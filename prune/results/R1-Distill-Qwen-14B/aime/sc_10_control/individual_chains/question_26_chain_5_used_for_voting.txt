Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. The sides of the triangle are given: AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. We need to find the length of AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Then, we're to find m + n.

Alright, so let me visualize this for a second. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. It's inscribed in a circle, so ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole or something related to the triangle. Then, connecting AD, which intersects the circumcircle again at P. So AP is the segment from A through D to the point P on the circle. We need to find its length.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point to a circle, the lengths of those tangents are equal. So, from D, the tangents to ω at B and C are both equal in length. That might be useful.

I think I remember some theorem related to poles and polars, but maybe I can approach this with power of a point. Since D is outside the circle ω, and we have two tangent segments DB and DC, which are equal. So the power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC².

Also, AD is a secant that passes through the circle, so by the power of point A with respect to ω, but wait, A is on the circle, so its power is zero. Hmm, maybe not directly helpful.

Wait, but D is outside, so the power of D is DB² = DC² = DP * DA. Because AD is a secant from D passing through A and P on the circle. So the power of D is equal to DP * DA.

Wait, let me think. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB², which is equal to DC² because the tangents from D to ω are equal. Also, since AD passes through ω at A and P, the power of D is also equal to DA * DP. So, yes, DB² = DA * DP.

So if I can find DB, DA, then I can solve for DP, and since AP = DP - DA? Wait, no. Wait, because DA is the segment from D to A, and DP is from D to P. Since P is on the other side of the circle from A, AP is actually DA + DP? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let's think in terms of lengths. Let me consider the points on line AD: starting from D, going towards A, then beyond A to P. So the order is D --- A --- P. So the length DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. So DP = DA + AP. So, the power of point D is DB² = DA * DP. So substituting, DB² = DA * (DA + AP). So if I can find DA and DB, I can solve for AP.

So, the plan is:
1. Find the circumradius of triangle ABC because the tangents from D to the circumcircle can be related to the circumradius.
2. Find the length DA in terms of other known quantities.
3. Use the power of point D to set up an equation involving DB² = DA * DP, then solve for AP.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to find the ratio AP/AD, which would then let me find AP once I have AD.

Wait, another thought: maybe use coordinate geometry or trigonometry to compute these lengths. But that might get messy. Alternatively, use inversion, but that might be too advanced.

Wait, perhaps use the properties of harmonic division or something related to poles and polars.

Alternatively, use Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me try to compute some key lengths first. Let's compute the circumradius R of triangle ABC. Because knowing R might help in computing DB, the tangent lengths.

Given sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me label the triangle: a = BC =9, b=AC=10, c=AB=5.

Wait, the standard notation is a = BC, b = AC, c=AB, opposite angles A, B, C respectively.

So, sides: a=9, b=10, c=5.

We can compute the circumradius R using the formula:

R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where Δ is the area of the triangle.

So first, compute Δ, the area. We can use Heron's formula.

Compute the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (9 + 10 +5)/2 = 24/2 =12.

Then, area Δ = sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)] = sqrt[12*(12-9)*(12-10)*(12-5)] = sqrt[12*3*2*7] = sqrt[504].

Simplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which isn't an integer. Wait, 504= 16*31.5? No, that's not right. Let's factor 504:

504 = 8 * 63 = 8 * 9 *7 = 8*9*7. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(8*9*7) = sqrt(8)*sqrt(9)*sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14).

So Δ = 6*sqrt(14).

So R = (a*b*c)/(4Δ) = (9*10*5)/(4*6*sqrt(14)).

Compute numerator: 9*10=90, 90*5=450.

Denominator: 4*6=24, 24*sqrt(14).

So R = 450/(24*sqrt(14)).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 6: 450 ÷6=75, 24÷6=4.

So R = 75/(4*sqrt(14)).

Rationalize the denominator: 75*sqrt(14)/(4*14) = 75*sqrt(14)/56.

So R = (75√14)/56.

Hmm, okay, that's the circumradius.

Now, the tangent from D to ω at B: the length DB is equal to DC, and the power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = OD² - R², but wait, I don't know the distance from O (the center) to D. Maybe that's getting too complicated.

Wait, but perhaps I can find DB in terms of other quantities. Wait, the power of D is DB² = DA * DP.

I need another approach. Maybe using triangle similarity or something else.

Wait, perhaps using the concept of the polar line. The polar of D with respect to ω is BC, because D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C. Therefore, the polar of D is BC, which implies that A lies on the polar of D if and only if D lies on the polar of A. Wait, I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, consider the inversion with respect to ω. But maybe that's overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps consider triangle ABC and point D. Since D is the exsimilicenter of the circumcircle, maybe some properties can be applied.

Alternatively, perhaps use coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let me place triangle ABC in a coordinate plane. Let me set point C at the origin (0,0), and point A on the x-axis at (10,0), since AC=10. Then point B is somewhere in the plane. Let's find the coordinates of point B.

Given AC=10, AB=5, BC=9.

So, coordinates: A=(10,0), C=(0,0). Let B=(x,y). Then, distance from A to B is 5: sqrt[(x-10)^2 + y^2] =5, so (x-10)^2 + y^2 =25.

Distance from B to C is 9: sqrt(x^2 + y^2) =9, so x^2 + y^2=81.

So we have two equations:

1. (x-10)^2 + y^2 =25
2. x^2 + y^2=81

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

(x-10)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) =25 -81
Expand (x-10)^2: x^2 -20x +100.

So, x^2 -20x +100 + y^2 -x^2 -y^2 = -56
Simplify: -20x +100 = -56
So, -20x = -156 → x=156/20=39/5=7.8.

So x=7.8, which is 39/5.

Then, from equation 2: x^2 + y^2=81.

Compute x^2: (39/5)^2 = 1521/25.

So y^2=81 -1521/25 = (2025 -1521)/25 = 504/25.

Thus, y= sqrt(504)/5 = (6*sqrt(14))/5. So y= (6√14)/5.

Therefore, point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5).

So coordinates are:

A=(10,0)

B=(39/5, 6√14/5)

C=(0,0)

Now, need to find point D, the intersection of the tangents at B and C.

The equation of tangent at a point on a circle can be found using the formula. First, let me find the equation of the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC.

We have points A, B, C. The circumcircle passes through all three, so we can find its equation.

Alternatively, since we already computed the circumradius R, and we know the coordinates of A, B, C, perhaps it's easier to compute the equation of the circle.

Let me find the circumcircle equation.

General equation of a circle: x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c=0.

Since points A=(10,0), B=(39/5, 6√14/5), C=(0,0) lie on it.

Plug in C=(0,0):

0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 → c=0.

So the equation is x² + y² +2gx + 2fy=0.

Plug in A=(10,0):

10² +0 +2g*10 +2f*0=0 → 100 +20g=0 → 20g = -100 → g= -5.

So now the equation is x² + y² -10x +2fy=0.

Now plug in point B=(39/5, 6√14/5):

(39/5)^2 + (6√14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) +2f*(6√14/5) =0.

Compute each term:

(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25.

(6√14/5)^2 = (36*14)/25 = 504/25.

-10*(39/5) = -78.

2f*(6√14/5) = (12√14 f)/5.

So adding all terms:

(1521 + 504)/25 -78 + (12√14 f)/5 =0.

Compute (1521 +504)=2025. So 2025/25 =81.

So 81 -78 + (12√14 f)/5 =0 → 3 + (12√14 f)/5 =0.

Thus, (12√14 f)/5 = -3 → f= (-3 *5)/(12√14)= (-15)/(12√14)= (-5)/(4√14).

Rationalize denominator: (-5√14)/(4*14)= (-5√14)/56.

So f= -5√14/56.

Thus, the equation of the circle ω is x² + y² -10x + 2*(-5√14/56)y =0.

Simplify the equation:

x² + y² -10x - (10√14/56)y =0.

Simplify 10√14/56: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 5√14/28.

So equation: x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

Alternatively, x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

Now, we can write this in standard form by completing the squares.

For x terms: x² -10x. Complete the square: (x -5)^2 -25.

For y terms: y² - (5√14/28)y. Let me see:

Coefficient of y is -5√14/28. Half of that is -5√14/(56). Square it: (25*14)/(56^2) = 350/(3136) = 25/224.

Wait, let me compute that again. (5√14/56)^2 = (25 *14)/(56^2) = 350/(3136) = 25/224.

So, y² - (5√14/28)y = [y - (5√14/56)]^2 - 25/224.

So, putting it all together:

(x -5)^2 -25 + [y - (5√14/56)]^2 -25/224 =0.

So, (x -5)^2 + [y - (5√14/56)]^2 =25 +25/224.

Convert 25 to 25*224/224= 5600/224.

So, 25 +25/224=5600/224 +25/224=5625/224.

So, the equation is (x -5)^2 + [y - (5√14/56)]^2 =5625/224.

So the center of ω is at (5,5√14/56), and radius squared is 5625/224.

Thus, radius R = sqrt(5625/224) = 75/sqrt(224).

Wait, okay, but perhaps I made a mistake here because earlier I computed R as (75√14)/56. Let me check that.

Because 5625/224: sqrt(5625/224) = 75/sqrt(224).

But sqrt(224)=sqrt(16*14)=4√14. So 75/(4√14) = (75√14)/(56), which matches the earlier computation. So yes, that's correct.

So, the center is at (5, 5√14/56), radius R=75√14/56.

Now, we need to find the equations of the tangents from D to ω at points B and C.

Wait, but actually, D is the intersection point of the tangents at B and C. So, if I can find the equations of the tangents at B and C, and then find their intersection point D, that would give me the coordinates of D.

Yes, that's a solid plan.

So, first, find the equation of the tangent at B.

The tangent at a point (x₁, y₁) on the circle x² + y² +2gx +2fy +c=0 is given by:

xx₁ + yy₁ + g(x +x₁) + f(y + y₁) + c =0.

Wait, since our circle equation is x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0, so in standard form, 2g = -10, so g= -5; 2f= -5√14/28, so f= -5√14/56; c=0.

So, the equation of the tangent at point (x₁,y₁) is:

x x₁ + y y₁ + g(x +x₁) + f(y + y₁) + c =0.

Wait, let me confirm. The standard formula for the tangent at (x₁,y₁) to the circle x² + y² +2gx +2fy +c=0 is:

x x₁ + y y₁ + g(x +x₁) + f(y + y₁) + c=0.

So, yes.

So, for point B=(39/5, 6√14/5), the tangent equation is:

x*(39/5) + y*(6√14/5) + (-5)(x +39/5) + (-5√14/56)(y +6√14/5) +0=0.

Simplify this equation step by step.

First, expand each term:

- x*(39/5) term: (39/5)x
- y*(6√14/5): (6√14/5)y
- -5*(x +39/5): -5x -5*(39/5) = -5x -39
- (-5√14/56)*(y +6√14/5): (-5√14/56)y - (5√14/56)*(6√14/5)

So, putting it all together:

(39/5)x + (6√14/5)y -5x -39 - (5√14/56)y - (5√14/56)*(6√14/5) =0.

Now, let me compute each term.

First, combine the x terms:

(39/5)x -5x = (39/5 -25/5)x = (14/5)x.

Next, combine the y terms:

(6√14/5)y - (5√14/56)y.

Let me factor out √14:

√14 [6/5 y -5/(56)y] = √14 [ (6*56 -5*5)/ (5*56) ) y ].

Compute numerator: 6*56=336, 5*5=25. 336-25=311.

So, √14*(311/(5*56)) y = (311√14)/(280) y.

Wait, let me check that calculation again.

Wait, 6/5 -5/56.

Compute 6/5 = 336/280, 5/56=25/280.

So, 336/280 -25/280 = 311/280.

So, the y terms combine to √14*(311/280)y = (311√14)/280 y.

Now, the constant terms:

-39 and the other term: - (5√14/56)*(6√14/5).

Compute that:

(5√14/56)*(6√14/5) = (5*6)*(√14*√14)/(56*5) )= 30*(14)/(280) )= (420)/(280)= 3/2.

So, the constant terms are -39 - 3/2 = -39 -1.5= -40.5= -81/2.

So, putting it all together, the equation is:

(14/5)x + (311√14/280)y -81/2=0.

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Let me see if I can simplify it.

Multiply both sides by 280 to eliminate denominators:

280*(14/5)x +280*(311√14/280)y -280*(81/2) =0.

Compute each term:

280*(14/5)x = (56*14)x=784x.

280*(311√14/280)y=311√14 y.

280*(81/2)=40*81=3240.

So, the equation becomes:

784x +311√14 y -3240=0.

That's the equation of the tangent at B.

Similarly, I need to find the equation of the tangent at C.

Point C is at (0,0), so plug into the tangent formula.

The tangent at C=(0,0):

x*0 + y*0 + (-5)(x +0) + (-5√14/56)(y +0) +0=0.

Simplify:

0 +0 -5x -5√14/56 y =0.

So, -5x - (5√14/56)y=0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

5x + (5√14/56)y=0.

We can write this as 5x + (5√14/56)y=0.

Alternatively, divide both sides by 5:

x + (√14/56)y=0.

But perhaps keep it as 5x + (5√14/56)y=0 for easier manipulation.

Now, we have two tangent equations:

1. Tangent at B: 784x +311√14 y -3240=0.

2. Tangent at C: 5x + (5√14/56)y=0.

We need to find their intersection point D.

Let me write equations 1 and 2 as:

Equation 1: 784x +311√14 y = 3240.

Equation 2: 5x + (5√14/56)y =0.

From equation 2, we can express x in terms of y.

Let me solve equation 2 for x:

5x = - (5√14/56)y → x= - (√14/56)y.

So, x= - (√14/56)y.

Now, substitute this into equation 1:

784*(-√14/56 y) +311√14 y =3240.

Compute each term:

784*(-√14)/56 = 784/56 * (-√14) =14*(-√14)= -14√14.

So, first term: -14√14 y.

Second term: 311√14 y.

So, combining terms:

(-14√14 +311√14) y =3240.

Compute coefficient:

(-14 +311)√14 =297√14.

So, 297√14 y =3240.

Solve for y:

y=3240/(297√14).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 9: 3240 ÷9=360, 297 ÷9=33.

So, y=360/(33√14).

Simplify 360/33: 360 ÷3=120, 33 ÷3=11. So, 120/11.

Thus, y= (120)/(11√14).

Rationalize denominator: (120√14)/(11*14)= (120√14)/(154)= (60√14)/77.

So, y=60√14/77.

Now, substitute y back into equation 2 to find x:

x= - (√14/56)y = - (√14/56)*(60√14/77).

Compute this:

Multiply the terms:

√14 *60√14 =60*(14)=840.

Denominator:56*77=4312.

So, x= -840/(4312).

Simplify 840/4312:

Divide numerator and denominator by 4: 210/1078.

Again, divide by 2: 105/539.

539 is 7*77=7*7*11. 105 is 15*7=3*5*7. So, common factor 7.

Divide numerator and denominator by7: 15/77.

So, x= -15/77.

So, point D has coordinates ( -15/77, 60√14/77 ).

Now, we have point A at (10, 0) and point D at (-15/77,60√14/77).

We need to find the equation of line AD.

Compute the slope of AD:

Slope m=( y_D - y_A )/(x_D -x_A ) = (60√14/77 -0)/( -15/77 -10 )= (60√14/77)/( (-15 -770)/77 )= (60√14/77)/( -785/77 )= (60√14)/(-785)= (-60√14)/785.

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: numerator: -12√14, denominator:157.

So, slope m= (-12√14)/157.

So, the equation of AD is y -0 = [ (-12√14)/157 ] (x -10).

So, y= [ (-12√14)/157 ] (x -10).

Now, we need to find the point P where AD intersects the circumcircle ω again.

We already know that A is on both AD and ω, so P is the other intersection point.

We can find P by solving the equation of AD and the equation of ω.

The equation of ω is (x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Alternatively, we can use the parametric equation of line AD and substitute into the circle equation.

Let me parameterize line AD.

Let parameter t vary from 0 to 1, with t=0 at A and t=1 at D.

Wait, but since we need P beyond D, perhaps it's better to use a different parameterization.

Alternatively, express line AD in parametric form.

Let me denote point A as (10,0), and vector AD as D - A = (-15/77 -10, 60√14/77 -0)= (-15/77 -770/77, 60√14/77)= (-785/77, 60√14/77).

So, parametric equations:

x=10 - (785/77)*t

y=0 + (60√14/77)*t

Where t=0 at A, t=1 at D, t>1 beyond D.

Now, substitute x and y into the equation of ω.

So, substitute x=10 - (785/77)t, y=(60√14/77)t into:

(x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Compute each term:

(x -5)^2 = [10 -785t/77 -5]^2 = [5 -785t/77]^2.

Similarly, (y -5√14/56)^2 = [60√14 t/77 -5√14/56]^2.

So, let's compute each squared term.

First term: [5 -785t/77]^2.

Second term: factor out √14:

√14 [60 t/77 -5/(56)].

So, the second term squared is 14*(60t/77 -5/56)^2.

So, putting it all together:

[5 -785t/77]^2 +14*(60t/77 -5/56)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Compute the right side:

(75√14/56)^2 = (75^2 *14)/(56^2)= (5625*14)/(3136)= 78750/3136.

Simplify 78750/3136:

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 39375/1568.

Not sure if that simplifies further.

Now, expand the left side:

First, expand [5 -785t/77]^2:

=25 - 2*5*(785t)/77 + (785t/77)^2

=25 - (7850t)/77 + (785² t²)/(77²).

Similarly, expand 14*(60t/77 -5/56)^2.

First, compute the square:

(60t/77 -5/56)^2.

Let me get common denominators for the terms inside the square.

Convert 60t/77 to x and 5/56 to y:

Find a common denominator for 77 and 56. 77=7*11, 56=8*7. So LCD is 7*8*11=616.

60t/77 = (60t *8)/616 =480t/616.

5/56 = (5 *11)/616=55/616.

So, 60t/77 -5/56 = (480t -55)/616.

Thus, (60t/77 -5/56)^2 = (480t -55)^2 / (616)^2.

So, 14*(480t -55)^2 / (616)^2.

So, putting it all together:

Left side of equation:

25 - (7850t)/77 + (785² t²)/(77²) + 14*(480t -55)^2 / (616)^2 =78750/3136.

This seems quite complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, since we already have the parametric equations, perhaps plug into the circle equation and solve for t.

Circle equation: (x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Substitute x=10 - (785/77)t, y=(60√14/77)t.

Compute (x-5)^2:

(5 -785t/77)^2 =25 - 2*5*(785t)/77 + (785t/77)^2.

Compute (y -5√14/56)^2:

(60√14 t/77 -5√14/56)^2.

Factor out √14:

√14 (60t/77 -5/(56)).

Wait, similar to before. Let me compute:

= [√14 (60t/77 -5/56)]^2 =14*(60t/77 -5/56)^2.

So, the equation becomes:

25 - (7850t)/77 + (785² t²)/(77²) +14*(60t/77 -5/56)^2 = (75² *14)/(56²).

Compute 75²=5625, 56²=3136, so right side is (5625*14)/3136=78750/3136.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First term:25.

Second term: -7850t/77.

Third term: (785² t²)/(77²).

Compute 785²: 785*785. Let me compute:

700²=490000.

85²=7225.

2*700*85=2*59500=119000.

So, (700+85)²=700² +2*700*85 +85²=490000+119000+7225=616225.

So, 785²=616225.

77²=5929.

So, third term:616225 t² /5929.

Fourth term:14*(60t/77 -5/56)^2.

Compute inside the square:

60t/77 -5/56.

Convert to common denominator, which is 616.

60t/77=480t/616.

5/56=55/616.

So, 60t/77 -5/56 = (480t -55)/616.

Thus, (60t/77 -5/56)^2=(480t -55)^2/(616)^2.

Multiply by 14:

14*(480t -55)^2/(616)^2.

Note that 616=77*8, 616=77*8=7*11*8.

So, 616²=77² *64=5929*64.

So, 14*(480t -55)^2/(5929*64).

Simplify 14/64=7/32.

So, 7*(480t -55)^2/(5929*32).

Wait, perhaps this is getting too involved. Maybe instead of expanding, plug into the equation numerically.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that point A is on both the line AD and the circle, so t=0 is a solution. Then, the other solution corresponds to t=t_P, which is the parameter value for point P.

So, when we substitute x and y in terms of t into the circle equation, we get a quadratic equation in t, with one root at t=0 (point A) and the other root at t=t_P (point P). So, we can factor out t and solve for the other root.

Let me compute the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation:

(x-5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2.

Expressed in terms of t:

[5 - (785t/77)]^2 + [ (60√14 t/77) -5√14/56 ]^2.

Factor out √14 from the second term:

= [5 - (785t/77)]^2 + [√14 (60t/77 -5/(56))]^2.

= [5 - (785t/77)]^2 +14*(60t/77 -5/56)^2.

Set equal to R²=(75√14/56)^2= (75^2 *14)/(56^2)=5625*14/3136=78750/3136.

So, equation:

[5 - (785t/77)]^2 +14*(60t/77 -5/56)^2 =78750/3136.

Let me compute each part:

First, expand [5 - (785t/77)]^2:

=25 - 2*5*(785t/77) + (785t/77)^2.

=25 - (7850t)/77 + (616225 t²)/(5929).

Second, expand 14*(60t/77 -5/56)^2.

Compute inside the square:

60t/77 -5/56.

Let me compute this as a single fraction:

Find LCD of 77 and 56, which is 616.

60t/77 = (60t *8)/616=480t/616.

5/56=55/616.

So, 60t/77 -5/56= (480t -55)/616.

So, square is (480t -55)^2/(616)^2.

Multiply by 14:

14*(480t -55)^2/(616)^2.

Simplify 14/616²:

616=77*8, so 616²=77²*8²=5929*64.

14/(5929*64)= (14)/(379,  5929*64=379, 616²=379,  5929*64=379,  let me compute 5929*64:

5929*64=5929*(60+4)=5929*60 +5929*4=355,740 +23,716=379,456.

So, 14/379,456=7/189,728.

So, 14*(480t -55)^2/(616)^2=7*(480t -55)^2/(189,728).

But this seems messy. Let me see if I can compute the entire LHS.

Compute LHS:

=25 - (7850t)/77 + (616225 t²)/(5929) +14*( (480t -55)^2 )/(616)^2.

Compute 14*(480t -55)^2/(616)^2.

Compute (480t -55)^2= (480t)^2 - 2*480t*55 +55²=230400 t² -52800t +3025.

So, 14*(230400 t² -52800t +3025)/(616)^2.

Compute denominator:616^2=379,456.

So,

14*(230400 t² -52800t +3025)/379,456.

Simplify:

14/379,456=7/189,728.

So,

7*(230400 t² -52800t +3025)/189,728.

Compute numerator:

7*(230400 t² -52800t +3025)=1,612,800 t² -369,600t +21,175.

So, that term is (1,612,800 t² -369,600t +21,175)/189,728.

Now, combine all terms in LHS:

25 - (7850t)/77 + (616,225 t²)/(5,929) + (1,612,800 t² -369,600t +21,175)/189,728.

Convert all terms to have a common denominator, which would be 189,728.

But this seems too complicated. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, since we know t=0 is a solution, we can factor (t) from the equation and find the other root.

The equation is quadratic in t: At² + Bt + C=0.

Given that t=0 is a root, C=0. So, the equation reduces to t(At + B)=0.

Thus, the other root is t= -B/A.

So, maybe compute the coefficients A and B.

Alternatively, note that when t=0, the point is A; when t=1, the point is D. But we need t_P such that P is the other intersection.

So, perhaps compute the product of the roots, which is C/A=0, but since one root is t=0, the other root is t_P= -B/A.

Alternatively, perhaps compute the equation and identify coefficients.

But this is getting really involved. Maybe a different approach.

Alternatively, since AD is a secant, and we have DA * DP = DB².

We have already computed DB²= (length of tangent)^2.

Wait, from point D to ω, the power is DB² = DC² = DA * DP.

So, if I can compute DA, and then set DB²=DA * DP, then solve for DP.

But to compute DA, we can compute the distance between A and D.

Point A is at (10,0), point D is at (-15/77,60√14/77).

So, DA distance squared is:

(10 +15/77)^2 + (0 -60√14/77)^2.

Compute each term:

10 +15/77= (770 +15)/77=785/77.

So, (785/77)^2= (785²)/(77²)=616,225/5,929.

Second term: (60√14/77)^2= (3,600 *14)/ (77²)=50,400/5,929.

So, DA²=616,225/5,929 +50,400/5,929=666,625/5,929.

Thus, DA= sqrt(666,625/5,929)=sqrt(666,625)/sqrt(5,929).

Compute sqrt(5,929): 77^2=5,929, so sqrt(5,929)=77.

sqrt(666,625): Let's see, 816^2=665,856, which is less than 666,625. 817^2=667,489. So, between 816 and 817. Let's see:

Compute 816.5^2= (816 +0.5)^2=816² +2*816*0.5 +0.25=665,856 +816 +0.25=666,672.25.

But DA²=666,625/5,929≈666,625/5,929≈112.45.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute DA= sqrt(666,625)/77.

Compute sqrt(666,625).

Let me see: 666,625 ÷25=26,665.

sqrt(26,665)≈163.3.

Wait, 163^2=26,569; 164^2=26,896. So, between 163 and 164.

But 26,665-26,569=96. So, 163 +96/ (2*163 +1)= ~163.3.

So, sqrt(26,665)=~163.3.

Thus, sqrt(666,625)=sqrt(25*26,665)=5*163.3≈816.5.

Wait, that matches the earlier calculation.

Thus, DA≈816.5/77≈10.6.

But that's approximate. Maybe I can find an exact expression.

Wait, 666,625= 625*1,066.6? Wait, perhaps factor 666,625.

Let me see: 666,625 divided by 25 is 26,665.

26,665: sum of digits 2+6+6+6+5=25, which is not divisible by 3. Let me try dividing by 5: 26,665/5=5,333.

5,333: Check if prime. Let me test divisibility by small primes.

5,333 ÷7= 761.857… nope.

5,333 ÷11=484.818… nope.

5,333 ÷13=410.23… nope.

Wait, perhaps 5,333 is prime? Not sure. Let me check: 5,333.

Wait, 73^2=5,329. So 5,333-5,329=4. So, 5,333=73^2 +4. Not a square.

So, perhaps 666,625=25*5*5,333=125*5,333.

Thus, sqrt(666,625)=sqrt(125*5,333)=5*sqrt(5*5,333).

Not helpful. So, perhaps we can leave DA²=666,625/5,929.

Wait, 666,625 ÷5,929: let me compute 5,929*112= 5,929*100=592,900; 5,929*12=71,148. So, 592,900+71,148=664,048. That's 112*5,929=664,048.

Subtract from 666,625:666,625 -664,048=2,577.

So, 666,625=5,929*112 +2,577.

Wait, 5,929*112=664,048.

So, 666,625=5,929*112 +2,577.

But 2,577 is less than 5,929, so not helpful.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute DA*DP=DB².

We can compute DB², which is the square of the tangent from D to ω.

Wait, but we can compute DB as the distance from D to B.

Point D is at (-15/77,60√14/77), point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5).

Compute DB²:

( x_B -x_D )² + ( y_B - y_D )².

Compute x difference: 39/5 - (-15/77)=39/5 +15/77.

Convert to common denominator, which is 385.

39/5= (39*77)/385=2928/385.

15/77= (15*5)/385=75/385.

So, 39/5 +15/77=2928/385 +75/385=3003/385.

Similarly, y difference:6√14/5 -60√14/77.

Factor out √14:

√14*(6/5 -60/77).

Compute 6/5 -60/77.

Convert to common denominator 385.

6/5=462/385.

60/77=300/385.

So, 462/385 -300/385=162/385.

Thus, y difference=√14*(162/385)= (162√14)/385.

So, DB²= (3003/385)^2 + (162√14/385)^2.

Compute each term:

(3003)^2= (3,000 +3)^2=9,000,000 +18,000 +9=9,018,009.

So, (3003/385)^2=9,018,009/(385²)=9,018,009/148,225.

Similarly, (162√14)^2=162² *14=26,244 *14=367,416.

Thus, (162√14/385)^2=367,416/(385²)=367,416/148,225.

So, DB²=9,018,009/148,225 +367,416/148,225= (9,018,009 +367,416)/148,225=9,385,425/148,225.

Simplify 9,385,425 ÷148,225:

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: numerator=375,417, denominator=5,929.

So, 375,417 ÷5,929.

Compute 5,929*63=5,929*60=355,740; 5,929*3=17,787. Total=355,740+17,787=373,527.

Subtract from 375,417:375,417 -373,527=1,890.

Now, 5,929 goes into 1,890 zero times. So, 375,417=5,929*63 +1,890.

Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, 375,417 and 5,929.

5,929 is 77^2.

Check if 77 divides 375,417.

375,417 ÷77: 77*4,875=77*(4,800 +75)=77*4,800=369,600 +77*75=5,775 → total 369,600+5,775=375,375.

Subtract from 375,417:375,417-375,375=42.

So, 375,417=77*4,875 +42.

Thus, 375,417=77*(4,875) +42.

So, 375,417/5,929= (77*4,875 +42)/ (77^2)= (4,875 +42/77)/77.

But 42/77=6/11.

So, 375,417/5,929= (4,875 +6/11)/77= ( (4,875*11 +6)/11 ) /77= (53,625 +6)/ (11*77)=53,631/(847).

Check if 53,631 and 847 have common factors.

847=7*11*11.

53,631 ÷11=4,875.545… not integer. 53,631 ÷7=7,661.571… not integer. So, 53,631/847 is reduced.

Thus, DB²=53,631/847.

Wait, but earlier I had DB²=9,385,425/148,225= (9,385,425 ÷25)/(148,225 ÷25)=375,417/5,929= same as above.

So, DB²=53,631/847.

But that's a fraction. Now, going back to the power of point D: DB²=DA *DP.

We have DB²=53,631/847.

We have DA²=666,625/5,929. So, DA= sqrt(666,625/5,929)=sqrt(666,625)/77.

Wait, but 666,625=25*26,665. 26,665=5*5,333. So, 666,625=25*5*5,333=125*5,333.

So, DA= sqrt(125*5,333)/77=5*sqrt(5*5,333)/77.

Hmm, not helpful. Maybe compute DA*DP=DB².

Express DP= DB² / DA.

So, AP= DP - DA? No, because P is beyond D on the line AD, so AP= AD + DP? Wait, no.

Wait, point A is on the circle, so the line AD passes through A, then D, then P. Wait, no, because D is outside the circle, so the order is D---A---P.

Wait, no, actually, if D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, and AD is passing through A and P, which is another point on the circle. So, the order is D---A---P.

Wait, no. If A is on the circle, and D is outside, then line AD passes through D, then A, then P. So, the order is D---A---P. So, DA is from D to A, and DP is from D to P, which is DA + AP.

So, DP= DA + AP.

So, from power of a point: DB²= DA * DP= DA*(DA + AP).

We can write DB²= DA² + DA*AP.

We need to find AP.

So, rearrange:

DB² - DA² = DA * AP.

Thus, AP= (DB² - DA²)/DA.

So, AP= (DB²/DA) - DA.

Compute DB² and DA.

We have DB²=53,631/847.

DA²=666,625/5,929.

So, DA= sqrt(666,625)/77.

So, (DB²)/DA= (53,631/847)/ (sqrt(666,625)/77)= (53,631/847)*(77)/sqrt(666,625).

Simplify:

53,631 ÷847= let's compute.

847*63=53,  847*60=50,820; 847*3=2,541. So, 50,820 +2,541=53,361.

Subtract from 53,631:53,631 -53,361=270.

So, 53,631=847*63 +270.

270 ÷847=270/847.

So, 53,631/847=63 +270/847.

Thus,

(DB²)/DA= [63 +270/847]*77/sqrt(666,625).

Multiply numerator:

63*77=4,851.

270*77=20,790.

So,

= (4,851 +20,790/847)/sqrt(666,625).

Wait, 20,790 ÷847=24.522 approximately.

But, perhaps 20,790 ÷847=24.522.

But exact fraction: 20,790 ÷847=20,790 ÷ (7*11^2)=20,790 ÷847.

Let me compute 847*24=20,328.

20,790-20,328=462.

So, 847*24 +462=20,790.

So, 462/847= 462 ÷847= divide numerator and denominator by 7: 66/121.

So, 20,790/847=24 +66/121.

Thus,

(DB²)/DA= [4,851 +24 +66/121]/sqrt(666,625)= [4,875 +66/121]/sqrt(666,625).

Now, 4,875 +66/121=4,875.545.

But this is getting too messy. Maybe I should instead compute numerically.

Compute DB²=53,631/847≈53,631 ÷847≈63.29.

DA²=666,625/5,929≈112.45.

So, DA= sqrt(112.45)≈10.6.

Thus, DA≈10.6.

Then, DB²≈63.29=DA*DP=10.6*DP→ DP≈63.29/10.6≈5.97.

Then, AP= DP - DA=5.97 -10.6= -4.63? That can't be, since length can't be negative.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the order of points.

Wait, AP is the segment from A to P. Since D is outside the circle, and AD passes through A and P, with A inside the circle? Wait, no, A is on the circle. So, D is outside, A is on the circle, and P is the other intersection point on the circle, so AP is the chord passing through A and P.

Wait, no. If AD is extended beyond A, it would exit the circle at P. But in our case, since D is outside, and A is on the circle, then AD meets the circle again at P on the extension beyond A.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because AD starts at D (outside), goes through A (on the circle), and then exits the circle again at P on the other side.

But wait, in the Asymptote code, it's drawn as A connected to D, and then D connected to P, which is on the circle. So, AD intersects the circle again at P, meaning that starting from D, going through A, and then to P.

Wait, in that case, the order is D---A---P. So DA is from D to A, and DP is from D to P, so DP=DA + AP.

So, the power of point D is DB²=DA * DP= DA*(DA + AP). So,

DB²=DA² + DA*AP → DA*AP= DB² - DA² → AP= (DB² - DA²)/DA.

So, yes, AP= (DB² - DA²)/DA.

Compute DB²=53,631/847≈63.29.

DA²=666,625/5,929≈112.45.

So, DB² - DA²≈63.29 -112.45≈-49.16.

Then, AP≈ (-49.16)/10.6≈-4.64.

Wait, that's negative, which doesn't make sense because lengths are positive.

Hmm, that suggests a mistake in the approach. Maybe the assumption about the order of points is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the order is D---P---A, meaning that P is between D and A. So, DP= DA - AP.

Wait, but A is on the circle, so if AD intersects the circle at A and P, and D is outside, then P must lie between D and A.

Wait, that would make sense because when you draw a secant from D through A, since A is on the circle, P must be inside the segment DA.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because A is on the circle, the line DA starts at D (outside), passes through A (on the circle), and then exits the circle again at another point P on the extension beyond A.

So, the order is D---A---P.

Thus, DP= DA + AP.

So, the power of point D is DB²=DA * DP= DA*(DA + AP).

So, DB²= DA² + DA*AP → DA*AP= DB² - DA² → AP= (DB² - DA²)/DA.

But with DB² < DA², this gives a negative AP, which is impossible.

Thus, I must have made a mistake in computing DB².

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing DB².

Wait, DB is the tangent from D to ω. So, the length DB should satisfy DB²=DA * DP.

But according to our earlier calculation, DB²≈63.29, DA≈10.6, so if DA * DP=63.29, then DP≈63.29/10.6≈5.97.

But then, AP= DP - DA=5.97 -10.6≈-4.63, which is negative.

This suggests that perhaps the order is D---P---A, meaning that P is between D and A, so AP= DA - DP.

In that case, DA * DP= DB² → DP= DB² / DA.

Thus, AP= DA - DP= DA - (DB² / DA)= (DA² - DB²)/DA.

So, AP= (DA² - DB²)/DA.

Compute DA²=666,625/5,929≈112.45.

DB²=53,631/847≈63.29.

So, DA² - DB²≈112.45 -63.29≈49.16.

Thus, AP≈49.16/10.6≈4.64.

So, approximately 4.64, which is about 4.64=464/100=116/25=4.64.

But the exact value is needed.

So, AP= (DA² - DB²)/DA.

Compute DA² - DB²= (666,625/5,929) - (53,631/847).

Convert to common denominator.

847=7*11^2.

5,929=77^2=7^2*11^2.

So, LCD=5,929.

Convert 53,631/847 to denominator 5,929:

53,631/847= (53,631 *7)/ (847 *7)=375,417/5,929.

Thus,

DA² - DB²=666,625/5,929 -375,417/5,929= (666,625 -375,417)/5,929=291,208/5,929.

Simplify 291,208 ÷5,929.

Compute 5,929*49=5,929*50=296,450 -5,929=290,521.

Subtract from 291,208:291,208 -290,521=687.

So, 291,208=5,929*49 +687.

So, 291,208/5,929=49 +687/5,929.

Simplify 687/5,929.

Check if 687 and 5,929 have common factors.

5,929 ÷687≈8.62. 687=3*229.

5,929 ÷229=26. So, 229*26=5,954, which is more than 5,929. So, no, 229 doesn't divide 5,929.

Thus, 687/5,929 is reduced.

So, DA² - DB²=49 +687/5,929.

Then, AP= (DA² - DB²)/DA= [49 +687/5,929]/DA.

But DA= sqrt(666,625/5,929)=sqrt(666,625)/77.

As earlier, sqrt(666,625)=sqrt(25*26,665)=5*sqrt(26,665).

So, DA=5*sqrt(26,665)/77.

Thus, AP= [49 +687/5,929]/(5*sqrt(26,665)/77).

This is complicated. Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator:49 +687/5,929= (49*5,929 +687)/5,929.

Compute 49*5,929:

5,929 *50=296,450.

Subtract 5,929:296,450 -5,929=290,521.

Add 687:290,521 +687=291,208.

So, numerator=291,208/5,929.

Denominator=5*sqrt(26,665)/77.

So, AP= (291,208/5,929) / (5*sqrt(26,665)/77)= (291,208/5,929) * (77)/(5*sqrt(26,665)).

Simplify:

291,208 ÷5,929=49.089 (approx).

77/5=15.4.

So, AP≈49.089 *15.4 /sqrt(26,665).

Compute sqrt(26,665)≈163.3.

So,

AP≈49.089 *15.4 /163.3≈(49.089 *15.4)= approx 755.2 /163.3≈4.625.

Which is about 4.625=37/8=4.875. Wait, no, 4.625=37/8=4.625.

Wait, but I need the exact value.

So, let's compute AP= (DA² - DB²)/DA= (291,208/5,929)/(sqrt(666,625/5,929)).

Which is equal to (291,208/5,929) / (sqrt(666,625)/77).

Simplify:

= (291,208/5,929) * (77)/sqrt(666,625).

Factor numerator and denominator:

291,208= 8 *36,401.

Wait, 36,401 ÷77=473. So, 36,401=77*473.

So, 291,208=8*77*473.

And sqrt(666,625)=sqrt(25*26,665)=5*sqrt(26,665).

So,

AP= (8*77*473)/(5,929) *77/(5*sqrt(26,665)).

Wait, 5,929=77².

So,

AP= (8*77*473)/(77²) *77/(5*sqrt(26,665)).

Simplify:

= (8*473)/(77) *77/(5*sqrt(26,665)).

The 77 cancels:

=8*473/(5*sqrt(26,665)).

Now, compute 8*473=3,784.

So, AP=3,784/(5*sqrt(26,665)).

Rationalize the denominator:

=3,784*sqrt(26,665)/(5*26,665).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

3,784 and 26,665.

Check if 26,665 ÷5=5,333.

So, denominator:5*26,665=5*(5*5,333)=25*5,333.

So,

AP=3,784*sqrt(26,665)/(25*5,333).

Check if 3,784 and 5,333 have common factors.

3,784 ÷8=473.

5,333 ÷473≈11.27. 473*11=5,203, 473*11.27≈5,333. So, 473 is a factor? Let me check.

5,333 ÷473: 473*11=5,203. 5,333 -5,203=130. 473 doesn't divide 130. So, 473 and 5,333 are coprime.

Thus, AP= (3,784*sqrt(26,665))/(25*5,333).

But this seems very complicated, and I think I'm missing a smarter approach.

Wait, perhaps using cross ratios or harmonic division.

Alternatively, use inversion with respect to the circumcircle.

Alternatively, use the theorem that in such configurations, AP= (AB*AC)/BC.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, use Stewart's theorem or something else.

Alternatively, use coordinates but compute parametrically.

Wait, maybe parametrize line AD and find its intersection with the circle.

We have parametric equations:

x=10 - (785/77)t.

y=0 + (60√14/77)t.

Substitute into the circle equation:

(x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Compute each term:

(x -5)=5 -785t/77.

(y -5√14/56)= (60√14 t/77) -5√14/56.

Let me compute each squared term:

First term: [5 -785t/77]^2.

Second term: [√14*(60t/77 -5/56)]^2=14*(60t/77 -5/56)^2.

Thus, equation:

[5 -785t/77]^2 +14*(60t/77 -5/56)^2 = (75² *14)/(56²).

Compute RHS:75²=5625, 56²=3136. So, 5625*14=78,750. Thus, RHS=78,750/3136= approx 25.12.

But let's compute it as a fraction:78,750/3136=39,375/1568.

Now, expand the LHS:

[5 -785t/77]^2=25 - 2*5*(785t)/77 + (785t/77)^2=25 - (7,850t)/77 + (616,225 t²)/5,929.

Second term:14*(60t/77 -5/56)^2.

First, compute inside the square:

60t/77 -5/56.

Common denominator 616:

60t/77=480t/616.

5/56=55/616.

So, 60t/77 -5/56=(480t -55)/616.

Thus, (60t/77 -5/56)^2=(480t -55)^2/(616)^2.

Multiply by 14:

14*(480t -55)^2/(616)^2.

Simplify:

14/(616²)=14/(379,456)=7/189,728.

So, second term becomes 7*(480t -55)^2/189,728.

Now, the equation is:

25 - (7,850t)/77 + (616,225 t²)/5,929 +7*(480t -55)^2/189,728=39,375/1568.

This is a quadratic equation in t. Since t=0 is a solution (point A), the other solution will give us t_P.

But solving this equation seems too complicated. Perhaps factor t from the equation.

Alternatively, consider that the product of the roots t1*t2= C/A.

But this is getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that AP/AD= (DB²)/(AD^2 +DB²).

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, use inversion.

Alternatively, consider triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.

Using the Law of Cosines to find angles.

Compute angle at A.

cos A=(b² +c² -a²)/(2bc)= (10² +5² -9²)/(2*10*5)= (100 +25 -81)/100=44/100=11/25.

So, angle A has cos A=11/25.

Thus, sin A= sqrt(1 - (121/625))=sqrt(504/625)= (6√14)/25.

So, area Δ= (1/2)*AB*AC*sin A= (1/2)*5*10*(6√14/25)= (1/2)*50*(6√14/25)= (25)*(6√14/25)=6√14.

Which matches our earlier computation.

Now, perhaps use trigonometric Ceva's theorem or something else.

Alternatively, use coordinates again but compute AP.

Wait, since I have the coordinates of A, D, and P lies on AD, I can write parametric equations and solve.

Given that AD is parameterized as:

x=10 - (785/77)t.

y=0 + (60√14/77)t.

And P lies on the circumcircle. So, substitute into the circle equation:

(x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2= (75√14/56)^2.

Expand and solve for t.

But this is what I was trying earlier, which got too complicated.

Alternatively, use the parametric form and set up the equation.

Let me denote t as the parameter, with t=0 at A, t=1 at D.

So, substituting x=10 - (785/77)t, y=(60√14/77)t into the circle equation.

Compute each term:

(x -5)=5 -785t/77.

(y -5√14/56)=60√14 t/77 -5√14/56=√14*(60t/77 -5/56).

Thus, the equation becomes:

[5 -785t/77]^2 + [√14*(60t/77 -5/56)]^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Compute each squared term:

First term: [5 -785t/77]^2=25 - 2*5*(785t)/77 + (785t/77)^2=25 - (7850t)/77 + (616,225 t²)/5,929.

Second term: [√14*(60t/77 -5/56)]^2=14*(60t/77 -5/56)^2.

Compute inside:

60t/77 -5/56= (480t -55)/616.

So, [√14*(60t/77 -5/56)]^2=14*(480t -55)^2/(616)^2.

So, LHS becomes:

25 - (7,850t)/77 + (616,225 t²)/5,929 +14*(480t -55)^2/379,456.

Set equal to RHS:

(75√14/56)^2= (5625*14)/3136=78,750/3136=39,375/1568.

So, equation:

25 - (7,850t)/77 + (616,225 t²)/5,929 +14*(480t -55)^2/379,456=39,375/1568.

Multiply all terms by 379,456 to eliminate denominators.

Compute LHS:

25*379,456=9,486,400.

- (7,850t)/77 *379,456= -7,850t * (379,456/77).

Compute 379,456 ÷77=4,930.56... Wait, 77*4,930=379,410, remainder 46. So, 379,456=77*4,930 +46.

Thus, 379,456/77=4,930 +46/77=4,930 + 2/3.5.

But perhaps keep as fraction.

So, -7,850t*(379,456/77)= -7,850t*(4,930 +46/77)= ?

This is getting too messy. I think I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps use power of a point with inversion.

Alternatively, use the formula for the length of a chord intersected by a secant.

The formula is AP= (AB * AC)/BC.

Wait, is that a valid formula? Let me think.

In some cases, the length of a chord can be related to the sides of the triangle, but I'm not sure about that formula.

Alternatively, use the theorem that relates the length of AP to the sides of the triangle.

Wait, I recall that in such configurations, AP= (AB * AC)/BC.

Let me test that.

AB=5, AC=10, BC=9.

So, AP= (5*10)/9=50/9≈5.555...

But earlier approximation was around 4.6, so that might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps AP= (AB² + AC²)/BC.

But that would be (25 +100)/9=125/9≈13.88, which seems too big.

Alternatively, use the formula from triangle geometry.

Wait, since D is the exsimilicenter of the circumcircle, maybe use properties related to that.

Alternatively, use trigonometric Ceva's theorem.

Wait, perhaps use the fact that AD is the symmedian.

Wait, because D is the intersection of tangents, so AD is the symmedian.

In that case, the length can be computed using the formula for the symmedian.

The formula for the length of the symmedian from A is:

AP= (2bc cos (A/2))/ (b +c).

But wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, use the formula for the symmedian length:

AP= (2b²c²)/(b² +c²) * (1/(b +c)).

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, let me recall that the length of the symmedian can be given by:

AP= (2b²c²)/(b² +c²) * cos A.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, use the formula:

AP= (2bc/(b +c)) * cos(A/2).

But maybe that's for the median.

Wait, no, the median length is different.

Alternatively, use Stewart's theorem.

Wait, Stewart's theorem relates the length of a cevian to the sides of the triangle.

But in this case, AD is not a cevian but a line from A to D outside the triangle.

Wait, perhaps use Stewart's theorem on triangle ABC with cevian AD, but since D is outside, it might complicate.

Alternatively, use the Law of Cosines in triangle ABD or something.

Wait, but I don't know BD.

Hmm.

Wait, going back to the power of a point: DB²=DA * DP.

We have DB²=53,631/847≈63.29.

DA≈10.6, so DP=63.29/10.6≈5.97.

Thus, AP= DP - DA=5.97 -10.6≈-4.63. Negative, which is impossible.

So, perhaps my mistake is in the order of points.

Wait, maybe the order is D---P---A, so that DP= DA - AP.

In that case, DB²=DA * DP= DA*(DA - AP).

So,

DB²=DA² - DA*AP → DA*AP= DA² - DB² → AP= (DA² - DB²)/DA.

Which is positive.

So, AP= (DA² - DB²)/DA.

Compute DA²=666,625/5,929≈112.45.

DB²=53,631/847≈63.29.

So, DA² - DB²≈112.45 -63.29≈49.16.

Thus, AP≈49.16/10.6≈4.64.

So, approximately 4.64=464/100=116/25=4.64.

But let's compute exactly:

AP= (DA² - DB²)/DA.

DA²=666,625/5,929.

DB²=53,631/847= (53,631 *7)/ (847 *7)=375,417/5,929.

Thus,

DA² - DB²= (666,625 -375,417)/5,929=291,208/5,929.

Now, AP= (291,208/5,929)/DA.

But DA= sqrt(666,625/5,929)=sqrt(666,625)/77.

So,

AP= (291,208/5,929) / (sqrt(666,625)/77)= (291,208/5,929)*(77)/sqrt(666,625).

Simplify numerator:

291,208 *77=22,440,  let me compute 291,208*70=20,384,560; 291,208*7=2,038,456. Total=20,384,560 +2,038,456=22,423,016.

Wait, 291,208 *77=291,208*(70+7)=291,208*70 +291,208*7.

Compute 291,208*70=20,384,560.

Compute 291,208*7=2,038,456.

Adding them:20,384,560 +2,038,456=22,423,016.

So, numerator=22,423,016.

Denominator=5,929 *sqrt(666,625).

Compute sqrt(666,625)=sqrt(25*26,665)=5*sqrt(26,665).

So, denominator=5,929*5*sqrt(26,665)=29,645*sqrt(26,665).

Thus,

AP=22,423,016/(29,645*sqrt(26,665)).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Factor numerator and denominator:

22,423,016 ÷4=5,605,754.

29,645 ÷5=5,929.

So,

AP= (5,605,754*4)/(5,929*5*sqrt(26,665)).

Wait, not helpful.

Alternatively, factor numerator and denominator:

22,423,016= 22,423,016= 4*5,605,754.

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps 22,423,016 and 29,645 have common factors.

Compute GCD(22,423,016,29,645).

Compute 22,423,016 ÷29,645.

29,645 *756=29,645*(700 +50 +6)=29,645*700=20,751,500; 29,645*50=1,482,250; 29,645*6=177,870. Total=20,751,500 +1,482,250=22,233,750 +177,870=22,411,620.

Subtract from 22,423,016:22,423,016 -22,411,620=11,396.

Now, compute GCD(29,645,11,396).

29,645 ÷11,396=2 with remainder 29,645 -2*11,396=29,645 -22,792=6,853.

GCD(11,396,6,853).

11,396 ÷6,853=1 with remainder 11,396 -6,853=4,543.

GCD(6,853,4,543).

6,853 ÷4,543=1 with remainder 6,853 -4,543=2,310.

GCD(4,543,2,310).

4,543 ÷2,310=1 with remainder 4,543 -2,310=2,233.

GCD(2,310,2,233).

2,310 ÷2,233=1 with remainder 77.

GCD(2,233,77).

2,233 ÷77=29 with remainder 2,233 -77*29=2,233 -2,233=0.

So, GCD is77.

Thus, GCD of 22,423,016 and29,645 is77.

So, divide numerator and denominator by77.

Numerator:22,423,016 ÷77=291,208.

Denominator:29,645 ÷77=385.

So, AP=291,208/(385*sqrt(26,665)).

But 291,208 ÷385=757.6.

Wait, 385*757=291, 385*700=269,500; 385*57=21,  385*50=19,250; 385*7=2,695. So, 269,500 +19,250=288,750 +2,695=291,445.

But 291,208 -291,445= negative, so my approximation is off.

Wait, 385*756=385*(700 +50 +6)=269,500 +19,250 +2,310=291,060.

291,208 -291,060=148.

So, 291,208=385*756 +148.

Thus, AP= (385*756 +148)/(385*sqrt(26,665))=756 +148/(385*sqrt(26,665)).

But this doesn't help much.

I think I'm stuck here. Maybe I made a mistake in earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps instead of computing coordinates, use the formula for the length of AP in terms of triangle sides.

I found a formula that says AP= (AB² + AC²)/BC.

Wait, let's test it.

AB=5, AC=10, BC=9.

AP= (25 +100)/9=125/9≈13.88. But earlier approximation was ~4.6, so that can't be.

Alternatively, use the formula AP= (AB * AC * (AB + AC))/BC².

But AP= (5*10*(5+10))/81= (50*15)/81=750/81≈9.259. Still not matching.

Alternatively, use the formula from the properties of poles and polars.

Since D is the pole of BC, and AD is the polar of P.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, use the fact that AP * AD= AB * AC.

Wait, that can't be because AP * AD=5 *10=50, but AD is about10.6, so AP=50/10.6≈4.716, which is close to our earlier estimate.

But is this a general formula?

Wait, I think in some cases, AP= (AB * AC)/BC.

But in our case, that would be (5*10)/9≈5.555, which is close to our approximate result but not exact.

Alternatively, use the formula for the length of the chord through A and P.

In the circumcircle, the length of chord AP can be found using the Law of Cosines if we know the angle.

But we know angle at A is cos⁻¹(11/25).

The chord length AP=2R sin(theta), where theta is half the angle subtended by AP at the center.

But I don't know theta.

Alternatively, AP=2R sin(angle at A /2).

Wait, angle at A is angle BAC, which we computed as cos⁻¹(11/25).

So, AP=2R sin( (angle BAC)/2 ).

Compute angle BAC: cos A=11/25, so sin(A/2)=sqrt( (1 -cos A)/2 )=sqrt( (1 -11/25)/2 )=sqrt( (14/25)/2 )=sqrt(7/25)=√7/5.

Thus, AP=2R*(√7/5)=2*(75√14/56)*(√7/5)= (150√14/56)*(√7/5)= (150√98)/(280).

Simplify √98=7√2.

So, AP=150*7√2 /280=1050√2 /280=105√2/28=15√2/4.

Wait, that's a nice expression. But does this match our earlier approximate value?

15√2/4≈15*1.4142/4≈21.213/4≈5.303.

Which is close to our approximate 4.64 but not exact. So, maybe this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Because AP is not necessarily the chord through A with angle A/2.

Alternatively, perhaps use the extended Law of Sines.

In triangle ABC, a=9, b=10, c=5.

Circumradius R=75√14/56.

The chord length AP can be found if we know the angle subtended by AP at the center.

But without knowing that angle, it's hard.

Alternatively, use the fact that AP is the image of AD under inversion, but I don't have enough information.

Alternatively, use triangle areas.

Wait, another idea: Use coordinates to find the intersection point P, then compute AP.

But as earlier, solving the quadratic equation seems too involved.

Alternatively, use parametric line equations.

We have parametric equations for AD:

x=10 - (785/77)t.

y=0 + (60√14/77)t.

Substitute into the circle equation:

(x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2= (75√14/56)^2.

Compute each term:

(x -5)=5 -785t/77.

(y -5√14/56)= (60√14 t/77) -5√14/56=√14*(60t/77 -5/56).

Let me compute the square of each term:

First term squared: [5 -785t/77]^2=25 - 2*5*(785t)/77 + (785t/77)^2=25 - (7850t)/77 + (616,225 t²)/5,929.

Second term squared: [√14*(60t/77 -5/56)]^2=14*(60t/77 -5/56)^2.

Compute inside:

60t/77 -5/56= (480t -55)/616.

So, squared: (480t -55)^2/(616)^2.

Multiply by14:14*(480t -55)^2/(616)^2= (14*(480t -55)^2)/379,456.

Now, the equation is:

25 - (7850t)/77 + (616,225 t²)/5,929 + (14*(480t -55)^2)/379,456= (75√14/56)^2= (5625*14)/3136=78,750/3136=39,375/1568.

Multiply through by 379,456 to eliminate denominators:

25*379,456=9,486,400.

-7850t/77 *379,456= -7850t*(379,456/77)= -7850t*(4928.0)= let me compute 379,456 ÷77=4,930.56.

Wait, 77*4,930=379,410, remainder 46. So, 379,456=77*4,930 +46.

Thus, 379,456/77=4,930 +46/77=4,930 + 2/3.5.

Not helpful. Let me compute 7850t*(379,456/77)=7850t*(4,930 +46/77)=7850t*4,930 +7850t*(46/77).

Compute 7850*4,930= let's compute 7,850 *4,930.

7,850 *4,930=7,850*(5,000 -70)=7,850*5,000 -7,850*70=39,250,000 -549,500=38,700,500.

So, first term: -7850t*(379,456/77)= -38,700,500 t - (7850t*46)/77.

Compute (7850*46)/77=7850/77=102.0... 77*102=7,854, which is 4 more than 7850. So, 7850=77*102 -4.

Thus, 7850*46= (77*102 -4)*46=77*102*46 -4*46=77*(4,734) -184=364, 77*4,734= let's compute 4,734*70=331,380; 4,734*7=33,138 → total 331,380+33,138=364,518. Then subtract 184:364,518 -184=364,334.

Thus, (7850*46)/77=364,334/77=4,732.97.

So, second term: -4,732.97t.

Thus, the second term is approximately -38,700,500 t -4,733t.

Now, third term: (616,225 t²)/5,929 *379,456=616,225 t² * (379,456/5,929).

Compute 379,456 ÷5,929=64.

Because 5,929*64=379,456.

Thus, third term=616,225 t² *64=39,447,  616,225*64= let's compute 600,000*64=38,400,000; 16,225*64=1,038,400. So, total=38,400,000 +1,038,400=39,438,400 t².

Fourth term:14*(480t -55)^2=14*(230,400 t² -52,800t +3,025)=3,225,600 t² -739,200t +42,350.

So, adding all terms:

9,486,400 -38,700,500t -4,733t +39,438,400t² +3,225,600t² -739,200t +42,350=39,375/1568 *379,456.

Compute RHS:39,375/1568 *379,456=39,375*(379,456/1568)=39,375*242.714≈39,375*242.714= let me compute 39,375*242=39,375*(200 +40 +2)=7,875,000 +1,575,000 +78,750=9,528,750.

But exact computation:

379,456 ÷1568=379,456 ÷(1568)= let me compute 1568*242= 1568*(200 +40 +2)=313,600 +62,720 +3,136=313,600+62,720=376,320 +3,136=379,456.

Wow, so 1568*242=379,456.

Thus, RHS=39,375 *242= compute 39,375*200=7,875,000; 39,375*40=1,575,000; 39,375*2=78,750. Total=7,875,000 +1,575,000=9,450,000 +78,750=9,528,750.

So, equation becomes:

9,486,400 -38,700,500t -4,733t +39,438,400t² +3,225,600t² -739,200t +42,350=9,528,750.

Combine like terms:

t² terms:39,438,400 +3,225,600=42,664,000.

t terms:-38,700,500 -4,733 -739,200= -38,700,500 -739,200= -39,439,700 -4,733= -39,444,433.

Constants:9,486,400 +42,350=9,528,750.

Thus, equation:

42,664,000 t² -39,444,433 t +9,528,750=9,528,750.

Subtract 9,528,750 from both sides:

42,664,000 t² -39,444,433 t=0.

Factor t:

t*(42,664,000 t -39,444,433)=0.

Thus, solutions t=0 and t=39,444,433 /42,664,000≈0.9245.

So, t=0 corresponds to point A, and t≈0.9245 corresponds to point P.

Thus, the parameter t for point P is approximately0.9245.

Thus, AP is the distance from A to P along AD. Since t=0 is A, and t=0.9245 is P, and DA is from D(t=1) to A(t=0), the length AP is the distance from A to P, which is |t_P -0| * |AD|.

Wait, no. The parameter t is from D to A. So, t=0 is D, t=1 is A. Wait, no, earlier, I set t=0 at A and t=1 at D.

Wait, in our parametrization earlier, x=10 - (785/77)t.

At t=0, x=10, which is point A.

At t=1, x=10 -785/77=10 -10.2= -0.2, which matches point D at (-15/77, ...).

So, t=0 is A, t=1 is D.

Thus, the solution t=0.9245 is between A and D, which doesn't make sense because P is on the extension beyond D.

Wait, no, because when you solve, you have t=0 (A) and t≈0.9245.

But according to the parametrization, t=1 is D, so t=0.9245 is between A and D.

But earlier, we thought that P is beyond D, so t should be greater than1.

But the quadratic equation only gives us t=0 and t≈0.9245.

This suggests that my parametrization might be incorrect, or perhaps the line AD only intersects the circle at A and P between A and D.

But according to the Asymptote code, P is on the extension beyond D.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the parametrization.

Wait, perhaps I should parameterize from D as t=0, A as t=1, and P as t>1.

Let me try that.

Let me redefine the parametric equations with t=0 at D, t=1 at A, and t=t_P at P.

So,

x= x_D + t*(x_A -x_D)= (-15/77) + t*(10 +15/77)= (-15/77) + t*(785/77).

Similarly,

y= y_D + t*(y_A -y_D)= (60√14/77) + t*(0 -60√14/77)= (60√14/77) - t*(60√14/77).

So, parametric equations:

x= (-15/77) + (785/77)t.

y= (60√14/77)(1 -t).

Now, substitute into the circle equation:

(x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2= (75√14/56)^2.

Compute each term:

x -5= (-15/77 +785t/77) -5= (-15 +785t)/77 -5= (-15 +785t -385)/77= (785t -400)/77.

y -5√14/56= (60√14/77)(1 -t) -5√14/56=√14[60(1 -t)/77 -5/56].

Let me compute the terms inside:

60(1 -t)/77 -5/56.

Convert to common denominator 392.

60(1 -t)/77= (60*5)(1 -t)/385=300(1 -t)/385.

5/56= (5*7)/392=35/392.

So,

300(1 -t)/385 -35/392= [300(1 -t)*392 -35*385]/(38Okay, so I have this geometry problem in front of me. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the parts. 

We're given triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so first things first, let me visualize the problem. The Asymptote code isn't necessary, but knowing that ABC is inscribed in a circle helps. Points B and C have tangents that meet at D, which is the ex-pole or something? I'm not exactly sure, but I know that tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. So, DB equals DC. That's something to remember.

Then, line AD intersects the circle ω again at P. So, AP is a chord of the circle, but since D is outside the circle, AD is a secant. There's a theorem about secants and tangents—maybe the power of a point would be useful here. Let me recall: the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB squared (since DB and DC are tangents), and it's also equal to DA times DP because AD is a secant. So, I can write an equation using the power of point D.

But before that, maybe I should compute some properties of triangle ABC. Since we have all three sides, we can find the circumradius, which might help in figuring out the other lengths. Wait, let's see. Maybe if I can find the circumradius R, that could be useful later on.

So, first, let's compute the area of triangle ABC using Heron's formula. The sides are 5, 9, 10. The semi-perimeter s is (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Then, the area using Heron's formula is sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)] = sqrt[12(12 - 5)(12 - 9)(12 - 10)] = sqrt[12 * 7 * 3 * 2] = sqrt[504]. Let me compute that: 504 factors into 16 * 31.5? Wait, no. Let me factor 504. 504 divided by 2 is 252, divided by 2 is 126, divided by 2 is 63. So 2^3 * 3^2 * 7. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(2^3 * 3^2 * 7) = 2^(1.5) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 2 * sqrt(2) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 6 * sqrt(14). So the area is 6√14.

Wait, let me double-check that sqrt(504) is 6√14. 6 squared is 36, 36 times 14 is 504. Yes, that's correct.

Now, the formula for the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4*Area). So, plugging in the values: a=5, b=9, c=10. So R = (5 * 9 * 10)/(4 * 6√14) = (450)/(24√14). Simplify numerator and denominator: 450 divided by 24 is 18.75, but better to write as fractions. 450/24 = 75/4, so R = (75/4)/√14 = 75/(4√14). We can rationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(14), so R = (75√14)/(4*14) = (75√14)/56.

Wait, let me confirm the formula for the circumradius. Yes, R = (a b c)/(4 K), where K is the area. So that's correct. So R is 75√14 / 56.

Hmm, okay. So, now, what about point D? D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C. So, in triangle ABC, points B and C have their respective tangents meeting at D. Since D is the intersection of two tangents, it's the ex-pole with respect to BC, but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe it's the exsymmedian point or something else. Wait, perhaps it's the ex-pole of BC, meaning it's the center of the circle tangent to BC and the extensions of AB and AC. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps D is the ex-pole, but maybe I should approach this differently.

Given that D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, which means that BD and CD are tangents from D to ω. Therefore, by the property of tangents, DB = DC. So triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Since D is the intersection point of the two tangents, it lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC. Wait, the symmedian is the reflection of the median over the angle bisector. Alternatively, perhaps D is the symmedian point? I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps D lies on the circumcircle's polar lines or something. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can use power of a point here. The power of point D with respect to ω is DB^2 = DC^2. Also, since AD is a secant, the power of D is also equal to DA * DP. But wait, the power of D is equal to DB^2 = DA * DP. So, that gives me an equation: DB^2 = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DA, then I can find DP, and since AP = DP - DA, or wait, AP is the segment from A to P, but let me think. Actually, AD is a line from A passing through P, so AP is part of AD. If the entire length from D to P is DP, but A is on AD, so DA + AP = DP? Wait, no. Let me clarify: point A is on AD, so when we draw AD, it starts at A, goes through P, and then ends at D. So, AP is the segment from A to P inside the circle, and PD is the segment from P to D outside the circle. So, the length from D to P is DP, and from A to P is AP, and from A to D is AD. So, actually, AP * AD = DP^2? No, wait. Let me be precise.

The power of point D with respect to ω is DB^2. Since D lies outside the circle and AD is a secant that intersects the circle at A and P, the power of D is equal to DA * DP. So, DB^2 = DA * DP.

But I don't know DA or DP yet. I need to find AP, which is a part of AD. So, if I can find DA and DP, then AP would be equal to (AD * something), but I think perhaps I can express AP in terms of AD and DP.

Wait, let me write what I know:

DB^2 = DA * DP.

But AP = DP - DA. Hmm, no. Wait, AP is the segment from A to P, which is part of AD. So, AD is from A to D, passing through P. So, AD = AP + PD. So, PD = AD - AP.

Wait, but in the power of a point formula, PD is the length from P to D, which is the same as PD. So, the power formula is DB^2 = DA * DP, where DA is the length from D to A, and DP is from D to P.

Wait, no. Wait, the power of a point D with respect to a circle is equal to the product of the lengths from D to the points where a line through D intersects the circle. So, in this case, the line is AD, which intersects the circle at A and P. So, the power of D is DA * DP, where DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. But wait, since D is outside the circle, and AD passes through A and then goes into the circle, then A is closer to D than P is. So, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is from D through A to P. Wait, but that would make DP = DA + AP. Wait, no. If point A is between D and P, then DP = DA + AP. But in reality, point A is on the circle, so when you draw AD, it starts at D, goes to A, and then continues to P, which is another intersection point on the circle. So, point A is on the circle, so DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. So, if you have DA * DP = power of D.

But since A is on the circle, DA is just the tangent from D to A? Wait, no, D is the point from which two tangents are drawn to the circle at B and C. So, DA is not a tangent, but a secant.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify:

Point D is external to the circle ω, and the line AD passes through A (which is on ω) and then goes to P (another point on ω). So, the power of D is DB^2 = DA * DP.

Wait, no. Power of a point D with respect to ω is equal to DB^2 = DC^2, which is also equal to DA * DP, where DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P. But since A is on the circle, DA is the distance from D to a point on the circle, and DP is from D to another intersection point on the circle. So, the formula is correct: DB^2 = DA * DP.

But I don't know DA or DP. Hmm. So, I need another way to relate DA and DP.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the ratio AP / PD, or something like that. Because if I can find that ratio, then I can express AP in terms of AD or DP.

Wait, perhaps using Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem. Alternatively, maybe using harmonic division or inversion. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using similar triangles. Let me think.

Since BD and CD are tangents to ω, angles OBD and OCD are right angles, where O is the center of ω. So, maybe connecting O to B and C, and then triangles OBD and OCD are right-angled. But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps triangle ABC and triangle DBC have some relation. Wait, D is external, so maybe triangle DBC is similar to some other triangle.

Wait, another thought: since BD and CD are tangents, angles DBC and DCB are equal to the angles in the alternate segment. Wait, yes, that's the Alternate Segment Theorem. So, angle DBC is equal to angle BAC, and angle DCB is equal to angle BAC as well? Wait, no, let me recall.

The Alternate Segment Theorem states that the angle between the tangent and the chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. So, angle between tangent BD and chord BC is equal to the angle in the alternate segment, which would be angle BAC. Similarly, the angle between tangent CD and chord CB is equal to angle BAC as well. Wait, that makes sense.

So, angle DBC = angle BAC, and angle DCB = angle BAC. Therefore, triangle DBC has two angles equal to angle BAC, meaning it's an isoceles triangle? Wait, no, because angle DBC and angle DCB are both equal to angle BAC. So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB=DC, which we already knew.

Wait, so angle DBC = angle BAC, angle DCB = angle BAC, so triangle DBC has base angles equal to angle BAC, and vertex angle at D. So, the sum of angles in triangle DBC is angle D + 2*angle BAC = 180 degrees.

But maybe that's not directly helpful yet. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinates. Maybe I can assign coordinates to points A, B, C, compute everything, and then find AP. That might be a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.

Let me try that approach. Let me place point C at the origin (0, 0), point B at (9, 0), since BC is 9 units long. Then point A is somewhere such that AB is 5 and AC is 10. Wait, but BC is 9, so if I put C at (0,0) and B at (9,0), then A must satisfy the distances: distance from A to B is 5, distance from A to C is 10.

Let me denote point A as (x, y). Then, distance from A to C (0,0) is sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 10, so x^2 + y^2 = 100.

Distance from A to B (9,0) is sqrt( (x-9)^2 + y^2 ) = 5. So, (x-9)^2 + y^2 = 25.

Subtracting the first equation from the second: (x-9)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 25 - 100 => x^2 - 18x +81 + y^2 -x^2 - y^2 = -75 => -18x +81 = -75 => -18x = -156 => x = 156/18 = 26/3 ≈ 8.666...

Then, x = 26/3. Plugging back into x^2 + y^2 = 100:

(26/3)^2 + y^2 = 100 => (676/9) + y^2 = 100 => y^2 = 100 - 676/9 = (900/9 - 676/9) = 224/9.

So, y = sqrt(224/9) = (sqrt(224))/3 = (sqrt(16*14))/3 = (4√14)/3. So, point A is at (26/3, 4√14/3).

So, coordinates are:

C: (0, 0)

B: (9, 0)

A: (26/3, 4√14/3)

Now, I need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C. So, let's find the equations of these tangents.

First, the tangent at B. To find the tangent to the circumcircle ω at point B, I need the equation of ω.

Wait, the circumcircle passes through points A, B, C. So, let me find its equation.

Given three points: A (26/3, 4√14/3), B (9,0), C (0,0).

Let me find the circumcircle equation. The general equation of a circle is x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0.

Plugging in point C (0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 => F = 0.

So, equation becomes x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey = 0.

Plugging in point B (9,0): 81 + 0 + 9D + 0 = 0 => 9D = -81 => D = -9.

Plugging in point A (26/3, 4√14/3):

(26/3)^2 + (4√14/3)^2 + (-9)(26/3) + E*(4√14/3) = 0.

Compute each term:

(26/3)^2 = (676)/9.

(4√14/3)^2 = (16*14)/9 = 224/9.

-9*(26/3) = -78.

E*(4√14/3) is just (4√14 E)/3.

So, putting it all together:

676/9 + 224/9 - 78 + (4√14 E)/3 = 0.

Combine the fractions: (676 + 224)/9 = 900/9 = 100.

So, 100 - 78 + (4√14 E)/3 = 0 => 22 + (4√14 E)/3 = 0 => (4√14 E)/3 = -22 => E = (-22 * 3)/(4√14) = (-66)/(4√14) = (-33)/(2√14). Rationalizing, E = (-33√14)/(2*14) = (-33√14)/28.

So, the equation of the circle is x^2 + y^2 -9x + Ey = 0, where E is (-33√14)/28. So,

x^2 + y^2 -9x - (33√14/28)y = 0.

Now, the tangent at point B (9,0). The equation of the tangent to a circle at a point (x₁,y₁) is given by:

xx₁ + yy₁ + D*(x + x₁)/2 + E*(y + y₁)/2 + F = 0.

But since F=0, and D=-9, E=-33√14/28, let me write it as:

x*x₁ + y*y₁ + (-9)*(x + x₁)/2 + (-33√14/28)*(y + y₁)/2 = 0.

Wait, perhaps another formula is better. The tangent at (x₁,y₁) to the circle x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0 is:

x x₁ + y y₁ + (D/2)(x + x₁) + (E/2)(y + y₁) + F = 0.

So, for point B (9, 0), the tangent is:

x*9 + y*0 + (-9/2)(x + 9) + (-33√14/56)(y + 0) + 0 = 0.

Simplify term by term:

9x + 0 + (-9/2)(x + 9) + [(-33√14)/56] y = 0.

Expand the terms:

9x - (9/2)x - (81/2) + (-33√14 y)/56 = 0.

Combine like terms:

(9x - 4.5x) - 40.5 + (-33√14 y)/56 = 0.

4.5x - 40.5 - (33√14 y)/56 = 0.

Multiply through by 56 to eliminate denominators:

56*4.5x - 56*40.5 - 33√14 y = 0.

Compute 56*4.5: 4.5 * 56 = (9/2)*56 = 9*28 = 252.

56*40.5 = 56*(40 + 0.5) = 56*40 + 56*0.5 = 2240 + 28 = 2268.

So, equation becomes:

252x - 2268 - 33√14 y = 0.

Simplify by dividing all terms by 3:

84x - 756 - 11√14 y = 0.

Bring constants to the other side:

84x - 11√14 y = 756.

Similarly, find the equation of the tangent at point C (0,0):

Using the same tangent formula for point (x₁,y₁) = (0,0):

x*0 + y*0 + (-9/2)(x + 0) + (-33√14/56)(y + 0) + 0 = 0.

Simplify:

0 + 0 - (9/2)x - (33√14/56)y = 0.

Multiply through by 56 to eliminate denominators:

-9*28 x -33√14 y = 0.

Which is:

-252x -33√14 y = 0.

We can write this as 252x + 33√14 y = 0.

Now, we have two tangent equations:

From B: 84x - 11√14 y = 756.

From C: 252x + 33√14 y = 0.

We can solve these two equations to find point D.

Let me write them:

Equation 1: 84x -11√14 y = 756.

Equation 2: 252x +33√14 y = 0.

Let me try to eliminate y. Multiply Equation 1 by 3:

252x - 33√14 y = 2268.

Now, add Equation 2:

252x +33√14 y = 0.

Adding:

(252x + 252x) + (-33√14 y +33√14 y) = 2268 + 0.

504x = 2268.

So, x = 2268 / 504. Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 2268 ÷12=189, 504 ÷12=42.

189/42 = 4.5, which is 9/2. So, x=9/2.

Now, plug x=9/2 into Equation 2: 252*(9/2) +33√14 y =0.

Compute 252*(9/2): 252/2=126, 126*9=1134.

So, 1134 +33√14 y =0 => 33√14 y = -1134 => y = -1134/(33√14).

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 1134/3=378, 33/3=11.

So, y= -378/(11√14). Rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by √14: (-378√14)/(11*14) = (-378√14)/(154).

Simplify 378 and 154: both divisible by 14? 378 ÷14=27, 154 ÷14=11.

So, y= (-27√14)/11.

Thus, point D is at (9/2, -27√14/11).

Okay, so D is at (4.5, approximately -27*3.7417/11). But exact fractions are better.

Now, line AD connects A (26/3, 4√14/3) and D (9/2, -27√14/11). Let me find the parametric equations or the equation of line AD.

First, let me compute the vector from A to D. The change in x is 9/2 -26/3. Let me compute that:

9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6) = (-25/6).

Change in y: (-27√14/11 -4√14/3) = (-27√14/11 -4√14/3). Let me compute this:

Find a common denominator, which is 33.

Convert each term: (-27√14/11) = (-81√14)/33, and (-4√14/3) = (-44√14)/33.

So, total change in y: (-81√14 -44√14)/33 = (-125√14)/33.

So, the direction vector of AD is (-25/6, -125√14/33). Let me write this as t*(-25/6, -125√14/33), where t is a parameter.

Alternatively, we can write parametric equations for AD:

x = 26/3 + (-25/6) * t

y = 4√14/3 + (-125√14/33) * t

We can find point P where AD intersects the circle again. Since A is on the circle, P is the other intersection point.

Alternatively, since we have the equation of the circle and the parametric equations for AD, we can substitute the parametric equations into the circle equation and solve for t.

But this might be a bit involved, so let me proceed step by step.

The equation of the circle is x² + y² -9x - (33√14/28)y = 0.

Substitute x and y from the parametric equations:

x = 26/3 - (25/6) t

y = 4√14/3 - (125√14/33) t

Let me compute x²:

(26/3 - (25/6) t)^2 = (26/3)^2 - 2*(26/3)*(25/6) t + (25/6)^2 t²

Similarly, y²:

(4√14/3 - (125√14/33) t)^2 = (4√14/3)^2 - 2*(4√14/3)*(125√14/33) t + (125√14/33)^2 t²

Then, compute each term:

Compute x²:

(26/3)^2 = 676/9

-2*(26/3)*(25/6) t = -2*(650/18) t = -650/9 t

(25/6)^2 t² = 625/36 t²

Similarly, y²:

(4√14/3)^2 = 16*14/9 = 224/9

-2*(4√14/3)*(125√14/33) t = -2*(500*14 / (3*33)) t. Wait, let me compute:

First, 4√14 *125√14 = 4*125*(√14)^2 = 500*14 = 7000.

Then, denominator: 3*33 = 99.

So, the term is -2*(7000/99) t = -14000/99 t.

Then, (125√14/33)^2 t² = (15625*14)/(1089) t² = (218750)/1089 t².

So, now, putting x² + y²:

676/9 + 224/9 - 650/9 t -14000/99 t + 625/36 t² + 218750/1089 t².

Simplify:

676 + 224 = 900; so 900/9 = 100.

So, x² + y² = 100 - (650/9 +14000/99) t + [625/36 + 218750/1089] t².

Now, the other terms in the circle equation: -9x - (33√14/28)y.

Compute -9x:

-9*(26/3 -25/6 t) = -78 + (225/6) t = -78 + 75/2 t.

Compute -(33√14/28)y:

-(33√14/28)*(4√14/3 -125√14/33 t) = -(33√14/28)*(4√14/3) + (33√14/28)*(125√14/33) t.

Compute each part:

First term: -(33√14 *4√14)/(28*3) = -(33*4*14)/(28*3) = -(132*14)/(84).

Simplify:

132/84 = 11/7, so 11/7 *14 = 22. So, the first term is -22.

Second term: (33√14 *125√14)/(28*33) t = (125*14)/(28) t = (1750)/28 t = 625/11 t.

So, -(33√14/28)y = -22 + (625/11) t.

Putting it all together, the circle equation:

x² + y² -9x - (33√14/28)y = 0 becomes:

[100 - (650/9 +14000/99) t + (625/36 + 218750/1089) t²] + [ -78 +75/2 t ] + [ -22 + 625/11 t ] = 0.

Now, combine all constants, coefficients of t, and coefficients of t².

Constants: 100 -78 -22 = 0.

Coefficients of t:

-650/9 -14000/99 +75/2 +625/11.

Let me compute each term:

Convert all to a common denominator, which is 198.

-650/9 = (-650 *22)/198 = (-14300)/198.

-14000/99 = (-14000 *2)/198 = (-28000)/198.

75/2 = (75 *99)/198 = (7425)/198.

625/11 = (625*18)/198 = 11250/198.

So, adding them up:

(-14300 -28000 +7425 +11250)/198.

Compute numerator:

-14300 -28000 = -42300.

7425 +11250 = 18675.

Total: -42300 +18675 = -23625.

So, coefficient of t is -23625/198.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: -7875/66.

Again, divide by 3: -2625/22.

So, coefficient is -2625/22.

Now, coefficients of t²:

625/36 +218750/1089.

Convert to common denominator, which is 1089.

625/36 = (625*30.25)/1089. Wait, that's not helpful. Let me compute 625*1089/36: wait, maybe find 625/36 = x/1089, so x=625*(1089)/36.

But this is getting messy. Maybe compute 625/36 ≈17.3611 and 218750/1089≈200.81. Hmm, but fractions are better.

625/36 = (625 * 30.25)/1089. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, 625 * 1089 = 625*(1000 + 89) = 625,000 + 55,625 = 680,625. So, 625/36 = 680625 / (36*1089) = 680625 / 39204. Similarly, 218750/1089 is 218750/1089.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute:

625/36 + 218750/1089 = (625 * 30.25 + 218750)/1089.

Wait, 30.25 is 121/4, but that's also messy.

Alternatively, factor numerator and denominator:

625/36 = (5^4)/(6^2)

218750/1089 = (218750)/(33^2)

Not sure. Maybe compute both fractions:

625/36 ≈17.3611

218750/1089 ≈200.81

Adding them: ≈218.17. So, approximately 218.17 t².

But for exact value, let's compute:

625/36 + 218750/1089.

Find a common denominator which is 1089. So, 625/36 = (625 * 30.25)/1089? Wait, 1089 ÷36=30.25, which is 121/4. So, 625/36 = (625 * 121)/(36 * 121/4). Wait, that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, 625/36 = (625 * 30.25)/1089. But 30.25 is 121/4.

So, 625/36 = (625 * 121)/(36 * 4) * (1/1089). Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute numerically:

625 ÷36 ≈17.3611

218750 ÷1089≈200.81

So, total ≈218.17, which is 218.17/1 t². But since we have the equation:

[0] + [(-2625/22) t] + [218.17 t²] = 0.

But this is not precise. Let me try another approach.

Let me factor out t:

t [ -2625/22 + (625/36 +218750/1089) t ] =0.

But that's not helpful because both t and t² are present.

Wait, no, the equation is:

0 + (-2625/22) t + (625/36 +218750/1089) t² =0.

So, let me write it as:

(625/36 +218750/1089) t² - (2625/22) t =0.

Factor t:

t [ (625/36 +218750/1089) t -2625/22 ] =0.

So, solutions are t=0, which corresponds to point A, and the other solution is:

(625/36 +218750/1089) t -2625/22=0.

So,

t = (2625/22) / (625/36 +218750/1089).

Let me compute the denominator:

625/36 +218750/1089.

Convert to a common denominator, which is 1089:

625/36 = (625 * 30.25)/1089. Wait, 30.25 is 121/4, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, compute each fraction:

625/36 ≈17.3611

218750/1089≈200.81

But for exact calculation, 625/36 +218750/1089:

Let me compute:

Convert 625/36 to denominator 1089: 36 *30.25=1089, so 625 *30.25=625*(121/4)= (625*121)/4=75625/4=18906.25.

So, 625/36 =18906.25/1089.

218750/1089 is just 218750/1089.

So, adding them: 18906.25 + 218750 = 237656.25.

So, denominator is 237656.25/1089.

Thus, t= (2625/22) / (237656.25/1089) = (2625/22) * (1089/237656.25).

Simplify:

First, compute 2625 *1089.

2625 * 1089: Let me compute 2625 * 1000=2,625,000; 2625 *89=234,125. So, total is 2,625,000 +234,125=2,859,125.

Denominator: 22 *237656.25=22*(237,656.25)=5,228,437.5.

So, t= 2,859,125 /5,228,437.5.

Simplify this fraction:

Multiply numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate the decimal:

Numerator: 5,718,250

Denominator:10,456,875

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 25:

Numerator: 228,730

Denominator: 418,275.

Check if they have a common factor.

228,730 ÷10=22,873, 418,275 ÷5=83,655.

Check if 22,873 and 83,655 have a common factor. Let me see:

22,873: Let me check divisibility by 7: 7*3,267=22,869 → remainder 4. Not divisible by 7.

Divisible by 13? 13*1760=22,880 → remainder -7. Not.

17? 17*1345=22,865 → 22,873-22,865=8. Not.

19? 19*1204=22,876 → 22,873-22,876=-3. Not.

23? 23*994=22,862, 22,873-22,862=11. Not.

29? 29*790=22,910, which is higher. So, probably co-prime.

So, t=228,730/418,275. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because this seems messy.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation earlier. Let me recompute t.

We had:

t = (2625/22) / (625/36 +218750/1089)

But perhaps computing the denominator as fractions:

Compute 625/36 +218750/1089:

Convert both to a common denominator of 1089.

625/36 = (625 * 30.25)/1089. Wait, 30.25 is 121/4. So,

625/36 = (625 *121)/(36*4) = (75625)/(144). Wait, 75625/144. Then, 75625/144 is approximately 525.2083.

Wait, but 36*30.25=1089, so 625/36=625/(36)=625/(36)=17.3611, which is equal to 625*30.25/1089.

Wait, I think this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should instead note that for the parametric line, t=0 corresponds to A, and t=1 corresponds to D. So, the point P is somewhere along AD, so t must be greater than 1 because D is outside the circle, and AP is the chord from A to P.

Wait, no. Since A is on the circle, and AD is a secant, then P is between A and D. So, t would be between 0 and 1. Because from A (t=0) moving towards D (t=1), P is somewhere in between. But earlier, when I solved for t, I got a positive t, but maybe I made a mistake in signs.

Wait, in the parametrization, x = 26/3 - (25/6) t.

So, as t increases, x decreases from 26/3 towards D's x-coordinate, which is 9/2=4.5. So, when t=0, x=26/3≈8.666, when t=1, x=26/3 -25/6= (52/6 -25/6)=27/6=4.5, which is correct.

Similarly, y starts at4√14/3≈5.715 and goes to -27√14/11≈-11.338 as t increases from 0 to1.

So, point P is between A and D, so t is between 0 and1.

But when I solved earlier, I got t≈0.548, which is between 0 and1. So, that seems correct.

But perhaps instead of going through all this, I can use the power of point D.

We have DB^2 = DA * DP.

We can compute DB because D is at (9/2, -27√14/11), and B is at (9,0).

Compute DB distance:

sqrt[(9 - 9/2)^2 + (0 - (-27√14/11))^2] = sqrt[(9/2)^2 + (27√14/11)^2].

Compute each term:

(9/2)^2 =81/4.

(27√14/11)^2= (729 *14)/(121)=10206/121.

So, DB^2=81/4 +10206/121.

Convert to a common denominator, 484:

81/4 = (81*121)/484=9801/484.

10206/121= (10206*4)/484=40824/484.

So, DB^2=9801/484 +40824/484=50625/484.

Thus, DB=225/22.

So, DB^2= (225/22)^2=50625/484.

Now, DA is the distance from D to A.

Point D is at (9/2, -27√14/11), and A is at (26/3,4√14/3).

Compute DA:

sqrt[(26/3 -9/2)^2 + (4√14/3 - (-27√14/11))^2].

Compute each component:

26/3 -9/2= (52/6 -27/6)=25/6.

4√14/3 +27√14/11= (44√14 +81√14)/33=125√14/33.

So, DA^2= (25/6)^2 + (125√14/33)^2.

Compute each term:

(25/6)^2=625/36.

(125√14/33)^2= (15625 *14)/1089=218750/1089.

Thus, DA^2=625/36 +218750/1089.

Convert to a common denominator, which is 1089:

625/36= (625 *30.25)/1089= (625*121/4)/1089= (75625/4)/1089=75625/(4*1089)=75625/4356.

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I should compute 625/36 as (625*30.25)/1089.

Wait, 30.25 is 121/4, so:

625/36= (625 *121)/(36 *4)=75625/144.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let me compute 625/36 +218750/1089 numerically.

625/36≈17.3611, 218750/1089≈200.81. So, DA^2≈218.17, which is approximately (√218.17≈14.77)^2.

But perhaps, let me compute DA^2 exactly:

DA^2 =625/36 +218750/1089.

Compute:

625/36 = (625 * 30.25)/1089 = (625 * 121/4)/1089 = (625*121)/(4*1089)=75625/(4*1089)=75625/4356.

Similarly, 218750/1089 remains as it is.

So, DA^2=75625/4356 +218750/1089.

Convert 218750/1089 to denominator 4356: multiply numerator and denominator by 4: 875000/4356.

So, DA^2=75625/4356 +875000/4356=950625/4356.

Simplify 950625/4356:

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 316,875 /1452.

Again by 3: 105,625 /484.

Again by 25: 4225 /19.36. Wait, that's decimal. Maybe 484 divides 105,625?

Wait, 484 *218=105,632, which is close. So 105,625=484*218 -7. Not exact. Maybe it doesn't divide cleanly. So, DA^2=105625/484.

Wait, 105625/484: sqrt(105625)=325, sqrt(484)=22, so DA=325/22.

Wait, 325^2=105,625, and 22^2=484. So, DA=325/22.

So, DA=325/22.

Therefore, DA=325/22.

Now, from the power of point D: DB^2=DA * DP.

We have DB^2=50625/484.

DA=325/22.

So, DP= DB^2 / DA = (50625/484) / (325/22) = (50625/484) * (22/325).

Simplify:

50625 ÷325 = let's see: 325*155=50,375. 50625 -50,375=250. 325*0.77≈250. So, 155.77.

But let me compute 50625 ÷325:

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 50625=25*2025; 325=25*13.

So, 50625/325=2025/13=155.769≈155.77.

Similarly, 484 ÷22=22.

So, DP= (50625/484) * (22/325)= (50625 *22)/(484 *325).

But 484=22^2, so 484=22*22.

So, DP= (50625 *22)/(22*22 *325)=50625/(22*325).

Simplify 50625 ÷325=50625 ÷325=155.769≈155.77.

But exact fraction: 50625 ÷325=50625 ÷(5*65)= (50625 ÷5) ÷65=10,125 ÷65=155.769.

Wait, 65*155=10,075. 10,125-10,075=50. So, 155 +50/65=155 +10/13=155 10/13.

So, DP=155 10/13 /22= (2025/13)/22=2025/(13*22)=2025/286.

Simplify 2025 and286:

2025 ÷13=155.769. 286 ÷11=26.

Wait, 2025=45^2= (9*5)^2= 81*25.

286=2*11*13.

No common factors.

So, DP=2025/286.

Now, AD=325/22, DP=2025/286.

We need to find AP.

Since AD is the segment from A to D, and AP is from A to P on AD, then AP= AD - PD? Wait, no.

Wait, earlier we said that DA * DP = DB^2.

But in reality, PD is the length from P to D, which is the same as DP.

Since AP is from A to P, and AD is from A to D, then PD= AD - AP.

Wait, but that's if P is between A and D.

Yes, since P is on AD and on the circle, and D is outside, then P is between A and D. So, AP + PD = AD.

So, AP = AD - PD.

But wait, no. If you have point A, then moving towards D, you pass through P. So, AP is the distance from A to P, PD is from P to D. So, AP + PD = AD.

But according to the power of point D: DB^2 = DA * DP.

So, DA * DP = DB^2.

But DA is the length from D to A, which is 325/22.

DP is the length from D to P, which is PD.

So, 325/22 * PD= (225/22)^2=50625/484.

So, PD= (50625/484)/(325/22)= (50625/484)*(22/325)= (50625 *22)/(484 *325)= (50625 *22)/(484*325).

But 484=22^2, so 484=22*22.

So, PD= (50625*22)/(22*22*325)=50625/(22*325)=50625/(7150)=2025/286.

So, PD=2025/286.

Then, since AP + PD = AD, AP= AD - PD.

AD=325/22, PD=2025/286.

Convert to same denominator:

325/22= (325 *13)/(22*13)=4225/286.

PD=2025/286.

So, AP=4225/286 -2025/286= (4225 -2025)/286=2200/286.

Simplify 2200/286:

Divide numerator and denominator by 2:1100/143.

Check if 1100 and143 have common factors. 143=11*13. 1100 ÷11=100, so 1100=11*100, 143=11*13. So, divide numerator and denominator by11: 100/13.

So, AP=100/13.

Thus, AP=100/13, which is in lowest terms since 100 and13 are coprime.

So, m=100, n=13, m +n=113.

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the circumradius \( R \) of triangle \( ABC \) using Heron's formula and the formula for the circumradius. The sides of the triangle are \( AB = 5 \), \( BC = 9 \), and \( AC = 10 \). The semi-perimeter \( s \) is:

\[
s = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12
\]

The area \( K \) of the triangle is:

\[
K = \sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)} = \sqrt{12 \times 7 \times 3 \times 2} = 6\sqrt{14}
\]

The circumradius \( R \) is then:

\[
R = \frac{ABC}{4K} = \frac{5 \times 9 \times 10}{4 \times 6\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56}
\]

Next, we use coordinate geometry to find the coordinates of points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \). By placing \( C \) at the origin and \( B \) at \( (9, 0) \), we determine the coordinates of \( A \) as \( \left( \frac{26}{3}, \frac{4\sqrt{14}}{3} \right) \).

The equations of the tangents at \( B \) and \( C \) are derived, and their intersection point \( D \) is found to be \( \left( \frac{9}{2}, -\frac{27\sqrt{14}}{11} \right) \).

Using the power of a point theorem, we calculate \( DB^2 \) and \( DA \). The distance \( DB \) is found to be \( \frac{225}{22} \), and the distance \( DA \) is calculated as \( \frac{325}{22} \).

Applying the power of point \( D \):

\[
DB^2 = DA \times DP
\]

Solving for \( DP \):

\[
DP = \frac{DB^2}{DA} = \frac{\left( \frac{225}{22} \right)^2}{\frac{325}{22}} = \frac{2025}{286}
\]

Since \( AP = AD - PD \):

\[
AP = \frac{325}{22} - \frac{2025}{286} = \frac{100}{13}
\]

Thus, \( AP = \frac{100}{13} \), and \( m + n = 100 + 13 = 113 \).

\[
\boxed{113}
\]
