Okay, let me try to figure out this tetrahedron problem. So, we're given a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and we need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance is supposed to be in the form m√n / p, and then we have to find m + n + p.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the distance from the incenter to each face) can be found using the formula:

Inradius (r) = 3 * Volume (V) / Surface Area (S)

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. For a tetrahedron, the volume is related to the inradius and the surface area. Yes, the formula is similar to the 2D case where for a triangle, the inradius is area divided by semiperimeter. In 3D, it's 3 times volume divided by the total surface area. So, r = 3V / S, where S is the sum of the areas of all four faces.

So, my plan is: first, compute the volume of the tetrahedron. Then, compute the areas of each of the four faces. Add them up to get the total surface area. Then, plug into the formula to get the inradius.

But to compute the volume, I need to know the edge lengths. Let's list the edges again:

AB = CD = sqrt(41)
AC = BD = sqrt(80)
BC = AD = sqrt(89)

Hmm. This seems symmetric. So, opposite edges are equal. That suggests that this tetrahedron is "isohedral" or maybe "edge-transitive," but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe it's a "biscribed" tetrahedron, where all edges are tangent to a sphere? But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. So, AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC. So, it's called a "equifacial" tetrahedron? Or maybe "isohedral." Wait, equifacial usually means all faces are congruent, which might not be the case here.

But regardless, since all opposite edges are equal, that might help in computing the volume.

I recall that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, there's a formula for the volume. Let me think. I think it might be based on the Cayley-Menger determinant. Yeah, Cayley-Menger determinant is a formula that gives the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths.

The formula is:

Volume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 )

Where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²  b²  c² |
| 1  a²   0   d²  e² |
| 1  b²  d²   0   f² |
| 1  c²  e²  f²   0  |

So, the determinant is a 5x5 matrix, and then we take its determinant, and then compute sqrt(|det| / 288).

So, let's assign the given edge lengths:

AB = sqrt(41) => a² = 41
AC = sqrt(80) => b² = 80
AD = sqrt(89) => c² = 89
BC = sqrt(89) => d² = 89
BD = sqrt(80) => e² = 80
CD = sqrt(41) => f² = 41

So, the Cayley-Menger matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, AB², AC², AD² = 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, AB², 0, BC², BD² = 41, 0, 89, 80

Wait, no. Wait, the positions are:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, AB², AC², AD²

Row 2: 1, AB², 0, BC², BD²

Row 3: 1, AC², BC², 0, CD²

Row 4: 1, AD², BD², CD², 0

Wait, that's correct. So, plugging in the values:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Hmm, so the determinant is a 5x5 matrix with that structure.

Calculating a 5x5 determinant by hand is going to be time-consuming, but maybe there's some symmetry we can exploit.

Looking at the matrix, I notice that Rows 2 and 3 are similar, as are Rows 1 and 4, etc. Maybe we can perform some row operations to simplify.

Alternatively, perhaps we can recognize that this tetrahedron is orthocentric or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a tetrahedron that can be embedded in a coordinate system such that the coordinates are symmetric.

Wait, maybe if I assign coordinates to the vertices such that the edges correspond to vectors that are orthogonal or something. Let me try that approach.

Let me consider placing the tetrahedron in 3D space with coordinates.

Let me try to assign coordinates to the four points such that the edge lengths correspond to the given lengths.

Let me denote the points as A, B, C, D.

Let me set point A at (0, 0, 0).

Let me set point B at (x, 0, 0), so AB is along the x-axis.

Then, point C can be at (a, b, 0) in the xy-plane, and point D can be at (c, d, e) somewhere in 3D space.

But this might get complicated, but let's try.

Given that AB = sqrt(41), so the distance between A(0,0,0) and B(x,0,0) is |x| = sqrt(41), so x = sqrt(41). So, B is at (sqrt(41), 0, 0).

Now, let me consider point C. We know AC = sqrt(80) and BC = sqrt(89).

So, AC^2 = (a)^2 + (b)^2 = 80,

BC^2 = (a - sqrt(41))^2 + (b)^2 = 89.

Subtracting AC^2 from BC^2:

[(a - sqrt(41))² + b²] - [a² + b²] = 89 - 80 => (a² - 2a sqrt(41) + 41 + b²) - a² - b² = 9 => -2a sqrt(41) +41 =9 => -2a sqrt(41)= -32 => a = (32)/(2 sqrt(41)) = 16/sqrt(41) = (16 sqrt(41))/41.

So, a = 16 sqrt(41)/41.

Then, from AC^2: a² + b² =80.

Compute a²: (256 *41)/(41²) = 256/41.

So, 256/41 + b² =80 => b²=80 - 256/41 = (3280 -256)/41 = 3024/41.

So, b = sqrt(3024/41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41).

Simplify sqrt(3024): 3024= 16*189=16*9*21=16*9*3*7. So sqrt(3024)=4*3*sqrt(21)=12 sqrt(21).

Therefore, b=12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) = (12 sqrt(881))/41? Wait, wait, no. Wait, sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) is sqrt(861)/41? Wait, that's not right. Wait, sqrt(a/b) is sqrt(ab)/b.

Wait, no. Actually, sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) = sqrt(21/41). So, b is 12 sqrt(21/41). But let's just keep it as sqrt(3024/41).

So, point C is at (16 sqrt(41)/41, sqrt(3024/41), 0).

Wait, but that's a bit messy. Maybe it's better to keep it as fractions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider other coordinates or exploit symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe I can let the coordinates be such that the centroid is at the origin, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the property that in such a symmetric tetrahedron, the volume can be found using another formula.

Wait, but maybe I should just proceed with the Cayley-Menger determinant.

So, the determinant is going to be a bit messy, but perhaps we can compute it step by step.

So, the Cayley-Menger matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

So, let's denote this matrix as M.

We can expand this determinant. But 5x5 determinant is quite involved. Maybe we can perform row or column operations to simplify.

Alternatively, noticing that the matrix is symmetric, except for the first row and column.

Wait, rows 2 and 3 have similar structures, as do rows 1 and 4. Maybe we can swap some rows or columns to make the determinant easier.

Alternatively, subtract Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4.

Wait, let's see:

Let me denote the rows as R0, R1, R2, R3, R4.

Compute R2' = R2 - R1, R3' = R3 - R1, R4' = R4 - R1.

So, R0 remains [0,1,1,1,1]

R1: [1,0,41,80,89]

R2: [1,41,0,89,80]

R3: [1,80,89,0,41]

R4: [1,89,80,41,0]

So, R2' = R2 - R1: [0,41, -41, 49, -9]

Wait, let's compute each element.

R2' = [1-1, 41-0, 0-41, 89-80, 80-89] = [0,41,-41,9,-9]

Similarly, R3' = R3 - R1: [1-1,80-0,89-41,0-80,41-89] = [0,80,48,-80,-48]

R4' = R4 - R1: [1-1,89-0,80-41,41-80,0-89] = [0,89,39,-39,-89]

So, after these operations, the matrix becomes:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2': 0,41,-41,9,-9

Row 3': 0,80,48,-80,-48

Row 4': 0,89,39,-39,-89

Now, perhaps we can expand along the first column. The first column is [0,1,0,0,0], so the only non-zero entry is in R1.

The determinant can be expanded along the first column:

det(M) = 1 * det(minor at (1,1)) - 0 + 0 - 0 + 0 = det(minor at (1,1)).

The minor at (1,1) is the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing R1 and C1:

So, the minor matrix is:

Row 0': 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 2':41,-41,9,-9

Row 3':80,48,-80,-48

Row 4':89,39,-39,-89

Wait, no. Wait, the minor after removing R1 and C1 is:

From the original matrix, the minor is:

Row 0: 1,1,1,1

Row 2:41,-41,9,-9

Row 3:80,48,-80,-48

Row 4:89,39,-39,-89

Wait, actually, the minor is the matrix without row 1 and column 1, so it's:

Row 0: 1,1,1,1

Row 1:41,-41,9,-9

Row 2:80,48,-80,-48

Row 3:89,39,-39,-89

So, let's compute this 4x4 determinant.

Let me denote this minor matrix as N.

N = [
[1, 1, 1, 1],
[41, -41, 9, -9],
[80, 48, -80, -48],
[89, 39, -39, -89]
]

Hmm, that's still a 4x4 determinant, which is a bit tedious but manageable.

Let me try to perform row operations to simplify.

Looking at the first column, which is [1,41,80,89]. Maybe I can subtract the first row from the others.

Compute R1' = R1 - 41*R0

R2' = R2 -80*R0

R3' = R3 -89*R0

So:

R0: [1,1,1,1]

R1: [41 -41*1, -41 -41*1, 9 -41*1, -9 -41*1] = [0, -82, -32, -50]

R2: [80 -80*1,48 -80*1, -80 -80*1, -48 -80*1] = [0, -32, -160, -128]

R3: [89 -89*1,39 -89*1, -39 -89*1, -89 -89*1] = [0, -50, -128, -178]

So, the matrix becomes:

Row 0: 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 0, -82, -32, -50

Row 2: 0, -32, -160, -128

Row 3: 0, -50, -128, -178

Now, the determinant remains the same because we performed row operations that don't change the determinant (except for row subtractions, which don't change it). Wait, no, actually, the determinant can change if you multiply rows, but here we are just subtracting multiples of rows, which doesn't change the determinant. So, the minor's determinant is preserved.

Now, let's compute this 4x4 determinant. Since the first column has 1 followed by zeros, we can expand along the first column.

The determinant is 1 * det(minor at (0,0)).

The minor at (0,0) is the 3x3 matrix:

[
[-82, -32, -50],
[-32, -160, -128],
[-50, -128, -178]
]

So, we need to compute the determinant of this 3x3 matrix.

Let me denote this as matrix P:

P = [
[-82, -32, -50],
[-32, -160, -128],
[-50, -128, -178]
]

Compute det(P):

= -82 * det( [ [-160, -128], [-128, -178] ] )
- (-32) * det( [ [-32, -128], [-50, -178] ] )
+ (-50) * det( [ [-32, -160], [-50, -128] ] )

Compute each minor:

First term: -82 * [ (-160)(-178) - (-128)(-128) ] 

= -82 * [ (28480) - (16384) ]

= -82 * (12096)

Second term: +32 * [ (-32)(-178) - (-128)(-50) ]

= 32 * [ 5696 - 6400 ]

= 32 * (-704)

Third term: -50 * [ (-32)(-128) - (-160)(-50) ]

= -50 * [ 4096 - 8000 ]

= -50 * (-3904)

So, compute each part:

First term: -82 * 12096

Compute 82 * 12096:

12096 * 80 = 967,680

12096 * 2 = 24,192

Total: 967,680 +24,192= 991,872

So, first term: -991,872

Second term: 32 * (-704) = -22,528

Third term: -50*(-3904) = 195,200

Now, add them all together:

-991,872 - 22,528 + 195,200

First, -991,872 -22,528 = -1,014,400

Then, -1,014,400 +195,200 = -819,200

So, det(P) = -819,200

Therefore, the determinant of the minor N is 1 * (-819,200) = -819,200

Wait, no, the minor N's determinant is 1*(-819,200), but remember that det(M) is equal to det(N), because we had expanded along the first column, which only had 1 in the first row, so det(M) = det(N) = -819,200.

Wait, no. Wait, earlier, the determinant of the Cayley-Menger determinant is related to the volume. So, the determinant CM = determinant of the 5x5 matrix, which we have computed as |CM| = | -819,200 | (since det(N) = -819,200, and the overall det(M) is the same as det(N), which is -819,200). But wait, no.

Wait, let me recap:

The determinant of the 5x5 Cayley-Menger matrix M is equal to det(M) = det(N), where N is the minor after expansion. Wait, no.

Wait, in the expansion, det(M) was equal to det(N), where N was the 4x4 minor. But det(N) was computed as -819,200, so det(M) = -819,200.

But the formula for the volume is sqrt( |det(M)| / 288 ). So, take the absolute value.

So, |det(M)| = 819,200.

Thus, Volume = sqrt(819200 / 288 )

Simplify 819200 /288.

Let me compute 819200 ÷ 288.

Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 51200 / 18.

51200 ÷ 18 = 2844.444... Hmm, maybe factor further.

Wait, 819200 = 8192 * 100 = (2^13) * (2^2 *5^2)) = 2^15 *5^2.

Wait, 819200 = 8192 * 100 = (2^13) * (2^2 * 5^2) ) = 2^15 * 5^2.

288 = 16 * 18 = 2^4 * (2*3^2) ) = 2^5 * 3^2.

So, 819200 /288 = (2^15 *5^2) / (2^5 *3^2) )= 2^(10) *5^2 /3^2= 1024 *25 /9= 25600 /9.

So, Volume = sqrt(25600 /9 )= sqrt(25600)/sqrt(9)= 160 /3.

So, the volume is 160/3.

Wait, that seems a bit too clean. Let me confirm.

Wait, 819200 divided by 288:

Compute 819200 ÷ 288:

Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 51200 ÷ 18

51200 ÷ 18 = (51200 ÷ 2) ÷9 = 25600 ÷9 ≈2844.444...

But 25600 /9 is indeed 2844.444..., but 25600 /9 under square root is sqrt(25600/9) = 160/3, which is about 53.333...

Yes, so Volume V = 160/3.

Okay, so Volume is 160/3.

Next, compute the total surface area S, which is the sum of the areas of all four triangular faces.

Each face is a triangle. Since the edge lengths are given, we can compute each face's area using Heron's formula.

But first, let's note that the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, so the faces are congruent in pairs.

Wait, let me check the edge lengths:

Each face is a triangle:

Faces:

ABC: edges AB=√41, AC=√80, BC=√89

ABD: edges AB=√41, AD=√89, BD=√80

ACD: edges AC=√80, AD=√89, CD=√41

BCD: edges BC=√89, BD=√80, CD=√41

So, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89).

Wait, that's interesting. So, all four faces are congruent triangles.

Because each face has the same edge lengths: sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89).

Therefore, all four faces have the same area.

So, if we compute the area of one face, multiply by four to get the total surface area.

So, let's compute the area of triangle ABC.

Using Heron's formula: area = sqrt( s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) )

where s = (a + b + c)/2.

So, a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).

Compute s:

s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2

But this looks messy. Maybe we can compute s^2 and other terms to simplify.

Alternatively, since all faces are congruent, maybe we can find the area using another formula, like using vectors or coordinates.

Wait, considering that all faces are congruent triangles, and all have sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, the area can be computed once and multiplied by four.

Let me compute the area of triangle with sides a, b, c.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula:

Area = (1/4) sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )

But it's the same as Heron's formula.

Alternatively, maybe using vectors. Let me think.

Since we have coordinates for A, B, C, maybe we can compute the area of triangle ABC.

Wait, earlier, we placed points as:

A: (0, 0, 0)

B: (sqrt(41), 0, 0)

C: (16 sqrt(41)/41, sqrt(3024/41), 0 )

Wait, but this might get messy, but let's try.

Compute vectors AB and AC.

Vector AB = B - A = (sqrt(41), 0, 0)

Vector AC = C - A = (16 sqrt(41)/41, sqrt(3024/41), 0 )

Wait, but the area is (1/2) |AB × AC|.

Compute the cross product:

AB × AC = |i    j          k        |
           |sqrt(41)  0          0      |
           |16√41/41 sqrt(3024/41) 0 |

= i*(0*0 - 0*sqrt(3024/41)) - j*(sqrt(41)*0 - 0*(16√41/41)) + k*(sqrt(41)*sqrt(3024/41) - 0*(16√41/41))

Simplify:

= i*0 - j*0 + k*(sqrt(41 * 3024 /41)) )

= k*sqrt(3024)

So, |AB × AC| = sqrt(3024)

Therefore, area = (1/2) * sqrt(3024)

Simplify sqrt(3024):

3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 *7

sqrt(3024) = sqrt(16 *9 *21) )= 4 *3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21)

So, area = (1/2)*12 sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21)

So, each face has area 6 sqrt(21).

Thus, total surface area S = 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21).

Therefore, the inradius r = 3V / S = 3*(160/3) / (24 sqrt(21)) = (160) / (24 sqrt(21)).

Simplify 160/24: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 20 / 3.

So, r = (20 / 3) / sqrt(21) = (20)/(3 sqrt(21)).

Rationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):

= (20 sqrt(21)) / (3 *21) )= (20 sqrt(21)) / 63.

So, r = (20 sqrt(21))/63.

Simplify: 20 and 63 share a common factor of 1, so it's already reduced.

Thus, the distance is 20√21 /63.

Expressed as m√n /p, m=20, n=21, p=63.

Therefore, m +n +p =20 +21 +63=104.

Wait, but 20 and 63 are coprime? 20 factors are 2^2 *5, 63 is 7*3^2. Yes, they share no common factors. And 21 is 3*7, which is square-free.

So, that should be the answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that the given tetrahedron \(ABCD\) has all opposite edges equal, which suggests a high degree of symmetry. We use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume of the tetrahedron. The edge lengths are \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\).

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths \(AB = a\), \(AC = b\), \(AD = c\), \(BC = d\), \(BD = e\), and \(CD = f\) is given by:

\[
\text{det} = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & a^2 & b^2 & c^2 \\
1 & a^2 & 0 & d^2 & e^2 \\
1 & b^2 & d^2 & 0 & f^2 \\
1 & c^2 & e^2 & f^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Substituting the given edge lengths, we compute the determinant and find the volume \(V = \frac{160}{3}\).

Next, we calculate the total surface area \(S\). Since all four faces are congruent triangles with sides \(\sqrt{41}\), \(\sqrt{80}\), and \(\sqrt{89}\), we compute the area of one face using Heron's formula and multiply by four. Each face has an area of \(6\sqrt{21}\), so the total surface area is \(24\sqrt{21}\).

The inradius \(r\) is given by the formula \(r = \frac{3V}{S}\). Substituting the values, we find:

\[
r = \frac{3 \times \frac{160}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{160}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}
\]

Thus, the distance is \(\frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}\), and the sum \(m + n + p\) is \(20 + 21 + 63 = 104\).

\boxed{104}
