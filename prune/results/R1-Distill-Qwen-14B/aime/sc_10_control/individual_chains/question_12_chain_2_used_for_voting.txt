Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that two conditions are met. The first condition is that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading the grid left to right is 999. The second condition is that the sum of the three numbers formed by reading the grid top to bottom is 99. 

Let me try to break this down. The grid is 2 rows by 3 columns, which means each row will form a 3-digit number when read left to right, and each column will form a 2-digit number when read top to bottom. 

So, let me denote the grid cells as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\ \hline
d & e & f \\ \hline
\end{array}
\]

In this setup, the top row forms the number ABC, which is 100a + 10b + c. Similarly, the bottom row forms the number DEF, which is 100d + 10e + f. The sum of these two numbers needs to be 999. So, I can write the equation:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Additionally, each column forms a two-digit number. The first column is AD, which is 10a + d. The second column is BE, which is 10b + e, and the third column is CF, which is 10c + f. The sum of these three two-digit numbers needs to be 99. So, the second equation is:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Now, I have two equations:

1) 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.
2) 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Let me see if I can manipulate these equations to find some relationships between the variables. Maybe subtract equation 2 from equation 1? That might help eliminate some variables.

So, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99.

Let me compute the left side:

100a - 10a = 90a,
10b - 10b = 0,
c - 10c = -9c,
100d - d = 99d,
10e - e = 9e,
f - f = 0.

So the left side becomes:
90a -9c +99d +9e = 900 (since 999 -99 = 900).

I can factor out a 9 from all the terms on the left:

9(10a - c + 11d + e) = 900.

Divide both sides by 9:

10a - c + 11d + e = 100.

Hmm, that's interesting. Let me write this as:

10a - c + 11d + e = 100.  --> Equation 3.

Now, perhaps I can find a way to express some variables in terms of others. Let me think about the possible ranges for each variable.

Each variable (a, b, c, d, e, f) is a digit, so they can be between 0 and 9, inclusive. But wait, a and d cannot be zero because they are the first digits of the three-digit and two-digit numbers. Wait, no, actually, the top row is a 3-digit number, so a can't be zero. Similarly, the two-digit numbers in each column: the first digit (a, b, c) can't be zero because the numbers are two-digit, right? So, a, b, c must each be between 1 and 9, and d, e, f can be between 0 and 9.

Wait, no, hold on. The top row is a 3-digit number, so a must be from 1-9. The bottom row is also a 3-digit number, so d must be from 1-9. But the columns are two-digit numbers, so the first digit of each column (a, b, c) must also be from 1-9, because you can't have a two-digit number starting with zero. So, a, b, c: 1-9; d, e, f: 0-9.

So, all of a, b, c are from 1-9, and d, e, f are from 0-9.

Now, let me go back to equation 3:

10a - c + 11d + e = 100.

I need to find integer solutions for this equation with the constraints on a, c, d, e.

This equation has four variables, which is a bit complicated, but perhaps I can express some variables in terms of others. Let me rearrange the equation:

10a + 11d + e - c = 100.

Since a, c are between 1-9, and d, e between 0-9.

Let me think about possible values for a and d, since their coefficients are larger.

10a is between 10 and 90.

11d is between 0 and 99 (since d up to 9).

So, 10a + 11d can be as high as 90 + 99 = 189, but since e and c are involved, the total is 100.

Wait, but 10a + 11d is part of the equation. Let me see.

10a + 11d + e = 100 + c.

But c is between 1 and 9, so the right side is between 101 and 109.

So, 10a + 11d + e = 101 to 109.

Now, e is between 0 and 9. So, 10a + 11d must be between 101 -9 = 92 and 109 -0 = 109.

So, 92 ≤ 10a + 11d ≤ 109.

Hmm, okay. So, 10a + 11d must be in that range. Since a and d are integers from 1-9, let's see what possible pairs (a, d) can satisfy 92 ≤ 10a + 11d ≤ 109.

Let me compute 10a + 11d for various a and d.

Let me think about a from 1 to 9, and for each a, find possible d.

But perhaps it's easier to iterate through possible d first.

Since 11d contributes more per unit, maybe it's better to fix d and see what a can be.

Let me list possible d from 0 to 9 and see.

Wait, no, d is from 1-9 because it's the first digit of the bottom row's number.

Wait, no. Wait, the bottom row is a 3-digit number, so d is the first digit, so d must be from 1-9. So, d ∈ {1,2,...,9}.

So, d can be from 1 to 9.

Let me compute 11d for d=1 to 9:

d=1:11, d=2:22, d=3:33, d=4:44, d=5:55, d=6:66, d=7:77, d=8:88, d=9:99.

Now, 10a + 11d must be between 92 and 109. So, 10a must be between 92 -11d and 109 -11d.

But since 10a must be positive, let's find for each d, the possible a.

Let's go step by step.

d=1: 11*1=11.

So, 10a +11 must be between 92 and 109.

So, 10a is between 92-11=81 and 109-11=98.

Thus, 81 ≤10a ≤98.

So, a would be 9 (10*9=90) or 8 (10*8=80). Wait, 10a must be at least 81, so a must be at least 8.1, so a=9.

Thus, a=9.

So, 10a +11d = 90 +11=101.

Then, e = 100 +c - (10a +11d) =100 +c -101= c -1.

But e must be between 0 and 9, and c is between 1 and 9.

So, e = c -1.

Since e ≥0, c must be ≥1. Since c is at least 1, e can be from 0 to 8.

So, for d=1, a=9, e = c-1.

Now, let's consider equation 2.

Equation 2 is:

10a + d + 10b + e +10c + f =99.

We can substitute a=9, d=1.

So, 10*9 +1 +10b + e +10c +f=99.

90 +1=91, so 91 +10b +e +10c +f =99.

So, 10b + e +10c +f = 99 -91=8.

So, 10b + e +10c +f =8.

But since each term is non-negative:

10b is at least 0 (since b is a digit, 0-9, but wait, earlier I thought b must be 1-9 because it's the second digit of the top row's number. Wait, no, wait: b is in the top row, which is a 3-digit number, so a is the first digit, which is 9, so b can be 0-9. Wait, no, I thought earlier that a, b, c are the first digits of their respective columns, which are two-digit numbers, so b must be from 1-9. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the problem statement, the grid is 2x3, so each column is two-digit. So, the first digit of each column is a, b, c, which must be from 1-9 because they're the first digit of a two-digit number. Therefore, a, b, c are each in 1-9.

But in our substitution for equation 2, with a=9, d=1, and e = c-1, let's proceed.

So, 10b + e +10c +f =8.

But since b, c are at least 1, 10b +10c is at least 10*(1) +10*(1)=20. So, 20 + e +f =8.

Wait, that's not possible because 20 + e +f would be at least 20, which is way larger than 8. So, this is a contradiction. Therefore, d=1 is not possible? Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, did I make a mistake? Let me check.

Wait, equation 3 is 10a - c +11d + e =100.

For d=1, a=9, so 90 -c +11 +e =100 → 90 -c +11 +e =100 → 101 -c +e=100 → e = c -1.

Then, equation 2: 10a +d +10b +e +10c +f=99.

Substituting a=9, d=1, e=c-1: 90 +1 +10b + (c-1) +10c +f=99.

That's 90 +1=91; 91 +10b +c-1 +10c +f.

Which is 91 +10b +11c +f =99.

So, 10b +11c +f =8.

Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake in my earlier substitution. I had thought it was 10b +e +10c +f=8, but actually, it's 10b +e +10c +f=8? Let me recheck.

Wait, no, equation 2 is:

10a + d +10b + e +10c +f =99.

So, substituting a=9, d=1, e=c-1:

10*9 +1 +10b + (c-1) +10c +f =99.

Which is 90 +1 +10b +c -1 +10c +f.

Simplify: 90+1=91, then 91 +10b +c -1 +10c +f.

Which is 91 -1 =90, plus 10b +11c +f.

So, 90 +10b +11c +f=99.

So, 10b +11c +f=9.

But since b and c are at least 1, 10b is at least 10, 11c is at least 11. So, 10+11=21, which is larger than 9. So, no solution here. Therefore, d=1 is impossible.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, maybe d cannot be 1. Let's try d=2.

d=2: 11*2=22.

So, 10a +22 must be between 92 and 109.

So, 10a +22 ≥92 → 10a ≥70 → a≥7.

10a +22 ≤109 → 10a ≤87 → a ≤8.7, so a ≤8.

So, a can be 7 or 8.

Let's check a=7.

10a=70. So, 70 +22=92. Then, e =100 +c - (10a +11d) =100 +c -92= c +8.

But e must be ≤9, since it's a digit. So, c +8 ≤9 → c ≤1. But c is at least 1, so c=1. Then, e=1+8=9.

So, e=9, c=1.

Now, equation 2: 10a +d +10b +e +10c +f=99.

Substituting a=7, d=2, e=9, c=1:

10*7=70, d=2, so 70+2=72.

10b is 10b, e=9, 10c=10*1=10, so 72 +10b +9 +10 +f =99.

Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, equation 2 is 10a +d +10b +e +10c +f =99.

So, 70 +2 +10b +9 +10*1 +f =99.

Compute the constants: 70+2=72; 72+9=81; 81+10=91.

So, 91 +10b +f =99.

Thus, 10b +f=8.

But b and f are digits, with b≥1 (since it's a column digit). So, 10b ≥10, which makes 10b +f ≥10, but 8 is less than 10. So, no solution here.

So, a=7 and d=2 is impossible.

Next, a=8, d=2.

10a=80, 11d=22, so 80+22=102. So, e =100 +c -102= c -2.

Since e must be ≥0, c must be ≥2. And c ≤9, so c ranges from 2 to9, and e = c-2.

Now, equation 2: 10a +d +10b +e +10c +f=99.

Substituting a=8, d=2, e=c-2:

10*8 +2 +10b + (c-2) +10c +f=99.

Calculate constants:

80 +2=82; 82 -2=80.

So, 80 +10b +c -2 +10c +f=99.

Wait, wait, let me write correctly:

10*8=80, d=2, e=c-2, 10c, f.

So, 80 +2 +10b + (c-2) +10c +f=99.

Combine like terms:

80 +2=82. 82 -2=80.

10b + (c +10c)=11c.

So, 80 +10b +11c +f=99.

Thus, 10b +11c +f=19.

Now, since b and c are digits (b:1-9, c:2-9), and f is 0-9.

We need 10b +11c +f=19.

But 10b is at least 10, 11c is at least 22 (since c≥2). So, 10b +11c is at least 10 +22=32, which is way larger than 19. So, no solution here either.

Therefore, d=2 is also impossible.

Hmm, so moving on to d=3.

d=3: 11*3=33.

So, 10a +33 must be between 92 and 109.

So, 10a +33 ≥92 → 10a ≥59 → a≥5.9, so a≥6.

10a +33 ≤109 → 10a ≤76 → a ≤7.6, so a can be 6 or7.

Let me check a=6 first.

10a=60, so 60 +33=93. Then, e=100 +c -93= c+7.

But e must be ≤9, so c+7 ≤9 → c ≤2. c is at least 1, so c=1 or 2.

Case 1: c=1, e=8.

Case 2: c=2, e=9.

Now, equation 2: 10a +d +10b +e +10c +f=99.

Substituting a=6, d=3, e= c+7, c=1 or 2.

First, c=1, e=8.

Equation 2: 10*6 +3 +10b +8 +10*1 +f=99.

Compute:

60 +3=63; 63+8=71; 71 +10=81.

So, 81 +10b +f=99.

Thus, 10b +f=18.

But b is 1-9, f is 0-9.

Looking for 10b +f=18.

Possible solutions: b=1, f=8; b=0, f=18 (but f can't be 18, and b can't be 0 because it's a column digit). So, only b=1, f=8 is possible.

So, that's one solution: b=1, f=8.

So, in this case, the grid is:

a=6, b=1, c=1,

d=3, e=8, f=8.

Wait, but e=8, which is okay because it's a digit. f=8, also okay.

So, that's one valid arrangement.

Now, let's check the other case for a=6, d=3, c=2, e=9.

Equation 2: 10*6 +3 +10b +9 +10*2 +f=99.

Compute:

60+3=63; 63+9=72; 72 +20=92.

So, 92 +10b +f=99.

Thus, 10b +f=7.

But b is ≥1, so 10b ≥10, which would require f=7-10b, which is negative. So, no solution here.

Thus, only c=1 gives a valid solution for a=6, d=3.

Now, let's check a=7, d=3.

10a=70, 11d=33, so 70+33=103.

e=100 +c -103= c -3.

Since e must be ≥0, c≥3. And c ≤9.

So, c=3,4,5,6,7,8,9, with e=0,1,2,3,4,5,6 respectively.

Now, equation 2: 10a +d +10b +e +10c +f=99.

Substituting a=7, d=3, e=c-3.

So, 70 +3 +10b + (c-3) +10c +f=99.

Simplify:

70+3=73; 73-3=70.

So, 70 +10b +11c +f=99.

Thus, 10b +11c +f=29.

We need 10b +11c +f=29, where b is 1-9, c is 3-9, f is 0-9.

Let me find possible c values:

Since 11c ≤29 → c ≤2.63, but c must be ≥3, so no solution here.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, 11c is part of 10b +11c +f=29.

So, 11c can be at most 29. So, c can be 0,1,2. But in this case, c must be ≥3 (because e=c-3 ≥0). So, 11c ≥33, which is greater than 29. So, this is impossible. Hence, no solution for a=7, d=3.

Thus, only a=6, d=3, c=1, e=8 gives a solution.

So, now, moving on to d=4.

d=4: 11*4=44.

So, 10a +44 must be between 92 and 109.

So, 10a ≥92 -44=48 → a≥4.8 → a≥5.

10a ≤109-44=65 → a≤6.5 → a=5 or6.

Let's check a=5 first.

a=5: 10a=50, 50+44=94. So, e=100 +c -94= c+6.

e must be ≤9, so c+6 ≤9 → c ≤3. c is ≥1, so c=1,2,3.

Thus, c=1 → e=7; c=2 → e=8; c=3 → e=9.

Now, equation 2: 10a +d +10b +e +10c +f=99.

Substituting a=5, d=4, e=c+6.

So, 50 +4 +10b + (c+6) +10c +f=99.

Compute:

50+4=54; 54+6=60.

So, 60 +10b +11c +f=99.

Thus, 10b +11c +f=39.

Looking for 10b +11c +f=39, where b:1-9, c:1,2,3, f:0-9.

Let's take each c:

Case 1: c=1, e=7.

So, 10b +11*1 +f=39 → 10b +f=28.

Possible b and f:

10b can be 10,20,30.

But 10b ≤28 → b can be 2 (10*2=20), then f=8.

b=2, f=8.

Or, b=1, 10*1=10, f=18 → invalid.

b=3, 10*3=30, f= -2 → invalid.

So, only b=2, f=8.

Thus, when a=5, d=4, c=1, e=7, b=2, f=8.

So, that's a valid solution.

Case 2: c=2, e=8.

So, 10b +11*2 +f=39 → 10b +f=39-22=17.

Looking for 10b +f=17.

Possible b=1, f=7; b=0, f=17 (invalid).

So, only b=1, f=7.

Thus, a=5, d=4, c=2, e=8, b=1, f=7.

Valid solution.

Case3: c=3, e=9.

So, 10b +11*3 +f=39 →10b +f=39-33=6.

Looking for 10b +f=6.

Possible only if b=0, f=6. But b cannot be 0 because it's a column digit, which must be ≥1. So, no solution here.

Thus, for a=5, d=4, we have two solutions: c=1 with b=2, f=8; and c=2 with b=1, f=7.

Now, check a=6, d=4.

10a=60, 11d=44. So, 60+44=104.

e=100 +c -104= c-4.

So, e= c-4.

Since e ≥0, c≥4. c can be 4 to9, e=0 to5.

Equation 2: 10a +d +10b +e +10c +f=99.

Substituting a=6, d=4, e=c-4.

So, 60 +4 +10b + (c-4) +10c +f=99.

Compute:

60+4=64; 64-4=60.

So, 60 +10b +11c +f=99.

Thus, 10b +11c +f=39.

Same as before.

Now, c can be 4,5,6,7,8,9.

So, let's see.

c=4: e=0.

10b +11*4 +f=39 → 10b +f=39-44= -5. Impossible.

c=5: e=1.

10b +11*5 +f=39 →10b +f=39-55= -16. Impossible.

Similarly, c=6: 10b +f=39-66= -27.

This is impossible. So, no solutions for a=6, d=4.

Thus, only a=5, d=4 gives two solutions.

Proceeding to d=5.

d=5: 11*5=55.

So, 10a +55 must be between 92 and 109.

So, 10a ≥92-55=37 → a≥3.7 → a≥4.

10a ≤109-55=54 → a ≤5.4 → a=4 or5.

Let's check a=4.

10a=40, 40+55=95.

e=100 +c -95= c+5.

e must be ≤9, so c+5 ≤9 → c ≤4. c ≥1.

So, c=1→ e=6; c=2→e=7; c=3→e=8; c=4→e=9.

Equation 2: 10a +d +10b +e +10c +f=99.

Substituting a=4, d=5, e=c+5.

So, 40 +5 +10b + (c+5) +10c +f=99.

Compute:

40+5=45; 45+5=50.

So, 50 +10b +11c +f=99.

Thus, 10b +11c +f=49.

Now, b:1-9, c:1-4, f:0-9.

Looking for 10b +11c +f=49.

Let's check each c:

c=1: 11*1=11. So, 10b +11 +f=49 →10b +f=38.

Possible b=3, f=8 (10*3=30, 38-30=8).

b=4, f= -2 → invalid.

So, b=3, f=8.

c=1, e=6.

Thus, a=4, d=5, c=1, e=6, b=3, f=8.

Valid solution.

c=2: 11*2=22.

10b +22 +f=49 → 10b +f=27.

Possible solutions: b=2, f=7; b=1, f=17 (invalid).

So, b=2, f=7.

Thus, a=4, d=5, c=2, e=7, b=2, f=7.

Valid solution.

c=3: 11*3=33.

10b +33 +f=49 →10b +f=16.

Possible b=1, f=6; b=0, f=16 (invalid).

So, b=1, f=6.

Thus, a=4, d=5, c=3, e=8, b=1, f=6.

Valid solution.

c=4: 11*4=44.

10b +44 +f=49 →10b +f=5.

Possible only b=0, f=5 (invalid since b≥1). No solution.

So, for a=4, d=5, we have three solutions: c=1,2,3.

Now, check a=5, d=5.

10a=50, 11d=55. 50+55=105.

e=100 +c -105= c-5.

Thus, e≥0 → c≥5. c can be 5-9, e=0-4.

Equation 2: 10a +d +10b +e +10c +f=99.

Substituting a=5, d=5, e=c-5.

So, 50 +5 +10b + (c-5) +10c +f=99.

Compute:

50+5=55; 55-5=50.

So, 50 +10b +11c +f=99.

Thus, 10b +11c +f=49.

Same as before.

c can be 5,6,7,8,9.

Let's see:

c=5: e=0.

10b +11*5 +f=49 →10b +f=49-55= -6 → impossible.

c=6: e=1.

10b +66 +f=49 →10b +f= -17 → impossible.

Similarly, higher c's will make it worse.

So, no solutions for a=5, d=5.

Thus, only a=4, d=5 gives three solutions.

Next, d=6.

d=6: 11*6=66.

10a +66 must be between 92 and 109.

So, 10a ≥92-66=26 → a≥2.6 → a≥3.

10a ≤109-66=43 → a≤4.3 → a=3 or4.

Check a=3.

10a=30, 30+66=96.

e=100 +c -96= c+4.

e must be ≤9 → c+4 ≤9 → c ≤5. c≥1, so c=1,2,3,4,5.

Thus, c=1→e=5; c=2→e=6; c=3→e=7; c=4→e=8; c=5→e=9.

Now, equation 2: 10a +d +10b +e +10c +f=99.

Substituting a=3, d=6, e=c+4.

So, 30 +6 +10b + (c+4) +10c +f=99.

Compute:

30+6=36; 36+4=40.

So, 40 +10b +11c +f=99.

Thus, 10b +11c +f=59.

Looking for 10b +11c +f=59, with b:1-9, c:1-5, f:0-9.

Let's check each c:

c=1: 11*1=11.

10b +11 +f=59 →10b +f=48.

Possible b=4, f=8 →10*4=40, 48-40=8.

b=5, f= -2→invalid.

So, only b=4, f=8.

Thus, a=3, d=6, c=1, e=5, b=4, f=8.

Valid solution.

c=2: 11*2=22.

10b +22 +f=59 →10b +f=37.

Possible b=3, f=7→10*3=30, 37-30=7.

b=4, f= -3→ invalid.

So, only b=3, f=7.

Thus, a=3, d=6, c=2, e=6, b=3, f=7.

Valid solution.

c=3: 11*3=33.

10b +33 +f=59 →10b +f=26.

Possible b=2, f=6→10*2=20, 26-20=6.

So, b=2, f=6.

Thus, a=3, d=6, c=3, e=7, b=2, f=6.

Valid solution.

c=4: 11*4=44.

10b +44 +f=59 →10b +f=15.

Possible b=1, f=5→10*1=10, 15-10=5.

b=0, f=15→ invalid.

So, b=1, f=5.

Thus, a=3, d=6, c=4, e=8, b=1, f=5.

Valid solution.

c=5: 11*5=55.

10b +55 +f=59 →10b +f=4.

Possible only if b=0, f=4→invalid since b≥1. No solution.

Thus, for a=3, d=6, we have four solutions: c=1,2,3,4.

Now, check a=4, d=6.

10a=40, 11d=66. So, 40+66=106.

e=100 +c -106= c-6.

Thus, e≥0 →c≥6. c can be6,7,8,9. e=0,1,2,3.

Equation 2: 10a +d +10b +e +10c +f=99.

Substituting a=4, d=6, e=c-6.

So, 40 +6 +10b + (c-6) +10c +f=99.

Compute:

40+6=46; 46-6=40.

So, 40 +10b +11c +f=99.

Thus, 10b +11c +f=59.

Same as before.

c can be6,7,8,9.

Check each:

c=6: e=0.

10b +11*6 +f=59 →10b +f=59-66= -7→ impossible.

c=7: e=1.

10b +77 +f=59 →10b +f= -18→ impossible.

Similarly, higher c's make it worse. So, no solutions for a=4, d=6.

Thus, only a=3, d=6 gives four solutions.

Moving on to d=7.

d=7: 11*7=77.

10a +77 must be between 92 and 109.

So, 10a ≥92-77=15 → a≥1.5 → a≥2.

10a ≤109-77=32 → a≤3.2 → a=2 or3.

Check a=2.

10a=20, 20+77=97.

e=100 +c -97= c+3.

e must be ≤9 →c+3 ≤9 →c≤6. c≥1, so c=1,2,3,4,5,6.

Thus, c=1→e=4; c=2→e=5; c=3→e=6; c=4→e=7; c=5→e=8; c=6→e=9.

Equation 2: 10a +d +10b +e +10c +f=99.

Substituting a=2, d=7, e=c+3.

So, 20 +7 +10b + (c+3) +10c +f=99.

Compute:

20+7=27; 27+3=30.

So, 30 +10b +11c +f=99.

Thus, 10b +11c +f=69.

Looking for 10b +11c +f=69, with b:1-9, c:1-6, f:0-9.

Let's check each c:

c=1:11*1=11.

10b +11 +f=69 →10b +f=58.

Possible b=5, f=8 →10*5=50, 58-50=8.

b=6, f= -2→ invalid.

So, only b=5, f=8.

Thus, a=2, d=7, c=1, e=4, b=5, f=8.

Valid solution.

c=2:11*2=22.

10b +22 +f=69 →10b +f=47.

Possible b=4, f=7→10*4=40, 47-40=7.

b=5, f= -3→ invalid.

So, b=4, f=7.

Thus, a=2, d=7, c=2, e=5, b=4, f=7.

Valid solution.

c=3:11*3=33.

10b +33 +f=69 →10b +f=36.

Possible b=3, f=6→10*3=30, 36-30=6.

b=4, f= -4→ invalid.

So, b=3, f=6.

Thus, a=2, d=7, c=3, e=6, b=3, f=6.

Valid solution.

c=4:11*4=44.

10b +44 +f=69 →10b +f=25.

Possible b=2, f=5→10*2=20, 25-20=5.

b=1, f=15→ invalid.

So, b=2, f=5.

Thus, a=2, d=7, c=4, e=7, b=2, f=5.

Valid solution.

c=5:11*5=55.

10b +55 +f=69 →10b +f=14.

Possible b=1, f=4→10*1=10, 14-10=4.

b=0, f=14→ invalid.

So, b=1, f=4.

Thus, a=2, d=7, c=5, e=8, b=1, f=4.

Valid solution.

c=6:11*6=66.

10b +66 +f=69 →10b +f=3.

Possible only if b=0, f=3→ invalid.

Thus, c=6 no solution.

So, for a=2, d=7, we have five solutions: c=1,2,3,4,5.

Now, a=3, d=7.

10a=30, 11d=77. 30+77=107.

e=100 +c -107= c-7.

Thus, e≥0 →c≥7. c=7,8,9. e=0,1,2.

Equation 2: 10a +d +10b +e +10c +f=99.

Substituting a=3, d=7, e=c-7.

So, 30 +7 +10b + (c-7) +10c +f=99.

Compute:

30+7=37; 37-7=30.

So, 30 +10b +11c +f=99.

Thus, 10b +11c +f=69.

Same as before.

c can be7,8,9.

Check:

10b +88 +f=69 →10b +f= -19→ impossible.

c=9: e=2.

10b +99 +f=69 →10b +f= -30→ impossible.

Thus, no solutions for a=3, d=7.

Thus, only a=2, d=7 gives five solutions.

Proceeding to d=8.

d=8: 11*8=88.

10a +88 must be between92 and109.

So, 10a ≥92-88=4 → a≥0.4→a≥1. But a must be ≥1, so a can be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. But 10a +88 ≤109 →10a ≤21 →a ≤2.1. So, a=1 or2.

Check a=1.

10a=10, 10+88=98.

e=100 +c -98= c+2.

e ≤9 →c+2 ≤9→c ≤7. c≥1, so c=1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

Thus, e=3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

Equation 2: 10a +d +10b +e +10c +f=99.

Substituting a=1, d=8, e=c+2.

So, 10 +8 +10b + (c+2) +10c +f=99.

Compute:

10+8=18; 18+2=20.

So, 20 +10b +11c +f=99.

Thus, 10b +11c +f=79.

Looking for 10b +11c +f=79, with b:1-9, c:1-7, f:0-9.

Each c:

c=1:11 →10b +11 +f=79→10b +f=68.

Possible b=6, f=8→10*6=60, 68-60=8.

b=7, f= -2→ invalid.

So, b=6, f=8.

c=1, e=3.

So, a=1, d=8, c=1, e=3, b=6, f=8.

Valid solution.

c=2:22 →10b +22 +f=79→10b +f=57.

Possible b=5, f=7→10*5=50,57-50=7.

b=6, f= -3→ invalid.

So, b=5, f=7.

Thus, a=1, d=8, c=2, e=4, b=5, f=7.

Valid solution.

c=3:33 →10b +33 +f=79→10b +f=46.

Possible b=4, f=6→10*4=40,46-40=6.

b=5, f= -4→ invalid.

So, b=4, f=6.

Thus, a=1, d=8, c=3, e=5, b=4, f=6.

Valid solution.

c=4:44 →10b +44 +f=79→10b +f=35.

Possible b=3, f=5→10*3=30,35-30=5.

b=4, f= -5→ invalid.

So, b=3, f=5.

Thus, a=1, d=8, c=4, e=6, b=3, f=5.

Valid solution.

c=5:55 →10b +55 +f=79→10b +f=24.

Possible b=2, f=4→10*2=20,24-20=4.

b=1, f=14→ invalid.

So, b=2, f=4.

Thus, a=1, d=8, c=5, e=7, b=2, f=4.

Valid solution.

c=6:66 →10b +66 +f=79→10b +f=13.

Possible b=1, f=3→10*1=10,13-10=3.

b=0, f=13→ invalid.

So, b=1, f=3.

Thus, a=1, d=8, c=6, e=8, b=1, f=3.

Valid solution.

c=7:77 →10b +77 +f=79→10b +f=2.

Possible only b=0, f=2→ invalid.

Thus, c=7 no solution.

So, for a=1, d=8, we have six solutions: c=1,2,3,4,5,6.

Now, a=2, d=8.

10a=20, 11d=88. 20+88=108.

e=100 +c -108= c-8.

Thus, e≥0 →c≥8. c=8,9. e=0,1.

Equation 2: 10a +d +10b +e +10c +f=99.

Substituting a=2, d=8, e=c-8.

So, 20 +8 +10b + (c-8) +10c +f=99.

Compute:

20+8=28; 28-8=20.

So, 20 +10b +11c +f=99.

Thus, 10b +11c +f=79.

Same as before.

c can be8,9.

Check:

c=8: e=0.

10b +88 +f=79→10b +f= -9→ impossible.

c=9: e=1.

10b +99 +f=79→10b +f= -20→ impossible.

Thus, no solutions for a=2, d=8.

Thus, only a=1, d=8 gives six solutions.

Moving on to d=9.

d=9:11*9=99.

10a +99 must be between92 and109.

So, 10a ≥92-99= -7 →a≥0. But since a must be ≥1, a can be 1,2,...,9, but 10a +99 ≤109 →10a ≤10 →a≤1.

Thus, a=1.

So, a=1, d=9.

10a=10, 10+99=109.

e=100 +c -109= c-9.

Thus, e≥0 →c≥9. But c is a digit, so c=9. e=0.

Equation 2: 10a +d +10b +e +10c +f=99.

Substituting a=1, d=9, e=0 (since c=9).

So, 10 +9 +10b +0 +90 +f=99.

Compute:

10+9=19; 19+90=109.

So, 109 +10b +f=99.

Thus, 10b +f= -10→ impossible.

So, no solution for d=9.

Thus, d=9 gives no solutions.

So, now, compiling all the solutions we've found for each d:

d=1: 0 solutions.

d=2: 0 solutions.

d=3: 1 solution.

d=4: 2 solutions.

d=5:3 solutions.

d=6:4 solutions.

d=7:5 solutions.

d=8:6 solutions.

d=9:0 solutions.

Wait, let me check:

Wait, d=3: a=6, d=3: 1 solution.

d=4: a=5, two solutions.

d=5: a=4, three solutions.

d=6: a=3, four solutions.

d=7: a=2, five solutions.

d=8: a=1, six solutions.

So, total solutions would be 1+2+3+4+5+6= 21.

Wait, that totals up to 21 solutions.

Wait, but let me confirm each count:

d=3: 1 solution.

d=4: 2.

d=5:3.

d=6:4.

d=7:5.

d=8:6.

Yes, 1+2+3+4+5+6=21.

Thus, the total number of ways is 21.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of valid 2x3 grids where the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99.

We denote the grid cells as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\ \hline
d & e & f \\ \hline
\end{array}
\]

The two conditions translate to:
1. \(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\)
2. \(10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99\)

By manipulating these equations, we derive the relationship:
\[
10a - c + 11d + e = 100
\]

We analyze possible values for \(d\) (from 1 to 9) and determine corresponding values for \(a\), \(c\), \(e\), \(b\), and \(f\) while satisfying the constraints that each digit is between 0 and 9 (with \(a, b, c, d\) being at least 1).

After evaluating each possible \(d\), we find the following valid solutions:

- \(d = 3\): 1 solution
- \(d = 4\): 2 solutions
- \(d = 5\): 3 solutions
- \(d = 6\): 4 solutions
- \(d = 7\): 5 solutions
- \(d = 8\): 6 solutions

Summing these, we get a total of \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21\) valid grids.

The number of ways to fill the grid is:

\[
\boxed{21}
\]
