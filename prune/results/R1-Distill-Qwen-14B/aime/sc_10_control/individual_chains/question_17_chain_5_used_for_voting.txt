Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box in the set B. The set B consists of all rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.

Hmm, let's break it down. First, I know that a rectangular box has three dimensions: length, width, and height. Let me denote them as x, y, and z. So, the surface area S of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + xz). The volume V is given by xyz.

Given that S = 54 and V = 23, so we have two equations:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54
2. xyz = 23

I need to find the minimal sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's radius will be determined by the maximum distance from the center of the sphere to any corner of the box. Since the sphere must contain the entire box, the radius must be at least half the space diagonal of the box. So, the space diagonal D of the box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere is D/2, so r² = (D²)/4 = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, my goal is to minimize r², which is equivalent to minimizing (x² + y² + z²)/4. Therefore, I need to minimize x² + y² + z² given the constraints on the surface area and volume.

Okay, so let's define the problem: minimize f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z² subject to the constraints g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23.

This sounds like a problem of constrained optimization. I remember that for such problems, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. So, I can set up the Lagrangian function:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(2(xy + yz + xz) - 54) - μ(xyz - 23)

Then, to find the extrema, we take the partial derivatives of L with respect to x, y, z, λ, and μ, set them equal to zero, and solve the equations.

Let me compute the partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(2y + 2z) - μ(yz) = 0

Similarly,

∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(2x + 2z) - μ(xz) = 0

∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(2x + 2y) - μ(xy) = 0

And of course, the constraints:

2(xy + yz + xz) = 54
xyz = 23

So, now I have five equations:

1. 2x - 2λ(y + z) - μyz = 0
2. 2y - 2λ(x + z) - μxz = 0
3. 2z - 2λ(x + y) - μxy = 0
4. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54
5. xyz = 23

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. I notice that the first three equations are symmetric in x, y, z. Maybe this suggests that x = y = z? But wait, if x = y = z, then the box would be a cube. Let me check if that's possible.

If the box is a cube, then x = y = z = a. Then, surface area would be 6a² = 54 => a² = 9 => a = 3. Then, volume would be a³ = 27. But in the problem, the volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, a cube is not possible because the volume would have to be 27, not 23. Therefore, x, y, z cannot all be equal. So, the minimal sphere may not correspond to a cube.

So, maybe not all variables are equal, but perhaps two are equal, or maybe all are different. Let me see.

Suppose two variables are equal, say x = y. Then, maybe I can reduce the problem to two variables.

Let me try that. Let x = y, so we have:

Surface area: 2(x² + xz + xz) = 2x² + 4xz = 54
Volume: x² z = 23

So, let's write the surface area equation as 2x² + 4xz = 54. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x² + 2xz = 27. Let me denote this as equation (A).

Volume equation: x² z = 23. Let me solve equation (A) for z.

From (A): x² + 2xz = 27 => 2xz = 27 - x² => z = (27 - x²)/(2x)

Now, plug this into the volume equation: x² * z = 23

So, x² * [(27 - x²)/(2x)] = 23

Simplify:

(x²)(27 - x²) / (2x) = 23
=> x(27 - x²)/2 = 23
Multiply both sides by 2:
x(27 - x²) = 46
=> 27x - x³ = 46
=> x³ - 27x + 46 = 0

So, we have the cubic equation x³ -27x +46 = 0. Let me try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. The possible roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Let me test x=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0. 8-54 is -46, plus 46 is 0. So x=2 is a root.

So, (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23) = 0. So, the other roots are solutions to x² + 2x -23 = 0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

Since x is a length, it must be positive. So, the roots are x=2, x= -1 + 2√6 (approx 3.916), and x= -1 - 2√6 (negative, so discard).

So, possible x values: 2 and -1 + 2√6.

Let me check x=2 first.

If x=2, then from equation for z: z = (27 - (2)^2)/(2*2) = (27 -4)/4 = 23/4 = 5.75

So, x=2, y=2, z=23/4.

Compute the space diagonal squared: x² + y² + z² = 4 + 4 + (23/4)^2 = 8 + (529/16) = (128 + 529)/16 = 657/16. So, r² is 657/(16*4) = 657/64? Wait, wait, no. No, wait, the radius is half the space diagonal. So, D = sqrt(x² + y² + z²), r = D/2, so r² = D²/4 = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, x² + y² + z² for x=2, y=2, z=23/4 is 4 + 4 + (529/16) = (64 + 64 + 529)/16 = (128 + 529)/16 = 657/16. So, r² is (657/16)/4 = 657/64.

But 657 divided by 64 is equal to approximately 10.265625. Hmm, not sure if that's the minimal.

Wait, the other possible x is -1 + 2√6, which is roughly 3.916.

Let me compute that x. x = -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 + 4.898 ≈ 3.898.

Then, z = (27 - x²)/(2x). Let me compute x²:

x ≈ 3.898, so x² ≈ (3.898)^2 ≈ 15.193.

So, 27 - x² ≈ 27 - 15.193 ≈ 11.807.

Then, z ≈ 11.807 / (2*3.898) ≈ 11.807 / 7.796 ≈ 1.513.

So, now, x ≈3.898, y=3.898, z≈1.513.

Compute x² + y² + z² ≈ (15.193) + (15.193) + (2.289) ≈ 32.675.

So, r² ≈32.675/4 ≈8.16875.

Wait, that's a smaller value than when x=2, which was approximately 10.2656.

So, this suggests that when x=y≈3.898, z≈1.513, we get a smaller r².

But wait, is this the minimal? Or could there be a configuration where x, y, z are all different, leading to an even smaller r²?

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, but perhaps not necessarily x=y. Maybe another pair?

Wait, but let's see. Since the problem is symmetric in x, y, z, the minimal should occur when x=y or y=z or x=z. So, in the problem, without loss of generality, we can assume x=y, as I did.

But, let me check the case when x=y, and see if the minimal occurs at the x=2 case or the other x≈3.898 case.

Wait, when x=2, the space diagonal squared is 657/16, so r² is 657/64 ≈10.2656.

When x≈3.898, r²≈8.16875, which is smaller, so the minimal must be at the other root.

Thus, perhaps the minimal occurs at x = -1 + 2√6.

But wait, let me compute it exactly rather than approximately.

Let me compute x = -1 + 2√6.

Compute x²:

x = (-1 + 2√6)^2 = 1 -4√6 + (2√6)^2 = 1 -4√6 + 24 = 25 -4√6.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b².

So, (-1 + 2√6)^2 = (-1)^2 + (2√6)^2 + 2*(-1)*(2√6) = 1 + 24 + (-4√6) = 25 -4√6.

Yes, that's correct.

So, x² = 25 -4√6.

Then, z = (27 - x²)/(2x) = (27 - (25 -4√6))/(2*(-1 + 2√6)) = (2 +4√6)/(2*(-1 + 2√6)).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2 +4√6 = 2(1 + 2√6)

Denominator: 2*(-1 + 2√6) = 2*(-1 + 2√6)

So, z = [2(1 + 2√6)]/[2*(-1 + 2√6)] = (1 + 2√6)/(-1 + 2√6).

Multiply numerator and denominator by (-1 - 2√6) to rationalize:

z = [ (1 + 2√6)(-1 - 2√6) ] / [ (-1 + 2√6)(-1 - 2√6) ]

Compute denominator: (-1)^2 - (2√6)^2 = 1 - 24 = -23.

Compute numerator:

(1)(-1) + (1)(-2√6) + (2√6)(-1) + (2√6)(-2√6)

= -1 -2√6 -2√6 - 24

= (-1 -24) + (-2√6 -2√6)

= -25 -4√6

So, z = (-25 -4√6)/(-23) = (25 +4√6)/23.

So, z = (25 +4√6)/23.

So, now, let me compute x² + y² + z².

Since x = y = (-1 + 2√6), x² = y² =25 -4√6.

So, x² + y² = 2*(25 -4√6) =50 -8√6.

Then, z² = [(25 +4√6)/23]^2.

Compute numerator: (25)^2 + 2*25*4√6 + (4√6)^2 = 625 + 200√6 + 16*6 =625 + 200√6 +96=721 +200√6.

So, z² = (721 +200√6)/(23^2)= (721 +200√6)/529.

So, x² + y² + z² = (50 -8√6) + (721 +200√6)/529.

Let me write all terms over 529:

50 = 50 * 529 /529 = 26450/529

-8√6 = (-8√6)*529/529 = (-4232√6)/529

So, total:

(26450 -4232√6 +721 +200√6)/529

Combine like terms:

26450 +721 =27171

-4232√6 +200√6 = (-4232 +200)√6 = (-4032)√6

Thus, x² + y² + z² = (27171 -4032√6)/529.

So, r^2 = (x² + y² + z²)/4 = (27171 -4032√6)/(4*529) = (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute x² + y² + z² exactly.

Wait, x = y = (-1 + 2√6), so x² = y² = (25 -4√6) as above.

z = (25 +4√6)/23, so z² = (25 +4√6)^2 / (23)^2.

Wait, as above, z² = (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529 = (721 +200√6)/529.

So, x² + y² + z² = 2*(25 -4√6) + (721 +200√6)/529.

Compute 2*(25 -4√6): 50 -8√6.

So, 50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

To combine these, let's write 50 as 50*529/529 and -8√6 as (-8√6*529)/529.

So:

50 = 50*529/529 = 26450/529

-8√6 = (-4232√6)/529

So, adding all terms:

(26450 -4232√6 +721 +200√6)/529.

Which is (26450 +721) + (-4232√6 +200√6) = 27171 -4032√6.

So, x² + y² + z² = (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Thus, r² is (27171 -4032√6)/(4*529) = (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

Hmm, that's as simplified as it gets, but this seems messy. Maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, another approach: perhaps we can parameterize the variables using the method of Lagrange multipliers.

From the partial derivatives:

1. 2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ yz = 0
2. 2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ xz = 0
3. 2z - 2λ(x + y) - μ xy = 0

Let me subtract equation 1 and 2:

(2x -2λ(y+z) - μ yz) - (2y -2λ(x+z) - μ xz) =0

=> 2x -2y -2λ(y + z -x - z) - μ(yz - xz) =0

Simplify:

2(x - y) -2λ(y -x) - μ z(y -x)=0

Factor (x - y):

(x - y)[2 + 2λ + μ z] = 0

So, either x = y, or 2 + 2λ + μ z =0.

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 - equation3:

(2y - 2λ(x+z) - μ xz) - (2z - 2λ(x+y) - μ xy) =0

=>2y -2z -2λ(x + z -x -y) - μ xz + μ xy =0

Simplify:

2(y - z) -2λ(z - y) + μ x (y - z) =0

Factor (y - z):

(y - z)[2 + 2λ + μ x] =0

So, either y = z, or 2 + 2λ + μ x=0.

Similarly, subtracting equation 1 - equation3:

(2x -2λ(y+z) - μ yz) - (2z -2λ(x+y) - μ xy) =0

=>2x -2z -2λ(y + z -x -y) - μ yz + μ xy =0

Simplify:

2(x - z) -2λ(z -x) + μ y(x -z)=0

Factor (x - z):

(x - z)[2 + 2λ + μ y] =0

So, either x = z, or 2 + 2λ + μ y=0.

So, in summary, from the differences of the equations, either two variables are equal, or some relation involving λ and μ holds.

Assuming that x, y, z are not all equal, but perhaps two are equal.

Earlier, I assumed x=y and found the solution, which gave a lower r² than the cube case.

Alternatively, if another pair is equal, but perhaps the minimal occurs when x=y.

Wait, but in the case where x=y, we have a solution, but perhaps if another pair is equal, we might get a different result.

Alternatively, perhaps all three variables are different, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when x=y=z, but as we saw, that's impossible because the volume would have to be 27, not 23.

Thus, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, which in this case, gives us x=y and z different.

So, perhaps the minimal r² is when x=y, and z is as computed.

So, going back, I have x= -1 + 2√6, y=x, z=(25 +4√6)/23.

Then, x² + y² + z² = 2*(25 -4√6) + (25 +4√6)^2/(23)^2.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in earlier calculations. Let me recompute.

Wait, x² + y² + z² = 2x² + z².

Since x = -1 + 2√6, x² = (-1 + 2√6)^2 =1 -4√6 + 24 =25 -4√6.

So, 2x² =50 -8√6.

z = (25 +4√6)/23.

So, z² = (25 +4√6)^2/(23)^2 = (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529 = (721 +200√6)/529.

Thus, x² + y² + z² =50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

Let me compute this fraction.

Convert 50 into 50*529/529 =26450/529.

Similarly, -8√6 = (-8√6)*529/529 = (-4232√6)/529.

So, adding all together:

26450/529 -4232√6/529 +721/529 +200√6/529.

Combine like terms:

(26450 +721) =27171.

(-4232√6 +200√6)= (-4032√6).

Thus, x² + y² + z² = (27171 -4032√6)/529.

So, r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4 = (27171 -4032√6)/(4*529) = (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

Wait, but this is messy. I was expecting a rational number because the problem states that r² can be written as p/q, implying that it's a rational number. So, perhaps my initial assumption that x=y is incorrect, or perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when all variables are equal, but that's impossible because the volume is 23, not 27.

Wait, maybe I can approach this problem using AM >= GM or other inequalities.

We know that for positive numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean.

But since we have constraints on both surface area and volume, perhaps we can use some optimization techniques.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express variables in terms of each other.

Given the surface area 2(xy + yz + xz)=54, so xy + yz + xz=27.

And volume xyz=23.

We need to minimize x² + y² + z².

I recall that for positive numbers, the following inequality holds:

x² + y² + z² >= (xy + yz + xz).

But in our case, xy + yz + xz=27, so x² + y² + z² >=27.

But, is 27 achievable? That would require x=y=z, but then volume would be 27, which is more than 23. So, no, x² + y² + z² must be greater than 27.

So, the minimal x² + y² + z² is greater than 27. Our earlier case when x=y=2, z=23/4 gives x² + y² + z²=657/16≈41.0625, which is greater than 27.

The other case when x=y≈3.898 and z≈1.513 gives x² + y² + z²≈32.675, which is also greater than 27.

But perhaps the minimal occurs somewhere between these two points.

Wait, but we have to find the exact minimal. Maybe using Lagrange multipliers.

Let me try to solve the system of equations from the Lagrangian.

We have:

1. 2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ yz =0

2. 2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ xz =0

3. 2z - 2λ(x + y) - μ xy =0

4. 2(xy + yz + xz)=54

5. xyz=23

Let me assume that x, y, z are all different.

Let me denote equations 1,2,3 as:

Equation 1: 2x = 2λ(y + z) + μ yz

Equation 2: 2y = 2λ(x + z) + μ xz

Equation 3: 2z = 2λ(x + y) + μ xy

Let me try to subtract equation 1 and 2:

2x - 2y = 2λ(y + z -x - z) + μ(yz - xz)

Simplify:

2(x - y) = 2λ(y -x) + μ z(y -x)

Factor (x - y):

2(x - y) = -(2λ + μ z)(x - y)

If x ≠ y, we can divide both sides by (x - y):

2 = -(2λ + μ z)

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 - equation3:

2y -2z = 2λ(x + z -x -y) + μ(xz - xy)

Simplify:

2(y - z) = 2λ(z - y) + μ x(z - y)

Factor (y - z):

2(y - z) = -(2λ + μ x)(y - z)

If y ≠ z, then divide both sides:

2 = -(2λ + μ x)

Similarly, subtracting equation1 - equation3:

2x -2z = 2λ(y + z -x - y) + μ yz - μ xy

Simplify:

2(x - z) = 2λ(z -x) + μ z y - μ x y

Factor:

2(x - z) = -2λ(x - z) + μ y (z -x )

Factor (x - z):

2(x - z) = -(2λ + μ y)(x - z)

If x ≠ z, then divide:

2 = -(2λ + μ y)

So, from the above, we have:

2 = -(2λ + μ z)

2 = -(2λ + μ x)

2 = -(2λ + μ y)

So, this implies that:

-(2λ + μ z) = -(2λ + μ x) = -(2λ + μ y) =2

Therefore, 2λ + μ z = 2λ + μ x = 2λ + μ y = -2

Thus, μ z = μ x = μ y = -2 -2λ.

Which implies that μ (x - y) =0, μ(y - z)=0, etc.

So, either μ=0 or x=y=z.

But x=y=z is not possible because volume would be 27≠23.

So, μ=0.

From equation 1: 2x = 2λ(y + z)

Similarly, equation2: 2y=2λ(x + z)

Equation3: 2z=2λ(x + y)

So, with μ=0, we have:

From equation1: x = λ(y + z)

From equation2: y=λ(x + z)

From equation3: z=λ(x + y)

So, let's write:

x = λ(y + z) --> equation A

y = λ(x + z) --> equation B

z = λ(x + y) --> equation C

Let me subtract equation A - equation B:

x - y = λ(y + z - x - z) = λ(y -x)

So, x - y = -λ(x - y)

If x ≠ y, then:

1 = -λ

Thus, λ = -1

So, from equation A: x = -1*(y + z) => x = -y -z

But since x, y, z are lengths, they are positive, so x = -y -z would be negative, which is impossible. So, contradiction.

Therefore, x must equal y, as earlier.

So, this brings us back to the case where x=y.

Thus, the minimal must occur when x=y.

So, now, going back to the case where x=y, and solving for x and z.

Earlier, we found that x can be 2 or x= -1 +2√6.

So, the minimal occurs when x= -1 +2√6.

Thus, the minimal x² + y² + z² is (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Wait, but this is irrational, but the problem states that r² can be expressed as a fraction p/q, implying that it's rational. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming x=y.

Wait, perhaps the minimal occurs when x, y, z are all different, but the problem setup requires to consider symmetric cases.

Wait, but according to the Lagrange multipliers, the minimal occurs when x=y, because otherwise, we end up with a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal is when x, y, z are all equal, but as we saw, that's impossible.

Wait, but perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is different, but the calculation leads to an irrational number, which contradicts the problem statement.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let me re-express the problem.

We have:

Surface area: 2(xy + yz + xz)=54.

Volume: xyz=23.

We need to minimize x² + y² + z².

Let me denote S = xy + yz + xz=27.

We need to minimize x² + y² + z².

I recall that (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz).

Thus, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2S = (x + y + z)^2 -54.

So, to minimize x² + y² + z², we need to minimize (x + y + z)^2.

Thus, minimize x + y + z.

So, the problem reduces to minimizing x + y + z given that xy + yz + xz=27 and xyz=23.

Hmm, perhaps this is easier.

Let me denote t = x + y + z.

We need to minimize t^2 -54.

Given that.

We need to find the minimal t such that for positive x, y, z, with xy + yz + xz=27 and xyz=23.

Is there a known inequality that relates t, S=27, and P=23?

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the inequality between the arithmetic mean and geometric mean.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the method of substitution.

Let me assume that x ≤ y ≤ z.

But perhaps it's better to use substitution.

Let me set variables as follows: Let a = x, b = y, c = z.

We have ab + bc + ca =27, abc=23.

We need to find the minimal a + b + c.

Wait, perhaps we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers again, but this time for t = a + b + c.

But that might not be necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps express c in terms of a and b.

From abc=23, c=23/(ab).

From ab + bc + ca=27:

ab + b*(23/(ab)) + a*(23/(ab))=27.

Simplify:

ab + (23)/(a) + (23)/(b) =27.

Let me denote ab =k.

Then, the equation becomes:

k + 23/a +23/b =27.

But this might not help.

Alternatively, since c=23/(ab), we can write t =a + b + 23/(ab).

We need to minimize t.

But this is a function of a and b, which could be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps set a = b, as we did before.

Then, set a = b, so c=23/(a²).

Then, ab + bc + ca = a² + 2ac=27.

Substitute c=23/(a²):

a² + 2a*(23/a²)=27.

Simplify:

a² + 46/a=27.

Multiply both sides by a:

a³ +46=27a.

Rearranged: a³ -27a +46=0.

Which is the same cubic equation as before.

So, the minimal occurs when a=2 or a=-1 +2√6.

We saw that a=2 gives t=2+2+23/(4)= 4 +5.75=9.75.

But when a= -1 +2√6≈3.898, then c=23/(a²)=23/(25 -4√6).

Which we rationalized earlier as (25 +4√6)/23.

So, t= a + a + c= 2a + c=2*(-1 +2√6) + (25 +4√6)/23.

Compute numerically:

2a=2*(-1 +2√6)= -2 +4√6≈-2 +9.798≈7.798.

c≈1.513.

So, t≈7.798 +1.513≈9.311.

Which is lower than t=9.75.

So, the minimal t is approximately 9.311.

But we need the exact value.

So, t=2a +c=2*(-1 +2√6) + (25 +4√6)/23.

Compute this exactly:

t= -2 +4√6 + (25 +4√6)/23.

Combine terms:

t= (-2*23 +25)/23 + (4√6*23 +4√6)/23.

Compute numerator:

-46 +25 =-21.

4√6*(23 +1)=4√6*24=96√6.

So, t=(-21 +96√6)/23.

Thus, t= (96√6 -21)/23.

Therefore, t² = [(96√6 -21)/23]^2.

Compute numerator:

(96√6)^2 + (21)^2 - 2*96√6*21.

= (96² *6) +441 - 2*96*21√6.

Compute 96²=9216.

So, 9216*6=55296.

Thus, numerator=55296 +441 - 4032√6=55737 -4032√6.

Denominator:23²=529.

Thus, t²=(55737 -4032√6)/529.

But wait, x² + y² + z² = t² -54.

So, x² + y² + z²= (55737 -4032√6)/529 -54.

Convert 54 to 54*529/529=28626/529.

Thus, x² + y² + z²= (55737 -4032√6 -28626)/529 = (55737 -28626 -4032√6)/529.

Compute 55737 -28626=27111.

So, x² + y² + z²=(27111 -4032√6)/529.

Wait, earlier I had 27171 -4032√6. Close but not same. So, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, t= (96√6 -21)/23.

t²= (96√6 -21)^2 / (23)^2.

Compute numerator:

(96√6)^2= (96)^2 *6=9216 *6=55296.

(21)^2=441.

Cross term: 2*(96√6)*(-21)= -2*96*21*√6= -4032√6.

Thus, numerator=55296 +441 -4032√6=55737 -4032√6.

Thus, t²=(55737 -4032√6)/529.

So, x² + y² + z²= t² -54= (55737 -4032√6)/529 -54.

Convert 54 to 54*529/529=28626/529.

Thus, x² + y² + z²= (55737 -4032√6 -28626)/529.

Compute 55737 -28626=27111.

Thus, x² + y² + z²= (27111 -4032√6)/529.

So, r²= (x² + y² + z²)/4= (27111 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27111 -4032√6)/2116.

But this is still irrational, which contradicts the problem statement that r² is a rational number p/q.

Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the minimal occurs when all three variables are equal, but that's impossible due to volume.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, but the third is such that x² + y² + z² is rational.

But in our calculation, it's irrational.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that x=y. Maybe the minimal occurs when x, y, z are all different.

But according to the Lagrange multipliers, unless x=y=z, which is impossible, the minimal occurs when x=y.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, but in a way that x² + y² + z² is rational.

Wait, but in our calculations, when x=y, the result is irrational. So, perhaps the minimal occurs when all variables are different, leading to a rational x² + y² + z².

But this complicates the matter.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, the problem says "the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B". So, the sphere must contain all such boxes, not just one particular box. Wait, no, that's not correct. The sphere must contain each box, so for each box, the sphere must contain it. But the sphere's radius is the maximum over all boxes in B of the radius required to contain that box. So, we need to find the minimal r such that every box in B is contained within a sphere of radius r. Thus, r is the maximum of the minimal enclosing sphere radii over all boxes in B.

Wait, that changes the problem. Earlier, I thought we were finding the minimal enclosing sphere for a single box, but it's actually for all boxes in B, so r is the minimal radius such that every box in B fits inside a sphere of radius r. Thus, r is the maximum of the minimal enclosing sphere radii over all boxes in B.

So, my earlier approach was incorrect. I need to find the maximum value of the minimal enclosing sphere radius over all boxes in B, and then find r².

But how?

Each box in B has surface area 54 and volume 23. The minimal enclosing sphere radius for a box is half the space diagonal, which is sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2.

Thus, r = max_{x,y,z} [sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2], where x,y,z satisfy 2(xy + yz + xz)=54 and xyz=23.

Wait, no, but I need the minimal r that works for all boxes in B. So, perhaps the maximum of the minimal enclosing sphere radii across all boxes in B.

Thus, I need to find the maximum of sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2 over x,y,z in B, and then r is that maximum, so r² is (x² + y² + z²)/4.

But to find the maximum, I need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z² subject to 2(xy + yz + xz)=54 and xyz=23.

Wait, so earlier I was trying to minimize x² + y² + z², but now I need to find its maximum.

Wait, no, because the sphere must contain all boxes, so the radius must be at least as large as the largest possible space diagonal of any box in B. So, r is the maximum of (sqrt(x² + y² + z²))/2 over all boxes in B. Thus, r² is the maximum of (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, I need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z² subject to 2(xy + yz + xz)=54 and xyz=23.

This is different from before. So, now, I need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z² given those constraints.

So, perhaps the maximum occurs when one variable is as large as possible, and the other two are as small as possible, given the constraints.

Let me think. To maximize x² + y² + z², perhaps we need to maximize one variable while keeping the others as small as possible.

But given the constraints, if one variable is large, the others must be small to keep the volume constant.

But let's explore this.

Let me denote the variables as x, y, z, all positive.

We need to maximize x² + y² + z² with 2(xy + yz + xz)=54 and xyz=23.

Let me consider the case where one variable is large, say x is large, and y and z are small.

But since xyz=23, if x is large, then y*z must be small, but 2(xy + yz + xz)=54.

So, let me fix x and try to find y and z.

Given x, then y*z=23/x.

We also have 2(xy + yz + xz)=54 => xy + yz + xz=27.

Expressed in terms of y and z:

xy + yz + xz = y(x + z) + xz=27.

But with y*z=23/x.

Let me set s = y + z, p = y*z=23/x.

Then, from the equation: y(x + z) + xz = x(y + z) + yz= x s + p=27.

So, x s + p=27.

But p=23/x, so:

x s +23/x=27.

Thus, s= (27 -23/x)/x=27/x -23/x².

We need to express x² + y² + z² in terms of x.

We know that y² + z²= (y + z)^2 - 2yz= s² -2p.

Thus, x² + y² + z²= x² + s² -2p.

Substitute s and p:

s=27/x -23/x².

p=23/x.

Thus,

x² + (27/x -23/x²)^2 -2*(23/x).

Expand the square:

(27/x -23/x²)^2= (27/x)^2 - 2*(27/x)*(23/x²) + (23/x²)^2=729/x² - 1242/x³ +529/x^4.

Thus, x² + y² + z²= x² +729/x² -1242/x³ +529/x^4 -46/x.

So, f(x)=x² +729/x² -1242/x³ +529/x^4 -46/x.

We need to find the maximum of f(x) for x >0.

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can find critical points by taking the derivative.

Compute f'(x):

f'(x)=2x - (2*729)/x³ + (3*1242)/x^4 - (4*529)/x^5 +46/x².

Set f'(x)=0.

This is a complicated equation, but perhaps we can find rational roots.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs at a particular symmetric point.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal.

Wait, let me consider when y=z.

Let me set y=z.

Then, from volume: x y²=23.

From surface area: 2(xy + y² + xy)=2(2xy + y²)=54 => 2xy + y²=27.

From volume: x=23/(y²).

Substitute into surface area equation:

2*(23/(y²))*y + y²=27.

Simplify:

46/y + y²=27.

Multiply both sides by y:

46 + y³=27y.

Rearranged: y³ -27y +46=0.

This is the same cubic equation as before.

So, solutions are y=2 and y= (-1 ±2√6).

But y must be positive, so y=2 or y= -1 +2√6≈3.898.

So, when y=2, x=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, x=5.75, y=z=2.

Compute x² + y² +z²= (5.75)^2 +2*(2)^2=33.0625 +8=41.0625=657/16.

When y= -1 +2√6≈3.898, x=23/(y²)=23/(25 -4√6).

As before, rationalizing:

x=23/(25 -4√6)=23*(25 +4√6)/(25² - (4√6)^2)=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529=(25 +4√6)/23.

So, x≈1.513.

Then, x² + y² + z²= x² +2y²= (25 +4√6)^2/(23)^2 +2*(25 -4√6).

Compute (25 +4√6)^2=625 + 200√6 +96=721 +200√6.

So, x²= (721 +200√6)/529.

2y²=2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

Thus, x² + y² + z²= (721 +200√6)/529 +50 -8√6.

Convert 50 to 50*529/529=26450/529.

-8√6= (-8√6)*529/529= (-4232√6)/529.

So,

x² + y² + z²= (721 +200√6 +26450 -4232√6)/529.

Combine like terms:

721 +26450=27171.

200√6 -4232√6= -4032√6.

Thus, x² + y² + z²= (27171 -4032√6)/529≈(27171 -4032*2.449)/529≈(27171 -9872)/529≈17299/529≈32.7.

So, when y=z≈3.898, x≈1.513, x² + y² + z²≈32.7.

Earlier, when y=z=2, x=5.75, x² + y² + z²=41.0625.

So, which is larger? 41.0625 is larger than 32.7, so the maximum occurs at y=z=2, x=5.75.

Wait, but I thought the maximum would be when variables are spread out, but in this case, when variables are more spread out (x=5.75, y=z=2), the sum x² + y² + z² is larger.

But when variables are more balanced (x≈1.513, y=z≈3.898), the sum is smaller.

Thus, the maximum of x² + y² + z² occurs when one variable is as large as possible, and the other two are as small as possible, given the constraints.

In this case, when x=5.75, y=z=2, the sum is 41.0625, which is larger than the other case.

Thus, the maximum occurs at x=5.75, y=z=2.

So, r² is (x² + y² + z²)/4=657/16 /4=657/64.

Wait, no.

Wait, x² + y² + z²=657/16.

Thus, r²= (657/16)/4=657/64.

Simplify 657 divided by 64.

657 divided by 64 is 10 with a remainder of 17, so 10 and 17/64.

But the problem states that r² can be written as p/q with p and q coprime.

657 and 64: 64 is 2^6, 657 is divisible by 3: 6+5+7=18, yes.

657 ÷3=219.

219 ÷3=73.

So, 657=3^2 *73.

64=2^6.

No common factors, so 657/64 is reduced.

Thus, p=657, q=64. p+q=657+64=721.

Wait, but earlier when I thought I was minimizing, I found a lower value, but the problem requires the maximum, which is 657/64.

So, the answer is 721.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we need to determine the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The radius \( r \) is half the space diagonal of the box, so \( r^2 = \frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{4} \). 

Given the constraints:
1. \( 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 \) implies \( xy + yz + xz = 27 \).
2. \( xyz = 23 \).

We aim to maximize \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) to find the largest possible space diagonal, ensuring the sphere can contain all such boxes.

By analyzing the problem, we find that the maximum \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) occurs when one dimension is maximized while the other two are minimized. Solving the cubic equation derived from the constraints, we find two critical points for the dimensions. The configuration where one dimension is \( \frac{23}{4} = 5.75 \) and the other two are 2 yields the maximum \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = \frac{657}{16} \).

Thus, \( r^2 = \frac{657}{64} \). Expressing this as \( \frac{p}{q} \) with \( p \) and \( q \) coprime, we find \( p = 657 \) and \( q = 64 \). Therefore, \( p + q = 657 + 64 = 721 \).

\boxed{721}
