Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). I need to find the distance from the incenter I to each face, which is the same for all faces. The answer should be in the form m sqrt(n)/p where m and p are coprime and n is square-free. Then find m + n + p.

Hmm, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So I need to find the volume and the surface area.

But wait, calculating the volume of a tetrahedron usually involves knowing the coordinates of the vertices or using some formula involving edge lengths. Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe this is a special kind of tetrahedron. I think it's called an isosceles tetrahedron or a disphenoid. In such a tetrahedron, all opposite edges are equal, and I remember that for a disphenoid, it's possible to compute the volume using the formula involving the edges.

Let me recall the formula for the volume of a disphenoid. I think it's something like V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) )) / 72, but I'm not sure. Wait, that might be for a different kind of tetrahedron. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to make it easier. Since opposite edges are equal, maybe the points can be placed symmetrically.

Let me try assigning coordinates to the vertices. Let's set point A at (x, y, z), B at (-x, -y, z), C at (-x, y, -z), and D at (x, -y, -z). This way, the edges AB, CD, AC, BD, BC, AD should all have the same lengths as given.

So let me compute AB first. AB is the distance between A(x,y,z) and B(-x,-y,z). So AB squared is (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0^2 = 4x² + 4y². Given that AB = sqrt(41), so 4x² + 4y² = 41. So x² + y² = 41/4.

Similarly, let's compute AC. AC is between A(x,y,z) and C(-x,y,-z). The squared distance is (2x)^2 + 0^2 + (2z)^2 = 4x² + 4z². Given AC = sqrt(80), so 4x² + 4z² = 80, which simplifies to x² + z² = 20.

Next, compute BC. BC is between B(-x,-y,z) and C(-x,y,-z). The squared distance is 0^2 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 = 4y² + 4z². Given BC = sqrt(89), so 4y² + 4z² = 89, meaning y² + z² = 89/4.

Now I have three equations:

1. x² + y² = 41/4,
2. x² + z² = 20,
3. y² + z² = 89/4.

I can solve these equations for x², y², z².

Let me denote equations 1, 2, 3 as:

(1) x² + y² = 41/4,

(2) x² + z² = 20,

(3) y² + z² = 89/4.

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2): (x² + z²) - (x² + y²) = 20 - 41/4 => z² - y² = (80/4 - 41/4) = 39/4.

But from equation (3), y² + z² = 89/4. So now we have:

z² - y² = 39/4,

z² + y² = 89/4.

Adding these two equations: 2z² = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32. So z² = 16, so z = 4 or z = -4. Since z is squared, we can take z = 4.

Subtracting: (z² + y²) - (z² - y²) = 89/4 - 39/4 => 2y² = 50/4 = 25/2. So y² = 25/4, so y = 5/2 or y = -5/2. Let's take y = 5/2.

Then from equation (1): x² + (25/4) = 41/4 => x² = (41 -25)/4 = 16/4 = 4, so x = 2 or x = -2.

So now we have:

x = 2, y = 5/2, z = 4.

So coordinates of the points are:

A: (2, 5/2, 4),

B: (-2, -5/2, 4),

C: (-2, 5/2, -4),

D: (2, -5/2, -4).

Alright, so now I can compute the volume using the coordinates. The volume of a tetrahedron can be found using the scalar triple product formula:

V = |(AB · (AC × AD))| / 6.

First, let me compute vectors AB, AC, AD.

Wait, actually, since the coordinates are known, maybe it's easier to compute vectors from one vertex and take the scalar triple product.

Wait, another approach: the volume can also be computed as 1/6 times the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by vectors from the same vertex.

Alternatively, since the coordinates are symmetric, maybe I can find the volume another way.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant. That might be a good approach since I know all the edge lengths.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume = sqrt( determinant / 288 ), where determinant is the determinant of the following matrix:

0  1    1    1    1

1  0  a²  b²  c²

1  a²  0  d²  e²

1  b²  d²  0  f²

1  c²  e²  f²  0

So in our case, the edge lengths are:

AB = sqrt(41) => a = sqrt(41),

AC = sqrt(80) => b = sqrt(80),

AD = sqrt(89) => c = sqrt(89),

BC = sqrt(89) => d = sqrt(89),

BD = sqrt(80) => e = sqrt(80),

CD = sqrt(41) => f = sqrt(41).

So let's plug these into the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

So let me write this matrix down:

0 1 1 1 1

1 0 41 80 89

1 41 0 89 80

1 80 89 0 41

1 89 80 41 0

I need to calculate the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. Hmm, that's a bit involved, but perhaps we can find a pattern or simplify it.

Alternatively, since the matrix is symmetric, maybe we can find a pattern. Let me denote the matrix as M.

M = [
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 0, 41, 80, 89],
[1, 41, 0, 89, 80],
[1, 80, 89, 0, 41],
[1, 89, 80, 41, 0]
]

I can try to compute the determinant step by step. Alternatively, perhaps subtract rows to create zeros.

Let me try subtracting Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4, 5 to exploit zeros. Wait, but in this case, Rows 2,3,4,5 have similar structures.

Alternatively, perhaps perform row operations to simplify. Let's see:

Subtract Row 1 from Row 2: Row2 = Row2 - Row1.

Row2: 1-1=0, 0-1=-1, 41-1=40, 80-1=79, 89-1=88.

So new Row2: [0, -1, 40, 79, 88]

Similarly, subtract Row1 from Row3: Row3 = Row3 - Row1.

Row3: 1-1=0, 41-1=40, 0-1=-1, 89-1=88, 80-1=79.

So Row3: [0, 40, -1, 88, 79]

Subtract Row1 from Row4: Row4 = Row4 - Row1.

Row4: 1-1=0, 80-1=79, 89-1=88, 0-1=-1, 41-1=40.

Row4: [0, 79, 88, -1, 40]

Subtract Row1 from Row5: Row5 = Row5 - Row1.

Row5: 1-1=0, 89-1=88, 80-1=79, 41-1=40, 0-1=-1.

Row5: [0, 88, 79, 40, -1]

So now, the matrix becomes:

Row0: 0 1 1 1 1

Row1: 1 0 41 80 89

Row2: 0 -1 40 79 88

Row3: 0 40 -1 88 79

Row4: 0 79 88 -1 40

Row5: 0 88 79 40 -1

Now, since we have zeros in the first column except for Row1, we can expand the determinant along the first column.

The determinant will be equal to:

1 * det(minor of element at (1,0)) - 0 + 0 - 0 + 0.

So the determinant is equal to the minor of (1,0), which is the determinant of the 4x4 matrix:

Row0': -1 40 79 88

Row1': 40 -1 88 79

Row2': 79 88 -1 40

Row3': 88 79 40 -1

Wait, no, actually, the minor is the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing Row1 and Column0.

So the minor is:

Row0': 1 1 1 1

Row1': -1 40 79 88

Row2': 40 -1 88 79

Row3': 79 88 -1 40

Row4': 88 79 40 -1

Wait, no, wait. The original matrix after row operations is:

Row0: 0 1 1 1 1

Row1: 1 0 41 80 89

Row2: 0 -1 40 79 88

Row3: 0 40 -1 88 79

Row4: 0 79 88 -1 40

Row5: 0 88 79 40 -1

But the minor for element (1,0) is the determinant of the matrix obtained by removing Row1 and Column0. So the minor is:

Row0': 0 1 1 1 1 (excluding Column0, which is the first column)

But no, actually, when you remove Row1 and Column0, the minor is a 4x4 matrix:

Rows 0,2,3,4,5: no, wait, original matrix is 5x5, so minor after removing Row1 and Column0 is a 4x4 matrix consisting of Rows 0,2,3,4 and Columns 1,2,3,4.

So the minor is:

Row0': 1 1 1 1

Row1': -1 40 79 88

Row2': 40 -1 88 79

Row3': 79 88 -1 40

Row4': 88 79 40 -1

Wait, no, the minor is Rows 0,2,3,4 and Columns 1,2,3,4:

So the minor matrix is:

First row (Row0): [1,1,1,1]

Second row (Row2): [-1,40,79,88]

Third row (Row3): [40,-1,88,79]

Fourth row (Row4): [79,88,-1,40]

Fifth row (Row5): [88,79,40,-1]

Wait, no, because after removing Row1 and Column0, the remaining rows are 0,2,3,4,5? Wait, no, in a 5x5 matrix, removing Row1 gives us 4 rows: 0,2,3,4,5? No, original matrix has 5 rows, numbered 0 to 4, right? So when we remove Row1, which is index 1, the remaining rows are 0,2,3,4. Similarly, columns are 0 to 4, so removing Column0, the remaining columns are 1,2,3,4. So the minor is a 4x4 matrix of Rows 0,2,3,4 and Columns 1,2,3,4.

So:

Row0: [1,1,1,1]

Row2: [-1,40,79,88]

Row3: [40,-1,88,79]

Row4: [79,88,-1,40]

Wait, no, I think I may have miscounted. Let me clarify:

Original matrix after row operations is:

Row0: 0 1 1 1 1

Row1: 1 0 41 80 89

Row2: 0 -1 40 79 88

Row3: 0 40 -1 88 79

Row4: 0 79 88 -1 40

Row5: 0 88 79 40 -1

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 5x5 matrix has rows 0,1,2,3,4. So when we remove Row1 and Column0, the minor is:

Row0: [1,1,1,1] (from Column1,2,3,4)

Row2: [-1,40,79,88]

Row3: [40,-1,88,79]

Row4: [79,88,-1,40]

So the minor matrix is:

[ [1,1,1,1],
  [-1,40,79,88],
  [40,-1,88,79],
  [79,88,-1,40] ]

So now, the determinant is 1 * det(minor) because the element at (1,0) is 1 and the sign is (+) because (1+0) is odd.

So det(M) = 1 * det(minor).

Now, I need to compute the determinant of this 4x4 matrix. Hmm, that's still a bit complicated, but maybe we can find some patterns or perform row operations to simplify it.

Let me write the minor matrix again:

Row0: 1, 1, 1, 1

Row1: -1,40,79,88

Row2:40, -1,88,79

Row3:79,88,-1,40

Hmm, each row seems to have a similar structure. Maybe subtract Row0 from the other rows to create zeros.

Let me try that. Subtract Row0 from Rows1,2,3.

Row1_new = Row1 - Row0: (-1-1, 40-1, 79-1, 88-1) = (-2, 39, 78, 87)

Row2_new = Row2 - Row0: (40-1, -1-1, 88-1, 79-1) = (39, -2, 87, 78)

Row3_new = Row3 - Row0: (79-1, 88-1, -1-1, 40-1) = (78, 87, -2, 39)

So the matrix becomes:

Row0: 1, 1, 1, 1

Row1: -2, 39, 78, 87

Row2: 39, -2, 87, 78

Row3:78,87,-2,39

Now, the determinant remains the same because we performed row operations (subtracting Row0 from others). Now, let's compute this determinant.

Alternatively, maybe expand along Row0 now, since it has all ones. The determinant can be calculated using the first row.

det = 1 * det(minor11) - 1 * det(minor12) + 1 * det(minor13) - 1 * det(minor14)

Where minor11 is the determinant of the 3x3 matrix obtained by removing Row0 and Column1:

[ [39,78,87],
  [-2,87,78],
  [87,-2,39] ]

Similarly, minor12 is removing Row0 and Column2:

[ [-2,78,87],
  [39,87,78],
  [78,-2,39] ]

Minor13: Remove Column3:

[ [-2,39,87],
  [39,-2,78],
  [78,87,-2] ]

Minor14: Remove Column4:

[ [-2,39,78],
  [39,-2,87],
  [78,87,-2] ]

Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe these minors are similar or have some symmetries.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the determinant is symmetric, but I'm not sure. Let's compute each minor.

First, minor11:

Matrix:
39 78 87

-2 87 78

87 -2 39

Let me compute this determinant.

Using the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion.

I'll use cofactor expansion on the first row.

= 39 * det([87,78], [-2,39]) - 78 * det([-2,78], [87,39]) + 87 * det([-2,87], [87,-2])

Compute each 2x2 determinant:

First term: 39*(87*39 - 78*(-2)) = 39*(3393 + 156) = 39*(3549) = Let's compute 3549 * 39.

3549 * 39: compute 3549*40 = 141,960 minus 3549 = 141,960 - 3,549 = 138,411.

Second term: -78*(-2*39 -78*87). Wait, wait, the det([-2,78], [87,39]) is (-2)(39) - (78)(87) = (-78) - 6786 = -6864.

So the second term: -78*(-6864) = 78*6864. Let's compute 78 * 6864.

78 * 6864: 70*6864=480,480; 8*6864=54,912; total=480,480 +54,912=535,392.

Third term: 87*( (-2)*(-2) - 87*87 ). Wait, det([-2,87], [87,-2]) = (-2)(-2) - (87)(87) = 4 - 7569 = -7565.

So third term: 87*(-7565) = -658,  87 * 7565. Wait, 87*7000=609,000; 87*565=49, 005? Wait, 565*87. Let me compute 500*87=43,500; 65*87=5,655. So 43,500 +5,655=49,155. So 87*7565=609,000 +49,155=658,155. Since it's negative, it's -658,155.

So total determinant for minor11: 138,411 + 535,392 - 658,155.

Compute 138,411 + 535,392 = 673,803.

673,803 - 658,155 = 15,648.

So minor11 determinant is 15,648.

Now, moving on to minor12:

Matrix after removing Row0 and Column2:

Row1: -2,78,87

Row2:39,87,78

Row3:78,-2,39

Compute determinant:

-2*(87*39 -78*(-2)) -78*(39*39 -78*78) +87*(39*(-2) -87*78)

Wait, that's complicated. Alternatively, maybe use cofactor expansion.

Alternatively, observe if the matrix has any symmetry or patterns.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

First, write the matrix:

-2  78  87

39 87  78

78 -2  39

Compute the determinant:

= -2*(87*39 -78*(-2)) -78*(39*39 -78*78) +87*(39*(-2) -87*78)

Compute each component:

First term: -2*(3393 + 156) = -2*(3549) = -7098

Second term: -78*(1521 - 6084) = -78*(-4563) = 78*4563

Compute 78 *4563: 70*4563=319,410; 8*4563=36,504; total=319,410 +36,504=355,914

Third term: 87*(-78 - 6786) =87*(-6864)= -87*6864

Compute 87*6864: 80*6864=549,120; 7*6864=48,048; total=549,120 +48,048=597,168. So with the negative, it's -597,168.

So total determinant:

-7098 + 355,914 -597,168

Compute -7098 + 355,914 = 348,816

348,816 -597,168 = -248,352

So minor12 determinant is -248,352.

Moving on to minor13:

Matrix after removing Row0 and Column3:

Row1: -2,39,78

Row2:39,-2,87

Row3:78,87,-2

Compute determinant.

Again, using cofactor expansion on the first row.

= -2 * det([ -2, 87 ], [87, -2 ]) -39 * det([39,87], [78,-2]) +78 * det([39,-2], [78,87])

Compute each 2x2 determinant:

First term: -2*( (-2)*(-2) -87*87 ) = -2*(4 - 7569) = -2*(-7565) = 15,130.

Second term: -39*(39*(-2) -87*78 ) = -39*( -78 -6786 ) = -39*(-6864) = 39*6864. Compute 39*6864: 40*6864=274,560; subtract 6864: 274,560 -6,864=267,696. So the second term is -39*(-6864)= 267,696.

Wait, actually, no. The term is -39*( ... ). Wait, the determinant is (39*(-2) -87*78) = (-78 - 6786) = -6864. So the second term is -39*(-6864) = 39*6864=267,696.

Third term: 78*(39*87 - (-2)*78 ) =78*(3393 + 156) =78*(3549). Compute 78*3000=234,000; 78*549=42,882. So total=234,000 +42,882=276,882.

So total determinant: 15,130 +267,696 +276,882 = Let's compute:

15,130 +267,696 = 282,826

282,826 +276,882 = 559,708

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the first term is 15,130, the second is +267,696, the third is +276,882. So sum: 15,130 +267,696 = 282,826; 282,826 +276,882 = 559,708.

So minor13 determinant is 559,708.

Now, minor14:

Matrix after removing Row0 and Column4:

Row1: -2,39,78

Row2:39,-2,87

Row3:78,87,-2

Wait, this is the same as minor13? Wait, no, removing Column4 gives us:

Wait, the original minor14 matrix is removing Row0 and Column4 (the last column), so the matrix would be:

Row1: -2,39,78

Row2:39,-2,87

Row3:78,87,-2

Wait, that's the same as minor13. Because Column4 is the last column, so removing it leaves Columns1,2,3.

Wait, but minor13 was removing Column3, which left Columns1,2,4. So no, they are different.

Wait, no. Wait, for minor14, we remove Column4 (the last column), so the matrix is:

Row1: -2,39,78

Row2:39,-2,87

Row3:78,87,-2

Wait, that's the same as minor13? No, the columns are different. Let me check.

Wait, for minor13, we removed Column3, so the columns left are 1,2,4. For minor14, we remove Column4, so the columns left are 1,2,3. So the matrices are different.

Wait, perhaps I made an error earlier. Let me recheck:

Minor14 is the determinant of the matrix obtained by removing Row0 and Column4.

Original minor14 matrix:

Row1: -2,39,78

Row2:39,-2,87

Row3:78,87,-2

Wait, so it's similar to minor13 but different.

Compute determinant:

= -2 * det( [ -2, 87 ], [87, -2 ]) -39 * det( [39,87], [78,-2] ) +78 * det( [39,-2], [78,87] )

Compute each term:

First term: -2*(4 - 7569) = -2*(-7565) = 15,130

Second term: -39*(39*(-2) -87*78 ) = -39*(-78 -6786) = -39*(-6864) = 39*6864=267,696

Third term: 78*(39*87 - (-2)*78 ) =78*(3393 + 156) =78*3549=276,882

So same as minor13, the determinant is 15,130 +267,696 +276,882=559,708.

Wait, that's the same as minor13. Hmm, that's odd. Maybe the determinant is the same.

So, moving on, now the determinant of the minor is:

det = 1*(15,648) -1*(-248,352) +1*(559,708) -1*(559,708)

Wait, wait:

det = 1*minor11 -1*minor12 +1*minor13 -1*minor14

= 15,648 - (-248,352) +559,708 -559,708

Simplify:

15,648 +248,352 +559,708 -559,708.

Simplify term by term:

15,648 +248,352 = 264,000

264,000 +559,708 = 823,708

823,708 -559,708 = 264,000

So the determinant of the minor is 264,000.

Wait, that's a round number. So det(minor) = 264,000.

Thus, the determinant of the original 5x5 Cayley-Menger matrix is 1 * 264,000.

Wait, no. The determinant of the original matrix is 1 * det(minor) = 264,000.

So, Volume = sqrt( |det| / 288 ) = sqrt(264,000 / 288 )

Simplify 264,000 / 288.

Divide numerator and denominator by 48: 264,000 ÷48=5,500; 288 ÷48=6.

So 5,500 /6 = 2,750 /3.

So Volume = sqrt( 2750 /3 )

Simplify sqrt(2750/3).

2750 = 25*110 = 25*10*11 = 250*11.

So sqrt(2750/3) = sqrt(250*11 /3) = sqrt(250/3 *11) = sqrt(250/3)*sqrt(11).

But 250/3 = (25*10)/3 = 25*(10/3). So sqrt(25*(10/3)) =5*sqrt(10/3).

Thus, Volume =5*sqrt(10/3)*sqrt(11) =5*sqrt(110/3).

Wait, let me check that again:

2750/3 = (25*110)/3.

sqrt(2750/3) = sqrt(25*110/3) =5*sqrt(110/3).

Yes, that's correct.

So, Volume =5*sqrt(110/3).

Alternatively, we can write this as (5 sqrt(330))/3, since sqrt(110/3)=sqrt(330)/3.

Wait, because sqrt(110/3) = sqrt(110*3)/3 = sqrt(330)/3.

So, Volume =5 * (sqrt(330)/3 )= (5 sqrt(330))/3.

Wait, but let me verify the calculation:

264,000 /288: Let me compute 264,000 ÷288.

Divide numerator and denominator by 24: 264,000 ÷24=11,000; 288 ÷24=12.

So 11,000/12 = 2,750/3.

Yes, so 264,000/288=2,750/3.

So sqrt(2,750/3) is sqrt(2,750)/sqrt(3).

2,750=25*110, so sqrt(25*110)=5*sqrt(110).

Thus, Volume =5 sqrt(110)/sqrt(3) =5 sqrt(330)/3.

So, Volume V =5 sqrt(330)/3.

Wait, but let me verify: sqrt(110/3) is sqrt(110)/sqrt(3), so 5 sqrt(110)/sqrt(3) is 5 sqrt(330)/3, yes.

So, V=5 sqrt(330)/3.

Now, next step is to find the total surface area S.

Each face of the tetrahedron is a triangle. There are four faces. Since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, all faces are congruent? Wait, no, in a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal, but the faces are congruent in pairs.

Wait, in our problem, the edges are AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, BC=AD=√89.

So, the faces are triangles with sides:

Face ABC: edges AB=√41, AC=√80, BC=√89.

Similarly, face ABD: AB=√41, BD=√80, AD=√89.

Face ACD: AC=√80, CD=√41, AD=√89.

Face BCD: BC=√89, CD=√41, BD=√80.

So each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89.

Thus, all four faces are congruent triangles because each has the same side lengths. Therefore, the surface area S is 4 times the area of one face.

So, let's compute the area of one face, say triangle ABC with sides a=√41, b=√80, c=√89.

We can use Heron's formula. First, compute semi-perimeter s:

s = (a + b + c)/2 = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2.

But computing Heron's formula with square roots might be messy. Alternatively, since all sides squared are known, perhaps we can compute the area using another formula, like 1/2 ab sin(theta), but that requires knowing the angle.

Alternatively, let's compute the area using Heron's formula.

Compute s:

s = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2.

But let me compute s² to see if it simplifies, but maybe it's easier to compute numerically.

Wait, perhaps another way: since the triangle has sides a, b, c, the area can also be computed using the formula:

Area = (1/4) sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )

This is another form of Heron's formula.

So let me compute each term:

Let a = √41, b=√80, c=√89.

Compute:

(a + b + c) = √41 + √80 + √89,

(-a + b + c) = (-√41 + √80 + √89),

(a - b + c) = (√41 - √80 + √89),

(a + b - c) = (√41 + √80 - √89).

Hmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can square each term.

Alternatively, let me compute the product:

(a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) = [ (b + c)^2 - a^2 ][ a^2 - (b - c)^2 ]

Which is [ (b^2 + c^2 + 2bc) - a^2 ] [ a^2 - (b^2 + c^2 - 2bc) ]

Compute each bracket:

First bracket: (b² + c² + 2bc - a² )

Second bracket: (a² - b² - c² + 2bc )

So their product is [ (b² + c² + 2bc - a²)(a² - b² - c² + 2bc) ]

Let me denote X = b² + c² - a², then the first bracket is X + 4bc, and the second bracket is 2bc - X.

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, let me compute:

First term: (b² + c² - a²) + 2bc = (b² + c² - a²) + 2bc.

Wait, no, in the first bracket, it's (b² + c² + 2bc - a²) = ( (b + c)^2 - a² )

Second bracket: (a² - (b² + c² - 2bc )) = (a² - b² - c² + 2bc ) = ( a² - (b - c)^2 )

Hmm, perhaps another approach: Let me compute (a + b + c)(-a + b + c) = ( (b + c)^2 - a^2 ).

Similarly, (a - b + c)(a + b - c) = (a^2 - (b - c)^2 ).

So the product is [ (b + c)^2 - a^2 ][ a^2 - (b - c)^2 ].

Compute each term:

(b + c)^2 = b² + c² + 2bc = 80 + 89 + 2*sqrt(80*89) = 169 + 2*sqrt(7120)

Similarly, (b + c)^2 - a² = (169 + 2*sqrt(7120)) -41 = 128 + 2*sqrt(7120)

Similarly, a² =41, (b - c)^2 = b² + c² - 2bc =80 +89 -2*sqrt(80*89)=169 - 2*sqrt(7120)

So a² - (b - c)^2 =41 - (169 - 2*sqrt(7120))= -128 + 2*sqrt(7120)

So the product is [128 + 2*sqrt(7120)] * [ -128 + 2*sqrt(7120) ].

This looks like (x + y)(-x + y) = y² -x².

So here, x=128, y=2 sqrt(7120).

Thus, the product is (2 sqrt(7120))² - (128)^2 =4*7120 - 16384.

Compute 4*7120=28,480.

28,480 -16,384=12,096.

So the product is 12,096.

So the area squared is (1/16)*12,096 = 12,096 /16=756.

Thus, the area is sqrt(756).

Simplify sqrt(756):

756=4*189=4*9*21=4*9*3*7=2²*3²*3*7.

Thus, sqrt(756)=2*3*sqrt(21)=6 sqrt(21).

So the area of one face is 6 sqrt(21).

Therefore, the total surface area S =4 *6 sqrt(21)=24 sqrt(21).

Wait, that's interesting. So S=24 sqrt(21).

Now, going back to the inradius formula: r = 3V / S.

We have V=5 sqrt(330)/3, and S=24 sqrt(21).

So,

r = 3*(5 sqrt(330)/3) / (24 sqrt(21)) )

Simplify numerator: 3*(5 sqrt(330)/3 )=5 sqrt(330).

So,

r =5 sqrt(330) / (24 sqrt(21)).

Simplify sqrt(330)/sqrt(21)=sqrt(330/21)=sqrt(110/7).

So,

r=5 sqrt(110/7)/24.

Alternatively, rationalize the denominator:

sqrt(110/7)=sqrt(770)/7.

So,

r=5 * sqrt(770)/7 /24 =5 sqrt(770)/(7*24)=5 sqrt(770)/168.

But let me check this step again.

Wait, sqrt(110/7) can be written as sqrt(770)/7, yes.

So,

r=5 sqrt(770)/(7*24)=5 sqrt(770)/168.

But let's see if 770 can be simplified. 770 factors into 77*10=7*11*2*5.

So sqrt(770)=sqrt(2*5*7*11). No square factors, so n=770.

But 770 is square-free? Wait, 770=2*5*7*11, yes, all primes, so yes.

Wait, but wait, 770=7*110=7*10*11= same as before.

So sqrt(770) is simplified.

Thus, r=5 sqrt(770)/168.

But let me check the arithmetic again.

Wait, 3V/S= (3*(5 sqrt(330)/3 )) / (24 sqrt(21)) )=5 sqrt(330)/(24 sqrt(21)).

Then sqrt(330)/sqrt(21)=sqrt(330/21)=sqrt(110/7). So 5 sqrt(110/7)/24.

Which can be written as 5 sqrt(110)/sqrt(7)/24.

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(7):

5 sqrt(110)*sqrt(7)/(24*sqrt(7)*sqrt(7))=5 sqrt(770)/(24*7)=5 sqrt(770)/(168).

Yes, so r=5 sqrt(770)/168.

Wait, but 770 is 77*10=7*11*2*5, so square-free.

So, the distance is 5 sqrt(770)/168.

Wait, but let me make sure that 770 is square-free. Since 770=2*5*7*11, none of the primes are squared, so yes, it's square-free. So n=770, m=5, p=168.

But wait, m and p need to be coprime. Are 5 and 168 coprime? 168 factors into 2^3 *3*7. 5 is prime and doesn't divide 168, so yes, they are coprime.

So, the distance is 5 sqrt(770)/168, so m=5, n=770, p=168.

Thus, m +n +p=5 +770 +168=943.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations because 943 seems a bit large, and I might have made a mistake in the volume or surface area.

Wait, let me recheck the Cayley-Menger determinant.

Wait, when I computed the determinant of the minor, I got 264,000. So the determinant of the original matrix is 264,000, so Volume = sqrt(264,000 /288 )=sqrt(916.666...).

Wait, but earlier I thought 264,000 /288 = 916.666..., but that's incorrect.

Wait, 264,000 ÷288: Let me compute 288 * 900=259,200. 264,000-259,200=4,800.

288*16=4,608. So 900+16=916, 4,800-4,608=192.

288*0.666=192. So 916 + 2/3 ≈916.666.

Wait, but 264,000 /288= 916.666..., which is 2750/3.

Wait, 288 *916=288*(900+16)=288*900=259,200 +288*16=4,608. Total=263,808. 264,000-263,808=192. 192/288=2/3. So yes, 2750/3≈916.666.

So Volume = sqrt(2750/3)=sqrt(916.666...).

Earlier, I thought that sqrt(2750/3)=5*sqrt(110/3)=5*sqrt(330)/3, but wait:

Wait, 2750/3= (25*110)/3=25*(110/3). So sqrt(25*(110/3))=5*sqrt(110/3). Yes.

But 110/3 is not 330/9. Wait, sqrt(110/3)=sqrt(330)/3.

Wait, because sqrt(110/3)=sqrt( (110*3)/(3*3) )=sqrt(330)/3.

Yes, so sqrt(110/3)=sqrt(330)/3.

Thus, 5*sqrt(110/3)=5*sqrt(330)/3.

So Volume=5 sqrt(330)/3.

So that's correct.

Then, for surface area, each face is 6 sqrt(21), so 4 faces:24 sqrt(21).

Then, r=3V/S=3*(5 sqrt(330)/3 )/(24 sqrt(21))=5 sqrt(330)/(24 sqrt(21)).

Simplify sqrt(330)/sqrt(21)=sqrt(330/21)=sqrt(110/7).

Thus, r=5 sqrt(110/7)/24.

But sqrt(110/7)=sqrt(770)/7, so 5 sqrt(770)/(7*24)=5 sqrt(770)/168.

Yes, that's correct.

So m=5, n=770, p=168. So m +n +p=5 +770 +168=943.

Wait, but 770 is a large number. Let me think: is there a way to simplify sqrt(770)? As before, 770=2*5*7*11, so no, it's square-free. So the distance is indeed 5 sqrt(770)/168.

So the final answer is 5 +770 +168=943.

But wait, I just remembered that in a disphenoid, the inradius can be calculated using another formula. Maybe I should check if I made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant.

Wait, let me double-check the Cayley-Menger determinant calculation because that was a very crucial step.

We had the determinant of the minor as 264,000, so the determinant of the original matrix is 264,000.

So Volume = sqrt(264000 /288 )=sqrt(916.666...)=sqrt(2750/3).

Which is 5 sqrt(110/3)=5 sqrt(330)/3, which is correct.

Wait, but 264,000 divided by 288 is 916.666... which is 2750/3.

Yes, so that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume another way to confirm.

Since I have coordinates for all points, perhaps I can compute the volume via the scalar triple product.

Given points A(2,5/2,4), B(-2,-5/2,4), C(-2,5/2,-4), D(2,-5/2,-4).

Let me consider vectors from point A: vectors AB, AC, AD.

Vector AB = B - A = (-2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, 4-4)=(-4, -5, 0).

Vector AC = C - A = (-2-2,5/2 -5/2, -4 -4)=(-4, 0, -8).

Vector AD = D - A = (2-2, -5/2 -5/2, -4 -4)=(0, -5, -8).

Now, the volume is 1/6 times the absolute value of the scalar triple product AB ⋅ (AC × AD).

Compute AC × AD first.

AC = (-4,0,-8), AD=(0,-5,-8).

Compute cross product:

i    j    k

-4    0   -8

0   -5   -8

= i*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) -0*0 )

= i*(0 - 40) - j*(32 - 0) + k*(20 -0)

= (-40)i -32j +20k

So AC × AD = (-40, -32, 20).

Now, compute AB ⋅ (AC × AD):

AB = (-4, -5, 0).

Dot product: (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) +0*20= 160 +160 +0=320.

Volume = 1/6 * |320|=320/6=160/3.

Wait, but earlier, I got Volume=5 sqrt(330)/3≈5*18.166/3≈90.83/3≈30.28.

But via scalar triple product, I get Volume=160/3≈53.333.

These results are conflicting. So I must have made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant approach.

Wait, that's a problem. So which one is correct?

Well, the scalar triple product is straightforward and based on coordinates, which I computed correctly.

So scalar triple product gives Volume=160/3.

So why did the Cayley-Menger determinant give me 5 sqrt(330)/3≈30.28, while the scalar triple product gives 160/3≈53.333.

Clearly, I must have made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant calculation.

Let me re-examine the Cayley-Menger determinant.

Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB=a, AC=b, AD=c, BC=d, BD=e, CD=f is:

det = | 0 1 1 1 1 |

       | 1 0 a² b² c² |

       | 1 a² 0 d² e² |

       | 1 b² d² 0 f² |

       | 1 c² e² f² 0 |

The volume is sqrt(det / 288).

So let's plug in the edge lengths properly.

Given:

AB=sqrt(41) => a=41,

AC=sqrt(80)=>b=80,

AD=sqrt(89)=>c=89,

BC=sqrt(89)=>d=89,

BD=sqrt(80)=>e=80,

CD=sqrt(41)=>f=41.

So the matrix is:

Row0: 0 1 1 1 1

Row1:1 0 41 80 89

Row2:1 41 0 89 80

Row3:1 80 89 0 41

Row4:1 89 80 41 0

So I had this matrix correct before. Then I performed row operations:

Subtract Row1 from Rows2,3,4,5.

Wait, but in the initial problem, it's a 5x5 matrix, with rows 0 to 4.

Wait, in my previous calculation, I mistakenly considered row indices beyond 4, but actually, it's only 5 rows (0-4).

Wait, in the previous step, I think I confused the row indices, thinking it's 0-5, but actually, it's 0-4.

So, when I subtracted Row1 from the other rows, I should have only four rows (excluding Row1), but in my previous calculation, I treated it as five rows, leading to an incorrect minor.

So, to correct this, let me properly compute the determinant.

The correct Cayley-Menger determinant for a 5x5 matrix, but after row operations, it's better to compute it correctly.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to compute the determinant manually, which is error-prone, I can use the fact that the scalar triple product gives Volume=160/3, and the surface area S=24 sqrt(21), so r=3V/S=3*(160/3)/(24 sqrt(21))=160/(24 sqrt(21))=20/(3 sqrt(21)).

Rationalize: 20 sqrt(21)/(3*21)=20 sqrt(21)/63.

So r=20 sqrt(21)/63.

Then, m=20, n=21, p=63.

But wait, 20 and 63 are coprime? 20 factors into 2²*5; 63=7*3². No common factors, so yes.

n=21 is square-free.

Thus, m +n +p=20 +21 +63=104.

But wait, how does this compare with the scalar triple product result?

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing the surface area.

Wait, if the scalar triple product gives V=160/3, and if surface area S=24 sqrt(21), then r=3V/S= (3*(160/3))/(24 sqrt(21))=160/(24 sqrt(21))=20/(3 sqrt(21))=20 sqrt(21)/63.

So, r=20 sqrt(21)/63.

Thus, m=20, n=21, p=63.

Sum is 20+21+63=104.

But I think this is correct because the scalar triple product is straightforward, whereas the Cayley-Menger determinant calculation was error-prone.

Wait, but then why did the Cayley-Menger determinant give a different result?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant calculation earlier.

Let me double-check: since the scalar triple product gives V=160/3, which is approximately 53.333, and the Cayley-Menger determinant formula is Volume= sqrt(det /288).

So det= (Volume)^2 *288.

So det= ( (160/3)^2 ) *288.

Compute (160/3)^2=25600/9.

25600/9 *288=25600 *32=819,200.

So det=819,200.

But in my previous calculation, I got det=264,000, which is wrong.

So the mistake was in the Cayley-Menger determinant computation earlier.

Thus, the correct determinant is 819,200.

So, I must have made an error in computing the determinant. Therefore, trusting the scalar triple product result, which is straightforward, I can proceed.

So, the inradius r=20 sqrt(21)/63.

Thus, the answer is 20 +21 +63=104.

So, the final answer is 104.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves finding the distance from the incenter of a tetrahedron to its faces. The tetrahedron has equal opposite edges, making it a disphenoid. The inradius formula \( r = \frac{3V}{S} \) is used, where \( V \) is the volume and \( S \) is the total surface area.

### Key Steps:
1. **Volume Calculation**:
   - Using the scalar triple product with coordinates derived from the edge lengths, the volume \( V \) is calculated as \( \frac{160}{3} \).

2. **Surface Area Calculation**:
   - Each face is a congruent triangle with sides \( \sqrt{41} \), \( \sqrt{80} \), and \( \sqrt{89} \). Using Heron's formula, the area of one face is \( 6\sqrt{21} \), leading to a total surface area \( S = 24\sqrt{21} \).

3. **Inradius Calculation**:
   - Substituting \( V \) and \( S \) into the inradius formula, \( r = \frac{3 \times \frac{160}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63} \).

4. **Final Result**:
   - The distance is expressed as \( \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63} \), giving \( m = 20 \), \( n = 21 \), and \( p = 63 \). Thus, \( m + n + p = 104 \).

### Answer:
\boxed{104}
