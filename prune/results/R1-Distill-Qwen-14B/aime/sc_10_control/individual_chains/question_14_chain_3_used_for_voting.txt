Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the greatest four-digit number, N, with a specific property. The property is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient when N is divided by 1000 and R is the remainder. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, N is a four-digit number, so it ranges from 1000 to 9999. And it's the greatest such number, which suggests I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find the right number. But that might take a while, so maybe there's a smarter way.

The key property is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So, for each digit position in N, replacing it with 1 should result in a number that's a multiple of 7. Let's denote the digits of N as a, b, c, d, where a is the thousands digit, b the hundreds, c the tens, and d the ones. So N can be written as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

Now, when we change each digit to 1, we get four different numbers:

1. Changing a to 1: 1bcd = 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d
2. Changing b to 1: a1cd = 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d
3. Changing c to 1: ab1d = 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d
4. Changing d to 1: abc1 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1

Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. So, each of these four numbers modulo 7 should be 0. 

Let me write out the conditions mathematically.

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, for each of these four expressions, the entire number must be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

I think it might help to compute the coefficients modulo 7 first to simplify these expressions.

Let's compute the powers of 10 modulo 7 because the digits are multiplied by powers of 10.

10^0 mod 7 = 1
10^1 mod 7 = 3 (since 10/7 is 1 with remainder 3)
10^2 mod 7 = 3*3=9 mod7=2
10^3 mod7=10^2*10 mod7=2*3=6 mod7=6
10^4 mod7=10^3*10 mod7=6*3=18 mod7=4

Wait, but in our case, the digits are in four-digit numbers, so the places are thousands, hundreds, tens, units, which correspond to 10^3, 10^2, 10^1, 10^0. So their mod7 values are 6, 2, 3, 1 respectively.

So, for the number N = a*1000 + b*100 + c*10 + d, its mod7 is (a*6 + b*2 + c*3 + d*1) mod7.

Similarly, for the numbers obtained by replacing a digit with 1:

1. Replacing a: 1*6 + b*2 + c*3 + d*1 ≡0 mod7
2. Replacing b: a*6 + 1*2 + c*3 + d*1 ≡0 mod7
3. Replacing c: a*6 + b*2 + 1*3 + d*1 ≡0 mod7
4. Replacing d: a*6 + b*2 + c*3 + 1*1 ≡0 mod7

So, each of these four expressions must be congruent to 0 mod7.

So, let's write all four congruences:

1. 6*1 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7
2. 6a + 2*1 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7
3. 6a + 2b + 3*1 + d ≡ 0 mod7
4. 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod7

Let me compute each of these:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡0 mod7
2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡0 mod7
3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡0 mod7
4. 6a + 2b + 3c +1 ≡0 mod7

So, we have four equations:

Equation 1: 2b + 3c + d ≡ -6 mod7 → 2b + 3c + d ≡1 mod7 (since -6 mod7 is 1)
Equation 2: 6a + 3c + d ≡ -2 mod7 → 6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7 (since -2 mod7 is 5)
Equation 3: 6a + 2b + d ≡ -3 mod7 → 6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7 (since -3 mod7 is 4)
Equation 4: 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ -1 mod7 → 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7 (since -1 mod7 is 6)

Hmm, okay. So, four equations with variables a, b, c, d. Since a, b, c, d are digits, each is between 0 and 9, except a which is between 1 and 9 (since it's a four-digit number).

Let me consider that N is the greatest four-digit number, so we can probably assume that a is as large as possible, starting from 9 and going down. So, maybe N is 9xyz, and we can try to find x, y, z such that all four conditions are satisfied.

Let me assign a =9 first and see if that's possible.

So, substituting a=9 into equations 2,3,4.

Equation 2: 6*9 +3c +d =54 +3c +d ≡5 mod7

54 mod7: 7*7=49, 54-49=5, so 54≡5 mod7. So equation 2 becomes 5 +3c +d ≡5 mod7 → 3c +d ≡0 mod7.

Equation 3: 6*9 +2b +d=54 +2b +d ≡4 mod7. 54 mod7 is 5, so 5 +2b +d ≡4 → 2b +d ≡-1 ≡6 mod7.

Equation 4: 6*9 +2b +3c=54 +2b +3c ≡6 mod7. 54 mod7 is 5, so 5 +2b +3c ≡6 → 2b +3c ≡1 mod7.

Equation 1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

So, now we have the following system with a=9:

From equation 2: 3c + d ≡0 mod7 → equation (A)

From equation 3: 2b + d ≡6 mod7 → equation (B)

From equation 4: 2b +3c ≡1 mod7 → equation (C)

From equation 1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7 → equation (D)

Wait, equation (D) can be expressed as (2b+3c) + d ≡1 mod7. From equation (C), 2b +3c ≡1 mod7, so substituting into (D): 1 + d ≡1 mod7 → d ≡0 mod7. So, d must be congruent to 0 mod7. Since d is a digit (0-9), d can be 0 or7.

So, d ∈ {0,7}.

From equation (A): 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

So, if d=0: 3c ≡0 mod7 → c ≡0 mod7/ gcd(3,7)=1. So c must be 0 mod7. Since c is a digit (0-9), c can be 0 or7.

If d=7: 3c +7 ≡0 mod7 → 3c ≡-7 ≡0 mod7 → 3c ≡0 mod7 → c≡0 mod7. So again, c=0 or7.

So, let me consider the two cases: d=0 and d=7.

Case 1: d=0.

Then equation (A): 3c ≡0 mod7 → c=0 or7.

Case 1a: c=0.

Then equation (C): 2b +0 ≡1 mod7 → 2b ≡1 mod7. Multiplying both sides by inverse of 2 mod7, which is 4 since 2*4=8≡1 mod7. So b ≡4*1=4 mod7. So b can be 4 or 11, but since b is a digit, b=4.

Then equation (B): 2b +d= 8 +0=8 ≡1 mod7? Wait, equation (B) is 2b +d ≡6 mod7. Wait, d=0, so 2b ≡6 mod7 → 2b=6 mod7 → b=3 mod7 (since 2*3=6). But earlier, from equation (C), I had 2b≡1 mod7 → b=4 mod7. Now, b has to be 4 and 3 mod7? That's a problem. Contradiction.

So, in case 1a, c=0, d=0, then equation (B) would require b=3 mod7, but equation (C) requires b=4 mod7. So no solution here.

Case 1b: c=7.

Then equation (A): 3*7 +0=21≡0 mod7, which is okay.

Now equation (C): 2b +3*7=2b +21≡2b +0=2b ≡1 mod7 → 2b≡1 mod7 → b=4 mod7 (since 2*4=8≡1).

So, b=4 or 11, but since b is a digit, b=4.

Then equation (B): 2b +d= 8 +0=8≡1 mod7? Wait, no. Wait equation (B) is 2b +d ≡6 mod7. So 8 mod7 is 1, so 1 ≡6 mod7? That's not true. 1≡6 mod7 is false. So, again, contradiction.

So, in case 1, d=0, we can't find a solution because of conflicting requirements on b.

Case 2: d=7.

Then equation (A): 3c +7 ≡0 mod7 → 3c ≡0 mod7 → c=0 or7.

Case 2a: c=0.

Equation (C): 2b +0 ≡1 mod7 → 2b≡1 → b=4 mod7.

Equation (B): 2b +7 ≡6 mod7 → 2b +0=2b ≡6 mod7 → 2b=6 → b=3 mod7.

But from equation (C), b=4 mod7, and now equation (B) says b=3 mod7. Contradiction again.

Case 2b: c=7.

Equation (C): 2b +3*7=2b +21≡2b mod7 → 2b≡1 mod7 → b=4 mod7.

Equation (B): 2b +7≡6 mod7 → 2b +0=2b ≡6 mod7 → 2b=6 → b=3 mod7.

Again, b would have to be both 4 and 3 mod7, which is impossible. So no solution in this case either.

So, when a=9, there's no possible b, c, d that satisfy all four conditions. Therefore, a cannot be 9. So, let's try a=8.

So, set a=8.

Now, equation 2: 6*8 +3c +d=48 +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

48 mod7: 7*6=42, 48-42=6. So 6 +3c +d ≡5 mod7 → 3c +d ≡-1 mod7 →3c +d ≡6 mod7.

Equation 3: 6*8 +2b +d=48 +2b +d ≡4 mod7. 48 mod7 is 6, so 6 +2b +d ≡4 →2b +d ≡-2≡5 mod7.

Equation 4:6*8 +2b +3c=48 +2b +3c ≡6 mod7. 48 mod7 is6, so 6 +2b +3c ≡6 →2b +3c ≡0 mod7.

Equation 1:2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

So, with a=8, our four equations are:

Equation 2:3c +d ≡6 mod7 → equation (A)

Equation 3:2b +d ≡5 mod7 → equation (B)

Equation 4:2b +3c ≡0 mod7 → equation (C)

Equation 1:2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7 → equation (D)

From equation (C): 2b +3c ≡0 mod7.

From equation (D): (2b +3c) + d ≡1 → 0 +d ≡1 mod7 → d≡1 mod7.

So, d can be 1 or 8, since d is a digit.

So, d ∈ {1,8}.

Let's consider d=1 and d=8.

Case 1: d=1.

Then, equation (A):3c +1≡6 →3c≡5 mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 3 mod7, which is 5 because 3*5=15≡1 mod7. So c≡5*5=25≡4 mod7. So c=4 or 11, but since c is a digit, c=4.

Then equation (B):2b +1≡5 →2b≡4 mod7 →b≡2 mod7 (since 2*2=4). So b=2 or 9.

Equation (C):2b +3c=2b +12≡2b +5 mod7. We know 2b +3c ≡0 mod7. So 2b +5≡0 →2b≡2 mod7 →b≡1 mod7.

But from equation (B), b≡2 mod7, and now it's saying b≡1 mod7. Contradiction. So, no solution here.

Case 2: d=8.

Equation (A):3c +8≡6 mod7 →3c +1≡6 →3c≡5 mod7.

Same as before, c≡4 mod7. So c=4 or 11, but c is a digit, so c=4.

Equation (B):2b +8≡5 mod7 →2b +1≡5 →2b≡4 →b≡2 mod7.

Equation (C):2b +3c=2b +12≡2b +5 mod7. 2b +5≡0 mod7 → 2b≡2 →b≡1 mod7.

Again, from equation (B), b≡2 mod7, but equation (C) requires b≡1. Contradiction. So, no solution when d=8 either.

So, a=8 doesn't work. Let's move to a=7.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check for a=8.

Wait, when a=8:

Equation 2:3c +d≡6 mod7.

Equation 3:2b +d≡5 mod7.

Equation 4:2b +3c≡0 mod7.

Equation 1:2b +3c +d≡1 mod7.

From equation 1: (2b +3c) +d ≡1 → 0 +d ≡1 → d ≡1 mod7.

So, d=1 or 8.

Then, for d=1: equation (A):3c=5 mod7 →c=4.

Equation (B):2b=4 mod7 →b=2.

Equation (C):2b +3c=4 +12=16≡2 mod7. But equation (C) requires 0 mod7. So 2≡0 mod7? No.

Similarly, d=8: equation (A):3c=5-1=4 mod7 (since 8≡1 mod7? Wait, no, 8 mod7 is 1. Wait, equation (A):3c +1≡6 →3c≡5. So same as before.

Then, equation (C):2b +3c=0 mod7. 2b +12≡2b +5≡0→2b≡2→b≡1.

But equation (B):2b +1≡5→2b=4→b=2.

So same issue. So, a=8 doesn't work.

Proceeding to a=7.

So, a=7.

Equation 2:6*7 +3c +d=42 +3c +d ≡5 mod7. 42 mod7=0, so 3c +d≡5 mod7.

Equation 3:6*7 +2b +d=42 +2b +d≡4 mod7. 42 mod7=0, so 2b +d≡4 mod7.

Equation 4:6*7 +2b +3c=42 +2b +3c≡6 mod7. 42 mod7=0, so 2b +3c≡6 mod7.

Equation 1:2b +3c +d≡1 mod7.

So, four equations with a=7:

Equation (A):3c + d ≡5 mod7

Equation (B):2b + d ≡4 mod7

Equation (C):2b +3c ≡6 mod7

Equation (D):2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7

From equation (C):2b +3c ≡6.

From equation (D): (2b +3c) + d ≡1 →6 +d ≡1 mod7 →d ≡-5 ≡2 mod7.

So, d=2 or9.

Case 1: d=2.

Equation (A):3c +2 ≡5 mod7 →3c≡3 mod7 →c≡1 mod7. So c=1 or8.

Equation (B):2b +2 ≡4 mod7 →2b≡2 mod7 →b≡1 mod7. So b=1 or8.

Equation (C):2b +3c≡6 mod7.

Let's plug c=1:

Equation (C):2b +3*1=2b +3 ≡6 →2b≡3 mod7. Multiply by inverse of 2, which is 4: b≡12≡5 mod7. So b=5 or12, but b is a digit, so b=5.

Check equation (B):2b +2=10 +2=12≡5 mod7, which should be ≡4 mod7. 5≡4? No. So, inconsistent.

Now, c=8:

Equation (C):2b +3*8=2b +24≡2b +3 ≡6 mod7 →2b≡3 mod7 →b≡5 mod7.

From equation (B):2b +2≡4 →2b≡2→b≡1 mod7. But equation (C) requires b≡5. Contradiction. So no solution when d=2.

Case 2: d=9.

Equation (A):3c +9≡5 mod7 →3c +2≡5 →3c≡3 →c≡1 mod7. So c=1 or8.

Equation (B):2b +9≡4 mod7 →2b +2≡4 →2b≡2→b≡1 mod7. So b=1 or8.

Equation (C):2b +3c≡6 mod7.

First, c=1:

Equation (C):2b +3≡6 →2b≡3→b≡5 mod7.

But from equation (B), b≡1. So, no solution.

c=8:

Equation (C):2b +24≡2b +3≡6→2b≡3→b≡5 mod7.

But equation (B) requires b≡1. Contradiction. So no solution for a=7 either.

Hmm, this is getting tedious. Let me see if there's a pattern or a better approach.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying each a from 9 downwards, maybe I can find relations between the equations.

From equation (C):2b +3c ≡ k (some value), and equation (D):2b +3c +d ≡1. So, if I subtract equation (C) from (D), I get d≡1 -k mod7.

Alternatively, from a=7, I had equation (C):2b +3c ≡6 and equation (D):2b +3c +d ≡1 → d ≡1 -6= -5≡2 mod7.

Hmm, perhaps the same approach applies regardless of a.

Wait, maybe I can find the relationships between the equations.

Let me denote:

Equation 1:2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7

Equation 2:6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7

Equation 3:6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7

Equation 4:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7

Let me subtract equation 3 from equation 2:

Equation 2 - equation3:

(6a +3c +d) - (6a +2b +d) ≡5-4 mod7

So, 3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

But from equation 4, 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

Hmm, equation 4 can be written as 2b +3c ≡6 -6a mod7.

Wait, let me think. Maybe express variables in terms.

Wait, let me consider equations 2 and 3.

Equation 2:6a +3c +d =5 mod7.

Equation 3:6a +2b +d=4 mod7.

Subtracting equation3 from equation2:

(6a +3c +d) - (6a +2b +d) =5 -4 →3c -2b=1 mod7.

So, 3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

From equation (C) in the earlier notation, which is equation 4:2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

So, from equation 4:2b +3c ≡6.

But from above, 3c -2b ≡1.

So, we have:

3c -2b ≡1 mod7

2b +3c ≡6 mod7

Let me add these two equations:

(3c -2b) + (2b +3c) =1 +6 mod7 →6c ≡7≡0 mod7.

So, 6c ≡0 mod7 →c≡0 mod7, since 6 and7 are coprime.

So, c must be ≡0 mod7. So, c=0 or7.

So, c can only be 0 or7.

That's a crucial point. So, regardless of a, c is either 0 or7.

So, that simplifies things.

So, c ∈ {0,7}.

Let me note that.

So, going back, c=0 or7. Let's consider both possibilities.

Case 1: c=0.

Then, from equation 3c -2b ≡1 →0 -2b ≡1 →-2b ≡1 →2b≡-1≡6 mod7 →b≡3 mod7.

So, b=3 or10, but b is a digit, so b=3.

From equation 4:2b +3c=6*3 +0=6≡6 mod7, which is consistent because equation4 says it's ≡6 mod7.

So, okay.

Now, from equation 2:6a +3c +d=6a +0 +d≡5 mod7.

So, 6a +d≡5 mod7.

From equation 3:6a +2b +d=6a +6 +d≡4 mod7.

So, 6a +d ≡4 -6= -2≡5 mod7.

Wait, equation2 says 6a +d≡5, and equation3 says 6a +d≡5 as well. So, consistent.

From equation1:2b +3c +d=6 +0 +d≡1 mod7 →6 +d≡1→d≡-5≡2 mod7. So, d=2 or9.

So, d can be 2 or9.

Now, from equation2:6a +d≡5 mod7.

If d=2: 6a +2≡5→6a≡3→a≡3*(6^{-1}) mod7.

Since 6*6=36≡1 mod7, so 6^{-1}=6 mod7.

So, a≡3*6=18≡4 mod7. So a=4 or11, but a is a digit, so a=4.

If d=9:6a +9≡5→6a≡-4≡3 mod7.

So, a≡3*6^{-1}=3*6=18≡4 mod7. So, a=4 or11, but a is a digit, so a=4.

So, in both cases, a=4.

So, in this case, c=0, b=3, a=4, d=2 or9.

So, possible numbers: 4302 and 4309.

But N is supposed to be a four-digit number, the greatest possible. So, 4309 is higher than 4302. But wait, 4309 is the number, right?

Wait, but we have to check whether all four conditions are satisfied for N=4309.

Wait, let me check:

Changing a to1:1309. 1309 /7=187, which is 187*7=1309. So yes, divisible by7.

Changing b to1:4109. 4109 /7=587, since 587*7=4109.

Changing c to1:4319. 4319 /7=617, since 617*7=4319.

Changing d to1:4301. 4301 /7=614.428... Wait, 614*7=4298, 4301-4298=3. So, remainder 3. Not divisible by7.

Oh no, that's a problem. So, 4301 is not divisible by7. So, 4309 doesn't satisfy the condition when d is changed to1.

Similarly, check 4302:

Changing d to1:4302→4301. Same as above, not divisible by7.

Wait, so neither 4302 nor 4309 satisfies the condition when d is replaced by1.

Hmm, so that means when c=0, we have issues. So, perhaps c must be7.

Case 2: c=7.

From equation 3c -2b ≡1 →21 -2b ≡1 →-2b≡-20≡-20+21=1 mod7 →-2b≡1 →2b≡-1≡6 mod7 →b≡3 mod7.

So, b=3 or10, but since b is a digit, b=3.

From equation4:2b +3c=6 +21=27≡6 mod7, which is consistent.

From equation2:6a +3c +d=6a +21 +d≡5 mod7.

6a +d +0≡5 →6a +d≡5 mod7.

From equation3:6a +2b +d=6a +6 +d≡4 mod7 →6a +d≡-2≡5 mod7.

Same as equation2.

From equation1:2b +3c +d=6 +21 +d=27 +d≡6 +d mod7.

Equation1 requires 6 +d ≡1 mod7 →d≡-5≡2 mod7. So d=2 or9.

So, same as before.

From equation2:6a +d≡5 mod7.

If d=2:6a≡3 mod7 →a≡3*6^{-1}=3*6=18≡4 mod7. So a=4 or11, a=4.

If d=9:6a≡5 -9≡-4≡3 mod7 →a≡4 mod7, so a=4.

So, again, a=4.

So, N is 4372 or4379.

Wait, N would be a=4, b=3, c=7, d=2 or9.

So, numbers are 4372 and4379.

Check N=4379.

Change a to1:1379. 1379/7=197, 197*7=1379. Good.

Change b to1:4179. 4179/7=597, 597*7=4179. Good.

Change c to1:4319. As before, 4319/7=617, okay.

Change d to1:4371. 4371/7=624.428... Wait, 624*7=4368, 4371-4368=3. So remainder 3. Not divisible by7. So, 4371 is not divisible by7. So, 4379 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Similarly, check N=4372.

Change d to1:4372→4371, same as above, not divisible by7.

So, again, neither 4372 nor4379 works.

Hmm, so when c=7 and a=4, it doesn't work because changing d to1 doesn't result in a multiple of7.

Is there another solution? Wait, both cases c=0 and c=7 give a=4, but both don't satisfy all four conditions.

So, maybe a=4 is not the correct value. Wait, but the equations lead us to a=4 when c=0 or7.

Hmm, perhaps a needs to be higher. Wait, but when a=4, and c=7, the number is 4379, which doesn't satisfy the condition when d is changed.

So, perhaps this approach is missing something.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that when a is different, the equations change. So, perhaps for a different a, say a=5 or6, it might work.

Wait, maybe I should try a=6.

Wait, but earlier with a=7, a=8, a=9, it didn't work. So perhaps I need to go down lower.

Wait, but the problem states that N is a four-digit number, so a can't be less than1. So, starting from a=9 down, but all the way down to a=4, but not working.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, when a=4, c=0 or7, but in both cases, changing d to1 doesn't work. So, maybe I need to try a=3.

Wait, but that would make N a 4-digit number starting with3, which is smaller than4. But the problem is asking for the greatest such N, so perhaps 4379 is the candidate, but it doesn't satisfy all conditions.

Wait, maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps N is a number where each digit is 1, but that's not possible because N is a four-digit number, but changing any digit to1 would still have multiple digits as1, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another approach: since changing any digit to1 makes the number divisible by7, so N must be such that each of its digits is either 1 or certain values so that changing any digit to1 meets the modulo condition.

Wait, perhaps all digits except one are 1, but that might not be the case.

Wait, let me think again about the equations.

Wait, from equation (C) and (D), we concluded that c must be0 or7.

So, regardless of a, c is 0 or7.

So, with that in mind, perhaps I can consider N as having c=0 or7.

Let me try a=6.

So, a=6.

Equation2:6*6 +3c +d=36 +3c +d≡5 mod7.

36 mod7: 35 is5*7, so 36≡1 mod7.

So, 1 +3c +d≡5 →3c +d≡4 mod7.

Equation3:6*6 +2b +d=36 +2b +d≡4 mod7.

36 mod7=1, so 1 +2b +d ≡4 →2b +d≡3 mod7.

Equation4:6*6 +2b +3c=36 +2b +3c≡6 mod7.

36 mod7=1, so 1 +2b +3c≡6 →2b +3c≡5 mod7.

Equation1:2b +3c +d≡1 mod7.

So, for a=6, equations are:

Equation2:3c +d ≡4 mod7.

Equation3:2b +d ≡3 mod7.

Equation4:2b +3c ≡5 mod7.

Equation1:2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

From equation4:2b +3c=5.

From equation1:5 +d ≡1 →d≡-4≡3 mod7. So, d=3 or10, but d is a digit, so d=3.

From equation2:3c +3≡4 →3c≡1 mod7 →c≡5 mod7 (since 3*5=15≡1 mod7). So c=5 or12, but c is a digit, so c=5.

From equation3:2b +3≡3 →2b≡0 mod7 →b≡0 mod7. So, b=0 or7.

So, b=0 or7.

Now, let's check equation4:2b +3c=2b +15≡2b +1 mod7.

Equation4 requires 2b +1≡5 →2b≡4 →b≡2 mod7. But from equation3, b=0 or7, which are 0≡0 mod7 and7≡0 mod7. So, 2b≡0 mod7, but equation4 requires 2b≡4 mod7. So, 0≡4 mod7? No. Contradiction.

So, no solution for a=6.

Hmm, perhaps a=5.

Equation2:6*5 +3c +d=30 +3c +d≡5 mod7.

30 mod7: 28 is4*7, so 30≡2 mod7.

So, 2 +3c +d≡5 →3c +d≡3 mod7.

Equation3:6*5 +2b +d=30 +2b +d≡4 mod7.

30 mod7=2, so 2 +2b +d≡4 →2b +d≡2 mod7.

Equation4:6*5 +2b +3c=30 +2b +3c≡6 mod7.

30 mod7=2, so 2 +2b +3c≡6 →2b +3c≡4 mod7.

Equation1:2b +3c +d≡1 mod7.

From equation4:2b +3c=4.

From equation1:4 +d≡1 →d≡-3≡4 mod7. So, d=4 or11, but d is a digit, so d=4.

From equation2:3c +4≡3 mod7 →3c≡-1≡6 mod7 →c≡2 mod7 (since 3*2=6). So, c=2 or9.

From equation3:2b +4≡2 →2b≡-2≡5 mod7 →b≡(5*4)=20≡6 mod7 (since 2^{-1}=4 mod7). So, b=6 or13, but b is a digit, so b=6.

Now, check equation4:2b +3c=12 +3c≡12 +3c mod7.

12 mod7=5, so equation4:5 +3c≡4 mod7 →3c≡-1≡6 mod7 →c≡2 mod7. So, c=2 or9.

Which is consistent with what we had.

So, c=2 or9.

So, let's test c=2:

Then, N=5 6 2 4 →5624.

Check if changing each digit to1 gives a multiple of7.

Change a to1:1624. 1624 /7=232, which is 232*7=1624. Good.

Change b to1:5124. 5124 /7=732, which is 732*7=5124. Good.

Change c to1:5614. 5614 /7=802, which is 802*7=5614. Good.

Change d to1:5621. 5621 /7=803, because 803*7=5621. Perfect.

So, 5621 is divisible by7. So, 5624 is a candidate.

Wait, but N is 5624, but wait, when I change d to1, it's 5621, which is divisible by7. So, all four conditions are satisfied.

Similarly, check c=9:

N=5 6 9 4 →5694.

Change a to1:1694. 1694 /7=242, 242*7=1694. Good.

Change b to1:5194. 5194 /7=742, 742*7=5194. Good.

Change c to1:5614, same as before, divisible by7.

Change d to1:5691. 5691 /7=813, 813*7=5691. So, all four conditions are satisfied. So, 5694 is another candidate.

Now, since we need the greatest four-digit number, 5694 is higher than5624. So, 5694 is a better candidate.

But wait, let's check if a can be higher than5. Since a=5 worked, perhaps a=6,7,8,9 can also work.

Wait, earlier attempts with a=6 didn't yield a solution because of contradictions, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine a=6.

Wait, with a=6, the equations led to a contradiction, so a=6 is invalid. So, a=5 is the highest possible.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me check a=6 again.

Wait, when a=6, we had:

From equation4:2b +3c≡5 mod7.

From equation1:2b +3c +d≡1 mod7 → equation1:5 +d≡1 →d= -4≡3 mod7.

So, d=3.

Then, equation2:3c +3≡4 mod7 →3c=1 mod7 →c=5 mod7.

So, c=5 or12, but c=5.

Equation3:2b +3≡2 mod7 →2b= -1≡6 mod7 →b=3 mod7.

So, b=3 or10, but b=3.

Now, equation4:2b +3c=6 +15=21≡0 mod7. But equation4 requires it to be≡5 mod7. 0≡5? No. So, no solution.

So, a=6 is invalid.

So, a=5 is the highest possible.

So, the candidates are N=5694 and5624.

Since 5694 is higher, and it satisfies all four conditions, that's our N.

So, N=5694.

Then, Q is the quotient when N is divided by1000, so 5694 /1000=5 with remainder 694.

So, Q=5, R=694. Then, Q + R=5 +694=699.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check if N=5694 is the greatest possible.

Is there a higher four-digit number with this property?

Wait, a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4. Is there a higher number with a=5, maybe b=7,8,9? Let me check.

Wait, let me see if there's a higher number than5694 with the same a=5, but higher b, c, d.

Wait, but when a=5, according to our earlier equations, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the only solution when c=9, since c must be2 or9, but with a=5, c=9.

Wait, but wait, when a=5, c can be2 or9.

Wait, earlier, when a=5, c=2 gives N=5624, and c=9 gives N=5694.

So, 5694 is higher.

But maybe there's a higher N with a=5, but with higher digits in b, c, d.

Wait, but according to the equations, when a=5, the only possible b is6, c is2 or9, d is4.

So, 5694 is the highest possible when a=5.

But maybe a=5 is not the maximum possible a.

Wait, earlier attempts with a=6,7,8,9 didn't yield solutions because of contradictions, so 5 is the highest possible a.

Thus, N=5694 is the greatest four-digit number satisfying the given condition.

Therefore, Q=5, R=694, and Q + R=5 +694=699.


--- Final Answer Content ---


Now, let's provide the step-by-step explanation and the final answer.

---

To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Then, we compute \( Q + R \) where \( Q \) is the quotient and \( R \) is the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - \( N \) is a four-digit number, i.e., \( 1000 \leq N \leq 9999 \).
   - Changing any single digit of \( N \) to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.

2. **Mathematical Representation:**
   - Let \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \) where \( a, b, c, d \) are digits (0-9) and \( a \neq 0 \).
   - When any digit is changed to 1, the resulting number must be divisible by 7. This gives four conditions:
     1. \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     2. \( 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     3. \( 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     4. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)

3. **Simplifying Using Modulo 7:**
   - Compute powers of 10 modulo 7: \( 10^3 \equiv 6 \), \( 10^2 \equiv 2 \), \( 10^1 \equiv 3 \), \( 10^0 \equiv 1 \).
   - The conditions become:
     1. \( 6 + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     2. \( 6a + 2 + 3c + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     3. \( 6a + 2b + 3 + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     4. \( 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)

4. **Solving the System of Congruences:**
   - By analyzing the equations, we find that \( c \) must be either 0 or 7.
   - Testing possible values for \( a, b, c, d \) systematically, we find that the highest valid \( N \) is 5694.

5. **Verification:**
   - Changing each digit of 5694 to 1:
     - \( 1694 \div 7 = 242 \) (exact division)
     - \( 5194 \div 7 = 742 \) (exact division)
     - \( 5614 \div 7 = 802 \) (exact division)
     - \( 5691 \div 7 = 813 \) (exact division)
   - All conditions are satisfied.

6. **Computing \( Q \) and \( R \):**
   - \( N = 5694 \)
   - \( Q = 5 \) (quotient when divided by 1000)
   - \( R = 694 \) (remainder)
   - \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \)

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{699}
