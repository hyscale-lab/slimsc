Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the problem states that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. And we need to find the product xy.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember some properties that might help here. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's translate the logarithmic equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle. 

The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the logarithm power rule, which says that log_b(a^n) = n*log_b(a), this can be rewritten as x * log_x(y) = 10.

But wait, log_x(y) is just the exponent to which we need to raise x to get y. Let me denote that as a variable to make things simpler. Let's let a = log_x(y). Then the equation becomes x * a = 10. So, equation 1: x * a = 10.

Now, moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, using the power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Similarly, log_y(x) is the exponent to which we need to raise y to get x. Let me denote that as another variable, let's say b = log_y(x). So, equation 2 becomes 4y * b = 10.

But wait, I know that a and b are related because they're logarithms of each other's bases. Specifically, since a = log_x(y), that means y = x^a. And since b = log_y(x), that means x = y^b. So, substituting y from the first into the second, x = (x^a)^b = x^{a*b}. 

This implies that x^{a*b} = x^1, right? Since x is greater than 1, the exponents must be equal. So, a*b = 1. That gives me a relationship between a and b: a * b = 1.

So, now I have:

1. x * a = 10
2. 4y * b = 10
3. a * b = 1

And also, from the definitions, y = x^a and x = y^b.

Hmm, let's see. Since a * b = 1, I can express b as 1/a. So, b = 1/a.

Substituting b into equation 2: 4y * (1/a) = 10.

But from equation 1, x * a =10, so a =10/x. Therefore, 1/a = x/10.

Substituting 1/a into equation 2: 4y * (x/10) =10.

Simplify that: (4xy)/10 =10. Multiply both sides by 10: 4xy = 100. Divide both sides by 4: xy = 25.

Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure I haven't made a mistake.

So, if xy=25, then the product is 25. But let me check by finding the values of x and y to ensure consistency.

From equation 1: x * a =10, and since a = log_x(y), y =x^a. Also, from equation 3, a*b=1, and b = log_y(x). 

But since x = y^b, substituting y gives x = (x^a)^b =x^{ab}=x^1, which is consistent because ab=1.

So, using equation 1: x * a =10, and equation 2: 4y * b =10, and ab=1.

We found that xy=25. Let's try to express x and y in terms of a.

From equation 1: x=10/a.

From y = x^a: y=(10/a)^a.

But we also have from equation 2: 4y * b =10. Since b=1/a, this becomes 4y*(1/a)=10.

Substitute y: 4*(10/a)^a*(1/a)=10.

Simplify: 4*(10^a)/(a^{a+1}) )=10.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can find a value for a that satisfies this equation.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use substitution with the expressions for x and y.

Wait, maybe we can avoid getting into more complex equations by using the fact that xy=25.

If xy=25, then y=25/x.

So, let's substitute that into the original equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x)=10. Let's compute y^x. y=25/x, so y^x=(25/x)^x.

So, log_x( (25/x)^x )=10.

Using the power rule, this becomes x * log_x(25/x) =10.

Which simplifies to x*( log_x(25) - log_x(x) ) =10.

Since log_x(x)=1, this becomes x*( log_x(25) -1 )=10.

So, x*log_x(25) -x =10.

But log_x(25) is equal to ln(25)/ln(x), using change of base formula.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, let me consider expressing both x and y in terms of a single variable.

Wait, since ab=1, and from equation 1, a=10/x, and from equation 2, b=10/(4y).

So, a*b = (10/x)*(10/(4y)) = 100/(4xy) =25/(xy)=1.

So, 25/(xy)=1 => xy=25.

So, that's another way to get xy=25. Therefore, the product is 25.

I think that's consistent. So, regardless of the approach, I get that xy=25.

Therefore, the answer should be 25.

The problem involves finding real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), both greater than 1, such that \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). We aim to determine the product \( xy \).

First, we use the logarithm power rule to rewrite the given equations:
- \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) becomes \( x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10 \).
- \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \) becomes \( 4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10 \).

Let \( a = \log_x(y) \) and \( b = \log_y(x) \). Then:
1. \( x \cdot a = 10 \)
2. \( 4y \cdot b = 10 \)
3. \( a \cdot b = 1 \) (since \( y = x^a \) and \( x = y^b \), leading to \( a \cdot b = 1 \))

From equation 3, \( b = \frac{1}{a} \). Substituting \( b \) into equation 2:
\[ 4y \cdot \frac{1}{a} = 10 \]
\[ \frac{4y}{a} = 10 \]
\[ \frac{4y}{a} = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{y}{a} = \frac{10}{4} = \frac{5}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = \frac{5}{2}a \]

From equation 1, \( x = \frac{10}{a} \). Substituting \( x \) and \( y \) into the product \( xy \):
\[ xy = \left(\frac{10}{a}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{5}{2}a\right) = \frac{10 \cdot 5}{2} = 25 \]

Thus, the product \( xy \) is \( 25 \).

\[
\boxed{25}
\]
