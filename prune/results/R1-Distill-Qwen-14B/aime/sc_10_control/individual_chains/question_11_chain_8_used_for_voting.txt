Okay, so I have this complex problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem is: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \).

Hmm, so I need to maximize the real part of this expression with respect to \( z \), given that the magnitude of \( z \) is 4. Alright, let's break this down.

First, since \( |z| = 4 \), I can represent \( z \) in polar form. Let me write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). This might make it easier to handle because the magnitude is fixed, and I can express everything in terms of \( \theta \).

So, substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression, let's compute each term.

First term: \((75 + 117i)z\)

That would be \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \).

Let me compute the multiplication: \( 75 \times 4 = 300 \), and \( 117 \times 4 = 468 \). So the first term becomes \( (300 + 468i) e^{i\theta} \).

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \)

Since \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), \( 1/z = \frac{1}{4} e^{-i\theta} \). So this term becomes \( (96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4} e^{-i\theta} \).

Calculating the scalar multiplication: \( 96 \times \frac{1}{4} = 24 \), \( 144 \times \frac{1}{4} = 36 \). So this term is \( (24 + 36i) e^{-i\theta} \).

So the entire expression becomes:

\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \)

Now, let's express these exponentials in terms of cosine and sine to find the real part.

Recall that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, expand \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \):

Multiply out the terms:

= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2 \sin\theta

Remember that \( i^2 = -1 \), so the last term becomes -468 sin\theta.

So, grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ

Imaginary part: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ

Similarly, expand \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \):

Multiply out the terms:

= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ

Again, \( i^2 = -1 \), so the last term becomes +36 sinθ.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

Imaginary part: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i

Now, adding the two expanded expressions:

First, the real parts from both expressions:

From first term: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ

From second term: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

Adding these together:

Real part total = (300 cosθ + 24 cosθ) + (-468 sinθ + 36 sinθ)

= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Similarly, the imaginary parts:

From first term: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ

From second term: -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ

Adding these together:

Imaginary part total = (300 sinθ - 24 sinθ) + (468 cosθ + 36 cosθ)

= 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ

But since we're only interested in the real part of the entire expression, we can focus on the real part total, which is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, our goal is to maximize the expression \( 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \).

This is a standard maximization problem for an expression of the form \( A \cos\theta + B \sin\theta \), where the maximum value is \( \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \). Wait, but in our case, it's \( A \cosθ + B \sinθ \), but our expression is \( 324 \cosθ - 432 \sinθ \), which is the same as \( 324 \cosθ + (-432) \sinθ \). So, yes, same form.

So the maximum value is \( \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324^2 and 432^2.

324^2: 324 * 324.

Hmm, 300^2 = 90,000, 24^2=576, and 2*300*24=14,400.

So, (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Wait, but 324 is 18^2, so 324^2 = (18^2)^2 = 18^4. Hmm, but I can just compute 324 * 324.

Let me compute 324 * 300 = 97,200, and 324 * 24. 324 * 20 = 6,480, 324 *4=1,296. So 6,480 +1,296=7,776. So total 97,200 +7,776=104,976. Yep, same as before.

Now, 432^2: 432 * 432.

Let me compute 400^2 =160,000, 32^2=1,024, and 2*400*32=25,600.

So, (400 +32)^2 =400^2 +2*400*32 +32^2=160,000 +25,600 +1,024= 186,624.

But wait, 432 is 400 + 32, so 432^2=186,624.

So, our expression's maximum is sqrt(104,976 + 186,624).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, our expression is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. So A is 324, B is -432, but when computing the magnitude, it's sqrt(A^2 + B^2) regardless of the sign.

So sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624).

Let's compute that sum.

104,976 + 186,624.

104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

So sqrt(291,600).

What is sqrt(291,600)?

Well, 500^2 = 250,000, 600^2 = 360,000. So between 500 and 600.

540^2= (54)^2 *100^2= 2916 *10,000=29,160,000, which is way bigger. Wait, no, 540^2 is 291,600? Wait, 540*540.

Wait, 500^2=250,000, 40^2=1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000. So, (500+40)^2= 500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2=250,000 +40,000+1,600= 291,600. Yes, correct.

So sqrt(291,600)=540.

So the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So the maximum real part is 540.

But wait, let me double-check my steps to be sure.

1. Expressed z as 4e^{iθ} because |z|=4.

2. Expanded both terms, multiplied out, and then separated real and imaginary parts.

3. Found the real part as 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

4. Recognized that the maximum is sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) =540.

So that should be correct.

But wait, another way to think about it is to represent the expression as a single sinusoid.

Let me see: 324 cosθ -432 sinθ can be written as R cos(θ + φ), where R is sqrt(324^2 +432^2) and φ is some phase shift. The maximum value of this is R, which is 540. So that's consistent.

Alternatively, if I think of the expression as a dot product, where the vector (324, -432) is dotted with (cosθ, sinθ), the maximum value is the magnitude of the vector, which again is 540.

So, yes, that makes sense.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes earlier.

324^2 is 104,976, and 432^2 is 186,624. Adding them together: 104,976 +186,624.

104,976 + 186,624: Let's add 100,000 + 180,000=280,000. Then 4,976 +6,624=11,600. So total 280,000 +11,600=291,600. So sqrt(291,600)=540. Correct.

So the maximum real part is 540. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't miss anything in the problem statement. It's about the real part of the expression, which is correct. And z is a complex number with |z|=4, which I handled by setting z=4e^{iθ}.

So yes, all steps seem correct.

To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \( |z| = 4 \), we start by expressing \( z \) in polar form as \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). Substituting this into the expression, we compute each term:

1. **First Term**: \((75 + 117i)z = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta}\)
2. **Second Term**: \(\frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}\)

Expanding these using Euler's formula and combining real parts, we get the real part of the entire expression as:
\[ 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \]

To maximize this expression, we recognize it as \( A \cos\theta + B \sin\theta \) with \( A = 324 \) and \( B = -432 \). The maximum value is given by the magnitude \( \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \):
\[ \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104,976 + 186,624} = \sqrt{291,600} = 540 \]

Thus, the largest possible real part is:

\[
\boxed{540}
\]
