Okay, so I have this problem here about points O, A, and B on a coordinate plane. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). There's a family of segments F, which are all PQ segments of unit length in the first quadrant. Each P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. 

The main goal is to find a point C on AB, which is distinct from A and B, that isn't on any other segment from F except for AB itself. Then, I need to find OC squared, which will be a fraction p/q, and then compute p + q.

Let me try to visualize this. Points A and B are on the axes, and AB is a line segment connecting them. Since A is at (1/2, 0) and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), the line AB will have a certain slope. I can compute the equation of line AB to help with this.

First, let's find the equation of AB. The coordinates of A are (1/2, 0) and B are (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope (m) of AB is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). 

So, the slope of AB is -sqrt(3). Using point-slope form, let's write the equation. Let's use point A: y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, any point C on AB can be parameterized as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2). Alternatively, since it's a line segment, x will range from 0 to 1/2.

Now, the family F consists of segments PQ of unit length with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the length of PQ is 1.

Let me recall that the length of PQ is sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1, so p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, all such segments PQ are in the first quadrant, connecting (p,0) to (0,q), where p and q satisfy p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Now, any such segment PQ can be represented parametrically. The equation of PQ can be found using the two points (p,0) and (0,q). The equation is x/p + y/q = 1.

So, the equation is x/p + y/q = 1, where p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So, for each PQ in F, we have a line x/p + y/q = 1 with p^2 + q^2 =1.

Now, the point C is on AB, and it's the unique point on AB (other than A and B) that is not on any other PQ from F except AB itself. So, C is on AB, but not on any other segment PQ in F.

Wait, but AB itself is a segment PQ in F? Let me check. The points A are at (1/2, 0) and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the length of AB is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment of unit length, so it is part of the family F.

Therefore, AB is one of the segments in F, and any other point on AB (other than A and B) might lie on another PQ segment in F. But there is a unique point C on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ in F.

So, C is on AB, and for every other PQ in F (other than AB), C is not on PQ. We need to find such a point C.

So, perhaps C is the point on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ from F except AB. So, if we can find such a point, then we can compute OC^2.

To find C, we can think about the envelope of all these segments PQ in F. The envelope is the curve that is tangent to all these segments. So, points on the envelope are only intersected by exactly one segment from F. Since AB is part of F, the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F. So, the envelope of F is the curve that is tangent to all the segments PQ in F, and AB is tangent to this envelope at point C.

So, to find C, we can find the envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q =1 with p^2 + q^2=1, and then find where AB is tangent to this envelope.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the lines in F and then find their envelope.

Let me try to parametrize the family. Since p^2 + q^2 =1, we can parametrize p and q in terms of an angle θ. Let me set p = cosθ, q = sinθ, since p and q are positive (as we're in the first quadrant), so θ will be between 0 and π/2.

Then, the equation of PQ becomes x/cosθ + y/sinθ =1.

So, we can think of this as a family of lines parameterized by θ, with θ ∈ (0, π/2).

Now, the envelope of this family can be found using the method for finding envelopes of a family of curves.

The envelope satisfies both the equation of the curve and the derivative with respect to the parameter set to zero.

So, given F(x, y, θ) = x/cosθ + y/sinθ -1 = 0.

Compute dF/dθ and set it to zero.

So, compute dF/dθ.

dF/dθ = ( -x sinθ / cos²θ ) + ( -y cosθ / sin²θ ) = 0.

So,

(-x sinθ)/cos²θ - (y cosθ)/sin²θ = 0

Let me write this as:

x sinθ / cos²θ + y cosθ / sin²θ = 0

But maybe it's better to write in terms of the original equation.

Wait, no, dF/dθ = 0, so:

(-x sinθ)/cos²θ - (y cosθ)/sin²θ = 0.

So,

(-x sinθ)/cos²θ = (y cosθ)/sin²θ

Multiply both sides by cos²θ sin²θ:

(-x sinθ)(sin²θ) = (y cosθ)(cos²θ)

So,

- x sin^3θ = y cos^3θ

Therefore,

y = (-x sin^3θ) / cos^3θ = -x tan^3θ.

So, y = -x tan^3θ.

But we also have the original equation F(x, y, θ) = x/cosθ + y/sinθ -1 =0.

So, substituting y from above into this equation.

So,

x/cosθ + (-x tan^3θ)/sinθ -1=0.

Simplify:

x/cosθ - x tan^3θ / sinθ =1.

Note that tanθ = sinθ / cosθ, so tan^3θ = sin^3θ / cos^3θ.

So,

x/cosθ - x (sin^3θ / cos^3θ) / sinθ =1.

Simplify the second term: (sin^3θ / cos^3θ) / sinθ = sin²θ / cos^3θ.

So,

x/cosθ - x sin²θ / cos^3θ =1.

Factor x:

x (1/cosθ - sin²θ / cos^3θ ) =1.

Let's compute the term in the parenthesis:

1/cosθ - sin²θ / cos^3θ = (cos²θ - sin²θ) / cos^3θ.

Because, 1/cosθ = cos²θ / cos^3θ.

So,

= (cos²θ - sin²θ) / cos^3θ.

Therefore, x * (cos²θ - sin²θ) / cos^3θ =1.

So,

x = [cos^3θ] / (cos²θ - sin²θ).

Similarly, from the expression of y,

y = -x tan^3θ = - [cos^3θ / (cos²θ - sin²θ)] * (sin^3θ / cos^3θ) )

Wait, let me compute that:

y = -x tan^3θ = -x (sin^3θ / cos^3θ) = - [cos^3θ / (cos²θ - sin²θ)] * (sin^3θ / cos^3θ) 

The cos^3θ in numerator and denominator cancel:

y = - [ sin^3θ / (cos²θ - sin²θ) ]

So, y = - sin^3θ / (cos²θ - sin²θ )

So, we have expressions for x and y in terms of θ.

So, the envelope is the parametric curve:

x = cos^3θ / (cos²θ - sin²θ )

y = - sin^3θ / (cos²θ - sin²θ )

But wait, since θ is in (0, π/2), cos²θ - sin²θ is positive when cos²θ > sin²θ, which is when θ < 45 degrees (π/4), and negative when θ > 45 degrees.

Wait, but the denominator cos²θ - sin²θ is equal to cos(2θ). So, when θ < π/4, cos(2θ) is positive, and when θ > π/4, cos(2θ) is negative.

So, for θ ∈ (0, π/4), cos²θ - sin²θ >0, so x and y are positive, which makes sense because the envelope is in the first quadrant.

For θ ∈ (π/4, π/2), cos²θ - sin²θ <0, but in our case, we are considering PQ segments in the first quadrant, so maybe the envelope only exists for θ < π/4? Or perhaps it's symmetric.

Wait, perhaps I need to analyze this parametric equation more carefully.

But perhaps it's easier to express the envelope in terms of x and y without θ.

Alternatively, let's see if we can find a relationship between x and y.

From the parametric equations:

x = cos^3θ / (cos(2θ)) 

Because cos²θ - sin²θ = cos(2θ)

Similarly,

y = - sin^3θ / cos(2θ)

So,

x = cos^3θ / cos(2θ)

y = - sin^3θ / cos(2θ)

We can write these as:

x = [cosθ * cos²θ ] / cos(2θ)

Similarly, y = - [sinθ * sin²θ ] / cos(2θ)

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let's express in terms of t = tanθ. Let t = tanθ, so sinθ = t / sqrt(1 + t²), cosθ = 1 / sqrt(1 + t²).

Then, cos(2θ) = (1 - t²)/(1 + t²).

So, let's compute x:

x = [ (1 / sqrt(1 + t²))^3 ] / [ (1 - t²)/(1 + t²) ) ]

Simplify numerator: (1 + t²)^(-3/2 )

Denominator: (1 - t²)/(1 + t²) = (1 - t²)(1 + t²)^(-1)

So, x = [ (1 + t²)^(-3/2) ] / [ (1 - t²)(1 + t²)^(-1) ) ] = (1 + t²)^(-3/2) * (1 + t²) / (1 - t²) ) = (1 + t²)^(-1/2) / (1 - t²)

Similarly, y = - [ ( t^3 / (1 + t²)^(3/2) ) ] / [ (1 - t²)/(1 + t²) ) ]

Which is:

= - [ t^3 / (1 + t²)^(3/2) ) ] * [ (1 + t²)/(1 - t²) ) ] = - [ t^3 / (1 + t²)^(1/2) ) ] / (1 - t² )

So, both x and y can be expressed in terms of t, where t = tanθ.

So, x = 1 / [ (1 + t²)^(1/2) (1 - t²) ) ] 

Wait, let me re-express x and y:

x = (1 + t²)^(-1/2) / (1 - t²) 

y = - t^3 (1 + t²)^(-1/2) / (1 - t² )

Hmm, perhaps it's better to square x and y to find a relation.

Wait, let's see:

Let me denote u = t².

Then, x = 1 / [ sqrt(1 + u) (1 - u) ) ]

Similarly, y = - u^(3/2) / [ sqrt(1 + u) (1 - u) ) ]

But this might not be the easiest path.

Alternatively, let's try to find a relationship between x and y.

From the parametric expressions:

x = cos^3θ / cos(2θ)

y = - sin^3θ / cos(2θ)

Let's divide y by x:

y/x = - sin^3θ / cos^3θ = - tan^3θ

So, tanθ = (- y/x )^(1/3 )

But maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps express sinθ and cosθ in terms of x and y.

Wait, we have:

From x = cos^3θ / cos(2θ )

And y = - sin^3θ / cos(2θ )

Let me denote D = cos(2θ ), so

x = cos^3θ / D

y = - sin^3θ / D

So,

x = cos^3θ / D

y = - sin^3θ / D

We can express cos^3theta as x D, and sin^3theta as - y D.

So,

cos^3theta = x D,

sin^3theta = - y D.

Also, since cos^2theta + sin^2theta =1,

cos^2theta = (x D)^{2/3} ?

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think differently.

We can write cos theta = (x D )^{1/3}

Similarly, sin theta = (- y D )^{1/3}

But wait, sin theta is positive in (0, pi/2), but y is negative in our parametric equations, because y = - sin^3theta / D. So, if D is positive (for theta < pi/4), then y is negative. Hmm.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can find a relation between x and y.

Let me consider that from the above, we have:

From the parametric equations,

x = cos^3θ / cos(2θ )

y = - sin^3θ / cos(2θ )

So, let me express everything in terms of sinθ and cosθ.

Let me denote s = sinθ, c = cosθ.

So, x = c^3 / (c^2 - s^2 )

y = - s^3 / (c^2 - s^2 )

We can write this as:

x = c^3 / (cos(2θ)) [since c² - s² = cos(2θ)]

Similarly, y = -s^3 / cos(2θ )

So,

x = c^3 / cos(2θ)

y = -s^3 / cos(2θ )

Let me write these as:

x = c^3 / cos(2θ)

y = -s^3 / cos(2θ )

Let me solve for c and s in terms of x and y.

From the first equation: c^3 = x cos(2θ )

From the second: s^3 = - y cos(2θ )

But we also know that c² + s² =1.

Let me express c^6 and s^6.

But perhaps instead, take the ratio of x and y:

x / y = (c^3 / cos(2θ )) / ( - s^3 / cos(2θ )) ) = - (c^3 / s^3 ) = - (c/s)^3

So, x/y = - (c/s)^3, which implies (c/s)^3 = -x/y

So, c/s = (-x/y )^{1/3 }

But c/s = cotθ, so cotθ = (-x/y )^{1/3 }

So, tanθ = [ (-y/x ) ]^{1/3 }

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let me think about squaring x and y.

Wait, perhaps express x and y in terms of t = tanθ.

Let t = tanθ, so sinθ = t / sqrt(1 + t²), cosθ = 1 / sqrt(1 + t²).

So, cos(2θ) = (1 - t²)/(1 + t²).

So, compute x:

x = [ (1 / sqrt(1 + t²) )^3 ] / [ (1 - t²)/(1 + t²) ) ]

= [ 1 / (1 + t² )^(3/2) ) ] / [ (1 - t²)/(1 + t²) ) ]

= [1] / [ (1 + t² )^(3/2) * (1 - t²)/(1 + t²) ) ]

= (1 + t² ) / [ (1 + t² )^(3/2) (1 - t²) ) ]

= 1 / [ (1 + t² )^(1/2) (1 - t²) ) ]

Similarly, y:

y = - [ ( t^3 / (1 + t² )^(3/2) ) ] / [ (1 - t²)/(1 + t²) ) ]

= - [ t^3 / (1 + t² )^(3/2) ] * [ (1 + t² ) / (1 - t² ) ]

= - [ t^3 / (1 + t² )^(1/2) ) ] / (1 - t² )

So, x and y are expressed in terms of t.

Let me denote:

x = 1 / [ sqrt(1 + t² ) (1 - t² ) ]

y = - t^3 / [ sqrt(1 + t² ) (1 - t² ) ]

So, from x, we can write sqrt(1 + t² ) = 1/(x (1 - t² ) )

But let me square both sides:

x^2 = 1 / [ (1 + t² ) (1 - t² )^2 ]

Similarly, y^2 = t^6 / [ (1 + t² ) (1 - t² )^2 ]

So, if I take the ratio y^2 / x^2, I get:

y^2 / x^2 = t^6 / 1 = t^6

So, t^6 = (y^2 / x^2 )

Thus, t^3 = ± y / x

But since t = tanθ is positive (θ in (0, pi/2)), t^3 is positive. So, t^3 = | y / x |.

Wait, but in our case, y is negative because for θ in (0, pi/4), cos(2θ) is positive, so y is negative. So, y is negative, x is positive, so y/x is negative, so t^3 = | y / x | = - y / x.

Therefore, t^3 = - y / x.

So, from this, t = [ - y / x ]^{1/3 }

So, let me substitute t into the equation for x.

We have:

x = 1 / [ sqrt(1 + t² ) (1 - t² ) ]

Let me express sqrt(1 + t^2 ) as sqrt(1 + t^2 ) = sqrt( (1 + t^2 ) )

But from t^3 = - y / x, we can write t^2 = [ (- y / x )^{1/3} ]^2 = [ (- y / x ) ]^{2/3 }

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to express in terms of t.

Alternatively, let's express 1 + t² and 1 - t² in terms of x and y.

Wait, let me think of t as a variable, and express 1 + t² = a, and 1 - t² = b.

But maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, let's express x in terms of t:

x = 1 / [ sqrt(1 + t² ) (1 - t² ) ] 

Let me square both sides:

x^2 = 1 / [ (1 + t² ) (1 - t² )^2 ]

Which can be written as:

(1 + t² ) (1 - t² )^2 = 1 / x^2

Similarly, y can be expressed as:

y = - t^3 / [ sqrt(1 + t² ) (1 - t² ) ]

So, let me compute y^2:

y^2 = t^6 / [ (1 + t² ) (1 - t² )^2 ]

But from above, (1 + t² ) (1 - t² )^2 = 1 / x^2.

So, y^2 = t^6 * x^2.

But t^6 = (t^3)^2 = [ - y / x ]^2 = y^2 / x^2.

So, y^2 = (y^2 / x^2) * x^2 = y^2.

Which is an identity, so that doesn't help.

Alternatively, let's express x and y in terms of t.

Wait, perhaps we can find a relation between x and y.

From x and y expressions:

x = 1 / [ sqrt(1 + t² ) (1 - t² ) ]

y = - t^3 / [ sqrt(1 + t² ) (1 - t² ) ]

Let me write sqrt(1 + t² ) (1 - t² ) as D.

Then,

x = 1 / D

y = - t^3 / D

So,

D = 1/x

And,

y = - t^3 D

Substituting D = 1/x, we get:

y = - t^3 / x

So,

t^3 = - x y

But earlier, we had t^3 = - y / x. Wait, which seems conflicting. Wait, let me check.

Wait, no, let me see:

Wait, from the parametric equations, we had t^3 = - y / x.

But here, from D=1/x, and y = - t^3 D = - t^3 (1/x )

So, y = - t^3 / x → t^3 = - x y.

Wait, but earlier we had t^3 = - y / x.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, in the parametric equations:

We have y = - t^3 / D, and D = sqrt(1 + t^2 ) (1 - t^2 )

Which is:

y = - t^3 / [ sqrt(1 + t^2 ) (1 - t^2 ) ]

And,

x = 1 / [ sqrt(1 + t^2 ) (1 - t^2 ) ]

So,

y = - t^3 x

So,

y = - t^3 x → t^3 = - y / x

Which is consistent with earlier.

So, t^3 = - y / x

But from D=1/x, t^3 is also equal to - y x ?

Wait, no, D=1/x, so D=1/x, which is sqrt(1 + t^2 ) (1 - t^2 )=1/x.

Wait, perhaps I can express in terms of x and y.

Wait, since t^3 = - y / x, so t = (- y / x )^{1/3 }

Let me substitute into D.

So,

D = sqrt(1 + t^2 ) (1 - t^2 ) = 1/x.

Let me compute sqrt(1 + t^2 ) (1 - t^2 ) in terms of t.

Let me set t = (- y / x )^{1/3 }, so t^3 = - y / x.

Let me express 1 + t^2 and 1 - t^2.

1 + t^2 = 1 + t^2

1 - t^2 = 1 - t^2

So, their product:

sqrt(1 + t^2 ) * (1 - t^2 ) = sqrt( (1 + t^2 ) (1 - t^2 )^2 )

Let me compute (1 + t^2 )(1 - t^2 )^2.

= (1 + t^2 )(1 - 2 t^2 + t^4 )

= 1*(1 - 2 t^2 + t^4 ) + t^2 (1 - 2 t^2 + t^4 )

= 1 - 2 t^2 + t^4 + t^2 - 2 t^4 + t^6

= 1 - t^2 - t^4 + t^6

Hmm.

But this seems getting too involved. Maybe it's better to find the equation of the envelope without parametrizing.

Wait, another approach: The envelope of the family F: x/p + y/q =1, where p^2 + q^2 =1.

So, to find the envelope, we can use the method of solving for the envelope.

We can write F(x, y, p) = x/p + y/q -1 =0, with the condition p^2 + q^2 =1.

But since p and q are related, we can use Lagrange multipliers or similar.

Alternatively, think of q as sqrt(1 - p^2 ), since p^2 + q^2 =1.

So, substitute q = sqrt(1 - p^2 ) into the equation.

So, F(x, y, p) = x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p^2 ) -1 =0.

Now, to find the envelope, we can treat this as an equation in p, and find where the derivative with respect to p is zero.

Wait, but this is a method to find where F and dF/dp =0.

So, compute dF/dp = 0.

Compute dF/dp:

dF/dp = -x / p^2 + ( y * p ) / ( (1 - p^2 )^(3/2 ) ) =0.

So,

- x / p^2 + ( y p ) / (1 - p^2 )^(3/2 ) = 0

Multiply both sides by p^2 (1 - p^2 )^(3/2 ) to eliminate denominators:

- x (1 - p^2 )^(3/2 ) + y p^3 =0

So,

y p^3 = x (1 - p^2 )^(3/2 )

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

y^2 p^6 = x^2 (1 - p^2 )^3

Let me rearrange:

y^2 p^6 = x^2 (1 - 3 p^2 + 3 p^4 - p^6 )

Bring all terms to one side:

y^2 p^6 - x^2 + 3 x^2 p^2 - 3 x^2 p^4 + x^2 p^6 =0

Factor terms:

p^6 (y^2 + x^2 ) + p^4 (-3 x^2 ) + p^2 (3 x^2 ) - x^2 =0

Let me set u = p^2, so:

(y^2 + x^2 ) u^3 - 3 x^2 u^2 + 3 x^2 u - x^2 =0

So,

(y^2 + x^2 ) u^3 - 3 x^2 u^2 + 3 x^2 u - x^2 =0

This is a cubic equation in u.

But solving this seems complicated. Maybe we can find an expression relating x and y.

Alternatively, perhaps think of this as a cubic in u.

But perhaps another approach: Since we know that the envelope is tangent to AB at point C, so point C lies on both AB and the envelope.

Since AB is the line y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, point C is (h, -sqrt(3) h + sqrt(3)/2 ) for some h between 0 and 1/2.

We need to find h such that this point C lies on the envelope.

So, substituting y = -sqrt(3) h + sqrt(3)/2 into the envelope equation.

But the envelope equation is the relation we obtained earlier, which is:

y^2 p^6 = x^2 (1 - p^2 )^3

But wait, perhaps using the equation for the envelope that we derived earlier, which was F(x, y, p)=0 and dF/dp=0.

But it's complicated. Alternatively, since C lies on the envelope, it must satisfy the condition that the distance from C to the line PQ is zero, but for the envelope, it's tangent, so the system has a double root.

Alternatively, perhaps using duality.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The envelope is the astroid.

Wait, the family of lines x/p + y/q =1, with p^2 + q^2=1, is known to form an astroid as their envelope.

Yes, the envelope is the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1.

Wait, is that correct?

Let me recall, the envelope of x/p + y/q =1 with p^2 + q^2=1 is indeed the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.

So, that's a known result. So, the envelope is the astroid given by x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1.

Therefore, point C lies on both AB and the astroid.

So, we can find C as the intersection point of AB and the astroid, other than A and B.

So, the astroid equation is x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.

And AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, let's substitute y from AB into the astroid equation.

So,

x^{2/3} + ( -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 )^{2/3} =1

This seems tricky to solve, but perhaps we can let t = x^{1/3}, and similar for y.

Alternatively, let's make a substitution to simplify.

Let me denote u = x^{1/3}, v = y^{1/3}.

Then, the astroid equation becomes u^2 + v^2 =1.

And AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Expressed in terms of u and v:

v^3 = -sqrt(3) u^3 + sqrt(3)/2

So,

v^3 + sqrt(3) u^3 = sqrt(3)/2

But we also have u^2 + v^2 =1.

Hmm, this might be a better way to approach.

We have two equations:

1. u^2 + v^2 =1

2. v^3 + sqrt(3) u^3 = sqrt(3)/2

We can try to solve these equations for u and v.

Let me express equation 2 as:

v^3 = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) u^3

So,

v^3 = sqrt(3) (1/2 - u^3 )

Let me cube both sides:

v^9 = [ sqrt(3) (1/2 - u^3 ) ]^3

But that seems messy. Maybe a better approach.

Alternatively, express v from equation 1 in terms of u, then substitute into equation 2.

From equation 1:

v = sqrt(1 - u^2 )

Substitute into equation 2:

[ sqrt(1 - u^2 ) ]^3 + sqrt(3) u^3 = sqrt(3)/2

So,

(1 - u^2 )^{3/2} + sqrt(3) u^3 = sqrt(3)/2

Let me denote t = u^2.

So, u = sqrt(t ), and 1 - u^2 =1 - t.

So,

(1 - t )^{3/2} + sqrt(3) (t )^{3/2} = sqrt(3)/2

So,

(1 - t )^{3/2} + sqrt(3) t^{3/2} = sqrt(3)/2

Hmm, this is a complicated equation in t, but maybe we can find a substitution.

Let me rearrange:

(1 - t )^{3/2} = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t^{3/2 }

Factor sqrt(3):

= sqrt(3) [ 1/2 - t^{3/2} ]

So,

(1 - t )^{3/2} = sqrt(3) [ 1/2 - t^{3/2} ]

Square both sides to eliminate the square roots:

[ (1 - t )^{3/2} ]^2 = [ sqrt(3) (1/2 - t^{3/2} ) ]^2

So,

(1 - t )^3 = 3 (1/2 - t^{3/2} )^2

Expand the left side:

1 - 3 t + 3 t^2 - t^3

Right side:

3 [ (1/2)^2 - 2*(1/2)*t^{3/2} + t^3 ]

=3 [ 1/4 - t^{3/2} + t^3 ]

= 3/4 - 3 t^{3/2} + 3 t^3

So, equation:

1 -3 t + 3 t^2 - t^3 = 3/4 - 3 t^{3/2} + 3 t^3

Bring all terms to left side:

1 -3 t +3 t^2 - t^3 -3/4 +3 t^{3/2} -3 t^3 =0

Simplify:

(1 - 3/4) -3 t +3 t^2 + (-t^3 -3 t^3 ) +3 t^{3/2}=0

= 1/4 -3 t +3 t^2 -4 t^3 +3 t^{3/2}=0

Hmm, this seems quite complicated. Perhaps we can make another substitution.

Let me set s = sqrt(t ), so t = s^2, t^{3/2}=s^3.

So, substituting:

1/4 -3 s^2 +3 s^4 -4 s^6 +3 s^3=0

Rearranged:

-4 s^6 +3 s^4 +3 s^3 -3 s^2 +1/4=0

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

-16 s^6 +12 s^4 +12 s^3 -12 s^2 +1=0

So, the equation is:

-16 s^6 +12 s^4 +12 s^3 -12 s^2 +1=0

Hmm, a 6th-degree polynomial. This seems really tough. Maybe we can factor this.

Let me write it as:

16 s^6 -12 s^4 -12 s^3 +12 s^2 -1=0

Wait, multiplying both sides by -1:

16 s^6 -12 s^4 -12 s^3 +12 s^2 -1=0

Hmm, perhaps factor this.

Let me try to factor this polynomial.

Looking for rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are ±1, ±1/2, etc., but let's test s=1:

16(1)^6 -12(1)^4 -12(1)^3 +12(1)^2 -1=16 -12 -12 +12 -1= (16-12)=4, (4-12)=-8, (-8+12)=4, (4-1)=3≠0.

s=1/2:

16*(1/2)^6 -12*(1/2)^4 -12*(1/2)^3 +12*(1/2)^2 -1

=16*(1/64) -12*(1/16) -12*(1/8) +12*(1/4) -1

= (1/4) - (3/4) - (3/2) + 3 -1

= (1/4 -3/4 )= -1/2

-1/2 -3/2 = -2

-2 +3=1

1 -1=0

So, s=1/2 is a root.

Therefore, (s - 1/2 ) is a factor.

Let me perform polynomial division.

Divide 16 s^6 -12 s^4 -12 s^3 +12 s^2 -1 by (s - 1/2 ).

Alternatively, write it as (2s -1 ) to make it easier.

Let me use synthetic division for s=1/2.

But since it's a 6th-degree polynomial, it's a bit tedious, but let's proceed.

Let me write the coefficients in order of descending powers:

16 s^6 +0 s^5 -12 s^4 -12 s^3 +12 s^2 +0 s -1

So, coefficients:16, 0, -12, -12, 12, 0, -1

Divide by (s - 1/2 )

Using synthetic division with root 1/2.

Bring down 16.

Multiply by 1/2: 8.

Add to next coefficient: 0 +8=8.

Multiply by1/2:4.

Add to next: -12 +4= -8.

Multiply by1/2: -4.

Add to next: -12 + (-4)= -16.

Multiply by1/2: -8.

Add to next:12 + (-8)=4.

Multiply by1/2:2.

Add to next:0 +2=2.

Multiply by1/2:1.

Add to last:-1 +1=0.

So, the coefficients after division are:

16, 8, -8, -16, 4, 2, and the remainder is 0.

So, the polynomial factors as (s -1/2 )(16 s^5 +8 s^4 -8 s^3 -16 s^2 +4 s +2 )=0

Now, let's factor the quintic: 16 s^5 +8 s^4 -8 s^3 -16 s^2 +4 s +2.

Let me factor out a 2: 2(8 s^5 +4 s^4 -4 s^3 -8 s^2 +2 s +1 )

Hmm, perhaps factor this quintic.

Try s= -1/2:

8*(-1/2)^5 +4*(-1/2)^4 -4*(-1/2)^3 -8*(-1/2)^2 +2*(-1/2) +1

=8*(-1/32) +4*(1/16) -4*(-1/8) -8*(1/4) + (-1) +1

= (-1/4) + (1/4) + (1/2) -2 -1 +1

= (-1/4 +1/4)=0

0 +1/2=1/2

1/2 -2= -3/2

-3/2 -1= -5/2

-5/2 +1= -3/2 ≠0.

Not zero.

Try s=1:

8 +4 -4 -8 +2 +1= 8+4=12; 12-4=8; 8-8=0; 0+2=2; 2+1=3≠0.

s= -1:

-8 +4 +4 -8 -2 +1= (-8+4)=-4; (-4+4)=0; (0-8)=-8; (-8-2)=-10; (-10+1)=-9≠0.

s=1/2:

8*(1/32) +4*(1/16) -4*(1/8) -8*(1/4) +2*(1/2) +1

= (1/4) + (1/4) - (1/2) -2 +1 +1

= (1/4 +1/4)=1/2; 1/2 -1/2=0; 0 -2= -2; -2 +1= -1; -1 +1=0.

So, s=1/2 is another root.

So, factor out (s -1/2 ) again.

But doing synthetic division again on the quintic.

Wait, but the quintic is 8 s^5 +4 s^4 -4 s^3 -8 s^2 +2 s +1.

Divide by (s -1/2 )

Set up synthetic division:

Coefficients:8,4,-4,-8,2,1

Root:1/2.

Bring down 8.

Multiply by1/2:4.

Add to next:4 +4=8.

Multiply by1/2:4.

Add to next: -4 +4=0.

Multiply by1/2:0.

Add to next: -8 +0= -8.

Multiply by1/2: -4.

Add to next:2 + (-4)= -2.

Multiply by1/2: -1.

Add to last:1 + (-1)=0.

So, the quintic factors as (s -1/2 )(8 s^4 +8 s^3 +0 s^2 -8 s -2 )

So, the polynomial is now:

(s -1/2 )^2 * 2*(8 s^4 +8 s^3 -8 s -2 )=0

So, now, the quartic is 8 s^4 +8 s^3 -8 s -2.

Let me factor out a 2: 2(4 s^4 +4 s^3 -4 s -1 )

Hmm, quartic.

Try rational roots: possible roots are ±1, ±1/2, ±1/4.

Test s=1:

4 +4 -4 -1=3≠0.

s=-1:

4*(-1)^4 +4*(-1)^3 -4*(-1) -1=4 -4 +4 -1=3≠0.

s=1/2:

4*(1/16) +4*(1/8) -4*(1/2) -1= (1/4) + (1/2) -2 -1= (3/4 ) -3= -9/4≠0.

s=-1/2:

4*(1/16) +4*(-1/8) -4*(-1/2) -1= (1/4) - (1/2) +2 -1= (1/4 -1/2 )= -1/4; (-1/4 +2 )=7/4; 7/4 -1=3/4 ≠0.

s=1/4:

4*(1/256) +4*(1/64 ) -4*(1/4 ) -1= approx 0.0156 +0.0625 -1 -1= negative, not zero.

s=-1/4:

4*(1/256 ) +4*(-1/64 ) -4*(-1/4 ) -1= 0.0156 -0.0625 +1 -1= -0.0469≠0.

Hmm, no rational roots. Maybe factor as quadratics.

Assume 4 s^4 +4 s^3 -4 s -1 = (a s^2 +b s +c )(d s^2 +e s +f )

Multiply out:

a d s^4 + (a e +b d ) s^3 + (a f +b e +c d ) s^2 + (b f +c e ) s +c f.

Set equal to 4 s^4 +4 s^3 +0 s^2 -4 s -1.

So, equate coefficients:

a d =4

a e +b d =4

a f +b e +c d=0

b f +c e= -4

c f= -1.

We can try to find integers a,b,c,d,e,f.

Since a d=4, possible pairs (a,d )=(4,1),(2,2),(1,4), (-4,-1), etc.

Let me try a=4, d=1.

Then,

a=4, d=1.

Now, c f= -1. So, possible (c,f )=(1,-1 ) or (-1,1 ).

Try c=1, f=-1.

Then, b f +c e= -4 → b*(-1) +1*e= -4 → -b +e= -4 → e= b -4.

From a e +b d=4:

4 e +b*1=4.

But e = b -4, so,

4*(b -4 ) +b=4 →4b -16 +b=4 →5b=20 →b=4.

So, b=4, e=4 -4=0.

Now, check a f +b e +c d=4*(-1 ) +4*0 +1*1= -4 +0 +1= -3≠0.

Doesn't satisfy. So, this case doesn't work.

Try c=-1, f=1.

Then, b f +c e= -4 →b*1 + (-1)*e= -4 →b -e = -4 → e= b +4.

From a e +b d=4:

4 e +b*1=4.

Substitute e= b +4:

4*(b +4 ) +b=4 →4b +16 +b=4 →5b= -12 →b= -12/5.

Not integer, so discard.

Next, try a=2, d=2.

Then, c f= -1.

Again, c=1, f=-1.

Then, b f +c e= -4 →b*(-1 ) +1*e= -4 →-b +e= -4 →e= b -4.

From a e +b d=4:

2 e +b*2=4.

Substitute e= b -4:

2*(b -4 ) +2b=4 →2b -8 +2b=4 →4b=12 →b=3.

Then, e=3 -4= -1.

Now, check a f +b e +c d=2*(-1 ) +3*(-1 ) +1*2= -2 -3 +2= -3≠0.

Not good.

Try c=-1, f=1.

Then, b*1 + (-1)*e= -4 →b -e= -4 → e= b +4.

From a e +b d=4:

2 e +2b=4.

Substitute e= b +4:

2*(b +4 ) +2b=4 →2b +8 +2b=4 →4b= -4 →b= -1.

Then, e= -1 +4=3.

Check a f +b e +c d=2*1 + (-1)*3 + (-1)*2= 2 -3 -2= -3≠0.

Not good.

Next, try a=1, d=4.

c f= -1.

Try c=1, f=-1.

Then, b f +c e= -4 →b*(-1 ) +1*e= -4 →-b +e= -4 →e= b -4.

From a e +b d=4:

1*e +b*4=4.

Substitute e= b -4:

(b -4 ) +4b=4 →5b -4=4 →5b=8 →b=8/5. Not integer.

Try c=-1, f=1.

Then, b*1 + (-1)*e= -4 →b -e= -4 →e= b +4.

From a e +b d=4:

1*e +b*4=4.

Substitute e= b +4:

(b +4 ) +4b=4 →5b +4=4 →5b=0 →b=0.

Then, e=0 +4=4.

Check a f +b e +c d=1*1 +0*4 +(-1)*4=1 +0 -4= -3≠0.

Nope.

Alternatively, maybe a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe s=1/2 is a double root, so the remaining roots are from 8 s^4 +8 s^3 -8 s -2=0.

But perhaps it's better to abandon this approach, as it's getting too involved.

Alternatively, let's think about the geometry.

We have the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1.

The line AB is y= -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

We can parameterize AB as:

x = t,

y= -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2,

for t from 0 to 1/2.

We need to find t such that (t)^{2/3} + (y)^{2/3}=1.

So,

t^{2/3} + ( -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 )^{2/3 } =1.

Let me set u = t^{1/3 }, so t = u^3.

Then,

(u^3 )^{2/3} + ( -sqrt(3) u^3 + sqrt(3)/2 )^{2/3 } =1

Simplify:

u^2 + ( sqrt(3) ( -u^3 + 1/2 ) )^{2/3 } =1

So,

u^2 + ( sqrt(3) (1/2 - u^3 ) )^{2/3 } =1

Let me denote v = u^3, so 1/2 - u^3 =1/2 - v.

But this substitution might not help much.

Alternatively, let me set s=1/2 - u^3.

But perhaps a better substitution is needed.

Alternatively, let me take both sides to the power of 3/2.

Wait, no, perhaps better to let me define the second term:

Let me denote A = sqrt(3) (1/2 - u^3 )

So, (A )^{2/3 } is the second term.

So,

u^2 + (A )^{2/3 } =1

But A = sqrt(3) (1/2 - u^3 )

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps raise both sides to the 3rd power.

But that would complicate things.

Alternatively, consider that the point C is on AB and the astroid, so we can find t such that the line AB is tangent to the astroid at C.

So, the condition for tangency is that the derivative of the astroid at C is equal to the slope of AB.

The slope of AB is -sqrt(3).

The astroid equation is x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.

Differentiate implicitly:

(2/3) x^{-1/3} + (2/3) y^{-1/3} dy/dx =0

So,

dy/dx = - (x^{-1/3} ) / (y^{-1/3} ) = - (y^{1/3} ) / (x^{1/3} )

So, slope of the astroid at (x, y ) is - (y^{1/3} ) / (x^{1/3} )

At point C, this must equal -sqrt(3).

So,

- (y^{1/3} ) / (x^{1/3} ) = -sqrt(3 )

=> (y^{1/3} ) / (x^{1/3} ) = sqrt(3 )

=> y^{1/3} = sqrt(3 ) x^{1/3 }

=> y = (sqrt(3 ))^3 x = 3 sqrt(3 ) x

But wait, the slope condition gives us that.

But point C is on AB: y= -sqrt(3 ) x + sqrt(3 ) / 2.

So, set:

3 sqrt(3 ) x = -sqrt(3 ) x + sqrt(3 ) /2

Simplify:

3 sqrt(3 ) x + sqrt(3 ) x = sqrt(3 ) /2

=> 4 sqrt(3 ) x = sqrt(3 ) /2

Divide both sides by sqrt(3 ):

4x = 1/2 → x=1/8

So, x=1/8.

Then, y= -sqrt(3 )*(1/8 ) + sqrt(3 )/2= (-sqrt(3 )/8 +4 sqrt(3 )/8 )= 3 sqrt(3 ) /8

So, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3 ) /8 )

Therefore, OC squared is (1/8 )^2 + (3 sqrt(3 ) /8 )^2

Compute:

(1/64 ) + (27 /64 )= (1 +27 ) /64=28/64=7/16

So, OC^2=7/16.

Thus, p=7, q=16, p+q=23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first identify the equation of line segment AB. Points A and B are at \((\frac{1}{2}, 0)\) and \((0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\) respectively. The slope of AB is calculated as \(-\sqrt{3}\), leading to the equation \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Next, we consider the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length, where \(P\) is on the x-axis and \(Q\) is on the y-axis. The equation of each segment is \(x/p + y/q = 1\) with \(p^2 + q^2 = 1\). The envelope of these segments forms an astroid given by \(x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1\).

To find the unique point \(C\) on AB that lies on this astroid, we substitute \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) into the astroid equation. Solving this, we find the point \(C\) at \((\frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8})\).

Finally, we calculate \(OC^2\):
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}.
\]
Thus, \(OC^2 = \frac{7}{16}\), and \(p + q = 7 + 16 = 23\).

\boxed{23}
