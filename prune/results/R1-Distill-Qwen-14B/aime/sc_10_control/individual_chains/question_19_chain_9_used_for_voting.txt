Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC, which is AB·AC.

Alright, so we have triangle ABC with circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6. Also, IA is perpendicular to OI, where O is the circumcenter and I is the incenter.

First, I should recall some properties of triangle centers. The circumradius R is the radius of the circumscribed circle, and the inradius r is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumcenter O is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides, and the incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, that seems like an important condition. Maybe I can use coordinates or some vector approach, but perhaps there's a more straightforward geometric approach.

Let me think about the relationship between the inradius, the circumradius, and other elements of the triangle.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure. Yes, I think that's correct. So OI² = R² - 2Rr.

Given R is 13 and r is 6, so OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13). Hmm, interesting.

But also, we have IA perpendicular to OI. So in the triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So triangle IOA is a right-angled triangle with right angle at I.

Wait, but actually, IA is perpendicular to OI, so the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. So the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular.

Alternatively, in triangle IOA, which is a triangle with sides IO, IA, and OA. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, which is the same as saying that in triangle IOA, the angle at I is 90 degrees.

So, in triangle IOA, right-angled at I, so by Pythagoras theorem: OA² = IO² + IA².

But OA is the circumradius, which is R = 13. So OA = 13.

We already found IO = sqrt(13). So, IO² is 13. Then IA² = OA² - IO² = 13² - (sqrt(13))² = 169 - 13 = 156. So IA = sqrt(156). Simplify that, sqrt(156) is sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). So IA is 2√39.

But IA is the length from the incenter I to vertex A. I wonder if there's a formula that relates IA to other triangle quantities.

Yes, I recall that the length of the inradius can be found using the formula IA = r / sin(A/2), where r is the inradius. Wait, is that right? Let me think.

In a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Hmm, I think that's correct. Because in the inradius formulas, the distance from incenter to vertex can be expressed in terms of angles.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I should think about the formula for the length of the angle bisector, but that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, in triangle AIF, where F is the point where the incircle touches side BC, IA is the hypotenuse and IF is the inradius, which is perpendicular to BC. So in that right triangle, IA² = IF² + AF². But AF is equal to (AB + AC - BC)/2. Since in a triangle, the lengths from the contact points to the vertices are equal to (perimeter)/2 minus the opposite side.

Wait, that might be a bit involved, but maybe I can relate IA to other quantities.

Alternatively, I remember that in triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A is given by IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Yes, that seems familiar.

So if IA = r / sin(A/2), and we know IA is 2√39, and r is 6, then:

2√39 = 6 / sin(A/2)

So sin(A/2) = 6 / (2√39) = 3 / √39 = (3√39) / 39 = √39 / 13.

Wait, let me compute that again.

sin(A/2) = r / IA = 6 / (2√39) = 3 / √39.

Rationalizing the denominator:

3 / √39 = (3√39) / 39 = √39 / 13.

So sin(A/2) = √39 / 13.

Hmm, that's a good relation. Now, knowing that sin(A/2) is √39 / 13, maybe I can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1.

So cos²(A/2) = 1 - sin²(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169.

So cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

Since A is an angle of a triangle, A/2 is less than 90 degrees, so cos(A/2) is positive.

So cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

Now, I might need to relate this to other parts of the triangle.

I remember that the area of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius as Area = r * s, where s is the semiperimeter.

Also, the area can be expressed as (abc)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides, and R is the circumradius.

So maybe if I can relate these expressions, I can find more information.

Let me denote the sides as a, b, c opposite to angles A, B, C respectively.

So side a is BC, b is AC, c is AB.

Wait no, standard notation is a opposite angle A, so a is BC, b is AC, c is AB.

Wait, no, wait: in triangle ABC, side a is opposite angle A, so it's BC; side b is opposite angle B, which is AC; side c is opposite angle C, which is AB.

So AB is side c, AC is side b, BC is side a.

So we're looking to find AB * AC, which is c * b.

So if I can find c and b, or their product, that's the answer.

We know R = 13, r = 6. Also, from above, we have IA = 2√39, and sin(A/2) = √39 / 13, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

Hmm.

Another formula I remember is that in a triangle, cos(A) can be expressed in terms of the sides:

cos A = (b² + c² - a²) / (2bc)

But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

Alternatively, I can think about the formula involving the inradius and semiperimeter.

Let me denote s as the semiperimeter: s = (a + b + c)/2.

Area = r * s = 6s.

Also, Area = (a b c)/(4R) = (a b c)/(4*13) = (a b c)/52.

So setting them equal: 6s = (a b c)/52 => 6 * 52 s = a b c => 312 s = a b c.

Hmm, that's one equation involving a, b, c, s.

But we need more relations.

Another relation comes from the Law of Sines: a = 2 R sin A = 2*13*sin A = 26 sin A.

Similarly, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.

So sides can be expressed in terms of the angles.

But maybe I can find angle A first.

Since I have sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), perhaps I can find sin A and cos A.

Let me compute sin A and cos A.

Using double angle formulas:

sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(√39/13)*(√130/13) = 2*(√(39*130))/169.

Compute 39 * 130: 39*100=3900, 39*30=1170, total 3900+1170=5070. So sqrt(5070). Hmm, 5070 factors: 5070 = 10 * 507 = 10 * 3 * 169 = 10 * 3 * 13².

So sqrt(5070) = sqrt(10*3*13²) = 13 * sqrt(30). Because sqrt(3*10) is sqrt(30).

So sin A = 2*(13*sqrt(30))/169 = (26 sqrt(30))/169 = (2 sqrt(30))/13.

Similarly, cos A = cos²(A/2) - sin²(A/2) = (130/169) - (39/169) = (130 - 39)/169 = 91/169 = 7*13 / 13² = 7/13.

So cos A = 7/13.

So angle A has sin A = 2√30 /13 and cos A = 7/13.

Now, from the Law of Cosines, in triangle ABC:

a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A.

We know cos A = 7/13, so:

a² = b² + c² - 2bc*(7/13).

But I don't know a, b, or c yet.

Wait, but we also have area expressions.

We have area = 6s, and area = (abc)/52.

So 6s = (abc)/52 => abc = 312 s.

Also, from earlier, we can express a, b, c in terms of the angles:

a = 26 sin A = 26*(2√30/13) = 26*(2√30)/13 = 2*2√30 = 4√30.

Wait, let me compute that again.

a = 2 R sin A = 2*13*(2√30 /13) = 26*(2√30)/13. 26 divided by 13 is 2, so a = 2*2√30 = 4√30.

So a = 4√30.

Similarly, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.

Hmm, but I don't know angles B and C yet.

But in any triangle, the sum of angles is π, so A + B + C = π. So if I can find another relation, perhaps involving angle B and C, I can find some equations.

Wait, also, from the inradius formula, area = r*s = 6s.

But area is also (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

So, 6s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

We know sin A is 2√30/13. So:

6s = (1/2)*b*c*(2√30/13) = (b c √30)/13.

So, 6s = (b c √30)/13 => s = (b c √30)/(78).

But s is (a + b + c)/2. We know a = 4√30, so:

(4√30 + b + c)/2 = (b c √30)/78.

Multiply both sides by 2:

4√30 + b + c = (2 b c √30)/78 = (b c √30)/39.

So:

4√30 + b + c = (b c √30)/39.

Hmm, that's equation one.

Also, from the Law of Cosines:

a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A.

We know a = 4√30, so a² = (4√30)^2 = 16*30 = 480.

cos A = 7/13, so:

480 = b² + c² - 2bc*(7/13).

So:

b² + c² - (14 bc)/13 = 480.

Hmm, that's equation two.

So now, we have two equations:

1) 4√30 + b + c = (b c √30)/39.

2) b² + c² - (14 bc)/13 = 480.

This seems complicated, but maybe we can make a substitution.

Let me let x = b + c and y = bc. Then, equation 1 becomes:

4√30 + x = (y √30)/39.

Equation 2 is:

b² + c² - (14 y)/13 = 480.

But b² + c² can be expressed as (b + c)^2 - 2bc = x² - 2y.

So equation 2 becomes:

x² - 2y - (14 y)/13 = 480.

Simplify: x² - (2y + (14 y)/13) = 480.

Compute 2y + (14y)/13: 2y is 26y/13, so adding 14y/13 gives (26y +14y)/13 = 40y/13.

So equation 2 is x² - (40y)/13 = 480.

So equation 2: x² - (40y)/13 = 480.

Equation 1: 4√30 + x = (y√30)/39.

Let's write equation 1 as:

x = (y√30)/39 - 4√30.

Let me factor out √30:

x = √30*(y/39 - 4).

So x = √30*(y - 156)/39.

Wait, because 4 is 156/39, so y/39 - 4 = (y - 156)/39.

So x = √30*(y - 156)/39.

So, x is expressed in terms of y.

Now, substitute x into equation 2.

Equation 2 is x² - (40 y)/13 = 480.

So, x² = [√30*(y - 156)/39]^2 = 30*(y - 156)^2 / (39^2).

Compute 39^2: 39*39=1521.

So x² = 30*(y - 156)^2 / 1521.

So equation 2 becomes:

30*(y - 156)^2 / 1521 - (40 y)/13 = 480.

Let me write this as:

(30 (y - 156)^2 ) / 1521 - (40 y)/13 = 480.

To simplify, let's multiply both sides by 1521 to eliminate denominators.

1521 * [ (30 (y - 156)^2 ) / 1521 - (40 y)/13 ] = 1521 * 480.

Simplify each term:

First term: 30 (y - 156)^2.

Second term: -(40 y)/13 * 1521 = -(40y)* (1521/13) = -(40y)*117 = -4680 y.

Right side: 1521 * 480.

Compute 1521 * 480. Hmm, 1500*480=720,000 and 21*480=10,080. So total is 720,000 +10,080=730,080.

So equation becomes:

30(y - 156)^2 - 4680 y = 730,080.

Divide both sides by 30 to simplify:

(y - 156)^2 - 156 y = 24,336.

Expand (y - 156)^2:

y² - 312 y + 156² = y² - 312 y + 24,336.

So equation becomes:

y² - 312 y +24,336 -156 y =24,336.

Combine like terms:

y² - (312 +156)y +24,336 =24,336.

Simplify:

y² -468 y +24,336 =24,336.

Subtract 24,336 from both sides:

y² -468 y = 0.

Factor:

y(y - 468) = 0.

So solutions are y=0 or y=468.

But y= bc, which is the product of two sides, so it can't be zero. So y=468.

So bc=468.

Wait, that's our target! AB is c, AC is b, so AB·AC = bc =468.

Wait, so the answer is 468.

Wait, let's confirm that this makes sense.

We found that bc=468. Then, from equation 1:

x = √30*(y -156)/39.

Since y=468, x=√30*(468 -156)/39.

Compute 468 -156=312.

So x=√30*(312)/39=√30*(8)=8√30.

So x=8√30.

But x is b + c, so b + c=8√30.

We know bc=468.

So we can find b and c as roots of the quadratic equation t² - (8√30) t + 468=0.

But I don't need to find b and c individually. We just needed bc, which is 468.

So, the answer is 468.

But let me just cross-verify with the earlier equations.

We have bc=468.

From the area expressions: area =6s= (b c √30)/13.

So 6s= (468 *√30)/13.

Compute 468 /13=36.

So 6s=36√30 => s=6√30.

But s=(a +b +c)/2= (4√30 +8√30)/2= (12√30)/2=6√30.

Which matches, so that's consistent.

Another check: from Law of Cosines, a²=480, and equation 2 after substitution gave us bc=468, which all seems consistent.

So I think 468 is the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that the circumradius \( R = 13 \) and the inradius \( r = 6 \). The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) implies that triangle \( IOA \) is right-angled at \( I \). Using the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter, \( OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \), we find \( OI = \sqrt{13} \).

Applying the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( IOA \), we have:
\[
OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \implies 13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \implies IA^2 = 156 \implies IA = 2\sqrt{39}.
\]

Using the formula \( IA = \frac{r}{\sin(A/2)} \), we find:
\[
\sin(A/2) = \frac{6}{2\sqrt{39}} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}.
\]
Then, \( \cos(A/2) = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2(A/2)} = \frac{\sqrt{130}}{13} \).

Next, we express \( \sin A \) and \( \cos A \) using double-angle identities:
\[
\sin A = 2\sin(A/2)\cos(A/2) = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13}, \quad \cos A = 1 - 2\sin^2(A/2) = \frac{7}{13}.
\]

Using the Law of Sines, the side \( a = BC \) is:
\[
a = 2R\sin A = 4\sqrt{30}.
\]

We then use the area formulas \( \text{Area} = r \cdot s \) and \( \text{Area} = \frac{abc}{4R} \) to relate the sides \( b \) and \( c \). Through substitution and solving the resulting quadratic equation, we find that \( bc = 468 \).

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC \) is:
\[
\boxed{468}.
\]
