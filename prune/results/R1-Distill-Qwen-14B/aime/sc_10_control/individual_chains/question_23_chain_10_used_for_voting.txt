Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that's less than BD² for all rhombi ABCD on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. The rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. Hmm, rhombus with vertices on hyperbola and diagonals intersecting at the origin. Interesting.

First, I remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, not necessarily right angles, but they do bisect each other. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, for a rhombus ABCD, if I consider points A, B, C, D, then the midpoint of AC is the origin, and the midpoint of BD is also the origin.

So, if I let point A be (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (u, v), then point D must be (-u, -v). So all four points are (x, y), (-x, -y), (u, v), (-u, -v). And these points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

So, points A, B, C, D must satisfy the hyperbola equation:

For point A: (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1.

Similarly for point B: (u²)/20 - (v²)/24 = 1.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, and so on.

Wait, but another property of a rhombus is that the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes is -1.

What's the slope of AC? Let's see. Points A (x, y) and C (-x, -y). So, the slope of AC is ( -y - y ) / ( -x - x ) = (-2y)/(-2x) = y/x.

Similarly, the slope of BD: points B (u, v) and D (-u, -v). Slope is (-v - v)/(-u - u) = (-2v)/(-2u) = v/u.

Since AC and BD are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1:

(y/x) * (v/u) = -1.

So, (yv)/(xu) = -1 => yv = -xu.

So, this gives us a relationship between the coordinates of A and B: yv = -xu.

Hmm, okay. So that's one equation.

Now, I need to find BD². Let's think about BD. Points B and D are (u, v) and (-u, -v), so the distance between them is sqrt[(u - (-u))² + (v - (-v))²] = sqrt[(2u)^2 + (2v)^2] = 2*sqrt(u² + v²). Therefore, BD² is (2*sqrt(u² + v²))² = 4*(u² + v²). So, BD² = 4(u² + v²).

So, I need to find the infimum (the greatest lower bound) of BD², which is 4(u² + v²). So, to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi, I need to find the minimum possible value of BD², or perhaps the infimum.

Wait, but the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, it's like the infimum of BD², because I need the largest number that doesn't exceed BD² for any rhombus. So, if I find the minimum value of BD², that would be the infimum, and that number would be the greatest lower bound.

So, the problem reduces to finding the minimum possible value of BD², which is 4(u² + v²), given the constraints that points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, and yv = -xu. Also, points A and B are (x, y) and (u, v), which are on the hyperbola.

So, given that, I need to express BD² in terms of one variable and then find its minimum.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use parametric coordinates for the hyperbola to express points A and B.

I remember that hyperbolas can be parameterized using hyperbolic functions.

For the hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, a parametric representation is (a secθ, b tanθ). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as (a cosh t, b sinh t) for hyperbola.

Wait, but hyperbola can be parametrized in terms of sec and tan, but that's for rectangular hyperbola? Wait, no, actually, the standard hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² =1 can be parametrized as x = a secθ, y = b tanθ, because when you plug in, (a² sec²θ)/a² - (b² tan²θ)/b² = sec²θ - tan²θ =1, which works.

So, let me use this parametrization for points A and B.

Let me denote point A as (a secθ, b tanθ), where a²=20 and b²=24. So, a=2√5, b=2√6.

Similarly, point B can be (a secφ, b tanφ).

But wait, do I need to parametrize both points? Or maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express point B in terms of point A, using the condition that diagonals are perpendicular.

We have that yv = -xu.

So, using point A as (x, y) and point B as (u, v), we have yv = -xu.

So, v = -(xu)/y.

So, if I express v in terms of u, x, y, I can write v = -(xu)/y.

So, point B is (u, -(xu)/y).

Now, since point B lies on the hyperbola, it must satisfy the equation:

u²/20 - v²/24 = 1.

Substituting v, we get:

u²/20 - [ (x² u²)/(y²) ] /24 =1.

Simplify: u² [1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²) ] =1.

So, u² [ (24 y² - 20 x² ) / (24 * 20 y²) ) ] =1.

Wait, let me compute that:

1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²) = (24 y² - 20 x²) / (24 * 20 y²).

Compute numerator: 24 y² - 20 x².

But from the hyperbola equation for point A: x²/20 - y²/24 =1 => x² =20(1 + y²/24) =20 + (20 y²)/24 =20 + (5 y²)/6.

So, x² =20 + (5 y²)/6.

So, substitute x² into the numerator:

24 y² -20*(20 + (5 y²)/6 ) =24 y² -400 - (100 y²)/6.

Simplify:

24 y² = 144 y²/6.

So, 144 y²/6 -100 y²/6 =44 y²/6 =22 y²/3.

So, numerator becomes 22 y²/3 -400.

So, overall:

u² [ (22 y²/3 -400 ) / (24*20 y²) ) ] =1.

Simplify the denominator: 24*20=480.

So, denominator is 480 y².

So, u² = [ (480 y² ) / (22 y²/3 -400) ) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Let me write it as:

u² = 480 y² / ( (22 y² -1200)/3 ) ) = 480 y² * 3 / (22 y² -1200 ) = 1440 y² / (22 y² -1200 ).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

1440 y² / (22 y² -1200 ) = [1440 y² ] / [ 22 y² -1200 ].

Factor numerator and denominator:

Factor numerator: 1440 = 22 * 65.45... Hmm, perhaps not useful.

Alternatively, factor denominator: 22 y² -1200 = 22(y² - 54.545...). Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can factor 22 from denominator:

22(y² - (1200/22)) = 22(y² - 54.545...).

Not too helpful. Alternatively, let's write u² as:

u² = (1440 y² ) / (22 y² -1200 ) = [1440 y² ] / [22 y² -1200 ].

I can factor numerator and denominator by 2:

Numerator: 1440 y² = 2 *720 y².

Denominator: 22 y² -1200 = 2(11 y² -600).

So, u² = (2 *720 y² ) / (2(11 y² -600 )) = 720 y² / (11 y² -600 ).

So, u² = 720 y² / (11 y² -600 ).

Hmm, okay. So, u² is expressed in terms of y².

So, since u² must be positive, the denominator must have the same sign as the numerator.

So, 720 y² and (11 y² -600 ) must be both positive or both negative.

But 720 y² is always non-negative, and since y² is positive unless y=0, but y=0 would make point A at (±a, 0), but then v would be zero, but then point B would be (u, 0), which would be another point on the hyperbola. But in that case, the rhombus would have points A, B, C, D, but if y=0, then v=0, so points would be (x, 0), (-x, 0), (u,0), (-u, 0). But that would make all points on the x-axis, which can't form a rhombus because they would be colinear. So, y cannot be zero.

So, y² >0, so 720 y² >0.

Therefore, denominator must also be positive: 11 y² -600>0 => y²>600/11 ≈54.545.

So, y²>600/11.

Thus, for u² to be positive, y² must be greater than 600/11.

So, that gives me a condition on y.

Now, I need to find BD² =4(u² + v²).

But I can express v in terms of u, x, y, as v = -xu/y.

So, v² = (x² u²)/y².

So, BD² =4(u² + (x² u²)/y² ) =4 u² (1 + x² / y² ).

From earlier, x² =20 + (5 y² )/6.

So, x² =20 + (5 y² )/6.

So, x² / y² = 20 / y² + 5/6.

Therefore, 1 + x² / y² =1 +20/y² +5/6= (6 + 20/y² +5)/6= (11 +20/y²)/6.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

1 + x²/y² =1 + [20 + (5 y² )/6 ] / y² = 1 +20/y² +5/6.

So, 1 +5/6= 11/6.

So, 1 +x²/y²= 11/6 +20/y².

So, BD²=4 u² (11/6 +20/y² ).

But from earlier, u²=720 y²/(11 y² -600 ).

So, substituting u²:

BD²=4*(720 y²/(11 y² -600 )) * (11/6 +20/y² ).

Let me compute this expression step by step.

First, compute 4*720 y²/(11 y² -600 ) = 2880 y²/(11 y² -600 ).

Then, multiply by (11/6 +20/y² ).

So, BD²= [2880 y²/(11 y² -600 ) ] * [11/6 +20/y² ].

Let me express 11/6 +20/y² as (11 y² +120 )/(6 y² ).

Because:

11/6 +20/y² = (11 y² +120 )/(6 y² ).

So, substituting, BD²= [2880 y²/(11 y² -600 ) ] * [ (11 y² +120 )/(6 y² ) ].

Simplify:

2880 y² * (11 y² +120 ) / [ (11 y² -600 ) *6 y² ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

2880 /6=480.

y² cancels with y² in denominator.

So, BD²=480*(11 y² +120 )/(11 y² -600 ).

So, BD²=480*(11 y² +120 )/(11 y² -600 ).

Hmm, now this is a function of y². Let me denote z= y².

Given that z>600/11≈54.545.

So, BD²=480*(11 z +120 )/(11 z -600 ).

Let me write this as:

BD²=480*(11 z +120 )/(11 z -600 ).

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

11 z +120=11(z) +120.

11 z -600=11(z) -600.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor 11 z +120 and 11 z -600.

Wait, let me see:

11 z +120=11(z + 120/11).

Similarly, 11 z -600=11(z -600/11).

So, BD²=480*(11(z +120/11 ))/(11(z -600/11 ))=480*(z +120/11)/(z -600/11 ).

Because 11 cancels out.

So, BD²=480*(z +120/11)/(z -600/11 ).

Simplify:

Let me write 120/11=10.909 and 600/11=54.545 approximately.

But let me keep it as fractions:

120/11=120/11.

600/11=600/11.

So, BD²=480*(z + 120/11)/(z -600/11 ).

Let me denote t = z -600/11.

Since z>600/11, t>0.

So, z= t +600/11.

Substituting into BD²:

BD²=480*( (t +600/11 +120/11 ) ) / t =480*( t + (600 +120)/11 ) /t=480*(t +720/11)/t.

So, BD²=480*(1 + (720/11)/t )=480*(1 +720/(11 t )).

Since t>0, as z>600/11.

So, BD²=480*(1 +720/(11 t )).

Now, since t>0, 720/(11 t ) can be any positive number. So, as t approaches 0 from the right, BD² approaches infinity. As t approaches infinity, BD² approaches 480.

But wait, that suggests that BD² can be made arbitrarily large, but we are looking for the minimum BD². Because the problem is asking for the greatest number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi, which implies that BD² can get arbitrarily close to some lower bound, but never less than that.

Wait, but from the expression above, when t approaches infinity, BD² approaches 480. So, BD² can be made as close to 480 as desired by choosing t large enough, i.e., by choosing z large enough.

But is 480 attainable? When z approaches infinity, BD² approaches 480. So, the infimum of BD² is 480.

But wait, let me double-check.

So, BD²=480*(1 +720/(11 t )).

So, as t→infty, 720/(11 t )→0, so BD² approaches 480.

Therefore, the infimum of BD² is 480. So, BD² can be as close to 480 as we like, but can it be less than 480? Because if BD² approaches 480 from above, then 480 is the lower bound, and so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480.

Wait, but let's check: for finite t, BD² is greater than 480. So, BD²>480 for all possible rhombi. Therefore, the infimum would be 480, and the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.

But wait, let's check:

If t approaches infinity, meaning that z approaches infinity, which implies y² approaches infinity. So, point A is going off to infinity on the hyperbola.

But wait, hyperbola extends to infinity, so that's possible.

But let me verify with a concrete example. Let me choose a point A with large y², say y²=1000, which is much larger than 600/11≈54.545.

So, z= y²=1000.

Then, BD²=480*(11*1000 +120)/(11*1000 -600 )=480*(11000 +120)/(11000 -600 )=480*(11120)/(10400 ).

Compute 11120/10400=1.06923.

So, BD²=480*1.06923≈480*1.06923≈512.43.

Which is greater than 480. So, as y² increases, BD² approaches 480.

Similarly, if I take y²=10000, then BD²≈480*(11*10000 +120)/(11*10000 -600 )=480*(110000 +120)/(110000 -600 )=480*(110120)/(109400 )=480*(approx 1.006696 )≈480*1.0067≈484. So, getting closer to 480.

So, as y² increases, BD² approaches 480 from above.

Therefore, BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but never less than 480.

Hence, the infimum of BD² is 480, so the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again.

Wait, in the expression BD²=480*(1 +720/(11 t )).

Since t>0, 720/(11 t ) is positive, so BD² is always greater than 480*(1 +0 )=480. So, BD² is always greater than 480.

Therefore, 480 is the infimum, and the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

So, the answer should be 480.

Wait, but wait a second. I need to make sure that BD² can't be less than 480. Suppose I choose a point where y² is just above 600/11, like y²=600/11 + ε, for very small ε>0.

Then, t=z -600/11= (600/11 + ε ) -600/11= ε.

So, t= ε.

So, BD²=480*(1 +720/(11 ε )).

As ε approaches zero, BD² approaches infinity.

So, when y² is just above 600/11, BD² is very large. As y² increases, BD² decreases towards 480.

So, BD² can take any value from (480, ∞).

Therefore, the infimum is 480, and hence, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

So, the answer should be 480.

Wait, but let me see if I can find a rhombus where BD² is exactly 480. Probably not, because that would require t approaching infinity, which is not possible. So, BD² can approach 480 but never actually reach it.

So, 480 is the lower bound, so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

Therefore, I think the answer is 480.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the rhombus \(ABCD\) has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. This implies that the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\). Therefore, if \(A = (x, y)\), then \(C = (-x, -y)\), and if \(B = (u, v)\), then \(D = (-u, -v)\). All four points lie on the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\).

Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are perpendicular. The slopes of \(AC\) and \(BD\) are \(\frac{y}{x}\) and \(\frac{v}{u}\), respectively. Their product must be \(-1\), leading to the condition \(yv = -xu\).

The length of diagonal \(BD\) is given by:
\[
BD^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2)
\]
We aim to find the infimum of \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi. Using parametric coordinates for the hyperbola, we express points \(A\) and \(B\) as \((a \sec\theta, b \tan\theta)\) and \((a \sec\phi, b \tan\phi)\), respectively, where \(a^2 = 20\) and \(b^2 = 24\).

Substituting these into the condition \(yv = -xu\), we derive relationships between the coordinates and express \(BD^2\) in terms of a single variable. After simplifying, we find:
\[
BD^2 = 480 \left(1 + \frac{720}{11t}\right)
\]
where \(t\) is a positive parameter. As \(t\) approaches infinity, \(BD^2\) approaches \(480\), indicating that \(480\) is the infimum.

Thus, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is \(\boxed{480}\).
