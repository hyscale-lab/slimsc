Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.

A number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are satisfied:
1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. So, n is a two-digit number in base b.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

The example given is 81 being 13-eautiful. Let me check that. In base 13, 81 is written as 63 because 6*13 + 3 = 81. Then, 6 + 3 = 9, and sqrt(81) is indeed 9. So that makes sense.

Alright, so first, I need to express n in base b as a two-digit number. In base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1*d2_b, which translates to d1*b + d2 in decimal. So, n = d1*b + d2, where d1 and d2 are digits in base b. That means d1 can be from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero) and d2 can be from 0 to b-1.

The second condition is that d1 + d2 = sqrt(n). Since sqrt(n) must be an integer because the sum of two integers is an integer. So, n must be a perfect square. That's an important point. So n is a perfect square, let's say n = k^2 where k is a positive integer.

So, putting it together:
n = d1*b + d2 = k^2
and
d1 + d2 = k

So, we have two equations:
1. d1*b + d2 = k^2
2. d1 + d2 = k

Let me try to solve these equations. Let's subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate d2.

(d1*b + d2) - (d1 + d2) = k^2 - k
d1*(b - 1) = k^2 - k
So, d1 = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1)

Since d1 must be an integer, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, d1 has to be between 1 and b-1 because it's a digit in base b.

Similarly, from equation 2, d2 = k - d1. Since d2 must be between 0 and b-1, k - d1 must be >=0 and <= b-1.

So, let me write these constraints:
1. 1 <= d1 <= b - 1
2. 0 <= d2 = k - d1 <= b - 1

Which implies:
k - d1 >= 0 => d1 <= k
and
k - d1 <= b - 1 => d1 >= k - (b - 1)

But d1 must also be at least 1, so combining these:
max(1, k - (b - 1)) <= d1 <= min(b - 1, k)

But since d1 is expressed in terms of k and b via d1 = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1), we can substitute that into these inequalities.

So, let me write that:

max(1, k - (b - 1)) <= (k^2 - k)/(b - 1) <= min(b - 1, k)

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe another approach would help.

Let me think about the possible values of k. Since n is a two-digit number in base b, n must satisfy b <= n < b^2. Because the smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b which is b in decimal, and the largest is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b^2 - 1.

So, n is in [b, b^2 - 1], and since n is a perfect square, k = sqrt(n) is in [sqrt(b), sqrt(b^2 - 1)]. So, k ranges from roughly sqrt(b) to approximately b - 1 (since sqrt(b^2 -1 ) is just a bit less than b).

So, possible k values are integers from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b^2 - 1)), which is floor(b - 1 / b) ??? Wait, sqrt(b^2 -1) is just less than b. So, floor(sqrt(b^2 -1)) is b - 1, because (b - 1)^2 = b^2 - 2b + 1, which is less than b^2 -1 for b >2.

Wait, let me check for b=2: sqrt(3)=1.732, so floor is 1. For b=3, sqrt(8)=2.828, floor is 2. For b=4, sqrt(15)=3.872, floor is 3. So yes, in general, floor(sqrt(b^2 -1)) is b -1.

So, k can be from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b -1.

But k must also satisfy that d1 = (k^2 -k)/(b -1) is an integer between 1 and b -1, and d2 = k - d1 is between 0 and b -1.

So, for each base b, we can find all k in [ceiling(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b -1), and d1 and d2 as calculated satisfy their constraints.

So, the problem reduces to: for a given b, how many k's satisfy these conditions. We need to find the smallest b such that the number of such k's is more than 10.

So, to rephrase, for each b >=2, compute the number of integers k in [ceiling(sqrt(b)), b -1] where (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b -1), and when you compute d1 = (k^2 -k)/(b -1), d1 is in [1, b-1], and d2 = k - d1 is in [0, b-1].

So, the plan is:
1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards, compute the number of valid k's.
2. The first b where the count exceeds 10 is our answer.

This seems computationally intensive, but perhaps we can find a pattern or formula.

Let me try to analyze the equation d1 = (k^2 -k)/(b -1). Since d1 must be an integer, (b -1) must divide (k^2 -k). So, (b -1) | (k^2 -k) => (b -1) divides k(k -1).

But k and k-1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. So, (b -1) must divide the product k(k -1), but since k and k-1 are coprime, (b -1) must be a product of factors, each of which divides either k or k-1.

So, (b -1) can be factored into two parts, say, m and n, such that m divides k and n divides (k -1). Since m and n are coprime, because k and k -1 are coprime.

Therefore, (b -1) = m * n, where m divides k and n divides (k -1), and gcd(m, n) = 1.

This suggests that for each b, (b -1) can be factored into m and n, and for each such factorization, we can solve for k ≡0 mod m and k ≡1 mod n. Then, the solutions k would satisfy the conditions.

Wait, that sounds like the Chinese Remainder Theorem. So, for each pair of coprime factors m and n of (b -1), where m*n = (b -1), we can solve the system:
k ≡0 mod m
k ≡1 mod n

Which will give a unique solution modulo m*n, which is b -1.

So, for each such factorization, we get a solution k. Then, we can check if k is within the required range [ceiling(sqrt(b)), b -1].

But this seems a bit involved. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, since (b -1) divides k(k -1), and k and k-1 are coprime, then (b -1) must be a product of two coprime factors, one dividing k and the other dividing k-1. So, for each divisor d of (b -1), we can set d to divide k and (b -1)/d to divide (k -1). Then, for each such d, we can find k such that k ≡0 mod d and k ≡1 mod ( (b -1)/d ).

So, for each d dividing (b -1), we can find k = 1 + t*( (b -1)/d ), where t is such that k ≡0 mod d.

So, let's set this up. Let me write:

k ≡0 mod d
k ≡1 mod m, where m = (b -1)/d

Since (b -1) = d*m, and d and m are coprime? Wait, not necessarily. Only if (b -1) is square-free? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, but for the two congruences to have a solution, d and m must be coprime. Because if they are not, the congruences might be incompatible.

Wait, for the system:
k ≡0 mod d
k ≡1 mod m

To have a solution, it's necessary that 0 ≡1 mod gcd(d, m). So, gcd(d, m) must divide 1, which implies that d and m must be coprime. So, in our case, since (b -1) = d*m, and d and m must be coprime. So, for each divisor d of (b -1), such that d and (b -1)/d are coprime, we can find a unique solution modulo d*m.

Therefore, for each divisor d of (b -1) where d and (b -1)/d are coprime, we can find a k that satisfies the two congruences. Then, each such k will give a solution.

Thus, the number of k's for a given b is equal to the number of such divisors d of (b -1) where d and (b -1)/d are coprime.

Wait, let me think again. Because for each such d, we get exactly one solution for k modulo (b -1). So, since k is up to b -1, there will be exactly one solution in each modulus. So, for each such d, we get exactly one k in the range [1, (b -1)].

But k must also be at least ceiling(sqrt(b)) and at most b -1.

So, for each such d, we can find a k, but we need to check if that k is within our desired range.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated, but perhaps it's manageable.

Let me consider that for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of divisors d of (b -1) such that d and (b -1)/d are coprime, and the corresponding k is in the range [ceiling(sqrt(b)), b -1].

Wait, but perhaps for each such d, there's exactly one k in [1, (b -1)] that satisfies the congruences. So, if k is in the required range, it counts as a valid solution.

Therefore, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of such divisors d for which the corresponding solution k is >= ceiling(sqrt(b)).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of (b -1) such that d and (b -1)/d are coprime, and the resulting k is in the required range.

But maybe this approach isn't simplifying things. Let me try another way.

Let me express k in terms of d1. From the equation, d1 = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1). So, since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b -1, (k^2 -k) must be a multiple of (b -1), and the result must be between 1 and b -1.

So, (k^2 -k) = (b -1)*d1. Since d1 >=1, we have k^2 -k >= b -1. So, k^2 -k - (b -1) >= 0. Let me solve for k.

k^2 -k - (b -1) >=0.

This is a quadratic in k: k^2 -k - (b -1) >=0.

The roots are [1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*(b -1))]/2.

Which simplifies to [1 ± sqrt(4b -3)]/2.

Since k is positive, we only consider the positive root: [1 + sqrt(4b -3)]/2.

So, k >= [1 + sqrt(4b -3)]/2.

Which means that k must be at least the ceiling of [1 + sqrt(4b -3)]/2.

But earlier, I thought that k starts at ceiling(sqrt(b)). So, which one is it?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think.

From the equation n = k^2, and n is a two-digit number in base b, so n >= b.

Thus, k^2 >= b => k >= sqrt(b).

So, the lower bound on k is ceiling(sqrt(b)).

But from the equation (k^2 -k) >= (b -1)*1, which is (k^2 -k) >= (b -1). So, k^2 -k - (b -1) >=0.

So, which is a stricter condition? Let's see.

Suppose b is 2. Then, sqrt(b) is ~1.414, so ceiling is 2. But (k^2 -k) >=1. Let's solve k^2 -k -1 >=0. The roots are [1 ± sqrt(5)]/2. So, positive root is (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ~1.618. So, k >=2. So, both conditions give k >=2. So, in this case, same.

But what about b=5?

sqrt(b)=~2.236, ceiling is 3.

From (k^2 -k) >=4. So, k^2 -k -4 >=0. Roots are [1 ± sqrt(17)]/2, positive root ~2.56. So, k >=3. So, same as ceiling(sqrt(b)).

Wait, perhaps in general, the condition k >= ceiling(sqrt(b)) is sufficient because (k^2 -k) >= (b -1) is automatically satisfied when k >= ceiling(sqrt(b)).

Let me check for a higher b. Let's say b=10. sqrt(b)=3.162, ceiling is 4.

From (k^2 -k) >=9.

So, k^2 -k -9 >=0. Roots: [1 ± sqrt(37)]/2, positive root ~3.54. So, k >=4.

Which is the same as ceiling(sqrt(10))=4.

Another example: b=20. sqrt(b)=4.472, ceiling is 5.

From k^2 -k >=19. So, k^2 -k -19 >=0. Roots: [1 ± sqrt(77)]/2 ~ (1 +8.774)/2 ~4.887. So, k >=5.

So, again, same as ceiling(sqrt(b)).

Thus, it seems that the two conditions are the same for the lower bound on k. So, k starts at ceiling(sqrt(b)).

So, perhaps the earlier analysis holds.

So, for each b, the number of k's in [ceiling(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b -1), which gives d1 as integer, and d2 = k - d1 as a digit in base b.

So, let me try to compute the number of solutions for a given b.

But this seems tedious. Maybe I can find a pattern or relate it to the number of divisors of (b -1).

Wait, earlier I thought that for each d dividing (b -1) with d and (b -1)/d coprime, there is a solution k. So, the number of such d's would be equal to the number of ways to factor (b -1) into two coprime factors d and m, where d*m=(b -1).

And for each such factorization, we get a unique solution k modulo (b -1).

But since k must be in [ceiling(sqrt(b)), b -1], each such k would be unique in that range.

Therefore, the number of solutions is equal to the number of such factorizations.

But wait, the number of such factorizations is equal to 2^{number of prime factors of (b -1)}. Because for each prime factor, we can assign it to either d or m, but not both.

Wait, yes, if (b -1) is square-free, then the number of ways to split into coprime factors d and m is 2^{omega(n)}, where omega(n) is the number of distinct prime factors of n. But if (b -1) has a square factor, then it's more complicated because we can't split exponents.

Wait, no, actually, even if (b -1) is not square-free, the number of coprime factorizations into d and m is 2^{omega(n)} because each prime power must go entirely to one factor or the other.

Wait, for example, if (b -1) = p^k, then the number of coprime factorizations is 2: d=1, m=p^k or d=p^k, m=1.

But in that case, the number of coprime factorizations is 2, regardless of the exponent.

Wait, more generally, for (b -1) being a product of prime powers, the number of coprime factorizations into d and m is 2^{number of distinct prime factors}.

Because for each prime factor, you choose whether it goes to d or to m.

So, for example, if (b -1)= p*q*r, then the number of coprime factorizations is 2^3=8.

So, in general, if (b -1) has t distinct prime factors, the number of coprime factorizations is 2^t.

But wait, in our problem, for each coprime factorization (d, m), we have a unique solution for k modulo (b -1). So, each coprime factorization gives a unique k in [1, b -1]. So, the number of solutions k is 2^t, where t is the number of distinct prime factors of (b -1).

But wait, is that correct?

Wait, let's take an example.

Take b=13, so (b -1)=12. 12 factors into 2^2 * 3^1, so the number of distinct prime factors is 2 (primes 2 and 3). So, the number of coprime factorizations is 2^2=4.

So, for each of these 4 factorizations, we should get a solution k.

Let's compute them.

The factorizations where d and m are coprime:

1. d=1, m=12
2. d=3, m=4
3. d=4, m=3
4. d=12, m=1

So, 4 factorizations. Then, for each, solve:

Case 1: d=1, m=12
k ≡0 mod 1 (which is always true)
k ≡1 mod 12
So, k ≡1 mod 12. In the range [ceiling(sqrt(13))=4, 12], the possible k's are 13, but 13 is beyond 12, so no solution here.

Case 2: d=3, m=4
k ≡0 mod 3
k ≡1 mod 4

Find k such that k ≡0 mod3 and k≡1 mod4.

Solutions: k= 9, since 9 mod3=0, 9 mod4=1. So, k=9 is a solution. So, n=k^2=81.

Which is the example given.

Case3: d=4, m=3
k ≡0 mod4
k ≡1 mod3

Find k such that k ≡0 mod4 and k≡1 mod3.

Let's solve this system.

k ≡0 mod4
k ≡1 mod3

Let me write k=4t. Then, 4t ≡1 mod3 => t ≡1 mod3 (because 4≡1 mod3). So, t=3s +1.

So, k=4*(3s +1)=12s +4.

In the range [4,12], the possible s values are s=0: k=4, s=1: k=16 (too big). So, k=4.

Check: d1=(4^2 -4)/(13-1)= (16-4)/12=12/12=1. d2=4 -1=3. So, n=1*13 +3=16. Wait, but 4^2=16, which is correct. So, n=16 is 13-eautiful.

So, k=4 and k=9 are solutions in this case.

Case4: d=12, m=1
k ≡0 mod12
k ≡1 mod1 (always true)

So, k=12 mod12=0. But k must be >=4, and <=12. So, k=12.

Check: d1=(144 -12)/12=132/12=11. d2=12 -11=1. n=11*13 +1=143 +1=144=12^2. So, that's correct.

So, k=12 is another solution.

Wait, but earlier in case1, when d=1, m=12, we had k=1 mod12. So, in range 4 to 12, k=13 is beyond, but k=1 is less than 4, so not considered.

So, in this case, we have k=4,9,12 as solutions. So, that's 3 solutions for b=13.

But according to the earlier factorization, we expected 4 solutions. Hmm, why is that?

Wait, because in case1, the solution k=1 is below our lower bound of 4, so we don't count it. Similarly, in case4, the solution k=0 is not acceptable because k must be at least 4.

Wait, let's see. So, perhaps for each factorization, we can have a solution, but some of them may lie outside our desired range.

So, the number of valid solutions is equal to the number of factorizations where the corresponding k is within [ceiling(sqrt(b)), b -1].

So, in this case, for b=13, (b-1)=12, which has 4 factorizations, but only 3 of them yield k in the range [4,12]. So, number of b-eautiful numbers is 3.

But according to the problem statement, 81 is 13-eautiful, which is n=81, k=9. So, that's one. But earlier, we found k=4 and k=12 as well.

Wait, let's compute n for k=4: n=4^2=16. In base 13, 16 is 13 +3 = 1*13 +3, so 13 is 1*13 +3? Wait, 16 is 1*13 +3, which is '13' in base 13? Wait, no, digits in base 13 can only go up to 12. So, the digits are d1=1, d2=3, which is correct.

So, n=16 is 13-eautiful. Similarly, n=144 is 13-eautiful.

So, for b=13, there are three b-eautiful numbers: 16, 81, and 144.

So, that's three solutions. So, the number of solutions is equal to the number of factorizations where the corresponding k is in the required range.

So, in this case, 3 solutions.

Thus, the number of solutions depends on the number of factorizations of (b -1) into coprime pairs (d,m), and whether the resulting k falls within the required range.

Therefore, to find the number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b, we need to:

1. Factor (b -1) into coprime pairs (d, m), where d*m = (b -1).
2. For each such pair, solve the system k ≡0 mod d and k ≡1 mod m.
3. Check if the solution k is in [ceiling(sqrt(b)), b -1].
4. Count the number of such valid k's.

So, the number of solutions is equal to the number of such valid k's.

Given that, the problem is to find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.

So, the approach is:

- For each base b starting from 2 upwards:
   - Compute t, the number of distinct prime factors of (b -1).
   - The number of coprime factorizations is 2^t.
   - For each coprime factorization (d, m), compute k.
   - Check if k is in [ceiling(sqrt(b)), b -1].
   - Count the number of valid k's.
   - If the count exceeds 10, return b.

So, let's try to find a pattern or perhaps a formula that can help us find such a b without checking each one manually.

But considering the complexity, perhaps the fastest way is to compute for each b, the number of valid k's, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.

But since I can't compute this for every b manually, I need to find a pattern or a mathematical way to estimate when the number of solutions would cross 10.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is directly related to the number of coprime factorizations, which is 2^t, where t is the number of distinct prime factors of (b -1). So, if 2^t >10, then t >=4, since 2^4=16>10.

Wait, but even if t=4, the number of coprime factorizations is 16, but some of them will result in k outside the desired range. So, the actual number of valid solutions might be less.

But perhaps, if (b -1) has enough small prime factors, the number of solutions will be higher.

Wait, let's see: to get a high number of solutions, (b -1) should have many small prime factors, leading to many coprime factorizations, and each of those may result in a k in the desired range.

So, perhaps the minimal b is when (b -1) is a primorial number, which is the product of the first few primes. For example, 2, 6, 30, 210, etc. These have the maximum number of distinct prime factors for their size.

So, let's consider b -1=210, which is 2*3*5*7. So, t=4, number of coprime factorizations is 16. So, potentially, 16 solutions. But some of them would have k below the required ceiling(sqrt(b)).

So, for b=211, let's compute the range of k: ceiling(sqrt(211))=15.

So, k must be in [15, 210]. So, we need to see how many of the 16 solutions have k >=15.

But without computing each one, it's hard to say, but likely, many of them would be above 15, so the number of solutions could be 10 or more.

But perhaps a smaller b would already suffice.

Wait, let's think of another angle. The number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of (b -1) such that d and (b -1)/d are coprime, and the corresponding k is in the desired range.

But since the number of such d's is 2^t, where t is the number of distinct prime factors of (b -1), we can estimate that when (b -1) has t=4, then 2^4=16 solutions. So, it's possible that for b=211, we have 16 solutions, but many of them would be too low (k <15). So, perhaps, the number of valid solutions is 16 minus the number of solutions with k <15.

Alternatively, the minimal b is when (b -1) is as smooth as possible, i.e., has many small prime factors, allowing for many coprime factorizations, each of which gives a k in the required range.

Alternatively, perhaps b=230 is the answer, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should test for smaller b's.

Let me start checking from b=2 upwards, but that would take too much time. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern.

Wait, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of (b -1) such that d and (b -1)/d are coprime, and the resulting k is in [ceiling(sqrt(b)), b -1].

So, the number of solutions is equal to the number of such d's where the corresponding k is in the desired range.

But perhaps, for a given b, if (b -1) has many small factors, then the number of k's could be high.

Alternatively, perhaps when (b -1) is a factorial, but factorial numbers have many factors, but not necessarily coprime.

Wait, perhaps the minimal b is 230, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can find a formula that relates the number of solutions to the number of prime factors.

But I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about when the number of solutions becomes 11.

Let me think: for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of coprime factorizations of (b-1) that result in k >= ceiling(sqrt(b)).

So, the more coprime factorizations, the more solutions. So, to get more than 10 solutions, we need a b where (b -1) has at least 11 coprime factorizations that result in k in the desired range.

But each coprime factorization can at most contribute one solution. So, (b -1) must have at least 11 coprime factorizations, but since the number of coprime factorizations is 2^t, where t is the number of distinct prime factors, we need 2^t >=11. So, t >=4, since 2^4=16.

So, the minimal (b -1) should have at least 4 distinct prime factors.

So, the minimal (b -1) would be the product of the first four primes: 2*3*5*7=210.

So, b=211.

But then, for b=211, (b -1)=210, which has 4 distinct prime factors, so the number of coprime factorizations is 16. So, 16 possible k's.

But we need to check how many of these k's are >= ceiling(sqrt(211))=15.

But since 210 is a large number, and k can go up to 210, many of these k's would be above 15. So, perhaps all 16 solutions are valid, meaning 16 b-eautiful numbers. Which is way more than 10.

But perhaps a smaller b with (b -1) having 4 prime factors would have enough solutions.

Wait, but 210 is the minimal (b -1) with 4 distinct prime factors. So, the minimal b is 211.

But maybe b=121 is smaller. Let's check b=121.

Wait, (b -1)=120=2^3*3*5. So, the number of distinct prime factors is 3. So, the number of coprime factorizations is 2^3=8.

So, 8 solutions. But 8 <10, so not enough.

Similarly, b=211 is the next candidate.

Wait, perhaps b=230.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the minimal b is 230, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121, but as I saw, it's 8 solutions.

Wait, perhaps I can check for b=230.

Wait, (b -1)=229, which is a prime. So, the number of coprime factorizations is 2^1=2. So, only 2 solutions. That's not enough.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a b where (b -1) has 4 prime factors, but not necessarily the first four. For example, 2*2*3*3=36, but that has only 2 distinct primes. So, not enough.

Wait, the minimal (b -1) with 4 distinct prime factors is 210, so b=211.

But perhaps a smaller b exists with (b -1) having 4 distinct prime factors but with some exponents. For example, 2*3*5*7=210, so b=211.

Alternatively, perhaps a smaller b where (b -1) has more than 4 prime factors, but I don't think so because 210 is the minimal number with 4 distinct primes.

So, perhaps the minimal b is 211.

But wait, let's think about the number of solutions. For b=211, (b-1)=210.

Number of coprime factorizations is 16. So, 16 possible k's.

But each of these k's must satisfy k >=ceiling(sqrt(211))=15.

Given that k can be up to 210, it's likely that all 16 k's are valid, leading to 16 b-eautiful numbers.

But 16 is more than 10, so b=211 is a candidate.

But perhaps, a smaller b exists where (b -1) has 4 distinct prime factors, but b is smaller than 211.

Wait, but 210 is the smallest number with 4 distinct prime factors, so b=211 is the smallest b where (b -1) has 4 distinct prime factors.

But maybe a smaller b can have (b -1) with 4 prime factors, but not necessarily distinct. For example, 2^4*3*5=240. So, (b -1)=240, which has 3 distinct prime factors. So, number of coprime factorizations is 2^3=8. Still less than 10.

Wait, no, 8 is less than 10. So, that's not enough.

Wait, to get 2^t >10, t must be >=4, so 2^4=16.

So, the minimal (b -1) must have at least 4 distinct prime factors. So, 210 is the minimal such number.

Therefore, the minimal b is 211.

Wait, but let me confirm if for b=211, all 16 solutions are valid, i.e., k >=15.

Because for each coprime factorization, the solution k could be less than 15, but perhaps not.

Wait, let's take an example. Let's take a divisor d=1, m=210. Then, k ≡0 mod1 (always true) and k≡1 mod210. So, k=1 mod210. The smallest k is 1, which is less than 15, so it's invalid.

Similarly, for d=2, m=105. So, k ≡0 mod2 and k≡1 mod105. Let's solve this.

k ≡0 mod2
k ≡1 mod105

So, k=105t +1. We need k even, so 105t +1 must be even. Since 105 is odd, 105t is odd when t is odd, even when t is even. So, 105t +1 is even when t is odd.

So, the smallest t is 1: k=106.

Which is greater than 15, so valid.

Similarly, for d=3, m=70. Solve:

k ≡0 mod3
k ≡1 mod70

Let me write k=70t +1. We need 70t +1 ≡0 mod3.

70 ≡1 mod3, so 70t +1 ≡ t +1 ≡0 mod3 => t ≡2 mod3. So, t=3s +2.

Thus, k=70*(3s +2)+1=210s +141.

The smallest k is 141, which is >=15, so valid.

Similarly, for d=5, m=42.

k ≡0 mod5
k ≡1 mod42

Let me write k=42t +1. We need 42t +1 ≡0 mod5.

42 ≡2 mod5, so 2t +1 ≡0 mod5 => 2t≡-1≡4 mod5 => t≡2 mod5.

So, t=5s +2.

k=42*(5s +2)+1=210s +85.

The smallest k is 85, which is >=15, valid.

Similarly, for d=6, m=35.

k ≡0 mod6
k ≡1 mod35

k=35t +1. 35t +1 ≡0 mod6.

35≡5 mod6, so 5t +1≡0 mod6 =>5t≡-1≡5 mod6 =>t≡1 mod6.

So, t=6s +1.

k=35*(6s +1)+1=210s +36.

Smallest k=36, which is >=15, valid.

Continuing:

d=7, m=30.

k ≡0 mod7
k ≡1 mod30.

k=30t +1. 30t +1 ≡0 mod7.

30≡2 mod7, so 2t +1≡0 mod7 =>2t≡-1≡6 mod7 =>t≡3 mod7.

t=7s +3.

k=30*(7s +3)+1=210s +91.

k=91 is the smallest, which is >=15, valid.

d=10, m=21.

k ≡0 mod10
k ≡1 mod21.

k=21t +1. 21t +1 ≡0 mod10.

21≡1 mod10, so t +1 ≡0 mod10 =>t≡9 mod10.

t=10s +9.

k=21*(10s +9)+1=210s +190.

k=190 is the smallest, which is >=15, valid.

d=14, m=15.

k ≡0 mod14
k ≡1 mod15.

k=15t +1. 15t +1 ≡0 mod14.

15≡1 mod14, so t +1 ≡0 mod14 =>t≡13 mod14.

t=14s +13.

k=15*(14s +13)+1=210s +196.

k=196 is the smallest, which is >=15, valid.

d=15, m=14.

k ≡0 mod15
k ≡1 mod14.

k=14t +1. 14t +1 ≡0 mod15.

14≡-1 mod15, so (-1)t +1 ≡0 mod15 => -t +1≡0 =>t≡1 mod15.

t=15s +1.

k=14*(15s +1)+1=210s +15.

k=15 is the smallest, which is >=15, valid.

d=21, m=10.

k ≡0 mod21
k ≡1 mod10.

k=10t +1. 10t +1 ≡0 mod21.

10≡10 mod21, so 10t ≡-1 mod21 =>10t≡20 mod21.

Multiplying both sides by inverse of 10 mod21. The inverse of 10 mod21 is 19, since 10*19=190≡190-9*21=190-189=1 mod21.

So, t≡20*19 mod21 => t≡380 mod21.

380 /21=18*21=378, 380-378=2. So, t≡2 mod21.

t=21s +2.

k=10*(21s +2)+1=210s +21.

k=21 is the smallest, which is >=15, valid.

d=30, m=7.

k ≡0 mod30
k ≡1 mod7.

k=7t +1. 7t +1 ≡0 mod30.

7t≡-1 mod30 =>7t≡29 mod30.

Inverse of 7 mod30 is 13, since 7*13=91≡1 mod30.

So, t≡29*13 mod30.

29*13=377. 377 mod30: 30*12=360, 377-360=17. So, t≡17 mod30.

t=30s +17.

k=7*(30s +17)+1=210s +120.

k=120 is the smallest, which is >=15, valid.

d=35, m=6.

k ≡0 mod35
k ≡1 mod6.

k=6t +1. 6t +1 ≡0 mod35.

6t ≡-1 mod35 =>6t≡34 mod35.

Inverse of 6 mod35 is 6, since 6*6=36≡1 mod35.

So, t≡34*6=204≡204-5*35=204-175=29 mod35.

t=35s +29.

k=6*(35s +29)+1=210s +175.

k=175 is the smallest, which is >=15, valid.

d=42, m=5.

k ≡0 mod42
k ≡1 mod5.

k=5t +1. 5t +1 ≡0 mod42.

5t≡-1 mod42 =>5t≡41 mod42.

Inverse of 5 mod42 is 17, since 5*17=85≡1 mod42.

So, t≡41*17=697 mod42.

697 /42=16*42=672, 697-672=25. So, t≡25 mod42.

t=42s +25.

k=5*(42s +25)+1=210s +126.

k=126 is the smallest, which is >=15, valid.

d=70, m=3.

k ≡0 mod70
k ≡1 mod3.

k=3t +1. 3t +1 ≡0 mod70.

3t≡-1 mod70 =>3t≡69 mod70.

Inverse of 3 mod70 is 47, since 3*47=141≡1 mod70.

So, t≡69*47 mod70.

69*47=3243. 3243 /70=46*70=3220, 3243-3220=23. So, t≡23 mod70.

t=70s +23.

k=3*(70s +23)+1=210s +70.

k=70 is the smallest, which is >=15, valid.

d=105, m=2.

k ≡0 mod105
k ≡1 mod2.

So, k must be even +1, so odd. But k≡0 mod105 implies k is a multiple of 105, which is odd. So, the smallest k=105, which is >=15, valid.

d=210, m=1.

k ≡0 mod210
k ≡1 mod1.

Which is always true. So, k=210, which is >=15, valid.

Wait, but earlier when d=1, m=210, we had k=1, which is less than 15, so invalid. Similarly, for d=210, m=1, k=210, which is valid.

So, out of 16 factorizations:

- d=1, m=210: k=1 (invalid)
- d=210, m=1: k=210 (valid)
- The other 14 factorizations give k's that are >=15.

Wait, let me recount:

From the 16 factorizations:

- d=1, m=210: k=1 (invalid)
- d=2, m=105: k=106 (valid)
- d=3, m=70: k=141 (valid)
- d=5, m=42: k=85 (valid)
- d=6, m=35: k=36 (valid)
- d=7, m=30: k=91 (valid)
- d=10, m=21: k=190 (valid)
- d=14, m=15: k=196 (valid)
- d=15, m=14: k=15 (valid)
- d=21, m=10: k=21 (valid)
- d=30, m=7: k=120 (valid)
- d=35, m=6: k=175 (valid)
- d=42, m=5: k=126 (valid)
- d=70, m=3: k=70 (valid)
- d=105, m=2: k=105 (valid)
- d=210, m=1: k=210 (valid)

So, out of 16, only d=1 gives an invalid k=1. The rest 15 are valid. So, 15 solutions.

Wait, that's more than 10. So, b=211 has 15 b-eautiful numbers, which is more than 10. So, is 211 the minimal b?

But wait, let's check if there's a smaller b with (b -1) having 4 distinct prime factors, but not necessarily the first four. But 210 is the minimal such number. So, 211 is the minimal b.

Wait, but what about b=127. (b -1)=126=2*3^2*7. So, distinct prime factors: 2,3,7. So, t=3. Number of coprime factorizations is 8.

But 8<10, so not enough.

Similarly, b=121: (b-1)=120=2^3*3*5. t=3, number of solutions=8.

Not enough.

b=85: (b -1)=84=2^2*3*7. t=3, solutions=8.

Not enough.

b=67: (b -1)=66=2*3*11. t=3, solutions=8.

Still not enough.

b=43: (b -1)=42=2*3*7. t=3, solutions=8.

Not enough.

b=31: (b -1)=30=2*3*5. t=3, solutions=8.

Not enough.

b=23: (b -1)=22=2*11. t=2, solutions=4.

Not enough.

b=19: (b -1)=18=2*3^2. t=2, solutions=4.

Not enough.

So, the first b where (b -1) has 4 distinct prime factors is b=211, where (b -1)=210=2*3*5*7. So, t=4, number of coprime factorizations=16. But in reality, we have 15 valid solutions because one solution (k=1) is below the required range.

But 15 is more than 10, so b=211 is the minimal such b.

But wait, earlier, I thought that (b -1)=210, which is the minimal number with 4 distinct prime factors, so b=211 is the minimal base.

Wait, but let me double-check if there's a smaller b where (b -1) has 4 distinct prime factors.

Wait, 2*3*5*7=210. The next would be 2*3*5*7*11=2310, which is way bigger. So, 210 is indeed the minimal (b -1) with 4 distinct prime factors.

Thus, the minimal b is 211.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest integer \( b \geq 2 \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if it is a two-digit number in base \( b \) and the sum of its digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \). 

### Key Steps:
1. **Understanding \( b \)-eautiful Numbers**: A number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if:
   - \( n = d_1 \times b + d_2 \) where \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are digits in base \( b \).
   - \( d_1 + d_2 = \sqrt{n} \).
   - \( n \) must be a perfect square, say \( n = k^2 \).

2. **Equations and Constraints**:
   - From \( n = k^2 \), we get \( k^2 = d_1 \times b + d_2 \).
   - From \( d_1 + d_2 = k \), substituting \( d_2 = k - d_1 \) into the first equation gives \( k^2 = d_1 \times b + (k - d_1) \).
   - Simplifying, \( d_1 = \frac{k^2 - k}{b - 1} \), which must be an integer.

3. **Factorization Insight**: For \( d_1 \) to be an integer, \( b - 1 \) must divide \( k(k - 1) \). Since \( k \) and \( k - 1 \) are coprime, \( b - 1 \) must be a product of coprime factors dividing \( k \) and \( k - 1 \).

4. **Maximizing Solutions**: The number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers is linked to the number of coprime factorizations of \( b - 1 \). If \( b - 1 \) has \( t \) distinct prime factors, there are \( 2^t \) coprime factorizations. To exceed 10 solutions, \( 2^t > 10 \), so \( t \geq 4 \).

5. **Minimal \( b \)**: The smallest \( b - 1 \) with 4 distinct prime factors is \( 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 = 210 \). Thus, \( b = 211 \).

For \( b = 211 \), there are 15 valid \( b \)-eautiful numbers, exceeding the required count.

### Final Answer:
\boxed{211}
