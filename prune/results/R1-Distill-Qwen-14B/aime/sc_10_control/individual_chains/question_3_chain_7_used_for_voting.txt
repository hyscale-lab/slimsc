Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure out the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. Let me try to unpack the problem step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match all four of the randomly chosen numbers. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she has already won a prize. The answer should be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, P(A|B) is the probability of winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize.

But wait, if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize, right? Because winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), because if A happens, B must happen. Therefore, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to calculate two probabilities: the probability that Jen wins the grand prize (P(A)) and the probability that she wins any prize (P(B)). Then, divide P(A) by P(B) to get the conditional probability.

Let me start by calculating P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize.

The grand prize is awarded if all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. So, she has to pick all four correctly. The total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is the combination C(10,4). The number of favorable outcomes for the grand prize is just 1, because there's only one set of four numbers that matches exactly with her chosen numbers.

So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4). Let me compute C(10,4). That's 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7) / (4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Next, I need to find P(B), the probability that Jen wins a prize. Winning a prize means that at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. So, this includes cases where exactly two numbers match, exactly three match, or all four match. Since all four matching is the grand prize, which is already considered in P(A), but for P(B), it's the probability of at least two matches.

So, more formally, P(B) is the probability that the intersection between Jen's numbers and the randomly chosen numbers is at least two. Alternatively, the number of common numbers between her selection and the drawn numbers is ≥ 2.

To compute P(B), it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event (i.e., the probability that she doesn't win a prize) and subtract it from 1.

The complementary event is that she wins no prize, meaning that the number of common numbers between her selection and the drawn numbers is less than 2, i.e., 0 or 1.

Therefore, P(B) = 1 - P(no prize) = 1 - [P(0 matches) + P(1 match)].

So, let's compute P(0 matches) and P(1 match).

First, P(0 matches): the probability that none of Jen's numbers are chosen. That is, all four randomly chosen numbers are from the 6 numbers not chosen by Jen.

The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is 210, as before. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers none of which are in Jen's 4 is C(6,4), since there are 6 numbers not chosen. C(6,4) is 15. So, P(0 matches) = 15 / 210.

Next, P(1 match): the probability that exactly one of Jen's numbers is chosen, and the other three are from the remaining 6 numbers.

The number of ways to choose exactly 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 from the other 6 is C(4,1)*C(6,3). Let me compute that.

C(4,1) is 4. C(6,3) is 20. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 4*20 = 80. Therefore, P(1 match) = 80 / 210.

So, putting it together, P(no prize) = P(0 matches) + P(1 match) = (15 + 80)/210 = 95/210.

Therefore, P(B) = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210.

Wait, let me confirm that. 95 + 115 = 210, correct. So, P(B) is 115/210. Hmm, but let me check my calculations again to be sure.

Wait, C(6,3) is 20? Let me compute C(6,3): 6!/(3!3!) = (6*5*4)/(3*2*1) = 20. Yes, that's correct.

C(4,1) is 4, so 4*20=80. So, P(1 match) is 80/210. P(0 matches) is 15/210. So, 15+80=95, so yes, P(no prize) is 95/210, so P(B)=115/210.

Simplify 115/210: both divisible by 5? 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. Wait, 23 is prime, 42 is 2*3*7. So, yeah, 23 and 42 are coprime. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should hold off on simplifying until all steps are done.

Wait, but P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 115/210. So, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115. Because the denominators cancel out.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, the probability is 1/115. Therefore, m is 1, n is 115. So, m +n is 116.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating P(B). Let me recast it.

Alternatively, P(B) is the probability that at least two numbers match. So, it's equal to 1 - P(0 matches) - P(1 match), which is what I did. So, 1 - 15/210 -80/210= 1 -95/210=115/210.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the conditional probability is 1/210 divided by 115/210, which is 1/115.

Wait, but hold on, another way to think about it: the number of favorable outcomes for B is the number of ways where at least two numbers match. So, that would include choosing exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 of Jen's numbers. So, the number of favorable outcomes is C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0).

Let me compute that:

C(4,2)*C(6,2): that's 6 * 15=90.

C(4,3)*C(6,1): 4 *6=24.

C(4,4)*C(6,0): 1*1=1.

So, total favorable for B is 90 +24 +1=115.

So, the number of favorable is 115, so P(B)=115/210. So that's consistent with what I had earlier.

Therefore, P(A|B)= number of favorable for A divided by number of favorable for B. Because both are over the same denominator, the total combinations, so the conditional probability is 1/115.

Thus, m=1, n=115. Since 1 and 115 are coprime, m+n=1+115=116.

Wait a second, but before I conclude, let me check if I considered all the cases correctly.

In P(B), I considered exactly 2, 3, or 4 matches, which is correct for at least two matches.

In the alternative approach, I calculated the number of favorable for B as 115, which is same as 115/210. So, that's correct.

In P(A), it's exactly 4 matches, which is 1.

So, the conditional probability is 1/115, which reduces to 1/115. So, the answer is 1 + 115 = 116.

Hmm, seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.

To solve the problem, we need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem where we use the formula \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \).

1. **Calculate \( P(A) \), the probability of winning the grand prize:**
   - The grand prize is won if all four of Jen's numbers are chosen.
   - The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).
   - There is only 1 favorable outcome for winning the grand prize.
   - Thus, \( P(A) = \frac{1}{210} \).

2. **Calculate \( P(B) \), the probability of winning a prize:**
   - Winning a prize means at least two of Jen's numbers match the chosen numbers. This includes exactly 2, 3, or 4 matches.
   - Calculate the complementary probability (no prize) by finding the probability of 0 or 1 matches.
     - **0 matches:** All 4 chosen numbers are from the 6 not chosen by Jen. The number of ways is \( \binom{6}{4} = 15 \). Thus, \( P(0 \text{ matches}) = \frac{15}{210} \).
     - **1 match:** Choose 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 from the remaining 6. The number of ways is \( \binom{4}{1} \times \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \). Thus, \( P(1 \text{ match}) = \frac{80}{210} \).
   - The total probability of no prize is \( \frac{15 + 80}{210} = \frac{95}{210} \).
   - Therefore, \( P(B) = 1 - \frac{95}{210} = \frac{115}{210} \).

3. **Calculate the conditional probability \( P(A|B) \):**
   - \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115} \).

4. **Simplify the fraction and find \( m + n \):**
   - The fraction \( \frac{1}{115} \) is already in simplest form with \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \).
   - Thus, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

The final answer is \( \boxed{116} \).
