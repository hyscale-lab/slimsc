Okay, let's see. I have this math problem about Aya's morning walk. So, every morning she walks 9 kilometers. Hmm. She walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, and the total time she takes, including coffee shop time, is 4 hours. Then, when she walks a bit faster, at s + 2 km/h, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, still including the same coffee shop time t. Then, the question is asking, what's the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including t minutes again.

Alright, so I need to find the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h. But first, I probably need to figure out what s is. Because without knowing her original speed, I can't find the new time.

Let me note down the given information.

First scenario:
- Distance walked: 9 km
- Speed: s km/h
- Total time: 4 hours. This includes walking time plus t minutes in the coffee shop.

Second scenario:
- Distance walked: 9 km
- Speed: s + 2 km/h
- Total time: 2 hours and 24 minutes. Again, which includes walking time plus t minutes.

So, the difference in total time is because she's walking faster. The time spent in the coffee shop is the same in both cases, which is t minutes.

Wait, but time is given in hours and minutes. Maybe I should convert everything into hours or minutes to make it easier. Let me choose hours.

So, 4 hours is straightforward. 2 hours and 24 minutes... Hmm, 24 minutes is 24/60 hours, which is 0.4 hours. So 2.4 hours.

So, the total time in the first case is 4 hours, which is the walking time plus t minutes (which I can convert to hours). Similarly, the second case is 2.4 hours, which is walking time plus t.

Wait, actually, since the total time includes t minutes, the time spent walking is total time minus t. So, in the first scenario, walking time is 4 hours minus t/60 hours. Because t is in minutes, so to convert to hours, it's t divided by 60.

Similarly, in the second scenario, walking time is 2.4 hours minus t/60 hours.

But walking time is also equal to distance divided by speed. So, for the first scenario, walking time is 9 km divided by s km/h, which would be 9/s hours.

So, let me write the equations:

Equation 1: 9/s = 4 - t/60

Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60

So, I have two equations with two variables, s and t. I can solve these equations to find s and t.

Let me write them again:

1) 9/s = 4 - (t/60)

2) 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

Hmm, maybe I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 or find a way to eliminate t.

Alternatively, let me subtract the two equations. Let's see:

Equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4

Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

If I subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

(9/s + t/60) - (9/(s + 2) + t/60) = 4 - 2.4

Simplify:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Because the t/60 terms cancel out.

So, 9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Let me compute that:

Factor out 9: 9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Compute the expression inside the brackets:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [ (s + 2) - s ] / [ s(s + 2) ) ] = 2 / [ s(s + 2) ]

So, substituting back:

9 * [ 2 / (s(s + 2)) ] = 1.6

Simplify:

18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

So, 18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

Let me compute 1.6 times s(s + 2):

1.6 s(s + 2) = 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s

So, 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s = 18

Divide both sides by 1.6 to simplify:

s^2 + 2 s = 11.25

So, s^2 + 2 s - 11.25 = 0

Now, this is a quadratic equation in s. Let me write it as:

s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

To solve for s, use the quadratic formula:

s = [ -b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac) ] / (2a)

Here, a = 1, b = 2, c = -11.25

Discriminant D = b² - 4ac = 4 + 45 = 49

So, sqrt(D) = 7

So, solutions:

s = [ -2 ± 7 ] / 2

We have two solutions:

s = (5)/2 = 2.5

s = (-9)/2 = -4.5

But speed can't be negative, so s = 2.5 km/h

Wait, that seems quite slow for a walking speed. 2.5 km/h is about 1.55 miles per hour, which is a leisurely stroll, but okay, maybe it's correct.

Let me check if this makes sense.

So, s = 2.5 km/h.

Then, s + 2 = 4.5 km/h.

So, let's compute the walking times.

First scenario: 9 km at 2.5 km/h.

Time = 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours, which is 3 hours and 36 minutes.

But the total time, including coffee, is 4 hours. So, the coffee time t would be 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 hours, which is 24 minutes.

Wait, so t is 24 minutes.

Let me check the second scenario.

9 km at 4.5 km/h.

Time = 9 / 4.5 = 2 hours.

Total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which matches the given information. So yes, t is 24 minutes.

So, s is 2.5 km/h, t is 24 minutes.

Now, the question is, when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

So, her speed is 3 km/h.

What is the total time, including t minutes?

So, first, compute the walking time: 9 km / 3 km/h = 3 hours.

So, walking time is 3 hours, plus t minutes, which is 24 minutes.

Total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes.

But the question asks for the number of minutes, including t.

So, 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 204 minutes.

Wait, that can't be right because when she walks faster, the time should be less than 4 hours. Wait, no, 3 hours and 24 minutes is less than 4 hours. Wait, in the first case, she took 4 hours, in the second case, 2 hours 24 minutes, and in this third case, 3 hours 24 minutes. So it's in between the two.

Wait, but wait, when she goes from 2.5 to 4.5, her time decreases from 4 hours to 2.4 hours. So, when she walks at 3 km/h, which is faster than 2.5 but slower than 4.5, the time should be between 2.4 hours (2h24m) and 4 hours.

Wait, 3 hours 24 minutes is 3.4 hours, which is indeed between 2.4 and 4. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the time as 3 hours walking, plus 24 minutes coffee, so 3*60 +24 = 180 +24 = 204 minutes.

So the answer is 204 minutes. So, the integer answer is 204.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations.

s=2.5, so walking at 3 km/h.

Walking time: 9/3 = 3 hours.

Coffee time: 24 minutes.

Total: 3h 24m = 204 minutes.

Yes, that's correct.

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given scenarios:

1. **First Scenario:**
   - **Speed:** \( s \) km/h
   - **Total Time:** 4 hours (includes walking time and \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop)
   - **Walking Time:** \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours
   - **Equation:** \( \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \)

2. **Second Scenario:**
   - **Speed:** \( s + 2 \) km/h
   - **Total Time:** 2 hours and 24 minutes (which is 2.4 hours)
   - **Walking Time:** \( \frac{9}{s + 2} \) hours
   - **Equation:** \( \frac{9}{s + 2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4 \)

Subtracting the second equation from the first to eliminate \( t \):
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s + 2} = 4 - 2.4
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s + 2} = 1.6
\]
\[
9 \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s + 2} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
9 \left( \frac{2}{s(s + 2)} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
\frac{18}{s(s + 2)} = 1.6
\]
\[
18 = 1.6 s(s + 2)
\]
\[
1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0
\]
Dividing by 1.6:
\[
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
\]
Solving the quadratic equation:
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
Taking the positive root:
\[
s = 2.5 \, \text{km/h}
\]

From the first scenario, the walking time is:
\[
\frac{9}{2.5} = 3.6 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours and 36 minutes}
\]
The total time is 4 hours, so \( t = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 \, \text{hours} = 24 \, \text{minutes} \).

**Third Scenario:**
- **Speed:** \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \, \text{km/h} \)
- **Walking Time:** \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \, \text{hours} \)
- **Total Time:** \( 3 \, \text{hours} + 24 \, \text{minutes} = 3 \, \text{hours and 24 minutes} \)
- **Convert to Minutes:** \( 3 \times 60 + 24 = 204 \, \text{minutes} \)

The number of minutes the walk takes her, including the coffee shop time, is \(\boxed{204}\).
