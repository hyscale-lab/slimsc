Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, starting with Alice. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm. Let's think about this. It's a turn-based game, so the key is to figure out the winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win regardless of what the opponent does. A losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, the first step is to model this using dynamic programming or perhaps by finding a pattern in the winning and losing positions.

Let me try to list out some small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.

n=1: Alice can take 1 token and win. So Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a losing position for Bob.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob can then take that 1 token and win. Wait, but if Alice takes 1, Bob wins. Alternatively, Alice could take 4 tokens, but that's not possible here since n=2. So Alice has only one option: take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So n=2 is a winning position for Bob? Wait, no. Wait, the player who takes the last token wins. So if n=2, Alice takes 1, leaving 1, then Bob takes 1 and wins. So in this case, Bob can win. So when n=2, Bob can win? Wait, but Alice is going first. So for n=2, Alice can choose to take 1, leaving 1, forcing Bob to take it and win. But wait, that would mean Alice loses. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob. So Bob can win when n=2.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify: when n=2, Alice's options are to take 1 or 4. She can't take 4 because there are only 2 tokens. So she takes 1, leaving 1. Then Bob takes the last one and wins. So yes, for n=2, Bob can win.

n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving 2. Then Bob is in a position where he can take 1, leaving 1 for Alice, but then Alice would take it and win. Wait, no. Wait, let's think step by step.

n=3: Alice takes 1, leaving 2. Now Bob's turn. Bob can take 1 or 4. He can't take 4, so he takes 1, leaving 1. Then Alice takes the last one and wins. So Bob loses if Alice takes 1. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4, which she can't, because n=3. So Alice has to take 1, leaving 2 for Bob. Then Bob takes 1, leaving 1 for Alice, who then takes it and wins. So Bob can't win at n=3. So n=3 is a losing position for Bob, meaning Alice can win.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let's go step by step:

n=3:

- Alice's options: take 1, leaving 2.

Bob's turn:

- n=2: Bob can take 1, leaving 1, then Alice takes 1 and wins.

So Bob, when faced with n=2, can't force a win because whatever he does, Alice can take the last one.

Wait, but earlier I thought n=2 is a winning position for Bob. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should model this properly, assigning each n as a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

Let's start from n=0: that's the base case. If n=0, the game is over, so the player who just moved wins. So n=0 is a losing position for the current player because they can't move.

n=1: The current player can take 1 and win, so n=1 is W.

n=2: Current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then win by taking that 1. So if the current player takes 1, opponent wins. Alternatively, can the current player take 4? No, because n=2. So n=2 is W or L?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. For n=2, the current player can take 1, leaving 1. The opponent can then take 1 and win. So if the current player takes 1, the opponent wins. Alternatively, is there another option? No, because 4 is too big. So the current player can't force a win, so n=2 is L.

Wait, that can't be right. Because for n=2, if it's your turn, you can take 1, but then the opponent takes the last one and wins. So you lose. So n=2 is L.

Wait, but earlier, when n=2, I thought Bob could win. But maybe I was wrong.

Wait, let me clarify.

In the problem, Alice is the first player. So for n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So Bob can win when n=2. So that would mean that when n=2, it's a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So in terms of positions, n=2 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is. So from Alice's perspective, when n=2, it's a losing position, so Bob can win.

Wait, but perhaps I'm mixing up who is the current player. Let me think again.

I think the correct approach is to model each n as a position where the next player to move can win (W) or cannot (L). So for each n, if the next player can make a move that leads the opponent into a losing position, then n is W. Otherwise, it's L.

So let's redo this.

n=0: losing (L) because you can't move.

n=1: you can take 1, so W.

n=2: Your options are to take 1, leading to n=1 (W for the opponent) or take 4 (which isn't possible). So if you take 1, opponent is at n=1, which is a W for them. So you can't force the opponent into an L position. So n=2 is L.

n=3: Your options are take 1 (leading to n=2, which is L for the opponent) or take 4 (can't). So if you take 1, opponent is at n=2, which is L. So n=3 is W.

n=4: You can take 1, leading to n=3 (W for opponent), or take 4, leading to n=0 (L for opponent). So taking 4 forces opponent into L, so n=4 is W.

n=5: You can take 1 → n=4 (W), or take 4 → n=1 (W). So no matter what you do, opponent is at W. So n=5 is L.

n=6: Take 1 → n=5 (L), so n=6 is W.

n=7: Take 1 → n=6 (W), or take 4 → n=3 (W). So both options lead to W for opponent. So n=7 is L.

Wait, no. Wait, if you take 4 from n=7, you get n=3, which is W for the opponent, meaning opponent can win. So both options leave the opponent in a W position. So n=7 is L.

n=8: Take 1 → n=7 (L), so n=8 is W.

n=9: Take 1 → n=8 (W), or take 4 → n=5 (L). So taking 4 leads opponent to L, so n=9 is W.

Wait, but if you take 4 from n=9, you get n=5, which is L, so the opponent can't win. So n=9 is W.

n=10: Take 1 → n=9 (W), or take 4 → n=6 (W). Both options lead to W for opponent, so n=10 is L.

Wait, but n=6 is W, so opponent can win from there. So n=10 is L.

Hmm, so let's list these out:

n | W/L
0 | L
1 | W
2 | L
3 | W
4 | W
5 | L
6 | W
7 | L
8 | W
9 | W
10| L
11| ?

Wait, let's see if a pattern is emerging.

Looking at the W and L positions:

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
W/L: L W L W W L W L W W L

Wait, perhaps the pattern repeats every 5? Let's check n=11.

n=11: Take 1 → n=10 (L), so n=11 is W.

n=12: Take 1 → n=11 (W), or take 4 → n=8 (W). So both options leave opponent at W. So n=12 is L.

n=13: Take 1 → n=12 (L), so n=13 is W.

n=14: Take 1 → n=13 (W), or take 4 → n=10 (L). So taking 4 leads to L, so n=14 is W.

n=15: Take 1 → n=14 (W), take 4 → n=11 (W). Both lead to W, so n=15 is L.

Wait, so from n=10 onwards, the pattern seems to be:

n=10 → L

n=11 → W

n=12 → L

n=13 → W

n=14 → W

n=15 → L

n=16: take 1 → n=15 (L), so W.

n=17: take 1 → n=16 (W), take 4 → n=13 (W). So n=17 is L.

Hmm, maybe the pattern is not every 5, but perhaps a cycle of 5, but let's see.

Looking at the positions from n=0 to n=15:

0: L

1: W

2: L

3: W

4: W

5: L

6: W

7: L

8: W

9: W

10: L

11: W

12: L

13: W

14: W

15: L

So, the pattern from n=5 onwards seems to be L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L...

Wait, let's see the positions from n=5:

n=5: L

n=6: W

n=7: L

n=8: W

n=9: W

n=10: L

n=11: W

n=12: L

n=13: W

n=14: W

n=15: L

n=16: W

n=17: L

n=18: W

n=19: W

n=20: L

So every 5 numbers, the pattern repeats with L, W, L, W, W.

So from n=5, the cycle is L, W, L, W, W.

So for n=5k, it's L.

n=5k+1: W

n=5k+2: L

n=5k+3: W

n=5k+4: W

n=5(k+1): L

Yes, that seems to hold.

So, the losing positions (where the current player cannot win) are at n=0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... So every 5 steps, the losing positions are at n=0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17, etc.

Wait, let's see: the losing positions are at n=0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,...

So the positions where n ≡ 0 mod 5, n=5k, are losing.

Wait, but wait, n=5 is losing, n=10 is losing, n=15 is losing, etc. So n=5k is L.

Additionally, n=2,7,12,17,22,... So n=5k-3? Because 5k-3: when k=1, 5*1-3=2; k=2, 5*2-3=7; k=3, 5*3-3=12; etc.

So n=5k and n=5k-3 are losing positions.

Wait, let me check:

At n=5k: L

n=5k-3: L

So for example, k=1: n=2 (5*1-3=2), L.

k=2: n=5, L.

k=3: n=7 (5*2=10? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

Wait, let's see the losing positions:

n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,...

So the losing positions are at n ≡ 0 mod 5 and n ≡ 2 mod 5.

Wait, n=0 mod5: 0,5,10,15,20,...

n=2 mod5: 2,7,12,17,22,...

Yes, that seems right.

So the losing positions are all n where n ≡ 0 or 2 mod5.

So n mod5 is 0 or 2.

So for n=5k or n=5k+2, the position is losing for the current player.

So, in the context of the problem, Alice is the first player. So if the starting n is a losing position, then Bob can win. Otherwise, Alice can win.

So we need to count the numbers n ≤2024 where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So the problem reduces to finding the number of integers ≤2024 that are ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So the count is equal to the number of numbers ≤2024, n ≡0 mod5 plus the number of numbers ≤2024, n≡2 mod5.

Let me compute each.

First, numbers ≤2024 where n ≡0 mod5.

The largest such number is 2020, since 2024 ÷5=404.8, so 5*404=2020.

Number of terms: 404 +1=405 (since 0 is included, but n is positive, so starting from 5, 10,...2020.

Wait, n is positive integers, so n=5,10,...2020.

Number of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1= (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.

Wait, 5*404=2020. So from n=5 to n=2020, step 5: 404 terms.

Similarly, for n≡2 mod5.

Numbers ≤2024 where n≡2 mod5.

The largest such number is 2022, because 2024 mod5 is 2024-5*404=2024-2020=4, so 2022=5*404 +2=2022.

So the numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022.

Number of terms: Let's compute.

The sequence starts at 2, ends at 2022, step 5.

Number of terms: ((2022 -2)/5) +1 = (2020/5)+1=404 +1=405.

Wait, 2022=2 +5*(n-1). So n-1=(2022-2)/5=2020/5=404. So n=405.

So the count is 405 for n≡2 mod5.

So total losing positions for Alice (so Bob can win) are 404 (for n≡0) +405 (for n≡2) =809.

Wait, 404+405=809.

But let me check the counts again.

Wait, for n≡0 mod5: numbers are 5,10,...2020. How many terms?

The formula is (last - first)/step +1.

(2020 -5)/5 +1= (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.

Yes.

For n≡2 mod5: numbers are 2,7,12,...2022.

(2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.

Yes.

So total is 404 +405=809.

But wait, let's check if 2024 is included in either.

2024 mod5: 2024 ÷5 is 404*5=2020, remainder 4. So 2024≡4 mod5, which is neither 0 nor 2, so it's not included.

So the total numbers ≤2024 where n≡0 or 2 mod5 is 809.

So the answer should be 809.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm counting correctly.

Wait, the problem says "positive integers n ≤2024", so n starts at 1.

n=0 is not included because it's not positive. So for n≡0 mod5, the first n is 5, then 10, etc., up to 2020.

n=2020 is 5*404=2020.

So that's 404 numbers.

n=2,7,...,2022: 405 numbers.

Total 809.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alice and Bob play a game with a stack of $n$ tokens. Alice goes first, and each player can remove 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. The player who removes the last token wins. We need to determine how many positive integers $n \leq 2024$ allow Bob to guarantee a win regardless of Alice's moves.

To solve this, we identify the winning (W) and losing (L) positions for the current player. A position is losing if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. Through analysis, we find that the losing positions occur at $n \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$ and $n \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$. 

For $n \leq 2024$:
- The numbers congruent to 0 modulo 5 are 5, 10, ..., 2020, totaling 404 numbers.
- The numbers congruent to 2 modulo 5 are 2, 7, ..., 2022, totaling 405 numbers.

Adding these, there are $404 + 405 = 809$ losing positions where Bob can guarantee a win.

$\boxed{809}$
