Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents of Aimeville and the things they own. It seems like a problem involving sets and maybe using some principles like inclusion-exclusion. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

First, let's list out all the given information to make sure I don't miss anything. There are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's one thing everyone has. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers of owners are 195, 367, and 562 respectively.

Additionally, we know that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four items—so that's the candy hearts plus the other three things.

Wait, but since everyone owns the candy hearts, does that mean that all the other ownerships are subsets of those 900? So, the diamond ring owners, golf clubs owners, and garden spade owners are all subsets of the 900. Okay, that makes sense.

I think I need to model this with sets. Let me denote the sets as follows:

- Let C be the set of residents who own a candy heart. So, |C| = 900.

- Let D be the set who own a diamond ring, so |D| = 195.

- Let G be those who own golf clubs, so |G| = 367.

- Let S be the set with garden spades, so |S| = 562.

And then, each resident owns at least the candy heart, so all these sets D, G, S are subsets of C.

We're told that:

- Number of people owning exactly two things: 437.

- Number owning exactly three things: 234.

And we need to find the number owning all four things, which would be the intersection of D, G, S, and C. Wait, but since everyone owns C, that's redundant. So, the number we're looking for is |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Hmm, but wait, actually, because ownership is of four items, with C being a given. So, ownership of all four would be the same as owning D, G, S, and C. But since C is universal, it's the same as owning D, G, and S. So, we can model this as the intersection of D, G, and S.

Now, I think the inclusion-exclusion principle can help here. Let me recall the formula for four sets, but wait, in this case, since C is universal, we can adjust the problem accordingly.

Wait, the problem is, the three specific items (D, G, S) along with C, which is always present. So, each resident owns at least C. So, the other items are just additional.

But the problem is about the number of people who own exactly two, exactly three, or all four. But since C is a given, when they say someone owns exactly two things, that would be C plus one of the others, right? Because they must have C. Wait, no, actually, is that the case?

Wait, no, maybe not. Because the problem says, "each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts." So, every resident has C. So, when it mentions someone owning, say, a diamond ring and a set of golf clubs, that is in addition to C. Therefore, when the problem says "437 residents own exactly two of these things," it includes C as one of the things. So, someone who owns C and D would be someone owning exactly two things. Similarly, someone owning C, D, and G would be owning exactly three.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.

It says, "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." Then, "there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things." The "these things" probably refers to the four things: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, when someone owns exactly two of these, that includes C possibly. So, that changes things. So, the ownership is counted across all four items, including C.

Wait, but C is given to everyone, so when considering ownership of exactly two things, that could include C and one other. Or two others, but since C is always present, you can't have someone owning exactly two things without C, because they must have C. Wait, no, because "each of the 900" owns C. So, everyone has C. Therefore, if someone owns exactly two things, those two things must include C and one other. Similarly, someone owning three things would have C plus two others, and someone owning all four would have all three plus C.

Wait, but wait, that would mean:

- Exactly two things: C and one other (D, G, or S).

- Exactly three things: C and two others.

- Exactly four things: C and all three others.

But the problem states that 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. So, the total number of people who own exactly two is 437, and exactly three is 234. But perhaps the problem is considering the four things (C, D, G, S), so that someone can own any combination, including C. So, the count includes C in the possible ownerships.

But since C is given to everyone, perhaps the way to model this is to consider the problem in terms of the four sets. But since C is universal, it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the problem as having four items, but since everyone has C, the problem reduces to considering the other three items, D, G, S, but with the understanding that C is always present.

Wait, but no, because the problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so C is a given. So, when the problem says "437 residents own exactly two of these things," that would include C as one of the two. So, for example, someone could have C and D, and that's two things. Or C and G, or C and S.

Similarly, someone with exactly three things would have C plus two others, like D, G, or S, etc.

So, in this case, the problem is similar to a three-set inclusion-exclusion problem, but we have to think in terms of four items, with C being always present.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the three non-C items, but considering that everyone has C, which complicates things.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to model this properly.

Let me denote:

- Let the four items be C, D, G, S.

- Every resident has C.

- Some have D, some have G, some have S.

- The counts of exactly two things, exactly three things are given.

We need to find the number of residents who have all four, which is |D ∩ G ∩ S|, since C is already included.

Wait, but maybe not. Let's think.

If a resident has exactly two things, it's C plus either D, G, or S. So, the number of residents with exactly two things is the sum of the residents who have C and D but not G or S, plus those with C and G but not D or S, plus those with C and S but not D or G.

Similarly, for exactly three things: they have C plus two of D, G, S.

And for exactly four things: they have all four, so C, D, G, S.

Wait, no: but since C is always present, the counts for exactly two, three, and four are all based on the other three items plus C.

So, the total number of residents is 900, which is the sum of:

- Number owning exactly one thing (but since everyone owns C, the only way to own exactly one thing is to own only C. But the problem doesn't mention the number of people owning exactly one thing. Hmm, perhaps I need to consider that.

Wait, but the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's one thing. But some own more. So, the total number of residents is the sum of those owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four things.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's given that 437 own exactly two, 234 own exactly three. So, the number owning exactly four is what we're trying to find. But we don't know the number owning exactly one. Let me denote:

Let’s define:

- a: number of people owning exactly one thing (which would be only C, since everyone has C).

- b: exactly two things (437).

- c: exactly three things (234).

- d: exactly four things (unknown, which we'll call x).

So, the total number of residents is a + b + c + d = 900.

We have b = 437, c = 234, so 437 + 234 = 671, so a + d = 900 - 671 = 229.

So, a + d = 229.

But we don't know a or d yet.

But perhaps we can find another equation using the inclusion-exclusion principle.

We know the number of people owning D, G, and S.

So, |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562.

Each of these counts includes all the people who own that item, regardless of how many other items they own. So, the count of D includes those who have D and nothing else, those who have D and one other, up to those who have D and all the others.

But since everyone has C, let me think about how these counts relate to a, b, c, d.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this using the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets (since C is universal and perhaps factored in elsewhere).

Wait, but perhaps another approach is better.

Let me denote:

- Let D only be those who own exactly C and D.

Similarly, G only: C and G.

S only: C and S.

Then, the people owning exactly two things (b=437) would be the sum of D only, G only, S only, and those who own two of D, G, S plus C.

Wait, no, because 'exactly two' includes those who have C and one other, and those who have two others plus C.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the Venn diagram for three sets (D, G, S), with each set being a subset of C.

In this case, the number of people in exactly two of the D, G, S would be the sum of the pairwise intersections minus three times the triple intersection.

But since the problem is about exactly two things (including C), this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion principle can be applied to the three sets D, G, S, and then account for the overlaps, considering that everyone has C.

Wait, let's think about it.

The total number of people owning D, G, or S is |D ∪ G ∪ S|.

But since everyone owns C, |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - a, where a is the number of people who don't own D, G, or S. But since a is the number of people who own exactly one thing (only C), and the rest own C plus some combination of D, G, S.

But we don't know a yet.

Alternatively, perhaps using the inclusion-exclusion formula for the union of D, G, S:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

But |D ∪ G ∪ S| is equal to the number of people who own at least one of D, G, S. But since everyone owns C, the number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to 900 minus a, where a is the number of people who own only C. So,

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - a.

But from the inclusion-exclusion formula,

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

So, 900 - a = 195 + 367 + 562 - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Let me compute 195 + 367 + 562: that's 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124. So,

900 - a = 1124 - (|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) + |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Hmm, but I don't know the values of |D ∩ G|, |D ∩ S|, |G ∩ S|. However, maybe I can relate these to the values of exactly two and exactly three.

Wait, the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S, along with C, is 437. Let's think about that.

The number of people who own exactly two of D, G, S is equal to the sum of the pairwise intersections minus three times the triple intersection. Because, for three sets, the number of people in exactly two is |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| - 3|D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Wait, let me confirm that. For three sets, the number of elements in exactly two of the sets is the sum of the pairwise intersections minus three times the triple intersection. Because |D ∩ G| includes those who are also in S, so we subtract 3 times the triple intersection to get exactly those in exactly two sets.

So, in this case, the number of residents owning exactly two of D, G, S, plus C, is 437. So, exactly two of D, G, S would be |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| - 3|D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Wait, no, because each of those pairwise intersections includes those who are also in all three. So, to get exactly two, you subtract three times the triple intersection. So,

Number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S: |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| - 3|D ∩ G ∩ S|.

And this equals 437.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three of D, G, S is |D ∩ G ∩ S|, which is 234.

Wait, but wait, the problem says 234 own exactly three of these things. But since C is always present, that would mean exactly three things including C. So, the exactly three would be C plus D, G, S. So, the number of people owning exactly three of the four things is the number of people owning C plus all three of D, G, S. So, this is exactly |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

So, |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 234.

Wait, that's a key point. So, the number of people who own exactly three things is |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 234.

So, that's our x, the number of people owning all four things, which is 234.

Wait, no, because exactly three things would include C and all three of D, G, S. So, the count is 234.

But earlier, I thought |D ∩ G ∩ S| is the number of people owning all three, which is 234. So, that's the number of people owning exactly four things, because they have C as well. So, the number of people owning all four is 234.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem states that 234 residents own exactly three of these things. Since C is always present, those 234 would have C plus exactly two of D, G, S. Wait, no, if they own exactly three things, and C is one, then they must have two more. So, |D ∩ G ∩ S| would represent the people who have all four. Wait, no, that can't be, because |D ∩ G ∩ S| includes all who have D, G, S, which would be the people who have all three plus C. So, that would be the exactly four count.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Each resident must have C, so when considering the number of things they own, it's based on how many of D, G, S they have in addition to C. So:

- Exactly one thing: only C. So, a = number of people with only C.

- Exactly two things: C plus one of D, G, S. So, the count is |C ∩ D| + |C ∩ G| + |C ∩ S| - 3|C ∩ D ∩ G ∩ S|? Wait, no, perhaps another approach.

Wait, perhaps the number of people owning exactly two things is the sum of those owning C and D only, C and G only, C and S only. So, if I denote:

- |C ∩ D only| = number of people owning only C and D.

Similarly, |C ∩ G only| and |C ∩ S only|.

Then, the number of people owning exactly two things is the sum of these three.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three things is |C ∩ D ∩ G| + |C ∩ D ∩ S| + |C ∩ G ∩ S| - 3|C ∩ D ∩ G ∩ S|? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think that exactly three things would be C plus two of D, G, S. So, the count is:

|C ∩ D ∩ G| + |C ∩ D ∩ S| + |C ∩ G ∩ S|.

But wait, each of these intersections includes those who also have all three, so to get exactly three, we need to subtract the people who have all four. But since everyone has C, the all four is |C ∩ D ∩ G ∩ S| = |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

So, the number of people owning exactly three things (C plus two others) is:

(|C ∩ D ∩ G| + |C ∩ D ∩ S| + |C ∩ G ∩ S|) - 3|D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should use the inclusion-exclusion principle more systematically.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as four sets, but since C is universal, we can consider only the other three sets D, G, S, and know that everyone is in C. So, perhaps the problem reduces to three sets with a universal set.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the total number of people in terms of the exactly one, two, three, four.

Wait, let me try this approach.

Let me denote:

- a: number of people owning exactly 1 thing (only C).

- b: exactly two things (C and one of D, G, S).

- c: exactly three things (C and two of D, G, S).

- d: exactly four things (C, D, G, S).

We know that:

a + b + c + d = 900.

We are given that:

b = 437,

c = 234,

So, a + d = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.

So, a + d = 229.

Now, we can think about the counts for D, G, S.

Each of these counts includes all the people who have them, regardless of how many other things they have.

So, |D| = 195 includes:

- Those who have only D and C (part of b),

- Those who have D, C, and one other (part of c),

- Those who have D, C, and all three others (part of d).

Similarly for |G| and |S|.

So, for |D|:

|D| = number of people with D and C only (part of b) + those with D, C, and one other (part of c) + those with D, C, and all three others (part of d).

But wait, since d is the number of people with all four, which includes D, G, S, and C.

So, |D| = (number of people with only D and C) + (number with D, C, and one other) + d.

Similarly, |G| = (number with only G and C) + (number with G, C, and one other) + d.

Same for |S|.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider that:

The number of people owning exactly k things is a, b, c, d, and we can express the total counts for D, G, S in terms of these.

So, for |D|, the number of people owning D is:

- The number of people with exactly two things that include D: which is the number of people owning C and D only (part of b) plus those owning C, D, and one other (part of c) plus those owning all four (d).

Wait, no. Let me correct that.

Wait, when we say someone owns exactly two things, and one of them is D, they must have C and D.

Similarly, someone owning exactly three things and D must have C, D, and one other (either G or S).

And someone owning all four things would have C, D, G, S.

So, |D| is equal to:

(number of people with exactly two things and D) + (number with exactly three things and D) + (number with exactly four things).

But the number of people with exactly two things and D is the number of people who have exactly C and D, which is part of b. Let's denote this as b_D.

Similarly, the number of people with exactly three things and D is the number of people who have exactly C, D, and one other (either G or S), which would be part of c. Let's denote this as c_D.

And the number of people with exactly four things is d.

So, |D| = b_D + c_D + d.

Similarly for |G| and |S|.

But without knowing b_D, c_D, etc., it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the total number of people owning D, G, S in terms of a, b, c, d.

Wait, another approach: The sum of the individual counts |D| + |G| + |S| can be expressed as the sum of the people owning each of these items, considering all the combinations.

Each |D| is the number of people who have D and any combination of the other items, including C.

So, |D| = number of people with exactly D and C (b_D) + those with exactly D, C, and G (c_{DG}) + those with exactly D, C, and S (c_{DS}) + those with all four (d).

Similarly, |G| = b_G + c_{DG} + c_{GS} + d,

and |S| = b_S + c_{DS} + c_{GS} + d.

But this seems complicated because we have multiple variables.

Alternatively, since we know the total number of people with exactly two things is 437, which includes those with C and D, C and G, C and S.

So, let me denote:

b_D: number of people with exactly C and D,

b_G: exactly C and G,

b_S: exactly C and S.

So, b = b_D + b_G + b_S = 437.

Similarly, the number of people with exactly three things is 234, which includes:

c_{DGS}: exactly C, D, and G,

c_{DSS}: exactly C, D, and S,

c_{GSS}: exactly C, G, and S.

Wait, but maybe it's better to denote it as c_{D,G}, c_{D,S}, c_{G,S}.

But perhaps since the problem is symmetric, we can denote the number of people with exactly three things as c, which is 234. So, c = c_{D,G} + c_{D,S} + c_{G,S} = 234.

Wait, but each of these c_{X,Y} counts includes those who have exactly C, X, Y, but not Z. So, for three sets, the number of people with exactly two of D, G, S is b = 437, which is the sum of b_D + b_G + b_S.

And the number of people with exactly three of D, G, S is c = 234, which is the sum of c_{D,G} + c_{D,S} + c_{G,S}.

Now, the total number of people owning D is:

|D| = b_D + c_{D,G} + c_{D,S} + d,

where d is the number of people owning all four.

Similarly,

|G| = b_G + c_{D,G} + c_{G,S} + d,

|S| = b_S + c_{D,S} + c_{G,S} + d.

So, summing |D| + |G| + |S|:

= (b_D + c_{D,G} + c_{D,S} + d) + (b_G + c_{D,G} + c_{G,S} + d) + (b_S + c_{D,S} + c_{G,S} + d).

Simplify:

= (b_D + b_G + b_S) + 2(c_{D,G} + c_{D,S} + c_{G,S}) ) + 3d.

But we know that:

b_D + b_G + b_S = 437,

c_{D,G} + c_{D,S} + c_{G,S} = 234.

So,

|D| + |G| + |S| = 437 + 2*234 + 3d.

Compute:

437 + 468 = 905,

So, |D| + |G| + |S| = 905 + 3d.

But we also know that |D| + |G| + |S| = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.

So,

905 + 3d = 1124.

Subtract 905: 3d = 1124 - 905 = 219.

Divide by 3: d = 73.

Wait, that seems promising. So, d = 73.

So, the number of people owning all four things is 73.

But let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, the sum |D| + |G| + |S| = 195 + 367 + 562 = let's compute:

195 + 367 = 562,

562 + 562 = 1124. Correct.

Then, |D| + |G| + |S| = 437 (which is b) + 2*(234) (which is 2c) + 3d.

So, 437 + 468 = 905,

905 + 3d = 1124,

3d = 1124 - 905 = 219,

d = 219 / 3 = 73.

That seems correct.

Therefore, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the given data systematically.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( C \) be the set of residents who own candy hearts (universal set, \(|C| = 900\)).
   - Let \( D \), \( G \), and \( S \) be the sets of residents who own a diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade, respectively.
   - Given: \(|D| = 195\), \(|G| = 367\), \(|S| = 562\).
   - Let \( b = 437 \) be the number of residents who own exactly two of the four items.
   - Let \( c = 234 \) be the number of residents who own exactly three of the four items.
   - Let \( d \) be the number of residents who own all four items (to be determined).

2. **Total Residents:**
   The total number of residents is the sum of those owning exactly one, two, three, or four items:
   \[
   a + b + c + d = 900
   \]
   where \( a \) is the number of residents who own only candy hearts. Since \( a \) is not provided, we express \( a \) in terms of \( d \):
   \[
   a + d = 900 - b - c = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229
   \]

3. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**
   The sum of the sizes of \( D \), \( G \), and \( S \) is:
   \[
   |D| + |G| + |S| = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124
   \]
   Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we relate this to the number of residents owning exactly two and three items:
   \[
   |D| + |G| + |S| = b + 2c + 3d
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   1124 = 437 + 2(234) + 3d
   \]
   \[
   1124 = 437 + 468 + 3d
   \]
   \[
   1124 = 905 + 3d
   \]
   \[
   3d = 1124 - 905 = 219
   \]
   \[
   d = \frac{219}{3} = 73
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   The number of residents who own all four items is \( d = 73 \).

\boxed{73}
