Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, let me recall what the circumradius and inradius mean. The circumradius is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius is the radius of the inscribed circle. So, in triangle ABC, O is the center of the circumscribed circle, and I is the center of the inscribed circle.

The condition given is that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from I to A is perpendicular to the line from O to I. That seems important. Maybe I can use some properties related to the incenter and circumcenter.

Let me think about the positions of O and I in a triangle. In general, the incenter is always inside the triangle, while the circumcenter can be inside, on, or outside the triangle depending on whether the triangle is acute, right, or obtuse. Since the circumradius is 13, which is a positive value, and the inradius is 6, these are both positive, so the triangle is likely acute because both centers are inside.

Wait, but I can't be sure about the type of triangle. Maybe I should consider the formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. I remember there's a formula: OI² = R(R - 2r), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me check if that's correct.

Yes, that's a well-known formula. So, substituting the given values, OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 -12) = 13*1 =13. So, OI is sqrt(13). But wait, that might come into play later.

Now, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle IAO is a right-angled triangle at A. Wait, no, IA is perpendicular to OI, so the right angle is at I? Hmm, wait, IA is a segment from I to A, and OI is a segment from O to I. So, if IA is perpendicular to OI, that means the lines IA and OI are perpendicular at point I. So, the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. So, the triangle formed by points I, A, and O has a right angle at I. So, triangle IAO is right-angled at I.

Wait, no, because IA is from I to A, and OI is from O to I. So, if they are perpendicular, the right angle is at I. So, triangle IOA is right-angled at I. So, the sides would be IO, IA, and OA.

So, in triangle IOA, right-angled at I, by Pythagoras, we have:

IA² + IO² = OA².

But OA is the radius of the circumcircle, which is 13. So, OA = 13. IO is sqrt(13), as we calculated earlier. IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. Hmm, I need to find IA.

Wait, IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. I know that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the inradius and angles. Let me recall the formula.

I think the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = r / sin(A/2), where r is the inradius. Let me confirm that. Alternatively, another formula might be IA = 2R sin(A/2), but wait, that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of coordinates or vectors. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe I can express IA² in terms of other triangle parameters.

Wait, in triangle IOA, right-angled at I, we have IA² + IO² = OA². So, IA² = OA² - IO² = 13² - (sqrt(13))² = 169 -13= 156. So, IA²=156, which means IA= sqrt(156)=2*sqrt(39). Hmm, okay.

So, IA=2*sqrt(39). But I thought earlier IA might be expressed as r / sin(A/2). Let me see, since r is 6, so 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39). Then, sin(A/2)=6/(2*sqrt(39))=3/sqrt(39)=sqrt(39)/13.

Wait, because sqrt(39)=sqrt(13*3)=sqrt(13)*sqrt(3). So, sin(A/2)= 3/sqrt(39)= (3*sqrt(39))/39= sqrt(39)/13. So, sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13.

Hmm, I can write that down. Let me denote angle at A as angle A. So, sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13.

Wait, wait, let's compute sin(A/2):

From IA = r / sin(A/2), we have IA=2*sqrt(39).

Wait, if IA=2*sqrt(39), and r=6, then 2*sqrt(39)=6 / sin(A/2). So, sin(A/2)=6/(2*sqrt(39))=3/sqrt(39)=sqrt(39)/13. Because rationalizing the denominator, 3/sqrt(39)= (3*sqrt(39))/39= sqrt(39)/13.

So, sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13. Therefore, angle A/2 is arcsin(sqrt(39)/13). Hmm, maybe I can find cos(A/2) as well because that might be useful.

Since sin²x + cos²x=1, so cos²(A/2)=1 - (39/169)= (169-39)/169=130/169=10/13. So, cos(A/2)=sqrt(10/13)=sqrt(130)/13.

So, cos(A/2)=sqrt(130)/13.

Now, maybe I can find angle A. Because if I can find angle A, perhaps I can relate sides AB and AC through the Law of Cosines or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the sides in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter, or other triangle properties.

Wait, I also know that in a triangle, the inradius r= area / semiperimeter. So, r=6= area / s, where s is the semiperimeter.

The area can also be expressed using the formula area = (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides and R is the circumradius. So, area = (a*b*c)/(4*13)= (a*b*c)/52.

So, from r=6, area=6*s, where s=(a+b+c)/2.

So, setting these equal: 6*s = (a*b*c)/52.

So, 6*(a+b+c)/2 = (a*b*c)/52.

Simplify: 3*(a+b+c) = (a*b*c)/52.

So, a*b*c= 3*52*(a+b+c)=156*(a+b+c).

Hmm, that's one equation relating the sides.

But we need more information. Maybe I can find expressions involving angle A.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the distance from the inradius to vertex A. Wait, IA=2*sqrt(39). I remember that IA= (r)/sin(A/2). Wait, but earlier we had IA=2*sqrt(39)=6/sin(A/2), which led us to sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use other relations. For example, in triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can also be expressed using other trigonometric identities.

Wait, another formula I found is IA= (2R sin(theta)), where theta is something. Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe I can relate the sides using the Law of Sines. Since the circumradius is 13, the sides can be expressed as a=2R sin A, b=2R sin B, c=2R sin C. So, a=26 sin A, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.

Wait, let me confirm. The Law of Sines states that a/sin A = 2R, so a=2R sin A. Since R=13, a=26 sin A, etc.

So, sides AB and AC are c and b, respectively. Wait, actually, let me clarify. In triangle ABC, side opposite to A is BC, which is a. So, AB is side c, and AC is side b.

Wait, standard notation is: side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, side c opposite angle C. So, AB is side c (opposite angle C), and AC is side b (opposite angle B). So, AB= c, AC= b. So, the product AB*AC= b*c.

So, we need to find b*c.

Given that, perhaps I can find expressions for sin B and sin C, and then use angle sum identities.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the semiperimeter, area, and other relations.

Wait, let me think about the formula for the inradius: r = (area)/(semiperimeter). So, area= r*s=6*s.

Also, area can be expressed as (1/2)*ab*sin C, but maybe that's more complicated.

Wait, another formula expresses the area in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter: area= r*s=6*s.

Alternatively, area can be expressed as (a*b*c)/(4R)= (a*b*c)/52.

So, 6*s= (a*b*c)/52.

Which gives a*b*c=312*s.

But I don't know s yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can express s in terms of the sides. s=(a+b+c)/2.

So, a*b*c=312*(a+b+c)/2=156*(a+b+c).

Hmm, I have that a=26 sin A, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.

So, let me express everything in terms of angles.

So, a=26 sin A, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.

Then, s=(a+b+c)/2=13 (sin A + sin B + sin C).

So, s=13 (sin A + sin B + sin C).

So, area=6*s=78 (sin A + sin B + sin C).

Also, area= (a*b*c)/52= (26 sin A * 26 sin B *26 sin C)/52.

Simplify: (26^3 sin A sin B sin C)/52= (26^3)/(52) sin A sin B sin C= (26^2)/2 sin A sin B sin C.

26 squared is 676, divided by 2 is 338.

So, area=338 sin A sin B sin C.

Setting equal to area=78 (sin A + sin B + sin C):

338 sin A sin B sin C = 78 (sin A + sin B + sin C).

Hmm, that's a complicated equation. Maybe I can find a way to relate angle A to the other angles.

Since in triangle ABC, A+B+C=180 degrees, so C=180 - A - B. So, perhaps I can express everything in terms of angles A and B.

But that might get too involved. Alternatively, maybe I can find expressions using the sine of half-angles, since I have some information about sin(A/2).

Earlier, I found that sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13.

So, angle A/2= arcsin(sqrt(39)/13). Let me see if I can find cos(A) using this.

Using the double-angle formula: cos A=1 - 2 sin²(A/2)=1 - 2*(39/169)=1 - 78/169= (169-78)/169=91/169=13/23? Wait, no. 91 is 13*7, and 169 is 13². So, 91/169=7/13. So, cos A=7/13.

Therefore, angle A has a cosine of 7/13. So, cos A=7/13.

So, angle A is arccos(7/13). So, sin A can be found using sin²A + cos²A=1. So, sin A= sqrt(1 - (49/169))=sqrt(120/169)=sqrt(120)/13= (2*sqrt(30))/13.

So, sin A=2*sqrt(30)/13.

So, side a=26 sin A=26*(2*sqrt(30)/13)=4*sqrt(30).

So, side a=BC=4*sqrt(30). Okay, that's a.

Now, I need to find sides b and c, which are AC and AB, respectively.

So, AB= c=26 sin C, AC= b=26 sin B.

So, we need to find b*c= (26 sin B)*(26 sin C)=676 sin B sin C.

So, if I can find sin B sin C, that would give me the product.

Alternatively, maybe I can find expressions involving angles B and C.

I know that in triangle ABC, A+B+C=π. So, B+C=π - A.

So, sin(B+C)=sin(π - A)=sin A=2*sqrt(30)/13.

Also, sin(B+C)=sin B cos C + cos B sin C.

Hmm, maybe that's useful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for IA in terms of sides.

Wait, I found IA=2*sqrt(39), and IA is also expressible in another way. Let me think.

Wait, in triangle ABC, the distance from the inradius to vertex A is given by IA= (r)/sin(A/2). Wait, earlier I thought that was the case, but let me verify.

Wait, I found that IA=2*sqrt(39)=6/sin(A/2), which led to sin(A/2)= sqrt(39)/13. So, that seems correct.

So, perhaps I can find the length of IA in another way to get another equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use coordinate geometry. Let me try that approach.

Let me place the triangle in a coordinate system. Let's place the circumcenter O at the origin (0,0). Since OA=13, the circumradius is 13.

Now, the incenter I is located somewhere inside the triangle. The condition is that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from I to A is perpendicular to the line from O to I.

Let me denote the coordinates of I as (h, k). Then, the coordinates of A can be expressed in terms of h and k, because IA is perpendicular to OI.

Wait, perhaps it's better to place point A somewhere on the circumcircle. Let's place point A at (13,0), so that OA is along the x-axis. Then, the circumradius is 13, so point A is at (13,0).

Wait, but then O is at (0,0), and point I is at some (h,k). The line IA goes from (h,k) to (13,0), and OI is the line from (0,0) to (h,k). These two lines should be perpendicular.

So, the vectors IA and OI should be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero.

Vector IA is (13 - h, 0 - k).

Vector OI is (h, k).

So, their dot product is (13 - h)*h + (0 - k)*k = 0.

So, (13 - h)*h + (-k)*k=0.

Which simplifies to 13h - h² -k²=0.

So, 13h = h² +k².

That's equation one.

Now, since I is the incenter, its coordinates can also be expressed in terms of the sides of the triangle.

The formula for the incenter in a triangle with vertices at (x_A, y_A), (x_B, y_B), (x_C, y_C) and sides opposite to these vertices as a, b, c is:

I = ( (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C)/ (a + b + c), (a y_A + b y_B + c y_C)/ (a + b + c) )

But in my coordinate system, point A is at (13,0), and points B and C are somewhere on the circumcircle. Wait, but without knowing where B and C are, this might get complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the inradius is 6. The distance from the incenter I to each side is 6. So, for example, the distance from I to side BC is 6.

But without knowing the coordinates of B and C, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use another property. The inradius r=6 is related to the area and semiperimeter.

So, area= r*s=6*s.

The area can also be calculated using coordinates. But since I only have point A at (13,0), it's hard to compute the area without knowing other points.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find another equation involving h and k.

Since I is the incenter, it lies at the intersection of the angle bisectors. But I'm not sure how to use that here.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the coordinates of the incenter in terms of the sides.

Wait, if I denote the sides opposite to A, B, C as a, b, c, respectively, then the incenter's coordinates are given by ( (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C)/(a + b + c), (a y_A + b y_B + c y_C)/(a + b + c) ). But in my coordinate system, A is at (13,0), and points B and C are unknown.

Hmm, maybe this approach is getting too involved. Let me think of another way.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the distance from the incenter to the vertex A, which we already found as IA=2*sqrt(39). So, IA is the distance from I to A, which is sqrt( (13 - h)^2 + (0 - k)^2 )=sqrt( (13 - h)^2 + k^2 )=2*sqrt(39).

So, square both sides: (13 - h)^2 + k^2 =4*39=156.

Expanding: 169 -26h + h² +k²=156.

Rearranging: h² +k² -26h +169 -156=0 => h² +k² -26h +13=0.

But from earlier, we have equation 13h = h² +k².

So, substitute h² +k²=13h into the above equation.

So, 13h -26h +13=0 => -13h +13=0 => -13h= -13 => h=1.

So, h=1. Then, from equation 13h= h² +k², 13*1=1² +k² =>13=1 +k² =>k²=12 =>k=±2*sqrt(3).

So, the incenter I is at (1, 2√3) or (1, -2√3). But since the triangle is above the x-axis (assuming A is at (13,0)), the incenter is likely above the x-axis, so k=2√3.

So, I=(1, 2√3).

Now, the inradius is 6, so the distance from I to each side is 6. Let me confirm that.

Wait, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side. For example, the distance from (1, 2√3) to side BC should be 6.

But without knowing the equation of side BC, it's hard to compute that. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter.

Wait, since I know the coordinates of point A and the inradius, but not the other points, perhaps I can find the area in another way.

Wait, another thought: The distance from I to O is sqrt(13), as we found earlier. So, the distance between (0,0) and (1, 2√3) is sqrt(1² + (2√3)^2)=sqrt(1 +12)=sqrt(13). So, that checks out. Good.

So, back to the problem. Now, I have point A at (13,0), incenter I at (1, 2√3), and circumradius 13. I need to find sides AB and AC, then compute their product.

Wait, maybe I can find the coordinates of points B and C. Since all points lie on the circumcircle centered at O (0,0) with radius 13. So, points B and C are somewhere on x² + y² =13²=169.

Also, the incenter is at (1, 2√3), so the inradius is 6. So, the distance from I to each side is 6.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the equations of the angle bisectors. But that might get complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can find the lengths of sides AB and AC using the coordinates of A and the inradius.

Wait, another formula: In a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is IA= (r)/sin(A/2). Wait, earlier I used that and found sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13.

Which led to cos A=7/13, which we used to find side a=4√30.

Wait, but perhaps I can use the formula for the area in two different ways.

Earlier, we had area=6*s=78*(sin A + sin B + sin C).

And also area= (a*b*c)/(4R)= (a*b*c)/52.

And we have a=4√30.

So, let me write down:

area= (4√30 * b * c)/52= (4√30 bc)/52= (√30 bc)/13.

So, area= √30 bc /13.

But area is also 6*s=6*(a + b + c)/2=3*(a + b + c).

So, 3*(a + b + c)=√30 bc /13.

So, 3*(4√30 + b + c)=√30 bc /13.

Hmm, that's one equation.

But I have another relation from the Law of Sines: a=26 sin A, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.

And angle A is known, since cos A=7/13, so sin A=2√30/13.

So, a=4√30=26*(2√30)/13=4√30, which checks out.

So, sides b=26 sin B and c=26 sin C.

Also, since in triangle ABC, A + B + C= π, so B + C= π - A.

So, sin(B + C)=sin(π - A)=sin A=2√30/13.

Also, using the formula for sin(B + C)=sin B cos C + cos B sin C.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express sin B and sin C in terms of angle A.

Wait, another idea: Since I have the inradius and the coordinates of I, maybe I can find the equations of the sides and use the distance formula.

Wait, the inradius is the distance from I to each side. So, the distance from point I(1, 2√3) to side BC is 6.

But without knowing the equation of BC, it's hard to compute. Alternatively, maybe I can find the equation of side BC.

Wait, but I know that points B and C lie on the circumcircle x² + y² =169.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can find another approach.

Wait, earlier, we had a*b*c=312*s, where s=(a + b + c)/2.

So, a*b*c= 312*(a + b + c)/2=156*(a + b + c).

But a=4√30.

So, 4√30 * b * c=156*(4√30 + b + c).

Divide both sides by 4√30:

b * c= [156*(4√30 + b + c)]/(4√30)= [156/(4√30)]*(4√30 + b + c).

Simplify 156/(4√30)= (39)/(√30)= (39√30)/30=13√30/10.

So, b*c= (13√30/10)*(4√30 + b + c).

Expanding the right-hand side:

b*c= (13√30/10)*(4√30) + (13√30/10)*b + (13√30/10)*c.

Compute each term:

First term: (13√30 *4√30)/10= (13*4*30)/10= (52*30)/10=52*3=156.

Second term: (13√30 /10)*b.

Third term: (13√30 /10)*c.

So, putting it together:

b*c=156 + (13√30 /10)*b + (13√30 /10)*c.

Rearranging:

b*c - (13√30 /10)*b - (13√30 /10)*c =156.

Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of b and c. Maybe I can factor this.

Let me factor:

b*c - (13√30 /10)*b - (13√30 /10)*c =156.

Let me add (13√30 /10)^2 to both sides to complete the square.

But that might not be the best approach. Alternatively, maybe I can factor as (b - 13√30 /10)(c -13√30 /10)=156 + (13√30 /10)^2.

Wait, let me try that.

We have:

b*c - (13√30 /10)*b - (13√30 /10)*c =156.

Adding (13√30 /10)^2 to both sides:

b*c - (13√30 /10)*b - (13√30 /10)*c + (13√30 /10)^2=156 + (13√30 /10)^2.

Left side becomes (b -13√30 /10)(c -13√30 /10).

Right side: compute (13√30 /10)^2= (169*30)/100=5070/100=50.7. So, 156 +50.7=206.7. But 206.7 is 2067/10, but that's messy. Maybe it's better to keep it as fractions.

Wait, 13^2=169, √30 squared is 30, so (13√30)^2=169*30=5070.

So, (13√30 /10)^2=5070/100=507/10=50.7.

So, 156 +507/10= (156*10 +507)/10= (1560 +507)/10=2067/10=206.7.

So, (b -13√30 /10)(c -13√30 /10)=206.7=2067/10.

Hmm, that's (b -13√30 /10)(c -13√30 /10)=2067/10.

Not sure if that helps, but perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Law of Cosines on angle A. Since I know cos A=7/13, and sides b and c.

Law of Cosines: a²= b² + c² -2bc cos A.

So, (4√30)^2= b² +c² -2 bc*(7/13).

So, 16*30= b² +c² - (14 bc)/13.

480= b² +c² - (14 bc)/13.

Hmm, so equation 1: b² +c² - (14 bc)/13 =480.

Equation 2: from the earlier equation, b*c=156 + (13√30 /10)*b + (13√30 /10)*c.

Wait, that's getting complicated. Maybe I can use substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express b + c and bc in terms of variables.

Let me denote x= b + c, y= bc.

So, equation 1: b² +c² - (14 bc)/13=480.

But b² +c²= (b + c)^2 - 2 bc= x² - 2y.

So, equation 1 becomes x² -2y - (14 y)/13=480.

Multiply through by 13 to eliminate denominator:

13x² -26y -14y= 480*13.

So, 13x² -40y= 6240.

Equation 2: from earlier, y=156 + (13√30 /10)*b + (13√30 /10)*c.

But b + c= x, so:

y=156 + (13√30 /10)*x.

So, equation 2 is y=156 + (13√30 /10)x.

So, substitute y=156 + (13√30 /10)x into equation 1:

13x² -40*(156 + (13√30 /10)x )=6240.

Compute 40*156=6240.

So, 13x² -6240 -40*(13√30 /10)x =6240.

Simplify 40*(13√30 /10)=4*13√30=52√30.

So, the equation becomes:

13x² -6240 -52√30 x =6240.

Bring all terms to left side:

13x² -52√30 x -6240 -6240=0.

So, 13x² -52√30 x -12480=0.

Divide entire equation by 13:

x² -4√30 x - 960=0.

So, quadratic equation: x² -4√30 x -960=0.

Solve for x using quadratic formula:

x=[4√30 ± sqrt( (4√30)^2 +4*960 )]/2.

Compute discriminant:

(4√30)^2=16*30=480.

4*960=3840.

So, discriminant=480 +3840=4320.

So, sqrt(4320)=sqrt(16*270)=4*sqrt(270)=4*sqrt(9*30)=4*3*sqrt(30)=12√30.

So, x=[4√30 ±12√30]/2.

So, two solutions:

x=(4√30 +12√30)/2=16√30 /2=8√30,

or x=(4√30 -12√30)/2=(-8√30)/2= -4√30.

But since x= b +c is a length, it must be positive. So, x=8√30.

So, b +c=8√30.

Now, from equation 2: y=156 + (13√30 /10)*(8√30).

Compute (13√30 /10)*(8√30)=13*8*(√30)^2 /10=104*30 /10=104*3=312.

So, y=156 +312=468.

So, bc=468.

Therefore, the product AB*AC= bc=468.

Wait, but wait, AB is c, AC is b, so yes, bc is their product. So, 468 is the answer.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, in equation 1: 13x² -40y=6240.

From equation 2: y=156 + (13√30 /10)x.

Substitute into equation 1: 13x² -40*(156 + (13√30 /10)x )=6240.

Which becomes 13x² -6240 -52√30 x=6240.

Then, 13x² -52√30 x=12480.

Divide by 13: x² -4√30 x=960.

Wait, no: 12480/13=960.

So, x² -4√30 x=960.

Wait, earlier I think I missed a step. Wait, let me redo that part.

Wait, after bringing all terms to the left, I had:

13x² -52√30 x -12480=0.

Divided by 13: x² -4√30 x -960=0.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, discriminant= (4√30)^2 +4*1*960=480 +3840=4320.

sqrt(4320)=sqrt(16*270)=4*sqrt(270)=4*sqrt(9*30)=12*sqrt(30).

So, x=(4√30 ±12√30)/2.

So, x= (16√30)/2=8√30 or x=(-8√30)/2=-4√30. So, x=8√30.

Then, y=156 + (13√30 /10)*8√30.

Calculate 13√30 /10 *8√30=13*8*(30)/10=104*3=312.

So, y=156 +312=468.

So, bc=468.

Yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, the product AB*AC= b*c=468.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the circumradius \( R = 13 \) and the inradius \( r = 6 \). The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) implies that triangle \( IOA \) is right-angled at \( I \). Using the formula \( OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \), we find \( OI = \sqrt{13} \). By the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle IOA \), we have:

\[
IA^2 + OI^2 = OA^2 \implies IA^2 + 13 = 169 \implies IA^2 = 156 \implies IA = 2\sqrt{39}.
\]

The distance from the incenter to vertex \( A \) is given by \( IA = \frac{r}{\sin(A/2)} \). Substituting \( IA = 2\sqrt{39} \) and \( r = 6 \), we find:

\[
\sin(A/2) = \frac{6}{2\sqrt{39}} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}.
\]

Using the double-angle formula, we calculate \( \cos A = 1 - 2\sin^2(A/2) = \frac{7}{13} \). The side \( a = BC \) is found using the Law of Sines:

\[
a = 2R \sin A = 26 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} = 4\sqrt{30}.
\]

Next, we use the relationship between the area, semiperimeter, and inradius. The area \( \Delta \) can be expressed as \( \Delta = r \cdot s \) and \( \Delta = \frac{abc}{4R} \). Equating these, we find:

\[
6s = \frac{abc}{52} \implies abc = 312s.
\]

Using the Law of Cosines for angle \( A \):

\[
a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A \implies 480 = b^2 + c^2 - \frac{14bc}{13}.
\]

We also know \( bc = 468 \) from solving the quadratic equations derived from the given conditions. Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC = bc = 468 \).

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{468}
\]
