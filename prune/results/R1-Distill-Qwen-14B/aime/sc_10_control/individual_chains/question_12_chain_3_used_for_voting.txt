Okay, so I've got this problem here about filling a 2x3 grid with digits. The goal is to have the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right equal 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom equal 99. Hmm, let's try to make sense of this.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2-row by 3-column grid. Let me denote the cells as follows:

a | b | c
d | e | f

So, the top row is a, b, c and the bottom row is d, e, f.

When we read left to right, the two numbers formed would be the top row as a three-digit number, say ABC, and the bottom row as DEF. So, ABC + DEF = 999.

When we read top to bottom, the three numbers formed would be AD, BE, CF. So, AD + BE + CF = 99.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, when reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So, the first column is a and d, forming the number ad. The second column is b and e, forming be. The third column is c and f, forming cf. So, ad + be + cf = 99.

So, to recap:

1. The sum of the top row as a three-digit number (abc) and the bottom row as a three-digit number (def) is 999.

2. The sum of each column as a two-digit number (ad, be, cf) is 99.

Hmm, okay, so let's translate this into equations.

First, the sum of the two three-digit numbers:

abc + def = 999

But abc is 100a + 10b + c.

Similarly, def is 100d + 10e + f.

So, 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Simplify that:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

So, 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Now, the second condition is that the sum of each column as two-digit numbers equals 99.

So, ad + be + cf = 99.

Each column is a two-digit number:

ad = 10a + d.

be = 10b + e.

cf = 10c + f.

So, adding them up:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Simplify that:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

So, now we have two equations:

1. 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999

2. 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Let me denote some variables to simplify.

Let me let S1 = a + d, S2 = b + e, S3 = c + f.

So equation 1 becomes:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Equation 2: Let me express it in terms of S1, S2, S3.

Wait, equation 2 is:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

But notice that a + d = S1, so d = S1 - a.

Similarly, e = S2 - b, and f = S3 - c.

So, d + e + f = (S1 - a) + (S2 - b) + (S3 - c) = S1 + S2 + S3 - (a + b + c).

So, equation 2 becomes:

10(a + b + c) + (S1 + S2 + S3 - (a + b + c)) = 99.

Simplify that:

10(a + b + c) + S1 + S2 + S3 - (a + b + c) = 99.

Which is:

9(a + b + c) + S1 + S2 + S3 = 99.

Hmm, okay. Let me denote T = a + b + c.

So, equation 2 becomes:

9T + S1 + S2 + S3 = 99.

But from equation 1, 100S1 + 10S2 + S3 = 999.

So, now we have two equations:

1. 100S1 + 10S2 + S3 = 999.

2. 9T + S1 + S2 + S3 = 99.

But T is a + b + c. Hmm.

I wonder if there's a way to relate T with S1, S2, S3.

Wait, S1 = a + d, so d = S1 - a.

Similarly, e = S2 - b, f = S3 - c.

So, the variables d, e, f are determined once a, b, c are chosen, given S1, S2, S3.

But perhaps we can express T in terms of S1, S2, S3.

Wait, T = a + b + c.

But S1 = a + d, so d = S1 - a.

Similarly, S2 = b + e, so e = S2 - b.

S3 = c + f, so f = S3 - c.

So, let me see, from equation 1: 100S1 + 10S2 + S3 = 999.

We can think of this as the digits of a three-digit number: S1 is the hundreds digit, S2 the tens, S3 the ones. So, this would be 999.

Wait, 100S1 +10S2 + S3 is 999.

So, 100S1 +10S2 + S3 = 999.

Which implies that S1, S2, S3 must form the digits of 999.

Wait, but S1, S2, S3 are sums of digits, so each must be between 0 and 18 (since each is a sum of two digits, each digit being 0-9). But 999 is a three-digit number where each digit is 9.

So, S1 = 9, S2=9, S3=9.

Wait, is that possible? Because 100*9 +10*9 +9=900+90+9=999. Yes.

So, from equation 1, S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

So, knowing that S1=9, S2=9, S3=9, let's plug into equation 2.

Equation 2: 9T + S1 + S2 + S3 =99.

We know S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

So, 9T + 9 +9 +9=99.

So, 9T +27=99.

Subtract 27: 9T=72 → T=8.

So, T=8.

So, T is a + b + c =8.

So, our constraints are:

a + d =9

b + e=9

c + f=9

and a + b + c=8.

So, now, each of a, b, c is a digit (0-9), and d, e, f are digits as well.

We need to find the number of possible grids.

So, let's see.

Given that a + d=9, so d=9 -a.

Similarly, e=9 - b, f=9 -c.

Since d, e, f must be digits (0-9), then a, b, c must be such that 9 -a, 9 -b, 9 -c are digits, which they always are because a, b, c are 0-9.

But more importantly, the digits a, b, c must satisfy a + b + c=8.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of possible triplets (a, b, c) where each is between 0 and 9, inclusive, and their sum is 8.

Each such triplet determines d, e, f as 9 -a, 9 -b, 9 -c, respectively.

So, the number of such grids is equal to the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, where 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤9.

But since 8 is less than 9, all solutions automatically satisfy a, b, c ≤9.

So, the number of solutions is C(8 +3 -1, 3 -1) = C(10,2) = 45.

Wait, but wait, that's the case if a, b, c are non-negative integers. Yes, because digits can be 0.

But wait, wait a second. Are a, b, c allowed to be zero?

Looking back at the example, the top row starts with 0, so yes, leading zeros are allowed. So digits can be zero.

So, the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8 is indeed C(8 +3 -1, 3-1)=C(10,2)=45.

So, 45 possible triplets (a, b, c).

But wait, we need to make sure that when we compute d, e, f as 9 -a, 9 -b, 9 -c, those are also digits (0-9). Since a, b, c are between 0 and 9, 9 -a, etc., will also be between 0 and 9. So, no problem there.

Therefore, each of the 45 triplets (a, b, c) will correspond to a valid grid where d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c.

So, do we have 45 possible grids? Hmm, but wait, are there any constraints I'm missing?

Wait, let's think about the example given.

The example is:

0 0 8

9 9 1

Here, a=0, b=0, c=8. So, a + b + c=8. Then d=9-0=9, e=9-0=9, f=9-8=1.

Indeed, ad + be + cf = (09)+(09)+(81)=9+9+81=99, which is correct.

So, this is one of the 45 triplets.

But wait, another thing to check: in the grid, are the numbers formed by left-to-right and top-to-bottom as required.

Wait, in the left-to-right sum, the top row is a three-digit number, so a can be zero. Similarly for the column sums, a can be zero, so the two-digit number ad can start with zero, making it a single-digit number? Wait, but in the example, the first column is 0 and 9, forming 09, which is 9, but in the grid, it's written as 0 | 9, so is that allowed?

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom." So, each column is a two-digit number, regardless of leading zeros. So, 09 is 9, 09 is 9, and 81 is 81, summing to 99. So, it's allowed for the two-digit numbers to have leading zeros, effectively making them single-digit numbers.

But the left-to-right numbers: the top row is a three-digit number, which could have leading zeros, so 008 is 8, but in the problem, it's treated as 8. Wait, in the example, it says 8 + 991 = 999. So, 008 is 8, and 991 is 991, adding to 999. So, yeah, leading zeros are allowed in the row numbers as well.

So, all digits can be zero, and leading zeros are acceptable.

Therefore, each solution (a, b, c) where a + b + c=8, with a, b, c digits (0-9), is acceptable, leading to 45 possibilities.

But wait, hold on. I just thought of something else. Each grid is determined by (a, b, c), but we need to make sure that d, e, f are digits as well.

But since a, b, c are between 0 and 9, d=9 -a, etc., would be between 0 and 9 as well. So, no problem there.

So, the number of grids is 45? But wait, let me think again.

Wait, the problem is about a 2x3 grid, so each cell is a digit. So, for each possible (a, b, c), we have a unique (d, e, f). So, the number of grids is 45.

But wait, I feel like this is too straightforward. Let me check if I've missed any constraints.

Wait, the first equation was 100S1 +10S2 +S3=999, which forced S1=S2=S3=9.

So, S1= a + d=9, S2= b + e=9, S3= c + f=9.

So, each pair adds to 9.

And from equation 2, we had 9T + 27=99, so T=8, where T= a + b + c=8.

So, yes, these are the constraints.

So, each a, b, c is a digit between 0 and 9, sum to 8, determining d, e, f as 9 - a, etc.

So, the number of triplets is C(10,2)=45.

Wait, but another way to compute that is stars and bars. The number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8 is (8 +3-1 choose 3-1)= (10 choose 2)=45. So, yes, 45.

So, that's the number of possible grids.

Wait, but in the example, the top row is 0,0,8. So, a=0, b=0, c=8. So, that's one solution.

Another example: a=1, b=2, c=5. Then d=8, e=7, f=4. So, the grid would be:

1 | 2 |5

8 |7 |4

The top row is 125, the bottom row is 874. 125 + 874= 1000-1=999? Wait, 125 + 874= 1000-1? Wait, 125+874= 999, yes.

And for the columns: 18, 27, 54. Adding 18 +27=45, 45 +54=99, which is correct.

So, that's another valid grid.

So, in that case, the grid is valid.

But wait, another point: the columns are read top to bottom, right? So, the first column is a and d, so the number is 10a + d. So, for a=1, d=8, that's 18.

But what if a=9 and d=0? Then, the column number would be 90.

Wait, for example, a=9, d=0: column is 90.

Similarly, if a=8, d=1: 81.

So, columns can have two-digit numbers from 00 to 99. Wait, but if all a, b, c are 9, then d, e, f would be 0, but a + b + c=27, which is more than 8, so that's not our case here.

In our problem, a + b + c=8, so a, b, c can be 0-8, but since they sum to 8, each can be at most 8.

So, the maximum a can be is 8, with b=0, c=0.

But in that case, d=1, e=9, f=9.

So, columns would be 81, 09, 09.

Wait, 81 is 81, 09 is 9, 09 is 9. So, 81+9+9=99, which is correct.

So, that's another valid grid.

Wait, but in that case, the top row is 800, which is 800, and the bottom row is 199, which is 199.

800 +199=999, which is correct.

So, all these seem valid.

So, I think the answer is 45.

But wait, the example has a=0, b=0, c=8. So, the number of grids is 45.

But wait a moment, does each triplet (a, b, c) correspond to a unique grid, considering that d, e, f are determined?

Yes. Because each a, b, c defines d, e, f uniquely.

So, the number is 45.

Wait, but let me think again. Are all these 45 grids unique, or are there any overcounts?

Wait, for example, is there a case where two different triplets (a, b, c) give the same grid?

No, because each triplet defines a unique grid. So, each triplet corresponds to exactly one grid, and vice versa.

So, the number of grids is 45.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says "the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999." So, the top row is a three-digit number, which could have leading zeros, but it's treated as a three-digit number.

So, if the top row is, say, 008, that's 8, and the bottom row is 991, which is 991. So, 8 +991=999.

But in another grid, if the top row is 080, which is 80, and the bottom row is 919, which is 919. 80 +919=999? 80+919=999, yes.

Wait, but 080 is 80, but in the grid, it's written as 0,8,0. So, the top row is 080 which is 80. But in the problem statement, the example treats the top row as 008, which is 8, and the bottom row as 991, which is 991.

So, the sum is 8 +991=999.

So, the way the numbers are formed is as three-digit numbers, with leading zeros allowed.

So, for example, top row is 008, which is 8, and bottom row is 991, which is 991. So, 8 +991=999.

But another grid with top row 080 is 80, and bottom row 919 is 919; 80+919=999.

So, both are valid. So, all triplets (a, b, c) that sum to 8, leading to top rows from 008 to 800, are allowed.

So, if I'm considering all possible (a, b, c) where a + b + c=8, then the count is 45.

But wait, let me compute that again.

The number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8 is C(8 +3 -1, 3 -1)=C(10,2)=45. So, yes, 45.

So, the answer is 45.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the example has a=0, b=0, c=8, which is one of those 45.

But perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, the problem is about a 2x3 grid, so each cell is a digit. So, each of the 6 cells must be filled with a digit. But in our approach, we're only determining a, b, c, d, e, f, each of which is a digit.

So, each grid is a 2x3 grid with digits a, b, c, d, e, f, with a + b + c=8, a + d=9, etc.

So, 45 grids.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the numbers formed by the rows and columns as numbers without leading zeros. But the example shows that leading zeros are allowed because the top row is 008, which is 8, and the bottom row is 991, which is 991.

So, the problem seems to allow leading zeros in the numbers formed by the rows and columns.

Therefore, the number of grids is 45.

But wait, another thought: in the top row, the number is abc, which is 100a +10b +c. Similarly, the bottom row is def=100d +10e +f.

So, the sum is 100(a + d) +10(b + e) + (c + f)=999.

But we found that S1=9, S2=9, S3=9, so each digit pair adds to 9.

So, a + d=9, b + e=9, c + f=9.

But from the top row, abc, and bottom row def, each is a 3-digit number, but if a is zero, it's a smaller number.

But since the problem allows that, as per the example, then all solutions are acceptable.

So, yes, 45 is the correct number.

Wait, but the problem says "the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99." So, each column is a two-digit number, which can have leading zeros. So, for example, the first column is ad, which is 10a + d.

In the example, a=0, d=9, so 09=9.

So, that's allowed.

So, yes, the columns can be single-digit numbers if a=0, b=0, etc.

So, all 45 grids are acceptable.

Therefore, the answer is 45.

But wait, another point: the two-digit numbers formed by the columns. If a=0, then the first column is 0d, which is d, but in the grid, is it written as 0 and d, forming 0d, which is 10a + d=0*10 +d=d.

So, that's correct.

Thus, I think the answer is 45.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says "the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999".

If the top row is 008, that's 8, and the bottom row is 991, that's 991. 8 +991=999.

But what if the top row were 000? Then the bottom row would have to be 999. But 000 +999=999, which is correct.

But wait, in that case, a + b + c=0, which would mean S1= a + d=9, so d=9, e=9, f=9.

So, the grid would be:

0 |0 |0

9 |9 |9

Top row: 000=0, bottom row: 999=999, sum=999.

Columns: 09, 09, 09. 9 +9 +9=27, which is not 99. So, that's not acceptable.

So, in that case, the columns sum to 27, which is less than 99. So, that grid is invalid, even though the row sums are correct.

Wait, but in our constraints, T = a + b + c=8.

So, a + b + c=8, which makes the column sum 99.

So, in the case where a + b + c=0, that's not allowed because T would have to be 8.

So, in our constraints, T=8, which makes the column sum 99.

So, in the case where a + b + c=0, that's not considered because T=8.

So, all 45 grids satisfy both the row and column conditions.

So, the answer is 45.

Wait, but to make sure, let me think of another example.

Suppose a=1, b=1, c=6.

Then, d=8, e=8, f=3.

Grid:

1 |1 |6

8 |8 |3

Top row: 116, bottom row: 883.

116 +883=1000-1=999? 116+883=999, yes.

Columns: 18, 18, 63.

18 +18=36, +63=99. Correct.

So, that's another valid grid.

Another example: a=2, b=3, c=3.

d=7, e=6, f=6.

Top row: 233, bottom: 766.

233 +766=999.

Columns: 27, 36, 36.

27+36=63, +36=99.

Yes, correct.

So, all these examples fit.

Thus, I think the answer is 45.

**Final Answer**
The number of ways is \boxed{45}.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we need to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99.

We denote the cells of the grid as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

1. The sum of the two three-digit numbers formed by the rows must be 999:
   \[
   (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
   \]

2. The sum of the three two-digit numbers formed by the columns must be 99:
   \[
   (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
   \]

We introduce the variables \( S1 = a + d \), \( S2 = b + e \), \( S3 = c + f \). From the first equation, we have:
   \[
   100S1 + 10S2 + S3 = 999
   \]
   This implies \( S1 = 9 \), \( S2 = 9 \), \( S3 = 9 \).

From the second equation, we know:
   \[
   10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
   \]
   Substituting \( d = 9 - a \), \( e = 9 - b \), \( f = 9 - c \), we get:
   \[
   9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   9T = 72 \implies T = 8
   \]
   where \( T = a + b + c \).

Thus, we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( a + b + c = 8 \) where \( a, b, c \) are digits (0-9). This is a classic "stars and bars" problem, which gives us:
   \[
   \binom{8 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{10}{2} = 45
   \]

Therefore, the number of ways to fill the grid is \(\boxed{45}\).
