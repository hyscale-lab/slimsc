Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but a certain distance away from the center of that circle. In this case, the radius of the circle being revolved is 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of revolution is 6. So, the torus T is formed by rotating this circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away.

Then there's this sphere S with a radius of 11. The problem says when the torus rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. I remember that for a torus, there are two important radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. So in this case, R is 6 and r is 3.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle. I need to find the radii of these circles of tangency.

Wait, but the sphere has a fixed radius of 11. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus must be such that the surfaces are tangent. Similarly for the external case.

Let me think in terms of coordinates. Maybe I can model the sphere and the torus in a coordinate system. Let's set the center of the sphere S at the origin (0,0,0). Then, when the torus T is inside S, the center of the torus must be at some point along, say, the z-axis. Similarly, when it's outside, the center might be on the other side.

Wait, but the torus is symmetric around its own axis, which is the same as the sphere's center when it's resting on the inside or outside, right? So when T is inside S, the center of the generating circle is at a distance that allows the torus to touch the sphere. Similarly for the external case.

I think I need to find the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the generating circle of the torus in both cases (internal and external tangency), and then from that, figure out the radii of the circles along which they are tangent.

Let me clarify: when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the closest point on the torus to the center of the sphere would be along the line connecting the centers. Similarly, the furthest point would also be along that line. So the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center would be such that the minimal distance from sphere's center to torus's surface is equal to the sphere's radius minus the minimal distance from the torus's surface, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should model the torus mathematically. The equation of a torus with major radius R and minor radius r is given by:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r²

In this case, R is 6, and r is 3, so the equation becomes:

(√(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 9

And the sphere S has the equation x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the surfaces touch at exactly one point (or along a circle, in this case). Wait, no, actually, when two surfaces are tangent along a circle, it's more complicated. Maybe I should think of this as the torus being inside the sphere and touching it along a circle, which would mean that the sphere and torus share that circle as a curve of intersection.

So, to find the circle of tangency, perhaps the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center (which is at (0,0,0) for the sphere, but where is the torus's center?) Wait, the torus is generated by revolving a circle around an axis. So the center of the generating circle is at a point (R, 0, 0) when the axis is along the z-axis, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should set up the coordinate system such that the axis of the torus is the z-axis. So the torus is centered at the origin, right? Because when you revolve a circle around an axis in its plane, the center of the circle moves along the axis. So in this case, the generating circle has radius 3, and the axis is at a distance 6 from the center of the generating circle, so the major radius R is 6. So the torus is centered at the origin, and its equation is (√(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 3² = 9.

So the torus is centered at (0,0,0), same as the sphere. So when the torus is resting inside the sphere, it's touching the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when it's resting outside, the torus is externally tangent to the sphere. Since both are centered at the origin, this must mean that the sphere and the torus touch along a circle in a plane equidistant from the origin.

Wait, but how does that work? Because the torus is symmetric around its own axis, which is the z-axis. So any cross-section in the x-y plane would show the generating circle.

Wait, maybe I should think about the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface along the line connecting the centers. But wait, both centers are at (0,0,0), so the distance is zero. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps when the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center is at a distance equal to the sphere's radius minus the torus's "inner" radius. Similarly, when it's resting on the outside, the farthest point on the torus is equal to the sphere's radius plus the torus's "outer" radius.

Wait, the torus has two radii: R = 6 (major) and r = 3 (minor). So the distance from the center of the torus to the inner edge is R - r = 6 - 3 = 3, and to the outer edge is R + r = 9.

But the sphere has a radius of 11. So if the torus is inside the sphere, the farthest point on the torus from the center is 9, which is less than 11, so that would make sense. But when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the closest point on the torus would be 3, but the sphere's radius is 11, so how does that work?

Wait, maybe I need to consider the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface along the line of tangency. So for internal tangency, the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center is such that the sphere's radius minus the distance equals the torus's outer radius. Similarly, for external tangency, the sphere's radius plus the distance equals the torus's inner radius.

Wait, no, I think it's the opposite. When the torus is inside the sphere, the maximum distance from the center to the torus's surface is equal to the sphere's radius. So for the torus, the maximum distance is R + r = 6 + 3 = 9. But the sphere's radius is 11. So 9 < 11, so the torus can fit inside. But how does the tangency work?

Wait, maybe the sphere and torus are tangent along a circle. So the points of tangency lie on a circle that's in a plane at some distance from the center.

Let me try to model this. Let's say the sphere is centered at (0,0,0), and the torus is also centered at (0,0,0). The sphere has radius 11, and the torus is defined by (√(x² + y²) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.

To find where they are tangent, we can set their normals equal at the point of tangency. So, the gradients of the sphere and torus must be parallel at the point of tangency.

The sphere's gradient is straightforward: (2x, 2y, 2z).

For the torus, let's compute the gradient. Let’s denote F(x,y,z) = (√(x² + y²) - 6)^2 + z² - 9. So the gradient ∇F is:

∇F = [ (2(√(x² + y²) - 6) * (x / √(x² + y²)) ), (2(√(x² + y²) - 6) * (y / √(x² + y²)) ), 2z ]

At the point of tangency, the gradients must be scalar multiples of each other. So, there exists a λ such that:

2x = λ * [ 2(√(x² + y²) - 6) * (x / √(x² + y²)) ]
2y = λ * [ 2(√(x² + y²) - 6) * (y / √(x² + y²)) ]
2z = λ * 2z

From the third equation, 2z = λ * 2z. If z ≠ 0, then λ = 1. If z = 0, then the point is in the x-y plane.

Let me consider two cases: z ≠ 0 and z = 0.

Case 1: z ≠ 0.

Then λ = 1.

Substituting into the first equation:

2x = 1 * [ 2(√(x² + y²) - 6) * (x / √(x² + y²)) ]

Simplify:

2x = 2(√(x² + y²) - 6)(x / √(x² + y²))

Divide both sides by 2:

x = (√(x² + y²) - 6)(x / √(x² + y²))

Let me denote s = √(x² + y²), so s ≥ 0.

Then equation becomes:

x = (s - 6)(x / s )

Multiply both sides by s:

s x = (s - 6) x

Bring all terms to left:

s x - (s - 6) x = 0 ⇒ [s - (s - 6)] x = 6 x = 0

So 6x = 0 ⇒ x = 0

Similarly, from the second equation:

2y = [ 2(s - 6) y / s ]

Same steps:

y = (s - 6) y / s

Multiply both sides by s:

s y = (s -6) y ⇒ [s - (s - 6)] y = 6 y = 0 ⇒ y = 0

So the only solution in this case is x = y = 0, but then s = 0, which would lead to √(0) = 0, so s = 0. Then s - 6 = -6, and gradient components become:

∇F = [0, 0, 2z] and ∇Sphere = [0, 0, 2z]

But for the torus equation, if s = 0, then (√(0) -6)^2 + z^2 = 9 ⇒ (-6)^2 + z^2 = 9 ⇒ 36 + z^2 = 9 ⇒ z^2 = -27, which is impossible. So no real solution in this case.

Therefore, the points of tangency must lie in the x-y plane (z = 0). So let's consider z = 0.

Case 2: z = 0.

Then the sphere equation becomes x² + y² = 11² = 121

The torus equation becomes (√(x² + y²) -6)^2 + 0 = 9 ⇒ (√(x² + y²) -6)^2 = 9.

Take square roots:

√(x² + y²) -6 = ±3 ⇒ √(x² + y²) = 6 ±3.

So √(x² + y²) = 9 or √(x² + y²) = 3.

So in the x-y plane, the torus intersects the sphere at two circles: one with radius 9 and another with radius 3.

But wait, the sphere has radius 11, so the circle at radius 9 is inside the sphere, and at radius 3 is also inside.

But how does tangency come into play here? Because if the torus is inside the sphere, it must touch the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it must touch along another circle.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the distance between centers. But in this problem, both the sphere and the torus are centered at the same point (0,0,0). So that might not be the right approach.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. When the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, perhaps it's not centered at the origin. Maybe it's placed such that its center is offset from the sphere's center. Similarly, when it's resting on the outside, it's externally tangent.

Wait, but the problem says "when T rests on the inside of S, it is internally tangent along a circle," and similarly for the outside. So perhaps the torus is placed such that it's inside the sphere, touching it along a circle, and when it's outside, it's touching along another circle.

Wait, so maybe the torus is not centered at the origin but is moved such that the distance between the sphere's center and the torus's center is such that it's tangent along a circle.

That makes more sense. So when the torus is inside the sphere, it's placed so that it is tangent, and when it's outside, it's placed externally tangent.

So in that case, the centers are separated by some distance. Let me denote the center of the sphere as O, and the center of the torus as C.

The torus is a surface of revolution, so its "center" is a point along its axis. So when it's placed inside the sphere, the center of the torus is at some point along a line from the sphere's center, and the distance between O and C is such that the sphere and torus are tangent.

Similarly, when it's outside, the center is on the opposite side, and the distance is adjusted so that they are tangent.

So the sphere has radius 11, and the torus has major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3.

Wait, but for a torus, the distance from its center to any point on its surface is either R + r or R - r, depending on whether you're on the outer or inner part. But when the torus is offset from the sphere's center, the point of tangency would be along the line connecting the centers.

So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center would be along the line connecting O to C. Similarly, the farthest point would be in the opposite direction.

Wait, perhaps the distance between O and C is such that the sphere and torus touch at exactly one point, but in the problem, it says they are tangent along a circle. Hmm, maybe when the sphere and torus are tangent along a circle, the circle lies in a plane perpendicular to the line connecting O and C.

So, let me consider the internal tangency first. Let the center of the sphere be O, the center of the torus be C, and the distance between O and C is d.

The sphere has radius 11, and the torus has major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the minimal distance from O to the torus's surface is d - (R + r), because the torus's outer radius is R + r = 9. But wait, that would be the case if the torus is a solid donut, but in reality, the torus is a surface, so the minimal distance from O to the torus's surface is |d - (R + r)|. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the sphere and the torus touching along a circle. So, the sphere and torus share a common tangent plane at every point along that circle. Therefore, the points of tangency lie on a circle that's in a plane perpendicular to the line OC.

Let me denote the distance between O and C as d. For internal tangency, the sphere and torus touch along a circle; the sphere has radius 11, and the torus is a surface with major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3.

Wait, to find the points where the sphere and torus are tangent, the distance from O to C must satisfy certain conditions.

I think the key is that the sphere and torus are tangent along a circle, so the distance from O to the torus's center must be such that the sphere and torus intersect in a circle.

Wait, maybe I can model the problem in 2D first, considering the cross-section. Let's imagine slicing both the sphere and the torus with a plane that contains the line connecting O and C. In this cross-section, the sphere would be a circle of radius 11, and the torus would appear as two circles (the cross-section of the torus is two circles when sliced along the axis).

Wait, no. The cross-section of a torus along its axis is two circles. Hmm, perhaps not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the point where the sphere and torus are tangent. At that point, the normals to both surfaces are colinear. So, using the gradient condition.

Let me denote the point of tangency as P. Let me consider the sphere centered at O (0,0,0) and the torus centered at C (d, 0, 0), along the x-axis. So the distance between O and C is d.

In this case, the sphere's equation is x² + y² + z² = 121.

The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around the x-axis, which is at a distance of 6 from the center of the circle. Wait, but if the torus is centered at (d, 0, 0), then the generating circle's center is at (d, 0, 0), and the axis of revolution is the x-axis. Wait, no, the axis of revolution for the torus is the line around which the generating circle is revolved. So if the torus is centered at (d, 0, 0), then the generating circle's center is at (d, 0, 0), and the axis is the x-axis, which passes through (0,0,0). Wait, that might not make sense. Maybe the axis is the x-axis, so the generating circle is at (d, 0, 0), and the axis is the x-axis, which is a distance of |d| from the generating circle's center.

Wait, no, the major radius R is 6, so the distance from the generating circle's center to the axis is 6. So if the generating circle's center is at (d, 0, 0), and the axis is the x-axis (which is the line y=0, z=0), then the distance is zero, which contradicts R=6. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the torus is such that the generating circle is at a distance 6 from the axis. So if the axis is the x-axis, then the generating circle is in the x-y plane, centered at (d, 0, 0), and with radius 3. Therefore, the distance from the generating circle's center to the axis (x-axis) is the distance from (d,0,0) to the x-axis, which is zero. Hmm, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the axis is not the x-axis in this case. Maybe I should choose the axis of the torus to be along the line connecting the centers O and C, which is the x-axis. So the generating circle is in a plane perpendicular to the x-axis, centered at some point along the x-axis. Wait, but the major radius R is 6, so the generating circle is offset by 6 units from the axis.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.

The torus can be represented parametrically. Let me recall that a torus can be parametrized as:

x = (R + r cos θ) cos φ
y = (R + r cos θ) sin φ
z = r sin θ

where θ and φ are angles, R is the major radius, and r is the minor radius.

In our case, R=6 and r=3. So:

x = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ
y = (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ
z = 3 sin θ

Now, the sphere is centered at (0,0,0) with radius 11. So the equation is x² + y² + z² = 121.

When the torus is inside the sphere, and tangent along a circle, the point (x,y,z) on the torus must satisfy both the torus equations and the sphere equation, and their normals must align.

But perhaps another way is to find the points where the distance from the origin to a point on the torus is equal to 11.

So, substituting the parametric equations into the sphere's equation:

[(6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ]^2 + [(6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ]^2 + (3 sin θ)^2 = 121

Simplify the first two terms:

(6 + 3 cos θ)^2 (cos² φ + sin² φ) = (6 + 3 cos θ)^2

So, the equation becomes:

(6 + 3 cos θ)^2 + (3 sin θ)^2 = 121

Let me expand this:

= 6² + 2*6*3 cos θ + (3 cos θ)^2 + 9 sin² θ
= 36 + 36 cos θ + 9 cos² θ + 9 sin² θ
= 36 + 36 cos θ + 9 (cos² θ + sin² θ)
= 36 + 36 cos θ + 9 (1)
= 36 + 36 cos θ + 9
= 45 + 36 cos θ

Set this equal to 121:

45 + 36 cos θ = 121 ⇒ 36 cos θ = 76 ⇒ cos θ = 76 / 36 = 19 / 9 ≈ 2.111...

Wait, that's impossible because the maximum value of cos θ is 1. So that suggests there's no solution. But that can't be right, because the torus is inside the sphere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Because when the torus is inside the sphere, the points on the torus that are farthest from the center are at a distance of R + r = 6 + 3 = 9, which is less than the sphere's radius of 11. So every point on the torus is inside the sphere, but they are tangent along a circle. So the points of tangency must lie where the distance from the origin is equal to 11, which is the sphere's radius.

Wait, but according to the calculation above, 45 + 36 cos θ = 121 ⇒ cos θ = (121 - 45)/36 = 76/36 = 19/9, which is greater than 1. So that's impossible.

Hmm, maybe I need to rethink this. Perhaps when the torus is inside the sphere, it's not centered at the origin, but shifted so that the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center is such that the farthest point on the torus reaches the sphere's surface.

Wait, perhaps I should model the torus as being shifted along the x-axis. Let me denote the center of the torus as being at (d, 0, 0). So, the torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around the x-axis, which is at a distance of 6 from the center of the generating circle.

Wait, no. Wait, the major radius R is 6, which is the distance from the generating circle's center to the axis of revolution. So, if the generating circle is at (d, 0, 0), and the axis is the x-axis, then the distance is |d|, but we have R=6. So |d|=6. Hmm, so the center of the generating circle is at (6, 0, 0), and the axis is the x-axis.

Wait, but the torus is being placed inside the sphere, so its center is at (6, 0, 0), and the sphere is at (0,0,0) with radius 11. So the distance between the centers is 6. Then, the farthest point on the torus from the sphere's center would be the distance from (0,0,0) to (6 + 3, 0, 0) = (9,0,0), which is 9. Since 9 < 11, the torus is entirely inside the sphere.

But how does this lead to tangency? Wait, perhaps when the torus is inside the sphere, the point of tangency is at (9, 0, 0), but the sphere has radius 11, so that point is inside. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps when the torus is inside the sphere, it's touching the sphere along a circle, which would mean that the sphere and torus share a common circle where their surfaces touch. Similarly, when it's outside, they touch along another circle.

Let me go back to the parametrization approach.

The sphere's equation is x² + y² + z² = 121.

The torus is given by (√(x² + y²) - 6)^2 + z² = 9.

To find the points of tangency, we can set up the condition that the gradients are colinear.

Compute the gradients:

Sphere: ∇Sphere = (2x, 2y, 2z)

Torus: Let F = (√(x² + y²) - 6)^2 + z^2 - 9.

So, ∇F = [ (2(√(x² + y²) -6) * (x/√(x²+y²)), (2(√(x² + y²) -6) * (y/√(x²+y²)), 2z ) ]

At the point of tangency, ∇Sphere = λ ∇F for some λ.

So,

2x = λ * [ 2(√(x² + y²) -6) * (x / √(x² + y²)) ]

2y = λ * [ 2(√(x² + y²) -6) * (y / √(x² + y²)) ]

2z = λ * 2z

Let me analyze these equations.

First, from the third equation:

2z = λ * 2z ⇒ if z ≠ 0, then λ = 1.

If z = 0, then the point is in the x-y plane.

Case 1: z ≠ 0, so λ = 1.

Then, from the first equation:

2x = 2(√(x² + y²) -6) * (x / √(x² + y²))

Divide both sides by 2:

x = (√(x² + y²) -6) * (x / √(x² + y²)) )

Let me denote s = √(x² + y²). Then:

x = (s -6) * (x / s )

Multiply both sides by s:

s x = (s -6) x ⇒ s x - s x +6x =0 ⇒ 6x =0 ⇒ x=0

Similarly, from the second equation:

2y = 2(s -6) * (y / s )

Divide by 2:

y = (s -6) (y / s )

Multiply both sides by s:

s y = (s -6) y ⇒ s y - s y +6 y =0 ⇒ 6 y=0 ⇒ y=0

So, if z ≠0, then x=0 and y=0. Then, s=0, which implies from the torus equation:

(s -6)^2 + z^2 =9 ⇒ (-6)^2 + z^2=9 ⇒ 36 + z^2=9 ⇒ z^2= -27, which is impossible. So no solution in this case.

Case 2: z=0.

Then, the sphere equation becomes x² + y² =121.

The torus equation becomes (s -6)^2 =9 ⇒ s=6±3 ⇒ s=9 or s=3.

So the points of tangency lie on the circles x² + y²=9²=81 and x² + y²=3²=9.

But the sphere has radius 11, so x² + y²=81 is inside the sphere, and x² + y²=9 is also inside.

But the problem states that when the torus is inside the sphere, it is tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when outside, along r_o.

Wait, but according to this, the points of tangency lie on two circles: one of radius 9 and another of radius 3. So, perhaps when the torus is inside the sphere, it is tangent along the circle of radius 9, and when it's outside, it's tangent along the circle of radius 3.

Wait, but when the torus is inside the sphere, the circle of radius 9 is still inside the sphere (since sphere's radius is 11), and the circle of radius 3 is even smaller. So how does external tangency work?

Alternatively, maybe when the torus is outside the sphere, the points of tangency are on the circle of radius 3, because the torus is larger.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think differently.

The torus has two radii: R=6 (distance from center to generating circle) and r=3 (radius of generating circle). So, the maximum distance from the center of the torus to any point on the torus is R + r = 9, and the minimum is R - r = 3.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, the maximal distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface is 9, which is less than the sphere's radius of 11. So, the torus is entirely inside the sphere, but the point of tangency is where the torus's surface is closest to the sphere's surface. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's touching the sphere along a circle where the sphere's surface is closest to the torus's inner edge. Similarly, when it's outside, it's touching along a circle where the sphere's surface is closest to the torus's outer edge.

Wait, perhaps the circle of tangency when the torus is inside has a radius r_i = R + r + (something), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should consider the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center. Let me denote this distance as D.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the closest distance from the sphere's center to the torus is D - (R + r), and since the sphere's radius is 11, the closest point on the torus must be at a distance of 11 - (D - (R + r))? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the points of tangency lie on a circle where the distance from the sphere's center is equal to 11, and the distance from the torus's center is equal to either R + r or R - r, depending on internal or external.

Wait, maybe we can model the torus as a surface with its own center C, and the sphere is centered at O. The distance between O and C is D.

For internal tangency, the points of contact lie on a circle where the distance from O to any point on the circle is 11, and the distance from C to any point on the circle is R + r = 9.

So, using the law of cosines in triangle OCP, where P is a point on the circle of tangency:

OP = 11, CP = 9, and angle between OC and CP is 90 degrees because the circle lies in a plane perpendicular to OC.

Wait, no, because the circle is in a plane perpendicular to OC, so the triangle OCP is right-angled at P.

So, OP² = OC² + CP² ⇒ 11² = D² + 9² ⇒ D² = 121 - 81 = 40 ⇒ D = √40 = 2√10.

Similarly, for external tangency, the points of contact lie on a circle where OP = 11, and CP = R - r = 3.

Again, in the right triangle OCP:

OP² = OC² + CP² ⇒ 11² = D² + 3² ⇒ D² = 121 - 9 = 112 ⇒ D = √112 = 4√7.

But wait, when the torus is inside the sphere, the distance D between centers is 2√10, and when it's outside, it's 4√7.

But how does this relate to the radii r_i and r_o of the circles of tangency?

Because the circle of tangency lies in a plane perpendicular to OC, the radius of the circle can be found from the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by OC, the radius of the circle (let's say r_i or r_o), and the distance from the center of the circle (C) to the point P.

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the radius of the circle of tangency is the radius of the cross-section of the sphere and torus in the plane perpendicular to OC.

In that plane, the sphere would have a circle of radius sqrt(OP² - D²), but wait, no.

Wait, in the plane perpendicular to OC, the sphere intersects in a circle of radius sqrt(11² - D²) = sqrt(121 - D²), and the torus intersects in a circle of radius sqrt(9² - (distance from C to the plane)^2). Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the radius of the circle of tangency is the same as the radius of the cross-section of the sphere in that plane.

Wait, but in the plane perpendicular to OC at distance D, the sphere would have a circle of radius sqrt(11² - D²), and the torus would have a circle of radius sqrt(9² - (something)^2).

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's think again.

The circle of tangency lies in a plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers O and C. The radius of this circle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the sphere and torus.

For the sphere, the radius of the circle is sqrt(11² - D²).

For the torus, the radius of the circle is sqrt(9² - (distance from C to the plane)^2). But since the plane is at a distance D from O, and the center C is along the line at distance D from O, then in the plane, the distance from C to the plane is zero? Wait, no, because the plane is passing through the point P, which is on the line OC. Wait, no, the plane is perpendicular to OC and passes through P, which is a point on OC.

Wait, perhaps the radius of the circle of tangency is the same for both the sphere and the torus, so we can set sqrt(11² - D²) = sqrt(9² - (distance from C to the plane)^2).

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: in the plane of tangency, which is perpendicular to OC, both the sphere and the torus intersect in circles. The sphere's circle has radius sqrt(11² - D²), and the torus's circle has radius sqrt(9² - (distance from C to the plane)^2). But since the plane is at distance D from O, and the center C is at distance D from O, then the distance from C to the plane is zero. So the torus's circle in that plane would have radius 9.

But that can't be, because the sphere's circle would have radius sqrt(121 - D²). So setting them equal:

sqrt(121 - D²) = 9 ⇒ 121 - D² = 81 ⇒ D² = 40 ⇒ D = 2√10.

Which matches the earlier result.

Similarly, for external tangency, the torus's circle in the plane would have radius 3, so:

sqrt(121 - D²) = 3 ⇒ 121 - D² = 9 ⇒ D² = 112 ⇒ D = 4√7.

Therefore, the radii of the circles of tangency are 9 and 3, respectively.

Wait, but the problem states that when the torus is inside, it's tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when outside, r_o. But according to this, r_i is 9 and r_o is 3, so r_i - r_o = 6.

Wait, but the problem says that the difference can be written as m/n, which would be 6/1, so m +n=7.

But that seems too straightforward. Did I do everything correctly?

Wait, let me re-examine. When the torus is inside, the circle of tangency has radius 9, and when it's outside, radius 3. So difference is 6. So m=6, n=1, m +n=7.

Is that correct?

Wait, but in the problem statement, when the torus is inside, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, which I thought was 9, but that's the radius in the x-y plane. But actually, in the problem, the sphere is radius 11, so a circle of radius 9 would lie inside the sphere.

Wait, but earlier I considered that the sphere and torus are both centered at the origin, but when the torus is inside, it's shifted such that the distance between centers is D=2√10, and the circle of tangency has radius 9. Wait no, actually, in that case, the radius of the circle of tangency is 9, which is less than the sphere's radius.

Wait, but according to the calculation, when the torus is inside, the circle of tangency has radius 9, and when it's outside, radius 3. So the difference is 6.

But let me check the problem statement again. It says, "when T rests on the inside of S, it is internally tangent to S along a circle with radius r_i, and when T rests on the outside of S, it is externally tangent to S along a circle with radius r_o."

So, in the internal case, the circle of tangency is inside S, but the radius is r_i, which is the radius of the circle on S where they are tangent.

Wait, no, the circle lies on both S and T. So, the circle is a circle on the sphere's surface, so its radius is measured on the sphere's surface. But in 3D space, the radius of the circle would be r = 11 sin θ, where θ is the polar angle from the center.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the radius in 3D space with the radius on the sphere's surface. Let me clarify.

The circle of tangency lies on both the sphere and the torus. The radius of the circle, as measured in 3D space, is sqrt(11² - D²) where D is the distance from the sphere's center to the plane of the circle.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, when the torus is inside, the radius of the circle is 9, which is less than the sphere's radius. So the circle lies on the sphere's surface, but its 3D radius is 9. Similarly, when it's outside, the circle's 3D radius is 3.

But wait, in 3D space, a circle on a sphere of radius R with the circle at a distance d from the center has a radius of sqrt(R² - d²).

Wait, so in the internal tangency case, the circle of tangency is at a distance D from the center, and its radius is sqrt(11² - D²). But we found that in the internal case, D=2√10, so sqrt(121 - (2√10)^2) = sqrt(121 - 40) = sqrt(81) =9. So the radius is 9.

Similarly, for external tangency, D=4√7, so sqrt(121 - (4√7)^2) = sqrt(121 - 112)=sqrt(9)=3.

So the radii of the circles of tangency are 9 and 3, so r_i - r_o=9-3=6.

But the problem asks for the difference, so 6 is an integer, which can be written as 6/1. So m=6, n=1, m +n=7.

But the problem mentions that the difference is m/n where m and n are coprime. 6 and 1 are coprime, so yes.

So the answer is 7.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the torus \( T \) and the sphere \( S \) with radii 11. The torus has a major radius \( R = 6 \) and a minor radius \( r = 3 \). When the torus is inside the sphere, it is internally tangent along a circle with radius \( r_i \), and when it is outside, it is externally tangent along a circle with radius \( r_o \). We need to find \( r_i - r_o \) and express it as a fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \), then compute \( m + n \).

1. **Internal Tangency**:
   - The torus is inside the sphere, and the points of tangency lie on a circle. The distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center is \( D \).
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers, we find:
     \[
     11^2 = D^2 + 9^2 \implies D^2 = 121 - 81 = 40 \implies D = 2\sqrt{10}.
     \]
   - The radius of the circle of tangency is \( r_i = 9 \).

2. **External Tangency**:
   - The torus is outside the sphere, and the points of tangency lie on another circle. Using the same approach:
     \[
     11^2 = D^2 + 3^2 \implies D^2 = 121 - 9 = 112 \implies D = 4\sqrt{7}.
     \]
   - The radius of the circle of tangency is \( r_o = 3 \).

3. **Difference**:
   - The difference \( r_i - r_o = 9 - 3 = 6 \).
   - Expressing this as a fraction \( \frac{6}{1} \), we find \( m = 6 \) and \( n = 1 \), giving \( m + n = 7 \).

Thus, the final answer is \( \boxed{7} \).
