Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the greatest four-digit number N such that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, let's understand the problem. N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. The property it has is that if any single digit is replaced by 1, the new number is divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is ABCD, then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, and so on, each of which should be divisible by 7.

Since we're looking for the greatest such number, it makes sense to start checking from 9999 downwards until we find a number that satisfies this condition. But that might take too long manually, so I should think of some properties or constraints that can help me narrow it down.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So, A is from 1 to 9, and B, C, D are from 0 to 9.

The condition is that changing any digit to 1 should make the number divisible by 7. So, let's think about each possible change:

1. Changing A to 1: The number becomes 1BCD. So, 1BCD must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing B to 1: The number becomes A1CD. This must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing C to 1: The number becomes AB1D. This must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing D to 1: The number becomes ABC1. This must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these four numbers must be congruent to 0 mod 7.

Let me think about how to model this. Let’s express each modified number in terms of N.

Wait, N is ABCD, so N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Now, when we change A to 1, the new number is 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Let's denote this as N1.

Similarly, changing B to 1: the number is 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. Let's call this N2.

Changing C to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D. Let's call this N3.

Changing D to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C +1. Let's call this N4.

Each of N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7,
N2 ≡ 0 mod 7,
N3 ≡ 0 mod 7,
N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Now, let me express each N in terms of N.

But wait, N is ABCD. Let me see if I can express N1, N2, N3, N4 in terms of N.

N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + (N - 1000A) because N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, N1 = 1000 + N - 1000A.

Similarly, N2 = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + (10C + D) = 1000A + 100 + (N - 1000A - 100B).

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Let me think differently.

Let me denote N1, N2, N3, N4 as follows:

N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + (N - 1000A) because N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, N1 = 1000 + N - 1000A.

Similarly, N2 = A1CD = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D = N - 100B + 100.

Because N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D, so subtracting 100B and adding 100 gives N - 100B + 100.

Similarly, N3 = AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D = N - 10C + 10.

And N4 = ABC1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 = N - D + 1.

So, N1 = 1000 + N - 1000A,
N2 = N - 100B + 100,
N3 = N - 10C + 10,
N4 = N - D + 1.

Each of these must be divisible by 7. So:

N1 ≡ 0 mod 7,
N2 ≡ 0 mod 7,
N3 ≡ 0 mod 7,
N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which can be rewritten as:

1000 + N - 1000A ≡ 0 mod 7,
N - 100B + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7,
N - 10C + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7,
N - D + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Let me think about each of these congruences.

First, let's compute each expression mod 7.

Let me note that 1000 mod 7: 1000 ÷ 7 is 142*7=994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7: 100 ÷7 is 14*7=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3, and 1 mod7 is 1.

So, let's compute each N1, N2, N3, N4 modulo7.

1. N1 ≡ (6 + N - (1000A mod7)) mod7.

But 1000A ≡ 6A mod7. So,

N1 ≡ 6 + N - 6A mod7 ≡ 0 mod7.

Similarly,

2. N2 ≡ N - (100B mod7) + (100 mod7) mod7.

100B ≡ 2B mod7,

100 ≡ 2 mod7.

So,

N2 ≡ (N - 2B + 2) mod7 ≡ 0 mod7.

3. N3 ≡ N - (10C mod7) + (10 mod7) mod7.

10C ≡ 3C mod7,

10 ≡ 3 mod7.

So,

N3 ≡ (N -3C +3) mod7 ≡0 mod7.

4. N4 ≡ N - (D mod7) +1 mod7 ≡ (N - D +1) mod7 ≡0 mod7.

So now, the four congruences are:

1. N -6A +6 ≡0 mod7. (since 6 + N -6A ≡0)
2. N -2B +2 ≡0 mod7.
3. N -3C +3 ≡0 mod7.
4. N - D +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, we can write these as:

1. N ≡6A -6 mod7.
2. N ≡2B -2 mod7.
3. N ≡3C -3 mod7.
4. N ≡D -1 mod7.

So, that's a system of congruences. Since N must satisfy all four, all four expressions for N mod7 must be equal.

So, 6A -6 ≡2B -2 ≡3C -3 ≡D -1 mod7.

Let me denote this common value as K. So,

6A -6 ≡ K mod7,
2B -2 ≡ K mod7,
3C -3 ≡ K mod7,
D -1 ≡ K mod7.

So,

6(A -1) ≡ K mod7,
2(B -1) ≡ K mod7,
3(C -1) ≡ K mod7,
(D -1) ≡ K mod7.

So, each of these expressions is congruent modulo7.

So, 6(A -1) ≡2(B -1) ≡3(C -1) ≡(D -1) mod7.

Let me think about how to model this. Maybe express each in terms of K.

But perhaps it's better to note that all of these must be equal, so for some integer K, these expressions are equal to K mod7.

Alternatively, since all four expressions are equal, their differences must be 0 mod7.

So, 6(A -1) -2(B -1) ≡0 mod7,
6(A -1) -3(C -1) ≡0 mod7,
2(B -1) - (D -1) ≡0 mod7,
3(C -1) - (D -1) ≡0 mod7.

Wait, maybe that's getting too involved. Let me think about each digit.

Since N is the greatest four-digit number, we can start from 9999 and work our way down, checking each number to see if it satisfies the condition.

But that's going to be time-consuming. Maybe I can find some constraints on the digits.

Looking at the four congruences:

From D: D ≡ K +1 mod7.

From C: 3(C -1) ≡ K mod7, so K ≡3(C -1) mod7.

From B: 2(B -1) ≡ K mod7.

From A: 6(A -1) ≡ K mod7.

So, since 3(C -1) ≡2(B -1) mod7,

and 2(B -1) ≡6(A -1) mod7.

Similarly, 3(C -1) ≡6(A -1) mod7.

Let me try to solve these equations.

First, from 2(B -1) ≡6(A -1) mod7.

Simplify: 2(B -1) -6(A -1) ≡0 mod7.

Let me factor:

2(B -1 - 3(A -1)) ≡0 mod7.

But 7 is prime, so 2 and 7 are coprime. So,

(B -1 -3(A -1)) ≡0 mod7.

So,

B -1 ≡3(A -1) mod7.

Which can be written as,

B ≡3A -3 +1 mod7,

B ≡3A -2 mod7.

Similarly, let's look at the relation between K and A, B, C, D.

We have K ≡6(A -1) mod7.

From B: 2(B -1) ≡K mod7.

Substituting K,

2(B -1) ≡6(A -1) mod7.

Which is what we just had.

Similarly, K ≡3(C -1) mod7.

So, 3(C -1) ≡6(A -1) mod7.

Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and7 are coprime, division is allowed).

C -1 ≡2(A -1) mod7,

C ≡2A -2 +1 mod7,

C ≡2A -1 mod7.

Similarly, from D: D ≡K +1 mod7.

But K ≡6(A -1) mod7, so D ≡6(A -1) +1 mod7.

Let me write all of these:

B ≡3A -2 mod7,

C ≡2A -1 mod7,

D ≡6(A -1) +1 mod7 =6A -6 +1=6A -5 mod7.

So, all digits B, C, D are expressed in terms of A modulo7.

So, given A, we can compute B, C, D modulo7.

But since B, C, D are digits (0-9), their actual values can be written as:

B = (3A -2) mod7 +7k, where k is 0 or 1, such that B is between 0 and 9.

Similarly,

C = (2A -1) mod7 +7m,

D = (6A -5) mod7 +7n,

where k, m, n are integers such that B, C, D are between 0 and9.

But since we're looking for the maximum N, which is a four-digit number, we can start by assuming A=9, since we want the largest possible number.

So, let's try A=9.

Compute:

B ≡3*9 -2 mod7,

3*9=27, 27-2=25. 25 mod7: 7*3=21, 25-21=4. So B≡4 mod7. Since B is a digit, possible values are 4 and 4+7=11, but 11 is invalid, so B=4.

C ≡2*9 -1 mod7=18-1=17 mod7. 17-14=3. So C≡3 mod7. So C can be 3 or 10, but 10 is invalid. So C=3.

D ≡6*9 -5 mod7=54-5=49 mod7=0. So D≡0 mod7, so D=0 or 7.

So, for A=9, digits are B=4, C=3, D=0 or 7.

So, the number N could be 9430 or 9437.

But wait, we're looking for the greatest such number, so we should check 9437 first.

But wait, let's check if this number satisfies the condition that changing any digit to 1 makes it divisible by7.

So, let's test N=9437.

First, changing A to 1: 1437.

Is 1437 divisible by7? Let's check.

1437 ÷7: 7*205=1435, so 1437-1435=2. So remainder 2. Not divisible by7. So N=9437 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Hmm, so this approach is not working. Maybe the problem is that while the digits satisfy the congruence mod7, the actual numbers when changing digits may not necessarily be divisible by7 because the congruence only gives the remainder, but the actual numbers could be off by multiples of7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier reasoning. Let me double-check.

We have:

N1 =1000 + N -1000A ≡0 mod7,

Which gives N ≡6A -6 mod7.

Similarly for other digits.

But perhaps I should model it differently. Let's think about N1, N2, N3, N4 each being divisible by7.

So, N1 =1BCD must be divisible by7,

N2 =A1CD must be divisible by7,

N3 =AB1D must be divisible by7,

N4 =ABC1 must be divisible by7.

So, perhaps I can use these four divisibility conditions to set up equations.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can write N in terms of its digits and set up equations based on the divisibility.

Alternatively, maybe I can note that N1, N2, N3, N4 are all divisible by7, so their differences can be considered.

For example, N2 - N1 = (A1CD) - (1BCD) = A1CD -1BCD = (A -1)1000 + (1 - B)100 + (C - C)10 + (D - D) = (A-1)*1000 + (1 - B)*100.

Similarly, since both N2 and N1 are divisible by7, their difference must also be divisible by7.

So, (A-1)*1000 + (1 - B)*100 ≡0 mod7.

But 1000 ≡6 mod7, 100≡2 mod7.

So,

(A-1)*6 + (1 - B)*2 ≡0 mod7.

Which is 6(A-1) +2(1 - B) ≡0 mod7.

Which is 6A -6 +2 -2B ≡0 mod7.

So, 6A -2B -4 ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, from another difference.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to set up equations based on the four conditions.

But this is getting a bit involved. Maybe another approach is better.

Let me think about N itself. Since N1, N2, N3, N4 are all divisible by7, perhaps N has some relation to these numbers.

But I'm not sure. Let me think differently.

Suppose that when any digit is replaced by1, the number is divisible by7. So, for example, replacing the thousands digit with1 gives a number divisible by7, same for hundreds, tens, units.

So, N1 =1BCD ≡0 mod7,

N2 =A1CD ≡0 mod7,

N3 =AB1D ≡0 mod7,

N4 =ABC1 ≡0 mod7.

Let me express each of these in terms of N.

N1 =1000 + 100B +10C + D = 1000 + (N - 1000A).

So, N1 = N -1000A +1000.

Since N1 ≡0 mod7,

N -1000A +1000 ≡0 mod7,

But 1000 ≡6 mod7,

So,

N -1000A +6 ≡0 mod7,

But 1000A ≡6A mod7,

So,

N -6A +6 ≡0 mod7,

Which gives N ≡6A -6 mod7.

Similarly, for N2: A1CD = 1000A + 100 +10C + D = N -100B +100.

So, N2 = N -100B +100.

N2 ≡0 mod7,

So,

N -100B +100 ≡0 mod7,

100 ≡2 mod7,

So,

N -2B +2 ≡0 mod7,

Thus, N ≡2B -2 mod7.

Similarly, for N3: AB1D =1000A +100B +10 + D = N -10C +10.

So, N3 = N -10C +10.

N3 ≡0 mod7,

So,

N -10C +10 ≡0 mod7,

10 ≡3 mod7,

Thus,

N -3C +3 ≡0 mod7,

So, N ≡3C -3 mod7.

For N4: ABC1 =1000A +100B +10C +1 = N - D +1.

So, N4 = N - D +1.

N4 ≡0 mod7,

Thus,

N - D +1 ≡0 mod7,

So,

N ≡D -1 mod7.

So, now we have:

N ≡6A -6 mod7,

N ≡2B -2 mod7,

N ≡3C -3 mod7,

N ≡D -1 mod7.

So, all four congruences must hold.

Therefore, the four expressions:

6A -6 ≡2B -2 ≡3C -3 ≡D -1 mod7.

So, all four must be congruent mod7.

Let me denote this common value as K. So,

6A -6 ≡ K mod7,

2B -2 ≡ K mod7,

3C -3 ≡ K mod7,

D -1 ≡ K mod7.

So,

6(A -1) ≡ K mod7,

2(B -1) ≡ K mod7,

3(C -1) ≡ K mod7,

(D -1) ≡ K mod7.

So, let's solve for each variable in terms of K.

From the first equation:

6(A -1) ≡ K mod7.

Since 6 and7 are coprime, we can multiply both sides by the inverse of6 mod7. The inverse of6 mod7 is6, since6*6=36≡1 mod7.

So, multiplying both sides by6:

6*6(A -1) ≡6K mod7,

36(A -1) ≡6K mod7,

But36≡1 mod7,

So,

(A -1) ≡6K mod7,

Thus,

A ≡6K +1 mod7.

Similarly, from the second equation:

2(B -1) ≡ K mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of2 mod7, which is4, since2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So,

2*4*(B -1) ≡4K mod7,

8(B -1) ≡4K mod7,

8≡1 mod7,

Thus,

(B -1) ≡4K mod7,

So,

B ≡4K +1 mod7.

From the third equation:

3(C -1) ≡ K mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of3 mod7, which is5, since3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So,

3*5*(C -1) ≡5K mod7,

15(C -1) ≡5K mod7,

15≡1 mod7,

So,

C -1 ≡5K mod7,

Thus,

C ≡5K +1 mod7.

From the fourth equation:

D -1 ≡ K mod7,

So,

D ≡ K +1 mod7.

So, now we have expressions for A, B, C, D in terms of K:

A ≡6K +1 mod7,

B ≡4K +1 mod7,

C ≡5K +1 mod7,

D ≡K +1 mod7.

But since A is the thousands digit, it must be between1 and9. So, A can be expressed as:

A =7m + (6K +1 mod7), where m is an integer ≥0, such that A ≤9.

Similarly for B, C, D:

B =7n + (4K +1 mod7), n ≥0, B ≤9.

C =7p + (5K +1 mod7), p ≥0, C ≤9.

D =7q + (K +1 mod7), q ≥0, D ≤9.

But since A, B, C, D are single digits (0-9 for B, C, D; 1-9 for A), we can find possible values for K.

But K is mod7, so K can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

Let me consider each possible K from0 to6 and see what values A, B, C, D take.

Let's tabulate:

For K=0:

A ≡6*0 +1=1 mod7. So A can be1,8.

But since we want the largest N, we can take A=8 or9. But wait, if K=0, A=1 or8. 8 is possible, but 9 is not congruent to1 mod7. Wait, 9 mod7=2, so if A=9, 9≡2 mod7. So, if K=0, A=8 is possible, since8≡1 mod7.

Wait, but 6K +1 mod7 when K=0 is1, so A=1,8.

Similarly,

B=4*0 +1=1 mod7. So B=1,8.

C=5*0 +1=1 mod7. So C=1,8.

D=0 +1=1 mod7. So D=1,8.

So, for K=0, digits are A=1 or8, B=1 or8, C=1 or8, D=1 or8.

But since we're looking for the maximum N, let's try A=8, B=8, C=8, D=8. So N=8888.

But does this satisfy the condition? Let's check.

If we change any digit to1, the number becomes1888, 8188, 8818, 8881.

Check if these are divisible by7.

1888 ÷7: 7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5. Not divisible.

So, K=0 doesn't work.

Next, K=1:

A ≡6*1 +1=7≡0 mod7. So A=7.

But A is the thousands digit, so must be ≥1. So A=7.

B=4*1 +1=5 mod7. So B=5,12. But 12 is invalid, so B=5.

C=5*1 +1=6 mod7. So C=6,13. 13 invalid, so C=6.

D=1 +1=2 mod7. So D=2,9.

So, digits would be A=7, B=5, C=6, D=2 or9.

So possible N=7562 or7569.

Check if these satisfy the conditions.

First, N=7569.

Check N1=1569. 1569 ÷7: 7*224=1568, 1569-1568=1. Not divisible.

So, 1569 not divisible by7. Thus, N=7569 doesn't work.

Next, N=7562.

Check N1=1562. 1562 ÷7=223*7=1561, 1562-1561=1. Not divisible.

So, K=1 doesn't work.

Next, K=2:

A=6*2 +1=13≡6 mod7. So A=6,13. But A must be ≤9, so A=6.

B=4*2 +1=9 mod7. 9 mod7=2. So B=2,9.

C=5*2 +1=11≡4 mod7. So C=4,11. 11 invalid, so C=4.

D=2 +1=3 mod7. So D=3,10. 10 invalid, so D=3.

So, digits: A=6, B=2 or9, C=4, D=3.

So possible N=6243,6943.

Check N=6943 first.

Check N1=1943. 1943 ÷7: 7*277=1939, 1943-1939=4. Not divisible.

So, N=6943 doesn't work.

Check N=6243.

N1=1243. 1243 ÷7=177*7=1239, 1243-1239=4. Not divisible.

So, K=2 doesn't work.

K=3:

A=6*3 +1=19≡5 mod7. So A=5,12. 12 invalid, so A=5.

B=4*3 +1=13≡6 mod7. So B=6,13. 13 invalid, so B=6.

C=5*3 +1=16≡2 mod7. So C=2,9.

D=3 +1=4 mod7. So D=4,11. 11 invalid, so D=4.

So, digits: A=5, B=6, C=2 or9, D=4.

Possible N=5624,5694.

Check N=5694.

N1=1694. 1694 ÷7=242 exactly, since7*242=1694. So N1 is divisible by7.

N2=5194. 5194 ÷7: 7*742=5194. Exactly. So N2 divisible.

N3=5614. 5614 ÷7=802, since7*800=5600, 7*2=14. So 7*802=5614. Divisible.

N4=5691. 5691 ÷7: 7*813=5691. Yes, since7*800=5600, plus7*13=91. So yes.

So, N=5694 satisfies all conditions.

Wait, but we're looking for the greatest four-digit number. So 5694 is a candidate, but perhaps a higher K could give a higher N.

Let me continue checking K=4.

K=4:

A=6*4 +1=25≡4 mod7. So A=4,11. 11 invalid, so A=4.

B=4*4 +1=17≡3 mod7. So B=3,10. 10 invalid, so B=3.

C=5*4 +1=21≡0 mod7. So C=0,7.

D=4 +1=5 mod7. So D=5,12. 12 invalid, so D=5.

So, digits: A=4, B=3, C=0 or7, D=5.

Possible N=4305,4375.

Check N=4375.

N1=1375. 1375 ÷7: 7*196=1372, 1375-1372=3. Not divisible.

So, N=4375 doesn't work.

N=4305.

N1=1305. 1305 ÷7=186*7=1302, 1305-1302=3. Not divisible.

So, K=4 doesn't work.

K=5:

A=6*5 +1=31≡3 mod7. So A=3,10. 10 invalid, so A=3.

B=4*5 +1=21≡0 mod7. So B=0,7.

C=5*5 +1=26≡5 mod7. So C=5,12. 12 invalid, so C=5.

D=5 +1=6 mod7. So D=6,13. 13 invalid, so D=6.

So, digits: A=3, B=0 or7, C=5, D=6.

Possible N=3056,3756.

Check N=3756.

N1=1756. 1756 ÷7=250*7=1750, 1756-1750=6. Not divisible.

So, doesn't work.

N=3056.

N1=1056. 1056 ÷7: 7*150=1050, 1056-1050=6. Not divisible.

So, K=5 doesn't work.

K=6:

A=6*6 +1=37≡2 mod7. So A=2,9.

B=4*6 +1=25≡4 mod7. So B=4,11. 11 invalid, so B=4.

C=5*6 +1=31≡3 mod7. So C=3,10. 10 invalid, so C=3.

D=6 +1=7 mod7≡0 mod7. So D=0,7.

So, digits: A=2 or9, B=4, C=3, D=0 or7.

Possible N=2430,2437,9430,9437.

We already saw earlier that 9437 didn't work because N1=1437 leaves a remainder of2 mod7.

Let's check N=9430.

Check N1=1430. 1430 ÷7: 7*204=1428, 1430-1428=2. Not divisible.

So, not good.

Next, N=9437 as before, didn't work.

Next, N=2437.

But since we're looking for the maximum, let's check N=9430 and 9437 first.

Wait, but earlier when K=6, A=2 or9. So if A=9, then N=9430 or9437.

As we saw, both didn't work.

Wait, but when K=3, we found N=5694 worked. So perhaps 5694 is the answer. But wait, maybe there's a higher N with a different K.

Wait, but let's think again. Earlier, when K=3, N=5694 worked. But maybe there are larger Ns beyond 5694.

Wait, but when K=6, we tried N=9437 and it didn't work. So perhaps the maximum N is 5694.

But let's make sure by checking N=5694.

Check all four modified numbers:

N1=1694. 1694 ÷7=242, exactly. So yes.

N2=5194 ÷7=742, exactly. Yes.

N3=5614 ÷7=802, exactly. Yes.

N4=5691 ÷7=813, exactly. Yes.

So, N=5694 satisfies all conditions.

But wait, when K=3, we got N=5694. But when K=6, A=9, but N=9430 and9437 didn't work. So perhaps 5694 is the maximum.

But wait, is there a larger N with a different K?

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe K=3 gives N=5694, but perhaps there's a higher N where K is different.

Wait, but let's consider that when K=3, A=5, which is less than9. So maybe there's a higher A with K=3?

Wait, no. Because K=3 gives A=5, B=6, C=2 or9, D=4.

Wait, but if we set C=9, then N=5694, which is the number we have. If C=2, N=5624, which is smaller.

So, 5694 is the maximum for K=3.

But let's think again. Maybe when K=3, A=5, but perhaps when K=3, there's a higher A.

Wait, no, because K=3 gives A=5, which is fixed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine K=3.

For K=3:

A=6*3 +1=19≡5 mod7. So A=5 or12, but 12 is invalid, so A=5.

So, A=5 is fixed. So, the maximum possible N for K=3 is 5694.

But let's check if there's a higher N with a different K.

Wait, when K=3, N=5694, which is less than 9999, but perhaps there's a higher N with a different K.

Wait, let's think. When K=3, N=5694. When K=6, we tried A=9, but the numbers didn't work. So perhaps 5694 is the maximum.

But wait, let's try another approach. Let's consider that when any digit is changed to1, the number is divisible by7. So, perhaps N has some relation to7.

Wait, but maybe N itself is not divisible by7, but all the modified numbers are.

Wait, but from the four conditions, N ≡6A -6, 2B -2, etc., which are all equal to K mod7.

But if N is 5694, let's compute 5694 mod7.

5694 ÷7=813.428... Let's compute 5694 mod7.

Compute 5694 /7:

7*800=5600,

5694 -5600=94.

94 ÷7=13*7=91, remainder3.

So, 5694≡3 mod7.

Which would correspond to K=3 mod7.

Which matches our earlier calculation.

But let's see if there's a higher N with K=3.

Wait, but A=5 is fixed for K=3. So, higher A would require higher K.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I can have A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4, giving N=5694, which is the maximum for K=3.

But let me check if there's a higher N with a different K.

Wait, when K=3, N=5694.

But when K=6, we tried N=9437, which didn't work, but perhaps another N with K=6 exists.

Wait, K=6, A=2 or9.

Wait, when A=9, B=4, C=3, D=0 or7.

So, possible N=9430,9437.

We saw that N=9437 didn't work because N1=1437≡2 mod7.

But let's check N=9430.

N1=1430. 1430 ÷7=204*7=1428, remainder2. Not divisible.

So, N=9430 doesn't work.

What about N=9430: changing B to1 gives N2=9130.

9130 ÷7: 7*1304=9128, remainder2. Not divisible.

So, doesn't work.

Thus, K=6 doesn't provide a valid N higher than 5694.

So, perhaps 5694 is the maximum.

But wait, let's check if there's a higher N for K=3 with higher digits.

Wait, but when K=3, A=5 is fixed. So, the maximum N with A=5 is 5999, but we need to check if such a number exists.

Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, for K=3, B=6, C=2 or9, D=4.

So, to maximize N, we set C=9, giving N=5694.

So, 5694 is the maximum for K=3.

Is there a higher N with a different K?

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe I missed some possibilities.

Wait, when K=3, A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4. So N=5694.

But what if I consider other possibilities where, for example, B is 6+7=13, which is invalid, so B=6 is the maximum for K=3.

Similarly, C=9 is the maximum for K=3, since C=5*3 +1=16≡2 mod7, so C=2 or9.

Thus, 5694 is the maximum for K=3.

Wait, but let me check N=5694.

Yes, it works.

But perhaps there's a higher N with a different K.

Wait, let me think. Let's try K=4 again.

Wait, K=4: A=4, B=3, C=0 or7, D=5.

So, possible N=4375, which didn't work.

But perhaps with A=4, B=3, C=7, D=5: N=4375.

Check N1=1375. 1375 mod7: 7*196=1372, 1375-1372=3. Not divisible.

So, doesn't work.

Alternatively, N=4305.

N1=1305 mod7: 1305-7*186=1305-1302=3. Not divisible.

So, K=4 doesn't work.

Similarly, K=5: N=3756 didn't work.

So, seems that 5694 is the maximum N.

Wait, but let me check N=5694.

Yes, it satisfies all four conditions.

So, now, the problem asks for Q + R, where Q is the quotient and R the remainder when N is divided by1000.

So, N=5694.

Divide by1000: 5*1000=5000, remainder 694.

So, Q=5, R=694.

Thus, Q + R=5 +694=699.

Wait, but let me confirm this.

Wait, 5694 ÷1000 is5 with remainder694.

Yes, so Q=5, R=694. So, Q+R=5+694=699.

But wait, earlier when I thought K=3 gives N=5694, which is correct. But I'm getting Q+R=699.

But wait, earlier when I tried K=3, I found N=5694, which is a four-digit number, and it satisfies all conditions.

But wait, is there a higher N that also satisfies the conditions?

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I missed higher Ns when K=3.

Wait, when K=3, A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4.

So, N=5694.

But what if I set D=4+7=11, which is invalid, so D=4 is the maximum.

Similarly, C=9 is the maximum for K=3.

So, 5694 is the maximum N for K=3.

Thus, the answer is Q + R =5 +694=699.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, earlier when I tried K=3, N=5694 worked. But when I tried K=6, I couldn't find a valid N, so 5694 is the maximum.

Thus, the answer is699.

To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Then, we find \( Q + R \) where \( Q \) is the quotient and \( R \) is the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Let \( N = ABCD \) where \( A, B, C, D \) are digits.
   - Changing any digit to 1 should result in a number divisible by 7. This gives four conditions:
     - \( 1BCD \) is divisible by 7.
     - \( A1CD \) is divisible by 7.
     - \( AB1D \) is divisible by 7.
     - \( ABC1 \) is divisible by 7.

2. **Expressing Conditions Modulo 7:**
   - Using modular arithmetic, we derive:
     - \( N \equiv 6A - 6 \mod 7 \)
     - \( N \equiv 2B - 2 \mod 7 \)
     - \( N \equiv 3C - 3 \mod 7 \)
     - \( N \equiv D - 1 \mod 7 \)
   - These must all be equal, leading to the common value \( K \mod 7 \).

3. **Solving for Digits:**
   - Express each digit in terms of \( K \):
     - \( A \equiv 6K + 1 \mod 7 \)
     - \( B \equiv 4K + 1 \mod 7 \)
     - \( C \equiv 5K + 1 \mod 7 \)
     - \( D \equiv K + 1 \mod 7 \)
   - Check possible values for \( K \) (0 to 6) to find valid digits.

4. **Finding the Maximum \( N \):**
   - For \( K = 3 \):
     - \( A = 5 \), \( B = 6 \), \( C = 9 \), \( D = 4 \)
     - \( N = 5694 \).
   - Verify \( N = 5694 \) satisfies all conditions:
     - \( 1694 \), \( 5194 \), \( 5614 \), \( 5691 \) are all divisible by 7.

5. **Calculating \( Q + R \):**
   - Divide \( N = 5694 \) by 1000:
     - \( Q = 5 \), \( R = 694 \)
     - \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \).

### Final Answer:
\boxed{699}
