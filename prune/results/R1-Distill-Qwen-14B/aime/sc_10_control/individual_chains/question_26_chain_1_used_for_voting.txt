Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me make sure I understand it first.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C meet at point D. Then, we draw line AD, which intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle, not right-angled because 5² + 9² is 25 + 81 = 106, which is not equal to 10²=100. So, it's a scalene, obtuse triangle maybe?

Wait, let me check if it's obtuse. Using the Law of Cosines to see the largest angle. The largest side is AC = 10, opposite angle B.

Law of Cosines: cos B = (AB² + BC² - AC²) / (2*AB*BC)
Plugging in the numbers:
cos B = (5² + 9² - 10²)/(2*5*9) = (25 + 81 - 100)/(90) = (106 - 100)/90 = 6/90 = 1/15.
So, angle B is arccos(1/15), which is acute because 1/15 is positive. So, triangle ABC is acute-angled.

But I don't know if that's immediately useful.

Now, tangents at B and C meet at D. So, D is the ex-pole with respect to BC. Wait, tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length, so DB = DC.

Wait, in triangle ABC, the tangents from D to ω are equal, so DB = DC. So, D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC. Hmm, symmedian? Or maybe the external angle bisector?

Alternatively, D is the ex-pole, so maybe it's related to the symmedian point.

Wait, perhaps using properties of harmonic division or projective geometry. Alternatively, maybe power of a point.

Power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² since DB=DC. Also, since D lies outside ω, the power is equal to DB² = DC² = DA * DP, because AD is a secant line passing through A and P.

Wait, yes, power of point D: DB² = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DB, then I can relate it to DA and DP, and since AP = AD - DP, perhaps I can find AP.

But to find DB, I might need to find the length of the tangent from D to ω, which is DB or DC.

Alternatively, maybe we can compute coordinates. Let me think about coordinate geometry.

Let me place point C at the origin, point A on the x-axis, and point B somewhere in the plane. This might make things easier.

So, let's set up a coordinate system:

- Let’s place point C at (0, 0).
- Let’s place point A at (10, 0) because AC = 10.
- Point B is somewhere in the plane; we can find its coordinates using the distances AB = 5 and BC = 9.

So, coordinates:

Point A: (10, 0)
Point C: (0, 0)
Point B: (x, y)

We know that AB = 5, so distance from A(10,0) to B(x,y) is 5:

√[(x - 10)² + (y - 0)²] = 5 → (x - 10)² + y² = 25. Equation (1)

Also, distance from B(x,y) to C(0,0) is 9:

√[x² + y²] = 9 → x² + y² = 81. Equation (2)

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

(x - 10)² + y² - (x² + y²) = 25 - 81
Expand (x - 10)²: x² - 20x + 100 + y² - x² - y² = -56
Simplify: -20x + 100 = -56 → -20x = -156 → x = (-156)/(-20) = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.

So, x = 7.8. Now, plugging back into equation (2) to find y:

x² + y² = 81 → (7.8)^2 + y^2 = 81.

7.8 squared: 7.8 * 7.8. Let's compute that.

7 * 7 = 49, 7 * 0.8 = 5.6, 0.8 * 7 = 5.6, 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64.

Wait, wait, that's (7 + 0.8)^2 = 7² + 2*7*0.8 + 0.8² = 49 + 11.2 + 0.64 = 60.84.

So, (7.8)^2 = 60.84. So,

60.84 + y² = 81 → y² = 81 - 60.84 = 20.16.

So, y = sqrt(20.16). Let me compute that.

20.16 is 20 + 0.16. sqrt(20) is about 4.472, but let's compute it exactly.

20.16 = 2016/100 = 504/25. So, sqrt(504/25) = sqrt(504)/5. Let me factor 504.

504 ÷ 16 = 31.5, no, wait, 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 ÷ 16 is 31.5? No, 16 * 31 = 496, 16*31.5=504. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, perhaps I should factor 504:

504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 ÷ 2 = 252, ÷2=126, ÷2=63, ÷3=21, ÷3=7. So, 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7.

So, sqrt(504) = sqrt(2^3 * 3^2 *7) = 2^(1.5) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 2 * sqrt(2) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 6 * sqrt(14).

Wait, let's check:

sqrt(2^3) = 2*sqrt(2), sqrt(3^2)=3, sqrt(7)=sqrt(7). So, together, 2*3*sqrt(2*7) = 6*sqrt(14). So, sqrt(504) = 6*sqrt(14).

So, y = sqrt(504)/5 = (6√14)/5 ≈ 4.4899.

So, point B has coordinates (7.8, 6√14/5). Let me write that as (39/5, 6√14/5).

So, points A(10,0), B(39/5, 6√14/5), C(0,0).

Now, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to circle ω.

First, we need to find the equation of circle ω passing through A, B, C.

We can find the circumcircle of triangle ABC. Let's find its equation.

Let me recall that the general equation of a circle is x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0.

Since points A, B, C lie on the circle, plugging in their coordinates will give us equations to solve for D, E, F.

Point C is (0,0): plugging into the circle equation:

0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 → F = 0.

So, equation becomes x² + y² + Dx + Ey = 0.

Point A is (10,0):

10² + 0² + D*10 + E*0 = 0 → 100 + 10D = 0 → 10D = -100 → D = -10.

So, equation now is x² + y² -10x + Ey = 0.

Now, plug in point B (39/5, 6√14/5):

(39/5)^2 + (6√14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6√14/5) = 0.

Compute each term:

(39/5)^2 = (1521)/(25)
(6√14/5)^2 = (36*14)/25 = 504/25
-10*(39/5) = - (390)/5 = -78
E*(6√14/5) = (6E√14)/5

So, adding them up:

1521/25 + 504/25 -78 + (6E√14)/5 = 0

Combine the fractions:

(1521 + 504)/25 = 2025/25 = 81.

So,

81 - 78 + (6E√14)/5 = 0 → 3 + (6E√14)/5 = 0 → (6E√14)/5 = -3.

Multiply both sides by 5:

6E√14 = -15 → E = (-15)/(6√14) = (-5)/(2√14).

Rationalize denominator:

E = (-5)/(2√14) * (√14/√14) = (-5√14)/(28).

So, E = (-5√14)/28.

So, the equation of the circle ω is x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y = 0.

Hmm, that seems correct.

Now, we need to find the equations of the tangents at B and C to circle ω.

First, tangent at point B: since we know the equation of the circle, the tangent at B can be found using the formula for tangent at a point (x1, y1):

xx1 + yy1 + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F = 0.

Wait, since the circle equation is x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0, the tangent at (x1,y1) is:

x x1 + y y1 + (D/2)(x + x1) + (E/2)(y + y1) + F = 0.

Alternatively, using point-slope form, but perhaps computing the slope of the tangent.

Alternatively, the tangent line at point (x1, y1) is perpendicular to the radius vector at that point. So, the slope of the radius (from center to (x1,y1)) is (y1 - k)/(x1 - h), where (h,k) is the center.

The slope of the tangent line is the negative reciprocal.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the equation of tangent at B.

Wait, circle equation: x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y = 0.

The center of the circle is at (h, k) where h = -D/2, k = -E/2.

So, D = -10, so h = -(-10)/2 = 5.

E = -5√14/28, so k = -(-5√14/28)/2 = (5√14)/56.

So, center O is at (5, 5√14/56).

Now, the tangent at point B (39/5, 6√14/5) is perpendicular to the radius OB.

The slope of OB is (6√14/5 - 5√14/56) / (39/5 - 5).

Compute numerator:

6√14/5 - 5√14/56 = (6*56√14 - 5*5√14)/(5*56) = (336√14 -25√14)/280 = (311√14)/280.

Denominator: 39/5 - 5 = 39/5 - 25/5 = 14/5.

So, slope of OB is (311√14/280) / (14/5) = (311√14/280) * (5/14) = (311√14 *5)/(280*14) ) = (1555√14)/(3920).

Simplify numerator and denominator by dividing numerator and denominator by 5:

1555 ÷5=311, 3920 ÷5=784. So, slope is (311√14)/784.

So, the slope of radius OB is (311√14)/784.

Therefore, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal, which is -784/(311√14).

Rationalize the denominator:

-784/(311√14) * (√14/√14) = -784√14/(311*14) = (-784/14) * √14/311.

784 ÷14=56. So, slope is -56√14/311.

So, the tangent at B has slope m1 = -56√14/311.

Similarly, the tangent at C (0,0) can be found.

Since point C is (0,0), the tangent at C can be found using the same method.

Slope of radius OC is (0 - k)/(0 - h) = (-k)/(-h) = k/h.

k = 5√14/56, h=5. So, slope is (5√14/56)/5 = (√14)/56.

Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is the negative reciprocal: -56/√14.

Rationalize: -56/√14 = -56√14/14 = -4√14.

So, the tangent at C has slope m2 = -4√14.

Now, equation of tangent at B:

We have point B (39/5, 6√14/5) and slope m1 = -56√14/311.

Equation: y - 6√14/5 = (-56√14/311)(x - 39/5).

Similarly, equation of tangent at C:

Point C (0,0) and slope m2 = -4√14.

Equation: y = -4√14 x.

We need to find the point D where these two tangents intersect.

So, solve the two equations:

1. y = -4√14 x.

2. y - 6√14/5 = (-56√14/311)(x - 39/5).

Substitute y from equation 1 into equation 2:

-4√14 x - 6√14/5 = (-56√14/311)(x - 39/5).

Let me factor out √14 from all terms:

√14 [ -4x - 6/5 ] = √14 [ (-56/311)(x - 39/5) ].

Divide both sides by √14:

-4x - 6/5 = (-56/311)(x - 39/5).

Multiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:

-4x *311 - (6/5)*311 = -56(x - 39/5).

Compute each term:

Left side:

-4*311 x = -1244 x

- (6/5)*311 = - (6*311)/5 = - (1866)/5.

Right side:

-56x + (56*39)/5.

So, equation becomes:

-1244x - 1866/5 = -56x + (2184)/5.

Bring all terms to left side:

-1244x +56x -1866/5 -2184/5 =0.

Simplify:

-1188x - (1866 + 2184)/5 =0.

Compute 1866 + 2184: 1866 + 2000=3866, 3866 + 184=4050. So, 4050/5=810.

Thus:

-1188x -810=0 → -1188x =810 → x= -810/1188= -810 ÷ 1188.

Simplify the fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 9: 810 ÷9=90, 1188 ÷9=132.

So, x= -90/132. Divide numerator and denominator by 6: 90 ÷6=15, 132 ÷6=22.

So, x= -15/22.

Then, from equation 1, y= -4√14 x = -4√14*(-15/22)= (60√14)/22= (30√14)/11.

So, point D has coordinates (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, we need to find point P where line AD intersects the circle ω again.

First, find the equation of line AD.

Points A(10,0) and D(-15/22, 30√14/11).

Compute the slope of AD:

m_AD = (30√14/11 - 0)/(-15/22 -10) = (30√14/11) / (-15/22 - 220/22) = (30√14/11) / (-235/22).

Simplify:

(30√14/11) * (22/-235) = (30√14 * 22)/(11*(-235)) = (30√14 * 2)/(-235) = (60√14)/(-235) = -60√14/235.

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 60 ÷5=12, 235 ÷5=47.

So, slope m_AD= -12√14/47.

Equation of line AD:

Using point A(10,0):

y -0 = m_AD (x -10) → y = (-12√14/47)(x -10).

Now, find the intersection of line AD with circle ω, which are points A and P.

We can parametrize line AD and find the other intersection point.

Alternatively, we can solve the system of equations: line AD and circle ω.

The circle equation is x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

Substitute y from line AD into the circle equation.

y = (-12√14/47)(x -10).

Let me denote s = √14 to make computations easier.

So, y = (-12s/47)(x -10).

Plug into circle equation:

x² + [ (-12s/47 (x -10) ) ]² -10x - (5s/28)(-12s/47 (x -10)) =0.

Compute each term:

First term: x².

Second term: [ (-12s/47 (x -10) ) ]² = (144 s² /47²)(x -10)^2 = (144 *14 / 2209)(x² -20x +100).

Third term: -10x.

Fourth term: - (5s/28)(-12s/47 (x -10)) = (5s/28)(12s/47)(x -10) = (60 s²)/(1316)(x -10) = (60*14)/(1316)(x -10) because s²=14.

Simplify 60*14=840. 840/1316: divide numerator and denominator by 4: 210/329.

So, fourth term: (210/329)(x -10).

So, putting it all together, equation becomes:

x² + (144*14/2209)(x² -20x +100) -10x + (210/329)(x -10) =0.

Compute constants:

144*14 = 2016, so 2016/2209.

210/329: note that 329 = 329, 210 and 329 have a common factor? 210 ÷7=30, 329 ÷7=47. So, 210=7*30, 329=7*47. So, 210/329=30/47.

So, equation simplifies to:

x² + (2016/2209)(x² -20x +100) -10x + (30/47)(x -10) =0.

Let me compute each term:

First term: x².

Second term: (2016/2209)x² - (2016*20)/2209 x + (2016*100)/2209.

Third term: -10x.

Fourth term: (30/47)x - 300/47.

Now, combine all terms:

x² + (2016/2209)x² - (40320/2209)x + 201600/2209 -10x + (30/47)x -300/47 =0.

Let me collect like terms.

First, x² terms:

1 + 2016/2209 = (2209 + 2016)/2209 = 4225/2209.

x² terms: (4225/2209) x².

x terms:

-40320/2209 x -10x +30/47 x.

Convert all to denominator 2209:

-40320/2209 x - (10x)*(2209/2209) + (30/47 x)*(47/47)*(2209/2209).

Wait, perhaps better to convert all to a common denominator.

But perhaps compute each coefficient step by step.

First, -40320/2209 x.

-10x = -10*(2209)/2209 x = -22090/2209 x.

30/47 x = 30/47*(2209)/2209 x = 30*47/2209 x = 1410/2209 x.

So, total x terms:

(-40320 -22090 +1410)/2209 x = (-40320 -22090 = -62410; -62410 +1410= -61000)/2209 x.

So, x terms: -61000/2209 x.

Constant terms:

201600/2209 -300/47.

Convert to denominator 2209:

201600/2209 - (300/47)*(47/47)*(2209/2209). Wait, perhaps:

300/47 = (300*47)/47² = 14100/2209.

Wait, no: actually, 300/47 = (300*47)/47² = 14100/2209 is incorrect.

Wait, actually, to get denominator 2209, which is 47²=2209, we can write 300/47 = (300*47)/2209 = 14100/2209.

So, 201600/2209 - 14100/2209 = (201600 -14100)/2209 = 187500/2209.

So, putting it all together:

(4225/2209)x² - (61000/2209)x + 187500/2209 =0.

Multiply both sides by 2209 to eliminate denominators:

4225x² -61000x +187500=0.

Simplify this quadratic equation.

Check if we can factor out common terms.

4225, 61000, 187500.

4225 ÷25=169, 61000 ÷25=2440, 187500 ÷25=7500.

So, divide equation by 25:

169x² -2440x +7500=0.

Now, let's solve this quadratic for x.

Quadratic equation: 169x² -2440x +7500=0.

Use quadratic formula:

x = [2440 ± sqrt(2440² -4*169*7500)]/(2*169).

Compute discriminant D:

D= 2440² -4*169*7500.

Compute 2440²:

2440 *2440.

Compute 244^2 = (200 +44)^2 = 200² + 2*200*44 +44²=40000 + 17600 + 1936=40000+17600=57600+1936=59536.

So, 2440²= (244)^2 *10^2=59536*100=5,953,600.

Compute 4*169*7500:

4*169=676, 676*7500.

Compute 676*7500:

First, 676*7000=4,732,000.

676*500=338,000.

Total: 4,732,000 +338,000=5,070,000.

So, D=5,953,600 -5,070,000=883,600.

sqrt(883,600)=sqrt(8836 *100)=sqrt(8836)*10.

Compute sqrt(8836):

Let me check 94^2=8836. Because 90^2=8100, 95^2=9025. 94^2= (90+4)^2=8100+720+16=8836.

Yes, so sqrt(8836)=94. So, sqrt(883,600)=94*10=940.

So, x=(2440 ±940)/(2*169).

Compute numerator:

2440 +940=3380.

2440 -940=1500.

So, two possibilities:

x=3380/(2*169)=3380/338=10.

x=1500/(2*169)=1500/338=750/169.

So, x=10 or x=750/169.

We know that x=10 is point A, so the other intersection point P has x=750/169.

Now, find y-coordinate of P.

Using equation of line AD: y= (-12√14/47)(x -10).

So, y= (-12√14/47)(750/169 -10).

Compute 750/169 -10=750/169 -1690/169= (750 -1690)/169= (-940)/169.

So, y= (-12√14/47)*(-940/169)= (12√14 *940)/(47*169).

Simplify:

940 ÷ 47=20, because 47*20=940.

So, numerator becomes 12√14 *20=240√14.

Denominator:169.

Thus, y=240√14 /169.

So, point P is (750/169, 240√14 /169).

Now, we need to find AP.

Point A is at (10,0), and P is at (750/169, 240√14 /169).

Compute the distance between A and P.

AP= sqrt[ (750/169 -10)^2 + (240√14 /169 -0)^2 ].

Compute 750/169 -10=750/169 -1690/169= (750 -1690)/169= (-940)/169.

So, ( -940/169 )²= (940)^2/(169)^2.

Similarly, (240√14 /169)^2= (240)^2 *14/(169)^2.

So, AP²= [940² +240² *14 ] /169².

Compute numerator:

Compute 940²: 940*940.

Let me compute 94^2=8836, so 940²=8836*100=883600.

Compute 240²=57600, 57600*14=806400.

So, numerator=883600 +806400=1,690,000.

So, AP²=1,690,000/(169)^2.

But 169=13², so 169²=13^4.

1,690,000=169 *10,000=169*10^4.

So, AP²= (169*10^4)/(169²)=10^4/169=10000/169.

Thus, AP= sqrt(10000/169)=100/13.

So, AP=100/13.

Therefore, m=100, n=13, which are coprime.

So, m +n=113.

To solve the problem, we start by placing the triangle in a coordinate system. We set point \( C \) at the origin \((0, 0)\), point \( A \) at \((10, 0)\), and find the coordinates of point \( B \) using the given side lengths. Using the distance formula and solving the system of equations, we determine \( B \) is at \((\frac{39}{5}, \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5})\).

Next, we find the equation of the circumcircle \( \omega \) passing through \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \). The center of the circle is found to be \((5, \frac{5\sqrt{14}}{56})\), and the equation of the circle is determined.

We then find the equations of the tangents at \( B \) and \( C \). The tangent at \( B \) has a slope of \(-\frac{56\sqrt{14}}{311}\), and the tangent at \( C \) has a slope of \(-4\sqrt{14}\). Solving for their intersection, we find point \( D \) at \(\left(-\frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11}\right)\).

Next, we find the equation of line \( AD \) and determine its intersection with the circumcircle \( \omega \). Solving the system of equations, we find the other intersection point \( P \) at \(\left(\frac{750}{169}, \frac{240\sqrt{14}}{169}\right)\).

Finally, we compute the length \( AP \) using the distance formula. We find \( AP = \frac{100}{13} \), where \( m = 100 \) and \( n = 13 \). Thus, \( m + n = 113 \).

\boxed{113}
