Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability. The question is asking for the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer needs to be in the form of a reduced fraction m/n, and then we have to find m + n.

Hmm, let's try to break this down. First, each vertex has two color choices, red or blue, each with a 50% chance. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That's straightforward.

Now, the problem is about rotations. A regular octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8, meaning it can be rotated by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., up to 315°, giving 8 different rotational positions. So, for a given coloring, we can rotate it 0, 45, 90, etc., and see if any of these rotations result in all blue vertices being in positions that were originally red.

Wait, but how does the rotation affect the colors? Let me think. If I rotate the octagon, each vertex moves to a new position. So, for the rotated octagon, the blue vertices must align with the original red vertices.

Let me formalize this. Let's denote the original octagon's vertices as V0, V1, V2, ..., V7. Each Vi is colored red or blue. Now, when we rotate the octagon by k positions (where k is from 0 to 7), each vertex Vi moves to position (i + k) mod 8. So, after rotation by k, the color at position j is the color of the original vertex (j - k) mod 8.

But the problem says that after rotation, all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. That means, for the rotated octagon, every blue vertex must coincide with a red vertex in the original coloring. So, for each blue vertex in the rotated octagon (which is a vertex in the original octagon shifted by k), that vertex must have been originally red.

Wait, so in other words, for a rotation by k to satisfy the condition, for every vertex in the original octagon, if it's blue after rotation, it was red before. But after rotation by k, the color at position j is the color of (j - k) mod 8. So, for all j, if color[j] is blue, then color[(j - k) mod 8] must have been red.

Wait, that sounds a bit tangled. Let me rephrase. For a given rotation k, the condition is that for every vertex j, if the color at (j - k) mod 8 is blue, then the color at j must be red. Alternatively, the set of blue vertices in the original coloring must be a subset of the set of red vertices after rotation by k. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way to think about it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that the set of blue vertices in the original must be a subset of the red vertices that are shifted by some rotation. Or maybe it's about the complement: the set of red vertices after rotation must include all the blue vertices.

Wait, no. Let's think differently. Suppose we color the octagon, and then we rotate it by some k. After rotation, all blue vertices are now where red vertices were. So, in other words, the set of blue vertices in the original must be a subset of the red vertices in the rotated octagon. But since the rotation just permutes the vertices, the set of red and blue vertices is just permuted as well. So, for some rotation k, the set B of blue vertices in the original coloring must be equal to the set R' of red vertices after rotating by k. So, B must be a subset of R' rotated by k, but since rotation is a permutation, R' is actually R shifted by k, where R is the set of red vertices in the original.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to realize that for the condition to be satisfied, the set B of blue vertices must be a subset of the set R of red vertices, but shifted by some rotation. So, for some k, B must be a subset of R shifted by k. Alternatively, R shifted by k must contain B.

Wait, but the condition is that after the rotation, all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. So, each blue vertex in the original octagon must, when rotated by k, land on a vertex that was originally red. So, for each blue vertex at position i, (i + k) mod 8 must be a red vertex.

Hmm, that's a crucial insight. So, if we have a blue vertex at i, then (i + k) mod 8 is red. So, for all blue vertices i, (i + k) mod 8 must be red. So, the color at position (i + k) mod 8 is red, given that the color at i is blue.

But how can we model this? Well, perhaps for a given coloring, we can check for each rotation k whether the condition holds. If it does, then that coloring is counted as a success.

But since we have all possible colorings, we need to count how many colorings satisfy the condition for at least one rotation k.

Wait, so the problem is counting the number of colorings where there exists a rotation k such that for every blue vertex i, (i + k) mod 8 is red. Then, the probability is that number divided by 256.

So, the total number of such colorings is the number of subsets B of the octagon's vertices such that B is a subset of R shifted by some k, where R is the complement of B (since R is the set of red vertices, and B is blue). Hmm, maybe that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, since R is the set of red vertices, and B is the set of blue vertices, R and B are complements.

So, the condition is that B is a subset of (R + k), where (R + k) is the set R shifted by k. But since R is the complement of B, (R + k) is the complement of B shifted by k.

Wait, perhaps another way: For a coloring to satisfy the condition, there must be a rotation k such that B is a subset of (R + k). But R is V \ B, so (R + k) is (V \ B) + k. So, we're looking for B such that B is a subset of (V \ B) + k for some k.

Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about the possible colorings. Since each vertex is colored independently, maybe we can model this problem using group theory or combinatorics.

Wait, perhaps we can model it by considering that for a given rotation k, the condition is that B is contained within (V \ B) shifted by k. So, for each k, the number of colorings where B is a subset of (V \ B) + k is equal to the number of colorings where each vertex in B is such that (i + k) is in V \ B.

Alternatively, for each k, the number of colorings where for all i in B, (i + k) is not in B. Because if (i + k) is in V \ B, then it's red.

Wait, that might be a way to think about it. For a fixed k, the condition is that B is a subset of (V \ B) shifted by k, which is equivalent to B being a subset of (V \ B) + k. But since (V \ B) + k is just the set of all (j + k) mod 8 for j not in B.

Alternatively, for each i in B, (i + k) mod 8 must not be in B. So, for each i in B, (i + k) mod 8 is in (V \ B). So, that means that for a fixed k, the condition is that B is a subset of the set (V \ B) shifted by k.

But since (V \ B) shifted by k is just the set { (j + k) mod 8 | j not in B }, which is the same as (V \ B) + k.

Wait, so for each k, the condition is that B is a subset of (V \ B) + k. Which would mean that for each i in B, i is in (V \ B) + k. So, i - k is in (V \ B). Or, (i - k) mod 8 is not in B.

Wait, that's another way to see it. So, for a given k, the condition is that for all i in B, (i - k) mod 8 is not in B. So, B cannot contain any element that is k positions before another element in B.

So, that's an interesting property. So, for each k, the number of colorings where B satisfies that for all i in B, (i - k) mod 8 is not in B. Hmm, that's a form of a restriction on B.

But since the problem is asking for the probability that such a k exists, we need to count all colorings where for at least one k, this condition holds.

Hmm, this seems related to the concept of a "fixed-free" set under rotation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this problem using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Since we're looking for colorings that satisfy the condition for at least one rotation, we can consider each rotation and the colorings that satisfy it, then subtract overlaps, etc.

But inclusion-exclusion can get complicated because the rotations are not independent; rotating by k and rotating by l can have overlapping conditions.

Wait, maybe another approach: For each coloring, it either satisfies the condition for some rotation or not. So, we can model this as the union over all k of the sets S_k, where S_k is the set of colorings where rotating by k makes all blue vertices land on red ones.

Then, the total number we're looking for is |S_0 ∪ S_1 ∪ ... ∪ S_7|.

By the inclusion-exclusion principle, this is equal to the sum of |S_k| minus the sum of |S_k ∩ S_l| plus the sum of |S_k ∩ S_l ∩ S_m|, and so on.

But this seems complicated because the rotations can interfere with each other. For example, a coloring that's fixed under rotation by both k and l would be counted in both S_k and S_l, and so on.

But maybe let's first compute |S_k| for a single k. What is |S_k|?

For a fixed k, S_k consists of all colorings where for every i in B, (i + k) mod 8 is not in B. Because when we rotate by k, the blue vertex at i must land on a red vertex at (i + k) mod 8, which implies that (i + k) is not blue.

So, for each k, |S_k| is the number of subsets B of V such that B and B + k are disjoint. Because B + k is the set {i + k mod 8 | i in B}. So, B and B + k are disjoint.

Therefore, for each k, the number of subsets B where B ∩ (B + k) = empty set.

So, how do we count the number of such subsets B?

This is a classic problem in combinatorics. For each k, the number of subsets B such that B and B + k are disjoint is equal to 2^m, where m is the number of orbits under the rotation by k. Wait, maybe not exactly, but let's think.

Wait, when you have a shift by k, and you want subsets B such that B and B + k are disjoint, this is equivalent to a binary necklace problem where the coloring must have no two beads of the same color at distance k apart.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to model this as a graph where each vertex is connected to the one k positions away, and then the subsets B must be independent sets in this graph.

Alternatively, since the octagon is a cycle, shifting by k can create cycles in the graph. For example, if k and 8 are coprime, the shift generates a single cycle of length 8. If k and 8 are not coprime, then the shift generates multiple cycles.

Wait, yes, in graph theory, the shift by k in an 8-node cycle graph creates cycles whose length is equal to the order of k modulo 8. The number of cycles is gcd(k, 8).

So, for each k, the graph consists of gcd(k,8) cycles, each of length 8/gcd(k,8).

So, for example, if k=1, gcd(1,8)=1, so the graph is a single cycle of length 8. Then, the number of subsets B where B and B + k are disjoint is equal to the number of independent sets on that cycle graph.

Wait, but for a cycle graph with n nodes, the number of independent sets is known to satisfy a certain recurrence relation. For a cycle of length m, the number of independent sets is F(m) + F(m-2), where F is the Fibonacci sequence? Wait, perhaps I should recall the exact formula.

No, actually, for a path graph of length n, the number of independent sets is F(n+2), where F is the Fibonacci sequence. For a cycle graph, it's a bit different because the first and last nodes are connected.

Wait, the number of independent sets on a cycle graph C_m is equal to F(m) + F(m-2). Wait, let me check for small m.

For m=3, the cycle graph is a triangle. The independent sets are: empty set, each single vertex. So, 4 independent sets. On the other hand, F(3)=2, F(1)=1. So, 2 +1=3, which doesn't match. Hmm, maybe my memory is off.

Wait, maybe it's F(m-1) + F(m+1). For m=3: F(2)=1, F(4)=3. 1+3=4. That works. Let me check m=4: cycle graph with 4 nodes. Independent sets: empty, single nodes, two opposite nodes. So, 1 +4 +2=7. F(3)=2, F(5)=5. 2 +5=7. That works. So, yes, for a cycle of length m, the number of independent sets is F(m-1) + F(m+1), where F is the Fibonacci sequence with F(0)=0, F(1)=1, etc.

Wait, but actually, the number of independent sets on C_m is F_{m-1} + F_{m+1}. So, for m=3, that's F_2 + F_4 = 1 + 3 =4, which matches. For m=4, F_3 + F_5 = 2 +5=7. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Wait, perhaps it's F_{m} + F_{m-2}. For m=3: F_3=2 + F_1=1, so 3. Doesn't match. So, perhaps my initial thought was wrong. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the number of independent sets for small m.

For m=1: only one node. Independent sets: 2 (empty and the node itself). So, 2.

For m=2: two nodes connected. Independent sets: 3 (empty, first node, second node).

For m=3: triangle. Independent sets: 4 (empty, each single node). So, 4.

For m=4: cycle of 4. Independent sets: empty, each single node, and the two pairs of opposite nodes. So, 1 +4 +2 =7.

For m=5: cycle of 5. The independent sets can be calculated using the formula for cycles: i(m) = i(m-1) + i(m-2) - i(m-3), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can look up the number of independent sets on a cycle graph.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula that for a cycle graph C_n, the number of independent sets is F_{n-1} + F_{n+1}.

Wait, for n=3: F_2 + F_4=1 +3=4. Correct.

n=4: F_3 + F_5=2 +5=7. Correct.

n=5: F_4 + F_6=3 +8=11. Let's check: for a cycle of 5 nodes, the number of independent sets. Empty set (1), 5 single nodes (5), 5 sets of two non-adjacent nodes (each node can pair with the node two away, but in a 5-node cycle, each node has two non-adjacent nodes, but selecting two non-adjacent nodes gives 5 possibilities, but wait, actually in a 5-node cycle, the number of independent sets of size 2 is 5, because each node can pair with the node two positions away, and there are 5 such pairs. Then, independent sets of size 3: in a 5-node cycle, you can't have three independent nodes because every third node is adjacent to the first. So, only size 0,1,2. So total is 1 +5 +5=11. Which matches F_4 + F_6=3 +8=11. So, the formula holds.

So, for a cycle of length m, the number of independent sets is F_{m-1} + F_{m+1}.

Therefore, returning to our problem, for each k, the shift by k partitions the octagon into gcd(k,8) cycles, each of length 8 / gcd(k,8).

So, for each such cycle, the number of independent sets is F_{m-1} + F_{m+1}, where m is the length of the cycle.

Thus, for each k, |S_k| is equal to the product over each cycle of the number of independent sets on that cycle. Since the cycles are independent, the total number is the product.

Therefore, for each k, |S_k| is the product over each cycle of (F_{m-1} + F_{m+1}), where m is the length of each cycle.

But let's compute this for each possible k.

First, note that k can be 0 to 7. But since rotation by 0 is the identity, S_0 is the set of all colorings where B is a subset of (V \ B). Which is only possible if B is empty, because if B is non-empty, then for some i in B, (i +0) mod8 is in B, which would violate the condition. So, S_0 only contains the all-red coloring, where B is empty. So, |S_0|=1.

Now, for k=1,2,3,4,5,6,7, we need to compute |S_k|.

But let's note that for each k, the value of |S_k| depends only on gcd(k,8). So, we can group the k's by their gcd with 8.

The possible values of gcd(k,8) are the divisors of 8: 1,2,4,8. But since k is less than 8, gcd(k,8) can be 1,2,4.

So, let's compute |S_k| for each case:

Case 1: gcd(k,8)=1. So, k=1,3,5,7.

In this case, the shift by k generates a single cycle of length 8. So, the number of independent sets is F_{8-1} + F_{8+1}=F_7 + F_9.

F_7 is 13, F_9 is 34. So, 13 +34=47.

Wait, hold on, the Fibonacci sequence is typically defined as F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, F_7=13, F_8=21, F_9=34.

So, yes, F_7=13, F_9=34. So, 13 +34=47.

Therefore, |S_k|=47 for each k with gcd(k,8)=1.

Case 2: gcd(k,8)=2. So, k=2,6.

Here, the shift by k partitions the octagon into 2 cycles, each of length 4. So, each cycle is a 4-node cycle.

For each 4-node cycle, the number of independent sets is F_{4-1} + F_{4+1}=F_3 + F_5=2 +5=7.

Since there are two independent cycles, the total number of independent sets is 7 *7=49.

Therefore, |S_k|=49 for each k with gcd(k,8)=2.

Case 3: gcd(k,8)=4. So, k=4.

Here, the shift by k partitions the octagon into 4 cycles, each of length 2. Each cycle is a 2-node edge.

For each 2-node cycle, the number of independent sets is F_{2-1} + F_{2+1}=F_1 + F_3=1 +2=3.

Since there are four such cycles, the total number is 3^4=81.

Therefore, |S_k|=81 for k=4.

So, summarizing:

- For k=0: |S_0|=1 (only the all-red coloring).
- For k=1,3,5,7 (gcd=1): |S_k|=47 each.
- For k=2,6 (gcd=2): |S_k|=49 each.
- For k=4 (gcd=4): |S_k|=81.

Now, the inclusion-exclusion principle says that the total number of colorings where at least one S_k holds is:

|S_0 ∪ S_1 ∪ ... ∪ S_7| = Σ|S_k| - Σ|S_k ∩ S_l| + Σ|S_k ∩ S_l ∩ S_m| - ... + (-1)^{n+1}|S_0 ∩ S_1 ∩ ... ∩ S_7}|.

But this seems quite complicated because the intersections can be messy.

Wait, but perhaps the colorings that are in multiple S_k sets have some special structure. Maybe the only colorings that are in all S_k are the all-red and all-blue colorings? Or maybe only the all-red coloring.

Wait, because the only coloring that is in every S_k is the all-red coloring, because for any non-empty B, there exists a rotation k such that B +k overlaps with B. So, the all-blue coloring is not in any S_k, except perhaps if k=0? Wait, no, because for k=0, the condition is that B is a subset of (V \ B), which only holds if B is empty.

Wait, all-red coloring (B=empty set) is in every S_k, because for any k, the condition is trivially satisfied (there are no blue vertices, so the condition holds). So, |S_0 ∩ S_1 ∩ ... ∩ S_7|=1.

Similarly, the all-blue coloring (B=V) is not in any S_k, because for any k, rotating by k would require that every vertex (i +k) mod8 is red, but since B=V, all vertices are blue, so this is impossible.

So, the only common element across all S_k is the all-red coloring.

Now, considering that, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion formula is manageable.

But wait, the problem is that the S_k sets are not independent; their intersections can vary. So, for example, S_1 and S_2 may have some colorings in common, which are colorings that satisfy both the condition for k=1 and for k=2.

But computing all pairwise intersections, triple intersections, etc., is going to be complicated. There might be a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the problem using Burnside's lemma or something from group theory, considering the group of rotations.

Wait, Burnside's lemma counts the number of orbits, but here we're dealing with colorings that satisfy a condition for some rotation. So, maybe using Burnside's lemma isn't directly applicable, but perhaps the inclusion-exclusion approach is still the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that for a coloring to be counted, it must be such that there exists a rotation k where B is an independent set for the graph where edges connect each vertex i to i +k.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps another angle: The condition is that B is a subset of R +k, where R is the set of red vertices. Since R is V \ B, this implies that B is a subset of (V \ B) +k.

Which is equivalent to B ∩ (B +k) = empty set.

So, for each k, the number of colorings where B is an independent set under the shift by k is |S_k|, which we have already calculated.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of colorings where B is independent under at least one shift k.

So, the union of all S_k.

But to compute the size of the union, we can use inclusion-exclusion.

So, the formula is:

|S_0 ∪ S_1 ∪ ... ∪ S_7| = Σ|S_k| - Σ|S_k ∩ S_l| + Σ|S_k ∩ S_l ∩ S_m| - ... + (-1)^{n+1}|S_0 ∩ S_1 ∩ ... ∩ S_7}|.

But calculating this is going to be tedious because we have to consider all possible intersections.

But perhaps we can find the number of colorings that are in exactly m of the S_k sets and use inclusion-exclusion accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps the only colorings that are in multiple S_k are those that are fixed under multiple rotations, but this might not be the case.

Wait, perhaps we can think in terms of the stabilizer of the coloring under rotation. A coloring is in S_k if it is fixed under rotation by k in some way.

Wait, but maybe it's better to consider that a coloring is in multiple S_k's if it is an independent set under multiple shifts.

Wait, for example, a coloring that is independent under shifts k1 and k2 must satisfy that for all i in B, (i +k1) mod8 not in B, and (i +k2) mod8 not in B.

So, such a coloring must be an independent set under both shifts k1 and k2.

But in graph theory terms, this would correspond to an independent set in the intersection graph of the two shift graphs.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the only colorings that are in multiple S_k sets are the all-red coloring and colorings with certain symmetries.

Wait, for example, the all-red coloring is in all S_k. Are there other colorings that are in multiple S_k?

Suppose a coloring is such that B is empty (all red). Then it's in every S_k.

Another example: Suppose B is a single vertex. Then, for which k is B in S_k?

For B = {i}, S_k requires that (i +k) is not in B. But since B has only i, (i +k) must not be i. So, k cannot be 0 mod8. So, for k=1,2,...,7, the condition is satisfied. So, this coloring is in S_k for all k except k=0.

Wait, but earlier we saw that S_0 only contains the all-red coloring. So, for B={i}, it's in S_k for all k except 0.

Wait, but in our initial analysis, for k=0, S_0 only includes the all-red coloring, which is B=empty. So, for B={i}, S_0 would require that B is a subset of (V \ B) shifted by 0, which is (V \ B). So, B is a subset of (V \ B), which is only possible if B is empty. So, B={i} is not in S_0.

So, for B={i}, the coloring is in S_k for all k≠0. So, it's in 7 S_k sets.

Similarly, a two-element B: let's say B={i, j}. For which k is B in S_k?

It requires that for all b in B, (b +k) is not in B. So, (i +k) not in B and (j +k) not in B.

So, for such a B, there might be some k where this is true.

But perhaps it's getting too complex.

Wait, perhaps I should try to compute the inclusion-exclusion terms. Let's see:

First, the first term in inclusion-exclusion is the sum of |S_k| for k=0 to7.

Which is |S_0| + 4*|S_k|_gcd1 + 2*|S_k|_gcd2 +1*|S_k|_gcd4.

So, that's 1 + 4*47 + 2*49 +1*81.

Compute that: 1 + 4*47=1 +188=189, plus 2*49=98, so 189 +98=287, plus 81 gives 368.

So, the first term is 368.

The second term is the sum over all pairs (k,l) of |S_k ∩ S_l|.

So, we need to find for each pair (k,l), the number of colorings that are in both S_k and S_l, i.e., colorings where B is a subset of (V \ B) +k and also a subset of (V \ B) + l.

Which is equivalent to B ∩ (B +k) = empty and B ∩ (B +l) = empty.

So, the intersection S_k ∩ S_l is the set of colorings where B is independent under both shifts k and l.

So, to compute |S_k ∩ S_l|, we need to find the number of subsets B such that B ∩ (B +k) = empty and B ∩ (B +l)=empty.

But this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that for two rotations k and l, the intersection S_k ∩ S_l corresponds to the colorings where B is an independent set under both shifts k and l.

In graph theory terms, this is the intersection of two independent sets graphs, and the resulting graph's independent sets are those that are independent under both shifts.

But perhaps it's better to model this as a graph where edges are added if two nodes are k apart or l apart.

But this seems too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps we can note that the number of colorings in S_k ∩ S_l is equal to the number of colorings where B is an independent set under both shifts k and l.

Which is equivalent to the number of colorings where B is an independent set in the union graph of the two shift graphs.

But this is getting too abstract.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find that for some pairs (k,l), the condition S_k ∩ S_l is only the all-red coloring.

Wait, for example, suppose k and l are such that their shifts generate the entire group. For example, if k=1 and l=2, then their shifts generate all possible rotations, so the only coloring that is in both S_1 and S_2 is the all-red coloring.

Wait, is that true?

Wait, let's take k=1 and l=2.

Suppose a coloring is in both S_1 and S_2.

So, for S_1: for all i in B, (i +1) mod8 is not in B.

For S_2: for all i in B, (i +2) mod8 is not in B.

So, the coloring must satisfy both conditions.

Is the only such coloring the all-red coloring?

Let me see.

Suppose B is non-empty. Let's take a single element B={i}.

Then, condition for S_1: (i +1) not in B. Since B has only i, this is satisfied.

Condition for S_2: (i +2) not in B. Also satisfied.

So, B={i} is in both S_1 and S_2. So, the coloring isn't necessarily all-red. So, my previous assumption was wrong.

So, the intersection S_1 ∩ S_2 includes more colorings than just all-red.

Hmm, so we need a better approach.

Wait, perhaps the number of colorings in S_k ∩ S_l depends on the greatest common divisor of k and l.

Let me think: If d = gcd(k, l), then the shifts can be thought of as generating a subgroup of the rotation group with order d.

Wait, maybe the number of colorings in S_k ∩ S_l is equal to the product over each cycle in the graph generated by the subgroup generated by k and l of the number of independent sets on each cycle.

But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps for each divisor d of 8, the number of colorings fixed by all shifts with order dividing d is something we can compute.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the lattice of subgroups and use Möbius inversion, but that's probably beyond my current level.

Alternatively, perhaps we can note that the problem is symmetric for all k, so perhaps the intersections |S_k ∩ S_l| can be categorized based on the relationship between k and l.

Specifically, for two rotations k and l, the intersection S_k ∩ S_l depends on the subgroup generated by k and l.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that the problem is asking for the number of colorings where there exists a rotation k such that B is a subset of (V \ B) +k.

But since the group is abelian, perhaps we can use the principle from combinatorics called the "Union of Cosets" or something similar.

Wait, perhaps this problem is similar to counting the number of subsets B such that B is contained in some translate of its complement.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can note that the condition is equivalent to B being a subset of (V \ B) +k for some k. Which is equivalent to B +k being a subset of V \ B.

Thus, B +k is a subset of V \ B, which is equivalent to (B +k) ∩ B = empty.

So, for some k, (B +k) ∩ B = empty.

Which is the same as saying that B is a "shifted" independent set.

Wait, perhaps another thought: For each coloring, the set B must be such that there exists a k where B is a subset of V \ (B +k).

Which is equivalent to B ∩ (B +k) = empty.

So, for some k, B and B +k are disjoint.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets B where B and B +k are disjoint for some k.

Hmm, this seems similar to a covering condition.

Wait, but how can we count the number of such subsets?

An alternative approach is to consider that for each B, the minimal shift k where B and B +k are disjoint can be determined, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the probability that no such k exists and subtract it from 1.

So, the probability that for all k, B and B +k are not disjoint.

Which is the same as saying that for every k, there exists some i such that i in B and (i +k) mod8 in B.

Which is equivalent to saying that B is a "k-dense" set for all k.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think of this as for every rotation k, B intersects B +k.

Which would imply that the set B is a blocking set for all shifts.

But I'm not familiar with the exact terminology.

Alternatively, perhaps it's equivalent to B being a "fixing set" for the group action.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the total number of colorings where for every k, B and B +k are not disjoint.

So, the complement of our desired set.

Let me denote this complement as C. So, |C| is the number of colorings where for every k, B and B +k are not disjoint.

Our desired count is 256 - |C|.

So, if we can compute |C|, we can find the answer.

So, how to compute |C|?

|C| is the number of subsets B such that for every k, B ∩ (B +k) ≠ empty.

So, B is such that for every shift k, B and B +k share at least one vertex.

This is equivalent to saying that B is a "covering" for the group Z_8 under addition.

Wait, more precisely, B is a covering code where every shift of B intersects B.

Alternatively, B is a code with covering radius 0 in some sense.

Wait, another thought: The condition that for every k, B ∩ (B +k) ≠ empty is equivalent to B +k not being a subset of V \ B for any k.

Wait, but that's not exactly the same.

Wait, no, because V \ B is the complement of B. So, B +k not being a subset of V \ B is equivalent to B ∩ (B +k) ≠ empty.

So, yes, that's correct.

So, |C| is the number of subsets B where for every k, B ∩ (B +k) ≠ empty.

So, how can we count such subsets?

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach: For each coloring, the condition is that the coloring is such that there's no rotation k where all blue vertices are mapped to red ones.

Which is equivalent to saying that for every rotation k, there's at least one blue vertex that maps to a blue vertex. So, in other words, for every k, the set B is not a subset of (V \ B) +k.

But this is similar to saying that B is not a shift of its complement.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a constraint satisfaction problem.

But perhaps I need a different approach.

Wait, another idea: The condition is that for all k, there exists some i such that i is in B and (i +k) is also in B.

Which can be rewritten as, for all k, there exists some i such that i -k is in B.

Which is equivalent to, for all k, (B -k) ∩ B ≠ empty.

Wait, but that's another way to look at it.

But perhaps it's better to think about the difference set.

Wait, the difference set of B is the set of all differences i - j mod8 for i,j in B.

The condition that for every k, there's some i such that i -k is in B is equivalent to the difference set covering all k.

So, the difference set of B must be the entire group Z_8.

So, |C| is the number of subsets B whose difference set is Z_8.

Hmm, this is a known concept in additive combinatorics.

The difference set of a subset B of Z_8 is the set {b - b' mod8 | b, b' in B}.

If the difference set is Z_8, then for every k in Z_8, there exist b, b' in B such that k = b - b'.

So, such subsets B are called "complete difference sets" or "perfect difference sets."

In Z_8, a perfect difference set is a subset B such that every non-zero element of Z_8 can be expressed as a difference of two elements in B.

Wait, but in our case, the difference set needs to cover all elements of Z_8, including 0.

But in additive combinatorics, a perfect difference set typically covers all non-zero elements.

Hmm, but in our problem, the condition is that for every k, there exists some i in B such that (i +k) mod8 is also in B. Which is equivalent to saying that k = j - i mod8 for some i, j in B.

So, the difference set must cover all k in Z_8.

So, the difference set must be Z_8.

Thus, |C| is the number of subsets B of Z_8 whose difference set is Z_8.

So, how many such subsets are there?

Well, in Z_8, a subset B is a perfect difference set (covering all elements) if and only if it is a complete set of residues.

Wait, but in Z_8, the size of B must satisfy certain conditions.

Wait, in additive number theory, a perfect difference set in Z_m exists only for certain m. For example, in Z_p where p is prime, a perfect difference set exists with size (p+1)/2.

But Z_8 is not a field, it's a ring.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for known results.

Wait, I recall that in Z_8, the only perfect difference sets are those of size 4, such as the set {0,1,3,4}, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me check for B of size 4.

Let's take B = {0,1,3,4}. Let's compute its difference set.

Compute all differences a - b mod8 for a, b in B.

Compute all a - b:

0-0=0

0-1=7

0-3=5

0-4=4

1-0=1

1-1=0

1-3=6

1-4=5

3-0=3

3-1=2

3-3=0

3-4=7

4-0=4

4-1=3

4-3=1

4-4=0

So, the differences are: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. So, the difference set is indeed Z_8.

So, B = {0,1,3,4} is a perfect difference set.

Similarly, any translate of this set is also a perfect difference set.

So, the number of such subsets would be 8 (for each translate) times the number of such sets.

But wait, {0,1,3,4} can be shifted by any element of Z_8, giving 8 different sets.

But are these the only perfect difference sets of size 4?

Wait, let me check another set. Let's try B={0,2,3,5}.

Compute differences:

0-0=0

0-2=6

0-3=5

0-5=3

2-0=2

2-2=0

2-3=7

2-5=5

3-0=3

3-2=1

3-3=0

3-5=6

5-0=5

5-2=3

5-3=2

5-5=0

So, the differences are 0,1,2,3,5,6,7. Missing 4. So, not a perfect difference set.

So, not all subsets of size 4 are perfect difference sets.

Thus, the only perfect difference sets in Z_8 are the translates of {0,1,3,4}.

Wait, are there any other perfect difference sets?

Wait, another example: B={0,1,4,5}.

Compute differences:

0-0=0

0-1=7

0-4=4

0-5=3

1-0=1

1-1=0

1-4=5

1-5=4

4-0=4

4-1=3

4-4=0

4-5=7

5-0=5

5-1=4

5-4=1

5-5=0

Differences: 0,1,3,4,5,7. Missing 2,6. Not perfect.

So, seems like the only perfect difference sets are the translates of {0,1,3,4}.

So, how many such subsets are there? Each is a translate of {0,1,3,4}, so there are 8 such subsets (for each shift k, {k, k+1, k+3, k+4} mod8).

So, the number of perfect difference sets is 8.

Additionally, what about the empty set and the full set?

Wait, the empty set: its difference set is empty, so it's not perfect.

The full set: the difference set is all of Z_8, since any element can be obtained as a - b.

So, the full set is also a perfect difference set.

Similarly, the empty set is not, but the full set is.

Wait, let me verify:

If B = Z_8, then the difference set is {a - b | a, b in Z_8} = Z_8, since for any k, take a = k + b for some b. So yes, B=Z_8 is a perfect difference set.

Similarly, B=empty set: difference set is empty.

So, in addition to the 8 translates of {0,1,3,4}, we have the full set as another perfect difference set.

Wait, but let me check: are there any other subsets besides these 8 translates and the full set that are perfect difference sets?

Let me check B of size 5.

Take B = {0,1,2,3,4}.

Compute differences:

0-0=0

0-1=7

0-2=6

0-3=5

0-4=4

1-0=1

1-1=0

1-2=7

1-3=6

1-4=5

2-0=2

2-1=1

2-2=0

2-3=7

2-4=6

3-0=3

3-1=2

3-2=1

3-3=0

3-4=7

4-0=4

4-1=3

4-2=2

4-3=1

4-4=0

Differences: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. So, it's a perfect difference set.

So, B of size 5 can also form a perfect difference set.

Wait, so in addition to the 8 translates of {0,1,3,4}, and the full set, we also have subsets of size 5 that are perfect difference sets.

Wait, how many such subsets are there?

For example, B={0,1,2,3,4} is a perfect difference set.

Similarly, its translates would be {k, k+1, k+2, k+3, k+4} for each k.

Each such translate is a perfect difference set. How many are there? 8, one for each k.

But wait, let's compute for B={0,1,2,3,4}, its translates would be {k, k+1, k+2, k+3, k+4}.

So, for each k, we get a different set, but note that when k=0, B is {0,1,2,3,4}; when k=1, it's {1,2,3,4,5}, etc., up to k=7, which is {7,0,1,2,3}.

Each of these is a perfect difference set.

So, we have 8 such subsets of size 5.

Similarly, the full set is another perfect difference set.

So, in total, the perfect difference sets in Z_8 are:

- The 8 translates of {0,1,3,4} (size 4).

- The 8 translates of {0,1,2,3,4} (size 5).

- The full set Z_8 (size 8).

Wait, but let me verify if these are the only ones.

Is there a perfect difference set of size 2 or 3?

Take B of size 2: {0,1}.

Compute differences: 0,1,7.

So, missing 2,3,4,5,6.

Not perfect.

Similarly, B of size 3: {0,1,2}.

Differences: 0,1,2,7,6,5.

Missing 3,4.

Not perfect.

So, no perfect difference sets of size 2 or 3.

Similarly, size 4: only the translates of {0,1,3,4}.

Size 5: only the translates of {0,1,2,3,4}.

Size 8: the full set.

So, in total, the number of perfect difference sets is 8 (size 4) + 8 (size 5) +1 (size 8) =17.

Wait, but wait. The full set is Z_8, which is a perfect difference set.

The 8 translates of size 4.

The 8 translates of size 5.

So, total is 8 +8 +1=17.

But wait, let's check if the translates of size 5 are indeed distinct from the translates of size 4.

Yes, since 4≠5, they are different subsets.

Similarly, the full set is unique.

So, |C|=17.

Wait, but wait. Each perfect difference set corresponds to a unique subset B.

But wait, when we take translates of size 4: {0,1,3,4}, {1,2,4,5}, etc., each is a distinct subset.

Similarly, translates of size 5: {0,1,2,3,4}, {1,2,3,4,5}, etc.

And then the full set.

So, in total, 8 +8 +1=17.

So, |C|=17?

Wait, but that seems low. Because earlier, we considered that the all-red coloring is in every S_k, so it's in the union. So, the complement C should be the set of colorings where no rotation k satisfies the condition, which is the set of colorings where for every k, B and B +k are not disjoint.

Which is equivalent to B being a perfect difference set.

So, the number of such colorings is 17, as we have 17 perfect difference sets.

But wait, each perfect difference set corresponds to a unique coloring, where B is the set of blue vertices.

So, |C|=17.

But wait, hold on. The all-blue coloring is B=V, which is also a perfect difference set, as its difference set is Z_8.

So, it is included in C.

So, |C|=17.

Therefore, the number of colorings where there exists a rotation k such that B is a subset of (V \ B) +k is equal to the total colorings minus |C|.

Which is 256 -17=239.

Wait, but earlier, when we considered |S_0|, we saw that S_0 only contains the all-red coloring, which is B=empty set. So, the all-red coloring is in the union S_0 ∪ ... ∪ S_7, and is not in C.

But according to our calculation, |C|=17. So, the union is 256 -17=239.

But wait, let me think again.

Because C is the set of colorings where for every k, B and B +k are not disjoint, i.e., B is a perfect difference set. So, each such B corresponds to a coloring, and there are 17 such colorings.

Therefore, the number of colorings where there exists a k such that B is a subset of (V \ B) +k is 256 -17=239.

So, the probability is 239 /256.

But wait, 239 is a prime number. 256=2^8. So, 239 and 256 are coprime, since 239 is odd.

Therefore, m=239, n=256, so m +n=239+256=495.

Wait, but that seems inconsistent with the initial inclusion-exclusion approach where the first term was 368.

But according to this, the answer is 239/256.

But wait, let me check: if |C|=17, then the number of colorings that are in at least one S_k is 256 -17=239.

But when we computed the first term in inclusion-exclusion, it was 368, which is greater than 256. So, clearly, the inclusion-exclusion approach was wrong because the union cannot exceed 256.

Wait, that suggests that my earlier approach using inclusion-exclusion was flawed.

But the alternative approach where |C|=17 seems more plausible because it correctly leads to the total colorings being 256, and the union being 239.

So, perhaps the correct answer is 239/256, giving m +n=239+256=495.

But I need to confirm.

Wait, another way to see: if the number of colorings where there exists a rotation k such that all blue vertices are mapped to red ones is 239, then the probability is 239/256.

But is that correct?

Wait, let's think about the all-red coloring: it is included in S_0, and it's counted as a valid coloring.

The all-blue coloring is not included in any S_k, so it's in C.

Similarly, the 16 other perfect difference sets correspond to colorings where B is a perfect difference set, which are 17 colorings, including all-blue.

So, the number of colorings where there exists a rotation k is 256 -17=239.

Therefore, the probability is 239/256.

So, the answer is 239 +256=495.

But wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in the inclusion-exclusion approach. Because the inclusion-exclusion was adding up |S_k|, which for k=0 is 1, and for others 47,49,81.

But 1 +4*47=189, 2*49=98, 1*81=81. 189+98=287 +81=368.

But 368 is greater than 256, which is impossible because the union cannot have more elements than the total.

Therefore, the inclusion-exclusion approach must have been incorrect.

Therefore, the alternative approach where |C|=17 is more plausible.

Thus, the probability is 239/256, leading to m +n=495.


--- Final Answer Content ---


Now, let's provide the step-by-step explanation.

The problem involves a regular octagon where each vertex is independently colored red or blue with equal probability. We need to find the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices align with originally red vertices.

1. **Total Colorings**: Each vertex can be colored in 2 ways, so there are \(2^8 = 256\) total colorings.

2. **Perfect Difference Sets**: A subset \(B\) of vertices is a perfect difference set if every element of \( \mathbb{Z}_8 \) can be expressed as a difference of two elements in \(B\). These sets satisfy that for every rotation \(k\), \(B\) and \(B + k\) are not disjoint, meaning no rotation can make all blue vertices align with red ones.

3. **Counting Perfect Difference Sets**:
   - Size 4: The translates of \(\{0,1,3,4\}\) yield 8 perfect difference sets.
   - Size 5: The translates of \(\{0,1,2,3,4\}\) yield another 8 perfect difference sets.
   - Size 8: The full set \(\mathbb{Z}_8\) is also a perfect difference set.
   - Total: \(8 + 8 + 1 = 17\) perfect difference sets.

4. **Colorings in \(C\)**: These are colorings where \(B\) is a perfect difference set. Hence, there are 17 such colorings.

5. **Desired Colorings**: The colorings where there exists a rotation \(k\) such that all blue vertices align with red ones are \(256 - 17 = 239\).

6. **Probability**: The probability is \( \frac{239}{256} \), where 239 and 256 are coprime.

7. **Final Answer**: \(m + n = 239 + 256 = 495\).

**Answer**: \(\boxed{495}\)
