Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking. It involves a triangle ABC with a circumcenter O and an incenter I. They tell me that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product of AB and AC, which is AB·AC.

Hmm, let's recall some concepts. The circumcenter O is the center of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the incenter I is the center of the inscribed circle. The circumradius is the radius of the circumcircle, and the inradius is the radius of the incircle.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, that's an interesting condition. Maybe I can use some properties or formulas related to triangle centers and their distances.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be given by the formula:
OI² = R(R - 2r)
where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me verify if that's correct.

Wait, is that correct? I think it is. Yes, OI² = R² - 2Rr. So plugging in the given values, R is 13 and r is 6, so OI² = 13² - 2*13*6. Let me calculate that.

13 squared is 169. 2*13*6 is 156. So OI² = 169 - 156 = 13. Therefore, OI is sqrt(13).

But we also know that IA is perpendicular to OI. So triangle OIA is a right triangle, with right angle at I. So, by the Pythagorean theorem, OA² = OI² + IA².

Wait, OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So OA² is 169. OI² is 13, so IA² must be OA² - OI² = 169 -13=156. Therefore, IA is sqrt(156). Let's see, sqrt(156) simplifies to sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). So IA is 2√39.

But IA is the length from the inradius to vertex A? No, wait. IA is the length from the incenter I to vertex A. Wait, isn't IA the length of the inradius? No, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side, not to the vertex. So IA is the distance from I to A, which is not the inradius itself.

Wait, so I have IA = 2√39. Hmm.

I need to relate IA to other properties of the triangle. I recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and angles. Let me think about that.

Yes, the formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A is:
IA = \frac{r}{\sin \frac{A}{2}}
where r is the inradius, and A is the angle at vertex A.

So, IA = r / sin(A/2). I can write that down.

We have IA = 2√39 and r = 6, so:

2√39 = 6 / sin(A/2)

Let me solve for sin(A/2):

sin(A/2) = 6 / (2√39) = 3 / √39 = 3√39 / 39 = √39 / 13.

Wait, because rationalizing the denominator: 3/√39 = (3√39)/39 = √39/13.

So, sin(A/2) = √39 / 13.

Hmm, okay. Now, maybe I can find cos(A/2) using the Pythagorean identity. Since sin²θ + cos²θ = 1.

So, cos²(A/2) = 1 - sin²(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169. So cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

Wait, cos(A/2) is positive because A is an acute angle in a triangle, so it must be less than 90 degrees, making A/2 less than 45 degrees. So, cos(A/2) is positive.

So, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

Hmm, not sure if that helps yet, but let's keep that in mind.

I need to find AB·AC. Let's denote AB as c, AC as b, and BC as a, following the standard notation where a is opposite angle A, etc. Wait, actually, in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, and c is AB. So, a is opposite angle A, which is at vertex A.

So, the sides are: a = BC, b = AC, c = AB.

We need to find AB·AC, which is c·b.

I remember that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the area and the sine of the included angle. Also, the area can be expressed in terms of the inradius and the semiperimeter.

Let me try to find the semiperimeter (s) first. The semiperimeter is (a + b + c)/2.

The area (Δ) of the triangle can be expressed as Δ = r·s, where r is the inradius. Given that r is 6, Δ = 6s.

Also, the area can be expressed using the formula Δ = (a*b*c)/(4R), where R is the circumradius. Here, R is 13, so Δ = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.

So, setting these two expressions for Δ equal:

6s = (a*b*c)/52

Hmm, maybe that's one equation.

Alternatively, area can also be expressed using the formula Δ = (1/2)*b*c*sin A. So, 6s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

Which comes down to 12s = b*c*sin A.

Hmm, not sure if that helps yet.

Another approach: Maybe use the formula for IA in terms of the sides.

Earlier, I found that IA = 2√39, and I have the formula IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2) = 2√39. So, sin(A/2) is √39/13, as we found.

Also, in triangle ABC, the sides can be related to the inradius and semiperimeter. The inradius r = Δ/s, where Δ is the area and s is the semiperimeter. So, r = 6 = Δ/s, so Δ = 6s.

Another formula for the area is Δ = (a + b + c)/2 * r = s*r, which is consistent.

Wait, maybe I can use the formula that relates the distance from the inradius to the vertex. I remember that in terms of the sides, the distance IA can also be expressed as IA = sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2). Let me check that.

Yes, I think that's correct. The formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A is sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2).

So, IA² = r² + (s - a)^2.

We know IA is 2√39, so IA² is 4*39=156. r is 6, so r² is 36. Therefore:

156 = 36 + (s - a)^2

So, (s - a)^2 = 156 - 36 = 120

Thus, s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30). Since s > a in a triangle, s - a is positive.

So, s - a = 2√30.

Hmm, s is the semiperimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2. So, s - a = (b + c - a)/2.

Thus, (b + c - a)/2 = 2√30 → b + c - a = 4√30 → a = b + c - 4√30.

That's one equation.

Now, perhaps I can find another equation involving a, b, c.

I also know that the triangle has a circumradius R =13. The formula relating sides and the circumradius is a = 2R sin A, which is from the Law of Sines.

Similarly, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.

But since I know angle A/2, maybe I can find sin A.

Wait, since we have sin(A/2) = √39 / 13, we can find cos(A/2) as sqrt(1 - sin²(A/2)) = sqrt(1 - 39/169) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.

Then, sin A can be found using the double-angle formula:

sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(√39/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = (2*√(39*130))/169.

Compute 39*130: 39*130 = 5070.

So, sin A = (2*sqrt(5070))/169.

Wait, 5070. Let me see if that's a perfect square or can be simplified. Hmm, 5070 divided by 10 is 507, which is 13*39, which is 13*13*3. So, 5070 = 10 *13*13*3= 13² * 30. So, sqrt(5070) = 13*sqrt(30).

So, sin A = (2*13*sqrt(30))/169 = (26√30)/169 = (2√30)/13.

So, sin A = 2√30 /13.

Then, a = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2√30)/13 = 2*2√30 = 4√30.

Wait, that's neat. So, a = 4√30. So, BC = a =4√30.

Earlier, we had a = b + c -4√30. So, substituting a =4√30 into that equation gives:

4√30 = b + c -4√30

So, b + c = 4√30 +4√30=8√30.

So, b + c =8√30.

But we need to find b*c, which is AB·AC = c*b.

Hmm, so perhaps I can find another equation involving b and c.

We also know that the area Δ =6s, and s is (a + b + c)/2.

Since a=4√30 and b + c=8√30, then s = (4√30 +8√30)/2=12√30/2=6√30.

So, s=6√30.

Also, Δ =6s=6*6√30=36√30.

But Δ can also be expressed as Δ= (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

We have sin A=2√30/13, so:

36√30= (1/2)*b*c*(2√30/13)

Simplify the right side:

(1/2)*b*c*(2√30/13)= (b*c *√30)/13

So,

36√30 = (b*c *√30)/13

Divide both sides by √30:

36 = (b*c)/13

Multiply both sides by 13:

b*c= 36*13=468.

So, AB·AC = c*b=468.

Wait, is that the answer? Let me double-check.

Wait, let me recap:

We had:

1. IA perpendicular to OI.
2. Used the formula OI² = R² - 2Rr = 13² - 2*13*6=169-156=13, so OI=√13.
3. Triangle OIA is right-angled at I, so OA²=OI² + IA² → 13²=13 + IA² → IA²=156 → IA=2√39.
4. Used the formula IA= r / sin(A/2), so 2√39=6/sin(A/2) → sin(A/2)=√39/13.
5. Then found sin A=2√30/13, leading to a=4√30.
6. From IA² = r² + (s -a)² → (s -a)=2√30.
7. From a=4√30, s=6√30, and b +c=8√30.
8. Calculated area Δ=6s=36√30.
9. Also, Δ=(1/2)bc sin A → 36√30=(1/2)bc*(2√30/13) → bc=468.

Yes, seems consistent.

So, the product AB·AC is 468.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the distance between the circumcenter \( O \) and the incenter \( I \) is given by the formula:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
where \( R = 13 \) is the circumradius and \( r = 6 \) is the inradius. Substituting the values:
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13
\]
Thus, \( OI = \sqrt{13} \).

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( OIA \) is a right triangle with \( OA = 13 \) (the circumradius) and \( OI = \sqrt{13} \). Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \implies 13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \implies 169 = 13 + IA^2 \implies IA^2 = 156 \implies IA = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

The distance from the incenter to vertex \( A \) is given by:
\[
IA = \frac{r}{\sin \frac{A}{2}}
\]
Substituting \( IA = 2\sqrt{39} \) and \( r = 6 \):
\[
2\sqrt{39} = \frac{6}{\sin \frac{A}{2}} \implies \sin \frac{A}{2} = \frac{6}{2\sqrt{39}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{39}} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}
\]

Using the double-angle identity for sine:
\[
\sin A = 2 \sin \frac{A}{2} \cos \frac{A}{2}
\]
We find \( \cos \frac{A}{2} \) using the Pythagorean identity:
\[
\cos^2 \frac{A}{2} = 1 - \sin^2 \frac{A}{2} = 1 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}\right)^2 = \frac{130}{169} \implies \cos \frac{A}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{130}}{13}
\]
Thus:
\[
\sin A = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{130}}{13} = \frac{2\sqrt{5070}}{169} = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13}
\]

Using the Law of Sines, the side \( a = BC \) opposite angle \( A \) is:
\[
a = 2R \sin A = 2 \cdot 13 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} = 4\sqrt{30}
\]

The semiperimeter \( s \) is:
\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
\]
From the relationship \( IA^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2 \):
\[
(2\sqrt{39})^2 = 6^2 + (s - a)^2 \implies 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 \implies (s - a)^2 = 120 \implies s - a = 2\sqrt{30}
\]
Since \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \), we have:
\[
\frac{b + c - a}{2} = 2\sqrt{30} \implies b + c = 8\sqrt{30}
\]

The area \( \Delta \) of the triangle can be expressed as:
\[
\Delta = r \cdot s = 6 \cdot 6\sqrt{30} = 36\sqrt{30}
\]
Using another area formula:
\[
\Delta = \frac{1}{2} bc \sin A \implies 36\sqrt{30} = \frac{1}{2} bc \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} \implies 36\sqrt{30} = \frac{bc \sqrt{30}}{13} \implies bc = 468
\]

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC \) is:
\[
\boxed{468}
\]
