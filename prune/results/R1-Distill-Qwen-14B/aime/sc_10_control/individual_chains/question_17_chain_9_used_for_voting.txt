Okay, so I need to solve this math problem where I'm given a set of rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, and then express r squared as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime. Finally, find p + q.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I know that for a rectangular box, the surface area is given by 2(lw + lh + wh) where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume is lwh. So here, surface area is 54, volume is 23.

I think the sphere that can contain the box will have its diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. Because the space diagonal is the longest distance between any two points in the box, so the sphere must at least have a diameter equal to that. Therefore, the radius would be half of the space diagonal.

So, the space diagonal of a box is sqrt(l² + w² + h²). So, the radius r is sqrt(l² + w² + h²)/2, which means r squared is (l² + w² + h²)/4.

So, I need to find the minimum possible value of (l² + w² + h²)/4. But wait, no, actually, since all boxes in set B have surface area 54 and volume 23, the space diagonal (and thus r) might vary. Wait, but the question says the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the boxes. So, the sphere must be big enough to contain any box from set B. Therefore, I need the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B, because the sphere must be able to contain even the box that requires the largest sphere. So, r squared would be (max(l² + w² + h²))/4.

Wait, that makes sense. So, to find the minimal sphere that can contain all boxes in B, I need to find the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B, then take half of that as r.

So, the problem reduces to maximizing l² + w² + h² given the constraints of surface area 54 and volume 23.

So, how to approach this optimization problem? I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but maybe there's a smarter way by using inequalities.

I remember that for a given surface area and volume, the box that maximizes the space diagonal is probably the one that's as "stretched out" as possible. But I need to confirm this.

Alternatively, maybe use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Let me set up the problem.

We need to maximize f(l, w, h) = l² + w² + h²

Subject to the constraints:

g(l, w, h) = 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54  (surface area)
h(l, w, h) = lwh = 23  (volume)

So, we can set up the Lagrangian:

L = l² + w² + h² - λ(2(lw + lh + wh) - 54) - μ(lwh - 23)

Then, take partial derivatives with respect to l, w, h, λ, μ and set them equal to zero.

Compute partial derivatives:

dL/dl = 2l - λ(2w + 2h) - μ(wh) = 0
dL/dw = 2w - λ(2l + 2h) - μ(lh) = 0
dL/dh = 2h - λ(2l + 2w) - μ(lw) = 0
dL/dλ = -(2(lw + lh + wh) - 54) = 0 => 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54
dL/dμ = -(lwh - 23) = 0 => lwh = 23

So, we have the system of equations:

1) 2l - 2λ(w + h) - μ wh = 0
2) 2w - 2λ(l + h) - μ lh = 0
3) 2h - 2λ(l + w) - μ lw = 0
4) 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54
5) lwh = 23

Hmm, this looks complicated. Maybe we can assume that the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? Like, maybe the box is a square prism, so l = w.

Let me try that. Let’s suppose l = w. Then, we can reduce the problem to two variables.

Let’s set l = w = x, and h = y.

So, surface area becomes 2(x^2 + 2xy) = 54 => x² + 2xy = 27.

Volume is x² y = 23 => y = 23/(x²).

Substitute y into surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23/x²) = 27

Simplify:

x² + (46)/x = 27

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ + 46 = 27x

Bring all terms to left:

x³ - 27x + 46 = 0

Hmm, need to solve for x. Let's try to see if there's an integer root. Let’s test x=2: 8 - 54 + 46 = 0. Yes! x=2 is a root.

So, factor the polynomial.

Divide x³ -27x +46 by (x - 2). Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46
        2   4  -46
      1  2  -23  0

So, the polynomial factors as (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23) = 0

Thus, x = 2 or x² + 2x -23 = 0.

Solve x² + 2x -23 =0:

x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92)] /2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)] /2 = [-2 ± 4√6]/2 = -1 ± 2√6.

Since x is positive, x = -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 + 4.899 ≈ 3.899.

So, possible solutions are x=2 and x= -1 + 2√6.

Let’s check if x=2 gives a valid solution.

x=2, so y=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

Then, surface area is 2(2*2 + 2*5.75 + 2*5.75) = 2(4 + 11.5 + 11.5) = 2(27) =54. Correct.

So, if l = w =2, h=5.75, which is 23/4.

So, space diagonal squared is 2² +2² + (23/4)^2 = 4 + 4 + (529/16) = 8 + 529/16 = (128 + 529)/16 = 657/16.

So, r squared would be 657/(16*4) = 657/64. Wait, no. Wait, r is half the space diagonal, so r squared is (l² + w² + h²)/4.

Wait, in this case, l=w=2, h=23/4.

So, l² + w² + h² = 4 +4 + (529/16) = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625, which is 657/16.

Wait, 41.0625 is equal to 41 + 1/16 * 10.25? Wait no, 0.0625 is 1/16. So, 41.0625 is 41 + 1/16, which is 656/16 + 1/16 = 657/16.

Thus, r squared is (657/16)/4 = 657/(64).

Wait, no! Wait, r is half of the space diagonal. So, the space diagonal is sqrt(l² + w² + h²). So, r is (sqrt(l² + w² + h²))/2. Therefore, r squared is (l² + w² + h²)/4.

Yes, that's correct. So, 657/16 divided by 4 is 657/(64). So, r squared is 657/64.

But wait, is this the maximum? Because I assumed that l = w. Maybe there's a case where l ≠ w which gives a larger space diagonal.

Hmm, so perhaps I need to check the other solution, x= -1 + 2√6 ≈3.899.

Let’s compute y for x= -1 + 2√6.

y = 23/(x²). Let’s compute x²:

x = -1 + 2√6.

x² = (-1)^2 + (2√6)^2 + 2*(-1)*(2√6) = 1 + 24 -4√6 =25 -4√6.

So, y=23/(25 -4√6).

To rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

y = [23*(25 +4√6)] / [ (25)^2 - (4√6)^2 ] = [23*(25 +4√6)] / [625 - 16*6] = [23*(25 +4√6)] / [625 -96] = [23*(25 +4√6)] / 529.

Since 529=23², so y= (25 +4√6)/23.

So, l = w = x ≈3.899, h = y≈(25 +4√6)/23 ≈ (25 +9.798)/23≈34.798/23≈1.513.

Now, compute l² + w² + h².

Since l = w, it's 2x² + h².

x²=25 -4√6, so 2x²=50 -8√6.

h² = y²= [(25 +4√6)/23]^2.

Compute that:

Let me compute numerator: (25 +4√6)^2 = 25² + 2*25*4√6 + (4√6)^2 =625 + 200√6 + 16*6=625 +200√6 +96=721 +200√6.

So, h²=(721 +200√6)/ (23²)= (721 +200√6)/529.

Thus, l² + w² + h²= 50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

Convert 50 -8√6 to over 529 denominator:

50 = 50 *529 /529 = 26450 /529

-8√6 = -8√6 *529 /529 = (-4232√6)/529

So, 50 -8√6 = (26450 -4232√6)/529.

Adding (721 +200√6)/529:

Total numerator: 26450 -4232√6 +721 +200√6 = (26450 +721) + (-4232√6 +200√6) =27171 -4032√6.

So, l² + w² + h²= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Now, compute 27171 -4032√6 numerically to see if it's positive.

4032√6 ≈4032 *2.449≈4032*2.449≈4032*2=8064, 4032*0.449≈1810 → total ≈8064+1810≈9874.

So, 27171 -9874≈17297. So, numerator is approximately 17297, denominator 529.

So, (17297)/529 ≈32.73.

Hmm, but let's see, 529*32=16928, 529*32.7=529*(32 +0.7)=16928 + 529*0.7≈16928 + 370≈17298, which is close to 17297.

So, approximately, l² + w² + h²≈32.73.

Wait, but earlier, when l=w=2, h=23/4, l² +w² +h²= 4+4+529/16=8 +33.0625=41.0625, which is about 41.06. That's larger than 32.73.

So, the case where l=w=2 gives a larger l² + w² + h². So, that's the maximum? Or is there a case where l≠w≠h and space diagonal is even larger?

Wait, but since when I set l=w, I found two possible solutions, one gives a higher diagonal, and one gives a lower. So, perhaps the maximum occurs at l=w=2, h=23/4.

But to be thorough, maybe I should check if the other case where l≠w could give a larger space diagonal.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is different.

Wait, perhaps the maximum of l² +w² +h² under the given constraints occurs when two variables are equal.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider another approach.

Alternatively, using the method of Lagrange multipliers, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal. Because in the system of equations, when we set l=w, we can find a solution.

Wait, in the system of equations when I set l=w, we get x=2 and x= -1 + 2√6 as possible solutions. So, perhaps the maximum occurs at l=w=2, h=23/4, giving l² +w² +h²=657/16≈41.06.

But earlier, when I assumed l=w, I got two solutions, one with x=2, leading to larger l² +w² +h², and another with x= -1 +2√6, leading to smaller l² +w² +h².

So, perhaps the maximum occurs at the x=2 case.

So, is that the maximum? Or is there a case where all three variables are different that gives a larger space diagonal?

Alternatively, perhaps we can use inequalities.

I know that for positive real numbers, the space diagonal l² +w² +h² is minimized when the box is a cube, but in our case, we have fixed surface area and volume, so the cube might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or other techniques.

But maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when l=w=2, h=23/4, as above, giving r squared=657/64.

Wait, let me compute 657/64. 64*10=640, so 10 and 17/64. So, 10.265625.

But wait, when I considered the other solution, x≈3.899, h≈1.513, the space diagonal was about sqrt(32.73)≈5.72, so r≈2.86, r squared≈8.18.

But in the first case, space diagonal was sqrt(41.0625)=6.409, r≈3.204, r squared≈10.2656.

But wait, the sphere must contain all boxes in B. So, the sphere must have a radius big enough to contain the box with the largest space diagonal.

So, I need to find the maximum possible l² +w² +h² given the constraints.

Earlier, when I set l=w, I got two cases: one where l=w=2, h=23/4, leading to l² +w² +h²=41.06, and another where l=w≈3.899, h≈1.513, leading to l² +w² +h²≈32.73.

So, the first case gives a larger space diagonal, so perhaps that's the maximum.

But maybe there's a case where l≠w≠h, leading to a larger space diagonal.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, so l=w, and I have considered that case.

So, perhaps the maximum is 41.06, so r squared is 41.06/4≈10.2656, which is 657/64.

So, 657 divided by 64. Are 657 and 64 coprime? 64 is 2^6.

657 divided by 3: 6+5+7=18, which is divisible by 3. 657/3=219.

219: 2+1+9=12, divisible by 3. 219/3=73.

So, 657=3^2 *73. 64 is 2^6. So, no common factors. So, 657 and 64 are coprime? Wait, 73 is a prime number, and 73 doesn't divide 64, so yes, 657 and 64 are coprime.

So, p=657, q=64, p+q=657+64=721.

But wait, I should make sure that there isn't a box with l, w, h all different that gives a larger l² +w² +h².

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers without assuming l=w.

So, going back to the system of equations:

1) 2l - 2λ(w + h) - μ wh =0
2) 2w - 2λ(l + h) - μ lh =0
3) 2h - 2λ(l + w) - μ lw =0
4) 2(lw + lh + wh)=54
5) lwh=23

Let me consider equations 1, 2, 3.

Let me subtract equation 1 and 2:

(2l - 2λ(w + h) - μ wh) - (2w - 2λ(l + h) - μ lh) =0

Simplify:

2l -2w -2λ(w +h - l -h ) - μ (wh - lh)=0

Simplify terms:

2(l -w) - 2λ(w - l) - μ h(w - l)=0

Factor (l -w):

(l -w)(2 + 2λ - μ h)=0

So, either l=w, or 2 + 2λ - μ h=0.

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 and 3:

2(w - h) - 2λ(l + h - l - w) - μ (lh - lw)=0

Simplify:

2(w -h) -2λ(h -w) - μ l (h -w)=0

Factor (w -h):

(w -h)(2 + 2λ + μ l)=0

So, either w=h, or 2 + 2λ + μ l=0.

Wait, this is getting a bit messy.

Case 1: l=w=h. Then, it's a cube.

But then, surface area=6l²=54 => l²=9 => l=3.

Volume=l³=27, but given volume is 23. So, not possible.

Case 2: l=w≠h.

We already considered that case, which gave us two solutions.

Case 3: l≠w≠h.

In this case, the other factors must be zero.

So, from equation 1-2: 2 + 2λ - μ h=0.

From equation 2-3: 2 + 2λ + μ l=0.

So, set up:

2 + 2λ - μ h=0 ...(a)

2 + 2λ + μ l=0 ...(b)

Subtract (a) from (b):

(2 + 2λ + μ l) - (2 + 2λ - μ h)=0 => μ(l + h)=0.

Since μ is a multiplier, it's non-zero (unless the constraints are dependent, which they aren't here). So, l + h=0.

But l and h are lengths, so positive, so l + h=0 is impossible. Therefore, this case is impossible.

Therefore, the only possible case is when l=w, or w=h, etc. So, we can assume without loss of generality that l=w.

So, in that case, we can proceed with l=w, which gives us the earlier result.

Thus, the maximum space diagonal occurs when l=w=2, h=23/4, giving l² +w² +h²=657/16, so r squared is 657/64.

Thus, p=657, q=64, p+q=721.

Wait, but I should double-check this.

Wait, 657/64 is in lowest terms because 657=3^2*73, 64=2^6, no common factors. So, yes.

Thus, the answer is 721.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we need to find the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box in the set \(\mathcal{B}\), where each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The value of \( r^2 \) is then expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to find \( p + q \).

### Key Steps:

1. **Surface Area and Volume Constraints**:
   - Surface area: \( 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 \)
   - Volume: \( lwh = 23 \)

2. **Space Diagonal and Sphere Radius**:
   - The space diagonal of a box is \( \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} \).
   - The radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere containing the box is half the space diagonal: \( r = \frac{\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}}{2} \).
   - Therefore, \( r^2 = \frac{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}{4} \).

3. **Maximizing the Space Diagonal**:
   - To find the smallest sphere that can contain all boxes in \(\mathcal{B}\), we need to maximize \( l^2 + w^2 + h^2 \) under the given constraints.

4. **Assuming \( l = w \)**:
   - Let \( l = w = x \) and \( h = y \).
   - Surface area becomes \( 2(x^2 + 2xy) = 54 \) ⇒ \( x^2 + 2xy = 27 \).
   - Volume becomes \( x^2 y = 23 \) ⇒ \( y = \frac{23}{x^2} \).
   - Substituting \( y \) into the surface area equation: \( x^3 - 27x + 46 = 0 \).
   - Solving, we find \( x = 2 \) is a root, giving \( y = \frac{23}{4} \).

5. **Calculating \( l^2 + w^2 + h^2 \)**:
   - For \( l = w = 2 \) and \( h = \frac{23}{4} \):
     \[
     l^2 + w^2 + h^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 + \left(\frac{23}{4}\right)^2 = 4 + 4 + \frac{529}{16} = \frac{657}{16}.
     \]

6. **Finding \( r^2 \)**:
   - \( r^2 = \frac{657}{16 \times 4} = \frac{657}{64} \).

7. **Simplifying the Fraction**:
   - \( 657 \) and \( 64 \) are coprime, so \( p = 657 \) and \( q = 64 \).

8. **Final Answer**:
   - \( p + q = 657 + 64 = 721 \).

### Answer:
\boxed{721}
