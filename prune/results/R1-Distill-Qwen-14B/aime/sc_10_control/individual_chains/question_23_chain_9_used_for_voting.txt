Okay, so I have this problem here where there are four points A, B, C, D on a hyperbola, and they form a rhombus. The hyperbola equation is given as x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, BD² must be the square of one of the diagonals, maybe the longer one?

First, I remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. But wait, does that apply to all rhombuses? I think so, yes. So, the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint. So each diagonal is a line passing through the origin, and each point of the rhombus lies on the hyperbola.

Let me think about parametrizing the points. Since the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes, maybe the points can be expressed in terms of some parameter. Let me recall that for hyperbola parametrization, we can use hyperbolic functions. So, points on the hyperbola can be written as (a secθ, b tanθ), where a² = 20 and b² = 24. So, a = sqrt(20) and b = sqrt(24). So, points can be (sqrt(20) secθ, sqrt(24) tanθ).

But since ABCD is a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors. So, if I suppose that points A and C are at opposite ends of one diagonal, and B and D are at opposite ends of the other diagonal. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin.

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1. Let me denote the slope of AC as m, then the slope of BD would be -1/m.

Wait, but if AC is a diagonal, and A and C are points on the hyperbola, then AC must be a chord of the hyperbola. Similarly for BD.

But since both diagonals pass through the origin, and all points lie on the hyperbola, maybe the points can be related in some way.

Wait, let's consider points A, B, C, D such that the diagonals are AC and BD. So, the diagonals are perpendicular, and their midpoints are at the origin.

So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q). So, the four points are (x, y), (p, q), (-x, -y), (-p, -q).

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B must be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

Calculating the distance AB: sqrt[(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2]

Distance BC: sqrt[(-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2]

Since AB = BC,

sqrt[(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2] = sqrt[(-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2]

Squaring both sides,

(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2

Expanding,

(p² - 2px + x²) + (q² - 2qy + y²) = (x² + 2px + p²) + (y² + 2qy + q²)

Simplify both sides:

Left side: p² - 2px + x² + q² - 2qy + y²

Right side: x² + 2px + p² + y² + 2qy + q²

Subtract right side from left side:

-4px -4qy = 0 → -4px -4qy = 0 → px + qy = 0

So, this gives us the condition that p*x + q*y = 0.

Hmm, so for points A(x, y) and B(p, q), their coordinates satisfy p x + q y = 0.

Now, since A and B are on the hyperbola, they satisfy x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 and p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

Also, since the diagonals are AC and BD, and they are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1. So, the slope of AC is y/x, and the slope of BD is q/p. So, (y/x)*(q/p) = -1.

So, (y q)/(x p) = -1 → y q = -x p → y q + x p = 0.

Wait, but we already have p x + q y = 0 from before. So, this is the same as y q + x p = 0. So, the condition about the slopes being perpendicular is the same as the side equality condition.

So, that's consistent. So, we have the two conditions:

1. x²/20 - y²/24 = 1
2. p²/20 - q²/24 = 1
3. p x + q y = 0

So, I need to relate these variables.

Let me express p in terms of q and x, y.

From equation 3: p x = -q y → p = (-q y)/x.

Plugging this into equation 2:

[(-q y)/x]^2 /20 - q²/24 = 1

Calculating:

(q² y²)/(20 x²) - q²/24 = 1

Factor q²:

q² [ (y²)/(20 x²) - 1/24 ] = 1

So, solve for q²:

q² = 1 / [ (y²)/(20 x²) - 1/24 ]

But we also know that x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 → y² = (x²/20 - 1)*24.

So, let's substitute y² into the expression for q².

y² = (x²/20 - 1) *24

So,

q² = 1 / [ ((x²/20 - 1)*24 )/(20 x²) - 1/24 ]

Let me compute the denominator:

First term: ( (x²/20 - 1) * 24 ) / (20 x² )

= (24 x²/20 - 24) / (20 x² )

= ( (24/20)x² - 24 ) / (20 x² )

= ( (6/5)x² - 24 ) / (20 x² )

Second term: -1/24

So, denominator becomes:

[ (6x²/5 - 24) / (20x²) ) ] - 1/24

Let me combine these terms.

Let me find a common denominator for the two fractions. The denominators are 20x² and 24. The least common multiple is 120x².

So, rewrite each term:

First term:

(6x²/5 - 24) / (20x²) = [ (6x² - 120)/5 ] / (20x² ) = (6x² - 120)/(100x² )

Wait, maybe I should compute each part separately.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recompute the denominator:

Denominator = (6x²/5 - 24)/(20x²) - 1/24

Compute each term:

First term: (6x²/5 - 24)/(20x²) = (6x² - 120)/5 / (20x² ) = (6x² - 120)/(100x²)

Second term: -1/24

So, denominator is:

(6x² - 120)/(100x²) - 1/24

Find common denominator, which is 600x²:

= [ (6x² - 120)*6 - 25x² ] / 600x²

Compute numerator:

6*(6x² - 120) = 36x² - 720

Minus 25x²:

36x² - 25x² -720 = 11x² - 720

So denominator is (11x² - 720)/(600x²)

So, q² = 1 / [ (11x² - 720)/(600x²) ) ] = 600x² / (11x² - 720 )

But from the hyperbola equation, y² = (x²/20 -1)*24.

So, substituting back into q²:

q² = 600x² / (11x² - 720 )

But also, from the hyperbola equation, x² must be greater than or equal to 20, since it's a hyperbola opening along the x-axis.

So, x² ≥ 20.

Now, BD is one of the diagonals. So, BD is the distance between B and D.

Since D is (-p, -q), so the distance BD is sqrt[ (p + p)^2 + (q + q)^2 ] = sqrt[ (2p)^2 + (2q)^2 ] = 2 sqrt(p² + q² )

Similarly, AC is the distance between A and C, which is sqrt[ (x + x)^2 + (y + y)^2 ] = 2 sqrt(x² + y² )

So, BD² = 4 (p² + q² )

Similarly, AC² = 4 (x² + y² )

But since BD² is the quantity we're interested in, let me focus on BD² = 4 (p² + q² )

From earlier, we have q² = 600x² / (11x² - 720 )

Also, from equation 3: p x + q y = 0 → p = - (q y)/x

So, p² = (q² y² ) / x²

But from the hyperbola equation, y² = (x²/20 -1)*24.

So, p² = (q² * (x²/20 -1)*24 ) / x²

Substituting q²:

p² = [ (600x² / (11x² -720 )) * (x²/20 -1)*24 ] / x²

Simplify:

= [ (600x² * (x²/20 -1)*24 ) / (11x² -720 ) ] / x²

= [ (600 * (x²/20 -1)*24 ) / (11x² -720 ) ]

Simplify numerator:

600 *24 = 14400

(x²/20 -1) = (x² -20)/20

So,

= [ 14400 * (x² - 20)/20 ) / (11x² -720 ) ]

Simplify 14400 /20 = 720

So,

= [720(x² -20) / (11x² -720 ) ]

So, p² = 720(x² -20)/(11x² -720 )

Then, BD² = 4(p² + q² )

We have q² = 600x²/(11x² -720 )

So,

BD² = 4 [ 720(x² -20)/(11x² -720 ) + 600x²/(11x² -720 ) ]

Combine terms:

= 4 [ (720x² - 720*20 + 600x² ) / (11x² -720 ) ]

Combine numerator:

720x² + 600x² = 1320x²

720*20 = 14400

So,

= 4 [ (1320x² -14400 ) / (11x² -720 ) ]

Factor numerator:

1320x² -14400 = 120*(11x² - 120 )

Wait, 1320 /120=11, 14400/120=120.

Yes, 1320x² -14400 = 120*(11x² - 120 )

Denominator: 11x² -720 = 11(x²) -720.

Wait, 11x² -720 is 11x² -720 = 11(x²) -720. Hmm, perhaps factor 11x² -720 as 11(x² - 720/11 )

But in the numerator, we have 120*(11x² -120 )

So,

BD² = 4 * [ 120*(11x² -120 ) / (11x² -720 ) ]

Simplify:

BD² = 4 * 120 * [ (11x² -120 ) / (11x² -720 ) ]

Which is,

BD² = 480 * [ (11x² -120 ) / (11x² -720 ) ]

Let me set t = 11x² -120. Then, denominator becomes t - (720 - 120 ) = t - 600.

Wait, 11x² -720 = (11x² -120 ) -600 = t -600.

So, BD² = 480 * [ t / (t -600) ]

Hmm, so BD² = 480 * t / (t -600 )

But x² must be ≥20, so 11x² ≥ 220.

So, t =11x² -120 ≥ 220 -120 =100.

So, t ≥100.

Also, since the denominator t -600 must not be zero, so t ≠600 → 11x² -120 ≠600 → x²≠ (720)/11 ≈65.4545.

But x² must be ≥20, so t ranges from 100 to infinity, excluding t=600. Wait, but when x² increases, t increases as well.

Wait, no, wait. Let me see, when x² approaches infinity, t =11x² -120 approaches infinity, and denominator t-600 approaches infinity. So, BD² approaches 480*(t/(t-600)) → 480 as t approaches infinity.

Wait, because t/(t -600) approaches 1 as t→infty.

So, BD² approaches 480 as x² increases.

But when t approaches 600 from above, BD² approaches 480*600/(600-600) which is infinity. So, BD² can be made arbitrarily large by approaching t=600 from above.

Wait, but when x² is such that t approaches 600, which is when x² = (600 +120)/11 = 720/11≈65.4545.

So, as x² approaches 720/11 from above, BD² approaches infinity.

But wait, what happens when x² approaches 720/11 from below?

Wait, if x² is less than 720/11, then t =11x² -120 < 600.

So, denominator becomes t -600 negative. So, BD² is 480 * [ t/(t-600) ] which would be negative. But BD² can't be negative. So, that suggests that t/(t -600) must be positive.

So, t/(t -600) >0 requires t and t-600 to have the same sign.

So, if t>600, then t-600>0, so t/(t -600) positive.

If t<600, then t-600 <0, so t/(t -600) negative.

But BD² is positive, so we must have t/(t -600) positive, which requires t>600.

Thus, t must be greater than 600. So, x² must satisfy 11x² -120 >600 → 11x² >720 → x²>720/11≈65.4545.

So, only when x²>720/11, BD² is positive.

But earlier, we saw that x² must be ≥20, but in reality, when x² is between 20 and 720/11, BD² is negative, which is impossible. So, perhaps the rhombus can only exist when x²>720/11. But wait, the problem says "such that ABCD is a rhombus." So, perhaps not all x²≥20 are possible, but only x²>720/11.

Wait, but how? If x² is less than 720/11, the BD² would be negative, which is impossible. So, that would mean for such rhombi to exist, x² must be greater than 720/11.

So, from that, BD² =480 t/(t-600), where t=11x²-120>600.

So, t>600, so t=600 +k, where k>0.

So, BD²=480*(600 +k)/k=480*(600/k +1 )

As k approaches 0 from above, BD² approaches infinity. As k approaches infinity, BD² approaches 480*(0 +1)=480.

So, the minimal value of BD² is 480, approached as x² approaches infinity. But wait, as t approaches infinity, x² approaches infinity, BD² approaches 480.

Wait, that seems conflicting with earlier thought that BD² approaches 480 as x² approaches infinity.

So, BD² is always greater than 480? Because when t>600, BD²=480*(t/(t-600)).

Let me rewrite that expression:

BD²=480*(t)/(t-600)=480*(1 + 600/(t-600)).

Wait, wait, let's do it correctly.

t/(t -600)= [ (t-600) +600 ]/(t -600 )=1 +600/(t-600 )

So, BD²=480*(1 +600/(t-600 ))

Since t>600, t-600>0, so 600/(t-600 )>0.

Thus, BD²=480*(1 + positive number )

So, BD²>480.

And as t approaches 600 from above, 600/(t-600 ) approaches infinity, so BD² approaches infinity. As t approaches infinity, 600/(t-600 ) approaches 0, so BD² approaches 480*1=480.

So, the minimal value of BD² is 480, and it can be as large as desired. So, BD² ≥480.

But the question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, BD² can get as close to 480 as desired, but is always greater than 480. So, 480 is the infimum of BD².

Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations because I think I might have miscalculated somewhere.

Wait, looking back, BD²=480*t/(t-600 ), t=11x² -120 >600.

So, t=11x² -120>600 →11x²>720 →x²>720/11≈65.4545.

So, let me take x² approaching 720/11 from above. So, x²=720/11 +ε, where ε approaches 0+.

Then, t=11*(720/11 +ε ) -120=720 +11ε -120=600 +11ε.

So, t=600 +11ε.

Then, BD²=480*(600 +11ε )/(11ε )=480*(600/(11ε ) +1 )

As ε approaches 0+, BD² approaches infinity.

But when x² approaches infinity, t=11x² -120 approaches infinity, so BD²=480*t/(t-600 )=480*(t)/(t(1 -600/t ))≈480*(1/(1 -600/t ))≈480*(1 +600/t ) using the approximation 1/(1 -a )≈1+a for small a.

As t→infty, BD²≈480*(1 +0 )=480.

But wait, as t increases, 600/t gets smaller, so BD² approaches 480 from above.

So, BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but never less than 480.

Therefore, the infimum of BD² is 480, meaning the greatest number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.

Wait, but the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, since BD² is always greater than 480, 480 is the largest number that is less than BD² for all rhombi.

Therefore, the answer is 480.

But let me check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

We started with points A(x,y), B(p,q), C(-x,-y), D(-p,-q) on the hyperbola.

We applied the condition that AB=BC, which led to p x + q y=0.

Then, we expressed p in terms of q, substituted into the hyperbola equation, and found expressions for q² in terms of x².

Then, we expressed BD² in terms of x², which led us to BD²=480 * t/(t-600 ), where t=11x² -120.

We found that t must be greater than 600, so BD² approaches 480 as t approaches infinity.

So, 480 is the infimum.

Therefore, the answer is 480.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we consider four points \( A(x, y) \), \( B(p, q) \), \( C(-x, -y) \), and \( D(-p, -q) \) on the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \), forming a rhombus \( ABCD \) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) are perpendicular, and the condition \( px + qy = 0 \) arises from the equality of the sides of the rhombus.

Using the hyperbola equation and the rhombus conditions, we derive expressions for \( p^2 \) and \( q^2 \) in terms of \( x^2 \) and \( y^2 \). Substituting \( y^2 = \frac{24}{20}x^2 - 24 \), we find that \( BD^2 = 480 \cdot \frac{t}{t - 600} \), where \( t = 11x^2 - 120 \). 

Analyzing the behavior of \( BD^2 \), we find that as \( x^2 \) approaches infinity, \( BD^2 \) approaches 480 from above. Thus, the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi is:

\[
\boxed{480}
\]
