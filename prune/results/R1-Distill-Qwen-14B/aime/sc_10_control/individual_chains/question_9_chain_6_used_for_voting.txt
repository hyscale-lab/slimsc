Okay, so I've got this problem here: There are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but they have some properties that might help here. The problem gives me two equations involving logarithms, each equal to 10. Let me write them down:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I should probably try to simplify each of these equations using logarithm properties. I remember that log_b(a^k) = k * log_b(a). So maybe I can apply that here.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Applying the power rule, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. So, x times log base x of y equals 10. Hmm, that's simpler.

Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the same power rule, that's 4y * log_y(x) = 10. So, 4y times log base y of x equals 10.

Now, I notice that both equations have logarithms of y with base x and vice versa. I remember another logarithm property: log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). That could be useful.

Let me denote log_x(y) as some variable to make it easier. Maybe let’s say a = log_x(y). Then, from the first equation, a = log_x(y) = 10 / x. Because from the first equation, x * a = 10, so a = 10 / x.

Since a is log_x(y), which is 1 / log_y(x). Let's let b = log_y(x). Then, a = 1 / b. And from the second equation, 4y * b = 10. So, b = 10 / (4y) = 5 / (2y).

But since a = 1 / b, substituting in, a = (2y) / 5. But earlier, a was 10 / x. So, 10 / x = (2y) / 5. Let's write that as an equation:

10 / x = (2y) / 5

I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's cross-multiply:

10 * 5 = 2y * x

Which simplifies to:

50 = 2xy

Divide both sides by 2:

25 = xy

So, xy is 25? Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes.

Wait, hold on. Let me retrace. We had:

log_x(y^x) = 10 → x log_x(y) = 10 → log_x(y) = 10/x.

Similarly, log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 → 4y log_y(x) =10 → log_y(x)=10/(4y).

But since log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x), substituting gives:

log_x(y) = log_y(x)^{-1} → 10/x = [10/(4y)]^{-1}.

Wait, that would mean 10/x = (4y)/10.

So, 10/x = (4y)/10. Cross-multiplying: 100 = 4xy. So, 4xy = 100 → xy = 25. Oh okay, same result. So that seems consistent.

So, that gives me xy =25. Let me just check if this makes sense. Let's assume that xy=25, so y=25/x. Let me plug this back into the original equations to see if it works.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) =10. Substituting y=25/x, we get log_x( (25/x)^x )=10.

Wait, that's log_x(25^x / x^x) = log_x( (25/x)^x ). Which is x * log_x(25/x). But log_x(25/x) can be split as log_x(25) - log_x(x) = log_x(25) -1.

So, the first equation becomes x*(log_x(25) -1) =10.

Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10.

Substituting y=25/x, we get log_{25/x}(x^{4*(25/x)} )=10.

Let me simplify that.

First, the exponent 4*(25/x) is 100/x. So, the expression inside is x^{100/x}.

So, log_{25/x}(x^{100/x}) = (100/x)*log_{25/x}(x).

Because log_b(a^k) =k log_b(a).

Hmm, log_{25/x}(x) is equal to 1 / log_x(25/x) by the reciprocal property. And log_x(25/x) is log_x(25) - log_x(x) = log_x(25) -1, same as before.

So, log_{25/x}(x) = 1/(log_x(25) -1).

Putting it all together: (100/x) * [1/(log_x(25)-1)] =10.

So, let me write both equations again.

From first equation: x*(log_x(25) -1) =10. Let me denote log_x(25) as c. So, x*(c -1) =10.

From the second equation: (100/x) * [1/(c -1)] =10.

Let me write this as (100/x) =10*(c -1).

So, 100/x =10(c -1). Divide both sides by 10: 10/x = c -1.

From the first equation, x*(c -1) =10. But c -1 is 10/x, so substituting:

x*(10/x)=10 → 10=10.

Which is true. So, the equations are consistent and our assumption that xy=25 holds.

Therefore, the product xy is 25.
