Okay, so I have this complex number problem to solve. The question is asking for the largest possible real part of the expression:

\[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\]

where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to recall that any complex number \( z \) with magnitude 4 can be written in the form \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). Alternatively, since \( |z| = 4 \), the reciprocal \( 1/z \) will have magnitude \( 1/4 \), so \( 1/z = \frac{\overline{z}}{|z|^2} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \) because \( |z|^2 = 16 \).

Wait, let me make sure about that. If \( z = a + bi \), then \( \overline{z} = a - bi \), and \( 1/z = \overline{z}/(a^2 + b^2) \). Since \( |z| = 4 \), \( a^2 + b^2 = 16 \), so \( 1/z = \overline{z}/16 \). That's correct.

So, maybe I can express everything in terms of \( z \) and \( \overline{z} \). Let me write the given expression:

Let me denote \( A = 75 + 117i \) and \( B = 96 + 144i \). Then the expression becomes:

\( A z + \frac{B}{z} \).

Since \( |z| = 4 \), \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \), so substituting that in, we get:

\( A z + \frac{B \overline{z}}{16} \).

Hmm, that might be helpful. Let me write that out:

\( (75 + 117i) z + \frac{(96 + 144i) \overline{z}}{16} \).

Alternatively, perhaps I can write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta \) is real. Then \( \overline{z} = 4e^{-i\theta} \), and \( 1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \).

Wait, another approach: Let me express \( z \) as \( 4e^{i\theta} \), so \( 1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). Substituting these into the expression:

\( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i) \cdot \frac{1}{4} e^{-i\theta} \).

Simplify the constants:

First term: \( 4*(75 + 117i) e^{i\theta} = (300 + 468i) e^{i\theta} \).

Second term: \( (96 + 144i)/4 = 24 + 36i \), so \( (24 + 36i) e^{-i\theta} \).

So the entire expression becomes:

\( (300 + 468i) e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i) e^{-i\theta} \).

Hmm, that's a sum of two complex exponentials. Maybe I can write this in terms of sine and cosine functions.

Alternatively, I can express each term in terms of their real and imaginary parts. Let's see.

Let me denote \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So, expanding the first term:

\( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \).

Similarly, the second term:

\( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2 \sin\theta \).

Wait, \( i^2 = -1 \), so the last term becomes \( +36 \sin\theta \).

So, putting it all together, let me compute the real and imaginary parts separately.

Real parts:

From first term: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \).

From second term: \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \).

Total real part: \( (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta \) = \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

Imaginary parts:

From first term: \( 300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta \).

From second term: \( -24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta \).

Total imaginary part: \( (300 -24)\sin\theta + (468 +36)\cos\theta \) = \( 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta \).

But wait, the problem asks for the largest possible real part of the expression. So I need to maximize the real part, which is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

So, the real part is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). Let me denote this as \( R(\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

I need to find the maximum value of \( R(\theta) \). I remember that an expression of the form \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) can be rewritten as \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \) or \( R\sin(\theta + \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \), and \( \phi \) is some phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is \( R \), which occurs when the cosine or sine term is 1.

Wait, in this case, the expression is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). Let me write this as \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \), where \( a = 324 \) and \( b = -432 \).

So, the amplitude \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Let me compute that.

Compute 324^2: 324 * 324. Let me calculate:

324 * 300 = 97,200

324 * 24 = 7,776

So 97,200 + 7,776 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: 432*432. Let me compute:

400^2 = 160,000

2*400*32 = 25,600

32^2=1,024

So, 160,000 +25,600 +1,024= 186,624.

So, 324^2=104,976 and 432^2=186,624. Since b is -432, b^2 is same as 432^2.

So, R= sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

What's sqrt(291,600)? Let's see: 540^2=291,600 because 500^2=250,000, 540^2=(500+40)^2=500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2=250,000 +40,000 +1,600=291,600. So R=540.

Therefore, the maximum value of R(θ) is 540.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula. The expression is \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \), which can be written as \( R\cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). So, the maximum value is R, which is 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

Hmm, but wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Because in our case, the expression for the real part is R(θ) = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Wait, but when we write \( a\cos\theta + b \sin\theta \), a is 324, and b is -432. So, the amplitude is sqrt(324² + (-432)²) = sqrt(324² +432²) which is indeed 540. So, the maximum real part is 540.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier when expanding the terms. Because I might have messed up the signs.

Let me go back:

Real part:

First term: 300 cosθ -468 sinθ.

Second term:24 cosθ +36 sinθ.

So adding them: (300 +24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Yes, correct so far.

So, that's correct. So, then, the real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which has maximum 540.

Wait, but is that possible? Because the expression is (75+117i)z + (96 +144i)/z with |z|=4.

Wait, 75+117i and 96+144i look like multiples of each other. Let me check.

Compute 96/75 = 1.28, 144/117 = 1.23. Hmm, not exactly the same. Wait, 96=75*(1.28), 144=117*(1.23). Not exact. Maybe they're scalar multiples? Not quite. So perhaps I can factor or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that since |z|=4, 1/z = conjugate(z)/16. So, maybe the original expression can be written as (75+117i) z + (96+144i) conjugate(z)/16. Let me write that:

Let me denote \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), so \( \overline{z} =4 e^{-i\theta} \). Then, the expression becomes:

(75 +117i)*4 e^{iθ} + (96 +144i)*4 e^{-iθ}/16.

Simplify:

First term: (75*4 +117i*4) e^{iθ} = (300 + 468i) e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 +144i)*4/16 = (96 +144i)/4 = 24 +36i. So second term is (24 +36i) e^{-iθ}.

So, the expression is (300 +468i)e^{iθ} + (24 +36i) e^{-iθ}.

Wait, this is the same as before. So, when I expand this, the real parts are 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, as I had earlier.

So, the maximum real part is 540.

Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me consider another approach for confirmation.

Alternatively, using calculus. Let me consider the real part R(θ) = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

To find the maximum, take derivative with respect to θ:

dR/dθ = -324 sinθ -432 cosθ.

Set derivative to zero:

-324 sinθ -432 cosθ = 0

=> 324 sinθ +432 cosθ = 0

Divide both sides by 108: 3 sinθ +4 cosθ =0.

So, 3 sinθ = -4 cosθ.

=> tanθ = -4/3.

So, θ = arctan(-4/3). But since tan has period π, solutions are θ = arctan(-4/3) + kπ.

But we can compute sinθ and cosθ at θ where tanθ = -4/3.

Let me construct a right triangle where the opposite side is -4 and adjacent is 3, but since tan is negative, θ is in a quadrant where sine and cosine have opposite signs. So either θ in quadrant II or IV.

But let's compute sinθ and cosθ. The hypotenuse would be sqrt(3² + (-4)^2) =5.

So,

If θ is in quadrant IV: cosθ = 3/5, sinθ = -4/5.

If θ is in quadrant II: cosθ = -3/5, sinθ =4/5.

But when I plug into R(θ), let's see:

Compute R(θ) at θ where tanθ = -4/3.

Case 1: θ in IV: cosθ=3/5, sinθ=-4/5.

R(θ) = 324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = (2700)/5 =540.

Case 2: θ in II: cosθ=-3/5, sinθ=4/5.

R(θ) =324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5)= (-972/5) - (1728/5) = (-2700)/5 = -540.

So, maximum value is 540, and minimum is -540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Hmm, seems consistent. So, is 540 the correct answer?

Wait another thought: Let me check if the expression can be rewritten in another way that might make the maximum more evident.

Original expression: (75 + 117i)z + (96 +144i)/z, |z|=4.

Let me factor out z from the first term and 1/z from the second term, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that (75 + 117i)z + (96 +144i)/z can be rewritten as z*(75 +117i) + (96 +144i)/z.

Let me write z =4 e^{iθ}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Expressing everything in terms of e^{iθ} and e^{-iθ}, as I did earlier.

But perhaps I can write the entire expression as a combination of exponentials and then combine terms.

Let me compute the coefficients:

(75 +117i) *4 = 300 + 468i.

(96 +144i)/4 =24 +36i.

So, expression is (300 +468i)e^{iθ} + (24 +36i)e^{-iθ}.

Let me denote A =300 +468i, B=24 +36i.

So, expression is A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

The real part of this is Re(A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}) = Re(A e^{iθ}) + Re(B e^{-iθ}).

Which is equal to Re(A) cosθ - Im(A) sinθ + Re(B) cosθ + Im(B) sinθ.

Wait, because Re(B e^{-iθ}) = Re(B (cosθ -i sinθ)) = Re(B) cosθ + Im(B) sinθ.

So, combining:

(Re(A) + Re(B)) cosθ + (-Im(A) + Im(B)) sinθ.

Which is exactly what I had earlier: (324) cosθ + (-432) sinθ.

Thus, the maximum is 540.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the expression as a single exponential or in terms of phasors.

Alternatively, think of the expression as a sum of two complex numbers: A e^{iθ} and B e^{-iθ}.

Each has a certain magnitude and phase.

But since the problem is about the real part, and we've already found the maximum by using the amplitude formula, I think that's sufficient.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let me write the entire expression as a complex function and find its real part.

Let me denote:

Let me write the expression:

E = (75 +117i) z + (96 +144i)/z.

We can write z =4 e^{iθ}, so 1/z = (1/4) e^{-iθ}.

Thus, E = (75 +117i) *4 e^{iθ} + (96 +144i) * (1/4) e^{-iθ}.

Compute constants:

(75 +117i)*4 = 300 +468i.

(96 +144i)/4 =24 +36i.

So, E= (300 +468i) e^{iθ} + (24 +36i) e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each term:

Term1: (300 +468i) e^{iθ} = 300 e^{iθ} +468i e^{iθ}.

Term2: (24 +36i)e^{-iθ} =24 e^{-iθ} +36i e^{-iθ}.

So, E = 300 e^{iθ} +468i e^{iθ} +24 e^{-iθ} +36i e^{-iθ}.

Grouping terms:

E = (300 e^{iθ} +24 e^{-iθ}) +i(468 e^{iθ} +36 e^{-iθ}).

Now, the real part of E is Re(300 e^{iθ} +24 e^{-iθ}) because the other terms are multiplied by i, which would contribute to the imaginary part.

Wait, let me compute Re(E):

Re(E) = Re(300 e^{iθ} +24 e^{-iθ}) =300 cosθ +24 cosθ =324 cosθ.

Wait, that can't be because earlier calculation was 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, because in my previous expansion, I had to include both real and imaginary parts.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the real parts correctly.

Wait, in E, the terms are:

300 e^{iθ} +24 e^{-iθ} +i(468 e^{iθ} +36 e^{-iθ}).

So, the real part is Re(300 e^{iθ}) + Re(24 e^{-iθ}) =300 cosθ +24 cosθ=324 cosθ.

The imaginary part is Re(468 e^{iθ}) + Re(36 e^{-iθ})=468 sinθ +36 sinθ=504 sinθ.

Wait, but this contradicts my earlier result.

Wait, so according to this, the real part is 324 cosθ and the imaginary part is 504 sinθ.

But earlier I had Re(E)=324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Wait, this is conflicting. That suggests I made a mistake in my earlier calculation.

Wait, let me go back.

Wait, earlier, when I expanded the expression as:

(300 +468i)(cosθ +i sinθ) + (24 +36i)(cosθ -i sinθ).

So, let me recompute that:

First term: (300 +468i)(cosθ + i sinθ).

=300 cosθ + 300i sinθ +468i cosθ -468 sinθ.

Second term: (24 +36i)(cosθ -i sinθ).

=24 cosθ -24i sinθ +36i cosθ -36i^2 sinθ.

=24 cosθ -24i sinθ +36i cosθ +36 sinθ.

So, combining all terms:

Real parts:

300 cosθ -468 sinθ +24 cosθ +36 sinθ.

Imaginary parts:

300 sinθ +468 cosθ -24 sinθ +36 cosθ.

So, real parts:

(300 +24) cosθ + (-468 +36) sinθ =324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Imaginary parts:

(300 -24) sinθ + (468 +36) cosθ =276 sinθ +504 cosθ.

But according to the other approach, when I wrote E as (300 e^{iθ} +24 e^{-iθ}) +i(468 e^{iθ} +36 e^{-iθ}), the real part is 324 cosθ, and the imaginary part is 504 sinθ + ... Wait, no, that's not matching.

Wait, I think I messed up the other approach. Because in that approach, I wrote E as:

E = (300 +468i) e^{iθ} + (24 +36i) e^{-iθ}.

But when I split it into real and imaginary parts, I have:

Real part: Re[(300 +468i) e^{iθ}] + Re[(24 +36i) e^{-iθ}].

Which is 300 cosθ -468 sinθ +24 cosθ +36 sinθ.

Which is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Which matches the earlier result.

So, in the other approach, when I thought of the real part as 324 cosθ, that was incorrect because I had split E into two parts incorrectly.

So, my initial calculation was correct: the real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which has a maximum of 540.

So, that's the answer.

Wait, to make sure, let me think of another approach using vectors or dot products.

The real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. Think of this as the dot product of vectors (324, -432) and (cosθ, sinθ). The maximum value is the magnitude of the vector (324, -432), which is sqrt(324² + (-432)²) =540. So, yes, that aligns with the earlier calculation.

Therefore, I can confidently say the maximum real part is 540.

To find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Express \( z \) in polar form**: Since \( |z| = 4 \), let \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). Then, \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \).

2. **Substitute \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) into the expression**:
   \[
   (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i) \cdot \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}.
   \]
   Simplify the constants:
   \[
   (75 \cdot 4 + 117i \cdot 4)e^{i\theta} + (96/4 + 144i/4)e^{-i\theta} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}.
   \]

3. **Expand using Euler's formula**:
   \[
   (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
   \]
   Compute the real and imaginary parts separately:
   - Real part: \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).
   - Imaginary part: \( 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta \).

4. **Maximize the real part**:
   The real part is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \), which can be written as \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \) where \( R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = 540 \). The maximum value of this expression is \( R = 540 \).

Thus, the largest possible real part of the given expression is \(\boxed{540}\).
