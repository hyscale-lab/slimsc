Okay, so I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ +1 is divisible by p². Hmm. Let's try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that for primes p, if p divides n⁴ +1, then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p. That means the order of n modulo p divides 8. But wait, p is a prime, so the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1. So, the order of n modulo p must divide both 8 and p-1. Therefore, 8 divides p-1? Wait, no, the order divides 8, so 8 must divide the order of the multiplicative group, which is p-1. So, p ≡ 1 mod 8. Or maybe p is 2? Because 2 is a prime, and let me check if 2 could satisfy this condition.

Wait, if p=2, then n⁴ +1. For n=1, 1 +1 = 2, which is divisible by 2, but 2²=4 doesn't divide 2. So n=1 doesn't work for p=2. Next, n=2: 16 +1=17, which isn't divisible by 4. Similarly, n=3: 81 +1=82, also not divisible by 4. Wait, maybe p=2 can't work because n⁴ is always even when n is even, so n⁴ +1 would be odd, and when n is odd, n⁴ is 1 mod 2, so n⁴ +1 is 2 mod 2, which is 0 mod 2. But p²=4; does n⁴ +1 ever divisible by 4? Let me see: for n odd, n=1: 1+1=2, not divisible by 4. n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 82 mod 4 is 2. Similarly, n=5: 625 +1=626, 626 mod 4 is 2. So, n⁴ +1 is always 2 mod 4 when n is odd, so p=2 is out since 4 doesn't divide n⁴ +1. So p must be an odd prime, likely congruent to 1 mod 8.

So, the primes to consider are primes where p ≡1 mod 8. The smallest primes after 2 are 17, 97, etc. Wait, 17 is the next one after 2. Wait, no, wait. Let me list primes congruent to 1 mod 8. Let's see: 17, 97, 113, 193, etc. But 17 is the smallest such prime. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe there's a smaller prime p where p² divides n⁴ +1. Let's check smaller primes first, just in case.

Next prime after 2 is 3. Let's see if 3²=9 divides any n⁴ +1.

Compute n⁴ mod 9. Let's see n=1: 1+1=2 mod9. n=2: 16 +1=17 mod9= -1. n=3: 81 +1=82 mod9=1. n=4: 256 +1=257 mod9: 257 /9=28*9=252, 257-252=5. So 5. n=5: 625 +1=626 mod9: 626-69*9=626-621=5. Hmm, n=5 is same as n=4. Similarly, n=6: 1296 +1=1297 mod9: 1297-144*9=1297-1296=1. So 1. So, the residues mod9 for n⁴ +1 are 2, -1,1,5,5,1, etc. So 0 mod9 is not achieved. So 9 doesn't divide any n⁴ +1. So p can't be 3.

Next prime is 5. Let's check if 25 divides n⁴ +1.

Compute n⁴ mod25. Let's see n=1: 1+1=2 mod25. n=2: 16 +1=17 mod25. n=3: 81 +1=82 mod25=82-3*25=82-75=7. n=4: 256 +1=257 mod25=257-10*25=257-250=7. Wait, 256 mod25: 25*10=250, 256-250=6, so 6+1=7. n=5: 625 +1=626 mod25=626-25*25=626-625=1. So 1. n=6: 6⁴=1296 mod25: 1296 /25=51*25=1275, 1296-1275=21. So 21 +1=22 mod25. n=7: 7⁴=2401 mod25: 2401 -96*25=2401-2400=1. So 1 +1=2. n=8: 8⁴=4096 mod25: 4096-163*25=4096-4075=21. So 21 +1=22. n=9: 9⁴=6561 mod25. 6561 /25=262*25=6550. 6561-6550=11. 11+1=12 mod25. Hmm, none of these give 0. Wait, so is 25 ever a divisor of n⁴ +1?

Wait, perhaps I should look for n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25. Let me see if such an n exists.

We can note that for modulus 25, the multiplicative group is cyclic of order 20. So, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod25. Let's compute the possible x.

But maybe it's easier to compute n⁴ mod25 for n from 1 to 24. Since 25 is small, it's manageable.

Wait, n=1: 1. n=2: 16. n=3: 81 mod25=6. n=4: 256 mod25=6. n=5: 0. n=6: 6⁴=1296 mod25=21. n=7: 2401 mod25=1. n=8: 4096 mod25=21. n=9: 6561 mod25=11. n=10: 0. n=11: 14641 mod25: 14641 -585*25=14641-14625=16. n=12: 12⁴=20736 mod25=20736-829*25=20736-20725=11. n=13: 28561 mod25=28561-1142*25=28561-28550=11. n=14: 14⁴=38416 mod25: 38416-1536*25=38416-38400=16. n=15: 0. n=16: 16⁴=65536 mod25=65536-2621*25=65536-65525=11. n=17: 83521 mod25=83521-3340*25=83521-83500=21. n=18: 18⁴=104976 mod25=104976-4199*25=104976-104975=1. n=19: 19⁴=130321 mod25=130321-5212*25=130321-130300=21. n=20: 0. n=21: 21⁴=194481 mod25=194481-7779*25=194481-194475=6. n=22: 22⁴=234256 mod25=234256-9370*25=234256-234250=6. n=23: 23⁴=279841 mod25=279841-11193*25=279841-279825=16. n=24: 24⁴=331776 mod25=331776-13271*25=331776-331775=1.

Wait, looking for x⁴ ≡ -1 mod25. So, we need x⁴ ≡24 mod25. Let's see if any n⁴ mod25 is 24. Looking through the above, n=1:1, n=2:16, n=3:6, n=4:6, n=5:0, n=6:21, n=7:1, n=8:21, n=9:11, n=10:0, n=11:16, n=12:11, n=13:11, n=14:16, n=15:0, n=16:11, n=17:21, n=18:1, n=19:21, n=20:0, n=21:6, n=22:6, n=23:16, n=24:1.

None of the x⁴ mod25 is 24. So, there's no solution for x⁴ ≡ -1 mod25. Therefore, 25 does not divide n⁴ +1 for any n. So p can't be 5.

Next prime is 7. Let's check if 49 divides n⁴ +1 for any n.

Alternatively, first check if 7 divides n⁴ +1. Let me see, for n=1: 2 mod7. n=2: 16 +1=17 mod7=3. n=3:81 +1=82 mod7= 82-11*7=82-77=5. n=4:256 +1=257 mod7: 257-36*7=257-252=5. n=5:625 +1=626 mod7: 626-89*7=626-623=3. n=6:1296 +1=1297 mod7: 1297-185*7=1297-1295=2. So, for n=1 to 6, n⁴ +1 mod7 is 2,3,5,5,3,2. So, none of them are 0 mod7. Wait, does 7 divide n⁴ +1? It seems not. Because 7 is 3 mod4, or 3 mod something? Wait, 7 is 3 mod4, but that might not matter. Alternatively, perhaps the multiplicative order of n modulo 7 is a factor.

Wait, the multiplicative group mod7 is cyclic of order 6. So, the order of any element divides 6. So, if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod7, then (n⁴)^2 ≡1 mod7, so n^8≡1 mod7. So, the order of n divides 8, but since the group order is 6, the order must divide gcd(8,6)=2. So, the order is 1 or 2. If the order is 1, then n≡1 mod7. Then n⁴≡1 mod7. So 1 ≡-1 mod7? That would mean 2≡0 mod7, which is false. If the order is 2, then n²≡1 mod7, so n≡±1 mod7. Then n⁴≡1 mod7, again leading to 1≡-1 mod7, which is false. So, there's no n with n⁴ ≡-1 mod7. Therefore, 7 can't be a prime such that 7² divides n⁴ +1 because even 7 doesn't divide n⁴ +1.

So, p=7 is out.

Next, p=13. Let's check if 13²=169 divides n⁴ +1 for some n. But first, does 13 divide n⁴ +1 for any n?

Compute n⁴ mod13. Let's see, 13 is 1 mod4? Wait, 13 is 1 mod4, so the multiplicative group is cyclic of order 12. So, the equation x⁴ ≡-1 mod13.

Let me check if -1 is a quartic residue mod13. Hmm, since 13 is 1 mod4, the multiplicative group is cyclic order 12. The possible orders of elements are divisors of 12. So, the equation x⁴ = -1. The order of -1 is 2, since (-1)^2=1 mod13. So, the equation x⁴ = -1 implies that x^8=1. So, the order of x must divide 8 and 12. So, the order divides gcd(8,12)=4. So, the order is 1,2,4.

If x has order 4, then x^4=1, but that's not -1. So, maybe x^2=-1. Let's see: x^2 ≡-1 mod13. Are there solutions?

Yes, for p=13, -1 is a quadratic residue because 13 ≡1 mod4. So, solutions to x² ≡-1 mod13 are x=5 and x=8 because 5²=25≡25-2*13= -1 mod13, and 8²=64≡64-4*13=64-52=12≡-1 mod13. So, x=5 and x=8 satisfy x²≡-1 mod13. So, if I take x=5, then x²= -1, so x⁴=1. Similarly, x=8: x²=-1, x⁴=1. So, x⁴≡1≡-1 mod13? Wait, that's only if 1≡-1 mod13, which is not true. So, no solution for x⁴≡-1 mod13. So, 13 doesn't divide n⁴ +1 for any n. Therefore, p can't be 13.

Next prime is 17. Let's check p=17. First, does 17 divide n⁴ +1 for some n? Let's see, compute n⁴ mod17.

17 is 1 mod4, so the multiplicative group is cyclic of order 16. So, equation x⁴ ≡-1 mod17. Let's see if there's a solution.

The order of x must divide 16, since the group is cyclic of order 16. Since x⁴ ≡-1, then x^8 ≡1 mod17. So, the order of x divides 8 but not 4, because x^4≡-1 ≠1. So, the order must be 8.

So, there must be elements of order 8 in the multiplicative group mod17. Since 16 is the group order, and 8 divides 16, yes, there are elements of order 8.

So, let's find an x such that x⁴ ≡-1 mod17.

Let me test some small numbers.

n=2: 16 mod17=16. 2⁴=16≡-1 mod17. Oh, so 2⁴ ≡-1 mod17. So, yes, 17 divides 2⁴ +1=17. So, n=2 is a solution for p=17. So, 17 divides 2⁴ +1.

But the question is whether 17² divides n⁴ +1 for some n. So, we need to find n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod17²=289.

So, the problem reduces to solving n⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

We know that n=2 is a solution mod17, so perhaps we can use Hensel's lemma to lift this solution to mod289.

Hensel's lemma says that if f(n) ≡0 mod p and f'(n) not ≡0 mod p, then there's a unique lift modp².

Here, f(n)=n⁴ +1. f'(n)=4n³.

At n=2 mod17: f'(2)=4*(8) mod17=32 mod17=15≡-2 mod17. Since 15 is not 0 mod17, Hensel's lemma applies, so there's a unique lift of n=2 mod17 to a solution mod289.

So, we need to find n=2 +17k such that (2 +17k)^4 ≡-1 mod289.

Let me compute (2 +17k)^4 mod289.

First, expand (2 +17k)^4 using the binomial theorem.

= 2^4 + 4*(2^3)*(17k) + 6*(2^2)*(17k)^2 + 4*(2)*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

Compute each term mod289.

2^4=16.

4*(8)*(17k)=4*8*17k=544k. 544 mod289: 289*1=289, 544-289=255. So 544k mod289=255k.

6*(4)*(17k)^2=24*(289k²)=24*289k². But 289k² is 0 mod289, so this term is 0 mod289.

Similarly, the other terms with (17k)^3 and (17k)^4 are multiples of 17^3 and 17^4, which are 0 mod289.

So, (2 +17k)^4 ≡16 +255k mod289.

We need this ≡-1 mod289. So, 16 +255k ≡-1 mod289.

Which implies 255k ≡-17 mod289.

Simplify: 255k ≡272 mod289.

Now, 255 and 289: let's compute gcd(255,289).

289 ÷255=1, remainder 34.

255 ÷34=7, remainder 17.

34 ÷17=2, remainder 0. So, gcd is17.

So, 255=17*15, 272=17*16, 289=17*17.

So, the equation is 15k ≡16 mod17.

15 mod17=15, 16 mod17=16.

Solve 15k ≡16 mod17.

15 and17 are coprime, so inverse of15 mod17 exists. 15*? ≡1 mod17.

15*1=15≡15

15*2=30≡13

15*3=45≡11

15*4=60≡60-3*17=60-51=9

15*5=75≡75-4*17=75-68=7

15*6=90≡90-5*17=90-85=5

15*7=105≡105-6*17=105-102=3

15*8=120≡120-7*17=120-119=1.

Ah, so inverse of15 is8 mod17.

So, k ≡16*8 mod17.

16*8=128. 128 mod17: 17*7=119, 128-119=9. So, k≡9 mod17.

So, k=9 +17m, where m is integer.

Therefore, the solution is n=2 +17k=2 +17*(9 +17m)=2 +153 +289m=155 +289m.

So, the minimal positive solution is n=155 mod289.

Wait, but is 155 the minimal positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by 17²=289? Let me check.

Compute 155⁴ +1 mod289.

But 155 mod289 is 155, but perhaps it's better to compute 155 mod17 first.

155 ÷17=9*17=153, 155-153=2. So, 155≡2 mod17, which is consistent with our initial solution.

But to compute 155⁴ mod289, maybe we can use the fact that 155=2 +17*9.

So, as before, (2 +17*9)^4 ≡16 +255*(9) mod289.

Compute 255*9=2295. 2295 mod289: 289*7=2023, 2295-2023=272. So, 255*9≡272 mod289.

So, 16 +272=288≡-1 mod289.

Yes, so 155⁴ ≡-1 mod289. So, 155⁴ +1≡0 mod289. So, m=155 is the minimal solution.

But wait, is there a smaller m than 155 that satisfies m⁴ +1 ≡0 mod289?

Because 155 is quite large. Let me check if perhaps a smaller n exists. For example, maybe n=2 +17*1=19.

Compute 19⁴ +1 mod289.

19⁴ can be computed as (19²)². 19²=361. 361 mod289=361-289=72. So, 72²=5184. 5184 mod289: Let's divide 5184 by289.

289*17=4913. 5184 -4913=271. So, 72²=5184≡271 mod289.

So, 19⁴=271 mod289. Then, 271 +1=272≡-17 mod289. Not 0.

Similarly, n=2 +17*2=36.

Compute 36⁴ mod289.

36²=1296. 1296 mod289: 289*4=1156. 1296-1156=140. So, 36²≡140 mod289.

Then, 140²=19600. 19600 mod289: Let's compute how many times 289 fits into 19600.

289*67=289*(60+7)=17340 +2023=19363. 19600-19363=237.

So, 36⁴≡237 mod289. 237 +1=238≡238 mod289. Not 0.

n=2 +17*3=53.

Compute 53⁴ mod289.

53²=2809. 2809 mod289: 289*9=2601. 2809-2601=208. So, 53²≡208 mod289.

208²=43264. 43264 mod289: Let's compute 289*149=?

Well, 289*100=28900, 289*40=11560, 289*9=2601. So 289*149=289*(100+40+9)=28900+11560+2601=43061.

43264-43061=203. So, 53⁴≡203 mod289. 203 +1=204≡204 mod289. Not 0.

n=2 +17*4=70.

Compute 70⁴ mod289.

70²=4900. 4900 mod289: Compute 289*16=4624. 4900-4624=276. So, 70²≡276 mod289.

276²=76176. 76176 mod289: Let's find 289*263=?

289*200=57800, 289*60=17340, 289*3=867. So 289*263=57800+17340+867=76007.

76176-76007=169. So, 70⁴≡169 mod289. 169 +1=170≡170 mod289. Not 0.

n=2 +17*5=87.

Compute 87⁴ mod289.

87²=7569. 7569 mod289: 289*26=7514. 7569-7514=55. So, 87²≡55 mod289.

55²=3025. 3025 mod289: 289*10=2890. 3025-2890=135. So, 87⁴≡135 mod289. 135 +1=136≡136 mod289. Not 0.

n=2 +17*6=104.

Compute 104⁴ mod289.

104²=10816. 10816 mod289: Let's compute 289*37=10693. 10816-10693=123. So, 104²≡123 mod289.

123²=15129. 15129 mod289: 289*52=15028. 15129-15028=101. So, 104⁴≡101 mod289. 101 +1=102≡102 mod289. Not 0.

n=2 +17*7=121.

Compute 121⁴ mod289.

121²=14641. 14641 mod289: Let's find 289*50=14450. 14641-14450=191. So, 121²≡191 mod289.

191²=36481. 36481 mod289: 289*126= 289*(100+20+6)=28900+5780+1734=36414. 36481-36414=67. So, 121⁴≡67 mod289. 67 +1=68≡68 mod289. Not 0.

n=2 +17*8=138.

Compute 138⁴ mod289.

138²=19044. 19044 mod289: 289*65=18785. 19044-18785=259. 259 is less than 289, so 138²≡259 mod289.

259²=67081. 67081 mod289: Let's compute 289*232=289*(200+30+2)=57800+8670+578=67048. 67081-67048=33. So, 138⁴≡33 mod289. 33 +1=34≡34 mod289. Not 0.

n=2 +17*9=155.

Compute 155⁴ mod289 as earlier step gave us 155⁴≡-1 mod289. So, 155⁴ +1≡0 mod289. So, m=155 is the minimal positive integer.

Wait, but 155 is quite large. Could there be a smaller n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod289?

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the fact that in the multiplicative group mod289, which is cyclic of order 17²-1=288. So, the order is 288.

We are looking for elements of order 8 in this group because x⁴ ≡-1 implies x^8≡1. So, the order of x must be 8. So, the number of solutions is φ(8)=4.

So, there should be four solutions to x⁴ ≡-1 mod289. We found n=155, but maybe there are smaller ones.

Wait, let me try n=17 -155? Wait, 17-155 is negative, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps n=155 -289= -134, but that's negative. So, the smallest positive is 155.

Alternatively, maybe I can use another approach to find a smaller solution.

Wait, let's compute m=155. Is there a smaller m?

Wait, let me try n=17*10 +2=172. Wait, n=172 is larger than 155, so not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe n=155 is indeed the smallest. Let me check other residues.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me check n=155⁴ mod289 again.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that 155 is congruent to 2 mod17, and using the lifting, it's indeed the minimal solution. So, perhaps m=155 is the minimal positive integer.

But that seems quite large. Maybe I made a mistake in the Hensel lifting step.

Wait, let's go back. When we computed (2 +17k)^4 ≡16 +255k mod289. We set 16 +255k ≡-1 mod289, which gives 255k ≡-17 mod289, which is 255k ≡272 mod289.

We found k≡9 mod17, so k=9 +17m. So, n=2 +17*9=155 +17*17*m=155 +289m.

So, the minimal positive solution is 155. So, I think that's correct.

Thus, p=17 is the least prime such that p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n. And the minimal m is 155.

Wait, but wait, I thought maybe there's a smaller prime. Let me think. Earlier, I skipped 17, but 17 is the first prime where p ≡1 mod8, which is necessary for solutions to x⁴ ≡-1 modp. So, p=17 is the least such prime. So, the answer is p=17, and m=155.

Wait, but wait, the question says "the least prime number p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by p²." So, p=17 is the least such prime. Then, find the least m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by p²=289. Which is 155.

So, I think the answer is m=155.

The least prime \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some positive integer \( n \) is \( p = 17 \). To find the minimal \( m \), we solve \( m^4 \equiv -1 \mod{289} \) using Hensel's lemma, lifting the solution \( n = 2 \mod{17} \) to \( n = 155 \mod{289} \). Thus, the least positive integer \( m \) is \( 155 \).

\boxed{155}
