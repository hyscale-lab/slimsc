Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, the hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, I know that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The rhombus ABCD has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. That means that each vertex of the rhombus is symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if one vertex is at point (a, b), another should be at (-a, -b), and so on. But wait, a rhombus has four vertices, so maybe each pair of opposite vertices are symmetric across the origin.

Wait, the problem says the diagonals intersect at the origin, so that must mean that the diagonals are straight lines passing through the origin. So, the diagonals are like lines that go through the origin, and each vertex is on one of these diagonals.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular to each other. So, if one diagonal is along a certain line through the origin, the other is along a line perpendicular to that. For example, one diagonal could be along the x-axis, and the other along the y-axis.

But wait, in a hyperbola, points are symmetric about both axes. So, if the rhombus has its diagonals along the axes, then the four vertices of the rhombus would lie on the hyperbola. So, points A, B, C, D would be on the hyperbola, and the diagonals would be the x-axis and y-axis.

Wait no, that might not necessarily be the case. Because the hyperbola's equation is x²/20 - y²/24 =1, so it's symmetric with respect to both axes and the origin. So, if the rhombus's diagonals are along the axes, the four points would be symmetric across both axes.

Alternatively, the diagonals could be along other lines through the origin, not necessarily the coordinate axes. So, perhaps if the diagonals are not aligned with the axes, the rhombus is rotated.

But regardless, since the rhombus is defined with its diagonals intersecting at the origin, the vertices will be points (a, b), (-a, b), (-a, -b), (a, -b)... Wait, no, that's a rectangle. For a rhombus, the vertices are such that the diagonals are perpendicular. So, if the diagonals are lines y = m x and y = -1/m x, for some slope m, then the four points would lie on these lines.

But in any case, all four points lie on the hyperbola.

So, the question is to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, BD is one of the diagonals, and we need to find the infimum of BD², but the question says the greatest number less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, so perhaps BD² can be made arbitrarily close to some limit, and we're to find that limit.

Alternatively, perhaps BD can vary, but we need the maximum lower bound for BD², meaning the minimum possible BD² across all such rhombi.

Wait, the question says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, it's the supremum of the lower bounds. So, if there is a lower bound L such that BD² > L for all rhombi, then the greatest such L is the answer.

So, we need to find the maximum value of L such that BD² > L for any rhombus ABCD as described.

So, perhaps I should parameterize the rhombus. Let me think. Suppose that the rhombus has diagonals AC and BD intersecting at the origin. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so AC ⊥ BD.

Moreover, since all four vertices lie on the hyperbola, we can model this by choosing two points on the hyperbola such that the line connecting them is a diagonal, and then the other two points are on the perpendicular line at the origin.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of parametric coordinates.

Let me consider that the diagonals are lines through the origin with slopes m and -1/m, since they're perpendicular.

So, let's take point A on the hyperbola lying on the line y = m x. Then, point C, being the opposite vertex, would be (-x, -y), but since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and the diagonals are perpendicular, if one diagonal is y = m x, the other would be y = -1/m x.

Wait, actually, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, say AC, lying on y = m x, and points B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal, lying on y = -1/m x.

So, let's parameterize points A and C as (a, m a) and (-a, -m a), respectively. Similarly, points B and D would be (b, (-1/m) b) and (-b, (1/m) b), respectively.

But since points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, substituting these into the hyperbola equation should satisfy it.

So, substituting point A into the hyperbola equation:

(a)² / 20 - (m a)² / 24 = 1.

Which simplifies to (a²)/20 - (m² a²)/24 = 1.

Similarly, for point B:

(b)² / 20 - ((-1/m) b)² / 24 = 1.

Which simplifies to (b²)/20 - ( (1/m²) b² ) /24 = 1.

So, now we have two equations:

1. a² (1/20 - m² /24) = 1
2. b² (1/20 - 1/(24 m²)) = 1

So, let me write that as:

a² = 1 / (1/20 - m² /24 )

and

b² = 1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m²) )

Hmm, so we can express a² and b² in terms of m.

But let's see: let's simplify the denominators.

For a²: 1/20 - m²/24 = (6 - 5 m²) / (120). So,

a² = 1 / ( (6 -5 m²)/120 ) = 120 / (6 -5 m² )

Similarly, for b²: 1/20 - 1/(24 m²) = (6 m² -5)/(120 m² )

So,

b² = 1 / ( (6 m² -5)/(120 m²) ) = (120 m² ) / (6 m² -5 )

So, now, the diagonals AC and BD have lengths 2a and 2b, respectively. Wait, no, wait: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, the lengths of the diagonals are AC = 2a (since A is (a, m a) and C is (-a, -m a), so the distance between A and C is sqrt( (2a)^2 + (2 m a)^2 ) = 2a sqrt(1 + m²) )

Wait, no, wait: if A is (a, m a) and C is (-a, -m a), then AC is the distance between (a, m a) and (-a, -m a). So, the distance AC is sqrt( (a - (-a))² + (m a - (-m a))² ) = sqrt( (2a)^2 + (2 m a)^2 ) = 2a sqrt(1 + m² )

Similarly, the other diagonal BD connects (b, (-1/m) b) and (-b, (1/m) b ). So, the distance BD is sqrt( (b - (-b))² + ( (-1/m) b - (1/m) b )² ) = sqrt( (2b)^2 + ( (-2/m b ) )² ) = 2b sqrt(1 + 1/m² )

So, the lengths of the diagonals are AC = 2a sqrt(1 + m² ) and BD = 2b sqrt(1 + 1/m² )

Therefore, BD² is (2b sqrt(1 + 1/m² ))² = 4 b² (1 + 1/m² )

Similarly, AC² is 4 a² (1 + m² )

But in the problem, we are to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, perhaps we need to find the infimum of BD², which would be the minimum possible BD², and thus the greatest lower bound would be that minimum value.

Wait, but the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, that would be the infimum of BD² across all possible rhombi.

So, our goal is to find the minimum possible BD², and that would be the greatest lower bound.

So, we can write BD² = 4 b² (1 + 1/m² )

But from earlier, b² = (120 m² ) / (6 m² -5 )

So, substituting:

BD² = 4 * (120 m² / (6 m² -5 )) * (1 + 1/m² )

Simplify the expression:

First, note that 1 + 1/m² = (m² +1)/m²

So, BD² = 4 * (120 m² / (6 m² -5 )) * ( (m² +1)/m² )

Simplify further:

The m² in the numerator and denominator cancel out:

BD² = 4 * 120 * (m² +1) / (6 m² -5 )

So, BD² = (480 (m² +1 )) / (6 m² -5 )

So, now, we can think of BD² as a function of m², let's let t = m². Since m is a real number (slope), t must be positive, and we must have the denominators in a² and b² to be positive, so:

From a²: 6 -5 m² > 0 ⇒ 6 >5 m² ⇒ m² <6/5 ⇒ t <6/5

From b²: 6 m² -5 >0 ⇒6 m² >5 ⇒ m² >5/6 ⇒ t>5/6

So, t must be in (5/6, 6/5)

So, t is between 5/6 and 6/5.

So, BD² as a function of t is (480 (t +1 )) / (6 t -5 )

We can write this as f(t) = 480(t +1)/(6t -5), with t ∈ (5/6, 6/5)

We need to find the minimum value of f(t) on this interval, since BD² must be greater than that minimum for all t in that interval. So, the infimum of BD² across all possible rhombi is the minimum value of f(t) on (5/6, 6/5).

To find the minimum of f(t), we can take the derivative of f(t) with respect to t and set it to zero.

So, f(t) = 480(t +1)/(6t -5)

Let me compute f'(t):

First, f'(t) = 480 [ (6t -5)(1) + (t +1)(6) ] / (6t -5)^2

Wait, no, that's the derivative using the quotient rule.

Wait, the quotient rule is [numerator derivative * denominator - numerator * denominator derivative] / denominator squared.

Wait, so f(t) = 480 * (t + 1) / (6t -5). So, f'(t) = 480 [ (1)(6t -5) - (t +1)(6) ] / (6t -5)^2

Simplify numerator:

= 480 [ (6t -5 -6t -6) ] / (6t -5)^2

= 480 [ (-5 -6) ] / (6t -5)^2

= 480 (-11) / (6t -5)^2

= -5280 / (6t -5)^2

So, f'(t) = -5280 / (6t -5)^2

Now, since t is in (5/6, 6/5), 6t -5 is positive because t >5/6, so 6t -5 >0, so denominator is positive, and squared is positive. So, f'(t) is negative throughout the interval.

This means that f(t) is decreasing on the interval (5/6, 6/5). Therefore, the minimum of f(t) occurs at the right endpoint of the interval, i.e., at t =6/5.

Wait, but as t approaches 6/5 from below, 6t -5 approaches 6*(6/5) -5 = 36/5 -25/5 =11/5. So, at t=6/5, 6t -5 = 11/5.

Wait, but wait, t approaches 6/5, but t can't actually reach 6/5 because at t=6/5, 6t-5=6*(6/5)-5=36/5 -25/5=11/5, which is positive. Wait, no, wait, 6t -5 at t=6/5 is 6*(6/5) -5=36/5 -25/5=11/5, which is greater than zero. So, t can actually reach t=6/5.

Wait, but wait, when t=6/5, then m²=6/5, so m= sqrt(6/5) or -sqrt(6/5). So, it's allowed.

Wait, but if t=6/5, then 6t -5=6*(6/5) -5=36/5 -25/5=11/5. So, f(t)=480*(6/5 +1)/(11/5)=480*(11/5)/(11/5)=480*1=480.

Wait, no, wait: t=6/5, so f(t)=480*(t +1)/(6t -5)=480*(6/5 +1)/(6*(6/5)-5)=480*(11/5)/(36/5 -25/5)=480*(11/5)/(11/5)=480*1=480.

Similarly, at t=5/6, t=5/6, so f(t)=480*(5/6 +1)/(6*(5/6)-5)=480*(11/6)/(5 -5)=480*(11/6)/0. Wait, but denominator is zero when t=5/6. So, t=5/6 is the lower limit, but as t approaches 5/6 from above, f(t) tends to infinity.

Wait, but earlier, we found that f'(t) is always negative, so f(t) is decreasing on (5/6,6/5). Therefore, the minimum value of f(t) occurs at t=6/5, which is 480.

Wait, but when t approaches 5/6, f(t) approaches infinity, and at t=6/5, f(t)=480.

So, the function f(t) is decreasing from infinity to 480 as t goes from 5/6 to 6/5.

Therefore, the minimum value of BD² is 480, achieved when t=6/5.

But the question is asking for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, since the minimum BD² is 480, then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480, because BD² can be as small as 480, but not smaller.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if BD² can be as small as 480, then for all rhombi, BD² ≥480, so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480 itself, because BD² is always ≥480.

Wait, but the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, if BD² can be as small as 480, then no number greater than 480 can be less than BD² for all rhombi. So, the greatest such number would be 480, since for any number greater than 480, there exists a rhombus where BD² is exactly 480, so it's not less than BD².

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.

If BD² can be as small as 480, then BD² ≥480. So, for any number L <480, there exists a rhombus where BD²=480, so L <480 < BD². But for L=480, it's equal to BD² for that rhombus, so 480 is not less than BD². Therefore, the greatest number L such that L < BD² for all rhombi would be 480, because if you take L=480, it's not less than BD² (since for that rhombus BD²=480), but if you take L=480 - ε for any ε>0, then L would be less than BD² for all rhombi.

Wait, but in our case, the minimal BD² is 480. So, the infimum is 480, but BD² can't be less than 480. So, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480, because for any L greater than 480, there exists a rhombus with BD²=480, so L would not be less than BD² for all rhombi.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the question. It says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, if BD² can be as small as 480, then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480, because any number greater than 480 would not satisfy the condition for the rhombus where BD²=480.

Wait, but that would mean that the answer is 480. But let me check if that makes sense.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier calculation. Let me re-examine the BD² function.

Wait, when t approaches 6/5, f(t) approaches 480. So, the minimal BD² is 480. So, the infimum is 480, which is achievable when t=6/5.

Therefore, the greatest number L such that L < BD² for all rhombi would be 480, because for any L greater than 480, there's a rhombus with BD²=480, so L cannot be greater than 480.

Wait, no, wait, if BD² can be as small as 480, then for all rhombi, BD² is ≥480. So, the greatest number L such that L < BD² for all rhombi is 480, because L must be less than every BD², which are all ≥480. So, the maximum possible L is 480, because if you take L=480, it's not less than BD² (since BD² can be 480). But if you take L=480, then for any rhombus with BD²=480, L is not less than BD². Therefore, the correct L is the supremum of all lower bounds, which is 480, but since BD² can't be less than 480, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative.

Wait, earlier, I found that f'(t) = -5280/(6t -5)^2, which is always negative for t >5/6, so f(t) is decreasing on (5/6,6/5). Therefore, the minimal value of f(t) is at t=6/5, which is 480, and the maximum is at t approaching 5/6, which tends to infinity.

So, BD² can take any value from 480 to infinity. So, the minimal BD² is 480, and it can be as large as desired.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480, because BD² is always ≥480. So, 480 is the greatest lower bound, and thus the answer is 480.

Wait, but maybe I should check with specific values.

Let me take t=6/5, so m²=6/5. Then, m=√(6/5). So, points A and C are on y=√(6/5)x.

So, a²=120/(6 -5*(6/5))=120/(6-6)=120/0, which is undefined. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, when t=6/5, 6t -5=6*(6/5)-5=36/5 -25/5=11/5, which is positive, so b²=120 m²/(6 m²-5)=120*(6/5)/(6*(6/5)-5)=120*(6/5)/(36/5 -25/5)=120*(6/5)/(11/5)=120*(6/5)*(5/11)=120*6/11=720/11.

So, then BD²=4 b² (1 + 1/m² )

Wait, m²=6/5, so 1/m²=5/6. So, 1 +1/m²=1 +5/6=11/6.

So, BD²=4*(720/11)*(11/6)=4*(720/11)*(11/6)=4*720/6=4*120=480.

Yes, that checks out.

So, if I take t=6/5, BD²=480.

If I take t approaching 5/6 from above, then m² approaches 5/6, so 6t-5 approaches 0, making b²=120 m²/(6m²-5) approach infinity. So, BD² approaches infinity as t approaches 5/6 from above.

So, BD² can be made as large as desired, but the minimal BD² is 480.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480, because BD² is always at least 480. So, 480 is the infimum, and thus the greatest lower bound.

Wait, but the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, that would be the infimum of BD², which is 480.

Wait, but the infimum is 480, which is attainable. So, yes, 480 is the minimal possible BD², so it's the greatest lower bound.

Therefore, the answer is 480.

Wait, but let me check with another value, say t=1.

At t=1, m²=1, so m=1.

Then, a²=120/(6 -5*1)=120/1=120, so a=±√120.

Similarly, b²=120*1/(6*1 -5)=120/1=120, so b=±√120.

Then, BD²=4*(120)*(1 +1/1)=4*120*2=960.

Which is greater than 480, as expected since f(t) is decreasing.

Another point, say t=2 (but wait, t must be less than 6/5=1.2, so t=2 is outside the domain.)

Wait, but t must be in (5/6, 6/5), so t=1.1 is allowed.

At t=1.1, m²=1.1, so m=√1.1.

Then, a²=120/(6 -5*1.1)=120/(6-5.5)=120/0.5=240.

b²=120*1.1/(6*1.1 -5)=132/(6.6-5)=132/1.6=82.5.

Then, BD²=4*82.5*(1 +1/(1.1))=4*82.5*(2.1/1.1)=4*82.5*(21/11).

Wait, compute 82.5*(21/11)=82.5*(2.1/1.1)=82.5*(21/11)= (82.5 ÷11)*21=7.5*21=157.5.

Then, BD²=4*157.5=630.

Which is more than 480, as expected since f(t) is decreasing.

So, when t approaches 6/5=1.2 from below, BD² approaches 480.

Thus, the minimal BD² is indeed 480, so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves finding the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all rhombi \( ABCD \) inscribed in the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \), with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

1. **Hyperbola and Rhombus Properties**:
   - The hyperbola is centered at the origin, opening along the x-axis.
   - The rhombus \( ABCD \) has diagonals intersecting at the origin, implying symmetry with respect to both axes.
   - The diagonals are perpendicular, and all vertices lie on the hyperbola.

2. **Parametrization of Points**:
   - Points \( A \) and \( C \) lie on a line through the origin with slope \( m \), parameterized as \( (a, ma) \) and \( (-a, -ma) \).
   - Points \( B \) and \( D \) lie on a perpendicular line through the origin with slope \( -1/m \), parameterized as \( (b, (-1/m)b) \) and \( (-b, (1/m)b) \).

3. **Substituting into Hyperbola Equation**:
   - Substituting \( (a, ma) \) into the hyperbola equation gives \( a^2 = \frac{120}{6 - 5m^2} \).
   - Substituting \( (b, (-1/m)b) \) into the hyperbola equation gives \( b^2 = \frac{120m^2}{6m^2 - 5} \).

4. **Diagonal Lengths**:
   - The lengths of the diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) are expressed in terms of \( a \) and \( b \).
   - \( BD^2 = 4b^2 \left(1 + \frac{1}{m^2}\right) \).

5. **Simplifying \( BD^2 \)**:
   - Substituting \( b^2 \) into \( BD^2 \) gives \( BD^2 = \frac{480(m^2 + 1)}{6m^2 - 5} \).
   - Let \( t = m^2 \), so \( BD^2 = \frac{480(t + 1)}{6t - 5} \), with \( t \in (\frac{5}{6}, \frac{6}{5}) \).

6. **Finding the Minimum \( BD^2 \)**:
   - The function \( f(t) = \frac{480(t + 1)}{6t - 5} \) is analyzed.
   - The derivative \( f'(t) = -\frac{5280}{(6t - 5)^2} \) is negative, indicating \( f(t) \) is decreasing on \( (\frac{5}{6}, \frac{6}{5}) \).
   - The minimum value occurs at \( t = \frac{6}{5} \), yielding \( BD^2 = 480 \).

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The minimum value of \( BD^2 \) is 480, which is the greatest lower bound for \( BD^2 \) across all such rhombi.

The final answer is \(\boxed{480}\).
