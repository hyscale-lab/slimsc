Okay, so I've got this problem here: there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but let me try to break this down.

First, let me write down the equations as given:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I remember that logarithms have some useful properties. Specifically, log_b(a^c) is equal to c * log_b(a). So maybe I can apply that here.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Using the power rule for logarithms, that becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. 

Wait, if I let log_x(y) = a, then the first equation becomes x * a = 10. But I also know that log_x(y) can be expressed in terms of natural logarithms as ln(y)/ln(x). So maybe that's another way to approach it.

Similarly, looking at the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Again, applying the power rule, that becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Hmm, so I have two equations now:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

I notice that log_x(y) and log_y(x) are reciprocals of each other. Because log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, if I let log_x(y) = a, then log_y(x) = 1/a. 

So substituting that into the equations:

1. x * a = 10
2. 4y * (1/a) = 10

So now I have a system of two equations with two variables, x and y, but they're in terms of a as well. Maybe I can solve for a first.

From equation 1: x = 10 / a.

From equation 2: 4y / a = 10 => y = (10 * a) / 4 = (5a)/2.

So now I have x and y in terms of a: x = 10/a and y = (5a)/2.

But I also know that log_x(y) = a. Since log_x(y) = a means that x^a = y.

Wait, let me write that down: x^a = y.

But we have expressions for x and y in terms of a. So substitute x = 10/a and y = (5a)/2 into that equation.

So, (10/a)^a = (5a)/2.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to make it easier.

Taking ln on both sides:

ln[(10/a)^a] = ln[(5a)/2]

Using the power rule again on the left side: a * ln(10/a) = ln(5a/2)

So, a * [ln(10) - ln(a)] = ln(5a/2)

Let me expand the right side as well: ln(5a/2) = ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2)

So putting it all together:

a * [ln(10) - ln(a)] = ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2)

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe I can rearrange terms.

Let me distribute the a on the left:

a * ln(10) - a * ln(a) = ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2)

Bring all terms to the left side:

a * ln(10) - a * ln(a) - ln(5) - ln(a) + ln(2) = 0

Combine like terms:

a * ln(10) - (a + 1) * ln(a) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0

This is a transcendental equation, which probably doesn't have a solution in terms of elementary functions. Maybe I can make an intelligent guess for the value of a.

Let me see if a is an integer. Let me test a=2.

Plugging a=2 into the equation:

2 * ln(10) - (2 +1)*ln(2) - ln(5) + ln(2) =

2 ln(10) - 3 ln(2) - ln(5) + ln(2)

Simplify:

2 ln(10) - 2 ln(2) - ln(5)

I can compute this numerically.

ln(10) ≈ 2.302585, ln(2)≈0.693147, ln(5)≈1.609438.

So:

2*(2.302585) ≈4.605170

2*(0.693147) ≈1.386294

So 4.605170 -1.386294 -1.609438 ≈4.605170 -2.995732 ≈1.609438

Which is about 1.609438, which isn't zero. So a=2 doesn't satisfy the equation.

How about a=1?

Plug a=1:

1*ln(10) - (1+1)ln(1) - ln(5) + ln(2)

But ln(1)=0, so:

ln(10) -0 - ln(5) + ln(2)

Which is ln(10) - ln(5) + ln(2) = ln(2) + ln(2) = 2 ln(2) ≈1.386, which is not zero.

Hmm, maybe a=3?

a=3:

3 ln(10) -4 ln(3) - ln(5) + ln(2).

Compute numerically:

3*(2.302585) ≈6.907755

4*(1.098612) ≈4.39445

So 6.907755 -4.39445 -1.609438 +0.693147

Compute step by step:

6.907755 -4.39445 = 2.513305

2.513305 -1.609438 = 0.903867

0.903867 +0.693147 ≈1.597014

Not zero. Hmm.

What about a=1.5? Let's compute that.

a=1.5:

1.5 ln(10) - (2.5) ln(1.5) - ln(5) + ln(2)

Compute each term:

1.5 *2.302585 ≈3.4538775

ln(1.5)=0.405465, so 2.5*0.405465≈1.01366

ln(5)=1.609438, ln(2)=0.693147.

Putting it all together:

3.4538775 -1.01366 -1.609438 +0.693147

Compute step by step:

3.4538775 -1.01366 ≈2.4402175

2.4402175 -1.609438 ≈0.8307795

0.8307795 +0.693147≈1.5239265

Still not zero. Maybe a= something else.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter substitution or manipulation.

Let me go back to the original equations.

We have:

log_x(y^x)=10 => x log_x(y) =10.

Similarly, log_y(x^{4y})=10 =>4y log_y(x)=10.

But since log_y(x) = 1/log_x(y) =1/a, so equation 2 is 4y*(1/a)=10 => y= (10 a)/4= (5a)/2.

So now, from equation 1: x*a=10 => x=10/a.

We also have y= (5a)/2.

Now, recall that log_x(y)=a, which implies that x^a = y.

So, substituting x=10/a and y=5a/2 into x^a = y:

(10/a)^a =5a/2.

So, let me take both sides and raise them to the power of 1/a to see if that helps.

Wait, (10/a)^a =5a/2.

Alternatively, perhaps taking logarithms again.

Take natural log of both sides:

a ln(10/a) = ln(5a/2)

Which is:

a (ln10 - ln a) = ln5 + ln a - ln2

So, same as before: a ln10 - a ln a = ln5 + ln a - ln2

Hmm, maybe rearrange terms:

a ln10 - a ln a - ln5 - ln a + ln2 =0

So, group terms with a:

a (ln10 - ln a) - (ln5 + ln a - ln2) =0

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, maybe factor out ln a:

Wait, let's see:

a ln10 - a ln a - ln5 - ln a + ln2 =0

= a ln10 - (a +1) ln a - ln5 + ln2=0

This is similar to what I had before.

Hmm, perhaps I can think of this as a function f(a) and try to find its root.

Let me define f(a) = a ln10 - (a +1) ln a - ln5 + ln2

We need to find a>0 such that f(a)=0.

We attempted a=2, a=1, a=3, a=1.5, and it didn't work.

Let me try a=5/2=2.5.

Compute f(2.5):

2.5 ln10 ≈2.5 *2.302585≈5.75646

(a+1)=3.5, so 3.5 ln(2.5)≈3.5 *0.916291≈3.20702

ln5≈1.60944, ln2≈0.693147.

So f(2.5)=5.75646 -3.20702 -1.60944 +0.693147

Compute step by step:

5.75646 -3.20702=2.54944

2.54944 -1.60944=0.94

0.94 +0.693147≈1.633147>0

Still positive. Hmm.

What about a=4?

f(4)=4 ln10 -5 ln4 -ln5 +ln2

Compute each term:

4*2.302585≈9.21034

5*ln4≈5*1.386294≈6.93147

So 9.21034 -6.93147 -1.60944 +0.693147

Compute step by step:

9.21034 -6.93147≈2.27887

2.27887 -1.60944≈0.66943

0.66943 +0.693147≈1.36257>0

Still positive. Hmm.

Wait, when a increases, what happens to f(a)?

Let me think about the behavior as a approaches infinity.

As a→infinite, the term a ln10 dominates, because it's linear in a, while the other terms are either logarithmic or constants. So f(a)→infinite.

At a approaching zero from the right, let's see:

a ln10 approaches 0,

-(a+1) ln a: as a→0+, ln a→-infty, so -(a+1) ln a → +infty,

Then -ln5 +ln2 is a constant.

So f(a) approaches +infty as a→0+.

Wait, so at a=1, f(1)= ln10 -2 ln1 -ln5 +ln2= ln10 - (ln5 - ln2)= ln(10) - ln(5/2)= ln(10/(5/2))= ln(4)≈1.386>0.

At a=2, f(a)= approx 1.609>0.

Wait a=0.5.

f(0.5)=0.5 ln10 -1.5 ln0.5 -ln5 +ln2

Compute each term:

0.5 *2.302585≈1.15129

1.5 *ln0.5≈1.5*(-0.693147)≈-1.03972

ln5≈1.60944, ln2≈0.693147

So f(0.5)=1.15129 - (-1.03972) -1.60944 +0.693147

Which is 1.15129 +1.03972 =2.19101

2.19101 -1.60944=0.58157

0.58157 +0.693147≈1.2747>0

Still positive. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, when a=1, f(a)= ln10 -2 ln1 -ln5 +ln2. But ln1=0, so f(1)= ln10 - ln5 + ln2= ln(10) - ln(5) + ln(2)=ln( (10)/(5) *2 )=ln(4)≈1.386>0.

Wait, so f(a) is positive at a=0.5, 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, etc. So maybe f(a) is always positive? But that can't be, because at a=0.5, it's positive, and as a approaches infinity, it's positive, and a approaches zero, it's positive. Hmm, but we are getting f(a)=0, so maybe I made a mistake in my earlier reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.

Let me go back.

We started with:

From equation 1: x log_x(y)=10 => x * a =10, so x=10/a.

From equation 2: 4y log_y(x)=10 =>4y*(1/a)=10 => y= (10 a)/(4)=5a/2.

Then, since log_x(y)=a, so x^a = y.

So substituting x=10/a and y=5a/2 into x^a=y:

(10/a)^a =5a/2.

So, that's correct.

Taking log of both sides:

a ln(10/a) = ln(5a/2).

Which is equivalent to a (ln10 - ln a) = ln5 + ln a - ln2.

So that's correct. So the equation is:

a ln10 - a ln a = ln5 + ln a - ln2.

So f(a)=a ln10 -a ln a -ln5 - ln a + ln2.

Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach.

Let me assume that a is 2, as I tried earlier.

Wait, when a=2, f(a)= 2 ln10 -2 ln2 -ln5 + ln2.

Which is 2 ln10 - (2 ln2 -ln2) -ln5 = 2 ln10 - ln2 -ln5.

Which is 2 ln10 - ln(2*5)=2 ln10 - ln10= ln10≈2.302585, which is not zero.

So no, a=2 is not a solution.

Wait, but how about if a= something else. Maybe a= (5/2)?

Wait, similar to y=5a/2, if a=2, y=5, x=5. Hmm, but x and y have to be greater than 1, so that's possible. But when a=2, we saw that f(a)= ln10 ≈2.302585≠0.

Hmm, perhaps let's try a= (ln something). Maybe set a= ln something.

Wait, another approach: Let me set t = ln a.

Then, the equation is:

a ln10 -a ln a - ln5 - ln a + ln2 =0

Express in terms of t:

a ln10 -a t - ln5 - t + ln2=0

Hmm, but a is still in terms of t, since t=ln a.

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe if I let u = a ln10 and v= a ln a.

Wait, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can write the equation as:

a(ln10 - ln a) = ln(5a/2 )

Which is the original equation.

So, a (ln(10/a)) = ln(5a/2)

Hmm, maybe express both sides in terms of exponentials.

Let me define both sides as exponents.

Let me set left side as e^{ln(10/a)*a} = (10/a)^a

Similarly, right side is e^{ln(5a/2)}

So, (10/a)^a =5a/2

Wait, but that's exactly the same as before.

Hmm, perhaps take both sides and write in terms of base 10.

Wait, 10 is the base. Hmm.

Wait, (10/a)^a =5a/2.

If I take both sides to the power of 1/a:

10/a = (5a/2)^{1/a}

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let me write 10/a as 10 * (1/a), but not helpful.

Wait, maybe take log base 10 of both sides.

log10[(10/a)^a] = log10(5a/2)

Left side: a log10(10/a) = a [1 - log10 a]

Right side: log10(5a/2) = log10 5 + log10 a - log10 2

Set equal:

a [1 - log10 a] = log10 5 + log10 a - log10 2

Let me denote log10 a = b.

So, a (1 - b) = log10 5 + b - log10 2

But a = 10^b, since a=10^b.

So, substitute a=10^b:

10^b (1 - b) = log10 5 - log10 2 + b

Hmm, let me compute log10 5 and log10 2.

log10 5≈0.69897, log10 2≈0.30103.

So, log10 5 - log10 2≈0.69897 - 0.30103≈0.39794.

So equation becomes:

10^b (1 - b) = 0.39794 + b

Hmm, this seems a bit more manageable.

So, 10^b (1 - b) - b = 0.39794

Let me define this as f(b)=10^b (1 - b) - b -0.39794=0

We can try to find b that satisfies f(b)=0.

Let me test b=0:

f(0)=1*(1 -0) -0 -0.39794=1 -0.39794≈0.60206>0

b=0.5:

10^{0.5}=sqrt(10)≈3.1623.

So, f(0.5)=3.1623*(1 -0.5) -0.5 -0.39794≈3.1623*0.5=1.58115 -0.5=1.08115 -0.39794≈0.68321>0

b=1:

10^1=10

f(1)=10*(1-1) -1 -0.39794=0 -1 -0.39794≈-1.39794<0

Ah, so f(b) crosses zero between b=0.5 and b=1.

Because at b=0.5, f≈0.683>0; at b=1, f≈-1.398<0.

So, the root is between 0.5 and 1.

Let me try b=0.75.

10^0.75≈5.6234.

f(0.75)=5.6234*(1 -0.75) -0.75 -0.39794≈5.6234*0.25≈1.40585 -0.75=0.65585 -0.39794≈0.2579>0

Still positive. So root between 0.75 and 1.

Try b=0.8.

10^0.8≈6.3096.

f(0.8)=6.3096*(1-0.8) -0.8 -0.39794≈6.3096*0.2≈1.26192 -0.8=0.46192 -0.39794≈0.06398>0

Still positive, but close to zero.

Try b=0.85.

10^0.85≈10^{0.85}= approx 7.0794.

f(0.85)=7.0794*(1-0.85) -0.85 -0.39794≈7.0794*0.15≈1.06191 -0.85=0.21191 -0.39794≈-0.18603<0

So, now f(0.85)≈-0.186<0.

So the root is between b=0.8 and b=0.85.

Use linear approximation.

At b=0.8, f=0.06398.

At b=0.85, f=-0.186.

The change in f is -0.25 over an interval of 0.05 in b.

We need to find delta where f=0.

So, from b=0.8, need to go delta such that 0.06398 - (0.25/0.05)*delta=0.

Wait, the slope is ( -0.25 ) / (0.05 )= -5 per delta.

So, to go from 0.06398 to 0, delta= 0.06398 /5≈0.0128.

So approximate root at b≈0.8 +0.0128≈0.8128.

Check at b=0.8128.

10^0.8128≈10^{0.8128}= approx.

Compute 10^0.8≈6.3096, 10^0.01≈1.0233.

So, 10^{0.8128}=10^{0.8 +0.0128}=10^{0.8} *10^{0.0128}≈6.3096 *1.0299≈6.499.

f(0.8128)=6.499*(1 -0.8128) -0.8128 -0.39794.

Compute 1-0.8128=0.1872.

So, 6.499*0.1872≈1.214.

Then, 1.214 -0.8128=0.4012 -0.39794≈0.00326≈0.003>0.

Almost zero, but still positive. So, need to go a bit further.

Let me try b=0.815.

10^0.815≈10^{0.8 +0.015}=10^0.8 *10^0.015≈6.3096 *1.0353≈6.3096*1.035≈6.524.

f(0.815)=6.524*(1 -0.815) -0.815 -0.39794.

1-0.815=0.185.

6.524*0.185≈1.207.

1.207 -0.815=0.392.

0.392 -0.39794≈-0.00594≈-0.006<0.

So, at b=0.815, f≈-0.006.

So, the root is between b=0.8128 and 0.815.

Using linear approximation between these points:

At b=0.8128, f=0.003.

At b=0.815, f=-0.006.

The change in f is -0.009 over delta b=0.0022.

We need to find delta where f=0.

So, delta= 0.003 / (0.009 / 0.0022)= approximately 0.003 * (0.0022/0.009)=0.003 *0.244≈0.00073.

So, root≈0.8128 +0.00073≈0.8135.

So, approx b≈0.8135.

Thus, a=10^b≈10^{0.8135}.

Compute 10^{0.8135}.

We can use logarithm tables or approximate.

We know that:

10^{0.8}=6.3096,

10^{0.81}=10^{0.8 +0.01}=6.3096 *10^{0.01}≈6.3096 *1.0233≈6.456.

Similarly, 10^{0.8135}=10^{0.81 +0.0035}=6.456 *10^{0.0035}.

10^{0.0035}≈1 +0.0035*ln10≈1 +0.0035*2.3026≈1 +0.00806≈1.00806.

So, 6.456 *1.00806≈6.456 +6.456*0.00806≈6.456 +0.052≈6.508.

So a≈6.508.

Now, from earlier:

x=10/a≈10/6.508≈1.536.

y=5a/2≈5*6.508/2≈16.27.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Wait, a≈6.508.

x=10/a≈10/6.508≈1.536.

y=5a/2≈(5 *6.508)/2≈32.54/2≈16.27.

So, x≈1.536, y≈16.27.

But the problem asks for xy.

So, 1.536 *16.27≈?

1.536 *16=24.576.

1.536 *0.27≈0.41472.

Total≈24.576 +0.41472≈24.9907≈25.

Hmm, that's very close to 25.

Is the exact value 25?

Wait, maybe I approximated too much, but it's close to 25.

Wait, let me think. Maybe there's an exact solution where xy=25.

Because 25 is a nice number, and the approximated product is about 25.

So, perhaps the exact value is 25.

Let me see if assuming a is such that x*y=25.

Wait, from x=10/a and y=5a/2.

So, x*y= (10/a)*(5a/2)= (10*5a)/(2a)=50/2=25.

Wait, that's independent of a! So regardless of the value of a, xy=25.

So, the product is always 25.

Wait, so regardless of the value of a, the product x*y is 25.

So, the answer is 25.

So, I was overcomplicating it.

Because when I set up the equations, x=10/a and y=5a/2, the product is (10/a)*(5a/2)=25.

So, xy=25.

Wow, that's a much simpler way to see it.

I didn't need to solve for a. The product is always 25, regardless of the value of a.

The given equations are:

1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\)
2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\)

Using the power rule for logarithms, these can be rewritten as:

1. \(x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10\)
2. \(4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10\)

Let \(\log_x(y) = a\). Then, \(\log_y(x) = \frac{1}{a}\). Substituting into the equations:

1. \(x \cdot a = 10 \implies x = \frac{10}{a}\)
2. \(4y \cdot \frac{1}{a} = 10 \implies y = \frac{5a}{2}\)

Since \(\log_x(y) = a\), it follows that \(x^a = y\). Substituting \(x = \frac{10}{a}\) and \(y = \frac{5a}{2}\) into \(x^a = y\):

\[
\left(\frac{10}{a}\right)^a = \frac{5a}{2}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
a \cdot \ln\left(\frac{10}{a}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{5a}{2}\right)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
a (\ln 10 - \ln a) = \ln 5 + \ln a - \ln 2
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
a \ln 10 - a \ln a - \ln 5 - \ln a + \ln 2 = 0
\]

This equation is transcendental and does not have an elementary solution. However, we can observe that the product \(xy\) is independent of \(a\):

\[
xy = \left(\frac{10}{a}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{5a}{2}\right) = \frac{50a}{2a} = 25
\]

Thus, the product \(xy\) is always \(25\), regardless of the value of \(a\).

\(\boxed{25}\)
