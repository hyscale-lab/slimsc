Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: first, their sum is 300, and second, a quadratic expression involving them equals 6,000,000. Hmm, let's break it down.

The problem states:
a + b + c = 300
and
a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I think the first step is to understand what the second equation represents. It looks like a symmetric expression involving each variable squared multiplied by the other two. Let me see if I can factor this or rewrite it in a more manageable form.

Looking at the expression, I notice that it's symmetric in all three variables, which might suggest that factoring could help. Let me try to factor it:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the entire expression becomes:
a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Hmm, that seems a bit better. Now, since a + b + c = 300, maybe I can substitute that in. Let's see, because (b + c) = 300 - a, (a + c) = 300 - b, and (a + b) = 300 - c.

So substituting those into the expression, we get:
a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

Let me write that out:
= 300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³
= 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)

So, the second equation becomes:
300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I think I can write this as:
300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I wonder if there's a way to relate this to known identities or perhaps to express it in terms of symmetric sums. Let me recall that a³ + b³ + c³ can be written using the identity:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Given that a + b + c = 300, let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = ab + bc + ca, and Q = abc.

So, substituting into the expression for a³ + b³ + c³:

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3 S P + 3 Q.

So, let's compute S³: 300^3 = 27,000,000.

So, the expression becomes:
300(a² + b² + c²) - [27,000,000 - 3*300*P + 3Q] = 6,000,000.

Let me rearrange that:

300(a² + b² + c²) - 27,000,000 + 900 P - 3 Q = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay, now I need to express a² + b² + c² in terms of S, P, and maybe Q. I remember that:

a² + b² + c² = S² - 2P.

So substituting that in:

300(S² - 2P) - 27,000,000 + 900 P - 3 Q = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each term:

300*S² = 300*(300)^2 = 300*90,000 = 27,000,000.

300*(-2P) = -600 P.

So, putting it all together:

27,000,000 - 600 P - 27,000,000 + 900 P - 3 Q = 6,000,000.

Simplify the terms:

27,000,000 cancels with -27,000,000.

Then, we have (-600 P) + (900 P) = 300 P.

So, 300 P - 3 Q = 6,000,000.

So, 300 P - 3 Q = 6,000,000.

I can divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

100 P - Q = 2,000,000.

So, Q = 100 P - 2,000,000.

Hmm, so now I have Q expressed in terms of P. So, if I can find the possible values of P, then I can find Q accordingly.

But wait, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, P and Q must also be integers, and Q must be nonnegative because a, b, c are nonnegative. So, Q = 100 P - 2,000,000 ≥ 0.

So, 100 P ≥ 2,000,000 → P ≥ 20,000.

So, P is at least 20,000. Now, what's the maximum possible value of P? Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers summing to 300, the maximum occurs when two variables are as large as possible, and the third is zero.

Wait, actually, for nonnegative integers a, b, c, the maximum of ab + bc + ca occurs when two variables are as large as possible, but let's compute it.

Wait, the maximum of ab + bc + ca when a + b + c = 300.

I think the maximum occurs when two variables are 150 each and the third is 0. Let me check:

If a = b = 150, c=0, then ab + bc + ca = 150*150 + 0 + 0 = 22,500.

Wait, but 22,500 is way less than 20,000? Wait, no: 22,500 is greater than 20,000. Hmm, that's a problem because earlier we had P ≥ 20,000, but maximum P is 22,500.

Wait, no: 22,500 is 22.5k, which is more than 20k, so it's feasible. So P can be between 20,000 and 22,500.

Wait, but let's confirm: Suppose a = 300, b = 0, c = 0: P = 0.

But wait, the maximum P occurs when a and b are as large as possible. Wait, when a is 300, b=0, c=0: P=0.

Wait, no, that's the minimum. Wait, when a, b, c are as equal as possible, P is maximized.

Wait, for a + b + c = S, the maximum of ab + bc + ca is when a = b = c = S/3.

But since S = 300, which is divisible by 3, a = b = c = 100. Then, P = 100*100 + 100*100 + 100*100 = 3*10,000 = 30,000.

Wait, that's 30,000. So earlier when I thought maximum P is 22,500, that must have been incorrect.

Wait, let me compute when a = b = 150, c=0: ab + bc + ca = 150*150 + 0 + 0 = 22,500. But when a = b = c = 100, we get P = 30,000. So that's larger.

So, that's the maximum.

So, P can range from 0 up to 30,000. But in our case, P must be at least 20,000.

Wait, because Q = 100 P - 2,000,000 must be nonnegative. So Q ≥ 0 → 100 P - 2,000,000 ≥ 0 → P ≥ 20,000.

So P can be from 20,000 up to 30,000.

So, for each P in 20,000 to 30,000, we can have Q = 100 P - 2,000,000. But a, b, c must be nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300, ab + bc + ca = P, and abc = Q.

So now, the problem reduces to finding the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers such that:

1. a + b + c = 300,
2. ab + bc + ca = P,
3. abc = Q = 100 P - 2,000,000.

But how can I find such triples? I think the standard approach is to consider that the variables are the roots of a cubic equation.

Let me think: If a, b, c are roots of the equation x³ - Sx² + Px - Q = 0, where S = 300, P is known, and Q is determined by P as above.

So the equation is:

x³ - 300 x² + P x - (100 P - 2,000,000) = 0.

Simplifying, that's:

x³ - 300 x² + P x - 100 P + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, maybe factor this in terms of P.

Let me group terms with P:

x³ - 300 x² + 2,000,000 + P (x - 100) = 0.

So, for each P, the equation would have roots a, b, c. But since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, the equation must factor into (x - a)(x - b)(x - c) = 0.

But given that, perhaps I can find for each P, whether the equation can be satisfied with integer roots.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to express a, b, c in terms that make the equations easier.

Alternatively, perhaps I can try substituting variables.

Wait, let's note that in the equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

But I also know that a + b + c = 300, so maybe I can write a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 300² - 2P.

So, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2P.

Substituting back into the equation:

300*(90,000 - 2P) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Wait, but we already used this earlier, so perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can use the earlier expression for a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of S, P, Q.

So, from earlier, a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3 S P + 3 Q.

So, substituting into the equation:

300*(90,000 - 2P) - [27,000,000 - 3*300*P + 3 Q] = 6,000,000.

Which simplifies as we did before to 300 P - 3 Q = 6,000,000 → 100 P - Q = 2,000,000 → Q = 100 P - 2,000,000.

So, that gives us the relationship between Q and P.

But I'm not sure if that helps me count the number of triples.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the problem in terms of variables a, b, and c. Since a + b + c = 300, perhaps some symmetry can be exploited.

Wait, let me consider that a, b, c are nonnegative integers. So, maybe I can fix one variable and express the others in terms of it.

Let me fix a, then b + c = 300 - a. Then, the expression a²(b + c) becomes a²*(300 - a). Similarly, the term b²(a + c) would be b²*(300 - b), but since a + c = 300 - b, that's b²*(300 - b). Similarly for c²*(300 - c).

Wait, but perhaps that's not the most straightforward approach. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Wait, this can be rewritten as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

But since b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c, as before, so substituting:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

So, the expression is equal to 6,000,000.

But maybe I can write this as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Which brings me back to the same equation as before.

Hmm. I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should approach this differently.

I think perhaps I can consider the equation 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000, along with a + b + c = 300, and try to manipulate them to find a relationship.

Let me subtract the equation for a³ + b³ + c³ from 300(a² + b² + c²) to get 6,000,000.

Wait, but another thought: Maybe I can write this as:

300(a² + b² + c²) = (a³ + b³ + c³) + 6,000,000.

Which can be rearranged as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this expression differently.

Wait, let's consider that a³ - 300 a² is part of each term. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express each term as a²(300 - a). So, 300 a² - a³, etc.

Yes, so sum over a, b, c: (300 a² - a³) = 6,000,000.

So, 300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Which is the same as before.

I wonder if I can find a relationship between a, b, and c. Maybe if two variables are equal, or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the function f(x) = 300x² - x³. Let me see what this function looks like.

f(x) = x² (300 - x). It's a cubic function that starts at 0 when x=0, rises to a maximum, and then decreases back to 0 at x=300.

The maximum occurs at x = 150, because the derivative f’(x) = 600x - 3x² = 3x(200 - x), which is zero at x=0 and x=200. Wait, wait, but f(200) = 200²*(300-200) = 40,000 * 100 = 4,000,000.

Wait, but wait, the maximum of f(x) is at x = 200, because f(200) = 4,000,000. Wait, but when x=150, f(150) = 150^2 * 150 = 22500 * 150 = 3,375,000, which is less than 4,000,000. So the maximum is at x=200.

Hmm, so each term 300x² - x³ is maximum at x=200, with the value of 4,000,000.

Wait, but in our problem, the sum of these terms for a, b, c is 6,000,000. So each term contributes up to 4,000,000, but in our case, the sum is 6,000,000.

Wait, so if all three variables are 200, then the sum would be 3 * 4,000,000 = 12,000,000, which is way larger than 6,000,000. So perhaps the variables are smaller.

Wait, but let's think: If one variable is 200, then the other two variables sum to 100, so their contributions would be 300x² - x³ for x=100, which is 300*10,000 - 1,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000 each, so two variables would contribute 2,000,000 each, and the third would contribute 4,000,000. The total would be 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 8,000,000, which is more than 6,000,000.

Hmm, so maybe having two variables at 200 is too much.

Wait, perhaps the variables are all equal. Let me test that.

If a = b = c = 100, since 100*3=300. Then each term would be 300*(100)^2 - (100)^3 = 300*10,000 - 1,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000. So sum of three such terms would be 6,000,000, which matches our equation.

So that's a solution: a = b = c = 100.

Now, but the problem is asking for the number of triples, so maybe there are other solutions as well.

Wait, perhaps other variables can be arranged such that the sum is 6,000,000. For example, maybe two variables are 100 and the third is 100, but that's the same as the case above. Alternatively, perhaps two variables are 150 and the third is 0. Let me check that.

If a = 150, b = 150, c = 0. Then:

300*(150)^2 - (150)^3 = 300*22,500 - 3,375,000 = 6,750,000 - 3,375,000 = 3,375,000.

So two variables at 150 contribute 3,375,000 each, and the third contributes zero. So the total sum would be 3,375,000 + 3,375,000 + 0 = 6,750,000, which is higher than 6,000,000. So that's too much.

Hmm, perhaps if one variable is 200, and the other two sum to 100, but maybe one of them is 100 and the other is 0.

Wait, let's try a=200, b=100, c=0.

Then, 300*(200)^2 - (200)^3 = 300*40,000 - 8,000,000 = 12,000,000 - 8,000,000 = 4,000,000.

300*(100)^2 - (100)^3 = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000.

300*(0)^2 - (0)^3 = 0.

So sum is 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 0 = 6,000,000. That works! So (200,100,0) is a solution, and so are all permutations of this.

So, for example, (200,100,0), (200,0,100), (100,200,0), (100,0,200), (0,200,100), (0,100,200). So that's 6 permutations.

Similarly, when all three are 100, that's another solution, but it's only one unique case because all variables are equal.

Wait, but wait, are there other solutions besides these? Hmm.

Wait, let's see: Let me consider a=200, b=100, c=0. That gives the sum as 6,000,000. Similarly, if I take a=200, b=50, c=50, what happens?

Compute 300*(200)^2 - 200^3 = 4,000,000.

For b=50: 300*50^2 -50^3 = 300*2500 - 125,000 = 750,000 - 125,000 = 625,000.

Same for c=50: 625,000.

So total sum would be 4,000,000 + 625,000 + 625,000 = 5,250,000, which is less than 6,000,000. So that doesn't work.

Hmm, so perhaps the only solutions are when two variables are 100 and 200, and the third is 0, but wait, in the case where a=200, b=100, c=0, the sum is correct.

Wait, but also, when a=100, b=100, c=100, the sum is correct.

Are there any other possibilities?

Wait, let's try a=150, b=150, c=0: sum is 3,375,000 + 3,375,000 + 0 = 6,750,000, which is more than 6,000,000. So that doesn't work.

What about a=180, b=120, c=0?

Compute:

300*(180)^2 - 180^3 = 300*32,400 - 5,832,000 = 9,720,000 - 5,832,000 = 3,888,000.

300*(120)^2 - 120^3 = 300*14,400 - 1,728,000 = 4,320,000 - 1,728,000 = 2,592,000.

300*(0)^2 - 0^3 = 0.

Sum: 3,888,000 + 2,592,000 = 6,480,000, which is more than 6,000,000.

Hmm, so that's too high.

Wait, maybe a=160, b=140, c=0.

300*(160)^2 -160^3 = 300*25,600 - 4,096,000 = 7,680,000 - 4,096,000 = 3,584,000.

300*(140)^2 -140^3 = 300*19,600 - 2,744,000 = 5,880,000 - 2,744,000 = 3,136,000.

Sum: 3,584,000 + 3,136,000 = 6,720,000, which is more than 6,000,000.

Hmm, still too high.

Wait, maybe a=200, b=50, c=50. Wait, I tried that earlier and it was 5,250,000, which is less than 6,000,000.

Wait, perhaps a=200, b=75, c=25.

Compute:

300*(200)^2 - 200^3 = 4,000,000.

300*(75)^2 - 75^3 = 300*5,625 - 421,875 = 1,687,500 - 421,875 = 1,265,625.

300*(25)^2 -25^3 = 300*625 - 15,625 = 187,500 - 15,625 = 171,875.

Sum: 4,000,000 + 1,265,625 + 171,875 = 5,437,500, which is less than 6,000,000.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps a=200, b=100, c=0 is the only case where one variable is 200, another is 100, and the third is 0. Are there other cases where two variables are non-zero besides 200 and 100?

Wait, let me try a=150, b=100, c=50.

Compute each term:

300*(150)^2 -150^3 = 300*22,500 - 3,375,000 = 6,750,000 - 3,375,000 = 3,375,000.

300*(100)^2 -100^3 = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000.

300*(50)^2 -50^3 = 750,000 - 125,000 = 625,000.

Sum: 3,375,000 + 2,000,000 + 625,000 = 6,000,000.

Oh, this also works! So (150,100,50) is another solution. Now, and all permutations of this.

So, how many permutations are there for (150,100,50)? Well, since all three numbers are distinct, the number of permutations is 3! = 6.

Thus, so far, we have two types of solutions:

1. All three variables are 100: (100,100,100). Only one such triple.

2. One variable is 200, another is 100, and the third is 0. There are 6 permutations of this.

3. Another solution where a=150, b=100, c=50, and its permutations: 6 permutations.

Wait, but let me check if (150,100,50) is the only such triple with distinct numbers. Or are there others?

Wait, let me try another combination. Let's say a=120, b=120, c=60.

Compute each term:

300*(120)^2 -120^3 = 300*14,400 - 1,728,000 = 4,320,000 - 1,728,000 = 2,592,000.

Same for the second 120: 2,592,000.

300*(60)^2 -60^3 = 300*3,600 - 216,000 = 1,080,000 - 216,000 = 864,000.

Sum: 2,592,000 + 2,592,000 + 864,000 = 6,048,000, which is more than 6,000,000. So that's too high.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps I can model the problem as follows. Let me consider that the equation is linear in each variable when others are fixed. But I'm not sure.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can exploit the fact that the variables are nonnegative integers and use inequalities.

Wait, let me think: Since a + b + c = 300, and all are nonnegative integers, the maximum possible value for any variable is 300.

Now, looking back at the expression 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

We can write this as sum_{x=a,b,c} (300x² - x³) = 6,000,000.

So each term 300x² - x³ must be non-negative because x is a nonnegative integer, and 300x² - x³ = x²(300 - x) ≥ 0 when x ≤ 300, which is always true.

So each term is non-negative, which is good because their sum is 6,000,000.

Now, perhaps I can find all possible x such that 300x² - x³ is a certain value, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Let's consider that 300x² - x³ = x²(300 - x).

I can think of this as a function f(x) = x²(300 - x). Then, for each x, f(x) is known.

We saw earlier that f(100) = 2,000,000, f(150) = 3,375,000, f(200) = 4,000,000.

So, for our problem, since the sum of f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000, and each f(x) is nonnegative, we can look for triples where the sum of their f(x) is exactly 6,000,000.

We already found that (100,100,100) gives 2,000,000 each, summing to 6,000,000.

We also found that (200,100,0) gives 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 0 = 6,000,000.

Another solution is (150,100,50), which gives 3,375,000 + 2,000,000 + 171,875 = 6,000,000.

Wait, let me check that again:

Wait, 300*(150)^2 - (150)^3 = 300*22500 - 3375000 = 6,750,000 - 3,375,000 = 3,375,000.

300*(100)^2 - (100)^3 = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000.

300*(50)^2 - (50)^3 = 750,000 - 125,000 = 625,000.

Wait, adding these up: 3,375,000 + 2,000,000 + 625,000 = 6,000,000. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that (150,100,50) gives 6,000,000, but when I calculated, I got 3,375,000 + 2,000,000 + 625,000 = 6,000,000. So that's correct.

Wait, but earlier when I had a=150, b=100, c=50, the sum was indeed 6,000,000. So that's another solution.

Now, are there other solutions besides these?

Let me think: Suppose two variables are 100, and the third is 100, which gives the sum as 6,000,000.

Another case is when one variable is 200, another 100, and the third 0.

Another case is when variables are 150, 100, 50.

Are there any other triplets where the sum of f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000?

Let me think of another possibility. Let's consider a=120, b=120, c=60.

Wait, f(120) = 120²*(300 - 120) = 14,400 * 180 = 2,592,000.

So two variables at 120 would give 2,592,000 each, and c=60: f(60) = 60²*(300 - 60) = 3,600 * 240 = 864,000.

So sum would be 2,592,000 + 2,592,000 + 864,000 = 6,048,000, which is more than 6,000,000. So that's too high.

Wait, perhaps trying a=130, b=100, c=70.

f(130) = 130²*170 = 16,900 * 170 = 2,873,000.

f(100) = 2,000,000.

f(70) = 70²*230 = 4,900*230 = 1,127,000.

Sum: 2,873,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,127,000 = 6,000,000. That's exactly 6,000,000.

So another solution is (130,100,70) and its permutations.

Hmm, so that's another set. Let me confirm the computation.

f(130) = 130^2*(300 - 130) = 16,900 * 170.

Let me compute 16,900 * 170:

16,900 * 100 = 1,690,000.

16,900 * 70 = 1,183,000.

So total is 1,690,000 + 1,183,000 = 2,873,000.

f(100) is 2,000,000.

f(70) = 70^2*(300-70) = 4,900 * 230.

4,900 * 200 = 980,000.

4,900 * 30 = 147,000.

Total: 980,000 + 147,000 = 1,127,000.

Sum: 2,873,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,127,000 = 6,000,000. Correct.

So, that's another solution: (130,100,70) and its permutations.

Wait, so how many permutations are there for (130,100,70)? Since all are distinct, 3! = 6 permutations.

Hmm, this suggests that there might be more solutions than I initially thought.

Wait, perhaps I can find more such triplets by varying the numbers.

Wait, let me try a=140, b=100, c=60.

f(140) = 140²*160 = 19,600*160 = 3,136,000.

f(100) = 2,000,000.

f(60) = 60²*240 = 3,600*240 = 864,000.

Sum: 3,136,000 + 2,000,000 + 864,000 = 6,000,000. Yes, that works.

So another solution is (140,100,60) and its permutations.

Similarly, let's try a=110, b=110, c=80.

f(110) = 110²*190 = 12,100 * 190 = 2,299,000.

Two variables at 110: 2,299,000 each.

f(80) = 80²*220 = 6,400 * 220 = 1,408,000.

Sum: 2,299,000 + 2,299,000 + 1,408,000 = 6,006,000, which is more than 6,000,000.

Hmm, over by 6,000.

Wait, perhaps a=110, b=120, c=70.

f(110) = 2,299,000.

f(120) = 2,592,000.

f(70) = 1,127,000.

Sum: 2,299,000 + 2,592,000 + 1,127,000 = 6,018,000, which is still over.

Hmm, perhaps trying a=125, b=100, c=75.

f(125) = 125²*175 = 15,625 * 175.

Let me compute that: 15,625 * 100 = 1,562,500; 15,625 * 75 = 1,171,875. So total f(125) = 1,562,500 + 1,171,875 = 2,734,375.

f(100) = 2,000,000.

f(75) = 75²*225 = 5,625 * 225 = 1,265,625.

Sum: 2,734,375 + 2,000,000 + 1,265,625 = 6,000,000. Exactly. So another solution is (125,100,75) and its permutations.

So, this suggests that there are multiple solutions where the triplet includes 100 along with other numbers. Hmm, so perhaps all triplets where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200.

Wait, wait, because a + b + c = 300, so if one variable is 100, the other two sum to 200.

So, perhaps, for any x and y such that x + y = 200, the triplet (100, x, y) will satisfy the equation.

Wait, let's test that. Let me suppose that a = 100, then b + c = 200.

Then, f(a) = 100²*(300 - 100) = 10,000 * 200 = 2,000,000.

f(b) = b²*(300 - b).

f(c) = c²*(300 - c).

But since c = 200 - b, we can write f(c) = (200 - b)^2*(300 - (200 - b)) = (200 - b)^2*(100 + b).

So, the sum becomes:

f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 2,000,000 + [b²*(300 - b)] + [(200 - b)^2*(100 + b)].

We need this sum to equal 6,000,000, so:

[b²*(300 - b)] + [(200 - b)^2*(100 + b)] = 4,000,000.

Let me expand the terms:

First term: b²*(300 - b) = 300 b² - b³.

Second term: (200 - b)^2*(100 + b).

First, expand (200 - b)^2: 40,000 - 400b + b².

Multiply by (100 + b): (40,000 - 400b + b²)(100 + b).

Let me compute this step by step.

= 40,000*(100) + 40,000*b - 400b*100 - 400b*b + b²*100 + b²*b.

= 4,000,000 + 40,000b - 40,000b - 400b² + 100b² + b³.

Simplify:

4,000,000 + (40,000b - 40,000b) + (-400b² + 100b²) + b³.

= 4,000,000 + 0b + (-300b²) + b³.

So, the second term is 4,000,000 - 300b² + b³.

So, the sum of the first and second terms is:

[300b² - b³] + [4,000,000 - 300b² + b³] = 4,000,000.

Yes, because -b³ + b³ cancels, 300b² - 300b² cancels, leaving 4,000,000.

So, regardless of the value of b, the sum of these two terms is always 4,000,000.

Therefore, for any b, when a=100, c=200 - b, the sum f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000.

Wait, that's interesting. So, any triplet where one of the variables is 100, and the other two sum to 200, will satisfy the equation.

But wait, that can't be right because earlier when I tried a=100, b=150, c=50, the sum was 6,000,000, and when I tried a=100, b=120, c=80, the sum was 6,000,000.

Wait, but when I tried a=100, b=100, c=100, the sum was 6,000,000 as well.

Wait, but let's think: if a=100, then regardless of what b and c are (as long as b + c=200), the sum f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000.

So, that suggests that all triplets where one variable is 100, and the other two sum to 200, will satisfy the equation.

But wait, earlier when I tried a=100, b=150, c=50, the sum of f(a) + f(b) + f(c) was 6,000,000. Similarly, a=100, b=200, c=0: sum was 6,000,000. Also, a=100, b=130, c=70: sum was 6,000,000.

So, that implies that any triplet where one variable is 100, and the other two sum to 200, is a solution.

Wait, but then that suggests that there are infinitely many solutions, but since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, the number of solutions would be the number of nonnegative integer pairs (b, c) such that b + c = 200.

Which is 201 solutions (from b=0, c=200 up to b=200, c=0).

But then, for each such pair, we can have triplets where a=100, b, and c=200 - b.

But wait, but in the problem statement, the variables are nonnegative integers. So, for each triplet where one variable is 100, and the other two sum to 200, that's a solution.

But earlier, when I tried a=130, b=100, c=70, that also worked, and a=140, b=100, c=60 worked.

Wait, but in all these cases, the variable a=100, but that's not necessarily the case. The triplet could have any permutation where one variable is 100, and the other two sum to 200.

Wait, but in the triplet (150,100,50), a=150, but then 150 + 50 + 100 = 300, so 150 and 50 sum to 200, but wait, no: 150 + 50 = 200, but a=150, b=100, c=50: a + c = 200, but b=100.

Wait, but the sum a + b + c is 300, so if one variable is 100, the other two must sum to 200. So, for any such triplet, the sum will satisfy the equation.

But does that mean that the number of solutions is the number of nonnegative integer solutions where one variable is 100, and the other two sum to 200?

Which would be 201 solutions, as b can range from 0 to 200, and c=200 - b.

Wait, but each such triplet (100, b, c) where b + c = 200 is a solution, and since the problem allows permutations, each such triplet can be permuted in different ways.

Wait, but wait, no. Because in the triplet (100, b, c), when we permute, we can have (b, 100, c), (b, c, 100), etc.

Wait, but if b and c are different, the number of permutations depends on whether they are distinct or not.

Wait, for example, in the case where a=100, b=100, c=100: only one unique triplet, as all are same.

In the case where a=100, b=200, c=0: the other two variables are 200 and 0, which are distinct, so the number of permutations is 3! = 6, because all three are distinct.

Wait, but wait, in this case, a=100, b=200, c=0: the variables are 100, 200, 0. So all three are distinct, so the number of permutations is 6.

But in the case where a=100, b=150, c=50: a=100, b=150, c=50: all distinct, so again 6 permutations.

Wait, but earlier when I thought that any triplet where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 would satisfy the equation, that would include all these possibilities.

But that would imply that the number of solutions is more than the cases I considered earlier.

But I think I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let me clarify: The problem is to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and the expression equals 6,000,000.

We found that if any one of a, b, c is 100, and the other two sum to 200, then the expression is satisfied.

Therefore, all such triplets are solutions.

So, the number of solutions would be the number of triplets where one variable is 100, and the other two sum to 200, multiplied by the number of permutations for each case.

Wait, but let's compute that.

Case 1: All three variables are 100. Only one such triplet: (100,100,100).

Case 2: Exactly one variable is 100, and the other two are distinct and sum to 200. For each such pair (x, y) where x + y = 200 and x ≠ y, the triplet (100, x, y) can be arranged in 6 ways (since all three are distinct). The number of such pairs is the number of ordered pairs where x ≠ y and x + y = 200.

Wait, but for x and y nonnegative integers, the number of ordered pairs is 201 (from x=0 to x=200). But since x and y are distinct, the number of unordered pairs is (201 - 1)/2 = 100. Because when x ≠ y, each unordered pair is counted twice in the ordered pairs.

Wait, no: The number of ordered pairs where x ≠ y and x + y = 200 is 200, because when x=0, y=200; x=1, y=199; up to x=199, y=1; x=200, y=0. So that's 201 ordered pairs, but when x ≠ y, each pair is counted twice except when x = y, which only occurs when 200 is even, which it's not. So all 201 ordered pairs have x ≠ y, except when x=y=100, but 200 is even, so x=100, y=100 is a solution, but x + y = 200. Wait, 100 + 100 = 200.

Wait, yes, that's correct. So, in the case where x + y = 200, the number of ordered pairs where x = y is 1 (x=100, y=100). The rest are 200 ordered pairs where x ≠ y, which can be grouped into 100 unordered pairs.

So, in our problem, when considering triplets where exactly one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200, the number of such triplets is as follows:

- If the other two variables are equal (x=y=100), then the triplet is (100,100,100), which we've already counted in Case 1.

- If the other two variables are distinct, then for each unordered pair {x, y}, we have 6 permutations of the triplet (100, x, y).

So, the number of such triplets is 100 unordered pairs × 6 permutations = 600.

But wait, but wait: When x and y are distinct, each triplet (100, x, y) can be arranged in 6 ways. So, for each of the 100 unordered pairs, we have 6 ordered triplets.

Wait, but let me think again: For x + y = 200, the number of ordered pairs where x ≠ y is 200. Each such ordered pair corresponds to a unique triplet (100, x, y), but since the triplet can be permuted, each unordered pair {x, y} with x ≠ y corresponds to 6 ordered triplets.

Wait, no. Wait, the triplet (100, x, y) can be permuted in 3! = 6 ways, but if x and y are distinct, then each permutation is unique.

So, for each of the 100 unordered pairs {x, y} where x ≠ y, there are 6 ordered triplets.

Thus, the number of triplets where exactly one variable is 100 and the other two are distinct and sum to 200 is 100 × 6 = 600.

Plus the triplet where all three are 100: 1.

Additionally, we have triplets where one variable is 100, another is 200, and the third is 0. Wait, but in this case, the triplet is (100, 200, 0), which is included in the 600 count above because 200 + 0 = 200 and 200 ≠ 0. So, each such triplet is counted in the 600.

Wait, but earlier I thought that (200,100,0) and its permutations are 6, which is part of the 600.

Wait, but in that case, the total number of solutions would be 1 (all 100s) + 600 (one 100, two distinct others summing to 200) = 601.

But wait, earlier when I found triplets like (150,100,50), I considered them as separate solutions, but actually, they are included in the 600 triplets where one variable is 100, and the other two sum to 200.

Wait, but then why did I find triplets like (130,100,70) and others also satisfying the equation? Because they are included in the 600.

So, according to this, the total number of triplets is 601.

Wait, but wait, let me check.

Wait, when I considered a=100, b=100, c=100, that's one triplet.

When I consider a=100, and the other two variables being any pair that sums to 200, whether they are equal or not, I get:

- One triplet where all are 100.

- 200 ordered triplets where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200, with x ≠ y.

But wait, 200 ordered triplets where a=100, b=x, c=y, with x + y = 200 and x ≠ y.

Each such triplet can be permuted in 3! = 6 ways, but since in each case, the 100 is fixed as one element, perhaps the number of unique permutations is 2 for each unordered pair.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to count all possible triplets where one variable is 100, and the other two sum to 200, regardless of their order.

So, the number of such triplets is the number of ordered triplets where one element is 100, and the other two are nonnegative integers summing to 200.

The number of such triplets is 3 × (number of ordered pairs (x, y) where x + y = 200).

Because the 100 can be in any of the three positions.

The number of ordered pairs (x, y) where x + y = 200 is 201 (from x=0 to x=200).

So, the number of ordered triplets where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 is 3 × 201 = 603.

But wait, this would include cases where the other two variables are both 100, which is the case (100,100,100), which is counted three times in this count (once in each position).

Wait, but that's incorrect because in reality, (100,100,100) is only one unique triplet, but in our count, it's counted three times, once for each position of 100.

So, to correct this, the total number would be 3 × 201 - 2 × 1 = 603 - 2 = 601.

Because we have 3 × 201 = 603 ordered triplets where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200, but the triplet (100,100,100) is counted three times in this total, so we subtract 2 to count it only once.

Thus, the total number of triplets is 601.

But earlier, when I found the triplet (100,100,100), that's one triplet, and then the other 600 are where one variable is 100, and the other two are distinct and sum to 200, each contributing 6 permutations.

Wait, but 601 is the total number according to this count.

But wait, let me think again: For each of the three positions of 100, the number of triplets is 201 (since the other two variables can be any x and y such that x + y = 200). So, 3 × 201 = 603.

But this includes the triplet (100,100,100) three times (once in each position), so we need to subtract the overcounts.

Each time we count (100,100,100), it's because one of the variables is in the 100 position, and the other two are 100 each. So, in our count of 3 × 201, (100,100,100) is counted three times. But it should be counted only once.

So, the correct total is 3 × 201 - 2 × 1 = 603 - 2 = 601.

Therefore, the total number of triplets is 601.

Wait, but earlier when I thought that triplets where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 are all solutions, that suggests that the answer is 601.

But wait, earlier when I tried a=150, b=100, c=50, that worked, and similarly for a=130, b=100, c=70, etc. So, all these are included in the 601.

But wait, let me make sure that all these triplets satisfy the original equation.

Wait, when a=100, and b + c = 200, then the sum f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000, as shown earlier.

So, this suggests that all such triplets are valid.

Thus, the total number of solutions is 601.

But wait, 601 seems a bit high. Let me check again.

Wait, the number of triplets where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 is 3 × 201 = 603, but subtract 2 because (100,100,100) is counted three times, so 603 - 2 = 601.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the answer should be 601.

But let me verify this with another approach.

Earlier, I found that when a=100, the sum of f(b) + f(c) is always 4,000,000, leading to the total sum being 6,000,000.

Thus, any triplet where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 is a solution.

Therefore, the number of such triplets is 601.

So, I think the answer is 601.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem requires finding the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a, b, c)\) such that \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\).

### Key Steps:

1. **Expression Simplification**:
   The given quadratic expression can be rewritten as:
   \[
   a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b)
   \]
   Using \(a + b + c = 300\), substitute \(b + c = 300 - a\), \(a + c = 300 - b\), and \(a + b = 300 - c\). This transforms the expression into:
   \[
   300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000
   \]

2. **Symmetric Sums**:
   Using the identities:
   \[
   a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc
   \]
   and
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)
   \]
   Substitute \(S = 300\), \(P = ab + bc + ca\), and \(Q = abc\) to derive:
   \[
   300(90,000 - 2P) - [27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q] = 6,000,000
   \]
   Simplifying leads to:
   \[
   300P - 3Q = 6,000,000 \implies 100P - Q = 2,000,000 \implies Q = 100P - 2,000,000
   \]

3. **Nonnegative Solutions**:
   Since \(Q \geq 0\), \(P \geq 20,000\). The maximum possible \(P\) is 30,000 when \(a = b = c = 100\).

4. **Counting Solutions**:
   - **Case 1**: \(a = b = c = 100\). Only one solution.
   - **Case 2**: One variable is 100, and the other two sum to 200. For each such pair \((x, y)\) where \(x + y = 200\), there are 6 permutations if all are distinct. However, when \(x = y = 100\), it's counted once. The number of ordered pairs \((x, y)\) is 201, but subtracting overcounts gives 601 solutions.

### Final Answer:
The number of such triples is \(\boxed{601}\).
