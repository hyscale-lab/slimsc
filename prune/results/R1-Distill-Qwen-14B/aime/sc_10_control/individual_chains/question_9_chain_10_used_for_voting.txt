Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to find the product xy where both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The given equations are:

log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) also equals 10.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember some properties that might help. Let me write down the equations first to get a clearer picture.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Second equation: log_y(x^(4y)) = 10.

I think I can use the power rule of logarithms here, which says that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So applying that to both equations.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Using the power rule, that becomes x * log_x(y) = 10.

Wait, so x times log base x of y equals 10. Hmm, log base x of y is the same as (ln y)/(ln x), right? Because log_b(a) = (ln a)/(ln b). So substituting that in:

x * (ln y / ln x) = 10.

But that's kind of complicated. Maybe I can let's say that log_x(y) is some variable to make it easier. Let me call it a.

So, let a = log_x(y). Then, the first equation becomes x * a = 10.

Similarly, looking at the second equation: log_y(x^(4y)) = 10.

Again, using the power rule, that's 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Wait, log_y(x) is the reciprocal of log_x(y), isn't it? Because log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, if a = log_x(y), then log_y(x) = 1/a.

So substituting that into the second equation, we get:

4y * (1/a) = 10.

So now we have two equations:

1. x * a = 10
2. (4y)/a = 10

Hmm, so from equation 1, we can express x in terms of a: x = 10 / a.

From equation 2, solving for y: 4y = 10a, so y = (10a)/4 = (5a)/2.

So now, x = 10/a and y = (5a)/2.

But since x and y are related through the original logarithmic equations, perhaps we can find a relationship between x and y. Let me think.

Wait, we also have that a = log_x(y). Since a is log_x(y), which is (ln y)/(ln x). So, a = (ln y)/(ln x).

But let's express ln y and ln x in terms of a.

We have x = 10/a, so ln x = ln(10/a) = ln(10) - ln(a).

Similarly, y = (5a)/2, so ln y = ln(5a/2) = ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2).

So, a = [ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2)] / [ln(10) - ln(a)].

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can manipulate it.

Let me write it as:

a * [ln(10) - ln(a)] = ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2)

Expanding the left side:

a * ln(10) - a * ln(a) = ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2)

Let me collect like terms.

Bring all terms to one side:

a ln(10) - a ln(a) - ln(5) - ln(a) + ln(2) = 0

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can factor some terms.

Looking at the terms:

= a ln(10) - a ln(a) - ln(5) - ln(a) + ln(2)

= a [ln(10) - ln(a)] - [ln(5) + ln(a)] + ln(2)

Wait, perhaps that's not helpful. Maybe I can think of ln(10) as ln(2*5) = ln(2) + ln(5). So let's substitute that in.

So, replacing ln(10) with ln(2) + ln(5):

= a [ln(2) + ln(5) - ln(a)] - [ln(5) + ln(a)] + ln(2)

Expanding the first term:

= a ln(2) + a ln(5) - a ln(a) - ln(5) - ln(a) + ln(2)

Now, let's group similar terms:

- Terms with ln(2): a ln(2) + ln(2) = ln(2)(a + 1)
- Terms with ln(5): a ln(5) - ln(5) = ln(5)(a - 1)
- Terms with ln(a): -a ln(a) - ln(a) = -ln(a)(a + 1)

So putting it all together:

ln(2)(a + 1) + ln(5)(a - 1) - ln(a)(a + 1) = 0

Hmm, maybe factor out (a + 1):

Wait, the first two terms have (a + 1) and (a - 1), but perhaps I can factor (a + 1) from the first and third terms.

Wait, let's see:

ln(2)(a + 1) - ln(a)(a + 1) + ln(5)(a - 1) = 0

So, factor (a +1):

= (a + 1)(ln(2) - ln(a)) + ln(5)(a - 1) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can write this as:

(a + 1)(ln(2) - ln(a)) = - ln(5)(a - 1)

Alternatively:

(a + 1)(ln(2) - ln(a)) + ln(5)(a - 1) = 0

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I can let’s make a substitution. Let me define t = a.

So, the equation becomes:

t ln(2) + t ln(5) - t ln(t) - ln(5) - ln(t) + ln(2) = 0

Wait, perhaps this isn't helpful. Maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let's step back and see if there's another approach. Maybe instead of dealing with natural logs, I can use the change of base formula and express everything in terms of a single base.

Alternatively, perhaps think in terms of exponents. Since I have expressions for x and y in terms of a, maybe I can express one in terms of the other.

Wait, from earlier, x = 10/a and y = (5a)/2.

So, perhaps I can express x in terms of y or vice versa.

Let me solve for a from one equation and substitute into another.

From x = 10/a, a = 10/x.

From y = (5a)/2, substitute a = 10/x:

y = (5*(10/x))/2 = (50)/(2x) = 25/x.

So, y = 25/x.

So, x * y = 25. Wait, is that possible?

Wait, let me check that. From x =10/a and y=5a/2.

If I multiply x and y: x*y = (10/a)*(5a/2) = (10*5a)/(a*2) = 50a/(2a) = 25.

Whoa, so xy = 25. That's the product.

So, is that the answer? Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I didn't skip any steps.

So, if x =10/a and y=5a/2, then indeed x*y =25. So regardless of the value of a, the product is 25.

But wait, is that correct? Because a is not arbitrary; it's determined by the original logarithmic equations.

Hmm, but if x and y satisfy those logarithmic conditions, then x*y must be 25.

Wait, but let me verify with the original equations.

Suppose xy=25. Let me see if that holds.

Let me assume that xy=25. Then, y=25/x.

Substitute into the first equation: log_x(y^x) =10.

Which is x * log_x(y) =10, as before.

But log_x(y) = log_x(25/x) = log_x(25) - log_x(x) = log_x(25) -1.

So x*(log_x(25) -1)=10.

Similarly, from the second equation: log_y(x^(4y))=10.

Which is 4y * log_y(x) =10.

Again, log_y(x) = log_y(25/y) = log_y(25) - log_y(y) = log_y(25) -1.

So 4y*(log_y(25) -1)=10.

Hmm, this is getting more involved. Let me see if I can proceed.

Let me denote log_x(25) as some variable, say, b.

Thus, log_x(25) = b, which implies that x^b =25.

Similarly, log_y(25) would be log_y(25) = log_y(x^b) because x^b=25. So, log_y(x^b) = b * log_y(x) = b*(1/log_x(y)).

But earlier, from the first equation, x * log_x(y) =10, so log_x(y)=10/x.

So, log_y(25) = b * (1/(10/x)) )= b * (x/10).

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe instead, use the fact that log_x(25) = b, so log_y(25) = log_y(x^b) = b * log_y(x).

But log_y(x) is 1/(log_x(y)).

From the first equation, log_x(y) =10/x.

So, log_y(x) = x/10.

Thus, log_y(25) = b * (x/10).

But from earlier, b = log_x(25) = log_x(x^b) = b, which is consistent.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, let me think numerically. If xy=25, perhaps x=5 and y=5? Let's test that.

But x and y must be greater than 1, so 5 is fine.

Let me check the first equation with x=5 and y=5.

log_5(5^5) = log_5(3125)=5. But that's equal to 5, not 10. So that doesn't satisfy the first equation. So, x=5, y=5 is not a solution.

Hmm, so my earlier conclusion that xy=25 might be correct, but perhaps x and y aren't 5 and 5.

Wait, maybe x and y are other numbers that multiply to 25.

Let me try x=2 and y=12.5. Then, x*y=25.

First equation: log_2(12.5^2)=log_2(156.25)=log_2(2^7 * 5^2 / 2^2)=log_2(2^5 *5^2)=5 + 2 log_2(5). Which is not 10.

So, that doesn't work either. Hmm.

Wait, so if xy=25, but the values x and y aren't 5 and 5, but something else. So, maybe 25 is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 25, but I need to make sure.

Wait, going back.

We had x =10/a and y =5a/2. So, x*y=25, regardless of a. So, the product must be 25.

But to confirm, let's try to find a.

We had from earlier:

From the first equation, a = log_x(y) = log_x(25/x) = log_x(25) - log_x(x) = log_x(25) -1.

But log_x(25) is the logarithm of 25 with base x, which is ln(25)/ln(x). But x=10/a, so ln(x)=ln(10/a).

So, log_x(25)= ln(25)/(ln(10/a)) = ln(25)/(ln(10) - ln(a)).

So, a = [ln(25)/(ln(10) - ln(a))] -1.

Hmm, that's a complicated equation in terms of a. Maybe I can rearrange it.

Multiply both sides by (ln(10) - ln(a)):

a (ln(10) - ln(a)) = ln(25) - (ln(10) - ln(a)).

Wait, let me write that again.

a (ln(10) - ln(a)) = ln(25) - (ln(10) - ln(a)).

Expand the right side:

= ln(25) - ln(10) + ln(a)

So, the equation is:

a ln(10) - a ln(a) = ln(25) - ln(10) + ln(a)

Bring all terms to the left side:

a ln(10) - a ln(a) - ln(25) + ln(10) - ln(a) = 0

Factor where possible:

= ln(10)(a +1) - ln(a)(a +1) - ln(25)

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, factor (a +1):

= (a +1)(ln(10) - ln(a)) - ln(25) = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can write ln(25) as 2 ln(5):

= (a +1)(ln(10) - ln(a)) - 2 ln(5) = 0

But I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe I can make a substitution. Let me set t = a, so the equation is:

(t +1)(ln(10) - ln(t)) - 2 ln(5) = 0

Hmm, but this seems difficult to solve algebraically. Perhaps I can find a value of t that satisfies this equation.

Let me try t=2.

Then, (2 +1)(ln(10) - ln(2)) - 2 ln(5) = 3*(ln(10/2)) - 2 ln(5) = 3 ln(5) - 2 ln(5) = ln(5) ≈ 1.609, which is not zero.

Next, try t=3.

(4)(ln(10) - ln(3)) - 2 ln(5) ≈ 4*(2.3026 -1.0986) - 2*1.6094 ≈ 4*(1.204) - 3.2188 ≈ 4.816 - 3.2188 ≈ 1.597, still positive.

t=4:

(5)(ln(10) - ln(4)) - 2 ln(5) ≈5*(2.3026 -1.3863) - 3.2189 ≈5*(0.9163) -3.2189≈4.5815 -3.2189≈1.3626

Still positive.

t=5:

(6)(ln(10) - ln(5)) -2 ln(5)=6*(2.3026 -1.6094) -3.2189≈6*(0.6932) -3.2189≈4.1592 -3.2189≈0.9403

Still positive.

t=6:

(7)(ln(10) - ln(6)) -2 ln(5)=7*(2.3026 -1.7918) -3.2189≈7*(0.5108) -3.2189≈3.5756 -3.2189≈0.3567

Still positive.

t=7:

(8)(ln(10) - ln(7)) -2 ln(5)=8*(2.3026 -1.9459) -3.2189≈8*(0.3567) -3.2189≈2.8536 -3.2189≈-0.3653

Now it's negative. So between t=6 and t=7, the function crosses zero.

So, the solution for t (which is a) is between 6 and 7.

So, a is approximately 6.5 or so.

But perhaps exact value is not necessary because we were only asked for xy, which is 25.

Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I made a wrong substitution earlier.

Wait, earlier steps: We have x=10/a and y=5a/2. So, regardless of a, xy=25.

So, regardless of the value of a, the product is 25, so the answer is 25.

Therefore, the product xy is 25.

We are given two logarithmic equations involving real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), both greater than 1:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.
\]

Using the power rule of logarithms, we rewrite these equations as:

1. \( x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10 \)
2. \( 4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10 \)

Let \( a = \log_x(y) \). Then, \( \log_y(x) = \frac{1}{a} \). Substituting into the equations, we get:

1. \( x \cdot a = 10 \) \(\Rightarrow x = \frac{10}{a}\)
2. \( 4y \cdot \frac{1}{a} = 10 \) \(\Rightarrow y = \frac{5a}{2}\)

Now, we find the product \( xy \):

\[
xy = \left(\frac{10}{a}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{5a}{2}\right) = \frac{10 \cdot 5a}{2a} = 25.
\]

Thus, the product \( xy \) is \( \boxed{25} \).
