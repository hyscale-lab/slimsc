Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, an equilateral hexagon means all sides are equal in length. Also, since opposite sides are parallel, it must be a special kind of hexagon, maybe similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily with all internal angles equal. In a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel, but in this case, the hexagon is just equilateral, not necessarily regular.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, 300. Wait, so if I extend these sides, they meet to form a triangle. That suggests that each of these sides is a side of this larger triangle. So, AB, CD, and EF, when extended, form a triangle with these lengths.

I think this means that each of these sides is a side of the triangle, but since the hexagon is convex, the extensions must meet at certain points outside the hexagon. So, the triangle is the outer triangle enclosing the hexagon.

Hmm, maybe I should draw a rough sketch. Let's say the hexagon is labeled ABCDEF in order, so each consecutive pair is connected. Since opposite sides are parallel, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Wait, no: in a hexagon, opposite sides would be AB & DE, BC & EF, CD & FA. Or maybe I got that wrong. Let me think: in a hexagon, each side has exactly one opposite side. So, for a convex hexagon, sides AB and ED are opposite, BC and FE are opposite, CD and AF are opposite? Wait, maybe I should get the order right.

Wait, no, perhaps for a hexagon with vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, F in order, the opposite sides would be AB & DE, BC & EF, and CD & FA. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because DE would be the side from D to E, and AB is from A to B. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the sides being opposite each other in the sequence.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the sides as AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA. So, for a convex hexagon, opposite sides would be AB and DE, BC and EF, CD and FA. So, each pair of opposite sides is parallel: AB || DE, BC || EF, CD || FA. Since it's equilateral, each of these sides has the same length, say 's'.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Wait, so AB is one side of the hexagon, CD is another, and EF is another. When we extend these, they form a triangle with sides 200, 240, 300.

Wait, but which sides of the triangle correspond to which extensions? Let me think. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, each pair of these extended lines should meet at a point forming the triangle. So each side of this triangle is formed by the extension of one of these sides.

But wait, AB is a side of the hexagon, and so is CD and EF. Let me see: when I extend AB, CD, and EF, each of these extensions will meet at points outside the hexagon, forming a larger triangle. Since the hexagon is convex, all these extensions will be outward.

Wait, but how exactly do the extensions of AB, CD, and EF form a triangle? Let me try to imagine: if I extend AB beyond A and B, CD beyond C and D, and EF beyond E and F, then these extensions will intersect each other at certain points outside the hexagon, forming a triangle. Each side of this triangle lies along one of these extended lines.

Wait, maybe it's easier if I label the points where the extensions meet. Let's say that the extension of AB meets the extension of CD at point P, the extension of CD meets the extension of EF at point Q, and the extension of EF meets the extension of AB at point R, forming triangle PQR with sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300.

So, the triangle formed by these three extensions has sides of 200, 240, and 300. Now, the side lengths of this triangle are 200, 240, 300. Hmm, those numbers look familiar. Let me check if they form a Pythagorean triplet: 200^2 + 240^2 = 40000 + 57600 = 97600. 300^2 is 90000, which is less than 97600, so it's an acute triangle. Maybe not a right triangle, but perhaps I can find the ratios for similar triangles.

Wait, but perhaps the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by cutting off smaller triangles from the corners of this larger triangle PQR. Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel, maybe each side of the hexagon is parallel and proportional to the sides of the larger triangle.

Wait, another thought: since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, it's similar to a centrally symmetric hexagon. So, the hexagon might fit inside the triangle in such a way that each side of the hexagon is parallel and scaled down from the corresponding side of the triangle.

Wait, but each pair of opposite sides in the hexagon are parallel. So, for example, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, CD is parallel to FA.

Wait, perhaps the hexagon is similar to the triangle PQR, but scaled down. But since the hexagon has six sides, maybe each side of the hexagon is part of lines that are parallel to the sides of PQR, but offset inward.

Alternatively, maybe the hexagon is such that each side is part of a line that's a portion of the triangle's sides, but shifted inward by some distance. Hmm, perhaps using similar triangles.

Let me think about the hexagon as being formed by three pairs of parallel sides, each pair corresponding to a side of the triangle PQR, but scaled down.

Wait, perhaps each side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of triangle PQR, and the hexagon is in some way a scaled version within the triangle.

Wait, but the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300. Let me compute the ratios between the sides. 200:240:300 can be simplified by dividing each by 20, giving 10:12:15. Hmm, 10:12:15, which is 5:6:7.5, but not sure if that helps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the hexagon is such that each side is a line that's parallel to a side of the triangle, and the hexagon is the inner parallel hexagon, with each side length 's', and the triangle's sides are each longer by some multiple.

Wait, maybe using the concept of similar triangles. If the hexagon's sides are parallel to the triangle's sides, then each side of the triangle is equal to the corresponding side of the hexagon plus some amount depending on the scaling factor.

Alternatively, perhaps using the intercept theorem (also known as Thales' theorem) for parallel lines cutting the sides proportionally.

Wait, let me think: in the triangle PQR, each side is divided by the hexagon into two parts. For example, side PR is divided by point A into segments PA and AR. Similarly, side QR is divided by point C into QC and CR, and side PQ is divided by point E into PE and EQ.

Wait, but perhaps each side of the triangle is divided into segments proportional to the hexagon's side lengths.

Wait, maybe each side of the triangle is equal to twice the length of the hexagon's side. But that might not necessarily be the case.

Wait, let's think in terms of the areas. But maybe that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps using vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me try to assign coordinates to the triangle and then model the hexagon inside.

Let me place triangle PQR such that point P is at (0,0), point Q is at (200, 0), and point R is somewhere in the plane such that the lengths are correct. Wait, but the sides are 200, 240, 300. Wait, so which sides correspond to which lengths? Let me check:

Suppose PR is 200, QR is 240, and PQ is 300. Wait, but 300 is the longest side, so that would make triangle PQR with sides 200, 240, 300. Let me confirm using the triangle inequality: 200 + 240 > 300? 440 > 300, yes. 200 + 300 > 240? 500 > 240, yes. 240 + 300 > 200? 540 > 200, yes. So that's a valid triangle.

Wait, but perhaps I should set up the triangle with PR = 200, PQ = 300, QR = 240. Hmm, but then I can place the points:

Let me place point P at (0,0).

Point Q at (300, 0).

Point R somewhere in the plane.

Then, the distance from P to R is 200, and from Q to R is 240.

So, the coordinates of R can be found using the distance formula.

Let me denote R as (x, y).

Then, from P(0,0) to R(x, y): sqrt(x² + y²) = 200.

From Q(300,0) to R(x,y): sqrt((x-300)^2 + y^2) = 240.

So, we can set up the equations:

x² + y² = 200² = 40000.

(x-300)^2 + y^2 = 240² = 57600.

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

(x-300)^2 + y^2 - (x² + y^2) = 57600 - 40000.

Expanding (x-300)^2: x² - 600x + 90000.

So, x² - 600x + 90000 + y^2 - x² - y^2 = 17600.

Simplify: -600x + 90000 = 17600.

So, -600x = 17600 - 90000 = -72400.

Divide both sides by -600: x = (-72400)/(-600) = 72400/600.

Simplify: 72400 ÷ 200 = 362, 600 ÷ 200 = 3. So 362/3 ≈ 120.666... Hmm, but let me compute that exactly.

Wait, 72400 ÷ 600: 72400 = 724 * 100, 600 = 6 * 100, so 724/6 = 120.666..., which is 120 and 2/3.

So, x = 120.666... Now, plug x back into the first equation to find y.

x² + y² = 40000.

So, y² = 40000 - x².

x is 72400/600 = 724/6 = 362/3 ≈ 120.6667.

So, x² = (362/3)^2 = (362)^2 /9.

Compute 362^2: 360^2 = 129600, plus 2*360*2 + 2^2 = 129600 + 1440 + 4 = 131044.

So, x² = 131044 / 9.

Then, y² = 40000 - (131044 / 9) = (360000/9) - (131044/9) = (360000 - 131044) / 9 = 228956 / 9.

So, y = sqrt(228956 / 9) = sqrt(228956)/3.

Compute sqrt(228956): Let's see, 478^2 = 478*478.

Compute 478*478: 400*400=160000, 400*78=31200, 78*400=31200, 78*78=6084. So, (400+78)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*78 +78^2 = 160000 + 62400 + 6084 = 160000+62400=222400; 222400+6084=228484. Hmm, but 478^2=228484, which is less than 228956. The difference is 228956 - 228484 = 472.

So, 478^2 = 228484, 479^2 = (478+1)^2 = 478^2 + 2*478 +1 = 228484 + 956 +1 = 229441. But 229441 is greater than 228956. So, the square root is between 478 and 479.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check 478^2 again.

Wait, 478 * 478: 400*400=160000, 400*78=31200, 78*400=31200, 78*78=6084. So sum is 160000 + 31200 + 31200 + 6084. Wait, that's 160000 + 62400 + 6084 = 160000+62400=222400; 222400 + 6084=228484. So, correct.

So, 478^2=228484, and 478.5^2 would be 478^2 + 2*478*0.5 + 0.5^2 = 228484 + 478 + 0.25 = 228962.25. But 228962.25 is larger than 228956, so sqrt(228956) is just a bit less than 478.5.

Wait, perhaps it's 478.49?

But perhaps it's not necessary to compute the exact value. Anyway, point R is at (362/3, sqrt(228956)/3). Hmm, but maybe I should proceed without assigning specific coordinates, as this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps using vectors or affine transformations.

Wait, another approach: Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, each pair of opposite sides is equal and parallel, so the hexagon can be considered as a translation of each pair of sides.

Wait, perhaps the hexagon can be seen as a combination of three parallelograms, each corresponding to a pair of opposite sides. But maybe that's overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the hexagon as a centrally symmetric hexagon. In a centrally symmetric hexagon, each vertex has an opposite vertex, and the sides are in pairs of equal length and parallel.

Wait, but in this problem, it's given that it's convex, equilateral, and opposite sides are parallel, which suggests central symmetry.

Wait, so in a centrally symmetric hexagon, the opposite sides are not only parallel but also equal in length, which is given here since it's equilateral.

So, perhaps the hexagon can be thought of as formed by three pairs of parallel lines, each pair separated by some distance, and the hexagon is the intersection of three such strips.

Wait, but how does this help me relate to the triangle with sides 200, 240, 300?

Hmm, maybe I can model the hexagon as being similar to the triangle, but scaled down by some factor 'k', such that each side of the triangle is divided into two parts: one part corresponds to the side of the hexagon, and the other part is the extension beyond the hexagon.

Wait, but each side of the triangle is formed by extending a side of the hexagon. So, for example, the side of length 200 in the triangle is formed by extending side AB of the hexagon, and similarly for the others.

Wait, perhaps each side of the triangle is equal to the side of the hexagon plus twice some extension. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the triangle and the hexagon might form similar figures, with the hexagon being a scaled version inside the triangle.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the sides of the triangle to the hexagon can be determined by the intercept theorem.

Wait, for example, if I consider one side of the triangle, say of length 200, and the hexagon's corresponding side is s. Then, the line extending the hexagon's side would form a smaller similar triangle inside, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the triangle formed by the extensions is similar to the hexagon's triangle.

Wait, perhaps using similarity ratios. Let me assume that the hexagon's sides are parallel to the triangle's sides, and so the hexagon is similar to the triangle but scaled down by a factor 'k'.

Wait, but the hexagon has six sides, while the triangle has three. Hmm, perhaps each side of the hexagon corresponds to a portion of the triangle's sides.

Wait, perhaps each side of the triangle is divided by the hexagon into two segments of length 'a' and 'b', such that a + b = triangle side length. And the hexagon side length s is related to a and b.

Wait, but how exactly? Maybe using similar triangles.

Wait, let me consider the triangle PQR with sides 200, 240, 300. The hexagon is inside this triangle, with each side parallel to a side of the triangle.

So, for each side of the triangle, the hexagon's corresponding side is parallel and at a certain distance from it. The length of the hexagon's side would then be scaled by a factor depending on the distance from the triangle's side.

Wait, maybe using the concept that the ratio of the sides of the hexagon to the triangle is equal to the ratio of their distances from the opposite vertex.

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the idea that the hexagon can be seen as a triangle with each side 'cut' by a line parallel to the opposite side, reducing each side's length by a certain proportion.

Wait, for example, if I have triangle PQR, and I draw lines parallel to each side at some distance inward, forming a smaller triangle inside. The points where these lines intersect would form a smaller, similar triangle. But in this case, it's a hexagon, not a triangle, so perhaps each side is cut twice, once on each end, forming a hexagon.

Wait, so if I take each side of the triangle and draw a line parallel to it, but at some distance inward, and then do this for all three sides, the intersection points would form a smaller triangle inside. But the hexagon would require that each original side is cut twice, not once.

Ah, so perhaps the hexagon is formed by cutting each side of the triangle PQR twice, once near each end, with lines parallel to the opposite sides. So, for each side of PQR, say PQ, we draw a line parallel to PR from a point near P, and another line parallel to QR from a point near Q. The intersection of these lines with the other sides would form the hexagon.

Wait, that might make sense. So, each side of the hexagon is part of a line parallel to a side of the triangle PQR, and the hexagon is thus a convex polygon within PQR, with each side parallel to a side of PQR.

In that case, the hexagon would have sides that are scaled-down versions of PQR's sides, each scaled by some factor.

Wait, but how to relate the side lengths of the hexagon to those of the triangle.

Alternatively, perhaps each side of the hexagon is part of a line that's a certain distance from the corresponding side of the triangle. Then, using the ratio of distances, we can find the scaling factor.

Wait, but without knowing the exact distances, maybe I can use the fact that the hexagon is equilateral, so all its sides are equal length 's'.

Wait, but in a triangle, each side is being cut twice by lines parallel to the other sides. So, for example, on side PQ (length 300), we draw a line parallel to PR (length 200) and a line parallel to QR (length 240). The points where these lines intersect the other sides would form the vertices of the hexagon.

Let me try to model this.

Let me denote the triangle PQR with sides PQ=300, QR=240, PR=200.

Let me draw lines parallel to PR from points along PQ, say at a distance 'a' from P and 'b' from Q, such that these lines intersect the other sides at points that form the hexagon.

Wait, perhaps more systematically: Let me consider the side PQ of length 300. From point P, I draw a line parallel to PR, which is of length 200. Similarly, from point Q, I draw a line parallel to QR (length 240). The intersection of these lines with other sides will form the hexagon.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to use barycentric coordinates or area ratios.

Wait, another approach: Since the hexagon is equilateral and each side is parallel to a side of the triangle, the hexagon can be considered as a similar triangle scaled by some factor 'k', but with each side divided into segments.

Wait, but the hexagon has six sides, so perhaps each side of the triangle is divided into two parts by the hexagon, each part proportional to the scaling factor.

Wait, perhaps using the intercept theorem: if a line is drawn parallel to a side of a triangle, it divides the other two sides proportionally.

So, for example, if I draw a line parallel to PR from a point on PQ, it will divide QR and QP proportionally.

Wait, let's say that on side PQ of the triangle PQR, I choose a point A such that PA = x, and AQ = 300 - x. Then, drawing a line from A parallel to PR will meet QR at some point B, and drawing a line from A parallel to QR will meet PR at some point C.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think of all three sides being cut proportionally.

Wait, since the hexagon is equilateral, each of these divisions must be such that the resulting segments on each side of the triangle are proportional, leading to the hexagon's sides all being equal.

Let me denote the scaling factor as 'k', such that each side of the hexagon is 'k' times the corresponding side of the triangle. Wait, but the triangle has three sides, while the hexagon has six, so perhaps each side of the triangle corresponds to two sides of the hexagon.

Wait, perhaps each side of the triangle is divided into two parts by the hexagon, each of length proportional to 'k' and (1 - k) times the triangle's side. Then, the corresponding sides of the hexagon would be parallel to the triangle's sides and scaled by 'k'.

Wait, but since the hexagon is equilateral, the scaling factors for each pair of sides must be the same. So, each side of the hexagon would be equal to 'k' times the corresponding triangle's side.

Wait, but the triangle's sides are of different lengths: 200, 240, 300. So, if each side of the hexagon is 'k' times the corresponding triangle's side, then the hexagon's side length 's' would be equal to k*200, k*240, and k*300. But since the hexagon is equilateral, all these must be equal, which is only possible if k=0, which doesn't make sense. So, that approach might not work.

Hmm, perhaps I need a different approach.

Wait, another idea: Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as a translation of each pair of opposite sides. So, each pair of opposite sides is separated by some distance, and the side length of the hexagon relates to the triangle's sides through this distance.

Wait, perhaps using the concept of homothety, which is a dilation (scaling) transformation. If the hexagon is a homothetic image of the triangle, then the sides would be scaled by a certain factor, and the centers would correspond.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry. Let's assign coordinates to the triangle and model the hexagon within it.

Let me place point P at (0,0), point Q at (300, 0), and point R somewhere in the plane such that PR=200 and QR=240. Wait, I think I did this earlier, but let me proceed.

From earlier, I found that R is at (362/3, sqrt(228956)/3) ≈ (120.6667, 478.49/3 ≈ 159.4997). So, approximately (120.6667, 159.5).

But perhaps it's better to work with exact fractions.

So, R is at (362/3, sqrt(228956)/3). Let's denote this as (x, y).

Now, the hexagon is inside this triangle, with each pair of opposite sides parallel to the triangle's sides.

Let me denote the hexagon's vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F.

Since AB, CD, EF are extended to form the triangle, and opposite sides are parallel, AB is parallel to DE, BC parallel to EF, CD parallel to FA.

Wait, perhaps each side of the hexagon lies along a line that's parallel to a side of the triangle, and each such line is a certain distance away from the triangle's side.

Let me consider side AB of the hexagon. AB is parallel to DE, and they are both opposite sides. So, AB is a side that is part of a line parallel to, say, side PR of the triangle.

Wait, but perhaps each side of the hexagon is part of a line that's parallel to one of the triangle's sides. So, AB is parallel to PR, BC is parallel to QR, CD is parallel to PQ, and so on.

Wait, but the triangle has three sides, and the hexagon has six sides, so each triangle side corresponds to two hexagon sides. Hmm, that might make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair of opposite sides of the hexagon corresponds to one side of the triangle.

Wait, perhaps each side of the triangle is associated with two sides of the hexagon, each being a translation of that side.

Wait, perhaps the hexagon can be viewed as a combination of three parallelograms, each corresponding to a side of the triangle. For example, each parallelogram would have one side along the hexagon and the other side along the triangle's side.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should approach this with vectors.

Let me try setting up a coordinate system where point P is at (0,0), Q is at (300, 0), and R is at (x, y), as computed earlier.

Now, the hexagon has sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA, each of length 's', and opposite sides are parallel.

Since AB is parallel to DE, BC parallel to EF, and CD parallel to FA.

Now, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, they form the triangle PQR.

Wait, so the lines containing AB, CD, and EF, when extended, form the triangle PQR.

So, line AB, when extended, forms one side of PQR, line CD when extended forms another, and line EF when extended forms the third.

Wait, but in reality, each side of PQR is formed by the extension of one of these lines.

So, for example, line AB, when extended, forms side PQ of the triangle. Similarly, line CD when extended forms side QR, and line EF when extended forms side PR.

Wait, but in that case, each side of the triangle is formed by the extension of one of the hexagon's sides.

So, line AB extended beyond B forms side PQ beyond Q, line CD extended beyond D forms side QR beyond R, and line EF extended beyond F forms side PR beyond R.

Wait, perhaps the hexagon is such that each of its sides AB, CD, EF is a part of the lines that form the triangle's sides when extended.

Wait, but each of these lines (AB, CD, EF) is extended to form the triangle, so each of these lines is a side of the triangle. But that can't be because the triangle has only three sides, while the hexagon has three sides (AB, CD, EF) being extended to form the triangle.

Wait, perhaps the lines AB, CD, and EF are concurrent and form the triangle when extended, but that's not the case because in a convex hexagon, these lines would not be concurrent.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each of the lines AB, CD, EF is a side of the triangle when extended, but that seems conflicting because a triangle only has three sides.

Wait, perhaps each of the lines AB, CD, EF, when extended, meet at points forming the triangle. So, line AB meets line CD at point P, line CD meets line EF at point Q, and line EF meets line AB at point R, forming triangle PQR with sides PQ=200, QR=240, PR=300. Wait, but earlier I thought the sides were 200, 240, 300, but I'm getting a bit confused about which side corresponds to which.

Wait, let me correct that. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. So, each of these extensions forms a side of the triangle. So, for example, line AB, when extended beyond A and B, meets line CD extended beyond C and D at point P, which is a vertex of the triangle. Similarly, line CD extended beyond C and D meets line EF extended beyond E and F at point Q, and line EF extended beyond E and F meets line AB extended beyond A and B at point R, forming triangle PQR with sides PQ=200, QR=240, PR=300.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the sides correspond directly to these lengths. Maybe PQ is 200, QR is 240, and PR is 300. So, the triangle PQR has sides of these lengths.

Now, the hexagon is inside this triangle, with each of its sides AB, CD, EF lying on lines that, when extended, form the sides of PQR.

So, AB lies on the line PR, CD lies on the line QR, and EF lies on the line PQ.

Wait, but that might not fit with the hexagon being convex and having opposite sides parallel.

Wait, perhaps each side of the hexagon is part of a line that's parallel to a side of the triangle, but offset inward.

Wait, let me think: if AB is a side of the hexagon, which is parallel to DE, which is opposite to AB, then line AB and DE are both parallel to some side of the triangle.

Wait, perhaps AB is parallel to side PQ of the triangle, CD is parallel to QR, and EF is parallel to PR.

Wait, if that's the case, then the lines AB, CD, EF are each parallel to a side of the triangle, and their extensions form the triangle's sides.

Wait, that seems plausible. So, line AB is parallel to PQ, line CD is parallel to QR, and line EF is parallel to PR. Then, when extended, these lines would meet at the vertices of the triangle PQR.

Wait, but if AB is parallel to PQ, then line AB is a translated version of PQ, but shorter, lying inside the triangle. Similarly for CD and EF.

If that's the case, then the hexagon can be considered as a smaller, similar figure inside the triangle, but with each side parallel to the triangle's sides.

Wait, but since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are equal length 's', and the triangle's sides are 200, 240, 300. So, perhaps each side of the hexagon is a scaled version of the triangle's sides.

Wait, but how to relate 's' to the triangle's sides.

Wait, perhaps using the concept of similar triangles. If the hexagon is similar to the triangle, but scaled down by a factor 'k', then each side of the hexagon would be 'k' times the corresponding side of the triangle. But since the hexagon has three pairs of sides, each corresponding to a side of the triangle, perhaps each side of the hexagon is 'k' times the triangle's side.

Wait, but the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300, and the hexagon's sides are all 's'. So, if each side of the hexagon is a scaled version, then s = k * 200, s = k * 240, and s = k * 300. But that would only be possible if 200 = 240 = 300, which is not the case. So, that approach must be wrong.

Hmm, perhaps the hexagon isn't similar to the triangle, but instead, the lines forming the hexagon's sides are parallel to the triangle's sides and create a system where each side of the hexagon is a portion of a line parallel to a triangle's side.

Wait, perhaps using the intercept theorem. Let me denote the scaling factors for each side as follows: For the side of length 200 in the triangle, the hexagon's corresponding side is s, and the portion beyond the hexagon is a certain length. Similarly for the other sides.

Wait, but since the hexagon is equilateral, the scaling factors for each side must relate in such a way that the resulting side lengths of the hexagon are equal.

Wait, perhaps the idea is that the hexagon's sides form similar triangles within the larger triangle, each scaled by a factor, and the product of the scaling factors relates to the hexagon's side length.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this using similar triangles on each side.

Let me denote the scaling factor for the side of length 200 as 'a', so the portion beyond the hexagon is a * 200, and the hexagon's side is (1 - a) * 200. Similarly, for the side of length 240, scaling factor 'b', and for 300, scaling factor 'c'. But since the hexagon is equilateral, all these scaled portions must be equal.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. The hexagon's side would be the scaled portion. So, if I scale the triangle's side by a factor 'k', then the hexagon's side would be k * 200 = k * 240 = k * 300, which again is impossible unless k=0, which can't be.

Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, another thought: The hexagon can be seen as the intersection of three strips, each parallel to a side of the triangle and at some distance from it. The width of each strip would be such that the intersection forms the hexagon.

Wait, perhaps the distance from each side of the triangle to the corresponding parallel side of the hexagon is the same proportion of the triangle's height.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps I can use the areas. The area of the triangle can be found using Heron's formula, and the area of the hexagon can be related to it somehow. But without knowing more about the hexagon's structure, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, let me compute the area of triangle PQR with sides 200, 240, 300 using Heron's formula.

First, compute the semi-perimeter, s = (200 + 240 + 300)/2 = (740)/2 = 370.

Then, the area is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[370*(370-200)*(370-240)*(370-300)].

Compute each term:

370 - 200 = 170

370 - 240 = 130

370 - 300 = 70

So, area = sqrt[370 * 170 * 130 * 70].

Compute this:

370 * 170 = 62,900

130 * 70 = 9,100

So, 62,900 * 9,100 = ?

Wait, that's a big number. Maybe factor it.

Alternatively, compute sqrt(370 * 170 * 130 * 70).

Let me factor each number:

370 = 37 * 10

170 = 17 * 10

130 = 13 * 10

70 = 7 * 10

So, 370 * 170 * 130 * 70 = (37 * 10) * (17 * 10) * (13 * 10) * (7 * 10) = 37 * 17 * 13 * 7 * 10^4.

Compute 37*17: 37*10=370, 37*7=259; total 370+259=629.

13*7=91.

So, 629 * 91 = ?

Compute 629 * 90 = 56,610; 629 * 1 = 629; total 56,610 + 629 = 57,239.

So, the product is 57,239 * 10^4.

So, sqrt(57,239 * 10^4) = sqrt(57,239) * 10^2.

Compute sqrt(57,239). Let me see, 239^2 = 57,121, because 240^2=57,600. So, 239^2=57,121, which is less than 57,239. 240^2=57,600, which is higher. So, sqrt(57,239) is between 239 and 240.

Compute 239.5^2: (239 + 0.5)^2 = 239^2 + 2*239*0.5 + 0.5^2 = 57,121 + 239 + 0.25 = 57,360.25. Hmm, which is larger than 57,239. So, sqrt(57,239) is approximately 239.2.

Thus, the area is approximately 239.2 * 10^2 = 23,920.

Wait, but that's an approximate value. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor it better.

Wait, 57,239 is 57,239. Let me check if it's a perfect square. 239^2 is 57,121, as before. 239*239=57,121. 239*240=57,360. So, 57,239 is not a perfect square, so the area is sqrt(57,239) * 100 ≈ 239.2 * 100 ≈ 23,920.

But perhaps I don't need the exact area. Maybe the area ratio can help relate the hexagon's side length to the triangle's side lengths.

Wait, but perhaps another approach: using parallel lines and similar triangles.

If I consider the hexagon as being formed by lines parallel to the triangle's sides, each at a certain distance inward, then each side of the hexagon is a portion of such a line.

Wait, perhaps if I denote the distance from each side of the triangle to the corresponding parallel side of the hexagon as 'd', then the scaling factor for each side would be related to 'd' and the triangle's height.

Wait, but without knowing the heights, maybe I can relate the scaling factors through the side lengths.

Wait, another thought: The hexagon's sides are each a certain proportion of the triangle's sides. Let me denote this proportion as 'k', so each side of the hexagon is 'k' times the corresponding triangle's side.

Wait, but the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300. So, the hexagon's sides would be 200k, 240k, 300k. But since the hexagon is equilateral, all these must be equal, so 200k = 240k = 300k. Which is only possible if k=0, which doesn't make sense. So, this approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the hexagon's sides are not proportional to the triangle's sides, but instead, each side of the hexagon is formed by the intersection of two lines parallel to two sides of the triangle.

Wait, perhaps each vertex of the hexagon lies at the intersection of two lines, each parallel to a different side of the triangle.

For example, vertex A is the intersection of a line parallel to QR and a line parallel to PR. Similarly, vertex B is the intersection of a line parallel to PR and a line parallel to PQ, and so on.

Wait, in that case, each side of the hexagon would be the distance between two such intersections, and since all sides are equal, the distances between these intersections must be equal.

Wait, perhaps using ratios. Let me denote the scaling factors for the lines parallel to PR, QR, and PQ as 'a', 'b', and 'c' respectively. So, the lines parallel to PR are at a distance 'a' from PR, those parallel to QR are at a distance 'b' from QR, and those parallel to PQ are at a distance 'c' from PQ.

But this might complicate things further. Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of similar triangles and setting up ratios based on the hexagon's side length.

Wait, another approach: Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel, the hexagon can be considered as a affine transformation of a regular hexagon. But perhaps that's too abstract.

Wait, perhaps using vectors. Let me define vectors for the sides of the triangle and then express the hexagon's sides in terms of these vectors.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the problem statement, perhaps the key lies in the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me denote this triangle as T with sides 200, 240, 300.

In this triangle, each side is formed by the extension of one of the hexagon's sides. So, for example, side of length 200 in T is formed by extending AB, side of length 240 is formed by extending CD, and side of length 300 is formed by extending EF.

Wait, since AB, CD, and EF are sides of the hexagon, and the hexagon is convex, these extensions must meet at points beyond the hexagon's vertices.

Now, perhaps the hexagon can be thought of as a section of the triangle T, where each side of the hexagon is a portion of a line that's parallel to a side of T.

Wait, but if AB is part of a line that, when extended, forms a side of T, then AB is a segment of that line. Similarly for CD and EF.

Wait, perhaps each side of the triangle T is divided into two parts by the hexagon: the part that's part of the hexagon's side and the extension beyond.

Wait, but since the hexagon is convex and inside T, each side of T is divided into two parts: the part that's part of the hexagon and the extension beyond it.

Wait, perhaps using similar triangles for each division.

Let me denote the side of T opposite to vertex P as QR with length 200, opposite to Q as PR with length 240, and opposite to R as PQ with length 300. Wait, but earlier I considered PQ as 300, QR as 240, and PR as 200.

Wait, regardless, each side of T is divided by the hexagon's sides into two parts. Let me consider the side QR of length 240. It's divided by the hexagon's side CD into two segments: one of length 'm' and the other of length 'n', such that m + n = 240.

Similarly, side PR of length 200 is divided by AB into two parts, say 'p' and 'q', where p + q = 200.

And side PQ of length 300 is divided by EF into two parts, say 'r' and 's', where r + s = 300.

Now, since the hexagon is equilateral, each of its sides AB, CD, EF must have the same length 's', which is the side length we're trying to find.

Wait, but how does this division relate to the side length 's' of the hexagon?

Perhaps using similar triangles: when a line is drawn parallel to a side of a triangle, it divides the other two sides proportionally.

So, for example, if a line is drawn parallel to QR (length 240) from a point on PR, it will divide PR and PQ proportionally.

Wait, but in this case, CD is a side of the hexagon, which is part of a line parallel to QR. So, CD is parallel to QR, and lies inside the triangle T, dividing PR and PQ into segments.

Similarly, AB is parallel to PQ, and EF is parallel to PR.

Wait, perhaps using the intercept theorem (Thales' theorem) for each of these lines.

Let me consider line CD, which is parallel to QR. It meets PR at some point, say D, and PQ at some point, say C.

Wait, but actually, in the hexagon, CD is one side, so the line CD is parallel to QR.

Similarly, AB is parallel to PQ, and EF is parallel to PR.

Wait, so each of these lines (AB, CD, EF) is parallel to a side of the triangle T.

Thus, each of these lines divides the other two sides of T proportionally.

Let me denote the ratios as follows:

For line AB, which is parallel to PQ: Let the ratio of PA to PR be 'k', so PA = k * PR = k * 200. Similarly, the ratio along PQ would be the same, so the segment from P to the intersection point on PQ would be k * PQ = k * 300.

Similarly, for line CD, which is parallel to QR: Let the ratio of PC to PR be 'm', so PC = m * PR = m * 200. The corresponding point on PQ would then be m * 300 from P.

Wait, but this might not be the right way to model it. Alternatively, perhaps each of these lines (AB, CD, EF) divides the sides of T proportionally, with the same ratio.

Wait, but since the hexagon is equilateral, the proportions must be such that each side of the hexagon has the same length.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the lines AB, CD, EF are each drawn such that they cut off a similar triangle from T, and the remaining figure is the hexagon. But since the hexagon has six sides, perhaps each side is part of a line that cuts off a smaller triangle from each corner.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The hexagon can be seen as the inner parallel hexagon to triangle T, with each side parallel and offset inward by some distance. The side length of the hexagon would then be related to the side lengths of T through the offset distance and the angles of T.

Wait, but without knowing the angles, perhaps I can relate the side lengths using the ratios of the similar triangles formed.

Wait, perhaps the hexagon's side length 's' can be found by the formula s = (a * b * c) / (a + b + c), but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps using the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals, but that's just a guess.

Wait, let me think about the triangle T with sides 200, 240, 300. Let me compute the area using Heron's formula, as I tried earlier.

But perhaps it's better to compute it accurately.

Using Heron's formula:

s = (200 + 240 + 300)/2 = 740/2 = 370.

Area = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[370*(370 - 200)*(370 - 240)*(370 - 300)] = sqrt[370*170*130*70].

Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 370 * 170 = 62,900.

130 * 70 = 9,100.

Now, 62,900 * 9,100 = ?

Let me compute 62,900 * 9,100:

= 62,900 * (9,000 + 100) = 62,900*9,000 + 62,900*100.

= 566,100,000 + 6,290,000 = 572,390,000.

So, the product inside the square root is 572,390,000.

Now, sqrt(572,390,000) = sqrt(572,390 * 1000) = sqrt(572,390) * sqrt(1000) ≈ 23,920 * 31.623 ≈ but that's not accurate.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: 572,390,000 = 5.7239 × 10^8.

sqrt(5.7239 × 10^8) = sqrt(5.7239) × 10^4 ≈ 2.392 × 10^4 = 23,920.

So, area ≈ 23,920.

Wait, but let me check this with another method. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula (1/2)*base*height.

But without knowing the height, perhaps it's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps using the area to find the inradius or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: The hexagon is equilateral, so all its sides are equal. Since it's inside triangle T, perhaps the side length 's' can be found using the formula s = (a + b + c)/3, where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle. So, (200 + 240 + 300)/3 = 740/3 ≈ 246.666... But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps using the harmonic mean: 3/(1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300). But that would be 3/( (6/1200) + (5/1200) + (4/1200) ) = 3/(15/1200) )= 3/(1/80) )= 240. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's applicable.

Wait, perhaps the side length 's' of the hexagon is the harmonic mean of the triangle's sides. But I'm not sure.

Wait, if I suppose that s = 200 * 240 * 300 / (200 + 240 + 300) = (200*240*300)/740.

Compute numerator: 200*240 = 48,000; 48,000*300 = 14,400,000.

Divide by 740: 14,400,000 / 740 ≈ let's compute:

740 × 19,000 = 14,060,000.

14,400,000 - 14,060,000 = 340,000.

740 × 460 = 340,400, which is slightly more than 340,000.

So, 19,000 + 460 = 19,460, but since 740 × 460 = 340,400, which is 400 more than 340,000.

So, 14,400,000 /740 ≈ 19,460 - (400/740) ≈ 19,460 - 0.54 ≈ 19,459.46.

But that seems too large, as the triangle's sides are 200-300, so the hexagon's side being 19,000+ doesn't make sense. So, this approach is wrong.

Hmm, maybe I should consider the reciprocal.

Wait, perhaps the side length 's' is given by (200 * 240 * 300) / (200 + 240 + 300) = 14,400,000 / 740 ≈ 19,459.46. No, that can't be right because it's much larger than the triangle's sides.

Wait, another approach: Since the hexagon is formed by three pairs of parallel sides, each pair corresponding to a side of the triangle, the hexagon can be considered as the intersection of three strips, each parallel to a triangle side and at a distance 'd' from it. The side length 's' of the hexagon would then be related to 'd' and the triangle's side lengths.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the side length of a hexagon formed inside a triangle by lines parallel to its sides. I recall that in some cases, the side length can be found using the formula s = (a + b + c)/3, but I'm not certain.

Wait, in a regular hexagon inscribed in an equilateral triangle, the side length would be a third of the triangle's side, but this is a different case.

Wait, perhaps in this problem, the side length of the hexagon is the harmonic mean of the triangle's sides. The harmonic mean of 200, 240, 300 is 3/(1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300) = 3/( (6 + 5 + 4)/1200 ) = 3/(15/1200) )= 3*(1200/15) )= 3*80=240.

Hmm, so the harmonic mean is 240. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the side length is 120, which is half of 240.

Wait, but I need a more systematic approach.

Let me consider that the hexagon is formed by three pairs of parallel lines, each pair parallel to a side of the triangle, and each pair cutting off a small triangle from the corners of the larger triangle T.

Each of these small triangles is similar to T, with a scaling factor 'k', such that the side length of the hexagon is 'k' times the corresponding side of T.

Wait, but since the hexagon is equilateral, the scaling factors for each pair must be the same.

Wait, let me define 'k' as the scaling factor for each of these small triangles. So, each small triangle has sides k*200, k*240, k*300.

The side length of the hexagon would then be the side of the triangle minus twice the small triangle's side, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the side of the hexagon is the length of the side of T minus the two small triangles cut off from each end.

Wait, but the hexagon isn't just cutting off small triangles from the corners; it's more complex because the hexagon has six sides.

Wait, perhaps the hexagon can be seen as the intersection of three trapezoids, each formed by a side of T and a line parallel to it inside T. Each trapezoid would have one base as a side of T and the other base as a side of the hexagon.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are equal, so the lengths of these other bases (the hexagon's sides) must be equal.

So, for each side of T, the corresponding side of the hexagon is a line parallel to it at some distance inside T, and the length of this line is 's'.

The problem then reduces to finding 's' such that all three sides of the hexagon are equal.

Now, using the properties of similar triangles, the length of a line parallel to a side of a triangle and at a certain distance from it can be found using the ratio of the heights.

Let me denote the height of triangle T corresponding to side a as h_a, and similarly h_b and h_c for the other sides.

Then, if a line is drawn parallel to side a at a height of (h_a - d), the length of this line would be a * (h_a - d)/h_a.

Similarly for the other sides.

But since the hexagon is equilateral, the lengths of these lines must all equal 's'.

So, for each side of T:

s = a * (h_a - d_a)/h_a

s = b * (h_b - d_b)/h_b

s = c * (h_c - d_c)/h_c

But since the lines are drawn such that the hexagon is formed, the distances d_a, d_b, d_c must be related in a way that the hexagon closes properly.

Wait, perhaps the sum of the ratios is the same for each side.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the ratios are the same for each side, leading to d_a/h_a = d_b/h_b = d_c/h_c = k, for some k.

If that's the case, then:

s = a*(1 - k)

s = b*(1 - k)

s = c*(1 - k)

Which would imply a = b = c, which isn't the case here, so this approach must be wrong.

Hmm, perhaps the distances d_a, d_b, d_c are different, but the resulting side lengths are the same.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: The hexagon's sides are each parallel to the triangle's sides, and the hexagon is equilateral. So, the ratios of the hexagon's sides to the triangle's sides must be such that each side of the hexagon is the same length.

Let me denote the ratios as r1, r2, r3 for the sides of T: 200, 240, 300. So, s = 200*r1 = 240*r2 = 300*r3.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, all these must be equal to 's'.

Now, the key is to find r1, r2, r3 such that the lines drawn at these ratios form a closed hexagon.

Wait, perhaps using the concept of similar triangles and the intercept theorem, the ratios must satisfy certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratios are related to the areas or something else.

Wait, if I consider the triangle T and the smaller triangles cut off by the hexagon's sides, each of these smaller triangles would be similar to T, with scaling factors r1, r2, r3.

Wait, but since the hexagon is formed by three such cuts, the sum of the areas of these smaller triangles would be subtracted from the area of T to give the area of the hexagon.

But without knowing the area of the hexagon, this might not help.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that the lines drawn are parallel, the distances from the sides are proportional, and the hexagon's side lengths are equal.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should look for a formula or a known result.

Wait, I recall that in such problems, where a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel is inscribed in a triangle, the side length of the hexagon can be found using the formula:

s = (a * b * c) / (a + b + c)

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me test it with the given values.

s = (200 * 240 * 300) / (200 + 240 + 300) = (14,400,000) / 740 ≈ 19,459.46. That can't be right, as it's larger than the triangle's sides.

Hmm, that approach must be wrong.

Wait, another idea: In a triangle, if three lines are drawn parallel to the sides, forming a smaller triangle inside, the side length of this inner triangle can be found using the formula s = (a + b + c)/3. But again, I'm not sure.

In this case, the inner figure is a hexagon, not a triangle, so that formula wouldn't apply.

Wait, perhaps each side of the hexagon is the harmonic mean of two sides of the triangle.

Wait, the harmonic mean of 200 and 240 is 2*(200*240)/(200+240) = 48,000/440 ≈ 109.09.

But that's just a guess, and I'm not sure how it would relate to the third side.

Alternatively, perhaps the side length is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the triangle's sides.

But 1/(1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300) ≈ 1/(0.005 + 0.0041667 + 0.0033333) ≈ 1/(0.0125) ≈ 80. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be solved using the concept of similar triangles and setting up equations based on the ratios.

Let me consider that the hexagon's sides AB, CD, EF are each parallel to the triangle's sides PQ, QR, PR respectively.

Let me denote the ratio of similarity for AB (parallel to PQ) as r. So, AB = r * PQ = r * 300.

Similarly, CD is parallel to QR, so CD = r * QR = r * 240.

EF is parallel to PR, so EF = r * PR = r * 200.

But since the hexagon is equilateral, all these must be equal to 's', so:

r * 300 = r * 240 = r * 200 = s.

But this would only be possible if r=0, which isn't feasible. So, this approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps each side of the hexagon is scaled differently, but the hexagon's side lengths are all equal. So, perhaps:

s = a * r1 = b * r2 = c * r3,

where a, b, c are the triangle's sides (200, 240, 300), and r1, r2, r3 are the scaling factors for each side.

But how to relate r1, r2, r3.

Wait, perhaps the sum of the scaling factors for each side equals 1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The hexagon can be considered as the intersection of three trapezoids, each formed by a side of the triangle and a line parallel to it inside the triangle. Each trapezoid has one base as a side of the triangle and the other base as a side of the hexagon.

Since all sides of the hexagon are equal, the lengths of these other bases must be equal. Thus, for each side of the triangle, the length of the corresponding parallel side of the hexagon is 's', and this can be expressed in terms of the triangle's side and the distance from the side.

Let me denote the distances from the triangle's sides to the hexagon's sides as d1, d2, d3, corresponding to sides of lengths 200, 240, 300 respectively.

Then, using similar triangles, the length 's' can be expressed as:

s = 200 * (1 - d1/h1) = 240 * (1 - d2/h2) = 300 * (1 - d3/h3),

where h1, h2, h3 are the heights of the triangle corresponding to sides 200, 240, 300.

But without knowing the heights, this might not be helpful.

Wait, perhaps the sum of the ratios (d1/h1 + d2/h2 + d3/h3) equals 1, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the areas of the small triangles cut off by the hexagon sum up to a certain proportion of the total area.

Wait, but without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, maybe I should give up and look for an alternative method.

Wait, another idea: The hexagon can be seen as a translation of each side of the triangle inward by a certain distance, forming a smaller similar figure. But since the hexagon is equilateral, the translation distances must be such that the resulting sides are equal.

Wait, perhaps the side length 's' of the hexagon can be found using the formula s = (a * b * c) / (a + b + c), but as before, that gives a value larger than the triangle's sides, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the side length is the least common multiple or greatest common divisor of the triangle's sides, but 200, 240, 300 have a GCD of 20, which might be a possible answer. But 20 seems too small, as the hexagon is inside the triangle with sides up to 300.

Wait, actually, 20 is the GCD of 200, 240, and 300. So, perhaps the side length is 20. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me check: 200 ÷ 20 = 10, 240 ÷20=12, 300 ÷20=15. Hmm, but how would that relate to the hexagon's side length.

Wait, perhaps the hexagon's side length is 20, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the side length is 60, which is a divisor of all three sides.

Wait, 200 ÷ 60 ≈ 3.333, 240 ÷60=4, 300 ÷60=5. Hmm, 4 and 5 are factors, but 3.333 isn't an integer. So, maybe 60 isn't the right answer.

Wait, another approach: Using barycentric coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle and then find the hexagon's side length.

Wait, but this might take too long, and I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem in terms of affine transformations. If the hexagon is a transformed version of the triangle, scaled by some factor.

Wait, but I'm stuck. I think I need to find another approach.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that the hexagon's sides are parallel to the triangle's sides, and the hexagon is equilateral, the ratios of the hexagon's sides to the triangle's sides must be such that:

s/200 + s/240 + s/300 = 1.

But that's just a guess.

Wait, solving for s:

s*(1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300) = 1.

Compute the sum inside:

1/200 = 0.005

1/240 ≈ 0.0041667

1/300 ≈ 0.0033333

Sum ≈ 0.005 + 0.0041667 + 0.0033333 ≈ 0.0125.

So, s * 0.0125 = 1 → s = 1 / 0.0125 = 80.

Hmm, 80. That seems plausible.

Wait, so if s = 80, then the sides of the triangle would be 200, 240, 300, and the hexagon's sides would be 80, each parallel to a triangle side.

But does this make sense?

Wait, let me check if this satisfies the conditions.

If each side of the hexagon is 80, then the scaling factors would be:

For side 200: 80/200 = 0.4

For side 240: 80/240 ≈ 0.3333

For side 300: 80/300 ≈ 0.2667

But since the hexagon is equilateral, these scaling factors must somehow relate to each other in a way that the hexagon closes properly.

Wait, maybe the sum of the scaling factors is 1, but 0.4 + 0.3333 + 0.2667 ≈ 1.

Yes! 0.4 + 0.3333 + 0.2667 ≈ 1.

So, perhaps this is the correct approach.

Thus, the side length of the hexagon is 80.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The side length of the hexagon is found by solving \( s \left( \frac{1}{200} + \frac{1}{240} + \frac{1}{300} \right) = 1 \), which simplifies to \( s = 80 \).

\boxed{80}
