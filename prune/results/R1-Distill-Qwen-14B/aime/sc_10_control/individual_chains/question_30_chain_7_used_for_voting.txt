Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, 13th roots of unity... So ω is a complex number such that ω^13 = 1, right?

First, I remember that the 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation x^13 = 1. They can be written as ω^k for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 12, where ω = e^(2πi/13). So ω^k are the primitive roots except when k is a multiple of 13, but since k goes up to 12, we're covering all the non-1 roots as well.

The problem is asking for the product of terms of the form (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) for each k from 0 to 12. Wait, when k=0, ω^0 is 1, so the term becomes (2 - 2*1 + 1) which is (2 - 2 + 1) = 1. So that term is 1. So maybe the product simplifies a bit because of that.

For k=0, the term is 1, so the entire product is the same as the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). So perhaps I can focus on that part instead.

I need to compute the product over k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write that as the product over k=1 to 12 of [2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}]. Hmm, maybe there's a way to factor or manipulate this expression.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} can be rewritten in terms of ω^k. Let me set z = ω^k for each term. Then each term becomes 2 - 2z + z². So, for each z (which is a 13th root of unity, except z=1), the term is z² - 2z + 2.

So, the problem reduces to finding the product over all z ≠ 1 of (z² - 2z + 2). Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, the product over all z ≠ 1 can be related to the value of some polynomial evaluated at specific points.

I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over all primitive roots is equal to Φ_n(x), the nth cyclotomic polynomial. But in this case, we're considering all roots except 1, which includes both primitive and non-primitive roots. Wait, for n=13, which is prime, all roots except 1 are primitive. So Φ_13(x) is the minimal polynomial for ω, and it's equal to x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. So, the product over all (x - ω^k) for k=1 to 12 is Φ_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.

But in our case, we're dealing with (z² - 2z + 2) for each z being a root of x^13 = 1, except z=1. So perhaps we can relate this product to evaluating another polynomial at certain points.

Wait, another approach: if I have a polynomial P(z) = z² - 2z + 2, then the product over all z where z^13 = 1 and z ≠1 of P(z) would be equal to the product of P(z) over all roots of Φ_13(x). But since 13 is prime, all the roots except 1 are primitive, so Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider evaluating the product over all z^13=1 of P(z), which includes z=1, and then divide by P(1) to get the product over z≠1. So let me try that.

Compute the product over all z^13=1 of (z² - 2z + 2) = product_{k=0}^12 (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Then, the desired product is this product divided by (2 - 2*1 + 1^2) = (2 - 2 +1 ) =1. So the desired product is equal to product_{k=0}^12 (z² -2z +2) where z=ω^k.

So, how do I compute the product of P(z) over all z^13=1? That would be the same as evaluating the resultant of P(z) and z^13 -1, or perhaps using complex analysis or polynomials.

Wait, more formally, if I have a polynomial f(z) = z^13 -1, and another polynomial P(z) = z² -2z +2. Then, the product over all roots of f(z) of P(z) is equal to the resultant of f and P, but I'm not sure about the exact formula here.

Alternatively, I remember that for a monic polynomial f(z) with roots r_1, r_2, ..., r_n, the product of (a - r_i) over i is equal to f(a). Wait, but that's for linear factors. Here, P(z) is a quadratic, so perhaps I can think of the product over all roots z of f(z) of P(z) as the product over all z where z^13=1 of (z² -2z +2). So this would be equal to the value of the polynomial Q(x) = product_{z^13=1} (x - z) evaluated at x=... wait, but that's not directly applicable.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the product over z of (z² -2z +2) can be written as product_{z} (z - α)(z - β), where α and β are the roots of z² -2z +2=0. So if I let α and β be the roots, then the product becomes product_{z} (z - α)(z - β)}.

But the product over all z^13=1 of (z - α)(z - β) is equal to (product_{z^13=1} (z - α)) * (product_{z^13=1} (z - β))).

Each of these products is equal to f(α) where f(z) = z^13 -1, evaluated at z=α. So f(α) = α^13 -1. Similarly for f(β) = β^13 -1.

So the product over all z^13=1 of (z² -2z +2) is equal to (α^13 -1)(β^13 -1).

Now, since α and β are roots of z² -2z +2=0, we can compute α and β.

The quadratic equation z² -2z +2=0 has solutions:

z = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)]/2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)]/2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i.

So α = 1 + i and β = 1 - i.

So the product becomes (α^13 -1)(β^13 -1) = [(1 + i)^13 -1] * [(1 - i)^13 -1].

Now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

I remember that 1 + i can be represented in polar form. Let's compute the modulus and argument.

1 + i has modulus sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is π/4 since it's in the first quadrant.

Similarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -π/4.

So, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i *13 * π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i *13 * π/4}.

Compute [sqrt(2)]^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).

Now, the exponents:

13 * π/4 = (12 +1) * π/4 = 3π + π/4. Since angles are modulo 2π, 3π is equivalent to π (because 3π - 2π = π). So 13π/4 ≡ π + π/4 = 5π/4. Similarly, -13π/4 is equivalent to -5π/4, which is the same as 3π/4 (since adding 2π gives 7π/4, but 3π/4 is in the second quadrant, whereas 7π/4 is in the fourth. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, 13π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4. Since 3π is more than 2π, subtract 2π to get 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4.

Similarly, -13π/4 = -3π - π/4. Adding 2π to this, we get (-13π/4 + 8π/4) = (-5π/4 + 2π) = 3π/4.

Wait, no: Let me compute -13π/4 + 2π = (-13π/4 + 8π/4) = (-5π/4). Hmm, but negative angles can be converted by adding multiples of 2π.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute e^{i *13π/4} and e^{-i *13π/4}.

But 13π/4 = 3π + π/4. So, 3π is equivalent to π (since 3π = π + 2π), so 13π/4 is equivalent to π + π/4 = 5π/4. So, e^{i *13π/4} = e^{i *5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = (-√2/2) - i√2/2.

Similarly, e^{-i *13π/4} = e^{-i *5π/4} = cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4) = (-√2/2) + i√2/2.

Wait, let me verify:

Wait, 13π/4 is how much? Well, 2π is 8π/4, so 13π/4 is 8π/4 + 5π/4 = 2π + 5π/4, but that's more than 2π, so subtract 2π to get 5π/4. So, e^{i *13π/4} = e^{i *5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = (-√2/2) - i√2/2.

Similarly, e^{-i *13π/4} = e^{-i *5π/4} = cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4) = (-√2/2) + i√2/2.

So, now compute (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i *5π/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-√2/2) - i√2/2 ].

Let's compute that: sqrt(2)*(-√2/2) = (-2)/2 = -1. Similarly, sqrt(2)*(-i√2/2) = (-i*2)/2 = -i.

So (1 + i)^13 = 64 * ( -1 -i ) = -64 - 64i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i *5π/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-√2/2) + i√2/2 ].

Compute sqrt(2)*(-√2/2) = -1, and sqrt(2)*(i√2/2) = i.

So (1 - i)^13 = 64*(-1 + i) = -64 +64i.

Now, compute (1 + i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.

So the product is (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i). That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is the square of the modulus.

Compute the modulus squared: (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Wait: 65^2 is 4225, 64^2 is 4096. So 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

So the product is 8321. But wait, the product we computed is the product over all z^13=1 of (z² - 2z + 2) = 8321. But the desired product is the product from k=1 to 12, which is the same as product from z≠1, so we just divide by P(1). Wait, earlier I thought P(1) is 1, but let's check.

P(1) is (1)^2 - 2*(1) +2 = 1 -2 +2 =1. So yes, the product over all z^13=1 is 8321, and the product over z≠1 is 8321 /1 =8321.

Wait, but wait: The product over all z^13=1 of (z² - 2z +2) is 8321, so the product from k=0 to 12 is 8321. But in the problem statement, the product is from k=0 to 12, which includes k=0 (z=1), so that's the same as 8321. But earlier, I thought the product from k=0 to 12 is the same as the product over all z^13=1, which was 8321. So the answer is 8321. Then, the problem says to find the remainder when this is divided by 1000.

So 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with remainder 321. So the remainder is 321.

Wait, but let me double-check that computation because I might have made a mistake in calculating [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] and [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ].

Wait, (1 + i)^13: I thought it's (-64 -64i). Let me recalculate that.

We have (1 + i) in polar form: modulus sqrt(2), angle π/4. So (1 + i)^n = [sqrt(2)]^n * e^{i n π/4}.

So for n=13, [sqrt(2)]^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).

Angle is 13 * π/4. 13 divided by 8 is 1 with remainder 5, so 13π/4 = 3π + π/4. So angle is equivalent to π/4 + 3π = π/4 + π + π = 5π/4.

So the angle is 5π/4, which is in the third quadrant. So (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4)].

cos(5π/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5π/4) is -sqrt(2)/2.

So, 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.

Similarly, the imaginary part is 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) i = 64*(-1)*i = -64i.

So (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i. So (1 + i)^13 -1 is (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i 13π/4}.

13π/4 is 3π + π/4, so 13π/4 is equivalent to 5π/4, but since it's negative, perhaps I should compute as 13π/4 = 3π + π/4, so -13π/4 is -(3π + π/4) = -3π - π/4, which is the same as adding 2π: -3π - π/4 + 2π = (-π - π/4) = -5π/4. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute angle as positive by adding 2π: -5π/4 + 2π = 3π/4. Wait, but e^{-i13π/4} is the same as e^{-i(3π + π/4)} = e^{-iπ/4} * e^{-i3π} = e^{-iπ/4} * (-1), because e^{-i3π} is e^{-iπ} since 3π = π + 2π, so e^{-i3π} = e^{-iπ} = -1.

So, e^{-i13π/4} = e^{-iπ/4} * (-1) = (-1)*(cos(π/4) - i sin(π/4)) = (-1)*(√2/2 - i√2/2) = -√2/2 + i√2/2.

Then, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i13π/4} = 64*sqrt(2) * (-√2/2 + i√2/2).

Compute 64*sqrt(2) * (-√2/2) = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-2)/2 = -64.

Similarly, 64*sqrt(2)*(i√2/2) = 64*sqrt(2)*i*sqrt(2)/2 = 64*i*2/2 = 64i.

So (1 - i)^13 = -64 +64i. Then, (1 - i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.

So the product is (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2 * i^2). Since i^2 = -1, this becomes 4225 - (4096)*(-1) = 4225 +4096 = 8321.

So that's correct. So the product from k=0 to 12 is 8321, so the remainder when divided by 1000 is 8321 mod 1000.

Compute 8321 divided by 1000: 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321. So the remainder is 321.

Wait, but I should make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the initial step of thinking that the product over all z^13=1 of P(z) is equal to (α^13 -1)(β^13 -1). Let me check that again.

Yes, because if P(z) = (z - α)(z - β), then the product over all roots z of z^13=1 of P(z) is product_{z} (z - α)(z - β) = [product_{z} (z - α)] * [product_{z} (z - β)].

Each product is f(α) and f(β), where f(z) = z^13 -1. Because f(z) = product_{k=0}^{12} (z - ω^k). So for any a, product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^13 -1. So yes, product_{z} (z - α) = α^13 -1, and same for β.

So that step is correct.

Thus, the final remainder is 321.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we need to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity.

First, we recognize that the 13th roots of unity satisfy \(\omega^{13} = 1\). The term for \(k=0\) is 1, so the product simplifies to \(\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\).

We rewrite each term as \(2 - 2z + z^2\) where \(z = \omega^k\). The product becomes \(\prod_{z^13=1, z\neq1}(z^2 - 2z + 2)\).

The polynomial \(z^2 - 2z + 2\) has roots \(1 + i\) and \(1 - i\). The product over all 13th roots of unity (including 1) of \(z^2 - 2z + 2\) is \(( (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ) \times ( (1 - i)^{13} - 1 )\).

Calculating \((1 + i)^{13}\) and \((1 - i)^{13}\) in polar form:
- \(1 + i\) has modulus \(\sqrt{2}\) and angle \(\pi/4\), so \((1 + i)^{13} = 64\sqrt{2} \cdot e^{i \cdot 5\pi/4} = -64 - 64i\).
- \(1 - i\) has modulus \(\sqrt{2}\) and angle \(-\pi/4\), so \((1 - i)^{13} = 64\sqrt{2} \cdot e^{-i \cdot 5\pi/4} = -64 + 64i\).

Thus, \((1 + i)^{13} - 1 = -65 - 64i\) and \((1 - i)^{13} - 1 = -65 + 64i\). Their product is \((-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = 65^2 + 64^2 = 8321\).

Finally, dividing 8321 by 1000 leaves a remainder of 321.

\[\boxed{321}\]
