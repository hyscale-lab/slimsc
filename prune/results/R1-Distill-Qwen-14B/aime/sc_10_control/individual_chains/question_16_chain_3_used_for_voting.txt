Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p². Finally, I have to provide this m as the answer.

Hmm. So, first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n^4 + 1 for some n. Then, with that p, find the smallest m where m^4 +1 is divisible by p².

Alright, let's take it step by step.

First, understanding the question: For primes p, I need to check if p² divides any n^4 +1. The smallest such prime p is what I'm looking for first. Once I have p, I then look for the smallest m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by p².

I think I should start by checking small primes and see if any satisfy the condition that p² divides some n^4 +1.

The primes in order are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.

So let's check for each prime p whether there exists an n such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod p².

I remember that for primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p², such an n exists. But maybe I should compute it for small primes.

Starting with p=2.

Check p=2: p²=4.

We need to find n where n^4 +1 ≡0 mod 4.

But n^4: Let's compute n modulo 4.

If n is even, say n=2k: (2k)^4 = 16k^4 ≡0 mod4. So n^4 +1 ≡1 mod4. Not 0.

If n is odd, n=2k+1: (2k+1)^4. Let's compute that.

(2k+1)^4 = 16k^4 + 32k^3 + 24k^2 + 8k +1. All terms except 1 are multiples of 4. So modulo 4, it's 1. So n^4 +1 ≡1+1=2 mod4. Not 0.

So for p=2, there is no n such that n^4 +1 is divisible by 4. So p=2 is out.

Next, p=3.

p=3, p²=9.

We need to find n such that n^4 ≡-1 mod9.

Compute n^4 mod9 for n=1 to 8 (since mod9 cycles every 9 numbers).

n=1: 1^4=1 →1 mod9. 1≡-1 mod9? No, because 1+1=2≠0 mod9.

n=2: 2^4=16 →7 mod9. 7≡-1? 7+1=8≠0 mod9. No.

n=3: 3^4=81→0 mod9. 0+1=1≠0. No.

n=4: 4^4=256. 256/9=28*9=252, 256-252=4. So 4 mod9. 4+1=5≠0.

n=5: 5^4=625. 625/9=69*9=621, 625-621=4. So 4 mod9. 4+1=5≠0.

n=6: 6^4=1296. 1296 mod9=0. 0+1=1≠0.

n=7: 7^4=2401. 2401-266*9=2401-2394=7. So 7 mod9. 7+1=8≠0.

n=8: 8^4=4096. 4096 mod9. Let's see: 9*455=4095, so 4096≡1 mod9. 1+1=2≠0.

So none of n=1 to 8 satisfy n^4 ≡-1 mod9. So p=3 is out.

Next prime, p=5.

p=5, p²=25.

Check if there exists an n where n^4 ≡-1 mod25.

Compute n^4 mod25 for n from 1 to 24.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Since 25 is 5², perhaps Fermat's little theorem applies. But wait, Euler's theorem says that for n coprime to 25, n^φ(25)=n^20 ≡1 mod25. So n^4 cycles with some period dividing 20.

Alternatively, maybe I can find n such that n^4 ≡24 mod25.

Let me compute n^4 mod25 for n=1 to 12, since after that it's symmetric.

n=1: 1 →1 mod25

n=2: 16 mod25

n=3: 81 mod25=81-3*25=6 →6

n=4: 256 mod25. 256-10*25=256-250=6 →6

n=5: 0 mod25

n=6: 6^4=1296 mod25. 1296 - 51*25=1296-1275=21→21

n=7: 7^4=2401. 2401 mod25: 2401 - 96*25=2401-2400=1→1

n=8: 8^4=4096. 4096 mod25. 4096-163*25=4096-4075=21→21

n=9: 9^4=6561 mod25. 6561 - 262*25=6561-6550=11→11

n=10: 0 mod25

n=11: 11^4=14641. 14641 mod25. 14641-585*25=14641-14625=16→16

n=12: 12^4=20736. 20736 mod25. 20736-829*25=20736-20725=11→11

Wait, so looking at n=1 to 12, the residues are:

1:1

2:16

3:6

4:6

5:0

6:21

7:1

8:21

9:11

10:0

11:16

12:11

Hmm. So for n=1 to 12, n^4 mod25 cycles through these residues. I don't see a 24 mod25, which would be equivalent to -1.

Wait, so is there no n where n^4 ≡24 mod25? Hmm.

Wait, let me check n=7: n^4 mod25 is 1. n=2:16, n=3:6, n=4:6, n=6:21, n=8:21, n=9:11, n=11:16, n=12:11.

I don't see a 24. Maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of modular arithmetic properties.

We need n^4 ≡-1 mod25.

But 25 is 5². Let me first consider mod5.

If n^4 ≡-1 mod5.

But in mod5, n^4 must be 0 or 1, because Fermat's little theorem says n^4≡1 mod5 if n not divisible by 5.

But -1 mod5 is 4. So n^4 ≡4 mod5. But n^4 mod5 can be only 0 or 1?

Wait, no. Let's compute n^4 mod5 for n=1 to 4.

n=1:1^4=1 mod5.

n=2:16 mod5=1.

n=3:81 mod5=1.

n=4:256 mod5=1.

So n^4 mod5 is 0 if n is multiple of 5, else 1.

So n^4 can't be 4 mod5. Therefore, it's impossible for n^4 ≡-1 mod5. Therefore, n^4 ≡-1 mod25 is also impossible, because if it were, it would imply n^4≡-1 mod5, which is impossible.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, if n^4 ≡-1 mod25, then certainly n^4≡-1 mod5, because 25 is a multiple of 5. But since n^4 cannot be -1 mod5, as we saw, it's impossible for n^4 ≡-1 mod25. Therefore, p=5 does not satisfy the condition.

So p=5 is out.

Next prime, p=7.

p=7, p²=49.

We need to find n such that n^4 ≡-1 mod49.

Again, let's check mod7 first. Because if n^4 ≡-1 mod7, that's necessary for it to hold mod49.

Compute n^4 mod7.

n from 1 to 6 (since mod7):

n=1:1

n=2:16 mod7=2

n=3:81 mod7=81-11*7=81-77=4

n=4:256 mod7: 256-36*7=256-252=4

n=5:625 mod7: 625-89*7=625-623=2

n=6:1296 mod7: 1296-185*7=1296-1295=1

So n^4 mod7: 1,2,4,4,2,1 for n=1 to6.

Looking for n^4≡-1 mod7. Since -1 mod7 is 6.

But in the residues above, n^4 mod7 is 1,2,4, so 6 is not among them. So there is no n with n^4≡6 mod7, which is -1 mod7. Therefore, no solution mod7, let alone mod49. So p=7 is out.

Next prime, p=11.

p=11, p²=121.

We need to check if there exists n where n^4 ≡-1 mod121.

Again, let's check mod11 first. Because if n^4 ≡-1 mod11, then it might hold mod121.

Compute n^4 mod11 for n=1 to10.

n=1:1

n=2:16 mod11=5

n=3:81 mod11=4

n=4:256 mod11=256-23*11=256-253=3

n=5:625 mod11. 625-56*11=625-616=9

n=6:1296 mod11. 1296-117*11=1296-1287=9

Wait, wait, 6^4=1296.

Wait, 1296 ÷11: 11*117=1287, 1296-1287=9.

Similarly, n=7:7^4=2401 mod11.

2401 ÷11: 11*218=2398, 2401-2398=3. So 3 mod11.

n=8:8^4=4096 mod11.

4096 ÷11: 11*372=4092, 4096-4092=4.

n=9:9^4=6561 mod11.

6561 ÷11: 11*596=6556, 6561-6556=5.

n=10:10^4=10000 mod11.

10000 ÷11: 11*909=9999, 10000-9999=1.

So n^4 mod11 for n=1 to10: 1,5,4,3,9,9,3,4,5,1.

Looking for n^4 ≡-1 mod11. Since -1 mod11 is 10.

Looking at the residues: 1,5,4,3,9,9,3,4,5,1. No 10's. So no n exists with n^4 ≡10 mod11. Therefore, no solution mod11, so p=11 is out.

Next prime, p=13.

p=13, p²=169.

We need to check if any n satisfies n^4 ≡-1 mod169.

Again, let's check mod13 first.

Compute n^4 mod13 for n=1 to12.

Using Fermat's little theorem, n^12≡1 mod13 if n not divisible by13.

So n^4 can be a fourth root of 1 mod13. So possible residues are 1, 8, 5, 12?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute n^4 for n=1 to12:

n=1:1

n=2:16 mod13=3

n=3:81 mod13=81-6*13=81-78=3

n=4:256 mod13. 256 ÷13: 13*19=247, 256-247=9.

n=5:625 mod13. 625-48*13=625-624=1.

n=6:1296 mod13. 1296 ÷13: 13*99=1287, 1296-1287=9.

n=7:7^4=2401 mod13.

2401 ÷13: 13*184=2392, 2401-2392=9.

Wait, 7^4= (7^2)^2=49²=2401. 2401 mod13: Let's compute 49 mod13: 49-3*13=10. So 49≡10 mod13. Then 10²=100 mod13: 100-7*13=100-91=9. So 7^4 ≡9 mod13.

n=8:8^4=4096 mod13.

Compute 8 mod13=8. 8²=64 mod13=12. 12²=144 mod13=1. So 8^4≡1 mod13.

n=9:9^4. 9²=81≡3 mod13. 3²=9 mod13. So 9^4≡9 mod13.

n=10:10^4. 10²=100≡9 mod13. 9²=81≡3 mod13. So 10^4≡3 mod13.

n=11: 11^4. 11²=121≡4 mod13. 4²=16≡3 mod13. So 11^4≡3 mod13.

n=12:12^4. 12²=144≡1 mod13. 1²=1 mod13. So 12^4≡1 mod13.

So n^4 mod13:

n:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

mod13:1,3,3,9,1,9,9,1,9,3,3,1.

Looking for n^4 ≡-1 mod13. Since -1 mod13=12.

Looking at the residues: 1,3,3,9,1,9,9,1,9,3,3,1. No 12's. Therefore, no n exists with n^4 ≡12 mod13. Hence, p=13 is out.

Next prime, p=17.

Wait, wait. Maybe I'm going too far. Let's think about a different approach.

I recall that for primes p where p ≡1 mod8, the equation x^4 ≡-1 mod p has solutions. Because the multiplicative order of x must divide (p-1)/2, which must be even for x^4 to be -1.

Wait, let me think. If p is a prime where 8 divides p-1, i.e., p≡1 mod8, then the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1, which is a multiple of8. So the equation x^4 = -1 can have solutions.

But for the modulus p², we need to see if the solutions can be lifted from mod p to mod p².

This is where Hensel's lemma comes into play. If f(x) =x^4 +1, and if f(n)≡0 mod p, and f'(n) not ≡0 mod p, then we can lift the solution to mod p².

But for p= primes where 8 divides p-1, and f(n)≡0 mod p, let's see.

So perhaps the smallest prime p where p≡1 mod8 is p=17.

Wait, 17 is 1 mod8: 17-1=16, which is 8*2. So yes.

Let me check p=17.

So first, check if n^4 ≡-1 mod17 has a solution.

Compute n^4 mod17 for n=1 to16.

But perhaps, using properties of exponents. Since 17 is prime, and the multiplicative group is cyclic of order16.

We can represent -1 as an element of order2. So to have x^4 = -1, the order of x must divide 8, since (x^4)^2 = x^8 = 1. So x must have order 8.

So, if the multiplicative group mod17 has an element of order8, then there exists an x with x^8=1, and x^4=-1.

Since 16 is the order of the group, and 8 divides16, yes, it has elements of order8.

Therefore, solutions exist.

So, to find n such that n^4 ≡-1 mod17.

Let me compute n^4 mod17 for n=1 to16.

Alternatively, note that primitive roots mod17 can help. Let me take g=3 as a primitive root mod17.

Compute 3^k mod17:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^4=81 mod17=13

3^8=13^2=169 mod17=16

3^16=1 mod17.

So, 3 is a primitive root.

So, to find x such that x^4 ≡-1 mod17.

Express x as 3^k.

Then x^4 =3^{4k} ≡-1 mod17.

We have 3^8≡16≡-1 mod17.

So 3^{8}≡-1.

Therefore, 3^{8}≡-1. So, if x=3^{2}, since 3^{2}=9, then x^4=9^4= (3^2)^4=3^8≡-1 mod17.

So n=9 is such that 9^4 ≡-1 mod17.

Indeed, let's compute 9^4 mod17.

9^2=81 mod17=13.

9^4=(13)^2=169 mod17=16≡-1 mod17.

Yes, that's correct.

So, n=9 is a solution mod17.

Now, we need to check if this can be lifted to a solution mod17²=289.

So, using Hensel's lemma.

Hensel's lemma says that if f(n) ≡0 mod p and f'(n) not ≡0 mod p, then there's a unique lift to mod p².

f(x)=x^4 +1.

f'(x)=4x³.

At x=9 mod17, f(9)=9^4 +1 ≡-1 +1=0 mod17.

f'(9)=4*9³ mod17.

Compute 9³ mod17.

9²=81≡13 mod17.

9³=9*13=117≡117-6*17=117-102=15 mod17.

So f'(9)=4*15=60 mod17.

60 ÷17=3*17=51, 60-51=9. So f'(9)=9 mod17.

Which is not 0 mod17. So Hensel's applies, and there's a unique lift of 9 mod17 to mod289.

So, the solution mod289 is of the form n=9 +17k, and we can find k such that n^4 ≡-1 mod289.

So, substitute n=9 +17k into f(n)=n^4 +1.

We need to compute (9 +17k)^4 +1 ≡0 mod289.

But since 17²=289, any term with (17k)^2 or higher power will be 0 mod289.

So, when expanding (9 +17k)^4, only the first two terms will contribute to mod289.

Using the binomial theorem:

(9 +17k)^4 =9^4 + 4*9^3*(17k) + 6*9²*(17k)^2 + ... higher terms, which are 0 mod289.

So, mod289, it's equal to:

9^4 + 4*9^3*(17k) mod289.

We know that 9^4 ≡-1 mod17, but we need to compute mod289.

Compute 9^4:

9²=81, 81²=6561.

6561 ÷289: 289*22=6358, 6561-6358=203. So 9^4=6561≡203 mod289.

So, 9^4 +1=203 +1=204 mod289. So, 204 ≡0 mod289? No, because 204 <289. So, we need to find k such that 204 + 4*9^3*17k ≡0 mod289.

Compute 4*9^3*17:

First, compute 9^3=729. 729 mod289: 289*2=578, 729-578=151. So 9^3≡151 mod289.

Then, 4*151=604.

Multiply by 17: 604*17.

Compute 600*17=10200, 4*17=68, so total 10268.

Now, 10268 mod289.

Compute how many times 289 goes into 10268.

289*35=10115.

10268-10115=153.

So, 4*9^3*17 ≡153 mod289.

So, the equation becomes:

204 +153k ≡0 mod289.

So, 153k ≡-204 mod289.

But -204 mod289 is 289-204=85.

So, 153k ≡85 mod289.

We need to solve for k: 153k ≡85 mod289.

First, find the inverse of 153 mod289.

Compute GCD(153,289).

289 ÷153=1 with remainder 136.

153 ÷136=1 with remainder17.

136 ÷17=8 exactly. So GCD is17.

Wait, that can't be. 17 divides both 153 and 289.

Wait, 153=9*17, and 289=17². So GCD is17.

Therefore, 153k ≡85 mod289.

But 17 divides 153, 85, and 289.

So, divide the entire equation by17:

153/17=9,

85/17=5,

289/17=17.

So, 9k ≡5 mod17.

Now, solve 9k ≡5 mod17.

Find inverse of9 mod17.

9*x ≡1 mod17.

Testing x=2: 9*2=18≡1 mod17. So inverse is2.

Multiply both sides: k≡5*2=10 mod17.

So, k=10 +17m, for integer m.

Therefore, the smallest positive k is10.

So, substituting back into n=9 +17k, we get n=9 +17*10=9+170=179.

So, n=179 is a solution mod289.

Wait, but we need the minimal positive integer m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by289.

But 179 is less than289, so it's the minimal solution?

Wait, maybe not. Let me check if there's a smaller positive integer m <179 that satisfies m^4 ≡-1 mod289.

But since Hensel's lemma gives a unique lift, and we started with n=9 mod17, the lift is n=9 +17*10=179 mod289.

So, the minimal positive solution is179.

Wait, but could there be a smaller m? Let me check m=9.

Compute 9^4=6561.

6561 ÷289: 289*22=6358, 6561-6358=203. So 9^4 ≡203 mod289.

203 +1=204≡204 mod289≠0.

So, 9 isn't a solution.

Wait, so the minimal m is179.

But let me confirm by computing 179^4 mod289.

Wait, that's a big computation. Maybe I can compute 179 mod289, which is179.

Compute 179^2 mod289.

179^2=32041.

Compute 32041 ÷289:

289*100=28900, 32041-28900=3141.

289*10=2890, 3141-2890=251.

So, 32041=289*110 +251. So, 179²≡251 mod289.

Now, compute (179²)^2=251² mod289.

251²=63001.

Compute 63001 ÷289:

289*217=289*(200+17)=289*200=57800, 289*17=4913. So 57800+4913=62713.

63001-62713=288.

So, 251²≡288 mod289.

Thus, 179^4 ≡288 mod289.

288 +1=289≡0 mod289.

Yes, so 179^4 +1≡0 mod289.

So, m=179 is a solution.

Now, is there a smaller m? Let's see.

Since the solution is unique mod289, the minimal positive solution is the smallest positive integer in the congruence class, which is179.

So, the minimal m is179.

But wait, before confirming, let me check if p=17 is indeed the least prime where p² divides some n^4 +1.

Because earlier primes up to13 didn't work, and next prime after13 is17.

So yes, p=17 is the least such prime.

Therefore, the least positive integer m is179.

Wait, but is there a smaller m than179? Hmm, the solution mod289 is unique, so 179 is the smallest positive integer solution.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me recheck the step where I solved 153k≡85 mod289.

I divided by17 and got 9k≡5 mod17.

Inverse of9 mod17 is2, so k≡10 mod17.

So, k=10 +17m.

Wait, but m is an integer, so the smallest positive k is10.

So, n=9 +17*10=179.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can check if m=179 is the minimal solution.

Alternatively, perhaps 179 is correct.

Wait, but 179 is less than 289, so it's the minimal positive solution.

So, to recap:

The least prime p is17, and the minimal m is179.

But wait, wait a second. Let me check if p=  17 is indeed the least prime. Because earlier, I thought p=  17 is the first prime after checking p=2,3,5,7,11,13.

Wait, 2,3,5,7,11,13,17. So yes, 17 is the next prime after13, and since none of the primes before17 worked, 17 is indeed the minimal p.

Therefore, the minimal m is179.

But wait, wait, I think I might have confused something.

Because when I started, I thought that p=17 is the minimal prime, so m=179 is the minimal m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by17²=289.

But the problem says, "Let p be the least prime... such that n^4 +1 is divisible by p². Find the least positive integer m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by p²."

So, yes, p=17, so m=179.

But wait, is 179 the minimal m? Because in mod289, 179 is the solution, but maybe another number less than179 also satisfies m^4 ≡-1 mod289.

But Hensel's lemma tells us that the solution is unique. Because when lifting, since the derivative f'(n)=4n³ was not zero mod17, the solution is unique mod17². So, the minimal solution is the one found, which is179.

Alternatively, perhaps I can check m=179-289= -110, but that's negative. So, the minimal positive is179.

Wait, but 179 is more than half of289. So, is there a smaller positive integer m less than179 such that m^4 ≡-1 mod289?

Wait, perhaps m=179 -289= -110, but that's negative. Alternatively, maybe m=179 -289= -110, which is equivalent to 179 mod289.

So, perhaps 179 is the minimal positive solution.

Wait, perhaps I can test m=100.

Compute 100^4 mod289.

But that's tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a smaller m.

Wait, but given that Hensel's lemma gives a unique solution, and the initial solution is9 mod17, which lifts to179 mod289, I think 179 is indeed the minimal positive integer.

But wait, let me think again. Maybe the minimal positive integer is actually 9 mod17, but when lifted, it's179. But 9 is less than179, but 9 doesn't satisfy mod289.

Because 9^4 +1=6561+1=6562. 6562 ÷289: 289*22=6358, 6562-6358=204. So 6562≡204 mod289, which is not 0. So 9 is not a solution mod289. So the minimal m is179.

Therefore, after all this thinking, I conclude that p=17 is the least prime, and the minimal m is179.

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) where \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \). Once \( p \) is identified, we then determine the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

**Step 1: Identifying the smallest prime \( p \)**

We start by checking small primes to see if \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \).

- **For \( p = 2 \):** \( p^2 = 4 \). Checking \( n^4 \mod 4 \), we find no \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \).
- **For \( p = 3 \):** \( p^2 = 9 \). Checking \( n^4 \mod 9 \) for \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), none satisfy \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 9 \).
- **For \( p = 5 \):** \( p^2 = 25 \). Checking \( n^4 \mod 25 \), no \( n \) satisfies \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 25 \).
- **For \( p = 7 \):** \( p^2 = 49 \). Checking \( n^4 \mod 7 \), no \( n \) satisfies \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \).
- **For \( p = 11 \):** \( p^2 = 121 \). Checking \( n^4 \mod 11 \), no \( n \) satisfies \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 11 \).
- **For \( p = 13 \):** \( p^2 = 169 \). Checking \( n^4 \mod 13 \), no \( n \) satisfies \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 13 \).
- **For \( p = 17 \):** \( p^2 = 289 \). Checking \( n^4 \mod 17 \), we find \( n = 9 \) satisfies \( 9^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 17 \).

Thus, \( p = 17 \) is the smallest prime where \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \).

**Step 2: Finding the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \)**

Using Hensel's Lemma, we lift the solution \( n = 9 \) modulo 17 to modulo 289. Let \( n = 9 + 17k \). Expanding \( (9 + 17k)^4 + 1 \mod 289 \), we find that \( k = 10 \) satisfies the equation. Thus, \( n = 9 + 17 \times 10 = 179 \).

**Conclusion:**

The smallest prime \( p \) is 17, and the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \) is 179.

\boxed{179}
