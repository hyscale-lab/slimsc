Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies ω^13 = 1, and all the lower powers don't equal 1. So, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. That might come in handy later.

Now, looking at the product, it's a product over all 13th roots of unity, except for ω^0 = 1, right? Wait, no, the product is from k=0 to 12, so it includes ω^0 as well. So, that's the full set of 13th roots of unity, including 1. But wait, the problem says ω ≠ 1, but the product is from k=0 to 12, which would include k=0, which is 1. Hmm, maybe I misread that. Let me check.

No, the problem says ω ≠ 1 is a 13th root of unity, and the product is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). So, for each k, ω^k is a 13th root of unity, and k=0 gives ω^0=1. So, the term when k=0 is (2 - 2*1 + 1^2) = (2 - 2 + 1) = 1. So that term is 1, which doesn't affect the product.

So, the product is equal to the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) because the k=0 term is 1. So, that might simplify things a bit.

Next, I should think about how to compute this product. Maybe I can express each term as a polynomial evaluated at ω^k, and then evaluate the product as a product over all roots. Let's see.

Let me look at the expression 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Hmm, can I factor this or relate it to a polynomial?

Wait, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} can be written as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Maybe I can factor it. Let me try to see if it's a quadratic in ω^k.

Let me denote x = ω^k. Then, the expression becomes x² - 2x + 2. So, each term is x² - 2x + 2 evaluated at x = ω^k. So, the product is the product from k=1 to 12 of (x² - 2x + 2) where x = ω^k.

But since ω^k are all the 13th roots of unity except 1, maybe I can relate this product to the value of a certain polynomial evaluated at all the roots.

Wait, the product over (x - ω^k) for k=1 to 12 would be equal to Φ₁₃(x), the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But in this case, the terms are (x² - 2x + 2), not (x - ω^k). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the product as the product of (x² - 2x + 2) evaluated at each 13th root of unity except 1. So, maybe I can write this as evaluating the resultant or something similar.

Wait, another thought: The product over (x² - 2x + 2) for x = ω^k, k=1 to 12, is the same as the product over (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). So, that's the same as the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that x² - 2x + 2 is a quadratic, and perhaps the product over all roots can be found by evaluating some polynomial at certain points.

Wait, perhaps consider that if I have a polynomial P(x) = x² - 2x + 2, then the product over P(ω^k) for k=1 to 12 would be equal to the product over P(ω^k) for all k from 1 to 12.

But since ω is a primitive 13th root, the minimal polynomial is Φ₁₃(x) as I thought earlier. So, perhaps I can relate this to evaluating P(x) over all the roots of Φ₁₃(x).

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that since Φ₁₃(x) is the product from k=1 to 12 of (x - ω^k), then the product over P(ω^k) would be the product of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2), but I'm not sure how to connect that.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the product as follows: Since each term is P(ω^k) = (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2, the product over all k=1 to 12 would be the product over P(ω^k). So, that's the same as evaluating the product over all roots of Φ₁₃(x) of P(x).

I think there's a theorem or formula that says that the product of P(α_i) over all roots α_i of another polynomial Q(x) is equal to the resultant of P and Q or something like that.

Wait, actually, I remember that if you have a polynomial Q(x) with roots α_i, then the product over (c - α_i) is Q(c). But in this case, our Q(x) is Φ₁₃(x), and each term is P(α_i) where P(x) is a quadratic. Hmm, maybe not directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product over P(ω^k) for k=1 to 12 is equal to the resultant of Φ₁₃(x) and P(x). But I'm not too sure about that.

Wait, another approach: Since Φ₁₃(x) is the minimal polynomial, and ω^k are its roots, then perhaps the product over (a - ω^k) from k=1 to 12 is equal to Φ₁₃(a). So, that's when P(x) is linear. But here, P(x) is quadratic. Maybe I can express P(x) in terms of Φ₁₃.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product over (x² - 2x + 2) evaluated at x = ω^k for k=1 to 12 is the same as the product over (x^2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at each root of Φ₁₃(x).

Wait, another thought: Let me factor P(x) = x² - 2x + 2. Let's compute its roots. The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 ± i. So, P(x) factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

So, the product over P(ω^k) is the product from k=1 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). Hmm, that's the same as the product of (ω^k - (1 + i)) times the product of (ω^k - (1 - i)).

But the product of (x - ω^k) for k=1 to 12 is Φ₁₃(x). So, if I let x = 1 + i, then the product over (1 + i - ω^k) is Φ₁₃(1 + i), and similarly for 1 - i.

So, the product over P(ω^k) is [Φ₁₃(1 + i)] * [Φ₁₃(1 - i)].

Since Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1, I can compute Φ₁₃(1 + i) and Φ₁₃(1 - i), then multiply them together.

So, the product we're looking for is Φ₁₃(1 + i) * Φ₁₃(1 - i).

Now, let me compute Φ₁₃(x) at x = 1 + i and x = 1 - i.

First, let's compute Φ₁₃(x). Since Φ₁₃(x) is (x¹³ - 1)/(x - 1). So, Φ₁₃(x) = (x¹³ - 1)/(x - 1).

Therefore, Φ₁₃(1 + i) = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]/[(1 + i) - 1] = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]/(i).

Similarly, Φ₁₃(1 - i) = [(1 - i)^13 - 1]/[(1 - i) - 1] = [(1 - i)^13 - 1]/(-i).

So, now I need to compute (1 + i)^13, (1 - i)^13, and then plug them into these expressions.

First, let's compute (1 + i)^13.

I know that 1 + i can be represented in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is π/4 radians.

So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}.

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13π/4}.

Similarly, [sqrt(2)]^13 is (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

The exponent e^{i * 13π/4} can be simplified by subtracting multiples of 2π. 13π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4, which is the same as π/4 (since 3π is equivalent to π modulo 2π). But wait, 13π/4 divided by 2π is 13/8, so subtract 2π (which is 8π/4) once: 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4. So, 5π/4 is in the third quadrant.

So, e^{i * 5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].

Let me compute that:

First, 64 * sqrt(2) multiplied by (-sqrt(2)/2) is 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.

Similarly, 64 * sqrt(2) multiplied by (-i sqrt(2)/2) is 64*(-i)(2)/2 = 64*(-i) = -64i.

So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.

Then, (1 + i)^13 - 1 = (-64 - 64i) - 1 = -65 - 64i.

Similarly, let's compute (1 - i)^13.

1 - i is also sqrt(2) in modulus, but with an argument of -π/4.

So, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-iπ/4}.

Therefore, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13π/4}.

Again, [sqrt(2)]^13 is 64 * sqrt(2).

Now, the exponent e^{-i * 13π/4} can be simplified. 13π/4 is the same as 5π/4 when considering positive angles, but since it's negative, it's equivalent to e^{-i * 5π/4}.

Which is cos(-5π/4) + i sin(-5π/4) = cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.

So, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].

Multiplying that out:

64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-2)/2 = -64.

64 * sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*i*(2)/2 = 64i.

So, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.

Then, (1 - i)^13 - 1 = (-64 + 64i) - 1 = -65 + 64i.

Now, going back to Φ₁₃(1 + i) and Φ₁₃(1 - i):

Φ₁₃(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( -65 - 64i ) / (i )

Similarly, Φ₁₃(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ( -65 + 64i ) / ( -i )

Let's compute these.

First, Φ₁₃(1 + i) = (-65 -64i)/i.

To simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

(-65 -64i)/i = (-65 -64i)*(-i) / (i*(-i)) = (65i + 64i^2)/1 = 65i -64.

Since i^2 = -1.

So, Φ₁₃(1 + i) = -64 +65i.

Similarly, Φ₁₃(1 - i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i).

Multiply numerator and denominator by i:

(-65 +64i)*i / (-i * i) = (-65i +64i^2)/1 = -65i -64.

So, Φ₁₃(1 - i) = -64 -65i.

Now, the product Φ₁₃(1 + i) * Φ₁₃(1 - i) = (-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i).

This is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to the square of the modulus.

Which is (-64)^2 + (65)^2.

Compute that:

(-64)^2 = 4096

65^2 = 4225

Sum: 4096 + 4225 = 8321.

Wait, that's 8321? Let me check the addition: 4096 + 4225.

Compute 4000 + 4200 = 8200, 96 +25=121. So, 8200+121=8321. Yes.

So, the product is 8321.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, (-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225)(i^2) = 4096 - (4225)(-1) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321. Yes, that's correct.

So, the product over P(ω^k) from k=1 to 12 is 8321.

But wait, the original product was from k=0 to 12, but the term at k=0 was 1, so the entire product is 8321.

Wait, no. Wait, earlier I said that the product from k=0 to 12 is the same as the product from k=1 to 12 because k=0 term is 1. So, yes, the entire product is 8321.

Wait, but let me confirm. So, the product is 8321.

But the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000.

So, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321.

So, the remainder is 321.

Wait, let me just confirm all steps once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. The product is given as ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Since when k=0, ω^0=1, so the term is 2-2+1=1, which doesn't affect the product. So, it's equivalent to ∏_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

2. Each term can be written as x² - 2x + 2 where x=ω^k.

3. The product over k=1 to 12 of (x² - 2x + 2) evaluated at x=ω^k is equal to Φ₁₃(1+i) * Φ₁₃(1-i), where Φ₁₃(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial.

4. Calculated Φ₁₃(1+i) = (-65 -64i)/i = -64 +65i.

5. Similarly, Φ₁₃(1-i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i) = -64 -65i.

6. Product of these two is (-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i) = (64)^2 + (65)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.

7. 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, with remainder 321.

So, the remainder is 321. Therefore, the answer is 321.

I think this is correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, I'll go with 321.

The problem requires finding the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity.

First, note that the term when \(k=0\) is 1, so the product simplifies to \(\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\). Each term can be expressed as \(P(\omega^k)\) where \(P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\). 

The product of \(P(\omega^k)\) for all \(k=1\) to \(12\) is equivalent to evaluating the resultant of \(P(x)\) at all roots of the 13th cyclotomic polynomial \(\Phi_{13}(x)\). This is computed as \(\Phi_{13}(1+i) \cdot \Phi_{13}(1-i)\).

Using the cyclotomic polynomial \(\Phi_{13}(x) = \frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1}\), we compute:
- \(\Phi_{13}(1+i) = \frac{(1+i)^{13} - 1}{i} = -64 + 65i\),
- \(\Phi_{13}(1-i) = \frac{(1-i)^{13} - 1}{-i} = -64 - 65i\).

The product is:
\[
(-64 + 65i)(-64 - 65i) = (-64)^2 + (65)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.
\]

Finally, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is:
\[
8321 \mod 1000 = 321.
\]

The remainder is \(\boxed{321}\).
