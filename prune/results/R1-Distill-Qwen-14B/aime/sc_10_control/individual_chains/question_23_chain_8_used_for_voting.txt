Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand what it's asking.

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, basically, I need to find the infimum of BD², which is the lower bound for BD² across all possible such rhombi, and then take the greatest number less than that. Wait, no, actually, since it's the greatest number less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, maybe I need to find the minimum value of BD², and then the answer would be that minimum. Or perhaps the supremum of the lower bounds? Let me think.

Wait, the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, if BD² can get as low as some number, say m, then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be m itself, because for all rhombi, BD² is at least m. So, the answer would be m. So, I think I'm to find the minimum possible value of BD², given the conditions.

But let me make sure. So, maybe BD² can vary, but we need the greatest number that is less than BD² for all possible rhombi. So, if BD² has a lower bound, say m, then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be m. Because BD² cannot be less than m, so m is the infimum, and the greatest number less than all BD² is m.

So, in any case, I need to find the minimum value of BD².

So, the rhombus is ABCD, with diagonals intersecting at the origin. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, yes, I think that's correct. Because in a rhombus, which is a type of parallelogram with all sides equal, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, they intersect at right angles.

So, given that, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, and are perpendicular. Points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Since the rhombus is symmetric about the origin, the points are arranged such that if A is (x,y), then C is (-x,-y), right? Because the diagonals bisect each other at the origin.

Similarly, points B and D would be symmetric with respect to the origin as well. So, if B is (u,v), then D is (-u,-v).

So, the four points are A(x,y), B(u,v), C(-x,-y), D(-u,-v).

Now, in a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

So, let's compute the distances.

First, distance AB: between (x,y) and (u,v). It's sqrt[(x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2].

Distance BC: between (u,v) and (-x,-y). That's sqrt[(u + x)^2 + (v + y)^2].

Since AB = BC, we can set these equal:

sqrt[(x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2] = sqrt[(u + x)^2 + (v + y)^2]

Squaring both sides:

(x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2 = (u + x)^2 + (v + y)^2

Expanding both sides:

Left side: x² - 2xu + u² + y² - 2yv + v²

Right side: u² + 2xu + x² + v² + 2yv + y²

Subtracting right side from left side:

(x² - 2xu + u² + y² - 2yv + v²) - (u² + 2xu + x² + v² + 2yv + y²) = 0

Simplify:

-4xu -4yv = 0

So, -4(xu + yv) = 0 => xu + yv = 0.

So, that's one condition: xu + yv = 0.

Additionally, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.

Let me verify: The diagonals are AC and BD. Diagonal AC goes from (x,y) to (-x,-y), so its slope is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x.

Similarly, diagonal BD goes from (u,v) to (-u,-v), so its slope is (-v - v)/(-u - u) = (-2v)/(-2u) = v/u.

Since diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1.

So, (y/x) * (v/u) = -1.

So, (yv)/(xu) = -1 => yv = -xu.

But from the earlier condition, xu + yv = 0, which implies xu = -yv.

So, substituting that into our equation: (yv)/(xu) = (yv)/(-yv) = -1, which is correct. So, that's consistent.

Therefore, the condition xu + yv = 0 is the same as yv = -xu.

So, that's one equation.

Now, points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola. So, for point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Similarly, point B: u²/20 - v²/24 = 1.

So, we have two equations:

1) xu + yv = 0

2) x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

3) u²/20 - v²/24 = 1

Our goal is to find BD². Let's figure out BD.

Points B(u,v) and D(-u,-v). So, BD is the distance between (u,v) and (-u,-v). That's sqrt[(u - (-u))² + (v - (-v))²] = sqrt[(2u)² + (2v)²] = 2*sqrt(u² + v²).

Therefore, BD² is [2*sqrt(u² + v²)]² = 4(u² + v²).

So, BD² = 4(u² + v²). So, we need to find the minimum value of 4(u² + v²), given the constraints.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, if BD² can be made arbitrarily small, then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be negative infinity, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps BD² has a lower bound, and we need to find that.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the minimum BD², so the answer would be that minimum.

Wait, maybe I should consider that BD² can't be smaller than a certain value based on the hyperbola's properties.

But let me think through step by step.

We have two points A(x,y) and B(u,v) on the hyperbola. So, both satisfy the hyperbola equation.

Additionally, we have xu + yv = 0.

So, that's our main constraint.

We can think of this as a system of equations:

1) x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

2) u²/20 - v²/24 = 1

3) xu + yv = 0

We can try to solve this system to find u and v in terms of x and y, or vice versa, and then express BD² in terms of x and y, and then find its minimum.

Alternatively, we can parameterize points on the hyperbola.

Hmm, hyperbola parametrization. For hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, a standard parametrization is (a secθ, b tanθ). But another parametrization is (a cosh t, b sinh t), which covers only one branch. Alternatively, since the hyperbola has two branches, maybe we can parametrize points on both branches.

Wait, in our case, points A and C are on one branch, since they are symmetric with respect to the origin. Similarly, points B and D are on the other branch? Wait, no, because if A is (x,y), then C is (-x,-y). Depending on the hyperbola's equation, substituting x with -x and y with -y doesn't change the equation, so if A is on the hyperbola, so is C. Similarly for B and D.

Wait, but for the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, points can be on either the right or left branch. So, for A = (x,y), when x is positive, it's on the right branch; when x is negative, on the left.

But in a rhombus, we have four points. So, is it possible that two points are on one branch and two on the other? Or all four on one branch?

Wait, but the hyperbola equation is symmetric with respect to both axes and the origin. So, points can be arranged symmetrically on either side.

But in our case, since diagonals intersect at the origin, and points A and C are opposite each other, as are B and D.

So, for example, if A is on the right branch, then C is on the left branch. Similarly, B and D would be on the left and right branches as well.

Wait, no. If A is on the right branch, then C is (-x, -y), which if A is (x,y) on the right branch, then C is (-x, -y), which is on the left branch. Similarly, for B(u,v), if u is positive, then D is (-u,-v), which is on the left branch. So, points A and C are on opposite branches, as are points B and D.

Therefore, the rhombus has two points on the right branch and two on the left.

But wait, actually, the hyperbola is symmetric, so how would the rhombus look? Let me think of plotting points.

But perhaps instead of getting bogged down here, I should proceed with the equations.

We have xu + yv = 0.

We can write this as v = (-xu)/y.

So, if we can express v in terms of u, x, y, we can substitute into the hyperbola equation for point B.

So, from equation 2: u²/20 - v²/24 = 1.

Substitute v = (-xu)/y:

u²/20 - [ (x² u²)/(y²) ] / 24 = 1.

Simplify:

u²/20 - (x² u²)/(24 y²) = 1.

Factor out u²:

u² [ 1/20 - x²/(24 y²) ] = 1.

So, u² = 1 / [ 1/20 - x²/(24 y²) ].

Hmm, so the expression inside the brackets must be non-zero, and we can solve for u².

But let's see if we can find a relation between x and y.

From equation 1: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

So, we can write x² = 20(1 + y²/24) = 20 + (20 y²)/24 = 20 + (5 y²)/6.

So, x² = 20 + (5 y²)/6.

So, substituting back into the expression for u²:

u² = 1 / [ 1/20 - (20 + (5 y²)/6 ) / (24 y²) ) ].

Wait, let's compute the denominator: 1/20 - [ (20 + (5 y²)/6 ) / (24 y²) ].

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute x²/(24 y²):

x²/(24 y²) = [20 + (5 y²)/6 ] / (24 y²) = [20/(24 y²)] + [ (5 y²)/(6 * 24 y²) ].

Simplify each term:

20/(24 y²) = (5)/(6 y²).

(5 y²)/(144 y²) = 5/144.

So, x²/(24 y²) = 5/(6 y²) + 5/144.

So, 1/20 - x²/(24 y²) = 1/20 - [5/(6 y²) + 5/144].

So, let's compute this:

1/20 - 5/(6 y²) - 5/144.

Hmm, to combine these, I can find a common denominator, which would be 720 y².

Wait, maybe it's better to write each term with denominator 720 y².

1/20 = 36 y² / (720 y²).

5/(6 y²) = (600) / (720 y²).

5/144 = (25 y²) / (720 y²).

Wait, perhaps that's not the best approach. Alternatively, maybe express all terms with denominator 720.

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too messy. Maybe I should represent everything in terms of y².

Wait, let me reorganize:

Denominator D = 1/20 - [5/(6 y²) + 5/144].

So, D = (1/20) - 5/(6 y²) - 5/144.

Let me write all terms with denominator 720 y².

1/20 = 36 y² / (720 y²).

5/(6 y²) = (600) / (720 y²) → Wait, 5/(6 y²) = (5 * 120) / (720 y²) = 600/(720 y²).

Similarly, 5/144 = (25 y²)/ (720 y²) → Wait, 5/144 = (5 * 5 y²) / (720 y²) → Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, 5/144 = (5 * 5 y²)??? Wait, no, 5/144 is a pure number, so when I express it over 720 y², it would be (5 * 5 y²)/ (720 y²) ? No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps a better approach. Let me compute D:

D = 1/20 - 5/(6 y²) - 5/144.

Let me compute 1/20 - 5/144 first.

Convert 1/20 and 5/144 to a common denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 144 is 720.

1/20 = 36/720.

5/144 = 25/720.

So, 1/20 - 5/144 = (36 -25)/720 = 11/720.

So, D = 11/720 - 5/(6 y²).

So, D = (11/720) - (5/(6 y²)).

So, denominator D = (11/720 - 5/(6 y²)).

So, u² = 1 / [ (11/720) - (5/(6 y²)) ].

Hmm, so u² is expressed in terms of y².

So, now, BD² is 4(u² + v²). But from earlier, v = (-xu)/y.

So, v = (-xu)/y.

So, v² = (x² u²)/y².

So, BD² = 4(u² + (x² u²)/y²) = 4 u² (1 + x²/y²).

So, BD² = 4 u² (1 + x²/y²).

But x² is given in terms of y² from the hyperbola equation: x² = 20 + (5 y²)/6.

So, x²/y² = [20 + (5 y²)/6 ] / y² = 20/y² + 5/6.

So, BD² = 4 u² (1 + 20/y² + 5/6).

Simplify 1 + 5/6 = 11/6, so:

BD² = 4 u² (11/6 + 20/y²).

But from earlier, u² = 1 / [ (11/720) - (5/(6 y²)) ].

So, let me substitute that in:

BD² = 4 * [ 1 / (11/720 - 5/(6 y²)) ] * (11/6 + 20/y²).

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can simplify this expression.

Let me define t = y². So, t is positive because y is real.

So, then, BD² becomes:

4 * [ 1 / (11/720 - 5/(6 t)) ] * (11/6 + 20/t )

So, let me write this as:

BD² = 4 * [ 1 / ( (11/720) - (5)/(6 t) ) ] * [ (11/6) + (20)/t ]

Simplify the denominators:

First, let me compute the denominator of the first term:

11/720 - 5/(6 t) = (11 t - 5 * 720/(6 t)) / (720 t). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, perhaps better to write both terms over a common denominator.

So, 11/720 - 5/(6 t) = (11 t - 5 * 720/(6 t)) / (720 t). Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, write both terms over 720 t.

11/720 = (11 t) / (720 t).

5/(6 t) = (5 * 120 ) / (720 t) = 600 / (720 t).

So,

11/720 - 5/(6 t) = (11 t - 600) / (720 t).

Similarly, the numerator of the second term is:

11/6 + 20/t = (11 t + 120 * 6) / (6 t) ??? Wait, let me compute it over a common denominator.

Wait, 11/6 + 20/t = (11 t + 120)/ (6 t).

So, now, BD² becomes:

4 * [ 1 / ( (11 t - 600) / (720 t) ) ] * [ (11 t + 120 ) / (6 t) )

Simplify:

1 divided by ( (11 t - 600)/(720 t) ) is equal to (720 t)/(11 t - 600).

So,

BD² = 4 * (720 t)/(11 t - 600) * (11 t + 120)/(6 t )

Simplify the terms:

First, 4 * (720 t) = 4 * 720 t = 2880 t.

Denominator: (11 t - 600).

Multiply by (11 t + 120)/(6 t):

So,

BD² = (2880 t) / (11 t - 600) * (11 t + 120)/(6 t )

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2880 t * (11 t + 120 ) = 2880 t * (11 t + 120 )

Denominator: (11 t - 600) * 6 t = 6 t (11 t - 600 )

So, BD² = [2880 t (11 t + 120 ) ] / [6 t (11 t - 600 ) ]

Simplify:

2880 /6 = 480.

t cancels out.

So, BD² = 480 (11 t + 120 ) / (11 t - 600 )

So, BD² = 480 (11 t + 120 ) / (11 t - 600 )

But for this expression to make sense, denominator 11 t - 600 must not be zero. Also, since we have points on the hyperbola, the denominator must be positive? Because t is positive.

Wait, let's see. Let me think about the domain.

From u² = 1 / [ (11/720) - 5/(6 t) ]

Since u² must be positive, the denominator must be positive.

So, (11/720) - 5/(6 t) > 0.

So, 11/720 > 5/(6 t )

Multiply both sides by 720 t (positive, since t is positive):

11 t > 5 * 120 => 11 t > 600 => t > 600/11 ≈ 54.545.

So, t must be greater than 600/11.

So, t > 600/11.

So, 11 t - 600 > 0, because 11 t > 600, so denominator is positive. So, BD² is positive.

So, now, BD² = 480 (11 t + 120 ) / (11 t - 600 )

We can factor numerator and denominator:

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 11 t + 120 = 11 t + 120.

Denominator: 11 t - 600.

So, let me write BD² as:

BD² = 480 * [ (11 t + 120) / (11 t - 600) ]

Hmm, perhaps we can write this as:

Let me set s = 11 t.

Since t > 600/11, s > 600.

So, BD² becomes:

480 * [ (s + 120 ) / (s - 600) ]

So, BD² = 480 * [ (s + 120 ) / (s - 600) ]

I can express this as:

480 * [ (s - 600 + 720 ) / (s - 600) ] = 480 [ 1 + 720/(s - 600) ]

So, BD² = 480 [ 1 + 720/(s - 600) ]

Since s > 600, s - 600 is positive, so 720/(s - 600) is positive.

Therefore, BD² can be written as 480 + 480 * 720 / (s - 600 )

Because 480*(1 + a) = 480 + 480a.

So, BD² = 480 + (480 * 720)/(s - 600 )

Now, s =11 t, and t > 600/11 ≈54.545, so s > 600.

Therefore, s - 600 is positive, and as s increases, the term (s - 600) increases, so 720/(s - 600) decreases, approaching zero as s approaches infinity.

Similarly, as s approaches 600 from above, (s - 600) approaches zero, so 720/(s - 600) approaches infinity.

Therefore, BD² can be made arbitrarily large by taking s close to 600, but can it be made arbitrarily small?

Wait, looking at BD² = 480 + (480 * 720)/(s - 600 )

As s approaches infinity, the second term approaches zero, so BD² approaches 480.

As s approaches 600 from above, the second term approaches infinity, so BD² approaches infinity.

So, the minimal value of BD² is 480, approached as s becomes very large, i.e., t becomes very large.

But wait, can s actually be made arbitrarily large?

Because s = 11 t, and t = y², so as y² becomes large, t becomes large, so s becomes large.

Is there any constraint on t beyond t > 600/11?

Well, from the hyperbola equation, any real number t > 0 is allowed as long as x² = 20 + (5 t)/6 is positive, which it is for any t.

Wait, but let me check if when t approaches infinity, what happens to the points.

As t approaches infinity, y² approaches infinity, so y approaches infinity or negative infinity.

From x² =20 + (5 t)/6, as t approaches infinity, x² approaches infinity, so x approaches positive or negative infinity.

So, points A(x,y) would be at infinity, as would points B(u,v).

But in the context of the problem, we're considering all possible rhombi, so including those where points go to infinity. So, in the limit, BD² approaches 480.

Therefore, the minimal value of BD² is 480.

But wait, is 480 achievable? Or is it just a limit?

Because as s approaches infinity, BD² approaches 480. So, 480 is the infimum. So, the minimal BD² is 480, but it's not achieved for any finite rhombus; it's just approached as the rhombus becomes very large.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480, since BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 480 from above, but never less than 480.

Wait, no. Wait, as s increases, BD² decreases towards 480. So, BD² can be made as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480.

Wait, no. Let me think: from the expression BD² = 480 + C/(s - 600), where C is a positive constant.

As s approaches infinity, BD² approaches 480.

As s approaches 600 from above, BD² approaches infinity.

So, the minimal BD² is 480, but it's not attained. So, for all rhombi, BD² is greater than 480. So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

Therefore, the answer is 480.

Wait, but I should make sure that BD² can't be smaller than 480. Since in the limit, it approaches 480, so for any epsilon >0, there exists a rhombus with BD² < 480 + epsilon. So, the infimum is 480, which is the greatest lower bound.

So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.

So, the answer is 480.

But wait, wait a second. Let me verify my steps because I think I might have made a miscalculation when expressing BD².

Let me go back to BD² expression:

Earlier, I had BD² = 480 (11 t + 120 ) / (11 t - 600 )

But when I set s = 11 t, so BD² becomes 480*(s + 120)/(s - 600).

Then, I rewrote this as 480*( (s - 600) + 720 )/(s - 600) ) = 480*(1 + 720/(s - 600)).

Which is correct.

Then, BD² = 480 + (480 * 720)/(s - 600 )

So, as s approaches infinity, the second term approaches zero, so BD² approaches 480.

So, that's correct.

Therefore, the minimal BD² is 480, so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

So, the final answer is 480.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{480}


--- Final Answer Content ---


Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombi \(ABCD\) whose diagonals intersect at the origin.

1. The hyperbola is centered at the origin and opens along the x-axis.
2. Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on the hyperbola and form a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin.
3. The diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular and bisect each other at the origin.
4. Points \(A\) and \(C\) are symmetric with respect to the origin, as are points \(B\) and \(D\).
5. The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at the origin, and their slopes are perpendicular.

Using the hyperbola equation and the conditions for the rhombus:
- Points \(A(x, y)\) and \(B(u, v)\) satisfy \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) and \(\frac{u^2}{20} - \frac{v^2}{24} = 1\).
- The condition \(xu + yv = 0\) must be satisfied.

We express \(BD^2\) in terms of \(u\) and \(v\):
- \(BD^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2)\).

Using parameterization and simplification:
- Express \(u^2\) and \(v^2\) in terms of \(x\), \(y\), and solve for \(BD^2\).
- Through algebraic manipulation and substitution, we find that \(BD^2\) can be expressed in terms of a parameter \(t = y^2\).

After simplification, we find:
- \(BD^2 = 480 + \frac{480 \times 720}{s - 600}\) where \(s = 11t\).
- As \(s\) approaches infinity, \(BD^2\) approaches 480.

Thus, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is 480.

\[
\boxed{480}
\]
