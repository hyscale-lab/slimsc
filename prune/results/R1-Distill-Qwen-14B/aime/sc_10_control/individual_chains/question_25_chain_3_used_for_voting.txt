Alright, so I've got this math problem here about the residents of Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to parse it out step by step.

First, the problem says there are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's a given for everyone. Then, there are some other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195 owning a diamond ring, 367 owning golf clubs, and 562 owning a garden spade. 

Additionally, the problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We need to find how many own all four—so that's the candy hearts plus the other three.

Wait, hold on. Every resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, candy hearts are like a universal set here. So, when it talks about owning diamond rings, golf clubs, or garden spades, those are in addition to the candy hearts. So, when we're considering people who own two or three things, those are in addition to the candy hearts. Or is it including? Hmm, the wording says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, every resident has at least that. So, when it says someone owns exactly two things, that would be the candy hearts plus one other item, right? Because they have to own the candy hearts. Or wait, is that the case?

Wait, let me think again. The way it's phrased: "there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things." The "these things" probably refers to the other three items—diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade. Because the candy hearts are already given to everyone. So, maybe the 437 is the number of people who own exactly two of the three non-candy items. Similarly, 234 own exactly three of them. So, the candy hearts are separate. So, each person has 1 (candy hearts) plus some combination of the other three.

Alternatively, perhaps the "these things" includes the candy hearts. Hmm. That could complicate things. Let me read the problem again.

"The last line of your response should be your integer answer within \boxed{}.

Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things."

So, the way it's structured: the residents own some combination of four things—diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. But the candy hearts are owned by everyone. So, when it says 437 own exactly two of these things, that would include the candy hearts. So, a person could own two things: maybe a diamond ring and candy hearts, but not the others. Similarly, someone could own all four, which would include the candy hearts.

So, the 'these things' refers to all four items. Because the problem says, "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts," so candy hearts are part of the 'these things.' Therefore, when it says 437 own exactly two of these things, that includes the candy hearts. So, a person could have, say, a garden spade and candy hearts, but nothing else, and that would count as two things.

Hmm, that changes my initial thought. So, the problem is about four sets: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), garden spades (S), and candy hearts (C), which is owned by everyone. So, everyone is in C. So, the total number of residents is 900, which is the size of C.

We have the sizes of D, G, S: |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562. We also know that 437 own exactly two of these four things, and 234 own exactly three. So, we need to find |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|, which is the number of people owning all four things. But since C is universal, this is the same as |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Wait, but if C is universal, then any intersection would automatically include C. So, for instance, D ∩ G ∩ S would already include C, so |D ∩ G ∩ S| is the number of people owning D, G, S, and C. So, that's our target.

So, to recap, we have four sets, with C being universal. So, the total number of people is the sum over all possible combinations, considering overlaps. But since C is universal, perhaps we can model this using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Wait, I think a better approach is to model this using the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets, but since C is a universal set, it's included in all the other intersections. Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of the Venn diagram with four circles, but since every person is in C, the Venn diagram would be a bit different.

But perhaps it's easier to model the problem as considering the four items: D, G, S, and C. Since everyone is in C, C is the universal set. So, the problem becomes about the other three sets: D, G, S.

Wait, but the counts for exactly two and exactly three would include C as one of the items. Hmm, that complicates things. Because when someone owns exactly two of the four things, one of those could be C. So, for example, someone could own C and D, but nothing else. That would be two things. Similarly, someone could own C, D, and G—three things.

But the problem states that 437 own exactly two of these things, which includes C, and 234 own exactly three.

So, perhaps I should model it as four sets, but with C being the universal set.

Alternatively, since all own C, maybe we can subtract C from all the other sets and think in terms of D', G', S' where D' is D minus C, etc. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, since C is universal, maybe we can think in terms of the other three sets only.

Wait, maybe that's the way to go. Let me consider that the four things are D, G, S, C, but since C is owned by everyone, perhaps the problem is equivalent to considering the other three sets (D, G, S) with each resident possibly owning 0, 1, 2, 3, or all four (which would be owning D, G, S, and C).

But since C is always present, the number of residents owning exactly two things would be the number of residents owning C + exactly one of D, G, S. Because if someone owns exactly two things, one is C, and the other is one of D, G, S. Similarly, someone who owns exactly three things would have C plus two of D, G, S. And someone who owns all four would have all three plus C.

Wait, no. Let's think:

Wait, no. Because the four things are D, G, S, and C. So, if a person owns exactly two of these things, it could be:

- C and D
- C and G
- C and S
- D and G
- D and S
- G and S

So, six possible pairs. So, the 437 residents owning exactly two of the four things include those who own C plus one of the others, as well as those who own two of D, G, S and not C.

Wait, but that can't be, because if someone owns two of D, G, S, they must also own C, since everyone owns C. So, actually, no one can own exactly two of D, G, S without C. Because they have to own C. So, in that case, the 437 people who own exactly two of the four things must be the ones who own C plus exactly one of D, G, S. Because if they owned two of D, G, S, they would have three things (C plus two), which would count as owning exactly three things.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the 437 exactly two-owners are the ones who have C and exactly one of D, G, S. Similarly, the 234 exactly three-owners have C and exactly two of D, G, S. And the people who have all four would be the ones with C and all three of D, G, S.

So, that's a key insight. So, to model this, let me define:

- Let a be the number of people who own exactly C and D (i.e., only two things: C and D)
- Let b be the number of people who own exactly C and G
- Let c be the number of people who own exactly C and S
- Let d be the number of people who own exactly C, D, and G (i.e., three things)
- Let e be the number of people who own exactly C, D, and S
- Let f be the number of people who own exactly C, G, and S
- Let g be the number of people who own all four: C, D, G, S.

So, the total number of people is 900, which is the sum of all these categories plus those who own none of D, G, S, but only C. Wait, no, because everyone owns C, so the only way someone doesn't own any of D, G, S is if they just own C. Let me define h as the number of people who own only C.

So, our variables are a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h.

But wait, that complicates it. Maybe a better approach is to think in terms of the number of people owning exactly one, two, three, or four of the four things.

Wait, but the problem says 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. So, the rest must own one or four.

But wait, no. Because the total number of residents is 900. So, the sum of all these categories is 900.

So, let me structure it:

Total = (number with only C) + (number with exactly two things) + (number with exactly three things) + (number with all four) + (number with exactly one thing).

Wait, but the problem only gives us the numbers for exactly two and exactly three. So, we don't know the number with exactly one or all four. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps we can model the counts using the inclusion-exclusion principle.

But maybe I should think about the counts of D, G, and S.

We have |D| = 195, |G|=367, |S|=562. And the total number of people is 900.

But since C is universal, the counts of D, G, S are subsets of C.

Wait, but perhaps using the inclusion-exclusion for the three sets D, G, S, and considering that the total number of people who own at least one of D, G, S is 900 minus the number of people who own only C.

But since the problem doesn't give the number of people who own only C, perhaps we can proceed differently.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the counts of D, G, S in terms of how many people have each, considering overlaps.

But let's think about the counts:

The sum of the individual counts is |D| + |G| + |S| = 195 + 367 + 562 = let's calculate that.

195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124. So, sum is 1124.

But the total number of residents is 900. So, the sum of the individual counts (1124) is greater than 900, which indicates a lot of overlaps.

Using inclusion-exclusion for three sets, the formula is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|.

But since the universal set is C (since everyone owns C), so |D ∪ G ∪ S| is equal to the number of people who own at least one of D, G, S, which is equal to 900 minus the number of people who own only C. Let me denote h as the number of people owning only C, so |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - h.

But we don't know h yet. Hmm.

But perhaps we can relate h to the counts of exactly one, two, three, and four.

Wait, let me think in terms of the number of people in each category:

- Only C: h
- Exactly one of D, G, S: Let's denote this as x
- Exactly two of D, G, S: This is 437, as given
- Exactly three of D, G, S: 234, as given
- All four: g, which is what we're trying to find.

Wait, is that correct? Wait, the problem says 437 own exactly two of these things. Since C is included, exactly two could include C. So, for example, someone could own C and D, but not G or S. That would be two things. Similarly, someone could own C, D, G, but not S—three things, which is the next category.

Wait, but in our initial thought earlier, the 437 exactly two-owners would include people who own C and exactly one of D, G, S. Because if someone owns two among D, G, S, they would have three things (C plus two). So, I think the 437 exactly two-owners are the people who have exactly one of D, G, S plus C.

So, in that case, the number of people who own exactly two things (including C) is 437. Similarly, the 234 exactly three-owners are the people who have exactly two of D, G, S plus C.

So, the number of people who own exactly four things is the number of people who own all three of D, G, S plus C, which is g.

So, putting it all together:

Total = h (only C) + x (exactly one of D, G, S) + 437 (exactly two, which is C + one of D, G, S) + 234 (exactly three, which is C + two of D, G, S) + g (all four, which is C + all three).

So, h + x + 437 + 234 + g = 900.

But we don't know h, x, or g. So, that's three variables; perhaps we can find another equation.

Alternatively, we can model the counts of D, G, S in terms of these variables.

Let me think: |D| is the sum of the following:

- People who own only D and C (a)
- People who own D, C, and one other: d (D, G, C) and e (D, S, C)
- People who own D, C, and two others: g (all four)
So, |D| = a + d + e + g.

Similarly, |G| = b + d + f + g.

And |S| = c + e + f + g.

So, we can write:

195 = a + d + e + g
367 = b + d + f + g
562 = c + e + f + g.

Additionally, the number of people who own exactly two things is 437, which includes:

- a (C and D)
- b (C and G)
- c (C and S)
- The number of people who own exactly two of D, G, S. Wait, no. Because if someone owns two of D, G, S, they must also own C, so those would be the people in the three-way intersections but not all three. Wait, no. Wait, the people who own exactly two of D, G, S and C would be the ones who own exactly three things. So, the 437 exactly two-owners are only the ones who own exactly one of D, G, S plus C.

So, 437 = a + b + c.

Similarly, the number of people who own exactly three of D, G, S and C is 234. Which would be:

d + e + f = 234.

And the number of people who own all four is g.

So, now, let's write down the equations we have:

1. h + x + 437 + 234 + g = 900 → h + x + g = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.

2. |D| = a + d + e + g = 195
3. |G| = b + d + f + g = 367
4. |S| = c + e + f + g = 562
5. a + b + c = 437
6. d + e + f = 234

We also have h, x, and g as variables. But we need more equations.

Wait, perhaps we can find another relation. Let's consider the sum of |D| + |G| + |S|.

From above, |D| + |G| + |S| = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.

From equation 2, 3, 4:

Sum = (a + b + c) + 2*(d + e + f) + 3*g = 437 + 2*234 + 3g = 437 + 468 + 3g = 905 + 3g.

Wait, let's check:

Sum of |D| + |G| + |S| = (a + d + e + g) + (b + d + f + g) + (c + e + f + g) = a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3g.

Which can be written as (a + b + c) + 2*(d + e + f) + 3g.

We know that a + b + c =437, d + e + f=234.

So, substituting:

Sum = 437 + 2*234 + 3g = 437 + 468 + 3g = 905 +3g.

But this sum is 1124, as calculated earlier.

So, 905 +3g = 1124 → 3g=1124-905=219 → g=73.

So, the number of people who own all four things is 73.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check.

So, the sum of |D| + |G| + |S| is 1124. We used inclusion-exclusion to express this sum in terms of the given numbers and g. The result gave us g=73. So, the answer is 73.

Let me verify the calculations.

Sum of |D|+|G|+|S| = 195 + 367 + 562.

195 + 367 = 562, plus 562 is 1124. Correct.

Then, the sum in terms of variables is 437 + 2*234 +3g.

437 + 468 = 905. 905 +3g=1124.

1124-905=219. 219/3=73. So, g=73.

Looks correct.

So, the number of residents who own all four is 73.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining how many residents of Aimeville own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Since every resident owns the candy hearts, the problem reduces to analyzing ownership of the other three items. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given numbers, we calculate the number of residents who own all four items as follows:

1. Calculate the total ownership of the three items:  
   \( |D| + |G| + |S| = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124 \).

2. Express the total ownership in terms of overlaps:  
   \( |D| + |G| + |S| = (a + b + c) + 2(d + e + f) + 3g \),  
   where \( a + b + c = 437 \) and \( d + e + f = 234 \).

3. Substitute known values:  
   \( 1124 = 437 + 2(234) + 3g \).  
   \( 1124 = 437 + 468 + 3g \).  
   \( 1124 = 905 + 3g \).  
   \( 3g = 219 \).  
   \( g = 73 \).

Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is \(\boxed{73}\).
