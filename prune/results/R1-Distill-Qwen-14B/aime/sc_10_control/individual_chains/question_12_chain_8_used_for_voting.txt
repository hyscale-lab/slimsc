Okay, so I have this math problem here where I need to find the number of ways to place digits in a 2x3 grid. The conditions are that when you read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed should add up to 999, and when you read them top to bottom, the three numbers formed should add up to 99. Hmm, that's a bit tricky, but let me break it down.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2-row by 3-column grid. So each row has 3 cells, and each column has 2 cells. Let me denote the grid like this:

a b c
d e f

Where a, b, c are in the top row, and d, e, f are in the bottom row. So, the two numbers formed by reading left to right are "abc" and "def". These are three-digit numbers if each cell is a single digit. So, the sum of these two numbers should be 999.

Similarly, when we read top to bottom, we get "ad", "be", and "cf". These are two-digit numbers each, and their sum should be 99.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The problem says, "the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99." So, each column gives a two-digit number, and there are three such numbers. Their sum is 99.

So, the two numbers from the rows are:

Top row: a b c → number ABC = 100a + 10b + c

Bottom row: d e f → number DEF = 100d + 10e + f

And the sum of ABC + DEF = 999.

For the columns:

Each column has two digits, so top digit followed by bottom digit. So:

First column: a and d → number AD = 10a + d

Second column: b and e → number BE = 10b + e

Third column: c and f → number CF = 10c + f

And the sum AD + BE + CF = 99.

So, now I have two equations:

1) ABC + DEF = 999

Which expands to:

(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999

Simplify this:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999

Which can be written as:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999

And equation 2:

AD + BE + CF = 99

Which is:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

Simplify:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Grouping terms:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Hmm, so now I have two equations:

Equation 1: 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999

Equation 2: 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Also, remember that a, b, c, d, e, f are digits, meaning each can be from 0 to 9.

I need to find the number of possible assignments of digits a, b, c, d, e, f that satisfy both equations.

Let me denote some variables to simplify this.

Let me define:

S1 = a + d

S2 = b + e

S3 = c + f

So equation 1 becomes:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999

Which can be broken down as:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999

So, 100*S1 is the hundreds place, 10*S2 is the tens, and S3 is the units.

Similarly, let's look at equation 2. Let me define:

T1 = a + b + c

T2 = d + e + f

Then equation 2 becomes:

10*T1 + T2 = 99

So, 10*T1 + T2 = 99.

Where T1 is the sum of the top row digits, and T2 is the sum of the bottom row digits.

Now, let's think about equation 2 first.

10*T1 + T2 = 99.

Since T1 and T2 are sums of digits:

Each of a, b, c is a digit (0-9), so T1 can range from 0 (if all are 0) to 27 (9+9+9).

Similarly, T2 can range from 0 to 27.

But 10*T1 + T2 = 99.

So, T1 and T2 must satisfy that equation.

Let's think about possible values of T1 and T2.

Since 10*T1 + T2 =99, and both T1 and T2 are integers ≥0.

So, let's solve for T2: T2 = 99 -10*T1.

Since T2 has to be ≥0 and ≤27, let's find possible T1.

So:

99 - 10*T1 ≥0 → T1 ≤9.9, so T1 ≤9.

And 99 - 10*T1 ≤27 → 99 -27 ≤10*T1 →72 ≤10*T1 →T1 ≥7.2, so T1 ≥8.

Because T1 is an integer, so T1 can be 8 or 9.

Let me check:

If T1=8, then T2=99-80=19.

If T1=9, then T2=99-90=9.

Wait, but T2 must be ≤27, which is true for both 19 and 9.

So, possible cases are:

Case 1: T1=8, T2=19.

Case 2: T1=9, T2=9.

So, for equation 2, these are the two possibilities.

Now, let's go back to equation 1.

Equation 1: 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Which can be written as:

100*S1 +10*S2 + S3 = 999.

But each of S1, S2, S3 is the sum of two digits. So, S1 = a + d, which can be from 0+0=0 to 9+9=18.

Similarly, S2 = b + e, 0 to 18.

S3 = c + f, 0 to 18.

So, 100*S1 +10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Looking at this, 100*S1 must contribute to the hundreds place.

So, since 100*S1 ≤999, S1 can be up to 9, because 100*10=1000>999.

So S1 can be from 0 to 9.

But wait, 999 is 999, so 100*S1 must be ≤999.

Thus, S1 can be 0,1,...,9.

But equation 1 is 100*S1 +10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Let me think about the possible values.

Let me denote the right-hand side as 999, which is 9*100 + 9*10 +9.

So, 100*S1 must contribute to the 900 part, but wait, 999 is 999, which is 9*100 + 9*10 +9.

So, 100*S1 = 900 → S1=9.

Because 100*9=900.

Then, the remaining is 10*S2 + S3 = 99.

Wait, because 999 -900=99.

So, 10*S2 + S3 =99.

But S2 and S3 are sums of two digits, so each can be up to 18.

So, 10*S2 + S3 =99.

That equation must hold.

So, S2 can be from 9 to 9, because 10*S2 must be ≤99.

Wait, 10*S2 can be up to 90, because S2 is ≤18, but 10*18=180, which is more than 99. Wait, no, 10*S2 + S3=99.

So, S2 can be from 9 down to what?

Wait, let's think.

10*S2 + S3 =99.

Since S3 is a sum of two digits, S3 ≤18.

So, 10*S2 ≤99 -0 → S2 ≤9.9, so S2 can be up to 9.

But also, 10*S2 ≥99 -18=81.

Because S3 ≥0, so 10*S2 ≥81 → S2 ≥8.1, so S2 ≥9.

Hence, S2 must be exactly 9.

So, S2=9.

Then, S3=99 -10*9=99-90=9.

So, S3=9.

So, from equation 1, S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

Thus, equation 1 tells us that:

a + d =9,

b + e=9,

c + f=9.

So, each pair in the columns adds up to 9.

Now, that's interesting.

So, in each column, the top digit plus the bottom digit equals 9.

So, for the first column, a + d =9,

Second column, b + e=9,

Third column, c + f=9.

So, each column sums to 9.

Now, looking back at equation 2, which has two cases:

Case 1: T1=8, T2=19.

Case 2: T1=9, T2=9.

Where T1 = a + b + c,

T2 = d + e + f.

But from equation 1, we have:

a + d =9,

b + e=9,

c + f=9.

So, T2 = d + e + f = (9 -a) + (9 - b) + (9 -c) = 27 - (a + b + c) =27 - T1.

So, T2=27 - T1.

But equation 2 says 10*T1 + T2=99.

Substituting T2=27 - T1:

10*T1 + (27 - T1) =99 → 9*T1 +27=99 →9*T1=72 → T1=8.

So, T1 must be 8, which gives T2=27-8=19.

So, that means Case 1 is the only possible case.

So, T1=8, T2=19.

Therefore, equation 2 only has one solution: T1=8, T2=19.

Because when we substituted T2=27-T1 into equation 2, it forced T1=8.

So, that means the initial assumption that T1 could be 9 is invalid because it would require T2=9, but then T2=27-T1=18, which would not satisfy equation 2.

Wait, no, let's check.

Wait, if T1=9, then T2=27-9=18.

Then equation 2: 10*T1 + T2= 10*9 +18= 90+18=108≠99.

So, that doesn't work. So, only T1=8, T2=19.

So, now, we know that:

a + d=9,

b + e=9,

c + f=9,

and a + b + c=8,

d + e + f=19.

So, since d=9 -a,

e=9 -b,

f=9 -c.

So, substituting into T2= d + e + f= (9 -a)+(9 -b)+(9 -c)=27 - (a + b +c)=27-8=19.

Which matches, so that's consistent.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of tuples (a, b, c, d, e, f) where:

a + d=9,

b + e=9,

c + f=9,

and a + b + c=8.

Since d=9 -a,

e=9 -b,

f=9 -c.

So, the variables a, b, c are digits (0-9), and they must satisfy a + b + c=8.

So, let's find the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8 where 0 ≤a, b, c ≤9.

Since 8 is less than 9, the upper limit doesn't restrict since a, b, c can be at most 8 each.

So, the number of solutions is C(8 +3 -1, 3 -1)=C(10,2)=45.

But wait, but a, b, c are digits, so their values are from 0 to 9. Since 8 is less than 9, all possible solutions where a, b, c are non-negative integers adding to 8 are valid. So, 45 possible solutions.

But wait, no. Wait, in this case, a, b, c are digits, so each can be 0-9, but since their sum is 8, each of them can be from 0 up to 8.

But 45 is the number of non-negative integer solutions without considering the digit constraints beyond their sum. But since 8 is less than 9, each digit can be at most 8, which is allowed since digits go up to 9.

So, yes, 45 solutions.

But wait, the question is about the number of ways to place digits in the grid. So, each solution (a, b, c) corresponds to a unique grid, with d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c.

So, the number of such grids is equal to the number of solutions (a, b, c) with a + b + c=8, where a, b, c are digits.

So, 45.

Wait a second. But in the example given:

Top row: 0 0 8 → sum is 0+0+8=8.

Which fits T1=8.

So, that works.

So, does that mean the answer is 45? But wait, let me think again.

Each of a, b, c is a digit, meaning 0-9, but in the grid, the first digit of a number can't be zero? Wait, wait, the grid is 2x3. However, the problem didn't specify that the numbers can't have leading zeros. So, for example, the number 008 is allowed as a three-digit number, which is essentially 8.

So, in this case, leading zeros are allowed. So, each cell can be 0-9 without any restrictions.

Therefore, the number of solutions is indeed the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, which is 45.

But wait, hold on. Let me consider if a, b, c are digits, but a and d are the first digits of the two numbers formed by the rows. So, ABC is a three-digit number, but if a=0, then ABC becomes a two-digit number or a one-digit number, depending on the other digits. But the problem statement says "the two numbers formed by reading left to right", without specifying that they must be three-digit numbers. So, perhaps leading zeros are allowed, and ABC can be a three-digit number with leading zeros, effectively being any number from 000 to 999.

Similarly, DEF can be from 000 to 999. So, in that case, the initial assumption holds, and leading zeros are allowed. So, a, b, c can be 0.

Therefore, the number of solutions is 45.

But wait, let me think about the example given. The top row is 0,0,8. So, ABC is 008, which is 8, and DEF is 991, which sums to 8 + 991 = 999. So, that's allowed. So, leading zeros are allowed in the numbers formed, but in the grid, each cell is a digit, so 0 is allowed anywhere.

Therefore, the number of possible grids is 45.

Wait, but is that the case? Let me recap.

We have a + b + c =8.

Each of a, b, c can be 0-9, but their sum is 8.

Number of non-negative integer solutions is C(8 +3 -1, 3 -1)= C(10, 2)=45.

So, 45 possible ways.

But wait, in the grid, each of a, b, c, d, e, f is a digit. So, each can be from 0-9, but with the constraints a + d=9, etc.

So, the only constraints are a + d=9, b + e=9, c + f=9, and a + b + c=8.

So, each of these is a digit, so for each of a, b, c, d, e, f, their values are determined once a, b, c are chosen, as d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c.

So, the only variables are a, b, c. Thus, the number of possible grids is equal to the number of possible (a, b, c) tuples where a + b + c=8, and each is a digit (0-9). Since 8 is less than 9, and each of a, b, c can be up to 8, which is allowed, so 45.

So, the answer should be 45.

Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, when a=9, d=0. But a cannot be 9 because a + b + c=8, and 9 would make the sum exceed 8. So, a, b, c can only be from 0 to 8, inclusive, because their sum is 8.

So, yes, each of a, b, c can be from 0 to 8, and the number of solutions is 45.

But wait, does each solution correspond to a unique grid?

Yes, because once a, b, c are chosen, d, e, f are uniquely determined.

So, each (a, b, c) gives a unique grid. So, the number is 45.

Wait, but in the example given, a=0, b=0, c=8.

So, d=9, e=9, f=1.

Which gives the grid:

0 0 8

9 9 1

Which satisfies the conditions.

So, that should be one of the 45 possibilities.

Therefore, the number of ways is 45.

Wait, but let me think if there's any other constraint I missed.

Another thing: digits d, e, f are determined by a, b, c. So, d=9 -a, which must be a digit, i.e., 0 ≤d ≤9. Since a is between 0 and 8, d=9 -a is between 1 and 9. So, d is a valid digit (1-9), same with e and f.

Wait, for example, if a=0, then d=9, which is allowed. If a=8, d=1, which is allowed.

Similarly, for b and e, c and f.

So, all d, e, f are digits, so no issues there.

So, I think my reasoning is correct, and the number is 45.

But wait, another thought: when a=9, d=0, but a can't be 9 because a + b + c=8, so a can't exceed 8.

So, a, b, c are from 0-8, and the number of solutions is 45.

Hence, the answer is 45.

The problem requires determining the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99.

Let the grid be:

```
a b c
d e f
```

### Key Equations:
1. **Sum of the two numbers (left to right):**
   \[
   (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
   \]
   Let \( S_1 = a + d \), \( S_2 = b + e \), \( S_3 = c + f \). Then:
   \[
   100S_1 + 10S_2 + S_3 = 999
   \]

2. **Sum of the three numbers (top to bottom):**
   \[
   (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
   \]
   Let \( T_1 = a + b + c \) and \( T_2 = d + e + f \). Then:
   \[
   10T_1 + T_2 = 99
   \]

### Solving the Equations:
From equation 1, \( 100S_1 + 10S_2 + S_3 = 999 \), we deduce:
- \( S_1 = 9 \) (since \( 100 \times 9 = 900 \), the hundreds place of 999).
- \( 10S_2 + S_3 = 99 \). Since \( S_2 \) and \( S_3 \) are sums of two digits, \( S_2 = 9 \) and \( S_3 = 9 \).

Thus:
\[
a + d = 9, \quad b + e = 9, \quad c + f = 9
\]

From equation 2, \( 10T_1 + T_2 = 99 \), and since \( T_2 = 27 - T_1 \) (from the column sums), substituting gives:
\[
10T_1 + (27 - T_1) = 99 \implies 9T_1 = 72 \implies T_1 = 8
\]
Thus:
\[
a + b + c = 8, \quad d + e + f = 19
\]

### Counting the Solutions:
Each column sum \( a + d = 9 \), \( b + e = 9 \), \( c + f = 9 \) is fixed. The number of solutions depends on \( a + b + c = 8 \), where \( a, b, c \) are digits (0-9). The number of non-negative integer solutions to \( a + b + c = 8 \) is:
\[
\binom{8 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{10}{2} = 45
\]

Thus, there are **45** valid ways to fill the grid.

\boxed{45}
