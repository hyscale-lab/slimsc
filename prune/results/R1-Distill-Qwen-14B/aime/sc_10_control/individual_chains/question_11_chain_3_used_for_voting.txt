Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that for any complex number \( z \), if \( |z| = r \), then \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{r^2} \). Since \( |z| = 4 \), \( r = 4 \), so \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \). That might come in handy later.

Let me denote \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). Since the modulus is 4, this parametrization makes sense because \( |z| = 4 \) automatically.

Substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression, let me compute each part:

First term: \( (75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \).

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4} e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

So the entire expression becomes:
\[ 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \]

Now, let me compute each term separately. Maybe I can express them in terms of cosine and sine to make it easier to find the real part.

First, let's compute \( 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \). Let's factor out the 4 first:
\( 4 \times 75 = 300 \)
\( 4 \times 117 = 468 \)
So, \( 4(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i \).

Similarly, \( 24 + 36i \) is as it is.

So the expression is:
\[ (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \]

Now, I can express \( e^{i\theta} \) as \( \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} \) as \( \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

Let me substitute these into the expression:

First term:
\( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
Let me multiply this out:
= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta
Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this becomes:
= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta

Combine like terms:
Real parts: 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta
Imaginary parts: (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i

Second term:
\( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)
Multiply this out:
= 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta
Again, \( i^2 = -1 \), so:
= 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta

Combine like terms:
Real parts: 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta
Imaginary parts: (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)i

Now, adding both terms together:

Real parts from first term: 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta
Real parts from second term: 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta
Total real part: (300\cos\theta + 24\cos\theta) + (-468\sin\theta + 36\sin\theta)
= 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta

Imaginary parts from first term: (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i
Imaginary parts from second term: (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)i
Total imaginary part: (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta -24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)i
= (276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta)i

But since we are only interested in the real part, we can focus on \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

So the real part of the expression is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

Our goal is to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to \( \theta \).

This is a function of \( \theta \), and we can find its maximum using calculus or by recognizing it as a sinusoidal function.

I recall that an expression of the form \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) can be rewritten as \( R\cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \) and \( \phi = \arctan\left(\frac{B}{A}\right) \) or something like that.

Wait, in our case, it's \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). So, \( A = 324 \), \( B = -432 \).

The maximum value of \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) is \( R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \).

So let me compute \( R \):

\( R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} \)

Compute each term:

324 squared: Let's calculate 324^2. 300^2 is 90,000, 24^2 is 576, and 2*300*24=14,400. So 324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 = 90,000 +14,400 +576= 105, 976.

Wait, 90,000 + 14,400 is 104,400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: Let me compute that. 400^2 is 160,000, 32^2 is 1,024, and 2*400*32=25,600. So 432^2 = (400 +32)^2= 400^2 + 2*400*32 +32^2= 160,000 +25,600 +1,024= 186,624.

So R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

What's sqrt(291,600)? Let's see, 500^2 is 250,000, 540^2 is 291,600 because 54^2 is 2,916, so 540^2 is 291,600. So R = 540.

Therefore, the maximum value of the real part is 540.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, the maximum real part is 540.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check the steps.

1. Express \( z \) as \( 4e^{i\theta} \) is correct because \( |z|=4 \).

2. Calculated each term correctly by expanding the products. Yes, I think that was done correctly.

3. Combined the real parts and the imaginary parts correctly. Yes, seems okay.

4. Recognized that the real part is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \), which is a linear combination of sine and cosine, so its maximum is the amplitude, which is sqrt(324² + 432²). But wait, the coefficients are 324 and -432, so B is negative. But since we square them, the sign doesn't matter. So R is indeed sqrt(324² +432²)=540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

But wait a second, just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe using vectors or inner products.

The expression \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) can be thought of as the dot product of two vectors: \( [A, B] \) and \( [\cos\theta, \sin\theta] \). The maximum value occurs when the two vectors are in the same direction, so the maximum is the magnitude of the vector \( [A, B] \), which is sqrt(A² + B²). So yes, that's 540.

Alternatively, using calculus, take the derivative of the real part with respect to theta, set it to zero, and find the maximum.

Let me try that approach to verify.

Let me denote \( f(\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

Compute derivative \( f'(\theta) = -324\sin\theta -432\cos\theta \).

Set derivative to zero:

-324 sinθ -432 cosθ =0

=> 324 sinθ + 432 cosθ =0

Divide both sides by 108:

3 sinθ + 4 cosθ =0

=> 3 sinθ = -4 cosθ

Divide both sides by cosθ (assuming cosθ ≠0):

3 tanθ = -4

=> tanθ = -4/3

So θ = arctan(-4/3). Since tangent is periodic with period pi, the solutions will be θ = arctan(-4/3) + k pi.

But to find the maximum, we can plug this back into f(theta). Alternatively, since we've already found R=540, this should correspond to the maximum.

Alternatively, we can compute f(theta) at theta where tan theta = -4/3.

Let me compute cos(theta) and sin(theta).

If tan(theta) = -4/3, then we can imagine a right triangle where the opposite side is -4 and adjacent is 3, so hypotenuse is sqrt(3² + (-4)^2) = 5.

But since tan(theta) is negative, theta is in either the second or fourth quadrant.

But since in the expression 3 sin theta +4 cos theta=0, when tan theta = -4/3, let's see:

If tan theta = -4/3, then sin theta = -4/5 and cos theta = 3/5 if theta is in the fourth quadrant, or sin theta =4/5 and cos theta= -3/5 if theta is in the second quadrant.

Wait, let me think. If tan theta = -4/3, then the reference angle is arctan(4/3). So in the fourth quadrant, sin is negative, cos positive.

In the second quadrant, sin positive, cos negative.

But let's compute f(theta) at both possibilities.

Case 1: theta in fourth quadrant: cos(theta) = 3/5, sin(theta) = -4/5.

f(theta) = 324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = (972 +1728)/5 = 2700/5 = 540.

Case 2: theta in second quadrant: cos(theta) = -3/5, sin(theta) = 4/5.

f(theta) = 324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5) = (-972/5) - (1728/5) = (-2700)/5= -540.

So the maximum value is indeed 540, and the minimum is -540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.
