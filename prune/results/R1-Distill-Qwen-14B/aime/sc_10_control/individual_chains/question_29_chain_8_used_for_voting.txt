Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. I need to find the length of CE.

Given lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. Hmm, okay.

First, let me try to visualize this. There are two rectangles. Let me draw rectangle ABCD. Let's say AB is the base, so AB = 107 units. BC is 16 units, so the height of the rectangle is 16. So, ABCD would be a rectangle with length 107 and width 16. Then, there's another rectangle EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. That probably means that E is somewhere on the line DC or CF or something.

Wait, actually, the way it's written, D, E, C, F are collinear. So the order is D, then E, then C, then F. So the line goes D-E-C-F.

So, if I have rectangle ABCD, with AB=107, BC=16. Let me label the points. Let's say A is at the origin (0,0), so B would be at (107, 0). Then, since BC is 16, point C would be at (107, 16), and D would be at (0,16). Wait, but that would make ABCD a rectangle. Now, rectangle EFGH. I need to figure out where E, F, G, H are.

Wait, but since D, E, C, F are collinear, and D is at (0,16), C is at (107,16). So the line DC is the top side of rectangle ABCD. So E and F are on this line, with E between D and C, and F beyond C? Or perhaps E is on DC extended? Hmm, but the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, so E and F are on the line DC, but it doesn't specify if E is between D and C or outside.

Wait, but since E is part of rectangle EFGH, maybe E is somewhere else. Hmm, maybe I should consider the coordinates.

Let me try to assign coordinates to all points. Let me fix rectangle ABCD as I did before: A(0,0), B(107,0), C(107,16), D(0,16).

Now, EFGH is another rectangle. So, E is connected to F, F to G, G to H, and H to E. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, and ABCD has DC from (0,16) to (107,16), so the line DC is y=16.

So, E and F must be on the line y=16. Let me assume E and F are on DC, so their coordinates would be (x,16). But wait, D is at (0,16) and C is at (107,16), so E and F must lie on this line.

But the rectangles EFGH and ABCD. Let me think: if E is a point on DC, then EFGH is another rectangle. So, E is connected to F, and F is connected to G. So, if E is on DC, then F must be as well, but since F is part of EFGH, which is a rectangle, G must be somewhere else.

Wait, but the problem says A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, points A(0,0), D(0,16), H, G are on a circle. So, if I can find the circle passing through A, D, H, G, maybe that will help me find the coordinates of H and G, which in turn will give me more information about EFGH.

So, let me think about rectangle EFGH. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are 90 degrees. So, EF is one side, FG is another. Given that EF=184 and FG=17. So, EF is the length, FG is the width.

Wait, but in rectangle EFGH, EF is one side, FG is another. Let me see: E-F-G-H-E. So, EF is the side from E to F, then FG is from F to G, etc. So, if EF is 184 and FG is 17, then EFGH is a rectangle with length 184 and width 17.

But wait, E and F are on the line y=16. So, if E is at (e,16) and F is at (f,16), then the distance between E and F is |f - e| = 184. Because they're on the same horizontal line.

Wait, but wait, EF is 184. So, the length of EF is 184. Since it's a horizontal line, yes, |f - e| = 184.

Similarly, FG is 17, which would be the vertical distance from F to G. But since FG is a side of the rectangle, and in a rectangle, the sides are perpendicular. So, if EF is horizontal, FG must be vertical.

Wait, but if E and F are on the line y=16, then FG goes from F upwards or downwards. But since EFGH is a rectangle, if F is at (f,16), then G would be at (f,16 + 17) or (f,16 -17). Hmm.

But H is a point of the rectangle. So, if I have E at (e,16), F at (f,16), G at (f, 16+17) = (f,33), then H would be at (e,33). Alternatively, if G is at (f,16-17) = (f,-1), then H would be at (e,-1). But let's see.

Wait, but point H is part of the circle that goes through A, D, H, G. So, A is at (0,0), D is at (0,16), and H and G are somewhere else on that circle.

So, if G is at (f,33), then H would be at (e,33). Or if G is at (f,-1), H would be at (e,-1). Let me consider both possibilities.

But let's see, if G is at (f,33), then H is at (e,33). Alternatively, if G is at (f,-1), H is at (e,-1). Let's consider both cases.

First case: G is (f,33), H is (e,33).

Then, points A(0,0), D(0,16), G(f,33), H(e,33) lie on a circle. Let's find the equation of the circle passing through these four points.

Wait, but four points can define a circle only if they are concyclic. So, this condition must hold.

Alternatively, since A, D, G, H are concyclic, the quadrilateral ADGH is cyclic.

Let me think about the coordinates.

Points: A(0,0), D(0,16), G(f,33), H(e,33).

I can plug these into the general circle equation: x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0.

But since A is on the circle: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 → c=0.

So, equation becomes x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy = 0.

Now, plug in D(0,16):

0 + (16)^2 + 0 + 2f*(16) = 0 → 256 + 32f = 0 → 32f = -256 → f = -8.

So, equation is x² + y² + 2gx -16y = 0.

Now, plug in G(f,33):

f² + (33)^2 + 2g*f - 16*33 = 0.

Similarly, plug in H(e,33):

e² + (33)^2 + 2g*e - 16*33 = 0.

So, we have two equations:

1) f² + 1089 + 2g*f - 528 = 0 → f² + 2g f + 561 = 0.

2) e² + 1089 + 2g e -528 = 0 → e² + 2g e + 561 = 0.

Hmm, interesting. So, both equations have the same constants. So, equation 1: f² + 2g f + 561 = 0.

Equation 2: e² + 2g e + 561 = 0.

So, both f and e satisfy the same quadratic equation: x² + 2g x + 561 = 0.

Which suggests that e and f are roots of this quadratic equation.

But wait, let's think about this. e and f are two points on the line y=16, separated by 184 units. So, |f - e| = 184.

But if e and f are roots of the same quadratic equation, then from quadratic theory, we know that:

e + f = -2g,

and

e * f = 561.

So, we have e + f = -2g,

and e * f = 561.

We also know that |f - e| = 184.

So, let me write:

(f - e)^2 = (184)^2 = 33856.

But (f - e)^2 = (f + e)^2 - 4ef.

From equations above, (f + e)^2 = ( -2g )^2 = 4g²,

and 4ef = 4*561 = 2244.

So,

(f - e)^2 = 4g² - 2244 = 33856.

So,

4g² = 33856 + 2244 = 36100.

Thus,

g² = 36100 / 4 = 9025.

So,

g = sqrt(9025) = 95, or g = -95.

Wait, because square of 95 is 9025.

So, g = 95 or g = -95.

So, if g = 95,

then e + f = -2*95 = -190.

And e*f = 561.

So, the roots of the quadratic equation x² + 2g x + 561 = x² + 190x + 561 = 0.

Wait, let's check the discriminant:

D = (190)^2 - 4*1*561 = 36100 - 2244 = 33856.

Which is a perfect square, as 184^2=33856.

So, the roots are:

x = [-190 ± sqrt(33856)] / 2 = [-190 ± 184]/2.

So,

x = (-190 + 184)/2 = (-6)/2 = -3,

and x = (-190 -184)/2 = (-374)/2 = -187.

So, e and f are -3 and -187.

Wait, but EF is 184. So, if e and f are -3 and -187, the distance between them is | (-3) - (-187) | = |184| = 184. So, yes, that fits.

But wait, in rectangle ABCD, point D is at (0,16), and E is on the line DC. DC is from (0,16) to (107,16). So, E must lie on this line somewhere. But if E is at (-3,16), that's to the left of D, which is at (0,16). Similarly, F is at (-187,16), which is way to the left.

But that would make E and F not between D and C, but way to the left. Hmm. But the problem statement says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, perhaps E is to the left of D, and F is to the right of C? Or maybe both E and F are to the left? Wait, but E and F are on the same line, which is DC. So, if E is at (-3,16) and F is at (-187,16), then the line would be DC extended to the left, and E and F are on that extended line. But that would place E at (-3,16), which is to the left of D (0,16), and F at (-187,16), which is further left. So, the order would be F, E, D, C on the line. So, D, E, C, F would not be in order. Hmm, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, so the order is D, then E, then C, then F. So, in that case, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.

But in this case, our calculations gave E at (-3,16) and F at (-187,16), which are both to the left of D. So, that would make the order F, E, D, C on the line, which is the opposite of what the problem states. So, maybe this solution is invalid.

Alternatively, if g = -95,

then e + f = -2*(-95) = 190,

and e*f = 561.

So, the quadratic equation is x² -190x + 561 = 0.

Wait, let me compute the roots:

x = [190 ± sqrt(190² - 4*1*561)] / 2

Which is [190 ± sqrt(36100 - 2244)] / 2 = [190 ± sqrt(33856)] / 2.

sqrt(33856) is 184.

So,

x = (190 + 184)/2 = 374/2 = 187,

and x = (190 - 184)/2 = 6/2 = 3.

So, e and f are 3 and 187.

So, |f - e| = |187 - 3| = 184, which fits.

Now, in this case, since EF is 184, and e and f are 3 and 187, which are both on the line y=16.

So, if E is at (3,16) and F is at (187,16), then the order on the line is D(0,16), E(3,16), C(107,16), F(187,16). So, D, E, C, F are collinear in that order, which matches the problem statement.

Okay, so this makes sense. So, E is at (3,16), F is at (187,16).

So, now, we can find G and H.

Since rectangle EFGH is E(3,16), F(187,16), G, H.

In a rectangle, the sides are perpendicular, so FG is vertical. So, FG is from F(187,16) to G(187,16 +17) = (187,33) or G(187,16 -17) = (187,-1).

Wait, is FG vertical? Because EF is horizontal, so FG would be vertical. So, if FG is 17 units, then G is either 17 units above or below F.

But in the problem, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Since A is at (0,0), D is at (0,16), let's see where G is.

If G is at (187,33), then H would be at (3,33), because in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and parallel, so from E(3,16) moving the same way as from F(187,16) to G(187,33), which is upwards. So, moving from E(3,16) upwards 17 units to H(3,33).

Alternatively, if G is at (187,-1), then H would be at (3,-1).

So, let's check both possibilities.

First, case 1: G is at (187,33), H is at (3,33).

Then, points A(0,0), D(0,16), G(187,33), H(3,33) lie on a circle.

Let me verify if these four points are concyclic.

Alternatively, since we already had the circle equation earlier, maybe it's consistent.

Earlier, when we considered G at (f,33) and H at (e,33), we had e=3, f=187, which gave us the circle equation. So, in this case, it fits.

So, the circle passes through A(0,0), D(0,16), G(187,33), H(3,33).

Similarly, if G were at (187,-1) and H at (3,-1), let's check if those points lie on the same circle.

Wait, but in that case, H would be at (3,-1). Then, points A(0,0), D(0,16), G(187,-1), H(3,-1).

But let's see if these four points can lie on a circle.

Let me compute the circle equation.

But earlier, we found that e and f are 3 and 187, and g = -95, f = -8, c=0.

Wait, in our earlier calculation, the equation was x² + y² + 2gx -16y = 0, with g = -95.

So, substituting g = -95, equation becomes x² + y² - 190x -16y = 0.

Let me check if point G(187,33) lies on this circle.

Left side: (187)^2 + (33)^2 -190*187 -16*33.

Compute 187²: 187*187. Let me compute 180² = 32400, 7²=49, 2*180*7=2520. So, (180+7)^2 = 32400 + 2520 +49 = 34969.

33² = 1089.

190*187: 200*187=37400, subtract 10*187=1870 → 37400 -1870=35530.

16*33=528.

So,

34969 + 1089 = 36058,

-35530 -528 = -36058.

So, 36058 -36058 = 0. So, yes, G(187,33) is on the circle.

Similarly, H(3,33):

3² + 33² -190*3 -16*33.

9 + 1089 = 1098,

-570 -528 = -1098.

So, 1098 - 1098 = 0. So H is on the circle.

Similarly, point A(0,0):

0 +0 -0 -0=0. So, yes.

Point D(0,16):

0 + 256 -0 -256=0. So yes.

Thus, all four points lie on the circle.

So, the first case is valid.

But what about the second case, where G is at (187,-1) and H at (3,-1)?

Let me check if these points lie on the same circle.

Check if G(187,-1) is on the circle x² + y² -190x -16y =0.

Compute 187² + (-1)^2 -190*187 -16*(-1).

187²=34969, (-1)^2=1.

190*187=35530, 16*(-1)= -16.

So,

34969 + 1 -35530 +16 = (34970) -35530 +16 = (-560) +16 = -544 ≠ 0.

So, G(187,-1) is not on the circle.

Similarly, check H(3,-1):

3² + (-1)^2 -190*3 -16*(-1) =9 +1 -570 +16= 10 -570 +16= -544 ≠0.

So, H is not on the circle either.

Thus, the second case is invalid, which means that G is at (187,33) and H at (3,33).

So, now we have all points of rectangle EFGH: E(3,16), F(187,16), G(187,33), H(3,33).

Now, the problem asks for CE. Point C is at (107,16), and E is at (3,16). Since both are on the line y=16, the distance CE is |107 -3| = 104.

Wait, that's straightforward. CE is horizontal, so it's just the difference in x-coordinates.

But let me confirm.

Point C is at (107,16), E is at (3,16). So, distance CE = sqrt( (107-3)^2 + (16-16)^2 ) = sqrt(104^2 + 0) = 104.

So, CE is 104 units. So the final answer is 104.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve for the length of \( CE \), we analyze the given conditions and use coordinate geometry.

1. **Assign Coordinates to Rectangle \( ABCD \):**
   - Let \( A(0,0) \), \( B(107,0) \), \( C(107,16) \), and \( D(0,16) \).

2. **Determine Coordinates of Points \( E \) and \( F \):**
   - Since \( D, E, C, F \) are collinear on the line \( y = 16 \), and \( EF = 184 \), we assign \( E(e,16) \) and \( F(f,16) \) such that \( |f - e| = 184 \).

3. **Use Circle Condition:**
   - Points \( A(0,0) \), \( D(0,16) \), \( G \), and \( H \) lie on a circle. The general circle equation is \( x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0 \). Substituting \( A \) and \( D \) gives \( c = 0 \) and \( f = -8 \). The equation becomes \( x^2 + y^2 - 190x - 16y = 0 \).

4. **Solve for \( e \) and \( f \):**
   - Substituting \( G(f,33) \) and \( H(e,33) \) into the circle equation, we solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 190x + 561 = 0 \). The roots are \( e = 3 \) and \( f = 187 \), giving \( E(3,16) \) and \( F(187,16) \).

5. **Determine Coordinates of \( G \) and \( H \):**
   - Since \( EFGH \) is a rectangle, \( G \) is at \( (187,33) \) and \( H \) is at \( (3,33) \).

6. **Calculate \( CE \):**
   - \( C \) is at \( (107,16) \) and \( E \) is at \( (3,16) \). The distance \( CE \) is the horizontal distance between them: \( |107 - 3| = 104 \).

Thus, the length of \( CE \) is \(\boxed{104}\).
