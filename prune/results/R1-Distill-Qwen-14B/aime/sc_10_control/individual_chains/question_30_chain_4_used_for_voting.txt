Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where ω is a 13th root of unity and ω ≠ 1. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I know that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, which means ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω over the rationals is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. So that might come in handy later.

Now, the expression given is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write that out more clearly:

Product = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

I need to find this product modulo 1000. Hmm, that seems complicated, but maybe there's a way to simplify the product first.

Let me think about each term in the product. Each term is of the form 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or relate it to something else. Let's see:

Let me write the term as 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}.

Alternatively, maybe factor it differently. Let me see if I can write it as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me set z = ω^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2z + z².

So the expression is z² - 2z + 2. Hmm, that's a quadratic. Maybe it factors or relates to some cyclotomic polynomial?

Let me check the discriminant of this quadratic: D = (-2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i.

So the quadratic factors as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). So, 2 - 2z + z² = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).

Wait, so each term in the product can be written as (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product becomes the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, that's the same as [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].

Hmm, I've seen something like this before. Since ω is a primitive 13th root, the product over k=0 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is equal to x¹³ - 1, because the roots of x¹³ - 1 are exactly the 13th roots of unity.

But wait, we're taking the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - a), where a is some constant. Let me write that as (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = (-1)^13 * (a^{13} - 1), because the product of (a - ω^k) for all k is the minimal polynomial evaluated at a, which is a^{13} - 1. Since the cyclotomic polynomial is degree 12, but x^{13} - 1 factors as (x - 1)Φ₁₃(x), so the product over k=1 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is Φ₁₃(x), but in this case, we have from k=0 to 12, so it includes ω^0 = 1.

Wait, let me clarify. The product over k=0 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is x^{13} - 1. So, if I have product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^{13} - 1.

Wait, but in our case, the product is product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) multiplied by (-1)^{13} (since each term is (a - ω^k) = (-1)(ω^k - a)).

So, product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = (-1)^{13} product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = (-1)^{13} (a^{13} - 1) = - (a^{13} - 1).

So, for a = 1 + i, we have product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) = -[(1 + i)^13 - 1].

Similarly, product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i)) = -[(1 - i)^13 - 1].

Therefore, the original product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].

Simplifying, that's [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ] = [ -1 * ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ -1 * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ] = (-1)^2 * [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ] = [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ].

So, the product simplifies to [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].

Hmm, okay, now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Let me recall that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. Since 1 + i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle π/4 radians (45 degrees). Similarly, 1 - i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -π/4.

So, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}, so (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * π/4}.

Let me compute [sqrt(2)]^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

Now, the angles. Let's compute 13 * π/4. Since 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13π/4 = 3π + π/4. But 3π is equivalent to π + 2π, which is the same angle as π, but since angles are modulo 2π, 13π/4 is equal to 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4. Similarly, for (1 - i)^13, the angle is -13π/4, which is the same as -13π/4 + 4π = -13π/4 + 16π/4 = 3π/4.

Wait, let me double-check that. 13 * π/4 is indeed 3π + π/4, which is 3π + π/4. Since 3π is more than 2π, subtracting 2π gives 3π + π/4 - 2π = π + π/4 = 5π/4. But e^{iθ} is periodic with period 2π, so e^{i13π/4} = e^{i5π/4}.

Similarly, for (1 - i)^13, the angle is -13π/4. Let's compute that modulo 2π. Let's add multiples of 2π until it's within 0 to 2π. So, -13π/4 + 4π = -13π/4 + 16π/4 = 3π/4. So, e^{-i13π/4} = e^{i3π/4}.

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i5π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i3π/4}.

Now, let's compute e^{i5π/4} and e^{i3π/4}.

e^{i5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = (-√2/2) - i√2/2.

e^{i3π/4} = cos(3π/4) + i sin(3π/4) = (-√2/2) + i√2/2.

So, plugging these back in:

(1 + i)^13 = 64√2 * (-√2/2 - i√2/2) = 64√2 * (-√2/2)(1 + i).

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64√2 * (-√2/2 + i√2/2) = 64√2 * (-√2/2)(1 - i).

Wait, let me compute each step carefully.

Compute (1 + i)^13:

64√2 * [ (-√2/2) + (-i√2/2) ] = 64√2 * (-√2/2) [1 + i] = 64 * (- (2)/2 ) [1 + i] = Wait, wait, let's compute step by step.

Wait, 64√2 multiplied by (-√2/2) is 64 * [√2 * (-√2)/2] = 64 * [ (-2)/2 ] = 64 * (-1) = -64.

Similarly, the imaginary part is 64√2 * (-√2/2 i) = 64 * [ (√2)(-√2)/2 ] i = 64 * (-2/2) i = -64i.

Wait, maybe I should recompute:

(1 + i)^13 = 64√2 * [ (-√2/2) - i√2/2 ]

Let me compute 64√2 * (-√2/2):

= 64 * (√2 * -√2 / 2 )

= 64 * ( -2 / 2 )

= 64 * (-1) = -64.

Similarly, the imaginary part: 64√2 * (-√2/2 i) = 64 * ( -2 / 2 ) i = -64i.

So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64√2 * [ (-√2/2) + i√2/2 ]

Compute 64√2 * (-√2/2):

Same as above, 64 * ( -2 / 2 ) = -64.

Imaginary part: 64√2 * (√2/2 i) = 64 * (2/2) i = 64i.

So, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.

Now, I need to compute [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] and [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].

So:

(1 + i)^13 - 1 = (-64 - 64i) - 1 = -65 - 64i.

(1 - i)^13 - 1 = (-64 + 64i) - 1 = -65 + 64i.

So, the product becomes (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i).

This is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to the square of the modulus.

Which is (-65)^2 + (64)^2.

Compute that:

(-65)^2 = 4225.

64^2 = 4096.

So, 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Wait, let me compute 4225 + 4096:

4000 + 4000 = 8000.

225 + 96 = 321.

So, 8000 + 321 = 8321.

Wait, but wait, let me check 4225 + 4096.

4225 + 4096:

4225 + 4000 = 8225.

8225 + 96 = 8321. Yes, correct.

So, the product is 8321.

But wait, that can't be right because 65^2 is 4225, and 64^2 is 4096, so 4225 + 4096 is indeed 8321. So the product is 8321.

Wait, but wait, 8321 is a positive integer. So, the original product is 8321. Now, the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000.

So, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, the remainder is 321.

Wait, but hold on a second. I thought I might have made a mistake because 8321 seems a bit low, but let me double-check.

Wait, let's go back step by step.

We had:

Product = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ]

Computed:

(1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i

(1 - i)^13 = -64 +64i

Subtract 1:

-65 -64i and -65 +64i.

Multiply these two: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * (-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, 8321 mod 1000 is the last three digits, which is 321.

Wait, but let me confirm 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321. So, yes, the remainder is 321.

But wait, is that the actual value of the product? Because 8321 is a positive integer, but I thought the product is over complex numbers, but the product ends up being real. That makes sense because the product is the product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's real.

But let me just check whether I correctly carried out all the steps.

1. Expressed each term as (z^2 - 2z + 2) where z = ω^k.

2. Factored each term as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).

3. Then, the entire product becomes the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i)) times the same for (1 - i).

4. Then, recognized that product over k=0 to 12 of (a - ω^k) is a^13 - 1.

5. So, the product over (ω^k - a) is - (a^13 - 1).

6. So, [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ] = [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].

7. Then, computed (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 using polar form.

8. Found each to be -64 -64i and -64 +64i.

9. Subtracted 1 to get -65 -64i and -65 +64i.

10. Multiplied them together to get 8321.

11. Then, mod 1000, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

So, all the steps seem to check out.

Wait, but just to make sure, perhaps I should compute (1 + i)^13 directly without using polar form.

Wait, 1 + i is sqrt(2) e^{iπ/4}, so (1 + i)^13 is (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13π/4}.

(sqrt(2))^13 is 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2), which is correct.

e^{i13π/4} = e^{i(3π + π/4)} = e^{iπ/4} * e^{i3π} = e^{iπ/4} * (-1). Since e^{i3π} = e^{iπ} = -1.

So, e^{i13π/4} = - e^{iπ/4} = - (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ) = - sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.

Multiply by 64 sqrt(2):

(64 sqrt(2)) * (- sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * [ (-2)/2 - i (-2)/2 ] = 64*(-1 - i) = -64 -64i. Which is correct.

Similarly for (1 - i)^13.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute (1 + i)^13 directly using binomial theorem, but that would be tedious, but let's see an alternative.

Wait, another approach: Since 1 + i = √2 e^{iπ/4}, so (1 + i)^13 = (√2)^13 e^{i13π/4}.

Which is 2^{13/2} e^{i(3π + π/4)}. 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).

e^{i(3π + π/4)} = e^{iπ/4} * e^{i3π} = e^{iπ/4}*(-1) = -e^{iπ/4} = - (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).

Multiply by 64 sqrt(2):

64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * [ (-2)/2 + (-i 2)/2 ) ] = 64*(-1 -i) = -64 -64i.

Same result as before. So, I'm confident that (1 + i)^13 is -64 -64i and (1 - i)^13 is -64 +64i.

Subtract 1 from each:

(1 + i)^13 - 1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.

(1 - i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.

Multiply them: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).

Which is (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 +4096=8321.

Yes, so 8321 is correct. Then, mod 1000 is 321.

Wait, so is that the final answer? 321.

But just to make sure, perhaps I can think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps recognize that the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) can be rewritten in terms of cyclotomic polynomials or minimal polynomials.

Wait, let's think about the expression 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}.

Let me write this as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2.

Wait, perhaps it's the evaluation of some polynomial at ω^k.

Let me consider the polynomial f(x) = x² - 2x + 2.

Then, f(ω^k) = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2, which is exactly the term in the product.

So, the product is ∏_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k).

But since ω^k are the roots of x¹³ -1 =0, then the product becomes ∏_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k) = ?

Wait, I remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product over the roots α of (f(α)) is equal to the resultant of f and the minimal polynomial of α, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, more straightforwardly, ∏_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2).

But that's the same as ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) which is the original product.

Hmm, but perhaps another way: the product of f(ω^k) over k=0 to 12 is equal to the product over all 13th roots of unity of f(ω^k).

Wait, but in this case, ω^k are all the 13th roots, including 1. So, product_{ω^13=1} f(ω). Which is the same as product_{x^{13}=1} (x² - 2x + 2).

But I think there's a theorem that says that the product of f(ω^k) over all k is equal to the resultant of x^{13} -1 and f(x), but perhaps more simply, it's the product of f(ω^k) for each root ω^k of x^{13} -1.

Alternatively, since x^{13} -1 factors as ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k), then the product over k=0 to 12 of f(ω^k) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^{13} -1.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that ∏_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2).

Let me make a substitution: Let y = ω^k. Then, as y ranges over all 13th roots of unity, y^13 =1, and y^0=1, y^1, y^2, ..., y^12.

So, ∏_{y^13=1} (y² - 2y + 2).

So, that's the product over all y with y^13=1 of (y² - 2y + 2).

I remember that the product over y^m=1 of (y - a) is equal to a^m -1 if m is the order, but here it's a quadratic in y.

Wait, perhaps consider that the product over y^13=1 of (y² - 2y + 2) is equal to the resultant of y² - 2y + 2 and y^{13} - 1.

But I'm not too familiar with resultants. Alternatively, perhaps think of it as the value of the polynomial g(y) = y² - 2y + 2 evaluated at all 13th roots of unity, and then take the product.

But another idea: Let's consider that for any polynomial h(y), the product over y^13=1 of h(y) is equal to the product of h(y) for each y being a 13th root. So, perhaps express this as h(y) = y² - 2y + 2.

Wait, perhaps if I write the product as ∏_{y^13=1} (y² - 2y + 2) = ∏_{y^13=1} (y - (1 + i))(y - (1 - i)).

Wait, that seems similar to what I did earlier. So, the product becomes ∏_{y^13=1} (y - (1 + i)) * ∏_{y^13=1} (y - (1 - i)).

But for each product, ∏_{y^13=1} (y - a) = a^13 - 1, so:

∏_{y^13=1} (y - (1 + i)) = (1 + i)^13 -1

Similarly, ∏_{y^13=1} (y - (1 - i)) = (1 - i)^13 -1

So, the product is [(1 + i)^13 -1] * [(1 - i)^13 -1], which is exactly what I had before, leading to 8321.

So, that confirms that approach.

Therefore, the product is 8321, mod 1000 is 321.

Just to make sure, perhaps compute 8321 mod 1000.

8321 divided by 1000 is 8 * 1000 = 8000. 8321 -8000=321.

Yes, correct.

So, the remainder is 321.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The given problem involves computing the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity.

First, we rewrite each term in the product as \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\), which can be factored as \((\omega^k - (1 + i))(\omega^k - (1 - i))\). Thus, the entire product becomes:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \left( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i)) \right) \left( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i)) \right)
\]

Using the property of roots of unity, we know that \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \omega^k) = x^{13} - 1\). Therefore:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - a) = - (a^{13} - 1)
\]

Applying this to both products:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i)) = - ((1 + i)^{13} - 1)
\]
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i)) = - ((1 - i)^{13} - 1)
\]

Next, we compute \((1 + i)^{13}\) and \((1 - i)^{13}\). Expressing \(1 + i\) and \(1 - i\) in polar form:

\[
1 + i = \sqrt{2} e^{i\pi/4}, \quad 1 - i = \sqrt{2} e^{-i\pi/4}
\]

Raising to the 13th power:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} = ( \sqrt{2} )^{13} e^{i 13 \pi / 4} = 64 \sqrt{2} e^{i 5\pi/4} = -64 - 64i
\]
\[
(1 - i)^{13} = ( \sqrt{2} )^{13} e^{-i 13 \pi / 4} = 64 \sqrt{2} e^{-i 5\pi/4} = -64 + 64i
\]

Subtracting 1 from each:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} - 1 = -65 - 64i, \quad (1 - i)^{13} - 1 = -65 + 64i
\]

Multiplying these results:

\[
(-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321
\]

Finally, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is:

\[
8321 \mod 1000 = 321
\]

Thus, the remainder is \(\boxed{321}\).
