Okay, let me try to solve this problem step by step. So, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk every morning and then stops at a coffee shop. The problem gives me information about her walking speed and the time it takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the coffee shop time. 

First, let me note down all the given information to make it clearer. 

When Aya walks at a constant speed of s km/h, her total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes at the coffee shop. So the actual walking time plus the coffee shop time is 4 hours. 

Similarly, when she increases her speed to s + 2 km/h, her total time becomes 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is the same as 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours, but let me think in terms of fractions to be precise. 24 minutes is 24/60 hours, which simplifies to 0.4 hours, so 2.4 hours total. 

Wait, but maybe it's better to keep the times in minutes to avoid confusion, especially since the coffee shop time is given in minutes. Hmm, maybe I should convert all times to minutes. 

Wait, 4 hours is 240 minutes, and 2 hours 24 minutes is (2*60) +24= 120+24=144 minutes. 

So, let's think in terms of minutes. 

When her speed is s km/h, walking time is total time minus coffee shop time. So, walking time = 240 - t minutes. 

Similarly, when her speed is s+2 km/h, walking time is 144 - t minutes. 

But wait, the walking time should be the distance divided by speed. The distance is 9 km in both cases. 

So, the walking time in minutes when speed is s is (9/s) hours converted to minutes, which is (9/s)*60 minutes. Similarly, when speed is s+2, the walking time is (9/(s+2))*60 minutes. 

But those walking times should equal the total time minus the coffee shop time. So, we can set up two equations. 

First equation: (9/s)*60 = 240 - t 

Second equation: (9/(s+2))*60 = 144 - t 

So, we have two equations with two variables, s and t. Let me write them out clearly. 

Equation 1: (540)/s = 240 - t 

Equation 2: (540)/(s+2) = 144 - t 

Hmm, so now I can solve these equations. Let me subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t. 

So, (540/s) - (540/(s+2)) = (240 - t) - (144 - t) 

Simplify the right side: 240 - t -144 + t = 96 

Left side: 540/s - 540/(s+2) 

So, 540*(1/s - 1/(s+2)) = 96 

Factor out 540: 540*( (s+2 - s)/(s(s+2)) ) = 96 

Simplify numerator: 540*(2)/(s(s+2)) ) =96 

So, 1080 / (s(s+2)) = 96 

Multiply both sides by s(s+2): 1080 =96 s(s+2) 

Divide both sides by 96 to simplify: 1080 /96 = s(s+2) 

Calculate 1080 ÷ 96: Let's see, 96 *11=1056, 96*11.25= 1080. So, 11.25. 

So, s(s+2)=11.25 

Now, let me write that as s² + 2s -11.25 =0 

This is a quadratic equation: s² +2s -11.25=0 

I can solve for s using quadratic formula. 

s = [ -2 ± sqrt( (2)^2 -4*1*(-11.25) ) ]/(2*1) 

Compute discriminant: 4 +45=49 

So sqrt(49)=7 

Thus, s = [ -2 ±7 ]/2 

We can ignore the negative solution since speed can't be negative. 

So, s=( -2 +7 )/2 =5/2=2.5 km/h 

So, her original speed is 2.5 km/h. 

Now, let's find t. Using equation 1: 540/s =240 -t 

s=2.5, so 540 /2.5 =216 

So, 216 =240 -t → t=240-216=24 minutes 

So, the coffee shop time is 24 minutes. 

Now, the question asks: what's the time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h. 

s + 1/2 =2.5 +0.5=3 km/h. 

So, her new speed is 3 km/h. 

The walking time is 9 km /3 km/h=3 hours. 

But wait, 3 hours is 180 minutes. But we need to include the coffee shop time, which is 24 minutes. 

So, total time is 180 +24=204 minutes. 

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because when she walked at 2.5 km/h, her total time was 240 minutes, which was 4 hours. Her walking time was 216 minutes, which is 3.6 hours, so 9 km at 2.5 km/h is indeed 3.6 hours, which is 216 minutes. So, the walk time is 216 minutes, and coffee shop is 24 minutes for a total of 240. 

Similarly, at 3.5 km/h, her walking time would be 9/(3.5) hours. Let me calculate that. 

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the problem says s + 1/2, which is 2.5 + 0.5=3. So, 3 km/h. 

So, 9 km at 3 km/h is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. But the coffee shop is 24 minutes, so total time is 180 +24=204 minutes. 

Wait, but let me check if that makes sense. 

Wait, when she walked at 2.5 km/h, it took 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. When she walks faster, the total time should be less. At 3 km/h, the time should be less than 4 hours. 204 minutes is 3 hours and 24 minutes, which is less than 4 hours. That makes sense. 

Wait, but let me verify using the initial equations. 

We found s=2.5, t=24. 

Let me check equation 2: (540)/(s+2)=144 - t 

s+2=4.5 km/h 

540/4.5=120 

144 - t=144 -24=120. So, yes, correct. 

So, now, when speed is s +1/2=3 km/h, the walking time is 9/3=3 hours=180 minutes. Add t=24 minutes, total is 204 minutes. 

Wait, but the problem says "the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop." So, 180 +24=204 minutes. 

Wait, but the problem is asking for the number of minutes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 3 km/h. So, yes, 204 minutes is the answer. 

Wait, is there any chance I made a mistake in the calculations? Let me think again. 

We have s=2.5, t=24. 

So, at 3 km/h, walk time is 9/3=3 h=180 min. Plus 24 min coffee: 204. 

Alternatively, another way to think about it: the difference in time when speed increases by 2 km/h is 240-144=96 minutes. 

But let's just stick with the calculations. 

So, the answer is 204 minutes.

Aya's walking speed and total time are given for two scenarios. By setting up equations based on the distance, speed, and time relationship, we solve for her speed \( s \) and coffee shop time \( t \). Using these values, we calculate the total time when she walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h, including the coffee shop time.

The final answer is \(\boxed{204}\).
