Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how long Aya's walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. Hmm, let's see. I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. So, the total distance she walks is always 9 km. But her walking speed changes, and depending on her speed, the total time she takes, including the coffee shop time, changes as well.

Wait, so the walk time plus the coffee shop time equals the total time she spends each morning. Got it. Let me note down the given information.

When she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. So, if I break this down, her walking time is 4 hours minus t minutes. But wait, I should convert everything into the same units to make it easier. Probably better to use hours for time.

Wait, 4 hours is 4 hours, and t minutes is t/60 hours because 60 minutes equal 1 hour. So, the time she spends walking is 4 - (t/60) hours. But the distance is 9 km, and speed is s km/h, so time is distance divided by speed. That means:

Walking time = 9 / s = 4 - (t/60)

Similarly, when she walks at s + 2 km/h, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes in the coffee shop. Let me convert 2 hours and 24 minutes into hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 hours, which is 0.4 hours. So, 2.4 hours in total. Again, the coffee shop time is t minutes, which is t/60 hours. So, her walking time is 2.4 - (t/60) hours. And the distance is still 9 km, so:

Walking time = 9 / (s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

So now I have two equations:

1) 9/s = 4 - (t/60)
2) 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

Hmm, okay, so I can set up a system of equations with these two. Let me write them more clearly.

Equation 1:
9/s = 4 - (t/60)

Equation 2:
9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

I can solve these two equations to find s and t. Once I have s, I can then find the time it takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

Let me denote (t/60) as a variable to make it easier. Let me call it, say, x. So, x = t/60. Then, the equations become:

1) 9/s = 4 - x
2) 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - x

So now, I have:

Equation 1: 9/s = 4 - x
Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - x

Let me subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate x. But wait, not subtract, but maybe express x from both and set them equal.

From Equation 1: x = 4 - (9/s)
From Equation 2: x = 2.4 - (9/(s + 2))

So, setting them equal:

4 - (9/s) = 2.4 - (9/(s + 2))

Let me compute 4 - 2.4 first. That's 1.6. So,

1.6 = (9/s) - (9/(s + 2))

Hmm, okay. Let me factor out the 9:

1.6 = 9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)]

Compute the difference inside the brackets: 1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So now, 1.6 = 9 * [2/(s(s + 2))]

Simplify that:

1.6 = 18 / [s(s + 2)]

Let me rewrite this equation:

s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6

Compute 18 / 1.6. Let's see, 1.6 is 8/5, so 18 divided by (8/5) is 18 * (5/8) = (90)/8 = 11.25

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25

Expanding the left side: s² + 2s = 11.25

Bring 11.25 to the left: s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

So, quadratic equation: s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Let me solve for s. Using the quadratic formula:

s = [ -2 ± sqrt( (2)^2 - 4 *1*(-11.25) ) ] / (2*1)

Compute discriminant:

(2)^2 = 4
4 *1*11.25 = 45
So, discriminant is 4 + 45 = 49

Square root of 49 is 7.

So, s = [ -2 ±7 ] / 2

We can ignore the negative speed, so:

s = ( -2 +7 ) /2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h

Wait, so s is 2.5 km/h. Let me check that.

So, s = 2.5 km/h. Then, s + 2 = 4.5 km/h.

Now, let's find x, which is t/60.

From Equation 1: x = 4 - (9/s) = 4 - (9 / 2.5 )

Compute 9 / 2.5: 2.5 goes into 9 three times (2.5 *3=7.5), with 1.5 remaining. 1.5 /2.5 = 0.6. So, 3 + 0.6 = 3.6

So, x = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 hours.

Since x = t/60, then t = 0.4 *60 = 24 minutes.

Wait, so t is 24 minutes. Seems reasonable. Let me check with Equation 2.

From Equation 2: x = 2.4 - (9/(s +2)) = 2.4 - (9 /4.5 )

9 /4.5 = 2, so x = 2.4 -2 = 0.4 hours. Yep, same result. So, x is 0.4, so t is 24 minutes.

So, now, the question is: Suppose Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

So, s is 2.5 km/h. s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

So, her walking speed is 3 km/h. The total time she takes is walking time plus coffee shop time.

Walking time is distance divided by speed. Distance is 9 km, speed is 3 km/h, so walking time is 9 /3 = 3 hours.

Plus coffee shop time of 24 minutes. So total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes.

But the question asks for the number of minutes, including t. So, 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 204 minutes.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Wait, when she walks at 3 km/h, the time taken is 9 /3 = 3 hours. So, 3 hours walking plus 24 minutes coffee shop. So, total time is 3*60 +24 = 180 +24 =204 minutes.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the answer is 204 minutes.

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given information. Aya walks 9 km at different speeds and spends a fixed amount of time, \( t \) minutes, in a coffee shop. We are given two scenarios:

1. At speed \( s \) km/h, the total time (walking + coffee shop) is 4 hours.
2. At speed \( s + 2 \) km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes.

First, convert the total times into hours:
- 4 hours remains 4 hours.
- 2 hours and 24 minutes is \( 2 + \frac{24}{60} = 2.4 \) hours.

Let \( t \) minutes be the coffee shop time. Convert \( t \) minutes to hours: \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours.

From the problem:
- Walking time at \( s \) km/h is \( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours, and the walking time is \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours.
- Walking time at \( s + 2 \) km/h is \( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours, and the walking time is \( \frac{9}{s + 2} \) hours.

This gives us two equations:
1. \( \frac{9}{s} = 4 - \frac{t}{60} \)
2. \( \frac{9}{s + 2} = 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \)

Let \( x = \frac{t}{60} \). The equations become:
1. \( \frac{9}{s} = 4 - x \)
2. \( \frac{9}{s + 2} = 2.4 - x \)

Subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[
4 - x - (2.4 - x) = \frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s + 2}
\]
Simplify:
\[
1.6 = 9 \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s + 2} \right)
\]
\[
1.6 = 9 \left( \frac{2}{s(s + 2)} \right)
\]
\[
1.6 = \frac{18}{s(s + 2)}
\]
\[
s(s + 2) = \frac{18}{1.6} = 11.25
\]
\[
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
\]

Solving the quadratic equation:
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
Taking the positive root:
\[
s = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \, \text{km/h}
\]

Now, find \( x \) (and thus \( t \)):
From \( \frac{9}{2.5} = 3.6 \):
\[
x = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 \, \text{hours} \implies t = 0.4 \times 60 = 24 \, \text{minutes}
\]

When Aya walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h, the walking time is:
\[
\frac{9}{3} = 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{minutes}
\]
Including the coffee shop time:
\[
180 + 24 = 204 \, \text{minutes}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{204}
\]
