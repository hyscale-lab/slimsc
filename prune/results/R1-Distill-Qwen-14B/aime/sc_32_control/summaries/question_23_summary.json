      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses ABCD on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. The rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, no, actually, they bisect each other but not necessarily at right angles unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals do bisect the angles and they are perpendicular. So they intersect at right angles. So, in a rhombus, diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n\nBut in this problem, it's given that the diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the point where the diagonals meet is the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if point A is (x, y), then the opposite point C would be (-x, -y), right? Because the midpoint of A and C is the origin.\n\nSimilarly, the other two points B and D would also be symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if B is (p, q), then D would be (-p, -q). So, the four points are A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), D(-p, -q).\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, and so on. Let me write that down.\n\nDistance AB = Distance BC = Distance CD = Distance DA.\n\nAlternatively, since all sides are equal, perhaps I can use vectors to represent the sides. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parameterize points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola.\n\nSince all four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, their coordinates must satisfy this equation. So, for point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, same for point B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24=1, etc.\n\nBut now, the rhombus has diagonals intersecting at the origin. So, the diagonals are AC and BD. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular to each other, right? So, the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular.\n\nWait, but the diagonals of a rhombus are not only perpendicular but also bisect each other. Since the origin is the midpoint, that's already satisfied. So, the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular.\n\nSo, the vectors AC would be from A to C, which is (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Wait, but alternatively, since AC is a diagonal, its vector is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from B to D, which is (-2p, -2q).\n\nWait, but if the diagonals are perpendicular, then their dot product should be zero. So, AC \u00b7 BD = 0.\n\nSo, (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0 \u2192 4xp + 4yq = 0 \u2192 xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, the condition for perpendicular diagonals is xp + yq = 0.\n\nHmm, that's a useful condition.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, in addition, the sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C, etc.\n\nLet me compute AB\u00b2 and BC\u00b2.\n\nAB\u00b2 = (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2.\n\nBC\u00b2 = (-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2.\n\nSince AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2, we have:\n\n(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2.\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side: (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2) + (q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2).\n\nRight side: (-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2 = (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2 = (x\u00b2 + 2px + p\u00b2) + (y\u00b2 + 2qy + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, set left = right:\n\np\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2px + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2qy + q\u00b2.\n\nSubtracting the right side from both sides:\n\n(-2px - 2qy) - (2px + 2qy) = 0 \u2192 -4px -4qy = 0 \u2192 px + qy = 0.\n\nWait, but earlier we had xp + yq = 0 from the diagonals being perpendicular, which is the same as px + qy = 0. So, this condition is automatically satisfied. So, that doesn't give us any new information.\n\nHmm, that suggests that perhaps the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular is equivalent to the sides being equal? Or maybe not, perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider another pair of sides. Let's take another pair, say, AB and AD.\n\nWait, AB is from A to B, AD is from A to D. But in a rhombus, adjacent sides are equal. So, AB\u00b2 = AD\u00b2.\n\nSo, AB\u00b2 is (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2.\n\nAD\u00b2 is (-p - x)^2 + (-q - y)^2.\n\nSo, set AB\u00b2 equal to AD\u00b2:\n\n(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (-p - x)^2 + (-q - y)^2.\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft: p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2.\n\nRight: (p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2 = p\u00b2 + 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qy + y\u00b2.\n\nSet left = right:\n\np\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qy + y\u00b2.\n\nSubtracting p\u00b2, x\u00b2, q\u00b2, y\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n-2px -2qy = 2px + 2qy.\n\nBringing all terms to one side:\n\n-2px -2qy -2px -2qy = 0 \u2192 -4px -4qy =0 \u2192 4px +4qy =0 \u2192 px + qy = 0.\n\nAgain, same condition as before. So, perhaps the only condition we get is px + qy = 0, which comes from the diagonals being perpendicular.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing another condition. Maybe the sides are equal, not just AB=BC, but also AB=AD or something else.\n\nWait, no, in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so AB=BC=CD=DA. So, perhaps I only need one condition because the others are similar.\n\nHmm, maybe I should think differently. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and the diagonals are AC and BD, with midpoints at the origin.\n\nMoreover, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal unless it's a square, but in a hyperbola, it's unlikely to have a square unless it's aligned in a certain way.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the hyperbola is given by x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, which is a standard east-west opening hyperbola.\n\nSo, the asymptotes are y = \u00b1(sqrt(24)/sqrt(20))x = \u00b1(sqrt(6)/sqrt(5))x \u2248 \u00b11.095x.\n\nSo, the asymptotes are not perpendicular, which makes sense because hyperbola asymptotes are not perpendicular unless it's a rectangular hyperbola, which this is not.\n\nSo, the diagonals BD and AC are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nSo, if diagonal AC has slope m, then BD has slope -1/m.\n\nBut AC is from A(x,y) to C(-x,-y), so the slope is (-y - y)/(-x -x) = (-2y)/(-2x) = y/x.\n\nSimilarly, BD is from B(p,q) to D(-p,-q), so the slope is (-q - q)/(-p - p) = (-2q)/(-2p) = q/p.\n\nSo, the product of the slopes is (y/x)*(q/p) = yq/(xp) = -1 because the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nSo, yq/(xp) = -1 \u2192 yq = -xp \u2192 yq + xp =0, which is the same as before, xp + yq =0.\n\nSo, that's the same condition.\n\nSo, now, given that, perhaps I can parameterize points A and B on the hyperbola.\n\nLet me think about parametrizing points on the hyperbola.\n\nFor hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2=1, a standard parametrization is x = a sec\u03b8, y = b tan\u03b8. Alternatively, we can use hyperbolic functions: x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t.\n\nBut since hyperbola has two branches, and the points are on the same hyperbola, perhaps we can use this.\n\nAlternatively, since all four points are on the hyperbola, perhaps I can represent them in terms of parameters. Let me try to parameterize points A and B with parameters t and s or something.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to represent points A and B as points on the hyperbola, with coordinates (x, y) and (p, q), respectively, satisfying x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1 and p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24=1.\n\nAnd the condition that xp + yq =0.\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\n2. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1.\n\n3. xp + yq =0.\n\nOur goal is to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD. So, BD is the distance between points B(p, q) and D(-p, -q). So, BD distance is sqrt[ ( -p - p )\u00b2 + ( -q - q )\u00b2 ] = sqrt[ (-2p)^2 + (-2q)^2 ] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 +4q\u00b2] = 2 sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 is [2 sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)]\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nWe need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, we need to find the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2, and then the answer would be the supremum of these infima? Wait, no, wait. The question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's asking for the minimal upper bound for BD\u00b2 across all possible rhombuses. Wait, no, actually, it's the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, but wait, if BD\u00b2 can get as small as possible, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses.\" So, for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is some value, and we need the largest number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. So, m is the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because if BD\u00b2 can be arbitrarily small, then m would be negative infinity, which isn't the case here because BD\u00b2 is always positive. So, actually, m is the minimal possible BD\u00b2, which is the infimum, but we need the greatest m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, so m is the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, if BD\u00b2 can get as small as possible, but we need to find the greatest m that is less than all BD\u00b2. But if BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to some minimal value, then m would be that minimal value. Wait, perhaps BD\u00b2 has a minimum value, and m is that minimum.\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose that BD\u00b2 can take values from some minimum m upwards. Then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is m, because m is the smallest BD\u00b2 can be, so any number less than m would not satisfy the condition for all rhombuses (since BD\u00b2 is at least m). So, m is the minimal value of BD\u00b2 across all possible rhombuses, and the answer is m.\n\nSo, I need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, given the constraints.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nWe need to minimize 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) subject to:\n\n1. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1.\n\n2. xp + yq =0.\n\nBut we also have points A(x,y) on the hyperbola, so x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nHmm, so there are multiple variables here: x, y, p, q. But perhaps I can express p and q in terms of x and y or something.\n\nWait, since xp + yq =0, perhaps I can express one variable in terms of another. Let's say, solve for q in terms of p: q = -(xp)/y, provided y \u22600.\n\nSo, substitute q = -(xp)/y into the hyperbola equation for point B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2/20 - [ (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/y\u00b2 ] /24 =1.\n\nLet me write that:\n\np\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) =1.\n\nFactor out p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) ] =1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 [ (24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2)/(20 *24 y\u00b2) ) ] =1.\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 = [ (20 *24 y\u00b2) ] / (24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 ) .\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 20*24 y\u00b2 = 480 y\u00b2.\n\nDenominator: 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 = 4(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = (480 y\u00b2) / [4(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)] = (120 y\u00b2)/(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = (120 y\u00b2)/(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, since A(x,y) is on the hyperbola, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. Let me solve for x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 = 20(1 + y\u00b2/24) = 20 + (20 y\u00b2)/24 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nNow, substitute x\u00b2 into the denominator:\n\n6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 =6 y\u00b2 -5*(20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6) =6 y\u00b2 -100 - (25 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nConvert to a common denominator:\n\n= (36 y\u00b2)/6 -100 - (25 y\u00b2)/6 = [36 y\u00b2 -25 y\u00b2]/6 -100 = (11 y\u00b2)/6 -100.\n\nSo, denominator is (11 y\u00b2)/6 -100.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = (120 y\u00b2) / [ (11 y\u00b2)/6 -100 ) ].\n\nLet me write this as:\n\np\u00b2 = (120 y\u00b2) / [ (11 y\u00b2 -600)/6 ] = (120 y\u00b2 *6 ) / (11 y\u00b2 -600 ) = 720 y\u00b2 / (11 y\u00b2 -600 ).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 720 y\u00b2 / (11 y\u00b2 -600 ).\n\nNow, since p\u00b2 must be positive, the denominator must have the same sign as the numerator. So, 720 y\u00b2 is always positive (since y\u00b2 is non-negative, and 720 is positive). Therefore, denominator 11 y\u00b2 -600 must be positive. So,\n\n11 y\u00b2 -600 >0 \u2192 y\u00b2 >600/11 \u224854.545.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 must be greater than approximately 54.545.\n\nSo, y can be any real number with |y| > sqrt(600/11).\n\nNow, let's compute q.\n\nEarlier, we had q = -(xp)/y.\n\nSo, let's express q in terms of x and p, but since x\u00b2 is expressed in terms of y\u00b2, perhaps we can find q\u00b2 in terms of y\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, BD\u00b2 =4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nWe have p\u00b2 =720 y\u00b2/(11 y\u00b2 -600 ).\n\nAnd q = -(xp)/y.\n\nLet me compute q\u00b2.\n\nq\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/y\u00b2.\n\nWe have x\u00b2 =20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = (120 +5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = [ (120 +5 y\u00b2)/6 * p\u00b2 ] / y\u00b2.\n\nBut p\u00b2 is 720 y\u00b2/(11 y\u00b2 -600 ).\n\nSo, plug that in:\n\nq\u00b2 = [ (120 +5 y\u00b2)/6 * (720 y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 -600 ) ] / y\u00b2.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n(120 +5 y\u00b2)/6 *720 y\u00b2 = (120 +5 y\u00b2)*120 y\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nq\u00b2 = [ (120 +5 y\u00b2)*120 y\u00b2 ] / [6(11 y\u00b2 -600 ) y\u00b2 ].\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe y\u00b2 in numerator and denominator cancels out.\n\nSo,\n\nq\u00b2 = [ (120 +5 y\u00b2)*120 ] / [6(11 y\u00b2 -600 ) ].\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 120*(120 +5 y\u00b2) = 120*5(y\u00b2 +24) )= 600(y\u00b2 +24).\n\nDenominator:6*(11 y\u00b2 -600 ) =6* (11 y\u00b2 -600).\n\nSo,\n\nq\u00b2 = [600 (y\u00b2 +24 ) ] / [6 (11 y\u00b2 -600 ) ] = [100 (y\u00b2 +24 ) ] / [11 y\u00b2 -600 ].\n\nSo, now, BD\u00b2 =4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 ) =4*(720 y\u00b2/(11 y\u00b2 -600 ) + 100(y\u00b2 +24 )/(11 y\u00b2 -600 )).\n\nCombine terms:\n\n=4*[ (720 y\u00b2 +100(y\u00b2 +24 )) / (11 y\u00b2 -600 ) ].\n\nCompute numerator inside:\n\n720 y\u00b2 +100 y\u00b2 +2400 =820 y\u00b2 +2400.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 =4*(820 y\u00b2 +2400 ) / (11 y\u00b2 -600 ).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n= [4*(820 y\u00b2 +2400 ) ] / (11 y\u00b2 -600 ).\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n820 y\u00b2 +2400 = 20*(41 y\u00b2 +120).\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = [4*20*(41 y\u00b2 +120 ) ] / (11 y\u00b2 -600 ) =80*(41 y\u00b2 +120 ) / (11 y\u00b2 -600 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =80*(41 y\u00b2 +120 ) / (11 y\u00b2 -600 ).\n\nNow, we can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 =80*(41 y\u00b2 +120 ) / (11 y\u00b2 -600 ).\n\nWe can let z = y\u00b2, so z >600/11\u224854.545.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 becomes:\n\n80*(41 z +120 ) / (11 z -600 ).\n\nLet me denote f(z)=80*(41 z +120 ) / (11 z -600 ), where z>600/11.\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of f(z) over z>600/11.\n\nBecause BD\u00b2 is expressed in terms of z, and we can analyze f(z) to find its minimum.\n\nSo, to find the minimal value of f(z), let's compute its derivative and find critical points.\n\nFirst, let me write f(z)=80*(41 z +120 ) / (11 z -600 ).\n\nLet me compute f'(z):\n\nf'(z)=80*[ (41)(11 z -600 ) - (41 z +120)(11) ] / (11 z -600 )\u00b2.\n\nWait, using the quotient rule: d/dz [numerator/denominator] = (num\u2019 * denominator - numerator * denom\u2019)/denominator\u00b2.\n\nSo, f'(z) =80*[ (41)(11 z -600) - (41 z +120)(11) ] / (11 z -600 )\u00b2.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n41*(11 z -600 ) -11*(41 z +120 )=41*11 z -41*600 -11*41 z -11*120.\n\nCompute term by term:\n\n41*11 z =451 z.\n\n-41*600= -24600.\n\n-11*41 z= -451 z.\n\n-11*120= -1320.\n\nSo, combining terms:\n\n451 z -24600 -451 z -1320= (451 z -451 z ) + (-24600 -1320 )= 0 -25920= -25920.\n\nSo, numerator is -25920.\n\nSo, f'(z)=80*(-25920)/(11 z -600 )\u00b2= (-80*25920)/(11 z -600 )\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me compute 80*25920.\n\n25920 *80= 25920*8*10=207360*10=2,073,600.\n\nSo, f'(z)= -2,073,600 / (11 z -600 )\u00b2.\n\nSince z>600/11\u224854.545, denominator is positive, so denominator squared is positive. So, f'(z) is negative.\n\nThus, f(z) is decreasing for z>600/11.\n\nThat means as z increases, f(z) decreases. Therefore, the minimal value of f(z) occurs as z approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but as z approaches infinity, what happens to f(z)=80*(41 z +120 )/(11 z -600 )?\n\nDividing numerator and denominator by z:\n\n=80*(41 +120/z )/(11 -600/z ).\n\nAs z approaches infinity, this tends to 80*41/11= (80*41)/11.\n\nCompute 80*41=3280.\n\n3280/11\u2248298.1818.\n\nSo, as z increases, f(z) approaches approximately 298.18.\n\nBut since f(z) is decreasing, its minimum is approached as z approaches infinity, but it never actually reaches it. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 3280/11\u2248298.18.\n\nBut wait, wait, let me double-check. Because f(z) is decreasing, the minimal value is when z is as large as possible, which is infinity, so the infimum is 3280/11.\n\nBut 3280 divided by11: 11*298= 3278, so 3280/11=298 + 2/11\u2248298.1818.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 3280/11 as z approaches infinity, but is always larger than this value.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 3280/11, but since it's approached asymptotically, BD\u00b2 can get as close as desired to 3280/11 but never less than that. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses is 3280/11.\n\nWait, but is this correct? Let me think again.\n\nWait, if f(z) is decreasing for z>600/11, then as z increases, f(z) decreases. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 3280/11, and BD\u00b2 can be any value greater than 3280/11. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would be 3280/11, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 3280/11, so 3280/11 is the lower bound.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. So, since BD\u00b2 can be as close to 3280/11 as we like but never less than that, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would be 3280/11.\n\nBut let me check if BD\u00b2 can actually attain values lower than 3280/11. Wait, no, because as z increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 3280/11 from above, since f(z) is decreasing. So, the minimal value is 3280/11, so any number less than that is not a lower bound for BD\u00b2. So, 3280/11 is the infimum.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3280/11, which is 298 and 2/11.\n\nBut let me write that as an exact fraction.\n\n3280 divided by 11: 11*298=3278, so 3280=11*298 +2, so 3280/11=298 +2/11=298.1818...\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is 3280/11.\n\nBut let me confirm with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola in terms of angle parameters.\n\nLet me consider parametrizing point A as (x, y) = (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, point B can be parametrized as (p, q)=(sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6).\n\nThen, the condition xp + yq=0 becomes:\n\nsqrt(20) sec\u03b8 * sqrt(20) sec\u03c6 + sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 * sqrt(24) tan\u03c6 =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6=0.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6=0.\n\nExpress sec\u03b8 in terms of cos\u03b8: 1/cos\u03b8, tan\u03b8 = sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n5/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) +6 (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 )=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6:\n\n5 +6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6=0.\n\nSo,\n\n6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5.\n\nSo,\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nNow, BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)=4*(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nCompute that.\n\n20 sec\u00b2\u03c6=20(1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6)=20 +20 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\n24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, 20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6=20 +20 tan\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6=20 +44 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2=4*(20 +44 tan\u00b2\u03c6 )=80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2. So, since tan\u00b2\u03c6 is non-negative, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when tan\u00b2\u03c6 is as small as possible, which is zero. But tan\u00b2\u03c6=0 implies sin\u03c6=0, but from earlier, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6=-5/6, which would require sin\u03b8 to be undefined (since sin\u03c6=0 would require sin\u03b8 to be infinite to satisfy -5/6=0, which is impossible). So, tan\u00b2\u03c6 cannot be zero. So, the minimal value is approached as tan\u00b2\u03c6 approaches its minimal positive value.\n\nBut perhaps we can express tan\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nFrom earlier, we have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6= -5/6. Let me write this as:\n\nsin\u03c6= (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nBut since |sin\u03c6| \u22641, we have |(-5)/(6 sin\u03b8)| \u22641 \u2192 |5/(6 sin\u03b8)| \u22641 \u2192 |sin\u03b8| \u22655/6.\n\nSo, |sin\u03b8| \u22655/6. Therefore, \u03b8 is such that sin\u03b8 is either \u22655/6 or \u2264-5/6.\n\nNow, let's express tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\ntan\u03c6= sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6.\n\nWe have sin\u03c6= (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nAnd cos\u00b2\u03c6=1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6=1 - (25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )= (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ).\n\nSo, cos\u03c6= \u00b1sqrt( (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ))= \u00b1sqrt(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)/(6 |sin\u03b8| ).\n\nBut we can write tan\u00b2\u03c6= sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6= [25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] / [ (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ]=25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25).\n\nSo, tan\u00b2\u03c6=25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 +176*(25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n=80 + (176*25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 )=80 +4400/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 ).\n\nLet me denote u= sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSince |sin\u03b8| \u22655/6, u \u226525/36\u22480.6944.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 +4400/(36 u -25 ).\n\nNow, we can write BD\u00b2 as a function of u:\n\nf(u)=80 +4400/(36 u -25 ), where u\u226525/36.\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of f(u) for u\u226525/36.\n\nLet me compute the derivative of f(u) with respect to u:\n\nf'(u)= -4400*36/(36 u -25 )\u00b2.\n\nSince the denominator is squared, it's positive, and 4400 and 36 are positive, so f'(u) is negative.\n\nThus, f(u) is decreasing for u\u226525/36.\n\nThus, the minimal value of f(u) is approached as u approaches infinity. Wait, but u is sin\u00b2\u03b8, which can't exceed 1. So, u can only go up to 1.\n\nSo, the domain of u is [25/36,1].\n\nSo, f(u) is decreasing on [25/36,1], so the minimal value is at u=1.\n\nCompute f(1)=80 +4400/(36*1 -25 )=80 +4400/(11 )=80 +400=480.\n\nWait, that contradicts the earlier result. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, in the first approach, when parametrizing in terms of y\u00b2, we found BD\u00b2 approaches 3280/11\u2248298.18 as y\u00b2 approaches infinity. But in this second approach, parametrizing in terms of \u03b8, we find that BD\u00b2 approaches 480 when u approaches 1, but is decreasing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach.\n\nWait, in the first approach, as y\u00b2 approaches infinity, z approaches infinity, and BD\u00b2 approaches 3280/11\u2248298.18. But in the second approach, when u approaches 1, which would correspond to sin\u03b8 approaching 1 or -1, which would mean that point A is approaching the vertex of the hyperbola? Wait, no, the hyperbola extends to infinity, so perhaps when sin\u03b8 approaches 1, point A approaches the vertical asymptote? Hmm, perhaps the two approaches are considering different limits.\n\nWait, perhaps the first approach is considering points A and B moving towards infinity along the hyperbola, while in the second approach, point A is moving towards a specific direction where sin\u03b8 approaches 1, but that would make point A's y-coordinate go to infinity as well, but perhaps in a different scaling.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made an error in the first approach.\n\nWait, in the first approach, BD\u00b2 approached 3280/11\u2248298.18 as y\u00b2\u2192infty, but in the second approach, BD\u00b2 approached 480 as u\u21921.\n\nBut 3280/11 is approximately 298, which is less than 480. So, which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn the second approach, we have BD\u00b2=80 +4400/(36 u -25 ), with u= sin\u00b2\u03b8 \u226525/36.\n\nSo, when u=25/36, we have denominator 36*(25/36) -25=25-25=0. So, at u=25/36, the expression 4400/(36 u -25 ) becomes 4400/0, which is undefined. So, as u approaches 25/36 from above, 36u -25 approaches zero from above, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWhen u=1, BD\u00b2=80 +4400/(36*1 -25 )=80 +4400/11=80 +400=480.\n\nAnd since f(u) is decreasing on [25/36,1], then the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, and the maximum is infinity.\n\nWait, that contradicts the first approach where BD\u00b2 approached 298 as y\u00b2\u2192infty.\n\nSo, which approach is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps in the second approach, I fixed points A and B using the same parameter \u03b8 and \u03c6, but perhaps there's a relation between \u03b8 and \u03c6 that I didn't correctly account for.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nIn the second approach, we had sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 =-5/6.\n\nSo, if \u03b8 approaches pi/2, sin\u03b8 approaches 1, so sin\u03c6 approaches -5/6, which is a fixed value. So, as \u03b8 approaches pi/2, sin\u03c6 approaches -5/6, so phi approaches arcsin(-5/6). So, point B approaches a fixed point on the hyperbola, not at infinity.\n\nWait, so in this case, as \u03b8 approaches pi/2, point A approaches (sqrt(20) sec(pi/2), sqrt(24) tan(pi/2)), but wait, sec(pi/2) and tan(pi/2) are undefined, approaching infinity. So, point A approaches infinity along the hyperbola.\n\nBut point B approaches (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6), with sin\u03c6=-5/6.\n\nSo, sec\u03c6=1/cos\u03c6, cos\u03c6=sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6)=sqrt(1 -25/36)=sqrt(11/36)=sqrt(11)/6.\n\nSo, sec\u03c6=6/sqrt(11), and tan\u03c6= sin\u03c6/cos\u03c6= (-5/6)/(sqrt(11)/6 )= -5/sqrt(11).\n\nSo, point B approaches (sqrt(20)*(6/sqrt(11)), sqrt(24)*(-5/sqrt(11)) ).\n\nSo, coordinates:\n\np= sqrt(20)*(6/sqrt(11))= (6 sqrt(20))/sqrt(11)= (6*2 sqrt(5))/sqrt(11)=12 sqrt(5/11).\n\nq= sqrt(24)*(-5/sqrt(11))= (2 sqrt(6))*(-5/sqrt(11))= -10 sqrt(6/11).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)=4*( (144*5)/11 + (100*6)/11 )=4*(720/11 +600/11)=4*(1320/11 )=5280/11\u2248480.\n\nWhich matches the earlier result.\n\nBut in the first approach, as y\u00b2 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 3280/11\u2248298.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps in the first approach, I considered points A and B moving in a way that y\u00b2 approaches infinity, but in the second approach, I considered point A approaching infinity along a specific direction where BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nTherefore, perhaps BD\u00b2 can take values from a lower limit up to infinity, but in the first approach, I found that as y\u00b2 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 298, which is less than 480.\n\nBut that suggests that BD\u00b2 can get as low as 298, but in the second approach, when moving point A towards a specific direction, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut this suggests that perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is 298, and the maximum is infinity, but in the second approach, we have BD\u00b2 approaching 480 as point A approaches a certain direction.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is 3280/11\u2248298.18, and the other approach was not considering the minimal case.\n\nWait, perhaps in the second approach, when I set u=1, that's the minimal u, but in reality, u can be larger, but in the second approach, u is limited to [25/36,1], because sin\u00b2\u03b8 can't exceed 1.\n\nWait, but in reality, u can be larger than 1 because hyperbola extends to infinity, but in the parametrization x= sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, y= sqrt(24) tan\u03b8, \u03b8 is such that sec\u03b8 and tan\u03b8 are defined, which is \u03b8 \u2260pi/2 +k pi. So, sin\u03b8 can be any real number, but in this parametrization, sin\u03b8 is bounded between -1 and 1, because \u03b8 is a real parameter. So, perhaps this parametrization doesn't cover all points on the hyperbola, only those where sin\u03b8 is between -1 and 1.\n\nTherefore, in this parametrization, u=sin\u00b2\u03b8 can only go up to 1, so BD\u00b2 can only go down to 480. But in reality, the hyperbola has points where y\u00b2 can be any number greater than or equal to 24*(1 +x\u00b2/20 ), which can go to infinity. So, perhaps the first approach is correct in allowing y\u00b2 to go to infinity, leading BD\u00b2 to approach 298.18.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is 3280/11, which is approximately 298.18, and that's the infimum.\n\nThus, the answer is 3280/11.\n\nWait, but let me check this with another approach.\n\nLet me consider parametrizing points A and B such that they are reflections over the origin, with diagonals perpendicular.\n\nWait, another thought: for a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, if the diagonals are AC and BD, then the area of the rhombus is (AC * BD)/2.\n\nBut perhaps we can express the area in terms of the hyperbola.\n\nAlternatively, since points A and C are on the hyperbola, and B and D are also on the hyperbola, perhaps we can find a relation between the coordinates.\n\nWait, but I think the first approach is correct in allowing BD\u00b2 to approach 3280/11 as y\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, in that case, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 3280/11, and the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses is 3280/11.\n\nWait, but 3280 divided by 11 is exactly 298.1818...\n\nSo, 3280/11 is the minimal value of BD\u00b2, so the answer is 3280/11.\n\nThus, the answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{3280}{11}}.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus \\(ABCD\\) on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals are perpendicular, leading to the condition \\(xp + yq = 0\\) for points \\(A(x, y)\\) and \\(B(p, q)\\). \n\nWe express \\(BD^2\\) as \\(4(p^2 + q^2)\\) and find its minimal value. By parameterizing the points and analyzing the function, we find that \\(BD^2\\) approaches \\(\\frac{3280}{11}\\) as \\(y^2\\) approaches infinity. Thus, the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombuses is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{3280}{11}}\n\\]",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, and ABCD is a rhombus. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, right? Or maybe the minimum value BD\u00b2 can take, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nFirst, let's recall some properties. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case, they are. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's an important property.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, the diagonals are symmetric about the origin.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, points A, B, C, D can be thought of as being in pairs symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis, but maybe not necessarily. Wait, no. Because the diagonals intersect at the origin, so if point A is (x,y), then point C must be (-x,-y), because the diagonal AC passes through the origin. Similarly, the other diagonal BD must also pass through the origin. So, if point B is (p,q), then point D must be (-p,-q). So, the four points are A, B, C = -A, D = -B.\n\nSo, all four points lie on the hyperbola, so substituting each into the equation, we have for point A: (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1, and similarly for point B: (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B must be equal to the distance between B and C, etc. Let's write that down.\n\nDistance AB squared is (x - p)\u00b2 + (y - q)\u00b2.\n\nDistance BC squared is (p - (-x))\u00b2 + (q - (-y))\u00b2, which is (p + x)\u00b2 + (q + y)\u00b2.\n\nSince AB = BC, their squares must be equal:\n\n(x - p)\u00b2 + (y - q)\u00b2 = (x + p)\u00b2 + (y + q)\u00b2.\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: x\u00b2 - 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2yq + q\u00b2.\n\nRight side: x\u00b2 + 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yq + q\u00b2.\n\nSubtract left side from right side:\n\n[ x\u00b2 + 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yq + q\u00b2 ] - [ x\u00b2 - 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2yq + q\u00b2 ] = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n4xp + 4yq = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nxp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, this is a condition that points A(x,y) and B(p,q) must satisfy.\n\nSimilarly, because the sides are equal, all other consecutive sides must satisfy similar conditions, but since we have a rhombus, this condition should be sufficient. Alternatively, maybe I should also set AB squared equal to AD squared, but let's see.\n\nWait, point D is (-p, -q), so the distance from A to D is sqrt[ (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2 ], which we already considered in BC. So, perhaps the condition AB = BC is enough.\n\nSo, the condition is xp + yq = 0.\n\nAdditionally, since diagonals in a rhombus are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. Let me check if that's correct. Yes, because if two lines are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1.\n\nWait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the slopes of the diagonals AC and BD must satisfy (slope_AC)*(slope_BD) = -1.\n\nSlope of AC: since A is (x,y) and C is (-x, -y), the line AC goes from (x,y) to (-x,-y). The slope is ( -y - y ) / ( -x - x ) = (-2y)/(-2x) = y/x.\n\nSimilarly, the slope of BD: points B(p, q) and D(-p, -q). So, slope is ( -q - q ) / ( -p - p ) = (-2q)/(-2p) = q/p.\n\nSo, slope_AC * slope_BD = (y/x)*(q/p) = (y q)/(x p). But we already have from the condition xp + yq = 0, so y q = -x p. So, (y q)/(x p) = (-x p)/(x p) = -1. So, that condition is satisfied. So, the diagonals are indeed perpendicular, which is consistent with the rhombus property.\n\nSo, that's a good check.\n\nSo, now, our main conditions are:\n\n1. A(x,y) and B(p,q) lie on the hyperbola: (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1 and (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\n2. xp + yq = 0.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD. Since BD goes from (p,q) to (-p,-q), its length is sqrt[(p - (-p))\u00b2 + (q - (-q))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2p)^2 + (2q)^2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 = (2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), given the constraints.\n\nOur goal is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. That is, find the infimum of BD\u00b2, which would be the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2. So, essentially, find the minimum value of 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) subject to the conditions:\n\n1. (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\n2. (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\n3. xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, we need to minimize 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) given these constraints.\n\nAlternatively, since we can scale variables, perhaps we can express variables in terms of each other.\n\nLet me see. We have xp + yq =0. So, perhaps we can express y in terms of x, and q in terms of p, or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps parametrize the points A and B on the hyperbola. For hyperbola parametrization, one common way is to use hyperbolic functions, but maybe a better approach is to use coordinates with parameters. Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize points A and B such that they are related through the condition xp + yq =0.\n\nWait, let me think of points on the hyperbola. For hyperbola (x\u00b2)/a\u00b2 - (y\u00b2)/b\u00b2 =1, a parameterization can be x = a sec\u03b8, y = b tan\u03b8, or x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t, but perhaps using trigonometric functions would complicate things because hyperbola isn't periodic. Alternatively, maybe we can set x = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, y = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8, so that (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = sec\u00b2\u03b8 - tan\u00b2\u03b8 =1, which satisfies the equation.\n\nSo, let's parameterize point A as (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8). Similarly, point B can be parameterized as (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6). Then, their coordinates are (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8) and (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6).\n\nThen, the condition xp + yq =0 becomes:\n\nsqrt(20) sec\u03b8 * sqrt(20) sec\u03c6 + sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 * sqrt(24) tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0.\n\nHmm, that seems manageable. So, 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0.\n\nLet me divide both sides by sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6:\n\n20 + 24 (sin\u03b8 / cos\u03b8)(sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6) * (cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) ) = 0.\n\nWait, no, let me think differently. Let's write tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 as (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6). So, the equation is:\n\n20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 24 (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) =0.\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n20/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) + 24 (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) =0.\n\nFactor out 1/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6):\n\n[20 + 24 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6]/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) =0.\n\nSince 1/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) is never zero (unless cos\u03b8 or cos\u03c6 is infinite, which it's not), we can set numerator to zero:\n\n20 +24 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6=0.\n\nSo,\n\n24 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -20.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5.\n\nSo,\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, that's a key equation.\n\nSo, we have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nNow, our aim is to find BD\u00b2, which is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Point B is (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6). So, p = sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, q = sqrt(24) tan\u03c6.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nExpress this in terms of sin\u03c6 and cos\u03c6:\n\nsec\u00b2\u03c6 = 1/cos\u00b2\u03c6, tan\u00b2\u03c6 = sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20 / cos\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 (sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6) = [20 +24 sin\u00b2\u03c6]/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) =4*[20 +24 sin\u00b2\u03c6]/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4*(20 +24 sin\u00b2\u03c6)/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut we need to express this in terms of a single variable, perhaps, using the relation sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nHmm. Since we have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, perhaps we can find a relation between \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nLet me denote sin\u03b8 = s, sin\u03c6 = t. So, s t = -5/6.\n\nBut we also have to relate cos\u03b8 and cos\u03c6. Alternatively, perhaps we can express cos\u00b2\u03b8 and cos\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03b8 and sin\u03c6, but that might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the identity cos\u00b2\u03c6 =1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6, but that might not help directly.\n\nWait, maybe we can consider that BD\u00b2 is expressed in terms of sin\u03c6 and cos\u03c6, but we have a relation between sin\u03b8 and sin\u03c6.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps we can set up another variable substitution.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that since the rhombus is determined by points A and B, and the condition is sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, perhaps we can let sin\u03b8 = k, sin\u03c6 = -5/(6k), but then we have to ensure that |k| <=1 and |-5/(6k)| <=1. So, |k| >=5/6.\n\nWait, because |sin\u03c6| = | -5/(6k)| = 5/(6|k|). So, for |sin\u03c6| <=1, we have 5/(6|k|) <=1 => |k| >=5/6.\n\nSo, |k| >=5/6, so |sin\u03b8| >=5/6. So, \u03b8 is in regions where sin\u03b8 is at least 5/6 or less than or equal to -5/6.\n\nSo, that gives a constraint on \u03b8.\n\nNow, let's go back to BD\u00b2.\n\nBD\u00b2 =4*(20 +24 sin\u00b2\u03c6)/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut sin\u03c6 = -5/(6 sin\u03b8), as per sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, sin\u03c6 = -5/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nSo, let's compute sin\u00b2\u03c6 = (25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4*(20 +24*(25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8))/cos\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nWait, let me compute the numerator inside:\n\n20 +24 sin\u00b2\u03c6 =20 +24*(25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) =20 + (24*25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) =20 + (600)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) =20 + (50)/(3 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4*(20 +50/(3 sin\u00b2\u03b8))/cos\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated, but perhaps we can express everything in terms of sin\u03b8.\n\nBut we also know that cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo, substitute that in:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4*(20 +50/(3 sin\u00b2\u03b8))/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4*(20 + (50)/(3 sin\u00b2\u03b8)) / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nLet me denote t = sin\u00b2\u03b8. Since |sin\u03b8| >=5/6, t >=25/36.\n\nSo, t >=25/36.\n\nSo, substituting t:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4*(20 +50/(3 t))/(1 - t).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4*( (20 t +50/3 ) / t ) / (1 - t).\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n20t +50/3 = (60t +50)/3.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4*( (60t +50)/3 ) / (t (1 - t)).\n\nWhich is:\n\nBD\u00b2 = (4/3)*(60t +50)/(t(1 - t)).\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n60t +50 =10*(6t +5).\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = (4/3)*10*(6t +5)/(t(1 - t)) = (40/3)*(6t +5)/(t(1 - t)).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (40/3)*(6t +5)/(t(1 - t)).\n\nWe need to minimize BD\u00b2 with respect to t, where t >=25/36.\n\nSo, let me define f(t) = (6t +5)/(t(1 - t)).\n\nWe need to find the minimum of f(t) for t >=25/36.\n\nWait, but 25/36 is approximately 0.6944. Let me compute 1 - t: for t >=25/36, 1 - t <= 11/36 ~0.3056.\n\nSo, let me compute f(t) = (6t +5)/(t(1 - t)).\n\nLet me see if I can find the minimum of f(t). Let's compute the derivative of f(t) with respect to t.\n\nFirst, let me write f(t) as (6t +5)/(t(1 - t)) = (6t +5)/(t - t\u00b2).\n\nCompute f'(t):\n\nUsing the quotient rule: if f(t) = N/D, then f'(t) = (N' D - N D')/D\u00b2.\n\nHere, N =6t +5, N' =6.\n\nD =t - t\u00b2, D' =1 -2t.\n\nSo,\n\nf'(t) = [6*(t - t\u00b2) - (6t +5)*(1 -2t)] / (t - t\u00b2)^2.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nFirst term:6(t - t\u00b2) =6t -6t\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: (6t +5)(1 -2t) =6t*(1) +6t*(-2t) +5*(1) +5*(-2t) =6t -12t\u00b2 +5 -10t = (-4t) -12t\u00b2 +5.\n\nSo, the numerator is [6t -6t\u00b2] - [ (-4t -12t\u00b2 +5) ].\n\nWait, no, the numerator is N'*D - N*D' = [6*(t - t\u00b2)] - [ (6t +5)*(1 -2t) ].\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in expanding. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, (6t +5)(1 -2t) =6t*(1) +6t*(-2t) +5*(1) +5*(-2t) =6t -12t\u00b2 +5 -10t = (6t -10t) + (-12t\u00b2) +5 = (-4t) -12t\u00b2 +5.\n\nSo, numerator is:\n\n6(t - t\u00b2) - [ -4t -12t\u00b2 +5 ].\n\nWhich is:\n\n6t -6t\u00b2 +4t +12t\u00b2 -5.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(6t +4t) + (-6t\u00b2 +12t\u00b2) + (-5) =10t +6t\u00b2 -5.\n\nSo, numerator is 6t\u00b2 +10t -5.\n\nSo, f'(t) = (6t\u00b2 +10t -5)/(t - t\u00b2)^2.\n\nWe need to find critical points where f'(t)=0.\n\nSet numerator equal to zero:\n\n6t\u00b2 +10t -5 =0.\n\nSolve for t:\n\nt = [ -10 \u00b1 sqrt(100 + 120) ] / (2*6) = [ -10 \u00b1 sqrt(220) ] /12.\n\nSimplify sqrt(220) = sqrt(4*55) =2 sqrt(55) \u224814.832.\n\nSo,\n\nt = [ -10 \u00b114.832 ] /12.\n\nSo, two solutions:\n\nt1 = ( -10 +14.832 ) /12 \u22484.832/12 \u22480.4027.\n\nt2= ( -10 -14.832 ) /12 \u2248-24.832/12\u2248-2.069. Disregard negative t, since t is sin\u00b2\u03b8 >=0.\n\nSo, the critical point is at t\u22480.4027. But wait, our domain is t >=25/36\u22480.6944. So, 0.4027 is less than 25/36, which is our lower bound. So, in our domain t >=25/36, the function f(t) has its derivative f'(t) evaluated at t=25/36. Let's compute f'(25/36):\n\nf'(t) = (6t\u00b2 +10t -5)/(t - t\u00b2)^2.\n\nCompute numerator at t=25/36:\n\n6*(25/36)^2 +10*(25/36) -5.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n6*(625/1296) =3750/1296 \u22482.8935.\n\n10*(25/36)=250/36\u22486.9444.\n\nSo, numerator: 3750/1296 +250/36 -5.\n\nConvert all to 1296 denominator:\n\n3750/1296 + (250/36)*(36/36)= 250*36/1296=9000/1296.\n\nSo, 3750 +9000 =12750/1296.\n\nSubtract 5*(1296/1296)=6480/1296.\n\nSo, numerator: (12750 -6480)/1296 =6270/1296\u22484.839.\n\nDenominator: (t - t\u00b2)^2.\n\nCompute t -t\u00b2 at t=25/36:\n\nt -t\u00b2=25/36 - (25/36)^2 =25/36*(1 -25/36)=25/36*(11/36)=275/1296.\n\nSo, denominator is (275/1296)^2\u2248(0.2121)^2\u22480.045.\n\nSo, f'(25/36)\u22484.839 /0.045\u2248107.53, which is positive.\n\nSince the derivative is positive at t=25/36, and since there are no critical points in t >=25/36, the function f(t) is increasing for t >=25/36. Therefore, the minimum of f(t) occurs at t=25/36.\n\nTherefore, the minimum BD\u00b2 is (40/3)*f(25/36).\n\nCompute f(25/36):\n\nf(t) = (6t +5)/(t(1 -t)).\n\nCompute numerator:6*(25/36) +5 = (150/36) +5 = (25/6) +5= (25 +30)/6=55/6\u22489.1667.\n\nDenominator: t*(1 -t)=25/36*(1 -25/36)=25/36*(11/36)=275/1296\u22480.212.\n\nSo, f(25/36)= (55/6)/(275/1296)= (55/6)*(1296/275).\n\nSimplify:\n\n55 and 275: 275=5*55, so 55/275=1/5.\n\n1296/6=216.\n\nSo,\n\nf(t)= (1/5)*216=43.2.\n\nSo, f(25/36)=43.2.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2= (40/3)*43.2.\n\nCompute 43.2 *40=1728.\n\n1728/3=576.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=576.\n\nWait, that's a nice number. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 576.\n\nBut wait, let's check the calculations again because 576 seems a bit large, but perhaps it's correct.\n\nWait, let me compute f(25/36) again.\n\nNumerator:6*(25/36)+5= (150/36)+5= (25/6)+5= (25 +30)/6=55/6\u22489.1667.\n\nDenominator:25/36*(11/36)=275/(36*36)=275/1296\u22480.212.\n\nSo, f(t)= (55/6)/(275/1296)= (55/6)*(1296/275).\n\nSimplify:\n\n55 and 275: 275=5*55, so 55/275=1/5.\n\n1296/6=216.\n\nSo, f(t)= (1/5)*216=43.2.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2= (40/3)*43.2= (40 *43.2)/3= (1728)/3=576.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=576.\n\nBut wait, is this the minimum? Because f(t) is increasing for t >=25/36, so as t increases beyond 25/36, f(t) would increase, making BD\u00b2 larger. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when t is minimal, which is t=25/36.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 576.\n\nBut the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 576. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 576, but wait, 576 is the minimal value, so BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 576. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be 576. Wait, but 576 is attainable, so BD\u00b2 can be equal to 576. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be just below 576, but since 576 is attainable, perhaps the question is looking for 576 as the minimal value. Wait, maybe I misread the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's looking for the infimum, which is 576. Because BD\u00b2 can be as small as 576, but not smaller. So, 576 is the infimum. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 576 itself, but since BD\u00b2 can be equal to 576, perhaps the answer is 576.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that t can be equal to 25/36. Let me check.\n\nWe have t= sin\u00b2\u03b8 >=25/36, but when t=25/36, sin\u03b8=\u00b15/6, so \u03b8=arcsin(5/6) or \u03b8=\u03c0 -arcsin(5/6), etc. So, points A and B exist at this value, meaning BD\u00b2 can indeed reach 576. So, 576 is attainable, which is the minimal possible BD\u00b2. So, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 >=576. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 576, because BD\u00b2 can be 576. So, 576 is the minimal value, and it's attainable, so the infimum is 576.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be 576, then 576 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. It is equal for some rhombi. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 576, since BD\u00b2 is always >=576, but since 576 is attainable, that's the infimum.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, if 576 is the minimal BD\u00b2, then for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 >=576. So, 576 is the minimal value, and you can't have a number greater than 576 that is less than all BD\u00b2. So, 576 is the infimum, and the answer is 576.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). For point B, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nWait, and we have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWait, but when t=25/36, sin\u00b2\u03b8=25/36, so sin\u03b8=\u00b15/6, and sin\u03c6=\u22136/(5* sin\u03b8), which would be \u22136/(5*(5/6))= \u22136/(25/6)= \u221336/25, which is greater than 1. Wait, that can't be. So, sin\u03c6=\u221336/25, but sin\u03c6 can't exceed 1. So, that's a problem.\n\nWait, hold on, this suggests that when t=25/36, sin\u03c6 would have to be \u221336/25, which is impossible because |sin\u03c6| <=1. So, my earlier approach must have a mistake.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nWe had sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSuppose sin\u03b8 =5/6. Then sin\u03c6= -5/(6*(5/6))= -5/5= -1.\n\nSimilarly, if sin\u03b8= -5/6, then sin\u03c6= -5/(6*(-5/6))= 1.\n\nSo, sin\u03c6=\u00b11.\n\nWait, so sin\u03c6=1 or sin\u03c6=-1.\n\nSo, when t= sin\u00b2\u03b8=25/36, sin\u03b8=5/6 or -5/6, then sin\u03c6= -1 or 1.\n\nSo, let's compute BD\u00b2 in that case.\n\nWhen sin\u03c6=1, then \u03c6=\u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2.\n\nSo, point B would be at (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6).\n\nBut wait, when \u03c6=\u03c0/2, sec\u03c6=1/cos(\u03c0/2) which is undefined (infinite). Similarly for 3\u03c0/2.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that when sin\u03c6=\u00b11, point B would be at infinity, which is not acceptable because the points must lie on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, so perhaps our earlier calculation is flawed because when t=25/36, the corresponding point B would be at infinity, which is not allowed. So, maybe t cannot actually reach 25/36, but approaches it asymptotically.\n\nWait, that complicates things. So, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is not 576, but higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe it's better to consider vectors.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, we can think of points A and B as vectors, such that OA and OB are vectors, and OA + OB is a diagonal, but wait, no, because in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other. So, the midpoint of AC is the origin, and the midpoint of BD is the origin. So, if A is a vector a, then C is -a. Similarly, B is a vector b, then D is -b.\n\nIn a rhombus, the sides are equal, so |a - b| = |b + a|, since AB = BC.\n\nWait, no, in the rhombus, AB and BC are equal in length, but vectors are different.\n\nWait, let's model the rhombus in vectors.\n\nPoints: A, B, C, D. The rhombus has sides AB, BC, CD, DA.\n\nIn vectors:\n\nAB = B - A.\n\nBC = C - B = (-a) - b.\n\nCD = D - C = (-b) - (-a) = a - b.\n\nDA = A - D = a - (-b) = a + b.\n\nIn a rhombus, all these vectors have the same magnitude.\n\nSo, |B - A| = |(-a) - b| = |a + b|.\n\nWait, so |B - A| = |a + b|.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting, unless |B - A| = |a + b|.\n\nWait, perhaps not, because in reality, AB and BC are vectors, but their magnitudes are equal.\n\nSo, |B - A| = |C - B|.\n\nSo, |b - a| = |(-a) - b| = | -a -b| = |a + b|.\n\nSo, |b -a| = |a + b|.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n|b -a|\u00b2 = |a + b|\u00b2.\n\nWhich implies:\n\n(b -a)\u00b7(b -a) = (a + b)\u00b7(a + b).\n\nExpanding:\n\nb\u00b7b - 2a\u00b7b + a\u00b7a = a\u00b7a + 2a\u00b7b + b\u00b7b.\n\nSubtract a\u00b7a and b\u00b7b from both sides:\n\n-2a\u00b7b = +2a\u00b7b.\n\nSo,\n\n-2a\u00b7b = 2a\u00b7b => 4a\u00b7b=0 => a\u00b7b=0.\n\nSo, vectors a and b are perpendicular.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, the position vectors of A and B must be perpendicular.\n\nSo, OA \u22c5 OB =0.\n\nBut wait, in our earlier approach, we had a condition xp + yq =0.\n\nWhich is a\u00b7b =0.\n\nSo, our condition is that OA and OB are perpendicular vectors.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it.\n\nSo, given that points A and B are on the hyperbola, and OA perpendicular to OB.\n\nSo, problem reduces to finding points A and B on hyperbola such that OA perpendicular to OB, and BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nWe need to find the minimal BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), given that (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24=1, (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24=1, and xp + yq=0.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to model this with vectors.\n\nLet me denote vector a = (x, y), vector b=(p, q).\n\nGiven that a \u22c5 b=0.\n\nSo, a is a vector on the hyperbola (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24=1, same for b.\n\nWe have to minimize BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)=4|b|\u00b2.\n\nSo, our goal is to minimize |b|\u00b2, given that a and b are on the hyperbola and a \u22c5 b=0.\n\nSo, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers for this optimization problem.\n\nDefine function to minimize: f(b)=|b|\u00b2= p\u00b2 + q\u00b2.\n\nSubject to constraints:\n\ng(a)= (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 -1=0,\n\ng(b)= (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 -1=0,\n\nand h(a,b)=a\u22c5b= xp + yq=0.\n\nBut this seems complicated, as we have two points a and b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can look for the minimal |b|\u00b2 given that a and b lie on hyperbola and a \u22c5 b=0.\n\nAnother approach: since a and b are perpendicular, we can express b as a rotation of a by 90 degrees, but scaled appropriately.\n\nBut rotation might not preserve the hyperbola.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider parametrizing a and b such that a \u22c5 b=0.\n\nLet me consider that for a hyperbola, if a=(x,y), then b must satisfy xp + yq=0.\n\nSo, for each a, the set of b's lies on the line xp + yq=0.\n\nBut both a and b lie on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal |b|\u00b2 occurs when a and b are such that the line through the origin (since a and b are perpendicular) is tangent to the hyperbola in some way.\n\nWait, maybe another way. Let's think of a as (x, y), then b must lie on the line xp + yq=0, so q = -(xp)/y.\n\nSubstituting into the hyperbola equation for b:\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(y\u00b2 *24) =1.\n\nFactor p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2)] =1.\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 =1 / [1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2)].\n\nBut since a lies on the hyperbola, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1 => x\u00b2=20(1 + y\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, x\u00b2=20 + (20 y\u00b2)/24=20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, plug this into p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2=1/[1/20 - (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 )/(24 y\u00b2) ].\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n1/20 - [20/(24 y\u00b2) + (5 y\u00b2)/(6*24 y\u00b2) ].\n\nCompute each term:\n\n20/(24 y\u00b2)=5/(6 y\u00b2).\n\n(5 y\u00b2)/(6*24 y\u00b2)=5/(144).\n\nSo,\n\nDenominator=1/20 - [5/(6 y\u00b2) +5/144].\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2=1/[1/20 -5/(6 y\u00b2) -5/144].\n\nCombine constants:\n\nLet me find a common denominator for the constants. 1/20 -5/144.\n\nCompute 1/20=7.2/144, 5/144=5/144.\n\nSo, 7.2/144 -5/144=2.2/144=11/720.\n\nWait, 1/20 is 0.05, 5/144\u22480.034722.\n\nSo, 0.05 -0.034722\u22480.015278.\n\nWhich is approximately 11/720\u22480.015278.\n\nSo,\n\nDenominator=11/720 -5/(6 y\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2=1/[11/720 -5/(6 y\u00b2)].\n\nWe can write this as:\n\np\u00b2=1/[ (11 - (600)/(y\u00b2)) /720 ]=720/(11 -600/y\u00b2).\n\nSo, p\u00b2=720/(11 -600/y\u00b2).\n\nNow, |b|\u00b2=p\u00b2 + q\u00b2. But q= -xp/y.\n\nSo, q\u00b2= x\u00b2 p\u00b2 / y\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n|b|\u00b2= p\u00b2 + x\u00b2 p\u00b2 / y\u00b2 =p\u00b2(1 +x\u00b2/y\u00b2).\n\nWe have x\u00b2=20 +5 y\u00b2/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2/y\u00b2=20/y\u00b2 +5/6.\n\nSo,\n\n|b|\u00b2= p\u00b2*(1 +20/y\u00b2 +5/6 )= p\u00b2*(20/y\u00b2 +11/6).\n\nSubstitute p\u00b2 from earlier:\n\n|b|\u00b2= [720/(11 -600/y\u00b2)]*(20/y\u00b2 +11/6).\n\nSimplify:\n\nLet me write 20/y\u00b2 +11/6 as (120 +11 y\u00b2)/(6 y\u00b2).\n\nWait,\n\n20/y\u00b2 +11/6 = (120 +11 y\u00b2)/(6 y\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\n|b|\u00b2=720/(11 -600/y\u00b2) * (120 +11 y\u00b2)/(6 y\u00b2).\n\nSimplify:\n\n720/(11 -600/y\u00b2) * (120 +11 y\u00b2)/(6 y\u00b2) =720*(120 +11 y\u00b2)/(6 y\u00b2*(11 -600/y\u00b2)).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n720/6=120.\n\nSo,\n\n120*(120 +11 y\u00b2)/( y\u00b2*(11 -600/y\u00b2)).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by y\u00b2 to eliminate denominator:\n\n120*(120 y\u00b2 +11 y^4)/(11 y\u00b2 -600).\n\nSo,\n\n|b|\u00b2= [120*(11 y^4 +120 y\u00b2)]/(11 y\u00b2 -600).\n\nLet me factor numerator:\n\n11 y^4 +120 y\u00b2= y\u00b2(11 y\u00b2 +120).\n\nSo,\n\n|b|\u00b2=120 y\u00b2(11 y\u00b2 +120)/(11 y\u00b2 -600).\n\nLet me denote z=y\u00b2.\n\nSo, |b|\u00b2=120 z (11 z +120)/(11 z -600).\n\nNow, we have to find the minimum of this expression with respect to z.\n\nBut z must satisfy the hyperbola condition. From the hyperbola equation:\n\nx\u00b2=20 +5 z/6.\n\nAlso, since a is (x,y), and b is (p,q), with q= -xp/y.\n\nBut we also need to ensure that p is real, so denominator in p\u00b2:11 -600/y\u00b2 must not be zero, and the expression under p\u00b2 must be positive.\n\nSo,\n\n11 -600/z >0 => z>600/11\u224854.545.\n\nSo, z>54.545.\n\nSo, z>54.545.\n\nSo, our domain is z>54.545.\n\nSo, |b|\u00b2=120 z (11 z +120)/(11 z -600).\n\nWe need to minimize this expression for z>54.545.\n\nLet me denote f(z)=120 z (11 z +120)/(11 z -600).\n\nWe can compute derivative f\u2019(z) to find minima.\n\nFirst, let me write f(z) as:\n\nf(z)=120 z (11 z +120) / (11 z -600).\n\nLet me compute derivative using quotient rule.\n\nLet me denote numerator N=120 z (11 z +120)=120*(11 z\u00b2 +120 z)=1320 z\u00b2 +14400 z.\n\nDenominator D=11 z -600.\n\nSo, f(z)=N/D.\n\nThen, f\u2019(z)=(N\u2019 D - N D\u2019)/D\u00b2.\n\nCompute N\u2019=2640 z +14400.\n\nD\u2019=11.\n\nSo,\n\nf\u2019(z)= [ (2640 z +14400)(11 z -600) - (1320 z\u00b2 +14400 z)(11) ] / (11 z -600)^2.\n\nLet me compute numerator:\n\nExpand (2640 z +14400)(11 z -600):\n\n=2640 z *11 z +2640 z*(-600) +14400*11 z +14400*(-600)\n\n=29040 z\u00b2 -1,584,000 z +158,400 z -8,640,000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n29040 z\u00b2 + (-1,584,000 +158,400) z -8,640,000\n\n=29040 z\u00b2 -1,425,600 z -8,640,000.\n\nNow, compute (1320 z\u00b2 +14400 z)*11:\n\n=14,520 z\u00b2 +158,400 z.\n\nSubtract this from the previous result:\n\nNumerator = [29040 z\u00b2 -1,425,600 z -8,640,000] - [14,520 z\u00b2 +158,400 z].\n\n=29040 z\u00b2 -14,520 z\u00b2 -1,425,600 z -158,400 z -8,640,000.\n\n=14,520 z\u00b2 -1,584,000 z -8,640,000.\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n14,520 z\u00b2 -1,584,000 z -8,640,000.\n\nFactor out 120:\n\n120*(121 z\u00b2 -13,200 z -72,000).\n\nWait, 14,520 \u00f7120=121, 1,584,000 \u00f7120=13,200, 8,640,000 \u00f7120=72,000.\n\nSo,\n\nNumerator=120*(121 z\u00b2 -13,200 z -72,000).\n\nSet numerator to zero to find critical points:\n\n121 z\u00b2 -13,200 z -72,000=0.\n\nSolve for z:\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nz = [13,200 \u00b1 sqrt(13,200\u00b2 +4*121*72,000)]/(2*121).\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\nD= (13,200)^2 +4*121*72,000.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n13,200\u00b2= (1.32e4)^2=1.7424e8.\n\n4*121*72,000=4*121*7.2e4=4*121*72,000=4*8,712,000=34,848,000.\n\nSo, D=174,240,000 +34,848,000=209,088,000.\n\nsqrt(D)=sqrt(209,088,000)=approx 14,459.29.\n\nSo,\n\nz= [13,200 \u00b114,459.29]/242.\n\nCompute both roots:\n\nFirst root:13,200 +14,459.29\u224827,659.29.

Divide by 242\u2248-5.20.\n\nSince z>54.545, only first root is relevant: z\u2248114.29.\n\nSo, critical point at z\u2248114.29.\n\nNow, check behavior of f(z):\n\nAs z approaches 54.545 from above, denominator 11 z -600 approaches zero from positive side, numerator 120 z (11 z +120) approaches 120*(54.545)*(11*54.545 +120). Let me compute 11*54.545\u2248600, so 11 z +120\u2248600 +120=720. So, numerator\u2248120*54.545*720\u2248120*54.545\u22486545.4*720\u22484,700,000. Denominator approaches zero, so f(z) approaches infinity.\n\nAs z approaches infinity, f(z)=120 z (11 z)/(11 z)=120 z*(11 z)/11 z=120 z, which approaches infinity.\n\nSo, function f(z) tends to infinity as z approaches 54.545 and as z approaches infinity. So, the critical point at z\u2248114.29 is a minimum.\n\nSo, minimal |b|\u00b2 occurs at z\u2248114.29.\n\nCompute f(z) at z\u2248114.29.\n\nCompute f(z)=120 z (11 z +120)/(11 z -600).\n\nCompute denominator:11 z -600=11*114.29 -600\u22481257.2 -600\u2248657.2.\n\nCompute numerator:120*z*(11 z +120)=120*114.29*(1257.2 +120)=120*114.29*(1377.2).\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n120*114.29\u224813,714.8.\n\n1377.2\u22481377.2.\n\nSo, 13,714.8 *1377.2\u2248?\n\nLet me compute 13,714.8 *1000=13,714,800.\n\n13,714.8 *300=4,114,440.\n\n13,714.8 *77.2\u224813,714.8*70=960,036; 13,714.8*7.2\u224899,000. So total\u2248960,036 +99,000\u22481,059,036.\n\nSo total numerator\u224813,714,800 +4,114,440 +1,059,036\u224818,888,276.\n\nSo,\n\nf(z)=18,888,276 /657.2\u224828,720.\n\nSo, |b|\u00b2\u224828,720.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought BD\u00b2=4|b|\u00b2, but wait, no. BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)=4|b|\u00b2? Wait, no.\n\nWait, |b|\u00b2=p\u00b2 + q\u00b2, so BD\u00b2=4|b|\u00b2? No, because BD is the distance between (p,q) and (-p,-q), which is 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2=(2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)=4|b|\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, distance between (p,q) and (-p,-q) is sqrt[(2p)^2 + (2q)^2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2= [2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)]\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4|b|\u00b2.\n\nSo, in our case, |b|\u00b2\u224828,720, so BD\u00b2\u22484*28,720\u2248114,880.\n\nBut that's a very large number, which contradicts our earlier result of 576.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I messed up the parametrization. Let me check the earlier steps.\n\nWait, in the vector approach, we had a \u22c5 b=0, but in the Lagrange multiplier approach, we considered |b|\u00b2 as the function to minimize, but maybe we need to consider BD\u00b2=4|b|\u00b2. So, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is 4 times the minimal |b|\u00b2.\n\nWait, in the earlier calculation, when I parametrized with \u03b8 and \u03c6, I got BD\u00b2=576, but that led to an inconsistency when sin\u03c6=\u00b11, which is impossible. So, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is actually 4 times the minimal |b|\u00b2, which is 4* (something).\n\nWait, perhaps I should have considered BD\u00b2=4|b|\u00b2.\n\nWait, in the vector approach, we have BD\u00b2=4|b|\u00b2.\n\nIn the \u03b8, \u03c6 parametrization, we had BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)=4|b|\u00b2.\n\nWait, but in the \u03b8, \u03c6 approach, I think we have a mistake because when t=25/36, sin\u03c6=\u00b11, which is impossible, which suggests that the minimal BD\u00b2 is higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the vector approach and compute |b|\u00b2 as 28,720, leading to BD\u00b2=4*28,720=114,880, but that seems extremely large.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a miscalculation in the derivative.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal occurs at z=54.545, but as z approaches 54.545 from above, f(z) approaches infinity.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute f(z) at z=114.29.\n\nBut 114.29 seems too large, leading to BD\u00b2\u2248114,880, which is way larger than 576.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider parametrizing points A and B such that OA and OB are perpendicular, and both lie on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, the condition is OA \u22c5 OB=0.\n\nSo, for point A(x,y) and point B(p,q), we have xp + yq=0.\n\nAnd both points satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nWe can think of this as an optimization problem where we need to minimize |OB|\u00b2=p\u00b2 + q\u00b2, given that (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24=1 and xp + yq=0, and (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24=1.\n\nLet me use Lagrange multipliers.\n\nDefine function to minimize: f(p,q)=p\u00b2 + q\u00b2.\n\nSubject to constraints:\n\ng(p,q)=p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 -1=0,\n\nand h(x,y,p,q)=xp + yq=0.\n\nBut x and y are related to p and q via hyperbola equation.\n\nWait, but x and y are variables of point A, which is another point on hyperbola.\n\nThis is getting complicated because we have four variables: x, y, p, q.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parameterize point A as (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8), and point B as (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6), with the condition that their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, OA \u22c5 OB = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8 * sqrt(20) sec\u03c6 + sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 * sqrt(24) tan\u03c6=0.\n\nSo,\n\n20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6=0.\n\nWhich simplifies to 20/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) +24 (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6)=0.\n\nWhich is 20 +24 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6=0.\n\nSo, 24 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6= -20.\n\nWhich gives sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6= -20/24= -5/6.\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6= -5/6.\n\nSo, this is the same condition as before.\n\nBut now, we can express BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)=4*(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nWe need to express this in terms of \u03c6, considering that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6= -5/6.\n\nBut since sin\u03b8= -5/(6 sin\u03c6), we can express \u03b8 in terms of \u03c6, but it's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, express BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03c6:\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6)=4*(20/cos\u00b2\u03c6 +24 sin\u00b2\u03c6/cos\u00b2\u03c6)=4*[20 +24 sin\u00b2\u03c6]/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nWhich is what I had earlier.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(20 +24 sin\u00b2\u03c6)/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut we have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6= -5/6.\n\nSo, sin\u03b8= -5/(6 sin\u03c6).\n\nBut since sin\u03b8 must be <=1 in absolute value, | -5/(6 sin\u03c6)| <=1 => |sin\u03c6| >=5/6.\n\nSo, |sin\u03c6| >=5/6.\n\nSo, sin\u00b2\u03c6 >=25/36.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(20 +24 sin\u00b2\u03c6)/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut cos\u00b2\u03c6=1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(20 +24 sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nLet me denote t=sin\u00b2\u03c6, where t >=25/36.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(20 +24 t)/(1 - t).\n\nSo, need to minimize (20 +24 t)/(1 - t) for t>=25/36.\n\nThis is similar to earlier.\n\nCompute derivative of f(t)=(20 +24 t)/(1 - t).\n\nf\u2019(t)= [24(1 - t) - (20 +24 t)(-1) ] / (1 - t)^2.\n\n= [24 -24 t +20 +24 t ] / (1 - t)^2.\n\n= (44)/(1 - t)^2.\n\nWhich is always positive for t <1.\n\nSo, f(t) is increasing for t <1.\n\nTherefore, minimal f(t) occurs at t=25/36.\n\nSo,\n\nf(25/36)= (20 +24*(25/36))/(1 -25/36).\n\nCompute numerator:20 +24*(25/36)=20 + (600/36)=20 + (50/3)= (60 +50)/3=110/3\u224836.6667.\n\nDenominator:1 -25/36=11/36\u22480.3056.\n\nSo,\n\nf(25/36)= (110/3)/(11/36)= (110/3)*(36/11)= (110*12)/11=10*12=120.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*120=480.\n\nWait, that's different from earlier 576. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, I think in the earlier calculation, I substituted t=25/36 into BD\u00b2=4*(20 +50/(3 sin\u00b2\u03b8))/cos\u00b2\u03b8, which led to 576, but that might have been incorrect because the relationship between \u03b8 and \u03c6 was not properly considered.\n\nBut in this approach, directly substituting t=25/36 into BD\u00b2=4*(20 +24 t)/(1 - t), we get 4*120=480.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, BD\u00b2=4*(20 +24 t)/(1 - t).\n\nAt t=25/36,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(20 +24*(25/36))/(1 -25/36).\n\nCompute numerator inside:\n\n24*(25/36)= (600)/36=50/3\u224816.6667.\n\nSo,\n\n20 +50/3\u224820 +16.6667=36.6667=110/3.\n\nDenominator:1 -25/36=11/36.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(110/3)/(11/36)=4*(110/3)*(36/11)=4*( (110*36)/(3*11) )=4*( (10*36)/11 )=4*(360/11)=1440/11\u2248130.909.\n\nWait, that contradicts the previous step.\n\nWait, no, wait.\n\nWait, (110/3)/(11/36)= (110/3)*(36/11)= (110*36)/(3*11)= (10*36)/11=360/11\u224832.727.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(360/11)=1440/11\u2248130.909.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought f(t)= (20 +24 t)/(1 - t)=120, so BD\u00b2=480.\n\nWait, no, no, I think I messed up the substitution.\n\nWait, let's compute f(t)=(20 +24 t)/(1 - t).\n\nAt t=25/36,\n\n20 +24*(25/36)=20 + (600/36)=20 + (50/3)=approx 20 +16.6667=36.6667=110/3.\n\nDenominator:1 -25/36=11/36.\n\nSo,\n\nf(t)= (110/3)/(11/36)= (110/3)*(36/11)= (110*36)/(3*11)= (10*36)/11=360/11\u224832.727.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*f(t)=4*(360/11)=1440/11\u2248130.909.\n\nWait, so why did I get 480 earlier? Because I thought f(t)=120, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct BD\u00b2 at t=25/36 is 1440/11\u2248130.909.\n\nBut wait, how does this reconcile with the vector approach where we found a minimal BD\u00b2\u2248114,880?\n\nIt doesn't, which suggests that somewhere, there is a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parametrization is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps when I used the Lagrange multipliers, I messed up.\n\nWait, in the vector approach, BD\u00b2=4|b|\u00b2, where |b|\u00b2= p\u00b2 + q\u00b2.\n\nBut in the \u03b8, \u03c6 parametrization, BD\u00b2=4*(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nWait, but when we compute it, it's different.\n\nWait, let's take a step back.\n\nWe have BD\u00b2=4*(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nWe have p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2=20(1 + q\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=20 + (20 q\u00b2)/24 + q\u00b2=20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6 + q\u00b2=20 + (11 q\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(20 + (11 q\u00b2)/6).\n\nBut from the condition xp + yq=0, and points on hyperbola.\n\nBut I think this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, but I'm getting conflicting results.\n\nWait, going back to the \u03b8, \u03c6 approach.\n\nWe had BD\u00b2=4*(20 +24 sin\u00b2\u03c6)/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6= -5/6.\n\nSo, sin\u03b8= -5/(6 sin\u03c6).\n\nBut sin\u03b8 must be <=1 in absolute value, so |sin\u03c6| >=5/6.\n\nSo, let me write BD\u00b2=4*(20 +24 sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(20 +24 t)/(1 - t), where t=sin\u00b2\u03c6 >=25/36.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(20 +24 t)/(1 - t).\n\nLet me compute derivative of BD\u00b2 with respect to t:\n\nd(BD\u00b2)/dt=4*[24(1 - t) - (20 +24 t)(-1)]/(1 - t)^2.\n\n=4*[24 -24 t +20 +24 t]/(1 - t)^2.\n\n=4*(44)/(1 - t)^2.\n\nWhich is positive for all t <1.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 is increasing with t. So, minimal BD\u00b2 occurs at minimal t=25/36.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(20 +24*(25/36))/(1 -25/36).\n\nCompute numerator inside:\n\n24*(25/36)= (600)/36=50/3.\n\nSo,\n\n20 +50/3= (60 +50)/3=110/3.\n\nDenominator:1 -25/36=11/36.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(110/3)/(11/36)=4*(110/3)*(36/11)=4*( (110*36)/(3*11) )=4*( (10*36)/11 )=4*(360/11)=1440/11\u2248130.909.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2\u2248130.909.\n\nBut this contradicts the earlier result from the vector approach, which suggested BD\u00b2\u2248114,880.\n\nI must have made a mistake in the vector approach.\n\nWait, in the vector approach, I considered |b|\u00b2=p\u00b2 + q\u00b2, and then computed BD\u00b2=4|b|\u00b2.\n\nBut in the \u03b8, \u03c6 approach, BD\u00b2=4*(20 +24 sin\u00b2\u03c6)/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, perhaps the two approaches are consistent?\n\nWait, let me compute |b|\u00b2.\n\nFrom the hyperbola equation, p\u00b2=20(1 + q\u00b2/24).\n\nSo,\n\n|b|\u00b2=p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=20(1 + q\u00b2/24) + q\u00b2=20 +20 q\u00b2/24 + q\u00b2=20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6 + q\u00b2=20 + (11 q\u00b2)/6.\n\nBut from the condition xp + yq=0, and points on hyperbola.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, but I need to reconcile this.\n\nWait, in the \u03b8, \u03c6 approach, we get BD\u00b2=1440/11\u2248130.909, but in the vector approach, we get 480.\n\nBut 1440/11\u2248130.909 is approximately 130.909, which is less than 480.\n\nBut in the vector approach, when we minimized |b|\u00b2, we found |b|\u00b2\u224828,720, which would make BD\u00b2\u2248114,880, which is way larger.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because in the \u03b8, \u03c6 approach, we have a specific parametrization, but in the vector approach, we considered a different relationship.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the \u03b8, \u03c6 approach.\n\nWait, let's compute BD\u00b2=4*(20 +24 t)/(1 - t) at t=25/36.\n\nAs above, BD\u00b2=1440/11\u2248130.909.\n\nBut let's compute BD\u00b2 as per the vector approach.\n\nWait, in the vector approach, we set up f(z)=120 z (11 z +120)/(11 z -600).\n\nWe found the minimal at z\u2248114.29, with f(z)=28,720, so BD\u00b2=4*28,720=114,880.\n\nBut this is inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the vector approach.\n\nWait, in the vector approach, we considered |b|\u00b2= p\u00b2 + q\u00b2.\n\nBut in the \u03b8, \u03c6 approach, BD\u00b2=4*(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, if BD\u00b2=480, then |b|\u00b2=120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a miscalculation in the vector approach.\n\nWait, let me check the vector approach again.\n\nWe had:\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nBut we can write this as:\n\n4*(20/cos\u00b2\u03c6 +24 sin\u00b2\u03c6/cos\u00b2\u03c6)=4*(20 +24 sin\u00b2\u03c6)/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nWhich is same as in the \u03b8, \u03c6 approach.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(20 +24 sin\u00b2\u03c6)/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut in the vector approach, I tried to express everything in terms of z=y\u00b2, which might have complicated things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should stick with the \u03b8, \u03c6 approach.\n\nSince in the \u03b8, \u03c6 approach, we have BD\u00b2=1440/11\u2248130.909, which is approximately 130.909.\n\nBut 1440/11 is exactly 130.9090909...\n\nBut 1440/11=130 +10/11\u2248130.909.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=1440/11.\n\nBut let me compute 1440/11:\n\n11*130=1430, 1440-1430=10, so 130 +10/11=130.9090909...\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=1440/11.\n\nBut wait, in that case, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 1440/11, which is about 130.909.\n\nBut earlier, in the parametrization where I got BD\u00b2=576, I think that was incorrect because it led to sin\u03c6=\u00b11, which is impossible.\n\nSo, the correct minimal BD\u00b2 is 1440/11.\n\nBut wait, let me check my steps again.\n\nIn the \u03b8, \u03c6 approach, with t=sin\u00b2\u03c6=25/36, we get BD\u00b2=4*(20 +24*(25/36))/(1 -25/36)=4*(20 +50/3)/(11/36)=4*(110/3)/(11/36)=4*(110/3)*(36/11)=4*( (110*36)/(3*11) )=4*( (10*36)/11 )=4*(360/11)=1440/11.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=1440/11\u2248130.909.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 1440/11.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 1440/11.\n\nBut wait, is 1440/11 the minimal BD\u00b2?\n\nYes, because as t increases beyond 25/36, BD\u00b2 increases, so the minimal BD\u00b2 is achieved when t=25/36, which is 1440/11.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1440/11.\n\nBut the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 1440/11\u2248130.909, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is approaching 1440/11 from below. But since BD\u00b2 can be equal to 1440/11, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is just below 1440/11. But since 1440/11 is attainable, the infimum is 1440/11.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 1440/11.\n\nBut let me compute 1440/11.\n\n11*130=1430, 1440-1430=10.\n\nSo, 1440/11=130 +10/11\u2248130.9090909...\n\nBut in fractional terms, 1440/11 is already in simplest form.\n\nSo, the answer is 1440/11.\n\nBut wait, let me check the problem statement again.\n\nIt says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, it's looking for the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 1440/11.\n\nThus, the answer is 1440/11.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 1440/11 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 1440/11, since BD\u00b2 cannot be less than that.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1440/11.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1440}{11}}.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all rhombi \\(ABCD\\) inscribed in the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin.\n\n1. **Hyperbola and Rhombus Properties**:\n   - The hyperbola equation is \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\).\n   - The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.\n\n2. **Parametrization of Points**:\n   - Points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) on the hyperbola can be parameterized as \\(A(\\sqrt{20} \\sec\\theta, \\sqrt{24} \\tan\\theta)\\) and \\(B(\\sqrt{20} \\sec\\phi, \\sqrt{24} \\tan\\phi)\\).\n   - The condition for perpendicularity (diagonals intersecting at the origin) gives \\(20 \\sec\\theta \\sec\\phi + 24 \\tan\\theta \\tan\\phi = 0\\), leading to \\(\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = -\\frac{5}{6}\\).\n\n3. **Expression for \\(BD^2\\)**:\n   - \\(BD^2 = 4(p^2 + q^2)\\) where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are coordinates of point \\(B\\).\n   - Substituting the parameterization, \\(BD^2 = 4 \\left(20 \\sec^2\\phi + 24 \\tan^2\\phi\\right)\\).\n\n4. **Simplifying the Expression**:\n   - Using trigonometric identities, \\(BD^2 = 4 \\left(\\frac{20 + 24 \\sin^2\\phi}{\\cos^2\\phi}\\right)\\).\n   - Let \\(t = \\sin^2\\phi\\), then \\(BD^2 = 4 \\left(\\frac{20 + 24t}{1 - t}\\right)\\).\n\n5. **Minimizing \\(BD^2\\)**:\n   - The function \\(f(t) = \\frac{20 + 24t}{1 - t}\\) is minimized when \\(t = \\frac{25}{36}\\) (since \\(|\\sin\\phi| \\geq \\frac{5}{6}\\)).\n   - Substituting \\(t = \\frac{25}{36}\\), we get \\(BD^2 = \\frac{1440}{11}\\).\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{1440}{11}}\\).",
