The key steps involve recognizing the relationship between the number of circles, their radii, and the inradius of the triangle.\n\n1. **Understanding the Arrangement**: The circles are arranged sequentially, each tangent to the next, with two circles tangent to sides \\(AB\\) and \\(BC\\). This suggests the circles are aligned along the angle bisector of angle \\(B\\).\n\n2. **Formulating the Relationship**: The number of circles \\(N\\) that can fit along the angle bisector is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   N = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{(2N - 1) \\cdot r}{\\sin(\\theta/2)} \\right\\rfloor\n   \\]\n   where \\(r\\) is the radius of the circles and \\(\\theta\\) is the angle at vertex \\(B\\).\n\n3. **Applying the Formula**:\n   - For the first case with 8 circles of radius 34:\n     \\[\n     (2 \\cdot 8 - 1) \\cdot 34 = R\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     15 \\cdot 34 = 510\n     \\]\n   - For the second case with 2024 circles of radius 1:\n     \\[\n     (2 \\cdot 2024 - 1) \\cdot 1 = R\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     4047 \\cdot 1 = 4047\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determining the Inradius**: The inradius \\(R\\) must be consistent for both cases. The larger value, 4047, accommodates both arrangements. Expressing this as a fraction, it's \\(\\frac{4047}{1}\\), leading to \\(m + n = 4047 + 1 = 4048\\).\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{4048}$"
