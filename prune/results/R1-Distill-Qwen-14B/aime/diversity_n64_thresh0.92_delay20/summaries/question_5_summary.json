Additionally, 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same manner. \n\nTo solve this, we recognize that the triangles formed by the two circle arrangements are similar. The scaling factor between the larger and smaller triangles is determined by the ratio of the total lengths along the angle bisector. For the larger triangle, the total length is \\(7 \\times 2 \\times 34 = 476\\), and for the smaller triangle, it is \\(2023 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 4046\\). The scaling factor is \\(\\frac{4046}{476} = \\frac{17}{2}\\).\n\nSince the inradius scales with the same factor, the inradius of the larger triangle is \\(\\frac{17}{2}\\). Expressing this as \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime, we have \\(m = 17\\) and \\(n = 2\\). Thus, \\(m + n = 19\\).\n\n\\boxed{19}"
