Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in the triangle ABC. The triangle is inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then AD intersects ω again at P. The sides are given: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. I need to find AP as a reduced fraction m/n and then compute m + n.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing the problem. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. That doesn't look like a right-angled triangle because 5² + 9² is 25 + 81 = 106, which isn't equal to 10²=100. So it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC.

The tangents at B and C meet at D. So, D is the ex-pole or something? Wait, no, D is the intersection of the two tangents. I remember that the intersection of two tangents from a point outside the circle lies on the polar of that point with respect to the circle. But maybe I don't need that here.

So, the tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, AD is drawn and it intersects ω again at P. So, P is the second point of intersection of AD with the circumcircle. I need to find the length AP.

I think I can use power of a point here. The power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² because DB and DC are tangents from D to ω. So, DB = DC.

Then, since D lies outside the circle, the power of D is equal to DB² = DC² = DA * DP. Because when you draw a secant from D through the circle, the product of the distances from D to the points where the secant intersects the circle is equal to the square of the tangent length.

So, if I can find DA, then DP = (DB²) / DA, and since AP = DP - DA, wait, no, AP is from A to P, and DP is the segment from D to P. But actually, AD is from A to D, and it passes through P on the way. So, the entire length from D to P is DP, but AP is from A to P. So, AP would be equal to DP minus something? Wait, no, AD is from A to D, passing through P. So, AP is the part from A to P, and PD is from P to D. So, AP is a part of AD, and PD is the other part.

So, AD = AP + PD. But from power of a point, PD * AD = DB².

Wait, no, power of a point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC² = DP * DA. So, DP * DA = DB². So, DP = DB² / DA. But I can express DA in terms of AP and PD. Because DA = AP + PD. Hmm, but I have two variables: AP and PD. However, I can express PD in terms of DA, which in turn can be expressed in terms of AP.

Alternatively, maybe I can find DA first, and then compute PD, and find AP as DA - something? Wait, no, perhaps I can express AP in terms of DA. Let me think.

Wait, let me define some variables:

Let me denote AP = x. Then PD = DP = (DB²) / DA.

But DA is the length from D to A, which is DP + AP? No, wait, AD is the segment from A to D. So, AP is part of AD, and PD is the extension beyond P. Wait, no, actually, P is the intersection
