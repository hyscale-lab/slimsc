Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. It seems a bit involved, but I'll take it step by step.

First, let me parse the problem statement carefully.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between O and (1,0), and B is on the y-axis a bit higher than halfway to (0,1), since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ is from some point P(p, 0) to Q(0, q), where p and q are positive real numbers. The length of PQ must be 1, so by the distance formula, sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. Therefore, p² + q² = 1.

So each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q), with p² + q² = 1, lying in the first quadrant.

Now, the problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, C is on AB, but it's not A or B. And for any other segment PQ in F (other than AB itself), the point C is not on PQ.

Our goal is to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express OC² as a reduced fraction p/q and find p + q.

Alright, so first, let's find the equation of line AB. Points A and B are given, so we can find the slope and the equation.

Point A is (1/2, 0) and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So the slope m of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So the equation of line AB can be written in point-slope form. Let's use point A:

y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2)
y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2)

So that's the equation of AB.

Now, we need to find a point C on AB such that C is not on any other segment PQ in F except for AB itself. So, in other words, for every other segment PQ in F, the point C is not on PQ.

So, perhaps C is a point where all other PQ segments either lie entirely above it or entirely below it, except for AB. Hmm, maybe it's a point where the segments just touch C, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is the point where the envelope of all these segments PQ touches AB. The envelope might be a curve that is tangent to all these segments.

Wait, the family F consists of all segments PQ with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis, PQ of length 1. So, each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q), with p² + q² = 1.

But actually, for each p in (0,1), q would be sqrt(1 - p²), so each PQ is the line segment between (p, 0) and (0, sqrt(1 - p²)).

Wait, but the entire segment PQ is of length 1, yes.

So, perhaps the set of all such PQ segments forms a family of lines, each with equation x/p + y/q = 1, where p² + q² =1.

But since p and q are positive, we can think of this as x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) =1 for p in (0,1).

Wait, but each PQ is a line segment, not an infinite line. So, the family F consists of these line segments PQ, each connecting (p,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p²)).

Now, we are to find a point C on AB (other than A and B) that is not on any such PQ except for AB itself.

So, perhaps C is where the envelope of these PQ segments intersects AB.

Wait, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, for each p, the envelope will touch the segment PQ at exactly one point.

If I can find the envelope of these segments PQ, then the envelope might have a point where it intersects AB, and that point would be
