Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The radius squared will be a fraction p/q, and I need to find p + q where p and q are coprime.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A rectangular box has length, width, and height, which I can denote as x, y, z. The surface area of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + zx), and the volume is xyz. The set B consists of all such boxes where surface area is 54 and volume is 23.

The smallest sphere that can contain such a box would have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a rectangular box is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, so r = d/2. Hence, r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4. So, I need to find the minimum possible value of x² + y² + z² given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Wait, but it says the smallest sphere that can contain each of the boxes. So, I need to find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B, because the sphere must contain all such boxes. So, the radius will be based on the box with the maximum space diagonal in B. So, actually, I need to maximize x² + y² + z² under the given constraints.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If I have multiple boxes with different dimensions but same surface area and volume, each will have a different space diagonal. The sphere must contain all of them, so the sphere's radius must be at least as large as the maximum space diagonal of any box in B. Therefore, to find the minimal sphere that can contain all, I need to find the maximum value of the space diagonal among all boxes in B, and then set r as half of that.

So, the problem reduces to maximizing x² + y² + z² given the constraints 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

So, the problem is an optimization problem with constraints.

Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + zx, and Q = xyz. Given that P = 54/2 = 27, and Q = 23.

We also know that x² + y² + z² = S² - 2P = S² - 54. So, to maximize x² + y² + z², we need to maximize S², since 54 is fixed.

Therefore, the problem becomes: maximize S², given that P = 27 and Q = 23, where S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + zx, Q = xyz.

So, I need to find the maximum
