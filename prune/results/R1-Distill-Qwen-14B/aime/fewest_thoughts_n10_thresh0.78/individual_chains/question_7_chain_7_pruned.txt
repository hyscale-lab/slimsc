Okay, so I've got this probability problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50-50 chance. The question is about the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer needs to be in the form of a reduced fraction m/n, and then we have to find m + n. 

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, let's understand the problem. We have a regular octagon, which means it has 8 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles equal. Each vertex is colored either red or blue randomly, each color having a 50% chance. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256, since each vertex has two choices independently.

Now, the key part is figuring out when the octagon can be rotated so that all the blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. That means, after rotation, every blue vertex should be on a spot that was previously red, and every red vertex should be on a spot that was previously blue. Wait, no, actually, the problem says that after rotation, all blue vertices are at positions where there were originally red vertices. So, perhaps I don't have to flip the colors, just move the blue ones to red positions. Hmm, let's think.

Wait, no. If the octagon is rotated, the colors move with the octagon. So, suppose we have a coloring C. We can rotate it by some number of steps (0 to 7), and then check if in the rotated coloring, every blue vertex is at a position that was red in the original coloring. Wait, but the original positions are fixed, so after rotation, the blue vertices have moved, so each blue vertex in the rotated position must have been a red vertex in the original position.

Alternatively, maybe it's that the blue vertices, after rotation, are now at the original red positions. Let me think about that.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's consider that a rotation by k steps is equivalent to shifting each vertex to the position k steps away. So, if the original coloring has some red and blue vertices, we can rotate it by some k (from 0 to 7), and then check if in the rotated version, all the blue vertices are now over red vertices in the original.

Wait, that might not be correct. Because when you rotate, the colors move with the octagon. So, if a vertex was blue, after rotation it remains blue but in a new position. So, perhaps the condition is that for the rotated coloring, every blue vertex is now in a position that was originally red. So, for each blue vertex in the rotated octagon, the corresponding original position was red.

Wait, let me think with an example. Suppose the original octagon has a blue vertex at position 1. If we rotate it by k positions, then that blue vertex moves to position (1 + k) mod 8. So, in the rotated octagon, position (1 + k) mod 8 is blue, and we need that position in the original octagon was red. So, for all blue vertices in the rotated octagon, the original color at their new positions must be red.

Wait, but wait, in the rotated version, the color at position (1 + k) mod 8 is blue if and only if position 1 was blue in the original. So, we want that for every blue position in the original, when shifted by k, the position they land on in the rotated version was originally red.

So, in other words, for each blue vertex in the original, the vertex k steps ahead must be red in the original. Because when you rotate by k, the blue vertex moves to position (i +
