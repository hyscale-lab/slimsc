Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10}. So, S has 10 numbers in total. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. 

She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. But she wins the grand prize only if all four of her numbers are exactly the ones chosen. 

The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This probability is expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, the probability we need is P(A) / P(B).

First, let's figure out P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. 

To win the grand prize, all four of her numbers must match the four randomly chosen numbers. How many ways can four numbers be chosen from S? That's the combination of 10 choose 4. The total number of possible outcomes is C(10,4). 

Jen is picking 4 specific numbers, so there's only one favorable outcome where all four match. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Let me calculate C(10,4). Remember, the combination formula is C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!). So, C(10,4) is 10! / (4!6!) = (10×9×8×7) / (4×3×2×1) = 210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Next, I need to find P(B), the probability of winning a prize, which means having at least two of her numbers matching the four chosen.

Hmm, calculating P(B) directly might be a bit tricky, so maybe it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event (i.e., not winning a prize) and subtracting that from 1. 

The complementary event is that she has fewer than two numbers matching, which means she has zero or one number matching. So, P(B) = 1 - P(zero matches) - P(one match).

Let me compute P(zero matches) first. That's the probability that none of her four numbers are chosen. The total number of ways to choose four numbers not containing any of her four is the number of ways to choose four numbers from the remaining 6 numbers in S (since S has 10, and she has 4). So, that's C(6,4). The number of favorable outcomes is C(6,4), and the total possible is C(10,4). So, P(zero matches) = C(6,4) / C(10,4).

Similarly, P(one match) is the probability that exactly one of her numbers is chosen. The number of ways this can happen is choosing 1 number from her 4 and 3 numbers from the remaining 6. So, that's C(4,1) * C(6,3). The total possible is still C(10,4), so P(one match) = [C(4,1) * C(6,3)] / C(10,4).

Let me compute these values.

First, C(6,4) is 15. C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4*20 = 80.

So, P(zero matches) = 15 / 210.

P(one match) = 80 / 210.

So, P(B) = 1 - (15 + 80)/210 = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210.

Wait, let me check that computation again.

Wait, 15 + 80 is 95. 210 - 95 is 115. So, yes, P(B) is 115/210. Let me simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5? 115 ÷ 5 is 23, 210 ÷5 is 42. So, 23/42. Hmm, 23 is a prime number, so that's the simplified form.

Wait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake. Because when I calculated P(B), I subtracted the probabilities for zero and one match, but I need to make sure that the events are correctly calculated.

Wait, let me think again. Another approach might be to calculate P(B) directly as the sum of probabilities for exactly two, three, and four matches.

So, P(B) = P(exactly 2 matches) + P(exactly 3 matches) + P(exactly 4 matches).

We know P(exactly 4 matches) is 1/210, which we've already calculated as P(A).

P(exactly 3 matches): This is the number of ways to choose 3 numbers from her 4 and 1 from the remaining 6. So, C(4,3)*C(6,1). So, that's 4 * 6 = 24. So, P(exactly 3 matches) = 24 / 210.

P(exactly 2 matches): Number of ways is C(4,2)*C(6,2). C(4,2) is 6, C(6,2) is 15. So, 6 * 15 = 90. So, P(exactly 2 matches) = 90 / 210.

So, adding these up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. So, 115/210, which is the same as before. So, that's correct.

Therefore, P(B) = 115/210. Simplify this fraction: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5, as before. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42 is the simplified form.

So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = (1/210) * (210/115) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. But let me double-check.

So, P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 115/210. So, when we divide them, the 210 cancels out, and we get 1/115.

But wait, 1/115 is the probability. So, m is 1, n is 115. Are they coprime? Yes, because 115 factors into 5 * 23, and 1 is coprime with everything. So, m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. When we're calculating conditional probability, are we considering all possible cases where she wins
