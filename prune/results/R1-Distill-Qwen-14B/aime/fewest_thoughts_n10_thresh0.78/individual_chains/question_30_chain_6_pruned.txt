Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, okay. I remember that roots of unity have some special properties, especially cyclotomic polynomials. Maybe that can help me here.

First, let me write down what I know. ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, which means ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. The product I need to compute is the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Wait, but when k=0, ω^0 is 1. So let me compute that term separately.

When k=0, the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the first term is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So the product is really from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

So now, I need to compute the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Hmm. I wonder if there's a way to factor this expression or relate it to some known polynomial.

Let me look at the expression inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can write this as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me set x = ω^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x². So that's quadratic in x. Let me see if I can factor this quadratic.

2 - 2x + x² = x² - 2x + 2. Hmmm. Let me check the discriminant: D = (-2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are complex: [2 ± sqrt(-4)]/2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i. So the quadratic factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

Wait, but x is ω^k, which is a root of unity. So, perhaps I can write 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

But then, the product over k=1 to 12 becomes the product over k=1 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). So that's [product_{k=1 to 12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [product_{k=1 to 12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].

Now, the product of (ω^k - a) for k=1 to 12 is related to the cyclotomic polynomial, right? Because the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_n(x) is the product of (x - ω^k) for k=1 to n-1, but since ω is a primitive 13th root, Φ_13(x) = product_{k=1 to 12} (x - ω^k).

So, if I let x be (1 + i), then product_{k=1 to 12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) = Φ_13(1 + i). Similarly, product_{k=1 to 12} (ω^k - (1 - i)) = Φ_13(1 - i).

Therefore, the entire product is Φ_13(1 + i) * Φ_13(1 - i). So the problem reduces to computing Φ_13(1 + i) * Φ_13(1 - i) and then taking the result modulo 1000.

Now, I need to find Φ_13(x). The 13th cyclotomic polynomial. I remember that Φ_p(x) for prime p is x^{p-1} + x^{p-2} + ... + x + 1. So Φ_13(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + ... + x + 1. Alternatively, Φ_p(x) can be written as (x^p - 1)/(x - 1) when p is prime. So Φ_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1).

So, Φ_13(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} +
