Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match.

The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize.

So, P(A|B) is the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. Since if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize, A is a subset of B. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to find P(A) and P(B).

First, let's figure out the total number of possible lottery combinations. Since 4 numbers are chosen from 10, the total number of possible sets is C(10,4). Let me compute that: 10 choose 4 is (10!)/(4!6!) = (10×9×8×7)/(4×3×2×1) = 210. So, total possible sets = 210.

Now, P(A) is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. Since there's only one such winning set (the one that exactly matches her numbers), P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, I need to find P(B), the probability that she wins a prize, which means at least two of her four numbers are chosen. So, B includes all cases where 2, 3, or 4 of her numbers are among the 4 chosen. So, we need to calculate the number of ways she can have exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 matches, and sum those up.

Alternatively, since it's sometimes easier to calculate the complement, maybe I can subtract the cases where she has fewer than 2 matches (i.e., 0 or 1 matches) from the total. Let me think which approach is better.

But since the problem is about conditional probability, perhaps it's better to compute P(B) directly.

So, let's compute the number of favorable cases for B.

Case 1: Exactly 2 of her numbers are chosen.

Case 2: Exactly 3 of her numbers are chosen.

Case 3: Exactly 4 of her numbers are chosen.

So, for exactly k matches, the number of ways is C(4,k) * C(6,4 - k). Because she has 4 numbers, and the lottery picks 4. So, if exactly k of her numbers are chosen, then the remaining (4 - k) numbers must come from the other 6 numbers not in her set.

Let me verify that. Yes, since the total numbers not chosen by her are 10 - 4 = 6. So, for each case, the number of favorable outcomes is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k).

So, let's compute each case.

Case 1: Exactly 2 matches.

Number of ways = C(4,2) * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

Case 2: Exactly 3 matches.

Number of ways = C(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

Case 3: Exactly 4 matches.

Number of ways = C(4,4) * C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

So, the total number of favorable cases for B is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Wait, let me check that:

C(4,2) is 6, C(6,2) is 15, so 6*15=90.

C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6, so 4*6=24.

C(4,4)=1, C(6,0)=1, so 1*1=1.

Adding up: 90 +24=114, plus 1 is 115. Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the total favorable for B is 115.

But wait, wait a second. The total possible is 210, so P(B) is 115 / 210. Let me simplify that: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. So, P(B) = 23/42.

And P(A) is 1/210.

But wait, earlier I thought that P(A) is 1/210 because there's only one way to match all four numbers. So, yes, that's correct.

Wait, but in the formula, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B). So, that would be (1/210) / (23/42).

Let me compute that.

First, 1/210 divided by 23/42 is equal to (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23).

Simplify 42/210: 42 divides into 210 5 times. So, 42/210 = 1/5.

So, (1/5) / 23 = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, no. Wait, (1/210) * (42/23) = (1*42)/(210*23) = 42/(210*23). Then, 42/210 is 1/5, so it's 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

So, P(A|B) = 1/115. Therefore, m=1 and n=115. Since 1 and 115 are coprime, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let's recast the problem.

The total number of possible lottery draws is C(10,4) = 210.

Number of prize-winning draws (B) is the number of draws where at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen. So, that's the same as we calculated: 115.

Number of grand prize draws (A) is 1.

Therefore, P(A|B) = 1 / 115, so m + n = 116.

But wait, let me think differently. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the number of favorable cases for B.

Wait, when the problem says "at least two of her numbers were 2 of the randomly chosen numbers," does that mean exactly two, three, or four? Yes, that's correct. So, in that case, I think the count is correct.

Wait, let's double-check the numbers.

For exactly two matches: C(4,2) * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

Exactly three: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24.

Exactly four: 1. So, 90 +24 +1=115.

So, 115 is correct.

So, P(A|B) is 1/115, so m + n = 116.

Wait, but in another approach, perhaps I should calculate the conditional probability differently.

Alternatively, thinking about the conditional probability, given that she won a prize, which is 115 draws, the number of grand prize draws is 1. So, the probability is 1/115.

Yes, that makes sense.

Therefore, the answer is 116.

But wait, another thought. Maybe I should compute the probability as a ratio of the counts.

Because in the conditional probability, given that the event B has occurred, the sample space is restricted to the cases in B, which has 115 possible outcomes, each equally likely since all draws are equally probable.

Therefore, the probability of A given B is the number of favorable outcomes for A in B divided by the total number of outcomes in B.

Since A is a subset of B (as winning the grand prize implies winning a prize), the number of favorable outcomes for A is 1. So, 1/115.

Yes, that's consistent.

Therefore, m is 1, n is 115, so m + n = 116.

So, I think that's the answer.


The probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize was won is calculated as follows:

- **Total possible lottery combinations:** \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \)
- **Number of ways to win the grand prize (A):** 1
- **Number of ways to win a prize (B):** 115 (calculated as the sum of cases with exactly 2, 3, or 4 matches)
- **Conditional probability \( P(A|B) \):** \( \frac{1}{115} \)

Thus, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \), giving \( m + n = 116 \).

\boxed{116}
