Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue, each with equal probability. The question is about the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation that moves all the blue vertices to positions that were originally red. The answer needs to be in the form of a reduced fraction m/n, and then I have to find m + n. 

Let me try to parse this step by step. First, each vertex is colored red or blue independently with a 50-50 chance. So, for each vertex, it's like flipping a fair coin—heads it's red, tails it's blue. Since there are 8 vertices, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256.

Now, the problem is about the probability that after such a coloring, there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where red vertices were originally. So, for each coloring, we need to check if there's a rotation (which could be by 0°, 45°, 90°, etc.) that maps the set of blue vertices to the set of red vertices.

Wait, actually, let's think about this: the original octagon has some red and blue vertices. When we rotate it, the colors move along with the vertices. So, we're looking for a rotation that, when applied, takes every blue vertex to a position that was originally red. So, the image of the blue set under rotation should be exactly the red set.

Hmm, but that might not be entirely accurate. Let me rephrase: the rotated octagon should have all blue vertices in positions that were red in the original. So, the rotated blue set must be a subset of the original red set. But since the original red set is fixed, we can think of it as the blue set being a subset of the red set after some rotation.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, each blue vertex is moved by the rotation to a position that was red in the original coloration. So, the image of the blue set under rotation is a subset of the original red set.

But the original red set is fixed. So, if I denote R as the set of original red vertices and B as the set of original blue vertices, I need a rotation σ such that σ(B) ⊆ R.

But since σ is a rotation, it's a permutation of the vertices. So, σ(B) is the set of vertices obtained by rotating B. So, for each vertex in B, its image under σ is in R.

But also, since σ is a rotation, which is a bijection, σ(B) must have the same size as B. So, if |B| = k, then |σ(B)| = k. So, σ(B) is a subset of R of size k.

But R has size 8 - k, since each vertex is
