Okay, so I have this probability problem about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S as well. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the four chosen. 

The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize. So, it's a conditional probability problem. The probability is given as m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

First, I need to figure out the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. That is, P(Grand Prize | Prize). 

From conditional probability, I know that P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, A is the event of winning the grand prize, and B is the event of winning a prize. But if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize, so P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, P(Grand Prize | Prize) = P(Grand Prize) / P(Prize).

So, I need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of winning the grand prize and the probability of winning any prize (which includes winning the grand prize).

Let me start with the probability of winning the grand prize. Since Jen is choosing 4 numbers, and the lottery also chooses 4 numbers, the grand prize is when all four match. 

The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is the combination C(10,4). The number of favorable outcomes for the grand prize is just 1, because there's only one set of 4 numbers that matches Jen's. So, P(Grand Prize) = 1 / C(10,4).

Wait, let me compute C(10,4). That's 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(Grand Prize) = 1/210.

Next, I need to find the probability of winning any prize, which is when at least two of Jen's numbers match the four chosen. So, that includes cases where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four numbers match. But since the grand prize is a subset of this, I can compute P(Prize) as the sum of probabilities of exactly 2, exactly 3, and exactly 4 matches.

Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to compute the complement probability and subtract from 1. The complement of winning a prize is not winning any prize, which means fewer than two matches, i.e., exactly zero or exactly one number matches. So, maybe it's easier to compute 1 - P(no prize) = 1 - [P(0 matches) + P(1 match)].

I think that might be a better approach because calculating P(0 matches) and P(1 match) might be simpler than all the cases for two, three, and four. Let's try that.

So, P(Prize) = 1 - [P(0) + P(1)], where P(k) is the probability of exactly k matches.

Let me compute P(0): the probability that none of Jen's numbers are chosen. So, the lottery picks 4 numbers, all from the remaining 6 numbers (since Jen has 4, and S has 10). So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 6 not chosen by Jen is C(6,4). Thus, P(0) = C(6,4) / C(10,4).

Similarly, P(1): the probability that exactly one of Jen's numbers is chosen. So, we need to choose 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 from the remaining 6. So, the number of favorable ways is C(4,1)*C(6,3). Therefore, P(1) = [C(4,1)*C(6,3)] / C(10,4).

Let me compute these.

First, C(6,4) is 15. So, P(0) = 15 / 210 = 1/14.

Next, C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4*20=80. Therefore, P(1) = 80 / 210 = 8/21.

Wait, let me check:

C(6,3) is 20? Let me compute that: 6! / (3! * 3!) = (6*5*4)/(3*2*1) = 20. Yes, that's correct.

So, P(0) = 15/210 = 1/14 ≈ 0.0714.

P(1) = 80/210 = 8/21 ≈ 0.38095.

So, P(no prize) = P(0) + P(1) = 15/210 + 80/210 = 95/210.

Wait, 15 + 80 = 95. So, 95/210 simplifies to 19/42. Hmm, or is 95/210 simplifying to 19/42? Let me check. 95 ÷ 5=19, 210 ÷5=42. Yes, so 19/42.

Therefore, P(Prize) = 1 - 19/42 = (42 -19)/42 = 23/42.

Wait, 42 -19 is 23? No, 42 -19 is 23. Wait, 42 -19 is 23? Yes, because 42 -20 is 22, so 42 -19 is 23. So, yes, 23/42.

But let me verify this because sometimes when computing these probabilities, it's easy to make a mistake in the combinations.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute P(Prize) directly, which is P(2) + P(3) + P(4). Let's see if that gives the same result.

Compute P(2): exactly two matches. The number of ways is C(4,2)*C(6,2). So, C(4,2) is 6, C(6,2) is 15. So, 6*15=90. So, P(2)=90/210=3/7.

Similarly, P(3): exactly three matches. C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24. So, P(3)=24/210=4/35.

P(4): exactly four matches. As we computed earlier, 1/210.

So, P(Prize)= 90 +24 +1=115 over 210. 115/210 simplifies to 23/42. Which is the same as before. So, that checks out. Good, so P(Prize)=23/42.

So, now, the probability we're looking to find is P(Grand Prize | Prize) = P(Grand Prize) / P(Prize) = (1/210) / (23/42).

Let me compute that.
