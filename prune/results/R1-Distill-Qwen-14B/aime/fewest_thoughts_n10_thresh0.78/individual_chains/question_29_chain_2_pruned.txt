Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, meaning they lie on a straight line. Also, all the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by drawing a rough sketch. I think it would help to place the rectangles in a way that their sides are aligned along the same line for some points.

First, let's note the properties of rectangles. All angles are right angles, and opposite sides are equal. So, for rectangle ABCD, AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, EF = GH = 184, and FG = EH = 17.

Given that D, E, C, F are collinear, I can imagine that these points lie on a straight line. Let's denote this line as l. So, points D and C are on this line, as well as E and F.

Also, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That means these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

Wait, let me make sure. Quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. So, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That gives us some properties to work with, like opposite angles summing to 180 degrees or the power of a point.

I think it's helpful to assign coordinates to these points to make things more concrete. Let me set up a coordinate system.

Let me assume that point D is at the origin (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC = 16, AB = 107, then point C would be at (107, 16). Because in a rectangle, moving from D to C is along the length AB and the height BC. Wait, no. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, the sides are AB and BC. So, point A is at (0, 0), then point B would be at (107, 0), point C at (107, 16), and point D at (0, 16). Wait, that can't be, because then BC would be 16, but AB is 107. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the points.

Wait, actually, in rectangle ABCD, the points are arranged in order. So, if we have rectangle ABCD, the order is A, B, C, D, with AB, BC, CD, DA as sides.

So, if I take A at (0, 0), then B would be at (AB, 0) = (107, 0). Then, since BC = 16, which is the height, point C would be at (107, 16). Then, point D would be at (0, 16). So, CD is from (107, 16) to (0, 16), which is 107 units, same as AB. So that makes sense.

Now, the other rectangle is EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, points D and C are already on line l, which is the line connecting D (0,16) and C (107,16). So line l is the horizontal line y=16.

Wait, but if D, E, C, F are collinear, and line l is y=16, that would mean points E and F are also on y=16. But rectangles EFGH must have sides EF and FG.
