Okay, so I have this problem here: there's a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Basically, I need to find the infimum of BD², which is the greatest lower bound, but the question says the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi. Hmm, so maybe I need to find the minimum value that BD² can take, and then the answer would be just below that. Or perhaps it's the supremum? Wait, maybe I should think carefully.

First, let me visualize this. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, that's a square. Actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Is that right? Let me recall: yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So that must mean that the diagonals intersect at 90 degrees, and each diagonal is cut into two equal parts by the other.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense. So the diagonals pass through the origin. So the rhombus is symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis because the origin is the midpoint.

So, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin. So point A is one vertex, C is the opposite vertex, and B and D are the other two vertices.

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal, so AB = BC = CD = DA.

Let me parameterize the points. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, let me assume that points A and C are on one diagonal, say the x-axis, and points B and D are on the other diagonal, the y-axis. Wait, but the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes, so it's possible that the diagonals are not aligned with the axes. Hmm, maybe the diagonals can be any lines through the origin, not necessarily the coordinate axes.

So, points A and C lie along one line through the origin, and points B and D lie along another line through the origin, perpendicular to the first (since the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular). So, if one diagonal is at some angle θ from the x-axis, the other diagonal will be at θ + 90 degrees.

But, since the rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, and all points lie on the hyperbola, each of these four points can be represented in terms
