Alright, so I've got this problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, okay, we've got 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which is one thing. Then, some own a diamond ring, some own golf clubs, and some own a garden spade. 

The problem says that 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. Also, everyone owns the candy hearts. So, four items in total, but the candy hearts are universal—everyone has them. 

Now, we also know that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. We need to find how many own all four. 

Wait, let me think. This sounds like a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the union of multiple sets by adding and subtracting intersections appropriately. 

But in this case, the problem gives us specific numbers about people owning exactly two or exactly three items. So perhaps I can model this using the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. 

Let me denote the sets as follows:
- Let D be the set of people who own a diamond ring.
- Let G be the set of people who own golf clubs.
- Let S be the set of people who own a garden spade.
- Let C be the set of people who own a candy heart. Since everyone owns this, C is the universal set with 900 elements.

We need to find the number of people who own all four, which is |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|. But since C is everyone, this is just |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Wait, but the problem gives the number of people who own exactly two and exactly three items. So maybe I can express the total number of elements in the union of D, G, S, and C, but since C is universal, the union is just C, which is 900. 

Alternatively, perhaps the total number of residents is the sum of all the individual sets minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the triple intersections minus the four-way intersection... but wait, inclusion-exclusion for four sets might get complicated. 

Wait, hold on. Maybe it's better to consider the total number of residents as the sum of all the single sets, minus those who have exactly two, minus those who have exactly three, plus those who have all four? Hmm, not sure. Let me think differently.

I remember that the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|.

But wait, in this case, everyone is in C, so the union is 900. So,

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|.

Wait, but that doesn't include the candy hearts because they're universal. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the problem with the concept of exactly two and exactly three. Let me recall that in such cases, the principle can be broken down.

The total number of residents is the number of people owning exactly one item, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four. But in this problem, it's given that 437 own exactly two, 234 own exactly three, and everyone owns at least one (since they all own candy hearts). So, to find the number who own all four, which is exactly four, but wait, no, the four includes the candy hearts.

Wait, no. Actually, the four items are diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. But the candy hearts are a must for everyone, so the other three are optional. So when the problem says 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf, 562 own spade, and everyone owns candy. So, the four items are the three plus candy.

But the problem gives the number who own exactly two of these things, meaning exactly two of the four, which includes the candy. Hmm, so someone could own candy and one other, or two others, etc.

Wait, but all 900 own at least one because of candy. So, the total is 900, and the people are categorized into those owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four of
