Okay, I have this complex number problem to solve. The question is asking for the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\). Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number \( z \) can be written in polar form as \( z = re^{i\theta} \), where \( r \) is the modulus (which is given as 4 here) and \( \theta \) is the argument. So, since \(|z| =4\), that means \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \).

So, substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression, let's compute each part separately.

The first part is \( (75 + 117i)z \). Substituting \( z \):

\[
(75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}
\]

I can compute \( 4(75 + 117i) \) first. Let me do that:

4 times 75 is 300, and 4 times 117 is 468. So, that becomes \( 300 + 468i \). So now, the first term is \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \).

Next, the second part of the expression is \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \). Since \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), the reciprocal is \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). So, multiplying by \(96 +144i\):

\[
\frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Again, I can compute \(96/4 =24\) and \(144/4=36\). So the second term is \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

So now, the entire expression becomes:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

I think the next step is to express these terms in terms of sine and cosine to make it easier to find the real part. Since \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

Let me write each part separately.

First term expansion:

\[
(300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta
\]

But \(i^2 = -1\), so:

\[
300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta
\]

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta\)

Imaginary part: \(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta\)

Second term expansion:

\[
(24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) =24\cos\theta -24i\sin\theta +36i\cos\theta -36i^2\sin\theta
\]

Again, \(i^2 = -1\):

\[
24\cos\theta -24i\sin\theta +36i\cos\theta +36\sin\theta
\]

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \(24\cos\theta +36\sin\theta\)

Imaginary part: \(-24\sin\theta +36\cos\theta\)

Now, adding the real parts of both terms and the imaginary parts of both terms:

The entire expression's real part is:

\[
(300\cos\theta -468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta +36\sin\theta)
\]

Which simplifies to:

\[
(300 +24)\cos\theta + (-468 +36)\sin\theta
\]
\[
324\cos\theta -432\sin\theta
\]

Similarly, the imaginary part would be:

\[
(300\sin\theta +468\cos\theta) + (-24\sin\theta +36\cos\theta)
\]
\[
(300 -24)\sin\theta + (468 +36)\cos\theta
\]
\[
276\sin\theta +504\cos\theta
\]

But since the problem is only concerned with the real part, I can focus on the real part expression:

\[
324\cos\theta -432\sin\theta
\]

So, the real part is \(324\cos\theta -432\sin\theta\). I need to find the maximum value of this expression as \(\theta\) varies. Because \(z\) can be any complex number with modulus 4, \(\theta\) can take any real value, so this is an expression that depends on \(\theta\) and we need to find its maximum.

I remember that the maximum value of \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\), but wait, in this case, the expression is \(324\cos\theta -432\sin\theta\), which is similar to \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\), but with a negative sign.

So, let me denote \(A = 324\) and \(B = -432\). Then the expression is \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\), and the maximum value is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\).

Wait, but let me make sure. The maximum of \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) is indeed \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). So, regardless of the signs, because when you square them, the signs go away.

So, plugging in the values:

\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{(324)^2 + (432)^2}
\]

Let me compute that. First, compute 324 squared and 432 squared.

324 squared: Let's see, 300^2 is 90,000, 24^2 is 576, and the cross term is 2*300*24=14,400. So:

(300 +24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 = 90,000 +14,400 +576 = 105, 000 + 14,400 is 104,400, plus 576 is 104,976.

So 324^2 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: Let's compute 400^2 = 160,000, 32^2=1,024, and cross term is 2*400*32=25,600. So:

(400+32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 +32^2 = 160,000 +25,600 +1,024 = 160,000 +25,600 is 185,600 +1,024 is 186,624.

So, 432^2=186,624.

Adding them together: 104,976 + 186,624 = let's compute:

104,976 + 186,624:

100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000

4,976 +6,624 = 11,600

So total is 280,000 +11,600 =291,600.

So, sqrt(291,600) is the maximum real part.

What is sqrt(291600)? Well, 500^2=250,000, 600^2=360,000. So it's between 500 and 600.

Let me try 540^2: 540*540.

500^2=250,000

40^2=1,600

Cross term 2*500*40=40,000.

So 540^2 = 250,000 +40,000 +1,600= 291,600.

Yes! So sqrt(291,600)=540.

So the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me just check if I applied the formula correctly.

So, the expression for the real part was \(324\cos\theta -432\sin\theta\), which is in the form \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) with a=324 and b=-432. The maximum of this is sqrt(a^2 +b^2) which is 540, as I found.

So, the answer should be 540.

But wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistake in earlier steps. Let me recap.

Original expression: \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 +144i}{z}\], with |z|=4.

Expressed z as 4e^{iθ}, then substituted, expanded both terms, separated into real and imaginary parts, computed the real part as 324 cosθ -432 sin
