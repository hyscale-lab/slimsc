Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is a point on the y-axis such that its y-coordinate is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866. So, point B is a bit less than one unit up the y-axis.

The family of segments F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant. Each segment PQ has P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, for each such segment, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), with the condition that the distance between P and Q is 1. Since P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, the distance PQ would be sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, right? So, each segment PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q), where p and q satisfy p² + q² = 1.

Wait, no, actually, the segment is of unit length. So, PQ must be exactly 1 unit long, so sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. Therefore, for each such segment, p and q lie on the unit circle, but in the first quadrant since we're dealing with the first quadrant.

So, the family F is all such segments from (p,0) to (0,q) where p² + q² = 1 and p, q > 0.

Now, the problem says that there is a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, point C is on AB, not at A or B, and it's not on any other segment from F except AB.

We need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Hmm. So, the key point is that C is on AB, and it's the only point on AB (other than A and B) that's not on any other segment from F. So, if we can find such a point C, then compute OC².

First, let me figure out the equation of line AB. Points A and B are given, so let's write the equation of line AB.

Point A is (1/2, 0), and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the slope is -sqrt(3). So, the line equation can be written in point-slope form. Let's pick point A for substitution.

Using point A (1/2, 0), the equation is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So, y = -sqrt(3) x + (sqrt(3)/2). So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, any point C on AB can be parametrized as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) where x ranges from 0 to 1/2, since that's between A and B.

Now, the point C is such that it's on AB, and it's not on any other segment from F except AB. So, for C to not lie on any other segment PQ in F, except AB, which is itself a segment in F.

Wait, AB is also a segment in F? Let me see. AB has endpoints A (1/2,0) and B (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's check if AB has length 1.

Compute the distance between A and B: sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. Oh, so AB is itself a segment in F. So, AB is in the family F.

So, when the problem says that C is on AB and does not belong to any segment from F other than AB, that means that C is not on any other PQ in F besides AB. So, we have to find a point C on AB such that for no other segment PQ in F, does C lie on PQ.

So, C cannot lie on any other PQ in F, except AB.

So, to find such a point C, perhaps we have to ensure that for all other segments PQ in F (other than AB), the point C is not on PQ.

But we need to find the unique such C on AB.

Wait, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. Because in problems where you have a family of curves, the points that are on only one member are typically on the envelope.

So, maybe the segments in F form an envelope, and the point C is where AB is tangent to this envelope. Hmm, that might be a way to approach it.

Alternatively, perhaps C is the point where AB is the only segment from F passing through C, so for all other segments PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

So, another way to think is: for point C on AB, the only segment from F that passes through C is AB itself. So, no other segment PQ in F passes through C.

So, how can we ensure that? For each point C on AB, except A and B, we need to check whether there exists another segment PQ in F that passes through C. If such a PQ exists, then C is on another segment, so it's not the point we want. We want the point where it's impossible to find another PQ in F passing through it, except AB.

Therefore, the point C is such that it's the only intersection point of AB with F among all segments in F. So, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this by considering that for each segment PQ in F, it's a line from (p,0) to (0,q), where p² + q²=1. So, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1.

So, any segment PQ can be represented by the equation x/p + y/q = 1, with p² + q² =1.

So, the family F is all lines x/p + y/q =1, where p>0, q>0, and p² + q²=1.

Now, the envelope of such a family is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point.

So, perhaps the envelope is the curve that is tangent to each PQ in F, and AB is a line that is tangent to this envelope at point C. Therefore, point C is the point of tangency between AB and the envelope of F.

So, let's compute the envelope of the family x/p + y/q =1, with p² + q²=1.

The envelope of a family of curves f(x, y, p) =0 is found by solving the system:

f(x, y, p) =0

df/dp =0

So, f(x, y, p) = x/p + y/q -1 =0.

But since q is related to p by p² + q²=1, so q = sqrt(1 - p²). But perhaps it's better to write in terms of p and q.

Wait, let's see. Let me think again.

We have f(x, y, p) = x/p + y/q -1 =0, with the constraint g(p, q)=p² + q² -1=0.

So, to compute the envelope, we can use Lagrange multipliers or parametrize in terms of a single parameter.

Alternatively, since p and q are related by p² + q²=1, perhaps we can write q in terms of p: q = sqrt(1 - p²). But since p and q are positive, we can take q = sqrt(1 - p²).

So, f(x, y, p) = x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) -1 =0.

Taking derivative with respect to p:

df/dp = -x/p² + y/( (sqrt(1 - p²))² ) * ( (1/2)(1 - p²)^(-1/2) * (2p) )) = 0.

Simplify the derivative:

df/dp = -x/p² + y/(1 - p²) * (p / sqrt(1 - p²)) )

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

First, f(x, y, p) = x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) -1.

So, df/dp is derivative with respect to p:

d/dp [x/p] = -x / p²

d/dp [ y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) ] = y * d/dp [ (1 - p²)^(-1/2) ]

= y * (-1/2)(1 - p²)^(-3/2) * (-2p)

= y * (p) / (1 - p²)^(3/2)

So, df/dp = -x/p² + y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) =0.

Therefore, the envelope is given by the solutions to the system:

x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) =1

and

-x/p² + y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) =0.

Let me write these equations as:

Equation (1): x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) =1

Equation (2): -x/p² + y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) =0

Our goal is to solve these two equations for x and y in terms of p.

From equation (2):

-x/p² + y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) =0

Let me solve for y:

y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = x/p²

Multiply both sides by (1 - p²)^(3/2):

y p = x p² / (1 - p²)^(3/2)

So,

y = x p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) * (1/p²) ? Wait, wait, let me check algebra.

Wait, equation (2): -x/p² + y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) =0

So, moving the first term to the other side:

y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = x / p²

So,

y = [x / p²] * [ (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p ]

So,

y = x (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p³

So, y = x (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p³

Now, plug this into equation (1):

x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) =1

Substitute y:

x/p + [x (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p³ ] / sqrt(1 - p²) ) =1

Simplify the second term:

[ x (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p³ ] / sqrt(1 - p²) = x (1 - p²)^(3/2 - 1/2) / p³ = x (1 - p²)^1 / p³ = x (1 - p²)/p³

So, equation (1) becomes:

x/p + x (1 - p²)/p³ =1

Factor x:

x [ 1/p + (1 - p²)/p³ ] =1

Compute the expression in the brackets:

1/p + (1 - p²)/p³ = [p² + 1 - p² ] / p³ = (1) / p³

So, equation (1) becomes:

x * (1 / p³) ) =1

Therefore, x = p³

Now, from equation (2), y = x (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p³

Since x = p³, substitute:

y = p³ * (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p³ = (1 - p²)^(3/2)

So, we have:

x = p³

y = (1 - p²)^(3/2)

So, the envelope is parametrized by p as (p³, (1 - p²)^(3/2)).

Hmm, that's an interesting parametrization. Let me see if I can write this in terms of x and y without the parameter p.

Since x = p³, so p = x^(1/3)

Then, y = (1 - p²)^(3/2) = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2)

So, y = [1 - x^(2/3)]^(3/2)

Thus, the envelope is the curve y = [1 - x^(2/3)]^(3/2)

Alternatively, we can write this as y² = [1 - x^(2/3)]^3

Expanding that, maybe.

But perhaps let's find the equation of the envelope.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the envelope's Cartesian
