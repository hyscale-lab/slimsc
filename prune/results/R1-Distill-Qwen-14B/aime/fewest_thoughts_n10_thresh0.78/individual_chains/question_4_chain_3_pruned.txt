Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 make Bob the winner if he plays optimally, regardless of Alice's moves.

Hmm, let's see. I think this is a classic combinatorial game theory problem, probably involving finding winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does, and a losing position is the opposite—the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

So, the key is to figure out for each n whether it's a winning or losing position. Since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position, then Bob can win. So I need to find all the losing positions up to 2024.

I remember that in such games, the losing positions often follow a periodic pattern. Maybe I can find a pattern by calculating the positions for smaller n and then generalize.

Let me try to compute the positions for n from 0 upwards. Let's denote P(n) as true if the position is losing (the player about to move will lose if the opponent plays optimally), and false otherwise.

Base cases:
- P(0): If there are zero tokens, the game is over. So the player who is supposed to move loses. But since the game ends when someone takes the last token, maybe P(0) is a losing position. Wait, but in our problem, the player who takes the last token wins. So if n=0, the previous player has already taken the last token and won, so the current player can't move. So n=0 is a losing position for the player about to move. So P(0) = True (losing).

Wait, actually, in standard game theory, positions where you can't make a move are losing positions, so P(0) is losing. So for n=0, the player to move loses.

n=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So P(1) = False (winning).

n=2: The player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then can take it and win. Wait, but that's not good. Wait, no—if the player takes 1 from n=2, leaving 1,
