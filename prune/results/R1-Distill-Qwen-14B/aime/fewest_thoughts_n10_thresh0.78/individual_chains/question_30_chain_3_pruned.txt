Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but I think I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^n = 1. Since ω is a 13th root of unity and ω ≠ 1, it's one of the primitive roots. So, ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which I think is Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not entirely sure how that plays into this problem yet.

The main expression I need to compute is a product: ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). So, that's multiplying 13 terms together, each term being a function of ω^k. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, ω^k will cycle through all the 13th roots as k goes from 0 to 12.

Wait, but when k=0, ω^0 = 1. So, the first term is (2 - 2*1 + 1^0*ω^{2*0})? Wait, no, the exponent is 2k, so it's ω^{2k}. So for k=0, it's ω^0 = 1. So, the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1.

So, the first term is 1. That might simplify things a bit.

So the product becomes 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). So, maybe I can ignore the k=0 term since it's 1, and focus on k=1 to 12.

Now, let me think about each term. Let me denote ω^k as ζ for simplicity. Then each term is 2 - 2ζ + ζ^2. Let's write that as ζ^2 - 2ζ + 2.

Wait, that's a quadratic in ζ: ζ^2 - 2ζ + 2. Hmm, maybe I can factor this or find a relationship with ω.

Alternatively, perhaps
