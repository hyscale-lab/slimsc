Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and try to visualize what's going on.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. The goal is to find the length of AP, which can be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime integers. Then, we need to find m + n.

Alright, let's start by drawing a rough sketch of the situation. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. Tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, connecting A to D, which intersects the circle again at P. We need to find AP.

Hmm, tangents from a common external point are equal in length. So, the tangent segments from D to ω at points B and C should be equal. That is, DB = DC. That might come in handy later.

Since we're dealing with points on a circle and tangents, I think properties related to power of a point might be useful. Let me recall: the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² (since DB is the tangent from D to ω). Similarly, DC² is also the power of D. Since DB = DC, that's consistent.

Also, since AD intersects the circle again at P, the power of point A with respect to ω is (AP)(AD). Wait, no, actually the power of point A is zero because A is on ω. Hmm, maybe I need to use other theorems.

Alternatively, maybe I can use harmonic division or something related to poles and polars, but that might be too advanced.

Wait, let's think about triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. Maybe I should first compute some key properties of triangle ABC, like its circumradius, coordinates, or angles. That might help in figuring out coordinates for points or using trigonometry.

First, let's compute the semi-perimeter of triangle ABC. That might help in computing the area using Heron's formula.

Semi-perimeter, s = (AB + BC + AC)/2 = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.

Now, area using Heron's formula: sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)] = sqrt[12(12 -5)(12 -9)(12 -10)] = sqrt[12 * 7 * 3 * 2] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] = 4*sqrt(31.5). Wait, maybe that's not the simplest form. Let me compute 504: 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 16*31 is 496, 16*31.5 is 504. Hmm, but 31.5 is 63/2. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(16 * 63/2) = 4 * sqrt(63/2) = 4 * (sqrt(126))/2 = 2*sqrt(126). Alternatively, sqrt(126) is sqrt(9*14) = 3*sqrt(14). So, area is 2*3*sqrt(14) = 6*sqrt(14). Wait, let me check that
