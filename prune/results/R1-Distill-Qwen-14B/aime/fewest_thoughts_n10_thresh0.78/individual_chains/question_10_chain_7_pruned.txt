Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. We need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm. So Alice picks a set A, and based on A, Bob makes a list of sets B. Each B is finite, nonempty, and the maximum of B is in A. The total number of such B's is 2024, and from that, we have to find the sum of elements in A.

I think the key is to figure out how the number of sets B relates to the set A. Maybe it's related to the number of subsets or something combinatorial.

Let me think about this. Suppose A has some elements. For each element a in A, how many sets B have maximum element a? Because if I can find that, I can sum over all a in A the number of such sets B, and that should give me the total number of sets Bob has, which is 2024.

So for each a in A, the number of sets B where max(B) = a is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} with any combination, because the maximum is a, and the other elements can be anything less than a, including none. Wait, no, because B has to be non-empty. But since the maximum is a, and the set is non-empty, the rest can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, including the empty set, right?

Wait, no. Wait, if B has maximum a, then B must contain a, but the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}. So for each a, the number of such B's is 2^{a−1}, because each element less than a can be either included or not. But since B must be non-empty, but since a is included, the set is non-empty. So yes, for each a, the number of B's with max a is 2^{a−1}.

Therefore, the total number of sets B that Bob lists is the sum over each a in A of 2^{a−1}. And this sum is equal to 2024.

So, mathematically, that is:

Σ_{a ∈ A} 2^{a−1} = 2024.

Our goal is to find the sum of the elements of A, Σ_{a ∈ A} a.

Hmm, so we have the sum of 2^{a−1} for each a in A equal to 2024, and we need to find the sum of a's.

So, the problem reduces to finding a set A of positive integers such that the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A is equal to 2024, and then find the sum of the elements in A.

So, the first step is to figure out what set A would satisfy the equation Σ 2^{a−1} = 2024.

I think the next step is to represent 2024 as a sum of powers of 2. Because 2^{a−1} is a power of 2, so each term in the sum is a power of 2. So, the sum would be the sum of distinct powers of 2, which relates to binary representation.

Wait, but 2^{a-1} is 2 raised to (a-1). So, if a is 1, it's 2^0=1; if a is 2, it's 2^1=2; a=3: 4; a=4:8; etc.

So the sum is of the form 2^{a1-1} + 2^{a2-1} + ... where each ai is in A.

But since it's a sum of distinct powers of 2, the only way to write 2024 as a sum of powers of 2 is through its binary representation.

Wait, let me check: 2024 in binary is what?

Let me compute the powers of 2:

2^0 = 1

2^1 = 2

2^2 =4

2^3=8

2^4=16

2^5=32

2^6=64

2^7=128

2^8=256

2^9=512

2^10=1024

2^11=2048

But 2048 is larger than 2024. So the highest power in 2024's binary is 1024.

So 2024 divided by 1024 is 1 with a remainder of 2024 - 1024 = 1000.

1000 divided by 512 is 1, remainder 1000-512=488.

488 divided by 256 is 1, remainder 488-256=232.

232 divided by 128 is 1, remainder 232-128=104.

104 divided by 64 is 1, remainder 104-64=40.

40 divided by 32 is 1, remainder 40-32=8.

8 divided by 8 is 1, remainder 0.

So adding up the powers: 1024 (2^10), 512 (2^9), 256 (2^8), 128 (2^7), 64 (2^6), 32 (2^5), 8 (2^3).

Wait, but 8 is 2^3, so is that included?

Wait, let me list the exponents:

1024 is 2^10,

512 is 2^9,

256 is 2^8,

128 is 2^7,

64 is 2^6,

32 is 2^5,

and 8 is 2^3.

Wait, but is 8 included? 2^3 is 8, so yes.

Wait, but 8 is 2^3, so that's the 8 in 2024. So the binary representation is 11111101000.

Wait, let me count the bits:

2^10: 1024

2^9: 512

2^8:256

2^7:128

2^6:64

2^5:32

2^3:8

So, adding those up: 1024 + 512 = 1536; +256 = 1792; +128=1920; +64=1984; +32=2016; +8=2024.

Yes, that adds up correctly.

So, 2024 in binary is 11111101000, which is 11 bits: positions 10,9,8,7,6,5, and 3 are 1s.

Wait, but each term in our sum for Bob's list is 2^{a-1}, so each a corresponds to 2^{a-1}.

So, for each a in A, 2^{a-1} is a term in the sum
