Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many ways I can place digits in a 2x3 grid. The conditions are that when I read the numbers left to right, their sum is 999, and when I read them top to bottom, their sum is 99. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me try to break it down.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so there are two rows and three columns. Each cell will have a digit from 0 to 9. Let me label the cells to make it clearer. Let's say the top row has cells A, B, C, and the bottom row has cells D, E, F. So the grid looks like this:

A | B | C
---------
D | E | F

Now, the first condition is that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999. That means the first number is ABC (the top row) and the second number is DEF (the bottom row). So ABC + DEF = 999.

The second condition is that the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. So the three numbers here would be AD, BE, and CF. Each of these is a two-digit number? Wait, no. Wait, top to bottom, each column is a two-digit number. So AD is the first column, BE is the second, and CF is the third. So AD + BE + CF = 99.

Wait, let me confirm: the problem says the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Each top to bottom is a column, so each column is a two-digit number. So yes, AD, BE, CF are two-digit numbers, and they sum to 99.

Wait, but hold on, the problem describes the grid as a 2x3 grid, so each column is two digits. So each column, when read top to bottom, forms a two-digit number. So the sum of these three two-digit numbers is 99.

And the two numbers formed by reading left to right are the two three-digit numbers: top row ABC and bottom row DEF. Their sum is 999.

So, our grid is:

A B C
D E F

With ABC + DEF = 999, and AD + BE + CF = 99.

Let me write down the equations:

1. ABC + DEF = 999.

2. AD + BE + CF = 99.

Each of A, B, C, D, E, F is a digit from 0 to 9.

But wait, since ABC and DEF are three-digit numbers, A and D can't be zero, right? Because otherwise, ABC would be a two-digit or one-digit number. Wait, no, actually, in the problem statement, the example has the top row as 0 0 8, so ABC would be 008, which is 8. But then DEF is 991, which is 991. So 8 + 991 = 999. So in that case, A can be zero, D can be non-zero. Similarly, in the example, the top row is 008, so ABC is 8, and DEF is 991.

So, ABC is a three-digit number but can have leading zeros, meaning A can be zero. Similarly, DEF is a three-digit number, but D can be zero? Wait, in the example, D is 9, which is non-zero. Wait, but if D is zero, DEF would be 0EF, which is a two-digit or one-digit number. Hmm, but in the example, DEF is 991, so D is 9, which is okay.

But the problem statement says "the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999". So the two numbers must be three-digit numbers, but they can have leading zeros, which effectively makes them smaller numbers. So A and D can be zero.

Wait, but if A is zero, then ABC is a two-digit or one-digit number. For example, if A is zero, B is zero, C is 8, then ABC is 008, which is 8. Similarly, if A is zero and B and C are non-zero, ABC is a two-digit number. But the sum has to be 999, which is a three-digit number. So perhaps ABC and DEF are both three-digit numbers, but they could have leading zeros. So in that case, ABC can be from 000 to 999, and DEF can be from 000 to 999, but their sum is 999.

So, ABC is a three-digit number with digits A, B, C, and DEF is a three-digit number with digits D, E, F. So, their sum is 999.

So, ABC + DEF = 999. Which implies that DEF = 999 - ABC. Since ABC is a three-digit number (possibly with leading zeros), so DEF must be equal to 999 minus ABC. So, DEF is uniquely determined once ABC is chosen.

But wait, no, because ABC is a three-digit number (with possible leading zeros), and DEF must also be a three-digit number. So, for example, if ABC is 000, then DEF would be 999. If ABC is 001, then DEF is 998, and so on, up to ABC is 999, then DEF is 000.

But wait, DEF is a three-digit number, so D can be zero as well. So, in that case, DEF can start with zero, making it effectively a two-digit or one-digit number, but in terms of the grid, D would be zero, which is allowed.

But, in our grid, D is the first digit of DEF, which is the bottom row. So D can be zero, but in the example given, D is 9. But in other cases, D can be zero.

So, the first equation is ABC + DEF = 999, which holds for any ABC from 000 to 999, with DEF = 999 - ABC. But we also have the second condition: the sum of the three two-digit numbers from the columns, which are AD, BE, and CF, is 99.

So, AD + BE + CF = 99.

Let me write that as 10*A + D + 10*B + E + 10*C + F = 99.

Wait, because AD is a two-digit number, so 10*A + D. Similarly, BE is 10*B + E, CF is 10*C + F. So yes, the sum is 10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

So, 10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

Let me write that as 10S + T = 99, where S = A + B + C, and T = D + E + F.

So, 10S + T = 99. Therefore, S and T are non-negative integers such that 10S + T = 99, which implies S = 9 and T = 9, because 10*9 + 9 = 99.

Therefore, from the second condition, we have:

A + B + C = 9,

and

D + E + F = 9.

So, that's another set of equations.

So, to recap, we have:

1. ABC + DEF = 999.

2. A + B + C = 9.

3. D + E + F = 9.

So, now, the problem reduces to finding all possible assignments of digits A, B, C, D, E, F such that:

- A, B, C, D, E, F are digits (0-9).

- ABC + DEF = 999.

- A + B + C = 9.

- D + E + F = 9.

So, let's think about how to approach this.

From equation 1, since ABC + DEF = 999, and ABC is a three-digit number (possibly with leading zeros), and DEF is also a three-digit number (possibly with leading zeros). So, DEF = 999 - ABC.

But DEF is also a three-digit number, so 000 ≤ DEF ≤ 999. Similarly, ABC is 000 ≤ ABC ≤ 999.

But since ABC + DEF = 999, then DEF is uniquely determined once ABC is chosen.

But we also have that D + E + F = 9, and DEF is the number 100*D + 10*E + F.

Wait, but DEF is 999 - ABC. So, perhaps we can write:

D + E + F = 9.

But DEF is 999 - ABC.

So, DEF is 999 - ABC.

But DEF = 100*D + 10*E + F.

So, 100*D + 10*E + F = 999 - (100*A + 10*B + C).

So, let me write that:

100D + 10E + F = 999 - (100A + 10B + C).

Let me rearrange that equation:

100D + 10E + F + 100A + 10B + C = 999.

But from the earlier conditions, we know that A + B + C = 9 and D + E + F = 9.

So, let's see:

100D + 10E + F + 100A + 10B + C = 999.

We can write this as:

100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

But since A + B + C = 9 and D + E + F = 9, then:

(A + D) + (B + E) + (C + F) = 9 + 9 = 18.

Wait, but that's the sum of all six digits, A, B, C, D, E, F.

But in the equation above, we have 100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

Let me denote:

Let S1 = A + D,

S2 = B + E,

S3 = C + F.

Then the equation becomes:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

And we also know that (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 9 + 9 = 18, which can be written as:

(A + D) + (B + E) + (C + F) = 18.

So, S1 + S2 + S3 = 18, where S1 = A + D, S2 = B + E, S3 = C + F.

And 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

So, we have two equations:

1. S1 + S2 + S3 = 18.

2. 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Let me subtract the first equation from the second equation:

(100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3) - (S1 + S2 + S3) = 999 - 18.

Simplify left side:

99*S1 + 9*S2 = 981.

Divide both sides by 9:

11*S1 + S2 = 109.

So, 11*S1 + S2 = 109.

Now, we have S1, S2, S3 as positive integers (since they are sums of digits, which are non-negative, but since A, B, C, D, E, F can be zero, but S1, S2, S3 can be zero or more? Wait, let me see:

Wait, S1 = A + D. A and D are digits, so each can be 0-9, so S1 can be 0-18.

Similarly for S2 and S3.

But from S1 + S2 + S3 = 18 and 11*S1 + S2 = 109, we can try to find possible S1 and S2.

So, from 11*S1 + S2 = 109, and S1 + S2 + S3 = 18, and S3 = 18 - S1 - S2.

But let's focus on 11*S1 + S2 = 109.

We can express S2 as S2 = 109 - 11*S1.

But since S2 is non-negative, 109 - 11*S1 ≥ 0 ⇒ 11*S1 ≤ 109 ⇒ S1 ≤ 109 / 11 ≈ 9.909. So S1 can be at most 9.

Also, since S1 = A + D, and A and D are digits (0-9), the minimum value of S1 is 0 (if A=0 and D=0) but in reality, considering ABC and DEF are numbers, perhaps A and D can be zero, but let's not restrict further for now.

Wait, but from S1 ≤ 9 and S1 must be an integer, so S1 can be from 0 to 9.

But let's check for each possible S1 from 0 to 9, whether S2 = 109 - 11*S1 is a non-negative integer and whether S1 + S2 ≤ 18 (since S3 must be non-negative as well, because S3 = 18 - S1 - S2 ≥ 0).

So let's compute S1 from 0 to 9 and see which ones satisfy the conditions.

Let's start with S1=9:

S2 = 109 - 11*9 = 109 - 99 = 10.

So S2=10.

Then S3 = 18 - 9 -10 = -1.

Wait, S3 can't be negative. So S1=9 is invalid.

Next, S1=8:

S2=109-88=21.

Then S3=18 -8 -21 = -11. Negative. Invalid.

S1=7:

S2=109-77=32.

S3=18-7-32= -21. Negative. Invalid.

S1=6:

S2=109-66=43.

S3=18-6-43= -31. Negative. Invalid.

S1=5:

S2=109-55=54.

S3=18-5-54= -41. Negative. Invalid.

S1=4:

S2=109-44=65.

S3=18-4-65= -51. Negative. Invalid.

S1=3:

S2=109-33=76.

S3=18-3-76= -61. Negative. Invalid.

S1=2:

S2=109-22=87.

S3=18-2-87= -71. Negative. Invalid.

S1=1:

S2=109-11=98.

S3=18-1-98= -81. Negative. Invalid.

S1=0:

S2=109-0=109.

S3=18-0-109= -91. Negative. Invalid.

Hmm, this is a problem. All S1 from 0 to 9 result in S3 being negative. That can't be possible.

Wait, that suggests that there's no solution, but we have the example given in the problem statement. So, something must be wrong with my reasoning.

Wait, let me double-check.

We have S1 + S2 + S3 =18,

and 100 S1 +10 S2 + S3=999.

Subtract: 99 S1 +9 S2=981 ⇒ 11 S1 + S2=109.

But when I tried S1=9, S2=10, then S3=18 -9 -10= -1. But in the example, what is S1, S2, S3?

In the example:

Top row: 0 0 8.

So A=0, B=0, C=8.

Bottom row:9 9 1.

So D=9, E=9, F=1.

So S1 = A+D=0+9=9.

S2=B+E=0+9=9.

S3=C+F=8+1=9.

So S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

Which sums to 27, but according to the earlier equation, S1 + S2 + S3 should be 18. Wait, that's a contradiction.

Wait, wait, wait. Did I make a mistake in defining S1, S2, S3?

Wait, in my earlier step, I defined S1 = A + D, S2 = B + E, S3 = C + F.

But in the example, S1=0+9=9, S2=0+9=9, S3=8+1=9. So S1+S2+S3=27, but according to the earlier equation, S1 + S2 + S3=18. That's a problem.

So, where did I go wrong?

Wait, let's go back to the equations.

We have:

From ABC + DEF = 999,

which is 100A +10B + C + 100D +10E + F =999.

Which can be written as 100(A+D) +10(B+E) + (C + F) =999.

So, 100 S1 +10 S2 + S3=999.

And from the column sums, AD + BE + CF=99.

Where AD is 10A + D,

BE is 10B + E,

CF is 10C + F.

So, sum is (10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) =10(A+B+C) + (D + E + F)=10*(9) +9=99.

So, that's correct.

But then, when I added the two equations:

100 S1 +10 S2 + S3 =999,

and S1 + S2 + S3=18,

I subtracted them to get 99 S1 +9 S2=981.

Which simplifies to 11 S1 + S2=109.

But from the example, S1=9, S2=9, which gives 11*9 +9=99 +9=108, which is not 109. So, the example doesn't satisfy this equation.

Wait, that's confusing because the example is given as a valid arrangement.

Wait, in the example, ABC=008=8, DEF=991=991.

So, ABC + DEF=8 + 991=999, which is correct.

And the sum of the three column numbers: AD=09=9, BE=09=9, CF=81=81.

Sum=9+9+81=99, which is correct.

So, why does it not satisfy the equation 11 S1 + S2=109?

Wait, because in the example, S1= A+D=0+9=9,

S2=B+E=0+9=9,

S3=C+F=8+1=9.

So, 11 S1 + S2= 99 +9=108≠109.

So, that suggests that my earlier equations might be flawed.

Wait, let's re-express the equations.

From ABC + DEF =999,

100A +10B + C +100D +10E + F =999.

Which is 100(A + D) +10(B + E) + (C + F) =999.

Which is 100 S1 +10 S2 + S3=999.

From the column sums,

AD + BE + CF=99,

which is (10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F)=99.

Which is 10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F)=99.

But A + B + C=9,

D + E + F=9.

So, 10*9 +9=99, which holds.

So, the sum of the columns is correct.

But when I added the two equations:

100 S1 +10 S2 + S3=999,

and S1 + S2 + S3=18,

I get 99 S1 +9 S2=981,

which simplifies to 11 S1 + S2=109.

But in the example, 11 S1 + S2=11*9 +9=108≠109.

So, the example doesn't satisfy this equation.

That suggests that either my equations are wrong, or the example is incorrect, but the problem statement says it is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, let me re-express the problem.

We have:

1. ABC + DEF =999,

which is 100A +10B + C +100D +10E + F=999.

So, 100(A + D) +10(B + E) + (C + F)=999.

Let me denote S1 = A + D,

S2 = B + E,

S3 = C + F.

So, 100 S1 +10 S2 + S3=999.

Also, from the column sums,

AD + BE + CF=99,

which is (10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F)=99.

Which is 10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F)=99.

Given A + B + C=9,

D + E + F=9,

so 10*9 +9=99.

So, that's correct.

But then, the first equation is 100 S1 +10 S2 + S3=999,

and the sum S1 + S2 + S3=18.

So, subtracting:

99 S1 +9 S2=981,

which is 11 S1 + S2=109.

But in the example, S1=9, S2=9,

so 11*9 +9=99+9=108≠109.

So, the example does not satisfy this equation. So, that suggests that either the example is not valid, which contradicts the problem statement, or I made a mistake in the reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the equations.

Wait, let's take the example and see what S1, S2, S3 are.

In the example:

A=0, B=0, C=8,

D=9, E=9, F=1.

So,

S1 = A + D =0 +9=9,

S2 = B + E=0 +9=9,

S3= C + F=8 +1=9.

So, S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

Now, plug into 100 S1 +10 S2 + S3=100*9 +10*9 +9=900 +90 +9=999. Correct.

And S1 + S2 + S3=27≠18.

Wait, so S1 + S2 + S3=27, but earlier I thought it was 18.

Wait, that's a mistake. Where did I get 18 from?

Wait, from the column sum equations.

We have:

10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F)=99,

which is 10*9 +9=99.

But S1 + S2 + S3 = (A + D) + (B + E) + (C + F) = (A + B + C) + (D + E + F)=9 +9=18.

Ah! So S1 + S2 + S3=18.

But in the example, S1 + S2 + S3=27.

So, that's a contradiction.

Wait, but that can't be. What's wrong here?

Wait, in the example,

A=0, B=0, C=8,

D=9, E=9, F=1.

So,

A + B + C=0+0+8=8≠9.

Wait, wait, wait. The example says A=0, B=0, C=8, so ABC=008=8.

But earlier, we had A + B + C=9.

But in the example, A + B + C=0+0+8=8≠9.

Similarly, D + E + F=9 +9 +1=19≠9.

So, this suggests that the example does not satisfy the second condition.

But the problem statement says it does: "the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99."

Wait, let's compute AD + BE + CF.

AD=09=9,

BE=09=9,

CF=81=81.

Sum=9+9+81=99.

So, that's correct.

But according to our equations, A + B + C=8≠9, D + E + F=19≠9.

Wait, so there's a problem in the way I set up the equations.

Ah, I see. Because AD is 10*A + D, which is a two-digit number. So, in the example, A=0, D=9, so AD=09=9.

Similarly, BE=09=9, CF=81=81.

So, the sum is 9+9+81=99.

But A + B + C=0+0+8=8, D + E + F=9+9+1=19.

So, 10*(A+B+C) + (D+E+F)=10*8 +19=80 +19=99, which is correct.

So, my earlier assumption that A + B + C=9 and D + E + F=9 was incorrect.

Wait, no, because 10*(A+B+C) + (D + E + F)=99.

Which can be written as 10S + T=99, where S=A+B+C, T=D+E+F.

So, 10S + T=99.

Which means that S and T must satisfy 10S + T=99.

So, S=9, T=9, because 10*9 +9=99.

But in the example, S=8, T=19, which also satisfies 10*8 +19=99.

Wait, but 10S + T=99.

So, S can be any integer such that 10S ≤99 ⇒ S ≤9.

But in the example, S=8, T=19.

But T must be ≤99 -10*0=99, but T is the sum of D, E, F, which are digits, so T can be up to 27 (if D=E=F=9). Wait, but in our case, T= D+E+F=19, which is possible.

Wait, but from the equation 10S + T=99,

and T = D + E + F,

and S = A + B + C,

we have 10S + T=99,

but S and T can be any non-negative integers such that 10S + T=99.

So, S can range from 0 to 9, and for each S, T=99 -10S.

But T must also be the sum of three digits D, E, F, each from 0-9, so T can be from 0 to 27.

But since T=99 -10S,

for S=0: T=99 ⇒ invalid, since T can't exceed 27.

S=1: T=89 ⇒ invalid.

S=2: T=79 ⇒ invalid.

S=3: T=69 ⇒ invalid.

S=4: T=59 ⇒ invalid.

S=5: T=49 ⇒ invalid.

S=6: T=39 ⇒ invalid.

S=7: T=29 ⇒ invalid.

S=8: T=19 ⇒ valid.

S=9: T=9 ⇒ valid.

So, only S=8 (T=19) and S=9 (T=9) are valid.

So, in the example, S=8, T=19, which is valid.

Similarly, S=9, T=9 is also valid.

So, I was wrong earlier to assume that S=9 and T=9 are the only possibilities. Actually, there are two possibilities:

Either S=9 and T=9,

or S=8 and T=19.

So, that changes everything.

So, going back, we have two cases:

Case 1: S=9, T=9.

Case 2: S=8, T=19.

So, in each case, we can proceed to find the number of solutions.

So, let's first handle the first case: S=9, T=9.

Case 1: A + B + C =9,

and D + E + F=9.

And from the first equation, ABC + DEF=999.

But DEF=999 - ABC.

So, DEF=999 - (100A +10B + C).

But DEF is a three-digit number, so 000 ≤ DEF ≤999.

Similarly, ABC is a three-digit number, with A, B, C digits.

So, ABC can be from 000 to999, with A+B+C=9.

Similarly, DEF=999 - ABC, which must satisfy D + E + F=9.

So, for this case, we need to count the number of ABC such that A + B + C=9, and DEF=999 - ABC has D + E + F=9.

Similarly, in Case 2: S=8, T=19.

So, A + B + C=8,

and D + E + F=19.

And again, DEF=999 - ABC.

So, for this case, we need to count the number of ABC where A + B + C=8, and DEF=999 - ABC has D + E + F=19.

So, our total number of solutions is the sum of the number of solutions in Case 1 and Case 2.

So, let's first tackle Case 1: A + B + C=9, D + E + F=9.

We need to find all ABC such that A + B + C=9, and DEF=999 - ABC has D + E + F=9.

But DEF=999 - ABC.

So, DEF=999 - (100A +10B + C).

Which can be written as DEF= 999 - ABC.

But DEF is a three-digit number, so let's compute DEF in terms of A, B, C.

Let me think about the digits of DEF.

Let me denote ABC as a three-digit number, possibly with leading zeros.

So, ABC = 100A +10B + C.

Then, DEF = 999 - ABC.

But 999 is 999, so when we subtract ABC, we have:

DEF = 999 - ABC.

So, let's compute DEF's digits in terms of A, B, C.

Let me consider the subtraction digit by digit, borrowing as necessary.

Let me write ABC as:

A B C

Subtracting from 999:

9 9 9

- A B C

= D E F

So, let's compute each digit:

Starting from the units place:

9 - C = F (possibly borrowing).

Tens place:

9 - B - borrow = E (possibly borrowing).

Hundreds place:

9 - A - borrow = D.

Wait, but let's think carefully about the borrowing.

Let me compute F first:

Units digit: 9 - C = F (if 9 >= C, no borrow).

If 9 < C, then F = 9 - C +10, and borrow 1 from the tens place.

Similarly, for the tens digit:

We have 9 (original) minus borrow (if any from units digit) minus B = E.

Wait, let's formalize it.

Let me denote borrow variables.

Let me define:

Let b1 be the borrow from units to tens. b1 is 1 if 9 < C (so we borrow 1, making it 19 - C), else 0.

Similarly, b2 is the borrow from tens to hundreds. b2 is 1 if (9 - b1) < B, else 0.

So, computing F:

F = (9 - C) if C ≤9. Since C is a digit, this is always true. So F =9 - C + 10*b1.

But wait, no: if C >9, but C is a digit, so C ≤9. So F=9 - C.

But if 9 - C is negative, we have to borrow.

Wait, no, C is a digit from 0-9, so 9 - C is from 0-9. So, F=9 - C.

Wait, but wait, no: 9 - C could be non-negative, but if we have to borrow, it's when 9 - C is negative, but since C can't exceed 9, 9 - C is always ≥0. So, no borrow from units place. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, let's think: when subtracting C from 9 in the units place, if C ≤9, then F=9 - C, no borrow.

If C >9, which is impossible since C is a digit, so F=9 - C, and no borrow.

So, b1=0.

Wait, that can't be right because when subtracting, if the top digit is less than the bottom digit, you have to borrow. But in this case, it's 9 - C.

Wait, no, in the subtraction, it's 9 - C. So, if C ≤9, which it always is, then F=9 - C, and no borrow.

So, b1=0.

Similarly, moving to the tens digit:

We have 9 (original) minus B, but since we didn't borrow from the units place, it's 9 - B = E.

But again, if 9 - B is negative, we have to borrow. Wait, but B is a digit from 0-9, so 9 - B is from 0-9. So, E=9 - B, and no borrow from tens to hundreds.

Wait, that can't be right because in the hundreds place, we have 9 - A = D.

But if there was a borrow in the tens place, it would affect the hundreds place.

Wait, but since in the units and tens places, we didn't have to borrow, the hundreds place subtraction is 9 - A = D.

So, D=9 - A.

But D must be a digit, so 9 - A must be ≥0 ⇒ A ≤9, which is always true.

So, D=9 - A.

But wait, in the example, A=0, so D=9, which matches.

Similarly, if A=1, D=8, etc.

So, from this, we can see that:

D =9 - A,

E=9 - B,

F=9 - C.

But wait, wait a minute. Let's test this with the example.

In the example, A=0, B=0, C=8.

So, D=9 -0=9,

E=9 -0=9,

F=9 -8=1.

Which matches the example: D=9, E=9, F=1.

So, that works.

But let's take another example. Suppose ABC=123.

Then, D=9-1=8,

E=9-2=7,

F=9-3=6.

So, DEF=876.

And ABC + DEF=123 +876=999. Correct.

Similarly, if ABC=900,

then D=9-9=0,

E=9-0=9,

F=9 -0=9.

So, DEF=099=99.

So, 900 +99=999. Correct.

Wait, but DEF=099 is a three-digit number, which is allowed.

So, in this case, for ABC with A + B + C=9, DEF=999 - ABC has digits D=9 - A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C.

So, for each ABC where A + B + C=9, DEF is determined as D=9 - A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C.

But we also require that D + E + F=9.

So, in this case, since D=9 - A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C,

then D + E + F= (9 - A) + (9 - B) + (9 - C)=27 - (A + B + C).

But since A + B + C=9,

D + E + F=27 -9=18.

But in Case 1, we require D + E + F=9.

So, 18≠9. So, this is a problem.

Wait, so in Case 1, S=9, T=9,

but D + E + F=18≠9.

So, this is impossible.

So, no solutions in Case 1.

Wait, that can't be right because the example is in Case 2.

Wait, but in Case 1, we have S=9, T=9,

but from the way DEF is computed, D + E + F=18.

So, T=18≠9. So, no solutions in Case 1.

So, only solutions are in Case 2.

Case 2: S=8, T=19.

So, A + B + C=8,

and D + E + F=19.

But DEF=999 - ABC.

So, DEF=999 - ABC.

But we have to compute DEF's digits D, E, F in terms of A, B, C.

Again, let's perform the subtraction:

999 - ABC = DEF.

So,

A B C

Subtract from

9 9 9

to get

D E F.

Let me compute each digit with possible borrowing.

Starting from the units place:

9 - C = F.

If C ≤9, which it is, then F=9 - C.

No borrow.

Tens place:

9 - B = E.

No borrow, since B ≤9.

Hundreds place:

9 - A = D.

But wait, let me check if there's any borrowing.

Wait, in the units place, 9 - C ≥0, so no borrow.

In the tens place, 9 - B ≥0, so no borrow.

In the hundreds place, 9 - A ≥0, so no borrow.

So, D=9 - A,

E=9 - B,

F=9 - C.

So, D + E + F= (9 - A) + (9 - B) + (9 - C)=27 - (A + B + C).

But in Case 2, A + B + C=8,

so D + E + F=27 -8=19, which matches the requirement.

So, for Case 2, when A + B + C=8,

then D + E + F=19,

and DEF=999 - ABC,

with D=9 - A,

E=9 - B,

F=9 - C.

So, all the conditions are satisfied.

Thus, the number of solutions is equal to the number of ABC such that A + B + C=8, multiplied by the constraints that D=9 - A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C are digits (i.e., D, E, F must be between 0 and9).

But since A, B, C are digits (0-9), and A + B + C=8,

then D=9 - A must be a digit, so 9 - A ≥0 ⇒ A ≤9, which is always true.

Similarly, E=9 - B ≥0 ⇒ B ≤9,

F=9 - C ≥0 ⇒ C ≤9.

So, D, E, F are all digits as long as A, B, C are digits.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to A + B + C=8,

where A, B, C are digits (i.e., 0 ≤ A, B, C ≤9).

But since 8 ≤9*3=27, and each variable is at least 0, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to A + B + C=8,

which is C(8 +3 -1, 3 -1)=C(10,2)=45.

But wait, that's the number of solutions without considering the digit constraints.

But since A, B, C can be at most 9, and 8 ≤ 9, none of the variables can exceed 9, so all solutions are valid.

So, the number of solutions is 45.

But wait, each of these solutions corresponds to a unique ABC, and each ABC determines DEF uniquely as D=9 - A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C.

So, the number of valid grids is 45.

But wait, let me confirm with the example.

In the example, A=0, B=0, C=8,

so D=9-0=9,

E=9-0=9,

F=9-8=1.

Which is exactly the example given.

Another example: A=1, B=2, C=5.

Then D=8, E=7, F=4.

So, ABC=125, DEF=874.

Check sum:125 +874=999.

Column sums: AD=18, BE=27, CF=54.

Sum:18+27+54=99.

So, that works.

Another example: A=8, B=0, C=0.

Then D=1, E=9, F=9.

ABC=800, DEF=199.

Sum:800 +199=999.

Column sums: AD=81, BE=09=9, CF=09=9.

Sum:81 +9 +9=99.

But wait, AD=81, which is 81, BE=09=9, CF=09=9.

Sum=81+9+9=99. Correct.

Wait, but in this case, A=8, which is allowed since A is a digit.

So, all solutions where A + B + C=8 are valid.

So, the number of solutions is 45.

But wait, let me confirm that in all cases, D, E, F are digits.

Since A, B, C are digits, D=9 - A is between 0 and9,

E=9 - B is between0 and9,

F=9 - C is between0 and9.

So, all are valid.

Thus, the total number of ways is 45.


To solve the problem, we analyze the 2x3 grid where the sum of the two three-digit numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three two-digit numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. 

### Key Steps:
1. **Define Variables**: Label the grid cells as follows:
   ```
   A B C
   D E F
   ```
   - The top row forms the number \( ABC \), and the bottom row forms \( DEF \).
   - The columns form the numbers \( AD \), \( BE \), and \( CF \).

2. **Sum Conditions**:
   - \( ABC + DEF = 999 \).
   - \( AD + BE + CF = 99 \).

3. **Column Sum Equation**:
   - Expressing the column sum: \( 10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99 \).
   - Let \( S = A + B + C \) and \( T = D + E + F \). Then, \( 10S + T = 99 \).

4. **Possible Values for \( S \) and \( T \)**:
   - \( S \) and \( T \) must satisfy \( 10S + T = 99 \) with \( S \) and \( T \) as non-negative integers.
   - Solutions are \( (S, T) = (9, 9) \) and \( (8, 19) \).

5. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1 (\( S = 9, T = 9 \))**: This leads to a contradiction because \( D + E + F = 18 \neq 9 \).
   - **Case 2 (\( S = 8, T = 19 \))**: This is valid. Here, \( A + B + C = 8 \) and \( D + E + F = 19 \).

6. **Determining \( D, E, F \)**:
   - For \( ABC + DEF = 999 \), \( DEF = 999 - ABC \).
   - The digits of \( DEF \) are \( D = 9 - A \), \( E = 9 - B \), \( F = 9 - C \).

7. **Counting Solutions**:
   - The number of solutions to \( A + B + C = 8 \) with \( A, B, C \) as digits (0-9) is given by the stars and bars method.
   - The number of non-negative integer solutions is \( \binom{8 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{10}{2} = 45 \).

### Conclusion:
The total number of valid grids is **45**.

\boxed{45}
