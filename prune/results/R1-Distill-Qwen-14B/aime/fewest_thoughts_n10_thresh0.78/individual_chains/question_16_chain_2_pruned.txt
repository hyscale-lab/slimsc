Okay, so I have this math problem in front of me. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared. Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared. Hmm, that sounds a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to find the smallest prime p where there's some n where n^4 +1 is divisible by p squared, which is p². So, p is the smallest prime for which p² divides n^4 +1 for some n. Once I find that p, I then need to find the smallest m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by p².

Let me start by understanding what it means for p² to divide n^4 +1. That means n^4 ≡ -1 mod p². So, n^4 is congruent to -1 modulo p². I remember that for primes p, if p divides a^k +1, then the order of a modulo p must divide 2k, but I might need to think more about how that applies here, especially since we're dealing with p squared.

I think I should start checking small primes and see if any of them satisfy the condition that p² divides n^4 +1 for some n. The primes in order are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. So let's check each one.

Starting with p=2. Is there an n such that n^4 +1 is divisible by 4? Let's compute n^4 mod 4 for n=1,2,3, etc.

n=1: 1 +1=2. 2 mod4 is 2, not 0.

n=2: 16+1=17. 17 mod4 is 1, not 0.

n=3: 81 +1=82. 82 mod4 is 2, not 0.

Wait, so n^4 mod4: Let's compute it for n=0,1,2,3:

n=0: 0 +1=1 mod4
n=1: 1 +1=2 mod4
n=2: 16 +1=17 mod4=1
n=3: 81 +1=82 mod4= 2

So, n^4 +1 mod4 is either 1 or 2, never 0. So 4 doesn't divide n^4 +1 for any n. So p=2 is out.

Next prime is 3. Check if 9 divides n^4 +1 for some n.

Compute n^4 mod9 for n=0 to 8:

n=0: 0 +1=1 mod9
n=1:1 +1=2 mod9
n=2:16 +1=17 mod9=8
n=3:81 +1=82 mod9= 82-9*9= 82-81=1
n=4:256 +1=257. 257 mod9: 2+5+7=14, 1+4=5, so 257 mod9=5
Wait, actually, maybe a better way is to compute n^4 mod9:

n | n^4 mod9
0 |0
1 |1
2 |16 mod9=7
3 |81 mod9=0
4 | (4^2=16 mod9=7, 7^2=49 mod9=4)
5 | (5^2=25 mod9=7, 7^2=49 mod9=4)
6 | (6^2=36 mod9=0, 0^2=0)
7 | (7^2=49 mod9=4, 4^2=16 mod9=7)
8 | (8^2=64 mod9=1, 1^2=1)
So, n^4 mod9 is: for n=0:0, n=1:1, n=2:7, n=3:0, n=4:4, n=5:4, n=6:0, n=7:7, n=8:1.

So n^4 +1 mod9 would be: for n=0:1, n=1:2, n=2:8, n=3:1, n=4:5, n=5:5, n=6:1, n=7:8, n=8:2.

So none of them are 0 mod9. So 9 doesn't divide n^4 +1 for any n. So p=3 is out.

Next prime is 5. Check if 25 divides n^4 +1 for some n.

Compute n^4 mod25 for n from 0 to 24. That's a lot, but maybe we can find a pattern or some shortcut.

Alternatively, perhaps I can first check if 5 divides n^4 +1, which would be n^4 ≡ -1 mod5. Let's see if that's possible.

Compute n^4 mod5 for n=0,1,2,3,4:

0:0
1:1
2:16
