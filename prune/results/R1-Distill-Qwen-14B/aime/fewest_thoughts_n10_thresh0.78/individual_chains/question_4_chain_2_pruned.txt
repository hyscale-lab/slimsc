Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and on each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, sounds like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I remember these often involve finding winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote each position (number of tokens left) as either a winning (W) or losing (L) position. The base case is when there are 0 tokens left. If it's your turn and there are 0 tokens, you lose because you can't make a move. Wait, but in this problem, the person who takes the last token wins. So, if n=0, the game is already over, and the previous player has won. So maybe n=0 is a losing position for the player about to move.

Wait, let me think. If n=0, the current player can't move, so they lose. So n=0 is a losing position (L). For n=1, the player can take 1 token and win, so it's a winning position (W). Similarly, n=2, take 1, leave 1 for the opponent, who then takes 1 and wins. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, let me be precise. Let's build the positions step by step.

- n=0: current player loses (L)
- n=1: current player takes 1, wins (W)
- n=2: current player can take 1, leaving 1 for opponent, who then takes 1 and wins. Or take 4, which isn't possible since n=2. So the only move is to take 1, resulting in opponent winning. So n=2 is L?
Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, you take 1, leaving 1 for opponent, who then takes 1 and wins. So for n=2, the current player cannot force a win? So n=2 is a losing position (L).

Wait, no, that can't be right. If n=2, you take 1, opponent is left with 1, which is a W position for them. So n=2 is a losing position for the current player.

Wait, how about n=3: take 1, leaving 2, which is L for the opponent. So n=3 is W.

n=4: you can take 4 and win, so W.

n=5: Let's see. If you take 1, opponent is left with 4, which is W. So opponent can win. If you take 4, opponent is left with 1, which is W for them. So n=5, no matter what you do, opponent can win. So n=5 is L.

n=6: If you take 1, opponent has 5, which is L. So you can force opponent into a losing position. So n=6 is W.

n=7: Take 1, opponent has
