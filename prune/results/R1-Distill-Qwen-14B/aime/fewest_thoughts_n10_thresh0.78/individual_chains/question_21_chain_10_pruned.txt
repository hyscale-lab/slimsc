Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, let me understand what a b-eautiful number is. The problem says a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. So n must be between b^1 and b^2 - 1, right? Because in base b, the smallest two-digit number is 10_b which is equal to b in decimal, and the largest is (b-1)(b-1)_b which is b^2 - 1 in decimal.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. So if the two digits are, say, d1 and d2, then d1 + d2 = sqrt(n).

Alright, so for n to be b-eautiful, n must satisfy:
- n = d1 * b + d2
- d1 + d2 = sqrt(n)

Since d1 and d2 are digits in base b, d1 can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and d2 can range from 0 to b-1.

Let me write down the equations:

Let me denote the digits as d1 and d2. Then,
n = d1 * b + d2
and
d1 + d2 = sqrt(n) = s (let's say s is the square root)

So, substituting sqrt(n) = s into the first equation:
n = s^2 = d1 * b + d2

Also, since s = d1 + d2, I can write:
s = d1 + d2

So, substituting d2 = s - d1 into the equation for n:
s^2 = d1 * b + (s - d1)
s^2 = d1 * (b - 1) + s

Let me rearrange this equation:
d1 * (b - 1) = s^2 - s

So,
d1 = (s^2 - s) / (b - 1)

Since d1 must be an integer (as it's a digit) and 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b - 1, the numerator (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, the result of the division must be an integer within the range of d1.

So, for each base b, I can look for integers s such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) is an integer between 1 and b - 1, and d2 = s - d1 is between 0 and b - 1.

Alternatively, for a given b, I can consider possible s values and see whether the conditions are met. But since we need to find the minimal b with more than ten such n's, perhaps it's better to approach this by considering the possible s and see what constraints they impose on b.

Let me consider s. Since s = d1 + d2, and d1 is at least 1, d2 is at least 0. So the minimum s is 1 + 0 = 1. The maximum s is (b - 1) + (b - 1) = 2b - 2. So s ranges from 1 to 2b - 2.

But also, n = s^2 must be a two-digit number in base b, meaning n is between b and b^2 - 1. So s^2 must be ≥ b and ≤ b^2 - 1. Therefore, s must be ≥ sqrt(b) and ≤ sqrt(b^2 - 1). But sqrt(b^2 - 1) is approximately b - 1/(2b), so s can be up to b - 1.

Wait, let me see: s^2 ≤ b^2 - 1 implies s ≤ sqrt(b^2 - 1) ≈ b - 0.5. So s can be up to floor(b - 0.5), which is b - 1 when b is an integer ≥2.

So, for each b, s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b - 1.

Wait, no, because s^2 must be ≥ b. So s must be ≥ sqrt(b). So s starts from the smallest integer s_min such that s_min^2 ≥ b.

So for each b, s ranges from s_min = ceil(sqrt(b)) to s_max = b - 1.

So for each b, the possible s values are integers from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b - 1.

Now, for each such s, we can compute d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1). We need d1 to be an integer between 1 and b - 1.

So, for each b, the number of b-eautiful integers is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1] such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) is an integer between 1 and b - 1, and d2 = s - d1 is between 0 and b - 1.

Alternatively, for a given b, the number of solutions is the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b
