Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C intersect at D, and AD intersects ω again at P. Given sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10, I need to find AP as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then compute m + n.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some important theorems and properties related to circles and tangents. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, I remember that BD and CD are tangents from D to ω. A key property is that the lengths of tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal. So, BD = CD. That might be useful later.

I also recall that the point where the tangents meet, D, is called the ex-pole of BC with respect to the circle ω. Maybe I can use some properties related to poles and polars, but I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, perhaps using power of a point could help here since D lies outside the circle and we have tangents.

Power of a point D with respect to ω: the power is equal to DB² = DC² = DA * DP. Wait, because AD is a secant that passes through the circle, so by the power of a point theorem, DA * DP = DB². So if I can find DB, I can relate DA and DP.

But wait, I don't know DB yet. Maybe I can compute DB in terms of the sides of the triangle. Let me think about how to find DB.

First, perhaps I should find the circumradius of triangle ABC because the tangents from D to ω will relate to the circumradius.

Given triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let's denote sides as a=BC=9, b=AC=10, c=AB=5.

Using the formula for the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where Δ is the area of the triangle.

So I need to compute Δ first. Let's use Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (5 + 9 +10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Then Δ = sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)] = sqrt[12*(12-9)*(12-10)*(12-5)] = sqrt[12 * 3 * 2 * 7] = sqrt[504]. Simplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 = 16 * 31.5 is not exact. Let me factor it properly.

504: divide by 2: 252; again by 2: 126; again by 2: 63; 63 is 7*9=7*3^2.

So 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7. So sqrt(504) = 2^(3/2) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). So Δ = 6√14.

So R = (a*b*c)/(4Δ) = (5*9*10)/(4*6√14) = (450)/(24√14) = (75)/(4√14). Rationalizing the denominator: (75√14)/(4*14) = (75√14)/56. So R = 75√14 / 56.

Wait, but do I need R for this problem? Maybe not directly. Let me think about the power of point D.

Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, the power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DC². Also, from power of a point, DA * DP = DB².

So if I can find DA, then DP = (DB²)/DA. Then AP = AD - DP (since P is on AD between A and D? Wait, no, actually, AD is a secant that starts at A, goes through P, then exits at D? Wait, no. Wait, the line AD starts at A, goes through P (which is on ω), and then goes to D. So the order is A --- P --- D. So AP is part of AD, with P between A and D. So AP = AD - PD. Wait, but if D is outside the circle, then AD is a secant from A through P to D. So AP * AD = power of A? Wait, no, the power of A with respect to ω is zero because A is on ω. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, no. Power of a point A with respect to ω is zero because A is on ω. So that doesn't help. But for point D, power is DB² = DC² = DA * DP.

So if I can compute DB, then I can express DA * DP = DB². But I don't know DA or DP yet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find coordinates for the points and compute everything algebraically. That might be a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.

Let me try setting up coordinate axes. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0). Let me place point A at (10,0) since AC=10. Then point B is somewhere in the plane. Given AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10.

So coordinates: C=(0,0), A=(10,0). Let me find coordinates of B.

Let’s denote B=(x,y). Then distance from B to C is 9: sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 9 => x² + y² = 81.

Distance from B to A is 5: sqrt((x-10)^2 + y^2) = 5 => (x-10)^2 + y² = 25.

Subtract the first equation from the second: (x-10)^2
