Okay, so I have this problem about Aya's walks. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

So, Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She goes at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, and this takes her 4 hours, but that includes some time 't' minutes she spends in the coffee shop. Then, when she walks faster, at s + 2 km/h, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same 't' minutes in the coffee shop. Now, we need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the coffee shop time.

Hmm, okay. Let me parse this. It seems like the time she spends walking is the total time minus the coffee shop time 't'. Because the total time includes both walking and the coffee stop. So, when she walks at speed s, her walking time is 4 hours minus t minutes. Similarly, when she walks at s + 2 km/h, her walking time is 2 hours 24 minutes minus t minutes.

Wait, but the problem says the total time includes t minutes spent in the coffee shop. So, the walking time alone would be the total time minus t. So, for the first scenario, total time is 4 hours, which includes walking plus t minutes. So the walking time is 4 hours minus t minutes. Similarly for the second scenario, total time is 2 h 24 min, so walking time is that minus t minutes.

But since the distances are the same (9 km), I can set up equations based on the formula: distance = speed × time.

Let me convert everything into hours to make it consistent.

First scenario:
Walking speed = s km/h
Total time = 4 hours
Walking time = 4 hours - t/60 hours (since t is in minutes)
So, walking time = (4 - t/60) hours
Distance = s × (4 - t/60) = 9 km

Second scenario:
Walking speed = s + 2 km/h
Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours
Walking time = 2.4 hours - t/60 hours
Distance = (s + 2) × (2.4 - t/60) = 9 km

So now I have two equations:

1. s × (4 - t/60) = 9
2. (s + 2) × (2.4 - t/60) = 9

I can write these equations and solve for s and t.

Let me rewrite equation 1:

s*(4 - t/60) = 9 --> equation (1)

Equation 2:

(s + 2)*(2.4 - t/60) = 9 --> equation (2)

I can divide both sides by the time to solve for s and t. Hmm, but maybe I can express both equations in terms of s and t and then solve them simultaneously.

Let me first expand equation (1):

s * 4 - s*(t/60) = 9

Similarly, equation (2):

(s + 2)*2.4 - (s + 2)*(t/60) = 9

Let me compute equation (2):

s*2.4 + 2*2.4 - s*(t/60) - 2*(t/60) = 9

So, equation (2) becomes:

2.4s + 4.8 - (s*t)/60 - (2t)/60 = 9

Now, let me write down both equations again for clarity.

Equation (1):

4s - (s t)/60 = 9 --> let me denote (s t)/60 as (s t)/60

Equation (2):

2.4s + 4.8 - (s t)/60 - (2t)/60 = 9

Hmm, perhaps I can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate the term (s t)/60.

Wait, but equation (2) has more terms. Let me rearrange both equations.

Equation (1): 4s - (s t)/60 = 9

Equation (2): 2.4s - (s t)/60 - (2t)/60 + 4.8 = 9

Let me subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

[2.4s - (s t)/60 - (2t)/60 +4.8] - [4s - (s t)/60] = 9 - 9

Simplify:

2.4s - (s t)/60 - (2t)/60 +4.8 -4s + (s t)/60 = 0

The (s t)/60 terms cancel out.

So, 2.4s -4s - (2t)/60 +4.8 = 0

Combine like terms:

(2.4 -4)s - (2t)/60 +4.8 = 0

-1.6s - (2t)/60 +4.8 = 0

Let me write that as:

-1.6s - (t/30) +4.8 = 0

Multiply all terms by 30 to eliminate denominators:

-48s - t + 144 = 0

So,

-48s - t = -144

Or,

48s + t = 144 --> equation (3)

Now, from equation (1):

4s - (s t)/60 = 9

Let me express this as:

Multiply both sides by 60 to eliminate denominators:

240s - s t = 540

So,

s(240 - t) = 540 --> equation (4)

From equation (3): t = 144 -48s

I can substitute t from equation (3) into equation (4):

s(240 - (144 -48s)) = 540

Simplify inside the parentheses:

240 -144 +48s = 96 +48s

So, equation becomes:

s*(96 +48s) = 540

Which is:

96s +48s² = 540

Let me divide both sides by 12 to simplify:

8s +4s² = 45

Rewrite as:

4s² +8s -45 = 0

That's a quadratic equation. Let me compute discriminant D:

D = 8² -4*4*(-45) = 64 +720 = 784

Square root of 784 is 28.

So, s = [-8 ±28]/(2*4) = (20)/(8) or (-36)/8

But speed can't be negative, so s = 20/8 = 2.5 km/h

So, s is 2.5 km/h.

Now, substitute back to equation (3) to find t:

48s + t =144

48*2.5 = 120

So,

120 + t =144 --> t =24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes.

Now, we need to find the time when Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

So, s is 2.5, so s + 0.5 is 3 km/h.

We need to find the total time when she walks at 3 km/h, which includes t=24 minutes.

Wait, the total time includes the coffee shop time t, which is 24 minutes. So, the total time is the walking time plus 24 minutes.

But wait, when she walks at 3 km/h, the time taken to walk 9 km is 9/3=3 hours. So, the walking time is 3 hours, and then she spends t=24 minutes in the coffee shop. So, total time is 3 hours +24 minutes.

But wait, does the problem say that when she walks at a certain speed, the total time is the walking time plus t? Yes. So, the total time when walking at 3 km/h is 3 hours +24 minutes.

Let me compute that in minutes for the answer. 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 is 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the total time as the walking time plus t. So, walking time is 9/(s + 1/2). Since s is 2.5, s +1/2 is 3 km/h. So, walking time is 9/3=3 hours, which is 180 minutes. Then, adding t=24 minutes, the total is 204 minutes.

So, the answer is 204 minutes.

But let me just double-check everything to make sure.

First, s=2.5, t=24.

Check first scenario:

Walking speed s=2.5 km/h. Walking time is 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours, which is 3 hours 36
