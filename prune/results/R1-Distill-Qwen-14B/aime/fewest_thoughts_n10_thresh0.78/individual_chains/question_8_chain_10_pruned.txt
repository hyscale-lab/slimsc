Okay, so I've got this problem to solve: I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. I have three variables a, b, c which are all nonnegative integers. Their sum is 300, which is a fixed number. Then, there's another equation involving their squares and products. I need to find all possible triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both conditions.

So, let's write down the equations again:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Hmm, maybe I can rewrite the second equation in a more manageable form. Let me see. I notice that each term is of the form x²y, where x and y are two different variables. So, it's symmetric in a, b, c, but not entirely homogeneous in degree because each term is degree 3.

Wait, maybe factoring could help. Let's see: The second equation can be factored as ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps much. Alternatively, perhaps factoring differently.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the expression a²b + a²c = a²(b + c). Similarly for the other terms. So, the entire expression is a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). Since a + b + c = 300, then b + c = 300 - a, similarly for the others. So, substituting:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

So, the equation becomes:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit better. Let me write that down:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Now, perhaps I can find expressions in terms of sums we already know, like a + b + c, and maybe ab + bc + ca, and so on.

I know that:

(a + b + c) = 300.

Also, I know that:

a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300.

Let me denote P = ab + bc + ca.

Then, a² + b² + c² = S² - 2P = 300² - 2P = 90,000 - 2P.

Similarly, I can express a³ + b³ + c³. There's a formula for that:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, substituting S and P:

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3 S P + 3abc.

So, plugging this back into the second equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 300(S² - 2P) - [S³ - 3 S P + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute 300(S² - 2P):

300*(90,000 - 2P) = 300*90,000 - 300*2P = 27,000,000 - 600P.

Then, subtract [S³ - 3 S P + 3abc]:

So, 27,000,000 - 600P - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc) = 6,000,000.

Wait, let me check S³: 300^3 is 27,000,000. Yup.

So, expanding the subtraction:

27,000,000 - 600P -27,000,000 + 900P - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Simplify terms:

27,
