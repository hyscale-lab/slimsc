Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand it first.

The problem is about a lottery that Jen is entering. She picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the four randomly chosen numbers.

The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention that this probability can be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime positive integers, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where A is the event we're interested in, and B is the condition.

In this case, event A is Jen winning the grand prize, and event B is her winning a prize. So, we're looking for P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But wait, if she wins the grand prize, then she must have won a prize, right? Because if all four numbers match, then she definitely has at least two matching. So, A is a subset of B. That means P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, the formula simplifies to P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to find P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize, and P(B), the probability of winning any prize (at least two matching numbers).

Let me calculate these probabilities.

First, I should figure out the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from S. Since S has 10 numbers, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4), which is the combination of 10 things taken 4 at a time. Let me compute that.

C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, there are 210 possible sets of 4 numbers that could be chosen.

Now, for P(A): the probability of winning the grand prize is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers match the four randomly chosen numbers. Since there's only one specific combination that would do this, the number of favorable outcomes is 1. So, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, I need to find P(B), the probability that Jen wins a prize, which happens when at least two of her numbers are among the four randomly chosen. This is a bit trickier because it involves counting all the scenarios where there are exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four matches. But since we know that P(A) is already the case where all four match, we can consider P(B) as the sum of probabilities of having exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four matches.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute the probability of the complementary event (i.e., having fewer than two matches) and subtract it from 1. But maybe it's easier to compute P(B) directly.

Let me try the complementary approach first. The complementary event is that Jen has 0 or 1 matching numbers. So, P(B) = 1 - P(0 matches) - P(1 match).

Let me compute P(0 matches): the probability that none of Jen's numbers are chosen. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S that don't include any of Jen's 4 numbers. Since Jen has 4 numbers, the remaining numbers are 10 - 4 = 6. So, the number of ways is C(6,4). Thus, P(0 matches) = C(6,4) / C(10,4).

C(6,4) = 15, so P(0 matches) = 15 / 210 = 1 / 14.

Next, P(1 match): the probability that exactly one of Jen's numbers is chosen. To compute this, we need to choose 1 number from Jen's 4, and the remaining 3 numbers from the 6 numbers not chosen by Jen. So, the number of favorable combinations is C(4,1) * C(6,3).

C(4,1) = 4, C(6,3) = 20. So, total favorable is 4 * 20 = 80. Hence, P(1 match) = 80 / 210.

Simplify that: 80 / 210 = 8 / 21.

So, P(B) = 1 - P(0) - P(1) = 1 - (1/14) - (8/21).

Compute this: Let me convert everything to 42 as the common denominator.

1 = 42/42,

1/14 = 3/42,

8/21 = 16/42.

So, P(B) = 42/42 - 3/42 -16/42 = (42 -3 -16)/4
