Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, then compute r squared, express it as a fraction p/q, and find p+q. Hmm, okay.

First, let me visualize this. A rectangular box has length, width, and height, say x, y, z. The sphere that can contain it must have a diameter at least equal to the space diagonal of the box. So, the space diagonal is sqrt(x² + y² + z²), and that will be equal to 2r, the diameter of the sphere. Therefore, r = (sqrt(x² + y² + z²))/2. So, to minimize r, I need to minimize the space diagonal, given the constraints on surface area and volume.

So, the problem reduces to minimizing sqrt(x² + y² + z²) subject to the surface area being 54 and volume being 23.

Let me write down the constraints.

Surface area of a rectangular box is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54.

Volume is xyz = 23.

So, I need to minimize x² + y² + z² given that 2(xy + yz + xz)=54 and xyz=23.

Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I can use Lagrange multipliers, but maybe there's a more straightforward approach.

Alternatively, for symmetric functions, sometimes assuming variables are equal gives minima or maxima. But in this case, the volume is 23, which is not a perfect cube, so the variables probably aren't equal. But maybe I can use inequalities.

Wait, I recall that for positive real numbers, the inequality between the arithmetic mean of squares and the square of arithmetic mean. Or maybe use the AM ≥ GM inequality.

But let me think step by step.

Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + xz, and Q = xyz.

Given that P = 54/2 = 27, and Q = 23.

I need to find the minimum of x² + y² + z². But x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + xz) = S² - 2P. Since P is 27, x² + y² + z² = S² - 54. So to minimize x² + y² + z², I need to minimize S².

So, the problem reduces to minimizing S², given that P =27 and Q=23.

So, I need to find the minimal possible value of S, given that (x + y + z)^3 ≥ something? Or perhaps use the inequality that relates S, P, Q.

Alternatively, I can use the AM-GM inequality for three variables. For positive real numbers, (x + y + z)/3 ≥ (xyz)^(1/3). So, S/3 ≥ (23)^(1/3).

Calculating 23^(1/3): 23 is between 8 (2^3) and 27 (3^3), so cube root of 23 is about 2.84. So, S ≥ 3 * 2.84 ≈ 8.52. But that's a rough lower bound.

But I think I can get a tighter bound because I know P =27.

Wait, another approach: I can consider that for given P and Q, what's the minimal S?

I think this is similar to optimizing S given P and Q. Maybe we can express S in terms of P and Q? Or perhaps use some inequality.

Alternatively, perhaps fix two variables and express the third in terms, then minimize.

Let me try that. Let's say x, y, z are positive real numbers. Let me fix x and y, then express z in terms of x and y.

From the volume constraint: z = 23/(xy).

From the surface area constraint: 2(xy + yz + xz) =54. Substituting z:

2[xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy))] =54.

Simplify:

2[xy + (23/y) + (23/x)] =54

Divide both sides by 2:

xy + (23/y) + (23/x) =27.

So, we have:

xy + 23/x +23/y =27.

Let me denote A = x + y, B = xy.

Then, 23/x +23/y =23(y + x)/(xy) =23A/B.

So, the equation becomes:

B + 23A/B =27.

Multiply both sides by B:

B² +23A =27B.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe instead, think of x and y as variables, express in terms of A and B.

Alternatively, perhaps consider symmetry. Let me set x = y, which might give me the minimal S.

Because often symmetric cases give extrema when variables are equal.

So, let's assume x = y, then.

If x = y, then z =23/(x²).

Surface area equation:

2(xy + yz + xz) =54.

Substitute x=y, z=23/x².

So, 2[x² + x*(23/x²) + x*(23/x²)] =54.

Simplify:

2[x² + 23/x +23/x] =54.

Which is:

2[x² + 46/x] =54.

Divide both sides by 2:

x² +46/x =27.

So, x² + 46/x =27.

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ +46 =27x.

So, x³ -27x +46 =0.

Hmm, solve this cubic equation: x³ -27x +46=0.

Let me check for rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46=20 ≠0.

x=2:8 -54 +46=0. Oh, x=2 is a root.

So, (x-2) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division.

Divide x³ -27x +46 by (x-2). Using synthetic division:

Coefficients: 1 (x³), 0 (x²), -27 (x), 46 (constant).

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 2: 2. Add to next term: 0 +2=2.

Multiply by 2:4. Add to next term: -27 +4= -23.

Multiply by 2: -46. Add to last term:46 + (-46)=0.

So, the cubic factors as (x-2)(x² +2x -23).

Set equal to zero: x=2, or x² +2x -23=0.

Solutions for x² +2x -23=0:

x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2sqrt(6).

Since x must be positive, x= -1 +2sqrt(6).

Wait, sqrt(6) is about 2.45, so 2sqrt(6)≈4.90. So, x≈-1+4.9
