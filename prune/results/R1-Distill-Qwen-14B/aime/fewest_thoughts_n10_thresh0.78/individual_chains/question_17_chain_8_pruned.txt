Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then I have to find p + q.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, let's recall that for a rectangular box with side lengths x, y, z, the surface area S is given by 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, and the volume V is xyz = 23. So, I can write those as:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 → xy + yz + xz = 27
2. xyz = 23

Now, the sphere that contains the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere is half of that, so r = d/2. Hence, r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, my goal is to find the minimum possible value of (x² + y² + z²)/4, given that xy + yz + xz = 27 and xyz = 23.

Wait, no. Actually, the sphere must contain all boxes from B, so the minimal sphere that can contain any such box. So, I need to find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B, and then the radius would be half of that maximum diagonal. So, I need to maximize x² + y² + z², given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Wait, no, that can't be right. The sphere needs to contain each box, so for each box, its space diagonal is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). The sphere's radius must be at least half of the maximum space diagonal across all boxes in B. So, to find r, I need to find the maximum possible value of sqrt(x² + y² + z²) / 2, where x, y, z satisfy the surface area and volume constraints.

Therefore, I need to maximize x² + y² + z², given that:

1. xy + yz + xz = 27
2. xyz = 23

So, how can I approach this? Maybe using Lagrange multipliers. Let me set up the function to maximize: f(x,y,z) = x² + y² + z², subject to the constraints g(x,y,z) = xy + yz + xz - 27 = 0 and h(x,y,z) = xyz - 23 = 0.

But since we have two constraints, this might get a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can express one variable in terms of the others using the volume equation and substitute into the surface area equation. Let me try that.

Let me assume that x, y, z are all positive real numbers since they represent side lengths.

Let me solve for z from the volume equation: z = 23/(xy)

Substitute into the surface area equation: xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy)) = 27

Simplify each term:

xy + 23/x + 23/y = 27

Wait, that's:

xy + (23/x) + (23/y) = 27

Hmm, that looks a bit tricky. Maybe I can let a = x + y, b = xy, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using symmetry.

Wait, maybe it's better to look for symmetric solutions. Suppose that two variables are equal, which might give the extremum. Let me assume that x = y. Then, since x = y, let's denote x = y. Then, z = 23/(x^2).

Now, substituting into the surface area equation:

x^2 + 2x z = 27

But z = 23/(x^2), so:

x^2 + 2x*(23/(x^2)) = 27

Simplify:

x^2 + (46)/x = 27

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate denominator:

x^3 + 46 = 27x

Bring all terms to one side:

x^3 - 27x + 46 = 0

Hmm, so I need to solve this cubic equation: x^3 -27x +46=0.

Let me see if I can find a rational root using the rational root theorem. Potential roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Let me test x=2:

2^3 -27*2 +46 = 8 -54 +46 = 0. Oh, so x=2 is a root.

Then, I can factor this as (x - 2)(x^2 + 2x -23)=0.

So, the other roots are solutions of x^2 + 2x -23=0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

Since x must be positive, x = -1 + 2*sqrt(6). Approximately, sqrt(6) ≈2.449, so 2*sqrt(6)≈4.898, so x≈3.898.

So, the solutions are x=2 and x≈-1 ± 4.898, but only positive x is valid, so x=2 and x≈3.898.

So, when x=2, then z=23/(2^2)=23/4=5.75.

So, the dimensions would be x=y=2, z=5.75.

Now, let's compute x² + y² + z² in this case: 2² + 2² + (23/4)^2 = 4 + 4 + (529/16) = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625. As a fraction, that's 41 + 1065/16? Wait, wait, 41.0625 is 41 + 0.0625 = 41 + 1/16. So, 41 + 1/16 = 657/16. So, x² + y² + z² = 657/16.

Wait, 657 divided by 16 is 41.0625, yes.

Wait, but when x≈3.898, let's compute x² + y² + z². Since x=y≈3.898, z=23/(x^2)=23/(approx 15.19)≈1.514.

So, x² ≈15.19, y²≈15.19, z²≈2.292.

Sum ≈15.19 +15.19 +2.292≈32.672.

Which is less than 41.0625.

So, when x=2, the sum is higher. So, perhaps the maximum occurs when x=2, y=2, z=23/4.

Wait, but is that the case? Maybe I should check if that's the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps if two variables are equal, but that gives a certain value. Maybe the maximum occurs when all variables are different. Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use Lagrange multipliers with two constraints.

Let me set up the Lagrangian:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + xz -27) - μ(xyz -23)

Then, taking partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, λ, μ and setting them to zero.

Partial derivatives:

dL/dx = 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0

dL/dy = 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0

dL/dz = 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0

And the constraints:

xy + yz + xz =27

xyz=23

So, we have a system of five equations.

Hmm, this seems a bit involved, but perhaps I can find a relationship between x, y, z.

Let me denote the partial derivatives as equations:

1. 2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)
2. 2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)
3. 2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

2y - 2x = λ(x + z - y - z) + μ(xz - yz)

Simplify:

2(y - x) = λ(x - y) + μ z (x - y)

Factor out (x - y):

2(y - x) = (x - y)(λ - μ z)

Divide both sides by (x - y) [assuming x ≠ y]:

2 = -(λ - μ z) → 2 = μ z - λ

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 3:

2z - 2y = λ(x + y - x - z) + μ(xy - xz)

Simplify:

2(z - y) = λ(y - z) + μ x (y - z)

Factor out (y - z):

2(z - y) = (y - z)(λ - μ x)

Divide both sides by (y - z) [assuming y ≠ z]:

2 = -(λ - μ x) → 2 = μ x - λ

So now, from these two results, we have:

From first subtraction: 2 = μ z - λ

From second subtraction: 2 = μ x - λ

Therefore, μ z - λ = μ x - λ → μ z = μ x → if μ ≠ 0, then z = x.

Wait, but if z = x, then from the earlier substitution, perhaps we can assume x = z.

Wait, but if x = z, then maybe my initial assumption that x = y is not the only case. Let me check.

If x = z, then perhaps I can set x = z and see what happens.

So, if x = z, then the constraints become:

xy + yx + x^2 =27 → 2xy + x² =27

And volume: x y x = x² y =23 → x² y=23 → y=23/(x²)

Substitute into surface area:

2x*(23/(x²)) +x² =27

Simplify:

(46/x) +x² =27

Multiply both sides by x:

46 +x³ =27x → x³ -27x +46=0

Wait, that's the same equation as before when I assumed x = y. So, x=2, x≈3.898, etc. So, perhaps the maximum occurs when x = z =2, y=23/(4)=5.75, which is what we had before.

Alternatively, if μ =0, then from 2 = μ z - λ = -λ → λ =-2. But then, from equation 1: 2x = λ(y + z) + μ yz. If μ=0, then 2x = -2(y + z). But x, y, z are positive, so 2x = -2(y + z) would imply x is negative, which is impossible. So, μ ≠0, hence, z=x.

So, from this, it's required that z=x.

So, in the case where z=x, we have x=2, y=5.75.

Wait, but wait, when x = z, the maximum sum x² + y² + z² is 657/16 ≈41.0625. But when I considered x≈3.898, which is when x = y, but then z is smaller, leading to a lower sum of squares. So, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, but not necessarily when all three variables are equal.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum occurs when one variable is as large as possible, and the other two as small as possible.

Wait, but given the constraints, is that possible? Let me think.

Suppose one variable is very large. Then, to maintain the volume, the other two variables would need to be small. But the surface area would be dominated by the products of the large variable with the small ones. But the surface area is fixed at 27, so if one variable increases, the others must decrease in a way that the sum of products remains 27.

Wait, maybe it's possible that when one variable is maximized, the sum of squares is maximized. So, perhaps I can consider the case where two variables approach zero, but then the volume would approach zero, which is not the case here. So, perhaps the maximum sum of squares occurs when two variables are equal, as in the case when x = y =2, z=5.75.

Alternatively, perhaps not. Let me see.

Wait, let's try to see if the sum x² + y² + z² can be larger than 657/16. Let me compute 657/16 = 41.0625.

Suppose I take another point where x =1, then y z =23. And from surface area, xy + yz + xz =27.

If x=1, then y + z + y z =27.

But if y z =23, then y + z =27 -23=4.

So, y + z=4 and y z=23. But wait, discriminant for y and z would be 16 - 92= -76, which is negative. So, no real solution. So, x=1 is not possible.

Similarly, trying x=3: then y z=23/3≈7.6667.

From surface area: 3y +3z + y z =27.

But y z=23/3, so 3(y + z) +23/3=27.

Multiply both sides by 3: 9(y + z) +23=81 → 9(y + z)=58 → y + z=58/9≈6.444.

So, y and z are roots of t^2 - (58/9) t +23/3=0.

Compute discriminant: (58/9)^2 -4*(23/3) = (3364/81) - (92/3) = (3364 - 92*27)/81.

Compute 92*27: 92*27= (90*27)+(2*27)=2430 +54=2484.

So, 3364-2484=880.

Thus, discriminant=880/81>0, so real roots exist.

So, y and z are real, positive numbers.

Now, let's compute x² + y² + z² =9 + y² + z².

But y² + z² = (y + z)^2 - 2 y z = (58/9)^2 -2*(23/3) = (3364/81) - (46/3) = (3364 - 46*27)/81.

Compute 46*27=1242.

So, 3364 -1242=2122.

Thus, y² + z²=2122/81.

So, x² + y² + z²=9 +2122/81 = (729 +2122)/81=2851/81≈35.1975.

Which is less than 41.0625, so the sum is smaller.

Hmm, so when x=3, the sum is about 35.1975, which is less than when x=y=2, z=5.75.

So, perhaps the maximum occurs at x=y=2, z=5.75.

Wait, but let me check another point. What if x= y= something else?

Wait, perhaps I can consider the case where x, y, z are all different, but it's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use some inequality to find the maximum.

Wait, we have:

From the surface area: xy + yz + xz =27.

We also have xyz=23.

I want to maximize x² + y² + z².

I recall that for positive real numbers, (x + y + z)^2 =x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz).

So, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + xz) = (x + y + z)^2 -54.

So, to maximize x² + y² + z², I need to maximize (x + y + z)^2, which is equivalent to maximizing x + y + z.

So, perhaps it's easier to maximize x + y + z, given the constraints.

So, let me denote S =x + y + z, P=xy + yz + xz=27, and V=xyz=23.
