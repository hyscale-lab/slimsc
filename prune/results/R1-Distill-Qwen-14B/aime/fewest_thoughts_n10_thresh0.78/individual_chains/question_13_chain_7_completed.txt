Alright, so I have this math problem about Aya's morning walk. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. Okay, let's read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks at 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same 't' minutes in the coffee shop. Now, they want to know how long the walk will take her if she walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, including the 't' minutes again.

Hmm, okay, so the key here is the relationship between her walking speed and the time she takes. The coffee shop time 't' is included in both scenarios, so it's a constant. So, the difference in total time is due to her walking speed.

Let me try to break this down. When she walks at speed 's', the total time is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes (since 4*60=240). But this includes 't' minutes in the coffee shop. So, the actual walking time is 240 - t minutes.

Similarly, when she walks at speed 's + 2', the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Wait, 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 144 minutes. So, the total time is 144 minutes, which includes 't' minutes. So, the walking time here is 144 - t minutes.

Wait, but maybe I should work in hours instead of minutes to keep the units consistent since speed is in km per hour. Let me think. Yeah, probably better to convert everything into hours.

So, 4 hours is 4 hours, and 2 hours 24 minutes is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours.

So, let's denote:

- At speed s km/h, total time is 4 hours. So, walking time is (4 - t/60) hours because t is in minutes. Wait, but maybe it's better to keep t in hours as well. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I should express the walking time in terms of t.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as:

Time taken to walk 9 km = (time without coffee) + coffee time.

Wait, but no, the problem says the total time she takes is including the coffee shop time. So, 4 hours includes the walking and the coffee. So, when she walks at speed s, her walking time is 4 hours minus t minutes. But to keep units consistent, perhaps I should convert everything to hours.

Wait, 4 hours is total, including t minutes. So, t minutes is t/60 hours. So, walking time when speed is s is (4 - t/60) hours.

Similarly, when she walks at s + 2, the total time is 2.4 hours. So, walking time is (2.4 - t/60) hours.

But wait, another approach is to model the walking time as 9 km divided by the speed. So, the walking time is 9/s hours when she walks at speed s. But this should equal the total time minus the coffee time.

Wait, but the total time is including the coffee time. So, the walking time is the total time minus the coffee time. So,

When speed is s:

Walking time = 9/s hours = total time (4 hours) - t minutes.

But t is in minutes, so to convert to hours, t minutes is t/60 hours. So,

9/s = 4 - (t/60)

Similarly, when speed is s + 2:

Walking time = 9/(s + 2) hours = total time (2.4 hours) - t/60 hours.

So,

9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

Now, we have two equations:

1) 9/s = 4 - t/60
2) 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60

We can solve these two equations to find s and t.

Let me write them again:

Equation 1: 9/s = 4 - t/60
Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60

So, I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t.

Wait, actually, let me express both equations in terms of 9/s and 9/(s + 2), then set up the system.

Alternatively, perhaps subtract the two equations:

Equation 1 minus Equation 2:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = (4 - t/60) - (2.4 - t/60) )

Simplify the right side:

4 - t/60 - 2.4 + t/60 = (4 - 2.4) + (-t/60 + t/60) = 1.6 + 0 = 1.6

So, left side:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Let me compute 9/s -9/(s + 2):

= [9(s + 2) - 9s] / [s(s + 2)]
= [9s + 18 - 9s] / [s(s + 2)]
= 18 / [s(s + 2)]

So,

18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

So, 18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

Let me compute 1.6 * s(s + 2) = 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s

So,

18 = 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s

Let me bring all terms to one side:

1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0

Hmm, working with decimals can be a bit messy. Maybe multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate decimals:

16 s^2 + 32 s - 180 = 0

Wait, no, wait: 1.6 * 10 = 16, 3.2 *10=32, 18*10=180, but since the original equation is 18 = 1.6s^2 +3.2s, so multiplying both sides by 10 gives 180 = 16s^2 +32s. Wait, no: 18*10=180, 1.6*10=16, 3.2*10=32.

Wait, actually, 1.6 s^2 +3.2 s = 18. So, 18 = 1.6 s^2 +3.2 s

So, 1.6 s^2 +3.2 s - 18 = 0.

Alternatively, to make it easier, maybe multiply by 5 to eliminate the decimal:

1.6 *5=8, 3.2*5=16, 18*5=90, so:

8 s^2 + 16 s - 90 = 0

Wait, 8s² +16s -90=0.

Now, this quadratic equation can be simplified. Let's see if all terms are divisible by 2:

4 s² + 8 s -45 =0.

Yes, that's better.

So, 4s² +8s -45=0.

Now, using the quadratic formula, s = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)] / (2a)

Here, a=4, b=8, c=-45.

So, discriminant D= b² -4ac= 64 -4*4*(-45)=64 +720=784.

sqrt(784)=28.

So,

s = [ -8 ±28 ] / (2*4) => [ (-8 +28)/8, (-8 -28)/8 ]

So,

s = (20)/8=2.5, or s=(-36)/8=-4.5.

Negative speed doesn't make sense, so s=2.5 km/h.

So, s=2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find t.

We can use equation 1: 9/s =4 - t/60

So, 9/(2.5) =4 - t/60

9/2.5 is 3.6.

So,

3.6 =4 - t/60

So, t/60=4 -3.6=0.4

So, t=0.4 *60=24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes.

So, now, the question is: at speed s + 1/2, which is 2.5 +0.5=3 km/h.

So, what is the total time, including t=24 minutes.

So, the walking time is 9 km at 3 km/h.

Walking time=9/3=3 hours.

So, total time including coffee is 3 hours +24 minutes.

Wait, but the problem says "the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop."

So, 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 204 minutes.

So, the answer is 204 minutes.

Wait, let me double-check.

At s=2.5 km/h, time taken is 9/2.5=3.6 hours, which is 3 hours and 36 minutes. Adding t=24 minutes, total time is 3h36m +24m=4h, which matches the problem statement.

Similarly, at s+2=4.5 km/h, walking time is 9/4.5=2 hours. Adding t=24 minutes, total time is 2h24m, which matches the problem statement.

So, the calculations seem correct.

So, when she walks at s+1/2=3 km/h, walking time is 3 hours, plus 24 minutes is 204 minutes total.


Aya's walking time at speed \( s \) km/h is given by \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours, and her total time including the coffee shop is 4 hours. Similarly, at speed \( s+2 \) km/h, her walking time is \( \frac{9}{s+2} \) hours, with a total time of 2 hours and 24 minutes (2.4 hours). Setting up the equations:

\[
\frac{9}{s} = 4 - \frac{t}{60}
\]
\[
\frac{9}{s+2} = 2.4 - \frac{t}{60}
\]

Subtracting the second equation from the first eliminates \( t \):

\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = 1.6
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{18}{s(s+2)} = 1.6 \implies 18 = 1.6s^2 + 3.2s
\]

Solving the quadratic equation:

\[
4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{784}}{8} = 2.5 \text{ km/h (since speed cannot be negative)}
\]

Substituting \( s = 2.5 \) into the first equation to find \( t \):

\[
\frac{9}{2.5} = 4 - \frac{t}{60} \implies 3.6 = 4 - \frac{t}{60} \implies t = 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

At speed \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h, the walking time is:

\[
\frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]

Including the coffee shop time, the total time is:

\[
180 + 24 = 204 \text{ minutes}
\]

The final answer is:

\boxed{204}
