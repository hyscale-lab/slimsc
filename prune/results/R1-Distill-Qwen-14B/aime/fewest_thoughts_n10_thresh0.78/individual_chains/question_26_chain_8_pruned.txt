Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again carefully to make sure I understand all the details.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We are given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then compute m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. We have triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. Tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, line AD intersects the circumcircle again at P. We need to find AP.

First, I should probably draw a diagram to get a better sense of the problem. But since there's an Asymptote figure provided, I can refer to that mentally. Point D is outside the circle, as it's the intersection of two tangents. Then, line AD passes through the circle again at P.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a common external point to a circle, the lengths from that point to the points of tangency are equal. So, in this case, DB and DC should be equal because both are tangents from D to ω. That might be useful.

Given the sides of triangle ABC, I can perhaps compute some angles or other lengths using the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines. But before that, maybe I should compute some key properties of triangle ABC, like its circumradius, since ω is the circumcircle.

Let's compute the circumradius R of triangle ABC. The formula for the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle and Δ is the area.

We have sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me assign these as a=BC=9, b=AC=10, c=AB=5. Wait, no, in standard notation, a is opposite angle A, so maybe I should assign a=BC=9, b=AC=10, c=AB=5.

Wait, no, actually, in standard triangle notation, side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, and side c opposite angle C. So, in triangle ABC:

- a = BC = 9 (opposite angle A)
- b = AC = 10 (opposite angle B)
- c = AB = 5 (opposite angle C)

Wait, that might be confusing. Let me just compute the area first using Heron's formula.

Heron's formula states that the area Δ is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter.

Compute s: (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

So, s = 12.

Then, Δ = sqrt[12(12 - 9)(12 - 10)(12 - 5)] = sqrt[12 * 3 * 2 * 7] = sqrt[504].

Simplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, actually, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which is not an integer. Let's factor 504:

504 = 8 * 63 = 8 * 9 * 7 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7
