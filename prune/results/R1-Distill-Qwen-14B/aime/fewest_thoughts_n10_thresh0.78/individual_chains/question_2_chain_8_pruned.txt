Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There are three points: O at (0,0), which is the origin; A at (1/2, 0), so that's on the x-axis halfway between O and (1,0); and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is on the y-axis a bit higher than halfway to (0,1). 

The problem mentions a family of segments PQ of unit length. Each PQ is a segment lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, these are all segments starting from some point P on the x-axis, going to some point Q on the y-axis, and the length of PQ is 1. 

So, for each such segment, P is (p,0) and Q is (0,q), and the distance between them is sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2) = 1. So, p^2 + q^2 = 1. And since they're in the first quadrant, p and q are positive.

Now, the family F consists of all such segments PQ. So, these are all possible unit segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. 

The problem states that there is a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. So, point C is on AB, and it's only on AB and no other PQ in F. Our goal is to find OC^2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C.

Let me think about the line AB first. Points A and B are given, so I can find the equation of line AB.

Point A is (1/2, 0) and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me calculate the slope of AB. Slope m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So, the equation of AB is y - 0 = m(x - 1/2). Plugging m, we get y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplify that: y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2).

So, parametric equations for AB can be written as well. Let me parameterize AB from A to B. Let parameter t go from 0 to 1. So, when t=0, we are at A, and t=1, we are at B.

So, the parametric equations would be x = (1/2)(1 - t) + 0*t = 1/2(1 - t), and y = 0*(1 - t) + (sqrt(3)/2)*t = (sqrt(3)/2) t. So, x = 1/2(1 - t) and y = (sqrt(3)/2) t.

So, any point C on AB can be expressed as (1/2(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t) for some t between 0 and 1. But C is not A or B, so t is between 0 and 1, exclusive.

Now, the key point is that C does not lie on any other segment PQ from F except AB. So, for C, it's the only point on AB that isn't covered by any other PQ in F. So, for all other PQ in F, if we have a segment PQ between (p,0) and (0,q), then the line PQ does not pass through C except when PQ is AB itself.

So, our goal is to find such a point C on AB. So, how can I find this point?

Perhaps, if I consider the envelope of all the segments PQ in F. The envelope is the curve that is tangent to all these segments. Since all PQ are unit segments from x-axis to y-axis, forming a family of lines, the envelope might be a curve that they all touch. Maybe this envelope is the line AB? But in the problem, it's stated that AB is a segment in F, so the envelope might be a different curve, but since point C is on AB and not on any other PQ, perhaps it's the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.

Wait, that might be a bit abstract. Let me think differently. For each point C on AB, except A and B, we can find if there's another PQ in F that passes through C. The point C that doesn't lie on any other PQ is the one where it's only on AB and nowhere else.

So, suppose we take a point C = (x, y) on AB. To check if it lies on any other PQ in F, we need to see if there exists a PQ with P=(p,0) and Q=(0,q) such that p^2 + q^2 = 1, and the line PQ passes through (x,y).

So, let's write the equation of line PQ. The line from (p, 0) to (0, q) can be written as (x/p) + (y/q) = 1. So, any point (x, y) on this line satisfies x/p + y/q = 1.

Now, since C is on AB, its coordinates satisfy y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2. So, for C=(x,y), we have y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, if C is on PQ, then x/p + y/q = 1. But since p^2 + q^2 = 1, perhaps we can express q in terms of p or vice versa.

Wait, but we can also think about this: for each point C not on AB, if it's on another PQ, then there exists p and q such that p^2 + q^2 = 1 and x/p + y/q = 1.

So, for a given C=(x,y), such that it's on AB, we can write y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. So, substituting into the line equation, we get x/p + [(-sqrt
