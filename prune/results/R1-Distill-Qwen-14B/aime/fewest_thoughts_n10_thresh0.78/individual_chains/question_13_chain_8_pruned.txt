Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walks. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the problem says that Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She goes at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, and this walk takes her 4 hours, but that time includes t minutes spent in a coffee shop. Then, when she walks a bit faster, at s + 2 kilometers per hour, her walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, which still includes t minutes in the coffee shop. Now, they're asking what the time would be if she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the t minutes again.

Hmm, so I think the key here is to set up some equations based on the information given. Let's break it down.

First, when she walks at speed s, the total time is 4 hours. But this includes both the time she spends walking and the time she spends in the coffee shop, which is t minutes. Similarly, when she walks at s + 2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is still including t minutes. So, the difference in total time must be due to the different walking speeds.

Wait, but how do I relate the walking time and the coffee shop time? Let me think. If I denote the walking time as Tw and the coffee shop time as Tc, then the total time T is Tw + Tc. In the first case, T is 4 hours, and in the second case, it's 2 hours and 24 minutes. So, Tc is t minutes in both cases, right?

But wait, the problem says that both total times include t minutes spent in the coffee shop. So, the difference in the total times must be because of the difference in walking time. That makes sense.

Let me convert everything into hours to make it consistent. I know that 1 hour is 60 minutes, so t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, for the first scenario: walking speed is s km/h, distance is 9 km. The time she spends walking is Tw1 = distance / speed = 9 / s hours. Then, the total time is Tw1 + Tc = 4 hours. Tc is t/60 hours, because t is in minutes. So, equation 1 is:

9/s + t/60 = 4.

Similarly, for the second scenario: walking speed is s + 2 km/h, so walking time Tw2 = 9 / (s + 2) hours. The total time is Tw2 + t/60 = 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert 24 minutes to hours: 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So 2.4 hours. So, equation 2 is:

9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4.

Now I have two equations:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4.

2) 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4.

I need to solve for s and t. Once I have s, I can find the time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

Let me denote t/60 as Tc for simplicity. So, equation 1 becomes:

9/s + Tc = 4 --> equation (1)

Equation 2 becomes:

9/(s + 2) + Tc = 2.4 --> equation (2)

If I subtract equation (2) from equation (1), I can eliminate Tc. Let's do that.

(9/s + Tc) - (9/(s + 2) + Tc) = 4 - 2.4
9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Let me simplify the left
