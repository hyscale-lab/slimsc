Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I have to find the smallest m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that if a prime p divides n⁴ + 1, certain conditions have to be met. I think it has something to do with the multiplicative order of n modulo p. Specifically, since n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, then squaring both sides gives n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p. So the order of n modulo p should divide 8. But since n⁴ ≡ -1, the order can't be less than 8. Therefore, the order must be exactly 8. That means 8 divides p-1, right? Because the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1, so 8 must divide p-1. So p ≡ 1 mod 8.

Wait, but the question isn't just about p dividing n⁴ +1, it's about p² dividing n⁴ +1. So I think I need to look into higher congruence conditions. Maybe Hensel's lemma or lifting the exponent? Alternatively, maybe using the concept of Wieferich primes, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about small primes first. The primes that are 1 mod 8 are 17, 97, etc. Wait, 17 is the first one after 2. But let me check primes less than 17 too, maybe they can also divide n⁴ +1.

Wait, primes like 2: Let's see. For p=2, n⁴ +1. If n is odd, n⁴ is 1 mod 2, so n⁴ +1 is 0 mod 2. But does 2² divide n⁴ +1? Let's see: n is odd, say n=1: 1 +1=2, which is 2 mod 4, so 2²=4 does not divide 2. n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2 mod 4. So 4 doesn't divide it. So p can't be 2.

Next, p=5. Let me see if 5 divides n⁴ +1 for some n. The residues mod 5 are 0,1,2,3,4. Let's compute n⁴ mod 5:

1⁴=1, 2⁴=16≡1, 3⁴=81≡1, 4⁴=256≡1. So n⁴ ≡1 mod 5 for any n not divisible by 5. So n⁴ +1 ≡2 mod 5. So 5 doesn't divide n⁴ +1, so p can't be 5.

What about p=17? Let's check if 17² divides n⁴ +1 for some n. Wait, first, does 17 divide n⁴ +1 for some n? Let's check n=4: 4⁴=256. 256 mod 17: 17*15=255, so 256≡1 mod 17. So 4⁴ +1=257≡2 mod17. Not zero. Hmm.

Wait, maybe n=13: 13⁴. Let me compute 13 mod17 is 13. 13²=169≡169-10*17=169-170=-1 mod17. So 13⁴=(
