Okay, so I have this problem where each vertex of a regular octagon is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. I need to find the probability that there exists some rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let's break this down. A regular octagon has 8 vertices, so each can be colored red or blue. The total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256. That's the denominator of my probability.

Now, the numerator is the number of colorings where there's a rotation that maps all blue vertices to the original red positions. Wait, what does that mean exactly? So, for a given coloring, if I can rotate the octagon (by 0°, 45°, 90°, etc.) such that every blue vertex in the new position was originally red. So, after rotation, all the blue ones are now in red spots, and vice versa.

Wait, actually, no. Let me think again. The problem says that after rotation, all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. So, each blue vertex must be moved to a position that was previously red. That suggests that in the original coloring, the set of blue points must be a rotation of the set of red points. Because if you can rotate the blue points to align with red points, then the set of blue points is just a rotated version of the red points.

So, another way of putting it: the set of blue vertices must be a translate (or rotation) of the set of red vertices. Since the octagon is regular, the automorphism group is the dihedral group, but since we're only considering rotations (not reflections), it's cyclic of order 8.

So, for a given coloring, we need that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. But wait, each color is determined by the other since the octagon has only two colors. So, if the blues
