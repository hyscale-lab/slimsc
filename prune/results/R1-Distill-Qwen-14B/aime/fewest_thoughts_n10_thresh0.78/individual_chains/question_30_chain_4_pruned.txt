Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000. Here, \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^{13} = 1\). So, these roots are \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 12\), where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i /13}\). Since \(\omega \neq 1\), we're excluding \(k=0\) or at least the root 1. Wait, but in the product, \(k\) goes from 0 to 12, so that includes all 13 roots, but since \(\omega^0 = 1\), maybe the term for \(k=0\) is still okay?

Let me compute the term when \(k=0\): \(2 - 2\omega^0 + \omega^{0}\). That simplifies to \(2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1\). So the first term is 1. So the entire product is 1 multiplied by the other terms from \(k=1\) to \(k=12\).

So, the product becomes \(\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\). Now, I need to compute this product. Hmm, perhaps I can factor something out or find a pattern.

Looking at each term \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\), maybe I can rewrite it in a different form. Let me see:

\(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2\). Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in \(\omega^k\). Let me treat \(\omega^k\) as a variable, say \(x\). Then the term becomes \(x^2 - 2x + 2\). So each term is \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) evaluated at \(x = \omega^k\).

Wait, so the product is \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2)\) where \(x = \omega^k\). Since \(\omega^k\) are all the 13th roots of unity except 1, maybe I can relate this to a polynomial whose roots are \(\omega^k\) for \(k=1\) to 12.

I recall that the minimal polynomial for the primitive 13th roots of unity is the 12th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \(\Phi_{13}(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \dots + x + 1\). So, perhaps I can use this.

But in our case, each term is \(x^2 - 2x + 2\). So maybe the product over all k=1 to 12 is equal to the product of \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) evaluated at each x = \(\omega^k\). So, that would be the product over k=1 to 12 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) where x = \(\omega^k\).

Wait, so that's equivalent to evaluating the product \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2)\) where each x is a primitive 13th root of unity. Alternatively, since the product of a function over all roots can be related to evaluating the function at each root and multiplying.

But I'm trying to find a way to compute this product. Maybe I can consider polynomials. If I think of the polynomial \(P(x) =
