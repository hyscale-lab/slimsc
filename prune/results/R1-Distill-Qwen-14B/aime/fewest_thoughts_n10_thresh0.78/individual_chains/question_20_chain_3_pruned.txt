Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out how many ways to place some chips on a 5x5 grid. The chips are either white or black, and there are 25 of each. Each cell can hold at most one chip. The conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for the columns. Also, once I place the chips, if I try to add any more, it should violate one of those two conditions. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, let me understand the problem. I have a 5x5 grid, so 25 cells. Each cell can be either white, black, or empty. But the constraints are that every row and every column must have chips of the same color if they're occupied. Also, the placement must be maximal, meaning I can't add any more chips without breaking the same-color rule in either a row or a column.

Wait, so each row can have either all white chips, all black chips, or no chips. Same for each column. But if a row has any chips, all the chips in that row must be the same color. Same for columns. But also, if I have any empty cell, adding a chip there would require that the entire row and column of that cell to be of the same color as that chip. But maybe that's not the case? No, actually, the additional chip can only be placed if all the chips in its row and column are of the same color. So the current arrangement must prevent that, meaning that every empty cell is such that either its row already has chips of mixed colors (which can't happen because all chips in a row must be same color) or its column already has chips of mixed colors. But since each row and column can only have one color or be empty, the only way adding a chip is prevented is if the row or column is already occupied (i.e., has at least one chip) and that row or column is not empty. Wait, no, because each row and column can have at most one color, so if the row is non-empty, all its chips are the same color, and similarly for the column.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me restate the problem: Each cell can have at most one chip. All chips in the same row must be same color, same for columns. Additionally, the current placement is such that adding any additional chip would violate the previous two conditions
