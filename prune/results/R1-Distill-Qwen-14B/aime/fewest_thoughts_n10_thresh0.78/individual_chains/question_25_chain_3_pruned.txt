Okay, so I've got this problem here about Aimeville's residents and the things they own. Let's see, the question is asking for the number of people who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, okay. 

Let me jot down the given numbers. There are 900 residents in total. Out of these:

- 195 own a diamond ring (let's call this D)
- 367 own golf clubs (G)
- 562 own a garden spade (S)
- All 900 own a bag of candy hearts (C). So C is universal here.

Additionally, we know that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, our goal is to find how many own all four.

Hmm, okay, this sounds like a problem where I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps in counting the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by considering intersections. But since we have some info about exactly two and exactly three, maybe we can model it using Venn diagrams or set equations.

Wait, let me recall that formula. For four sets, A, B, C, D, the inclusion-exclusion principle is a bit more complicated, but maybe I don't need all that here. Let me think about what's given.

We have four items, so four sets: D, G, S, C. But C is universal because all 900 own it. So every resident is in C. That might simplify things a bit because we can think of the other sets (D, G, S) as subsets of C.

Let me denote:

n(D) = 195

n(G) = 367

n(S) = 562

n(C) = 900

Number of people owning exactly two things: 437

Number owning exactly three things: 234

We need to find the number owning all four, which is n(D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C). But since C includes everyone, this is just n(D ∩ G ∩ S). So, we're looking for the intersection of D, G, and S.

Hmm, okay. So let me think about how inclusion-exclusion works for three sets. The formula for three sets is:

n(D ∪ G ∪ S) = n(D) + n(G) + n(S) - n(D∩G) - n(D∩S) - n(G∩S) + n(D∩G∩S)

But wait, we also know that everyone owns C, so the union of D, G, S is within C, which might help. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach it by considering the total number of items owned and how they are distributed.

Wait, another approach. Let me consider the total number of people and the number of items they own.

Each person can own 1, 2, 3, or 4 items. We know the counts for exactly two and exactly three, but we need the count for exactly four.

Wait, let me denote:

Let x be the number of people who own exactly one item.

Let y = 437 be the number owning exactly two.

Let z = 234 be the number owning exactly three.

Let w be the number owning all four.

We know that total residents are x + y + z + w = 900.

But I don't know x yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the total number of items owned across all residents.

Each resident contributes to the count based on how many items they own. So, the total number of items is:

Sum = (number of D owners) + (number of G owners) + (number of S owners)
