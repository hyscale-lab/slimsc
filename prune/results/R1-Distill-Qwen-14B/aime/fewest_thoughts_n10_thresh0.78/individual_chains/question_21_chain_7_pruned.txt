Okay, so I've got this math problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to understand what it's asking for.

The problem says that for an integer b ≥ 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, n must have exactly two digits when written in base b. Second, the sum of these two digits should equal the square root of n. 

An example is given: 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. So that makes sense.

The task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, we need to find the smallest base b where there are over ten numbers n that satisfy the given conditions.

Let me break down the problem.

First, understanding what it means for a number n to have exactly two digits in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number would be of the form d₁d₀, where d₁ and d₀ are digits in base b. That means d₁ can range from 1 to b-1 (since the first digit can't be zero), and d₀ can range from 0 to b-1.

So, the value of n in base 10 would be n = d₁ * b + d₀.

Now, the sum of the digits is d₁ + d₀, and this sum should equal sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) = d₁ + d₀.

Since sqrt(n) must be an integer (because d₁ and d₀ are integers), n must be a perfect square. Let's denote s = d₁ + d₀, so s must be an integer, and n = s².

So, putting it all together, we have n = d₁ * b + d₀ = s², and s = d₁ + d₀.

Therefore, substituting s into the equation, we get:

d₁ * b + d₀ = (d₁ + d₀)².

Let me write that equation again:

d₁ * b + d₀ = (d₁ + d₀)².

Let me rearrange this equation to solve for b. Let's denote:

Let’s define s = d₁ + d₀. Then, n = s² = d₁ * b + d₀.

So, s² = d₁ * b + d₀.

But since d₀ = s - d₁ (because s = d₁ + d₀), we can substitute that into the equation:

s² = d₁ * b + (s - d₁).

Simplify that:

s² = d₁ * b + s - d₁.

Let's bring all terms to one side:

d₁ * b = s² - s + d₁.

Factor out d₁ on the right side:

d₁ * b = d₁ + (s² - s).

Then, factor out d₁:

d₁ * (b - 1) = s² - s.

So,

d₁ = (s² - s) / (b - 1).

But we also know that d₁ is a digit in base b, so d₁ must satisfy 1 ≤ d₁ ≤ b - 1. Similarly, d₀ = s - d₁ must satisfy 0 ≤ d₀ ≤ b - 1.

Therefore, for given s, d₁ must be an integer between 1 and b-1, and d₀ must also be an integer between 0 and b-1.

So, for each base b, we can consider possible s and see if d₁ is an integer and within the required range.

But perhaps another approach is better. Let's think in terms of s and d₁.

From the equation:

d₁ = (s² - s) / (b - 1).

Since d₁ must be an integer, (s² - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). So, (b - 1) must be a divisor of (s² - s).

Additionally, since d₁ must be at least 1 and at most b-1, we have:

1 ≤ (s² - s)/(b - 1) ≤ b - 1.

Which can be rewritten as:

1 ≤ (s² - s)/(b - 1) ≤ b - 1.

Let me consider this inequality. Let's denote k = b - 1 for simplicity, so k ≥ 1 (since b ≥ 2).

Then, the inequality becomes:

1 ≤ (s² - s)/k ≤ k.

Which implies:

k ≤ s² - s ≤ k².

So, for each k, we can find s such that k ≤ s² - s ≤ k².

But k is equal to b - 1, so for each k, we can find s such that k ≤ s² - s ≤ k².

Wait, but s is related to d₁ and d₀, which are digits in base b.

So, we must also have that d₀ = s - d₁ is between 0 and b - 1, i.e., 0 ≤ s - d₁ ≤ b - 1.

But d₁ is (s² - s)/k, so:

0 ≤ s - (s² - s)/k ≤ b - 1.

But b = k + 1, so:

0 ≤ s - (s² - s)/k ≤ k.

Let me compute the lower bound first:

s - (s² - s)/k ≥ 0.

Multiply both sides by k (positive since k ≥1):

s*k - (s² - s) ≥ 0.

=> s*k - s² + s ≥ 0.

Factor s:

s*(k - s + 1) ≥ 0.

Since s is a positive integer (as it's the sum of two digits: d₁ ≥1, d₀ ≥0, so s ≥1).

Therefore, the expression s*(k - s +1) ≥ 0 implies that (k - s +1) ≥ 0, since s is positive.

Therefore:

k - s +1 ≥0 => s ≤ k +1.

Similarly, the upper bound:

s - (s² - s)/k ≤ k.

Multiply both sides by k:

s*k - (
