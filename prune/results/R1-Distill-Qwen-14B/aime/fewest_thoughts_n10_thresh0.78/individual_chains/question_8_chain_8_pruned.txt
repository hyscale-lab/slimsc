Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward—it tells me that the sum of the three variables is 300. The second equation is a bit more complex: it's a sum of terms where each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another. Let me write that more clearly:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, I notice that each term is symmetric in two variables. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let's see:

Looking at the terms, I can factor out, for example, a² from the first two terms:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Since a + b + c = 300, I can express b + c as 300 - a, a + c as 300 - b, and a + b as 300 - c. Let me substitute these into the equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Expanding each term:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Combine like terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's better. Now, I have an equation involving a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³. Maybe I can find a way to relate these terms to the sum a + b + c.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c is 300, let's compute that square:

300² = 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).

So, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca). Let me write that as equation (1):

Equation (1): a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

Wait, maybe I can also express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of other symmetric sums. I recall that a³ + b³ + c³ can be written as (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. Let me double-check that formula.

Yes, the identity is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, plugging in a + b + c = 300:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Compute 300³: 300*300=90,000; 90,000*300=27,000,000. So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Let me denote S = ab + bc + ca and P = abc. Then,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900S + 3P.

Now, going back to the earlier equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

From equation (1), substitute a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2S:

300*(90,000 - 2S) - (27,000,000 - 900S + 3P) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each term:

300*(90,000) = 27,000,000
300*(-2S) = -600S
So the first part is 27,000,000 - 600S.

Subtracting the second part: -27,000,000 + 900S - 3P.

Putting it all together:

(27,000,000 - 600S) - (27,000,000 - 900S + 3P) = 6,000,000.

Simplify the left side:

27,000,000 -600S -27,000,000 +900S -3P = 6,000,000.

The 27,000,000 terms cancel out:

(-600
