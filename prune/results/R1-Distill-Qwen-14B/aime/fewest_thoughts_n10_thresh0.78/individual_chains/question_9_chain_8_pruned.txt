Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product of two real numbers, x and y, both greater than 1. The given conditions are:

log_x(y^x) = 10

and

log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Hmm, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can use some logarithm properties to simplify these expressions.

Let me recall some logarithm rules. The logarithm log_b(a) is equal to (ln a)/(ln b), right? Or, more generally, log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a.

So, maybe I can rewrite both equations using exponents.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Using the definition of logarithms, this means that x^10 = y^x.

Similarly, for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. So, y^10 = x^{4y}.

So now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but perhaps I can find a relationship between x and y.

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides of both equations to bring down the exponents.

For the first equation, ln(x^10) = ln(y^x).

That simplifies to 10 ln x = x ln y.

Similarly, for the second equation, ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y}).

Which becomes 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

So now I have:

Equation A: 10 ln x = x ln y

Equation B: 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Hmm. So, if I have two equations with ln x and ln y, maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of the other.

Let me see if I can express ln y in terms of ln x from Equation A.

From Equation A:

10 ln x = x ln y

So, ln y = (10 ln x)/x.

Now, plug this into Equation B.

Equation B: 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

Substitute ln y:

10*(10 ln x / x) = 4y ln x.

Simplify left side: 100 ln x / x = 4y ln x.

Hmm, I can divide both sides by ln x, assuming ln x is not zero, which it isn't because x > 1, so ln x is positive.

So, 100 / x = 4y.

Simplify this: 100/(4x) = y => y = 25 / x.

Wait, so y = 25/x.

Interesting. So, now I can express y in terms of x. Let's plug this back into one of the earlier equations to solve for x.

Let's go back to Equation A: 10 ln x = x ln y.

But since y = 25/x, let's substitute that in.

So, ln y = ln(25/x) = ln 25 - ln x.

So, Equation A becomes:

10 ln x = x (ln 25 - ln x).

Let's write that out:

10 ln x = x ln 25 - x ln x.

Bring all terms to one side:

10 ln x + x ln x - x ln 25 = 0.

Factor out ln x:

ln x (10 + x) - x ln 25 = 0.

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe we can rearrange terms.

Let me factor out ln x:

ln x (10 + x) = x ln 25.

So,

ln x = (x ln 25)/(10 + x).

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe I can express this as:

ln x = x ln 25 / (x + 10).

Alternatively, maybe we can let t = x, and write:

ln t = (t ln 25)/(t + 10).

This seems transcendental, meaning it's not solvable with elementary algebra. Maybe I can take exponentials of both sides to simplify.

Exponentiate both sides:

t = e^{(t ln 25)/(t +10)}.

Simplify the exponent:

e^{(t ln25)/(t+10)} = 25^{t/(t +10)}.

So, t = 25^{t/(t +10)}.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I can take the natural log again.

Wait, but I just took the exponent. Alternatively, let me denote u = t/(t +10).

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can write 25 as 5^2, so:

t = (5^2)^{t/(t +10)} =5^{2t/(t +10)}.

So,

t =5^{(2t)/(t +10)}.

Hmm, I'm not sure if this helps. Maybe I can take logs again.

ln t = (2t/(t +10)) ln5.

Wait, but that's similar to what I had before. Let me see:

From t =5^{(2t)/(t +10)}, taking ln:

ln t = (2t/(t +10)) ln5.

So,

ln t = (2t ln5)/(t + 10).

But earlier, I had ln t = (t ln25)/(t +10). Let me check that.

Wait, ln25 is 2 ln5, so yes, that's consistent. So, same equation.

So, ln t = (2t ln5)/(t + 10).

Hmm, maybe I can rearrange this equation.

Let me write:

(ln t)/(t) = (2 ln5)/(t +10).

So,

(ln t)/t = (2 ln5)/(
