Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all rhombuses ABCD on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. The diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. Hmm, rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and the rhombus is formed such that each diagonal passes through the origin.

First, let's recall some properties of rhombuses. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. But wait, no, that's only for a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but wait, yes, they are. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's correct. So, the diagonals intersect at right angles.

Wait, but in this problem, the hyperbola is given, so perhaps the points have to satisfy certain symmetries.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points are arranged such that if point A is (x, y), then the opposite point C would be (-x, -y), because the diagonals bisect each other at the origin. Similarly, the other two points B and D would be symmetric with respect to the origin as well.

But since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, so AB = BC = CD = DA.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to consider the coordinates of the four points. Let's denote the four points as A, B, C, D. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and it's a rhombus, the points must be arranged such that A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal.

So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C, and so on.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider the vectors of the diagonals. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, perhaps we can model the points as vectors.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, but their lengths can vary. So, perhaps the diagonals are vectors along certain lines, intersecting at the origin, perpendicular to each other.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to parameterize the points on the hyperbola.

Given the hyperbola equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, so any point on the hyperbola can be represented as (a√20 secθ, b√24 tanθ), where a² is 20 and b² is 24, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Alternatively, since the hyperbola is symmetric, perhaps we can consider points in terms of parametric equations.

Wait, another thought: since the origin is the midpoint of the diagonals, the coordinates of A and C are negatives of each other, and same with B and D. So, A = (x, y), C = (-x, -y), B = (u, v), D = (-u, -v). So, the four points are (x, y), (u, v), (-x, -y), (-u, -v).

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distances AB, BC, CD, DA are equal.

So, let's compute AB²: (x - u)² + (y - v)².

Similarly, BC²: (u + x)^2 + (v + y)^2.

CD²: (-x + u)^2 + (-y + v)^2.

DA²: (-u - x)^2 + (-v - y)^2.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm computing this correctly.

Point A is (x, y), point B is (u, v). So AB is the distance between (x, y) and (u, v): √[(x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2], so AB² is (x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2.

Similarly, BC is between (u, v) and (-x, -y): √[(u + x)^2 + (v + y)^2], so BC² is (u + x)^2 + (v + y)^2.

Similarly, CD is between (-x, -y) and (-u, -v): √[(-x + u)^2 + (-y + v)^2], so CD² is (u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2, which is same as AB².

Wait, so CD² equals AB². Similarly, DA is between (-u, -v) and (x, y): √[(x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2], so DA² is (x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2, which is same as BC².

So, for ABCD to be a rhombus, AB² = BC².

So,

(x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2 = (u + x)^2 + (v + y)^2.

Let me expand both sides:

Left side: (x² - 2xu + u²) + (y² - 2yv + v²) = x² + y² + u² + v² - 2xu - 2yv.

Right side: (u² + 2xu + x²) + (v² + 2yv + y²) = x² + y² + u² + v² + 2xu + 2yv.

Set them equal:

x² + y² + u² + v² - 2xu - 2yv = x² + y² + u² + v² + 2xu + 2yv.

Subtracting the same terms from both sides:

-2xu -2yv = 2xu + 2yv

Bring all terms to left:

-2xu -2yv -2xu -2yv = 0 → -4xu -4yv = 0 → 4xu + 4yv = 0 → xu + yv = 0.

So, the condition is xu + yv = 0.

That's one equation.

Now, the points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, so:

For point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

For point B: u²/20 - v²/24 = 1.

So, we have two equations:

1. xu + yv = 0.

2. x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

3. u²/20 - v²/24 = 1.

We also know that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular.

Wait, wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not only perpendicular but also bisect each other at 90 degrees. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.

So, vector AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y), but wait, actually, AC is from A (x,y) to C (-x,-y), so the vector is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, vector BD is from B (u, v) to D (-u, -v), vector is (-2u, -2v).

Wait, but the diagonals are AC and BD. So, vectors AC and BD.

Wait, the diagonals are AC and BD, so their vectors are AC = C - A = (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y), and BD = D - B = (-u - u, -v - v) = (-2u, -2v).

So, the vectors are AC = (-2x, -2y) and BD = (-2u, -2v). So, their dot product should be zero.

So, AC · BD = (-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 4xu + 4yv = 0.

Wait, but from earlier, we have xu + yv = 0, so 4xu + 4yv = 0 is just 4 times that, which is zero. So, that condition is already satisfied, so that doesn't give us any new information.

Hmm, so perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider the slopes of the diagonals. Since they are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1.

The slope of AC: from A (x,y) to C (-x,-y). The slope is (-y - y)/(-x - x) = (-2y)/(-2x) = y/x.

Similarly, the slope of BD: from B (u, v) to D (-u, -v). Slope is (-v - v)/(-u - u) = (-2v)/(-2u) = v/u.

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1:

(y/x) * (v/u) = -1.

So, (yv)/(xu) = -1 → yv = -xu.

Which is consistent with our earlier condition xu + yv = 0.

So, that's the same as xu + yv = 0.

So, that's the same condition. So, that doesn't add anything new.

Hmm, so perhaps I need to find another condition. Maybe using the fact that all sides are equal.

Wait, but I already considered that AB² = BC², which gave me xu + yv = 0.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the relation between x, y, u, v using the hyperbola equations.

Let me write down the hyperbola equations.

Point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Point B: u²/20 - v²/24 = 1.

So, from these, I can express x² and u² in terms of y² and v².

x² = 20(1 + y²/24) = 20 + (5/6)y².

Similarly, u² = 20(1 + v²/24) = 20 + (5/6)v².

Now, from xu + yv = 0, I can express maybe one variable in terms of others.

Let me solve for u: u = (-yv)/x.

Hmm, substituting into the equation for u².

u² = 20 + (5/6)v².

But u = (-yv)/x, so u² = (y² v²)/(x²).

Thus:

(y² v²)/(x²) = 20 + (5/6)v².

But x² from point A is 20 + (5/6)y².

So, substituting:

(y² v²)/(20 + (5/6) y²) = 20 + (5/6) v².

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but let's try to write it:

Multiply both sides by (20 + (5/6)y²):

y² v² = [20 + (5/6) v²] * [20 + (5/6)y²].

Hmm, that looks complicated, but maybe we can find a relation between y and v.

Let me denote a = y², b = v².

Then, the equation becomes:

a b = (20 + (5/6) b)(20 + (5/6) a).

Let's expand the right side:

= 20 * 20 + 20*(5/6) a + (5/6) b * 20 + (5/6)^2 a b.

= 400 + (100/6)a + (100/6) b + (25/36) a b.

So, the equation is:

a b = 400 + (100/6)(a + b) + (25/36) a b.

Bring all terms to left:

a b - 400 - (100/6)(a + b) - (25/36) a b = 0.

Combine like terms.

The terms with a b:

1 a b - (25/36) a b = (36/36 - 25/36) a b = (11/36) a b.

The terms with a and b:

- (100/6)(a + b) = - (50/3)(a + b).

Constants:

-400.

So, equation becomes:

(11/36) a b - (50/3)(a + b) - 400 = 0.

Multiply both sides by 36 to eliminate denominators:

11 a b - 600 (a + b) - 14400 = 0.

Hmm, 36*(50/3) is 36*(50)/3 = 12*50=600.

So, equation is:

11 a b - 600 a - 600 b -14400 = 0.

Hmm, perhaps factor this equation.

Let me write it as:

11 a b -600 a -600 b = 14400.

Hmm, maybe we can add 600²/11 to both sides to complete the rectangle.

Alternatively, perhaps factor it as:

11 a b -600 a -600 b =14400.

Let me factor terms:

a (11 b -600) -600 b = 14400.

Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, factor:

11 a b -600 a -600 b =14400.

Let me add 600² /11 to both sides to make it factorable. Wait, 600² is 360000, so 360000/11 is approximately, but perhaps not helpful.

Wait, maybe we can write it as:

11 a b -600 a -600 b = 14400.

Let me factor 11:

11(a b) -600(a + b) =14400.

Hmm, perhaps let me divide both sides by 11:

a b - (600/11)(a + b) = 14400/11.

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe express in terms of (a - c)(b - d) = e.

Alternatively, perhaps let me set s = a + b, p = a b.

Then, the equation is:

11 p -600 s =14400.

But we need another equation to relate s and p, but we don't have one. So, maybe this approach isn't working.

Wait, perhaps from the condition xu + yv =0, with u = (-y v)/x, and then from the hyperbola equation, we can get another equation.

Wait, maybe another approach.

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, and they intersect at the origin, perhaps we can parametrize the points A and B on the hyperbola such that the lines OA and OB are perpendicular.

Wait, but OA is from origin to A, and OB from origin to B, but in the rhombus, OA and OB are not the diagonals, but the diagonals are AC and BD, which pass through the origin.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the diagonals as vectors. Let me consider that.

Let me denote vector AC as vector d1 = ( -2x, -2y ), and vector BD as vector d2 = (-2u, -2v).

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, d1 · d2 = 0.

So, (-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 0 → 4xu +4yv =0 → xu + yv =0, which is consistent with earlier.

So, perhaps I can parametrize the points A and B such that their coordinates satisfy xu + yv =0, and their hyperbola equations.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use parametric equations for the hyperbola.

The hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 =1 can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions as:

x = √20 coshθ, y = √24 sinhθ.

Because cosh²θ - sinh²θ =1, so x²/20 - y²/24 = (20 cosh²θ)/20 - (24 sinh²θ)/24 = cosh²θ - sinh²θ =1.

So, that works. So, point A can be (√20 coshθ, √24 sinhθ).

Similarly, point B can be (√20 coshφ, √24 sinhφ).

But since point B is another point on the hyperbola, and since xu + yv =0.

So, for points A and B:

x =√20 coshθ, y=√24 sinhθ,

u=√20 coshφ, v=√24 sinhφ.

So, xu + yv =0,

So:

√20 coshθ * √20 coshφ + √24 sinhθ * √24 sinhφ = 0.

Simplify:

(20) coshθ coshφ + (24) sinhθ sinhφ = 0.

Divide both sides by 4:

5 coshθ coshφ + 6 sinhθ sinhφ =0.

Hmm, that's an equation relating θ and φ.

Let me write this as:

5 coshθ coshφ = -6 sinhθ sinhφ.

Divide both sides by coshθ coshφ (assuming coshθ and coshφ are non-zero, which they are):

5 = -6 (sinhθ sinhφ)/(coshθ coshφ) ) → 5 = -6 tanhθ tanhφ.

So,

tanhθ tanhφ = -5/6.

Hmm, that's a useful relation.

So, tanhθ tanhφ = -5/6.

Now, I need to find BD².

BD is the length of the diagonal from B to D.

But since the diagonals intersect at the origin, BD is the distance from B to D, which is 2 times the distance from B to the origin, because D is the reflection of B.

Wait, no, BD is the length of the diagonal, which is from B to D, which is from (u, v) to (-u, -v). So, the distance is sqrt[(-u -u)^2 + (-v -v)^2] = sqrt[(-2u)^2 + (-2v)^2] = sqrt[4u² +4v²] = 2 sqrt(u² + v²).

So, BD² is 4(u² + v²).

So, BD² =4 (u² + v²).

Similarly, AC² would be 4(x² + y²).

Since the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombuses, I need to find the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD², but wait, no, wait.

Wait, the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, that would be the infimum of BD², because we're looking for the maximum lower bound that is less than BD² for all rhombuses.

So, perhaps BD² can get arbitrarily large, but there is a minimum value, and we need to find the greatest number less than BD², which would be the infimum.

Wait, but let's make sure.

Wait, the problem is to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombuses. So, that number must be less than or equal to BD² for every possible rhombus.

So, that would be the infimum of BD² across all possible rhombuses. Because the infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, if BD² can be as small as possible, then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombuses would be the infimum.

Wait, but perhaps BD² has a minimum value, so the greatest number less than BD² would be that minimum value, as the lower bound.

Wait, perhaps I should find the minimum possible BD² over all such rhombuses. Then, that minimum would be the infimum, and the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombuses would be that minimum.

Wait, but let me check: if BD² can take any value from some minimum upwards, then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombuses would be the minimum, because if BD² can be as small as m, then any number greater than m would not satisfy being less than BD² for all rhombuses (since some BD² = m, which is less than that number). But if the number is m, then it's less than or equal to all BD². Wait, but the problem says "less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, perhaps the infimum is the limit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed.

So, BD² is 4(u² + v²). So, to minimize BD², we need to minimize u² + v².

Given that point B is on the hyperbola, so u²/20 - v²/24 =1. So, u² =20(1 + v²/24).

So, u² + v² =20 + (20 v²)/24 + v² =20 + (5/6)v² + v² =20 + (11/6)v².

So, to minimize u² + v², we need to minimize (11/6)v², which occurs when v² is as small as possible.

But v² cannot be negative, so the minimum is when v² approaches 0.

But if v² approaches 0, then from the hyperbola equation, u²/20 =1 → u²=20 → u=±2√5, and v=0.

So, point B would be at (±2√5, 0), and point D would be at (∓2√5, 0).

So, BD would be the distance from (2√5, 0) to (-2√5, 0), which is 4√5, so BD² = (4√5)^2 = 16*5=80.

Wait, but wait: in that case, the rhombus would have points A and C on the hyperbola, but if B is at (2√5, 0), then what is point A?

Wait, the condition xu + yv =0.

If u=2√5, v=0, then xu + yv = x*2√5 + y*0 = 2√5 x =0 → x=0.

But x=0 would imply from the hyperbola equation x²/20 - y²/24=1 that -y²/24=1 → y²=-24, which is impossible.

So, that's a contradiction. So, point B cannot be at (2√5, 0) because that would require point A to have x=0, which is impossible on the hyperbola.

So, the minimal BD² is not 80.

So, perhaps the minimal BD² is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should express u² + v² in terms of the hyperbola and the condition xu + yv =0.

From point A: x²/20 - y²/24 =1.

From point B: u²/20 - v²/24 =1.

From xu + yv=0 → yv = -xu.

Let me try to express u in terms of x and v, or something like that.

Another approach: Let me consider that points A and B lie on the hyperbola and satisfy xu + yv=0.

We can parameterize points A and B using hyperbola parametrization.

Earlier, I tried using hyperbolic functions, which led to tanhθ tanhφ = -5/6.

Alternatively, perhaps using rectangular coordinates.

Wait, another idea: Let me express BD² in terms of u and v, and then relate u and v through the condition xu + yv=0 and the hyperbola equations.

Wait, from xu + yv=0, and points A and B on hyperbola, perhaps we can find an expression for u and v in terms of x and y, or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers to minimize u² + v² subject to the hyperbola constraint and xu + yv=0, but that might be complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can express u and v in terms of x and y.

From xu + yv=0 → v = (-xu)/y.

Substitute into point B's hyperbola equation:

u²/20 - v²/24 =1 → u²/20 - (x² u²)/(y² *24) )=1.

Factor u²:

u² [1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²)] =1.

So,

u² = 1 / [1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²)].

But from point A's hyperbola equation: x²/20 - y²/24=1 → x² =20(1 + y²/24) =20 + (5/6)y².

So, substitute x² into the expression for u²:

u² = 1 / [1/20 - (20 + (5/6)y²)/(24 y²)].

Let me compute the denominator:

Denominator D = 1/20 - [20 + (5/6)y²]/(24 y²).

Compute each term:

1/20 is 0.05.

[20 + (5/6)y²]/(24 y²) can be split into 20/(24 y²) + (5/6)y²/(24 y²).

Simplify:

20/(24 y²) = (5)/(6 y²).

(5/6)y²/(24 y²) = (5)/(6*24) =5/(144).

So, D = 1/20 - [5/(6 y²) +5/144].

Wait, let me compute that:

D = (1/20) - [ (5)/(6 y²) + 5/(144) ]

Hmm, perhaps it's better to write all terms with a common denominator.

Let me find a common denominator for all terms. Let's say 1440 y².

But perhaps that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, let me write D as:

D = [1/20] - [5/(6 y²) +5/144].

= 1/20 -5/(6 y²) -5/144.

Combine constants:

1/20 -5/144 = (144 - 5*20)/(20*144) = (144 - 100)/2880 =44/2880 =11/720.

So, D=11/720 -5/(6 y²).

So, u² = 1/[11/720 -5/(6 y²)].

Now, this expression must be positive, so denominator must be positive.

So,

11/720 -5/(6 y²) >0 → 11/720 >5/(6 y²).

Multiply both sides by 720 y² (positive, so inequality remains same):

11 y² >5 * 120 → 11 y² >600 → y²>600/11 ≈54.545.

So, y² must be greater than 600/11.

So, the minimal value of y² is 600/11, and so the minimal value of u² can be found when y²=600/11.

Wait, but let me check: if y² approaches 600/11 from above, then denominator approaches zero from positive side, so u² approaches infinity. So, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let's go back.

From D =1/20 - [ (20 + (5/6)y² )/(24 y²) ].

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake when breaking down [20 + (5/6)y²]/(24 y²).

Let me re-calculate:

[20 + (5/6)y²]/(24 y²) = 20/(24 y²) + (5/6)y²/(24 y²).

= (5/(6 y²)) + (5)/(6*24).

=5/(6 y²) +5/144.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, D =1/20 -5/(6 y²) -5/144.

Which is D =1/20 -5/(6 y²) -5/144.

Now, let me compute 1/20 -5/144:

1/20 is 7.2/144,

5/144 is 5/144,

So, 7.2/144 -5/144 =2.2/144=11/720.

Wait, 7.2-5=2.2, and 2.2=11/5, so 2.2/144= (11/5)/144=11/(5*144)=11/720.

So, D=11/720 -5/(6 y²).

Thus, u²=1/[11/720 -5/(6 y²)].

Hmm, so for u² to be real and positive, the denominator must be positive.

So,

11/720 -5/(6 y²) >0 → 11/720 >5/(6 y²).

Multiply both sides by 720 y² (positive):

11 y² >5 * 120 → 11 y²>600 → y²>600/11.

So, y² must be greater than 600/11≈54.545.

So, the minimal possible y² is just above 600/11.

So, the minimal u² occurs when y² approaches 600/11 from above, making the denominator approach zero, so u² approaches infinity. That's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe we can find a relation between u² and v², and minimize u² +v².

From the condition xu + yv=0, and points A and B on the hyperbola.

Alternatively, perhaps using the parametrization with θ and φ, where tanhθ tanhφ = -5/6.

So, using the hyperbola parametrization:

x =√20 coshθ,

y=√24 sinhθ,

u=√20 coshφ,

v=√24 sinhφ.

And tanhθ tanhφ =-5/6.

We can express tanhφ= (-5/6)/tanhθ.

So, tanhφ= (-5)/(6 tanhθ).

We can write this as sinhφ/coshφ = (-5)/(6 tanhθ).

But tanhθ = sinhθ/coshθ.

So,

sinhφ/coshφ = (-5)/(6 (sinhθ/coshθ)) )= (-5 coshθ)/(6 sinhθ).

So,

sinhφ = (-5 coshθ)/(6 sinhθ) * coshφ.

Hmm, perhaps using hyperbolic identities.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps express coshφ and sinhφ in terms of θ.

But this might get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps use the identity cosh²φ - sinh²φ=1.

Let me denote t = tanhθ.

Then tanhφ= -5/(6 t).

Now, since tanhθ = t, we can express coshθ and sinhθ in terms of t.

We have coshθ=1/√(1 -t²), sinhθ= t/√(1 -t²).

Similarly, coshφ=1/√(1 - (25)/(36 t²)), and sinhφ= (-5)/(6 t)/√(1 -25/(36 t²)).

Wait, that's getting complicated, but let's see.

Wait, let me compute u² + v².

u² + v²=20 cosh²φ +24 sinh²φ.

=20 cosh²φ +24 sinh²φ.

Using the identity cosh²φ=1 + sinh²φ,

So,

=20(1 + sinh²φ) +24 sinh²φ=20 +44 sinh²φ.

So, u² +v²=20 +44 sinh²φ.

So, BD²=4(u² +v²)=4*(20 +44 sinh²φ)=80 +176 sinh²φ.

Hmm, so BD² is expressed in terms of sinh²φ.

Now, our goal is to find the minimal value of BD². So, we need to minimize sinh²φ.

But sinh²φ is non-negative, so the minimal value would be when sinh²φ is as small as possible.

But sinh²φ can't be negative, so the minimal value is 0, but that would require sinhφ=0 → φ=0, but then tanhφ=0, which would require tanhθ to be undefined (since tanhφ= -5/(6 tanhθ) → 0= -5/(6 tanhθ) → tanhθ approaches infinity, which would imply θ approaches infinity, which would make coshθ and sinhθ approach infinity, but maybe that's possible.

Wait, but let me check when φ=0, which implies sinhφ=0, so v=0. Then, from xu + yv=0, we have xu=0. Since x is from the hyperbola, x can't be zero (since x²/20 - y²/24=1 would imply y² negative if x=0). So, that's impossible, so φ can't be zero.

So, sinhφ can't be zero, meaning that BD² can't be as low as 80. So, the minimal BD² is higher than 80.

But how do we find the minimal value?

Wait, perhaps we can express sinh²φ in terms of θ.

From earlier, we have tanhφ= -5/(6 tanhθ).

Let me express sinh²φ in terms of tanhφ.

We know that sinh²φ = (tanhφ)^2 / (1 - tanh²φ).

So,

sinh²φ= [ (25)/(36 tanh²θ) ] / [1 - (25)/(36 tanh²θ) ]

= [25/(36 t²)] / [1 -25/(36 t²)], where t=tanhθ.

So,

sinh²φ= [25/(36 t²)] / [ (36 t² -25)/(36 t²) ) ] =25/(36 t² -25).

Thus,

BD²=80 +176*(25)/(36 t² -25).

=80 + (176*25)/(36 t² -25).

=80 + 4400/(36 t² -25).

So, BD²=80 +4400/(36 t² -25).

Now, we can consider t², which is tanh²θ, which ranges between 0 and1.

But from earlier, when we had y²>600/11≈54.545, which comes from the condition that the denominator must be positive, so 36 t² -25 must be positive, because tanhθ is real and finite, so t² <1.

Wait, wait, 36 t² -25>0 → t²>25/36 → |t|>5/6.

So, tanhθ must satisfy |t|>5/6.

So, t can be in (-1, -5/6) ∪ (5/6,1).

So, t²>25/36.

So, the denominator 36 t² -25 is positive, and the expression 4400/(36 t² -25) is positive.

So, BD² is 80 plus a positive term, so BD² is greater than 80.

Now, to find the minimal BD², we need to minimize 4400/(36 t² -25) as t² approaches 25/36 from above.

So, as t² approaches 25/36+, 36t²-25 approaches 0+, so 4400/(36t²-25) approaches infinity, making BD² approach infinity.

But wait, that's the opposite of what we want. Wait, wait, no, if t² approaches 25/36 from above, 36t²-25 approaches 0 from positive side, so 4400/(36t²-25) approaches infinity, making BD² approach infinity. So, BD² can be made as large as we want, but we are looking for the minimal BD².

Wait, so perhaps the minimal BD² occurs when t² is as large as possible, i.e., t approaches 1, so tanhθ approaches 1.

So, when t approaches 1, t² approaches1, so 36t²-25 approaches 36-25=11, so 4400/(36t²-25) approaches 4400/11=400.

So, BD² approaches 80 +400=480.

So, the minimal BD² is 480 when t²=1, but as t approaches 1, tanhθ approaches1, which implies θ approaches infinity.

Wait, but wait, if t approaches1, then θ approaches infinity, so coshθ and sinhθ approach infinity.

So, point A would be at (sqrt20 coshθ, sqrt24 sinhθ), which as θ approaches infinity, x and y approach infinity.

Similarly, point B would be determined by φ such that tanhθ tanhφ= -5/6.

If tanhθ approaches1, then tanhφ approaches -5/6, since tanhθ * tanhφ= -5/6.

So, tanhφ= -5/(6 tanhθ) → as tanhθ approaches1, tanhφ approaches -5/6.

So, φ approaches arctanh(-5/6), which is a finite value.

So, as θ approaches infinity, point A goes to infinity, and point B approaches a finite point.

Wait, but in this case, BD² approaches 480.

So, perhaps 480 is the minimal BD².

Wait, but let me check when tanhθ approaches 5/6 from above.

Wait, earlier, we saw that t=tanhθ must be greater than5/6 in absolute value, so t²>25/36.

So, when t approaches5/6 from above, t² approaches25/36, so 36t²-25 approaches 0, and 4400/(36t²-25) approaches infinity, so BD² approaches infinity.

So, the minimal BD² occurs when t is as large as possible, which is t approaching1, giving BD² approaching 480.

So, the minimal BD² is 480.

Wait, but earlier, when I tried putting point B at (2√5, 0), I found that point A would have x=0, which is impossible. So, perhaps BD² can't be 80, but can approach 80, but in reality, the minimal BD² is 480.

Wait, no, that can't be, because when t approaches1, BD² approaches480, but when t approaches5/6 from above, BD² approaches infinity. So, the minimal BD² is480.

Wait, but earlier when I tried substituting t=5/6, I saw that it's the minimal t² where the denominator is zero, but that's where the expression becomes undefined. So, the minimal BD² is achieved when t approaches1, giving BD²=480.

So, that would mean that BD² can be as small as480, but no smaller. So, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombuses would be480.

But wait, let me verify this.

If BD² can be as small as480, then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombuses would be480, because for any rhombus, BD² is at least480, so 480 is less than or equal to BD² for all rhombuses.

Wait, but earlier when I thought the minimal BD² was480, and if that's indeed the case, then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombuses is480.

Wait, but wait, is480 the minimal BD²? Because when θ approaches infinity, point A goes to infinity, and point B approaches a finite point.

Wait, perhaps I should compute BD² when θ is such that t=tanhθ= sqrt(25/36 + something).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the parametrization.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute BD² in terms of t, and find its minimal value.

From earlier, BD²=80 +4400/(36 t² -25).

We can consider this as a function f(t²)=80 +4400/(36 t² -25), where t²>25/36.

We can find the minimum of f(t²) by taking derivative and setting it to zero.

But since t²>25/36, let's set u=36 t² -25, then u>0.

Then, BD²=80 +4400/u.

To minimize BD², we need to maximize u.

But u can be made arbitrarily large as t² approaches infinity, which would make BD² approach80.

Wait, but earlier conclusion was different. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, no, because when t² approaches infinity, u=36t²-25 approaches infinity, so 4400/u approaches zero, and BD² approaches80.

Wait, that's conflicting with earlier conclusions.

Wait, so perhaps as t approaches infinity, BD² approaches80.

But earlier, when I parametrized points A and B, I thought that when t approaches1, BD² approaches480, but perhaps that was a miscalculation.

Wait, let me re-examine.

Wait, in the parametrization using θ and φ, I expressed BD²=80 +4400/(36 t² -25), where t=tanhθ.

If t approaches infinity, that's not possible, because tanhθ approaches1 as θ approaches infinity.

Wait, no, tanhθ approaches1 as θ approaches infinity, so t approaches1, not infinity.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in substituting t=tanhθ, so t is actually between -1 and1.

So, t is bounded, so t cannot approach infinity. So, when t approaches1, u=36t²-25 approaches36(1)-25=11.

So, 4400/u approaches4400/11=400, so BD² approaches80+400=480.

When t approaches5/6 from above, u approaches0, so BD² approaches infinity.

When t approaches1, BD² approaches480.

When t approaches just above5/6, BD² approaches infinity.

So, the minimal value of BD² is480, achieved when t approaches1.

Wait, but then why did I think earlier that as t approaches1, u approaches11, giving BD²=480.

But when θ approaches infinity, t approaches1, and point A goes to infinity, but BD² approaches480.

So, that suggests that the minimal BD² is480.

Thus, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombuses is480.

Wait, but earlier when I tried to minimize u² +v², I found that the minimal value is when u² +v² is minimal, but that required y²>600/11, leading to BD²>80, but perhaps that approach was wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct minimal BD² is480.

So, the answer is480.

But let me confirm.

Wait, let me compute BD² when θ approaches a value where t=5/6.

Wait, t=5/6, which is tanhθ=5/6.

Then, t²=25/36, so 36t²-25=0, which makes BD² approach infinity.

So, the minimal BD² occurs when t approaches1, giving BD²=480.

So, the minimal BD² is480.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombuses is480.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought that as t approaches1, BD² approaches480, but when I considered t approaching infinity, which is not possible, I thought it approaches80. But since t is bounded between -1 and1, the minimal BD² is480.

Thus, the answer is480.


To solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus ABCD on the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals are perpendicular, and their lengths are determined by the points on the hyperbola.

1. **Hyperbola Parametrization**: Points on the hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions as \(A = (\sqrt{20} \cosh\theta, \sqrt{24} \sinh\theta)\) and \(B = (\sqrt{20} \cosh\phi, \sqrt{24} \sinh\phi)\).

2. **Perpendicular Diagonals Condition**: The condition for the diagonals AC and BD to be perpendicular leads to \(\tanh\theta \tanh\phi = -\frac{5}{6}\).

3. **Expression for BD²**: The length of diagonal BD is expressed as:
   \[
   BD^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2)
   \]
   where \(u = \sqrt{20} \cosh\phi\) and \(v = \sqrt{24} \sinh\phi\). Using hyperbolic identities, this simplifies to:
   \[
   BD^2 = 80 + \frac{4400}{36 \tanh^2\theta - 25}
   \]

4. **Minimizing BD²**: To find the minimum value of \(BD^2\), we analyze the behavior of the function as \(\tanh\theta\) approaches its bounds. The minimal value occurs when \(\tanh\theta\) approaches 1, leading to:
   \[
   BD^2 \to 80 + 400 = 480
   \]

Thus, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombuses is \(\boxed{480}\).
