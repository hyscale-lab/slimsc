Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. The torus is made by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. Then, when this torus is placed inside a larger sphere of radius 11, it's tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it's placed outside, it's tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I should probably visualize the torus. It's like a donut shape, right? The circle being revolved has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of that circle to the axis of revolution is 6. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) is 6, and the minor radius (radius of the generating circle) is 3.

Now, the sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent, and when it's outside, they're also tangent. I need to find the radii of these tangent circles for both internal and external tangency.

I remember that for two surfaces to be tangent along a circle, the distance between their centers must equal the sum or difference of their radii, depending on whether they're externally or internally tangent. Wait, but in this case, it's not just spheres; it's a sphere and a torus. So, maybe it's a bit more complicated.

Wait, no, actually, when a torus is tangent to a sphere, the point of tangency is a circle. So, perhaps for the internal tangency, the sphere and torus touch along a circle, and similarly for external.

But how do I find the radii r_i and r_o of these circles?

I think I need to consider the geometry of the torus and the sphere. Let me recall the equation of a torus. The standard equation for a torus centered at the origin with major radius R and minor radius r is:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r²

In this case, R is 6 and r is 3. So the equation becomes:

(√(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 9

And the sphere has the equation:

x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the distance from the origin to the center of the torus must be such that the sphere and torus touch at a single circle. Similarly for external.

Wait, but the torus is already centered at the origin, isn't it? Because when you revolve a circle around an axis in its plane, the center of the torus is on that axis. So if the torus is centered at
