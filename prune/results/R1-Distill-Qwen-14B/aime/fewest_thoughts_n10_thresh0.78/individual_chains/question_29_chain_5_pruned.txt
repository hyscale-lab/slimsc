Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, and F are collinear. Also, all points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let me visualize this. Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, all their angles are right angles. Let me try drawing a rough sketch in my mind. Let's consider rectangle ABCD with AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, AB is the length, and BC is the width. Then, rectangle EFGH has sides FG = 17 and EF = 184. So, EF is the length, and FG is the width.

Points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they lie on a straight line. So, if I imagine the line passing through D, E, C, F, the order of these points is important. Let me think about the positions of the rectangles.

Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, their sides are at right angles. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle, which means these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. That's an important clue because it tells me that the quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

Let me try to note down the positions of the points.

Let me denote the coordinates of the points to make it easier. Maybe assigning coordinates can help me figure out the distances.

Let's assume point D is at the origin (0, 0) to simplify things. Since ABCD is a rectangle, with AB = 107 and BC = 16, then:

- Point A would be at (0, 107) because AB is vertical.
- Point B would be at (16, 107) because BC is horizontal.
- Point C would be at (16, 0) because CD is vertical.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. If ABCD is a rectangle, the order of the points matters. Let me clarify the order of the rectangle. Typically, rectangles are labeled in order, so ABCD would mean AB is adjacent to BC, which is adjacent to CD, which is adjacent to DA.

So, if AB = 107 and BC = 16, then AB is the length, and BC is the width. So, point A is connected to B, then to C, then to D, then back to A.

Assuming point D is at (0, 0), then:

- Point C would be at (0, 16) because CD is vertical and BC is 16? Wait, no, BC is 16. So if BC is 16, then point B is at (16, something), and point C is at (16, something else).

Wait, maybe I should assign coordinates more systematically.

Let me define the coordinate system such that point D is at (0, 0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, if we move from D to C, that's one side, and from D to A is the other side.

If I take DC as the horizontal side, then point C would be at (x, 0). Point D is at (0, 0), so DC = x. Then, DA is vertical, so point A would be at (0, y). Then, point B would be at (x, y).

Given that BC = 16 and AB = 107.

Wait, BC is the side from B to C, which would be a vertical side because in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So if BC = 16
