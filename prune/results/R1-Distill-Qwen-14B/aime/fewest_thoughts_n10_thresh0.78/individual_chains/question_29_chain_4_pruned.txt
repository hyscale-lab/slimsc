Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the details.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on the same straight line. Additionally, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

First, let me try to visualize the problem. I imagine two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, placed in such a way that their sides are aligned along a straight line that includes points D, E, C, and F. So, the line passes through D, then E, then C, then F. Since both are rectangles, their sides are all at right angles.

Given that ABCD is a rectangle, AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, AB is one side, and BC is the adjacent side. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle with FG = 17 and EF = 184. So, EF is one side, FG is the adjacent side.

Since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, that means these four points are concyclic or lie on the circumference of the same circle. I remember that if four points lie on a circle, then the quadrilateral formed by them is cyclic, and certain properties apply, like the opposite angles summing to 180 degrees. But I'm not sure how that helps here yet.

Let me try sketching this in my mind. Let's assume rectangle ABCD is placed such that side BC is vertical, and AB is horizontal. So, point A is at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. Rectangle EFGH is another rectangle; I need to figure out its orientation. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, and E and F are points on EFGH, perhaps EFGH is placed such that its sides are also aligned with the same line DC-EF.

Wait, maybe it's better to assign coordinates to these points to make the problem more concrete. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since ABCD is a rectangle, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (x, y), but I need to figure out the coordinates based on the given lengths.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to assign coordinates more strategically. Let me think. Let's place point D at (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC is 16, which is the vertical side, then AB is 107, the horizontal side. So, if D is at (0,0), then point C would be at (AB, BC) = (107,16). But wait, no, that depends on how we orient the rectangle.

Wait, maybe I should define the coordinates more carefully. Let me consider ABCD with points labeled in order. So, rectangle ABCD has points A, B, C, D. So, let me assign coordinates such that point A is at (0,0). Then, since AB = 107, point B would be at (107, 0). BC is 16, so since ABCD is a rectangle, BC would be vertical. So, point C would be at (107,16), and point D would be at (0,16). Wait, that makes sense because AD would then be 16 units as well, which is consistent with it being a rectangle.

Wait, but if D is at (0,16), then EFGH has points E, F, G, H. The problem states that D, E, C, F are
