Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on complex numbers, but I think I can figure this out.

First, I remember that any complex number \( z \) can be written in polar form, especially since we know its magnitude. Since \( |z| = 4 \), we can express \( z \) as \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That should make things easier because dealing with exponentials might simplify the expression.

So, let me substitute \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the given expression. The first term becomes \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \). The second term is \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} \). Let me compute each part separately.

Starting with the first term: \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \). I can factor out the 4, so it becomes \( 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \). Similarly, the second term simplifies to \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4} \times e^{-i\theta} \) because \( 1/z = e^{-i\theta} \) when \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). Simplifying the constants, the second term becomes \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

So now the entire expression is \( 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \). Let me compute each of these terms.

First, let's compute \( 4(75 + 117i) \). That would be \( 300 + 468i \). So the first term is \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \). The second term is \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

Now, I can write these exponentials in terms of cosine and sine. Remember that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So, expanding the first term:
\( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
= \( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta \)
Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this becomes:
= \( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)
Now, group the real and imaginary parts:
Real part: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)
Imaginary part: \( (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i \)

Similarly, expanding the second term:
\( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)
= \( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta \)
Again, \( i^2 = -1 \), so:
= \( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)
Grouping real and imaginary parts:
Real part: \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)
Imaginary part: \( (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)i \)

Now, adding both terms together, the total expression is the sum of the real parts and the sum of the imaginary parts.

Adding the real parts:
\( (300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) \)
= \( (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta \)
= \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

Adding the imaginary parts:
\( (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i + (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)i \)
= \( (300\sin\theta -24\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta + 36\cos\theta)i \)
= \( (276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta)i \)

But since we're only interested in the real part of the entire expression, we can ignore the imaginary parts. So, the real part is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, for the first term's real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ. Second term's real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ. Adding them: 300 +24 = 324, cosθ, and -468 +36 = -432, sinθ. So that's correct.

So, the real part is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression as θ varies.

This looks like a linear combination of sine and cosine, which can be expressed as a single sinusoidal function. The maximum value of \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) is \( \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \). So, maybe I can apply that here.

Wait, but in our case, it's \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). So, the coefficients are A=324, B=-432.

So, the maximum value would be \( \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \). Let me compute that.

First, calculate 324 squared:

324 * 324. Let's compute this step by step.

324 * 300 = 97,200

324 * 24 = 7,776

So, 97,200 + 7,776 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared:

432 * 400 = 172,800

432 * 32 = 13,824

Adding them: 172,800 + 13,824 = 186,624.

So, the squares are 104,976 and 186,624. Adding them together: 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

Then, the square root of 291,600. Hmm, 540 squared is 291,600 because 500^2 = 250,000, 540^2 = (500 + 40)^2 = 250,000 + 2*500*40 + 40^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So, sqrt(291600)=540.

So, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me confirm that. Because in our case, the expression is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \), which can be written as \( R \cos(\theta + \phi) \), where R is sqrt(3
