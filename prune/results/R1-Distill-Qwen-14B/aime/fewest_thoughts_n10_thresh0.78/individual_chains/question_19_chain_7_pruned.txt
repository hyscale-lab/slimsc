Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says:

Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, circumradius 13, and inradius 6. We need to find AB · AC.

Hmm, okay. So, triangle ABC has its circumcenter O and incenter I. IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, which is the radius of the circumscribed circle around ABC. The inradius is 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle.

I remember that the circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle by the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where a, b, c are the sides and Δ is the area. The inradius r is given by r = Δ/s, where s is the semi-perimeter.

But wait, in this problem, we have some specific conditions: IA ⊥ OI. That seems important. I also know that in a triangle, the incenter is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors.

I think it might help to draw a diagram. Let me visualize triangle ABC with O as the circumcenter and I as the incenter. IA is one of the angle bisectors, and OI is the line connecting the incenter to the circumcenter. These two lines are perpendicular.

Hmm, perhaps I can use some properties of triangle centers here. I recall that in some cases, the Euler line connects several centers, but in this case, maybe the incenter and circumcenter aren't on the Euler line? Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should recall the formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. I think the distance OI can be found using the formula OI² = R(R - 2r). Is that right? Let me check: yes, I think that formula is correct. So, OI² = R² - 2Rr.

Given that R = 13 and r = 6, that would make OI² = 13² - 2*13*6. Let me compute that: 169 - 156 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, but in the problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle
