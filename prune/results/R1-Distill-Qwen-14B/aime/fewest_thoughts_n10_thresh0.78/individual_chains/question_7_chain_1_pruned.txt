Okay, so I've got this probability problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal chance. The question is asking for the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation that turns all blue vertices into positions where there were originally red vertices. The answer needs to be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the octagon is regular, so it's symmetric. Each vertex is equally likely to be red or blue, right? So each color has a 50% chance, independent of others.

The problem is about rotations. So, if you rotate the octagon, maybe the blue vertices can align with previously red ones. So, the probability we're looking for is the chance that such a rotation exists.

Wait, so I need to count the number of colorings where there's at least one rotation (other than the identity rotation) such that when you apply that rotation, all blue vertices move to positions that were red before the rotation. Hmm, but wait, no. Actually, it's the probability that there exists a rotation such that when you rotate the octagon by that rotation, all the blue vertices end up where red vertices were before the rotation.

Wait, let me think again. So, for a given coloring, we can rotate the octagon and check if the set of blue vertices after rotation is a subset of the red vertices in the original coloring. Or is it that after rotation, all blue vertices are now where red ones were? Wait, the problem says: the octagon can be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices.

So, more precisely, for a given coloring, is there a rotation such that every blue vertex in the original coloring, when rotated, moves to a position that was originally red.

Wait, but the original red positions are fixed. So, if we have a coloring, then we can rotate the octagon, and see if the image of each blue vertex under the rotation is a red vertex in the original coloring.

Alternatively, perhaps it's equivalent to saying that the set of blue vertices is a subset of the image of the red vertices under some rotation.

Wait, maybe another approach: the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because when you rotate, the positions of the blue vertices move to where the red ones were.

So, if B is the set of blue vertices, R is the set of red vertices. Then, the condition is that B is a rotation of R. Because if B is a rotation of R, then there's a rotation that maps R to B, which would mean that when you rotate the octagon, the blue vertices (B) are moved to the positions that were originally red (R).

But wait, actually, R and B are complementary sets, since each vertex is either red or blue. So, R is the complement of B. So, if B is a rotation of R, then R is a rotation of B as well.

Wait, but if B is a rotation of R, which is the complement of B, then B is a rotation of its own complement. So, that would mean that the set B is a rotationally symmetric set in a way that it's equal to a rotation of its complement.

Hmm, but how many such colorings are there?

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as the number of colorings where the set of blue vertices is a union of orbits under the action of rotation by some divisor of 8. Because, for the set B to be a rotation of R, which is the complement, the set B must itself be a rotationally symmetric set.

Wait, but the octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8, so the possible rotations are multiples of 45 degrees. The divisors of 8 are 1,2,4,8. So, the possible rotational symmetries that map the octagon onto itself are rotations by 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, 315°, and 360° (which is the same as 0°).

But perhaps the key is that the set B must be fixed under some rotation. So, the set B is a union of orbits under rotation by some angle. So, for each divisor d of 8, the rotation by 360/d degrees would partition the octagon's vertices into d orbits, each of size 8/d.

So, the possible orbit sizes are 1, 2, 4, 8.

Wait, so if the set B is a union of entire orbits under some rotation, then B would be fixed by that rotation. So, the condition that B is a rotation of R would imply that B is a union of entire orbits under some rotation.

Because if B is a rotation of R, then since R is the complement of B, that would imply that B is the image of R under some rotation. But since R is the complement, that would mean that B is a rotated version of its own complement.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider that the set B must be a union of cycles under some rotation.

Alternatively, let me think in terms of group theory. The rotation group of the octagon is cyclic of order 8, so it's isomorphic to Z8. So, each element of the group is a rotation by k*45 degrees, for k = 0,1,...,7.

The group action is on the set of vertices, so the orbits under the group action are the cycles of vertices that can be rotated into each other.

Wait, but each orbit is a single vertex if the rotation is by 45 degrees, but that's not correct because each rotation cycles multiple vertices.

Wait, perhaps I got that wrong. The orbits under the group action would actually be the entire set of vertices if considering the entire group, but if we fix a subgroup generated by a rotation of order d, then the orbits under that subgroup would be of size d.

Wait, no. Let's think of it as each rotation by 360/d degrees for d dividing 8. So, for each d, the rotation by 360/d degrees partitions the octagon into d cycles, each of length 8/d.

So, for d=1, there's only one cycle of length 8.

For d=2, there are two cycles of length 4 each.

For d=4, there are four cycles of length 2 each.

For d=8, there are eight cycles of length 1 each.

So, when the set B is a union of entire cycles under some rotation of order d, then B is fixed by that rotation.

Wait, but in our problem, B is being rotated to R, which is the complement of B. So, if B is a union of entire cycles under a rotation by 360/d degrees, then the complement of B (which is R) must also be a union of entire cycles under that rotation. Since each cycle is either entirely in B or entirely in R.

So, in this case, the condition is that B is a union of entire cycles under some rotation, which would imply that R is also a union of entire cycles under that same rotation. Which makes sense, because if B is a rotation of R, then R must be a union of cycles as well.

So, the number of colorings where B is a union of entire cycles under some rotation is equal to the number of such colorings where B is a union of entire orbits under the rotation by k*45 degrees, for some k.

So, to compute the total number of such colorings, we can consider all possible d (divisors of 8) and count the number of colorings where B is a union of entire cycles of length 8/d, for each d. But we have to be careful not to double-count colorings that are unions of cycles under multiple rotations.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion is needed here. Because a coloring that is a union of cycles under multiple rotations would be counted multiple times.

Alternatively, maybe Burnside's lemma can be applied here. Burnside's lemma relates the number of orbits to the average number of fixed points. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Wait, let's think differently. The problem is to count the number of colorings where the set B is fixed by some non-identity rotation. Because if B is fixed by a rotation, then rotating the octagon by that rotation would leave B unchanged, which would imply that B is equal to the image of R under that rotation, since R is the complement of B.

Wait, no. If a rotation fixes B, then R (the complement of B) is also fixed by that rotation. So, if B is fixed by a rotation, then R is fixed as well. So, for such colorings, B is a union of cycles under that rotation, and R is also a union of cycles under that rotation.

Wait, but in our problem, the condition is that there's a rotation that maps B to R. So, perhaps B is a rotation of R, which would mean that B is the image of R under some rotation. So, if B is a rotation of R, then R must also be a rotation of B, because applying the inverse rotation would take R to B. So, that implies that the set B is a rotation of its own complement.

Hmm, but how does that help me count the number of such colorings?

Alternatively, perhaps the number of such colorings is equal to the number of colorings where B is a union of cycles under some non-identity rotation. So, for each divisor d of 8, we can count the number of colorings where B is a union of cycles of length 8/d under a rotation of order d.

But we have to consider all possible d and sum these counts, but then subtract overlaps where colorings are fixed under multiple rotations.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this using Möbius inversion. But I'm not too familiar with that.

Wait, maybe it's easier to model each possible rotation and count the number of colorings fixed under that rotation, then use inclusion-exclusion to account for overlaps.

Wait, another approach: the total number of colorings is 2
