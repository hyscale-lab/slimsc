Okay, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance is supposed to be in the form m√n / p, and then I need to find m + n + p. 

First, I should probably visualize the tetrahedron. It's given that opposite edges are equal: AB = CD = √41, AC = BD = √80, and BC = AD = √89. That symmetry might be useful. It suggests that the tetrahedron is "isohedral" or something like that, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's a kind of symmetric tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. I remember that in such cases, the tetrahedron might be able to be inscribed in a sphere or something. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

The key thing is that there's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that its distance to each face is equal. That point is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is called the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

In a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius is similar to that in a triangle. For a triangle, the inradius r = A / s, where A is the area and s is the semi-perimeter. For a tetrahedron, the formula is r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces). Wait, let me check that. I think the formula for the inradius is r = 3V / (sum of the areas of the four faces). So, I need to find the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S.

But to find V, I might need the edge lengths. Hmm, but do I have enough information? Well, the edges are given in a symmetric way. Maybe I can compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant, which is a formula that gives the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths.

The formula for the Cayley-Menger determinant is:

Volume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   AB² AC² AD² |
| 1  AB²  0   BC² BD² |
| 1  AC² BC²  0   CD² |
| 1  AD² BD² CD²  0  |

But wait, I think the matrix is 5x5. Let me recall the exact structure. The Cayley-Menger matrix for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD is a 5x5 matrix where the first row and column are [0,1,1,1,1], and the diagonal is 0, and the other entries are the squares of the edge lengths.

Wait, maybe it's better to write it down step by step.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for points A, B, C, D is:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   AB² AC² AD² |
| 1  AB²  0   BC² BD² |
| 1  AC² BC²  0   CD² |
| 1  AD² BD² CD²  0  |

So, the determinant is 288 * V². Therefore, Volume V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ). I need to compute this determinant.

Given that AB = CD = √41, so AB² = CD² = 41.

AC = BD = √80, so AC² = BD² = 80.

BC = AD = √89, so BC² = AD² = 89.

Let me write down the CM matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41
