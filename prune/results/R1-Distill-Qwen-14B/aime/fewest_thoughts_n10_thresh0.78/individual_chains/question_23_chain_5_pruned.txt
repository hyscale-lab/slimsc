Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi ABCD. The rhombus is on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. Hmm, interesting.

First, I should recall that a rhombus has all sides equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Oh wait, no, actually, I think they are. Because a rhombus is a type of parallelogram where all sides are equal, and in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Yeah, that's right. So, in this case, the diagonals intersect at the origin, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

Given that ABCD is a rhombus, and all four points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. The hyperbola is centered at the origin, so that makes sense.

So, the diagonals intersect at the origin. Let me denote the points as A, B, C, D. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So, if one diagonal is BD, the other is AC. They intersect at the origin.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points are symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if point A is (x,y), then point C will be (-x,-y). Similarly, point B will be (p,q), and point D will be (-p,-q).

So, all four points are A(x,y), B(p,q), C(-x,-y), D(-p,-q).

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C, which equals the distance from C to D, which equals the distance from D to A.

But maybe there's a better way to approach this.
