Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out step by step.

First, let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, right? But maybe that's not too important for this problem. What matters is that it has 12 vertices, each equally spaced around a circle.

Now, the problem is about forming rectangles. Rectangles have opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. In the context of a dodecagon, the sides of the rectangle could be sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, I guess the key is to figure out how to select four vertices of the dodecagon such that they form a rectangle, meaning the sides are appropriately aligned.

Wait, but how do rectangles form in a regular polygon? In a regular polygon with even sides, like a square or a hexagon, it's easier to see rectangles because they can be aligned with the axes. But a dodecagon has 12 sides, which is divisible by 4, so maybe similar logic applies here.

I remember that in a regular polygon, the number of rectangles can be determined by considering pairs of parallel sides or diagonals. So, for a rectangle, I need two pairs of parallel lines. In a dodecagon, each side is separated by a central angle of 30 degrees (since 360/12 = 30). So, the sides or diagonals can be thought of as vectors from the center, each at multiples of 30 degrees.

To form a rectangle, we need two pairs of opposite sides. Each pair should be parallel, meaning they have the same central angle. So, let me think about how to count these pairs.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of selecting two pairs of points that are symmetric about the center. Because in a regular polygon, a rectangle must be such that its opposite sides are not only parallel but also symmetric about the center of the polygon.

So, perhaps the way to count rectangles is to consider all possible pairs of diameters (lines passing through the center) and then see how they can form rectangles.

Wait, another thought: in a regular polygon with an even number of sides, the number of rectangles is equal to the number of ways to choose two pairs of parallel sides. For a regular n-gon where n is divisible by 4, the number of rectangles is (n/4 choose 2) multiplied by something? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the number of rectangles can be found by considering all possible pairs of opposite sides and counting how they can form rectangles. But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me try to approach this more systematically.
