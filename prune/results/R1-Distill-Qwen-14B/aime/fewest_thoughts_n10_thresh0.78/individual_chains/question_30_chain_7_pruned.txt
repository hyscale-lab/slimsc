Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but let's break it down step by step.

First off, ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. That's good to know because it tells me about the properties of ω, like all the powers of ω from ω^0 up to ω^12 are distinct and cover all the roots of the equation x^13 - 1 = 0.

The expression I need to compute is the product of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) for k from 0 to 12. Wait, when k=0, ω^0 is 1, so let's compute that term first. Plugging k=0 into the expression gives 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the first term is 1. That simplifies things a bit because multiplying by 1 doesn't change the product.

So the product simplifies to 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Now, my task is to compute this product for k=1 to 12.

Let me write the general term as (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Hmm, maybe I can factor this or find a pattern. Let's see: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} can be rearranged or factored.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out a common term or rewrite it as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me think. If I treat ω^k as a variable, say x, then the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. That's a quadratic in x: x^2 - 2x + 2.

Wait, so each term is x^2 - 2x + 2 where x = ω^k. So the product is the product over k=1 to 12 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) with x being each of the primitive 13th roots of unity. But wait, when k ranges from 1 to 12, ω^k are all the primitive
