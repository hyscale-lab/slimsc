Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF. It says all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, which is interesting. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. An equilateral hexagon means all sides are equal, right? But it's not necessarily regular since the angles can vary. But the key here is that opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC to EF, and CD to FA. That must mean the hexagon has some symmetry or structure that allows for these parallel sides.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, if I extend these sides, they meet to form a triangle. Let me denote the triangle as PQR, where P is the intersection of AB and CD, Q is the intersection of CD and EF, and R is the intersection of EF and AB. The sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. But I don't know which side corresponds to which length yet.

Wait, maybe I should consider similar triangles. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, the triangle formed by extending the sides must be similar to a smaller triangle inside the hexagon. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, another thought: in a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the extensions of the sides form a larger triangle, and the hexagon is sort of "inscribed" within this triangle. So, perhaps each side of the hexagon is part of a line that's parallel to the sides of this larger triangle.

Hmm, maybe I should use coordinate geometry to model this. Let me set up a coordinate system where the triangle PQR is my reference. Let me assume triangle PQR has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. Let me assign coordinates to P, Q, R such that calculations will be easier.

Wait, maybe using barycentric coordinates or something else. Alternatively, I could use vectors or affine transformations. But maybe it's simpler to use similar triangles.

Since each pair of opposite sides is parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as a centrally symmetric hexagon? Wait, no, not necessarily, because it's equilateral but not necessarily regular. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to a beehive or a regular hexagon, but in this case, sides are equilateral but angles can vary. But with opposite sides parallel, it might have some properties similar to a regular hexagon.

Let me think about the triangle formed by the extensions. Since the sides of the triangle are 200, 240, and 300, perhaps I can use the area ratio. Maybe the hexagon's side relates to the triangle's sides proportionally.

Wait, another approach: the hexagon can be divided into smaller congruent parts, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, each side of the hexagon could be a portion of the triangle's sides, with the same proportion.

Wait, maybe using the concept of similar triangles. If AB, CD, and EF are extended to form the triangle, then the triangle is similar to some inner triangles within the hexagon. But I'm not entirely certain how.

Wait, perhaps the hexagon can be considered as a truncated version of the triangle. If I cut off three smaller triangles from the corners of triangle PQR, each of which is similar to PQR, then the remaining figure would be the hexagon.

Yes, that makes sense. So, each of the three sides of the triangle is divided into two parts: one part is the side of the hexagon, and the other is the side of the small triangle that was cut off.

Since all sides of the hexagon are equal, let's call each side length 's'. Then, each side of the triangle PQR is equal to s plus the corresponding side of the small triangle.

But wait, the triangle PQR has sides of 200, 240, and 300. So, each
