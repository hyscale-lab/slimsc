Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q and R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. Finally, I have to find Q + R.

Hmm, okay. So N is a four-digit number. Let's denote it as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. Since it's a four-digit number, A can't be zero. Also, N is the greatest such number with this particular property. So among all four-digit numbers with this property, N is the largest.

The key property here is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, no matter which digit I choose (A, B, C, D), replacing it with 1 gives a number divisible by 7.

My goal is to find N, then compute Q = N / 1000 (the thousands digit, essentially) and R = N mod 1000 (the last three digits), then add them together.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to find the largest four-digit number N such that changing any single digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.

So, to approach this, I can think that for each digit position, replacing it with 1 gives a number divisible by 7. So, the original number N must satisfy certain conditions related to modular arithmetic with 7.

Let me think about each digit position:

1. Changing the thousands digit (A) to 1: The new number is 1BCD. So, 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. Changing the hundreds digit (B) to 1: The new number is A1CD. So, A1CD ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. Changing the tens digit (C) to 1: The new number is AB1D. So, AB1D ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. Changing the units digit (D) to 1: The new number is ABC1. So, ABC1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, all four modified numbers must be divisible by 7. Let's express each of these in terms of N.

But first, let's note that N is ABCD, which is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

When we change A to 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

Similarly, changing B to 1: 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.

Changing C to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D.

Changing D to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 = N - D + 1.

Each of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, let's write down these conditions:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. N - D + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Wait, but N is equal to 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, the fourth condition is N - D + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7. So, N ≡ D - 1 mod 7.

Hmm, interesting. Let me note down these four conditions.

Let me compute each condition modulo 7.

First, let's compute each modified number modulo 7.

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Compute 1000 mod 7: 1000 / 7 is 142*7=994, 1000 - 994 = 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

100 ≡ 2 mod 7 (since 100/7=14*7=98, so 100-98=2).

10 ≡ 3 mod 7.

So, 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, condition 1: 6 + 2B + 3C + D
