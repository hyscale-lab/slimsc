Okay, so I've got this problem here about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths have to be of length 16, which makes sense because moving from the lower left to the upper right on an 8x8 grid would require 8 right and 8 up moves, totaling 16 steps. So, the grid is like a chessboard, right? 8 rows and 8 columns.

The key part of the problem is that the paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay. I remember that in grid path problems, each path can be represented as a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves. So, for example, a path might start with R, R, U, U, and so on, until it reaches the end.

Now, when do paths change direction? Well, each time the direction changes, it's when the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right. So, if a path goes R, R, U, U, R, R, U, U, that's a lot of changes. Let me count: R to U is one change, U to R is another, R to U is another. That's three changes. Wait, but the problem says exactly four changes. Hmm.

Wait, actually, the number of direction changes is related to how the path alternates between horizontal and vertical moves. Each change is a switch from one direction to the other. So, for example, if a path is R, R, U, U, R, R, U, U, that's three changes: R to U, U to R, R to U. But that path has three runs or segments of moves. Wait, no, waitâ€”each time the direction changes, a new segment starts. So, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the direction switches minus one? Or is it equal to the number of runs minus one?

Wait, let's think. If you have a path that's just all R's followed by all U's, that's one direction change. So, if you have two runs: R's and then U's, that's one change. Similarly, if you have three runs, like R, U, R, that's two changes. So, number of direction changes is equal to the number of runs minus one. Or wait, no, because each run is a consecutive sequence of the same direction. So, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs.

Wait, no. Let's see. For example, a path that starts with R, then changes to U, then back to R: that's two direction changes. But the number of runs is three. So, indeed, direction changes = runs - 1. So, if we have exactly four direction changes, that means the path has five runs.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner with exactly five runs. Each run is a consecutive sequence of R's or U's. Also, since the grid is 8x8, the total number of R's is 8, and the total number of U's is 8.

So
