Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walk. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks s + 2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Hmm. So, the problem is about figuring out how long her walk takes when she walks at a different speed, specifically s + 1/2 km/h. They give us information about two different speeds and the time each takes, including the coffee shop time. We need to find the time when her speed is s + 1/2.

Let me break it down.

First, Aya walks 9 kilometers. So the distance is constant: 9 km. The time she takes depends on her walking speed, but each time, she also spends t minutes in the coffee shop. So the total time given includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time.

So, when her speed is s km/h, the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes. Similarly, when her speed is s + 2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which again includes t minutes.

Wait, so the difference in total time is because she's walking faster, which makes sense. But since the coffee shop time (t) is included both times, we can probably set up equations to eliminate t and solve for s and maybe t.

Let me think about how to model this.

The time taken for the walk without the coffee shop would be distance divided by speed. So, for the first scenario, walking at s km/h, the walking time is 9 / s hours. Similarly, when walking at s + 2 km/h, the walking time is 9 / (s + 2) hours.

But the total time given includes the coffee shop time, which is t minutes. So I need to adjust for that.

Wait, but the times are given in hours and minutes. Hmm, perhaps I should convert everything into hours or everything into minutes to avoid confusion.

Let me convert all times into hours because the speeds are in km/h.

First scenario: total time is 4 hours. But 4 hours includes t minutes. So the walking time is 4 hours minus t minutes converted into hours. Similarly, the second scenario: total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Again, the walking time is 2 hours 24 minutes minus t minutes, converted into hours.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to write equations in terms of t in hours. Wait, but t is given in minutes in the problem, but when we work with the equations, maybe it's better to convert t into hours.

Wait, perhaps I can set up two equations based on the two scenarios.

Let me define:

Let t be the coffee shop time in hours. Because when we calculate time, it's in hours, since speed is km/h.

Wait, the problem says t minutes. So I have to convert t minutes into hours. So t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, for the first scenario:

Total time is 4 hours, which is equal to walking time plus coffee time.

Walking time is 9 / s hours.

So, 9 / s + t / 60 = 4.

Similarly, for the second scenario:

Total time is 2 hours 24 minutes. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So total time is 2.4 hours.

Walking time is 9 / (s
