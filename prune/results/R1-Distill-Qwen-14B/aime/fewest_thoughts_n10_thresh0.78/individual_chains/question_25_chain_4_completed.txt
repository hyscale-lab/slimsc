Okay, I'm going to try to solve this problem. It's about sets and their intersections, so I think I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me start by understanding the problem.

So, there are 900 residents in Aimeville. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. Additionally, some residents own other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, or garden spades. The numbers are:

- Diamond ring owners: 195
- Golf clubs owners: 367
- Garden spade owners: 562

Wait, but wait, each of the 900 residents also owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that means the candy hearts are like a common item everyone has. So, all four items are things that residents can own, but candy hearts are universal. Hmm, so the other three are optional. So, the problem is about how many people own all four, given some information about exactly two and exactly three.

The problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. Wait, but first, let me note down all the given data.

Total residents, n = 900.

Let me denote the four sets as follows:

- Let A be the set of people who own a diamond ring.
- Let B be those who own a set of golf clubs.
- Let C be those who own a garden spade.
- Let D be those who own a bag of candy hearts.

Wait, but the problem says every resident owns D, so D is the universal set. So, the total number of residents is 900, and every resident is in D. So, |D| = 900.

The other sets A, B, C are subsets of D.

Now, the problem gives the sizes of A, B, C:

|A| = 195

|B| = 367

|C| = 562

Additionally, we're told that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. But wait, the problem says: 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, the 'these things' refer to the four items, including the candy hearts, I think. Because the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, perhaps when they say "exactly two of these things," they include the candy hearts.

Wait, but that's not possible because all 900 have the candy hearts. So, if someone owns exactly two things, and one of them is candy hearts, the other must be one of A, B, or C. Similarly, someone owning exactly three things would have candy hearts plus two of A, B, C.

But wait, alternatively, maybe the 'these things' refers only to the diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade. Hmm, the problem isn't entirely clear. Let me read it again.

"In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things."

Wait, the phrasing is a bit ambiguous. The first part says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which is in addition to the other items. So, when it says "exactly two of these things," it's referring to the four things: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Because the next part says "exactly three of these things," which would include the candy hearts as one of the three.

But wait, that can't be the case because if someone owns exactly two, one of them must be the candy hearts. Because otherwise, they would be owning two of the other three, but since the candy hearts are universal, everyone has them, so it's not possible to own exactly two without the candy hearts. So, perhaps the 'these things' includes the candy hearts.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade as the 'things' in question, and the candy hearts are just something everyone has. So, perhaps the 437 own exactly two of the three (A, B, C) and not considering D. Hmm, this is a crucial point.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says: "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, everyone has D. So, when they talk about someone owning exactly two, perhaps they are referring to exactly two among A, B, C, because D is already included in everyone.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem says "exactly two of these things," and "these things" refers to the four, including D. So, I think it's better to model it as the four sets A, B, C, D, where D is the universal set.

But then, the problem gives the exact numbers for A, B, C, but not D. So, the 'these things' includes all four.

Wait, but the problem says: "there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things." So, in the context, the 'these things' refers to diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts.

So, each resident owns D for sure. So, when someone owns exactly two of these, they must own D plus one of A, B, or C. Similarly, someone owning exactly three would have D plus two of A, B, C. And someone owning all four would have D plus all three of A, B, C.

Wait, but the problem says 437 own exactly two, which would mean D and one more, and 234 own exactly three, which would be D and two more. So, the people who own all four would be in the intersection of A, B, C, and D, which is just A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D, but since D is universal, it's just A ∩ B ∩ C.

Wait, but let me make sure. So, the problem is asking for the number of residents who own all four, which would be the intersection of A, B, C, and D. Since D is everyone, that's just the size of A ∩ B ∩ C.

Wait, no, because someone could own all four, but since D is universal, that's just the same as owning A, B, C. So, the number of people owning all four is the same as the size of A ∩ B ∩ C.

So, perhaps I can use inclusion-exclusion for four sets, but since D is universal, maybe it's a bit simpler.

Alternatively, maybe I can model it using three sets A, B, C, and D as the universal set.

Let me try to model this.

Each resident is in D, so |D|=900.

We have |A|=195, |B|=367, |C|=562.

We also know that:

- The number of residents owning exactly two of the four items: 437.

But wait, in this case, the four items include D, which is universal. So, if someone owns exactly two of the four, they must have D plus one of A, B, or C. Because D is already included in everyone.

Wait, but that would mean that the number of people owning exactly two things is the sum of the people who own D and exactly one other item. So, the 437 is the total number of people who have D plus exactly one of A, B, or C.

Similarly, the 234 is the number of people who have D plus exactly two of A, B, C.

And the number of people who have all four would be the number of people who have D and all three of A, B, C.

Wait, but then what about the rest? Because the total number of people is 900, so the sum of people owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and all four should add up to 900.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the number of people owning exactly one. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the only possibilities are owning exactly two, exactly three, or all four. But that might not be the case because it's possible that someone owns only D, but the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which is D. So, the minimal number of items someone can own is one (just D). But the problem doesn't give the number of people owning exactly one, so maybe I have to figure it out.

Let me think again.

Let me denote:

- Let x be the number of people owning exactly one of the four items. But since D is universal, can someone own exactly one item? Because D is already in everyone. So, no, because D is already included, but perhaps the problem counts only the other items. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as three sets A, B, C, and D being the universal set. So, each resident is in D, so when the problem refers to "these things," it's referring to A, B, C, and D.

So, the number of people owning exactly two of these four would be the number of people in exactly two of A, B, C, and D. But since D is universal, the only way to own exactly two is to be in D and exactly one of A, B, C.

Similarly, exactly three would be D and exactly two of A, B, C.

And exactly four would be D and all three of A, B, C.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the 437 is the number of people in exactly one of A, B, C, plus D. So, the exact two is the sum of the people in A only, B only, C only, plus D. Wait, no, because if you're in exactly two, you're in D and one of A, B, or C.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as:

The number of people owning exactly two of the four items is the sum of:

- People in A and D only.

- People in B and D only.

- People in C and D only.

So, these three groups make up the 437.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three of the four items is the sum of:

- People in A, B, and D.

- People in A, C, and D.

- People in B, C, and D.

So, these three groups make up the 234.

And the number of people owning all four items is the number of people in A, B, C, and D, which is the same as A ∩ B ∩ C, since D is universal.

Now, the problem is to find the number of people in A ∩ B ∩ C.

Let me denote:

Let’s denote:

- a = number of people owning only D: |only D| = a

- b = number of people owning exactly one of A, B, or C along with D. So, for example, |A only| = a1, |B only|=a2, |C only|=a3. Then, the total number of people owning exactly two items is 437, which would be:

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if someone owns exactly two items, and since D is one of them, then they must have D plus one of A, B, or C. So, the number of people owning exactly two items is the sum of the people in each of A, B, C, plus D, but not any of the others. So, that's the same as the sum of |A only|, |B only|, |C only|.

So, |A only| + |B only| + |C only| = 437.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three items is the sum of |A ∩ B|, |A ∩ C|, |B ∩ C|, but each of these intersections includes D as well. So, |A ∩ B| is the number of people in both A and B, which includes D, so it's actually |A ∩ B ∩ D|, which is the same as |A ∩ B| since D is universal.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the Venn diagram. Let me try to model this.

The total number of people is 900.

They can be partitioned into the following categories:

1. Only D: a

2. Exactly one of A, B, C along with D: b_A (only A and D), b_B (only B and D), b_C (only C and D)

3. Exactly two of A, B, C along with D: c_AB (A, B, D), c_AC (A, C, D), c_BC (B, C, D)

4. All three of A, B, C along with D: c_ABC

So, the number of people in exactly two of the four items is the sum of c_AB, c_AC, c_BC.

The number of people in exactly three of the four items is c_ABC.

Wait, but the problem states that 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. So, c_AB + c_AC + c_BC = 437

And c_ABC = 234?

Wait, no, wait. If 234 own exactly three of the four items, then that includes D, so it's the number of people in exactly three of A, B, C, and D. But since D is already present in everyone, the number of people owning exactly three is the number of people owning all three of A, B, C (since D is already included). So, c_ABC is the number of people owning all four, which is the same as the intersection of A, B, C, and D. But since D is universal, it's just A ∩ B ∩ C. So, c_ABC = 234.

Wait, but that can't be because the problem says 234 own exactly three of these things, which would be A, B, and C along with D, so that's the same as the intersection of A, B, C, and D, which is A ∩ B ∩ C.

Wait, but then if c_ABC = 234, that's the number of people owning all three of A, B, C, which along with D, makes four.

Wait, but wait, the problem says 234 own exactly three of these things, which would include D. So, if someone owns all three of A, B, C, and D, they're considered as owning exactly four things, not exactly three. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to clarify.

If someone owns exactly three of the four items, that would be three of A, B, C, D. But since D is included in everyone, someone can't own exactly three without D. So, the three items they own must include D plus two of A, B, C. So, the number of people owning exactly three is the number of people owning D and exactly two of A, B, C. So, that's the sum of the pairwise intersections of A, B, C, minus those who own all three.

Wait, maybe I need to model this more carefully.

Let me denote:

- Let’s denote the following:

  - Only D: a

  - Exactly one of A, B, C along with D: x, y, z

    So, x = number of people owning A and D only.

    y = number owning B and D only.

    z = number owning C and D only.

  - Exactly two of A, B, C along with D: p, q, r

    p = number owning A, B, D only.

    q = number owning A, C, D only.

    r = number owning B, C, D only.

  - All three of A, B, C along with D: s.

So, the total number of people is:

a + x + y + z + p + q + r + s = 900.

Now, the problem says that 437 people own exactly two of the four items. Which would be the sum of p, q, r.

Similarly, 234 people own exactly three of the four items, which would be s.

So, p + q + r = 437.

s = 234.

We also know that:

|A| = number of people owning A = x + p + q + s.

Similarly,

|B| = y + p + r + s.

|C| = z + q + r + s.

So, let me write down the equations:

1. a + x + y + z + p + q + r + s = 900.

2. p + q + r = 437.

3. s = 234.

4. |A| = x + p + q + s = 195.

5. |B| = y + p + r + s = 367.

6. |C| = z + q + r + s = 562.

We have six equations with variables a, x, y, z, p, q, r, s.

But we're looking for s, which is 234. Wait, no, s is given as 234. So, maybe we can find the other variables.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the number of people who own all four items, which is s. But s is given as 234 in the problem? Wait, no, the problem says 234 own exactly three of these things, which in our model is s. So, s is 234. So, the number of people owning all four is s, which is 234. But that can't be correct because if 234 own all four, then the total number of people owning A, B, C would be higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Let me think again.

Wait, when someone owns exactly three of the four items, including D, that means they own D plus two of A, B, C. So, the number of people owning exactly three is the sum of those owning A, B, D only; A, C, D only; and B, C, D only. So, that's p + q + r = 234.

Wait, but the problem says 234 own exactly three, so p + q + r = 234.

And the problem says 437 own exactly two, so that's the sum of those owning exactly two of A, B, C plus D. So, that's x + y + z = 437.

Wait, no, perhaps I have to clarify:

Wait, exactly two of the four items would be:

- A and D only (x)

- B and D only (y)

- C and D only (z)

So, x + y + z = 437.

Exactly three would be owning A, B, D only (p), A, C, D only (q), B, C, D only (r). So, p + q + r = 234.

And those owning all four would be s.

Wait, but then the number of people owning all four is s, which is the intersection of A, B, C, D. But since D is universal, s is just the size of A ∩ B ∩ C.

So, the problem is to find s.

So, given that, let's write down the equations again.

We have:

1. a + x + y + z + p + q + r + s = 900.

2. x + y + z = 437.

3. p + q + r = 234.

4. |A| = x + p + q + s = 195.

5. |B| = y + p + r + s = 367.

6. |C| = z + q + r + s = 562.

We need to find s.

From equation 2, we can write x + y + z = 437.

From equation 3, p + q + r = 234.

So, total of equations 2 and 3: x + y + z + p + q + r = 437 + 234 = 671.

Now, equation 1 is a + (x + y + z + p + q + r) + s = 900.

Substituting, a + 671 + s = 900 => a = 900 - 671 - s => a = 229 - s.

Now, let's look at equations 4,5,6.

Equation 4: x + p + q + s = 195.

Equation 5: y + p + r + s = 367.

Equation 6: z + q + r + s = 562.

Let me add equations 4,5,6:

(x + p + q + s) + (y + p + r + s) + (z + q + r + s) = 195 + 367 + 562.

Simplify the left side:

x + y + z + 2p + 2q + 2r + 3s = 1124.

From equation 2, x + y + z =437.

From equation 3, p + q + r =234.

So, substituting:

437 + 2*(234) + 3s = 1124.

Calculate:

437 + 468 + 3s = 1124.

So, 905 + 3s = 1124.

3s = 1124 - 905 = 219.

So, s = 219 / 3 = 73.

So, s is 73. So, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.

Wait, let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

From equation 4,5,6, sum them:

(195) + (367) + (562) = 1124.

Left side: x + y + z + 2p + 2q + 2r + 3s.

We know x + y + z =437.

p + q + r =234, so 2*(p+q+r)=468.

So, 437 + 468 + 3s = 905 + 3s.

Set equal to 1124: 905 +3s=1124 → 3s=219 → s=73.

Yes, that looks correct.

So, the answer is 73.


To solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets. We denote the four items as follows:

- A: Diamond ring owners
- B: Golf clubs owners
- C: Garden spade owners
- D: Bag of candy hearts (universal set, so |D| = 900)

We are given:

- |A| = 195
- |B| = 367
- |C| = 562
- 437 residents own exactly two of the four items.
- 234 residents own exactly three of the four items.

We need to find the number of residents who own all four items, which is the intersection of A, B, C, and D. Since D is universal, this is equivalent to |A ∩ B ∩ C|.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let s = |A ∩ B ∩ C| (number of residents owning all four items).
   - Let p, q, r be the number of residents owning exactly three items (A∩B, A∩C, B∩C respectively).
   - Let x, y, z be the number of residents owning exactly two items (A, B, C respectively with D).
   - Let a be the number of residents owning only D.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Total residents: a + x + y + z + p + q + r + s = 900.
   - Residents owning exactly two items: x + y + z = 437.
   - Residents owning exactly three items: p + q + r = 234.
   - |A| = x + p + q + s = 195.
   - |B| = y + p + r + s = 367.
   - |C| = z + q + r + s = 562.

3. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - From x + y + z = 437 and p + q + r = 234, we find x + y + z + p + q + r = 671.
   - Substitute into the total residents equation: a + 671 + s = 900 ⇒ a = 229 - s.
   - Sum the equations for |A|, |B|, and |C|: (x + p + q + s) + (y + p + r + s) + (z + q + r + s) = 195 + 367 + 562.
   - Simplify: x + y + z + 2p + 2q + 2r + 3s = 1124.
   - Substitute x + y + z = 437 and p + q + r = 234: 437 + 2(234) + 3s = 1124 ⇒ 437 + 468 + 3s = 1124 ⇒ 905 + 3s = 1124 ⇒ 3s = 219 ⇒ s = 73.

### Final Answer:
The number of residents who own all four items is \(\boxed{73}\).
