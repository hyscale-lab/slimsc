Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, meaning they all lie on the same straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.

Hmm, rectangles have opposite sides equal and all angles are right angles. So, for rectangle ABCD, AB is 107, BC is 16. That means CD is also 16, and DA is 107. For rectangle EFGH, EF is 184, FG is 17, so GH is 17, and HE is 184.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, the line DEF C is a straight line. So, E is between D and F, and F is between E and C? Or maybe the order is different. Hmm, I think I need to figure out the order of these points on the line.

Wait, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. So the order is D, E, C, F. So the points go from D to E to C to F on a straight line. So DE is a segment, EC is another, and CF is another.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting. Since A, D, H, G are concyclic, the quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. So that might imply some properties from cyclic quadrilaterals, like the sum of opposite angles is 180 degrees, or maybe using power of a point.

Let me sketch this in my mind. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB = 107, BC = 16. So it's a tall rectangle. Rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184, FG =17, so it's a much longer but narrower rectangle.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, and it's a straight line, the sides of the rectangles must be arranged such that this line is a common side or something. Wait, maybe not. Let me see.

Since ABCD is a rectangle, AD is 107, and DC is 16. EFGH is another rectangle, with FG=17, so GH=17, EF=184, so EH=184.

Hmmm. Points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So A is a corner of ABCD, D is another corner, H is a corner of EFGH, and G is another corner. So, their positions relative to each other might form a cyclic quadrilateral.

Wait, maybe the two rectangles are placed such that their sides are on the same line, and their other sides are connected in a way that points lie on a circle.

Alternatively, perhaps the line DEF C is a common side or something. Hmm, but DE, EC, CF are parts of that line.

Wait, perhaps I should assign coordinates to the points to make this more concrete.

Let me choose a coordinate system where point D is at the origin (0, 0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, and D is at (0,0), point C would be at (16, 0) because DC is 16. Point B would be at (0, 107), and point A at (16, 107).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If ABCD is a rectangle, then AB is 107, BC is 16. So, if D is at (0,0), then C is at (16,0), B is at (0,16), but that doesn't make AB
