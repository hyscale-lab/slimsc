Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at points B and C to the circle ω intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find the length AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then compute m + n.

Hmm, let me visualize the problem. Triangle ABC has sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. So, ABC is a triangle with sides 5, 9, 10. Let me check if it's a right-angled triangle. Let's see: 5² + 9² = 25 + 81 = 106, which is not equal to 10²=100. So, it's not a right-angled triangle. Okay.

So, the triangle is inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, line AD intersects ω again at P. We need to find AP.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point outside a circle, the lengths from that point to the points of tangency are equal. So, in this case, DB and DC are tangents from D to ω, so DB = DC. So, D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC, perhaps? Or maybe D is the ex-symmedian point? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, perhaps D is the ex-pole or something related. Maybe using power of a point could help here.

Power of a point D with respect to ω: since D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, the power of D is DB² = DC² = (tangent length)^2. Also, since AD intersects ω at P, then by power of point A with respect to ω, we have AP * AD = power of A? Wait, no. Wait, A is on ω, so the power of A is zero. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Power of a Point theorem for point D. The power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC². Since AD passes through D and intersects ω at A and P, then the power of D with respect to ω is also equal to DP * DA. So, we can write:

DB² = DP * DA

So, DP = DB² / DA

But we don't know DA yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can use some properties of harmonic division or cross ratios. Alternatively, coordinate geometry could be an approach, but that might get messy. Alternatively, using inversion might simplify things, but that might be overkill.

Wait, perhaps using Menelaus'
