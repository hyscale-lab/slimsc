Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, let's write down what's given. We have a linear equation and a quadratic equation involving a, b, and c. Both equations are symmetric in a, b, and c, which probably means that symmetry could play a role in solving it. I remember that sometimes, for symmetric equations, substitution or factoring might help.

Let me think about the first equation: a + b + c = 300. That's straightforward. The second equation looks more complicated: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow.

Looking at the terms, I notice that each term is a product of two variables multiplied by the square of another. For instance, a²b and a²c both have a² as a factor. Similarly, the same applies to b² and c² terms. Maybe I can factor out a², b², or c² from their respective terms.

Wait, let's see: a²b + a²c = a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b = c²(a + b). So I can rewrite the entire expression as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

That looks a bit better. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c into the equation. Let's try that.

So, substituting, the equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that might make things easier. Let me write that as:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

So, simplifying, we get:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm. I wonder if there's a way to relate a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ to a + b + c. I know that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c = 300, we can find ab + bc + ca if we know a² + b² + c².

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = a² + b² + c², and P = ab + bc + ca. Then, from the identity, S² = Q + 2P, so 300² = Q + 2P, which gives 90,000 = Q + 2P. So, Q = 90,000 - 2P. Hmm, that might be useful.

Now, going back to the equation we had earlier: 300Q - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000. Let me denote C = a³ + b³ + c³. So, 300Q - C = 6,000,000. We can express this as C = 300Q - 6,000,000.

But I need to express C in terms of S, Q, and P. I remember that there is an identity for a³ + b³ + c³. Let me recall: a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So, using that, C = S³ - 3S P + 3abc.

Substituting S = 300, that gives C = 300³ - 3*300*P + 3abc. Let me compute 300³: 300*300 = 90,000, so 90,000*300 = 27,000,000. So, C = 27,000,000 - 900 P + 3abc.

Now, going back to the earlier equation, C = 300Q - 6,000,000. So, substituting:

27,000,000 - 900 P + 3abc = 300Q - 6,000,000.

But we know Q = 90,000 - 2P, so substituting that in:

27,000,000 - 900 P + 3abc = 300*(90,000 - 2P) - 6,000,000.

Let me compute the right-hand side: 300*90,000 = 27,000,000, and 300*(-2P) = -600 P. So, right-hand side becomes 27,000,000 - 600 P - 6,000,000 = 21,000,000 - 600 P.

So, putting it all together:

27,000,000 - 900 P + 3abc = 21,000,000 - 600 P.

Let's subtract 21,000,000 from both sides:

6,000,000 - 900 P + 3abc = -600 P.

Hmm, let's bring all terms to one side:

6,000,000 - 900 P + 3abc + 600 P = 0.

Combining like terms: 6,000,000 - 300 P + 3abc = 0.

Let me write that as:

3abc - 300 P = -6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

abc - 100 P = -2,000,000.

Hmm, so we have:

abc = 100 P - 2,000,000.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's helpful yet. Let's think about what variables we have. We have S = 300, Q = 90,000 - 2P, and C = 27,000,000 - 900 P + 3abc.

But perhaps another approach would be better. Maybe we can express everything in terms of two variables instead of three, since a + b + c = 300.

Let's let c = 300 - a - b. Then, substitute this into the second equation. That might get messy, but perhaps manageable.

So, substituting c = 300 - a - b into the second equation:

a²b + a²(300 - a - b) + b²a + b²(300 - a - b) + (300 - a - b)²a + (300 - a - b)²b = 6,000,000.

Wait, that's a lot of terms. Let's try expanding each term step by step.

First term: a²b.

Second term: a²(300 - a - b) = 300a² - a³ - a²b.

Third term: b²a.

Fourth term: b²(300 - a - b) = 300b² - a b² - b³.

Fifth term: (300 - a - b)²a. Let me expand (300 - a - b)² first:

(300 - a - b)^2 = (300)^2 - 2
