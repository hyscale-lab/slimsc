Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I know that z is a complex number with magnitude 4. That means z can be written in the form z = 4e^{iθ}, right? Because any complex number with magnitude r can be expressed as r times e raised to i times the angle θ. So θ is the argument of z. So maybe I can represent z as 4e^{iθ} and proceed from there.

Let me write down the expression again: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Substituting z = 4e^{iθ}, we get (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ}).

Wait, that denominator in the second term is e^{iθ}, so dividing by that is the same as multiplying by e^{-iθ}. So the second term becomes (96 + 144i)* (1/(4e^{iθ})) = (96 + 144i)/4 * e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

So now the entire expression becomes (75 + 117i)*4 e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute what (75 + 117i) * 4 is. 75*4 = 300, and 117*4 = 468, so that term is 300 + 468i. So the expression simplifies to (300 + 468i) e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

Now, I can express each of these terms using Euler's formula. Remember that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So let's compute the first term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ). Similarly, the second term is (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Let me multiply these out.

First term expansion:
(300)(cosθ) + (300)(i sinθ) + (468i)(cosθ) + (468i)(i sinθ)
= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468 i^2 sinθ
But i^2 = -1, so this becomes:
300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ

Similarly, second term expansion:
(24)(cosθ) + (24)(-i sinθ) + (36i)(cosθ) + (36i)(-i sinθ)
= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ
Again, i^2 = -1, so:
24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ

Now, let's combine the real and imaginary parts for each term.

First term real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ
First term imaginary part: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i

Second term real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
Second term imaginary part: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i

So the entire expression's real part is (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ), and the imaginary part is (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ), all multiplied by i.

But since the problem asks for the largest possible real part, we can focus on the real part.

So let's compute the real part:

Real part = (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Hmm, so we have Real part = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

We need to find the maximum value of this expression as θ varies. So I need to find the maximum of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

I remember that expressions of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be rewritten as C cos(θ + φ), where C = sqrt(A² + B²), and tanφ = B/A or something like that. Wait, actually, isn't it A cosθ + B sinθ = C cos(θ - φ), where C is sqrt(A^2 + B^2), and φ is such that cosφ = A/C and sinφ = B/C.

Wait, let me think. The identity is A cosθ + B sinθ = C cos(θ - φ), where C = sqrt(A² + B²), and φ is an angle such that cosφ = A/C and sinφ = B/C.

Wait, or is it sinφ = B/C? Let me verify.

Suppose A cosθ + B sinθ = C cos(θ - φ). Then expanding the right-hand side: C cosθ cosφ + C sinθ sinφ. So matching coefficients, A = C cosφ and B = C sinφ. So yes, A = C cosφ, B = C sinφ. Therefore, tanφ = B/A, and C = sqrt(A² + B²).

Wait, but in our case, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, so it's A cosθ + B sinθ where A = 324 and B = -432.

So, C = sqrt(324² + (-432)^2). Let's compute that.

Compute 324²: 324 * 324. Let's see, 300² = 90,000, 24²=576, and cross term 2*300*24=14,400. So (300 +24)^2= 300² + 2*300*24 +24² = 90,000 +14,400 +576= 104,976.

Similarly, 432²: 432 is 400 + 32. So (400 +32)^2=400² + 2*400*32 +32²= 160,000 +25,600 +1,024= 186,624. But since B is -432, the square is same as 432², so 186,624.

So C = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600). Let's compute that.

Well, 540² is 291,600 because 500² = 250,000, 40²=1,600, cross term 2*500*40=40,000, so (500+40)^2= 500² + 2*500*40 +40²=250,000 +40,000 +1,600=291,600. So C=540.

So, 324 cosθ -432 sinθ = 540 cos(θ - φ), where φ is such that cosφ = 324/540 and sinφ = -432/540.

Simplify those fractions:

324/540 = (324 ÷ 108)/(540 ÷ 108)=3/5.

Similarly, -432/540 = (-432 ÷ 108)/(540 ÷ 108)= -4/5.

So cosφ = 3/5, sinφ = -4/5. Thus, φ is in the fourth quadrant. The angle whose cosine is 3/5 and sine is -4/5.

Therefore, the expression 324 cosθ -432 sinθ can be written as 540 cos(θ - φ). The maximum value of this is 540, since cosine function varies between -1 and 1. So the maximum value of the real part is 540.

Wait, so is that the final answer? Wait, let me just make sure.

Wait, but I had Real part = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ = 540 cos(θ - φ). So the maximum value is 540 when cos(θ - φ) = 1, which occurs when θ = φ. So yes, the maximum real part is 540.

But wait, just to make sure, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through the steps again.

We had:

(75 + 117i) z + (96 + 144i)/z, with |z|=4. So we wrote z as 4 e^{iθ}.

Then, (75 + 117i) *4 e^{iθ} is (300 + 468i) e^{iθ}.

Then (96 + 144i)/(4 e^{iθ}) is (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

So the expression is (300 + 468i) e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

Then, expanding each term using Euler's formula, we get:

First term: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ as the real part, and 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ as the imaginary part.

Second term: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ as the real part, and -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ as the imaginary part.

Adding the real parts: (300 cosθ -468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ +36 sinθ) = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Similarly, adding the imaginary parts: (300 sinθ +468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ +36 cosθ) = (300 -24) sinθ + (468 +36) cosθ = 276 sinθ +504 cosθ.

But since we're only interested in the real part, which is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

We converted that to 540 cos(θ - φ), where φ is such that cosφ = 324/540 = 3/5, sinφ = -432/540 = -4/5. So φ is an angle in the fourth quadrant.

The maximum of 540 cos(θ - φ) is 540, so the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, so that's the answer. But let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using more algebraic methods.

Another approach: Let me write z as 4 e^{iθ} as before. Let me denote w = z, so |w|=4.

Then the expression is (75 + 117i) w + (96 + 144i)/w.

Let me compute each term:

(75 +117i) w = (75 +117i) *4 e^{iθ} = 4(75 +117i) e^{iθ}.

(96 +144i)/w = (96 +144i)/(4 e^{iθ}) = (24 +36i) e^{-iθ}.

So the expression is 4(75 +117i) e^{iθ} + (24 +36i) e^{-iθ}.

Let me denote a = 75 +117i, b = (96 +144i)/4 = 24 + 36i. So the expression is 4 a e^{iθ} + b e^{-iθ}.

We can write this as 4 a e^{iθ} + b e^{-iθ}.

Let me write this as 4 a e^{iθ} + b e^{-iθ} = 4 a e^{iθ} + b e^{-iθ}.

To find the real part, we can compute Re(4 a e^{iθ} + b e^{-iθ}).

Alternatively, perhaps we can write this as 4 a e^{iθ} + b e^{-iθ} = c e^{iθ} + d e^{-iθ}, where c and d are complex numbers.

But maybe it's easier to think in terms of the expression's real part.

Alternatively, perhaps we can represent the entire expression as a complex number and then find its real part.

Wait, but maybe we can write the expression as 4 a e^{iθ} + b e^{-iθ} and then let's compute the real part.

But perhaps another approach is to write the expression as (75 +117i) z + (96 +144i)/z, with |z|=4.

Let me write w = z, so |w|=4. So the expression becomes (75 +117i) w + (96 +144i)/w.

Let me denote A = 75 +117i, B = 96 +144i.

So expression is A w + B /w.

We can write this as A w + B /w = A w + (B \overline{w}) / |w|^2, since 1/w = \overline{w}/|w|^2. Since |w|=4, |w|^2 = 16.

So expression becomes A w + (B \overline{w}) /16.

Which is A w + (B/16) \overline{w}.

So, expression is A w + (B/16) \overline{w}.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps we can write this as a function of w and express it in terms of real and imaginary parts.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write w = x + iy, but since |w| =4, x² + y²=16.

But that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that Re(A w + B /w) can be expressed in terms of real variables.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to note that for any complex number a and b, Re(a w + b \overline{w}) can be expressed in terms of the real and imaginary parts.

Wait, let me try that.

Suppose a = A, b = B/16.

Then, expression is a w + b \overline{w}.

Then, Re(a w + b \overline{w}) = Re(a w) + Re(b \overline{w}).

But Re(b \overline{w}) = Re(b \overline{w}) = Re( \overline{b w} ) = Re(b w).

Wait, no, because Re(b \overline{w}) = Re( \overline{b w} ) = Re(b w), since Re(z) = Re(\overline{z}).

So Re(a w + b \overline{w}) = Re(a w) + Re(b w).

So the real part is Re( (a + b) w ).

Wait, is that correct? Wait, no, because a and b are different. Wait, perhaps not. Let me double-check.

Wait, Re(a w) + Re(b \overline{w}) = Re(a w) + Re( \overline{ b w } ) = Re(a w) + Re(b w).

So that's Re(a w) + Re(b w) = Re( (a + b) w ).

Hmm, that seems to be correct. So, Re(a w + b \overline{w}) = Re( (a + b) w ).

Wait, but let me test this with a simple example. Let a = 1, b = 1, w = 1 + i.

Then a w = (1)(1 + i) = 1 + i. b \overline{w} = 1*(1 -i) = 1 -i. So Re(a w + b \overline{w}) = Re( (1 + i) + (1 -i) )= Re(2) = 2.

On the other hand, Re( (a + b) w ) = Re( (2)(1 +i) )= Re(2 + 2i )= 2. So in this case, it works.

So, perhaps this identity holds: Re(a w + b \overline{w}) = Re( (a + b) w ). So, if that's the case, then the real part is Re( (a + b) w ), where a = A and b = B/|w|².

Wait, but in our case, a = A =75 +117i, and b = B /16 = (96 +144i)/16 = 6 + 9i.

So a + b = (75 +6) + (117i +9i) =81 + 126i.

So Re( (a + b) w ) = Re( (81 +126i) w ).

But w = z =4 e^{iθ}, so Re( (81 +126i) *4 e^{iθ} ) = Re( 4*(81 +126i) e^{iθ} ).

We can compute 4*(81 +126i) = 324 + 504i.

So the expression becomes Re( (324 + 504i) e^{iθ} ).

Now, e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, so (324 +504i)(cosθ +i sinθ) = 324 cosθ +324 i sinθ +504i cosθ +504 i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 = -1, so this becomes 324 cosθ + 324i sinθ +504i cosθ -504 sinθ.

So the real part is 324 cosθ - 504 sinθ.

Wait, but earlier when I computed the real part, I got 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. Now, I'm getting 324 cosθ -504 sinθ. That's a discrepancy. So perhaps my previous approach was wrong.

Wait, but where did I go wrong?

Wait, let me check again. When I wrote the expression as Re(a w + b \overline{w}), I might have made a mistake. Let's rederive it properly.

Let me write expression E = a w + b \overline{w}.

Then, Re(E) = Re(a w) + Re(b \overline{w}).

Now, Re(b \overline{w}) = Re( \overline{ b w } ) because \overline{w} = conjugate of w. So \overline{w} = x - iy if w =x + iy.

So, Re(b \overline{w}) = Re( \overline{b w} ) = Re(b w^*), where w^* is the conjugate of w.

But Re(b w^*) = Re( \overline{b w} ) = Re(b w) because Re(z) = Re( \overline{z} ).

Wait, is that correct? Wait, let me take an example. Let b = 1 + i, w = 2 + 3i.

Then, Re(b w^*) = Re( (1 + i)(2 - 3i) ) = Re( 2 -3i +2i -3i^2 ) = Re(2 - i +3 ) = Re(5 - i) =5.

Re(b w) = Re( (1 +i)(2 +3i) )= Re(2 +3i +2i +3i² )= Re(2 +5i -3 )= Re(-1 +5i )= -1.

So Re(b w^*) =5, Re(b w)= -1. So they are not equal. So my initial assumption was wrong.

Therefore, Re(b \overline{w}) ≠ Re(b w). So, the approach I took earlier that Re(a w + b \overline{w})= Re( (a + b) w ) is incorrect.

Hence, I can't use that identity. I must have made a mistake in that approach.

So, going back to the first approach, where I expanded everything and found the real part to be 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which I converted to 540 cos(θ - φ), giving a maximum of 540.

But now, when I did the alternative approach, I ended up with a different real part, 324 cosθ -504 sinθ. So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the alternative approach. Let me re-examine that.

In the alternative approach, I wrote E = (75 +117i) w + (96 +144i)/w. Then, since |w|=4, 1/w = \overline{w}/16. So E = A w + B \overline{w}/16, where A =75 +117i, B=96 +144i.

So E = A w + (B/16) \overline{w}.

Then, I thought of this as a w + b \overline{w}, where a = A and b = B/16.

Then, I tried to compute Re(a w + b \overline{w}) and thought that was Re( (a + b) w ), but that's not correct, as shown by the counterexample.

So perhaps I shouldn't have done that. Therefore, that approach was wrong, and I should stick with the first method.

So, the correct real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which can be written as 540 cos(θ - φ), with maximum value 540.

Wait, but let me confirm this by another method.

Another approach: Let me parametrize z as 4 e^{iθ}. Then, compute the real part as Re( (75 +117i) z + (96 +144i)/z ), which is Re( (75 +117i) *4 e^{iθ} + (96 +144i)/(4 e^{iθ}) ).

Which is Re( (300 +468i) e^{iθ} + (24 +36i) e^{-iθ} ), as I did earlier.

Then, expanding each term:

(300 +468i)(cosθ +i sinθ) = 300 cosθ -468 sinθ + i(300 sinθ +468 cosθ).

Similarly, (24 +36i)(cosθ -i sinθ) =24 cosθ +36 sinθ +i(36 cosθ -24 sinθ).

Adding the real parts: 300 cosθ -468 sinθ +24 cosθ +36 sinθ = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Imaginary parts: (300 sinθ +468 cosθ) + (36 cosθ -24 sinθ) = 300 sinθ -24 sinθ +468 cosθ +36 cosθ = 276 sinθ +504 cosθ.

So the real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. So that's correct.

So, to find the maximum of 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which is an expression of the form A cosθ + B sinθ, but since it's A cosθ + B sinθ where B is negative, it's A cosθ - |B| sinθ.

The maximum of such an expression is sqrt(A² + B²), which in this case is sqrt(324² + (-432)^2)=sqrt(104976 + 186624)=sqrt(291600)=540.

So, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, so why did the other approach give me a different expression? Because I made a mistake in that approach. So I should stick with the first approach.

Hence, the largest possible real part is 540.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Express \(z\) in polar form**:  
   Since \(|z| = 4\), we can write \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), where \(\theta\) is the argument of \(z\).

2. **Substitute \(z\) into the expression**:  
   The given expression becomes:
   \[
   (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}.
   \]
   Simplifying each term:
   \[
   (75 + 117i) \cdot 4 = 300 + 468i,
   \]
   \[
   \frac{96 + 144i}{4} = 24 + 36i.
   \]
   Thus, the expression becomes:
   \[
   (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}.
   \]

3. **Expand using Euler's formula**:  
   Using \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\), we expand the terms:
   \[
   (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta),
   \]
   \[
   (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta + i(36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta).
   \]

4. **Combine real and imaginary parts**:  
   Adding the real parts:
   \[
   300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
   \]
   The imaginary parts combine separately but are not needed for the real part.

5. **Maximize the real part**:  
   The real part is \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\), which can be rewritten as:
   \[
   R\cos(\theta - \phi),
   \]
   where \(R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = 540\), and \(\phi\) is an angle such that \(\cos\phi = \frac{324}{540} = \frac{3}{5}\) and \(\sin\phi = \frac{-432}{540} = -\frac{4}{5}\). The maximum value of \(R\cos(\theta - \phi)\) is \(R\), which is \(540\).

Thus, the largest possible real part of the given expression is:

\[
\boxed{540}
\]
