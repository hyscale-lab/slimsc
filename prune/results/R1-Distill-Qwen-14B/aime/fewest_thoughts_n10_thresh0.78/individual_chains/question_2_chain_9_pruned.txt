Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis in the first quadrant. We need to find a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that isn't on any other segment from F except AB itself. Then, we have to find OC² and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, then find p+q.

First, let me visualize this. O is the origin. A is halfway between O and (1,0), right? Because 1/2 is halfway to 1 on the x-axis. Similarly, B is somewhere on the y-axis, but only sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866, so it's somewhere between O and (0,1). So AB is a line segment connecting (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). That should form a line, and C is a point on this line.

Now, the family F consists of these segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1. Since P is on the x-axis, let's denote P as (p, 0) and Q as (0, q). The distance between P and Q is sqrt( (p)^2 + (q)^2 ) = 1, so p² + q² = 1.

But since all these segments are in the first quadrant, p and q are positive. So, any segment PQ in F connects (p,0) to (0,q) where p² + q² = 1.

Now, the problem says that C is on AB and is not on any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is one such segment in F because OA is from (0,0) to (1/2,0), and OB is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Wait, no, AB is from A(1/2,0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the length of AB.

The distance between A and B is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So AB is a segment of length 1, which means AB is indeed in the family F.

So, AB is one of the segments in F. But C is another point on AB, besides A and B, that isn't on any other segment from F. So, we have to find such a point C on AB so that it doesn't lie on any other PQ in F except for AB itself.

Hmm. So, perhaps the idea is that C is the point on AB that is the closest to O or something like that? Or maybe it's where AB is tangent to some curve related to F.

Wait, another approach. Since all segments PQ in F have length 1 and are from the x-axis to y-axis, they form a kind of envelope. The set of all such segments might form a curve, and AB is one of them. The point C would be the point where AB is the only segment in F that passes through it. So, maybe C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of all these segments.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize F and find the envelope. Let me think.

Let’s parametrize the segments PQ. Let’s say P is (p,0) and Q is (0,q), with p² + q² = 1, so q = sqrt(1 - p²). The equation of the line PQ can be found. The line from (p,0) to (0,q) has slope (q - 0)/(0 - p) = -q/p. The equation is:

y = (-q/p)x + q.

Alternatively, since it's a line connecting (p,0) and (0,q), its equation can also be written as x/p + y/q = 1.

So, for each p in (0,1), we have a line x/p + y/q = 1, where q = sqrt(1 - p²). So, each line is determined by p.

Our goal is to find the envelope of all these lines. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each of these lines. So, if we can find the envelope, then AB is one of these lines, and C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope.

Wait, but AB is a specific line in F. So, maybe all these lines PQ form a region, and AB is a boundary line. The point C is the point where AB is the only line in F that passes through it, meaning it's a point of tangency.

So, to find the envelope, we can use the method of finding where the line and its derivative with respect to p meet.

Let me recall that the envelope of a family of curves given by F(x, y, p) = 0 satisfies both F(x, y, p) = 0 and dF/dp = 0.

So, let's express the equation of the line PQ as F(x, y, p) = 0.

From the equation x/p + y/q = 1, and since q = sqrt(1 - p²), we can write:

F(x, y, p) = x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p²) - 1 = 0.

So, F(x, y, p) = x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p²) - 1.

Now, we can compute dF/dp and set it to zero.

Compute the derivative:

dF/dp = derivative of x/p is -x/p², derivative of y/sqrt(1 - p²) is y*(1/2)(1 - p²)^(-3/2)*(2p) = y*p/(1 - p²)^(3/2). So,

dF/dp = (-x)/p² + (y * p)/(1 - p²)^(3/2) = 0.

So, we have two equations:

1. x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p²) = 1
2. (-x)/p² + (y * p)/(1 - p²)^(3/2) = 0

We can solve these two equations for x and y in terms of p.

Let me denote sqrt(1 - p²) as q for simplicity. So, q = sqrt(1 - p²), which implies p² + q² = 1.

Then equation 1 becomes:

x/p + y/q = 1.

Equation 2 becomes:

(-x)/p² + (y p)/q³ = 0.

So, we have:

Equation 1: x/p + y/q = 1

Equation 2: (-x)/p² + (y p)/q³ = 0

Let me solve equation 1 for x:

x = p (1 - y/q )

Plugging into equation 2:

- [ p (1 - y/q ) ] / p² + (y p)/q³ = 0

Simplify:

- (1 - y/q ) / p + (y p)/q³ = 0

Multiply through by p to eliminate the denominator:

- (1 - y/q ) + (y p²)/q³ = 0

But p² = 1 - q², so substitute:

- (1 - y/q ) + y (1 - q²)/q³ = 0

Let me distribute the terms:

-1 + y/q + y (1 - q²)/q³ = 0

Factor out y:

-1 + y [ 1/q + (1 - q²)/q³ ] = 0

Compute the expression inside the brackets:

1/q + (1 - q²)/q³ = ( q² + 1 - q² ) / q³ = 1/q³.

Wait, let me check that:

1/q = q²/q³, so 1/q + (1 - q²)/q³ = q²/q³ + (1 - q²)/q³ = (q² + 1 - q²)/q³ = 1/q³.

So, the equation becomes:

-1 + y / q³ = 0 => y = q³.

So, from equation 1, x = p (1 - y/q ) = p (1 - q² )

But since q² = 1 - p², x = p (1 - (1 - p²)) = p (p² ) = p³.

So, we have x = p³ and y = q³ = (sqrt(1 - p² ))^3 = (1 - p² )^(3/2).

So, the envelope is parametrized by x = p³, y = (1 - p² )^(3/2 ), for p in (0,1).

Alternatively, we can write it in terms of x and y without p.

Since x = p³, p = x^(1/3).

Then y = (1 - (x^(1/3))² )^(3/2 ) = (1 - x^(2/3) )^(3/2 ).

So, the envelope is y = (1 - x^(2/3) )^(3/2 ).

So, the envelope is this curve.

Now, AB is the line from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's find the equation of AB.

The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2 ) = (sqrt(3)/2 ) / (-1/2 ) = -sqrt(3).

So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3) x + c. Since it passes through A(1/2, 0), plug in:

0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2 ) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2.

So, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, since AB is a member of family F, and it's part of the envelope, but according to the problem, C is a point on AB that is not on any other segment from F except AB itself. So, C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope.

Wait, but the envelope is the boundary of the region covered by all segments in F. So, for AB to be tangent to the envelope, it must touch the envelope at exactly one point.

Wait, but AB is already a segment in F, so perhaps C is the point where AB touches the envelope, making it the only point where AB meets the envelope, hence C is not on any other segment in F.

So, to find C, we can solve the system where AB meets the envelope.

So, the envelope is y = (1 - x^(2/3) )^(3/2 ), and AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, set them equal:

(1 - x^(2/3) )^(3/2 ) = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3
