Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.

First, I know that \( z \) is a complex number, and its magnitude is 4. That means \( z \) can be written in the form \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). Alternatively, it can also be written as \( z = a + bi \), but using the polar form might make things easier because of the magnitude.

Since \( |z| = 4 \), the reciprocal \( 1/z \) will have a magnitude of \( 1/4 \). So, \( 1/z = \frac{\overline{z}}{|z|^2} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \), because \( |z|^2 = 16 \) when \( |z| = 4 \). That might come in handy later.

Let me rewrite the expression with \( z \) and \( 1/z \) in polar form. Let's denote \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). Then \( 1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \).

Substituting these into the original expression:

\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i) \cdot \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]

Simplify each term:

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} \)
Let me compute \( (75 + 117i) \times 4 \):
\( 75 \times 4 = 300 \)
\( 117 \times 4 = 468 \)
So the first term becomes \( 300 + 468i \) multiplied by \( e^{i\theta} \).

Second term: \( (96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \)
Compute \( (96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4} \):
\( 96 / 4 = 24 \)
\( 144 / 4 = 36 \)
So the second term becomes \( 24 + 36i \) multiplied by \( e^{-i\theta} \).

So now the expression is:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Now, I need to compute this expression and find its real part, then maximize it with respect to \( \theta \).

Let me write \( e^{i\theta} \) as \( \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} \) as \( \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

Substituting these into the expression:

First term: \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
Second term: \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)

Let me multiply these out.

First term expansion:
= \( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta \)
Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this becomes:
= \( 300\cos\theta + (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i - 468\sin\theta \)

Second term expansion:
= \( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta \)
Again, \( i^2 = -1 \), so:
= \( 24\cos\theta + (36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta)i + 36\sin\theta \)

Now, let's combine the real and imaginary parts separately.

Real parts from first term: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)
Imaginary parts from first term: \( (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i \)

Real parts from second term: \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)
Imaginary parts from second term: \( (36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta)i \)

So adding real parts together:

Real total = \( (300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) \)
= \( (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta \)
= \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

Imaginary total = \( (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta + 36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta)i \)
= \( (300\sin\theta - 24\sin\theta) + (468\cos\theta + 36\cos\theta) \)i
= \( 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta \)i

So the entire expression is:

\( [324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta] + [276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta]i \)

But since we're only interested in the real part, we can focus on:

\( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

Our goal is to maximize this real part with respect to \( \theta \).

So, we have \( f(\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). We need to find the maximum value of \( f(\theta) \).

I recall that expressions of the form \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) can be rewritten as \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \) where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). The maximum value of such an expression is \( R \), since the cosine function is bounded between -1 and 1.

Wait, actually, let's see: if it's \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta = R\cos(\theta - \phi) \) where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \), and \( \phi = \arctan(b/a) \) or something like that. So the maximum value is \( R \).

But in our case, the expression is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). So it's equivalent to \( a\cos\theta + (-432)\sin\theta \), so \( a = 324 \), \( b = -432 \).

So, \( R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324 squared:

324 * 324: Let me compute step by step.

300^2 = 90000, 24^2=576, and 2*300*24=14400.

So, 324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: 400^2 = 160000, 32^2=1024, 2*400*32=25600.

So, 432^2 = (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160000 + 25600 + 1024 = 160000 + 25600 is 185,600; plus 1,024 is 186,624.

So R^2 is 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

Therefore, R = sqrt(291,600). Let me compute that.

I know that 500^2 is 250,000, 540^2 is 291,600 because 54*54=2916, so 540^2 is 291,600.

Yes, because 54^2 = 2916, so 540^2 = 291600.

So R = 540.

Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(\theta) \) is 540.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the expression is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \), which is \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) with b being negative. But when we compute R, it
