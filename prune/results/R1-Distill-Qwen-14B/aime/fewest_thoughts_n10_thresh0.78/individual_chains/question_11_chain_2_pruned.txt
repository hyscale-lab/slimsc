Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, alright. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that for complex numbers, especially when dealing with expressions involving z and 1/z, it might be useful to represent z in polar form. Since |z| = 4, I can write z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That makes sense because the magnitude is fixed, and θ can vary to give different complex numbers on the circle of radius 4.

So, let me write z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, right? Because 1/z = \overline{z}/|z|², and since |z| is 4, it's 1/16 times the conjugate, but in exponential form, that's just e^{-iθ}/16? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If z = re^{iθ}, then 1/z = (1/r) e^{-iθ}. So since r is 4, 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. Yeah, that's correct.

So, substituting z and 1/z into the expression, we get:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each term separately. Let's compute the first term first: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}.

Wait, 75 + 117i is a complex number. Maybe it's better to factor that in. Let me compute 4*(75 + 117i) first. 4*75 is 300, and 4*117 is 468. So, the first term becomes 300 + 468i multiplied by e^{iθ}.

Similarly, for the second term: (96 + 144i)/4 is 24 + 36i. So the second term is (24 + 36i) multiplied by e^{-iθ}.

So, the entire expression becomes:

(300 + 468i) e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

Hmm. Now, I need to find the real part of this expression. So, I should compute the real parts of each term and add them together.

Let me recall that for a complex number a + bi, Re[(a + bi)e^{iθ}] = a cosθ - b sinθ, because e^{iθ} is cosθ + i sinθ, so when you multiply by a + bi, you get (a cosθ - b sinθ) + i(a sinθ + b cosθ). So the real part is a cosθ - b sinθ.

Similarly, for the term (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}, since e^{-iθ} is cosθ - i sinθ, multiplying by (24 + 36i) gives 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ + i(-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ). So the real part is 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Putting it all together, the real part of the entire expression is:

[300 cosθ - 468 sinθ] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ].

Combine like terms:

(300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ.

Which simplifies to:

324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression as θ varies from 0 to 2π.

Wait, right. So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, I remember that expressions of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be rewritten as C cos(θ + φ), where C is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is C, and the minimum is -C.

So, in this case, I have 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Let me write this as A cosθ + B sinθ, but with B negative.

Wait, actually, let me compute the amplitude. The amplitude C is sqrt(A^2 + B^2), where A is 324 and B is -432.

Wait, but in the standard form, it's A cosθ + B sinθ. So here, A is 324 and B is -432. So, the amplitude is sqrt(324^2 + 432^2).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324 squared. 324 is 18^2, which is 324. So, 324^2 = (18^2)^2 = 18^4. Wait, maybe compute it directly: 324 * 324.

Let me compute 300^2 = 90,000. 24^2 = 576. Then, 2*300*24 = 14,400. So, (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976. So, 324^2 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2. 400^2 = 160,000, 32^2 = 1,024. 2*400*32 = 25,600. So, (400 + 32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624. So, 432^2 is 186,624.

So, C = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624).

Adding those: 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

So, C = sqrt(291,600). Hmm, 540^2 is 291,600 because 54^2 is 2,916, so 540^2 is 291,600.

So, the maximum value is 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check.

We had Re[(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z] where |z|=4.

Expressed z as 4e^{iθ}, so 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Then, (75 + 117i)*4 = 300 + 468i, so the first term is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

The second term: (96 + 144i)/4 = 24 + 36i, so (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Then, real part of each term:

First term: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Second term: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Adding them together: 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Then, amplitude: sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600) = 540.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can also think about using vectors or phasors. The expression 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ can be seen as the dot product of two vectors: [324, -432] dotted with [cosθ, sinθ]. The maximum of this dot product is the magnitude of the vector [324, -432], which is indeed 540.

So, yeah, the maximum real part is 540. I think that's the answer.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, \(1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

Substituting \(z\) and \(1/z\) into the expression, we get:
\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i) \cdot \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}.
\]
Simplifying each term:
- The first term becomes \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \).
- The second term becomes \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

The real part of each term is:
- For \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \): \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \).
- For \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \): \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \).

Adding these together:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]
This expression can be rewritten as \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) with \( A = 324 \) and \( B = -432 \). The maximum value of such an expression is the amplitude \( \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \):
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104,976 + 186,624} = \sqrt{291,600} = 540.
\]
Thus, the largest possible real part of the given expression is \(\boxed{540}\).
