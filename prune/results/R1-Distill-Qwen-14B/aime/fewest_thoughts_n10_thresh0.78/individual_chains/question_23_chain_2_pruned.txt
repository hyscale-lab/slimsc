Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that's less than BD² for all such rhombi ABCD on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. The points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, and the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, I remember that a rhombus has its diagonals bisecting each other at right angles, right? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. Let me confirm: Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So that's an important property.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and the diagonals are AC and BD, then the midpoint of AC and BD is the origin.

So, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y), because the midpoint is (0, 0). Similarly, if point B is (p
