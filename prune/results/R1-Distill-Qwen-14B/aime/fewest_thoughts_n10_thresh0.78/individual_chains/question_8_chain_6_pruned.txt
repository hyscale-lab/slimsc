Okay, so I've got this problem here that asks for the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) satisfying two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's quite a mouthful. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I know that a, b, c are nonnegative integers, which means they can be 0 or any positive integer, but they can't be negative. The first equation is straightforward: the sum of the three variables is 300. The second equation is a bit more complex, involving each pair of variables multiplied together in a specific way. Let's write it down again:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me look for common factors. I notice that for each term, we have a square of one variable multiplied by another. Let's see:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, putting it all together, the entire expression can be rewritten as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

That's a bit cleaner. Now, since we know that a + b + c = 300, perhaps I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), because if a + b + c = 300, then b + c = 300 - a. Similarly, a + c = 300 - b and a + b = 300 - c.

So, substituting these into the expression, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c).

Let me write that down:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that seems more manageable. Maybe I can expand each term:

For the first term: a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³
Similarly, the second term: b²(300 - b) = 300b² - b³
And the third term: c²(300 - c) = 300c² - c³.

Adding them all together:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Let me factor out the 300 from the quadratic terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So, the equation simplifies to:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can write this as:

300(a² + b² + c²) = 6,000,000 + (a³ + b³ + c³).

Divide both sides by 300:

a² + b² + c² = 20,000 + (a³ + b³ + c³)/300.

Wait, that might not be the most straightforward approach. Let me think differently. Since a + b + c is given, perhaps I can express a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of symmetric sums.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). So, we can express a² + b² + c² as (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + ac + bc). Since a + b + c is 300, then a² + b² + c² = 300² - 2(ab + ac + bc) = 90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc).

Similarly, I wonder if there's a formula for a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of symmetric sums. Yes, I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. So, substituting that in:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

Let me compute 300³. 300*300 is 90,000, and 90,000*300 is 27,000,000. So, 300³ is 27,000,000.

So putting it all together:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

Now, going back to our equation, which is:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Substituting a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ with the expressions we derived:

300*(90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc)) - [27,000,000 - 900(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let me expand this step by step.

First, compute 300*(90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc)):

300*90,000 = 27,000,000

300*(-2(ab + ac + bc)) = -600(ab + ac + bc)

So, that term becomes 27,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc).

Now, subtract the next part: [27,000,000 - 900(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc].

So, subtracting each component:

27,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc) - 27,000,000 + 900(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc.

Let me combine like terms.

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.

-600(ab + ac + bc) + 900(ab + ac + bc) = 300(ab + ac + bc).

Then, we have -3abc.

So, putting it all together:

300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

So, the equation simplifies to:

300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Let me factor out a 3:

3[100(ab + ac + bc) - abc] = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, that's a more manageable equation:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me write that as:

abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me rearrange:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

Alternatively, I can write it as:

abc = 100(ab + ac + bc) - 2,000,000.

Not sure if that helps yet. Alternatively, maybe factor out something else.

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor out ab, ac, bc. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe factor in terms of (a - 100), (b - 100), or something like that. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = ab + ac + bc, and Q = abc. Then, from the equation above, we have:

100P - Q = 2,000,000.

So, Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

Also, we know that for three variables, the relationship between S, P, Q is also given by the cubic equation:

x³ - Sx² + Px - Q = 0.

So, since a, b, c are roots of this equation, we can write:

x³ - 300x² + Px - Q = 0.

But since we have Q = 100P - 2,000,000, we can substitute that into the equation:

x³ - 300x² + Px - (100P - 2,000,000) = 0.

Simplify:

x³ - 300x² + Px - 100P + 2,000,000 = 0.

Factor P terms:

x³ - 300x² + P(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe we can rearrange terms:

x³ - 300x² + 2,000,000 = -P(x - 100).

But since P = ab + ac + bc, and a, b, c are nonnegative integers, P must be a nonnegative integer as well.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as:

x³ - 300x² + 2,000,000 = -P(x - 100).

But I don't see an immediate way to factor this. Maybe let's consider that a, b, c are integers and perhaps think about possible values for a, b, c.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider that the equation 100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000 can be rewritten as:

abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, perhaps factor this expression. Let me
