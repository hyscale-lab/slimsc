Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. They're all positive real numbers, which is good because logarithms of non-positive numbers aren't defined. The problem gives me three equations involving logarithms base 2, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), then express that as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and finally find m + n.

Let me write down the equations:

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

I need to solve for x, y, z and then compute |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

Hmm, maybe I can rewrite these logarithmic equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

So, rewriting each equation:

1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)
2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)
3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)

Let me denote these as equations (1), (2), and (3) respectively.

So, equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z
Equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z
Equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y

This looks like a system of equations where each variable is expressed in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute them into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me try to express all variables in terms of one variable, say x, then solve for x first.

From equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z. Let me solve for y in terms of x and z.

Wait, maybe it's better to express y and z in terms of x.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z. So, if I can express z in terms of x, I can substitute into equation (3).

From equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y. But from equation (2), y is 2^(1/3) x z. So substitute that into equation (3):

z = 2^(1/4) * x * [2^(1/3) x z] = 2^(1/4 + 1/3) * x^2 z

Simplify the exponents: 1/4 + 1/3 is... let me compute that.

1/4 is 3/12, 1/3 is 4/12, so together it's 7/12. So,

z = 2^(7/12) x^2 z

Hmm, so z = 2^(7/12) x^2 z. Let's subtract 2^(7/12) x^2 z from both sides:

z - 2^(7/12) x^2 z = 0

Factor out z:

z (1 - 2^(7/12) x^2) = 0

But z is a positive real number, so z ≠ 0. Therefore:

1 - 2^(7/12) x^2 = 0

Which implies:

2^(7/12) x^2 = 1

So, x^2 = 2^(-7/12)

Taking square roots, since x is positive:

x = 2^(-7/24)

Wait, because sqrt(2^(-7/12)) = 2^(-7/24). Right.

Now that I have x, I can find y and z.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z

But I need z in terms of x. Let's use equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y

But since y is expressed in terms of x and z, this might get circular. Maybe substitute x into equation (1) or (2).

Wait, perhaps it's better to express y and z in terms of x, and then plug back into one of the equations.

But let me see: I have x = 2^(-7/24). Let me compute 2^(-7/24) as (2^(1/24))^(-7) or something, but maybe it's better to keep it as is for now.

Let me go back to equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) y z

We have x = 2^(-7/24), so:

2^(-7/24) = 2^(1/2) y z

Divide both sides by 2^(1/2):

y z = 2^(-7/24 - 1/2) = 2^(-7/24 - 12/24) = 2^(-19/24)

So, equation (1a): y z = 2^(-19/24)

Similarly, from equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) x z

We can plug x = 2^(-7/24) into this:

y = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-7/24) * z = 2^(1/3 - 7/24) * z

Compute the exponent: 1/3 is 8/24, so 8/24 -7/24 = 1/24. So,

y = 2^(1/24) * z

So, equation (2a): y = 2^(1/24) z

Now, substitute equation (2a) into equation (1a): y z = 2^(-19/24)

So, (2^(1/24) z) * z = 2^(-19/24)

Which is 2^(1/24) z^2 = 2^(-19/24)

Divide both sides by 2^(1/24):

z^2 = 2^(-19/24 - 1/24) = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6)

So, z^2 = 2^(-5/6)

Taking square roots, z = 2^(-5/12) since z is positive.

So, z = 2^(-5/12)

Now, from equation (2a): y = 2^(1/24) z

Plug in z = 2^(-5/12):

y = 2^(1/24) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/24 - 5/12)

Convert 5/12 to 10/24:

So, 1/24 - 10/24 = -9/24 = -3/8.

Thus, y = 2^(-3/8)

So, summarizing:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8)

z = 2^(-5/12)

Wait, let me double-check these exponents.

Starting with x: 2^(-7/24). That's correct.

y: 2^(-3/8). 3/8 is 9/24, so 1/24 - 10/24 is -9/24 which is -3/8. Correct.

z: 2^(-5/12). 5/12 is 10/24, so when we had z^2 = 2^(-5/6) which is 2^(-20/24), so z is 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-5/12). Correct.

Now, I need to compute log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2). Let's compute the exponents:

x^4 = [2^(-7/24)]^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)

y^3 = [2^(-3/8)]^3 = 2^(-9/8)

z^2 = [2^(-5/12)]^2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)

Multiplying all together:

x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)

Let me add the exponents:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6

First, let's find a common denominator for 6 and 8, which is 24.

Convert each fraction:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Adding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

So, x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-75/24) = 2^(-25/8)

Wait, because 75/24 simplifies to 25
