Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron problem. Let me try to visualize it first. The tetrahedron is labeled ABCD. The edges have specific lengths: AB and CD are √41, AC and BD are √80, and BC and AD are √89. Interesting, so the edges are paired up with equal lengths. That might mean the tetrahedron is symmetric in some way.

The problem mentions a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are equal. I remember this point is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. In a triangle, the incenter is the point where the angle bisectors meet, and it's equidistant from all sides. For a tetrahedron, the incenter is equidistant from all four faces, and that distance is called the inradius. So, I need to find this inradius.

The distance is given in the form m√n / p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, I need to find m + n + p.

First, to find the inradius, I think I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the sum of the areas of its faces. Because in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume and S is the total surface area.

So, I need to compute V and S.

But wait, how do I compute the volume of a tetrahedron given the edge lengths? It's not regular because the edges are not all equal. Maybe it's a type of isosceles tetrahedron, which I think has opposite edges equal. In this case, AB=CD, AC=BD, and AD=BC, so it is an isosceles tetrahedron. That might mean it's a kind of "equifacial" tetrahedron, where all faces are congruent, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, equifacial usually means that all faces are congruent triangles, but in this case, the edges are such that each pair of opposite edges are equal, which is a characteristic of an isosceles tetrahedron.

I remember that in an isosceles tetrahedron, the volume can be calculated using a formula similar to Heron's formula but extended to 3D. Maybe I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume^2 = (1/288) * determinant of the matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²   b²   c² |
| 1  a²   0    d²   e² |
| 1  b²  d²    0    f² |
| 1  c²  e²   f²    0  |

So, first, let me assign the given lengths to the variables a, b, c, d, e, f.

Given:

AB = √41 => a² = 41

AC = √80 => b² = 80

AD = √89 => c² = 89

BC = √89 => d² = 89

BD = √80 => e² = 80

CD = √41 => f² = 41

So, the determinant matrix becomes:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Hmm, that's a 5x5 determinant. Calculating that seems a bit involved, but maybe there's some symmetry here that can simplify things.

Let me write out the matrix explicitly:

0   1    1    1    1

1   0   41   80   89

1  41    0   89   80

1  80   89    0   41

1  89   80   41    0

I notice that the matrix is symmetric across the main diagonal. That might help in computing the determinant, perhaps by some properties or simplification.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to compute this determinant step by step.

But maybe that's too time-consuming. I remember that for an isosceles tetrahedron, there's a formula for the volume in terms of its edges. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the volume another way.

Wait, another approach: if I can find the coordinates of the vertices, I can compute the volume using the scalar triple product.

So, maybe assigning coordinates to the tetrahedron could be a way. Let's try that.

Let me place vertex A at the origin, (0, 0, 0). Let me assign coordinates to B, C, D such that the given edge lengths are satisfied.

Let me let AB = √41, so point B can be at (x, 0, 0), and I can choose such that the distance AB is √41. Let's let B be at (a, 0, 0). Then, AB = a = √41, so a² = 41.

Similarly, let's place point C somewhere in the xy-plane, so C = (p, q, 0). Then, AC = √80, so the distance from A(0,0,0) to C(p, q, 0) is √(p² + q²) = √80 => p² + q² = 80.

Similarly, BC is given as √89. So, distance from B(a, 0, 0) to C(p, q, 0) is √[(p - a)^2 + q²] = √89.

So, (p - a)^2 + q² = 89.

We have two equations:

1. p² + q² = 80

2. (p - a)^2 + q² = 89

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:

(p - a)^2 + q² - (p² + q²) = 89 - 80

Expanding (p - a)^2: p² -
