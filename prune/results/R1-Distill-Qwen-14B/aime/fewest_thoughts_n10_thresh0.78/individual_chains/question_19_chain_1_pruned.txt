Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. Let me try to parse it out step by step. 

The problem says that triangle ABC has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product of AB and AC, which is AB · AC.

Hmm, okay. Let me recall some concepts. The circumradius (R) is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumcenter O is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, and the incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, that seems important. Maybe I can use some properties involving perpendicular lines or some right triangles here.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter (I) and circumcenter (O) can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me verify that formula. Yeah, I think that's correct. So plugging in the given values, R is 13 and r is 6.

Calculating OI²:
OI² = 13(13 - 2*6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13
So OI = sqrt(13). That's the distance between O and I.

But wait, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So triangle OIA is a right triangle with right angle at I. So in triangle OIA, the sides are OI, IA, and OA. Since it's a right triangle, I can apply the Pythagorean theorem.

Let me denote OA as the circumradius, which is 13. So OA = 13. OI we found to be sqrt(13), and IA is the inradius? Wait, no. IA is the distance from incenter I to vertex A. The inradius is the distance from I to any side, not to the vertex. So IA isn't necessarily equal to r.

Wait, but in a triangle, the length from the inradius to the vertex can be calculated. Maybe I need a formula for that. Alternatively, since triangle OIA is right-angled at I, by Pythagoras:

(OI)² + (IA)² = (OA)²

We know OI² is 13, OA is 13, so plugging in:

13 + (IA)² = 13²
13 + (IA)² = 169
So (IA)² = 169 - 13 = 156
Thus, IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39)

Hmm, that's the length of IA. But how does that help me find AB · AC?

I need to think about AB · AC. That's the product of the lengths of two sides of the triangle. Maybe I can relate this to other properties of the triangle.
