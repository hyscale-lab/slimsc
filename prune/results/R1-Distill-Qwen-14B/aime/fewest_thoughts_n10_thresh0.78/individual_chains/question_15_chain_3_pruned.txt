Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which I think means they go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, moving only right or up. The catch is that these paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down.

First, I remember that in a grid, the number of paths from one corner to the opposite without any restrictions is given by combinations. Since it's an 8x8 grid, you have to make 8 right moves and 8 up moves. The total number of steps is 16, so the number of paths is C(16,8), which is 12870. But that's without any restrictions on direction changes.

Now, the problem is specifically asking about paths that change direction exactly four times. So, what does it mean to change direction? Well, each time the path goes from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. The starting direction could be either right or up, but in an 8x8 grid, I think the starting direction is typically considered as right, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, actually, the path can start with either direction, right? Because if you start by moving up, that's also a valid path. So, the initial direction is part of the path.

But when the problem says "change direction exactly four times," does that include the initial direction? Or does it count each switch after the first step? Let me clarify that. For example, if the path starts by moving right, then every time it switches to up, that's a direction change. Similarly, switching back would be another change. So, each switch between right and up counts as a change.

Wait, how many direction changes are possible in a path? Let's think about the minimal and maximum number of direction changes. The minimal number is 1, if the path goes all the way right then all the way up, or vice versa. The maximum number of direction changes would be 15, alternating directions each step. But in this problem, we're interested in exactly four direction changes.

So, how do we model this? I remember that in combinatorics, the number of paths with exactly k direction changes can be calculated using some
