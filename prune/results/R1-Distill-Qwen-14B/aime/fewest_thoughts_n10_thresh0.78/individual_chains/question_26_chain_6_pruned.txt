Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the parts.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

Hmm. Alright, let me try to visualize this. There's triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. So, it's not a right-angled triangle, since 5² + 9² is 25 + 81 = 106, which isn't equal to 10² = 100. So, it's an obtuse triangle, maybe? Let me check: 5^2 + 10^2 = 25 + 100 = 125, which is bigger than 9^2 = 81, so angle B is acute? Wait, maybe I should calculate the angles using the Law of Cosines.

Wait, maybe that's getting ahead of myself. Let me see what tools I can use here.

Firstly, the tangents from point D to the circle ω at B and C. So, point D is the ex-pole or something? Wait, no, the point where two tangents intersect is called the ex-similicenter or something like that. Wait, actually, for a circle, the point where two tangents meet is called the external homothety center if we consider homothety that sends one tangent to another. But maybe that's overcomplicating.

Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, then DB and DC are both tangents from D to ω. So, DB = DC. That's a property of tangents from a common external point to a circle—they're equal in length.

So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC. Hmm, that might be useful later.

Now, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at P. So, starting from A, going through D, and hitting the circle again at P. We need to find the length of AP.

I remember that when a line intersects a circle, the power of a point can come into play. Power of a point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DP * DA. Wait, is that right? Let me recall. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB², since DB is a tangent. Similarly, since D lies outside the circle, and AD is a secant line intersecting the circle at A and P, the power of D is equal to DP * DA. So, yes, DB² = DP * DA.

So, Power of D gives us DB
