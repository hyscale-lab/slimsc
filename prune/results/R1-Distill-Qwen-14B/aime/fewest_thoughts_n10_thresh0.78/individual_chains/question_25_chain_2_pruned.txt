Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me see if I can figure this out. Hmm, the problem is about sets and how they overlap. I remember something about inclusion-exclusion principles from math class. Let me try to recall how that works.

First, let's list out the numbers given. There are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns at least a bag of candy hearts. So, that's one common thing everyone has. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 respectively. 

Wait, the problem also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. But not all four. I need to find out how many own all four. Since everyone owns the candy hearts, that's the fourth item. So, it's like four sets: candy hearts, diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades.

Let me denote the sets as follows:
- C: candy hearts (which is everyone, so |C| = 900)
- D: diamond rings, |D|=195
- G: golf clubs, |G|=367
- S: garden spades, |S|=562

I need to find |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|. But since C is everything, that's the same as |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

I remember the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, since everyone has C, maybe I can model this as three sets within the universal set C. Let me think.

The total number of residents is 900, so the union of D, G, and S plus those who only have C is 900. Wait, no, no. Because everyone has C, so the total is just the union of D, G, S, and C. But since C is universal, the union is just C, which is 900. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at the numbers of exactly two and exactly three. Let me think about how inclusion-exclusion applies here.

In inclusion-exclusion for three sets, the formula for the union is |D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

But wait, since everyone has C, then the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S is equal to |D ∪ G ∪ S|. Because if someone doesn't own D, G, or S, they still have C, but they must have exactly C.

But wait, no. The problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, in addition to that, they might own other things. So, the total number of people is 900, which includes all those owning various combinations of the four items. But the union of D, G, S, and C is 900, but since C is already universal, the union is 900.

But perhaps I should focus on the exact numbers given: 437 own exactly two things, and 234 own exactly three. So, these numbers are the counts for exactly two and exactly three of the four items.

Wait, no, the problem states: "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, all 900 have C. Then, the other three items (D, G, S) are owned by some number of people. So, when they talk about exactly two, they mean exactly two of D, G, S, and C. Similarly
