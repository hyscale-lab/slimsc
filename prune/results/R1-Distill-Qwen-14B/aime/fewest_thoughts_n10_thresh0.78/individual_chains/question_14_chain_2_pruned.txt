Okay, so I have this math problem here that I need to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem is:

"Let \( N \) be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Let \( Q \) and \( R \) be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when \( N \) is divided by 1000. Find \( Q + R \)."

Alright, so I need to find the largest four-digit number \( N \) such that if any single digit of \( N \) is replaced by 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Then, once I find \( N \), I have to divide it by 1000 and find the sum of the quotient \( Q \) and the remainder \( R \).

First, let's break down the problem. \( N \) is a four-digit number, so it ranges from 1000 to 9999. We need the largest such \( N \), so ideally, I want the thousands digit to be as large as possible, then the hundreds, tens, and units digits.

The key property here is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So, regardless of which digit we change (thousands, hundreds, tens, or units), replacing it with 1 should result in a number that's a multiple of 7.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me think about what this implies. For each digit in \( N \), replacing it with 1 must result in a number divisible by 7. So, for each position, the difference between the original number and the modified number (with 1 replacing the digit) must be a multiple of 7.

Wait, perhaps I can model this. Let me denote \( N \) as a four-digit number with digits \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), \( d \), where \( a \) is the thousands digit, \( b \) the hundreds, \( c \) the tens, and \( d \) the units. So, \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \).

Now, if I change the thousands digit to 1, the new number is \( 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d \). Similarly, changing the hundreds digit to 1 gives \( 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d \), and so on for the tens and units digits.

Each of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7. So, subtracting the original number \( N \) from each modified number should give me a multiple of 7. Let me see:

1. Changing thousands digit:
   Modified number: \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \)
   Difference: \( (1000 + 100b + 10c + d) - (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) = 1000(1 - a) \)
   So, \( 1000(1 - a) \) must be divisible by 7.

2. Changing hundreds digit:
   Modified number: \( 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \)
   Difference: \( (1000a + 100 + 10c + d) - (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) = 100(1 - b) \)
   So, \( 100(1 - b) \) must be divisible by 7.

3. Changing tens digit:
   Modified number: \( 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \)
   Difference: \( (1000a + 100b + 10 + d) - (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) = 10(1 - c) \)
   So, \( 10(1 - c) \) must be divisible by 7.

4. Changing units digit:
   Modified number: \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \)
   Difference: \( (1000a + 100b + 10c + 1) - (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) = (1 - d) \)
   So, \( 1 - d \) must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these differences must be divisible by 7. Let me write down each condition:

1. \( 1000(1 - a) \) is divisible by 7 → \( 1000(1 - a) \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
2. \( 100(1 - b) \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
3. \( 10(1 - c) \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
4. \( (1 - d) \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)

Now, let's compute each of these modulo 7. First, it's helpful to find what 1000, 100, 10, and 1 are modulo 7.

Compute each coefficient modulo 7:

- 1000 mod 7: Let's compute 7*142=994, so 1000-994=6 → 1000 ≡ 6 mod7
- 100 mod7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2 → 100 ≡ 2 mod7
- 10 mod7: 7*1=7, 10-7=3 → 10 ≡3 mod7
- 1 mod7 is 1.

So,

1. 1000 ≡6 mod7 → 6*(1 - a) ≡0 mod7 → 6(1 - a) ≡0 mod7
2. 100 ≡2 mod7 → 2*(1 - b) ≡0 mod7
3. 10 ≡3 mod7 →3*(1 - c) ≡0 mod7
4. 1*(1 - d) ≡0 mod7 → (1 - d) ≡0 mod7

Let me solve each of these congruences:

1. 6(1 - a) ≡0 mod7. Since 6 and 7 are coprime, this implies (1 - a) ≡0 mod7 → a ≡1 mod7. But since a is a digit (1-9, as it's the thousands digit), a must be 1 or 8 (since 1+7=8). But we're looking for the greatest four-digit number, so we want a as large as possible. So a=8.

2. 2(1 - b) ≡0 mod7. Similarly, 2 and 7 are coprime, so (1 - b) ≡0 mod7 → b ≡1 mod7. Since b is a digit (0-9), b can be 1 or 8. We want the largest possible number, so b=8.

3. 3(1 - c) ≡0 mod7. Again, 3 and 7 are coprime, so (1 - c) ≡0 mod7 → c ≡1 mod7. So c can be 1 or 8, as 1+7=8. To maximize N, c=8.

4. (1 - d) ≡0 mod7 → d ≡1 mod7. So d can be 1 or 8. To maximize N, d=8.

Wait, so according to this, each digit a, b, c, d should be either 1 or 8, but to maximize N, each should be as large as possible. So all digits would be 8. So N would be 8888.

But wait, is 8888 the correct number? Let me test this. If I change any digit to 1, does the resulting number become divisible by 7?

Let me try each case:

1. Changing thousands digit: 1888. Is 1888 divisible by 7? Let's check 7*269=1883. 1888-1883=5. So 1888 mod7=5. Not divisible by7. Hmm, that's a problem.

So 8888 doesn't satisfy the condition because changing the thousands digit to 1 gives 1888, which is not divisible by7.

So my initial approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reasoning. Let me re-examine the conditions.

I thought that for each digit, the difference (modified - original) must be divisible by7. So, for the thousands digit:

Modified number: 1000*1 +100b +10c +d = 1000 + 100b +10c +d
Original number: 1000a +100b +10c +d
Difference: 1000(1 - a) must be divisible by7 → 6(1 -a) ≡0 mod7 → a ≡1 mod7.

But a is a digit from 1-9, so a=1 or 8. But we saw that a=8 didn't work in the test.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is that when changing a digit, the difference (modified - original) is equal to - (original
