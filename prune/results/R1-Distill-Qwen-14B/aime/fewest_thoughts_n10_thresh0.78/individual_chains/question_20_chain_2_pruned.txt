Okay, so I've got this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but I don't have to use all of them. The goal is to find the number of ways to place some chips on the grid following certain conditions.

Let me try to break down the problem. The conditions are:

1. Each cell can have at most one chip.
2. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
3. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
4. Any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous conditions.

Hmm, so the first condition is straightforwardâ€”no overfilling cells. The second and third conditions are about color uniformity in rows and columns. That makes me think that each row and each column must either be all white, all black, or have no chips at all. Because if a row has any chips, they must all be the same color. Same with columns.

Wait, but if a column has any chips, they must all be the same color, even if different rows have different colors. So, for example, if one column has all white chips, and another column has all black chips, that's fine. But within each column, all chips must be same color.

But there's another catch: any additional chip would violate the conditions. So that means the arrangement must be such that every empty cell is in a row and column that already has all cells filled with a single color, or else adding a chip to that cell would cause a conflict.

Wait, no, that might not be the case. Let me think again. The last condition says that any additional chip would violate the previous conditions. So the arrangement is maximal in the sense that adding any chip would either cause a row to have mixed colors or a column to have mixed colors.

So, in other words, the current arrangement is such that for every empty cell, if I tried to add a chip there, it would either make the row have both colors or the column have both colors. Therefore, in order for that to be the case, every empty cell must be in a row that is either already monochromatic or could become non-monochromatic if another chip is added. Similarly for the columns.

Wait, no. Let me think differently. For the arrangement to be maximal, every empty cell must be in a row and a column that are both either completely filled or cannot have another chip without violating the color condition.

Wait
