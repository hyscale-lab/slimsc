Alright, so I've got this logarithm problem here, and I need to find the product xy where both x and y are greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, okay, let's try to unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite these logarithmic equations into their exponential forms. That might make it easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the logarithm property, I know that log_b(a^k) = k * log_b(a). So applying that here, this would be x * log_x(y) = 10. Wait, but log_x(y) is the exponent to which I have to raise x to get y. Let me call that exponent something, say, let's set a = log_x(y). Then, x^a = y.

So, substituting back into the first equation: x * a = 10. That gives me equation (1): x * a = 10.

But since a is log_x(y), and we know that log_x(y) = (ln y)/(ln x) from the change of base formula. Hmm, maybe I can express y in terms of x or vice versa. Alternatively, since I have two variables, maybe I can find another equation from the second logarithm.

Looking at the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, using the logarithm power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Let me denote log_y(x) as b. Then, similar to before, y^b = x.

So, substituting back, we have 4y * b = 10. That's equation (2): 4y * b = 10.

But wait a minute, I have a and b here. Let me see if I can relate them. Since a = log_x(y) and b = log_y(x), I remember that log_b(a) = 1/(log_a(b)). So, in this case, b = log_y(x) = 1/(log_x(y)) = 1/a. So, b = 1/a.

That's a useful relationship. So, if I substitute b = 1/a into equation (2), I get:

4y * (1/a) = 10. So, 4y/a = 10. Let's write that as equation (2a): 4y = 10a.

Now, from equation (1), x * a = 10. Let me solve for x: x = 10/a. So equation (1a): x = 10/a.

But we also have that y = x^a from earlier, since y = x^a. So, equation (3): y = x^a.

Substituting equation (1a) into equation (3):

y = (10/a)^a.

Hmm, okay, now we have y in terms of a. Let me write that down: y = (10/a)^a.

Now, let's plug this expression for y into equation (2a): 4y = 10a.

Substituting y, we get:

4 * (10/a)^a = 10a.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it.

Let's divide both sides by 2 to make it easier:

2 * (10/a)^a = 5a.

Wait, maybe not the best approach. Alternatively, let's write this as:

4 * (10/a)^a = 10a.

Dividing both sides by 10:

(4/10) * (10/a)^a = a.

Simplify 4/10 as 2/5:

(2/5) * (10/a)^a = a.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let me think if there's another way. Maybe taking logarithms on both sides could help me solve for a.

But before that, perhaps I can express (10/a)^a in terms of exponents. Let me denote (10/a)^a = e^{a ln(10/a)}. So, that's e^{a [ln 10 - ln a]}.

So, substituting that back into the equation:

4 * e^{a (ln 10 - ln a)} = 10a.

Hmm, this might not be the most straightforward path, but perhaps I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to linearize the equation.

Taking ln on both sides:

ln(4 * e^{a (ln 10 - ln a)}) = ln(10a).

Using the logarithm product rule, this becomes:

ln(4) + ln(e^{a (ln 10 - ln a)}) = ln(10) + ln(a).

Simplify the left side: ln(4) + a (ln 10 - ln a).

So,

ln(4) + a (ln 10 - ln a) = ln(10) + ln(a).

Let me rearrange this equation:

ln(4) - ln(10) + a (ln 10 - ln a) - ln(a) = 0.

Hmm, ln(4) - ln(10) is a constant, about ln(4/10) = ln(0.4) which is negative, but let's not compute approximate values yet.

Let me see if I can factor anything. Let's write the equation as:

ln(4/10) + a (ln 10 - ln a) - ln(a) = 0.

Hmm, maybe factor ln(a) terms.

So,

ln(2/5) + a ln(10) - a ln(a) - ln(a) = 0.

Combine the ln(a) terms:

ln(2/5) + a ln(10) - (a + 1) ln(a) = 0.

This still looks complicated. Maybe I can make a substitution for a. Let me set t = a. Then the equation becomes:

ln(2/5) + t ln(10) - (t + 1) ln(t) = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can try small integer values for a to see if it satisfies this equation.

Wait, let's think: a is log_x(y), and x and y are both greater than 1. So, log_x(y) can be any positive real number. But perhaps a is an integer? Let me test a = 2.

If a = 2:

Left side: ln(2/5) + 2 ln(10) - (2 +1) ln(2).

Compute each term:

ln(2/5) ≈ ln(0.4) ≈ -0.916.

2 ln(10) ≈ 2 * 2.302 ≈ 4.604.

(3) ln(2) ≈ 3 * 0.693 ≈ 2.079.

So,

-0.916 + 4.604 - 2.079 ≈ (-0.916 -2.079) +4.604 ≈ (-3) +4.604 ≈ 1.604, which is not zero.

Hmm, okay, a=2 is not the solution.

How about a=3:

ln(2/5) +3 ln(10) -4 ln(3).

Compute:

ln(2/5) ≈ -0.916.

3 ln(10) ≈ 6.906.

4 ln(3) ≈ 4 *1.0986≈4.394.

So,

-0.916 +6.906 -4.394 ≈ (-0.916 -4.394) +6.906 ≈ (-5.31) +6.906 ≈1.596. Still not zero.

Hmm, perhaps a=5?

ln(2/5) +5 ln(10) -6 ln(5).

Compute:

ln(2/5)= -0.916.

5 ln(10)≈5*2.302≈11.51.

6 ln(5)≈6*1.609≈9.655.

So,

-0.916 +11.51 -9.655≈ ( -0.916 -9.655 ) +11.51≈ (-10.571) +11.51≈0.939. Closer, but still not zero.

What about a=4?

ln(2/5) +4 ln(10) -5 ln(4).

Compute:

ln(2/5)= -0.916.

4 ln(10)= 4*2.302≈9.208.

5 ln(4)=5*1.386≈6.93.

So,

-0.916 +9.208 -6.93≈ ( -0.916 -6.93 ) +9.208≈ (-7.846) +9.208≈1.362. Not zero.

Hmm, a=1?

a=1:

ln(2/5) +1 ln(10) - (1+1) ln(1) = ln(2/5)+ln(10) - 2*0.

Which is ln(2/5*10) = ln(4) ≈1.386 ≠0.

Not zero.

Wait, maybe I need to try a non-integer value. Alternatively, perhaps the substitution approach.

Wait, from equation (2a): 4y = 10a, so y = (10a)/4 = (5a)/2.

But from equation (3): y = x^a, and from equation (1a): x=10/a.

So, y = (10/a)^a.

But we also have y = (5a)/2.

So, set them equal:

(10/a)^a = (5a)/2.

Hmm, so (10/a)^a = (5a)/2.

This seems tricky. Maybe let me write 10 as 2*5.

So, ( (2*5)/a )^a = (5a)/2.

Which is (2*5/a)^a = (5a)/2.

Hmm, perhaps take logarithms here.

Taking ln on both sides:

a * ln(2*5/a) = ln(5a/2).

Let me write that:

a [ln(10) - ln(a)] = ln(5a) - ln(2).

Which is:

a ln(10) - a ln(a) = ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2).

Let me rearrange:

a ln(10) - a ln(a) - ln(a) + ln(2) - ln(5) = 0.

Factor terms with ln(a):

a ln(10) - (a +1) ln(a) + ln(2/5) =0.

Wait, that's the same equation I had earlier. So, no progress there.

Hmm, perhaps try to let t = a, and write equation as:

t ln(10) - (t +1) ln(t) + ln(2/5) = 0.

This is a transcendental equation and might not have a solution in terms of elementary functions. Maybe it's better to solve numerically.

Wait, but perhaps a is 5?

Wait, earlier when a=5, the left side was approximately 0.939, which was close to zero. Let me check a=5 more accurately.

Compute each term:

ln(2/5) ≈ ln(0.4) ≈ -0.9162
