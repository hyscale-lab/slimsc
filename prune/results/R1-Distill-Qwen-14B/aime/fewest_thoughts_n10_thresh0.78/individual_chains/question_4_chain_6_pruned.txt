Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's break this down. It sounds like a classic game theory problem, probably involving something called the "winning positions" and "losing positions." A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does, and a losing position is the opposite—the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

Since Alice goes first, if the starting position is a losing position, then Bob can win. So I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position for the first player (Alice), meaning Bob can always win.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote a position as a losing position if the current player cannot force a win. So for a position n, if all possible moves lead to a winning position for the opponent, then n is a losing position.

Let's start by analyzing small values of n to find a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for Bob. Bob can then take 1 and win. Wait, but wait—if Alice takes 1, then Bob can take 1 and win. Alternatively, Alice could take 4 tokens, but she can't, since n=2 <4. So Alice only can take 1, leading to Bob taking the last one. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win if n=2. Wait, wait, no—if n=2, Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1 and wins. So Alice can't force a win, so n=2 is a losing position for Alice. So Bob can win when n=2.

Wait, that's conflicting with my initial thought. Let me clarify.

Wait, in the game, the person who takes the last token wins. So if n=2, Alice takes 1, leaving n=1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice because no matter what she does, Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position. So Bob can win when n=2.

n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving n=2, which is a losing position for Bob. So Bob is in a losing position, meaning Alice can force a win. So n=3 is a winning position for Alice.

n=4: Alice can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So n=4 is a winning position.

n=5: Alice can take 1, leaving n=4, which is a winning position for Bob. Alternatively, she can take 4, leaving n=1, which is a winning position for Bob. Wait, but taking 1 would leave Bob with n=4, which is a winning position. So Bob can win from n=4. So if Alice takes 1, leaving 4, Bob can take 4 and win. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4, leaving
