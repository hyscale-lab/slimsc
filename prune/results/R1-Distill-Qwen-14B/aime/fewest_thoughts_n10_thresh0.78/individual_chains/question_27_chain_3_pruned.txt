Okay, so I have this problem here about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't pass through its center. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. So, the torus has two important measurements: the major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution) which is 6, and the minor radius, which is 3.

Now, there's a sphere involved with radius 11. The problem says that when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. Conversely, when it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, I should probably figure out the equations for the sphere and the torus. Then, find where they are tangent in both cases and determine the radii of those tangent circles.

Starting with the sphere. The sphere has a radius of 11, so its equation in 3D would be x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121. But since we're dealing with a torus, which is a surface of revolution, maybe I can model this in 2D first, using cross-sections.

Wait, the torus is a surface in 3D, but its cross-section is a circle. When it's placed inside the sphere, the torus will be tangent at some circle. Similarly, when placed outside, the sphere will be tangent to the torus externally.

Let me think about how the torus is positioned. The torus is formed by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of that circle. So, the major radius R is 6, and the minor radius r is 3.

I remember the equation of a torus in 3D can be written using the formula for a surface of revolution. In cylindrical coordinates (which are easier for this since the torus is symmetric around the axis), the equation is:

(R - sqrt(x² + y²))² + z² = r²

But wait, let me get that right. In cylindrical coordinates, where x² + y² = ρ², the equation becomes:

(ρ - R)^2 + z² = r²

Wait, no, actually, the standard equation is:

(ρ - R)^2 + z² = r²

But wait, when R is the major radius, so in our case, R is 6. So the equation becomes:

(ρ - 6)^2 + z² = 3² = 9

So, that's the equation of the torus.

Now, when this torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's equation is ρ² + z² = 11² = 121.

Wait, but actually, in 3D, the sphere's equation is x² + y² + z² = 121, which in cylindrical coordinates is ρ² + z² = 121.

So, when the torus is inside the sphere, their surfaces are tangent. At the point of tangency, their normals must be equal, right? So, the gradients of the two surfaces at that point must be the same.

Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, the sphere is inside the torus, and they are tangent.

But wait
