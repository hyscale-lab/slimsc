Okay, so I've got this problem: I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (which is a 12-sided polygon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this.

First, I remember that a regular dodecagon has all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle is 150 degrees. But I'm not sure if that's directly relevant yet. 

The problem is about rectangles. So, rectangles have four sides, with opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. But in the context of a dodecagon, the sides of the rectangle aren't necessarily the edges of the dodecagon itself; they can be diagonals as well. So I need to find all possible rectangles where each side is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon.

Wait, but how can a rectangle be formed inside the dodecagon? I guess it depends on how the sides and diagonals intersect. Maybe the rectangle is determined by four sides/diagonals that form right angles.

But how do sides and diagonals of a regular dodecagon form right angles? I think in a regular polygon, the central angles are multiples of 360/n degrees. For a dodecagon, each central angle between two adjacent vertices is 30 degrees (since 360/12=30). So, if I can find four points such that the lines connecting them form right angles, that would be a rectangle.

Alternatively, maybe the diagonals are spaced in such a way that they create right angles when connected. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the coordinates of the vertices and see how lines between them can form rectangles.

Let me assign coordinates to the dodecagon. Let's assume it's centered at the origin, and one vertex is at (1,0). The vertices can be represented as (cos θ, sin θ), where θ is 0°, 30°, 60°, ..., up to 330°.

So, the vertices are at angles 0°, 30°, 60°, ..., 330°. Now, any side or diagonal of the dodecagon connects two vertices. A rectangle is determined by four such lines, each connecting two vertices, forming four sides at right angles.

Wait, so for a rectangle, the opposite sides must be equal and parallel, and the adjacent sides must be perpendicular. Therefore, in the dodecagon, the lines that form the rectangle's sides must satisfy these properties.

But how do I find such sets of four lines? Maybe by considering the vectors between the points. If two vectors are perpendicular and their lengths are equal, then their corresponding sides could form a rectangle.

Alternatively, since the dodecagon is regular, perhaps the diagonals have specific lengths and angles that could help form rectangles. Let me think about the possible diagon
