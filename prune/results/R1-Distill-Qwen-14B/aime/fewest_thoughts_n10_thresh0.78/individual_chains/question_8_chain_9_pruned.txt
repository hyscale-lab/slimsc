Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300, and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that in problems involving symmetric expressions, sometimes it's helpful to use symmetric sums or even consider substituting variables. Let me see if I can express the given equation in terms of symmetric sums.

The given equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Let's see, each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another. So, for example, a²b and a²c are terms where a is squared and multiplied by b and c respectively. Similarly for the others.

I can factor this expression a bit. Let me try grouping terms:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, the entire expression becomes a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). Hmm, that's a bit simpler.

I also know that a + b + c = 300, so b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. Maybe I can substitute these into the equation.

So substituting, the expression becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me write that out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Hmm, combining like terms, we get:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

That's an interesting equation. So, 300 times the sum of squares minus the sum of cubes equals 6 million.

I recall that for symmetric equations with variables a, b, c, sometimes it's helpful to use the identities related to symmetric sums. Let me recall that:

(a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc).

Since a + b + c = 300, then:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc).

So, 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc).

Let me denote S = a² + b² + c² and T = ab + ac + bc. Then, from this equation, S + 2T = 90,000. So S = 90,000 - 2T.

Wait, but in our earlier transformed equation, we have 300S - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000. Let me denote U = a³ + b³ + c³. So, 300S - U = 6,000,000.

So, if I can express U in terms of S and T, maybe I can substitute.

I remember another identity: a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

So, U = 300³ - 3*300*T + 3abc.

Calculating 300³: 300*300 = 90,000; 90,000*300 = 27,000,000.

So, U = 27,000,000 - 900T + 3abc.

Now, plugging back into our equation: 300S - U = 6,000,000.

Substituting U, we get:

300S - (27,000,000 - 900T + 3abc) = 6,000,000.

Simplify this:

300S - 27,000,000 + 900T - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Let's rearrange the terms:

300S + 900T - 3abc = 6,000,000 + 27,000,000.

Which is:

300S + 900T - 3abc = 33,000,000.

Hmm, I can factor out 3 from all terms:

3(100S + 300T - abc) = 33,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100S + 300T - abc = 11,000,000.

Now, from earlier, we had S = 90,000 - 2T. So, let's substitute S into this equation:

100(90,000 - 2T) + 300T - abc = 11,000,000.

Calculate 100*90,000: 9,000,000. 100*(-2T) = -200T.

So,

9,000,000 - 200T + 300T - abc = 11,000,000.

Combine like terms:

9,000,000 + 100T - abc = 11,000,000.

Subtract 9,000,000 from both sides:

100T - abc = 2,000,000.

So,

abc = 100T - 2,000,000.

Hmm. Now, I have expressions involving S, T, and abc. Let me recap:

We know:

1) S = a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2T.

2) U = a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900T + 3abc.

3) From the earlier equation, abc = 100T - 2,000,000.

So, substituting abc into the expression for U:

U = 27,000,000 - 900T + 3(100T - 2,000,000).

Calculate 3*(100T - 2,000,000) = 300T - 6,000,000.

So,

U = 27,000,000 - 900T + 300T - 6,000,000.

Combine like terms:

27,000,000 - 6,000,000 = 21,000,000.

-900T + 300T = -600T.

So, U = 21,000,000 - 600T.

But U is a³ + b³ + c³, which is equal to 27,000,000 - 900T + 3abc, as per the identity.

Wait, but since we substituted abc in terms of T, we've now expressed U in terms of T as 21,000,000 - 600T.

Is there another way to express U? Let me think.

Alternatively, since U = a³ + b³ + c³, perhaps we can relate this to S and T. Wait, but I think we already used that identity.

I'm not sure if this approach is getting me closer to the solution. Maybe I should try a different strategy.

Another approach could be to consider that since a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding up to 300, perhaps we can set some variables in terms of others. For example, let's fix one variable
