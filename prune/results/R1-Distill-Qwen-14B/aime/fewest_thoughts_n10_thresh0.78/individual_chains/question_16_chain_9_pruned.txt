Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm. So first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. Once I find that p, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Let me start by understanding what it means for p² to divide n⁴ + 1. That is, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². That implies that n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p² because if I square both sides, (n⁴)^2 = n⁸ ≡ (-1)^2 = 1 mod p². So the order of n modulo p² divides 8 and also divides φ(p²), since by Euler's theorem, n^φ(p²) ≡ 1 mod p². φ(p²) is p(p-1), right? So the order of n modulo p² must divide both 8 and p(p-1).

Wait, that might be getting a bit ahead of myself. Maybe I should first try small primes and see if n⁴ +1 is divisible by p² for any n.

Let's list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. Let me check each one to see if p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

Starting with p=2. Then p²=4. So we need n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod 4. Let's compute n⁴ mod 4 for n=1,2,3,...

n=1: 1⁴=1, so 1+1=2≡2 mod4≠0.

n=2: 16≡0 mod4, so 0+1=1≡1 mod4≠0.

n=3: 81≡1 mod4, so 1+1=2≡2 mod4≠0.

n=4: 256≡0 mod4, same as n=2, so 0+1=1≡1 mod4.

It seems like for p=2, n⁴ +1 is never divisible by 4. So p=2 is out.

Next prime is p=3. p²=9.

Check n⁴ +1 mod9.

Compute n⁴ mod9:

n=1: 1 mod9, 1+1=2≠0.

n=2: 16 mod9=7, 7+1=8≠0.

n=3: 81 mod9=0, 0+1=1≠0.

n=4: 256 mod9. Let's compute 4^2=16 mod9=7, so 4^4=(4²)^2=7²=49 mod9=4. 4+1=5≠0.

n=5: 5^4. 5 mod9=5. 5²=25 mod9=7. 5^4=(5²)^2=7²=49 mod9=4. 4+1=5≠0.

n=6: 6 mod9=6. 6²=36 mod9=0. 6^4=0 mod9, so 0+1=1≠0.

n=7: 7 mod9=7. 7²=49 mod9=4. 7^4=4²=16 mod9=7. 7+1=8≠0.

n=8: 8 mod9=8. 8²=64 mod9=1. 8^4=(8²)^2=1²=1 mod9. 1+1=2≠0.

n=9: same as n=0, 0+1=1≠0.

So for p=3, n⁴ +1 is never divisible by 9. So p=3 is out.

Next prime, p=5. p²=25.

Compute n⁴ mod25. Let's check n=1 to 12 (since beyond that it's symmetric modulo 25).

n=1: 1 mod25, 1+1=2≠0.

n=2: 16 mod25, 16+1=17≠0.

n=3: 81 mod25=6, 6+1=7≠0.

n=4: 256 mod25. 25*10=250, so 256-250=6. 6+1=7≠0.

n=5: 625 mod25=0, 0+1=1≠0.

n=6: 6^4. 6²=36, 36 mod25=11. 6^4=11²=121 mod25=21. 21+1=22≠0.

n=7: 7²=49 mod25=24. 7^4=24²=576 mod25. 25*23=575, so 576-575=1. 1+1=2≠0.

n=8: 8²=64 mod25=14. 8^4=14²=196 mod25=21. 21+1=22≠0.

n=9: 9²=81 mod25=6. 9^4=6²=36 mod25=11. 11+1=12≠0.

n=10: 10^4 mod25=0, 0+1=1≠0.

n=11: 11 mod25=11. 11²=121 mod25=21. 11^4=21²=441 mod25=16. 16+1=17≠0.

n=12: 12 mod25=12. 12²=144 mod25=19. 12^4=19²=361 mod25=11. 11+1=12≠0.

n=13: same as n= -12 mod25. Let's compute 13²=169 mod25=19, 13^4=19²=361 mod25=11. 11+1=12≠0.

Wait, maybe I should check higher n. Let me check n=7: I had 7^4=1 mod25, so 1+1=2≠0.

n=2: 16, 16+1=17.

Wait, maybe n=17? Wait, 17 is beyond 25, but let's see:

Wait, maybe I'm not checking the right n. Perhaps n=7: 7^4=1 mod25, so 1+1=2. n= 17 is 17²=289 mod25=14, 17^4=14²=196 mod25=21. 21+1=22.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Is there an n where n⁴ ≡-1 mod25?

Wait, -1 mod25 is 24. So does any n⁴ ≡24 mod25?

Let me see.

Let me compute n⁴ mod25 for n from 1 to 24.

Wait, that's a lot, but perhaps there's a smarter way.

We can note that if n is coprime to 25, then by Euler's theorem, n^φ(25)=n^20≡1 mod25. So n^4 would have an order dividing 5, perhaps.

Wait, maybe I can check if 24 is a 4th power residue mod25. Let's see.

We can check each n=0 to 24 and compute n^4 mod25. Let's do that.

n | n^4 mod25

2:16

3:81=6

4:256=6

5:0

6:1296. Let's compute 6²=36, 6^4=36²=1296. 1296 ÷25: 25*51=1275, 1296-1275=21. So 21.

7:7²=49→24; 7^4=24²=576→576-23*25=576-575=1.

8:8²=64→14; 8^4=14²=196→196-7*25=196-175=21.

9:9²=81→6; 9^4=6²=36→11.

18:18²=324→24; 18^4=24²=576→1.

19:19²=361→11; 19^4=11²=121→21.

20:0

21:21²=441→16; 21^4=16²=256→6.

22:22²=484→9; 22^4=9²=81→6.

23:23²=529→4; 23^4=4²=16.

24:24²=576→1; 24^4=1²=1.

Wait, let me check n=7: n^4=1 mod25. So 1+1=2≠0.

n=2: 16, 16+1=17≠0.

n=3:6+1=7.

n=4:6+1=7.

n=6:21+1=22.

n=8:21+1=22.

n=9:11+1=12.

n=11:16+1=17.

n=12:11+1=12.

n=13:11+1=12.

n=14:16+1=17.

n=16:11+1=12.

n=17:21+1=22.

n=18:1+1=2.

n=19:21+1=22.

n=21:6+1=7.

n=22:6+1=7.

n=23:16+1=17.

n=24:1+1=2.

Hmm, so none of these n have n⁴ ≡24 mod25. So for p=5, p²=25 does not divide n⁴ +1 for any n. So p=5 is out.

Next prime, p=7. p²=49.

We need to check if there exists an n where n⁴ ≡-1 mod49. That is, n⁴ ≡48 mod49.

Again, let's try to find such an n.

First, let's note that if n is coprime to 49, then by Euler's theorem, n^42 ≡1 mod49, so the order of n modulo49 divides 42. The order of n^4 modulo49 would then divide 42 divided by gcd(4, order(n)).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to try some small n and see if n^4 ≡48 mod49.

Let's try n=2: 2^4=16. 16≠48.

n=3: 81 mod49=81-49=32. 32≠48.
