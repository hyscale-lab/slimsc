Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to understand it. It says, "Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p²."

Hmm. So, we need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Then, once we find that p, we need to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Let me break this down. First, find the smallest prime p such that there's an n with n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². Then, find the smallest m for that p.

I remember that for primes p, whether -1 is a quartic residue modulo p² depends on certain conditions. Maybe I should start by checking small primes and see which is the first one that satisfies this condition.

Let me list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.

I should check each prime p and see if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². The smallest p where this is true will be our p. Then, for that p, find the smallest m.

Let me start with p=2. Let's see if 2²=4 divides n⁴ +1 for some n. Let's compute n⁴ +1 mod 4.

If n is even, say n=2k, then n⁴ = (2k)^4 = 16k^4 ≡ 0 mod 4. So n⁴ +1 ≡ 1 mod 4.

If n is odd, n=2k+1, then n² = (2k+1)^2 = 4k² +4k +1 ≡1 mod 4. Then n⁴ = (n²)^2 ≡1²=1 mod4. So n⁴ +1 ≡2 mod4.

So for p=2, whether n is even or odd, n⁴ +1 is either 1 or 2 mod4. So 4 doesn't divide n⁴ +1 for any n. So p=2 is out.

Next, p=3. Let's see if there's n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod9.

Compute n⁴ mod9 for n=1 to 8:

n=1: 1^4=1 mod9 → 1≡-1? No, since -1 mod9 is 8.
n=2: 16 mod9=7 → 7≡-1? 7 is not 8, so no.
n=3: 81 mod9=0 → 0≡-1? No.
n=4: 256 mod9. 256/9 is 28*9=252, 256-252=4 → 4≡-1? 4≠8.
n=5: 625. 625-69*9=625-621=4 → 4≡-1? No.
n=6: 1296 → 0 mod9.
n=7: 7^4= (49)^2=2401. 2401 mod9: 2+4+0+1=7 → 7 mod9. 7≡-1? No.
n=8: 8^4=4096. 4096 mod9: 4+0+9+6=19 → 1+9=10 →1 mod9. 1≡-1? No.

So for p=3, n⁴ mod9 doesn't equal 8. So 3² doesn't divide any n⁴ +1. So p=3 is out.

Next, p=5. Let's check if there's n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod25.

Compute n⁴ mod25 for n=1 to 24.

But maybe I can find a pattern or use Euler's theorem. Since 25 is 5², and φ(25)=20. So exponents cycle every 20.

But n⁴ mod25: Let me try some numbers.

n=1: 1 mod25. Not -1.
n=2: 16. 16≡-1? 16+1=17, nope.
n=3: 81 mod25=81-3*25=6. 6≡-1? No.
n=4: 256 mod25. 256/25=10*25=250, 256-250=6. 6≡-1? No.
n=5: 0 mod25.
n=6: 6⁴=1296. 1296/25=51*25=1275, 1296-1275=21. 21≡-1? 21+1=22≠0, no.
n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401 mod25. 2401-96*25=2401-2400=1. 1≡-1? No.
n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod25. 4096-163*25=4096-4075=21. 21≡-1? No.
n=9: 9⁴=6561. 6561 mod25. 6561-262*25=6561-6550=11. 11≡-1? No.
n=10: 0 mod25.
n=11: 11⁴=14641. 14641 mod25. 14641-585*25=14641-14625=16. 16≡-1? No.
n=12: 12⁴=20736. 20736 mod25. 20736-829*25=20736-20725=11. No.
n=13: 13⁴=28561. 28561 mod25. 28561-1142*25=28561-28550=11. No.
n=14: 14⁴=38416. 38416 mod25. 38416-1536*25=38416-38400=16. No.
n=15: 0 mod25.
n=16:16⁴=65536. 65536 mod25. 65536-2621*25=65536-65525=11. No.
n=17:17⁴=83521. 83521 mod25. 83521-3340*25=83521-83500=21. No.
n=18:18⁴=104976. 104976 mod25. 104976-4199*25=104976-104975=1. No.
n=19:19⁴=130321. 130321 mod25. 130321-5212*25=130321-130300=21. No.
n=20:20⁴=160000 → 0 mod25.
n=21:21⁴=194481 mod25. 194481-7779*25=194481-194475=6. No.
n=22:22⁴=234256 mod25. 234256-9370*25=234256-234250=6. No.
n=23:23⁴=279841 mod25. 279841-11193*25=279841-279825=16. No.
n=24:24⁴=331776 mod25. 331776-13271*25=331776-331775=1. No.

Wait, none of these n from 1 to 24 give n⁴ ≡24 mod25, which is equivalent to -1 mod25. Hmm. So maybe p=5 is not the prime we're looking for. That means I need to check the next prime.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check n=7: 7^4=2401. 2401 /25: 25*96=2400, so 2401 mod25 is 1. No. So no solution for p=5. Hmm.

Moving on to p=7. Let's check if there exists an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod49.

Again, perhaps I can compute n⁴ mod49 for n from 1 to 48. But that's a lot. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the equation n⁴ ≡ -1 mod49. Let's see if such an n exists.

First, consider modulo7. For n⁴ ≡ -1 mod7. Since 7 is prime, let's see if n⁴ ≡6 mod7.

But for n mod7, n^4 mod7
