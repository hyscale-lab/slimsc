Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me carefully read through it again and try to break it down.

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis at half a unit, and B is on the y-axis a bit higher, since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. 

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ is in the first quadrant, P is somewhere on the x-axis, Q somewhere on the y-axis, and the distance between P and Q is 1. 

We need to find a unique point C on segment AB, not being A or B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. Then, we have to compute OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, then find p + q.

Hmm, okay. Let me try visualizing this. AB is a line segment from A to B. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), AB is a line in the first quadrant. So, any point C on AB can be expressed parametrically. 

Each segment PQ is a line from (p, 0) to (0, q) with p>0, q>0, and the distance between (p, 0) and (0, q) is 1. So, the distance formula gives sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1, meaning p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, all these segments PQ lie on the line p^2 + q^2 = 1, but in the first quadrant.

Wait no, actually, each PQ is a segment from (p,0) to (0,q) where p and q are such that sqrt(p² + q²) =1. So, each PQ is a line segment of length 1, stretching from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant.

So, the family F consists of all such segments PQ, each of length 1, with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis.

Now, AB is one of these segments. Let me check: point A is at (1/2, 0) and point B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment of length 1, so AB is in F.

So, the family F includes AB and all other such segments. So, AB is part of F.

Now, the problem says there is a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, this point C is on AB, and for any other segment PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

Then, we need to find OC².

I think the strategy is to parametrize AB and find such a point C on AB that it's not on any other PQ in F. So, let's parametrize AB.

First, let's find the equation of line AB.

Points A (1/2, 0) and B (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope m is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Since it passes through point A (1/2, 0), substituting:

0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2.

So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, any point C on AB can be written as (t, -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2), where t ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Wait, t goes from 0 to 1/2 because when x=1/2, y=0, which is point A, and when x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2, which is point B.

So, parametrizing AB: for t in [0, 1/2], the point is (t, sqrt(3)(1/2 - t)).

Alternatively, let me use a parameter s between 0 and 1. So, point C can be expressed as A + s*(B - A). Let's do that.

Vector AB is B - A = (-1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, point C is A + s*(B - A) = (1/2, 0) + s*(-1/2, sqrt(3)/2) = (1/2 - s/2, 0 + s*sqrt(3)/2). So, C is at ( (1 - s)/2 , (sqrt(3) s)/2 ), where s is in [0,1].

So, when s=0, we are at A, and s=1, at B.

Now, we need to find point C on AB (so, for some s in (0,1)) such that C is not on any other segment PQ in F except AB.

So, first, let's think about what it means for a point C to lie on a segment PQ in F. So, for some p and q such that p^2 + q^2 =1, with p >0, q>0, the segment PQ goes from (p, 0) to (0, q). 

If C is on PQ, then it must satisfy the equation of line PQ. So, let's find the equation of PQ.

Given points P(p, 0) and Q(0, q), the equation of PQ can be written as x/p + y/q = 1.

So, if C(x, y) is on PQ, then x/p + y/q =1
