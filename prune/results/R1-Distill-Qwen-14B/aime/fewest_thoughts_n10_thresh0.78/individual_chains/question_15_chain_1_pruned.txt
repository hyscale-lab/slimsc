Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and they change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in a grid, moving from one corner to the opposite usually involves moving right and up. For an 8x8 grid, to go from the lower left to the upper right, you have to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up. So the total number of steps is 16, which makes sense because each step is either right or up.

Now, normally, without any restrictions on direction changes, the number of paths would be the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But here, the problem is more specific: we're supposed to count only those paths that change direction exactly four times.

Wait, what's a direction change? I think it's when the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right. So, for example, if you start moving right, then switch to up, that's one change. If you switch back to right, that's another change, and so on.

So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, how does that affect the structure of the path? Let's think. Each time you change direction, you're switching between right and up. So, the number of direction changes relates to the number of runs or consecutive segments in each direction.

Wait, actually, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of segments. For example, if you have a path that goes right, then up, then right, then up, then right, that's four direction changes, which means five segments. Hmm, but in our case, it's exactly four direction changes. So, that would mean five segments? No, wait: Starting direction is the first segment, then each change adds a new segment. So, if you have four direction changes, you have five segments in total. But wait, in our case, since a path must start in one direction, right or up, but actually, on a grid, from lower left to upper right, you can't start with up because you'd have to go up before moving right
