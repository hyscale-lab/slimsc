Alright, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

The hyperbola given is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along x, and the conjugate axis along y.

Now, the points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, and ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

I need to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I'm looking for the infimum of BD², but they want the greatest number that's less than BD² for any such rhombus. So, it's like the minimum value that BD² can approach but not necessarily reach.

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Because in a rhombus, which is a type of parallelogram, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, yes, diagonals are perpendicular.

So, that might come into play here.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the points A, B, C, D are arranged such that the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin.

Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other, the origin is the midpoint of both AC and BD. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C should be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (u, v), then point D should be (-u, -v).

But wait, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are equal in length. So, the vectors from A to B and B to C should have the same magnitude.

Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1. Wait, maybe that's a useful approach.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider parametric equations for points on the hyperbola.

Given the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, I can parameterize the points A, B, C, D.

For hyperbolas, a common parametrization is using hyperbolic functions. So, points on the hyperbola can be represented as (a sec θ, b tan θ), where a² = 20 and b² = 24. So, a = 2√5, b = 2
