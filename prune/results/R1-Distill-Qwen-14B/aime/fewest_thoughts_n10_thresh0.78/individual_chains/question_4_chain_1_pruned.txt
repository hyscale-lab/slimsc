Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first, and on each turn a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's break this down. It seems like a combinatorial game problem, probably involving something called "winning positions" and "losing positions." A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, the goal is to find the losing positions for the starting player, because that's when Bob can win. Since Alice goes first, if the starting position is a losing position, then Bob can win with optimal play. So we need to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position.

Let me think about how to model this. Maybe I can use dynamic programming to figure out for each n whether it's a winning or losing position.

Let's denote:
- P(n) = True if the current player can force a win with n tokens.
- P(n) = False otherwise.

The base case is when n=0, which is a losing position because the player can't make a move, but wait, n=0 is when the previous player took the last token, so actually, the current player loses. So P(0) = False.

Wait, but in the problem, the player who takes the last token wins. So if n=1, the current player can take 1 token and win. So P(1) = True.

Similarly, for n=2, the current player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then can take it and win. Wait, but if the current player takes 1, opponent takes 1 and wins. So is there another move? The current player can't take 4 because n=2 <4, so only option is to take 1. So P(2) would be False because the current player can't force a win, correct?

Wait, no, wait. If n=2, current player takes 1, leaving 1 for the opponent. Opponent takes 1 and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for the current player. So P(2)=False.

Similarly, n=3: current player can take 1, leaving 2 for the opponent. If n=2 is a losing position, then the opponent can't win, so the current player can force a win by taking 1. So P(3)=True.

n=4: current player can take 4 and win immediately. So P(4)=True.

n=5: current player can take 1, leaving 4 tokens. Since P(4)=True, the opponent can win. Or, the current player can take 4, leaving 1 token. Then the opponent takes 1 and wins. So regardless of what the current player does, the opponent can win. So n=5 is a losing position for the current player. So P(5)=False.

Wait, so let's summarize:

n | P(n)
0 | False
1 | True
2 | False
