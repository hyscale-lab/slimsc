Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to parse it out step by step. 

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and then stops at a coffee shop. The problem gives me two scenarios with different walking speeds and the time each takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the t minutes in the coffee shop.

Alright, let's break down the information given.

First scenario:
- She walks at a constant speed of s km/h.
- The total time for the walk, including t minutes in the coffee shop, is 4 hours.

Wait, but wait. Wait, when you walk, you spend time walking plus time at the coffee shop. So the total time is the time spent walking plus the time in the coffee shop. So in the first case, the walking time plus t minutes equals 4 hours. But the problem says the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes. So I think that means 4 hours total, which includes both walking and the coffee shop time.

Similarly, the second scenario:
- She walks at s + 2 km/h.
- The total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes.

So, both scenarios include the coffee shop time in the total duration.

So, for the first scenario:
Total time = 4 hours = walking time + t minutes.

Similarly, second scenario:
Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = walking time + t minutes.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop." Hmm, maybe I misread. Maybe the walk duration is 4 hours excluding the coffee shop time. So the total time from leaving home to returning would be 4 hours plus t minutes. But the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Let me read the problem again:

"When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop."

Hmm, so it says the walk takes 4 hours, including t minutes. So I think that 4 hours is the total time from starting the walk until she's done with the coffee shop. So the 4 hours includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time.

Similarly, the second scenario: "the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop."

So both cases, the total time is the sum of the walking time and the coffee shop time.

So given that, for a 9-km walk, the time she spends walking at speed s is (9)/s hours, and the coffee shop time is t minutes. Similarly, the time walking at s+2 km/h is (9)/(s+2) hours, and the coffee shop time is t minutes.

But wait, in the first case, the total time is 4 hours, which would be (9/s) hours + t minutes. But t is given in minutes, so I need to convert everything to the same units. Let's convert all times to hours.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to convert everything to minutes. Let me think.

Let me try converting all times to minutes.

So, 4 hours is 240 minutes.

2 hours and 24 minutes is 2*60 +24 = 144 minutes.

So, first scenario:

Walking time (in minutes) + t = 240.

Walking time is (9 km)/(s km/h) * 60 minutes/hour = (9/s)*60 minutes.

So, (9/s)*60 + t = 240.

Similarly, second scenario:

Walking time is (9)/(s+2) hours *60 minutes/hour = (9/(s+2))*60 minutes.

So, (9/(s+2))*60 + t = 144.

So now I have two equations:

1) (9/s)*60 + t = 240

2) (9/(s+2))*60 + t = 144

Hmm, so these are two equations with two variables: s and t.

If I subtract equation 2 from equation 1, I can eliminate t.

So:

[(9/s)*60 + t] - [(9/(s+2))*60 + t] = 240 - 144

Simplify:

(9*60)(1/s - 1/(s+2)) = 96

Compute 9*60 = 540.

So,

540*(1/s - 1/(s+2)) = 96

Let me compute the difference in the fractions:

1/s -1/(s+2) = [ (s+2) - s ] / [s(s+2)] = 2/(s(s+2))

So,

540*(2/(s(s+2))) = 96

So,

1080/(s(s+2)) = 96

Multiply both sides by s(s+2):

1080 = 96 s (s + 2 )

Divide both sides by 96:

1080 /96 = s(s+2)

Let me compute 1080 ÷ 96.

Hmm, 96 * 11 = 1056.

1080 - 1056 = 24.

So, 1080/96 = 11 + 24/96 = 11 + 1/4 = 11.25.

So,

s(s + 2) = 11.25

Which is:

s² + 2s -11.25 =0

Quadratic equation in s.

Let me solve for s.

s = [ -2 ± sqrt(4 + 45) ] / 2

Because discriminant D = (2)^2 + 4*11.25 = 4 +45=49.

So,

s = [ -2 ±7 ] /2

So possible solutions:

s = (5)/2 =2.5, or s= (-9)/2 = -4.5.

But speed can't be negative, so s=2.5 km/h.

So, s=2.5 km/h.

Now, let me find t.

From equation 1:

(9/s)*60 + t =240.

Plugging s=2.5:

(9/2.5)*60 + t =240.

Calculate 9/2.5 = 3.6

3.6 *60 = 216.

So,

216 + t =240

t=240-216=24 minutes.

So, t=24 minutes.

Now, the problem asks: Suppose Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

So, her new speed is s + 0.5 =2.5 +0.5=3 km/h.

So, walking speed is 3 km/h.

Walking time is 9 km / 3 km/h = 3 hours.

Convert to minutes: 3*60=180 minutes.

Plus t=24 minutes.

Total time:180 +24=204 minutes.

So, 204 minutes is the total time.

Wait, let me just cross-verify.

Wait, when she walks at 3 km/h, the time taken is 9/3=3 hours.

Plus 24 minutes coffee shop.

So, 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 is 204 minutes
