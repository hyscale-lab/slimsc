Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi ABCD. The rhombus is formed by four points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that for a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, but wait, no, that's actually a property of a square. For a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Oh, wait, no, actually, I think I'm confusing. Let me check. No, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, they are. Wait, no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me recall: a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Yes, that's right. So, the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, in this case, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals, and they are perpendicular.

So, the hyperbola is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right. The rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, so the diagonals are straight lines passing through the origin, and their intersection is the origin. So, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at the origin.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other. So, if the origin is the midpoint, then if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y) because the midpoint is the origin. Similarly, points B and D must also be symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if B is (a, b), then D is (-a, -b). So, the four points are A, B, (-x, -y), (-a, -b). But wait, no, the four points are A, B, C, D, so if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y), and if B is (a, b), then D is (-a, -b). So, ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at the origin.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, we can also use the properties of the diagonals in a rhombus.

Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other, so if diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, then the slopes of AC and BD should be negative reciprocals of each other, right? So, if one diagonal has a slope m, the other should have a slope -1/m.

But wait, since the diagonals pass through the origin, they are straight lines through the origin. So, for diagonal AC, connecting points A (x, y) and C (-x, -y), the slope is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. Similarly, for diagonal BD, connecting points B (a, b) and D (-a, -b), the slope is (b - (-b))/(a - (-a)) = (2b)/(2a) = b/a.

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, (y/x) * (b/a) = -1. So, (y*b)/(x*a) = -1. Therefore, y*b = -x*a. So, that's one condition.

Now, all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, substituting point A (x, y) into the hyperbola equation: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Similarly, point B (a, b) must satisfy a²/20 - b²/24 = 1.

So, now, I need to
