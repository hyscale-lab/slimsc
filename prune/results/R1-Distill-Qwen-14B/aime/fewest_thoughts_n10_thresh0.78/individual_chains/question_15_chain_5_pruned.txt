Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner and have a length of 16. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that on a grid, moving from one corner to the opposite corner typically involves moving right and up. For an 8x8 grid, you have to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So each path is a sequence of these right (R) and up (U) moves.

Now, the problem mentions that the paths change direction exactly four times. I need to figure out what this means in terms of the sequence of moves. A direction change happens when the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right. So, if a path starts with a right move, the first direction change occurs when it switches to an up move, and vice versa.

Let me consider an example. If a path goes R, R, U, U, R, R, U, U, and so on, each switch from R to U or U to R is a direction change. But wait, the starting direction is R, so if the first move is R, then changing to U is the first direction change. Similarly, changing back to R would be the second, and so on.

So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, how many segments of R and U moves do we have? Each direction change increases the number of segments by one. Starting from one segment (all R or all U), each change adds a new segment. So four direction changes would result in five segments in total.

Wait, hold on. Let's clarify. The number of direction changes is one less than the number of segments. So, if you have four direction changes, that would split the path into five segments. Okay, so the path is divided into five parts, each part being a consecutive sequence of R's or U's.

Each segment must consist of at least one move, right? So, each of these five segments is either a series of R's or U's, and they alternate. So, for example, if the first segment is R, the next must be U, then R, then U, etc., or it could start with U and alternate.

But wait, since the grid is 8x8, the total number of R's must be 8 and the total number of U's must also be 8. So, the sum of all R segments is 8, and the sum of all U segments is 8. Each segment is at least length 1.

So, the problem reduces to partitioning the 8 R's into 5 segments (if starting with R) or 4 segments (if starting with U, but wait, no). Wait, no, the number of segments is five regardless of starting direction. Because four direction changes give five segments.

Wait, hold on, no. Let me think again. Suppose the path starts with R, then U, R, U, R, U, R, U, R. That's four direction changes, resulting
