Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance should be in the form m√n / p, and then I have to find m + n + p. Alright, let me try to break this down.

First, let me note down the given information:

- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

So, all opposite edges are equal. That's interesting. I remember that in a tetrahedron, if opposite edges are equal, it's called a "equilateral" tetrahedron, but I'm not sure if that's the correct term. Maybe it's a "biscribed" tetrahedron? Wait, no, biscribed usually refers to having both an insphere and a circumsphere. Hmm, maybe it's called a "isohedral" tetrahedron? Or perhaps "edge-transitive." I'm not entirely sure, but regardless, the key here is that opposite edges are equal.

I think this symmetry might help me in calculating the volume and other properties. So, the goal is to find the inradius, which is the distance from the incenter to each face. I remember that for a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area.

So, if I can find the volume V and the total surface area S, then I can calculate r. Let's start by trying to compute V.

But to compute the volume, I might need the coordinates of the vertices. Maybe it would be easier to place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system in such a way that calculations are simplified.

Let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices. Since opposite edges are equal, perhaps I can center the tetrahedron at the origin or something. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can place the points such that opposite edges are symmetric.

Wait, I recall that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it's called a "disphenoid." Yes, that's the term. So, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. So, that must be what this is. So, in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, is that true? Let me think. If all opposite edges are equal, then each face would have sides a, b, c where a = opposite a, etc. So, each face is congruent, so yes, all four faces are congruent triangles.

So, in such a case, the tetrahedron is symmetric, and the inradius can be found more easily.

But maybe I should just assign coordinates to the vertices to compute the volume. Let's try that.

Let me try to place the points in such a way that the centroid is at the origin,
