Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from a set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The answer should be in the form p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q.

Hmm, okay. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, a rectangular box has three dimensions: length (let's say x), width (y), and height (z). The surface area S of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + zx) and the volume V is xyz.

Given that S = 54 and V = 23, so that's two equations:

1. 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 → xy + yz + zx = 27
2. xyz = 23

The sphere that can contain the box must have a radius equal to half the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So the radius r is d/2, so r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

Therefore, I need to find the minimal value of sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2, which is equivalent to finding the minimal value of (x² + y² + z²)/4. So I need to minimize x² + y² + z² given that 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Wait, so I need to minimize x² + y² + z² with those constraints. How can I approach this?

I know that for optimization problems with constraints, Lagrange multipliers might be useful here. Alternatively, maybe I can express variables in terms of each other to reduce the number of variables.

Let me think about using Lagrange multipliers. Let’s set up the function to minimize: f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to two constraints:

1. g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx = 27
2. h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23

So the Lagrangian would be:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + zx - 27) - μ(xyz -23)

Then, we can take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, λ, μ and set them equal to zero.

Compute the partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0
∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0
∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0

And the constraints:

xy + yz + zx = 27
xyz =23

So now, we have five equations:

1. 2x = λ(y + z) + μ yz
2. 2y = λ(x + z) + μ xz
3. 2z = λ(x + y) + μ xy
4. xy + yz + zx =27
5. xyz =23

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can find symmetry or assume some variables are equal.

If the box is a cube, then x = y = z. Let's test if that's possible.

If x = y = z, then surface area would be 6x² =54 → x²=9 → x=3. Then volume would be 27, but the volume here is 23, which is less than 27. So it's not a cube. So the box is not a cube, so variables are not all equal.

But perhaps two variables are equal. Let's suppose x = y, and see if that holds.

Let x = y. Then, the two equations from partial derivatives 1 and 2 should be the same.

Equation 1: 2x = λ(x + z) + μ xz
Equation 2: 2x = λ(x + z) + μ xz
Equation 3: 2z = λ(2x) + μ x²

So the first two equations are the same, and the third is different.

So from equation 3: 2z = 2λx + μ x².

Also, the constraints become:

xy + yz + zx = x² + 2xz =27
xyz =x² z =23

So, since x² z =23, z =23/(x²).

Plug into the surface area equation: x² + 2x*(23/x²) =27

Simplify:

x² + (46)/x =27

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ +46 =27x

So x³ -27x +46 =0

Let me try to find rational roots. By Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are factors of 46 over 1: ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46=20≠0
x=2:8-54+46=0→ x=2 is a root.

So (x-2)(x² +2x -23)=0. So other roots are solutions to x² +2x -23=0 → x=(-2±sqrt(4+92))/2=(-2±sqrt(96))/2=(-2±4*sqrt(6))/2= -1 ±2√6

Since x is positive, x= -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898≈3.898. So real roots are x=2 and x≈3.898.

So x=2 is a solution. Let me check if that works.

If x=2, then z=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So the dimensions are x=y=2, z=5.75.

Check if this satisfies the surface area: x² +2xz= 4 + 2*(2*5.75)=4 + 2*11.5=4+23=27. Yes, that works.

So this is a possible solution. Now, is this the minimal case? Because sometimes assuming two variables equal might not give the minimal value, but sometimes it does.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal sphere occurs when the box is as close to a cube as possible, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's suppose that x, y, z are all different.

But perhaps using Lagrange multipliers, we can find a relationship between variables.

Let me write the partial derivatives:

From equations 1,2,3:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ yz ...(1)
2y = λ(x + z) + μ xz ...(2)
2z = λ(x + y) + μ xy ...(3)

Let me subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

2y - 2x = λ(x + z - y - z) + μ(xz - yz)

Simplify:

2(y - x) = λ(x - y) + μ z (x - y)

Factor out (x - y):

2(y - x) = (x - y)(λ + μ z)

Divide both sides by (y - x) (assuming y ≠ x):

-2 = -(λ + μ z)

So λ + μ z=2 ...(a)

Similarly, subtract equation (2) - equation (3):

2y - 2z = λ(x + z - x - y) + μ (xz - xy)

Simplify:

2(y - z)= λ(z - y) + μ x (z - y)

Factor out (y - z):

2(y - z)= (z - y)(λ + μ x )

Divide both sides by (y - z) (assuming y ≠ z):

-2 = -(λ + μ x )

So λ + μ x=2 ...(b)

Similarly, from equation (a) and (b):

λ + μ z = 2
λ + μ x = 2

Subtract them:

μ(z - x)=0

So either μ=0 or z=x.

If μ=0, then from equation (a), λ=2.

Then let's see if μ=0 is possible.

If μ=0, then equation (1):

2x=λ(y + z)

Similarly, equation (2):

2y=λ(x + z)

Equation (3):

2z= λ(x + y)

So from equation (1): 2x = λ(y + z)
From equation (2): 2y=λ(x + z)
From equation (3): 2z=λ(x + y)

Let me write ratio of equation (1) and equation (2):

(2x)/(2y) = [λ(y + z)]/[λ(x + z)] → x/y = (y + z)/(x + z)

Cross-multiplying: x(x + z) = y(y + z)

So x² + x z = y² + y z → x² - y²= z(y -x) → (x - y)(x + y) = -z(x - y)

Assuming x ≠ y, we can divide both sides by (x - y):

x + y = -z

But x, y, z are positive (they are dimensions), so this would imply x + y is negative, which is impossible. Therefore, x = y.

Similarly, from other ratios, if μ=0, we can deduce x = y = z, which would make it a cube, but we already saw that x=y=z=3 gives a volume of 27, not 23. So μ=0 is not a feasible solution.

Therefore, we must have z = x.

So from μ(z - x)=0, since μ≠0, z=x.

So z = x.

So, with z = x, let's see.

From the constraints:

xy + yz + zx =27 → x y + y x + x²=27 → 2 x y + x²=27.

Volume: x y z= x y x= x² y =23 → x² y=23.

So from volume, y=23/(x²).

Substitute into surface area equation:

2x*(23/x²) +x²=27 → 46/x +x²=27.

Multiply both sides by x:

46 +x³=27x →x³ -27x +46=0.

Wait, this is the same equation as before when I assumed x=y.

So, the equation is x³ -27x +46=0.

We found that x=2 is a root, so factor it as (x-2)(x² +2x -23)=0.

So, solutions x=2, and x=(-2 ±sqrt(4 +92))/2= (-2 ±sqrt(96))/2= (-2 ±4*sqrt(6))/2= -1 ±2√6.

Since x>0, x=2 and x=-1 +2√6≈3.898.

So, if x=2, then z=x=2, and y=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

If x=-1 +2√6, then y=23/(x²). Let me compute x²:

x= -1 +2√6 → x²=1 -4√6 + (2√6)^2=1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

So y=23/(25 -4√6). To rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

y=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2]=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify 23/529=1/23.

So y=(25 +4√6)/23.

So in this case, the dimensions are x=y=z= x≈3.898? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in this case, z=x, but x is not equal to y.

Wait, hold on. If z=x, then the box has dimensions x, y, x, with y=23/(x²). So when x=2, y=23/4, as before.

But when x= -1 +2√6, which is approximately 3.898, y=(25 +4√6)/23≈(25 +9.798)/23≈34.798/23≈1.513.

So, in this case, the box is x≈3.898, y≈1.513, z≈3.898.

Which is a box where two sides are longer, and one is shorter.

Now, which of these two cases gives a smaller x²+y²+z²?

Because we need to find the minimal sphere, which would correspond to the minimal space diagonal squared, which is x²+y²+z².

So, let's compute x²+y²+z² for both cases.

Case 1: x=y=2, z=23/4=5.75.

Compute x² + y² + z²= 2² +2² + (23/4)^2=4 +4 + (529/16)=8 +529/16= (128 +529)/16=657/16≈41.0625.

Case 2: x= -1 +2√6, y=(25 +4√6)/23, z=x.

Compute x² + y² + z²=2x² + y².

First, x= -1 +2√6, so x²=1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

Then, y=(25 +4√6)/23, so y²=(25 +4√6)^2 /23²= (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529=(721 +200√6)/529.

So, 2x² + y²=2*(25 -4√6) + (721 +200√6)/529.

Compute 2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

So, 50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

Convert 50 -8√6 to over 529 denominator:

50 = 50*529/529=26450/529.

-8√6= -8√6*529/529= -4232√6/529.

So total is (26450 -4232√6 +721 +200√6)/529.

Combine like terms:

26450 +721=27171.

-4232√6 +200√6= (-4232 +200)√6= -4032√6.

So numerator is 27171 -4032√6.

Thus, 2x² + y²= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

We can compute this numerically to compare with case 1.

Compute numerator: 27171 ≈27171, 4032√6≈4032*2.449≈4032*2.449≈9891.

So numerator≈27171 -9891≈17280.

Denominator=529≈529.

So 17280 /529≈32.67.

Compare with case1:≈41.06.

So clearly, case2 gives a smaller x² + y² + z².

Therefore, the minimal x² + y² + z² is (27171 -4032√6)/529.

So, r²= (x² + y² + z²)/4= [ (27171 -4032√6)/529 ] /4= (27171 -4032√6)/(529*4)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

But this seems complicated, maybe I can simplify.

Wait, let me check my calculations again, perhaps I made an error.

Wait, 2x² + y² when x= -1 +2√6.

x= -1 +2√6.

x²= (-1)^2 + (2√6)^2 + 2*(-1)(2√6)=
