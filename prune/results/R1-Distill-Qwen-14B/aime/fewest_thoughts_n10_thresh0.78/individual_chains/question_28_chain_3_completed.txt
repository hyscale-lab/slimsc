Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a tetrahedron. The tetrahedron is labeled ABCD, and it has some specific edge lengths. The edges AB and CD are both √41, AC and BD are √80, and BC and AD are √89. I need to find the distance from a special point inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces. This point is such that its distances to all four faces are equal. The answer should be in the form m√n / p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, I have to find m + n + p.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter. The incenter is the center of the inscribed sphere (inradius) that touches each face. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

To find the inradius, I recall that it's related to the volume and the surface area of the tetrahedron. The formula is:
r = 3V / S
where V is the volume, and S is the total surface area.

So, my plan is:
1. Find the volume of the tetrahedron.
2. Calculate the areas of each of the four faces.
3. Sum these areas to get the total surface area S.
4. Use the formula r = 3V / S to find the inradius.

But before I can do that, I need to figure out the volume. Since the edge lengths are given, maybe I can use coordinates to model the tetrahedron. Assigning coordinates might make it easier to compute the volume.

Let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices. Let's place vertex A at the origin (0, 0, 0). Then, let me assign coordinates to B, C, D such that the given edge lengths are satisfied.

Let me denote:
A = (0, 0, 0)
B = (x1, y1, z1)
C = (x2, y2, z2)
D = (x3, y3, z3)

Now, given the edge lengths, I can set up equations based on distances.

First, AB = √41. So, distance from A to B:
√(x1² + y1² + z1²) = √41 => x1² + y1² + z1² = 41.

Similarly, AC = √80, so distance from A to C:
√(x2² + y2² + z2²) = √80 => x2² + y2² + z2² = 80.

AD = √89, so distance from A to D:
√(x3² + y3² + z3²) = √89 => x3² + y3² + z3² = 89.

Next, CD = √41. Distance from C to D:
√( (x3 - x2)² + (y3 - y2)² + (z3 - z2)² ) = √41 => (x3 - x2)² + (y3 - y2)² + (z3 - z2)² = 41.

Similarly, BD = √80. Distance from B to D:
√( (x3 - x1)² + (y3 - y1)² + (z3 - z1)² ) = √80 => (x3 - x1)² + (y3 - y1)² + (z3 - z1)² = 80.

And BC = √89. Distance from B to C:
√( (x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)² + (z2 - z1)² ) = √89 => (x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)² + (z2 - z1)² = 89.

Hmm, this seems complicated with so many variables. Maybe there's a better way to assign coordinates to make the problem symmetric or easier.

I notice that the edge lengths come in pairs: AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So, the tetrahedron might be "isohedral," meaning that all its faces are congruent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might be a "kite" tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the tetrahedron is such that each pair of opposite edges are equal. So, AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. I think this is called a "equilic" tetrahedron or maybe "isoedged" tetrahedron. But I'm not certain.

Regardless, to model this, maybe I can place the points in a way that takes advantage of the symmetry. Let me try to position the points so that the coordinates are symmetric in some way.

Let me consider placing points B, C, D such that they are symmetric with respect to the origin or something. Alternatively, perhaps I can arrange the points so that the centroid is at the origin, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since opposite edges are equal, perhaps I can model this tetrahedron as two congruent triangles connected in a certain way. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system where the midpoints of opposite edges are at the origin or something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use vectors to represent the points and exploit the equal edge lengths.

Let me consider that vectors AB and CD are equal in length, vectors AC and BD are equal, etc.

Alternatively, let me think about the coordinates. Let me try to assign coordinates such that:

Let me suppose that the points are arranged as follows:

- Let point A be (a, b, c)
- Point B be (-a, -b, c)
- Point C be (-a, b, -c)
- Point D be (a, -b, -c)

This kind of symmetry might make the opposite edges equal. Let me check.

Compute AB: distance between A and B:
sqrt[ ( -a - a )² + ( -b - b )² + ( c - c )² ] = sqrt[ ( -2a )² + (-2b)^2 + 0 ] = sqrt[4a² + 4b²] = 2 sqrt(a² + b²).

Similarly, CD: distance between C and D:
sqrt[ (a - (-a))² + (-b - b)^2 + (-c - (-c))² ] = sqrt[ (2a)^2 + (-2b)^2 + 0 ] = same as AB, which is 2 sqrt(a² + b²). So, AB=CD.

Similarly, AC: distance between A and C:
sqrt[ (-a - a)^2 + (b - b)^2 + (-c - c)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-2a)^2 + 0 + (-2c)^2 ] = sqrt[4a² +4c²] = 2 sqrt(a² + c²).

Similarly, BD: distance between B and D:
sqrt[ (a - (-a))^2 + (-b - (-b))^2 + (-c - c)^2 ] = sqrt[ (2a)^2 + 0 + (-2c)^2 ] = same as AC. So AC=BD.

Similarly, BC: distance between B and C:
sqrt[ (-a - (-a))^2 + (b - (-b))^2 + (-c - c)^2 ] = sqrt[0 + (2b)^2 + (-2c)^2] = sqrt[4b² +4c²] = 2 sqrt(b² + c²).

Similarly, AD: distance between A and D:
sqrt[ (a - a)^2 + (-b - b)^2 + (-c - c)^2 ] = sqrt[0 + (-2b)^2 + (-2c)^2] = same as BC. So AD=BC.

So yes, this coordinate assignment would give AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So, if I set up the coordinates this way, the given edge lengths can be expressed as AB=CD=2 sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(41). So, 2 sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(41) => sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(41)/2 => a² + b² = 41/4.

Similarly, AC=BD=2 sqrt(a² + c²) = sqrt(80). So, sqrt(a² + c²) = sqrt(80)/2 = (4 sqrt(5))/2 = 2 sqrt(5). So, a² + c² = (2 sqrt(5))² = 20.

Similarly, BC=AD=2 sqrt(b² + c²) = sqrt(89). So, sqrt(b² + c²) = sqrt(89)/2. Therefore, b² + c² = 89/4.

Now, I have three equations:

1. a² + b² = 41/4
2. a² + c² = 20
3. b² + c² = 89/4

I can solve for a², b², c².

Let me denote:

Equation 1: a² + b² = 41/4
Equation 2: a² + c² = 20
Equation 3: b² + c² = 89/4

Let me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:
(a² + c²) - (a² + b²) = 20 - 41/4 => c² - b² = 20 - 10.25 = 9.75 = 39/4

So, c² - b² = 39/4. Let's call this Equation 4.

From Equation 3: b² + c² = 89/4.

So, now, we have:

Equation 3: b² + c² = 89/4
Equation 4: c² - b² = 39/4

Let me add Equations 3 and 4:

(b² + c²) + (c² - b²) = 89/4 + 39/4 => 2c² = 128/4 = 32 => c² = 16 => c = 4 or c = -4.

From Equation 4: c² - b² = 39/4 => 16 - b² = 39/4 => b² = 16 - 39/4 = (64/4 - 39/4) = 25/4 => b = 5/2 or -5/2.

From Equation 1: a² + b² = 41/4 => a² + 25/4 = 41/4 => a² = 41/4 - 25/4 = 16/4 = 4 => a = 2 or -2.

So, we have:
a² = 4 => a = 2 or -2
b² = 25/4 => b = 5/2 or -5/2
c² = 16 => c = 4 or -4

Now, let's pick signs for a, b, c. Since in the coordinate assignment, A is (a, b, c), B is (-a, -b, c), C is (-a, b, -c), D is (a, -b, -c). So, the signs will determine the specific coordinates.

Let me choose a = 2, b = 5/2, c =4.

Therefore, the coordinates are:
A = (2, 5/2, 4)
B = (-2, -5/2, 4)
C = (-2, 5/2, -4)
D = (2, -5/2, -4)

Now, let me verify the distances to make sure.

Compute AB: sqrt[ (-2 - 2)^2 + (-5/2 -5/2)^2 + (4 -4)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-4)^2 + (-5)^2 + 0 ] = sqrt[16 +25] = sqrt[41]. Correct.

Compute AC: sqrt[ (-2 - 2)^2 + (5/2 -5/2)^2 + (-4 -4)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-4)^2 + 0 + (-8)^2 ] = sqrt[16 +64] = sqrt[80]. Correct.

Compute AD: sqrt[ (2 - 2)^2 + (-5/2 -5/2)^2 + (-4 -4)^2 ] = sqrt[0 + (-5)^2 + (-8)^2 ] = sqrt[25 +64] = sqrt[89]. Correct.

Similarly, CD: distance between C (-2,5/2,-4) and D (2,-5/2,-4):

sqrt[ (2 - (-2))^2 + (-5/2 -5/2)^2 + (-4 - (-4))^2 ] = sqrt[4^2 + (-5)^2 + 0 ] = sqrt[16 +25] = sqrt[41]. Correct.

BD: distance between B (-2,-5/2,4) and D (2,-5/2,-4):

sqrt[ (2 - (-2))^2 + ( -5/2 - (-5/2) )^2 + (-4 -4)^2 ] = sqrt[4^2 +0 + (-8)^2 ] = sqrt[16 +64] = sqrt[80]. Correct.

BC: distance between B (-2,-5/2,4) and C (-2,5/2,-4):

sqrt[ (-2 - (-2))^2 + (5/2 - (-5/2))^2 + (-4 -4)^2 ] = sqrt[0 +5^2 + (-8)^2 ] = sqrt[25 +64] = sqrt[89]. Correct.

Great, all distances check out.

Now, I need to compute the volume of tetrahedron ABCD. One way to compute the volume is using the scalar triple product formula:

V = | (AB · (AC × AD)) | / 6

But maybe in this coordinate system, it's better to compute using the determinant.

Alternatively, since I have coordinates for all four points, I can compute vectors AB, AC, AD, and then calculate the scalar triple product.

Wait, let me note the coordinates:

A = (2, 5/2, 4)
B = (-2, -5/2, 4)
C = (-2, 5/2, -4)
D = (2, -5/2, -4)

Compute vectors AB, AC, AD.

AB = B - A = (-2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, 4 -4) = (-4, -5, 0)
AC = C - A = (-2 -2, 5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (-4, 0, -8)
AD = D - A = (2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8)

Now, the scalar triple product [AB, AC, AD] is the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors as columns (or rows, depending on convention). The volume is 1/6 of the absolute value of this determinant.

Let me construct the matrix:

| -4   -4     0 |
| -5    0    -5 |
|  0   -8    -8 |

Wait, no. Wait, AB is (-4, -5, 0), AC is (-4, 0, -8), AD is (0, -5, -8). So, the vectors are:

AB = (-4, -5, 0)
AC = (-4, 0, -8)
AD = (0, -5, -8)

So, the scalar triple product is AB · (AC × AD). Let's compute AC × AD first.

Compute AC × AD:

AC = (-4, 0, -8)
AD = (0, -5, -8)

The cross product is determinant:

i    j    k
-4    0   -8
0   -5   -8

Calculating:

i*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)

Simplify:

i*(0 - 40) - j*(32 - 0) + k*(20 - 0)
= (-40)i -32j +20k
So, AC × AD = (-40, -32, 20)

Now, compute AB · (AC × AD):

AB = (-4, -5, 0)
Dot product with (-40, -32, 20) is:

(-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320

So, the scalar triple product is 320. Therefore, the volume V is |320| / 6 = 320/6 = 160/3.

Wait, but wait, the scalar triple product gives the volume as |det| / 6, but wait, AB, AC, AD are vectors from A, so the volume is indeed |AB · (AC × AD)| / 6.

Yes, so volume is 320 / 6 = 160/3.

So, V = 160/3.

Next, I need to compute the areas of each face to get the total surface area S.

Each face is a triangle, so I can compute the area using Heron's formula or using the cross product. Maybe using the cross product is easier since I have coordinates.

Alternatively, since I have the edge lengths, I can compute the area with Heron's formula.

Wait, all faces have the same edge lengths? Let me check.

Wait, the faces are triangles. Each face has three edges. Let me check the edge lengths for each face.

Face ABC: edges AB, BC, AC.

AB = √41, BC = √89, AC = √80.

Face ABD: edges AB, BD, AD.

AB = √41, BD = √80, AD = √89.

Face ACD: edges AC, CD, AD.

AC = √80, CD = √41, AD = √89.

Face BCD: edges BC, CD, BD.

BC = √89, CD = √41, BD = √80.

So, each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89.

Wait, so all four faces are congruent triangles with the same side lengths. That makes things easier because each face has the same area.

So, I can compute the area of one face and multiply by four.

Let me compute the area of triangle ABC with sides √41, √80, √89.

Using Heron's formula: area = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter.

Compute semi-perimeter s:

s = (√41 + √80 + √89) / 2

Hmm, that seems complicated with square roots. Maybe it's better to compute the area using vectors or coordinates.

Alternatively, since I have the coordinates for the points, I can compute the area using the cross product.

Let me choose triangle ABC.

Points:
A = (2, 5/2, 4)
B = (-2, -5/2, 4)
C = (-2, 5/2, -4)

Compute vectors AB and AC.

Wait, AB is from A to B: (-4, -5, 0)
AC is from A to C: (-4, 0, -8)

Compute the cross product AB × AC.

AB = (-4, -5, 0)
AC = (-4, 0, -8)

Cross product AB × AC:

|i     j     k|
|-4    -5     0|
|-4     0    -8|

= i [ (-5)(-8) - 0*0 ] - j [ (-4)(-8) - 0*(-4) ] + k [ (-4)(0) - (-5)(-4) ]

= i [40 - 0] - j [32 - 0] + k [0 - 20]

= 40i -32j -20k

The magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40² + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2)

Compute:

40² = 1600

32² = 1024

20² = 400

Total: 1600 + 1024 + 400 = 3024

So, |AB × AC| = sqrt(3024)

Simplify sqrt(3024). Let's factor 3024.

3024 ÷ 16 = 189. So, 3024 = 16 * 189.

189 = 9 * 21 = 9 * 3 *7. So, 3024 = 16 * 9 * 3 *7 = 16 * 9 *21.

sqrt(3024) = sqrt(16 * 9 *21) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21)

So, the area of triangle ABC is half of that: (12 sqrt(21))/2 = 6 sqrt(21)

Since all four faces are congruent, each has area 6 sqrt(21). Therefore, the total surface area S = 4 *6 sqrt(21) =24 sqrt(21)

Now, the inradius r = 3V / S.

V = 160/3, S=24 sqrt(21)

So,

r = 3*(160/3) / (24 sqrt(21)) ) = (160) / (24 sqrt(21)) = Simplify numerator and denominator:

160 ÷ 8 =20, 24 ÷8=3 => 20/(3 sqrt(21)).

But rationalize the denominator:

20/(3 sqrt(21)) = (20 sqrt(21)) / (3 *21) )= (20 sqrt(21))/63.

So, r = 20√21 /63.

Simplify numerator and denominator: 20 and 63 are coprime? 20 factors are 2²*5, 63 is 7*3². Yes, coprime. Also, 21 is square-free (no square factors).

So, the distance is 20√21 /63.

So, m=20, n=21, p=63.

Wait, but 63 can be simplified with 20? 20 and 63 share no common factors, correct. 20 is 2²*5, 63 is 7*3². So, they are coprime.

Wait, but 63=7*9, which is 7*3². So, n is 21, which factors into 3*7, which is square-free. So, that's correct.

So, m + n + p = 20 +21 +63=104.

Wait, wait, let me recheck the computation for r.

r = 3V / S.

V = 160/3.

3V = 160.

S =24 sqrt(21).

So, r = 160 / (24 sqrt(21)).

Simplify 160 /24: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 20 /3.

So, r = (20 /3) / sqrt(21) = 20/(3 sqrt(21)).

Which is the same as (20 sqrt(21)) / (3 *21) )= 20 sqrt(21)/63.

Yes, correct.

So, m=20, n=21, p=63.

But wait, 20 and 63 are coprime? 20 is 2²*5, 63 is 7*3². No common factors, yes. And n=21 is square-free.

So, m + n + p=20 +21 +63=104.

Wait, but 63 is 7*9, which is 7*3². So, 63 and 20 are coprime, yes.

But just to make sure, is 20√21 /63 the simplest form? Let me check.

Yes, 20 and 63 share no common factors. And 21 is square-free.

So, the answer is 20 +21 +63=104. So, I think the final answer is 104.


To solve the problem, we first recognize that the tetrahedron has equal opposite edges, suggesting symmetry. We assign coordinates to the vertices such that the tetrahedron's symmetry is preserved. Using the given edge lengths, we determine the coordinates of the vertices and compute the volume using the scalar triple product. We then calculate the total surface area by finding the area of one face (using the cross product) and multiplying by four. Finally, we use the formula for the inradius \( r = \frac{3V}{S} \) to find the desired distance.

The inradius is found to be \( \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63} \). Summing the values \( m = 20 \), \( n = 21 \), and \( p = 63 \) gives the final answer.

\boxed{104}
