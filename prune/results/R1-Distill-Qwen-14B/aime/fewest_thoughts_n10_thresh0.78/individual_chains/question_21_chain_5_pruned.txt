Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. A number n is b-eautiful if when written in base b, it has exactly two digits, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. 

Let me start by understanding what it means for a number n to be written as a two-digit number in base b. In base b, a two-digit number is of the form a*b + c, where a and c are the digits. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, right? So a has to be at least 1, and c can be from 0 up to b-1. Also, the value of n is a*b + c.

The condition for b-eautiful is that the sum of the digits, a + c, equals the square root of n. So mathematically, that's a + c = sqrt(n). Since n is a*b + c, we can write this as a + c = sqrt(a*b + c). 

Hmm, let me square both sides to eliminate the square root. That gives (a + c)^2 = a*b + c. Let me expand the left side: a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c. 

Now, I can rearrange the equation: a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0. Hmm, maybe factor this a bit. Let's group terms:

a^2 + (2c - b)*a + (c^2 - c) = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a. So for given values of b and c, we can solve for a. But since a and c are digits in base b, a must be at least 1 and at most b-1, and c must be between 0 and b-1.

Alternatively, maybe I should think of this as an equation to solve for a, given b and c. But since we're dealing with integers, maybe I can find conditions on b, a, and c that satisfy this equation.

Another approach: since a and c are digits, their possible values are limited. Let me think about how to model this.

Let me denote s = a + c, so s = sqrt(n). Then n = s^2. But n is also equal to a*b + c. So, s^2 = a*b + c. But since a + c = s, we can substitute a = s - c. So s^2 = (s - c)*b + c. 

Let me write that out: s^2 = (s - c)*b + c. Hmm, expanding this: s^2 = s*b - c*b + c. Let's rearrange terms: s^2 - s*b + c*b - c = 0. Factor c out of the last two terms: s^2 - s*b + c*(b - 1) = 0.

So, s^2 - s*b + c*(b - 1) = 0. I can solve this for c: c = (s*b - s^2)/(b - 1). 

Wait, because c has to be an integer between 0 and b - 1, the right-hand side must be an integer. So (s*b - s^2) must be divisible by (b - 1). Let's see:

c = [s*(b - s)] / (b - 1).

Hmm, so s*(b - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). That might give us some constraints on s and b.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of this as c = [s*(b - s)]/(b - 1). Since c must be an integer, that fraction must result in an integer.

Let me think about possible values of s. Since a and c are digits, a is at least 1, c is at least 0, so s = a + c is at least 1. Also, since n is a two-digit number in base b, the maximum value of n is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 - 1. So sqrt(n) is at most sqrt(b^2 - 1) which is less than b. So s must be less than b. Because s = sqrt(n) and n < b^2, so s < b.

So s can range from 1 up to b - 1. But also, s = a + c, and since a is at least 1 and c is at least 0, s is at least 1 and at most (b-1) + (b-1) = 2*(b-1). But since s must be less than b, as established earlier, s can be from 1 to b - 1.

Wait, wait, that's not possible. Because if a can be up to b-1 and c can be up to b-1, then a + c can go up to 2b - 2. But n is a two-digit number in base b, so n = a*b + c < b^2. So sqrt(n) < b, which is the same as s < b. So s is from 1 to b-1.

So s can take any integer value from 1 to b-1. For each s, we can try to find integers a and c such that a + c = s and a*b + c = s^2. Let's
