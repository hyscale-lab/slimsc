Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't pass through its center. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6, which I think is called the major radius, and the radius of the generating circle itself is 3, the minor radius.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest inside this sphere and be tangent to it, and it can also rest outside and be tangent. The points of tangency are along circles, and we're supposed to find the radii of these circles when the torus is inside (r_i) and when it's outside (r_o), then find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a reduced fraction m/n, finally giving m + n.

Hmm. Let me think about how a torus and a sphere can be tangent. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus sits inside, touching the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is smaller, so the torus encloses it, touching along another circle.

I remember that for two surfaces to be tangent, their centers must align in a certain way, and the distance between their centers should be equal to the sum or difference of their radii. But wait, in this case, it's a torus and a sphere, not two spheres or two circles, so maybe that's more complex.

Wait, perhaps I should model the torus mathematically. The standard equation for a torus in 3D is (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2, where R is the major radius (distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) and r is the minor radius (radius of the tube). In this case, R would be 6, and r is 3, right? Because when you revolve a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away, the major radius is 6, and minor radius is 3.

So, the equation of the torus is (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 3^2 = 9.

Now, the sphere has radius 11. Let's consider it centered at the origin for simplicity. So the sphere's equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121.

When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the sphere is larger, so the point of tangency is where both surfaces touch. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, so the point of tangency is on the outside.

Wait, no. When the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, it's externally tangent, right? Because the sphere is outside the torus. Or maybe the other way around. Hmm, maybe I should clarify.

Wait, the problem says when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent, and when it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent. So when T is inside S, it's sitting inside, so the sphere is bigger, and the torus is touching the sphere from the inside, so the sphere's surface is outside. Similarly, when T is outside, it's enclosing the sphere, so the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch along a circle.

Wait, but the torus
