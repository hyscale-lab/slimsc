Okay, so I've got this problem about counting the number of paths in an 8x8 grid. The paths start at the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner, with a total length of 16. They need to change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let me try to wrap my head around this.

First, I remember that in a grid, moving from the lower left to upper right corner usually involves moving right and up. For an 8x8 grid, that means moving 7 steps right and 7 steps up, totaling 14 steps. But wait, the problem says the paths are of length 16. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grid size. Wait, an 8x8 grid has 9 points along each side, right? So moving from one corner to the opposite would require 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. Oh, that makes sense now.

So each path is a sequence of 16 moves, 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U). The number of such paths without any restrictions is the binomial coefficient C(16,8), which is 12870. But we're not being asked for all paths; we need those that change direction exactly four times.

Changing direction... let me think. Every time the path changes from R to U or U to R, that's a direction change. So for a path that alternates directions perfectly, it would have many changes, but here we need exactly four changes.

Wait, so starting from the lower left corner, we have to make a certain number of moves in one direction, then switch, and so on, with exactly four switches. Let me consider how the directions can change.

Each time the direction changes, it's a switch from R to U or U to R. So for four direction changes, the path will have five segments. For example, the path might go R for some steps, then U, then R, then U, then R, and so on, with exactly four switches.

Wait, but four switches mean five segments. Each segment is a straight line either to the right or up. So the path is composed of five straight lines, alternating between R and U. Now, the number of R and U segments depends on whether the path starts with R or U.

Let me think about the possibilities. There are two cases:

1. The path starts with R and alternates R, U, R, U, R.
2. The path starts with U and alternates U, R, U, R, U.

Wait, but the total number of direction changes is four, so the number of segments is five. If the path starts with R, then the segments would be R, U, R, U, R. Similarly, if it starts with U, then U, R, U, R, U. So each case has five segments.

Wait, but each segment must consist of at least one step, right? Because you can't have a segment of zero length. So each of the five segments must have at least one step. Since we have a total of 8 R steps and 8 U steps, we can model this
