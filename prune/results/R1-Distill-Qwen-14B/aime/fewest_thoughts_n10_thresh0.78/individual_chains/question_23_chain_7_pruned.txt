Okay, so I've got this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to break it down and figure it out step by step.

The hyperbola is given by the equation \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). So this is a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening horizontally because the positive term is with \( x^2 \). The transverse axis length is \( 2a \), where \( a^2 = 20 \), so \( a = \sqrt{20} \approx 4.472 \). The conjugate axis is \( 2b \), with \( b^2 = 24 \), so \( b = \sqrt{24} \approx 4.899 \).

Now, the problem involves a rhombus ABCD with points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, or they don't? Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect the angles. Wait, no, wait, hold on. I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, maybe I confused it with a kite. Let me think. No, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Because in a rhombus, which is a special case of a parallelogram with all sides equal, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

So, for the rhombus ABCD, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, and they are perpendicular. Since diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

So, let
