Okay, so I came across this math problem, and I want to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem is about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start from the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner. Each path has a length of 16, which makes sense because in an 8x8 grid, moving from one corner to the opposite requires 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps.

The twist is that the path must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay. So, normally, a path on a grid can be represented as a sequence of moves, either right (R) or up (U). Each time the direction changes from R to U or U to R, that counts as a direction change. So, for example, if a path goes R, R, U, U, R, R, U, U, that would change direction twice.

Wait, no, actually, let me think again. If you have a sequence of moves, each time the direction switches, it's a new change. So for example, RRUURRUU has three changes: after the first two Rs, then UU, then RR, then UU. Wait, no, actually, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs. Because each run is a consecutive sequence of the same direction. So if you have three runs, you have two direction changes. So, for example, RRUURRUU has four runs (RR, UU, RR, UU), which means three direction changes. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it differently. Each time the direction changes, it counts as a switch. So starting with the first move, every time you switch from R to U or U to R, that's a change. So for a path that starts with R, each time it switches to U, that's one change, and each time it switches back to R, that's another. So, for example:

- RRRUUU has one change: from R to U.
- RURURU has five changes: R to U, U to R, R to U, U to R, R to U.
Wait, but wait, that can't be right because that would make the number of changes equal to the number of switches. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this as the number of times the direction switches. So, for example, a path that alternates R and U every step would have the maximum number of direction changes, which would be 15 changes for 16 steps. Because each step is a change except the first step.

But in this problem, we're looking for exactly four direction changes. So, the path has to switch direction four times. So, starting from the first direction, each switch adds one to the count. So, how does that translate to the number of runs?

Wait, the number of runs is equal to the number of direction changes plus one. Because each direction change starts a new run. So, if a path has k direction changes, it has k+1 runs.

So, if we have four direction changes, that means there are five runs. So, the path alternates between R and U five times, but that's not possible because each run alternates direction.

Wait, but in an 8x8 grid, the path has to end at the upper right corner, so the number of R steps and U steps must each be 8. So, the path must consist of 8 R's and 8 U's, arranged in some order with exactly four direction changes.

So, let's think about this. Each run is a consecutive sequence of R's or U's. So, with five runs, the path alternates between R and U five times. But the starting direction could be R or U.

Wait, but if you have five runs, you have to alternate direction each time. So, if you start with R, the runs would be R, U, R, U, R. Or if you start with U, it would be U, R, U, R, U. But in either case, you have five runs, which is four direction changes.

But wait, the number of runs has to be even? Or maybe not. Let me see.

Wait, the number of runs can be odd or even, depending on whether the path ends on the same direction it started or not. For example, if you start with R and end with R, you have an odd number of runs (since the last run is R). If you start with R and end with U, then the number of runs is even.

But in our case, since the path must have exactly four direction changes, which implies five runs, so the number of runs is five. So, the starting direction and ending direction must be the same because five is odd. Wait, no: if you have five runs, starting with R, the sequence would be R, U, R, U, R. So, starting and ending with R. Similarly, starting with U, it would be U, R, U, R, U, ending with U. So, yes, for four direction changes (five runs), the path starts and ends on the same direction.

But wait, in our case, the path goes from (0,0) to (8,8). So, the start is (0,0), and the end is (8,8). So, in terms of direction, the first step must be either R or U.

Wait, but regardless, the starting and ending direction can be R or U, but in the case of five runs, starting and ending on the same direction.

So, let's model this.

Each such path with exactly four direction changes must have five runs. Each run alternates direction, starting with either R or U, and ending with the same direction.

Now, the key is that the path must consist of 8 R's and 8 U's, arranged into five runs, with each run being at least length 1.

Wait, because each run must consist of at least one step. So, in each direction, the number of runs must be such that the total steps sum to 8.

Wait, but wait. If the path starts with R, then the R runs would be at positions 1,3,5 in the five runs. So, three R runs and two U runs, because five runs starting and ending with R.

Wait, let me think again. If the path has five runs, starting with R, then the runs would be R, U, R, U, R. So, that's three R runs and two U runs. Each run must have at least one step. So, the total R steps: sum of the three R runs equals 8. Similarly, the total U steps: sum of the two U runs equals 8. Each run is at least 1.

Similarly, if the path starts with U, then the runs would be U, R, U, R, U. So, three U runs and two R runs, each run at least 1, summing to 8 for each.

So, the number of such paths would be the number of ways to partition 8 R's into three runs, each at least 1, times the number of ways to partition 8 U's into two runs, each at least 1, plus the number of ways to partition 8 U's into three runs, each at least 1, times the number of ways to partition 8 R's into two runs, each at least 1.

Wait, because depending on whether the path starts with R or U, the number of R runs and U runs changes.

So, let's formalize this.

Case 1: The path starts with R. Then, the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs. Each run must have at least 1 step.

So, the number of ways to split 8 R's into three runs, each at least 1, is equal to the number of integer solutions to a + b + c = 8, where a, b, c ≥ 1. Similarly, the number of ways to split 8 U's into two runs, each at least 1, is the number of integer solutions to d + e = 8, where d, e ≥ 1.

The number of solutions for R runs: C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.

Similarly, the number of solutions for U runs: C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) =7.

So, for Case 1, the number of paths is 21 * 7 = 147.

Case 2: The path starts with U. Then, the runs are U, R, U, R, U. So, three U runs and two R runs.

Similarly, the number of ways to split 8 U's into three runs: C(7,2) =21.

And the number of ways to split 8 R's into two runs: C(7,1)=7.

So, the number of paths in Case 2 is also 21 *7 =147.

Therefore, the total number of paths is 147 +147=294.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because each path is determined by the lengths of the runs, which are the number of steps in each direction without changing.

So, for a path starting with R, with runs R, U, R, U, R, each run has at least 1 step.

The number of ways to split 8 R's into three runs is the same as the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts, each at least 1. Which is indeed C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21.

Similarly, splitting 8 U's into two runs: C(7,1)=7.

So, 21*7=147 for starting with R.

Similarly, starting with U, it's the same: 21*7=147.

So, total is 294.

But wait, that seems a bit low. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should model it differently.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to model the number of direction changes as the number of times the path switches direction. So, for each path, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the direction switches from R to U or U to R. So, in a path with k direction changes, the number of runs is k+1.

So, for four direction changes, the number of runs is five. So, the path alternates direction five times, which gives five runs. So, whether the path starts with R or U, the number of runs is five, and the first and last runs are the same direction.

Now, the number of ways to arrange the runs would depend on whether the path starts with R or U.

Wait, but the problem is about the number of steps. So, each run must consist of at least one step. So, for a path starting with R, you have runs R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs, each at least 1.

Similarly, the number of ways to distribute 8 R's into three runs is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21. And the number of ways to distribute 8 U's into two runs is C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

So, the number of such paths starting with R is 21 *7=147.

Similarly, starting with U, the runs are U, R, U, R, U, so three U runs and two R runs. The number of ways to distribute 8 U's into three runs is 21, and 8 R's into two runs is 7. So, again 21 *7=147.

Total paths: 147 +147=294.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit concerned because when I think about the total number of paths without any restrictions, it's C(16,8)=12870. So, 294 is a small fraction of that, which makes sense because we're restricting to exactly four direction changes.

But let me see if I can find another way to compute this to verify.

Another approach: The number of paths with exactly k direction changes is equal to the number of compositions of 8 into m parts, where m depends on the direction changes. Wait, perhaps I can model it as a stars and bars problem.

Wait, the number of runs R is equal to the number of direction changes plus one. So, four direction changes give five runs. Each run must have at least one step.

So, if the path starts with R, then the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So, the R runs are three, each at least one, and the U runs are two, each at least one.

So, the number of ways to split 8 R's into three runs: C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21. Similarly, U runs: C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

Multiply them together: 21*7=147.

Same for starting with U: 21*7=147.

Total:294.

So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of it as arranging the runs. So, the number of ways to arrange the runs is 2 (starting with R or U) multiplied by the number of ways to partition the steps.

So, that gives 2 *21 *7=294.

So, that seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should think in terms of combinations with constraints.

Wait, another way: The number of direction changes is four. So, the path has five runs. Each run is either R or U, alternating each time.

So, if the path starts with R, it has runs R, U, R, U, R.

Each R run has at least one step, so the number of R runs is three, and each U run has at least one step, so two U runs.

So, the number of ways to distribute R's is the number of ways to write 8 as a sum of three positive integers: a + b + c =8, a,b,c ≥1. This is C(7,2)=21.

Similarly, the number of ways to distribute U's: d + e =8, d,e ≥1. Which is C(7,1)=7.

So, for starting with R, it's 21 *7=147.

Same for starting with U: 21 *7=147.

Total:294.

Okay, that seems consistent.

Wait, but now I'm a bit confused because in some similar problems, the formula is different. Let me try to recall.

Wait, another approach: The number of paths with exactly k direction changes is equal to 2 * C(n-1, k/2) * C(m-1, k/2) when k is even, but wait, that might not apply here because in our case, k=4, which is even.

Wait, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 2 * C(7,2) * C(7,2), but that seems different.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think differently.

Wait, the number of direction changes is four. So, the path alternates direction four times, leading to five runs.

Each run alternates between R and U.

So, depending on whether the path starts with R or U, the number of R runs and U runs changes.

If it starts with R, then the number of R runs is (5 +1)/2=3, and U runs is 2.

Similarly, starting with U, the number of U runs is 3, and R runs is 2.

So, the number of ways to arrange the R runs is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21.

And the number of ways to arrange the U runs is C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

So, for each starting direction, it's 21 *7=147.

So, total is 294.

Hmm, I think that's correct.

Wait, but let me check with a smaller grid to see if this approach works.

Suppose we have a 2x2 grid, so moving from (0,0) to (2,2). The total number of paths is C(4,2)=6.

Now, let's compute the number of paths that change direction exactly twice.

So, four steps, with exactly two direction changes. So, number of runs is three.

So, starting with R: runs R, U, R.

Number of ways to split R's: 2 R runs, each at least 1. So, 2 R's into two runs: C(1,1)=1 way.

Similarly, U's: 2 U's into one run: C(1,0)=1 way.

So, starting with R: 1*1=1 path.

Similarly, starting with U: runs U, R, U.

Number of ways: U's into two runs: C(1,1)=1.

R's into one run: C(1,0)=1.

So, 1*1=1 path.

Total paths: 1+1=2.

But let's list them.

In a 2x2 grid, the paths that change direction exactly twice would be:

1. RRUU: direction changes once (from R to U), so that's only one change.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, RRUU has one change, R to U.

Wait, but we need exactly two changes.

Wait, let me think. For two changes, the path must switch direction twice.

So, for example:

RURU: changes at step 1 (R to U), step 3 (U to R). Wait, no, RURU is R, U, R, U. So, changes at positions 1, 3, which are two changes.

Wait, but in a 2x2 grid, that's a path of length 4.

Wait, but RURU would have two direction changes: R to U, then U to R, then R to U. So, three changes? Wait, no, because each switch counts as a change. So, from R to U is one change, U to R is another, R to U is a third. So, that's three changes, which is more than two.

Wait, so perhaps in a 2x2 grid, how many paths have exactly two changes?

Let me list all possible paths:

1. RRUU: changes once.
2. RUUR: changes twice (R to U at step 1, U to R at step 3).
3. URRU: changes twice (U to R at step 1, R to U at step 3).
4. UURR: changes once.
5. RURU: changes three times.
6. URUR: changes three times.

Wait, so only two paths have exactly two changes: RUUR and URRU.

So, total of two paths.

Which matches our earlier calculation of 294 for 8x8, but scaled down.

Wait, in the 2x2 case, our formula would give:

Number of runs: three.

Starting with R: number of R runs=2, U runs=1.

Number of ways to split R's: 2 into two runs: C(1,1)=1.

Number of ways to split U's: 2 into one run: C(1,0)=1.

So, 1*1=1 path starting with R.

Similarly, starting with U: U runs=2, R runs=1.

Number of ways: U's into two runs: C(1,1)=1.

R's into one run: C(1,0)=1.

So, 1 path starting with U.

Total: 2 paths. Which matches the actual count.

So, that gives me more confidence that the approach is correct.

Therefore, returning to the original problem, the number of paths is 294.

Wait, but I just want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, so in the 8x8 grid, with four direction changes, leading to five runs.

Each run has at least one step.

If starting with R, three R runs and two U runs.

Number of ways to split 8 R's into three runs: C(7,2)=21.

Number of ways to split 8 U's into two runs: C(7,1)=7.

So, 21*7=147.

Same for starting with U: 21*7=147.

Total: 294.

Yes, that seems correct.

I think that's the answer.


To solve the problem of finding the number of paths on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we start by noting that each path must consist of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, totaling 16 moves. A direction change occurs when the path switches from R to U or U to R.

### Key Observations:
1. **Direction Changes and Runs**: A path with exactly four direction changes has five runs. Each run is a consecutive sequence of the same direction (either R or U).
2. **Starting and Ending Directions**: Since there are five runs (an odd number), the path must start and end with the same direction. Thus, it can either start with R and end with R or start with U and end with U.

### Case Analysis:
- **Case 1: Starting with R**  
  The runs are R, U, R, U, R. This means there are three R runs and two U runs.
  - The number of ways to distribute 8 R's into three runs (each run ≥1) is calculated using combinations: \( \binom{8-1}{3-1} = \binom{7}{2} = 21 \).
  - The number of ways to distribute 8 U's into two runs (each run ≥1) is \( \binom{8-1}{2-1} = \binom{7}{1} = 7 \).
  - Total paths for this case: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

- **Case 2: Starting with U**  
  The runs are U, R, U, R, U. This means there are three U runs and two R runs.
  - The number of ways to distribute 8 U's into three runs is \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \).
  - The number of ways to distribute 8 R's into two runs is \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \).
  - Total paths for this case: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

### Total Paths:
Adding the paths from both cases gives the total number of paths with exactly four direction changes:
\[ 147 + 147 = 294 \]

Thus, the number of such paths is:

\boxed{294}
