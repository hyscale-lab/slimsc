Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, so we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. We're given some side lengths: BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, let me visualize this. Rectangles ABCD and EFGH. Let me draw rectangle ABCD first. So ABCD has sides AB=107 and BC=16. So AB is the longer side. So if I imagine the rectangle, AB is 107 units long, and BC is 16 units. So the rectangle isn't too tall.

Now, EFGH is another rectangle. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. That probably means that E is somewhere on DC extended, right? Because D and C are adjacent in ABCD. So if D, E, C, F are collinear, then E is on the extension of DC beyond C, and F is further along that line. So EF is 184, FG is 17. So EF is much longer than FG, which is the side of rectangle EFGH.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting. So A, D, H, G are concyclic. That must mean that quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. So that gives us some properties to work with.

Let me label the points to clarify:

- Rectangle ABCD: A is connected to B, B to C, C to D, D to A. AB=107, BC=16, so AD=BC=16, DC=AB=107.

- Rectangle EFGH: E is connected to F, F to G, G to H, H to E. FG=17, EF=184, so FG is one side, EF is another. Since it's a rectangle, all angles are right angles.

Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, all sides are at right angles.

Points D, E, C, F collinear. So the line passes through D, E, C, F. So point E is on DC extended beyond C, F is further on that line.

So, DC is 107 units, as DC = AB=107.

Since EF is 184, that's the length from E to F. Since EF is a side of rectangle EFGH, which is a rectangle, so EFGH has sides EF=184 and FG=17.

Wait, but in a rectangle, adjacent sides are of different lengths. So EF=184 is one side, FG=17 is the adjacent side. So the sides of EFGH are 184 and 17.

Now, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

Let me think about how these rectangles are positioned. Since E is on DC extended, and F is on the same line, and G is part of rectangle EFGH. So G is connected to H, which is connected back to E. Hmm.

Let me sketch a rough diagram mentally.

- Rectangle ABCD: Let's say A is at the origin (0,0). Then B is at (107,0), C at (107,16), D at (0,16).

Wait, that's one way to place it. Alternatively, maybe it's better to place D at the origin to make things fit. Let me try that.

Let me place point D at (0,0). Then rectangle ABCD: since AB=107, BC=16. So if D is (0,0), C would be (107,0), B at (107,16), and A at (0,16). So ABCD has points D(0,0), C(107,0), B(107,16), A(0,16).

Now, EFGH is another rectangle. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So the line passes through D(0,0), E, C(107,0), F. So this line is the x-axis.

So E is on the x-axis beyond C, and F is beyond E. So E would be at some point (107 + a, 0), and F would be at (107 + a + b, 0), where a and b are positive lengths. But wait, in the problem, it's given that EF=184 and FG=17.

Wait, but EFGH is a rectangle, so from E, moving to F, then to G, then to H, then back to E.

Since EFGH is a rectangle, angle at F is 90 degrees, so from F, moving up (or down) 17 units to G, then from G, moving left 184 units to H, then from H, moving down (or up) 17 units to E.

Wait, but EF is 184, so EF is the horizontal side, and FG is 17, the vertical side. So from E, moving right 184 units to F, but wait, E is on DC extended, which is the x-axis. Wait, no, if EF is 184, and E is on the x-axis, then F must be either to the right or left of E.

But given that E is beyond C on the x-axis, so E is at (107 + a, 0), so F is at (107 + a + 184, 0), because EF=184. Then FG is 17, so from F, moving upwards 17 units (since it's a rectangle, perpendicular to EF), so G is at (107 + a + 184, 17). Then from G, moving left 184 units (since FG is 17, and HG would be 184) to H, so H is at (107 + a + 184 - 184, 17) = (107 + a, 17). Then from H, moving down 17 units to E, which would be (107 + a, 0). That makes sense.

So, rectangle EFGH has coordinates:

- E: (107 + a, 0)

- F: (107 + a + 184, 0) = (291 + a, 0)

- G: (291 + a, 17)

- H: (107 + a, 17)

Wait, but we know that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Let me note their coordinates.

Point A: (0,16)

Point D: (0,0)

Point H: (107 + a, 17)

Point G: (291 + a, 17)

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. If E is at (107 + a, 0), then F should be at (107 + a + 184, 0), which is (291 + a, 0). Then from F, moving up 17 units to G: (291 + a, 17). Then from G, moving left 184 units to H: (291 + a - 184, 17) = (107 + a, 17). So H is at (107 + a, 17), and then from H, moving down 17 units to E: (107 + a, 0). Correct.

So now, points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(107 + a,17), G(291 + a,17) lie on a circle.

We need to find the length of CE. Point C is at (107,0). Point E is at (107 + a, 0). So CE is the distance between (107,0) and (107 + a,0), which is just |a|. So CE = a.

So if we can find a, then we have CE.

So the key is to find the value of a such that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle.

So let's find the equation of the circle passing through points A, D, H, G. Since four points lie on a circle, the determinant for concyclic points must be zero.

But maybe it's easier to find the equation of the circle passing through A, D, H, and then see if G also lies on it.

Points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(107 + a,17).

Let me find the equation of the circle passing through these three points.

General equation of circle: x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0.

Plugging in D(0,0):

0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 ⇒ c = 0.

So equation becomes x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy = 0.

Plug in A(0,16):

0 + 256 + 0 + 32f = 0 ⇒ 256 + 32f = 0 ⇒ f = -256/32 = -8.

So equation becomes x² + y² + 2gx - 16y = 0.

Now plug in H(107 + a,17):

(107 + a)^2 + (17)^2 + 2g(107 + a) -16(17) = 0.

Let me compute each term:

(107 + a)^2 = 107² + 2*107*a + a² = 11449 + 214a + a².

17^2 = 289.

2g(107 + a) = 214g + 2g a.

16*17 = 272.

So putting it all together:

(11449 + 214a + a²) + 289 + 214g + 2g a - 272 = 0.

Simplify:

11449 + 289 = 11738; 11738 - 272 = 11466.

So equation becomes:

a² + 214a + 214g + 2g a + 11466 = 0.

Wait, maybe better to write:

a² + 214a + 2g a + 214g + 11466 = 0.

Wait, but variables here are a and g? Hmm, perhaps I need to find g in terms of a using this equation.

Wait, but I also have to plug in point G(291 + a,17) into the circle equation, right? Because all four points A, D, H, G lie on the circle.

So let's plug G(291 + a, 17) into the circle equation.

The circle equation is x² + y² + 2g x -16 y = 0.

So plugging in G:

(291 + a)^2 + (17)^2 + 2g(291 + a) -16*(17) = 0.

Compute each term:

(291 + a)^2 = 291² + 2*291*a + a² = 84681 + 582a + a².

17^2 = 289.

2g(291 + a) = 582g + 2g a.

16*17 = 272.

So equation becomes:

84681 + 582a + a² + 289 + 582g + 2g a -272 = 0.

Simplify:

84681 + 289 = 84970; 84970 - 272 = 84698.

So equation is:

a² + 582a + 2g a + 582g + 84698 = 0.

Now, we have two equations from plugging in H and G.

From H:

a² + 214a + 2g a + 214g + 11466 = 0.  [Equation 1]

From G:

a² + 582a + 2g a + 582g + 84698 = 0.  [Equation 2]

Let me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate a² and 2g a.

Equation 2 - Equation 1:

(a² - a²) + (582a - 214a) + (2g a - 2g a) + (582g - 214g) + (84698 - 11466) = 0.

Simplify:

0 + 368a + 0 + 368g + 73232 = 0.

So:

368a + 368g + 73232 = 0.

Divide both sides by 368:

a + g + 73232/368 = 0.

Calculate 73232 ÷ 368:

Let me compute 368 * 200 = 73,600, which is larger than 73,232.

Wait, 368*199 = 368*(200 -1) = 73,600 - 368 = 73,232.

So 73232 ÷ 368 = 199.

So the equation becomes:

a + g + 199 = 0 ⇒ a + g = -199.  [Equation 3]

Now, from Equation 1:

a² + 214a + 2g a + 214g + 11466 = 0.

Let me express g from Equation 3 as g = -199 - a.

Substitute g into Equation 1:

a² + 214a + 2*(-199 - a)*a + 214*(-199 - a) + 11466 = 0.

Let me compute each term:

2*(-199 - a)*a = -2a*(199 + a) = -39
