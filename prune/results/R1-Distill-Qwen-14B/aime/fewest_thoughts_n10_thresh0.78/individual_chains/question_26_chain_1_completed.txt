Okay, so I have this geometry problem to solve. Let me read it again.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. The sides are given: AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. We need to find the length of AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Then, compute m + n.

Hmm. Alright, first, let's visualize the problem. We have triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's not a right-angled triangle because 5² + 9² is 25 + 81 = 106, which isn't equal to 10²=100. Wait, actually, 5² + 9² is 106, which is more than 100, so maybe it's an obtuse triangle? Let me check: Using the cosine law.

Wait, maybe I should compute the circumradius first. Because the tangents at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole or something? Or perhaps D is the ex-similicenter? Hmm.

Wait, tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal. So, DB = DC, since both are tangents from D to ω. So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Also, since AD is a line from A through D, intersecting the circle again at P. So, AP is a chord passing through D.

Hmm, maybe we can use power of a point. The power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DP * DA because AD is a secant line.

Wait, let me clarify: Power of a point D with respect to ω is equal to DB², because DB is the tangent. Also, since AD is a secant, DP * DA = DB². So, DP * DA = DB².

Yes, that makes sense. So, if I can compute DB, then I can find DP in terms of DA, or find DA in terms of DB.

But DA is AD, which is from A to D. So, maybe I can find AD first, and then find DP, and thus find AP = AD - DP? Or wait, is P between A and D? Let me think.

Since P is the intersection of AD with ω again, that would mean that starting from A, going through D, and then intersecting the circle again at P. So, the order is A, then P, then D? Wait, no: If AD intersects ω again at P, then starting from A, the line goes through A, then P is the other intersection, so P is between A and D.

Wait, no, actually, if you have a circle ω, and you draw a line from A through D, which is outside the circle, then the intersections are A (on the circle) and P (the other point). So, the line from A goes through P and then D. So, the order is A, then P, then D. So, AP is the shorter segment from A to P, and PD is from P to D. So, the entire length AD is AP + PD.

But from the power of point D, we have DP * DA = DB². Wait, no: Power of point D with respect to ω is DB², which is equal to DP * DA. Wait, the formula is that for a point outside the circle, the power is equal to the product of the lengths from the point to the two intersection points of any secant line through it. So, for point D, the power is DB² = DP * DA. But since P is between A and D, DA is the entire length from D to A, but in the formula, it's the product of the whole secant segment (DA) and its external part (DP). Wait, no, I think the formula is power = DP * DA, where DP is the distance from D to P, and DA is the distance from D to A. Wait, that can't be, because then DA is longer than DP. Maybe I got it wrong.

Wait, let's recall the power of a point theorem: If a line passes through D and intersects the circle at two points X and Y, then DX * DY = power of D. So, in this case, the line is AD, which intersects ω at A and P. So, the power of D is DA * DP = DB².

Wait, but the order is A and P, with D outside. So, the two intersection points are A and P, so the two segments are DA and DP? Wait, no, the two segments from D are DA and DP? Wait, no, because A is on the circle, and P is another intersection point. So, from D, the distances to the points of intersection are DA (distance from D to A) and DP (distance from D to P). But since P is on the circle, and D is external, the formula is DP * DA = power of D. Wait, no, the power is equal to (distance from D to A) * (distance from D to P). Wait, but A is on the circle, so the power of D is equal to DA * (DA - AP), if P is between A and D.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think carefully.

The power of a point D outside the circle is equal to the product of the lengths from D to the two points where any secant line through D intersects the circle. So, in this case, the secant line is AD, which intersects ω at A and P. So, the power of D is DA * DP. But wait, DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. But since A is on the circle and P is another intersection, the power is equal to DA * DP. But since D is outside, and the line goes through A and P, with A closer to D than P is? Wait, no, if D is the intersection point of the tangents at B and C, then D is outside the circle.

Wait, so the circle is the circumcircle of ABC, and D is outside. The line AD passes through A (on the circle) and then intersects the circle again at P. So, the two points where the secant line AD meets the circle are A and P. Therefore, the power of D is equal to (distance from D to A) * (distance from D to P). But since A is on the circle, DA is the tangent? No, no, DA is a secant. Wait, no, DA is a line from D to A, passing through the circle again at P.

Wait, perhaps it's better to denote the distances: Let’s let DA = x, and DP = y. Then, the power of D is DA * DP = DB².

But actually, if the point D is outside, and the secant passes through D, then the power is equal to the product of the entire secant length from D to the far intersection point and the external part. Wait, no, the formula is:

If a secant from D passes through the circle at X and Y, with X closer to D, then power of D is DX * DY.

In our case, the line AD passes through D, then through P, then through A. So, the two intersection points are P (closer to D) and A (farther from D). Therefore, the power of D is DP * DA.

Wait, but DA is from D to A, which is beyond P. So, the power is DP * DA = DB².

Wait, that seems correct because DA is the entire length from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. So, since P is between D and A, DA = DP + PA. So, we have DP * (DP + PA) = DB².

But PA is the segment we're interested in, which is AP. So, if I can express DP and DA in terms of AP, I can solve for it.

Wait, but how do I compute DB? DB is the length of the tangent from D to ω. So, DB = DC, as both are tangents from D.

But to compute DB, we can use the formula for the length of the tangent from a point to a circle: DB = sqrt(DO² - r²), where O is the center of ω, and r is its radius.

So, perhaps I should first compute the circumradius of triangle ABC, then find the coordinates or positions of D, O, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use coordinate geometry. Let me think.

Given the sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10, can I compute the coordinates of A, B, C, then find the circumcircle, then compute D as the intersection of the tangents at B and C, then find the equation of AD, find its intersection P with ω, then compute AP?

This might be a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.

Let me assign coordinates to the triangle.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0). Let me place point A at (10, 0), since AC=10. Then, point B is somewhere in the plane. We know AB=5 and BC=9. So, let me find the coordinates of B.

So, coordinates:

C: (0, 0)
A: (10, 0)
B: (x, y), which we need to find.

We know that AB=5, so the distance from A (10,0) to B (x,y) is 5:

√[(x-10)^2 + (y)^2] = 5 → (x-10)^2 + y^2 = 25. (1)

And the distance from B (x,y) to C (0,0) is 9:

√[x^2 + y^2] = 9 → x^2 + y^2 = 81. (2)

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

x^2 + y^2 - [(x-10)^2 + y^2] = 81 - 25
x^2 - (x² -20x +100) = 56
x² -x² +20x -100 =56
20x = 156 → x=156/20=39/5=7.8

So, x=7.8, which is 39/5. Now, plug x=39/5 into equation (2) to find y.

x² + y² = 81 → (39/5)^2 + y² = 81

Compute (39/5)^2: 39²=1521, so 1521/25 + y²=81

y² =81 -1521/25 = (2025/25 -1521/25)= 504/25

So, y= ±√(504/25)= ±(√504)/5

Simplify √504: 504=16*31.5, wait, 504=16*31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but that's not helpful. Let me factor 504.

504: divide by 2: 252
Again by 2: 126
Again by 2: 63
63 divided by 3:21
Again by3:7
So, 504=2^3 *3^2 *7.

So, √504=√(2^3 *3^2 *7)= 2^(1.5)*3*√7= 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7)=6*sqrt(14).

Wait, wait: 2^3 is 8, which is 4*2. So sqrt(8)=2*sqrt(2). 3^2 is 9, sqrt(9)=3. So, sqrt(504)=sqrt(8*9*7)=sqrt(8)*sqrt(9)*sqrt(7)=2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7)=6*sqrt(14).

So, y= ±6√14 /5. Let's take y positive, so B is above the x-axis. So, coordinates of B are (39/5, 6√14/5).

So, now we have coordinates:

A: (10,0)
B: (39/5, 6√14/5)
C: (0,0)

Next, find the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC.

To find the circumcircle, we can find the circumradius and the equation of the circle.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates, we can find the circumcircle equation.

The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F =0.

Since points A, B, C lie on this circle.

Plug in C(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +F=0 → F=0.

So equation becomes x² + y² + Dx + Ey =0.

Now, plug in A(10,0): 10² +0² + D*10 + E*0=0 →100 +10D=0 →10D= -100 → D= -10.

So now equation is x² + y² -10x + Ey=0.

Now, plug in point B(39/5,6√14/5):

(39/5)^2 + (6√14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6√14/5)=0

Compute each term:

(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25

(6√14/5)^2= (36*14)/25=504/25

-10*(39/5)= -78

E*(6√14/5)= (6√14 E)/5

So, equation becomes:

1521/25 + 504/25 -78 + (6√14 E)/5 =0

Compute 1521 +504=2025, so 2025/25=81.

So, 81 -78 + (6√14 E)/5=0 →3 + (6√14 E)/5=0 → (6√14 E)/5= -3 → E= (-3 *5)/(6√14)= (-15)/(6√14)= (-5)/(2√14)

Rationalize denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by √14:

E= (-5√14)/(2*14)= (-5√14)/28.

So, E= -5√14 /28.

So, equation of circle ω is x² + y² -10x - (5√14 /28)y =0.

We can write this in standard form by completing the squares.

x² -10x + y² - (5√14/28)y =0.

Complete the square for x:

x² -10x = (x -5)^2 -25.

For y:

y² - (5√14/28)y = [y - (5√14/(2*28))]^2 - [ (5√14/(2*28))^2 ]

Wait, let me compute coefficient for y:

The coefficient is -(5√14)/28, so half of that is -(5√14)/(56), and squaring it gives (25*14)/(56^2).

So, the y term becomes [y - 5√14/56]^2 - (25*14)/(56²).

So, putting it all together:

(x -5)^2 -25 + [y -5√14/56]^2 - (350)/(3136) =0

Simplify:

(x -5)^2 + [y -5√14/56]^2 = 25 + 350/3136.

Compute 25 as 78400/3136, so 78400 +350=78750 →78750/3136.

Simplify 78750/3136:

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 39375/1568.

So, the equation is (x -5)^2 + [y -5√14/56]^2 = 39375/1568.

So, the center O is at (5, 5√14/56) and radius squared is 39375/1568.

Wait, let me compute the radius:

sqrt(39375/1568). Let's see, 39375= 39375= 25*1575=25*25*63= 25*25*9*7= 5^3 *3^2 *7.

Wait, maybe not necessary. Anyway, the center is (5, 5√14/56).

So, O is at (5, 5√14/56).

Now, we need to find the point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.

Hmm, finding D as the intersection of the two tangents. Since we have coordinates for B and C, perhaps we can compute equations of the tangents at B and C, then find their intersection point D.

First, the equation of the tangent at a point on a circle.

Given a circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, the tangent at point (x1, y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r^2.

Alternatively, using the point form, the tangent at (x1,y1) is (x1)(x) + (y1)(y) + ... wait, perhaps it's better to recall that the tangent line is perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact.

So, the slope of the radius from O to B is (yB - yO)/(xB - xO).

Compute slope of OB:

yB = 6√14/5, yO =5√14/56

Difference: 6√14/5 -5√14/56 = compute common denominator, which is 280.

6√14/5 = (6*56√14)/280= 336√14/280

5√14/56= (5*5√14)/280=25√14/280

So, difference is (336√14 -25√14)/280= (311√14)/280.

Similarly, xB=39/5, xO=5.

Difference: 39/5 -5=39/5 -25/5=14/5.

So, slope of OB is (311√14/280)/(14/5)= (311√14/280)*(5/14)= (311√14 *5)/(280*14)= (1555√14)/(3920).

Simplify numerator and denominator by 5: 1555/5=311, 3920/5=784.

Wait, 3920 divided by 5 is 784. So, slope of OB is (311√14)/784.

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe it's easier to compute the equation of the tangent line at B.

Alternatively, since the tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB. So, the slope of OB is m, then the slope of the tangent is -1/m.

Wait, let's compute the slope of OB numerically.

Compute yB - yO = (6√14/5) - (5√14/56) = let's compute this.

Convert to same denominator, which is 280.

6√14/5 = (6√14 *56)/280=336√14/280

5√14/56= (5√14 *5)/280=25√14/280

So, difference is (336√14 -25√14)/280=311√14/280.

Similarly, xB -xO=39/5 -5=39/5 -25/5=14/5.

So, slope of OB is (311√14/280)/(14/5)= (311√14/280)*(5/14)= (311√14 *5)/(280*14)= (1555√14)/(3920).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

1555 and 3920: Let's see if they have a common factor. 1555 ÷5=311, 3920 ÷5=784. So, 311 and 784: 311 is a prime number (I think). 784 is 28²=2^4*7².

So, slope of OB is (311√14)/(784). Therefore, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal: -784/(311√14).

Rationalize denominator: -784/(311√14) * (√14/√14)= -784√14/(311*14)= -56√14/311.

So, the tangent at B has slope m1= -56√14/311.

Similarly, we can compute the tangent at C.

Point C is at (0,0). The radius OC has slope (yC - yO)/(xC - xO)= (0 -5√14/56)/(0 -5)= (-5√14/56)/(-5)= (5√14/56)/5= √14/56.

So, slope of OC is √14/56. Therefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular, so slope m2= -56/√14.

Simplify m2: -56/√14= -56√14/14= -4√14.

So, the tangent at C has slope m2= -4√14.

Now, we have two tangent lines: tangent at B has slope m1= -56√14/311 and passes through B(39/5,6√14/5). Tangent at C has slope m2= -4√14 and passes through C(0,0).

We can write the equations of these two tangents.

Equation of tangent at B:

y - yB = m1 (x - xB )

So,

y - (6√14/5) = (-56√14/311)(x - 39/5)

Equation of tangent at C:

y -0 = m2 (x -0) → y= (-4√14)x

So, now, to find point D, we need to solve these two equations.

Let me write them again:

1. y = (-4√14)x

2. y = (-56√14/311)(x - 39/5) + 6√14/5

Set them equal:

(-4√14)x = (-56√14/311)(x - 39/5) +6√14/5

Let me divide both sides by √14 to simplify:

-4x = (-56/311)(x - 39/5) +6/5

Multiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:

-4x *311 = -56(x -39/5) + (6/5)*311

Compute each term:

Left side: -1244x

Right side: -56x + (56*39)/5 + (6*311)/5

Compute (56*39)/5: 56*39=2184, so 2184/5=436.8

Compute (6*311)/5= 1866/5=373.2

So, right side: -56x +436.8 +373.2= -56x +810

So, equation is:

-1244x = -56x +810

Bring all terms to left:

-1244x +56x -810=0 → -1188x -810=0 → -1188x=810 → x=810/(-1188)= -810/1188.

Simplify fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 18: 810 ÷18=45, 1188 ÷18=66.

So, x= -45/66. Simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 45 ÷3=15, 66 ÷3=22. So, x= -15/22.

Now, substitute x= -15/22 into equation y= -4√14 x:

y= -4√14*(-15/22)= (60√14)/22= (30√14)/11.

So, point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Hmm, that's manageable. Now, we have point D at (-15/22, 30√14/11) and point A at (10,0). We need to find the equation of line AD.

Let me compute the slope of AD first.

Slope m3= (yD - yA)/(xD -xA)= (30√14/11 -0)/( (-15/22) -10 )= (30√14/11)/( (-15/22 -220/22 ))= (30√14/11)/( (-235/22 ))= (30√14/11)*(-22/235)= (-660√14)/(2585).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

660 and 2585: Let's see, 660 ÷5=132, 2585 ÷5=517. 132 and 517: 132 ÷11=12, 517 ÷11=47. So, 660=5*11*12, 2585=5*11*47.

So, m3= (-660√14)/(2585)= (-12√14)/47.

So, slope m3= -12√14 /47.

Equation of AD: using point A(10,0):

y -0 = m3 (x -10) → y= (-12√14/47)(x -10)

Now, we need to find point P, which is the other intersection of AD with ω.

We already know that A is on ω, so to find P, we can solve the equation of AD with the equation of ω.

Equation of ω: x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y=0.

Substitute y from AD's equation into ω's equation.

So, y= (-12√14/47)(x -10).

Let me substitute:

x² + [ (-12√14/47 (x -10) ) ]² -10x - (5√14/28)( -12√14/47 (x -10) )=0.

This looks complicated, but let's compute term by term.

First term: x².

Second term: [ (-12√14/47 (x -10) ) ]²= (144*14)/(47²) (x -10)^2= (2016)/(2209) (x² -20x +100).

Third term: -10x.

Fourth term: -(5√14/28)( -12√14/47 (x -10) )= (5√14 *12√14)/(28*47) (x -10)= (60*14)/(1316) (x -10)= 840/1316 (x -10).

Simplify 840/1316: Divide numerator and denominator by 4: 210/329. 210 and 329: 329 ÷7=47, 210 ÷7=30. So, 210/329=30/47.

So, fourth term simplifies to (30/47)(x -10).

Putting it all together:

x² + (2016/2209)(x² -20x +100) -10x + (30/47)(x -10)=0.

Let me multiply all terms by 2209 to eliminate denominators:

2209x² +2016(x² -20x +100) -10x*2209 +30*47(x -10)=0.

Compute each term:

2209x².

2016x² - 2016*20x +2016*100=2016x² -40320x +201600.

-10x*2209= -22090x.

30*47=1410, so 1410(x -10)=1410x -14100.

Now, sum all terms:

2209x² +2016x² -40320x +201600 -22090x +1410x -14100=0.

Combine like terms:

x² terms: 2209 +2016=4225.

x terms: -40320x -22090x +1410x= (-40320 -22090 +1410)x= (-62410 +1410)x= -61000x.

Constant terms:201600 -14100=187500.

So, equation becomes:

4225x² -61000x +187500=0.

Divide all terms by 25 to simplify:

4225 ÷25=169, 61000 ÷25=2440, 187500 ÷25=7500.

So, equation is 169x² -2440x +7500=0.

Solve for x using quadratic formula:

x = [2440 ±√(2440² -4*169*7500)]/(2*169).

Compute discriminant:

2440²=2440*2440. Let me compute 244²=244*244. 200²=40000, 44²=1936, 2*200*44=17600. So, (200+44)^2=200² +2*200*44 +44²=40000 +17600 +1936=59536. So, 2440²=59536*100=5,953,600.

4*169*7500=4*169*7500=4*169=676; 676*7500=5,070,000.

So, discriminant=5,953,600 -5,070,000=883,600.

√883,600= Let me see: 940²=883,600. Because 900²=810,000, 940²=(900+40)^2=900² +2*900*40 +40²=810,000 +72,000 +1,600=883,600.

So, √883,600=940.

So, x=(2440 ±940)/(2*169)= (2440 ±940)/338.

Compute both possibilities:

First, x=(2440 +940)/338=3380/338=10.

Second, x=(2440 -940)/338=1500/338=750/169≈4.437.

So, x=10 corresponds to point A, so the other intersection is x=750/169.

So, x=750/169, now find y.

From equation of AD: y= (-12√14/47)(x -10).

Substitute x=750/169:

y= (-12√14/47)(750/169 -10)= (-12√14/47)(750/169 -1690/169)= (-12√14/47)(-940/169)= (12√14 *940)/(47*169).

Simplify:

12 and 47: no common factors. 940 and 169: 169 is 13², 940 ÷13=72.307… No, 940 ÷13= 72.307? Wait, 13*72=936, so 940=13*72 +4=13*72 +4, so not divisible by 13. Hmm.

Wait, 940= 940= 4*235=4*5*47. So, 940=4*5*47.

So, 12√14 *940=12*940√14=12*4*5*47√14= (48*5*47)√14= 240*47√14.

Denominator:47*169=47*13².

So, y= (240*47√14)/(47*169)=240√14 /169.

So, point P is at (750/169, 240√14/169).

Now, we need to find AP.

Point A is at (10,0), point P is at (750/169, 240√14/169).

Compute distance AP.

AP=√[(750/169 -10)^2 + (240√14/169 -0)^2].

Compute 750/169 -10=750/169 -1690/169= (750 -1690)/169= (-940)/169.

So, (750/169 -10)= -940/169.

So, (750/169 -10)^2= (940/169)^2= (940)^2/(169)^2.

Similarly, (240√14/169)^2= (240)^2 *14/(169)^2.

So, AP²= [ (940)^2 + (240)^2 *14 ] / (169)^2.

Compute numerator:

940²= (900 +40)^2=900² +2*900*40 +40²=810,000 +72,000 +1,600=883,600.

240²=57,600; 57,600*14=806,400.

So, numerator=883,600 +806,400=1,690,000.

So, AP²=1,690,000/(169)^2.

Simplify:

169²=28561.

1,690,000/28561= (16900^2)/169²= (16900/169)^2= (100)^2=10,000. Wait, no, wait: 1,690,000=169*10,000.

Wait, 1,690,000=1,690 *1000=169*10 *1000=169*10,000.

Wait, 1,690,000= 169 *10,000.

So, 1,690,000/(169)^2= (169*10,000)/ (169*169)=10,000/169.

So, AP²=10,000/169 → AP=√(10,000/169)=100/13.

So, AP=100/13. Therefore, m=100, n=13, which are coprime. So, m +n=113.

Wait, that's the answer. Let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.

So, computing AP:

AP²= [ ( -940/169 )^2 + (240√14/169)^2 ]= (940² +240²*14)/169².

940²=883600.

240²=57600; 57600*14=806400.

883600 +806400=1,690,000.

1,690,000/169²=1,690,000/(28561)= (169*10000)/28561=10000/169. So, AP=100/13.

Yes, that's correct. So, AP=100/13, so m +n=113.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that triangle \(ABC\) has sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\). We need to find the length of \(AP\), where \(P\) is the second intersection point of line \(AD\) with the circumcircle \(\omega\) of \(ABC\), and \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents to \(\omega\) at \(B\) and \(C\).

1. **Coordinates of Points**:
   - Place \(C\) at \((0, 0)\) and \(A\) at \((10, 0)\).
   - Find coordinates of \(B\) using the distances \(AB = 5\) and \(BC = 9\). Solving, \(B\) is at \((\frac{39}{5}, \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5})\).

2. **Circumcircle of \(ABC\)**:
   - The circumcircle's equation is derived as \(x^2 + y^2 - 10x - \frac{5\sqrt{14}}{28}y = 0\).

3. **Finding Point \(D\)**:
   - \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\). Using the equations of these tangents, we find \(D\) at \(\left(-\frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11}\right)\).

4. **Equation of Line \(AD\)**:
   - The slope of \(AD\) is \(-\frac{12\sqrt{14}}{47}\), giving the equation \(y = -\frac{12\sqrt{14}}{47}(x - 10)\).

5. **Finding Point \(P\)**:
   - Solve the intersection of line \(AD\) with the circumcircle. The coordinates of \(P\) are found to be \(\left(\frac{750}{169}, \frac{240\sqrt{14}}{169}\right)\).

6. **Length of \(AP\)**:
   - Using the distance formula, \(AP = \sqrt{\left(\frac{750}{169} - 10\right)^2 + \left(\frac{240\sqrt{14}}{169}\right)^2}\). Simplifying, \(AP = \frac{100}{13}\).

Thus, \(AP = \frac{100}{13}\), and \(m + n = 100 + 13 = 113\).

\(\boxed{113}\)
