Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm. So, first, find the smallest prime p where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² for some n. Then, find the smallest m that satisfies the same condition.

I think I remember that primes p where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p² are related to primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8 or something like that. Wait, let me recall. For primes p, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p can have solutions only under certain conditions.

I remember that for a prime p, the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1. So, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has solutions if and only if the order of -1 divides (p-1)/2, because the multiplicative group has order p-1, and -1 is an element of order 2. So, for x⁴ ≡ -1 to have solutions, 8 should divide p-1. Because the multiplicative group needs to have an element of order 8, which would require that 8 divides p-1.

Wait, but the problem is about modulo p squared, not just modulo p. So maybe it's a bit different.

I think that if p is an odd prime and p ≡ 1 mod 4, then -1 is a quadratic residue mod p. But here, we're dealing with quartic residues. So, for x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², I think the primes p must satisfy certain congruence conditions.

Wait, let me think. Suppose p is a prime such that p ≡ 1 mod 8. Then, since the multiplicative group mod p² is cyclic of order p(p-1). So, to have x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², we need that the order of -1 divides (p(p-1))/gcd(4, something). Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the multiplicative group structure.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p². I believe that for primes p ≡ 1 mod 8, -1 is a quartic residue modulo p, and perhaps it can be lifted to a solution modulo p² using Hensel's lemma.

Wait, another thought: The equation x² ≡ -1 mod p² is solvable only if p ≡ 1 mod 4, because the equation x² ≡ -1 mod p has solutions only if p ≡ 1 mod 4. Similarly, for quartic residues, maybe it's a similar condition but higher. So, for x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², maybe we need p ≡ 1 mod 8.

So, the smallest primes p that are 1 mod 8 are 17, 97, etc. Wait, wait, the primes congruent to 1 mod 8 are 17, 97, 41,  etc. Wait, no, let's list primes in order.

The primes in order are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, etc. So, 17 is the first prime that's 1 mod 8. But wait, 2 is also a prime. Let me think about p=2.

Wait, can p=2 work? Let's see. If p=2, then p²=4. So, we need n⁴ +1 divisible by 4. Let's test n=1: 1 +1=2, which is not divisible by 4. n=2: 16+1=17, not divisible by 4. n=3: 81+1=82, which is 82 mod 4 is 2, so no. n=4: 256 +1=257, 257 mod 4 is 1. Hmm, seems like for p=2, no solution exists because n⁴ is always 0 or 1 mod 4. So, n⁴ +1 is 1 or 2 mod 4. So, never 0 mod 4. So p=2 is out.

Next, p=3. Let me check if there exists n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9. Since 3²=9.

Compute n⁴ mod 9 for n=1 to 8 (since mod 9 has residues 0-8).

n=1: 1 mod 9.

n=2: 16 mod 9 is 7.

n=3: 81 mod 9 is 0.

n=4: 256 mod 9. 256/9 is 28*9=252, 256-252=4. So, 4.

n=5: 625. 625 divided by 9: 9*69=621, 625-621=4. Wait, 5⁴ = 625, which is 4 mod 9.

Wait, 625 mod 9: 6+2+5=13, 1+3=4. So, 4.

n=6: 6⁴=1296, which is 0 mod 9.

n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401 mod 9: Sum digits 2+4+0+1=7. So 7 mod 9.

n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4+0+9+6=19, 1+9=10, 1+0=1. So 1 mod 9.

So, the possible residues for n⁴ mod 9 are 0,1,4,7. So, -1 mod 9 is 8. So, is 8 in the list? No. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9 has no solution. So, p=3 is out.

Next, p=5. Let me check if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25.

First, let's find n⁴ mod 25 for n=1 to 24.

But that's a lot. Maybe a smarter approach.

I know that for primes p, if p ≡ 1 mod 4, then -1 is a quadratic residue, but for quartic residues, it's more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of solving x⁴ ≡ -1 mod 5 first. Then, see if it can be lifted to mod 25.

But first, let's find if there's n with n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 5.

Compute n⁴ mod 5:

n=1:1

n=2:16 mod5=1

n=3:81 mod5=1

n=4:256 mod5=1

So, n⁴ mod5 is always 0 or 1. So, -1 mod5 is 4. So, no solution. So, p=5 is out.

Next, p=7. Let's check if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 49.

First, check mod7: n⁴ ≡ -1 mod7.

Compute n⁴ mod7 for n=1 to 6.

n=1:1

n=2:16 mod7=2

n=3:81 mod7= 81/7=11*7=77, 81-77=4.

n=4:256 mod7. 256/7=36*7=252, 256-252=4. So 4.

n=5:625 mod7. 625 divided by 7: 7*89=623, 625-623=2. So, 2.

n=6:1296 mod7. 1296 divided by 7 is 185*7=1295, 1296-1295=1. So, 1.

So, n⁴ mod7 can be 1,2,4. So, -1 mod7 is 6. Not in the list. Thus, no solution mod7, so no solution mod49. So p=7 is out.

Next, p=11. Let me check if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 121.

First, check mod11. Let's see if x⁴ ≡ -1 mod11 has solutions.

Compute n⁴ mod11 for n=1 to 10.

n=1:1

n=2:16 mod11=5

n=3:81 mod11=4 (since 7*11=77, 81-77=4)

n=4:256 mod11. 256 /11=23*11=253, 256-253=3.

n=5:625 mod11. 625 /11=56*11=616, 625-616=9.

n=6:1296 mod11. 1296 - 117*11=1287, 1296-1287=9.

Wait, that can't be. Let me compute 6^4=1296. 1296 divided by 11: 11*117=1287. 1296-1287=9. So, 9 mod11.

n=7:7^4=2401. 2401 mod11. 11*218=2398, 2401-2398=3. So, 3.

n=8:8^4=4096. 4096 mod11. 11*372=4092, 4096-4092=4. So, 4.

n=9:9^4=6561. 6561 mod11. Let's compute 6561 ÷ 11: 11*596=6556, 6561-6556=5. So, 5.

n=10:10^4=10000. 10000 mod11: 10000 ÷11=909*11=9999, 10000-9999=1. So, 1.

So, the possible residues mod11 are 1,3,4,5,9. So, -1 mod11 is 10. 10 isn't in the list, so no solution mod11, thus no solution mod121. So p=11 is out.

Next prime is 13. Let's check if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 169.

First, check mod13. Let's compute n⁴ mod13.

n=1:1

n=2:16 mod13=3

n=3:81 mod13= 81-6*13=81-78=3

n=4:256 mod13. 13*19=247, 256-247=9.

n=5:625 mod13. 13*48=624, 625-624=1.

n=6:1296 mod13. 13*99=1287, 1296-1287=9.

n=7:2401 mod13. 2401 ÷13: 13*184=2392, 2401-2392=9.

Wait, 7^4=2401. So, 2401-13*184=2401-2392=9.

n=8:4096 mod13. 13*315=4095, 4096-4095=1.

n=9:6561 mod13. 6561 ÷13: 13*504=6552, 6561-6552=9.

n=10:10000 mod13. 10000 ÷13=769*13=9997, 10000-9997=3.

n=11:14641 mod13. Let's compute 11^4=14641.

14641 mod13: 13*1126=14638, 14641-14638=3.

n=12:12^4=20736. 20736 mod13: 13*1595=20735, 20736-20735=1.

So, the residues mod13 are 1,3,9. -1 mod13 is 12. 12 is not in the list, so no solution mod13, hence no solution mod169. So p=13 is out.

Next prime is 17. Let's check if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 17²=289.

First, check mod17. Let's compute n⁴ mod17.

n=1:1

n=2:16 mod17=16

n=3:81 mod17. 17*4=68, 81-68=13.

n=4:256 mod17. 17*15=255, 256-255=1.

n=5:625 mod17. 17*36=612, 625-612=13.

n=6:1296 mod17. Let's compute 1296 ÷17. 17*76=1292, 1296-1292=4.

n=7:2401 mod17. 17*141=2397, 2401-2397=4.

n=8:4096 mod17. 17*241=4097, 4096 is 17*241 -1 → 4096 mod17=16.

n=9:6561 mod17. 6561 ÷17. 17*385=6545, 6561-6545=16.

n=10:10000 mod17. 10000 ÷17=588*17=9996, 10000-9996=4.

n=11:14641 mod17. 14641 ÷17: 17*861=14637, 14641-14637=4.

n=12:20736 mod17. 20736 ÷17: 17*1220=20740, 20736-20740=-4 mod17=13.

n=13:28561 mod17. 28561 ÷17: Let me compute 17*1680=28560, so 28561 mod17=1.

n=14:38416 mod17. 38416 ÷17: 17*2259=38403, 38416-38403=13.

n=15:50625 mod17. 50625 ÷17: 17*2978=50626, so 50625-50626=-1 mod17=16.

n=16:65536 mod17. 65536 ÷17: 17*3855=65535, 65536-65535=1.

So, the quartic residues mod17 are 1,4,13,16.

-1 mod17 is 16. So, 16 is in the list. So, n=2: 2⁴=16≡-1 mod17. So, n=2 is a solution mod17. Now, can we lift this solution to mod17²=289?

Hensel's lemma says that if f(n) ≡0 mod p and f'(n) not ≡0 mod p, then the solution can be lifted uniquely mod p². Here, f(n)=n⁴ +1. f'(n)=4n³.

At n=2 mod17: f(2)=16 +1=17≡0 mod17. f'(2)=4*(8)=32≡15 mod17. 15 is not 0 mod17, so Hensel's lemma applies, so there exists a unique lift of n=2 mod17 to mod17².

So, there exists an m ≡2 mod17 such that m⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

So, p=17 is the smallest prime where n⁴ +1 is divisible by p² for some n. So, p=17 is our p.

Now, we need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by 17²=289.

So, m is the smallest positive integer such that m⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

We know that m ≡2 mod17. So, let me write m=17k +2, where k is an integer. We need to find the smallest k such that (17k +2)^4 ≡-1 mod289.

Let me compute (17k +2)^4 mod289.

First, expand (17k +2)^4:

= (17k)^4 + 4*(17k)^3*2 + 6*(17k)^2*2² + 4*(17k)*2³ + 2^4

= 17^4 k^4 + 4*17^3 k^3 *2 + 6*17² k² *4 + 4*17 k *8 +16.

But 17^2=289, which is 0 mod289. Similarly, 17^3=4913, which is 4913 mod289. Let me compute 4913 divided by 289.

289*17=4913. So, 17^3=289*17≡0 mod289.

Similarly, 17^4=17*17^3=17*0=0 mod289.

So, all terms except the last two will be 0 mod289, because 17^2 is 289, so 17^2 and higher powers are 0 mod289.

So, (17k +2)^4 mod289 = [4*(17k)*8 +16] mod289.

Wait, let me re-express that. The expansion is:

= 0 + 0 + 0 + 4*(17k)*8 +16.

So, compute 4*17k*8. 4*8=32, so 32*17k=544k.

So, (17k +2)^4 ≡544k +16 mod289.

But 544 mod289: 289*1=289, 544-289=255. So, 544k=255k mod289.

So, (17k +2)^4 ≡255k +16 mod289.

We need this ≡-1 mod289, which is 288 mod289.

So:

255k +16 ≡288 mod289

Subtract 16 from both sides:

255k ≡272 mod289.

So, 255k ≡272 mod289.

We can write this as:

255k ≡272 mod289.

We can simplify this equation.

First, note that 255 and 289 share a GCD. Let's compute GCD(255, 289).

289 ÷255=1 with remainder 34.

255 ÷34=7 with remainder 17.

34 ÷17=2 with remainder 0. So, GCD is 17.

So, the equation 255k ≡272 mod289 can be simplified by dividing each term by 17.

255 ÷17=15.

272 ÷17=16.

289 ÷17=17.

So, the equation becomes:

15k ≡16 mod17.

Now, we need to solve 15k ≡16 mod17.

15 mod17 is 15, 16 mod17 is16.

We can write this as 15k ≡16 mod17.

To solve for k, we can find the modular inverse of 15 mod17.

Find x such that 15x ≡1 mod17.

Using the extended Euclidean algorithm:

17 =1*15 +2

15=7*2 +1

2=2*1 +0.

So, backtracking:

1=15 -7*2

But 2=17 -1*15, so substitute:

1=15 -7*(17 -15) =15 -7*17 +7*15=8*15 -7*17.

So, 8*15 ≡1 mod17. So, the inverse of 15 mod17 is8.

Thus, k ≡16 *8 mod17.

16*8=128. 128 mod17: 17*7=119, 128-119=9. So, k≡9 mod17.

So, the smallest positive integer k is9.

Thus, m=17k+2=17*9 +2=153 +2=155.

So, m=155 is the smallest positive integer such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by17²=289.

Wait a second, but I should verify this. Let me compute 155⁴ +1 mod289.

But computing 155⁴ is a bit tedious. Alternatively, we can compute 155 mod289=155.

Let me compute 155² mod289 first.

155²=24025.

24025 ÷289: Let's compute how many times 289 goes into 24025.

289*80=23120.

24025 -23120=905.

905 ÷289: 289*3=867, 905-867=38.

So, 24025 mod289=38.

So, 155² ≡38 mod289.

Now, compute (155²)²=38²=1444.

1444 mod289: 289*4=1156, 1444-1156=288.

So, 38²=1444≡288 mod289.

Thus, 155⁴=(155²)²≡288 mod289.

So, 155⁴ +1≡288 +1=289≡0 mod289. So yes, 155⁴ +1 is divisible by289.

Is there a smaller m than155 that satisfies this condition? Since we used Hensel's lemma, and k=9 is the smallest positive integer solution, m=155 is indeed the smallest.

Wait, but let me check m=2. 2⁴ +1=17, which is 17 mod289, which is not 0. So, no.

How about m=19? Let me compute 19⁴ +1.

19²=361, 361 mod289=72.

72²=5184. 5184 ÷289: 289*17=4913, 5184-4913=271.

271 mod289=271.

So, 19⁴ +1=271 +1=272 mod289. 272 ≠0, so no.

How about m=34? Let's compute 34 mod17=0, so 34≡0 mod17. Then, m=34 would mean m⁴=0 mod17, so m⁴ +1=1 mod17, which can't be 0 mod289. So, 34 is out.

Wait, maybe m=155 is indeed the smallest.

Alternatively, let me check m=17*1 +2=19, which we already saw.

Wait, maybe m=17*2+2=36. Let's compute 36⁴ mod289.

36 mod289=36.

36²=1296. 1296 mod289: 289*4=1156, 1296-1156=140.

36² ≡140 mod289.

Now, 140²=19600. 19600 mod289: Let's compute 289*67=289*(60+7)=17340 +2023=19363. 19600-19363=237.

So, 36⁴≡237 mod289. 237 +1=238 ≠0.

Similarly, m=17*3+2=53.

53 mod289=53.

53²=2809. 2809 ÷289: 289*9=2601, 2809-2601=208.

53²≡208 mod289.

208²=43264. 43264 ÷289: Let's see, 289*149=289*(150-1)=43350 -289=43061. 43264 -43061=203.

So, 53⁴≡203 mod289. 203 +1=204≠0.

m=17*4+2=70.

70 mod289=70.

70²=4900. 4900 ÷289: 289*16=4624, 4900-4624=276.

70²≡276 mod289.

276²=76176. 76176 ÷289.

Compute 289*263=289*(260+3)=289*260 +289*3=75140 +867=759, 759 with some more.

Wait, let me compute 289*263:

Compute 289*200=57,800.

289*60=17,340.

289*3=867.

So, 57,800 +17,340=75,140 +867=76,007.

So, 76,007 is 289*263. Now, 76,176 -76,007=169.

So, 276² ≡169 mod289.

Thus, 70⁴ +1=169 +1=170≠0 mod289.

So, m=70 no good.

Next, m=17*5+2=87.

87²=7569. 7569 mod289: Let's compute 289*26=7514, 7569-7514=55.

So, 87²≡55 mod289.

55²=3025. 3025 mod289: 289*10=2890, 3025-2890=135.

So, 87⁴≡135 mod289. 135 +1=136≠0.

m=17*6 +2=104.

104²=10816. 10816 mod289: 289*37=10693, 10816-10693=123.

104²≡123 mod289.

123²=15129. 15129 mod289: 289*52=15028, 15129-15028=101.

So, 104⁴≡101 mod289. 101+1=102≠0.

m=17*7+2=121.

121²=14641. 14641 mod289: 289*50=14450, 14641-14450=191.

121²≡191 mod289.

191²=36481. 36481 mod289: Let's compute 289*126=36414, 36481-36414=67.

So, 121⁴≡67 mod289. 67+1=68≠0.

m=17*8+2=136.

136²=18496. 18496 mod289.

289*63=289*(60+3)=17340 +867=18207.

18496 -18207=289.

So, 136²≡289≡0 mod289. So, 136²=0 mod289. So, 136⁴=(136²)²≡0²=0 mod289. So, 136⁴ +1=1 mod289≠0.

So, no.

m=17*9 +2=155, which we already saw works.

So, yes, m=155 is the smallest positive integer satisfying the condition.

Wait, but let me check if there's any m less than 155 that satisfies m⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

But since we used Hensel's lemma, and k=9 is the minimal solution for k in the equation, m=155 is the minimal. Because any smaller k would not satisfy the congruence condition.

So, I think 155 is the correct answer.


The problem asks for the least prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) where \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \), and then to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) satisfying the same condition for this \( p \).

First, we determine the smallest prime \( p \). We check primes sequentially:

- For \( p = 2 \), \( n^4 + 1 \) modulo \( 4 \) never yields \( 0 \).
- For \( p = 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 \), we find that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \) has no solutions.
- For \( p = 17 \), we find that \( n = 2 \) satisfies \( 2^4 \equiv -1 \mod 17 \). Using Hensel's lemma, we lift this solution to modulo \( 17^2 = 289 \), confirming that \( p = 17 \) is the smallest such prime.

Next, we find the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 289 \). We use the form \( m = 17k + 2 \) and solve for \( k \) in the congruence \( 255k + 16 \equiv 288 \mod 289 \). Simplifying, we find \( k = 9 \). Thus, \( m = 17 \times 9 + 2 = 155 \).

Verification shows \( 155^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 289 \), confirming \( m = 155 \) is correct.

\boxed{155}
