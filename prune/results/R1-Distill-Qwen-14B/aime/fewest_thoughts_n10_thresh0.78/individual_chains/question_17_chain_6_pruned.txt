Okay, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then find r squared expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, I have to find p+q. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, let's recall that a rectangular box has three dimensions: length (let's say x), width (y), and height (z). The surface area (S) of a rectangular box is given by the formula S = 2(xy + yz + xz). The volume (V) is simply xyz. 

Given that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23, so we have two equations:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54
2. xyz = 23

I can simplify equation 1 by dividing both sides by 2, so:

xy + yz + xz = 27

So, now I have:

xy + yz + xz = 27  ...(A)
xyz = 23          ...(B)

Now, the problem is about finding the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere must enclose the box completely, which means the diameter of the sphere must be equal to the space diagonal of the box. Because the sphere has to touch the farthest corners of the box, the diameter is the length from one corner of the box to the opposite corner, which is the space diagonal.

The space diagonal (d) of a rectangular box can be calculated using the formula:

d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²)

So, the radius (r) of the sphere would be half of that, so:

r = d / 2 = sqrt(x² + y² + z²) / 2

Therefore, r squared would be:

r² = (x² + y² + z²) / 4

So, our goal is to find the minimal possible value of r², which depends on minimizing x² + y² + z², given the constraints on the surface area and volume.

So, I need to minimize x² + y² + z², subject to the constraints:

xy + yz + xz = 27
xyz = 23

This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I remember that in such cases, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but I'm not sure if that's the easiest way here. Alternatively, maybe I can express variables in terms of each other.

Let me see if I can express x² + y² + z² in terms of the known quantities.

I know that (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz). So, if I can find x + y + z, then I can find x² + y² + z².

Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + xz = 27, and Q = xyz = 23.

So, (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz)
So, S² = x² + y² + z² + 2*27
Thus, x² + y² + z² = S² - 54

So, our target is to minimize x² + y² + z², which is equivalent to minimizing S² (since 54 is a constant). Therefore, the minimal x² + y² + z² corresponds to the minimal possible S².

Wait, but I don't know if that's necessarily true. Because S can be anything, but perhaps S is constrained by the other equations.

So, how do I relate S and Q? Hmm, maybe using inequalities or some optimization techniques.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express one variable in terms of others. Let me suppose that we fix one variable, say, express z in terms of x and y.

From equation (B): z = 23 / (xy)

Then, plugging this into equation (A):

xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy)) = 27

Simplify each term:

xy + (23/(x)) + (23/(y)) = 27

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe manageable.

Let me denote u = x, v = y. Then, equation becomes:

uv + 23/u + 23/v = 27

So, uv + 23(1/u + 1/v) = 27

Hmm, perhaps I can let t = u + v and s = uv. Then, 1/u + 1/v = (u + v)/(uv) = t/s.

So substituting:

s + 23*(t/s) = 27

Which gives:

s + (23t)/s = 27

Multiply both sides by s:

s² + 23t = 27s

So, s² -27s +23t =0

But this introduces t, which is u + v. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, maybe use AM >= GM? I don't know if that's directly applicable here, but let's think.

We have three variables x, y, z, with certain constraints. Maybe assuming the box is a cube? But wait, for a cube, x = y = z. Let's check.

If x = y = z, then surface area would be 6x² = 54, so x² = 9, x=3. Then, volume would be 27, but in our case, volume is 23, which is less than 27. Therefore, the box isn't a cube. So, it's a more "squashed" box.

But perhaps the minimal enclosing sphere occurs when the box is as close to a cube as possible, given the constraints.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal space diagonal occurs when the box is a cube, but since our volume is less, the space diagonal would be longer. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers. Let's try that. So, we can set up a function to minimize f(x,y,z) = x² + y² + z², subject to the constraints g(x,y,z) = xy + yz + xz =27 and h(x,y,z)=xyz=23.

So, using Lagrange multipliers, we can set up the system:

∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h

Which gives:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)  ...(1)
2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)  ...(2)
2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)  ...(3)

And the constraints:

xy + yz + xz =27      ...(4)
xyz =23              ...(5)

So, equations (1), (2), (3) are the partial derivatives.

Since all variables are positive (they are dimensions), we can perhaps assume x = y = z? Let's test that.

If x = y = z, then equation (4): 3x²=27 => x²=9 => x=3. Then volume is 27, but in our case, volume is 23, which is less. So, x cannot be equal to y = z. So, the minimal point does not occur at a cube.

Thus, we can't have x=y=z. So, the solution must be with x, y, z not all equal.

Hmm, perhaps two variables are equal. Let's assume x = y, but z is different. Let's see if that's possible.

Let x = y.

Then, equation (4): x² + 2xz =27.

Equation (5): x² z =23.

From equation (5): z =23/(x²)

Plugging into equation (4):

x² + 2x*(23/(x²)) =27

Simplify:

x² + (46)/x =27

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ +46 =27x

Bring all terms to one side:

x³ -27x +46=0

Hmm, trying to find real roots for this cubic equation.

Let me try plugging in x=3: 27 -81 +46= -8 ≠0

x=2:8-54+46= 0. Oh! x=2 is a root.

So, (x -2) is a factor.

Performing polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide x³ -27x +46 by (x-2):

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46
        2   4  -46
      1  2  -23  0

So, the cubic factors as (x-2)(x² +2x -23)=0

Set equal to zero, so x=2 or x² +2x -23=0.

Solving x² +2x -23=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x=(-2 ± sqrt(4 +92))/2 = (-2 ± sqrt(96))/2 = (-2 ±4*sqrt(6))/2 = -1 ±2sqrt(6)

Since x must be positive, x= -1 +2sqrt(6)≈-1+4.898≈3.898

So, possible x=2, or x≈3.898.

So, for x=2, then z=23/(x²)=23/4=5.75

So, with x=y=2, z=5.75, let's check equation (4):

xy + yz + xz =2*2 +2*5.75 +2*5.75=4 +11.5 +11.5=27, which is correct.

So, that's a valid solution.

Similarly, for x≈3.898, z=23/(x²). Let's compute x²: (around (3.898)^2≈15.19), so z≈23/15.19≈1.515

So, another solution with x=y≈3.898, z≈1.515.

So, we have two critical points when x=y.

Now, let's compute x² + y² + z² for both cases.

First case: x=y=2, z=5.75

x² + y² + z² =2² +2² +5.75²=4+4+33.0625=41.0625= 41 + 0.0625= 41 + 1/16= 657/16

So, r²= (657/16)/4=657/64

Second case: x=y≈3.898, z≈1.515

Compute x² + y² + z²= 2*(3.898)^2 + (1.515)^2

Let's compute 3.898^2≈15.19, so 2*15.19≈30.38

1.515^2≈2.295

So total≈30.38 +2.295≈32.675

Which is less than 41.0625, so this suggests that the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when x=y≈3.898, z≈1.515

Wait, but wait, perhaps this is a local minimum? Or maybe not? Because we need to confirm whether this is indeed the minimal.

But since we have only two critical points when assuming x=y, perhaps it's the minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps the true minimal occurs when all variables are different.

But solving for the general case with x,y,z all different is complicated. Maybe it's sufficient to consider the case when two variables are equal, as the minimal would occur there.

But to be thorough, perhaps we can check if this is indeed the minimal.

Alternatively, let's compute S =x + y + z for both cases.

First case: x=y=2, z=5.75

S=2+2+5.75=9.75

x² + y² + z²=41.0625

Second case: x≈3.898, y≈3.898, z≈1.515

S≈3.898 +3.898 +1.515≈9.311

So, S is lower in the second case.

But since x² + y² + z²= S² -54, as we saw earlier.

So, for the first case, S=9.75, so S²=95.0625, so x² + y² + z²=95.0625 -54=41.0625, which matches.

For the second case, S≈9.311, so S²≈86.71, so x² + y² + z²≈86.71-54≈32.71, which is close to our approximate calculation of 32.675.

So, that seems consistent.

But is this the minimal value? Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps when one variable is as small as possible, and the other two are adjusted accordingly.

But perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, as in the case above.

Alternatively, perhaps to find the minimal x² + y² + z², given the constraints, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers without assuming any variables equal.

So, going back to the Lagrange system:

Equations (1), (2), (3):

2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)
2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)
2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)

And the constraints:

xy + yz + xz =27
xyz =23

This system looks quite complicated, but perhaps we can find ratios between the equations.

Let me subtract equation (1) and equation (2):

2x - 2y = λ(y + z - x - z) + μ(yz - xz)
Simplify:

2(x - y) = λ(y - x) + μ(z(y - x))
Factor out (y - x):

2(x - y) = (y - x)(λ + μ z)
Multiply both sides by -1:

2(y - x) = (y - x)(λ + μ z)
If y ≠ x, then we can divide both sides by (y - x):

2 = λ + μ z   ...(6)

Similarly, subtract equation (2) - equation (3):

2y - 2z = λ(x + z - x - y) + μ(xz - xy)
Simplify:

2(y - z) = λ(z - y) + μ(x(z - y))
Factor out (z - y):

2(y - z) = -(y - z)(λ + μ x)
Assuming y ≠ z, divide both sides by (y - z):

2 = - (λ + μ x)
Which gives:

λ + μ x = -2    ...(7)

Similarly, from equation (6), we have:

λ + μ z =2       ...(6)

Subtract equation (7) from equation (6):

(λ + μ z) - (λ + μ x) = 2 - (-2)
μ(z - x) =4
So,

μ = 4/(z - x)     ...(8)

Similarly, let's do another subtraction. Subtract equation (1) - equation (3):

2x - 2z = λ(y + z - x - y) + μ(yz - xy)
Simplify:

2(x - z) = λ(z -x) + μ(z y - x y)
Factor:

2(x - z) = -λ(x - z) + μ y (z - x)
Factor out (x - z):

2(x - z) = (x - z)(-λ - μ y)
Assuming x ≠ z, divide both sides by (x - z):

2 = -λ - μ y
Which gives:

λ + μ y = -2    ...(9)

Now, from equation (6): λ + μ z=2

From equation (7): λ + μ x=-2

From equation (9): λ + μ y=-2

So, equations (6), (7), (9) can be rewritten as:

λ + μ z=2        ...(6)
λ + μ x=-2       ...(7)
λ + μ y=-2       ...(9)

Subtract equation (7) from equation (6):

(λ + μ z) - (λ + μ x)=2 - (-2)
μ(z -x)=4

But from equation (8), μ=4/(z -x). So, substituting:

(4/(z -x))*(z -x)=4=4, which is consistent.

So, now, from equation (7): λ = -2 - μ x

From equation (9): λ = -2 - μ y

Therefore, from equations (7) and (9):

-2 - μ x = -2 - μ y
Which implies:

μ x = μ y

If μ ≠0, then x = y

If μ=0, then from equation (6): λ=2, equation (7): λ= -2, which is a contradiction. So, μ cannot be zero.

Therefore, we must have x = y.

So, from this, we've deduced that x = y.

So, that's consistent with our earlier assumption.

Therefore, the minimal occurs when x = y.

So, now, we can proceed with x = y, as we did earlier.

So, going back, we had x = y.

So, in that case, we have:

From equation (5), z=23/(x²)

From equation (4): x² + 2x z =27

Substituting z:

x² + 2x*(23/(x²))=27

Which simplifies to:

x² + 46/x =27

Multiply by x:

x³ +46=27x

Which is x³ -27x +46=0

We found that x=2 is a root, so factoring out (x-2):

(x-2)(x² +2x -23)=0

So, roots at x=2, and x=(-2 ±sqrt(4 +92))/2= (-2 ±sqrt(96))/2= (-2 ±4*sqrt(6))/2= -1 ±2sqrt(6)

Since x must be positive, x= -1 +2sqrt(6)≈3.898.

So, now, the two possibilities are x=2 and x≈3.898.

We need to check which one gives the minimal x² + y² + z².

As earlier, when x=2, z=5.75, x² + y² + z²=41.0625=657/16

When x= -1 +2sqrt(6), then z=23/(x²)

Compute x²:

x= -1 +2sqrt(6)

x²=1 -4sqrt(6) + (2sqrt(6))²=1 -4sqrt(6) +24=25 -4sqrt(6)

So, z=23/(25 -4sqrt(6))

Rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4sqrt(6)):

z=23*(25 +4sqrt(6))/[(25)^2 - (4sqrt(6))^2]=23*(25 +4sqrt(6))/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4sqrt(6))/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4sqrt(6))/529

Simplify:

529 is 23², so 23/529=1/23.

Thus, z=(25 +4sqrt(6))/23

So, z=25/23 + (4sqrt(6))/23

So, x= -1 +2sqrt(6), y=x, z=(25 +4sqrt(6))/23

Now, compute x² + y² + z².

Since x=y, x² + y²=2x²=2*(25 -4sqrt(6))=50 -8sqrt(6)

Plus z²:

z²=[(25 +4sqrt(6))/23]^2 = (625 + 200sqrt(6) + 16*6)/(23²)= (625 +200sqrt(6)+96)/529=(721 +200sqrt(6))/529

So, x² + y² + z²=50 -8sqrt(6) + (721 +200sqrt(6))/529

Convert 50 to 50*529/529=26450/529

Similarly, -8sqrt(6)= -8sqrt(6)*529/529= -4232sqrt(6)/529

So, adding together:

[26450 -4232sqrt(6) +721 +200sqrt(6)] /529

Compute numerator:

26450 +721=27171

-4232sqrt(6) +200sqrt(6)= (-4032sqrt(6))

So, numerator=27171 -4032sqrt(6)

So, x² + y² + z²=(27171 -4032sqrt(6))/529

Hmm, that's exact, but perhaps we can compute its numerical value.

Compute sqrt(6)≈2.4495

4032*2.4495≈4032*2.4495≈let's compute 4000*2.4495=9798, 32*2.4495≈78.384, so total≈9798+78.384≈9876.384

So, numerator≈27171 -9876.384≈17294.616

Denominator=529

So, x² + y² + z²≈17294.616/529≈32.72

Which is less than 41.0625 from the x=2 case.

Therefore, the minimal x² + y² + z² is (27171 -
