Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

The problem says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC, which is AB · AC.

Hmm, okay. So, triangle ABC has both a circumcenter and an incenter. IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is given as 13, which is the radius of the circumscribed circle. The inradius is 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle.

First, let me recall some properties of triangle centers. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides, and it's the center of the circumscribed circle. The incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors and is the center of the inscribed circle.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, that seems like an important condition. Maybe I can use some coordinate geometry or vector methods to model this, but perhaps there's a more straightforward geometric approach.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius.

Wait, let me check that formula. I think it's OI² = R² - 2Rr. Yeah, that's correct. So plugging in the given values:

OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13

So OI is sqrt(13). Okay, that's a useful piece of information.

Now, we have IA perpendicular to OI. So, the vector IA is perpendicular to the vector OI. Hmm, but maybe instead of vectors, I can think in terms of coordinates or use trigonometric identities.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry by placing the triangle in a coordinate system could help. Let me try that.

Let's place point I at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, O lies somewhere on the plane. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), the vector IA is perpendicular to the vector OI.

Wait, but if I is at (0,0), then vector OI is just the vector from I to O, which is (Ox, Oy). Vector IA is from I to A, which would be the coordinates of A, say (a, b). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product is zero:

(a)(Ox) + (b)(Oy) = 0.

Hmm, maybe that's a bit abstract. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider using coordinate geometry by placing triangle ABC such that point A is at (c, 0), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Since O is the circumradius center, the distance from O to each vertex is 13. So OA = OB = OC = 13.

And I is the inradius center, so the distance from I to each side is 6.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe I can find some relation between the sides of the triangle.

Let me think about the formula for the length of IA. The distance from the inradius to vertex A is given by IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Similarly, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed in terms of the triangle's angles.

Wait, is that correct? Let me recall: The distance from the incenter to vertex A is indeed IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Yes, because in the inradius, the inradius is related to the angles.

Similarly, the distance from the circumradius to vertex A is OA = R = 13.

But we also have OI² = R² - 2Rr, which we found earlier as 13. So OI is sqrt(13).

Hmm, so OI is sqrt(13). Also, IA is
