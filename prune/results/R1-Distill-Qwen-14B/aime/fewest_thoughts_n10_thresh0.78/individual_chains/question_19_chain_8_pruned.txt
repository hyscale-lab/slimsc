Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again:

Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, circumradius 13, and inradius 6. Find AB·AC.

Hmm, okay. I need to find the product of sides AB and AC in triangle ABC. The given information includes the circumradius (R) = 13, inradius (r) = 6, and that IA is perpendicular to OI.

First, let me recall some properties and formulas related to triangle centers and their relations.

The circumradius R is given by the formula R = (a)/(2 sin A) where a is the side opposite angle A. Similarly for other sides.

The inradius r is given by r = (Area)/(s), where s is the semi-perimeter.

But I'm not sure yet how to connect IA perpendicular to OI. Maybe I should draw a diagram. Let me visualize triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. IA is an angle bisector, and OI is the line connecting the incenter and circumcenter.

Wait, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. That seems like a specific condition. Maybe I can use vector geometry or coordinate geometry. But maybe there's a trigonometric relation.

Another thought: There's a formula that relates the distance between incenter and circumradius. I remember that OI² = R(R - 2r). Wait, let me check:

Yes, the formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr. So here, R is 13 and r is 6. So OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13).

Wait, that's interesting. So OI is sqrt(13). And IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle IOA is a right triangle, right-angled at I. So, in triangle IOA, IA is one leg, OI is another leg, and OA is the hypotenuse.

But OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, by Pythagoras:

IA² + OI² = OA²

We know OI² is 13, so IA² + 13 = 13² = 169. Thus, IA² = 169 -13 = 156. So IA is sqrt(156), which simplifies to 2*sqrt(39).

Hmm, okay. So IA is 2√39. Now, IA is the length of the inradius from I to vertex A. Wait, no, IA is the distance from incenter I to vertex A. The inradius is the distance from I to the sides, not to the vertices.

So, what's the formula for the length of IA? Let me recall. The distance from the incenter to a vertex can be given in terms of the triangle's angles and sides.

I think the formula for IA is (r)/(sin(A/2)), where r is the inradius. Let me verify that.

Wait, in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed as IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)). Yes, I remember that. So IA is r divided by sin(A/2).

Given that IA is 2√39 and r is 6, then:

2√39 = 6 / sin(A/2)

So, sin(A/2) = 6 / (2√39) = 3 / √39. Let me rationalize the denominator:

3 / √39 = (3√39)/39 = √39 / 13

So, sin(A/2) = √39 / 13.

Now, I can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1.

So, cos²(A/2) = 1
