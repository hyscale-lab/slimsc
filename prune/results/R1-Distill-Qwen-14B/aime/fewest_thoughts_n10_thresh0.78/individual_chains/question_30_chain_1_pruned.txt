Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to cyclotomic polynomials. Let me see how I can apply that here.

First, let's note that ω^13 = 1, since it's a 13th root of unity. So any exponent of ω can be reduced modulo 13. That might be useful later on.

The expression I have is a product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Since k runs from 0 to 12, each term in the product is associated with a distinct power of ω, right? So each term is a function of ω^k, and as k increases, ω^k cycles through all the 13th roots of unity except ω^0=1, but wait, when k=0, ω^0=1, so the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 - 2 +1 =1. Hmm, interesting. So when k=0, the term is 1. So the entire product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Wait, but maybe I can factor the expression 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} in some way. Let me see. Let's denote x = ω^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x². So that's x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, can this quadratic be factored or have roots that are roots of unity?

Let me find the roots of x² - 2x + 2 = 0. Using the quadratic formula: x = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i] / 2 = 1 ± i. So the roots are 1 + i and 1 - i. These are complex numbers, but not roots of unity, since their magnitude is sqrt(2), which isn't 1. Hmm, so maybe that's a dead end.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the product in terms of polynomials. Since ω is a root of x^13 -1 =0, the minimal polynomial over the rationals is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure yet how that ties into this product.

Wait, the product is over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me consider that as the product of (2 - 2x + x²) where x runs through all the 13th roots of unity. So, if I let f(x) = 2 - 2x + x², then the product I'm seeking is the product of f(x) as x ranges over all 13th roots of unity.

But wait, the product of a polynomial evaluated at all the roots of another polynomial
