Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Alice and Bob token game problem. Let me try to understand it step by step. The game is about removing tokens from a stack. There are n tokens, and Alice goes first. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 make it possible for Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, so Bob wants to win regardless of Alice's moves. That means for those n, Bob can force a win no matter what Alice does. So, these n's would be the losing positions for Alice, meaning Alice is in a bad spot if Bob is playing optimally.

I think this is a classic combinatorial game theory problem. Often, these problems can be solved by figuring out the winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a winning position is one where there's at least one move that forces the opponent into a losing position.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote:

- If a player is faced with n tokens and n is a losing position, then no matter what move the player makes, the opponent can win.
- If n is a winning position, the player can make a move that forces the opponent into a losing position.

So, starting from small n, perhaps I can list down which positions are winning (W) and which are losing (L) for the player whose turn it is.

Let's compute for n from 0 upwards:

n=0: Well, n=0 means the game is over, so the player who just took the last token has won. So, for n=0, the current player can't move. So, I think n=0 is a losing position, but since the game ends when you take the last token, maybe n=1 is the first position.

Wait, actually, when n=0, the previous player has won. So, the current player cannot make a move and loses. So, n=0 is a losing position.

n=1: The current player can take 1 token and win. So, n=1 is a winning position.

n=2: Current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. Wait, but that would mean the current player loses. Or wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, for n=2, the options are to take 1 or 4 tokens. Since 4 is more than 2, you can only take 1. So, you take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent. Then the opponent can take that 1 and win. So, if n=2, the current player takes 1, leaves n=1, opponent takes 1 and wins. So, the current player cannot force a win. So, n=2 is a losing position?

Wait, that doesn't make sense because n=1 is a winning position, so if you can leave the opponent at n=1, which is a winning position, does that mean the current player is in a losing position? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me correct my approach. Let's define the positions more clearly.

For each n, if the current
