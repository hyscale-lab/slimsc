Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

The problem says there are 900 residents in total. Among these, some own a diamond ring, some own a set of golf clubs, some own a garden spade, and everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, so candy hearts are universalâ€”everybody has them. 

The numbers given are:
- 195 own a diamond ring.
- 367 own golf clubs.
- 562 own a garden spade.
- 437 own exactly two of these things (diamond, golf, garden spade, or candy hearts, but wait, candy hearts are universal, so maybe not? Hmm, wait, the problem says "exactly two of these things," and the four things are diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. But since everyone owns candy hearts, owning exactly two things would include the candy hearts as one of the two. So, for example, someone could own a diamond ring and candy hearts but nothing else. 

Wait, but the problem mentions "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So that's the fourth item. So the four items are diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. 

So, the problem is asking for the number of residents who own all four of these things. 

I remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall how that works. The inclusion-exclusion principle is used to calculate the number of elements in a union of multiple sets. But in this case, since we have four sets, it's a bit more complicated. 

Wait, but the question isn't directly asking for the union; it's giving us some information about overlaps. Let me list down the given data:

- Total residents (n) = 900
- Number owning diamond ring (D) = 195
- Number owning golf clubs (G) = 367
- Number owning garden spade (S) = 562
- Number owning exactly two of the four items = 437
- Number owning exactly three of the four items = 234
- Number owning all four items (which we need to find) = ?

Wait, but candy hearts (C) are owned by everyone, so I can think of the four items as D, G, S, and C. Since C is universal, everyone has it, so any combination that includes C is already considered.

But since the problem is stating that each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts, that means the set C has 900 elements. So C is the entire set. 

So, when considering other sets like D, G, S, their intersection with C is themselves, because everyone has C. So if someone owns D, they also own C. Similarly, owning D and G would mean they also own C, so they have all three. 

Wait, but the problem says 437 own
