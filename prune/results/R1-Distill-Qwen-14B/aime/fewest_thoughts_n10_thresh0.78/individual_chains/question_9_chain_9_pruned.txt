Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the value of xy given some logarithmic equations. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, okay. So we have two logarithmic equations here involving x and y. Let me write them down to make it clearer.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Alright, I think I can use logarithm properties to simplify these equations. Let me recall that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So maybe I can apply that here.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Using the power rule, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Applying the same power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now we have two equations:

1) x * log_x(y) = 10.

2) 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Hmm, okay. Now, I remember that log_b(a) and log_a(b) are reciprocals of each other. Specifically, log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So maybe I can use that relationship here.

Let me denote log_x(y) as some variable, say, k. Then, log_y(x) would be 1/k.

So let me do that substitution. Let k = log_x(y). Then log_y(x) = 1/k.

Now, substituting into the equations:

First equation: x * k = 10.

Second equation: 4y * (1/k) = 10.

So now I have:

1) xk = 10.

2) (4y)/k = 10.

Alright, so now I have a system of two equations with two variables, x and y, and k is another variable, but I can probably solve for x and y in terms of k and then find k as well.

From the first equation, x = 10 / k. Let me write that down.

x = 10 / k.

Now, substitute x into the second equation. Wait, but the second equation involves y. Let me write the second equation again: (4y)/k = 10.

Solve for y: y = (10k) / 4 = (5k)/2.

So y = (5k)/2.

So now I have x expressed in terms of k and y expressed in terms of k. But I also know that k is log_x(y). So maybe I can express k in terms of x and y and then substitute the expressions for x and y in terms of k into that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate x and y directly. Let's think about that.

Since k = log_x(y), that implies that x^k = y. Because log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

So x^k = y.

But from earlier, I have y = (5k)/2.

So setting those equal: x^k = (5k)/2.

But x is 10/k. Let me substitute that in:

(10/k)^k = (5k)/2.

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but maybe I can manipulate it.

So (10/k)^k = (5k)/2.

Let me write this as (10^k)/(k^k) = (5k)/2.

Multiply both sides by k^k:

10^k = (5k)/2 * k^k.

Simplify the right side: (5k * k^k)/2 = (5 k^{k+1}) / 2.

So 10^k = (5 k^{k+1}) / 2.

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:

2 * 10^k = 5 k^{k+1}.

Divide both sides by 5:

(2/5) * 10^k = k^{k+1}.

Hmm, this seems tricky. Maybe I can take logarithms on both sides to simplify.

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln( (2/5) * 10^k ) = ln( k^{k+1} ).

Using logarithm properties, ln(ab) = ln a + ln b, and ln(a^b) = b ln a.

So left side: ln(2/5) + ln(10^k) = ln(2/5) + k ln(10).

Right side: (k+1) ln(k).

So putting it together:

ln(2/5) + k ln(10) = (k + 1) ln(k).

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, meaning it's not straightforward to solve algebraically. I might need to find a value of k that satisfies this equation.

But perhaps there's a clever substitution or maybe
