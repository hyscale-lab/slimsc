Okay, so I need to solve this math problem where I have a list of positive integers with some specific properties. Let me try to break down the problem step by step. 

First, the problem states that the sum of the items in the list is 30. That's straightforward. So whatever list I come up with, when I add all the numbers together, it should equal 30.

Next, it mentions that the unique mode of the list is 9. Mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list, and it's unique, meaning no other number appears as many times as 9. So 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list.

Then, the median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself. Hmm, that's interesting. The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If the median is a positive integer not in the list, that means when I arrange the numbers in order, the middle number is something that isn't present in the list.

My goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Let me think about how to approach this. I think I should first consider the properties one by one and see how they constrain the possible lists.

Starting with the mode: since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. Let's denote the number of times 9 appears as m. Then, every other number in the list must appear fewer than m times.

Next, the sum is 30, so if I have several 9s, the other numbers must add up to 30 minus 9 times m. Also, the median being a positive integer not in the list gives me some information about the structure of the list.

I should probably consider the possible lengths of the list. Let me denote the number of elements as n. Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, n must be such that when arranged, the middle element is not present. 

Wait, let's recall that the median depends on whether the number of elements is odd or even. If n is odd, the median is the middle element. If n is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

But in this case, the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, if n is odd, the median is an integer not in the list. If n is even, the median would be the average of two middle numbers, which could be a non-integer, but the problem says the median is a positive integer. So for even n, the average of the two middle numbers must be an integer, which implies they are both even or both odd.

But regardless, the median itself is not in the list. So let's consider both cases.

First, let's think about possible values for n.

Since 9 is the mode, at least two 9s are needed. Because if m=1, then other numbers could have m=1 as well, which would make the mode non-unique. So m must be at least 2.

Let me consider possible values for m, starting with m=2.

Case 1: m=2.

So 9 appears twice. Then, the other numbers must appear at most once. Let's see what the sum would be: 2*9=18. So the remaining sum is 30-18=12, distributed among the other numbers, each appearing at most once.

What's the possible n? Let's think about the median.

If n is odd, let's say n=5. Then the median is the 3rd element. Since the numbers are in order, the third number can't be 9 because 9 appears only twice. Wait, but if the list has 5 numbers, and 9 appears twice, the two 9s would be somewhere in the list.

Wait, let's make a small example. Suppose n=5, and two of them are 9. Then the list could be something like [a, b, 9, c, d], but wait, that's not ordered. Let me arrange them in order. So the list would be sorted: [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5]. The median is x3.

Since 9 is the mode and appears twice, the other elements must be unique. So x1, x2, x4, x5 are all unique and different from each other and from 9.

So x3 cannot be 9, but it's the median. So x3 is a number not in the list. But wait, x3 is part of the list, so that can't be. Wait, no, the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list
