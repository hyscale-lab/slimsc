Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations given are a bit complicated, so I need to break them down step by step.

The first function is y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). The second function is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). So, both functions involve these nested functions f and g, which are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Hmm, these are absolute value functions, so they create V-shaped graphs, but with some transformations.

Let me try to understand f(x) and g(x) first. 

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The outer absolute value makes everything non-negative. Let's see, the inner part is |x| - 1/2. So, the graph of |x| is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Subtracting 1/2 from it shifts the graph down by 1/2, so the vertex is now at (0, -1/2). But since we're taking the absolute value of that, any negative parts will be flipped upwards.

Wait, so | |x| - 1/2 |. Let me consider different cases for x:

1. When |x| >= 1/2, so |x| - 1/2 is non-negative. Then f(x) = |x| - 1/2.
2. When |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) becomes (1/2 - |x|).

So, f(x) is a V-shaped graph that has a "W" shape overall. Wait, no, let me think again. Let's plot f(x):

For x >= 1/2: f(x) = x - 1/2, which is a line with slope 1 starting at (1/2, 0).
For x between 0 and 1/2: f(x) = 1/2 - x, which is a line with slope -1 starting at (0, 1/2) and ending at (1/2, 0).
For x between -1/2 and 0: f(x) = 1/2 - (-x) = 1/2 + x, so slope 1 from (-1/2,0) to (0,1/2).
For x <= -1/2: f(x) = -x -1/2, which is a line with slope -1 starting at (-1/2, 0) going downwards.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Since f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, for negative x, |x| is still positive, so it's the same as for positive x. So f(x) is even, symmetric about the y-axis.

So, when |x| >= 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2. So, for x >= 1/2, f(x) is x - 1/2, and for x <= -1/2, f(x) is -x -1/2.

When |x| < 1/2, |x| is less than 1/2, so |x| - 1/2 is negative. So, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|. So, for 0 <= x < 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - x, and for -1/2 < x < 0, f(x) = 1/2 - (-x) = 1/2 + x.

So, the graph of f(x) is a V shape that starts at (1/2, 0), goes up to (0,1/2), then goes back down to (-1/2,0), and then continues as a
