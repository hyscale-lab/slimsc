Okay, so I've come across this probability problem involving a regular octagon, and I want to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.

The problem states: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. We need to find the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, let's break this down.

First, the octagon is regular, so it has eight sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles equal. Each vertex can be colored red or blue, each with a 50% chance, and each coloring is independent.

We're supposed to find the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was previously red. In other words, after rotation, the set of blue vertices should exactly coincide with the set of red vertices that were originally there.

Wait, actually, let me make sure I understand that correctly. It says all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. So, if we rotate the octagon, every blue vertex must map to a red vertex from the original configuration.

Hmm, so that implies that the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if we can rotate the octagon so that all blue vertices align with red ones, then the blue set is a rotated version of the red set.

Alternatively, maybe the set of blue vertices must be a rotation image of the set of red vertices. So, perhaps the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices, and the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

But wait, no, actually, the number of blue and red vertices could be different, but in this problem, because the octagon has an even number of vertices, maybe? Hmm. Wait, no, the octagon has 8 vertices, which is even. So, if we rotate, the number of blue and red vertices must be the same? Let me think.

Wait, actually, if we color each vertex red or blue independently, the number of blue vertices could be anything from 0 to 8. But for there to exist a rotation that maps blue vertices to red ones, it's necessary that the number of blue vertices equals the number of red vertices, right? Because otherwise, you can't have a bijection between the blue and red vertices.

Wait, so if the number of blue vertices is not equal to the number of red vertices, which is 8 minus the number of blue vertices, then we can't have a rotation that maps blue to red. Because you can't have, say, 3 blue vertices mapping to 5 red vertices. So, the number of blue vertices must be equal to the number of red vertices. So, the number of blue vertices must be
