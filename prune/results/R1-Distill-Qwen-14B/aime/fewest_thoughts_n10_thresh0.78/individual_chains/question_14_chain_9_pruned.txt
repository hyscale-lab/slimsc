Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The condition is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, N is a four-digit number. So it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the greatest such number, so I should start checking from 9999 downwards, but there's a specific condition to satisfy.

The condition is that if any single digit is changed to 1, the number becomes divisible by 7. That means for each digit in N, replacing it with 1 gives a number that's a multiple of 7. So, if N is represented as ABCD (where A, B, C, D are digits), then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, which must be divisible by 7. Similarly, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. All four of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

I need to find N such that all four of these modified numbers are divisible by 7. And N should be the greatest possible four-digit number with this property.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since I want the largest N, I should start from 9999 and go down, checking each number to see if it satisfies the condition. But that might be time-consuming. Maybe I can find a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this mathematically. Let me denote N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits (with a ≠ 0 since it's a four-digit number).

When we change the thousands digit (a) to 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. This must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, changing the hundreds digit (b) to 1 gives 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. This must also be divisible by 7.

Same for changing c and d to 1:

- Changing c: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d
- Changing d: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1

All four of these expressions must be divisible by 7. So, each of them must be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

So, mathematically, we can write:

1) 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2) 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3) 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4) 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

And N itself is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

Hmm, perhaps I can find expressions for each of these modulo 7 and find relationships between a, b, c, d.

First, it's helpful to compute the values of 1000, 100, 10, and 1 modulo 7.

Calculating:

- 1000 ÷ 7: 7*142 = 994, so 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7 (since 1000 - 994 = 6)
- 100 ÷ 7: 7*14 = 98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7
- 10 ÷ 7: 7*1=7, so 10 ≡ 3 mod 7
- 1 ≡ 1 mod 7

So, 1000 ≡ 6, 100 ≡ 2, 10 ≡ 3, 1 ≡ 1 mod 7.

Now, let's rewrite each condition using these congruences.

1) 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
   6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

2) 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
   6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

3) 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
   6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7

4) 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7
   6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So now, the four equations become:

1) 2b + 3c + d ≡ -6 ≡ 1 mod 7
2) 6a + 3c + d ≡ -2 ≡ 5 mod 7
3) 6a + 2b + d ≡ -3 ≡ 4 mod 7
4) 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ -1 ≡ 6 mod 7

So, equation 1: 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7 --> (1)
Equation 2: 6a + 3c + d ≡ 5 mod 7 --> (2)
Equation 3: 6a + 2b + d ≡ 4 mod 7 --> (3)
Equation 4: 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod 7 --> (4)

Hmm, perhaps we can solve these equations step by step.

Let me see if I can express some variables in terms of others.

From equation (1): 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod7 --> d ≡ 1 -2b -3c mod7

Similarly, from equation (2): 6a + 3c + d ≡5 mod7. Substitute d from equation (1):

6a + 3c + (1 -2b -3c) ≡5
Simplify: 6a +3c +1 -2b -3c ≡5 --> 6a -2b +1 ≡5 mod7
So, 6a -2b ≡4 mod7
We can write this as 6a ≡ 2b +4 mod7 --> (a)

From equation (3): 6a +2b + d ≡4 mod7. Again, substitute d from (1):

6a +2b + (1 -2b -3c) ≡4
Simplify: 6a +2b +1 -2b -3c ≡4 --> 6a +1 -3c ≡4 mod7
So, 6a -3c ≡3 mod7 --> (6a -3c) ≡3 mod7
Which can be written as 2a - c ≡1 mod7 (since 6a ≡ 6a mod7; 6 ≡6, 3 ≡3. So, 6a -3c ≡3 mod7. Divide both sides by 3: (6a)/3 - c ≡1 mod7. 6a/3 is 2a, so 2a - c ≡1 mod7. So, (b)

So now, from (a): 6a ≡2b +4 mod7
From (b): 2a - c ≡1 mod7

From equation (4):6a + 2b +3c ≡6 mod7

Let me see if I can express everything in terms of a. Let me try.

From (a): 6a ≡2b +4 mod7 --> (2b ≡6a -4 mod7) --> b ≡ (6a -4)/2 mod7. But dividing by 2 is the same as multiplying by the inverse of 2 mod7, which is 4 since 2*4=8≡1 mod7. So, b ≡4*(6a -4) mod7.

Compute 4*(6a -4) =24a -16. 24 mod7 is 24 - 3*7=24-21=3, and -16 mod7: 16/7=2*7=14, so -16 ≡-16 +21=5 mod7. So, b≡3a +5 mod7.

So, b=3a +5 mod7.

Similarly, from (b): 2a - c ≡1 mod7 --> c=2a -1 mod7.

So, c=2a -1 mod7.

Now, from equation (4):6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

Let me substitute b and c from above.

b=3a +5 mod7
c=2a -1 mod7

So,

6a +2*(3a +5) +3*(2a -1) ≡6 mod7

Compute each term:

2*(3a +5) =6a +10
3*(2a -1)=6a -3

Adding all together:

6a + (6a +10) + (6a -3) = 6a +6a +10 +6a -3 =18a +7

18a mod7: 18 ÷7 is 2*7=14, 18-14=4, so 18a≡4a mod7
7 mod7=0

So, 4a ≡6 mod7

So, 4a ≡6 mod7

We can solve for a: Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod7. 4*2=8≡1 mod7, so inverse is 2.

a≡6*2=12≡5 mod7

So, a≡5 mod7. Since a is a digit (a is from 1 to9), the possible values for a are 5 and 12 (but 12 is invalid, so only a=5.

So, a=5.

Now, we can find b and c.

From b ≡3a +5 mod7. a=5.

3*5=15≡1 mod7 (because 15-14=1). So, 1 +5=6 mod7. So, b≡6 mod7. Since b is a digit (0-9), possible b=6 or b=6+7=13, but 13 is invalid, so b=6.

From c=2a -1 mod7. a=5.

2*5=10≡3 mod7. 3 -1=2 mod7. So, c=2 mod7. So, c=2 or 9 (since 2+7=9). But since c is a digit (0-9), possible values are c=2 or c=9. But let's see which one is correct.

Wait, c=2 or 9? Wait, 2 mod7 is 2, but 2 +7=9. So, possible c=2 or 9.

But we need to see which one satisfies the original conditions.

So, let's sum up what we have so far.

a=5
b=6
c=2 or 9
d is yet to be determined.

From equation (1): 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7

We know b=6, so 2*6=12≡5 mod7.

So, 5 +3c +d ≡1 mod7 --> 3c +d ≡-4≡3 mod7.

So, 3c +d ≡3 mod7.

But c can be 2 or 9.

Case 1: c=2.

Then 3*2=6≡6 mod7. So, 6 +d ≡3 mod7 --> d ≡3 -6 =-3≡4 mod7. So, d=4 or 11, but d is a digit, so d=4.

Case 2: c=9.

3*9=27≡6 mod7 (27-3*7=27-21=6). So, 6 +d ≡3 mod7 --> d≡3 -6 =-3≡4 mod7. So, d=4 or 11. Again, d=4.

So, in both cases, d=4.

So, regardless of c=2 or c=9, d=4.

Therefore, now, we have a=5, b=6, c=2 or9, d=4.

So, possible N is 5 6 2 4 or 5 6 9 4.

Which one is larger? Let's see, 5694 vs 5624. 5694 is larger.

But we have to check whether both numbers satisfy all four conditions. Because perhaps only one of them does.

Wait, let's check both numbers.

First, let's check N=5694.

Check all four conditions:

1) Changing a=5 to 1: 1694. Is 1694 divisible by 7?

Compute 1694 ÷7: 7*242=1694. Yes, exactly, so 1694 is divisible by 7.

2) Changing b=6 to 1: 5194. Check if 5194 is divisible by 7.

Compute 5194 ÷7: 7*742=5194. Yes, exactly.

3) Changing c=9 to 1: 5614. Check divisibility by 7.

5614 ÷7: 7*802=5614. Yes, exactly.

4) Changing d=4 to 1: 5691. Check if 5691 ÷7 is divisible.

5691 ÷7: 7*813=5691. Yes, exactly.

So, all four modified numbers are divisible by 7. So, N=5694 is valid.

Now, check N=5624.

1) Changing a=5 to 1: 1624 ÷7: 7*232=1624. Yes.

2) Changing b=6 to 1: 5124 ÷7: 7*732=5124. Yes.

3) Changing c=2 to1: 5614 ÷7: As before, 7*802=5614. Yes.

4) Changing d=4 to1: 5621 ÷7: Let's compute. 5621 ÷7. 7*803=5621 (since 7*800=5600, 7*3=21, so 5600+21=5621). So yes, divisible by7.

So, N=5624 also satisfies all conditions.

But since we want the greatest four-digit number with this property, between 5694 and 5624, 5694 is larger. So, N=5694.

Wait, but why did c have two possibilities? Because when we solved for c, we had c=2 or 9, but both lead to d=4. So, both numbers are possible, but 5694 is larger.

Is there a larger four-digit number than 5694 that satisfies the condition?

Wait, perhaps I need to check numbers larger than 5694. For
