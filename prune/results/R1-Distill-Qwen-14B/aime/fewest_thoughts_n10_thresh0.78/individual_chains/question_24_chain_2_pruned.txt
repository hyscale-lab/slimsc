Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

The problem says: There's a list of positive integers with three properties. First, the sum of all the numbers in the list is 30. Second, the unique mode is 9. Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself. My goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Alright, let's unpack each property one by one and see how they can help me construct the list.

First, the sum is 30. So whatever numbers are in the list, when I add them up, they should total 30.

Second, the unique mode is 9. Mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. "Unique" means that 9 appears more times than any other number. So 9 must appear at least twice, and more than any other number in the list. So, for example, if another number appears twice, 9 must appear three times, or something like that.

Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is a positive integer and it's not in the list. So the median must be a whole number, but it's not one of the numbers in the list.

Hmm, that's interesting. Let me think about how that can happen.

So first, I need to figure out the possible lengths of the list. Let's denote the number of elements as n. Since the median is involved, the position of the median depends on whether n is odd or even.

If n is odd, the median is the middle number. So for example, if n=5, the median is the 3rd number. If n is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, so for n=6, it's the average of the 3rd and 4th numbers.

But the median is a positive integer not in the list. So let's consider both cases.

Case 1: n is odd. Then the median is the middle number, which is not in the list. Wait, but all the numbers are in the list. If the median is a number not in the list, but in the case of an odd n, the median is actually one of the elements. So that can't be. Because if n is odd, the median is the (n+1)/2 th element, which is in the list. So for the median to not be in the list, n must be even. Because when n is even, the median is the average of two middle numbers, which might not be in the list.

So, n must be even. Therefore, the list has an even number of elements. Let me write that down: n is even.

So next, n must be even, and the median is the average of the (n/2)th and (n/2 +1)th numbers. Since the median is a positive integer, let's say m, that is not in the list.

So, for example, if n=6, the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th numbers. So if the 3rd and 4th numbers are, say, 5 and 7, the median is 6, which isn't in the list.

Wait, but in that case, the median is 6, which is an integer, and it's not in the list. So that fits.

So, for n even, the median could be an integer not in the list if the two middle numbers are equidistant from an integer but not that integer themselves. For example, if the two middle numbers are 5 and 7, their average is 6, which is an integer not in the list.

So, in our problem, the median is a positive integer not in the list, so n must be even, and the two middle numbers must average to that integer, which isn't present in the list.

So, let me think about the possible values for n. Since we're dealing with positive integers, n can't be too small or too large.

Let me also remember that the mode is 9, which appears more times than any other number. So, 9 has to appear at least twice, and more than any other number.

So, let's try to construct such a list.

First, let's note that the sum is 30. So, for a list of n elements, the average is 30/n. But since the median is not in the list, and the median is an integer, the two middle numbers must average to that integer.

Wait, but if n is even, the median is the average of the two middle terms. So, for the median to be an integer, those two middle terms must add up to an even number because median = (a + b)/2, which is an integer. So a + b must be even, so a and b are both even or both odd.

Now, let's think about the constraints:

1. The list must have an even number of elements, n, so n is even.

2. The two middle elements must add up to 2m, where m is the median, which is an integer not in the list.

3. The mode is 9, which appears more times than any other number.

So,
