Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon named ABCDEF. Hmm, equilateral means all sides are equal in length, right? And it's convex, so all the internal angles are less than 180 degrees, and none of the sides bend back on themselves. Also, it says that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Interesting.

The problem then mentions that the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. My goal is to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, okay. So I need to visualize this. Let me try to sketch it out in my mind. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it's probably similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily with all angles equal, just all sides equal and opposite sides parallel.

Wait, but in a regular hexagon, all opposite sides are parallel, right? But this one is just equilateral and convex, so maybe the angles can vary as long as opposite sides are parallel. But maybe the properties of the triangle formed by extensions can help relate the hexagon's side length.

So, I think the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF until they meet. Since AB, CD, and EF are sides of the hexagon with AB and CD and EF being opposite sides, but wait, no, in a hexagon with opposite sides parallel, each pair is opposite. Wait, in a hexagon ABCDEF, AB is opposite to DE, BC opposite to EF, and CD opposite to FA.

Wait, so the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me clarify:

- AB is one side.
- CD is another side, which is opposite to FA.
- EF is opposite to BC.

So when we extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. Each of these extensions must meet at some point, forming a triangle with sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. So, the sides of this triangle are the extensions of AB, CD, and EF.

I think I need to find a relationship between the side length of the hexagon and the sides of this triangle. Maybe similar triangles come into play here.

Let me think about how the hexagon is structured. Since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be seen as a combination of a larger triangle and a smaller triangle, with the hexagon in between. Wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, maybe the hexagon is similar to the triangle but scaled down.

Wait, perhaps I can model the hexagon as a truncated version of the triangle. That is, if you take a triangle and cut off smaller triangles from each corner, you get a hexagon. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, since all opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon is what's called a "zonogon," which is a convex polygon with opposite sides equal and parallel. For a hexagon, it's a zonohexagon. These have properties that might be useful.

I remember that in a zonogon, the sides can be grouped into three pairs of equal and parallel
