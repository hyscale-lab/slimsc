Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. They're drawn such that points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let me first try to visualize the problem. We have two rectangles. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB and BC. Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB is 107 units long, and BC is 16 units. So, if I imagine rectangle ABCD, let's say AB is the base with length 107, and BC is the height with length 16. So, point A is at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. 

Now, the other rectangle is EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, these four points lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. Interesting. 

Given that, I think I should draw a rough sketch to understand the arrangement. Let me note down the sides:

- Rectangle ABCD:
  - AB = 107
  - BC = 16
  So, AD = BC = 16, and DC = AB = 107.

- Rectangle EFGH:
  - FG = 17
  - EF = 184
  So, EF = 184 is one side, FG = 17 is the adjacent side. So, assuming EFGH is a rectangle, then EF and FG are adjacent sides, meaning that EH = FG = 17, and GH = EF = 184.

Wait, no, actually, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, EF = GH and FG = EH. So, if EF = 184, then GH = 184, and FG = 17, so EH = 17.

But I need to figure out the orientation of rectangle EFGH relative to ABCD. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, that line must be DC, but wait, D is a corner of rectangle ABCD. Hmm, maybe the line is another line? Wait, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, that line passes through D and C, which are points on rectangle ABCD. So, the line DC is the line on which points E and F lie? 

Wait, DC is a side of rectangle ABCD, right? Because ABCD is a rectangle, so DC is one of the sides, so DC is 107 units long. So, points E and F are on DC? Or are D, E, C, F points on a straight line that's not necessarily DC? Hmm, the problem says D, E, C, F are
