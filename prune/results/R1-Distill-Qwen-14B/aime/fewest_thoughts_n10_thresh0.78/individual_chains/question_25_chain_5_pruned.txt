Okay, so I've got this problem about the residents of Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, let me list out the information given. There are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's one thing everyone has. Then, 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. 

Additionally, it's mentioned that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four: the diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and the candy hearts. 

Hmm, okay. So, I think this is a problem about sets and their intersections. I remember something about inclusion-exclusion principles from my math classes. Let me recall how that works.

The inclusion-exclusion principle helps calculate the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on. But in this case, we're dealing with four sets: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), garden spades (S), and candy hearts (C). But wait, every resident owns a candy heart, so that's like the universal set here. So, actually, everyone is in set C. 

So, let me rephrase the problem. We have four sets: D, G, S, and C, where C is the set of all residents because everyone owns a candy heart. So, the total number of residents is the union of D, G, S, and C. But since C includes everyone, the union is 900.

But perhaps I should model this with the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets. But wait, since C is everyone, maybe I can approach it differently. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, C has 900 elements. So, that's the universal set. So, all other sets (D, G, S) are subsets of C. 

Now, I need to find the number of people who are in all four sets, which is the same as the intersection of D, G, S, and C. But since C is everyone, it's just the intersection of D, G, and S. Because if someone is in D, G, and S, they are automatically in C.

So, perhaps I can model this with the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets: D, G, S. Because C is the universal set, so the intersections involving C will be the same as the other sets.

Wait, but the problem gives me information about people owning exactly two or exactly three things. Let me parse that.

We have 437 residents who own exactly two of the four things, and 234 who own exactly three. But remember, since C is a thing everyone owns, owning
