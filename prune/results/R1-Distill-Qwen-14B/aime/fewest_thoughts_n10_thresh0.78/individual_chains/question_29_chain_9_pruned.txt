Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again carefully.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, meaning they lie on a straight line. Additionally, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

First, I'll try to visualize the problem. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Similarly, EFGH is also a rectangle. The points D, E, C, F being collinear suggests that maybe these points lie on a straight line that's part of one of the sides of the rectangles, but I'm not sure yet.

Given that A, D, H, G lie on a circle, that must mean that these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. So, ADHG is a cyclic quadrilateral. That should give us some properties to work with, like opposite angles summing to 180 degrees or something related to power of a point.

Let me note down the given lengths:

- BC = 16. Since ABCD is a rectangle, BC is one of the sides. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so AD = BC = 16. Also, AB and CD are the other sides, so AB = 107. That makes CD = AB = 107.

- FG = 17. Since EFGH is a rectangle, FG = EH = 17. EF = 184, so GH = EF = 184.

We need to find CE. So, points C and E are probably on the same line, which is the line where D, E, C, F lie. So, CE is a segment on that line.

Perhaps I should assign coordinates to these points to make it easier. Let's try that.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since ABCD is a rectangle, and AD = 16, AB = 107. So, if D is at (0,0), then A must be either (0,16) or (16,0). Wait, but ABCD is a rectangle, so let's think about the sides.

If ABCD is a rectangle, then sides AB and CD are equal and sides BC and AD are equal. Let's define the rectangle in such a way:

Let me assign coordinates:

- Letâ€™s set D at (0,0).

- Since AD = 16 and AB = 107, if AD is vertical, then A would be at (0,16). Then, since AB is horizontal, B would be at (107,16). Then, point C would be at (107,0). But wait, BC would then be 107 units, but BC is given as 16. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I got the sides mixed up. Let me think again. In rectangle ABCD, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So, AB is adjacent to BC, which is adjacent to CD, which is adjacent to DA. So, AB is length 107, BC is length 16.

If I place D at (0,0), then if AB is horizontal, then A would be at (0,16), B at (107,16), and C at (107,0). Wait, but then BC would be 107 units as well, which contradicts BC=16.

Wait, maybe I should orient the rectangle so that AD is horizontal. Let me try that.

If D is at (0,0), and AD is horizontal with length 16, then A would be at (16,
