Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem is about a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. We are given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

First, I should probably sketch a diagram based on the Asymptote code provided. Visualizing the problem helps. So, we have triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, line AD meets ω again at P.

I remember that the point where the two tangents meet, in this case, D, is called the ex-pole or sometimes the ex-similicenter of the circle with respect to the triangle. Alternatively, I think it's called the symmedian point in some contexts, but maybe I'm mixing up terms.

Wait, no, the symmedian is the reflection of the median over the angle bisector. Hmm, maybe not directly. Alternatively, since D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, it lies on the symmedian. Or perhaps D is the ex-similicenter of the circle with respect to some other circle. Maybe that's a different concept.

But more importantly, tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. So, DB = DC because both are tangents from D to ω. So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Now, the line AD intersects the circumcircle ω again at P. So, point P is the second intersection point of AD with ω. We need to find AP.

I think I can use power of a point from point D with respect to circle ω. The power of D is equal to DB² = DC², since DB and DC are both tangents. Also, since AD passes through P and A, the power of D can be expressed in terms of DA and DP.

Wait, the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC². Also, since AD passes through ω, the power of D is equal to DP * DA. So, we have DB² = DP * DA.

But wait, actually, the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to the square of the tangent length from D, which is DB² (or DC²). And since AD is a secant, the power is also equal to DA * DP. So, yes, DB² = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DA and DP, I can relate them using DB². But I don't know DA or DP yet
