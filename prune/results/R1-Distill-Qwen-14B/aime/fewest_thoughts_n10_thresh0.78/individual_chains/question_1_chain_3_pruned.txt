Okay, so I've got this problem here with three variables x, y, and z, all positive real numbers. They satisfy a system of three logarithmic equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), then express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. 

Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture.

The equations are:
1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite these equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation:
log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
This means 2^(1/2) = x / (y z). So, sqrt(2) = x / (y z). Let me write that as equation (1a):
x = y z sqrt(2)  --> (1a)

Similarly, the second equation:
log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
So, 2^(1/3) = y / (x z). Let me write that as equation (2a):
y = x z * 2^(1/3)  --> (2a)

Third equation:
log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4
Which means 2^(1/4) = z / (x y). Equation (3a):
z = x y * 2^(1/4)  --> (3a)

Now, I have three equations (1a, 2a, 3a) that relate x, y, z. My goal is to find log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2). Let me denote that expression as E for simplicity.

E = log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 log₂ x + 3 log₂ y + 2 log₂ z

But maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of logarithms. Let me define:
Let a = log₂ x
Let b = log₂ y
Let c = log₂ z

So, E = 4a + 3b + 2c

Now, I need to find a, b, c.

Looking back at the three original equations, let's take the logarithm base 2 of both sides of each equation (1a, 2a, 3a) because logarithms can help linearize the multiplicative relationships.

Starting with equation (1a):
x = y z sqrt(2)
Taking log₂ of both sides:
log₂ x = log₂ (y z sqrt(2)) = log₂ y + log₂ z + log₂ sqrt(2)
Which simplifies to:
a = b + c + (1/2)   --> because log₂ sqrt(2) is log₂ 2^(1/2) = 1/2

Similarly, equation (2a):
y = x z * 2^(1/3)
Taking log₂:
log₂ y = log₂ x + log₂ z + log₂ 2^(1/3)
Which simplifies to:
b = a + c + (1/3)

Equation (3a):
z = x y * 2^(1/4)
Taking log₂:
log₂ z = log₂ x + log₂ y + log₂ 2^(1/4)
Which simplifies to:
c = a + b + (1/4)

So now I have a system of three equations with a, b, c:
1. a = b + c + 1/2   --> Equation (1b)
2. b = a + c + 1/3   --> Equation (2b)
3. c = a + b + 1/4   --> Equation (3b)

Hmm, this is a linear system. Let me write them down clearly:

Equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2
Equation (2b): b = a + c + 1/3
Equation (3b): c = a + b + 1/4

I can try to solve for a, b, c using substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution.

From equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2 --> Let's substitute a in equations (2b) and (3b).

Substituting a into equation (2b):
b = (b + c + 1/2) + c + 1/3
Simplify:
b = b + c + 1/2 + c + 1/3
b = b + 2c + 5/6  (since 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6)

Subtract b from both sides:
0 = 2c + 5/6
So, 2c = -5/6
c = -5/12

Wait, c is log₂ z, and since z is a positive real number, c can be negative. That's fine.

Now, from equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2
We can write a = b + (-5/12) + 1/2
Which is a = b - 5/12 + 6/12 = b + 1/12

So, a = b + 1/12 --> Equation (4)

Now, let's substitute a into equation (3b):
c = a + b + 1/4
We know c = -5/12, so:
-5/12 = a + b + 1/4

But from equation (4): a = b + 1/12, substitute into above:
-5/12 = (b + 1/12) + b + 1/4
Simplify:
-5/12 = 2b + 1/12 + 3/12 (since 1/4 is 3/12)
Wait, 1/4 is 3/12, so:

-5/12 = 2b + (1/12 + 3/12) = 2b + 4/12 = 2b + 1/3

So, 2b = -5/12 - 1/3
Convert 1/3 to 4/12:
2b = -5/12 - 4/12 = -9/12 = -3/4
So, b = (-3/4)/2 = -3/8

So, b = -3/8

Now, from equation (4): a = b + 1/12 = (-3/8) + (1/12)
Convert to common denominator, which is 24:
-3/8 = -9/24
1/12 = 2/24
So, a = (-9/24) + (2/24) = (-7)/24

So, a = -7/24

Now, a = log₂ x = -7/24
b = log₂ y = -3/8
c = log₂ z = -5/12

Now, we need to compute E = 4a + 3b + 2c

Let me compute each term:

4a = 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6

3b = 3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8

2c = 2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6

Now, adding them together:

E = (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

Let me find a common denominator. The denominators are 6, 8. The least common multiple is 24.

Convert each fraction:

-7/6 = (-28)/24
-9/8 = (-27)/24
-5/6 = (-20)/24

Adding them:

(-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify: -75 and 24 can both be divided by 3.

-75 ÷3 = -25
24 ÷3 = 8

So, E = (-25)/8

But the problem asks for the absolute value of E, so |E| = 25/8

25 and 8 are coprime since 25 is 5² and 8 is 2³, sharing no common factors besides 1.

So, m =25, n=8. Therefore, m + n = 25 +8=33.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, checking the substitution into equation (2b):

From equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2

Substituting into equation (2b): b = a + c +1/3
Which becomes: b = (b + c +1/2) + c +1/3
Simplify: b = b + 2c +5/6
Subtract b: 0=2c +5/6
So, c= -5/(12). That seems correct.

Then equation (3b): c =a + b +1/4

Substituting a =b +1/12 and c=-5/12:

-5/12 = (b +1/12) + b +1/4

Which is: -5/12 = 2b + (1/12 +3/12) =2b +4/12=2b +1/3

So, 2b = -5/12 -4/12= -9/12= -3/4
Thus, b= -3/8. Correct.

Then a= b +1/12= -3/8 +1/12= converting to 24ths
