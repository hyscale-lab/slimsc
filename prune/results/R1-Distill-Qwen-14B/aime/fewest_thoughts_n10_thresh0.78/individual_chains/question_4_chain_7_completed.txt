Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, starting with Alice. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me think. This sounds like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I remember something about winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. So, I need to figure out for which n Bob can be in a losing position on his first move, which would mean that Alice is in a winning position. Wait, no, actually, since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position, then Bob can win. Wait, no, maybe I have that backwards.

Wait, let me clarify. If n is a winning position, the first player (Alice) can force a win. If n is a losing position, the first player can't force a win, regardless of how she plays, as long as Bob plays optimally. So, in this case, the question is asking for how many n ≤ 2024 where Bob has a winning strategy, which would be when n is a losing position for Alice. So, I need to find the number of losing positions n where Alice can't force a win, meaning Bob can.

So, the key is to determine for each n whether it's a winning or losing position. To do that, I can model this recursively. For a given n, if there's a move (either subtracting 1 or 4) that leads to a losing position for the opponent, then n is a winning position. If all possible moves lead to winning positions for the opponent, then n is a losing position.

Let me start by calculating the positions for small n and see if I can find a pattern.

Let's define:
- P(n) = True if the position is a winning position.
- P(n) = False if it's a losing position.

Base cases:
- P(0): If there are 0 tokens, the game is over. So, the player who is supposed to move loses. But in this problem, the person who takes the last token wins. So, if n=0, it's an invalid position since no tokens are left. So, perhaps P(0) is a losing position because the player can't make a move. Wait, let me think again. If it's your turn and there are no tokens, you lose. So, P(0) = False (losing position).

Now, for n=1:
- The player can take 1 token, leaving 0 for the opponent, which is a losing position. So, P(1) = True.

n=2:
- The player can take 1, leaving n=1 (which is a winning position for the opponent). Or take 4, which isn't possible since n=2 <4. So, the only move is to n=1, which is a winning position for opponent. So, all moves lead to opponent's win, so P(2) = False.

n=3:
- Take 1, leaving n=2 (losing for opponent). So, P(3)=True.

n=4:
- Take 1, leaving n=3 (winning for opponent) or take 4, leaving n=0 (losing for opponent). So, since taking 4 leaves opponent with P(0)=False, which is a losing position, so P(4)=True.

n=5:
- Take 1, leaving n=4 (P= True) or take 4, leaving n=1 (P=True). So, all moves lead to opponent's winning positions. Therefore, P(5)=False.

n=6:
- Take 1, leaving n=5 (P=False). So, n=6 is a winning position because you can leave opponent in a losing position. So, P(6)=True.

n=7:
- Take 1, leaving n=6 (P=True) or take 4, leaving n=3 (P=True). So, both moves lead to opponent's win. So, P(7)=False.

n=8:
- Take 1, leaving n=7 (P=False). So, P(8)=True.

n=9:
- Take 1, leaving n=8 (P=True) or take 4, leaving n=5 (P=False). So, since taking 4 leads to opponent's losing position, P(9)=True.

Wait, that's not right. Wait, n=9: taking 4 tokens leaves n=5, which is a losing position for the opponent. So, P(9) is a winning position because you can force the opponent into a losing position. So, P(9)=True.

n=10:
- Take 1, leaving n=9 (P=True) or take 4, leaving n=6 (P=True). So, both moves lead to opponent's win. So, P(10)=False.

n=11:
- Take 1, leaving n=10 (P=False). So, P(11)=True.

n=12:
- Take 1, leaving n=11 (P=True) or take 4, leaving n=8 (P=True). So, P(12)=False? Wait, no, if all moves lead to opponent's win, then P(12)=False. But wait, wait, taking 4 from 12 leaves n=8, which is a winning position for opponent. Taking 1 leaves n=11, which is a winning position for opponent. So, yes, P(12)=False.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me list out the P(n) I have so far:

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

P(n): F T F T T F T F T T F T F

Wait, let's make this more precise. Let me write it step by step:

n=0: F

n=1: Can take 1 to n=0 (F). So P(1)=T.

n=2: Can only take 1 to n=1 (T). So P(2)=F.

n=3: Take 1 to n=2 (F). So P(3)=T.

n=4: Can take 1 to n=3 (T) or 4 to n=0 (F). So P(4)=T.

n=5: Take 1 to n=4 (T) or 4 to n=1 (T). So P(5)=F.

n=6: Take 1 to n=5 (F). So P(6)=T.

n=7: Take 1 to n=6 (T) or 4 to n=3 (T). So P(7)=F.

n=8: Take 1 to n=7 (F). So P(8)=T.

n=9: Take 1 to n=8 (T) or 4 to n=5 (F). So P(9)=T.

n=10: Take 1 to n=9 (T) or 4 to n=6 (T). So P(10)=F.

n=11: Take 1 to n=10 (F). So P(11)=T.

n=12: Take 1 to n=11 (T) or 4 to n=8 (T). So P(12)=F.

Hmm, looking at this, the losing positions (F) are at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,...

Wait, let me list the losing positions up to n=12:

n=0: losing

n=2: losing

n=5: losing

n=7: losing

n=10: losing

n=12: losing

Wait, what's the pattern here? Let's see the differences between consecutive losing positions:

From 0 to 2: +2

2 to 5: +3

5 to 7: +2

7 to 10: +3

10 to 12: +2

Hmm, so it's alternating adding 2 and 3. So the losing positions are 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, etc.

Wait, let me check n=13:

n=13:

Take 1 to n=12 (F). So, P(13)=T.

n=14:

Take 1 to n=13 (T) or 4 to n=10 (F). So, taking 4 leaves opponent in losing position. So, P(14)=T.

n=15:

Take 1 to n=14 (T) or 4 to n=11 (T). So, all moves lead to opponent's win. So, P(15)=F.

Yes, so n=15 is a losing position.

So, the losing positions seem to be every 2 and 3 alternately. Let's see if we can find a formula for the losing positions.

Looking at the losing positions:

0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, 25, 27,...

Hmm, perhaps they can be represented in terms of modulo arithmetic. Let's see.

Looking at the numbers:

0 mod 5: 0

2 mod 5: 2

5 mod5:0

7 mod5:2

10 mod5:0

12 mod5:2

15 mod5:0

17 mod5:2

20 mod5:0

22 mod5:2

25 mod5:0

27 mod5:2

So, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, let me check.

0: 0 mod5=0 → losing.

2: 2 mod5=2 → losing.

5: 5 mod5=0 → losing.

7:7 mod5=2 → losing.

10:10 mod5=0 → losing.

12:12 mod5=2 → losing.

15:15 mod5=0 → losing.

17:17 mod5=2 → losing.

20:20 mod5=0 → losing.

Yes, so it seems that all numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5 are losing positions. So, for n ≥0, if n ≡0 or 2 mod5, then P(n)=False (losing positions).

But wait, let's verify with n=1 and n=3.

n=1: 1 mod5=1 → P(1)=True (winning). Correct.

n=3:3 mod5=3 → P(3)=T. Correct.

n=4:4 mod5=4 → P(4)=T. Correct.

n=6:6 mod5=1 → P(6)=T. Correct.

n=8:8 mod5=3 → P(8)=T. Correct.

n=9:9 mod5=4 → P(9)=T. Correct.

n=11:11 mod5=1 → P(11)=T. Correct.

n=13:13 mod5=3 → P(13)=T. Correct.

n=14:14 mod5=4 → P(14)=T. Correct.

n=16:16 mod5=1 → P(16)=T. Correct.

n=18:18 mod5=3 → P(18)=T. Correct.

Yes, seems consistent.

So, the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5. So, for Bob to have a winning strategy, Alice must start on a losing position, meaning n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, no. Wait, if n is a losing position, then the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. So, if Alice is faced with a losing position, she cannot win, which means Bob can win.

Wait, but in the game, the players alternate starting with Alice. So, the first player is Alice. So, if n is a losing position, Alice is in a losing position, so Bob can win. So, the values of n where Bob can win are exactly the losing positions, which are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, now, the question is: how many positive integers n ≤2024 are congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.

So, we need to calculate the number of n in [1, 2024] where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Let's compute this.

First, find how many numbers ≤2024 are ≡0 mod5.

That's floor(2024/5) = 404.8, but floor(2024/5)=404, since 404*5=2020. So, 404 numbers ≡0 mod5.

But wait, 2024/5 is 404.8, so 404 full multiples of 5: 5,10,...,2020. So, 404 numbers.

Similarly, numbers ≡2 mod5: starting from 2,7,12,..., up to the largest ≤2024.

What's the largest number ≤2024 that is ≡2 mod5?

Compute 2024 divided by5: 2024 =5*404 +4. So, 2024 mod5=4. So, the largest number less than or equal to 2024 that is ≡2 mod5 is 2024 - (4-2) =2024-2=2022. Because 2024 mod5=4, so subtract 2 to get to 2022, which is 2 mod5.

So, the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.

The number of terms in this sequence is: Let's use the formula for arithmetic sequences.

First term a=2, common difference d=5, last term l=2022.

Number of terms n is given by:

l = a + (n-1)*d

2022 = 2 + (n-1)*5

2022 -2 = (n-1)*5

2020 =5(n-1)

n-1=404

n=405.

So, 405 numbers ≡2 mod5.

So, the total number of losing positions is 404 (for ≡0) +405 (for ≡2) =809.

Wait, hold on. But n starts from 1. So, n=0 is not counted because the problem says positive integers. So, in the ≡0 mod5, the numbers are 5,10,...,2020: that's 404 numbers.

But wait, n=0 is excluded because the problem is about positive integers. So, the count for ≡0 mod5 is 404.

Similarly, ≡2 mod5: the first number is 2, which is allowed. The last is 2022, as above. So, 405 numbers.

So total is 404+405=809.

But wait, let me double-check.

For ≡0 mod5, numbers from 5 to 2020, inclusive: number of terms is (2020 -5)/5 +1= (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.

For ≡2 mod5, numbers from 2 to 2022 inclusive: (2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.

So total is 404 +405=809.

So, the number of n≤2024 where Bob can force a win is 809.

Wait, but let me confirm that with the initial calculation.

Wait, n=0 is excluded. So, the losing positions are n=2,5,7,10,12,...,2022,2020.

So, in the range 1-2024, the losing positions are n≡0 or 2 mod5, except n=0. So, for 0 mod5, starting from 5 up to 2020: that's 404 numbers.

For 2 mod5, starting from 2 up to 2022: 405 numbers.

Total is 404+405=809.

So, the answer is 809.

Wait, but I should double-check whether the pattern indeed holds for higher numbers beyond n=15.

Let me compute P(16):

n=16: Take 1 to n=15 (F), so P(16)=T.

n=17: Take 1 to 16 (T) or 4 to 13 (T). So, all moves lead to winning positions. So, P(17)=F.

Wait, n=17: 17 mod5=2 → according to our earlier pattern, it should be a losing position. Yes, P(17)=F. Correct.

n=18: Take 1 to 17 (F). So, P(18)=T.

n=19: Take 1 to 18 (T) or 4 to 15 (F). So, P(19)=T.

n=20: Take 1 to 19 (T) or 4 to 16 (T). So, P(20)=F.

Yes, n=20 is a losing position, 20 mod5=0.

So, the pattern continues.

Another test: n=22.

22 mod5=2. So, should be losing.

n=22: Take 1 to 21 (T) or 4 to 18 (T). So, all moves lead to opponent's win. So, P(22)=F. Correct.

n=23: Take 1 to 22 (F). So, P(23)=T.

n=24: Take 1 to 23 (T) or 4 to 20 (F). So, P(24)=T.

n=25: Take 1 to 24 (T) or 4 to 21 (T). So, P(25)=F.

Yes, n=25, which is 0 mod5, is losing.

So, the pattern holds.

Therefore, the number of n≤2024 where Bob can force a win is 809.


To determine the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game using combinatorial game theory. The key is identifying the losing positions, where the current player cannot force a win regardless of the opponent's moves.

We define a position \( n \) as a losing position if every possible move (removing 1 or 4 tokens) leads to a winning position for the opponent. Through recursive analysis, we find that the losing positions are those where \( n \equiv 0 \) or \( 2 \pmod{5} \).

To count the number of such positions up to 2024:
1. **Numbers \( \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \):** These are 5, 10, ..., 2020. There are \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor = 404 \) such numbers.
2. **Numbers \( \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \):** These are 2, 7, ..., 2022. Using the arithmetic sequence formula, there are \( \frac{2022 - 2}{5} + 1 = 405 \) such numbers.

Adding these, the total number of losing positions is \( 404 + 405 = 809 \).

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) where Bob can guarantee a win is:

\[
\boxed{809}
\]
