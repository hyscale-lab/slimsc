Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are defined as y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.

First, I need to understand what f and g are. They're defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. So both are functions that take the absolute value of x, subtract either 1/2 or 1/4, and then take the absolute value again. These are V-shaped functions, right? Because absolute value functions create V-shapes.

Let me sketch f(x) and g(x) in my mind. For f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, the inner |x| creates a V with the vertex at (0,0). Subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2, so the vertex is at (0, -1/2). But then taking the absolute value of that would flip the part below the x-axis up. So f(x) would have a V shape with vertices at (0,0) and (1/2,0), I think. Wait, no, maybe I should think more carefully.

Let me plot f(x):

1. Start with |x|, which is a V with vertex at (0,0).
2. Subtract 1/2: |x| - 1/2. This shifts the graph down by 1/2. So the vertex is now at (0, -1/2). But the graph is still V-shaped, but it intersects the x-axis where |x| - 1/2 = 0, which is at x = 1/2 and x = -1/2. So between -1/2 and 1/2, the graph is below the x-axis, and outside, it's above.
3. Now, take the absolute value of that: ||x| - 1/2|. So wherever |x| - 1/2 was negative (between -1/2 and 1/2), it becomes positive. So the graph between -1/2 and 1/2 is flipped up.

So the graph of f(x) has V-shapes at x = -1/2 and x = 1/2, both at y=0, and it peaks at x=0 where f(0) = |-1/2| = 1/2. So f(x) reaches a maximum of 1/2 at x=0 and has a V-shape going down to 0 at x=±1/2.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let me do the same analysis.

1. Start with |x|, vertex at (0,0).
2. Subtract 1/4: |x| - 1/4, vertex at (0, -1/4). It crosses the x-axis at x = ±1/4.
3. Take absolute value: ||x| - 1/4|. So between -1/4 and 1/4, the graph is flipped up, reaching a maximum at x=0 of 1/4.

So g(x) has a peak at x=0 of 1/4 and V-shapes at x=±1/4.

Now, let's consider the functions y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). These are compositions of functions, so it's going to be a bit involved.

First, let's analyze f(sin(2πx)). The sin function oscillates between -1 and 1. So sin(2πx) has a period of 1, right? Because the period of sin(kx) is 2π/k, so here k=2π, so period is 1.

Similarly, cos(3πy) has a period of 2/(3π) * π? Wait, no, wait. Let's see, cos(ky) has period 2π/k. So for cos(3πy), the period is 2π/(3π) = 2/3. So it's a cosine wave that repeats every 2/3 units in y.

But in our case, for the second equation, x is defined in terms of g(f(cos(3πy))), which is inside another function, so the behavior might be more complex.

But let me step back. Maybe I should figure out the range of f(sin(2πx)) and then g of that.

First, let's compute f(sin(2πx)):

f(t) where t = sin(2πx). Since sin varies between -1 and 1, t is in [-1,1].

So f(t) = ||t| - 1/2|.

Compute f(t):

- For |t| in [0, 1/2], f(t) = | |t| - 1/2 | = 1/2 - |t|, because |t| < 1/2.
- For |t| in [1/2,1], f(t) = | |t| -1/2 | = |t| - 1/2.

So f(t) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Because when |t|=0, f(t)=1/2; when |t|=1/2, f(t)=0; and when |t|=1, f(t)=1 -1/2=1/2.

So f(t) is a function that goes from 1/2 at t=0, down to 0 at t=±1/2, and back up to 1/2 at t=±1.

So f(sin(2πx)) will have the same shape, but with a period determined by sin(2πx), which is 1.

Then, g of that: g(f(t)) = ||f(t) - 1/4|.

Since f(t) is between 0 and 1/2, let's see what g(f(t)) is.

g(s) = ||s| - 1/4|. Since s is non-negative (as it's an absolute value), s ∈ [0,1/2].

So, g(s) = |s - 1/4|.

So for s in [0,1/4], g(s) = (1/4 - s). For s in [1/4, 1/2], g(s) = (s - 1/4).

So g(s) ranges from 0 (at s=1/4) up to 1/4 (at s=0 and s=1/2).

But since s = f(t), which goes from 0 to 1/2, the maximum of g(s) is 1/4, and the minimum is 0.

So, putting it all together, 4*g(f(t)) = 4*( |f(t) - 1/4| ), but wait, no: g(f(t)) is |f(t) - 1/4|, so 4*g(f(t)) is 4 times that.

Wait, no, let me clarify:

g(s) = | |s| - 1/4 |, which, since s is non-negative, is |s - 1/4|.

So 4*g(s) is 4* |s - 1/4|.

So, 4*g(f(t)) will be 4* |f(t) - 1/4|.

Wait, no, because s = f(t), which is in [0,1/2]. So when s is in [0, 1/4], g(s) = 1/4 - s. So 4*g(s) = 4*(1/4 - s) = 1 -4s. When s is in [1/4, 1/2], g(s) = s -1/4, so 4*g(s) = 4*(s -1/4) =4s -1.

So for 4*g(f(t)):

- When f(t) is in [0, 1/4], 4g(f(t)) = 1 -4f(t).
- When f(t) is in [1/4,1/2], 4g(f(t)) =4f(t) -1.

But f(t) is ||t| -1/2|, and t is sin(2πx). So let's see the behavior of f(t).

f(t) = ||t| - 1/2|. So when t is between -1/2 and 1/2, |t| is less than or equal to 1/2, so f(t) = 1/2 - |t|.

When |t| is between 1/2 and 1, f(t) = |t| - 1/2.

So, 4*g(f(t)) is 4*|f(t) -1/4|.

So, if f(t) is in [0,1/4], then 4g(f(t)) = 1 -4f(t). If f(t) is in [1/4,1/2], then 4g(f(t)) =4f(t) -1.

So, substituting f(t):

Case 1: When f(t) ≤ 1/4 → 1 -4f(t)
Case 2: When f(t) ≥1/4 →4f(t) -1

But f(t) = ||t| -1/2|. Let's see when f(t) ≤1/4 and when f(t) ≥1/4.

f(t) ≤1/4:
||t| -1/2| ≤1/4 → -1/4 ≤ |t| -1/2 ≤1/4 → 1/2 -1/4 ≤ |t| ≤1/2 +1/4 → 1/4 ≤ |t| ≤ 3/4.

So when |t| is between 1/4 and 3/4, f(t) is ≤1/4.

And when |t| is ≤1/4 or |t| ≥3/4, f(t) is ≥1/4.

Wait, hold on:

Wait, solving ||t| -1/2| ≤1/4:

This is equivalent to 1/2 -1/4 ≤ |t| ≤1/2 +1/4 → 1/4 ≤ |t| ≤ 3/4.

So yes, when |t| is between 1/4 and 3/4, f(t) is ≤1/4.

Otherwise, when |t| is ≤1/4 or ≥3/4, f(t) is ≥1/4.

So 4g(f(t)) would be:

- For |t| in [1/4, 3/4]: 1 -4f(t)
- For |t| in [0,1/4] or [|t| in [3/4,1]]:4f(t) -1

Now, let's express 4g(f(t)) in terms of t.

Let me compute 4g(f(t)) for each case.

Case 1: |t| ∈ [1/4, 3/4]

f(t) = 1/2 - |t|

So 4g(f(t)) = 1 -4*(1/2 - |t|) = 1 -2 +4|t| = (4|t| -1)

Case 2: |t| ∈ [0,1/4] or [|t| ∈ [3/4,1]]

When |t| ≤1/4:

f(t) = 1/2 - |t|

So 4g(f(t)) =4*(1/2 - |t|) -1 = 2 -4|t| -1 =1 -4|t|

Wait, no:

Wait, when |t| ≤1/4, f(t) =1/2 - |t|, which is ≥1/4 because |t| ≤1/4 → 1/2 -1/4=1/4. So f(t) =1/2 - |t| ≥1/4.

So 4g(f(t)) =4*(f(t) -1/4) =4*(1/2 - |t| -1/4) =4*(1/4 - |t|) =1 -4|t|

Similarly, when |t| ≥3/4:

f(t) = |t| -1/2

So 4g(f(t)) =4*( f(t) -1/4 ) =4*( |t| -1/2 -1/4 )=4*(|t| - 3/4 )=4|t| -3

But wait, wait. When |t| ≥3/4
