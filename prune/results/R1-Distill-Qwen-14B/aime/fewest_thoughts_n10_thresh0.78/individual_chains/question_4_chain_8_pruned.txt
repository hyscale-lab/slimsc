Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, meaning no matter how Alice plays, Bob can always win.

Hmm, I think this is a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember similar problems where you determine winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite—no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, for this problem, we can model the positions (n) as either winning (W) or losing (L). The key is to find all the losing positions because if n is a losing position, then Bob can win when the starting position is n. But wait, since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position, Bob will be able to force a win. So we're looking for the number of losing positions ≤2024.

Let me think about how to determine which positions are losing. Let's start by listing the positions from n=0 upwards and mark them as W or L.

n=0: Well, the game would have already ended, so this is a losing position because the player can't make a move. So, n=0 is L.

n=1: The current player can take 1 token and win. So, W.

n=2: Take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Wait, no: if I take 1, opponent is left with 1, and they can take it and win. So that's bad. Alternatively, I can take 4, but n=2, so I can't take 4. So, if I can't make a move that leaves the opponent in a losing position, then n=2 is L? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, for n=2, the player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent. If n=1 is a W (as we said earlier), then the opponent can win. So, if I take 1, opponent can win. Alternatively, I can't take 4, so the only move is to take 1. Hence, n=2 is a losing position because whatever I do, the opponent can win. So, n=2 is L.

n=3: Let's see. I can take 1, leaving n=2, which is L. So if I leave the opponent at L, then I can force them to lose, meaning n=3 is W.

n=4: I can take 4 and win. So, W.

n=5: I can take 1, leaving n=4, which is W. Or take 4, leaving n=1, which is W. Wait, does that matter? Because if I leave the opponent at a W position, they can win. So, if all my possible moves lead to opponent's W position, then n=5 is L. So, let's see:

From n=5, taking 1 leaves n=4 (W), taking 4 leaves n=1 (W). So, both options leave opponent at
