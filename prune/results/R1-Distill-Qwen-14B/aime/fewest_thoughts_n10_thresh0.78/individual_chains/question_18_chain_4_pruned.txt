Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (which is a 12-sided polygon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The problem includes a diagram, but since I can't see it, I'll have to visualize a regular dodecagon and think about how rectangles can be formed inside it.

First, I should recall that a regular dodecagon has all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle can be calculated, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. More importantly, the dodecagon has 12 vertices, each separated by 30 degrees because a full circle is 360 degrees, and 360 divided by 12 is 30.

Since the problem mentions rectangles formed by sides or diagonals of the dodecagon, I need to think about how rectangles can be embedded within the dodecagon. Rectangles have opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. So, in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals must be arranged such that they can form these right angles.

I remember that in regular polygons, the number of sides and diagonals can form various lengths. For a regular polygon with n sides, the number of diagonals is n(n-3)/2. For a dodecagon, that would be 12*(12-3)/2 = 12*9/2 = 54 diagonals. But not all of these diagonals will be of the same length. In fact, in a regular dodecagon, there are diagonals of different lengths based on how many vertices they skip.

Wait, let me think about the lengths of the sides and diagonals. Each side length is the same, but the diagonals can be categorized based on the number of sides they skip. For example, in a regular polygon with an even number of sides, certain diagonals can be diameters of the circumscribed circle, which would be the longest diagonals. In a dodecagon, the diameter would connect two vertices opposite each other, right? Since 12 is even, each vertex has exactly one opposite vertex, and the diagonal connecting them would be the diameter.

But how does this help with forming rectangles? Well, if a rectangle is inscribed in a regular dodecagon, its sides must be either sides of the dodecagon or its diagonals. Moreover, the sides of the rectangle must align with the sides or diagonals, which implies that the rectangle's sides are either edges of the dodecagon or chords connecting non-adjacent vertices.

Another approach is to think about the vertices of the dodecagon as points on a circle. Each vertex is equally spaced around the circumference. So, if I can find four points (vertices) that form a rectangle, that should give me the count. But wait, not all four points would necessarily form a rectangle just because
