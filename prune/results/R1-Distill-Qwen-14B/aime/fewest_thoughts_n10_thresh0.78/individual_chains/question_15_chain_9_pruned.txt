Okay, so I need to figure out how many paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that on an 8x8 grid, each path from the lower left to the upper right consists of moving right and up. Since it's an 8x8 grid, you have to move right 8 times and up 8 times, totaling 16 steps. That makes sense because the problem mentions paths of length 16.

Now, the problem is about the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times. Direction changes happen when you switch from moving right to up or from up to right. So, each time you switch, that's a direction change.

Wait, so if a path changes direction four times, how does that translate into the number of straight segments? Let me think. Each direction change adds a new segment. So, starting with one segment, each direction change adds another. So, for four direction changes, the number of segments would be five. Because 1 change leads to 2 segments, 2 changes lead to 3 segments, and so on. So, four changes mean five segments.

But wait, in a grid path, the number of segments is determined by the number of times you switch direction plus one. So, if you have four direction changes, you have five segments. Each segment is either a horizontal (right) or vertical (up) move.

So, each path that changes direction four times is divided into five segments. Now, these segments alternate between right and up. The first segment could be either right or up. So, there are two cases: starting with a right move or starting with an up move.

Wait, but in a grid path, you have to end at the upper right corner. So, if the first segment is right, the last segment must be up. Similarly, if the first segment is up, the last must be right. So, the number of segments is fixed as five, regardless of the starting direction.

Hmm, but wait, no. Actually, the number of segments is five, regardless. Because starting direction affects the parity. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of right and up segments.

Each path alternates between right and up segments. So, if the first segment is right, the next is up, then right, then up, etc., leading to, for example, 3 right segments and 2 up segments if the number of segments is five. Or vice versa, depending on starting direction.

Wait, let's clarify. Let's say the first segment is right. Then the segments go right, up, right, up, right. So, 3 right segments and 2 up segments. Similarly, if the first segment is up, the segments would be up, right, up, right, up. So, 3 up segments and 2 right segments.

But wait, in an 8x8 grid, you need exactly 8 right and 8 up moves. So, if the path is divided into 5 segments, each segment must be a consecutive number of right or up moves.

So, in the case where we have 3 right segments
