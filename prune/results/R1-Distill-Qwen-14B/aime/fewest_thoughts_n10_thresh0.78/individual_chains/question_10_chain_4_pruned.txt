Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the elements of set A. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

So, Alice picks a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It's given that Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, set A is a set of positive integers. Then, Bob is looking at all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element is in A. So, for each set B, its max is in A. And the total number of such sets B is 2024.

I think I should model this. Let me try to think about how Bob is creating his list. For each element a in A, Bob can create sets B where the maximum is a. So, for each a in A, how many such sets B can there be?

Well, if the maximum is a, then all other elements in B must be less than a. So, for a specific a, the number of possible sets B would be the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, excluding the empty set, because B must be non-empty. Wait, no, actually, B itself is non-empty, but since the maximum is a, B has to contain a, so the other elements are from 1 to a-1 and can be any subset, including the empty set (since B can have just {a}).

Wait, right. So for a given a, the number of sets B where max(B) = a is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, because each such subset can be combined with a to form B. Since the subsets can be empty, that's 2^{a-1} sets.

But wait, no. Because for each a, the set B must include a, and the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, including the empty set. So, the number of such B's is indeed 2^{a-1}.

So, if A has elements a_1, a_2, ..., a
