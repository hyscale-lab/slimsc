Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the number of residents in Aimeville who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, let me list out the given information to make it clearer:

- Total residents: 900.
- Number owning a diamond ring (D): 195.
- Number owning a set of golf clubs (G): 367.
- Number owning a garden spade (S): 562.
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (H), so that's 900 for H.
- Number of residents who own exactly two of these things: 437.
- Number who own exactly three: 234.
- We need to find those who own all four: D, G, S, H.

Hmm, okay. So all residents have at least one of these four items since everyone owns the candy hearts. So there are no residents with zero items. That helps because it means the total number of people is equal to the union of all four sets.

Wait, but how do we approach this? I remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Yeah, that's it. The inclusion-exclusion principle helps calculate the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on.

But this problem is giving me information about exactly two and exactly three items, not the overlaps. So I need to think about how to connect these concepts.

Let me recall: the number of people owning exactly two items is the sum of all pairwise intersections minus three times those who own all four. Wait, no, actually, the formula for exactly two is more about subtracting those who have three or four.

Wait, maybe I should write down the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets. The formula for the union of four sets is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ H| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |H| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩H| - |G∩S| - |G∩H| - |S∩H| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩H| + |D∩S∩H| + |G∩S∩H| - |D∩G∩S∩H|.

But since everyone owns at least one item, the union is 900. So:

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |H| - (sum of all pairwise intersections) + (sum of all triple intersections) - |D∩G∩S∩H|.

But the problem gives me the number of people who own exactly two things and exactly three things. Maybe I can express the sum of pairwise intersections in terms of these numbers.

I remember that the sum of all pairwise intersections (like |D∩G|
