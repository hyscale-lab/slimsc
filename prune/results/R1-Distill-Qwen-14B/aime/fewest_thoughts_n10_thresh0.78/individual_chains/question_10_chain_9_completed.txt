Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the elements of set A that Alice chooses. Let me read the problem again carefully.

"Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A."

Hmm, so Alice picks a set A, and then Bob creates all possible finite non-empty sets B where the maximum of B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024. I need to find the sum of elements in A.

Let me try to understand the relationship between A and these sets B. Each set B is finite and non-empty, and the maximum element in B is in A. So for each element a in A, we can consider all possible sets B where a is the maximum.

Wait, that makes sense. So for a particular a in A, how many sets B can we form where a is the maximum? Well, if a is the maximum, then the other elements of B have to be less than a. So the other elements are selected from the positive integers less than a.

But wait, the positive integers less than a include 1, 2, ..., a-1. So the number of possible subsets (including the empty set) is 2^{a-1}. But since B has to be non-empty and have a as the maximum, the number of possible B's for a particular a is 2^{a-1} minus 1 (because the empty set is excluded). Wait, no, actually, wait: when a is the maximum, the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, but since B is non-empty, but the maximum is already a, so the other elements can be any subset, including empty. Wait, no. Wait, each B must be non-empty, but since a is included, each such B must contain a and any combination of elements less than a, including none. So the number of such sets is 2^{a-1}.

Wait, that makes sense because for each element less than a, it can be either included or not. So for a in A, the number of B's where a is the maximum is 2^{a-1}. But wait, does that include the case where B only has a? Because if the other elements are all not included, then B is just {a}, which is a valid B. So 2^{a-1} is correct.

So total number of sets B that Bob lists is the sum over all a in A of 2^{a-1}. And according to the problem, this sum is 2024.

So:

Sum_{a ∈ A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024.

And we need to find Sum_{a ∈ A} a.

Okay, so let me write that equation again:

Sum_{a ∈ A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024.

We need to find Sum_{a ∈ A} a.

So the problem reduces to finding a set A such that the sum of 2^{a-1} over all a in A is 2024. Then, once we find such an A, we compute the sum of its elements.

Hmm, so perhaps A is a set of numbers where each number is a power of 2, or something like that? Because 2^{a-1} suggests that the numbers a in A are related to powers of 2.

Let me think. 2^{a-1} for a=1 is 1, a=2 is 2, a=3 is 4, a=4 is 8, and so on. So if A is a set containing numbers such that 2^{a-1} adds up to 2024, then perhaps A consists of numbers like 1, 2, 4, etc.

Wait, but 2^{a-1} for a=1 is 1, a=2 is 2, a=3 is 4, a=4 is 8, a=5 is 16, a=6 is 32, a=7 is 64, a=8 is 128, a=9 is 256, a=10 is 512, a=11 is 1024, a=12 is 2048. Wait, 2048 is larger than 2024, so the maximum a in A can't be 12, since 2^{12-1}=2048 which is more than 2024.

So perhaps A consists of some subset of these exponents such that their 2^{a-1} sum to 2024.

Wait, but 2024 is a specific number. Let me try to break it down into powers of 2.

But wait, 2024 in binary is... let me calculate.

2024 divided by 2 is 1012, rem 0.

1012 /2=506, rem 0.

506/2=253, rem 0.

253/2=126 rem 1.

126/2=63 rem 0.

63/2=31 rem 1.

31/2=15 rem 1.

15/2=7 rem 1.

7/2=3 rem 1.

3/2=1 rem 1.

1/2=0 rem 1.

So writing the remainders from last to first: 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0.

Wait, let me count the bits:

11111101000.

Wait, that's 11 bits. Let me check: 2^10 is 1024, 2^11 is 2048.

Wait, 2024 in binary:

2024 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4.

Wait, no, that's too much. Let me compute 2024.

Wait, 1024 is 2^10. 2024 - 1024 = 1000.

1000: 512 is 2^9. 1000 - 512 = 488.

488: 256 is 2^8. 488 - 256 = 232.

232: 128 is 2^7. 232 - 128 = 104.

104: 64 is 2^6. 104 -64=40.

40: 32 is 2^5. 40-32=8.

8 is 2^3. So 8=2^3.

So 2024 = 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

Wait, let me check: 1024 + 512 = 1536; +256=1792; +128=1920; +64=1984; +32=2016; +8=2024. Yes, that's right.

So 2024 is 11111101000 in binary, where the 11th bit is set (position 10 if starting from 0), then bits 9, 8,7,6,5, and 3.

So if the sum Sum_{a ∈ A} 2^{a-1} = 2024, then perhaps each term 2^{a-1} in the sum corresponds to a 1 in the binary representation. So perhaps each a-1 corresponds to the exponents where the binary digits are 1.

Wait, but in the sum, each 2^{a-1} is like a term, so when we sum them, it's like adding powers of 2. So if the sum is 2024, which is the sum of 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3, then each a-1 must be one of those exponents. So a-1 =10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

Therefore, a =11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

Wait, because a-1 is 10, so a=11; a-1=9, a=10; and so on.

So A would consist of the numbers 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

Wait, but let me check: the sum of 2^{a-1} for a=11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

So 2^{10} (a=11) is 1024.

a=10: 2^9=512.

a=9:2^8=256.

a=8:2^7=128.

a=7:2^6=64.

a=6:2^5=32.

a=4:2^3=8.

Adding them up:1024 +512=1536; +256=1792; +128=1920; +64=1984; +32=2016; +8=2024. Yes, that's correct.

So A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Wait, but wait: is there any other possible set A that could sum to 2024? Because 2024 is a specific number, but perhaps there are other ways to express 2024 as a sum of distinct 2^{a-1} terms.

Wait, but 2^{a-1} terms are unique, so each term is a distinct power of 2. So when you sum distinct powers of 2, the representation is unique, just like binary numbers. So 2024 can be expressed as the sum of those specific powers, and that's the only way.

Therefore, A must be {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me list the a's again: a-1 is 10,9,8,7,6,5,3, so a is 11,10,9,8,7,6,4. So yes, A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Now, the sum of elements of A is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11.

Let me compute that: 4+6=10; 10+7=17; 17+8=25; 25+9=34; 34+10=44; 44+11=55.

So the sum is 55.

Wait, but let me check again: 4+6=10, +7=17, +8=25, +9=34, +10=44, +11=55. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but is there another possibility? For example, could A have other elements besides these 7 numbers, but their 2^{a-1} sum up to 2024? Or is this the only way?

Wait, 2024 is 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3. So each term is a distinct power of 2, and each term corresponds to a specific a. So for each term, a-1 must be the exponent. So a-1=3 → a=4; a-1=5 →a=6; a-1=6→a=7; a-1=7→a=8; a-1=8→a=9; a-1=9→a=10; a-1=10→a=11. So that's the only possible A.

Hence, the sum is 55.


Alice chooses a set \( A \) of positive integers. Bob then lists all finite nonempty sets \( B \) of positive integers where the maximum element of \( B \) belongs to \( A \). The number of such sets \( B \) is given as 2024. To find the sum of the elements of \( A \), we analyze the relationship between \( A \) and these sets \( B \).

For each element \( a \) in \( A \), the number of sets \( B \) where \( a \) is the maximum element is \( 2^{a-1} \). This is because the other elements of \( B \) can be any subset of the positive integers less than \( a \), including the empty subset. Therefore, the total number of sets \( B \) is the sum of \( 2^{a-1} \) for all \( a \) in \( A \):

\[
\sum_{a \in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024
\]

We need to find a set \( A \) such that this sum equals 2024. Expressing 2024 in binary, we find that it is the sum of the powers of 2 corresponding to exponents 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Thus, the exponents \( a-1 \) correspond to these values, leading to \( a \) being 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Therefore, the set \( A \) is \( \{4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\} \).

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is:

\[
4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55
\]

Thus, the sum of the elements of \( A \) is \(\boxed{55}\).
