Okay, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a special point inside it to each of its faces. The point I is equidistant from all four faces, which I think means it's the incenter of the tetrahedron, similar to the incenter in a triangle. 

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the radius of the inscribed sphere) can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area. So, I need to figure out both the volume and the surface area.

But wait, before that, I should probably note down all the given edge lengths:

- AB = CD = sqrt(41)
- AC = BD = sqrt(80)
- BC = AD = sqrt(89)

Hmm, that's interesting. It seems like the opposite edges are equal. So, AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD. That symmetry might help simplify things.

I think this kind of tetrahedron is called a "isohedral" tetrahedron or maybe a "disphenoid." Wait, no, a disphenoid has opposite edges equal, which is exactly what we have here. So, ABCD is a disphenoid. That's a good term to know because it might have properties that make calculations easier.

So, for a disphenoid, I think all faces are congruent triangles. Let me check that. Each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Let me verify if these can form a triangle.

Wait, sqrt(41) is about 6.4, sqrt(80) is about 8.94, and sqrt(89) is about 9.43. So, 6.4 + 8.94 > 9.43? 15.34 > 9.43, yes. Similarly, the other combinations will also satisfy the triangle inequality. So, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, all four faces are congruent. That's helpful because it means the surface area will be four times the area of one face, and the volume formula for a disphenoid might be simpler.

But wait, no, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron with four congruent triangular faces. But in this case, all four faces are congruent, so yes, it's a disphenoid. So, that symmetry should help.

Now, to find the inradius, I need the volume and the surface area. Let's tackle the surface area first.

Each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, if I can find the area of one face and multiply by four, I will get the total surface area.

To find the area of a triangle with sides a, b, c, I can use Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter s is (a + b + c)/2. Then, the area is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].

Let me compute s for one face:

s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2

But that looks messy. Maybe I can square it or find some other way. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to find the area if I can compute the height or use vectors.

Wait, maybe using vectors or coordinates might be a good approach here. If I can assign coordinates to the vertices, then I can compute the volume and surface area more directly.

Since the tetrahedron is symmetric, maybe I can place it in a coordinate system such that the centroid is at the origin or
