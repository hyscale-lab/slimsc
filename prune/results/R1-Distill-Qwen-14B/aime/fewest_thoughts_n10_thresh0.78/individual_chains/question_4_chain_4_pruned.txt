Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy no matter how Alice plays. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down.

First, this seems like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as either winning or losing positions. A winning position means the current player can force a win regardless of what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, let's think about small values of n and see if we can find a pattern. Maybe I can figure out the losing positions and then count how many of them are ≤2024.

Let's start with n=1. If there's 1 token and Alice goes first, she takes it and wins. So, n=1 is a winning position for Alice, which means it's a losing position for Bob. So, Bob can't win here.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob is forced to take that last token and win. Wait, no. Wait, if Alice takes 1, then Bob is left with 1, so Bob takes it and wins. But Alice would instead take 2 tokens, but wait, she can only take 1 or 4. So, from n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes the last token and wins. So, n=2: Alice can't win? Or wait, if Alice takes 1, Bob can take the last one. So, Alice can choose to take 1, leaving Bob with n=1, which is a losing position for Bob because Alice would have already taken the last token. Wait, no, wait, when n=1, the player whose turn it is takes it and wins. So, for n=2, Alice's options are to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes the last one and wins. So, n=2: if Alice takes 1, Bob can win. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob? Wait, no, no. Wait, the starting player is Alice, so if n=2, Alice can only take 1 or 4. She can't take 4 because there's only 2. So, she takes 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So, for n=2, Alice can't force a win, so n=2 is a winning position for Bob. Wait, no, because if n=2 is the starting position, Alice can only take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob takes 1 and wins. So, for n=2, Alice is forced to let Bob win. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob. So, Bob can win when n=2.

Wait, maybe I should define the positions as P-positions (previous player can force a win) and N-positions (next player can force a win).
