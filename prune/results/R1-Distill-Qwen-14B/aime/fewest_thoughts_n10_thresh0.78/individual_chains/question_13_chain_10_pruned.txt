Okay, so I need to solve this math problem about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to understand what's given and what's being asked.

So, Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She has two different walking speeds, and for each speed, the total time she takes, including a coffee stop, is given. The problem is asking me to find the total time she takes when she walks at a speed of s + ½ kilometers per hour, including the same coffee stop time t.

Hmm, let me break down the information:

1. When she walks at speed s km/h, the walk takes her 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop.
2. When she walks at speed s + 2 km/h, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including t minutes in the coffee shop.

Wait, I think the key here is that the time spent in the coffee shop is the same in both cases. So, the difference in the total time must be because she's walking faster the second time, thus taking less time on the actual walking part.

Let me think in terms of equations. Let's denote the time she spends walking as T1 and T2 for the two different speeds. The total time includes T (walking time) plus t (coffee time). So:

For the first case:
Total time = T1 + t = 4 hours. But wait, 4 hours is the total time including t. So, T1 = 4 hours - t.

Wait, no, actually, the total time given is 4 hours, which includes t minutes. So, I need to be careful about units here. Let me convert everything into hours or minutes to avoid confusion.

Let me convert the times entirely into minutes for easier calculations.

First case:
Total time = 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. This includes t minutes in the coffee shop. So the walking time is 240 - t minutes.

Second case:
Total time = 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that to minutes. 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 24 minutes, so 144 minutes. This includes t minutes, so walking time is 144 - t minutes.

Wait, another approach: Since the distance is the same (9 km), I can use the formula: distance = speed × time.

But the time here is walking time, not including the coffee stop. So, for the first case, walking time is (240 - t) minutes. But wait, speed is in km per hour, so I should convert walking time into hours.

Let me correct that. Let me express the walking time in hours:

First case:
Walking time = (240 - t) minutes = (240 - t)/60 hours.

Speed = s km/h, so distance = s * [(240 - t)/60] = 9 km.

Second case:
Walking time = (144 - t) minutes = (144 - t)/60 hours.

Speed = (s + 2) km/h, so distance = (s + 2) * [(144 - t)/60] = 9 km.

So now I have two equations:

1. s * [(240 - t)/60] = 9
2. (s + 2) * [(144 - t)/60] = 9

I can write these equations more simply:

1. s * (240 - t) = 9 * 60 = 540
   So, equation (1): s*(240 - t) = 540

2. (s + 2) * (144 - t) = 540
   So, equation (2): (s + 2)*(144 - t) = 540

Now I have two equations with two variables, s and t. I can solve them simultaneously.

Let me expand both equations.

Equation (1):
240s - s*t = 540

Equation (2):
(s + 2)*(144 - t) = 540
Expanding this:
s*144 - s*t + 2*144 - 2*t = 540
144s - s*t + 288 - 2t = 540

Now let me write both equations:

Equation (1): 240s - s t = 540 --> (1)

Equation (2): 144s - s t + 288 - 2t = 540 --> (2)

Hmm, maybe I can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate some variables.

Wait, equation (2) minus equation (1):

(144s - s t + 288 - 2t) - (240s - s t) = 540 - 540

Simplify:

144s - s t + 288 - 2t - 240s + s t = 0

Simplify terms:

(144s - 240s) + (-s t + s t) + 288 - 2t = 0

Which is:

-96s + 0 + 288 - 2t = 0

So:

-96s + 2
