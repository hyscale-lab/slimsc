Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. I'm a bit nervous because it seems a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to understand the problem statement. So, we have points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These points form a triangle, I think. AB is one of the sides of this triangle.

Then, there's a family of segments F, which are segments PQ of unit length. Each PQ lies in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, for each such segment, P is (p,0) and Q is (0,q), and the distance between them is 1. Since it's in the first quadrant, p and q are positive.

So, the family F consists of all segments PQ where PQ is length 1, P is on x-axis, Q on y-axis. So, for each such segment, the equation is (p,0) to (0,q), with sqrt(p² + q²) = 1.

Wait, no, actually, the distance between P and Q should be 1. So, sqrt( (p - 0)^2 + (0 - q)^2 ) = 1. So, p² + q² = 1.

So, each PQ is a segment from (p,0) to (0,q), with p² + q² = 1.

Now, the main part: There's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, except for AB, none of the other segments in F pass through C.

We need to find OC², where O is the origin, and express it as p/q, then find p + q.

Hmm. So, point C is on AB, and it's the only point (other than A and B) that isn't on any other segment from F besides AB.

So, my plan is:

1. Find the equation of line AB.
2. For any point C on AB, other than A and B, find conditions under which it doesn't lie on any other segment PQ in F except AB itself.
3. Find such a unique point C, then compute OC².

Let me start with step 1.

First, find the equation of AB.

Points A and B are given at (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's write the equation of the line AB.

The slope m is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So, the slope is -sqrt(3). Using point-slope form, using point A (1/2, 0):

y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2)

So, y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2)

So, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, any point C on AB can be parameterized. Let's let C be (x, y), where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, let me express x in terms of a parameter t, maybe. Let's say t is the x-coordinate of C, so x = t, then y = -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2.

So, C(t) = (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2).

Now, since C is on AB, t must be between 0 and 1/2, because A is at (1/2, 0) and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, t ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Now, the key idea is that C must not lie on any other segment PQ in F except AB. So, for all other segments PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

Wait, but wait, isn't AB itself a segment in F? Because AB has length sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So yes, AB is one of the segments in F. So, C is on AB, which is in F, but it doesn't lie on any other segment from F.

So, the point C can't lie on any other PQ from F besides AB. So, for all other PQ in F (excluding AB), C is not on PQ.

So, our task is to find such a point C on AB (other than A and B) that for all other PQ in F, C is not on PQ. But it's stated that such a point is unique.

So, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F, or maybe it's the point where the envelope touches AB, and beyond that, the other PQs don't pass through C.

Wait, maybe the family F forms an envelope, and the point C is where the envelope is tangent to AB.

So, perhaps I can find the envelope of the family F and see where it touches AB.

Alternatively, perhaps for each point C on AB, we can find whether it's on any other PQ. But since the problem states that only C is such that it is on AB and no other PQ, we can model this condition.

So, let's model this. Suppose C is on AB, and suppose that C also lies on another segment PQ from F. Then, we need to find the point C where this is impossible except for PQ being AB.

So, let's consider the equation of a general segment PQ.

P is (p,0), Q is (0,q), with p² + q² = 1.

The equation of PQ can be found using the two-point form.

The slope of PQ is (q - 0)/(0 - p) = -q/p.

So, equation is y = (-q/p)x + q.

Wait, because when x = p, y=0. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, when x=0, y=q. When x=p, y=0. So, the equation is y = (-q/p)x + q.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the equation of PQ is y = (-q/p)x + q, where p² + q² = 1.

Now, point C is on AB, so its coordinates are (t, -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2). Let's call this point (t, y(t)).

Now, for C to lie on PQ, it must satisfy y(t) = (-q/p) t + q.

But since p² + q² = 1, we can express q in terms of p, or vice versa.

Let me write this equation:

-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 = (-q/p) t + q.

We can rearrange this equation to find a relation between p and q, given t.

But since p² + q² = 1, we can treat this as a system of equations.

So, for a given t, the point C(t) lies on PQ if there exists p and q such that p² + q² =1 and:

(-q/p) t + q = y(t) = -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2.

So, let me write this equation again.

(-q/p) t + q = -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2.

Let me rearrange terms:

(-q t)/p + q = (-sqrt(3) t) + (sqrt(3)/2).

Let me factor q:

q [ (-t)/p + 1 ] = -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2.

Hmm. So, for a given t, this equation must hold. But p and q are related by p² + q² = 1.

So, perhaps we can parameterize p and q. Let me let p = cosθ and q = sinθ, since p² + q² =1.

Then, for each θ, p=cosθ, q=sinθ, so the equation becomes:

sinθ [ (-t)/cosθ + 1 ] = -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2.

Simplify the left side:

sinθ [ (-t + cosθ)/cosθ ]

= [ sinθ (cosθ - t) ] / cosθ

= sinθ (cosθ - t) / cosθ

= [ sinθ cosθ - t sinθ ] / cosθ

= sinθ - t tanθ.

So, the equation becomes:

sinθ - t tanθ = -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2.

Let me write this as:

sinθ - t tanθ + sqrt(3) t - sqrt(3)/2 = 0.

Hmm. Let's rearrange terms:

sinθ + [ - tanθ + sqrt(3) ] t - sqrt(3)/2 = 0.

Hmm. Let me think about this equation. It's an equation in θ, given t. For each t, this equation may have solutions θ, which would correspond to PQs passing through C(t).

But for C(t) to not lie on any other PQ (except AB), this equation should have no solution for θ except when PQ is AB.

Wait, but AB is one of the PQs. So, when t is something, perhaps there is only one solution θ, which is the one corresponding to AB.

Wait, but AB is a specific PQ. Let me find what θ corresponds to AB.

Point A is (1/2, 0), so p = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2.

So, p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2. So, cosθ = 1/2, so θ=60 degrees, or π/3 radians.

Similarly, sinθ = sqrt(3)/2, which matches. So, AB corresponds to θ=π/3.

So, when t is such that the equation above has only θ=π/3 as a solution, then C(t) is only on AB and no other PQ.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps we can find t such that the equation has only one solution, which would correspond to tangency.

Wait, considering that for each t, the equation in θ is linear in sinθ and tanθ, which complicates things. Maybe another approach is better.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of the envelope of the family of lines PQ.

The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, perhaps the envelope of all PQs will touch each PQ at exactly one point, and any point on the envelope lies on exactly one PQ.

So, if we can find the envelope of the family F, then the point C would be the intersection point of AB and this envelope. Since the envelope is tangent to each PQ at some point, and AB is one of the PQs, then the envelope would touch AB at point C, and beyond that, AB doesn't intersect any other PQ except at C.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the envelope is the curve that is tangent to all PQs. So, if we can find the envelope, then point C is where AB is tangent to the envelope. Thus, AB would only intersect the envelope at C, and no other PQ would pass through C.

That makes sense. So, the strategy is to find the envelope of the family F, then find where AB is tangent to this envelope. The point C is that point of tangency.

So, how do I find the envelope of the family F?

The family F consists of lines PQ, each described by the equation y = (-q/p)x + q, with p² + q² = 1.

Alternatively, using θ, as we did before, since p = cosθ, q = sinθ, the equation becomes y = (-sinθ/cosθ)x + sinθ, which is y = -tanθ x + sinθ.

So, the family of lines can be written as y = -tanθ x + sinθ, where θ is a parameter varying from 0 to π/2.

Wait, because p and q are positive, θ ranges from 0 to π/2.

To find the envelope, we can use the method where we solve the system:

F(θ, x, y) = y + tanθ x - sinθ = 0,

and the derivative with respect to θ set to zero:

dF/dθ = 0.

So, let's compute dF/dθ.

F = y + tanθ x - sinθ.

dF/dθ = (d/dθ)(y) + (d/dθ)(tanθ x) - (d/dθ)(sinθ).

Since y is treated as a variable, not a function of θ, the derivative of y with respect to θ is zero.

So, dF/dθ = 0 + (x sec²θ) - cosθ.

Setting this equal to zero:

x sec²θ - cosθ = 0.

So, x sec²θ = cosθ.

Multiply both sides by cos²θ:

x = cos³θ.

Hmm, that's one equation. Now, from F=0, we have:

y = -tanθ x + sinθ.

Substituting x = cos³θ:

y = -tanθ * cos³θ + sinθ.

Simplify:

tanθ = sinθ / cosθ.

So, tanθ * cos³θ = (sinθ / cosθ) * cos³θ = sinθ * cos²θ.

So, y = - sinθ cos²θ + sinθ = sinθ (1 - cos²θ) = sinθ * sin²θ = sin³θ.

So, we have x = cos³θ, y = sin³θ.

So, the envelope is the parametric curve x = cos³θ, y = sin³θ, θ ∈ [0, π/2].

Alternatively, this is the astroid curve. The envelope is an astroid.

So, the astroid can be written in Cartesian coordinates as x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Wait, let me check:

If x = cos³θ, then x^(1/3) = cosθ.

Similarly, y^(1/3) = sinθ.

So, (x^(1/3))² + (y^(1/3))² = cos²θ + sin²θ = 1.

So, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Now, we need to find where the line AB is tangent to this astroid. Because the point C is where AB is tangent to the astroid, which means that C is the only point where AB meets the astroid, and thus, beyond that, AB doesn't intersect any other PQ except at C.

Wait, but actually, AB is part of the family F, so the point C is where AB is tangent to the astroid, meaning that at point C, AB is just touching the astroid, and thus, any other PQ would not pass through C.

So, our goal is to find the point C where line AB is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Now, to find the point of tangency between AB and the astroid, we need to find a point (x, y) on AB that also lies on the astroid and where the derivative of the astroid at that point equals the slope of AB.

Alternatively, since AB is given by y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2, and the astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1, we can find their intersection points and then determine where the tangents match.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to find where the line AB is tangent to the astroid, meaning that substituting y from AB into the astroid equation, the resulting equation has exactly one solution (the point of tangency). So, the discriminant would be zero.

So, let's proceed.

We have the line AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Substitute this into the astroid equation:

x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

So, substitute y:

x^(2/3) + [ (-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ) ]^(2/3) = 1.

Let me write this as:

x^(2/3) + [ sqrt(3)( -x + 1/2 ) ]^(2/3) = 1.

Hmm, let me factor sqrt(3) out:

sqrt(3) is a constant, so [sqrt(3)]^(2/3) = (3)^(1/3).

So, the second term becomes (3)^(1/3) * (-x + 1/2)^(2/3).

So, the equation becomes:

x^(2/3) + (3)^(1/3) * (-x + 1/2)^(2/3) = 1.

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe we can let u = x^(1/3) and v = (-x + 1/2)^(1/3), but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe we can make a substitution to simplify.

Let me consider t = x. Then, the equation is:

t^(2/3) + (3)^(1/3) * (-t + 1/2)^(2/3) = 1.

Hmm, perhaps we can let s = (-t + 1/2), so that t = (1/2) - s.

Wait, but that might complicate things more.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to parametrize the astroid and find where the derivative matches the slope of AB.

The astroid is given parametrically by x = cos³θ, y = sin³θ.

The slope of the astroid at point θ is given by dy/dx.

Compute dy/dx:

dy/dx = (dy/dθ) / (dx/dθ).

dy/dθ = 3 sin²θ cosθ,

dx/dθ = -3 cos²θ sinθ.

So, dy/dx = [3 sin²θ cosθ] / [ -3 cos²θ sinθ ] = - (sinθ)/(cosθ) = -tanθ.

So, the slope of the astroid at point θ is -tanθ.

We know that the line AB has slope -sqrt(3).

So, at the point of tangency, the slope of the astroid must be -sqrt(3). Therefore, -tanθ = -sqrt(3), so tanθ = sqrt(3). Thus, θ = π/3.

So, θ = π/3, which is 60 degrees.

So, the point of tangency on the astroid is at θ = π/3.

So, x = cos³(π/3), y = sin³(π/3).

Compute cos(π/3) = 1/2, so cos³(π/3) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8.

Similarly, sin(π/3) = sqrt(3)/2, so sin³(π/3) = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3 sqrt(3))/8.

So, the point is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

Wait, but we need to check if this point lies on AB.

The equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, plug x = 1/8 into AB's equation:

y = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8) )= (3 sqrt(3))/8.

Which matches the y-coordinate of the astroid point. So yes, this point (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8) lies on both AB and the astroid, and the slopes match there, so this is the point of tangency.

Thus, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

Now, we need to compute OC², where O is the origin (0,0). OC is the distance from O to C, which is sqrt( (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 ).

Compute this:

(1/8)^2 = 1/64,

(3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = (9 * 3)/64 = 27/64.

So, OC² = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.

Wait, 1 + 27 is 28, yes.

So, OC² = 7/16. So, p=7, q=16, which are coprime.

Therefore, p + q = 7 + 16 = 23.

Wait, but let me double-check. Wait, 1 + 27 is 28, 28/64 reduces to 7/16. Yes.

So, the answer should be 23.


To solve the problem, we first determine the equation of the line segment AB. Points A and B are given as \( A\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right) \) and \( B\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \). The slope of AB is calculated as \(-\sqrt{3}\), leading to the equation \( y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

Next, we consider the family of segments \( \overline{PQ} \) of unit length with \( P \) on the x-axis and \( Q \) on the y-axis. Each segment satisfies \( p^2 + q^2 = 1 \) and has the equation \( y = -\frac{q}{p}x + q \).

To find the unique point \( C \) on AB that does not lie on any other segment from \( \mathcal{F} \) except AB, we determine the envelope of the family \( \mathcal{F} \). This envelope is found to be the astroid \( x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1 \).

The point \( C \) is where the line AB is tangent to this astroid. Substituting the equation of AB into the astroid's equation and solving, we find that the point of tangency occurs at \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{3} \). This gives the coordinates of \( C \) as \( \left(\frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right) \).

Finally, we compute \( OC^2 \) as:
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}.
\]
Thus, \( p = 7 \) and \( q = 16 \), leading to \( p + q = 23 \).

\boxed{23}
