Okay, let's try to figure out how many rectangles can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. The problem says that each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, a dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a 12-sided polygon. 

First, I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with many sides, there are various ways to form rectangles by connecting vertices. But how exactly do I approach this?

I think the key here is to realize that a rectangle is defined by choosing two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular polygon, sides and diagonals can be parallel if they are separated by a certain number of steps around the polygon. So, maybe I should consider the number of ways to choose two different sets of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) that can form the opposite sides of a rectangle.

Wait, another thought: a regular dodecagon can be inscribed in a circle. So, each vertex is equally spaced around the circumference. This means that the central angle between any two adjacent vertices is 360/12 = 30 degrees. 

If I pick two vertices, the number of edges between them along the circumference corresponds to the length of the diagonal. For example, a side connects two adjacent vertices (step 1), a diagonal that skips one vertex is step 2, and so on, up to step 6, which would be the diameter of the circle. Beyond step 6, the diagonals start repeating in the opposite direction, so steps 7-11 are similar to steps 5-1, respectively.

So, for a regular dodecagon, the possible step sizes (or lengths) of sides and diagonals are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Each step size corresponds to a certain chord length.

Now, to form a rectangle, I think we need two pairs of parallel sides. In the polygon, two sides (or diagonals) are parallel if their step sizes are the same. So, if I pick two different step sizes, say m and n, then I need to see how many rectangles can be formed by these.

Wait, but rectangles require that the opposite sides are not only parallel but also equal in length.
