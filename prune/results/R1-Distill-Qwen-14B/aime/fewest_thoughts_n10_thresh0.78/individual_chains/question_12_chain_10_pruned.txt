Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It's about a 2x3 grid where each cell has a digit, and I need to figure out how many ways I can place these digits so that two conditions are met. The first condition is that when you read the numbers left to right, the sum is 999. The second condition is that when you read the numbers top to bottom, the sum is 99. 

Hmm, let me try to break this down. The grid is 2 rows by 3 columns, so there are six cells in total. Each cell is a single digit, right? So, the first thing I should probably do is visualize or sketch the grid to get a better idea.

Let me denote the grid like this:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 
a & b & c \\ \hline 
d & e & f \\ \hline 
\end{array}
\]

So, the first number formed by reading left to right in the top row is 'abc', which is a three-digit number. Similarly, the bottom row forms 'def'. So, the sum of these two numbers is 999. 

Wait, no, actually, the way the problem is phrased says "the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999." So, that would be the top row as a three-digit number and the bottom row as another three-digit number. Their sum should be 999. 

But also, the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. So, each column would form a two-digit number, right? Because each column has two cells, one from the top row and one from the bottom. So, the first column would be 'ad', the second column 'be', and the third column 'cf'. The sum of these three two-digit numbers should be 99.

Wait, let me confirm this understanding. When reading top to bottom, each column is a two-digit number. So, the sum is ad + be + cf = 99. And when reading left to right, the top row is abc, the bottom row is def, and their sum is abc + def = 999.

Yes, that makes sense. So, I have two equations to satisfy:

1. abc + def = 999
2. ad + be + cf = 99

Each of a, b, c, d, e, f is a digit from 0 to 9. But wait, there's a catch. Since 'abc' and 'def' are three-digit numbers, the first digit of each can't be zero, right? So, a and d cannot be zero. Because if a is zero, 'abc' would be a two-digit number, but it's supposed to be three digits. Similarly, d can't be zero for 'def'. 

So, a ∈ {1,2,...,9}, d ∈ {1,2,...,9}, and the rest (b, c, e, f) can be from
