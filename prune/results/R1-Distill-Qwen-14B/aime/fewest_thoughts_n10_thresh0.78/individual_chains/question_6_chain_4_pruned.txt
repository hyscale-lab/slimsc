Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations given are:

1. \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)
2. \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \)

And the functions f and g are defined as:
- \( f(x) = ||x| - \tfrac{1}{2}| \)
- \( g(x) = ||x| - \tfrac{1}{4}| \)

Hmm, okay. Both f and g are absolute value functions, which usually create V-shaped graphs. But since they're nested, it's going to be a bit more complicated. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should probably understand what f(x) and g(x) look like individually.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The innermost part is |x|, which is a V-shape centered at x=0. Then subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2 unit. Taking the absolute value of that would reflect any negative parts back up.

Let me sketch this out mentally. The function |x| is V-shaped with vertex at (0,0). Subtract 1/2: so it becomes |x| - 1/2, which would have a V shape but shifted down so the vertex is at (0, -1/2). But since we take the absolute value of that, any negative parts (where |x| < 1/2) will be flipped. So for x between -1/2 and 1/2, |x| is less than 1/2, so |x| - 1/2 is negative. Taking the absolute value would make it positive, so f(x) becomes positive in that interval.

Let me find the points where f(x) changes its behavior.

For |x| >= 1/2:
f(x) = |x| - 1/2

For |x| < 1/2:
f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|

So, f(x) is a V shape that actually has a "W" shape maybe? Let me see.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Because for |x| >= 1/2, it's |x| - 1/2, which is a V increasing with slope 1 on either side. But for |x| <1/2, it's 1/2 - |x|, which is another V but decreasing towards the center. So the overall graph is a W? Let me plot some points.

At x=0: f(0) = |0| - 1/2 inside, then absolute value: ||0| - 1/2| = | -1/2 | = 1/2.

At x=1/2: f(1/2) = |1/2| - 1/2 = 0, then absolute value is 0. So the point is (1/2, 0). Similarly at x=-1/2, it's 0.

At x=1: f(1) = |1| - 1/2 = 1/2, absolute value is 1/2, so point is (1, 1/2).

Similarly, x= -1: (-1, 1/2).

So connecting these points: at x=0, it's 1/2, then it goes down to 0 at x=±1/2, then up to 1/2 again at x=±1. So the graph of f(x) is like a diamond shape, going from 1/2 at x=0, down to 0 at x=±1/2, up again to 1/2 at x=±1, and so on.

So f(x) is a periodic function with period 1? Wait, no, because it's built from absolute values, it's symmetric about x=0, x=1, x=-1, etc. So it's actually a function that repeats every 1 unit along the x-axis.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let me do the same analysis.

For |x| >= 1/4:
g(x) = |x| - 1/4

For |x| < 1/4:
g(x) = -( |x| - 1/4 ) = 1/4 - |x|

So plotting this, at x=0, g(0)=1/4.

At x=1/4: g(1/4)=0.

At x=1/2: |1/2| -1/4 = 1/4.

So the graph of g(x) is similar to f(x) but with a smaller dip. So it goes from 1/4 at x=0, down to 0 at x=±1/4, then up to 1/4 at x=±1/2, and so on. So it's also a periodic function, period 1.

Alright, so f and g are both piecewise linear functions with period 1, creating wave-like graphs.

Now, the first equation is y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))).

Let me break this down. Starting from the inside: sin(2πx). The sine function has a period of 1 because 2πx completes a cycle every 1 unit. So sin(2πx) is a wave that goes from 0 to 1 to 0 to -1 to 0
