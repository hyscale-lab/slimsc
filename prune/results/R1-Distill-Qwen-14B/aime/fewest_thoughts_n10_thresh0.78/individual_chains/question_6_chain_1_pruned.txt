Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). The functions f and g are defined as f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 | and g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what f and g are doing. Both are absolute value functions composed with each other. Starting with f(x): it's the absolute value of (|x| - 1/2). So, I can think of this as taking the absolute value of x first, then subtracting 1/2, and then taking the absolute value again. Similarly, g(x) is the absolute value of (|x| - 1/4). So, same structure but with a different constant.

Let me sketch these functions mentally. For f(x):

- When x is positive, |x| = x, so f(x) becomes |x - 1/2|. So, this is a V-shaped graph shifted right by 1/2, then taking absolute value, which would make it symmetric around x=1/2. Wait, but since it's | |x| - 1/2 |, actually, for all x, whether positive or negative, it's the same as | |x| - 1/2 |. So, the graph of f(x) will have a V-shape centered at x=0, but with a shift.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider it in parts. Let's consider f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |.

Case 1: |x| >= 1/2. Then, f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which is a V-shape starting at x=1/2 and x=-1/2, going upwards.

Case 2: |x| < 1/2. Then, f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|. So, this is a downward V between x=-1/2 and x=1/2, peaking at x=0 with f(0) = 1/2.

So, f(x) has a peak at x=0, height 1/2, and then slopes downward until x=±1/2, then it slopes upward beyond that. Similarly for g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |.

For g(x):

Case 1: |x| >= 1/4. Then, g(x) = |x| - 1/4.

Case 2: |x| < 1/4. Then, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|.

So, g(x) has a peak at x=0 of 1/4, slopes down until x=±1/4, then slopes up beyond that.

Now, the functions inside the problem are 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). So, let's try to understand what these transformations do.

Let me first analyze the inner functions. Let's start with f(sin(2πx)).

sin(2πx) is a sine wave with period 1, because the period of sin(2πx) is 1. So, it oscillates between -1 and 1, completing a full cycle every 1 unit in x.

Similarly, cos(3πy) is a cosine wave with period 2/3, since the period of cos(ky) is 2π/k, so here k=3π, so period is 2π/(3π) = 2/3.

So, both sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) are bounded between -1 and 1.

Now, f takes an
