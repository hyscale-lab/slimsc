Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

It says: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. We need to find the product xy.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can convert them into exponential form to make things clearer.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Remember that log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. So, in this case, x^10 = y^x. That's the first equation.

The second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Similarly, that means y^10 = x^{4y}. So now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

I need to solve for x and y, both greater than 1, and then find their product xy.

Hmm, okay. Let me see. Maybe I can express both equations in terms of exponents with the same base or relate x and y somehow.

From equation 1: x^10 = y^x. Let's take the natural logarithm of both sides to bring down the exponents.

ln(x^10) = ln(y^x)

Which simplifies to:

10 ln x = x ln y  ...(A)

Similarly, from equation 2: y^10 = x^{4y}

Take natural logs again:

ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y})

Which simplifies to:

10 ln y = 4y ln x  ...(B)

Now, I have two equations:

(A): 10 ln x = x ln y

(B): 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Hmm, perhaps I can express ln y in terms of ln x from one equation and substitute into the other.

From equation (A):

ln y = (10 ln x) / x

Let me substitute this into equation (B):

10 * [ (10 ln x) / x ] = 4y ln x

Simplify:

(100 ln x) / x = 4y ln x

Hmm, both sides have ln x, and since x >1, ln x isn't zero. So I can divide both sides by ln x:

100 / x = 4y

So, 4y = 100 / x

Which gives:

y = (100) / (4x) = 25 / x

So, y = 25 / x.

That's helpful. Now I can plug this back into one of the earlier equations to solve for x.

Let's go back to equation (A): 10 ln x = x ln y

But since y = 25 / x, ln y = ln(25 / x) = ln 25 - ln x.

Substituting into equation (A):

10 ln x = x (ln 25 - ln x)

Let me write that out:

10 ln x = x ln 25 - x ln x

Bring all terms to one side:

10 ln x + x ln x - x ln 25 = 0

Factor ln x from the first two terms:

ln x (10 + x) - x ln 25 = 0

Hmm, not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe rearrange the equation first.

10 ln x = x (ln 25 - ln x)

Let me expand the right side:

10 ln x = x ln 25 - x ln x

Bring all terms to the left:

10 ln x + x ln x - x ln 25 = 0

Factor ln x from the first two terms:

ln x (10 + x) - x ln 25 = 0

Alternatively, let's rearrange the equation:

10 ln x + x ln x = x ln 25

Factor ln x:

ln x (10 + x) = x ln 25

Hmm, so:

ln x = [x ln 25] / (10 + x)

But ln 25 is a constant. Let me compute that. 25 is 5 squared, so ln 25 = 2 ln 5 ≈ 2*1.6094 ≈3.2189. But I'll keep it as ln 25 for now.

So ln x = [x ln 25] / (10 + x)

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can express x in terms of y or find another substitution.

Wait, earlier we found that y = 25 / x, so x = 25 / y. Maybe substituting x in terms of y can help.

Wait, let me think. Since y =25/x, let's plug this into one of the original equations, maybe equation 1 or 2.

Let me see equation 1: x^10 = y^x

But y =25/x, so:

x^10 = (25/x)^x

Which is x^10 = (25^x)/(x^x)

Multiply both sides by x^x:

x^{10 + x} = 25^x

Hmm, so x^{x + 10} =25^x

Take natural logs:

(x + 10) ln x = x ln 25

So:

(x + 10) ln x = x ln 25

Expanding the left side:

x ln x +10 ln x = x ln 25

Bring all terms to left:

x ln x +10 ln x -x ln 25 =0

Factor ln x:

ln x (x + 10) -x ln 25 =0

Wait
