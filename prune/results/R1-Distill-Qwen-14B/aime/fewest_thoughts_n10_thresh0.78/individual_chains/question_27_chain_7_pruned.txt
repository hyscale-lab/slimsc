Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6 units. So, the major radius of the torus is 6, and the minor radius is 3.

Then there's a sphere with radius 11. The problem says that when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to figure out the radii of the circles where the torus is tangent to the sphere in both internal and external cases.

First, let's recall some properties of a torus. The standard equation for a torus in 3D is (sqrt(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r², where R is the major radius and r is the minor radius. In this case, R is 6, and r is 3.

But since the torus is tangent to the sphere, maybe I can model their centers relative to each other. The sphere has radius 11, so when the torus is inside the sphere, their centers must be positioned such that the distance between the centers is equal to 11 - something, and when it's outside, the distance is 11 + something.

Wait, but the torus isn't a solid; it's a surface. So, when it's resting inside the sphere, the closest point on the torus to the center of the sphere will be at a distance of 11 - something, and the farthest point will be at 11 + something. Similarly, when it's outside, the closest point will be 11 + something, and the farthest will be 11 + something else.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the internal tangent case first.

When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the sphere will touch the torus along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it will touch along another circle.

I think the key is to find the radius of these tangent circles, r_i and r_o, and then subtract them.

Let me try to model the geometry.

First, the torus is formed by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the major radius R is 6, and minor radius r is 3.

Consider the sphere with radius 11. When the torus is inside the sphere, the centers of the sphere and the torus must be aligned along the same axis. The sphere's center is at some point, and the torus is placed such that it's touching the sphere internally.

Wait, perhaps we can model the centers as being separated by a distance d. For internal tangency, the distance between the centers would be equal to the sphere's radius minus the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center plus the torus's minor radius? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center. Let me denote O as the center of the sphere, and C as the center of the generating circle of the torus. The generating circle has radius 3, and the distance between O and C
