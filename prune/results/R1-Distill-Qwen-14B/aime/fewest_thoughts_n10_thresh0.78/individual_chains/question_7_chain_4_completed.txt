Okay, so I've got this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability. We need to find the probability that after coloring, there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up at positions that were originally red. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. A regular octagon has 8 vertices, each colored red or blue with probability 1/2 each. So, each coloring is independent, and each vertex has a 1/2 chance of being red or blue.

We need to find the probability that there exists some rotation (so, a rotation by k positions, where k is 0, 1, 2, ..., 7) such that when we apply this rotation, every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. That is, after rotation, the image of each blue vertex under the rotation was red in the original coloring.

Wait, so if we have a coloring, and we rotate it by some k positions, then for all blue vertices in the original coloring, their new positions (after rotation) must have been red in the original. So, the rotated version of the blue vertices don't overlap with any blue in the original.

Alternatively, the set of blue vertices must map to the set of red vertices under some rotation. So, the blue set must be a rotation of the red set.

Wait, but since the octagon is regular and rotationally symmetric, the red and blue sets must form a kind of rotational shift of each other.

So, perhaps the blue vertices must be a rotated version of the red vertices. Hmm.

Wait, let me think. Let me denote the original coloring as a set B of blue vertices. After rotating by k positions, the image of B must be a subset of the red vertices in the original coloring.

But the red vertices are the complement of B. So, the image of B under rotation by k must be a subset of the complement of B. That is, B rotated by k is contained in the red set, which is the complement of B.

So, (B + k) ⊆ (V \ B), where V is the set of all 8 vertices.

Which is equivalent to (B + k) ∩ B = empty set.

So, the translated set B + k must not intersect B. So, B is a subset of V such that translating it by k positions doesn't overlap with itself.

Hmm, that seems like a kind of tiling condition or perhaps a condition similar to a shift register.

Alternatively, maybe B is a subset such that it is a complete set of coset representatives for some rotational shift.

Wait, perhaps the set B must be a union of certain orbits under rotation, but since it's a single shift, maybe it's more about the shift not overlapping.

Wait, maybe it's helpful to model the octagon as the cyclic group Z/8Z. So, the vertices can be labeled 0 through 7, and a rotation by k corresponds to adding k modulo 8.

So, each vertex is an element of Z8, and the rotation by k is the translation by k in Z8.

So, the problem reduces to finding the probability that there exists a k in Z8 such that (B + k) is contained in the complement of B.

Alternatively, B and B + k are disjoint.

So, the question becomes: for a random subset B of Z8, what is the probability that there's some k such that B and B + k are disjoint.

Alternatively, the probability that the subset B is "shift-avoiding" in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps looking for when the subset B is such that for some k, B + k is entirely within the complement of B. So, B and B + k are disjoint.

This seems like a combinatorial problem. Since each vertex is colored red or blue independently with probability 1/2, the number of blue vertices is a binomial random variable with n=8 and p=1/2.

But the probability we're seeking is not just about the number of blue vertices, but about their arrangement.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this using group theory or combinatorics.

Each possible coloring is a subset B of Z8, each with probability 2^(-8). We need the number of such subsets B where there exists a k such that (B + k) and B are disjoint.

So, the task is to count such subsets.

Alternatively, the number of subsets B with the property that there exists a rotation k such that B and B + k are disjoint.

So, let's denote this number as N. Then the probability is N / 2^8 = N / 256.

So, we need to compute N.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the problem using group actions. The group Z8 acts on the set of subsets of itself by translation. We are to find the number of subsets B fixed by some non-identity group element, but not quite fixed—more like, such that the image of B under a group element is entirely in the complement.

Wait, perhaps Burnside's lemma could be applied here, but I'm not sure yet. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps inclusion-exclusion can be used. But maybe it's tricky.

Alternatively, let's think about the possible values of k. For each k, we can consider the condition that B and B + k are disjoint. Then, the union over all k of these conditions would give the total number of subsets B that satisfy the condition for at least one k.

But this might lead to inclusion-exclusion because the events for different k's are not independent.

Wait, perhaps for each k, the number of subsets B such that B and B + k are disjoint is 2^(8 - d(k)), where d(k) is the number of overlaps when shifting by k. Wait, not sure.

Wait, let's fix a k. Let me first compute the number of subsets B such that B and B + k are disjoint.

If k=0, then B and B are disjoint only if B is empty, which has only 1 subset. So, N_k=0: 1 subset.

For other k's, say for k=1,2,...,7.

Wait, for a given k, the number of subsets B where B and B + k are disjoint is equal to the number of subsets B such that B is contained in V \ (B + k). So, B is a subset of V \ (B + k), which is equivalent to B ∩ (B +k) = empty.

So, how many such subsets are there?

Wait, for each k, the set V can be partitioned into orbits under the shift by k. But since 8 and k might not be coprime, the number of orbits is gcd(k,8). For each orbit, the subsets can be chosen such that no two elements in the same orbit are both in B. So, for each orbit, we can choose to include none, some, but not all elements in the orbit.

Wait, perhaps that's a standard combinatorial problem.

Wait, more specifically, when you have a cyclic shift by k, the permutation induced on the set V has cycles of length equal to the order of k in Z8, which is 8 / gcd(k,8). So, the number of cycles is gcd(k,8).

Each cycle is an orbit where each element is shifted by k each time. So, for each cycle, the subset B can include at most every other element, but in this case, since we need B and B +k to be disjoint, in each such cycle, B can include any subset except those that contain two elements at distance k apart.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each cycle as a separate component.

Wait, for example, if k is 1, then the permutation is a single 8-cycle. So, the condition is that in this 8-cycle, B cannot contain any two consecutive elements. Because if it did, then when you shift by 1, those two would overlap with some element in B.

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again.

If we have a shift by 1, then the condition is that B and B +1 are disjoint. So, if B contains vertex i, then it cannot contain vertex i+1. Because if it did, then when you shift B by 1, vertex i+1 would be in B +1, which would collide with vertex i+1 in the original B.

Wait, so in effect, the condition is that no two consecutive vertices can both be in B. Because if B contains i and i+1, then when you shift by 1, the image of B would contain i+1 and i+2, but B itself contains i+1, so their intersection is non-empty.

Wait, no, actually, if B contains i and i+1, then B +1 contains i+1 and i+2. So, the intersection is {i+1}, which is non-empty. So, to have B and B +1 disjoint, we must have that B does not contain any two consecutive elements. So, the number of such subsets is equal to the number of independent sets of size 8 in a cycle graph C8, where each vertex is connected to its next vertex.

Wait, in graph theory, an independent set is a set of vertices with no two adjacent. So, yes, the number of independent sets in a cycle graph C_n is known.

Similarly, for each k, the number of subsets B where B and B +k are disjoint depends on the cycle structure induced by shifting by k.

Wait, in general, for each k, the shift by k partitions the octagon into gcd(k,8) cycles, each of length 8 / gcd(k,8).

For example, if k=2, then the shift by 2 would have gcd(2,8)=2 cycles, each of length 4. So, each cycle is 0,2,4,6 and 1,3,5,7.

Similarly, for each such cycle, the condition that B and B +k are disjoint reduces to B not containing any two elements that are k apart in the same cycle.

Wait, for a cycle of length m, the condition is that in each cycle, B can't contain two elements that are adjacent in the cycle. Because shifting by k would move each element to the next in the cycle.

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, for each cycle, the condition is that B cannot contain any two elements that are in the same orbit under the shift by k, because shifting by k would cause overlaps.

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to model each cycle as a path graph with the endpoints connected (since it's a cycle). Then, the number of independent sets on each cycle is F_{m+2}, where F is the Fibonacci sequence, but I need to check.

Wait, no, the number of independent sets on a cycle graph C_m is F_{m+2}. So, for each cycle of length m, the number of allowed subsets is F_{m+2}, where F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, etc.

Wait, let me verify that. For a path graph P_m, the number of independent sets is F_{m+2}. For a cycle C_m, it's F_{m} + F_{m-2} or something else? Let me think.

Wait, actually, the number of independent sets on a cycle C_m is equal to F_{m} + F_{m-2}, I think. Wait, maybe it's better to use recurrence relations.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of inclusion-exclusion for each shift k.

Wait, but perhaps for each k, the number of subsets B where B and B +k are disjoint is 2^{8 - number of overlaps}.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps for a shift k, the condition is that B is a subset that doesn't contain any pair of elements that are k apart.

So, for each k, the number of subsets B where B and B +k are disjoint is equal to the number of subsets of V that don't contain any two elements at distance k.

Wait, but since the octagon is cyclic, the distance is k in either direction. Wait, no, in this problem, when we shift by k, the distance is k steps in the forward direction.

Wait, but for the condition B ∩ (B +k) = empty, it's equivalent to saying that for no i is i in B and i +k in B. So, in other words, B cannot contain any two elements that are k apart in the cyclic order.

So, for each shift k, the number of such subsets is equal to the number of subsets of the octagon with no two elements at distance k.

Hmm, okay, so for each k, the number of B where B and B +k are disjoint is equal to the number of independent sets on a graph where each vertex is connected to the vertex k steps ahead. So, the graph is a collection of cycles, each of length m = 8 / gcd(k,8).

Wait, for example, when k=1, the graph is a single 8-cycle, so the number of independent sets is F_{8+2} = F_{10} = 55. But wait, no, wait: for a cycle graph C_m, the number of independent sets is F_{m} + F_{m-2} or something else?

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute it for small m.

Wait, for a cycle C_3: the number of independent sets is 3 (empty set, {1}, {2}, {3}, but wait, no, wait: no two adjacent. So, for C_3, the independent sets are:

- Empty set: 1

- Single vertices: 3

- Two non-adjacent vertices: 0, since in a triangle, all are adjacent.

Wait, no, wait: in a triangle, any two vertices are adjacent, so you can't have two in the set. So, the number is 4 (empty, {1}, {2}, {3}).

Wait, but according to some sources, the number of independent sets on C_3 is 4, which is F_5=5? Wait, no, F_5 is 5, but that's 4 here. Hmm, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe it's better to use the formula for the number of independent sets on a cycle graph C_n: it's F_{n+1} + F_{n-1}.

Wait, for C_3: F_4 + F_2 = 3 + 1 = 4. That matches.

For C_4: F_5 + F_3 = 5 + 2 =7. Let's see, C_4 has 7 independent sets:

- Empty:1

- Single vertices:4

- Two non-adjacent:2 (e.g., {1,3}, {2,4})

Total: 1+4+2=7. Yes, that's correct.

So, the formula seems to hold: number of independent sets on C_m is F_{m+1} + F_{m-1} = F_{m+1} + F_{m-1}.

Wait, but that's equal to L_m, the Lucas numbers, which is F_{m-1} + F_{m+1}.

Wait, okay, so for each cycle of length m, the number of independent sets is L_m.

So, for a shift by k, the number of subsets B where B and B +k are disjoint is equal to the product over each cycle of L_{m}, where m is the length of each cycle.

Wait, but when the shift is k, the number of cycles is d = gcd(k,8), and each cycle has length m =8/d.

So, for each shift k, the number of subsets B where B and B +k are disjoint is (L_{8/d})^d.

Wait, let's test this for k=1.

k=1: d = gcd(1,8)=1, so m=8. So, number of subsets is L_8^1.

L_8 is F_7 + F_9 = 13 + 34 =47? Wait, wait, maybe I'm confusing the formula.

Wait, earlier, I thought that for a cycle of length m, the number of independent sets is L_m, but perhaps it's better to check specific values.

Wait, for m=3, L_3 is 4, which matches. For m=4, L_4 is 7, which matches.

Wait, the Lucas numbers are defined as L_0=2, L_1=1, L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2}.

So, L_2=3, L_3=4, L_4=7, L_5=11, L_6=18, L_7=29, L_8=47.

So, for m=8, L_8=47. So, for k=1, the number of subsets B where B and B +1 are disjoint is 47.

Similarly, for k=2, d = gcd(2,8)=2, so m=4. Each cycle is of length 4, and there are 2 cycles. So, the number of subsets B would be (L_4)^2 = 7^2 = 49.

Wait, but wait, let me check that.

Wait, when k=2, the shift by 2 would split the octagon into two cycles: {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7}. Each cycle is length 4, so for each cycle, the number of independent sets is L_4=7. So, the total number of subsets B where B and B +2 are disjoint is 7 * 7 =49.

Yes, that makes sense.

Similarly, for k=3, d = gcd(3,8)=1, so m=8. So, the number of subsets is L_8=47.

For k=4, d = gcd(4,8)=4, so m=2. There are 4 cycles, each of length 2. The number of independent sets on a cycle of length 2 (which is just two connected vertices) is 3: empty set, {0}, {1}.

Wait, for a cycle of length 2, the number of independent sets is 3, which is L_2=3.

So, for k=4, the number of subsets B where B and B +4 are disjoint is (L_2)^4 =3^4=81.

Wait, but when k=4, the shift by 4 is equivalent to taking complements, right? Because shifting by 4 positions in an octagon is equivalent to rotating 180 degrees.

So, B and B +4 are complements. So, the condition B ∩ (B +4) = empty is equivalent to B being a subset of the complement of B +4, which is B itself, since B +4 is the complement when k=4.

Wait, no, if we have a shift by 4, each element i is mapped to i+4 mod 8. So, for example, if B is any subset, then B +4 is the subset consisting of elements i+4 for each i in B. But in an octagon, adding 4 is the same as taking the opposite vertex.

So, for example, if B contains 0, then B +4 contains 4. So, if B contains 0 and 4, then B and B +4 share the elements 0 and 4.

Wait, but the condition is that B and B +4 are disjoint. So, if B and B +4 are disjoint, then B ∩ (B +4) = empty. So, for example, B can't contain both 0 and 4, nor 1 and 5, etc.

Wait, so for each pair {i, i+4}, B can contain at most one of them.

Which is equivalent to choosing, for each of the 4 pairs, to include none, one, or the other. Wait, but no, in this case, since B and B +4 must be disjoint, for each pair {i, i+4}, B can contain at most one of them. So, for each of the 4 pairs, we have 3 choices: include neither, include i, or include i+4. So, the number of subsets is 3^4=81, which matches our earlier calculation.

So, that seems correct.

Similarly, for k=5, which is equivalent to k=3 because 5 mod 8 is -3, so the number of subsets is L_8=47.

For k=6, which is equivalent to k=2, so the number is L_4^2=7^2=49.

For k=7, which is equivalent to k=1, the number is L_8=47.

Wait, but wait, when k=0, the shift by 0 is the identity, so the condition is that B and B are disjoint, which only occurs when B is empty. So, the number of subsets for k=0 is 1.

So, now, let's tabulate for each k from 0 to 7, the number of subsets B where B and B +k are disjoint:

k=0: 1

k=1:47

k=2:49

k=3:47

k=4:81

k=5:47

k=6:49

k=7:47

Now, the total number of subsets B where there exists some k such that B and B +k are disjoint is the union over all these k's. But since some subsets might satisfy the condition for multiple k's, we can't just add them up directly; we have to use inclusion-exclusion.

Wait, but inclusion-exclusion for all 8 shifts would be complicated, but perhaps we can find a smarter way.

Wait, but perhaps the problem can be approached using generating functions or Möbius inversion on the group Z8.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that the problem is equivalent to finding the number of subsets B such that B is a subset of V \ (B +k) for some k.

Which is equivalent to B being a subset of the complement of (B +k). So, B is a subset of (V \ (B +k)).

Alternatively, B is contained in the complement of its own shift by k.

Wait, perhaps another approach: for each subset B, let’s consider the set S(B) = {k ∈ Z8 | B ∩ (B +k) = empty}.

We need to count the number of subsets B where S(B) is non-empty.

So, the total number N is the number of B where |S(B)| ≥ 1.

To compute N, we can use inclusion-exclusion over the possible k's.

But perhaps it's better to compute the total number of ordered pairs (B, k) where B and B +k are disjoint, then use that to find the number of B with at least one k.

But that approach could lead to overcounting because a single B might be counted multiple times if it satisfies the condition for multiple k's.

Alternatively, perhaps Burnside's lemma can help here. Burnside's lemma relates the number of orbits to the average number of fixed points.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to apply Burnside's lemma directly here.

Wait, another thought: the total number of ordered pairs (B, k) where B and B +k are disjoint is the sum over k of the number of B where B and B +k are disjoint, which is:

sum_{k=0}^7 N_k = 1 + 47 + 49 + 47 + 81 + 47 + 49 + 47.

Calculating this:

1 + 47 = 48

48 +49=97

97 +47=144

144 +81=225

225 +47=272

272 +49=321

321 +47=368.

So, total ordered pairs: 368.

But each subset B can be counted multiple times here, depending on how many k's satisfy the condition for B.

Let me denote the number of subsets B as 256. For each B, let t(B) be the number of k's such that B and B +k are disjoint. Then, the total number of ordered pairs is sum_{B} t(B) = 368.

But our goal is to find the number of B where t(B) ≥ 1, which is N.

But since sum_{B} t(B) = 368, and we know that N ≤ 256, but 368 is larger than 256, which makes sense because some B's are counted multiple times.

Wait, actually, each B can be counted multiple times, depending on how many k's satisfy the condition. So, the average t(B) is 368 / 256 ≈ 1.4375.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute N using inclusion-exclusion.

The inclusion-exclusion principle says that N = sum_{k=0}^7 N_k - sum_{k < l} N_{k,l} + sum_{k < l < m} N_{k,l,m} } - ... + (-1)^{7} N_{0,1,2,...,7}}.

Where N_{k1, k2, ..., kr} is the number of subsets B where B and B +k are disjoint for all ki in the set.

But this seems complicated because we'd have to compute all these terms.

But perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, considering that the problem is symmetric, perhaps we can find the number of B that are fixed by some non-zero shift. Wait, no, not exactly. Because we're looking for B such that B and B +k are disjoint, not that B is fixed by a shift.

Wait, maybe another approach: the total number of ordered pairs (B, k) is 368. But each B can be paired with multiple k's. So, to find N, the number of B with at least one k, we can think of it as the sum over B of 1 if t(B) ≥ 1, else 0.

But perhaps it's better to compute the total number of B such that there exists at least one k where B and B +k are disjoint.

Wait, perhaps using Möbius inversion on the group Z8.

Wait, I'm not too familiar with that, but perhaps another approach.

Wait, perhaps for each possible subset B, the number of k's where B and B +k are disjoint is equal to the number of k's such that B is a subset of V \ (B +k).

Which is equivalent to saying that the characteristic function of B, when convolved with itself, has a certain property.

Wait, maybe that's overcomplicating.

Wait, let's consider that the condition B ∩ (B +k) = empty is equivalent to B being a subset of V \ (B +k), which is equivalent to B ⊆ (V \ B) + (-k).

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: consider that the condition B and B +k being disjoint is equivalent to the characteristic function of B, say χ_B, satisfying χ_B * χ_B (k) = 0, where * denotes the convolution.

Wait, the convolution χ_B * χ_B (k) equals the number of ways to write k as i - j where i and j are in B. So, if this is zero for some k, then there are no such pairs (i, j) with j = i -k, so B and B +k are disjoint.

Wait, but maybe that's not helpful here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a graph. Each vertex corresponds to a possible subset B, and edges correspond to k's where B and B +k are disjoint. But that seems too abstract.

Alternatively, perhaps think in terms of linear algebra. Each subset can be represented as a vector in a vector space over GF(2), and the condition might relate to orthogonality. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe let's try to compute the number of B that are fixed by some non-zero shift k, but that's not exactly what we're looking for. Wait, but perhaps for each k, the number of B where B and B +k are disjoint is N_k as before, which for k=0 is 1, and for others is 47, 49, etc.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is symmetric, and the only B's that are counted for multiple k's are those that are symmetric in some way.

Wait, for example, the empty set is counted for all k, since shifting the empty set gives the empty set, which is disjoint with itself only if it's empty. So, the empty set is counted for all 8 k's.

Similarly, the full set V (all red) would only be counted for k=0, because shifting the full set would result in the full set again, so only when k=0 would B and B +k be disjoint (since B is empty only when k=0, but wait, no, the full set can't be empty. Wait, no, the full set is all red, so B is empty. Wait, no, if B is the full set, then B +k is the full set as well, so their intersection is the full set, not empty. So, the full set is never counted.

Wait, the empty set is the only B where B and B +k are disjoint for all k, because shifting the empty set gives the empty set, which is disjoint with itself (since empty set and empty set are disjoint).

Wait, so the empty set is counted 8 times in the sum of N_k's.

Similarly, other subsets might be counted multiple times.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the number of B where t(B) ≥ 1 using inclusion-exclusion.

Let’s denote S as the set of shifts, S = Z8, |S|=8.

For any B, t(B) is the number of k in S such that B and B +k are disjoint.

We need to compute the number of B where t(B) ≥ 1.

Using inclusion-exclusion:

Number of B with t(B) ≥ 1 = sum_{k ∈ S} N_k - sum_{k < l} N_{k,l} + sum_{k < l < m} N_{k,l,m} } - ... + (-1)^{8-1} sum_{k1 < ... <k8} N_{k1,..,k8}}.

Where N_{k1,...,kr} is the number of B such that B and B +k_i are disjoint for each i=1,...,r.

But this seems difficult because computing all these terms would be complicated.

Wait, perhaps for each r, the number of ways that B is disjoint with B +k_i for each k_i in some subset of size r.

But perhaps the only possible non-zero terms are when the shifts k_i are such that the union of their shifts covers all the possible overlaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the only non-zero terms are when the shifts k_i are all zero, but that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps for r=1, we've already computed N_k as 1,47,49, etc.

For r=2, N_{k,l} is the number of B where B is disjoint with both B +k and B +l.

Hmm, but this seems too involved.

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. Let me think: for a subset B, the condition that there exists a rotation k such that B and B +k are disjoint is equivalent to saying that the subset B is a "rotating" set, meaning that its complement can be rotated to match it.

Wait, but perhaps not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for each possible shift k, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the problem is asking for the number of subsets B such that B is a subset of the complement of B +k for some k. So, B is contained within (V \ B) +k.

Which is equivalent to B being a subset of (V \ B) +k.

Which implies that B is a subset of the complement of B shifted by k.

Which can be rewritten as B + (-k) is a subset of V \ B.

Which is equivalent to B + (-k) ∩ B = empty set.

Wait, so the condition is that B and B + (-k) are disjoint. So, B is a subset of V \ (B + (-k)).

Wait, but this brings us back to the same condition.

Wait, perhaps another approach: consider that B is a subset of V, and we're looking for B such that B is contained in some translate of its complement.

Which is V \ B shifted by some k.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the number of such subsets B is equal to the number of pairs (B, k) where B is a subset of (V \ B) +k, divided by the number of k's that work for each B.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each possible B and see if there's a k such that B is contained in (V \ B) +k.

Which would mean that for each b in B, b = c +k for some c in V \ B.

Which implies that for each b in B, there exists a c in V \ B such that c = b -k.

Which implies that B is a subset of (V \ B) +k.

Which means that the set B is entirely contained within the shifted complement.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that for each B, the condition that there exists a k such that B is contained in (V \ B) +k is equivalent to B being contained in some translate of its complement.

Which seems like a covering condition.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the complement of B is V \ B, and if we can rotate V \ B such that it covers B, then B is contained within a shifted version of its complement.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think of small examples.

When B is empty, then it's trivially contained in any shifted version of its complement (which is V), so that's one subset.

When B has one element, say {0}, then the complement is V \ {0}. We need to find a k such that {0} is contained in (V \ {0}) +k.

Which is equivalent to 0 being in (V \ {0}) +k, so 0 = c +k for some c in V \ {0}.

Which implies that k = 0 - c. Since c is in V \ {0}, k can be any of the 7 elements except 0.

Wait, but for example, if k is 1, then (V \ {0}) +1 would be {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0}, which is V, so {0} is contained in V.

Wait, but in this case, for any B with one element, any k would work because the complement is V \ B, which when shifted by any k would still cover all elements except perhaps one, but since B has only one element, shifting the complement appropriately would cover it.

Wait, no, wait: For B = {0}, the complement is V \ {0} = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}.

Shifting this by k=1 gives {2,3,4,5,6,7,0}, which does include 0.

Similarly, shifting by k=2 gives {3,4,5,6,7,1}, which does not include 0. Wait, no, 1 +2=3, 2+2=4, etc. Wait, no, when you shift {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} by k=2, you get {3,4,5,6,7,1,2}. So, 0 is not in this shifted set. So, in this case, B = {0} is not contained in (V \ B) +2, because 0 is not in {3,4,5,6,7,1,2}.

Wait, so for B = {0}, the shifts k where B is contained in (V \ B) +k are those k where 0 is in (V \ B) +k, which is equivalent to 0 -k is in V \ B, which is 0 -k ≠ 0, so k ≠0.

So, for B = {0}, the k's that work are k=1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

Wait, but when k=2, then (V \ B) +2 = {3,4,5,6,7,1,2}, which does not contain 0. So, B = {0} is not a subset of that shifted set. So, the condition is not satisfied for k=2.

Wait, so perhaps my earlier conclusion is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think again. For B = {0}, to have 0 in (V \ B) +k, we need 0 = c +k for some c in V \ B, which implies that c = 0 -k. But c must be in V \ B, which is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}.

So, 0 -k must be in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, which implies that -k is in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, which implies that k is in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}.

Wait, but when k=2, then 0 - 2 = -2 mod 8 is 6, which is in V \ B, so 0 is in (V \ B) +2, because (V \ B) +2 includes 6 +2=8 mod 8=0.

Wait, so for k=2, 0 is indeed in (V \ B) +2, so B = {0} is contained in (V \ B) +2, because 0 is in that set.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that (V \ B) +2 would be {3,4,5,6,7,1,2}, which indeed includes 0? Wait, no, 6+2=8 mod8=0, so 0 is in (V \ B) +2.

Wait, so in that case, for B = {0}, all k ≠0 satisfy the condition that B is contained in (V \ B) +k.

So, for B = {0}, t(B) =7.

Similarly, for any singleton B = {i}, t(B) =7, because for any k ≠0, (V \ B) +k will include i.

Wait, because (V \ B) contains all except i. So, when shifted by k, it will include i if and only if there exists some c in V \ B such that c +k =i. So, c =i -k, which is in V \ B, so i -k ≠i, which implies that k≠0.

Thus, for any singleton B, t(B) =7.

Similarly, for a two-element set B, let's say B = {0,1}, then the complement is V \ B = {2,3,4,5,6,7}.

We need to find k such that {0,1} is a subset of (V \ B) +k.

Which means both 0 and 1 must be in (V \ B) +k.

So, 0 = c1 +k and 1 = c2 +k for some c1, c2 in V \ B.

Which implies that c1 =0 -k and c2 =1 -k, both in V \ B.

So, 0 -k and 1 -k must both be in {2,3,4,5,6,7}.

So, 0 -k ∈ {2,3,4,5,6,7} ⇒ k ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6}.

Similarly, 1 -k ∈ {2,3,4,5,6,7} ⇒ k ∈ {1-7, 1-6, ..., 1-2} mod8 ⇒ k ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6}.

Wait, so the possible k's are those where both 0 -k and 1 -k are in {2,3,4,5,6,7}.

Which is equivalent to 0 -k ≥2 ⇒ k ≤6.

And 1 -k ≥2 ⇒ k ≤-1 ⇒ k ≥7 mod8.

Wait, but 1 -k ≥2 mod8 ⇒ k ≤1 -2 ⇒ k ≤-1 ⇒ k=7 mod8.

Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps better to think numerically.

For B={0,1}, we need both 0 and 1 to be in (V \ B) +k.

Which is the same as both 0 and 1 being in {2,3,4,5,6,7} +k.

So, 0 ∈ {2 +k, 3 +k, 4 +k, 5 +k, 6 +k, 7 +k} mod8.

Similarly, 1 ∈ the same set.

So, for some k, both 0 and 1 must be in {2 +k, 3 +k, ...,7 +k}.

Which implies that 0 = c +k and 1 = d +k for some c, d in {2,3,4,5,6,7}.

Which implies that k ≡ -c mod8 and k ≡ -d mod8.

So, c ≡ d mod8.

Which implies that c = d, since they're both in {2,3,4,5,6,7} and distinct unless c=d.

Wait, but if c ≠d, then k cannot satisfy both conditions.

Thus, for B={0,1}, there's no k such that both 0 and 1 are in (V \ B) +k, because that would require c =d, which would imply that 0 and 1 are both in the shifted complement, but the shifted complement can't contain both 0 and 1 unless k is such that 0 and1 are both in {2 +k, 3 +k, ...,7 +k}.

Wait, let's try specific k's.

k=2: shifted complement is {4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3}.

So, {0,1} are both in this set. So, B={0,1} is contained in (V \ B) +2.

Similarly, k=3: shifted complement is {5,6,7,0,1,2,3,4}.

Again, {0,1} are in this set.

Similarly, k=4: shifted complement is {6,7,0,1,2,3,4,5}.

Again, {0,1} are present.

k=5: shifted complement is {7,0,1,2,3,4,5,6}.

Yes, contains 0 and1.

k=6: shifted complement is {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7} ⇒ same as V, so yes.

k=7: shifted complement is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0} ⇒ contains 0 and1.

k=1: shifted complement is {3,4,5,6,7,0,1,2} ⇒ contains 0 and1.

k=0: shifted complement is V \ B ⇒ {2,3,4,5,6,7}, which does not contain 0 or1.

So, for B={0,1}, all k except k=0 satisfy the condition. So, t(B) =7.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that perhaps the two-element set might not be possible, but clearly, it is.

Wait, so perhaps for any non-empty B, t(B) is 7, except when B is the full set or some other special cases.

Wait, let's check B = {0,2,4,6}. The complement is {1,3,5,7}.

We need to find k such that {0,2,4,6} is a subset of {1,3,5,7} +k.

So, for each element in B, it must be in {1,3,5,7} +k.

Which implies that 0 = a +k, 2 = b +k, 4 = c +k, 6 = d +k, where a, b, c, d are in {1,3,5,7}.

So, 0 = a +k ⇒ k = -a.

Similarly, 2 = b +k ⇒ 2 = b -a ⇒ b = a +2.

Similarly, 4 = c +k ⇒ 4 = c -a.

And 6 = d +k ⇒ 6 = d -a.

Now, a, b, c, d must all be in {1,3,5,7}.

So, let's see possible a:

If a=1, then b=3, c=5, d=7. So, k = -1 =7 mod8.

Check if 0=1 +7=8≡0 mod8.

2=3+7=10≡2 mod8.

4=5+7=12≡4 mod8.

6=7+7=14≡6 mod8.

Yes, that works. So, k=7 works.

Similarly, if a=3, then b=5, c=7, d=9≡1 mod8. But d=1 is in the complement, so that works as well.

So, k = -3 =5 mod8.

Check:

0=3 +5=8≡0.

2=5 +5=10≡2.

4=7 +5=12≡4.

6=1 +5=6.

Yes, that works.

Similarly, a=5 would give b=7, c=9≡1, d=11≡3.

k = -5=3 mod8.

Check:

0=5+3=8≡0.

2=7+3=10≡2.

4=1+3=4.

6=3+3=6.

Yes, works.

a=7 would give b=9≡1, c=11≡3, d=13≡5.

k=-7=1 mod8.

Check:

0=7+1=8≡0.

2=1+1=2.

4=3+1=4.

6=5+1=6.

Yes, works.

So, for B={0,2,4,6}, the shifts k=7,5,3,1 all work, so t(B)=4.

Wait, so this B has t(B)=4.

So, the number of k's where B and B +k are disjoint varies depending on B.

So, in this case, t(B)=4.

Hmm, so perhaps the earlier approach of using inclusion-exclusion is necessary.

But perhaps it's too time-consuming. Maybe I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps the only subsets B that are counted multiple times are those that are unions of entire orbits under some rotation.

Wait, for example, the subset B={0,2,4,6} is a union of two orbits under rotation by 2. So, when you shift by 2, it maps to itself. So, perhaps such subsets have higher t(B).

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to realize that the problem is equivalent to counting the number of B such that B is a subset of the complement of its own shift by some k.

Which is equivalent to saying that the characteristic function of B is orthogonal to its own shift by k, in some sense.

Wait, another thought: the number we're seeking is the number of B such that B is contained in the complement of its own rotation by some k, which is equivalent to saying that B is a subset of (V \ B) +k for some k.

This can be rewritten as B + (-k) is a subset of V \ B.

Which is equivalent to (B + (-k)) ∩ B = empty.

So, B and B + (-k) are disjoint.

Which brings us back to the original condition.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of such subsets B is equal to the sum over k of the Möbius function times something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another angle: the probability we're looking for is the same as the probability that the subset B is a derangement under some rotation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's helpful to model this as a graph where each vertex represents a subset B, and edges connect subsets that are rotations of each other. Then, we're looking for the number of subsets B such that there's an edge from B to its complement.

Wait, but perhaps that's overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe another approach: for each possible rotation k, the number of subsets B where B and B +k are disjoint is N_k as computed earlier. So, sum_{k=0}^7 N_k =368.

But since each subset B is counted t(B) times, where t(B) is the number of k's such that B and B +k are disjoint, then the sum of t(B) over all B is 368.

So, if we denote N as the number of B with t(B) ≥1, then:

sum_{B} t(B) =368 = sum_{B} t(B) = sum_{B} [number of k where B and B +k are disjoint}.

We can write this as:

368 = sum_{B} t(B) = sum_{B} [number of k where B and B +k are disjoint}.

But we can also write:

sum_{B} t(B) = sum_{k} N_k =368.

But to find N, the number of B with t(B) ≥1, perhaps we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion as follows:

N = sum_{k} N_k - sum_{k < l} N_{k,l} + sum_{k < l < m} N_{k,l,m}} - ... + (-1)^{7} N_{0,1,2,...,7}.

But computing all these terms seems difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the only non-zero terms in inclusion-exclusion are when the shifts are compatible in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps the only non-zero term is when the shifts are all 0, but that's trivial.

Wait, perhaps using Möbius inversion on the group Z8.

Wait, consider the group Z8 acting on the subsets of V via translation. Then, the number of subsets B fixed by some non-identity element would be counted, but that's not exactly our case.

Wait, but perhaps the number we’re looking for is the number of subsets B such that the stabilizer of B under the group action is non-trivial. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of subsets B with non-trivial stabilizer under the group action is equal to the number of B where there's a non-zero k such that B +k = B.

But again, that's not exactly our condition.

Wait, perhaps it's better to go back to the original problem and think of it as follows:

Each vertex is colored red or blue with probability 1/2, independently. We need the probability that there exists a rotation k such that all blue vertices are mapped to red vertices.

Which is equivalent to saying that the set of blue vertices B is a subset of the red vertices R after rotation by k. Since R is V \ B, then B must be a subset of (V \ B) +k.

Which is the same as B ⊆ (V \ B) +k.

Which is equivalent to B + (-k) ⊆ V \ B.

Which implies that B + (-k) and B are disjoint.

So, this brings us back to the original condition.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the number of such subsets B is equal to the number of orbits under the group action that are symmetric in some way.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the size of the orbit.

Wait, each subset B has an orbit size equal to the size of the group divided by the stabilizer. So, the orbit size is 8 / s, where s is the size of the stabilizer.

But I'm not sure how this helps.

Wait, another thought: if a subset B is such that B and B +k are disjoint for some k ≠0, then B cannot be invariant under any non-zero shift. So, perhaps the subsets B that are fixed by some non-zero shift are those where B is a union of entire orbits under that shift.

Wait, so if a subset B is fixed under a shift by k, then it must be a union of cycles in the permutation induced by shifting by k.

So, for example, if k=2, then the cycles are {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7}. So, B can be any subset that is a union of some cycles.

Similarly, for k=1, the cycles are a single 8-cycle, so B can only be the empty set or the full set to be fixed by the shift.

Wait, but in our problem, we're looking for B where B and B +k are disjoint, not where B is fixed by the shift.

So, perhaps the stabilizer idea isn't directly applicable.

Wait, perhaps the number of B such that B is contained in some translate of its complement is equal to the number of B that are "complemented" by some shift.

Wait, but I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to compute N directly, I can think of the total number of ordered pairs (B, k) where B and B +k are disjoint, which we've found to be 368.

But we need to find the number of B where there exists at least one k such that this holds.

So, using the inclusion-exclusion principle:

N = sum_{k=0}^7 N_k - sum_{k < l} N_{k,l} + sum_{k < l < m} N_{k,l,m}} - ... + (-1)^7 N_{0,1,2,...,7}.

But computing all these terms is difficult, so perhaps we can find that for r ≥2, N_{k1,...,kr} = 0 or some pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the only non-zero terms are for r=1 and r=8.

Wait, for r=8, the only case where all shifts k=0,1,2,...,7 satisfy B and B +k are disjoint is when B is empty. Because if B is non-empty, then for some k, B and B +k must overlap. So, N_{0,1,2,...,7} is 1 (only B=empty set).

Similarly, for r=2, N_{k,l} is the number of B where B and B +k are disjoint and B and B +l are disjoint.

But I'm not sure how to compute this.

Wait, perhaps for any two different shifts k and l, the number of B where B is disjoint with both B +k and B +l is equal to the number of B where B is a subset of (V \ B) +k and (V \ B) +l.

Which would imply that B is a subset of the intersection of (V \ B) +k and (V \ B) +l.

Which would require that (V \ B) +k and (V \ B) +l have a non-empty intersection.

Wait, perhaps for k ≠ l, the intersection (V \ B) +k ∩ (V \ B) +l is non-empty only if l -k is a multiple of the shift that leaves (V \ B) invariant.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps for the shifts k and l, if l = 2k, then the condition B and B +k are disjoint and B and B +l are disjoint would imply that B is contained in (V \ B) +k and (V \ B) +l.

Which would require that B is a subset of the intersection of these two shifted complements.

But I'm not making progress.

Perhaps another approach: since the problem is about probability, maybe it's better to compute the probability that such a rotation exists, and then express it as m/n.

But I'm stuck on finding N, the number of valid B's.

Wait, perhaps another idea: for a given B, the number of k's where B and B +k are disjoint is equal to the number of k's where B is contained in (V \ B) +k.

Which is equivalent to B being a subset of the union of (V \ B) +k for some k.

Wait, but perhaps this is not helpful.

Wait, maybe an alternative approach is to model this as a graph where each vertex is a subset B, and edges represent the condition of being disjoint under some shift. But this seems too abstract.

Wait, perhaps the problem is symmetric, and the only B's that satisfy the condition for multiple k's are those that are unions of entire orbits under some rotation.

Wait, for example, the empty set works for all k, as we saw. Similarly, the full set works only for k=0.

Wait, but when B is a union of entire orbits under some rotation, perhaps it works for multiple k's.

Wait, for example, B could be a union of orbits under rotation by 2, which splits the octagon into two cycles of length 4 each. So, B could be one of these cycles.

Wait, for example, B = {0,2,4,6}. Then, as we saw earlier, there are 4 shifts k where B and B +k are disjoint.

Similarly, other unions of entire orbits would have t(B) equal to the number of shifts that align their orbits.

But I'm not sure how this helps in counting N.

Wait, perhaps the number of B where t(B) ≥1 is equal to the sum over all possible non-empty shift subgroups of the number of subsets that are unions of entire orbits under that subgroup.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps the total number of B where t(B) ≥1 is equal to the sum over d |8 of φ(d) * 2^{8/d} -1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, this might not be the right approach.

Wait, another thought: for each possible shift k, the number of B where B and B +k are disjoint is N_k, which we've computed.

The total number of B where there exists some k is the union over all N_k. So,

|∪_{k=0}^7 N_k| = sum_{k=0}^7 |N_k| - sum_{k < l} |N_k ∩ N_l| + sum_{k < l < m} |N_k ∩ N_l ∩ N_m}| - ... + (-1)^7 |N_0 ∩ N_1 ∩ ... ∩ N_7}|.

But computing all these intersection terms is difficult.

But perhaps we can find a pattern or use Möbius inversion.

Wait, another approach: for each shift k, N_k = number of B where B and B +k are disjoint, which we've computed as:

k=0:1

k=1,3,5,7:47

k=2,6:49

k=4:81

So, sum_{k=0}^7 N_k =1 +4*47 +2*49 +81 =1 + 188 + 98 +81= 368, as before.

Now, the inclusion-exclusion formula for the union is:

|∪ N_k| = sum |N_k| - sum |N_k ∩ N_l| + sum |N_k ∩ N_l ∩ N_m}| - ... 

But to compute this, we need to know |N_k ∩ N_l| for all k < l.

But perhaps for certain pairs (k, l), |N_k ∩ N_l| can be computed as the number of B where B is disjoint with both B +k and B +l.

Which is equivalent to B being a subset of both (V \ B) +k and (V \ B) +l.

Which is equivalent to B being a subset of the intersection of (V \ B) +k and (V \ B) +l.

Which implies that (V \ B) +k ∩ (V \ B) +l is non-empty and contains B.

But perhaps this is too vague.

Wait, perhaps if k and l commute, i.e., if k and l are such that shifting by k then l is the same as shifting by l then k, then the intersection N_k ∩ N_l is the number of B where B is a subset of both (V \ B) +k and (V \ B) +l.

Which could be calculated as the number of B where B is a subset of the intersection of (V \ B) +k and (V \ B) +l.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the only way this works is if the shifts k and l generate a subgroup of Z8, and B is a union of orbits under that subgroup.

Wait, for example, if k=1 and l=2, then the subgroup generated by 1 and 2 is Z8, so B would have to be the empty set.

Wait, but perhaps for shifts that are multiples, like k=2 and l=4, the subgroup generated is {0,2,4,6}, so B would have to be a union of orbits under this subgroup.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the number of B where B and B +k are disjoint and B and B +l are disjoint is equal to the number of B that are unions of orbits under the subgroup generated by k and l.

But this is getting too abstract.

Wait, perhaps it's better to make an approximation. Since the problem is about probability, and considering that the answer is m/n with small m and n, perhaps the probability is 1/256 or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps after considering all possibilities, the answer is 1/64, and m +n=65, but I'm not certain.

Wait, no, that seems too low.

Wait, perhaps the number of valid B is 1 (empty set) + 8 (singletons) + ... but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the number of B where there exists a k such that B and B +k are disjoint is equal to the number of B where B is a subset of (V \ B) +k for some k.

Which is equivalent to the complement of B containing a translate of B.

So, the complement of B must contain a shifted version of B.

Which is equivalent to B being a subset of some translate of its complement.

Wait, perhaps this is the same as saying that B is a "shifted" subset of its complement.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the number of such subsets B is 81, as for k=4, but that's only when B is a subset of its complement shifted by 4.

Wait, but no, because for other k's, the number is different.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the number of subsets B where B is contained in some translate of its complement is equal to 81 +47 +49 + ... but that's just the same as the sum we did earlier, which is 368, but that counts ordered pairs, not unique B's.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern or formula.

Wait, perhaps the number of subsets B where there's some k such that B and B +k are disjoint is equal to 81 + 47*4 +49*2 - something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: the empty set is counted once, and for each singleton, they are counted 7 times. There are 8 singletons, so 8*7=56. For two-element sets, perhaps each is counted a certain number of times. But this approach might not be tractable.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the total number of B as follows:

The empty set:1

Singletons:8

Two-element sets: C(8,2)=28

Three-element sets: C(8,3)=56

Four-element sets: C(8,4)=70

Five-element sets: C(8,5)=56

Six-element sets: C(8,6)=28

Seven-element sets: C(8,7)=8

Eight-element set:1

Total:256.

Now, for each size, compute how many B's of that size satisfy the condition.

But this seems time-consuming, but perhaps manageable.

Let's start with size 0: B is empty. Then, for any k, B and B +k are empty and disjoint. So, N includes the empty set.

Size 1: B has one element, say {i}. As we saw earlier, for any k ≠0, B and B +k are disjoint. So, for each singleton, there are 7 k's. So, each singleton is counted 7 times in the sum of N_k's.

So, for size 1, number of B's:8, each contributing 7 to the sum.

Now, size 2: Let's consider B with two elements. As we saw earlier, for B={0,1}, t(B)=7, as there are 7 k's where B and B +k are disjoint.

Wait, but wait, when B has two elements, does t(B) always equal 7?

Wait, earlier with B={0,1}, t(B)=7, but for B={0,2}, what is t(B)?

Let me check.

B={0,2}, complement is {1,3,4,5,6,7}.

We need k such that B and B +k are disjoint.

Which means 0 and 2 are not in B +k.

So, 0 ∉ B +k and 2 ∉ B +k.

Which means that for some k, 0 and 2 are not in {b +k | b ∈ B}.

Which is equivalent to 0 and 2 ∉ {b +k}.

Which means that for some k, 0 ∉ B +k and 2 ∉ B +k.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of k such that B and B +k are disjoint.

So, for B={0,2}, the shifts k where {0,2} and {k, k+2} are disjoint.

So, we need {0,2} ∩ {k, k+2} = empty.

Which implies that k ≠0,2,6, etc. Wait, let's check specific k's.

k=1: B +1 = {1,3} → disjoint with {0,2} → yes.

k=3: B +3 = {3,5} → disjoint → yes.

k=4: B +4={4,6} → disjoint? No, because 6 is in B +4, and 6 is not in B. Wait, B is {0,2}, so 6 is not in B, so B +4 is {4,6}, which is disjoint with B.

Wait, actually, 4 is not in B, 6 is not in B, so yes, disjoint.

Wait, similarly, k=5: B +5={5,7} → disjoint.

k=6: B +6={6,0} → 0 is in B, so not disjoint.

k=7: B +7={7,1} → disjoint.

So, for B={0,2}, the k's where B and B +k are disjoint are k=1,3,4,5,7. So, t(B)=5.

Wait, so for some two-element sets, t(B)=5.

Wait, but earlier for B={0,1}, t(B)=7. So, it varies depending on the set.

This complicates the calculation, as different B's of the same size can have different t(B).

So, perhaps it's not feasible to compute the number of B's of each size that satisfy the condition.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find the total number N by noting that the average t(B) is 368 /256 = 1.4375.

But since the problem is symmetric, perhaps the number of B's with t(B) ≥1 is equal to the total number of B's minus those with t(B)=0.

Wait, but how many B's have t(B)=0?

A B with t(B)=0 would be such that for every k, B and B +k are not disjoint, i.e., B ∩ (B +k) is non-empty for all k.

Which means that for every shift k, B shares at least one element with its own shift by k.

Such sets B are called "fixing sets" or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps these are the B's that intersect every shift of themselves.

Wait, but how many such B's are there?

Wait, for example, the full set V would have t(B)=0, because shifting it would result in the same set, and their intersection is the full set, not empty.

Similarly, the empty set has t(B)=8, as we saw.

Now, for B of size 1, as we saw earlier, t(B)=7, so they are included.

For B of size 2, as in B={0,2}, t(B)=5, so included.

Wait, perhaps the only B's with t(B)=0 are those where B is the full set or some other specific sets.

Wait, but the full set is the only B where t(B)=0, because for any non-full B, there exists some k where B and B +k are disjoint.

Wait, is that true?

Wait, for example, take B = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, which is the full set. Then, for any k, B +k = B, so B ∩ (B +k) = B, which is not empty. So, t(B)=0.

What about B of size 7? Let's say B = V \ {0}.

Then, for k=1, B +1 = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0} ⇒ which is V, which shares all elements with B. So, their intersection is B, which is non-empty.

Wait, but for k=0, B and B are the same, so their intersection is B, non-empty.

But for k=0, the condition is that B and B are disjoint, which only happens when B is empty. So, for k=0, t(B)=0 only when B is empty.

Wait, for B of size 7, is there any k where B and B +k are disjoint?

Let me check.

B = V \ {0} = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}.

We need to find k such that B and B +k are disjoint.

Which would require that {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} and {k+1, k+2, ..., k+7} are disjoint.

But since B has 7 elements, and the shifted B would also have 7 elements. The only way they are disjoint is if every element in B is shifted outside of B, which is impossible because the octagon is cyclic. So, for B of size 7, there is no k where B and B +k are disjoint. So, t(B)=0.

Similarly, for any B where |B|=7, t(B)=0.

Similarly, for |B|=1, t(B)=7.

For |B|=2, some have t(B)=5, others might have different counts.

Wait, so the only B's with t(B)=0 are those with |B|=7 and |B|=8.

So, the number of B's with t(B)=0 is C(8,7) +1=8 +1=9.

So, the number of B's with t(B) ≥1 is 256 -9=247.

Wait, that would make the probability 247/256.

But 247 and 256: let's see if they are coprime.

256 is 2^8.

247 ÷13=19. So, 247=13*19.

256 is 2^8.

So, gcd(247,256)=1.

Thus, m=247, n=256, m +n=247+256=503.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here.

Because earlier, I thought that B's with |B|=2 can have t(B)≥1, but in the case of |B|=7, t(B)=0, which we accounted for.

But wait, is that correct?

Wait, for B of size 7, there is no k where B and B +k are disjoint. Similarly, for B of size 8, t(B)=0.

So, the number of B's with t(B)=0 is 9.

Thus, the number of B's with t(B)≥1 is 256 -9=247.

Thus, the probability is 247/256.

But wait, let me verify this.

Because earlier, I thought that for B of size 2, t(B) can be 5, which is ≥1, so they are included.

Similarly, for B of size 3, perhaps t(B) can be non-zero.

But according to this logic, only B's of size 7 and 8 have t(B)=0.

But is that accurate?

Wait, let me test with B of size 3.

Take B={0,1,2}.

We need to find k where B and B +k are disjoint.

Which would require that {0,1,2} and {k, k+1, k+2} are disjoint.

Which would require that the shifted set doesn't include any of 0,1,2.

So, let's find such k.

k=3: B +3 = {3,4,5}.

Which is disjoint with B, since B is {0,1,2}.

So, t(B) ≥1.

Similarly, for any B of size 3, there exists a k where B and B +k are disjoint.

Thus, the only B's with t(B)=0 are those with |B|=7 and 8.

So, the number of such B's is 8 (size 7) +1 (size 8)=9.

Thus, the number of B's with t(B)≥1 is 256-9=247.

So, the probability is 247/256.

But I'm not sure if this is correct because I might have missed some cases where t(B)=0 for other sizes.

Wait, let's test B of size 4.

Take B={0,1,2,3}.

Can we find a k where B and B +k are disjoint?

Let's try k=4: B +4 = {4,5,6,7}, which is disjoint with B. So, t(B) ≥1.

Similarly, for any B of size 4, there exists a k where B and B +k are disjoint.

Thus, only B's with sizes 7 and 8 have t(B)=0.

Thus, N=256-9=247.

Thus, the probability is 247/256.

But wait, 247 and 256 are coprime? Let's check.

256 ÷247=1 R9.

247 ÷9=27 R4.

9 ÷4=2 R1.

4 ÷1=4 R0.

So, gcd(247,256)=1.

Thus, m=247, n=256, m +n=503.

But wait, let's check with another B of size 4.

Take B={0,2,4,6}.

We saw earlier that t(B)=4. So, it's included.

Another B of size 4: {0,1,2,3}. As above, t(B)=1 (k=4).

So, it's included.

Thus, the only B's excluded are those of size 7 and 8.

Thus, the probability is 247/256, and m +n=503.


To solve the problem, we analyze the probability that a randomly colored regular octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices align with original red vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue with equal probability, resulting in \(2^8 = 256\) possible colorings.

We need to determine the number of colorings \(B\) for which there exists a rotation \(k\) such that \(B\) and \(B + k\) are disjoint, i.e., \(B \cap (B + k) = \emptyset\). This condition implies that \(B\) can be rotated to match the red vertices.

### Key Steps:

1. **Empty Set and Full Set**:
   - The empty set \(B = \emptyset\) satisfies the condition for all \(k\), as shifting an empty set results in an empty set, which is trivially disjoint with itself.
   - The full set \(B = V\) (all vertices blue) cannot satisfy the condition for any \(k \neq 0\), as shifting the full set results in the same full set, which overlaps entirely with itself.

2. **Single-Element Sets**:
   - For any singleton set \(B = \{i\}\), there are 7 valid rotations \(k\) (excluding \(k = 0\)) that shift \(i\) to a red vertex.

3. **Sets of Size 7**:
   - Any set \(B\) with 7 elements (one red vertex) cannot satisfy the condition for any rotation \(k\), as shifting \(B\) will always overlap with itself, leaving no room for a disjoint shift.

4. **Sets of Other Sizes**:
   - For sets \(B\) with sizes 1 to 6 and 8, it is always possible to find at least one rotation \(k\) such that \(B\) and \(B + k\) are disjoint.

5. **Counting Valid Sets**:
   - The only sets that do not satisfy the condition are those of size 7 and 8, totaling \(8 + 1 = 9\) invalid sets.

6. **Valid Sets**:
   - The total number of valid sets is \(256 - 9 = 247\).

### Probability Calculation:
The probability is the number of valid sets divided by the total number of possible sets:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{247}{256}
\]
Since 247 and 256 are coprime, \(m = 247\) and \(n = 256\), leading to \(m + n = 247 + 256 = 503\).

### Final Answer:
\boxed{503}
