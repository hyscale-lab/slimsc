Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. The equations given are all logarithms base 2, which is good because it might make things a bit simpler. The goal is to find |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n. 

Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture.

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

Hmm. So each equation is a logarithm of a ratio of one variable over the product of the other two. Since all the logs are base 2, maybe I can convert these into exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2. Converting that, it becomes x / (y z) = 2^(1/2), which is sqrt(2). So x = y z * sqrt(2). Let me write that down:

x = y z * 2^(1/2)  ...(1)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3. Converting, y / (x z) = 2^(1/3). So y = x z * 2^(1/3). Let me note that:

y = x z * 2^(1/3)  ...(2)

Third equation: log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4. So z / (x y) = 2^(1/4), which implies z = x y * 2^(1/4). So:

z = x y * 2^(1/4)  ...(3)

Now I have three equations, each expressing one variable in terms of the other two and a power of 2. Maybe I can substitute these equations into each other to find expressions for x, y, z in terms that can be solved.

Let me see. From equation (1), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From equation (2), y is expressed in terms of x and z. But since equation (1) has x in terms of y and z, perhaps I can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to express x in terms of z and then substitute into equation (3), or something like that.

Wait, maybe it's better to express all variables in terms of one variable. Let me try expressing y and z in terms of x, then substitute back.

Wait, actually, maybe another approach. Let me take all three equations and express the ratios. Let me see:

From equation (1): x / (y z) = 2^(1/2)  ...(1a)

From equation (2): y / (x z) = 2^(1/3)  ...(2a)

From equation (3): z / (x y) = 2^(1/4)  ...(3a)

If I multiply all three equations together, I get:

(x / (y z)) * (y / (x z)) * (z / (x y)) = 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4)

Simplify the left side:

The numerator is x * y * z. The denominator is y z * x z * x y.

Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, each fraction:

First term: x/(y z)
Second term: y/(x z)
Third term: z/(x y)

Multiply them:

(x/(y z)) * (y/(x z)) * (z/(x y)) ) = (x * y * z) / (y z * x z * x y)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x y z

Denominator: y z * x z * x y = (y z)(x z)(x y) = x^2 y^2 z^2

Wait, no. Let me compute the denominator step by step:

(y z) * (x z) * (x y) = y z * x z * x y

Group the terms:

= (y * x * x) * (z * z) * y
Wait, no. Let me think in terms of exponents.

Each variable in the denominator:

x appears in two terms: x z and x y, so x^2

y appears in two terms: y z and x y, so y^2

z appears in two terms: y z and x z, so z^2

Wait, no. Let me see:

The denominator is (y z) * (x z) * (x y) 

= y * z * x * z * x * y

= x^2 y^2 z^2

So numerator is x y z, denominator is x² y² z². So the entire product is (x y z) / (x² y² z²) = 1/(x y z). 

So left side is 1/(x y z).

Right side: 2^(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4). Let me compute the exponent:

1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Common denominator is 12.

1/2 = 6/12

1/3 = 4/12

1/4 = 3/12

So sum is 6 + 4 + 3 = 13 over 12, so 13/12.

Therefore, 2^(13/12).

Putting it together:

1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12)

Which implies that x y z = 2^(-13/12)

Hmm, that's a useful equation. Let me write that:

x y z = 2^(-13/12)  ...(4)

Now, this relates the product of x, y, z. Maybe I can use this with the earlier equations.

Looking back at equation (1a): x/(y z) = 2^(1/2). Let me express x in terms of y and z: x = y z 2^(1/2). Similarly, equation (2a): y = x z 2^(1/3). Equation (3a): z = x y 2^(1/4).

Alternatively, maybe express each variable as a multiple of the product of the other two, and then substitute.

Alternatively, let me take equation (1a): x = y z * 2^(1/2). Let me plug this into equation (2a): y = (x z) * 2^(1/3). But x is y z 2^(1/2), so substituting:

y = (y z 2^(1/2)) * z * 2^(1/3) = y z² 2^(1/2 + 1/3) 2^(1/3)

Wait, let me compute the exponents:

2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) = 2^(1/2 + 1/3) = 2^(5/6).

So y = y z² * 2^(5/6). Hmm, so we can divide both sides by y (since y is positive, so not zero):

1 = z² * 2^(5/6)

So z² = 1 / (2^(5/6)) = 2^(-5/6)

Taking square roots:

z = 2^(-5/12) since z is positive.

So z = 2^(-5/12). Got that.

Now, let's find x and y.

From equation (1a): x = y z * 2^(1/2)

We know z is 2^(-5/12), so x = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2) 

Simplify the exponents:

-5/12 + 1/2 = -5/12 + 6/12 = 1/12, so x = y * 2^(1/12)

Similarly, from equation (2a): y = x z * 2^(1/3)

We have x = y * 2^(1/12), so plugging into equation (2a):

y = (y * 2^(1/12)) * z * 2^(1/3)

Again, z is 2^(-5/12), so:

y = y * 2^(1/12) * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3)

Simplify exponents:

2^(1/12 -5/12 + 1/3) 

Compute 1/12 -5/12 = -4/12 = -1/3

Then -1/3 + 1/3 = 0.

So y = y * 2^0 = y * 1.

So equation reduces to y = y, which is an identity. Hmm, that doesn't help us find y. So maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps use equation (3a): z = x y * 2^(1/4)

We have z = 2^(-5/12) and x = y * 2^(1/12). So substituting into equation (3a):

2^(-5/12) = (y * 2^(1/12)) * y * 2^(1/4)

Simplify the right side:

= y² * 2^(1/12 + 1/4)

Compute 1/12 + 1/4. 1/4 is 3/12, so total 4/12 = 1/3.

So right side is y² * 2^(1/3)

So equation becomes:

2^(-5/12) = y² * 2^(1/3)

Divide both sides by 2^(1/3):

2^(-5/12 - 4/12) [Wait, 1/3 is 4/12? No, 1/3 is 4/12? Wait 1/3 is approximately 0.333, which is 4/12? No, 4/12 is 1/3. So yes, 1/3 = 4/12.

Wait, no. 2^(-5/12) divided by 2^(1/3) is 2^(-5/12 - 4/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4).

So:

2^(-3/4) = y²

So y² = 2^(-3/4)

Take square roots:

y = 2^(-3/8) since y is positive.

So y = 2^(-3/8)

Now, with y known, and x = y * 2^(1/12), so substituting y:

x = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) 

Combine exponents:

-3/8 + 1/12. Let me find a common denominator, which is 24.

-3/8 = -9/24

1/12 = 2/24

So sum is (-9 + 2)/24 = -7/24

Thus, x = 2^(-7/24)

So now we have:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24)

z = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)

Wait, maybe writing all with denominator 24 for consistency.

x: -7/24

y: -9/24

z: -10/24

So x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-10/24)

Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|.

Let me compute this logarithm.

First, compute x⁴ y³ z²:

x⁴ = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)

y³ = (2^(-9/24))^3 = 2^(-27/24) = 2^(-9/8)

z² = (2^(-10/24))^2 = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6)

Multiply them together:

x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)

Adding exponents:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6

First, let's convert all to 24 denominators:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

So total exponent: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8

So x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-25/8)

Then log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8

The absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8

So m is 25, n is 8. They are coprime since 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1.

Thus, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.

I think that's the answer. Let me just quickly check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent calculations.

Wait, in equation (3a): z = x y * 2^(1/4). So plugging x and y:

z = (2^(-7/24)) * (2^(-9/24)) * 2^(1/4)

= 2^(-16/24) * 2^(6/24)

= 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-5/12), which matches what I had earlier. So that's correct.

And when I did x⁴ y³ z², exponents were:

x⁴: (-7/24)*4 = -28/24 = -7/6

y³: (-9/24)*3 = -27/24 = -9/8

z²: (-10/24)*2 = -20/24 = -5/6

Adding them: (-7/6 -9/8 -5/6) = (-7 -5)/6 + (-9/8) = (-12/6) + (-9/8) = (-2) + (-9/8) = (-16/8 -9/8) = -25/8. Correct.

So the calculation seems right. So the final answer is 25/8, so m + n = 33.


To solve the given system of logarithmic equations, we start by converting each equation from logarithmic to exponential form:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\) implies \(\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\), so \(x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}\).
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\) implies \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\), so \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\).
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\) implies \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\), so \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\).

Next, we multiply all three equations together:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4}
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{1}{x y z}
\]

Simplifying the right side:

\[
2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4} = 2^{13/12}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{x y z} = 2^{13/12} \implies x y z = 2^{-13/12}
\]

Using this result, we substitute back into the expressions for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). After solving, we find:

\[
x = 2^{-7/24}, \quad y = 2^{-3/8}, \quad z = 2^{-5/12}
\]

We then compute \(x^4 y^3 z^2\):

\[
x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-7/6}, \quad y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8}, \quad z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-5/6}
\]

Multiplying these together:

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6} = 2^{-25/8}
\]

Taking the logarithm base 2:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

The absolute value is:

\[
\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| = \frac{25}{8}
\]

Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), leading to \(m + n = 33\).

\(\boxed{33}\)
