Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions. The first condition is that a + b + c equals 300. The second condition is that a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b equals 6,000,000.

Hmm, let me break this down. I remember that when dealing with equations involving sums of variables and products, sometimes symmetric expressions can be useful. The first equation is straightforward: a + b + c = 300. The second equation looks a bit more complicated, but maybe I can rewrite it in a more manageable form.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is a product where one variable is squared and multiplied by another. So, for example, a²b and a²c are both terms where a is squared and multiplied by b and c respectively. Similarly for the others.

Maybe I can factor this somehow. Let me try to factor out some common terms. Let's see:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the entire expression becomes:
a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let me substitute these into the equation.

So, replacing each (b + c), (a + c), and (a + b) with their equivalents:
a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's an interesting form. Let me write that out:
300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

I can factor out the 300:
300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Dividing both sides by 300 to simplify:
a² + b² + c² - (a³ + b³ + c³)/300 = 20,000.

Wait, that doesn't look too helpful. Maybe another approach is better. Let me think about the original problem again.

Another idea: Maybe I can express the second equation in terms of a, b, c, and then use the first equation to find a relationship.

Wait, another thought: I know that in symmetric equations, sometimes setting two variables equal might help. But with three variables, that might not be enough. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the case where all three variables are equal. Let's see what happens if a = b = c.

If a = b = c, then from a + b + c = 300, we get 3a = 300, so a = 100. Then each of a, b, c is 100.

Let's compute the second equation in this case:
a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b
= 100²*100 + 100²*100 + 100²*100 + 100²*100 + 100²*100 + 100²*100
= 6 * 100^3
= 6 * 1,000,000
= 6,000,000.

Oh! So when a = b = c = 100, the second equation is satisfied. So at least one solution exists.

But the problem is asking for all possible triples (a, b, c). So the question is, are there other triples besides (100, 100, 100) that satisfy both conditions?

Wait, maybe all the variables have to be equal? Because if they aren't, perhaps the second equation won't hold. Let's test that.

Suppose, for example, that a = 100, b = 100, c = 100. Then it works. What if I change one variable slightly?

Say, a = 101, b = 100, c = 99. Then a + b + c = 300.

Now, let's compute the second equation.

Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Compute each term:

a²b = 101² * 100 = 10,201 * 100 = 1,020,100
a²c = 101² * 99 = 10,201 * 99 = Let's compute 10,201 * 100 = 1,020,100; subtract 10,201 gives 1,020,100 - 10,201 = 1,009,899
b²a = 100² * 101 = 10,000 * 101 = 1,
