Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have a 5x5 grid, which is 25 cells. We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable except for their color. The goal is to place some of these chips in the grid under certain conditions.

First, each cell can have at most one chip. That's straightforward, no overfilling cells. The second condition is that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same for columns. So, if I place a chip in a row, every other chip in that row must be the same color. Similarly for columns.

Wait, that means each row must be entirely one color or another, same with each column. Hmm, but that's a bit conflicting since a row's color affects the columns and vice versa.

The third condition is that any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions. So, the configuration must be maximal in the sense that you can't add another chip without breaking the row or column constraints.

So, the problem is essentially asking for the number of such maximal configurations. Let's break it down.

First, let's consider the structure of the grid. Since each row must be uniform in color, each row can either be all white, all black, or have no chips. Similarly, each column must be uniform in color, so each column can be all white, all black, or empty.

But wait, if all rows and columns are either all white, all black, or empty, how do these interact? Let me think. Suppose a row is all white. Then, every column that intersects this row must also be all white or have no chips. Because if any of those columns had a black chip, it would conflict with the white row.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. Let me correct that. If a row is all white, then each column that intersects this row could have a white chip or be empty. But if a column has a black chip, that black chip must be in a row that's all black. So, if a row is all white, then any column that has a black chip cannot intersect with that white row. That is, if a row is all white, then any column that is all black must be entirely in the other rows.

Similarly, if a column is all white, any row that is all black must be entirely in the other columns.

Hmm, this is getting a
