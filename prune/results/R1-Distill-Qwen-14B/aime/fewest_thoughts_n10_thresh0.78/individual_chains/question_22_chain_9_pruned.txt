Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, I remember that in such hexagons, especially convex equilateral ones with opposite sides parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as a combination of a smaller triangle and three parallelograms. Or maybe it's similar to a beehive cell structure, where each side is extended to form a larger triangle.

Wait, the problem says the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. So, maybe the hexagon is inscribed within this larger triangle, and each side of the hexagon is a portion of these extended sides. Since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are equal, and opposite sides are parallel, which probably means that the hexagon is similar in some way to the larger triangle.

I think I can model this using similar triangles. If I denote the side length of the hexagon as 's', then each side of the hexagon would correspond to a segment on the sides of the larger triangle. The larger triangle's sides are 200, 240, and 300. Maybe each side of the hexagon is a portion subtracted from these sides, but I'm not sure exactly how.

Let me try to visualize the hexagon inside the triangle. Each pair of opposite sides of the hexagon is parallel to the sides of the triangle. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Wait, no, the problem says all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, AB || DE, BC || EF, and CD || FA? Or is it AB || CD, BC || DE, EF || FA? Hmm, I might have gotten that wrong.

Actually, in a hexagon with opposite sides parallel, it's usually AB || DE, BC || EF, and CD || FA. So, each pair of opposite sides is parallel. So, if I'm extending AB, CD, and EF, those extensions would meet to form the larger triangle. That makes sense.

So, AB, CD, and EF are three sides of the hexagon, each of length 's'. When extended, they form a triangle with sides 200, 240, 300. So, the idea is that each of these sides (AB, CD, EF) is a part of the sides of the triangle, and the extensions beyond the hexagon complete the triangle.

Let me try to think of the triangle as being divided into smaller sections by the hexagon. Each side of the triangle is divided into two parts by the hexagon: one part is the side of the hexagon, and the other is the extension beyond the hexagon.

Wait, no, actually, each side of the triangle is formed by the extension of one side of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, each side of the triangle is formed by two extensions from the hexagon's sides.

Wait, maybe each side of the triangle is formed
