Okay, so I need to find the distance from a point inside a tetrahedron to each of its faces. The tetrahedron has specific edge lengths, and the point is equidistant from all four faces. Hmm, I remember that this point is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance is like the radius of the inscribed sphere, or the inradius.

First, let me note down the given edge lengths:

- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

So, the tetrahedron is such that opposite edges are equal. That must mean it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron. Maybe something like a "kite" but in three dimensions. I think these are called isosceles tetrahedrons or maybe disphenoids. Let me check that later.

I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area.

So, my plan is to compute the volume and the surface area, then use this formula to find r.

First, let's compute the surface area. Since each pair of opposite edges are equal, the faces might be congruent triangles.

Wait, let me see: each face is a triangle. Let me list the edges of each face.

Faces are:

- Face ABC: edges AB, BC, AC
- Face ABD: edges AB, BD, AD
- Face ACD: edges AC, CD, AD
- Face BCD: edges BC, CD, BD

Given the edge lengths:

AB = √41, AC = √80, BC = √89

Similarly, CD = √41, BD = √80, AD = √89

So, each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89. So all four faces are congruent triangles.

So, the surface area S is 4 times the area of one face.

So, I can compute the area of one face and multiply by 4.

Let me compute the area of triangle ABC with sides a = √41, b = √80, c = √89.

I can use Heron's formula for that.

First, compute the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

s = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2

But Heron's formula might be a bit messy with square roots. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, since all edges are given, perhaps I can compute the area using the coordinates method.

Wait, maybe I can assign coordinates to the tetrahedron vertices to make things easier.

Let me think. If I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system such that the centroid is at the origin, but maybe that's complicating.

Alternatively, I can set up the points so that opposite edges are equal. Maybe place the points such that midpoints align.

Wait, perhaps I can use vectors or coordinates. Let me try.

Let me denote the coordinates of the four points as follows:

Let’s place point A at (x, y, z), point B at (p, q, r), point C at (s, t, u), and point D at (v, w, m). Hmm, but that might get too complicated with so many variables.

Wait, another approach. Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron is symmetrical in some way, allowing me to assign coordinates more easily.

I recall that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it can be embedded in a coordinate system where the coordinates are symmetric.

Let me try to assign coordinates such that:

- A = (a, b, c)
- B = (-a, -b, c)
- C = (-a, b, -c)
- D = (a, -b, -c)

This setup often works for symmetrical tetrahedrons, ensuring that opposite edges are equal.

Let me check the distances between these points.

Compute AB:

A = (a, b, c), B = (-a, -b, c)

Distance AB: sqrt[(a + a)^2 + (b + b)^2 + (c - c)^2] = sqrt[(2a)^2 + (2b)^2 + 0] = sqrt(4a² + 4b²) = 2 sqrt(a² + b²)

Given AB = sqrt(41), so:

2 sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(41) => sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(41)/2 => a² + b² = 41/4.

Similarly, compute AC:

A = (a, b, c), C = (-a, b, -c)

Distance AC: sqrt[(a + a)^2 + (b - b)^2 + (c + c)^2] = sqrt[(2a)^2 + 0 + (2c)^2] = sqrt(4a² + 4c²) = 2 sqrt(a² + c²)

Given AC = sqrt(80), so:

2 sqrt(a² + c²) = sqrt(80) => sqrt(a² + c²) = sqrt(80)/2 => a² + c² = 80/4 = 20.

Similarly, compute AD:

A = (a, b, c), D = (a, -b, -c)

Distance AD: sqrt[(a - a)^2 + (b + b)^2 + (c + c)^2] = sqrt[0 + (2b)^2 + (2c)^2] = sqrt(4b² + 4c²) = 2 sqrt(b² + c²)

Given AD = sqrt(89), so:

2 sqrt(b² + c²) = sqrt(89) => sqrt(b² + c²) = sqrt(89)/2 => b² + c² = 89/4.

So now, we have three equations:

1. a² + b² = 41/4
2. a² + c² = 20
3. b² + c² = 89/4

Let me write them down:

1. a² + b² = 41/4
2. a² + c² = 20
3. b² + c² = 89/4

I can solve this system.

From equation 1: a² = 41/4 - b².

From equation 3: c² = 89/4 - b².

Substitute a² and c² into equation 2:

(41/4 - b²) + (89/4 - b²) = 20

Compute the left-hand side:

41/4 + 89/4 - 2b² = (41 + 89)/4 - 2b² = 130/4 - 2b² = 65/2 - 2b²

Set equal to 20:

65/2 - 2b² = 20

Convert 20 to 40/2:

65/2 - 40/2 = 2b²

25/2 = 2b² => b² = 25/4

So, b = 5/2 or -5/2, but since we're dealing with squares, sign doesn't matter.

Then, from equation 1: a² + (25/4) = 41/4 => a² = (41 -25)/4 = 16/4 =4. So a=2 or -2.

From equation 3: c² = 89/4 - 25/4 = 64/4 =16. So c=4 or -4.

So, now I can assign a=2, b=5/2, c=4.

Thus, the coordinates are:

A = (2, 5/2, 4)

B = (-2, -5/2, 4)

C = (-2, 5/2, -4)

D = (2, -5/2, -4)

Let me verify the distances to make sure.

Compute AB: distance between (2,5/2,4) and (-2,-5/2,4).

dx=4, dy= -5, dz=0.

Distance squared: 16 +25 +0=41. So AB=√41, correct.

Compute AC: distance between (2,5/2,4) and (-2,5/2,-4).

dx=4, dy=0, dz=8.

Distance squared: 16 +0 +64=80. So AC=√80, correct.

Compute AD: distance between (2,5/2,4) and (2, -5/2, -4).

dx=0, dy= -5, dz= -8.

Distance squared: 0 +25 +64=89. So AD=√89, correct.

Good, so the coordinates are correctly assigned.

Now
