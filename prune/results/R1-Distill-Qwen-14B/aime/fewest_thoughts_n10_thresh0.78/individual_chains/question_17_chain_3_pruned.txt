Okay, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes with a fixed surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q and find p+q. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that for a rectangular box with sides a, b, c, the surface area (SA) is 2(ab + bc + ac), and the volume (V) is abc. The problem says the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23. So, I can write those as equations:

2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 => ab + bc + ac = 27

and

abc = 23.

I need to find the minimal sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere must enclose the box entirely, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least equal to the space diagonal of the box. That makes sense because the space diagonal is the longest distance between any two vertices of the box.

The space diagonal d of a box with sides a, b, c is given by the formula:

d = √(a² + b² + c²)

So, the radius r of the sphere must be at least half of d, so:

r = d / 2 = √(a² + b² + c²) / 2

Therefore, r² = (a² + b² + c²) / 4

So, my goal is to minimize a² + b² + c², given the constraints ab + bc + ac = 27 and abc = 23.

Wait, but actually, no. Because the sphere has to contain the box regardless of the box's dimensions, as long as they satisfy the surface area and volume constraints. So, I think I need to find the minimal possible value of (a² + b² + c²) among all possible triples (a, b, c) satisfying the given SA and V. That way, the minimal r² would be achieved when a² + b² + c² is minimized.

So, how do I minimize a² + b² + c² with the given constraints?

I recall that for optimization problems with constraints, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Alternatively, maybe there's an inequality that relates a² + b² + c² to ab + bc + ac.

Wait, I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). Since ab + bc + ac is 27, this becomes (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 54. So, if I can find (a + b + c), then I can find a² + b² + c².

But how? I don't have a + b + c, but I do have abc = 23. Maybe I can relate a, b, c through their symmetric sums.

Let me denote:

S = a + b + c,

P = ab + bc + ac = 27,

T = abc = 23.

So, I know that for a cubic equation with roots a, b, c, the equation would be x³ - Sx² + Px - T = 0, which in this case is x³ - Sx² + 27x - 23 = 0.

But I'm not sure how that helps directly. Maybe I need to find S in terms of the given constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the AM-QM inequality or other inequalities to find a lower bound for a² + b² + c².

I recall that a² + b² + c² ≥ (ab + bc + ac) * (2/3) * 3? Wait, no, wait. Let me think about it correctly.

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality says that (a² + b² + c²)(1 + 1 + 1) ≥ (a + b + c)².

So, 3(a² + b² + c²) ≥ S².

But from earlier, we have S² = a² + b² + c² + 54.

So, substituting:

3(a² + b² + c²) ≥ (a² + b² + c²) + 54

Which simplifies to:

2(a² + b² + c²) ≥ 54 => a² + b² + c² ≥ 27.

But wait, that's just from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, but does it hold? Because if a² + b² + c² is 27, then S² = 27 + 54 = 81 => S = 9. But is S=9 achievable? Because if a, b, c are all equal, then a = b = c. Let's see what happens if they are equal.

If a = b = c, then the surface area would be 6a² = 54 => a² = 9 => a = 3. Then, the volume would be 3³ = 27. But our volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, the box can't be a cube, but perhaps it's close.

Wait, so the minimal a² + b² + c² is at least 27, but in reality, since the volume is less than the cube case, maybe a² + b² + c² is greater than 27.

Hmm, maybe I need a better approach. Perhaps using Lagrange multipliers.

Let me set up the function to minimize: f(a, b, c) = a² + b² + c².

Subject to the constraints:

g(a, b, c) = ab + bc + ac = 27

and

h(a, b, c) = abc = 23.

So, we can use Lagrange multipliers with two constraints. The Lagrangian would be:

L = a² + b² + c² - λ(ab + bc + ac - 27) - μ(abc - 23)

Taking partial derivatives with respect to a, b, c, λ, μ and setting them to zero.

Compute ∂L/∂a:

2a - λ(b + c) - μ(bc) = 0

Similarly,

∂L/∂b:

2b - λ(a + c) - μ(ac) = 0

∂L/∂c:

2c - λ(a + b) - μ(ab) = 0

And of course, the constraints:

ab + bc + ac = 27

abc = 23

So, now, we have a system of equations:

1) 2a = λ(b + c) + μ(bc)

2) 2b = λ(a + c) + μ(ac)

3) 2c = λ(a + b) + μ(ab)

4) ab + bc + ac = 27

5) abc = 23

Hmm, this looks complicated, but maybe we can find some symmetry here.

Suppose that a = b ≠ c. Let's test this case.

If a = b, then equations 1 and 2 should be the same, so let's see.

Let a = b = x, c = y.

Then, the constraints become:

x² + 2xy = 27

x² y = 23

So, from the first equation: x² + 2xy = 27 => x(x + 2y) = 27.

From the second equation: x² y = 23.

Let me solve for y from the second equation: y = 23 / x².

Substitute into the first equation:

x(x + 2*(23 / x²)) = 27

Simplify:

x^2 + (46 / x) = 27

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ + 46 = 27x

So,

x³ - 27x + 46 = 0

Hmm, let's try to find rational roots. Possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=2: 8 - 54 +46 = 0 → 0. So, x=2 is a root.

So, factor out (x - 2):

Using polynomial division or synthetic division.

Divide x³ -27x +46 by (x -2):

Coefficients: 1 0 -27 46

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 2: 2

Add to next coefficient: 0 +2=2

Multiply by 2:4

Add to next coefficient: -27 +4= -23

Multiply by 2: -46

Add to last coefficient:46 -46=0. So, remainder 0.

So, the polynomial factors as (x -2)(x² + 2x -23) =0.

Set to zero: x=2, or x² +2x -23=0.

Solving quadratic: x = [-2 ±√(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ±√96]/2 = [-2 ±4√6]/2 = -1 ±2√6.

Since x must be positive (as it's a length), so x=2 and x= -1 +2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898≈3.898.

So, possible x=2 and x≈3.898.

So, if x=2, then y=23/(2)^2=23/4=5.75.

Check if this gives a valid solution.

So, a = b=2, c=5.75.

Check if equations 1 and 2 are satisfied.

From equation 1: 2a = λ(b + c) + μ(bc)

So, 4 = λ(2 +5.75) + μ(2*5.75)

=> 4 = λ(7.75) + μ(11.5)

Similarly, equation 3: 2c = λ(a + b) + μ(ab)

So, 2*5.75 = λ(4) + μ(4)

11.5 =4λ +4μ

So now, we have two equations:

7.75 λ + 11.5 μ =4   ... (A)

4 λ +4 μ =11.5  ... (B)

Let me write these as:

Equation (A): 7.75 λ + 11.5 μ =4

Equation (B):
