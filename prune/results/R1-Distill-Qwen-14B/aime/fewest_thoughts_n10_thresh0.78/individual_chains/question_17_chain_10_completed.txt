Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I have a set of rectangular boxes, each with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then compute r squared, which will be a fraction p/q. Finally, I have to find p + q where p and q are coprime. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's recall what a rectangular box is. It's a three-dimensional figure with all faces being rectangles. So, the box has length, width, and height, which I can denote as x, y, and z respectively.

The problem gives me two constraints: surface area and volume.

The surface area (SA) of a rectangular box is given by the formula:
SA = 2(xy + yz + zx)
And the volume (V) is given by:
V = xyz

Given that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23, I can write the equations:
2(xy + yz + zx) = 54
and
xyz = 23

I need to find the dimensions x, y, z that satisfy these equations. Once I have the dimensions, I can determine the smallest sphere that can contain the box. The sphere must enclose the box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least as large as the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal (d) of a box with sides x, y, z is given by:
d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²)
Since the radius r is half the diameter, r = d/2 = sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2.

Therefore, r squared would be (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, my goal is to find the minimal possible value of (x² + y² + z²)/4 given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Wait, but I think actually, I need to find the maximum value of the space diagonal for all possible boxes in set B, because the sphere needs to contain all such boxes. So, the minimal radius that works for all boxes would correspond to the maximum space diagonal across all boxes in B, right?

Hmm, yes, that makes sense. So, to find the minimal sphere that can contain any box from set B, I need to find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B, then divide that by 2 for the radius.

So, first, I need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z² given the constraints 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here, but maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, I might consider using inequalities to relate the sum of squares and the sum of products. Let me think about that.

I know that (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx). From the surface area equation, 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, so xy + yz + zx = 27. Therefore, (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 54.

Hmm, but I don't know x + y + z. Maybe that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express x² + y² + z² in terms of S = x + y + z and P = xy + yz + zx. Since I know P = 27, and I might need S or some relation involving S.

Alternatively, maybe I can parameterize the problem. Let me assume that the box is such that two sides are equal, but I'm not sure if that's the case for the maximum space diagonal.

Wait, sometimes in optimization, symmetry can give the maximum or minimum. But in this case, perhaps the maximum space diagonal occurs when two variables are equal, or maybe when all three are equal. Wait, but if all three are equal, that would be a cube. Let me check if a cube is possible with the given surface area and volume.

If it's a cube, then x = y = z. Then surface area would be 6x² = 54, so x² = 9, so x = 3. Then volume would be x³ = 27, but the volume is given as 23, which is less than 27. So a cube isn't possible here. Therefore, the box can't be a cube, so symmetry might not help directly.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum space diagonal occurs when two sides are equal. Let me suppose x = y, and find z.

If x = y, then the surface area equation becomes 2(x² + 2xz) = 54. So, x² + 2xz = 27.

The volume equation is x² z = 23.

Let me denote x² z = 23, so z = 23 / x².

Plugging into the surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23 / x²) = 27
Simplify:

x² + (46 / x) = 27

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate denominator:

x³ + 46 = 27x

Bring all terms to one side:

x³ - 27x + 46 = 0

Hmm, let's try to solve this cubic equation. Maybe there's an integer root. Let's test x=2: 8 - 54 +46 = 0. Yep, x=2 is a root.

So, we can factor out (x - 2):

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide x³ - 27x + 46 by (x - 2):

Coefficients: 1 (x³), 0 (x²), -27 (x), 46.

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46
        2   4  -46
      1  2  -23  0

So, the cubic factors as (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23) = 0.

Set equal to zero:

x = 2, or x² + 2x -23 = 0.

Solving the quadratic:

x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)] / 2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)] / 2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6)

Since x is positive (as a length), we take x = -1 + 2√6 ≈ 3.449.

So, the possible solutions are x = 2 and x ≈ 3.449.

Wait, but in our assumption, x = y, so let's consider each case.

Case 1: x = y = 2.

Then z = 23 / (2)^2 = 23 / 4 = 5.75.

So, the sides are 2, 2, 5.75.

Compute the space diagonal: sqrt(2² + 2² + 5.75²) = sqrt(4 + 4 + 33.0625) = sqrt(41.0625) ≈ 6.409.

Case 2: x = y = -1 + 2√6 ≈ 3.449.

Then z = 23 / x². Let's compute x²:

x = (-1 + 2√6), so x² = 1 -4√6 + (2√6)^2 = 1 -4√6 + 24 = 25 -4√6.

So, z = 23 / (25 -4√6).

To rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

z = [23*(25 +4√6)] / [(25)^2 - (4√6)^2] = [575 + 92√6] / [625 - 16*6] = [575 + 92√6]/[625 -96] = [575 +92√6]/529.

Simplify denominator: 529 is 23², so that's 575 +92√6 over 529.

Wait, perhaps we can factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, 575 ÷23 is 25, since 23*25=575.

Similarly, 92 ÷23=4.

So, z = [23*(25 +4√6)] / (23²) = (25 +4√6)/23.

So, z = (25 +4√6)/23.

Therefore, the sides are approximately 3.449, 3.449, and (25 +4√6)/23 ≈ (25 +9.798)/23 ≈34.798/23≈1.513.

Wait, wait, but if x = y ≈3.449 and z≈1.513, then what's the space diagonal?

Compute x² + y² + z².

x² is (25 -4√6), as we had earlier.

So, x² + y² + z² = 2*(25 -4√6) + [(25 +4√6)/23]^2.

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I should compute numerically.

Compute x ≈3.449, so x²≈11.897.

Similarly, z≈1.513, so z²≈2.289.

So, x² + y² + z² ≈11.897 +11.897 +2.289≈26.083.

Therefore, the space diagonal is sqrt(26.083)≈5.107.

Wait, that's smaller than the diagonal in the first case where the space diagonal was ≈6.409.

So, in this case, when x and y are about 3.449 and z≈1.513, the space diagonal is smaller. So, the maximum space diagonal occurs in the first case, when x=y=2, z=5.75, giving a space diagonal of sqrt(41.0625)≈6.409.

But is that the maximum? Are there other cases where the space diagonal is larger?

Wait, perhaps not assuming x=y, but considering the general case.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum occurs when one of the sides is as large as possible, and the others are as small as possible, but given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Alternatively, perhaps to find the maximum of x² + y² + z² under the constraints 2(xy + yz +zx)=54 and xyz=23.

This seems like a constrained optimization problem, so maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers.

Let me set up the function f(x,y,z) = x² + y² + z², which we want to maximize.

Subject to the constraints:

g1(x,y,z) = 2(xy + yz + zx) -54 =0

g2(x,y,z) = xyz -23 =0

So, I can set up the Lagrangian:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ1*(2(xy + yz + zx) -54) - λ2*(xyz -23)

Then take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, and set them to zero.

Compute partial derivative with respect to x:

dL/dx = 2x - λ1*(2(y + z)) - λ2*(yz) =0

Similarly for y:

dL/dy = 2y - λ1*(2(x + z)) - λ2*(xz) =0

And for z:

dL/dz = 2z - λ1*(2(x + y)) - λ2*(xy) =0

So, we have the system of equations:

1) 2x - 2λ1(y + z) - λ2 yz =0

2) 2y - 2λ1(x + z) - λ2 xz =0

3) 2z - 2λ1(x + y) - λ2 xy =0

Plus the constraints:

4) 2(xy + yz + zx) =54

5) xyz =23

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can find a relationship between x, y, z.

Let me subtract equation 1 and equation 2:

[2x - 2λ1(y + z) - λ2 yz] - [2y - 2λ1(x + z) - λ2 xz] =0

Simplify:

2x -2y -2λ1(y + z - x - z) - λ2(yz -xz)=0

Simplify further:

2(x - y) -2λ1(y -x) -λ2 z(y -x)=0

Factor (x - y):

[2 + 2λ1 + λ2 z] (x - y)=0

So, either x = y, or 2 + 2λ1 + λ2 z =0.

Similarly, subtracting equation 1 and 3:

[2x - 2λ1(y + z) - λ2 yz] - [2z - 2λ1(x + y) - λ2 xy]=0

Simplify:

2x -2z -2λ1(y + z -x - y) -λ2(yz -xy)=0

Simplify:

2(x - z) -2λ1(z -x) -λ2 y(z -x)=0

Factor (x - z):

[2 + 2λ1 + λ2 y] (x - z)=0

So, either x = z, or 2 + 2λ1 + λ2 y=0.

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 and 3:

[2y - 2λ1(x + z) - λ2 xz] - [2z - 2λ1(x + y) - λ2 xy]=0

Simplify:

2y -2z -2λ1(x + z -x - y) -λ2(xz -xy)=0

Simplify:

2(y - z) -2λ1(z - y) -λ2 x(z - y)=0

Factor (y - z):

[2 + 2λ1 + λ2 x] (y - z)=0

So, either y = z, or 2 + 2λ1 + λ2 x=0.

So, from these, either two variables are equal, or the other terms are zero.

But assuming that variables are not all equal (since cube isn't possible here), perhaps two variables are equal.

Earlier, I considered x = y, which led to a solution. Alternatively, x = z or y = z may lead to other solutions.

But for the sake of simplicity, let's assume that two variables are equal, say x = y, and then proceed to solve.

We already did that earlier and found a solution where x = y =2, z=5.75. Then, another solution where x = y ≈3.449, z≈1.513.

Wait, but in the case where x = y, we have two possible solutions for x, but only one gives a positive z.

So, perhaps in the case x = y, the maximum space diagonal is achieved at x = y =2, z=5.75.

But is that the global maximum?

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when all three variables are different.

But solving the Lagrangian equations without assuming two variables are equal seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can bound the space diagonal.

Let me think about the possible values of x, y, z given the constraints.

Given that the volume is fixed at 23, and surface area at 54, perhaps I can find the maximum of x² + y² + z² under these constraints.

Alternatively, I can use the AM-QM inequality.

Wait, the QM (quadratic mean) is sqrt[(x² + y² + z²)/3], which is always greater than or equal to the GM (geometric mean), but I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or other inequalities.

Wait, perhaps I can express x² + y² + z² in terms of the given constraints.

Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + zx =27, and Q = xyz=23.

I know that x² + y² + z² = S² - 2P = S² -54.

So, x² + y² + z² = S² -54.

So, to maximize x² + y² + z², I need to maximize S².

So, I need to find the maximum possible value of S = x + y + z, given that P=27 and Q=23.

Is there a way to find the maximum S?

This seems like another optimization problem: maximize S = x + y + z given that xy + yz + zx=27 and xyz=23.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers again for this specific problem.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that for fixed P and Q, the maximum S occurs when two variables are equal. Because in symmetric situations, the extrema often occur at symmetric points or when some variables are equal.

So, let's assume that two variables are equal, say x = y, and find z.

Then, as before:

From P = x² + 2xz =27

From Q =x² z =23

So, z = 23 /x².

Substituting into P:

x² + 2x*(23/x²) =27

x² + (46/x) =27

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ +46 =27x

x³ -27x +46=0

We already solved this earlier and found roots at x=2 and x=(-1 ±2√6).

So, possible x values are 2 and -1 +2√6.

Since x must be positive, x=2 or x=-1 +2√6≈3.449.

So, when x=2, z=23/(2)^2=5.75.

So, S =x + y + z=2 +2 +5.75=9.75

When x=-1 +2√6≈3.449, z=23/x²≈1.513.

Then S≈3.449 +3.449 +1.513≈8.411.

So, S is larger in the first case where x=y=2, z=5.75, giving S=9.75.

Therefore, in this scenario, the maximum S is 9.75.

Thus, x² + y² + z² = S² -54 = (9.75)^2 -54.

Compute 9.75 squared:

9.75^2 = (9 + 0.75)^2 =9^2 + 2*9*0.75 +0.75^2=81 +13.5 +0.5625=95.0625.

So, x² + y² + z²=95.0625 -54=41.0625.

Which is exactly the case when x=y=2, z=5.75.

So, that gives a space diagonal of sqrt(41.0625)=6.409, and radius r=6.409/2≈3.2045.

But wait, in the other case where x≈3.449, y≈3.449, z≈1.513, we had x² + y² + z²≈26.083, which is much smaller.

So, this suggests that the maximum x² + y² + z² is 41.0625, achieved when x=y=2 and z=5.75.

Therefore, the maximum space diagonal is sqrt(41.0625)=6.409, and the radius r is half that, so r=6.409/2≈3.2045.

But let me confirm if this is indeed the maximum over all possible x, y, z.

Is there a possibility that when x, y, z are all different, we can get a higher x² + y² + z²?

Alternatively, can we have a configuration where one side is even longer than 5.75, making the space diagonal larger?

But to have a longer side, say z larger than 5.75, with x and y smaller, but keeping the surface area at 54 and volume at 23.

Let me try an example. Suppose z is 6, which is larger than 5.75.

Then, volume would be x*y*6=23 => x*y=23/6≈3.8333.

Surface area would be 2(xy + y*6 + x*6)=54.

Which is 2(3.8333 +6x +6y)=54.

Divide both sides by 2:

3.8333 +6x +6y=27.

So, 6x +6y=27 -3.8333≈23.1667.

Which is x + y≈23.1667 /6≈3.8611.

So, x + y≈3.8611 and x*y≈3.8333.

So, we can solve for x and y:

Let me denote S =x + y≈3.8611, P= x*y≈3.8333.

Then, the quadratic equation would be t^2 - S t + P=0.

So, t^2 -3.8611 t +3.8333=0.

Compute discriminant D=S² -4P≈(3.8611)^2 -4*3.8333≈14.909 -15.333≈-0.424.

Negative discriminant, so no real solutions. Therefore, when z=6, it's impossible to have real x and y satisfying the constraints.

So, z cannot be 6. So, the maximum possible z is when x and y are as small as possible, but still allowing real solutions.

Alternatively, perhaps the case where x=y=2, z=5.75 is indeed the case where the space diagonal is maximized.

Alternatively, perhaps when one of the sides is as large as possible, but I can't have a larger z without making the discriminant negative.

So, perhaps the maximum x² + y² + z² is indeed 41.0625, which is 41.0625= 41 + 1/16, since 0.0625=1/16.

Wait, 41.0625 is equal to 41 + 1/16= (41*16 +1)/16= (656 +1)/16=657/16.

Wait, 41.0625 *16=657, yes.

So, 41.0625=657/16.

So, x² + y² + z²=657/16.

Therefore, r²=(x² + y² + z²)/4= (657/16)/4=657/(16*4)=657/64.

Now, check if 657 and 64 are coprime. 64 is 2^6, and 657 is an odd number (since 657=656+1= even +1= odd). So, 657 is not divisible by 2. Let's check if 657 is divisible by 3: 6+5+7=18, which is divisible by 3, so 657 ÷3=219. Then 219 ÷3=73. So, 657=3^2 *73.

64 is 2^6, so no common factors. Therefore, 657 and 64 are coprime.

Thus, r²=657/64, so p=657, q=64. Then p+q=657+64=721.

Wait, but wait a second. When I assumed x=y, I found that x=2, y=2, z=5.75 gives x² + y² + z²=41.0625=657/16, which gives r²=657/(16*4)=657/64.

But earlier, when I thought of the space diagonal being sqrt(41.0625)=6.409, which would be the diameter, so radius is half that, which is 3.2045.

But I need to make sure that this is indeed the maximum. Is there a way to have a larger x² + y² + z² without assuming x=y?

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when one variable is as large as possible, but without violating the surface area and volume constraints.

But earlier, when I tried z=6, it didn't work because it made the discriminant negative. So, z can't be increased beyond a certain point.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parameterize the variables differently.

Let me think: perhaps express variables in terms of two parameters.

Let me let x = a, y = b, then z can be expressed from the volume equation: z=23/(ab).

Then, plug into the surface area equation:

2(ab + a z + b z) =54.

Substitute z=23/(ab):

2(ab + a*(23/(ab)) + b*(23/(ab)))=54

Simplify:

2(ab + 23/b +23/a)=54

Divide both sides by 2:

ab +23/b +23/a=27.

Hmm, so ab +23(1/a +1/b)=27.

This seems a bit complicated, but perhaps I can set u = a + b and v=ab.

Wait, but maybe it's better to let t = a + b and s=ab.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps let a = b, but that's the case we already considered.

Alternatively, perhaps let a and b vary and try to find maximum of x² + y² + z²= a² + b² + (23/(ab))².

Which would be f(a,b)=a² + b² + (529)/(a²b²).

But this seems quite complicated to maximize.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of substitution.

Let me set a = b, so x = y =a, then z=23/(a²).

Then, as before, the surface area equation becomes:

2(a² + 2a z)=54.

Which gives a² + 2a*(23/a²)=27.

So, a² +46/a=27.

Which is the same equation as before, leading to a=2 or a=-1+2√6.

So, in this case, the maximum x² + y² + z² is 41.0625.

Alternatively, perhaps if a ≠ b, then the x² + y² + z² is smaller.

Wait, but how do I know that? Maybe by using inequalities.

Is there a way to show that when a =b, the sum x² + y² + z² is maximized?

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers, but without assuming a = b.

But that might get too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for fixed ab and P=ab +23(1/a +1/b)=27, the sum a² + b² is minimized when a =b, which would in turn maximize z²=529/(a²b²)=529/(ab)^2.

Wait, if a =b, then ab is maximized for given a + b.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the function f(a,b)=a² + b² + (529)/(a²b²).

I want to maximize this function under the constraint ab +23(1/a +1/b)=27.

This seems complicated, but maybe I can take partial derivatives.

Alternatively, perhaps consider substituting variables.

Let me set u = a + b and v = ab.

Then, I know that a² + b² = u² - 2v.

So, f(a,b) = u² - 2v + (529)/(v²).

Also, from the constraint:

ab +23(1/a +1/b)=v +23*( (a + b)/(ab) )=v +23*(u/v)=27.

So, v + (23 u)/v =27.

Multiply both sides by v:

v² +23u=27v.

Rearranged: v² -27v +23u=0.

But this links u and v, but I'm not sure how to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps express u in terms of v:

From v² -27v +23u=0, we have u=(27v -v²)/23.

So, f(a,b) = u² -2v +529/v².

Substitute u=(27v -v²)/23:

f(v)=[(27v -v²)/23]^2 -2v +529/(v²)

Now, f(v) is a function of v alone.

But this seems quite complicated. Maybe I can find the derivative of f(v) and find its critical points.

But this might get too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use trial and error with different values of a and b to see if the sum a² + b² + z² can exceed 41.0625.

Wait, for example, let me choose a=1, then from the surface area equation:

ab +23(1/a +1/b)=27.

With a=1, equation becomes:

b +23(1 +1/b)=27.

Multiply both sides by b:

b² +23(b +1)=27b.

Simplify:

b² +23b +23=27b

b² -4b +23=0

Discriminant D=16 -92= -76 <0. No real solution.

So, a=1 is impossible.

How about a=3?

Then, equation becomes:

3b +23(1/3 +1/b)=27.

Multiply by 3b:

9b² +23(b +3)=81b.

Simplify:

9b² +23b +69=81b

9b² -58b +69=0

Compute discriminant D=58² -4*9*69=3364 -2484=880.

sqrt(880)=sqrt(16*55)=4√55≈29.66.

So, solutions:

b=(58 ±4√55)/18=(29 ±2√55)/9.

Take positive solution:

b=(29 +2√55)/9≈(29 +15.033)/9≈44.033/9≈4.893.

So, a=3, b≈4.893, then z=23/(3*4.893)=23/(14.679)≈1.564.

Compute x² + y² + z²=3² + (4.893)^2 + (1.564)^2≈9 +23.944 +2.447≈35.391.

Which is less than 41.0625.

So, this case gives a smaller sum.

Alternatively, try a=4.

Then, equation becomes:

4b +23(1/4 +1/b)=27.

Multiply by 4b:

16b² +23(4b + b)=108b.

Wait, wait, let me recompute.

Wait, equation is 4b +23(1/4 +1/b)=27.

Multiply both sides by 4b:

16b² +23*(b +4)=108b.

Simplify:

16b² +23b +92=108b.

Bring all terms to left:

16b² -85b +92=0.

Compute discriminant D=85² -4*16*92=7225 -5984=1241.

sqrt(1241)≈35.23.

Solutions:

b=(85 ±35.23)/32.

Positive solution: (85 +35.23)/32≈120.23/32≈3.757.

So, a=4, b≈3.757, then z=23/(4*3.757)=23/(15.028)≈1.531.

Compute x² + y² + z²≈16 +14.119 +2.345≈32.464.

Still less than 41.0625.

So, this suggests that even when a and b are not equal, the sum x² + y² + z² is less than when a=b=2 and z=5.75.

Another test: let me try a=2.5.

Then, equation:

2.5b +23(1/2.5 +1/b)=27.

Compute 1/2.5=0.4, so:

2.5b +23*(0.4 +1/b)=27.

Multiply by b:

2.5b² +23*(0.4b +1)=27b.

Expand:

2.5b² +9.2b +23=27b.

Bring all terms to left:

2.5b² -17.8b +23=0.

Multiply by 2 to eliminate decimals:

5b² -35.6b +46=0.

Discriminant D=35.6² -4*5*46≈1267.36 -920≈347.36.

sqrt(347.36)≈18.63.

Solutions:

b=(35.6 ±18.63)/10.

Take positive solution: (35.6 +18.63)/10≈54.23/10≈5.423.

So, a=2.5, b≈5.423, z=23/(2.5*5.423)=23/(13.5575)≈1.696.

Compute x² + y² + z²≈6.25 +29.41 +2.879≈38.539.

Still less than 41.0625.

So, in all the test cases I've tried where a≠b, the sum x² + y² + z² is less than when a=b=2. So, it seems that the maximum occurs when a=b=2, z=5.75.

Therefore, I can conclude that the maximum x² + y² + z² is 657/16, giving r²=657/64, so p=657, q=64, and p+q=721.


To solve the problem, we need to find the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. The value of \( r^2 \) can be expressed as \( \frac{p}{q} \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime positive integers. We then find \( p + q \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables and Constraints:**
   - Let the dimensions of the rectangular box be \( x, y, z \).
   - Surface area: \( 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 \) ⇒ \( xy + yz + zx = 27 \).
   - Volume: \( xyz = 23 \).

2. **Space Diagonal of the Box:**
   - The space diagonal \( d \) of the box is given by \( d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \).
   - The radius \( r \) of the smallest enclosing sphere is \( r = \frac{d}{2} \), so \( r^2 = \frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{4} \).

3. **Express \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) in Terms of Known Quantities:**
   - Using the identity \( (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx) \), we have:
     \[
     x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.
     \]

4. **Maximize \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \):**
   - To maximize \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \), we need to maximize \( (x + y + z)^2 \).
   - Assume two variables are equal, say \( x = y \). Then:
     - From the surface area constraint: \( x^2 + 2xz = 27 \).
     - From the volume constraint: \( x^2 z = 23 \) ⇒ \( z = \frac{23}{x^2} \).
     - Substituting \( z \) into the surface area equation:
       \[
       x^2 + \frac{46}{x} = 27.
       \]
     - Solving this cubic equation yields \( x = 2 \) (since \( x = -1 + 2\sqrt{6} \) leads to a smaller space diagonal).

5. **Calculate Dimensions and Space Diagonal:**
   - For \( x = y = 2 \), \( z = \frac{23}{2^2} = 5.75 \).
   - Compute \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 + 5.75^2 = 4 + 4 + 33.0625 = 41.0625 = \frac{657}{16} \).
   - The space diagonal \( d = \sqrt{\frac{657}{16}} = \sqrt{41.0625} \).

6. **Determine \( r^2 \):**
   - \( r^2 = \frac{d^2}{4} = \frac{\frac{657}{16}}{4} = \frac{657}{64} \).
   - Since 657 and 64 are coprime, \( p = 657 \) and \( q = 64 \).

7. **Final Result:**
   - \( p + q = 657 + 64 = 721 \).

### Answer:
\boxed{721}
