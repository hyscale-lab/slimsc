Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the product of two numbers, x and y, given some logarithmic equations. Both x and y are greater than 1, which is good to know because logarithms can get tricky otherwise. Let me write down the problem again to make sure I have it right.

The problem says:
There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that
log_x(y^x) = 10 and log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.
We need to find xy.

Hmm. So, two logarithmic equations, both equal to 10. Maybe I can translate these logarithmic equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle. I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, let's apply that.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.
Using the logarithm property, this means x^10 = y^x. So, equation one is x^10 = y^x.

Now the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.
Similarly, this translates to y^10 = x^{4y}. So, equation two is y^10 = x^{4y}.

So now I have two equations:
1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

I need to solve for x and y. Hmm, both equations involve exponents with x and y in both the base and the exponent, which might make it a bit complicated. Maybe I can take the logarithm of both sides again to linearize the exponents. Or perhaps find a way to express y in terms of x or vice versa.

Let me try taking natural logs of both equations to see if that helps.

Starting with equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

Taking ln of both sides: ln(x^10) = ln(y^x).

Using the power rule for logarithms: 10 ln x = x ln y.

Similarly, equation 2: y^10 = x^{4y}.

Taking ln: ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y}).

Again, power rule: 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

So now I have two new equations:

1. 10 ln x = x ln y. Let me call this equation A.
2. 10 ln y = 4y ln x. Let me call this equation B.

Hmm, now I have two equations with ln x and ln y. Maybe I can express ln y from equation A and substitute into equation B.

From equation A:
10 ln x = x ln y
So, ln y = (10 ln x) / x.

Now plug this into equation B:
10 ln y = 4y ln x
Substitute ln y:
10 * (10 ln x / x) = 4y ln x

Simplify left side: (100 ln x) / x = 4y ln x.

Wait, so I have (100 ln x)/x = 4y ln x.

Hmm, assuming ln x is not zero (which it isn't because x > 1, so ln x > 0), I can divide both sides by ln x.

So, 100 / x = 4y.

Simplify: 100 / x = 4y → Multiply both sides by x: 100 = 4y x → Divide both sides by 4: y x = 25.

Wait, so xy is 25? That's the product we're supposed to find. So, is that it? Did I just find that xy is 25?

But wait, let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in substituting or simplifying.

Let me go back through the steps.

From equation A: ln y = (10 ln x)/x.

Substitute into equation B: 10*(10 ln x/x) = 4y ln x.

So, 100 ln x /x = 4y ln x.

Divide both sides by ln x (since ln x ≠ 0): 100/x = 4y.

Then, 100 = 4xy → xy = 25.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the product xy is 25. So, maybe that's the answer.

But just to be thorough, perhaps I should check if there exist real numbers x and y greater than 1 that satisfy both original equations and give xy=25.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find x and y explicitly.

We know that xy =25, so y =25/x.

Let me substitute y =25/x into equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

So, x^10 = (25/x)^x.

Take natural log of both sides:

10 ln x = x ln(25/x)

Simplify the right side: ln(25/x) = ln25 - lnx.

So, 10 ln x = x (ln25 - ln x) = x ln25 - x lnx.

Bring all terms to one side: 10 ln x + x lnx - x ln25 =0.

Hmm, this is an equation in terms of x. Let me factor out ln x:

Wait, no, because the terms are 10 lnx, x lnx, and -x ln25. So, combining the lnx terms:

(10 + x) lnx - x ln25 =0.

So, (10 + x) lnx = x ln25.

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe we can write it as:

(10 + x)/x = ln25 / lnx.

But this seems complicated. Maybe instead, let's consider using substitution.

Let me define t = lnx. Then, since y=25/x, ln y = ln25 - lnx = ln25 - t.

From equation A: ln y = (10 t)/x. Wait, but x = e^t. So, equation A gives ln y = (10 t)/e^t.

But ln y is also ln25 - t. So,

ln25 - t = (10 t)/e^t.

So, ln25 - t = 10 t e^{-t}.

Hmm, that's a transcendental equation in t, which might not have a closed-form solution. Maybe I can solve it numerically, but since this is a problem that expects an integer answer, perhaps that's not necessary.

Wait, but earlier I found xy=25, so maybe that's the answer. Let me just verify with the equations.

Suppose xy=25, so y=25/x.

Then, from equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y}.

Substitute y=25/x:

(25/x)^10 = x^{4*(25/x)}.

Simplify left side: (25^10)/(x^10).

Right side: x^{100/x}.

So, (25^10)/(x^10) = x^{100/x}.

Let me take natural logs again:

10 ln25 -10 lnx = (100/x) lnx.

Bring all terms to one side:

10 ln25 -10 lnx - (100/x) lnx =0.

Factor out ln x:

10 ln25 - lnx [10 + 100/x ] =0.

But since xy=25, x=25/y. So, 100/x=4y. Wait, earlier we had that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express x in terms of y.

Wait, let me see if I can find the value of x.

If I take equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

And equation 2: y^10 = x^{4y}.

But since xy=25, we can substitute y=25/x into equation 2:

(25/x)^10 = x^{4*(25/x)}.

Which is the same as equation 2.

Alternatively, maybe I can express equation 1 as x^10 = y^x. Taking both sides to the power of 1/x: x^{10/x}=y.

So, y= x^{10/x}.

Similarly, equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y}.

Substitute y from above: (x^{10/x})^10 =x^{4y}.

Simplify left side: x^{100/x} =x^{4y}.

Since the bases are the same, exponents must be equal: 100/x =4y.

But since y=25/x, 100/x=4*(25/x)=100/x.

So, 100/x=100/x. Which is an identity. So, that doesn't give new information.

Hmm, so perhaps once we have xy=25, the equations are consistent, but we can't find exact values for x and y without more information. But the problem only asks for xy, which we found as 25. So maybe that's the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose I choose xy=25, so y=25/x. Let's see if there's a specific x and y that satisfy the original equations.

Suppose I assume x=y=5, since 5*5=25. Let's check.

First equation: log_5(5^5)=log_5(3125)=5. But wait, the first equation is supposed to equal 10, so that's not correct. So x and y can't both be 5.

Hmm, so maybe x and y are not both 5. Let me try to find specific x and y.

Wait, another approach: from equation 1 and equation 2, we can set up a system.

We have:

1. x^10 = y^x.

2. y^10 = x^{4y}.

From equation 1: y =x^{10/x}.

From equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y}.

Substituting y from equation 1 into equation 2:

(x^{10/x})^10 =x^{4y}.

Which simplifies to x^{100/x}=x^{4y}.

Therefore, 100/x =4y.

Which gives y=25/x, as before.

So, we have that xy=25.

So, for any x, y=25/x, but these x and y also need to satisfy equation 1: x^{10}=y^x.

So, equation 1 becomes x^{10} = (25/x)^x.

Which is x^{10} =25^x /x^x.

Multiply both sides by x^x: x^{10+x} =25^x.

Take natural logs: (10 +x) ln x =x ln25.

Which is the same equation as before.

Hmm, so I have (10 +x) ln x =x ln25.

I can rearrange this as:

(10 + x)/x = ln25 / ln x.

Which is (10/x +1) = ln25 / lnx.

Let me denote t = lnx. Then, ln25 = t * something.

Wait, let's see:

(10/x +1) = ln25 / t.

But x = e^t, so 10/x =10 e^{-t}.

So, equation becomes:

(10 e^{-t} +1) = ln25 / t.

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation. I don't think we can solve this algebraically. Maybe we can find a value of t that satisfies this.

Let me try t=2, which would mean x=e^2≈7.389.

Let me compute left side: 10 e^{-2} +1 ≈10*(0.1353)+1≈1.353 +1
