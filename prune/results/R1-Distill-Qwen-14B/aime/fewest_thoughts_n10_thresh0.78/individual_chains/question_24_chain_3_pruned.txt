Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, we have a list of positive integers with certain properties, and we need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Hmm, let me break down the given conditions.

First, the sum of all the items is 30. That's straightforward. Second, the unique mode is 9. Mode is the number that appears most frequently, so 9 must appear more times than any other number. And third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself. Interesting. So the median is a number not present in the list.

Let me think about what the median implies. The median is the middle number when the list is ordered. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But the problem says the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So if the list has an even number of elements, the median would be the average of the two middle numbers, which must be an integer not in the list. Alternatively, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, which is an integer not in the list. Wait, but the middle number in an odd-sized list is part of the list, right? So that can't be. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements, so that the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which isn't in the list.

So the list has an even number of elements, let's say 2k. Then the median is (a_k + a_{k+1}) / 2, which is an integer not present in the list. Also, all elements are positive integers.

Let me summarize the conditions again:

1. Sum of elements: 30.
2. Unique mode: 9.
3. Median: integer not in the list.

So, mode is 9, so 9 appears more frequently than any other number. So, let's think about the number of times 9 appears.

Let me assume the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. Let's denote the number of 9s as m. Since it's the unique mode, m must be greater than the count of any other number in the list.

Also, the sum is 3
