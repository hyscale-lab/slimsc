Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how long Aya's walk takes her when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk. She stops at a coffee shop afterward, and the time she spends there is t minutes. So, the total time she spends each morning is the time walking plus t minutes.

The problem gives me two scenarios:

1. When she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, her walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop.
2. When she increases her speed to s + 2 km/h, her walk takes 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including t minutes in the coffee shop.

I need to find the total time when her speed is s + 1/2 km/h.

Let me try to translate this into equations. Since time equals distance divided by speed, the walking time without the coffee stop would be distance divided by speed. But since the total time includes the coffee stop, I'll have to add t minutes to both scenarios.

But wait, the times given are in hours and minutes. Maybe I should convert everything into hours to keep the units consistent.

So, for the first scenario:
- Walking speed: s km/h
- Distance: 9 km
- Total time including coffee: 4 hours
- So, walking time = total time - t minutes. But t is in minutes, so I need to convert it to hours. Let me denote t in hours as t/60.

Therefore, walking time in the first scenario is (4 - t/60) hours.

But wait, the walking time is also equal to distance/speed, which is 9/s hours.

So, I can set up the equation:
9/s = 4 - t/60.

Similarly, for the second scenario:
- Walking speed: s + 2 km/h
- Total time including coffee: 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert 24 minutes to hours: 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So total time is 2.4 hours.
- So,
