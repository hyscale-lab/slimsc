Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit positive integer, N, such that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let's break this down. So N is a four-digit number, meaning it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the largest such N with the given property.

The property is that changing any one digit to 1 makes it divisible by 7. So, for each digit in N, if I replace it with 1, the number becomes a multiple of 7. Interesting.

So, let me denote N as a four-digit number: let's say N = a b c d, where a, b, c, d are its digits. So N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

Now, the condition is that changing any one digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So, let's consider each case:

1. Changing the thousands digit (a) to 1: Then the number becomes 1bcd. So, 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing the hundreds digit (b) to 1: The number becomes a1cd. So, 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing the tens digit (c) to 1: The number becomes ab1d. So, 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing the units digit (d) to 1: The number becomes abc1. So, 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these four modified numbers must be divisible by 7.

Wait, but N itself doesn't necessarily have to be divisible by 7, right? Only the numbers formed by changing one digit to 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, N could be anything, as long as those four conditions are satisfied.

Since we want the greatest four-digit number, we should start checking from 9999 downwards. But that's a bit time-consuming. Maybe we can find a smarter way.

Let me think about the possible remainders when these numbers are divided by 7. For each modified number, it's congruent to 0 mod 7.

So, for each case, let's write the congruence.

Let me denote N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

1. When a is changed to 1: The number is 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. So,

1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

But N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. So, 1000 + 100b + 10c + d = (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) - 1000(a - 1).

Wait, that might not be the easiest way.

Alternatively, since N is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, then the modified number is 1000 + 100b + 10c + d = N - 1000(a - 1).

So, N - 1000(a - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which implies N ≡ 1000(a - 1) mod 7.

Similarly, for the other cases.

Wait, maybe instead of dealing with N, I can think about the four modified numbers modulo 7.

But perhaps another approach is to realize that for each digit position, changing it to 1 gives a number divisible by 7.

So, for each digit, the difference between N and the modified number should be such that when we subtract the modified number from N, we get a number that is 0 mod 7.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the modified number is N with one digit changed to 1. So, the modified number is equal to N - (digit - 1) * place value.

For example, if we change the thousands digit a to 1, the modified number is N - (a - 1)*1000.

Similarly, changing the hundreds digit b to 1: modified number is N - (b - 1)*100.

Changing c: N - (c - 1)*10.

Changing d: N - (d - 1)*1.

Each of these modified numbers is divisible by 7, so:

N - (a - 1)*1000 ≡ 0 mod 7 --> N ≡ (a - 1)*1000 mod 7.

Similarly,

N ≡ (b - 1)*100 mod 7,

N ≡ (c - 1)*10 mod 7,

N ≡ (d - 1)*1 mod 7.

So, N must satisfy all four congruences:

1. N ≡ (a - 1)*1000 mod 7.

2. N ≡ (b - 1)*100 mod 7.

3. N ≡ (c - 1)*10 mod 7.

4. N ≡ (d - 1) mod 7.

Now, since all these are congruences mod 7, perhaps we can compute the coefficients modulo 7 first.

Let me compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7.

Compute:

1000 / 7: 7*142=994, so 1000-994=6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

100 / 7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2. So 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 ≡ 3 mod 7? Wait, 7*1=7, 10-7=3. Yes, 10 ≡3 mod7.

1 ≡1 mod7.

So,

1. N ≡ (a - 1)*6 mod7.

2. N ≡ (b - 1)*2 mod7.

3. N ≡ (c - 1)*3 mod7.

4. N ≡ (d - 1)*1 mod7.

So, N must satisfy all four congruences.

But N itself is equal to 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Let's compute N mod7.

Since N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

We can compute each term mod7:

1000a ≡6a mod7,

100b ≡2b mod7,

10c ≡3c mod7,

d ≡d mod7.

So, N ≡6a + 2b + 3c +d mod7.

So, from the above, N ≡6a + 2b + 3c +d mod7.

But from the four congruences, we have:

1. N ≡6(a - 1) mod7.

2. N ≡2(b - 1) mod7.

3. N ≡3(c - 1) mod7.

4. N ≡1(d - 1) mod7.

So, let's write each of these:

1. N ≡6(a - 1) mod7.

2. N ≡2(b - 1) mod7.

3. N ≡3(c - 1) mod7.

4. N ≡ (d - 1) mod7.

But N ≡6a + 2b + 3c + d mod7.

So, perhaps we can set up equations.

From condition 1:

6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡6(a -1) mod7.

Simplify:

Left side:6a + 2b + 3c + d.

Right side:6a -6.

Subtract right side from left: [6a + 2b + 3c + d] - [6a -6] = 2b + 3c + d +6 ≡0 mod7.

So, 2b + 3c + d +6 ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, from condition 2:

6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡2(b -1) mod7.

Left side:6a + 2b + 3c + d.

Right side:2b -2.

Subtracting, [6a +2b +3c +d] - [2b -2] =6a +3c + d +2 ≡0 mod7.

So, 6a +3c + d +2 ≡0 mod7.

From condition3:

6a +2b +3c +d ≡3(c -1) mod7.

Left side:6a +2b +3c +d.

Right side:3c -3.

Subtracting, [6a +2b +3c +d] - [3c -3] =6a +2b +d +3 ≡0 mod7.

So, 6a +2b +d +3 ≡0 mod7.

From condition4:

6a +2b +3c +d ≡(d -1) mod7.

Left side:6a +2b +3c +d.

Right side:d -1.

Subtracting, [6a +2b +3c +d] - [d -1] =6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, 6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, now, we have four equations:

1. 2b + 3c + d ≡1 mod7. (Because 2b +3c +d +6 ≡0 → 2b+3c+d ≡1).

Wait, 2b + 3c + d +6 ≡0 mod7 → 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7 because 6 ≡ -1 mod7, so -6 ≡1 mod7.

Wait, no, 6 ≡6 mod7, so 2b +3c +d +6 ≡0 → 2b +3c +d ≡-6 mod7 → which is 1 mod7.

Yes, because -6 is equivalent to 1 modulo7.

So, equation1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

Equation2:6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7. (Because 6a +3c +d +2 ≡0 → 6a +3c +d ≡-2 mod7, which is 5 mod7).

Equation3:6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7. (Because 6a +2b +d +3 ≡0 → 6a +2b +d ≡-3 mod7 →4 mod7).

Equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7. (Because 6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 → 6a +2b +3c ≡-1 mod7 →6 mod7).

So, now, four equations:

1. 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

2.6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

3.6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

4.6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

Hmm, now, perhaps we can solve these equations step by step.

Let me note that these are four congruences mod7. Let me try to express variables in terms of others.

From equation3: 6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

We can write d ≡4 -6a -2b mod7.

Similarly, from equation2:6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

Substitute d from equation3: 6a +3c + (4 -6a -2b) ≡5 mod7.

Simplify: (6a -6a) +3c -2b +4 ≡5 →3c -2b +4 ≡5 →3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

So, equation2a:3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

From equation1:2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

Again, substitute d from equation3: 2b +3c + (4 -6a -2b) ≡1 mod7.

Simplify:2b -2b +3c +4 -6a ≡1 →3c -6a +4 ≡1 →3c -6a ≡-3 mod7 →3c -6a ≡4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime, so division is allowed):

c - 2a ≡ (4)/3 mod7.

But 3 inverse mod7 is 5 because 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So, multiply both sides by5:

( c -2a ) *5 ≡4*5 →5c -10a ≡20 mod7.

But 5c -10a ≡5c -3a (since 10≡3 mod7).

And 20 mod7 is 6, since 7*2=14, 20-14=6.

So, 5c -3a ≡6 mod7.

Hmm, but perhaps another approach: from equation1a, 3c -6a ≡4 mod7.

That is, 3(c -2a) ≡4 mod7 → c -2a ≡ (4 * 3^{-1}) mod7.

Since 3^{-1} is 5, as before, 4*5=20≡6 mod7.

So, c -2a ≡6 mod7.

So, c ≡2a +6 mod7.

So, equation1b: c ≡2a +6 mod7.

Now, let's look at equation2a:3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

We can substitute c from equation1b into equation2a.

So, 3*(2a +6) -2b ≡1 mod7.

Compute:6a +18 -2b ≡1 mod7.

Simplify:

6a -2b +18 ≡1 mod7.

18 mod7 is 4, because 7*2=14, 18-14=4.

So, 6a -2b +4 ≡1 mod7 →6a -2b ≡-3 mod7 →6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

So, equation2b:6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

From equation3:6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

We can also write equation2b as 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Let me add equation2b and equation3.

Equation3:6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

Equation2b:6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Adding:

(6a +2b +d) + (6a -2b) ≡4 +4 mod7.

So, 12a +d ≡8 mod7.

12 mod7 is 5, and 8 mod7 is 1.

So, 5a + d ≡1 mod7.

So, equation5:5a +d ≡1 mod7.

Also, from equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

We can substitute c from equation1b: c=2a +6 mod7.

So, 6a +2b +3*(2a +6) ≡6 mod7.

Compute:6a +2b +6a +18 ≡6 mod7.

Simplify:

12a +2b +18 ≡6 mod7.

12 mod7 is 5, 18 mod7 is4.

So, 5a +2b +4 ≡6 mod7 →5a +2b ≡2 mod7.

So, equation4a:5a +2b ≡2 mod7.

Now, from equation2b:6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Let me write this as: 6a -2b ≡4.

And equation4a:5a +2b ≡2.

If I add these two equations:

(6a -2b) + (5a +2b) ≡4 +2 mod7.

So, 11a ≡6 mod7.

11 mod7 is4, so:

4a ≡6 mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of4 mod7. 4*2=8≡1 mod7, so inverse is2.

So, a ≡6*2 =12≡5 mod7.

So, a ≡5 mod7.

Since a is a digit (thousands place), a can be 5 or 12, but as a digit, it's from1 to9. So, a=5 or a=12? Wait, a is a single digit, so a=5 or a=5+7=12, but 12 is not a digit. So, a=5.

So, a=5.

Now, a=5. Let's find other variables.

From equation1b: c=2a +6 mod7.

a=5, so 2*5=10≡3 mod7. So, c=3 +6=9 mod7.

Wait, 3 +6=9≡2 mod7.

Wait, no, 2a +6 is 10 +6=16≡2 mod7.

So, c≡2 mod7. So, c can be 2 or 9, because c is a digit (0-9). So, c=2 or9.

But we're looking for the greatest four-digit number, so likely c=9.

Wait, let's proceed step by step.

From equation2b:6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

a=5, so 6*5=30≡2 mod7. So,

2 -2b ≡4 mod7 → -2b ≡2 mod7 → 2b≡-2≡5 mod7.

So, 2b≡5 mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of2 mod7, which is4 because 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So, b≡5*4=20≡6 mod7.

So, b=6 or 6+7=13. But b is a digit, so b=6.

So, b=6.

From equation3:6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

a=5, b=6.

6*5=30≡2 mod7, 2*6=12≡5 mod7.

So, 2 +5 +d ≡4 mod7 →7 +d ≡4 mod7.

7≡0, so d≡4 mod7.

So, d=4 or 11, but d is a digit, so d=4.

Now, c can be 2 or9, but we thought earlier c=2 or9. Let's see.

From equation1b: c ≡2 mod7. So, c=2 or9.

But which one? Let's see.

We need to determine c. Let's see if both are possible.

We have a=5, b=6, d=4.

So, N is 5 6 c 4.

We need to check whether both c=2 and c=9 satisfy the original conditions.

But wait, we might have more constraints.

From equation4a:5a +2b ≡2 mod7.

a=5, b=6.

5*5=25≡4 mod7, 2*6=12≡5 mod7.

4 +5=9≡2 mod7. So, 9≡2 mod7 → 2≡2. So, okay.

So, the equations are satisfied.

Now, let's see for c, we have c=2 or9.

But do both satisfy equation1?

Equation1:2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

b=6, d=4.

2*6=12≡5 mod7, d=4.

So, 5 +3c +4 ≡1 mod7 →3c +9≡1 mod7.

But 9 mod7 is2, so 3c +2 ≡1 →3c≡-1≡6 mod7.

So, 3c≡6 mod7 →c≡2 mod7.

So, c=2 or9.

So, both possibilities are allowed.

So, c can be2 or9.

But we need the greatest four-digit number. So, between 5694 and 5624, 5694 is larger.

So, let's check if c=9 is possible.

Wait, but c=9 would make N=5694.

But let's check if all four modified numbers are divisible by7.

Wait, perhaps it's better to check if c=9 works.

Wait, let's check each condition.

N=5694.

Check changing each digit to1:

1. Change thousands digit to1: 1694.

Check if 1694 is divisible by7.

1694 ÷7: 7*242=1694? 7*240=1680, 7*242=1694. Yes, correct.

2. Change hundreds digit to1: 5194.

Check 5194 ÷7: 7*742=5194? 7*700=4900, 7*42=294. 4900+294=5194. Yes.

3. Change tens digit to1: 5614.

5614 ÷7: 7*802=5614? 7*800=5600, 7*2=14. 5600+14=5614. Yes.

4. Change units digit to1: 5691.

5691 ÷7: 7*813=5691? 7*800=5600, 7*13=91. 5600+91=5691. Yes.

So, all four modified numbers are divisible by7. So, N=5694 is a valid number.

But wait, is there a larger number than 5694 with this property?

Because 5694 is the first candidate, but we might have a larger N.

Wait, what's the maximum four-digit number? 9999.

But we might have another number higher than 5694 that satisfies the condition.

So, perhaps N=5694 is not the maximum.

Wait, but wait, a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 gives 5694.

Is there a way to have a higher number? For example, a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is 5694.

But if c=9 is the maximum, perhaps we can have a higher digit in some other place.

Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, a=5, b=6, c=2 or9, d=4.

So, the maximum N is 5694.

But maybe I made a mistake in assuming a=5. Because a is determined mod7, but a is a digit from1-9.

Wait, a≡5 mod7. So, possible a=5 or 12, but 12 is invalid. So, a=5.

So, a must be5.

So, that's fixed.

So, with a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4, N=5694.

Wait, but let's check if N=5694 is the maximum.

Is there a higher number with a=5, but higher digits in b, c, or d?

Wait, if a=5, the maximum possible four-digit number is 5999.

But let's see if 5999 satisfies the condition.

But probably not, because when we change digits to1, it might not be divisible by7.

But perhaps it's better to see if N=5694 is indeed the maximum.

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe a higher N exists.

Wait, let's think about the equations.

We found a=5, b=6, c=2 or9, d=4.

So, the maximum c is9, so N=5694.

But wait, perhaps if c=9, and d=4, is that the maximum?

Alternatively, if we can have a=5, b=6, c=9, d= higher than4, but d must ≡4 mod7.

So, d can be4 or11. But 11 is invalid as a digit, so d=4.

So, d=4 is fixed.

So, N=5694.

But let me check if there's a higher N with a=5, but higher b, c, d.

Wait, for example, a=5, b=7, c= something, d= something.

But according to our equations, b must be6 mod7.

Because b=6 mod7, since b=6 or13, but b=6 is the only valid digit.

So, b must be6.

So, b=6 is fixed.

So, a=5, b=6, c=2 or9, d=4.

So, the maximum N is 5694.

Wait, but let me check if N=5694 is the maximum.

Wait, let me see if I can have a higher N with a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4.

Yes, that's the maximum.

But wait, let me check for a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4.

Is there any way to have a higher N?

Wait, perhaps with a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the highest.

But let me think again.

Wait, perhaps if a=5, but b=6, c=9, d=4, but is this the maximum possible?

Alternatively, if a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the maximum, then N=5694.

But perhaps I can have a higher N with a=5, but b=6, c=9, d=4.

Wait, but maybe a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the highest possible.

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the equations gave me a=5, b=6, c=2 or9, d=4.

So, c can be2 or9.

So, the maximum N is 5694.

But let me check if a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the maximum.

Wait, but what about if I change a=5, but have a higher b?

No, because b is fixed at6 mod7, and b=6 is the maximum digit with b=6.

So, no, I can't have a higher b.

Similarly, c=9 is the highest possible for c given c=2 or9.

So, N=5694 is the maximum.

But wait, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps if I can have a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4, which is 5694.

But what if I have a=5, b=6, c=9, d=11? No, d can't be11.

So, d=4 is fixed.

So, N=5694.

But wait, let me check if N=5694 is the maximum, or if perhaps a higher N exists.

Wait, perhaps if a=5, but with higher digits in b, c, d.

But according to our equations, b must be6, c=2 or9, d=4.

So, the maximum N is 5694.

But let me check another possibility.

Wait, perhaps a=5, but b=6, c=9, d=4 is the maximum.

But I can check if a=5, but b=6, c=9, d=4, and see if any higher N exists.

Alternatively, perhaps a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the maximum.

But let me think if a can be higher.

Wait, a=5 is fixed because a≡5 mod7, and a is a digit, so a=5 is the only possibility.

So, a=5 is fixed.

So, N=5694 is the maximum.

Wait, but let me check if N=5694 is indeed the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the equations.

Wait, let me re-examine the equations.

From equation1b: c ≡2a +6 mod7.

With a=5, 2a=10≡3 mod7. So, c≡3+6=9≡2 mod7.

Wait, 9 mod7 is2. So, c can be2 or9.

So, correct.

From equation2b:6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

With a=5, 6a=30≡2 mod7.

So, 2 -2b ≡4 mod7 → -2b ≡2 →2b≡-2≡5 mod7.

So, 2b≡5 →b≡(5*4)=20≡6 mod7.

So, b=6.

So, correct.

From equation3:6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

6*5=30≡2, 2*6=12≡5. So, 2+5 +d ≡4 →7 +d≡4 →d≡-3≡4 mod7.

So, d=4.

So, yes, correct.

So, N=5694 is the maximum.

But wait, let me check if N=5694 is the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps a higher N exists.

Wait, perhaps if c=9, but d=11? No, d must be4.

So, N=5694 is the maximum.

But wait, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I can have a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4, which is5694.

But what if I have a=5, b=6, c=9, d=11? No, invalid.

So, N=5694 is the maximum.

But let me check if N=5694 is indeed the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps I can have a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4, which is5694.

But wait, let me check if a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is indeed the maximum, or if a=5, b=6, c=2, d=4 is lower.

Yes, 5624 is lower than5694.

So, N=5694 is the maximum.

But wait, let me check another thing.

What if a=5, but b=6, c=9, d=4 is indeed the maximum.

So, N=5694.

But let me check if N=5694 is the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that a=5.

Wait, a≡5 mod7, so a=5,12,... but a is a digit, so a=5.

So, correct.

So, N=5694.

But let me check if N=5694 is the maximum.

Wait, but perhaps I can have a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4, which is5694.

So, I think N=5694 is the maximum.

So, now, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by1000.

So, N=5694.

5694 ÷1000=5 with remainder 694.

So, Q=5, R=694.

Thus, Q + R=5 +694=699.

Wait, but let me compute 5 +694=699.

So, the answer is699.

But wait, let me make sure that N=5694 is correct.

Wait, when I change each digit to1:

1. 1694: 1694 ÷7=242, correct.

2. 5194: 5194 ÷7=742, correct.

3. 5614: 5614 ÷7=802, correct.

4. 5691: 5691 ÷7=813, correct.

So, all four modified numbers are divisible by7.

Thus, N=5694 is indeed correct.

So, Q=5, R=694, so Q + R=699.


To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Let \( N = \overline{abcd} \), where \( a, b, c, d \) are its digits.

### Key Steps:

1. **Conditions on Digits**:
   - Changing any digit to 1 must yield a number divisible by 7.
   - This leads to four congruences for \( N \) modulo 7, based on each digit being changed to 1.

2. **Modulo 7 Analysis**:
   - Compute the place values modulo 7: \( 1000 \equiv 6 \), \( 100 \equiv 2 \), \( 10 \equiv 3 \), and \( 1 \equiv 1 \).
   - Set up congruences for \( N \) based on changing each digit to 1.

3. **Solving the System**:
   - Derive equations for \( N \) modulo 7 and solve for each digit \( a, b, c, d \).
   - Find that \( a = 5 \), \( b = 6 \), \( c = 9 \), and \( d = 4 \).

4. **Verification**:
   - Confirm that \( N = 5694 \) satisfies all conditions by checking divisibility when each digit is changed to 1.

5. **Compute \( Q + R \)**:
   - Divide \( N = 5694 \) by 1000 to get \( Q = 5 \) (quotient) and \( R = 694 \) (remainder).
   - Sum \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{699}
