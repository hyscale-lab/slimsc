Okay, so I have this problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to understand what it means. 

From the problem statement: A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are satisfied. First, when n is expressed in base b, it must have exactly two digits. Second, the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. 

They gave an example: 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. 

So, I need to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. 

Hmm, okay. So, let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, let's understand what a two-digit number in base b looks like. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form a* b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a cannot be zero, and the digits a and c must satisfy 0 ≤ a, c < b. 

So, the number n can be written as n = a*b + c, where a is from 1 to b-1, and c is from 0 to b-1. 

The second condition is that the sum of the digits, a + c, equals the square root of n. So, mathematically, that's:

a + c = sqrt(n)

But n is equal to a*b + c, so substituting that in, we get:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c

Let me rearrange terms to bring everything to one side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe factor or find a way to express this equation in terms of a and c. Let's see.

Let me group terms:

a^2 + (2c - b)*a + (c^2 - c) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a, where the coefficients depend on c and b. 

So, if I treat this as a quadratic in a, for each c, we can solve for a:

a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0

The quadratic equation is of the form Aa^2 + Ba + C = 0, where:
A = 1,
B = (2c - b),
C = (c^2 - c)

So, the discriminant D of this quadratic equation is:

D = B^2 - 4AC = (2c - b)^2 - 4*(1)*(c^2 - c)

Let me compute that:

(2c - b)^2 = 4c^2 -4b c + b^2

4AC = 4*(c^2 - c) = 4c^2 -4c

So,

D = (4c^2 -4b c + b^2) - (4c^2 -4c)
= 4c^2 -4b c + b^2 -4c^2 +4c
= (-4b c +4c) + b^2
= 4c(1 - b) + b^2

Wait, let me compute that again:

4c^2 -4b c + b^2 -4c^2 +4c

So, 4c^2 -4c^2 cancels out.

Then, we have (-4b c +4c) + b^2.

Factor out 4c(-b +1) + b^2.

So, D = 4c(1 - b) + b^2.

Hmm, for a to be an integer, the discriminant D must be a perfect square because a must be an integer. So, D must be non-negative and a perfect square.

So, D = (2c - b)^2 -4(c^2 - c) = 4c(1 - b) + b^2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me double-check.

Compute D again:

D = (2c - b)^2 - 4*(c^2 - c)

Expand (2c - b)^2: 4c² -4b c + b².

Then subtract 4(c² -c): 4c² -4b c + b² -4c² +4c.

Yes, so 4c² -4c² is zero. Then, -4b c +4c, which is 4c(1 - b). Then, plus b².

So, D = 4c(1 - b) + b².

Hmm, that seems correct. So, D must be a perfect square.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this. Let me think.

We have n = a*b + c, and a + c = sqrt(n), so:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Let me denote s = a + c. Then, s = sqrt(n) => n = s².

So, n = a*b + c = s².

But s = a + c, so substituting:

a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

So, same as before. Let me rearrange:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Expanding:

a² + 2ac + c² = a b + c.

Bring all terms to the left:

a² + 2ac + c² - a b - c = 0.

Which is what I had earlier. So, perhaps another approach is to express b in terms of a and c.

From the equation:

a² + 2ac + c² - a b - c = 0

Rearranged:

a b = a² + 2ac + c² - c

So,

b = (a² + 2ac + c² - c)/a

Simplify numerator:

a² + 2ac + c² - c = a² + 2ac + c² - c

= (a² + 2ac + c²) - c

= (a + c)^2 - c

So,

b = [(a + c)^2 - c ] / a

Since b must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, this expression must result in an integer. So, for given a and c, [(a + c)^2 - c] must be divisible by a.

So, [(a + c)^2 - c] mod a must be zero.

Let me denote s = a + c. Then, [(s)^2 - c] must be divisible by a.

But since s = a + c, c = s - a.

So, substituting:

(s)^2 - (s - a) = s² - s + a

So, [(s)^2 - c] = s² - s + a.

Thus, [(s)^2 - c]/a = (s² - s + a)/a.

This simplifies to (s² - s)/a + 1.

So, (s² - s)/a must be an integer since the entire expression must be integer. Therefore, (s² - s) must be divisible by a.

So, a divides (s² - s). Since s = a + c, and a is a digit in base b, a is between 1 and b-1.

Hmm, perhaps this approach is a bit tangled. Maybe it's better to fix s and explore possible a and c.

Wait, another thought: since a and c are digits in base
