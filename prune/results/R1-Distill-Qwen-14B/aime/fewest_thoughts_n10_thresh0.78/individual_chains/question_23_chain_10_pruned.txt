Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but wait, no, I think they are. Wait, I'm confusing with a kite. Let me think. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Yes, that's right because all sides are equal, so the diagonals must be perpendicular to maintain symmetry.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense because hyperbolas are symmetric about their centers. So, points A, B, C, D must be arranged such that the diagonals cross at (0,0). Also, since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, so the distances between consecutive points should be the same.

Now, the hyperbola equation is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, this is a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis with length 2a, where a² = 20, so a = 2√5. The conjugate axis length is 2b, where b² = 24, so b = 2√6. The asymptotes are y = ±(b/a)x = ±(√(24/20))x = ±(√(6/5))x.

Since the rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, the diagonals are essentially the lines connecting opposite vertices. So, if I denote one diagonal as AC, the other as BD, then A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, B and D are endpoints of the other.

Because the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the midpoint for both diagonals, points A and C are symmetric with respect to the origin, and similarly, B and D are symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D must be (-p, -q).

So, points A, B, C, D are (x, y), (p, q), (-x, -y), (-p, -q).

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, which equals the distance from C to D, which equals the distance from D to A.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the properties of the rhombus in terms of vectors or coordinates. Let me think.

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the dot product of vectors AC and BD should be zero. Wait, AC is the vector from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y), and BD is the vector from B to D, which is (-2p, -2q). But wait, actually, the diagonals are AC and BD, so the vectors representing the diagonals are AC = C - A = (-2x, -2y) and BD = D - B = (-2p, -2q). But for them to be perpendicular, their dot product should be zero.

So, AC · BD = 0.

So, (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0.

Which simplifies to 4xp + 4yq = 0.

Divide both sides by 4: xp + yq = 0.

So that's one condition.

Another condition is that all sides are equal. Let's compute the distance between A and B, which should equal the distance between B and C, and so on.

Distance AB squared is (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2.

Distance BC squared is (-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2.

Since AB = BC, their squares should be equal.

So, (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2.

Expanding both sides:

Left side: (p^2 - 2px + x²) + (q² - 2qy + y²) = p² + x² - 2px + q² + y² - 2qy.

Right side: (x² + 2px + p²) + (y² + 2qy + q²) = x² + p² + y² + q² + 2px + 2qy.

Set left equal to right:

p² + x² - 2px + q² + y² - 2qy = x² + p² + y² + q² + 2px + 2qy.

Simplify:

-2px -2qy = 2px + 2qy.

Bring all terms to one side:

-2px -2qy -2px -2qy = 0.

Combine like terms:

-4px -4qy = 0.

Divide both sides by -4: px + qy = 0.

Wait, but earlier we had xp + yq = 0 from the diagonals being perpendicular. So, both conditions give px + qy = 0, which is consistent.

So, that's one equation.

Now, let's think about the other distances. For example, AB should equal AD.

Wait, no, in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so AB = BC = CD = DA. So, maybe I should compute another pair.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the vectors. Let me think.

Since ABCD is a rhombus, the vectors AB and AD should have the same magnitude.

Vector AB is (p - x, q - y).

Vector AD is (-p - x, -q - y).

So, the squared magnitude of AB is (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2.

The squared magnitude of AD is (-p - x)^2 + (-q - y)^2.

Set them equal:

(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (-p - x)^2 + (-q - y)^2.

Wait, this is the same as before, so maybe this doesn't give a new condition.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that in a rhombus
