Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle lies either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. I remember that a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles are equal too.

First, I think I need to visualize the dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon, so it's quite complex. Since it's regular, all the vertices are equally spaced around a circle. That might help in figuring out the diagonals and sides.

I remember that in regular polygons, the sides can be considered as chords of the circumscribed circle. The length of a side depends on the number of sides it skips. For example, in a dodecagon, a side is a chord that connects two adjacent vertices, a diagonal that skips one vertex is the next possible chord, and so on, up to skipping five vertices, since beyond that, the diagonals start repeating in the opposite direction.

Wait, right. In a regular n-gon, each vertex connects to n-3 other vertices via diagonals (excluding itself and its two adjacent vertices). So, for a dodecagon, each vertex connects to 9 others via diagonals of varying lengths.

But how does this help with the rectangle? Well, a rectangle requires four points such that the opposite sides are equal and parallel, and the angles are 90 degrees. In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can form such rectangles if the points are chosen appropriately.

I think the key here is to identify pairs of parallel sides or diagonals that can form the opposite sides of a rectangle. So, maybe I need to find all possible pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) and then see how they can intersect to form rectangles.

Wait, but in a regular polygon with an even number of sides, like a dodecagon, there are multiple sets of parallel sides. For a regular dodecagon, each side has several sides parallel to it, spaced evenly around the polygon.

Let me think about the structure. A regular dodecagon can be inscribed in a circle, so all vertices lie on the circumference. Any side or diagonal can be represented as a chord of this circle. The length of the chord depends on the central angle it subtends.

The central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/12 = 30 degrees. So, the sides correspond to chords subtending 30 degrees, and diagonals correspond to chords that skip one, two, three, etc., vertices, which would correspond to 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, etc., degrees.

Wait, but beyond 180 degrees, the chords start repeating because a chord subtending theta degrees is the same as one subtending (360 - theta) degrees. So, for a dodecagon, the distinct central
