Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis in its plane. The circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of this circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So, the torus has two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis (so R = 6), and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle (r = 3). 

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The problem says when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's touching the sphere from the inside along a circular path. Similarly, when outside, it's touching along another circular path. I need to figure out the radii of these two circles.

Let me think about the geometry here. For the internal tangent case: the torus is inside the sphere, so the sphere's center is at some point, and the torus is centered at the same point as the sphere? Or maybe not? Wait, no, because when a torus is tangent to a sphere, the centers might not coincide. Wait, but in this case, since the torus is resting on the inside, perhaps the center of the generating circle of the torus is offset from the sphere's center?

Wait, actually, the torus is a surface of revolution. So, perhaps when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center is at the center of the torus's generating circle. Let me try to sketch this.

For the internal tangent case: The sphere of radius 11 has the torus inside it, and they're tangent along a circle. Similarly, for external tangent, the torus is outside the sphere, but they touch along a circle.

Wait, no. Wait, the sphere has radius 11, and when the torus rests on the inside, it's inside the sphere and tangent along a circle. When it rests on the outside, it's outside the sphere, but tangent along another circle.

Let me think about the internal tangent first. The torus is inside the sphere, so the sphere's surface is outside the torus. The point of tangency is a circle where both surfaces meet. So, the sphere's center is somewhere, and the torus is perhaps shifted relative to it.

Wait, maybe it's better to model the torus as a surface with its own center. The torus can be considered as having a major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3. So, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is R = 6, and the radius of the generating circle is 3.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is 11. The closest point on the torus to the sphere's center would be at a distance of R - r = 6 - 3 = 3 from the center of the generating circle. But the sphere's radius is 11, so the torus must fit inside the sphere, so the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's generating circle's center would be 11 - 3 = 8? Hmm, maybe.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. If the torus is inside the sphere and tangent along a circle,
