Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

First, the problem is about a lottery where Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. We need to find the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, it's a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), right? In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize means she has all four numbers correct, which automatically means she has at least two correct, so A is a subset of B. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, the probability we're looking for is P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute two probabilities: P(A), the probability that all four numbers match, and P(B), the probability that at least two numbers match.

Let me structure this:

1. Calculate the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10. That will be the denominator for all probabilities since each outcome is equally likely.

Total ways = C(10, 4), where C(n, k) is the combination formula, n choose k.

C(10, 4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So, total possible outcomes are 210.

2. Compute P(A): Probability that all four numbers match. That's only one possible combination, which is the exact set Jen picked. So, number of favorable outcomes is 1.

Therefore, P(A) = 1 / 210.

3. Compute P(B): Probability that at least two numbers match. So, this is the probability that in the randomly chosen 4 numbers, at least two are among the four that Jen picked.

Alternatively, it's easier to compute the probability of the complementary event (i.e., having fewer than two matches) and subtract that from 1.

So, P(B) = 1 - P(0 matches) - P(1 match).

So, let's compute P(0 matches): the number of ways to choose 4 numbers none of which are in Jen's set. Since Jen has 4 numbers, the remaining numbers are 10 - 4 = 6. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from these 6 is C(6,4).

C(6,4) = 15.

So, P(0 matches) = 15 / 210.

Similarly, compute P(1 match): the number of ways to choose exactly 1 number from Jen's 4 and the remaining 3 from the other 6.

So, the number of ways is C(4,1) * C(6,3).

C(4,1) = 4, C(6,3) = 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80.

Therefore, P(1 match) = 80 / 210.

Therefore, P(B) = 1 - (15 + 80) / 210 = 1 - 95 / 210.

Wait, 15 + 80 is 95, so 95 / 210 is the probability of 0 or 1 match. So, P(B) = (210 - 95) / 210 = 115 / 210.

Wait, let me double-check that:

Wait, number of favorable outcomes for at least two matches is total ways minus 0 matches minus 1 matches. So, that's 210 - 15 - 80 = 115.

So, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Simplify that: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42.

Wait, so P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, hold on, let me verify the calculations again.

C(6,4) is 15, correct.

C(4,1)*C(6,3)= 4*20=80, correct.

So, 15 + 80 = 95, so 210 - 95=115, yes. So P(B) is 115/210=23/42.

So, P(A) is 1/210, as before.

Therefore, the conditional probability P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B) = (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = (1/5) * (1/23) = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems small, but let me see.

Wait, 42/210 is 1/5, so 1/210 divided by 23/42 is (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1)/ (5*23) = 1/115.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the probability is 1/115. Therefore, m=1, n=115. Are they coprime? Yes, because 1 and any number are coprime.

So, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I compute P(B) correctly?

Alternative approach: Maybe compute P(B) directly instead of using the complement.

P(B) is the probability of having exactly 2, 3, or 4 matches.

So, number of favorable outcomes for exactly k matches is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k), for k = 2,3,4.

Let me compute each:

For k=2:

C(4,2) * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

k=3:

C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24.

k=4:

C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1.

Adding these together: 90 +24 +1=115.

So, yes, that's 115, so P(B)=115/210=23/42.

So, that matches.

Therefore, the conditional probability is (1/210)/(115/210)=1/115.

So, m=1, n=115, so m + n=116.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the problem statement.

Wait, Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, in that case, B is the event that the number of matches is 2,3, or 4. So, P(B) is 115/210. That seems correct.

Yes, so I think the answer is 1/115, so m + n is 116.

Wait, before I finalize, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.

Calculations:

Total ways: C(10,4)=210. Correct.

P(A)=1/210. Correct.

P(B)=1 - [C(6,4) + C(4,1)*C(6,3)] / C(10,4) = 1 - [15 + 80]/210 = 115/210. Correct.

Thus, conditional probability = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Yes, all steps are correct.

Therefore, the answer is 1/115, so m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.


The problem involves calculating the conditional probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize in a lottery. 

1. **Total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10**:  
   \[
   \binom{10}{4} = 210
   \]

2. **Probability of winning the grand prize (all four numbers match)**:  
   There is only 1 favorable outcome, so:  
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{1}{210}
   \]

3. **Probability of winning a prize (at least two numbers match)**:  
   Calculate the complementary probability (0 or 1 match) and subtract from 1.  
   - **0 matches**: Choose 4 numbers from the remaining 6:  
     \[
     \binom{6}{4} = 15
     \]
   - **1 match**: Choose 1 from Jen's 4 and 3 from the remaining 6:  
     \[
     \binom{4}{1} \times \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80
     \]
   - Total for 0 or 1 match:  
     \[
     15 + 80 = 95
     \]
   - Therefore, the probability of at least two matches:  
     \[
     P(B) = 1 - \frac{95}{210} = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42}
     \]

4. **Conditional probability of winning the grand prize given winning a prize**:  
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{115}
   \]

The fraction \(\frac{1}{115}\) simplifies to \(m = 1\) and \(n = 115\). Thus, \(m + n = 1 + 115 = 116\).

\[
\boxed{116}
\]
