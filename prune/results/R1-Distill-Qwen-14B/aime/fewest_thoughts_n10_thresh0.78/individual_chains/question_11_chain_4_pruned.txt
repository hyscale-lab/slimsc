Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that \( z \) is a complex number with magnitude 4. So, \( z \) can be written in the form \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). Alternatively, I could express \( z \) as \( a + bi \) with \( a^2 + b^2 = 16 \), but maybe using polar form will make things easier because dealing with exponents and reciprocals might be simpler that way.

Let me rewrite the expression with \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). Then, \( 1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). So the expression becomes:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]

Simplify the constants:

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4 = 300 + 468i \).

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4} = 24 + 36i \).

So now the expression is:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Hmm, okay. Now, I can express each term using Euler's formula: \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

Let me compute each part. Let me denote the first term as \( A e^{i\theta} \) where \( A = 300 + 468i \), and the second term as \( B e^{-i\theta} \) where \( B = 24 + 36i \).

Expanding the first term:

\( A e^{i\theta} = (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
= \( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2 \sin\theta \)
Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this becomes:
= \( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)
Grouping real and imaginary parts:
Real part: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)
Imaginary part: \( (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i \)

Similarly, expanding the second term:

\( B e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)
= \( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2 \sin\theta \)
Again, \( i^2 = -1 \), so:
= \( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)
Grouping real and imaginary parts:
Real part: \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)
Imaginary part: \( (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)i \)

Now, adding the two expanded terms together:

Total real part: \( [300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta] + [24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta] \)
= \( (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta \)
= \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

Total imaginary part: \( [300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta]i + [-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta]i \)
= \( (300\sin\theta -24\sin\theta) + (468\cos\theta +36\cos\theta) \)i
= \( 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta \)i

So the entire expression is:

\( [324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta] + [276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta]i \)

But we're interested in the real part of this expression. So:

Real part = \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

Our goal is to find the maximum value of this real part as \( \theta \) varies. So, I need to maximize the expression \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

I remember that expressions of the form \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) can be rewritten as \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \) where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( \phi \) is some phase shift. Alternatively, you can think of it as \( R\sin(\theta + \phi) \) depending on the sign. But regardless, the maximum value is \( R \).

Wait, let me make sure. The maximum of \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) is indeed \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). Because \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( \phi = \arctan(b/a) \) or something like that. So, the maximum is when \( \cos(\theta - \phi) = 1 \), so the maximum is \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).

In our case, the expression is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). So, \( a = 324 \), \( b = -432 \).

So, the maximum real part is \( \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Let me compute that.

First, compute \( 324^2 \):

324 * 324: Let's compute 300^2 = 90,000, 24^2=576, and cross term 2*300*24=14,400.

So, (300+24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 105, 976? Wait, no: 90k +14.4k is 104.4k, plus 576 is 104,976. So 324^2 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: Let's compute 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, and cross term 2*400*32=2
