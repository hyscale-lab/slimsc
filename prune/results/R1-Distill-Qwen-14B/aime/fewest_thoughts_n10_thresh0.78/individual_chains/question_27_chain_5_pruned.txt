Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is in the same plane as the circle but 6 units away from the center. So, when you rotate it, the distance from the center of the original circle to the axis is 6, and the radius of the circle itself is 3. That probably means the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube) is 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside and the outside of this sphere, and in each case, they are tangent along a circle. I need to find the radii of these circles of tangency, r_i when it's inside and r_o when it's outside, and then compute the difference r_i - r_o. The answer should be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, they're tangent along another circle. I'm trying to imagine how these two cases would work.

Let me recall some geometry. A torus can be described in 3D space with two radii: R is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus (the major radius), and r is the radius of the tube itself (the minor radius). In this case, R is 6 and r is 3.

The sphere has a radius of 11. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center is fixed, and the torus is placed such that it's just touching the sphere internally. Similarly, when it's outside, the torus is placed such that it's touching the sphere externally.

I think the key here is to find the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus in each case, and then relate that to the radii of the circles where they're tangent.

Wait, but the torus is a surface of revolution. So, perhaps the centers are aligned along the axis of revolution. Let me think: the sphere is a perfectly symmetrical object, so when the torus is tangent to it, the center of the sphere, the center of the torus's generating circle, and the point of tangency should lie along the same line.

Hmm, perhaps for both internal and external tangency, the line connecting the centers of the sphere and the torus's center is the same as the axis of the torus.

Wait, maybe not. The torus's center is the center of the tube, which is offset from the sphere's center by a certain distance. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center and the torus's center are separated by some distance d_i, and when it's outside, the separation is d_o.

I think I need to find d_i and d_o for the two cases of tangency.

Wait, but how does that help me find the radii of the circles where they're tangent?

Let me think in terms of cross-sections. If I take a cross-sectional slice through the axis of the torus and the center of the sphere, I should see two circles: one representing the sphere and the other representing the major circle of the torus.

In the cross-section, the sphere would be a circle of radius 11. The torus's cross-section would look like two circles, each of radius 3, centered at a distance of 6 from the torus's center. Wait, no: the cross-section through the axis of a torus would actually look like a circle of radius R (6) with another circle of radius r (3) around it, but in this cross-section, it's like a larger circle with a smaller circle inside.

Wait, maybe not. Let me correct that. The cross-section of a torus along its axis is actually an annulus. The major radius is R = 6, and the minor radius is r = 3. So, in cross-section, it's a ring with inner radius R - r = 3 and outer radius R + r = 9.

Wait, that makes sense because the torus is formed by rotating a circle of radius r around an axis at a distance R from the center. So, in cross-section along the axis, you'd see a circle of radius R (6) with another circle of radius r (3) attached at a point, making an annulus from 3 to 9.

So, in the cross-sectional view, the torus is represented by an annulus from 3 to 9, and the sphere is a circle of radius 11.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, the cross-section would show the annulus (from 3 to 9) inside the sphere's circle (radius 11). The point of tangency would be where the outer edge of the annulus touches the inner part of the sphere's circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, the inner edge of the annulus would touch the sphere's outer edge.

Wait, but I think that's not quite accurate. Because in 3D, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus's surface just touches the sphere at some points. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, touching it at some points.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the cross-section. Let's model the sphere as a circle of radius 11, and the torus's cross-section as an annulus from 3 to 9. So, in this cross-section, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's circle (radius 11) would enclose the annulus (which goes from 3 to 9). The point of tangency would occur where the outer edge of the annulus (radius 9) meets the sphere's inner surface.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the sphere's radius is 11, so the outer edge of the ann
