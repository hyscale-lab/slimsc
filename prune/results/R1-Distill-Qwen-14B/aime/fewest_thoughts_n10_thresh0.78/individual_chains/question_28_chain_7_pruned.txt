Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a special point inside it to each of its faces. That point is called the incenter, I think, similar to the incenter in a triangle. The distance should be equal to all faces, so it's like the radius of the inscribed sphere or something.

First, let me write down the given edge lengths:

- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

Hmm, that's interesting. So each pair of opposite edges has the same length. I remember that in a tetrahedron, if all opposite edges are equal, it's called an isosceles tetrahedron or a disphenoid. I think properties of disphenoids might help here.

I recall that in a disphenoid, the inradius can be calculated using the formula:

r = (3V) / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area.

So, I need to find the volume V and the surface area S of this tetrahedron.

But wait, how do I compute the volume when all I know are the edge lengths? Maybe I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant? I remember that's a formula that gives the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths. Let me recall the formula.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

det = | 0 1 1 1 1 |
       | 1 0 a² b² c² |
       | 1 a² 0 d² e² |
       | 1 b² d² 0 f² |
       | 1 c² e² f² 0 |

The volume V is then sqrt(det / 288). But since determinants can get complicated, maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, since this is a disphenoid, perhaps I can find the volume by another method. In a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, is that true? Let me think. If opposite edges are equal, then each pair of opposite faces should be congruent, but not necessarily all four. Wait, in this case, all opposite edges are equal, so maybe all faces are congruent? Because each face is a triangle with edges of two different lengths. Let me check:

Each face is a triangle with edges:

- For face ABC: edges AB = √41, AC = √80, BC = √89.
- For face ABD: edges AB = √41, AD = √89, BD = √80.
- For face ACD: edges AC = √80, CD = √41, AD = √89.
- For face BCD: edges BC = √89, CD = √41, BD = √80.

Wait, so each face has the same three edge lengths: √41, √80, √89. So all four faces are congruent triangles, making this a regular-faced tetrahedron? Not necessarily regular, because the edges are different, but each face is the same.

So, if all faces are congruent, then they have the same area. So, if I can compute the area of one face, I can just multiply by four to get the surface area S.

Let me compute the area of triangle ABC. The sides are √41, √80, √89. I can use Heron's formula for this.

First, compute the semi-perimeter s:

s = (√41 +
