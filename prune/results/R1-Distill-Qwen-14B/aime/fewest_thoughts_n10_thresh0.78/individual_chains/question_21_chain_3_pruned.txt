Okay, so I've got this problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to understand what it means. 

The problem says: For an integer b ≥ 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when you express n in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

They also gave an example: 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. Got it.

Our goal is to find the least integer b ≥ 2 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, we need to find the smallest base b where there are at least 11 such numbers n that satisfy the two conditions.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's formalize the conditions mathematically. 

If n is a two-digit number in base b, that means it can be expressed as:
n = a * b + c,
where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a cannot be zero. So, a must be at least 1, and c can be from 0 to b-1. 

The second condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers, right? Hence, n must be a perfect square. 

Wait, so n is a two-digit number in base b, and it's a perfect square whose square root is the sum of its two digits in base b.

So, let's denote k = sqrt(n). Then, n = k², and we have:
k = a + c.

But since n = a*b + c, we can write:
k² = a*b + c.

But since k = a + c, we can substitute c = k - a into the equation:
k² = a*b + (k - a).

Simplify that:
k² = a*b + k - a
k² - k = a*(b - 1)
So, a = (k² - k)/(b - 1)

Hmm, interesting. So, a is expressed in terms of k and b. Since a must be a digit in base b, it's an integer, and 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1.

So, for a given b, the possible values of k will determine the possible a and c, which in turn determine n.

Our goal is to find the smallest b such that the number of valid (a, c) pairs is more than ten, i.e., at least eleven.

So, perhaps the approach is to iterate over possible values of b, starting from 2 upwards, and for each b, determine how many valid k's exist such that the corresponding a is an integer between 1 and b-1, and c = k - a is between 0 and b-1.

But how do we approach this systematically?

Let me think about the constraints for each variable.

We have:
1. a = (k² - k)/(b - 1)
2. a must be an integer between 1 and b-1 inclusive.
3. c = k - a must be between 0 and b-1 inclusive.

So, for each b, we can find all integers k such that (k² - k) is divisible by (b - 1), and a is within 1 to b-1, and c is within 0 to b-1.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to fix k and find the possible b that satisfy the equation. But since we're looking for the minimal b, maybe it's better to go through each b and count the number of valid k's.

But since b can be up to a certain size, we need a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps we can find a relationship between k and b. From a = (k² - k)/(b - 1), we can see that (b - 1) must divide (k² - k). So, (b - 1) | (k² - k). 

Which implies that (b - 1) is a divisor of k(k - 1). Since k and k-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. So, the divisors of k(k-1) are the products of the divisors of k and the divisors of k-1.

Hmm, that might complicate things a bit. Maybe another approach.

Let me think about the equation k² = a*b + c, and c = k - a.

Substituting, we get k² = a*b + (k - a). Rearranged, k² - k = a*(b - 1), as before.

So, a = (k² - k)/(b - 1). Since a must be a positive integer, (k² - k) must be positive, so k ≥ 2 (since k=1 gives 0, which would make a=0, which is invalid since a is the first digit and can't be zero).

So, k starts from 2.

But also, since a must be ≤ b - 1, we have:

(k² - k)/(b - 1) ≤ b - 1
=> k² - k ≤ (b - 1)^2
=> k² - k - (b - 1)^2 ≤ 0

Which is a quadratic inequality in terms of k. Depending on b, this will limit the possible values of k.

But perhaps instead of trying to bound k for each b, it's better to iterate over possible k and find the corresponding b's.

Wait, but the problem is to find the minimal b with at least 11 such n's. So, perhaps for each b, we can find the number of k's that satisfy the conditions.

But doing this for each b might be time-consuming, but since we're looking for the minimal b, maybe start from b=2 and go up, counting for each b how many valid k's exist, until we find a b with more than ten.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a general formula for the number of solutions in terms of b.

Let me think about it.

Given that a = (k² - k)/(b - 1), and a must be at least 1 and at most b-1.

So, 1 ≤ (k² - k)/(b - 1) ≤ b - 1

Which implies:

b - 1 ≤ k² - k ≤ (b - 1)^2

Wait, no, wait: Let me correct that.

If (k² - k)/(b - 1) ≥ 1, then k² - k ≥ b - 1.

And (k² - k)/(b - 1) ≤ b - 1 implies k² - k ≤ (b - 1)^2.

So, for each b, the possible k's must satisfy:

b - 1 ≤ k² - k ≤ (b - 1)^2

This is a quadratic inequality in k. Let's solve for k.

Let me write:

k² - k - (b - 1) ≥ 0

and

k² - k - (b - 1)^2 ≤ 0

Solving the first inequality:

k² - k - (b - 1) ≥ 0

This is a quadratic in k: k² - k - c ≥ 0, where c = b -1.

The roots are [1 ± sqrt(1 + 4c)]/2.

Similarly, the second inequality:

k² - k - (b - 1)^2 ≤ 0

Again, quadratic in k: k² - k - d ≤ 0, where d = (b-1)^2.

The roots are [1 ± sqrt(1 + 4d)]/2.

So, the possible k's lie between the positive roots of these quadratics.

But perhaps this is getting a bit too abstract. Maybe it's better to look for an expression that relates k and b in a way that we can find the number of k's for each b.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider that a must be an integer, so (k² -k) must be divisible by (b -1). So, for each b, the number of valid k's is the number of integers k such that (b-1) divides k² - k, and a = (k² -k)/(b-1) is between 1 and b-1, and c = k - a is between 0 and b-1.

So, for each b, we can think of (b-1
