Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the product xy, given that both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me see if I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be rewritten using the change of base formula. Maybe that could help me connect these two equations. The change of base formula says that log_b(a) = (ln a)/(ln b), where ln is the natural logarithm. So, maybe I can rewrite both equations in terms of natural logs and see if I can find a relationship between x and y.

Let me write down the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the logarithm power rule, which says that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a), I can simplify this. So, log_x(y^x) becomes x * log_x(y). So the equation is x * log_x(y) = 10.

Now, applying the change of base formula to log_x(y), that would be (ln y)/(ln x). So substituting that into the equation, I get x * (ln y)/(ln x) = 10. I can write that as (x * ln y)/(ln x) = 10. Let me note that as equation (1).

Moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, using the power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x). So, 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Again, applying the change of base formula to log_y(x), that's (ln x)/(ln y). So, substituting that in, I get 4y * (ln x)/(ln y) = 10. Let me call this equation (2).

Now I have two equations:

(1) (x * ln y)/(ln x) = 10

(2) 4y * (ln x)/(ln y) = 10

Hmm, I notice that equation (1) has (x * ln y)/(ln x) and equation (2) has (4y * ln x)/(ln y). Maybe I can denote (ln x)/(ln y) as some variable to simplify things. Let's say k = (ln x)/(ln y). Then, (ln y)/(ln x) would be 1/k.

Substituting into equation (1): x * (1/k) = 10 → x = 10k.

Similarly, equation (2) becomes 4y * k = 10 → 4y k = 10 → y = (10)/(4k) = (5)/(2k).

So now I have expressions for x and y in terms of k: x = 10k and y = 5/(2k). That's helpful because now I can express both variables in terms of a single variable, k.

But wait, I also know that k = (ln x)/(ln y). Let me write that out: k = (ln x)/(ln y). Since x =10k and y =5/(2k), I can substitute those into the expression for k.

So, substituting:

k = (ln (10k)) / (ln (5/(2k)))

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it. Let me write it as:

k = [ln(10k)] / [ln(5/(2k))]

Let me denote that as equation (3): k = [ln(10k)] / [ln(5/(2k))]

This equation has only k in it, so if I can solve for k, I can find x and y.

Hmm, solving for k here might be a bit tricky. Let me think about how to approach this. Perhaps cross-multiplying the equation to get rid of the fraction.

So, equation (3):

k = [ln(10k)] / [ln(5/(2k))]

Multiply both sides by ln(5/(2k)):

k * ln(5/(2k)) = ln(10k)

Hmm, that gives me an equation where k is on both sides, inside logarithms and multiplied by another logarithm. This seems a bit complex, but maybe I can make a substitution to simplify it.

Let me let t = k, so that I can see if I can express the equation in a more manageable form.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I can express both sides in terms of ln(10) and ln(5) and ln(2). Let me try expanding ln(10k) and ln(5/(2k)).

Starting with the right-hand side: ln(10k) = ln(10) + ln(k)

Left-hand side: ln(5/(2k)) = ln(5) - ln(2k) = ln(5) - (ln 2 + ln k)

So, substituting back into equation (3):

k * [ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(k)] = ln(10) + ln(k)

Let me expand the left side:

k * ln(5) - k * ln(2) - k * ln(k) = ln(10) + ln(k)

Hmm, okay. Let me collect like terms. Bring all terms to one side.

k * ln(5) - k * ln(2) - k * ln(k) - ln(10) - ln(k) = 0

Factor terms where possible. Let's see:

The terms with ln(5) and ln(2) are linear in k. The terms with ln(k) are multiplied by k and 1. Hmm.

Alternatively, let me factor terms involving ln(k):

- (k + 1) * ln(k) + k*(ln5 - ln2) - ln(10) = 0

Hmm, that might be a way to write it. Let me note that ln5 - ln2 is ln(5/2). So:

- (k + 1) ln(k) + k * ln(5/2) - ln(10) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can factor ln(10) as ln(5*2) = ln5 + ln2.

Wait, let me write out all the constants:

ln(10) = ln(2) + ln(5). So, substituting that in:

- (k + 1) ln(k) + k ln(5/2) - (ln2 + ln5) = 0

Hmm, maybe I can group the ln5 and ln2 terms.

So, let's see:

- (k + 1) ln(k) + k ln(5/2) - ln2 - ln5 = 0

Let me rearrange the terms:

= [k ln(5/2) - ln5] + [ - (k + 1) ln(k) - ln2 ] = 0

Not sure if that's helpful, but perhaps I can factor ln5 and ln2 terms:

k ln(5/2) = k (ln5 - ln2), so:

= k (ln5 - ln2) - ln5 - (k + 1) ln(k) - ln2 = 0

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor ln5 and ln2.

Let me collect terms with ln5:

ln5 (k - 1) 

And terms with ln2:

- ln2 (k + 1)

So, putting it together:

ln5 (k - 1) - ln2 (k + 1) - (k + 1) ln(k) = 0

Hmm, that's another way to look at it.

But I'm not sure if this is leading me anywhere. Maybe I need to consider a substitution or another approach.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to solve for k directly, I can assume that k is a power of some base. For instance, maybe k is a multiple or fraction that makes the equations work out.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the equation in terms of exponents. Let me take both sides of equation (3):

k = [ln(10k)] / [ln(5/(2k))]

Exponentiating both sides with base e:

e^{k} = e^{ [ln(10k)] / [ln(5/(2k))] }

Wait, that seems a bit messy, but maybe I can manipulate it.

Alternatively, maybe I can write 10k and 5/(2k) in terms of some variable substitution.

Let me denote t = k, then 10k = 10t and 5/(2k) = 5/(2t). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps setting t = 2k. Let me try that. Let t = 2k, so then k = t/2.

Substituting into x and y:

x =10k =5t

y =5/(2k) =5/(t)

So, x =5t, y=5/t.

So, now, with this substitution, maybe I can find a relationship.

But now, let's see if I can express k in terms of t. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, let me think about whether x and y have any reciprocal relationship given x=5t and y=5/t. So maybe x*y =5t*(5/t)=25. Hmm, wait, that's 25. So, is xy=25?

Wait, wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct.

Because if x =5t and y=5/t, then xy= (5t)*(5/t) =25. So yes, regardless of the value of t, xy is 25.

Wait, hold on. Is that possible? Because I haven't used all the information yet. I assumed t=2k, which led to x=5t and y=5/t. But is that substitution valid?

Wait, I think I might have made a substitution that didn't account for all constraints. Because x and y are expressed in terms of k, which in turn is expressed through the logarithmic equation. So, does this substitution actually satisfy the logarithmic equation?

Wait, maybe I can test whether xy=25 is the solution.

If xy=25, then perhaps we can find x and y such that their product is 25 and that satisfies the original logarithmic equations.

But let me verify this. If xy=25, then y=25/x.

Let me plug this into the original equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x)=10.

Since y=25/x, then y^x = (25/x)^x.

So, log_x((25/x)^x) =10.

Using the power rule for logarithms, this is x * log_x(25/x) =10.

Simplify log_x(25/x): log_x(25) - log_x(x) = log_x(25) -1.

So, equation becomes x*(log_x(25) -1) =10.

Hmm, log_x(25) can be written as (ln25)/(lnx). So, substituting that:

x*( (ln25)/(lnx) -1 ) =10.

Let me write it as:

x*(ln25 - lnx)/lnx =10.

Wait, that's because (ln25)/(lnx) -1 = (ln25 - lnx)/lnx.

So, x*(ln25 - lnx)/lnx =10.

Hmm, let me write that as:

x*(ln(25/x))/lnx =10.

Wait, that's similar to the earlier steps. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can let u = lnx. Then, let me try that substitution.

Let u = lnx. Then, lny = ln(25/x) = ln25 - lnx = ln25 - u.

So, equation (1) becomes:

x*(ln25 - u)/u =10.

But, since u = lnx, x = e^u.

So, substituting x = e^u into the equation:

e^u * (ln25 - u)/u =10.

Hmm, that looks complicated. Maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, let me go back to the second equation. If xy=25, then y=25/x.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10.

Again, substituting y=25/x, we get:

log_{25/x}(x^{4*(25/x)}) =10.

Simplify the exponent: 4*(25/x) =100/x.

So, log_{25/x}(x^{100/x})=10.

Using the power rule again: (100/x)* log_{25/x}(x) =10.

So, (100/x) * log_{25/x}(x) =10.

Simplify log_{25/x}(x). Let me write that as 1 / log_x(25/x) because log_b(a) = 1/log_a(b).

So, log_{25/x}(x) = 1 / log_x(25/x). Let me compute log_x(25/x):

log_x(25/x) = log_x(25) - log_x(x) = log_x(25) -1. So, log_{25/x}(x) =1/(log_x(25)-1).

So, substituting back into the equation:

(100/x) * [1/(log_x(25) -1)] =10.

So, (100/x) / (log_x(25) -1) =10.

Multiply both sides by (log_x(25) -1):

100/x =10*(log_x(25)-1)

Divide both sides by 10:

10/x = log_x(25) -1

Rearranged:

log_x(25) = (10/x) +1

Hmm, so now we have two expressions involving log_x(25).

From equation (1):

log_x(25/x) =10/x

Wait, no, let me check. From equation (1), after substitution, we had:

x*(log_x(25) -1) =10.

Which is:

x*log_x(25) -x =10.

Similarly, from the second equation, we just found:

log_x(25) = (10/x) +1.

So, let me substitute log_x(25) from the second equation into the first equation.

So, in equation (1):

x*( [10/x +1] ) -x =10.

Let me compute that:

x*(10/x +1) -x =10.

Simplify x*(10/x) =10, so:

10 + x -x =10.

Which simplifies to 10=10. Hmm, that's an identity, which suggests that the substitution xy=25 is consistent with both equations.

But wait, does that mean that xy=25 is the only solution, or is this just a coincidence?

Because when I substituted xy=25, it led to a tautology, which means that as long as xy=25, both equations are satisfied. So, does that mean that xy must be 25?

Wait, but how did I get that xy=25 in the first place? I made a substitution t=2k, which led to x=5t and y=5/t, which gives xy=25. But I need to ensure that this substitution is valid, meaning that the original logarithmic equations hold.

Wait, but when I tested substituting y=25/x into both logarithmic equations, they both reduced to identities, suggesting that any x and y such that xy=25 would satisfy the equations. But that can't be right because logarithms are specific functions and usually only certain values would satisfy the equations.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my substitution. Let me double-check.

I let t=2k, which led to x=10k=5t and y=5/(2k)=5/t. So x=5t and y=5/t. Then, indeed, x*y=25. So, with this substitution, any t>0 would lead to x and y such that x*y=25.

But wait, the original problem states that x and y are greater than 1. So, t must be such that x=5t>1 and y=5/t>1.

So, x=5t>1 → t>1/5.

y=5/t>1 → t<5.

So, t must be between 1/5 and 5. So, t is in (1/5,5).

But that doesn't necessarily pin down t; it just restricts t's range. But from the original equations, we might have more constraints on t.

Wait, but when I substituted y=25/x into the equations, they reduced to identities, meaning that for any x>1 and y=25/x>1, the equations hold. But that can't be because, for example, if x=2, y=12.5, let's test the original equations.

First equation: log_2(12.5^2) = log_2(156.25) ≈ log_2(128)=7, but 156.25 is 2^7.25? Wait, 2^7=128, 2^7.25=128*sqrt(2^0.25) ≈128*1.189≈152. Not exactly 156.25, so it's not 7.25. So, log_2(156.25) is not an integer, let alone 10.

So, my earlier conclusion that any x and y with xy=25 satisfy the equations must be wrong. Therefore, my substitution approach might have an error.

Wait, so perhaps assuming that x*y=25 is not sufficient, and that we need a more precise relationship.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me go back.

Earlier, I set k = ln x / ln y. Then, I set t = 2k, leading to x=5t and y=5/t. Then, I concluded that x*y=25. But perhaps that substitution was arbitrary, and I should not have introduced t without justification.

Wait, perhaps I should not use substitution but instead try to solve for k numerically or find a relationship that allows me to write an equation solely in terms of k.

Looking back at equation (3):

k = [ln(10k)] / [ln(5/(2k))]

Let me write this as:

k = ln(10k) / ln(5/(2k))

Let me compute both the numerator and denominator numerically for some trial values of k to see if I can find a value that satisfies this equation.

Let me denote f(k) = ln(10k) / ln(5/(2k)).

We need to find k such that f(k)=k.

Let me try k=2:

Numerator: ln(20) ≈ 2.9957

Denominator: ln(5/(4))=ln(1.25)≈0.2231

So, f(2)=2.9957 / 0.2231≈13.428. Which is much larger than k=2.

Hmm, so f(k) is much larger than k at k=2.

Let me try k=3:

Numerator: ln(30)≈3.4012

Denominator: ln(5/6)=ln(0.8333)≈-0.1823

So, f(k)=3.4012 / (-0.1823)≈-18.66, which is negative and much less than k=3.

Hmm, so f(k) is negative here.

Wait, but k is (ln x)/(ln y). Since x and y are both greater than 1, ln x and ln y are positive, so k must be positive.

So, in denominator, ln(5/(2k)) must be positive, because otherwise f(k) would be negative. So, ln(5/(2k))>0 → 5/(2k) >1 → 5/(2k) >1 → 2k <5 → k<2.5.

So, k must be less than 2.5 for the denominator to be positive.

So, if k<2.5, let's try k=2:

Wait, I did that earlier, f(k)=13.4. So, f(k) > k.

Wait, but when k is approaching 2.5 from below, denominator approaches ln(5/(5))=ln(1)=0, so f(k) approaches infinity.

At k=1:

Numerator: ln(10*1)=ln(10)=2.3026

Denominator: ln(5/(2*1))=ln(2.5)≈0.9163

f(1)=2.3026/0.9163≈2.514.

So, f(1)=2.514>1.

At k=2, f(k)=13.4>2.

Hmm, seems like f(k) is always greater than k for k<2.5.

Wait, but we need f(k)=k. So, when does ln(10k)/ln(5/(2k))=k?

I can set this up as an equation:

ln(10k) = k * ln(5/(2k))

Hmm, perhaps I can compute both sides numerically for various k between 1 and 2.5.

Let me try k=2 again:

Left side: ln(20)=2.9957

Right side: 2 * ln(5/4)=2 * 0.2231≈0.4462

So, 2.9957 ≈ 0.4462? No, not equal.

k=1.5:

Left: ln(15)=2.7080

Right: 1.5 * ln(5/3)=1.5 * ln(1.6667)=1.5 *0.5108≈0.7662

Not equal.

k=1.2:

Left: ln(12)=2.4849

Right:1.2 * ln(5/2.4)=1.2 * ln(2.0833)=1.2 *0.7333≈0.8799

Not equal.

k=0.5:

Left: ln(5)=1.6094

Right:0.5 * ln(5/1)=0.5 * ln5≈0.5*1.6094≈0.8047

Not equal.

Wait, perhaps I need a better approach. Let's try to write the equation:

ln(10k) = k * ln(5/(2k)).

Let me write that as:

ln(10k) = k * [ln5 - ln(2k)].

So, ln(10k) = k ln5 - k ln(2k).

But ln(10k)=ln10 + lnk, so:

ln10 + lnk = k ln5 -k(ln2 + lnk).

Expanding the right side:

= k ln5 -k ln2 -k lnk.

So, bringing all terms to the left:

ln10 + lnk -k ln5 +k ln2 +k lnk =0.

Hmm, it's a transcendental equation, which may not have a solution in terms of elementary functions. So, perhaps we can try to find an approximate solution numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a nice integer or rational value of k that satisfies this equation.

Let me try k=2.

Left side: ln(20)=2.9957

Right side: 2*ln(5/4)=2*(0.2231)=0.4462. Not equal.

k=3: ln(30)=3.4012, 3*ln(5/6)=3*(-0.1823)= -0.5469. Not equal.

k=1: ln(10)=2.3026, 1*ln(5/2)=1*(0.9163)=0.9163. Not equal.

k=4: But wait, k must be less than 2.5, so 4 is invalid.

k=1. Let's see, at k=1, left side is ln(10)=2.3026, right side is ln(5/2)=0.9163. So, not equal.

Wait, perhaps k=1/2.

ln(5)=1.6094, right side: (1/2)*ln(5/(1))= (1/2)*1.6094=0.8047. Not equal.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange the equation:

ln(10k) +k ln(2k) =k ln5.

So, ln(10k) +k ln(2k) =k ln5.

Hmm, let's see:

ln(10k) +k (ln2 + lnk) =k ln5.

So,

ln10 + lnk +k ln2 +k lnk =k ln5.

Let me group terms:

ln10 + lnk +k ln2 +k lnk -k ln5 =0.

Hmm, perhaps factor terms with k:

ln10 + lnk +k (ln2 + lnk - ln5) =0.

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can express terms as exponents.

Let me define this as:

A = ln10 + lnk,

B =k (ln2 + lnk - ln5),

so equation is A + B =0.

But I don't see an obvious way to solve this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can try to guess a value of k where both sides might be equal. Let me suppose that k=1/ln(10), which is approximately 0.4343.

Wait, let's compute left and right sides for k=0.4343.

Left side: ln(10 *0.4343)=ln(4.343)=1.468.

Right side: 0.4343 * ln(5/(2*0.4343)).

Compute denominator inside ln: 5/(0.8686)=5.745.

So, ln(5.745)=1.748.

Multiply by 0.4343: 0.4343 *1.748≈0.761.

So, left side is 1.468, right side 0.761. Not equal.

Hmm, maybe another guess. Let's try k=0.6.

Left side: ln(6)=1.7918.

Right side:0.6 * ln(5/(1.2))=0.6 * ln(4.1667)=0.6*(1.427)=0.856.

Nope, not equal.

k=0.7.

Left: ln(7)=1.9459.

Right:0.7 * ln(5/(1.4))=0.7 * ln(3.571)=0.7*(1.271)=0.890.

Still not equal.

k=0.8.

Left: ln(8)=2.079.

Right:0.8*ln(5/(1.6))=0.8*ln(3.125)=0.8*(1.144)=0.915.

Not equal.

k=0.9.

Left: ln(9)=2.1972.

Right:0.9 * ln(5/(1.8))=0.9*ln(2.7778)=0.9*(1.021)=0.919.

Hmm, 2.1972≈0.919? No.

k=0.95.

Left: ln(9.5)=2.2518.

Right:0.95 * ln(5/(1.9))=0.95*ln(2.6316)=0.95*(0.966)=0.918.

Still no.

k=1.0.

Left: ln(10)=2.3026.

Right:1.0 * ln(5/2)=1.0*(0.9163)=0.9163.

No.

Wait, perhaps I need a better approach. Maybe I can define a function f(k) = ln(10k) -k ln(5/(2k)) and find where f(k)=0.

Let me compute f(k) for different k:

At k=1:

f(1)=ln(10) -1*ln(5/2)=2.3026 -0.9163≈1.3863.

At k=2:

f(2)=ln(20) -2*ln(5/4)=2.9957 -2*(0.2231)=2.9957 -0.446≈2.5497.

At k=0.5:

f(0.5)=ln(5) -0.5*ln(5/(1))=1.6094 -0.5*(1.6094)=1.6094 -0.8047≈0.8047.

At k=0.25:

f(0.25)=ln(2.5)=0.9163 -0.25*ln(5/0.5)=0.9163 -0.25*ln(10)=0.9163 -0.25*2.3026≈0.9163 -0.5757≈0.3406.

At k approaching 0:

As k approaches 0, ln(10k) approaches negative infinity, while the other term approaches k*ln(infinity)=positive infinity. So, f(k) approaches negative infinity.

Wait, but f(k) is positive at k=0.5, 1, 2, etc. So, where does it cross zero?

Wait, actually, when k approaches 0+, ln(10k) approaches -infinity, and k ln(5/(2k)) approaches k*(ln(5/(0)))=k*ln(inf)=k*inf≈0*inf, which is an indeterminate form. But in reality, 5/(2k) goes to infinity, so ln(5/(2k)) approaches infinity, but k approaches zero. So, k*ln(5/(2k)) approaches zero * infinity. Let me compute the limit.

lim_{k→0+} k ln(5/(2k)).

Let me set t=1/k, so as k→0+, t→infty.

Then, lim_{t→infty} (1/t) ln(5t/2) = lim (ln(5t/2))/t.

Which is lim (ln t + ln(5/2))/t →0 as t→infty.

So, the limit is zero.

So, f(k)=ln(10k) -k ln(5/(2k)) → -infty -0 = -infty as k→0+.

At k=0.25, f(k)=0.3406>0.

So, somewhere between k=0 and k=0.25, f(k) transitions from -infty to positive 0.3406, so by Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a root in (0, 0.25).

Similarly, let's check at k=0.1:

f(0.1)=ln(1) -0.1*ln(5/0.2)=0 -0.1*ln(25)= -0.1*3.2189≈-0.3219.

So, f(0.1)= -0.3219.

k=0.15:

f(0.15)=ln(1.5)=0.4055 -0.15*ln(5/(0.3))=0.4055 -0.15*ln(16.6667)=0.4055 -0.15*(2.820)=0.4055 -0.423≈-0.0175.

Close to zero.

k=0.16:

f(0.16)=ln(1.6)=0.4700 -0.16*ln(5/(0.32))=0.4700 -0.16*ln(15.625)=0.4700 -0.16*(2.7465)=0.4700 -0.4394≈0.0306.

So, between k=0.15 and 0.16, f(k) crosses zero.

Using linear approximation between k=0.15 (f=-0.0175) and k=0.16 (f=0.0306).

Slope: (0.0306 - (-0.0175))/(0.16 -0.15)= (0.0481)/0.01=4.81 per 0.01.

We need delta_k where f(k)=0: delta_k= (0 - (-0.0175))/4.81≈0.0175/4.81≈0.0036.

So, root at approximately k=0.15 +0.0036=0.1536.

So, k≈0.1536.

Now, with this k, we can find x and y.

x=10k≈10*0.1536≈1.536.

y=5/(2k)=5/(2*0.1536)=5/0.3072≈16.276.

So, x≈1.536, y≈16.276.

Then, xy≈1.536 *16.276≈25.000.

Hmm, exactly 25? That's interesting. So, despite the approximate value of k, the product xy comes out to exactly 25.

So, even though k is approximately 0.1536, the product xy is exactly 25.

Wait, that's consistent with my earlier substitution where I assumed t=2k, leading to x=5t and y=5/t, hence xy=25. So, even though k is not an integer, the product xy remains 25.

So, perhaps despite the complex relationship between x and y, their product is always 25.

Therefore, the answer is 25.

But wait, earlier I thought that any x and y with xy=25 would satisfy the equations, but when I tried x=2, y=12.5, the equations didn't hold. But with this specific k, x≈1.536 and y≈16.276, it does hold.

So, perhaps the only solution is xy=25, but with x and y specifically determined by the equations. So, regardless of the values of x and y, their product is 25.

So, the answer is 25.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given logarithmic equations:

1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\)
2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\)

Using the logarithm power rule, we rewrite the first equation as:
\[
x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10
\]
Applying the change of base formula, \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\ln y}{\ln x}\), we get:
\[
x \cdot \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{x \ln y}{\ln x} = 10 \quad \text{(1)}
\]

Similarly, the second equation becomes:
\[
4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10
\]
Using the change of base formula again, \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\ln x}{\ln y}\), we get:
\[
4y \cdot \frac{\ln x}{\ln y} = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{4y \ln x}{\ln y} = 10 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

Let \(k = \frac{\ln x}{\ln y}\). Then, \(\frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = \frac{1}{k}\). Substituting into equations (1) and (2):

From (1):
\[
x \cdot \frac{1}{k} = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 10k
\]

From (2):
\[
4y \cdot k = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = \frac{10}{4k} = \frac{5}{2k}
\]

Now, we have \(x = 10k\) and \(y = \frac{5}{2k}\). The product \(xy\) is:
\[
xy = (10k) \cdot \left(\frac{5}{2k}\right) = \frac{50k}{2k} = 25
\]

Thus, the product \(xy\) is consistently found to be 25, regardless of the specific value of \(k\). This satisfies both original logarithmic equations, confirming that \(xy = 25\).

**Answer:** \(\boxed{25}\)
