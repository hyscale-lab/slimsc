Okay, let me try to solve this probability problem step by step. So, Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize, expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then compute m + n.

Hmm. So, this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize (which is equivalent to having all four numbers match), and event B is winning a prize (having at least two numbers match). So, the probability we're looking for is P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B), because if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize, so A is a subset of B.

Alternatively, since A is a subset of B, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, yes, P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B).

So, first, I need to compute P(A), the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen. Then, compute P(B), the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. Then, divide them to get the conditional probability.

Let me compute these probabilities step by step.

First, the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from S, which has 10 elements, is C(10,4). So, the total number of possible lottery outcomes is C(10,4). 

C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, total possible outcomes: 210.

Jen is picking one specific set of 4 numbers, so the number of favorable outcomes for event A is 1. Therefore, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Now, we need to compute P(B), the probability that at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. To find this, it's often easier to compute the complement probability and subtract from 1.

The complement of event B is that fewer than two of her numbers are chosen, i.e., zero or one of her numbers are chosen. So, P(B) = 1 - P(B') where B' is the event that at most one number matches.

So, P(B') is the probability that zero or one of Jen's numbers are chosen.

Let me compute P(B'):

Number of ways to choose 4 numbers with none of Jen's numbers: Since Jen has 4 numbers, the remaining numbers are 10 - 4 = 6. So, the number of ways is C(6,4).

Similarly, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with exactly one of Jen's numbers: Choose 1 from her 4 numbers and 3 from the remaining 6. So, that's C(4,1)*C(6,3).

Therefore, total ways for B' is C(4,0)*C(6,4) + C(4,1)*C(6,3).

Compute each term:

C(4,0)*C(6,4) = 1 * 15 = 15.

C(4,1)*C(6,3)= 4 * 20 = 80.

So, total B' ways: 15 + 80 = 95.

Therefore, P(B') = 95 / 210.

Hence, P(B) = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210.

Simplify 115/210: both are divisible by 5. 115 ÷5 =23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. So, P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check the calculation for P(B').

Wait, when calculating the number of ways with exactly one of Jen's numbers, it's C(4,1)*C(6,3). C(6,3) is 20, so 4*20=80. And C(6,4)=15. So, 15 + 80=95. That seems correct.

So, 95 ways where at most one number is selected. Therefore, 210 -95=115 ways where at least two numbers are selected. So, P(B)=115/210=23/42.

So, now, P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B) = (1/210)/(23/42). Let me compute this.

First, invert and multiply: (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1)/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, because 42 divides into 210 exactly 5 times (
