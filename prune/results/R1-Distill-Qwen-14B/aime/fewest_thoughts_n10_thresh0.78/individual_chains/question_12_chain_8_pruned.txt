Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me. Let me try to understand it step by step. It's about filling a 2x3 grid with digits so that two conditions are satisfied. The first condition is that when you read the numbers left to right, their sum is 999. The second condition is that when you read the numbers top to bottom, their sum is 99. 

Let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so there are two rows and three columns. Each cell will have a single digit (0-9). When reading left to right, each row becomes a three-digit number. So the top row forms one number, say ABC, and the bottom row forms another number, say DEF. Then, ABC + DEF should equal 999. 

Similarly, when reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. The first column is A and D, forming AD. The second column is B and E, forming BE. The third column is C and F, forming CF. Then, AD + BE + CF should equal 99. 

So, the problem is to find the number of possible ways to fill the grid with digits such that both these conditions are met.

Let me denote the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

So, the first condition is that the sum of the two three-digit numbers abc and def is 999. So, abc + def = 999.

The second condition is that the sum of the three two-digit numbers ad, be, and cf is 99. So, ad + be + cf = 99.

I need to find all possible assignments of digits a, b, c, d, e, f that satisfy both equations.

Let me break it down. Starting with the first condition: abc + def = 999.

Since abc and def are three-digit numbers, their sum is 999. So, let's represent them numerically.

abc = 100a + 10b + c

def = 100d + 10e + f

So, 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999

Let me rearrange terms:

(100a + 100d) + (10b + 10e) + (c + f) = 999

Factor out the common terms:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999

So, 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999

Hmm, interesting. So each of these terms (a+d, b+e, c+f) contributes to the sum. Let me denote:

Let S1 = a + d, S2 = b + e, S3 = c + f

Then, 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999

So, 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999

Which suggests that S1, S2, S3 are digits in the number 999. Wait, no, 999 is a three-digit number. So, 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 must equal 999.

Let me think about this. S1, S2, S3 are sums of digits, so each can be between 0 and 18 (since each digit is 0-9, and adding two digits gives max 9+9=18). But 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

So, 999 divided by 100 is 9.99. So, S1 must be 9 because 100*9=900. Then, 10*S2 + S3 must be 99.

Wait, 100*9 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999

So, 900 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999

Which implies 10*S2 + S3 = 99.

Now, 10*S2 + S3 = 99.

Similarly, S2 and S3 are sums of two digits each, so S2 can be from 0 to 18, and S3 can be from 0 to 18.

So, 10*S2 + S3 = 99. Let me think about possible values of S2 and S3.

Let me denote S3 as 99 - 10*S2.

But since S3 must be between 0 and 18, let's see what possible S2 can be.

Let's solve for S2:

From 10*S2 + S3 = 99,

S3 = 99 - 10*S2.

Since S3 must be >=0 and <=18,

99 -10*S2 >=0 => 10*S2 <=99 => S2 <=9.9, so S2 <=9 (since S2 is integer).

Also, S3 =99-10*S2 <=18:

99 -10*S2 <=18 => 10*S2 >=81 => S2 >=8.1, so S2 >=9 (since S2 is integer).

So S2 must be exactly 9, because S2 has to be between 8.1 and 9.9, but S2 must be integer. So S2=9.

Then, S3=99-10*9=99-90=9.

Thus, S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

So, summarizing:

a + d = 9,

b + e =9,

c + f =9.

That's
