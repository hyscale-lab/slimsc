Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number \( z \) with a fixed modulus can be written in polar form. Since \( |z| = 4 \), I can express \( z \) as \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That might make things easier because multiplying and dividing complex numbers in polar form is straightforward.

So, let me substitute \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression. Then, \( \frac{1}{z} \) would be \( \frac{1}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). 

Now, let's rewrite the original expression with this substitution:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Simplify the terms:

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \)

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \)

So, the expression becomes:

\[
4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

I need to find the real part of this expression. Let me compute each term separately.

Let me denote the first term as \( A = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \) and the second term as \( B = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

So, the expression is \( A + B \), and I need the real part of this, which is \( \text{Re}(A) + \text{Re}(B) \).

Let me compute \( \text{Re}(A) \):

First, \( 4(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i \). So, \( A = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \).

Expressed in terms of Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \).

So, multiplying \( (300 + 468i) \) with \( (\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \):

Using distributive property:

\( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta \)

But \( i^2 = -1 \), so this becomes:

\( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)

Imaginary part: \( (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i \)

Thus, \( \text{Re}(A) = 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \).

Now, let's compute \( \text{Re}(B) \):

\( B = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \)

Similarly, \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So, multiplying \( (24 + 36i) \) with \( (\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \):

\( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta \)

Again, \( i^2 = -1 \), so:

\( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)

Imaginary part: \( (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)i \)

Thus, \( \text{Re}(B) = 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \).

Now, the total real part of the expression is \( \text{Re}(A) + \text{Re}(B) \):

\( (300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) \)

Combine like terms:

\( (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta \)

Which is:

\( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

So, the expression we're trying to maximize is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

Hmm. This looks like a linear combination of sine and cosine, which can be expressed as a single sinusoidal function. The maximum value of \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) is \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \), right?

Wait, more precisely, \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta = R\cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( \phi = \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \) or something like that.

So, in this case, the expression is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). Let me factor out the negative sign to write it as \( 324\cos\theta + (-432)\sin\theta \).

So, the amplitude \( R \) is \( \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Wait, let me compute that.

First, compute \( 324^2 \):

I know that 324 is 18^2, which is 324. So, 324 squared: 324 * 324. Let me compute that.

I can think of it as (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: 432 is 400 + 32. So, (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 + 25,600 is 185,600, plus 1,024 is 186,624.

Wait, but since one term is negative,
