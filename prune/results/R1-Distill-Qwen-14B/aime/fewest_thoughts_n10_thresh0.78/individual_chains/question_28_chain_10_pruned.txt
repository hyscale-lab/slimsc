Okay, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance should be expressed in a particular form, and then I have to sum the numerator, the square root number, and the denominator.

First, the given edge lengths are AB = CD = √41, AC = BD = √80, and BC = AD = √89. Hmm, this seems symmetrical. Maybe the tetrahedron has some kind of symmetry that I can exploit.

I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the distance from the incenter to each face) is related to the volume and the surface area. The formula is similar to the 2D case: the inradius r equals 3 times the volume V divided by the total surface area S. So, r = 3V/S.

So, I need to find the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S.

But how do I compute the volume? Since I have all the edge lengths, maybe I can use coordinates. Placing the tetrahedron in 3D space might help. I can assign coordinates to the vertices in such a way that calculations are easier.

Wait, given the edge lengths, perhaps this tetrahedron is isosceles or has equal opposite edges. Let me see: AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD. This suggests that the tetrahedron is "equifacial" or maybe "isohedral," but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it might be a disphenoid, which is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. Yes, that's right, so this is a disphenoid.

Disphenoids have some nice properties. Specifically, all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, is that true here? Let me check.

If all the opposite edges are equal, then each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89. Wait, let me compute the lengths:

AB = √41, AC = √80, BC = √89.

So each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89. Therefore, all faces are congruent. So, the surface area S will be 4 times the area of one such triangle.

First, let me compute the area of one face. Since all faces are congruent, I can compute the area of triangle ABC, and then multiply by 4 for S.

How do I compute the area of triangle ABC with sides a=√41, b=√80, c=√89? I can use Heron's formula.

First, compute the semi-perimeter s:

s = (a + b + c)/2 = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2.

Wait, but Heron's formula might get messy with these square roots. Alternatively, maybe I can find the area using the formula √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], but that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe I can recognize if the triangle is right-angled. Let's check:

Does (√41)^2 + (√80)^2 equal (√89)^2?

Compute 41 + 80 = 121. And (√89)^2 is 89. 121 ≠ 89, so it's not a right triangle. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe (√41)^2 + (√89)^2? 41 + 89 = 130, which is more than 80. So no, not a right triangle.

Hmm, perhaps I can compute the area using coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the points to make calculations easier.

Let me place point A at (0, 0, 0). Then, let me place point B at (x, 0, 0). Point C can be at (a, b, 0), and point D at (c, d, e). But with the given edge lengths, this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can find a more symmetric coordinate system.

Wait, since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, there's a way to assign coordinates such that the points are symmetric. I remember that in a disphenoid, the coordinates can be set as follows: (a, b, c), (-a, -b, c), (-a, b, -c), (a, -b, -c). Maybe that's the case here.

Let me test this. If I set points as:

A: (a, b, c)
B: (-a, -b, c)
C: (-a, b, -c)
D: (a, -b, -c)

Then, let me compute the distances:

AB: distance between A and B.

Coordinates of A: (a, b, c)
Coordinates of B: (-a, -b, c)
Difference: ( -2a, -2b, 0)
Distance: sqrt[ (2a)^2 + (2b)^2 + 0 ] = 2 sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
Given AB = sqrt(41), so 2 sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = sqrt(41)
Thus, sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = sqrt(41)/2
Squaring both sides: a^2 + b^2 = 41/4.

Similarly, compute AC: distance between A and C.

A: (a, b, c)
C: (-a, b, -c)
Difference: (-2a, 0, -2c)
Distance: sqrt[ (2a)^2 + 0 + (2c)^2 ] = 2 sqrt(a^2 + c^2)
Given AC = sqrt(80), so 2 sqrt(a^2 + c^2) = sqrt(80)
Thus, sqrt(a^2 + c^2) = sqrt(80)/2
Squaring: a^2 + c^2 = 80/4 = 20.

Similarly, compute AD: distance between A and D.

A: (a, b, c)
D: (a, -b, -c)
Difference: (0, -2b, -2c)
Distance: sqrt[0 + (2b)^2 + (2c)^2] = 2 sqrt(b^2 + c^2)
Given AD = sqrt(89), so 2 sqrt(b^2 + c^2) = sqrt(89)
Thus, sqrt(b^2 + c^2) = sqrt(89)/2
Squaring: b^2 + c^2 = 89/4.

Now, let's write down the equations we have:

1. a^2 + b^2 = 41/4
2. a^2 + c^2 = 20
3. b^2 + c^2 = 89/4

We can solve these equations for a^2, b^2, c^2.

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(a^2 + c^2) - (a^2 + b^2) = 20 - 41/4
c^2 - b^2 = 20 - 10.25 = 9.75 = 39/4

But from equation 3, b^2 + c^2 = 89/4.

Let me denote equation 4: c^2 - b^2 = 39/4
Equation 3: c^2 + b^2 = 89/4

Adding equations 3 and 4:

2c^2 = (89 +39)/4 = 128/4 = 32
Thus, c^2 = 16, so c = 4.

Subtracting equation 4 from equation 3:

2b^2 = (89 -39)/4 = 50/4 = 25/2
Thus, b^2 = 25/4, so b = 5/2.

From equation 1: a^2 + b^2 = 41/4
So, a^2 + (25/4) = 41/4
Thus, a^2 = (41 -25)/4 = 16/4 =4, so a = 2.

So, we have a=2, b=5/2, c=4.

So now, the coordinates are:

A: (2, 5/2, 4)
B: (-2, -5/2, 4)
C: (-2, 5/2, -4)
D: (2, -5/2, -4)

Great, now that I have coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron.

The volume of a tetrahedron can be calculated using the scalar triple product formula:

V = | (AB · (AC × AD)) | / 6

But wait, since I have coordinates, I can compute vectors AB, AC, AD, and then compute the scalar triple product.

Let me find vectors from point A:

Vector AB = B - A = (-2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, 4 -4) = (-4, -5, 0)
Vector AC = C - A = (-2 -2, 5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (-4, 0, -8)
Vector AD = D - A = (2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8)

Now, compute the cross product AC × AD first.

AC × AD = |i   j   k|
             -4   0   -8
              0   -5   -8

= i*(0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) - j*(-4*(-8) - 0*(-8)) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)

Compute each component:

i: (0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) = 0 - 40 = -40
j: - [ (-4)*(-8) - 0*(-8) ) ] = - [32 - 0] = -32
k: [ (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 ] = 20 -0 =20

So, AC × AD = (-40, -32, 20)

Now, compute AB · (AC × AD):

AB is (-4, -5, 0)
Dot product with (-40, -32, 20):

= (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20
= 160 + 160 + 0 = 320

So, the absolute value is 320, so Volume V = |320| /6 = 320/6 = 160/3

So the volume V is 160/3.

Now, compute the surface area S. Since all faces are congruent triangles, I can compute the area of one face and multiply by 4.

Let me compute the area of triangle ABC. The sides are AB=√41, AC=√80, BC=√89.

Wait, earlier I tried to compute the area but thought Heron's formula would be messy. Maybe an alternative approach is better.

Alternatively, since I have coordinates for A, B, and C, I can compute the vectors AB and AC and then find the area as half the magnitude of their cross product.

Wait, yes, that's a good idea.

Vectors AB and AC are:

AB = (-4, -5, 0)
AC = (-4, 0, -8)

Compute AB × AC:

|i   j   k|
-4   -5   0
-4   0   -8

= i*( (-5)*(-8) - 0*0 ) - j*( (-4)*(-8) - 0*(-4) ) + k*( (-4)*0 - (-5)*(-4) )

Compute each component:

i: (40 - 0) = 40
j: - [ (32 - 0) ] = -32
k: (0 - 20) = -20

So, AB × AC = (40, -32, -20)

The magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40^2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 ) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024)

Simplify sqrt(3024):

Factor 3024:

Divide by 16: 3024 /16= 189

189=9*21=9*3*7.

So, 3024=16*9*3*7= (4^2)*(3^2)*21.

Thus sqrt(3024)=4*3*sqrt(21)=12√21.

So, |AB × AC| =12√21.

Thus, the area of triangle ABC is ½ * 12√21 = 6√21.

Therefore, each face has area 6√21, so total surface area S=4*6√21=24√21.

Now, go back to the formula for inradius r = 3V/S.

Compute 3V: 3*(160/3)=160.

So, r=160/(24√21)= (160)/(24√21).

Simplify 160/24: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 20/3.

So, r=20/(3√21).

Rationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by √21:

r= (20√21)/(3*21) = (20√21)/63.

So, the distance is 20√21 / 63.

Expressed as m√n /p, m=20, n=21, p=63.

But wait, are 20 and 63 coprime? Let's check.

20 factors: 2,2,5.

63 factors:7,3,3.

No common factors, so yes, m and p are coprime.

Also, n=21, which is 3*7, no square factors, so it satisfies the conditions.

So, m + n + p = 20 +21 +63= 104.

Wait, 20+21=41, 41+63=104.

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because 104 seems a bit high, but perhaps it's correct.

Wait, let me retrace:

Computed V as 160/3, correct?

Yes, triple product was 320, so volume 320/6 =160/3.

Surface area: each face is 6√21, so 4*6=24√21, correct.

r = 3V/S = (3*(160/3))/(24√21) = 160/(24√21) = 20/(3√21)=20√21/(3*21)=20√21/63.

Yes, that's correct.

So, m=20, n=21, p=63. 20+21=41, 41+63=104.

Hmm, I think that's correct. So, the answer is 104.


To solve the problem, we first recognize that the given tetrahedron is a disphenoid with congruent faces. We assign coordinates to the vertices based on the symmetry of the disphenoid:

- \( A: (2, \frac{5}{2}, 4) \)
- \( B: (-2, -\frac{5}{2}, 4) \)
- \( C: (-2, \frac{5}{2}, -4) \)
- \( D: (2, -\frac{5}{2}, -4) \)

Using these coordinates, we calculate the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron using the scalar triple product. The vectors from point \( A \) are:

- \( \overrightarrow{AB} = (-4, -5, 0) \)
- \( \overrightarrow{AC} = (-4, 0, -8) \)
- \( \overrightarrow{AD} = (0, -5, -8) \)

The cross product \( \overrightarrow{AC} \times \overrightarrow{AD} \) is computed as \( (-40, -32, 20) \). The dot product of \( \overrightarrow{AB} \) with this result gives 320, so the volume is \( \frac{320}{6} = \frac{160}{3} \).

Next, we calculate the total surface area \( S \). Each face is a triangle with area \( 6\sqrt{21} \), so the total surface area is \( 4 \times 6\sqrt{21} = 24\sqrt{21} \).

The inradius \( r \) is given by \( r = \frac{3V}{S} \). Substituting the values, we get:

\[
r = \frac{3 \times \frac{160}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{160}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20}{3\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}
\]

Thus, the distance is \( \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63} \), where \( m = 20 \), \( n = 21 \), and \( p = 63 \). Summing these gives \( 20 + 21 + 63 = 104 \).

\boxed{104}
