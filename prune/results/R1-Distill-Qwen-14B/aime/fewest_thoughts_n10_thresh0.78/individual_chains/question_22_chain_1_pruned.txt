Alright, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The hexagon is labeled ABCDEF. The problem also mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, and this triangle has side lengths of 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this. A convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. So, each pair of opposite sides is not only parallel but also equal in length because it's equilateral. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. And all sides are equal in length, say, each side has length 's'.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me think about that. So, if I extend AB, CD, and EF, they meet to form a triangle. Since these are sides of the hexagon, which is convex, the extensions must meet in a specific way to form a triangle outside the hexagon. The sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. So, I need to relate the side length 's' of the hexagon to these triangle sides.

I remember that in such cases, similar triangles might come into play because the hexagon has parallel sides. Maybe the triangle formed by the extensions is similar to some smaller triangles inside the hexagon. Or perhaps the hexagon can be thought of as being "expanded" from the triangle, with each side of the hexagon contributing to the sides of the triangle.

Wait, another thought: in a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, it might resemble a larger figure that's similar to the triangle but scaled down. Maybe the hexagon is like a truncated version of the triangle, where the sides are cut off, but the opposite sides are parallel.

I think I should draw a diagram to help me visualize this. Even though I can't actually draw it, I can imagine or sketch a rough outline. Let me consider a triangle and then cutting off smaller triangles from each corner to form a hexagon. If the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, then each of these cut-off triangles would be similar to the original triangle.

Wait, that might be the key. If I have a large triangle and I cut off three smaller triangles from its corners, each of these smaller triangles would be similar to the original triangle. The sides of the hexagon would then be the sides of these smaller triangles, and the sides of the original triangle would be related to the sides of the hexagon plus some multiples of the hexagon's sides.

Let me try to formalize this. Suppose the original triangle has sides of length 200, 240, and 300. Let's denote these sides as a = 200, b = 240, c = 300. When I cut off a small triangle from each corner, each of these small triangles is similar to the original triangle. Let the scaling factor for each small triangle be 'k'. So, each side of the small triangle would be k*a, k*b, and k*c. But since the hexagon is equilateral, all sides
