Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the product of two real numbers, x and y, both greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle. Let me start with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. 

Wait, log base x of y^x equals 10. I know that log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. So, applying that here, it would mean that x^10 = y^x. That seems right. So equation one is x^10 = y^x.

Now, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the same logic, that would mean y^10 = x^{4y}. So equation two is y^10 = x^{4y}.

Alright, so now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, I need to find x and y such that both these equations are satisfied. Since both x and y are greater than 1, they are positive, which is good because logarithms are defined for positive numbers.

Let me try to express one variable in terms of the other. From the first equation, x^10 = y^x. Maybe I can take the xth root of both sides to get y. So y = x^{10/x}. That seems manageable.

Similarly, from the second equation, y^10 = x^{4y}. If I take the 10th root of both sides, I get y = x^{(4y)/10} which simplifies to y = x^{(2y)/5}.

Wait, so now I have two expressions for y in terms of x:

1. y = x^{10/x}
2. y = x^{(2y)/5}

Since both are equal to y, I can set them equal to each other.

So, x^{10/x} = x^{(2y)/5}

Since the bases are the same and x > 1, the exponents must be equal. So, 10/x = (2y)/5.

Let me write that down: 10/x = (2y)/5.

Simplify this equation. Multiply both sides by x to get 10 = (2y x)/5.

Then, multiply both sides by 5: 50 = 2y x.

Divide both sides by 2: 25 = y x.

Wait, but that's already the product we're trying to find, xy. So xy = 25?

But wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. Let me go back.

From equation one: log_x(y^x) = 10 => x^10 = y^x => y = x^{10/x}.

From equation two: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 => y^10 = x^{4y} => y = x^{(4y)/10} = x^{(2y)/5}.

So, set x^{10/x} = x^{2y/5}.

Since x is greater than 1, we can equate the exponents: 10/x = 2y/5.

Multiply both sides by x: 10 = (2y/5) x.

Which gives 10 = (2xy)/5. Multiply both sides by 5: 50 = 2xy. Divide by 2: 25 = xy.

So, yeah, that seems consistent. So, I think xy is 25.

But wait, let me check if this makes sense with the original equations. Let's suppose xy = 25. So, if I have x and y such that xy =25, then y=25/x.

Let me substitute y=25/x into the first equation: x^10 = y^x = (25/x)^x.

So, x^10 = (25/x)^x. Let me take the natural log of both sides to make it easier. ln(x^10) = ln((25/x)^
