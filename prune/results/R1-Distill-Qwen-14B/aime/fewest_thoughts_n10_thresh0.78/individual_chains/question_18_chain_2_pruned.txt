Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. I'm a bit rusty on my combinatorics, but I'll try to break this down step by step.

First, let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles are equal too. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, right? Because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, where n=12, so (10*180)/12=150 degrees.

Now, the problem is about rectangles. A rectangle has four sides, with opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. But in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can form various angles, so I need to figure out which of these can form the sides of a rectangle.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with a high number of sides, you can form rectangles by choosing pairs of parallel sides or diagonals. So, the key here might be to find pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) that can serve as opposite sides of a rectangle.

In a regular dodecagon, how do the sides and diagonals relate in terms of parallelism? I think that for each side, there are sides and diagonals that are parallel to it. Let me think about the structure.

In a regular polygon, two sides are parallel if the number of sides between them is the same. For example, in a hexagon, each pair of opposite sides is parallel. So, in a dodecagon, sides that are six apart should be parallel. Wait, because 12 is the total number, so if you go six steps around, you end up on the opposite side.

Similarly, diagonals can be parallel. So, for each diagonal, there should be others that are parallel. But how exactly?

Maybe I should consider the dodecagon inscribed in a circle. Then, each vertex can be represented as a point on the circumference, with equal angles between them. The central angle between adjacent vertices is 360/12=30 degrees. So, each vertex is 30 degrees apart.

If I number the vertices from 0 to 11, going clockwise, then the vector from vertex 0 to vertex k is a side or a diagonal, depending on the value of k. The length of these vectors depends on the angle between them, which is 30 degrees times k.

Now, for two vectors (sides or diagonals) to be parallel, the angle between them should be a multiple of 180 degrees, right? Because vectors are parallel if they point in the same or exactly opposite directions.

Wait, no. Wait, in terms of their direction on the polygon. So, if two sides or diagonals are parallel, their vectors should have the same slope, meaning they are either in the same direction or exactly opposite. So, the angle between them should be 0 or 180 degrees.

But in a regular dodecagon, the central angles between vertices are multiples of 30 degrees. So, to get a parallel vector, the difference in their central angles should be 180 degrees, which is 6 steps because each step is 30 degrees. So, vertex 0 to vertex k is parallel to vertex 0 to vertex (k+6), right?

Wait, no. Let me think again. If you have a side from vertex 0 to vertex 1, then the side from vertex 6 to vertex 7 would be directly opposite, hence parallel. Similarly, a diagonal from vertex 0 to vertex 2 would be parallel to the diagonal from vertex 6
