Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis in its plane. The problem says the circle has radius 3, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the distance from the center of the original circle to the axis of revolution is 6.

Then there's a sphere S with radius 11. The torus T can rest on the inside or the outside of this sphere. When it's on the inside, it's internally tangent, and when it's on the outside, it's externally tangent. In both cases, the tangency is along a circle, and we're supposed to find the radii of these circles, r_i and r_o, and then compute the difference r_i - r_o.

Hmm, okay. I think I need to figure out the positions where the torus just touches the sphere. Since the sphere has a radius of 11, its surface is 11 units from its center. The torus, on the other hand, has a certain radius, but it's a bit more complicated because it's a surface of revolution.

Wait, no. The torus is a surface, so maybe I need to think about the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus, and then relate that to the radii where they touch.

Let me recall that a torus can be described in terms of two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle. In this case, R is 6 and r is 3.

So, the torus is parameterized by these two radii. Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle.

I think the key is to find the points where the torus and the sphere are tangent. For tangency, the distance between their centers must satisfy certain conditions.

Wait, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center is outside the torus. The sphere has radius 11, and the torus is inside it. So, the point of tangency would be where the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface is equal to 11.

Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, the sphere is inside the torus, and the point of tangency is where the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's inner surface is equal to 11.

Hmm, but how do I calculate the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surfaces?

Wait, perhaps I should consider the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus. Let me denote the center of the sphere as point O, and the center of the generating circle of the
