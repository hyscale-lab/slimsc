Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared. Then, I have to find the smallest m where m^4 +1 is divisible by p squared. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me break it down.

First, I think I need to find primes p where n^4 ≡ -1 mod p^2 for some n. Since we're working modulo p squared, maybe I can start by considering modulo p first. If n^4 ≡ -1 mod p, then maybe that's a necessary condition before considering higher powers.

So, for a prime p, let's see when -1 is a fourth power modulo p. That would mean there exists some x where x^4 ≡ -1 mod p. Alternatively, x^8 ≡ 1 mod p. The multiplicative order of x modulo p would then divide 8. But since x^4 ≡ -1 mod p, the order can't be 4 because (-1)^2 = 1, so the order is 8. Therefore, 8 must divide p-1 because the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic with order p-1. So, p ≡ 1 mod 8.

Wait, but is that the only possibility? Because for primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8, there exists an element of order 8. So, that would mean that -1 is a fourth power in such fields. So, primes p where p ≡ 1 mod 8 will have solutions to x^4 ≡ -1 mod p.

But the question is about p squared. So, we need n^4 ≡ -1 mod p squared. So, for primes p ≡ 1 mod 8, perhaps such an n exists.

But the problem is asking for the smallest such prime p. So, the smallest primes ≡1 mod 8 are 17, 97, etc. Wait, no. Wait, let's list primes ≡1 mod 8. The primes after 2 are 3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,... So, 17 is the first prime that is 1 mod 8. Let me confirm: 17 divided by 8 gives a remainder of 1. Yes.

But wait, maybe 2 is a prime, but 2 is 2 mod 8. Let me think about n^4 +1 modulo 4. Let's see: For n even, n=2k, n^4=16k^4, which is 0 mod 4. 0 +1=1 mod 4. So, n^4 +1 is 1 mod 4. For n odd, n=2k+1, n^4= (2k+1)^4. Let's see, (2k+1)^4 = 16k^4 + 32k^3 + 24k^2 + 8k +1. So, mod 4, that's 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 +1 =1 mod4. So, n^4 +1 is 2 mod4, which is 2 mod4. So, for n odd, n^4 +1 is 2 mod4, which is not divisible by 4. So, 2 is a prime, and for n even, n^4+1 is 1 mod4, so not divisible by 4. So, p=2 is out of the question because n^4+1 can't be divisible by 4.

So, the next prime is p=17. Wait, is 17 the least? Let's see. Let me check primes less than 17: 3,5,7,11,
