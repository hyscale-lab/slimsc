Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. The torus T is created by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in its plane, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, it's like a donut shape. The sphere S has a radius of 11. 

The problem says that when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When T rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how a torus and a sphere can be tangent to each other. I remember that when two surfaces are tangent, they touch at a single point or along a curve. In this case, they're tangent along a circle, so that must be the case when the torus is either inside or outside the sphere.

First, I should probably figure out the properties of the torus. The torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the generating circle) is 3.

Now, the sphere has a radius of 11. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent to it at some circle, and when it's outside, it's tangent in another way. I need to find the radii of these circles of tangency, r_i and r_o, and then compute their difference.

I think I should model the torus mathematically. The standard equation for a torus in 3D space, centered at the origin, with the axis along the z-axis, is:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r²

Where R is the major radius (distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus), and r is the minor radius (radius of the tube). So in this case, R = 6 and r = 3.

So the equation of the torus is:

(√(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 9

The sphere S has a radius of 11. Let's assume it's also centered at the origin for simplicity. So its equation is:

x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121

Now, when the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, the sphere and torus are tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's resting on the outside, they are tangent along another circle.

I need to find the radii of these circles.

I think the key here is to find the points where the torus and the sphere touch each other. Since they are tangent along a circle, the equations of the torus and sphere must have a common solution set that lies on a circle, and their normals (derivatives) must be equal at those points.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus, but wait, both are centered at the origin in this case. Wait, no, the torus is centered at the origin, and the sphere is also centered at the origin. So maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the centers of the circles of tangency. Since both the sphere and torus are symmetric about the z-axis, the circles of tangency should lie in planes perpendicular to the z-axis, so their centers will lie along the z-axis.

Let me try to visualize this. When the torus is inside the
