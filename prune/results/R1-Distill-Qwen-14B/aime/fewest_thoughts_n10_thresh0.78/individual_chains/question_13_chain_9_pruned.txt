Okay, so I need to solve this math problem about Aya's walking speed and the time she takes. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, the entire walk takes her 4 hours, including 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she increases her speed to 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, still including the same 't' minutes in the coffee shop. Now, we need to find out how many minutes the walk takes her when she walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, including the 't' minutes again.

Hmm, I think the key here is to set up equations based on the information given. Let me break it down.

First, when Aya walks at speed 's' km/h, the total time is 4 hours. But this includes the walking time plus the coffee shop time 't'. Similarly, when she walks at 's + 2' km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, again including 't' minutes.

Wait, but I should probably convert all the times into the same unit, either hours or minutes, to make it easier. Let me convert everything into hours because speed is given in km per hour.

So, 4 hours is straightforward. 2 hours and 24 minutes: since 24 minutes is 24/60 hours, which is 0.4 hours. So 2.4 hours total.

Wait, no, 24 minutes is 0.4 hours? Let me check: 24 divided by 60 is 0.4, yes. So 2 hours 24 minutes is 2.4 hours.

Similarly, the coffee shop time 't' is in minutes, so I might need to convert that into hours as well when setting up the equations.

Wait, but maybe it's better to work in minutes throughout. Let's see.

So, total time when walking at speed 's' is 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. This includes walking time and 't' minutes in the coffee shop.

Similarly, when she walks at 's + 2' km/h, the total time is 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 2*60 +24 = 144 minutes. Again, this includes walking time and 't' minutes.

So, the walking time without the coffee stop would be total time minus 't' minutes.

Let me define variables:

Letâ€™s denote:

- Distance: 9 km (constant)
- Speed: s km/h in the first case, (s + 2) km/h in the second case, and (s + 0.5) km/h in the third case (since 1/2 is 0.5).

Wait, the third speed is s + (1/2) km/h, right?

So, the time taken to walk 9 km at speed 's' km/h is (9 / s) hours. But the total time, including 't' minutes, is 4 hours. So, the equation would be:

(9 / s) + (t / 60) = 4

Similarly, when she walks at speed 's + 2' km/h, the walking time is (9 / (s + 2)) hours. The total time is 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, so:

(9 / (s + 2)) + (t / 60) = 2.4

Wait, but I can write both equations with 't' in minutes. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe it's
