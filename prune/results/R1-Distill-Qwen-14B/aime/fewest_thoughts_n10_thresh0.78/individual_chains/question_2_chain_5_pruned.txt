Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what's given and what's being asked.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, these are points in the first quadrant since all coordinates are positive. I can imagine point O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere along the y-axis, a bit less than (0,1) because sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each segment PQ is 1 unit long, starts at some point P on the x-axis, and ends at some point Q on the y-axis. Since they're in the first quadrant, both P and Q have positive coordinates.

Now, the problem mentions a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that doesn't belong to any other segment from F except AB. So AB is one of these segments PQ in F, I think. The question is about finding OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, we need to express this as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

First, let me visualize this. AB is a segment from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So AB has length sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So AB is indeed a segment of unit length, so it's part of the family F.

So F is all possible segments from x-axis to y-axis, length 1, in the first quadrant. Each such segment can be represented as PQ where P is (p,0) and Q is (0,q), with p > 0, q > 0, and sqrt(p² + q²) = 1.

So, for each p and q such that p² + q² = 1, we have a segment PQ.

Now, AB is one such segment. Let me confirm: when P is (1/2, 0) and Q is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the length is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt(1) = 1. So yes, AB is in F.

The problem says that C is a point on AB, other than A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, C is unique in this property. So, we need to find such a point C on AB, compute OC², and then find p + q where OC² = p/q.

I think the key idea here is to parameterize AB, find the parametric equations for AB, then for each point C on AB, find whether it lies on any other segment PQ from F, and determine the point where it doesn't lie on any other PQ except AB.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the envelope of all such segments PQ. The envelope is the curve that is tangent to each member of a family of curves. In this case, perhaps the envelope of the family F is a curve, and AB is a member of F, and point C is where AB is tangent to this envelope. So, C is the point where AB touches the envelope, and thus doesn't lie on any other PQ from F.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the envelope of the family F, and the envelope is a curve, and AB is a chord of this curve. The point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope, so it's the only point on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ in F.

So, let me try to find the envelope of the family F.

First, let's represent the family F parametrically. Each segment PQ has endpoints P(p, 0) and Q(0, q), with p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So, for each p in (0,1), q = sqrt(1 - p²). Or, alternatively, we can parameterize p and q using an angle θ, such that p = cosθ, q = sinθ, since p² + q² = 1. So, for θ from 0 to π/2, we get all such segments PQ.

So, each segment PQ can be parameterized as
