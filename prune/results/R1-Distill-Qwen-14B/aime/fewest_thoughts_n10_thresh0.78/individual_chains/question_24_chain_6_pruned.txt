Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of the squares of a list of positive integers. The list has some specific properties, and I need to figure out what the numbers are first. Let me try to unpack each condition step by step.

First, the sum of all items is 30. So whatever numbers I come up with, when I add them all together, they should total 30.

The second condition is that the unique mode of the list is 9. Mode is the number that appears most frequently. And it's unique, meaning no other number appears as many times as 9. So 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list.

Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Hmm, that's interesting. So if I sort the list in order, the middle number (the median) isn't actually in the list. That suggests that the median is a number that's between two of the numbers in the list. For example, if the list has an even number of elements, the median would be the average of the two middle numbers. But since the median is a positive integer not in the list, that average must result in an integer, and that integer isn't present in the list.

So let me think about how to structure this list.

First, let's recall some definitions:

- **Mode**: The number that appears most frequently. Since it's unique, 9 must appear more times than any other number.
- **Median**: The middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. If there's an even number of elements, it's the average of the two middle numbers.

Let me denote the list as having n elements. Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, n can't be 1 because then the median would be the element itself, which would be in the list. So n must be at least 2. Let's think about whether it's even or odd.

If n is odd, the median is the middle number, which must be an integer not present in the list. Wait, but if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is one of the elements. So that can't be because the median is not in the list. So n must be even. Because for even n, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which can be an integer without being present in the list.

So n is even. Let's say n=2k. So the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements.

Since the median is a positive integer, the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements must be an integer. That means the two middle numbers must be either both even or both odd, so their sum is even, making the average an integer.

Also, the median isn't in the list, so the average of these two numbers isn't present anywhere else in the list.

Now, let's plan the structure of the list.

Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. Let's say 9 appears m times, and all other numbers appear less than m times.

I need to design the list such that the sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is an integer not in the list.

Let me start by trying to figure out the minimal possible n.

Wait, but I don't know n yet. Let me think about possible values for n.

But perhaps instead, I can think about how the list is structured.

Since the median is not in the list, let's assume n is even, say n=2k.

To have the median not present, the two middle numbers should be such that their average is not in the list.

Let me start by considering the minimal possible n where 9 can be the mode.

If I have 9 appearing twice, but maybe that's not enough. Let's see.

Wait, suppose n is 8
