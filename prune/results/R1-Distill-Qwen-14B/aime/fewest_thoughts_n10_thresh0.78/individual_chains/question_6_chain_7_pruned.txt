Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, I should understand what the functions f(x) and g(x) are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So both f and g are functions that take the absolute value of x, subtract a fraction, and then take the absolute value again. That means they're both V-shaped graphs, right? Let me visualize f(x) first.

For f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, the inner part |x| is a V-shape with its vertex at (0,0). Then, subtracting 1/2 shifts the graph down by 1/2, so the vertex is now at (0, -1/2). Taking the absolute value of that would flip the parts of the graph that are below the x-axis back up. So f(x) would have vertices at x = 1/2 and x = -1/2, right? Wait, no. Let me think again: when you subtract 1/2 from |x|, the critical points are where |x| - 1/2 = 0, so |x| = 1/2. So x = 1/2 and x = -1/2. Thus, f(x) would be a V-shape with its vertex at (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0), and it opens upwards. Wait, no, that's not right. Because after subtracting 1/2, the vertex is at (0, -1/2), and then taking the absolute value would reflect any negative parts. So, the graph of f(x) would have a V-shape where it's 0 at x = 1/2 and x = -1/2, and peaks at (0,1/2). Wait, actually, let me compute f(x) for some values.

When x=0, |0| = 0, so |0 - 1/2| = 1/2. So f(0) = 1/2.

When x=1/2, |1/2| = 1/2, so |1/2 - 1/2| = 0. So f(1/2) = 0.

When x=1, |1| =1, so |1 - 1/2| = 1/2, so f(1) = 1/2.

Similarly, when x= -1/2, same as x=1/2, f(-1/2)=0.

So f(x) is a V shape that is 0 at x=±1/2, peaks at 1/2 in the middle, and then goes back to 1/2 at x=±1, and continues similarly on both sides. So it's a periodic function with period 1, right? Because it's symmetric around each integer.

Similarly, g(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze that.

At x=0, |0|=0, so |0 - 1/4|=1/4, so g(0)=1/4.

At x=1/4, |1/4|=1/4, so |1/4 - 1/4|=0, so g(1/4)=0.

At x=1/2, |1/2|=1/2, so |1/2 - 1/4|=1/4, so g(1/2)=1/4.

At x=3/4, |3/4|=3/4, |3/4 -1/4|=1/2, so g(3/4)=1/2.

At x=1, |1|=1, |1 -1/4|=3/4, so g(1)=3/4.

So g(x) is a V-shape that is 0 at x=±1/4, peaks at 1/4 in the middle, goes up to 1/2 at x=±3/4, then peaks again at 3/4 in the middle at x=1, etc. So it's periodic with period 1 as well.

Now, the functions in the problem are y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). So both of these are transformations of the composition of f and g applied to sine and cosine functions, respectively, scaled by 4.

Let me
