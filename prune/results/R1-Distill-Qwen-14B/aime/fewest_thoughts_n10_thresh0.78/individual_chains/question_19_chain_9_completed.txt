Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it. It's about a triangle ABC with some given properties. The circumcenter is O, and the incenter is I. They tell me that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC.

Hmm, okay. Let me recall what I know about triangle centers and properties related to them.

First, the circumradius R is 13, so that's the radius of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC. The inradius r is 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle.

They mention that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the incenter I to the circumcenter O. That seems like a specific condition that might relate some of the distances or angles in the triangle.

I need to find AB·AC. That's the product of the lengths of sides AB and AC.

Let me think about the relationships between the inradius, circumradius, and the sides of the triangle. I remember that in a triangle, the inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter. Specifically, r = A/s, where A is the area, and s is the semiperimeter.

The circumradius R is related to the sides and the area by the formula R = (a b c)/(4 A), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.

Hmm, but I don't know all the sides yet. Maybe I can express AB·AC in terms of other variables.

Wait, AB and AC are sides opposite to angles C and B, respectively, in the standard notation. But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Alternatively, let me think about coordinate geometry. Maybe placing the triangle in a coordinate system to make things easier.

Let's consider placing the circumcenter O at the origin (0,0). Then, the inradius I is somewhere else. But IA is perpendicular to OI. So, maybe if I can find the coordinates of I, that would help.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a trigonometric identity or formula that connects IA, OI, and the sides.

Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by OI^2 = R(R - 2r). Is that correct? Wait, let me verify.

Yes, I think that's a standard formula: OI² = R² - 2 R r. So, OI² = R² - 2 R r.

Given that R is 13 and r is 6, OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, that seems small, but okay. So, OI is sqrt(13). Now, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in the triangle formed by points O, I, and A, angle at I is 90 degrees.

So, triangle OIA is right-angled at I. So, by the Pythagorean theorem, OA² = OI² + IA².

But OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, OA² = 13² = 169.

OI is sqrt(13), so OI² = 13. Therefore, IA² + OI² = OA² ⇒ IA² = OA² - OI² = 169 - 13 = 156. So, IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).

Wait, but IA is the length from the inradius center I to vertex A. Is there a formula for IA in terms of other triangle quantities?

Yes, I think the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the angles of the triangle.

Wait, more precisely, in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = r / sin(A/2). Let me check.

Yes, I think that's correct. Because, in the inradius, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side, and in the exradius formulas, but perhaps for the distance from incenter to vertex, it's IA = r / sin(A/2). Let me think.

In the inradius, if I consider the triangle formed by the incenter I and the vertex A, and the point where the incircle touches side BC, say D. Then, ID is r, and ID is perpendicular to BC.

Wait, but IA is the distance from I to A. So, in triangle IDA, right-angled at D, IA is the hypotenuse, and ID is one leg. So, IA² = ID² + DA².

But ID is r, which is 6, and DA is the length from A to the point of tangency D on BC. DA is equal to (AB + AC - BC)/2. Because in a triangle, the length from a vertex to the point where the incircle touches the opposite side is equal to (sum of the two adjacent sides minus the opposite side) divided by 2.

So, DA = (AB + AC - BC)/2.

Thus, IA² = r² + [(AB + AC - BC)/2]^2.

But from earlier, IA² is 156. So, 156 = 6² + [(AB + AC - BC)/2]^2 ⇒ 156 = 36 + [(AB + AC - BC)/2]^2 ⇒ [(AB + AC - BC)/2]^2 = 120 ⇒ (AB + AC - BC)/2 = sqrt(120) ⇒ (AB + AC - BC) = 2*sqrt(120).

Hmm, that's something, but I don't know if I can use that directly. Let me note that.

Another thought: Since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe there's a relationship in terms of vectors or coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use trigonometric identities involving angles. Let me think about the Euler formula: OI² = R² - 2Rr. Which we already used.

Wait, let me recall another formula: In any triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can also be expressed in terms of the triangle's angles and sides.

I think IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)). Let me verify this. So, if angle at A is α, then maybe IA = r / sin(α/2). Let me see.

Yes, I think that's correct. Because in the inradius, the inradius r is related to the angle bisector. So, in the triangle formed by I, A, and the point where the incircle touches BC, which is D, as I mentioned earlier.

In triangle IDA, which is right-angled at D, IA is the hypotenuse. So, IA = ID / sin(angle at I). But angle at I is angle AID, which is equal to 90 degrees minus angle DAI.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of trigonometric functions.

Wait, from the inradius to the vertex, I think the formula is IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Let me check with an example. If the triangle is equilateral, in which case all centers coincide, so that would be a case where IA is zero, but wait, in an equilateral triangle, inradius is at the centroid, which is also the circumradius center. So, maybe the formula still holds.

Wait, maybe I should derive it.

Let me consider triangle AID, where D is the point where the incircle touches BC. Triangle AID is right-angled at D. So, ID = r, DA = (AB + AC - BC)/2, as before.

Then, in triangle AID, sin(angle at A) = ID / IA ⇒ sin(angle at A) = r / IA ⇒ IA = r / sin(angle at A). Wait, no, angle at A in triangle AID is angle DAI, which is equal to angle BAI. But angle BAI is half of angle BAC, since I is the incenter. So, angle DAI = angle BAC / 2. So, angle at A in triangle AID is angle BAC / 2.

Therefore, sin(angle BAC / 2) = r / IA ⇒ IA = r / sin(angle BAC / 2). So, yes, IA = r / sin(A/2).

So, IA = 6 / sin(A/2). And earlier, we found that IA² = 156 ⇒ IA = sqrt(156). So:

6 / sin(A/2) = sqrt(156) ⇒ sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(156) ⇒ sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) ) ⇒ sin(A/2) = 3 / sqrt(39) ⇒ sin(A/2) = 3 / (sqrt(13)*sqrt(3)) ) ⇒ sin(A/2) = sqrt(13)/ (sqrt(13)*sqrt(3)) * 3? Wait, maybe I should rationalize.

Wait, 6 / sqrt(156) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) ) = 3 / sqrt(39). So, sin(A/2) = 3 / sqrt(39). Rationalizing the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(39):

sin(A/2) = 3 sqrt(39) / 39 = sqrt(39)/13.

Wait, because 3 sqrt(39) is sqrt(9)*sqrt(39) = sqrt(351), but that's not helpful. Wait, 3/sqrt(39) is equal to sqrt(39)/13? Let me compute 3/sqrt(39):

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(39): 3 sqrt(39) / 39 = sqrt(39)/13. Yes, that's correct. So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. Then, we can compute cos(A/2) using the identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1.

So, cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt( (169 - 39)/169 ) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.

So, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

Now, in a triangle, the product AB·AC can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Let me think.

Wait, AB = c, AC = b, in the standard notation where side a is opposite angle A, side b is opposite angle B, and side c is opposite angle C. So, AB is side c, AC is side b.

Wait, but the product AB·AC is b·c.

Alternatively, using the Law of Sines, which says that a / sin A = 2R. So, a = 2R sin A. Similarly, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.

So, b·c = (2R sin B)(2R sin C) = 4 R² sin B sin C.

Hmm, but I need to relate this to something else. Alternatively, maybe express sin B and sin C in terms of angle A.

Wait, in any triangle, A + B + C = π, so B + C = π - A. So, perhaps using product-to-sum formulas.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find another way. Let me think about the formula for the area of the triangle.

The area A is equal to r*s, where s is the semiperimeter. Also, A = (a b c)/(4R). So, perhaps I can relate these.

But I don't know the semiperimeter or the sides yet. Alternatively, maybe I can find another relation.

Wait, perhaps I can express AB·AC in terms of angle A and the sides. Since AB = c = 2R sin C, AC = b = 2R sin B. So, AB·AC = 4 R² sin B sin C.

But since B + C = π - A, maybe I can express sin B sin C in terms of angle A.

Using the identity sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)] / 2. Since B + C = π - A, this becomes [cos(B - C) - cos(π - A)] / 2. And cos(π - A) = -cos A.

So, sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) + cos A]/2.

Hmm, but that introduces cos(B - C), which I don't know. Alternatively, perhaps I can find another approach.

Wait, maybe using the formula for the area in terms of the inradius: A = r*s, where s = (a + b + c)/2.

And also, A = (a b c)/(4 R).

So, I can set r*s = (a b c)/(4 R). Let me write that:

6 * s = (a b c) / (4 * 13) ⇒ 6 * s = (a b c) / 52 ⇒ a b c = 312 s.

But I don't know a, b, c, or s. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can express s in terms of the sides. s = (a + b + c)/2.

But without more information, this might not be helpful directly.

Wait, but I know angle A, or rather, I can find angle A because I know sin(A/2) and cos(A/2).

From earlier, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, and cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

So, angle A/2 is arcsin(sqrt(39)/13). So, angle A is 2 times that. Let me compute sin A and cos A.

Using double-angle formulas:

sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = 2*sqrt(39*130)/(13^2).

Let me compute 39*130. 39*100=3900, 39*30=1170, so total 5070.

So, sqrt(5070). Hmm, 5070 factors: 5070 = 10 * 507 = 10 * 3 * 169 = 10 * 3 * 13². So sqrt(5070) = sqrt(10 * 3 * 13²) = 13 * sqrt(30).

So, sin A = 2*(13 * sqrt(30)) / (13²) ) = (2*13*sqrt(30)) / 169 = 2 sqrt(30)/13.

So, sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13.

Similarly, cos A = 1 - 2 sin²(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 - 78)/169 = 91/169 = 7*13/(13²) ⇒ 7/13.

Wait, let me verify:

cos A = 1 - 2 sin²(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169-78)/169 = 91/169. Simplify 91/169: both divided by 13? 91 ÷13=7, 169 ÷13=13. So, 7/13. So, cos A = 7/13.

Alternatively, using the identity cos A = 1 - 2 sin²(A/2) = 2 cos²(A/2) - 1. Let's verify that:

2 cos²(A/2) - 1 = 2*(130/169) - 1 = 260/169 - 1 = (260 - 169)/169 = 91/169 = 7/13. Yes, same result.

So, sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13, cos A = 7/13.

Now, in the Law of Cosines, for angle A:

a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A.

But I don't know a, b, c. Hmm.

Wait, but I need to find bc, since AB·AC = c·b.

So, if I can find bc, that would be the answer.

Let me think about other relations.

We have the area in terms of r and s: A = r*s = 6s.

We also have the area in terms of sides and sine of angle A: A = (1/2) bc sin A.

So, setting them equal: 6s = (1/2) bc sin A ⇒ 12s = bc sin A.

We know sin A is 2 sqrt(30)/13, so:

12s = bc*(2 sqrt(30)/13) ⇒ bc = (12s * 13)/(2 sqrt(30)) ) ⇒ bc = (6s *13)/sqrt(30) ) ⇒ bc = (78 s)/sqrt(30).

Hmm, but I don't know s yet. So, need another equation.

Wait, perhaps using the relation from the Law of Sines.

We have a = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13) ) = 2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 4 sqrt(30).

Wait, because 2R sin A is a. So, a = 4 sqrt(30).

So, side a, which is BC, is 4 sqrt(30).

Hmm, that's good. Now, a = 4 sqrt(30).

Now, semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2. So, s = (4√30 + b + c)/2.

But I don't know b + c yet.

Wait, let me think about another formula. The distance from the inradius to the vertex A is IA = sqrt(156). So, IA² = 156. We had an expression for IA² in terms of r and DA.

Wait, earlier, IA² = r² + [(b + c - a)/2]^2.

We had:

IA² = 156 = 6² + [(b + c - a)/2]^2 ⇒ 156 = 36 + [(b + c - a)/2]^2 ⇒ [(b + c - a)/2]^2 = 120 ⇒ (b + c - a)/2 = sqrt(120) ⇒ b + c - a = 2 sqrt(120).

But a is 4 sqrt(30), so:

b + c - 4 sqrt(30) = 2 sqrt(120).

Compute sqrt(120): sqrt(4*30) = 2 sqrt(30). So, 2 sqrt(120) = 2*(2 sqrt(30)) ) = 4 sqrt(30).

So, b + c - 4 sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30) ⇒ b + c = 8 sqrt(30).

So, now I know that b + c = 8 sqrt(30).

And a = 4 sqrt(30).

So, now, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4√30 + 8√30)/2 = (12√30)/2 = 6√30.

So, s = 6 sqrt(30).

Great, now s is known.

Earlier, I had bc = (78 s)/sqrt(30).

So, bc = (78 * 6 sqrt(30))/sqrt(30) ) = 78 *6 = 468.

Because sqrt(30) cancels out.

Wait, let me compute it step by step:

78 * 6 = 468.

So, bc = 468.

Therefore, AB·AC = bc = 468.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

We started with triangle ABC, with circumradius R=13, inradius r=6, IA perpendicular to OI. Then, using Euler's formula, OI² = R² - 2Rr = 169 - 156 = 13, so OI = sqrt(13). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle OIA is right-angled, so OA² = OI² + IA² ⇒ 13² = 13 + IA² ⇒ IA² = 156 ⇒ IA = 2 sqrt(39).

Then, using the formula IA = r / sin(A/2), we found sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

From there, we found sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13 and cos A = 7/13.

Then, using the Law of Sines, a = 2R sin A = 4 sqrt(30).

Then, using the formula IA² = r² + [(b + c - a)/2]^2, we found that b + c = 8 sqrt(30).

Then, s = (a + b + c)/2 = 6 sqrt(30).

Then, using the area formula A = r s = 6 * 6 sqrt(30) = 36 sqrt(30).

Also, A = (1/2) bc sin A ⇒ 36 sqrt(30) = (1/2) bc*(2 sqrt(30)/13).

Simplifying, 36 sqrt(30) = (bc sqrt(30))/13 ⇒ bc = (36 sqrt(30) *13)/sqrt(30) ) = 36 *13 = 468.

Yes, that makes sense. Therefore, AB·AC = 468.

I think that's the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the circumradius \( R = 13 \) and the inradius \( r = 6 \). The distance between the circumcenter \( O \) and the incenter \( I \) is given by Euler's formula:
\[
OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr = 13^2 - 2 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 = 169 - 156 = 13
\]
Thus, \( OI = \sqrt{13} \).

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( OIA \) is right-angled at \( I \). Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \implies 13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \implies IA^2 = 169 - 13 = 156 \implies IA = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

The distance from the incenter to vertex \( A \) is given by \( IA = \frac{r}{\sin(A/2)} \). Substituting \( IA = 2\sqrt{39} \) and \( r = 6 \):
\[
2\sqrt{39} = \frac{6}{\sin(A/2)} \implies \sin(A/2) = \frac{6}{2\sqrt{39}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{39}} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}
\]

Using the identity \( \cos(A/2) = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2(A/2)} \):
\[
\cos(A/2) = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{130}{169}} = \frac{\sqrt{130}}{13}
\]

Next, we find \( \sin A \) and \( \cos A \) using double-angle identities:
\[
\sin A = 2 \sin(A/2) \cos(A/2) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{130}}{13} = \frac{2\sqrt{5070}}{169} = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13}
\]
\[
\cos A = 1 - 2\sin^2(A/2) = 1 - 2 \cdot \frac{39}{169} = \frac{91}{169} = \frac{7}{13}
\]

Using the Law of Sines, the side \( a \) opposite angle \( A \) is:
\[
a = 2R \sin A = 2 \cdot 13 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} = 4\sqrt{30}
\]

From the relation \( IA^2 = r^2 + \left(\frac{b + c - a}{2}\right)^2 \):
\[
156 = 36 + \left(\frac{b + c - 4\sqrt{30}}{2}\right)^2 \implies \left(\frac{b + c - 4\sqrt{30}}{2}\right)^2 = 120 \implies b + c = 8\sqrt{30}
\]

The semiperimeter \( s \) is:
\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} = \frac{4\sqrt{30} + 8\sqrt{30}}{2} = 6\sqrt{30}
\]

The area \( A \) of the triangle is:
\[
A = r \cdot s = 6 \cdot 6\sqrt{30} = 36\sqrt{30}
\]

Using the area formula \( A = \frac{1}{2} bc \sin A \):
\[
36\sqrt{30} = \frac{1}{2} bc \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} \implies bc = \frac{36\sqrt{30} \cdot 13}{\sqrt{30}} = 468
\]

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC = bc = 468 \).

\[
\boxed{468}
\]
