Okay, so I have this complex number problem to solve. Let me read it again: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that for any complex number z, if |z| = r, then the reciprocal of z, which is 1/z, is equal to the conjugate of z divided by r squared. So, since |z| is 4, |z| squared is 16. So, 1/z would be (conjugate of z)/16. That might come in handy later.

Let me denote z as 4e^{iθ}, because |z| is 4. So, z can be written in polar form as 4 times e to the iθ, where θ is the argument of z. That makes sense. So, if I write z = 4e^{iθ}, then its conjugate would be 4e^{-iθ}, and 1/z would be (4e^{-iθ}) / 16 = e^{-iθ}/4.

Wait, let me check that: 1/z = 1/(4e^{iθ}) = (1/4)e^{-iθ}, yes that's correct. So, 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

So, substituting z and 1/z into the expression:

(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z becomes:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}.

Let me compute 4*(75 + 117i) first:

4*75 = 300, 4*117i = 468i. So, the first term is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 + 144i) * (1/4) e^{-iθ}.

(96 + 144i)/4 is 24 + 36i. So, the second term is (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So now, the entire expression is:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Now, I need to compute the real part of this expression. Let me compute each part step by step.

First, let me expand e^{iθ} and e^{-iθ} using Euler's formula:

e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ,

e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, the expression becomes:

(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) + (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Let me compute each multiplication separately.

First, compute (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ):

Multiply the terms:

300*cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:

300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Now, combine like terms:

Real parts: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ,

Imaginary parts: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ.

So, the first term's real part is 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ,

and the imaginary part is 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ.

Similarly, let's compute the second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Multiply the terms:

24 cosθ -24i sinθ +36i cosθ -36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 = -1, so:

24 cosθ -24i sinθ +36i cosθ +36 sinθ.

Combine like terms:

Real parts: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ,

Imaginary parts: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i.

So, the second term's real part is 24 cosθ +36 sinθ,

and the imaginary part is (-24 sinθ +36 cosθ).

Now, the entire expression's real part is the sum of the real parts of both terms:

Real part = [300 cosθ - 468 sinθ] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ]

Let me combine these:

300 cosθ +24 cosθ = 324 cosθ,

-468 sinθ +36 sinθ = -432 sinθ.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Similarly, the imaginary part is:

[300 sinθ +468 cosθ] + [-24 sinθ +36 cosθ] = (300 sinθ -24 sinθ) + (468 cosθ +36 cosθ) = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

But wait, we are only concerned with the real part, so I can focus on 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

So, our goal is to maximize the expression 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Hmm, I remember that expressions of the form a cosθ + b sinθ can be written as R cos(θ + φ), where R is sqrt(a^2 + b^2), and φ is some angle. Alternatively, we can think of it as the dot product of two vectors.

Wait, but in this case, the expression is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. So, it's a cosθ + b sinθ with a=324, b=-432.

So, the maximum value of this expression is the magnitude, which is sqrt(a^2 + b^2). Because the maximum of a cosθ + b sinθ is sqrt(a^2 +b^2).

Let me compute sqrt(324² + (-432)^2).
