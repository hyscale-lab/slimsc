Okay, so I've got this math problem here about filling a 2x3 grid with digits. The goal is to make sure that when you read the numbers left to right, the two numbers add up to 999, and when you read them top to bottom, the three numbers add up to 99. Hmm, that's a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2-row by 3-column grid. So, each row will form a 3-digit number, and each column will form a 2-digit number. Wait, no, actually, the problem says the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if each column is a digit, then top to bottom would be a 2-digit number for each column. But if there are three columns, that would be three 2-digit numbers, right? So, the sum is 99. Similarly, when reading left to right, each row is a 3-digit number, and the sum of the two 3-digit numbers is 999.

Let me make sure I understand this correctly. The grid has two rows and three columns. So, the first row is a 3-digit number, say ABC, and the second row is DEF. So, ABC + DEF = 999. Additionally, the columns are A D, B E, and C F. So, the three numbers are AD, BE, and CF, and their sum is 99. So, AD + BE + CF = 99.

Wait, that makes sense. So, we're supposed to fill each cell with a digit (0-9), but I'm assuming that leading zeros are allowed because the example given has a zero in the first cell of the first row.

So, the problem is to find the number of ways to assign digits to each cell such that:

1. The two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows add up to 999.
2. The three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns add up to 99.

Let me try to model this mathematically.

Let the grid be:

A B C
D E F

So, ABC is a 3-digit number, which is 100*A + 10*B + C.

Similarly, DEF is a 3-digit number: 100*D + 10*E + F.

The sum ABC + DEF = 999.

So, 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999.

Which can be rewritten as:

100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

Similarly, for the columns:

AD is 10*A + D.

BE is 10*B + E.

CF is 10*C + F.

So, AD + BE + CF = 99.

Which is:

10A + D + 10B +
