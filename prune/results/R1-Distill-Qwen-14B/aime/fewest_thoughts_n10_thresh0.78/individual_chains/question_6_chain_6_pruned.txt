Okay, so I have this math problem here that I need to solve. It's about finding the number of intersections between two graphs: one is y equals 4 times g of f of sin(2πx), and the other is x equals 4 times g of f of cos(3πy). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what functions f and g are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2|. Wait, that's the absolute value of |x| minus 1/2, all inside another absolute value. So, f(x) is effectively | |x| - 1/2 |. Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|, so that's | |x| - 1/4 |. I think I can visualize these functions by considering the behavior of |x| and then shifting and taking absolute value again.

Let me consider f(x) first. The standard absolute value function |x| is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). When we do |x| minus 1/2, that's shifting the graph down by 1/2. So, the vertex would be at (0, -1/2). But since we take the absolute value again, any negative parts would be flipped up. So, the points where |x| - 1/2 is negative would become positive. That happens when |x| < 1/2, right? Because if |x| is less than 1/2, then |x| - 1/2 is negative, and the outer absolute value makes it positive.

So, the graph of f(x) would have two V-shapes. Let me sketch it in my mind. For |x| >= 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which is a V-shape starting at (1/2, 0) and going upwards on both sides. For |x| < 1/2, f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|, which is another V-shape peaking at (0, 1/2) and going down to (1/2, 0). So, the graph of f(x) is a W shape, symmetric about the y-axis, with minima at x = ±1/2, y=0, and a maximum at x=0, y=1/2.

Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. So, similar reasoning applies. The inner absolute value is |x|, then subtract 1/4, then take absolute value again. So, for |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4; for |x| < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|. So, the graph of g(x) is a W shape as well, but with minima at x = ±1/4, y=0, and a maximum at x=0, y=1/4.

Alright, so I have these two functions f and g. Now, the problem involves composing these functions with sin and cos, and then scaling them by 4. So, let me first think about f(sin(2πx)) and g of that.

Let me write down the functions:

y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))

and

x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))

So, these are parametric equations, but they're set equal to y and x respectively. Wait, but in the second equation, x is expressed in terms of y, which is itself a function of x. This seems like a system of equations where both x and y are dependent on each other through these functions.

Wait, but to find the number of intersections, I think we have to find all (x,y) such that y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So, substituting one into the other might be necessary, but given the complexity, it might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I can analyze the behavior of these functions to find how many solutions exist.

Hmm. Let me consider the ranges of f and g first.

Since f(x) is | |x| - 1/2 |, the output of f can be from 0 to 1/2. Similarly, g(x) is | |x| - 1/4 |, so its output ranges from 0 to 1/4.

So, when we compose f with sin(2πx), the input to f is sin(2πx), which ranges between -1 and 1. But f is applied to |x|, so f(sin(2πx)) will be | | sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |. Let's compute the range of this.

The inner |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. Then, subtracting 1/2, so the inner part is between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking the absolute value, the result is between 0 and 1/2.

So, f(sin(2πx)) ranges from 0 to 1/2. Then, g is applied to this. Since g(x) is | |x| - 1/4 |, and the input to g is between 0 and 1/2.

Let me consider the range of g over [0, 1/2]. The input to g is t = f(sin(2πx)) ∈ [0, 1/2].

So, for t in [0, 1/4], g(t) = 1/4 - t. And for t in [1/4, 1/2], g(t) = t - 1/4.

Therefore, the range of g(t) when t is in [0,1/2] is [0, 1/4]. Because at t=0, g(0)=1/4; as t increases to 1/4, g(t) decreases to 0, then increases again up to 1/4 at t=1/2.

Wait, no. Wait, when t=0, g(t) = 1/4. As t increases to 1/4, g(t) decreases to 0. Then, as t goes beyond
