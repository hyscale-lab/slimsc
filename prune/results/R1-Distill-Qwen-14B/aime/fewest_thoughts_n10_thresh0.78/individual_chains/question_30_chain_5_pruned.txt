Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit involved, but let's see if I can break it down.

First off, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy the equation ω^n = 1 for some integer n. In this case, ω is a 13th root of unity, which means ω^13 = 1. Also, since ω ≠ 1, it's one of the primitive roots, right? So ω^k for k from 0 to 12 will cycle through all the 13th roots of unity, with ω^0 = 1.

The expression I need to evaluate is the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write that out mathematically to get a better sense:

Product = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

Hmm, so each term in the product is a quadratic in ω^k. Maybe I can factor each term or find a pattern that can simplify the product.

Let me consider a single term in the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let's factor this expression if possible. Maybe factor out 2: 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Not sure if that helps.

Wait, another approach: treat ω^{2k} as (ω^k)^2. So each term becomes 2 - 2ω^k + (ω^k)^2. Let me set x = ω^k, so the term becomes 2 - 2x + x².

So, 2 - 2x + x². Let me rearrange it as x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, can I factor this quadratic? Let's see: discriminant is (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)]/2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i.

So, x² - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Therefore, each term can be written as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)) where x = ω^k.

So substituting back, the term becomes (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product becomes:

Product = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Since multiplication is commutative, I can write this as:

(Product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))) multiplied by (Product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 - i))).

So, that's [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].

Now, I recall that for roots of unity, the product of (x - ω^k) for k=0 to n-1 is equal to x^n - 1. Because the roots are ω^0, ω^1, ..., ω^{n-1}, so their product is x^n - 1.

But wait, in this case, x isn't exactly the variable. Wait, no. Let me think. If I set x = 1 + i, then the product over k=0 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is equal to x^13 - 1, because all ω^k are the 13th roots of unity. Similarly, for x = 1 - i, the same applies.

Wait, let me verify that. The product over all (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is equal to x^13 - 1, because each ω^k is a root of x^13 - 1. So, indeed, the product is x^13 - 1.

Therefore, the first product is (1 + i)^13 - 1, and the second product is (1 - i)^13 - 1.

So, the entire product is [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1].

So, now I need to compute this expression.

But before that, perhaps I can write (1 + i) and (1
