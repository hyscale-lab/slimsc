Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

First, the hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. That's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening horizontally because the positive term is with x². The transverse axis is along the x-axis, and the conjugate axis is along the y-axis. 

The rhombus ABCD has its vertices on this hyperbola, and its diagonals intersect at the origin. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, rhombus diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals do bisect each other at right angles. Yeah, that's right. So the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points A, B, C, D must be symmetric with respect to the origin. So if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y), because it's the opposite vertex. Similarly, points B and D will be symmetric across the origin as well. So, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on. Let me think about how to express this.

But maybe there's another approach. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, we can parameterize the points on the hyperbola.

Let me recall that for a hyperbola, parametric equations can be written using hyperbolic functions. For the hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, the parametric coordinates are (a secθ, b tanθ). Alternatively, sometimes they use hyperbolic cosine and sine: (a cosh t, b sinh t). Maybe either can work, but perhaps using trigonometric parametrization is better here.

Wait, but hyperbola parametrization with trigonometric functions might not cover the entire hyperbola. Alternatively, I can think of points on the hyperbola as (x, y) where x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Since the rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, and the rhombus is symmetric about the origin, points A and C, as well as B and D, are reflections across the origin.

So, let me denote the points as A = (x1, y1), B = (x2, y2), C = (-x1, -y1), D = (-x2, -y2).

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are equal in length.

So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, etc.

But maybe it's easier to use vectors. Considering the diagonals, the diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, they must be straight lines passing through the origin. So, the diagonals are the lines connecting A to C and B to D.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal unless it's a square, but they bisect each other at right angles.

Wait, but in this case, the diagonals are AC and BD, with midpoint at the origin. So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, B is (p, q), D is (-p, -q).

So, the diagonals are AC and BD. The vectors AC and BD are ( -2x, -2y ) and ( -2p, -2q ), but since AC is from A to C, perhaps it's ( -x - x, -y - y ) = (-2x, -2y). But actually, the diagonal AC is from A to C, so the vector is C - A = (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is D - B = (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q).

But in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular. So their dot product should be zero.

Wait, the diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD. So,
