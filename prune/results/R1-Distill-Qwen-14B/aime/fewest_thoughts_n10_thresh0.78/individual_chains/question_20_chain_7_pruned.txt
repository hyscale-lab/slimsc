Okay, so I've got this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The problem states that there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable. We need to place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of a 5x5 grid, with each cell holding at most one chip. 

The conditions are:
1. Each cell can have at most one chip.
2. All chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for all chips in the same column.
3. Additionally, any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

Hmm, so this means that the placement must be such that every row and every column is either entirely filled with one color or completely empty. Because if a row has even one chip, then all the other cells in that row must also have that same color. Otherwise, you could add another chip of the same color without violating the conditions.

Wait, no, not necessarily entirely filled. Because the problem says that each cell can contain at most one chip, but the color condition applies to all chips in a row or column. So, perhaps each row could have some number of chips, all the same color, but not necessarily all 5 cells. But then, if a row has, say, 3 chips, then all those 3 must be the same color, and the rest of the row must be empty. Because otherwise, you could add another chip of the same color, which would still satisfy the same color condition for the row. So, no, that can't be. Because the problem says that any additional chip would violate the conditions. So if a row has some chips, then adding another of the same color would not violate the conditions, which contradicts the third condition. Therefore, each row must be either completely empty or completely filled with the same color. 

Wait, let me think. Suppose a row has 2 white chips. Then, according to condition 2, all chips in that row must be white, but that doesn't mean the row must be completely filled. Because the cells without chips can just remain empty. But then, according to condition 3, you can't add another chip without violating the conditions. So, if a row has 2 white chips, you can't add another white chip because that would add another white chip to the same row, which is allowed by condition 2. So that would violate condition 3. Therefore, that situation is impossible. So, each row must be either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly for each column.

Wait, same thing goes for columns. So, each row and each column must be entirely of one color or entirely empty. Because otherwise, you could add another chip of the same color in the same row or column without violating the conditions. So, to satisfy condition 3, each row and column must be either completely filled with a single color or completely empty.

So, the grid must be such that every row is either all white, all black, or empty, and the same goes for every column. Now, but wait, we also have a limited number of chips: 25 white and 25 black. Since the grid is 5x5, which is 25 cells. So, the total number of
