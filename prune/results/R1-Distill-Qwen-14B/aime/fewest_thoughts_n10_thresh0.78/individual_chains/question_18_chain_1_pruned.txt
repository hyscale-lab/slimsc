Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the number of rectangles in a regular dodecagon. Hmm, a dodecagon has 12 sides, right? And each side is equal in length. The question says that each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. 

Wait, rectangles in a polygon... I remember that in a regular polygon, especially with a lot of sides, you can form rectangles by connecting non-adjacent vertices. But I need to think about how exactly that works.

First, I should visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides and angles equal. Each internal angle is 150 degrees because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, which for n=12 gives 150 degrees. But maybe that's not directly relevant here.

So, the problem is about counting rectangles. Each rectangle is defined by four points (vertices) in the dodecagon. But not all sets of four points form a rectangle. They have to form a rectangle with sides on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

Wait, but in a regular polygon, the sides and diagonals have specific lengths. For a dodecagon, the number of diagonals is given by n(n-3)/2, which for n=12 would be 12*9/2 = 54 diagonals. Plus 12 sides, so total 66 lines. But I don't know if that number is directly helpful yet.

I remember that in a regular polygon, rectangles can be formed by selecting pairs of parallel sides. For example, in a regular hexagon, you can form rectangles by choosing opposite sides, but since a hexagon is six-sided, maybe that's a simpler case.

Wait, but a regular dodecagon has more sides, so perhaps there are more possibilities for rectangles. Let me think about how rectangles can be formed here.

In a regular polygon, rectangles typically require that the opposite sides are both sides or diagonals of the polygon and are parallel. So, to form a rectangle, I need two pairs of parallel lines, each pair being either sides or diagonals of the polygon.

In a regular dodecagon, each side has a certain number of parallel sides. For example, in a regular polygon, sides are separated by equal angles. So, for a dodecagon, each side is separated by 30 degrees (since 360/12=30). So, sides that are k steps apart (k=1,2,...,5) will be at different angles.

But wait, for a rectangle, the opposite sides must be parallel. So, in the dodecagon, sides that are directly opposite each other would be 6 steps apart because 12/2=6. For example, starting at vertex 1, the opposite vertex is 7. So, the side from 1 to 2 and the side from 7 to
