Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.

First, the definition: A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. One, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Two, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81).

So, I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n that satisfy these conditions.

Let me break this down step by step.

Firstly, any two-digit number in base b can be written as n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can range from 1 to b-1 (since the first digit can't be zero), and c can range from 0 to b-1.

The sum of the digits is a + c, and according to the problem, this should equal sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) = a + c.

But n is also equal to a*b + c. So, substituting, we get sqrt(a*b + c) = a + c.

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

Expanding the right side: (a + c)^2 = a^2 + 2ac + c^2.

So now, the equation is:

a*b + c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2.

Let me rearrange this equation to solve for b:

a*b = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c.

Divide both sides by a (since a is at least 1, it's safe to divide):

b = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a.

Hmm, so b must be an integer. That means that (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a, right? Because the entire right-hand side must be an integer. So, (c^2 - c) must be a multiple of a.

Let me write that as:

(c^2 - c) ≡ 0 mod a.

Which can be factored as:

c(c - 1) ≡ 0 mod a.

So, a must divide c(c - 1). Since a and c are digits in base b, a can be up to b-1, and c can be up to b-1 as well.

But since a is at least 1 and at most b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1, I can use this condition to find possible a and c pairs for a given b.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the equation differently to make it easier to handle.

We had:

b = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a.

Let me factor out the (c^2 - c)/a term as (c(c - 1))/a, so:

b = a + 2c + (c(c - 1))/a.

Hmm, perhaps to make this manageable, I can let k = a. Then, b must be an integer, so (c(c - 1)) must be a multiple of k.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the equation to find a quadratic in terms of c.

Wait, let me go back to the equation:

n = a*b + c

sqrt(n) = a + c.

Therefore, n = (a + c)^2.

So, a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

Let me rearrange:

(a + c)^2 - a*b - c = 0.

Expanding (a + c)^2:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0.

Hmm, maybe factor this differently. Let me group terms:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0.

Let me factor a from some of the terms:

a² + a*(2c - b) + c² - c = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in a:

a² + a*(2c - b) + (c² - c) = 0.

Alternatively, perhaps as a quadratic in c. Let me see:

The equation is:

c² + (2a - 1)c + (a² - a*b) = 0.

Wait, let me check that:

Starting from a*b + c =
