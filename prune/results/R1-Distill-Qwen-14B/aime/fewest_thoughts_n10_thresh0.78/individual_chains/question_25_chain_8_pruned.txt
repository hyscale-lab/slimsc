Alright, so I've got this math problem here about residents of Aimeville and the things they own. Hmm, let me try to make sense of it step by step. Okay, so the total number of residents is 900. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts, which is good to know. Then, there's data about how many own other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. 

Let me jot down the numbers to keep track. So, the number of people owning a diamond ring (let's call this D) is 195. Golf clubs (G) are owned by 367 people. Garden spades (S) are owned by 562. And everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (H), so that's 900. 

Wait, the problem mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We need to find how many own all four. Hmm, okay, this sounds like a inclusion-exclusion principle problem. I remember that the inclusion-exclusion principle helps calculate the union of multiple sets by considering their intersections.

Let me recall the formula for four sets. The total number of elements in the union of four sets A, B, C, D is equal to the sum of the sizes of each set minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the sum of all triple-wise intersections minus the size of the four-way intersection. But wait, in our case, everyone owns at least the candy hearts, so H is a universal set here. So, the other items (D, G, S) are subsets of H. So, maybe I need to model this using H as the universe.

Wait, but the problem statement says that each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts. So, every resident owns H. That means that the sets D, G, S are all subsets of H, which has 900 elements. So, the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S, or H is 900. Because H is a given to all.

But since H is given to everyone, maybe the problem is actually about the other three items, but since H is always present, it's part of everything. So, maybe the problem
