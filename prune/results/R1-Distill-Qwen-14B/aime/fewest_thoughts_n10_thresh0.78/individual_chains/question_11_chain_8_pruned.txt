Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, alright, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that any complex number z can be written in polar form because its magnitude is given. Since |z| = 4, I can write z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That might make things easier because working with exponentials can sometimes simplify multiplication and division.

So, if z = 4e^{iθ}, then 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. That's because 1/z is the conjugate of z divided by |z| squared, which in this case is 16, but maybe I should verify that. Let me see: z times 1/z should be 1, right? So, z*(1/z) = 1, which makes sense. So, yes, 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Now, substituting z and 1/z into the original expression:

(75 + 117i)*(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)*[(1/4)e^{-iθ}].

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ} = (75*4 + 117*4i)e^{iθ} = (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So the entire expression becomes: (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Now, I need to find the real part of this expression. To find the real part, I can use Euler's formula, which says that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, let's expand both terms:

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Similarly, the second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 = -1, so this becomes 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Now, let's collect like terms for both expressions.

For the first term:

Real parts: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Imaginary parts: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ.

For the second term:

Real parts: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Imaginary parts: -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ.

Now, adding these together:

Total real part = [300 cosθ - 468 sinθ] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ] = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Total imaginary part = [300 sinθ + 468 cosθ] + [-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ] = (300 -24) sinθ + (468 +36) cosθ = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

But since we're only interested in the real part, we can focus on that: 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, the expression we're trying to maximize is Re = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, this looks like a linear combination of sine and cosine, which I know can be written as a single sinusoid. The maximum value of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). Wait, actually, the maximum is sqrt(A² + B²). But in this case, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So, the maximum real part would be sqrt(324² + 432²).

Wait, let me make sure. The general formula is that for any expression like C cosθ + D sinθ, the maximum value is sqrt(C² + D²). So, yes, in this case, C is 324 and D is -432. So, the maximum Re is sqrt(324² + 432²).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324 squared: 324 * 324. Hmm, 300 squared is 90,000, 24 squared is 576, and cross term 2*300*24 = 14,400. So, (300 +24)^2 = 90,000 +14,400 +576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, cross term 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400 +32)^2=160,000 +25,600 +1,024=186,624.

Now, sum 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

sqrt(291,600). Let me see, 540^2 is 291,600 because 500^2=250,000 and 40^2=1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000. So, 540^2 = (500 +40)^2=500² + 2*500*40 +40²=250,000+40,000+1,600=291,600.

So, sqrt(291,600) is 540. Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but hold on. Let's make sure I didn't make a mistake in the signs. The expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So, if I write this as A cosθ + B sinθ, it's 324
