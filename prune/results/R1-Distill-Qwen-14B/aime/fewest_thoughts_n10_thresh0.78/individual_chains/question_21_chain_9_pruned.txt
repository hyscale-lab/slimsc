Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are satisfied:
1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. So, in base b, n would look like "ab" where a and b are digits in base b. 
2. The sum of these two digits (a + b) equals the square root of n, which is sqrt(n).

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81).

So, my task is to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n that satisfy these conditions.

Let me break down the problem.

First, representing n in base b: n has exactly two digits, so it can be written as n = a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a must be between 1 and b-1 (since leading digits can't be zero), and c must be between 0 and b-1.

Next, the sum of the digits is a + c, and this sum equals sqrt(n). So, from condition 2, we have:

a + c = sqrt(n)

But n is a * b + c, so substituting n in the equation:

a + c = sqrt(a * b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a * b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a * b + c

Let me rearrange the equation to bring all terms to one side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a * b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe I can rearrange terms in terms of a and c.

Wait, let me see if I can write this equation in terms of a and c.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express b in terms of a and c.

From (a + c)^2 = a*b + c, let's solve for b:

a*b = (a + c)^2 - c

So,

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a

Simplify the numerator:

(a + c)^2 - c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c

So,

b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a

We can split this fraction into terms:

b = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a

Since b must be an integer (base), the term (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a. So, a must be a divisor of (c^2 - c).

So, (c^2 - c) mod a = 0.

So, a | (c^2 - c). That is, a divides c(c - 1).

Given that a is between 1 and b - 1, but since n is a two-digit number in base b, a is at least 1 and at most b-1. But more importantly, a must divide c(c - 1).

Now, let's note that c is a digit in base b, so c is between 0 and b-1. But since in the two-digit number, c can be zero.

Wait, but n must be a positive integer, which it is because it's a two-digit number in base b, so a is at least 1, but c can be zero.

But in the example, 81 is 63 in base 13, so c is 3. So, c can be from 0 up to b-1.

So, for each base b, we can consider all possible a and c such that a is from 1 to b-1, c is from 0 to b-1, and a divides c(c - 1). Then, for each such pair (a, c), b is computed as above, and we can check whether b is indeed consistent.

Wait, but wait a second. For each pair (a, c), we can compute a corresponding b, but for a given b, we need to find all (a, c) such that the above equation holds. So, perhaps instead of iterating over b and then a and c, it's better to iterate over possible a and c, compute b, and then check if b is compatible with a and c.

But that might be a bit complicated. Alternatively, for a given b, we can iterate through all possible a (from 1 to b-1) and c (from 0 to b-1), check if a divides c(c - 1), compute b from the expression, and if the computed b equals the given b, then count that n as a b-eautiful number.

Wait, but for a given b, n is a two-digit number in base b, so n = a*b + c, and a and c are digits in base b. So, for each b, we can iterate a from 1 to b-1, and c from 0 to b-1, and check whether (a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Alternatively, for each b, the number of
