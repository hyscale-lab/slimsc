Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about triangle ABC. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the details.

The problem says that triangle ABC has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB multiplied by AC.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by recalling some basic definitions and properties related to circumcenters and incenters.

First, the circumcenter O is the center of the circumscribed circle around the triangle. It's the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle's sides. The circumradius R is given as 13, so that's the radius of this circle.

The incenter I is the center of the inscribed circle, which is tangent to all three sides of the triangle. The inradius r is given as 6. The inradius is the radius of this inscribed circle.

Now, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. That means the line segment from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line segment from the incenter I to the circumcenter O.

I think it would help to visualize this. Maybe I should draw triangle ABC with O and I somewhere inside. But without knowing the type of triangle, it's a bit tricky. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry? Or perhaps there's a relationship between the inradius, circumradius, and the sides of the triangle that I can use.

Wait, the problem is asking for AB multiplied by AC. Let's denote the sides opposite to A, B, and C as a, b, and c respectively. So, side BC is a, AC is b, and AB is c. Then, AB multiplied by AC would be c * b.

But wait, actually, no. Let me correct that. In standard notation, side a is opposite vertex A, which is BC, side b is opposite vertex B, which is AC, and side c is opposite vertex C, which is AB. So, AB is c and AC is b. Therefore, AB multiplied by AC is c * b. So, we're looking for the product of sides c and b.

Now, I need to find a way to relate the given information (IA perpendicular to OI, R=13, r=6) to the sides of the triangle, particularly c and b.

I remember there are formulas that relate the inradius, circumradius, and other elements of a triangle. For example, the area of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter: Area = r * s, where s is the semiperimeter. Also, the area can be expressed in terms of the circumradius and the sides: Area = (a * b * c) / (4R).

So, maybe I can set these equal or find another relation.

But before that, let's think about the perpendicularity condition: IA is perpendicular to OI.

I need to find a relationship involving IA and OI. Maybe I can express vectors or coordinates for these segments.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry. Let's try to set up a coordinate system where point I is at (0, 0) since it's the in
