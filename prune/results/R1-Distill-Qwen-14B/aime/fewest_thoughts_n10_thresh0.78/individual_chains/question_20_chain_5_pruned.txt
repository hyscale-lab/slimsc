Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again and try to figure it out step by step. The problem is about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they are indistinguishable, meaning I can't tell one white chip from another, same with black. Each cell can hold at most one chip. The conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must also be the same color. Plus, the arrangement should be such that if I try to add any more chips, I'd violate one of those conditions.

Hmm. So, I need to count the number of ways to place these chips under those constraints.

Let me think. Since each row must have chips of the same color, each row is either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column must be all white, all black, or empty. But wait, each cell can have at most one chip, so if a row is all white, it's because every cell in that row has a white chip. Alternatively, if a row is all black, all cells have black chips. If a row is empty, no chips there. Same for columns.

Wait, but the chips are placed in the cells such that each cell has at most one chip. So, for each row, either it's all white, all black, or empty. Similarly for each column.

But also, the placement must be maximal, meaning you can't add any more chips without violating the same-row or same-column color conditions.

So, first, the grid must be arranged such that every row is either all white, all black, or empty, and every column is either all white, all black, or empty. But since each cell can have at most one chip, if a row is all white, all its cells have white chips. Similarly for black.

Wait, but if a row is all white, then all its columns must have white chips in that row. But if a column is supposed to have the same color, but another row in that column has a different color, that might cause a conflict.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the entire grid must be divided into blocks of rows and columns that are all white or all black, and these blocks can't interfere with each other. So, the grid is partitioned into rectangular regions where each region is entirely white or entirely black.

But each row and column must be monochromatic. So perhaps the grid is covered by rectangles (could be single cells) that are all the same color, and these rectangles don't overlap.

Wait, no, actually, since each row and column must be monochromatic, the arrangement is such that each row is a single color, and each column is a single color. So, the color of each cell is determined by its row and column, but they have to agree.

Wait, that seems a bit conflicting. Because if a row is white, all cells in that row are white, but then each column must be all white or all black, but some of these columns would have to be white because of the white row.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this as each row being either white, black, or empty, and each column as well. But the colors have to agree where they intersect.

Let me consider the grid as a matrix where each cell (i,j) must be either white, black, or empty. But with the constraints that all cells in row i are the same color (if they're not empty), and all cells in column j are the same color (if they're not empty). But if a cell is non-empty, it has to satisfy both the row and column color.

So, if in row i, the color is white, then all non-empty cells in that row are white. Similarly, if column j is white, all non-empty cells in that column are white. So, if both row i and column j are white, then cell (i,j) is white. If row i is white and column j is black, then cell (i,j) can't have a chip because it can't be both white and black. So, such a cell must be empty.

Wait, but this
