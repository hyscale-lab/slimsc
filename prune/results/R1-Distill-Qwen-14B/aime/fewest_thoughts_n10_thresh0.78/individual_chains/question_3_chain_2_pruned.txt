Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen four. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen.

The question is asking for the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention expressing this probability as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then finding m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. I remember the formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B), where A is the event of winning the grand prize and B is the event of winning a prize.

So, I need to find P(A|B). Let's define the events:

- Let A be the event that Jen wins the grand prize, which means all four of her numbers are chosen.
- Let B be the event that Jen wins a prize, which means at least two of her numbers are chosen.

So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B), because if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize, so P(A and B) is just P(A).

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If she has all four numbers, then she definitely has at least two, so yes, A is a subset of B. So, P(A and B) is just P(A). So, the formula simplifies to P(A)/P(B).

So, I need to compute P(A) and P(B).

First, let's understand the setup. The lottery is based on choosing 4 numbers from 10. So, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). I can compute that.

C(10,4) is 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So, the total number of possible ways to choose the 4 numbers is 210.

Now, Jen picks 4 distinct numbers as well. The probability calculations will involve combinations, so let's get started.

First, let's compute P(A). P(A) is the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen. So, how many favorable outcomes are there? Well, since the lottery picks 4 numbers, and she has exactly 4, there's only one way this can happen: the lottery picks exactly her four numbers. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1.

Hence, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because wait, no. Wait, I think I might have a confusion here. Let me clarify.

No, wait, actually, no. The total number of possible lottery draws is 210, as we said. The number of favorable outcomes for A is 1, because only her specific set of four numbers would be the winning set. So, yes, P(A) is 1/210.

Now, let's compute P(B), the probability that she wins a prize, which is when at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, she could have exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of her numbers chosen. That's when she wins a prize.

So, the number of favorable outcomes for B is the sum of the number of ways she can have exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of her numbers chosen.

So, mathematically, the number of favorable outcomes is C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0). Let me explain each term:

- C(4,2)*C(6,2): This is the number of ways to choose exactly two of her four numbers and the remaining two from the other six numbers not chosen by Jen.
- Similarly, C(4,3)*C(6,1) is for exactly three of her numbers and one from the others.
- C(4,4)*C(6,0) is for exactly four of her numbers, which is just 1 way.

So, let me compute each term.

First, C(4,2) is 6, and C(6,2) is 15. So, 6 * 15 = 90.

Next, C(4,3) is 4, and C(6,1) is 6. So, 4 * 6 = 24.

Then, C(4,4) is 1, and C(6,0) is 1. So, 1 * 1 = 1.

Adding them up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

So, the number of favorable outcomes for B is 115. Hence, P(B) is 115 / 210.

Wait, let me make sure that adds up correctly. 90 + 24 is 114, plus 1 is 115. Yes, that's correct.

So, P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 115/210.

So, the
