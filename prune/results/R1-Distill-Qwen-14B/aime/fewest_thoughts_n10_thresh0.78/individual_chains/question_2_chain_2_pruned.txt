Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand it.

We have points O, A, and B with coordinates O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between 0 and 1, and B is on the y-axis a bit higher than halfway, since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

Then, there's a family F of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant. Each of these segments has point P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So PQ is a segment connecting some point (p, 0) to (0, q), with p and q positive, and the length of PQ is 1.

The problem states that there's a unique point C on segment AB, not A or B, that doesn't belong to any other segment from F except AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments, right? Because AB connects A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), and I should check if its length is 1.

Let me calculate the length of AB. The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. Yes, so AB is a member of F.

So, the family F includes all such segments of length 1 from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. Each segment PQ in F can be described by points (p, 0) and (0, q) such that p^2 + q^2 = 1^2 = 1, because the distance between them is 1. Wait, is that right? Because the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is sqrt(p^2 + q^2). So, for PQ to have length 1, we must have p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So each PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q) where p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, all these segments are part of the family F.

Now, the point C is on AB, not equal to A or B, and it doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is the only segment in F that passes through C. So, C is the only point on AB that no other PQ in F passes through except AB.

We need to find OC^2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.

Alright, so first, let's parametrize AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the line AB can be parameterized.

Let me find the parametric equations for AB. Let's say t is a parameter from 0 to 1. When t=0, we are at A(1/2, 0), and when t=1, we are at B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So the parametric equations are:

x = 1/2 - (1/2)t

y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2) t

So, x = (1 - t)/2, y = (sqrt(3)/2) t, with t ∈ [0,1].

Thus, any point C on AB can be written as ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3)/2) t ) for some t between 0 and 1, excluding t=0 and t=1 because C is not A or B.

Now, the point C is on AB, so it's ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3)/2) t ). We need to find C such that no other segment PQ in F passes through C except AB.

So, for any other segment PQ in F (i.e., with P ≠ A and Q ≠ B), C is not on PQ.

So, we need to find point C on AB such that it's not on any other PQ in F.

Alternatively, C is the only point on AB that lies on exactly one segment from F, which is AB itself.

So, how do we approach this? Maybe we can consider the envelope of all these segments PQ in F. The envelope would be the curve that is tangent to all these segments, and the point C might lie on this envelope. Since C is the only point on AB not lying on any other PQ, perhaps it's the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F, meaning that C is the point of tangency.

So, maybe the envelope of all the segments PQ in F is a curve, and AB is tangent to this curve at point C. So, point C is the point where AB touches the envelope of F.

Thus, if I can find the envelope of all these segments PQ, I can find the point where AB is tangent to this envelope, and that point would be C.

So, let's try to find the envelope of the family F.

Each segment PQ is defined by points (p, 0) and (0, q), where p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Wait, but wait: if p^2 + q^2 = 1, then the line PQ can be written as
