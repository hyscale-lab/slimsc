Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2.

Hmm, so first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p squared divides n^4 + 1 for some positive integer n. Once I find that p, I have to find the smallest m with the same property: m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2.

Let me think about primes and their properties. Primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The primes start at 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.

I remember that for a prime p, if p divides a^k + b^k, there are certain conditions, especially when k is a power of 2. But I'm not sure exactly how that applies here.

Wait, the problem is about n^4 + 1 being divisible by p^2. So, p^2 divides n^4 + 1. That means that n^4 ≡ -1 mod p^2.

So, first, I need to find the smallest prime p where such an n exists.

Let me start checking primes one by one, starting from the smallest.

First, p=2.

Check if 2^2 =4 divides n^4 +1 for some n.

Let's test n=1: 1^4 +1=2. 2 mod 4 is 2, which isn't 0. So not divisible by 4.

n=2: 16 +1=17, which mod4 is 1. Not divisible.

n=3: 81+1=82, mod4 is 2. Not divisible.

n=4: 256 +1=257, mod4 is 1. Hmm, it seems for p=2, n^4 +1 is never divisible by 4. Because n^4 is always 0 or 1 mod4.

Wait, if n is even: n=2k, n^4 = (2k)^4 = 16k^4 ≡0 mod4. So n^4 +1 ≡1 mod4.

If n is odd: n=2k+1, n^4 = (2k+1)^4. Let me compute that modulo4.

(2k+1)^2 =4k^2 +4k +1 ≡1 mod4. Then, (2k+1)^4 = (1)^2 =1 mod4. So n^4 +1 ≡2 mod4.

So, no n will make n^4 +1 divisible by 4. So p=2 is out.

Next prime: p=3.

Check if 3^2=9 divides n^4 +1 for some n.

Compute n^4 modulo9.

Possible residues modulo9: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Compute n^4 mod9 for n=0 to 8.

n=0: 0^4=0 mod9: 0
n=1:1
n=2:16 mod9=7
n=3:81 mod9=0
n=4: 256 mod9: 256 divided by 9 is 28*9=252, remainder 4. So 4.
n=5: 625 mod9: 625 - 69*9=625-621=4. So 4.
Wait, 625 divided by 9: 9*69=621, 625-621=4. So 4.
n=6: 6^4=1296 mod9: 1296 is 144*9=1296, so 0.
n=7: 7^4=2401 mod9: Let's compute 2401/9: 9*266=2394, 2401-2394=7. So 7.
n=8: 8^4=4096 mod9: Let's compute 4096/9. 9*455=4095, so 4096=4095+1, so 1 mod9.

So n^4 mod9 for n=0 to8: 0,1,7,0,4,4,0,7,1.

So n^4 +1 mod9 would be:

n=0:1
n=1:2
n=2:8
n=3:1
n=4:5
n=5:5
n=6:1
n=7:8
n=8:2

So looking for 0 mod9, but none of the residues are 0. So 9 doesn't divide n^4 +1 for any n. So p=3 is out.

Next prime: p=5.

Check if 25 divides n^4 +1 for some n.

We can approach this by first finding n such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod5, and then see if it can be lifted to mod25.

Wait, first, check if -1 is a quartic residue modulo5.

Compute n^4 mod5 for n=0,1,2,3,4.

n=0:0
n=1:1
n=2:16 mod5=1
n=3:81 mod5=1
n=4:256 mod5=1

So n^4 mod5 can be 0 or1. So -1 mod5 is 4. So n^4 ≡4 mod5. But from above, n^4 mod5 is either 0 or1. So there's no solution. So 5 is out.

Next prime: p=7.

Check if 49 divides n^4 +1 for some n.

First, check if n^4 ≡-1 mod7.

Compute n^4 mod7 for n=0 to6.

n=0:0
n=1:1
n=2:16 mod7=2
n=3:81 mod7= 81-11*7=81-77=4
n=4:256 mod7. 256 ÷7: 7*36=252, so 256-252=4. So 4.
n=5:625 mod7: 625 ÷7=89*7=623, 625-623=2. So 2.
n=6:1296 mod7: 1296 ÷7: 7*185=1295, so 1296-1295=1. So 1.

So n^4 mod7: 0,1,2,4,4,2,1.

Looking for n^4 ≡-1 mod7, which is 6 mod7. But none of the residues are 6. So no solution mod7. So p=7 is out.

Next prime: p=11.

Wait, before moving to higher primes, is there a smarter way? Maybe I can recall some theorems about primes dividing n^k +1.

I remember that for a prime p, if p divides n^k +1, then the order of n modulo p must divide 2k. Also, since n^{2k} ≡1 modp, the multiplicative order of n modulo p divides 2k. Hmm, but since n^k ≡-1 modp, the order can't divide k, so it must be exactly 2d where d divides k. Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that if p is an odd prime and p divides n^4 +1, then the order of n modulo p divides 8, because n^8 ≡1 modp. So the multiplicative order must divide 8. But n^4 ≡-1 modp, so the order cannot divide 4, hence the order is 8. Therefore, 8 must divide p-1, by Fermat's little theorem. So p ≡1 mod8.

So primes p that are 1 mod8 can have solutions to n^4 ≡-1 modp.

So the primes to check are 17, 97, etc., but the smallest primes are 17, 41, 73, 89, 97, etc.

Wait, but I had primes like 3, 5, 7, etc., which are not 1 mod8. So for p=3, 3 ≡3 mod8, p=5≡5, p=7≡7, p=11≡3, p=13≡5, p=17≡1, p=19≡3, p=23≡7, etc. So the first primes ≡1 mod8 are 17, 41, 73, etc.

Wait, but in my earlier checks, p=3,5,7, etc., didn't work. But maybe for p=17, we can have n^4 +1 divisible by 17^2=289.

So, perhaps p=17 is the least prime where p^2 divides n^4 +1 for some n.

Let me check p=17.

So I need to find if there exists an n such that n^4 ≡-1 mod17^2=289.

First, check if there exists n with n^4 ≡-1 mod17.

As before, for p=17, which is 1 mod8, so solutions may exist.

Compute n^4 mod17.

Compute n=1 to8:

n=1:1
n=2:16
n=3:81 mod17=13
n=4:256 mod17: 256/17=15*17=255, so 256=255+1 →1
n=5:625 mod17. 17*36=612, 625-612=13. So 13.
n=6:6^4=1296 mod17. Let's compute 17*76=1292, so 1296-1292=4. So 4.
n=7:7^4=2401 mod17. 17*141=2397, 2401-2397=4. So 4.
n=8:8^4=4096 mod17. 17*241=4097, so 4096=4097-1 →-1 mod17=16.

So n=8: 8^4 ≡16 mod17, which is -1 mod17.

So n=8 is a solution to n^4 ≡-1 mod17.

Now, we can try to lift this solution to modulo 17^2=289 using Hensel's lemma.

Hensel's lemma says that if f(n)=n^4 +1, and f(n)≡0 modp, and f’(n) not≡0 modp, then there's a unique lift modulo p^2.

Compute f’(n)=4n^3.

At n=8 mod17, f’(8)=4*(8)^3.

Compute 8^3=512. 512 mod17: 17*30=510, so 512=510+2 →2 mod17.

So f’(8)=4*2=8 mod17. Since 8≠0 mod17, the derivative is non-zero, so Hensel's lemma applies, and there exists a unique lift of n=8 mod17 to modulo289.

So let me find n=8 +17k such that n^4 ≡-1 mod289.

Compute n=8 +17k.

Compute n^4: (8 +17k)^4.

But expanding this would be tedious. Instead, perhaps we can compute n^4 mod289.

Let me compute 8^4 mod289.

8^2=64, 8^4=(64)^2=4096.

4096 divided by289: 289*14=4046, 4096-4046=50. So 8^4=4096≡50 mod289.

But we need n^4 ≡-1 mod289, which is 288 mod289.

So 50 ≠288, so n=8 mod17 is not a solution mod289. So we need to adjust k.

Let me compute f(n) =n^4 +1 mod289, where n=8 +17k.

Compute f(8 +17k) ≡ (8 +17k)^4 +1 mod289.

We can use the binomial theorem to expand this, but modulo289.

Note that 17^2=289, so any term with (17k)^2 or higher will be 0 mod289.

So, (8 +17k)^4 ≡8^4 + 4*8^3*(17k) + 6*8^2*(17k)^2 + 4*8*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

But modulo289, (17k)^2 and higher powers are 0. So only the first two terms matter.

So, (8 +17k)^4 ≡8^4 +4*8^3*(17k) mod289.

Compute each term:

8^4=4096. As before, 4096 mod289: 289*14=4046, 4096-4046=50. So 8^4 ≡50 mod289.

4*8^3*(17k): 4*512*(17k). Wait, 8^3=512. 512 mod289: 289*1=289, 512-289=223. So 8^3≡223 mod289.

So, 4*223*(17k) mod289.

Compute 4*223=892. 892 mod289: 289*3=867, 89
