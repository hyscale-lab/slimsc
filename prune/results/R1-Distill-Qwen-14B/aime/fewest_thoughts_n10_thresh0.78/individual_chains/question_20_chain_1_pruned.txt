Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the number of ways to place some chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips. Each cell can have at most one chip. So, no two chips in the same cell, whether same color or not. Got it.

The main conditions are:
1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Additionally, any extra chip placed would violate one or both of the first two conditions. So the arrangement must be maximal in the sense that adding another chip isn't possible without breaking the row or column color rules.

Hmm, so each row must be all white or all black, but you can choose for each row independently. Similarly for each column. But wait, no, because if I fix the color for each row, the column constraints might conflict.

Wait, this seems tricky. Let's think about it.

Suppose I decide the color for each row. For each row, I can choose white or black. So there are 2^5 = 32 possible color assignments for rows. Similarly, for columns, 2^5 = 32. But these assignments have to be consistent with each other because the cells where both a row and column are colored must agree.

Wait, so if I have a cell at (i,j), the color is determined by both row i and column j. So they must be the same. Therefore, the color assignments for rows and columns must be such that for every cell (i,j), the color of row i is the same as the color of column j.

Wait, that seems too restrictive. Let me think. If row i is white, then every cell in row i must be white. Similarly, if column j is black, every cell in column j must be black. But in cell (i,j), which is in row i and column j, it can have a chip only if both the row and column agree on the color. So if row i is white and column j is black, then cell (i,j) cannot have a chip. But if row i is white and column j is white, then cell (i,j) can have a white chip. Similarly for black.

Wait, but if both row i and column j are white, I can choose to place a white chip there or
