Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it and understand what's going on. The problem says:

Let ABC be a triangle inscribed in circle ω. The tangents to ω at B and C intersect at point D. Then, line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given that AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find the length of AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, first, let me draw this in my mind. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. It's inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at D, so D is outside the circle, and AD intersects the circle again at P. We need to find AP.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point outside a circle, the lengths from that point to the points of tangency are equal. So, DB = DC. That might come in handy.

Also, since AD is a secant intersecting the circle at A and P, there might be a power of a point involved here. The power of point D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² (since DB is the tangent from D to ω). So, Power of a Point theorem says DB² = DA * DP. Because D is outside the circle, and AD is a secant line.

So, if I can find DA, then I can use this to find DP, and since AP = AD - DP, I can find AP.

Wait, but I don't know DA yet. So, maybe I need to find DA first. How can I find DA?

Alternatively, maybe I can use triangle similarities or other properties. Let's think.

First, let's note the sides of triangle ABC: AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. Let me see if it's a right-angled triangle. Let's check: 5² + 9² = 25 + 81 = 106. 10² is 100. Not equal, so it's not a right-angled triangle. Hmm.

Maybe I can find some angles using the Law of Cosines. Let me compute angle at A, B, or C.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinates would help. Maybe assigning coordinates to points A, B, C, then finding D, then finding P, then computing AP.

Hmm, coordinates might get a bit messy, but let's see.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry but setting point C at the origin, as in the Asymptote code. That might simplify things.

Wait, looking back at the Asymptote code: it defines point C at the origin, point A at (10, 0), and point B at (7.8, 4.4899). Hmm, that seems specific. Maybe this is a coordinate system where C is at (0,0), A is at (10,0), and B is somewhere in the plane.

But maybe I don't need to use the exact coordinates given in the Asymptote code. Instead, I can set up a coordinate system for myself.

Let me try to place point C at (0,0), point A at (10,0), so AC is along the x-axis with length 10. Then point B is somewhere in the plane. I need to find its coordinates.

Given AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10.

So, coordinates: C(0,0), A(10,0), and B(x,y). We need to find (x,y).

So, distance from A to B is 5: sqrt((x - 10)^2 + y^2) = 5 => (x-10)^2 + y^2 = 25.

Distance from B to C is 9: sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 9 => x^2 + y^2 = 81.

So, subtract the two equations:

(x^2 + y^2) - [(x - 10)^2 + y^2] = 81 - 25 => x^2 - (x^2 - 20x + 100) = 56 => 20x - 100 = 56 => 20x = 156 => x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.

Oh, so x is 7
