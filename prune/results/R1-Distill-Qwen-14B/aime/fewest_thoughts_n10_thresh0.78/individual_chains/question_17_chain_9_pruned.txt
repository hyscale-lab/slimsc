Okay, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, and then compute r squared, express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and finally find p+q. Hmm, sounds a bit involved, but let me break it down.

First, let's recall that a rectangular box has three dimensions: length, width, and height. Let's denote them as x, y, z. So, the surface area S of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54. And the volume V is xyz = 23. 

Now, the sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of the box can be found using the formula d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, so r = d/2 = sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2. So, our goal is to minimize r, which is equivalent to minimizing sqrt(x² + y² + z²), but actually, since we're squaring it later, maybe we can just minimize x² + y² + z².

Wait, but the sphere needs to contain the box regardless of its orientation, right? So is the space diagonal the correct measure? Hmm, yes, because the sphere has to enclose the entire box, so the sphere's diameter must at least be the space diagonal of the box. So, to find the smallest sphere, we need to minimize the space diagonal, which would correspond to the minimal enclosing sphere.

But wait, actually, if the box can be oriented in any way within the sphere, maybe the minimal sphere is determined by the maximum extent of the box in any direction. Hmm, no, I think the space diagonal is the right approach because regardless of orientation, the sphere must contain all eight corners of the box, which are separated by the space diagonal. So, regardless of how you rotate the box, the sphere's diameter must be at least the space diagonal.

So, yes, the radius r is (sqrt(x² + y² + z²))/2. So, we need to minimize x² + y² + z² given the constraints of surface area 54 and volume 23.

So, the problem is to minimize f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z² subject to the constraints g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23.

This seems like a constrained optimization problem. I think I can use Lagrange multipliers for this.

Let me set up the Lagrangian function. Let’s denote λ and μ as the Lagrange multipliers for the constraints g and h, respectively. So,

L(x, y, z, λ, μ) = x² + y² + z² - λ(2(xy + yz + zx) - 54) - μ(xyz - 23)

Then, we take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, λ, μ and set them equal to zero.

Compute the partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(2y + 2z) - μ(yz) = 0
∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(2x + 2z) - μ(xz) = 0
∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(2x + 2y) - μ(xy) = 0
∂L/∂λ = -(2xy + 2yz + 2zx - 54) = 0
∂L/∂μ = -(xyz - 23) = 0

So, now we have a system of equations:

1. 2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ yz = 0
2. 2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ xz = 0
3. 2z - 2λ(x + y) - μ xy = 0
4. 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54
5. xyz = 23

Hmm, okay, so that's five equations with five variables: x, y, z, λ, μ. Looks complicated, but maybe we can find some symmetry or relationships between x, y, z.

I notice that equations 1, 2, 3 are symmetric in x, y, z. So perhaps the minimal occurs when x = y = z? Let me check that.

If x = y = z, then the box is a cube. Let's see what the surface area and volume would be.

Surface area of a cube is 6x², so 6x² = 54 => x² = 9 => x = 3. Then volume would be x³ = 27. But we need volume 23, which is less than 27. So, a cube with surface area 54 has volume 27, which is more than 23. So, the minimal enclosing sphere for a cube would have radius sqrt(3*(3)^2)/2 = sqrt(27)/2 = (3*sqrt(3))/2 ≈ 2.598. But in our case, the volume is 23, which is less, so the box isn't a cube, so x, y, z must be different.

Hmm, so the minimal x² + y² + z² might not be achieved when x=y=z. So, perhaps the minimal is achieved when two variables are equal, and the third is different. Let's suppose that x = y ≠ z. Let's see if that works.

Let me set x = y. Then, the surface area equation becomes 2(x² + xz + xz) = 54 => 2x² + 4xz = 54 => x² + 2xz = 27.

The volume equation becomes x² z = 23 => z = 23/(x²).

Substituting into the surface area equation: x² + 2x*(23/(x²)) = 27 => x² + (46/x) = 27.

Multiply both sides by x: x³ + 46 = 27x => x³ -27x +46 =0.

Hmm, solving x³ -27x +46 =0. Let me try to find rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46 =20 ≠0

x=2: 8 -54 +46=0. Oh, x=2 is a root.

So, we can factor (x-2)(x² +2x -23)=0.

Thus, x=2 or x=(-2 ± sqrt(4 +92))/2 = (-2 ± sqrt(96))/2= (-2 ± 4*sqrt(6))/2= -1 ± 2*sqrt(6). Since x must be positive, x=2 or x=-1 + 2√6 ≈-1 +4.898≈3.898.

Wait, x=2 is a root, so let's check that.

So, when x=2, then z=23/(x²)=23/4=5.75.

So, the dimensions would be x=y=2, z=5.75.

Now, let's compute x² + y² + z² = 4 +4 + (5.75
