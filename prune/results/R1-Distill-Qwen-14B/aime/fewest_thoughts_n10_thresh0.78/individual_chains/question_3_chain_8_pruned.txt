Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about Jen entering a lottery. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. So S has 10 numbers in total. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the four chosen randomly.

The problem is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention that this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime positive integers, and we need to find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this context, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, P(A|B) is the probability of winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize.

Since winning the grand prize automatically means she has won a prize (because if all four numbers match, then certainly at least two do), A is a subset of B. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, the formula simplifies to P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to find P(A) and P(B), the probabilities of winning the grand prize and of winning a prize, respectively.

First, let's figure out the total number of possible ways to choose the 4 numbers from S. Since S has 10 numbers, the number of possible combinations is C(10,4). C(n,k) is the combination formula, n choose k, which is n!/(k!(n - k)!).

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 210. So, there are 210 possible sets of 4 numbers.

Now, for P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. This is the probability that all four numbers Jen picked are the same as the four chosen randomly. Since Jen has already chosen 4 specific numbers, there's only one specific combination that results in her winning the grand prize. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1, and the total possible is 210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Now, let's move on to P(B), the probability of winning a prize. Winning a prize means that at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, this includes scenarios where exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 of her numbers are chosen. We already know that exactly 4 is the grand prize case, which we've already considered in P(A). But for P(B), we need to include all cases where two or more numbers match.

Alternatively, it's sometimes easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and subtract from 1. The complementary event of winning a prize is not winning a prize, which would be when fewer than two numbers match, i.e., zero or one of her numbers are chosen. So, P(B) = 1 - P(not winning a prize).

Let me compute P(not winning a prize). That's the probability that zero or one of her numbers are in the randomly chosen four.

First, let's compute the number of ways to choose four numbers such that none of them are in Jen's four numbers. Since Jen has four numbers, the remaining numbers are 10 - 4 = 6. So, the number of ways to choose four numbers from these 6 is C(6,4).

C(6,4) is 15. So, there are 15 combinations where none of her numbers are chosen.

Next, the number of ways to choose four numbers where exactly one of them is among Jen's four. So, we choose 1 number from her 4, and 3 numbers from the remaining 6. The number of ways is C(4,1) * C(6,3).

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80 ways.

So, the total number of ways where she doesn't win a prize (i.e., zero or one match) is 15 + 80 = 95.

Therefore, the number of ways she does win a prize is total combinations minus not winning combinations: 210 - 95 = 115.

Therefore, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Alternatively, I could have computed it directly by adding the number of ways where exactly 2, 3, or 4 of her numbers are chosen. Let me verify that to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Number of ways to choose exactly 2: C(4,2) * C(6,2). C(4,2) is 6, C(6,2) is 15. So, 6 * 15 = 90.

Exactly 3: C(4,3) * C(6,1). C(4,3) is 4, C(6,1) is 6. So, 4 * 6 = 24.

Exactly 4: C(4,4) * C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

Adding these together: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. Yep, same as before. So, P(B) = 115/210.

Now, going back to the conditional probability formula: P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. So, the probability is 1/115.

But let me double-check. P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 115/210. So, when you
