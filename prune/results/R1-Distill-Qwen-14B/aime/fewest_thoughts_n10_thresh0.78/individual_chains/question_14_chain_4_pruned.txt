Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, when N is divided by 1000, Q is the quotient and R is the remainder. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, okay. So N is a four-digit number, meaning it's between 1000 and 9999. And it's the greatest such number with this particular property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. 

So, for example, if N is ABCD, then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. 

Our goal is to find the largest such N, and then compute Q + R where Q is N // 1000 (integer division) and R is N % 1000 (remainder).

Alright, so first, I need to find N. Let's think about how to approach this.

Given that N is the largest four-digit number, I should start from 9999 and go downwards, checking each number to see if it satisfies the property. But that sounds time-consuming, so maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem mathematically. Let's denote N as the four-digit number ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A being from 1 to 9 and B, C, D from 0 to 9.

When we change any one digit to 1, the resulting number must be divisible by 7. So, four different numbers: 1BCD, A1CD, AB1D, ABC1, each divisible by 7.

Wait, but N itself doesn't have to be divisible by 7? Or does it? Because the problem doesn't specify that N is divisible by 7, only that changing any digit to 1 makes it divisible by 7.

So, N itself could be any number, but changing any digit to 1 results in a multiple of 7.

Hmm, so perhaps I can write equations based on the divisibility rules.

Let me denote N as 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D.

Then, when we change A to 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100*B + 10*C + D. Let me call this N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

Similarly, changing B to 1 gives N2 = 1000*A + 100*1 + 10*C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.

Changing C to 1 gives N3 = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D.

Changing D to 1 gives N4 = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + 1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1.

Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7. So, N1 ≡ 0 mod7, N2 ≡ 0 mod7, N3 ≡ 0 mod7, N4 ≡ 0 mod7.

So, we can write:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod7

Let me compute each of these modulo7.

First, calculate what 1000, 100, 10, and 1 are modulo7.

Because 7 is a small number, this should be manageable.

1000 divided by 7: 7*142=994, so 1000-994=6. So, 1000 ≡6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 divided by7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2. So, 100≡2 mod7.

10 divided by7 is 1 with remainder3, so 10≡3 mod7.

1 is 1 mod7.

So, let's rewrite each condition:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡0 mod7
   => 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7

2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡0 mod7
   => 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7

3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡0 mod7
   => 6A + 2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7

4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡0 mod7
   => 6A + 2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7

So now, we have four congruencies:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7 ...(i)
2. 6A +2 +3C + D ≡0 mod7 ...(ii)
3. 6A +2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7 ...(iii)
4. 6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7 ...(iv)

Hmm, that's a system of four equations with variables A, B, C, D. All digits, with A from 1-9, B, C, D from 0-9.

Our goal is to find the largest possible N, so we can try to maximize A first, then B, then C, then D.

But solving this system might be a bit tricky. Let me see if I can subtract some equations to find relations between variables.

Looking at equations (i) and (ii):

Equation (i): 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7

Equation (ii): 6A +2 +3C + D ≡0 mod7

Subtract (i) - (ii):

(6 + 2B +3C + D) - (6A +2 +3C + D) ≡0-0 mod7

Simplify: 6 - 6A + 2B -2 ≡0 mod7

Which is: (6 - 2) -6A +2B ≡0 mod7 => 4 -6A +2B ≡0 mod7

Let me write this as: (-6A + 2B) ≡ -4 mod7 => -6A + 2B ≡3 mod7 (since -4 ≡3 mod7)

We can write this as: 2B -6A ≡3 mod7 ...(v)

Similarly, let me take equations (ii) and (iii):

Equation (ii): 6A +2 +3C + D ≡0 mod7

Equation (iii): 6A +2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7

Subtract (iii)-(ii):

(6A +2B +3 + D) - (6A +2 +3C + D) ≡0-0 mod7

Simplify: 2B -2 +3 -3C ≡0 mod7 => 2B -3C +1 ≡0 mod7

Which is: 2B -3C ≡-1 mod7 => 2B -3C ≡6 mod7 ...(vi)

Now, let's take equations (iii) and (iv):

Equation (iii): 6A +2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7

Equation (iv):6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7

Subtract (iv)-(iii):

(6A +2B +3C +1) - (6A +2B +3 + D) ≡0-0 mod7

Simplify: 3C - D -2 ≡0 mod7 => 3C - D ≡2 mod7 ...(vii)

Also, equations (i) and (iv):

Equation (i):6 +2B +3C + D ≡0 mod7

Equation (iv):6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7

Subtract (iv)-(i):

(6A +2B +3C +1) - (6 +2B +3C + D) ≡0-0 mod7

Simplify:6A -6 +1 - D ≡0 mod7 =>6(A -1) - D +1 ≡0 mod7

Which is:6(A -1) - D ≡-1 mod7 =>6(A -1) - D ≡6 mod7 (since -1 ≡6 mod7)

So, 6(A -1) - D ≡6 mod7 ...(viii)

Hmm, okay. So now, from these, we have equations (v), (vi), (vii), (viii):

(v): 2B -6A ≡3 mod7

(vi):2B -3C ≡6 mod7

(vii):3C - D ≡2 mod7

(viii):6(A-1) - D ≡6 mod7

Let me try to solve these step by step.

First, equation (v): 2B -6A ≡3 mod7.

Let me factor 2B -6A: 2(B -3A) ≡3 mod7.

So, 2(B -3A) ≡3 mod7.

Multiplying both sides by the inverse of 2 mod7. Since 2*4=8≡1 mod7, so inverse of 2 is 4.

Thus, (B -3A) ≡3*4 mod7 => (B -3A) ≡12 mod7 =>12-7=5, so (B -3A) ≡5 mod7.

So, B ≡3A +5 mod7. Equation (v) simplifies to B ≡3A +5 mod7.

Similarly, equation (vi):2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

Again, let's write this as 2B ≡3C +6 mod7.

We can rearrange: 2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

Also, from equation (v), we have B ≡3A +5 mod7.

So, let's substitute B into equation (vi).

So, 2*(3A +5) -3C ≡6 mod7.

Compute: 6A +10 -3C ≡6 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3, so 6A +3 -3C ≡6 mod7.

Subtract 3 from both sides:6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3, since 3 and 7 are coprime. Let's see:

6A -3C ≡3 mod7 => 3*(2A - C) ≡3 mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 3 mod7. 3*5=15≡1 mod7, so inverse is 5.

Thus, 2A - C ≡3*5 mod7 => 2A -C ≡15 mod7 =>15-14=1, so 2A -C ≡1 mod7.

So, 2A - C ≡1 mod7. Let's write this as C ≡2A -1 mod7. Equation (vi) gives us C ≡2A -1 mod7.

Moving on to equation (viii):6(A-1) - D ≡6 mod7.

Let's compute 6(A-1) - D ≡6 mod7.

6(A-1) =6A -6. So, 6A -6 - D ≡6 mod7.

Bring -6 to the other side:6A - D ≡6 +6 mod7 =>6A - D ≡12 mod7. 12 mod7 is 5, so 6A - D ≡5 mod7.

So, D ≡6A -5 mod7. Equation (viii) gives D ≡6A -5 mod7.

Now, equation (vii):3C - D ≡2 mod7.

From equation (vii): D ≡3C -2 mod7.

But from equation (viii), D ≡6A -5 mod7. So, equate them:

3C -2 ≡6A -5 mod7.

Bring all terms to one side: 3C -6A +3 ≡0 mod7.

Factor: 3(C -2A +1) ≡0 mod7.

Since 3 and 7 are coprime, we can divide both sides by 3:

C -2A +1 ≡0 mod7 => C ≡2A -1 mod7.

Wait, but this is exactly the same as equation (vi) gives us. So, that's consistent.

So, our equations so far are:

1. B ≡3A +5 mod7 ...(from v)

2. C ≡2A -1 mod7 ...(from vi and vii)

3. D ≡6A -5 mod7 ...(from viii)

So, now, let's summarize:

B = 3A +5 +7k, for some integer k.

But since B is a digit (0-9), let's compute possible B based on A.

Similarly, C = 2A -1 +7m, for integer m.

And D =6
