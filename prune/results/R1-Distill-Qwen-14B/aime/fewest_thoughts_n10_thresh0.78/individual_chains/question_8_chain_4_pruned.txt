Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300, and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It's a linear equation, and the second equation is a bit more complex, involving squares and products. Maybe I can find a way to simplify the second equation using the first one.

Let me write down the second equation again:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I notice that this can be factored. Let me see:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So putting it all together, the equation becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c).

Substituting these into the equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me expand each term:

a²*300 - a³ + b²*300 - b³ + c²*300 - c³ = 6,000,000.

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, this is an interesting equation. I wonder if I can express this in terms of symmetric sums or other known identities.

Let me recall that (a + b + c)^3 expands to a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a). Wait, maybe that's not the exact identity. Let me think again.

Actually, the formula is:

a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ac).

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, I know that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed in terms of other symmetric sums.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c)^2.

Yes, (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So,

a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ac).

Given that a + b + c is 300, this becomes:

a² + b² + c² = 300² - 2(ab + bc + ac) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac).

So, substituting back into the equation I had earlier:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Replace a² + b² + c² with 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac):

300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac)) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Compute 300*90,000: 300*90,000 = 27,000,000.

And 300*2(ab + bc + ac) is 600(ab + bc + ac).

So,

27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ac) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me rearrange this:

-600(ab + bc + ac) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000 - 27,000,000.

So, the right-hand side is -21,000,000.

Multiply both sides by -1:

600(ab + bc + ac) + (a³ + b³ + c³) = 21,000,000.

Hmm, that's still a bit complicated. Maybe I should find a way to express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of ab + bc + ac?

Alternatively, I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ can be written as (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) + 3abc. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.

The correct expansion is:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) - 3abc.

Wait, no, that's not the standard identity. Let me check again.

The standard identity is:

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ac).

So, a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc + (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ac).

But I'm not sure if that helps. Let me see if I can use that.

We know a + b + c = 300, and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac).

So, substituting into the identity:

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc + 300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac) - ab - bc - ac).

Simplify the terms inside the parentheses:

90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac) - ab - bc - ac = 90,000 - 3(ab + bc + ac).

So,

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc + 300*(90,000 - 3(ab + bc + ac)).

Compute 300*90,000: 27,000,000.

300*3(ab + bc + ac) is 900(ab + bc + ac).

So,

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc + 27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ac).

Now, substituting back into the equation I had earlier:

600(ab + bc + ac) + (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 21,000,000.

Replace a^3 + b^3 + c^3 with the expression above:

600(ab + bc + ac) + [3abc + 27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ac)] = 21,000,000.

Simplify:

600(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc + 27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ac) = 21,000,000.

Combine like terms:

(600 - 900)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc + 27,000,000 = 21,000,000.

Which is:

(-300)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc + 27,000,000 = 21,000,000.

Now, subtract 27,000,000 from both sides:

-300(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc = 21,000,000 - 27,000,000.

Which simplifies to:

-300(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc = -6,000,000.

Let me divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

-100(ab + bc + ac) + abc = -2,000,000.

Rearranging:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ac) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, that's an interesting equation. Let me factor out ab, bc, ac:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ac) = -2,000,000.

I can factor ab from the first two terms, but maybe it's better to factor 100:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ac) - 2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ac) - 2,000,000.

Divide both sides by abc (assuming abc ≠ 0, but I should check if any of a, b, c can be zero):

Wait, but if, say, a = 0, then the original equation a + b + c = 300 becomes b + c = 300, and the second equation becomes 0 + 0 + b²*0 + b²c + c²*0 + c²b = 6,000,000. Which simplifies to b²c + c²b = bc(b + c) = 6,
