Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of tokens. The rules are that they take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 are such that Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's break this down. It sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember something about winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, in this case, the players can remove 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. The game starts with n tokens, and Alice goes first. We need to find the values of n where Bob can always win, regardless of Alice's moves. That would mean that for those n, the starting position is a losing position for Alice, making it a winning position for Bob.

Let me try to model this. I'll start by considering small values of n and see what patterns emerge. Maybe I can find a periodicity or a recurring pattern that I can generalize.

Let's list n from 0 upwards and mark whether each position is a winning (W) or losing (L) position for the player whose turn it is.

n = 0: Well, if there are no tokens, the game is over, so the player to move loses. So, n=0 is a losing position. Let's denote this as L.

n = 1: The player can take 1 token and win. So, W.

n = 2: Similarly, the player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent. Wait, but taking 1 leaves n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So, if I take 1, opponent can take 1 and win. Alternatively, can I take 4? No, since 4 > 2. So, the only move is to take 1, leaving n=1 (W for opponent). So, n=2 must be L? Wait, that doesn't make sense because if I take 1 and opponent can take 1 and win, then I lose. So, n=2 is L.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, n=0 is L. n=1: W. For n=2, the player can take 1, leaving 1, which is a W for the opponent. So, the current player cannot force a win, so n=2 is L. Hmm.

n=3: Player can take 1, leaving 2, which is L. So, if I take 1, opponent is left with L, meaning they lose. Therefore, n=3 is W.

n=4: Player can take 1, leaving 3 (W), or take 4, leaving 0 (L). Wait, if they take 4, they win immediately. So, n=4 is W because the player can take all 4 tokens and win.

Wait, no. Wait, the last token wins. So taking 4 tokens when n=4 is allowed and would make the player take the last token, hence winning. So, yes, n=4 is W.

n=5: The player can take 1,
