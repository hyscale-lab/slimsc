Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], given that \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number \( z \) can be expressed in polar form. Since the magnitude of \( z \) is 4, I can write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That might make things easier because working with exponentials can sometimes simplify multiplication and division.

So, substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression, let's see what happens. The first term is \( (75 + 117i)z \), which becomes \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \). The second term is \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \), which since \( |z| = 4 \), \( 1/z \) is \( \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). So that term becomes \( (96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \).

Let me compute each part separately.

First, compute \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \). That would be \( 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \). I can write \( 75 + 117i \) in polar form as well. Let me find its magnitude and angle.

The magnitude is \( \sqrt{75^2 + 117^2} \). Let me calculate that:

75 squared is 5625, and 117 squared is 13689. Adding them gives 5625 + 13689 = 19314. So the magnitude is \( \sqrt{19314} \). Let me compute that. Hmm, 139 squared is 19321, which is a bit more than 19314, so the magnitude is approximately 139, but let me keep it exact for now.

The angle \( \phi_1 \) of \( 75 + 117i \) is \( \tan^{-1}(117/75) \). Let me compute 117/75, which is 1.56. So \( \phi_1 = \tan^{-1}(1.56) \). I can leave it as is for now.

Similarly, \( 96 + 144i \) can be expressed in polar form. Its magnitude is \( \sqrt{96^2 + 144^2} \). Let's compute that:

96 squared is 9216, 144 squared is 20736. Adding them gives 9216 + 20736 = 300,  (Wait: 9216 + 20736: 9216 + 20000 is 29216, plus 736 is 29952. So sqrt(29952). Let me see, 173 squared is 29929, and 174 squared is 30276. So sqrt(29952) is between 173 and 174. Let me see, 173^2 is 29929, so 29952 - 29929 = 23. So sqrt(29952) = 173 + sqrt(23)/173 approximation, but maybe exact value isn't necessary right now. Let me denote this magnitude as \( r_2 = \sqrt{96^2 + 144^2} \), which is \( \sqrt{29952} \).

Its angle \( \phi_2 \) is \( \tan^{-1}(144/96) \). Simplifying 144/96 gives 1.5, so \( \phi_2 = \tan^{-1}(1.5) \).

Now, going back to the expression:

First term: \( 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \) can be written as \( 4r_1 e^{i\phi_1} e^{i\theta} = 4r_1 e^{i(\phi_1 + \theta)} \).

Second term: \( (96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1}{4} r_2 e^{i\phi_2} e^{-i\theta} = \frac{r_2}{4} e^{i(\phi_2 - \theta)} \).

So the entire expression becomes:

\( 4r_1 e^{i(\phi_1 + \theta)} + \frac{r_2}{4} e^{i(\phi_2 - \theta)} \).

We need to find the maximum real part of this expression. The real part of a complex number \( Re(a + ib) = a \), so for each term, the real part is the product of the magnitude and the cosine of the angle.

So the real part of the expression is:

\( 4r_1 \cos(\phi_1 + \theta) + \frac{r_2}{4} \cos(\phi_2 - \theta) \).

That's the expression we need to maximize with respect to \( \theta \).

Wait, but I can simplify this. Let me denote \( \theta \) as a variable, say \( x \), to make the differentiation easier. So, the real part is:

\( 4r_1 \cos(\phi_1 + x) + \frac{r_2}{4} \cos(\phi_2 - x) \).

I need to find the maximum of this function with respect to \( x \).

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to combine these terms or use trigonometric identities to make it easier. Let me think.

Another approach: Instead of using polar form, maybe I can let \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) and write the expression in terms of \( \theta \). Alternatively, perhaps using substitution variables.

Wait a second, maybe I can let \( w = z \) and \( w = 4e^{i\theta} \), so \( \frac{1}{w} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \).

But perhaps another approach: Let me consider the expression \( (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \). Let me denote \( A = 75 + 117i \) and \( B = 96 + 144i \), so the expression becomes \( A z + \frac{B}{z} \).

Given that \( |z| = 4 \), so \( z \overline{z} = |z|^2 = 16 \), so \( \overline{z} = 16 / z \).

Hmm, perhaps we can write the expression in terms of \( z + \overline{z} \), but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, more importantly, the real part of a complex expression \( Re(Az + B/\overline{z}) \) might be expressible in terms of \( z \) and \( \overline{z} \), but given that \( |z|=4 \), \( \overline{z} = 16/z \).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to parameterize \( z \) as \( 4e^{i\theta} \), and then express the entire expression in terms of \( \theta \), then take the real part and maximize with respect to \( \theta \).

Yes, let's go back to that approach.

So, \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), so \( 1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \).

Thus, the expression becomes:

\( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \).

Let me compute each part:

First term: \( 4(75 + 117i) e^{i\theta} \).

Second term: \( \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i) e^{-i\theta} \).

Let me compute the coefficients:

Compute \( 4(75 + 117i) \):

4*75 = 300, 4*117 = 468, so it's 300 + 468i.

Similarly, \( \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i) \):

96/4 = 24, 144/4 = 36, so it's 24 + 36i.

So the expression becomes:

\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

Now, let's write each term in terms of cosine and sine. Remember that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So, expanding each term:

First term: \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \).

Multiply this out:

= 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ

= 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ (since i^2 = -1)

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ

Imaginary: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ

Second term: \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \).

Multiply this out:

= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ

= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ (since i^2 = -1)

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

Imaginary: -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ

Now, adding the two terms together:

Real parts: (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 +24) cosθ + (-468 +36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Imaginary parts: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ +36 cosθ) = (300 -24) sinθ + (468 +36) cosθ = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ

So the entire expression is:

(324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + i(276 sinθ + 504 cosθ)

But the problem asks for the real part of this expression. So the real part is:

324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

We need to find the maximum value of this expression over all real θ.

So, the problem reduces to maximizing \( 324 \cosθ - 432 \sinθ \).

This is a standard trigonometric optimization problem. The maximum of \( A \cosθ + B \sinθ \) is \( \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \).

Wait, but in this case, it's \( A cosθ + B sinθ \), but in our case, it's 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which is like A = 324, B = -432.

So, the maximum value is \( \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Let me compute that.

First, 324 squared: 324 * 324. Let me compute 300^2 = 90000, 24^2=576, and 2*300*24=14400. So (300+24)^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 = 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: 400^2 = 160,000, 32^2 = 1024, and 2*400*32=25,600. So (400+32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 = 185,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

But since B is -432, when we square it, it's positive 432^2 = 186,624.

So the sum is 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

The square root of 291,600 is let's see, since 540^2 = 291,600 (because 500^2=250,000, 40^2=1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000; so (500+40)^2=540^2=500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2=250,000 + 40,000 +1,600=291,600). So sqrt(291,600) = 540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.

The real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which can be written as R cos(θ + φ), where R is sqrt(324^2 +432^2). Because when you have A cosθ + B sinθ, the amplitude is sqrt(A^2 + B^2). But in this case, it's 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which is A cosθ + B sinθ with A=324, B=-432. So the maximum value is indeed sqrt(324^2 +432^2)=540.

So the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but let me think again about the initial expression.

Wait, the original expression was:

(75 + 117i) z + (96 + 144i)/z, with |z|=4.

I converted z to 4e^{iθ}, and after expanding, I got the real part as 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which I maximized.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.

Let me re-examine the calculations.

First, let me recompute the expansion step by step.

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)

= 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ

= 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ -468 sinθ

Real part: 300 cosθ -468 sinθ

Imaginary part: 300 sinθ +468 cosθ

Second term: (24 +36i)(cosθ -i sinθ)

= 24 cosθ -24i sinθ + 36i cosθ -36i^2 sinθ

= 24 cosθ -24i sinθ +36i cosθ +36 sinθ

Real part: 24 cosθ +36 sinθ

Imaginary part: (-24 sinθ +36 cosθ)

Adding the two real parts:

300 cosθ -468 sinθ +24 cosθ +36 sinθ = (300 +24) cosθ + (-468 +36) sinθ = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ

Yes, that seems correct.

Imaginary parts:

300 sinθ +468 cosθ -24 sinθ +36 cosθ = (300-24) sinθ + (468 +36) cosθ = 276 sinθ +504 cosθ.

Yes, that's correct.

So the real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, and the maximum is indeed sqrt(324^2 +432^2).

Wait, let me compute sqrt(324^2 +432^2) correctly.

324 is equal to 4*81, which is 4*9^2. 432 is equal to 4*108, which is 4*36*3, so 432 = 4*108 = 4* (12*9) = 48*9.

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor out common terms.

324 = 324, 432 = 432.

Let me see if they have a common factor. 324 ÷ 108 = 3, 43
