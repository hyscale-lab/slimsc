Okay, let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. It's a conditional probability problem. So, the formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize automatically means she has at least two numbers correct, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, the formula simplifies to P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, first, I need to calculate P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. Then, calculate P(B), the probability of winning any prize (at least two numbers correct). Finally, divide P(A) by P(B) and simplify the fraction.

Let's start with P(A). The probability that Jen wins the grand prize is the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4). The number of favorable outcomes is just 1 because there's only one specific set of four numbers that she picked. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Next, let's find P(B), the probability of winning a prize, which is having at least two numbers correct. This can be calculated by considering all possible ways she can have 2, 3, or 4 numbers matching. So, P(B) is the sum of the probabilities of having exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 correct numbers.

So, P(B) = P(2 correct) + P(3 correct) + P(4 correct). We already know P(4 correct) is 1/210.

Let's compute P(2 correct). The number of ways to choose exactly 2 correct numbers from her 4 is C(4,2), and then the remaining 2 numbers must be chosen from the 6 numbers she didn't pick. So, that's C(6,2). Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is C(4,2) * C(6,2). The probability is then [C(4,2) * C(6,2)] / C(10,4).

Calculating C(4,2) = 6 and C(6,2) = 15. So, 6*15=90. So, P(2 correct) = 90 / 210.

Wait, let me make sure. C(4,2) is 6, correct. Then, for the other two numbers, since she's picking 4 numbers, the remaining 6 numbers are the ones not in her set. So, from 6, choose 2, which is 15. So yes, 6*15=90. So, 90/210.

Similarly, P(3 correct): number of ways is C(4,3)*C(6,1). C(4,3) is 4, and C(6,1) is 6. So, 4*6=24. So, P(3 correct)=24/210.

And we have P(4 correct)=1/210.

Adding them up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. So, P(B) is 115/210.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because 90+24+1=115, but 115/210 is less than 1. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, 90 (for 2 correct) +24 (for 3 correct) +1 (for 4 correct) =115. So, yes, 115/210.

But wait, 115 is a numerator, and 210 is the denominator. Let me check if this simplifies. 115 and 210 share a common factor of 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, P(B)=23/42.

Wait, but 23 is a prime number. So, 23/42 is in simplest terms. So, the probability of winning a prize is 23/42.

Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct?

Wait, another way to compute P(B) is to subtract the probabilities of having fewer than 2 correct numbers from 1. So, P(B) =1 - P(0 correct) - P(1 correct).

Let me compute P(0 correct), which is the probability that none of her numbers are chosen. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 6 she didn't pick. So, C(6,4). So, the number of favorable outcomes is C(6,4). C(6,4)=15. So, P(0 correct)=15/210=1/14.

Similarly, P(1 correct): number of ways is C(4,1)*C(6,3). C(4,1)=4, C(6,3)=20. So, 4*20=80. So, P(1 correct)=80/210=8/21.

So, P(B)=1 - 15/210 -80/210. Let's compute that.

15 +80=95. So, 1 -95/210 = (210 -95)/210=115/210=23/42. So, same as before. So, P(B)=23/42. So that seems correct.

Now, P(A)=1/210. So, the conditional probability P(A|B)= (1/210)/(23/42) = (1/210)*(42/23)= (42)/(210*23)= (1/5)*(1/23)=1/115.

Wait, let me compute it step by step:

(1/210)
