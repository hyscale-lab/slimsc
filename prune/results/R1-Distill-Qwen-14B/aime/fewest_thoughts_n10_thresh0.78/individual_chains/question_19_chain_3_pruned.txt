Okay, let's see. I have a geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem states that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC, which is AB·AC.

Hmm, let me recall some properties of triangle centers and related formulas. The circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6. I know that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, so plugging in the values, OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 -12) =13*1=13. So OI is sqrt(13). Hmm, that's useful.

Also, the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So the incenter I is such that IA is perpendicular to the line segment OI. That must form some right angles in the triangle.

I remember that in triangle ABC, the inradius r is related to the area and semiperimeter. Specifically, r = area / s, where s is the semiperimeter. The area can also be expressed as (a+b+c)/2 * r. Wait, so area = r*s.

Also, the circumradius R is related to the sides by the formula:

R = (a*b*c) / (4*area)

But I'm not sure how that connects yet.

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe I can use some coordinate geometry? Let me try setting up a coordinate system where O is at the origin, and I is somewhere along a coordinate axis. Because IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps I can place I along the x-axis, so that OI is along the x-axis, and IA is vertical?

Wait, let me think. If OI is along the x-axis, then IA must be along the y-axis because it's perpendicular. So point I is at (h, 0), and O is at (0,0). Then point A would be somewhere such that IA is vertical, so the line IA is along the y-axis. So point A would be at (h, k). Hmm, but then O is at (0,0), I at (h,0), and A at (h,k). Then the vector IA is (0, k), and OI is (h,0). The dot product of IA and OI would be 0*h + k*0=0, which satisfies the perpendicular condition. So that's a good setup.

So in this coordinate system, O is (0,0), I is (h, 0), A is (h, k). Now, since O is the circumcenter, all the vertices A, B, C lie on the circumcircle of radius 13. So OA = OB = OC = 13.

So point A is (h, k), so OA² = h² + k² = 13² = 169.

Also, the inradius is 6, so r = 6. The inradius is also the distance from the incenter I to each side. In this coordinate system, since I is (h,0), and A is (h,k), which is on the y-axis over I, then the inradius is the distance from I to BC, which is 6. But I need to relate this to the sides of the triangle.

Wait, maybe I can use the formula that relates R, r, and the distance OI. I just did that earlier, which gave OI² =13.

Another thought: in any triangle, the coordinates of the incenter can be found using the formula:

I = (a*A + b*B + c*C)/(a+b+c)

But that might get complicated with coordinates. Maybe there's another approach.

Alternatively, since I is the inradius, maybe I can express some distances or use trigonometric identities. Hmm.

Wait, there's a formula that connects R, r, and the distance OI. I used that already, but perhaps I can use another formula that relates these to the sides of the triangle.

I recall that in any triangle, the distance between O and I is sqrt(R(R - 2r)), which in this case is sqrt(13*(13-12)) = sqrt(13). So OI = sqrt(13).

Also, given that IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe I can find the length of IA. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, which is of length sqrt(13). So the triangle formed by points O, I, and A is a right triangle at I. So OA² = OI² + IA².

We know OA is 13, OI is sqrt(13), so 13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA².

Which gives 169 = 13 + IA², so IA² = 156, so IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Hmm, okay.

Now, IA is the length from the inradius to vertex A. In a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be found using the formula:

IA = √(r² + (s - a)²)

Where s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite to vertex A.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. For the inradius, the distance from I to a vertex can be given by IA = √(r² + (s - a)^2). I think that's right because in the ex-central triangle or something like that. Alternatively, maybe it's IA = √(r² + (s - a)^2). Or perhaps it's related to the formula involving the angles.

Wait, another approach: in triangle ABC, with inradius r, the distance IA can be expressed as:

IA = r / sin(A/2)

Similarly, IB = r / sin(B/2), IC = r / sin(C/2).

Is that correct? Let me recall. Yes, in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex is given by IA = r / sin(A/2). So, IA = 6 / sin(A/2). From earlier, we found IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). So,

6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39)

So, sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = (3*sqrt(39)) / 39 = sqrt(39)/13.

Wait, let's compute that:

sqrt(39) is approximately 6.245, so sqrt(39)/13 is about 0.48. That's a valid sine value.

So sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

Therefore, cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.

Hmm, okay.

Now, another formula involving R, r, and angles. I think there's a relationship between R, r, and the angles. For example, in a triangle, r = 4R sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2). Let me verify that.

Yes, the formula is r = 4R sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2).

Given that, let's plug in the known values.

r =6, R=13.

So 6 = 4*13* sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2)

Which simplifies to:

6 = 52 * sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2)

So sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2) = 6/52 = 3/26.

We already know sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, so let's plug that in.

(sqrt(39)/13) * sin(B/2) sin(C/2) = 3/26

Simplify:

sin(B/2) sin(C/2) = (3/26) / (sqrt(39)/13) = (3/26) * (13/sqrt(39)) = (3/2) * (1/sqrt(39)) = 3/(2*sqrt(39)).

Hmm, perhaps rationalizing the denominator:

3/(2*sqrt(39)) = (3*sqrt(39))/(2*39) )= sqrt(39)/(26).

So sin(B/2) sin(C/2) = sqrt(39)/26.

Hmm, interesting. Now, perhaps I can relate this to other parts of the triangle.

I also know that in triangle ABC, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2, and area = r*s = 6s.

Also, area = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.

So, 6s = (a*b*c)/52, so a*b*c = 6s*52 = 312s.

Hmm, not sure if that helps yet.

Wait, we're supposed to find AB · AC. AB is side c, AC is side b. So we need to find b*c.

Let me recall that in triangle ABC,

tan(A/2) = r / (s - a)

But I also know that tan(A/2) = sin(A/2)/cos(A/2) = (sqrt(39)/13) / (sqrt(130)/13) )= sqrt(39)/sqrt(130) = sqrt(39/130) = sqrt(3/10).

Wait, sqrt(39/130) simplifies as sqrt(39)/sqrt(130) = sqrt(3*13)/sqrt(10*13) )= sqrt(3)/sqrt(10) = sqrt(3/10).

So tan(A/2) = sqrt(3/10). Hmm.

Alternatively, from tan(A/2) = r/(s - a), which we can write as:

sqrt(3/10) = 6 / (s - a)

So, s - a = 6 / sqrt(3/10) ) = 6 * sqrt(10/3) = 6 * sqrt(10)/sqrt(3) = 2*sqrt(30).

Wait, so s - a = 2*sqrt(30).

But s is the semiperimeter. Let me note that.

So s - a = 2*sqrt(30).

Similarly, in triangle ABC, s = (a + b + c)/2.

So, a = s - 2*sqrt(30).

But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can express the sides in terms of the angles.

Wait, since we have R = 13, by the law of sines, a = 2R sin A = 26 sin A.

Similarly, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.

So, the sides are directly proportional to the sines of the angles. So, AB = c = 26 sin C, AC = b = 26 sin B, and BC = a =26 sin A.

Since we need to find AB · AC = b * c = (26 sin B)(26 sin C) = 676 sin B sin C.

So, if I can find sin B sin C, then I can find AB · AC.

Hmm, let's see. We have from earlier sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, and we found sin(B/2) sin(C/2) = sqrt(39)/26.

Also, from the formula, we had r =4R sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2), which we used earlier.

But perhaps I can find expressions for sin B and sin C in terms of sin(B/2) and sin(C/2).

I recall that sin B = 2 sin(B/2) cos(B/2), similarly for sin C.

So, sin B sin C = [2 sin(B/2) cos(B/2)] [2 sin(C/2) cos(C/2)] = 4 sin(B/2) sin(C/2) cos(B/2) cos(C/2).

We know that sin(B/2) sin(C/2) = sqrt(39)/26.

So, sin B sin C = 4*(sqrt(39)/26)*cos(B/2) cos(C/2).

Hmm, so we need to find cos(B/2) cos(C/2).

Wait, from the formula, we have that cos(B/2) cos(C/2) = ?

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity:

cos(B/2) cos(C/2) = [cos((B
