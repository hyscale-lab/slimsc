Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The special property of N is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once I find N, I need to find Q and R where Q is the quotient when N is divided by 1000, and R is the remainder. Finally, I have to compute Q + R.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the greatest such number, so I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find one that meets the condition.

The condition is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So, for each digit in N, if I replace it with 1, the new number must be divisible by 7. That means, for each of the four digits, there are four different numbers I can form, each of which must be a multiple of 7.

Wait, but how do I ensure that? Maybe I can think about the original number N modulo 7. If changing a digit to 1 affects the number in such a way that it becomes 0 modulo 7, then N must satisfy certain conditions based on each digit's position.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are digits from 0 to 9, and A is not zero. So, N can be expressed as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

When we change any digit to 1, we get a new number. Let's see how that affects N modulo 7.

For example, if I change A to 1, the new number becomes 1BCD, which is 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D. The original number was 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, the difference between the new number and the original number is (1000 - 1000A). Therefore, the new number modulo 7 is (N - 1000(A - 1)) modulo 7. Wait, but since the new number is divisible by 7, that means N - 1000(A - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, if I change B to 1, the new number is A1CD, which is 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D. The difference from N is (100 - 100B), so N - (100 - 100B) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, changing C to 1 gives ABD1, which is 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D. The difference is (10 - 10C), so N - (10 - 10C) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Changing D to 1 gives ABC1, which is 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. The difference is (1 - D), so N - (1 - D) ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, for each digit change, we can write an equation:

1. N - 1000(A - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7
2. N - 100(1 - B) ≡ 0 mod 7
3. N - 10(1 - C) ≡ 0 mod 7
4. N - (1 - D) ≡ 0 mod 7

Wait, no. Let me correct that.

When changing a digit, the difference is the new digit minus the original digit multiplied by the place value.

So, for changing A to 1: new number is 1BCD, which is 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D. The original number N is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, the difference is (1000*1 - 1000*A) = 1000*(1 - A). So, the new number is N - 1000*(A - 1). Since the new number is
