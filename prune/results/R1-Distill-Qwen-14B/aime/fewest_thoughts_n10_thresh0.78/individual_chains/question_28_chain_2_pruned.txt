Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron problem. Let me try to visualize it. It says that ABCD is a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. Specifically, AB equals CD as sqrt(41), AC equals BD as sqrt(80), and BC equals AD as sqrt(89). Interesting. So, it seems like the tetrahedron is symmetric in some way because all opposite edges are equal. That probably means it's a kind of "balanced" tetrahedron, maybe even isohedral or something? Not sure about the exact term, but it's definitely symmetric.

The problem is asking about a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. That point is called the incenter, right? So, similar to the incenter of a triangle, which is equidistant from all sides. In a tetrahedron, the incenter is equidistant from all four faces, and that distance is the inradius.

So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron. The formula for the inradius (r) in a tetrahedron is given by the volume (V) divided by the sum of the areas of the four faces (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4) divided by 3. Wait, no, actually, the formula is r = 3V / S, where S is the total surface area. Let me confirm that.

Yes, in 3D, the inradius is the volume divided by the "surface area," but adjusted because volume is three-dimensional. So, the formula is r = 3V / S, where S is the sum of the areas of all the faces. So, I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area.

But first, how do I find the volume of this tetrahedron? Since all opposite edges are equal, it's a special tetrahedron. I've heard of such tetrahedrons being called "equifacial" or "isohedral," but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it might be a disphenoid, which is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. That seems to fit here because all pairs of opposite edges are equal.

So, if it's a disphenoid, there's a formula for the volume. Let me recall. For a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated if we know the lengths of the edges. Since opposite edges are equal, the volume can be found using the formula:

V = (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) )) / (6 * sqrt(2))

Wait, no, maybe that's not the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula involving the edges. Let me think.

Another approach: maybe I can assign coordinates to the vertices and compute the volume using the scalar triple product. That might be more straightforward, even though it's a bit more involved.

So, let's try that. Let me place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system such that calculations are easier.

Since it's a symmetric tetrahedron, perhaps I can choose coordinates that reflect that symmetry. Let me denote the points as follows:

Let me set point A at (x, y, z), point B at (-x, -y, z), point C at (-x, y, -z), and point D at (x, -y, -z). That way, the points are symmetric with respect to the coordinate planes.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me check. So, if I have A at (x,y,z), then B is at (-x,-y,z), which is symmetric across the origin in x and y, but same z. Similarly, C is at (-x,y,-z), which flips x and z, and D is at (x,-y,-z), which flips y and z. Hmm, maybe that's a good symmetric setup.

Now, let's compute the distances between these points. The edges are AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, each with specified lengths.

Wait, the edges given are AB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), BC = sqrt(89). Let me compute the squared distances because that will make the algebra easier.

Compute AB²: distance between A(x,y,z) and B(-x,-y,z).

AB² = (x - (-x))² + (y - (-y))² + (z - z)² = (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 = 4x² + 4y² = 41.

So, 4x² + 4y² = 41. Let's divide both sides by 4: x² + y² = 41/4.

Similarly, compute AC²: distance between A(x,y,z) and C(-x,y,-z).

AC² = (x - (-x))² + (y - y)^2 + (z - (-z))² = (2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2 = 4x² + 4z² = 80.

So, 4x² + 4z² = 80 → x² + z² = 20.

Similarly, compute BC²: distance between B(-x,-y,z) and C(-x,y,-z).

BC² = (-x - (-x))² + (-y - y)^2 + (z - (-z))^2 = 0 + (-2y)^2 + (2z)^2 = 4y² + 4z² = 89.

Thus, 4y² + 4z² = 89 → y² + z² = 89/4.

Now, we have three equations:

1. x² + y² = 41/4 → equation (1)
2. x² + z² = 20 → equation (2)
3. y² + z² = 89/4 → equation (3)

I can solve these equations to find x², y², z².

Let me subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

(x² + y²) - (x² + z²) = (41/4) - 20 → y² - z² = 41/4 - 80/4 = (-39)/4 → equation (4)

Similarly, subtract equation (2) from equation (3):

(y² + z²) - (x² + z²) = (89/4) - 20 → y² - x² = 89/4 - 80/4 = 9/4 → equation (5)

From equation (5): y² = x² + 9/4.

Substitute into equation (4): (x² + 9/4) - z² = -39/4 → x² - z² = -39/4 - 9/4 = -48/4 = -12 → equation (6)

But from equation (2): x² + z² = 20. Let me call that equation (2).

So, equation (6): x² - z² = -12

equation (2): x² + z² = 20

Adding both equations: 2x² = 8 → x² = 4 → x = 2 or x = -2. Since x is a coordinate, we can take x = 2.

Then, from equation (2): 4 + z² = 20 → z² = 16 → z = 4 or z = -4. Let's take z = 4.

From equation (1): 4 + y² = 41/4 → y² = 41/4 - 16/4 = 25/4 → y = 5/2 or y = -5/2. Let's take y = 5/2.

So, we have x = 2, y = 5/2, z = 4.

Thus, the coordinates are:

A: (2, 5/2, 4)

B: (-2, -5/2, 4)

C: (-2, 5/2, -4)

D: (2, -5/2, -4)

Let me confirm the distances.

Compute AB: between A(2,5/2,4) and B(-2,-5/2,4).

Distance: sqrt[(2 - (-2))² + (5/2 - (-5/2))² + (4 - 4)^2] = sqrt[(4)^2 + (5)^2 + 0] = sqrt(16 + 25) = sqrt(41). Correct.

Compute AC: between A(2,5/2,4) and C(-2,5/2,-4).

Distance: sqrt[(2 - (-2))² + (5/2 -5/2)^2 + (4 - (-4))^2] = sqrt[(4)^2 + 0 + (8)^2] = sqrt(16 + 64) = sqrt(80). Correct.

Compute BC: between B(-2,-5/2,4) and C(-2,5/2,-4).

Distance: sqrt[(-2 - (-2))² + (-5/2 -5/2)^2 + (4 - (-4))^2] = sqrt[0 + (-5)^2 + (8)^2] = sqrt(25 + 64) = sqrt(89). Correct.

Okay, so the coordinates are correct.

Now, with the coordinates, I can compute the volume. The volume V of a tetrahedron with vertices at A, B, C, D can be found using the scalar triple product formula:

V = |(AB · (AC × AD))| / 6

But first, I need to define vectors AB, AC, AD.

Wait, but actually, since I have coordinates for all four points, I can use determinant formula for the volume.

Let me write the coordinates:

A: (2, 5/2, 4)

B: (-2, -5/2, 4)

C: (-2, 5/2, -4)

D: (2, -5/2, -4)

One approach is to translate the tetrahedron so that point A is at the origin. So, subtract A from all points.

But actually, it's easier to compute vectors AB, AC, AD from point A.

So, vectors:

AB = B - A = (-2 - 2, -5/2 -5/2, 4 -4) = (-4, -5, 0)

AC = C - A = (-2 - 2, 5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (-4, 0, -8)

AD = D - A = (2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8)

Now, to compute the scalar triple product AB · (AC × AD).

First, compute the cross product AC × AD.

AC = (-4, 0, -8)

AD = (0, -5, -8)

Cross product:

|i   j   k|
|-4   0  -8|
|0   -5  -8|

= i*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)

Compute each component:

i: 0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5) = 0 - 40 = -40

j: - [ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ] = -[32 - 0] = -32

k: (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 = 20

So, AC × AD = (-40, -32, 20)

Now, take the dot product with AB = (-4, -5, 0):

AB · (AC × AD) = (-4)(-40) + (-5)(-32) + (0)(20) = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320

So, the scalar triple product is 320. The absolute value is 320, so the volume is 320 / 6 = 160/3.

Wait, hold on: 320 divided by 6 is 160/3. Yes.

So, V = 160/3.

Alright, that's the volume. Now, I need the total surface area, which is the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces.

So, I need to compute the area of each face and sum them up.

The four faces are ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD.

Wait, but in a tetrahedron, each face is a triangle. Let
