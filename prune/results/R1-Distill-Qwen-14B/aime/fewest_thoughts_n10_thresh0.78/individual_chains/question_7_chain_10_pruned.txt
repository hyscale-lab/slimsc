Okay, so I've got this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50-50 chance. The question is asking for the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer needs to be expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then we have to find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, it's a regular octagon, so it has 8 sides and 8 vertices. Each vertex is independently colored red or blue, each with probability 1/2. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That's our denominator for the probability.

Now, the numerator is the number of colorings where there exists some rotation that maps all blue vertices to the original red positions. Wait, that's a bit tricky. Let me think. So, if I have a coloring, and I rotate it by some multiple of 45 degrees (since 360/8 = 45), then after the rotation, all the blue vertices in the new position should have been red before the rotation. So, does that mean that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of permutations. The rotation corresponds to a permutation of the vertices. So, for each rotation, we can think of it as a permutation σ, and we want that σ maps the set of blue vertices to the set of red vertices. But since the octagon is regular, the rotations can be thought of as cyclic shifts. So, for example, rotating by one position would send vertex 1 to 2, 2 to 3, etc., and 8 to 1.

So, the problem is equivalent to finding colorings where the set of blue vertices is a rotation (cyclic shift) of the set of red vertices. But since the octagon is symmetric, any rotation would map some set to another.

Wait, but the original coloring is fixed, right? So, we have
