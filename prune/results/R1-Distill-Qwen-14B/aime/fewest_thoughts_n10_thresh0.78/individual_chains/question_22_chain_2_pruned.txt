Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. Hmm, let me parse it. The hexagon is convex and equilateral, which means all its sides are equal in length. Also, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. That's interesting. So, opposite sides not only are parallel but also equal in length because it's equilateral.

The problem then says that the triangle, formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Wait, so they're talking about extending AB, CD, and EF to form a triangle. Let me visualize this. In a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, extending these sides would meet at some points, forming a larger triangle outside the hexagon.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, each side has the same length, say 's'. I need to relate this 's' to the given triangle sides of 200, 240, and 300.

I remember that in such hexagons, the triangle formed by extending the sides is related to the hexagon's sides through similar triangles. Maybe each side of the larger triangle is divided proportionally by the hexagon's sides.

Let me think about the properties. If opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as a centrally symmetric figure. So, each pair of opposite sides are not only parallel but also of equal length, which they already are because it's equilateral.

In this case, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, we form a triangle. Since each of these sides is opposite and parallel, their extensions must meet at points that are vertices of this larger triangle.

Let me label the hexagon as A, B, C, D, E, F in order. So, AB is one side, BC is the next, and so on, until FA connects back to A.

Since opposite sides are parallel, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

Wait, no. Wait, in a hexagon, opposite sides would be AB and DE, BC and EF, CD and FA, right? Because each side has an opposite side across the hexagon.

So, AB || DE, BC || EF, CD || FA.

So, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, these are three different sides, each pair of which are opposite but not necessarily all three sides being extended.

Wait, but the problem says the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. So, each of these sides is being extended, and their extensions meet to form a triangle.

Since AB, CD, and EF are not all opposite to each other, but each is opposite to another side. So, AB is opposite DE, CD is opposite FA, and EF is opposite BC.

Hmm, so when we extend AB and CD, their intersection point would be... Let me try to imagine this.

In a convex hexagon, extending AB and CD would meet at a point outside the hexagon. Similarly, extending CD and EF would meet at another point, and extending EF and AB would meet at the third point, forming a triangle.

So, the triangle is formed by the intersection points of the extensions of AB & CD
