Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again:

"Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p²."

Alright, so I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n. Then, for that p, find the smallest m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by p². Hmm.

First, I remember that primes p for which -1 is a quadratic residue modulo p have some properties. Since n⁴ +1 can be written as (n²)^2 +1, so maybe primes where -1 is a quadratic residue? Or perhaps other properties?

Wait, but in this case, we're looking for primes where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So, not just modulo p, but modulo p squared. That might be a bit more involved.

I think I should start by checking small primes one by one to see which is the least prime p where such an n exists.

Let me list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.

Let me check p=2 first. Is there an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4?

n⁴ is always 0 or 1 mod 4, because:

If n is even, say n=2k, then n⁴ = (2k)^4 = 16k^4 ≡ 0 mod 4.

If n is odd, n=2k+1, then n^4 = (2k+1)^4. Let's compute:

(2k+1)^4 = 16k^4 + 32k^3 + 24k^2 + 8k +1.

Modulo 4, all terms except the last are multiples of 4, so it's 1 mod 4.

So, n^4 +1 would be 0+1=1 mod 4 if n is even, and 1+1=2 mod 4 if n is odd. So n^4 +1 is either 1 or 2 mod 4, which means it's never 0 mod 4. So p=2 doesn't work.

Next prime is p=3. Let's see if there exists n where n⁴ +1 ≡ 0 mod 9.

Compute n^4 mod 9 for n=1 to 8 (since 9 is small):

n=1: 1^4=1 mod9 → 1+1=2 mod9 ≠0
n=2: 16 mod9=7 →7+1=8≠0
n=3: 81 mod9=0 →0+1=1≠0
n=4: same as n=1, since 4≡1 mod3, but let me compute 4^4=256. 256/9=28*9=252, 256-252=4 →4 mod9. 4+1=5≠0
n=5: 5^4=625. 625/9: 9*69=621, 625-621=4 →4 mod9. 4+1=5≠0
n=6: 6^4=1296, which is 0 mod9. 0+1=1≠0
n=7: 7≡-2 mod9, so 7^4=(-2)^4=16 mod9=7. 7+1=8≠0
n=8: 8≡-1 mod9, (-1)^4=1 mod9. 1+1=2≠0

So none of n=1 to 8 gives n⁴+1 ≡0 mod9. So p=3 is out.

Next prime: p=5. Check if any n exists where n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod25.

Compute n^4 mod25 for n=1 to 24. Wait, that's a bit tedious, but perhaps patterns can help.

Actually, since 5 is small, maybe there's a pattern. Let me compute n^4 mod25 for n=1 to 5, then n=6 to10, etc., as 25 is 5 squared.

n=1: 1^4=1 →1+1=2≠0
n=2: 16 →16+1=17≠0
n=3: 81 mod25=6 →6+1=7≠0
n=4: 256 mod25=6 →6+1=7≠0
n=5: 0 →0+1=1≠0
n=6: same as n=1 (since 6≡1 mod5, but let me compute 6^4=1296. 1296/25=51*25=1275, 1296-1275=21 →21 mod25. 21+1=22≠0
n=7: 7^4=2401. 2401/25=96*25=2400, 2401-2400=1 →1 mod25. 1+1=2≠0
n=8: 8^4=4096. 4096-25*163=4096-4075=21 →21 mod25. 21+1=22≠0
n=9: 9^4=6561. 6561/25=262*25=6550, 6561-6550=11 →11 mod25. 11+1=12≠0
n=10: 10^4=10000. 10000 mod25=0 →0+1=1≠0
n=11: 11^4=14641. 14641/25=585*25=14625, 14641-14625=16 →16 mod25. 16+1=17≠0
n=12: 12^4=20736. 20736/25=829*25=20725, 20736-20725=11 →11. 11+1=12≠0
n=13: 13^4=28561. 28561-25*1142=28561-28550=11 →11+1=12≠0
n=14: 14^4=38416. 38416 mod25: 38416-25*1536=38416-38400=16 →16. 16+1=17≠0
n=15: 15^4=50625 →0 mod25. 0+1=1≠0
n=16: 16^4=65536. Let's compute 65536/25=2621*25=65525, 65536-65525=11 →11 mod25. 11+1=12≠0
n=17: 17^4=83521. 83521-25*3340=83521-83500=21 →21. 21+1=22≠0
n=18: 18^4=104976. 104976 mod25: 104976 -25*4199=104976 -104975=1 →1. 1+1=2≠0
n=19: 19^4=130321. 130321 mod25: 130321 -25*5212=130321 -130300=21 →21. 21+1=22≠0
n=20: 20^4=160000 →0 mod25. 0+1=1≠0
n=21: 21^4=194481. 194481 mod25: 194481 -25*7779=194481 -194475=6 →6. 6+1=7≠0
n=22: 22^4=234256. 234256 mod25: 234256 -25*9370=234256 -234250=6 →6. 6+1=7≠0
n=23: 23^4=279841. 279841 mod25: 279841 -25*11193=279841 -279825=16 →16. 16+1=17≠0
n=24: 24^4=331776. 331776 mod25: 331776 -25*13271=331776 -331775=1 →1. 1+1=2≠0

So, for p=5, none of n=1 to24 have n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod25. So p=5 is out.

Next prime: p=7. Check if there's n where n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod49.

This might take a while, but maybe we can find a pattern or a smarter way.

First, let me consider n modulo 7. For n^4 ≡ -1 mod7.

Wait, since we're considering mod7, maybe first determine if -1 is a fourth power mod7.

Compute n^4 mod7 for n=1 to6:

n=1: 1
n=2: 16 mod7=2
n=3: 81 mod7= 4 (since 7*11=77, 81-77=4)
n=4: 256 mod7. 7*36=252
