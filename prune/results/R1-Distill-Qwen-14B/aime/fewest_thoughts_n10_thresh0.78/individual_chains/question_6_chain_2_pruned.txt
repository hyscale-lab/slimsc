Okay, so I need to find the number of intersections between the graphs of two equations: 

First equation: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))

Second equation: x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

Hmm, both equations involve compositions of functions f and g, which are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. So I think I need to understand what these functions look like and how they behave. Then, I can figure out what f(sin(2πx)) and g(f(sin(2πx))) look like, and similarly for the other equation.

Let me start by analyzing f(x) and g(x).

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. So, first, let's consider |x|. The absolute value function creates a V-shape graph. Then, subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2 unit. Taking the absolute value of that would reflect any negative part back upwards. So f(x) is a V-shape graph that's been shifted and then reflected if necessary.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Same idea here. Start with |x|, shift down by 1/4, then take absolute value.

I think it would help to sketch or visualize these functions.

For f(x):

- The inner function is |x|. When we subtract 1/2, the graph shifts down. So for x >= 0, it's (x - 1/2), and for x < 0, it's (|x| - 1/2) because |x| is -x when x is negative.

Wait, actually, let's compute it step by step.

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|

So, for |x| >= 1/2, ||x| - 1/2| is |x| - 1/2, since |x| -1/2 is non-negative.

For |x| < 1/2, ||x| - 1/2| is -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.

So, f(x) is a V-shaped graph with the vertex at |x| = 1/2, so at x = 1/2 and x = -1/2. The graph would have two Vs, each opening upwards, with the bottom at 0 when |x| = 1/2.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When |x| >= 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which is a V-shape with slope 1, starting at x=1/2, y=0, going upwards. Similarly, for |x| < 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|, which is an upside-down V with vertex at (0,1/2), connecting to the points at (1/2,0) and (-1/2,0). So overall, f(x) is a diamond-shaped graph with vertices at (0,1/2), (1/2,0), (0,-1/2), (-1/2,0). Wait, no, because when |x| >=1/2, f(x) is |x| - 1/2, which is positive, so f(x) is the same as |x| shifted down by 1/2, but since we take absolute value again, it's the same as | |x| - 1/2 |.

Wait, perhaps it's better to plot it numerically.

At x=0: f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2.

At x=1/2: f(1/2) = |1/2 -1/2| = 0.

At x=1: f(1) = |1 -1/2| = 1/2.

At x=-1/2: same as x=1/2.

So the graph is a diamond (a rhombus) centered at the origin, with vertices at (0,1/2), (1/2,0), (0,-1/2), (-1/2,0). So f(x) is a diamond shape with those four points.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze that.

At x=0: g(0) = |0 - 1/4| = 1/4.

At x=1/4: g(1/4) = |1/4 -1/4| = 0.

At x=1/2: g(1/2) = |1/2 -1/4| = 1/4.

At x=1: g(1) = |1 -1/4| = 3/4.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, actually, for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.

For |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4.

For |x| < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|.

So the graph of g(x) is similar to f(x) but with different vertices.

It's a diamond shape with vertices at (0,1/4), (1/4,0), (0,-1/4), (-1/4,0). So it's a smaller diamond compared to f(x).

Now, the functions f and g are both diamond-shaped, centered at the origin, but with different scales.

So, now, the first equation is y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))).

Second equation is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))).

I need to find the number of points where these two graphs intersect. That is, points (x,y) such that y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))).

So, substitution might be a way. Let me see.

But this seems complicated because it's a system of equations. Maybe I can express y in terms of x from the first equation and substitute into the second, but that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can analyze the possible ranges of these functions and see how they can intersect.

First, let's understand the inner functions.

Let me first compute f(sin(2πx)).

Since sin(2πx) ranges between -1 and 1.

So, f(sin(2πx)) = || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |.

Let me compute this.

Let me denote s = sin(2πx). So s ranges from -1 to 1.

Compute f(s) = ||s| - 1/2|.

So, for |s| >= 1/2, f(s) = |s| - 1/2.

For |s| < 1/2, f(s) = 1/2 - |s|.

So f(s) is a diamond shape as before, but now s is between -1 and 1.

So f(s) will have the same diamond shape, but on the interval from -1 to 1.

Then, g
