Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, alright. Let me try to break this down.

First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. So, no matter which digit I pick in N and change it to 1, the resulting number is a multiple of 7.

Our goal is to find the largest such N, then divide it by 1000 to get Q (the quotient) and R (the remainder), then add Q and R.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since we're dealing with a four-digit number, let's represent it as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Now, the condition is that changing any one digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So for each digit position, changing it to 1 must yield a multiple of 7.

Let me list the four possibilities:

1. Changing A to 1: 1BCD must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing B to 1: A1CD must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing C to 1: AB1D must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing D to 1: ABC1 must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. That gives us four modular conditions.

I think I can model each condition as N with a specific digit changed to 1 is 0 mod 7.

Let me write these out mathematically.

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, perhaps I can express these in terms of N.

Wait, N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, let's see:

1. When A is changed to 1: the new number is N - (1000A - 1000) = N - 1000(A - 1). So, N - 1000(A - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, for B, changing to 1: N - (100B - 100) = N - 100(B - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.

For C, changing to 1: N - (10C - 10) = N - 10(C - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.

For D, changing to 1: N - (D - 1) = N - (D - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, each of these expressions must be 0 modulo 7. So:

1. N - 1000(A - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7
2. N - 100(B - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7
3. N - 10(C - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7
4. N - (D - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

Alternatively, we can write these as:

1. N ≡ 1000(A - 1) mod 7
2. N ≡ 100(B - 1) mod 7
3. N ≡ 10(C - 1) mod 7
4. N ≡ D - 1 mod 7

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to express each modified number as 0 mod 7.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about each modified number.

For the first case: 1BCD = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

So, 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, for the second case: A1CD = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Third case: AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Fourth case: ABC1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Hmm, perhaps I can express each of these in terms of N.

Wait, N is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, let's compute each modified number:

1. 1BCD = (1000 + 100B + 10C + D) = 1000 + (N - 1000A).
   Because N - 1000A = 100B + 10C + D.
   So, 1BCD = 1000 + (N - 1000A).

Similarly, 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ 1000 + (N - 1000A) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Simplify this: (N - 1000A) ≡ -1000 mod 7.

Wait, 1000 mod 7: Let me compute that. 7*142=994, so 1000-994=6 ⇒ 1000 ≡ 6 mod7.

So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod7. Thus, (N - 1000A) ≡ -6 mod7 ⇒ (N - 1000A) ≡ 1 mod7.

Similarly, N ≡ 1000A +1 mod7.

But N is also equal to 1000A + 100B + 10C + D, which we can write as N = 1000A + (100B + 10C + D). So, N ≡ (100B + 10C + D) mod7.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should compute each condition one by one.

Let me compute each modified number mod7 and set them to 0.

First, compute 1000 mod7, 100 mod7, 10 mod7, etc., to simplify.

Compute 1000 mod7: 1000/7 is 142*7=994, so 1000-994=6 ⇒ 1000≡6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7: 100/7=14*7=98, so 100≡2 mod7.

10 mod7=3.

And 1 mod7=1.

So, 1000 ≡6, 100≡2, 10≡3, 1≡1 mod7.

Now, compute each modified number:

1. 1BCD = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

2. A1CD = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡6A +2 +3C + D ≡0 mod7.

3. AB1D = 1000A + 100B +10 + D ≡6A +2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7.

4. ABC1 = 1000A + 100B +10C +1 ≡6A + 2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

Wait, so all four of these expressions must be ≡0 mod7.

So, let me write the four equations:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.
2. 6A +2 +3C + D ≡0 mod7.
3. 6A +2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7.
4. 6A + 2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

Hmm, so we have four equations with variables A, B, C, D (digits, so 0-9, with A≠0).

We need to solve these equations to find A, B, C, D.

But since N is the greatest four-digit number, we want to maximize N, which is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, we should aim for the largest possible A (preferably 9), then the largest B, etc.

But let's see if we can find relations between the equations.

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2.

Equation 2: 6A +2 +3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Equation 1: 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Subtracting 1 from 2: (6A +2 +3C + D) - (6 + 2B +3C + D) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify: 6A +2 -6 -2B ≡0 ⇒6A -2B -4 ≡0 mod7.

Which is 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

We can write this as 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Similarly, let's subtract equation 3 from equation 4.

Equation 4:6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

Equation 3:6A +2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7.

Subtracting 3 from 4: (6A +2B +3C +1) - (6A +2B +3 + D) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify: 3C +1 -3 - D ≡0 ⇒3C - D -2 ≡0 ⇒3C - D ≡2 mod7.

So, 3C - D ≡2 mod7. That's another equation.

Let me note that down.

So far, we have:

From equation 2 - equation1: 6A -2B ≡4 mod7. Let me call this equation 5.

From equation4 - equation3: 3C - D ≡2 mod7. Let's call this equation 6.

Now, let's see if we can find another relation.

Let me subtract equation1 from equation4.

Equation4:6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

Equation1:6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Subtracting 1 from 4: (6A +2B +3C +1) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify: 6A +1 -6 - D ≡0 ⇒6A -5 - D ≡0 ⇒6A - D ≡5 mod7.

So, 6A - D ≡5 mod7. Let's call this equation7.

Similarly, perhaps subtract equation2 from equation3.

Equation3:6A +2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7.

Equation2:6A +2 +3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Subtracting 2 from 3: (6A +2B +3 + D) - (6A +2 +3C + D) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify: 2B +3 -2 -3C ≡0 ⇒2B -3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, 2B -3C ≡-1 mod7 ⇒2B -3C ≡6 mod7. Let's call this equation8.

Now, let me summarize the equations we have:

Equation5: 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Equation6:3C - D ≡2 mod7.

Equation7:6A - D ≡5 mod7.

Equation8:2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

Hmm, perhaps we can express variables in terms of others.

Let me see equation7 and equation6.

From equation7:6A - D ≡5 mod7 ⇒ D ≡6A -5 mod7.

From equation6:3C - D ≡2 mod7 ⇒ D ≡3C -2 mod7.

So, setting these equal: 6A -5 ≡3C -2 mod7.

Simplify:6A -3C ≡3 mod7 ⇒ 2A - C ≡1 mod7 (divided both sides by 3, since 3 and 7 are coprime. 3*5=15≡1 mod7, so multiplying both sides by 5: (6A -3C)*5 ≡3*5 ⇒ (30A -15C) ≡15 mod7 ⇒ 30A≡2A mod7, -15C≡-C mod7. So, 2A - C ≡15 mod7 ⇒15 mod7=1, so 2A - C≡1 mod7.

So, equation9:2A - C ≡1 mod7.

Similarly, equation8:2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

And equation5:6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Let me see if I can express B from equation5.

From equation5:6A -2B ≡4 ⇒2B ≡6A -4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2: B ≡3A -2 mod7.

Because 2*4=8≡1 mod7, so the inverse of 2 mod7 is 4. So, multiply both sides by 4:

B ≡4*(3A -4) mod7 ⇒ B ≡12A -16 mod7.

12 mod7=5, 16 mod7=2. So, B≡5A -2 mod7.

So, equation10: B ≡5A -2 mod7.

Similarly, from equation9:2A - C ≡1 mod7 ⇒ C≡2A -1 mod7.

Equation11: C ≡2A -1 mod7.

Similarly, equation6: D ≡3C -2 mod7.

Using equation11: C=2A -1, so D ≡3*(2A -1) -2 mod7 ⇒6A -3 -2 ⇒6A -5 mod7.

Which is consistent with equation7, which had D ≡6A -5 mod7.

So, all equations are consistent.

So, let's summarize:

A is a digit from 1 to 9.

B ≡5A -2 mod7.

C ≡2A -1 mod7.

D ≡6A -5 mod7.

Since B, C, D are digits (0-9), their values modulo7 must correspond to their actual values.

So, perhaps I can represent each of B, C, D in terms of A.

Let me write:

B = (5A -2) mod7.

Similarly, C = (2A -1) mod7.

D = (6A -5) mod7.

But these are modulo7, so I can express them as:

B = 7k1 + ((5A -2) mod7), for some integer k1 such that B is between 0 and9.

Similarly for C and D.

But since B, C, D are digits (0-9), their values modulo7 can be from 0 to6, but considering their actual values, let's see.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute B, C, D in terms of A, considering the modulo expressions.
