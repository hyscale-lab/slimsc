Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and see what information I have.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. That probably means they lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle, so there's a circle passing through these four points. Interesting, so ADHG is cyclic.

Given lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So BC = AD = 16, and AB = CD = 107. Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, FG = EH = 17, and EF = GH = 184.

Let me try to visualize this. I think drawing a rough sketch might help. So, let's imagine rectangle ABCD with AB being the longer side, 107 units, and BC being the shorter side, 16 units. So ABCD is a tall rectangle.

Now, rectangle EFGH is another rectangle. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So I think E and F are on the line DC. Wait, but D and C are corners of the first rectangle. So DC is one of the sides of ABCD, which is 107 units long.

Wait, but E and F are points on that line DC, but they also belong to the rectangle EFGH. Wait, no, EFGH is a separate rectangle. Let me try to think of the positions.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, maybe E is between D and F, and F is between E and C? Or maybe E is beyond D or beyond C. Hmm, not sure yet.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, points A, D, H, G are concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circle. That might imply that angles at those points have some relationships, perhaps cyclic quadrilateral properties.

I think coordinate geometry might help here. Let me assign coordinates to the points.

Let's place point D at the origin (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, if D is at (0,0), then point C would be at (107, 0) because DC is 107 units. Then, point B would be at (0,16) because AB is 107 and BC is 16. Wait, no, wait. Wait, AB is 107, BC is 16. So if D is at (0,0), then C is at (107,0), and since BC is 16, B would be at (107,16), and A at (0,16).

Wait, that makes sense because ABCD is a rectangle, so AB is vertical with length 16, BC is horizontal with length 107. Wait, no, wait. AB is a side of the rectangle, so if AB is 107, then AB could be either the length or the height. Wait, but in the problem statement, ABCD is a rectangle, so AB and BC are adjacent sides. So, AB is one side, BC is the next. So AB is 107, BC is 16, so the sides are 107 and 16.

So, if I place point D at (0,0), then point C is at (107,0). Point B would then be at (107,16), and point A at (0,16). So, ABCD is arranged such that AB is vertical, BC is horizontal.

Now, the other rectangle is EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, so they lie on the same line. Since D is at (0,0) and C is at (107,0), the line DC is the x-axis from (0,0) to (107,0). So E and F must lie somewhere on this line.

Wait, but E and F are points on the rectangle EFGH. So, let's think about their positions. Let me assign coordinates to E and F. Let's say E is at (e, 0) and F is at (f, 0), lying on the x-axis between D and C, or perhaps extending beyond.

Since EFGH is a rectangle, and E and F are two of its points, the other points G and H must be arranged such that EFGH is a rectangle. So, the sides EF and FG are sides of the rectangle, with EF = 184 and FG = 17.

Wait, but EF is 184, which is much longer than DC which is 107. So if E and F are on DC, which is 107 units long, their distance apart would be 184, which is longer than DC itself. That suggests that E and F must lie on the line DC extended beyond D and C, because otherwise, if they were between D and C, the maximum distance between them would be 107, which is less than 184.

So, perhaps E is to the left of D and F is to the right of C, or vice versa.

But let me think. Let's suppose E is to the left of D and F is to the right of C. So E is at (e, 0) where e < 0, and F is at (f, 0) where f > 107.

Alternatively, maybe E is to the right of C and F to the left of D. But considering EF = 184, which is a considerable length, it's more likely that E and F are on the same line DC but extended beyond the original DC segment.

So, if I take E at (e, 0) and F at (f, 0), then the distance between E and F is |f - e| = 184. So, f - e = 184. But let's see.

Since EFGH is a rectangle, and EF is one of its sides, then FG is perpendicular to EF. So, from F, moving to G, which is up by 17 units. Wait, but the direction depends on the orientation. Alternatively, maybe it's moving in the positive y-direction if the rectangle is above or below the line DC.

But wait, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Point A is at (0,16), D is at (0,0), H and G are points of EFGH. So, if EFGH is a rectangle, then once E and F are placed, G and H can be determined.

Wait, perhaps it's better to assign coordinates to all the points.

So, let's assign:

- D at (0,0)
- C at (107,0)
- B at (107,16)
- A at (0,16)

Now, let E be at (e,0) and F at (f,0) on the line DC. Since EF = 184, the distance between E and F must be 184. So, |f - e| = 184.

Since E and F are both on the x-axis, the rectangle EFGH can be constructed by moving up or down from E and F.

Assuming the rectangle is above the line DC, we can define point G as (f, y) and point H as (e, y), but I need to think about the orientation.

Wait, in a rectangle, consecutive sides are perpendicular. So, from E, moving to F is along the x-axis, then from F, moving perpendicular (so along y-axis) to G, and so on.

So, if EF is the base, then FG would be the vertical side. So, if EF is along the x-axis from E(e,0) to F(f,0), then FG would go upward or downward from F to G(f, y), and similarly from E to H(e, y). So, the rectangle EFGH would have E(e,0), F(f,0), G(f, y), H(e, y), forming a rectangle with length EF = 184 and height FG = 17.

Wait, but in the problem statement, FG is 17, so FG = 17. So, the vertical side is 17 units. So, the rectangle's height is 17.

So, points G and H would be at (f,17) and (e,17) respectively, assuming the rectangle is above DC.

Alternatively, they could be at (f,-17) and (e,-17), but since A is at (0,16), which is above DC, maybe the rectangle is also above, so G and H are at (f,17) and (e,17).

Wait, but then point H would be at (e,17), and point G at (f,17). So, the rectangle EFGH would have coordinates E(e,0), F(f,0), G(f,17), H(e,17).

Now, the problem states that A, D, H, G lie on a circle. A is at (0,16), D is at (0,0), H is at (e,17), and G is at (f,17). So, these four points lie on a circle.

So, I can use the condition that four points lie on a circle, which means that the determinant of the following matrix is zero:

|x   y   x²+y²  1|
|0   0   0+0=0   1|
|0   16  0+256  1|
|e   17  e²+289 1|
|f   17  f²+289 1|

Wait, but that's a 4x4 determinant, which might be a bit complicated. Alternatively, I can use the fact that the power of point relations hold for cyclic quadrilaterals, or perhaps find the equation of the circle passing through three points and see if the fourth lies on it.

Alternatively, perhaps using the property that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the slopes of the diagonals is -1 if they are perpendicular, but that's only for certain cases. Wait, no, that's not a general rule. Alternatively, maybe using the cyclic quadrilateral angle condition: opposite angles sum to 180 degrees, but in coordinate terms, that might be complicated.

Alternatively, I can find the equation of the circle passing through A(0,16), D(0,0), and G(f,17), and then see if H(e,17) lies on the same circle.

Let me proceed step by step.

The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0.

Since point D(0,0) lies on the circle, substituting x=0, y=0 gives 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 → c=0.

So the equation becomes x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy = 0.

Now, point A(0,16) lies on the circle. Substituting x=0, y=16:

0 + 256 + 0 + 2f*16 = 0 → 256 + 32f = 0 → 32f = -256 → f = -8.

So now, the equation is x² + y² + 2gx -16y = 0.

Now, point G(f,17) lies on the circle. Substituting x=f, y=17:

f² + 17² + 2g*f -16*17 = 0 → f² + 289 + 2g f - 272 = 0 → f² + 2g f + 17 = 0.

Similarly, point H(e,17) lies on the circle, so substituting x=e, y=17:

e² + 17² + 2g e -16*17 = 0 → e² + 289 + 2g e - 272 = 0 → e² + 2g e + 17 = 0.

So, both G and H lie on the circle, giving us two equations:

1) f² + 2g f + 17 = 0
2) e² + 2g e + 17 = 0

Hmm, interesting. Let me subtract these two equations:

(f² - e²) + 2g(f - e) = 0

Factor: (f - e)(f + e) + 2g(f - e) = 0 → (f - e)(f + e + 2g) = 0.

Since f ≠ e (because EF is 184, so f - e = 184, which is not zero), then f + e + 2g = 0.

So, f + e + 2g = 0 → equation (3): 2g = -(f + e).

Now, from equation (1): f² + 2g f +17 = 0. Let's substitute 2g from equation (3):

f² + [-(f + e)] * f + 17 = 0 → f² - f(f + e) +17 = 0 → f² - f² - ef +17 = 0 → -ef +17 = 0 → ef = 17.

So, ef = 17. Interesting.

Now, since E and F are points on the line DC, which is the x-axis, and EF = 184, we have f - e = 184 (since E is at (e,0) and F is at (f,0), with f > e).

So, f - e = 184.

We also have ef = 17.

So, we can set up these two equations:

f - e = 184
ef = 17

We can solve for e and f.

Let me let e = x, then f = x + 184.

Substituting into ef = 17: x(x + 184) = 17 → x² + 184x -17 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [-184 ± sqrt(184² + 4*17)] / 2.

Calculating the discriminant: 184² = (180+4)^2 = 180² + 2*180*4 +4² = 32400 + 1440 +16 = 32400+1440=33840, +16=33856.

So sqrt(33856 + 68) = sqrt(33924). Wait, wait, no: because 4*17 is 68, so discriminant is 33856 + 68 = 33924.

What's sqrt(33924)? Let me see. 184^2 is 33856, as we have. 185^2 is 34225, which is larger. So sqrt(33924) is between 184 and 185.

Let me compute 184^2 = 33856, so 33924 -33856 =68. So sqrt(33856 +68) = 184 + 68/(2*184) approximately, but perhaps exact sqrt is better.

Wait, 33924 divided by 4 is 8481, which is 8481. Let me see if 8481 is a perfect square.

Well, 92^2 is 8464, 93^2 is 8649. So 8481 is between 92^2 and 93^2. So 33924 is 4*8481, so sqrt(33924) is 2*sqrt(8481). Hmm, maybe it's a whole number. Wait, let me check.

Wait, 184^2=33856, 184.5^2 would be (184 +0.5)^2 = 184^2 + 2*184*0.5 +0.25= 33856 +184 +0.25= 34040.25, which is more than 33924, so sqrt(33924) is less than 184.5.

Alternatively, perhaps 184.2^2: 184^2=33856, 0.2^2=0.04, 2*184*0.2=73.6, so 184.2^2=33856 +73.6 +0.04= 33929.64, which is more than 33924, so sqrt(33924) ≈184.2 - some.

Hmm, perhaps it's not a whole number, so maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I can factor the quadratic equation x^2 + 184x -17=0.

But 17 is a prime number, so the factors might not be integers. So perhaps the solutions are irrational.

Wait, but maybe I can proceed without knowing the exact values of e and f.

Wait, because the problem asks for CE, which is the distance from C (107,0) to E (e,0), which is |107 - e|.

Wait, yes! Because both are on the x-axis, so CE is just |107 - e|.

So, if I can find e, then CE is |107 - e|.

So, from the quadratic equation, x = [ -184 ± sqrt(184^2 +4*17) ]/2.

Which is x = [ -184 ± sqrt(33856 + 68) ]/2 → [ -184 ± sqrt(33924) ]/2.

But sqrt(33924) = sqrt(4 * 8481) = 2*sqrt(8481).

Wait, 8481 divided by 3 is 2827, which is not a whole number. 8481 divided by 13 is 652.38, not a whole number. Hmm, perhaps it's not a perfect square. So, maybe it's better to express CE in terms of e.

Wait, but perhaps I can find e + f first.

We have f = e + 184.

From equation (3): 2g = -(f + e) → f + e = -2g.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, but since we need CE = |107 - e|, perhaps we can find e without finding f.

But since we have the quadratic equation x^2 +184x -17=0, where x = e, the solutions are:

e = [-184 ± sqrt(184^2 +4*17)] /2 → [-184 ± sqrt(33856 +68)] /2 → [-184 ± sqrt(33924)]/2.

Hmm, but this seems messy. Maybe there's another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the rectangle EFGH and the circle passing through A, D, G, H.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Power of a Point theorem.

Wait, the Power of a Point theorem says that for a point outside a circle, the product of the distances from the point to the intersection points of any line through the point and the circle is equal.

But I'm not sure how that applies here.

Alternatively, since ADHG is cyclic, the power of point E with respect to the circle can be considered, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: since E and F are on the x-axis, and the rectangle EFGH has height 17, points G and H are at (f,17) and (e,17) respectively.

So, the circle passes through A(0,16), D(0,0), G(f,17), and H(e,17). So, these four points lie on the same circle.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the equation of the circle passing through A, D, and G, then check if H lies on it.

Wait, but I already did that earlier, which led to the equations ef =17 and f - e=184.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to find CE in terms of e, knowing that f = e +184 and ef=17.

So, from ef=17 and f=e+184, we have e*(e+184)=17 → e^2 +184e -17=0.

So, solving for e: e = [-184 ± sqrt(184^2 +4*17)] /2 → as before.

But maybe I can compute e numerically, using approximate values.

Compute the discriminant: 184^2=33856, 4*17=68, so sqrt(33856 +68)=sqrt(33924).

Let me compute sqrt(33924).

I know that 184^2=33856, so 184^2=33856.

Let me try 184.2^2: 184 +0.2.

(184 +0.2)^2=184^2 + 2*184*0.2 +0.2^2= 33856 + 73.6 +0.04= 33929.64.

But 33929.64 is more than 33924, so the square root is less than 184.2.

Compute 184.1^2: 184^2 + 2*184*0.1 +0.1^2= 33856 + 36.8 +0.01= 33892.81.

Hmm, 33892.81 is less than 33924.

The difference: 33924 -33892.81=31.19.

So, between 184.1 and 184.2.

Let me try 184.1 + x, where x is small.

Let me model sqrt(33924)=184.1 + x, where x is approximately 31.19/(2*184.1) using linear approximation.

So, x ≈31.19/(2*184.1)=31.19/(368.2)≈0.0847.

So, sqrt(33924)≈184.1 +0.0847≈184.1847.

So, sqrt(33924)≈184.1847.

Thus, e = [ -184 ±184.1847 ] /2.

We can discard the negative root because if e were negative, then f =e+184 would be positive if e is near zero, but let's see:

Taking the positive root:

e = [ -184 +184.1847 ] /2 ≈ (0.1847)/2 ≈0.09235.

Wait, but if e≈0.09235, then f =e +184≈184.09235.

Then, ef ≈0.09235 *184.09235≈17, which is correct.

Alternatively, taking the negative root:

e = [ -184 -184.1847 ] /2 ≈ (-368.1847)/2≈-184.09235.

Then, f =e +184≈-184.09235 +184≈-0.09235.

Then, ef ≈(-184.09235)*(-0.09235)≈17, which also holds.

So, we have two possible solutions:

1) e ≈0.09235, f≈184.09235.

2) e≈-184.09235, f≈-0.09235.

Now, considering the positions of E and F on the line DC.

In our initial setup, DC is from (0,0) to (107,0). So, E and F are either both on DC, or extended beyond.

Case 1: e≈0.09235, f≈184.09235.

So, E is at approximately (0.09235, 0), which is just to the right of D(0,0), and F is at (184.09235,0), which is far to the right, beyond point C(107,0).

Case 2: e≈-184.09235, f≈-0.09235.

So, E is at (-184.09235,0), far to the left of D(0,0), and F is at (-0.09235,0), just to the left of D.

Now, considering the rectangle EFGH, points G and H would be at (f,17) and (e,17) respectively.

In case 1: G is at (184.09235,17), H at (0.09235,17).

In case 2: G is at (-0.09235,17), H at (-184.09235,17).

Now, the circle passes through A(0,16), D(0,0), G, and H.

In case 1: G is at (184.09235,17), which is far to the right, and H is at (0.09235,17), which is near D.

In case 2: G is at (-0.09235,17), which is just left of D, and H is at (-184.09235,17), far to the left.

Now, for the circle to pass through A(0,16), D(0,0), G, and H, let's consider the positions.

In case 1, G is at (184.09235,17), which is quite far from A(0,16) and D(0,0). So the circle would have to encompass these points. Similarly, in case 2, G is near D, and H is far left.

But regardless, let's proceed with both cases to see which one makes sense.

But maybe the problem expects a positive CE length, so let's check both possibilities.

Case 1: e≈0.09235, so CE= |107 - e|≈107 -0.09235≈106.90765.

Case 2: e≈-184.09235, so CE= |107 - (-184.09235)|=107 +184.09235≈291.09235.

Hmm, but the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, in case 1, E is between D and C, but F is beyond C. In case 2, E is far left of D, and F is between D and E. Hmm, but F is to the right of E, so in case 2, F would be at -0.09235, which is between E(-184.09235,0) and D(0,0).

Wait, but in case 2, F is at (-0.09235,0), which is between E(-184.09235,0) and D(0,0). So, D, E, C, F are collinear in the order E, F, D, C? But that would require F to be between E and D, but in the problem statement, it's D, E, C, F collinear. Wait, the problem says "D, E, C, F are collinear." So, the order is D, then E, then C, then F along the line.

Wait, that's an important point. So, the line must have D first, then E, then C, then F.

So, the order is D(0,0), then E, then C(107,0), then F.

So, that implies that E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.

So, in that case, E's x-coordinate e must satisfy 0 < e <107, and F is at e +184, which would be greater than 107, as 184 is much larger than 107.

Wait, but earlier, in case 1, e≈0.09235, which is just after D, and F≈184.09235, which is way beyond C(107,0). So, E is at (0.09235,0), F at (184.09235,0). So, the order on the line would be D(0,0), E(0.09235,0), C(107,0), F(184.09235,0). So that matches the problem statement.

In case 2, E is at (-184.09235,0), F at (-0.09235,0). So, the order would be E, F, D, C. But the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, implying that D comes first, then E, then C, then F. So, case 2 is invalid because F is between E and D, not beyond C.

Therefore, case 1 is the correct scenario.

So, CE=107 - e≈107 -0.09235≈106.90765, which is approximately 106.90765.

But the problem likely expects an exact value, not an approximate decimal.

Wait, earlier, we have e*(e +184)=17, which is e^2 +184e -17=0.

So, e = [-184 + sqrt(184^2 +4*17)] /2 → which is [ -184 + sqrt(33924) ] / 2.

But sqrt(33924) can be expressed as sqrt(4*8481) which is 2*sqrt(8481). So, e= [ -184 + 2*sqrt(8481) ] /2 = (-184/2) + sqrt(8481) → e= -92 + sqrt(8481).

So, CE=107 - e=107 - (-92 + sqrt(8481))=107 +92 - sqrt(8481)=199 - sqrt(8481).

Wait, but let me check that.

Wait, e = [ -184 + sqrt(33924) ] / 2 → sqrt(33924)=sqrt(4*8481)=2*sqrt(8481). So, e= [ -184 + 2*sqrt(8481) ] /2= (-184/2) + (2*sqrt(8481))/2= -92 + sqrt(8481).

So, CE=107 - e=107 - (-92 + sqrt(8481))=107 +92 - sqrt(8481)=199 - sqrt(8481).

Wait, but that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let me recast it.

We have e = [ -184 + sqrt(33924) ] / 2.

So, CE=107 - e=107 - [ (-184 + sqrt(33924)) / 2 ].

Which can be written as 107 + (184 - sqrt(33924))/2.

Which is (214 +184 - sqrt(33924)) /2 → (398 - sqrt(33924))/2.

Wait, but sqrt(33924)=sqrt(4*8481)=2*sqrt(8481). So, 33924=4*8481.

So, sqrt(33924)=2*sqrt(8481).

Thus, CE= [398 -2*sqrt(8481)] /2= 199 - sqrt(8481).

Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, but sqrt(8481) is sqrt(84^2 + something? 84^2=7056, 85^2=7225, 86^2=7396, 90^2=8100, 91^2=8281, 92^2=8464, 93^2=8649.

Wait, 92^2=8464, 93^2=8649. So, 8481 is between 92^2 and 93^2.

Compute 92^2=8464, so 8481-8464=17. So, 8481=92^2 +17.

Hmm, perhaps 8481 is a multiple of some square.

Wait, 8481 divided by 3: 8481 ÷3=2827. 2827 ÷3=942.333, so no. 8481 ÷ 17= 8481/17=500.058..., not an integer. So, perhaps 8481 is 93^2 -168, but that might not help.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to leave it as sqrt(8481).

Wait, but 8481= 93^2 - 168=8649-168=8481. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe 8481=13*652.3846, which doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps 8481= 3*2827, but that also doesn't help.

So, perhaps the exact value of CE is 199 - sqrt(8481). But let me check if 8481 is a perfect square.

Wait, 92^2=8464, as before. 92.1^2= (92 +0.1)^2=92^2 + 2*92*0.1 +0.1^2=8464 +18.4 +0.01=8482.41.

Which is more than 8481. So, 92.1^2=8482.41, which is higher than 8481.

So, sqrt(8481)=92.0 something.

Let me compute 92.0^2=8464.

92.05^2= (92 +0.05)^2=92^2 + 2*92*0.05 +0.05^2=8464 +9.2 +0.0025=8473.2025.

Still less than 8481.

Compute 92.05^2=8473.2025.

92.05 + x)^2=8481.

We can compute x by linear approximation.

Let f(x)= (92.05 +x)^2= 92.05^2 + 2*92.05*x +x^2.

We have f(x)=8481.

So, 8473.2025 + 2*92.05*x ≈8481.

So, 2*92.05*x≈8481 -8473.2025=7.7975.

Thus, x≈7.7975/(2*92.05)=7.7975/184.1≈0.04235.

So, sqrt(8481)≈92.05 +0.04235≈92.09235.

Thus, CE=199 -92.09235≈106.90765, which is consistent with the earlier approximation.

But the problem expects an exact value, so I think the answer is 199 - sqrt(8481).

Wait, but let me double-check the math to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier.

Wait, from the quadratic equation:

e^2 + 184e -17=0.

So, e = [ -184 ± sqrt(184^2 +4*17) ]/2.

Which is [ -184 ± sqrt(33856 +68) ]/2 → sqrt(33924).

So, sqrt(33924)=sqrt(4*8481)=2*sqrt(8481).

Thus, e= [ -184 +2*sqrt(8481) ]/2= -92 + sqrt(8481).

So, CE=107 - e=107 - (-92 + sqrt(8481))=107 +92 - sqrt(8481)=199 - sqrt(8481).

Yes, that seems correct.

But let me check if 8481 is a perfect square again.

Wait, 92^2=8464, 93^2=8649. 8481 is between them. 92.09^2≈(92 +0.09)^2=92^2 + 2*92*0.09 +0.09^2=8464 +16.56 +0.0081≈8480.5681, which is close to 8481. So, sqrt(8481)=92.09 approximately.

But I need to express the answer as an exact integer. Wait, the problem asks for the length of CE, and perhaps the answer is an integer. But according to my calculation, it's 199 - sqrt(8481), which is approximately 106.90765, which is not an integer. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me go back.

Wait, when I computed the equation of the circle passing through A, D, G, and H, I set point G at (f,17) and H at (e,17). But maybe that's incorrect.

Wait, in rectangle EFGH, if EF is the base from E(e,0) to F(f,0), then FG would go upward from F to G(f,17), and similarly from E to H(e,17). So, yes, H is at (e,17) and G at (f,17).

Therefore, the circle passes through A(0,16), D(0,0), G(f,17), H(e,17).

Earlier, I found that ef=17 and f -e=184.

So, from e*(e+184)=17, we have e^2 +184e -17=0.

So, e= [-184 ± sqrt(184^2 +4*17)]/2= [ -184 ± sqrt(33924) ]/2.

Which gives e= (-184 ± 2*sqrt(8481))/2= -92 ± sqrt(8481).

Since e must be between 0 and 107, as per the collinear points D, E, C, F, we take the positive root: e= -92 + sqrt(8481).

So, CE=107 - e=107 - (-92 + sqrt(8481))=199 - sqrt(8481).

Wait, but 199 - sqrt(8481) is approximately 199 -92.09≈106.91, as before.

But since the problem gives integer lengths, perhaps the exact value is an integer, and I might have made a mistake in my approach.

Let me think differently. Maybe the circle condition can be used to find a relation between e and f without involving sqrt.

Alternatively, perhaps using the cyclic quadrilateral properties.

Wait, since ADHG is cyclic, the power of point C with respect to the circle can be considered. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry again, but maybe I made a mistake in the earlier approach.

Wait, another approach: Since the circle passes through A(0,16), D(0,0), G(f,17), and H(e,17), we can write the general equation of the circle and find the condition.

Earlier, I found that the equation is x² + y² + 2gx -16y =0.

Point G(f,17) lies on the circle:

f² + 17² + 2g f -16*17 =0 → f² +289 +2g f -272=0 → f² +2g f +17=0.

Similarly, point H(e,17) lies on the circle:

e² + 2g e +17=0.

Subtracting these two equations: f² - e² +2g(f -e)=0.

Which factors as (f-e)(f+e) +2g(f-e)=0 → (f-e)(f+e +2g)=0.

Since f ≠ e, f+e +2g=0 → 2g= - (f+e).

Now, from the equation for point G: f² +2g f +17=0.

Substituting 2g= - (f+e):

f² -f(f+e) +17=0 → f² -f² -ef +17=0 → -ef +17=0 → ef=17.

Which is consistent with earlier results.

So, f -e=184 and ef=17.

So, e and f are roots of the quadratic equation x^2 - (f + e)x + ef=0 → x^2 - (s)x +17=0, where s =e +f.

But since f -e=184, s= e +f= e + (e +184)=2e +184.

But we also have from earlier, 2g= -s → g= -s/2.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find (e +f)^2 = (f-e)^2 +4ef → s^2=184^2 +4*17=33856 +68=33924 → s= sqrt(33924)=sqrt(4*8481)=2*sqrt(8481).

So, e +f=2*sqrt(8481).

But e +f=2e +184=2*sqrt(8481).

So, 2e=2*sqrt(8481) -184 → e= sqrt(8481) -92.

Thus, CE=107 -e=107 - (sqrt(8481) -92)=107 +92 -sqrt(8481)=199 -sqrt(8481).

Which is the same as before.

So, the exact value is 199 -sqrt(8481).

Wait, but 199^2=39601, and (sqrt(8481))^2=8481.

So, 199 -sqrt(8481) is approximately 106.907, as before.

But the problem expects an integer answer. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps the circle condition can be used differently.

Let me think again. The circle passes through A(0,16), D(0,0), G(f,17), and H(e,17).

So, the circle's equation is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy +c=0.

We found c=0, and f= -8.

So, equation is x² + y² + 2gx -16y=0.

Now, substituting point G(f,17):

f² +17² +2g f -16*17=0 → f² +289 +2g f -272=0 → f² +2g f +17=0.

Similarly, point H(e,17):

e² +2g e +17=0.

So, from these two, we have:

f² +2g f +17=0 → equation (1)
e² +2g e +17=0 → equation (2)

Subtracting (2) from (1):

f² - e² +2g(f -e)=0 → (f -e)(f +e +2g)=0.

Since f ≠e, then f +e +2g=0 → equation (3): 2g= - (f +e).

So, substituting 2g= - (f +e) into equation (1):

f² -f(f +e) +17=0 → f² -f² -ef +17=0 → -ef +17=0 → ef=17.

Which is consistent.

Now, since f -e=184, and ef=17, we can write f= e +184.

So, substituting into ef=17: e*(e +184)=17 → e² +184e -17=0.

So, e= [ -184 ± sqrt(184^2 +4*17) ] /2= [ -184 ± sqrt(33924) ]/2.

Which gives e= [ -184 + sqrt(33924) ]/2 or e= [ -184 - sqrt(33924) ]/2.

Since we need e between 0 and 107, we take the positive root:

e= [ -184 + sqrt(33924) ] /2.

As before, sqrt(33924)=2*sqrt(8481), so e= [ -184 +2*sqrt(8481) ] /2= -92 + sqrt(8481).

Thus, CE=107 -e=107 - (-92 + sqrt(8481))=199 - sqrt(8481).

Hmm, I'm getting the same result, so perhaps the answer is indeed 199 - sqrt(8481). But wait, 8481 is 93^2 - 168, which isn't a perfect square. So, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of sqrt(8481), but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about the positions of E and F.

Wait, perhaps E is not between D and C, but rather F is between E and C, but that would mean E is to the left of F, and F to the left of C. But then, EF would be 184, which would require E to be far to the left, making F near to C.

Wait, but if E is to the left of D, and F is between D and C, then D, E, C, F would not be collinear in the specified order.

Wait, the problem states that D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the order is D first, then E, then C, then F.

So, E must be to the right of D, and F to the right of C.

Thus, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.

Therefore, e is between 0 and 107, and f= e +184, which is greater than 107.

So, our earlier approach was correct.

Thus, CE=107 -e=107 - [ (-92 + sqrt(8481)) ]=199 - sqrt(8481).

Wait, but 199^2=39601, 8481=92^2 +17. So, 199 - sqrt(8481) is the exact value, and it's approximately 106.907, which is close to 107, but not exactly 107.

But the problem asks for the length of CE, which is an integer, so perhaps I made a wrong assumption in the problem setup.

Wait, let's check the problem statement again.

Wait, the problem says that EFGH is a rectangle, with FG=17, EF=184.

Wait, in a rectangle, consecutive sides are perpendicular. So, EF is one side, FG is the next, which should be perpendicular. So, if EF is along the x-axis, then FG should be vertical.

Wait, but if EF is 184 and FG is 17, then the rectangle is 184 units long and 17 units high.

So, from point E(e,0), moving to F(f,0), then from F up to G(f,17), and from E up to H(e,17).

So, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the circle equation.

Wait, when I substituted point G into the circle equation, I got f^2 + 2g f +17=0.

Similarly, for point H, e^2 +2g e +17=0.

So, subtracting gives (f^2 -e^2) +2g(f -e)=0 → (f -e)(f +e +2g)=0.

Since f -e=184 ≠0, then f +e +2g=0 → 2g= - (f +e).

Thus, substituting back into equation for G:

f^2 +2g f +17=0 → f^2 -f(f +e) +17=0 → f^2 -f^2 -ef +17=0 → -ef +17=0 → ef=17.

So, correct.

Thus, with e*(e +184)=17, we have e^2 +184e -17=0.

Thus, e= [ -184 ± sqrt(184^2 +4*17) ] /2= [ -184 ± sqrt(33924) ]/2.

Which gives e= [ -184 + 2*sqrt(8481) ]/2= -92 + sqrt(8481).

Thus, CE=107 -e=107 - (-92 + sqrt(8481))=199 - sqrt(8481).

So, perhaps the answer is 199 - sqrt(8481), which is approximately 106.907. But since the problem expects an integer, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the circle passes through A, D, H, G, so maybe I should have considered that H is at (e,17) and G is at (f,17), but perhaps the rectangle is constructed differently.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the rectangle EFGH is constructed such that FG is the horizontal side, and EF is the vertical side. Wait, but the problem states that FG=17 and EF=184, so if EF is vertical, then FG would be horizontal. But the problem says FG=17, EF=184.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the sides. Maybe EF is the vertical side, and FG is the horizontal side.

Wait, let me reevaluate.

If EF is vertical, then from E(e,0) to F(e,184), and then from F to G(f,184), where FG=17, so f -e=17. But that would change the problem.

Wait, but the problem says EFGH is a rectangle, so the sides must be EF and FG, which are adjacent sides. So, if EF is vertical and FG is horizontal, then EF=184, FG=17.

So, E(e,0), F(e,184), G(e +17,184), H(e +17,0).

Wait, but then EF would be vertical with length 184, FG would be horizontal with length 17.

In that case, E and F would have the same x-coordinate, but different y's. So, points E(e,0) and F(e,184).

Then, FG=17 would be from F(e,184) to G(e+17,184), and from E(e,0) to H(e+17,0).

So, in this case, E and H would be on the x-axis, and F and G would be 184 units up.

But then, points D, E, C, F would be collinear. So, D is at (0,0), E is at (e,0), C is at (107,0), F is at (e,184). Wait, but F is at (e,184), which is not on the x-axis, so D, E, C, F cannot be collinear unless F is also on the x-axis, which contradicts F being at (e,184).

Thus, this configuration is not possible.

Therefore, the initial assumption that EF is along the x-axis and FG is vertical is correct.

Thus, perhaps the answer is indeed 199 - sqrt(8481). But since the problem expects an integer, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(8481) more accurately.

We know that 92^2=8464, 93^2=8649.

Compute 92^2=8464.

Compute 92.09^2: Let's compute 92.09^2.

(92 +0.09)^2=92^2 + 2*92*0.09 +0.09^2=8464 +16.56 +0.0081=8464 +16.56=8480.56 +0.0081=8480.5681.

Which is very close to 8481. So, sqrt(8481)=92.09 approximately.

So, 199 -92.09=106.91.

But the problem expects an integer, so perhaps the answer is 107, but that would be if e=0, which is not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the positions of E and F.

Alternatively, perhaps the circle passes through A, D, H, G, which are arranged differently.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the rectangle EFGH is such that H is at (e,17) and G is at (f,17), but perhaps the orientation is different, such that the rectangle is below the x-axis.

In that case, points G and H would be at (f,-17) and (e,-17).

So, the circle passes through A(0,16), D(0,0), G(f,-17), H(e,-17).

So, let's try this scenario.

The general equation of the circle is x² + y² +2gx +2fy +c=0.

Since D(0,0) is on the circle, substituting gives c=0.

Then, point A(0,16) is on the circle: 0 + 256 +0 +32f=0 →32f= -256 →f= -8.

So, equation becomes x² + y² +2gx -16y=0.

Now, point G(f,-17) is on the circle: f² + (-17)^2 +2g f -16*(-17)=0 →f² +289 +2g f +272=0 →f² +2g f +561=0.

Similarly, point H(e,-17) is on the circle: e² +2g e +561=0.

Subtracting these two equations:

f² -e² +2g(f -e)=0 → (f -e)(f +e +2g)=0.

Since f ≠ e, f +e +2g=0 → 2g= -(f +e).

Substituting into equation for G: f² +2g f +561=0 →f² -f(f +e) +561=0 →f² -f² -ef +561=0 →-ef +561=0 → ef=561.

So, ef=561, and f -e=184.

Thus, we have:

e*(e +184)=561 →e^2 +184e -561=0.

Solve for e: e= [ -184 ± sqrt(184^2 +4*561) ] /2 → sqrt(33856 +2244)=sqrt(36100)=190.

Thus, e= (-184 ±190)/2.

We take the positive root because e must be between 0 and 107.

So, e= (-184 +190)/2=6/2=3.

Thus, e=3, and f=3 +184=187.

So, CE=107 -e=107 -3=104.

Wait, that's an integer! So, CE=104.

Hmm, that makes sense. So, where did I go wrong earlier? I think I assumed that G and H were above the x-axis, but perhaps they are below.

So, in this scenario, points G and H are at (f,-17) and (e,-17), respectively.

Thus, the circle passes through A(0,16), D(0,0), G(187,-17), H(3,-17).

Let me verify:

Circle equation: x² + y² +2gx -16y=0.

From point G(187,-17):

187^2 + (-17)^2 +2g*187 -16*(-17)=0 → (34969) + (289) + 374g +272=0 →34969+289=35258, +272=35530.

So, 35530 +374g=0 →374g= -35530 →g= -35530/374= -95.

So, g= -95.

So, equation is x² + y² -190x -16y=0.

Check point H(3,-17):

3^2 + (-17)^2 -190*3 -16*(-17)=9 +289 -570 +272= (9+289)=298, ( -570+272)= -298. So, 298 -298=0. Correct.

Point A(0,16):

0 + 256 -0 -256=0. Correct.

Point D(0,0):

0 +0 -0 -0=0. Correct.

Thus, this configuration works, and CE=104.

Ah! So, I think earlier, I mistakenly placed G and H above the x-axis, but in reality, they are below, which changes the equation and leads to integer solutions.

So, the correct CE is 104.


The length of \( CE \) is \(\boxed{104}\).
