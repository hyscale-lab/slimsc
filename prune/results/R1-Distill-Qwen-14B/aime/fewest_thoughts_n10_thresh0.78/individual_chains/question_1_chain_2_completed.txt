Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| given a system of logarithmic equations. Hmm, let's see.

First, all variables x, y, z are positive real numbers, which is good because logs are defined for positive numbers. The equations are:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

I need to find |log₂(x⁴y³z²)|. Let me try to solve for x, y, z first using the given equations.

I remember that log₂(a/b) = log₂ a - log₂ b. So maybe I can rewrite each equation in terms of log x, log y, log z.

Let me denote:
Let a = log₂ x
Let b = log₂ y
Let c = log₂ z

Then, the equations become:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = log₂ x - log₂ y - log₂ z = a - b - c = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = log₂ y - log₂ x - log₂ z = b - a - c = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = log₂ z - log₂ x - log₂ y = c - a - b = 1/4

So now, I have a system of three equations:

1. a - b - c = 1/2  ...(1)
2. -a + b - c = 1/3 ...(2)
3. -a - b + c = 1/4 ...(3)

Hmm, let's write these equations clearly:

Equation (1): a - b - c = 1/2

Equation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation (3): -a - b + c = 1/4

I need to solve for a, b, c. Let's try to add equations or manipulate them.

If I add equations (1) and (2):

(1)+(2): (a - a) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 1/2 + 1/3
Which simplifies to: 0 + 0 - 2c = 5/6 (since 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 =5/6)

So, -2c =5/6 → c = -5/(12)

Wait, hold on, c is log₂ z, which is a real number, but negative. Since z is positive, log can be negative. That's okay.

So c = -5/12.

Now, let's plug c into another equation. Let's take equation (1):

a - b - (-5/12) = 1/2 → a - b +5/12 =1/2

So, a - b = 1/2 -5/12 = (6/12 -5/12) =1/12 → a - b =1/12 ...(4)

Similarly, take equation (2):

- a + b - (-5/12) =1/3 → -a + b +5/12 =1/3

So, -a + b =1/3 -5/12 = (4/12 -5/12)= -1/12 → -a + b = -1/12 ...(5)

Now, equations (4) and (5):

(4): a - b =1/12

(5): -a + b = -1/12

If I add (4) and (5):

(a -a) + (-b +b) =1/12 -1/12 → 0=0. Hmm, that's not helpful. Maybe I can solve for a or b.

From (4): a = b +1/12

Plugging into (5):

-(b +1/12) + b = -1/12 → -b -1/12 + b = -1/12 → -1/12 = -1/12. Well, that's an identity, so it doesn't give new info.

So perhaps I need to use equation (3). Let's recall equation (3):

- a - b + c =1/4

We know c is -5/12, so:

- a - b -5/12 =1/4 → -a -b =1/4 +5/12 = 3/12 +5/12=8/12=2/3

So, -a - b =2/3 → a + b= -2/3 ...(6)

But from equation (4): a = b +1/12. Plugging into equation (6):

(b +1/12) +b = -2/3 → 2b +1/12 = -2/3

Subtract 1/12: 2b = -2/3 -1/12 = (-8/12 -1/12)= -9/12= -3/4

So, 2b = -3/4 → b= -3/8

Then from equation (4): a = b +1/12= (-3/8) +1/12

Convert to common denominator, which is 24:

-3/8 = -9/24, and 1/12=2/24. So a= (-9/24 +2/24)= (-7)/24

So a = -7/24, b= -3/8, c= -5/12.

So, let me recap:

a = log₂ x = -7/24 → x=2^(-7/24)

b = log₂ y = -3/8 → y=2^(-3/8)

c = log₂ z = -5/12 → z=2^(-5/12)

Wait, but I need to compute log₂(x⁴ y³ z²). Let me write that in terms of a, b, c.

log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) =4 log₂ x +3 log₂ y +2 log₂ z =4a +3b +2c

So, substituting the values:

4a =4*(-7/24)= -28/24= -7/6

3b=3*(-3/8)= -9/8

2c=2*(-5/12)= -10/12= -5/6

So adding them up:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6

First, let's compute -7/6 -5/6: that's (-7-5)/6= -12/6= -2

Then, -2 -9/8= -2 -1.125= -3.125

But in fractions: convert -2 to eighths. -2= -16/8

So, -16/8 -9/8= -25/8

So, log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)= -25/8

Taking the absolute value: | -25/8 | =25/8

Wait, so it's 25/8. So m=25, n=8, which are coprime.

So m+n=25+8=33.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting from the system:

Equation (1): a -b -c=1/2

Equation (2): -a +b -c=1/3

Equation (3): -a -b +c=1/4

We found c=-5/12

From (1): a-b=1/2 +c=1/2 -5/12= (6/12 -5/12)=1/12 → a= b +1/12

From (3): -a -b +c=1/4 → -a -b=1/4 -c=1/4 +5/12=3/12 +5/12=8/12=2/3 → a + b= -2/3

Then, a + b= -2/3 and a= b +1/12.

Substituting a: (b +1/12) +b= -2/3 → 2b +1/12= -2/3

Multiply both sides by 12 to eliminate denominators: 24b +1= -8

So, 24b= -9 → b= -9/24= -3/8. Correct.

Then a= b +1/12= (-3/8) +1/12= (-9/24 +2/24)= -7/24. Correct.

c= -5/12. Correct.

So then 4a +3b +2c:

4*(-7/24)= -28/24= -7/6

3*(-3/8)= -9/8

2*(-5/12)= -10/12= -5/6

Adding: -7/6 -5/6= -12/6= -2

Then, -2 -9/8= (-16/8 -9/8)= -25/8. Absolute value is 25/8, so m=25, n=8, m+n=33.

Wait, that all seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the steps. So the answer should be 33.


The given system of equations involves logarithms of ratios of variables, which can be transformed into a linear system by introducing new variables for the logarithms. Solving this system yields the logarithms of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). Substituting these into the expression for \(\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\) and simplifying gives the value \(\frac{25}{8}\). Taking the absolute value and summing the numerator and denominator yields \(25 + 8 = 33\).

\(\boxed{33}\)
