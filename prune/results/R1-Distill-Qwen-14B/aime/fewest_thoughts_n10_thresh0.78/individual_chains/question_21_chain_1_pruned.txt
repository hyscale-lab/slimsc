Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A number n is called b-eautiful if when you write it in base b, it has exactly two digits, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. 

Hmm, let me parse this. So, a two-digit number in base b would be something like "ab" where a and b are digits in base b. But wait, actually, in base b, the digits can't exceed b-1, right? So, for example, in base 10, the digits are 0-9. So, in base b, the first digit can be from 1 to b-1 (since leading zeros aren't allowed in numbers) and the second digit can be from 0 to b-1.

So, a two-digit number in base b would represent the value a*b + c, where a is the first digit (1 ≤ a ≤ b-1) and c is the second digit (0 ≤ c ≤ b-1). 

Now, the sum of the digits is a + c, and according to the problem, this sum should equal the square root of n. So, n = (a + c)^2. But also, n is equal to a*b + c. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

So, the key equation is a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

My goal is to find, for each base b, how many pairs (a, c) satisfy this equation. Then, find the smallest b where the number of such pairs exceeds 10.

Alright, so for a given b, we can iterate through possible a and c values and see if they satisfy the equation. But since I'm looking for the minimal b where more than ten such numbers exist, I might need to find a way to model this equation better.

Let me rearrange the equation:

a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

Let me expand the right-hand side:

a*b + c = a² + 2ac + c².

Then, moving everything to one side:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this or find some relation. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of a or c.

Alternatively, let's write the equation as:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

But since (a + c)^2 must be equal to a*b + c, perhaps I can solve for b in terms of a and c.

From the equation:

b = ( (a + c)^2 - c ) / a.

Simplify that:

b = (a² + 2ac + c² - c ) / a.

Which can be rewritten as:

b = a + 2c + (c² - c)/a.

Hmm, but since b must be an integer, and a must divide (c² - c), right? Because the other terms are integers.

So, for each a and c, we can compute if a divides (c² - c). If it does, then b is an integer, and that's a valid solution.

But perhaps this approach is a bit too abstract. Let me try another angle.

Let me consider that for a given b, I can vary a from 1 to b-1, and for each a, find the possible c that satisfy the equation. 

The equation is a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

Let me rearrange it:

(a + c)^2 - a*b - c = 0.

But perhaps it's better to express c in terms of a and b.

Let me rearrange the equation:

c = (a + c)^2 - a*b.

Wait, that seems circular. Maybe better to treat it as a quadratic equation in c.

Let me write it as:

c² + (2a -1)c + a² - a*b = 0.

Yes, that's a quadratic in terms of c. So, for given a and b, this equation can have solutions for c.

The quadratic equation is c² + (2a -1)c + (a² - a*b) = 0.

To find integer solutions for c, the discriminant must be a perfect square. The discriminant D is:

D = (2a -1)^2 - 4 * 1 * (a² - a*b).

Let me compute D:

D = 4a² -4a +1 -4a² +4a*b.

Simplify:

D = (-4a +1) +4a*b.

So,

D = 4a*b -4a +1.

Which can be written as:

D = 4a(b -1) +1.

For c to be an integer, D must be a perfect square. So, 4a(b -1) +1 must be a perfect square.

Let me denote k^2 = 4a(b -1) +1.

So, k^2 = 4a(b -1) +1.

Then, 4a(b -1) = k^2 - 1.

Which factors as (k -1)(k +1).

So, 4a(b -1) = (k -1)(k +1).

Since a and b are positive integers, and a ≥1, b ≥2, so 4a(b-1) must be at least 4*1*(2-1) =4.

So, k must be greater than or equal to 3, because 3^2=9 and 4a(b-1) is at least 4.

Wait, but 4a(b-1) must be even because 4a is even. So, (k-1)(k+1) must be even, which is true because either k-1 or k+1 is even.

But perhaps more importantly, (k-1) and (k+1) are two consecutive even numbers if k is odd. Wait, no: if k is even, then both k-1 and k+1 are odd, which would make (k-1)(k+1) odd, but 4a(b-1) is even. So, this suggests that k must be odd because if k is even, then (k-1) and (k+1) are both odd, making their product odd, which cannot equal 4a(b-1), which is even. Therefore, k must be odd.

So, let me let k = 2m +1, where m is a positive integer.

Then, k -1 = 2m and k +1 = 2m +2.

Therefore,

4a(b-1) = (2m)(2m + 2) = 4m(m +1).

Divide both sides by 4:

a(b -1) = m(m +1).

So, a = [m(m +1)] / (b -1).

Hmm, so a must be an integer, so (b -1) must divide m(m +1).

But since a must be at least 1, [m(m +1)] / (b -1) ≥1.

So, m(m+1) ≥ b -1.

But I'm not sure if this is the best way to approach it.

Alternatively, from a(b-1) = m(m+1), we can see that for each m, a must be a divisor of m(m+1). Since m and m+1 are coprime, the divisors of m(m+1) are products of divisors of m and divisors of m+1.

So, a can be expressed as a = d, where d divides m(m+1), and then (b-1) = [m(m+1)] / d.

Hmm, perhaps it's getting too abstract. Maybe I should try to find, for each b, how many solutions (a,c) exist.

Alternatively, think about for a given b, the equation a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

We can rewrite this as:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Let me define s = a + c. Then, the equation becomes:

s^2 = a*b + c.

But since s = a + c, we can write c = s - a.

Substituting into the equation:

s^2 = a*b + (s - a).

Which simplifies to:

s^2 = a*b + s - a.

Rearranging terms:

s^2 - s = a*(b -1).

So, a = (s^2 - s) / (b -1).

Since a must be an integer, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b-1).

But also, a must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1, and c = s - a must satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

So, s must be such that c is a valid digit in base b, i.e., 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

So, 0 ≤ s - a ≤ b-1.

But a = (s^2 - s)/(b -1).

So, substituting, 0 ≤ s - (s^2 - s)/(b -1) ≤ b -1.

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe for a given b, I can iterate over possible s and see if a is integer and c is valid.

Alternatively, for each b, iterate over possible s and see if (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and then compute a and c.

Wait, let's think about s.

Since a is at least 1, and a = (s^2 - s)/(b -1) ≥1.

So, s^2 - s ≥ b -1.

Also, since c = s - a must be ≤ b -1, let's see:

c = s - a = s - (s^2 - s)/(b -1).

So, c = [ (s)(b -1) - s^2 + s ] / (b -1 )

Simplify numerator:

s(b -1) - s^2 + s = s*b - s - s^2 + s = s*b - s^2.

So, c = (s*b - s^2)/(b -1) = s*(b - s)/(b -1
