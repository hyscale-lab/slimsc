Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are defined as y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe if I break it down step by step, I can figure it out.

First, let me understand what f(x) and g(x) are. They are both defined as absolute value functions. So, f(x) is ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. These functions are transformations of absolute value functions, so their graphs are V-shaped, but shifted and possibly reflected.

Let me visualize f(x) first. The inner part is |x|, so it's a V-shape opening upwards with its vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2: |x| - 1/2 would shift this V down by 1/2 unit. But since we're taking the absolute value of that, it becomes ||x| - 1/2|. So, this will create a W shape, right? Because wherever |x| - 1/2 is negative, taking the absolute value will reflect it back up. So f(x) has vertices where |x| = 1/2, so at x = ±1/2, the function f(x) will have a V pointing upwards with a minimum at x=0, y=1/2.

Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. The same logic applies here. The inner |x| is a V, subtract 1/4, then take absolute value. So g(x) will also create a W shape. The original |x| - 1/4 will have a minimum at x=0, y=-1/4, but since we take absolute value, it's flipped to a V pointing upwards, with vertices at x=±1/4.

Wait, maybe I should plot f(x) and g(x) to get a better idea.

For f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|:
- At x = 0: |0 - 1/2| = 1/2.
- At x = 1/2: |1/2 - 1/2| = 0, then absolute value is 0.
- At x = 1: |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.
So the graph goes up to 1/2 at x=0, down to 0 at x=1/2, back up to 1/2 at x=1, and similarly on the negative side. So it's a W shape with peaks at 1/2 and valleys at 0 and 1.

For g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|:
- At x=0: |0 - 1/4| = 1/4.
- At x=1/4: |1/4 - 1/4| = 0.
- At x=1/2: |1/2 - 1/4| = 1/4.
So this is also a W shape, but with peaks at 1/4 and valleys at 0 and 1/2. So the graph is similar to f(x) but on a smaller scale.

Now, moving on to the functions y and x in the problem. The first function is y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's dissect this.

Start with sin(2πx). The sine function has a period of 1 (since 2π / (2π) = 1). So sin(2πx) oscillates between -1 and 1, completing a full cycle every integer x.

Then f is applied to sin(2πx). So f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Let me think about this. The inner |sin(2πx)| makes it non-negative, so we have a function that oscillates between 0 and 1, because sin ranges from -1 to 1, take absolute value, so 0 to 1, then subtract 1/2. So | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |.

So after f, the function will have values in [0, 1/2]. Because when |sin(2πx)| is 1, then 1 - 1/2 = 1/2, and when it's 0, |0 - 1/2| = 1/2. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, |sin(2πx)| varies from 0 to 1. So | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |: when |sin(2πx)| is 1, that's 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| is 0, that's | - 1/2 | = 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| is 1/2, that's |1/2 - 1/2| = 0. So f(sin(2πx)) is a function that goes from 0 to 1/2, oscillating. It's a V shape with minima at 0 and maxima at 1/2.

Wait, more precisely, for sin(2πx), it's periodic with period 1, but when you take absolute value, it's period 1/2. Then f applied to that is another transformation.

So f(sin
