Alright, so I have this math problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then compute r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, I have to find p + q. 

Okay, let me start by understanding the problem. We have a set of rectangular boxes, each with surface area 54 and volume 23. For each of these boxes, I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain it. The radius of this sphere will vary depending on the dimensions of the box. My goal is to find the maximum possible radius among all these boxes because the smallest sphere that can contain all boxes must be able to contain the 'largest' box in some sense. Wait, no, actually, for each box, the sphere's radius depends on the box's dimensions. But since all boxes have the same surface area and volume, the maximum sphere radius needed would be determined by the box with the largest possible space diagonal, right? Because the sphere must enclose the box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least the space diagonal of the box. Therefore, the radius is half of that. So, I think the problem reduces to maximizing the space diagonal of the box given the constraints on surface area and volume.

So, let's denote the edges of the box as x, y, z. Then, the surface area S is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume V is xyz = 23. The space diagonal D is sqrt(x² + y² + z²), so the radius r is D/2. Therefore, I need to maximize D, which is equivalent to maximizing D² = x² + y² + z², given the constraints 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

So, the problem becomes: maximize x² + y² + z² subject to 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Hmm, how do I approach this optimization problem? Maybe using Lagrange multipliers since we have multiple constraints. But I'm not too familiar with multivariable calculus, but perhaps I can recall that for symmetric constraints, the maximum or minimum often occurs when variables are equal, but in this case, the volume is fixed, which complicates things. Maybe it's better to use substitution to reduce the number of variables.

Let me see. Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + zx, and Q = xyz = 23. We know that 2P = 54, so P = 27. So P is fixed.

I need to maximize x² + y² + z². But x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = S² - 2P.

Since P is fixed at 27, to maximize x² + y² + z², I need to maximize S². So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of S, given that S² is as large as possible, with P = 27 and Q = 23.

Wait, but how does S relate to P and Q? There's a relation through the roots of a cubic equation. If x, y, z are the roots of the equation t³ - St² + Pt - Q = 0, which is t³ - S t² + 27 t - 23 = 0.

So, for real positive roots x, y, z. The question is, what's the maximum possible S such that this equation has three positive real roots with product 23 and sum S, and sum of products 27.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for fixed P and Q, S can vary, and I need the maximum S. But how?

I remember from inequalities that for positive real numbers, the maximum of x² + y² + z² occurs when one variable is as large as possible, and the others are as small as possible, given the constraints. So perhaps to maximize D², I should let one dimension be as large as possible, and the other two as small as possible, but keeping the product xyz = 23 and 2(xy + yz + zx)=54.

Alternatively, maybe using Lagrange multipliers is the way to go. Let's set up the Lagrangian function. Let me define the function to maximize as f(x,y,z) = x² + y² + z². The constraints are g(x,y,z) = 2(xy + yz + zx) -54 = 0 and h(x,y,z) = xyz -23 = 0.

The Lagrangian is L = x² + y² + z² - λ (2(xy + yz + zx) -54) - μ (xyz -23).

Taking partial derivatives:

dL/dx = 2x - λ(2y + 2z) - μ yz = 0

dL/dy = 2y - λ(2x + 2z) - μ xz = 0

dL/dz = 2z - λ(2x + 2y) - μ xy = 0

Also, the constraints:

2(xy + yz + zx) =54

xyz=23

So, we have a system of equations:

2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ yz =0  ...(1)

2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ xz =0  ...(2)

2z - 2λ(x + y) - μ xy =0  ...(3)

Let me subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ xz - [2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ yz] = 0

Simplify:

2(y - x) - 2λ(x + z - y - z) - μ(xz - yz) =0

Simplify term by term:

2(y - x) - 2λ(x - y) - μ z (x - y) =0

Factor out (y -x):

[2 + 2λ + μ z] (y -x) =0

So, either y =x, or 2 + 2λ + μ z =0.

But the variables are positive, so if 2 + 2λ + μ z=0, but λ and μ are Lagrange multipliers, which could be negative or positive. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to assume that x = y = z, but wait, that would be a cube. Let's check if such a cube exists with surface area 54 and volume 23.

If x=y=z=a, then surface area is 6a²=54 => a²=9 => a=3. Then volume is 27, but we need 23. So, no, the maximum volume for a cube with surface area 54 is 27, which is larger than 23. So, the box we're seeking is not a cube, but perhaps close to a cube? Or maybe elongated in one dimension.

Wait, but for the maximum space diagonal, perhaps the box is as "stretched out" as possible. So, maybe two sides are as small as possible, and the third is as large as possible, keeping the volume 23 and surface area 54.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal. Let me try to assume that y = z. Then, we can express everything in terms of x and y.

Let y = z. Then, the surface area is 2(xy + y² + xy) = 2(2xy +
