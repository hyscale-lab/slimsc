Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. And ω is a 13th root of unity, not equal to 1. Hmm, that's the setup.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when dealing with polynomials. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity (since ω ≠ 1 and 13 is prime), it satisfies ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial over the integers is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Wait, actually, cyclotomic polynomials are factors of x^n - 1. For prime n, Φ_n(x) = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} + ... + x + 1.

But how does that help me here? I'm dealing with a product involving ω^k for k from 0 to 12. So maybe I can express this product in terms of polynomials evaluated at certain points.

Let me write out the product as ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Maybe I can factor this expression somehow or relate it to a known polynomial.

Wait, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} can be rewritten. Let me see:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2.

Hmm, that's a quadratic in ω^k. Let me set x = ω^k, so the expression becomes x² - 2x + 2. So the product becomes ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x² - 2x + 2) where x = ω^k.

But wait, since ω is a primitive 13th root, as k runs from 0 to 12, ω^k runs through all the 13th roots of unity. So, the product is the product of (x² - 2x + 2) evaluated at each 13th root of unity.

I remember that for a polynomial P(x), the product over all roots α of (x - α) is P(x). But here, I have a product over all roots of another polynomial evaluated at each root. Hmm, maybe I can relate this to the value of some polynomial evaluated at certain points.

Wait
