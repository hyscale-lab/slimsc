Okay, so Iâ€™ve got this problem: I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting.

First, I should visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, I think. But maybe that's not immediately relevant.

The problem mentions that the sides of the rectangles lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the sides of these rectangles are either the edges of the dodecagon or the diagonals connecting non-adjacent vertices.

Wait, so the rectangles are formed by connecting these sides and diagonals. So, each rectangle must have its four sides either as sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with many sides, you can form various shapes by connecting vertices with sides or diagonals. In a square, for example, you can only form one rectangle, which is the square itself. But in a regular hexagon, you can have multiple rectangles.

So, perhaps in a dodecagon, which is 12-sided, the number of rectangles is more significant. But how do I approach counting them?

I think the key is to recognize that a rectangle is defined by two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, sides and diagonals can be parallel if they are spaced in certain ways.

Wait, in a regular polygon, sides can be parallel if the number of sides between them is a multiple of a certain number. For example, in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel because there are three sides between them, which is half of six. Similarly, in a dodecagon, sides can be parallel if the number of steps between them is 6 (since 12/2 =6).

But wait, in the dodecagon, the sides are just the edges. Diagonals can also be parallel. So perhaps the idea is to find pairs of parallel sides or diagonals that can form the opposite sides of a rectangle.

But rectangles require two pairs of parallel sides, each pair perpendicular to the other. So, the sides of the rectangle must be either sides or diagonals, and these sides must be parallel and meet at right angles.

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of selecting two pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) that are perpendicular to each other. The intersection of these lines would form the vertices of the rectangle.

So, perhaps I can approach this by first identifying all possible pairs of parallel lines in the dodecagon. Then, for each such pair, find another pair that is perpendicular to them, and then count the rectangles formed by their intersections.

Wait, but how do I systematically do that? Let me think.

First, I should figure out how many lines (s
