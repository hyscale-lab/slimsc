Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it and figure out what's going on.

We're given triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. The first condition is that IA is perpendicular to OI. Also, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB · AC.

Hmm, okay. Let me jot down what I know.

1. Triangle ABC with circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6.
2. IA ⊥ OI.
3. Need to find AB · AC.

I remember that the circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle. The formula for the circumradius is R = (a b c)/(4Δ), where a, b, c are the sides and Δ is the area. The inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter, r = Δ/s, where s = (a + b + c)/2.

But I'm not sure how to connect IA being perpendicular to OI. Maybe I can find some relations involving distances between the incenter and circumcenter, or perhaps use coordinate geometry?

Wait, maybe I should recall that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me check that.

Yes, OI² = R² - 2Rr. So OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13).

Hmm, okay. So the distance between the incenter and circumradius is sqrt(13). But we also have that IA is perpendicular to OI. So perhaps vectorially, the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates. Let me try setting up a coordinate system.

Let me place point I at (0, 0) since it's the incenter. Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is the line from I (0,0) to O. Let me denote the coordinates of O as (h, k). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, which is the vector (h, k). IA is the vector from I (0,0) to A, which is some point (x, y). So the vector IA is (x, y). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product is zero: x*h + y*k = 0.

Wait, but I don't know where A is. Maybe another approach is better.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that in triangle ABC, the inradius is r, the semiperimeter is s, and the area is Δ = r*s. So Δ = 6*s.

Also, the area can be written using the circumradius: Δ = (a b c)/(4R) = (a b c)/(52). So 6s = (a b c)/52, which gives a b c = 312 s.

Hmm, but I don't know s yet.

Wait, also, the product AB · AC is equal to c ·
