Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity and ω ≠ 1. Hmm, 13th roots of unity... I remember these are complex numbers that satisfy ω^13 = 1. So, they're evenly spaced around the unit circle in the complex plane. 

First, I need to compute the product Π_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). That seems complicated because it's a product of 13 terms, each involving ω^k. But maybe there's a way to simplify this expression.

Let me write out the product more explicitly. For each k, the term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). I can factor out a 2 from the first two terms: 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps express each term as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me see, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} can be written as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. That looks like a quadratic in ω^k: let me denote x = ω^k, then the term is x² - 2x + 2. So, each term is a quadratic in x, where x is a 13th root of unity. 

So, the product becomes Π_{k=0}^{12} (x² - 2x + 2), where x = ω^k. But wait, since ω is a primitive 13th root, the x's are all the 13th roots of unity. So, the product is the product over all x where x^13 =1 of (x² - 2x + 2). 

That rings a bell. There's a theorem or formula about products over roots of unity. I think it relates to evaluating polynomials at roots of unity. Specifically, if we have a polynomial P(x) and we take the product P(x) over all roots x of another polynomial, it might relate to the resultant or something like that.

Wait, more precisely, if I have a polynomial f(x) whose roots are the x's (the 13th roots of unity), then the product of (x - a) over all roots x is equal to f(a). But in this case, my product is not (x - a), but (x² - 2x + 2). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can think of (x² - 2x + 2) as a quadratic polynomial and relate it to cyclotomic polynomials.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the product over all x where x^13 =1 of (x² - 2x + 2). This is similar to evaluating a resultant or the value of a certain polynomial at x=13th roots.

Wait, let me think about how to compute such a product. If I have a polynomial Q(x) = x² - 2x + 2, then the product of Q(x) for all x such that x^13 = 1 would be the same as the product over all x of Q(x). But how do I compute that?

I recall that for a polynomial f(x), the product over all roots x of another polynomial g(x) can be found using the concept of the product over g(x)'s roots. But maybe that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product over x of Q(x) is equal to the product over the roots of x^13 -1 of Q(x). But x^13 - 1 factors into (x - 1)(x - ω)(x - ω²)...(x - ω^12). So, if I take the product over all x where x^13 =1 of Q(x), I can write this as the product over k=0 to 12 of Q(ω^k). But that's exactly what I have here.

So, the product I'm looking for is the product over all 13th roots of unity of Q(x), where Q(x) = x² - 2x + 2. How can I compute this product?

I remember that the product over all roots x of x^13 -1 of (x - a) is equal to the resultant of x^13 -1 and (x - a), which is a^13 -1. But in my case, it's not (x - a), it's a quadratic. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can relate this to polynomials. Suppose I have a polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1, which has roots at all ω^k for k=0 to 12. Then, the product of Q(x) over all roots of f(x) is equal to the resultant of f and Q, or something like that. Alternatively, maybe it's the value of the resultant of f and Q evaluated at some point.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: consider that the product over x of Q(x) where x^13 =1 is equal to the product over x of (x^2 - 2x + 2). So, since x^13=1, for each x, x^13=1, so x is a root of x^13 -1=0.

But maybe it's helpful to note that if I set y = x, then the product becomes the product over y^13=1 of (y² - 2y + 2). So, perhaps I can write this as the product over y of (y² - 2y + 2) where y^13=1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use logarithms to turn the product into a sum? But that might complicate things because dealing with complex logs could get messy.

Wait another idea: perhaps express the product as Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Let me denote z = ω^k. Then, each term is z² - 2z + 2. So, the product is the product over all 13th roots of unity z of (z² - 2z + 2).

Wait a minute, that's equivalent to evaluating the product of Q(z) over all z where z^13=1, which is the same as the product of (z² - 2z + 2) for each 13th root z.

I recall that for a polynomial f(x) = a_n x^n + ... + a_0, the product over all roots x of g(x) of f(x) is equal to the resultant of f and g, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, I think that the product over all roots x of g(x) of f(x) is equal to the resultant of g and f, which can be computed as the determinant of the Sylvester matrix, but that seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, another approach: since all the roots z satisfy z^13 =1, perhaps I can write z^13 =1, so z^13 =1. Therefore, I can write higher powers of z in terms of lower powers modulo z^13 -1.

But how does that help with Q(z)=z² - 2z + 2?

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the product over z of (z² - 2z + 2) is the same as evaluating the polynomial P(x) = Π_{z^13=1} (x² - 2x + 2) at x=z? No, that doesn't seem right because x is a variable, not a specific value.

Wait, maybe I can think of the product as evaluating the value of the polynomial Π_{z} (x - z) evaluated at x being the roots of Q(x). Wait, no, perhaps the other way around.

Wait another idea: Let's consider the product Π_{z} (z² -2z +2) where z^13=1. Let me denote this product as N. So, N = Π_{z} (z² -2z +2).

I can write this as Π_{z} (z² -2z +2).

Let me consider that for each z, z^13=1, so I can express z^13=1.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this product as the product over all z of (z² -2z +2) = product over z of (z - (1 + i)) (z - (1 - i)).

Because the quadratic equation z² - 2z + 2 factors into (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).

So, N = Π_{z} (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).

But each z is a 13th root of unity, so the product becomes [Π_{z} (z - (1 + i))] * [Π_{z} (z - (1 - i))].

But Π_{z} (z - a) is equal to the value of the polynomial f(x) = x^13 -1 evaluated at x = a, because the roots of x^13 -1 are exactly the z's. Wait, no, that's not quite right. 

Wait, if f(x) = x^13 -1, then f(x) = Π_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k). So, if I evaluate f(a), I get Π_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k). So, Π_{z} (a - z) = a^13 -1. 

Yes, that's correct! Because f(a) = a^13 -1 = Π_{z} (a - z). So, that gives me Π_{z} (a - z) = a^13 -1. 

So, applying that here, Π_{z} (z - (1 + i)) = (1 + i)^13 -1. Similarly, Π_{z} (z - (1 - i)) = (1 - i)^13 -1.

Wait, no, wait: in the standard case, f(x) = Π_{z} (x - z). So, Π_{z} (x - z) = x^13 -1. Therefore, Π_{z} (a - z) = a^13 -1. So, if I set a = (1 + i), then Π_{z} ( (1 + i) - z ) = (1 + i)^13 -1. Similarly for (1 - i).

But in our case, we have Π_{z} (z - (1 + i)) = Π_{z} ( -( (1 + i) - z ) ) = (-1)^{13} * Π_{z} ( (1 + i) - z ) = - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ). 

Because (z - a) = -(a - z), and since there are 13 terms, (-1)^13 = -1.

Similarly, Π_{z} (z - (1 - i)) = - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ).

Therefore, N = [ - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ].

Simplifying that, N = [ - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ] = [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ].

So, N = [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ].

Now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

First, let me compute (1 + i)^13.

I know that 1 + i can be represented in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is π/4 radians (45 degrees). So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) e^{iπ/4}.

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i *13*(π/4)}.

Similarly, (1 - i) has modulus sqrt(2), and argument -π/4, so (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i *13*(π/4)}.

Let me compute [sqrt(2)]^13 first.

sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

Now, let's compute the exponents.

For (1 + i)^13: angle is 13*(π/4) = (13/4)π. 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, which is 3π + π/4.

But angles are periodic modulo 2π, so let's subtract 2π until we get an angle between 0 and 2π.

3π + π/4 = (13π)/4. Subtract 2π (which is 8π/4) to get (13π/4 - 8π/4) = 5π/4. So, the angle is 5π/4, which is in the third quadrant.

Similarly, for (1 - i)^13: angle is -13*(π/4) = -13π/4. Adding multiples of 2π to bring it into the standard range.

-13π/4 + 4π = -13π/4 + 16π/4 = 3π/4.

So, angles are 5π/4 and 3π/4.

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4)].

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [cos(3π/4) + i sin(3π/4)].

Let me compute cos and sin for these angles.

cos(5π/4) = -√2/2, sin(5π/4) = -√2/2.

cos(3π/4) = -√2/2, sin(3π/4) = √2/2.

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-√2/2) + i (-√2/2) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * ( -√2/2 (1 + i) )

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-√2/2) + i (√2/2) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * ( -√2/2 (1 - i) )

Let me compute these terms.

First, 64*sqrt(2) * (-√2/2) = 64 * (sqrt(2)*(-√2))/2 = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.

So, (1 + i)^13 = -64*(1 + i).

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64*(1 - i).

Wait, let me check that calculation again:

(1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-√2/2) + i (-√2/2) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-√2/2)(1 + i) 

sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2, so sqrt(2)*(-√2/2) = (-2)/2 = -1. So, 64*sqrt(2)*(-√2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64. So, yes, that's correct. So, (1 + i)^13 = -64*(1 + i).

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-√2/2) + i (√2/2) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-√2/2)(1 - i) 

Again, sqrt(2)*(-√2/2) = (-2)/2 = -1, so (1 - i)^13 = -64*(1 - i).

So, now, going back to the product N:

N = [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ] = [ (-64*(1 + i)) -1 ] * [ (-64*(1 - i)) -1 ]

Let me compute each bracket separately.

First bracket: (-64*(1 + i) ) -1 = -64 -64i -1 = (-65) -64i.

Second bracket: (-64*(1 - i)) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = (-65) +64i.

So, N = [ (-65 -64i) ] * [ (-65 +64i) ]

This looks like the product of a complex number and its conjugate, which should be the square of the modulus.

Indeed, (a - bi)(a + bi) = a² + b².

So, a = -65, b = 64.

Wait, no: the terms are (-65 -64i) and (-65 +64i). So, a = -65, b=64.

So, their product is (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = (65)^2 + (64)^2.

Compute that:

65² = 4225.

64² = 4096.

So, sum is 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

So, N = 8321.

Wait, so the product is 8321. Now, we need to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000.

Dividing 8321 by 1000: 8321 = 8*1000 + 321. So, the remainder is 321.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, the product N = [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ].

We found that (1 + i)^13 = -64*(1 + i) and (1 - i)^13 = -64*(1 - i). So, subtracting 1:

-64*(1 + i) -1 = -65 -64i.

-64*(1 - i) -1 = -65 +64i.

Multiplying these: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(i²). But i² = -1, so this is 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Yes, that's correct.

So the product is 8321. Now, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

Therefore, the remainder is 321.

Wait a second, but before I conclude, let me think if I missed anything. The product was from k=0 to 12 of (2 -2ω^k + ω^{2k}), which we converted into the product over z of (z² -2z +2), which became [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ] = 8321. So, yes, the remainder when divided by 1000 is 321.

I think that's solid. So, the answer should be 321.


The problem requires finding the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity.

First, we recognize that each term \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\) can be rewritten as a quadratic in \(\omega^k\): \(\omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2\). Letting \(z = \omega^k\), the product becomes \(\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\).

This product can be expressed as \(\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i))\), which factors into two products: \(\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 + i))\) and \(\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 - i))\). Using the property of cyclotomic polynomials, \(\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - a) = a^{13} - 1\), we find:

\[
\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 + i)) = (1 + i)^{13} - 1
\]
\[
\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 - i)) = (1 - i)^{13} - 1
\]

Calculating \((1 + i)^{13}\) and \((1 - i)^{13}\) using polar forms, we find:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} = -64(1 + i), \quad (1 - i)^{13} = -64(1 - i)
\]

Thus,

\[
(1 + i)^{13} - 1 = -65 - 64i, \quad (1 - i)^{13} - 1 = -65 + 64i
\]

The product of these terms is:

\[
(-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321
\]

Finally, dividing 8321 by 1000 gives a remainder of 321. Therefore, the remainder is:

\[
\boxed{321}
\]
