Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking. 

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. We need to find Q + R.

Alright, so N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. And it's the greatest such number with a particular property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Interesting.

Let me break it down. N is a four-digit number, so let's represent it as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A not zero. So N = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D.

The condition is that if you change any single digit (A, B, C, or D) to 1, the number becomes divisible by 7. So, changing A to 1, B to 1, C to 1, or D to 1, each results in a number that's a multiple of 7.

Our goal is to find the largest such N, then compute Q and R when N is divided by 1000, which are the quotient and remainder respectively. So Q is N // 1000, and R is N % 1000, and we need Q + R.

Since N is a four-digit number, Q will be A (since 1000*A is the thousands place). R will be 100*B + 10*C + D. So Q + R would be A + (100*B + 10*C + D) = 100*B + 10*C + D + A. But wait, 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D is N, so Q + R is (A) + (N - 1000*A) = N - 999*A. Hmm, that might not be super useful. Maybe just compute Q and R separately.

But first, let's focus on finding N.

So, N is the largest four-digit number such that changing any digit to 1 makes it divisible by 7. Let me think about how to approach this.

Let me denote the digits of N as A, B, C, D. So N = ABCD.

If I change A to 1, the number becomes 1BCD. So 1BCD must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, changing B to 1: A1CD must be divisible by 7.

Changing C to 1: AB1D must be divisible by 7.

Changing D to 1: ABC1 must be divisible by 7.

So, four conditions:

1. 1BCD ≡ 0 mod7

2. A1CD ≡ 0 mod7

3. AB1D ≡ 0 mod7

4. ABC1 ≡ 0 mod7

Our goal is to find the largest N (ABCD) such that all four of these are true.

Since N is four digits, and we want the greatest one, it's probably better to start checking from 9999 downwards, but that might take too long. There must be a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find constraints on the digits based on these conditions.

Let me think: Let's express each condition mathematically.

1. 1BCD mod7 = 0: So 1000 + 100*B + 10*C + D ≡0 mod7.

2. A1CD mod7 =0: 1000*A + 100*1 + 10*C + D ≡0 mod7.

3. AB1D mod7=0: 1000*A + 100*B + 10*1 + D ≡0 mod7.

4. ABC1 mod7=0: 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + 1 ≡0 mod7.

So, four congruences:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡0 mod7.

2. 1000A + 100 +10C + D ≡0 mod7.

3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡0 mod7.

4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡0 mod7.

Let me compute each of these modulo7:

But perhaps first, we can compute 1000 mod7, 100 mod7, 10 mod7, and 1 mod7.

Compute:

10^0 mod7=1

10^1 mod7=3 (since 10/7=1*7+3)

10^2 mod7=3^2=9 mod7=2

10^3 mod7=3^3=27 mod7=6

So:

1000 mod7 = 6

100 mod7 = 2

10 mod7=3

1 mod7=1.

So:

1. 1000 + 100B +10C + D ≡6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

2. 1000A + 100 +10C + D ≡6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡6A + 2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7.

4. 1000A + 100B +10C +1 ≡
