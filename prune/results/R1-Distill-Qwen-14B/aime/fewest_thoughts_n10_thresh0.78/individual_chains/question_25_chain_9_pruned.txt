Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, let's parse the information given. There are 900 residents total. They own various items: diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and a bag of candy hearts. Wait, so four items in total? Because each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which is interesting. So that means every single person owns at least a bag of candy hearts. That might be important.

The numbers given are:
- 195 own a diamond ring.
- 367 own a set of golf clubs.
- 562 own a garden spade.
- And everyone owns candy hearts, which is 900.

Additionally, it's stated that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. The question is asking how many own all four items.

Hmm, okay. So this seems like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that from set theory. The idea is to account for all the overlaps between the sets without double-counting.

Let me recall the formula. For four sets A, B, C, D, the total number of elements is given by:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D| - |A∩B∩C∩D|

But in this problem, we're given some other information. Instead of the intersections, we're told how many people own exactly two or exactly three items. So maybe I need to connect this information with the inclusion-exclusion principle.

Wait, another approach: the total number of residents is 900, and each owns at least a candy heart. So the total is 900. Let's denote the sets as follows:

C = set of people who own candy hearts (so |C|=900)
D = diamond ring owners (195)
G = golf clubs (367)
S = garden spade (562)

We need to find |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|, which is the number of people owning all four items.

But the problem gives us the number of people owning exactly two and exactly three items. Let's think about how that relates.

I remember that in inclusion-exclusion, the formula can be adjusted based on the number of people in exactly k sets. Maybe we can use the concept where the total is the sum of people in each set minus those in exactly two, plus those in exactly three, minus those in all four? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, so let me think.

Wait, maybe it's better to model the problem using the principle of inclusion-exclusion considering the overlaps. But since the problem gives the counts for exactly two and exactly three, and we're to find those with all four, perhaps we can model the total number as:

Total = sum of each individual item owner - sum of exactly two-item owners + sum of exactly three-item owners - sum of exactly four-item owners.

Wait, is that right? I'm trying to remember. Let me think in terms of the inclusion-exclusion formula.

The standard inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets is:

Total = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - (sum of all pairwise intersections) + (sum of all triple intersections) - (the four-way intersection).

But in our case, we don't have the pairwise or triple intersections directly. Instead, we have the number of people in exactly two and
