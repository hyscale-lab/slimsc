Okay, so I've got this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

Let me write down the given equations first. The first one is log_x(y^x) = 10. I remember that log_b(a^c) = c*log_b(a), so maybe I can simplify that.

So, log_x(y^x) is equal to x * log_x(y), right? And that equals 10. So equation one becomes:
x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the same logarithm power rule, that's equal to 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Now, I have two equations:
1) x * log_x(y) = 10
2) 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, I notice that log_x(y) and log_y(x) are related. I remember that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is the reciprocal of log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as k. Then log_y(x) would be 1/k.

So, substituting into the first equation: x * k = 10. Equation one becomes x = 10 / k.

The second equation is 4y * (1/k) = 10. So, 4y = 10k, which simplifies to y = (10k)/4, or y = (5k)/2.

Now, I have expressions for x and y in terms of k:
x = 10/k
y = (5k)/2

But I also know that log_x(y) = k. Since x = 10/k and y = (5k)/2, I can write log_{10/k}((5k)/2) = k.

Wait, that looks complicated, but maybe I can express it using natural logarithms or change the base.

Recall that log_b(a) = ln(a)/ln(b). So, log_{10/k}((5k)/2) = ln((5k)/2) / ln(10/k).

Set that equal to k:
ln((5k)/2) / ln(10/k) = k.

Hmm, this seems like a complicated equation to solve for k. Maybe I can simplify it by letting t = k, so it's ln((5t)/2) / ln(10/t) = t.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express it as:

ln((5k/2)) = k * ln(10/k)

Let me compute both sides:

Left side: ln(5k/2) = ln(5k) - ln(2) = ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2)

Right side: k * ln(10/k) = k * (ln(10) - ln(k)) = k ln(10) - k ln(k)

So putting them together:

ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2) = k ln(10) - k ln(k)

Hmm, this looks a bit messy, but perhaps I can collect like terms.

Bring all terms to one side:

ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2) - k ln(10) + k ln(k) = 0

Let me rearrange:

[ln(5) - ln(2)] + [ln(k) -
