Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me first read it carefully and make sure I understand it.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, when N is divided by 1000, we get a quotient Q and a remainder R. We need to find Q + R.

Hmm. So, N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. It's the greatest such number with the given property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7.

Alright, let me break this down.

First, let's consider N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A being from 1 to 9, and B, C, D from 0 to 9.

The condition is that if we change any single digit (regardless of which one) to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, for example, changing A to 1: 1BCD must be divisible by 7. Similarly, changing B to 1: A1CD must be divisible by 7. Same for C and D.

Since N is the greatest such number, I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards and look for the largest N that satisfies this condition.

But wait, before jumping into checking each number, maybe there's a smarter way to approach this. Let's think about the properties.

When you change a digit to 1, the number becomes divisible by 7. So, for each digit position, changing that digit to 1 must result in a number that's 0 mod 7.

So, for the thousands place: Changing A to 1 gives 1BCD. So, 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, for the hundreds place: Changing B to 1 gives A1CD. So, A1CD ≡ 0 mod 7.

For the tens place: Changing C to 1 gives AB1D. So, AB1D ≡ 0 mod 7.

And for the ones place: Changing D to 1 gives ABC1. So, ABC1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, we have four conditions:

1. 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7
2. A1CD ≡ 0 mod 7
3. AB1D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. ABC1 ≡ 0 mod 7

But we also know that N = ABCD, and we want the greatest such N. So, perhaps we can model this mathematically.

Let me express each condition in terms of N's digits.

First, let me write N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Similarly, the four modified numbers can be expressed as:

1. 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D
2. 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D
3. 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1

Each of these must be divisible by 7.

So, let me denote the original number as N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, N is congruent to some value mod 7. Let's denote N mod 7 as r, so N ≡ r mod 7.

But each modified number is N with one digit changed. So, for each modified number, it's N minus the original digit in that place, plus 1 in that place.

For example, the first modified number (changing A to 1) is N - (1000A) + 1000*1.

Wait: Let's see:

Original N: 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Changing A to 1: 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = N - 1000A + 1000*1.

Similarly, changing B to 1: N - 100B + 100*1.

Changing C to 1: N - 10C + 10*1.

Changing D to 1: N - D + 1.

So each modified number is N minus the original digit in a particular place, plus 1 in that place.

Since each modified number must be divisible by 7, for each modified number M, M ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which means, for each position, N - original_digit * (place_value) + 1 * (place_value) ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, N + (1 - original_digit) * (place_value) ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, for each position, N ≡ (original_digit - 1) * (place_value) mod 7.

Hmm, that's interesting. So, for each digit position, N must be congruent to (digit -1)*place_value mod 7.

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the modified number M is N - original_digit * place_value + 1 * place_value.

So, M = N + (1 - original_digit) * place_value.

And M ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, N + (1 - original_digit) * place_value ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which rearranged is N ≡ (original_digit - 1) * place_value mod 7.

So, for each digit, N ≡ (digit -1) * place_value mod 7.

So, for each digit position, we have:

1. For thousands place (A): N ≡ (A - 1)*1000 mod 7
2. For hundreds place (B): N ≡ (B - 1)*100 mod 7
3. For tens place (C): N ≡ (C - 1)*10 mod 7
4. For ones place (D): N ≡ (D - 1)*1 mod 7

So, we have four congruences that N must satisfy.

But wait, N is a single number, so all four congruences must hold at the same time.

So, N must satisfy all four of these congruences.

Let me compute each place_value mod 7, because modular arithmetic can be simplified with mod 7.

Compute 1000 mod 7: 1000 ÷ 7 is 142 *7 = 994, 1000 - 994 =6. So 1000 ≡6 mod7.

100 mod7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2. So 100 ≡2 mod7.

10 mod7=3, since 7*1=7, 10
