Okay, so I've got this problem here about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, with a length of 16. Each path can only move along the grid lines, so that means each step is either right or up. The catch is that these paths should change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that in grid path problems, the number of steps is determined by the grid size. Since it's an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left (0,0) to the upper right (8,8), you need to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So, each path is a sequence of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U), arranged in some order. The total number of such paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But we have a restriction here: exactly four direction changes.

Wait, direction changes. So, what's a direction change? Each time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, for example, if you have a bunch of rights followed by a bunch of ups, that's one change. If you alternate R and U each step, that's 16 changes, but that's probably not the case here.

Now, the problem says exactly four direction changes. So, how does that structure the path? Let me think. Each direction change is a switch from R to U or U to R. So, if there are four changes, that would split the path into five segments, right? Because each change starts a new segment. Wait, no. Let me think again. If you start going right, that's the first segment, then a change to up is the second segment, then another change to right is the third, etc. So four changes would create five segments.

But the direction alternates each time, so the number of segments would be four plus one. But it's possible that the starting direction could be either right or up, so we have two cases: starting with R or starting with U.

Let me think about this. If a path starts with R and has four direction changes, it will have five segments, alternating R, U, R, U, etc. Similarly, if it starts with U, it will alternate U, R, U, R, etc. So, regardless of starting direction, after four changes, there are five segments.

Now, each of these segments must consist of at least one step, right? Because you can't have a segment with zero steps; otherwise, it wouldn't be a segment. So, when you split the 8 rights and 8 ups into five segments, each segment must have at least one step.

But wait, starting direction. Let's say the path starts with R. Then the segments go R, U, R, U, R. So, in this case, the number of R segments is three, and U segments is two? Wait, no, wait. Let's see
