Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF. All opposite sides are parallel, and when you extend the sides AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. The goal is to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, I remember that in a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, it's called a "parallelogon." Or maybe not exactly, but similar properties. Since all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, each pair of opposite sides must be congruent as well, but wait, no, wait, in a regular hexagon all sides are equal, but here it's only equilateral, not necessarily regular. So opposite sides are parallel and equal in length because it's equilateral, right? Because in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel, so maybe the same idea applies here.

Wait, but a hexagon is more complex. So if ABCDEF is a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, then AB is parallel and equal to ED, BC parallel and equal to FE, and CD parallel and equal to AF. Hmm, wait, but the hexagon is labeled in order, so AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA. So opposite sides would be AB and DE, BC and EF, CD and FA? Or maybe I got that wrong. Let me think.

Wait, in a regular hexagon, each pair of opposite sides are parallel and equal. So in order, AB is opposite to DE, BC opposite to EF, and CD opposite to FA. So in this case, AB || DE, BC || EF, CD || FA.

So in this problem, the hexagon is equilateral, so all sides are equal length, say, 's.' But opposite sides are also parallel. So each pair of opposite sides are equal and parallel, but the angles between sides can vary, making it non-regular but equilateral.

Now, the problem mentions that the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. So, these extensions of AB, CD, EF meet to form a triangle.

I need to visualize this. Let me try to sketch a rough diagram mentally. So, imagine the hexagon ABCDEF. Since it's convex, all the internal angles are less than 180 degrees. Extending AB, CD, EF. AB is one side, CD is another, EF is the third. When you extend these three, they form a triangle. So each pair of these extensions must meet at a point, forming the triangle.

So, the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300. Let me denote the triangle as T with sides 200, 240, 300. The sides of T correspond to the extensions of AB, CD, EF, so each side of T is an extension beyond the hexagon.

Wait, but how exactly? Let me try to think about how the extensions of AB, CD, EF form a triangle.

Imagine the hexagon is in the plane. If I extend AB beyond A and B, CD beyond C and D, and EF beyond E and F, these three extended lines
