Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on the same straight line. Also, all four points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. So, rectangle ABCD has sides AB = 107 and BC = 16. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so AD = BC = 16 and DC = AB = 107. Rectangle EFGH has sides FG = 17 and EF = 184. So, FG is one side and EF is another. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so EH = FG = 17 and GH = EF = 184.

Now, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine the line DC (which is 107 units long) and line EF (184 units) being placed in such a way that D and C are on one end, and E and F are on another. Wait, but how exactly are they arranged? Are these rectangles adjacent or overlapping?

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting. So, these four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. That must mean something because cyclic quadrilaterals have certain properties, like the sum of opposite angles is 180 degrees.

Let me try to draw a rough sketch in my mind. Rectangle ABCD: let's say A is top-left, B is top-right, C is bottom-right, D is bottom-left. Rectangle EFGH: maybe E is somewhere along the line DC, so maybe E is to the right of D, and F is to the right of E? Or perhaps E is to the left of D?

Wait, but D, E, C, F are collinear. So, D and C are two points on the line, and E and F are somewhere else on that same line. So, the order could be D-E-F-C or D-F-E-C, but not sure yet.

Wait, another thought: since ABCD is a rectangle, AD and BC are vertical sides, and AB and DC are horizontal sides. So, DC is 107 units long. Similarly, EF is 184, which is a side of the other rectangle.

Since E and F are on the same line as D and C, we can think of this line as the x-axis, maybe. Let's set up a coordinate system to make it easier.

Let me assign coordinates to the points. Letâ€™s place point D at the origin (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point C would be at (107, 0). Point A would be at (0,16), and point B at (107,16). Now, rectangle E
