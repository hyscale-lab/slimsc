Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These points form a triangle, I think. The problem mentions the family F of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment from the x-axis to the y-axis, length 1, in the first quadrant. 

Then, there's a unique point C on AB, not being A or B, that isn't on any of these segments PQ except for AB itself. I need to find OC² and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.

Alright, so first, I should probably sketch this out to visualize. O is the origin, A is halfway to (1,0), and B is a bit up the y-axis, since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. So AB is a line from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). That looks like a line in the first quadrant.

The family F consists of all segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and PQ is of length 1. So for any point P on the x-axis, say (a,0), the point Q would be somewhere on the y-axis such that the distance between P and Q is 1. Since it's in the first quadrant, a and the y-coordinate of Q are positive.

Let me think about the equation of such a PQ segment. If P is (a,0) and Q is (0,b), then the distance between them is sqrt(a² + b²) = 1. So a² + b² =1. But since both a and b are positive, this is the equation of the unit circle in the first quadrant. So each PQ is a line segment from a point (a,0) to (0,b) on the axes, forming a right triangle with legs a and b, and hypotenuse 1.

Wait, but F is the family of all such segments PQ. So each PQ is the line segment between (a,0) and (0,b) where a² + b² =1.

Now, the point C is on AB, not A or B, and it doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is part of F, since if we take P=A and Q=B, but wait, A is (1/2,0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the distance between A and B: sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) =1. So yes, AB is a segment in F, since it's of unit length and connects points on the axes.

So, AB is in F, and C is a point on AB that isn't on any other segment from F. So, for C, the only segment from F that contains it is AB. So, C must be such that if you tried to connect any other P to Q (with PQ of length 1), C wouldn't lie on that segment.

I need to find such a point C on AB and then compute OC².

How to approach this? Maybe parameterize AB, then find the point C such that the only PQ segment that passes through it is AB itself.

So first, let's parameterize AB. The line AB goes from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The parametric equations can be written as:

x = 1/2 - (1/2)t
y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2) t

where t ranges from 0 to 1. When t=0, we're at A, and t=1, we're at B.

So, any point C on AB can be written as (1/2 - (1/2)t, (sqrt(3)/2)t). Let me denote this as C = (x, y) where x = 1/2 - (1/2)t and y = (sqrt(3)/2)t.

Now, I need to find t such that C doesn't lie on any other segment PQ in F, except for AB.

So, for other segments PQ in F, which are from (a,0) to (0,b) with a² + b² =1, does the point C lie on PQ?

If so, then C would be on another segment, which we don't want. So, we need to find the point C where this doesn't happen, except for AB.

So, suppose that C is on another segment PQ. Then, there exists some a and b with a² + b²=1, such that C lies on PQ. We want to ensure that this is not possible except for AB.

So, let's find the condition for C to lie on PQ. The line PQ can be written as x/a + y/b =1, since it connects (a,0) to (0,b).

So, substituting point C into this equation:

x/a + y/b =1.

But since a² + b² =1, we have a relation between a and b.

So, C lies on PQ if x/a + y/b =1 and a² + b²=1.

We can think of this as a system of equations:

1. x/a + y/b =1

2. a² + b² =1

We can solve for a and b given x and y.

But since we want that the only solution is when PQ is AB itself, we need that the system has only one solution, which is a=1/2 and b=sqrt(3)/2. But wait, in fact, for C on AB, when PQ is AB, then a=1/2 and b=sqrt(3)/2, which satisfies a² + b²=1.

So, we need that for the point C, the system x/a + y/b=1 and a² + b²=1 has only the solution a=1/2, b=sqrt(3)/2.

Otherwise, if there exists another a and b satisfying both equations, then C would lie on another PQ, which we don't want.

So, to find C such that the system has only one solution, which is a=1/2, b=sqrt(3)/2.

So, let's see. For a given C=(x,y), the system is:

1. x/a + y/b =1

2. a² + b²=1

We can think of this as equations in variables a and b. For the system to have only the solution a=1/2, b=sqrt(3)/2, the two equations must be dependent only at that point.

Alternatively, perhaps the system has a unique solution when the point C is such that the equations are tangent to each other in some way.

Wait, maybe we can approach this by treating a and b as variables, and considering the system:

x/a + y/b =1

a² + b²=1

We can try to solve for a and b.

Let me rearrange the first equation:

x/a + y/b =1 => multiply both sides by ab:

x b + y a = a b

So, x b + y a = a b => a b - y a -x b =0 => a (b - y) -x b =0

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me express b in terms of a from the first equation.

From x/a + y/b =1, let's solve for b:

y/b =1 - x/a => y/b = (a - x)/a => b = y a / (a -x )

Then, plug this into the second equation a² + b²=1:

a² + (y² a²)/(a -x)^2 =1

Let me write this as:

a² [1 + (y²)/(a -x)^2] =1

This is a bit messy, but perhaps we can write it as:

a² ( (a -x)^2 + y² ) / (a -x)^2 ) =1

Thus,

a² ( (a -x)^2 + y² ) = (a -x)^2

Multiply both sides by (a -x)^2:

a² [ (a -x)^2 + y² ] = (a -x)^2

Bring everything to one side:

a² [ (a -x)^2 + y² ] - (a -x)^2 =0

Factor out (a -x)^2:

(a -x)^2 (a² -1 ) + a² y² =0

Wait, wait. Let me check that step again.

Wait, expanding:

Left side: a²(a -x)^2 + a² y² - (a -x)^2 =0

Factor (a -x)^2:

(a -x)^2 (a² -1) + a² y² =0

So,

(a -x)^2 (a² -1) + a² y² =0

Hmm, this is a quartic equation in a, which might be complicated. But perhaps if we look for conditions when this equation has only one solution at a=1/2.

Wait, but the original problem states that the point C is on AB, so for C=(x,y), it's on AB, which is parameterized by t as (1/2 - (1/2) t, (sqrt{3}/2) t). So, x=1/2 - (1/2)t, y= sqrt(3)/2 t.

So, let's substitute x and y in terms of t.

So, x = 1/2 - (1/2) t

y = (sqrt(3)/2) t

So, let's express the equation (a -x)^2 (a² -1) + a² y² =0 in terms of t.

First, compute (a -x)^2:

a -x = a - [1/2 - (1/2) t] = a -1/2 + (1/2) t

So, (a -x)^2 = [a -1/2 + (1/2) t]^2

Similarly, y^2 = [ (sqrt(3)/2) t ]^2 = (3/4) t²

Now, the equation becomes:

[ a -1/2 + (1/2) t ]^2 (a² -1) + a² (3/4) t² = 0

This is a bit complicated, but perhaps we can find t such that this equation only holds when a=1/2.

Because for point C, when a=1/2, the point is on AB, which is allowed. But if there exists another a where this equation holds, then C is on another PQ, which we need to avoid.

So, we need conditions on t such that the quartic equation in a has only one real root a=1/2.

One way to ensure that is that when we substitute a=1/2, the equation equals zero, and the derivative with respect to a is also zero. Then, a=1/2 would be a double root, but maybe that's not sufficient. Alternatively, perhaps the equation reduces to (a -1/2)^2 times some expression, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe we can think of the system as a quadratic in a. Let's see.

Wait, let's try to substitute x and y in terms of t into the equation. So, substituting x = 1/2 - (1/2) t and y = sqrt(3)/2 t, and then plugging into the equation:

x/a + y/b =1 and a² + b²=1.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize a and b in terms of an angle. Since a² + b²=1, we can write a = cos θ, b = sin θ, where θ is between 0 and π/2.

Then, the equation x/a + y/b =1 becomes:

x / cos θ + y / sin θ =1

So, for each θ, this is a line in the (x, y) plane.

But in our problem, (x, y) is on AB, so it's parameterized by t. So, for which t does the equation x / cos θ + y / sin θ =1 have a solution θ, except for θ corresponding to AB.

Wait, but AB is when a=1/2, b=sqrt(3)/2, which corresponds to θ=60 degrees, because cos θ =1/2, sin θ= sqrt(3)/2. So θ=60°, which is π/3 radians.

So, for point C on AB, the equation x / cos θ + y / sin θ =1 must have θ=π/3 as the only solution. Otherwise, C lies on another PQ.

So, if we can find t such that the equation x / cos θ + y / sin θ =1 has θ=π/3 as the only solution, then C is unique.

But how to find such t?

Alternatively, perhaps we can find t such that the equation x / cos θ + y / sin θ =1 is satisfied only when θ=π/3.

Let me substitute x and y in terms of t.

So,

x = 1/2 - (1/2) t

y = (sqrt(3)/2) t

So, plugging into the equation:

[1/2 - (1/2) t] / cos θ + [ (sqrt(3)/2) t ] / sin θ =1

Let me denote this as:

[ (1 - t)/2 ] / cos θ + [ sqrt(3) t / 2 ] / sin θ =1

Multiply both sides by 2:

(1 - t)/cos θ + (sqrt(3) t)/ sin θ =2

Let me write this as:

(1 - t) sec θ + sqrt(3) t csc θ =2

This is an equation in θ. We need that this equation holds only when θ=π/3.

But how can we ensure that?

I think that if the equation has only θ=π/3 as a solution, then for this specific t, the equation is satisfied only at θ=π/3, and not for any other θ.

Alternatively, perhaps when the equation is tangent to the curve defined by the other equation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of this as an equation in θ, and then find the condition for which θ=π/3 is the only solution.

Wait, let's plug θ=π/3 into the equation and see what t must be.

At θ=π/3, cos θ=1/2, sin θ=sqrt(3)/2.

So,

Left-hand side (LHS) becomes:

(1 - t)/(1/2) + (sqrt(3) t)/(sqrt(3)/2) = 2(1 - t) + 2 t = 2 - 2t + 2t = 2

Which equals the right-hand side (RHS)=2. So, θ=π/3 is always a solution, regardless of t. So, that makes sense because point C is on AB, which is PQ with θ=π/3.

But we need that for this particular t, θ=π/3 is the only solution.

So, when would the equation (1 - t)/cos θ + (sqrt(3) t)/ sin θ =2 have only θ=π/3 as a solution?

One way this could happen is if the function f(θ) = (1 - t)/cos θ + (sqrt(3) t)/ sin θ -2 has only one root at θ=π/3.

To ensure that, perhaps f(θ) has a double root at θ=π/3, meaning that the derivative f’(θ) is also zero at θ=π/3.

So, compute f(θ)=0 and f’(θ)=0 at θ=π/3.

Let me compute f(θ):

f(θ) = (1 - t)/cos θ + (sqrt(3) t)/ sin θ - 2

Compute f’(θ):

f’(θ) = (1 - t) sin θ / cos² θ - (sqrt(3) t cos θ)/ sin² θ

At θ=π/3:

cos θ=1/2, sin θ=sqrt(3)/2

So,

f’(π/3) = (1 - t) (sqrt(3)/2) / (1/2)^2 - (sqrt(3) t (1/2)) / (sqrt(3)/2)^2

Simplify each term:

First term: (1 - t)(sqrt(3)/2) / (1/4) = (1 - t)(sqrt(3)/2) * 4 = 2 sqrt(3)(1 - t)

Second term: (sqrt(3) t (1/2)) / (3/4) = (sqrt(3) t /2 ) * (4/3) = (2 sqrt(3) t)/3

So,

f’(π/3) = 2 sqrt(3)(1 - t) - (2 sqrt(3) t)/3

Factor out 2 sqrt(3):
