Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that when dealing with equations involving sums and products of variables, sometimes we can use symmetric expressions or look for patterns. The first condition is a linear equation, and the second one is a cubic expression. Maybe there's a way to relate them.

Let me write down the two equations again:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Looking at the second equation, I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. For example, a²b and a²c. Maybe I can factor something out here. Let me see:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the entire expression can be rewritten as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that looks better. Now, since I know that a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c), (a + c), and (a + b) in terms of the other variables. Specifically:

b + c = 300 - a
a + c = 300 - b
a + b = 300 - c

Substituting these into the expression gives:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Let me expand each term:

a²(300) - a³ + b²(300) - b³ + c²(300) - c³ = 6,000,000

Factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, okay. So I have an equation in terms of a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³. Maybe I can find another relation that connects these terms.

I remember that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). We know a + b + c is 300, so:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac)
90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac)

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ac, and R = abc. Also, another identity comes to mind: a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc. So:

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SQ + 3R

So putting it back into the second equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (S³ - 3SQ + 3R) = 6,000,000

We know S is 300, so S³ is 300^3 = 27,000,000. Also, 300(a² + b² + c²) can be expressed in terms of Q. From the earlier equation:

a² + b² + c² = S² - 2Q = 90,000 - 2Q

So substituting that in:

300*(90,000 - 2Q) - (27,000,000 - 3*300*Q + 3R) = 6,000,000

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 300*90,000 - 300*2Q = 27,000,000 - 600Q

Next, the expression inside the parentheses: 27,000,000 - 3*300*Q + 3R. 3*300 is 900, so that's 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3R.

Putting it all together:

27,000,000 - 600Q - (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3R) = 6,000,000

Simplify the left side:

27,000,000 - 600Q -27,000,000 + 900Q -3R = 6,000,000

The 27,000,000 and -27,000,000 cancel out. Then, (-600Q + 900Q) gives 300Q. So:

300Q -3R = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100Q - R = 2,000,000

So now we have another equation: 100Q - R = 2,000,000.

But earlier, from the expansion of (a + b + c)^2, we had:

90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2Q

And since a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2Q, that's consistent. So now, I have:

100Q - R = 2,000,000 --> Equation (1)
And from (a + b + c)^2 = 90,000, so Q is related to a² + b² + c².

But I need another equation to relate Q and R. Wait, perhaps I can use the original equations to get something else.

Alternatively, maybe express R in terms of Q from Equation (1):

R = 100Q - 2,000,000

So R is expressed in terms of Q. Now, since Q is ab + bc + ac, and R is abc, perhaps I can find integer solutions for a, b, c such that these hold.

But how? Maybe let's consider that a, b, c are non-negative integers, so Q and R must also be integers. But 100Q - R = 2,000,000, so R is 100Q minus 2,000,000.

But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful. Let me think about possible symmetric cases or how the variables might be arranged.

Suppose two of the variables are equal, say a = b. Then maybe I can find some symmetry. Alternatively, maybe all three variables are equal, but let's check that case first.

If a = b = c, then each would be 100 because 3*100 = 300. Let's see if that satisfies the second equation.

Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Since a = b = c = 100, each term is 100² * 100 = 100³ = 1,000,000. There are six terms, so total is 6,000,000. Perfect, so (100, 100, 100) is a solution.

But are there other solutions? The problem asks for the number of triples, so maybe this is the only solution? Or are there more?

Wait, maybe there are other triples where two variables are equal and the third is different. Let's try that.

Let me suppose that a = b, and c is different. Then, since a + b + c = 300, we have 2a + c = 300, so c = 300 - 2a.

Now, let's compute Q = ab + bc + ac. Since a = b, this becomes a² + a c + a c = a² + 2a c.

Similarly, c = 300 - 2a, so Q = a² + 2a(300 - 2a) = a² + 600a - 4a² = -3a² + 600a.

Similarly, R = a b c = a² c = a² (300 - 2a) = 300a² - 2a³.

From Equation (1): 100Q - R = 2,000,000.

Substitute Q and R:

100*(-3a² + 600a) - (300a² - 2a³) = 2,000,000

Expand:

-300a² + 60,000a - 300a² + 2a³ = 2,000,000

Combine like terms:

2a³ - 600a² + 60,000a = 2,000,000

Divide both sides by 2:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a = 1,000,000

Bring 1,000,000 to the left:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0

Hmm, that's a cubic equation. Let me see if I can find integer roots. Let's try small integer values for a.

But wait, a can't be more than 150, because c = 300 - 2a has to be non-negative. So a ≤ 150.

Let me try a = 100, which was our earlier case. Plugging in:

100³ -300*(100)^2 +30,000*100 -1,000,000 = 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 +3,000,000 -1,000,000 = 0. Yep, works.

What about a = 0? Then:

0 -0 +0 -1,000,000 = -1,000,000 ≠0.

a=100 is a root, but are there others?

We can factor (a - 100) from the cubic equation.

Let me perform polynomial division or factorization.

Let me write the equation as a³ - 300a² +30,000a -1,000,000 =0.

Factor (a - 100):

Using synthetic division:

Divide a³ -300a² +30,000a -1,000,000 by (a -100).

100 | 1   -300    30,000    -1,000,000

          100    -20,000      1,000,000

      -------------------------------

        1   -200    10,000          0

So the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a² - 200a + 10,000).

Now, set the quadratic equal to zero:

a² -200a +10,000 =0

Compute discriminant D = (200)^2 -4*1*10,000 =40,000 -40,000=0.

So there's a repeated root at a = [200 ±0]/2 =100.

So the equation has a triple root at a=100. So the only solution when a = b is a=100, which gives c=300-2*100=100. So this is the same as the case where all three are equal. So no new solutions here.

Hmm, so maybe the only solution is when all three are equal? But wait, maybe in the case where all three are not equal, but perhaps two are zero?

Wait, let me consider another case where one variable is zero. Let's say c=0. Then the equations become a + b =300 and a²b + b²a +0+0+0+0 =6,000,000.

So a²b +ab² =6,000,000.

Factor ab(a + b) =6,000,000. Since a + b=300, this gives ab *300 =6,000,000.

So ab=6,000,000 /300=20,000.

So ab=20,000, and a + b=300.

So now, we have a and b are non-negative integers such that a + b=300 and ab=20,000.

We can write this as solving for a and b where they are roots of the quadratic equation x² -300x +20,000=0.

Let me compute the discriminant D=300² -4*1*20,000=90,000 -80,000=10,000.

Square root of 10,000 is 100. So the solutions are [300 ±100]/2.

So (300+100)/2=400/2=200, and (300-100)/2=200/2=100.

So a=200, b=100, or a=100, b=200. So c=0.

Thus, when c=0, we have two triples: (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). But wait, since a, b, c are non-negative integers, and the problem counts ordered triples, so each permutation where one is zero and the other two are 200 and 100 would be distinct.

Wait, but in this case, since c=0, and a and b are 200 and100, but when c=0, the triples are (200,100,0), (100,200,0), and (200,0,100), etc. Wait, no, because we set c=0, so a and b can vary. So for each permutation where one variable is zero, we might have multiple solutions.

Wait, hold on, in this case, when c=0, a and b are 200 and 100. So the triple is (200,100,0), but since the variables are ordered, (200,100,0), (200,0,100), (100,200,0), (100,0,200), (0,200,100), (0,100,200). But wait, will all these satisfy the equation?

Wait no, because when we set c=0, we derived a specific a and b. So if I set a=200, b=100, c=0, that's one triple. But if I set a=100, b=200, c=0, that's another. Similarly, if I set a=200, c=100, b=0, that would be another case where another variable is zero. But wait, in each case, only one variable is zero, and the other two are 200 and 100. So the number of such triples would be 3 (choices for which variable is zero) multiplied by 2 (since the other two can be arranged in two ways).

So that gives 3*2=6 triples where one variable is zero, another is 200, and the third is 100.

Wait, but let me confirm if these triples satisfy the original equation.

Take (200,100,0):

Compute a + b + c = 200 +100 +0=300. Good.

Compute a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b.

a²b=200²*100=40,000*100=4,000,000

a²c=200²*0=0

b²a=100²*200=10,000*200=2,000,000

b²c=100²*0=0

c²a=0²*200=0

c²b=0²*100=0

Adding these: 4,000,000 +0 +2,000,000 +0 +0 +0=6,000,000. Perfect.

Similarly, (100,200,0) would give the same result because it's symmetric.

So each of these 6 triples works.

But wait, earlier when I considered a = b = c =100, that was another solution. So now we have at least 7 solutions: the one where all are 100, and the 6 where one is zero, one is 200, and one is 100.

But wait, in the case where a = b = c =100, all variables are non-zero, so that's a distinct case. So up to now, we have 7 solutions.

But are there more cases where none of the variables are zero, but some are different?

Alternatively, maybe the only solutions are these 7? Or perhaps more.

Wait, let's think about it. So far, we have:

1. (100,100,100)

And the 6 permutations of (200,100,0).

Are there other triples where none are zero, but variables are different?

Let me assume that none of a, b, c are zero, and they are all distinct.

Let me suppose that a, b, c are all different and non-zero. Then, maybe we can try to find other solutions.

But this might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe the only possible solutions are the ones we found.

Wait, let's consider another case where two variables are zero. Let's say b = c =0. Then, a=300. Then compute the second equation:

a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b = a²*0 +a²*0 +0 +0 +0 +0=0, which is not 6,000,000. So that's invalid. So two variables being zero doesn't work.

What about another case, say
