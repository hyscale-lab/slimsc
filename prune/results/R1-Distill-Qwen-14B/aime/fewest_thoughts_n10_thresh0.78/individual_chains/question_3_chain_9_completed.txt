Okay, so I need to solve this probability problem about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand it step by step.

First, Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. The question is about the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay, so this is a conditional probability problem. I remember that the formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize.

But wait, if she won the grand prize, that means all four of her numbers were chosen. That definitely means she also won a prize because she has four correct numbers, which is more than two. So, A is a subset of B. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, the conditional probability P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to find P(A), the probability that Jen wins the grand prize, and P(B), the probability that she wins at least two numbers.

Let me calculate P(A) first. The grand prize is when all four of her numbers are selected. The total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from S is C(10,4), which is 210.

The number of favorable outcomes for A is just 1 because Jen has picked a specific set of four numbers, and only one such set exists. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.

Now, P(B) is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, it's easier to calculate the probability of the complement event and subtract it from 1. The complement of B is that fewer than two of her numbers are chosen, meaning zero or one of her numbers are selected.

Let me compute the number of ways where none of her numbers are selected. Since she has 4 numbers, the remaining numbers in S are 6. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from these 6 is C(6,4) = 15.

Next, the number of ways where exactly one of her numbers is chosen. We choose 1 number from her 4, and the other 3 from the remaining 6. So that's C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4 * 20 = 80.

So, the total number of ways where she doesn't win a prize (i.e., less than two numbers chosen) is 15 + 80 = 95.

Therefore, the number of ways she does win a prize is the total number of possible 4-number combinations minus 95. That's C(10,4) - 95 = 210 - 95 = 115.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, the number of ways she can have at least two correct is the sum of combinations where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four numbers are chosen. But since we have the complement, it's easier to subtract.

So, P(B) = (115) / 210.

Wait, but let me compute this again. The total number of possible 4-number combinations is 210. The number of combinations where less than two of Jen's numbers are chosen is C(6,4) + C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 15 + 80 = 95.

So, the number of combinations where at least two of her numbers are chosen is 210 - 95 = 115. So, yes, P(B) is 115/210.

Simplify that fraction: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 ÷5 = 23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42.

So, P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 23/42. Therefore, P(A|B) = (1/210) / (23/42).

Let me compute that.

First, 1/210 divided by 23/42 is the same as (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23).

Simplify 42/210: 42 divides into 210 exactly 5 times (42*5=210). So, 42/210 = 1/5.

So, now we have (1/5) / 23 = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, that can't be right because 42/210 is 1/5, so (1/210)*(42/23) = (1/5)*(1/23) = 1/115.

Wait, but that seems low. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, P(A) is 1/210.

P(B) is 115/210, which is 23/42.

So, P(A|B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = (1/210)*(210/115) )= 1/115.

Hmm, so the probability is 1/115, which simplifies to m/n = 1/115.

Wait, are 1 and 115 relatively prime? Yes, because 115 factors into 5*23, and 1 shares no common factors with 115 except 1.

So, m=1 and n=115, so m + n=1+115=116.

Wait, so the answer is 116.

But let me think again. Did I make any mistake in the calculation?

Wait, another approach: the number of favorable outcomes for A is 1, as she has exactly one combination of four numbers.

The number of favorable outcomes for B is 115, as calculated.

So, the conditional probability is the number of ways A can happen divided by the number of ways B can happen. That is, 1 / 115.

Which gives 1/115, which is what I got before.

So, seems correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is: given that at least two of her numbers are chosen, what's the probability that all four are chosen.

So, we can think of it as, given that in the 4 chosen numbers, at least two are from Jen's 4, what's the chance that all four are from hers.

So, possible scenarios:

- Exactly 2, 3, or 4 of Jen's numbers are in the chosen set.

The probability of each scenario is the number of combinations for each case divided by the total combinations, which is the same as P(B).

So, number of ways to have exactly 2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15=90.

Number of ways to have exactly 3: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24.

Number of ways to have exactly 4: 1.

So, total number of ways in B is 90 + 24 +1 = 115.

So, the number of favorable cases for A is 1.

Therefore, the conditional probability is 1/115.

So, same result.

Therefore, the probability is 1/115, which simplifies to 1/115, so m=1, n=115, m + n=116.

Wait, but 1 and 115 are coprime, correct.

Yes, 115 is 5*23, and 1 has no common divisors except 1.

So, the answer is 116.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{116}


Jen enters a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \). Four numbers are randomly chosen from \( S \). She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. We need to find the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize, expressed as \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are relatively prime, and then find \( m + n \).

First, we calculate the probability of winning the grand prize \( P(A) \). The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \). The number of favorable outcomes for winning the grand prize is 1, so \( P(A) = \frac{1}{210} \).

Next, we calculate the probability of winning a prize \( P(B) \). This is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. We use the complement rule: the number of ways to choose fewer than two of her numbers is the sum of choosing 0 or 1 of her numbers. 

- Choosing 0 of her numbers: \( \binom{6}{4} = 15 \)
- Choosing 1 of her numbers: \( \binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \)

The total number of ways to choose fewer than two of her numbers is \( 15 + 80 = 95 \). Therefore, the number of ways to choose at least two of her numbers is \( 210 - 95 = 115 \). Thus, \( P(B) = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42} \).

The conditional probability \( P(A|B) \) is given by:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115}
\]

Since 1 and 115 are relatively prime, we have \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{116}
\]
