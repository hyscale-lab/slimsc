Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and it's a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe if I visualize it, it'll make more sense.

Alright, the problem says we have a 5x5 grid, which is like a chessboard with 25 cells. We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable except for their color. The task is to place some of these chips in the grid under certain conditions.

First condition: Each cell can have at most one chip. So no cell can have more than one chip. That's straightforward.

Second condition: All chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must also be the same color. Hmm, okay. So in any given row, if there are chips, they all have to be white or all black. Same thing for each column.

Third condition: Any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions. So the configuration we come up with must be such that if we try to add another chip, it would either cause a row or column to have mixed colors or exceed the one-chip-per-cell rule.

Wait, but the problem says "some of these chips," so we don't necessarily have to use all 50 chips. We can use any number, as long as the conditions are satisfied.

So, I need to find the number of ways to place some chips in the grid following those rules.

Let me think about the structure here. Each row can either be all white, all black, or have no chips. Similarly, each column can be all white, all black, or empty. But the catch is that once a row or column is assigned a color, all the cells in that row or column must follow that color.

But wait, there's an additional constraint. If I have a row that's all white, then any column that intersects this row must either be all white or all black. Because if a column intersects a white row and has a black chip in another cell, that column would have mixed colors, which is not allowed.

So, let me consider the possible configurations of the grid. Since each row and column has to be monochromatic, maybe the entire grid can be thought of in terms of blocks of white and black regions.

Wait, this is starting to sound like a grid that's divided into rectangles, where each rectangle is either all white or all black. But since the rows and columns are all monochromatic, the only possible configurations are where the grid is a checkerboard pattern of larger blocks.

Alternatively, perhaps each row and column can be either white, black, or empty, but the interactions between rows and columns impose some structure.

Wait, no. Because if a row is white, then any column that has a chip in that row must also be white. Because otherwise, if the column had a black chip in another row, then the column would have both white and black chips, which is not allowed.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose I have a row that's all white. Then, each column that intersects this row must also be all white. Because if any of those columns had a black chip in another row, that column would have a white chip in this row and a black chip elsewhereâ€”violating the column condition. So, if a
