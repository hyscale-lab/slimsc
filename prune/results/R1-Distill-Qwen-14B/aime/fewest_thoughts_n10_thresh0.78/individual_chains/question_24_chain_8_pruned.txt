Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in a list. The list has some specific properties, so I need to figure out what the list looks like first. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, the properties of the list:

1. The sum of all the items is 30. So, whatever numbers are in the list, when I add them up, they should total 30.

2. The unique mode is 9. Mode means the number that appears most frequently. Since it's unique, no other number appears as many times as 9 does. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list.

3. The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself. Hmm, that's interesting. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. And this median isn't in the list. So, for example, if the list has an odd number of elements, the middle one is the median. But in this case, the median is some number that's not present even though the other elements are positive integers.

So, my goal is to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies all these properties and then compute the sum of their squares.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's consider the number of elements in the list. It could be either even or odd. The median's behavior depends on that. But since the median isn't present in the list, perhaps the list has an even number of elements? Because for an even-length list, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which might not be an integer. But wait, the median is specified as a positive integer, so if it's an average, it must be an integer. So, that suggests that the two middle numbers are either both even or both odd, so their average is an integer. But that integer doesn't appear in the list.

Alternatively, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, which is present in the list. But in this case, the median is not in the list. So that can't be. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements because only then the median is an average of two middle numbers, which might not be present in the list.

So, the list has even number of elements, let's say 2n. Then the median is the average of the nth and (n+1)th terms. Since it's an integer, the average must be an integer, so the two middle numbers must sum to an even number. So, both middle numbers are either even or odd.

Also, the median is a positive integer, so it's at least 1. Since the numbers are positive integers, the median must be at least 1.

Given that the median is not in the list, the two middle numbers must be such that their average is an integer that doesn't appear in the list. Hmm.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Determine the number of elements (let's call it k) in the list. Since the sum is
