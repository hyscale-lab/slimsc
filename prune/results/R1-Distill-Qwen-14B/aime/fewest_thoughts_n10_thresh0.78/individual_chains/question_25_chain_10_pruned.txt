Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents of Aimeville and what they own. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 900 residents. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's a given for everyone. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195 for diamond rings, 367 for golf clubs, and 562 for garden spades. 

Additionally, it tells me that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. I need to find how many own all four—like, all four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Since everyone owns the candy hearts, this is essentially the fourth thing they might own along with the others.

Hmm, okay. So, this seems like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that from set theory. The inclusion-exclusion principle helps calculate the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by considering all possible intersections. But wait, in this case, each person owns a candy heart, so that's kind of the universal set here. So, all the other ownerships are subsets of that.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Total residents, n(U) = 900.
- Ownership of diamond rings, D = 195.
- Ownership of golf clubs, G = 367.
- Ownership of garden spades, S = 562.
- Ownership of candy hearts, C = 900 (since everyone has it).
- Number of people owning exactly two things, exactly_two = 437.
- Number of people owning exactly three things, exactly_three = 234.
- We need to find the number owning all four, which is n(D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C). But since C is universal, this is the same as n(D ∩ G ∩ S).

Wait, maybe I should think of it as all four, but since C is already universal, it's automatically included. So, the people who own all four are exactly those who own D, G, S, and since they all have C, it's just the intersection of D, G, and S.

So, the problem reduces to finding n(D ∩ G ∩ S). 

But how do I relate this to the given numbers? Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets. The formula for three sets A, B, C is:

n(A ∪ B ∪ C) = n(A) + n(B) + n(C) - n(A∩B) - n(A∩C) - n(B∩C) + n(A∩B∩C)

But in our case, we have four sets, but one of them is universal. Wait, no, actually, the problem isn't about the union; it's about the overlaps. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem gives me the number of people owning exactly two
