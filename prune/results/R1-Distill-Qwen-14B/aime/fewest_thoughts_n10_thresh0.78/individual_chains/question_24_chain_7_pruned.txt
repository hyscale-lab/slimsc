Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the details.

The problem says there's a list of positive integers with three specific properties:

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

And the question is asking for the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, let's recall some definitions to make sure I'm on the right track.

- **Mode**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. The problem says it's a unique mode, which is 9. That means 9 appears more times than any other number in the list.
- **Median**: The median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. If there's an even number of items, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself. So, the median is some integer not present in the list, but it's the middle value.

Alright, so our list has to satisfy these three conditions. Let's think about how to construct such a list.

First, let's consider the mode. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear at least twice, and more than any other number. So, if we have other numbers, they can appear at most once or twice, but not more than the number of times 9 appears.

Next, the sum of all the numbers is 30. So, whatever list we come up with must add up to 30.

The median is a positive integer not in the list. So, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one, which isn't present, which is a bit confusing. Wait, maybe it's an even list? Because if it's an odd-length list, the median is one of the elements, but the problem says the median is not in the list. So, that can't be. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements because in that case, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which might not be in the list.

Wait, that's a key insight. So, the list must have an even number of elements because if it had an odd number, the median would be one of the elements, which would have to be a positive integer, but the problem states the median is a positive integer not in the list. Therefore, the list length must be even.

So, the list has even length. Let me note that down.

So, the list has an even number of elements, say 2n. Then, the median is the average of the nth and (n+1)th elements when sorted in order. So, the median is (a_n + a_{n+1}) / 2, which must be an integer, and this integer is not present in the list.

So, the median is an integer, so the sum of a_n and a_{n+1} must be even, which would make the median an integer. Also, this median is not present in the list.

Now, the mode is 9. So, 9 appears more times than any other number. Let's try to figure out the minimal number of times 9 has to appear.

If another number appears only once, then 9 needs to appear at least twice. But if another number appears twice, 9 has to appear at least three times, and so on. But to minimize the total sum, we probably want 9 to appear as few times as possible, so that the sum of other numbers is larger, but since the total sum is 30, maybe we can have 9 appearing twice, and other numbers appearing once or twice.

Wait, but if
