Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which makes sense because each path moves from the lower left to the upper right, so they must consist of 8 right and 8 up moves in some order. But the catch here is that the paths should change direction exactly four times. Hmm, I need to figure out how to model this.

First, let me make sure I understand what it means to change direction. Each time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, for example, a path that goes right, right, up, up, right, etc., would change direction each time it switches from right to up or up to right.

In a regular grid path without any restrictions, the number of paths is given by the binomial coefficient C(16,8), since we have 16 moves with 8 rights and 8 ups. But here, we have an additional constraint on the number of direction changes.

So, how do the direction changes relate to the structure of the path? Let's think about it. If a path changes direction exactly k times, it must alternate between right and up moves in some pattern. Each time it changes direction, it starts a new segment of consecutive moves in one direction.

Wait, so if we have exactly four direction changes, how many segments does that create? Let me see. Each direction change adds a new segment. Starting from the initial direction, each change adds one more segment. So, if we start with right, then the path would be right for some steps, then up for some steps, then right again, and so on. Each change adds a new segment.

But the number of segments would be one more than the number of direction changes. Because, for example, if you have 0 direction changes, you have 1 segment. If you have 1 direction change, you have 2 segments. So, for four direction changes, we should have five segments in total. Each segment is a consecutive run of rights or ups.

But wait, the grid is 8x8, so each path must have exactly 8 rights and 8 ups. So, we're looking to partition the 16 moves into five segments, with each segment being a consecutive run of rights or ups. Each segment must be of length at least 1, because you can't have a segment of length zero.

But also, the number of rights and ups in each segment must add up to 8. So, for example, if the first segment is all rights, the next could be all ups, and so on, alternating. Alternatively, the first segment could be ups, then rights, etc.

So, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the different ways to partition the 8 rights and 8 ups into these five segments, with the constraint that the direction alternates each time.

Wait, but direction alternates each time, so the number of segments for rights and ups will differ by at most one. Since we have five segments, which is an odd number, the number of right segments and up segments will be three and two, or two and three, depending on which direction we start with.

Let me think: If the path starts with a right move, then the segments will alternate between right and up. So, for five segments, the number of right segments will be three and up segments will be two. Similarly, if it starts with an up move, the right segments will be two and up segments will be three.

So, the number of right segments is either three or two, depending on the starting direction. Similarly for up segments.

But wait, each segment must consist of at least one move. So, for each direction, the number of segments is either three or two, but each of those segments has at least one move.

So, for the rights: if we have three right segments, then each can be thought of as partitioning 8 into three positive integers. Similarly, the ups would be partitioned into two positive integers if we start
