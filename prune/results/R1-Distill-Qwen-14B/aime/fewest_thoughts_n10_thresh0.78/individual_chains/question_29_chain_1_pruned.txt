Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and try to visualize what's going on.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they all lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. So, that's interestingâ€”they form a cyclic quadrilateral. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm. Let me start by drawing a rough sketch in my mind. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, AB and CD are 107 units long, and BC and AD are 16 units. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle, so EF and GH are 184 units, and FG and EH are 17 units.

Now, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, that line must pass through points D, E, C, F in that order, or some other order? Wait, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, but doesn't specify the order. Hmm, that's important. Let me think.

In rectangle ABCD, the order is A, B, C, D, right? So, AD is one side, DC is another. So, D is connected to C. If E is another point, and D, E, C, F are on a line, then perhaps that line is DC extended? Or is it another line?

Wait, since E is part of rectangle EFGH, which is another rectangle. So, EFGH has sides EF, FG, GH, HE. Since EF is 184 and FG is 17, that means the sides of EFGH are 184 and 17.

Let me try to figure out the positions. Maybe ABCD is above or below EFGH, but given that A, D, H, G lie on a circle, perhaps they are arranged in a way where AD and HG are sides that can form a cyclic quadrilateral.

Wait, cyclic quadrilateral. So, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That suggests that ADHG is a cyclic quadrilateral. So, let me think about the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. Opposite angles sum to 180 degrees, and the product of the diagonals relates to the sum of the products of opposite sides. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the power of a point or something related to circles. Hmm.

Let me think about the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates can help me solve this. Let's try that.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since ABCD is a rectangle, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (107,0) because DC is length AB which is 107. Then, since BC is 16, point B would be at (107,16), and point A would be at (0,16).

Now, EFGH is another rectangle. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. Let's see: since D is at (0,0) and C is at (107,0), the line DC is the x-axis from (0,0) to (107,0). But E and F are also on this line. So, E and F must lie somewhere on the x-axis.

Wait, but E is a vertex of rectangle EFGH. So, if E is on the x-axis, then the rectangle EFGH must have one side along the x-axis. Let me define E as (e,0) and F as (f,0). Since EFGH is a rectangle, and FG = 1
