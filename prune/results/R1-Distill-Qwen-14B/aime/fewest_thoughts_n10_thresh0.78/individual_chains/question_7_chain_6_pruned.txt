Okay, so I have this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, so each has a 50% chance of being red or blue. The question is asking for the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. They mention that the probability will be m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm. So, I need to figure out how many colorings allow such a rotation, and then divide that by the total number of possible colorings, which is 2^8 = 256, since each of the 8 vertices can be either red or blue.

Let me think about what it means for the octagon to be rotatable so that all blue vertices align with original red positions. That means there exists some rotation (by some number of steps) such that when we rotate the octagon, every blue vertex moves to a position that was previously red.

Wait, but the rotation could be by any number of steps, right? Since it's a regular octagon, the possible rotations are multiples of 45 degrees, which correspond to shifts of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 positions.

So, for each possible rotation (including the identity rotation, which does nothing), we need to check if, after applying that rotation, all the blue vertices are now on positions that were originally red. But wait, actually, the problem says that such a rotation exists, so maybe I need to count all colorings where at least one rotation satisfies this condition.

But that seems a bit tricky because colorings can satisfy this condition for multiple rotations. So, perhaps I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or Burnside's lemma to count the number of colorings fixed by some rotation.

Wait, Burnside's lemma is about the number of orbits, which might not directly apply here because we're not considering group actions on the colorings, but rather whether a coloring is fixed by any group element (rotation). Or maybe it does apply, let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the orbits of the colorings under the action of rotation. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256.

Now, let's consider the group of rotations of the octagon, which is the cyclic group C8 with 8 elements (rotations by 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째). Each rotation can be seen as a permutation of the vertices.

We need to find the number of colorings C such that there exists a rotation g where applying g to C results in all blue vertices being moved to positions that were originally red. So, in other words, for such a coloring C, when we rotate
