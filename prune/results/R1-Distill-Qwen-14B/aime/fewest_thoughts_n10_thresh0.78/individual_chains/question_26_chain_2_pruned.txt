Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in the triangle ABC. Let me try to visualize the problem first. 

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at points B and C to the circle ω intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. The sides of the triangle are given: AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. I need to find AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me jot down the given information:

- Triangle ABC with AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10.
- Circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC.
- Tangents at B and C meet at D.
- AD intersects ω again at P.
- Find AP.

First, I should probably draw a diagram to visualize everything. But since I don't have paper right now, I'll try to imagine it. So, triangle ABC with the given side lengths. The circle ω passes through all three points. Tangents at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole of BC with respect to ω. Then, line AD passes through the circle again at P.

I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole or the external homothetic center. Also, for two tangent points, the lengths from the external point to the points of tangency are equal. So, DB = DC because they're both tangents from D to ω.

Wait, is that true? Yes, because the two tangent segments from a single external point to a circle are equal in length. So, DB = DC.

So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Now, I need to find AP. Hmm. Maybe I can apply some theorem or use some properties here. Since points are involved on the circumcircle, perhaps power of a point could be useful.

Power of a point D with respect to circle ω: the power is equal to DB^2 (since DB is the tangent from D to ω). Similarly, it's also equal to DC^2, but since DB = DC, this makes sense.

So, power of D: DB^2 = DC^2 = DP * DA. Wait, no. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB^2, which is also equal to DC^2. Also, since AD passes through ω, the power of D is equal to DP * DA. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the power of a point D with respect to circle ω is equal to the product of the lengths from D to the two intersection points of any line through D and the circle. In this case, line AD intersects ω at A and P. So, power of D = DA * DP.

But also, power of D is DB^2 because DB is a tangent. So, DB^2 = DA * DP.

So, I can write DB^2 = DA * DP.

I need to find AP, which is PA = AD - AP? Wait, no, AP is from A to P, but P is on the circle, and AD passes through A and goes to D. So, AP is the segment from A to P on AD, whereas DA is the entire length from D to A. So, perhaps AP = PD - AD? Wait, no, that might not make sense.

Wait, actually, let's denote AP as x, then PD would be the length from P to D. Since A is outside the circle, and P is the other intersection point on AD, then AD is split into two parts: AP and PD. So, AD = AP + PD. Therefore,
