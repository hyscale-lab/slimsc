Okay, so I've got this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start at the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner, with a total length of 16. Each path is made up of moves either to the right or upwards, right? So, normally, without any restrictions, the number of such paths would be the combination of 16 moves taken 8 at a time for either right or up. But here, the twist is that the path changes direction exactly four times.

Hmm, direction changes. So, each time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. Wait, so if I'm moving right, and then I switch to up, that's one change, and then if I switch back to right, that's another change. So, each switch counts as one.

So, the problem is asking for the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times. That means the path alternates between right and up movements, and this alternation happens four times. So, how do I model this?

I remember that for grid paths with direction changes, we can model them using something called "runs." A run is a consecutive sequence of the same direction. For example, if I go right three times, that's a run of length three. Each time the direction changes, a new run starts. So, if a path has four direction changes, that means it has five runs in total. Because each change starts a new run, so starting from the first run, each change adds another run.

Wait, let me think. Suppose I have a path that starts with right. If it changes direction once, it would have two runs: right followed by up. If it changes direction twice, it would have three runs: right, up, right, for example. So, four direction changes would lead to five runs. So, each path with four direction changes has five runs, alternating between right and up.

But wait, the starting direction could be either right or up. So, there are two cases: paths that start with right and paths that start with up. Each case would have their own counts, so maybe I need to consider both.

So, let me structure this. First, determine whether the path starts with right or up. Then, for each case, calculate the number of paths with four direction changes.

Wait, but in an 8x8 grid, the number of right moves and up moves are both 8. So, regardless of the starting direction, the total number of right and up moves must each be 8.

So, if the path starts with right, then the runs of right and up would alternate, starting and ending with right. Because if you have five runs, and it starts with right, the runs would be right, up, right, up, right. So, three runs of right and two runs of up. Alternatively, if the path starts with up, then the runs would be up, right, up, right, up. So, three runs of up and two runs of right.

Wait, but in both cases, the number of right and up moves must add up to 8 each. So, let's take the first
