Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to wrap my head around it. Hmm, a torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis in its plane. The problem says the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. So, I think that forms a torus with major radius 6 and minor radius 3. 

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus is placed inside and outside the sphere, and in each case, they're tangent along a circle. When the torus is inside, the circle of tangency has radius r_i, and when it's outside, it's r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, maybe I should first recall what it means for two surfaces to be tangent along a circle. When two surfaces are tangent, they touch at a single point or along a curve, in this case, a circle. So, for the torus inside the sphere, they touch along a circle on the sphere's surface, and same when it's outside.

I think I need to find the radii of these circles where the torus is tangent to the sphere in both internal and external cases. Let me visualize this. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, and the torus just touches it from the inside somewhere. When it's outside, the torus must be bigger relative to the sphere, but wait, no, the sphere's radius is fixed at 11, and the torus is the same in both cases.

Wait, no. The torus is fixed; the sphere is fixed. The torus is placed inside the sphere, touching it internally, and then placed outside, touching externally. So, for internal tangency, the torus is entirely inside the sphere, except for the tangent circle. For external tangency, the torus is outside the sphere, touching along a circle.

I think I need to find the points where the distance from the center of the sphere to the torus is equal to the sphere's radius, either from the inside or the outside. 

Let me think about the geometry. A torus can be described in 3D coordinates. The standard equation for a torus is (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2, where R is the major radius and r is the minor radius. In this case, R is 6 and r is 3.

So, the equation would be (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.

Now, the sphere is centered at the origin, I assume, because the torus is symmetric around the axis which is a distance 6 from the center. Wait, no, the torus is formed by rotating a circle with radius 3, centered at (6,0,0), around the z-axis, I think. So, the center of the generating circle is at (6,0,0), and it's rotated around the z-axis.

Wait, no, actually, the axis is in the plane of the circle. So, maybe the circle is in the x-y plane, and the axis is the z-axis. Hmm, no, the axis is in the plane, so perhaps it's the x-axis. Let me try to clarify.

Wait, the torus is formed by revolving a circle around an axis in its plane, which is 6 units away from the center. So, the circle is in, say, the x-y plane, and the axis is the z-axis, but wait, no, the axis is in the plane of the circle, so maybe it's the x-axis? So, the circle is in the x-y plane, centered at (6,0,0), and the axis is the x-axis. So, when you revolve it around the x-axis, you get a torus. Hmm, that might make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the circle is in the x-y plane, centered at (0,0,0), and the axis is along the z-axis. Wait, no, the axis is a distance of 6 from the center of the circle. So, if the circle is at (0,0,0), the axis is 6 units away. So, maybe the axis is along the z-axis, but shifted so that it's 6 units away from the circle's center. So, the generating circle is at (6,0,0
