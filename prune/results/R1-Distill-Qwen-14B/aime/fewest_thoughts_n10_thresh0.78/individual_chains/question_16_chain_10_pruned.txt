Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the least prime number p where there's a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I have to find the smallest m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, alright, let's break this down.

First, I think I need to understand what it means for p² to divide n⁴ + 1. That means when we divide n⁴ + 1 by p², there's no remainder. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². That's a crucial point. So, n⁴ is congruent to -1 modulo p squared.

I remember that for primes, certain conditions have to be met for such congruences to exist. Maybe I should start by considering small primes and see if they satisfy this condition. Let me list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.

Let's start with p=2. Then p² is 4. We need n⁴ +1 ≡ 0 mod 4. Let's see what n⁴ mod 4 is. Since any even number squared is 0 mod 4, and any odd number squared is 1 mod 4. So, n² mod 4 is either 0 or 1. Then n⁴ would be (n²)², so if n is even, n⁴ ≡ 0 mod 4, and n⁴ +1 ≡ 1 mod 4, which isn't 0. If n is odd, n² ≡ 1 mod 4, so n⁴ ≡ 1 mod 4, and n⁴ +1 ≡ 2 mod 4, which isn't 0 either. So p=2 doesn't work.

Next, p=3. Then p²=9. Let's check n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod 9. So n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9, which is the same as 8 mod 9. Let me compute n⁴ mod9 for n=1 to 8 because of mod9's periodicity.

n=1: 1⁴=1 → 1 mod9
n=2: 16 mod9 is 7
n=3: 81 mod9 is 0
n=4: 256 mod9: 256 ÷9=28*9=252, remainder 4 → 4
n=5: 625 mod9: 625-69*9=625-621=4 →4
Wait, maybe I should compute each step.

Wait, 2⁴=16 mod9 is 7. 3⁴=81 mod9=0. 4⁴=(4²)²=(16)² mod9. 16 mod9 is 7, so 7²=49 mod9=4. 5⁴: 5²=25 mod9=7, so 7²=49 mod9=4. 6⁴=(6²)²=36² mod9=0. 7⁴: 7²=49 mod9=4, so 4²=16 mod9=7. 8⁴: 8²=64 mod9=1, so 1²=1 mod9.

So, for n=1:1, n=2:7, n=3:0, n=4:4, n=5:4, n=6:0, n=7:7, n=8:1. So n⁴ mod9 for n=1 to 8 gives 1,7,0,4,4,0,7,1. None of these are 8 mod9. So p=3 doesn't work either.

Hmm, moving on to p=5, p²=25. Let's see if there exists n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod25, which is 24 mod25. I need to compute n⁴ mod25 for various n and see if 24 shows up.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. I remember that Fermat's little theorem says that if p is prime, then n^{p-1} ≡1 mod p if n not divisible by p. But here, we're dealing with p², so maybe Euler's theorem is more appropriate. Euler's theorem says that for n and m coprime, n^φ(m) ≡1 mod m, where φ is Euler's totient function.

φ(25)=20, so n^20≡1 mod25 if n and 25 are coprime. So the multiplicative order of n modulo 25 divides 20. Now, for n⁴≡-1 mod25, squaring both sides gives n^8≡1 mod25. So the order of n modulo25 must divide 8 and 20, right? The least common multiple of orders?

Wait, maybe if n⁴ ≡-1 mod25, then n^8≡1 mod25. So the order of n modulo25 is 8. But 8 must divide φ(25)=20, which it does because 20 is divisible by 8? Wait, 20 divided by 8 is 2.5, which isn't an integer. So 8 doesn't divide 20, which is φ(25). That would mean that n^8 mod25 can't be 1 unless the order is a divisor of both 8 and 20, which is gcd(8,20)=4. So the order must divide 4. But then if the order is 4, then n^4≡1 mod25, not -1. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, there's no solution for n⁴≡-1 mod25. Thus, p=5 can't work.

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me check. Maybe I made a mistake in reasoning. So let
