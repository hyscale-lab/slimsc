Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I need to figure out how many ways there are to place digits in a 2x3 grid. The conditions are that when you read the numbers left to right, their sum is 999, and when you read them top to bottom, their sum is 99. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, let's visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so there are two rows and three columns. Each cell will contain a digit from 0 to 9. Let me denote the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 
a & b & c \\ \hline 
d & e & f \\ \hline 
\end{array}
\]

So, the top row is a three-digit number, and the bottom row is another three-digit number. The sum of these two three-digit numbers should be 999. Additionally, each column forms a two-digit number when read top to bottom, and the sum of these three two-digit numbers should be 99.

Let me write down the equations based on this setup.

First, the sum of the two three-digit numbers:
Top number: 100a + 10b + c
Bottom number: 100d + 10e + f
Sum: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999

Second, the sum of the three two-digit numbers:
First column: 10a + d
Second column: 10b + e
Third column: 10c + f
Sum: (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

So now I have two equations:

1) 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
2) 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

I need to solve these equations to find the possible digits (0-9 for each cell, except maybe a and d which can't be zero if leading digits, but wait, actually, since they are part of three-digit numbers, a and d can't be zero because otherwise, the number would effectively be a two-digit or one-digit number. Wait no, the problem says "place a digit in each cell", so maybe leading zeros are allowed? Hmm, the example given has a 0 in the top-left cell, so a can be zero. Wait, the example has a 0 in the top row, but when you read the top row, it's 008, which is 8, and the bottom row is 991. So 8 + 991 = 999. So in that case, leading zeros are allowed because 008 is just 8. Similarly, when reading top to bottom, the columns are 09, 09, 81, which are 9, 9, 81. So their sum is 99. So, leading zeros are allowed in both the row and column numbers. So, that means a and d can be zero. So, all digits a, b, c, d, e, f can be from 0 to 9.

So, both a and d can be zero.

Back to the equations.

Equation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Hmm, maybe I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to find a relationship between the digits.

Equation 1 minus Equation 2:

(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99

Let me compute this step by step.

100a - 10a = 90a

10b -10b = 0

c -10c = -9c

100d - d = 99d

10e - e = 9e

f - f = 0

So, altogether: 90a -9c +99d +9e = 900

I can factor out a 9:

9(10a - c + 11d + e) = 900

Divide both sides by 9:

10a - c + 11d + e = 100

Hmm, that's an interesting equation. Let me write that as:

10a + 11d + e - c = 100. [Equation 3]

So Equation 3: 10a + 11d + e - c = 100

Now, let's think about the possible ranges for the variables.

Each variable a, b, c, d, e, f is a digit from 0
