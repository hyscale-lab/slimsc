Alright, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon named ABCDEF. It says all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Then, there's a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, and the lengths of those sides are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. A convex hexagon, so all interior angles are less than 180 degrees. It's equilateral, meaning all sides are equal in length. Also, opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC parallel to EF, and CD parallel to FA. That structure reminds me of a hexagon that's like a prism or something, but in 2D.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, 300. I think these are the lengths of the sides of the triangle, which are the extensions of these hexagon sides. So, if we extend AB, CD, and EF, they meet to form a triangle with those side lengths.

Wait, actually, in the problem statement, it says "the triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF." So, each side of the triangle is an extension of one of these hexagon sides. So, each side of the triangle is a continuation of AB, CD, or EF.

Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, and opposite sides are parallel, I think this hexagon is similar to a regular hexagon but stretched or scaled in some way.

Let me think about how the extensions of AB, CD, EF form a triangle. Maybe the triangle is the outer triangle that encloses the hexagon? Or perhaps the hexagon is inscribed within that triangle.

Wait, maybe I should draw a diagram. Since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it. Let me consider the triangle first. Let's say the triangle is ABC with sides 200, 240, 300. But wait, actually, the sides of the triangle are the extensions of AB, CD, EF, so each side of the triangle corresponds to one of these extensions.

Wait, AB is a side of the hexagon. Its extension would form part of the triangle's side. Similarly, CD and EF are sides of the hexagon, and their extensions form the other two sides of the triangle.

So, the triangle is formed by these three extended sides. So, each side of the triangle is essentially an extension of AB, CD, EF beyond the hexagon.

Since the hexagon is convex, these extensions would meet at some points outside the hexagon, forming a larger triangle.

Given that all sides of the hexagon are equal, let's denote the side length as 's'. So, AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA = s.

Since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as a centrally symmetric figure. Wait, but in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel and equal, but in this case, it's only equilateral and opposite sides are parallel. So, maybe it's a regular hexagon? No, because in a regular hexagon, all sides and angles are equal, but
