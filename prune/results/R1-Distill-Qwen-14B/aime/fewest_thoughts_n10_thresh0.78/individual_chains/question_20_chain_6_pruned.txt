Okay, so I've got this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand what's being asked. 

We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips. Each cell can hold at most one chip. The conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for each column. Also, once we place the chips, any additional chip would violate these conditions. So, we need to find the number of ways to place some chips under these rules.

Hmm, let me break it down. The grid is 5x5, so 25 cells. Each cell can have at most one chip. So, we're only placing some subset of these, but not necessarily all.

The key constraints are:

1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. The placement is maximal, meaning we can't add any more chips without violating the above two conditions.

Wait, so each row can have either all white, all black, or no chips. Similarly, each column can have all white, all black, or no chips. But wait, that might not be the case. Because if a row has some chips, they must all be the same color. So for each row, the chips are either all white, all black, or none. Same for each column.

But then, when considering the grid as a whole, the coloring of the rows and columns must be consistent. Because, for example, if a row is white, and a column is black, their intersection must be handled somehow. But wait, each cell can have at most one chip, so that intersection can't have both a white and black chip. So maybe the row and column colorings must be compatible.

Wait, maybe I should model this as each row being either white, black, or empty, and each column being either white, black, or empty, but the color assignments must agree where the row and column intersect. If a row is white, then all the cells in that row must be white (if they have chips). Similarly, a column that's black must have all its cells black. So, the color assignments for rows and columns can't conflict.

Alternatively, perhaps the color assignments for rows and columns must form a sort of partition. Let me think.

Suppose each row is assigned a color: white, black, or empty. Similarly for each column. But at
