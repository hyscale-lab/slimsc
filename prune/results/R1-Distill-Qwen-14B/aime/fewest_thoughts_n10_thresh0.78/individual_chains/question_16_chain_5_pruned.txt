Okay, so I came across this math problem, and it's a bit challenging, but I think I can work through it step by step. Let me try to unpack what it's asking.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, we need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². 

Alright, so first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Once we have that p, we then find the smallest m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Let me start by understanding what it means for p² to divide n⁴ + 1. That means that when you divide n⁴ +1 by p², there's no remainder. In other words, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

So, for a prime p, I need to find if there exists an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². And I need the smallest such prime p.

I remember that for primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p², this condition holds. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact conditions for that. Maybe I should first consider small primes and see if they satisfy this condition.

Let's list out small primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. I'll check each to see if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

Starting with p=2. Let's compute n⁴ +1 mod 4. n can be 1 or 3 mod 4, but wait, for modulus 4, n can be 0,1,2,3. Let me compute n⁴ mod 4.

n=1: 1⁴=1, 1 +1=2 mod 4. So 2 mod 4, which isn't 0. So 4 doesn't divide 2.

n=2: 16 +1=17, which mod 4 is 1, so 17 mod 4 is 1. Not 0.

n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2 mod 4. Not 0.

So, n⁴ +1 is never 0 mod 4. So p=2 is out.

Next, p=3. Let's check if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9.

Compute n⁴ mod 9 for n from 1 to 8.

n=1: 1 mod9. 1 +1=2, not 0.

n=2: 16 mod9=7. 7 +1=8 mod9, not 0.

n=3: 81 mod9=0. 0 +1=1 mod9, not 0.

n=4: 256 mod9. 256 /9 is 28*9=252, 256-252=4. So 4 mod9. 4 +1=5 mod9, not 0.

n=5: 625 mod9. Let's compute 625-9*69=625-621=4. So 4 mod9. 4+1=5, nope.

n=6: 1296 mod9=0. 0 +1=1 mod9.

n=7: 7⁴= (7²)²=49²=2401. 2401 mod9: Let's sum the digits: 2+4+0+1=7, 7 mod9 is 7. So 7 +1=8 mod9.

n=8: 8⁴=4096. Sum digits: 4+0+9+6=19→10→1 mod9. So 1 +1=2 mod9.

So none of the numbers from 1 to 8 have n⁴ ≡ -1 mod9. So p=3 is not suitable.

Next, p=5. Let's check if there's an n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25.

Compute n⁴ mod25 for n=1 to 24, but that's a bit tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way.

I know that for modulus p², if n ≡ a mod p, then n = a + kp for some k. Maybe I can use Hensel's lemma or some lifting the exponent lemma.

Alternatively, for primes where 8 divides (p-1), higher powers might have solutions.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to first check if -1 is a quartic residue mod p. If it is, then maybe it's also a quartic residue mod p².

But for p=5, let's compute n⁴ mod5 first. Because if n⁴ ≡-1 mod5, then it might lift to mod25.

Compute n=1: 1 mod5. 1≠-1.

n=2: 16 mod5=1. Not -1.

n=3: 81 mod5=1. Still 1.

n=4: 256 mod5=1. Hmm, all n⁴ mod5 are 0 or 1. So n⁴ ≡0 or 1 mod5. So n⁴ ≡-1 mod5 is impossible because -1 mod5 is 4, which is not 0 or1. So p=5 cannot be our prime.

Wait, but if n⁴ ≡-1 mod5 is impossible, then certainly n⁴ +1 isn't divisible by5². So p=5 is out.

Next, p=7. Let's check if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod49.

First, check mod7. Compute n⁴ mod7.

n=1:1, n=2:16 mod7=2, n=3:81 mod7=4, n=4:256 mod7=4, n=5:625 mod7=2, n=6:1296 mod7=1.

Wait, so n⁴ mod7 can be 1, 2, or 4. So -1 mod7 is 6. None of these are 6, so n⁴ ≡-1 mod7 is impossible. Therefore, n⁴ +1 can't be 0 mod7, so p=7 is out.

Next prime: p=11.

Check mod11. Let's compute n⁴ mod11.

Compute n from 1 to 10:

n=1:1, n=2:16 mod11=5, n=3:81 mod11=4, n=4:25
