Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each time, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, regardless of how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's break this down. Since Alice goes first, Bob is the second player. So, Bob can only win if the starting number of tokens is in a position where no matter what Alice does, Bob can force a win.

I think this is a combinatorial game theory problem, probably involving something like the concept of "winning positions" and "losing positions." A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does, and a losing position is the opposite.

So, to model this, I should probably figure out for each n whether it's a winning or losing position. But since the players can remove 1 or 4 tokens each turn, the possible moves from a position n are n-1 and n-4. 

Let me try writing out the positions for small n to see if I can find a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a losing position for Bob.

n=2: Alice can take 1, leaving n=1 for Bob, who then loses as we saw. Or Alice could try taking 4, but that's not possible since n=2. So Alice can only take 1, leaving n=1 for Bob. So n=2 is a winning position for Alice. So Bob can't guarantee a win here.

Wait, wait. Wait, n=2: If Alice takes 1, leaving 1 token. Then Bob's turn. Bob can take that 1 token and win. Oh! Wait, so in n=2, Alice can take 1, then Bob takes the last one and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob. Wait, no. Wait, wait, let me think again.

Wait, when n=2, it's Alice's turn. She can take either 1 or 4 tokens. But she can't take 4 because n=2 <4. So she must take 1, leaving n=1 for Bob. Now, Bob is faced with n=1. He can take 1 token and win. So in this case, Bob can win if n=2. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So for n=2, Bob can win.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me correct myself.

Wait, in n=2, Alice takes 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes the last token and wins. So in this case, if n=2, Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, which is a winning position for Bob. So Bob can win when n=2.

Wait, but then what about n=3?

n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving n=2 for Bob. From n=2, as we saw, Bob can win because he can take 1, leaving n=1 for Alice, and then she takes
