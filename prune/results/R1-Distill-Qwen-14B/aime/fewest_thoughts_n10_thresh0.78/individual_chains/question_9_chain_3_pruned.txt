Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the product of two numbers, x and y, both greater than 1. The problem says that log base x of y^x is equal to 10, and log base y of x^(4y) is also equal to 10. Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember some logarithm properties. One of the key properties is that log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. So maybe I can use that here. Let me write down the given equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^(4y)) = 10

Let me try to convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form to see if that helps.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the property, this should mean that x^10 = y^x. So, x raised to the 10th power equals y raised to the xth power. That's equation (1a): x^10 = y^x.

Now the second equation: log_y(x^(4y)) = 10. Converting that, we get y^10 = x^(4y). So, y to the 10th power equals x to the 4y power. That's equation (2a): y^10 = x^(4y).

Hmm, now I have two equations:

1a. x^10 = y^x
2a. y^10 = x^(4y)

I need to find x and y such that both are greater than 1 and satisfy these equations. Maybe I can take the logarithm of both sides of each equation to make it easier to handle. Let's try that.

Taking natural logarithms on both sides of equation 1a:

ln(x^10) = ln(y^x)

Using the power rule for logarithms, which is ln(a^b) = b*ln(a), so:

10*ln(x) = x*ln(y)

Similarly, do the same for equation 2a:

ln(y^10) = ln(x^(4y))

Again, applying the power rule:

10*ln(y) = 4y*ln(x)

So now I have two equations in terms of ln(x) and ln(y):

Equation (1b): 10*ln(x) = x*ln(y)
Equation (2b): 10*ln(y) = 4y*ln(x)

Hmm, so we have two equations with ln(x) and ln(y). Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute.

Let me denote A = ln(x) and B = ln(y). Then the equations become:

1b. 10A = x*B
2b. 10B = 4y*A

Now, I can express A and B in terms of x and y, but perhaps it's better to express one variable in terms of the other.

From equation (1b): A = (x*B)/10

From equation (2b): B = (4y*A)/10 = (2y*A)/5

Wait, so let's substitute A from equation (1b) into equation (2b).

Equation (2b): B = (2y/5) * A = (2y/5) * (x B /10) = (2y * x * B) / (5*10) = (2xy B)/50 = (xy B)/25

So B = (xy B)/25

Hmm, let me write that:

B = (xy / 25) * B

Hmm, if I subtract (xy / 25)*B from both sides, I get:

B - (xy/25) B = 0

Factor out B:

B [1 - (xy/25)] = 0

So either B = 0 or [1 - (xy/25)] = 0.

But B is ln(y). Since y > 1, ln(y) is positive, so B can't be zero. Therefore, the other factor must be zero:

1 - (xy/25) = 0 → xy = 25.

So that gives us the product xy = 25. Wait, that's the answer we're supposed to find! So maybe that's it? But let me confirm because I might have made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let me go through that substitution again step by step to make sure.

From equation (1b): A = (x B)/10

Substitute this into equation (2b):

B = (2y/5) * A = (2y/5) * (x B /10) = (2y x B) / 50 = (xy B)/25

So, B = (xy/25) * B.

Subtracting (xy/25) B from both sides:

B - (xy/25) B = 0 → B [1 - (xy/25)] = 0.

Since B ≠ 0, we have 1 - (xy/25) = 0 → xy =25.

So, that's neat. So xy is 25. So the answer is 25. But wait, let me check whether this satisfies the original equations.

Wait, is this the only solution? Because if I have xy=25, does that mean we can find specific x and y? Let me see.

From equation (1a): x^10 = y^x.

But since y = 25/x, substitute into equation (1a):

x^10 = (25/x)^x

Which is x^10 = 25^x / x^x.

Multiply both sides by x^x:

x^{10 + x} = 25^x.

Similarly, 25 is 5^2, so 25^x = (5^2)^x =5^{2x}= (5^x)^2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps directly. Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides.

ln(x^{10 + x}) = ln(25^x)

Which gives: (10 +x)*ln(x) = x*ln(25)

Hmm, maybe I can write this as:

(10 + x) ln x = x ln 25

Similarly, from equation (2a): y^10 = x^{4y}

But since y =25/x, substitute:

(25/x)^10 = x^{4*(25/x)}.

Which is 25^{10}/x^{10} = x^{100
