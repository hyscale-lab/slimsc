Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. A dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a 12-gon. The rectangles can have their sides either on the sides or the diagonals of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, you can form rectangles by connecting pairs of vertices in specific ways. 

First, I need to visualize the dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Since it's regular, the symmetry should help in counting the rectangles. I think the key here is to figure out how rectangles can be formed by choosing pairs of parallel sides. Because a rectangle has opposite sides equal and parallel, so I need to find sets of four vertices that make such a shape.

In a regular polygon, the sides can be of different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. For example, in a dodecagon, the sides are the edges (which connect adjacent vertices), but the diagonals can be of different lengths. The length depends on the number of vertices they skip. So, for a regular dodecagon, the possible diagonals can be categorized based on how many vertices they skip. For instance, a diagonal could connect a vertex to the one two steps away, three steps, etc., up to five steps because beyond that, it's the same as the shorter diagonals on the other side due to the polygon's symmetry.

Wait, actually, in a 12-gon, the maximum number of vertices a diagonal can skip is 5 because 12 is even. If you connect a vertex with one more than half the total, you get the same as connecting with one fewer. So, diagonals can skip 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 vertices.

Now, to form a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular polygon, two sides are parallel if the number of vertices they skip is the same. So, for example, if a side skips k vertices, any other side that skips k vertices will be parallel to it. Thus, to form a rectangle, I need two different sets of such parallel sides.

So, the problem reduces to choosing two different "steps" (skip counts) and then counting how many rectangles can be formed with those steps. Each rectangle is determined by two pairs of parallel sides with different step counts.

Let me think of this more concretely. Suppose I pick two step sizes, say m and n, where m and n are the number of vertices each side skips. Then, for each pair (m, n), the number of rectangles would be determined by how many positions they can occupy without overlapping.

Wait, but how exactly? Let's consider that for each step size m, the number of sides of that type is 12, because each vertex connects to another via a step of m. But since each side is shared by two vertices, the total number of such sides is 12. Similarly for step size n.

But to form a rectangle, we need two sides of step m and two sides of step n, arranged such that they form a closed figure. So, perhaps we need to choose two starting points for the sides of step m and two for step n, such that they intersect at right angles.

Wait, maybe another approach: in a regular polygon with an even number of sides, rectangles can be formed by choosing pairs of opposite sides. But given that a dodecagon is regular, it's symmetric, so the number of rectangles can be calculated based on the number of ways to choose diameters and then pairs of points on those diameters.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of selecting two perpendicular diameters. Because in a regular dodecagon, the diameters are lines connecting opposite vertices. So, each diameter can be thought of as a line of symmetry. If I can choose two perpendicular diameters, their intersection will be the center of the dodecagon, and each pair of points on these diameters will form a rectangle.

But wait, a regular dodecagon has multiple diameters. Let me figure out how many diameters there are. Since it's a 12-gon, each vertex has an opposite vertex, so the number of diameters is 12/2 = 6. So, 6 diameters in total.

Now, how many pairs of perpendicular diameters are there? Each diameter can be paired with another that is perpendicular to it. Since the dodecagon is regular, each diameter will have a certain angle. The angle between adjacent diameters is 30 degrees (since 360/12=30). So, two diameters are perpendicular if the angle between them is 90 degrees, which is 3 steps apart (since 3*30=90). So, each diameter can pair with three others: the ones 3, 6, and 9 steps apart? Wait, no, 6 steps would be the same as the original diameter because 6*30=180, which is the same as the opposite direction.

Wait, actually, perhaps only those 3 steps apart. Let me think. For a diameter at 0 degrees (connecting vertex 1 and 7, let's say), the perpendicular diameters would be at 90 degrees (vertex 2 and 8), 180 degrees (same as the original, which is not perpendicular), 270 degrees (vertex 12 and 6). Wait, no. Actually, the perpendicular diameters would be at 90 and 270 degrees relative to the original. So, for a diameter at 0 degrees, the perpendicular ones are at 90 and 270, which are 3 steps (90 degrees) and 9 steps (270 degrees) away in terms of the number of 30-degree increments.

Wait, maybe not. Let me calculate the number of diameters that are perpendicular. Since the angle between adjacent diameters is 30 degrees, two diameters are perpendicular if the angle between them is 90 degrees, which is 3 steps (3 * 30 = 90). So, for each diameter, there are two others that are perpendicular to it: one 3 steps clockwise, and one 3 steps counterclockwise.

Wait, not exactly. Let's take a specific example. Suppose we have a diameter connecting vertex 1 and vertex 7. The diameters that are perpendicular to this would be the ones that make 90 degrees with it. The vertices for these would be at 45 degrees from the original diameter's endpoints. Wait, but in a 12-gon, the vertices are at every 30 degrees. So, the point halfway between 1 and 2 is at 15 degrees, but the diameters are at 0, 30, 60, etc.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the number of pairs of perpendicular diameters. Each perpendicular pair consists of two diameters at 90 degrees to each other. Since the dodecagon has 6 diameters, each separated by 30 degrees, how many such perpendicular pairs are there?

The total number of ways to choose two diameters is C(6,2)=15. But how many of these are perpendicular? Each diameter can form a perpendicular pair with two others: the one 3 steps ahead and the one 3 steps behind. Since 3 steps correspond to 90 degrees. So, for each diameter, there are two others that are perpendicular to it. So, total number of perpendicular pairs is 6 (diameters) * 2 / 2 = 6. Because each perpendicular pair is counted twice this way.

Let me verify. If diameters are labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, each 30 degrees apart, then the perpendicular pairs are (0,3), (1,4), (2,5), (3,0), (4,1), (5,2). Wait, but that counts each pair twice. So, unique perpendicular pairs are 3: (0,3), (1,4), (2,5). Hmm, so perhaps I was wrong before. So, each diameter is part of exactly one unique perpendicular pair. So, there are 3 unique pairs of perpendicular diameters.

Wait, no, wait. Because for each diameter, there are two others that are perpendicular to it, but each pair is shared between the two diameters. So, for 6 diameters, each diameter has 2 perpendicular partners, so the total number is (6*2)/2=6. But when I labeled them 0-3, 1-4, 2-5, each of these is a unique pair, and in that case, each pair is counted once. So, 3 unique pairs. Hmm, this discrepancy
