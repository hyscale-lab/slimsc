Okay, so I've got this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with equal probability. The question is asking for the probability that after coloring, there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, the octagon is regular, so it has rotational symmetry. That means if I rotate it by 45 degrees (which is 360/8), the shape looks the same. The problem is about coloring each vertex red or blue independently with a 50-50 chance. So each vertex has two possible colors, and there are 8 vertices, making the total number of colorings 2^8 = 256. That will be the denominator of our probability.

Now, the tricky part is figuring out the numerator, which is the number of colorings where we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. So, in other words, after some rotation, every blue vertex is now on top of a red vertex from the original configuration.

Wait, maybe another way to think about it: for such a rotation to exist, the set of blue vertices must be a rotated version of the set of red vertices. That is, the blue vertices must form a rotation of the red vertices. Since the octagon is regular, the rotations correspond to cyclic shifts of the vertices.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote the vertices as V0, V1, V2, ..., V7 in order around the octagon. Each vertex is colored red (R) or blue (B). We want to find colorings where there exists some rotation (i.e., some shift by k positions, where k is from 0 to 7) such that when we apply this rotation, every blue vertex moves to a red vertex's original position.

Wait, more precisely, if we have a rotation by k positions, then each vertex Vi moves to Vi+k mod 8. So, for the coloring to satisfy the condition, whenever Vi is blue, Vi+k must be red in the original coloring. So, the set of blue vertices is a subset of the red vertices shifted by -k. Alternatively, the set of blue vertices is the image of the red vertices under rotation by k.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of group theory here. The rotations form a cyclic group of order 8. The problem is about the colorings where the blue set is a translate of the red set under some group element.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue set is a rotation of the red set. Since the octagon is regular, any rotation of the red set is another set of the same size, but shifted around.

But wait, the red and blue sets don't necessarily have the same size, right? Because each vertex is colored independently, the number of red and blue vertices can vary. So, for the blue set to be a rotation of the red set, the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices, because rotation preserves the size. So, that's an important point. So, if the number of blue vertices isn't equal to the number of red vertices, then such a rotation can't exist. Therefore, we must only consider colorings where the number of blue vertices equals the number of red vertices, i.e., exactly 4 blue and 4 red.

Wait, that's a key insight. So, any valid coloring must have exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices. Because if you have, say, 3 blue and 5 red, then the blue set can't be a rotation of the red set because they have different sizes. So,
