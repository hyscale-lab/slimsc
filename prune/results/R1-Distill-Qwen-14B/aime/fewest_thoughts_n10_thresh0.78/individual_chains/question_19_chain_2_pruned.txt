Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find AB multiplied by AC in triangle ABC. The problem says that triangle ABC has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. Hmm, okay.

First, let me recall some properties of triangle centers. The circumcenter O is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors, and it's the center of the circumscribed circle around the triangle. The incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors and is the center of the inscribed circle. 

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, that seems like a key piece of information. Maybe I can use some coordinate geometry here, placing the triangle in a coordinate system to make things easier.

Wait, but before jumping into coordinates, maybe I should think about some known formulas or relations involving the inradius, circumradius, and other elements. I remember that the area of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter: Area = r * s, where r is the inradius and s is the semiperimeter. Also, the area can be expressed using the circumradius R and the sides: Area = (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides.

But the problem is asking for AB * AC, which are two sides of the triangle. Let's denote AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a, following the standard notation where a is opposite angle A, etc. So we're looking for b * c.

I also remember that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be found using the formula b * c = 2 * R * (a + b + c) / (1 + cos A), but I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Maybe there's a better approach.

Hmm, considering the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems geometric, so perhaps using vectors or coordinate geometry could be beneficial. Let me think about how to place the triangle in a coordinate system.

Let me try placing point I at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity. Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), IA is a vector from I to A, which is (x, y), and OI is the vector from I to O, which is (h, k). The condition is that these two vectors are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero: x * h + y * k = 0.

But I don't know the coordinates of O yet. Wait, O is the circumcenter. If I place I at (0,0), then O is at (h,k), and A is at (x,y). Maybe I can express other points in terms of these variables.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use vector approaches or coordinate-free methods. Let me think about the properties of O and I.

I also remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula: OI^2 = R(R - 2r), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me compute that: OI^2 = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 -12) = 13*1=13. So OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, that's useful. So the distance between O and I is sqrt(13). And since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle with right angle at I. So in triangle OIA, IA is perpendicular to OI, so by Pythagoras: OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2.

But OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So 13^2 = (sqrt(13))^2 + IA^2 => 169 = 13 + IA^2 => IA^2 = 156 => IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).

Now, IA is the
