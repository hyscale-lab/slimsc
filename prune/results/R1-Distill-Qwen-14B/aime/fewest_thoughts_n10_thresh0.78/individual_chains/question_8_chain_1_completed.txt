Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, I'll write down what I know:

1. The sum a + b + c = 300. That's straightforward. So all three variables add up to 300.

2. The second equation is a bit more complex: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Let me see if I can factor this expression or find a way to relate it to the first equation.

Looking at the second equation, I notice that each term is a product of two variables, one squared and the other to the first power. For example, a²b and a²c both have a² multiplied by another variable. Similarly, b²a and b²c have b² multiplied by another variable, and the same for c²a and c²b.

So, maybe I can factor this expression. Let me try grouping terms:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the entire second equation can be written as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c), (a + c), and (a + b) in terms of 300 - a, 300 - b, and 300 - c respectively. Let me substitute that:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

So that's:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Wait, that's a bit messy. Maybe I can factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I can divide both sides by 100 to simplify:

3(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)/100 = 60,000.

Wait, that might not be helpful. Let me think differently.

Since a + b + c = 300, maybe I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of that. I know that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). So,

a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + ac + bc) = 300² - 2(ab + ac + bc) = 90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc).

So, substituting that into the equation I had earlier:

3*(90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc)) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let's compute 3*90,000:

3*90,000 = 270,000.

So, 270,000 - 6(ab + ac + bc) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Wait, let me re-arrange that:

- (a³ + b³ + c³) -6(ab + ac + bc) + 270,000 = 6,000,000.

Hmm, moving things around:

- (a³ + b³ + c³) -6(ab + ac + bc) = 6,000,000 - 270,000.

6,000,000 - 270,000 is 5,730,000.

So,

- (a³ + b³ + c³ + 6(ab + ac + bc)) = 5,730,000.

Multiply both sides by -1:

a³ + b³ + c³ + 6(ab + ac + bc) = -5,730,000.

Wait, that can't be right. Because a, b, c are nonnegative integers, so their cubes and products are nonnegative. So the left side is nonnegative, but the right side is negative. That doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake in the algebra?

Let me go back.

Starting from the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Expressed as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Since a + b + c = 300,

b + c = 300 - a,

a + c = 300 - b,

a + b = 300 - c.

So substitute:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Which expands to:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Factor out 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So,

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Then, earlier I expressed a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c)^2 and ab + ac + bc.

So, (a + b + c)^2 = 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc).

Thus, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc).

Substituting into the equation:

300*(90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc)) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Compute 300*90,000: 300*90,000 = 27,000,000.

So,

27,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Subtract 6,000,000 from both sides:

27,000,000 - 6,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 0.

Which is:

21,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 0.

So,

(a³ + b³ + c³) + 600(ab + ac + bc) = 21,000,000.

Hmm, that's better because both sides are positive now.

Wait, but the left side is (a³ + b³ + c³) + 600(ab + ac + bc). Hmm, is there any identity that relates this expression?

I recall that a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - ac - bc). But in our case, the sign is positive, and the coefficient is 600 for the ab terms, not 3.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to factor this or relate it to something else.

Wait, let me think about the expression (a + b + c)^3. Let me compute that.

(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a). Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, (a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b) + 6abc.

Wait, that's interesting. Let me write that down:

(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b) + 6abc.

But from our problem, we have that a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

So, substituting this into the expansion:

300^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3*(6,000,000) + 6abc.

Compute 300^3: 300*300=90,000; 90,000*300=27,000,000.

So,

27,000,000 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 18,000,000 + 6abc.

Subtract 18,000,000:

9,000,000 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 6abc.

So,

a³ + b³ + c³ + 6abc = 9,000,000.

Wait, but earlier we had an equation:

(a³ + b³ + c³) + 600(ab + ac + bc) = 21,000,000.

So, now I have two equations:

1. a³ + b³ + c³ + 6abc = 9,000,000.

2. a³ + b³ + c³ + 600(ab + ac + bc) = 21,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate a³ + b³ + c³.

So,

[ (a³ + b³ + c³ + 600(ab + ac + bc) ) ] - [ (a³ + b³ + c³ + 6abc) ] = 21,000,000 - 9,000,000.

Simplify:

600(ab + ac + bc) - 6abc = 12,000,000.

Divide both sides by 6:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, so now I have:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me write this as:

abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, maybe factor this, but I'm not sure how. Alternatively, perhaps set variables like x = ab + ac + bc and y = abc, then the equation becomes:

100x - y = 2,000,000.

So, y = 100x - 2,000,000.

But I also know that for three variables a, b, c, the following holds:

(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) + 6abc.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps using symmetric sums.

We have:

s1 = a + b + c = 300.

s2 = ab + ac + bc.

s3 = abc.

We know from equation 1 that:

a³ + b³ + c³ + 6abc = 9,000,000.

But we also have from the identity:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

So substituting,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300^3 - 3*300*s2 + 3*s3.

So,

300^3 - 3*300*s2 + 3*s3 + 6*s3 = 9,000,000.

Simplify:

27,000,000 - 900*s2 + 9*s3 = 9,000,000.

Subtract 9,000,000:

18,000,000 - 900 s2 + 9 s3 = 0.

Divide both sides by 9:

2,000,000 - 100 s2 + s3 = 0.

So,

s3 = 100 s2 - 2,000,000.

Which matches the earlier result where y = 100x - 2,000,000, where x is s2 and y is s3.

So, s3 = 100 s2 - 2,000,000.

So now, we have s1=300, s2=ab+ac+bc, s3=abc=100 s2 - 2,000,000.

So, now the problem reduces to finding the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers such that:

a + b + c = 300,

ab + ac + bc = s2,

abc = s3 = 100 s2 - 2,000,000.

So, we can think of a, b, c as roots of a cubic equation. Let me consider the polynomial whose roots are a, b, c:

x^3 - s1 x^2 + s2 x - s3 = 0.

Substituting s1=300, s3=100 s2 - 2,000,000, the polynomial becomes:

x^3 - 300 x^2 + s2 x - (100 s2 - 2,000,000) = 0.

Simplify:

x^3 - 300 x^2 + s2 x - 100 s2 + 2,000,000 = 0.

Factor terms with s2:

x^3 - 300 x^2 + s2 (x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can find s2.

Wait, from s3 = 100 s2 - 2,000,000, and since s3 = abc, which is nonnegative because a, b, c are nonnegative integers. So,

100 s2 - 2,000,000 ≥ 0 ⇒ s2 ≥ 20,000.

Similarly, s2 can't be too large because a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding to 300. The maximum possible value of ab + ac + bc occurs when two variables are as large as possible, but in our case, let me think about the possible range for s2.

Wait, when a, b, c are nonnegative integers with a + b + c = 300, the maximum of ab + ac + bc occurs when two variables are 150 and the third is 0, giving s2 = 150*150 + 150*0 + 150*0 = 22,500. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. Wait, if a = b = 150, c = 0, then ab = 150*150 = 22,500. ac = 150*0 = 0, bc = 150*0=0. So s2 = 22,500. But wait, I thought maybe higher, but actually, that's the maximum because if you spread the numbers more, the products decrease. For example, a=100, b=100, c=100: ab + ac + bc = 100*100 + 100*100 + 100*100 = 30,000. Wait, that's higher than 22,500. Hmm, so maybe the maximum is 30,000 when all are equal?

Wait, no, if a = b = c = 100, then ab + ac + bc = 100*100 + 100*100 + 100*100 = 30,000. But if a = 200, b = 100, c=0, then ab + ac + bc = 200*100 + 200*0 + 100*0 = 20,000. So, 30,000 is higher. So the maximum is 30,000. So s2 can range from 0 (if two variables are 0 and the third is 300) up to 30,000.

Wait, but in our case, s2 must be at least 20,000 because s3 is nonnegative. So s2 is between 20,000 and 30,000.

So, s2 ∈ [20,000, 30,000].

So, for each possible s2 in this range, we can compute s3 = 100 s2 - 2,000,000.

So, s3 = 100 s2 - 2,000,000.

So, for each s2 starting from 20,000 up to 30,000, s3 increases from 100*20,000 - 2,000,000 = 2,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 0 up to 100*30,000 - 2,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 1,000,000.

So, s3 ranges from 0 to 1,000,000.

But since s3 is abc, which is a product of nonnegative integers, s3 can be 0 to 1,000,000.

But how do we find the number of triples (a, b, c) for each s2 and s3?

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the equation s3 = 100 s2 - 2,000,000 and express it as:

abc = 100(ab + ac + bc) - 2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps rearrange:

abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) = -2,000,000.

Add 100^3 to both sides:

abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) + 100^3 = 100^3 - 2,000,000.

Compute 100^3 = 1,000,000.

So,

abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) + 1,000,000 = 1,000,000 - 2,000,000 = -1,000,000.

Wait, but I don't see an obvious factoring here.

Wait, perhaps factor the left side:

abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) + 100^3.

Hmm, maybe it factors as (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100). Let me check that.

Compute (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100):

= abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) + 100^2(a + b + c) - 100^3.

But in our case, a + b + c = 300, so:

= abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) + 100^2*300 - 100^3.

Compute 100^2*300 = 10,000 * 300 = 3,000,000.

100^3 = 1,000,000.

So,

= abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000.

= abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) + 2,000,000.

But in our equation, the left side is abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) + 1,000,000 = -1,000,000.

Wait, so:

(a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) + 100^2(a + b + c) - 100^3.

Which is:

= abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000.

= abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) + 2,000,000.

But our equation is:

abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) + 1,000,000 = -1,000,000.

So, substituting (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = (abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) + 2,000,000).

But our left side is abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) + 1,000,000. Hmm, which is 1,000,000 less than (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100). So,

abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) + 1,000,000 = (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) - 1,000,000.

So,

(a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) - 1,000,000 = -1,000,000.

Thus,

(a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = 0.

So,

(a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = 0.

Therefore, at least one of (a - 100), (b - 100), (c - 100) must be zero.

Which implies that at least one of a, b, c is equal to 100.

So, the triples (a, b, c) must have at least one variable equal to 100.

Now, considering that, let's proceed.

So, we can partition the problem into three cases:

1. a = 100, and b + c = 200.

2. b = 100, and a + c = 200.

3. c = 100, and a + b = 200.

But we have to be careful not to double-count triples where two variables are 100, or all three are 100.

Wait, let's see. Let me compute each case and then use inclusion-exclusion.

Firstly, compute the number of triples where a = 100.

Case 1: a = 100.

Then, b + c = 200.

We need to compute the number of nonnegative integer solutions to b + c = 200. That's 201 solutions (since b can be 0 to 200, and c = 200 - b).

But we also have the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Since a = 100,

Compute each term:

a²b = 100² b = 10,000 b,

a²c = 10,000 c,

b²a = b² * 100,

b²c = b² c,

c²a = c² * 100,

c²b = c² b.

So, sum all terms:

10,000(b + c) + 100(b² + c²) + b²c + c²b.

But since b + c = 200,

10,000 * 200 = 2,000,000.

So, 2,000,000 + 100(b² + c²) + b² c + c² b = 6,000,000.

So,

100(b² + c²) + b² c + c² b = 4,000,000.

We can write this as:

100(b² + c²) + bc(b + c) = 4,000,000.

But since b + c = 200,

100(b² + c²) + 200 bc = 4,000,000.

Divide both sides by 100:

b² + c² + 2 bc = 40,000.

But note that b² + c² + 2 bc = (b + c)^2 = 200² = 40,000.

So, 40,000 = 40,000. That's always true.

Therefore, for any b + c = 200, the equation holds.

So, in Case 1, all triples where a = 100 and b + c = 200 satisfy both given equations.

So, the number of solutions in this case is 201.

Similarly, for Case 2: b = 100, a + c = 200.

Same reasoning applies. We substitute b = 100 and find that the equation reduces to an identity, so all such triples satisfy the equation.

Number of solutions: 201.

Case 3: c = 100, a + b = 200.

Same as above. Number of solutions: 201.

Now, but wait, we need to check if there are overlaps where two variables are 100, as those would have been counted twice.

So, let's compute the number of triples where two variables are 100.

Subcase 1: a = 100, b = 100. Then, c = 300 - 100 - 100 = 100. So, (100, 100, 100).

Subcase 2: a = 100, c = 100. Then, b = 300 - 100 - 100 = 100. So, same as above.

Subcase 3: b = 100, c = 100. Similarly, a = 100. So, same triple.

So, there's only one triple where all three variables are 100. So, in each of the three cases, this triple is counted once.

But when we added the three cases, each with 201 solutions, the triple (100,100,100) was counted three times, once in each case. But in reality, there's only one such triple.

So, applying inclusion-exclusion:

Total = (201 + 201 + 201) - (number of overlaps).

But how many overlaps do we have?

We have overlaps when two variables are 100. For each pair, the number of overlapping triples is 1.

There are three such pairs: (a, b), (a, c), (b, c). Each contributes one triple, which is (100,100,100).

Thus, using inclusion-exclusion:

Total triples = 3*201 - 3*1 + 0 (since the triple (100,100,100) was subtracted three times and needs to be added back once if we're using inclusion-exclusion correctly).

Wait, no. Wait, inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|.

But in our case, each "set" is the set of triples where a=100, b=100, or c=100.

So, |A| is the number of triples where a=100: 201.

Similarly, |B| = 201, |C| = 201.

Now, |A ∩ B| is the number of triples where a=100 and b=100: which is c = 300 - 100 -100 = 100. So, only one triple: (100,100,100).

Similarly, |A ∩ C| is also 1, and |B ∩ C| is 1.

And |A ∩ B ∩ C| is also 1.

Thus, applying inclusion-exclusion:

Total = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|.

Which is:

201 + 201 + 201 - 1 - 1 -1 + 1 = 603 - 3 + 1 = 601.

Wait, 201*3 = 603. Then subtract 3 (the three pairwise intersections), giving 600, then add back 1 for the triple intersection, giving 601.

So, the total number of triples where at least one variable is 100 is 601.

But wait, each of these triples satisfies both equations because, as we saw earlier, when one variable is 100, the second equation reduces to an identity.

Therefore, the number of solutions is 601.

Wait, but let me check for possible mistakes.

Wait, when a=100, we have 201 solutions (b from 0 to 200, c=200 - b). Similarly for b=100 and c=100.

But when a=100 and b=100, c=100, that's one solution counted in all three cases.

So, using inclusion-exclusion, the total number is 3*201 - 3*(1) + 1*(1) = 603 -3 +1=601.

Wait, that's correct.

Therefore, the number of triples is 601.

Wait, but let me make sure that when a=100, all those 201 triples satisfy the second equation.

Earlier, when a=100, substituting into the second equation, we found that it reduces to an identity, which is always true. So, all 201 triples satisfy the equation when a=100. Same for b=100 and c=100.

So, yes, the total is 601.

Hence, the answer is 601.

**Final Answer**
The number of triples is \boxed{601}.


Given the problem of finding the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a, b, c)\) such that \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by analyzing the given equations.

First, we rewrite the second equation as:
\[a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b) = 6,000,000.\]
Using the fact that \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute \(b + c = 300 - a\), \(a + c = 300 - b\), and \(a + b = 300 - c\) into the equation, leading to:
\[300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000.\]

Next, we use the identity \((a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + ac + bc)\) to express \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\) in terms of \(ab + ac + bc\):
\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc).\]

Substituting this into our equation, we simplify and find:
\[3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000.\]
This leads to the identity involving the roots of a polynomial, which we factor to find that at least one of \(a, b, c\) must be 100.

We then consider the cases where \(a = 100\), \(b = 100\), or \(c = 100\). Each case involves solving for the remaining variables under the constraints \(a + b + c = 300\) and checking the second equation, which reduces to an identity, confirming all such triples satisfy the equation.

Using inclusion-exclusion principle, we count the number of solutions for each case and adjust for overlaps where two or all three variables are 100. The total number of valid triples is calculated as:
\[3 \times 201 - 3 \times 1 + 1 = 601.\]

Thus, the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) is \(\boxed{601}\).
