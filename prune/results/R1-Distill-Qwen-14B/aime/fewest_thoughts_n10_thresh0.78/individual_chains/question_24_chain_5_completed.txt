Okay, so I’ve got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in a list that meets certain conditions. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me list out the given properties:

1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9. So, 9 appears more frequently than any other number in the list.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. That's interesting because usually, the median is one of the numbers in the list, but here it's not.

Alright, let's start by recalling what mode means. The mode is the number that appears most often. Since it's the unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number. So, if there are other numbers, they can't appear as many times as 9.

Next, the median. The median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. If the list has an odd number of elements, it's the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle ones. But in this case, the median is a positive integer not in the list. Hmm, so that can't happen if the list has an odd number of elements because the median would be one of them. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements because then the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which might not be an integer present in the list.

Wait, actually, the median is a positive integer, so if it's the average of two numbers, those two numbers must add up to an even number so their average is an integer. But since the median isn't in the list, those two middle numbers must not include it.

Let me think about the structure of the list. Let's denote the list as a sorted list in ascending order: a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ.

Since the mode is 9, it must appear at least twice, but more than any other number. Let's consider how many times 9 appears.

Suppose 9 appears k times. Then, all other numbers must appear less than k times. So, to minimize the number of elements, maybe 9 appears twice, but then other numbers can appear once or twice, which might not be possible. Wait, actually, since it's the unique mode, it must appear more often than any other number. So, if another number appears twice, 9 must appear at least three times. Hmm, that might complicate things.

Wait, no, let me correct that. If another number appears two times, then 9 must appear at least three times to be the unique mode. Because if 9 appears two times and another number also appears two times, then there are two modes, which contradicts the unique mode. So, to be the unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number.

So, if 9 appears three times, others can appear a maximum of two times. If 9 appears four times, others can appear up to three, etc. Let's see what makes sense.

Also, the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, the list has an even number of elements since, for the median to not be in the list, the two middle numbers must average to an integer not present. Let's think about that.

Let me try to figure out the possible number of elements in the list. Let's denote n as the number of elements.

Case 1: n is even.

So, n is even, say n=2m. Then the median is (a_m + a_{m+1}) / 2. Since this median is an integer not in the list, a_m and a_{m+1} must be two numbers whose average is an integer, but that integer isn't in the list. So, a_m and a_{m+1} must be such that (a_m + a_{m+1}) is even, and the average is not in the list.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the list as having an even number of elements.

Let me start by trying to construct such a list.

Since 9 is the mode, it occurs the most. Let's suppose the list has n elements with 9 appearing three times. Then, other numbers can appear at most two times.

But let's also consider that the median is an integer not in the list. Let me try to find n such that when we arrange the numbers in order, the median is an integer not present.

Suppose n is 6. Then the median would be the average of the 3rd and 4th numbers. For that to be an integer, their sum must be even, and the average must be an integer not in the list.

Wait, n=6 might be manageable. Let's try that.

So, let's try n=6. Then the sum is 30, so the average is 5. So, the numbers should sum to 30, with 6 elements.

Since 9 is the mode, let's have three 9s. So, the list would have 9, 9, 9, and three other numbers. Let me denote them as a, b, c, with a <= b <= c.

Wait, but the list is sorted, so the entire list would be [a, b, c, 9, 9, 9]. Wait, no, because when sorted, the three 9s would be at the end if a, b, c are less than 9. But wait, they could be in the middle. Wait, no, because if a, b, c are all less than 9, then the list would be [a, b, c, 9, 9, 9]. Then the median would be the average of the 3rd and 4th elements, which are c and 9. So, (c + 9)/2 must be an integer not present in the list.

Wait, and that integer is the median, which is not in the list.

So, let me denote m = (c + 9)/2, which is an integer. So, c + 9 must be even, so c must be odd if 9 is odd. Wait, 9 is odd, so c must be odd for c + 9 to be even.

So, c is odd, and m = (c + 9)/2.

Also, m must not be present in the list. So, m isn't equal to any of a, b, c, or 9.

Additionally, the list has three 9s, so the sum is a + b + c + 9 + 9 + 9 = a + b + c + 27 = 30. So, a + b + c = 3.

Wait, a + b + c = 3. Since a, b, c are positive integers, and the list is sorted in non-decreasing order, a <= b <= c.

Possible combinations where a + b + c = 3.

The possible triplets (a,b,c) are:

(1,1,1): sum is 3.

Or, (1,1,1). Because 1+1+1=3. Alternatively, is there another way? 1+1+1 is the only way since 1 is the smallest positive integer, and any other combination would require numbers larger than 1, but their sum would exceed 3.

Wait, no. For example, 1+1+1 is 3. 1+1+1=3. The only triplet is (1,1,1).

So, the list would be [1,1,1,9,9,9].

Wait, but then the median is (1 + 9)/2 = 5, which is an integer not in the list.

Wait, but wait: the list is [1,1,1,9,9,9], so the 3rd and 4th elements are both 1 and 9. So, the median is (1 + 9)/2 = 5, which is not in the list. So that satisfies the median condition.

Now, let's check the mode. The number 9 appears three times, and 1 appears three times as well. Oh, wait! So in this case, both 1 and 9 appear three times. That would make them both modes, which contradicts the unique mode being 9. So, this list doesn't work.

So, this approach doesn't satisfy the unique mode condition. Hmm, that's a problem.

So, perhaps n=6 is not possible because having three 1s and three 9s would create two modes. So, we need a different approach.

So, perhaps n=6 isn't the right number of elements. Let's try n=7, but wait, n has to be even because the median is not in the list. Wait, no. Let me think again. For n odd, the median is the middle number, which is part of the list. So, to have the median not in the list, n has to be even.

So, let's try n=8. So, the median is the average of the 4th and 5th elements. So, (a₄ + a₅)/2 must be an integer not in the list.

Let me try to construct a list of 8 elements, with sum 30, unique mode 9, and median not in the list.

Let's have four 9s. So, 4 times 9 is 36, which is more than 30. That's a problem because the sum is 30. So, we can't have four 9s because 4*9=36>30.

So, 9 must appear at least three times. Let's try 3 times 9, sum contributed by 9s is 27, so the remaining 3 elements sum to 3. Let’s see.

So, the list would have three 9s, and five other numbers. Let me denote them as a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, with a1 <= a2 <= a3 <= a4 <= a5 <=9.

Wait, but if there are three 9s, then the list can be arranged as [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, 9,9,9]. Wait, no, because n=8, so the list would be [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, 9,9,9]. Wait, but that's 8 elements: a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, 9,9,9.

Wait, no, that's 8 elements, right? a1 to a5, then three 9s? No, that would be six elements. Hmm, wait n=8, so the list would be eight elements, including three 9s. So, the other five elements sum to 3. But that's impossible because five positive integers summing to 3. The minimum sum for five positive integers is 5 (all ones). But 5 is more than 3, so that can't happen. So, that approach won't work.

Hmm, so perhaps 3 nines is too many for n=8. Let's try n=8, with two 9s.

So, two 9s contribute 18 to the sum. Remaining sum is 12, spread over 6 elements. Let me arrange the list as [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, 9,9]. Wait, n=8, so the list is eight elements. So, the two 9s are at the end.

So, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, 9, 9.

Wait, no, they could be placed elsewhere, but for the median, which is the average of the 4th and 5th elements, to be an integer not in the list, a4 and a5 must sum to an even number, say 2m, so the median is m.

Now, since the list is sorted, a4 must be <= a5.

Let me try to make a list where a4 and a5 are such that (a4 + a5)/2 is an integer not in the list.

Let me attempt to construct such a list.

We have two 9s, so the remaining six numbers sum to 30 - 18 = 12. Let's denote the other six numbers as a, b, c, d, e, f, with a <= b <= c <= d <= e <= f <=9.

Wait, but if I have two 9s, and the other six numbers, which can be up to 8 or 9. But to have the mode as 9, it must appear more than any other number. So, if I have two 9s, then no other number can appear more than once. Because if a number appears twice, then 9 appears two times as well, which would make it a mode, but not unique. So, to have 9 as unique mode, the other numbers can appear at most once. So, in the six other numbers, each can appear once. So, the list would be [a, b, c, d, e, f, 9,9], with a, b, c, d, e, f all distinct, and each appearing once.

So, the sum of a + b + c + d + e + f = 12, with six distinct positive integers, each at least 1, and all <=8 (since 9 is already in the list twice). Wait, but 12 over six distinct positive integers. Let's see, the minimal sum for six distinct positive integers is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21, which is way more than 12. So, that's not possible. So, this approach doesn't work. Therefore, n=8 with two 9s is impossible.

So, perhaps we need a higher number of 9s. Let me try n=5. Wait, n=5 is odd, so the median is the 3rd element, which would be in the list. But the problem states that the median is not in the list, so n must be even. So, n=6,8,10,...

Wait, n=6 didn't work because we ended up with two modes. Let me try n=10.

Wait, n=10 would have a median of (5th +6th)/2. So, let's try that.

Wait, but n=10 might complicate things. Let me try n=4. Wait, n=4, the median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd elements. Let me see.

If n=4, the sum is 30, so average is 7.5. Let's see if that works.

Wait, but 30 divided by 4 is 7.5, but that's not an integer, but the median is an integer. Hmm.

Wait, but let me think. Let's try n=4, with 9 appearing more than any other number.

So, 9 must appear at least twice. Let's say 9 appears twice. Then, the other two numbers must sum to 30 - 18 = 12. Let's say the other two numbers are 6 and 6. Then the list would be [6,6,9,9]. Sum is 30, mode is 9 (appears twice, others appear twice as well). So, that's bimodal, which is not allowed. So, 9 must appear more than twice in n=4? Wait, but n=4, and 9 appears three times would require the sum of 9*3=27, plus the fourth number being 3, so list is [3,9,9,9]. Then the median is (9 +9)/2=9, which is in the list, which is not allowed. So, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, 9 appears three times, sum is 27, and the fourth number is 3. So, list is [3,9,9,9]. But then the median is (9 +9)/2=9, which is in the list, which violates the condition. So, n=4 doesn't seem to work.

Hmm, perhaps n=6 is the way to go, but we have to find a way where the other numbers don't have the same frequency as 9.

Wait, earlier, when I tried n=6 with three 9s, the other three numbers summed to 3, which can only be three 1s, making 1 also appear three times. That's a problem because 9 wouldn't be the unique mode.

So, maybe 9 appears four times? Let's try that. If 9 appears four times, that's 4*9=36, which is more than 30. So, that's impossible. So, n=6 can't have four 9s.

Wait, so maybe n=6 and 9 appears three times. Let me think again.

Wait, n=6, sum=30.

So, if 9 appears three times, that's 27. The remaining three numbers must sum to 3, but they can't have any number appearing three times. So, the other three numbers must each be 1, but that gives three 1s, which would make mode not unique. So, that's not possible.

So, perhaps 9 appears two times, and no other number appears more than once. So, sum is 18, so remaining four numbers sum to 12, each appearing once.

Wait, four numbers summing to 12, each at least 1, and all distinct. The minimal sum is 1+2+3+4=10, which is less than 12. So, possible.

So, let's say the four numbers are 1,2,3,6. Sum is 12. So, the list would be [1,2,3,6,9,9]. Wait, but that's six numbers. Let's arrange them in order: 1,2,3,6,9,9.

The median is (3 + 6)/2 = 4.5, which is not an integer. So, that's a problem because the median is supposed to be a positive integer. So, that doesn't work.

Hmm. Let me try another combination. Maybe 1,1,3,7. Sum is 12. Wait, but then 1 appears twice, which would mean 9 appears two times as well. So, the mode would be both 1 and 9, which is not allowed.

So, all other numbers must appear once. So, the four other numbers must be distinct and each appear once.

So, possible four numbers: 1,2,4,5. Sum is 12. So, the list is [1,2,4,5,9,9]. Wait, arranged in order: 1,2,4,5,9,9.

Median is (4 +5)/2=4.5, again not an integer. Hmm, not good.

Another try: 1,2,3,6. Sum is 12. Wait, same as before. Median is 4.5.

Alternatively, 1,3,4,4. But that's two 4s, which would make mode not unique.

Wait, maybe 2,2,3,5. But then 2 appears twice, same as 9. So, mode isn't unique.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck with n=6. Let me try a different approach.

Let me think about the median being an integer not present. So, the sum of the two middle numbers must be even, and their average is an integer, say m, which isn't in the list.

So, for n=6, the 3rd and 4th elements must sum to 2m, which is an even number, and m is not in the list.

So, let's say the 3rd element is a, and the 4th element is b, such that a + b = 2m, and m is not in the list.

So, a <= b, and both a and b are <=9.

Let me see possible pairs (a,b) such that a + b is even, and m = (a + b)/2 is not in the list.

Also, the list must have 9 as the unique mode, so 9 appears more times than any other number.

Let me try to have 9 appear three times. Then, the other three numbers sum to 3, but as before, that gives three 1s, which is a problem.

Alternatively, maybe 9 appears four times. Wait, 4*9=36>30, can't do that.

So, n=6 with three 9s and three other numbers. But the other three numbers must sum to 3, which only allows 1,1,1. So, that makes 1 appear three times, same as 9. So, unique mode fails.

Hmm, so maybe n=6 isn't the right number of elements.

Let me try n=8. So, the sum is 30, and the median is the average of the 4th and 5th elements, which must be an integer not in the list.

Let me try to have 9 appear three times. So, 3*9=27, so the remaining five numbers sum to 3. But five positive integers summing to 3 is impossible, as the minimum sum is 5.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps 9 appears two times. So, 2*9=18. Remaining sum is 12, spread over six numbers. Each of these six numbers must be ≤9 and can't appear more than once, because 9 appears twice, and to have 9 as the unique mode, others can appear at most once.

So, six numbers, each at least 1, distinct, summing to 12.

What's the minimal sum for six distinct positive integers? 1+2+3+4+5+6=21, which is more than 12. So, impossible. So, that approach doesn't work.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps 9 appears four times. 4*9=36>30, which is impossible. So, can't have four 9s.

Wait, perhaps n=10. Let me try that.

So, n=10, sum=30. The median is the average of the 5th and 6th elements, which must be an integer not in the list.

Let me try to have 9 appear three times. So, 3*9=27, remaining sum is 3, spread over seven numbers. But seven positive integers summing to 3 is impossible, as the minimal sum is 7.

So, that won't work.

Alternatively, 9 appears two times: 2*9=18, remaining sum is 12, spread over eight numbers. So, eight distinct positive integers summing to 12. The minimal sum is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8=36>12. Impossible.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, maybe the list has 5 elements. But as I thought earlier, n must be even, so n=5 is out.

Wait, n=2. Sum is 30, so two numbers: a and b, summing to 30. The median is the average of a and b, which must be an integer not present. So, (a + b)/2 is an integer, say m, and m is not equal to a or b.

Also, the mode is 9, which must appear more than any other number. But in a list of two numbers, the mode would be the number that appears most frequently. So, both numbers must be 9, but 9+9=18≠30. So, that's impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the list has more numbers, but some of them are repeated, but 9 is the mode.

Wait, let's try n=5, but as I thought before, the median would be the 3rd element, which is in the list, so that's not allowed. So, n must be even.

Let me try n=8 again, but perhaps 9 appears three times, and other numbers are arranged in a way that their sum works.

Wait, n=8, sum=30. So, three 9s: 27. Remaining five numbers sum to 3. Five positive integers summing to 3. Only possible if four of them are 1 and one is -1, but that's not allowed because they're positive integers. So, impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe 9 appears once. But then the mode would have to be another number appearing more than once, which contradicts 9 being the mode. So, that's not possible.

Wait, maybe 9 appears twice, and other numbers appear once. So, let's try n=8, two 9s, sum 18. Remaining six numbers sum to 12. So, six distinct positive integers summing to 12.

The minimal sum for six distinct positive integers is 1+2+3+4+5+6=21>12. So, impossible.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Let me try another approach.

Since the median is an integer not in the list, and it's the average of the two middle numbers, which must add up to an even number.

Let me consider possible medians. Let's say the median is 5, which is an integer not in the list.

So, the two middle numbers must add up to 10, so their average is 5.

So, possible pairs are (1,9), (2,8), (3,7), (4,6), (5,5). But 5 can't be in the list, so (5,5) is invalid. Also, 9 is in the list as the mode. So, if 9 is in the list, then (1,9) would have 9 in the list, but the median is 5, which is not in the list.

Wait, but 9 is the mode, so it must appear more than any other number. So, if 9 is in the list, and appears at least twice, then other numbers can appear at most once.

Wait, let me try to construct a list where the two middle numbers are 4 and 6. So, their sum is 10, average 5, which is not in the list.

So, the list would have four numbers less than or equal to 4, and three numbers greater than or equal to 6, with 9 being the mode.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. Let's say n=6, so sorted list: [a, b, c, d, e, f]. Median is (c + d)/2 =5. So, c + d =10.

Possible pairs (c,d): (4,6), (5,5), etc. But 5 can't be in the list, so (4,6) is possible.

So, the list is [a, b, 4, 6, e, f]. Now, 9 must be the mode, appearing more than any other number.

So, 9 must appear at least twice. Let's say 9 appears twice. Then, other numbers can appear at most once.

So, sum of the list is a + b +4 +6 +e +f =30.

We have two 9s, so e and f could be 9 and 9, but then sum is a + b +4 +6 +9 +9 = a + b +28=30. So, a + b=2.

Since a and b are positive integers, the only possibility is a=1 and b=1. So, the list would be [1,1,4,6,9,9].

Let me check the mode: 1 appears twice, 9 appears twice. So, that's bimodal, which is not allowed. So, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, if 9 appears three times, but in n=6, that would require three 9s. So, a + b +4 +6 +9 +9 = a + b + 28=30 → a + b=2. Again, a=1, b=1. So, list is [1,1,4,6,9,9]. Same problem as before.

Hmm. So, perhaps 9 appears four times, but that's impossible because 4*9=36>30.

Alternatively, let me try a different approach. Let me set the median to be 5, which is not in the list, and the two middle numbers are 4 and 6.

Now, let's have 9 appear three times. So, the list would be [a, b, 4,6,9,9,9]. Wait, but that's seven elements. Hmm, no, let's see.

Wait, n=6: [a, b, 4,6,9,9]. But that's six elements. Wait, 4 and 6 are the middle two, so c=4 and d=6. Then, the list is [a, b,4,6,9,9]. Sum is a + b +4 +6 +9 +9 = a + b +28 =30 → a + b=2. So, a=1, b=1. So, list is [1,1,4,6,9,9]. Again, 1 and 9 both appear twice. Not unique mode.

Hmm, maybe the median is a higher number. Let's say the median is 7, which is not in the list.

So, the two middle numbers must add to 14, so possible pairs are (6,8), (5,9), etc.

But 9 is in the list, so if one of the middle numbers is 9, then the other would be 5, but 5 would have to be in the list as well, but the median is 7, which is not present.

Wait, let's try this. n=6, two middle numbers are 5 and 9, sum 14, average 7, which is not in the list.

So, the list would be [a, b,5,9,c, d]. Wait, but in a sorted list, 5 must be before 9, so the list would be [a, b,5,9,c,d]. Wait, but that can't be because 5 is the third element, 9 is the fourth, then c and d must be >=9.

Wait, but let's think: the list is [a, b,5,9,9,9], but that would make the two middle numbers 5 and9, sum 14, median 7.

But in this case, 9 appears three times. The other numbers are a, b,5, which are <=9.

Wait, sum of the list is a + b +5 +9 +9 +9 = a + b +32=30 → a + b= -2, which is impossible. So, that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the two middle numbers are 6 and8, sum 14, average 7.

So, the list is [a, b,6,8,c,d]. Now, 9 must be in the list as the mode.

Let me try to have three 9s. So, the list would be [a, b,6,8,9,9,9]. Wait, but that's seven elements, which would have a median of the 4th element, which is 8. But 8 is in the list, which violates the condition that the median is not in the list.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, maybe the median is 8, which is not in the list. So, the two middle numbers sum to 16. Possible pairs: (7,9), (8,8), etc. But 8 can't be in the list.

So, let's try (7,9). So, the two middle numbers are 7 and9, sum 16, average 8, which is not in the list.

So, the list would be [a, b,7,9,c,d]. Now, 9 is in the list, and 7 is also present.

Wait, but if 9 is the mode, it must appear more times than any other number.

Let me try to have three 9s. So, the list would be [a, b,7,9,9,9]. Sum is a + b +7 +9 +9 +9 = a + b +34=30 → a + b= -4, which is impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the median is 6. So, the two middle numbers sum to 12. Possible pairs: (5,7), (6,6), etc. 6 can't be in the list.

So, let's try (5,7). So, the list would be [a, b,5,7,c,d]. Now, 9 must be the mode.

Let me try to have three 9s. So, the list becomes [a, b,5,7,9,9,9]. Wait, that's seven elements, so the median is the 4th element, which is7. But 7 is in the list, which violates the condition.

Alternatively, n=6, two middle numbers 5 and7, sum 12, median 6 not in the list.

So, the list is [a, b,5,7,c,d]. 9 must be in the list as the mode.

Let's say 9 appears three times. So, the list is [a, b,5,7,9,9,9]. But that's seven elements, so the median is the 4th element, which is7, which is in the list. Not allowed.

Alternatively, n=6: [a, b,5,7,9,9]. Sum is a + b +5 +7 +9 +9 = a + b +30=30 → a + b=0. Impossible, since a and b are positive integers.

Hmm.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to consider the minimal possible sum for a list where 9 is the unique mode, and the median is an integer not in the list.

Wait, maybe I should think about the minimal case where the sum is 30, and 9 appears more times than others.

Wait, perhaps the minimal case is when 9 appears three times, and other numbers appear once or twice, but less than three times.

But earlier attempts show that with three 9s, the sum is 27, leaving 3 for others, which can't be done without creating another mode.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe 9 appears four times, but that's 36, which is too much.

Alternatively, maybe 9 appears three times, and the other three numbers are 1,1,1, but that gives two modes.

Wait, perhaps the other numbers are arranged in a way that their counts are less than three.

Wait, maybe 9 appears three times, and the other numbers are 1,2,3, each appearing once. Sum is 1+2+3=6, plus 27 gives 33>30. No good.

Alternatively, 9 appears three times, other numbers are 1,1,2. Sum is 4, plus 27=31>30. Still too much.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the list has five elements, but as I thought earlier, that would make the median an element in the list, which is not allowed. So, n must be even.

Wait, let me try n=8 again, but maybe 9 appears three times, and the other five numbers sum to 3, which is impossible. So, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps 9 appears two times, and the other six numbers sum to 12, each appearing once. But earlier, that didn't work because the sum of six distinct numbers is at least 21.

Wait, maybe some of the other numbers are duplicates, but less than two times. Wait, but if 9 appears two times, others can appear at most once to avoid having two modes.

Wait, but if n=8, two 9s sum to 18, and the other six numbers sum to 12. If six numbers sum to 12, each appearing once, the minimal sum is 21, which is more than 12. So, impossible.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing a different approach. Let me think about the problem differently.

Let me assume that the list has n elements, with 9 appearing k times, and the sum is 30.

The median is m, which is an integer not in the list, so m must be between the two middle numbers.

Wait, perhaps the list is arranged such that the two middle numbers are m-1 and m+1, making their average m, which isn't in the list.

Wait, let me try that. Let's say the two middle numbers are m-1 and m+1. Then, their sum is 2m, so the median is m.

So, for example, if m=5, the two middle numbers could be 4 and6.

So, let's try that.

Let me construct a list where the two middle numbers are 4 and6, sum 10, median 5, not in the list.

So, for n=6, the list would be [a, b,4,6,c,d]. Now, 9 must be the mode, so it must appear more times than any other number.

So, let's have two 9s. Then, the sum is a + b +4 +6 +c +d= a + b +c +d +10=30 → a + b +c +d=20.

Now, 9 appears twice, so c and d could be 9 and9, but then sum is 18, so a + b=2. So, a=1, b=1. So, list is [1,1,4,6,9,9].

But then, 1 appears twice, same as 9, so mode is not unique. Not acceptable.

Alternatively, have three 9s. Then, sum contributed by 9s is 27. Remaining three numbers sum to 3, which is 1,1,1. So, list is [1,1,1,4,6,9,9,9]. Wait, that's eight elements. So, the two middle numbers are 1 and4, sum 5, median 2.5, which is not an integer. So, that doesn't work.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the two middle numbers are 3 and7, sum 10, median 5. So, list would be [a, b,3,7,c,d], with 9 appearing three times.

So, 9 appears three times, sum 27. Remaining three numbers sum to 3, which is 1,1,1. So, list is [1,1,1,3,7,9,9,9]. Wait, that's eight elements. The two middle numbers are 1 and3, but wait, no, sorted list would be [1,1,1,3,7,9,9,9]. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me sort it properly.

Wait, sorted list would be [1,1,1,3,7,9,9,9]. So, the two middle numbers are 3 and7, sum 10, median 5, which is not in the list. Also, 9 appears three times, others appear once or three times. Wait, 1 appears three times, same as 9. So, mode isn't unique. Problem again.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the two middle numbers are 2 and8, sum 10, median 5.

So, the list would be [a, b,2,8,c,d], with 9 appearing three times. So, sum is a + b +2 +8 +c +d= a + b +c +d +10=30 → a + b +c +d=20.

9 appears three times, so c and d could be 9,9, and the third 9 elsewhere. Wait, but n=6, so c and d would be the 5th and 6th elements. So, maybe c=9, d=9. So, a + b +9 +9=20 → a + b=2. So, a=1, b=1. So, list is [1,1,2,8,9,9].

Now, check the mode: 1 appears twice, 9 appears twice. So, bimodal. Not allowed.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the two middle numbers are 3 and7, sum 10, median 5. So, the list is [a, b,3,7,c,d]. 9 appears three times, so c and d are 9,9, and another 9. But n=6, so the list would be [a, b,3,7,9,9]. Now, 9 appears twice, but I needed three times. So, maybe a=9 and b=9. So, list is [9,9,3,7,9,9]. Wait, but when sorted, it's [3,7,9,9,9,9]. The two middle numbers are 9 and9, sum 18, median 9, which is in the list. So, that doesn't work.

Wait, this seems impossible. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the median is 6, which is not in the list. So, the two middle numbers sum to 12. Possible pairs: (5,7), (6,6), (4,8), etc. Let's try (5,7).

So, the list is [a, b,5,7,c,d]. 9 appears three times, so c and d are 9,9, and another 9. So, the list would be [a, b,5,7,9,9,9], which is seven elements. The median is the 4th element, which is7. But 7 is in the list, which violates the condition.

Alternatively, n=6, two middle numbers 5 and7, sum 12, median 6. So, the list is [a, b,5,7,c,d]. 9 appears three times, so c and d are 9 and9. So, a + b +5 +7 +9 +9= a + b +30=30 → a + b=0. Impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the two middle numbers are 4 and8, sum 12, median 6. So, the list is [a, b,4,8,c,d]. 9 appears three times, so c and d are9,9, and another 9. But n=6, so the list would be [a, b,4,8,9,9,9], which is seven elements. The median is the 4th element, which is8. But 8 is in the list, which violates the condition.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me consider that the list has two 9s. Then, the sum is 18, leaving 12 for the other four numbers. These four numbers must be distinct (since if any appears twice, it would tie with 9 as mode). So, four distinct positive integers summing to 12.

Possible sets:

1,2,3,6 → sum 12.

So, the list would be [1,2,3,6,9,9]. Sum is 30. Now, let's check the median. Sorted list: [1,2,3,6,9,9]. The two middle numbers are 3 and6, sum 9, median 4.5, which is not an integer. So, that doesn't work.

Another set: 1,2,4,5 → sum 12.

List: [1,2,4,5,9,9]. Sorted, same as above. Middle numbers 4 and5, sum 9, median 4.5. Not integer. Not good.

Another set: 1,3,4,4 → sum 12, but duplicates, which would make mode not unique.

Wait, no, 9 appears twice, so others can appear at most once. So, 4 can't appear twice.

Hmm.

Wait, another possible set: 2,2,3,5 → sum 12, but again, duplicates.

So, only possible set with four distinct numbers is 1,2,3,6 and 1,2,4,5.

Both give median 4.5, which is not an integer. So, that's not acceptable.

Wait, maybe the two middle numbers are both 5, but then median is5, which would have to be in the list. So, that's not allowed.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the two middle numbers are 2 and8, sum 10, median 5.

So, the list would be [a, b,2,8,c,d]. 9 appears three times, so c and d are9,9, and another 9. So, the list would be [a, b,2,8,9,9,9]. That's seven elements. The two middle numbers are 8 and9, sum 17, median 8.5, which is not an integer.

No good.

Wait, perhaps the two middle numbers are 1 and9, sum 10, median5. So, the list is [a, b,1,9,c,d]. 9 appears three times, so c and d are9,9, and another9. So, the list would be [a, b,1,9,9,9,9]. That's eight elements. The two middle numbers are9 and9, sum 18, median9, which is in the list. Not allowed.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the two middle numbers are 3 and7, sum 10, median5.

So, the list is [a, b,3,7,c,d]. 9 appears three times, so c and d are9,9, and another9. So, the list is [a, b,3,7,9,9,9]. That's seven elements. The two middle numbers are7 and9, sum 16, median8, which is not in the list. Wait, but the median is8, which is not in the list. So, let's check the other conditions.

Wait, let me check the sum. a + b +3 +7 +9 +9 +9 = a + b +37=30 → a + b= -7. Impossible. So, that's not possible.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of a list where 9 is the mode, the sum is30, and the median is an integer not in the list.

Let me try the list [5,5,5,5,5,5]. Sum is30, mode is5, but we need mode to be9. So, that's not acceptable.

Alternatively, [6,6,6,6,6,6]. Sum is36>30. No good.

Wait, perhaps [5,5,5,5,5,5] is sum30, but we need mode to be9, so that's not working.

Wait, maybe a list with 9 appearing three times, and other numbers arranged to make the median an integer not in the list.

Wait, perhaps [7,7,9,9,9,0]. Wait, but 0 isn't positive. Can't do that.

Wait, maybe [2,2,9,9,9,7]. Sum is2+2+9+9+9+7=38>30. Not good.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps [3,3,9,9,9,6]. Sum is3+3+9+9+9+6=39>30. No.

Wait, maybe [1,1,9,9,9,10]. Sum is1+1+9+9+9+10=39>30.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps [1,1,9,9,9, x]. Sum is1+1+9+9+9+x=29+x=30 → x=1. So, list is [1,1,1,9,9,9]. Sum is30. Median is (1 +9)/2=5, which is not in the list. But mode is1 and9, both appearing three times. So, not unique mode. Problem.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe [1,2,9,9,9,8]. Sum is1+2+9+9+9+8=38>30. No good.

Wait, perhaps [1,2,3,9,9,14]. Sum is1+2+3+9+9+14=38>30. No.

Hmm, this is frustrating. Maybe I'm missing a simpler approach.

Let me think again about the conditions:

- Sum is30.

- Mode is9, unique.

- Median is an integer not in the list.

So, let's consider the minimal list where 9 is the mode, and the median is an integer not present.

Perhaps the list is [4,4,9,9,9,5]. Wait, but that's six elements. Let me sort it: [4,4,5,9,9,9]. Sum is4+4+5+9+9+9=30.

Median is (5 +9)/2=7, which is not in the list. Good.

Mode is9, which appears three times. 4 appears twice, 5 appears once. So, unique mode. Perfect.

Wait, so the list is [4,4,5,9,9,9]. Sum is30. Median is7, not in the list. Mode is9, unique.

So, the numbers are 4,4,5,9,9,9.

Now, the sum of squares is 4² +4² +5² +9² +9² +9².

Calculating:

4²=16,

5²=25,

9²=81.

So, sum is 16 +16 +25 +81 +81 +81.

Let me compute that:

16+16=32,

32+25=57,

57+81=138,

138+81=219,

219+81=300.

Wait, but that's 300. But wait, let me recount:

Numbers:

4,4,5,9,9,9.

So, 4² +4² +5² +9² +9² +9² = 16 +16 +25 +81 +81 +81.

Compute step by step:

16 +16=32,

32 +25=57,

57 +81=138,

138 +81=219,

219 +81=300.

Yes, sum of squares is 300.

Wait, but let me confirm that the list meets all conditions.

Sum:4+4+5+9+9+9=30. Correct.

Mode:9 appears three times, others appear less. Correct.

Median: (4th +5th)/2 = (9 +9)/2=9. Wait, no! Wait, the sorted list is [4,4,5,9,9,9]. So, the two middle numbers are 5 and9. Their average is (5+9)/2=7, which is not in the list. Correct.

So, that works.

Wait, but earlier when I considered this list, I thought the mode was not unique, but no, 9 appears three times, 4 appears twice, and 5 once. So, unique mode is9. Correct.

So, the sum of squares is 300.


The list must satisfy three conditions: the sum is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer not in the list. After analyzing possible configurations, the list [4, 4, 5, 9, 9, 9] meets all conditions. The sum of the squares of its elements is:

\[
4^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 16 + 16 + 25 + 81 + 81 + 81 = 300
\]

**Answer:** \boxed{300}
