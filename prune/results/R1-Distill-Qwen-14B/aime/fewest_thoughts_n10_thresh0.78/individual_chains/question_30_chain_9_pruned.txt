Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that seems a bit intimidating at first, but maybe I can break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies ω^13 = 1, and all the powers of ω from 0 to 12 are distinct. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.

Looking at the product, each term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Maybe I can factor this expression or find a pattern. Let me try to factor it or see if it relates to something I know.

Wait, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me rearrange it: ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, that looks a bit like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me set x = ω^k, then the expression becomes x² - 2x + 2. So for each k, the term is x² - 2x + 2, where x = ω^k.

So the product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (x² - 2x + 2) evaluated at x = ω^k.

Wait, but the product is over all 13th roots of unity except x=1, since ω ≠ 1. So is there a way to express this product as a value related to a polynomial evaluated at certain points?

I remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product over (x - root) for each root is f(x). But here, it's a product over f(root), where f(x) = x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, so maybe I can relate this to evaluating another polynomial at specific points.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the product as the product of f(ω^k) for k from 0 to 12. Since ω^k are all the 13th roots of unity, including 1 when k=0.

Wait, when k=0, ω^0 = 1, so the term becomes 1² - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So the first term is 1, and the rest are from k=1 to 12, which are the non-1 roots.

So the total product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). So maybe I can write this as the product from k=1 to 12 of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2).

But I'm not sure how to compute this product. Maybe I can consider a generating function or find a relation to cyclotomic polynomials.

Another idea: consider that since ω^13 = 1, ω^{2k} can be written as (ω^k)^2. So each term is (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2. Let me denote y = ω^k, so each term is y² - 2y + 2.

So, the product is the product from k=1 to 12 of (y² - 2y + 2) where y runs over all the 13th roots of unity except y=1.

Wait, so if I consider the product over all y ≠1 of (y² - 2y + 2), that would be equal to the product from k=1 to 12 of (y² - 2y + 2).

But how can I compute this product? Maybe I can relate this to the value of a polynomial evaluated at certain points.

I recall that if you have a polynomial P(x) with roots r1, r2, ..., rn, then the product over (x - ri) is P(x). But here, I'm taking the product over (y² - 2y + 2) for y being the roots of x^13 - 1 = 0, except y=1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this product as the product over (y² - 2y + 2) for y^13 = 1, y ≠ 1.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the product over (y² - 2y + 2) where y^13 = 1, y ≠1, is equal to the product over (y² - 2y + 2) for y being the roots of Φ₁₃(x), the 13th cyclotomic polynomial.

But Φ₁₃(x) is the minimal polynomial for primitive 13th roots of unity, which are exactly the roots y where y^13 = 1 and y ≠ 1. So the product I'm seeking is the product over all y in the roots of Φ₁₃(x) of (y² - 2y + 2).

But how to compute that product? Maybe I can note that if f(y) = y² - 2y + 2, then the product over roots y of Φ₁₃(x) of f(y) is equal to the resultant or something else... Alternatively, perhaps I can consider evaluating the product as the product of f(y) for all roots y of Φ₁₃(x), which is equal to the resultant of Φ₁₃(x) and f(x).

Wait, I'm not very confident about that. Let me think again.

Another approach: instead of working with the product over y, perhaps I can consider that the product over (y² - 2y + 2) for all y^13 =1, y≠1 is equal to the product over y≠1 of (y² - 2y + 2).

So the total product is equal to the product for all y^13=1, y≠1 of (y² - 2y + 2). Let me compute this.

But since y runs over all 13th roots of unity except 1, the product is equal to the
