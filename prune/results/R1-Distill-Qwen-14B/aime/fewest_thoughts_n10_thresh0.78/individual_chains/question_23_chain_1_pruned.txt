Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, and D on a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay.

First, let me recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily at right angles unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals do bisect the angles and are perpendicular to each other. So, that's an important property.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if A and C are two opposite vertices, then the midpoint of AC is the origin. Similarly, the midpoint of BD is the origin. So, if I have point A, then point C is such that the midpoint is (0,0), meaning C is the reflection of A over the origin. So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y).

Same thing with B and D. So, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q). Therefore, the four points of the rhombus are A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), and D(-p, -q).

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the lengths of AB, BC, CD, and DA are the same.

Let me express the coordinates:

A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), D(-p, -q).

So, the sides:

AB: distance between A and B: sqrt[(p - x)² + (q - y)²]
BC: distance between B and C: sqrt[(-x - p)² + (-y - q)²]
CD: distance between C and D: sqrt[(-p + x)² + (-q + y)²]
DA: distance between D and A: sqrt[(x + p)² + (y + q)²]

Since all sides are equal, their squares must be equal. So, let's square them:

AB² = (p - x)² + (q - y)²
BC² = (-x - p)² + (-y - q)²
CD² = (-p + x)² + (-q + y)²
DA² = (x + p)² + (y + q)²

Now, let's compute these:

AB² = (p - x)² + (q - y)² = (p² - 2px + x²) + (q² - 2qy + y²) = (x² + y²) + (p² + q²) - 2(px + qy)

BC² = (-x - p)² + (-y - q)² = (x + p)² + (y + q)² = x² + 2px + p² + y² + 2qy + q² = (x² + y²) + (p² + q²) + 2(px + qy)

CD² = (-p + x)² + (-q + y)² = (x - p)² + (y - q)² = same as AB² but replacing p with -p and q with -q. Wait, actually, (-p + x)² = (x - p)², same as (p - x)², so CD² = (x - p)² + (y - q)² = same as AB². Similarly, DA² is (x + p)² + (y + q)², which is same as BC².

Wait, but that seems a bit conflicting. Let me check. If AB² equals CD², and BC² equals DA², then for all sides to be equal, AB² must equal BC². So:

AB² = BC²

So,

(p - x)² + (q - y)² = (p + x)² + (q + y)²

Let me expand both sides:

Left side: (p² - 2px + x²) + (q² - 2qy + y²) = p² + x² + q² + y² - 2(px + qy)

Right side: (p² + 2px + x²) + (q² + 2qy + y²) = p² + x² + q² + y² + 2(px + qy)

Set left = right:

p² + x² + q² + y² - 2(px + qy) = p² + x² + q² + y² + 2(px + qy)

Subtract (p² + x² + q² + y²) from both sides:

-2(px + qy) = 2(px + qy)

Bring all terms to left:

-2(px + qy) - 2(px + qy) = 0

-4(px + qy) = 0

Divide both sides by -4:

px + qy = 0

So, that's the condition from AB² = BC².

So, the inner product of vectors OA and OB is zero, where O is the origin. Hmm, that's interesting. So, points A and B are such that OA · OB = 0, meaning they are perpendicular. Wait, but OA and OB are vectors from the origin to A and B, right? So, if their dot product is zero, they are perpendicular. So, OA is perpendicular to OB.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular? Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. But in this case, the diagonals are AC and BD. Diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular. So, diagonals are perpendicular, which is consistent with the properties of a rhombus.

But in our case, OA and OB are vectors from the origin to points A and B, which are adjacent vertices of the rhombus. So, if OA is perpendicular to OB, then the adjacent sides are perpendicular, which would make the rhombus actually a square. Hmm, but a square is a special case of a rhombus. So, perhaps not all rhombi have adjacent sides perpendicular, but in this case, it seems that in order for AB² = BC², OA must be perpendicular to OB.

Wait, but in a rhombus, it's the diagonals that are perpendicular, not necessarily the sides. So, perhaps I made a miscalculation here.

Wait, let me think again. If ABCD is a rhombus with sides AB, BC, CD, DA, then the diagonals are AC and BD. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, in this case, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, points A and C are symmetric across the origin, as are points B and D.

So, the diagonals are AC and BD. The diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint, and they are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.

But in terms of points, AC is from A(x, y) to C(-x, -y), so vector AC is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from B(p, q) to D(-p, -q), so vector BD is (-2p, -2q). So, vectors AC and BD are (-2x, -2y) and (-2p, -2q). For them to be perpendicular, their dot product should be zero.

So, (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0

Which simplifies to 4xp + 4yq = 0

Divide both sides by 4:

xp + yq = 0

Which is the same condition as before: px + qy =
