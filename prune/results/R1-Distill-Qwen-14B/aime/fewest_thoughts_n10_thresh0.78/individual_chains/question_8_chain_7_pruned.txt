Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300, and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down.

First, the problem is about finding all possible triples (a, b, c) where each of them is a nonnegative integer. So, a, b, c can be 0 or any positive integer, but they have to add up to 300. That part seems straightforward.

The second condition is the tricky one: a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. Let me try to understand this expression. It looks like a sum of terms where each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another. So, for example, a^2b, a^2c, etc. 

Maybe I can factor this expression somehow to make it easier to handle. Let me see... Let's take the expression:

a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b

I notice that each term has two variables, one squared and one linear. Maybe I can factor by grouping. Let's group terms with similar variables:

a^2b + a^2c = a^2(b + c)
Similarly, b^2a + b^2c = b^2(a + c)
And c^2a + c^2b = c^2(a + b)

So, the entire expression becomes:
a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b)

Hmm, that's a bit simpler. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) as (300 - a), right? Because b + c = 300 - a. Similarly, (a + c) would be 300 - b, and (a + b) would be 300 - c.

Let me try that substitution:
a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000

So, expanding each term:
300a^2 - a^3 + 300b^2 - b^3 + 300c^2 - c^3 = 6,000,000

Now, I can rearrange this as:
300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000

Hmm, maybe I can find a way to relate this to the sum a + b + c. I remember that for three variables, there are some identities involving sums of powers. Let me recall that:

(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)

So, since a + b + c = 300, squaring both sides gives:
300^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)
Which is 90,000 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)

Let me denote S = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 and P = ab + bc + ca. Then, S + 2P = 90,000.

From our earlier equation, 300S - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000.

Wait, I also remember another identity for the sum of cubes:

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc

Let me write that down:

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 300^3 - 3*300*P + 3abc
= 27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc

So, substituting back into our equation:

300S - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc) = 6,000,000
Which simplifies to:
300S - 27,000,000 + 900P - 3abc = 6,000,000

Let me rearrange terms:

300S + 900P - 3abc = 6,000,000 + 27,000,000
Which is:
300S + 900P - 3abc = 33,000,000

Now, let's factor out the 3:

3(100S + 300P - abc) = 33,000,000
Divide both sides by 3:
100S + 300P - abc = 11,000,000

Hmm, okay. So, now I have that equation.

Earlier, I had S + 2P = 90,000. So, S = 90,000 - 2P.

Let me substitute S into the equation above:

100*(90,000 - 2P) + 300P - abc = 11,000,000

Calculate 100*(90,000 - 2P):
= 9,000,000 - 200P

So, substitute back:
9,000,000 - 200P + 300P - abc = 11,000,000
Which simplifies to:
9,000,000 + 100P - abc = 11,000,000

Subtract 9,000,000 from both sides:
100P - abc = 2,000,000

So, 100P - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me write that as:
abc = 100P - 2,000,000

Hmm. So, now I have abc in terms of P.

I remember that P is ab + bc + ca.

So, I have abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor this in terms of a, b, c.

Wait, let me think. Since a + b + c = 300, and a, b, c are nonnegative integers, perhaps I can assume some ordering or find symmetric properties.

Alternatively, maybe try to express in terms of a, b, and c in a way that can be substituted.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of symmetric functions. Let me denote x = a, y = b, z = c. Then, x + y + z = 300, and the other equation is 100(xy + yz + zx) - xyz = 2,000,000.

Wait, that's a key equation: 100(xy + yz + zx) - xyz = 2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this equation or find a substitution.

Let me rearrange it:

xyz - 100(xy + yz + zx) + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, this looks like a cubic equation in three variables. It's not obvious how to factor this, but maybe I can factor it as (x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) = something. Let me check.

Let me consider expanding (x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100):

= xyz - 100xy - 100xz - 100yz + 10,000x + 10,000y + 10,000z - 1,000,000

Hmm, comparing this to our equation:

xyz - 100(xy + yz + zx) + 2,000,000 = 0

It's similar but not the same. Let me write the expanded form:

xyz - 100xy - 100xz - 100yz + 10,000x + 10,000y + 10,000z - 1,000,000 = something.

But in our equation, the coefficients are different. Let me try to see if I can manipulate the equation.

Wait, our equation is:

xyz - 100(xy + yz + zx) + 2,000,000 = 0

If I subtract 10,000(x + y + z) from both sides, perhaps?

Wait, let's see:

xyz - 100(xy + yz + zx) - 10,000(x + y + z) + 2,000,000 + 10,000(x + y + z) = something.

Wait, maybe adding and subtracting terms to make it match the expansion of (x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100). Let's see.

Let me compute (x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100):

= xyz - 100xy - 100xz - 100yz + 10,000x + 10,000y + 10,000z - 1,000,000

So, if I take that expression and subtract 10,000(x + y + z) from it, I get:

xyz - 100xy - 100xz - 100yz + 10,000x + 10,000y + 10,000z - 1,000,000 - 10,000x - 10,000y - 10,000z

Which simplifies to:

xyz - 100xy - 100
