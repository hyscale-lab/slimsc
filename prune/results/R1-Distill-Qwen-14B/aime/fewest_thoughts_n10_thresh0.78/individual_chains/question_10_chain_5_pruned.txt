Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers, and Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. The number of sets Bob has is 2024, and I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me see. So, first, let's parse the problem. Alice picks a set A, which is a set of positive integers. Then Bob creates a list of all finite non-empty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024. We need to find the sum of elements in A.

Wait, so A is a set of positive integers, and Bob is considering all possible finite non-empty sets B where the maximum of B is in A. So, for each element a in A, Bob can form sets B where a is the maximum element. So, for each a in A, how many such sets B are there?

Well, if the maximum element is a, then the other elements of B must be less than or equal to a. Since B is a finite non-empty set, and a is the maximum, the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, right?

Wait, but B is a set, so the other elements can't have duplicates, so it's a subset. So, for each a in A, the number of possible sets B with max(B) = a is 2^(a-1). Because the elements of B can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a}, but since a is the maximum, B must include a, and the rest are subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}. The number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} is 2^(a-1). Each such subset, when combined with {a}, gives a set B with max a.

Therefore, for each a in A, the number of sets B where max(B) = a is 2^(a-1). So, the total number of such sets B is the sum over all a in A of 2^(a-1). 

But Bob's list has 2024 sets, so sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

So, the sum we're looking for is sum_{a in A} a, but we need to find A such that the sum of 2^{a-1} for a in A equals 2024.

So, first, we can think of 2024 as the sum of some powers of 2. Because 2^{a-1} is a power of 2 for each a.

So, the problem reduces to writing 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of 2, and then each exponent plus 1 gives the elements of A. Wait, let's see.

Wait, 2^{a-1} is the term for each a. So, for each a, 2^{a-1} is a term. So
