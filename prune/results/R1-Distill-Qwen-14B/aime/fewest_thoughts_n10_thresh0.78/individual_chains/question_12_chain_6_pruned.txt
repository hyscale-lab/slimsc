Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a 2x3 grid. The task is to figure out how many ways I can fill each cell with a digit (0 through 9) such that two conditions are met. First, when I read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed add up to 999. Second, when I read the grid top to bottom, the three numbers formed add up to 99. 

Hmm, let me try to visualize the grid. It's a 2-row by 3-column grid, so it looks like this:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Each of the letters a, b, c, d, e, f represents a digit. So, the numbers formed left to right are abc and def, right? Wait, no, actually, since it's a 2x3 grid, the first row is a three-digit number, and the second row is another three-digit number. So, the first number is 100a + 10b + c, and the second is 100d + 10e + f. Their sum should be 999.

Then, reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So, the first column is 10a + d, the second is 10b + e, and the third is 10c + f. Their sum should be 99.

Let me write down these equations.

First equation: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

Second equation: (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

I need to find the number of possible digit assignments (a, b, c, d, e, f) that satisfy both equations.

Let me simplify these equations.

Starting with the first equation:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

I can group the terms with similar place values:

(100a + 100d) + (10b + 10e) + (c + f) = 999.

Which factors to:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Hmm, interesting. So, 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Now, the second equation:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Expanding this, we get:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Grouping terms:

(10a + 10b + 10c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Factor out 10:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

So now I have two equations:

1. 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.
2. 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Let me denote some variables to make this simpler.

Let me set:

S1 = a + d,
S2 = b + e,
S3 = c + f.

Then equation 1 becomes:

100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999.  --- Equation (1)

From the second equation:

Let me define T1 = a + b + c,
and T2 = d + e + f.

So equation 2 is:

10 T1 + T2 = 99.  --- Equation (2)

But I also know that T1 = a + b + c,
and T2 = d + e + f.

Wait, but from S1, S2, S3:

S1 = a + d,
S2 = b + e,
S3 = c + f.

So, T1 = a + b + c = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) - (d + e + f) = S1 + S2 + S3 - T2.

But wait, that's getting a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to relate the two.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express a, b, c in terms of S1, S2, S3 and T1, T2.

Wait, maybe it's better to express variables a, d, etc., in terms of S1, S2, S3.

But perhaps I should consider equation (1) and equation (2) together.

Equation (1): 100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999.

Equation (2): 10 T1 + T2 = 99.

But I also know that T1 = a + b + c and T2 = d + e + f.

But from S1, S2, S3:

a = S1 - d,
b = S2 - e,
c = S3 - f.

So,

T1 = (S1 - d) + (S2 - e) + (S3 - f) = S1 + S2 + S3 - (d + e + f) = S1 + S2 + S3 - T2.

So, T1 = S1 + S2 + S3 - T2.

Substituting into equation (2):

10(S1 + S2 + S3 - T2) + T2 = 99.

Expanding that:

10 S1 + 10 S2 + 10 S3 - 10 T2 + T2 = 99.

Which simplifies to:

10 S1 + 10 S2 + 10 S3 - 9 T2 = 99.

But from equation (1): 100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999.

So perhaps I can solve for S3 from equation (1):

S3 = 999 - 100 S1 - 10 S2.

Substituting S3 into the modified equation (2):

10 S1 + 10 S2 + 10*(999 - 100 S1 -10 S2) -9 T2 = 99.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, substitute S3:

10 S1 + 10 S2 + 10*(999 -100 S1 -10 S2) -9 T2 =99.

Expanding the 10*(...):

10 S1 +10 S2 + 9990 -1000 S1 -100 S2 -9 T2 =99.

Now, combine like terms:

(10 S1 -1000 S1) + (10 S2 -100 S2) + 9990 -9 T2 =99.

Which is:

(-990 S1) + (-90 S2) + 9990 -9 T2 =99.

Let me bring all terms to one side:

-990 S1 -90 S2 -9 T2 =99 -9990.

Calculate 99 -9990: that's -9891.

So,

-990 S1 -90 S2 -9 T2 = -9891.

Multiply both sides by (-1):

990 S1 + 90 S2 +9 T2 = 9891.

I can factor out a 9:

9*(110 S1 + 10 S2 + T2) = 9891.

Divide both sides by 9:

110 S1 +10 S2 + T2 = 1099.

So now I have another equation:

110 S1 +10 S2 + T2 =1099. --- Equation (3)

Hmm. Now, from equation (2), we have:

10 T1 + T2 =99.

But T1 = S1 + S2 + S3 - T2.

Wait, but we can express T2 in terms of T1 and the others, but maybe it's better to see if we can express T2 from equation (3) and substitute into equation (2).

Equation (3): 110 S1 +10 S2 + T2=1099.

So, T2 =1099 -110 S1 -10 S2.

Substitute this into equation (2):

10 T1 + (1099 -110 S1 -10 S2) =99.

But T1 is equal to S1 + S2 + S3 - T2.

Wait, but I also have that T1 = a + b + c.

Wait, perhaps I can express T1 in another way.

Alternatively, from S3 =999 -100 S1 -10 S2 (from equation 1), so T1 = a + b + c = (S1 - d) + (S2 - e) + (S3 - f) = S1 + S2 + S3 - (d + e + f) = S1 + S2 + S3 - T2.

So, T1 = S1 + S2 + S3 - T2.

But S3 =999 -100 S1 -10 S2. So,

T1 = S1 + S2 + (999 -100 S1
