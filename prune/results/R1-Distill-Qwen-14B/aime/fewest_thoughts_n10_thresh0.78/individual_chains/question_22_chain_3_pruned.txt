Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. The hexagon is equilateral, which means all its sides are equal in length. Also, it's convex, so none of its internal angles point outwards. Plus, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. That's interesting. So, opposite sides are not only parallel but also equal in length because it's equilateral. Wait, is that necessarily true? Well, if all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, then yes, each pair of opposite sides must be equal in length because they're sides of a hexagon. So, it's like a regular hexagon in terms of opposite sides being parallel and equal, but it's not necessarily regular because the angles might not all be equal.

The problem mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. These extensions form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Let me try to draw this in my mind. Imagine the hexagon ABCDEF, with each side equal. Opposite sides AB and DE are parallel, BC and EF are parallel, and CD and FA are parallel. When we extend AB, CD, and EF, they meet to form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300.

I think this triangle is called the outer triangle or something similar, maybe the triangle formed by the extensions of these sides. So, the hexagon is inscribed inside this triangle, touching all three sides.

Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex, and all opposite sides are parallel, this suggests that the hexagon is a special type of hexagon, perhaps a "truncated" triangle. That is, if you take a triangle and cut off smaller triangles from each corner, you get a hexagon. In this case, since all sides of the hexagon are equal, the truncations must have been done equally on each corner.

Wait, but the original triangle has sides 200, 240, and 300. That's a scalene triangle, so the hexagon inside must have equal sides but angles that correspond to the original triangle's angles.

I remember something about similar triangles and proportions in such cases. Maybe the triangle formed by the extensions is similar to the triangle formed by the hexagon's sides? Or perhaps not, because the hexagon is equilateral but the original triangle is scalene.

Alternatively, I think this problem relates to the concept of a "Carnot's theorem" or something about the distance from the center to the sides, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's more about similar triangles and proportions.

Let me think about the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. Each of these sides is extended until they meet, forming a larger triangle. The hexagon is inside this triangle, with each side of the hexagon being parallel to a side of this triangle.

Wait, no. The sides AB, CD, and EF are being extended; perhaps the triangle is actually larger than the original hexagon. So, the hexagon is sitting inside this triangle, with each pair of opposite sides aligned with the triangle's sides.

Let me try to
