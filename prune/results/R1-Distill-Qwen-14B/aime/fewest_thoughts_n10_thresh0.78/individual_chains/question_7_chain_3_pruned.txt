Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability. I need to find the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then I have to find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. So, first, the octagon has 8 vertices, each colored red or blue independently with a 50-50 chance. The key here is that after some rotation, the blue vertices must align with the red ones. So, essentially, the coloring must be such that it's possible to rotate the octagon so that every blue vertex moves to a position that was previously red.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if I can rotate the octagon so that all blue vertices are now where red ones were, that means the blue set is a rotated version of the red set.

So, another way to think about this is that the colorings must be such that the blue vertices form a rotation of the red vertices. But since it's a regular octagon, rotations correspond to cyclic shifts by some number of positions.

But wait, since the octagon is regular, any rotation by a multiple of 45 degrees (since 360/8 = 45) will map the octagon onto itself. So, possible rotations are by 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째, which correspond to rotating by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions.

So, the problem is asking for the probability that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. Since the red and blue sets are complementary (every vertex is either red or blue), this would imply that the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Wait, but if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, then the red set must be a rotation
