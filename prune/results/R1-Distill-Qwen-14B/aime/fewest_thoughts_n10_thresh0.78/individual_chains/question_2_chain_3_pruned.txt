Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand.

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere up the y-axis. Since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, it's about 86.6% up the y-axis from O to (0,1).

Then there's this family F of segments PQ of unit length. Each PQ is a segment lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, for each such segment PQ in F, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), and the distance between P and Q is 1. So, the distance formula gives sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2) = 1, which simplifies to p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So, all these segments PQ are from the x-axis to the y-axis, in the first quadrant, each of length 1. So, they all lie on the unit circle in the first quadrant, but as segments from (p,0) to (0,q) where p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Now, the problem says there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F except for AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments in F. Because AB goes from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), let's check the length. The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment in F.

So, all other segments in F are different PQs, not AB. The point C is on AB, but it's not A or B, and it's not on any other segment from F. So, our goal is to find OC^2, which will be (x^2 + y^2) where C is (x,y). Then express that as p/q, simplified, and find p + q.

Hmm, so how do I approach this?

First, let's parametrize AB. The line from A(1/2,0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's find the equation of AB.

The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the slope is -sqrt(3). The equation of AB is then y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, any point C on AB can be written as (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2), where t ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Wait, no. Wait, point A is at (1/2, 0), so when x is 1/2, y is 0. Point B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), so when x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2. So, parametric equations can also be written as x = 1/2 - (1/2)s, y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)s, where s ranges from 0 to 1. So, when s=0, we're at A, and s=1, we're at B.

So, that might be useful later.

Now, the key is that point C is on AB, and it's not on any other segment from F except for AB itself. So, for C to not lie on any other PQ in F, except AB, that means that for all other PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

So, suppose we have another PQ in F. PQ connects some point P on the x-axis (p, 0) to Q on y-axis (0, q), with p^2 + q^2 =1. Then, if C is on PQ, then C must satisfy the equation of line PQ.

So, the problem reduces to: find the point C on AB such that there doesn't exist any other PQ in F (i.e., another segment with p^2 + q^2 =1) that passes through C.

So, C can be written as (x, y) on AB. So, for all other PQ in F, except for AB, the line PQ doesn't pass through (x, y).

So, how do we find such a point C? Since AB is already in F, we need to find a point on AB that is not on any other PQ in F.

Alternatively, C is the point on AB that is not on any other segment PQ in F except AB. So, for any other PQ in F, the line PQ doesn't intersect AB at any point except possibly overlapping entirely with AB, which only happens for PQ=AB.

So, perhaps the point C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. Because the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, perhaps the envelope of F is a curve that is tangent to each PQ in F, and the point C is the point where this envelope meets AB.

Wait, but each PQ is a straight line segment, so their envelope might be a curve. Alternatively, maybe the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is the point where AB intersects the envelope of F. Because the envelope would be the boundary of all such PQs.

Wait, let's think about the envelope of the family F. Each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) with p^2 + q^2 =1. So, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/q =1.

But p^2 + q^2 =1.

So
