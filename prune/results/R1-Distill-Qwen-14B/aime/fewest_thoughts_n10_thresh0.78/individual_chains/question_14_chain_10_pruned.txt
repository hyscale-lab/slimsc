Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to find the greatest four-digit number N. The special property of N is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need to find the largest such N with the given property.

The key here is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. That means if I take N, and for each digit position (thousands, hundreds, tens, units), I replace that digit with 1, the new number should be divisible by 7.

So, let me denote N as a four-digit number: let's say N = a b c d, where a, b, c, d are its digits. So, a can't be zero because it's a four-digit number.

Now, if I change a to 1, the number becomes 1 b c d, which must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, changing b to 1 gives a 1 c d, which must be divisible by 7.

Changing c to 1 gives a b 1 d, divisible by 7.

Changing d to 1 gives a b c 1, also divisible by 7.

So, each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

My goal is to find the largest N (so maximize a, then b, then c, then d) such that all four conditions are satisfied.

Hmm, since we're looking for the greatest N, I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards, but that might be too time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this mathematically.

Let me represent N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

When I change a to 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d. Let me call this number N_a. N_a must be divisible by 7.

Similarly:

N_b = 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.

N_c = 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d must be divisible by 7.

N_d = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these must be divisible by 7.

So, for each of these, we can write:

N_a ≡ 0 mod 7

N_b ≡ 0 mod 7

N_c ≡ 0 mod 7

N_d ≡ 0 mod 7

Let me write each condition as a congruence.

First, N_a = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly:

1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Now, perhaps we can compute these mod 7.

Let me calculate 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7.

Calculating:

10 mod 7 = 3.

100 mod 7: 100 /7=14*7=98, remainder 2. So 2.

1000 mod 7: 1000 /7=142*7=994, remainder 6. So 6.

So:

1000 mod7=6

100 mod7=2

10 mod7=3

1 mod7=1.

So, now:

For N_a: 1000*1 + 100b +10c +d ≡ (6*1) + (2b) + (3c) + d ≡ 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7.

Similarly:

N_b: 1000a +100*1 + 10c + d ≡ (6a) + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 6a + 3c + d + 2 ≡ 0 mod7.

N_c: 1000a +100b +10*1 +d ≡ 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 6a + 2b + d +3 ≡ 0 mod7.

N_d: 1000a +100b +10c +1 ≡6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, we have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

3. 6a + 2b + d +3 ≡0 mod7.

4. 6a + 2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

Hmm, that's a system of four equations modulo 7. Let's see how to solve this.

We can write these equations as:

Equation 1: 2b +3c +d ≡ -6 mod7.

Equation 2:6a +3c +d ≡ -2 mod7.

Equation 3:6a +2b +d ≡ -3 mod7.

Equation 4:6a +2b +3c ≡ -1 mod7.

Let me write them as:

1. 2b +3c + d ≡ 1 mod7 (since -6 mod7 is 1).

2.6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7 (since -2 mod7 is 5).

3.6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7 (since -3 mod7 is 4).

4.6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7 (since -1 mod7 is6).

So, equations:

1. 2b +3c + d ≡1 mod7.

2.6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

3.6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

4.6a +2b +
