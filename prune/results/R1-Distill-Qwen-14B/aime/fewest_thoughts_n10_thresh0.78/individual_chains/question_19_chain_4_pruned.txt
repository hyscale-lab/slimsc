Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB times AC.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of triangle centers. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors, and it's the center of the circumscribed circle with radius 13. The incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet, and it's the center of the inscribed circle with radius 6.

The condition given is that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. I should probably draw a diagram to visualize this. Let me imagine triangle ABC with O and I somewhere inside. IA is one of the angle bisectors, and OI is the line connecting the incenter and circumcenter. Since they're perpendicular, maybe there's a right triangle involved here.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula: OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me check that formula. Yes, I think that's correct. So plugging in the values, OI = sqrt(13*(13 - 12)) = sqrt(13*1) = sqrt(13). So the length of OI is sqrt(13).

Now, IA is perpendicular to OI. That means IA and OI form a right angle at point I. So triangle AIO is a right triangle with right angle at I. Wait, no, because IA is a segment from I to A, and OI is from O to I. So the right angle is at I between IA and OI. So that would make triangle AIO a right triangle with legs IA and IO, and hypotenuse AO.

Wait, AO is the distance from A to O, which is the circumradius, right? Because O is the circumcenter, so OA = OB = OC = 13. So AO is 13. So in triangle AIO, we have legs IA, IO, and hypotenuse AO.

So triangle AIO is a right triangle with hypotenuse AO = 13 and legs IA and IO. We know IO is sqrt(13), as I calculated earlier. So we can find IA using the Pythagorean theorem.

Let me write that down:

IA² + IO² = AO²

Plugging in the known values:

IA² + (sqrt(13))² = 13²

Simplify:

IA² + 13 = 169

So IA² = 169 - 13 = 156

Therefore, IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Hmm, okay.

But how does this help me find AB * AC? I need to relate IA to the sides of the triangle.

Wait, IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. I wonder if there's a formula that relates the length of the inradius to the distances from the incenter to the
