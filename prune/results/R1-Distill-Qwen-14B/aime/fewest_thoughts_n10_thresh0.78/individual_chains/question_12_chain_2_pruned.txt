Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out how many ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits (0-9) such that two conditions are met. The first condition is that when you read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed add up to 999. The second condition is that when you read the grid top to bottom, the three numbers formed add up to 99. 

Hmm, let me try to visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, which means there are two rows and three columns. So, the first row will form a three-digit number, and the second row will form another three-digit number. When these two are added together, they should equal 999. 

Additionally, each column, when read top to bottom, forms a two-digit number (since there are two rows). The sum of these three two-digit numbers should be 99. 

Let me denote the grid cells as follows:

a b c  
d e f

So, the first number is abc (a three-digit number, 100a + 10b + c), and the second number is def (100d + 10e + f). Their sum should be 999, so:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Simplifying that:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Now, looking at the sum of the column-wise numbers. The first column is ad, which is 10a + d. The second column is be, which is 10b + e. The third column is cf, which is 10c + f. Their sum should be 99:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Simplifying:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

So now I have two equations:

1) 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999

2) 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Hmm, let me try to see if I can find relationships between these equations.

Let me denote S1 = a + d, S2 = b + e, S3 = c + f. Then equation 1 becomes:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Now, equation 2: Let me denote T1 = a + b + c, T2 = d + e + f. So equation 2 becomes:

10*T1 + T2 = 99.

But I also notice that T1 + T2 = (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = S1 + S2 + S3.

So T1 + T2 = S1 + S2 + S3.

But from equation 1, S1*100 + S2*10 + S3 = 999.

I wonder if I can express T1 and T2 in terms of S1, S2, S3.

Wait, equation 2 is 10*T1 + T2 = 99, and equation 3 is T1 + T2 = S1 + S2 + S3.

So let me write these two equations:

Equation A: 10*T1 + T2 = 99

Equation B: T1 + T2 = S = S1 + S2 + S3

Where S is the sum of S1, S2, S3.

But from equation A, I can express T2 as T2 = 99 - 10*T1.

Substituting into equation B:

T1 + (99 - 10*T1) = S

Simplify:

-9*T1 + 99 = S

So S = 99 - 9*T1.

But S is S1 + S2 + S3.

I also have from equation 1:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Hmm. So I have S1, S2, S3, and T1.

Let me see if I can relate these.

We have S = S1 + S2 + S3 = 99 - 9*T1.

So, S1 + S2 + S3 = 99 - 9*T1.

But also, equation 1 is 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Let me try to express equation 1 as:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

I can write this as:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

But from equation 1, if I think of this as a three-digit number S1S2S3, it would be 999. Wait, that might not be directly helpful.

Wait, but 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999, which is a three-digit number. So S1 must be 9 because 100*9 = 900. Then, 10*S2 + S3 = 99.

Wait, let me check that.

If S1 = 9, then 100*9 = 900. Then 10*S2 + S3 = 99.

But 10*S2 + S3 = 99. So S2 must be 9 and S3 must be 9, because 10*9 + 9 = 99.

Wait, but 10*S2 + S3 =99. So S2 is the tens digit and S3 is the units digit, so S2 can be from 0 to 9, but their combination must be 99. So S2=9 and S3=9.

So, S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

Wait, but let me confirm that.

Because 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

So if S1=9, then 100*9=900. Then 10*S2 + S3=99. So yes, 10*S2 + S3=99. So S2 must be 9, and S3 must be 9, because 10*9+9=99. So S3=9.

So S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.
