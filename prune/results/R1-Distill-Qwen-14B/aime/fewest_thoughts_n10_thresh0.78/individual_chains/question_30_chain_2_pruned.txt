Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe I can break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when working with cyclotomic polynomials. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity (since it's not equal to 1), it satisfies the equation ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial over the integers is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial.

The cyclotomic polynomial Φ_n(x) for prime n is given by Φ_p(x) = x^{p-1} + x^{p-2} + ... + x + 1. So for 13, it's Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. That might come in handy later.

Now, looking at the product: ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me see if I can simplify each term in the product. Each term is of the form 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me factor or rearrange this.

Wait, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} can be rewritten as (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Maybe I can factor this as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me consider x = ω^k. Then the term becomes x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, can I factor that? Let's see, discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so it's x² - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, it factors into linear terms with complex coefficients. But ω^k is a root of unity, so maybe that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate this product to some polynomial evaluated at a certain point. Since the product is over all 13th roots of unity except 1, perhaps it's related to the cyclotomic polynomial.

Wait, the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_13(x) is the product of (x - ω^k) for k=1 to 12, because ω^0 = 1 is excluded. But in my product, each term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}), which is a quadratic in ω^k. Maybe if I consider evaluating a certain polynomial at x=2 or something?

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the product as ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Since ω^0 = 1, when k=0, the term is (1 - 2 + 2) = 1. So the product is 1 times the product from k=1 to 12 of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). So maybe I can focus on that part.

Let me denote x = ω^k, so x varies over all 13th roots of unity except x=1.
