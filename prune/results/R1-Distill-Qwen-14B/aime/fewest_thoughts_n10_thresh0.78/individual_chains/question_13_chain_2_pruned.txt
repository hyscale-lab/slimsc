Okay, so I need to solve this math problem about Aya's morning walk. Let me read it carefully again.

Every morning, Aya walks 9 kilometers and stops at a coffee shop. Her walking speed is s kilometers per hour. When she walks at this speed, the entire walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes she spends in the coffee shop. Then, when she walks at s + 2 km/h, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, still including t minutes in the coffee shop. Now, they want to know how long her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including t minutes again.

Hmm, so first, I should figure out the relationship between her walking speed and the time she takes. The key here is that the walking time plus the coffee shop time equals the total time given.

Let me break it down. The time she spends walking is distance divided by speed. The distance is 9 km. So, the walking time when her speed is s km/h is 9/s hours. Similarly, when she walks at s + 2 km/h, the walking time is 9/(s + 2) hours.

But the total time includes t minutes. Since the times are given in hours and minutes, I need to convert everything to the same unit. Let me convert t minutes to hours. So, t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, for the first scenario:
Walking time + coffee time = total time
9/s + t/60 = 4 hours.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the total time is 4 hours, which includes the walking time and the coffee time. So, the equation should be:
Walking time + coffee time = total time
Which is 9/s + t/60 = 4.

Similarly, for the second scenario:
9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2 hours and 24 minutes.

Wait, 2 hours and 24 minutes is 2 + 24/60 hours. Let me compute that: 24/60 is 0.4, so 2.4 hours.

So, the second equation is:
9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4.

So now I have two equations with two variables, s and t. I can solve these two equations to find s and t.

Let me write them down:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4
2) 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

Hmm, so I can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate t. Let me do that.

First equation minus second equation:

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s + 2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4
Simplify:
9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

So, 9 (1/s - 1/(s + 2)) = 1.6

Let me compute 1/s - 1/(s + 2):
