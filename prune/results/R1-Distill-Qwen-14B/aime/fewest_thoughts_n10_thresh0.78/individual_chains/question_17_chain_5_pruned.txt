Alright, so I've got this math problem here about rectangular boxes, their surface area and volume, and finding the smallest sphere that can contain them. The goal is to find r squared, where r is the radius of that sphere. Then express r² as a fraction p/q, with p and q coprime, and finally find p+q. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, the problem mentions a set B of rectangular boxes. Each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. So, for any box in B, its surface area is 54, and its volume is 23. We need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any such box, which essentially means we need to find the maximum possible space diagonal of these boxes. The sphere's diameter will be equal to the space diagonal of the box, so the radius will be half of that. Therefore, r is half the space diagonal, so r squared will be (diagonal²)/4.

So, the first step is to figure out the space diagonal of a rectangular box. The formula for the space diagonal (d) is sqrt(l² + w² + h²), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height of the box. Therefore, d² = l² + w² + h². And r² = d² / 4 = (l² + w² + h²)/4.

Our task reduces to minimizing (l² + w² + h²)/4, given that the surface area is 54 and volume is 23. Because we need the smallest possible sphere, which would correspond to the box with the minimal space diagonal in the set B.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, no. Since we have multiple boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, the sphere must contain all of them. So, the sphere's radius must be large enough to contain the box with the maximum space diagonal in set B. Therefore, we need to find the maximum possible value of the space diagonal for boxes in B, and then set r as half of that. So, actually, we need to maximize (l² + w² + h²) subject to the constraints of surface area 54 and volume 23.

Hmm, okay, that's a crucial point. So, I need to maximize l² + w² + h² given that 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 and lwh = 23.

So, the constraints are:
1. 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 ⇒ lw + lh + wh = 27
2. lwh = 23

We need to maximize l² + w² + h². 

I recall that for a given surface area and volume, the expression l² + w² + h² is maximized when the box is as "stretched out" as possible, perhaps when one dimension is as large as possible, and the others are as small as possible, subject to the constraints.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to use Lagrange multipliers to maximize the function f(l, w, h) = l² + w² + h² with the constraints g(l, w, h) = 2(lw + lh + wh) - 54 = 0 and h(l, w, h) = lwh - 23 = 0.

Let's try setting up the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian function would be:

L = l² + w² + h² - λ(2(lw + lh + wh) - 54) - μ(lwh - 23)

Take partial derivatives with respect to l, w, h, λ, and μ, set them equal to zero.

Partial derivative with respect to l:

dL/dl = 2l - λ(2w + 2h) - μ(wh) = 0

Similarly, partial derivative with respect to w:

dL/dw = 2w - λ(2l + 2h) - μ(lh) = 0

Partial derivative with respect to h:

dL/dh = 2h - λ(2l + 2w) - μ(lw) = 0

And the constraints:

2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 ⇒ lw + lh + wh = 27

lwh = 23

So, we have the four equations:

1. 2l - 2λ(w + h) - μ wh = 0
2. 2w - 2λ(l + h) - μ lh = 0
3. 2h - 2λ(l + w) - μ lw = 0
4. lw + lh + wh = 27
5. lwh = 23

Hmm, this is a system of five equations with five variables: l, w, h, λ, μ. Solving this system might be complicated, but maybe we can find some symmetry or assume two variables are equal.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to make a substitution. Let me consider the case where two variables are equal. Let's say l = w. Then, we can reduce the number of variables.

Let’s assume l = w. Then, let’s denote l = w = x, and h = y.

Then, the constraints become:

2(x² + 2xy) = 54 ⇒ x² + 2xy = 27

Volume constraint: x² y = 23 ⇒ y = 23 / x²

Substituting y into the first equation:

x² + 2x*(23/x²) = 27 ⇒ x² + 46/x = 27

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate denominator:

x³ + 46 = 27x ⇒ x³ -27x +46 =0

So, we need to solve the cubic equation x³ -27x +46 =0.

Let me try to find rational roots. By Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are divisors of 46: ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46 =20 ≠0

x=2: 8 -54 +46
