Alright, so I've been given this problem about finding the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. A number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are satisfied: first, when n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits; second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

Let me try to unpack this step by step. 

First, I need to understand what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number is represented as 'ab' where 'a' is the digit in the b's place and 'b' is the unit's place. But wait, actually, in base b, the two-digit number would be something like 'd1 d0', where d1 is the coefficient for b^1 and d0 is the coefficient for b^0. So the numerical value of such a number is d1*b + d0. 

Now, since it's a two-digit number in base b, the first digit d1 can't be zero, right? Because then it would be a one-digit number. So d1 must be at least 1 and at most b-1. Similarly, d0 can be from 0 to b-1. 

The problem states that the sum of the two digits, d1 + d0, is equal to the square root of n, which is sqrt(n). But n is equal to d1*b + d0. So we can write:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1*b + d0)

Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0

Expanding the left side gives:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0

Let me rearrange the equation:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0

Hmm, this looks a bit messy, but maybe I can factor or rearrange terms to make it more manageable.

Let me group terms by d1:

d1^2 + (2*d0 - b)*d1 + (d0^2 - d0) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of d1. Let me denote this as:

d1^2 + (2d0 - b)d1 + (d0^2 - d0) = 0

Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the discriminant of this quadratic must be a perfect square for d1 to be an integer. Let me compute the discriminant D:

D = (2d0 - b)^2 - 4*(1)*(d0^2 - d0)

Expanding this:

D = (4d0^2 -4b d0 + b^2) - 4d0^2 +4d0

Simplify:

4d0^2 -4b d0 + b^2 -4d0^2 +4d0 = (-4b d0 +4d0) + b^2

Factor out -4d0:

= -4d0(b -1) + b^2

So D = b^2 -4d0(b -1)

For the quadratic equation to have integer solutions, D must be a perfect square. Let me denote D = k^2, where k is a non-negative integer.

So:

b^2 -4d0(b -1) = k^2

Hmm, let's rearrange this:

b^2 - k^2 =4d0(b -1)

Which factors as:

(b -k)(b +k) =4d0(b -1)

So (b -k)(b +k) must be equal to 4d0(b -1). Since d0 is a digit in base b, d0 can be from 0 to b-1. But since d0 is part of a two-digit number, d0 can't be equal to b, so d0 is less than b.

Furthermore, d0 is a digit, so it's between 0 and b-1. However, if d0 is 0, then the two-digit number would be d1* b + 0, and d1 +0 = sqrt(n). But n would be d1*b, so sqrt(n) = d1, which implies that d1*b = d1^2. So d1*b = d1^2 → d1 = b, but d1 must be less than b in base b. So this is impossible unless d1 =0, which it can't be. So d0 can't be 0. Therefore, d0 is between 1 and b-1.

So, going back, we have (b -k)(b +k) =4d0(b -1). Since d0 is between 1 and b-1, 4d0(b-1) is between 4(b-1) and 4(b-1)(b-1) =4(b-1)^2.

So (b -k)(b +k) must be in that range.

But since b -k and b +k are both positive integers (since k < b, because D must be positive for real solutions, and b^2 > k^2). So, we can consider that (b -k) and (b +k) are positive factors of 4d0(b -1). 

Additionally, since (b -k) and (b +k) are factors of 4d0(b-1), and their product is 4d0(b-1). Also, (b -k) and (b +k) have a sum of 2b and a difference of 2k. 

So, we can write:

(b -k) * (b +k) =4d0(b -1)

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe we can consider possible values of d0 and then see if (b -k)(b +k) divides into 4d0(b-1).

Alternatively, perhaps we can express 4d0(b-1) as a product of two factors s and t where s = b -k and t = b +k, so that s < t and s * t =4d0(b-1). Then, from s and t, we can solve for b and k:

s + t = 2b → b = (s + t)/2

t - s = 2k → k = (t - s)/2

So both (s + t) must be even, and (t - s) must be even, which implies that s and t must be both even or both odd. But since s * t =4d0(b-1), which is a multiple of 4, so s and t must both be even. Because if they were both odd, their product would be odd, but 4d0(b-1) is even. Therefore, s and t are both even.

So, let me set s = 2m and t = 2n, where m and n are positive integers. Then, s * t =4 m n =4d0(b-1). So m n =d0 (b -1).

Also, since s =2m and t=2n, then:

b = (s + t)/2 = (2m +2n)/2 = m + n

k = (t -s)/2 = (2n -2m)/2 =n -m

Additionally, since t =2n must be greater than s=2m, we have n > m.

So, substituting b = m +n and into m n = d0 (b -1):

m n =d0 ( (m +n) -1 ) =d0(m +n -1)

So,

m n = d0 (m +n -1 )

We can rearrange this as:

m n - d0 (m +n) +d0 =0

Hmm, this equation relates m, n, and d0. Since d0 is between 1 and b-1, and b = m +n, so d0 is between 1 and m +n -1.

But since d0 is a digit, d0 is at least 1 and at most b-1 = m +n -1.

Thus, for each possible d0, maybe we can find m and n such that m n = d0(m +n -1).

Alternatively, perhaps we can express this as:

m n =d0(m +n -1)

Let me rearrange:

m n -d0 m -d0 n +d0 =0

Adding d0^2 to both sides:

m n -d0 m -d0 n +d0 +d0^2 =d0^2

Factor the left side:

(m -d0)(n -d0) = d0^2 -d0 

Wait, let's check that:

(m -d0)(n -d0) = mn -d0 m -d0 n +d0^2

But our left side after adding d0^2 is mn -d0 m -d0 n +d0 +d0^2 = (mn -d0 m -d0 n +d0^2) +d0 = (m -d0)(n -d0) +d0

Hmm, maybe that's not the best way. Alternatively, perhaps factor differently.

Wait, let me try:

m n -d0 m -d0 n +d0 =0

Adding 1 to both sides:

m n -d0 m -d0 n +d0 +1 =1

Then, factor:

(m -d0)(n -d0) = d0 +1 -1 =d0

Wait, let me check:

(m -d0)(n -d0) = mn -d0 m -d0 n +d0^2

But our left side is mn -d0 m -d0 n +d0 =0

So,

(m -d0)(n -d0) =d0^2 -d0

So,

(m -d0)(n -d0) =d0(d0 -1)

So,

(m -d0)(n -d0) =d0(d0 -1)

That's a nice equation because now we can think of m and n as being shifted by d0, and the product is d0(d0 -1). Since m and n are positive integers with n > m, and d0 is also a positive integer (since d0 >=1), we can perhaps find pairs (m, n) for each d0.

So, for each d0, the possible factor pairs of d0(d0 -1) give us (m -d0, n -d0). Since d0(d0 -1) is the product, and m < n, we can let (m -d0) and (n -d0) be positive integers or zero? Wait, no. Because m and n are positive integers, and m < n.

Wait, m must be less than n, but m and n are related to b =m +n, which is at least 2 (since base can't be 1). So considering that:

Since m and n are positive integers, and d0 is at least 1, (m -d0) could be negative? Hmm, let's see.

Wait, if m - d0 is negative, then m < d0. Similarly for n -d0. But since their product is d0(d0 -1), which is positive (since d0 >=1, so d0(d0 -1) is non-negative. Wait, when d0=1, d0(d0 -1)=0. Hmm, so for d0=1, (m -1)(n -1)=0. So either m=1 or n=1.

But let's consider d0 >=1:

If d0 =1, then (m -1)(n -1)=0. So either m=1 or n=1. But since m < n, and both are positive integers, m=1 and n >=2.

So, for d0=1, we can have m=1 and n >=2. Then, b = m +n =1 +n, and d0=1. So, the two-digit number in base b is d1 d0, where d1 = m =1, d0=1.

Wait, but let me clarify: Remember that m and n are such that m = (b -k)/2, n = (b +k)/2. Wait, no, earlier substitution was s=2m and t=2n, so m and n are related to s and t, which are factors of 4d0(b -1). Maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed for each d0 and see what possible m and n can be.

But perhaps the better approach is to iterate over possible d0 and find all possible (m, n) pairs.

Given that (m -d0)(n -d0)=d0(d0 -1), and m <n, and m, n positive integers.

Let me consider d0 starting from 1 upwards.

Case 1: d0=1.

Then (m -1)(n -1)=1*0=0. So either m=1 or n=1. But since m <n, m=1 and n can be any integer greater than 1. But n must be a positive integer.

So, for d0=1, possible pairs (m, n) are (1, n), where n >=2.

Then, since b =m +n, for each such pair, b=1 +n.

But what is n? Remember that in this case, the two-digit number is d1 d0 in base b, where d1 = m, and d0=1. But m is 1, so d1=1. So the number is 1* b +1 =b +1. The sum of digits is 1 +1=2. So, sqrt(n) must equal 2, so n=4.

But wait, n is supposed to be d1*b +d0 =1*b +1 =b +1. So for n=4, we have b+1=4 → b=3.

So, in this case, d0=1 gives b=3, and the number is 11_3 which is 1*3 +1=4, and 1+1=2= sqrt(4). So that's valid.

So for d0=1, we get one solution: b=3.

Case 2: d0=2.

Then, (m -2)(n -2)=2*1=2.

Possible factor pairs of 2 are (1,2). Since 2 is prime, so 1*2=2. So,

m -2=1 →m=3

n -2=2 →n=4

Alternatively, m -2=2 and n -2=1, but since m <n, we don't consider that.

So the only possible pair is (3,4). Then, b=m +n=3+4=7.

Now, let's check: The two-digit number in base 7 is d1 d0, where d1=m=3, d0=2. So the number is 3*7 +2=23. The sum of digits is 3+2=5. sqrt(23) is approximately 4.795, which is not 5. So, this doesn't hold. Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, did I make a mistake here? Because according to the equation, (m -d0)(n -d0)=d0(d0 -1). So for d0=2, (m-2)(n-2)=2, and I found m=3, n=4. Then, b=7.

But then, d1=m=3, d0=2. The number is 3*7 +2=23. Sum is 5, and sqrt(23)
