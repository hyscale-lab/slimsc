Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to understand what's going on.

Every day, Aya walks 9 kilometers. She stops at a coffee shop after her walk and spends some time there, which is t minutes. The problem gives me two different scenarios about her walking speed and the total time she takes, including the time in the coffee shop. I need to find out how long her walk would take if she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, again including the t minutes at the coffee shop.

Hmm, so let's break it down. First, I should probably figure out what s is. Because without knowing her speed, I can't calculate the time for the third scenario.

In the first scenario, she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, and the total time taken is 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. So, the walking time plus the coffee shop time equals 4 hours.

Wait, but how long does she spend walking alone? Since she walks 9 km at s km/h, the time she spends walking is distance divided by speed. So that's 9 / s hours. Then she spends t minutes at the coffee shop. But the total time is 4 hours, which is in hours. I need to convert t minutes into hours so that all the units match.

Yes, t minutes is t/60 hours. So the total time is walking time plus coffee time: (9/s) + (t/60) = 4. That's equation one.

In the second scenario, she walks at s + 2 km/h. The total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Again, I'll convert that into hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So the total time is 2.4 hours.

So, walking time at s + 2 km/h is 9/(s + 2) hours. Plus the coffee time t/60 hours equals 2.4 hours. So equation two is (9/(s + 2)) + (t/60) = 2.4.

Now I have two equations:

1) (9/s) + (t/60) = 4
2) (9/(s + 2)) + (t/60) = 2.4

I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t. Let's see:

Equation 1 - Equation 2:
[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s + 2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4

Simplify:
9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Factor out the 9:
9[1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Let me compute the difference in the reciprocals:
1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So substituting back:
9 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 1.6

Multiply both sides by s(s + 2) to eliminate the denominator:
9 * 2 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

Simplify left side: 18 = 1.6 s(s + 2)

Let me write that as:
1.6 s(s + 2) = 18

Divide both sides by 1.6 to solve for s(s + 2):
s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6

Calculate 18 divided by 1.6. Hmm, 1.6 is 8/5, so dividing by 8/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/8.

18 * (5/8) = (18*5)/8 = 90/8 = 11.25

So s(s + 2) = 11.25

Let me write that as a quadratic equation:
s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Now, solving for s using quadratic formula. The quadratic is s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0.

The quadratic formula is s = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

Here, a = 1, b = 2, c = -11.25.

Discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (2)^2 - 4(1)(-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49

Wait, 4 + 45 is 49? Wait, 4 + 45 is 49. Correct. So sqrt(49) is 7.

So s = [-2 ± 7]/2

Two solutions: (-2 +7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5; (-2 -7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5

Since speed can't be negative, s = 2.5 km/h.

Wait, but let me double-check that. If s is 2.5, then s + 2 is 4.5.

Let me verify the first scenario: walking at 2.5 km/h, time is 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours, which is 3 hours and 36 minutes. Then coffee time is t minutes. Total time is 4 hours, so 3h36m + t minutes = 4h0m. So t is 24 minutes, because 4h0m - 3h36m = 24 minutes.

Now the second scenario: walking at 4.5 km/h. Time is 9 / 4.5 = 2 hours. So 2 hours walking plus t (24) minutes coffee. So total time is 2h24m, which matches the given info. So that's correct. So s is indeed 2.5 km/h, and t is 24 minutes.

Now the question asks: Suppose Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

s is 2.5, so s + 1/2 is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

So walking speed is 3 km/h.

Walking time is 9 / 3 = 3 hours.

Plus t minutes, which is 24 minutes. So total time is 3 hours plus 24 minutes.

Convert 3 hours to minutes: 180 minutes. So 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

So the total time is 204 minutes.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps:

1. Set up two equations based on the given scenarios.
2. Subtracted the equations to eliminate t and solve for s.
3. Found s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes.
4. Then, calculated the time when speed is s + 1/2 = 3 km/h.
5. Walking time is 3 hours, add 24 minutes for coffee, total 204 minutes.

Yes, that seems correct.


Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning and stops at a coffee shop, spending t minutes there. We are given two scenarios with different walking speeds and total times, including coffee time. By setting up equations based on the given information, we solve for her walking speed (s) and the coffee time (t). 

From the first scenario:
\[
\frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
From the second scenario:
\[
\frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
\]
Subtracting the second equation from the first eliminates t:
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = 1.6
\]
Simplifying:
\[
9 \left( \frac{2}{s(s+2)} \right) = 1.6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{18}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
\]
Solving for \(s\):
\[
s(s+2) = \frac{18}{1.6} = 11.25 \quad \Rightarrow \quad s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
\]
Using the quadratic formula:
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
The positive solution is \(s = 2.5\) km/h. Substituting back, the coffee time \(t = 24\) minutes.

When Aya walks at \(s + \frac{1}{2} = 3\) km/h:
\[
\text{Walking time} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]
Including coffee time:
\[
\text{Total time} = 180 + 24 = 204 \text{ minutes}
\]

The final answer is \(\boxed{204}\).
