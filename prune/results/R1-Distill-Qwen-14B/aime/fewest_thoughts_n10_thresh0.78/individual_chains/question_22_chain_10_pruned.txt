Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon. Hmm, where to start...

First, let me recall what a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel means. Convex means all internal angles are less than 180 degrees, and equilateral means all sides are of equal length. Opposite sides being parallel adds another property, so it's not just any regular hexagon but one with a specific structure.

I remember that in such hexagons, when you extend the sides AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. Similarly, extending BC, DE, and FA would form another triangle. Maybe these triangles are similar or have some proportional relationship with the hexagon.

The given triangle has sides 200, 240, and 300. Wait, those numbers look familiar. Let me check if they form a Pythagorean triple. 200² + 240² = 40000 + 57600 = 97600. 300² is 90000, which is less than 97600, so it's not a right triangle. Hmm, maybe it's a scaled version of some smaller triangle.

But maybe I can think in terms of similar triangles or ratios. Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the extensions of AB, CD, EF would meet at a point, forming a larger triangle outside the hexagon. Similarly, the other three sides would form another triangle.

I think the key here is to realize that the hexagon can be considered as a truncated version of the larger triangle. So the triangle with sides 200, 240, 300 is the outer triangle, and the hexagon is a part of it, with each side of the hexagon being a segment cut off from each side of the triangle.

Wait, but how exactly? Let me visualize this. If I have a large triangle, and from each side, I cut off a smaller triangle, each cut being parallel to another side. But in this case, the hexagon has three pairs of opposite sides, each pair being parallel. So maybe each
