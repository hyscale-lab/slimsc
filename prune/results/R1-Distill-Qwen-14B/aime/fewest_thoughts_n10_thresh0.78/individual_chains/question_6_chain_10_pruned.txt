Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It looks a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step. The problem is about finding the number of intersections between two graphs. The graphs are given by the equations:

y = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))

and

x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))

First, I need to understand what f(x) and g(x) are. The functions are defined as:

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|

g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

Hmm, these are nested absolute value functions. Let me try to visualize each function separately.

Starting with f(x):

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. 

The inner absolute value |x| makes it a V-shape graph with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2 shifts it down, but since we take the absolute value again, it will create a W-shape. Wait, actually, let's plot it step by step.

Let me consider f(x):

1. Start with |x|, which is a V-shape with vertex at (0,0).
2. Subtract 1/2: |x| - 1/2. This shifts the graph down by 1/2. The vertex is now at (0, -1/2). But since it's inside another absolute value, any negative parts will flip up.
3. So, ||x| - 1/2| will reflect any part below the x-axis back up. 

Let me think about the points where |x| - 1/2 is zero. That happens when |x| = 1/2, so x = ±1/2. So between x = -1/2 and x = 1/2, the expression |x| -1/2 is negative, so the outer absolute value will make it positive. 

So, for x between -1/2 and 1/2, f(x) = (1/2 - |x|). That's a V-shape pointing downward with vertices at (-1/2, 0) and (1/2, 0), and reaching a maximum at (0, 1/2).

Wait, no, actually, since f(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/2|, let's consider it piecewise.

For x ≥ 0, |x| = x, so f(x) = |x - 1/2|. So for x ≥ 1/2, it's x - 1/2, which is a line with slope 1 starting at (1/2, 0). For x between 0 and 1/2, it's 1/2 - x, a line with slope -1, going from (0, 1/2) to (1/2, 0). Similarly, for x ≤ 0, |x| = -x, so f(x) = |-x - 1/2| = |x + 1/2|. So for x ≤ -1/2, it's -x -1/2, which for x negative, would be a line with slope 1 (since x is negative, -x is positive). Wait, but when x is negative, say x = -1, then |x| is 1, so f(x) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2. Wait, perhaps I should plot a few points.

Let me tabulate some values for f(x):

x | |x| | |x| - 1/2 | ||x| -1/2|
---|-----|---------|----------
0 | 0   | -1/2    | 1/2
1/2 | 1/2 | 0       | 0
1 | 1   | 1/2     | 1/2
-1/2 | 1/2 | 0       | 0
-1 | 1   | 1/2     | 1/2

So f(x) has a V-shape with minima at x = ±1/2 (both giving f(x)=0) and maxima at x=0, x=±1, etc., giving f(x)=1/2.

So the graph of f(x) is a diamond shape (like a V on both sides) with vertices at (1/2, 0), (-1/2, 0), and (0, 1/2). Similarly, it's symmetric about the y-axis.

Similarly, let's look at g(x):

g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

Again, piecewise.

For x ≥ 0: |x| = x, so g(x) = |x - 1/4|.

So when x ≥ 1/4, g(x) = x - 1/4, slope 1.

When 0 ≤ x ≤ 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - x, slope -1.

Similarly, for x < 0: |x| = -x, so g(x) = |-x -1/4| = |x + 1/4|.

Which for x ≤ -1/4, it's |x +1/4|, which for x negative, let's see:

If x ≤ -1/4, then x +1/4 ≤ 0, so |x +1/4| = -(x +1/4) = -x -1/4. So slope is -1.

Wait, no, for x ≤ -1/4, |x +1/4| is -x -1/4 because x +1/4 is negative. So for x ≤ -1/4, g(x) = -x -1/4, which has a slope of -1.

Wait, maybe I should tabulate:

x | |x| | |x| -1/4| ||x| -1/4|
---|----|--------|----------
0 | 0  | -1/4   | 1/4
1/4 |1/4 |0       |0
1/2 |1/2 |1/4     |1/4
-1/4 |1/4 |0       |0
-1/2 |1/2 |1/4     |1/4

So g(x) has minima at x=±1/4 (both g(x)=0), and at x=0, x=±1/2, etc., g(x)=1/4. So it's a diamond shape as well, but narrower.

So f(x) and g(x) are both absolute value functions with two layers of absolute values, creating diamond-shaped graphs with minima at different points.

Now, the functions we're given are:

y = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))

and

x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))

So we're dealing with compositions of these functions. Let's try to figure out what these compositions look like.

First, let's look at f(sin(2πx)). Let's consider how sin(2πx) behaves. The function sin(2πx) has a period of 1, oscillating between -1 and 1. So for any x, sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1. Then f is applied to that.

Since f is defined for all real numbers, but sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, so f(sin(2πx)) will be the same as f applied to a value between -1 and 1. From earlier, we saw that f(x) has minima at x=±1/2. So let's see what f(sin(2πx)) looks like.

Similarly, since sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, f(sin(2πx)) will have its minima whenever |sin(2πx)| = 1/2, because f(x) has minima at x=±1/2.

So f(sin(2πx)) = || sin(2πx)
