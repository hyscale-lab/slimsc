      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that's less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi ABCD. The rhombus is formed by points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, let me recall that a rhombus has diagonals that bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Because the properties say that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. Yeah, that's right. So, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, then B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal.\n\nGiven that, let me denote the coordinates of the points. Let\u2019s assume that the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin. So, points A and C are symmetric with respect to the origin, as are points B and D.\n\nSo, if point A is (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (u, v), then point D is (-u, -v).\n\nNow, since all four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, their coordinates must satisfy this equation.\n\nSo, for point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, for point B: u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. That is, the lengths of AB, BC, CD, and DA are equal.\n\nBut since the diagonals are perpendicular, the rhombus can also be characterized by the lengths of its diagonals. Let me think about the relationship between the diagonals and the sides.\n\nIn a rhombus, the area is (d1 * d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. Also, the area can be expressed as side squared times sine of one of the angles, but maybe that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, using vectors, perhaps. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me denote vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. Then, since A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal, the vectors OA and OB are position vectors of A and B respectively.\n\nBut since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors OA and OB must be perpendicular. Because in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, yes. So, vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. But since AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y), and BD is from B to D, which is (-2u, -2v). But the direction vectors of the diagonals would be AC and BD. But for the diagonals to be perpendicular, their direction vectors must be perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD should have a dot product of zero.\n\nWait, but AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from B to D, which is (-2u, -2v). So, their dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, (-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 0 => 4xu + 4yv = 0 => xu + yv = 0.\n\nSo, xu + yv = 0. That's a condition.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors OA and OB are perpendicular. Wait, no, because OA and OB are just vectors from the origin to A and B, but the diagonals are AC and BD, which are vectors from A to C and B to D. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the slopes of the diagonals. If diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular, then the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nThe slope of AC is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x.\n\nSimilarly, the slope of BD is (v - (-v))/(u - (-u)) = (2v)/(2u) = v/u.\n\nSo, the product of the slopes is (y/x)(v/u) = (yv)/(xu). Since they are perpendicular, this product is -1.\n\nSo, (yv)/(xu) = -1 => yv = -xu.\n\nWhich is the same as xu + yv = 0. So that's consistent.\n\nSo, that gives me a condition that xu + yv = 0.\n\nAdditionally, all four points lie on the hyperbola. So, for points A(x, y) and B(u, v), we have:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nu\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, now, I need to find BD\u00b2. Let's see, BD is the distance between points B and D. Since D is (-u, -v), then BD is the distance between (u, v) and (-u, -v).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (u - (-u))\u00b2 + (v - (-v))\u00b2 = (2u)\u00b2 + (2v)\u00b2 = 4u\u00b2 + 4v\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). So, I need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2, but wait, the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the infimum of BD\u00b2, the smallest possible upper bound for BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me read the question again: \"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that number is the supremum of the lower bounds for BD\u00b2. That is, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because it's the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, which would be the minimal value that BD\u00b2 can take, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, if BD\u00b2 can be as small as possible, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be that minimal BD\u00b2. But maybe BD\u00b2 has a lower bound, and we need to find the supremum of the lower bounds. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the infimum.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that for all such rhombi, BD\u00b2 is always greater than some number, and we need the greatest such number. So, that's the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi, meaning the minimal BD\u00b2 possible.\n\nSo, our goal is to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, which is 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2), given the constraints:\n\n1. xu + yv = 0,\n\n2. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\n3. u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have four variables x, y, u, v, and three equations. But since the points are on the hyperbola, we can perhaps express u and v in terms of x and y, or find a relationship between u and v.\n\nWait, from xu + yv = 0, we can express u in terms of v, or vice versa. Let's solve for u:\n\nxu = -yv => u = (-yv)/x.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to express v in terms of u: v = (-xu)/y.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of u and v as variables independent of x and y, but linked by xu + yv = 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola.\n\nHmm, hyperbola parametrization. For hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a standard parametrization is (a sec \u03b8, b tan \u03b8). So, maybe we can parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola using angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 or something.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me denote point A as (a sec \u03b8, b tan \u03b8), where a\u00b2 = 20, so a = 2\u221a5, and b\u00b2 = 24, so b = 2\u221a6. So, point A is (2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan \u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, point B can be parametrized as (2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan \u03c6).\n\nNow, since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, the condition xu + yv = 0 applies.\n\nSo, let's compute xu + yv.\n\nx = 2\u221a5 sec \u03b8,\n\nu = 2\u221a5 sec \u03c6,\n\ny = 2\u221a6 tan \u03b8,\n\nv = 2\u221a6 tan \u03c6.\n\nSo, xu + yv = (2\u221a5 sec \u03b8)(2\u221a5 sec \u03c6) + (2\u221a6 tan \u03b8)(2\u221a6 tan \u03c6).\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (4*5 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6) + (4*6 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6)\n\n= 20 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 + 24 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6.\n\nAnd this must equal zero.\n\nSo, 20 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 + 24 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6 = 0.\n\nLet me write this equation:\n\n20 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 + 24 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6 = 0.\n\nLet me divide both sides by sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6:\n\n20 + 24 (tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6)/(sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6) = 0.\n\nNote that tan \u03b8 = sin \u03b8 / cos \u03b8,\n\nand sec \u03b8 = 1 / cos \u03b8.\n\nSo, (tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6)/(sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6) = (sin \u03b8 / cos \u03b8)(sin \u03c6 / cos \u03c6) / (1/(cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6)) = (sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6)/(cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6) * cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6 = sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n20 + 24 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = 0.\n\nSo, 24 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -20.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n6 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5.\n\nSo, sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, that's one equation.\n\nNow, we also have BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nCompute u\u00b2 + v\u00b2.\n\nu = 2\u221a5 sec \u03c6,\n\nv = 2\u221a6 tan \u03c6.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = (2\u221a5 sec \u03c6)^2 + (2\u221a6 tan \u03c6)^2\n\n= 4*5 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 4*6 tan\u00b2 \u03c6\n\n= 20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6).\n\nWait, no: BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2) = 4*(20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6).\n\nWait, but hold on, u and v are for point B, which is (u, v) = (2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan \u03c6). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nBut perhaps I can express this in terms of sin and cos.\n\nExpress sec\u00b2 \u03c6 as 1 + tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = 20(1 + tan\u00b2 \u03c6) + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6 = 20 + 44 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(20 + 44 tan\u00b2 \u03c6) = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nHmm, so BD\u00b2 is 80 + 176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nBut we have a condition on sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWait, but I also need to relate \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can express tan \u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the condition sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6 and find the possible values of tan \u03c6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express tan \u03c6 in terms of sin \u03c6, and then find in terms of sin \u03b8.\n\nHmm, this might get complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of parametrizing both points, I can consider that the product sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 is fixed, and then find the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but BD\u00b2 is expressed in terms of \u03c6, so perhaps I can find the minimal BD\u00b2 given that sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut \u03b8 and \u03c6 are related through this equation, so perhaps I can express \u03b8 in terms of \u03c6, or vice versa.\n\nWait, let's consider that sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, sin \u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin \u03c6).\n\nBut since sin \u03b8 must be between -1 and 1, we have:\n\n| (-5)/(6 sin \u03c6) | \u2264 1 => |5/(6 sin \u03c6)| \u2264 1 => |sin \u03c6| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, |sin \u03c6| \u2265 5/6, which implies that \u03c6 is in the range where sin \u03c6 is at least 5/6 or at most -5/6.\n\nSo, sin \u03c6 \u2265 5/6 or sin \u03c6 \u2264 -5/6.\n\nSimilarly, sin \u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin \u03c6). So, if sin \u03c6 is positive, then sin \u03b8 is negative, and vice versa.\n\nBut how does this help me find BD\u00b2?\n\nWait, BD\u00b2 is expressed as 80 + 176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, to minimize BD\u00b2, I need to minimize tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nBut tan \u03c6 = sin \u03c6 / cos \u03c6.\n\nGiven that |sin \u03c6| \u2265 5/6, let me denote |sin \u03c6| = s, where s \u2265 5/6.\n\nThen, cos\u00b2 \u03c6 = 1 - s\u00b2.\n\nSo, tan\u00b2 \u03c6 = (s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176*(s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176*(s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2).\n\nNow, since s \u2265 5/6, let's let s = 5/6 + t, where t \u2265 0.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to consider s as a variable between 5/6 and 1, because sin \u03c6 can't be more than 1.\n\nSo, let's define s in [5/6, 1).\n\nThen, tan\u00b2 \u03c6 = s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176*(s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2).\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2 as s varies in [5/6, 1).\n\nSo, to find the minimal BD\u00b2, we can consider the function f(s) = 80 + 176*(s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2) for s \u2208 [5/6, 1).\n\nWe need to find the minimum of f(s) on this interval.\n\nTo find the minimum, let's compute the derivative of f(s) with respect to s and set it to zero.\n\nFirst, compute f'(s):\n\nf(s) = 80 + 176*(s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2).\n\nLet me write f(s) = 80 + 176 * s\u00b2 * (1 - s\u00b2)^(-1).\n\nThen, f'(s) = 176 * [ 2s*(1 - s\u00b2)^(-1) + s\u00b2 * 2s*(1 - s\u00b2)^(-2) ) ]\n\nWait, using the product rule:\n\nf'(s) = 176 * [ d/ds (s\u00b2) * (1 - s\u00b2)^(-1) + s\u00b2 * d/ds ( (1 - s\u00b2)^(-1) ) ]\n\nCompute each part:\n\nd/ds (s\u00b2) = 2s,\n\nd/ds ( (1 - s\u00b2)^(-1) ) = 2s*(1 - s\u00b2)^(-2).\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nf'(s) = 176 * [ 2s*(1 - s\u00b2)^(-1) + s\u00b2 * 2s*(1 - s\u00b2)^(-2) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 176 * [ 2s/(1 - s\u00b2) + 2s\u00b3/(1 - s\u00b2)^2 ]\n\nFactor out 2s/(1 - s\u00b2)^2:\n\n= 176 * [ 2s/(1 - s\u00b2) ) * ( (1 - s\u00b2) + s\u00b2 ) / (1 - s\u00b2) ) ]\n\nWait, perhaps another approach.\n\nLet me factor 2s/(1 - s\u00b2)^2:\n\n= 176 * [ 2s/(1 - s\u00b2) * (1 - s\u00b2 + s\u00b2) ) / (1 - s\u00b2) ]\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me compute numerator:\n\n= 2s/(1 - s\u00b2) + 2s\u00b3/(1 - s\u00b2)^2\n\n= [ 2s(1 - s\u00b2) + 2s\u00b3 ] / (1 - s\u00b2)^2\n\n= [ 2s - 2s\u00b3 + 2s\u00b3 ] / (1 - s\u00b2)^2\n\n= 2s / (1 - s\u00b2)^2\n\nSo, f'(s) = 176 * (2s)/(1 - s\u00b2)^2.\n\nSet derivative equal to zero:\n\n176 * (2s)/(1 - s\u00b2)^2 = 0.\n\nWhich implies 2s = 0 => s = 0.\n\nBut s is in [5/6, 1), so s=0 is not in the interval. Therefore, the function f(s) has no critical points in (5/6, 1). Thus, the minimum occurs at the left endpoint, s = 5/6.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is f(5/6).\n\nCompute f(5/6):\n\nf(5/6) = 80 + 176*( (25/36) ) / (1 - 25/36 )\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n1 - 25/36 = 11/36.\n\nSo, (25/36) / (11/36) = 25/11.\n\nThus, f(5/6) = 80 + 176*(25/11).\n\nCompute 176*(25/11):\n\n176 / 11 = 16, so 16*25 = 400.\n\nSo, f(5/6) = 80 + 400 = 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is minimized at 480.\n\nBut wait, the question is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Because BD\u00b2 is always at least 480, so the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nWait, but 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because 480 is the infimum.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify that. If BD\u00b2 can be 480 and larger, then the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because for any number larger than 480, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is 480, which is less than that number. So, 480 is the infimum, and hence the greatest lower bound.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that's less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi ABCD. The rhombus is formed by points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, let me recall that a rhombus has diagonals that bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Because the properties say that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. Yeah, that's right. So, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, then B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal.\n\nGiven that, let me denote the coordinates of the points. Let\u2019s assume that the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin. So, points A and C are symmetric with respect to the origin, as are points B and D.\n\nSo, if point A is (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (u, v), then point D is (-u, -v).\n\nNow, since all four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, their coordinates must satisfy this equation.\n\nSo, for point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, for point B: u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. That is, the lengths of AB, BC, CD, and DA are equal.\n\nBut since the diagonals are perpendicular, the rhombus can also be characterized by the lengths of its diagonals. Let me think about the relationship between the diagonals and the sides.\n\nIn a rhombus, the area is (d1 * d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. Also, the area can be expressed as side squared times sine of one of the angles, but maybe that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, using vectors, perhaps. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me denote vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. Then, since A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal, the vectors OA and OB are position vectors of A and B respectively.\n\nBut since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors OA and OB must be perpendicular. Because in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, yes. So, vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. But since AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y), and BD is from B to D, which is (-2u, -2v). But the direction vectors of the diagonals would be AC and BD. But for the diagonals to be perpendicular, their direction vectors must be perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD should have a dot product of zero.\n\nWait, but AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from B to D, which is (-2u, -2v). So, their dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, (-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 0 => 4xu + 4yv = 0 => xu + yv = 0.\n\nSo, xu + yv = 0. That's a condition.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors OA and OB are perpendicular. Wait, no, because OA and OB are just vectors from the origin to A and B, but the diagonals are AC and BD, which are vectors from A to C and B to D. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the slopes of the diagonals. If diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular, then the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nThe slope of AC is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x.\n\nSimilarly, the slope of BD is (v - (-v))/(u - (-u)) = (2v)/(2u) = v/u.\n\nSo, the product of the slopes is (y/x)(v/u) = (yv)/(xu). Since they are perpendicular, this product is -1.\n\nSo, (yv)/(xu) = -1 => yv = -xu.\n\nWhich is the same as xu + yv = 0. So that's consistent.\n\nSo, that gives me a condition that xu + yv = 0.\n\nAdditionally, all four points lie on the hyperbola. So, for points A(x, y) and B(u, v), we have:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nu\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, now, I need to find BD\u00b2. Let's see, BD is the distance between points B and D. Since D is (-u, -v), then BD is the distance between (u, v) and (-u, -v).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (u - (-u))\u00b2 + (v - (-v))\u00b2 = (2u)\u00b2 + (2v)\u00b2 = 4u\u00b2 + 4v\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). So, I need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2, but wait, the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the infimum of BD\u00b2, the smallest possible upper bound for BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me read the question again: \"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that number is the supremum of the lower bounds for BD\u00b2. That is, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because it's the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, which would be the minimal value that BD\u00b2 can take, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, if BD\u00b2 can be as small as possible, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be that minimal BD\u00b2. But maybe BD\u00b2 has a lower bound, and we need to find the supremum of the lower bounds. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the infimum.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that for all such rhombi, BD\u00b2 is always greater than some number, and we need the greatest such number. So, that's the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi, meaning the minimal BD\u00b2 possible.\n\nSo, our goal is to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, which is 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2), given the constraints:\n\n1. xu + yv = 0,\n\n2. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\n3. u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have four variables x, y, u, v, and three equations. But since the points are on the hyperbola, we can perhaps express u and v in terms of x and y, or find a relationship between u and v.\n\nWait, from xu + yv = 0, we can express u in terms of v, or vice versa. Let's solve for u:\n\nxu = -yv => u = (-yv)/x.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to express v in terms of u: v = (-xu)/y.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of u and v as variables independent of x and y, but linked by xu + yv = 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola.\n\nHmm, hyperbola parametrization. For hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a standard parametrization is (a sec \u03b8, b tan \u03b8). So, maybe we can parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola using angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 or something.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me denote point A as (a sec \u03b8, b tan \u03b8), where a\u00b2 = 20, so a = 2\u221a5, and b\u00b2 = 24, so b = 2\u221a6. So, point A is (2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan \u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, point B can be parametrized as (2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan \u03c6).\n\nNow, since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, the condition xu + yv = 0 applies.\n\nSo, let's compute xu + yv.\n\nx = 2\u221a5 sec \u03b8,\n\nu = 2\u221a5 sec \u03c6,\n\ny = 2\u221a6 tan \u03b8,\n\nv = 2\u221a6 tan \u03c6.\n\nSo, xu + yv = (2\u221a5 sec \u03b8)(2\u221a5 sec \u03c6) + (2\u221a6 tan \u03b8)(2\u221a6 tan \u03c6).\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (4*5 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6) + (4*6 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6)\n\n= 20 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 + 24 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6.\n\nAnd this must equal zero.\n\nSo, 20 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 + 24 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6 = 0.\n\nLet me write this equation:\n\n20 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 + 24 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6 = 0.\n\nLet me divide both sides by sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6:\n\n20 + 24 (tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6)/(sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6) = 0.\n\nNote that tan \u03b8 = sin \u03b8 / cos \u03b8,\n\nand sec \u03b8 = 1 / cos \u03b8.\n\nSo, (tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6)/(sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6) = (sin \u03b8 / cos \u03b8)(sin \u03c6 / cos \u03c6) / (1/(cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6)) = (sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6)/(cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6) * cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6 = sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n20 + 24 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = 0.\n\nSo, 24 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -20.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n6 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5.\n\nSo, sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, that's one equation.\n\nNow, we also have BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nCompute u\u00b2 + v\u00b2.\n\nu = 2\u221a5 sec \u03c6,\n\nv = 2\u221a6 tan \u03c6.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = (2\u221a5 sec \u03c6)^2 + (2\u221a6 tan \u03c6)^2\n\n= 4*5 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 4*6 tan\u00b2 \u03c6\n\n= 20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6).\n\nWait, no: BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2) = 4*(20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6).\n\nWait, but hold on, u and v are for point B, which is (u, v) = (2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan \u03c6). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nBut perhaps I can express this in terms of sin and cos.\n\nExpress sec\u00b2 \u03c6 as 1 + tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = 20(1 + tan\u00b2 \u03c6) + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6 = 20 + 44 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(20 + 44 tan\u00b2 \u03c6) = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nHmm, so BD\u00b2 is 80 + 176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nBut we have a condition on sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWait, but I also need to relate \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can express tan \u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the condition sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6 and find the possible values of tan \u03c6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express tan \u03c6 in terms of sin \u03c6, and then find in terms of sin \u03b8.\n\nHmm, this might get complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of parametrizing both points, I can consider that the product sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 is fixed, and then find the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but BD\u00b2 is expressed in terms of \u03c6, so perhaps I can find the minimal BD\u00b2 given that sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut \u03b8 and \u03c6 are related through this equation, so perhaps I can express \u03b8 in terms of \u03c6, or vice versa.\n\nWait, let's consider that sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, sin \u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin \u03c6).\n\nBut since sin \u03b8 must be between -1 and 1, we have:\n\n| (-5)/(6 sin \u03c6) | \u2264 1 => |5/(6 sin \u03c6)| \u2264 1 => |sin \u03c6| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, |sin \u03c6| \u2265 5/6, which implies that \u03c6 is in the range where sin \u03c6 is at least 5/6 or at most -5/6.\n\nSo, sin \u03c6 \u2265 5/6 or sin \u03c6 \u2264 -5/6.\n\nSimilarly, sin \u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin \u03c6). So, if sin \u03c6 is positive, then sin \u03b8 is negative, and vice versa.\n\nBut how does this help me find BD\u00b2?\n\nWait, BD\u00b2 is expressed as 80 + 176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, to minimize BD\u00b2, I need to minimize tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nBut tan \u03c6 = sin \u03c6 / cos \u03c6.\n\nGiven that |sin \u03c6| \u2265 5/6, let me denote |sin \u03c6| = s, where s \u2265 5/6.\n\nThen, cos\u00b2 \u03c6 = 1 - s\u00b2.\n\nSo, tan\u00b2 \u03c6 = (s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176*(s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176*(s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2).\n\nNow, since s \u2265 5/6, let's let s = 5/6 + t, where t \u2265 0.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to consider s as a variable between 5/6 and 1, because sin \u03c6 can't be more than 1.\n\nSo, let's define s in [5/6, 1).\n\nThen, tan\u00b2 \u03c6 = s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176*(s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2).\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2 as s varies in [5/6, 1).\n\nSo, to find the minimal BD\u00b2, we can consider the function f(s) = 80 + 176*(s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2) for s \u2208 [5/6, 1).\n\nWe need to find the minimum of f(s) on this interval.\n\nTo find the minimum, let's compute the derivative of f(s) with respect to s and set it to zero.\n\nFirst, compute f'(s):\n\nf(s) = 80 + 176*(s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2).\n\nLet me write f(s) = 80 + 176 * s\u00b2 * (1 - s\u00b2)^(-1).\n\nThen, f'(s) = 176 * [ 2s*(1 - s\u00b2)^(-1) + s\u00b2 * 2s*(1 - s\u00b2)^(-2) ) ]\n\nWait, using the product rule:\n\nf'(s) = 176 * [ d/ds (s\u00b2) * (1 - s\u00b2)^(-1) + s\u00b2 * d/ds ( (1 - s\u00b2)^(-1) ) ]\n\nCompute each part:\n\nd/ds (s\u00b2) = 2s,\n\nd/ds ( (1 - s\u00b2)^(-1) ) = 2s*(1 - s\u00b2)^(-2).\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nf'(s) = 176 * [ 2s*(1 - s\u00b2)^(-1) + s\u00b2 * 2s*(1 - s\u00b2)^(-2) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 176 * [ 2s/(1 - s\u00b2) + 2s\u00b3/(1 - s\u00b2)^2 ]\n\nFactor out 2s/(1 - s\u00b2)^2:\n\n= 176 * [ 2s/(1 - s\u00b2) ) * ( (1 - s\u00b2) + s\u00b2 ) / (1 - s\u00b2) ) ]\n\nWait, perhaps another approach.\n\nLet me factor 2s/(1 - s\u00b2)^2:\n\n= 176 * [ 2s/(1 - s\u00b2) * (1 - s\u00b2 + s\u00b2) ) / (1 - s\u00b2) ]\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me compute numerator:\n\n= 2s/(1 - s\u00b2) + 2s\u00b3/(1 - s\u00b2)^2\n\n= [ 2s(1 - s\u00b2) + 2s\u00b3 ] / (1 - s\u00b2)^2\n\n= [ 2s - 2s\u00b3 + 2s\u00b3 ] / (1 - s\u00b2)^2\n\n= 2s / (1 - s\u00b2)^2\n\nSo, f'(s) = 176 * (2s)/(1 - s\u00b2)^2.\n\nSet derivative equal to zero:\n\n176 * (2s)/(1 - s\u00b2)^2 = 0.\n\nWhich implies 2s = 0 => s = 0.\n\nBut s is in [5/6, 1), so s=0 is not in the interval. Therefore, the function f(s) has no critical points in (5/6, 1). Thus, the minimum occurs at the left endpoint, s = 5/6.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is f(5/6).\n\nCompute f(5/6):\n\nf(5/6) = 80 + 176*( (25/36) ) / (1 - 25/36 )\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n1 - 25/36 = 11/36.\n\nSo, (25/36) / (11/36) = 25/11.\n\nThus, f(5/6) = 80 + 176*(25/11).\n\nCompute 176*(25/11):\n\n176 / 11 = 16, so 16*25 = 400.\n\nSo, f(5/6) = 80 + 400 = 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is minimized at 480.\n\nBut wait, the question is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Because BD\u00b2 is always at least 480, so the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nWait, but 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because 480 is the infimum.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify that. If BD\u00b2 can be 480 and larger, then the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because for any number larger than 480, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is 480, which is less than that number. So, 480 is the infimum, and hence the greatest lower bound.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we consider a rhombus \\(ABCD\\) inscribed in the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular, and their midpoints are at the origin. \n\nLet points \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) be \\((x, y)\\) and \\((-x, -y)\\), and points \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) be \\((u, v)\\) and \\((-u, -v)\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on a hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. No, wait, actually, yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Right, because a rhombus is a type of kite, and in a kite, one diagonal is the perpendicular bisector of the other. But in a rhombus, both diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So, yes, the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, since the hyperbola is centered at (0,0). So the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.\n\nSo, in the hyperbola equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, the transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x\u00b2. The transverse axis length is 2a, where a\u00b2=20, so a=2\u221a5. The conjugate axis length is 2b, where b\u00b2=24, so b=2\u221a6.\n\nNow, the points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Let me think about the properties of such a rhombus.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so if the origin is the intersection point, then each vertex is symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if A is a point (x, y), then the point opposite to A, which would be C, is (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (u, v), then D is (-u, -v).\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily the axes of the hyperbola. So, perhaps the diagonals are not aligned with the coordinate axes. Hmm, but the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes, so maybe the diagonals can be at any angle, but they must pass through the origin.\n\nBut how does this affect the coordinates of the points A, B, C, D?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the diagonals are along the coordinate axes? Because the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes, so it's possible that the diagonals of the rhombus lie along the x-axis and y-axis.\n\nWait, if the diagonals are along the axes, then points A, B, C, D would be at (p, 0), (0, q), (-p, 0), (0, -q), but that would form a kite, but not necessarily a rhombus unless p = q, but then it would be a square. But in that case, the points would lie on the hyperbola, but let's check.\n\nWait, but if points are at (p,0), (0,q), (-p,0), (0,-q), then all four points must lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo plugging (p,0) into the hyperbola equation: p\u00b2/20 - 0 =1 => p\u00b2=20 => p=\u00b1\u221a20=\u00b12\u221a5.\n\nSimilarly, plugging (0,q): 0 - q\u00b2/24=1 => q\u00b2= -24, which is impossible. So, that can't be.\n\nSo, the points can't be on the axes except for the vertices of the hyperbola, but the hyperbola doesn't have points on the y-axis. So, perhaps the diagonals aren't along the coordinate axes.\n\nTherefore, the rhombus is such that its diagonals are not aligned with the axes but still pass through the origin.\n\nSo, for a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so if one diagonal is along some line through the origin, the other is along a perpendicular line through the origin.\n\nLet me parameterize the points. Let's say that one diagonal is BD, and the other is AC.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, the diagonals are along two perpendicular lines through the origin. Let's say that one diagonal is along a line making an angle \u03b8 with the x-axis, and the other is along \u03b8 + 90 degrees.\n\nLet me denote the endpoints of diagonal BD as points B and D, and endpoints of diagonal AC as points A and C.\n\nSince the origin is the midpoint, points B and D are symmetric with respect to the origin, same with A and C.\n\nSo, if point B is (x, y), then D is (-x, -y). Similarly, point A is (u, v), so point C is (-u, -v).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nBut since the diagonals are perpendicular, the sides can be calculated in terms of the diagonals.\n\nWait, another approach: in a rhombus, the area is (d1*d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. Also, all sides can be expressed in terms of the diagonals.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to use coordinates.\n\nGiven that points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nAlso, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other at the origin.\n\nSo, points A and C are on one diagonal, points B and D on the other.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nLet me assume that diagonal AC has slope m, and diagonal BD has slope -1/m.\n\nBut wait, since the diagonals are lines through the origin, if one has slope m, the other has slope -1/m.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to use parametric equations for the diagonals.\n\nLet me consider diagonal AC lying along a line with angle \u03b8 from the x-axis, so points A and C can be represented as (t cos\u03b8, t sin\u03b8) and (-t cos\u03b8, -t sin\u03b8), where t is the length from the origin to A.\n\nSimilarly, diagonal BD lies along a line perpendicular to AC, so with angle \u03b8 + 90 degrees, so points B and D can be represented as (s sin\u03b8, -s cos\u03b8) and (-s sin\u03b8, s cos\u03b8), where s is the length from the origin to B.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write the parametric points more carefully.\n\nWait, if diagonal AC is along a line making angle \u03b8 with the x-axis, then points A and C can be represented as (a cos\u03b8, a sin\u03b8) and (-a cos\u03b8, -a sin\u03b8), where a is the distance from the origin to A (and similarly to C).\n\nSimilarly, diagonal BD is perpendicular to AC, so it makes angle \u03b8 + 90 degrees with the x-axis. So, points B and D can be represented as (b sin\u03b8, -b cos\u03b8) and (-b sin\u03b8, b cos\u03b8), where b is the distance from the origin to B (and D).\n\nWait, let me confirm the direction. The direction of BD should be perpendicular to AC. So, if AC is in direction (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8), then BD is in direction (-sin\u03b8, cos\u03b8), which is a 90-degree rotation.\n\nSo, points B and D would be (b*(-sin\u03b8), b*cos\u03b8) and (-b*(-sin\u03b8), -b*cos\u03b8) = (b sin\u03b8, -b cos\u03b8). Wait, perhaps I should write it as (b sin\u03b8, -b cos\u03b8) and (-b sin\u03b8, b cos\u03b8). So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, points:\n\nA: (a cos\u03b8, a sin\u03b8)\n\nC: (-a cos\u03b8, -a sin\u03b8)\n\nB: (b sin\u03b8, -b cos\u03b8)\n\nD: (-b sin\u03b8, b cos\u03b8)\n\nNow, all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo, substituting point A into the hyperbola equation:\n\n(a cos\u03b8)^2 /20 - (a sin\u03b8)^2 /24 = 1\n\nSimilarly, substituting point B:\n\n(b sin\u03b8)^2 /20 - (-b cos\u03b8)^2 /24 =1\n\nLet me write these equations:\n\nFor point A:\n(a\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (a\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24 =1\n\nFactor out a\u00b2:\na\u00b2 [ (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ] =1\n\nSimilarly, for point B:\n(b\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (b\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 =1\n\nFactor out b\u00b2:\nb\u00b2 [ (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ] =1\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1. a\u00b2 [ (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ] =1\n\n2. b\u00b2 [ (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ] =1\n\nLet me denote equation 1 as:\n\na\u00b2 [ (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ] =1\n\nEquation 2:\n\nb\u00b2 [ (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ] =1\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me write them more neatly.\n\nLet me compute the coefficients:\n\nCoefficient for a\u00b2:\n\ncos\u00b2\u03b8 /20 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 /24 = [ (6 cos\u00b2\u03b8 -5 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] / 120\n\nSimilarly, coefficient for b\u00b2:\n\nsin\u00b2\u03b8 /20 - cos\u00b2\u03b8 /24 = [ (6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -5 cos\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] / 120\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes:\n\na\u00b2 * (6 cos\u00b2\u03b8 -5 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) /120 =1\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 = 120 / (6 cos\u00b2\u03b8 -5 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nSimilarly, equation 2:\n\nb\u00b2 * (6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -5 cos\u00b2\u03b8 ) /120 =1\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 = 120 / (6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -5 cos\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nHmm, interesting. So, a\u00b2 and b\u00b2 are expressed in terms of \u03b8.\n\nNow, in the rhombus, the sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, etc. But since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, so AB = BC.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the sides can be found using the Pythagorean theorem with half the diagonals.\n\nWait, in a rhombus, each side can be calculated as (1/2) * sqrt(d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2). Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the length of each side is (1/2) * sqrt(d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2). Because the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, so each side is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs d1/2 and d2/2.\n\nWait, no, actually, each side is equal to sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 ). So, the side length s is sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 ) = (1/2) * sqrt(d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2).\n\nSo, in this case, the diagonals are AC and BD. The length of AC is 2a, and the length of BD is 2b. So, the side length is (1/2)*sqrt( (2a)^2 + (2b)^2 ) = (1/2)*sqrt(4a\u00b2 +4b\u00b2) )= (1/2)*2*sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2) = sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2).\n\nBut wait, in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, etc. So, let me compute AB.\n\nPoint A is (a cos\u03b8, a sin\u03b8)\n\nPoint B is (b sin\u03b8, -b cos\u03b8)\n\nSo, the distance AB is sqrt[ (a cos\u03b8 - b sin\u03b8)^2 + (a sin\u03b8 + b cos\u03b8)^2 ]\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n= sqrt[ (a cos\u03b8 - b sin\u03b8)^2 + (a sin\u03b8 + b cos\u03b8)^2 ]\n\nExpanding both squares:\n\n= sqrt[ a\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8 - 2ab cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 + b\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + a\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 2ab sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + b\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8 ]\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n-2ab cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 and +2ab sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 cancel out.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n= sqrt[ a\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8 + a\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + b\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + b\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8 ]\n\nFactor terms:\n\n= sqrt[ a\u00b2 (cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8) + b\u00b2 (sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8) ]\n\nSince cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1, this simplifies to:\n\n= sqrt[ a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ]\n\nSo, AB = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, since all sides are equal, that's consistent with the earlier result.\n\nSo, AB = sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 )\n\nBut since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, so that's correct.\n\nBut how does this help me? Maybe I need another condition.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the fact that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Which we already have, since we constructed them that way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a relationship between a and b.\n\nWait, another approach: since points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nWe already have expressions for a\u00b2 and b\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nSo, from earlier:\n\na\u00b2 = 120 / (6 cos\u00b2\u03b8 -5 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nb\u00b2 = 120 / (6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -5 cos\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nWait, but for the denominators to be positive, because a\u00b2 and b\u00b2 must be positive.\n\nSo, 6 cos\u00b2\u03b8 -5 sin\u00b2\u03b8 >0 and 6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -5 cos\u00b2\u03b8 >0.\n\nHmm, let's see:\n\nFirst inequality: 6 cos\u00b2\u03b8 -5 sin\u00b2\u03b8 >0\n\nWhich is equivalent to 6 cos\u00b2\u03b8 >5 sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nDividing both sides by cos\u00b2\u03b8 (assuming cos\u03b8 \u22600):\n\n6 >5 tan\u00b2\u03b8\n\nSo, tan\u00b2\u03b8 < 6/5 => |tan\u03b8| < sqrt(6/5) \u2248 1.095.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -5 cos\u00b2\u03b8 >0\n\nWhich is equivalent to 6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 >5 cos\u00b2\u03b8\n\nDividing both sides by cos\u00b2\u03b8 (again, assuming cos\u03b8 \u22600):\n\n6 tan\u00b2\u03b8 >5\n\nSo, tan\u00b2\u03b8 >5/6 \u22480.833.\n\nSo, combining both inequalities:\n\n5/6 < tan\u00b2\u03b8 <6/5\n\nSo, tan\u03b8 must satisfy sqrt(5/6) < |tan\u03b8| < sqrt(6/5)\n\nWhich is approximately 0.9129 < |tan\u03b8| < 1.0954.\n\nSo, \u03b8 is in the range where tan\u03b8 is between approximately 0.9129 and 1.0954, or the negative counterparts.\n\nSo, \u03b8 is in an angle where the slope is between those values.\n\nSo, okay, now, so a\u00b2 and b\u00b2 are positive only when tan\u03b8 is in that range.\n\nSo, now, I need to find BD\u00b2.\n\nBD is the diagonal from B to D, which has length 2b, so BD\u00b2 is (2b)^2 =4b\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4b\u00b2 =4*(120)/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -5 cos\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nBut I can express this in terms of tan\u03b8.\n\nLet me set t = tan\u03b8.\n\nThen, sin\u00b2\u03b8 = t\u00b2/(1 + t\u00b2), cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1/(1 + t\u00b2)\n\nSo, substituting into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4*(120)/(6*(t\u00b2/(1 + t\u00b2)) -5*(1/(1 + t\u00b2)) )\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n= [6 t\u00b2 -5 ] / (1 + t\u00b2 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 =4*120*(1 + t\u00b2)/(6 t\u00b2 -5 )\n\n= 480*(1 + t\u00b2)/(6 t\u00b2 -5 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480*(1 + t\u00b2)/(6 t\u00b2 -5 )\n\nNow, we can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 =480*(1 + t\u00b2)/(6 t\u00b2 -5 )\n\nWe need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nIn other words, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible \u03b8 (i.e., t) where t\u00b2 is in (5/6,6/5).\n\nSo, t\u00b2 \u2208 (5/6, 6/5).\n\nLet me denote u = t\u00b2, so u \u2208 (5/6,6/5).\n\nThen, BD\u00b2 as a function of u is:\n\nBD\u00b2(u) =480*(1 + u)/(6u -5 )\n\nWe need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2(u) over u \u2208 (5/6,6/5). Because the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum of BD\u00b2 over u.\n\nSo, to find the minimum of BD\u00b2(u), let's compute the derivative of BD\u00b2 with respect to u and find critical points.\n\nLet me compute BD\u00b2(u):\n\nBD\u00b2(u) =480*(1 + u)/(6u -5 )\n\nLet me denote f(u) = (1 + u)/(6u -5 )\n\nThen, BD\u00b2(u) =480*f(u)\n\nCompute derivative f\u2019(u):\n\nUsing quotient rule: f\u2019(u) = [ (1)(6u -5) - (1 + u)(6) ] / (6u -5)^2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n= [6u -5 -6(1 + u) ] = 6u -5 -6 -6u = (6u -6u) + (-5 -6) = -11\n\nSo, f\u2019(u) = (-11)/(6u -5)^2\n\nSince denominator is positive for u >5/6, the derivative is negative. So, f(u) is decreasing on u \u2208 (5/6,6/5).\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2(u) is decreasing in u, so its minimum occurs at the maximum value of u, which is u=6/5.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, BD\u00b2(u) is proportional to f(u), which is decreasing. So, BD\u00b2(u) is also decreasing in u.\n\nWait, so as u increases, BD\u00b2 decreases.\n\nSo, the minimum value of BD\u00b2 occurs at u=6/5, and the maximum occurs at u=5/6.\n\nWait, but we are to find the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is the minimum value, which is at u=6/5.\n\nWait, let me think again. Since BD\u00b2(u) is decreasing in u, when u approaches 5/6 from the right, BD\u00b2(u) approaches 480*(1 +5/6)/(6*(5/6)-5 )= let's compute that.\n\nWait, no, wait, actually, when u approaches 5/6 from the right, 6u -5 approaches 6*(5/6) -5=5-5=0 from the positive side, so denominator approaches 0+, making BD\u00b2(u) approach infinity.\n\nSimilarly, when u approaches 6/5 from the left, 6u-5 approaches 6*(6/5) -5= 36/5 -25/5=11/5.\n\nWait, no, 6*(6/5)=36/5=7.2, minus 5 is 2.2=11/5.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(u) approaches 480*(1 +6/5)/(11/5 )=480*(11/5)/(11/5)=480.\n\nWait, wait, hold on. Let me compute BD\u00b2(u) at u=6/5.\n\nBD\u00b2(u)=480*(1 +6/5)/(6*(6/5)-5)=480*(11/5)/(36/5 -25/5)=480*(11/5)/(11/5)=480.\n\nSo, at u=6/5, BD\u00b2=480.\n\nSimilarly, at u approaching 5/6 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, the function BD\u00b2(u) decreases from infinity to 480 as u increases from 5/6 to 6/5.\n\nThus, the minimum value of BD\u00b2 is 480, and it can get arbitrarily large as u approaches 5/6.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nSo, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, meaning that BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480, and can get as close to 480 as desired, but not less than 480.\n\nWait, but wait, is BD\u00b2 always greater than 480? Because when u approaches 6/5, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut hold on, when u approaches 6/5, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above?\n\nWait, let's see, when u approaches 6/5, which is the upper limit of u, from below, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nWait, no, if u approaches 6/5 from below, then BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut at u=6/5, is BD\u00b2=480? Let me check.\n\nAt u=6/5,\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(1 +6/5)/(6*(6/5)-5 )=480*(11/5)/(36/5 -25/5)=480*(11/5)/(11/5)=480.\n\nYes, exactly 480.\n\nSo, as u approaches 6/5 from below, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nWait, no, because when u increases towards 6/5, BD\u00b2 decreases towards 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, but not lower.\n\nSo, for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, but can be larger.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 is always at least 480.\n\nWait, but the question is: \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is >=480. Therefore, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because for some rhombi, BD\u00b2 is exactly 480, so you can't have a number greater than 480 that is less than all BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but in the case when BD\u00b2 can be 480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would have to be less than or equal to 480. But if you take 480, then for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=480, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2, it's equal.\n\nSo, perhaps the infimum is 480, but BD\u00b2 can't be less than 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, but since BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, the number has to be less than 480.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, we need a number m such that for every rhombus, BD\u00b2 > m, and m is as large as possible.\n\nSo, m is the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, m would be 480.\n\nBut wait, if BD\u00b2 can be 480, then m cannot be 480 because m must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, then m can't be 480 because for that particular rhombus, BD\u00b2 is 480, so m must be less than 480.\n\nWait, but if the infimum is 480, meaning that BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480 from above, but not below, then 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nSo, the greatest real number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nBecause for any m' >480, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than m' (since BD\u00b2 can be as close to 480 as desired). But for m=480, there's no rhombus with BD\u00b2 less than 480. So, 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if 480 is the infimum, meaning that BD\u00b2 can be as close to 480 as desired but never less, then 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nBut since 480 is attainable (when u=6/5, BD\u00b2=480), then 480 is actually the minimum value.\n\nWait, but in that case, for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=480, m must be less than 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number m that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is just below 480.\n\nBut since we're dealing with real numbers, the supremum of such m is 480.\n\nBut the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, perhaps the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, then any number m less than or equal to 480 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi except the one where BD\u00b2=480.\n\nWait, but if m=480, then for that particular rhombus, m is equal to BD\u00b2, not less.\n\nSo, m must be strictly less than 480.\n\nBut the question is asking for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nSo, 480 is the infimum, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480.\n\nWait, but since 480 is attainable, perhaps the answer is 480.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about it.\n\nIf BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, then 480 is the minimum. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, so 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nBut the question says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be 480, then 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for that particular rhombus.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier reasoning. Let me see.\n\nIf BD\u00b2 can be 480, then 480 is the minimal possible BD\u00b2, so for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 >=480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is m=480, because BD\u00b2 can be 480, so m cannot be higher than 480, and for any m <480, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is just slightly above 480, so m is less than BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but no, because if m=480, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, m=480 is not less than BD\u00b2, it's equal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the infimum, which is 480, but since BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but 480 is not less than 480. So, the greatest real number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the supremum of all m where m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, m must be less than or equal to 480.\n\nBut since m has to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, including the one with BD\u00b2=480, m has to be less than 480.\n\nSo, the supremum of such m is 480, but m cannot reach 480.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, in other words, m is the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 480.\n\nBut since 480 is attainable, m must be less than 480.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, another approach: think of m as the infimum. The infimum is 480, so for any \u03b5>0, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 <480 + \u03b5. But since BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, m must be 480.\n\nWait, no. If BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, then m must be less than or equal to 480, but the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, m must be less than 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest such m is 480, because any m greater than 480 would fail for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480.\n\nWait, no, if m is greater than 480, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, m is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nBut if m is exactly 480, then for that rhombus, m=480 is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, the answer must be the infimum, which is 480, but since BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, m has to be less than 480.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nSo, the supremum of all m where m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nBut since m must be less than 480, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 480, as the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nBut the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but if 480 is attainable, then 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for that rhombus.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is 480.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recompute BD\u00b2 when u=6/5.\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(1 +6/5)/(6*(6/5)-5 )\n\n=480*(11/5)/(36/5 -25/5)\n\n=480*(11/5)/(11/5)\n\n=480*(11/5)*(5/11)=480.\n\nSo, yes, BD\u00b2=480 when u=6/5.\n\nSo, in that case, the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480 exists.\n\nTherefore, for that rhombus, BD\u00b2=480.\n\nSo, the greatest real number m that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi must be less than 480.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the greatest such m.\n\nSo, the supremum of all such m is 480, but m cannot reach 480.\n\nBut in terms of real numbers, the supremum is 480, but it's not attained.\n\nBut in the context of the problem, perhaps we can just write 480 as the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so the answer is 480.\n\nBut the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so it's the greatest lower bound.\n\nBut in the real numbers, the greatest lower bound is 480, but for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 >=480. So, 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nBut the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi,\" which would mean that m must be less than BD\u00b2 for every rhombus, including the one with BD\u00b2=480.\n\nTherefore, m must be less than 480.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest such m.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but 480 is not less than 480. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the closure, so 480 is the answer.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is 480.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the function.\n\nWait, let me check the function BD\u00b2(u)=480*(1 + u)/(6u -5 )\n\nWe have u \u2208 (5/6,6/5).\n\nAt u=6/5, BD\u00b2=480.\n\nAt u approaching 5/6 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is a continuous function on u \u2208 [5/6,6/5], but u cannot be exactly 5/6 because the denominator becomes zero.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(u) is decreasing on u \u2208 (5/6,6/5), from +infty to 480.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, and the maximum is unbounded.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nBecause for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 >=480, so 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2.\n\nBut the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=480, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the answer must be less than 480.\n\nBut how much less?\n\nWait, but the infimum is 480, so for any m <480, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 < m? No, that's not right.\n\nWait, no, because BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, so for any m <480, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 < m is false, because BD\u00b2 can be 480, which is greater than m.\n\nWait, no, if m is less than 480, then for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=480, m <480 < BD\u00b2.\n\nBut for other rhombuses, BD\u00b2 can be larger than 480, but since we need m to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, m must be less than or equal to the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, if m is less than 480, then for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=480, m <480 < BD\u00b2, so it's okay. But for the rhombus where BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above, m is less than BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, because BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, so if m is less than 480, then m is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi except the one where BD\u00b2=480, but since in that case, m <480 < BD\u00b2=480 is false.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 480.\n\nIn the problem statement, it's asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nSo, if BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, then 480 is the greatest lower bound, so the answer is 480.\n\nBut since 480 is attainable, then m=480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for that rhombus.\n\nThus, the answer must be 480.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is from an Olympiad, and the answer is 480.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me think about the hyperbola.\n\nGiven the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1.\n\nWe can parametrize points on the hyperbola as (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8), but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, points on hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions.\n\nLet me set x = sqrt(20) cosh t, y = sqrt(24) sinh t.\n\nBut perhaps that's complicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the coordinates of the rhombus in terms of vectors.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular and intersect at the origin, the vectors representing the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nLet me denote vector AC as vector a, and BD as vector b, with a \u00b7 b =0.\n\nSince all four points are on the hyperbola, so points A, B, C, D can be written as (a/2, b/2), (-a/2, b/2), (-a/2, -b/2), (a/2, -b/2), but wait, no, that would be if the diagonals are aligned with the axes.\n\nBut in this case, the diagonals are arbitrary.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, if the diagonals are vectors u and v, then the four vertices are (u + v)/2, (-u + v)/2, (-u -v)/2, (u -v)/2.\n\nWait, but in this case, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points are u, -u, v, -v.\n\nWait, no, if the diagonals are vectors u and v, then the four points would be (u + v)/2, (-u + v)/2, (-u -v)/2, (u -v)/2.\n\nBut if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then the midpoints are at the origin, so the four points are (u,0), (-u,0), (0,v), (0,-v) if the diagonals are along the axes, but in our case, the diagonals are not necessarily along the axes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the rhombus as a parallelogram with perpendicular diagonals.\n\nIn that case, the coordinates can be expressed as (p, q), (-p, -q), (r, s), (-r, -s), with p*r + q*s=0 (because the diagonals are perpendicular).\n\nBut all four points lie on the hyperbola.\n\nBut this seems more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombus with perpendicular diagonals intersecting at the origin, the coordinates of the vertices satisfy that the dot product of vectors OA and OB is zero, where O is the origin.\n\nWait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, but the sides are not necessarily perpendicular to the position vectors.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that if points A, B, C, D form a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, then vectors OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nWait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so vectors OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nWait, but OA and OB are the diagonals, so their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, if points A and B are (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), then vectors OA and OB are the diagonals, so OA \u00b7 OB =0.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are AC and BD, so vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.\n\nSo, if points A and C are (x1,y1) and (-x1,-y1), and points B and D are (x2,y2) and (-x2,-y2), then vectors AC = ( -2x1, -2y1 ), BD=( -2x2, -2y2 ).\n\nTheir dot product is ( -2x1)( -2x2 ) + ( -2y1 )( -2y2 )=4x1x2 +4y1y2=0.\n\nSo, x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nSo, the dot product of vectors OA and OB is zero.\n\nThus, points A and B must satisfy x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nSo, for points A(x1,y1) and B(x2,y2) on the hyperbola, x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nBut both points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nx1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24=1,\n\nx2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24=1,\n\nand x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express y2 in terms of x1, x2, y1.\n\nFrom x1x2 + y1y2=0 => y2= - (x1x2)/y1.\n\nSubstituting into the hyperbola equation for point B:\n\nx2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo,\n\nx2\u00b2/20 - [ (x1\u00b2x2\u00b2)/(y1\u00b2) ] /24=1.\n\nBut from point A's hyperbola equation:\n\nx1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24=1 => x1\u00b2/20 =1 + y1\u00b2/24 => x1\u00b2=20 + (20 y1\u00b2)/24=20 + (5 y1\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x1\u00b2=20 + (5 y1\u00b2)/6.\n\nSimilarly, x2\u00b2=20 + (5 y2\u00b2)/6.\n\nBut y2= -x1x2/y1, so y2\u00b2= (x1\u00b2x2\u00b2)/y1\u00b2.\n\nSo, substituting into x2\u00b2=20 + (5 y2\u00b2)/6,\n\nx2\u00b2=20 + (5/6)*(x1\u00b2x2\u00b2)/y1\u00b2.\n\nRearranging,\n\nx2\u00b2 -

(5 x1\u00b2)/(6 y1\u00b2)=1 - [20/(y1\u00b2) +5/6 ]=1 -5/6 -20/(y1\u00b2)=1/6 -20/(y1\u00b2).\n\nSo, going back,\n\nx2\u00b2 [1/6 -20/(y1\u00b2) ]=20.\n\nSo,\n\nx2\u00b2=20 / [1/6 -20/(y1\u00b2) ]=20 / [ (y1\u00b2 -120)/(6 y1\u00b2) ]=20 * (6 y1\u00b2)/(y1\u00b2 -120 )=120 y1\u00b2/(y1\u00b2 -120 ).\n\nSo,\n\nx2\u00b2=120 y1\u00b2/(y1\u00b2 -120 ).\n\nBut x2\u00b2 must be positive, so denominator must have the same sign as numerator.\n\nSince y1\u00b2>0, denominator y1\u00b2 -120 must be positive.\n\nSo,\n\ny1\u00b2 -120 >0 => y1\u00b2>120.\n\nSo, y1\u00b2>120.\n\nSo, now, we have expressions for x1\u00b2 and x2\u00b2 in terms of y1\u00b2.\n\nBut let's also remember that points A and B are vertices of the rhombus, so the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, but since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal.\n\nBut perhaps we can compute the side length.\n\nBut alternatively, perhaps I can express BD\u00b2 in terms of y1\u00b2.\n\nWait, point B is (x2, y2)= (x2, -x1x2/y1 ).\n\nSo, BD is the diagonal from B to D, which is from (x2, y2) to (-x2, -y2).\n\nSo, BD has length sqrt[ (2x2)^2 + (2y2)^2 ]=2 sqrt(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 ).\n\nThus, BD\u00b2=4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 ).\n\nBut y2= -x1x2/y1, so y2\u00b2= x1\u00b2x2\u00b2 / y1\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4(x2\u00b2 + x1\u00b2x2\u00b2 / y1\u00b2 )=4x2\u00b2(1 +x1\u00b2/y1\u00b2 ).\n\nFrom earlier, x2\u00b2=120 y1\u00b2/(y1\u00b2 -120 ).\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(120 y1\u00b2/(y1\u00b2 -120 ))*(1 +x1\u00b2/y1\u00b2 ).\n\nBut x1\u00b2=20 + (5 y1\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo,\n\nx1\u00b2/y1\u00b2= (20 + (5 y1\u00b2)/6 ) / y1\u00b2=20/y1\u00b2 +5/6.\n\nTherefore,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(120 y1\u00b2/(y1\u00b2 -120 ))*(1 +20/y1\u00b2 +5/6 )\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n1 +5/6=11/6.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(120 y1\u00b2/(y1\u00b2 -120 ))*(11/6 +20/y1\u00b2 )\n\n=4*(120 y1\u00b2/(y1\u00b2 -120 ))*( (11 y1\u00b2 +120 )/(6 y1\u00b2 ) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n=4*(120 y1\u00b2) * (11 y1\u00b2 +120 ) / [ (y1\u00b2 -120 ) *6 y1\u00b2 ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n=4*120*(11 y1\u00b2 +120 ) / [6(y1\u00b2 -120 ) ]\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n4*120=480,\n\n480/6=80,\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=80*(11 y1\u00b2 +120 )/(y1\u00b2 -120 )\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=80*(11 y1\u00b2 +120 )/(y1\u00b2 -120 )\n\nLet me denote z=y1\u00b2, so z>120.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=80*(11 z +120 )/(z -120 )\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n11 z +120=11(z -120 ) +11*120 +120=11(z -120 ) +1320 +120=11(z -120 ) +1440.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe express it as:\n\nBD\u00b2=80*(11(z -120 ) +1440 )/(z -120 )=80[11 +1440/(z -120 ) ]\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=80*11 +80*1440/(z -120 )\n\n=880 + (115200)/(z -120 )\n\nSince z>120, z-120>0, so as z approaches 120 from above, (z -120 ) approaches 0, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nAs z approaches infinity, (z -120 ) approaches z, so BD\u00b2 approaches 880 +115200/z ~880.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be as large as infinity and as small as 880.\n\nWait, wait, but earlier we had BD\u00b2=480. Now, this approach gives BD\u00b2 approaching 880 as z approaches infinity.\n\nThis is conflicting with the previous result.\n\nSo, perhaps I made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, in the first approach, we parametrized the diagonals as along certain angles, but perhaps in this second approach, we're getting a different minimal value.\n\nHmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me check the second approach again.\n\nWe started with points A(x1,y1) and B(x2,y2) on the hyperbola, with x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nWe found expressions for x2\u00b2 and y2 in terms of y1\u00b2, and then expressed BD\u00b2 in terms of y1\u00b2, getting BD\u00b2=80*(11 z +120 )/(z -120 ), where z=y1\u00b2>120.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80*(11 z +120 )/(z -120 )\n\nLet me set w=z -120, so w>0.\n\nThen,\n\nBD\u00b2=80*(11(w +120 ) +120 )/w=80*(11w +1320 +120 )/w=80*(11w +1440 )/w=80*(11 +1440/w )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=80*11 +80*1440/w=880 + 115200/w.\n\nSince w>0, as w approaches 0+, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity, and as w approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 880.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 in this approach is 880.\n\nBut in the first approach, we had BD\u00b2 approaching 480.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy.\n\nWhich approach is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps in the first approach, I made a wrong assumption about the parametrization.\n\nIn the first approach, I assumed that the diagonals are along lines with angles \u03b8 and \u03b8 +90\u00b0, but perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two approaches are considering different configurations.\n\nWait, in the second approach, we considered points A and B such that OA and OB are perpendicular, which is a different condition than the first approach.\n\nWait, in the first approach, we parametrized the points as lying along certain lines, but perhaps that's not the same as OA and OB being perpendicular.\n\nSo, perhaps the first approach was incorrect because it didn't consider that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, which implies that vectors OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I considered diagonals along certain angles, but perhaps that didn't necessarily satisfy OA \u00b7 OB =0.\n\nSo, perhaps the second approach is the correct one.\n\nSo, according to the second approach, BD\u00b2 can be as low as 880, and can be as high as infinity.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 880.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nSo, since BD\u00b2 can be as low as 880, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 880.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, the minimal BD\u00b2 was 480, but in the second approach, it's 880.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from different parametrizations.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I considered points A and C on one diagonal, and B and D on the other, with diagonals along certain angles.\n\nIn the second approach, I considered points A and B such that OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nBut in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so OA and OB would be the diagonals, which are vectors from the origin to the vertices, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are not the position vectors of the vertices, but rather the vectors connecting opposite vertices.\n\nWait, perhaps in the first approach, I confused the diagonals with the position vectors.\n\nSo, perhaps the second approach is the correct one.\n\nIn the second approach, we have BD\u00b2=880 +115200/(z -120 ), with z>120.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 880 as z approaches infinity, and approaches infinity as z approaches 120 from above.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 880, and the maximum is unbounded.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 880.\n\nBut wait, earlier in the first approach, we had BD\u00b2=480.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is 880, as per the second approach.\n\nBut to confirm, let me take specific points.\n\nLet me try to find a rhombus where BD\u00b2=880.\n\nIf z approaches infinity, then y1\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nFrom point A: x1\u00b2=20 + (5 y1\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, as y1\u00b2 approaches infinity, x1\u00b2 approaches (5/6) y1\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, x2\u00b2=120 y1\u00b2/(y1\u00b2 -120 )\u2248120 as y1\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, x2 approaches sqrt(120)=2*sqrt(30).\n\nAnd y2= -x1x2/y1\u2248 - (sqrt( (5/6)y1\u00b2 ) * sqrt(120 ) ) / y1= - (sqrt(5/6)*sqrt(120 ))= -sqrt( (5/6)*120 )= -sqrt(100)= -10.\n\nSo, point B approaches (sqrt(120 ), -10 ).\n\nSo, BD is the distance between B and D, which is 2*sqrt(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 )=2*sqrt(120 +100 )=2*sqrt(220 )=2*2*sqrt(55 )=4*sqrt(55 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= (4 sqrt(55 ))^2=16*55=880.\n\nSo, yes, as y1\u00b2 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 880.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 880.\n\nThus, the answer is 880.\n\nBut wait, in the first approach, we had a different minimal BD\u00b2. So, perhaps the first approach was incorrect.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I considered points on the hyperbola parametrized along certain angles, but perhaps that didn't account for the perpendicularity of the diagonals.\n\nTherefore, the correct minimal BD\u00b2 is 880.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 880.\n\nBut wait, in the second approach, BD\u00b2 can approach 880 from above, but never less than 880.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 880, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 880.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be 880, then for that rhombus, m must be less than 880.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 can be as close to 880 as desired, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 880.\n\nWait, but 880 is attainable, so m must be less than or equal to 880.\n\nBut the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is 880.\n\nBut in the second approach, BD\u00b2 approaches 880 as y1\u00b2 approaches infinity, so BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 880 from above, but never less than 880.\n\nTherefore, the infimum is 880, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 880.\n\nBut since 880 is attainable, perhaps the answer is 880.\n\nWait, but in the limit, BD\u00b2 approaches 880 as y1\u00b2 approaches infinity, but never actually reaches 880.\n\nWait, no, when y1\u00b2 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 880, but BD\u00b2 is always greater than 880.\n\nSo, the infimum is 880, but it's not attained.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 880.\n\nThus, the answer is 880.\n\nBut wait, in the first approach, I obtained 480, but that must have been due to a wrong assumption.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 880.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on a hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. No, wait, actually, yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Right, because a rhombus is a type of kite, and in a kite, one diagonal is the perpendicular bisector of the other. But in a rhombus, both diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So, yes, the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, since the hyperbola is centered at (0,0). So the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.\n\nSo, in the hyperbola equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, the transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x\u00b2. The transverse axis length is 2a, where a\u00b2=20, so a=2\u221a5. The conjugate axis length is 2b, where b\u00b2=24, so b=2\u221a6.\n\nNow, the points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Let me think about the properties of such a rhombus.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so if the origin is the intersection point, then each vertex is symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if A is a point (x, y), then the point opposite to A, which would be C, is (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (u, v), then D is (-u, -v).\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily the axes of the hyperbola. So, perhaps the diagonals are not aligned with the coordinate axes. Hmm, but the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes, so maybe the diagonals can be at any angle, but they must pass through the origin.\n\nBut how does this affect the coordinates of the points A, B, C, D?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the diagonals are along the coordinate axes? Because the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes, so it's possible that the diagonals of the rhombus lie along the x-axis and y-axis.\n\nWait, if the diagonals are along the axes, then points A, B, C, D would be at (p, 0), (0, q), (-p, 0), (0, -q), but that would form a kite, but not necessarily a rhombus unless p = q, but then it would be a square. But in that case, the points would lie on the hyperbola, but let's check.\n\nWait, but if points are at (p,0), (0,q), (-p,0), (0,-q), then all four points must lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo plugging (p,0) into the hyperbola equation: p\u00b2/20 - 0 =1 => p\u00b2=20 => p=\u00b1\u221a20=\u00b12\u221a5.\n\nSimilarly, plugging (0,q): 0 - q\u00b2/24=1 => q\u00b2= -24, which is impossible. So, that can't be.\n\nSo, the points can't be on the axes except for the vertices of the hyperbola, but the hyperbola doesn't have points on the y-axis. So, perhaps the diagonals aren't along the coordinate axes.\n\nTherefore, the rhombus is such that its diagonals are not aligned with the axes but still pass through the origin.\n\nSo, for a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so if one diagonal is along some line through the origin, the other is along a perpendicular line through the origin.\n\nLet me parameterize the points. Let's say that one diagonal is BD, and the other is AC.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, the diagonals are along two perpendicular lines through the origin. Let's say that one diagonal is along a line making an angle \u03b8 with the x-axis, and the other is along \u03b8 + 90 degrees.\n\nLet me denote the endpoints of diagonal BD as points B and D, and endpoints of diagonal AC as points A and C.\n\nSince the origin is the midpoint, points B and D are symmetric with respect to the origin, same with A and C.\n\nSo, if point B is (x, y), then D is (-x, -y). Similarly, point A is (u, v), so point C is (-u, -v).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nBut since the diagonals are perpendicular, the sides can be calculated in terms of the diagonals.\n\nWait, another approach: in a rhombus, the area is (d1*d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. Also, all sides can be expressed in terms of the diagonals.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to use coordinates.\n\nGiven that points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nAlso, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other at the origin.\n\nSo, points A and C are on one diagonal, points B and D on the other.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nLet me assume that diagonal AC has slope m, and diagonal BD has slope -1/m.\n\nBut wait, since the diagonals are lines through the origin, if one has slope m, the other has slope -1/m.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to use parametric equations for the diagonals.\n\nLet me consider diagonal AC lying along a line with angle \u03b8 from the x-axis, so points A and C can be represented as (t cos\u03b8, t sin\u03b8) and (-t cos\u03b8, -t sin\u03b8), where t is the length from the origin to A.\n\nSimilarly, diagonal BD lies along a line perpendicular to AC, so with angle \u03b8 + 90 degrees, so points B and D can be represented as (s sin\u03b8, -s cos\u03b8) and (-s sin\u03b8, s cos\u03b8), where s is the length from the origin to B.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write the parametric points more carefully.\n\nWait, if diagonal AC is along a line making angle \u03b8 with the x-axis, then points A and C can be represented as (a cos\u03b8, a sin\u03b8) and (-a cos\u03b8, -a sin\u03b8), where a is the distance from the origin to A (and similarly to C).\n\nSimilarly, diagonal BD is perpendicular to AC, so it makes angle \u03b8 + 90 degrees with the x-axis. So, points B and D can be represented as (b sin\u03b8, -b cos\u03b8) and (-b sin\u03b8, b cos\u03b8), where b is the distance from the origin to B (and D).\n\nWait, let me confirm the direction. The direction of BD should be perpendicular to AC. So, if AC is in direction (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8), then BD is in direction (-sin\u03b8, cos\u03b8), which is a 90-degree rotation.\n\nSo, points B and D would be (b*(-sin\u03b8), b*cos\u03b8) and (-b*(-sin\u03b8), -b*cos\u03b8) = (b sin\u03b8, -b cos\u03b8). Wait, perhaps I should write it as (b sin\u03b8, -b cos\u03b8) and (-b sin\u03b8, b cos\u03b8). So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, points:\n\nA: (a cos\u03b8, a sin\u03b8)\n\nC: (-a cos\u03b8, -a sin\u03b8)\n\nB: (b sin\u03b8, -b cos\u03b8)\n\nD: (-b sin\u03b8, b cos\u03b8)\n\nNow, all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo, substituting point A into the hyperbola equation:\n\n(a cos\u03b8)^2 /20 - (a sin\u03b8)^2 /24 = 1\n\nSimilarly, substituting point B:\n\n(b sin\u03b8)^2 /20 - (-b cos\u03b8)^2 /24 =1\n\nLet me write these equations:\n\nFor point A:\n(a\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (a\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24 =1\n\nFactor out a\u00b2:\na\u00b2 [ (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ] =1\n\nSimilarly, for point B:\n(b\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (b\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 =1\n\nFactor out b\u00b2:\nb\u00b2 [ (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ] =1\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1. a\u00b2 [ (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ] =1\n\n2. b\u00b2 [ (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ] =1\n\nLet me denote equation 1 as:\n\na\u00b2 [ (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ] =1\n\nEquation 2:\n\nb\u00b2 [ (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ] =1\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me write them more neatly.\n\nLet me compute the coefficients:\n\nCoefficient for a\u00b2:\n\ncos\u00b2\u03b8 /20 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 /24 = [ (6 cos\u00b2\u03b8 -5 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] / 120\n\nSimilarly, coefficient for b\u00b2:\n\nsin\u00b2\u03b8 /20 - cos\u00b2\u03b8 /24 = [ (6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -5 cos\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] / 120\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes:\n\na\u00b2 * (6 cos\u00b2\u03b8 -5 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) /120 =1\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 = 120 / (6 cos\u00b2\u03b8 -5 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nSimilarly, equation 2:\n\nb\u00b2 * (6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -5 cos\u00b2\u03b8 ) /120 =1\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 = 120 / (6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -5 cos\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nHmm, interesting. So, a\u00b2 and b\u00b2 are expressed in terms of \u03b8.\n\nNow, in the rhombus, the sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, etc. But since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, so AB = BC.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the sides can be found using the Pythagorean theorem with half the diagonals.\n\nWait, in a rhombus, each side can be calculated as (1/2) * sqrt(d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2). Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the length of each side is (1/2) * sqrt(d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2). Because the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, so each side is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs d1/2 and d2/2.\n\nWait, no, actually, each side is equal to sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 ). So, the side length s is sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 ) = (1/2) * sqrt(d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2).\n\nSo, in this case, the diagonals are AC and BD. The length of AC is 2a, and the length of BD is 2b. So, the side length is (1/2)*sqrt( (2a)^2 + (2b)^2 ) = (1/2)*sqrt(4a\u00b2 +4b\u00b2) )= (1/2)*2*sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2) = sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2).\n\nBut wait, in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, etc. So, let me compute AB.\n\nPoint A is (a cos\u03b8, a sin\u03b8)\n\nPoint B is (b sin\u03b8, -b cos\u03b8)\n\nSo, the distance AB is sqrt[ (a cos\u03b8 - b sin\u03b8)^2 + (a sin\u03b8 + b cos\u03b8)^2 ]\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n= sqrt[ (a cos\u03b8 - b sin\u03b8)^2 + (a sin\u03b8 + b cos\u03b8)^2 ]\n\nExpanding both squares:\n\n= sqrt[ a\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8 - 2ab cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 + b\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + a\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 2ab sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + b\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8 ]\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n-2ab cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 and +2ab sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 cancel out.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n= sqrt[ a\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8 + a\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + b\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + b\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8 ]\n\nFactor terms:\n\n= sqrt[ a\u00b2 (cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8) + b\u00b2 (sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8) ]\n\nSince cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1, this simplifies to:\n\n= sqrt[ a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ]\n\nSo, AB = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, since all sides are equal, that's consistent with the earlier result.\n\nSo, AB = sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 )\n\nBut since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, so that's correct.\n\nBut how does this help me? Maybe I need another condition.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the fact that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Which we already have, since we constructed them that way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a relationship between a and b.\n\nWait, another approach: since points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nWe already have expressions for a\u00b2 and b\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nSo, from earlier:\n\na\u00b2 = 120 / (6 cos\u00b2\u03b8 -5 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nb\u00b2 = 120 / (6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -5 cos\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nWait, but for the denominators to be positive, because a\u00b2 and b\u00b2 must be positive.\n\nSo, 6 cos\u00b2\u03b8 -5 sin\u00b2\u03b8 >0 and 6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -5 cos\u00b2\u03b8 >0.\n\nHmm, let's see:\n\nFirst inequality: 6 cos\u00b2\u03b8 -5 sin\u00b2\u03b8 >0\n\nWhich is equivalent to 6 cos\u00b2\u03b8 >5 sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nDividing both sides by cos\u00b2\u03b8 (assuming cos\u03b8 \u22600):\n\n6 >5 tan\u00b2\u03b8\n\nSo, tan\u00b2\u03b8 < 6/5 => |tan\u03b8| < sqrt(6/5) \u2248 1.095.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -5 cos\u00b2\u03b8 >0\n\nWhich is equivalent to 6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 >5 cos\u00b2\u03b8\n\nDividing both sides by cos\u00b2\u03b8 (again, assuming cos\u03b8 \u22600):\n\n6 tan\u00b2\u03b8 >5\n\nSo, tan\u00b2\u03b8 >5/6 \u22480.833.\n\nSo, combining both inequalities:\n\n5/6 < tan\u00b2\u03b8 <6/5\n\nSo, tan\u03b8 must satisfy sqrt(5/6) < |tan\u03b8| < sqrt(6/5)\n\nWhich is approximately 0.9129 < |tan\u03b8| < 1.0954.\n\nSo, \u03b8 is in the range where tan\u03b8 is between approximately 0.9129 and 1.0954, or the negative counterparts.\n\nSo, \u03b8 is in an angle where the slope is between those values.\n\nSo, okay, now, so a\u00b2 and b\u00b2 are positive only when tan\u03b8 is in that range.\n\nSo, now, I need to find BD\u00b2.\n\nBD is the diagonal from B to D, which has length 2b, so BD\u00b2 is (2b)^2 =4b\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4b\u00b2 =4*(120)/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -5 cos\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nBut I can express this in terms of tan\u03b8.\n\nLet me set t = tan\u03b8.\n\nThen, sin\u00b2\u03b8 = t\u00b2/(1 + t\u00b2), cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1/(1 + t\u00b2)\n\nSo, substituting into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4*(120)/(6*(t\u00b2/(1 + t\u00b2)) -5*(1/(1 + t\u00b2)) )\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n= [6 t\u00b2 -5 ] / (1 + t\u00b2 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 =4*120*(1 + t\u00b2)/(6 t\u00b2 -5 )\n\n= 480*(1 + t\u00b2)/(6 t\u00b2 -5 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480*(1 + t\u00b2)/(6 t\u00b2 -5 )\n\nNow, we can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 =480*(1 + t\u00b2)/(6 t\u00b2 -5 )\n\nWe need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nIn other words, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible \u03b8 (i.e., t) where t\u00b2 is in (5/6,6/5).\n\nSo, t\u00b2 \u2208 (5/6, 6/5).\n\nLet me denote u = t\u00b2, so u \u2208 (5/6,6/5).\n\nThen, BD\u00b2 as a function of u is:\n\nBD\u00b2(u) =480*(1 + u)/(6u -5 )\n\nWe need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2(u) over u \u2208 (5/6,6/5). Because the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum of BD\u00b2 over u.\n\nSo, to find the minimum of BD\u00b2(u), let's compute the derivative of BD\u00b2 with respect to u and find critical points.\n\nLet me compute BD\u00b2(u):\n\nBD\u00b2(u) =480*(1 + u)/(6u -5 )\n\nLet me denote f(u) = (1 + u)/(6u -5 )\n\nThen, BD\u00b2(u) =480*f(u)\n\nCompute derivative f\u2019(u):\n\nUsing quotient rule: f\u2019(u) = [ (1)(6u -5) - (1 + u)(6) ] / (6u -5)^2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n= [6u -5 -6(1 + u) ] = 6u -5 -6 -6u = (6u -6u) + (-5 -6) = -11\n\nSo, f\u2019(u) = (-11)/(6u -5)^2\n\nSince denominator is positive for u >5/6, the derivative is negative. So, f(u) is decreasing on u \u2208 (5/6,6/5).\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2(u) is decreasing in u, so its minimum occurs at the maximum value of u, which is u=6/5.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, BD\u00b2(u) is proportional to f(u), which is decreasing. So, BD\u00b2(u) is also decreasing in u.\n\nWait, so as u increases, BD\u00b2 decreases.\n\nSo, the minimum value of BD\u00b2 occurs at u=6/5, and the maximum occurs at u=5/6.\n\nWait, but we are to find the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is the minimum value, which is at u=6/5.\n\nWait, let me think again. Since BD\u00b2(u) is decreasing in u, when u approaches 5/6 from the right, BD\u00b2(u) approaches 480*(1 +5/6)/(6*(5/6)-5 )= let's compute that.\n\nWait, no, wait, actually, when u approaches 5/6 from the right, 6u -5 approaches 6*(5/6) -5=5-5=0 from the positive side, so denominator approaches 0+, making BD\u00b2(u) approach infinity.\n\nSimilarly, when u approaches 6/5 from the left, 6u-5 approaches 6*(6/5) -5= 36/5 -25/5=11/5.\n\nWait, no, 6*(6/5)=36/5=7.2, minus 5 is 2.2=11/5.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(u) approaches 480*(1 +6/5)/(11/5 )=480*(11/5)/(11/5)=480.\n\nWait, wait, hold on. Let me compute BD\u00b2(u) at u=6/5.\n\nBD\u00b2(u)=480*(1 +6/5)/(6*(6/5)-5)=480*(11/5)/(36/5 -25/5)=480*(11/5)/(11/5)=480.\n\nSo, at u=6/5, BD\u00b2=480.\n\nSimilarly, at u approaching 5/6 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, the function BD\u00b2(u) decreases from infinity to 480 as u increases from 5/6 to 6/5.\n\nThus, the minimum value of BD\u00b2 is 480, and it can get arbitrarily large as u approaches 5/6.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nSo, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, meaning that BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480, and can get as close to 480 as desired, but not less than 480.\n\nWait, but wait, is BD\u00b2 always greater than 480? Because when u approaches 6/5, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut hold on, when u approaches 6/5, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above?\n\nWait, let's see, when u approaches 6/5, which is the upper limit of u, from below, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nWait, no, if u approaches 6/5 from below, then BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut at u=6/5, is BD\u00b2=480? Let me check.\n\nAt u=6/5,\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(1 +6/5)/(6*(6/5)-5 )=480*(11/5)/(36/5 -25/5)=480*(11/5)/(11/5)=480.\n\nYes, exactly 480.\n\nSo, as u approaches 6/5 from below, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nWait, no, because when u increases towards 6/5, BD\u00b2 decreases towards 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, but not lower.\n\nSo, for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, but can be larger.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 is always at least 480.\n\nWait, but the question is: \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is >=480. Therefore, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because for some rhombi, BD\u00b2 is exactly 480, so you can't have a number greater than 480 that is less than all BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but in the case when BD\u00b2 can be 480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would have to be less than or equal to 480. But if you take 480, then for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=480, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2, it's equal.\n\nSo, perhaps the infimum is 480, but BD\u00b2 can't be less than 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, but since BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, the number has to be less than 480.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, we need a number m such that for every rhombus, BD\u00b2 > m, and m is as large as possible.\n\nSo, m is the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, m would be 480.\n\nBut wait, if BD\u00b2 can be 480, then m cannot be 480 because m must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, then m can't be 480 because for that particular rhombus, BD\u00b2 is 480, so m must be less than 480.\n\nWait, but if the infimum is 480, meaning that BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480 from above, but not below, then 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nSo, the greatest real number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nBecause for any m' >480, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than m' (since BD\u00b2 can be as close to 480 as desired). But for m=480, there's no rhombus with BD\u00b2 less than 480. So, 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if 480 is the infimum, meaning that BD\u00b2 can be as close to 480 as desired but never less, then 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nBut since 480 is attainable (when u=6/5, BD\u00b2=480), then 480 is actually the minimum value.\n\nWait, but in that case, for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=480, m must be less than 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number m that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is just below 480.\n\nBut since we're dealing with real numbers, the supremum of such m is 480.\n\nBut the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, perhaps the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, then any number m less than or equal to 480 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi except the one where BD\u00b2=480.\n\nWait, but if m=480, then for that particular rhombus, m is equal to BD\u00b2, not less.\n\nSo, m must be strictly less than 480.\n\nBut the question is asking for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nSo, 480 is the infimum, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480.\n\nWait, but since 480 is attainable, perhaps the answer is 480.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about it.\n\nIf BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, then 480 is the minimum. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, so 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nBut the question says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be 480, then 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for that particular rhombus.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier reasoning. Let me see.\n\nIf BD\u00b2 can be 480, then 480 is the minimal possible BD\u00b2, so for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 >=480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is m=480, because BD\u00b2 can be 480, so m cannot be higher than 480, and for any m <480, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is just slightly above 480, so m is less than BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but no, because if m=480, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, m=480 is not less than BD\u00b2, it's equal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the infimum, which is 480, but since BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but 480 is not less than 480. So, the greatest real number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the supremum of all m where m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, m must be less than or equal to 480.\n\nBut since m has to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, including the one with BD\u00b2=480, m has to be less than 480.\n\nSo, the supremum of such m is 480, but m cannot reach 480.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, in other words, m is the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 480.\n\nBut since 480 is attainable, m must be less than 480.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, another approach: think of m as the infimum. The infimum is 480, so for any \u03b5>0, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 <480 + \u03b5. But since BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, m must be 480.\n\nWait, no. If BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, then m must be less than or equal to 480, but the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, m must be less than 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest such m is 480, because any m greater than 480 would fail for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480.\n\nWait, no, if m is greater than 480, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, m is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nBut if m is exactly 480, then for that rhombus, m=480 is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, the answer must be the infimum, which is 480, but since BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, m has to be less than 480.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nSo, the supremum of all m where m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nBut since m must be less than 480, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 480, as the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nBut the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but if 480 is attainable, then 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for that rhombus.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is 480.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recompute BD\u00b2 when u=6/5.\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(1 +6/5)/(6*(6/5)-5 )\n\n=480*(11/5)/(36/5 -25/5)\n\n=480*(11/5)/(11/5)\n\n=480*(11/5)*(5/11)=480.\n\nSo, yes, BD\u00b2=480 when u=6/5.\n\nSo, in that case, the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480 exists.\n\nTherefore, for that rhombus, BD\u00b2=480.\n\nSo, the greatest real number m that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi must be less than 480.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the greatest such m.\n\nSo, the supremum of all such m is 480, but m cannot reach 480.\n\nBut in terms of real numbers, the supremum is 480, but it's not attained.\n\nBut in the context of the problem, perhaps we can just write 480 as the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so the answer is 480.\n\nBut the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so it's the greatest lower bound.\n\nBut in the real numbers, the greatest lower bound is 480, but for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 >=480. So, 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nBut the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi,\" which would mean that m must be less than BD\u00b2 for every rhombus, including the one with BD\u00b2=480.\n\nTherefore, m must be less than 480.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest such m.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but 480 is not less than 480. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the closure, so 480 is the answer.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is 480.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the function.\n\nWait, let me check the function BD\u00b2(u)=480*(1 + u)/(6u -5 )\n\nWe have u \u2208 (5/6,6/5).\n\nAt u=6/5, BD\u00b2=480.\n\nAt u approaching 5/6 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is a continuous function on u \u2208 [5/6,6/5], but u cannot be exactly 5/6 because the denominator becomes zero.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(u) is decreasing on u \u2208 (5/6,6/5), from +infty to 480.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, and the maximum is unbounded.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nBecause for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 >=480, so 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2.\n\nBut the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=480, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the answer must be less than 480.\n\nBut how much less?\n\nWait, but the infimum is 480, so for any m <480, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 < m? No, that's not right.\n\nWait, no, because BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, so for any m <480, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 < m is false, because BD\u00b2 can be 480, which is greater than m.\n\nWait, no, if m is less than 480, then for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=480, m <480 < BD\u00b2.\n\nBut for other rhombuses, BD\u00b2 can be larger than 480, but since we need m to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, m must be less than or equal to the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, if m is less than 480, then for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=480, m <480 < BD\u00b2, so it's okay. But for the rhombus where BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above, m is less than BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, because BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, so if m is less than 480, then m is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi except the one where BD\u00b2=480, but since in that case, m <480 < BD\u00b2=480 is false.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 480.\n\nIn the problem statement, it's asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nSo, if BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, then 480 is the greatest lower bound, so the answer is 480.\n\nBut since 480 is attainable, then m=480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for that rhombus.\n\nThus, the answer must be 480.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is from an Olympiad, and the answer is 480.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me think about the hyperbola.\n\nGiven the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1.\n\nWe can parametrize points on the hyperbola as (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8), but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, points on hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions.\n\nLet me set x = sqrt(20) cosh t, y = sqrt(24) sinh t.\n\nBut perhaps that's complicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the coordinates of the rhombus in terms of vectors.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular and intersect at the origin, the vectors representing the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nLet me denote vector AC as vector a, and BD as vector b, with a \u00b7 b =0.\n\nSince all four points are on the hyperbola, so points A, B, C, D can be written as (a/2, b/2), (-a/2, b/2), (-a/2, -b/2), (a/2, -b/2), but wait, no, that would be if the diagonals are aligned with the axes.\n\nBut in this case, the diagonals are arbitrary.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, if the diagonals are vectors u and v, then the four vertices are (u + v)/2, (-u + v)/2, (-u -v)/2, (u -v)/2.\n\nWait, but in this case, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points are u, -u, v, -v.\n\nWait, no, if the diagonals are vectors u and v, then the four points would be (u + v)/2, (-u + v)/2, (-u -v)/2, (u -v)/2.\n\nBut if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then the midpoints are at the origin, so the four points are (u,0), (-u,0), (0,v), (0,-v) if the diagonals are along the axes, but in our case, the diagonals are not necessarily along the axes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the rhombus as a parallelogram with perpendicular diagonals.\n\nIn that case, the coordinates can be expressed as (p, q), (-p, -q), (r, s), (-r, -s), with p*r + q*s=0 (because the diagonals are perpendicular).\n\nBut all four points lie on the hyperbola.\n\nBut this seems more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombus with perpendicular diagonals intersecting at the origin, the coordinates of the vertices satisfy that the dot product of vectors OA and OB is zero, where O is the origin.\n\nWait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, but the sides are not necessarily perpendicular to the position vectors.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that if points A, B, C, D form a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, then vectors OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nWait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so vectors OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nWait, but OA and OB are the diagonals, so their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, if points A and B are (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), then vectors OA and OB are the diagonals, so OA \u00b7 OB =0.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are AC and BD, so vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.\n\nSo, if points A and C are (x1,y1) and (-x1,-y1), and points B and D are (x2,y2) and (-x2,-y2), then vectors AC = ( -2x1, -2y1 ), BD=( -2x2, -2y2 ).\n\nTheir dot product is ( -2x1)( -2x2 ) + ( -2y1 )( -2y2 )=4x1x2 +4y1y2=0.\n\nSo, x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nSo, the dot product of vectors OA and OB is zero.\n\nThus, points A and B must satisfy x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nSo, for points A(x1,y1) and B(x2,y2) on the hyperbola, x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nBut both points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nx1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24=1,\n\nx2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24=1,\n\nand x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express y2 in terms of x1, x2, y1.\n\nFrom x1x2 + y1y2=0 => y2= - (x1x2)/y1.\n\nSubstituting into the hyperbola equation for point B:\n\nx2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo,\n\nx2\u00b2/20 - [ (x1\u00b2x2\u00b2)/(y1\u00b2) ] /24=1.\n\nBut from point A's hyperbola equation:\n\nx1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24=1 => x1\u00b2/20 =1 + y1\u00b2/24 => x1\u00b2=20 + (20 y1\u00b2)/24=20 + (5 y1\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x1\u00b2=20 + (5 y1\u00b2)/6.\n\nSimilarly, x2\u00b2=20 + (5 y2\u00b2)/6.\n\nBut y2= -x1x2/y1, so y2\u00b2= (x1\u00b2x2\u00b2)/y1\u00b2.\n\nSo, substituting into x2\u00b2=20 + (5 y2\u00b2)/6,\n\nx2\u00b2=20 + (5/6)*(x1\u00b2x2\u00b2)/y1\u00b2.\n\nRearranging,\n\nx2\u00b2 - (5/6)*(x1\u00b2x2\u00b2)/y1\u00b2=20.\n\nFactor x2\u00b2,\n\nx2\u00b2 [1 - (5 x1\u00b2)/(6 y1\u00b2) ]=20.\n\nBut from x1\u00b2=20 + (5 y1\u00b2)/6,\n\nx1\u00b2= (120 +5 y1\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo,\n\nx1\u00b2= (120 +5 y1\u00b2)/6.\n\nTherefore,\n\nx1\u00b2/(6 y1\u00b2)= (120 +5 y1\u00b2)/(6 y1\u00b2)= (120)/(6 y1\u00b2) +5/6= 20/(y1\u00b2) +5/6.\n\nSo,\n\n1 - (5 x1\u00b2)/(6 y1\u00b2)=1 - [20/(y1\u00b2) +5/6 ]=1 -5/6 -20/(y1\u00b2)=1/6 -20/(y1\u00b2).\n\nSo, going back,\n\nx2\u00b2 [1/6 -20/(y1\u00b2) ]=20.\n\nSo,\n\nx2\u00b2=20 / [1/6 -20/(y1\u00b2) ]=20 / [ (y1\u00b2 -120)/(6 y1\u00b2) ]=20 * (6 y1\u00b2)/(y1\u00b2 -120 )=120 y1\u00b2/(y1\u00b2 -120 ).\n\nSo,\n\nx2\u00b2=120 y1\u00b2/(y1\u00b2 -120 ).\n\nBut x2\u00b2 must be positive, so denominator must have the same sign as numerator.\n\nSince y1\u00b2>0, denominator y1\u00b2 -120 must be positive.\n\nSo,\n\ny1\u00b2 -120 >0 => y1\u00b2>120.\n\nSo, y1\u00b2>120.\n\nSo, now, we have expressions for x1\u00b2 and x2\u00b2 in terms of y1\u00b2.\n\nBut let's also remember that points A and B are vertices of the rhombus, so the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, but since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal.\n\nBut perhaps we can compute the side length.\n\nBut alternatively, perhaps I can express BD\u00b2 in terms of y1\u00b2.\n\nWait, point B is (x2, y2)= (x2, -x1x2/y1 ).\n\nSo, BD is the diagonal from B to D, which is from (x2, y2) to (-x2, -y2).\n\nSo, BD has length sqrt[ (2x2)^2 + (2y2)^2 ]=2 sqrt(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 ).\n\nThus, BD\u00b2=4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 ).\n\nBut y2= -x1x2/y1, so y2\u00b2= x1\u00b2x2\u00b2 / y1\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4(x2\u00b2 + x1\u00b2x2\u00b2 / y1\u00b2 )=4x2\u00b2(1 +x1\u00b2/y1\u00b2 ).\n\nFrom earlier, x2\u00b2=120 y1\u00b2/(y1\u00b2 -120 ).\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(120 y1\u00b2/(y1\u00b2 -120 ))*(1 +x1\u00b2/y1\u00b2 ).\n\nBut x1\u00b2=20 + (5 y1\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo,\n\nx1\u00b2/y1\u00b2= (20 + (5 y1\u00b2)/6 ) / y1\u00b2=20/y1\u00b2 +5/6.\n\nTherefore,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(120 y1\u00b2/(y1\u00b2 -120 ))*(1 +20/y1\u00b2 +5/6 )\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n1 +5/6=11/6.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(120 y1\u00b2/(y1\u00b2 -120 ))*(11/6 +20/y1\u00b2 )\n\n=4*(120 y1\u00b2/(y1\u00b2 -120 ))*( (11 y1\u00b2 +120 )/(6 y1\u00b2 ) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n=4*(120 y1\u00b2) * (11 y1\u00b2 +120 ) / [ (y1\u00b2 -120 ) *6 y1\u00b2 ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n=4*120*(11 y1\u00b2 +120 ) / [6(y1\u00b2 -120 ) ]\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n4*120=480,\n\n480/6=80,\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=80*(11 y1\u00b2 +120 )/(y1\u00b2 -120 )\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=80*(11 y1\u00b2 +120 )/(y1\u00b2 -120 )\n\nLet me denote z=y1\u00b2, so z>120.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=80*(11 z +120 )/(z -120 )\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n11 z +120=11(z -120 ) +11*120 +120=11(z -120 ) +1320 +120=11(z -120 ) +1440.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe express it as:\n\nBD\u00b2=80*(11(z -120 ) +1440 )/(z -120 )=80[11 +1440/(z -120 ) ]\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=80*11 +80*1440/(z -120 )\n\n=880 + (115200)/(z -120 )\n\nSince z>120, z-120>0, so as z approaches 120 from above, (z -120 ) approaches 0, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nAs z approaches infinity, (z -120 ) approaches z, so BD\u00b2 approaches 880 +115200/z ~880.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be as large as infinity and as small as 880.\n\nWait, wait, but earlier we had BD\u00b2=480. Now, this approach gives BD\u00b2 approaching 880 as z approaches infinity.\n\nThis is conflicting with the previous result.\n\nSo, perhaps I made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, in the first approach, we parametrized the diagonals as along certain angles, but perhaps in this second approach, we're getting a different minimal value.\n\nHmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me check the second approach again.\n\nWe started with points A(x1,y1) and B(x2,y2) on the hyperbola, with x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nWe found expressions for x2\u00b2 and y2 in terms of y1\u00b2, and then expressed BD\u00b2 in terms of y1\u00b2, getting BD\u00b2=80*(11 z +120 )/(z -120 ), where z=y1\u00b2>120.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80*(11 z +120 )/(z -120 )\n\nLet me set w=z -120, so w>0.\n\nThen,\n\nBD\u00b2=80*(11(w +120 ) +120 )/w=80*(11w +1320 +120 )/w=80*(11w +1440 )/w=80*(11 +1440/w )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=80*11 +80*1440/w=880 + 115200/w.\n\nSince w>0, as w approaches 0+, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity, and as w approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 880.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 in this approach is 880.\n\nBut in the first approach, we had BD\u00b2 approaching 480.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy.\n\nWhich approach is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps in the first approach, I made a wrong assumption about the parametrization.\n\nIn the first approach, I assumed that the diagonals are along lines with angles \u03b8 and \u03b8 +90\u00b0, but perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two approaches are considering different configurations.\n\nWait, in the second approach, we considered points A and B such that OA and OB are perpendicular, which is a different condition than the first approach.\n\nWait, in the first approach, we parametrized the points as lying along certain lines, but perhaps that's not the same as OA and OB being perpendicular.\n\nSo, perhaps the first approach was incorrect because it didn't consider that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, which implies that vectors OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I considered diagonals along certain angles, but perhaps that didn't necessarily satisfy OA \u00b7 OB =0.\n\nSo, perhaps the second approach is the correct one.\n\nSo, according to the second approach, BD\u00b2 can be as low as 880, and can be as high as infinity.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 880.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nSo, since BD\u00b2 can be as low as 880, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 880.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, the minimal BD\u00b2 was 480, but in the second approach, it's 880.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from different parametrizations.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I considered points A and C on one diagonal, and B and D on the other, with diagonals along certain angles.\n\nIn the second approach, I considered points A and B such that OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nBut in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so OA and OB would be the diagonals, which are vectors from the origin to the vertices, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are not the position vectors of the vertices, but rather the vectors connecting opposite vertices.\n\nWait, perhaps in the first approach, I confused the diagonals with the position vectors.\n\nSo, perhaps the second approach is the correct one.\n\nIn the second approach, we have BD\u00b2=880 +115200/(z -120 ), with z>120.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 880 as z approaches infinity, and approaches infinity as z approaches 120 from above.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 880, and the maximum is unbounded.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 880.\n\nBut wait, earlier in the first approach, we had BD\u00b2=480.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is 880, as per the second approach.\n\nBut to confirm, let me take specific points.\n\nLet me try to find a rhombus where BD\u00b2=880.\n\nIf z approaches infinity, then y1\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nFrom point A: x1\u00b2=20 + (5 y1\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, as y1\u00b2 approaches infinity, x1\u00b2 approaches (5/6) y1\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, x2\u00b2=120 y1\u00b2/(y1\u00b2 -120 )\u2248120 as y1\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, x2 approaches sqrt(120)=2*sqrt(30).\n\nAnd y2= -x1x2/y1\u2248 - (sqrt( (5/6)y1\u00b2 ) * sqrt(120 ) ) / y1= - (sqrt(5/6)*sqrt(120 ))= -sqrt( (5/6)*120 )= -sqrt(100)= -10.\n\nSo, point B approaches (sqrt(120 ), -10 ).\n\nSo, BD is the distance between B and D, which is 2*sqrt(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 )=2*sqrt(120 +100 )=2*sqrt(220 )=2*2*sqrt(55 )=4*sqrt(55 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= (4 sqrt(55 ))^2=16*55=880.\n\nSo, yes, as y1\u00b2 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 880.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 880.\n\nThus, the answer is 880.\n\nBut wait, in the first approach, we had a different minimal BD\u00b2. So, perhaps the first approach was incorrect.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I considered points on the hyperbola parametrized along certain angles, but perhaps that didn't account for the perpendicularity of the diagonals.\n\nTherefore, the correct minimal BD\u00b2 is 880.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 880.\n\nBut wait, in the second approach, BD\u00b2 can approach 880 from above, but never less than 880.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 880, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 880.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be 880, then for that rhombus, m must be less than 880.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 can be as close to 880 as desired, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 880.\n\nWait, but 880 is attainable, so m must be less than or equal to 880.\n\nBut the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is 880.\n\nBut in the second approach, BD\u00b2 approaches 880 as y1\u00b2 approaches infinity, so BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 880 from above, but never less than 880.\n\nTherefore, the infimum is 880, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 880.\n\nBut since 880 is attainable, perhaps the answer is 880.\n\nWait, but in the limit, BD\u00b2 approaches 880 as y1\u00b2 approaches infinity, but never actually reaches 880.\n\nWait, no, when y1\u00b2 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 880, but BD\u00b2 is always greater than 880.\n\nSo, the infimum is 880, but it's not attained.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 880.\n\nThus, the answer is 880.\n\nBut wait, in the first approach, I obtained 480, but that must have been due to a wrong assumption.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 880.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all rhombi \\( ABCD \\) inscribed in the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Hyperbola and Rhombus Properties**: The hyperbola is centered at the origin with \\( a^2 = 20 \\) and \\( b^2 = 24 \\). The rhombus has perpendicular diagonals intersecting at the origin, implying the diagonals are perpendicular vectors.\n\n2. **Parametrization and Conditions**: Points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) on the hyperbola satisfy \\( x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = 0 \\) (diagonals are perpendicular). Using the hyperbola equations for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), expressions for \\( x_1^2 \\), \\( x_2^2 \\), and \\( y_2 \\) in terms of \\( y_1^2 \\) are derived.\n\n3. **Expression for \\( BD^2 \\)**: After substituting and simplifying, \\( BD^2 \\) is expressed as:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = 80 \\left( 11 + \\frac{1440}{z - 120} \\right)\n   \\]\n   where \\( z = y_1^2 > 120 \\).\n\n4. **Limits and Infimum**: As \\( z \\) approaches infinity, \\( BD^2 \\) approaches 880. As \\( z \\) approaches 120 from above, \\( BD^2 \\) tends to infinity. Thus, the infimum of \\( BD^2 \\) is 880, meaning \\( BD^2 \\) can be made arbitrarily close to 880 but never less than it.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombi is **880**.\n\n\\boxed{880}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. These four points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles and are perpendicular. So yes, they intersect at right angles. So that's a key property.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that must mean that the points A, B, C, D are symmetric with respect to the origin. So if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y), right? Because the diagonals bisect each other, so the midpoint of AC is the origin. Similarly, the midpoint of BD is the origin, so if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).\n\nSo, the rhombus is determined by two pairs of points: A and C, which are opposites, and B and D, which are opposites as well. So, each pair is symmetric about the origin.\n\nNow, since all four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, both A and C must satisfy this equation, and so must B and D.\n\nSo, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, B is (p, q), and D is (-p, -q).\n\nNow, in a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, which should be equal to the distance between C and D, and so on.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way to approach this. Since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, perhaps I can use the properties of the diagonals.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, and they are perpendicular.\n\nSo, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. Let me think in terms of vectors.\n\nVector AC would be from A to C, which is (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, vector BD is from B to D, which is (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q). But since they are diagonals, their direction vectors are (x, y) and (p, q), right? Because from the origin, the diagonals go from (x, y) to (-x, -y) and from (p, q) to (-p, -q). So, the diagonals are along the lines connecting A to C and B to D.\n\nWait, but since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular. So, their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, vector AC is (x, y) to (-x, -y), but wait, actually, the vector from A to C is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, the vector from B to D is (-2p, -2q). So, the vectors AC and BD are (-2x, -2y) and (-2p, -2q). Their dot product should be zero because the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nSo, (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0 \u2192 4xp + 4yq = 0 \u2192 xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, that's one equation: xp + yq = 0.\n\nBut points A and B lie on the hyperbola, so (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1 and (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSo, now, I have these three equations:\n\n1. xp + yq = 0\n2. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n3. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nI need to find BD\u00b2. BD is the distance between points B and D, which are (p, q) and (-p, -q). So, the distance BD is sqrt[(p - (-p))\u00b2 + (q - (-q))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2p)\u00b2 + (2q)\u00b2] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Therefore, BD\u00b2 is (2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, the problem is to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi, but we need the supremum of the lower bounds. Wait, no. The question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all possible rhombi. So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all such rhombi. Because the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose BD\u00b2 can take a range of values, say from m to M. Then, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be m, because m is the smallest possible BD\u00b2, so any number less than m would not be a lower bound for all BD\u00b2. Wait, no. Wait, the question is phrased as \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the largest number L such that L \u2264 BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, L is the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because if BD\u00b2 can get as small as possible, then L must be that smallest possible BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: Suppose BD\u00b2 can be as small as possible, say approaching some limit, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be that limit. Because if BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to that limit from above, then L must be that limit. So, L is the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, I need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2 given the constraints, which is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), with the constraints that points A(x, y) and B(p, q) are on the hyperbola, and xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to minimizing 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) subject to the constraints x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1, and xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, to minimize p\u00b2 + q\u00b2, given that xp + yq = 0, and both (x, y) and (p, q) lie on the hyperbola.\n\nHmm. Let me think of this as an optimization problem. Maybe I can parameterize the points on the hyperbola.\n\nSince the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, I can write parametric equations for points on the hyperbola. For hyperbola parametrization, I can use hyperbolic functions. So, x = sqrt(20) cosh \u03b8, y = sqrt(24) sinh \u03b8. Similarly, for point B, p = sqrt(20) cosh \u03c6, q = sqrt(24) sinh \u03c6.\n\nBut then, the condition xp + yq = 0 would translate to:\n\nsqrt(20) cosh \u03b8 * sqrt(20) cosh \u03c6 + sqrt(24) sinh \u03b8 * sqrt(24) sinh \u03c6 = 0\n\nSimplify that:\n\n20 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 24 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0.\n\nSo, 20 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 24 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0.\n\nLet me factor out common terms:\n\nDivide both sides by 4: 5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0.\n\nHmm, this looks like a combination of hyperbolic functions. Maybe I can express this as a single hyperbolic function.\n\nI recall that cosh(\u03b8 - \u03c6) = cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 - sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6, and cosh(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6.\n\nBut in our case, we have 5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as:\n\n5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0\n\nLet me factor out cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6:\n\ncosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 [5 + 6 (sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6)/(cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6)] = 0.\n\nBut sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 / (cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6) = tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\ncosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 [5 + 6 tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6] = 0.\n\nSince cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 is always positive (as cosh is always positive), the term in the brackets must be zero:\n\n5 + 6 tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6 = 0.\n\nSo, 6 tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6 = -5.\n\nHmm, so tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut tanh \u03b8 and tanh \u03c6 are both between -1 and 1. So, their product is -5/6, which is approximately -0.8333.\n\nBut let's see if this is possible. Let me denote a = tanh \u03b8 and b = tanh \u03c6. So, ab = -5/6.\n\nSince a and b are between -1 and 1, their product can be as low as -1 and as high as 1. But -5/6 is about -0.8333, which is within the possible range. So, it's feasible.\n\nSo, from this, we can write b = (-5)/(6a).\n\nBut since |a| \u2264 1 and |b| \u2264 1, let's find the constraints on a.\n\nGiven that b = (-5)/(6a), then |b| = |5/(6a)| \u2264 1.\n\nSo, |5/(6a)| \u2264 1 \u2192 |a| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, a must satisfy |a| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSimilarly, since a = tanh \u03b8, and tanh \u03b8 approaches 1 as \u03b8 approaches infinity, so 5/6 is achievable.\n\nSo, now, with a = tanh \u03b8, b = tanh \u03c6 = (-5)/(6a).\n\nSo, now, I can express p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 in terms of \u03c6, but perhaps it's better to express in terms of a and b.\n\nWait, let me think about p and q.\n\np = sqrt(20) cosh \u03c6, q = sqrt(24) sinh \u03c6.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20 cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSimilarly, cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 = 1 + sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20(1 + sinh\u00b2 \u03c6) + 24 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 = 20 + 44 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nBut sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 can be expressed in terms of tanh \u03c6.\n\nSince sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 = tanh\u00b2 \u03c6 / (1 - tanh\u00b2 \u03c6).\n\nSo, sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 = b\u00b2 / (1 - b\u00b2).\n\nThus, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20 + 44*(b\u00b2)/(1 - b\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, since b = (-5)/(6a), we can write this in terms of a.\n\nBut maybe I can express everything in terms of a.\n\nGiven that b = (-5)/(6a), let's compute b\u00b2 = (25)/(36a\u00b2).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20 + 44*(25/(36a\u00b2)) / (1 - 25/(36a\u00b2)).\n\nSimplify that:\n\n= 20 + 44*(25)/(36a\u00b2 - 25).\n\nWait, let me do this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute denominator: 1 - b\u00b2 = 1 - (25)/(36a\u00b2) = (36a\u00b2 - 25)/(36a\u00b2).\n\nSo, sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 = b\u00b2 / (1 - b\u00b2) = (25/(36a\u00b2)) / ( (36a\u00b2 - 25)/(36a\u00b2) ) ) = 25/(36a\u00b2) * (36a\u00b2)/(36a\u00b2 -25) ) = 25/(36a\u00b2 -25).\n\nSo, sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 = 25/(36a\u00b2 -25).\n\nTherefore, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20 + 44*(25)/(36a\u00b2 -25).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20 + (1100)/(36a\u00b2 -25).\n\nNow, I can write this as a function of a:\n\nf(a) = 20 + 1100/(36a\u00b2 -25), where |a| \u2265 5/6.\n\nOur goal is to minimize f(a), because BD\u00b2 = 4*(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 4*f(a).\n\nSo, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize f(a).\n\nSo, let's set t = a\u00b2. Since |a| \u22655/6, t \u2265 (25/36).\n\nSo, f(t) = 20 + 1100/(36t -25), t \u226525/36.\n\nWe need to find the minimum of f(t) over t \u226525/36.\n\nTo find the minimum, take derivative with respect to t:\n\ndf/dt = -1100*(36)/(36t -25)^2.\n\nWait, derivative of 1100/(36t -25) is -1100*36/(36t -25)^2.\n\nSo, df/dt = - (1100 * 36)/(36t -25)^2.\n\nBut since t \u226525/36, denominator is positive, so df/dt is negative.\n\nSo, f(t) is a decreasing function of t in the domain t \u226525/36.\n\nTherefore, the minimum occurs as t approaches infinity.\n\nWait, that can't be right because as t approaches infinity, 36t -25 approaches infinity, so 1100/(36t -25) approaches 0, so f(t) approaches 20.\n\nBut wait, that suggests that f(t) can be as low as 20, but when t approaches infinity, a approaches infinity, which is not possible because a = tanh \u03b8, which approaches 1 as \u03b8 approaches infinity. So, perhaps my substitution is flawed.\n\nWait, wait, a = tanh \u03b8, so a approaches 1 as \u03b8 approaches infinity, not infinity. So, t = a\u00b2 approaches 1.\n\nSo, t cannot be greater than 1. Because tanh \u03b8 \u22641.\n\nSo, t \u2208 [25/36, 1].\n\nSo, t ranges from 25/36 (\u22480.694) to 1.\n\nSo, f(t) = 20 + 1100/(36t -25), with t \u2208 [25/36,1].\n\nSo, 36t -25 is in [0, 36*1 -25=11].\n\nAt t=25/36, denominator is 36*(25/36) -25 =25 -25=0. So, f(t) approaches infinity as t approaches 25/36 from above.\n\nAt t=1, denominator is 36*1 -25=11, so f(1)=20 + 1100/11=20 + 100=120.\n\nSo, f(t) decreases from infinity to 120 as t increases from 25/36 to 1.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought f(t) is decreasing, but that was before considering the domain of t.\n\nSo, in the domain t \u2208 [25/36,1], f(t) is decreasing, so the minimum of f(t) is 120, achieved at t=1.\n\nBut that can't be right because when t approaches 25/36, f(t) tends to infinity, and at t=1, f(t)=120. So, the minimal value of f(t) is 120.\n\nBut wait, that contradicts the initial thought that BD\u00b2 can be minimized.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that BD\u00b2 is 4*(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) =4*f(a). So, if f(t) can be as low as 120, then BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480.\n\nBut wait, this seems too high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, maybe I made a mistake in the parametrization.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parameterize points A and B differently. Because in a rhombus, the sides are equal, so the vectors AB and AD should have the same length.\n\nWait, maybe another approach would be better.\n\nLet me consider that in the rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nBut since the diagonals are along the lines connecting (x, y) to (-x, -y) and (p, q) to (-p, -q), their slopes would be (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x for AC, and (q - (-q))/(p - (-p)) = 2q/(2p) = q/p for BD.\n\nSo, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1:\n\n(y/x) * (q/p) = -1 \u2192 yq / (xp) = -1 \u2192 yq = -xp.\n\nWhich is the same as xp + yq = 0, which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nNow, to find BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize p\u00b2 + q\u00b2.\n\nGiven the hyperbola equations for both points and the condition xp + yq = 0.\n\nLet me try to express y in terms of x and substitute into the condition.\n\nFrom the hyperbola equation, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 \u2192 y\u00b2 = (x\u00b2/20 -1)*24.\n\nSimilarly, for point B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1 \u2192 q\u00b2 = (p\u00b2/20 -1)*24.\n\nFrom the condition xp + yq =0, we can write y = (-xp)/q.\n\nSubstituting into y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2 = (x\u00b2p\u00b2)/(q\u00b2).\n\nBut from the hyperbola, y\u00b2 = (x\u00b2/20 -1)*24.\n\nSo,\n\n(x\u00b2p\u00b2)/(q\u00b2) = (x\u00b2/20 -1)*24.\n\nBut from point B's hyperbola equation, q\u00b2 = (p\u00b2/20 -1)*24.\n\nSo, substituting q\u00b2:\n\n(x\u00b2p\u00b2)/( (p\u00b2/20 -1)*24 ) = (x\u00b2/20 -1)*24.\n\nMultiply both sides by (p\u00b2/20 -1)*24:\n\nx\u00b2p\u00b2 = [ (x\u00b2/20 -1)*24 ] * [ (p\u00b2/20 -1)*24 ]\n\nLet me denote u = x\u00b2/20 and v = p\u00b2/20. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n(20u)(20v) = [ (u - 1)*24 ] * [ (v - 1)*24 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n400uv = (24)^2 (u -1)(v -1)\n\n400uv = 576 (uv - u - v +1 )\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n400uv -576uv +576u +576v -576 =0\n\n-176uv +576u +576v -576=0\n\nDivide both sides by -16 to simplify:\n\n11uv -36u -36v +36=0\n\nSo, 11uv -36u -36v +36=0.\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic in two variables. Maybe I can rearrange terms.\n\n11uv -36u -36v = -36.\n\nLet me factor this equation:\n\n11uv -36u -36v = -36.\n\nLet me add 36 to both sides:\n\n11uv -36u -36v +36 =0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can factor by grouping.\n\nLet me see:\n\n11uv -36u -36v +36 =0.\n\nGroup terms:\n\n(11uv -36u) + (-36v +36) =0.\n\nFactor u from the first group and -36 from the second:\n\nu(11v -36) -36(v -1)=0.\n\nHmm, not particularly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as:\n\n11uv -36u -36v = -36.\n\nLet me add 36 to both sides:\n\n11uv -36u -36v +36=0.\n\nWait, same as before. Maybe I can factor this as:\n\n(11u -36)(v - something) = something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using substitution.\n\nLet me let s = u + something, t = v + something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using substitution variables.\n\nLet me try to solve for u in terms of v.\n\nFrom 11uv -36u -36v = -36.\n\nBring terms with u to one side:\n\nu(11v -36) =36v -36.\n\nSo,\n\nu = (36v -36)/(11v -36).\n\nSimilarly, since u = x\u00b2/20 and v = p\u00b2/20, they must be positive, and u \u22651 because x\u00b2/20 must be at least 1 for the hyperbola. Similarly, v \u22651.\n\nSo, u \u22651 and v \u22651.\n\nSo, let's write u = (36v -36)/(11v -36).\n\nSince u must be \u22651, let's set (36v -36)/(11v -36) \u22651.\n\nSo,\n\n(36v -36)/(11v -36) \u22651.\n\nMultiply both sides by (11v -36). But we have to be careful about the sign of the denominator.\n\nCase 1: 11v -36 >0 \u2192 v > 36/11 \u22483.2727.\n\nThen, inequality becomes 36v -36 \u226511v -36 \u2192 36v -36 \u226511v -36 \u2192 25v \u22650 \u2192 v \u22650. Which is always true since v \u22651.\n\nSo, for v >36/11, the inequality holds.\n\nCase 2: 11v -36 <0 \u2192 v <36/11.\n\nThen, multiplying both sides reverses the inequality:\n\n36v -36 \u226411v -36 \u2192 36v -36 \u226411v -36 \u219225v \u22640 \u2192v \u22640.\n\nBut v \u22651, so this case is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the inequality holds only when v >36/11.\n\nSo, v must be greater than 36/11.\n\nTherefore, u = (36v -36)/(11v -36) = [36(v -1)]/[11v -36].\n\nSo, since v >36/11, let's write this as:\n\nu = [36(v -1)]/[11v -36].\n\nWe can express u in terms of v.\n\nNow, since u = x\u00b2/20 and v = p\u00b2/20, both u and v are positive.\n\nNow, our goal is to express p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 in terms of v.\n\nFrom point B: q\u00b2 = (v -1)*24.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =20v +24(v -1)=20v +24v -24=44v -24.\n\nWait, that's interesting.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=44v -24.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(44v -24)=176v -96.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=176v -96.\n\nBut we need to express this in terms of u or find a relationship between u and v.\n\nWait, but u is expressed in terms of v: u = [36(v -1)]/[11v -36].\n\nBut u is also equal to x\u00b2/20, which must satisfy the hyperbola equation for point A.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find the minimum of BD\u00b2=176v -96, given that v>36/11.\n\nSo, as v increases, BD\u00b2 increases. Therefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs at the minimal possible v, which is just above 36/11.\n\nWait, but v must be greater than 36/11, so the minimal BD\u00b2 is when v approaches 36/11 from above.\n\nSo, as v approaches 36/11, BD\u00b2 approaches 176*(36/11) -96.\n\nCompute 176*(36/11): 176/11=16, so 16*36=576.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 576 -96=480.\n\nBut v cannot be equal to 36/11, as that would make the denominator zero in u's expression, but as v approaches 36/11 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut is this achievable? Because when v approaches 36/11, u approaches [36(v-1)]/[11v -36].\n\nPlugging v=36/11 into numerator: 36*(36/11 -1)=36*(25/11)=900/11.\n\nDenominator: 11*(36/11) -36=36 -36=0.\n\nSo, u approaches infinity as v approaches 36/11 from above.\n\nBut u =x\u00b2/20, which is infinity, so x would be infinity, which is not possible for a real point on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as v approaches 36/11, but cannot actually reach 480 because that would require x to be infinite, which isn't allowed.\n\nTherefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, 480 is the infimum, so any number less than 480 would not be the greatest such number. Wait, actually, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the infimum, because BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 from above, but never less than 480. So, 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nBut wait, I thought BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as v approaches 36/11, but BD\u00b2 can't actually be 480. So, the infimum is 480, meaning that BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480. Because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, so 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm. If BD\u00b2 can approach 480, but never actually reach it, then 480 is the infimum. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, since BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 480.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. These four points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles and are perpendicular. So yes, they intersect at right angles. So that's a key property.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that must mean that the points A, B, C, D are symmetric with respect to the origin. So if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y), right? Because the diagonals bisect each other, so the midpoint of AC is the origin. Similarly, the midpoint of BD is the origin, so if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).\n\nSo, the rhombus is determined by two pairs of points: A and C, which are opposites, and B and D, which are opposites as well. So, each pair is symmetric about the origin.\n\nNow, since all four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, both A and C must satisfy this equation, and so must B and D.\n\nSo, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, B is (p, q), and D is (-p, -q).\n\nNow, in a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, which should be equal to the distance between C and D, and so on.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way to approach this. Since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, perhaps I can use the properties of the diagonals.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, and they are perpendicular.\n\nSo, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. Let me think in terms of vectors.\n\nVector AC would be from A to C, which is (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, vector BD is from B to D, which is (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q). But since they are diagonals, their direction vectors are (x, y) and (p, q), right? Because from the origin, the diagonals go from (x, y) to (-x, -y) and from (p, q) to (-p, -q). So, the diagonals are along the lines connecting A to C and B to D.\n\nWait, but since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular. So, their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, vector AC is (x, y) to (-x, -y), but wait, actually, the vector from A to C is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, the vector from B to D is (-2p, -2q). So, the vectors AC and BD are (-2x, -2y) and (-2p, -2q). Their dot product should be zero because the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nSo, (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0 \u2192 4xp + 4yq = 0 \u2192 xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, that's one equation: xp + yq = 0.\n\nBut points A and B lie on the hyperbola, so (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1 and (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSo, now, I have these three equations:\n\n1. xp + yq = 0\n2. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n3. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nI need to find BD\u00b2. BD is the distance between points B and D, which are (p, q) and (-p, -q). So, the distance BD is sqrt[(p - (-p))\u00b2 + (q - (-q))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2p)\u00b2 + (2q)\u00b2] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Therefore, BD\u00b2 is (2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, the problem is to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi, but we need the supremum of the lower bounds. Wait, no. The question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all possible rhombi. So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all such rhombi. Because the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose BD\u00b2 can take a range of values, say from m to M. Then, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be m, because m is the smallest possible BD\u00b2, so any number less than m would not be a lower bound for all BD\u00b2. Wait, no. Wait, the question is phrased as \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the largest number L such that L \u2264 BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, L is the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because if BD\u00b2 can get as small as possible, then L must be that smallest possible BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: Suppose BD\u00b2 can be as small as possible, say approaching some limit, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be that limit. Because if BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to that limit from above, then L must be that limit. So, L is the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, I need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2 given the constraints, which is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), with the constraints that points A(x, y) and B(p, q) are on the hyperbola, and xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to minimizing 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) subject to the constraints x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1, and xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, to minimize p\u00b2 + q\u00b2, given that xp + yq = 0, and both (x, y) and (p, q) lie on the hyperbola.\n\nHmm. Let me think of this as an optimization problem. Maybe I can parameterize the points on the hyperbola.\n\nSince the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, I can write parametric equations for points on the hyperbola. For hyperbola parametrization, I can use hyperbolic functions. So, x = sqrt(20) cosh \u03b8, y = sqrt(24) sinh \u03b8. Similarly, for point B, p = sqrt(20) cosh \u03c6, q = sqrt(24) sinh \u03c6.\n\nBut then, the condition xp + yq = 0 would translate to:\n\nsqrt(20) cosh \u03b8 * sqrt(20) cosh \u03c6 + sqrt(24) sinh \u03b8 * sqrt(24) sinh \u03c6 = 0\n\nSimplify that:\n\n20 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 24 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0.\n\nSo, 20 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 24 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0.\n\nLet me factor out common terms:\n\nDivide both sides by 4: 5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0.\n\nHmm, this looks like a combination of hyperbolic functions. Maybe I can express this as a single hyperbolic function.\n\nI recall that cosh(\u03b8 - \u03c6) = cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 - sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6, and cosh(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6.\n\nBut in our case, we have 5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as:\n\n5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0\n\nLet me factor out cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6:\n\ncosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 [5 + 6 (sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6)/(cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6)] = 0.\n\nBut sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 / (cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6) = tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\ncosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 [5 + 6 tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6] = 0.\n\nSince cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 is always positive (as cosh is always positive), the term in the brackets must be zero:\n\n5 + 6 tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6 = 0.\n\nSo, 6 tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6 = -5.\n\nHmm, so tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut tanh \u03b8 and tanh \u03c6 are both between -1 and 1. So, their product is -5/6, which is approximately -0.8333.\n\nBut let's see if this is possible. Let me denote a = tanh \u03b8 and b = tanh \u03c6. So, ab = -5/6.\n\nSince a and b are between -1 and 1, their product can be as low as -1 and as high as 1. But -5/6 is about -0.8333, which is within the possible range. So, it's feasible.\n\nSo, from this, we can write b = (-5)/(6a).\n\nBut since |a| \u2264 1 and |b| \u2264 1, let's find the constraints on a.\n\nGiven that b = (-5)/(6a), then |b| = |5/(6a)| \u2264 1.\n\nSo, |5/(6a)| \u2264 1 \u2192 |a| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, a must satisfy |a| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSimilarly, since a = tanh \u03b8, and tanh \u03b8 approaches 1 as \u03b8 approaches infinity, so 5/6 is achievable.\n\nSo, now, with a = tanh \u03b8, b = tanh \u03c6 = (-5)/(6a).\n\nSo, now, I can express p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 in terms of \u03c6, but perhaps it's better to express in terms of a and b.\n\nWait, let me think about p and q.\n\np = sqrt(20) cosh \u03c6, q = sqrt(24) sinh \u03c6.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20 cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSimilarly, cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 = 1 + sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20(1 + sinh\u00b2 \u03c6) + 24 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 = 20 + 44 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nBut sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 can be expressed in terms of tanh \u03c6.\n\nSince sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 = tanh\u00b2 \u03c6 / (1 - tanh\u00b2 \u03c6).\n\nSo, sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 = b\u00b2 / (1 - b\u00b2).\n\nThus, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20 + 44*(b\u00b2)/(1 - b\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, since b = (-5)/(6a), we can write this in terms of a.\n\nBut maybe I can express everything in terms of a.\n\nGiven that b = (-5)/(6a), let's compute b\u00b2 = (25)/(36a\u00b2).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20 + 44*(25/(36a\u00b2)) / (1 - 25/(36a\u00b2)).\n\nSimplify that:\n\n= 20 + 44*(25)/(36a\u00b2 - 25).\n\nWait, let me do this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute denominator: 1 - b\u00b2 = 1 - (25)/(36a\u00b2) = (36a\u00b2 - 25)/(36a\u00b2).\n\nSo, sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 = b\u00b2 / (1 - b\u00b2) = (25/(36a\u00b2)) / ( (36a\u00b2 - 25)/(36a\u00b2) ) ) = 25/(36a\u00b2) * (36a\u00b2)/(36a\u00b2 -25) ) = 25/(36a\u00b2 -25).\n\nSo, sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 = 25/(36a\u00b2 -25).\n\nTherefore, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20 + 44*(25)/(36a\u00b2 -25).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20 + (1100)/(36a\u00b2 -25).\n\nNow, I can write this as a function of a:\n\nf(a) = 20 + 1100/(36a\u00b2 -25), where |a| \u2265 5/6.\n\nOur goal is to minimize f(a), because BD\u00b2 = 4*(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 4*f(a).\n\nSo, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize f(a).\n\nSo, let's set t = a\u00b2. Since |a| \u22655/6, t \u2265 (25/36).\n\nSo, f(t) = 20 + 1100/(36t -25), t \u226525/36.\n\nWe need to find the minimum of f(t) over t \u226525/36.\n\nTo find the minimum, take derivative with respect to t:\n\ndf/dt = -1100*(36)/(36t -25)^2.\n\nWait, derivative of 1100/(36t -25) is -1100*36/(36t -25)^2.\n\nSo, df/dt = - (1100 * 36)/(36t -25)^2.\n\nBut since t \u226525/36, denominator is positive, so df/dt is negative.\n\nSo, f(t) is a decreasing function of t in the domain t \u226525/36.\n\nTherefore, the minimum occurs as t approaches infinity.\n\nWait, that can't be right because as t approaches infinity, 36t -25 approaches infinity, so 1100/(36t -25) approaches 0, so f(t) approaches 20.\n\nBut wait, that suggests that f(t) can be as low as 20, but when t approaches infinity, a approaches infinity, which is not possible because a = tanh \u03b8, which approaches 1 as \u03b8 approaches infinity. So, perhaps my substitution is flawed.\n\nWait, wait, a = tanh \u03b8, so a approaches 1 as \u03b8 approaches infinity, not infinity. So, t = a\u00b2 approaches 1.\n\nSo, t cannot be greater than 1. Because tanh \u03b8 \u22641.\n\nSo, t \u2208 [25/36, 1].\n\nSo, t ranges from 25/36 (\u22480.694) to 1.\n\nSo, f(t) = 20 + 1100/(36t -25), with t \u2208 [25/36,1].\n\nSo, 36t -25 is in [0, 36*1 -25=11].\n\nAt t=25/36, denominator is 36*(25/36) -25 =25 -25=0. So, f(t) approaches infinity as t approaches 25/36 from above.\n\nAt t=1, denominator is 36*1 -25=11, so f(1)=20 + 1100/11=20 + 100=120.\n\nSo, f(t) decreases from infinity to 120 as t increases from 25/36 to 1.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought f(t) is decreasing, but that was before considering the domain of t.\n\nSo, in the domain t \u2208 [25/36,1], f(t) is decreasing, so the minimum of f(t) is 120, achieved at t=1.\n\nBut that can't be right because when t approaches 25/36, f(t) tends to infinity, and at t=1, f(t)=120. So, the minimal value of f(t) is 120.\n\nBut wait, that contradicts the initial thought that BD\u00b2 can be minimized.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that BD\u00b2 is 4*(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) =4*f(a). So, if f(t) can be as low as 120, then BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480.\n\nBut wait, this seems too high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, maybe I made a mistake in the parametrization.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parameterize points A and B differently. Because in a rhombus, the sides are equal, so the vectors AB and AD should have the same length.\n\nWait, maybe another approach would be better.\n\nLet me consider that in the rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nBut since the diagonals are along the lines connecting (x, y) to (-x, -y) and (p, q) to (-p, -q), their slopes would be (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x for AC, and (q - (-q))/(p - (-p)) = 2q/(2p) = q/p for BD.\n\nSo, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1:\n\n(y/x) * (q/p) = -1 \u2192 yq / (xp) = -1 \u2192 yq = -xp.\n\nWhich is the same as xp + yq = 0, which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nNow, to find BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize p\u00b2 + q\u00b2.\n\nGiven the hyperbola equations for both points and the condition xp + yq = 0.\n\nLet me try to express y in terms of x and substitute into the condition.\n\nFrom the hyperbola equation, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 \u2192 y\u00b2 = (x\u00b2/20 -1)*24.\n\nSimilarly, for point B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1 \u2192 q\u00b2 = (p\u00b2/20 -1)*24.\n\nFrom the condition xp + yq =0, we can write y = (-xp)/q.\n\nSubstituting into y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2 = (x\u00b2p\u00b2)/(q\u00b2).\n\nBut from the hyperbola, y\u00b2 = (x\u00b2/20 -1)*24.\n\nSo,\n\n(x\u00b2p\u00b2)/(q\u00b2) = (x\u00b2/20 -1)*24.\n\nBut from point B's hyperbola equation, q\u00b2 = (p\u00b2/20 -1)*24.\n\nSo, substituting q\u00b2:\n\n(x\u00b2p\u00b2)/( (p\u00b2/20 -1)*24 ) = (x\u00b2/20 -1)*24.\n\nMultiply both sides by (p\u00b2/20 -1)*24:\n\nx\u00b2p\u00b2 = [ (x\u00b2/20 -1)*24 ] * [ (p\u00b2/20 -1)*24 ]\n\nLet me denote u = x\u00b2/20 and v = p\u00b2/20. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n(20u)(20v) = [ (u - 1)*24 ] * [ (v - 1)*24 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n400uv = (24)^2 (u -1)(v -1)\n\n400uv = 576 (uv - u - v +1 )\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n400uv -576uv +576u +576v -576 =0\n\n-176uv +576u +576v -576=0\n\nDivide both sides by -16 to simplify:\n\n11uv -36u -36v +36=0\n\nSo, 11uv -36u -36v +36=0.\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic in two variables. Maybe I can rearrange terms.\n\n11uv -36u -36v = -36.\n\nLet me factor this equation:\n\n11uv -36u -36v = -36.\n\nLet me add 36 to both sides:\n\n11uv -36u -36v +36 =0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can factor by grouping.\n\nLet me see:\n\n11uv -36u -36v +36 =0.\n\nGroup terms:\n\n(11uv -36u) + (-36v +36) =0.\n\nFactor u from the first group and -36 from the second:\n\nu(11v -36) -36(v -1)=0.\n\nHmm, not particularly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as:\n\n11uv -36u -36v = -36.\n\nLet me add 36 to both sides:\n\n11uv -36u -36v +36=0.\n\nWait, same as before. Maybe I can factor this as:\n\n(11u -36)(v - something) = something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using substitution.\n\nLet me let s = u + something, t = v + something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using substitution variables.\n\nLet me try to solve for u in terms of v.\n\nFrom 11uv -36u -36v = -36.\n\nBring terms with u to one side:\n\nu(11v -36) =36v -36.\n\nSo,\n\nu = (36v -36)/(11v -36).\n\nSimilarly, since u = x\u00b2/20 and v = p\u00b2/20, they must be positive, and u \u22651 because x\u00b2/20 must be at least 1 for the hyperbola. Similarly, v \u22651.\n\nSo, u \u22651 and v \u22651.\n\nSo, let's write u = (36v -36)/(11v -36).\n\nSince u must be \u22651, let's set (36v -36)/(11v -36) \u22651.\n\nSo,\n\n(36v -36)/(11v -36) \u22651.\n\nMultiply both sides by (11v -36). But we have to be careful about the sign of the denominator.\n\nCase 1: 11v -36 >0 \u2192 v > 36/11 \u22483.2727.\n\nThen, inequality becomes 36v -36 \u226511v -36 \u2192 36v -36 \u226511v -36 \u2192 25v \u22650 \u2192 v \u22650. Which is always true since v \u22651.\n\nSo, for v >36/11, the inequality holds.\n\nCase 2: 11v -36 <0 \u2192 v <36/11.\n\nThen, multiplying both sides reverses the inequality:\n\n36v -36 \u226411v -36 \u2192 36v -36 \u226411v -36 \u219225v \u22640 \u2192v \u22640.\n\nBut v \u22651, so this case is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the inequality holds only when v >36/11.\n\nSo, v must be greater than 36/11.\n\nTherefore, u = (36v -36)/(11v -36) = [36(v -1)]/[11v -36].\n\nSo, since v >36/11, let's write this as:\n\nu = [36(v -1)]/[11v -36].\n\nWe can express u in terms of v.\n\nNow, since u = x\u00b2/20 and v = p\u00b2/20, both u and v are positive.\n\nNow, our goal is to express p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 in terms of v.\n\nFrom point B: q\u00b2 = (v -1)*24.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =20v +24(v -1)=20v +24v -24=44v -24.\n\nWait, that's interesting.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=44v -24.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(44v -24)=176v -96.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=176v -96.\n\nBut we need to express this in terms of u or find a relationship between u and v.\n\nWait, but u is expressed in terms of v: u = [36(v -1)]/[11v -36].\n\nBut u is also equal to x\u00b2/20, which must satisfy the hyperbola equation for point A.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find the minimum of BD\u00b2=176v -96, given that v>36/11.\n\nSo, as v increases, BD\u00b2 increases. Therefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs at the minimal possible v, which is just above 36/11.\n\nWait, but v must be greater than 36/11, so the minimal BD\u00b2 is when v approaches 36/11 from above.\n\nSo, as v approaches 36/11, BD\u00b2 approaches 176*(36/11) -96.\n\nCompute 176*(36/11): 176/11=16, so 16*36=576.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 576 -96=480.\n\nBut v cannot be equal to 36/11, as that would make the denominator zero in u's expression, but as v approaches 36/11 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut is this achievable? Because when v approaches 36/11, u approaches [36(v-1)]/[11v -36].\n\nPlugging v=36/11 into numerator: 36*(36/11 -1)=36*(25/11)=900/11.\n\nDenominator: 11*(36/11) -36=36 -36=0.\n\nSo, u approaches infinity as v approaches 36/11 from above.\n\nBut u =x\u00b2/20, which is infinity, so x would be infinity, which is not possible for a real point on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as v approaches 36/11, but cannot actually reach 480 because that would require x to be infinite, which isn't allowed.\n\nTherefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, 480 is the infimum, so any number less than 480 would not be the greatest such number. Wait, actually, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the infimum, because BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 from above, but never less than 480. So, 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nBut wait, I thought BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as v approaches 36/11, but BD\u00b2 can't actually be 480. So, the infimum is 480, meaning that BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480. Because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, so 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm. If BD\u00b2 can approach 480, but never actually reach it, then 480 is the infimum. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, since BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 480.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus \\(ABCD\\) inscribed in the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) are perpendicular, and their midpoints are the origin. Points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) satisfy the hyperbola equation, and their coordinates are related by symmetry.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Hyperbola Parametrization**: Points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) on the hyperbola can be parameterized using hyperbolic functions:\n   \\[\n   A = (\\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\theta, \\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\theta), \\quad B = (\\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\phi, \\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\phi).\n   \\]\n2. **Perpendicular Diagonals Condition**: The diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) are perpendicular, leading to the condition:\n   \\[\n   \\tanh \\theta \\tanh \\phi = -\\frac{5}{6}.\n   \\]\n3. **Expression for \\(BD^2\\)**: Using the coordinates of \\(B\\) and \\(D\\), the squared length of diagonal \\(BD\\) is:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = 4(p^2 + q^2),\n   \\]\n   where \\(p = \\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\phi\\) and \\(q = \\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\phi\\).\n4. **Minimizing \\(BD^2\\)**: By analyzing the constraints and using substitutions, we find that \\(BD^2\\) approaches its minimum value as the parameters approach certain limits. The infimum of \\(BD^2\\) is found to be 480.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe greatest real number that is less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is the infimum of \\(BD^2\\), which is **480**.\n\n\\(\\boxed{480}\\)",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it out.\n\nThe hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis with length 2a, where a\u00b2 = 20, so a = sqrt(20). The conjugate axis is 2b, with b\u00b2 = 24, so b = sqrt(24).\n\nNow, the problem says that points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, and its diagonals intersect there.\n\nI know that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at 90 degrees. Wait, no, correction: In a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing with a square. Let me recall: In a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. So, yes, they are perpendicular. So, the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n\nSo, in this case, since the rhombus is centered at the origin, the diagonals intersect at the origin, and they are perpendicular. So, if one diagonal is, say, along the x-axis, the other would be along the y-axis. But since the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes, maybe the rhombus is symmetric with respect to both axes.\n\nBut wait, the hyperbola is symmetric about both the x-axis and y-axis, so if the rhombus has its diagonals along these axes, that might be a good way to model it.\n\nBut maybe the diagonals aren't necessarily aligned with the axes. Hmm, but the diagonals intersect at the origin, so they could be at any angle, but still, they need to be perpendicular.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the rhombus with its diagonals along the coordinate axes, but I'm not sure yet. Let me think.\n\nLet me consider that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, if I denote the diagonals as AC and BD, with AC and BD intersecting at the origin, then the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.\n\nSo, the coordinates of the four vertices can be written as follows: Let\u2019s say the diagonal AC has points A and C, and BD has points B and D. Since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, the coordinates of A would be (p, q), so C would be (-p, -q). Similarly, B would be (r, s), so D would be (-r, -s).\n\nBut since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, which should be equal to the distance from C to D, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to parametrize the points on the hyperbola.\n\nSince the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, any point on the hyperbola can be represented as (sqrt(20) sec \u03b8, sqrt(24) tan \u03b8), but maybe it's easier to parametrize using hyperbola functions.\n\nAlternatively, since the hyperbola is symmetric, maybe we can let the points A and C be (a, b) and (-a, -b), and points B and D be (c, d) and (-c, -d). Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to consider the vectors. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, and the rhombus is centered at the origin, perhaps the diagonals are the vectors OA and OC, and OB and OD, where OA and OC are along one diagonal, and OB and OD along the other.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are not sides, they are the lines connecting opposite vertices. So, in this case, A and C are opposite vertices connected by diagonal AC, and B and D are opposite vertices connected by diagonal BD.\n\nGiven that, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, and since the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals, the coordinates of A are (p, q), so C is (-p, -q); similarly, B is (r, s), so D is (-r, -s).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all four sides must be equal in length. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, which equals the distance between C and D, and so on.\n\nSo, the distance AB should equal BC, which should equal CD, which equals DA.\n\nLet me compute AB\u00b2 and BC\u00b2 in terms of p, q, r, s.\n\nAB\u00b2 = (p - r)\u00b2 + (q - s)\u00b2\nBC\u00b2 = (r + p)\u00b2 + (s + q)\u00b2\n\nWait, because point B is (r, s) and point C is (-p, -q). So, the vector from B to C is (-p - r, -q - s). So, BC\u00b2 = (-p - r)^2 + (-q - s)^2 = (p + r)^2 + (q + s)^2.\n\nSimilarly, AB\u00b2 is (p - r)^2 + (q - s)^2.\n\nSince AB\u00b2 must equal BC\u00b2, we have:\n\n(p - r)^2 + (q - s)^2 = (p + r)^2 + (q + s)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft: p\u00b2 - 2pr + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qs + s\u00b2\nRight: p\u00b2 + 2pr + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qs + s\u00b2\n\nSubtracting right from left:\n\n(p\u00b2 - 2pr + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qs + s\u00b2) - (p\u00b2 + 2pr + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qs + s\u00b2) = 0\nSimplify:\n\n-4pr -4qs = 0\nDivide both sides by -4:\n\npr + qs = 0\n\nSo, pr + qs = 0. That's one equation.\n\nSimilarly, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. Vector AC is (p, q) + (-p, -q) = (0,0) which isn't helpful. Wait, wait, the vectors along the diagonals are AC and BD.\n\nWait, the diagonal AC is from A (p, q) to C (-p, -q), so the vector AC is (-2p, -2q). Similarly, the diagonal BD is from B (r, s) to D (-r, -s), vector BD is (-2r, -2s).\n\nWait, but in reality, the diagonals themselves are the lines connecting opposite vertices. So, the vectors AC and BD are (from A to C) and (from B to D). So, the vectors would be ( -2p, -2q ) and ( -2r, -2s ). But since the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, AC \u00b7 BD = 0.\n\nSo, (-2p)(-2r) + (-2q)(-2s) = 0\nWhich is 4pr + 4qs = 0\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\npr + qs = 0\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, from this, pr + qs = 0.\n\nNow, all four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, for point A: (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1\nSimilarly, point B: (r\u00b2)/20 - (s\u00b2)/24 = 1\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1\n2. (r\u00b2)/20 - (s\u00b2)/24 = 1\n\nAnd from the rhombus condition, pr + qs = 0.\n\nOur goal is to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nWait, BD is the diagonal BD, which is from B to D, so the length is sqrt[ (-r - r)^2 + (-s - s)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-2r)^2 + (-2s)^2 ] = sqrt[4r\u00b2 + 4s\u00b2] = 2 sqrt(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2). Therefore, BD\u00b2 is (2 sqrt(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2). So, we need to find the greatest lower bound for BD\u00b2, i.e., the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi. But the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that's the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, wait. The problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of lower bounds. So, if BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to some number from above, then that number is the infimum. So, we need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, or rather, the greatest lower bound for BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but perhaps BD\u00b2 can be as small as possible, but we're looking for the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, that number would be the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi.\n\nWait, but maybe BD\u00b2 cannot be smaller than a certain value. So, we need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, which would be the minimal value of 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2). So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 4 times the minimal (r\u00b2 + s\u00b2), given the constraints.\n\nSo, let's try to find the minimal value of (r\u00b2 + s\u00b2), given that (r\u00b2)/20 - (s\u00b2)/24 = 1 and pr + qs = 0, where (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nSince the rhombus is determined by points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, perhaps we can parametrize points A and B such that vectors OA and OB are perpendicular, and OA and OB lie on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the diagonals are the vectors AC and BD, which are ( -2p, -2q ) and ( -2r, -2s ), as before. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, (-2p)(-2r) + (-2q)(-2s) = 4pr + 4qs = 0 \u2192 pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, from this, we can write pr = -qs.\n\nSo, we have pr = -qs.\n\nSo, perhaps we can express s in terms of p, r, q: s = -(pr)/q.\n\nBut since points B (r, s) lie on the hyperbola, (r\u00b2)/20 - (s\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSo, substituting s = -(pr)/q into this equation:\n\n(r\u00b2)/20 - [ (p\u00b2 r\u00b2)/(q\u00b2) ] /24 = 1.\n\nSo, (r\u00b2)/20 - (p\u00b2 r\u00b2)/(24 q\u00b2) = 1.\n\nFactor out r\u00b2:\n\nr\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (p\u00b2)/(24 q\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nHmm, but this seems messy. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize points A and B such that vectors OA and OB are perpendicular. Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, but OA and OB are not necessarily perpendicular.\n\nWait, in the rhombus, the diagonals are AC and BD, which are perpendicular. So, vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. So, perhaps we can model this by letting AC and BD be two perpendicular vectors passing through the origin, with their midpoints at the origin.\n\nWait, but points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, so maybe we can express them in terms of angles or something.\n\nAlternatively, since the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, perhaps we can parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola such that vectors OA and OB satisfy pr + qs = 0.\n\nWait, perhaps using parametric equations for the hyperbola. For hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, parametric coordinates can be (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). So, let's use that.\n\nSo, let\u2019s denote point A as (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), where a\u00b2 = 20, so a = sqrt(20), and b\u00b2 = 24, so b = sqrt(24).\n\nThen, point A is (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, point B is (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6).\n\nNow, since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, we have that vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. But since A and C are opposite vertices, C is (-sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, -sqrt(24) tan\u03b8). Similarly, D is (-sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, -sqrt(24) tan\u03c6).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, points A and C are opposite vertices, so C is (-a sec\u03b8, -b tan\u03b8). Similarly, points B and D are (-a sec\u03c6, -b tan\u03c6).\n\nBut in the rhombus, the diagonals are AC and BD, which are vectors from A to C and from B to D. So, vectors AC and BD are (-2a sec\u03b8, -2b tan\u03b8) and (-2a sec\u03c6, -2b tan\u03c6).\n\nSince AC and BD are perpendicular, their dot product is zero:\n\n(-2a sec\u03b8)(-2a sec\u03c6) + (-2b tan\u03b8)(-2b tan\u03c6) = 0\nSo, 4a\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 4b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\na\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 = -b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6\n\nHmm, this seems a bit involved. Let me write sec\u03b8 as 1/cos\u03b8 and tan\u03b8 as sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 (1/cos\u03b8)(1/cos\u03c6) = -b\u00b2 (sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8)(sin\u03c6/cos\u03c6)\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6:\n\na\u00b2 = -b\u00b2 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\nSo,\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -a\u00b2 / b\u00b2\n\nSince a\u00b2 = 20 and b\u00b2 = 24,\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -20/24 = -5/6\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nInteresting. So, we have that relation between \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nNow, let's think about the side lengths of the rhombus. Since all sides are equal, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C, etc.\n\nWait, point A is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), point B is (a sec\u03c6, b tan\u03c6). So, the distance AB is sqrt[ (a sec\u03b8 - a sec\u03c6)^2 + (b tan\u03b8 - b tan\u03c6)^2 ].\n\nSimilarly, the distance BC would be the distance from B to C, which is (-a sec\u03b8, -b tan\u03b8). So, BC is sqrt[ (a sec\u03c6 + a sec\u03b8)^2 + (b tan\u03c6 + b tan\u03b8)^2 ].\n\nSince AB = BC, their squares should be equal.\n\nSo,\n\n(a sec\u03b8 - a sec\u03c6)^2 + (b tan\u03b8 - b tan\u03c6)^2 = (a sec\u03c6 + a sec\u03b8)^2 + (b tan\u03c6 + b tan\u03b8)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side:\n= a\u00b2 (sec\u03b8 - sec\u03c6)^2 + b\u00b2 (tan\u03b8 - tan\u03c6)^2\n= a\u00b2 (sec\u00b2\u03b8 - 2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + sec\u00b2\u03c6) + b\u00b2 (tan\u00b2\u03b8 - 2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 + tan\u00b2\u03c6)\n\nRight side:\n= a\u00b2 (sec\u03b8 + sec\u03c6)^2 + b\u00b2 (tan\u03b8 + tan\u03c6)^2\n= a\u00b2 (sec\u00b2\u03b8 + 2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + sec\u00b2\u03c6) + b\u00b2 (tan\u00b2\u03b8 + 2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 + tan\u00b2\u03c6)\n\nSubtract left from right:\n\n[ a\u00b2 (sec\u00b2\u03b8 + 2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + sec\u00b2\u03c6) + b\u00b2 (tan\u00b2\u03b8 + 2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) ]\n-\n[ a\u00b2 (sec\u00b2\u03b8 - 2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + sec\u00b2\u03c6) + b\u00b2 (tan\u00b2\u03b8 - 2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) ]\n= 0\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFor the a\u00b2 terms:\n\n(sec\u00b2\u03b8 + 2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + sec\u00b2\u03c6) - (sec\u00b2\u03b8 - 2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + sec\u00b2\u03c6)\n= 4 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6\n\nFor the b\u00b2 terms:\n\n(tan\u00b2\u03b8 + 2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) - (tan\u00b2\u03b8 - 2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 + tan\u00b2\u03c6)\n= 4 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6\n\nSo, overall:\n\n4 a\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 4 b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\na\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0\n\nWait, but we had earlier that a\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0 from the perpendicular diagonals condition. So, this is the same equation. So, the condition AB = BC is redundant because it's already satisfied by the perpendicular diagonals condition. So, perhaps we only need to consider the perpendicularity condition and the fact that points A and B lie on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, perhaps we can proceed with the earlier equation: sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2, which is 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2). Since point B is (a sec\u03c6, b tan\u03c6), so r = a sec\u03c6, s = b tan\u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nSimilarly, we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nBut we have the relation sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, perhaps we can express \u03c6 in terms of \u03b8, or vice versa, and then write BD\u00b2 as a function of \u03b8, and find its minimum.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps using the parametric equations, we can write BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nWait, let's see. From sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, we can write sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8). But we have to be careful with the domains.\n\nWait, but let's think about the hyperbola parametrization. Since the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, the parametric equations are x = a sec\u03b8, y = b tan\u03b8. So, \u03b8 is an angle, but it's not the same as the angle in the circle parametrization because of the hyperbola.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider a substitution. Let me denote t = \u03b8, then \u03c6 can be expressed in terms of t.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of sin\u03b8 and sin\u03c6, using the relation sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWait, BD\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6). Let me express this in terms of sin\u03c6 and cos\u03c6.\n\nWe know that sec\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6. But that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, express sec\u00b2\u03c6 as 1/cos\u00b2\u03c6 and tan\u00b2\u03c6 as sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 / cos\u00b2\u03c6 + b\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6)\n= 4 [ (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03c6) / cos\u00b2\u03c6 ]\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express this in terms of sin\u03c6, since we have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWait, let me consider that.\n\nWe have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWe can express cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 in terms of something else, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps we can use the identity:\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = (cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) - cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6))/2\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8 and \u03c6, and then use the condition sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6 to reduce it to a function of a single variable.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFrom BD\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nExpress sec\u00b2\u03c6 as 1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 [ a\u00b2 (1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) + b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6 ]\n= 4 [ a\u00b2 + (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) tan\u00b2\u03c6 ]\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4a\u00b2 + 4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nHmm, so BD\u00b2 is a function of \u03c6. To minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut tan\u00b2\u03c6 is non-negative, so the minimal BD\u00b2 would be when tan\u00b2\u03c6 is as small as possible.\n\nBut tan\u00b2\u03c6 can't be zero because that would imply sin\u03c6 = 0, which would make sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = 0, which contradicts sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, tan\u00b2\u03c6 has a lower bound, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find an expression for tan\u03c6 in terms of \u03b8, and then find the minimum.\n\nWait, from sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, we can write sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nThen, cos\u03c6 can be expressed as sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6) = sqrt(1 - 25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)).\n\nSo, tan\u03c6 = sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6 = [ (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8) ] / sqrt(1 - 25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)).\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write tan\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nLet me see.\n\ntan\u00b2\u03c6 = (sin\u00b2\u03c6) / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6)\n= [ (25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ] / [ 1 - (25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ]\n= [25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)] / [ (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ]\n= 25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)\n\nSo, tan\u00b2\u03c6 = 25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)\n\nSo, substituting back into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4a\u00b2 + 4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) * [25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)]\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4a\u00b2 + [4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) * 25 ] / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)\n\nLet me compute 4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) *25:\n\na\u00b2 = 20, b\u00b2 = 24, so a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 44.\n\nSo, 4*44*25 = 4*1100 = 4400.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*20 + 4400 / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)\n= 80 + 4400 / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)\n\nNow, let me denote u = sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 4400 / (36u -25)\n\nWe need to find the minimum of BD\u00b2 as a function of u.\n\nBut we must consider the possible values of u.\n\nFrom sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, and sin\u00b2\u03b8 must be such that 36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 > 0, because the denominator in tan\u00b2\u03c6 is 36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25, which must be positive to have real tan\u03c6.\n\nSo, 36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 > 0 \u2192 sin\u00b2\u03b8 > 25/36 \u2192 |sin\u03b8| > 5/6.\n\nSo, u > 25/36.\n\nSo, u \u2208 (25/36, 1].\n\nSo, our function is BD\u00b2 = 80 + 4400/(36u -25), with u \u2208 (25/36, 1].\n\nWe need to find the minimum of BD\u00b2 in this interval.\n\nLet me analyze the function f(u) = 80 + 4400/(36u -25).\n\nThe function f(u) is decreasing as u increases because the denominator increases, making the fraction decrease.\n\nSo, the minimum of f(u) occurs at the maximum u, which is u=1.\n\nSo, f(1) = 80 + 4400/(36*1 -25) = 80 + 4400/(11) = 80 + 400 = 480.\n\nWait, but that would be the minimum BD\u00b2? Wait, no, because f(u) is decreasing, so the minimal value is when u is maximum, which is u=1, giving f(u)=480.\n\nBut wait, when u approaches 25/36 from above, the denominator approaches zero, making f(u) approach infinity. So, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, but we're interested in the minimum possible BD\u00b2, which is 480.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, but wait, that can't be, because if BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be less than 480.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem is asking for the greatest lower bound. So, if BD\u00b2 can get as small as 480, then for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is at least 480. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480. But wait, no, because if BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, then the number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be up to 480, but not including 480. So, the greatest such number would be 480, but since BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, the number must be less than 480. Hmm, but this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, when u approaches 25/36 from above, the denominator 36u -25 approaches zero from above, so 4400/(36u-25) approaches +infinity. So, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWhen u approaches 1, the denominator is 36*1 -25 = 11, so 4400/11 = 400, so BD\u00b2 approaches 80 + 400 = 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, but can it be smaller? Let me see.\n\nWait, when u increases beyond 1, but u cannot be greater than 1 because sin\u00b2\u03b8 cannot exceed 1. So, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I thought BD\u00b2 was 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2), and r and s are from point B, which is (a sec\u03c6, b tan\u03c6). So, let me compute BD\u00b2 when u=1.\n\nWhen u=1, sin\u03b8=\u00b11, so \u03b8=\u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2.\n\nSo, point A would be (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). When \u03b8=\u03c0/2, sec\u03b8 is undefined, because cos\u03b8=0. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps my parametrization is causing issues here. Because when sin\u03b8=1, cos\u03b8=0, so sec\u03b8 is undefined. So, that suggests that when u approaches 1, \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, and point A approaches infinity, which isn't possible.\n\nHmm, so maybe u cannot actually reach 1. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the parametrization (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), \u03b8 cannot be \u03c0/2 because that would make sec\u03b8 undefined. So, \u03b8 is in (-\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) excluding points where cos\u03b8=0.\n\nSo, when sin\u03b8 approaches 1, \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, and sec\u03b8 approaches infinity. So, point A approaches infinity, which isn't acceptable because the rhombus would not be bounded.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is achieved when \u03b8 approaches some angle where point A is still finite, but as close as possible to the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed BD\u00b2 as 80 + 4400/(36u -25), and u approaches 1 from below, 36u -25 approaches 11, so BD\u00b2 approaches 80 + 400 = 480.\n\nBut perhaps when u approaches 25/36 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity, and when u approaches some other value, BD\u00b2 might have a minimum.\n\nWait, but I thought f(u) is decreasing as u increases. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 would be when u is as large as possible, which is approaching 1, giving BD\u00b2 approaching 480.\n\nBut since point A can't be at \u03b8=\u03c0/2, maybe the minimal BD\u00b2 is greater than 480.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me try another way.\n\nLet me consider that for the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, the asymptotes are y = \u00b1(sqrt(24)/sqrt(20))x = \u00b1(2*sqrt(6)/2*sqrt(5))x = \u00b1(sqrt(6)/sqrt(5))x \u2248 \u00b11.0954x.\n\nSo, the asymptotes are lines that the hyperbola approaches but doesn't touch.\n\nNow, in the rhombus, points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the diagonals are the lines AC and BD, which are perpendicular.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when points B and D are as close as possible to the origin, but still lying on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, but the hyperbola approaches its asymptotes, so maybe the minimal BD\u00b2 is related to the points where the line through the origin is tangent to the hyperbola.\n\nWait, because if the line y = mx passes through the origin and is tangent to the hyperbola, then the point of tangency is the closest point on the hyperbola to the origin along that line.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when points B and D lie on such a tangent line.\n\nLet me find the condition for the line y = mx to be tangent to the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nThe condition for a line y = mx + c to be tangent to the hyperbola is c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 m\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nIn our case, the line passes through the origin, so c=0. So,\n\n0 = a\u00b2 m\u00b2 - b\u00b2 \u2192 a\u00b2 m\u00b2 = b\u00b2 \u2192 m\u00b2 = b\u00b2/a\u00b2 = 24/20 = 6/5 \u2192 m = \u00b1sqrt(6/5).\n\nSo, the tangent lines are y = \u00b1sqrt(6/5)x.\n\nSo, the points of tangency can be found by solving the system:\n\ny = sqrt(6/5)x\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSubstitute y into the hyperbola equation:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - (6/5 x\u00b2)/24 = 1\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - (6 x\u00b2)/(5*24) = 1\n= x\u00b2/20 - x\u00b2/(20) = 1\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, let's compute:\n\n(6/5 x\u00b2)/24 = (6 x\u00b2)/(5*24) = (x\u00b2)/(20)\n\nSo, x\u00b2/20 - x\u00b2/20 = 0 = 1 \u2192 0=1, which is impossible. So, there must be a mistake.\n\nWait, no, the condition for the line y = mx to be tangent to the hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1 is that c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 m\u00b2 - b\u00b2. But when c=0, this would imply a\u00b2 m\u00b2 = b\u00b2, which is m\u00b2 = b\u00b2/a\u00b2.\n\nWait, but substituting back into the hyperbola equation:\n\nx\u00b2/a\u00b2 - (m\u00b2 x\u00b2)/b\u00b2 =1 \u2192 x\u00b2 (1/a\u00b2 - m\u00b2/b\u00b2) =1.\n\nBut if m\u00b2 = b\u00b2/a\u00b2, then 1/a\u00b2 - m\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1/a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2/a\u00b2)/b\u00b2 = 1/a\u00b2 - 1/a\u00b2 = 0, which gives 0 =1, which is impossible. So, the line y = mx can't be tangent to the hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1 when c=0.\n\nWait, that's strange. Maybe I made a mistake in the condition.\n\nWait, the condition for the line y = mx + c to be tangent to the hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1 is c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 m\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nSo, for the line to pass through the origin, c=0, which would require a\u00b2 m\u00b2 = b\u00b2 \u2192 m = \u00b1b/a.\n\nSo, in our case, m = \u00b1sqrt(24)/sqrt(20) = \u00b1sqrt(6/5).\n\nSo, the lines are y = \u00b1sqrt(6/5)x.\n\nBut when we substitute y = sqrt(6/5)x into the hyperbola equation, we get x\u00b2/20 - (6/5 x\u00b2)/24 = x\u00b2/20 - (6 x\u00b2)/(120) = x\u00b2/20 - x\u00b2/20 = 0 =1, which is impossible. So, that suggests that the line y = sqrt(6/5)x doesn't intersect the hyperbola, which contradicts the condition for tangency.\n\nWait, maybe the condition is different. Let me check again.\n\nThe condition for the line y = mx + c to be tangent to the hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1 is indeed c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 m\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nSo, if the line passes through the origin, c=0, so a\u00b2 m\u00b2 = b\u00b2 \u2192 m = \u00b1b/a.\n\nSo, substituting y = (b/a)x into the hyperbola equation:\n\nx\u00b2/a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2 x\u00b2)/(a\u00b2 b\u00b2) = x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - x\u00b2/a\u00b2 = 0 =1, which is impossible.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the line y = (b/a)x is an asymptote, not a tangent. Because for hyperbola, the asymptotes are y = \u00b1(b/a)x.\n\nSo, the lines y = \u00b1(b/a)x are asymptotes, and the tangent lines at points closest to the origin would have slopes different from \u00b1b/a.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the points on the hyperbola closest to the origin. The minimal distance from the origin to the hyperbola would give the minimal possible distance for points B and D, hence minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, the distance from the origin to a point (x, y) on the hyperbola is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). To minimize this, we can minimize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 subject to x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nUsing Lagrange multipliers:\n\nLet\u2019s define f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2\nSubject to g(x, y) = x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 -1 =0.\n\nThe Lagrangian is L = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - \u03bb(x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 -1).\n\nTaking partial derivatives:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202x = 2x - \u03bb(2x/20) = 0 \u2192 2x - (\u03bb x)/10 = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202y = 2y + \u03bb(2y/24) = 0 \u2192 2y + (\u03bb y)/12 = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202\u03bb = -(x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 -1) = 0\n\nFrom \u2202L/\u2202x =0:\n\n2x - (\u03bb x)/10 =0 \u2192 x(2 - \u03bb/10)=0.\n\nSo, either x=0 or \u03bb=20.\n\nIf x=0, then from the constraint equation, 0 - y\u00b2/24 =1 \u2192 y\u00b2=-24, which is impossible. So, \u03bb=20.\n\nFrom \u2202L/\u2202y=0:\n\n2y + (20 y)/12 =0 \u2192 2y + (5y/3)=0 \u2192 (6y +5y)/3=0 \u2192 11y/3=0 \u2192 y=0.\n\nIf y=0, then from the constraint equation, x\u00b2/20 =1 \u2192 x=\u00b1sqrt(20). So, points are (\u00b1sqrt(20), 0). The distance is sqrt(20 +0)=sqrt(20)=2*sqrt(5).\n\nBut wait, this is the minimal distance from the origin to the hyperbola. So, the minimal distance is 2*sqrt(5), so the minimal BD\u00b2 would be (2*2*sqrt(5))\u00b2= (4 sqrt(5))\u00b2= 16*5=80. But wait, that can't be right because earlier we found BD\u00b2=480.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the minimal distance from the origin to a point on the hyperbola is 2*sqrt(5), but BD is the distance from B to D, which are two points on the hyperbola. So, if points B and D are both at the minimal distance from the origin, which is along the x-axis at (sqrt(20),0) and (-sqrt(20),0), then BD would be the distance between (sqrt(20),0) and (-sqrt(20),0), which is 2*sqrt(20). So, BD\u00b2 would be (2*sqrt(20))\u00b2=4*20=80.\n\nBut wait, that would imply BD\u00b2=80, but earlier we had BD\u00b2=480. That suggests a conflict.\n\nWait, but in that case, the rhombus would have vertices at (sqrt(20),0), (0, y), (-sqrt(20),0), (0, -y), but that would form a rhombus with diagonals along the axes. But does that satisfy the hyperbola equation?\n\nWait, if point B is (0, y), then substituting into the hyperbola equation: 0 - y\u00b2/24=1 \u2192 y\u00b2=-24, which is impossible. So, that's not a valid point on the hyperbola. So, the minimal distance points are along the x-axis, but points B and D can't both be on the x-axis because then the other points A and C would have to be on the y-axis, which isn't possible on this hyperbola.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 isn't achieved when B and D are at minimal distance from the origin, because then the other points A and C can't form a rhombus.\n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should consider another approach.\n\nLet me go back to the earlier expression where BD\u00b2 = 80 + 4400/(36u -25), with u = sin\u00b2\u03b8, and u >25/36.\n\nWe saw that as u approaches 25/36 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity, and as u approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. But since u can't be 1, BD\u00b2 can approach 480 but can't be less than that.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that when u approaches 1, point A approaches infinity, which isn't acceptable. So, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, but that's only in the limit as u approaches 1, which isn't possible. So, perhaps BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480, but never actually reaches it.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be 480, because BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, but can't be less than 480.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of the minimal distance, I found BD\u00b2=80, but that's impossible because the points can't be on the axes.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, making the answer 480.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific values.\n\nSuppose we take \u03b8 such that sin\u03b8 = sqrt(25/36 + \u03b5), where \u03b5 is a small positive number. Then, u = sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 25/36 + \u03b5.\n\nThen, 36u -25 = 36*(25/36 + \u03b5) -25 =25 +36\u03b5 -25=36\u03b5.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =80 + 4400/(36\u03b5).\n\nAs \u03b5 approaches zero, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nOn the other hand, when u approaches 1, sin\u03b8 approaches 1, and we have:\n\nBD\u00b2=80 +4400/(36*1 -25)=80 +4400/11=80+400=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as u approaches 1.\n\nTherefore, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is 480, but since u can't actually reach 1, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 from above.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, since BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, no. Because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is greater than or equal to 480. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because BD\u00b2 can be 480 or larger. So, 480 is the infimum.\n\nThus, the answer is 480.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it out.\n\nThe hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis with length 2a, where a\u00b2 = 20, so a = sqrt(20). The conjugate axis is 2b, with b\u00b2 = 24, so b = sqrt(24).\n\nNow, the problem says that points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, and its diagonals intersect there.\n\nI know that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at 90 degrees. Wait, no, correction: In a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing with a square. Let me recall: In a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. So, yes, they are perpendicular. So, the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n\nSo, in this case, since the rhombus is centered at the origin, the diagonals intersect at the origin, and they are perpendicular. So, if one diagonal is, say, along the x-axis, the other would be along the y-axis. But since the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes, maybe the rhombus is symmetric with respect to both axes.\n\nBut wait, the hyperbola is symmetric about both the x-axis and y-axis, so if the rhombus has its diagonals along these axes, that might be a good way to model it.\n\nBut maybe the diagonals aren't necessarily aligned with the axes. Hmm, but the diagonals intersect at the origin, so they could be at any angle, but still, they need to be perpendicular.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the rhombus with its diagonals along the coordinate axes, but I'm not sure yet. Let me think.\n\nLet me consider that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, if I denote the diagonals as AC and BD, with AC and BD intersecting at the origin, then the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.\n\nSo, the coordinates of the four vertices can be written as follows: Let\u2019s say the diagonal AC has points A and C, and BD has points B and D. Since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, the coordinates of A would be (p, q), so C would be (-p, -q). Similarly, B would be (r, s), so D would be (-r, -s).\n\nBut since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, which should be equal to the distance from C to D, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to parametrize the points on the hyperbola.\n\nSince the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, any point on the hyperbola can be represented as (sqrt(20) sec \u03b8, sqrt(24) tan \u03b8), but maybe it's easier to parametrize using hyperbola functions.\n\nAlternatively, since the hyperbola is symmetric, maybe we can let the points A and C be (a, b) and (-a, -b), and points B and D be (c, d) and (-c, -d). Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to consider the vectors. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, and the rhombus is centered at the origin, perhaps the diagonals are the vectors OA and OC, and OB and OD, where OA and OC are along one diagonal, and OB and OD along the other.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are not sides, they are the lines connecting opposite vertices. So, in this case, A and C are opposite vertices connected by diagonal AC, and B and D are opposite vertices connected by diagonal BD.\n\nGiven that, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, and since the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals, the coordinates of A are (p, q), so C is (-p, -q); similarly, B is (r, s), so D is (-r, -s).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all four sides must be equal in length. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, which equals the distance between C and D, and so on.\n\nSo, the distance AB should equal BC, which should equal CD, which equals DA.\n\nLet me compute AB\u00b2 and BC\u00b2 in terms of p, q, r, s.\n\nAB\u00b2 = (p - r)\u00b2 + (q - s)\u00b2\nBC\u00b2 = (r + p)\u00b2 + (s + q)\u00b2\n\nWait, because point B is (r, s) and point C is (-p, -q). So, the vector from B to C is (-p - r, -q - s). So, BC\u00b2 = (-p - r)^2 + (-q - s)^2 = (p + r)^2 + (q + s)^2.\n\nSimilarly, AB\u00b2 is (p - r)^2 + (q - s)^2.\n\nSince AB\u00b2 must equal BC\u00b2, we have:\n\n(p - r)^2 + (q - s)^2 = (p + r)^2 + (q + s)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft: p\u00b2 - 2pr + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qs + s\u00b2\nRight: p\u00b2 + 2pr + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qs + s\u00b2\n\nSubtracting right from left:\n\n(p\u00b2 - 2pr + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qs + s\u00b2) - (p\u00b2 + 2pr + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qs + s\u00b2) = 0\nSimplify:\n\n-4pr -4qs = 0\nDivide both sides by -4:\n\npr + qs = 0\n\nSo, pr + qs = 0. That's one equation.\n\nSimilarly, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. Vector AC is (p, q) + (-p, -q) = (0,0) which isn't helpful. Wait, wait, the vectors along the diagonals are AC and BD.\n\nWait, the diagonal AC is from A (p, q) to C (-p, -q), so the vector AC is (-2p, -2q). Similarly, the diagonal BD is from B (r, s) to D (-r, -s), vector BD is (-2r, -2s).\n\nWait, but in reality, the diagonals themselves are the lines connecting opposite vertices. So, the vectors AC and BD are (from A to C) and (from B to D). So, the vectors would be ( -2p, -2q ) and ( -2r, -2s ). But since the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, AC \u00b7 BD = 0.\n\nSo, (-2p)(-2r) + (-2q)(-2s) = 0\nWhich is 4pr + 4qs = 0\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\npr + qs = 0\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, from this, pr + qs = 0.\n\nNow, all four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, for point A: (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1\nSimilarly, point B: (r\u00b2)/20 - (s\u00b2)/24 = 1\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1\n2. (r\u00b2)/20 - (s\u00b2)/24 = 1\n\nAnd from the rhombus condition, pr + qs = 0.\n\nOur goal is to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nWait, BD is the diagonal BD, which is from B to D, so the length is sqrt[ (-r - r)^2 + (-s - s)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-2r)^2 + (-2s)^2 ] = sqrt[4r\u00b2 + 4s\u00b2] = 2 sqrt(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2). Therefore, BD\u00b2 is (2 sqrt(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2). So, we need to find the greatest lower bound for BD\u00b2, i.e., the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi. But the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that's the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, wait. The problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of lower bounds. So, if BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to some number from above, then that number is the infimum. So, we need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, or rather, the greatest lower bound for BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but perhaps BD\u00b2 can be as small as possible, but we're looking for the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, that number would be the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi.\n\nWait, but maybe BD\u00b2 cannot be smaller than a certain value. So, we need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, which would be the minimal value of 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2). So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 4 times the minimal (r\u00b2 + s\u00b2), given the constraints.\n\nSo, let's try to find the minimal value of (r\u00b2 + s\u00b2), given that (r\u00b2)/20 - (s\u00b2)/24 = 1 and pr + qs = 0, where (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nSince the rhombus is determined by points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, perhaps we can parametrize points A and B such that vectors OA and OB are perpendicular, and OA and OB lie on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the diagonals are the vectors AC and BD, which are ( -2p, -2q ) and ( -2r, -2s ), as before. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, (-2p)(-2r) + (-2q)(-2s) = 4pr + 4qs = 0 \u2192 pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, from this, we can write pr = -qs.\n\nSo, we have pr = -qs.\n\nSo, perhaps we can express s in terms of p, r, q: s = -(pr)/q.\n\nBut since points B (r, s) lie on the hyperbola, (r\u00b2)/20 - (s\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSo, substituting s = -(pr)/q into this equation:\n\n(r\u00b2)/20 - [ (p\u00b2 r\u00b2)/(q\u00b2) ] /24 = 1.\n\nSo, (r\u00b2)/20 - (p\u00b2 r\u00b2)/(24 q\u00b2) = 1.\n\nFactor out r\u00b2:\n\nr\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (p\u00b2)/(24 q\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nHmm, but this seems messy. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize points A and B such that vectors OA and OB are perpendicular. Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, but OA and OB are not necessarily perpendicular.\n\nWait, in the rhombus, the diagonals are AC and BD, which are perpendicular. So, vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. So, perhaps we can model this by letting AC and BD be two perpendicular vectors passing through the origin, with their midpoints at the origin.\n\nWait, but points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, so maybe we can express them in terms of angles or something.\n\nAlternatively, since the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, perhaps we can parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola such that vectors OA and OB satisfy pr + qs = 0.\n\nWait, perhaps using parametric equations for the hyperbola. For hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, parametric coordinates can be (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). So, let's use that.\n\nSo, let\u2019s denote point A as (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), where a\u00b2 = 20, so a = sqrt(20), and b\u00b2 = 24, so b = sqrt(24).\n\nThen, point A is (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, point B is (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6).\n\nNow, since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, we have that vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. But since A and C are opposite vertices, C is (-sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, -sqrt(24) tan\u03b8). Similarly, D is (-sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, -sqrt(24) tan\u03c6).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, points A and C are opposite vertices, so C is (-a sec\u03b8, -b tan\u03b8). Similarly, points B and D are (-a sec\u03c6, -b tan\u03c6).\n\nBut in the rhombus, the diagonals are AC and BD, which are vectors from A to C and from B to D. So, vectors AC and BD are (-2a sec\u03b8, -2b tan\u03b8) and (-2a sec\u03c6, -2b tan\u03c6).\n\nSince AC and BD are perpendicular, their dot product is zero:\n\n(-2a sec\u03b8)(-2a sec\u03c6) + (-2b tan\u03b8)(-2b tan\u03c6) = 0\nSo, 4a\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 4b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\na\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 = -b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6\n\nHmm, this seems a bit involved. Let me write sec\u03b8 as 1/cos\u03b8 and tan\u03b8 as sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 (1/cos\u03b8)(1/cos\u03c6) = -b\u00b2 (sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8)(sin\u03c6/cos\u03c6)\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6:\n\na\u00b2 = -b\u00b2 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\nSo,\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -a\u00b2 / b\u00b2\n\nSince a\u00b2 = 20 and b\u00b2 = 24,\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -20/24 = -5/6\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nInteresting. So, we have that relation between \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nNow, let's think about the side lengths of the rhombus. Since all sides are equal, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C, etc.\n\nWait, point A is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), point B is (a sec\u03c6, b tan\u03c6). So, the distance AB is sqrt[ (a sec\u03b8 - a sec\u03c6)^2 + (b tan\u03b8 - b tan\u03c6)^2 ].\n\nSimilarly, the distance BC would be the distance from B to C, which is (-a sec\u03b8, -b tan\u03b8). So, BC is sqrt[ (a sec\u03c6 + a sec\u03b8)^2 + (b tan\u03c6 + b tan\u03b8)^2 ].\n\nSince AB = BC, their squares should be equal.\n\nSo,\n\n(a sec\u03b8 - a sec\u03c6)^2 + (b tan\u03b8 - b tan\u03c6)^2 = (a sec\u03c6 + a sec\u03b8)^2 + (b tan\u03c6 + b tan\u03b8)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side:\n= a\u00b2 (sec\u03b8 - sec\u03c6)^2 + b\u00b2 (tan\u03b8 - tan\u03c6)^2\n= a\u00b2 (sec\u00b2\u03b8 - 2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + sec\u00b2\u03c6) + b\u00b2 (tan\u00b2\u03b8 - 2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 + tan\u00b2\u03c6)\n\nRight side:\n= a\u00b2 (sec\u03b8 + sec\u03c6)^2 + b\u00b2 (tan\u03b8 + tan\u03c6)^2\n= a\u00b2 (sec\u00b2\u03b8 + 2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + sec\u00b2\u03c6) + b\u00b2 (tan\u00b2\u03b8 + 2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 + tan\u00b2\u03c6)\n\nSubtract left from right:\n\n[ a\u00b2 (sec\u00b2\u03b8 + 2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + sec\u00b2\u03c6) + b\u00b2 (tan\u00b2\u03b8 + 2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) ]\n-\n[ a\u00b2 (sec\u00b2\u03b8 - 2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + sec\u00b2\u03c6) + b\u00b2 (tan\u00b2\u03b8 - 2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) ]\n= 0\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFor the a\u00b2 terms:\n\n(sec\u00b2\u03b8 + 2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + sec\u00b2\u03c6) - (sec\u00b2\u03b8 - 2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + sec\u00b2\u03c6)\n= 4 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6\n\nFor the b\u00b2 terms:\n\n(tan\u00b2\u03b8 + 2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) - (tan\u00b2\u03b8 - 2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 + tan\u00b2\u03c6)\n= 4 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6\n\nSo, overall:\n\n4 a\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 4 b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\na\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0\n\nWait, but we had earlier that a\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0 from the perpendicular diagonals condition. So, this is the same equation. So, the condition AB = BC is redundant because it's already satisfied by the perpendicular diagonals condition. So, perhaps we only need to consider the perpendicularity condition and the fact that points A and B lie on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, perhaps we can proceed with the earlier equation: sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2, which is 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2). Since point B is (a sec\u03c6, b tan\u03c6), so r = a sec\u03c6, s = b tan\u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nSimilarly, we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nBut we have the relation sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, perhaps we can express \u03c6 in terms of \u03b8, or vice versa, and then write BD\u00b2 as a function of \u03b8, and find its minimum.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps using the parametric equations, we can write BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nWait, let's see. From sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, we can write sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8). But we have to be careful with the domains.\n\nWait, but let's think about the hyperbola parametrization. Since the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, the parametric equations are x = a sec\u03b8, y = b tan\u03b8. So, \u03b8 is an angle, but it's not the same as the angle in the circle parametrization because of the hyperbola.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider a substitution. Let me denote t = \u03b8, then \u03c6 can be expressed in terms of t.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of sin\u03b8 and sin\u03c6, using the relation sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWait, BD\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6). Let me express this in terms of sin\u03c6 and cos\u03c6.\n\nWe know that sec\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6. But that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, express sec\u00b2\u03c6 as 1/cos\u00b2\u03c6 and tan\u00b2\u03c6 as sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 / cos\u00b2\u03c6 + b\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6)\n= 4 [ (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03c6) / cos\u00b2\u03c6 ]\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express this in terms of sin\u03c6, since we have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWait, let me consider that.\n\nWe have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWe can express cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 in terms of something else, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps we can use the identity:\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = (cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) - cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6))/2\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8 and \u03c6, and then use the condition sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6 to reduce it to a function of a single variable.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFrom BD\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nExpress sec\u00b2\u03c6 as 1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 [ a\u00b2 (1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) + b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6 ]\n= 4 [ a\u00b2 + (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) tan\u00b2\u03c6 ]\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4a\u00b2 + 4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nHmm, so BD\u00b2 is a function of \u03c6. To minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut tan\u00b2\u03c6 is non-negative, so the minimal BD\u00b2 would be when tan\u00b2\u03c6 is as small as possible.\n\nBut tan\u00b2\u03c6 can't be zero because that would imply sin\u03c6 = 0, which would make sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = 0, which contradicts sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, tan\u00b2\u03c6 has a lower bound, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find an expression for tan\u03c6 in terms of \u03b8, and then find the minimum.\n\nWait, from sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, we can write sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nThen, cos\u03c6 can be expressed as sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6) = sqrt(1 - 25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)).\n\nSo, tan\u03c6 = sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6 = [ (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8) ] / sqrt(1 - 25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)).\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write tan\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nLet me see.\n\ntan\u00b2\u03c6 = (sin\u00b2\u03c6) / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6)\n= [ (25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ] / [ 1 - (25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ]\n= [25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)] / [ (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ]\n= 25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)\n\nSo, tan\u00b2\u03c6 = 25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)\n\nSo, substituting back into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4a\u00b2 + 4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) * [25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)]\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4a\u00b2 + [4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) * 25 ] / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)\n\nLet me compute 4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) *25:\n\na\u00b2 = 20, b\u00b2 = 24, so a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 44.\n\nSo, 4*44*25 = 4*1100 = 4400.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*20 + 4400 / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)\n= 80 + 4400 / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)\n\nNow, let me denote u = sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 4400 / (36u -25)\n\nWe need to find the minimum of BD\u00b2 as a function of u.\n\nBut we must consider the possible values of u.\n\nFrom sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, and sin\u00b2\u03b8 must be such that 36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 > 0, because the denominator in tan\u00b2\u03c6 is 36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25, which must be positive to have real tan\u03c6.\n\nSo, 36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 > 0 \u2192 sin\u00b2\u03b8 > 25/36 \u2192 |sin\u03b8| > 5/6.\n\nSo, u > 25/36.\n\nSo, u \u2208 (25/36, 1].\n\nSo, our function is BD\u00b2 = 80 + 4400/(36u -25), with u \u2208 (25/36, 1].\n\nWe need to find the minimum of BD\u00b2 in this interval.\n\nLet me analyze the function f(u) = 80 + 4400/(36u -25).\n\nThe function f(u) is decreasing as u increases because the denominator increases, making the fraction decrease.\n\nSo, the minimum of f(u) occurs at the maximum u, which is u=1.\n\nSo, f(1) = 80 + 4400/(36*1 -25) = 80 + 4400/(11) = 80 + 400 = 480.\n\nWait, but that would be the minimum BD\u00b2? Wait, no, because f(u) is decreasing, so the minimal value is when u is maximum, which is u=1, giving f(u)=480.\n\nBut wait, when u approaches 25/36 from above, the denominator approaches zero, making f(u) approach infinity. So, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, but we're interested in the minimum possible BD\u00b2, which is 480.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, but wait, that can't be, because if BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be less than 480.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem is asking for the greatest lower bound. So, if BD\u00b2 can get as small as 480, then for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is at least 480. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480. But wait, no, because if BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, then the number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be up to 480, but not including 480. So, the greatest such number would be 480, but since BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, the number must be less than 480. Hmm, but this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, when u approaches 25/36 from above, the denominator 36u -25 approaches zero from above, so 4400/(36u-25) approaches +infinity. So, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWhen u approaches 1, the denominator is 36*1 -25 = 11, so 4400/11 = 400, so BD\u00b2 approaches 80 + 400 = 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, but can it be smaller? Let me see.\n\nWait, when u increases beyond 1, but u cannot be greater than 1 because sin\u00b2\u03b8 cannot exceed 1. So, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I thought BD\u00b2 was 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2), and r and s are from point B, which is (a sec\u03c6, b tan\u03c6). So, let me compute BD\u00b2 when u=1.\n\nWhen u=1, sin\u03b8=\u00b11, so \u03b8=\u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2.\n\nSo, point A would be (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). When \u03b8=\u03c0/2, sec\u03b8 is undefined, because cos\u03b8=0. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps my parametrization is causing issues here. Because when sin\u03b8=1, cos\u03b8=0, so sec\u03b8 is undefined. So, that suggests that when u approaches 1, \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, and point A approaches infinity, which isn't possible.\n\nHmm, so maybe u cannot actually reach 1. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the parametrization (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), \u03b8 cannot be \u03c0/2 because that would make sec\u03b8 undefined. So, \u03b8 is in (-\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) excluding points where cos\u03b8=0.\n\nSo, when sin\u03b8 approaches 1, \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, and sec\u03b8 approaches infinity. So, point A approaches infinity, which isn't acceptable because the rhombus would not be bounded.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is achieved when \u03b8 approaches some angle where point A is still finite, but as close as possible to the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed BD\u00b2 as 80 + 4400/(36u -25), and u approaches 1 from below, 36u -25 approaches 11, so BD\u00b2 approaches 80 + 400 = 480.\n\nBut perhaps when u approaches 25/36 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity, and when u approaches some other value, BD\u00b2 might have a minimum.\n\nWait, but I thought f(u) is decreasing as u increases. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 would be when u is as large as possible, which is approaching 1, giving BD\u00b2 approaching 480.\n\nBut since point A can't be at \u03b8=\u03c0/2, maybe the minimal BD\u00b2 is greater than 480.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me try another way.\n\nLet me consider that for the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, the asymptotes are y = \u00b1(sqrt(24)/sqrt(20))x = \u00b1(2*sqrt(6)/2*sqrt(5))x = \u00b1(sqrt(6)/sqrt(5))x \u2248 \u00b11.0954x.\n\nSo, the asymptotes are lines that the hyperbola approaches but doesn't touch.\n\nNow, in the rhombus, points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the diagonals are the lines AC and BD, which are perpendicular.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when points B and D are as close as possible to the origin, but still lying on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, but the hyperbola approaches its asymptotes, so maybe the minimal BD\u00b2 is related to the points where the line through the origin is tangent to the hyperbola.\n\nWait, because if the line y = mx passes through the origin and is tangent to the hyperbola, then the point of tangency is the closest point on the hyperbola to the origin along that line.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when points B and D lie on such a tangent line.\n\nLet me find the condition for the line y = mx to be tangent to the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nThe condition for a line y = mx + c to be tangent to the hyperbola is c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 m\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nIn our case, the line passes through the origin, so c=0. So,\n\n0 = a\u00b2 m\u00b2 - b\u00b2 \u2192 a\u00b2 m\u00b2 = b\u00b2 \u2192 m\u00b2 = b\u00b2/a\u00b2 = 24/20 = 6/5 \u2192 m = \u00b1sqrt(6/5).\n\nSo, the tangent lines are y = \u00b1sqrt(6/5)x.\n\nSo, the points of tangency can be found by solving the system:\n\ny = sqrt(6/5)x\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSubstitute y into the hyperbola equation:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - (6/5 x\u00b2)/24 = 1\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - (6 x\u00b2)/(5*24) = 1\n= x\u00b2/20 - x\u00b2/(20) = 1\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, let's compute:\n\n(6/5 x\u00b2)/24 = (6 x\u00b2)/(5*24) = (x\u00b2)/(20)\n\nSo, x\u00b2/20 - x\u00b2/20 = 0 = 1 \u2192 0=1, which is impossible. So, there must be a mistake.\n\nWait, no, the condition for the line y = mx to be tangent to the hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1 is that c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 m\u00b2 - b\u00b2. But when c=0, this would imply a\u00b2 m\u00b2 = b\u00b2, which is m\u00b2 = b\u00b2/a\u00b2.\n\nWait, but substituting back into the hyperbola equation:\n\nx\u00b2/a\u00b2 - (m\u00b2 x\u00b2)/b\u00b2 =1 \u2192 x\u00b2 (1/a\u00b2 - m\u00b2/b\u00b2) =1.\n\nBut if m\u00b2 = b\u00b2/a\u00b2, then 1/a\u00b2 - m\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1/a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2/a\u00b2)/b\u00b2 = 1/a\u00b2 - 1/a\u00b2 = 0, which gives 0 =1, which is impossible. So, the line y = mx can't be tangent to the hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1 when c=0.\n\nWait, that's strange. Maybe I made a mistake in the condition.\n\nWait, the condition for the line y = mx + c to be tangent to the hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1 is c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 m\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nSo, for the line to pass through the origin, c=0, which would require a\u00b2 m\u00b2 = b\u00b2 \u2192 m = \u00b1b/a.\n\nSo, in our case, m = \u00b1sqrt(24)/sqrt(20) = \u00b1sqrt(6/5).\n\nSo, the lines are y = \u00b1sqrt(6/5)x.\n\nBut when we substitute y = sqrt(6/5)x into the hyperbola equation, we get x\u00b2/20 - (6/5 x\u00b2)/24 = x\u00b2/20 - (6 x\u00b2)/(120) = x\u00b2/20 - x\u00b2/20 = 0 =1, which is impossible. So, that suggests that the line y = sqrt(6/5)x doesn't intersect the hyperbola, which contradicts the condition for tangency.\n\nWait, maybe the condition is different. Let me check again.\n\nThe condition for the line y = mx + c to be tangent to the hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1 is indeed c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 m\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nSo, if the line passes through the origin, c=0, so a\u00b2 m\u00b2 = b\u00b2 \u2192 m = \u00b1b/a.\n\nSo, substituting y = (b/a)x into the hyperbola equation:\n\nx\u00b2/a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2 x\u00b2)/(a\u00b2 b\u00b2) = x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - x\u00b2/a\u00b2 = 0 =1, which is impossible.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the line y = (b/a)x is an asymptote, not a tangent. Because for hyperbola, the asymptotes are y = \u00b1(b/a)x.\n\nSo, the lines y = \u00b1(b/a)x are asymptotes, and the tangent lines at points closest to the origin would have slopes different from \u00b1b/a.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the points on the hyperbola closest to the origin. The minimal distance from the origin to the hyperbola would give the minimal possible distance for points B and D, hence minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, the distance from the origin to a point (x, y) on the hyperbola is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). To minimize this, we can minimize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 subject to x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nUsing Lagrange multipliers:\n\nLet\u2019s define f(x, y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2\nSubject to g(x, y) = x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 -1 =0.\n\nThe Lagrangian is L = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - \u03bb(x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 -1).\n\nTaking partial derivatives:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202x = 2x - \u03bb(2x/20) = 0 \u2192 2x - (\u03bb x)/10 = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202y = 2y + \u03bb(2y/24) = 0 \u2192 2y + (\u03bb y)/12 = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202\u03bb = -(x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 -1) = 0\n\nFrom \u2202L/\u2202x =0:\n\n2x - (\u03bb x)/10 =0 \u2192 x(2 - \u03bb/10)=0.\n\nSo, either x=0 or \u03bb=20.\n\nIf x=0, then from the constraint equation, 0 - y\u00b2/24 =1 \u2192 y\u00b2=-24, which is impossible. So, \u03bb=20.\n\nFrom \u2202L/\u2202y=0:\n\n2y + (20 y)/12 =0 \u2192 2y + (5y/3)=0 \u2192 (6y +5y)/3=0 \u2192 11y/3=0 \u2192 y=0.\n\nIf y=0, then from the constraint equation, x\u00b2/20 =1 \u2192 x=\u00b1sqrt(20). So, points are (\u00b1sqrt(20), 0). The distance is sqrt(20 +0)=sqrt(20)=2*sqrt(5).\n\nBut wait, this is the minimal distance from the origin to the hyperbola. So, the minimal distance is 2*sqrt(5), so the minimal BD\u00b2 would be (2*2*sqrt(5))\u00b2= (4 sqrt(5))\u00b2= 16*5=80. But wait, that can't be right because earlier we found BD\u00b2=480.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the minimal distance from the origin to a point on the hyperbola is 2*sqrt(5), but BD is the distance from B to D, which are two points on the hyperbola. So, if points B and D are both at the minimal distance from the origin, which is along the x-axis at (sqrt(20),0) and (-sqrt(20),0), then BD would be the distance between (sqrt(20),0) and (-sqrt(20),0), which is 2*sqrt(20). So, BD\u00b2 would be (2*sqrt(20))\u00b2=4*20=80.\n\nBut wait, that would imply BD\u00b2=80, but earlier we had BD\u00b2=480. That suggests a conflict.\n\nWait, but in that case, the rhombus would have vertices at (sqrt(20),0), (0, y), (-sqrt(20),0), (0, -y), but that would form a rhombus with diagonals along the axes. But does that satisfy the hyperbola equation?\n\nWait, if point B is (0, y), then substituting into the hyperbola equation: 0 - y\u00b2/24=1 \u2192 y\u00b2=-24, which is impossible. So, that's not a valid point on the hyperbola. So, the minimal distance points are along the x-axis, but points B and D can't both be on the x-axis because then the other points A and C would have to be on the y-axis, which isn't possible on this hyperbola.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 isn't achieved when B and D are at minimal distance from the origin, because then the other points A and C can't form a rhombus.\n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should consider another approach.\n\nLet me go back to the earlier expression where BD\u00b2 = 80 + 4400/(36u -25), with u = sin\u00b2\u03b8, and u >25/36.\n\nWe saw that as u approaches 25/36 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity, and as u approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. But since u can't be 1, BD\u00b2 can approach 480 but can't be less than that.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that when u approaches 1, point A approaches infinity, which isn't acceptable. So, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, but that's only in the limit as u approaches 1, which isn't possible. So, perhaps BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480, but never actually reaches it.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be 480, because BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, but can't be less than 480.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of the minimal distance, I found BD\u00b2=80, but that's impossible because the points can't be on the axes.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, making the answer 480.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific values.\n\nSuppose we take \u03b8 such that sin\u03b8 = sqrt(25/36 + \u03b5), where \u03b5 is a small positive number. Then, u = sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 25/36 + \u03b5.\n\nThen, 36u -25 = 36*(25/36 + \u03b5) -25 =25 +36\u03b5 -25=36\u03b5.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =80 + 4400/(36\u03b5).\n\nAs \u03b5 approaches zero, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nOn the other hand, when u approaches 1, sin\u03b8 approaches 1, and we have:\n\nBD\u00b2=80 +4400/(36*1 -25)=80 +4400/11=80+400=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as u approaches 1.\n\nTherefore, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is 480, but since u can't actually reach 1, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 from above.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, since BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, no. Because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is greater than or equal to 480. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because BD\u00b2 can be 480 or larger. So, 480 is the infimum.\n\nThus, the answer is 480.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all rhombi \\( ABCD \\) inscribed in the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin.\n\n1. **Hyperbola and Rhombus Properties**:\n   - The hyperbola is centered at the origin, opening along the x-axis.\n   - The rhombus \\( ABCD \\) has its diagonals intersecting at the origin and is symmetric about both axes.\n\n2. **Parametrization of Points**:\n   - Points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) on the hyperbola can be parametrized as \\( (a \\sec\\theta, b \\tan\\theta) \\) and \\( (a \\sec\\phi, b \\tan\\phi) \\), respectively, where \\( a = \\sqrt{20} \\) and \\( b = \\sqrt{24} \\).\n\n3. **Perpendicular Diagonals**:\n   - The diagonals \\( AC \\) and \\( BD \\) are perpendicular, leading to the condition \\( \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = -\\frac{5}{6} \\).\n\n4. **Expression for \\( BD^2 \\)**:\n   - \\( BD^2 = 4(a^2 \\sec^2\\phi + b^2 \\tan^2\\phi) \\).\n   - Substituting \\( a^2 = 20 \\) and \\( b^2 = 24 \\), we find \\( BD^2 = 80 + \\frac{4400}{36\\sin^2\\theta - 25} \\).\n\n5. **Minimizing \\( BD^2 \\)**:\n   - The function \\( BD^2 \\) is minimized when \\( \\sin^2\\theta \\) approaches 1, leading to \\( BD^2 \\) approaching 480.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The minimal value of \\( BD^2 \\) is 480, and since \\( BD^2 \\) cannot be less than this value for any such rhombus, the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all rhombi is **480**.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{480}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand what's being asked. \n\nThe hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. That's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right because the positive term is with x\u00b2. The transverse axis length is 2a, where a\u00b2=20, so a=2\u221a5. The conjugate axis is 2b, with b\u00b2=24, so b=2\u221a6.\n\nNow, the problem mentions points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, and its diagonals are along the coordinate axes? Or maybe not necessarily, but their intersection is at the origin.\n\nWait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, but I'm not sure if they have to be along the axes. Hmm. But the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes and the origin. So, if the rhombus is centered at the origin, maybe the diagonals are along the axes? That would make sense because of the symmetry.\n\nWait, no, not necessarily. The diagonals could be at some angle, but their intersection is at the origin. So, the rhombus is such that the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if I consider points A and C as endpoints of one diagonal, then B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal, and the midpoints of both diagonals are at the origin.\n\nSo, for a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Therefore, if A is (x,y), then C must be (-x,-y) because the midpoint is the origin. Similarly, if B is (p,q), then D is (-p,-q). \n\nBut wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily the axes, but in this case, since the rhombus is on a hyperbola, the points are arranged such that A and C are opposite vertices, B and D are the other pair.\n\nWait, but the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola. So, each of these points must satisfy the equation.\n\nSo, let's say points A and C are (x, y) and (-x, -y). Then, points B and D are (p, q) and (-p, -q). All four points must lie on the hyperbola.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the lengths AB, BC, CD, DA are equal.\n\nAlternatively, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, if the diagonals are AC and BD, then vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular.\n\nWait, but since diagonals bisect each other at the origin, and since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, if AC is the vector from (x,y) to (-x,-y), which is (-2x, -2y), and BD is from (p,q) to (-p,-q), which is (-2p, -2q). For these vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero.\n\nSo, (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0 => 4xp + 4yq = 0 => xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, that's one condition: xp + yq = 0.\n\nAdditionally, all four points A(x,y), B(p,q), C(-x,-y), D(-p,-q) lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, each point must satisfy:\n\nFor A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nFor B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly for C and D, but since they are just negatives, they will satisfy the same equations.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\n2. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAnd the condition from the diagonals being perpendicular: xp + yq = 0.\n\nAlso, since it's a rhombus, the sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C, etc.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use vectors or parametric equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the points on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, hyperbola parametrization can be done using hyperbolic functions. For the hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a parametrization is (a cosh \u03b8, b sinh \u03b8). But since hyperbola has two branches, and our rhombus is made of four points, perhaps they are on different branches.\n\nWait, but in our hyperbola, the points A and C are on opposite ends. So, if A is on one branch, C is on the other branch because it's (-x, -y). Similarly, B and D are on the other pair of branches. Wait, actually, no. The hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 has two branches, left and right, symmetric with respect to both axes.\n\nWait, but a rhombus is a convex quadrilateral, so all four points can't be on the same branch. Because if all points are on the same branch, the figure would not be convex. So, two points on one branch and two on the other. But given the hyperbola's symmetry, I think points A and C are on opposite branches, and B and D are on opposite branches as well.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, which has two branches on the left and right. So, points A and C are on opposite branches, as their coordinates are (x,y) and (-x,-y). Similarly, B and D are on opposite branches, (p,q) and (-p,-q).\n\nSo, all four points are on the hyperbola, with two on the right branch and two on the left branch.\n\nWait, but for a rhombus, the points should be arranged such that moving from A to B to C to D, each consecutive point is a vertex of the rhombus.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of vectors.\n\nLet me denote vectors OA, OB, OC, OD as vectors from the origin to points A, B, C, D respectively. Since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides are equal, so vectors AB, BC, CD, DA should have the same magnitude.\n\nAlternatively, in a rhombus, the adjacent sides are equal and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.\n\nWait, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the vectors OA and OC are negatives of each other, same with OB and OD.\n\nSo, in that case, the diagonals are AC and BD, which are vectors from A to C and from B to D.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. So, as I mentioned before, OA \u00b7 OB = 0? Wait, no, wait. The diagonals are AC and BD.\n\nSo, vector AC is C - A = (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y).\n\nVector BD is D - B = (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q).\n\nSo, their dot product is (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 4xp + 4yq = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, that's our condition.\n\nNow, we have points A(x,y), B(p,q), C(-x,-y), D(-p,-q) on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 and p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAlso, xp + yq = 0.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2.\n\nBD is the length of the diagonal BD. Since B is (p,q) and D is (-p,-q), the distance between B and D is sqrt[( -p - p )\u00b2 + ( -q - q )\u00b2] = sqrt[(-2p)\u00b2 + (-2q)^2] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2] = 2 sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is (2 sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nOur goal is to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the supremum of BD\u00b2, which is the least upper bound.\n\nSo, we need to maximize BD\u00b2, i.e., maximize 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), given the constraints.\n\nBut wait, let's see. We have two hyperbola equations:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nand xp + yq = 0.\n\nWe can perhaps express variables in terms of each other.\n\nLet me consider variables x, y, p, q.\n\nWe have xp + yq = 0.\n\nLet me express, say, q in terms of p: q = (-xp)/y.\n\nSubstituting into the second hyperbola equation:\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2/20 - ( (x\u00b2 p\u00b2) / (y\u00b2 * 24) ) = 1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 [1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nHmm. Now, from the first hyperbola equation, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nLet me rearrange that: x\u00b2/20 = 1 + y\u00b2/24.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20(1 + y\u00b2/24) = 20 + (20 y\u00b2)/24 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2/(20) = 1 + y\u00b2/(24), which is consistent.\n\nSo, going back to the expression for p\u00b2.\n\nWe have p\u00b2 [1/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nSubstituting x\u00b2 from above:\n\np\u00b2 [1/20 - (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / (24 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nLet me compute the term inside the brackets:\n\n1/20 - [ (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / (24 y\u00b2) ].\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\n20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 = (120 + 5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, dividing by 24 y\u00b2 gives:\n\n(120 + 5 y\u00b2)/(6 * 24 y\u00b2) = (120 + 5 y\u00b2)/(144 y\u00b2) = [5(24 + y\u00b2)]/(144 y\u00b2) = (5)(24 + y\u00b2)/(144 y\u00b2).\n\nSo, the term inside the brackets is:\n\n1/20 - [5(24 + y\u00b2)]/(144 y\u00b2).\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nConvert 1/20 to a denominator of 144 y\u00b2:\n\n1/20 = (7.2 y\u00b2)/144 y\u00b2. Wait, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, let's find a common denominator.\n\nLet me write both terms with denominator 144 y\u00b2 * 20.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute numerically.\n\nWait, 1/20 = 0.05, and the other term is 5(24 + y\u00b2)/(144 y\u00b2).\n\nWait, maybe we can factor 5:\n\n= 5(24 + y\u00b2)/(144 y\u00b2) = 5/(144 y\u00b2) * (24 + y\u00b2).\n\nBut perhaps it's better to compute it as:\n\n= [ (144 y\u00b2) * 1/20 - 5(24 + y\u00b2) ] / (144 y\u00b2).\n\nWait, no, that's not the case. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recast the expression.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 [1/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nWe have x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) = [20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6]/(24 y\u00b2) = 20/(24 y\u00b2) + (5 y\u00b2)/(6 *24 y\u00b2) = (5)/(6 y\u00b2) + 5/(144).\n\nWait, let me compute each term:\n\n20/(24 y\u00b2) = (5)/(6 y\u00b2).\n\n(5 y\u00b2)/(6 *24 y\u00b2) = 5/(6*24) = 5/(144).\n\nSo, x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) = 5/(6 y\u00b2) + 5/144.\n\nSo, 1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) = 1/20 - [5/(6 y\u00b2) + 5/144] = 1/20 - 5/(6 y\u00b2) -5/144.\n\nCombine the constants:\n\n1/20 - 5/144 = (144 - 100)/2880 = 44/2880 = 11/720.\n\nSo, 1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) = 11/720 - 5/(6 y\u00b2).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 [11/720 - 5/(6 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 1 / [11/720 - 5/(6 y\u00b2) ].\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of x and y.\n\nSince BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), and from the hyperbola equation for point B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, from this equation, we can express p\u00b2 = 20(1 + q\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 [20(1 + q\u00b2/24) + q\u00b2] = 4 [20 + (20 q\u00b2)/24 + q\u00b2] = 4 [20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6 + q\u00b2] = 4 [20 + (11 q\u00b2)/6 ].\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(20) + 4*(11 q\u00b2)/6 = 80 + (22 q\u00b2)/3.\n\nHmm, but then we need to relate q\u00b2 with x and y.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express q in terms of p, using xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, q = - (xp)/y.\n\nThen, from point B's hyperbola equation: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSubstituting q = -xp/y:\n\np\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(y\u00b2 *24) =1.\n\nFactor p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 1 / [1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) ].\n\nWhich is similar to what I had earlier.\n\nBut from point A's hyperbola equation: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, substituting x\u00b2 into p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 = 1 / [1/20 - (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 )/(24 y\u00b2) ].\n\nLet me compute the denominator:\n\n1/20 - [ (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / (24 y\u00b2) ].\n\nCompute the second term:\n\n(20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / (24 y\u00b2) = 20/(24 y\u00b2) + (5 y\u00b2)/(6 *24 y\u00b2) = (5)/(6 y\u00b2) + 5/(144).\n\nSo, denominator becomes:\n\n1/20 - 5/(6 y\u00b2) -5/144.\n\nCombine constants:\n\n1/20 -5/144 = (144 - 100)/2880 = 44/2880 = 11/720.\n\nSo, denominator is 11/720 -5/(6 y\u00b2).\n\nThus, p\u00b2 = 1 / [11/720 -5/(6 y\u00b2) ].\n\nLet me write this as:\n\np\u00b2 = 1 / [ (11 - 60 y\u00b2/720 ) / 720 ].\n\nWait, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, let me factor out 1/720:\n\nDenominator: 11/720 -5/(6 y\u00b2) = [11 - 60/(720 y\u00b2) *5 ]? Wait, perhaps better to write as:\n\n= (11)/(720) - (5)/(6 y\u00b2) = (11)/(720) - (5 * 120)/(720 y\u00b2) ) = [11 - (600)/(y\u00b2)] /720.\n\nWait, 5/(6 y\u00b2) = (5 * 120)/(720 y\u00b2) = 600/(720 y\u00b2). Wait, 5/(6 y\u00b2) = (5 * 120)/(720 y\u00b2) because 6*120=720. So, 5/(6 y\u00b2) = (600)/(720 y\u00b2). So, denominator becomes [11 - (600)/(y\u00b2)] /720.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 1 / [ (11 - 600/y\u00b2)/720 ] = 720 / (11 - 600/y\u00b2).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 720 / (11 - 600/y\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nBut q = -xp/y, so q\u00b2 = x\u00b2 p\u00b2 / y\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + x\u00b2 p\u00b2 / y\u00b2 ) = 4 p\u00b2 (1 + x\u00b2 / y\u00b2 ).\n\nSubstituting p\u00b2 from above:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * [720 / (11 - 600/y\u00b2) ] * [1 + x\u00b2 / y\u00b2 ].\n\nBut x\u00b2 =20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6, so x\u00b2 / y\u00b2 = 20/y\u00b2 + 5/6.\n\nSo, 1 + x\u00b2 / y\u00b2 = 1 + 20/y\u00b2 +5/6 = (6 + 120/y\u00b2 +5)/6 = (11 + 120/y\u00b2)/6.\n\nWait, let me compute 1 + x\u00b2/y\u00b2:\n\n1 + x\u00b2/y\u00b2 = 1 + (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / y\u00b2 = 1 + 20/y\u00b2 +5/6.\n\n= (6 + 120/y\u00b2 +5)/6 = (11 + 120/y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 * [720 / (11 - 600/y\u00b2) ] * [ (11 + 120/y\u00b2 ) /6 ].\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\n4 * (720) * (11 + 120/y\u00b2) / [6 * (11 - 600/y\u00b2) ].\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n4 *720 = 2880.\n\n2880 /6 = 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480 * (11 + 120/y\u00b2 ) / (11 - 600/y\u00b2 ).\n\nLet me denote t = 1/y\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480*(11 + 120 t)/(11 - 600 t).\n\nOur goal is to find the supremum of BD\u00b2 as t varies, but t must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nSince y\u00b2 must be positive (because points are on the hyperbola), t is positive.\n\nAlso, in the denominator, 11 -600 t must not be zero, and also the denominator must not be negative because t is positive.\n\nWait, 11 -600 t must be positive, otherwise p\u00b2 would be negative, which is impossible.\n\nSo, 11 -600 t > 0 => t < 11/600 \u2248 0.018333.\n\nSo, t \u2208 (0, 11/600).\n\nSo, our function BD\u00b2(t) = 480*(11 + 120 t)/(11 -600 t).\n\nWe need to find the maximum of BD\u00b2(t) as t approaches 11/600 from below.\n\nBecause as t approaches 11/600, the denominator approaches zero, making BD\u00b2(t) approach infinity. But wait, that can't be right because the hyperbola is bounded in some way.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, when t approaches 11/600, t = 1/y\u00b2, so y\u00b2 approaches 600/11 \u224854.545.\n\nWait, but in the hyperbola equation, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, if y\u00b2 approaches 54.545, then x\u00b2 approaches 20 + (5*54.545)/6 \u2248 20 + (272.725)/6 \u224820 +45.454\u224865.454.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 approaches 65.454, which is acceptable because the hyperbola extends to infinity.\n\nBut wait, in the hyperbola equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, as y\u00b2 increases, x\u00b2 must also increase.\n\nSo, as t approaches 11/600, y\u00b2 approaches 600/11, and x\u00b2 approaches 20 + (5*(600/11))/6 =20 + (3000/11)/6=20 +500/11\u224820 +45.454\u224865.454.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 approaches ~65.454, so x approaches sqrt(65.454)\u22488.09.\n\nBut in the expression for BD\u00b2, as t approaches 11/600, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity because denominator approaches zero.\n\nBut that can't be correct because BD is a diagonal of the rhombus, which is a geometric figure on the hyperbola. So, it must have a finite maximum.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when t approaches 11/600, BD\u00b2(t) approaches infinity, but perhaps in reality, t cannot approach 11/600 because of the constraints on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, let's see. When t approaches 11/600, y\u00b2 approaches 600/11\u224854.545, which is acceptable on the hyperbola. So, theoretically, BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily large as t approaches 11/600, making the supremum of BD\u00b2 infinity. But that's not possible because the rhombus can't have an infinitely long diagonal.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Because BD\u00b2 is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), and p and q are points on the hyperbola. So, as the rhombus becomes more \"stretched,\" BD\u00b2 increases without bound.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, then the supremum is infinity, but that can't be the case because the hyperbola is unbounded.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, perhaps BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, but the question is about the lower bound? No, it says the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Wait, that wording is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says: \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, this number is the infimum of the upper bounds of BD\u00b2 across all possible rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be negative infinity, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps BD\u00b2 is bounded above.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, the area of the rhombus is (AC * BD)/2.\n\nBut since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, perhaps we can relate the lengths of the diagonals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use parametric coordinates for the hyperbola.\n\nLet me parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola.\n\nFor hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, parametric equations can be:\n\nx = sqrt(20) sec \u03b8,\n\ny = sqrt(24) tan \u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, another parametrization is using hyperbolic functions:\n\nx = sqrt(20) cosh t,\n\ny = sqrt(24) sinh t.\n\nBut since the hyperbola has two branches, points A and C are on opposite branches, so perhaps using the same parameter t for both, but with opposite signs.\n\nWait, perhaps using the parametrization with hyperbolic functions is better because it covers both branches.\n\nSo, let me denote point A as (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t).\n\nThen, point C is (-sqrt(20) cosh t, -sqrt(24) sinh t).\n\nSimilarly, point B can be parametrized as (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s).\n\nPoint D is (-sqrt(20) cosh s, -sqrt(24) sinh s).\n\nNow, since the diagonals are AC and BD, their vectors are:\n\nAC: from A to C is (-2 sqrt(20) cosh t, -2 sqrt(24) sinh t).\n\nBD: from B to D is (-2 sqrt(20) cosh s, -2 sqrt(24) sinh s).\n\nFor the diagonals to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero:\n\n[ -2 sqrt(20) cosh t ] * [ -2 sqrt(20) cosh s ] + [ -2 sqrt(24) sinh t ] * [ -2 sqrt(24) sinh s ] =0.\n\nCompute this:\n\n(4 *20 cosh t cosh s) + (4 *24 sinh t sinh s )=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n80 cosh t cosh s + 96 sinh t sinh s =0.\n\nDivide both sides by 16:\n\n5 cosh t cosh s +6 sinh t sinh s=0.\n\nSo, 5 cosh t cosh s +6 sinh t sinh s=0.\n\nHmm, this is a key equation.\n\nAlso, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, etc.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to use the fact that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and the sides are equal.\n\nAlternatively, since we have parametrized the points, we can express the condition for ABCD being a rhombus.\n\nBut perhaps first, let's try to solve the equation 5 cosh t cosh s +6 sinh t sinh s=0.\n\nLet me denote cosh t cosh s + (6/5) sinh t sinh s=0.\n\nWait, maybe we can write this as:\n\ncosh(t + s) + (6/5 -1) sinh(t + s) ??? Wait, no, that's not the identity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express it as:\n\ncosh(t + s) + something else.\n\nWait, recall that cosh(a + b) = cosh a cosh b + sinh a sinh b.\n\nSimilarly, cosh(a - b) = cosh a cosh b - sinh a sinh b.\n\nSo, 5 cosh t cosh s +6 sinh t sinh s=0.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n5 cosh(t + s) + (5 -6) sinh(t + s) =0?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n5 cosh t cosh s +6 sinh t sinh s =5 [cosh t cosh s + (6/5) sinh t sinh s ].\n\nBut 5 is a common factor, so:\n\n5 [ cosh t cosh s + (6/5) sinh t sinh s ] =0.\n\nSo, cosh t cosh s + (6/5) sinh t sinh s=0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let me divide both sides by cosh t cosh s:\n\n5 +6 (sinh t sinh s)/(cosh t cosh s) =0.\n\nWhich is:\n\n5 +6 tanh t tanh s=0.\n\nSo, tanh t tanh s= -5/6.\n\nSo, that's one condition.\n\nSo, the product of tanh t and tanh s is -5/6.\n\nSo, tanh s = -5/(6 tanh t).\n\nBut tanh s must be between -1 and 1, same with tanh t.\n\nSo, tanh t cannot be zero because that would make tanh s undefined.\n\nSo, tanh t cannot be zero, so t cannot be zero.\n\nSimilarly, |tanh t| <1, so |5/(6 tanh t)| must be less than or equal to 1.\n\nSo, |5/(6 tanh t)| <=1 => |tanh t| >=5/6.\n\nSo, |tanh t| >=5/6.\n\nSo, tanh t >=5/6 or tanh t <=-5/6.\n\nSimilarly, tanh s = -5/(6 tanh t).\n\nSo, if tanh t >=5/6, then tanh s = negative value, because tanh t is positive, so tanh s is negative.\n\nSimilarly, if tanh t <=-5/6, then tanh s is positive.\n\nSo, that gives us a relationship between t and s.\n\nNow, our goal is to find BD\u00b2, which is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nBut in our parametrization, point B is (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s).\n\nSo, p = sqrt(20) cosh s,\n\nq = sqrt(24) sinh s.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =20 cosh\u00b2 s +24 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4*(20 cosh\u00b2 s +24 sinh\u00b2 s )=80 cosh\u00b2 s +96 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 =80 cosh\u00b2 s +96 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nLet me factor this:\n\n= 16*(5 cosh\u00b2 s +6 sinh\u00b2 s).\n\nHmm, maybe we can express this in terms of hyperbolic identities.\n\nWe know that cosh\u00b2 s =1 + sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nSo, substitute:\n\n5(1 + sinh\u00b2 s) +6 sinh\u00b2 s =5 +5 sinh\u00b2 s +6 sinh\u00b2 s =5 +11 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=16*(5 +11 sinh\u00b2 s)=16*5 +16*11 sinh\u00b2 s=80 +176 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 +176 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nSince sinh\u00b2 s is always non-negative, BD\u00b2 >=80.\n\nBut we need to find the supremum of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but sinh\u00b2 s can be any non-negative number, so BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large as sinh\u00b2 s increases, which would make BD\u00b2 approach infinity. But that contradicts the problem statement, which suggests that BD\u00b2 is bounded above.\n\nWait, but in our earlier analysis, we had a condition that tanh t tanh s =-5/6.\n\nSo, sinh s can't be arbitrary.\n\nWait, let's express sinh\u00b2 s in terms of tanh s.\n\nWe know that sinh\u00b2 s = tanh\u00b2 s / (1 - tanh\u00b2 s).\n\nBecause 1 + tanh\u00b2 s = sech^{-2} s, which is 1 / cosh\u00b2 s.\n\nWait, actually, the identity is:\n\nsinh\u00b2 s = (cosh\u00b2 s -1 ) = (1 / (1 - tanh\u00b2 s )) -1 = [1 - (1 - tanh\u00b2 s ) ] / (1 - tanh\u00b2 s ) = tanh\u00b2 s / (1 - tanh\u00b2 s ).\n\nSo, sinh\u00b2 s = tanh\u00b2 s / (1 - tanh\u00b2 s ).\n\nFrom the condition tanh t tanh s = -5/6.\n\nLet me denote a = tanh t,\n\nb = tanh s.\n\nSo, a*b = -5/6.\n\nAnd from the identity sinh\u00b2 s = b\u00b2 / (1 - b\u00b2 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 +176*(b\u00b2 / (1 - b\u00b2 )).\n\nBut we also have a*b = -5/6.\n\nBut a = tanh t, which has |a| >=5/6, as established earlier.\n\nSo, let me express a in terms of b: a = (-5)/(6b).\n\nSo, since |a| >=5/6,\n\n| (-5)/(6b) | >=5/6,\n\n=> |1/b| >=1,\n\n=> |b| <=1.\n\nBut since |b| <=1, and from the hyperbolic identity, 1 - b\u00b2 must be positive, so b\u00b2 <1.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nBD\u00b2=80 +176*(b\u00b2 / (1 - b\u00b2 )).\n\nLet me express this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=80 +176*(b\u00b2)/(1 -b\u00b2).\n\nLet me denote u = b\u00b2.\n\nSo, u \u2208 (0,1).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 +176*(u)/(1 -u).\n\nSimplify:\n\n=80 +176u/(1 -u).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n=80 +176*(1 - (1 -u))/(1 -u)\n\n=80 +176*(1/(1 -u) -1 )\n\n=80 +176/(1 -u) -176.\n\n= (80 -176) +176/(1 -u).\n\n= -96 +176/(1 -u).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=176/(1 -u) -96.\n\nNow, we can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=176/(1 -u) -96.\n\nWe need to find the supremum of BD\u00b2 as u varies in (0,1), but subject to the condition that a = (-5)/(6b) has |a| >=5/6.\n\nBut since a = (-5)/(6b), and |a| >=5/6,\n\n| (-5)/(6b) | >=5/6,\n\n=> |1/b| >=1,\n\n=> |b| <=1.\n\nBut since u =b\u00b2, and b\u00b2 <1, as earlier.\n\nSo, u \u2208 (0,1).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=176/(1 -u) -96.\n\nTo maximize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize (1 -u), i.e., approach u approaching 1.\n\nAs u approaches 1, 1 -u approaches 0, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut this suggests that BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, which would mean there's no upper bound.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. If BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, then the supremum is infinity, and thus the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be negative infinity, which doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the condition from the hyperbola imposes another constraint on u.\n\nWait, let's remember that a = tanh t = (-5)/(6b).\n\nBut a = tanh t, and |a| >=5/6.\n\nSo, |a| >=5/6, which implies that t must be such that |tanh t| >=5/6.\n\nWhich in turn implies that |t| >= arctanh(5/6).\n\nBut arctanh(5/6) is a real number because 5/6 <1.\n\nSimilarly, since a = (-5)/(6b), and a = tanh t,\n\ntanh t = (-5)/(6b).\n\nBut tanh t must be between -1 and 1.\n\nSo, (-5)/(6b) must be between -1 and1.\n\nSo,\n\n-1 <= (-5)/(6b) <=1.\n\nMultiply all parts by 6b. But wait, we have to be careful with the sign of b.\n\nCase 1: b >0.\n\nThen, multiplying by 6b:\n\n-6b <= -5 <=6b.\n\nSo,\n\n-6b <=-5 =>6b >=5 =>b >=5/6.\n\nAnd,\n\n-5 <=6b =>b >=-5/6. But since b>0, this is automatically satisfied.\n\nSo, in this case, b >=5/6.\n\nCase 2: b <0.\n\nThen, multiplying by 6b (negative) reverses inequalities:\n\n-6b >=-5 >=6b.\n\nSo,\n\n-6b >=-5 =>6b <=5 =>b <=5/6.\n\nAnd,\n\n-5 >=6b =>b <= -5/6.\n\nBut since b <0, this gives b <=-5/6.\n\nSo, combining both cases, b >=5/6 or b <=-5/6.\n\nBut since u =b\u00b2, u >=25/36.\n\nSo, u \u2208 [25/36,1).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=176/(1 -u) -96.\n\nSo, u can be as low as25/36, and as high as approaching 1.\n\nSo, when u=25/36,\n\nBD\u00b2=176/(1 -25/36) -96=176/(11/36) -96=176*(36/11) -96= (176/11)*36 -96=16*36 -96=576 -96=480.\n\nAs u approaches1, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, since BD\u00b2 can be made as large as desired, the supremum is infinity, but the problem is asking for the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, then for any real number M, there exists a rhombus such that BD\u00b2 > M. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be negative infinity, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, this is the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all rhombi.\n\nWait, no, the wording is a bit confusing. It says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the supremum of the lower bounds of BD\u00b2 across all rhombi.\n\nWait, no, that would be the infimum. Let me think.\n\nWait, if we have a set S of real numbers, the \"greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\" would be the infimum of S, the greatest lower bound.\n\nBecause for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is greater than this number, and it's the greatest such number.\n\nSo, if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, but has a minimum value, then the infimum would be that minimum.\n\nBut in our earlier calculation, when u=25/36, BD\u00b2=480.\n\nIs that the minimum BD\u00b2?\n\nBecause as u increases from25/36 to1, BD\u00b2 increases from480 to infinity.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is480, and BD\u00b2 can be as large as we want.\n\nSo, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is480, because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 >=480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is480.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so any number less than480 would not satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because some rhombi have BD\u00b2=480.\n\nWait, no, the problem is to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nSo, if BD\u00b2 can be as low as480, then any number less than480 would satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but the greatest such number is480.\n\nWait, that's not correct because BD\u00b2 can be exactly480 for some rhombus. So, the number must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but if BD\u00b2 can be480, then the number must be less than480.\n\nWait, but 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2. So, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 >=480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is480.\n\nBecause for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 >=480, so any number less than480 would not be the greatest, because480 is attainable.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be exactly480, then the number must be less than480, because it has to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, including the one where BD\u00b2=480.\n\nBut then, the greatest such number would be480, but it's not less than BD\u00b2 for that rhombus. So, perhaps the supremum is480, but since BD\u00b2 can be equal to480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be480 - \u03b5, but \u03b5 approaches zero.\n\nWait, but in reality, the minimal BD\u00b2 is480, achieved when u=25/36.\n\nSo, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 >=480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is480, but since BD\u00b2 can be equal to480, you can't have a number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi that's greater than480.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is480. So, the greatest lower bound is480.\n\nBut the wording is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, it's the maximum number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for every rhombus.\n\nSince BD\u00b2 can be as small as480, m must be less than480.\n\nBut since480 is attainable, m cannot be480 because for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=480, m must be less than480.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the greatest such m. So, the supremum of m is480, but m must be less than480.\n\nWait, but in reality, m can approach480 from below, but can't reach it.\n\nSo, the answer would be480, but since480 is attainable, perhaps the problem is asking for the infimum, which is480.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimal BD\u00b2, which is480.\n\nIn any case, the minimal BD\u00b2 is480, so the answer is480.\n\nBut let me check my steps again.\n\nWe had BD\u00b2=176/(1 -u) -96, with u >=25/36.\n\nWhen u=25/36, BD\u00b2=176/(1 -25/36) -96=176/(11/36)-96=176*(36/11)-96=16*36 -96=576-96=480.\n\nAs u increases beyond25/36 towards1, BD\u00b2 increases to infinity.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is480, achieved when u=25/36.\n\nTherefore, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 >=480.\n\nHence, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is480.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 can be exactly480, the number must be less than480. So, the greatest such number is480 - \u03b5, but since \u03b5 can be as small as possible, the answer is480.\n\nBut the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, since BD\u00b2 can be480, the number must be less than480. But the greatest such number is480.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction. Because if you have a number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, and BD\u00b2 can be as low as480, then m must be <=480.\n\nBut if m=480, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, m is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, the maximum m is just below480, but since we need an exact value, perhaps the problem is asking for the infimum, which is480.\n\nSo, the answer is480.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand what's being asked. \n\nThe hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. That's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right because the positive term is with x\u00b2. The transverse axis length is 2a, where a\u00b2=20, so a=2\u221a5. The conjugate axis is 2b, with b\u00b2=24, so b=2\u221a6.\n\nNow, the problem mentions points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, and its diagonals are along the coordinate axes? Or maybe not necessarily, but their intersection is at the origin.\n\nWait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, but I'm not sure if they have to be along the axes. Hmm. But the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes and the origin. So, if the rhombus is centered at the origin, maybe the diagonals are along the axes? That would make sense because of the symmetry.\n\nWait, no, not necessarily. The diagonals could be at some angle, but their intersection is at the origin. So, the rhombus is such that the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if I consider points A and C as endpoints of one diagonal, then B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal, and the midpoints of both diagonals are at the origin.\n\nSo, for a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Therefore, if A is (x,y), then C must be (-x,-y) because the midpoint is the origin. Similarly, if B is (p,q), then D is (-p,-q). \n\nBut wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily the axes, but in this case, since the rhombus is on a hyperbola, the points are arranged such that A and C are opposite vertices, B and D are the other pair.\n\nWait, but the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola. So, each of these points must satisfy the equation.\n\nSo, let's say points A and C are (x, y) and (-x, -y). Then, points B and D are (p, q) and (-p, -q). All four points must lie on the hyperbola.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the lengths AB, BC, CD, DA are equal.\n\nAlternatively, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, if the diagonals are AC and BD, then vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular.\n\nWait, but since diagonals bisect each other at the origin, and since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, if AC is the vector from (x,y) to (-x,-y), which is (-2x, -2y), and BD is from (p,q) to (-p,-q), which is (-2p, -2q). For these vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero.\n\nSo, (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0 => 4xp + 4yq = 0 => xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, that's one condition: xp + yq = 0.\n\nAdditionally, all four points A(x,y), B(p,q), C(-x,-y), D(-p,-q) lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, each point must satisfy:\n\nFor A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nFor B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly for C and D, but since they are just negatives, they will satisfy the same equations.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\n2. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAnd the condition from the diagonals being perpendicular: xp + yq = 0.\n\nAlso, since it's a rhombus, the sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C, etc.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use vectors or parametric equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the points on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, hyperbola parametrization can be done using hyperbolic functions. For the hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a parametrization is (a cosh \u03b8, b sinh \u03b8). But since hyperbola has two branches, and our rhombus is made of four points, perhaps they are on different branches.\n\nWait, but in our hyperbola, the points A and C are on opposite ends. So, if A is on one branch, C is on the other branch because it's (-x, -y). Similarly, B and D are on the other pair of branches. Wait, actually, no. The hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 has two branches, left and right, symmetric with respect to both axes.\n\nWait, but a rhombus is a convex quadrilateral, so all four points can't be on the same branch. Because if all points are on the same branch, the figure would not be convex. So, two points on one branch and two on the other. But given the hyperbola's symmetry, I think points A and C are on opposite branches, and B and D are on opposite branches as well.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, which has two branches on the left and right. So, points A and C are on opposite branches, as their coordinates are (x,y) and (-x,-y). Similarly, B and D are on opposite branches, (p,q) and (-p,-q).\n\nSo, all four points are on the hyperbola, with two on the right branch and two on the left branch.\n\nWait, but for a rhombus, the points should be arranged such that moving from A to B to C to D, each consecutive point is a vertex of the rhombus.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of vectors.\n\nLet me denote vectors OA, OB, OC, OD as vectors from the origin to points A, B, C, D respectively. Since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides are equal, so vectors AB, BC, CD, DA should have the same magnitude.\n\nAlternatively, in a rhombus, the adjacent sides are equal and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.\n\nWait, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the vectors OA and OC are negatives of each other, same with OB and OD.\n\nSo, in that case, the diagonals are AC and BD, which are vectors from A to C and from B to D.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. So, as I mentioned before, OA \u00b7 OB = 0? Wait, no, wait. The diagonals are AC and BD.\n\nSo, vector AC is C - A = (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y).\n\nVector BD is D - B = (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q).\n\nSo, their dot product is (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 4xp + 4yq = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, that's our condition.\n\nNow, we have points A(x,y), B(p,q), C(-x,-y), D(-p,-q) on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 and p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAlso, xp + yq = 0.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2.\n\nBD is the length of the diagonal BD. Since B is (p,q) and D is (-p,-q), the distance between B and D is sqrt[( -p - p )\u00b2 + ( -q - q )\u00b2] = sqrt[(-2p)\u00b2 + (-2q)^2] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2] = 2 sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is (2 sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nOur goal is to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the supremum of BD\u00b2, which is the least upper bound.\n\nSo, we need to maximize BD\u00b2, i.e., maximize 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), given the constraints.\n\nBut wait, let's see. We have two hyperbola equations:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nand xp + yq = 0.\n\nWe can perhaps express variables in terms of each other.\n\nLet me consider variables x, y, p, q.\n\nWe have xp + yq = 0.\n\nLet me express, say, q in terms of p: q = (-xp)/y.\n\nSubstituting into the second hyperbola equation:\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2/20 - ( (x\u00b2 p\u00b2) / (y\u00b2 * 24) ) = 1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 [1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nHmm. Now, from the first hyperbola equation, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nLet me rearrange that: x\u00b2/20 = 1 + y\u00b2/24.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20(1 + y\u00b2/24) = 20 + (20 y\u00b2)/24 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2/(20) = 1 + y\u00b2/(24), which is consistent.\n\nSo, going back to the expression for p\u00b2.\n\nWe have p\u00b2 [1/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nSubstituting x\u00b2 from above:\n\np\u00b2 [1/20 - (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / (24 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nLet me compute the term inside the brackets:\n\n1/20 - [ (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / (24 y\u00b2) ].\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\n20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 = (120 + 5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, dividing by 24 y\u00b2 gives:\n\n(120 + 5 y\u00b2)/(6 * 24 y\u00b2) = (120 + 5 y\u00b2)/(144 y\u00b2) = [5(24 + y\u00b2)]/(144 y\u00b2) = (5)(24 + y\u00b2)/(144 y\u00b2).\n\nSo, the term inside the brackets is:\n\n1/20 - [5(24 + y\u00b2)]/(144 y\u00b2).\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nConvert 1/20 to a denominator of 144 y\u00b2:\n\n1/20 = (7.2 y\u00b2)/144 y\u00b2. Wait, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, let's find a common denominator.\n\nLet me write both terms with denominator 144 y\u00b2 * 20.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute numerically.\n\nWait, 1/20 = 0.05, and the other term is 5(24 + y\u00b2)/(144 y\u00b2).\n\nWait, maybe we can factor 5:\n\n= 5(24 + y\u00b2)/(144 y\u00b2) = 5/(144 y\u00b2) * (24 + y\u00b2).\n\nBut perhaps it's better to compute it as:\n\n= [ (144 y\u00b2) * 1/20 - 5(24 + y\u00b2) ] / (144 y\u00b2).\n\nWait, no, that's not the case. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recast the expression.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 [1/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nWe have x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) = [20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6]/(24 y\u00b2) = 20/(24 y\u00b2) + (5 y\u00b2)/(6 *24 y\u00b2) = (5)/(6 y\u00b2) + 5/(144).\n\nWait, let me compute each term:\n\n20/(24 y\u00b2) = (5)/(6 y\u00b2).\n\n(5 y\u00b2)/(6 *24 y\u00b2) = 5/(6*24) = 5/(144).\n\nSo, x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) = 5/(6 y\u00b2) + 5/144.\n\nSo, 1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) = 1/20 - [5/(6 y\u00b2) + 5/144] = 1/20 - 5/(6 y\u00b2) -5/144.\n\nCombine the constants:\n\n1/20 - 5/144 = (144 - 100)/2880 = 44/2880 = 11/720.\n\nSo, 1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) = 11/720 - 5/(6 y\u00b2).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 [11/720 - 5/(6 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 1 / [11/720 - 5/(6 y\u00b2) ].\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of x and y.\n\nSince BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), and from the hyperbola equation for point B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, from this equation, we can express p\u00b2 = 20(1 + q\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 [20(1 + q\u00b2/24) + q\u00b2] = 4 [20 + (20 q\u00b2)/24 + q\u00b2] = 4 [20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6 + q\u00b2] = 4 [20 + (11 q\u00b2)/6 ].\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(20) + 4*(11 q\u00b2)/6 = 80 + (22 q\u00b2)/3.\n\nHmm, but then we need to relate q\u00b2 with x and y.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express q in terms of p, using xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, q = - (xp)/y.\n\nThen, from point B's hyperbola equation: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSubstituting q = -xp/y:\n\np\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(y\u00b2 *24) =1.\n\nFactor p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 1 / [1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) ].\n\nWhich is similar to what I had earlier.\n\nBut from point A's hyperbola equation: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, substituting x\u00b2 into p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 = 1 / [1/20 - (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 )/(24 y\u00b2) ].\n\nLet me compute the denominator:\n\n1/20 - [ (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / (24 y\u00b2) ].\n\nCompute the second term:\n\n(20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / (24 y\u00b2) = 20/(24 y\u00b2) + (5 y\u00b2)/(6 *24 y\u00b2) = (5)/(6 y\u00b2) + 5/(144).\n\nSo, denominator becomes:\n\n1/20 - 5/(6 y\u00b2) -5/144.\n\nCombine constants:\n\n1/20 -5/144 = (144 - 100)/2880 = 44/2880 = 11/720.\n\nSo, denominator is 11/720 -5/(6 y\u00b2).\n\nThus, p\u00b2 = 1 / [11/720 -5/(6 y\u00b2) ].\n\nLet me write this as:\n\np\u00b2 = 1 / [ (11 - 60 y\u00b2/720 ) / 720 ].\n\nWait, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, let me factor out 1/720:\n\nDenominator: 11/720 -5/(6 y\u00b2) = [11 - 60/(720 y\u00b2) *5 ]? Wait, perhaps better to write as:\n\n= (11)/(720) - (5)/(6 y\u00b2) = (11)/(720) - (5 * 120)/(720 y\u00b2) ) = [11 - (600)/(y\u00b2)] /720.\n\nWait, 5/(6 y\u00b2) = (5 * 120)/(720 y\u00b2) = 600/(720 y\u00b2). Wait, 5/(6 y\u00b2) = (5 * 120)/(720 y\u00b2) because 6*120=720. So, 5/(6 y\u00b2) = (600)/(720 y\u00b2). So, denominator becomes [11 - (600)/(y\u00b2)] /720.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 1 / [ (11 - 600/y\u00b2)/720 ] = 720 / (11 - 600/y\u00b2).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 720 / (11 - 600/y\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nBut q = -xp/y, so q\u00b2 = x\u00b2 p\u00b2 / y\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + x\u00b2 p\u00b2 / y\u00b2 ) = 4 p\u00b2 (1 + x\u00b2 / y\u00b2 ).\n\nSubstituting p\u00b2 from above:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * [720 / (11 - 600/y\u00b2) ] * [1 + x\u00b2 / y\u00b2 ].\n\nBut x\u00b2 =20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6, so x\u00b2 / y\u00b2 = 20/y\u00b2 + 5/6.\n\nSo, 1 + x\u00b2 / y\u00b2 = 1 + 20/y\u00b2 +5/6 = (6 + 120/y\u00b2 +5)/6 = (11 + 120/y\u00b2)/6.\n\nWait, let me compute 1 + x\u00b2/y\u00b2:\n\n1 + x\u00b2/y\u00b2 = 1 + (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / y\u00b2 = 1 + 20/y\u00b2 +5/6.\n\n= (6 + 120/y\u00b2 +5)/6 = (11 + 120/y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 * [720 / (11 - 600/y\u00b2) ] * [ (11 + 120/y\u00b2 ) /6 ].\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\n4 * (720) * (11 + 120/y\u00b2) / [6 * (11 - 600/y\u00b2) ].\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n4 *720 = 2880.\n\n2880 /6 = 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480 * (11 + 120/y\u00b2 ) / (11 - 600/y\u00b2 ).\n\nLet me denote t = 1/y\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480*(11 + 120 t)/(11 - 600 t).\n\nOur goal is to find the supremum of BD\u00b2 as t varies, but t must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nSince y\u00b2 must be positive (because points are on the hyperbola), t is positive.\n\nAlso, in the denominator, 11 -600 t must not be zero, and also the denominator must not be negative because t is positive.\n\nWait, 11 -600 t must be positive, otherwise p\u00b2 would be negative, which is impossible.\n\nSo, 11 -600 t > 0 => t < 11/600 \u2248 0.018333.\n\nSo, t \u2208 (0, 11/600).\n\nSo, our function BD\u00b2(t) = 480*(11 + 120 t)/(11 -600 t).\n\nWe need to find the maximum of BD\u00b2(t) as t approaches 11/600 from below.\n\nBecause as t approaches 11/600, the denominator approaches zero, making BD\u00b2(t) approach infinity. But wait, that can't be right because the hyperbola is bounded in some way.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, when t approaches 11/600, t = 1/y\u00b2, so y\u00b2 approaches 600/11 \u224854.545.\n\nWait, but in the hyperbola equation, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, if y\u00b2 approaches 54.545, then x\u00b2 approaches 20 + (5*54.545)/6 \u2248 20 + (272.725)/6 \u224820 +45.454\u224865.454.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 approaches 65.454, which is acceptable because the hyperbola extends to infinity.\n\nBut wait, in the hyperbola equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, as y\u00b2 increases, x\u00b2 must also increase.\n\nSo, as t approaches 11/600, y\u00b2 approaches 600/11, and x\u00b2 approaches 20 + (5*(600/11))/6 =20 + (3000/11)/6=20 +500/11\u224820 +45.454\u224865.454.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 approaches ~65.454, so x approaches sqrt(65.454)\u22488.09.\n\nBut in the expression for BD\u00b2, as t approaches 11/600, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity because denominator approaches zero.\n\nBut that can't be correct because BD is a diagonal of the rhombus, which is a geometric figure on the hyperbola. So, it must have a finite maximum.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when t approaches 11/600, BD\u00b2(t) approaches infinity, but perhaps in reality, t cannot approach 11/600 because of the constraints on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, let's see. When t approaches 11/600, y\u00b2 approaches 600/11\u224854.545, which is acceptable on the hyperbola. So, theoretically, BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily large as t approaches 11/600, making the supremum of BD\u00b2 infinity. But that's not possible because the rhombus can't have an infinitely long diagonal.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Because BD\u00b2 is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), and p and q are points on the hyperbola. So, as the rhombus becomes more \"stretched,\" BD\u00b2 increases without bound.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, then the supremum is infinity, but that can't be the case because the hyperbola is unbounded.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, perhaps BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, but the question is about the lower bound? No, it says the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Wait, that wording is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says: \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, this number is the infimum of the upper bounds of BD\u00b2 across all possible rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be negative infinity, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps BD\u00b2 is bounded above.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, the area of the rhombus is (AC * BD)/2.\n\nBut since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, perhaps we can relate the lengths of the diagonals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use parametric coordinates for the hyperbola.\n\nLet me parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola.\n\nFor hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, parametric equations can be:\n\nx = sqrt(20) sec \u03b8,\n\ny = sqrt(24) tan \u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, another parametrization is using hyperbolic functions:\n\nx = sqrt(20) cosh t,\n\ny = sqrt(24) sinh t.\n\nBut since the hyperbola has two branches, points A and C are on opposite branches, so perhaps using the same parameter t for both, but with opposite signs.\n\nWait, perhaps using the parametrization with hyperbolic functions is better because it covers both branches.\n\nSo, let me denote point A as (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t).\n\nThen, point C is (-sqrt(20) cosh t, -sqrt(24) sinh t).\n\nSimilarly, point B can be parametrized as (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s).\n\nPoint D is (-sqrt(20) cosh s, -sqrt(24) sinh s).\n\nNow, since the diagonals are AC and BD, their vectors are:\n\nAC: from A to C is (-2 sqrt(20) cosh t, -2 sqrt(24) sinh t).\n\nBD: from B to D is (-2 sqrt(20) cosh s, -2 sqrt(24) sinh s).\n\nFor the diagonals to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero:\n\n[ -2 sqrt(20) cosh t ] * [ -2 sqrt(20) cosh s ] + [ -2 sqrt(24) sinh t ] * [ -2 sqrt(24) sinh s ] =0.\n\nCompute this:\n\n(4 *20 cosh t cosh s) + (4 *24 sinh t sinh s )=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n80 cosh t cosh s + 96 sinh t sinh s =0.\n\nDivide both sides by 16:\n\n5 cosh t cosh s +6 sinh t sinh s=0.\n\nSo, 5 cosh t cosh s +6 sinh t sinh s=0.\n\nHmm, this is a key equation.\n\nAlso, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, etc.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to use the fact that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and the sides are equal.\n\nAlternatively, since we have parametrized the points, we can express the condition for ABCD being a rhombus.\n\nBut perhaps first, let's try to solve the equation 5 cosh t cosh s +6 sinh t sinh s=0.\n\nLet me denote cosh t cosh s + (6/5) sinh t sinh s=0.\n\nWait, maybe we can write this as:\n\ncosh(t + s) + (6/5 -1) sinh(t + s) ??? Wait, no, that's not the identity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express it as:\n\ncosh(t + s) + something else.\n\nWait, recall that cosh(a + b) = cosh a cosh b + sinh a sinh b.\n\nSimilarly, cosh(a - b) = cosh a cosh b - sinh a sinh b.\n\nSo, 5 cosh t cosh s +6 sinh t sinh s=0.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n5 cosh(t + s) + (5 -6) sinh(t + s) =0?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n5 cosh t cosh s +6 sinh t sinh s =5 [cosh t cosh s + (6/5) sinh t sinh s ].\n\nBut 5 is a common factor, so:\n\n5 [ cosh t cosh s + (6/5) sinh t sinh s ] =0.\n\nSo, cosh t cosh s + (6/5) sinh t sinh s=0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let me divide both sides by cosh t cosh s:\n\n5 +6 (sinh t sinh s)/(cosh t cosh s) =0.\n\nWhich is:\n\n5 +6 tanh t tanh s=0.\n\nSo, tanh t tanh s= -5/6.\n\nSo, that's one condition.\n\nSo, the product of tanh t and tanh s is -5/6.\n\nSo, tanh s = -5/(6 tanh t).\n\nBut tanh s must be between -1 and 1, same with tanh t.\n\nSo, tanh t cannot be zero because that would make tanh s undefined.\n\nSo, tanh t cannot be zero, so t cannot be zero.\n\nSimilarly, |tanh t| <1, so |5/(6 tanh t)| must be less than or equal to 1.\n\nSo, |5/(6 tanh t)| <=1 => |tanh t| >=5/6.\n\nSo, |tanh t| >=5/6.\n\nSo, tanh t >=5/6 or tanh t <=-5/6.\n\nSimilarly, tanh s = -5/(6 tanh t).\n\nSo, if tanh t >=5/6, then tanh s = negative value, because tanh t is positive, so tanh s is negative.\n\nSimilarly, if tanh t <=-5/6, then tanh s is positive.\n\nSo, that gives us a relationship between t and s.\n\nNow, our goal is to find BD\u00b2, which is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nBut in our parametrization, point B is (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s).\n\nSo, p = sqrt(20) cosh s,\n\nq = sqrt(24) sinh s.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =20 cosh\u00b2 s +24 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4*(20 cosh\u00b2 s +24 sinh\u00b2 s )=80 cosh\u00b2 s +96 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 =80 cosh\u00b2 s +96 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nLet me factor this:\n\n= 16*(5 cosh\u00b2 s +6 sinh\u00b2 s).\n\nHmm, maybe we can express this in terms of hyperbolic identities.\n\nWe know that cosh\u00b2 s =1 + sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nSo, substitute:\n\n5(1 + sinh\u00b2 s) +6 sinh\u00b2 s =5 +5 sinh\u00b2 s +6 sinh\u00b2 s =5 +11 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=16*(5 +11 sinh\u00b2 s)=16*5 +16*11 sinh\u00b2 s=80 +176 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 +176 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nSince sinh\u00b2 s is always non-negative, BD\u00b2 >=80.\n\nBut we need to find the supremum of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but sinh\u00b2 s can be any non-negative number, so BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large as sinh\u00b2 s increases, which would make BD\u00b2 approach infinity. But that contradicts the problem statement, which suggests that BD\u00b2 is bounded above.\n\nWait, but in our earlier analysis, we had a condition that tanh t tanh s =-5/6.\n\nSo, sinh s can't be arbitrary.\n\nWait, let's express sinh\u00b2 s in terms of tanh s.\n\nWe know that sinh\u00b2 s = tanh\u00b2 s / (1 - tanh\u00b2 s).\n\nBecause 1 + tanh\u00b2 s = sech^{-2} s, which is 1 / cosh\u00b2 s.\n\nWait, actually, the identity is:\n\nsinh\u00b2 s = (cosh\u00b2 s -1 ) = (1 / (1 - tanh\u00b2 s )) -1 = [1 - (1 - tanh\u00b2 s ) ] / (1 - tanh\u00b2 s ) = tanh\u00b2 s / (1 - tanh\u00b2 s ).\n\nSo, sinh\u00b2 s = tanh\u00b2 s / (1 - tanh\u00b2 s ).\n\nFrom the condition tanh t tanh s = -5/6.\n\nLet me denote a = tanh t,\n\nb = tanh s.\n\nSo, a*b = -5/6.\n\nAnd from the identity sinh\u00b2 s = b\u00b2 / (1 - b\u00b2 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 +176*(b\u00b2 / (1 - b\u00b2 )).\n\nBut we also have a*b = -5/6.\n\nBut a = tanh t, which has |a| >=5/6, as established earlier.\n\nSo, let me express a in terms of b: a = (-5)/(6b).\n\nSo, since |a| >=5/6,\n\n| (-5)/(6b) | >=5/6,\n\n=> |1/b| >=1,\n\n=> |b| <=1.\n\nBut since |b| <=1, and from the hyperbolic identity, 1 - b\u00b2 must be positive, so b\u00b2 <1.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nBD\u00b2=80 +176*(b\u00b2 / (1 - b\u00b2 )).\n\nLet me express this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=80 +176*(b\u00b2)/(1 -b\u00b2).\n\nLet me denote u = b\u00b2.\n\nSo, u \u2208 (0,1).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 +176*(u)/(1 -u).\n\nSimplify:\n\n=80 +176u/(1 -u).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n=80 +176*(1 - (1 -u))/(1 -u)\n\n=80 +176*(1/(1 -u) -1 )\n\n=80 +176/(1 -u) -176.\n\n= (80 -176) +176/(1 -u).\n\n= -96 +176/(1 -u).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=176/(1 -u) -96.\n\nNow, we can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=176/(1 -u) -96.\n\nWe need to find the supremum of BD\u00b2 as u varies in (0,1), but subject to the condition that a = (-5)/(6b) has |a| >=5/6.\n\nBut since a = (-5)/(6b), and |a| >=5/6,\n\n| (-5)/(6b) | >=5/6,\n\n=> |1/b| >=1,\n\n=> |b| <=1.\n\nBut since u =b\u00b2, and b\u00b2 <1, as earlier.\n\nSo, u \u2208 (0,1).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=176/(1 -u) -96.\n\nTo maximize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize (1 -u), i.e., approach u approaching 1.\n\nAs u approaches 1, 1 -u approaches 0, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut this suggests that BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, which would mean there's no upper bound.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. If BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, then the supremum is infinity, and thus the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be negative infinity, which doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the condition from the hyperbola imposes another constraint on u.\n\nWait, let's remember that a = tanh t = (-5)/(6b).\n\nBut a = tanh t, and |a| >=5/6.\n\nSo, |a| >=5/6, which implies that t must be such that |tanh t| >=5/6.\n\nWhich in turn implies that |t| >= arctanh(5/6).\n\nBut arctanh(5/6) is a real number because 5/6 <1.\n\nSimilarly, since a = (-5)/(6b), and a = tanh t,\n\ntanh t = (-5)/(6b).\n\nBut tanh t must be between -1 and 1.\n\nSo, (-5)/(6b) must be between -1 and1.\n\nSo,\n\n-1 <= (-5)/(6b) <=1.\n\nMultiply all parts by 6b. But wait, we have to be careful with the sign of b.\n\nCase 1: b >0.\n\nThen, multiplying by 6b:\n\n-6b <= -5 <=6b.\n\nSo,\n\n-6b <=-5 =>6b >=5 =>b >=5/6.\n\nAnd,\n\n-5 <=6b =>b >=-5/6. But since b>0, this is automatically satisfied.\n\nSo, in this case, b >=5/6.\n\nCase 2: b <0.\n\nThen, multiplying by 6b (negative) reverses inequalities:\n\n-6b >=-5 >=6b.\n\nSo,\n\n-6b >=-5 =>6b <=5 =>b <=5/6.\n\nAnd,\n\n-5 >=6b =>b <= -5/6.\n\nBut since b <0, this gives b <=-5/6.\n\nSo, combining both cases, b >=5/6 or b <=-5/6.\n\nBut since u =b\u00b2, u >=25/36.\n\nSo, u \u2208 [25/36,1).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=176/(1 -u) -96.\n\nSo, u can be as low as25/36, and as high as approaching 1.\n\nSo, when u=25/36,\n\nBD\u00b2=176/(1 -25/36) -96=176/(11/36) -96=176*(36/11) -96= (176/11)*36 -96=16*36 -96=576 -96=480.\n\nAs u approaches1, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, since BD\u00b2 can be made as large as desired, the supremum is infinity, but the problem is asking for the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, then for any real number M, there exists a rhombus such that BD\u00b2 > M. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be negative infinity, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, this is the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all rhombi.\n\nWait, no, the wording is a bit confusing. It says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the supremum of the lower bounds of BD\u00b2 across all rhombi.\n\nWait, no, that would be the infimum. Let me think.\n\nWait, if we have a set S of real numbers, the \"greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\" would be the infimum of S, the greatest lower bound.\n\nBecause for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is greater than this number, and it's the greatest such number.\n\nSo, if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, but has a minimum value, then the infimum would be that minimum.\n\nBut in our earlier calculation, when u=25/36, BD\u00b2=480.\n\nIs that the minimum BD\u00b2?\n\nBecause as u increases from25/36 to1, BD\u00b2 increases from480 to infinity.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is480, and BD\u00b2 can be as large as we want.\n\nSo, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is480, because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 >=480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is480.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so any number less than480 would not satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because some rhombi have BD\u00b2=480.\n\nWait, no, the problem is to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nSo, if BD\u00b2 can be as low as480, then any number less than480 would satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but the greatest such number is480.\n\nWait, that's not correct because BD\u00b2 can be exactly480 for some rhombus. So, the number must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but if BD\u00b2 can be480, then the number must be less than480.\n\nWait, but 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2. So, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 >=480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is480.\n\nBecause for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 >=480, so any number less than480 would not be the greatest, because480 is attainable.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be exactly480, then the number must be less than480, because it has to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, including the one where BD\u00b2=480.\n\nBut then, the greatest such number would be480, but it's not less than BD\u00b2 for that rhombus. So, perhaps the supremum is480, but since BD\u00b2 can be equal to480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be480 - \u03b5, but \u03b5 approaches zero.\n\nWait, but in reality, the minimal BD\u00b2 is480, achieved when u=25/36.\n\nSo, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 >=480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is480, but since BD\u00b2 can be equal to480, you can't have a number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi that's greater than480.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is480. So, the greatest lower bound is480.\n\nBut the wording is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, it's the maximum number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for every rhombus.\n\nSince BD\u00b2 can be as small as480, m must be less than480.\n\nBut since480 is attainable, m cannot be480 because for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=480, m must be less than480.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the greatest such m. So, the supremum of m is480, but m must be less than480.\n\nWait, but in reality, m can approach480 from below, but can't reach it.\n\nSo, the answer would be480, but since480 is attainable, perhaps the problem is asking for the infimum, which is480.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimal BD\u00b2, which is480.\n\nIn any case, the minimal BD\u00b2 is480, so the answer is480.\n\nBut let me check my steps again.\n\nWe had BD\u00b2=176/(1 -u) -96, with u >=25/36.\n\nWhen u=25/36, BD\u00b2=176/(1 -25/36) -96=176/(11/36)-96=176*(36/11)-96=16*36 -96=576-96=480.\n\nAs u increases beyond25/36 towards1, BD\u00b2 increases to infinity.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is480, achieved when u=25/36.\n\nTherefore, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 >=480.\n\nHence, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is480.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 can be exactly480, the number must be less than480. So, the greatest such number is480 - \u03b5, but since \u03b5 can be as small as possible, the answer is480.\n\nBut the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, since BD\u00b2 can be480, the number must be less than480. But the greatest such number is480.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction. Because if you have a number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, and BD\u00b2 can be as low as480, then m must be <=480.\n\nBut if m=480, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, m is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, the maximum m is just below480, but since we need an exact value, perhaps the problem is asking for the infimum, which is480.\n\nSo, the answer is480.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus formed by points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\). The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, implying symmetry and perpendicularity. Using parametric equations and hyperbolic identities, we determine that the minimal value of \\(BD^2\\) is 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is \\(\\boxed{480}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Alright, so I've got this math problem here. It involves a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step.\n\nThe problem says: Let A, B, C, and D be points on the hyperbola (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1 such that ABCD is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. We need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the hyperbola equation is given as x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. That's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening horizontally because the positive term is with x\u00b2.\n\nA rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, I think. But wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Oh wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yeah, that's right. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at 90 degrees, and they are not equal unless it's a square.\n\nBut in this case, the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, with its diagonals crossing at the origin.\n\nSo, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and ABCD is a rhombus. So, each side is equal, and the diagonals intersect at the origin.\n\nGiven that, we need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the maximum possible BD\u00b2 is perhaps the supremum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi, and we need the greatest number less than that supremum.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's like the infimum of the suprema? Or perhaps it's the maximum lower bound for BD\u00b2. Hmm, not entirely sure, but maybe I'll get to that later.\n\nFirst, let me think about the structure of the rhombus.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, we can denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Let\u2019s say AC and BD intersect at the origin. So, the diagonals bisect each other, meaning the origin is the midpoint of both AC and BD.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, AC is perpendicular to BD. Also, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal unless it's a square, which it isn't in this case because the hyperbola is not a circle.\n\nSo, let's model this. Let\u2019s denote the coordinates of the points.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, we can denote the points as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s say point A is (p, q), then point C would be (-p, -q), since the midpoint is the origin.\n\nSimilarly, points B and D would be (r, s) and (-r, -s), respectively.\n\nSo, the four points are A(p, q), B(r, s), C(-p, -q), D(-r, -s).\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nLet me write down the vectors.\n\nVector AB is (r - p, s - q).\n\nVector BC is (-p - r, -q - s).\n\nVector CD is (-r + p, -s + q).\n\nVector DA is (p + r, q + s).\n\nWait, but since it's a rhombus, all these vectors should have the same magnitude.\n\nAlternatively, since all sides are equal, the distance between consecutive points should be equal.\n\nSo, distance AB = distance BC = distance CD = distance DA.\n\nSo, let me write the distance formula.\n\nDistance AB: sqrt[(r - p)^2 + (s - q)^2]\n\nDistance BC: sqrt[(-p - r)^2 + (-q - s)^2]\n\nSet them equal:\n\n(r - p)^2 + (s - q)^2 = (-p - r)^2 + (-q - s)^2\n\nLet me compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: (r - p)^2 + (s - q)^2 = (r\u00b2 - 2pr + p\u00b2) + (s\u00b2 - 2qs + q\u00b2)\n\nRight side: (-p - r)^2 + (-q - s)^2 = (p + r)^2 + (q + s)^2 = (p\u00b2 + 2pr + r\u00b2) + (q\u00b2 + 2qs + s\u00b2)\n\nSet them equal:\n\n(r\u00b2 - 2pr + p\u00b2 + s\u00b2 - 2qs + q\u00b2) = (p\u00b2 + 2pr + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qs + s\u00b2)\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft: p\u00b2 + r\u00b2 - 2pr + q\u00b2 + s\u00b2 - 2qs\n\nRight: p\u00b2 + r\u00b2 + 2pr + q\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + 2qs\n\nSubtract left from right:\n\n0 = 4pr + 4qs\n\nSo, 4pr + 4qs = 0 => pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, pr + qs = 0. That's one condition.\n\nSimilarly, since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular.\n\nWait, AC is from (p, q) to (-p, -q), so the vector AC is (-2p, -2q). Similarly, BD is from (r, s) to (-r, -s), so the vector BD is (-2r, -2s).\n\nWait, but the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular.\n\nSo, the dot product of AC and BD should be zero.\n\nWait, AC is ( -2p, -2q ), BD is ( -2r, -2s ).\n\nWait, actually, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, the vector AC is from A to C, which is (-2p, -2q). The vector BD is from B to D, which is (-2r, -2s).\n\nBut the diagonals are AC and BD, so their vectors are AC = C - A = (-2p, -2q) and BD = D - B = (-2r, -2s).\n\nSo, for them to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero.\n\nSo,\n\nAC \u2022 BD = (-2p)(-2r) + (-2q)(-2s) = 4pr + 4qs = 0.\n\nWait, but earlier, from the equality of sides, we had pr + qs = 0. So, 4pr + 4qs = 0 is the same condition. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, that's one condition: pr + qs = 0.\n\nAnother condition is that all four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, substituting point A: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, point B: r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, both A and B lie on the hyperbola, and due to symmetry, so do C and D.\n\nSo, we have two hyperbola equations:\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nr\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, now, the problem is to find the maximum possible BD\u00b2, but wait, the problem says to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, perhaps BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to a certain value, but never actually reaching it. So, we're looking for the supremum of BD\u00b2, but the greatest number less than that supremum would just be the supremum itself if it's attainable, but if not, it's the next lower bound.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the maximum possible value of BD\u00b2, which would be the supremum, and then if that's attainable, then it's the maximum, but if not, then the greatest number less than it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps BD\u00b2 can get as large as possible, but since the hyperbola extends to infinity, BD\u00b2 could also be as large as possible. But that doesn't make sense because the hyperbola is a hyperbola, so perhaps there's a constraint.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are related to the sides. So, maybe the diagonals can't be too long or too short.\n\nWait, let's think about the diagonals.\n\nIn a rhombus, the area can be expressed as (d1 * d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.\n\nAlso, since the sides are equal, and the diagonals are perpendicular, we can relate the sides to the diagonals.\n\nIn a rhombus, each side can be expressed in terms of the diagonals as (sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 )).\n\nSo, for our case, the side length squared is (d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2)/4.\n\nBut in our problem, all four points lie on the hyperbola, so their coordinates must satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nSo, points A(p, q) and B(r, s) are on the hyperbola, so p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1, and r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAdditionally, from the rhombus condition, we have pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, our variables are p, q, r, s, with these constraints.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2. Let's figure out BD.\n\nPoint B is (r, s), point D is (-r, -s). So, the distance BD is the distance between (r, s) and (-r, -s), which is sqrt[ ( -r - r )\u00b2 + ( -s - s )\u00b2 ] = sqrt[ (-2r)^2 + (-2s)^2 ] = sqrt[4r\u00b2 + 4s\u00b2] = 2 sqrt(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD squared is [2 sqrt(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2)]\u00b2 = 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2).\n\nSo, we need to maximize BD\u00b2, which is equivalent to maximizing (r\u00b2 + s\u00b2), given the constraints.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, perhaps the maximum BD\u00b2 is unbounded? But that can't be because points on the hyperbola can go to infinity, but in a rhombus, the points are connected, so perhaps BD\u00b2 can't be too large without violating some other condition.\n\nWait, but the hyperbola extends to infinity, so r and s could be as large as possible, making BD\u00b2 as large as possible. But that doesn't seem right because the rhombus has to satisfy all four points being on the hyperbola and the sides being equal. Maybe there's a constraint that limits how large BD can be.\n\nWait, let's think about the diagonals. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, if we have points A(p, q), B(r, s), then the diagonals are AC and BD. So, AC has length sqrt( (2p)^2 + (2q)^2 ) = 2 sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Similarly, BD has length 2 sqrt(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2).\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy the relationship: (d1)^2 + (d2)^2 = 4 * (side length)^2.\n\nBut in our case, the side length squared is (AB)^2 = (r - p)^2 + (s - q)^2.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can relate p, q, r, s in a different way.\n\nWe have the two hyperbola equations:\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nr\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAnd the condition pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, let's try to express everything in terms of p and q, or some other variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can parametrize the hyperbola.\n\nSince it's a hyperbola, we can parametrize it using hyperbolic functions.\n\nFor hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a parametrization is x = a cosh \u03b8, y = b sinh \u03b8.\n\nSo, for our hyperbola, a\u00b2 = 20, so a = 2\u221a5, and b\u00b2 = 24, so b = 2\u221a6.\n\nSo, point A can be written as (2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, point B can be written as (2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6).\n\nBut then, the condition pr + qs = 0 becomes:\n\n(2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8)(2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6) + (2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8)(2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6) = 0.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n(2\u221a5 * 2\u221a5) cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + (2\u221a6 * 2\u221a6) sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0.\n\nSo, (20) cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + (24) sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n20 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 24 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's an equation relating \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0.\n\nHmm, maybe factor this as:\n\n5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 = -6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6.\n\nDivide both sides by cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6:\n\n5 = -6 (sinh \u03b8 / cosh \u03b8) (sinh \u03c6 / cosh \u03c6).\n\nSimplify:\n\n5 = -6 tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6.\n\nSo,\n\ntanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, that's a relation between \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nSo, tanh \u03c6 = (-5)/(6 tanh \u03b8).\n\nHmm, interesting.\n\nBut perhaps we can express \u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that points A and B are on the hyperbola, and their coordinates satisfy pr + qs = 0.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of vectors.\n\nWe have points A(p, q), B(r, s).\n\nFrom the hyperbola, p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nSimilarly, r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAnd pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, the vectors (p, q) and (r, s) are such that their dot product is zero.\n\nWait, no, the dot product is pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, vectors OA and OB are perpendicular, since their dot product is zero.\n\nWait, OA is the vector from the origin to A, which is (p, q).\n\nSimilarly, OB is (r, s).\n\nSo, OA \u2022 OB = pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, OA is perpendicular to OB.\n\nThat's an important point.\n\nSo, points A and B are on the hyperbola, and the vectors OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nSo, maybe this can be used to parametrize the problem.\n\nSo, if OA is perpendicular to OB, and both points lie on the hyperbola, then we can perhaps find a relationship between their coordinates.\n\nSo, suppose OA is (p, q), then OB must satisfy pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, let's consider that.\n\nLet me think about the parametrization.\n\nSuppose OA is (p, q), then OB must be (r, s) such that pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps if OA is (p, q), then OB is proportional to (-q, p) or (q, -p), but scaled appropriately to lie on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, because if OA is (p, q), then a vector perpendicular to OA is (-q, p) or (q, -p).\n\nSo, perhaps OB is a scalar multiple of (-q, p), but scaled to lie on the hyperbola.\n\nLet me see.\n\nSuppose OB = k*(-q, p), where k is a scalar.\n\nThen, OB would be (-kq, kp).\n\nSince OB lies on the hyperbola, substituting into the equation:\n\n(-kq)^2 /20 - (kp)^2 /24 = 1.\n\nSo,\n\n(k\u00b2 q\u00b2)/20 - (k\u00b2 p\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nFactor out k\u00b2:\n\nk\u00b2 ( q\u00b2 /20 - p\u00b2 /24 ) = 1.\n\nBut from point A, we know that p\u00b2 /20 - q\u00b2 /24 = 1.\n\nWait, so q\u00b2 /20 - p\u00b2 /24 = - (p\u00b2 /20 - q\u00b2 /24 ) = -1.\n\nSo, substituting back, we have:\n\nk\u00b2 (-1) = 1 => k\u00b2 = -1.\n\nWait, that's a problem because k\u00b2 can't be negative.\n\nHmm, that suggests that this approach might not work because we end up with a negative k\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps we should take the other perpendicular direction, i.e., (q, -p).\n\nSo, suppose OB is proportional to (q, -p). So, OB = k*(q, -p).\n\nThen, OB = (kq, -kp).\n\nSubstituting into the hyperbola equation:\n\n(kq)^2 /20 - (-kp)^2 /24 = 1.\n\nSo,\n\nk\u00b2 q\u00b2 /20 - k\u00b2 p\u00b2 /24 = 1.\n\nFactor k\u00b2:\n\nk\u00b2 ( q\u00b2 /20 - p\u00b2 /24 ) = 1.\n\nAgain, q\u00b2 /20 - p\u00b2 /24 = -(p\u00b2 /20 - q\u00b2 /24 ) = -1.\n\nSo,\n\nk\u00b2 (-1) = 1 => k\u00b2 = -1.\n\nSame issue, k\u00b2 negative. Hmm.\n\nSo, this approach leads to a contradiction. Maybe because if OA is on the hyperbola, then a perpendicular vector scaled to lie on the hyperbola would require k\u00b2 to be negative, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps such a point B cannot exist unless we allow complex numbers, which we aren't.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, maybe the only way for OA and OB to be perpendicular is if the points A and B are such that the product pr + qs is zero, but without being scalar multiples of each other's perpendicular vectors.\n\nSo, perhaps we need a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that since OA and OB are perpendicular, the product pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, we can think of points A(p, q) and B(r, s) such that OA and OB are perpendicular vectors.\n\nSo, the set of points A and B lying on the hyperbola and OA perpendicular to OB.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parametrize point A as (p, q) on the hyperbola, and point B as (r, s) on the hyperbola with pr + qs = 0.\n\nWe can also note that the product pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, let me think about using Lagrange multipliers to maximize BD\u00b2 = 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2), given that r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 = 1 and pr + qs = 0.\n\nBut we also have p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nWait, but this might involve multiple variables. Maybe it's better to express r and s in terms of p and q.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize point A as (p, q) on the hyperbola, then express point B in terms of p and q, using the condition pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, for a given A(p, q), point B(r, s) must satisfy r = (-q t), s = p t, for some scalar t, because pr + qs = 0.\n\nWait, let me see. If pr + qs = 0, then for a given A(p, q), point B must satisfy r = (-q/k) s, where k is some constant.\n\nWait, perhaps more straightforwardly, since pr + qs = 0, we can express r = (-qs)/p.\n\nSo, r = (-q s)/p.\n\nThen, since B(r, s) lies on the hyperbola, we have r\u00b2 /20 - s\u00b2 /24 = 1.\n\nSubstituting r = (-q s)/p,\n\n[ (q\u00b2 s\u00b2) / p\u00b2 ] /20 - s\u00b2 /24 = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(q\u00b2 s\u00b2)/(20 p\u00b2) - s\u00b2 /24 = 1.\n\nFactor out s\u00b2:\n\ns\u00b2 [ q\u00b2/(20 p\u00b2) - 1/24 ] = 1.\n\nSo,\n\ns\u00b2 = 1 / [ q\u00b2/(20 p\u00b2) - 1/24 ].\n\nBut from point A, we have p\u00b2 /20 - q\u00b2 /24 = 1.\n\nLet me solve for q\u00b2 in terms of p\u00b2.\n\nFrom p\u00b2 /20 - q\u00b2 /24 = 1,\n\nMultiply both sides by 24*20=480:\n\n24 p\u00b2 - 20 q\u00b2 = 480.\n\nSo,\n\n24 p\u00b2 - 20 q\u00b2 = 480.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n6 p\u00b2 - 5 q\u00b2 = 120.\n\nSo, 6 p\u00b2 - 5 q\u00b2 = 120.\n\nWe can solve for q\u00b2:\n\n5 q\u00b2 = 6 p\u00b2 - 120,\n\nq\u00b2 = (6 p\u00b2 - 120)/5.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = (6/5) p\u00b2 - 24.\n\nSo, now, let's plug this back into the expression for s\u00b2.\n\ns\u00b2 = 1 / [ q\u00b2/(20 p\u00b2) - 1/24 ].\n\nSubstitute q\u00b2:\n\ns\u00b2 = 1 / [ ( (6/5 p\u00b2 - 24 ) / (20 p\u00b2) ) - 1/24 ].\n\nLet me compute the denominator:\n\nFirst term: (6/5 p\u00b2 - 24) / (20 p\u00b2) = [6/5 p\u00b2 -24]/(20 p\u00b2) = (6/(5*20)) - 24/(20 p\u00b2) = (6/100) - (24)/(20 p\u00b2) = (3/50) - (6)/(5 p\u00b2).\n\nSecond term: -1/24.\n\nSo, the denominator becomes:\n\n(3/50 - 6/(5 p\u00b2)) - 1/24.\n\nCompute this:\n\nConvert to a common denominator. Let's find a common denominator for 50, 24, and 5 p\u00b2.\n\nBut this might get messy. Alternatively, perhaps let me compute each term as fractions.\n\nCompute 3/50 - 1/24:\n\nFind a common denominator for 50 and 24, which is 600.\n\n3/50 = 36/600,\n\n1/24 = 25/600.\n\nSo,\n\n3/50 - 1/24 = (36 -25)/600 = 11/600.\n\nThen, subtract 6/(5 p\u00b2):\n\nSo, denominator is 11/600 - 6/(5 p\u00b2).\n\nSo, putting it all together,\n\ns\u00b2 = 1 / [ 11/600 - 6/(5 p\u00b2) ].\n\nLet me write this as:\n\ns\u00b2 = 1 / [ (11 - (6 * 120)/p\u00b2 ) / 600 ] = 600 / (11 - 720/p\u00b2 ).\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait, 6/(5 p\u00b2) is equal to (6 * 120)/ (5 * 120 p\u00b2 ) = 720 / (600 p\u00b2 ). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to keep it as:\n\ns\u00b2 = 1 / [ 11/(600) - 6/(5 p\u00b2) ].\n\nLet me factor out 1/600:\n\n= 1 / [ (11 - (6 * 120)/p\u00b2 ) / 600 ]\n\nWait, because 6/(5 p\u00b2) = (6*120)/(5*120 p\u00b2) = (720)/(600 p\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\n= 1 / [ (11 - 720/p\u00b2 ) / 600 ]\n\nWhich is equal to 600 / (11 - 720/p\u00b2 ).\n\nSo,\n\ns\u00b2 = 600 / (11 - 720/p\u00b2 )\n\nBut from earlier, we have q\u00b2 = (6/5) p\u00b2 -24.\n\nSo, we can write s\u00b2 in terms of p\u00b2.\n\nBut we can also note that for s\u00b2 to be real and positive, the denominator must be positive.\n\nSo,\n\n11 - 720/p\u00b2 > 0 => 11 > 720/p\u00b2 => p\u00b2 > 720 /11.\n\nCompute 720 /11: approximately 65.4545.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 must be greater than approximately 65.4545.\n\nSimilarly, from q\u00b2 = (6/5)p\u00b2 -24, we can see that q\u00b2 must be positive.\n\nSo,\n\n(6/5) p\u00b2 -24 > 0 => p\u00b2 > (24 *5)/6 = 20.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 must be greater than 20. But the previous condition is stronger (p\u00b2 > ~65.45), so the main constraint is p\u00b2 > 720/11 \u224865.4545.\n\nSo, now, BD\u00b2 = 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2).\n\nWe need to express BD\u00b2 in terms of p\u00b2.\n\nWe have r = (-q s)/p.\n\nSo, r = (-q s)/p.\n\nSo, r\u00b2 = (q\u00b2 s\u00b2)/p\u00b2.\n\nWe have expressions for q\u00b2 and s\u00b2 in terms of p\u00b2.\n\nFrom earlier,\n\nq\u00b2 = (6/5) p\u00b2 -24,\n\nand s\u00b2 = 600 / (11 - 720/p\u00b2 ).\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 = [ (6/5 p\u00b2 -24 ) * (600 / (11 - 720/p\u00b2 )) ] / p\u00b2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nr\u00b2 = [ (6/5 p\u00b2 -24 ) * 600 ] / [ p\u00b2 (11 - 720/p\u00b2 ) ].\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: (6/5 p\u00b2 -24 ) * 600.\n\n= (6/5 p\u00b2 * 600) - (24 * 600)\n\n= (6 * 120 p\u00b2 ) - 14400\n\n= 720 p\u00b2 - 14400.\n\nDenominator: p\u00b2 (11 - 720/p\u00b2 ) = 11 p\u00b2 - 720.\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 = (720 p\u00b2 - 14400 ) / (11 p\u00b2 - 720 )\n\nWe can factor numerator:\n\n720 p\u00b2 -14400 = 720 (p\u00b2 -20).\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 = 720 (p\u00b2 -20) / (11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 (r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 )\n\n= 4 [ 720 (p\u00b2 -20)/(11 p\u00b2 -720 ) + 600/(11 -720/p\u00b2 ) ]\n\nWait, let me compute each term.\n\nWait, s\u00b2 is 600 / (11 -720/p\u00b2 )\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = [720 (p\u00b2 -20)/(11 p\u00b2 -720 ) ] + [600 / (11 -720/p\u00b2 ) ]\n\nLet me express both terms with the same denominator.\n\nNote that 11 -720/p\u00b2 = (11 p\u00b2 -720)/p\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n600 / (11 -720/p\u00b2 ) = 600 p\u00b2 / (11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = [720 (p\u00b2 -20) + 600 p\u00b2 ] / (11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n720 (p\u00b2 -20) + 600 p\u00b2 = 720 p\u00b2 -14400 + 600 p\u00b2 = (720 + 600) p\u00b2 -14400 = 1320 p\u00b2 -14400.\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = (1320 p\u00b2 -14400 ) / (11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n1320 p\u00b2 -14400 = 1320 (p\u00b2 - 14400/1320 ) = 1320 (p\u00b2 - 10.909... )\n\nWait, 14400 /1320 = 14400 \u00f7 1320 = 14400 \u00f7 (132*10) = (14400 \u00f7132)/10.\n\n14400 \u00f7132: 132*109=14388, so 14400-14388=12, so 109 +12/132=109 +1/11\u2248109.0909.\n\nSo,\n\n1320 (p\u00b2 -109.0909).\n\nBut perhaps it's better to factor 1320 as 1320=12*110=12*10*11=120*11.\n\nWait, 1320= 120*11, yes.\n\nSo,\n\n1320 p\u00b2 -14400 = 120*11 p\u00b2 -14400.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nBut let me write:\n\nr\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = (1320 p\u00b2 -14400 ) / (11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 1320 p\u00b2 -14400 = 120*(11 p\u00b2) - 14400.\n\nWait, 1320=120*11, so:\n\n=120*11 p\u00b2 -14400.\n\nDenominator: 11 p\u00b2 -720.\n\nSo, numerator can be written as 120*(11 p\u00b2) -14400.\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = [120*(11 p\u00b2) -14400 ] / (11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\n= [120*(11 p\u00b2 -720 ) +120*720 -14400 ] / (11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\nWait, let me see:\n\n120*(11 p\u00b2) -14400 =120*(11 p\u00b2 -720 +720 ) -14400\n\n=120*(11 p\u00b2 -720 ) +120*720 -14400.\n\nCompute 120*720: 120*700=84000, 120*20=2400, so total 86400.\n\nThen, 86400 -14400=72000.\n\nSo,\n\n=120*(11 p\u00b2 -720 ) +72000.\n\nThus,\n\nr\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = [120*(11 p\u00b2 -720 ) +72000 ] / (11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\n=120 + 72000 / (11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 + s\u00b2 =120 +72000/(11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2=4*(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 )=4*(120 +72000/(11 p\u00b2 -720 ))=480 + 288000/(11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =480 +288000/(11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible BD\u00b2, given that p\u00b2>720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nBut let me think about this expression.\n\nLet me denote t = p\u00b2.\n\nSo, t >720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480 +288000/(11 t -720 )\n\nWe can write 11t -720 =11(t -720/11)=11(t -65.4545).\n\nSo, as t increases, 11t -720 increases, so 288000/(11t -720 ) decreases.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above as t increases.\n\nWait, but when t approaches 720/11 from above, the denominator approaches zero, so 288000/(11t -720 ) approaches infinity. So, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity as t approaches 720/11 from above.\n\nWait, but earlier, we had the condition that p\u00b2 must be greater than 720/11\u224865.4545 for s\u00b2 to be positive.\n\nWait, so when t approaches 720/11 from above, the denominator 11t -720 approaches zero from the positive side, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut that can't be right because BD\u00b2 can't be infinite. So, perhaps my earlier reasoning is flawed.\n\nWait, but if t approaches 720/11 from above, then s\u00b2 approaches infinity because s\u00b2=600/(11 -720/t\u00b2 ) as t approaches sqrt(720/11 ). Wait, no, t is p\u00b2, so t approaches 720/11.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\ns\u00b2 =600/(11 -720/t )\n\nSo, as t approaches 720/11 from above, denominator approaches zero, so s\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSimilarly, r\u00b2 =720(t -20)/(11 t -720 )\n\nSo, as t approaches 720/11 from above, denominator approaches zero, numerator approaches 720*(720/11 -20 )=720*(720/11 -220/11 )=720*(500/11 )=360000/11\u224832727.27.\n\nSo, numerator approaches ~32727.27, denominator approaches zero, so r\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, both r\u00b2 and s\u00b2 approach infinity, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut that suggests that BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, which would imply that the supremum is infinity. But the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, which would be the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because BD\u00b2 can be as small as possible, but perhaps not.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2, but the problem says the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Wait, no, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nWait, so it's like the infimum of BD\u00b2, but the greatest number that is less than all BD\u00b2. So, it's the lower bound.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the problem is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, perhaps BD\u00b2 can get as small as possible, and the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is the infimum.\n\nWait, but in our expression, as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nFrom BD\u00b2 =480 +288000/(11 t -720 )\n\nAs t approaches infinity, 288000/(11 t -720 ) approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480.\n\nWait, so 480 is the limit as t approaches infinity.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 from above, but can't be less than 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nBecause BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this.\n\nWait, as t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n",

      "full_content": "Alright, so I've got this math problem here. It involves a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step.\n\nThe problem says: Let A, B, C, and D be points on the hyperbola (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1 such that ABCD is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. We need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the hyperbola equation is given as x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. That's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening horizontally because the positive term is with x\u00b2.\n\nA rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, I think. But wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Oh wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yeah, that's right. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at 90 degrees, and they are not equal unless it's a square.\n\nBut in this case, the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, with its diagonals crossing at the origin.\n\nSo, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and ABCD is a rhombus. So, each side is equal, and the diagonals intersect at the origin.\n\nGiven that, we need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the maximum possible BD\u00b2 is perhaps the supremum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi, and we need the greatest number less than that supremum.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's like the infimum of the suprema? Or perhaps it's the maximum lower bound for BD\u00b2. Hmm, not entirely sure, but maybe I'll get to that later.\n\nFirst, let me think about the structure of the rhombus.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, we can denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Let\u2019s say AC and BD intersect at the origin. So, the diagonals bisect each other, meaning the origin is the midpoint of both AC and BD.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, AC is perpendicular to BD. Also, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal unless it's a square, which it isn't in this case because the hyperbola is not a circle.\n\nSo, let's model this. Let\u2019s denote the coordinates of the points.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, we can denote the points as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s say point A is (p, q), then point C would be (-p, -q), since the midpoint is the origin.\n\nSimilarly, points B and D would be (r, s) and (-r, -s), respectively.\n\nSo, the four points are A(p, q), B(r, s), C(-p, -q), D(-r, -s).\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nLet me write down the vectors.\n\nVector AB is (r - p, s - q).\n\nVector BC is (-p - r, -q - s).\n\nVector CD is (-r + p, -s + q).\n\nVector DA is (p + r, q + s).\n\nWait, but since it's a rhombus, all these vectors should have the same magnitude.\n\nAlternatively, since all sides are equal, the distance between consecutive points should be equal.\n\nSo, distance AB = distance BC = distance CD = distance DA.\n\nSo, let me write the distance formula.\n\nDistance AB: sqrt[(r - p)^2 + (s - q)^2]\n\nDistance BC: sqrt[(-p - r)^2 + (-q - s)^2]\n\nSet them equal:\n\n(r - p)^2 + (s - q)^2 = (-p - r)^2 + (-q - s)^2\n\nLet me compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: (r - p)^2 + (s - q)^2 = (r\u00b2 - 2pr + p\u00b2) + (s\u00b2 - 2qs + q\u00b2)\n\nRight side: (-p - r)^2 + (-q - s)^2 = (p + r)^2 + (q + s)^2 = (p\u00b2 + 2pr + r\u00b2) + (q\u00b2 + 2qs + s\u00b2)\n\nSet them equal:\n\n(r\u00b2 - 2pr + p\u00b2 + s\u00b2 - 2qs + q\u00b2) = (p\u00b2 + 2pr + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qs + s\u00b2)\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft: p\u00b2 + r\u00b2 - 2pr + q\u00b2 + s\u00b2 - 2qs\n\nRight: p\u00b2 + r\u00b2 + 2pr + q\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + 2qs\n\nSubtract left from right:\n\n0 = 4pr + 4qs\n\nSo, 4pr + 4qs = 0 => pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, pr + qs = 0. That's one condition.\n\nSimilarly, since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular.\n\nWait, AC is from (p, q) to (-p, -q), so the vector AC is (-2p, -2q). Similarly, BD is from (r, s) to (-r, -s), so the vector BD is (-2r, -2s).\n\nWait, but the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular.\n\nSo, the dot product of AC and BD should be zero.\n\nWait, AC is ( -2p, -2q ), BD is ( -2r, -2s ).\n\nWait, actually, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, the vector AC is from A to C, which is (-2p, -2q). The vector BD is from B to D, which is (-2r, -2s).\n\nBut the diagonals are AC and BD, so their vectors are AC = C - A = (-2p, -2q) and BD = D - B = (-2r, -2s).\n\nSo, for them to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero.\n\nSo,\n\nAC \u2022 BD = (-2p)(-2r) + (-2q)(-2s) = 4pr + 4qs = 0.\n\nWait, but earlier, from the equality of sides, we had pr + qs = 0. So, 4pr + 4qs = 0 is the same condition. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, that's one condition: pr + qs = 0.\n\nAnother condition is that all four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, substituting point A: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, point B: r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, both A and B lie on the hyperbola, and due to symmetry, so do C and D.\n\nSo, we have two hyperbola equations:\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nr\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, now, the problem is to find the maximum possible BD\u00b2, but wait, the problem says to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, perhaps BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to a certain value, but never actually reaching it. So, we're looking for the supremum of BD\u00b2, but the greatest number less than that supremum would just be the supremum itself if it's attainable, but if not, it's the next lower bound.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the maximum possible value of BD\u00b2, which would be the supremum, and then if that's attainable, then it's the maximum, but if not, then the greatest number less than it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps BD\u00b2 can get as large as possible, but since the hyperbola extends to infinity, BD\u00b2 could also be as large as possible. But that doesn't make sense because the hyperbola is a hyperbola, so perhaps there's a constraint.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are related to the sides. So, maybe the diagonals can't be too long or too short.\n\nWait, let's think about the diagonals.\n\nIn a rhombus, the area can be expressed as (d1 * d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.\n\nAlso, since the sides are equal, and the diagonals are perpendicular, we can relate the sides to the diagonals.\n\nIn a rhombus, each side can be expressed in terms of the diagonals as (sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 )).\n\nSo, for our case, the side length squared is (d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2)/4.\n\nBut in our problem, all four points lie on the hyperbola, so their coordinates must satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nSo, points A(p, q) and B(r, s) are on the hyperbola, so p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1, and r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAdditionally, from the rhombus condition, we have pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, our variables are p, q, r, s, with these constraints.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2. Let's figure out BD.\n\nPoint B is (r, s), point D is (-r, -s). So, the distance BD is the distance between (r, s) and (-r, -s), which is sqrt[ ( -r - r )\u00b2 + ( -s - s )\u00b2 ] = sqrt[ (-2r)^2 + (-2s)^2 ] = sqrt[4r\u00b2 + 4s\u00b2] = 2 sqrt(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD squared is [2 sqrt(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2)]\u00b2 = 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2).\n\nSo, we need to maximize BD\u00b2, which is equivalent to maximizing (r\u00b2 + s\u00b2), given the constraints.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, perhaps the maximum BD\u00b2 is unbounded? But that can't be because points on the hyperbola can go to infinity, but in a rhombus, the points are connected, so perhaps BD\u00b2 can't be too large without violating some other condition.\n\nWait, but the hyperbola extends to infinity, so r and s could be as large as possible, making BD\u00b2 as large as possible. But that doesn't seem right because the rhombus has to satisfy all four points being on the hyperbola and the sides being equal. Maybe there's a constraint that limits how large BD can be.\n\nWait, let's think about the diagonals. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, if we have points A(p, q), B(r, s), then the diagonals are AC and BD. So, AC has length sqrt( (2p)^2 + (2q)^2 ) = 2 sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Similarly, BD has length 2 sqrt(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2).\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy the relationship: (d1)^2 + (d2)^2 = 4 * (side length)^2.\n\nBut in our case, the side length squared is (AB)^2 = (r - p)^2 + (s - q)^2.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can relate p, q, r, s in a different way.\n\nWe have the two hyperbola equations:\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nr\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAnd the condition pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, let's try to express everything in terms of p and q, or some other variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can parametrize the hyperbola.\n\nSince it's a hyperbola, we can parametrize it using hyperbolic functions.\n\nFor hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a parametrization is x = a cosh \u03b8, y = b sinh \u03b8.\n\nSo, for our hyperbola, a\u00b2 = 20, so a = 2\u221a5, and b\u00b2 = 24, so b = 2\u221a6.\n\nSo, point A can be written as (2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, point B can be written as (2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6).\n\nBut then, the condition pr + qs = 0 becomes:\n\n(2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8)(2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6) + (2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8)(2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6) = 0.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n(2\u221a5 * 2\u221a5) cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + (2\u221a6 * 2\u221a6) sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0.\n\nSo, (20) cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + (24) sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n20 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 24 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's an equation relating \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0.\n\nHmm, maybe factor this as:\n\n5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 = -6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6.\n\nDivide both sides by cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6:\n\n5 = -6 (sinh \u03b8 / cosh \u03b8) (sinh \u03c6 / cosh \u03c6).\n\nSimplify:\n\n5 = -6 tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6.\n\nSo,\n\ntanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, that's a relation between \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nSo, tanh \u03c6 = (-5)/(6 tanh \u03b8).\n\nHmm, interesting.\n\nBut perhaps we can express \u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that points A and B are on the hyperbola, and their coordinates satisfy pr + qs = 0.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of vectors.\n\nWe have points A(p, q), B(r, s).\n\nFrom the hyperbola, p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nSimilarly, r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAnd pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, the vectors (p, q) and (r, s) are such that their dot product is zero.\n\nWait, no, the dot product is pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, vectors OA and OB are perpendicular, since their dot product is zero.\n\nWait, OA is the vector from the origin to A, which is (p, q).\n\nSimilarly, OB is (r, s).\n\nSo, OA \u2022 OB = pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, OA is perpendicular to OB.\n\nThat's an important point.\n\nSo, points A and B are on the hyperbola, and the vectors OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nSo, maybe this can be used to parametrize the problem.\n\nSo, if OA is perpendicular to OB, and both points lie on the hyperbola, then we can perhaps find a relationship between their coordinates.\n\nSo, suppose OA is (p, q), then OB must satisfy pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, let's consider that.\n\nLet me think about the parametrization.\n\nSuppose OA is (p, q), then OB must be (r, s) such that pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps if OA is (p, q), then OB is proportional to (-q, p) or (q, -p), but scaled appropriately to lie on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, because if OA is (p, q), then a vector perpendicular to OA is (-q, p) or (q, -p).\n\nSo, perhaps OB is a scalar multiple of (-q, p), but scaled to lie on the hyperbola.\n\nLet me see.\n\nSuppose OB = k*(-q, p), where k is a scalar.\n\nThen, OB would be (-kq, kp).\n\nSince OB lies on the hyperbola, substituting into the equation:\n\n(-kq)^2 /20 - (kp)^2 /24 = 1.\n\nSo,\n\n(k\u00b2 q\u00b2)/20 - (k\u00b2 p\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nFactor out k\u00b2:\n\nk\u00b2 ( q\u00b2 /20 - p\u00b2 /24 ) = 1.\n\nBut from point A, we know that p\u00b2 /20 - q\u00b2 /24 = 1.\n\nWait, so q\u00b2 /20 - p\u00b2 /24 = - (p\u00b2 /20 - q\u00b2 /24 ) = -1.\n\nSo, substituting back, we have:\n\nk\u00b2 (-1) = 1 => k\u00b2 = -1.\n\nWait, that's a problem because k\u00b2 can't be negative.\n\nHmm, that suggests that this approach might not work because we end up with a negative k\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps we should take the other perpendicular direction, i.e., (q, -p).\n\nSo, suppose OB is proportional to (q, -p). So, OB = k*(q, -p).\n\nThen, OB = (kq, -kp).\n\nSubstituting into the hyperbola equation:\n\n(kq)^2 /20 - (-kp)^2 /24 = 1.\n\nSo,\n\nk\u00b2 q\u00b2 /20 - k\u00b2 p\u00b2 /24 = 1.\n\nFactor k\u00b2:\n\nk\u00b2 ( q\u00b2 /20 - p\u00b2 /24 ) = 1.\n\nAgain, q\u00b2 /20 - p\u00b2 /24 = -(p\u00b2 /20 - q\u00b2 /24 ) = -1.\n\nSo,\n\nk\u00b2 (-1) = 1 => k\u00b2 = -1.\n\nSame issue, k\u00b2 negative. Hmm.\n\nSo, this approach leads to a contradiction. Maybe because if OA is on the hyperbola, then a perpendicular vector scaled to lie on the hyperbola would require k\u00b2 to be negative, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps such a point B cannot exist unless we allow complex numbers, which we aren't.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, maybe the only way for OA and OB to be perpendicular is if the points A and B are such that the product pr + qs is zero, but without being scalar multiples of each other's perpendicular vectors.\n\nSo, perhaps we need a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that since OA and OB are perpendicular, the product pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, we can think of points A(p, q) and B(r, s) such that OA and OB are perpendicular vectors.\n\nSo, the set of points A and B lying on the hyperbola and OA perpendicular to OB.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parametrize point A as (p, q) on the hyperbola, and point B as (r, s) on the hyperbola with pr + qs = 0.\n\nWe can also note that the product pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, let me think about using Lagrange multipliers to maximize BD\u00b2 = 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2), given that r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 = 1 and pr + qs = 0.\n\nBut we also have p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nWait, but this might involve multiple variables. Maybe it's better to express r and s in terms of p and q.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize point A as (p, q) on the hyperbola, then express point B in terms of p and q, using the condition pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, for a given A(p, q), point B(r, s) must satisfy r = (-q t), s = p t, for some scalar t, because pr + qs = 0.\n\nWait, let me see. If pr + qs = 0, then for a given A(p, q), point B must satisfy r = (-q/k) s, where k is some constant.\n\nWait, perhaps more straightforwardly, since pr + qs = 0, we can express r = (-qs)/p.\n\nSo, r = (-q s)/p.\n\nThen, since B(r, s) lies on the hyperbola, we have r\u00b2 /20 - s\u00b2 /24 = 1.\n\nSubstituting r = (-q s)/p,\n\n[ (q\u00b2 s\u00b2) / p\u00b2 ] /20 - s\u00b2 /24 = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(q\u00b2 s\u00b2)/(20 p\u00b2) - s\u00b2 /24 = 1.\n\nFactor out s\u00b2:\n\ns\u00b2 [ q\u00b2/(20 p\u00b2) - 1/24 ] = 1.\n\nSo,\n\ns\u00b2 = 1 / [ q\u00b2/(20 p\u00b2) - 1/24 ].\n\nBut from point A, we have p\u00b2 /20 - q\u00b2 /24 = 1.\n\nLet me solve for q\u00b2 in terms of p\u00b2.\n\nFrom p\u00b2 /20 - q\u00b2 /24 = 1,\n\nMultiply both sides by 24*20=480:\n\n24 p\u00b2 - 20 q\u00b2 = 480.\n\nSo,\n\n24 p\u00b2 - 20 q\u00b2 = 480.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n6 p\u00b2 - 5 q\u00b2 = 120.\n\nSo, 6 p\u00b2 - 5 q\u00b2 = 120.\n\nWe can solve for q\u00b2:\n\n5 q\u00b2 = 6 p\u00b2 - 120,\n\nq\u00b2 = (6 p\u00b2 - 120)/5.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = (6/5) p\u00b2 - 24.\n\nSo, now, let's plug this back into the expression for s\u00b2.\n\ns\u00b2 = 1 / [ q\u00b2/(20 p\u00b2) - 1/24 ].\n\nSubstitute q\u00b2:\n\ns\u00b2 = 1 / [ ( (6/5 p\u00b2 - 24 ) / (20 p\u00b2) ) - 1/24 ].\n\nLet me compute the denominator:\n\nFirst term: (6/5 p\u00b2 - 24) / (20 p\u00b2) = [6/5 p\u00b2 -24]/(20 p\u00b2) = (6/(5*20)) - 24/(20 p\u00b2) = (6/100) - (24)/(20 p\u00b2) = (3/50) - (6)/(5 p\u00b2).\n\nSecond term: -1/24.\n\nSo, the denominator becomes:\n\n(3/50 - 6/(5 p\u00b2)) - 1/24.\n\nCompute this:\n\nConvert to a common denominator. Let's find a common denominator for 50, 24, and 5 p\u00b2.\n\nBut this might get messy. Alternatively, perhaps let me compute each term as fractions.\n\nCompute 3/50 - 1/24:\n\nFind a common denominator for 50 and 24, which is 600.\n\n3/50 = 36/600,\n\n1/24 = 25/600.\n\nSo,\n\n3/50 - 1/24 = (36 -25)/600 = 11/600.\n\nThen, subtract 6/(5 p\u00b2):\n\nSo, denominator is 11/600 - 6/(5 p\u00b2).\n\nSo, putting it all together,\n\ns\u00b2 = 1 / [ 11/600 - 6/(5 p\u00b2) ].\n\nLet me write this as:\n\ns\u00b2 = 1 / [ (11 - (6 * 120)/p\u00b2 ) / 600 ] = 600 / (11 - 720/p\u00b2 ).\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait, 6/(5 p\u00b2) is equal to (6 * 120)/ (5 * 120 p\u00b2 ) = 720 / (600 p\u00b2 ). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to keep it as:\n\ns\u00b2 = 1 / [ 11/(600) - 6/(5 p\u00b2) ].\n\nLet me factor out 1/600:\n\n= 1 / [ (11 - (6 * 120)/p\u00b2 ) / 600 ]\n\nWait, because 6/(5 p\u00b2) = (6*120)/(5*120 p\u00b2) = (720)/(600 p\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\n= 1 / [ (11 - 720/p\u00b2 ) / 600 ]\n\nWhich is equal to 600 / (11 - 720/p\u00b2 ).\n\nSo,\n\ns\u00b2 = 600 / (11 - 720/p\u00b2 )\n\nBut from earlier, we have q\u00b2 = (6/5) p\u00b2 -24.\n\nSo, we can write s\u00b2 in terms of p\u00b2.\n\nBut we can also note that for s\u00b2 to be real and positive, the denominator must be positive.\n\nSo,\n\n11 - 720/p\u00b2 > 0 => 11 > 720/p\u00b2 => p\u00b2 > 720 /11.\n\nCompute 720 /11: approximately 65.4545.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 must be greater than approximately 65.4545.\n\nSimilarly, from q\u00b2 = (6/5)p\u00b2 -24, we can see that q\u00b2 must be positive.\n\nSo,\n\n(6/5) p\u00b2 -24 > 0 => p\u00b2 > (24 *5)/6 = 20.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 must be greater than 20. But the previous condition is stronger (p\u00b2 > ~65.45), so the main constraint is p\u00b2 > 720/11 \u224865.4545.\n\nSo, now, BD\u00b2 = 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2).\n\nWe need to express BD\u00b2 in terms of p\u00b2.\n\nWe have r = (-q s)/p.\n\nSo, r = (-q s)/p.\n\nSo, r\u00b2 = (q\u00b2 s\u00b2)/p\u00b2.\n\nWe have expressions for q\u00b2 and s\u00b2 in terms of p\u00b2.\n\nFrom earlier,\n\nq\u00b2 = (6/5) p\u00b2 -24,\n\nand s\u00b2 = 600 / (11 - 720/p\u00b2 ).\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 = [ (6/5 p\u00b2 -24 ) * (600 / (11 - 720/p\u00b2 )) ] / p\u00b2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nr\u00b2 = [ (6/5 p\u00b2 -24 ) * 600 ] / [ p\u00b2 (11 - 720/p\u00b2 ) ].\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: (6/5 p\u00b2 -24 ) * 600.\n\n= (6/5 p\u00b2 * 600) - (24 * 600)\n\n= (6 * 120 p\u00b2 ) - 14400\n\n= 720 p\u00b2 - 14400.\n\nDenominator: p\u00b2 (11 - 720/p\u00b2 ) = 11 p\u00b2 - 720.\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 = (720 p\u00b2 - 14400 ) / (11 p\u00b2 - 720 )\n\nWe can factor numerator:\n\n720 p\u00b2 -14400 = 720 (p\u00b2 -20).\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 = 720 (p\u00b2 -20) / (11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 (r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 )\n\n= 4 [ 720 (p\u00b2 -20)/(11 p\u00b2 -720 ) + 600/(11 -720/p\u00b2 ) ]\n\nWait, let me compute each term.\n\nWait, s\u00b2 is 600 / (11 -720/p\u00b2 )\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = [720 (p\u00b2 -20)/(11 p\u00b2 -720 ) ] + [600 / (11 -720/p\u00b2 ) ]\n\nLet me express both terms with the same denominator.\n\nNote that 11 -720/p\u00b2 = (11 p\u00b2 -720)/p\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n600 / (11 -720/p\u00b2 ) = 600 p\u00b2 / (11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = [720 (p\u00b2 -20) + 600 p\u00b2 ] / (11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n720 (p\u00b2 -20) + 600 p\u00b2 = 720 p\u00b2 -14400 + 600 p\u00b2 = (720 + 600) p\u00b2 -14400 = 1320 p\u00b2 -14400.\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = (1320 p\u00b2 -14400 ) / (11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n1320 p\u00b2 -14400 = 1320 (p\u00b2 - 14400/1320 ) = 1320 (p\u00b2 - 10.909... )\n\nWait, 14400 /1320 = 14400 \u00f7 1320 = 14400 \u00f7 (132*10) = (14400 \u00f7132)/10.\n\n14400 \u00f7132: 132*109=14388, so 14400-14388=12, so 109 +12/132=109 +1/11\u2248109.0909.\n\nSo,\n\n1320 (p\u00b2 -109.0909).\n\nBut perhaps it's better to factor 1320 as 1320=12*110=12*10*11=120*11.\n\nWait, 1320= 120*11, yes.\n\nSo,\n\n1320 p\u00b2 -14400 = 120*11 p\u00b2 -14400.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nBut let me write:\n\nr\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = (1320 p\u00b2 -14400 ) / (11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 1320 p\u00b2 -14400 = 120*(11 p\u00b2) - 14400.\n\nWait, 1320=120*11, so:\n\n=120*11 p\u00b2 -14400.\n\nDenominator: 11 p\u00b2 -720.\n\nSo, numerator can be written as 120*(11 p\u00b2) -14400.\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = [120*(11 p\u00b2) -14400 ] / (11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\n= [120*(11 p\u00b2 -720 ) +120*720 -14400 ] / (11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\nWait, let me see:\n\n120*(11 p\u00b2) -14400 =120*(11 p\u00b2 -720 +720 ) -14400\n\n=120*(11 p\u00b2 -720 ) +120*720 -14400.\n\nCompute 120*720: 120*700=84000, 120*20=2400, so total 86400.\n\nThen, 86400 -14400=72000.\n\nSo,\n\n=120*(11 p\u00b2 -720 ) +72000.\n\nThus,\n\nr\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = [120*(11 p\u00b2 -720 ) +72000 ] / (11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\n=120 + 72000 / (11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\nSo,\n\nr\u00b2 + s\u00b2 =120 +72000/(11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2=4*(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 )=4*(120 +72000/(11 p\u00b2 -720 ))=480 + 288000/(11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =480 +288000/(11 p\u00b2 -720 )\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible BD\u00b2, given that p\u00b2>720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nBut let me think about this expression.\n\nLet me denote t = p\u00b2.\n\nSo, t >720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480 +288000/(11 t -720 )\n\nWe can write 11t -720 =11(t -720/11)=11(t -65.4545).\n\nSo, as t increases, 11t -720 increases, so 288000/(11t -720 ) decreases.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above as t increases.\n\nWait, but when t approaches 720/11 from above, the denominator approaches zero, so 288000/(11t -720 ) approaches infinity. So, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity as t approaches 720/11 from above.\n\nWait, but earlier, we had the condition that p\u00b2 must be greater than 720/11\u224865.4545 for s\u00b2 to be positive.\n\nWait, so when t approaches 720/11 from above, the denominator 11t -720 approaches zero from the positive side, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut that can't be right because BD\u00b2 can't be infinite. So, perhaps my earlier reasoning is flawed.\n\nWait, but if t approaches 720/11 from above, then s\u00b2 approaches infinity because s\u00b2=600/(11 -720/t\u00b2 ) as t approaches sqrt(720/11 ). Wait, no, t is p\u00b2, so t approaches 720/11.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\ns\u00b2 =600/(11 -720/t )\n\nSo, as t approaches 720/11 from above, denominator approaches zero, so s\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSimilarly, r\u00b2 =720(t -20)/(11 t -720 )\n\nSo, as t approaches 720/11 from above, denominator approaches zero, numerator approaches 720*(720/11 -20 )=720*(720/11 -220/11 )=720*(500/11 )=360000/11\u224832727.27.\n\nSo, numerator approaches ~32727.27, denominator approaches zero, so r\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, both r\u00b2 and s\u00b2 approach infinity, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut that suggests that BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, which would imply that the supremum is infinity. But the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, which would be the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because BD\u00b2 can be as small as possible, but perhaps not.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2, but the problem says the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Wait, no, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nWait, so it's like the infimum of BD\u00b2, but the greatest number that is less than all BD\u00b2. So, it's the lower bound.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the problem is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, perhaps BD\u00b2 can get as small as possible, and the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is the infimum.\n\nWait, but in our expression, as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nFrom BD\u00b2 =480 +288000/(11 t -720 )\n\nAs t approaches infinity, 288000/(11 t -720 ) approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480.\n\nWait, so 480 is the limit as t approaches infinity.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 from above, but can't be less than 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nBecause BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this.\n\nWait, as t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the given hyperbola and the properties of the rhombus. The hyperbola is given by \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\), and the rhombus \\(ABCD\\) has its diagonals intersecting at the origin.

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the dot product condition gives \\(pr + qs = 0\\). Additionally, all points satisfy the hyperbola equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{p^2}{20} - \\frac{q^2}{24} = 1, \\quad \\frac{r^2}{20} - \\frac{s^2}{24} = 1.\n\\]\n\nThe length of diagonal \\(BD\\) is calculated as:\n\\[\nBD^2 = 4(r^2 + s^2).\n\\]\n\nUsing the constraints and parametrization, we find that \\(BD^2\\) approaches a limit as the parameter \\(t = p^2\\) increases. Through detailed analysis, we determine that:\n\\[\nBD^2 = 480 + \\frac{288000}{11p^2 - 720}.\n\\]\nAs \\(p^2\\) grows large, \\(BD^2\\) approaches 480 from above. Therefore, the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is \\(\\boxed{480}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on a hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal and its diagonals bisecting each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Oh, wait, no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Hmm, no, actually, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me clarify: in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Yes, that's correct. So they are perpendicular. So, in this problem, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, and they are perpendicular.\n\nGiven that the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, which is a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening along the x-axis. The asymptotes are y = \u00b1(sqrt(24)/sqrt(20))x, which simplifies to y = \u00b1(2*sqrt(6)/2*sqrt(5))x = \u00b1(sqrt(6)/sqrt(5))x. So approximately, that's about \u00b11.095x. Not sure if that's immediately useful, but good to note.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. Also, the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the points A, B, C, D are such that each pair of opposite points are symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D would be symmetric with respect to the origin as well. So, if point B is (p, q), then point D is (-p, -q).\n\nWait, so the rhombus is formed by four points: A, B, C, D, with A and C being opposites, B and D being opposites. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin. Since diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nSo, let's think about parametrizing the points A, B, C, D.\n\nSince all points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, any point on the hyperbola can be written as (x, y) where x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nLet me consider points A and C as (x, y) and (-x, -y), and points B and D as (p, q) and (-p, -q). Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, which equals the distance from C to D, which equals the distance from D to A.\n\nAlternatively, since the sides are equal, the vectors representing the sides should have the same magnitude. Let's think in terms of vectors.\n\nLet me denote vectors AB, BC, CD, DA. Each of these vectors should have the same magnitude. Let's express these vectors in terms of coordinates.\n\nVector AB is (p - x, q - y).\n\nVector BC is (-x - p, -y - q).\n\nVector CD is (-p - (-x), -q - (-y)) = (x - p, y - q).\n\nVector DA is (x - (-p), y - (-q)) = (x + p, y + q).\n\nWait, this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nSince the diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular, their slopes should multiply to -1. Let's compute the slopes of AC and BD.\n\nSlope of AC: Since A is (x, y) and C is (-x, -y), the slope is ( -y - y ) / ( -x - x ) = (-2y)/(-2x) = y/x.\n\nSimilarly, slope of BD: Points B (p, q) and D (-p, -q). Slope is (-q - q)/(-p - p) = (-2q)/(-2p) = q/p.\n\nSince diagonals are perpendicular, (y/x)*(q/p) = -1. So, (yq)/(xp) = -1. Therefore, yq = -xp.\n\nSo, we have the condition yq = -xp. That's one equation.\n\nAnother condition is that all four points lie on the hyperbola, so for points A and C: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, and similarly for B and D: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD.\n\nDiagonal BD goes from point B (p, q) to D (-p, -q). So, the distance between B and D is sqrt[ (-p - p)^2 + (-q - q)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-2p)^2 + (-2q)^2 ] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Therefore, BD\u00b2 is (2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, we need to find the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2, or more precisely, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of the lower bounds, essentially the infimum of BD\u00b2, but phrased differently. So, the maximum of the lower bounds. So, the minimal possible BD\u00b2, and then the greatest number less than that is the infimum.\n\nWait, maybe it's the opposite. Wait, let me read the question again: \"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, we're looking for a number L such that L < BD\u00b2 for every possible rhombus, and L is as large as possible. So, L is the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all such rhombi. So, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is the infimum, and L is that.\n\nSo, perhaps we need to find the minimal BD\u00b2 possible, given the constraints, and then the answer is that minimal BD\u00b2, but the problem says the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, if L is the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, then L must be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to the infimum from above. So, L is the infimum.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal possible value of BD\u00b2, which is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), given the constraints that points A(x, y) and B(p, q) lie on the hyperbola, and satisfy yq = -xp.\n\nSo, now, let's write down all the equations we have:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 (Equation for point A)\n2. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1 (Equation for point B)\n3. yq = -xp (From the slopes being perpendicular)\n\nOur variables are x, y, p, q. We need to express BD\u00b2 in terms of these variables and find its minimum.\n\nBut since we have four variables and three equations, perhaps we can express some variables in terms of others.\n\nLet me try to express q in terms of p, x, y. From equation 3: yq = -xp => q = (-xp)/y.\n\nSo, substitute q into equation 2: p\u00b2/20 - [(-xp/y)\u00b2]/24 = 1.\n\nSimplify that:\n\np\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(y\u00b2 * 24) = 1.\n\nFactor out p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [1/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2)] = 1.\n\nLet me compute the term in brackets:\n\n1/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2).\n\nBut from equation 1, we know x\u00b2/20 = 1 + y\u00b2/24. So, x\u00b2 = 20(1 + y\u00b2/24) = 20 + (20 y\u00b2)/24 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSubstitute this into the term in brackets:\n\n1/20 - [ (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / (24 y\u00b2) ) ].\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 = (120 + 5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, denominator is 24 y\u00b2.\n\nSo, the term becomes:\n\n1/20 - [ (120 + 5 y\u00b2) / (6 * 24 y\u00b2) ) ] = 1/20 - [ (120 + 5 y\u00b2) / (144 y\u00b2) ) ].\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\n(120 + 5 y\u00b2) / (144 y\u00b2) = (120)/(144 y\u00b2) + (5 y\u00b2)/(144 y\u00b2) = (5/6 y\u00b2) + (5/144).\n\nWait, let me compute 120 / 144 = 5/6, and 5 y\u00b2 / 144 y\u00b2 = 5/144.\n\nSo, the term is 1/20 - (5/(6 y\u00b2) + 5/144).\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, no, let's re-express:\n\nWait, 120 + 5 y\u00b2 over 144 y\u00b2 is equal to (120)/(144 y\u00b2) + (5 y\u00b2)/(144 y\u00b2) = (5/6 y\u00b2) + (5/144). Hmm, actually, 120/144 is 5/6, but it's 120/(144 y\u00b2) which is (5)/(6 y\u00b2). Similarly, 5 y\u00b2 / 144 y\u00b2 is 5/144. So, the term is (5)/(6 y\u00b2) + 5/144.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the term in brackets is:\n\n1/20 - [ (5)/(6 y\u00b2) + 5/144 ].\n\nSo, let's write this as:\n\n1/20 - 5/(6 y\u00b2) - 5/144.\n\nNow, let's combine the constants:\n\n1/20 - 5/144 = (144 - 100)/(20*144) )? Wait, 1/20 is 7.2/144, 5/144 is 5/144. So, 7.2/144 - 5/144 = 2.2/144 = 11/720. Hmm, perhaps better to compute exact fractions.\n\nCompute 1/20 - 5/144:\n\nFind a common denominator, which is 360.\n\n1/20 = 18/360, 5/144 = 12.5/360. Wait, but 5/144 = (5 * 2.5)/360? Wait, maybe another approach.\n\nWait, 1/20 = 9/180, 5/144 = 25/720. So, convert to 720 denominator:\n\n1/20 = 36/720, 5/144 = 25/720.\n\nSo, 36/720 - 25/720 = 11/720.\n\nSo, 1/20 -5/144=11/720.\n\nSo, the term in brackets becomes:\n\n11/720 - 5/(6 y\u00b2).\n\nSo, going back to equation 2:\n\np\u00b2 [ 11/720 - 5/(6 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 1 / [11/720 - 5/(6 y\u00b2)].\n\nLet me write that as:\n\np\u00b2 = 1 / [ (11 - 60/(y\u00b2)) / 720 ] = 720 / (11 - 60/(y\u00b2)).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 720 / (11 - 60/(y\u00b2)).\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe we can express this differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express BD\u00b2 in terms of y\u00b2.\n\nRecall that BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nFrom equation 3: q = (-x p)/y.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/y\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/y\u00b2) = 4 p\u00b2 (1 + x\u00b2 / y\u00b2).\n\nFrom equation 1: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 => x\u00b2 = 20(1 + y\u00b2/24) = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 / y\u00b2 = 20 / y\u00b2 + 5/6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 p\u00b2 [1 + 20 / y\u00b2 + 5/6 ] = 4 p\u00b2 [ (6 + 20/y\u00b2 + 5)/6 ].\n\nWait, that might not be the most straightforward way. Let me compute 1 + x\u00b2/y\u00b2:\n\n1 + x\u00b2/y\u00b2 = 1 + (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / y\u00b2 = 1 + 20 / y\u00b2 + (5 y\u00b2)/(6 y\u00b2) = 1 + 20 / y\u00b2 + 5/6.\n\nSo, 1 + 20 / y\u00b2 + 5/6 = (6 + 5)/6 + 20 / y\u00b2 = 11/6 + 20 / y\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 p\u00b2 (11/6 + 20 / y\u00b2 ).\n\nBut from earlier, we have p\u00b2 = 720 / (11 - 60 / y\u00b2 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 * [720 / (11 - 60 / y\u00b2 ) ] * (11/6 + 20 / y\u00b2 ).\n\nLet me compute this expression:\n\nFirst, compute 4 * 720 = 2880.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 2880 * [ (11/6 + 20 / y\u00b2 ) / (11 - 60 / y\u00b2 ) ].\n\nLet me let t = 1/y\u00b2. Then, since y\u00b2 is positive (as it's on the hyperbola), t is positive.\n\nSo, substitute t:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 2880 * [ (11/6 + 20 t ) / (11 - 60 t ) ].\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 2880 * [ (11/6 + 20 t ) / (11 - 60 t ) ].\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 2880 * ( (11/6 + 20 t) / (11 - 60 t) ).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 11/6 + 20 t = (11 + 120 t)/6.\n\nDenominator: 11 - 60 t.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 2880 * [ (11 + 120 t)/6 ] / (11 - 60 t ) = 2880 * (11 + 120 t) / [6(11 - 60 t)].\n\nSimplify 2880 / 6 = 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480 * (11 + 120 t) / (11 - 60 t).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480 * [ (11 + 120 t) / (11 - 60 t) ].\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480 * [ (11 + 120 t) / (11 - 60 t) ].\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 11 + 120 t = 11 + 120 t.\n\nDenominator: 11 - 60 t.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor out 11 in numerator and denominator? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, write it as:\n\n(11 + 120 t) / (11 - 60 t) = [ 11(1) + 120 t ] / [ 11(1) - 60 t ].\n\nLet me think of this as a function f(t) = (11 + 120 t)/(11 - 60 t), and I need to find the minimum of BD\u00b2 = 480 f(t).\n\nBut wait, actually, since BD\u00b2 is proportional to f(t), and we have constraints on t.\n\nBut what is the domain of t?\n\nt = 1/y\u00b2, and since point A is on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, so y\u00b2 must be positive, so t is positive.\n\nMoreover, from equation 3: yq = -xp.\n\nWe can have both positive and negative coordinates, but since we're dealing with squares, perhaps the sign isn't important.\n\nBut for the denominator 11 - 60 t in f(t), we must have 11 - 60 t > 0, because p\u00b2 must be positive, as it's a square.\n\nSo, 11 - 60 t > 0 => t < 11/60 \u2248 0.1833.\n\nAlso, t must be positive, so t \u2208 (0, 11/60).\n\nSo, t is between 0 and 11/60.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimum of BD\u00b2 = 480*(11 + 120 t)/(11 - 60 t) over t \u2208 (0, 11/60).\n\nTo find the minimum, let's analyze the function f(t) = (11 + 120 t)/(11 - 60 t).\n\nCompute derivative of f(t) with respect to t:\n\nf(t) = (11 + 120 t)/(11 - 60 t).\n\nf'(t) = [ (120)(11 - 60 t) - (11 + 120 t)(-60) ] / (11 - 60 t)^2.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n120*(11 - 60t) + 60*(11 + 120t) =\n\n120*11 - 120*60 t + 60*11 + 60*120 t.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n120*11 = 1320.\n\n-120*60 t = -7200 t.\n\n60*11 = 660.\n\n60*120 t = 7200 t.\n\nSo, adding together:\n\n1320 + 660 + (-7200 t + 7200 t) = 1980 + 0 = 1980.\n\nSo, f'(t) = 1980 / (11 - 60 t)^2.\n\nSince the denominator is always positive for t < 11/60, and numerator is positive, f'(t) is always positive. So, f(t) is increasing on t \u2208 (0, 11/60).\n\nTherefore, the minimum of f(t) occurs at t approaching 0, and the maximum as t approaches 11/60.\n\nBut wait, BD\u00b2 is 480*f(t), so BD\u00b2 is also increasing with t.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs at t approaching 0.\n\nBut wait, t approaches 0 from the positive side. So, as t approaches 0, f(t) approaches (11 + 0)/(11 - 0) = 1.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480*1 = 480.\n\nBut wait, t=0 is not allowed because then y would be infinite, which isn't possible. So, BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480 but can't actually reach it.\n\nWait, but let me check: when t approaches 0, what happens to points A and B?\n\nIf t =1/y\u00b2 approaches 0, then y\u00b2 approaches infinity. So, point A is (x, y) where y is very large. From hyperbola equation, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6. So, x\u00b2 approaches (5/6)y\u00b2 as y\u00b2 becomes large. So, x is approximately \u00b1sqrt(5/6) y.\n\nSimilarly, point B is (p, q) where p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nFrom equation 3: q = (-x p)/y.\n\nAs y approaches infinity, q approaches 0 (since x ~ sqrt(5/6) y, so x p / y ~ sqrt(5/6) p). So, q ~ -sqrt(5/6) p.\n\nBut from hyperbola equation for point B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSubstitute q ~ -sqrt(5/6) p:\n\np\u00b2/20 - (5/6 p\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nCompute:\n\np\u00b2/20 - (5 p\u00b2)/(6*24) = p\u00b2/20 - (5 p\u00b2)/144.\n\nConvert to common denominator:\n\n(7.2 p\u00b2 - 5 p\u00b2)/144 = (2.2 p\u00b2)/144 = (11 p\u00b2)/720.\n\nSo, (11 p\u00b2)/720 =1 => p\u00b2 = 720/11 => p = \u00b1sqrt(720/11).\n\nSo, as t approaches 0, p approaches sqrt(720/11). So, p\u00b2 approaches 720/11 \u224865.4545.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2 =4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) =4( p\u00b2 + (5/6 p\u00b2) ) =4( (11/6)p\u00b2 )= (44/6) p\u00b2= (22/3)p\u00b2.\n\nWait, but p\u00b2 =720/11, so BD\u00b2= (22/3)*(720/11)= (22*720)/(3*11)= (22/11)*(720/3)=2*(240)=480.\n\nSo, as t approaches 0, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut wait, when t approaches 0, the rhombus becomes very \"stretched\" along the y-axis, with points A and C approaching (\u00b1sqrt(5/6) y, \u00b1y) as y approaches infinity. Points B and D approach fixed points (\u00b1sqrt(720/11), 0), since q approaches zero. So, the rhombus becomes almost like a very tall and thin diamond with two points at infinity and two points fixed on the x-axis.\n\nBut BD is the distance between B and D, which in the limit is 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), but as q approaches zero, BD approaches 2p, so BD\u00b2 approaches 4p\u00b2=4*(720/11)= 2880/11\u2248261.818, which contradicts our earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, that's a problem. There must be a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, let's double-check.\n\nEarlier, I thought that as t approaches 0, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, but when I considered the limit with points approaching infinity, it suggests BD\u00b2 approaches 2880/11\u2248261.818.\n\nWait, that's a discrepancy. So, which one is correct?\n\nLet me go back.\n\nWait, I think I messed up when I substituted q ~ -sqrt(5/6) p into the hyperbola equation for point B.\n\nWait, q = (-x p)/y.\n\nBut as y approaches infinity, x ~ sqrt(5/6) y, so q ~ (-sqrt(5/6) y p)/y = -sqrt(5/6) p.\n\nSo, q ~ -sqrt(5/6) p.\n\nSo, plugging into the hyperbola equation:\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2/20 - ( (5/6 p\u00b2 ) ) /24 =1.\n\nWhich is p\u00b2/20 - (5 p\u00b2)/(6*24)= p\u00b2/20 -5 p\u00b2/144.\n\nWhich is equal to (7.2 p\u00b2 -5 p\u00b2)/144 = 2.2 p\u00b2 /144 = (11 p\u00b2)/720=1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2=720/11.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 is fixed as 720/11, so p is \u00b1sqrt(720/11).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)=4(p\u00b2 + (5/6 p\u00b2))=4*(11/6 p\u00b2)= (44/6)p\u00b2= (22/3)p\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=(22/3)*(720/11)= (22*720)/(3*11)= (22/11)*(720/3)=2*240=480.\n\nSo, that's consistent with the earlier conclusion.\n\nBut earlier, I thought BD approaches 2p, but that was incorrect because q doesn't approach zero; rather, q approaches -sqrt(5/6) p, which is a constant multiple of p. So, q\u00b2 is (5/6)p\u00b2, so BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)=4(p\u00b2 +5/6 p\u00b2)=4*(11/6 p\u00b2)= (44/6)p\u00b2= (22/3)p\u00b2, which is 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as t approaches 0.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I thought BD approaches 2p, that was wrong because q isn't approaching zero; it's approaching a fixed multiple of p. So, BD\u00b2 is indeed approaching 480.\n\nBut then, is 480 the minimal value of BD\u00b2? Because BD\u00b2 is increasing as t increases, approaching t=11/60, which would make denominator zero, but t can't reach 11/60 because p\u00b2 would blow up.\n\nWait, but in reality, as t approaches 11/60 from below, the denominator 11 -60 t approaches zero, so p\u00b2 approaches infinity, so BD\u00b2 would also approach infinity.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be as large as we want, but it approaches 480 from above as t approaches 0. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, approached as the rhombus becomes very \"stretched\" along the y-axis.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480, but never less than 480, then 480 is the infimum. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, but since BD\u00b2 can't be less than 480, the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480 in the limit, but can it actually attain 480? No, because t=0 is not allowed (as y would be infinite). So, BD\u00b2 can approach 480 but never actually reaches it. Therefore, the infimum is 480, but it's not attained. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, then 480 is the infimum, but the question is asking for the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Hmm, but if BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as desired, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480 itself, because for any number greater than 480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 less than that number. Wait, no, that's the opposite.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nIf the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, then BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480. So, for any L < 480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < L? No, that's not correct. Wait, no, the infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, BD\u00b2 is always \u2265 480, so 480 is the minimal value of BD\u00b2, approached as t approaches 0.\n\nTherefore, for any L < 480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < L? No, that can't be, because BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480.\n\nWait, actually, if the infimum is 480, that means BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as we like, but never goes below 480. So, 480 is the greatest lower bound. So, the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480, so 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But the question says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, 480 is the infimum, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480. Because any number greater than 480 would not be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, since BD\u00b2 can be as close to 480 as we want.\n\nWait, but 480 is the infimum, so BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 from above. So, for any \u03b5 >0, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < 480 + \u03b5. But for any number L <480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < L? No, because BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480, so for L <480, there are no rhombi with BD\u00b2 < L. So, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because 480 \u2264 BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, so 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2, but for any number greater than 480, say 480 + \u03b5, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < 480 + \u03b5. But the problem is asking for the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, that would be 480, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480. So, 480 is the greatest lower bound, so the answer is 480.\n\nBut let me think again: if BD\u00b2 can approach 480, but never be less than 480, then 480 is the infimum, and any number less than 480 is also less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But the question is asking for the greatest such number. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because it's the infimum.\n\nWait, but 480 is not less than BD\u00b2; it's equal to the infimum. Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me read the question again: \"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the number must be less than BD\u00b2 for every rhombus. So, the number must be a lower bound for BD\u00b2. The greatest such lower bound is the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 480.\n\nBut if BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480, then 480 is the greatest lower bound. So, any number greater than 480 is not a lower bound because there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 =480 + \u03b5. But 480 is the greatest number that is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nWait, but the question says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's looking for a number L such that L < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. The greatest such L is the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because for any L less than the infimum, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 less than L. So, the greatest L such that L < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the infimum.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. If the infimum is 480, then for any L <480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < L. So, L cannot be greater than 480 because then there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 between 480 and L, which would violate L < BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, but can be larger. So, the set of possible BD\u00b2 is [480, \u221e). So, the question is asking for the greatest number L such that L < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. That would be L=480, because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, so L=480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But the question says \"less than BD\u00b2.\" So, if L=480, is 480 < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi? No, because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480 in the limit, but never actually less than 480. So, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480.\n\nWait, but in reality, BD\u00b2 can't actually be 480 because that would require t=0, which isn't allowed as it would make y infinite. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480. So, 480 is the infimum, and BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480 from above. So, for any \u03b5>0, there's a rhombus with BD\u00b2 <480 + \u03b5. But for any L <480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < L? No, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480.\n\nWait, no. If BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, then for any L <480, there's no rhombus with BD\u00b2 < L. So, the set of lower bounds for BD\u00b2 is (-\u221e,480]. But the question is asking for the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, that number must be less than BD\u00b2 for every rhombus. Since BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, any number less than 480 would not satisfy the condition because you can have BD\u00b2 as close to 480 as you want. So, the only number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480 itself, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480.\n\nWait, but 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480. So, perhaps the answer is 480, but phrased as the infimum.\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled here. Let me try to think differently.\n\nIf the infimum is 480, then for any \u03b5>0, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 <480 + \u03b5. So, the greatest number L such that L < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi must be L=480, because if you take L=480 + \u03b5 for any \u03b5>0, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < L. But if you take L=480, then for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 >480, so 480 < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But wait, no, in reality, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, so there are rhombi with BD\u00b2 as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480.\n\nWait, no, if BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above, then BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480. So, 480 is the infimum, and BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480. Therefore, 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because for any number greater than 480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 between 480 and that number. But for 480 itself, BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480, so 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, then 480 is not less than BD\u00b2, it's equal. So, perhaps the answer is 480, but phrased as the infimum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal BD\u00b2 is 2880/11, which is approximately 261.818. Wait, where did I get that number earlier?\n\nWait, when I thought about BD approaching 2p, but that was a mistake because q doesn't approach zero but a fixed multiple of p.\n\nWait, let me compute BD\u00b2 when t approaches 11/60. Wait, t=1/y\u00b2 approaches 11/60, so y\u00b2 approaches 60/11.\n\nThen, from equation 1: x\u00b2 =20 +5 y\u00b2 /6=20 +5*(60/11)/6=20 +5*(10/11)=20 +50/11= (220 +50)/11=270/11.\n\nSo, x\u00b2=270/11, y\u00b2=60/11.\n\nFrom equation 3: q= -x p / y.\n\nSo, q= - (sqrt(270/11) p)/sqrt(60/11)= - sqrt(270/11 /60/11) p= -sqrt(270/60) p= -sqrt(4.5) p= - (3 sqrt(0.5)) p= - (3/\u221a2) p.\n\nSo, q= -3/\u221a2 p.\n\nThen, from equation 2: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSubstitute q:\n\np\u00b2/20 - ( (9/2)p\u00b2 ) /24=1.\n\nSimplify:\n\np\u00b2/20 - (9 p\u00b2)/(48)=1.\n\nConvert to common denominator:\n\n(12 p\u00b2 - 15 p\u00b2)/120= (-3 p\u00b2)/120= -p\u00b2/40=1.\n\nWhich implies p\u00b2= -40, which is impossible. So, that can't be.\n\nWait, that suggests that when t approaches 11/60, p\u00b2 becomes negative, which is impossible. So, that's a contradiction. Therefore, t cannot approach 11/60 from below because it would require p\u00b2 to be negative, which is impossible. So, perhaps my earlier assumption that BD\u00b2 can approach 480 is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the derivative earlier. Let me re-examine.\n\nWe had BD\u00b2=480*(11 + 120 t)/(11 -60 t).\n\nWe found that f(t)=(11 +120 t)/(11 -60 t) is increasing on t \u2208 (0,11/60).\n\nBut when t approaches 11/60, denominator approaches zero, so f(t) approaches infinity. So, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut when t approaches 0, f(t) approaches 11/11=1, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480*1=480.\n\nBut when t approaches some other value?\n\nWait, but when t approaches 11/60, p\u00b2 approaches infinity, which is not possible because p\u00b2 must satisfy p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24=1, and q is related to p via q= -x p / y.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a maximum value of t beyond which p\u00b2 becomes negative, which is impossible. So, the domain of t is such that 11 -60 t>0, so t<11/60, but also, from equation 3 and the hyperbola equation for point B, p\u00b2 must be positive.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the substitution.\n\nWe had p\u00b2=720/(11 -60 t).\n\nSo, for p\u00b2 to be positive, denominator must be positive, so 11 -60 t>0 => t<11/60.\n\nSo, t can go up to, but not including, 11/60.\n\nBut when t approaches 11/60, p\u00b2 approaches infinity, which would require q to approach -sqrt(5/6) p, which is also approaching infinity.\n\nSo, as t approaches 11/60, points B and D go to infinity along the line q= -sqrt(5/6)p.\n\nBut that's acceptable because points can be anywhere on the hyperbola.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried substituting t=11/60, I got p\u00b2= -40, which is impossible, but that's because at t=11/60, the denominator becomes zero, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, t can approach 11/60, making p\u00b2 approach infinity, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(11 +120 t)/(11 -60 t).\n\nSince f(t) is increasing, BD\u00b2 increases from 480 to infinity as t increases from 0 to 11/60.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 has a minimum value of 480, approached as t approaches 0, and can be made arbitrarily large as t approaches 11/60.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, which is the infimum. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nBut wait, BD\u00b2 cannot be less than 480 because as t approaches 0, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, so 480 is the infimum.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on a hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal and its diagonals bisecting each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Oh, wait, no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Hmm, no, actually, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me clarify: in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Yes, that's correct. So they are perpendicular. So, in this problem, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, and they are perpendicular.\n\nGiven that the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, which is a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening along the x-axis. The asymptotes are y = \u00b1(sqrt(24)/sqrt(20))x, which simplifies to y = \u00b1(2*sqrt(6)/2*sqrt(5))x = \u00b1(sqrt(6)/sqrt(5))x. So approximately, that's about \u00b11.095x. Not sure if that's immediately useful, but good to note.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. Also, the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the points A, B, C, D are such that each pair of opposite points are symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D would be symmetric with respect to the origin as well. So, if point B is (p, q), then point D is (-p, -q).\n\nWait, so the rhombus is formed by four points: A, B, C, D, with A and C being opposites, B and D being opposites. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin. Since diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nSo, let's think about parametrizing the points A, B, C, D.\n\nSince all points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, any point on the hyperbola can be written as (x, y) where x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nLet me consider points A and C as (x, y) and (-x, -y), and points B and D as (p, q) and (-p, -q). Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, which equals the distance from C to D, which equals the distance from D to A.\n\nAlternatively, since the sides are equal, the vectors representing the sides should have the same magnitude. Let's think in terms of vectors.\n\nLet me denote vectors AB, BC, CD, DA. Each of these vectors should have the same magnitude. Let's express these vectors in terms of coordinates.\n\nVector AB is (p - x, q - y).\n\nVector BC is (-x - p, -y - q).\n\nVector CD is (-p - (-x), -q - (-y)) = (x - p, y - q).\n\nVector DA is (x - (-p), y - (-q)) = (x + p, y + q).\n\nWait, this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nSince the diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular, their slopes should multiply to -1. Let's compute the slopes of AC and BD.\n\nSlope of AC: Since A is (x, y) and C is (-x, -y), the slope is ( -y - y ) / ( -x - x ) = (-2y)/(-2x) = y/x.\n\nSimilarly, slope of BD: Points B (p, q) and D (-p, -q). Slope is (-q - q)/(-p - p) = (-2q)/(-2p) = q/p.\n\nSince diagonals are perpendicular, (y/x)*(q/p) = -1. So, (yq)/(xp) = -1. Therefore, yq = -xp.\n\nSo, we have the condition yq = -xp. That's one equation.\n\nAnother condition is that all four points lie on the hyperbola, so for points A and C: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, and similarly for B and D: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD.\n\nDiagonal BD goes from point B (p, q) to D (-p, -q). So, the distance between B and D is sqrt[ (-p - p)^2 + (-q - q)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-2p)^2 + (-2q)^2 ] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Therefore, BD\u00b2 is (2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, we need to find the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2, or more precisely, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of the lower bounds, essentially the infimum of BD\u00b2, but phrased differently. So, the maximum of the lower bounds. So, the minimal possible BD\u00b2, and then the greatest number less than that is the infimum.\n\nWait, maybe it's the opposite. Wait, let me read the question again: \"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, we're looking for a number L such that L < BD\u00b2 for every possible rhombus, and L is as large as possible. So, L is the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all such rhombi. So, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is the infimum, and L is that.\n\nSo, perhaps we need to find the minimal BD\u00b2 possible, given the constraints, and then the answer is that minimal BD\u00b2, but the problem says the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, if L is the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, then L must be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to the infimum from above. So, L is the infimum.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal possible value of BD\u00b2, which is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), given the constraints that points A(x, y) and B(p, q) lie on the hyperbola, and satisfy yq = -xp.\n\nSo, now, let's write down all the equations we have:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 (Equation for point A)\n2. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1 (Equation for point B)\n3. yq = -xp (From the slopes being perpendicular)\n\nOur variables are x, y, p, q. We need to express BD\u00b2 in terms of these variables and find its minimum.\n\nBut since we have four variables and three equations, perhaps we can express some variables in terms of others.\n\nLet me try to express q in terms of p, x, y. From equation 3: yq = -xp => q = (-xp)/y.\n\nSo, substitute q into equation 2: p\u00b2/20 - [(-xp/y)\u00b2]/24 = 1.\n\nSimplify that:\n\np\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(y\u00b2 * 24) = 1.\n\nFactor out p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [1/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2)] = 1.\n\nLet me compute the term in brackets:\n\n1/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2).\n\nBut from equation 1, we know x\u00b2/20 = 1 + y\u00b2/24. So, x\u00b2 = 20(1 + y\u00b2/24) = 20 + (20 y\u00b2)/24 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSubstitute this into the term in brackets:\n\n1/20 - [ (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / (24 y\u00b2) ) ].\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 = (120 + 5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, denominator is 24 y\u00b2.\n\nSo, the term becomes:\n\n1/20 - [ (120 + 5 y\u00b2) / (6 * 24 y\u00b2) ) ] = 1/20 - [ (120 + 5 y\u00b2) / (144 y\u00b2) ) ].\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\n(120 + 5 y\u00b2) / (144 y\u00b2) = (120)/(144 y\u00b2) + (5 y\u00b2)/(144 y\u00b2) = (5/6 y\u00b2) + (5/144).\n\nWait, let me compute 120 / 144 = 5/6, and 5 y\u00b2 / 144 y\u00b2 = 5/144.\n\nSo, the term is 1/20 - (5/(6 y\u00b2) + 5/144).\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, no, let's re-express:\n\nWait, 120 + 5 y\u00b2 over 144 y\u00b2 is equal to (120)/(144 y\u00b2) + (5 y\u00b2)/(144 y\u00b2) = (5/6 y\u00b2) + (5/144). Hmm, actually, 120/144 is 5/6, but it's 120/(144 y\u00b2) which is (5)/(6 y\u00b2). Similarly, 5 y\u00b2 / 144 y\u00b2 is 5/144. So, the term is (5)/(6 y\u00b2) + 5/144.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the term in brackets is:\n\n1/20 - [ (5)/(6 y\u00b2) + 5/144 ].\n\nSo, let's write this as:\n\n1/20 - 5/(6 y\u00b2) - 5/144.\n\nNow, let's combine the constants:\n\n1/20 - 5/144 = (144 - 100)/(20*144) )? Wait, 1/20 is 7.2/144, 5/144 is 5/144. So, 7.2/144 - 5/144 = 2.2/144 = 11/720. Hmm, perhaps better to compute exact fractions.\n\nCompute 1/20 - 5/144:\n\nFind a common denominator, which is 360.\n\n1/20 = 18/360, 5/144 = 12.5/360. Wait, but 5/144 = (5 * 2.5)/360? Wait, maybe another approach.\n\nWait, 1/20 = 9/180, 5/144 = 25/720. So, convert to 720 denominator:\n\n1/20 = 36/720, 5/144 = 25/720.\n\nSo, 36/720 - 25/720 = 11/720.\n\nSo, 1/20 -5/144=11/720.\n\nSo, the term in brackets becomes:\n\n11/720 - 5/(6 y\u00b2).\n\nSo, going back to equation 2:\n\np\u00b2 [ 11/720 - 5/(6 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 1 / [11/720 - 5/(6 y\u00b2)].\n\nLet me write that as:\n\np\u00b2 = 1 / [ (11 - 60/(y\u00b2)) / 720 ] = 720 / (11 - 60/(y\u00b2)).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 720 / (11 - 60/(y\u00b2)).\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe we can express this differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express BD\u00b2 in terms of y\u00b2.\n\nRecall that BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nFrom equation 3: q = (-x p)/y.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/y\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/y\u00b2) = 4 p\u00b2 (1 + x\u00b2 / y\u00b2).\n\nFrom equation 1: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 => x\u00b2 = 20(1 + y\u00b2/24) = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 / y\u00b2 = 20 / y\u00b2 + 5/6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 p\u00b2 [1 + 20 / y\u00b2 + 5/6 ] = 4 p\u00b2 [ (6 + 20/y\u00b2 + 5)/6 ].\n\nWait, that might not be the most straightforward way. Let me compute 1 + x\u00b2/y\u00b2:\n\n1 + x\u00b2/y\u00b2 = 1 + (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / y\u00b2 = 1 + 20 / y\u00b2 + (5 y\u00b2)/(6 y\u00b2) = 1 + 20 / y\u00b2 + 5/6.\n\nSo, 1 + 20 / y\u00b2 + 5/6 = (6 + 5)/6 + 20 / y\u00b2 = 11/6 + 20 / y\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 p\u00b2 (11/6 + 20 / y\u00b2 ).\n\nBut from earlier, we have p\u00b2 = 720 / (11 - 60 / y\u00b2 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 * [720 / (11 - 60 / y\u00b2 ) ] * (11/6 + 20 / y\u00b2 ).\n\nLet me compute this expression:\n\nFirst, compute 4 * 720 = 2880.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 2880 * [ (11/6 + 20 / y\u00b2 ) / (11 - 60 / y\u00b2 ) ].\n\nLet me let t = 1/y\u00b2. Then, since y\u00b2 is positive (as it's on the hyperbola), t is positive.\n\nSo, substitute t:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 2880 * [ (11/6 + 20 t ) / (11 - 60 t ) ].\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 2880 * [ (11/6 + 20 t ) / (11 - 60 t ) ].\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 2880 * ( (11/6 + 20 t) / (11 - 60 t) ).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 11/6 + 20 t = (11 + 120 t)/6.\n\nDenominator: 11 - 60 t.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 2880 * [ (11 + 120 t)/6 ] / (11 - 60 t ) = 2880 * (11 + 120 t) / [6(11 - 60 t)].\n\nSimplify 2880 / 6 = 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480 * (11 + 120 t) / (11 - 60 t).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480 * [ (11 + 120 t) / (11 - 60 t) ].\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480 * [ (11 + 120 t) / (11 - 60 t) ].\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 11 + 120 t = 11 + 120 t.\n\nDenominator: 11 - 60 t.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor out 11 in numerator and denominator? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, write it as:\n\n(11 + 120 t) / (11 - 60 t) = [ 11(1) + 120 t ] / [ 11(1) - 60 t ].\n\nLet me think of this as a function f(t) = (11 + 120 t)/(11 - 60 t), and I need to find the minimum of BD\u00b2 = 480 f(t).\n\nBut wait, actually, since BD\u00b2 is proportional to f(t), and we have constraints on t.\n\nBut what is the domain of t?\n\nt = 1/y\u00b2, and since point A is on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, so y\u00b2 must be positive, so t is positive.\n\nMoreover, from equation 3: yq = -xp.\n\nWe can have both positive and negative coordinates, but since we're dealing with squares, perhaps the sign isn't important.\n\nBut for the denominator 11 - 60 t in f(t), we must have 11 - 60 t > 0, because p\u00b2 must be positive, as it's a square.\n\nSo, 11 - 60 t > 0 => t < 11/60 \u2248 0.1833.\n\nAlso, t must be positive, so t \u2208 (0, 11/60).\n\nSo, t is between 0 and 11/60.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimum of BD\u00b2 = 480*(11 + 120 t)/(11 - 60 t) over t \u2208 (0, 11/60).\n\nTo find the minimum, let's analyze the function f(t) = (11 + 120 t)/(11 - 60 t).\n\nCompute derivative of f(t) with respect to t:\n\nf(t) = (11 + 120 t)/(11 - 60 t).\n\nf'(t) = [ (120)(11 - 60 t) - (11 + 120 t)(-60) ] / (11 - 60 t)^2.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n120*(11 - 60t) + 60*(11 + 120t) =\n\n120*11 - 120*60 t + 60*11 + 60*120 t.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n120*11 = 1320.\n\n-120*60 t = -7200 t.\n\n60*11 = 660.\n\n60*120 t = 7200 t.\n\nSo, adding together:\n\n1320 + 660 + (-7200 t + 7200 t) = 1980 + 0 = 1980.\n\nSo, f'(t) = 1980 / (11 - 60 t)^2.\n\nSince the denominator is always positive for t < 11/60, and numerator is positive, f'(t) is always positive. So, f(t) is increasing on t \u2208 (0, 11/60).\n\nTherefore, the minimum of f(t) occurs at t approaching 0, and the maximum as t approaches 11/60.\n\nBut wait, BD\u00b2 is 480*f(t), so BD\u00b2 is also increasing with t.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs at t approaching 0.\n\nBut wait, t approaches 0 from the positive side. So, as t approaches 0, f(t) approaches (11 + 0)/(11 - 0) = 1.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480*1 = 480.\n\nBut wait, t=0 is not allowed because then y would be infinite, which isn't possible. So, BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480 but can't actually reach it.\n\nWait, but let me check: when t approaches 0, what happens to points A and B?\n\nIf t =1/y\u00b2 approaches 0, then y\u00b2 approaches infinity. So, point A is (x, y) where y is very large. From hyperbola equation, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6. So, x\u00b2 approaches (5/6)y\u00b2 as y\u00b2 becomes large. So, x is approximately \u00b1sqrt(5/6) y.\n\nSimilarly, point B is (p, q) where p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nFrom equation 3: q = (-x p)/y.\n\nAs y approaches infinity, q approaches 0 (since x ~ sqrt(5/6) y, so x p / y ~ sqrt(5/6) p). So, q ~ -sqrt(5/6) p.\n\nBut from hyperbola equation for point B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSubstitute q ~ -sqrt(5/6) p:\n\np\u00b2/20 - (5/6 p\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nCompute:\n\np\u00b2/20 - (5 p\u00b2)/(6*24) = p\u00b2/20 - (5 p\u00b2)/144.\n\nConvert to common denominator:\n\n(7.2 p\u00b2 - 5 p\u00b2)/144 = (2.2 p\u00b2)/144 = (11 p\u00b2)/720.\n\nSo, (11 p\u00b2)/720 =1 => p\u00b2 = 720/11 => p = \u00b1sqrt(720/11).\n\nSo, as t approaches 0, p approaches sqrt(720/11). So, p\u00b2 approaches 720/11 \u224865.4545.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2 =4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) =4( p\u00b2 + (5/6 p\u00b2) ) =4( (11/6)p\u00b2 )= (44/6) p\u00b2= (22/3)p\u00b2.\n\nWait, but p\u00b2 =720/11, so BD\u00b2= (22/3)*(720/11)= (22*720)/(3*11)= (22/11)*(720/3)=2*(240)=480.\n\nSo, as t approaches 0, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut wait, when t approaches 0, the rhombus becomes very \"stretched\" along the y-axis, with points A and C approaching (\u00b1sqrt(5/6) y, \u00b1y) as y approaches infinity. Points B and D approach fixed points (\u00b1sqrt(720/11), 0), since q approaches zero. So, the rhombus becomes almost like a very tall and thin diamond with two points at infinity and two points fixed on the x-axis.\n\nBut BD is the distance between B and D, which in the limit is 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), but as q approaches zero, BD approaches 2p, so BD\u00b2 approaches 4p\u00b2=4*(720/11)= 2880/11\u2248261.818, which contradicts our earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, that's a problem. There must be a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, let's double-check.\n\nEarlier, I thought that as t approaches 0, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, but when I considered the limit with points approaching infinity, it suggests BD\u00b2 approaches 2880/11\u2248261.818.\n\nWait, that's a discrepancy. So, which one is correct?\n\nLet me go back.\n\nWait, I think I messed up when I substituted q ~ -sqrt(5/6) p into the hyperbola equation for point B.\n\nWait, q = (-x p)/y.\n\nBut as y approaches infinity, x ~ sqrt(5/6) y, so q ~ (-sqrt(5/6) y p)/y = -sqrt(5/6) p.\n\nSo, q ~ -sqrt(5/6) p.\n\nSo, plugging into the hyperbola equation:\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2/20 - ( (5/6 p\u00b2 ) ) /24 =1.\n\nWhich is p\u00b2/20 - (5 p\u00b2)/(6*24)= p\u00b2/20 -5 p\u00b2/144.\n\nWhich is equal to (7.2 p\u00b2 -5 p\u00b2)/144 = 2.2 p\u00b2 /144 = (11 p\u00b2)/720=1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2=720/11.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 is fixed as 720/11, so p is \u00b1sqrt(720/11).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)=4(p\u00b2 + (5/6 p\u00b2))=4*(11/6 p\u00b2)= (44/6)p\u00b2= (22/3)p\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=(22/3)*(720/11)= (22*720)/(3*11)= (22/11)*(720/3)=2*240=480.\n\nSo, that's consistent with the earlier conclusion.\n\nBut earlier, I thought BD approaches 2p, but that was incorrect because q doesn't approach zero; rather, q approaches -sqrt(5/6) p, which is a constant multiple of p. So, q\u00b2 is (5/6)p\u00b2, so BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)=4(p\u00b2 +5/6 p\u00b2)=4*(11/6 p\u00b2)= (44/6)p\u00b2= (22/3)p\u00b2, which is 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as t approaches 0.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I thought BD approaches 2p, that was wrong because q isn't approaching zero; it's approaching a fixed multiple of p. So, BD\u00b2 is indeed approaching 480.\n\nBut then, is 480 the minimal value of BD\u00b2? Because BD\u00b2 is increasing as t increases, approaching t=11/60, which would make denominator zero, but t can't reach 11/60 because p\u00b2 would blow up.\n\nWait, but in reality, as t approaches 11/60 from below, the denominator 11 -60 t approaches zero, so p\u00b2 approaches infinity, so BD\u00b2 would also approach infinity.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be as large as we want, but it approaches 480 from above as t approaches 0. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, approached as the rhombus becomes very \"stretched\" along the y-axis.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480, but never less than 480, then 480 is the infimum. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, but since BD\u00b2 can't be less than 480, the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480 in the limit, but can it actually attain 480? No, because t=0 is not allowed (as y would be infinite). So, BD\u00b2 can approach 480 but never actually reaches it. Therefore, the infimum is 480, but it's not attained. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, then 480 is the infimum, but the question is asking for the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Hmm, but if BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as desired, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480 itself, because for any number greater than 480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 less than that number. Wait, no, that's the opposite.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nIf the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, then BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480. So, for any L < 480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < L? No, that's not correct. Wait, no, the infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, BD\u00b2 is always \u2265 480, so 480 is the minimal value of BD\u00b2, approached as t approaches 0.\n\nTherefore, for any L < 480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < L? No, that can't be, because BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480.\n\nWait, actually, if the infimum is 480, that means BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as we like, but never goes below 480. So, 480 is the greatest lower bound. So, the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480, so 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But the question says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, 480 is the infimum, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480. Because any number greater than 480 would not be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, since BD\u00b2 can be as close to 480 as we want.\n\nWait, but 480 is the infimum, so BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 from above. So, for any \u03b5 >0, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < 480 + \u03b5. But for any number L <480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < L? No, because BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480, so for L <480, there are no rhombi with BD\u00b2 < L. So, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because 480 \u2264 BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, so 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2, but for any number greater than 480, say 480 + \u03b5, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < 480 + \u03b5. But the problem is asking for the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, that would be 480, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480. So, 480 is the greatest lower bound, so the answer is 480.\n\nBut let me think again: if BD\u00b2 can approach 480, but never be less than 480, then 480 is the infimum, and any number less than 480 is also less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But the question is asking for the greatest such number. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because it's the infimum.\n\nWait, but 480 is not less than BD\u00b2; it's equal to the infimum. Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me read the question again: \"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the number must be less than BD\u00b2 for every rhombus. So, the number must be a lower bound for BD\u00b2. The greatest such lower bound is the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 480.\n\nBut if BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480, then 480 is the greatest lower bound. So, any number greater than 480 is not a lower bound because there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 =480 + \u03b5. But 480 is the greatest number that is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nWait, but the question says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's looking for a number L such that L < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. The greatest such L is the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because for any L less than the infimum, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 less than L. So, the greatest L such that L < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the infimum.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. If the infimum is 480, then for any L <480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < L. So, L cannot be greater than 480 because then there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 between 480 and L, which would violate L < BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, but can be larger. So, the set of possible BD\u00b2 is [480, \u221e). So, the question is asking for the greatest number L such that L < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. That would be L=480, because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, so L=480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But the question says \"less than BD\u00b2.\" So, if L=480, is 480 < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi? No, because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480 in the limit, but never actually less than 480. So, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480.\n\nWait, but in reality, BD\u00b2 can't actually be 480 because that would require t=0, which isn't allowed as it would make y infinite. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480. So, 480 is the infimum, and BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480 from above. So, for any \u03b5>0, there's a rhombus with BD\u00b2 <480 + \u03b5. But for any L <480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < L? No, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480.\n\nWait, no. If BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, then for any L <480, there's no rhombus with BD\u00b2 < L. So, the set of lower bounds for BD\u00b2 is (-\u221e,480]. But the question is asking for the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, that number must be less than BD\u00b2 for every rhombus. Since BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, any number less than 480 would not satisfy the condition because you can have BD\u00b2 as close to 480 as you want. So, the only number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480 itself, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480.\n\nWait, but 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480. So, perhaps the answer is 480, but phrased as the infimum.\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled here. Let me try to think differently.\n\nIf the infimum is 480, then for any \u03b5>0, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 <480 + \u03b5. So, the greatest number L such that L < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi must be L=480, because if you take L=480 + \u03b5 for any \u03b5>0, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < L. But if you take L=480, then for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 >480, so 480 < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But wait, no, in reality, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, so there are rhombi with BD\u00b2 as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480.\n\nWait, no, if BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above, then BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480. So, 480 is the infimum, and BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480. Therefore, 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because for any number greater than 480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 between 480 and that number. But for 480 itself, BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480, so 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, then 480 is not less than BD\u00b2, it's equal. So, perhaps the answer is 480, but phrased as the infimum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal BD\u00b2 is 2880/11, which is approximately 261.818. Wait, where did I get that number earlier?\n\nWait, when I thought about BD approaching 2p, but that was a mistake because q doesn't approach zero but a fixed multiple of p.\n\nWait, let me compute BD\u00b2 when t approaches 11/60. Wait, t=1/y\u00b2 approaches 11/60, so y\u00b2 approaches 60/11.\n\nThen, from equation 1: x\u00b2 =20 +5 y\u00b2 /6=20 +5*(60/11)/6=20 +5*(10/11)=20 +50/11= (220 +50)/11=270/11.\n\nSo, x\u00b2=270/11, y\u00b2=60/11.\n\nFrom equation 3: q= -x p / y.\n\nSo, q= - (sqrt(270/11) p)/sqrt(60/11)= - sqrt(270/11 /60/11) p= -sqrt(270/60) p= -sqrt(4.5) p= - (3 sqrt(0.5)) p= - (3/\u221a2) p.\n\nSo, q= -3/\u221a2 p.\n\nThen, from equation 2: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSubstitute q:\n\np\u00b2/20 - ( (9/2)p\u00b2 ) /24=1.\n\nSimplify:\n\np\u00b2/20 - (9 p\u00b2)/(48)=1.\n\nConvert to common denominator:\n\n(12 p\u00b2 - 15 p\u00b2)/120= (-3 p\u00b2)/120= -p\u00b2/40=1.\n\nWhich implies p\u00b2= -40, which is impossible. So, that can't be.\n\nWait, that suggests that when t approaches 11/60, p\u00b2 becomes negative, which is impossible. So, that's a contradiction. Therefore, t cannot approach 11/60 from below because it would require p\u00b2 to be negative, which is impossible. So, perhaps my earlier assumption that BD\u00b2 can approach 480 is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the derivative earlier. Let me re-examine.\n\nWe had BD\u00b2=480*(11 + 120 t)/(11 -60 t).\n\nWe found that f(t)=(11 +120 t)/(11 -60 t) is increasing on t \u2208 (0,11/60).\n\nBut when t approaches 11/60, denominator approaches zero, so f(t) approaches infinity. So, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut when t approaches 0, f(t) approaches 11/11=1, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480*1=480.\n\nBut when t approaches some other value?\n\nWait, but when t approaches 11/60, p\u00b2 approaches infinity, which is not possible because p\u00b2 must satisfy p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24=1, and q is related to p via q= -x p / y.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a maximum value of t beyond which p\u00b2 becomes negative, which is impossible. So, the domain of t is such that 11 -60 t>0, so t<11/60, but also, from equation 3 and the hyperbola equation for point B, p\u00b2 must be positive.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the substitution.\n\nWe had p\u00b2=720/(11 -60 t).\n\nSo, for p\u00b2 to be positive, denominator must be positive, so 11 -60 t>0 => t<11/60.\n\nSo, t can go up to, but not including, 11/60.\n\nBut when t approaches 11/60, p\u00b2 approaches infinity, which would require q to approach -sqrt(5/6) p, which is also approaching infinity.\n\nSo, as t approaches 11/60, points B and D go to infinity along the line q= -sqrt(5/6)p.\n\nBut that's acceptable because points can be anywhere on the hyperbola.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried substituting t=11/60, I got p\u00b2= -40, which is impossible, but that's because at t=11/60, the denominator becomes zero, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, t can approach 11/60, making p\u00b2 approach infinity, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(11 +120 t)/(11 -60 t).\n\nSince f(t) is increasing, BD\u00b2 increases from 480 to infinity as t increases from 0 to 11/60.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 has a minimum value of 480, approached as t approaches 0, and can be made arbitrarily large as t approaches 11/60.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, which is the infimum. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nBut wait, BD\u00b2 cannot be less than 480 because as t approaches 0, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, so 480 is the infimum.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all rhombi \\( ABCD \\) inscribed in the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\), where the diagonals intersect at the origin. \n\nTo solve this, we consider the properties of a rhombus and the given hyperbola. The diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular, and their intersection at the origin implies symmetry. Points \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) are symmetric with respect to the origin, as are points \\( B \\) and \\( D \\). \n\nUsing the hyperbola equation and the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular, we derive expressions for the coordinates of the points and the length of diagonal \\( BD \\). After analyzing the function \\( BD^2 \\) in terms of a parameter \\( t \\), we find that \\( BD^2 \\) approaches 480 as \\( t \\) approaches 0. Since \\( BD^2 \\) is always greater than or equal to 480, the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{480}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. There are four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, so I'm looking for the infimum of BD\u00b2, right? Or maybe the minimum value BD\u00b2 can take? Wait, the question says the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So it's like the supremum of lower bounds, which would be the infimum. So, the smallest possible BD\u00b2 is the infimum, and the answer is the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2, which would approach the infimum. So, I think I need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2.\n\nFirst, let's recall some properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, hold on. I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, that's a square. Wait, no, let me correct that. In a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal, but they do bisect each other at right angles. So, yes, they are perpendicular. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, then points A and C are opposite each other through the origin, same with B and D.\n\nSo, if A is (x, y), then C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D would be (-p, -q). So, the four points are (x,y), (p,q), (-x,-y), (-p,-q). \n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, and so on. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors, perhaps I can use vectors or coordinate geometry to model this.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the properties of the rhombus. Since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, the sides can be found using the lengths of the diagonals. If the lengths of the diagonals are d1 and d2, then each side of the rhombus is sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 ). So, the side length is (1/2) * sqrt(d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2).\n\nBut in this case, the hyperbola is given, so points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola. So, maybe I can parametrize points on the hyperbola and use the rhombus condition.\n\nLet me think about parametrizing the hyperbola. The standard parametrization for a hyperbola is using hyperbolic functions. For x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a parametrization is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). Alternatively, sometimes people use (a cosh t, b sinh t), but that's for the right hyperbola. Let me check.\n\nYes, for hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, a parametrization can be (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), where \u03b8 is a parameter. Alternatively, using hyperbola functions: (a cosh t, b sinh t). Both are valid, but which one is more convenient here?\n\nSince we have points in pairs symmetric about the origin, maybe it's better to use the parametrization with \u03b8, because then each point can be represented as (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), and the opposite point would be (-a sec\u03b8, -b tan\u03b8). Similarly, another point can be (a sec\u03c6, b tan\u03c6), with the opposite point (-a sec\u03c6, -b tan\u03c6).\n\nSo, let's let point A be (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), point C would then be (-a sec\u03b8, -b tan\u03b8). Similarly, point B is (a sec\u03c6, b tan\u03c6), and point D is (-a sec\u03c6, -b tan\u03c6). \n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance AB should be equal to BC, which should be equal to CD, which should be equal to DA. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to use vectors to represent the sides.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are AC and BD, and they intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint. So, the diagonals are AC and BD. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.\n\nWait, yes, because in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular. Let me write that down.\n\nVector AC is from A to C: C - A = (-a sec\u03b8 - a sec\u03b8, -b tan\u03b8 - b tan\u03b8) = (-2a sec\u03b8, -2b tan\u03b8). Similarly, vector BD is D - B = (-a sec\u03c6 - a sec\u03c6, -b tan\u03c6 - b tan\u03c6) = (-2a sec\u03c6, -2b tan\u03c6).\n\nWait, but actually, the vectors AC and BD are just the diagonals, so they are the vectors from the origin to C and D, but since they are diagonals, their direction is from A to C and from B to D, but since the origin is the midpoint, the vectors AC and BD can be represented as (2a sec\u03b8, 2b tan\u03b8) and (2a sec\u03c6, 2b tan\u03c6), but actually, wait, if A is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), then C is (-a sec\u03b8, -b tan\u03b8), so the vector AC would be (-a sec\u03b8 - a sec\u03b8, -b tan\u03b8 - b tan\u03b8) = (-2a sec\u03b8, -2b tan\u03b8). Similarly, BD is from B to D: D is (-a sec\u03c6, -b tan\u03c6), so vector BD is (-a sec\u03c6 - a sec\u03c6, -b tan\u03c6 - b tan\u03c6) = (-2a sec\u03c6, -2b tan\u03c6).\n\nBut wait, actually, the vectors AC and BD are from the origin to the points, but since the origin is the midpoint, the vectors are just the position vectors of A and B, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the diagonals are AC and BD. The diagonal AC connects points A and C, which are (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8) and (-a sec\u03b8, -b tan\u03b8). So, the vector AC is C - A, which is (-2a sec\u03b8, -2b tan\u03b8). Similarly, the vector BD is D - B, which is (-2a sec\u03c6, -2b tan\u03c6). \n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product must be zero. So,\n\nAC \u2022 BD = 0\n\nSo, (-2a sec\u03b8)(-2a sec\u03c6) + (-2b tan\u03b8)(-2b tan\u03c6) = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(4a\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6) + (4b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\na\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0\n\nSo, that's our first equation.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. Let's compute the length of AB and set it equal to the length of BC.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to consider the condition for sides AB and AD to be equal. Alternatively, maybe using vectors is better.\n\nWait, let's compute vectors AB and AD.\n\nPoint A is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), point B is (a sec\u03c6, b tan\u03c6), so vector AB is (a sec\u03c6 - a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03c6 - b tan\u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, point D is (-a sec\u03c6, -b tan\u03c6), so vector AD is (-a sec\u03c6 - a sec\u03b8, -b tan\u03c6 - b tan\u03b8).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, the lengths of AB and AD must be equal.\n\nSo, |AB|\u00b2 = |AD|\u00b2.\n\nCompute |AB|\u00b2:\n\n= (a sec\u03c6 - a sec\u03b8)^2 + (b tan\u03c6 - b tan\u03b8)^2\n\n= a\u00b2 (sec\u03c6 - sec\u03b8)^2 + b\u00b2 (tan\u03c6 - tan\u03b8)^2\n\nSimilarly, |AD|\u00b2:\n\n= (-a sec\u03c6 - a sec\u03b8)^2 + (-b tan\u03c6 - b tan\u03b8)^2\n\n= a\u00b2 (sec\u03c6 + sec\u03b8)^2 + b\u00b2 (tan\u03c6 + tan\u03b8)^2\n\nSet them equal:\n\na\u00b2 (sec\u03c6 - sec\u03b8)^2 + b\u00b2 (tan\u03c6 - tan\u03b8)^2 = a\u00b2 (sec\u03c6 + sec\u03b8)^2 + b\u00b2 (tan\u03c6 + tan\u03b8)^2\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side:\n\n= a\u00b2 [sec\u00b2\u03c6 - 2 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 + sec\u00b2\u03b8] + b\u00b2 [tan\u00b2\u03c6 - 2 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 + tan\u00b2\u03b8]\n\nRight side:\n\n= a\u00b2 [sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 2 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 + sec\u00b2\u03b8] + b\u00b2 [tan\u00b2\u03c6 + 2 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 + tan\u00b2\u03b8]\n\nSubtract left side from right side:\n\n0 = a\u00b2 [ (sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 2 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 + sec\u00b2\u03b8) - (sec\u00b2\u03c6 - 2 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 + sec\u00b2\u03b8) ] + b\u00b2 [ (tan\u00b2\u03c6 + 2 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 + tan\u00b2\u03b8) - (tan\u00b2\u03c6 - 2 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 + tan\u00b2\u03b8) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= a\u00b2 [4 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8] + b\u00b2 [4 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8] = 0\n\nSo,\n\n4a\u00b2 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 + 4b\u00b2 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\na\u00b2 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 + b\u00b2 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 = 0\n\nWait, that's the same equation as the one we got from the diagonals being perpendicular. So, both conditions lead to the same equation: a\u00b2 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 + b\u00b2 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 = 0.\n\nSo, that's a single equation connecting \u03b8 and \u03c6. Let me write that down:\n\na\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nGiven that a\u00b2 = 20 and b\u00b2 = 24, so substituting:\n\n20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's equation (1). So, that's the condition that must be satisfied.\n\nNow, our goal is to find BD\u00b2. BD is the length of the diagonal from B to D. Wait, but since BD is a diagonal of the rhombus, its length can be found from points B and D.\n\nPoint B is (a sec\u03c6, b tan\u03c6), point D is (-a sec\u03c6, -b tan\u03c6). So, the distance BD is the distance between these two points.\n\nCompute BD\u00b2:\n\n= [(-a sec\u03c6 - a sec\u03c6)]\u00b2 + [(-b tan\u03c6 - b tan\u03c6)]\u00b2\n\n= [(-2a sec\u03c6)]\u00b2 + [(-2b tan\u03c6)]\u00b2\n\n= 4a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 4b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 4b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nOur goal is to find the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi, which depends on \u03c6 and \u03b8, but with the constraint given by equation (1).\n\nSo, we have BD\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6), and the constraint 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nI need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2 given this constraint. Let me think about how to relate \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nFrom equation (1): 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nLet me rewrite this equation.\n\n20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 = -24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 = -6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6\n\nExpress sec\u03b8 and tan\u03b8 in terms of sine and cosine.\n\nsec\u03b8 = 1/cos\u03b8, tan\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 / cos\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n5 * (1/cos\u03b8) * (1/cos\u03c6) = -6 * (sin\u03b8 / cos\u03b8) * (sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6)\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6:\n\n5 = -6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\nSo,\n\n5 = -6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\nWhich implies:\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, the product of sines of \u03b8 and \u03c6 is -5/6.\n\nNow, let's see if we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8 and \u03c6, and then use this constraint to find the minimum.\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6) = 4(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6) = 4(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4[20 (1/cos\u00b2\u03c6) + 24 (sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6)] = 4[ (20 + 24 sin\u00b2\u03c6) / cos\u00b2\u03c6 ]\n\n= 4(20 + 24 sin\u00b2\u03c6) / cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut 1/cos\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6, so maybe that's helpful. Alternatively, let's express everything in terms of sin\u03c6.\n\nWe know that cos\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6, so 1/cos\u00b2\u03c6 = 1/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4(20 + 24 sin\u00b2\u03c6) / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6)\n\nLet me let t = sin\u03c6. Then, sin\u03c6 = t, so t \u2208 [-1, 1], but given that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, and since the product is negative, sin\u03b8 and sin\u03c6 have opposite signs. So, either sin\u03b8 positive and sin\u03c6 negative, or vice versa.\n\nBut let's just proceed with t.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(20 + 24 t\u00b2) / (1 - t\u00b2).\n\nWe need to minimize BD\u00b2 in terms of t, given that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut sin\u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03c6) from equation sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWait, sin\u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03c6).\n\nBut sin\u03b8 must be between -1 and 1, so | (-5)/(6 sin\u03c6) | \u2264 1.\n\nWhich implies |5/(6 sin\u03c6)| \u2264 1 \u2192 |sin\u03c6| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, |sin\u03c6| \u2265 5/6.\n\nTherefore, t = sin\u03c6 must satisfy |t| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, t \u2208 [-1, -5/6] \u222a [5/6, 1].\n\nSo, in our expression for BD\u00b2, t is restricted to |t| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 as a function of t is:\n\nBD\u00b2(t) = 4*(20 + 24 t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2)\n\nWe need to find the minimum of BD\u00b2(t) for t \u2208 [-1, -5/6] \u222a [5/6, 1].\n\nSince the function is even in t, i.e., BD\u00b2(t) = BD\u00b2(-t), we can consider t \u2265 5/6 and find the minimum there.\n\nSo, let's let t \u2265 5/6, and find the minimum of f(t) = (20 + 24 t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nWait, but t\u00b2 is in [25/36, 1], but when t approaches 1, the denominator approaches 0, making f(t) approach infinity. So, the function has a minimum somewhere in [5/6, 1).\n\nTo find the minimum, take the derivative of f(t) with respect to t and set it to zero.\n\nLet me compute f(t):\n\nf(t) = (20 + 24 t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2)\n\nCompute derivative f\u2019(t):\n\nUsing quotient rule:\n\nf\u2019(t) = [ (48t)(1 - t\u00b2) - (20 + 24t\u00b2)(-2t) ] / (1 - t\u00b2)^2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n48t(1 - t\u00b2) + 2t(20 + 24t\u00b2)\n\n= 48t - 48t\u00b3 + 40t + 48t\u00b3\n\n= (48t + 40t) + (-48t\u00b3 + 48t\u00b3)\n\n= 88t\n\nSo, numerator is 88t, denominator is (1 - t\u00b2)^2.\n\nSet f\u2019(t) = 0:\n\n88t / (1 - t\u00b2)^2 = 0\n\nWhich implies 88t = 0 \u2192 t = 0.\n\nBut t = 0 is not in our domain of t \u2265 5/6. So, the function f(t) is increasing for t > 0 because f\u2019(t) is positive when t > 0 (since 88t is positive). So, on the interval [5/6, 1), f(t) is increasing. Therefore, the minimum occurs at t = 5/6.\n\nSo, the minimum BD\u00b2 occurs at t = 5/6.\n\nCompute BD\u00b2 at t = 5/6:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4*(20 + 24*(25/36)) / (1 - (25/36))\n\nFirst compute numerator:\n\n20 + 24*(25/36) = 20 + (24*25)/36\n\n24 and 36 have a common factor of 12: 24/36 = 2/3.\n\nSo, 24*(25)/36 = (2/3)*25 = 50/3 \u2248 16.6667.\n\nSo, numerator: 20 + 50/3 = (60/3 + 50/3) = 110/3.\n\nDenominator: 1 - 25/36 = (36 -25)/36 = 11/36.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(110/3) / (11/36) = 4*(110/3)*(36/11)\n\nSimplify:\n\n4 * (110/3) * (36/11) = 4 * (110 * 36) / (3 * 11)\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n36/3 = 12, 110/11 = 10.\n\nSo, 4 * 10 * 12 = 4 * 120 = 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480.\n\nWait, so BD\u00b2 is 480 when t = 5/6.\n\nBut wait, is this the minimal value?\n\nWait, since f(t) is increasing on [5/6, 1), the minimal value is at t = 5/6, which is 480. So, BD\u00b2 is minimized at 480, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be approaching 480 from above? Wait, no. Wait, since BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because BD\u00b2 cannot be lower than 480. So, 480 is the minimum value.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nCompute f(t) at t = 5/6:\n\nNumerator: 20 + 24*(25/36) = 20 + (24*25)/36.\n\n24*25 = 600; 600/36 = 16.666... which is 50/3.\n\n20 is 60/3, so 60/3 + 50/3 = 110/3.\n\nDenominator: 1 - 25/36 = 11/36.\n\nSo, (110/3) / (11/36) = (110/3) * (36/11) = (110 * 36) / (3 * 11) = (10 * 36) / 3 = (360)/3 = 120.\n\nWait, wait, so f(t) is 120, then BD\u00b2 is 4*120=480. Correct.\n\nBut let me think again: is 480 the minimal BD\u00b2? Because if t increases beyond 5/6, BD\u00b2 increases, as f(t) is increasing. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 can be 480 and above. So, the infimum is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 is always at least 480.\n\nWait, but wait: the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's like the supremum of lower bounds, which is the infimum. So, the infimum is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 can't be lower than 480.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2. So, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is \u2265 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because for every rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480. So, 480 is the minimal value, so the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Let me make sure.\n\nSuppose I have a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is exactly 480. Then, 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 can be 480, so any number less than 480 would be less than some BD\u00b2. So, the question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that would be the infimum, which is 480.\n\nWait, but that can't be because 480 is attainable. So, the infimum is 480, and thus the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Because for any number less than 480, say 480 - \u03b5, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is 480, which is greater than 480 - \u03b5. But the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of all lower bounds. Since BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, any number less than 480 would be a lower bound, but the greatest such number is 480 itself, because it's the infimum.\n\nWait, but 480 is attainable, so the infimum is 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 is always \u2265 480, so 480 is the lower bound, and it's attainable, so it's the greatest lower bound.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, when t = 5/6, sin\u03c6 = 5/6. Then, from equation (1), sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6. So, sin\u03b8 = (-5/6)/ (5/6) )= -1. So, sin\u03b8 = -1, which is \u03b8 = -\u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2.\n\nSo, point A is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). When \u03b8 = -\u03c0/2, sec\u03b8 is undefined because cos(-\u03c0/2) = 0. So, that's a problem.\n\nWait, that suggests that when t = 5/6, sin\u03b8 = -1, which is \u03b8 = -\u03c0/2. But at \u03b8 = -\u03c0/2, cos\u03b8 is zero, so sec\u03b8 is undefined. So, that point isn't on the hyperbola. So, that suggests that t cannot be exactly 5/6 because that would require \u03b8 to be -\u03c0/2, which is not allowed on the hyperbola.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is greater than 480 because t cannot reach exactly 5/6.\n\nWait, that's an important point. Because if t approaches 5/6 from above, then sin\u03c6 approaches 5/6, and sin\u03b8 approaches (-5/6)/(5/6) = -1. But as sin\u03b8 approaches -1, \u03b8 approaches -\u03c0/2, where cos\u03b8 approaches 0, making sec\u03b8 approach infinity. So, point A would go to infinity, which is not possible on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, but in reality, t can approach 5/6 but cannot equal it because that would cause point A to be at infinity. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is actually greater than 480. Therefore, BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480 but cannot actually reach it. So, the infimum is 480, but it's not attainable. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but how can that be? If BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as t approaches 5/6, but never actually reaches it, then 480 is the infimum, but not the minimum. So, the answer is 480, as the infimum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming t can approach 5/6. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 is defined for all real x except where x\u00b2/20 is less than 1, but actually, for hyperbola, x can be any real number except between -a and a, but in this case, a\u00b2 is 20, so x can be any real number except between -sqrt(20) and sqrt(20). Wait, no, the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, so it's a hyperbola opening left and right. So, x can be any real number, but points are only where x\u00b2 \u226520.\n\nWait, so when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, cos\u03b8 approaches 0, so sec\u03b8 approaches infinity, so x approaches infinity. So, points A and C would be at infinity, which isn't allowed. So, \u03b8 cannot be exactly \u03c0/2 or -\u03c0/2, but can approach it. So, in that case, when t approaches 5/6, sin\u03c6 approaches 5/6, so \u03c6 approaches arcsin(5/6), which is a valid angle where cos\u03c6 is sqrt(1 - (25/36)) = sqrt(11/36) = sqrt(11)/6. So, cos\u03c6 is non-zero, so sec\u03c6 is defined.\n\nWait, but when t approaches 5/6, sin\u03b8 approaches -1, so \u03b8 approaches -\u03c0/2, making cos\u03b8 approach 0, so sec\u03b8 approaches infinity. So, point A would be at (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), which would go to (\u00b1infty, \u00b1infty). So, in reality, the point A cannot be at infinity, so the minimal BD\u00b2 cannot actually be 480, but can approach it as \u03b8 approaches -\u03c0/2 and \u03c6 approaches arcsin(5/6). So, the infimum is 480, but it's not attainable. So, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the infimum is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 can be as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480. Therefore, 480 is the answer.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let me consider if there's any other constraint that might make the minimal BD\u00b2 higher than 480.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when t approaches 5/6, point A approaches infinity, which might not be allowed, so perhaps BD\u00b2 cannot actually get as low as 480. But in reality, the hyperbola extends to infinity, so points can be taken as far out as needed, making BD\u00b2 approach 480. So, the infimum is 480, and thus the answer is 480.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. There are four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, so I'm looking for the infimum of BD\u00b2, right? Or maybe the minimum value BD\u00b2 can take? Wait, the question says the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So it's like the supremum of lower bounds, which would be the infimum. So, the smallest possible BD\u00b2 is the infimum, and the answer is the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2, which would approach the infimum. So, I think I need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2.\n\nFirst, let's recall some properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, hold on. I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, that's a square. Wait, no, let me correct that. In a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal, but they do bisect each other at right angles. So, yes, they are perpendicular. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, then points A and C are opposite each other through the origin, same with B and D.\n\nSo, if A is (x, y), then C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D would be (-p, -q). So, the four points are (x,y), (p,q), (-x,-y), (-p,-q). \n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, and so on. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors, perhaps I can use vectors or coordinate geometry to model this.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the properties of the rhombus. Since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, the sides can be found using the lengths of the diagonals. If the lengths of the diagonals are d1 and d2, then each side of the rhombus is sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 ). So, the side length is (1/2) * sqrt(d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2).\n\nBut in this case, the hyperbola is given, so points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola. So, maybe I can parametrize points on the hyperbola and use the rhombus condition.\n\nLet me think about parametrizing the hyperbola. The standard parametrization for a hyperbola is using hyperbolic functions. For x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a parametrization is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). Alternatively, sometimes people use (a cosh t, b sinh t), but that's for the right hyperbola. Let me check.\n\nYes, for hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, a parametrization can be (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), where \u03b8 is a parameter. Alternatively, using hyperbola functions: (a cosh t, b sinh t). Both are valid, but which one is more convenient here?\n\nSince we have points in pairs symmetric about the origin, maybe it's better to use the parametrization with \u03b8, because then each point can be represented as (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), and the opposite point would be (-a sec\u03b8, -b tan\u03b8). Similarly, another point can be (a sec\u03c6, b tan\u03c6), with the opposite point (-a sec\u03c6, -b tan\u03c6).\n\nSo, let's let point A be (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), point C would then be (-a sec\u03b8, -b tan\u03b8). Similarly, point B is (a sec\u03c6, b tan\u03c6), and point D is (-a sec\u03c6, -b tan\u03c6). \n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance AB should be equal to BC, which should be equal to CD, which should be equal to DA. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to use vectors to represent the sides.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are AC and BD, and they intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint. So, the diagonals are AC and BD. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.\n\nWait, yes, because in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular. Let me write that down.\n\nVector AC is from A to C: C - A = (-a sec\u03b8 - a sec\u03b8, -b tan\u03b8 - b tan\u03b8) = (-2a sec\u03b8, -2b tan\u03b8). Similarly, vector BD is D - B = (-a sec\u03c6 - a sec\u03c6, -b tan\u03c6 - b tan\u03c6) = (-2a sec\u03c6, -2b tan\u03c6).\n\nWait, but actually, the vectors AC and BD are just the diagonals, so they are the vectors from the origin to C and D, but since they are diagonals, their direction is from A to C and from B to D, but since the origin is the midpoint, the vectors AC and BD can be represented as (2a sec\u03b8, 2b tan\u03b8) and (2a sec\u03c6, 2b tan\u03c6), but actually, wait, if A is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), then C is (-a sec\u03b8, -b tan\u03b8), so the vector AC would be (-a sec\u03b8 - a sec\u03b8, -b tan\u03b8 - b tan\u03b8) = (-2a sec\u03b8, -2b tan\u03b8). Similarly, BD is from B to D: D is (-a sec\u03c6, -b tan\u03c6), so vector BD is (-a sec\u03c6 - a sec\u03c6, -b tan\u03c6 - b tan\u03c6) = (-2a sec\u03c6, -2b tan\u03c6).\n\nBut wait, actually, the vectors AC and BD are from the origin to the points, but since the origin is the midpoint, the vectors are just the position vectors of A and B, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the diagonals are AC and BD. The diagonal AC connects points A and C, which are (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8) and (-a sec\u03b8, -b tan\u03b8). So, the vector AC is C - A, which is (-2a sec\u03b8, -2b tan\u03b8). Similarly, the vector BD is D - B, which is (-2a sec\u03c6, -2b tan\u03c6). \n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product must be zero. So,\n\nAC \u2022 BD = 0\n\nSo, (-2a sec\u03b8)(-2a sec\u03c6) + (-2b tan\u03b8)(-2b tan\u03c6) = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(4a\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6) + (4b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\na\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0\n\nSo, that's our first equation.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. Let's compute the length of AB and set it equal to the length of BC.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to consider the condition for sides AB and AD to be equal. Alternatively, maybe using vectors is better.\n\nWait, let's compute vectors AB and AD.\n\nPoint A is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), point B is (a sec\u03c6, b tan\u03c6), so vector AB is (a sec\u03c6 - a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03c6 - b tan\u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, point D is (-a sec\u03c6, -b tan\u03c6), so vector AD is (-a sec\u03c6 - a sec\u03b8, -b tan\u03c6 - b tan\u03b8).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, the lengths of AB and AD must be equal.\n\nSo, |AB|\u00b2 = |AD|\u00b2.\n\nCompute |AB|\u00b2:\n\n= (a sec\u03c6 - a sec\u03b8)^2 + (b tan\u03c6 - b tan\u03b8)^2\n\n= a\u00b2 (sec\u03c6 - sec\u03b8)^2 + b\u00b2 (tan\u03c6 - tan\u03b8)^2\n\nSimilarly, |AD|\u00b2:\n\n= (-a sec\u03c6 - a sec\u03b8)^2 + (-b tan\u03c6 - b tan\u03b8)^2\n\n= a\u00b2 (sec\u03c6 + sec\u03b8)^2 + b\u00b2 (tan\u03c6 + tan\u03b8)^2\n\nSet them equal:\n\na\u00b2 (sec\u03c6 - sec\u03b8)^2 + b\u00b2 (tan\u03c6 - tan\u03b8)^2 = a\u00b2 (sec\u03c6 + sec\u03b8)^2 + b\u00b2 (tan\u03c6 + tan\u03b8)^2\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side:\n\n= a\u00b2 [sec\u00b2\u03c6 - 2 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 + sec\u00b2\u03b8] + b\u00b2 [tan\u00b2\u03c6 - 2 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 + tan\u00b2\u03b8]\n\nRight side:\n\n= a\u00b2 [sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 2 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 + sec\u00b2\u03b8] + b\u00b2 [tan\u00b2\u03c6 + 2 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 + tan\u00b2\u03b8]\n\nSubtract left side from right side:\n\n0 = a\u00b2 [ (sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 2 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 + sec\u00b2\u03b8) - (sec\u00b2\u03c6 - 2 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 + sec\u00b2\u03b8) ] + b\u00b2 [ (tan\u00b2\u03c6 + 2 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 + tan\u00b2\u03b8) - (tan\u00b2\u03c6 - 2 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 + tan\u00b2\u03b8) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= a\u00b2 [4 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8] + b\u00b2 [4 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8] = 0\n\nSo,\n\n4a\u00b2 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 + 4b\u00b2 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\na\u00b2 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 + b\u00b2 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 = 0\n\nWait, that's the same equation as the one we got from the diagonals being perpendicular. So, both conditions lead to the same equation: a\u00b2 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 + b\u00b2 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 = 0.\n\nSo, that's a single equation connecting \u03b8 and \u03c6. Let me write that down:\n\na\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nGiven that a\u00b2 = 20 and b\u00b2 = 24, so substituting:\n\n20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's equation (1). So, that's the condition that must be satisfied.\n\nNow, our goal is to find BD\u00b2. BD is the length of the diagonal from B to D. Wait, but since BD is a diagonal of the rhombus, its length can be found from points B and D.\n\nPoint B is (a sec\u03c6, b tan\u03c6), point D is (-a sec\u03c6, -b tan\u03c6). So, the distance BD is the distance between these two points.\n\nCompute BD\u00b2:\n\n= [(-a sec\u03c6 - a sec\u03c6)]\u00b2 + [(-b tan\u03c6 - b tan\u03c6)]\u00b2\n\n= [(-2a sec\u03c6)]\u00b2 + [(-2b tan\u03c6)]\u00b2\n\n= 4a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 4b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 4b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nOur goal is to find the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi, which depends on \u03c6 and \u03b8, but with the constraint given by equation (1).\n\nSo, we have BD\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6), and the constraint 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nI need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2 given this constraint. Let me think about how to relate \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nFrom equation (1): 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nLet me rewrite this equation.\n\n20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 = -24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 = -6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6\n\nExpress sec\u03b8 and tan\u03b8 in terms of sine and cosine.\n\nsec\u03b8 = 1/cos\u03b8, tan\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 / cos\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n5 * (1/cos\u03b8) * (1/cos\u03c6) = -6 * (sin\u03b8 / cos\u03b8) * (sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6)\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6:\n\n5 = -6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\nSo,\n\n5 = -6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\nWhich implies:\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, the product of sines of \u03b8 and \u03c6 is -5/6.\n\nNow, let's see if we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8 and \u03c6, and then use this constraint to find the minimum.\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6) = 4(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6) = 4(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4[20 (1/cos\u00b2\u03c6) + 24 (sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6)] = 4[ (20 + 24 sin\u00b2\u03c6) / cos\u00b2\u03c6 ]\n\n= 4(20 + 24 sin\u00b2\u03c6) / cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut 1/cos\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6, so maybe that's helpful. Alternatively, let's express everything in terms of sin\u03c6.\n\nWe know that cos\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6, so 1/cos\u00b2\u03c6 = 1/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4(20 + 24 sin\u00b2\u03c6) / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6)\n\nLet me let t = sin\u03c6. Then, sin\u03c6 = t, so t \u2208 [-1, 1], but given that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, and since the product is negative, sin\u03b8 and sin\u03c6 have opposite signs. So, either sin\u03b8 positive and sin\u03c6 negative, or vice versa.\n\nBut let's just proceed with t.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(20 + 24 t\u00b2) / (1 - t\u00b2).\n\nWe need to minimize BD\u00b2 in terms of t, given that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut sin\u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03c6) from equation sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWait, sin\u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03c6).\n\nBut sin\u03b8 must be between -1 and 1, so | (-5)/(6 sin\u03c6) | \u2264 1.\n\nWhich implies |5/(6 sin\u03c6)| \u2264 1 \u2192 |sin\u03c6| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, |sin\u03c6| \u2265 5/6.\n\nTherefore, t = sin\u03c6 must satisfy |t| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, t \u2208 [-1, -5/6] \u222a [5/6, 1].\n\nSo, in our expression for BD\u00b2, t is restricted to |t| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 as a function of t is:\n\nBD\u00b2(t) = 4*(20 + 24 t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2)\n\nWe need to find the minimum of BD\u00b2(t) for t \u2208 [-1, -5/6] \u222a [5/6, 1].\n\nSince the function is even in t, i.e., BD\u00b2(t) = BD\u00b2(-t), we can consider t \u2265 5/6 and find the minimum there.\n\nSo, let's let t \u2265 5/6, and find the minimum of f(t) = (20 + 24 t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nWait, but t\u00b2 is in [25/36, 1], but when t approaches 1, the denominator approaches 0, making f(t) approach infinity. So, the function has a minimum somewhere in [5/6, 1).\n\nTo find the minimum, take the derivative of f(t) with respect to t and set it to zero.\n\nLet me compute f(t):\n\nf(t) = (20 + 24 t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2)\n\nCompute derivative f\u2019(t):\n\nUsing quotient rule:\n\nf\u2019(t) = [ (48t)(1 - t\u00b2) - (20 + 24t\u00b2)(-2t) ] / (1 - t\u00b2)^2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n48t(1 - t\u00b2) + 2t(20 + 24t\u00b2)\n\n= 48t - 48t\u00b3 + 40t + 48t\u00b3\n\n= (48t + 40t) + (-48t\u00b3 + 48t\u00b3)\n\n= 88t\n\nSo, numerator is 88t, denominator is (1 - t\u00b2)^2.\n\nSet f\u2019(t) = 0:\n\n88t / (1 - t\u00b2)^2 = 0\n\nWhich implies 88t = 0 \u2192 t = 0.\n\nBut t = 0 is not in our domain of t \u2265 5/6. So, the function f(t) is increasing for t > 0 because f\u2019(t) is positive when t > 0 (since 88t is positive). So, on the interval [5/6, 1), f(t) is increasing. Therefore, the minimum occurs at t = 5/6.\n\nSo, the minimum BD\u00b2 occurs at t = 5/6.\n\nCompute BD\u00b2 at t = 5/6:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4*(20 + 24*(25/36)) / (1 - (25/36))\n\nFirst compute numerator:\n\n20 + 24*(25/36) = 20 + (24*25)/36\n\n24 and 36 have a common factor of 12: 24/36 = 2/3.\n\nSo, 24*(25)/36 = (2/3)*25 = 50/3 \u2248 16.6667.\n\nSo, numerator: 20 + 50/3 = (60/3 + 50/3) = 110/3.\n\nDenominator: 1 - 25/36 = (36 -25)/36 = 11/36.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(110/3) / (11/36) = 4*(110/3)*(36/11)\n\nSimplify:\n\n4 * (110/3) * (36/11) = 4 * (110 * 36) / (3 * 11)\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n36/3 = 12, 110/11 = 10.\n\nSo, 4 * 10 * 12 = 4 * 120 = 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480.\n\nWait, so BD\u00b2 is 480 when t = 5/6.\n\nBut wait, is this the minimal value?\n\nWait, since f(t) is increasing on [5/6, 1), the minimal value is at t = 5/6, which is 480. So, BD\u00b2 is minimized at 480, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be approaching 480 from above? Wait, no. Wait, since BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because BD\u00b2 cannot be lower than 480. So, 480 is the minimum value.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nCompute f(t) at t = 5/6:\n\nNumerator: 20 + 24*(25/36) = 20 + (24*25)/36.\n\n24*25 = 600; 600/36 = 16.666... which is 50/3.\n\n20 is 60/3, so 60/3 + 50/3 = 110/3.\n\nDenominator: 1 - 25/36 = 11/36.\n\nSo, (110/3) / (11/36) = (110/3) * (36/11) = (110 * 36) / (3 * 11) = (10 * 36) / 3 = (360)/3 = 120.\n\nWait, wait, so f(t) is 120, then BD\u00b2 is 4*120=480. Correct.\n\nBut let me think again: is 480 the minimal BD\u00b2? Because if t increases beyond 5/6, BD\u00b2 increases, as f(t) is increasing. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 can be 480 and above. So, the infimum is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 is always at least 480.\n\nWait, but wait: the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's like the supremum of lower bounds, which is the infimum. So, the infimum is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 can't be lower than 480.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2. So, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is \u2265 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because for every rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480. So, 480 is the minimal value, so the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Let me make sure.\n\nSuppose I have a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is exactly 480. Then, 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 can be 480, so any number less than 480 would be less than some BD\u00b2. So, the question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that would be the infimum, which is 480.\n\nWait, but that can't be because 480 is attainable. So, the infimum is 480, and thus the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Because for any number less than 480, say 480 - \u03b5, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is 480, which is greater than 480 - \u03b5. But the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of all lower bounds. Since BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, any number less than 480 would be a lower bound, but the greatest such number is 480 itself, because it's the infimum.\n\nWait, but 480 is attainable, so the infimum is 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 is always \u2265 480, so 480 is the lower bound, and it's attainable, so it's the greatest lower bound.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, when t = 5/6, sin\u03c6 = 5/6. Then, from equation (1), sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6. So, sin\u03b8 = (-5/6)/ (5/6) )= -1. So, sin\u03b8 = -1, which is \u03b8 = -\u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2.\n\nSo, point A is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). When \u03b8 = -\u03c0/2, sec\u03b8 is undefined because cos(-\u03c0/2) = 0. So, that's a problem.\n\nWait, that suggests that when t = 5/6, sin\u03b8 = -1, which is \u03b8 = -\u03c0/2. But at \u03b8 = -\u03c0/2, cos\u03b8 is zero, so sec\u03b8 is undefined. So, that point isn't on the hyperbola. So, that suggests that t cannot be exactly 5/6 because that would require \u03b8 to be -\u03c0/2, which is not allowed on the hyperbola.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is greater than 480 because t cannot reach exactly 5/6.\n\nWait, that's an important point. Because if t approaches 5/6 from above, then sin\u03c6 approaches 5/6, and sin\u03b8 approaches (-5/6)/(5/6) = -1. But as sin\u03b8 approaches -1, \u03b8 approaches -\u03c0/2, where cos\u03b8 approaches 0, making sec\u03b8 approach infinity. So, point A would go to infinity, which is not possible on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, but in reality, t can approach 5/6 but cannot equal it because that would cause point A to be at infinity. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is actually greater than 480. Therefore, BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480 but cannot actually reach it. So, the infimum is 480, but it's not attainable. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but how can that be? If BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as t approaches 5/6, but never actually reaches it, then 480 is the infimum, but not the minimum. So, the answer is 480, as the infimum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming t can approach 5/6. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 is defined for all real x except where x\u00b2/20 is less than 1, but actually, for hyperbola, x can be any real number except between -a and a, but in this case, a\u00b2 is 20, so x can be any real number except between -sqrt(20) and sqrt(20). Wait, no, the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, so it's a hyperbola opening left and right. So, x can be any real number, but points are only where x\u00b2 \u226520.\n\nWait, so when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, cos\u03b8 approaches 0, so sec\u03b8 approaches infinity, so x approaches infinity. So, points A and C would be at infinity, which isn't allowed. So, \u03b8 cannot be exactly \u03c0/2 or -\u03c0/2, but can approach it. So, in that case, when t approaches 5/6, sin\u03c6 approaches 5/6, so \u03c6 approaches arcsin(5/6), which is a valid angle where cos\u03c6 is sqrt(1 - (25/36)) = sqrt(11/36) = sqrt(11)/6. So, cos\u03c6 is non-zero, so sec\u03c6 is defined.\n\nWait, but when t approaches 5/6, sin\u03b8 approaches -1, so \u03b8 approaches -\u03c0/2, making cos\u03b8 approach 0, so sec\u03b8 approaches infinity. So, point A would be at (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), which would go to (\u00b1infty, \u00b1infty). So, in reality, the point A cannot be at infinity, so the minimal BD\u00b2 cannot actually be 480, but can approach it as \u03b8 approaches -\u03c0/2 and \u03c6 approaches arcsin(5/6). So, the infimum is 480, but it's not attainable. So, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the infimum is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 can be as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480. Therefore, 480 is the answer.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let me consider if there's any other constraint that might make the minimal BD\u00b2 higher than 480.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when t approaches 5/6, point A approaches infinity, which might not be allowed, so perhaps BD\u00b2 cannot actually get as low as 480. But in reality, the hyperbola extends to infinity, so points can be taken as far out as needed, making BD\u00b2 approach 480. So, the infimum is 480, and thus the answer is 480.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus \\(ABCD\\) on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The goal is to find the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi.\n\n1. **Hyperbola Parametrization**: Points on the hyperbola can be parametrized as \\(A(a \\sec\\theta, b \\tan\\theta)\\) and \\(B(a \\sec\\phi, b \\tan\\phi)\\), with \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) being the reflections of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) through the origin.\n\n2. **Diagonals and Perpendicularity**: The diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) are perpendicular, leading to the condition:\n   \\[\n   a^2 \\sec\\theta \\sec\\phi + b^2 \\tan\\theta \\tan\\phi = 0\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(a^2 = 20\\) and \\(b^2 = 24\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   20 \\sec\\theta \\sec\\phi + 24 \\tan\\theta \\tan\\phi = 0\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, this implies:\n   \\[\n   \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = -\\frac{5}{6}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expression for \\(BD^2\\)**: The length of diagonal \\(BD\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = 4(a^2 \\sec^2\\phi + b^2 \\tan^2\\phi)\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(a^2 = 20\\) and \\(b^2 = 24\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = 4\\left(20 \\sec^2\\phi + 24 \\tan^2\\phi\\right)\n   \\]\n   Using trigonometric identities, this becomes:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = 4\\left(\\frac{20 + 24 \\sin^2\\phi}{1 - \\sin^2\\phi}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Minimizing \\(BD^2\\)**: Let \\(t = \\sin\\phi\\). Given \\(\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = -\\frac{5}{6}\\), we find that \\(|t| \\geq \\frac{5}{6}\\). The function to minimize is:\n   \\[\n   BD^2(t) = 4\\left(\\frac{20 + 24t^2}{1 - t^2}\\right)\n   \\]\n   Analyzing this function, we find that the minimum occurs as \\(t\\) approaches \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\), leading to:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 \\to 480\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since \\(BD^2\\) can approach 480 but cannot be less than it, the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is **480**.\n\n\\(\\boxed{480}\\)",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis. The rhombus ABCD has its vertices on this hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, the supremum of BD\u00b2, but the question is phrased as the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, which would be the infimum of BD\u00b2's upper bounds. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should think of it as the minimum possible value that's still an upper bound for BD\u00b2 across all such rhombi. So, perhaps it's the least upper bound, which would be the maximum of BD\u00b2, but the wording is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the question.\n\nWait, it says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's like the maximum lower bound? Or wait, no. If I think about it, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is greater than this number, and this number is the largest such. So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because BD\u00b2 can be made as small as possible, but the problem is asking for the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all such rhombi. So, we need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, and then that would be the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Wait, no. Wait, if we have BD\u00b2 varying, and we need a number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but as large as possible. So, that number is the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2. Because if the infimum is m, then m is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, and any number greater than m would not be less than BD\u00b2 for some rhombus. So, m is the greatest lower bound. So, the problem is to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all such rhombi.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem is to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, but the way it's phrased is a bit tricky.\n\nWait, no. The question is \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be as large as possible, then there's no upper bound. But perhaps BD\u00b2 cannot be too small, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, but the minimal BD\u00b2 is the lower bound. So, the problem is to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is the minimal possible BD\u00b2 for such rhombi.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the rhombus and its properties. Since ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, the diagonals bisect each other. So, if the diagonals are AC and BD, their intersection is at the origin, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, the coordinates of the vertices can be expressed in terms of the endpoints of the diagonals.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, if we let the diagonals be AC and BD, then they are perpendicular. Let me denote the endpoints of diagonal AC as (p, q) and (-p, -q), since the midpoint is the origin. Similarly, the endpoints of BD would be (r, s) and (-r, -s). But wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily aligned with the coordinate axes, so their slopes might not be zero or infinity. So, perhaps a better approach is to consider vectors.\n\nAlternatively, since the rhombus is formed by four points on the hyperbola, with diagonals intersecting at the origin, perhaps the vertices can be considered as points such that if (x, y) is a vertex, then (-x, -y) is the opposite vertex.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes is -1. So, perhaps if I consider points A and C as (x1, y1) and (-x1, -y1), and points B and D as (x2, y2) and (-x2, -y2). Then, the diagonals AC and BD have slopes (y1/x1) and (y2/x2), respectively. For them to be perpendicular, (y1/x1)*(y2/x2) = -1.\n\nBut also, all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, for point A: x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, for point B: x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nNow, in a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, etc. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors, the rhombus can be represented using vectors. Let me think of vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. Then, the vectors OA and OB would be (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). The sides of the rhombus would then be OA + OB, OA - OB, etc. Wait, perhaps.\n\nWait, in a rhombus, the sides can be represented as vectors from the origin to the vertices, but maybe I should think in terms of vectors from one vertex to another.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the sides of the rhombus are equal, so AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to note that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, the vectors of the diagonals are perpendicular. So, if one diagonal is from (x1, y1) to (-x1, -y1), and the other is from (x2, y2) to (-x2, -y2), then their dot product is zero.\n\nWait, the vectors of the diagonals would be (2x1, 2y1) and (2x2, 2y2). The dot product should be zero, so (2x1)(2x2) + (2y1)(2y2) = 0. Simplifying, 4x1x2 + 4y1y2 = 0 \u2192 x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nSo, the condition is x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nMoreover, points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, so:\n\nx1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nx2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2. Let's see, BD is the diagonal from (x2, y2) to (-x2, -y2), so BD has length sqrt[(2x2)^2 + (2y2)^2], so BD\u00b2 = (2x2)^2 + (2y2)^2 = 4x2\u00b2 + 4y2\u00b2.\n\nBut perhaps I should think of BD\u00b2 as the square of the distance between B and D, which are (x2, y2) and (-x2, -y2). So, the distance squared is (x2 - (-x2))\u00b2 + (y2 - (-y2))\u00b2 = (2x2)^2 + (2y2)^2 = 4x2\u00b2 + 4y2\u00b2. So, BD\u00b2 = 4x2\u00b2 + 4y2\u00b2.\n\nWait, but I think in the problem statement, BD is one of the diagonals. So, BD is the diagonal connecting points B and D, which are (x2, y2) and (-x2, -y2). So, BD is the line segment between these two points, and its length squared is indeed 4x2\u00b2 + 4y2\u00b2. So, BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nSo, our target is to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2), given the constraints that x1x2 + y1y2 = 0, and both points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this with variables x1, y1, x2, y2, with the constraints:\n\nx1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nx2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nand x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nAlternatively, since BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2), perhaps we can express x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 in terms of the hyperbola equation and the constraint x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nLet me think: From the hyperbola equation, we have x2\u00b2 = 20(1 + y2\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 = 20 + (20/24)y2\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6)y2\u00b2.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6)y2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 = 20 + (11/6)y2\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 = 4*(20 + (11/6)y2\u00b2) = 80 + (44/6)y2\u00b2 = 80 + (22/3)y2\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is a function of y2\u00b2. But we need to find the minimal BD\u00b2, so we need to minimize y2\u00b2, but subject to the constraint x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nWait, but how are x1 and y1 related to x2 and y2? From the constraint x1x2 + y1y2 = 0. So, if we can express x1 and y1 in terms of x2 and y2, perhaps we can find a relationship.\n\nBut x1 and y1 also lie on the hyperbola, so x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, maybe we can write x1 in terms of x2 and y2 from the constraint.\n\nFrom x1x2 + y1y2 = 0 \u2192 x1 = (-y1y2)/x2, provided x2 \u2260 0.\n\nBut then, substituting x1 into the hyperbola equation:\n\n[(-y1y2/x2)^2]/20 - y1\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, (y1\u00b2 y2\u00b2)/(20 x2\u00b2) - y1\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nLet me factor y1\u00b2:\n\ny1\u00b2 [ (y2\u00b2)/(20 x2\u00b2) - 1/24 ] = 1.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the points on the hyperbola.\n\nFor hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a standard parametrization is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), or using hyperbolic functions, (a cosh t, b sinh t). Let me consider using hyperbolic functions since they might make the algebra easier.\n\nSo, let me set point A as (a cosh t, b sinh t), and point B as (a cosh s, b sinh s), where a\u00b2 = 20 and b\u00b2 = 24. So, a = sqrt(20), b = sqrt(24).\n\nSo, points A and B are on the hyperbola, so their coordinates are (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t) and (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s), respectively.\n\nSince the rhombus has diagonals intersecting at the origin, points C and D would be (-sqrt(20) cosh t, -sqrt(24) sinh t) and (-sqrt(20) cosh s, -sqrt(24) sinh s).\n\nNow, the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular. The diagonals are AC and BD. So, AC is from A to C, which is from (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t) to (-sqrt(20) cosh t, -sqrt(24) sinh t). Similarly, BD is from B to D, from (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s) to (-sqrt(20) cosh s, -sqrt(24) sinh s).\n\nWait, but in reality, the diagonals of a rhombus are the lines connecting opposite vertices. So, in this case, the diagonals would be AC and BD, but in the rhombus, the diagonals are the lines connecting A to C and B to D. But for the rhombus, the diagonals must be perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular.\n\nWait, but in the standard parametrization, I might have to think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the vectors from the origin to A and B must satisfy some condition because the diagonals are AC and BD, which are vectors 2A and 2B, respectively, since C is -A and D is -B. So, the vectors AC and BD are 2A and 2B, so their dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, (2A) \u00b7 (2B) = 0 \u2192 4 (A \u00b7 B) = 0 \u2192 A \u00b7 B = 0.\n\nSo, the vectors A and B must be perpendicular. So, the dot product of A and B is zero.\n\nSo, A \u00b7 B = (sqrt(20) cosh t)(sqrt(20) cosh s) + (sqrt(24) sinh t)(sqrt(24) sinh s) = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(20 cosh t cosh s) + (24 sinh t sinh s) = 0.\n\nSo,\n\n20 cosh t cosh s + 24 sinh t sinh s = 0.\n\nLet me factor this equation:\n\nDivide both sides by 4: 5 cosh t cosh s + 6 sinh t sinh s = 0.\n\nHmm, this is an equation involving hyperbolic functions. Let me see if I can manipulate it.\n\nWe can write this as 5 cosh t cosh s = -6 sinh t sinh s.\n\nDivide both sides by cosh t cosh s (assuming they are non-zero):\n\n5 = -6 (sinh t sinh s)/(cosh t cosh s) = -6 tanh t tanh s.\n\nSo,\n\n5 = -6 tanh t tanh s.\n\nWhich implies tanh t tanh s = -5/6.\n\nHmm, so the product of tanh t and tanh s is -5/6.\n\nNow, our goal is to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD. Since BD is the line from B to D, which is from (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s) to (-sqrt(20) cosh s, -sqrt(24) sinh s). So, the length of BD is sqrt[(2 sqrt(20) cosh s)^2 + (2 sqrt(24) sinh s)^2] = 2 sqrt[20 cosh\u00b2 s + 24 sinh\u00b2 s].\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 is [2 sqrt(20 cosh\u00b2 s + 24 sinh\u00b2 s)]\u00b2 = 4*(20 cosh\u00b2 s + 24 sinh\u00b2 s).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(20 cosh\u00b2 s + 24 sinh\u00b2 s).\n\nWe can factor out 4:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4*20 cosh\u00b2 s + 4*24 sinh\u00b2 s = 80 cosh\u00b2 s + 96 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nBut from the hyperbola equation, cosh\u00b2 s = (1 + sinh\u00b2 s)/cosh\u00b2 s? Wait, no, for hyperbola, cosh\u00b2 t - sinh\u00b2 t = 1, so cosh\u00b2 t = 1 + sinh\u00b2 t.\n\nSo, perhaps we can express cosh\u00b2 s in terms of sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nSo, cosh\u00b2 s = 1 + sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80*(1 + sinh\u00b2 s) + 96 sinh\u00b2 s = 80 + 80 sinh\u00b2 s + 96 sinh\u00b2 s = 80 + 176 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nNow, we need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2, which would occur when sinh\u00b2 s is minimized. Since sinh s can be any real number, sinh\u00b2 s is always non-negative, so the minimal value occurs when sinh\u00b2 s is as small as possible, which is 0.\n\nBut wait, if sinh s = 0, then s = 0. Let's see what that would imply.\n\nIf s = 0, then sinh s = 0, cosh s = 1. So, point B would be (sqrt(20)*1, 0), and point D would be (-sqrt(20), 0). So, BD would be the line from (sqrt(20), 0) to (-sqrt(20), 0), which is along the x-axis. The length of BD would be 2*sqrt(20), so BD\u00b2 = (2*sqrt(20))\u00b2 = 4*20 = 80.\n\nBut wait, let's check if this is possible. If s = 0, then sinh s = 0, cosh s = 1.\n\nFrom the earlier condition, tanh t tanh s = -5/6. But tanh s = tanh 0 = 0, so 0 = -5/6, which is impossible. Therefore, s cannot be zero.\n\nSo, sinh\u00b2 s cannot be zero. Therefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is greater than 80.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find the minimal value by using the condition tanh t tanh s = -5/6.\n\nLet me think: Let me denote u = tanh t and v = tanh s. Then, from the condition, u*v = -5/6.\n\nWe need to express BD\u00b2 in terms of u and v, perhaps.\n\nWait, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nBut sinh s = (v)/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2), since tanh s = v = sinh s / cosh s, and cosh s = 1/sqrt(1 - sinh\u00b2 s) = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2). Therefore, sinh s = v / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2).\n\nSo, sinh\u00b2 s = v\u00b2 / (1 - v\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176*(v\u00b2 / (1 - v\u00b2)).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + [176 v\u00b2]/(1 - v\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, from the condition u*v = -5/6, and u = tanh t, v = tanh s.\n\nBut I also know that from point A lying on the hyperbola, and since A is (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t), the coordinates satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can relate u and v through another equation.\n\nWait, let me think about point A. We have A \u00b7 B = 0.\n\nWait, no, earlier I used that the vectors A and B are perpendicular, so A \u00b7 B = 0. Which gave us the condition 5 cosh t cosh s + 6 sinh t sinh s = 0.\n\nWait, but with hyperbolic identities, maybe we can express this in terms of u and v.\n\nSince u = tanh t = sinh t / cosh t, and v = tanh s = sinh s / cosh s.\n\nSo, sinh t = u cosh t, and sinh s = v cosh s.\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\n5 cosh t cosh s + 6 sinh t sinh s = 0 \u2192 5 cosh t cosh s + 6 (u cosh t)(v cosh s) = 0.\n\nFactor out cosh t cosh s:\n\ncosh t cosh s [5 + 6 u v] = 0.\n\nBut cosh t cosh s is always positive, so 5 + 6 u v = 0 \u2192 6 u v = -5 \u2192 u v = -5/6.\n\nWhich is consistent with what we had before.\n\nSo, u v = -5/6.\n\nNow, our aim is to express BD\u00b2 in terms of v, and then find its minimum.\n\nFrom earlier, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176*(v\u00b2)/(1 - v\u00b2).\n\nSo, let's write BD\u00b2 as a function of v:\n\nBD\u00b2(v) = 80 + [176 v\u00b2]/(1 - v\u00b2).\n\nWe can write this as BD\u00b2(v) = 80 + 176 * [v\u00b2/(1 - v\u00b2)].\n\nLet me denote f(v) = v\u00b2/(1 - v\u00b2). Then, BD\u00b2(v) = 80 + 176 f(v).\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2, so we need to find the minimal value of f(v) given the constraints.\n\nBut what constraints are on v?\n\nFrom u v = -5/6, and u = tanh t, v = tanh s, which implies that u and v are real numbers between -1 and 1.\n\nSo, u \u2208 (-1, 1), v \u2208 (-1, 1).\n\nBut u v = -5/6.\n\nSince u and v are both in (-1, 1), their product can be as low as -1 and as high as 1. But -5/6 is within that range.\n\nSo, we have u = (-5/6)/v.\n\nBut since u must be in (-1, 1), let's see what values v can take.\n\nSo, u = (-5/6)/v must satisfy |u| \u2264 1 \u2192 |(-5/6)/v| \u2264 1 \u2192 |5/(6v)| \u2264 1 \u2192 |v| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, v must satisfy |v| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, v \u2208 [-1, -5/6] \u222a [5/6, 1].\n\nTherefore, v can be between -1 and -5/6 or between 5/6 and 1.\n\nNow, our function f(v) = v\u00b2/(1 - v\u00b2). Let's analyze this function.\n\nFirst, note that f(v) is even, so f(v) = f(-v). Therefore, we can consider v \u2208 [5/6, 1], and the function will behave symmetrically for negative v.\n\nSo, let's consider v \u2208 [5/6, 1].\n\nCompute f(v) = v\u00b2/(1 - v\u00b2).\n\nWe can write this as f(v) = [v\u00b2]/(1 - v\u00b2) = [v\u00b2]/[(1 - v)(1 + v)].\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute its derivative to find minima or maxima.\n\nLet me compute f'(v):\n\nf(v) = v\u00b2 / (1 - v\u00b2).\n\nf'(v) = [2v(1 - v\u00b2) - v\u00b2*(-2v)] / (1 - v\u00b2)^2.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n2v(1 - v\u00b2) + 2v\u00b3 = 2v - 2v\u00b3 + 2v\u00b3 = 2v.\n\nSo, f'(v) = 2v / (1 - v\u00b2)^2.\n\nSince v \u2208 [5/6, 1), the numerator 2v is positive, and denominator is positive, so f'(v) > 0 for v \u2208 (5/6, 1).\n\nSo, f(v) is increasing on [5/6, 1).\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of f(v) on [5/6, 1) occurs at v = 5/6.\n\nSimilarly, for v \u2208 [-1, -5/6], f(v) = v\u00b2/(1 - v\u00b2) is the same as for v = |v| \u2208 [5/6, 1], so f(v) is also increasing on [-1, -5/6], meaning the minimal value is at v = -5/6.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of f(v) is f(5/6) = (25/36)/(1 - 25/36) = (25/36)/(11/36) = 25/11.\n\nSimilarly, for v = -5/6, same result.\n\nSo, the minimal f(v) is 25/11.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 80 + 176*(25/11).\n\nCompute 176*(25/11):\n\n176 divided by 11 is 16, so 16*25 = 400.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 400 = 480.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 176*(25/11) is (176/11)*25 = 16*25 = 400.\n\nYes, so BD\u00b2 = 80 + 400 = 480.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, BD\u00b2 can be as large as possible, but the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480. So, 480 is the minimal value of BD\u00b2. Therefore, 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 \u2265 480. So, any number less than 480 would not satisfy the condition for rhombi where BD\u00b2 is exactly 480.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem is asking for the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, then 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2. So, for any number greater than 480, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is 480, which is less than that number. Therefore, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480. Because for any number greater than 480, it's not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi (since BD\u00b2 can be 480). But if we take 480 itself, it's less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi except when BD\u00b2 is exactly 480, but the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" Hmm, but 480 is the minimal value. So, 480 \u2264 BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Therefore, the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Because 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2, and for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480. So, 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2. But the question asks for the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 is always at least 480, then 480 is the greatest lower bound. So, the number we are looking for is 480.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be 480, then 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because for the rhombus where BD\u00b2 is 480, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2. Therefore, perhaps the number we are looking for is the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 480, but since 480 is attainable, the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 would be 480. But wait, 480 is the infimum. So, the numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi must be less than or equal to 480. But since 480 is attainable, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. But wait, no. Because for the rhombus where BD\u00b2 is 480, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2. So, the number we are looking for is the supremum of numbers m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, m must be less than 480, because for the rhombus where BD\u00b2 is 480, m must be less than 480. So, the supremum of such m is 480. Because m can approach 480 as much as possible, but can't reach it. So, the answer is 480, but expressed as the limit.\n\nWait, but 480 is attainable, so the supremum of m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Because for any m < 480, m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, since BD\u00b2 is at least 480. But 480 itself is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because when BD\u00b2 is exactly 480, 480 is not less than 480.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nWe need to find the greatest real number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, m must be less than BD\u00b2 for every possible rhombus. So, the maximum possible m is the infimum of BD\u00b2 across all rhombi.\n\nBecause if the infimum is 480, then for any m < 480, m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, since BD\u00b2 \u2265 480. But 480 itself is equal to BD\u00b2 for some rhombus, so m can't be 480 because then m is not less than BD\u00b2 for that rhombus. So, the greatest m is the infimum, which is 480, but since it's attainable, m must be less than 480. Therefore, the supremum of such m is 480. But in terms of real numbers, 480 is the least upper bound for m, but m can't actually reach 480.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of limits. As the rhombus approaches the minimal BD\u00b2 of 480, m approaches 480, but never actually reaches it. So, the supremum is 480, but it's not attainable. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to frame it differently.\n\nIf I denote the set S as {BD\u00b2 | ABCD is a rhombus on the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin}, then S is a set of real numbers starting from 480 upwards. So, the infimum of S is 480, and the minimum is also 480 because it's attainable. Therefore, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 \u2265 480. So, the greatest number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the infimum of S, which is 480. But since 480 is attainable, m cannot be 480 because then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, m would not be less than BD\u00b2. Therefore, the supremum of all such m is 480, but m can't actually be 480. So, the answer would be 480, but written as the limit.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, since BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, m must be less than 480. Therefore, the greatest such m is approaching 480, but not reaching it. So, the supremum is 480, but it's not included. So, technically, the answer would be 480, but I'm not sure if it's acceptable to write 480 as the answer since it's attainable. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 480, but expressed as the limit, so the problem expects 480 as the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nWe found that BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nThen, from the condition, we have u*v = -5/6, where u = tanh t and v = tanh s.\n\nWe then expressed BD\u00b2 in terms of v, found that the minimal f(v) is 25/11, leading to BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176*(25/11) = 80 + 400 = 480.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, so the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480. So, 480 is the infimum, and the answer is 480.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis. The rhombus ABCD has its vertices on this hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, the supremum of BD\u00b2, but the question is phrased as the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, which would be the infimum of BD\u00b2's upper bounds. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should think of it as the minimum possible value that's still an upper bound for BD\u00b2 across all such rhombi. So, perhaps it's the least upper bound, which would be the maximum of BD\u00b2, but the wording is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the question.\n\nWait, it says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's like the maximum lower bound? Or wait, no. If I think about it, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is greater than this number, and this number is the largest such. So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because BD\u00b2 can be made as small as possible, but the problem is asking for the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all such rhombi. So, we need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, and then that would be the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Wait, no. Wait, if we have BD\u00b2 varying, and we need a number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but as large as possible. So, that number is the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2. Because if the infimum is m, then m is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, and any number greater than m would not be less than BD\u00b2 for some rhombus. So, m is the greatest lower bound. So, the problem is to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all such rhombi.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem is to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, but the way it's phrased is a bit tricky.\n\nWait, no. The question is \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be as large as possible, then there's no upper bound. But perhaps BD\u00b2 cannot be too small, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, but the minimal BD\u00b2 is the lower bound. So, the problem is to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is the minimal possible BD\u00b2 for such rhombi.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the rhombus and its properties. Since ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, the diagonals bisect each other. So, if the diagonals are AC and BD, their intersection is at the origin, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, the coordinates of the vertices can be expressed in terms of the endpoints of the diagonals.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, if we let the diagonals be AC and BD, then they are perpendicular. Let me denote the endpoints of diagonal AC as (p, q) and (-p, -q), since the midpoint is the origin. Similarly, the endpoints of BD would be (r, s) and (-r, -s). But wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily aligned with the coordinate axes, so their slopes might not be zero or infinity. So, perhaps a better approach is to consider vectors.\n\nAlternatively, since the rhombus is formed by four points on the hyperbola, with diagonals intersecting at the origin, perhaps the vertices can be considered as points such that if (x, y) is a vertex, then (-x, -y) is the opposite vertex.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes is -1. So, perhaps if I consider points A and C as (x1, y1) and (-x1, -y1), and points B and D as (x2, y2) and (-x2, -y2). Then, the diagonals AC and BD have slopes (y1/x1) and (y2/x2), respectively. For them to be perpendicular, (y1/x1)*(y2/x2) = -1.\n\nBut also, all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, for point A: x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, for point B: x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nNow, in a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, etc. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors, the rhombus can be represented using vectors. Let me think of vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. Then, the vectors OA and OB would be (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). The sides of the rhombus would then be OA + OB, OA - OB, etc. Wait, perhaps.\n\nWait, in a rhombus, the sides can be represented as vectors from the origin to the vertices, but maybe I should think in terms of vectors from one vertex to another.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the sides of the rhombus are equal, so AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to note that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, the vectors of the diagonals are perpendicular. So, if one diagonal is from (x1, y1) to (-x1, -y1), and the other is from (x2, y2) to (-x2, -y2), then their dot product is zero.\n\nWait, the vectors of the diagonals would be (2x1, 2y1) and (2x2, 2y2). The dot product should be zero, so (2x1)(2x2) + (2y1)(2y2) = 0. Simplifying, 4x1x2 + 4y1y2 = 0 \u2192 x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nSo, the condition is x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nMoreover, points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, so:\n\nx1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nx2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2. Let's see, BD is the diagonal from (x2, y2) to (-x2, -y2), so BD has length sqrt[(2x2)^2 + (2y2)^2], so BD\u00b2 = (2x2)^2 + (2y2)^2 = 4x2\u00b2 + 4y2\u00b2.\n\nBut perhaps I should think of BD\u00b2 as the square of the distance between B and D, which are (x2, y2) and (-x2, -y2). So, the distance squared is (x2 - (-x2))\u00b2 + (y2 - (-y2))\u00b2 = (2x2)^2 + (2y2)^2 = 4x2\u00b2 + 4y2\u00b2. So, BD\u00b2 = 4x2\u00b2 + 4y2\u00b2.\n\nWait, but I think in the problem statement, BD is one of the diagonals. So, BD is the diagonal connecting points B and D, which are (x2, y2) and (-x2, -y2). So, BD is the line segment between these two points, and its length squared is indeed 4x2\u00b2 + 4y2\u00b2. So, BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nSo, our target is to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2), given the constraints that x1x2 + y1y2 = 0, and both points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this with variables x1, y1, x2, y2, with the constraints:\n\nx1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nx2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nand x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nAlternatively, since BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2), perhaps we can express x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 in terms of the hyperbola equation and the constraint x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nLet me think: From the hyperbola equation, we have x2\u00b2 = 20(1 + y2\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 = 20 + (20/24)y2\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6)y2\u00b2.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6)y2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 = 20 + (11/6)y2\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 = 4*(20 + (11/6)y2\u00b2) = 80 + (44/6)y2\u00b2 = 80 + (22/3)y2\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is a function of y2\u00b2. But we need to find the minimal BD\u00b2, so we need to minimize y2\u00b2, but subject to the constraint x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nWait, but how are x1 and y1 related to x2 and y2? From the constraint x1x2 + y1y2 = 0. So, if we can express x1 and y1 in terms of x2 and y2, perhaps we can find a relationship.\n\nBut x1 and y1 also lie on the hyperbola, so x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, maybe we can write x1 in terms of x2 and y2 from the constraint.\n\nFrom x1x2 + y1y2 = 0 \u2192 x1 = (-y1y2)/x2, provided x2 \u2260 0.\n\nBut then, substituting x1 into the hyperbola equation:\n\n[(-y1y2/x2)^2]/20 - y1\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, (y1\u00b2 y2\u00b2)/(20 x2\u00b2) - y1\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nLet me factor y1\u00b2:\n\ny1\u00b2 [ (y2\u00b2)/(20 x2\u00b2) - 1/24 ] = 1.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the points on the hyperbola.\n\nFor hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a standard parametrization is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), or using hyperbolic functions, (a cosh t, b sinh t). Let me consider using hyperbolic functions since they might make the algebra easier.\n\nSo, let me set point A as (a cosh t, b sinh t), and point B as (a cosh s, b sinh s), where a\u00b2 = 20 and b\u00b2 = 24. So, a = sqrt(20), b = sqrt(24).\n\nSo, points A and B are on the hyperbola, so their coordinates are (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t) and (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s), respectively.\n\nSince the rhombus has diagonals intersecting at the origin, points C and D would be (-sqrt(20) cosh t, -sqrt(24) sinh t) and (-sqrt(20) cosh s, -sqrt(24) sinh s).\n\nNow, the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular. The diagonals are AC and BD. So, AC is from A to C, which is from (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t) to (-sqrt(20) cosh t, -sqrt(24) sinh t). Similarly, BD is from B to D, from (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s) to (-sqrt(20) cosh s, -sqrt(24) sinh s).\n\nWait, but in reality, the diagonals of a rhombus are the lines connecting opposite vertices. So, in this case, the diagonals would be AC and BD, but in the rhombus, the diagonals are the lines connecting A to C and B to D. But for the rhombus, the diagonals must be perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular.\n\nWait, but in the standard parametrization, I might have to think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the vectors from the origin to A and B must satisfy some condition because the diagonals are AC and BD, which are vectors 2A and 2B, respectively, since C is -A and D is -B. So, the vectors AC and BD are 2A and 2B, so their dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, (2A) \u00b7 (2B) = 0 \u2192 4 (A \u00b7 B) = 0 \u2192 A \u00b7 B = 0.\n\nSo, the vectors A and B must be perpendicular. So, the dot product of A and B is zero.\n\nSo, A \u00b7 B = (sqrt(20) cosh t)(sqrt(20) cosh s) + (sqrt(24) sinh t)(sqrt(24) sinh s) = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(20 cosh t cosh s) + (24 sinh t sinh s) = 0.\n\nSo,\n\n20 cosh t cosh s + 24 sinh t sinh s = 0.\n\nLet me factor this equation:\n\nDivide both sides by 4: 5 cosh t cosh s + 6 sinh t sinh s = 0.\n\nHmm, this is an equation involving hyperbolic functions. Let me see if I can manipulate it.\n\nWe can write this as 5 cosh t cosh s = -6 sinh t sinh s.\n\nDivide both sides by cosh t cosh s (assuming they are non-zero):\n\n5 = -6 (sinh t sinh s)/(cosh t cosh s) = -6 tanh t tanh s.\n\nSo,\n\n5 = -6 tanh t tanh s.\n\nWhich implies tanh t tanh s = -5/6.\n\nHmm, so the product of tanh t and tanh s is -5/6.\n\nNow, our goal is to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD. Since BD is the line from B to D, which is from (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s) to (-sqrt(20) cosh s, -sqrt(24) sinh s). So, the length of BD is sqrt[(2 sqrt(20) cosh s)^2 + (2 sqrt(24) sinh s)^2] = 2 sqrt[20 cosh\u00b2 s + 24 sinh\u00b2 s].\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 is [2 sqrt(20 cosh\u00b2 s + 24 sinh\u00b2 s)]\u00b2 = 4*(20 cosh\u00b2 s + 24 sinh\u00b2 s).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(20 cosh\u00b2 s + 24 sinh\u00b2 s).\n\nWe can factor out 4:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4*20 cosh\u00b2 s + 4*24 sinh\u00b2 s = 80 cosh\u00b2 s + 96 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nBut from the hyperbola equation, cosh\u00b2 s = (1 + sinh\u00b2 s)/cosh\u00b2 s? Wait, no, for hyperbola, cosh\u00b2 t - sinh\u00b2 t = 1, so cosh\u00b2 t = 1 + sinh\u00b2 t.\n\nSo, perhaps we can express cosh\u00b2 s in terms of sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nSo, cosh\u00b2 s = 1 + sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80*(1 + sinh\u00b2 s) + 96 sinh\u00b2 s = 80 + 80 sinh\u00b2 s + 96 sinh\u00b2 s = 80 + 176 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nNow, we need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2, which would occur when sinh\u00b2 s is minimized. Since sinh s can be any real number, sinh\u00b2 s is always non-negative, so the minimal value occurs when sinh\u00b2 s is as small as possible, which is 0.\n\nBut wait, if sinh s = 0, then s = 0. Let's see what that would imply.\n\nIf s = 0, then sinh s = 0, cosh s = 1. So, point B would be (sqrt(20)*1, 0), and point D would be (-sqrt(20), 0). So, BD would be the line from (sqrt(20), 0) to (-sqrt(20), 0), which is along the x-axis. The length of BD would be 2*sqrt(20), so BD\u00b2 = (2*sqrt(20))\u00b2 = 4*20 = 80.\n\nBut wait, let's check if this is possible. If s = 0, then sinh s = 0, cosh s = 1.\n\nFrom the earlier condition, tanh t tanh s = -5/6. But tanh s = tanh 0 = 0, so 0 = -5/6, which is impossible. Therefore, s cannot be zero.\n\nSo, sinh\u00b2 s cannot be zero. Therefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is greater than 80.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find the minimal value by using the condition tanh t tanh s = -5/6.\n\nLet me think: Let me denote u = tanh t and v = tanh s. Then, from the condition, u*v = -5/6.\n\nWe need to express BD\u00b2 in terms of u and v, perhaps.\n\nWait, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nBut sinh s = (v)/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2), since tanh s = v = sinh s / cosh s, and cosh s = 1/sqrt(1 - sinh\u00b2 s) = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2). Therefore, sinh s = v / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2).\n\nSo, sinh\u00b2 s = v\u00b2 / (1 - v\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176*(v\u00b2 / (1 - v\u00b2)).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + [176 v\u00b2]/(1 - v\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, from the condition u*v = -5/6, and u = tanh t, v = tanh s.\n\nBut I also know that from point A lying on the hyperbola, and since A is (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t), the coordinates satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can relate u and v through another equation.\n\nWait, let me think about point A. We have A \u00b7 B = 0.\n\nWait, no, earlier I used that the vectors A and B are perpendicular, so A \u00b7 B = 0. Which gave us the condition 5 cosh t cosh s + 6 sinh t sinh s = 0.\n\nWait, but with hyperbolic identities, maybe we can express this in terms of u and v.\n\nSince u = tanh t = sinh t / cosh t, and v = tanh s = sinh s / cosh s.\n\nSo, sinh t = u cosh t, and sinh s = v cosh s.\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\n5 cosh t cosh s + 6 sinh t sinh s = 0 \u2192 5 cosh t cosh s + 6 (u cosh t)(v cosh s) = 0.\n\nFactor out cosh t cosh s:\n\ncosh t cosh s [5 + 6 u v] = 0.\n\nBut cosh t cosh s is always positive, so 5 + 6 u v = 0 \u2192 6 u v = -5 \u2192 u v = -5/6.\n\nWhich is consistent with what we had before.\n\nSo, u v = -5/6.\n\nNow, our aim is to express BD\u00b2 in terms of v, and then find its minimum.\n\nFrom earlier, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176*(v\u00b2)/(1 - v\u00b2).\n\nSo, let's write BD\u00b2 as a function of v:\n\nBD\u00b2(v) = 80 + [176 v\u00b2]/(1 - v\u00b2).\n\nWe can write this as BD\u00b2(v) = 80 + 176 * [v\u00b2/(1 - v\u00b2)].\n\nLet me denote f(v) = v\u00b2/(1 - v\u00b2). Then, BD\u00b2(v) = 80 + 176 f(v).\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2, so we need to find the minimal value of f(v) given the constraints.\n\nBut what constraints are on v?\n\nFrom u v = -5/6, and u = tanh t, v = tanh s, which implies that u and v are real numbers between -1 and 1.\n\nSo, u \u2208 (-1, 1), v \u2208 (-1, 1).\n\nBut u v = -5/6.\n\nSince u and v are both in (-1, 1), their product can be as low as -1 and as high as 1. But -5/6 is within that range.\n\nSo, we have u = (-5/6)/v.\n\nBut since u must be in (-1, 1), let's see what values v can take.\n\nSo, u = (-5/6)/v must satisfy |u| \u2264 1 \u2192 |(-5/6)/v| \u2264 1 \u2192 |5/(6v)| \u2264 1 \u2192 |v| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, v must satisfy |v| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, v \u2208 [-1, -5/6] \u222a [5/6, 1].\n\nTherefore, v can be between -1 and -5/6 or between 5/6 and 1.\n\nNow, our function f(v) = v\u00b2/(1 - v\u00b2). Let's analyze this function.\n\nFirst, note that f(v) is even, so f(v) = f(-v). Therefore, we can consider v \u2208 [5/6, 1], and the function will behave symmetrically for negative v.\n\nSo, let's consider v \u2208 [5/6, 1].\n\nCompute f(v) = v\u00b2/(1 - v\u00b2).\n\nWe can write this as f(v) = [v\u00b2]/(1 - v\u00b2) = [v\u00b2]/[(1 - v)(1 + v)].\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute its derivative to find minima or maxima.\n\nLet me compute f'(v):\n\nf(v) = v\u00b2 / (1 - v\u00b2).\n\nf'(v) = [2v(1 - v\u00b2) - v\u00b2*(-2v)] / (1 - v\u00b2)^2.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n2v(1 - v\u00b2) + 2v\u00b3 = 2v - 2v\u00b3 + 2v\u00b3 = 2v.\n\nSo, f'(v) = 2v / (1 - v\u00b2)^2.\n\nSince v \u2208 [5/6, 1), the numerator 2v is positive, and denominator is positive, so f'(v) > 0 for v \u2208 (5/6, 1).\n\nSo, f(v) is increasing on [5/6, 1).\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of f(v) on [5/6, 1) occurs at v = 5/6.\n\nSimilarly, for v \u2208 [-1, -5/6], f(v) = v\u00b2/(1 - v\u00b2) is the same as for v = |v| \u2208 [5/6, 1], so f(v) is also increasing on [-1, -5/6], meaning the minimal value is at v = -5/6.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of f(v) is f(5/6) = (25/36)/(1 - 25/36) = (25/36)/(11/36) = 25/11.\n\nSimilarly, for v = -5/6, same result.\n\nSo, the minimal f(v) is 25/11.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 80 + 176*(25/11).\n\nCompute 176*(25/11):\n\n176 divided by 11 is 16, so 16*25 = 400.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 400 = 480.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 176*(25/11) is (176/11)*25 = 16*25 = 400.\n\nYes, so BD\u00b2 = 80 + 400 = 480.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, BD\u00b2 can be as large as possible, but the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480. So, 480 is the minimal value of BD\u00b2. Therefore, 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 \u2265 480. So, any number less than 480 would not satisfy the condition for rhombi where BD\u00b2 is exactly 480.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem is asking for the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, then 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2. So, for any number greater than 480, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is 480, which is less than that number. Therefore, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480. Because for any number greater than 480, it's not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi (since BD\u00b2 can be 480). But if we take 480 itself, it's less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi except when BD\u00b2 is exactly 480, but the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" Hmm, but 480 is the minimal value. So, 480 \u2264 BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Therefore, the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Because 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2, and for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480. So, 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2. But the question asks for the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 is always at least 480, then 480 is the greatest lower bound. So, the number we are looking for is 480.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be 480, then 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because for the rhombus where BD\u00b2 is 480, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2. Therefore, perhaps the number we are looking for is the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 480, but since 480 is attainable, the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 would be 480. But wait, 480 is the infimum. So, the numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi must be less than or equal to 480. But since 480 is attainable, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. But wait, no. Because for the rhombus where BD\u00b2 is 480, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2. So, the number we are looking for is the supremum of numbers m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, m must be less than 480, because for the rhombus where BD\u00b2 is 480, m must be less than 480. So, the supremum of such m is 480. Because m can approach 480 as much as possible, but can't reach it. So, the answer is 480, but expressed as the limit.\n\nWait, but 480 is attainable, so the supremum of m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Because for any m < 480, m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, since BD\u00b2 is at least 480. But 480 itself is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because when BD\u00b2 is exactly 480, 480 is not less than 480.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nWe need to find the greatest real number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, m must be less than BD\u00b2 for every possible rhombus. So, the maximum possible m is the infimum of BD\u00b2 across all rhombi.\n\nBecause if the infimum is 480, then for any m < 480, m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, since BD\u00b2 \u2265 480. But 480 itself is equal to BD\u00b2 for some rhombus, so m can't be 480 because then m is not less than BD\u00b2 for that rhombus. So, the greatest m is the infimum, which is 480, but since it's attainable, m must be less than 480. Therefore, the supremum of such m is 480. But in terms of real numbers, 480 is the least upper bound for m, but m can't actually reach 480.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of limits. As the rhombus approaches the minimal BD\u00b2 of 480, m approaches 480, but never actually reaches it. So, the supremum is 480, but it's not attainable. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to frame it differently.\n\nIf I denote the set S as {BD\u00b2 | ABCD is a rhombus on the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin}, then S is a set of real numbers starting from 480 upwards. So, the infimum of S is 480, and the minimum is also 480 because it's attainable. Therefore, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 \u2265 480. So, the greatest number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the infimum of S, which is 480. But since 480 is attainable, m cannot be 480 because then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, m would not be less than BD\u00b2. Therefore, the supremum of all such m is 480, but m can't actually be 480. So, the answer would be 480, but written as the limit.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, since BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, m must be less than 480. Therefore, the greatest such m is approaching 480, but not reaching it. So, the supremum is 480, but it's not included. So, technically, the answer would be 480, but I'm not sure if it's acceptable to write 480 as the answer since it's attainable. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 480, but expressed as the limit, so the problem expects 480 as the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nWe found that BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nThen, from the condition, we have u*v = -5/6, where u = tanh t and v = tanh s.\n\nWe then expressed BD\u00b2 in terms of v, found that the minimal f(v) is 25/11, leading to BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176*(25/11) = 80 + 400 = 480.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, so the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480. So, 480 is the infimum, and the answer is 480.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all rhombi \\( ABCD \\) inscribed in the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin.\n\n1. **Hyperbola and Rhombus Properties**:\n   - The hyperbola is centered at the origin with \\( a^2 = 20 \\) and \\( b^2 = 24 \\).\n   - The rhombus has diagonals intersecting at the origin, implying the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other.\n\n2. **Parametrization**:\n   - Points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) on the hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions: \\( A = (\\sqrt{20} \\cosh t, \\sqrt{24} \\sinh t) \\) and \\( B = (\\sqrt{20} \\cosh s, \\sqrt{24} \\sinh s) \\).\n   - The condition for perpendicular diagonals leads to \\( \\tanh t \\cdot \\tanh s = -\\frac{5}{6} \\).\n\n3. **Diagonal Length Calculation**:\n   - The length of diagonal \\( BD \\) is calculated as \\( BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2) \\).\n   - Substituting \\( x_2 = \\sqrt{20} \\cosh s \\) and \\( y_2 = \\sqrt{24} \\sinh s \\), we find \\( BD^2 = 80 + 176 \\sinh^2 s \\).\n\n4. **Minimizing \\( BD^2 \\)**:\n   - Using the condition \\( \\tanh t \\cdot \\tanh s = -\\frac{5}{6} \\), we express \\( \\sinh^2 s \\) in terms of \\( v = \\tanh s \\).\n   - The minimal value of \\( BD^2 \\) occurs when \\( \\sinh^2 s \\) is minimized, leading to \\( BD^2 = 480 \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The minimal value of \\( BD^2 \\) is \\( 480 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says:\n\nLet \\( A \\), \\( B \\), \\( C \\), and \\( D \\) be points on the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\) such that \\( ABCD \\) is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombi.\n\nHmm, okay. So, first, let's parse this. We have a hyperbola, and four points on it forming a rhombus. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. We need to find the greatest number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombi. So, essentially, we're looking for the infimum of \\( BD^2 \\) or something like that? Wait, no, the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all rhombi. So, maybe we need to find the minimum possible value of \\( BD^2 \\), and then the answer would be just below that? Or perhaps we need to find the supremum of the lower bounds of \\( BD^2 \\)?\n\nWait, no, the wording is a bit different. It says, \"the greatest real number that is less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of all numbers \\( m \\) such that \\( m < BD^2 \\) for every rhombus. So, \\( m \\) is the maximum lower bound for \\( BD^2 \\). So, essentially, it's the infimum of \\( BD^2 \\) across all such rhombi. Because if \\( m \\) is less than every \\( BD^2 \\), then the greatest such \\( m \\) is the infimum.\n\nSo, our goal is to find the infimum of \\( BD^2 \\) for all rhombi \\( ABCD \\) on the given hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin.\n\nAlright, let's get started.\n\nFirst, let's recall some properties of rhombuses. In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, actually, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.\n\nSo, in this case, the diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if \\( AC \\) and \\( BD \\) are the diagonals, then the midpoint of \\( AC \\) is the origin, and the midpoint of \\( BD \\) is also the origin.\n\nGiven that all four points lie on the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nSo, let's denote the points \\( A \\), \\( B \\), \\( C \\), and \\( D \\) as points on the hyperbola. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, we can think of the coordinates of the points as follows: If \\( A \\) is a point \\( (x, y) \\), then the point opposite to it across the origin would be \\( C = (-x, -y) \\). Similarly, if \\( B \\) is a point \\( (p, q) \\), then \\( D = (-p, -q) \\).\n\nSo, the four points are \\( A = (x, y) \\), \\( B = (p, q) \\), \\( C = (-x, -y) \\), \\( D = (-p, -q) \\).\n\nNow, since \\( ABCD \\) is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) must equal the distance between \\( B \\) and \\( C \\), and so on.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the properties of the rhombus. Since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, the vectors \\( \\vec{AC} \\) and \\( \\vec{BD} \\) must be perpendicular. So, their dot product is zero.\n\nBut wait, let's think in terms of coordinates. The vectors \\( AC \\) go from \\( A \\) to \\( C \\), which is \\( (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y) \\). Similarly, vector \\( BD \\) is \\( (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q) \\).\n\nWait, no, actually, the vectors of the diagonals are \\( AC \\) and \\( BD \\). So, \\( AC \\) is from \\( A \\) to \\( C \\), which is \\( (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y) \\). Similarly, \\( BD \\) is from \\( B \\) to \\( D \\), which is \\( (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q) \\).\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. So,\n\n\\( (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 4xp + 4yq = 0 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n\\( xp + yq = 0 \\)  --- (1)\n\nSo, equation (1) is a necessary condition for the diagonals to be perpendicular.\n\nAdditionally, since \\( ABCD \\) is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. Let's compute the lengths of sides \\( AB \\), \\( BC \\), etc., and set them equal.\n\nCompute \\( AB \\):\n\nPoint \\( A = (x, y) \\), Point \\( B = (p, q) \\).\n\nDistance squared: \\( (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 \\).\n\nCompute \\( BC \\):\n\nPoint \\( B = (p, q) \\), Point \\( C = (-x, -y) \\).\n\nDistance squared: \\( (-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2 \\).\n\nSimilarly, compute \\( CD \\):\n\nPoint \\( C = (-x, -y) \\), Point \\( D = (-p, -q) \\).\n\nDistance squared: \\( (-p + x)^2 + (-q + y)^2 \\).\n\nAnd \\( DA \\):\n\nPoint \\( D = (-p, -q) \\), Point \\( A = (x, y) \\).\n\nDistance squared: \\( (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2 \\).\n\nSince all sides are equal, set \\( AB^2 = BC^2 \\), \\( BC^2 = CD^2 \\), etc.\n\nLet me compute \\( AB^2 = (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 \\).\n\nCompute \\( BC^2 = (-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2 = (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2 \\).\n\nSet \\( AB^2 = BC^2 \\):\n\n\\( (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2 \\).\n\nExpand both sides:\n\nLeft: \\( p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2 \\).\n\nRight: \\( p\u00b2 + 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qy + y\u00b2 \\).\n\nSubtract left from right:\n\n\\( (p\u00b2 + 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qy + y\u00b2) - (p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2) \\) = \\( 4px + 4qy = 0 \\).\n\nSo, \\( 4px + 4qy = 0 \\) => \\( px + qy = 0 \\) --- (2).\n\nWait, equation (2) is similar to equation (1). Equation (1) was \\( xp + yq = 0 \\). So, equation (1) and equation (2) are the same. So, that doesn't give us new information.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should set another pair of sides equal. Let's set \\( AB^2 = AD^2 \\).\n\nWait, \\( AD \\) is from \\( A = (x, y) \\) to \\( D = (-p, -q) \\). So, distance squared is \\( (-p - x)^2 + (-q - y)^2 = (p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2 \\).\n\nWait, but \\( AB^2 = (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 \\), and \\( AD^2 = (p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2 \\). So, set them equal:\n\n\\( (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2 \\).\n\nWait, but that's the same as setting \\( AB^2 = BC^2 \\), which we already did, giving the same equation. So, perhaps all the equal side conditions lead to the same equation, so we might need another condition.\n\nWait, maybe instead of equating side lengths, I should think about vectors. Since it's a rhombus, the vectors \\( \\vec{AB} \\) and \\( \\vec{AD} \\) should have the same length and the angle between them should be such that the figure closes properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parameterize the points on the hyperbola.\n\nSince all four points lie on the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\), each point must satisfy this equation.\n\nSo, \\( A = (x, y) \\) satisfies \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( B = (p, q) \\) satisfies \\( \\frac{p^2}{20} - \\frac{q^2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nGiven that, and equation (1) \\( xp + yq = 0 \\), perhaps we can express one variable in terms of another.\n\nLet me think about how to parameterize points on a hyperbola. Hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions. For example, for the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \\), a parametrization is \\( x = a \\cosh \\theta \\), \\( y = b \\sinh \\theta \\). Alternatively, using rational parametrization, but hyperbolic functions might be more straightforward here.\n\nSo, let's set:\n\nFor point \\( A \\), let \\( x = \\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\theta \\), \\( y = \\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\theta \\).\n\nSimilarly, for point \\( B \\), let \\( p = \\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\phi \\), \\( q = \\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\phi \\).\n\nSince the hyperbola is symmetric, perhaps we can find a relationship between \\( \\theta \\) and \\( \\phi \\) based on equation (1): \\( xp + yq = 0 \\).\n\nSubstituting the parametrizations:\n\n\\( (\\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\theta)(\\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\phi) + (\\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\theta)(\\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\phi) = 0 \\).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 20 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi + 24 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi = 0 \\).\n\nLet me factor this:\n\n\\( 20 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi + 24 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, can I write this as a multiple of hyperbolic identities?\n\nRecall that \\( \\cosh(a + b) = \\cosh a \\cosh b + \\sinh a \\sinh b \\).\n\nSo, if we factor the equation, it's similar to:\n\n\\( 20 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) + (24 - 20) \\sinh a \\sinh b = 0 \\). Wait, no, that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, let's factor out common terms.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n\\( 20 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi + 24 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi = 0 \\).\n\nDivide both sides by, say, 4:\n\n\\( 5 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi + 6 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, this looks like a linear combination of hyperbolic functions. Maybe we can express this in terms of exponentials.\n\nRecall that \\( \\cosh t = \\frac{e^t + e^{-t}}{2} \\), \\( \\sinh t = \\frac{e^t - e^{-t}}{2} \\).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n\\( 5 \\left( \\frac{e^{\\theta} + e^{-\\theta}}{2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{e^{\\phi} + e^{-\\phi}}{2} \\right) + 6 \\left( \\frac{e^{\\theta} - e^{-\\theta}}{2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{e^{\\phi} - e^{-\\phi}}{2} \\right) = 0 \\).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: \\( 5 \\times \\frac{(e^{\\theta} + e^{-\\theta})(e^{\\phi} + e^{-\\phi})}{4} \\).\n\nSecond term: \\( 6 \\times \\frac{(e^{\\theta} - e^{-\\theta})(e^{\\phi} - e^{-\\phi})}{4} \\).\n\nSo, let's compute both:\n\nFirst term numerator: \\( (e^{\\theta} + e^{-\\theta})(e^{\\phi} + e^{-\\phi}) = e^{\\theta + \\phi} + e^{-\\theta + \\phi} + e^{\\theta - \\phi} + e^{-\\theta - \\phi} \\).\n\nSecond term numerator: \\( (e^{\\theta} - e^{-\\theta})(e^{\\phi} - e^{-\\phi}) = e^{\\theta + \\phi} - e^{-\\theta + \\phi} - e^{\\theta - \\phi} + e^{-\\theta - \\phi} \\).\n\nSo, putting them together:\n\nFirst term: \\( 5/4 [ e^{\\theta + \\phi} + e^{-\\theta + \\phi} + e^{\\theta - \\phi} + e^{-\\theta - \\phi} ] \\).\n\nSecond term: \\( 6/4 [ e^{\\theta + \\phi} - e^{-\\theta + \\phi} - e^{\\theta - \\phi} + e^{-\\theta - \\phi} ] \\).\n\nAdding them together:\n\nTotal expression:\n\n\\( (5/4 + 6/4) e^{\\theta + \\phi} + (5/4 - 6/4) e^{-\\theta + \\phi} + (5/4 - 6/4) e^{\\theta - \\phi} + (5/4 + 6/4) e^{-\\theta - \\phi} = 0 \\).\n\nSimplify coefficients:\n\n5/4 +6/4 = 11/4,\n\n5/4 -6/4 = -1/4,\n\nSo,\n\n\\( (11/4) e^{\\theta + \\phi} - (1/4) e^{-\\theta + \\phi} - (1/4) e^{\\theta - \\phi} + (11/4) e^{-\\theta - \\phi} = 0 \\).\n\nLet me factor out 1/4:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{4} [ 11 e^{\\theta + \\phi} - e^{-\\theta + \\phi} - e^{\\theta - \\phi} + 11 e^{-\\theta - \\phi} ] = 0 \\).\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n\\( 11 e^{\\theta + \\phi} - e^{-\\theta + \\phi} - e^{\\theta - \\phi} + 11 e^{-\\theta - \\phi} = 0 \\).\n\nLet me factor terms:\n\nGroup terms with \\( e^{\\theta + \\phi} \\) and \\( e^{-\\theta - \\phi} \\), and terms with \\( e^{-\\theta + \\phi} \\) and \\( e^{\\theta - \\phi} \\):\n\n= \\( 11 e^{\\theta + \\phi} + 11 e^{-\\theta - \\phi} - e^{-\\theta + \\phi} - e^{\\theta - \\phi} = 0 \\).\n\nFactor:\n\n= \\( 11 (e^{\\theta + \\phi} + e^{-\\theta - \\phi}) - (e^{-\\theta + \\phi} + e^{\\theta - \\phi}) = 0 \\).\n\nRecognize that \\( e^{a} + e^{-a} = 2 \\cosh a \\).\n\nSo,\n\n= \\( 11 \\times 2 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) - [ e^{-\\theta + \\phi} + e^{\\theta - \\phi} ] = 0 \\).\n\nWait, the second term is \\( e^{-\\theta + \\phi} + e^{\\theta - \\phi} = e^{\\phi - \\theta} + e^{\\theta - \\phi} = 2 \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) \\).\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n= \\( 22 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) - 2 \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) = 0 \\).\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\( 11 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) - \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) = 0 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( 11 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) = \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) \\).\n\nHmm, interesting equation. Let me denote \\( \\alpha = \\theta + \\phi \\) and \\( \\beta = \\theta - \\phi \\). Then, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( 11 \\cosh \\alpha = \\cosh \\beta \\).\n\nBut \\( \\alpha = \\theta + \\phi \\), \\( \\beta = \\theta - \\phi \\).\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\( 11 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) = \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) \\).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n\\( \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) = 11 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) \\).\n\nHmm, hyperbolic cosine is always greater than or equal to 1, so 11 times a hyperbolic cosine is quite large. So, \\( \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) \\) must be equal to 11 times \\( \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) \\).\n\nLet me think about the relationship between \\( \\theta \\) and \\( \\phi \\). Maybe I can express \\( \\theta \\) in terms of \\( \\phi \\), or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write \\( \\theta = \\phi + \\gamma \\), but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps express \\( \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) = 11 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( u = \\theta + \\phi \\), \\( v = \\theta - \\phi \\).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n\\( \\cosh v = 11 \\cosh u \\).\n\nBut we also have \\( u = \\theta + \\phi \\), \\( v = \\theta - \\phi \\).\n\nSo, we can write \\( \\theta = \\frac{u + v}{2} \\), \\( \\phi = \\frac{u - v}{2} \\).\n\nBut not sure if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps we can write in terms of exponentials.\n\nWe have \\( \\cosh v = 11 \\cosh u \\).\n\nExpressed in exponentials:\n\n\\( \\frac{e^v + e^{-v}}{2} = 11 \\times \\frac{e^u + e^{-u}}{2} \\).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n\\( e^v + e^{-v} = 11 (e^u + e^{-u}) \\).\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n\\( e^v + e^{-v} - 11 e^u - 11 e^{-u} = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe we can find a relationship between u and v.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express \\( \\cosh v = 11 \\cosh u \\) and use the identity \\( \\cosh^2 v - \\sinh^2 v = 1 \\).\n\nWait, but I don't know if that directly helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that \\( \\cosh v = 11 \\cosh u \\), so \\( \\cosh v = 11 \\cosh u \\), which implies that \\( v = \\cosh^{-1}(11 \\cosh u) \\).\n\nBut hyperbolic inverse functions can be expressed in terms of logarithms:\n\n\\( \\cosh^{-1} x = \\ln(x + \\sqrt{x^2 - 1}) \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( v = \\ln(11 \\cosh u + \\sqrt{(11 \\cosh u)^2 - 1}) \\).\n\nHmm, but this seems too involved. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nWait, perhaps using the definitions of cosh:\n\n\\( \\cosh v = 11 \\cosh u \\) implies \\( \\frac{e^v + e^{-v}}{2} = 11 \\times \\frac{e^u + e^{-u}}{2} \\).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n\\( e^v + e^{-v} = 11 e^u + 11 e^{-u} \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( a = e^u \\), \\( b = e^v \\). Then,\n\n\\( b + 1/b = 11 (a + 1/a) \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( b + 1/b = 11 a + 11 / a \\).\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( ab \\):\n\n\\( b^2 a + a = 11 a^2 b + 11 b \\).\n\nWait, maybe rearrange terms:\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\( b^2 a + a - 11 a^2 b - 11 b = 0 \\).\n\nFactor terms:\n\nHmm, factor by grouping:\n\nGroup terms with \\( a \\) and terms with \\( b \\):\n\n= \\( a(b^2 + 1) - b(11 a^2 + 11) = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe factor out 11:\n\n= \\( a(b^2 + 1) - 11 b(a^2 + 1) = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, perhaps not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express \\( a \\) in terms of \\( b \\) or vice versa.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n\\( a(b^2 + 1) = 11 b(a^2 + 1) \\).\n\nDivide both sides by \\( b(a^2 + 1) \\):\n\n\\( \\frac{a(b^2 + 1)}{b(a^2 + 1)} = 11 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( \\frac{a}{b} \\times \\frac{b^2 + 1}{a^2 + 1} = 11 \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( k = \\frac{a}{b} \\). Then,\n\n\\( k \\times \\frac{b^2 + 1}{a^2 + 1} = 11 \\).\n\nBut \\( a = k b \\), so substitute:\n\n\\( k \\times \\frac{b^2 + 1}{(k^2 b^2) + 1} = 11 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( k \\times \\frac{b^2 + 1}{k^2 b^2 + 1} = 11 \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( t = b^2 \\). Then,\n\n\\( k \\times \\frac{t + 1}{k^2 t + 1} = 11 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( \\frac{k(t + 1)}{k^2 t + 1} = 11 \\).\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n\\( k(t + 1) = 11(k^2 t + 1) \\).\n\nExpand:\n\n\\( kt + k = 11 k^2 t + 11 \\).\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\( kt + k - 11 k^2 t - 11 = 0 \\).\n\nFactor terms with \\( t \\):\n\n\\( t(k - 11 k^2) + (k - 11) = 0 \\).\n\nFactor:\n\n\\( t k (1 - 11 k) + (k - 11) = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can solve for \\( t \\):\n\n\\( t = \\frac{11 - k}{k(1 - 11k)} \\).\n\nWait, but \\( t = b^2 \\) must be positive, as it's the square of \\( e^v \\), which is positive. So, the numerator and denominator must have the same sign.\n\nLet me write:\n\n\\( t = \\frac{11 - k}{k(1 - 11k)} \\).\n\nSo, the denominator is \\( k(1 - 11k) \\), numerator is \\( 11 - k \\).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n\\( t = \\frac{11 - k}{k(1 - 11k)} = \\frac{-(k - 11)}{k(1 - 11k)} = \\frac{-(k - 11)}{k(1 - 11k)} \\).\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n\\( 1 - 11k = -(11k - 1) \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( t = \\frac{-(k - 11)}{k (- (11k - 1))} = \\frac{-(k - 11)}{ -k(11k - 1)} = \\frac{(k - 11)}{k(11k - 1)} \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( t = \\frac{k - 11}{k(11k - 1)} \\).\n\nSince \\( t = b^2 > 0 \\), the numerator and denominator must have the same sign.\n\nSo,\n\nCase 1: Both numerator and denominator are positive.\n\nSo,\n\n\\( k - 11 > 0 \\) => \\( k > 11 \\),\n\nand\n\n\\( k(11k - 1) > 0 \\).\n\nSince \\( k > 11 \\), \\( 11k - 1 > 0 \\) because \\( 11*11 -1 = 121 -1 = 120 >0 \\). So, denominator is positive. So, this case is possible.\n\nCase 2: Both numerator and denominator are negative.\n\nSo,\n\n\\( k - 11 < 0 \\) => \\( k < 11 \\),\n\nand\n\n\\( k(11k - 1) < 0 \\).\n\nSo, \\( k < 11 \\) and \\( k(11k -1) < 0 \\).\n\nLet me solve \\( k(11k - 1) < 0 \\).\n\nThis inequality holds when \\( k \\) and \\( 11k -1 \\) have opposite signs.\n\nSo, either:\n\n1. \\( k > 0 \\) and \\( 11k -1 < 0 \\) => \\( 0 < k < 1/11 \\).\n\nOr,\n\n2. \\( k < 0 \\) and \\( 11k -1 > 0 \\) => \\( k > 1/11 \\) and \\( k <0 \\), which is impossible.\n\nSo, only the first case applies: \\( 0 < k < 1/11 \\).\n\nBut in this case, since \\( k = a / b = (e^u)/(e^v) = e^{u - v} \\).\n\nSince \\( u = \\theta + \\phi \\), \\( v = \\theta - \\phi \\), so \\( u - v = 2 \\phi \\).\n\nSo, \\( k = e^{2 \\phi} \\).\n\nSo, \\( k > 0 \\), which is fine.\n\nSo, in Case 2, \\( 0 < k < 1/11 \\).\n\nSo, in total, the solutions are \\( k > 11 \\) or \\( 0 < k < 1/11 \\).\n\nBut \\( k = e^{2 \\phi} \\), which is always positive. So, the acceptable ranges for \\( k \\) are \\( k > 11 \\) or \\( 0 < k < 1/11 \\).\n\nSo, for each case, we can express \\( t \\) in terms of \\( k \\).\n\nSo, \\( t = \\frac{k - 11}{k(11k -1)} \\).\n\nBut \\( t = b^2 = e^{2v} \\), which must be positive. So, as long as numerator and denominator have the same sign, which is already handled by the cases.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a relationship between \\( u \\) and \\( v \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a ratio between \\( \\theta \\) and \\( \\phi \\). Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of this equation \\( 11 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) = \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) \\) as a condition on \\( \\theta \\) and \\( \\phi \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( \\alpha = \\theta + \\phi \\), \\( \\beta = \\theta - \\phi \\).\n\nThen, equation is \\( 11 \\cosh \\alpha = \\cosh \\beta \\).\n\nAlso, since \\( \\alpha = \\theta + \\phi \\), \\( \\beta = \\theta - \\phi \\), we can solve for \\( \\theta \\) and \\( \\phi \\):\n\n\\( \\theta = (\\alpha + \\beta)/2 \\),\n\n\\( \\phi = (\\alpha - \\beta)/2 \\).\n\nBut I don't know if this substitution helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express \\( \\cosh \\beta = 11 \\cosh \\alpha \\), and then use the identity \\( \\cosh^2 \\beta - \\sinh^2 \\beta = 1 \\).\n\nBut since \\( \\cosh \\beta = 11 \\cosh \\alpha \\), we can write \\( \\sinh \\beta = \\sqrt{\\cosh^2 \\beta -1} = \\sqrt{(11 \\cosh \\alpha)^2 -1} \\).\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express \\( \\cosh \\beta = 11 \\cosh \\alpha \\) as \\( \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) = 11 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) \\), and then use the formula for \\( \\cosh(A - B) \\) and \\( \\cosh(A + B) \\).\n\nRecall that:\n\n\\( \\cosh(A - B) = \\cosh A \\cosh B - \\sinh A \\sinh B \\),\n\n\\( \\cosh(A + B) = \\cosh A \\cosh B + \\sinh A \\sinh B \\).\n\nSo, substituting,\n\n\\( \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) = 11 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) \\),\n\nbecomes,\n\n\\( \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi - \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi = 11 (\\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi + \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi) \\).\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n\\( \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi - \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi - 11 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi - 11 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi = 0 \\).\n\nFactor terms:\n\n\\( (\\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi - 11 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi) + (- \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi - 11 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi) = 0 \\).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( (-10 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi) + (-12 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi) = 0 \\).\n\nFactor out -2:\n\n\\( -2(5 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi + 6 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi) = 0 \\).\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\n\\( 5 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi + 6 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi = 0 \\).\n\nWait a minute, this is the same as equation (1) we had earlier when we substituted the parametrization. So, that brings us back to the same point.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is going in circles. Maybe I should try another strategy.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of parametrizing with hyperbola functions, perhaps use coordinates and vectors.\n\nSince the rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, and the diagonals are perpendicular, the rhombus is actually a kite as well, but since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal.\n\nBut another thought: The rhombus can be considered as a parallelogram with equal sides and perpendicular diagonals.\n\nWait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are always perpendicular. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other at the origin, the four points can be considered as \\( A = (a, b) \\), \\( C = (-a, -b) \\), \\( B = (c, d) \\), \\( D = (-c, -d) \\).\n\nSince \\( ABCD \\) is a rhombus, all sides are equal, so the distance between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) must equal the distance between \\( B \\) and \\( C \\).\n\nWait, let me compute \\( AB^2 \\) and \\( BC^2 \\).\n\n\\( AB^2 = (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 \\).\n\n\\( BC^2 = (-a - c)^2 + (-b - d)^2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2 \\).\n\nSet them equal:\n\n\\( (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2 \\).\n\nExpand both sides:\n\nLeft: \\( c\u00b2 - 2ac + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - 2bd + b\u00b2 \\).\n\nRight: \\( a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2 \\).\n\nSubtract left from right:\n\n\\( (a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 - 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2bd + d\u00b2) \\) = \\( 4ac + 4bd = 0 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( 4ac + 4bd = 0 \\) => \\( ac + bd = 0 \\). --- (A)\n\nWhich is the same as equation (1) we had earlier.\n\nSo, this gives a condition on \\( a, b, c, d \\).\n\nAdditionally, since \\( A = (a, b) \\) and \\( B = (c, d) \\) lie on the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\), we have:\n\nFor \\( A \\): \\( \\frac{a\u00b2}{20} - \\frac{b\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\) --- (B)\n\nFor \\( B \\): \\( \\frac{c\u00b2}{20} - \\frac{d\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\) --- (C)\n\nSo, we have three equations: (A), (B), and (C).\n\nOur goal is to find \\( BD^2 \\). The diagonal \\( BD \\) goes from \\( B = (c, d) \\) to \\( D = (-c, -d) \\). So, the length of \\( BD \\) is the distance between \\( (c, d) \\) and \\( (-c, -d) \\).\n\nCompute \\( BD^2 \\):\n\n\\( (-c - c)^2 + (-d - d)^2 = (-2c)^2 + (-2d)^2 = 4c\u00b2 + 4d\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) \\).\n\nSo, \\( BD^2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) \\).\n\nWe need to find the infimum of \\( BD^2 \\) over all such rhombi.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimal possible value of \\( 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) \\) given the constraints (A), (B), and (C).\n\nSo, our problem reduces to minimizing \\( c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 \\) subject to:\n\n1. \\( ac + bd = 0 \\) --- (A)\n\n2. \\( \\frac{a\u00b2}{20} - \\frac{b\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\) --- (B)\n\n3. \\( \\frac{c\u00b2}{20} - \\frac{d\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\) --- (C)\n\nSo, variables are \\( a, b, c, d \\), subject to these constraints.\n\nWe can perhaps express \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in terms of \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) using equation (A), then substitute into equation (B) to get a relation between \\( c \\) and \\( d \\), then use equation (C) to find a condition.\n\nFrom equation (A): \\( ac + bd = 0 \\).\n\nWe can write this as \\( a c = - b d \\).\n\nSo, \\( a = (-b d)/c \\), assuming \\( c \\neq 0 \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( b = (-a c)/d \\), assuming \\( d \\neq 0 \\).\n\nBut perhaps it's better to express \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in terms of \\( c \\) and \\( d \\), then substitute into equation (B).\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFrom equation (A): \\( a c = - b d \\).\n\nLet me solve for \\( a \\):\n\n\\( a = (-b d)/c \\).\n\nSubstitute into equation (B):\n\n\\( \\frac{a\u00b2}{20} - \\frac{b\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( \\frac{ ( (-b d / c )^2 ) }{20} - \\frac{b\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( \\frac{ b\u00b2 d\u00b2 }{20 c\u00b2 } - \\frac{b\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nFactor \\( b\u00b2 \\):\n\n\\( b\u00b2 \\left( \\frac{d\u00b2}{20 c\u00b2} - \\frac{1}{24} \\right) = 1 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( b\u00b2 = \\frac{1}{ \\left( \\frac{d\u00b2}{20 c\u00b2} - \\frac{1}{24} \\right) } \\).\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe instead, we can parametrize \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) using hyperbola parametrization, similar to earlier.\n\nLet me set \\( c = \\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\phi \\), \\( d = \\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\phi \\).\n\nSimilarly, from equation (A): \\( a c + b d = 0 \\).\n\nSo, \\( a \\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\phi + b \\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\phi = 0 \\).\n\nLet me solve for \\( a \\):\n\n\\( a = - \\frac{ b \\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\phi }{ \\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\phi } = - b \\sqrt{ \\frac{24}{20} } \\tanh \\phi = - b \\sqrt{ \\frac{6}{5} } \\tanh \\phi \\).\n\nSo, \\( a = - b \\sqrt{6/5} \\tanh \\phi \\).\n\nNow, substitute \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) into equation (B):\n\n\\( \\frac{a\u00b2}{20} - \\frac{b\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nSubstitute \\( a = - b \\sqrt{6/5} \\tanh \\phi \\):\n\n\\( \\frac{ (b\u00b2 (6/5) \\tanh\u00b2 \\phi ) }{20} - \\frac{b\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( \\frac{6 b\u00b2 \\tanh\u00b2 \\phi }{100} - \\frac{b\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\n\\( \\frac{3 b\u00b2 \\tanh\u00b2 \\phi }{50} - \\frac{b\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nFactor \\( b\u00b2 \\):\n\n\\( b\u00b2 \\left( \\frac{3 \\tanh\u00b2 \\phi }{50} - \\frac{1}{24} \\right) = 1 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( b\u00b2 = \\frac{1}{ \\left( \\frac{3 \\tanh\u00b2 \\phi }{50} - \\frac{1}{24} \\right) } \\).\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit involved, but perhaps we can express everything in terms of \\( \\phi \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( t = \\tanh \\phi \\). Then, \\( \\tanh \\phi = t \\), so \\( \\phi = \\tanh^{-1} t \\), and \\( \\text{sech}^2 \\phi = 1 - t\u00b2 \\).\n\nBut perhaps it's better to express \\( \\tanh \\phi \\) as \\( t \\), so \\( \\tanh \\phi = t \\), which implies \\( \\phi = \\text{arctanh}(t) \\), and \\( \\text{csch}^2 \\phi = 1 / (1 - t\u00b2) \\), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express \\( \\tanh \\phi \\) in terms of \\( \\sinh \\phi \\) and \\( \\cosh \\phi \\), but that might not help.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write \\( \\tanh \\phi = \\sinh \\phi / \\cosh \\phi \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\tanh \\phi = \\sqrt{ \\frac{24}{20} } \\times \\frac{d}{c} \\).\n\nWait, because \\( c = \\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\phi \\), \\( d = \\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\phi \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\tanh \\phi = \\frac{d}{c} \\times \\sqrt{24/20} \\).\n\nWait, let me compute \\( \\tanh \\phi \\):\n\n\\( \\tanh \\phi = \\frac{\\sinh \\phi}{\\cosh \\phi} = \\frac{d / \\sqrt{24}}{c / \\sqrt{20}} = \\frac{d \\sqrt{20}}{c \\sqrt{24}} = \\frac{d}{c} \\sqrt{20/24} = \\frac{d}{c} \\sqrt{5/6} \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\tanh \\phi = \\frac{d}{c} \\sqrt{5/6} \\).\n\nSo, substituting back into the equation for \\( b\u00b2 \\):\n\n\\( b\u00b2 = \\frac{1}{ \\left( \\frac{3 (d/c)^2 (5/6) }{50} - \\frac{1}{24} \\right) } \\).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( b\u00b2 = \\frac{1}{ \\left( \\frac{15 (d/c)^2 }{300} - \\frac{1}{24} \\right) } = \\frac{1}{ \\left( \\frac{(d/c)^2 }{20} - \\frac{1}{24} \\right) } \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( b\u00b2 = \\frac{1}{ \\left( \\frac{(d/c)^2 }{20} - \\frac{1}{24} \\right) } \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( k = d/c \\). So, \\( k = d/c \\).\n\nThen,\n\n\\( b\u00b2 = \\frac{1}{ (k\u00b2 / 20 - 1/24 ) } \\).\n\nSo, \\( b\u00b2 = \\frac{1}{ ( (6 k\u00b2 - 5 ) / 120 ) } = 120 / (6 k\u00b2 - 5) \\).\n\nSo, \\( b = \\sqrt{120 / (6k\u00b2 -5)} \\).\n\nBut \\( k = d/c \\), and from equation (C):\n\n\\( \\frac{c\u00b2}{20} - \\frac{d\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nSubstitute \\( d = k c \\):\n\n\\( \\frac{c\u00b2}{20} - \\frac{k\u00b2 c\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nFactor \\( c\u00b2 \\):\n\n\\( c\u00b2 \\left( \\frac{1}{20} - \\frac{k\u00b2}{24} \\right) = 1 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( c\u00b2 = \\frac{1}{ (1/20 - k\u00b2 /24 ) } = \\frac{1}{ ( (6 - 5 k\u00b2 ) / 120 ) } = 120 / (6 - 5 k\u00b2 ) \\).\n\nThus,\n\n\\( c = \\sqrt{ 120 / (6 - 5 k\u00b2 ) } \\).\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\\( d = k c = k \\sqrt{ 120 / (6 - 5 k\u00b2 ) } \\).\n\nSo, now, we have expressions for \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) in terms of \\( k \\).\n\nSimilarly, from equation (A):\n\n\\( a = - b \\sqrt{6/5} \\tanh \\phi \\).\n\nBut earlier, we had \\( \\tanh \\phi = \\frac{d}{c} \\sqrt{5/6} = k \\sqrt{5/6} \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( a = - b \\sqrt{6/5} \\times (k \\sqrt{5/6}) ) = - b k \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( a = - b k \\).\n\nAnd from equation (B):\n\n\\( b\u00b2 = 120 / (6k\u00b2 -5) \\).\n\nSo, \\( b = \\sqrt{120/(6k\u00b2 -5)} \\).\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\( a = -k \\sqrt{120/(6k\u00b2 -5)} \\).\n\nSo, now, we have expressions for \\( a, b, c, d \\) in terms of \\( k \\).\n\nNow, our goal is to compute \\( BD^2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) \\).\n\nWe have \\( c\u00b2 = 120/(6 -5k\u00b2) \\) and \\( d\u00b2 = k\u00b2 c\u00b2 = 120 k\u00b2/(6 -5k\u00b2) \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 = 120/(6 -5k\u00b2) + 120 k\u00b2/(6 -5k\u00b2) = 120(1 + k\u00b2)/(6 -5k\u00b2) \\).\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\( BD^2 = 4 * 120 (1 + k\u00b2)/(6 -5k\u00b2) = 480 (1 + k\u00b2)/(6 -5k\u00b2) \\).\n\nSo, \\( BD^2 \\) is expressed in terms of \\( k \\) as \\( 480 (1 + k\u00b2)/(6 -5k\u00b2) \\).\n\nOur goal is to find the infimum of \\( BD^2 \\), i.e., the minimal value of \\( 480 (1 + k\u00b2)/(6 -5k\u00b2) \\).\n\nBut we have constraints on \\( k \\).\n\nLooking back, from \\( c\u00b2 = 120/(6 -5k\u00b2) \\), the denominator \\( 6 -5k\u00b2 \\) must be positive, because \\( c\u00b2 > 0 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( 6 -5k\u00b2 > 0 \\) => \\( k\u00b2 < 6/5 \\) => \\( |k| < \\sqrt{6/5} \\approx 1.095 \\).\n\nAlso, from equation \\( b\u00b2 = 120/(6k\u00b2 -5) \\), the denominator \\( 6k\u00b2 -5 \\) must be positive, because \\( b\u00b2 > 0 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( 6k\u00b2 -5 > 0 \\) => \\( k\u00b2 > 5/6 \\) => \\( |k| > \\sqrt{5/6} \\approx 0.9129 \\).\n\nSo, \\( k \\) must satisfy \\( \\sqrt{5/6} < |k| < \\sqrt{6/5} \\).\n\nSo, \\( k \\) lies in \\( (\\sqrt{5/6}, \\sqrt{6/5}) \\) or \\( (-\\sqrt{6/5}, -\\sqrt{5/6}) \\). But since \\( k = d/c \\), and \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) can be positive or negative, but \\( k\u00b2 \\) is positive regardless. So, we can consider \\( k > 0 \\) without loss of generality, as the expression for \\( BD^2 \\) is even in \\( k \\).\n\nSo, we can assume \\( k > 0 \\), so \\( \\sqrt{5/6} < k < \\sqrt{6/5} \\).\n\nSo, now, our problem reduces to minimizing the function \\( f(k) = 480 (1 + k\u00b2)/(6 -5k\u00b2) \\) for \\( k \\in (\\sqrt{5/6}, \\sqrt{6/5}) \\).\n\nTo find the minimal value of \\( f(k) \\), we can take the derivative of \\( f(k) \\) with respect to \\( k \\), set it to zero, and solve for \\( k \\).\n\nLet me compute \\( f(k) = 480 (1 + k\u00b2)/(6 -5k\u00b2) \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( f(k) = 480 \\times \\frac{1 + k\u00b2}{6 -5k\u00b2} \\).\n\nLet me compute the derivative \\( f'(k) \\).\n\nUsing the quotient rule:\n\nIf \\( f(k) = \\frac{N}{D} \\), where \\( N = 1 + k\u00b2 \\), \\( D = 6 -5k\u00b2 \\),\n\nthen,\n\n\\( f'(k) = \\frac{N' D - N D'}{D^2} \\).\n\nCompute N' = 2k,\n\nD' = -10k.\n\nSo,\n\n\\( f'(k) = \\frac{2k (6 -5k\u00b2) - (1 + k\u00b2)(-10k)}{(6 -5k\u00b2)^2} \\).\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nFirst term: \\( 2k (6 -5k\u00b2) = 12k -10k\u00b3 \\).\n\nSecond term: \\( - (1 + k\u00b2)(-10k) = 10k + 10k\u00b3 \\).\n\nSo, numerator:\n\n\\( (12k -10k\u00b3) + (10k +10k\u00b3) = 22k \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( f'(k) = \\frac{22k}{(6 -5k\u00b2)^2} \\).\n\nSet derivative equal to zero:\n\n\\( 22k = 0 \\) => \\( k = 0 \\).\n\nBut \\( k \\) is in \\( (\\sqrt{5/6}, \\sqrt{6/5}) \\), which is approximately (0.9129, 1.0954). So, \\( k = 0 \\) is not in the domain.\n\nTherefore, the derivative does not equal zero within the domain. So, the function \\( f(k) \\) has no critical points in the domain \\( (\\sqrt{5/6}, \\sqrt{6/5}) \\).\n\nTherefore, the extrema must occur at the endpoints of the interval.\n\nSo, we can evaluate \\( f(k) \\) as \\( k \\) approaches \\( \\sqrt{5/6} \\) from above and as \\( k \\) approaches \\( \\sqrt{6/5} \\) from below.\n\nCompute the limits:\n\nFirst, as \\( k \\to \\sqrt{5/6}^+ \\):\n\nCompute \\( f(k) = 480 \\times \\frac{1 + k\u00b2}{6 -5k\u00b2} \\).\n\nAt \\( k = \\sqrt{5/6} \\):\n\n\\( k\u00b2 = 5/6 \\).\n\nSo,\n\nNumerator: \\( 1 + 5/6 = 11/6 \\).\n\nDenominator: \\( 6 -5*(5/6) = 6 -25/6 = (36 -25)/6 = 11/6 \\).\n\nThus,\n\n\\( f(k) = 480 * (11/6)/(11/6) = 480 * 1 = 480 \\).\n\nSimilarly, as \\( k \\to \\sqrt{6/5}^- \\):\n\nCompute \\( f(k) \\).\n\nAt \\( k = \\sqrt{6/5} \\):\n\n\\( k\u00b2 = 6/5 \\).\n\nSo,\n\nNumerator: \\( 1 + 6/5 = 11/5 \\).\n\nDenominator: \\( 6 -5*(6/5) = 6 -6 = 0 \\).\n\nSo, as \\( k \\to \\sqrt{6/5}^- \\), denominator approaches 0 from positive side, numerator approaches 11/5, so \\( f(k) \\) approaches infinity.\n\nThus, the minimal value of \\( f(k) \\) is 480, achieved as \\( k \\) approaches \\( \\sqrt{5/6} \\) from above.\n\nBut wait, we must check if this is indeed attainable.\n\nBecause when \\( k = \\sqrt{5/6} \\), the denominator in \\( c\u00b2 = 120/(6 -5k\u00b2) \\) becomes zero, which would make \\( c\u00b2 \\) undefined. So, \\( k \\) cannot be exactly \\( \\sqrt{5/6} \\), only approaching it from above. Therefore, \\( f(k) \\) approaches 480 but doesn't actually reach it.\n\nThus, the infimum of \\( BD^2 \\) is 480, but it's never actually achieved; it's the greatest lower bound.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, when \\( k \\) approaches \\( \\sqrt{5/6} \\) from above, \\( f(k) \\) approaches 480, and as \\( k \\) approaches \\( \\sqrt{6/5} \\) from below, \\( f(k) \\) approaches infinity.\n\nSo, the minimal possible value of \\( BD^2 \\) is 480, but it's not attainable since \\( k \\) cannot be exactly \\( \\sqrt{5/6} \\). So, the infimum is 480.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombi. Since \\( BD^2 \\) can be made arbitrarily close to 480 but never less than 480, the greatest real number less than all \\( BD^2 \\) is 480.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if the infimum is 480, then for any \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), there exists a rhombus with \\( BD^2 < 480 + \\epsilon \\). But the problem is asking for the greatest real number \\( m \\) such that \\( m < BD^2 \\) for all rhombi. Since \\( BD^2 \\) can get arbitrarily close to 480, the greatest such \\( m \\) would be 480, because for any \\( m < 480 \\), there exists a rhombus with \\( BD^2 \\) less than \\( m \\). Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, actually, the infimum is 480, which is the greatest lower bound. So, for any \\( m < 480 \\), there exists a rhombus with \\( BD^2 \\) less than \\( m \\). But the problem is asking for the greatest \\( m \\) such that \\( m < BD^2 \\) for all rhombi. Since \\( BD^2 \\) can be as small as just above 480, the greatest such \\( m \\) is 480, because 480 is less than or equal to all \\( BD^2 \\), but since \\( BD^2 \\) can be made arbitrarily close to 480, 480 is the infimum.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think about it.\n\nIf the infimum is 480, then 480 is the smallest value that \\( BD^2 \\) can approach but not necessarily reach. So, for any \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), there exists a rhombus with \\( BD^2 < 480 + \\epsilon \\). But the problem asks for the greatest real number \\( m \\) such that \\( m < BD^2 \\) for all rhombi.\n\nSo, \\( m \\) must be less than every possible \\( BD^2 \\). Since \\( BD^2 \\) can be made as close to 480 as desired, \\( m \\) cannot be greater than 480. Because if \\( m \\) were greater than 480, say 481, then there exists a rhombus with \\( BD^2 = 480.5 \\), which is less than 481, contradicting \\( m < BD^2 \\) for all rhombi.\n\nTherefore, the greatest such \\( m \\) is 480. So, the answer is \\( \\boxed{480} \\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, in our calculation, as \\( k \\) approaches \\( \\sqrt{5/6} \\) from above, \\( BD^2 \\) approaches 480. So, for any \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), there exists a rhombus with \\( BD^2 \\) in \\( (480, 480 + \\epsilon) \\). So, the infimum is 480, and for any \\( m < 480 \\), there exists a rhombus with \\( BD^2 < m \\), which would mean that the greatest \\( m \\) satisfying \\( m < BD^2 \\) for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, no, if \\( m \\) is less than all \\( BD^2 \\), then \\( m \\) must be less than the infimum of \\( BD^2 \\), which is 480. But 480 is the infimum, so there are rhombi with \\( BD^2 \\) approaching 480. So, the greatest \\( m \\) that is less than all \\( BD^2 \\) is 480 because any \\( m \\) greater than 480 would not satisfy \\( m < BD^2 \\) for all rhombi, since some rhombi have \\( BD^2 \\) just above 480. Therefore, 480 is the greatest lower bound, so the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but hold on, in our earlier calculation, \\( BD^2 \\) approaches 480 from above as \\( k \\) approaches \\( \\sqrt{5/6} \\) from above. So, \\( BD^2 \\) can be made arbitrarily close to 480 but is always greater than 480. Therefore, the infimum is 480, but \\( BD^2 \\) is always greater than 480. So, the greatest real number less than all \\( BD^2 \\) is 480, because for any \\( m > 480 \\), there exists a rhombus with \\( BD^2 \\) less than \\( m \\), but 480 itself is the lower bound.\n\nWait, no, wait: If \\( BD^2 \\) can be as close to 480 as we want, but always greater than 480, then 480 is the infimum, and the greatest number less than all \\( BD^2 \\) would be 480, because any number less than 480 would not be less than all \\( BD^2 \\); for example, if \\( m = 480 \\), then \\( m < BD^2 \\) for all rhombi because \\( BD^2 \\) is always greater than 480. But if \\( m = 480 \\), it's not less than \\( BD^2 \\), it's equal to the infimum. Wait, no, actually, \\( BD^2 \\) is always greater than 480, so \\( 480 < BD^2 \\) for all rhombi. Therefore, the greatest real number \\( m \\) such that \\( m < BD^2 \\) for all rhombi is 480, because you can't have a larger \\( m \\) than 480 without violating the condition for some rhombus.\n\nWait, no, if \\( m = 480 \\), then \\( m \\) is not less than \\( BD^2 \\), because \\( BD^2 \\) approaches 480 but is always greater. So, \\( m \\) must be less than 480. But if you take \\( m = 480 \\), it's not less than \\( BD^2 \\); it's equal to the infimum. So, perhaps the greatest \\( m \\) is 480, but since \\( BD^2 \\) never actually reaches 480, the greatest \\( m \\) less than all \\( BD^2 \\) is 480. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: The infimum is 480, so the set of all \\( BD^2 \\) is \\( [480, \\infty) \\). Therefore, the greatest number less than all \\( BD^2 \\) is 480, because 480 is the smallest value in the set, and any number less than 480 would not be less than all \\( BD^2 \\) (since some \\( BD^2 \\) are exactly 480). Wait, no, in our case, the infimum is 480, but no \\( BD^2 \\) actually equals 480. So, the set is \\( (480, \\infty) \\). Therefore, the greatest number \\( m \\) such that \\( m < BD^2 \\) for all rhombi is 480, because for any \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), there exists a rhombus with \\( BD^2 < 480 + \\epsilon \\), but \\( BD^2 \\) is always greater than 480. So, 480 is the infimum, and the greatest lower bound.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\( \\boxed{480} \\).\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says:\n\nLet \\( A \\), \\( B \\), \\( C \\), and \\( D \\) be points on the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\) such that \\( ABCD \\) is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombi.\n\nHmm, okay. So, first, let's parse this. We have a hyperbola, and four points on it forming a rhombus. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. We need to find the greatest number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombi. So, essentially, we're looking for the infimum of \\( BD^2 \\) or something like that? Wait, no, the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all rhombi. So, maybe we need to find the minimum possible value of \\( BD^2 \\), and then the answer would be just below that? Or perhaps we need to find the supremum of the lower bounds of \\( BD^2 \\)?\n\nWait, no, the wording is a bit different. It says, \"the greatest real number that is less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of all numbers \\( m \\) such that \\( m < BD^2 \\) for every rhombus. So, \\( m \\) is the maximum lower bound for \\( BD^2 \\). So, essentially, it's the infimum of \\( BD^2 \\) across all such rhombi. Because if \\( m \\) is less than every \\( BD^2 \\), then the greatest such \\( m \\) is the infimum.\n\nSo, our goal is to find the infimum of \\( BD^2 \\) for all rhombi \\( ABCD \\) on the given hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin.\n\nAlright, let's get started.\n\nFirst, let's recall some properties of rhombuses. In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, actually, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.\n\nSo, in this case, the diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if \\( AC \\) and \\( BD \\) are the diagonals, then the midpoint of \\( AC \\) is the origin, and the midpoint of \\( BD \\) is also the origin.\n\nGiven that all four points lie on the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nSo, let's denote the points \\( A \\), \\( B \\), \\( C \\), and \\( D \\) as points on the hyperbola. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, we can think of the coordinates of the points as follows: If \\( A \\) is a point \\( (x, y) \\), then the point opposite to it across the origin would be \\( C = (-x, -y) \\). Similarly, if \\( B \\) is a point \\( (p, q) \\), then \\( D = (-p, -q) \\).\n\nSo, the four points are \\( A = (x, y) \\), \\( B = (p, q) \\), \\( C = (-x, -y) \\), \\( D = (-p, -q) \\).\n\nNow, since \\( ABCD \\) is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) must equal the distance between \\( B \\) and \\( C \\), and so on.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the properties of the rhombus. Since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, the vectors \\( \\vec{AC} \\) and \\( \\vec{BD} \\) must be perpendicular. So, their dot product is zero.\n\nBut wait, let's think in terms of coordinates. The vectors \\( AC \\) go from \\( A \\) to \\( C \\), which is \\( (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y) \\). Similarly, vector \\( BD \\) is \\( (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q) \\).\n\nWait, no, actually, the vectors of the diagonals are \\( AC \\) and \\( BD \\). So, \\( AC \\) is from \\( A \\) to \\( C \\), which is \\( (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y) \\). Similarly, \\( BD \\) is from \\( B \\) to \\( D \\), which is \\( (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q) \\).\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. So,\n\n\\( (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 4xp + 4yq = 0 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n\\( xp + yq = 0 \\)  --- (1)\n\nSo, equation (1) is a necessary condition for the diagonals to be perpendicular.\n\nAdditionally, since \\( ABCD \\) is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. Let's compute the lengths of sides \\( AB \\), \\( BC \\), etc., and set them equal.\n\nCompute \\( AB \\):\n\nPoint \\( A = (x, y) \\), Point \\( B = (p, q) \\).\n\nDistance squared: \\( (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 \\).\n\nCompute \\( BC \\):\n\nPoint \\( B = (p, q) \\), Point \\( C = (-x, -y) \\).\n\nDistance squared: \\( (-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2 \\).\n\nSimilarly, compute \\( CD \\):\n\nPoint \\( C = (-x, -y) \\), Point \\( D = (-p, -q) \\).\n\nDistance squared: \\( (-p + x)^2 + (-q + y)^2 \\).\n\nAnd \\( DA \\):\n\nPoint \\( D = (-p, -q) \\), Point \\( A = (x, y) \\).\n\nDistance squared: \\( (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2 \\).\n\nSince all sides are equal, set \\( AB^2 = BC^2 \\), \\( BC^2 = CD^2 \\), etc.\n\nLet me compute \\( AB^2 = (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 \\).\n\nCompute \\( BC^2 = (-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2 = (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2 \\).\n\nSet \\( AB^2 = BC^2 \\):\n\n\\( (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2 \\).\n\nExpand both sides:\n\nLeft: \\( p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2 \\).\n\nRight: \\( p\u00b2 + 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qy + y\u00b2 \\).\n\nSubtract left from right:\n\n\\( (p\u00b2 + 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qy + y\u00b2) - (p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2) \\) = \\( 4px + 4qy = 0 \\).\n\nSo, \\( 4px + 4qy = 0 \\) => \\( px + qy = 0 \\) --- (2).\n\nWait, equation (2) is similar to equation (1). Equation (1) was \\( xp + yq = 0 \\). So, equation (1) and equation (2) are the same. So, that doesn't give us new information.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should set another pair of sides equal. Let's set \\( AB^2 = AD^2 \\).\n\nWait, \\( AD \\) is from \\( A = (x, y) \\) to \\( D = (-p, -q) \\). So, distance squared is \\( (-p - x)^2 + (-q - y)^2 = (p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2 \\).\n\nWait, but \\( AB^2 = (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 \\), and \\( AD^2 = (p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2 \\). So, set them equal:\n\n\\( (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2 \\).\n\nWait, but that's the same as setting \\( AB^2 = BC^2 \\), which we already did, giving the same equation. So, perhaps all the equal side conditions lead to the same equation, so we might need another condition.\n\nWait, maybe instead of equating side lengths, I should think about vectors. Since it's a rhombus, the vectors \\( \\vec{AB} \\) and \\( \\vec{AD} \\) should have the same length and the angle between them should be such that the figure closes properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parameterize the points on the hyperbola.\n\nSince all four points lie on the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\), each point must satisfy this equation.\n\nSo, \\( A = (x, y) \\) satisfies \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( B = (p, q) \\) satisfies \\( \\frac{p^2}{20} - \\frac{q^2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nGiven that, and equation (1) \\( xp + yq = 0 \\), perhaps we can express one variable in terms of another.\n\nLet me think about how to parameterize points on a hyperbola. Hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions. For example, for the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \\), a parametrization is \\( x = a \\cosh \\theta \\), \\( y = b \\sinh \\theta \\). Alternatively, using rational parametrization, but hyperbolic functions might be more straightforward here.\n\nSo, let's set:\n\nFor point \\( A \\), let \\( x = \\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\theta \\), \\( y = \\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\theta \\).\n\nSimilarly, for point \\( B \\), let \\( p = \\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\phi \\), \\( q = \\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\phi \\).\n\nSince the hyperbola is symmetric, perhaps we can find a relationship between \\( \\theta \\) and \\( \\phi \\) based on equation (1): \\( xp + yq = 0 \\).\n\nSubstituting the parametrizations:\n\n\\( (\\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\theta)(\\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\phi) + (\\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\theta)(\\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\phi) = 0 \\).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 20 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi + 24 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi = 0 \\).\n\nLet me factor this:\n\n\\( 20 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi + 24 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, can I write this as a multiple of hyperbolic identities?\n\nRecall that \\( \\cosh(a + b) = \\cosh a \\cosh b + \\sinh a \\sinh b \\).\n\nSo, if we factor the equation, it's similar to:\n\n\\( 20 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) + (24 - 20) \\sinh a \\sinh b = 0 \\). Wait, no, that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, let's factor out common terms.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n\\( 20 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi + 24 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi = 0 \\).\n\nDivide both sides by, say, 4:\n\n\\( 5 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi + 6 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, this looks like a linear combination of hyperbolic functions. Maybe we can express this in terms of exponentials.\n\nRecall that \\( \\cosh t = \\frac{e^t + e^{-t}}{2} \\), \\( \\sinh t = \\frac{e^t - e^{-t}}{2} \\).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n\\( 5 \\left( \\frac{e^{\\theta} + e^{-\\theta}}{2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{e^{\\phi} + e^{-\\phi}}{2} \\right) + 6 \\left( \\frac{e^{\\theta} - e^{-\\theta}}{2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{e^{\\phi} - e^{-\\phi}}{2} \\right) = 0 \\).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: \\( 5 \\times \\frac{(e^{\\theta} + e^{-\\theta})(e^{\\phi} + e^{-\\phi})}{4} \\).\n\nSecond term: \\( 6 \\times \\frac{(e^{\\theta} - e^{-\\theta})(e^{\\phi} - e^{-\\phi})}{4} \\).\n\nSo, let's compute both:\n\nFirst term numerator: \\( (e^{\\theta} + e^{-\\theta})(e^{\\phi} + e^{-\\phi}) = e^{\\theta + \\phi} + e^{-\\theta + \\phi} + e^{\\theta - \\phi} + e^{-\\theta - \\phi} \\).\n\nSecond term numerator: \\( (e^{\\theta} - e^{-\\theta})(e^{\\phi} - e^{-\\phi}) = e^{\\theta + \\phi} - e^{-\\theta + \\phi} - e^{\\theta - \\phi} + e^{-\\theta - \\phi} \\).\n\nSo, putting them together:\n\nFirst term: \\( 5/4 [ e^{\\theta + \\phi} + e^{-\\theta + \\phi} + e^{\\theta - \\phi} + e^{-\\theta - \\phi} ] \\).\n\nSecond term: \\( 6/4 [ e^{\\theta + \\phi} - e^{-\\theta + \\phi} - e^{\\theta - \\phi} + e^{-\\theta - \\phi} ] \\).\n\nAdding them together:\n\nTotal expression:\n\n\\( (5/4 + 6/4) e^{\\theta + \\phi} + (5/4 - 6/4) e^{-\\theta + \\phi} + (5/4 - 6/4) e^{\\theta - \\phi} + (5/4 + 6/4) e^{-\\theta - \\phi} = 0 \\).\n\nSimplify coefficients:\n\n5/4 +6/4 = 11/4,\n\n5/4 -6/4 = -1/4,\n\nSo,\n\n\\( (11/4) e^{\\theta + \\phi} - (1/4) e^{-\\theta + \\phi} - (1/4) e^{\\theta - \\phi} + (11/4) e^{-\\theta - \\phi} = 0 \\).\n\nLet me factor out 1/4:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{4} [ 11 e^{\\theta + \\phi} - e^{-\\theta + \\phi} - e^{\\theta - \\phi} + 11 e^{-\\theta - \\phi} ] = 0 \\).\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n\\( 11 e^{\\theta + \\phi} - e^{-\\theta + \\phi} - e^{\\theta - \\phi} + 11 e^{-\\theta - \\phi} = 0 \\).\n\nLet me factor terms:\n\nGroup terms with \\( e^{\\theta + \\phi} \\) and \\( e^{-\\theta - \\phi} \\), and terms with \\( e^{-\\theta + \\phi} \\) and \\( e^{\\theta - \\phi} \\):\n\n= \\( 11 e^{\\theta + \\phi} + 11 e^{-\\theta - \\phi} - e^{-\\theta + \\phi} - e^{\\theta - \\phi} = 0 \\).\n\nFactor:\n\n= \\( 11 (e^{\\theta + \\phi} + e^{-\\theta - \\phi}) - (e^{-\\theta + \\phi} + e^{\\theta - \\phi}) = 0 \\).\n\nRecognize that \\( e^{a} + e^{-a} = 2 \\cosh a \\).\n\nSo,\n\n= \\( 11 \\times 2 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) - [ e^{-\\theta + \\phi} + e^{\\theta - \\phi} ] = 0 \\).\n\nWait, the second term is \\( e^{-\\theta + \\phi} + e^{\\theta - \\phi} = e^{\\phi - \\theta} + e^{\\theta - \\phi} = 2 \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) \\).\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n= \\( 22 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) - 2 \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) = 0 \\).\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\( 11 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) - \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) = 0 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( 11 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) = \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) \\).\n\nHmm, interesting equation. Let me denote \\( \\alpha = \\theta + \\phi \\) and \\( \\beta = \\theta - \\phi \\). Then, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( 11 \\cosh \\alpha = \\cosh \\beta \\).\n\nBut \\( \\alpha = \\theta + \\phi \\), \\( \\beta = \\theta - \\phi \\).\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\( 11 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) = \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) \\).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n\\( \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) = 11 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) \\).\n\nHmm, hyperbolic cosine is always greater than or equal to 1, so 11 times a hyperbolic cosine is quite large. So, \\( \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) \\) must be equal to 11 times \\( \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) \\).\n\nLet me think about the relationship between \\( \\theta \\) and \\( \\phi \\). Maybe I can express \\( \\theta \\) in terms of \\( \\phi \\), or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write \\( \\theta = \\phi + \\gamma \\), but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps express \\( \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) = 11 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( u = \\theta + \\phi \\), \\( v = \\theta - \\phi \\).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n\\( \\cosh v = 11 \\cosh u \\).\n\nBut we also have \\( u = \\theta + \\phi \\), \\( v = \\theta - \\phi \\).\n\nSo, we can write \\( \\theta = \\frac{u + v}{2} \\), \\( \\phi = \\frac{u - v}{2} \\).\n\nBut not sure if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps we can write in terms of exponentials.\n\nWe have \\( \\cosh v = 11 \\cosh u \\).\n\nExpressed in exponentials:\n\n\\( \\frac{e^v + e^{-v}}{2} = 11 \\times \\frac{e^u + e^{-u}}{2} \\).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n\\( e^v + e^{-v} = 11 (e^u + e^{-u}) \\).\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n\\( e^v + e^{-v} - 11 e^u - 11 e^{-u} = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe we can find a relationship between u and v.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express \\( \\cosh v = 11 \\cosh u \\) and use the identity \\( \\cosh^2 v - \\sinh^2 v = 1 \\).\n\nWait, but I don't know if that directly helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that \\( \\cosh v = 11 \\cosh u \\), so \\( \\cosh v = 11 \\cosh u \\), which implies that \\( v = \\cosh^{-1}(11 \\cosh u) \\).\n\nBut hyperbolic inverse functions can be expressed in terms of logarithms:\n\n\\( \\cosh^{-1} x = \\ln(x + \\sqrt{x^2 - 1}) \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( v = \\ln(11 \\cosh u + \\sqrt{(11 \\cosh u)^2 - 1}) \\).\n\nHmm, but this seems too involved. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nWait, perhaps using the definitions of cosh:\n\n\\( \\cosh v = 11 \\cosh u \\) implies \\( \\frac{e^v + e^{-v}}{2} = 11 \\times \\frac{e^u + e^{-u}}{2} \\).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n\\( e^v + e^{-v} = 11 e^u + 11 e^{-u} \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( a = e^u \\), \\( b = e^v \\). Then,\n\n\\( b + 1/b = 11 (a + 1/a) \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( b + 1/b = 11 a + 11 / a \\).\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( ab \\):\n\n\\( b^2 a + a = 11 a^2 b + 11 b \\).\n\nWait, maybe rearrange terms:\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\( b^2 a + a - 11 a^2 b - 11 b = 0 \\).\n\nFactor terms:\n\nHmm, factor by grouping:\n\nGroup terms with \\( a \\) and terms with \\( b \\):\n\n= \\( a(b^2 + 1) - b(11 a^2 + 11) = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe factor out 11:\n\n= \\( a(b^2 + 1) - 11 b(a^2 + 1) = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, perhaps not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express \\( a \\) in terms of \\( b \\) or vice versa.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n\\( a(b^2 + 1) = 11 b(a^2 + 1) \\).\n\nDivide both sides by \\( b(a^2 + 1) \\):\n\n\\( \\frac{a(b^2 + 1)}{b(a^2 + 1)} = 11 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( \\frac{a}{b} \\times \\frac{b^2 + 1}{a^2 + 1} = 11 \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( k = \\frac{a}{b} \\). Then,\n\n\\( k \\times \\frac{b^2 + 1}{a^2 + 1} = 11 \\).\n\nBut \\( a = k b \\), so substitute:\n\n\\( k \\times \\frac{b^2 + 1}{(k^2 b^2) + 1} = 11 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( k \\times \\frac{b^2 + 1}{k^2 b^2 + 1} = 11 \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( t = b^2 \\). Then,\n\n\\( k \\times \\frac{t + 1}{k^2 t + 1} = 11 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( \\frac{k(t + 1)}{k^2 t + 1} = 11 \\).\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n\\( k(t + 1) = 11(k^2 t + 1) \\).\n\nExpand:\n\n\\( kt + k = 11 k^2 t + 11 \\).\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\( kt + k - 11 k^2 t - 11 = 0 \\).\n\nFactor terms with \\( t \\):\n\n\\( t(k - 11 k^2) + (k - 11) = 0 \\).\n\nFactor:\n\n\\( t k (1 - 11 k) + (k - 11) = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can solve for \\( t \\):\n\n\\( t = \\frac{11 - k}{k(1 - 11k)} \\).\n\nWait, but \\( t = b^2 \\) must be positive, as it's the square of \\( e^v \\), which is positive. So, the numerator and denominator must have the same sign.\n\nLet me write:\n\n\\( t = \\frac{11 - k}{k(1 - 11k)} \\).\n\nSo, the denominator is \\( k(1 - 11k) \\), numerator is \\( 11 - k \\).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n\\( t = \\frac{11 - k}{k(1 - 11k)} = \\frac{-(k - 11)}{k(1 - 11k)} = \\frac{-(k - 11)}{k(1 - 11k)} \\).\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n\\( 1 - 11k = -(11k - 1) \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( t = \\frac{-(k - 11)}{k (- (11k - 1))} = \\frac{-(k - 11)}{ -k(11k - 1)} = \\frac{(k - 11)}{k(11k - 1)} \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( t = \\frac{k - 11}{k(11k - 1)} \\).\n\nSince \\( t = b^2 > 0 \\), the numerator and denominator must have the same sign.\n\nSo,\n\nCase 1: Both numerator and denominator are positive.\n\nSo,\n\n\\( k - 11 > 0 \\) => \\( k > 11 \\),\n\nand\n\n\\( k(11k - 1) > 0 \\).\n\nSince \\( k > 11 \\), \\( 11k - 1 > 0 \\) because \\( 11*11 -1 = 121 -1 = 120 >0 \\).

So, this case is possible.\n\nCase 2: Both numerator and denominator are negative.\n\nSo,\n\n\\( k - 11 < 0 \\) => \\( k < 11 \\),\n\nand\n\n\\( k(11k - 1) < 0 \\).\n\nSo, \\( k < 11 \\) and \\( k(11k -1) < 0 \\).\n\nLet me solve \\( k(11k - 1) < 0 \\).\n\nThis inequality holds when \\( k \\) and \\( 11k -1 \\) have opposite signs.\n\nSo, either:\n\n1. \\( k > 0 \\) and \\( 11k -1 < 0 \\) => \\( 0 < k < 1/11 \\).\n\nOr,\n\n2. \\( k < 0 \\) and \\( 11k -1 > 0 \\) => \\( k > 1/11 \\) and \\( k <0 \\), which is impossible.\n\nSo, only the first case applies: \\( 0 < k < 1/11 \\).\n\nBut in this case, since \\( k = a / b = (e^u)/(e^v) = e^{u - v} \\).\n\nSince \\( u = \\theta + \\phi \\), \\( v = \\theta - \\phi \\), so \\( u - v = 2 \\phi \\).\n\nSo, \\( k = e^{2 \\phi} \\).\n\nSo, \\( k > 0 \\), which is fine.\n\nSo, in Case 2, \\( 0 < k < 1/11 \\).\n\nSo, in total, the solutions are \\( k > 11 \\) or \\( 0 < k < 1/11 \\).\n\nBut \\( k = e^{2 \\phi} \\), which is always positive. So, the acceptable ranges for \\( k \\) are \\( k > 11 \\) or \\( 0 < k < 1/11 \\).\n\nSo, for each case, we can express \\( t \\) in terms of \\( k \\).\n\nSo, \\( t = \\frac{k - 11}{k(11k -1)} \\).\n\nBut \\( t = b^2 = e^{2v} \\), which must be positive. So, as long as numerator and denominator have the same sign, which is already handled by the cases.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a relationship between \\( u \\) and \\( v \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a ratio between \\( \\theta \\) and \\( \\phi \\). Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of this equation \\( 11 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) = \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) \\) as a condition on \\( \\theta \\) and \\( \\phi \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( \\alpha = \\theta + \\phi \\), \\( \\beta = \\theta - \\phi \\).\n\nThen, equation is \\( 11 \\cosh \\alpha = \\cosh \\beta \\).\n\nAlso, since \\( \\alpha = \\theta + \\phi \\), \\( \\beta = \\theta - \\phi \\), we can solve for \\( \\theta \\) and \\( \\phi \\):\n\n\\( \\theta = (\\alpha + \\beta)/2 \\),\n\n\\( \\phi = (\\alpha - \\beta)/2 \\).\n\nBut I don't know if this substitution helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express \\( \\cosh \\beta = 11 \\cosh \\alpha \\), and then use the identity \\( \\cosh^2 \\beta - \\sinh^2 \\beta = 1 \\).\n\nBut since \\( \\cosh \\beta = 11 \\cosh \\alpha \\), we can write \\( \\sinh \\beta = \\sqrt{\\cosh^2 \\beta -1} = \\sqrt{(11 \\cosh \\alpha)^2 -1} \\).\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express \\( \\cosh \\beta = 11 \\cosh \\alpha \\) as \\( \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) = 11 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) \\), and then use the formula for \\( \\cosh(A - B) \\) and \\( \\cosh(A + B) \\).\n\nRecall that:\n\n\\( \\cosh(A - B) = \\cosh A \\cosh B - \\sinh A \\sinh B \\),\n\n\\( \\cosh(A + B) = \\cosh A \\cosh B + \\sinh A \\sinh B \\).\n\nSo, substituting,\n\n\\( \\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) = 11 \\cosh(\\theta + \\phi) \\),\n\nbecomes,\n\n\\( \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi - \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi = 11 (\\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi + \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi) \\).\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n\\( \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi - \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi - 11 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi - 11 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi = 0 \\).\n\nFactor terms:\n\n\\( (\\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi - 11 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi) + (- \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi - 11 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi) = 0 \\).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( (-10 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi) + (-12 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi) = 0 \\).\n\nFactor out -2:\n\n\\( -2(5 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi + 6 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi) = 0 \\).\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\n\\( 5 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi + 6 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi = 0 \\).\n\nWait a minute, this is the same as equation (1) we had earlier when we substituted the parametrization. So, that brings us back to the same point.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is going in circles. Maybe I should try another strategy.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of parametrizing with hyperbola functions, perhaps use coordinates and vectors.\n\nSince the rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, and the diagonals are perpendicular, the rhombus is actually a kite as well, but since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal.\n\nBut another thought: The rhombus can be considered as a parallelogram with equal sides and perpendicular diagonals.\n\nWait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are always perpendicular. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other at the origin, the four points can be considered as \\( A = (a, b) \\), \\( C = (-a, -b) \\), \\( B = (c, d) \\), \\( D = (-c, -d) \\).\n\nSince \\( ABCD \\) is a rhombus, all sides are equal, so the distance between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) must equal the distance between \\( B \\) and \\( C \\).\n\nWait, let me compute \\( AB^2 \\) and \\( BC^2 \\).\n\n\\( AB^2 = (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 \\).\n\n\\( BC^2 = (-a - c)^2 + (-b - d)^2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2 \\).\n\nSet them equal:\n\n\\( (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2 \\).\n\nExpand both sides:\n\nLeft: \\( c\u00b2 - 2ac + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - 2bd + b\u00b2 \\).\n\nRight: \\( a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2 \\).\n\nSubtract left from right:\n\n\\( (a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 - 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2bd + d\u00b2) \\) = \\( 4ac + 4bd = 0 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( 4ac + 4bd = 0 \\) => \\( ac + bd = 0 \\). --- (A)\n\nWhich is the same as equation (1) we had earlier.\n\nSo, this gives a condition on \\( a, b, c, d \\).\n\nAdditionally, since \\( A = (a, b) \\) and \\( B = (c, d) \\) lie on the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\), we have:\n\nFor \\( A \\): \\( \\frac{a\u00b2}{20} - \\frac{b\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\) --- (B)\n\nFor \\( B \\): \\( \\frac{c\u00b2}{20} - \\frac{d\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\) --- (C)\n\nSo, we have three equations: (A), (B), and (C).\n\nOur goal is to find \\( BD^2 \\). The diagonal \\( BD \\) goes from \\( B = (c, d) \\) to \\( D = (-c, -d) \\). So, the length of \\( BD \\) is the distance between \\( (c, d) \\) and \\( (-c, -d) \\).\n\nCompute \\( BD^2 \\):\n\n\\( (-c - c)^2 + (-d - d)^2 = (-2c)^2 + (-2d)^2 = 4c\u00b2 + 4d\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) \\).\n\nSo, \\( BD^2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) \\).\n\nWe need to find the infimum of \\( BD^2 \\) over all such rhombi.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimal possible value of \\( 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) \\) given the constraints (A), (B), and (C).\n\nSo, our problem reduces to minimizing \\( c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 \\) subject to:\n\n1. \\( ac + bd = 0 \\) --- (A)\n\n2. \\( \\frac{a\u00b2}{20} - \\frac{b\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\) --- (B)\n\n3. \\( \\frac{c\u00b2}{20} - \\frac{d\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\) --- (C)\n\nSo, variables are \\( a, b, c, d \\), subject to these constraints.\n\nWe can perhaps express \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in terms of \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) using equation (A), then substitute into equation (B) to get a relation between \\( c \\) and \\( d \\), then use equation (C) to find a condition.\n\nFrom equation (A): \\( ac + bd = 0 \\).\n\nWe can write this as \\( a c = - b d \\).\n\nSo, \\( a = (-b d)/c \\), assuming \\( c \\neq 0 \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( b = (-a c)/d \\), assuming \\( d \\neq 0 \\).\n\nBut perhaps it's better to express \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in terms of \\( c \\) and \\( d \\), then substitute into equation (B).\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFrom equation (A): \\( a c = - b d \\).\n\nLet me solve for \\( a \\):\n\n\\( a = (-b d)/c \\).\n\nSubstitute into equation (B):\n\n\\( \\frac{a\u00b2}{20} - \\frac{b\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( \\frac{ ( (-b d / c )^2 ) }{20} - \\frac{b\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( \\frac{ b\u00b2 d\u00b2 }{20 c\u00b2 } - \\frac{b\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nFactor \\( b\u00b2 \\):\n\n\\( b\u00b2 \\left( \\frac{d\u00b2}{20 c\u00b2} - \\frac{1}{24} \\right) = 1 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( b\u00b2 = \\frac{1}{ \\left( \\frac{d\u00b2}{20 c\u00b2} - \\frac{1}{24} \\right) } \\).\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe instead, we can parametrize \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) using hyperbola parametrization, similar to earlier.\n\nLet me set \\( c = \\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\phi \\), \\( d = \\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\phi \\).\n\nSimilarly, from equation (A): \\( a c + b d = 0 \\).\n\nSo, \\( a \\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\phi + b \\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\phi = 0 \\).\n\nLet me solve for \\( a \\):\n\n\\( a = - \\frac{ b \\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\phi }{ \\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\phi } = - b \\sqrt{ \\frac{24}{20} } \\tanh \\phi = - b \\sqrt{ \\frac{6}{5} } \\tanh \\phi \\).\n\nSo, \\( a = - b \\sqrt{6/5} \\tanh \\phi \\).\n\nNow, substitute \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) into equation (B):\n\n\\( \\frac{a\u00b2}{20} - \\frac{b\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nSubstitute \\( a = - b \\sqrt{6/5} \\tanh \\phi \\):\n\n\\( \\frac{ (b\u00b2 (6/5) \\tanh\u00b2 \\phi ) }{20} - \\frac{b\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( \\frac{6 b\u00b2 \\tanh\u00b2 \\phi }{100} - \\frac{b\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\n\\( \\frac{3 b\u00b2 \\tanh\u00b2 \\phi }{50} - \\frac{b\u00b2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\nFactor \\( b\u00b2 \\):\n\n\\( b\u00b2 \\left( \\frac{3 \\tanh\u00b2 \\phi }{50} - \\frac{1}{24} \\right) = 1 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( b\u00b2 = \\frac{1}{ \\left( \\frac{3 \\tanh\u00b2 \\phi }{50} - \\frac{1}{24} \\right) } \\).\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit involved, but perhaps we can express everything in terms of \\( \\phi \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( t = \\tanh \\phi \\). Then, \\( \\tanh \\phi = t \\), so \\( \\phi = \\tanh^{-1} t \\), and \\( \\text{sech}^2 \\phi = 1 - t\u00b2 \\).\n\nBut perhaps it's better to express \\( \\tanh \\phi \\) as \\( t \\), so \\( \\tanh \\phi = t \\), which implies \\( \\phi = \\text{arctanh}(t) \\), and \\( \\text{csch}^2 \\phi = 1 / (1 - t\u00b2) \\), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express \\( \\tanh \\phi \\) in terms of \\( \\sinh \\phi \\) and \\( \\cosh \\phi \\), but that might not help.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write \\( \\tanh \\phi = \\sinh \\phi / \\cosh \\phi \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\tanh \\phi = \\sqrt{ \\frac{24}{20} } \\times \\frac{d}{c} \\).\n\nWait, because \\( c = \\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\phi \\), \\( d = \\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\phi \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\tanh \\phi = \\frac{d}{c} \\times \\sqrt{24/20} \\).\n\nWait, let me compute \\( \\tanh \\phi \\):\n\n\\( \\tanh \\phi = \\frac{\\sinh \\phi}{\\cosh \\phi} = \\frac{d / \\sqrt{24}}{c / \\sqrt{20}} = \\frac{d \\sqrt{20}}{c \\sqrt{24}} = \\frac{d}{c} \\sqrt{20/24} = \\frac{d}{c} \\sqrt{5/6} \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\tanh \\phi = \\frac{d}{c} \\sqrt{5/6} \\).\n\nSo, substituting back into the equation for \\( b\u00b2 \\):\n\n\\( b\u00b2 = \\frac{1}{ \\left( \\frac{3 (d/c)^2 (5/6) }{50} - \\frac{1}{24} \\right) } \\).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( b\u00b2 = \\frac{1}{ \\left( \\frac{15 (d/c)^2 }{300} - \\frac{1}{24} \\right) } = \\frac{1}{ \\left( \\frac{(d/c)^2 }{20} - \\frac{1}{24} \\right) } \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( b\u00b2 = \\frac{1}{ \\left( \\frac{(d/c)^2 }{20} - \\frac{1}{24} \\right) } \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( k = d/c \\).

But since \\( k = d/c \\), and \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) can be positive or negative, but \\( k\u00b2 \\) is positive regardless. So, we can consider \\( k > 0 \\) without loss of generality, as the expression for \\( BD^2 \\) is even in \\( k \\).\n\nSo, we can assume \\( k > 0 \\), so \\( \\sqrt{5/6} < k < \\sqrt{6/5} \\).\n\nSo, now, our problem reduces to minimizing the function \\( f(k) = 480 (1 + k\u00b2)/(6 -5k\u00b2) \\) for \\( k \\in (\\sqrt{5/6}, \\sqrt{6/5}) \\).\n\nTo find the minimal value of \\( f(k) \\), we can take the derivative of \\( f(k) \\) with respect to \\( k \\), set it to zero, and solve for \\( k \\).\n\nLet me compute \\( f(k) = 480 (1 + k\u00b2)/(6 -5k\u00b2) \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( f(k) = 480 \\times \\frac{1 + k\u00b2}{6 -5k\u00b2} \\).\n\nLet me compute the derivative \\( f'(k) \\).\n\nUsing the quotient rule:\n\nIf \\( f(k) = \\frac{N}{D} \\), where \\( N = 1 + k\u00b2 \\), \\( D = 6 -5k\u00b2 \\),\n\nthen,\n\n\\( f'(k) = \\frac{N' D - N D'}{D^2} \\).\n\nCompute N' = 2k,\n\nD' = -10k.\n\nSo,\n\n\\( f'(k) = \\frac{2k (6 -5k\u00b2) - (1 + k\u00b2)(-10k)}{(6 -5k\u00b2)^2} \\).\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nFirst term: \\( 2k (6 -5k\u00b2) = 12k -10k\u00b3 \\).\n\nSecond term: \\( - (1 + k\u00b2)(-10k) = 10k + 10k\u00b3 \\).\n\nSo, numerator:\n\n\\( (12k -10k\u00b3) + (10k +10k\u00b3) = 22k \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( f'(k) = \\frac{22k}{(6 -5k\u00b2)^2} \\).\n\nSet derivative equal to zero:\n\n\\( 22k = 0 \\) => \\( k = 0 \\).\n\nBut \\( k \\) is in \\( (\\sqrt{5/6}, \\sqrt{6/5}) \\), which is approximately (0.9129, 1.0954). So, \\( k = 0 \\) is not in the domain.\n\nTherefore, the derivative does not equal zero within the domain. So, the function \\( f(k) \\) has no critical points in the domain \\( (\\sqrt{5/6}, \\sqrt{6/5}) \\).\n\nTherefore, the extrema must occur at the endpoints of the interval.\n\nSo, we can evaluate \\( f(k) \\) as \\( k \\) approaches \\( \\sqrt{5/6} \\) from above and as \\( k \\) approaches \\( \\sqrt{6/5} \\) from below.\n\nCompute the limits:\n\nFirst, as \\( k \\to \\sqrt{5/6}^+ \\):\n\nCompute \\( f(k) = 480 \\times \\frac{1 + k\u00b2}{6 -5k\u00b2} \\).\n\nAt \\( k = \\sqrt{5/6} \\):\n\n\\( k\u00b2 = 5/6 \\).\n\nSo,\n\nNumerator: \\( 1 + 5/6 = 11/6 \\).\n\nDenominator: \\( 6 -5*(5/6) = 6 -25/6 = (36 -25)/6 = 11/6 \\).\n\nThus,\n\n\\( f(k) = 480 * (11/6)/(11/6) = 480 * 1 = 480 \\).\n\nSimilarly, as \\( k \\to \\sqrt{6/5}^- \\):\n\nCompute \\( f(k) \\).\n\nAt \\( k = \\sqrt{6/5} \\):\n\n\\( k\u00b2 = 6/5 \\).\n\nSo,\n\nNumerator: \\( 1 + 6/5 = 11/5 \\).\n\nDenominator: \\( 6 -5*(6/5) = 6 -6 = 0 \\).\n\nSo, as \\( k \\to \\sqrt{6/5}^- \\), denominator approaches 0 from positive side, numerator approaches 11/5, so \\( f(k) \\) approaches infinity.\n\nThus, the minimal value of \\( f(k) \\) is 480, achieved as \\( k \\) approaches \\( \\sqrt{5/6} \\) from above.\n\nBut wait, we must check if this is indeed attainable.\n\nBecause when \\( k = \\sqrt{5/6} \\), the denominator in \\( c\u00b2 = 120/(6 -5k\u00b2) \\) becomes zero, which would make \\( c\u00b2 \\) undefined. So, \\( k \\) cannot be exactly \\( \\sqrt{5/6} \\), only approaching it from above. Therefore, \\( f(k) \\) approaches 480 but doesn't actually reach it.\n\nThus, the infimum of \\( BD^2 \\) is 480, but it's never actually achieved; it's the greatest lower bound.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, when \\( k \\) approaches \\( \\sqrt{5/6} \\) from above, \\( f(k) \\) approaches 480, and as \\( k \\) approaches \\( \\sqrt{6/5} \\) from below, \\( f(k) \\) approaches infinity.\n\nSo, the minimal possible value of \\( BD^2 \\) is 480, but it's not attainable since \\( k \\) cannot be exactly \\( \\sqrt{5/6} \\). So, the infimum is 480.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombi. Since \\( BD^2 \\) can be made arbitrarily close to 480 but never less than 480, the greatest real number less than all \\( BD^2 \\) is 480.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if the infimum is 480, then for any \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), there exists a rhombus with \\( BD^2 < 480 + \\epsilon \\). But the problem is asking for the greatest real number \\( m \\) such that \\( m < BD^2 \\) for all rhombi. Since \\( BD^2 \\) can get arbitrarily close to 480, the greatest such \\( m \\) would be 480, because for any \\( m < 480 \\), there exists a rhombus with \\( BD^2 \\) less than \\( m \\). Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, actually, the infimum is 480, which is the greatest lower bound. So, for any \\( m < 480 \\), there exists a rhombus with \\( BD^2 \\) less than \\( m \\). But the problem is asking for the greatest \\( m \\) such that \\( m < BD^2 \\) for all rhombi. Since \\( BD^2 \\) can be as small as just above 480, the greatest such \\( m \\) is 480, because 480 is less than or equal to all \\( BD^2 \\), but since \\( BD^2 \\) can be made arbitrarily close to 480, 480 is the infimum.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think about it.\n\nIf the infimum is 480, then 480 is the smallest value that \\( BD^2 \\) can approach but not necessarily reach. So, for any \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), there exists a rhombus with \\( BD^2 < 480 + \\epsilon \\). But the problem asks for the greatest real number \\( m \\) such that \\( m < BD^2 \\) for all rhombi.\n\nSo, \\( m \\) must be less than every possible \\( BD^2 \\). Since \\( BD^2 \\) can be made as close to 480 as desired, \\( m \\) cannot be greater than 480. Because if \\( m \\) were greater than 480, say 481, then there exists a rhombus with \\( BD^2 = 480.5 \\), which is less than 481, contradicting \\( m < BD^2 \\) for all rhombi.\n\nTherefore, the greatest such \\( m \\) is 480. So, the answer is \\( \\boxed{480} \\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, in our calculation, as \\( k \\) approaches \\( \\sqrt{5/6} \\) from above, \\( BD^2 \\) approaches 480. So, for any \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), there exists a rhombus with \\( BD^2 \\) in \\( (480, 480 + \\epsilon) \\). So, the infimum is 480, and for any \\( m < 480 \\), there exists a rhombus with \\( BD^2 < m \\), which would mean that the greatest \\( m \\) satisfying \\( m < BD^2 \\) for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, no, if \\( m \\) is less than all \\( BD^2 \\), then \\( m \\) must be less than the infimum of \\( BD^2 \\), which is 480. But 480 is the infimum, so there are rhombi with \\( BD^2 \\) approaching 480. So, the greatest \\( m \\) that is less than all \\( BD^2 \\) is 480 because any \\( m \\) greater than 480 would not satisfy \\( m < BD^2 \\) for all rhombi, since some rhombi have \\( BD^2 \\) just above 480. Therefore, 480 is the greatest lower bound, so the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but hold on, in our earlier calculation, \\( BD^2 \\) approaches 480 from above as \\( k \\) approaches \\( \\sqrt{5/6} \\) from above. So, \\( BD^2 \\) can be made arbitrarily close to 480 but is always greater than 480. Therefore, the infimum is 480, but \\( BD^2 \\) is always greater than 480. So, the greatest real number less than all \\( BD^2 \\) is 480, because for any \\( m > 480 \\), there exists a rhombus with \\( BD^2 \\) less than \\( m \\), but 480 itself is the lower bound.\n\nWait, no, wait: If \\( BD^2 \\) can be as close to 480 as we want, but always greater than 480, then 480 is the infimum, and the greatest number less than all \\( BD^2 \\) would be 480, because any number less than 480 would not be less than all \\( BD^2 \\); for example, if \\( m = 480 \\), then \\( m < BD^2 \\) for all rhombi because \\( BD^2 \\) is always greater than 480. But if \\( m = 480 \\), it's not less than \\( BD^2 \\), it's equal to the infimum. Wait, no, actually, \\( BD^2 \\) is always greater than 480, so \\( 480 < BD^2 \\) for all rhombi. Therefore, the greatest real number \\( m \\) such that \\( m < BD^2 \\) for all rhombi is 480, because you can't have a larger \\( m \\) than 480 without violating the condition for some rhombus.\n\nWait, no, if \\( m = 480 \\), then \\( m \\) is not less than \\( BD^2 \\), because \\( BD^2 \\) approaches 480 but is always greater. So, \\( m \\) must be less than 480. But if you take \\( m = 480 \\), it's not less than \\( BD^2 \\); it's equal to the infimum. So, perhaps the greatest \\( m \\) is 480, but since \\( BD^2 \\) never actually reaches 480, the greatest \\( m \\) less than all \\( BD^2 \\) is 480. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: The infimum is 480, so the set of all \\( BD^2 \\) is \\( [480, \\infty) \\). Therefore, the greatest number less than all \\( BD^2 \\) is 480, because 480 is the smallest value in the set, and any number less than 480 would not be less than all \\( BD^2 \\) (since some \\( BD^2 \\) are exactly 480). Wait, no, in our case, the infimum is 480, but no \\( BD^2 \\) actually equals 480. So, the set is \\( (480, \\infty) \\). Therefore, the greatest number \\( m \\) such that \\( m < BD^2 \\) for all rhombi is 480, because for any \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), there exists a rhombus with \\( BD^2 < 480 + \\epsilon \\), but \\( BD^2 \\) is always greater than 480. So, 480 is the infimum, and the greatest lower bound.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\( \\boxed{480} \\).\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we consider the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) and a rhombus \\(ABCD\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. We aim to find the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi.\n\n1. **Hyperbola Parametrization**: Points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) on the hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions:\n   - \\(A = (\\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\theta, \\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\theta)\\)\n   - \\(B = (\\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\phi, \\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\phi)\\)\n\n2. **Diagonal Perpendicularity**: The diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) are perpendicular, leading to the condition:\n   \\[\n   xp + yq = 0\n   \\]\n   where \\(A = (x, y)\\) and \\(B = (p, q)\\).\n\n3. **Expression for \\(BD^2\\)**: The length of diagonal \\(BD\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = 4(c^2 + d^2)\n   \\]\n   where \\(B = (c, d)\\).\n\n4. **Minimizing \\(BD^2\\)**: By expressing \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) in terms of a parameter \\(k = \\frac{d}{c}\\) and using the hyperbola constraints, we derive:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = 480 \\cdot \\frac{1 + k^2}{6 - 5k^2}\n   \\]\n   The domain of \\(k\\) is \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{6}} < |k| < \\sqrt{\\frac{6}{5}}\\).\n\n5. **Finding the Infimum**: Evaluating the function as \\(k\\) approaches the boundaries, we find that \\(BD^2\\) approaches 480 but never actually reaches it. Thus, the infimum of \\(BD^2\\) is 480.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is the infimum, which is 480.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{480}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, which is also the center of the hyperbola. The task is to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, the square of the length of diagonal BD, across all possible such rhombuses.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, no, wait, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Or is that a kite? Let me double-check.\n\nNo, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular, but wait, no, wait\u2014actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Because a rhombus is a special type of parallelogram where all sides are equal, and in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that part is correct.\n\nSo, in this problem, the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the diagonals are straight lines passing through the origin, and they intersect at right angles. So, the rhombus is symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis, because the diagonals are straight lines through the origin.\n\nWait, but the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes as well, so that makes sense.\n\nSo, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points A, B, C, D must be arranged such that A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. So, if I consider diagonal AC, it passes through the origin, and so does diagonal BD.\n\nSince it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D would be (-p, -q). So, all four points are determined by two points, A and B, with C and D being the reflections through the origin.\n\nBut since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, and so on.\n\nWait, but since diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, the rhombus is determined by two lines through the origin, which are the diagonals. So, the diagonals are perpendicular, so they form four right angles at their intersection.\n\nBut the hyperbola is given, so all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, let me think about parametrizing the points. Since the diagonals are straight lines through the origin, they can be represented as lines with some slopes. Let me suppose that diagonal AC has a slope m, and diagonal BD has a slope -1/m because they are perpendicular. Alternatively, if diagonal AC is along the x-axis, then BD would be along the y-axis, but in this case, the hyperbola is symmetric, so the rhombus could be aligned in various ways.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to represent the points in terms of vectors. Since the origin is the midpoint, if A is (a, b), then C is (-a, -b). Similarly, if B is (c, d), then D is (-c, -d). Since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are all equal in length.\n\nSo, the length of AB is equal to the length of BC, etc.\n\nSo, let's compute AB. Point A is (a, b), point B is (c, d). The vector AB is (c - a, d - b). The length squared of AB is (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2.\n\nSimilarly, the length squared of BC is ( -a - c)^2 + (-b - d)^2, because point C is (-a, -b). Wait, no, point B is (c, d), point C is (-a, -b), so vector BC is (-a - c, -b - d). So, length squared is (-a - c)^2 + (-b - d)^2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2.\n\nSince AB = BC in a rhombus, their squared lengths must be equal:\n\n(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2.\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: (c^2 - 2ac + a^2) + (d^2 - 2bd + b^2) = c^2 + a^2 + d^2 + b^2 - 2ac - 2bd.\n\nRight side: (a^2 + 2ac + c^2) + (b^2 + 2bd + d^2) = a^2 + c^2 + b^2 + d^2 + 2ac + 2bd.\n\nSet them equal:\n\nc^2 + a^2 + d^2 + b^2 - 2ac - 2bd = a^2 + c^2 + b^2 + d^2 + 2ac + 2bd.\n\nSubtracting the right side from both sides:\n\n-4ac -4bd = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, that's one condition: ac + bd = 0.\n\nNow, since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the hyperbola equation:\n\nFor point A: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nFor point B: c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have these two equations for A and B, and also the condition ac + bd = 0.\n\nAdditionally, since diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1.\n\nBut wait, the diagonals are AC and BD. The slope of AC is (b - (-b))/(a - (-a)) = (2b)/(2a) = b/a.\n\nThe slope of BD is (d - (-d))/(c - (-c)) = (2d)/(2c) = d/c.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1:\n\n(b/a) * (d/c) = -1.\n\nSo, (b d)/(a c) = -1.\n\nWhich implies that b d = -a c.\n\nBut from earlier, we have a c + b d = 0.\n\nSo, substituting b d = -a c into a c + b d = 0, we get a c + (-a c) = 0, which is 0 = 0. So, the condition is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the key conditions are:\n\n1. a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\n2. c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\n3. b d = -a c.\n\nAdditionally, since diagonals are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1, which gives the same condition.\n\nSo, now, I need to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the distance between points B and D.\n\nWait, point B is (c, d), point D is (-c, -d). So, the distance BD is the distance between (c, d) and (-c, -d).\n\nWhich is sqrt[ (-c - c)^2 + (-d - d)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-2c)^2 + (-2d)^2 ] = sqrt[4c\u00b2 + 4d\u00b2] = 2 sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 is (2 sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, our target is to find the infimum of 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) over all possible points B = (c, d) on the hyperbola, such that there exists a point A = (a, b) on the hyperbola satisfying a c + b d = 0.\n\nSo, in other words, for each point B on the hyperbola, we can check if there exists a point A on the hyperbola such that a c + b d = 0, and then compute BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), and find the minimal possible BD\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, since BD\u00b2 is 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), we can think of it as 4 times the square of the distance from the origin to point B. So, if we can find the minimal value of c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 for points B on the hyperbola, that would give us the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because not every point B on the hyperbola can be part of such a rhombus. There's a constraint that there exists a point A on the hyperbola such that a c + b d = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 is not just the minimal distance squared from the origin to the hyperbola, but it's constrained by the existence of such a point A.\n\nWait, but perhaps the minimal c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 is the same as the minimal distance squared, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider the minimal distance squared from the origin to the hyperbola.\n\nWait, the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. The minimal distance squared from the origin to a point on the hyperbola can be found by minimizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 subject to x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nLet me set up the Lagrangian:\n\nL = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + \u03bb(1 - x\u00b2/20 + y\u00b2/24).\n\nTaking partial derivatives:\n\ndL/dx = 2x - (2\u03bb x)/20 = 0 => 2x (1 - \u03bb/20) = 0.\n\nSimilarly, dL/dy = 2y + (2\u03bb y)/24 = 0 => 2y (1 + \u03bb/24) = 0.\n\ndL/d\u03bb = 1 - x\u00b2/20 + y\u00b2/24 = 0.\n\nFrom dL/dx: Either x = 0 or \u03bb = 20.\n\nFrom dL/dy: Either y = 0 or \u03bb = -24.\n\nBut if x = 0, then from the hyperbola equation, 0 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 => y\u00b2 = -24, which is impossible. So, x cannot be 0.\n\nSimilarly, if y = 0, then x\u00b2/20 = 1 => x\u00b2 = 20, so x = \u00b1\u221a20 = \u00b12\u221a5. Then, the distance squared is 20 + 0 = 20.\n\nBut let's see if the other case is possible.\n\nCase 1: \u03bb = 20.\n\nThen, from dL/dy: 2y(1 + 20/24) = 0 => 2y(1 + 5/6) = 2y(11/6) = 0 => y = 0.\n\nBut then, as above, y = 0 leads to x = \u00b12\u221a5, which gives distance squared 20.\n\nCase 2: \u03bb = -24.\n\nFrom dL/dx: 2x(1 - (-24)/20) = 2x(1 + 24/20) = 2x(44/20) = 2x(11/5) = 0 => x = 0, which is impossible as before.\n\nSo, the only critical points are at y = 0, x = \u00b12\u221a5, which gives distance squared 20.\n\nTherefore, the minimal distance squared from the origin to the hyperbola is 20, achieved at (\u00b12\u221a5, 0).\n\nBut wait, in our problem, BD\u00b2 is 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), so if the minimal c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 is 20, then the minimal BD\u00b2 is 80.\n\nBut hold on, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2, which would be 80, but since BD\u00b2 cannot be less than 80, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 80.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Is 80 the minimal BD\u00b2? Because in the above, I considered the minimal c\u00b2 + d\u00b2, which is 20, so BD\u00b2 is 4*20=80.\n\nBut in our problem, the rhombus must have both points A and B on the hyperbola, and satisfy a c + b d = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 is not 20 because such a point A may not exist for point B at (2\u221a5, 0). Let me check.\n\nSuppose point B is (2\u221a5, 0). Then, c = 2\u221a5, d = 0.\n\nSo, condition a c + b d = 0 becomes a*(2\u221a5) + b*0 = 0 => a = 0.\n\nBut point A is (a, b) on the hyperbola, so a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nIf a=0, then 0 - b\u00b2/24 =1 => b\u00b2 = -24, which is impossible. So, there is no such point A when B is (2\u221a5, 0). Therefore, the point B cannot be (2\u221a5, 0) because it doesn't satisfy the condition a c + b d =0 for some A on the hyperbola.\n\nTherefore, the minimal c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 cannot be 20. So, I have to find the minimal c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 such that there exists a point A on the hyperbola with a c + b d = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to parameterize points A and B on the hyperbola with the condition a c + b d =0.\n\nLet me try to parameterize the hyperbola. Since it's a hyperbola of the form x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, with a\u00b2=20 and b\u00b2=24.\n\nA standard parametrization for such a hyperbola is x = a sec\u03b8, y = b tan\u03b8, where \u03b8 is a parameter.\n\nAlternatively, hyperbolic functions can be used: x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t.\n\nBut since hyperbola has two branches, depending on the sign. But in this case, since the rhombus can be on either branch, but since the points are arranged in a rhombus, perhaps they are on the same branch or different branches.\n\nWait, but in our case, points A and C are opposite each other through the origin, so if A is on one branch, C is on the other. Similarly for B and D.\n\nBut the hyperbola is symmetric, so perhaps both A and B can be on the right branch, but their reflections C and D would be on the left.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: If A is on the right branch (x positive), then C is (-a, -b), which would be on the left branch. Similarly, if B is on the right branch, D is on the left.\n\nSo, in any case, the points A and B can be on either branch, but their reflections will be on the opposite.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to parameterize points A and B using hyperbola parameters.\n\nLet me try using the hyperbolic parametrization.\n\nLet me set point A as (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t). Then, point C is (-sqrt(20) cosh t, -sqrt(24) sinh t).\n\nSimilarly, point B can be (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s), and point D is (-sqrt(20) cosh s, -sqrt(24) sinh s).\n\nNow, the condition is that a c + b d =0.\n\nSo, for point A: a = sqrt(20) cosh t, b = sqrt(24) sinh t.\n\nFor point B: c = sqrt(20) cosh s, d = sqrt(24) sinh s.\n\nSo, the condition is:\n\na c + b d = [sqrt(20) cosh t][sqrt(20) cosh s] + [sqrt(24) sinh t][sqrt(24) sinh s] = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(20 cosh t cosh s) + (24 sinh t sinh s) = 0.\n\nSo, 20 cosh t cosh s + 24 sinh t sinh s = 0.\n\nLet me factor this equation:\n\nDivide both sides by 4: 5 cosh t cosh s + 6 sinh t sinh s = 0.\n\nSo,\n\n5 cosh t cosh s + 6 sinh t sinh s = 0.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can express this in terms of hyperbolic identities.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to write this as:\n\n5 cosh(t + s) + (6 - 5) sinh(t + s) = something? Wait, no, because cosh(t + s) = cosh t cosh s + sinh t sinh s.\n\nWait, but our equation is 5 cosh t cosh s + 6 sinh t sinh s =0.\n\nSo, 5 (cosh t cosh s) + 6 (sinh t sinh s) =0.\n\nIf I factor out cosh t cosh s:\n\n= cosh t cosh s [5 + 6 (sinh t sinh s)/(cosh t cosh s)] =0.\n\nBut that might not help much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor this as:\n\n5 cosh t cosh s + 6 sinh t sinh s =0.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n5 cosh t cosh s = -6 sinh t sinh s.\n\nDivide both sides by cosh t cosh s:\n\n5 = -6 tanh t tanh s.\n\nSo,\n\ntanh t tanh s = -5/6.\n\nThat's a useful relation.\n\nSo, tanh t tanh s = -5/6.\n\nSo, if I let tanh t = u, then tanh s = (-5)/(6u).\n\nBut I also know that |tanh t| <1 and |tanh s| <1.\n\nSo, |(-5)/(6u)| <1 => |5/(6u)| <1 => |u| >5/6.\n\nSimilarly, since tanh t is between -1 and 1, u must satisfy |u| >5/6.\n\nSo, |tanh t| >5/6.\n\nSimilarly, for tanh s, since tanh s = -5/(6u), then |tanh s| =5/(6|u|) <5/(6*(5/6))=1. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, moving on.\n\nOur goal is to compute BD\u00b2 =4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nPoint B is (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s).\n\nSo, c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 =20 cosh\u00b2 s +24 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(20 cosh\u00b2 s +24 sinh\u00b2 s).\n\nSimplify:\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(20 cosh\u00b2 s +24 sinh\u00b2 s)= 80 cosh\u00b2 s +96 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nHmm, so BD\u00b2 is expressed in terms of s.\n\nBut we have a relation between t and s: tanh t tanh s = -5/6.\n\nBut perhaps I can express BD\u00b2 in terms of a single variable.\n\nLet me denote tanh s = v.\n\nSo, from tanh t tanh s = -5/6, we have tanh t = (-5)/(6v).\n\nBut since |tanh t| >5/6, as established earlier, then |v| must be such that |(-5)/(6v)| >5/6.\n\nWhich simplifies to |5/(6v)| >5/6 => |1/v| >1 => |v| <1.\n\nBut |v| is |tanh s|, which is always less than 1, so that's consistent.\n\nNow, let me express BD\u00b2 in terms of v.\n\nFirst, cosh\u00b2 s = 1/(1 - sinh\u00b2 s) = 1/(1 - v\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 s). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, cosh\u00b2 s =1 + sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nWait, no, correct identity: cosh\u00b2 s - sinh\u00b2 s =1.\n\nSo, cosh\u00b2 s =1 + sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nBut sinh s = v cosh s, because tanh s = sinh s / cosh s =v.\n\nSo, sinh s = v cosh s.\n\nThen, cosh\u00b2 s =1 + sinh\u00b2 s =1 + v\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 s.\n\nSo, cosh\u00b2 s (1 - v\u00b2) =1 => cosh\u00b2 s =1/(1 - v\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, sinh\u00b2 s = v\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 s = v\u00b2/(1 - v\u00b2).\n\nSo, now, BD\u00b2 =80 cosh\u00b2 s +96 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n=80*(1/(1 - v\u00b2)) +96*(v\u00b2/(1 - v\u00b2)).\n\n= [80 +96 v\u00b2]/(1 - v\u00b2).\n\n= [80 +96 v\u00b2]/(1 - v\u00b2).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nFactor numerator: 8*(10 + 12 v\u00b2) =8*2*(5 +6 v\u00b2)=16(5 +6 v\u00b2).\n\nWait, actually, 80=16*5, 96=16*6, so:\n\n=16*(5 +6 v\u00b2)/(1 -v\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=16*(5 +6 v\u00b2)/(1 -v\u00b2).\n\nNow, our goal is to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=16*(5 +6 v\u00b2)/(1 -v\u00b2).\n\nWe need to minimize this expression with respect to v, where |v| <1, and |v| >5/6 (since |tanh t|=|(-5)/(6v)|>5/6 => |v|<6/5*(5/6)=1, but from earlier, we have |v| <1.\n\nWait, no, wait.\n\nWait, earlier, we had tanh t = (-5)/(6v), so |tanh t|=|5/(6v)|>5/6.\n\nThus, |5/(6v)|>5/6 => |1/v|>1 => |v| <1.\n\nBut since |v| =|tanh s| <1, it's consistent.\n\nBut also, for tanh t to be real, v cannot be zero, because then tanh t would be undefined.\n\nWait, but in our case, if v=0, then tanh s=0, which implies s=0, but then sinh s=0, so point B would be at (sqrt(20),0), which as we saw earlier, doesn't have a corresponding point A on the hyperbola. So, v=0 is excluded.\n\nSo, our domain for v is |v| <1, and |v| >5/6.\n\nSo, v is in (-1, -5/6) U (5/6, 1).\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2=16*(5 +6 v\u00b2)/(1 -v\u00b2) over v in (-1, -5/6) U (5/6, 1).\n\nSince BD\u00b2 is even in v (because it's expressed in terms of v\u00b2), we can consider v>0, and then the result will be the same for v<0.\n\nSo, let's consider v>0 in (5/6,1).\n\nSo, let me set f(v) = (5 +6 v\u00b2)/(1 -v\u00b2).\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of f(v) over v in (5/6,1).\n\nSo, f(v) = (5 +6 v\u00b2)/(1 -v\u00b2).\n\nTo find the minimum, take derivative f\u2019(v) and set it to zero.\n\nCompute f\u2019(v):\n\nf\u2019(v) = [ (12v)(1 -v\u00b2) - (5 +6v\u00b2)(-2v) ] / (1 -v\u00b2)^2.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n12v(1 -v\u00b2) +2v(5 +6v\u00b2).\n\n=12v -12v\u00b3 +10v +12v\u00b3.\n\n= (12v +10v) + (-12v\u00b3 +12v\u00b3).\n\n=22v.\n\nSo, f\u2019(v)=22v/(1 -v\u00b2)^2.\n\nSet f\u2019(v)=0: 22v=0 => v=0, but v is in (5/6,1), so no critical points in this interval.\n\nTherefore, f(v) is increasing on (0,1), so on (5/6,1), f(v) is increasing.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value occurs at v=5/6.\n\nSo, compute f(5/6):\n\nf(5/6)= [5 +6*(25/36)] / [1 -25/36].\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n5 +6*(25/36)=5 + (150/36)=5 + (25/6)= (30/6)+(25/6)=55/6.\n\nDenominator: 1 -25/36=11/36.\n\nSo, f(5/6)= (55/6)/(11/36)= (55/6)*(36/11)= (55*6)/11=5*6=30.\n\nTherefore, f(v) has a minimum at v=5/6, with f(5/6)=30.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2=16*f(v) >=16*30=480.\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, wait, wait, hold on.\n\nWait, in our earlier substitution, BD\u00b2=16*(5 +6v\u00b2)/(1 -v\u00b2).\n\nBut when v=5/6, f(v)=30, so BD\u00b2=16*30=480.\n\nWait, but 480 is a pretty big number, but let's think about it.\n\nBut wait, earlier, when we thought the minimal BD\u00b2 was 80, but that was without considering the condition a c + b d =0. So, perhaps 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but let's verify.\n\nWait, when v=5/6, then tanh s=5/6.\n\nSo, sinh s = (5/6) cosh s.\n\nFrom cosh\u00b2 s - sinh\u00b2 s=1:\n\ncosh\u00b2 s - (25/36 cosh\u00b2 s)=1 => (11/36) cosh\u00b2 s=1 => cosh s=6/sqrt(11).\n\nSo, cosh s=6/sqrt(11), sinh s=5/sqrt(11).\n\nTherefore, point B is (sqrt(20)*cosh s, sqrt(24)*sinh s)= sqrt(20)*(6/sqrt(11)), sqrt(24)*(5/sqrt(11)).\n\nSo, c= sqrt(20)*(6/sqrt(11))= (6 sqrt(20))/sqrt(11).\n\nSimilarly, d= sqrt(24)*(5/sqrt(11))= (5 sqrt(24))/sqrt(11).\n\nSo, c\u00b2 + d\u00b2= (36*20)/11 + (25*24)/11= (720 +600)/11=1320/11=120.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2)=4*120=480.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, but cannot be smaller than that. So, the infimum is 480.\n\nBut wait, is 480 actually achievable? Because when v approaches 5/6 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nWait, but when v=5/6, it's exactly 480, as we saw.\n\nSo, 480 is achievable, so the infimum is 480.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question is asking for the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, meaning BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480 itself, because BD\u00b2 cannot be smaller than 480. Wait, but the wording is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of all real numbers m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nSince BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480, the supremum of such m is 480.\n\nBecause for any m <480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, which is not less than m, but for m=480, it's less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi since BD\u00b2 is at least 480.\n\nWait, no, if m=480, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, m=480 is not less than BD\u00b2, it's equal. So, the supremum of all m where m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 480, but since m must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, the supremum of such m is 480, but m cannot reach 480 because for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, m=480 is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, this is a bit tricky.\n\nThe infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, so BD\u00b2 \u2265480.\n\nSo, any m <480 will satisfy m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because BD\u00b2 is at least 480.\n\nBut the supremum of such m is 480, because you can get m as close to 480 as you like, but not reaching it.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but 480 is the infimum, and BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480.\n\nSo, the numbers m that are less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi must be less than or equal to 480.\n\nBut since m must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, and BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, then m must be less than or equal to 480.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, the supremum of such m is 480.\n\nBut since m must be strictly less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, and BD\u00b2 can be 480, then m must be less than 480. Therefore, the greatest such m is 480, but since 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 (as BD\u00b2 can be 480), the supremum is 480, but the maximum m satisfying m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, but since m cannot equal 480, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 480, because BD\u00b2 cannot be less than 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, then m must be less than 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, but since BD\u00b2 can be 480, then 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, m=480 is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the supremum is 480, but it's not attainable. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but actually, in real numbers, for any m <480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, so m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi only if m <=480. But since m must be strictly less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, and BD\u00b2 can be 480, then m must be <=480. But 480 is the infimum, so the supremum of m is 480.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think in terms of limit.\n\nAs the rhombus approaches the minimal BD\u00b2, m approaches 480.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but in reality, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so BD\u00b2 >=480 for all rhombi.\n\nTherefore, any number less than 480 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but 480 is the infimum.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nBut since 480 is achievable, then 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi because for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the supremum is 480, but the actual maximum m is less than 480.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 480.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, m is a lower bound for BD\u00b2, and the greatest such lower bound is the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 480.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 can be 480, m must be less than or equal to 480.\n\nBut the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, if m is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, then m must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 480.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, m must be less than 480.\n\nTherefore, the supremum of such m is 480, but since m cannot be equal to 480, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should express it as the infimum, which is 480.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recap.\n\nI found that BD\u00b2=16*(5 +6v\u00b2)/(1 -v\u00b2).\n\nThen, by analyzing the function f(v)=(5 +6v\u00b2)/(1 -v\u00b2), I found that the minimal value is 30 when v=5/6.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2=16*30=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be 480, and it's the minimal value.\n\nThus, for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 >=480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nBut wait, if BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, then m must be less than 480 to satisfy m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nBut 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so m can approach 480 but can't reach it.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSince BD\u00b2 can be 480, m must be less than 480 to satisfy m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nBut 480 is the infimum, so the supremum of all such m is 480.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me think about it differently.\n\nImagine that BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, but not smaller. So, for any m <480, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2=480, so m <480 < BD\u00b2 is not true for that rhombus. Therefore, m cannot be less than 480 if it has to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for a given m, to satisfy m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, m must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 480.\n\nBecause if m >=480, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, m is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the maximal m that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 480.\n\nWait, that can't be, because if m=480, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, m is equal to BD\u00b2, so m is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, m must be less than 480.\n\nBut then, the supremum of such m is 480.\n\nSo, the greatest real number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nBut in real numbers, 480 is the least upper bound for m.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\nI think that's the conclusion.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, which is also the center of the hyperbola. The task is to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, the square of the length of diagonal BD, across all possible such rhombuses.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, no, wait, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Or is that a kite? Let me double-check.\n\nNo, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular, but wait, no, wait\u2014actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Because a rhombus is a special type of parallelogram where all sides are equal, and in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that part is correct.\n\nSo, in this problem, the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the diagonals are straight lines passing through the origin, and they intersect at right angles. So, the rhombus is symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis, because the diagonals are straight lines through the origin.\n\nWait, but the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes as well, so that makes sense.\n\nSo, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points A, B, C, D must be arranged such that A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. So, if I consider diagonal AC, it passes through the origin, and so does diagonal BD.\n\nSince it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D would be (-p, -q). So, all four points are determined by two points, A and B, with C and D being the reflections through the origin.\n\nBut since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, and so on.\n\nWait, but since diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, the rhombus is determined by two lines through the origin, which are the diagonals. So, the diagonals are perpendicular, so they form four right angles at their intersection.\n\nBut the hyperbola is given, so all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, let me think about parametrizing the points. Since the diagonals are straight lines through the origin, they can be represented as lines with some slopes. Let me suppose that diagonal AC has a slope m, and diagonal BD has a slope -1/m because they are perpendicular. Alternatively, if diagonal AC is along the x-axis, then BD would be along the y-axis, but in this case, the hyperbola is symmetric, so the rhombus could be aligned in various ways.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to represent the points in terms of vectors. Since the origin is the midpoint, if A is (a, b), then C is (-a, -b). Similarly, if B is (c, d), then D is (-c, -d). Since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are all equal in length.\n\nSo, the length of AB is equal to the length of BC, etc.\n\nSo, let's compute AB. Point A is (a, b), point B is (c, d). The vector AB is (c - a, d - b). The length squared of AB is (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2.\n\nSimilarly, the length squared of BC is ( -a - c)^2 + (-b - d)^2, because point C is (-a, -b). Wait, no, point B is (c, d), point C is (-a, -b), so vector BC is (-a - c, -b - d). So, length squared is (-a - c)^2 + (-b - d)^2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2.\n\nSince AB = BC in a rhombus, their squared lengths must be equal:\n\n(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2.\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: (c^2 - 2ac + a^2) + (d^2 - 2bd + b^2) = c^2 + a^2 + d^2 + b^2 - 2ac - 2bd.\n\nRight side: (a^2 + 2ac + c^2) + (b^2 + 2bd + d^2) = a^2 + c^2 + b^2 + d^2 + 2ac + 2bd.\n\nSet them equal:\n\nc^2 + a^2 + d^2 + b^2 - 2ac - 2bd = a^2 + c^2 + b^2 + d^2 + 2ac + 2bd.\n\nSubtracting the right side from both sides:\n\n-4ac -4bd = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, that's one condition: ac + bd = 0.\n\nNow, since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the hyperbola equation:\n\nFor point A: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nFor point B: c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have these two equations for A and B, and also the condition ac + bd = 0.\n\nAdditionally, since diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1.\n\nBut wait, the diagonals are AC and BD. The slope of AC is (b - (-b))/(a - (-a)) = (2b)/(2a) = b/a.\n\nThe slope of BD is (d - (-d))/(c - (-c)) = (2d)/(2c) = d/c.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1:\n\n(b/a) * (d/c) = -1.\n\nSo, (b d)/(a c) = -1.\n\nWhich implies that b d = -a c.\n\nBut from earlier, we have a c + b d = 0.\n\nSo, substituting b d = -a c into a c + b d = 0, we get a c + (-a c) = 0, which is 0 = 0. So, the condition is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the key conditions are:\n\n1. a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\n2. c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\n3. b d = -a c.\n\nAdditionally, since diagonals are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1, which gives the same condition.\n\nSo, now, I need to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the distance between points B and D.\n\nWait, point B is (c, d), point D is (-c, -d). So, the distance BD is the distance between (c, d) and (-c, -d).\n\nWhich is sqrt[ (-c - c)^2 + (-d - d)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-2c)^2 + (-2d)^2 ] = sqrt[4c\u00b2 + 4d\u00b2] = 2 sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 is (2 sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, our target is to find the infimum of 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) over all possible points B = (c, d) on the hyperbola, such that there exists a point A = (a, b) on the hyperbola satisfying a c + b d = 0.\n\nSo, in other words, for each point B on the hyperbola, we can check if there exists a point A on the hyperbola such that a c + b d = 0, and then compute BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), and find the minimal possible BD\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, since BD\u00b2 is 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), we can think of it as 4 times the square of the distance from the origin to point B. So, if we can find the minimal value of c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 for points B on the hyperbola, that would give us the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because not every point B on the hyperbola can be part of such a rhombus. There's a constraint that there exists a point A on the hyperbola such that a c + b d = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 is not just the minimal distance squared from the origin to the hyperbola, but it's constrained by the existence of such a point A.\n\nWait, but perhaps the minimal c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 is the same as the minimal distance squared, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider the minimal distance squared from the origin to the hyperbola.\n\nWait, the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. The minimal distance squared from the origin to a point on the hyperbola can be found by minimizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 subject to x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nLet me set up the Lagrangian:\n\nL = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + \u03bb(1 - x\u00b2/20 + y\u00b2/24).\n\nTaking partial derivatives:\n\ndL/dx = 2x - (2\u03bb x)/20 = 0 => 2x (1 - \u03bb/20) = 0.\n\nSimilarly, dL/dy = 2y + (2\u03bb y)/24 = 0 => 2y (1 + \u03bb/24) = 0.\n\ndL/d\u03bb = 1 - x\u00b2/20 + y\u00b2/24 = 0.\n\nFrom dL/dx: Either x = 0 or \u03bb = 20.\n\nFrom dL/dy: Either y = 0 or \u03bb = -24.\n\nBut if x = 0, then from the hyperbola equation, 0 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 => y\u00b2 = -24, which is impossible. So, x cannot be 0.\n\nSimilarly, if y = 0, then x\u00b2/20 = 1 => x\u00b2 = 20, so x = \u00b1\u221a20 = \u00b12\u221a5. Then, the distance squared is 20 + 0 = 20.\n\nBut let's see if the other case is possible.\n\nCase 1: \u03bb = 20.\n\nThen, from dL/dy: 2y(1 + 20/24) = 0 => 2y(1 + 5/6) = 2y(11/6) = 0 => y = 0.\n\nBut then, as above, y = 0 leads to x = \u00b12\u221a5, which gives distance squared 20.\n\nCase 2: \u03bb = -24.\n\nFrom dL/dx: 2x(1 - (-24)/20) = 2x(1 + 24/20) = 2x(44/20) = 2x(11/5) = 0 => x = 0, which is impossible as before.\n\nSo, the only critical points are at y = 0, x = \u00b12\u221a5, which gives distance squared 20.\n\nTherefore, the minimal distance squared from the origin to the hyperbola is 20, achieved at (\u00b12\u221a5, 0).\n\nBut wait, in our problem, BD\u00b2 is 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), so if the minimal c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 is 20, then the minimal BD\u00b2 is 80.\n\nBut hold on, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2, which would be 80, but since BD\u00b2 cannot be less than 80, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 80.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Is 80 the minimal BD\u00b2? Because in the above, I considered the minimal c\u00b2 + d\u00b2, which is 20, so BD\u00b2 is 4*20=80.\n\nBut in our problem, the rhombus must have both points A and B on the hyperbola, and satisfy a c + b d = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 is not 20 because such a point A may not exist for point B at (2\u221a5, 0). Let me check.\n\nSuppose point B is (2\u221a5, 0). Then, c = 2\u221a5, d = 0.\n\nSo, condition a c + b d = 0 becomes a*(2\u221a5) + b*0 = 0 => a = 0.\n\nBut point A is (a, b) on the hyperbola, so a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nIf a=0, then 0 - b\u00b2/24 =1 => b\u00b2 = -24, which is impossible. So, there is no such point A when B is (2\u221a5, 0). Therefore, the point B cannot be (2\u221a5, 0) because it doesn't satisfy the condition a c + b d =0 for some A on the hyperbola.\n\nTherefore, the minimal c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 cannot be 20. So, I have to find the minimal c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 such that there exists a point A on the hyperbola with a c + b d = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to parameterize points A and B on the hyperbola with the condition a c + b d =0.\n\nLet me try to parameterize the hyperbola. Since it's a hyperbola of the form x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, with a\u00b2=20 and b\u00b2=24.\n\nA standard parametrization for such a hyperbola is x = a sec\u03b8, y = b tan\u03b8, where \u03b8 is a parameter.\n\nAlternatively, hyperbolic functions can be used: x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t.\n\nBut since hyperbola has two branches, depending on the sign. But in this case, since the rhombus can be on either branch, but since the points are arranged in a rhombus, perhaps they are on the same branch or different branches.\n\nWait, but in our case, points A and C are opposite each other through the origin, so if A is on one branch, C is on the other. Similarly for B and D.\n\nBut the hyperbola is symmetric, so perhaps both A and B can be on the right branch, but their reflections C and D would be on the left.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: If A is on the right branch (x positive), then C is (-a, -b), which would be on the left branch. Similarly, if B is on the right branch, D is on the left.\n\nSo, in any case, the points A and B can be on either branch, but their reflections will be on the opposite.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to parameterize points A and B using hyperbola parameters.\n\nLet me try using the hyperbolic parametrization.\n\nLet me set point A as (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t). Then, point C is (-sqrt(20) cosh t, -sqrt(24) sinh t).\n\nSimilarly, point B can be (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s), and point D is (-sqrt(20) cosh s, -sqrt(24) sinh s).\n\nNow, the condition is that a c + b d =0.\n\nSo, for point A: a = sqrt(20) cosh t, b = sqrt(24) sinh t.\n\nFor point B: c = sqrt(20) cosh s, d = sqrt(24) sinh s.\n\nSo, the condition is:\n\na c + b d = [sqrt(20) cosh t][sqrt(20) cosh s] + [sqrt(24) sinh t][sqrt(24) sinh s] = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(20 cosh t cosh s) + (24 sinh t sinh s) = 0.\n\nSo, 20 cosh t cosh s + 24 sinh t sinh s = 0.\n\nLet me factor this equation:\n\nDivide both sides by 4: 5 cosh t cosh s + 6 sinh t sinh s = 0.\n\nSo,\n\n5 cosh t cosh s + 6 sinh t sinh s = 0.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can express this in terms of hyperbolic identities.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to write this as:\n\n5 cosh(t + s) + (6 - 5) sinh(t + s) = something? Wait, no, because cosh(t + s) = cosh t cosh s + sinh t sinh s.\n\nWait, but our equation is 5 cosh t cosh s + 6 sinh t sinh s =0.\n\nSo, 5 (cosh t cosh s) + 6 (sinh t sinh s) =0.\n\nIf I factor out cosh t cosh s:\n\n= cosh t cosh s [5 + 6 (sinh t sinh s)/(cosh t cosh s)] =0.\n\nBut that might not help much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor this as:\n\n5 cosh t cosh s + 6 sinh t sinh s =0.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n5 cosh t cosh s = -6 sinh t sinh s.\n\nDivide both sides by cosh t cosh s:\n\n5 = -6 tanh t tanh s.\n\nSo,\n\ntanh t tanh s = -5/6.\n\nThat's a useful relation.\n\nSo, tanh t tanh s = -5/6.\n\nSo, if I let tanh t = u, then tanh s = (-5)/(6u).\n\nBut I also know that |tanh t| <1 and |tanh s| <1.\n\nSo, |(-5)/(6u)| <1 => |5/(6u)| <1 => |u| >5/6.\n\nSimilarly, since tanh t is between -1 and 1, u must satisfy |u| >5/6.\n\nSo, |tanh t| >5/6.\n\nSimilarly, for tanh s, since tanh s = -5/(6u), then |tanh s| =5/(6|u|) <5/(6*(5/6))=1. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, moving on.\n\nOur goal is to compute BD\u00b2 =4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nPoint B is (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s).\n\nSo, c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 =20 cosh\u00b2 s +24 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(20 cosh\u00b2 s +24 sinh\u00b2 s).\n\nSimplify:\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(20 cosh\u00b2 s +24 sinh\u00b2 s)= 80 cosh\u00b2 s +96 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nHmm, so BD\u00b2 is expressed in terms of s.\n\nBut we have a relation between t and s: tanh t tanh s = -5/6.\n\nBut perhaps I can express BD\u00b2 in terms of a single variable.\n\nLet me denote tanh s = v.\n\nSo, from tanh t tanh s = -5/6, we have tanh t = (-5)/(6v).\n\nBut since |tanh t| >5/6, as established earlier, then |v| must be such that |(-5)/(6v)| >5/6.\n\nWhich simplifies to |5/(6v)| >5/6 => |1/v| >1 => |v| <1.\n\nBut |v| is |tanh s|, which is always less than 1, so that's consistent.\n\nNow, let me express BD\u00b2 in terms of v.\n\nFirst, cosh\u00b2 s = 1/(1 - sinh\u00b2 s) = 1/(1 - v\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 s). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, cosh\u00b2 s =1 + sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nWait, no, correct identity: cosh\u00b2 s - sinh\u00b2 s =1.\n\nSo, cosh\u00b2 s =1 + sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nBut sinh s = v cosh s, because tanh s = sinh s / cosh s =v.\n\nSo, sinh s = v cosh s.\n\nThen, cosh\u00b2 s =1 + sinh\u00b2 s =1 + v\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 s.\n\nSo, cosh\u00b2 s (1 - v\u00b2) =1 => cosh\u00b2 s =1/(1 - v\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, sinh\u00b2 s = v\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 s = v\u00b2/(1 - v\u00b2).\n\nSo, now, BD\u00b2 =80 cosh\u00b2 s +96 sinh\u00b2 s.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n=80*(1/(1 - v\u00b2)) +96*(v\u00b2/(1 - v\u00b2)).\n\n= [80 +96 v\u00b2]/(1 - v\u00b2).\n\n= [80 +96 v\u00b2]/(1 - v\u00b2).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nFactor numerator: 8*(10 + 12 v\u00b2) =8*2*(5 +6 v\u00b2)=16(5 +6 v\u00b2).\n\nWait, actually, 80=16*5, 96=16*6, so:\n\n=16*(5 +6 v\u00b2)/(1 -v\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=16*(5 +6 v\u00b2)/(1 -v\u00b2).\n\nNow, our goal is to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=16*(5 +6 v\u00b2)/(1 -v\u00b2).\n\nWe need to minimize this expression with respect to v, where |v| <1, and |v| >5/6 (since |tanh t|=|(-5)/(6v)|>5/6 => |v|<6/5*(5/6)=1, but from earlier, we have |v| <1.\n\nWait, no, wait.\n\nWait, earlier, we had tanh t = (-5)/(6v), so |tanh t|=|5/(6v)|>5/6.\n\nThus, |5/(6v)|>5/6 => |1/v|>1 => |v| <1.\n\nBut since |v| =|tanh s| <1, it's consistent.\n\nBut also, for tanh t to be real, v cannot be zero, because then tanh t would be undefined.\n\nWait, but in our case, if v=0, then tanh s=0, which implies s=0, but then sinh s=0, so point B would be at (sqrt(20),0), which as we saw earlier, doesn't have a corresponding point A on the hyperbola. So, v=0 is excluded.\n\nSo, our domain for v is |v| <1, and |v| >5/6.\n\nSo, v is in (-1, -5/6) U (5/6, 1).\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2=16*(5 +6 v\u00b2)/(1 -v\u00b2) over v in (-1, -5/6) U (5/6, 1).\n\nSince BD\u00b2 is even in v (because it's expressed in terms of v\u00b2), we can consider v>0, and then the result will be the same for v<0.\n\nSo, let's consider v>0 in (5/6,1).\n\nSo, let me set f(v) = (5 +6 v\u00b2)/(1 -v\u00b2).\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of f(v) over v in (5/6,1).\n\nSo, f(v) = (5 +6 v\u00b2)/(1 -v\u00b2).\n\nTo find the minimum, take derivative f\u2019(v) and set it to zero.\n\nCompute f\u2019(v):\n\nf\u2019(v) = [ (12v)(1 -v\u00b2) - (5 +6v\u00b2)(-2v) ] / (1 -v\u00b2)^2.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n12v(1 -v\u00b2) +2v(5 +6v\u00b2).\n\n=12v -12v\u00b3 +10v +12v\u00b3.\n\n= (12v +10v) + (-12v\u00b3 +12v\u00b3).\n\n=22v.\n\nSo, f\u2019(v)=22v/(1 -v\u00b2)^2.\n\nSet f\u2019(v)=0: 22v=0 => v=0, but v is in (5/6,1), so no critical points in this interval.\n\nTherefore, f(v) is increasing on (0,1), so on (5/6,1), f(v) is increasing.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value occurs at v=5/6.\n\nSo, compute f(5/6):\n\nf(5/6)= [5 +6*(25/36)] / [1 -25/36].\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n5 +6*(25/36)=5 + (150/36)=5 + (25/6)= (30/6)+(25/6)=55/6.\n\nDenominator: 1 -25/36=11/36.\n\nSo, f(5/6)= (55/6)/(11/36)= (55/6)*(36/11)= (55*6)/11=5*6=30.\n\nTherefore, f(v) has a minimum at v=5/6, with f(5/6)=30.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2=16*f(v) >=16*30=480.\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, wait, wait, hold on.\n\nWait, in our earlier substitution, BD\u00b2=16*(5 +6v\u00b2)/(1 -v\u00b2).\n\nBut when v=5/6, f(v)=30, so BD\u00b2=16*30=480.\n\nWait, but 480 is a pretty big number, but let's think about it.\n\nBut wait, earlier, when we thought the minimal BD\u00b2 was 80, but that was without considering the condition a c + b d =0. So, perhaps 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but let's verify.\n\nWait, when v=5/6, then tanh s=5/6.\n\nSo, sinh s = (5/6) cosh s.\n\nFrom cosh\u00b2 s - sinh\u00b2 s=1:\n\ncosh\u00b2 s - (25/36 cosh\u00b2 s)=1 => (11/36) cosh\u00b2 s=1 => cosh s=6/sqrt(11).\n\nSo, cosh s=6/sqrt(11), sinh s=5/sqrt(11).\n\nTherefore, point B is (sqrt(20)*cosh s, sqrt(24)*sinh s)= sqrt(20)*(6/sqrt(11)), sqrt(24)*(5/sqrt(11)).\n\nSo, c= sqrt(20)*(6/sqrt(11))= (6 sqrt(20))/sqrt(11).\n\nSimilarly, d= sqrt(24)*(5/sqrt(11))= (5 sqrt(24))/sqrt(11).\n\nSo, c\u00b2 + d\u00b2= (36*20)/11 + (25*24)/11= (720 +600)/11=1320/11=120.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2)=4*120=480.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, but cannot be smaller than that. So, the infimum is 480.\n\nBut wait, is 480 actually achievable? Because when v approaches 5/6 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nWait, but when v=5/6, it's exactly 480, as we saw.\n\nSo, 480 is achievable, so the infimum is 480.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question is asking for the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, meaning BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480 itself, because BD\u00b2 cannot be smaller than 480. Wait, but the wording is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of all real numbers m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nSince BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480, the supremum of such m is 480.\n\nBecause for any m <480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, which is not less than m, but for m=480, it's less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi since BD\u00b2 is at least 480.\n\nWait, no, if m=480, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, m=480 is not less than BD\u00b2, it's equal. So, the supremum of all m where m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 480, but since m must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, the supremum of such m is 480, but m cannot reach 480 because for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, m=480 is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, this is a bit tricky.\n\nThe infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, so BD\u00b2 \u2265480.\n\nSo, any m <480 will satisfy m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because BD\u00b2 is at least 480.\n\nBut the supremum of such m is 480, because you can get m as close to 480 as you like, but not reaching it.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but 480 is the infimum, and BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480.\n\nSo, the numbers m that are less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi must be less than or equal to 480.\n\nBut since m must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, and BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, then m must be less than or equal to 480.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, the supremum of such m is 480.\n\nBut since m must be strictly less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, and BD\u00b2 can be 480, then m must be less than 480. Therefore, the greatest such m is 480, but since 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 (as BD\u00b2 can be 480), the supremum is 480, but the maximum m satisfying m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, but since m cannot equal 480, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 480, because BD\u00b2 cannot be less than 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, then m must be less than 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, but since BD\u00b2 can be 480, then 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, m=480 is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the supremum is 480, but it's not attainable. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but actually, in real numbers, for any m <480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, so m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi only if m <=480. But since m must be strictly less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, and BD\u00b2 can be 480, then m must be <=480. But 480 is the infimum, so the supremum of m is 480.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think in terms of limit.\n\nAs the rhombus approaches the minimal BD\u00b2, m approaches 480.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but in reality, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so BD\u00b2 >=480 for all rhombi.\n\nTherefore, any number less than 480 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but 480 is the infimum.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nBut since 480 is achievable, then 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi because for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the supremum is 480, but the actual maximum m is less than 480.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 480.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, m is a lower bound for BD\u00b2, and the greatest such lower bound is the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 480.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 can be 480, m must be less than or equal to 480.\n\nBut the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, if m is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, then m must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 480.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, m must be less than 480.\n\nTherefore, the supremum of such m is 480, but since m cannot be equal to 480, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should express it as the infimum, which is 480.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recap.\n\nI found that BD\u00b2=16*(5 +6v\u00b2)/(1 -v\u00b2).\n\nThen, by analyzing the function f(v)=(5 +6v\u00b2)/(1 -v\u00b2), I found that the minimal value is 30 when v=5/6.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2=16*30=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be 480, and it's the minimal value.\n\nThus, for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 >=480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nBut wait, if BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, then m must be less than 480 to satisfy m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nBut 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so m can approach 480 but can't reach it.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSince BD\u00b2 can be 480, m must be less than 480 to satisfy m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nBut 480 is the infimum, so the supremum of all such m is 480.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me think about it differently.\n\nImagine that BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, but not smaller. So, for any m <480, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2=480, so m <480 < BD\u00b2 is not true for that rhombus. Therefore, m cannot be less than 480 if it has to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for a given m, to satisfy m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, m must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 480.\n\nBecause if m >=480, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, m is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the maximal m that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 480.\n\nWait, that can't be, because if m=480, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, m is equal to BD\u00b2, so m is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, m must be less than 480.\n\nBut then, the supremum of such m is 480.\n\nSo, the greatest real number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nBut in real numbers, 480 is the least upper bound for m.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\nI think that's the conclusion.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all rhombuses \\( ABCD \\) inscribed in the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\), with diagonals intersecting at the origin.\n\n1. **Understanding the Rhombus and Hyperbola**:\n   - The rhombus \\( ABCD \\) has diagonals intersecting at the origin, implying symmetry about both axes.\n   - Points \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) are reflections of each other through the origin, as are \\( B \\) and \\( D \\).\n\n2. **Conditions for the Rhombus**:\n   - Points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) lie on the hyperbola.\n   - The condition \\( ac + bd = 0 \\) arises from the equality of side lengths in the rhombus.\n   - The diagonals are perpendicular, leading to the relation \\( \\frac{bd}{ac} = -1 \\).\n\n3. **Parametrization and Calculations**:\n   - Using hyperbolic functions, points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are parametrized as \\( ( \\sqrt{20} \\cosh t, \\sqrt{24} \\sinh t ) \\) and \\( ( \\sqrt{20} \\cosh s, \\sqrt{24} \\sinh s ) \\), respectively.\n   - The condition \\( \\tanh t \\tanh s = -\\frac{5}{6} \\) is derived, leading to expressions for \\( BD^2 \\) in terms of \\( v = \\tanh s \\).\n\n4. **Minimizing \\( BD^2 \\)**:\n   - The expression for \\( BD^2 \\) is simplified to \\( 16 \\cdot \\frac{5 + 6v^2}{1 - v^2} \\).\n   - Analyzing this function, the minimal value occurs at \\( v = \\frac{5}{6} \\), yielding \\( BD^2 = 480 \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The infimum of \\( BD^2 \\) is 480, meaning \\( BD^2 \\) cannot be smaller than 480 for any such rhombus.\n   - Therefore, the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all rhombuses is 480.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{480}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis.\n\nThen, there are four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. Hmm, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.\n\nI need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, BD is one of the diagonals, and I need to find the supremum (the least upper bound) of BD\u00b2, but the answer should be the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all possible such rhombi. Wait, no, actually, I think I misread. It says the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, the infimum of BD\u00b2, but wait, no. Wait, the problem is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the largest number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all possible rhombi. So, m is the infimum of BD\u00b2, because it's the greatest lower bound. But wait, no, if m is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, then m should be the minimum of BD\u00b2. Wait, but the question says the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to some value from above, then m is that value. So, m is the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the minimum possible BD\u00b2, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to parametrize the problem.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, and they are perpendicular.\n\nLet me denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Let me denote points A and C as endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D as endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes, I can assume that the diagonals are along the coordinate axes or some lines through the origin.\n\nBut wait, the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes and the origin. So, if the rhombus is such that its diagonals are along the coordinate axes, then points A and C would be on one axis, and points B and D on the other. But in that case, the points would be on the hyperbola, but hyperbola doesn't intersect the coordinate axes except at infinity. Wait, but the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. So, when x=0, y\u00b2 = -24*(1), which is not possible. Similarly, when y=0, x\u00b2=20, so x=\u00b1\u221a20. So, the hyperbola only intersects the x-axis at (\u00b1\u221a20, 0), but not the y-axis. So, if a diagonal is along the y-axis, then points B and D would have x=0, which is impossible because the hyperbola doesn't have points there except at infinity.\n\nSo, that suggests that the diagonals can't be along the coordinate axes. Therefore, the diagonals must be along some other lines passing through the origin, but not aligned with the axes. So, perhaps the diagonals are symmetric with respect to the origin, but not along the axes.\n\nSo, let's denote the diagonals as vectors. Let me think of the diagonals as vectors. So, if AC and BD are the diagonals, then the coordinates of the points can be written in terms of vectors from the origin.\n\nSince the rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, each vertex can be represented as a vector from the origin. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, point B would be (u, v), and point D would be (-u, -v).\n\nSince all four points lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, and similarly for u and v.\n\nNow, because ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the lengths of AB, BC, CD, DA are equal.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, the vectors of the diagonals should satisfy certain conditions. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, and they are perpendicular. So, the dot product of vectors AC and BD should be zero.\n\nSo, the vector AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, vector BD is from B to D, which is (-2u, -2v). But wait, actually, AC is from A to C, which is ( -x -x, -y - y )? Wait, no, AC is from A to C, which is (C - A). So, C is (-x, -y), so AC is (-x -x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is D - B = (-u - u, -v - v) = (-2u, -2v). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if B is (u, v), then D is (-u, -v). So, BD is D - B = (-u - u, -v - v) = (-2u, -2v). So, the vectors of the diagonals AC and BD are (-2x, -2y) and (-2u, -2v). Since the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, (-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 0 \u2192 4xu + 4yv = 0 \u2192 xu + yv = 0.\n\nSo, the condition is xu + yv = 0. So, that's one condition.\n\nAnother condition is that all four points lie on the hyperbola. So, for points A and C: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 and same for B and D: u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nNow, I need to find BD\u00b2. So, BD is the diagonal from B to D. The length of BD is the distance between B and D. Since B is (u, v) and D is (-u, -v), the distance between them is sqrt[( -u - u )\u00b2 + ( -v - v )\u00b2] = sqrt[(-2u)\u00b2 + (-2v)^2] = sqrt[4u\u00b2 +4v\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2). Therefore, BD\u00b2 = (2*sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). So, I need to find the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2, which would be 4 times the infimum of (u\u00b2 +v\u00b2). Wait, but wait, the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2. Because if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily small, then the infimum is zero, but perhaps it's bounded below by some positive number.\n\nBut wait, since the points B and D lie on the hyperbola, u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 =1. So, u\u00b2 = 20(1 + v\u00b2/24). So, u\u00b2 = 20 + (20/24)v\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6)v\u00b2. So, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6)v\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = 20 + (11/6)v\u00b2. So, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = 20 + (11/6)v\u00b2. Since v\u00b2 is non-negative, the minimum of u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 is 20, achieved when v=0. But wait, if v=0, then from the hyperbola equation, u\u00b2=20*(1) =20, so u=\u00b1\u221a20. So, points B and D would be (\u221a20,0) and (-\u221a20,0). But then, the other diagonal AC would have points A and C. Wait, but if points B and D are on the x-axis, then points A and C must be on the hyperbola as well.\n\nWait, but if we have points A and C on the hyperbola, then their coordinates must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. So, if points A and C are (x, y) and (-x, -y), then the diagonal AC has length 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), and the diagonal BD has length 2*sqrt(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2). But wait, in this case, if v=0, then u=\u00b1\u221a20, so BD\u00b2=4*(20 +0)=80.\n\nBut wait, if v=0, then from the condition xu + yv=0, we have x*u + y*0 =0 \u2192 x*u=0. So, since u=\u221a20 or -\u221a20, which is non-zero, then x must be zero. But if x=0, then from the hyperbola equation, 0 - y\u00b2/24=1 \u2192 y\u00b2= -24, which is impossible. So, this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, v cannot be zero, because that would require x=0, which is impossible on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 cannot be 80, because that would require points B and D to be on the x-axis, which is impossible due to the hyperbola's shape.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is greater than 80. Hmm, wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because when v approaches zero, u approaches \u221a20, but x must approach zero, which is impossible because then y would have to be imaginary. So, perhaps BD\u00b2 cannot be less than a certain value.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let me consider the two diagonals AC and BD as vectors. Let me denote vector AC as (p, q), so points A and C are (p/2, q/2) and (-p/2, -q/2). Similarly, vector BD is (r, s), so points B and D are (r/2, s/2) and (-r/2, -s/2).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, the sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, etc.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the properties of the rhombus. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the dot product of AC and BD is zero: (p, q)\u00b7(r, s) = pr + qs =0.\n\nAlso, all four points lie on the hyperbola, so for point A: (p/2)^2 /20 - (q/2)^2 /24 =1 \u2192 p\u00b2/(4*20) - q\u00b2/(4*24) =1 \u2192 p\u00b2/(80) - q\u00b2/(96) =1.\n\nSimilarly, for point B: (r/2)^2 /20 - (s/2)^2 /24 =1 \u2192 r\u00b2/(80) - s\u00b2/(96) =1.\n\nSo, both points A and B lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/80 - y\u00b2/96 =1, which is a scaled-down version of the original hyperbola.\n\nSo, we have two points (p/2, q/2) and (r/2, s/2) on the hyperbola x\u00b2/80 - y\u00b2/96 =1.\n\nAdditionally, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular, so pr + qs=0.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2. BD is the distance between B and D, which is sqrt[(r - (-r))\u00b2 + (s - (-s))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2r)^2 + (2s)^2] = 2*sqrt(r\u00b2 +s\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 =4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2).\n\nSo, our goal is to minimize BD\u00b2=4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2) subject to the conditions that (r\u00b2)/80 - (s\u00b2)/96 =1 and pr + qs=0.\n\nWait, but we have another condition from the rhombus: the sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, etc.\n\nAlternatively, since the rhombus can be considered as a parallelogram with equal sides, we can use the fact that the sides are equal vectors.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to consider the coordinates of the rhombus.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin. Let\u2019s denote point A as (x1, y1), point C as (-x1, -y1), point B as (x2, y2), and point D as (-x2, -y2).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nSo, the distance AB should equal the distance BC.\n\nDistance AB: sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2].\n\nDistance BC: sqrt[(-x1 - x2)^2 + (-y1 - y2)^2].\n\nSo, AB\u00b2 = (x2 -x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2.\n\nBC\u00b2 = (-x1 -x2)^2 + (-y1 - y2)^2 = (x1 +x2)^2 + (y1 + y2)^2.\n\nSince AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2,\n\n(x2 -x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 = (x1 +x2)^2 + (y1 + y2)^2.\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: x2\u00b2 - 2x1x2 +x1\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 - 2y1y2 + y1\u00b2.\n\nRight side: x1\u00b2 + 2x1x2 +x2\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 + 2y1y2 + y2\u00b2.\n\nSubtracting left side from right side:\n\n[ x1\u00b2 + 2x1x2 +x2\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 + 2y1y2 + y2\u00b2 ] - [ x2\u00b2 - 2x1x2 +x1\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 - 2y1y2 + y1\u00b2 ] = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n( x1\u00b2 + 2x1x2 +x2\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 + 2y1y2 + y2\u00b2 ) - ( x2\u00b2 - 2x1x2 +x1\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 - 2y1y2 + y1\u00b2 ) \n\n= 2x1x2 + 2y1y2 - (-2x1x2) - (-2y1y2)\n\nWait, no, let me compute term by term.\n\nx1\u00b2 cancels with -x1\u00b2.\n\nx2\u00b2 cancels with -x2\u00b2.\n\ny1\u00b2 cancels with -y1\u00b2.\n\ny2\u00b2 cancels with -y2\u00b2.\n\nSo, what remains is 2x1x2 + 2y1y2 - (-2x1x2) - (-2y1y2). Wait, no:\n\nWait, the right side has +2x1x2 and +2y1y2, and the left side has -2x1x2 and -2y1y2.\n\nWait, actually, let me write it as:\n\nRight side - left side:\n\n(2x1x2 + 2y1y2) - (-2x1x2 - 2y1y2) = 4x1x2 +4y1y2.\n\nSo, 4x1x2 +4y1y2 =0 \u2192 x1x2 + y1y2 =0.\n\nSo, we have another condition: x1x2 + y1y2 =0.\n\nEarlier, we had from the diagonals being perpendicular: pr + qs=0, which in this case, since pr corresponds to x1x2 and qs corresponds to y1y2, so it's the same condition: x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nSo, to recap, the conditions are:\n\n1. Points A and C: x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 =1.\n\n2. Points B and D: x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 =1.\n\n3. Diagonals are perpendicular: x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nWe need to find the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nSo, our goal is to minimize 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2) given that x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 =1 and x1x2 + y1y2=0, with x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit involved. Maybe we can parameterize the points.\n\nLet me parametrize point A as (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8). Because for hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2=1, a parametrization is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, point B can be parametrized as (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6).\n\nThen, the condition x1x2 + y1y2=0 becomes:\n\nsqrt(20) sec\u03b8 * sqrt(20) sec\u03c6 + sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 * sqrt(24) tan\u03c6 =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0.\n\nSo, 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 = -24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6.\n\nDivide both sides by sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 (assuming they are non-zero, which they are because sec\u03b8 and sec\u03c6 are at least 1 or less than -1).\n\n20 = -24 (sin\u03b8 / cos\u03b8)(sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6) / (1/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6)) )\n\nWait, maybe it's better to write tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = (sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8)(sin\u03c6/cos\u03c6) = (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6).\n\nSo, 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0 \u2192 20/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) +24 (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6:\n\n20 +24 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6=0 \u2192 24 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -20 \u2192 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -20/24 = -5/6.\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, that's one equation.\n\nNow, we can express BD\u00b2 as 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2) =4[20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6].\n\nWait, because x2\u00b2 =20 sec\u00b2\u03c6, y2\u00b2=24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6) =80 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +96 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nWe can express this in terms of sin\u03c6 or cos\u03c6.\n\nLet me express everything in terms of sin\u03c6. Let me denote t = sin\u03c6.\n\nThen, cos\u00b2\u03c6 =1 - t\u00b2.\n\nAlso, tan\u00b2\u03c6 = sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6 = t\u00b2/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, sec\u00b2\u03c6 =1/cos\u00b2\u03c6 =1/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80*(1/(1 - t\u00b2)) +96*(t\u00b2/(1 - t\u00b2)) = [80 +96 t\u00b2]/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= [80 +96 t\u00b2]/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nOur goal is to find the minimum of BD\u00b2, which is a function of t, given that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut we also have point A on the hyperbola, which is parametrized by \u03b8. So, we have to relate \u03b8 and \u03c6 through sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nLet me denote s = sin\u03b8, then sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = s t = -5/6.\n\nSo, s = (-5)/(6 t).\n\nBut we also have that point A is on the hyperbola, so its coordinates are (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8). But we need to ensure that these coordinates are real, so cos\u03b8 \u22600, which is already taken care of in the parametrization.\n\nBut perhaps we can relate \u03b8 and \u03c6 through the condition s t = -5/6.\n\nSo, s = (-5)/(6 t).\n\nBut s = sin\u03b8, and t = sin\u03c6.\n\nWe need to find the possible values of t such that both s and t satisfy their respective hyperbola conditions.\n\nWait, perhaps we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of t and then find its minimum.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= [80 +96 t\u00b2]/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = [80 +96 t\u00b2]/(1 - t\u00b2) = [80 +96 t\u00b2]/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 80 +96 t\u00b2 = 16*(5 +6 t\u00b2).\n\nDenominator: 1 - t\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=16*(5 +6 t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nWe need to find the minimum of BD\u00b2 with respect to t, given that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut we have s = (-5)/(6 t).\n\nBut s = sin\u03b8, so |s| \u22641. So, |(-5)/(6 t)| \u22641 \u2192 |5/(6 t)| \u22641 \u2192 |t| \u22655/6.\n\nSo, |t| \u22655/6. So, t \u2264 -5/6 or t \u22655/6.\n\nBut t = sin\u03c6, so t \u2208 [-1,1].\n\nSo, t \u2208 [-1, -5/6] \u222a [5/6, 1].\n\nTherefore, t can't be between (-5/6,5/6).\n\nSo, t must be in [-1, -5/6] or [5/6,1].\n\nNow, let's consider t in [5/6,1].\n\nWe can write BD\u00b2=16*(5 +6 t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nLet me denote f(t)= (5 +6 t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nWe can compute the derivative of f(t) with respect to t to find its extrema.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to make substitution.\n\nLet me let u = t\u00b2. Since t \u2208 [5/6,1], u \u2208 [25/36,1].\n\nSo, f(t)= (5 +6u)/(1 -u).\n\nSo, f(u)= (5 +6u)/(1 -u).\n\nCompute derivative f\u2019(u):\n\nf\u2019(u)= [ (6)(1 -u) - (5 +6u)(-1) ] / (1 -u)^2\n\n= [6(1 -u) +5 +6u ] / (1 -u)^2\n\n= [6 -6u +5 +6u ] / (1 -u)^2\n\n= (11)/(1 -u)^2.\n\nSince 1 -u >0 (because u \u22641), the derivative is positive. So, f(u) is increasing in u.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of f(u) occurs at the minimal u, which is u=25/36.\n\nSo, f(u) is minimized at u=25/36.\n\nSo, f_min= (5 +6*(25/36))/(1 -25/36).\n\nCompute numerator: 5 + (150/36)=5 + (25/6)= (30/6 +25/6)=55/6.\n\nDenominator: (11/36).\n\nSo, f_min= (55/6)/(11/36)= (55/6)*(36/11)= (55*6)/11= (5*6)/1=30.\n\nSo, f_min=30.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2=16*f(t) \u226516*30=480.\n\nWait, that's BD\u00b2=16*f(t), so minimal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nWait, but wait, t can also be in [-1, -5/6]. Let's check that case.\n\nIf t is negative, say t = -k where k \u2208 [5/6,1], then u = t\u00b2 =k\u00b2 \u2208 [25/36,1].\n\nSo, f(t)= (5 +6u)/(1 -u), same as before. So, regardless of t being positive or negative, the f(t) is same because it's a function of u. So, the minimal value is still 30, so BD\u00b2=16*30=480.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought BD\u00b2 was 4(r\u00b2 +s\u00b2), but now I have BD\u00b2=4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2)=4*(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6). Wait, in the parametrization, point B is (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6), so x2\u00b2=20 sec\u00b2\u03c6, y2\u00b2=24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nWait, but in the BD\u00b2 expression, I have 4*(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2)=4*(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6). So, that's 80 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +96 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut when I did the substitution, I set u = t\u00b2, where t=sin\u03c6. So, tan\u03c6 = sin\u03c6 / sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6)= t / sqrt(1 -t\u00b2). So, tan\u00b2\u03c6= t\u00b2/(1 -t\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, sec\u00b2\u03c6=1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6=1 + t\u00b2/(1 -t\u00b2)= (1 -t\u00b2 +t\u00b2)/(1 -t\u00b2)=1/(1 -t\u00b2).\n\nSo, 80 sec\u00b2\u03c6=80/(1 -t\u00b2), and 96 tan\u00b2\u03c6=96*(t\u00b2/(1 -t\u00b2)).\n\nSo, 80/(1 -t\u00b2) +96*(t\u00b2/(1 -t\u00b2))= (80 +96 t\u00b2)/(1 -t\u00b2), which is what I had earlier.\n\nSo, yes, f(t)= (80 +96 t\u00b2)/(1 -t\u00b2)=16*(5 +6t\u00b2)/(1 -t\u00b2).\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, with t \u2208 [5/6,1], the minimal value is 30, so BD\u00b2=16*30=480.\n\nWait, but is 480 the minimal BD\u00b2? So, the minimal value is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480, since BD\u00b2 cannot be less than 480.\n\nWait, but wait, let me verify. If t approaches 5/6 from above, then u approaches 25/36, so f(t) approaches 30, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nIf t approaches 1, then u approaches1, denominator approaches 0, so f(t) approaches infinity, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSimilarly, if t approaches -5/6, same thing, since u is t\u00b2.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480. But wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, then 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 \u2265480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. But wait, 480 is the minimal, so BD\u00b2 can't be less than 480. So, 480 is the infimum.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but not less than 480, then 480 is the infimum. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480. Because for any number greater than 480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 less than that number. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480, so 480 is the minimal value, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 \u2265480, so 480 is the lower bound, and it's attainable? Wait, is 480 attainable?\n\nWait, when t=5/6, does that correspond to a real point on the hyperbola?\n\nWait, t=5/6, so sin\u03c6=5/6. Then, cos\u03c6= sqrt(1 - (25/36))=sqrt(11/36)=sqrt(11)/6.\n\nSo, point B would be (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6).\n\nsec\u03c6=1/cos\u03c6=6/sqrt(11).\n\ntan\u03c6=sin\u03c6/cos\u03c6=(5/6)/(sqrt(11)/6)=5/sqrt(11).\n\nSo, point B is (sqrt(20)*(6/sqrt(11)), sqrt(24)*(5/sqrt(11))).\n\nSimplify:\n\nsqrt(20)=2*sqrt(5), so x-coordinate: 2*sqrt(5)*(6/sqrt(11))=12 sqrt(5/11).\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(24)=2*sqrt(6), so y-coordinate: 2*sqrt(6)*(5/sqrt(11))=10 sqrt(6/11).\n\nSo, point B is (12 sqrt(5/11),10 sqrt(6/11)).\n\nSimilarly, point A is (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8).\n\nBut we have s = sin\u03b8 = (-5)/(6 t) = (-5)/(6*(5/6))= -1.\n\nSo, sin\u03b8= -1, so \u03b8= -\u03c0/2.\n\nSo, cos\u03b8=0, which would make sec\u03b8 undefined. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, if sin\u03b8= -1, then cos\u03b8=0, so sec\u03b8 is undefined. That suggests that point A would be at (sqrt(20)*sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8) with sec\u03b8 undefined, which would mean x1 approaches infinity. So, point A would be at infinity, which is not possible.\n\nHmm, so perhaps t cannot be exactly 5/6 because that would require point A to be at infinity, which is not allowed. Therefore, t must be greater than 5/6, but not equal. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is approached as t approaches 5/6 from above, making BD\u00b2 approach 480, but never actually reaching it.\n\nTherefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, but it's not attained. So, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but always greater than 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, since BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is 480. Because for any number greater than 480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 less than that number, but since BD\u00b2 can't be less than 480, 480 is the lower bound.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis.\n\nThen, there are four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. Hmm, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.\n\nI need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, BD is one of the diagonals, and I need to find the supremum (the least upper bound) of BD\u00b2, but the answer should be the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all possible such rhombi. Wait, no, actually, I think I misread. It says the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, the infimum of BD\u00b2, but wait, no. Wait, the problem is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the largest number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all possible rhombi. So, m is the infimum of BD\u00b2, because it's the greatest lower bound. But wait, no, if m is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, then m should be the minimum of BD\u00b2. Wait, but the question says the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to some value from above, then m is that value. So, m is the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the minimum possible BD\u00b2, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to parametrize the problem.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, and they are perpendicular.\n\nLet me denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Let me denote points A and C as endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D as endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes, I can assume that the diagonals are along the coordinate axes or some lines through the origin.\n\nBut wait, the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes and the origin. So, if the rhombus is such that its diagonals are along the coordinate axes, then points A and C would be on one axis, and points B and D on the other. But in that case, the points would be on the hyperbola, but hyperbola doesn't intersect the coordinate axes except at infinity. Wait, but the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. So, when x=0, y\u00b2 = -24*(1), which is not possible. Similarly, when y=0, x\u00b2=20, so x=\u00b1\u221a20. So, the hyperbola only intersects the x-axis at (\u00b1\u221a20, 0), but not the y-axis. So, if a diagonal is along the y-axis, then points B and D would have x=0, which is impossible because the hyperbola doesn't have points there except at infinity.\n\nSo, that suggests that the diagonals can't be along the coordinate axes. Therefore, the diagonals must be along some other lines passing through the origin, but not aligned with the axes. So, perhaps the diagonals are symmetric with respect to the origin, but not along the axes.\n\nSo, let's denote the diagonals as vectors. Let me think of the diagonals as vectors. So, if AC and BD are the diagonals, then the coordinates of the points can be written in terms of vectors from the origin.\n\nSince the rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, each vertex can be represented as a vector from the origin. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, point B would be (u, v), and point D would be (-u, -v).\n\nSince all four points lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, and similarly for u and v.\n\nNow, because ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the lengths of AB, BC, CD, DA are equal.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, the vectors of the diagonals should satisfy certain conditions. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, and they are perpendicular. So, the dot product of vectors AC and BD should be zero.\n\nSo, the vector AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, vector BD is from B to D, which is (-2u, -2v). But wait, actually, AC is from A to C, which is ( -x -x, -y - y )? Wait, no, AC is from A to C, which is (C - A). So, C is (-x, -y), so AC is (-x -x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is D - B = (-u - u, -v - v) = (-2u, -2v). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if B is (u, v), then D is (-u, -v). So, BD is D - B = (-u - u, -v - v) = (-2u, -2v). So, the vectors of the diagonals AC and BD are (-2x, -2y) and (-2u, -2v). Since the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, (-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 0 \u2192 4xu + 4yv = 0 \u2192 xu + yv = 0.\n\nSo, the condition is xu + yv = 0. So, that's one condition.\n\nAnother condition is that all four points lie on the hyperbola. So, for points A and C: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 and same for B and D: u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nNow, I need to find BD\u00b2. So, BD is the diagonal from B to D. The length of BD is the distance between B and D. Since B is (u, v) and D is (-u, -v), the distance between them is sqrt[( -u - u )\u00b2 + ( -v - v )\u00b2] = sqrt[(-2u)\u00b2 + (-2v)^2] = sqrt[4u\u00b2 +4v\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2). Therefore, BD\u00b2 = (2*sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). So, I need to find the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2, which would be 4 times the infimum of (u\u00b2 +v\u00b2). Wait, but wait, the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2. Because if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily small, then the infimum is zero, but perhaps it's bounded below by some positive number.\n\nBut wait, since the points B and D lie on the hyperbola, u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 =1. So, u\u00b2 = 20(1 + v\u00b2/24). So, u\u00b2 = 20 + (20/24)v\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6)v\u00b2. So, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6)v\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = 20 + (11/6)v\u00b2. So, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = 20 + (11/6)v\u00b2. Since v\u00b2 is non-negative, the minimum of u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 is 20, achieved when v=0. But wait, if v=0, then from the hyperbola equation, u\u00b2=20*(1) =20, so u=\u00b1\u221a20. So, points B and D would be (\u221a20,0) and (-\u221a20,0). But then, the other diagonal AC would have points A and C. Wait, but if points B and D are on the x-axis, then points A and C must be on the hyperbola as well.\n\nWait, but if we have points A and C on the hyperbola, then their coordinates must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. So, if points A and C are (x, y) and (-x, -y), then the diagonal AC has length 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), and the diagonal BD has length 2*sqrt(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2). But wait, in this case, if v=0, then u=\u00b1\u221a20, so BD\u00b2=4*(20 +0)=80.\n\nBut wait, if v=0, then from the condition xu + yv=0, we have x*u + y*0 =0 \u2192 x*u=0. So, since u=\u221a20 or -\u221a20, which is non-zero, then x must be zero. But if x=0, then from the hyperbola equation, 0 - y\u00b2/24=1 \u2192 y\u00b2= -24, which is impossible. So, this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, v cannot be zero, because that would require x=0, which is impossible on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 cannot be 80, because that would require points B and D to be on the x-axis, which is impossible due to the hyperbola's shape.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is greater than 80. Hmm, wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because when v approaches zero, u approaches \u221a20, but x must approach zero, which is impossible because then y would have to be imaginary. So, perhaps BD\u00b2 cannot be less than a certain value.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let me consider the two diagonals AC and BD as vectors. Let me denote vector AC as (p, q), so points A and C are (p/2, q/2) and (-p/2, -q/2). Similarly, vector BD is (r, s), so points B and D are (r/2, s/2) and (-r/2, -s/2).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, the sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, etc.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the properties of the rhombus. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the dot product of AC and BD is zero: (p, q)\u00b7(r, s) = pr + qs =0.\n\nAlso, all four points lie on the hyperbola, so for point A: (p/2)^2 /20 - (q/2)^2 /24 =1 \u2192 p\u00b2/(4*20) - q\u00b2/(4*24) =1 \u2192 p\u00b2/(80) - q\u00b2/(96) =1.\n\nSimilarly, for point B: (r/2)^2 /20 - (s/2)^2 /24 =1 \u2192 r\u00b2/(80) - s\u00b2/(96) =1.\n\nSo, both points A and B lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/80 - y\u00b2/96 =1, which is a scaled-down version of the original hyperbola.\n\nSo, we have two points (p/2, q/2) and (r/2, s/2) on the hyperbola x\u00b2/80 - y\u00b2/96 =1.\n\nAdditionally, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular, so pr + qs=0.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2. BD is the distance between B and D, which is sqrt[(r - (-r))\u00b2 + (s - (-s))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2r)^2 + (2s)^2] = 2*sqrt(r\u00b2 +s\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 =4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2).\n\nSo, our goal is to minimize BD\u00b2=4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2) subject to the conditions that (r\u00b2)/80 - (s\u00b2)/96 =1 and pr + qs=0.\n\nWait, but we have another condition from the rhombus: the sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, etc.\n\nAlternatively, since the rhombus can be considered as a parallelogram with equal sides, we can use the fact that the sides are equal vectors.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to consider the coordinates of the rhombus.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin. Let\u2019s denote point A as (x1, y1), point C as (-x1, -y1), point B as (x2, y2), and point D as (-x2, -y2).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nSo, the distance AB should equal the distance BC.\n\nDistance AB: sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2].\n\nDistance BC: sqrt[(-x1 - x2)^2 + (-y1 - y2)^2].\n\nSo, AB\u00b2 = (x2 -x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2.\n\nBC\u00b2 = (-x1 -x2)^2 + (-y1 - y2)^2 = (x1 +x2)^2 + (y1 + y2)^2.\n\nSince AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2,\n\n(x2 -x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 = (x1 +x2)^2 + (y1 + y2)^2.\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: x2\u00b2 - 2x1x2 +x1\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 - 2y1y2 + y1\u00b2.\n\nRight side: x1\u00b2 + 2x1x2 +x2\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 + 2y1y2 + y2\u00b2.\n\nSubtracting left side from right side:\n\n[ x1\u00b2 + 2x1x2 +x2\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 + 2y1y2 + y2\u00b2 ] - [ x2\u00b2 - 2x1x2 +x1\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 - 2y1y2 + y1\u00b2 ] = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n( x1\u00b2 + 2x1x2 +x2\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 + 2y1y2 + y2\u00b2 ) - ( x2\u00b2 - 2x1x2 +x1\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 - 2y1y2 + y1\u00b2 ) \n\n= 2x1x2 + 2y1y2 - (-2x1x2) - (-2y1y2)\n\nWait, no, let me compute term by term.\n\nx1\u00b2 cancels with -x1\u00b2.\n\nx2\u00b2 cancels with -x2\u00b2.\n\ny1\u00b2 cancels with -y1\u00b2.\n\ny2\u00b2 cancels with -y2\u00b2.\n\nSo, what remains is 2x1x2 + 2y1y2 - (-2x1x2) - (-2y1y2). Wait, no:\n\nWait, the right side has +2x1x2 and +2y1y2, and the left side has -2x1x2 and -2y1y2.\n\nWait, actually, let me write it as:\n\nRight side - left side:\n\n(2x1x2 + 2y1y2) - (-2x1x2 - 2y1y2) = 4x1x2 +4y1y2.\n\nSo, 4x1x2 +4y1y2 =0 \u2192 x1x2 + y1y2 =0.\n\nSo, we have another condition: x1x2 + y1y2 =0.\n\nEarlier, we had from the diagonals being perpendicular: pr + qs=0, which in this case, since pr corresponds to x1x2 and qs corresponds to y1y2, so it's the same condition: x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nSo, to recap, the conditions are:\n\n1. Points A and C: x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 =1.\n\n2. Points B and D: x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 =1.\n\n3. Diagonals are perpendicular: x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nWe need to find the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nSo, our goal is to minimize 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2) given that x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 =1 and x1x2 + y1y2=0, with x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit involved. Maybe we can parameterize the points.\n\nLet me parametrize point A as (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8). Because for hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2=1, a parametrization is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, point B can be parametrized as (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6).\n\nThen, the condition x1x2 + y1y2=0 becomes:\n\nsqrt(20) sec\u03b8 * sqrt(20) sec\u03c6 + sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 * sqrt(24) tan\u03c6 =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0.\n\nSo, 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 = -24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6.\n\nDivide both sides by sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 (assuming they are non-zero, which they are because sec\u03b8 and sec\u03c6 are at least 1 or less than -1).\n\n20 = -24 (sin\u03b8 / cos\u03b8)(sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6) / (1/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6)) )\n\nWait, maybe it's better to write tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = (sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8)(sin\u03c6/cos\u03c6) = (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6).\n\nSo, 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0 \u2192 20/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) +24 (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6:\n\n20 +24 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6=0 \u2192 24 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -20 \u2192 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -20/24 = -5/6.\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, that's one equation.\n\nNow, we can express BD\u00b2 as 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2) =4[20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6].\n\nWait, because x2\u00b2 =20 sec\u00b2\u03c6, y2\u00b2=24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6) =80 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +96 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nWe can express this in terms of sin\u03c6 or cos\u03c6.\n\nLet me express everything in terms of sin\u03c6. Let me denote t = sin\u03c6.\n\nThen, cos\u00b2\u03c6 =1 - t\u00b2.\n\nAlso, tan\u00b2\u03c6 = sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6 = t\u00b2/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, sec\u00b2\u03c6 =1/cos\u00b2\u03c6 =1/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80*(1/(1 - t\u00b2)) +96*(t\u00b2/(1 - t\u00b2)) = [80 +96 t\u00b2]/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= [80 +96 t\u00b2]/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nOur goal is to find the minimum of BD\u00b2, which is a function of t, given that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut we also have point A on the hyperbola, which is parametrized by \u03b8. So, we have to relate \u03b8 and \u03c6 through sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nLet me denote s = sin\u03b8, then sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = s t = -5/6.\n\nSo, s = (-5)/(6 t).\n\nBut we also have that point A is on the hyperbola, so its coordinates are (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8). But we need to ensure that these coordinates are real, so cos\u03b8 \u22600, which is already taken care of in the parametrization.\n\nBut perhaps we can relate \u03b8 and \u03c6 through the condition s t = -5/6.\n\nSo, s = (-5)/(6 t).\n\nBut s = sin\u03b8, and t = sin\u03c6.\n\nWe need to find the possible values of t such that both s and t satisfy their respective hyperbola conditions.\n\nWait, perhaps we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of t and then find its minimum.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= [80 +96 t\u00b2]/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = [80 +96 t\u00b2]/(1 - t\u00b2) = [80 +96 t\u00b2]/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 80 +96 t\u00b2 = 16*(5 +6 t\u00b2).\n\nDenominator: 1 - t\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=16*(5 +6 t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nWe need to find the minimum of BD\u00b2 with respect to t, given that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut we have s = (-5)/(6 t).\n\nBut s = sin\u03b8, so |s| \u22641. So, |(-5)/(6 t)| \u22641 \u2192 |5/(6 t)| \u22641 \u2192 |t| \u22655/6.\n\nSo, |t| \u22655/6. So, t \u2264 -5/6 or t \u22655/6.\n\nBut t = sin\u03c6, so t \u2208 [-1,1].\n\nSo, t \u2208 [-1, -5/6] \u222a [5/6, 1].\n\nTherefore, t can't be between (-5/6,5/6).\n\nSo, t must be in [-1, -5/6] or [5/6,1].\n\nNow, let's consider t in [5/6,1].\n\nWe can write BD\u00b2=16*(5 +6 t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nLet me denote f(t)= (5 +6 t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nWe can compute the derivative of f(t) with respect to t to find its extrema.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to make substitution.\n\nLet me let u = t\u00b2. Since t \u2208 [5/6,1], u \u2208 [25/36,1].\n\nSo, f(t)= (5 +6u)/(1 -u).\n\nSo, f(u)= (5 +6u)/(1 -u).\n\nCompute derivative f\u2019(u):\n\nf\u2019(u)= [ (6)(1 -u) - (5 +6u)(-1) ] / (1 -u)^2\n\n= [6(1 -u) +5 +6u ] / (1 -u)^2\n\n= [6 -6u +5 +6u ] / (1 -u)^2\n\n= (11)/(1 -u)^2.\n\nSince 1 -u >0 (because u \u22641), the derivative is positive. So, f(u) is increasing in u.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of f(u) occurs at the minimal u, which is u=25/36.\n\nSo, f(u) is minimized at u=25/36.\n\nSo, f_min= (5 +6*(25/36))/(1 -25/36).\n\nCompute numerator: 5 + (150/36)=5 + (25/6)= (30/6 +25/6)=55/6.\n\nDenominator: (11/36).\n\nSo, f_min= (55/6)/(11/36)= (55/6)*(36/11)= (55*6)/11= (5*6)/1=30.\n\nSo, f_min=30.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2=16*f(t) \u226516*30=480.\n\nWait, that's BD\u00b2=16*f(t), so minimal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nWait, but wait, t can also be in [-1, -5/6]. Let's check that case.\n\nIf t is negative, say t = -k where k \u2208 [5/6,1], then u = t\u00b2 =k\u00b2 \u2208 [25/36,1].\n\nSo, f(t)= (5 +6u)/(1 -u), same as before. So, regardless of t being positive or negative, the f(t) is same because it's a function of u. So, the minimal value is still 30, so BD\u00b2=16*30=480.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought BD\u00b2 was 4(r\u00b2 +s\u00b2), but now I have BD\u00b2=4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2)=4*(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6). Wait, in the parametrization, point B is (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6), so x2\u00b2=20 sec\u00b2\u03c6, y2\u00b2=24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nWait, but in the BD\u00b2 expression, I have 4*(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2)=4*(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6). So, that's 80 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +96 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut when I did the substitution, I set u = t\u00b2, where t=sin\u03c6. So, tan\u03c6 = sin\u03c6 / sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6)= t / sqrt(1 -t\u00b2). So, tan\u00b2\u03c6= t\u00b2/(1 -t\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, sec\u00b2\u03c6=1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6=1 + t\u00b2/(1 -t\u00b2)= (1 -t\u00b2 +t\u00b2)/(1 -t\u00b2)=1/(1 -t\u00b2).\n\nSo, 80 sec\u00b2\u03c6=80/(1 -t\u00b2), and 96 tan\u00b2\u03c6=96*(t\u00b2/(1 -t\u00b2)).\n\nSo, 80/(1 -t\u00b2) +96*(t\u00b2/(1 -t\u00b2))= (80 +96 t\u00b2)/(1 -t\u00b2), which is what I had earlier.\n\nSo, yes, f(t)= (80 +96 t\u00b2)/(1 -t\u00b2)=16*(5 +6t\u00b2)/(1 -t\u00b2).\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, with t \u2208 [5/6,1], the minimal value is 30, so BD\u00b2=16*30=480.\n\nWait, but is 480 the minimal BD\u00b2? So, the minimal value is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480, since BD\u00b2 cannot be less than 480.\n\nWait, but wait, let me verify. If t approaches 5/6 from above, then u approaches 25/36, so f(t) approaches 30, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nIf t approaches 1, then u approaches1, denominator approaches 0, so f(t) approaches infinity, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSimilarly, if t approaches -5/6, same thing, since u is t\u00b2.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480. But wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, then 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 \u2265480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. But wait, 480 is the minimal, so BD\u00b2 can't be less than 480. So, 480 is the infimum.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but not less than 480, then 480 is the infimum. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480. Because for any number greater than 480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 less than that number. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480, so 480 is the minimal value, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 \u2265480, so 480 is the lower bound, and it's attainable? Wait, is 480 attainable?\n\nWait, when t=5/6, does that correspond to a real point on the hyperbola?\n\nWait, t=5/6, so sin\u03c6=5/6. Then, cos\u03c6= sqrt(1 - (25/36))=sqrt(11/36)=sqrt(11)/6.\n\nSo, point B would be (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6).\n\nsec\u03c6=1/cos\u03c6=6/sqrt(11).\n\ntan\u03c6=sin\u03c6/cos\u03c6=(5/6)/(sqrt(11)/6)=5/sqrt(11).\n\nSo, point B is (sqrt(20)*(6/sqrt(11)), sqrt(24)*(5/sqrt(11))).\n\nSimplify:\n\nsqrt(20)=2*sqrt(5), so x-coordinate: 2*sqrt(5)*(6/sqrt(11))=12 sqrt(5/11).\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(24)=2*sqrt(6), so y-coordinate: 2*sqrt(6)*(5/sqrt(11))=10 sqrt(6/11).\n\nSo, point B is (12 sqrt(5/11),10 sqrt(6/11)).\n\nSimilarly, point A is (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8).\n\nBut we have s = sin\u03b8 = (-5)/(6 t) = (-5)/(6*(5/6))= -1.\n\nSo, sin\u03b8= -1, so \u03b8= -\u03c0/2.\n\nSo, cos\u03b8=0, which would make sec\u03b8 undefined. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, if sin\u03b8= -1, then cos\u03b8=0, so sec\u03b8 is undefined. That suggests that point A would be at (sqrt(20)*sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8) with sec\u03b8 undefined, which would mean x1 approaches infinity. So, point A would be at infinity, which is not possible.\n\nHmm, so perhaps t cannot be exactly 5/6 because that would require point A to be at infinity, which is not allowed. Therefore, t must be greater than 5/6, but not equal. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is approached as t approaches 5/6 from above, making BD\u00b2 approach 480, but never actually reaching it.\n\nTherefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, but it's not attained. So, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but always greater than 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, since BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is 480. Because for any number greater than 480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 less than that number, but since BD\u00b2 can't be less than 480, 480 is the lower bound.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we consider the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\) and the rhombus \\(ABCD\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other at the origin.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem about a rhombus on a hyperbola. The hyperbola equation is given as x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. There are four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Yeah, that's right. So, each diagonal is perpendicular to the other, and they intersect at their midpoints. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, that must be the midpoint for both diagonals.\n\nSo, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. Therefore, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y) because the origin is the midpoint. Similarly, if B is (a, b), then D is (-a, -b). So, all four points are A(x, y), B(a, b), C(-x, -y), D(-a, -b).\n\nSince all four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, each of these points must satisfy that equation. So, plugging A into the hyperbola equation, we have x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. Similarly, for B, a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1. Same for C and D, but since they are just the negatives, the equations are the same as A and B.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.\n\nWait, but maybe instead of working with distances, it's easier to use the property that the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular. Since AC is from A(x, y) to C(-x, -y), the vector AC is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from B(a, b) to D(-a, -b), so the vector BD is (-2a, -2b).\n\nWait, but actually, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, vectors AC would be C - A = (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD would be D - B = (-a - a, -b - b) = (-2a, -2b). But for the diagonals to be perpendicular, their dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, AC \u00b7 BD = (-2x)(-2a) + (-2y)(-2b) = 4xa + 4yb = 0. Therefore, xa + yb = 0. That's an important equation.\n\nSo, we have two points A(x, y) and B(a, b) on the hyperbola, and their coordinates satisfy xa + yb = 0.\n\nNow, since it's a rhombus, the sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, which is equal to the distance from C to D, and so on. But maybe another way to think about it is that the vectors AB and AD are equal in length and the angle between them is such that the figure is a rhombus.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the slopes. Since the sides are equal and the diagonals are perpendicular, maybe we can use some parametrization.\n\nWait, let me think about parametrizing the hyperbola. For hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a parametrization can be done using hyperbolic functions: x = a cosh \u03b8, y = b sinh \u03b8. Alternatively, since hyperbola can also be parametrized as x = a sec t, y = b tan t, but that's for right-opening hyperbola.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the easiest way here. Alternatively, since points A and C are opposites through the origin, and B and D are opposites, maybe I can represent A and B in terms of some parameters.\n\nLet me think: Let\u2019s denote A as (x, y), so C is (-x, -y). Similarly, B is (a, b), D is (-a, -b). Since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are equal. So, the distance AB equals BC.\n\nBut calculating distances might get messy, but maybe I can use vectors. The vector AB is (a - x, b - y). The vector BC is (-x - a, -y - b). The lengths of these vectors must be equal. So,\n\n\u221a[(a - x)\u00b2 + (b - y)\u00b2] = \u221a[(-x - a)\u00b2 + (-y - b)\u00b2]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(a - x)\u00b2 + (b - y)\u00b2 = ( -x - a )\u00b2 + ( -y - b )\u00b2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: (a\u00b2 - 2ax + x\u00b2) + (b\u00b2 - 2by + y\u00b2)\nRight side: (x\u00b2 + 2ax + a\u00b2) + (y\u00b2 + 2by + b\u00b2)\n\nSubtracting left from right:\n\n[ x\u00b2 + 2ax + a\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2by + b\u00b2 ] - [ a\u00b2 - 2ax + x\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2by + y\u00b2 ] = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n( x\u00b2 + 2ax + a\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2by + b\u00b2 ) - a\u00b2 + 2ax - x\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + 2by - y\u00b2 = 0\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy. Let me compute term by term.\n\nLeft side: a\u00b2 - 2ax + x\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2by + y\u00b2\nRight side: a\u00b2 + 2ax + x\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2by + y\u00b2\n\nSubtracting left from right:\n\n(a\u00b2 + 2ax + x\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2by + y\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 - 2ax + x\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2by + y\u00b2) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(a\u00b2 - a\u00b2) + (2ax + 2ax) + (x\u00b2 - x\u00b2) + (b\u00b2 - b\u00b2) + (2by + 2by) + (y\u00b2 - y\u00b2) = 0\n\nSo, 4ax + 4by = 0.\n\nWhich gives ax + by = 0.\n\nWait, but earlier we had from the diagonals being perpendicular, xa + yb = 0. So, that's the same equation. So, that condition is necessary for the sides AB and BC to be equal.\n\nTherefore, the two conditions we have so far are:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 (since A is on hyperbola)\n2. a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1 (since B is on hyperbola)\n3. xa + yb = 0 (from the diagonals being perpendicular or sides being equal)\n\nSo, we have three equations.\n\nNow, since we need to find BD\u00b2, let's figure out what BD is. BD is the distance between points B(a, b) and D(-a, -b). So, BD is the distance between (a, b) and (-a, -b). The distance squared is (2a)^2 + (2b)^2 = 4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2. So, BD\u00b2 = 4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2.\n\nBut we need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, and then take the greatest number less than that. Wait, no, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is at least some number, so the greatest lower bound is the infimum.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, and then the answer would be that minimum, but since it's the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, perhaps it's the infimum.\n\nWait, actually, if BD\u00b2 can take a minimum value, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be that minimum. But maybe BD\u00b2 can't actually reach that minimum, so it's the infimum.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should proceed by trying to express BD\u00b2 in terms of some variables and then find its minimum.\n\nWe have BD\u00b2 = 4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So, we need to minimize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2, subject to a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1 and xa + yb = 0, where x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nWait, but we also have the condition xa + yb =0. So, we have to link these variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize points A and B.\n\nLet me think about parametrizing points A and B on the hyperbola. Since the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, I can write points on the hyperbola in terms of a parameter.\n\nOne standard parametrization for hyperbola is using hyperbolic functions: x = a cosh \u03b8, y = b sinh \u03b8, where a\u00b2 = 20, b\u00b2=24. So, a = 2\u221a5, b=2\u221a6.\n\nSo, let me define point A as (2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8). Then, point C is (-2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8, -2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, point B can be parametrized as (2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6), and point D is (-2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6, -2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6).\n\nBut then, the condition xa + yb =0 must be satisfied. Let's compute that:\n\nx = 2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8, a = 2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6\ny = 2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8, b = 2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6\n\nSo, xa + yb = (2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8)(2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6) + (2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8)(2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6) = 0\n\nCompute this:\n\n(2\u221a5)(2\u221a5) cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + (2\u221a6)(2\u221a6) sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(4*5) cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + (4*6) sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0\n20 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 24 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0\n\nHmm, this seems manageable. Let me write this as:\n\n5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 = -6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6\n\nDivide both sides by cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 (assuming they are non-zero, which they are because cosh is always \u22651):\n\n5 = -6 (sinh \u03b8 / cosh \u03b8) (sinh \u03c6 / cosh \u03c6)\n\nBut sinh t / cosh t = tanh t, so:\n\n5 = -6 tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6\n\nSo,\n\ntanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6 = -5/6\n\nHmm, so the product of the hyperbolic tangents is -5/6.\n\nThat's an interesting condition. So, \u03b8 and \u03c6 are related through this equation.\n\nNow, our goal is to find BD\u00b2, which is 4a\u00b2 +4b\u00b2. Since a and b are the coordinates of point B, which is (2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6), so a = 2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6, b = 2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = 20 cosh\u00b2 \u03c6, b\u00b2 = 24 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2 = 4*(20 cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6) = 4*(20 cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6)\n\nSimplify:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 80 cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 + 96 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe we can express this in terms of hyperbolic identities.\n\nWe know that cosh\u00b2 t - sinh\u00b2 t =1, so maybe express cosh\u00b2 in terms of sinh\u00b2.\n\ncosh\u00b2 \u03c6 = 1 + sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSubstitute into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 80*(1 + sinh\u00b2 \u03c6) + 96 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 = 80 + 80 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 + 96 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 = 80 + 176 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nWe need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2, so we need to minimize 80 + 176 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSince sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 is always non-negative, the minimum occurs when sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 is as small as possible. The minimum value of sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 is 0, which occurs when \u03c6=0.\n\nBut wait, let's see. If sinh \u03c6 =0, then \u03c6=0, so tanh \u03c6=0. Then, from the earlier equation tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6 = -5/6, tanh \u03b8 * 0 = -5/6, which would imply 0 = -5/6, which is impossible. So, sinh \u03c6 cannot be zero.\n\nSo, sinh \u03c6 cannot be zero, which means \u03c6 cannot be zero. Therefore, sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 must be positive. So, the minimum of BD\u00b2 would occur when sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 is as small as possible, but not zero.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can express sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 in terms of tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6.\n\nFrom the earlier equation, tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nLet me denote tanh \u03b8 = t, tanh \u03c6 = s. So, t*s = -5/6.\n\nWe also have:\n\nFrom BD\u00b2 =80 +176 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nExpress sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 in terms of s:\n\nsinh\u00b2 \u03c6 = (tanh\u00b2 \u03c6)/(1 - tanh\u00b2 \u03c6) = s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2)\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =80 +176*(s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2)).\n\nBut we have t*s = -5/6, and t = tanh \u03b8, s = tanh \u03c6.\n\nBut we can express t in terms of s or vice versa.\n\nFrom t*s = -5/6, t = (-5)/(6s).\n\nSo, let's express BD\u00b2 in terms of s.\n\nBD\u00b2 =80 + 176*(s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2)).\n\nBut we also need to ensure that |s| <1, since tanh \u03c6 is between -1 and 1.\n\nMoreover, since t*s = -5/6, and t must be between -1 and 1, s must satisfy |s| >=5/6, because |t*s| =5/6, and |t| <=1, so |s| >=5/6.\n\nSo, s is in (-1, -5/6] union [5/6, 1).\n\nSo, s\u00b2 >=25/36.\n\nSo, let's set s\u00b2 = k, where k >=25/36.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2 =80 +176*(k/(1 -k)).\n\nLet me write that as:\n\nBD\u00b2 =80 +176*(k/(1 -k)) =80 + 176k/(1 -k)\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 =80 +176k/(1 -k) =80 + [176/(1 -k)] *k\n\nBut 1 -k = 1 -s\u00b2 = (1 -s)(1 +s), but not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let's write BD\u00b2 as a function of k:\n\nf(k) =80 + (176k)/(1 -k)\n\nWe need to find the minimum of f(k) for k >=25/36.\n\nTo find the minimum, take the derivative of f(k) with respect to k:\n\nf'(k) = 176*( (1 -k) - (-1)*k )/(1 -k)^2 ) = 176*(1 -k +k)/(1 -k)^2 = 176/(1 -k)^2\n\nWhich is positive for all k <1. So, f(k) is increasing on the interval k <1.\n\nTherefore, the minimum of f(k) occurs at the smallest possible k, which is k=25/36.\n\nSo, plugging k=25/36 into f(k):\n\nf(25/36) =80 + (176*(25/36))/(1 -25/36)\n\nCompute denominator first: 1 -25/36=11/36.\n\nSo,\n\nf(25/36)=80 + (176*(25/36))/(11/36) =80 + (176*(25/36)) * (36/11) )\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe 36 cancels out, so:\n\n80 + (176*25)/11\n\nCompute 176/11=16, so 16*25=400.\n\nSo,\n\nf(25/36)=80 +400=480.\n\nTherefore, the minimum BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that when sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 is minimized, which would be when \u03c6 is as close to zero as possible, but that would make s=tanh \u03c6 approach zero, but due to the condition t*s =-5/6, s cannot approach zero. So, the minimum BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. If BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, but perhaps it can't actually reach 480, so the infimum is 480, but BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480.\n\nWait, but in our parametrization, when k=25/36, s\u00b2=25/36, so s=\u00b15/6. Then, t = (-5)/(6s) = (-5)/(6*(\u00b15/6)) = (-5)/(\u00b15)=\u22131.\n\nSo, tanh \u03b8=\u22131, which implies \u03b8=\u00b1arctanh(1). Wait, but arctanh(1) is infinity because tanh approaches 1 asymptotically. So, \u03b8 approaches infinity, making cosh \u03b8 and sinh \u03b8 approach infinity as well.\n\nWait, hold on. If \u03b8 approaches infinity, then point A is (2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8), which goes to infinity. Similarly, point B is (2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6), but when s=5/6, tanh \u03c6=5/6, which is a finite value, so \u03c6 is finite. Therefore, point B is finite.\n\nBut then, as \u03b8 approaches infinity, point A goes to infinity, but the rhombus would still have to satisfy the condition that diagonals intersect at the origin. But if A is at infinity, then C is at negative infinity, so the rhombus would be very large. But BD\u00b2 would be 480, which is the minimal value, but in reality, when \u03b8 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that when k=25/36, we can achieve BD\u00b2=480. Because when s=5/6, tanh \u03c6=5/6, which is a finite \u03c6, but tanh \u03b8= -1/( (5/6)/s )? Wait, no, tanh \u03b8 = (-5)/(6s). If s=5/6, tanh \u03b8= (-5)/(6*(5/6))= (-5)/5 = -1. So, tanh \u03b8= -1, which implies \u03b8 approaches negative infinity.\n\nBut hyperbolic functions: tanh \u03b8 approaches 1 as \u03b8 approaches positive infinity and approaches -1 as \u03b8 approaches negative infinity. So, \u03b8 approaches negative infinity, making cosh \u03b8 and sinh \u03b8 go to infinity as well. So, point A is still at infinity, but point B is finite.\n\nWait, but if point A is at infinity, then the rhombus ABCD would have points at infinity, which isn't really a \"rhombus\" in the usual sense, but in the projective plane, perhaps. But maybe in this problem, such configurations are allowed.\n\nBut then, BD\u00b2 can approach 480, but can it actually reach 480? Because when \u03b8 approaches negative infinity, point A approaches negative infinity, but BD\u00b2 is approaching 480.\n\nWait, but if we can achieve BD\u00b2=480, then 480 is attainable, but in reality, when \u03b8 approaches negative infinity, the coordinates of A go to infinity, but point B is finite.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute BD\u00b2 when s=5/6.\n\nIf s=5/6, then tanh \u03c6=5/6, so sinh \u03c6 = (5/6)/(sqrt(1 - (25/36))) )= (5/6)/sqrt(11/36)= (5/6)/(sqrt(11)/6)=5/sqrt(11).\n\nSimilarly, cosh \u03c6= sqrt(1 + sinh\u00b2 \u03c6)=sqrt(1 +25/11)=sqrt(36/11)=6/sqrt(11).\n\nSo, point B is (2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6)= (2\u221a5*(6/sqrt(11)), 2\u221a6*(5/sqrt(11)) )\n\nCompute that:\n\nx-coordinate: 2\u221a5*(6)/sqrt(11)=12\u221a5 / sqrt(11)\ny-coordinate: 2\u221a6*(5)/sqrt(11)=10\u221a6 / sqrt(11)\n\nSo, a=12\u221a5 / sqrt(11), b=10\u221a6 / sqrt(11)\n\nCompute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2= (144 *5)/11=720/11\nb\u00b2= (100 *6)/11=600/11\nSo, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2= (720 +600)/11=1320/11=120\n\nThus, BD\u00b2=4*(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2)=4*120=480.\n\nWait, so when s=5/6, BD\u00b2=480. But earlier, I thought that when s=5/6, \u03b8 approaches negative infinity, but in reality, when s=5/6, tanh \u03b8= -1, which is \u03b8 approaching negative infinity, but in this case, point B is finite, and point A is (2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8), with \u03b8 approaching negative infinity.\n\nBut as \u03b8 approaches negative infinity, cosh \u03b8 approaches infinity, sinh \u03b8 approaches negative infinity. So, point A approaches (\u00b1infinity, -infinity), but in our case, tanh \u03b8= -1, which is \u03b8 approaching negative infinity, so sinh \u03b8 approaches -infinity, and cosh \u03b8 approaches +infinity.\n\nWait, but in that case, point A would be (2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8) = (something very large positive, something very large negative). But for point A to be on the hyperbola, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1, so as x increases, y must also increase to satisfy the equation, but in this case, y is negative and large in magnitude. So, as \u03b8 approaches negative infinity, point A approaches (positive infinity, negative infinity), which is consistent with the hyperbola.\n\nBut in this case, point B is finite, and BD\u00b2=480. So, it seems that BD\u00b2 can actually reach 480 when point B is at (12\u221a5 / sqrt(11), 10\u221a6 / sqrt(11)).\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 480, which is attainable. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, since BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" If BD\u00b2 can be 480, then 480 is attainable, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, but since 480 is attainable, the infimum is 480, and thus the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Wait, no. Wait, if BD\u00b2 can be 480, then for that particular rhombus, BD\u00b2=480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi must be less than or equal to 480. But since 480 is attainable, the infimum is 480, and thus any number less than 480 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, then 480 is the minimum. Therefore, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is \u2265480. So, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, but since 480 is attainable, the infimum is 480. Therefore, the answer would be 480.\n\nWait, but hold on. Suppose BD\u00b2 can be 480, but can it be lower? If 480 is the minimum, then no, it can't be lower. So, 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 is at least 480, so 480 is the infimum. But since 480 is attainable, it's actually the minimum. So, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but in our earlier calculation, when s=5/6, we get BD\u00b2=480, which is attainable. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Because for that rhombus, BD\u00b2=480, so any number greater than 480 would not satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But since 480 is attainable, the infimum is 480, so the answer is 480.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, it's like the supremum of lower bounds of BD\u00b2. Since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, then 480 is the infimum. So, any number less than 480 would not be the greatest lower bound. But since 480 is attainable, it is the infimum and also the minimum.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, and 480 is achieved by at least one rhombus. So, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if 480 is attainable, then for that rhombus, BD\u00b2=480, so any number less than 480 would be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but 480 itself is not less than BD\u00b2 for that particular rhombus. Therefore, the greatest such number is the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, which would be 480, because BD\u00b2 is always at least 480. So, 480 is the infimum, and the answer is 480.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is \u2265480, then 480 is the greatest lower bound. So, the answer is 480.\n\nBut wait, no. Because 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 for every rhombus. Since BD\u00b2 can be 480, which is the minimal value, the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because for every \u03b5>0, 480 - \u03b5 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but 480 itself is not less than BD\u00b2 for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480, but since 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for that rhombus, perhaps the answer is 480, but in the context of the problem, maybe 480 is the correct answer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, but in reality, BD\u00b2 can't be exactly 480 because that would require point A to be at infinity, which isn't allowed. But in our earlier calculation, when s=5/6, point B is finite, and point A is at (2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8) where \u03b8 approaches negative infinity, making point A approach infinity. So, technically, such a rhombus would have one vertex at infinity, which is not really a rhombus in the traditional sense. Therefore, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but never actually reach it. Therefore, the infimum is 480, but it's not attained. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480.\n\nWait, but how does that work? If BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, then 480 is the infimum, but not the minimum. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, but can get as close as we like to 480. So, 480 is the infimum, and thus the answer is 480.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused about whether 480 is attainable or not. Let me recap:\n\nWhen we set s=5/6, which is allowed because |s|=5/6 <1, then point B is finite, and point A is at (2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8) with \u03b8 approaching negative infinity. So, point A is at infinity, but in projective geometry, points at infinity are allowed. So, depending on the context, this might be acceptable.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it says \"points on the hyperbola,\" and points at infinity are not technically on the hyperbola in the affine plane. So, perhaps such a configuration isn't allowed, and therefore, BD\u00b2 can approach 480 but never actually reach it. So, the infimum is 480, but it's not attained, meaning BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem about a rhombus on a hyperbola. The hyperbola equation is given as x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. There are four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Yeah, that's right. So, each diagonal is perpendicular to the other, and they intersect at their midpoints. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, that must be the midpoint for both diagonals.\n\nSo, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. Therefore, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y) because the origin is the midpoint. Similarly, if B is (a, b), then D is (-a, -b). So, all four points are A(x, y), B(a, b), C(-x, -y), D(-a, -b).\n\nSince all four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, each of these points must satisfy that equation. So, plugging A into the hyperbola equation, we have x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. Similarly, for B, a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1. Same for C and D, but since they are just the negatives, the equations are the same as A and B.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.\n\nWait, but maybe instead of working with distances, it's easier to use the property that the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular. Since AC is from A(x, y) to C(-x, -y), the vector AC is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from B(a, b) to D(-a, -b), so the vector BD is (-2a, -2b).\n\nWait, but actually, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, vectors AC would be C - A = (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD would be D - B = (-a - a, -b - b) = (-2a, -2b). But for the diagonals to be perpendicular, their dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, AC \u00b7 BD = (-2x)(-2a) + (-2y)(-2b) = 4xa + 4yb = 0. Therefore, xa + yb = 0. That's an important equation.\n\nSo, we have two points A(x, y) and B(a, b) on the hyperbola, and their coordinates satisfy xa + yb = 0.\n\nNow, since it's a rhombus, the sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, which is equal to the distance from C to D, and so on. But maybe another way to think about it is that the vectors AB and AD are equal in length and the angle between them is such that the figure is a rhombus.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the slopes. Since the sides are equal and the diagonals are perpendicular, maybe we can use some parametrization.\n\nWait, let me think about parametrizing the hyperbola. For hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a parametrization can be done using hyperbolic functions: x = a cosh \u03b8, y = b sinh \u03b8. Alternatively, since hyperbola can also be parametrized as x = a sec t, y = b tan t, but that's for right-opening hyperbola.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the easiest way here. Alternatively, since points A and C are opposites through the origin, and B and D are opposites, maybe I can represent A and B in terms of some parameters.\n\nLet me think: Let\u2019s denote A as (x, y), so C is (-x, -y). Similarly, B is (a, b), D is (-a, -b). Since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are equal. So, the distance AB equals BC.\n\nBut calculating distances might get messy, but maybe I can use vectors. The vector AB is (a - x, b - y). The vector BC is (-x - a, -y - b). The lengths of these vectors must be equal. So,\n\n\u221a[(a - x)\u00b2 + (b - y)\u00b2] = \u221a[(-x - a)\u00b2 + (-y - b)\u00b2]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(a - x)\u00b2 + (b - y)\u00b2 = ( -x - a )\u00b2 + ( -y - b )\u00b2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: (a\u00b2 - 2ax + x\u00b2) + (b\u00b2 - 2by + y\u00b2)\nRight side: (x\u00b2 + 2ax + a\u00b2) + (y\u00b2 + 2by + b\u00b2)\n\nSubtracting left from right:\n\n[ x\u00b2 + 2ax + a\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2by + b\u00b2 ] - [ a\u00b2 - 2ax + x\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2by + y\u00b2 ] = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n( x\u00b2 + 2ax + a\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2by + b\u00b2 ) - a\u00b2 + 2ax - x\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + 2by - y\u00b2 = 0\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy. Let me compute term by term.\n\nLeft side: a\u00b2 - 2ax + x\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2by + y\u00b2\nRight side: a\u00b2 + 2ax + x\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2by + y\u00b2\n\nSubtracting left from right:\n\n(a\u00b2 + 2ax + x\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2by + y\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 - 2ax + x\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2by + y\u00b2) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(a\u00b2 - a\u00b2) + (2ax + 2ax) + (x\u00b2 - x\u00b2) + (b\u00b2 - b\u00b2) + (2by + 2by) + (y\u00b2 - y\u00b2) = 0\n\nSo, 4ax + 4by = 0.\n\nWhich gives ax + by = 0.\n\nWait, but earlier we had from the diagonals being perpendicular, xa + yb = 0. So, that's the same equation. So, that condition is necessary for the sides AB and BC to be equal.\n\nTherefore, the two conditions we have so far are:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 (since A is on hyperbola)\n2. a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1 (since B is on hyperbola)\n3. xa + yb = 0 (from the diagonals being perpendicular or sides being equal)\n\nSo, we have three equations.\n\nNow, since we need to find BD\u00b2, let's figure out what BD is. BD is the distance between points B(a, b) and D(-a, -b). So, BD is the distance between (a, b) and (-a, -b). The distance squared is (2a)^2 + (2b)^2 = 4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2. So, BD\u00b2 = 4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2.\n\nBut we need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, and then take the greatest number less than that. Wait, no, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is at least some number, so the greatest lower bound is the infimum.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, and then the answer would be that minimum, but since it's the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, perhaps it's the infimum.\n\nWait, actually, if BD\u00b2 can take a minimum value, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be that minimum. But maybe BD\u00b2 can't actually reach that minimum, so it's the infimum.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should proceed by trying to express BD\u00b2 in terms of some variables and then find its minimum.\n\nWe have BD\u00b2 = 4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So, we need to minimize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2, subject to a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1 and xa + yb = 0, where x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nWait, but we also have the condition xa + yb =0. So, we have to link these variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize points A and B.\n\nLet me think about parametrizing points A and B on the hyperbola. Since the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, I can write points on the hyperbola in terms of a parameter.\n\nOne standard parametrization for hyperbola is using hyperbolic functions: x = a cosh \u03b8, y = b sinh \u03b8, where a\u00b2 = 20, b\u00b2=24. So, a = 2\u221a5, b=2\u221a6.\n\nSo, let me define point A as (2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8). Then, point C is (-2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8, -2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, point B can be parametrized as (2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6), and point D is (-2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6, -2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6).\n\nBut then, the condition xa + yb =0 must be satisfied. Let's compute that:\n\nx = 2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8, a = 2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6\ny = 2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8, b = 2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6\n\nSo, xa + yb = (2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8)(2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6) + (2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8)(2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6) = 0\n\nCompute this:\n\n(2\u221a5)(2\u221a5) cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + (2\u221a6)(2\u221a6) sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(4*5) cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + (4*6) sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0\n20 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 24 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0\n\nHmm, this seems manageable. Let me write this as:\n\n5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 = -6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6\n\nDivide both sides by cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 (assuming they are non-zero, which they are because cosh is always \u22651):\n\n5 = -6 (sinh \u03b8 / cosh \u03b8) (sinh \u03c6 / cosh \u03c6)\n\nBut sinh t / cosh t = tanh t, so:\n\n5 = -6 tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6\n\nSo,\n\ntanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6 = -5/6\n\nHmm, so the product of the hyperbolic tangents is -5/6.\n\nThat's an interesting condition. So, \u03b8 and \u03c6 are related through this equation.\n\nNow, our goal is to find BD\u00b2, which is 4a\u00b2 +4b\u00b2. Since a and b are the coordinates of point B, which is (2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6), so a = 2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6, b = 2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = 20 cosh\u00b2 \u03c6, b\u00b2 = 24 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2 = 4*(20 cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6) = 4*(20 cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6)\n\nSimplify:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 80 cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 + 96 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe we can express this in terms of hyperbolic identities.\n\nWe know that cosh\u00b2 t - sinh\u00b2 t =1, so maybe express cosh\u00b2 in terms of sinh\u00b2.\n\ncosh\u00b2 \u03c6 = 1 + sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSubstitute into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 80*(1 + sinh\u00b2 \u03c6) + 96 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 = 80 + 80 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 + 96 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 = 80 + 176 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nWe need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2, so we need to minimize 80 + 176 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSince sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 is always non-negative, the minimum occurs when sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 is as small as possible. The minimum value of sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 is 0, which occurs when \u03c6=0.\n\nBut wait, let's see. If sinh \u03c6 =0, then \u03c6=0, so tanh \u03c6=0. Then, from the earlier equation tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6 = -5/6, tanh \u03b8 * 0 = -5/6, which would imply 0 = -5/6, which is impossible. So, sinh \u03c6 cannot be zero.\n\nSo, sinh \u03c6 cannot be zero, which means \u03c6 cannot be zero. Therefore, sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 must be positive. So, the minimum of BD\u00b2 would occur when sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 is as small as possible, but not zero.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can express sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 in terms of tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6.\n\nFrom the earlier equation, tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nLet me denote tanh \u03b8 = t, tanh \u03c6 = s. So, t*s = -5/6.\n\nWe also have:\n\nFrom BD\u00b2 =80 +176 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nExpress sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 in terms of s:\n\nsinh\u00b2 \u03c6 = (tanh\u00b2 \u03c6)/(1 - tanh\u00b2 \u03c6) = s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2)\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =80 +176*(s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2)).\n\nBut we have t*s = -5/6, and t = tanh \u03b8, s = tanh \u03c6.\n\nBut we can express t in terms of s or vice versa.\n\nFrom t*s = -5/6, t = (-5)/(6s).\n\nSo, let's express BD\u00b2 in terms of s.\n\nBD\u00b2 =80 + 176*(s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2)).\n\nBut we also need to ensure that |s| <1, since tanh \u03c6 is between -1 and 1.\n\nMoreover, since t*s = -5/6, and t must be between -1 and 1, s must satisfy |s| >=5/6, because |t*s| =5/6, and |t| <=1, so |s| >=5/6.\n\nSo, s is in (-1, -5/6] union [5/6, 1).\n\nSo, s\u00b2 >=25/36.\n\nSo, let's set s\u00b2 = k, where k >=25/36.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2 =80 +176*(k/(1 -k)).\n\nLet me write that as:\n\nBD\u00b2 =80 +176*(k/(1 -k)) =80 + 176k/(1 -k)\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 =80 +176k/(1 -k) =80 + [176/(1 -k)] *k\n\nBut 1 -k = 1 -s\u00b2 = (1 -s)(1 +s), but not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let's write BD\u00b2 as a function of k:\n\nf(k) =80 + (176k)/(1 -k)\n\nWe need to find the minimum of f(k) for k >=25/36.\n\nTo find the minimum, take the derivative of f(k) with respect to k:\n\nf'(k) = 176*( (1 -k) - (-1)*k )/(1 -k)^2 ) = 176*(1 -k +k)/(1 -k)^2 = 176/(1 -k)^2\n\nWhich is positive for all k <1. So, f(k) is increasing on the interval k <1.\n\nTherefore, the minimum of f(k) occurs at the smallest possible k, which is k=25/36.\n\nSo, plugging k=25/36 into f(k):\n\nf(25/36) =80 + (176*(25/36))/(1 -25/36)\n\nCompute denominator first: 1 -25/36=11/36.\n\nSo,\n\nf(25/36)=80 + (176*(25/36))/(11/36) =80 + (176*(25/36)) * (36/11) )\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe 36 cancels out, so:\n\n80 + (176*25)/11\n\nCompute 176/11=16, so 16*25=400.\n\nSo,\n\nf(25/36)=80 +400=480.\n\nTherefore, the minimum BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that when sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 is minimized, which would be when \u03c6 is as close to zero as possible, but that would make s=tanh \u03c6 approach zero, but due to the condition t*s =-5/6, s cannot approach zero. So, the minimum BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. If BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, but perhaps it can't actually reach 480, so the infimum is 480, but BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480.\n\nWait, but in our parametrization, when k=25/36, s\u00b2=25/36, so s=\u00b15/6. Then, t = (-5)/(6s) = (-5)/(6*(\u00b15/6)) = (-5)/(\u00b15)=\u22131.\n\nSo, tanh \u03b8=\u22131, which implies \u03b8=\u00b1arctanh(1). Wait, but arctanh(1) is infinity because tanh approaches 1 asymptotically. So, \u03b8 approaches infinity, making cosh \u03b8 and sinh \u03b8 approach infinity as well.\n\nWait, hold on. If \u03b8 approaches infinity, then point A is (2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8), which goes to infinity. Similarly, point B is (2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6), but when s=5/6, tanh \u03c6=5/6, which is a finite value, so \u03c6 is finite. Therefore, point B is finite.\n\nBut then, as \u03b8 approaches infinity, point A goes to infinity, but the rhombus would still have to satisfy the condition that diagonals intersect at the origin. But if A is at infinity, then C is at negative infinity, so the rhombus would be very large. But BD\u00b2 would be 480, which is the minimal value, but in reality, when \u03b8 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that when k=25/36, we can achieve BD\u00b2=480. Because when s=5/6, tanh \u03c6=5/6, which is a finite \u03c6, but tanh \u03b8= -1/( (5/6)/s )? Wait, no, tanh \u03b8 = (-5)/(6s). If s=5/6, tanh \u03b8= (-5)/(6*(5/6))= (-5)/5 = -1. So, tanh \u03b8= -1, which implies \u03b8 approaches negative infinity.\n\nBut hyperbolic functions: tanh \u03b8 approaches 1 as \u03b8 approaches positive infinity and approaches -1 as \u03b8 approaches negative infinity. So, \u03b8 approaches negative infinity, making cosh \u03b8 and sinh \u03b8 go to infinity as well. So, point A is still at infinity, but point B is finite.\n\nWait, but if point A is at infinity, then the rhombus ABCD would have points at infinity, which isn't really a \"rhombus\" in the usual sense, but in the projective plane, perhaps. But maybe in this problem, such configurations are allowed.\n\nBut then, BD\u00b2 can approach 480, but can it actually reach 480? Because when \u03b8 approaches negative infinity, point A approaches negative infinity, but BD\u00b2 is approaching 480.\n\nWait, but if we can achieve BD\u00b2=480, then 480 is attainable, but in reality, when \u03b8 approaches negative infinity, the coordinates of A go to infinity, but point B is finite.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute BD\u00b2 when s=5/6.\n\nIf s=5/6, then tanh \u03c6=5/6, so sinh \u03c6 = (5/6)/(sqrt(1 - (25/36))) )= (5/6)/sqrt(11/36)= (5/6)/(sqrt(11)/6)=5/sqrt(11).\n\nSimilarly, cosh \u03c6= sqrt(1 + sinh\u00b2 \u03c6)=sqrt(1 +25/11)=sqrt(36/11)=6/sqrt(11).\n\nSo, point B is (2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6)= (2\u221a5*(6/sqrt(11)), 2\u221a6*(5/sqrt(11)) )\n\nCompute that:\n\nx-coordinate: 2\u221a5*(6)/sqrt(11)=12\u221a5 / sqrt(11)\ny-coordinate: 2\u221a6*(5)/sqrt(11)=10\u221a6 / sqrt(11)\n\nSo, a=12\u221a5 / sqrt(11), b=10\u221a6 / sqrt(11)\n\nCompute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2= (144 *5)/11=720/11\nb\u00b2= (100 *6)/11=600/11\nSo, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2= (720 +600)/11=1320/11=120\n\nThus, BD\u00b2=4*(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2)=4*120=480.\n\nWait, so when s=5/6, BD\u00b2=480. But earlier, I thought that when s=5/6, \u03b8 approaches negative infinity, but in reality, when s=5/6, tanh \u03b8= -1, which is \u03b8 approaching negative infinity, but in this case, point B is finite, and point A is (2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8), with \u03b8 approaching negative infinity.\n\nBut as \u03b8 approaches negative infinity, cosh \u03b8 approaches infinity, sinh \u03b8 approaches negative infinity. So, point A approaches (\u00b1infinity, -infinity), but in our case, tanh \u03b8= -1, which is \u03b8 approaching negative infinity, so sinh \u03b8 approaches -infinity, and cosh \u03b8 approaches +infinity.\n\nWait, but in that case, point A would be (2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8) = (something very large positive, something very large negative). But for point A to be on the hyperbola, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1, so as x increases, y must also increase to satisfy the equation, but in this case, y is negative and large in magnitude. So, as \u03b8 approaches negative infinity, point A approaches (positive infinity, negative infinity), which is consistent with the hyperbola.\n\nBut in this case, point B is finite, and BD\u00b2=480. So, it seems that BD\u00b2 can actually reach 480 when point B is at (12\u221a5 / sqrt(11), 10\u221a6 / sqrt(11)).\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 480, which is attainable. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, since BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" If BD\u00b2 can be 480, then 480 is attainable, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, but since 480 is attainable, the infimum is 480, and thus the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Wait, no. Wait, if BD\u00b2 can be 480, then for that particular rhombus, BD\u00b2=480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi must be less than or equal to 480. But since 480 is attainable, the infimum is 480, and thus any number less than 480 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, then 480 is the minimum. Therefore, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is \u2265480. So, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, but since 480 is attainable, the infimum is 480. Therefore, the answer would be 480.\n\nWait, but hold on. Suppose BD\u00b2 can be 480, but can it be lower? If 480 is the minimum, then no, it can't be lower. So, 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 is at least 480, so 480 is the infimum. But since 480 is attainable, it's actually the minimum. So, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but in our earlier calculation, when s=5/6, we get BD\u00b2=480, which is attainable. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Because for that rhombus, BD\u00b2=480, so any number greater than 480 would not satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But since 480 is attainable, the infimum is 480, so the answer is 480.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, it's like the supremum of lower bounds of BD\u00b2. Since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, then 480 is the infimum. So, any number less than 480 would not be the greatest lower bound. But since 480 is attainable, it is the infimum and also the minimum.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, and 480 is achieved by at least one rhombus. So, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if 480 is attainable, then for that rhombus, BD\u00b2=480, so any number less than 480 would be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but 480 itself is not less than BD\u00b2 for that particular rhombus. Therefore, the greatest such number is the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, which would be 480, because BD\u00b2 is always at least 480. So, 480 is the infimum, and the answer is 480.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is \u2265480, then 480 is the greatest lower bound. So, the answer is 480.\n\nBut wait, no. Because 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 for every rhombus. Since BD\u00b2 can be 480, which is the minimal value, the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because for every \u03b5>0, 480 - \u03b5 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but 480 itself is not less than BD\u00b2 for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=480.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480, but since 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for that rhombus, perhaps the answer is 480, but in the context of the problem, maybe 480 is the correct answer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, but in reality, BD\u00b2 can't be exactly 480 because that would require point A to be at infinity, which isn't allowed. But in our earlier calculation, when s=5/6, point B is finite, and point A is at (2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8) where \u03b8 approaches negative infinity, making point A approach infinity. So, technically, such a rhombus would have one vertex at infinity, which is not really a rhombus in the traditional sense. Therefore, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but never actually reach it. Therefore, the infimum is 480, but it's not attained. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480.\n\nWait, but how does that work? If BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, then 480 is the infimum, but not the minimum. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, but can get as close as we like to 480. So, 480 is the infimum, and thus the answer is 480.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused about whether 480 is attainable or not. Let me recap:\n\nWhen we set s=5/6, which is allowed because |s|=5/6 <1, then point B is finite, and point A is at (2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8, 2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8) with \u03b8 approaching negative infinity. So, point A is at infinity, but in projective geometry, points at infinity are allowed. So, depending on the context, this might be acceptable.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it says \"points on the hyperbola,\" and points at infinity are not technically on the hyperbola in the affine plane. So, perhaps such a configuration isn't allowed, and therefore, BD\u00b2 can approach 480 but never actually reach it. So, the infimum is 480, but it's not attained, meaning BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus \\(ABCD\\) on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\), where the diagonals intersect at the origin. Points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) are \\((x, y)\\), \\((a, b)\\), \\((-x, -y)\\), and \\((-a, -b)\\), respectively.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Hyperbola Equations**: Points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) satisfy \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) and \\(\\frac{a^2}{20} - \\frac{b^2}{24} = 1\\).\n\n2. **Diagonals Perpendicularity**: The diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) are perpendicular, leading to the condition \\(xa + yb = 0\\).\n\n3. **BD\u00b2 Calculation**: The length of diagonal \\(BD\\) is given by \\(BD^2 = 4a^2 + 4b^2\\).\n\n4. **Parametrization**: Using hyperbolic functions, points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are parametrized as \\((2\\sqrt{5} \\cosh \\theta, 2\\sqrt{6} \\sinh \\theta)\\) and \\((2\\sqrt{5} \\cosh \\phi, 2\\sqrt{6} \\sinh \\phi)\\), respectively.\n\n5. **Condition from Perpendicularity**: The condition \\(xa + yb = 0\\) translates to \\(5 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi + 6 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi = 0\\), leading to \\(\\tanh \\theta \\tanh \\phi = -\\frac{5}{6}\\).\n\n6. **Minimizing BD\u00b2**: Expressing \\(BD^2\\) in terms of \\(\\phi\\), we find \\(BD^2 = 80 + 176 \\sinh^2 \\phi\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, and D on a hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. These four points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing with a kite. Let me double-check.\n\nNo, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, I think that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that means that the point where the diagonals intersect is the midpoint of both diagonals, and the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is (0,0), so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y) because the midpoint between A and C is the origin. Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D must be (-p, -q). So, the four points of the rhombus are A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), and D(-p, -q).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, which equals the distance between C and D, which equals the distance between D and A.\n\nBut before getting into distances, maybe I can use some properties of hyperbolas and rhombuses to simplify this problem.\n\nFirst, the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, this is a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis, with length 2a, where a\u00b2 = 20, so a = 2\u221a5. The conjugate axis is along the y-axis with length 2b, where b\u00b2 = 24, so b = 2\u221a6.\n\nNow, the points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, so their coordinates must satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, and the rhombus is formed by these four points, I can perhaps parametrize the points on the hyperbola.\n\nLet me consider parametrizing points A and B. Since A and C are opposites, and B and D are opposites, I can focus on points A and B.\n\nLet me think about the coordinates of A and B. Let me denote A as (x, y) and B as (p, q). Since both A and B lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, the vectors AB and AD must have the same length. Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to use vectors.\n\nLet me consider vectors. The diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the vectors AC and BD are such that their midpoints are the origin, which we already considered.\n\nMoreover, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. So, the dot product of vectors AC and BD should be zero.\n\nVector AC is from A to C, which is (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, vector BD is from B to D, which is (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q). So, the vectors AC and BD are (-2x, -2y) and (-2p, -2q), respectively.\n\nWait, but actually, the diagonals are AC and BD, so vectors AC and BD are from the origin to the points C and D, but in terms of vectors, they are (-2x, -2y) and (-2p, -2q). Wait, no, the diagonals are from A to C and from B to D. But since the origin is the midpoint, the vectors representing the diagonals would be AC and BD, but perhaps we can consider the vectors as OA and OB, but no, wait.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of vectors OA and OB, but that might not directly give the diagonals. Alternatively, the diagonals are vectors AC and BD, but since the origin is the midpoint, the position vectors of A and C are negatives, so the vector AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from B to D, which is (-2p, -2q). So, vectors AC and BD are (-2x, -2y) and (-2p, -2q), respectively.\n\nSince these diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product must be zero.\n\nSo, (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0.\n\nSimplifying, 4xp + 4yq = 0.\n\nDividing both sides by 4, xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, the condition is xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, that's one condition that points A and B must satisfy.\n\nAdditionally, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides must be equal in length. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C.\n\nWait, but since A is (x, y), B is (p, q), C is (-x, -y), and D is (-p, -q).\n\nSo, the distance AB is sqrt[(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2].\n\nThe distance BC is sqrt[(-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2].\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, AB = BC.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt[(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2] = sqrt[(-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2].\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2.\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side: (p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2) + (q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2).\n\nRight side: (x\u00b2 + 2px + p\u00b2) + (y\u00b2 + 2qy + q\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\nLeft: p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2.\n\nRight: x\u00b2 + 2px + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2qy + q\u00b2.\n\nSubtracting left from right:\n\n0 = (x\u00b2 + 2px + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2qy + q\u00b2) - (p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2).\n\nSimplify:\n\n0 = [x\u00b2 + 2px + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2qy + q\u00b2] - [x\u00b2 - 2px + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2qy + q\u00b2].\n\nExpanding the subtraction:\n\n0 = x\u00b2 + 2px + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2qy + q\u00b2 - x\u00b2 + 2px - p\u00b2 - y\u00b2 + 2qy - q\u00b2.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nx\u00b2 - x\u00b2 = 0.\n\n2px + 2px = 4px.\n\np\u00b2 - p\u00b2 = 0.\n\ny\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 0.\n\n2qy + 2qy = 4qy.\n\nq\u00b2 - q\u00b2 = 0.\n\nSo, 0 = 4px + 4qy.\n\nWhich simplifies to px + qy = 0.\n\nWait, but earlier we had from the diagonals being perpendicular that xp + yq = 0. So, this is the same equation.\n\nSo, the condition that AB = BC gives the same equation as the diagonals being perpendicular. So, in this case, these conditions are not independent. So, perhaps another condition is needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should also consider that in a rhombus, the adjacent sides are equal and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.\n\nWait, but perhaps another approach is better. Let me think about the slopes of the sides.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB and AD must have the same length. Alternatively, perhaps considering the vectors of the sides.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider the vectors AB and AD. Vector AB is (p - x, q - y), and vector AD is (-p - x, -q - y).\n\nWait, no, because point D is (-p, -q), so vector AD is from A(x, y) to D(-p, -q), which is (-p - x, -q - y).\n\nBut in a rhombus, the adjacent sides are equal in length and the angle between them can vary, but the lengths are the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the rhombus as a parallelogram with equal sides.\n\nWait, since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, and are perpendicular, perhaps the rhombus can be considered as formed by two perpendicular vectors from the origin, but scaled.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, maybe the rhombus can be considered as formed by vectors OA and OB, but that's not exactly correct because OA and OB are not necessarily the diagonals.\n\nWait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily aligned with the position vectors of the points. So, perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize points A and B such that their position vectors satisfy certain conditions.\n\nWait, perhaps I can parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola in terms of hyperbola parameters.\n\nWait, hyperbola parametrization can be done using hyperbolic functions. For a hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a parametrization is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), or alternatively, using hyperbola functions: (a cosh t, b sinh t). But since hyperbola points can be parametrized using hyperbola angles, perhaps I can use that.\n\nBut maybe using parametric equations for hyperbola would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can express points A and B as (x, y) and (p, q), lying on the hyperbola, and satisfying the condition xp + yq = 0 from the diagonals being perpendicular.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that.\n\nWe have points A(x, y) and B(p, q), lying on the hyperbola, so:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAdditionally, from the diagonals being perpendicular, we have xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, our goal is to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD.\n\nWait, BD is the diagonal from B(p, q) to D(-p, -q). So, the length of BD is the distance between (p, q) and (-p, -q), which is sqrt[( -p - p)^2 + (-q - q)^2] = sqrt[(-2p)^2 + (-2q)^2] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD squared is [2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)]\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nWe need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, we need the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi ABCD as described. Then, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum, since BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to it but not less than it.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is greater than or equal to this infimum, and this infimum is the greatest lower bound.\n\nSo, our task reduces to finding the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, which is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), given the constraints.\n\nSo, we can restate the problem: minimize 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) subject to the constraints:\n\n1. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\n2. xp + yq = 0,\n\nand points A(x, y) and B(p, q) lie on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, but we also have point A(x, y) on the hyperbola, so x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\n2. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\n3. xp + yq = 0.\n\nWe need to find the minimum of 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nHmm, so perhaps I can express x and y in terms of p and q, using the third equation, and then substitute into the first equation.\n\nFrom equation 3: xp + yq = 0 \u21d2 y = (-xp)/q, assuming q \u2260 0.\n\nSubstituting into equation 1:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - [(-xp/q)^2]/24 = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(24 q\u00b2) = 1.\n\nFactor x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 [1/20 - p\u00b2/(24 q\u00b2)] = 1.\n\nHmm, but this seems a bit messy. Maybe instead, I can find a relationship between p and q.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider that since points A and B are related through xp + yq = 0, perhaps there's a linear algebra approach here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of points A and B as lying on the hyperbola and satisfying xp + yq = 0. So, perhaps I can parametrize points A and B such that this condition holds.\n\nWait, perhaps using vectors. Let me denote vector OA as (x, y) and vector OB as (p, q). Then, the condition is that OA \u00b7 OB = 0, since xp + yq = 0. So, vectors OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nWait, that's an important observation. So, points A and B are such that their position vectors from the origin are perpendicular. So, OA \u22a5 OB.\n\nSo, the points A and B lie on the hyperbola and their position vectors are perpendicular.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding two points A and B on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 such that OA is perpendicular to OB, and then finding the minimum of BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, since OA and OB are perpendicular, we can parametrize points A and B such that OA \u00b7 OB = 0.\n\nLet me consider that if OA is (x, y), then OB is (p, q) such that xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express p and q in terms of x and y, and then substitute into the hyperbola equation for B.\n\nFrom xp + yq = 0, we can express p = (-y k) and q = (x k) for some scalar k, because then xp + yq = x*(-y k) + y*(x k) = -xy k + xy k = 0.\n\nWait, that's a neat approach. So, if I let p = -y k and q = x k, then xp + yq = x*(-y k) + y*(x k) = 0.\n\nSo, points B can be parametrized as (p, q) = (-y k, x k) for some scalar k.\n\nNow, since B lies on the hyperbola, we can substitute p and q into the hyperbola equation:\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSubstituting p = -y k and q = x k:\n\n[(-y k)^2]/20 - [(x k)^2]/24 = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(y\u00b2 k\u00b2)/20 - (x\u00b2 k\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nFactor out k\u00b2:\n\nk\u00b2 [y\u00b2/20 - x\u00b2/24] = 1.\n\nBut from point A lying on the hyperbola, we have x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, let's denote that as equation (1): x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, the expression inside the brackets in the equation for B is [y\u00b2/20 - x\u00b2/24] = -(x\u00b2/24 - y\u00b2/20) = -( [x\u00b2/(24)] - [y\u00b2/(20)] )\n\nWait, let's compute y\u00b2/20 - x\u00b2/24:\n\n= (y\u00b2/20) - (x\u00b2/24).\n\nHmm, let's see, from equation (1), x\u00b2/20 = y\u00b2/24 + 1.\n\nSo, perhaps we can express y\u00b2 in terms of x\u00b2.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\ny\u00b2 = (x\u00b2/20 - 1) * 24 = (24/20)x\u00b2 - 24 = (6/5)x\u00b2 - 24.\n\nSubstituting into [y\u00b2/20 - x\u00b2/24]:\n\n= [ (6/5 x\u00b2 - 24)/20 ] - (x\u00b2/24 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (6x\u00b2/(5*20)) - (24/20) - x\u00b2/24\n\n= (6x\u00b2/100) - (6/5) - x\u00b2/24\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\n6x\u00b2/100 = (3x\u00b2)/50,\n\n6/5 remains as is,\n\nx\u00b2/24 remains as is.\n\nSo,\n\n= (3x\u00b2/50) - 6/5 - (x\u00b2/24).\n\nLet me find a common denominator for the x\u00b2 terms. The denominators are 50 and 24. The least common multiple of 50 and 24 is 600.\n\nSo,\n\n3x\u00b2/50 = (36x\u00b2)/600,\n\nx\u00b2/24 = 25x\u00b2/600.\n\nSo,\n\n= (36x\u00b2/600) - 6/5 - (25x\u00b2/600)\n\n= (36x\u00b2 - 25x\u00b2)/600 - 6/5\n\n= (11x\u00b2)/600 - 6/5.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the expression [y\u00b2/20 - x\u00b2/24] becomes (11x\u00b2)/600 - 6/5.\n\nSo, going back to the equation for B:\n\nk\u00b2 [ (11x\u00b2)/600 - 6/5 ] = 1.\n\nSo,\n\nk\u00b2 = 1 / [ (11x\u00b2)/600 - 6/5 ]\n\n= 1 / [ (11x\u00b2 - 720)/600 ]\n\n= 600 / (11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nSo, k\u00b2 = 600 / (11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nBut since k\u00b2 must be positive (as it's a square of a real number), the denominator must be positive:\n\n11x\u00b2 - 720 > 0 \u21d2 x\u00b2 > 720/11 \u2248 65.4545.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 must be greater than 720/11 for k\u00b2 to be positive.\n\nNow, since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, and we have expressed k in terms of x, we can now express BD\u00b2 in terms of x.\n\nRecall that BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nBut p = -y k and q = x k, so:\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = y\u00b2 k\u00b2 + x\u00b2 k\u00b2 = k\u00b2 (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 k\u00b2 (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nNow, from equation (1), x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 \u21d2 y\u00b2 = (x\u00b2/20 - 1) * 24 = (6x\u00b2/5) - 24.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (6x\u00b2/5 - 24) = (5x\u00b2 + 6x\u00b2)/5 - 24 = (11x\u00b2)/5 - 24.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2 = 4 * k\u00b2 * (11x\u00b2/5 - 24).\n\nBut we have k\u00b2 = 600 / (11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * [600 / (11x\u00b2 - 720)] * [ (11x\u00b2/5) - 24 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst, compute [ (11x\u00b2/5) - 24 ].\n\n= (11x\u00b2 - 120)/5.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * [600 / (11x\u00b2 - 720)] * [ (11x\u00b2 - 120)/5 ]\n\n= 4 * [600 * (11x\u00b2 - 120) ] / [5*(11x\u00b2 - 720)].\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n600 /5 = 120,\n\nSo,\n\n= 4 * [120*(11x\u00b2 - 120)] / (11x\u00b2 - 720)\n\n= 4 * [120*(11x\u00b2 - 120)] / (11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\n11x\u00b2 - 720 = 11x\u00b2 - 720,\n\n11x\u00b2 - 120 = 11x\u00b2 - 120.\n\nWait, perhaps we can factor 11x\u00b2 - 720 as 11x\u00b2 - 720 = 11x\u00b2 - 120*6 = 11x\u00b2 - 120*6.\n\nWait, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps we can write both in terms of a common factor.\n\nWait, let me compute the expression:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * [120*(11x\u00b2 - 120)] / (11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nI can write this as:\n\n= 4 * 120 * (11x\u00b2 - 120) / (11x\u00b2 - 720)\n\n= 480 * (11x\u00b2 - 120) / (11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nNow, let me write this as:\n\n= 480 * [ (11x\u00b2 - 120) / (11x\u00b2 - 720) ]\n\n= 480 * [ (11x\u00b2 - 120) / (11x\u00b2 - 720) ]\n\nHmm, perhaps I can simplify this fraction.\n\nLet me denote t = 11x\u00b2.\n\nThen, the expression becomes:\n\n= 480 * (t - 120) / (t - 720).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480 * (t - 120)/(t - 720).\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n= 480 * [ (t - 120) / (t - 720) ]\n\n= 480 * [ (t - 720 + 600) / (t - 720) ]\n\n= 480 * [ 1 + 600/(t - 720) ]\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nt - 120 = (t - 720) + 600.\n\nYes, because (t - 720) + 600 = t - 120.\n\nSo,\n\n= 480 * [ (t - 720 + 600) / (t - 720) ]\n\n= 480 * [ 1 + 600/(t - 720) ]\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480 * [1 + 600/(t - 720)].\n\nNow, since t = 11x\u00b2, and we have from earlier that x\u00b2 > 720/11 \u2248 65.4545.\n\nSo, t = 11x\u00b2 > 720, so t - 720 > 0.\n\nThus, the denominator is positive, and 600/(t - 720) is positive.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is a function of t, where t > 720.\n\nWe can write BD\u00b2 as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480 + 480 * [600/(t - 720)].\n\nHmm, so BD\u00b2 is 480 plus a positive term. To minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize this expression.\n\nSince t > 720, as t approaches 720 from above, the term 600/(t - 720) approaches +infinity, making BD\u00b2 approach infinity.\n\nWait, that can't be right, because we're trying to find the minimum BD\u00b2, so perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.\n\nWait, let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake when factoring.\n\nWait, let me go back to the point where I expressed BD\u00b2 as 480*(11x\u00b2 - 120)/(11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nWait, maybe I should simplify this fraction differently.\n\nLet me compute (11x\u00b2 - 120)/(11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator.\n\nWait, 11x\u00b2 - 120 = 11x\u00b2 - 120,\n\n11x\u00b2 - 720 = 11x\u00b2 - 720.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor 11x\u00b2 - 720 as 11(x\u00b2) - 720, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe factor numerator and denominator as follows:\n\n(11x\u00b2 - 120) = 11x\u00b2 - 120,\n\n(11x\u00b2 - 720) = 11x\u00b2 - 720.\n\nHmm, perhaps write it as:\n\n= (11x\u00b2 - 120)/(11x\u00b2 - 720) = [11x\u00b2 - 720 + 600]/(11x\u00b2 - 720) = 1 + 600/(11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480 * [1 + 600/(11x\u00b2 - 720)].\n\nNow, as x\u00b2 increases beyond 720/11, the term 600/(11x\u00b2 - 720) decreases because the denominator increases.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is minimized when 600/(11x\u00b2 - 720) is minimized, which occurs when (11x\u00b2 - 720) is maximized. But since x\u00b2 can be any value greater than 720/11, the term 600/(11x\u00b2 - 720) approaches zero as x\u00b2 approaches infinity. Thus, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as x\u00b2 becomes very large.\n\nWait, but that suggests that the minimum value of BD\u00b2 is 480, approached as x\u00b2 approaches infinity. But that can't be correct because when x\u00b2 approaches infinity, point A would be very far along the hyperbola, and point B, being perpendicular, would also be far away, but their positions would adjust such that BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, let me go back to BD\u00b2 expression.\n\nWe had BD\u00b2 = 4*(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 4*(y\u00b2 k\u00b2 + x\u00b2 k\u00b2) = 4k\u00b2(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nBut from earlier, we have k\u00b2 = 600/(11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nAnd x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = (11x\u00b2)/5 - 24.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4*(600/(11x\u00b2 - 720)) * (11x\u00b2/5 - 24).\n\nLet me compute this expression step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (11x\u00b2/5 - 24):\n\n= (11x\u00b2 - 120)/5.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4*(600/(11x\u00b2 - 720)) * (11x\u00b2 - 120)/5\n\n= 4*(600*(11x\u00b2 - 120))/(5*(11x\u00b2 - 720)).\n\nSimplify:\n\n600 divided by 5 is 120,\n\nSo,\n\n= 4*(120*(11x\u00b2 - 120))/(11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\n= 480*(11x\u00b2 - 120)/(11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480*(11x\u00b2 - 120)/(11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nLet me denote t = 11x\u00b2, so t > 720.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2 = 480*(t - 120)/(t - 720).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480*(t - 120)/(t - 720) = 480*( (t - 720) + 600 )/(t - 720) ) = 480*(1 + 600/(t - 720)).\n\nSo, as t increases beyond 720, the term 600/(t - 720) decreases towards zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480*1 = 480.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, but can it actually reach 480?\n\nWait, when t approaches infinity, 600/(t - 720) approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, but BD\u00b2 can't actually be less than 480, since as t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be 480, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, and can get arbitrarily close to 480.\n\nWait, but let me check if BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480.\n\nSuppose BD\u00b2 = 480.\n\nThen, 480 = 480*(1 + 600/(t - 720)).\n\nDivide both sides by 480:\n\n1 = 1 + 600/(t - 720).\n\nSubtract 1:\n\n0 = 600/(t - 720).\n\nWhich implies 600 = 0, which is impossible. So, BD\u00b2 can't be exactly 480, but can approach it as t approaches infinity.\n\nSo, the infimum is 480, meaning that BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but never less than 480.\n\nWait, but wait, let's test with specific points to see if BD\u00b2 can be less than 480.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps because I thought BD\u00b2 approaches 480, but maybe it's the other way around.\n\nWait, let's consider when x\u00b2 is just slightly larger than 720/11.\n\nLet me compute BD\u00b2 for x\u00b2 approaching 720/11 from above.\n\nWhen x\u00b2 approaches 720/11, t approaches 720, so t - 720 approaches zero from the positive side.\n\nSo, 600/(t - 720) approaches +infinity, making BD\u00b2 approach infinity.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is minimized when x\u00b2 is as large as possible, approaching infinity, leading BD\u00b2 to approach 480.\n\nSo, the minimal value that BD\u00b2 can approach is 480, but it can't be less than that.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, since BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because if BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480, then 480 is the infimum. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but let me test with specific points to see.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a specific rhombus where BD\u00b2 is exactly 480.\n\nWait, but from the earlier equation, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as x\u00b2 approaches infinity, but never actually reaches it. So, the infimum is 480, but BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check my earlier algebra again because I might have made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I can use Lagrange multipliers to minimize BD\u00b2 subject to the constraints.\n\nWe need to minimize BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2),\n\nsubject to:\n\n1. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\n2. xp + yq = 0,\n\nand x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nThis is a constrained optimization problem with multiple variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize points A and B in terms of an angle.\n\nWait, since OA and OB are perpendicular, perhaps I can consider points A and B as (x, y) and (-y, x), scaled appropriately to lie on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, but the hyperbola isn't a circle, so scaling might not preserve the hyperbola condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize points A and B such that OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nWait, let me consider that if OA and OB are perpendicular, then OB can be represented as a 90-degree rotation of OA, scaled by some factor.\n\nBut since the hyperbola isn't a circle, this might not directly apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that for any point A(x, y) on the hyperbola, point B can be taken as (k*(-y), k*x) for some k, ensuring that OA \u00b7 OB = 0.\n\nThen, B must lie on the hyperbola, so substituting into the hyperbola equation:\n\n(k*(-y))\u00b2/20 - (k*x)^2/24 = 1,\n\nwhich is (k\u00b2 y\u00b2)/20 - (k\u00b2 x\u00b2)/24 = 1,\n\nk\u00b2 (y\u00b2/20 - x\u00b2/24) = 1.\n\nBut from point A, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 \u21d2 y\u00b2/24 = x\u00b2/20 - 1 \u21d2 y\u00b2 = (24/20)x\u00b2 -24 = (6/5)x\u00b2 -24.\n\nSubstituting into the equation for B:\n\nk\u00b2 [ (6/5 x\u00b2 -24)/20 - x\u00b2/24 ] = 1.\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n= [ (6x\u00b2/5 -24)/20 - x\u00b2/24 ]\n\n= (6x\u00b2/(5*20)) - (24/20) - x\u00b2/24\n\n= (6x\u00b2/100) - (6/5) - x\u00b2/24\n\n= (3x\u00b2/50) - (6/5) - x\u00b2/24.\n\nFinding a common denominator, which is 600:\n\n= (36x\u00b2/600) - (720/600) - (25x\u00b2/600)\n\n= (36x\u00b2 -25x\u00b2 -720)/600\n\n= (11x\u00b2 -720)/600.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nk\u00b2 * (11x\u00b2 -720)/600 = 1 \u21d2 k\u00b2 = 600/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nThus, k\u00b2 must be positive, so 11x\u00b2 -720 > 0 \u21d2 x\u00b2 > 720/11 \u2248 65.4545.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 4(k\u00b2 y\u00b2 + k\u00b2 x\u00b2) = 4k\u00b2 (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nBut from point A, y\u00b2 = (6/5)x\u00b2 -24,\n\nso x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (6/5)x\u00b2 -24 = (11/5)x\u00b2 -24.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * [600/(11x\u00b2 -720)] * [ (11/5)x\u00b2 -24 ]\n\n= 4 * [600 * (11x\u00b2 - 120)/5 ] / (11x\u00b2 -720 )\n\n= 4 * [120*(11x\u00b2 -120)] / (11x\u00b2 -720 )\n\n= 480*(11x\u00b2 -120)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nWhich is the same expression as before.\n\nSo, this confirms that BD\u00b2 = 480*(11x\u00b2 -120)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nNow, to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2, we can analyze this function as x\u00b2 varies over values greater than 720/11.\n\nLet me let t = 11x\u00b2, so t > 720.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480*(t - 120)/(t - 720).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480*(t - 120)/(t - 720) = 480*( (t -720) + 600 )/(t -720) = 480*(1 + 600/(t -720)).\n\nSo, as t increases beyond 720, the term 600/(t -720) decreases, approaching zero. Thus, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above as t approaches infinity.\n\nSo, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 480, but it's not attainable. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me test with specific values to see if BD\u00b2 can be less than 480.\n\nWait, for example, take a very large x\u00b2, say x\u00b2 = 10^6. Then, t = 11*10^6 = 11,000,000.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480*(11,000,000 - 120)/(11,000,000 -720) \u2248 480*(11,000,000)/(11,000,000) = 480*(1) = 480.\n\nSo, as x\u00b2 increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut when x\u00b2 is just slightly larger than 720/11, say x\u00b2 = 720/11 + \u03b5, where \u03b5 is a small positive number, then t = 11x\u00b2 = 720 + 11\u03b5.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480*(720 +11\u03b5 -120)/(720 +11\u03b5 -720) = 480*(600 +11\u03b5)/(11\u03b5).\n\nAs \u03b5 approaches zero, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity, as expected.\n\nSo, indeed, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 from above, but never less than 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I initially thought about this, I thought the answer would be 480, but maybe I should verify.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps find the minimal value of BD\u00b2 by taking derivative with respect to x\u00b2 and finding the minimum.\n\nLet me consider BD\u00b2 as a function of t = 11x\u00b2, where t >720.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(t) = 480*(t -120)/(t -720).\n\nWe can find the derivative of BD\u00b2 with respect to t to find minima or maxima.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(t) = 480*(t -120)/(t -720).\n\nLet me compute d(BD\u00b2)/dt:\n\n= 480 * [ (1)(t -720) - (t -120)(1) ] / (t -720)^2\n\n= 480 * [ (t -720 - t + 120) ] / (t -720)^2\n\n= 480 * [ (-600) ] / (t -720)^2\n\n= -480*600 / (t -720)^2.\n\nSince t >720, the denominator is positive, and the numerator is negative, so d(BD\u00b2)/dt is negative.\n\nThis means that BD\u00b2 is a decreasing function of t. So, as t increases, BD\u00b2 decreases.\n\nWait, that's interesting because earlier, as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, and as t approaches 720 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 480, approached as t approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but since BD\u00b2 is a decreasing function of t, the minimal value is 480, and it's unbounded above.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought that BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as t increases. Wait, no, because as t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above, which would mean that 480 is the infimum.\n\nWait, but according to the derivative, since BD\u00b2 is decreasing, the minimal value is achieved as t approaches infinity, which is 480.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, but it's never actually reached, only approached.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, and D on a hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. These four points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing with a kite. Let me double-check.\n\nNo, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, I think that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that means that the point where the diagonals intersect is the midpoint of both diagonals, and the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is (0,0), so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y) because the midpoint between A and C is the origin. Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D must be (-p, -q). So, the four points of the rhombus are A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), and D(-p, -q).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, which equals the distance between C and D, which equals the distance between D and A.\n\nBut before getting into distances, maybe I can use some properties of hyperbolas and rhombuses to simplify this problem.\n\nFirst, the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, this is a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis, with length 2a, where a\u00b2 = 20, so a = 2\u221a5. The conjugate axis is along the y-axis with length 2b, where b\u00b2 = 24, so b = 2\u221a6.\n\nNow, the points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, so their coordinates must satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, and the rhombus is formed by these four points, I can perhaps parametrize the points on the hyperbola.\n\nLet me consider parametrizing points A and B. Since A and C are opposites, and B and D are opposites, I can focus on points A and B.\n\nLet me think about the coordinates of A and B. Let me denote A as (x, y) and B as (p, q). Since both A and B lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, the vectors AB and AD must have the same length. Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to use vectors.\n\nLet me consider vectors. The diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the vectors AC and BD are such that their midpoints are the origin, which we already considered.\n\nMoreover, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. So, the dot product of vectors AC and BD should be zero.\n\nVector AC is from A to C, which is (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, vector BD is from B to D, which is (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q). So, the vectors AC and BD are (-2x, -2y) and (-2p, -2q), respectively.\n\nWait, but actually, the diagonals are AC and BD, so vectors AC and BD are from the origin to the points C and D, but in terms of vectors, they are (-2x, -2y) and (-2p, -2q). Wait, no, the diagonals are from A to C and from B to D. But since the origin is the midpoint, the vectors representing the diagonals would be AC and BD, but perhaps we can consider the vectors as OA and OB, but no, wait.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of vectors OA and OB, but that might not directly give the diagonals. Alternatively, the diagonals are vectors AC and BD, but since the origin is the midpoint, the position vectors of A and C are negatives, so the vector AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from B to D, which is (-2p, -2q). So, vectors AC and BD are (-2x, -2y) and (-2p, -2q), respectively.\n\nSince these diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product must be zero.\n\nSo, (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0.\n\nSimplifying, 4xp + 4yq = 0.\n\nDividing both sides by 4, xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, the condition is xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, that's one condition that points A and B must satisfy.\n\nAdditionally, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides must be equal in length. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C.\n\nWait, but since A is (x, y), B is (p, q), C is (-x, -y), and D is (-p, -q).\n\nSo, the distance AB is sqrt[(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2].\n\nThe distance BC is sqrt[(-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2].\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, AB = BC.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt[(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2] = sqrt[(-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2].\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2.\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side: (p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2) + (q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2).\n\nRight side: (x\u00b2 + 2px + p\u00b2) + (y\u00b2 + 2qy + q\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\nLeft: p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2.\n\nRight: x\u00b2 + 2px + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2qy + q\u00b2.\n\nSubtracting left from right:\n\n0 = (x\u00b2 + 2px + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2qy + q\u00b2) - (p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2).\n\nSimplify:\n\n0 = [x\u00b2 + 2px + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2qy + q\u00b2] - [x\u00b2 - 2px + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2qy + q\u00b2].\n\nExpanding the subtraction:\n\n0 = x\u00b2 + 2px + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2qy + q\u00b2 - x\u00b2 + 2px - p\u00b2 - y\u00b2 + 2qy - q\u00b2.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nx\u00b2 - x\u00b2 = 0.\n\n2px + 2px = 4px.\n\np\u00b2 - p\u00b2 = 0.\n\ny\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 0.\n\n2qy + 2qy = 4qy.\n\nq\u00b2 - q\u00b2 = 0.\n\nSo, 0 = 4px + 4qy.\n\nWhich simplifies to px + qy = 0.\n\nWait, but earlier we had from the diagonals being perpendicular that xp + yq = 0. So, this is the same equation.\n\nSo, the condition that AB = BC gives the same equation as the diagonals being perpendicular. So, in this case, these conditions are not independent. So, perhaps another condition is needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should also consider that in a rhombus, the adjacent sides are equal and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.\n\nWait, but perhaps another approach is better. Let me think about the slopes of the sides.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB and AD must have the same length. Alternatively, perhaps considering the vectors of the sides.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider the vectors AB and AD. Vector AB is (p - x, q - y), and vector AD is (-p - x, -q - y).\n\nWait, no, because point D is (-p, -q), so vector AD is from A(x, y) to D(-p, -q), which is (-p - x, -q - y).\n\nBut in a rhombus, the adjacent sides are equal in length and the angle between them can vary, but the lengths are the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the rhombus as a parallelogram with equal sides.\n\nWait, since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, and are perpendicular, perhaps the rhombus can be considered as formed by two perpendicular vectors from the origin, but scaled.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, maybe the rhombus can be considered as formed by vectors OA and OB, but that's not exactly correct because OA and OB are not necessarily the diagonals.\n\nWait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily aligned with the position vectors of the points. So, perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize points A and B such that their position vectors satisfy certain conditions.\n\nWait, perhaps I can parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola in terms of hyperbola parameters.\n\nWait, hyperbola parametrization can be done using hyperbolic functions. For a hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a parametrization is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), or alternatively, using hyperbola functions: (a cosh t, b sinh t). But since hyperbola points can be parametrized using hyperbola angles, perhaps I can use that.\n\nBut maybe using parametric equations for hyperbola would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can express points A and B as (x, y) and (p, q), lying on the hyperbola, and satisfying the condition xp + yq = 0 from the diagonals being perpendicular.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that.\n\nWe have points A(x, y) and B(p, q), lying on the hyperbola, so:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAdditionally, from the diagonals being perpendicular, we have xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, our goal is to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD.\n\nWait, BD is the diagonal from B(p, q) to D(-p, -q). So, the length of BD is the distance between (p, q) and (-p, -q), which is sqrt[( -p - p)^2 + (-q - q)^2] = sqrt[(-2p)^2 + (-2q)^2] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD squared is [2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)]\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nWe need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, we need the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi ABCD as described. Then, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum, since BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to it but not less than it.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is greater than or equal to this infimum, and this infimum is the greatest lower bound.\n\nSo, our task reduces to finding the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, which is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), given the constraints.\n\nSo, we can restate the problem: minimize 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) subject to the constraints:\n\n1. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\n2. xp + yq = 0,\n\nand points A(x, y) and B(p, q) lie on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, but we also have point A(x, y) on the hyperbola, so x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\n2. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\n3. xp + yq = 0.\n\nWe need to find the minimum of 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nHmm, so perhaps I can express x and y in terms of p and q, using the third equation, and then substitute into the first equation.\n\nFrom equation 3: xp + yq = 0 \u21d2 y = (-xp)/q, assuming q \u2260 0.\n\nSubstituting into equation 1:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - [(-xp/q)^2]/24 = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(24 q\u00b2) = 1.\n\nFactor x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 [1/20 - p\u00b2/(24 q\u00b2)] = 1.\n\nHmm, but this seems a bit messy. Maybe instead, I can find a relationship between p and q.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider that since points A and B are related through xp + yq = 0, perhaps there's a linear algebra approach here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of points A and B as lying on the hyperbola and satisfying xp + yq = 0. So, perhaps I can parametrize points A and B such that this condition holds.\n\nWait, perhaps using vectors. Let me denote vector OA as (x, y) and vector OB as (p, q). Then, the condition is that OA \u00b7 OB = 0, since xp + yq = 0. So, vectors OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nWait, that's an important observation. So, points A and B are such that their position vectors from the origin are perpendicular. So, OA \u22a5 OB.\n\nSo, the points A and B lie on the hyperbola and their position vectors are perpendicular.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding two points A and B on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 such that OA is perpendicular to OB, and then finding the minimum of BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, since OA and OB are perpendicular, we can parametrize points A and B such that OA \u00b7 OB = 0.\n\nLet me consider that if OA is (x, y), then OB is (p, q) such that xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express p and q in terms of x and y, and then substitute into the hyperbola equation for B.\n\nFrom xp + yq = 0, we can express p = (-y k) and q = (x k) for some scalar k, because then xp + yq = x*(-y k) + y*(x k) = -xy k + xy k = 0.\n\nWait, that's a neat approach. So, if I let p = -y k and q = x k, then xp + yq = x*(-y k) + y*(x k) = 0.\n\nSo, points B can be parametrized as (p, q) = (-y k, x k) for some scalar k.\n\nNow, since B lies on the hyperbola, we can substitute p and q into the hyperbola equation:\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSubstituting p = -y k and q = x k:\n\n[(-y k)^2]/20 - [(x k)^2]/24 = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(y\u00b2 k\u00b2)/20 - (x\u00b2 k\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nFactor out k\u00b2:\n\nk\u00b2 [y\u00b2/20 - x\u00b2/24] = 1.\n\nBut from point A lying on the hyperbola, we have x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, let's denote that as equation (1): x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, the expression inside the brackets in the equation for B is [y\u00b2/20 - x\u00b2/24] = -(x\u00b2/24 - y\u00b2/20) = -( [x\u00b2/(24)] - [y\u00b2/(20)] )\n\nWait, let's compute y\u00b2/20 - x\u00b2/24:\n\n= (y\u00b2/20) - (x\u00b2/24).\n\nHmm, let's see, from equation (1), x\u00b2/20 = y\u00b2/24 + 1.\n\nSo, perhaps we can express y\u00b2 in terms of x\u00b2.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\ny\u00b2 = (x\u00b2/20 - 1) * 24 = (24/20)x\u00b2 - 24 = (6/5)x\u00b2 - 24.\n\nSubstituting into [y\u00b2/20 - x\u00b2/24]:\n\n= [ (6/5 x\u00b2 - 24)/20 ] - (x\u00b2/24 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (6x\u00b2/(5*20)) - (24/20) - x\u00b2/24\n\n= (6x\u00b2/100) - (6/5) - x\u00b2/24\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\n6x\u00b2/100 = (3x\u00b2)/50,\n\n6/5 remains as is,\n\nx\u00b2/24 remains as is.\n\nSo,\n\n= (3x\u00b2/50) - 6/5 - (x\u00b2/24).\n\nLet me find a common denominator for the x\u00b2 terms. The denominators are 50 and 24. The least common multiple of 50 and 24 is 600.\n\nSo,\n\n3x\u00b2/50 = (36x\u00b2)/600,\n\nx\u00b2/24 = 25x\u00b2/600.\n\nSo,\n\n= (36x\u00b2/600) - 6/5 - (25x\u00b2/600)\n\n= (36x\u00b2 - 25x\u00b2)/600 - 6/5\n\n= (11x\u00b2)/600 - 6/5.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the expression [y\u00b2/20 - x\u00b2/24] becomes (11x\u00b2)/600 - 6/5.\n\nSo, going back to the equation for B:\n\nk\u00b2 [ (11x\u00b2)/600 - 6/5 ] = 1.\n\nSo,\n\nk\u00b2 = 1 / [ (11x\u00b2)/600 - 6/5 ]\n\n= 1 / [ (11x\u00b2 - 720)/600 ]\n\n= 600 / (11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nSo, k\u00b2 = 600 / (11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nBut since k\u00b2 must be positive (as it's a square of a real number), the denominator must be positive:\n\n11x\u00b2 - 720 > 0 \u21d2 x\u00b2 > 720/11 \u2248 65.4545.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 must be greater than 720/11 for k\u00b2 to be positive.\n\nNow, since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, and we have expressed k in terms of x, we can now express BD\u00b2 in terms of x.\n\nRecall that BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nBut p = -y k and q = x k, so:\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = y\u00b2 k\u00b2 + x\u00b2 k\u00b2 = k\u00b2 (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 k\u00b2 (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nNow, from equation (1), x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 \u21d2 y\u00b2 = (x\u00b2/20 - 1) * 24 = (6x\u00b2/5) - 24.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (6x\u00b2/5 - 24) = (5x\u00b2 + 6x\u00b2)/5 - 24 = (11x\u00b2)/5 - 24.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2 = 4 * k\u00b2 * (11x\u00b2/5 - 24).\n\nBut we have k\u00b2 = 600 / (11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * [600 / (11x\u00b2 - 720)] * [ (11x\u00b2/5) - 24 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst, compute [ (11x\u00b2/5) - 24 ].\n\n= (11x\u00b2 - 120)/5.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * [600 / (11x\u00b2 - 720)] * [ (11x\u00b2 - 120)/5 ]\n\n= 4 * [600 * (11x\u00b2 - 120) ] / [5*(11x\u00b2 - 720)].\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n600 /5 = 120,\n\nSo,\n\n= 4 * [120*(11x\u00b2 - 120)] / (11x\u00b2 - 720)\n\n= 4 * [120*(11x\u00b2 - 120)] / (11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\n11x\u00b2 - 720 = 11x\u00b2 - 720,\n\n11x\u00b2 - 120 = 11x\u00b2 - 120.\n\nWait, perhaps we can factor 11x\u00b2 - 720 as 11x\u00b2 - 720 = 11x\u00b2 - 120*6 = 11x\u00b2 - 120*6.\n\nWait, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps we can write both in terms of a common factor.\n\nWait, let me compute the expression:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * [120*(11x\u00b2 - 120)] / (11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nI can write this as:\n\n= 4 * 120 * (11x\u00b2 - 120) / (11x\u00b2 - 720)\n\n= 480 * (11x\u00b2 - 120) / (11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nNow, let me write this as:\n\n= 480 * [ (11x\u00b2 - 120) / (11x\u00b2 - 720) ]\n\n= 480 * [ (11x\u00b2 - 120) / (11x\u00b2 - 720) ]\n\nHmm, perhaps I can simplify this fraction.\n\nLet me denote t = 11x\u00b2.\n\nThen, the expression becomes:\n\n= 480 * (t - 120) / (t - 720).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480 * (t - 120)/(t - 720).\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n= 480 * [ (t - 120) / (t - 720) ]\n\n= 480 * [ (t - 720 + 600) / (t - 720) ]\n\n= 480 * [ 1 + 600/(t - 720) ]\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nt - 120 = (t - 720) + 600.\n\nYes, because (t - 720) + 600 = t - 120.\n\nSo,\n\n= 480 * [ (t - 720 + 600) / (t - 720) ]\n\n= 480 * [ 1 + 600/(t - 720) ]\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480 * [1 + 600/(t - 720)].\n\nNow, since t = 11x\u00b2, and we have from earlier that x\u00b2 > 720/11 \u2248 65.4545.\n\nSo, t = 11x\u00b2 > 720, so t - 720 > 0.\n\nThus, the denominator is positive, and 600/(t - 720) is positive.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is a function of t, where t > 720.\n\nWe can write BD\u00b2 as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480 + 480 * [600/(t - 720)].\n\nHmm, so BD\u00b2 is 480 plus a positive term. To minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize this expression.\n\nSince t > 720, as t approaches 720 from above, the term 600/(t - 720) approaches +infinity, making BD\u00b2 approach infinity.\n\nWait, that can't be right, because we're trying to find the minimum BD\u00b2, so perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.\n\nWait, let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake when factoring.\n\nWait, let me go back to the point where I expressed BD\u00b2 as 480*(11x\u00b2 - 120)/(11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nWait, maybe I should simplify this fraction differently.\n\nLet me compute (11x\u00b2 - 120)/(11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator.\n\nWait, 11x\u00b2 - 120 = 11x\u00b2 - 120,\n\n11x\u00b2 - 720 = 11x\u00b2 - 720.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor 11x\u00b2 - 720 as 11(x\u00b2) - 720, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe factor numerator and denominator as follows:\n\n(11x\u00b2 - 120) = 11x\u00b2 - 120,\n\n(11x\u00b2 - 720) = 11x\u00b2 - 720.\n\nHmm, perhaps write it as:\n\n= (11x\u00b2 - 120)/(11x\u00b2 - 720) = [11x\u00b2 - 720 + 600]/(11x\u00b2 - 720) = 1 + 600/(11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480 * [1 + 600/(11x\u00b2 - 720)].\n\nNow, as x\u00b2 increases beyond 720/11, the term 600/(11x\u00b2 - 720) decreases because the denominator increases.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is minimized when 600/(11x\u00b2 - 720) is minimized, which occurs when (11x\u00b2 - 720) is maximized. But since x\u00b2 can be any value greater than 720/11, the term 600/(11x\u00b2 - 720) approaches zero as x\u00b2 approaches infinity. Thus, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as x\u00b2 becomes very large.\n\nWait, but that suggests that the minimum value of BD\u00b2 is 480, approached as x\u00b2 approaches infinity. But that can't be correct because when x\u00b2 approaches infinity, point A would be very far along the hyperbola, and point B, being perpendicular, would also be far away, but their positions would adjust such that BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, let me go back to BD\u00b2 expression.\n\nWe had BD\u00b2 = 4*(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 4*(y\u00b2 k\u00b2 + x\u00b2 k\u00b2) = 4k\u00b2(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nBut from earlier, we have k\u00b2 = 600/(11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nAnd x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = (11x\u00b2)/5 - 24.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4*(600/(11x\u00b2 - 720)) * (11x\u00b2/5 - 24).\n\nLet me compute this expression step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (11x\u00b2/5 - 24):\n\n= (11x\u00b2 - 120)/5.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4*(600/(11x\u00b2 - 720)) * (11x\u00b2 - 120)/5\n\n= 4*(600*(11x\u00b2 - 120))/(5*(11x\u00b2 - 720)).\n\nSimplify:\n\n600 divided by 5 is 120,\n\nSo,\n\n= 4*(120*(11x\u00b2 - 120))/(11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\n= 480*(11x\u00b2 - 120)/(11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480*(11x\u00b2 - 120)/(11x\u00b2 - 720).\n\nLet me denote t = 11x\u00b2, so t > 720.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2 = 480*(t - 120)/(t - 720).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480*(t - 120)/(t - 720) = 480*( (t - 720) + 600 )/(t - 720) ) = 480*(1 + 600/(t - 720)).\n\nSo, as t increases beyond 720, the term 600/(t - 720) decreases towards zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480*1 = 480.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, but can it actually reach 480?\n\nWait, when t approaches infinity, 600/(t - 720) approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, but BD\u00b2 can't actually be less than 480, since as t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be 480, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, and can get arbitrarily close to 480.\n\nWait, but let me check if BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480.\n\nSuppose BD\u00b2 = 480.\n\nThen, 480 = 480*(1 + 600/(t - 720)).\n\nDivide both sides by 480:\n\n1 = 1 + 600/(t - 720).\n\nSubtract 1:\n\n0 = 600/(t - 720).\n\nWhich implies 600 = 0, which is impossible. So, BD\u00b2 can't be exactly 480, but can approach it as t approaches infinity.\n\nSo, the infimum is 480, meaning that BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but never less than 480.\n\nWait, but wait, let's test with specific points to see if BD\u00b2 can be less than 480.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps because I thought BD\u00b2 approaches 480, but maybe it's the other way around.\n\nWait, let's consider when x\u00b2 is just slightly larger than 720/11.\n\nLet me compute BD\u00b2 for x\u00b2 approaching 720/11 from above.\n\nWhen x\u00b2 approaches 720/11, t approaches 720, so t - 720 approaches zero from the positive side.\n\nSo, 600/(t - 720) approaches +infinity, making BD\u00b2 approach infinity.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is minimized when x\u00b2 is as large as possible, approaching infinity, leading BD\u00b2 to approach 480.\n\nSo, the minimal value that BD\u00b2 can approach is 480, but it can't be less than that.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, since BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because if BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480, then 480 is the infimum. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but let me test with specific points to see.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a specific rhombus where BD\u00b2 is exactly 480.\n\nWait, but from the earlier equation, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as x\u00b2 approaches infinity, but never actually reaches it. So, the infimum is 480, but BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check my earlier algebra again because I might have made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I can use Lagrange multipliers to minimize BD\u00b2 subject to the constraints.\n\nWe need to minimize BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2),\n\nsubject to:\n\n1. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\n2. xp + yq = 0,\n\nand x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nThis is a constrained optimization problem with multiple variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize points A and B in terms of an angle.\n\nWait, since OA and OB are perpendicular, perhaps I can consider points A and B as (x, y) and (-y, x), scaled appropriately to lie on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, but the hyperbola isn't a circle, so scaling might not preserve the hyperbola condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize points A and B such that OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nWait, let me consider that if OA and OB are perpendicular, then OB can be represented as a 90-degree rotation of OA, scaled by some factor.\n\nBut since the hyperbola isn't a circle, this might not directly apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that for any point A(x, y) on the hyperbola, point B can be taken as (k*(-y), k*x) for some k, ensuring that OA \u00b7 OB = 0.\n\nThen, B must lie on the hyperbola, so substituting into the hyperbola equation:\n\n(k*(-y))\u00b2/20 - (k*x)^2/24 = 1,\n\nwhich is (k\u00b2 y\u00b2)/20 - (k\u00b2 x\u00b2)/24 = 1,\n\nk\u00b2 (y\u00b2/20 - x\u00b2/24) = 1.\n\nBut from point A, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 \u21d2 y\u00b2/24 = x\u00b2/20 - 1 \u21d2 y\u00b2 = (24/20)x\u00b2 -24 = (6/5)x\u00b2 -24.\n\nSubstituting into the equation for B:\n\nk\u00b2 [ (6/5 x\u00b2 -24)/20 - x\u00b2/24 ] = 1.\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n= [ (6x\u00b2/5 -24)/20 - x\u00b2/24 ]\n\n= (6x\u00b2/(5*20)) - (24/20) - x\u00b2/24\n\n= (6x\u00b2/100) - (6/5) - x\u00b2/24\n\n= (3x\u00b2/50) - (6/5) - x\u00b2/24.\n\nFinding a common denominator, which is 600:\n\n= (36x\u00b2/600) - (720/600) - (25x\u00b2/600)\n\n= (36x\u00b2 -25x\u00b2 -720)/600\n\n= (11x\u00b2 -720)/600.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nk\u00b2 * (11x\u00b2 -720)/600 = 1 \u21d2 k\u00b2 = 600/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nThus, k\u00b2 must be positive, so 11x\u00b2 -720 > 0 \u21d2 x\u00b2 > 720/11 \u2248 65.4545.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 4(k\u00b2 y\u00b2 + k\u00b2 x\u00b2) = 4k\u00b2 (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nBut from point A, y\u00b2 = (6/5)x\u00b2 -24,\n\nso x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (6/5)x\u00b2 -24 = (11/5)x\u00b2 -24.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * [600/(11x\u00b2 -720)] * [ (11/5)x\u00b2 -24 ]\n\n= 4 * [600 * (11x\u00b2 - 120)/5 ] / (11x\u00b2 -720 )\n\n= 4 * [120*(11x\u00b2 -120)] / (11x\u00b2 -720 )\n\n= 480*(11x\u00b2 -120)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nWhich is the same expression as before.\n\nSo, this confirms that BD\u00b2 = 480*(11x\u00b2 -120)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nNow, to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2, we can analyze this function as x\u00b2 varies over values greater than 720/11.\n\nLet me let t = 11x\u00b2, so t > 720.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480*(t - 120)/(t - 720).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480*(t - 120)/(t - 720) = 480*( (t -720) + 600 )/(t -720) = 480*(1 + 600/(t -720)).\n\nSo, as t increases beyond 720, the term 600/(t -720) decreases, approaching zero. Thus, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above as t approaches infinity.\n\nSo, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 480, but it's not attainable. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me test with specific values to see if BD\u00b2 can be less than 480.\n\nWait, for example, take a very large x\u00b2, say x\u00b2 = 10^6. Then, t = 11*10^6 = 11,000,000.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480*(11,000,000 - 120)/(11,000,000 -720) \u2248 480*(11,000,000)/(11,000,000) = 480*(1) = 480.\n\nSo, as x\u00b2 increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut when x\u00b2 is just slightly larger than 720/11, say x\u00b2 = 720/11 + \u03b5, where \u03b5 is a small positive number, then t = 11x\u00b2 = 720 + 11\u03b5.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480*(720 +11\u03b5 -120)/(720 +11\u03b5 -720) = 480*(600 +11\u03b5)/(11\u03b5).\n\nAs \u03b5 approaches zero, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity, as expected.\n\nSo, indeed, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 from above, but never less than 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I initially thought about this, I thought the answer would be 480, but maybe I should verify.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps find the minimal value of BD\u00b2 by taking derivative with respect to x\u00b2 and finding the minimum.\n\nLet me consider BD\u00b2 as a function of t = 11x\u00b2, where t >720.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(t) = 480*(t -120)/(t -720).\n\nWe can find the derivative of BD\u00b2 with respect to t to find minima or maxima.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(t) = 480*(t -120)/(t -720).\n\nLet me compute d(BD\u00b2)/dt:\n\n= 480 * [ (1)(t -720) - (t -120)(1) ] / (t -720)^2\n\n= 480 * [ (t -720 - t + 120) ] / (t -720)^2\n\n= 480 * [ (-600) ] / (t -720)^2\n\n= -480*600 / (t -720)^2.\n\nSince t >720, the denominator is positive, and the numerator is negative, so d(BD\u00b2)/dt is negative.\n\nThis means that BD\u00b2 is a decreasing function of t. So, as t increases, BD\u00b2 decreases.\n\nWait, that's interesting because earlier, as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, and as t approaches 720 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 480, approached as t approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but since BD\u00b2 is a decreasing function of t, the minimal value is 480, and it's unbounded above.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought that BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as t increases. Wait, no, because as t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above, which would mean that 480 is the infimum.\n\nWait, but according to the derivative, since BD\u00b2 is decreasing, the minimal value is achieved as t approaches infinity, which is 480.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, but it's never actually reached, only approached.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the given hyperbola and the conditions for the rhombus. Points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) lie on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\), and their position vectors are perpendicular. Using these conditions, we derive the expression for \\( BD^2 \\) and find its infimum.\n\nThe infimum of \\( BD^2 \\) is found to be 480, which is the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombi.\n\n\\(\\boxed{480}\\)",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nThe hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, this is a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis length is 2\u221a20, which simplifies to 2*2\u221a5 = 4\u221a5. The conjugate axis is 2\u221a24, which is 4\u221a6. \n\nNow, the problem involves four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, but wait, no, actually, they bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. Hmm, yes, that's right. So the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if I consider points A and C as endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D as endpoints of the other diagonal, then the coordinates of A and C must be such that their midpoint is the origin. Similarly for B and D.\n\nSo, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y) because the midpoint is (0,0). Similarly, if B is (u, v), then D is (-u, -v). \n\nSo, the four points are A(x, y), B(u, v), C(-x, -y), D(-u, -v). \n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could be to consider the properties of the rhombus in terms of vectors. Since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, the position vectors of A and C are negatives of each other, same with B and D.\n\nBut maybe working with coordinates is better here.\n\nSo, let's consider the diagonals AC and BD. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes should be -1.\n\nLet me calculate the slopes. The slope of AC is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. Similarly, the slope of BD is (v - (-v))/(u - (-u)) = (2v)/(2u) = v/u.\n\nSince they are perpendicular, (y/x) * (v/u) = -1.\n\nSo, (yv)/(xu) = -1, which implies yv = -xu.\n\nSo, that's one condition.\n\nAnother thing I know is that all four points lie on the hyperbola. So, substituting each point into the hyperbola equation:\n\nFor A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nFor B: u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSimilarly for C and D, but since they are just the negatives, plugging in (-x, -y) gives the same equation as A, so they automatically satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nNow, I need to relate these points in such a way that ABCD is a rhombus. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, so the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, and so on.\n\nLet me write the distance formulas.\n\nDistance AB: sqrt[(u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2]\n\nDistance BC: sqrt[(-x - u)^2 + (-y - v)^2] = sqrt[( -x - u)^2 + (-y -v)^2] = sqrt[(x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2]\n\nSince AB = BC,\n\nsqrt[(u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2] = sqrt[(x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2 = (x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: u\u00b2 - 2ux + x\u00b2 + v\u00b2 - 2vy + y\u00b2\n\nRight side: x\u00b2 + 2ux + u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2vy + v\u00b2\n\nSubtracting right side from left side:\n\n(u\u00b2 - 2ux + x\u00b2 + v\u00b2 - 2vy + y\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + 2ux + u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2vy + v\u00b2) = 0\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nu\u00b2 - u\u00b2 = 0\n\nx\u00b2 - x\u00b2 = 0\n\nv\u00b2 - v\u00b2 = 0\n\ny\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 0\n\nThen, -2ux - 2ux = -4ux\n\n-2vy - 2vy = -4vy\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n-4ux -4vy = 0\n\nDivide both sides by -4:\n\nux + vy = 0\n\nSo, that's another condition: ux + vy = 0.\n\nEarlier, we had yv = -xu.\n\nWait, but yv = -xu is the same as ux + vy = 0. Because yv = -xu => ux + vy = 0. So, that's consistent. So, that condition is already captured by the perpendicularity of the diagonals. So, maybe the condition from the rhombus side equality is the same as the perpendicularity condition.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I need another condition.\n\nWait, maybe I should also consider that the diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular, which we have, but perhaps I need to use the fact that all sides are equal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parameterize the points on the hyperbola.\n\nSince hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, perhaps parametrize points on hyperbola using hyperbola functions. For hyperbola, a standard parametrization is (a sec \u03b8, b tan \u03b8), where a\u00b2 = 20, so a = 2\u221a5, and b\u00b2 = 24, so b = 2\u221a6.\n\nSo, point A can be written as (2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan \u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, point C would be (-2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan \u03b8), since it's the reflection through the origin.\n\nSimilarly, point B can be parametrized as (2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan \u03c6), and D would be (-2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, -2\u221a6 tan \u03c6).\n\nSo, points A, B, C, D are:\n\nA: (2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan \u03b8)\n\nB: (2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan \u03c6)\n\nC: (-2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan \u03b8)\n\nD: (-2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, -2\u221a6 tan \u03c6)\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to use vectors or to use the slopes.\n\nBut perhaps using the fact that the diagonals are perpendicular, and that the sides are equal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the coordinates to express vectors.\n\nThe vectors AB and AD should have the same length.\n\nWait, let's compute vectors AB and AD.\n\nVector AB = B - A = (2\u221a5 (sec \u03c6 - sec \u03b8), 2\u221a6 (tan \u03c6 - tan \u03b8))\n\nVector AD = D - A = (-2\u221a5 sec \u03c6 - 2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan \u03c6 - 2\u221a6 tan \u03b8)\n\nWait, that might get messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using slopes.\n\nWait, maybe another approach is better.\n\nSince diagonals are perpendicular, and midpoints at the origin, perhaps we can use coordinates such that the diagonals are along the coordinate axes, but that's only possible if the rhombus is a square, which it isn't necessarily.\n\nWait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily aligned with the coordinate axes, but in this case, the origin is the intersection point, but the diagonals could be at any angle.\n\nWait, maybe I can think in terms of parametric angles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinates for A and B such that vectors OA and OB are such that OA is (x, y), and OB is (u, v), with the conditions that OA \u00b7 OB = 0 (since diagonals are perpendicular), and OA and OB are points on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, OA and OB are position vectors of points A and B. If diagonals are perpendicular, then vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. Wait, AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y), and BD is from B to D, which is (-2u, -2v). So, the vectors AC and BD are (-2x, -2y) and (-2u, -2v). The dot product should be zero:\n\n(-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 4xu + 4yv = 0 => xu + yv = 0.\n\nWhich is the same condition as before. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the conditions we have are:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 (since A is on the hyperbola)\n\n2. u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1 (since B is on the hyperbola)\n\n3. xu + yv = 0 (from diagonals being perpendicular)\n\nAdditionally, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nLet me compute AB\u00b2 and BC\u00b2.\n\nAB\u00b2 = (u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2\n\nBC\u00b2 = (-x - u)^2 + (-y - v)^2 = (x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2\n\nSince AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2,\n\n(u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2 = (x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft: u\u00b2 - 2ux + x\u00b2 + v\u00b2 - 2vy + y\u00b2\n\nRight: x\u00b2 + 2ux + u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2vy + v\u00b2\n\nSubtracting right from left:\n\n-4ux -4vy = 0 => ux + vy = 0.\n\nWhich is condition 3, so that doesn't add any new information.\n\nSo, perhaps I need another condition from the rhombus.\n\nWait, in a rhombus, not only are the sides equal, but the adjacent sides are perpendicular? Wait, no, that's a square. No, in a rhombus, the adjacent sides are not necessarily perpendicular, only the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to consider the slopes of the sides.\n\nThe slope of AB is (v - y)/(u - x).\n\nThe slope of AD is (-v - y)/(-u - x) = (v + y)/(u + x).\n\nSince adjacent sides are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a rhombus, the sides are congruent but not necessarily at right angles.\n\nWait, maybe another approach is to use the fact that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and they bisect each other. So, perhaps using the properties of the diagonals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps parametrizing points A and B such that they satisfy the hyperbola equation and the condition xu + yv = 0.\n\nLet me consider points A and B on the hyperbola such that xu + yv = 0.\n\nLet me try to express one variable in terms of the others. For example, from xu + yv = 0, we can write v = -(xu)/y.\n\nBut since points A and B are on the hyperbola, their coordinates satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nSo, point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nPoint B: u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSubstituting v = -(xu)/y into point B's equation:\n\nu\u00b2/20 - [ (xu/y)^2 ] /24 = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\nu\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2u\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) = 1\n\nFactor out u\u00b2:\n\nu\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) ] = 1\n\nHmm, so that's an equation involving u\u00b2. Let me express this as:\n\nu\u00b2 [ (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2) / (24 * 20 y\u00b2) ) ] = 1\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2 = 4*(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)\n\nDenominator: 24 * 20 y\u00b2 = 480 y\u00b2\n\nSo, u\u00b2 [ (4*(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)) / (480 y\u00b2) ) ] = 1\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\n4 cancels with 480 to 120.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 [ (6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2) / (120 y\u00b2) ) ] = 1\n\nThus,\n\nu\u00b2 = 1 * (120 y\u00b2) / (6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)\n\nSo, u\u00b2 = (120 y\u00b2) / (6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)\n\nBut from point A's equation, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, so we can express x\u00b2 in terms of y\u00b2 or vice versa.\n\nLet me solve for x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 = 20 (1 + y\u00b2/24) = 20 + (20 y\u00b2)/24 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6\n\nSimilarly, let me plug this into the denominator of u\u00b2.\n\nDenominator: 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 = 6 y\u00b2 -5*(20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) = 6 y\u00b2 -100 - (25 y\u00b2)/6\n\nCombine terms:\n\nConvert 6 y\u00b2 to 36 y\u00b2/6:\n\n36 y\u00b2/6 -25 y\u00b2/6 = (11 y\u00b2)/6\n\nSo, denominator becomes (11 y\u00b2)/6 - 100\n\nSo, denominator: (11 y\u00b2 - 600)/6\n\nSo, u\u00b2 = (120 y\u00b2) / [ (11 y\u00b2 - 600)/6 ) ] = 120 y\u00b2 * (6)/(11 y\u00b2 -600) = (720 y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nSo, u\u00b2 = 720 y\u00b2 / (11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nBut u\u00b2 must be positive, so denominator and numerator must have the same sign.\n\nSo, 720 y\u00b2 is always positive (since y\u00b2 is non-negative). So, denominator must also be positive:\n\n11 y\u00b2 -600 > 0 => y\u00b2 > 600/11 \u224854.545\n\nSo, y\u00b2 > 600/11\n\nSimilarly, since point A is on hyperbola, y\u00b2 must satisfy y\u00b2 = (24/20)x\u00b2 -24*1 = (6/5)x\u00b2 -24.\n\nWait, earlier, we had x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6\n\nSo, substituting back, y\u00b2 = (6/5)x\u00b2 -24\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 => x\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6)( (6/5)x\u00b2 -24 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6)(6x\u00b2/5 -24) = 20 + ( (5/6)(6x\u00b2/5) ) - (5/6)*24\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n(5/6)(6x\u00b2/5) = x\u00b2\n\n(5/6)*24 = 20\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + x\u00b2 -20\n\nWhich simplifies to x\u00b2 = x\u00b2, which is a tautology, so no new information.\n\nSo, perhaps we can proceed by expressing u in terms of y.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 = 720 y\u00b2 / (11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nSimilarly, from point A, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6\n\nSo, x = sqrt(20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 )\n\nBut perhaps we can find a relationship between u and y.\n\nWait, but since we're trying to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD.\n\nDiagonal BD is from B(u, v) to D(-u, -v), so its length is sqrt[ (-u -u)^2 + (-v -v)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-2u)^2 + (-2v)^2 ] = sqrt[4u\u00b2 +4v\u00b2] = 2 sqrt(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = [2 sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)]\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)\n\nSo, we need to find BD\u00b2 =4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). Our goal is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, which I think means we need to find the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2. Wait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" Hmm, so we're looking for the supremum (least upper bound) of BD\u00b2? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because it's the greatest lower bound. Because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is greater than this number, and this number is the largest such.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, for every rhombus, BD\u00b2 is greater than this number, and this number is the largest possible. So, that is the infimum of BD\u00b2. So, we're looking for the minimal possible BD\u00b2, because the greatest lower bound would be the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but wait, if we can find the minimal BD\u00b2, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the minimal BD\u00b2. Because for every rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least minimal BD\u00b2, so the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is the minimal BD\u00b2 itself. Wait, but if BD\u00b2 can be equal to the minimal value, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be just below that minimal BD\u00b2. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should instead find the minimal possible value of BD\u00b2, and then the answer would be that minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Let me proceed.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2). So, to find BD\u00b2, I need to find u\u00b2 +v\u00b2.\n\nFrom point B, we have u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 =1. So, let's solve for v\u00b2:\n\nv\u00b2 =24(u\u00b2/20 -1) = (24/20)u\u00b2 -24 = (6/5)u\u00b2 -24\n\nSo, v\u00b2 = (6/5)u\u00b2 -24\n\nSo, u\u00b2 +v\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + (6/5)u\u00b2 -24 = (11/5)u\u00b2 -24\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4*( (11/5)u\u00b2 -24 ) = (44/5)u\u00b2 -96\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (44/5)u\u00b2 -96\n\nSo, to find BD\u00b2, we can express it in terms of u\u00b2.\n\nBut we also have from earlier:\n\nu\u00b2 =720 y\u00b2/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nSo, substituting this into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 = (44/5)*(720 y\u00b2/(11 y\u00b2 -600)) -96\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, compute (44/5)*(720 y\u00b2/(11 y\u00b2 -600)):\n\n44/5 *720 = (44*720)/5 = (44*144) = 6336\n\nSo, 6336 y\u00b2/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 6336 y\u00b2/(11 y\u00b2 -600) -96\n\nHmm, now, let me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = [6336 y\u00b2 -96*(11 y\u00b2 -600)] / (11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n6336 y\u00b2 -96*(11 y\u00b2 -600) =6336 y\u00b2 - 1056 y\u00b2 +57,600\n\n= (6336 -1056) y\u00b2 +57,600 =5280 y\u00b2 +57,600\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (5280 y\u00b2 +57,600)/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: 5280 y\u00b2 +57,600 = 5280(y\u00b2 + 57600/5280 )\n\nWait, 57600/5280 = 57600 \u00f7 5280 = 11. (Wait, 5280 *11=58,080, which is more than 57,600. Hmm, perhaps I should factor out 240.)\n\nWait, 5280 = 240*22, and 57,600 = 240*240.\n\nWait, 5280 y\u00b2 +57,600 =240*(22 y\u00b2 +240)\n\nSimilarly, denominator:11 y\u00b2 -600.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = [240*(22 y\u00b2 +240)] / (11 y\u00b2 -600 )\n\nHmm, perhaps we can factor further.\n\nWait, 22 y\u00b2 +240 = 2*(11 y\u00b2 +120)\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = [240*2*(11 y\u00b2 +120)] / (11 y\u00b2 -600) =480*(11 y\u00b2 +120)/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =480*(11 y\u00b2 +120)/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nLet me set t =11 y\u00b2 -600, which is positive because earlier we had y\u00b2 >600/11 \u224854.545.\n\nSo, t>0.\n\nThen, 11 y\u00b2 = t +600\n\nSo, 11 y\u00b2 +120 = t +600 +120 = t +720\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(t +720)/t =480*(1 +720/t )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480 + (480*720)/t\n\nSince t>0, and t =11 y\u00b2 -600, which is positive.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480 + (345600)/t\n\nSince t>0, the term 345600/t is positive, so BD\u00b2 is greater than 480.\n\nBut wait, as t approaches infinity, 345600/t approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nBut t can't be larger than any number, but as y\u00b2 increases, t increases, so 345600/t decreases, making BD\u00b2 approach 480.\n\nSo, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 480, approached as y\u00b2 becomes very large. But since t must be positive, and y\u00b2 must be greater than 600/11, which is about 54.545.\n\nWait, but can BD\u00b2 actually attain 480? Because as t approaches infinity, y\u00b2 approaches infinity, which would require A and B to be points at infinity on the hyperbola, which isn't practical.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 but cannot be less than 480.\n\nSo, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but let me check if BD\u00b2 can indeed be equal to 480.\n\nWait, from BD\u00b2=480 +345600/t, for BD\u00b2=480, we would need 345600/t=0, which implies t approaches infinity, which implies y\u00b2 approaches infinity. So, BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, but never actually reaches 480.\n\nSo, 480 is the infimum of BD\u00b2, meaning that BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 but never less than 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480, because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is greater than 480, and 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another approach to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so the answer is 480.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check the calculations again.\n\nStarting from BD\u00b2 =4(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2)\n\nFrom point B: u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24=1 => v\u00b2= (6/5)u\u00b2 -24\n\nSo, u\u00b2 +v\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + (6/5)u\u00b2 -24 = (11/5)u\u00b2 -24\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(11/5 u\u00b2 -24 )= (44/5)u\u00b2 -96\n\nEarlier, I found u\u00b2=720 y\u00b2/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nSubstituting into BD\u00b2:\n\n(44/5)*(720 y\u00b2/(11 y\u00b2 -600)) -96\n\n= (44*720 y\u00b2)/(5*(11 y\u00b2 -600)) -96\n\nCompute 44*720: 44*700=30,800; 44*20=880 \u2192 total 31,680\n\nSo, 31,680 y\u00b2/(5*(11 y\u00b2 -600)) -96\n\n= 6,336 y\u00b2/(11 y\u00b2 -600) -96\n\nNow, writing as a single fraction:\n\n[6,336 y\u00b2 -96*(11 y\u00b2 -600)] / (11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n6,336 y\u00b2 -1,056 y\u00b2 +57,600 = (6,336 -1,056)y\u00b2 +57,600 =5,280 y\u00b2 +57,600\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=(5,280 y\u00b2 +57,600)/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n5,280 y\u00b2 +57,600 =5,280(y\u00b2 + 11) \u2192 Wait, no. Wait, 5,280 y\u00b2 +57,600 = 5,280*(y\u00b2 + (57,600/5,280))=5,280*(y\u00b2 + 11. (Wait, 57,600 \u00f75,280 is 11. So, yes, 5,280*(y\u00b2 +11 )\n\nWait, 5,280*11=58,080, but 57,600 is less than that. So perhaps I made a mistake in factoring.\n\nWait, 5,280 y\u00b2 +57,600 =5,280*(y\u00b2 + (57,600/5,280)).\n\nCompute 57,600 \u00f75,280:\n\n5,280 *10=52,800\n\n57,600 -52,800=4,800\n\n5,280*0.9=4,752\n\n4,800-4,752=48\n\n5,280*0.009\u224847.52\n\nSo, approximately, 10 +0.9 +0.009\u224810.909\n\nWait, perhaps exact fraction.\n\n57,600 \u00f75,280 = (57,600 \u00f7 240) \u00f7 (5,280 \u00f7240) =240 \u00f722 =120/11 \u224810.909\n\nSo, 57,600/5,280=120/11\n\nSo, 5,280 y\u00b2 +57,600 =5,280*(y\u00b2 + 120/11 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=5,280*(y\u00b2 + 120/11 )/(11 y\u00b2 -600 )\n\nFactor denominator:11 y\u00b2 -600 =11(y\u00b2 -600/11 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=5,280*(y\u00b2 + 120/11 )/(11(y\u00b2 -600/11 )) = (5,280/11)*(y\u00b2 +120/11)/(y\u00b2 -600/11 )\n\nSimplify 5,280/11=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(y\u00b2 +120/11)/(y\u00b2 -600/11 )\n\nLet me set z=y\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(z +120/11)/(z -600/11 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: z +120/11 = (11 z +120)/11\n\nDenominator: z -600/11 = (11 z -600)/11\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=480*( (11 z +120)/11 ) / ( (11 z -600)/11 ) ) =480*(11 z +120)/(11 z -600 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(11 z +120)/(11 z -600 )\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11 z +120)/(11 z -600 )=480*( (11 z -600) +720 )/(11 z -600 )\n\n=480*[1 +720/(11 z -600 ) ]\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480 + (480*720)/(11 z -600 )\n\nBut z=y\u00b2 >600/11, so 11 z -600>0, so denominator is positive.\n\nThus, as z approaches infinity, 720/(11 z -600 ) approaches 0, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, but can't be less than 480.\n\nHence, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is 480, which is the infimum. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nThe hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, this is a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis length is 2\u221a20, which simplifies to 2*2\u221a5 = 4\u221a5. The conjugate axis is 2\u221a24, which is 4\u221a6. \n\nNow, the problem involves four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, but wait, no, actually, they bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. Hmm, yes, that's right. So the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if I consider points A and C as endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D as endpoints of the other diagonal, then the coordinates of A and C must be such that their midpoint is the origin. Similarly for B and D.\n\nSo, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y) because the midpoint is (0,0). Similarly, if B is (u, v), then D is (-u, -v). \n\nSo, the four points are A(x, y), B(u, v), C(-x, -y), D(-u, -v). \n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could be to consider the properties of the rhombus in terms of vectors. Since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, the position vectors of A and C are negatives of each other, same with B and D.\n\nBut maybe working with coordinates is better here.\n\nSo, let's consider the diagonals AC and BD. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes should be -1.\n\nLet me calculate the slopes. The slope of AC is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. Similarly, the slope of BD is (v - (-v))/(u - (-u)) = (2v)/(2u) = v/u.\n\nSince they are perpendicular, (y/x) * (v/u) = -1.\n\nSo, (yv)/(xu) = -1, which implies yv = -xu.\n\nSo, that's one condition.\n\nAnother thing I know is that all four points lie on the hyperbola. So, substituting each point into the hyperbola equation:\n\nFor A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nFor B: u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSimilarly for C and D, but since they are just the negatives, plugging in (-x, -y) gives the same equation as A, so they automatically satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nNow, I need to relate these points in such a way that ABCD is a rhombus. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, so the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, and so on.\n\nLet me write the distance formulas.\n\nDistance AB: sqrt[(u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2]\n\nDistance BC: sqrt[(-x - u)^2 + (-y - v)^2] = sqrt[( -x - u)^2 + (-y -v)^2] = sqrt[(x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2]\n\nSince AB = BC,\n\nsqrt[(u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2] = sqrt[(x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2 = (x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: u\u00b2 - 2ux + x\u00b2 + v\u00b2 - 2vy + y\u00b2\n\nRight side: x\u00b2 + 2ux + u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2vy + v\u00b2\n\nSubtracting right side from left side:\n\n(u\u00b2 - 2ux + x\u00b2 + v\u00b2 - 2vy + y\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + 2ux + u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2vy + v\u00b2) = 0\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nu\u00b2 - u\u00b2 = 0\n\nx\u00b2 - x\u00b2 = 0\n\nv\u00b2 - v\u00b2 = 0\n\ny\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 0\n\nThen, -2ux - 2ux = -4ux\n\n-2vy - 2vy = -4vy\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n-4ux -4vy = 0\n\nDivide both sides by -4:\n\nux + vy = 0\n\nSo, that's another condition: ux + vy = 0.\n\nEarlier, we had yv = -xu.\n\nWait, but yv = -xu is the same as ux + vy = 0. Because yv = -xu => ux + vy = 0. So, that's consistent. So, that condition is already captured by the perpendicularity of the diagonals. So, maybe the condition from the rhombus side equality is the same as the perpendicularity condition.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I need another condition.\n\nWait, maybe I should also consider that the diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular, which we have, but perhaps I need to use the fact that all sides are equal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parameterize the points on the hyperbola.\n\nSince hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, perhaps parametrize points on hyperbola using hyperbola functions. For hyperbola, a standard parametrization is (a sec \u03b8, b tan \u03b8), where a\u00b2 = 20, so a = 2\u221a5, and b\u00b2 = 24, so b = 2\u221a6.\n\nSo, point A can be written as (2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan \u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, point C would be (-2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan \u03b8), since it's the reflection through the origin.\n\nSimilarly, point B can be parametrized as (2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan \u03c6), and D would be (-2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, -2\u221a6 tan \u03c6).\n\nSo, points A, B, C, D are:\n\nA: (2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan \u03b8)\n\nB: (2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan \u03c6)\n\nC: (-2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan \u03b8)\n\nD: (-2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, -2\u221a6 tan \u03c6)\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to use vectors or to use the slopes.\n\nBut perhaps using the fact that the diagonals are perpendicular, and that the sides are equal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the coordinates to express vectors.\n\nThe vectors AB and AD should have the same length.\n\nWait, let's compute vectors AB and AD.\n\nVector AB = B - A = (2\u221a5 (sec \u03c6 - sec \u03b8), 2\u221a6 (tan \u03c6 - tan \u03b8))\n\nVector AD = D - A = (-2\u221a5 sec \u03c6 - 2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan \u03c6 - 2\u221a6 tan \u03b8)\n\nWait, that might get messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using slopes.\n\nWait, maybe another approach is better.\n\nSince diagonals are perpendicular, and midpoints at the origin, perhaps we can use coordinates such that the diagonals are along the coordinate axes, but that's only possible if the rhombus is a square, which it isn't necessarily.\n\nWait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily aligned with the coordinate axes, but in this case, the origin is the intersection point, but the diagonals could be at any angle.\n\nWait, maybe I can think in terms of parametric angles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinates for A and B such that vectors OA and OB are such that OA is (x, y), and OB is (u, v), with the conditions that OA \u00b7 OB = 0 (since diagonals are perpendicular), and OA and OB are points on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, OA and OB are position vectors of points A and B. If diagonals are perpendicular, then vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. Wait, AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y), and BD is from B to D, which is (-2u, -2v). So, the vectors AC and BD are (-2x, -2y) and (-2u, -2v). The dot product should be zero:\n\n(-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 4xu + 4yv = 0 => xu + yv = 0.\n\nWhich is the same condition as before. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the conditions we have are:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 (since A is on the hyperbola)\n\n2. u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1 (since B is on the hyperbola)\n\n3. xu + yv = 0 (from diagonals being perpendicular)\n\nAdditionally, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nLet me compute AB\u00b2 and BC\u00b2.\n\nAB\u00b2 = (u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2\n\nBC\u00b2 = (-x - u)^2 + (-y - v)^2 = (x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2\n\nSince AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2,\n\n(u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2 = (x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft: u\u00b2 - 2ux + x\u00b2 + v\u00b2 - 2vy + y\u00b2\n\nRight: x\u00b2 + 2ux + u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2vy + v\u00b2\n\nSubtracting right from left:\n\n-4ux -4vy = 0 => ux + vy = 0.\n\nWhich is condition 3, so that doesn't add any new information.\n\nSo, perhaps I need another condition from the rhombus.\n\nWait, in a rhombus, not only are the sides equal, but the adjacent sides are perpendicular? Wait, no, that's a square. No, in a rhombus, the adjacent sides are not necessarily perpendicular, only the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to consider the slopes of the sides.\n\nThe slope of AB is (v - y)/(u - x).\n\nThe slope of AD is (-v - y)/(-u - x) = (v + y)/(u + x).\n\nSince adjacent sides are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a rhombus, the sides are congruent but not necessarily at right angles.\n\nWait, maybe another approach is to use the fact that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and they bisect each other. So, perhaps using the properties of the diagonals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps parametrizing points A and B such that they satisfy the hyperbola equation and the condition xu + yv = 0.\n\nLet me consider points A and B on the hyperbola such that xu + yv = 0.\n\nLet me try to express one variable in terms of the others. For example, from xu + yv = 0, we can write v = -(xu)/y.\n\nBut since points A and B are on the hyperbola, their coordinates satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nSo, point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nPoint B: u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSubstituting v = -(xu)/y into point B's equation:\n\nu\u00b2/20 - [ (xu/y)^2 ] /24 = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\nu\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2u\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) = 1\n\nFactor out u\u00b2:\n\nu\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) ] = 1\n\nHmm, so that's an equation involving u\u00b2. Let me express this as:\n\nu\u00b2 [ (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2) / (24 * 20 y\u00b2) ) ] = 1\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2 = 4*(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)\n\nDenominator: 24 * 20 y\u00b2 = 480 y\u00b2\n\nSo, u\u00b2 [ (4*(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)) / (480 y\u00b2) ) ] = 1\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\n4 cancels with 480 to 120.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 [ (6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2) / (120 y\u00b2) ) ] = 1\n\nThus,\n\nu\u00b2 = 1 * (120 y\u00b2) / (6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)\n\nSo, u\u00b2 = (120 y\u00b2) / (6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)\n\nBut from point A's equation, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, so we can express x\u00b2 in terms of y\u00b2 or vice versa.\n\nLet me solve for x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 = 20 (1 + y\u00b2/24) = 20 + (20 y\u00b2)/24 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6\n\nSimilarly, let me plug this into the denominator of u\u00b2.\n\nDenominator: 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 = 6 y\u00b2 -5*(20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) = 6 y\u00b2 -100 - (25 y\u00b2)/6\n\nCombine terms:\n\nConvert 6 y\u00b2 to 36 y\u00b2/6:\n\n36 y\u00b2/6 -25 y\u00b2/6 = (11 y\u00b2)/6\n\nSo, denominator becomes (11 y\u00b2)/6 - 100\n\nSo, denominator: (11 y\u00b2 - 600)/6\n\nSo, u\u00b2 = (120 y\u00b2) / [ (11 y\u00b2 - 600)/6 ) ] = 120 y\u00b2 * (6)/(11 y\u00b2 -600) = (720 y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nSo, u\u00b2 = 720 y\u00b2 / (11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nBut u\u00b2 must be positive, so denominator and numerator must have the same sign.\n\nSo, 720 y\u00b2 is always positive (since y\u00b2 is non-negative). So, denominator must also be positive:\n\n11 y\u00b2 -600 > 0 => y\u00b2 > 600/11 \u224854.545\n\nSo, y\u00b2 > 600/11\n\nSimilarly, since point A is on hyperbola, y\u00b2 must satisfy y\u00b2 = (24/20)x\u00b2 -24*1 = (6/5)x\u00b2 -24.\n\nWait, earlier, we had x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6\n\nSo, substituting back, y\u00b2 = (6/5)x\u00b2 -24\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 => x\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6)( (6/5)x\u00b2 -24 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6)(6x\u00b2/5 -24) = 20 + ( (5/6)(6x\u00b2/5) ) - (5/6)*24\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n(5/6)(6x\u00b2/5) = x\u00b2\n\n(5/6)*24 = 20\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + x\u00b2 -20\n\nWhich simplifies to x\u00b2 = x\u00b2, which is a tautology, so no new information.\n\nSo, perhaps we can proceed by expressing u in terms of y.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 = 720 y\u00b2 / (11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nSimilarly, from point A, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6\n\nSo, x = sqrt(20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 )\n\nBut perhaps we can find a relationship between u and y.\n\nWait, but since we're trying to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD.\n\nDiagonal BD is from B(u, v) to D(-u, -v), so its length is sqrt[ (-u -u)^2 + (-v -v)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-2u)^2 + (-2v)^2 ] = sqrt[4u\u00b2 +4v\u00b2] = 2 sqrt(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = [2 sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)]\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)\n\nSo, we need to find BD\u00b2 =4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). Our goal is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, which I think means we need to find the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2. Wait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" Hmm, so we're looking for the supremum (least upper bound) of BD\u00b2? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because it's the greatest lower bound. Because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is greater than this number, and this number is the largest such.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, for every rhombus, BD\u00b2 is greater than this number, and this number is the largest possible. So, that is the infimum of BD\u00b2. So, we're looking for the minimal possible BD\u00b2, because the greatest lower bound would be the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but wait, if we can find the minimal BD\u00b2, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the minimal BD\u00b2. Because for every rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least minimal BD\u00b2, so the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is the minimal BD\u00b2 itself. Wait, but if BD\u00b2 can be equal to the minimal value, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be just below that minimal BD\u00b2. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should instead find the minimal possible value of BD\u00b2, and then the answer would be that minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Let me proceed.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2). So, to find BD\u00b2, I need to find u\u00b2 +v\u00b2.\n\nFrom point B, we have u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 =1. So, let's solve for v\u00b2:\n\nv\u00b2 =24(u\u00b2/20 -1) = (24/20)u\u00b2 -24 = (6/5)u\u00b2 -24\n\nSo, v\u00b2 = (6/5)u\u00b2 -24\n\nSo, u\u00b2 +v\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + (6/5)u\u00b2 -24 = (11/5)u\u00b2 -24\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4*( (11/5)u\u00b2 -24 ) = (44/5)u\u00b2 -96\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (44/5)u\u00b2 -96\n\nSo, to find BD\u00b2, we can express it in terms of u\u00b2.\n\nBut we also have from earlier:\n\nu\u00b2 =720 y\u00b2/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nSo, substituting this into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 = (44/5)*(720 y\u00b2/(11 y\u00b2 -600)) -96\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, compute (44/5)*(720 y\u00b2/(11 y\u00b2 -600)):\n\n44/5 *720 = (44*720)/5 = (44*144) = 6336\n\nSo, 6336 y\u00b2/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 6336 y\u00b2/(11 y\u00b2 -600) -96\n\nHmm, now, let me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = [6336 y\u00b2 -96*(11 y\u00b2 -600)] / (11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n6336 y\u00b2 -96*(11 y\u00b2 -600) =6336 y\u00b2 - 1056 y\u00b2 +57,600\n\n= (6336 -1056) y\u00b2 +57,600 =5280 y\u00b2 +57,600\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (5280 y\u00b2 +57,600)/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: 5280 y\u00b2 +57,600 = 5280(y\u00b2 + 57600/5280 )\n\nWait, 57600/5280 = 57600 \u00f7 5280 = 11. (Wait, 5280 *11=58,080, which is more than 57,600. Hmm, perhaps I should factor out 240.)\n\nWait, 5280 = 240*22, and 57,600 = 240*240.\n\nWait, 5280 y\u00b2 +57,600 =240*(22 y\u00b2 +240)\n\nSimilarly, denominator:11 y\u00b2 -600.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = [240*(22 y\u00b2 +240)] / (11 y\u00b2 -600 )\n\nHmm, perhaps we can factor further.\n\nWait, 22 y\u00b2 +240 = 2*(11 y\u00b2 +120)\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = [240*2*(11 y\u00b2 +120)] / (11 y\u00b2 -600) =480*(11 y\u00b2 +120)/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =480*(11 y\u00b2 +120)/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nLet me set t =11 y\u00b2 -600, which is positive because earlier we had y\u00b2 >600/11 \u224854.545.\n\nSo, t>0.\n\nThen, 11 y\u00b2 = t +600\n\nSo, 11 y\u00b2 +120 = t +600 +120 = t +720\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(t +720)/t =480*(1 +720/t )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480 + (480*720)/t\n\nSince t>0, and t =11 y\u00b2 -600, which is positive.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480 + (345600)/t\n\nSince t>0, the term 345600/t is positive, so BD\u00b2 is greater than 480.\n\nBut wait, as t approaches infinity, 345600/t approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nBut t can't be larger than any number, but as y\u00b2 increases, t increases, so 345600/t decreases, making BD\u00b2 approach 480.\n\nSo, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 480, approached as y\u00b2 becomes very large. But since t must be positive, and y\u00b2 must be greater than 600/11, which is about 54.545.\n\nWait, but can BD\u00b2 actually attain 480? Because as t approaches infinity, y\u00b2 approaches infinity, which would require A and B to be points at infinity on the hyperbola, which isn't practical.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 but cannot be less than 480.\n\nSo, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but let me check if BD\u00b2 can indeed be equal to 480.\n\nWait, from BD\u00b2=480 +345600/t, for BD\u00b2=480, we would need 345600/t=0, which implies t approaches infinity, which implies y\u00b2 approaches infinity. So, BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, but never actually reaches 480.\n\nSo, 480 is the infimum of BD\u00b2, meaning that BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 but never less than 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480, because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is greater than 480, and 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another approach to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so the answer is 480.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check the calculations again.\n\nStarting from BD\u00b2 =4(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2)\n\nFrom point B: u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24=1 => v\u00b2= (6/5)u\u00b2 -24\n\nSo, u\u00b2 +v\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + (6/5)u\u00b2 -24 = (11/5)u\u00b2 -24\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(11/5 u\u00b2 -24 )= (44/5)u\u00b2 -96\n\nEarlier, I found u\u00b2=720 y\u00b2/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nSubstituting into BD\u00b2:\n\n(44/5)*(720 y\u00b2/(11 y\u00b2 -600)) -96\n\n= (44*720 y\u00b2)/(5*(11 y\u00b2 -600)) -96\n\nCompute 44*720: 44*700=30,800; 44*20=880 \u2192 total 31,680\n\nSo, 31,680 y\u00b2/(5*(11 y\u00b2 -600)) -96\n\n= 6,336 y\u00b2/(11 y\u00b2 -600) -96\n\nNow, writing as a single fraction:\n\n[6,336 y\u00b2 -96*(11 y\u00b2 -600)] / (11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n6,336 y\u00b2 -1,056 y\u00b2 +57,600 = (6,336 -1,056)y\u00b2 +57,600 =5,280 y\u00b2 +57,600\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=(5,280 y\u00b2 +57,600)/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n5,280 y\u00b2 +57,600 =5,280(y\u00b2 + 11) \u2192 Wait, no. Wait, 5,280 y\u00b2 +57,600 = 5,280*(y\u00b2 + (57,600/5,280))=5,280*(y\u00b2 + 11. (Wait, 57,600 \u00f75,280 is 11. So, yes, 5,280*(y\u00b2 +11 )\n\nWait, 5,280*11=58,080, but 57,600 is less than that. So perhaps I made a mistake in factoring.\n\nWait, 5,280 y\u00b2 +57,600 =5,280*(y\u00b2 + (57,600/5,280)).\n\nCompute 57,600 \u00f75,280:\n\n5,280 *10=52,800\n\n57,600 -52,800=4,800\n\n5,280*0.9=4,752\n\n4,800-4,752=48\n\n5,280*0.009\u224847.52\n\nSo, approximately, 10 +0.9 +0.009\u224810.909\n\nWait, perhaps exact fraction.\n\n57,600 \u00f75,280 = (57,600 \u00f7 240) \u00f7 (5,280 \u00f7240) =240 \u00f722 =120/11 \u224810.909\n\nSo, 57,600/5,280=120/11\n\nSo, 5,280 y\u00b2 +57,600 =5,280*(y\u00b2 + 120/11 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=5,280*(y\u00b2 + 120/11 )/(11 y\u00b2 -600 )\n\nFactor denominator:11 y\u00b2 -600 =11(y\u00b2 -600/11 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=5,280*(y\u00b2 + 120/11 )/(11(y\u00b2 -600/11 )) = (5,280/11)*(y\u00b2 +120/11)/(y\u00b2 -600/11 )\n\nSimplify 5,280/11=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(y\u00b2 +120/11)/(y\u00b2 -600/11 )\n\nLet me set z=y\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(z +120/11)/(z -600/11 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: z +120/11 = (11 z +120)/11\n\nDenominator: z -600/11 = (11 z -600)/11\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=480*( (11 z +120)/11 ) / ( (11 z -600)/11 ) ) =480*(11 z +120)/(11 z -600 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(11 z +120)/(11 z -600 )\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11 z +120)/(11 z -600 )=480*( (11 z -600) +720 )/(11 z -600 )\n\n=480*[1 +720/(11 z -600 ) ]\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480 + (480*720)/(11 z -600 )\n\nBut z=y\u00b2 >600/11, so 11 z -600>0, so denominator is positive.\n\nThus, as z approaches infinity, 720/(11 z -600 ) approaches 0, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, but can't be less than 480.\n\nHence, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is 480, which is the infimum. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the hyperbola is given by \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\) and that the rhombus \\(ABCD\\) has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, implying that the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. \n\nWe parameterize the points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) on the hyperbola using hyperbolic functions. Let \\(A = (2\\sqrt{5} \\sec \\theta, 2\\sqrt{6} \\tan \\theta)\\) and \\(B = (2\\sqrt{5} \\sec \\phi, 2\\sqrt{6} \\tan \\phi)\\). The condition that the diagonals are perpendicular leads to the equation \\(xu + yv = 0\\), where \\(A = (x, y)\\) and \\(B = (u, v)\\).\n\nUsing the hyperbola equation for points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), we express \\(u^2\\) and \\(v^2\\) in terms of \\(y^2\\). Substituting these into the expression for \\(BD^2\\), we find:\n\n\\[\nBD^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2)\n\\]\n\nThrough algebraic manipulation and substitution, we express \\(BD^2\\) in terms of \\(y^2\\) and find that:\n\n\\[\nBD^2 = 480 + \\frac{345600}{11y^2 - 600}\n\\]\n\nAs \\(y^2\\) approaches infinity, the term \\(\\frac{345600}{11y^2 - 600}\\) approaches zero, making \\(BD^2\\) approach 480. Thus, the minimal possible value of \\(BD^2\\) is 480, and the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{480}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. The hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. The rhombus is named ABCD, and its diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals do bisect the angles and are perpendicular. Yes, I think that's right. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's an important point.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the rhombus is symmetric with respect to the origin. So, points A, B, C, D must be arranged such that they are symmetric with respect to the origin.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points must be in such a way that if one point is (x, y), the opposite point is (-x, -y). So, for example, if A is (x, y), then C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D would be (-p, -q). So, the four points of the rhombus are (x, y), (p, q), (-x, -y), (-p, -q).\n\nBut wait, since it's a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B must be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to parametrize the points on the hyperbola and then use the properties of the rhombus to find relationships between them.\n\nSo, the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, any point on this hyperbola can be represented parametrically. For hyperbolas, the standard parametrization is (a sec \u03b8, b tan \u03b8), where a\u00b2 = 20 and b\u00b2 = 24. So, a = sqrt(20), which is 2*sqrt(5), and b = sqrt(24), which is 2*sqrt(6).\n\nSo, points on the hyperbola can be written as (2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan \u03b8). Alternatively, sometimes hyperbola parametrization is done using hyperbolic functions: (a cosh t, b sinh t). But maybe the trigonometric parametrization is easier here.\n\nWait, but hyperbola parametrization using trigonometric functions isn't as straightforward because hyperbola isn't periodic like circles. So, maybe the hyperbolic functions are better for parametrization.\n\nWait, I think the standard parametrization for hyperbola is indeed (a cosh t, b sinh t), since cosh\u00b2 t - sinh\u00b2 t = 1, so when you divide by a\u00b2 and b\u00b2, it gives the hyperbola equation.\n\nSo, perhaps using hyperbolic functions might be better here. So, let's denote the points as:\n\nA: (a cosh t, b sinh t)\n\nC: (-a cosh t, -b sinh t)\n\nSimilarly, points B and D would be another pair symmetric about the origin.\n\nBut since it's a rhombus, the sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, etc.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, AC is from (a cosh t, b sinh t) to (-a cosh t, -b sinh t), so the length of AC is 2a cosh t and 2b sinh t in each direction, but wait, actually, the distance between A and C is sqrt[(2a cosh t)^2 + (2b sinh t)^2], which would be the length of diagonal AC.\n\nSimilarly, BD would be the other diagonal, but since B and D are symmetric about the origin, their coordinates are (p, q) and (-p, -q). So, the length of BD is sqrt[(2p)^2 + (2q)^2] = 2 sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nBut both points B and D must lie on the hyperbola. So, p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, the diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD. Now, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular to each other. So, the product of their slopes should be -1.\n\nWait, let's think about that. The diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.\n\nSo, the slope of AC is (from A to C): ( -b sinh t - b sinh t ) / ( -a cosh t - a cosh t ) = (-2b sinh t)/(-2a cosh t) = (b/a) tanh t.\n\nSimilarly, the slope of BD would be (from B to D): (-q - q)/(-p - p) = (-2q)/(-2p) = q/p.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nSo, (b/a) tanh t * (q/p) = -1.\n\nSo, (b q)/(a p) tanh t = -1.\n\nBut I also know that points B and D are on the hyperbola, so p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAdditionally, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, etc.\n\nWait, but maybe another approach is better. Let me consider vectors.\n\nLet me denote vectors OA = (a cosh t, b sinh t), and OB = (p, q). Since ABCD is a rhombus, the vectors OA and OB must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nIn a rhombus, the adjacent sides are vectors that have the same magnitude and their sum and difference give the diagonals.\n\nWait, so in a rhombus, if O is the intersection point of the diagonals, then the vectors from O to the vertices are such that OA and OB are two adjacent vertices, but wait, no, in this case, O is the origin, and the diagonals intersect at O, so the vertices are OA, OB, -OA, -OB.\n\nWait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so if the diagonals are AC and BD, then the midpoint of AC is O, and the midpoint of BD is O.\n\nSo, the coordinates of the four points would be A, B, -A, -B.\n\nSo, the rhombus is formed by the points A, B, -A, -B. So, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA.\n\nSo, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA.\n\nSo, vectors AB would be B - A, BC would be -A - B, etc.\n\nBut in a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, so |AB| = |BC| = |CD| = |DA|.\n\nSo, |B - A| = | -A - B|.\n\nSo, let's compute |B - A| and | -A - B|.\n\n|B - A|\u00b2 = (p - a cosh t)^2 + (q - b sinh t)^2.\n\n| -A - B|\u00b2 = (-a cosh t - p)^2 + (-b sinh t - q)^2.\n\nThese should be equal.\n\nExpanding both:\n\n|B - A|\u00b2 = (p - a cosh t)^2 + (q - b sinh t)^2 = p\u00b2 - 2a p cosh t + a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + q\u00b2 - 2b q sinh t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t.\n\n| -A - B|\u00b2 = (-a cosh t - p)^2 + (-b sinh t - q)^2 = a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + 2a p cosh t + p\u00b2 + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t + 2b q sinh t + q\u00b2.\n\nSetting them equal:\n\np\u00b2 - 2a p cosh t + a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + q\u00b2 - 2b q sinh t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t = a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + 2a p cosh t + p\u00b2 + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t + 2b q sinh t + q\u00b2.\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft side: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2a p cosh t - 2b q sinh t + (a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t).\n\nRight side: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2a p cosh t + 2b q sinh t + (a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t).\n\nSubtract left side from right side:\n\n0 = 4a p cosh t + 4b q sinh t.\n\nSo, 4a p cosh t + 4b q sinh t = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\na p cosh t + b q sinh t = 0.\n\nSo, equation (1): a p cosh t + b q sinh t = 0.\n\nAdditionally, since diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nSlope of AC: (from A to C is from (a cosh t, b sinh t) to (-a cosh t, -b sinh t), so slope is (-2b sinh t)/(-2a cosh t) = (b/a) tanh t.\n\nSlope of BD: (from B to D is from (p, q) to (-p, -q), so slope is (-2q)/(-2p) = q/p.\n\nSo, the product of the slopes is (b/a) tanh t * (q/p) = -1.\n\nSo, equation (2): (b q)/(a p) tanh t = -1.\n\nSo, now I have two equations:\n\n1. a p cosh t + b q sinh t = 0.\n\n2. (b q)/(a p) tanh t = -1.\n\nLet me write equation (2) as:\n\n(b q)/(a p) * (sinh t / cosh t) = -1.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(b q sinh t)/(a p cosh t) = -1.\n\nFrom equation (1), a p cosh t = - b q sinh t.\n\nSo, substitute a p cosh t from equation (1) into equation (2):\n\n(b q sinh t) / (-b q sinh t) = -1.\n\nWait, that simplifies to (-1) = -1.\n\nHmm, so equation (2) is automatically satisfied if equation (1) holds. That suggests that these two equations are not independent, and perhaps we need another condition.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should consider the other condition for the rhombus: that all sides are equal. So, perhaps |AB| = |AD|.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so |AB| = |BC| = |CD| = |DA|.\n\nWait, but in our setup, the four points are A, B, -A, -B. So, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA.\n\nWait, AB is from A to B, BC is from B to -A, CD is from -A to -B, and DA is from -B to A.\n\nWait, actually, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think of the rhombus as A connected to B, B connected to -A, -A connected to -B, and -B connected back to A. So, in that case, the sides are AB, B(-A), (-A)(-B), (-B)A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of vectors.\n\nWait, another approach: In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, the vectors OA and OB are such that OA and OB are adjacent vertices, but wait no, because OA and OB are not adjacent vertices. Wait, no, in our case, the four vertices are A, B, -A, -B, so the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA, as I thought before.\n\nWait, but perhaps another way is to note that in a rhombus, the adjacent sides are vectors that have the same length and are perpendicular in their difference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vectors OA and OB should satisfy that OA - OB has the same length as OA + OB or something like that. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe using the fact that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and their lengths satisfy the relation: (diagonal1)^2 + (diagonal2)^2 = 4*(side)^2.\n\nWait, yes, in a rhombus, the sum of the squares of the diagonals equals four times the square of a side. So, if d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals, then d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2 = 4a\u00b2, where a is the side length.\n\nSo, in our case, diagonals are AC and BD.\n\nLength of AC: distance between A and C.\n\nSince A is (a cosh t, b sinh t) and C is (-a cosh t, -b sinh t), the distance AC is sqrt[ (2a cosh t)^2 + (2b sinh t)^2 ] = 2 sqrt[ a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t ].\n\nSimilarly, BD is the distance between B and D, which is sqrt[ (2p)^2 + (2q)^2 ] = 2 sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, the lengths of the diagonals are AC = 2 sqrt(a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t) and BD = 2 sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, according to the rhombus property, (AC)^2 + (BD)^2 = 4*(side length)^2.\n\nBut the side length is |AB|, which is sqrt[ (p - a cosh t)^2 + (q - b sinh t)^2 ].\n\nSo, let's compute:\n\n(AC)^2 + (BD)^2 = [4(a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t)] + [4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)].\n\nAnd this should equal 4*(side length)^2.\n\nSo,\n\n4(a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t) + 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 4[ (p - a cosh t)^2 + (q - b sinh t)^2 ].\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\na\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t + p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = (p - a cosh t)^2 + (q - b sinh t)^2.\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n= p\u00b2 - 2a p cosh t + a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + q\u00b2 - 2b q sinh t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t.\n\nSo, left side: a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t + p\u00b2 + q\u00b2.\n\nRight side: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t - 2a p cosh t - 2b q sinh t.\n\nSubtracting left side from right side:\n\n0 = -2a p cosh t - 2b q sinh t.\n\nWhich gives:\n\n2a p cosh t + 2b q sinh t = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\na p cosh t + b q sinh t = 0.\n\nWhich is the same as equation (1) we had earlier.\n\nSo, this doesn't give us a new equation, but confirms that equation (1) is necessary.\n\nSo, perhaps I need another equation from the fact that points B and D lie on the hyperbola. So, p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, let me summarize the equations I have:\n\n1. a p cosh t + b q sinh t = 0.\n\n2. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAdditionally, from equation (2), which was derived from the slopes being perpendicular, we found that equation (2) was automatically satisfied given equation (1), so it doesn't give a new condition.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express q in terms of p from equation (1) and substitute into the hyperbola equation.\n\nLet me do that.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\na p cosh t + b q sinh t = 0.\n\nSolve for q:\n\nq = -(a p cosh t)/(b sinh t).\n\nSo, q = -(a p)/(b) * coth t.\n\nNow, substitute q into the hyperbola equation:\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2/20 - [ (a\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(b\u00b2) * coth\u00b2 t ] /24 = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\np\u00b2/20 - (a\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(24 b\u00b2) coth\u00b2 t = 1.\n\nFactor out p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (a\u00b2 coth\u00b2 t)/(24 b\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 [ (24 b\u00b2 - 20 a\u00b2 coth\u00b2 t ) / (20 * 24 b\u00b2) ) ] = 1.\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute the coefficients numerically.\n\nGiven a\u00b2 = 20, b\u00b2 = 24.\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (20 coth\u00b2 t )/(24 * 24) ].\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, a\u00b2 is 20, so a\u00b2 = 20, and b\u00b2 = 24.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (20 coth\u00b2 t )/(24 * 24) ].\n\nWait, wait, let me compute the terms correctly.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (a\u00b2 coth\u00b2 t)/(24 b\u00b2) ].\n\nSubstituting a\u00b2 = 20, b\u00b2 =24:\n\n= p\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (20 coth\u00b2 t)/(24 *24) ].\n\nCompute the second term:\n\n20/(24*24) = 20/(576) = 5/144.\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (5 coth\u00b2 t)/144 ] = 1.\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 = 1 / [ 1/20 - (5 coth\u00b2 t)/144 ].\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n1/20 - (5 coth\u00b2 t)/144 = (144 - 100 coth\u00b2 t) / (20 * 144).\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nFind a common denominator for 1/20 and 5/144.\n\nThe common denominator is 20 * 144 = 2880.\n\nSo,\n\n1/20 = 144/2880,\n\n5/144 = (5 * 20)/2880 = 100/2880.\n\nSo,\n\n1/20 - (5 coth\u00b2 t)/144 = (144 - 100 coth\u00b2 t)/2880.\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 = 1 / [ (144 - 100 coth\u00b2 t)/2880 ] = 2880 / (144 - 100 coth\u00b2 t).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\n2880 = 100 * 28.8, but perhaps factor 4:\n\n2880 = 4 * 720,\n\n144 - 100 coth\u00b2 t = 4*(36 - 25 coth\u00b2 t).\n\nWait,\n\n144 = 4*36,\n\n100 coth\u00b2 t = 4*25 coth\u00b2 t.\n\nSo,\n\n144 - 100 coth\u00b2 t = 4*(36 -25 coth\u00b2 t).\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 = 2880 / [4*(36 -25 coth\u00b2 t)] = 720 / (36 -25 coth\u00b2 t).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n720 = 20*36,\n\n36 -25 coth\u00b2 t = 36 -25 coth\u00b2 t.\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 = (20*36) / (36 -25 coth\u00b2 t) = (20 *36) / [36(1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t)].\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n36(1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t) = 36[1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t].\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 = (20 *36) / [36(1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t)] = 20 / [1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t].\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 20 / [1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t].\n\nSimilarly, we can find q from earlier:\n\nq = -(a p cosh t)/(b sinh t) = -(20 p cosh t)/(24 sinh t) = -(5 p cosh t)/(6 sinh t) = -(5 p)/(6) coth t.\n\nSo, q = -(5 p coth t)/6.\n\nSo, now, our aim is to find BD\u00b2.\n\nBD is the distance between B and D, which is sqrt[(2p)^2 + (2q)^2] = 2 sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nBut since q = -(5 p coth t)/6,\n\nq\u00b2 = (25 p\u00b2 coth\u00b2 t)/36.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + (25 p\u00b2 coth\u00b2 t)/36 ) = 4p\u00b2 [1 + (25 coth\u00b2 t)/36 ].\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4p\u00b2 [ (36 +25 coth\u00b2 t)/36 ] = (4p\u00b2 (36 +25 coth\u00b2 t))/36.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (p\u00b2 (36 +25 coth\u00b2 t))/9.\n\nBut we have p\u00b2 expressed in terms of coth\u00b2 t:\n\np\u00b2 = 20 / [1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t ].\n\nSo, substitute p\u00b2 into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 = [ (20 / [1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t ]) * (36 +25 coth\u00b2 t) ] /9.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n20*(36 +25 coth\u00b2 t) / [1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t ].\n\nDenominator is 9.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = [20*(36 +25 coth\u00b2 t) / (1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t) ] /9.\n\nLet me compute the numerator and denominator step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 20*(36 +25 coth\u00b2 t):\n\n= 20*36 + 20*25 coth\u00b2 t = 720 + 500 coth\u00b2 t.\n\nDenominator: 1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = (720 + 500 coth\u00b2 t) / [9*(1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t)].\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n9*(1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t) = 9 - (225/36) coth\u00b2 t = 9 - (25/4) coth\u00b2 t.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = (720 + 500 coth\u00b2 t) / (9 - (25/4) coth\u00b2 t).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = [720 + 500 coth\u00b2 t] / [9 - (25/4) coth\u00b2 t].\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n720 + 500 coth\u00b2 t = 100*(7.2 +5 coth\u00b2 t). Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, factor 100:\n\n= 100*(7.2 +5 coth\u00b2 t). Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps factor 4:\n\n720 = 4*180,\n\n500 = 4*125,\n\n25/4 is 6.25.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = [4*(180 + 125 coth\u00b2 t)] / [9 - (25/4) coth\u00b2 t].\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote u = coth\u00b2 t.\n\nThen,\n\nBD\u00b2 = (720 +500 u) / (9 - (25/4) u).\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n= (720 +500 u) / (9 - 6.25 u).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is a function of u, where u = coth\u00b2 t.\n\nNow, note that coth\u00b2 t \u2265 1, because coth t = (e^t + e^{-t})/(e^t - e^{-t}), which for t >0 is greater than 1, and for t <0 is less than -1, but squared, u is \u22651.\n\nSo, u \u22651.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is a function of u where u \u22651.\n\nSo, we have BD\u00b2(u) = (720 +500 u)/(9 - (25/4)u).\n\nWe need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible u \u22651.\n\nWait, but BD\u00b2 is a function that may have a minimum or maximum. We need to find the minimal BD\u00b2, but the question is about the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, and then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum.\n\nSo, to find the infimum, we can analyze BD\u00b2(u) as u approaches the values where the expression is defined.\n\nBut first, let's find the domain of u.\n\nThe denominator is 9 - (25/4) u. For the denominator not to be zero:\n\n9 - (25/4) u \u2260 0.\n\nSo,\n\n(25/4) u \u22609 \u2192 u \u2260 (9*4)/25 = 36/25 = 1.44.\n\nSo, as long as u \u22601.44, the expression is defined.\n\nBut since u = coth\u00b2 t \u22651, the domain is u \u22651, u \u22601.44.\n\nSo, now, let's see how BD\u00b2(u) behaves as u approaches 1.44 from below and above.\n\nBut let's first see if BD\u00b2(u) has a minimum somewhere.\n\nLet me compute BD\u00b2(u) as a function:\n\nBD\u00b2(u) = (720 +500u)/(9 - (25/4)u).\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nBD\u00b2(u) = [500u +720] / [ - (25/4)u +9 ].\n\nLet me denote the numerator as N(u) =500u +720,\n\ndenominator D(u)= - (25/4)u +9.\n\nWe can compute the derivative of BD\u00b2(u) with respect to u to find minima or maxima.\n\nSo, let me compute d(BD\u00b2)/du:\n\nUsing the quotient rule,\n\nd(BD\u00b2)/du = [N\u2019(u) D(u) - N(u) D\u2019(u)] / [D(u)]\u00b2.\n\nCompute N\u2019(u) =500,\n\nD\u2019(u) = -25/4.\n\nSo,\n\nd(BD\u00b2)/du = [500*( - (25/4) u +9 ) - (500u +720)*(-25/4) ] / [ (-25/4 u +9 )\u00b2 ].\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nFirst term: 500*(-25/4 u +9) = 500*(-25/4 u) +500*9 = -31250/4 u +4500.\n\nSecond term: -(500u +720)*(-25/4) = (500u +720)*(25/4) = (500u)(25/4) +720*(25/4) = (12500/4)u + 18000/4 = 3125 u +4500.\n\nSo, numerator:\n\n(-31250/4 u +4500) + (3125 u +4500).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nConvert 3125 u to fourths: 3125 u = 12500/4 u.\n\nSo,\n\n-31250/4 u +12500/4 u = (-31250 +12500)/4 u = (-18750)/4 u = -4687.5 u.\n\nConstants:4500 +4500=9000.\n\nSo, numerator is (-4687.5 u +9000).\n\nSo,\n\nd(BD\u00b2)/du = ( -4687.5 u +9000 ) / [ (-25/4 u +9 )\u00b2 ].\n\nSet derivative equal to zero to find critical points:\n\n-4687.5 u +9000 =0 \u2192 4687.5 u =9000 \u2192 u=9000/4687.5.\n\nCompute 9000 \u00f74687.5:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 75: 9000/75=120, 4687.5/75=62.5.\n\nSo, 120 /62.5= 1.92.\n\nSo, u=1.92.\n\nSo, the function BD\u00b2(u) has a critical point at u=1.92.\n\nNow, check if this is a minima or maxima.\n\nLooking at the derivative:\n\nFor u <1.92, let's pick u=1:\n\nNumerator: -4687.5*1 +9000= 4312.5>0, so derivative positive.\n\nFor u>1.92, say u=2:\n\nNumerator: -4687.5*2 +9000= -9375 +9000= -375 <0, so derivative negative.\n\nThus, the function BD\u00b2(u) increases until u=1.92, then decreases after that.\n\nSo, u=1.92 is a maximum point.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 occurs at the endpoints of the domain.\n\nThe domain is u \u22651, u \u22601.44.\n\nSo, the function BD\u00b2(u) tends to infinity as u approaches 1.44 from below and above.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nAs u approaches 1.44 from below (u \u21921.44^-):\n\nDenominator D(u) =9 - (25/4)u approaches 9 - (25/4)(1.44)=9 - (25/4)*(36/25)=9 -9=0.\n\nBut since u approaches 1.44 from below, D(u) approaches 0 from positive side.\n\nNumerator N(u) approaches 720 +500*(1.44)=720 +720=1440.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 1440/0^+ = +infty.\n\nSimilarly, as u approaches 1.44 from above, D(u) approaches 0 from negative side, so BD\u00b2 approaches -infty, but since BD\u00b2 is a squared length, it can't be negative. So, perhaps in reality, the function is only defined for u such that D(u) >0, i.e., 9 - (25/4)u >0 \u2192 u < (9*4)/25= 36/25=1.44.\n\nSo, the domain is u \u2208 [1, 1.44).\n\nSimilarly, when u approaches 1.44 from below, BD\u00b2 approaches +infty.\n\nAs u approaches 1, what is BD\u00b2(u)?\n\nCompute BD\u00b2(1):\n\n(720 +500*1)/(9 - (25/4)*1) = (1220)/(9 -6.25)=1220/2.75.\n\nCompute 1220 \u00f72.75:\n\n2.75 =11/4, so 1220/(11/4)=1220*(4/11)= (1220*4)/11=4880/11\u2248443.636.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(1)= approximately 443.636.\n\nBut as u increases towards 1.44, BD\u00b2 increases to infinity.\n\nWait, but we found a critical point at u=1.92, but 1.92 >1.44, which is outside our domain.\n\nSo, in our domain u \u2208 [1,1.44), BD\u00b2(u) is increasing from u=1 to u approaching 1.44, where it goes to infinity.\n\nSo, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 occurs at u=1, which is approximately 443.636.\n\nBut wait, let me compute BD\u00b2(u) at u=1 exactly.\n\nu=1:\n\nBD\u00b2= (720 +500*1)/(9 -25/4 *1)= (1220)/(9 -6.25)=1220/2.75.\n\nCompute 1220 \u00f72.75:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 4 to eliminate decimal:\n\n1220*4=4880,\n\n2.75*4=11.\n\nSo, 4880/11=443.636...\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=443.636... when u=1.\n\nNow, since BD\u00b2(u) is increasing on [1,1.44), the minimal value is 443.636..., and it can get arbitrarily large as u approaches 1.44.\n\nBut wait, the question is to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nSo, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 443.636..., which is 4880/11.\n\nBut wait, 4880/11 is exactly 443.636..., but let me confirm:\n\n11*443=4873,\n\n4880-4873=7,\n\nSo, 443 +7/11=443.636...\n\nSo, 4880/11=443 7/11.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 4880/11, approximately 443.636.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 can get as close to 4880/11 as desired when u approaches 1, but for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 4880/11.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when u=1, BD\u00b2=4880/11.\n\nBut as u increases towards 1.44, BD\u00b2 increases.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 4880/11, which occurs when u=1.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2 is always \u22654880/11.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 4880/11, because BD\u00b2 can be as low as 4880/11, and higher otherwise.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, if BD\u00b2 can be as low as 4880/11, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 4880/11 itself, but wait, 4880/11 is actually attainable when u=1.\n\nSo, the infimum is 4880/11, and the BD\u00b2 can be equal to that.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 4880/11, but wait, no, because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 4880/11. So, the number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would have to be less than or equal to 4880/11.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased as \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi,\" which would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 4880/11.\n\nBut since 4880/11 is attainable, the infimum is 4880/11, and thus the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 4880/11.\n\nWait, no. If 4880/11 is the minimal value, then any number less than 4880/11 would not be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because for some rhombus, BD\u00b2 is exactly 4880/11, so any number less than that would be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but the greatest such number is 4880/11 itself.\n\nWait, but 4880/11 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so the number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be any number less than 4880/11.\n\nBut the question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, the supremum of such numbers is 4880/11.\n\nBecause for any number less than 4880/11, say 4880/11 - \u03b5, it's less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but the greatest such number is 4880/11, because if you take the number as 4880/11, it's equal to BD\u00b2 for the rhombus where u=1, so it's not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point.\n\nSo, since BD\u00b2 can be equal to 4880/11, then 4880/11 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=4880/11, 4880/11 is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Since BD\u00b2 can be as low as 4880/11, the supremum of numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 4880/11.\n\nBut wait, that seems contradictory because 4880/11 is attainable, so there's no number greater than 4880/11 that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nThe problem asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is at least 4880/11, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 4880/11, because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 4880/11, but can't be less. So, any number less than 4880/11 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but the greatest such number is 4880/11.\n\nWait, no. If BD\u00b2 can be equal to 4880/11, then 4880/11 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because for that particular rhombus, BD\u00b2 equals 4880/11.\n\nSo, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the supremum of numbers less than all BD\u00b2. Since BD\u00b2 can be as low as 4880/11, the supremum would be 4880/11.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, think of it this way. Let S be the set of all BD\u00b2 for the rhombi. Then, we need the supremum of the set T = {x | x < BD\u00b2 for all BD\u00b2 \u2208 S}.\n\nSo, T is the set of all x such that x is less than every BD\u00b2 in S.\n\nThe supremum of T would be the infimum of S.\n\nBecause T is all x less than every element of S, so the largest such x is the infimum of S.\n\nSo, if the infimum of S is 4880/11, then the supremum of T is 4880/11.\n\nBut 4880/11 is not in T, because for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=4880/11, x=4880/11 is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nThus, the supremum of T is 4880/11, but it's not attained.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 4880/11.\n\nSo, the answer is 4880/11.\n\nWait, but 4880 divided by 11 is 443.636..., which is a repeating decimal.\n\nBut 4880 \u00f711:\n\n11*443=4873,\n\n4880-4873=7,\n\nSo, 443 and 7/11, which is 443.636363...\n\nSo, 4880/11 is the exact value.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 4880/11.\n\nBut let me confirm once again.\n\nWe found that BD\u00b2(u) is minimized at u=1, giving BD\u00b2=4880/11. For u>1, BD\u00b2 increases, approaching infinity as u approaches 1.44.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 4880/11, so any number less than 4880/11 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but the greatest such number is 4880/11 itself.\n\nWait, but since 4880/11 is attainable, it's not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi because for that particular rhombus, BD\u00b2=4880/11, so 4880/11 is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 4880/11, but since it's attainable, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be just below 4880/11. But since we're to give the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, which is the infimum, which is 4880/11.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about it differently.\n\nIf we have to find the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for every possible rhombus, that number must be less than or equal to the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nBecause if the minimal BD\u00b2 is m, then any number less than m would satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but the greatest such number is m itself.\n\nWait, but if m is attainable, then m is not less than BD\u00b2 for that particular rhombus. So, in that case, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is m.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose BD\u00b2 can be as low as 5, then the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is 5, because for any x <5, there exists a BD\u00b2=5 which is greater than x, but for x=5, BD\u00b2=5 is not greater than x. So, the supremum is 5, but it's not attainable as a lower bound.\n\nWait, but in our case, BD\u00b2 can be equal to 4880/11, so the set of numbers x where x < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the interval (-infty, 4880/11). The supremum of this interval is 4880/11.\n\nSo, the answer is 4880/11.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 4880/11.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. The hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. The rhombus is named ABCD, and its diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals do bisect the angles and are perpendicular. Yes, I think that's right. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's an important point.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the rhombus is symmetric with respect to the origin. So, points A, B, C, D must be arranged such that they are symmetric with respect to the origin.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points must be in such a way that if one point is (x, y), the opposite point is (-x, -y). So, for example, if A is (x, y), then C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D would be (-p, -q). So, the four points of the rhombus are (x, y), (p, q), (-x, -y), (-p, -q).\n\nBut wait, since it's a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B must be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to parametrize the points on the hyperbola and then use the properties of the rhombus to find relationships between them.\n\nSo, the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, any point on this hyperbola can be represented parametrically. For hyperbolas, the standard parametrization is (a sec \u03b8, b tan \u03b8), where a\u00b2 = 20 and b\u00b2 = 24. So, a = sqrt(20), which is 2*sqrt(5), and b = sqrt(24), which is 2*sqrt(6).\n\nSo, points on the hyperbola can be written as (2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan \u03b8). Alternatively, sometimes hyperbola parametrization is done using hyperbolic functions: (a cosh t, b sinh t). But maybe the trigonometric parametrization is easier here.\n\nWait, but hyperbola parametrization using trigonometric functions isn't as straightforward because hyperbola isn't periodic like circles. So, maybe the hyperbolic functions are better for parametrization.\n\nWait, I think the standard parametrization for hyperbola is indeed (a cosh t, b sinh t), since cosh\u00b2 t - sinh\u00b2 t = 1, so when you divide by a\u00b2 and b\u00b2, it gives the hyperbola equation.\n\nSo, perhaps using hyperbolic functions might be better here. So, let's denote the points as:\n\nA: (a cosh t, b sinh t)\n\nC: (-a cosh t, -b sinh t)\n\nSimilarly, points B and D would be another pair symmetric about the origin.\n\nBut since it's a rhombus, the sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, etc.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, AC is from (a cosh t, b sinh t) to (-a cosh t, -b sinh t), so the length of AC is 2a cosh t and 2b sinh t in each direction, but wait, actually, the distance between A and C is sqrt[(2a cosh t)^2 + (2b sinh t)^2], which would be the length of diagonal AC.\n\nSimilarly, BD would be the other diagonal, but since B and D are symmetric about the origin, their coordinates are (p, q) and (-p, -q). So, the length of BD is sqrt[(2p)^2 + (2q)^2] = 2 sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nBut both points B and D must lie on the hyperbola. So, p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, the diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD. Now, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular to each other. So, the product of their slopes should be -1.\n\nWait, let's think about that. The diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.\n\nSo, the slope of AC is (from A to C): ( -b sinh t - b sinh t ) / ( -a cosh t - a cosh t ) = (-2b sinh t)/(-2a cosh t) = (b/a) tanh t.\n\nSimilarly, the slope of BD would be (from B to D): (-q - q)/(-p - p) = (-2q)/(-2p) = q/p.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nSo, (b/a) tanh t * (q/p) = -1.\n\nSo, (b q)/(a p) tanh t = -1.\n\nBut I also know that points B and D are on the hyperbola, so p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAdditionally, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, etc.\n\nWait, but maybe another approach is better. Let me consider vectors.\n\nLet me denote vectors OA = (a cosh t, b sinh t), and OB = (p, q). Since ABCD is a rhombus, the vectors OA and OB must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nIn a rhombus, the adjacent sides are vectors that have the same magnitude and their sum and difference give the diagonals.\n\nWait, so in a rhombus, if O is the intersection point of the diagonals, then the vectors from O to the vertices are such that OA and OB are two adjacent vertices, but wait, no, in this case, O is the origin, and the diagonals intersect at O, so the vertices are OA, OB, -OA, -OB.\n\nWait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so if the diagonals are AC and BD, then the midpoint of AC is O, and the midpoint of BD is O.\n\nSo, the coordinates of the four points would be A, B, -A, -B.\n\nSo, the rhombus is formed by the points A, B, -A, -B. So, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA.\n\nSo, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA.\n\nSo, vectors AB would be B - A, BC would be -A - B, etc.\n\nBut in a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, so |AB| = |BC| = |CD| = |DA|.\n\nSo, |B - A| = | -A - B|.\n\nSo, let's compute |B - A| and | -A - B|.\n\n|B - A|\u00b2 = (p - a cosh t)^2 + (q - b sinh t)^2.\n\n| -A - B|\u00b2 = (-a cosh t - p)^2 + (-b sinh t - q)^2.\n\nThese should be equal.\n\nExpanding both:\n\n|B - A|\u00b2 = (p - a cosh t)^2 + (q - b sinh t)^2 = p\u00b2 - 2a p cosh t + a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + q\u00b2 - 2b q sinh t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t.\n\n| -A - B|\u00b2 = (-a cosh t - p)^2 + (-b sinh t - q)^2 = a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + 2a p cosh t + p\u00b2 + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t + 2b q sinh t + q\u00b2.\n\nSetting them equal:\n\np\u00b2 - 2a p cosh t + a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + q\u00b2 - 2b q sinh t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t = a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + 2a p cosh t + p\u00b2 + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t + 2b q sinh t + q\u00b2.\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft side: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2a p cosh t - 2b q sinh t + (a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t).\n\nRight side: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2a p cosh t + 2b q sinh t + (a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t).\n\nSubtract left side from right side:\n\n0 = 4a p cosh t + 4b q sinh t.\n\nSo, 4a p cosh t + 4b q sinh t = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\na p cosh t + b q sinh t = 0.\n\nSo, equation (1): a p cosh t + b q sinh t = 0.\n\nAdditionally, since diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nSlope of AC: (from A to C is from (a cosh t, b sinh t) to (-a cosh t, -b sinh t), so slope is (-2b sinh t)/(-2a cosh t) = (b/a) tanh t.\n\nSlope of BD: (from B to D is from (p, q) to (-p, -q), so slope is (-2q)/(-2p) = q/p.\n\nSo, the product of the slopes is (b/a) tanh t * (q/p) = -1.\n\nSo, equation (2): (b q)/(a p) tanh t = -1.\n\nSo, now I have two equations:\n\n1. a p cosh t + b q sinh t = 0.\n\n2. (b q)/(a p) tanh t = -1.\n\nLet me write equation (2) as:\n\n(b q)/(a p) * (sinh t / cosh t) = -1.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(b q sinh t)/(a p cosh t) = -1.\n\nFrom equation (1), a p cosh t = - b q sinh t.\n\nSo, substitute a p cosh t from equation (1) into equation (2):\n\n(b q sinh t) / (-b q sinh t) = -1.\n\nWait, that simplifies to (-1) = -1.\n\nHmm, so equation (2) is automatically satisfied if equation (1) holds. That suggests that these two equations are not independent, and perhaps we need another condition.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should consider the other condition for the rhombus: that all sides are equal. So, perhaps |AB| = |AD|.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so |AB| = |BC| = |CD| = |DA|.\n\nWait, but in our setup, the four points are A, B, -A, -B. So, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA.\n\nWait, AB is from A to B, BC is from B to -A, CD is from -A to -B, and DA is from -B to A.\n\nWait, actually, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think of the rhombus as A connected to B, B connected to -A, -A connected to -B, and -B connected back to A. So, in that case, the sides are AB, B(-A), (-A)(-B), (-B)A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of vectors.\n\nWait, another approach: In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, the vectors OA and OB are such that OA and OB are adjacent vertices, but wait no, because OA and OB are not adjacent vertices. Wait, no, in our case, the four vertices are A, B, -A, -B, so the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA, as I thought before.\n\nWait, but perhaps another way is to note that in a rhombus, the adjacent sides are vectors that have the same length and are perpendicular in their difference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vectors OA and OB should satisfy that OA - OB has the same length as OA + OB or something like that. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe using the fact that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and their lengths satisfy the relation: (diagonal1)^2 + (diagonal2)^2 = 4*(side)^2.\n\nWait, yes, in a rhombus, the sum of the squares of the diagonals equals four times the square of a side. So, if d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals, then d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2 = 4a\u00b2, where a is the side length.\n\nSo, in our case, diagonals are AC and BD.\n\nLength of AC: distance between A and C.\n\nSince A is (a cosh t, b sinh t) and C is (-a cosh t, -b sinh t), the distance AC is sqrt[ (2a cosh t)^2 + (2b sinh t)^2 ] = 2 sqrt[ a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t ].\n\nSimilarly, BD is the distance between B and D, which is sqrt[ (2p)^2 + (2q)^2 ] = 2 sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, the lengths of the diagonals are AC = 2 sqrt(a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t) and BD = 2 sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, according to the rhombus property, (AC)^2 + (BD)^2 = 4*(side length)^2.\n\nBut the side length is |AB|, which is sqrt[ (p - a cosh t)^2 + (q - b sinh t)^2 ].\n\nSo, let's compute:\n\n(AC)^2 + (BD)^2 = [4(a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t)] + [4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)].\n\nAnd this should equal 4*(side length)^2.\n\nSo,\n\n4(a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t) + 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 4[ (p - a cosh t)^2 + (q - b sinh t)^2 ].\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\na\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t + p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = (p - a cosh t)^2 + (q - b sinh t)^2.\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n= p\u00b2 - 2a p cosh t + a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + q\u00b2 - 2b q sinh t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t.\n\nSo, left side: a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t + p\u00b2 + q\u00b2.\n\nRight side: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + a\u00b2 cosh\u00b2 t + b\u00b2 sinh\u00b2 t - 2a p cosh t - 2b q sinh t.\n\nSubtracting left side from right side:\n\n0 = -2a p cosh t - 2b q sinh t.\n\nWhich gives:\n\n2a p cosh t + 2b q sinh t = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\na p cosh t + b q sinh t = 0.\n\nWhich is the same as equation (1) we had earlier.\n\nSo, this doesn't give us a new equation, but confirms that equation (1) is necessary.\n\nSo, perhaps I need another equation from the fact that points B and D lie on the hyperbola. So, p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, let me summarize the equations I have:\n\n1. a p cosh t + b q sinh t = 0.\n\n2. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAdditionally, from equation (2), which was derived from the slopes being perpendicular, we found that equation (2) was automatically satisfied given equation (1), so it doesn't give a new condition.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express q in terms of p from equation (1) and substitute into the hyperbola equation.\n\nLet me do that.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\na p cosh t + b q sinh t = 0.\n\nSolve for q:\n\nq = -(a p cosh t)/(b sinh t).\n\nSo, q = -(a p)/(b) * coth t.\n\nNow, substitute q into the hyperbola equation:\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2/20 - [ (a\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(b\u00b2) * coth\u00b2 t ] /24 = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\np\u00b2/20 - (a\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(24 b\u00b2) coth\u00b2 t = 1.\n\nFactor out p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (a\u00b2 coth\u00b2 t)/(24 b\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 [ (24 b\u00b2 - 20 a\u00b2 coth\u00b2 t ) / (20 * 24 b\u00b2) ) ] = 1.\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute the coefficients numerically.\n\nGiven a\u00b2 = 20, b\u00b2 = 24.\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (20 coth\u00b2 t )/(24 * 24) ].\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, a\u00b2 is 20, so a\u00b2 = 20, and b\u00b2 = 24.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (20 coth\u00b2 t )/(24 * 24) ].\n\nWait, wait, let me compute the terms correctly.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (a\u00b2 coth\u00b2 t)/(24 b\u00b2) ].\n\nSubstituting a\u00b2 = 20, b\u00b2 =24:\n\n= p\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (20 coth\u00b2 t)/(24 *24) ].\n\nCompute the second term:\n\n20/(24*24) = 20/(576) = 5/144.\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (5 coth\u00b2 t)/144 ] = 1.\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 = 1 / [ 1/20 - (5 coth\u00b2 t)/144 ].\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n1/20 - (5 coth\u00b2 t)/144 = (144 - 100 coth\u00b2 t) / (20 * 144).\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nFind a common denominator for 1/20 and 5/144.\n\nThe common denominator is 20 * 144 = 2880.\n\nSo,\n\n1/20 = 144/2880,\n\n5/144 = (5 * 20)/2880 = 100/2880.\n\nSo,\n\n1/20 - (5 coth\u00b2 t)/144 = (144 - 100 coth\u00b2 t)/2880.\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 = 1 / [ (144 - 100 coth\u00b2 t)/2880 ] = 2880 / (144 - 100 coth\u00b2 t).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\n2880 = 100 * 28.8, but perhaps factor 4:\n\n2880 = 4 * 720,\n\n144 - 100 coth\u00b2 t = 4*(36 - 25 coth\u00b2 t).\n\nWait,\n\n144 = 4*36,\n\n100 coth\u00b2 t = 4*25 coth\u00b2 t.\n\nSo,\n\n144 - 100 coth\u00b2 t = 4*(36 -25 coth\u00b2 t).\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 = 2880 / [4*(36 -25 coth\u00b2 t)] = 720 / (36 -25 coth\u00b2 t).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n720 = 20*36,\n\n36 -25 coth\u00b2 t = 36 -25 coth\u00b2 t.\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 = (20*36) / (36 -25 coth\u00b2 t) = (20 *36) / [36(1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t)].\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n36(1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t) = 36[1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t].\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 = (20 *36) / [36(1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t)] = 20 / [1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t].\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 20 / [1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t].\n\nSimilarly, we can find q from earlier:\n\nq = -(a p cosh t)/(b sinh t) = -(20 p cosh t)/(24 sinh t) = -(5 p cosh t)/(6 sinh t) = -(5 p)/(6) coth t.\n\nSo, q = -(5 p coth t)/6.\n\nSo, now, our aim is to find BD\u00b2.\n\nBD is the distance between B and D, which is sqrt[(2p)^2 + (2q)^2] = 2 sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nBut since q = -(5 p coth t)/6,\n\nq\u00b2 = (25 p\u00b2 coth\u00b2 t)/36.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + (25 p\u00b2 coth\u00b2 t)/36 ) = 4p\u00b2 [1 + (25 coth\u00b2 t)/36 ].\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4p\u00b2 [ (36 +25 coth\u00b2 t)/36 ] = (4p\u00b2 (36 +25 coth\u00b2 t))/36.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (p\u00b2 (36 +25 coth\u00b2 t))/9.\n\nBut we have p\u00b2 expressed in terms of coth\u00b2 t:\n\np\u00b2 = 20 / [1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t ].\n\nSo, substitute p\u00b2 into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 = [ (20 / [1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t ]) * (36 +25 coth\u00b2 t) ] /9.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n20*(36 +25 coth\u00b2 t) / [1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t ].\n\nDenominator is 9.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = [20*(36 +25 coth\u00b2 t) / (1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t) ] /9.\n\nLet me compute the numerator and denominator step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 20*(36 +25 coth\u00b2 t):\n\n= 20*36 + 20*25 coth\u00b2 t = 720 + 500 coth\u00b2 t.\n\nDenominator: 1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = (720 + 500 coth\u00b2 t) / [9*(1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t)].\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n9*(1 - (25/36) coth\u00b2 t) = 9 - (225/36) coth\u00b2 t = 9 - (25/4) coth\u00b2 t.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = (720 + 500 coth\u00b2 t) / (9 - (25/4) coth\u00b2 t).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = [720 + 500 coth\u00b2 t] / [9 - (25/4) coth\u00b2 t].\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n720 + 500 coth\u00b2 t = 100*(7.2 +5 coth\u00b2 t). Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, factor 100:\n\n= 100*(7.2 +5 coth\u00b2 t). Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps factor 4:\n\n720 = 4*180,\n\n500 = 4*125,\n\n25/4 is 6.25.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = [4*(180 + 125 coth\u00b2 t)] / [9 - (25/4) coth\u00b2 t].\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote u = coth\u00b2 t.\n\nThen,\n\nBD\u00b2 = (720 +500 u) / (9 - (25/4) u).\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n= (720 +500 u) / (9 - 6.25 u).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is a function of u, where u = coth\u00b2 t.\n\nNow, note that coth\u00b2 t \u2265 1, because coth t = (e^t + e^{-t})/(e^t - e^{-t}), which for t >0 is greater than 1, and for t <0 is less than -1, but squared, u is \u22651.\n\nSo, u \u22651.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is a function of u where u \u22651.\n\nSo, we have BD\u00b2(u) = (720 +500 u)/(9 - (25/4)u).\n\nWe need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible u \u22651.\n\nWait, but BD\u00b2 is a function that may have a minimum or maximum. We need to find the minimal BD\u00b2, but the question is about the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, and then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum.\n\nSo, to find the infimum, we can analyze BD\u00b2(u) as u approaches the values where the expression is defined.\n\nBut first, let's find the domain of u.\n\nThe denominator is 9 - (25/4) u. For the denominator not to be zero:\n\n9 - (25/4) u \u2260 0.\n\nSo,\n\n(25/4) u \u22609 \u2192 u \u2260 (9*4)/25 = 36/25 = 1.44.\n\nSo, as long as u \u22601.44, the expression is defined.\n\nBut since u = coth\u00b2 t \u22651, the domain is u \u22651, u \u22601.44.\n\nSo, now, let's see how BD\u00b2(u) behaves as u approaches 1.44 from below and above.\n\nBut let's first see if BD\u00b2(u) has a minimum somewhere.\n\nLet me compute BD\u00b2(u) as a function:\n\nBD\u00b2(u) = (720 +500u)/(9 - (25/4)u).\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nBD\u00b2(u) = [500u +720] / [ - (25/4)u +9 ].\n\nLet me denote the numerator as N(u) =500u +720,\n\ndenominator D(u)= - (25/4)u +9.\n\nWe can compute the derivative of BD\u00b2(u) with respect to u to find minima or maxima.\n\nSo, let me compute d(BD\u00b2)/du:\n\nUsing the quotient rule,\n\nd(BD\u00b2)/du = [N\u2019(u) D(u) - N(u) D\u2019(u)] / [D(u)]\u00b2.\n\nCompute N\u2019(u) =500,\n\nD\u2019(u) = -25/4.\n\nSo,\n\nd(BD\u00b2)/du = [500*( - (25/4) u +9 ) - (500u +720)*(-25/4) ] / [ (-25/4 u +9 )\u00b2 ].\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nFirst term: 500*(-25/4 u +9) = 500*(-25/4 u) +500*9 = -31250/4 u +4500.\n\nSecond term: -(500u +720)*(-25/4) = (500u +720)*(25/4) = (500u)(25/4) +720*(25/4) = (12500/4)u + 18000/4 = 3125 u +4500.\n\nSo, numerator:\n\n(-31250/4 u +4500) + (3125 u +4500).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nConvert 3125 u to fourths: 3125 u = 12500/4 u.\n\nSo,\n\n-31250/4 u +12500/4 u = (-31250 +12500)/4 u = (-18750)/4 u = -4687.5 u.\n\nConstants:4500 +4500=9000.\n\nSo, numerator is (-4687.5 u +9000).\n\nSo,\n\nd(BD\u00b2)/du = ( -4687.5 u +9000 ) / [ (-25/4 u +9 )\u00b2 ].\n\nSet derivative equal to zero to find critical points:\n\n-4687.5 u +9000 =0 \u2192 4687.5 u =9000 \u2192 u=9000/4687.5.\n\nCompute 9000 \u00f74687.5:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 75: 9000/75=120, 4687.5/75=62.5.\n\nSo, 120 /62.5= 1.92.\n\nSo, u=1.92.\n\nSo, the function BD\u00b2(u) has a critical point at u=1.92.\n\nNow, check if this is a minima or maxima.\n\nLooking at the derivative:\n\nFor u <1.92, let's pick u=1:\n\nNumerator: -4687.5*1 +9000= 4312.5>0, so derivative positive.\n\nFor u>1.92, say u=2:\n\nNumerator: -4687.5*2 +9000= -9375 +9000= -375 <0, so derivative negative.\n\nThus, the function BD\u00b2(u) increases until u=1.92, then decreases after that.\n\nSo, u=1.92 is a maximum point.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 occurs at the endpoints of the domain.\n\nThe domain is u \u22651, u \u22601.44.\n\nSo, the function BD\u00b2(u) tends to infinity as u approaches 1.44 from below and above.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nAs u approaches 1.44 from below (u \u21921.44^-):\n\nDenominator D(u) =9 - (25/4)u approaches 9 - (25/4)(1.44)=9 - (25/4)*(36/25)=9 -9=0.\n\nBut since u approaches 1.44 from below, D(u) approaches 0 from positive side.\n\nNumerator N(u) approaches 720 +500*(1.44)=720 +720=1440.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 1440/0^+ = +infty.\n\nSimilarly, as u approaches 1.44 from above, D(u) approaches 0 from negative side, so BD\u00b2 approaches -infty, but since BD\u00b2 is a squared length, it can't be negative. So, perhaps in reality, the function is only defined for u such that D(u) >0, i.e., 9 - (25/4)u >0 \u2192 u < (9*4)/25= 36/25=1.44.\n\nSo, the domain is u \u2208 [1, 1.44).\n\nSimilarly, when u approaches 1.44 from below, BD\u00b2 approaches +infty.\n\nAs u approaches 1, what is BD\u00b2(u)?\n\nCompute BD\u00b2(1):\n\n(720 +500*1)/(9 - (25/4)*1) = (1220)/(9 -6.25)=1220/2.75.\n\nCompute 1220 \u00f72.75:\n\n2.75 =11/4, so 1220/(11/4)=1220*(4/11)= (1220*4)/11=4880/11\u2248443.636.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(1)= approximately 443.636.\n\nBut as u increases towards 1.44, BD\u00b2 increases to infinity.\n\nWait, but we found a critical point at u=1.92, but 1.92 >1.44, which is outside our domain.\n\nSo, in our domain u \u2208 [1,1.44), BD\u00b2(u) is increasing from u=1 to u approaching 1.44, where it goes to infinity.\n\nSo, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 occurs at u=1, which is approximately 443.636.\n\nBut wait, let me compute BD\u00b2(u) at u=1 exactly.\n\nu=1:\n\nBD\u00b2= (720 +500*1)/(9 -25/4 *1)= (1220)/(9 -6.25)=1220/2.75.\n\nCompute 1220 \u00f72.75:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 4 to eliminate decimal:\n\n1220*4=4880,\n\n2.75*4=11.\n\nSo, 4880/11=443.636...\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=443.636... when u=1.\n\nNow, since BD\u00b2(u) is increasing on [1,1.44), the minimal value is 443.636..., and it can get arbitrarily large as u approaches 1.44.\n\nBut wait, the question is to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nSo, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 443.636..., which is 4880/11.\n\nBut wait, 4880/11 is exactly 443.636..., but let me confirm:\n\n11*443=4873,\n\n4880-4873=7,\n\nSo, 443 +7/11=443.636...\n\nSo, 4880/11=443 7/11.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 4880/11, approximately 443.636.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 can get as close to 4880/11 as desired when u approaches 1, but for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 4880/11.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when u=1, BD\u00b2=4880/11.\n\nBut as u increases towards 1.44, BD\u00b2 increases.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 4880/11, which occurs when u=1.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2 is always \u22654880/11.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 4880/11, because BD\u00b2 can be as low as 4880/11, and higher otherwise.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, if BD\u00b2 can be as low as 4880/11, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 4880/11 itself, but wait, 4880/11 is actually attainable when u=1.\n\nSo, the infimum is 4880/11, and the BD\u00b2 can be equal to that.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 4880/11, but wait, no, because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 4880/11. So, the number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would have to be less than or equal to 4880/11.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased as \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi,\" which would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 4880/11.\n\nBut since 4880/11 is attainable, the infimum is 4880/11, and thus the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 4880/11.\n\nWait, no. If 4880/11 is the minimal value, then any number less than 4880/11 would not be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because for some rhombus, BD\u00b2 is exactly 4880/11, so any number less than that would be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but the greatest such number is 4880/11 itself.\n\nWait, but 4880/11 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so the number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be any number less than 4880/11.\n\nBut the question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, the supremum of such numbers is 4880/11.\n\nBecause for any number less than 4880/11, say 4880/11 - \u03b5, it's less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but the greatest such number is 4880/11, because if you take the number as 4880/11, it's equal to BD\u00b2 for the rhombus where u=1, so it's not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point.\n\nSo, since BD\u00b2 can be equal to 4880/11, then 4880/11 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=4880/11, 4880/11 is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Since BD\u00b2 can be as low as 4880/11, the supremum of numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 4880/11.\n\nBut wait, that seems contradictory because 4880/11 is attainable, so there's no number greater than 4880/11 that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nThe problem asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is at least 4880/11, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 4880/11, because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 4880/11, but can't be less. So, any number less than 4880/11 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but the greatest such number is 4880/11.\n\nWait, no. If BD\u00b2 can be equal to 4880/11, then 4880/11 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because for that particular rhombus, BD\u00b2 equals 4880/11.\n\nSo, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the supremum of numbers less than all BD\u00b2. Since BD\u00b2 can be as low as 4880/11, the supremum would be 4880/11.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, think of it this way. Let S be the set of all BD\u00b2 for the rhombi. Then, we need the supremum of the set T = {x | x < BD\u00b2 for all BD\u00b2 \u2208 S}.\n\nSo, T is the set of all x such that x is less than every BD\u00b2 in S.\n\nThe supremum of T would be the infimum of S.\n\nBecause T is all x less than every element of S, so the largest such x is the infimum of S.\n\nSo, if the infimum of S is 4880/11, then the supremum of T is 4880/11.\n\nBut 4880/11 is not in T, because for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=4880/11, x=4880/11 is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nThus, the supremum of T is 4880/11, but it's not attained.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 4880/11.\n\nSo, the answer is 4880/11.\n\nWait, but 4880 divided by 11 is 443.636..., which is a repeating decimal.\n\nBut 4880 \u00f711:\n\n11*443=4873,\n\n4880-4873=7,\n\nSo, 443 and 7/11, which is 443.636363...\n\nSo, 4880/11 is the exact value.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 4880/11.\n\nBut let me confirm once again.\n\nWe found that BD\u00b2(u) is minimized at u=1, giving BD\u00b2=4880/11. For u>1, BD\u00b2 increases, approaching infinity as u approaches 1.44.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 4880/11, so any number less than 4880/11 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but the greatest such number is 4880/11 itself.\n\nWait, but since 4880/11 is attainable, it's not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi because for that particular rhombus, BD\u00b2=4880/11, so 4880/11 is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 4880/11, but since it's attainable, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be just below 4880/11. But since we're to give the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, which is the infimum, which is 4880/11.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about it differently.\n\nIf we have to find the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for every possible rhombus, that number must be less than or equal to the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nBecause if the minimal BD\u00b2 is m, then any number less than m would satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but the greatest such number is m itself.\n\nWait, but if m is attainable, then m is not less than BD\u00b2 for that particular rhombus. So, in that case, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is m.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose BD\u00b2 can be as low as 5, then the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is 5, because for any x <5, there exists a BD\u00b2=5 which is greater than x, but for x=5, BD\u00b2=5 is not greater than x. So, the supremum is 5, but it's not attainable as a lower bound.\n\nWait, but in our case, BD\u00b2 can be equal to 4880/11, so the set of numbers x where x < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the interval (-infty, 4880/11). The supremum of this interval is 4880/11.\n\nSo, the answer is 4880/11.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 4880/11.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus \\(ABCD\\) on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) are perpendicular, and the rhombus is symmetric about the origin.\n\n1. **Parametrization of Points**: Points \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are parameterized as \\((a \\cosh t, b \\sinh t)\\) and \\((-a \\cosh t, -b \\sinh t)\\), respectively, where \\(a = \\sqrt{20}\\) and \\(b = \\sqrt{24}\\). Points \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) are symmetric as \\((p, q)\\) and \\((-p, -q)\\), lying on the hyperbola.\n\n2. **Slope Condition**: The slopes of diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) are \\(\\frac{b}{a} \\tanh t\\) and \\(\\frac{q}{p}\\), respectively. Since they are perpendicular, their product is \\(-1\\), leading to the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{b q}{a p} \\tanh t = -1.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hyperbola Constraint**: Points \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) satisfy \\(\\frac{p^2}{20} - \\frac{q^2}{24} = 1\\).\n\n4. **Distance Condition**: Using the properties of a rhombus, the distances between adjacent vertices are equal, leading to the equation:\n   \\[\n   a p \\cosh t + b q \\sinh t = 0.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solving for \\(q\\)**: From the above equation, express \\(q\\) in terms of \\(p\\):\n   \\[\n   q = -\\frac{a p \\cosh t}{b \\sinh t}.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Substituting into Hyperbola Equation**: Substitute \\(q\\) into the hyperbola equation to find \\(p^2\\) in terms of \\(\\coth^2 t\\):\n   \\[\n   p^2 = \\frac{20}{1 - \\frac{25}{36} \\coth^2 t}.\n   \\]\n\n7. **Expressing \\(BD^2\\)**: The length of diagonal \\(BD\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = 4(p^2 + q^2).\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(q\\) and simplifying, we find:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = \\frac{(720 + 500 \\coth^2 t)}{9 - \\frac{25}{4} \\coth^2 t}.\n   \\]\n\n8. **Analyzing \\(BD^2\\)**: Let \\(u = \\coth^2 t\\), where \\(u \\geq 1\\). The function becomes:\n   \\[\n   BD^2(u) = \\frac{720 + 500u}{9 - \\frac{25}{4}u}.\n   \\]\n   The critical point analysis shows that \\(BD^2(u)\\) is minimized at \\(u = 1\\), yielding:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = \\frac{4880}{11}.\n   \\]\n\n9. **Conclusion**: The greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is the infimum of \\(BD^2\\), which is \\(\\frac{4880}{11}\\).\n\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{4880}{11}}",
