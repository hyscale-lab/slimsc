      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand everything.\n\nIt says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I. The line IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nHmm, okay. So, triangle ABC has some specific properties: it has a circumradius (R) of 13 and an inradius (r) of 6. Also, the incenter I is such that IA is perpendicular to OI. Interesting. I think I need to find AB multiplied by AC.\n\nFirst, let me recall some concepts. The circumradius R is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius r is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumcenter O is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, while the incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors.\n\nGiven that IA is perpendicular to OI, that seems like an important condition. I might need to use coordinates or some vector approach, but maybe there's a more straightforward way using properties of triangle centers.\n\nLet me think about the properties involving the inradius, circumradius, and the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. I remember there's a formula that relates the distance between O and I (OI) with R and r: OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that correct?\n\nYes, I think that's correct. The formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Let me confirm that. So, if R is the circumradius and r is the inradius, then the square of the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is equal to R squared minus twice R times r. So, OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr.\n\nGiven that R is 13 and r is 6, let me compute OI\u00b2:\n\nOI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So, OI is sqrt(13). That's approximately 3.605, but I'll keep it as sqrt(13) for exactness.\n\nSo, OI = sqrt(13). Now, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees. Wait, is that triangle IOA? Let me see. IA is perpendicular to OI, so the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees.\n\nWait, actually, IA is a segment from I to A, and OI is the segment from O to I. So, the lines IA and OI are perpendicular. So, that means that the lines IA and OI intersect at I and form a right angle there.\n\nSo, at point I, the lines IA and OI meet at 90 degrees. So, triangle IOA has a right angle at I.\n\nTherefore, in triangle IOA, we have a right triangle with legs OI and IA, and hypotenuse OA.\n\nBut OA is the circumradius, which is 13. Because OA is the distance from the circumcenter to vertex A, which is always equal to R. So, OA = 13.\n\nSo, in triangle IOA, right-angled at I, we have:\n\nOI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2\n\nWe know OI is sqrt(13), so OI\u00b2 is 13. OA\u00b2 is 13\u00b2 = 169. Therefore, IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2 - OI\u00b2 = 169 - 13 = 156. So, IA = sqrt(156). Simplify that: sqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). So, IA is 2\u221a39.\n\nBut IA is the length from the inradius center I to vertex A. Wait, IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. I think there's a formula for the distance from the inradius to a vertex. Let me recall.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Specifically, IA = r / sin(A/2), where r is the inradius and A is the angle at vertex A. Is that correct? Let me confirm.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. The formula is IA = r / sin(A/2). So, IA = r / sin(A/2). Since IA is 2\u221a39 and r is 6, we can write:\n\n2\u221a39 = 6 / sin(A/2)\n\nSolving for sin(A/2):\n\nsin(A/2) = 6 / (2\u221a39) = 3 / \u221a39 = (3\u221a39) / 39 = \u221a39 / 13.\n\nWait, let me compute that again. 3 divided by sqrt(39) is equal to 3\u221a39 / 39, which simplifies to \u221a39 / 13. So, sin(A/2) = \u221a39 / 13.\n\nHmm, okay. So, sin(A/2) = \u221a39 / 13. Let me note that down.\n\nNow, I need to find AB \u00b7 AC. Let me denote AB as c and AC as b, following the standard notation where a is BC, b is AC, and c is AB. So, we're to find b*c.\n\nWait, actually, let me confirm the standard notation. In triangle ABC, a is the length opposite angle A, so a = BC, b = AC, c = AB. So, yeah, AB is c, AC is b.\n\nSo, we need to find b*c.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, there are relationships between the sides, the inradius, the circumradius, and the angles. Let me think about how to relate this.\n\nWe know that in any triangle, the area is equal to r*s, where r is the inradius and s is the semi-perimeter. Also, the area is equal to (a*b*c) / (4R). So, we can write:\n\nArea = r*s = (a*b*c)/(4R)\n\nSo, we can write:\n\nr*s = (a*b*c)/(4R)\n\nBut I don't know the semi-perimeter s yet. Also, I don't know the sides a, b, c. So, maybe I need more information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can relate the sides using the sine formula. Since we have the circumradius, we know that a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.\n\nWait, that's correct. The Law of Sines states that a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C = 2R.\n\nSo, a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.\n\nSo, if I can find sin A, sin B, sin C, I can find the sides.\n\nBut I already know sin(A/2) from earlier. Let me think about how to get sin A from sin(A/2).\n\nWe can use the double-angle formula. Remember that sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2). So, if I have sin(A/2) = \u221a39 / 13, then cos(A/2) can be found using the identity sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 = 1.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2(A/2)) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nTherefore, sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(\u221a39/13)*(\u221a130/13) = 2*(\u221a(39*130))/(13*13)\n\nLet me compute 39*130. 39*130 = (40 -1)*130 = 40*130 -130 = 5200 -130 = 5070.\n\nWait, 39*130: 39*100=3900, 39*30=1170, so 3900+1170=5070. So, sqrt(5070). Hmm, 5070 is equal to 5070 = 10 * 507 = 10 * 3 * 169 = 10 * 3 * 13\u00b2. So, sqrt(5070) = sqrt(10 * 3 * 13\u00b2) = 13 * sqrt(30).\n\nWait, let me compute sqrt(5070):\n\n5070 = 10 * 507\n\n507 is 3 * 169 = 3 *13\u00b2\n\nSo, 5070 = 10 * 3 * 13\u00b2\n\nThus, sqrt(5070) = 13 * sqrt(30)\n\nSo, sin A = 2*(13 * sqrt(30)) / (13 *13) )= (26 sqrt(30)) / (169) )= (2 sqrt(30)) /13\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 2*(\u221a39/13)*(\u221a130/13) = 2*(sqrt(39*130))/(13*13) = 2*sqrt(5070)/(169)\n\nBut 5070 = 13\u00b2 *30, so sqrt(5070) =13*sqrt(30). Therefore, it becomes 2*(13 sqrt(30))/(169) = (26 sqrt(30))/169 = (2 sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, sin A is 2\u221a30 /13.\n\nOkay, so now, from the Law of Sines, we can write that:\n\na = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2\u221a30/13) = 2*13*(2\u221a30)/13 = 2*2\u221a30 = 4\u221a30.\n\nWait, let me compute that step by step.\n\na = 2R sin A\n\nR is 13, so 2R is 26.\n\nsin A is 2\u221a30 /13.\n\nSo, a = 26 * (2\u221a30 /13) = (26/13)*2\u221a30 = 2*2\u221a30 =4\u221a30. So, a = 4\u221a30.\n\nSo, side a (BC) is 4\u221a30. Now, I need to find sides b and c, which are AC and AB respectively.\n\nSo, b = AC = 2R sin B\n\nc = AB = 2R sin C\n\nSo, if I can find sin B and sin C, I can find b and c.\n\nBut I know that in any triangle, angles A + B + C = \u03c0 radians (180 degrees). So, B + C = \u03c0 - A.\n\nI also know that in any triangle, the sum of the angles is \u03c0, so maybe we can find relationships between B and C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find another equation involving b and c.\n\nWait, I also know that in a triangle, the product of the sides can be related to the area.\n\nBut perhaps another approach: using the fact that the inradius r = 6, and the area is r*s, where s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nSo, Area = r*s =6*s.\n\nAlso, Area = (a*b*c)/(4R). So,\n\n6*s = (a*b*c)/(4*13) => 6s = (a*b*c)/52 => (a*b*c) = 6*52*s = 312 s.\n\nBut I don't know s yet. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use Heron's formula, which states that Area = sqrt[s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c)].\n\nBut without knowing s, a, b, c, this might not be directly helpful. But maybe I can find another relation.\n\nWait, I also know that in a triangle, tan(A/2) = r / (s - a). Let me recall that.\n\nYes, tan(A/2) = r / (s - a).\n\nWe have sin(A/2) = \u221a39 /13, so cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nTherefore, tan(A/2) = sin(A/2)/cos(A/2) = (\u221a39 /13) / (\u221a130 /13) )= \u221a39 / \u221a130 = sqrt(39/130).\n\nSimplify 39/130: 39 divides by 13, 130 is 13*10. So, 39/130 = 3/10. So, tan(A/2) = sqrt(3/10) = \u221a30 /10.\n\nWait, sqrt(3/10) is equal to sqrt(30)/10. Yes, because sqrt(3/10) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(10) = (sqrt(3)*sqrt(10))/10 = sqrt(30)/10.\n\nSo, tan(A/2) = sqrt(30)/10.\n\nBut tan(A/2) is also equal to r / (s - a), according to the formula.\n\nSo, sqrt(30)/10 = 6 / (s - a)\n\nSolve for (s - a):\n\ns - a = 6 / (sqrt(30)/10) )= 6 * (10 / sqrt(30)) = 60 / sqrt(30) = (60 sqrt(30)) /30 = 2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s - a = 2 sqrt(30).\n\nBut a =4 sqrt(30), so s = a + 2 sqrt(30) =4 sqrt(30) + 2 sqrt(30) =6 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, the semi-perimeter s is 6 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s =6 sqrt(30).\n\nOkay, so now, the semi-perimeter is known. So, s = (a + b + c)/2 =6 sqrt(30).\n\nThus, a + b + c =12 sqrt(30).\n\nWe already know that a =4 sqrt(30), so 4 sqrt(30) + b + c =12 sqrt(30). Therefore, b + c =8 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, now we have that b + c =8 sqrt(30). And we need to find b*c.\n\nSo, if I can find another equation involving b and c, I can solve for b*c.\n\nWe know that in a triangle, the area is equal to r*s, which is 6*6 sqrt(30) =36 sqrt(30).\n\nAlternatively, the area can also be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nWe have sin A =2 sqrt(30)/13, so:\n\nArea = (1/2)*b*c*(2 sqrt(30)/13) )= (b c sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSet this equal to 36 sqrt(30):\n\n(b c sqrt(30))/13 =36 sqrt(30)\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(30):\n\nb c /13 =36\n\nMultiply both sides by13:\n\nb c = 468.\n\nSo, the product of b and c is 468. Therefore, AB \u00b7 AC = c * b =468.\n\nWait, let me recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps.\n\nWe had:\n\n1. Calculated OI using the formula OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr =169 -156=13. So, OI= sqrt(13).\n\n2. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle IOA is right-angled at I, so IA\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = OA\u00b2. OA is R=13, so IA\u00b2 =169 -13=156. Therefore, IA= sqrt(156)=2 sqrt(39).\n\n3. IA is the distance from inradius to vertex A, which is IA = r / sin(A/2). So, 2 sqrt(39) =6 / sin(A/2), leading to sin(A/2)= sqrt(39)/13.\n\n4. Then, using double-angle formula, sin A=2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2)=2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13)=2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\n5. Using Law of Sines, a=2R sin A=2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13)=4 sqrt(30).\n\n6. Then, using tan(A/2)=r/(s -a)=sqrt(30)/10=6/(s -a), leading to s -a=2 sqrt(30). So, s= a +2 sqrt(30)=4 sqrt(30)+2 sqrt(30)=6 sqrt(30).\n\n7. Therefore, the semi-perimeter s=6 sqrt(30), so perimeter=12 sqrt(30), leading to b + c=8 sqrt(30).\n\n8. Area= r*s=6*6 sqrt(30)=36 sqrt(30).\n\n9. Also, Area=(1/2)*b*c*sin A= (1/2)*b*c*(2 sqrt(30)/13)= (b c sqrt(30))/13.\n\n10. Setting equal to area: (b c sqrt(30))/13=36 sqrt(30), leading to b c=468.\n\nSo, the product AB \u00b7 AC is 468. That seems to make sense.\n\nLet me just check if all the steps make sense and I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nWait, step 6: tan(A/2)=sqrt(30)/10=6/(s -a). So, s -a=6/(sqrt(30)/10)=60/sqrt(30)=60 sqrt(30)/30=2 sqrt(30). Correct.\n\nThen, s= a +2 sqrt(30)=4 sqrt(30)+2 sqrt(30)=6 sqrt(30). Correct.\n\nThen, perimeter is 12 sqrt(30), so b +c=8 sqrt(30). Correct.\n\nArea as r*s=6*6 sqrt(30)=36 sqrt(30). Correct.\n\nArea as (1/2)*b*c*sin A: (1/2)*b*c*(2 sqrt(30)/13)= (b c sqrt(30))/13. Correct.\n\nSet equal to 36 sqrt(30): (b c sqrt(30))/13=36 sqrt(30). Divide both sides by sqrt(30): bc/13=36. So, bc=468. Correct.\n\nYes, I think all steps are correct. Therefore, the answer is 468.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting the given conditions: the circumradius \\( R = 13 \\), inradius \\( r = 6 \\), and \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\).

So, we can write:\n\nArea = r*s = (a*b*c)/(4R)\n\nSo, we can write:\n\nr*s = (a*b*c)/(4R)\n\nBut I don't know the semi-perimeter s yet. Also, I don't know the sides a, b, c. So, maybe I need more information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can relate the sides using the sine formula. Since we have the circumradius, we know that a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.\n\nWait, that's correct. The Law of Sines states that a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C = 2R.\n\nSo, a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.\n\nSo, if I can find sin A, sin B, sin C, I can find the sides.\n\nBut I already know sin(A/2) from earlier. Let me think about how to get sin A from sin(A/2).\n\nWe can use the double-angle formula. Remember that sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2). So, if I have sin(A/2) = \u221a39 / 13, then cos(A/2) can be found using the identity sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 = 1.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2(A/2)) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nTherefore, sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(\u221a39/13)*(\u221a130/13) = 2*(\u221a(39*130))/(13*13)\n\nLet me compute 39*130. 39*130 = (40 -1)*130 = 40*130 -130 = 5200 -130 = 5070.\n\nWait, 39*130: 39*100=3900, 39*30=1170, so 3900+1170=5070. So, sqrt(5070). Hmm, 5070 is equal to 5070 = 10 * 507 = 10 * 3 * 169 = 10 * 3 * 13\u00b2. So, sqrt(5070) = sqrt(10 * 3 * 13\u00b2) = 13 * sqrt(30).\n\nWait, let me compute sqrt(5070):\n\n5070 = 10 * 507\n\n507 is 3 * 169 = 3 *13\u00b2\n\nSo, 5070 = 10 * 3 * 13\u00b2\n\nThus, sqrt(5070) = 13 * sqrt(30)\n\nSo, sin A = 2*(13 * sqrt(30)) / (13 *13) )= (26 sqrt(30)) / (169) )= (2 sqrt(30)) /13\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 2*(\u221a39/13)*(\u221a130/13) = 2*(sqrt(39*130))/(13*13) = 2*sqrt(5070)/(169)\n\nBut 5070 = 13\u00b2 *30, so sqrt(5070) =13*sqrt(30). Therefore, it becomes 2*(13 sqrt(30))/(169) = (26 sqrt(30))/169 = (2 sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, sin A is 2\u221a30 /13.\n\nOkay, so now, from the Law of Sines, we can write that:\n\na = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2\u221a30/13) = 2*13*(2\u221a30)/13 = 2*2\u221a30 = 4\u221a30.\n\nWait, let me compute that step by step.\n\na = 2R sin A\n\nR is 13, so 2R is 26.\n\nsin A is 2\u221a30 /13.\n\nSo, a = 26 * (2\u221a30 /13) = (26/13)*2\u221a30 = 2*2\u221a30 =4\u221a30. So, a = 4\u221a30.\n\nSo, side a (BC) is 4\u221a30. Now, I need to find sides b and c, which are AC and AB respectively.\n\nSo, b = AC = 2R sin B\n\nc = AB = 2R sin C\n\nSo, if I can find sin B and sin C, I can find b and c.\n\nBut I know that in any triangle, angles A + B + C = \u03c0 radians (180 degrees). So, B + C = \u03c0 - A.\n\nI also know that in any triangle, the sum of the angles is \u03c0, so maybe we can find relationships between B and C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find another equation involving b and c.\n\nWait, I also know that in a triangle, the product of the sides can be related to the area.\n\nBut perhaps another approach: using the fact that the inradius r = 6, and the area is r*s, where s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nSo, Area = r*s =6*s.\n\nAlso, Area = (a*b*c)/(4R). So,\n\n6*s = (a*b*c)/(4*13) => 6s = (a*b*c)/52 => (a*b*c) = 6*52*s = 312 s.\n\nBut I don't know s yet. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use Heron's formula, which states that Area = sqrt[s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c)].\n\nBut without knowing s, a, b, c, this might not be directly helpful. But maybe I can find another relation.\n\nWait, I also know that in a triangle, tan(A/2) = r / (s - a). Let me recall that.\n\nYes, tan(A/2) = r / (s - a).\n\nWe have sin(A/2) = \u221a39 /13, so cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nTherefore, tan(A/2) = sin(A/2)/cos(A/2) = (\u221a39 /13) / (\u221a130 /13) )= \u221a39 / \u221a130 = sqrt(39/130).\n\nSimplify 39/130: 39 divides by 13, 130 is 13*10. So, 39/130 = 3/10. So, tan(A/2) = sqrt(3/10) = \u221a30 /10.\n\nWait, sqrt(3/10) is equal to sqrt(30)/10. Yes, because sqrt(3/10) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(10) = (sqrt(3)*sqrt(10))/10 = sqrt(30)/10.\n\nSo, tan(A/2) = sqrt(30)/10.\n\nBut tan(A/2) is also equal to r / (s - a), according to the formula.\n\nSo, sqrt(30)/10 = 6 / (s - a)\n\nSolve for (s - a):\n\ns - a = 6 / (sqrt(30)/10) )= 6 * (10 / sqrt(30)) = 60 / sqrt(30) = (60 sqrt(30)) /30 = 2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s - a = 2 sqrt(30).\n\nBut a =4 sqrt(30), so s = a + 2 sqrt(30) =4 sqrt(30) + 2 sqrt(30) =6 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, the semi-perimeter s is 6 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s =6 sqrt(30).\n\nOkay, so now, the semi-perimeter is known. So, s = (a + b + c)/2 =6 sqrt(30).\n\nThus, a + b + c =12 sqrt(30).\n\nWe already know that a =4 sqrt(30), so 4 sqrt(30) + b + c =12 sqrt(30). Therefore, b + c =8 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, now we have that b + c =8 sqrt(30). And we need to find b*c.\n\nSo, if I can find another equation involving b and c, I can solve for b*c.\n\nWe know that in a triangle, the area is equal to r*s, which is 6*6 sqrt(30) =36 sqrt(30).\n\nAlternatively, the area can also be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nWe have sin A =2 sqrt(30)/13, so:\n\nArea = (1/2)*b*c*(2 sqrt(30)/13) )= (b c sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSet this equal to 36 sqrt(30):\n\n(b c sqrt(30))/13 =36 sqrt(30)\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(30):\n\nb c /13 =36\n\nMultiply both sides by13:\n\nb c = 468.\n\nSo, the product of b and c is 468. Therefore, AB \u00b7 AC = c * b =468.\n\nWait, let me recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps.\n\nWe had:\n\n1. Calculated OI using the formula OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr =169 -156=13. So, OI= sqrt(13).\n\n2. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle IOA is right-angled at I, so IA\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = OA\u00b2. OA is R=13, so IA\u00b2 =169 -13=156. Therefore, IA= sqrt(156)=2 sqrt(39).\n\n3. IA is the distance from inradius to vertex A, which is IA = r / sin(A/2). So, 2 sqrt(39) =6 / sin(A/2), leading to sin(A/2)= sqrt(39)/13.\n\n4. Then, using double-angle formula, sin A=2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2)=2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13)=2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\n5. Using Law of Sines, a=2R sin A=2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13)=4 sqrt(30).\n\n6. Then, using tan(A/2)=r/(s -a)=sqrt(30)/10=6/(s -a), leading to s -a=2 sqrt(30). So, s= a +2 sqrt(30)=4 sqrt(30)+2 sqrt(30)=6 sqrt(30).\n\n7. Therefore, the semi-perimeter s=6 sqrt(30), so perimeter=12 sqrt(30), leading to b + c=8 sqrt(30).\n\n8. Area= r*s=6*6 sqrt(30)=36 sqrt(30).\n\n9. Also, Area=(1/2)*b*c*sin A= (1/2)*b*c*(2 sqrt(30)/13)= (b c sqrt(30))/13.\n\n10. Setting equal to area: (b c sqrt(30))/13=36 sqrt(30), leading to b c=468.\n\nSo, the product AB \u00b7 AC is 468. That seems to make sense.\n\nLet me just check if all the steps make sense and I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nWait, step 6: tan(A/2)=sqrt(30)/10=6/(s -a). So, s -a=6/(sqrt(30)/10)=60/sqrt(30)=60 sqrt(30)/30=2 sqrt(30). Correct.\n\nThen, s= a +2 sqrt(30)=4 sqrt(30)+2 sqrt(30)=6 sqrt(30). Correct.\n\nThen, perimeter is 12 sqrt(30), so b +c=8 sqrt(30). Correct.\n\nArea as r*s=6*6 sqrt(30)=36 sqrt(30). Correct.\n\nArea as (1/2)*b*c*sin A: (1/2)*b*c*(2 sqrt(30)/13)= (b c sqrt(30))/13. Correct.\n\nSet equal to 36 sqrt(30): (b c sqrt(30))/13=36 sqrt(30). Divide both sides by sqrt(30): bc/13=36. So, bc=468. Correct.\n\nYes, I think all steps are correct. Therefore, the answer is 468.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting the given conditions: the circumradius \\( R = 13 \\), inradius \\( r = 6 \\), and \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\). We use the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter, \\( OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \\), which gives \\( OI^2 = 13^2 - 2 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 6 = 169 - 156 = 13 \\), so \\( OI = \\sqrt{13} \\).\n\nSince \\( \\overline{IA} \\) is perpendicular to \\( \\overline{OI} \\), triangle \\( IOA \\) is right-angled at \\( I \\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find \\( IA \\):\n\\[\nIA^2 + OI^2 = OA^2 \\implies IA^2 + 13 = 13^2 \\implies IA^2 = 156 \\implies IA = 2\\sqrt{39}.\n\\]\n\nThe distance from the incenter to vertex \\( A \\) is given by \\( IA = \\frac{r}{\\sin(A/2)} \\). Substituting \\( IA = 2\\sqrt{39} \\) and \\( r = 6 \\):\n\\[\n2\\sqrt{39} = \\frac{6}{\\sin(A/2)} \\implies \\sin(A/2) = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{39}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the double-angle identity for sine, \\( \\sin A = 2 \\sin(A/2) \\cos(A/2) \\), and knowing \\( \\cos(A/2) = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2(A/2)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{130}}{13} \\), we find:\n\\[\n\\sin A = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{130}}{13} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the Law of Sines, \\( a = 2R \\sin A \\), where \\( a = BC \\):\n\\[\na = 2 \\cdot 13 \\cdot \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13} = 4\\sqrt{30}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the formula \\( \\tan(A/2) = \\frac{r}{s - a} \\), where \\( s \\) is the semi-perimeter. We find:\n\\[\n\\tan(A/2) = \\frac{\\sqrt{30}}{10} = \\frac{6}{s - a} \\implies s - a = 2\\sqrt{30}.\n\\]\nThus, \\( s = a + 2\\sqrt{30} = 4\\sqrt{30} + 2\\sqrt{30} = 6\\sqrt{30} \\), so the perimeter is \\( 12\\sqrt{30} \\), and \\( b + c = 8\\sqrt{30} \\).\n\nThe area of the triangle is \\( r \\cdot s = 6 \\cdot 6\\sqrt{30} = 36\\sqrt{30} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:\n\nLet triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC, so AB\u00b7AC.\n\nHmm. Alright, let's jot down what we know.\n\nFirst, triangle ABC has a circumradius R = 13. That's the radius of the circumscribed circle. The inradius is r = 6. The inradius is the radius of the inscribed circle.\n\nThe incenter I is the point where the angle bisectors meet, and the circumcenter O is where the perpendicular bisectors meet. In some triangles, like equilateral ones, O and I coincide, but in general, they're different.\n\nThe key piece of information here is that IA is perpendicular to OI. So the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line connecting the incenter I and the circumcenter O.\n\nI think I need to use some properties of triangle centers and maybe some formulas relating the inradius, circumradius, and other triangle properties.\n\nLet me recall some formulas:\n\n1. The formula relating the inradius, area, and semiperimeter: r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semiperimeter.\n\n2. The formula for the circumradius: R = (a*b*c)/(4*A), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.\n\n3. The distance between the incenter and circumcenter: OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that right? Let me think. I remember there's a formula that relates OI, R, and r. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Hmm, wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no. The correct formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, actually, I think that's correct. Let me verify with a quick derivation.\n\nI recall that in triangle ABC, OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr.\n\nGiven R = 13 and r = 6, so OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6.\n\nCalculating that: 169 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI\u00b2 = 13, meaning OI = sqrt(13).\n\nAlright, so the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(13).\n\nNow, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, triangle IOA is right-angled at I.\n\nTherefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, IA\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = OA\u00b2.\n\nBut OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, OA = 13.\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 + (sqrt(13))\u00b2 = 13\u00b2.\n\nCalculating that: IA\u00b2 + 13 = 169. So, IA\u00b2 = 169 - 13 = 156. Therefore, IA = sqrt(156). Simplify sqrt(156): sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). So IA = 2\u221a39.\n\nSo, the length of IA is 2\u221a39.\n\nBut what is IA? IA is the distance from the incenter I to vertex A. There's a formula for the length of the inradius from the incenter to a vertex.\n\nWait, yes, the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex is sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2), where s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. I think the formula is IA = \u221a(r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2). Similarly, IB = \u221a(r\u00b2 + (s - b)\u00b2), and IC = \u221a(r\u00b2 + (s - c)\u00b2).\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2.\n\nWe know IA\u00b2 is 156, and r is 6. So, 156 = 6\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2.\n\nCalculating 6\u00b2 = 36, so (s - a)\u00b2 = 156 - 36 = 120. Therefore, s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nWait, but s is the semiperimeter, which is (a + b + c)/2.\n\nHmm, so s - a = (a + b + c)/2 - a = (-a + b + c)/2. So, s - a = (b + c - a)/2.\n\nSo, (b + c - a)/2 = 2*sqrt(30). Therefore, b + c - a = 4*sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, that's one equation. But we have three variables: a, b, c. We need more information.\n\nWait, let's think about what we need to find: AB\u00b7AC. AB is the side opposite to C, which is c, and AC is the side opposite to B, which is b. So, AB\u00b7AC = c\u00b7b. So, we need to find b*c.\n\nWait, so if I can find expressions for b and c, perhaps I can find their product.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me recall that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the area and the sine of the included angle. But I don't know the angles here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the area in terms of inradius and semiperimeter: A = r*s.\n\nWe know r is 6, so A = 6s.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed as (a*b*c)/(4R). Since R is 13, so A = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, a*b*c = 6s *52 = 312 s.\n\nHmm, so a*b*c = 312 s.\n\nBut I don't know s or a, b, c yet.\n\nWait, another thought. The formula for the distance from the inradius to a vertex: IA = \u221a(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2). We've already used that.\n\nWe also have the formula for the area: A = r*s.\n\nAnd the formula for the circumradius: R = a/(2*sin A). Similarly for other sides and angles.\n\nWait, maybe we can relate IA to other elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps coordinate geometry can help. Let me try to set up a coordinate system.\n\nLet me place point I at the origin (0,0), since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is the line connecting O and I.\n\nWait, no. If IA is perpendicular to OI, and O is the circumradius, perhaps we can set up a coordinate system where I is at (0,0), and O is along the x-axis.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nLet me assume point I is at (0,0). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is a line from I to O, so O lies somewhere on the x-axis, say at (d, 0), because OI is along the x-axis. Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, IA must be along the y-axis.\n\nBut wait, IA is from I to A, so point A must lie somewhere along the y-axis. So, point A is at (0, y) for some y.\n\nSo, in this coordinate system:\n\n- I is at (0,0)\n- O is at (d, 0)\n- A is at (0, y)\n\nWe know that O is the circumradius center, so OA is the distance from O to A, which is the circumradius, 13. So, OA = sqrt( (0 - d)^2 + (y - 0)^2 ) = sqrt(d\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 13.\n\nSo, d\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 169.\n\nWe also know that the inradius is 6. The inradius is the distance from the incenter I to any side. In this coordinate system, since I is at (0,0), and the sides are tangent to the incircle.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about other properties.\n\nWait, since we have OI\u00b2 = 13, as we calculated earlier, so OI is sqrt(13). In our coordinate system, O is at (d,0), I is at (0,0), so OI is sqrt(d\u00b2 + 0) = |d| = sqrt(13). So, d = sqrt(13) or -sqrt(13). Let's take d = sqrt(13) for simplicity, so O is at (sqrt(13), 0).\n\nSo, OA is 13, so sqrt( (sqrt(13))\u00b2 + y\u00b2 ) = 13. So, sqrt(13 + y\u00b2) = 13. Therefore, 13 + y\u00b2 = 169, so y\u00b2 = 156, so y = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). So, point A is at (0, 2\u221a39).\n\nSo, A is at (0, 2\u221a39). Now, let's think about the coordinates of points B and C.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too involved. Let me see if I can find another approach.\n\nWait, another thought: in triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is IA, which we found to be 2\u221a39. There's a formula that relates IA, the inradius, the semiperimeter, and the sides.\n\nWait, earlier I mentioned IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2. So, 156 = 6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2, which gives (s - a)^2 = 120, so s - a = 2\u221a30.\n\nSo, s - a = 2\u221a30.\n\nSimilarly, s - b = distance from I to B, but we don't have that. Hmm.\n\nWait, but perhaps if I can find s in terms of a, b, c. Since s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nAlso, the area A = r*s = 6s.\n\nAlso, A = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a*b*c)/52, which implies a*b*c = 312 s.\n\nHmm, so a*b*c = 312 s.\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2, so a*b*c = 312*(a + b + c)/2 = 156*(a + b + c).\n\nSo, a*b*c = 156(a + b + c).\n\nHmm, that's a relation, but I don't know if that helps directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find another equation involving a, b, c.\n\nWe know that s - a = 2\u221a30. So, s - a = (a + b + c)/2 - a = (-a + b + c)/2 = 2\u221a30.\n\nSo, (-a + b + c) = 4\u221a30.\n\nSimilarly, if I can find s - b and s - c, but I don't have information about IB or IC.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can use the formula for the area in another way.\n\nWait, maybe using Heron's formula: A = sqrt( s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) )\n\nBut we know A = 6s, so:\n\n6s = sqrt( s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) )\n\nSquaring both sides: 36 s\u00b2 = s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)\n\nDivide both sides by s: 36 s = (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)\n\nHmm, so (s - a)(s - b)(s - c) = 36 s.\n\nBut we know that s - a = 2\u221a30, as we found earlier.\n\nSo, 2\u221a30 * (s - b)(s - c) = 36 s.\n\nHmm, but I don't know s - b or s - c. So, not sure if this helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can relate sides a, b, c with the sine formula.\n\nWe know that a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.\n\nSo, a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSince R =13, so 2R =26.\n\nSo, a, b, c are proportional to sin A, sin B, sin C.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can find a relation between the angles.\n\nAlso, in a triangle, angles sum to 180 degrees, so A + B + C = \u03c0 radians.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure how that helps yet.\n\nWait, but we also have the inradius formula: r = 4R sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2).\n\nWait, is that right? Let me recall.\n\nYes, the formula for the inradius is r = 4R sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2).\n\nSo, given r = 6, R =13, so 6 = 4*13 sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2).\n\nSo, 6 = 52 sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2).\n\nTherefore, sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2) = 6/52 = 3/26.\n\nHmm, that might be useful later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find expressions for (s - a), (s - b), (s - c).\n\nWe know that (s - a) = 2\u221a30.\n\nAlso, from the formula, (s - a) = r / (cot(A/2)).\n\nWait, because in a triangle, (s - a) = r / (cot(A/2)).\n\nWait, no, let me think. The formula for (s - a) is actually equal to r / tan(A/2).\n\nWait, perhaps I should recall the formula correctly.\n\nYes, in triangle ABC, (s - a) = r / tan(A/2).\n\nSimilarly, (s - b) = r / tan(B/2), and (s - c) = r / tan(C/2).\n\nSo, since (s - a) = 2\u221a30, and r =6, so 2\u221a30 = 6 / tan(A/2).\n\nSo, tan(A/2) = 6 / (2\u221a30) = 3 / \u221a30 = \u221a30 / 10.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3 / \u221a30. Rationalizing the denominator: 3\u221a30 / 30 = \u221a30 / 10.\n\nSo, tan(A/2) = \u221a30 / 10.\n\nSimilarly, we can find expressions for tan(B/2) and tan(C/2), but we don't have (s - b) or (s - c).\n\nAlternatively, since A + B + C = \u03c0, maybe we can relate the tangents of their halves.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too involved.\n\nWait, another idea: The product (s - a)(s - b)(s - c) can be expressed in terms of r and R.\n\nWe have (s - a)(s - b)(s - c) = r\u00b2 s / (4R).\n\nWait, I'm not sure about that. Let me think.\n\nWait, from Heron's formula, we have A = sqrt( s (s - a)(s - b)(s - c) ). We also know that A = r s.\n\nSo, (s - a)(s - b)(s - c) = (A\u00b2) / s = (r\u00b2 s\u00b2) / s = r\u00b2 s.\n\nSo, (s - a)(s - b)(s - c) = r\u00b2 s.\n\nGiven that, and since we know (s - a) = 2\u221a30, and r=6, s is something.\n\nSo, 2\u221a30 * (s - b)(s - c) = (6)^2 * s = 36 s.\n\nSo, (s - b)(s - c) = (36 s) / (2\u221a30) )= 18 s / \u221a30.\n\nHmm, but I don't know s or (s - b) or (s - c).\n\nWait, but from earlier, s - a = 2\u221a30. So, s = a + 2\u221a30.\n\nHmm, maybe we can express s in terms of a.\n\nWait, s = (a + b + c)/2. So, s = a + 2\u221a30.\n\nBut that implies that (a + b + c)/2 = a + 2\u221a30.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2: a + b + c = 2a + 4\u221a30.\n\nSo, b + c = a + 4\u221a30.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, b + c = a + 4\u221a30.\n\nBut we also know from the tangent of A/2 that tan(A/2) = \u221a30 /10.\n\nLet me recall that tan(A/2) = (r) / (s - a).\n\nWait, yes, because (s - a) = r / tan(A/2).\n\nSo, as we had earlier, (s - a) = r / tan(A/2) = 6 / ( \u221a30 /10 ) = 6 * 10 / \u221a30 = 60 / \u221a30 = 60\u221a30 / 30 = 2\u221a30. Which matches our earlier result. So, that checks out.\n\nHmm, maybe I can find expressions for other sides.\n\nWait, from the sine formula, a = 26 sin A, b =26 sin B, c=26 sin C.\n\nAlso, A + B + C = \u03c0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can relate angles.\n\nBut without knowing specific angles, this might not help directly.\n\nWait, another thought: The formula for the area is A = r*s = 6s, and also A = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a*b*c)/52 \u2192 a*b*c = 312 s.\n\nBut we also have from earlier that a*b*c = 312 s, and we have s = a + 2\u221a30.\n\nSo, a*b*c = 312 (a + 2\u221a30).\n\nHmm, but without knowing a, this is tricky.\n\nWait, maybe we can find a in terms of s.\n\nWait, s = a + 2\u221a30, so a = s - 2\u221a30.\n\nSo, a*b*c = 312 s.\n\nBut also, a = 26 sin A, b =26 sin B, c=26 sin C.\n\nSo, a*b*c = 26\u00b3 sin A sin B sin C.\n\nSo, 26\u00b3 sin A sin B sin C = 312 s.\n\nBut 26\u00b3 is 26*26*26 = 17,576.\n\nSo, 17,576 sin A sin B sin C = 312 s.\n\nDividing both sides by 312: (17,576 / 312) sin A sin B sin C = s.\n\nCalculating 17,576 \u00f7 312: Let's see, 312*56 = 17,472, and 17,576 -17,472=104. 104 is 312*(104/312)=1/3. So, 56 + 1/3 = 56.333...\n\nSo, 17,576 /312 = 56.333... which is 169/3. Because 169*3=507, 507*10=5070, 5070*3=15,210. Wait, no, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, 312 = 24*13. 17,576 \u00f7 24 = 732.333... Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nWait, 17,576 \u00f7 312:\n\n312 * 50 = 15,600\n\n17,576 -15,600=1,976\n\n312*6=1,872\n\n1,976-1,872=104\n\n312*0.333=104.\n\nSo, total is 50 +6 +0.333=56.333... which is 56 and 1/3, which is 169/3.\n\nWait, because 56.333... is 169/3. Since 56*3=168, plus 1 is 169.\n\nYes, so 17,576 /312 = 169/3.\n\nSo, 169/3 sin A sin B sin C = s.\n\nBut from earlier, we had r = 4R sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2).\n\nWhich is 6 = 4*13 sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2) \u2192 6 =52 sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2).\n\nSo, sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2) = 6/52 = 3/26.\n\nHmm, and I know that sin A sin B sin C can be expressed in terms of sin(A/2) etc.\n\nBut this might be getting too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula that relates sin A sin B sin C with other terms.\n\nWait, in a triangle, sin A sin B sin C = (a b c)/(8 R\u00b3).\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWe know that a = 2R sin A, b =2R sin B, c=2R sin C.\n\nSo, a b c = 8 R\u00b3 sin A sin B sin C.\n\nSo, sin A sin B sin C = (a b c)/(8 R\u00b3).\n\nBut we have a b c = 312 s.\n\nSo, sin A sin B sin C = (312 s)/(8 *13\u00b3).\n\nCalculating 13\u00b3: 13*13=169, 169*13=2197.\n\nSo, 8*2197=17,576.\n\nSo, sin A sin B sin C = (312 s)/17,576 = (312/17,576) s.\n\nSimplify 312/17,576: Let's see, both divided by 8: 39/2197.\n\nHmm, 2197 is 13\u00b3, so 2197=13*13*13.\n\n39 is 3*13. So, 39/2197= 3/(13\u00b2)=3/169.\n\nSo, sin A sin B sin C = (3/169) s.\n\nEarlier, we had 169/3 sin A sin B sin C = s.\n\nSo, substituting, 169/3 * (3/169) s = s \u2192 s = s.\n\nHmm, that's a tautology, so it doesn't give new information.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm going in circles here.\n\nWait, another idea: Let's consider the formula for the distance from the inradius to the vertex.\n\nWe have IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 = 6\u00b2 + (2\u221a30)^2 = 36 + 120 = 156, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, that doesn't give new info.\n\nWait, perhaps I can relate the sides using the fact that b + c = a + 4\u221a30.\n\nSo, b + c = a + 4\u221a30.\n\nBut we also know that a*b*c = 312 s, and s = a + 2\u221a30.\n\nSo, a*b*c = 312(a + 2\u221a30).\n\nBut we have three variables: a, b, c. And we also have b + c = a +4\u221a30.\n\nHmm, but we need another equation.\n\nWait, perhaps using the Law of Cosines.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, cos A = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2)/(2bc).\n\nBut I don't know angle A or the sides, so not sure.\n\nWait, but maybe we can find cos A in terms of other variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express b and c in terms of a.\n\nWait, since b + c = a +4\u221a30, let's denote b + c = a +4\u221a30.\n\nLet me denote S = b + c = a +4\u221a30.\n\nAlso, from the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nHmm, but without knowing cos A, this might not help.\n\nWait, but from the formula, we have tan(A/2) = \u221a30 /10.\n\nWe can find sin A and cos A from tan(A/2).\n\nBecause tan(A/2) = \u221a30 /10.\n\nSo, tan(A/2) = t = \u221a30 /10.\n\nThen, sin A = 2t/(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nt = \u221a30 /10.\n\nt\u00b2 = 30 /100 = 3/10.\n\nSo, sin A = 2*(\u221a30/10) / (1 + 3/10) = (2\u221a30 /10) / (13/10) = (2\u221a30 /10) * (10/13) )= 2\u221a30 /13.\n\nSimilarly, cos A = (1 - t\u00b2)/(1 + t\u00b2) = (1 - 3/10)/(1 +3/10) = (7/10)/(13/10) =7/13.\n\nSo, sin A = 2\u221a30 /13, cos A=7/13.\n\nSo, now, from the Law of Cosines:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nWhich is a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13).\n\nBut we can write this as a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nHmm, but we also have that b + c = a +4\u221a30.\n\nLet me square both sides of b + c = a +4\u221a30.\n\nSo, (b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + 8\u221a30 a + 16*30 = a\u00b2 +8\u221a30 a +480.\n\nBut (b + c)^2 = b\u00b2 + 2bc + c\u00b2.\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\nb\u00b2 + 2bc + c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 +8\u221a30 a +480.\n\nBut from the Law of Cosines, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nSo, substitute a\u00b2 into the equation:\n\nb\u00b2 + 2bc + c\u00b2 = [b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc] +8\u221a30 a +480.\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc +8\u221a30 a +480.\n\nSo, subtracting left side from both sides:\n\n0 = - (14/13) bc +8\u221a30 a +480 - 2bc.\n\nWait, let's bring everything to one side.\n\nWait, wait, let's subtract the right side from the left side:\n\n(b\u00b2 + 2bc + c\u00b2) - [b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc +8\u221a30 a +480] =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\nb\u00b2 +2bc +c\u00b2 -b\u00b2 -c\u00b2 + (14/13) bc -8\u221a30 a -480=0.\n\nSo, 2bc + (14/13) bc -8\u221a30 a -480=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(2 +14/13) bc -8\u221a30 a -480=0.\n\nConvert 2 to 26/13: 26/13 +14/13=40/13.\n\nSo, (40/13) bc -8\u221a30 a -480=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 13 to eliminate denominator:\n\n40 bc -104\u221a30 a -6240=0.\n\nSo, 40 bc =104\u221a30 a +6240.\n\nDivide both sides by 8 to simplify:\n\n5 bc =13\u221a30 a +780.\n\nSo, 5 bc =13\u221a30 a +780.\n\nHmm, so we have 5 bc =13\u221a30 a +780.\n\nBut from earlier, we have a*b*c =312 s, and s =a +2\u221a30.\n\nSo, a*b*c =312(a +2\u221a30).\n\nSo, bc = [312(a +2\u221a30)] /a.\n\nSo, bc = 312 (a +2\u221a30)/a.\n\nSo, substituting bc into the equation 5 bc =13\u221a30 a +780.\n\nSo, 5*(312 (a +2\u221a30)/a) )=13\u221a30 a +780.\n\nCompute 5*312=1560.\n\nSo, 1560 (a +2\u221a30)/a =13\u221a30 a +780.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n1560 (1 + 2\u221a30 /a ) =13\u221a30 a +780.\n\nDivide both sides by 13 to simplify:\n\n1560 /13 =120.\n\nSo, 120 (1 + 2\u221a30 /a ) = \u221a30 a +60.\n\nSo, 120 + 240\u221a30 /a = \u221a30 a +60.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n120 +240\u221a30 /a -\u221a30 a -60=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n60 +240\u221a30 /a -\u221a30 a=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by a to eliminate denominator:\n\n60a +240\u221a30 -\u221a30 a\u00b2=0.\n\nRearrange:\n\n-\u221a30 a\u00b2 +60a +240\u221a30=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n\u221a30 a\u00b2 -60a -240\u221a30=0.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of a:\n\n\u221a30 a\u00b2 -60a -240\u221a30=0.\n\nLet me divide all terms by \u221a30 to simplify:\n\na\u00b2 - (60 /\u221a30 ) a -240=0.\n\nSimplify 60/\u221a30: 60 /\u221a30 = (60\u221a30)/30 =2\u221a30.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2 -2\u221a30 a -240=0.\n\nSo, quadratic equation: a\u00b2 -2\u221a30 a -240=0.\n\nLet me solve for a using quadratic formula.\n\na = [2\u221a30 \u00b1 sqrt( (2\u221a30)^2 +4*240 ) ] /2.\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n(2\u221a30)^2 =4*30=120.\n\n4*240=960.\n\nSo, sqrt(120 +960)=sqrt(1080).\n\nSimplify sqrt(1080): sqrt(36*30)=6\u221a30.\n\nSo, a = [2\u221a30 \u00b16\u221a30 ] /2.\n\nSo, two possibilities:\n\na = [2\u221a30 +6\u221a30 ] /2 = (8\u221a30)/2=4\u221a30.\n\nOr a = [2\u221a30 -6\u221a30 ] /2 = (-4\u221a30)/2= -2\u221a30.\n\nBut a is a length, so it can't be negative. So, a=4\u221a30.\n\nSo, a=4\u221a30.\n\nNow, we can find s from earlier: s =a +2\u221a30=4\u221a30 +2\u221a30=6\u221a30.\n\nSo, s=6\u221a30.\n\nThen, a*b*c=312 s=312 *6\u221a30=1872\u221a30.\n\nBut we can also compute bc from earlier.\n\nFrom bc=312(a +2\u221a30)/a.\n\nSubstitute a=4\u221a30:\n\nbc=312*(4\u221a30 +2\u221a30)/4\u221a30=312*(6\u221a30)/4\u221a30.\n\nSimplify:\n\n312*(6\u221a30)/(4\u221a30)=312*6/4=312*(3/2)=468.\n\nSo, bc=468.\n\nTherefore, AB\u00b7AC =b*c=468.\n\nWait, so the answer is 468.\n\nLet me just check the steps quickly to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\n1.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:\n\nLet triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC, so AB\u00b7AC.\n\nHmm. Alright, let's jot down what we know.\n\nFirst, triangle ABC has a circumradius R = 13. That's the radius of the circumscribed circle. The inradius is r = 6. The inradius is the radius of the inscribed circle.\n\nThe incenter I is the point where the angle bisectors meet, and the circumcenter O is where the perpendicular bisectors meet. In some triangles, like equilateral ones, O and I coincide, but in general, they're different.\n\nThe key piece of information here is that IA is perpendicular to OI. So the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line connecting the incenter I and the circumcenter O.\n\nI think I need to use some properties of triangle centers and maybe some formulas relating the inradius, circumradius, and other triangle properties.\n\nLet me recall some formulas:\n\n1. The formula relating the inradius, area, and semiperimeter: r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semiperimeter.\n\n2. The formula for the circumradius: R = (a*b*c)/(4*A), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.\n\n3. The distance between the incenter and circumcenter: OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that right? Let me think. I remember there's a formula that relates OI, R, and r. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Hmm, wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no. The correct formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, actually, I think that's correct. Let me verify with a quick derivation.\n\nI recall that in triangle ABC, OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr.\n\nGiven R = 13 and r = 6, so OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6.\n\nCalculating that: 169 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI\u00b2 = 13, meaning OI = sqrt(13).\n\nAlright, so the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(13).\n\nNow, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, triangle IOA is right-angled at I.\n\nTherefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, IA\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = OA\u00b2.\n\nBut OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, OA = 13.\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 + (sqrt(13))\u00b2 = 13\u00b2.\n\nCalculating that: IA\u00b2 + 13 = 169. So, IA\u00b2 = 169 - 13 = 156. Therefore, IA = sqrt(156). Simplify sqrt(156): sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). So IA = 2\u221a39.\n\nSo, the length of IA is 2\u221a39.\n\nBut what is IA? IA is the distance from the incenter I to vertex A. There's a formula for the length of the inradius from the incenter to a vertex.\n\nWait, yes, the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex is sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2), where s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. I think the formula is IA = \u221a(r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2). Similarly, IB = \u221a(r\u00b2 + (s - b)\u00b2), and IC = \u221a(r\u00b2 + (s - c)\u00b2).\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2.\n\nWe know IA\u00b2 is 156, and r is 6. So, 156 = 6\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2.\n\nCalculating 6\u00b2 = 36, so (s - a)\u00b2 = 156 - 36 = 120. Therefore, s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nWait, but s is the semiperimeter, which is (a + b + c)/2.\n\nHmm, so s - a = (a + b + c)/2 - a = (-a + b + c)/2. So, s - a = (b + c - a)/2.\n\nSo, (b + c - a)/2 = 2*sqrt(30). Therefore, b + c - a = 4*sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, that's one equation. But we have three variables: a, b, c. We need more information.\n\nWait, let's think about what we need to find: AB\u00b7AC. AB is the side opposite to C, which is c, and AC is the side opposite to B, which is b. So, AB\u00b7AC = c\u00b7b. So, we need to find b*c.\n\nWait, so if I can find expressions for b and c, perhaps I can find their product.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me recall that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the area and the sine of the included angle. But I don't know the angles here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the area in terms of inradius and semiperimeter: A = r*s.\n\nWe know r is 6, so A = 6s.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed as (a*b*c)/(4R). Since R is 13, so A = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, a*b*c = 6s *52 = 312 s.\n\nHmm, so a*b*c = 312 s.\n\nBut I don't know s or a, b, c yet.\n\nWait, another thought. The formula for the distance from the inradius to a vertex: IA = \u221a(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2). We've already used that.\n\nWe also have the formula for the area: A = r*s.\n\nAnd the formula for the circumradius: R = a/(2*sin A). Similarly for other sides and angles.\n\nWait, maybe we can relate IA to other elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps coordinate geometry can help. Let me try to set up a coordinate system.\n\nLet me place point I at the origin (0,0), since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is the line connecting O and I.\n\nWait, no. If IA is perpendicular to OI, and O is the circumradius, perhaps we can set up a coordinate system where I is at (0,0), and O is along the x-axis.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nLet me assume point I is at (0,0). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is a line from I to O, so O lies somewhere on the x-axis, say at (d, 0), because OI is along the x-axis. Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, IA must be along the y-axis.\n\nBut wait, IA is from I to A, so point A must lie somewhere along the y-axis. So, point A is at (0, y) for some y.\n\nSo, in this coordinate system:\n\n- I is at (0,0)\n- O is at (d, 0)\n- A is at (0, y)\n\nWe know that O is the circumradius center, so OA is the distance from O to A, which is the circumradius, 13. So, OA = sqrt( (0 - d)^2 + (y - 0)^2 ) = sqrt(d\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 13.\n\nSo, d\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 169.\n\nWe also know that the inradius is 6. The inradius is the distance from the incenter I to any side. In this coordinate system, since I is at (0,0), and the sides are tangent to the incircle.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about other properties.\n\nWait, since we have OI\u00b2 = 13, as we calculated earlier, so OI is sqrt(13). In our coordinate system, O is at (d,0), I is at (0,0), so OI is sqrt(d\u00b2 + 0) = |d| = sqrt(13). So, d = sqrt(13) or -sqrt(13). Let's take d = sqrt(13) for simplicity, so O is at (sqrt(13), 0).\n\nSo, OA is 13, so sqrt( (sqrt(13))\u00b2 + y\u00b2 ) = 13. So, sqrt(13 + y\u00b2) = 13. Therefore, 13 + y\u00b2 = 169, so y\u00b2 = 156, so y = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). So, point A is at (0, 2\u221a39).\n\nSo, A is at (0, 2\u221a39). Now, let's think about the coordinates of points B and C.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too involved. Let me see if I can find another approach.\n\nWait, another thought: in triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is IA, which we found to be 2\u221a39. There's a formula that relates IA, the inradius, the semiperimeter, and the sides.\n\nWait, earlier I mentioned IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2. So, 156 = 6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2, which gives (s - a)^2 = 120, so s - a = 2\u221a30.\n\nSo, s - a = 2\u221a30.\n\nSimilarly, s - b = distance from I to B, but we don't have that. Hmm.\n\nWait, but perhaps if I can find s in terms of a, b, c. Since s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nAlso, the area A = r*s = 6s.\n\nAlso, A = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a*b*c)/52, which implies a*b*c = 312 s.\n\nHmm, so a*b*c = 312 s.\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2, so a*b*c = 312*(a + b + c)/2 = 156*(a + b + c).\n\nSo, a*b*c = 156(a + b + c).\n\nHmm, that's a relation, but I don't know if that helps directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find another equation involving a, b, c.\n\nWe know that s - a = 2\u221a30. So, s - a = (a + b + c)/2 - a = (-a + b + c)/2 = 2\u221a30.\n\nSo, (-a + b + c) = 4\u221a30.\n\nSimilarly, if I can find s - b and s - c, but I don't have information about IB or IC.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can use the formula for the area in another way.\n\nWait, maybe using Heron's formula: A = sqrt( s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) )\n\nBut we know A = 6s, so:\n\n6s = sqrt( s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) )\n\nSquaring both sides: 36 s\u00b2 = s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)\n\nDivide both sides by s: 36 s = (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)\n\nHmm, so (s - a)(s - b)(s - c) = 36 s.\n\nBut we know that s - a = 2\u221a30, as we found earlier.\n\nSo, 2\u221a30 * (s - b)(s - c) = 36 s.\n\nHmm, but I don't know s - b or s - c. So, not sure if this helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can relate sides a, b, c with the sine formula.\n\nWe know that a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.\n\nSo, a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSince R =13, so 2R =26.\n\nSo, a, b, c are proportional to sin A, sin B, sin C.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can find a relation between the angles.\n\nAlso, in a triangle, angles sum to 180 degrees, so A + B + C = \u03c0 radians.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure how that helps yet.\n\nWait, but we also have the inradius formula: r = 4R sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2).\n\nWait, is that right? Let me recall.\n\nYes, the formula for the inradius is r = 4R sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2).\n\nSo, given r = 6, R =13, so 6 = 4*13 sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2).\n\nSo, 6 = 52 sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2).\n\nTherefore, sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2) = 6/52 = 3/26.\n\nHmm, that might be useful later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find expressions for (s - a), (s - b), (s - c).\n\nWe know that (s - a) = 2\u221a30.\n\nAlso, from the formula, (s - a) = r / (cot(A/2)).\n\nWait, because in a triangle, (s - a) = r / (cot(A/2)).\n\nWait, no, let me think. The formula for (s - a) is actually equal to r / tan(A/2).\n\nWait, perhaps I should recall the formula correctly.\n\nYes, in triangle ABC, (s - a) = r / tan(A/2).\n\nSimilarly, (s - b) = r / tan(B/2), and (s - c) = r / tan(C/2).\n\nSo, since (s - a) = 2\u221a30, and r =6, so 2\u221a30 = 6 / tan(A/2).\n\nSo, tan(A/2) = 6 / (2\u221a30) = 3 / \u221a30 = \u221a30 / 10.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3 / \u221a30. Rationalizing the denominator: 3\u221a30 / 30 = \u221a30 / 10.\n\nSo, tan(A/2) = \u221a30 / 10.\n\nSimilarly, we can find expressions for tan(B/2) and tan(C/2), but we don't have (s - b) or (s - c).\n\nAlternatively, since A + B + C = \u03c0, maybe we can relate the tangents of their halves.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too involved.\n\nWait, another idea: The product (s - a)(s - b)(s - c) can be expressed in terms of r and R.\n\nWe have (s - a)(s - b)(s - c) = r\u00b2 s / (4R).\n\nWait, I'm not sure about that. Let me think.\n\nWait, from Heron's formula, we have A = sqrt( s (s - a)(s - b)(s - c) ). We also know that A = r s.\n\nSo, (s - a)(s - b)(s - c) = (A\u00b2) / s = (r\u00b2 s\u00b2) / s = r\u00b2 s.\n\nSo, (s - a)(s - b)(s - c) = r\u00b2 s.\n\nGiven that, and since we know (s - a) = 2\u221a30, and r=6, s is something.\n\nSo, 2\u221a30 * (s - b)(s - c) = (6)^2 * s = 36 s.\n\nSo, (s - b)(s - c) = (36 s) / (2\u221a30) )= 18 s / \u221a30.\n\nHmm, but I don't know s or (s - b) or (s - c).\n\nWait, but from earlier, s - a = 2\u221a30. So, s = a + 2\u221a30.\n\nHmm, maybe we can express s in terms of a.\n\nWait, s = (a + b + c)/2. So, s = a + 2\u221a30.\n\nBut that implies that (a + b + c)/2 = a + 2\u221a30.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2: a + b + c = 2a + 4\u221a30.\n\nSo, b + c = a + 4\u221a30.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, b + c = a + 4\u221a30.\n\nBut we also know from the tangent of A/2 that tan(A/2) = \u221a30 /10.\n\nLet me recall that tan(A/2) = (r) / (s - a).\n\nWait, yes, because (s - a) = r / tan(A/2).\n\nSo, as we had earlier, (s - a) = r / tan(A/2) = 6 / ( \u221a30 /10 ) = 6 * 10 / \u221a30 = 60 / \u221a30 = 60\u221a30 / 30 = 2\u221a30. Which matches our earlier result. So, that checks out.\n\nHmm, maybe I can find expressions for other sides.\n\nWait, from the sine formula, a = 26 sin A, b =26 sin B, c=26 sin C.\n\nAlso, A + B + C = \u03c0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can relate angles.\n\nBut without knowing specific angles, this might not help directly.\n\nWait, another thought: The formula for the area is A = r*s = 6s, and also A = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a*b*c)/52 \u2192 a*b*c = 312 s.\n\nBut we also have from earlier that a*b*c = 312 s, and we have s = a + 2\u221a30.\n\nSo, a*b*c = 312 (a + 2\u221a30).\n\nHmm, but without knowing a, this is tricky.\n\nWait, maybe we can find a in terms of s.\n\nWait, s = a + 2\u221a30, so a = s - 2\u221a30.\n\nSo, a*b*c = 312 s.\n\nBut also, a = 26 sin A, b =26 sin B, c=26 sin C.\n\nSo, a*b*c = 26\u00b3 sin A sin B sin C.\n\nSo, 26\u00b3 sin A sin B sin C = 312 s.\n\nBut 26\u00b3 is 26*26*26 = 17,576.\n\nSo, 17,576 sin A sin B sin C = 312 s.\n\nDividing both sides by 312: (17,576 / 312) sin A sin B sin C = s.\n\nCalculating 17,576 \u00f7 312: Let's see, 312*56 = 17,472, and 17,576 -17,472=104. 104 is 312*(104/312)=1/3. So, 56 + 1/3 = 56.333...\n\nSo, 17,576 /312 = 56.333... which is 169/3. Because 169*3=507, 507*10=5070, 5070*3=15,210. Wait, no, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, 312 = 24*13. 17,576 \u00f7 24 = 732.333... Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nWait, 17,576 \u00f7 312:\n\n312 * 50 = 15,600\n\n17,576 -15,600=1,976\n\n312*6=1,872\n\n1,976-1,872=104\n\n312*0.333=104.\n\nSo, total is 50 +6 +0.333=56.333... which is 56 and 1/3, which is 169/3.\n\nWait, because 56.333... is 169/3. Since 56*3=168, plus 1 is 169.\n\nYes, so 17,576 /312 = 169/3.\n\nSo, 169/3 sin A sin B sin C = s.\n\nBut from earlier, we had r = 4R sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2).\n\nWhich is 6 = 4*13 sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2) \u2192 6 =52 sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2).\n\nSo, sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2) = 6/52 = 3/26.\n\nHmm, and I know that sin A sin B sin C can be expressed in terms of sin(A/2) etc.\n\nBut this might be getting too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula that relates sin A sin B sin C with other terms.\n\nWait, in a triangle, sin A sin B sin C = (a b c)/(8 R\u00b3).\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWe know that a = 2R sin A, b =2R sin B, c=2R sin C.\n\nSo, a b c = 8 R\u00b3 sin A sin B sin C.\n\nSo, sin A sin B sin C = (a b c)/(8 R\u00b3).\n\nBut we have a b c = 312 s.\n\nSo, sin A sin B sin C = (312 s)/(8 *13\u00b3).\n\nCalculating 13\u00b3: 13*13=169, 169*13=2197.\n\nSo, 8*2197=17,576.\n\nSo, sin A sin B sin C = (312 s)/17,576 = (312/17,576) s.\n\nSimplify 312/17,576: Let's see, both divided by 8: 39/2197.\n\nHmm, 2197 is 13\u00b3, so 2197=13*13*13.\n\n39 is 3*13. So, 39/2197= 3/(13\u00b2)=3/169.\n\nSo, sin A sin B sin C = (3/169) s.\n\nEarlier, we had 169/3 sin A sin B sin C = s.\n\nSo, substituting, 169/3 * (3/169) s = s \u2192 s = s.\n\nHmm, that's a tautology, so it doesn't give new information.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm going in circles here.\n\nWait, another idea: Let's consider the formula for the distance from the inradius to the vertex.\n\nWe have IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 = 6\u00b2 + (2\u221a30)^2 = 36 + 120 = 156, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, that doesn't give new info.\n\nWait, perhaps I can relate the sides using the fact that b + c = a + 4\u221a30.\n\nSo, b + c = a + 4\u221a30.\n\nBut we also know that a*b*c = 312 s, and s = a + 2\u221a30.\n\nSo, a*b*c = 312(a + 2\u221a30).\n\nBut we have three variables: a, b, c. And we also have b + c = a +4\u221a30.\n\nHmm, but we need another equation.\n\nWait, perhaps using the Law of Cosines.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, cos A = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2)/(2bc).\n\nBut I don't know angle A or the sides, so not sure.\n\nWait, but maybe we can find cos A in terms of other variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express b and c in terms of a.\n\nWait, since b + c = a +4\u221a30, let's denote b + c = a +4\u221a30.\n\nLet me denote S = b + c = a +4\u221a30.\n\nAlso, from the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nHmm, but without knowing cos A, this might not help.\n\nWait, but from the formula, we have tan(A/2) = \u221a30 /10.\n\nWe can find sin A and cos A from tan(A/2).\n\nBecause tan(A/2) = \u221a30 /10.\n\nSo, tan(A/2) = t = \u221a30 /10.\n\nThen, sin A = 2t/(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nt = \u221a30 /10.\n\nt\u00b2 = 30 /100 = 3/10.\n\nSo, sin A = 2*(\u221a30/10) / (1 + 3/10) = (2\u221a30 /10) / (13/10) = (2\u221a30 /10) * (10/13) )= 2\u221a30 /13.\n\nSimilarly, cos A = (1 - t\u00b2)/(1 + t\u00b2) = (1 - 3/10)/(1 +3/10) = (7/10)/(13/10) =7/13.\n\nSo, sin A = 2\u221a30 /13, cos A=7/13.\n\nSo, now, from the Law of Cosines:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nWhich is a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13).\n\nBut we can write this as a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nHmm, but we also have that b + c = a +4\u221a30.\n\nLet me square both sides of b + c = a +4\u221a30.\n\nSo, (b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + 8\u221a30 a + 16*30 = a\u00b2 +8\u221a30 a +480.\n\nBut (b + c)^2 = b\u00b2 + 2bc + c\u00b2.\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\nb\u00b2 + 2bc + c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 +8\u221a30 a +480.\n\nBut from the Law of Cosines, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nSo, substitute a\u00b2 into the equation:\n\nb\u00b2 + 2bc + c\u00b2 = [b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc] +8\u221a30 a +480.\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc +8\u221a30 a +480.\n\nSo, subtracting left side from both sides:\n\n0 = - (14/13) bc +8\u221a30 a +480 - 2bc.\n\nWait, let's bring everything to one side.\n\nWait, wait, let's subtract the right side from the left side:\n\n(b\u00b2 + 2bc + c\u00b2) - [b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc +8\u221a30 a +480] =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\nb\u00b2 +2bc +c\u00b2 -b\u00b2 -c\u00b2 + (14/13) bc -8\u221a30 a -480=0.\n\nSo, 2bc + (14/13) bc -8\u221a30 a -480=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(2 +14/13) bc -8\u221a30 a -480=0.\n\nConvert 2 to 26/13: 26/13 +14/13=40/13.\n\nSo, (40/13) bc -8\u221a30 a -480=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 13 to eliminate denominator:\n\n40 bc -104\u221a30 a -6240=0.\n\nSo, 40 bc =104\u221a30 a +6240.\n\nDivide both sides by 8 to simplify:\n\n5 bc =13\u221a30 a +780.\n\nSo, 5 bc =13\u221a30 a +780.\n\nHmm, so we have 5 bc =13\u221a30 a +780.\n\nBut from earlier, we have a*b*c =312 s, and s =a +2\u221a30.\n\nSo, a*b*c =312(a +2\u221a30).\n\nSo, bc = [312(a +2\u221a30)] /a.\n\nSo, bc = 312 (a +2\u221a30)/a.\n\nSo, substituting bc into the equation 5 bc =13\u221a30 a +780.\n\nSo, 5*(312 (a +2\u221a30)/a) )=13\u221a30 a +780.\n\nCompute 5*312=1560.\n\nSo, 1560 (a +2\u221a30)/a =13\u221a30 a +780.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n1560 (1 + 2\u221a30 /a ) =13\u221a30 a +780.\n\nDivide both sides by 13 to simplify:\n\n1560 /13 =120.\n\nSo, 120 (1 + 2\u221a30 /a ) = \u221a30 a +60.\n\nSo, 120 + 240\u221a30 /a = \u221a30 a +60.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n120 +240\u221a30 /a -\u221a30 a -60=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n60 +240\u221a30 /a -\u221a30 a=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by a to eliminate denominator:\n\n60a +240\u221a30 -\u221a30 a\u00b2=0.\n\nRearrange:\n\n-\u221a30 a\u00b2 +60a +240\u221a30=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n\u221a30 a\u00b2 -60a -240\u221a30=0.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of a:\n\n\u221a30 a\u00b2 -60a -240\u221a30=0.\n\nLet me divide all terms by \u221a30 to simplify:\n\na\u00b2 - (60 /\u221a30 ) a -240=0.\n\nSimplify 60/\u221a30: 60 /\u221a30 = (60\u221a30)/30 =2\u221a30.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2 -2\u221a30 a -240=0.\n\nSo, quadratic equation: a\u00b2 -2\u221a30 a -240=0.\n\nLet me solve for a using quadratic formula.\n\na = [2\u221a30 \u00b1 sqrt( (2\u221a30)^2 +4*240 ) ] /2.\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n(2\u221a30)^2 =4*30=120.\n\n4*240=960.\n\nSo, sqrt(120 +960)=sqrt(1080).\n\nSimplify sqrt(1080): sqrt(36*30)=6\u221a30.\n\nSo, a = [2\u221a30 \u00b16\u221a30 ] /2.\n\nSo, two possibilities:\n\na = [2\u221a30 +6\u221a30 ] /2 = (8\u221a30)/2=4\u221a30.\n\nOr a = [2\u221a30 -6\u221a30 ] /2 = (-4\u221a30)/2= -2\u221a30.\n\nBut a is a length, so it can't be negative. So, a=4\u221a30.\n\nSo, a=4\u221a30.\n\nNow, we can find s from earlier: s =a +2\u221a30=4\u221a30 +2\u221a30=6\u221a30.\n\nSo, s=6\u221a30.\n\nThen, a*b*c=312 s=312 *6\u221a30=1872\u221a30.\n\nBut we can also compute bc from earlier.\n\nFrom bc=312(a +2\u221a30)/a.\n\nSubstitute a=4\u221a30:\n\nbc=312*(4\u221a30 +2\u221a30)/4\u221a30=312*(6\u221a30)/4\u221a30.\n\nSimplify:\n\n312*(6\u221a30)/(4\u221a30)=312*6/4=312*(3/2)=468.\n\nSo, bc=468.\n\nTherefore, AB\u00b7AC =b*c=468.\n\nWait, so the answer is 468.\n\nLet me just check the steps quickly to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\n1. Calculated OI correctly as sqrt(13).\n2. Used IA perpendicular to OI to find IA=2\u221a39.\n3. Used IA\u00b2=r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2 to find s -a=2\u221a30.\n4. Expressed s in terms of a.\n5. Derived equations involving a, b, c, and solved using substitution and quadratic equation.\n6. Found a=4\u221a30, then s=6\u221a30.\n7. Calculated bc=468.\n\nSeems solid.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting the given information: triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) has circumradius \\( R = 13 \\), inradius \\( r = 6 \\), and \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\). We aim to find \\( AB \\cdot AC \\).\n\n1. **Distance between Incenter and Circumcenter**:\n   Using the formula \\( OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr \\), we calculate:\n   \\[\n   OI^2 = 13^2 - 2 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 6 = 169 - 156 = 13 \\implies OI = \\sqrt{13}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Length of \\( IA \\)**:\n   Since \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\), triangle \\( \\triangle IOA \\) is right-angled at \\( I \\). By the Pythagorean theorem:\n   \\[\n   IA^2 + OI^2 = OA^2 \\implies IA^2 + 13 = 169 \\implies IA^2 = 156 \\implies IA = 2\\sqrt{39}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Relating \\( IA \\) to Semiperimeter \\( s \\) and Side \\( a \\)**:\n   The formula \\( IA^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2 \\) gives:\n   \\[\n   156 = 6^2 + (s - a)^2 \\implies 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 \\implies (s - a)^2 = 120 \\implies s - a = 2\\sqrt{30}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Semiperimeter \\( s \\) in Terms of \\( a \\)**:\n   Since \\( s = \\frac{a + b + c}{2} \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   s - a = \\frac{-a + b + c}{2} = 2\\sqrt{30} \\implies b + c - a = 4\\sqrt{30}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Expressing \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) Using Sine Formula**:\n   Using \\( a = 2R \\sin A \\), \\( b = 2R \\sin B \\), \\( c = 2R \\sin C \\), and knowing \\( R = 13 \\), we express the sides in terms of angles.\n\n6. **Solving for \\( a \\)**:\n   Using the quadratic equation derived from the relationships between sides and semiperimeter, we find:\n   \\[\n   a = 4\\sqrt{30}.\n   \\]\n\n7. **Finding \\( s \\) and \\( bc \\)**:\n   Substituting \\( a = 4\\sqrt{30} \\) into \\( s = a + 2\\sqrt{30} \\), we get \\( s = 6\\sqrt{30} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nWe have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's break this down. I remember that the circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle, and the inradius r is also related to the area and semiperimeter. Since we have both R and r, maybe I can connect them somehow.\n\nFirst, let's recall some formulas:\n\n1. The circumradius R of triangle ABC is given by R = (a b c) / (4\u0394), where a, b, c are the sides, and \u0394 is the area.\n2. The inradius r is given by r = \u0394 / s, where s is the semiperimeter, s = (a + b + c) / 2.\n3. Also, the distance between the incenter I and circumcenter O can be found using the formula: OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that right? Let me think. Yes, I think that's correct. So OI squared equals R times (R minus twice the inradius).\n\nBut wait, in this problem, it's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. That must mean that the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. But maybe I can use coordinate geometry or vector methods here. Alternatively, maybe there's a geometric property or theorem that connects this perpendicularity condition with other elements of the triangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use coordinate geometry. Let me consider placing the triangle in a coordinate system to make things easier.\n\nLet me try to position the triangle such that point A is at (0, 0), and the line IA is along the y-axis. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, then OI must be horizontal, along the x-axis. Hmm, not sure if that's the best approach, but let me try.\n\nWait, another thought. Let's denote some variables. Let me denote the sides opposite to A, B, C as a, b, c respectively. So BC = a, AC = b, AB = c. Then, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nWe know R = 13, so from the formula R = (a b c)/(4\u0394), we can write \u0394 = (a b c)/(4R) = (a b c)/(52).\n\nAnd r = 6, so r = \u0394 / s => 6 = \u0394 / s => \u0394 = 6s.\n\nSo, setting these equal: (a b c)/(52) = 6s => a b c = 312 s.\n\nHmm, that's one equation. But we have three variables a, b, c, so more equations are needed.\n\nAlso, since OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r) = 13(13 - 12) = 13(1) = 13. So OI = sqrt(13).\n\nWait, OI is the distance between the incenter and circumradius. There's another formula: OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Let me check that. Oh, wait, the formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So plugging in the values:\n\nOI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is indeed sqrt(13), which matches what I had before.\n\nBut how does the fact that IA is perpendicular to OI come into play?\n\nHmm. Maybe I can use vectors. Let me denote the position vectors of points A, B, C, I, O with respect to some origin.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use coordinate geometry. Let's place the circumcenter O at the origin for simplicity. Then, since O is the circumcenter, all the vertices lie on a circle of radius 13 centered at O.\n\nThe incenter I has coordinates (x, y), and we know that OI has length sqrt(13), so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 13.\n\nNow, IA is perpendicular to OI. Vector IA would be from I to A. If O is at (0,0), and A is at some point (let's say A is at (a, b) on the circumcircle, so a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169.\n\nThen vector IA is (a - x, b - y). Vector OI is (x, y). The dot product of IA and OI should be zero because they are perpendicular. So:\n\n(a - x) * x + (b - y) * y = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\na x + b y - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 0\n\nBut since x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 13, this becomes:\n\na x + b y = 13\n\nHmm, okay. Also, since A lies on the circumcircle, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 169.\n\nHmm. Now, this might not be directly helpful yet, but perhaps I can find expressions for x and y in terms of the triangle's properties.\n\nWait, the inradius is 6, so r = 6. The inradius is the distance from I to any side, which is also the radius of the incircle. Also, the inradius is related to the area and semiperimeter: r = \u0394 / s, so \u0394 = 6s.\n\nWe also have the area \u0394 = (a b c)/(4R) = (a b c)/52. So, as I found before, a b c = 312 s.\n\nWait, but I don't know s yet. Hmm.\n\nAnother thought: maybe using trigonometric identities. Let me recall that in any triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the angles and sides.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for the length of IA. The length of IA can be given by IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Is that right? Wait, let me recall. The inradius is related to the exradius, but perhaps IA is the distance from the inradius to vertex A.\n\nWait, yes, I think the formula is IA = 2R sin(A/2), where R is the circumradius. Wait, no, that might be for the exradius. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, I think the formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A is IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Wait, let me confirm.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A can be expressed as IA = (r) / sin(A/2). I think that's correct. Let me see.\n\nYes, because in the inradius formulas, the inradius r is related to the angles. The formula IA = (r) / sin(A/2) makes sense, as it's derived from the properties of the inradius and the angle bisectors.\n\nSimilarly, IB = (r) / sin(B/2), IC = (r) / sin(C/2).\n\nSo, IA = 6 / sin(A/2). Since we know IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps we can find some relationship using that.\n\nWait, but IA is perpendicular to OI. Since O is the circumradius, which is at the origin, and I is somewhere inside the triangle.\n\nWait, maybe we can use coordinate geometry. Let me think again.\n\nLet me place the circumcenter O at the origin (0,0). Then, the coordinates of A, B, C lie on the circle of radius 13. Let me denote A as (13, 0) for simplicity, so it's on the x-axis. Then, the coordinates of A are (13, 0).\n\nWait, but then I is the incenter, which is at some point (x, y). The inradius is 6, so the distance from I to each side is 6.\n\nBut maybe it's better to place A at (13, 0), B at (13 cos \u03b8, 13 sin \u03b8), and C at (13 cos \u03c6, 13 sin \u03c6). Then, the incenter I has coordinates (x, y), which can be found using the formula for the incenter.\n\nWait, the incenter coordinates can be found as ( (a A_x + b B_x + c C_x ) / (a + b + c ), (a A_y + b B_y + c C_y ) / (a + b + c ) ), where a, b, c are the lengths of the sides opposite to A, B, C.\n\nBut since I'm setting A at (13, 0), B and C at other points on the circle, this might get complicated. Maybe another approach.\n\nWait, another idea: since IA is perpendicular to OI, and O is the circumradius, perhaps we can use vector dot product.\n\nLet me consider vectors. Let me denote vector IA as A - I, and vector OI as I - O, but O is at (0,0), so OI is just I. So, IA \u00b7 OI = 0.\n\nSo, (A - I) \u00b7 I = 0.\n\nWhich implies A \u00b7 I - |I|\u00b2 = 0.\n\nBut since A is on the circumcircle, |A| = R = 13. So, A \u00b7 I = |I|\u00b2.\n\nBut |I| is OI, which is sqrt(13). So, A \u00b7 I = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 = 13.\n\nSo, A \u00b7 I = 13.\n\nBut A is the point (13, 0) in my coordinate system. Wait, no, in my initial assumption, I placed A at (13, 0), so A = (13, 0). Then, vector A is (13, 0), and vector I is (x, y). So, their dot product is 13x + 0*y = 13x.\n\nSo, 13x = 13 => x = 1.\n\nSo, the x-coordinate of I is 1.\n\nThat's a useful piece of information.\n\nSo, I is at (1, y). And since OI = sqrt(13), the distance from O to I is sqrt(1\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(1 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(13). So,\n\nsqrt(1 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(13)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n1 + y\u00b2 = 13 => y\u00b2 = 12 => y = sqrt(12) or y = -sqrt(12). Since in a triangle, the inradius is inside, and depending on the orientation, but let's assume y is positive, so y = 2*sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the coordinates of I are (1, 2\u221a3).\n\nNow, I is the incenter, so its coordinates can also be expressed in terms of the sides a, b, c.\n\nWait, in my coordinate system, A is at (13, 0), B is at some point (13 cos \u03b8, 13 sin \u03b8), and C is at some other point (13 cos \u03c6, 13 sin \u03c6).\n\nThe incenter I has coordinates:\n\n( (a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x ) / (a + b + c ), (a*A_y + b*B_y + c*C_y ) / (a + b + c ) )\n\nBut in our case, A is (13, 0), B is (13 cos \u03b8, 13 sin \u03b8), C is (13 cos \u03c6, 13 sin \u03c6).\n\nSo, the x-coordinate of I is (a*13 + b*(13 cos \u03b8) + c*(13 cos \u03c6)) / (a + b + c ) = 1.\n\nSimilarly, the y-coordinate is (a*0 + b*(13 sin \u03b8) + c*(13 sin \u03c6)) / (a + b + c ) = 2\u221a3.\n\nSo, let me write these equations.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n[13a + 13b cos \u03b8 + 13c cos \u03c6] / (a + b + c ) = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by (a + b + c ):\n\n13a + 13b cos \u03b8 + 13c cos \u03c6 = a + b + c\n\nSimplify:\n\n13a - a + 13b cos \u03b8 - b + 13c cos \u03c6 - c = 0\n\nWhich is:\n\n12a + 12b cos \u03b8 + 12c cos \u03c6 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 12:\n\na + b cos \u03b8 + c cos \u03c6 = 0\n\nWait, that seems odd. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me go back.\n\nEquation 1:\n\n[13a + 13b cos \u03b8 + 13c cos \u03c6] = (a + b + c )\n\nWhich is:\n\n13a + 13b cos \u03b8 + 13c cos \u03c6 = a + b + c\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n13a - a + 13b cos \u03b8 - b + 13c cos \u03c6 - c = 0\n\nWhich is:\n\n12a + 12b cos \u03b8 + 12c cos \u03c6 = 0\n\nDivide by 12:\n\na + b cos \u03b8 + c cos \u03c6 = 0\n\nHmm, okay. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, the y-coordinate equation:\n\n[0*a + 13b sin \u03b8 + 13c sin \u03c6] = (2\u221a3)(a + b + c )\n\nSo:\n\n13b sin \u03b8 + 13c sin \u03c6 = 2\u221a3 (a + b + c )\n\nDivide both sides by 13:\n\nb sin \u03b8 + c sin \u03c6 = (2\u221a3 /13)(a + b + c )\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nNow, I also know that points B and C are on the circumcircle of radius 13, so their coordinates satisfy:\n\n(13 cos \u03b8)^2 + (13 sin \u03b8)^2 = 169, which is true for any \u03b8.\n\nSo, maybe I can find expressions for cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8, cos \u03c6, sin \u03c6 in terms of the triangle's sides.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, the sides can be expressed in terms of the angles. Using the law of sines, a = 2R sin A, but wait, no, actually, a = 2R sin A, but wait, no, the law of sines says a / sin A = 2R.\n\nSo, a = 2R sin A = 26 sin A, similarly b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSo, a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSo, we can express a, b, c in terms of the angles.\n\nBut then, the angles at A, B, C are related to the positions of points B and C on the circumcircle.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express cos \u03b8 and cos \u03c6 in terms of the triangle's angles.\n\nWait, in the coordinate system, point A is at (13, 0), and points B and C are at angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 from the positive x-axis. Then, the angle at A is angle BAC, which is the angle between vectors AB and AC.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's directly helpful. Maybe another approach.\n\nWait, from the law of sines, a = 26 sin A, etc. So, the sides are proportional to the sines of their opposite angles.\n\nAlso, in the coordinate system, the angle \u03b8 for point B is the angle from the x-axis to point B, and similarly for \u03c6.\n\nBut perhaps I can relate \u03b8 and \u03c6 to the angles of the triangle. Hmm, maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that in triangle ABC, the angles at B and C are related to the arcs between the points.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think about the angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 as the angles corresponding to points B and C in the circumcircle. Then, the central angles for arcs BC, AC, and AB would be 2A, 2B, 2C respectively.\n\nWait, in a circle, the central angle corresponding to an arc is twice the inscribed angle. So, the central angle for arc BC is 2A, for arc AC is 2B, and for arc AB is 2C.\n\nSo, the angle \u03b8 for point B is the angle from the x-axis to point B. Since point A is at (13, 0), the central angle from A to B is 2C, because in the circumcircle, the central angle over arc AB is 2C, where C is the angle at point C in triangle ABC.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me think: in the circumcircle, the central angle subtended by side BC is 2A. Because in the triangle, angle at A is opposite side BC, so the inscribed angle is A, and the central angle is 2A.\n\nSimilarly, the central angle subtended by side AC is 2B, and the central angle subtended by side AB is 2C.\n\nSo, in our coordinate system, point A is at (13, 0). The central angle from A to B is 2C, and from A to C is 2B, assuming the triangle is labeled in order.\n\nWait, but I think it's the other way around. The central angle over BC is 2A, so the angle between points B and C as viewed from the center is 2A. Similarly, the angle between A and B is 2C, and between A and C is 2B.\n\nWait, I think that's correct. So, if I have point A at (13, 0), then point B is at an angle of 2C from the positive x-axis, and point C is at an angle of -2B, assuming the triangle is oriented counterclockwise.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let me assume that the triangle is oriented so that point B is at an angle of 2C above the x-axis, and point C is at an angle of 2B below the x-axis, so that the central angles add up to 2A between B and C.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me denote the angles at the center corresponding to arcs BC, AC, and AB as 2A, 2B, and 2C respectively.\n\nSo, the central angle for arc BC is 2A, which is the angle between points B and C as seen from the center O. Similarly, the central angle for arc AC is 2B, and for arc AB is 2C.\n\nSince the total central angles around O add up to 360 degrees, we have 2A + 2B + 2C = 360\u00b0, which is consistent with A + B + C = 180\u00b0 in the triangle.\n\nSo, in our coordinate system, point A is at (13, 0). Let me place point B at an angle of \u03b8 from the x-axis, and point C at an angle of -\u03c6, so that the central angles between A and B is \u03b8, between A and C is \u03c6, and the central angle between B and C is 2A.\n\nWait, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps I can set point B at angle 2C from the x-axis, and point C at angle -2B, so that the central angle between B and C is 2C + 2B, which would be 2(A + B + C) but that's 360\u00b0, which is not correct. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assign point B at angle 2C, and point C at angle -2B, so that the central angle between B and C is 2C + 2B, which equals 2(A + B + C - A) = 2(180 - A) + something... Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, maybe I should proceed with the expressions I have.\n\nSo, from earlier, I have:\n\na + b cos \u03b8 + c cos \u03c6 = 0  ...(1)\n\nand\n\nb sin \u03b8 + c sin \u03c6 = (2\u221a3 /13)(a + b + c )  ...(2)\n\nAlso, a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nHmm, and from the triangle, A + B + C = \u03c0.\n\nBut perhaps I can express \u03b8 and \u03c6 in terms of the angles of the triangle.\n\nWait, since point A is at (13, 0), point B is at (13 cos \u03b8, 13 sin \u03b8), and point C is at (13 cos \u03c6, 13 sin \u03c6).\n\nThe angle at A is angle BAC, which is the angle between vectors AB and AC. But perhaps it's better to relate the central angles to the triangle's angles.\n\nWait, the central angle over arc BC is 2A, so the angle between points B and C as seen from O is 2A. So, the angle between vectors OB and OC is 2A.\n\nSimilarly, the central angle over arc AC is 2B, and over arc AB is 2C.\n\nSo, if I place point A at (13, 0), then point B is at an angle of \u03b1, and point C is at an angle of \u03b2, such that the angle between OB and OC is 2A, so \u03b2 - \u03b1 = 2A.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right way. Maybe I can assign \u03b8 as the angle for point B and \u03c6 as the angle for point C, so that \u03c6 - \u03b8 = 2A.\n\nWait, maybe. So, if point B is at angle \u03b8, then point C is at angle \u03b8 + 2A.\n\nWait, that could make sense, because the central angle between B and C is 2A.\n\nSo, let me assume that point B is at angle \u03b8, and point C is at angle \u03b8 + 2A.\n\nThen, their coordinates are:\n\nB: (13 cos \u03b8, 13 sin \u03b8)\n\nC: (13 cos (\u03b8 + 2A), 13 sin (\u03b8 + 2A))\n\nHmm, okay. Then, the angle at A is A, which is the angle between vectors AB and AC.\n\nWait, vector AB is from A to B: (13 cos \u03b8 - 13, 13 sin \u03b8 - 0) = (13 (cos \u03b8 - 1), 13 sin \u03b8)\n\nSimilarly, vector AC is from A to C: (13 cos (\u03b8 + 2A) - 13, 13 sin (\u03b8 + 2A) - 0) = (13 (cos (\u03b8 + 2A) - 1), 13 sin (\u03b8 + 2A))\n\nThe angle between vectors AB and AC is A. So, the dot product of AB and AC is |AB| |AC| cos A.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the law of cosines in the triangle to find relations between the sides.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can use the fact that the inradius is 6 and the semiperimeter is s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nWe also have that area \u0394 = 6s = (a b c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a b c)/52 => a b c = 312 s.\n\nHmm, but without knowing s, this might not be directly helpful yet.\n\nWait, maybe I can find s in terms of the sides. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula that relates the inradius, semiperimeter, and the distance from the incenter to the circumradius.\n\nWait, another idea: in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumradius is given by OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r), which we have as 13.\n\nBut we also have that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, perhaps using Pythagoras' theorem in triangle OIA.\n\nWait, in triangle OIA, since IA is perpendicular to OI, then OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nBut OA is the circumradius, which is 13. OI is sqrt(13). IA is the distance from I to A, which we had as IA = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nSo, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 => 13\u00b2 = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 + (IA)\u00b2 => 169 = 13 + IA\u00b2 => IA\u00b2 = 156 => IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nBut earlier, I thought IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2). So, 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39) => sin(A/2) = 6 / (2\u221a39) = 3 / \u221a39 = \u221a39 / 13.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3 / \u221a39 can be rationalized as 3\u221a39 / 39 = \u221a39 / 13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = \u221a39 / 13.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, from this, we can find cos(A/2) using Pythagorean identity: cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2(A/2)) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nNow, from trigonometric identities, we have:\n\nsin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(\u221a39/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = 2*(\u221a(39*130))/169.\n\nWait, 39 * 130 = 39*13*10 = 507*10 = 5070. Hmm, sqrt(5070) can be simplified.\n\nWait, 5070 = 10 * 507 = 10 * 3 * 169 = 10 * 3 * 13\u00b2. So, sqrt(5070) = 13 * sqrt(30).\n\nWait, because sqrt(10 * 3 * 13\u00b2) = 13 * sqrt(30).\n\nSo, sin A = 2*(13*sqrt(30))/169 = (26 sqrt(30)) / 169 = (2 sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSince a = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 2*2 sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\na = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = (26)*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = (26/13)*2 sqrt(30) = 2*2 sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nYes, that's correct. So, side a (BC) is 4 sqrt(30).\n\nNow, that's a good start. Now, perhaps we can find the other sides.\n\nWait, but we need AB \u00b7 AC, which are sides c and b respectively.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find expressions for b and c in terms of the angles.\n\nWait, using the law of sines: a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C = 2R = 26.\n\nSo, a = 4 sqrt(30) = 26 sin A, which matches because sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13, so 26*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 4 sqrt(30), correct.\n\nSimilarly, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSo, if we can find angles B and C, we can find b and c.\n\nWe know that A + B + C = \u03c0, so B + C = \u03c0 - A.\n\nHmm, and we can perhaps find expressions involving B and C using the earlier equations.\n\nWait, from the first equation we had in the coordinate system:\n\na + b cos \u03b8 + c cos \u03c6 = 0.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful anymore. Alternatively, perhaps using the second equation.\n\nWait, another thought: from the area, since \u0394 = 6s, and also \u0394 = (a b c)/(4R) = (a b c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a b c)/52 => a b c = 312 s.\n\nBut a = 4 sqrt(30), so:\n\n4 sqrt(30) * b * c = 312 s.\n\nHmm, but s = (a + b + c)/2, so we can write:\n\n4 sqrt(30) * b * c = 312 * (a + b + c)/2 = 156 (a + b + c).\n\nBut this seems a bit involved, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the inradius in terms of the sides.\n\nr = \u0394 / s => 6 = \u0394 / s => \u0394 = 6s.\n\nAlso, from Heron's formula, \u0394 = sqrt[s (s - a) (s - b) (s - c)].\n\nBut perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, let me think about the formula for the area in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter: \u0394 = r s = 6s.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed as (1/2)ab sin C, etc. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.\n\nWait, another idea: since we know a, maybe we can find expressions for b and c using the fact that a + b + c = 2s.\n\nWait, but I don't know s yet. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me try to find cos A.\n\nWe have sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13, so cos A = sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2 A) = sqrt(1 - (4*30)/169) = sqrt(1 - 120/169) = sqrt(49/169) = 7/13.\n\nSo, cos A = 7/13.\n\nNow, using the law of cosines: a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nWe have a = 4 sqrt(30), so a\u00b2 = 16 * 30 = 480.\n\nSo, 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13).\n\nHmm, that's one equation involving b and c.\n\nWe also know from the law of sines that b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSince A + B + C = \u03c0, and we have angle A known, perhaps we can find B and C in terms of each other.\n\nWait, but I don't know angle A's measure, only that sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13 and cos A = 7/13.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can express sin B and sin C in terms of angle A.\n\nWait, another idea: using the formula for the area \u0394 = (1/2) b c sin A.\n\nBut \u0394 = 6s, and s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, 6s = (1/2) b c sin A => 12s = b c sin A.\n\nBut from earlier, a b c = 312 s => (4 sqrt(30)) b c = 312 s => b c = (312 s) / (4 sqrt(30)) ) = (78 s) / sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, but from \u0394 = 6s, and \u0394 = (1/2) b c sin A, so:\n\n6s = (1/2) b c sin A => 12s = b c sin A.\n\nBut we have b c = (78 s) / sqrt(30), so:\n\n12 s = (78 s / sqrt(30)) * sin A.\n\nDivide both sides by s (assuming s \u2260 0):\n\n12 = (78 / sqrt(30)) * sin A.\n\nBut sin A is 2 sqrt(30)/13, so:\n\n12 = (78 / sqrt(30)) * (2 sqrt(30)/13).\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n78 / sqrt(30) * 2 sqrt(30)/13 = (78 * 2) / 13 = (156)/13 = 12.\n\nSo, 12 = 12, which is consistent. Hmm, so that doesn't give me new information.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nWait, from the earlier equations, perhaps I can find expressions for cos \u03b8 and cos \u03c6.\n\nWait, in the coordinate system, point I is at (1, 2\u221a3). The inradius is 6, so the distance from I to each side is 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula for the inradius in terms of the coordinates. Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula that relates the inradius, the sides, and the distances from the incenter to the vertices.\n\nWait, another thought: since I is the incenter, the distances from I to the sides are equal to the inradius, which is 6.\n\nIn our coordinate system, the sides BC, AC, and AB are lines. The distance from I to each of these lines is 6.\n\nPerhaps I can find the equations of these lines and set their distance from I to 6.\n\nLet me attempt that.\n\nFirst, find the equation of side BC. Points B and C are at (13 cos \u03b8, 13 sin \u03b8) and (13 cos \u03c6, 13 sin \u03c6). The equation of line BC can be found using the two-point form.\n\nBut maybe it's better to find the general equation for line BC.\n\nThe general equation of a line through two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is (y - y1)(x2 - x1) = (y2 - y1)(x - x1).\n\nSo, the equation of BC is (y - 13 sin \u03b8)(13 cos \u03c6 - 13 cos \u03b8) = (13 sin \u03c6 - 13 sin \u03b8)(x - 13 cos \u03b8).\n\nSimplify this:\n\n(y - 13 sin \u03b8)(cos \u03c6 - cos \u03b8) = (sin \u03c6 - sin \u03b8)(x - 13 cos \u03b8)\n\nDivide both sides by 13:\n\n(y - sin \u03b8)(cos \u03c6 - cos \u03b8) = ( (sin \u03c6 - sin \u03b8)/13 )(x - cos \u03b8 )\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line.\n\nThe distance from I (1, 2\u221a3) to line BC is 6.\n\nThe formula for the distance from point (x0, y0) to line ax + by + c = 0 is |a x0 + b y0 + c| / sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2).\n\nSo, I need the equation of line BC in the form ax + by + c = 0.\n\nLet me find the equation of line BC.\n\nPoints B and C are at (13 cos \u03b8, 13 sin \u03b8) and (13 cos \u03c6, 13 sin \u03c6). The slope of BC is (13 sin \u03c6 - 13 sin \u03b8)/(13 cos \u03c6 - 13 cos \u03b8) = (sin \u03c6 - sin \u03b8)/(cos \u03c6 - cos \u03b8).\n\nUsing the identity, sin \u03c6 - sin \u03b8 = 2 cos( (\u03c6 + \u03b8)/2 ) sin( (\u03c6 - \u03b8)/2 )\n\nAnd cos \u03c6 - cos \u03b8 = -2 sin( (\u03c6 + \u03b8)/2 ) sin( (\u03c6 - \u03b8)/2 )\n\nSo, the slope m is [2 cos( (\u03c6 + \u03b8)/2 ) sin( (\u03c6 - \u03b8)/2 ) ] / [ -2 sin( (\u03c6 + \u03b8)/2 ) sin( (\u03c6 - \u03b8)/2 ) ] = - cot( (\u03c6 + \u03b8)/2 )\n\nSo, the slope m = -cot( (\u03c6 + \u03b8)/2 )\n\nSo, the equation of line BC can be written as y - 13 sin \u03b8 = m (x - 13 cos \u03b8 )\n\nSo, y = m x - m *13 cos \u03b8 + 13 sin \u03b8.\n\nNow, write this in standard form: m x - y - (m *13 cos \u03b8 - 13 sin \u03b8) = 0.\n\nSo, the equation is m x - y + c = 0, where c = - (m *13 cos \u03b8 - 13 sin \u03b8 )\n\nNow, the distance from I (1, 2\u221a3) to this line is |m*1 - 1*(2\u221a3) + c| / sqrt(m\u00b2 + 1) ) = 6.\n\nSo,\n\n|m - 2\u221a3 + c| / sqrt(m\u00b2 + 1) = 6.\n\nBut c = - (m *13 cos \u03b8 - 13 sin \u03b8 )\n\nSo,\n\n|m - 2\u221a3 - m *13 cos \u03b8 + 13 sin \u03b8 | / sqrt(m\u00b2 + 1) ) = 6.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I can find a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps using the fact that the inradius is the distance from I to each side, which is 6. So, the distance from I to BC is 6, and similarly for AB and AC.\n\nWait, but in our coordinate system, point A is at (13, 0), I is at (1, 2\u221a3). The distance from I to side AB is 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find the equation of side AB and compute its distance from I.\n\nWait, side AB is from A (13, 0) to B (13 cos \u03b8, 13 sin \u03b8). The slope of AB is (13 sin \u03b8 - 0)/(13 cos \u03b8 - 13) = (sin \u03b8)/(cos \u03b8 - 1).\n\nThe equation of AB can be written as y = [sin \u03b8 / (cos \u03b8 - 1)] (x - 13).\n\nLet me write this in standard form: [sin \u03b8] (x - 13) - [cos \u03b8 - 1] y = 0.\n\nSo, sin \u03b8 x - 13 sin \u03b8 - (cos \u03b8 - 1) y = 0.\n\nSo, the distance from I (1, 2\u221a3) to this line is |sin \u03b8 *1 - 13 sin \u03b8 - (cos \u03b8 - 1)*2\u221a3| / sqrt( sin\u00b2 \u03b8 + (cos \u03b8 - 1)^2 ) ) = 6.\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\n| sin \u03b8 -13 sin \u03b8 - (cos \u03b8 - 1)*2\u221a3 | = | -12 sin \u03b8 - 2\u221a3 (cos \u03b8 - 1) |.\n\nWhich is | -12 sin \u03b8 - 2\u221a3 cos \u03b8 + 2\u221a3 |.\n\nThe denominator is sqrt( sin\u00b2 \u03b8 + (cos \u03b8 - 1)^2 ).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nsin\u00b2 \u03b8 + (cos \u03b8 - 1)^2 = sin\u00b2 \u03b8 + cos\u00b2 \u03b8 - 2 cos \u03b8 + 1 = (sin\u00b2 \u03b8 + cos\u00b2 \u03b8) + (-2 cos \u03b8 + 1) = 1 + (-2 cos \u03b8 + 1) = 2 - 2 cos \u03b8 = 2(1 - cos \u03b8).\n\nSo, denominator = sqrt(2(1 - cos \u03b8)).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n| -12 sin \u03b8 - 2\u221a3 cos \u03b8 + 2\u221a3 | / sqrt(2(1 - cos \u03b8)) ) = 6.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can simplify.\n\nLet me denote t = \u03b8. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n| -12 sin t - 2\u221a3 cos t + 2\u221a3 | = 6 * sqrt(2(1 - cos t)).\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the absolute value and the square root:\n\n( -12 sin t - 2\u221a3 cos t + 2\u221a3 )\u00b2 = 36 * 2 (1 - cos t )\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n= [ -12 sin t - 2\u221a3 cos t + 2\u221a3 ]\u00b2\n\n= ( -12 sin t )\u00b2 + ( -2\u221a3 cos t )\u00b2 + (2\u221a3 )\u00b2 + 2*(-12 sin t)*(-2\u221a3 cos t) + 2*(-12 sin t)*(2\u221a3 ) + 2*(-2\u221a3 cos t)*(2\u221a3 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(-12 sin t)^2 = 144 sin\u00b2 t\n\n(-2\u221a3 cos t)^2 = 4*3 cos\u00b2 t = 12 cos\u00b2 t\n\n(2\u221a3)^2 = 4*3 = 12\n\nCross terms:\n\n2*(-12 sin t)*(-2\u221a3 cos t) = 2*(24\u221a3 sin t cos t) = 48\u221a3 sin t cos t\n\n2*(-12 sin t)*(2\u221a3 ) = 2*(-24\u221a3 sin t ) = -48\u221a3 sin t\n\n2*(-2\u221a3 cos t)*(2\u221a3 ) = 2*(-4*3 cos t ) = 2*(-12 cos t ) = -24 cos t\n\nSo, adding all together:\n\n144 sin\u00b2 t + 12 cos\u00b2 t + 12 + 48\u221a3 sin t cos t - 48\u221a3 sin t -24 cos t.\n\nSo, left side becomes:\n\n144 sin\u00b2 t + 12 cos\u00b2 t + 12 + 48\u221a3 sin t cos t - 48\u221a3 sin t -24 cos t.\n\nThe right side is 72(1 - cos t) = 72 - 72 cos t.\n\nNow, moving everything to left:\n\n144 sin\u00b2 t + 12 cos\u00b2 t + 12 + 48\u221a3 sin t cos t - 48\u221a3 sin t -24 cos t -72 + 72 cos t = 0.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n144 sin\u00b2 t + 12 cos\u00b2 t + (12 -72) + 48\u221a3 sin t cos t -48\u221a3 sin t + (-24 cos t +72 cos t) = 0.\n\nWhich is:\n\n144 sin\u00b2 t + 12 cos\u00b2 t -60 + 48\u221a3 sin t cos t -48\u221a3 sin t +48 cos t = 0.\n\nHmm, this is getting quite involved. Maybe I can factor some terms.\n\nLet me note that 144 sin\u00b2 t + 12 cos\u00b2 t = 12 (12 sin\u00b2 t + cos\u00b2 t).\n\nHmm, perhaps not helpful. Alternatively, let's factor 12:\n\n12(12 sin\u00b2 t + cos\u00b2 t) -60 + 48\u221a3 sin t cos t -48\u221a3 sin t +48 cos t = 0.\n\nHmm, 12 sin\u00b2 t + cos\u00b2 t = 11 sin\u00b2 t + (sin\u00b2 t + cos\u00b2 t) = 11 sin\u00b2 t + 1.\n\nSo, 12(11 sin\u00b2 t + 1) -60 + 48\u221a3 sin t cos t -48\u221a3 sin t +48 cos t = 0.\n\nWhich is:\n\n132 sin\u00b2 t + 12 -60 + 48\u221a3 sin t cos t -48\u221a3 sin t +48 cos t = 0.\n\nSimplify constants: 12 -60 = -48.\n\nSo,\n\n132 sin\u00b2 t -48 + 48\u221a3 sin t cos t -48\u221a3 sin t +48 cos t = 0.\n\nDivide all terms by 12 to simplify:\n\n11 sin\u00b2 t -4 + 4\u221a3 sin t cos t -4\u221a3 sin t +4 cos t = 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor terms:\n\nLet me group terms:\n\n11 sin\u00b2 t +4\u221a3 sin t cos t -4\u221a3 sin t +4 cos t -4 = 0.\n\nThis is quite complex. Maybe I can express everything in terms of sin t and cos t, and see if I can factor it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use substitution. Let me set u = sin t, v = cos t, with u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = 1.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n11 u\u00b2 +4\u221a3 u v -4\u221a3 u +4 v -4 = 0.\n\nBut this is still a quadratic in u and v, which might not be easy to solve.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor this equation.\n\nLooking at 11 u\u00b2 +4\u221a3 u v -4\u221a3 u +4 v -4 = 0.\n\nLet me try to group terms:\n\n(11 u\u00b2) + (4\u221a3 u v -4\u221a3 u) + (4 v -4) = 0.\n\nFactor terms:\n\n11 u\u00b2 + 4\u221a3 u (v - 1) +4(v -1) = 0.\n\nHmm, so:\n\n11 u\u00b2 + (4\u221a3 u +4)(v -1) = 0.\n\nBut since v = cos t, and u = sin t, perhaps we can express this in terms of u and v.\n\nHmm, not sure. Maybe I can write this as:\n\n11 u\u00b2 + (4\u221a3 u +4)(v -1) = 0.\n\nBut since u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 =1, perhaps I can express v in terms of u or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write v = (something) in terms of u.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor further.\n\nWait, 11 u\u00b2 +4\u221a3 u (v -1) +4(v -1) = 0.\n\nLet me factor (v -1):\n\n= 11 u\u00b2 + (4\u221a3 u +4)(v -1) = 0.\n\nHmm, maybe I can write this as:\n\n11 u\u00b2 = -(4\u221a3 u +4)(v -1).\n\nBut since v = sqrt(1 - u\u00b2), assuming cos t is positive, which it might not be, but let's proceed.\n\nSo, 11 u\u00b2 = -(4\u221a3 u +4)(sqrt(1 - u\u00b2) -1).\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square root.\n\nWait, but before that, perhaps it's better to consider specific angles or see if there's a substitution that can simplify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this approach is too time-consuming, and I should look for a different method.\n\nWait, going back to the problem, I know that a = 4 sqrt(30), and I need to find AB \u00b7 AC, which are sides c and b respectively.\n\nWait, AB is the length from A to B, which is sqrt[ (13 cos \u03b8 -13)^2 + (13 sin \u03b8)^2 ].\n\nSimplify:\n\n= sqrt[ 169 (cos \u03b8 -1)^2 + 169 sin\u00b2 \u03b8 ]\n\n= 13 sqrt[ (cos \u03b8 -1)^2 + sin\u00b2 \u03b8 ]\n\n= 13 sqrt[ cos\u00b2 \u03b8 - 2 cos \u03b8 +1 + sin\u00b2 \u03b8 ]\n\n= 13 sqrt[ (cos\u00b2 \u03b8 + sin\u00b2 \u03b8) - 2 cos \u03b8 +1 ]\n\n= 13 sqrt[ 1 - 2 cos \u03b8 +1 ]\n\n= 13 sqrt[ 2 - 2 cos \u03b8 ]\n\n= 13 sqrt[ 2(1 - cos \u03b8) ]\n\n= 13 * 2 sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nBecause sqrt(2(1 - cos \u03b8)) = 2 sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo, AB = 26 sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSimilarly, AC can be found as 26 sin(\u03c6/2), where \u03c6 is the angle for point C.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the central angle between B and C is 2A, so \u03c6 - \u03b8 = 2A.\n\nHmm, so \u03c6 = \u03b8 + 2A.\n\nSo, AC = 26 sin( (\u03b8 + 2A)/2 ) = 26 sin( \u03b8/2 + A ).\n\nSo, AB \u00b7 AC = [26 sin(\u03b8/2)] * [26 sin(\u03b8/2 + A)] = 676 sin(\u03b8/2) sin(\u03b8/2 + A).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find \u03b8 in terms of A.\n\nWait, from earlier, we have point I at (1, 2\u221a3), which is the incenter. The inradius is 6, so the distance from I to each side is 6.\n\nIn particular, the distance from I to AB is 6, which we tried to use earlier but got stuck.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use trigonometric identities to find \u03b8.\n\nWait, from the earlier equation, after simplifying, I have:\n\n11 sin\u00b2 t -4 + 4\u221a3 sin t cos t -4\u221a3 sin t +4 cos t = 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write this in terms of sin(2t), cos(2t), etc.\n\nLet me use double-angle identities.\n\nWe know that sin(2t) = 2 sin t cos t, cos(2t) = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2 t, etc.\n\nLet me rewrite the equation:\n\n11 sin\u00b2 t +4\u221a3 sin t cos t -4\u221a3 sin t +4 cos t -4 = 0.\n\nExpress sin\u00b2 t as (1 - cos 2t)/2, and sin t cos t as (sin 2t)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n11*(1 - cos 2t)/2 +4\u221a3*(sin 2t)/2 -4\u221a3 sin t +4 cos t -4 = 0.\n\nMultiply through:\n\n(11/2)(1 - cos 2t) + 2\u221a3 sin 2t -4\u221a3 sin t +4 cos t -4 = 0.\n\nExpanding:\n\n11/2 - (11/2) cos 2t + 2\u221a3 sin 2t -4\u221a3 sin t +4 cos t -4 = 0.\n\nCombine constants: 11/2 -4 = (11 -8)/2 = 3/2.\n\nSo,\n\n3/2 - (11/2) cos 2t + 2\u221a3 sin 2t -4\u221a3 sin t +4 cos t = 0.\n\nHmm, this still looks complicated. Maybe I can rearrange terms.\n\nGroup the terms with cos 2t and sin 2t:\n\n- (11/2) cos 2t + 2\u221a3 sin 2t +4 cos t -4\u221a3 sin t +3/2 = 0.\n\nThis is getting too involved. Perhaps it's better to try to find \u03b8 numerically, but that's not helpful for an exact answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I can make an assumption to simplify. Let me assume that angle \u03b8 is such that the equation simplifies nicely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find another relation involving \u03b8.\n\nWait, from the earlier equation in the coordinate system, equation (1):\n\na + b cos \u03b8 + c cos \u03c6 = 0.\n\nBut a =4 sqrt(30), and \u03c6 = \u03b8 + 2A.\n\nSo, equation (1) becomes:\n\n4 sqrt(30) + b cos \u03b8 + c cos(\u03b8 + 2A) = 0.\n\nHmm, but without knowing b, c, or \u03b8, this might not help.\n\nWait, but from the law of sines, b = 26 sin B, c =26 sin C.\n\nAnd since B + C = \u03c0 - A, and from earlier, we have angle A known, perhaps we can express B and C in terms of a single variable.\n\nWait, let me denote angle B as \u03b1, then angle C = \u03c0 - A - \u03b1.\n\nSo, b = 26 sin \u03b1, c =26 sin(\u03c0 - A - \u03b1) =26 sin(A + \u03b1).\n\nSo, equation (1):\n\n4 sqrt(30) + 26 sin \u03b1 cos \u03b8 + 26 sin(A + \u03b1) cos(\u03b8 + 2A) = 0.\n\nHmm, but without knowing \u03b8, this is still difficult.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps using the fact that in triangle ABC, the inradius is 6, and the semiperimeter is s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nWe also have that the area \u0394 = 6s = (a b c)/(4R) = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/52.\n\nSo,\n\n6s = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/52.\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2, so:\n\n6*(a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/52.\n\nSimplify:\n\n3(a + b + c) = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/52.\n\nMultiply both sides by 52:\n\n156(a + b + c) = 4 sqrt(30) * b * c.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n39(a + b + c) = sqrt(30) * b * c.\n\nHmm, but from earlier, a =4 sqrt(30), so:\n\n39(4 sqrt(30) + b + c) = sqrt(30) * b * c.\n\nHmm, maybe we can express b + c in terms of s.\n\nWait, s = (a + b + c)/2, so b + c = 2s - a.\n\nBut I don't know s yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find expressions for b and c using the law of sines and the fact that a =4 sqrt(30).\n\nWait, from the law of sines, a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C =26.\n\nSo, b =26 sin B, c =26 sin C.\n\nSince B + C = \u03c0 - A, and we have sin B and sin C in terms of angle B.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can use the formula for the product of sides:\n\nb c = (26 sin B)(26 sin C) = 676 sin B sin C.\n\nAnd since C = \u03c0 - A - B,\n\nsin C = sin(\u03c0 - A - B) = sin(A + B).\n\nSo, b c = 676 sin B sin(A + B).\n\nHmm, perhaps using product-to-sum formulas.\n\nsin B sin(A + B) = [cos(A) - cos(2B + A)] / 2.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the product bc in terms of a and angles.\n\nWait, from the law of cosines, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nWe have a =4 sqrt(30), so 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13).\n\nHmm, and from earlier, bc = (312 s)/a = (312 s)/(4 sqrt(30)).\n\nBut without knowing s, this is still not helpful.\n\nWait, another approach: using the formula for the area in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter, and also in terms of the sides.\n\nWe have \u0394 = 6s = (1/2)ab sin C, etc.\n\nBut perhaps using \u0394 = 6s and \u0394 = (a b c)/(4R) = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/52.\n\nSo,\n\n6s = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/52.\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2, so:\n\n6*(a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/52.\n\nSimplify:\n\n3(a + b + c) = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/52.\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n3(a + b + c) = (sqrt(30)/13) * b * c.\n\nSo,\n\n3(a + b + c) = (sqrt(30)/13) * b * c.\n\nHmm, but without more information, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula for the area in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter, and also in terms of the sides.\n\nWait, another idea: from the formula for the distance from the incenter to the vertex.\n\nWe have IA = sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2), where s is the semiperimeter.\n\nWait, let me check this formula.\n\nYes, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = sqrt[r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2].\n\nWe have IA = sqrt(6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2) = sqrt(36 + (s - a)^2).\n\nBut earlier, we found IA = 2 sqrt(39), so:\n\nsqrt(36 + (s - a)^2) = 2 sqrt(39).\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n36 + (s - a)^2 = 4*39 = 156.\n\nSo,\n\n(s - a)^2 = 156 - 36 = 120.\n\nThus,\n\ns - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nSince s is the semiperimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2, so:\n\ns - a = (a + b + c)/2 - a = (-a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n(-a + b + c)/2 = 2 sqrt(30).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n-a + b + c = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nBut a =4 sqrt(30), so:\n\n-4 sqrt(30) + b + c =4 sqrt(30).\n\nThus,\n\nb + c = 8 sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, that's a useful equation.\n\nSo, b + c =8 sqrt(30).\n\nWe also have from the law of sines, b =26 sin B, c=26 sin C.\n\nAnd since B + C = \u03c0 - A, we can express C = \u03c0 - A - B.\n\nSo, c =26 sin(\u03c0 - A - B) =26 sin(A + B).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can use the sum formula for sine.\n\nsin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B.\n\nSo, c =26 [ sin A cos B + cos A sin B ].\n\nBut sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13, cos A =7/13.\n\nSo,\n\nc =26 [ (2 sqrt(30)/13) cos B + (7/13) sin B ]\n\n=26*(2 sqrt(30) cos B +7 sin B)/13\n\n=2*(2 sqrt(30) cos B +7 sin B )\n\n=4 sqrt(30) cos B +14 sin B.\n\nSimilarly, b =26 sin B.\n\nSo, from b + c =8 sqrt(30):\n\n26 sin B +4 sqrt(30) cos B +14 sin B =8 sqrt(30).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(26 sin B +14 sin B) +4 sqrt(30) cos B =8 sqrt(30).\n\nWhich is:\n\n40 sin B +4 sqrt(30) cos B =8 sqrt(30).\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n10 sin B + sqrt(30) cos B =2 sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, this is a linear combination of sin B and cos B. Let me write this as:\n\n10 sin B + sqrt(30) cos B =2 sqrt(30).\n\nI can express this as R sin(B + \u03c6) =2 sqrt(30), where R is the amplitude and \u03c6 is the phase shift.\n\nCompute R:\n\nR = sqrt(10\u00b2 + (sqrt(30))\u00b2 )= sqrt(100 +30)=sqrt(130).\n\nSo, 10 sin B + sqrt(30) cos B = sqrt(130) sin(B + \u03c6) =2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(130) sin(B + \u03c6) =2 sqrt(30).\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(130):\n\nsin(B + \u03c6) = (2 sqrt(30))/sqrt(130) = (2 sqrt(30))/sqrt(130).\n\nSimplify sqrt(30)/sqrt(130) = sqrt(30/130) = sqrt(3/13).\n\nSo,\n\nsin(B + \u03c6) = 2*sqrt(3/13) = 2 sqrt(39)/13.\n\nWait, because sqrt(3/13) is sqrt(39)/13? Wait, no:\n\nWait, sqrt(3/13) = sqrt(39)/13, because sqrt(3/13) = sqrt(3*13)/(13) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo, sin(B + \u03c6) =2*sqrt(39)/13.\n\nHmm, but the maximum value of sine is 1, so 2*sqrt(39)/13 must be less than or equal to 1.\n\nCompute 2*sqrt(39) \u22482*6.245\u224812.49, 12.49/13\u22480.96. So, yes, it's less than 1.\n\nSo, B + \u03c6 = arcsin(2 sqrt(39)/13).\n\nBut \u03c6 is the phase shift, which is given by tan \u03c6 = (sqrt(30)/10).\n\nSo, \u03c6 = arctan(sqrt(30)/10).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can compute this.\n\nBut maybe it's better to express B in terms of this equation.\n\nBut perhaps I can find sin B and cos B from this.\n\nAlternatively, let me square both sides of the equation 10 sin B + sqrt(30) cos B =2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo,\n\n(10 sin B + sqrt(30) cos B)^2 = (2 sqrt(30))^2.\n\nWhich is:\n\n100 sin\u00b2 B + 20 sqrt(30) sin B cos B +30 cos\u00b2 B = 120.\n\nSimplify:\n\n100 sin\u00b2 B + 30 cos\u00b2 B +20 sqrt(30) sin B cos B =120.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n100 sin\u00b2 B +30 cos\u00b2 B +20 sqrt(30) sin B cos B =120.\n\nHmm, perhaps using the identity sin\u00b2 B =1 - cos\u00b2 B.\n\nSo,\n\n100(1 - cos\u00b2 B) +30 cos\u00b2 B +20 sqrt(30) sin B cos B =120.\n\nExpanding:\n\n100 -100 cos\u00b2 B +30 cos\u00b2 B +20 sqrt(30) sin B cos B =120.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n100 -70 cos\u00b2 B +20 sqrt(30) sin B cos B =120.\n\nBring 100 to the other side:\n\n-70 cos\u00b2 B +20 sqrt(30) sin B cos B =20.\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n-7 cos\u00b2 B +2 sqrt(30) sin B cos B =2.\n\nHmm, this is still complicated, but perhaps I can express it in terms of sin 2B or cos 2B.\n\nLet me note that cos\u00b2 B = (1 + cos 2B)/2, and sin B cos B = (sin 2B)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n-7*(1 + cos 2B)/2 +2 sqrt(30)*(sin 2B)/2 =2.\n\nMultiply through:\n\n-7/2 (1 + cos 2B) + sqrt(30) sin 2B =2.\n\nMultiply everything by 2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-7(1 + cos 2B) +2 sqrt(30) sin 2B =4.\n\nExpand:\n\n-7 -7 cos 2B +2 sqrt(30) sin 2B =4.\n\nBring -7 to the other side:\n\n-7 cos 2B +2 sqrt(30) sin 2B =11.\n\nHmm, this is a linear combination of sin 2B and cos 2B. Let me write it as R sin(2B + \u03c6) =11, where R is the amplitude.\n\nCompute R:\n\nR = sqrt( (-7)^2 + (2 sqrt(30))^2 )=sqrt(49 +120)=sqrt(169)=13.\n\nSo,\n\n13 sin(2B + \u03c6) =11,\n\nwhere \u03c6 is such that:\n\ncos \u03c6 = (2 sqrt(30))/13,\n\nsin \u03c6 = -7/13.\n\nSo,\n\nsin(2B + \u03c6) =11/13.\n\nThus,\n\n2B + \u03c6 = arcsin(11/13).\n\nSo,\n\n2B = arcsin(11/13) - \u03c6.\n\nBut \u03c6 = arctan( (2 sqrt(30))/(-7) ), but since cos \u03c6 = (2 sqrt(30))/13 and sin \u03c6 = -7/13, \u03c6 is in the fourth quadrant.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can compute this angle numerically, but maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that sin(2B + \u03c6) =11/13, and then expressing 2B in terms of this.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to find sin 2B and cos 2B from this.\n\nLet me denote \u03b8 = 2B + \u03c6.\n\nThen, sin \u03b8 =11/13.\n\nSo, cos \u03b8 = sqrt(1 - (121/169))=sqrt(48/169)=4 sqrt(3)/13.\n\nSo, cos \u03b8 =4 sqrt(3)/13.\n\nNow, from the angle addition formula:\n\nsin \u03b8 = sin(2B + \u03c6) = sin 2B cos \u03c6 + cos 2B sin \u03c6.\n\nBut sin \u03b8 =11/13,\n\nAnd,\n\nsin 2B cos \u03c6 + cos 2B sin \u03c6 =11/13.\n\nBut cos \u03c6 =2 sqrt(30)/13, sin \u03c6 =-7/13.\n\nSo,\n\nsin 2B*(2 sqrt(30)/13) + cos 2B*(-7/13) =11/13.\n\nMultiply both sides by 13:\n\n2 sqrt(30) sin 2B -7 cos 2B =11.\n\nHmm, but from earlier, we had:\n\n-7 cos 2B +2 sqrt(30) sin 2B =11.\n\nWhich is the same as this equation. So, we have:\n\n2 sqrt(30) sin 2B -7 cos 2B =11.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can solve for sin 2B and cos 2B.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n2 sqrt(30) sin 2B -7 cos 2B =11.\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\n(2 sqrt(30) sin 2B -7 cos 2B)^2 =121.\n\nWhich is:\n\n4*30 sin\u00b2 2B -2*2 sqrt(30)*7 sin 2B cos 2B +49 cos\u00b2 2B =121.\n\nSimplify:\n\n120 sin\u00b2 2B -28 sqrt(30) sin 2B cos 2B +49 cos\u00b2 2B =121.\n\nHmm, this is getting too involved. Maybe I should consider that this problem might have an integer answer, so perhaps the product AB \u00b7 AC is an integer, and I can find it without finding all the sides.\n\nWait, since AB =26 sin(\u03b8/2) and AC=26 sin(\u03b8/2 + A), their product is 676 sin(\u03b8/2) sin(\u03b8/2 + A).\n\nBut from earlier, we found that IA =2 sqrt(39), and IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2)=sqrt(36 + (s -a)^2)=sqrt(36 +120)=sqrt(156)=2 sqrt(39), which checks out.\n\nHmm, perhaps using the formula for the product of the distances from the inradius to the sides.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities to find AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nWait, another idea: AB \u00b7 AC can be expressed as AB * AC = c * b.\n\nBut from earlier, we have a =4 sqrt(30), and b + c =8 sqrt(30).\n\nAlso, from the law of cosines, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nWe know a\u00b2 =480, cos A =7/13.\n\nSo,\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 bc*(7/13).\n\nBut we also have b + c =8 sqrt(30).\n\nLet me square both sides: (b + c)^2 =64*30=1920.\n\nWhich is:\n\nb\u00b2 + 2 bc + c\u00b2 =1920.\n\nSo, from this,\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =1920 -2 bc.\n\nSubstituting into the law of cosines equation:\n\n480 = (1920 -2 bc) - 2 bc*(7/13).\n\nSimplify:\n\n480 =1920 -2 bc - (14 bc)/13.\n\nCombine the bc terms:\n\n=1920 - [2 bc + (14 bc)/13] =1920 - [ (26 bc +14 bc)/13 ]=1920 - (40 bc)/13.\n\nSo,\n\n480 =1920 - (40 bc)/13.\n\nRearrange:\n\n(40 bc)/13 =1920 -480=1440.\n\nMultiply both sides by 13:\n\n40 bc =1440 *13=18720.\n\nDivide by40:\n\nbc=18720 /40=468.\n\nSo, bc=468.\n\nThus, AB * AC =b * c=468.\n\nSo, the product AB \u00b7 AC is 468.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nWe have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's break this down. I remember that the circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle, and the inradius r is also related to the area and semiperimeter. Since we have both R and r, maybe I can connect them somehow.\n\nFirst, let's recall some formulas:\n\n1. The circumradius R of triangle ABC is given by R = (a b c) / (4\u0394), where a, b, c are the sides, and \u0394 is the area.\n2. The inradius r is given by r = \u0394 / s, where s is the semiperimeter, s = (a + b + c) / 2.\n3. Also, the distance between the incenter I and circumcenter O can be found using the formula: OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that right? Let me think. Yes, I think that's correct. So OI squared equals R times (R minus twice the inradius).\n\nBut wait, in this problem, it's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. That must mean that the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. But maybe I can use coordinate geometry or vector methods here. Alternatively, maybe there's a geometric property or theorem that connects this perpendicularity condition with other elements of the triangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use coordinate geometry. Let me consider placing the triangle in a coordinate system to make things easier.\n\nLet me try to position the triangle such that point A is at (0, 0), and the line IA is along the y-axis. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, then OI must be horizontal, along the x-axis. Hmm, not sure if that's the best approach, but let me try.\n\nWait, another thought. Let's denote some variables. Let me denote the sides opposite to A, B, C as a, b, c respectively. So BC = a, AC = b, AB = c. Then, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nWe know R = 13, so from the formula R = (a b c)/(4\u0394), we can write \u0394 = (a b c)/(4R) = (a b c)/(52).\n\nAnd r = 6, so r = \u0394 / s => 6 = \u0394 / s => \u0394 = 6s.\n\nSo, setting these equal: (a b c)/(52) = 6s => a b c = 312 s.\n\nHmm, that's one equation. But we have three variables a, b, c, so more equations are needed.\n\nAlso, since OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r) = 13(13 - 12) = 13(1) = 13. So OI = sqrt(13).\n\nWait, OI is the distance between the incenter and circumradius. There's another formula: OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Let me check that. Oh, wait, the formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So plugging in the values:\n\nOI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is indeed sqrt(13), which matches what I had before.\n\nBut how does the fact that IA is perpendicular to OI come into play?\n\nHmm. Maybe I can use vectors. Let me denote the position vectors of points A, B, C, I, O with respect to some origin.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use coordinate geometry. Let's place the circumcenter O at the origin for simplicity. Then, since O is the circumcenter, all the vertices lie on a circle of radius 13 centered at O.\n\nThe incenter I has coordinates (x, y), and we know that OI has length sqrt(13), so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 13.\n\nNow, IA is perpendicular to OI. Vector IA would be from I to A. If O is at (0,0), and A is at some point (let's say A is at (a, b) on the circumcircle, so a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169.\n\nThen vector IA is (a - x, b - y). Vector OI is (x, y). The dot product of IA and OI should be zero because they are perpendicular. So:\n\n(a - x) * x + (b - y) * y = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\na x + b y - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 0\n\nBut since x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 13, this becomes:\n\na x + b y = 13\n\nHmm, okay. Also, since A lies on the circumcircle, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 169.\n\nHmm. Now, this might not be directly helpful yet, but perhaps I can find expressions for x and y in terms of the triangle's properties.\n\nWait, the inradius is 6, so r = 6. The inradius is the distance from I to any side, which is also the radius of the incircle. Also, the inradius is related to the area and semiperimeter: r = \u0394 / s, so \u0394 = 6s.\n\nWe also have the area \u0394 = (a b c)/(4R) = (a b c)/52. So, as I found before, a b c = 312 s.\n\nWait, but I don't know s yet. Hmm.\n\nAnother thought: maybe using trigonometric identities. Let me recall that in any triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the angles and sides.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for the length of IA. The length of IA can be given by IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Is that right? Wait, let me recall. The inradius is related to the exradius, but perhaps IA is the distance from the inradius to vertex A.\n\nWait, yes, I think the formula is IA = 2R sin(A/2), where R is the circumradius. Wait, no, that might be for the exradius. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, I think the formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A is IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Wait, let me confirm.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A can be expressed as IA = (r) / sin(A/2). I think that's correct. Let me see.\n\nYes, because in the inradius formulas, the inradius r is related to the angles. The formula IA = (r) / sin(A/2) makes sense, as it's derived from the properties of the inradius and the angle bisectors.\n\nSimilarly, IB = (r) / sin(B/2), IC = (r) / sin(C/2).\n\nSo, IA = 6 / sin(A/2). Since we know IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps we can find some relationship using that.\n\nWait, but IA is perpendicular to OI. Since O is the circumradius, which is at the origin, and I is somewhere inside the triangle.\n\nWait, maybe we can use coordinate geometry. Let me think again.\n\nLet me place the circumcenter O at the origin (0,0). Then, the coordinates of A, B, C lie on the circle of radius 13. Let me denote A as (13, 0) for simplicity, so it's on the x-axis. Then, the coordinates of A are (13, 0).\n\nWait, but then I is the incenter, which is at some point (x, y). The inradius is 6, so the distance from I to each side is 6.\n\nBut maybe it's better to place A at (13, 0), B at (13 cos \u03b8, 13 sin \u03b8), and C at (13 cos \u03c6, 13 sin \u03c6). Then, the incenter I has coordinates (x, y), which can be found using the formula for the incenter.\n\nWait, the incenter coordinates can be found as ( (a A_x + b B_x + c C_x ) / (a + b + c ), (a A_y + b B_y + c C_y ) / (a + b + c ) ), where a, b, c are the lengths of the sides opposite to A, B, C.\n\nBut since I'm setting A at (13, 0), B and C at other points on the circle, this might get complicated. Maybe another approach.\n\nWait, another idea: since IA is perpendicular to OI, and O is the circumradius, perhaps we can use vector dot product.\n\nLet me consider vectors. Let me denote vector IA as A - I, and vector OI as I - O, but O is at (0,0), so OI is just I. So, IA \u00b7 OI = 0.\n\nSo, (A - I) \u00b7 I = 0.\n\nWhich implies A \u00b7 I - |I|\u00b2 = 0.\n\nBut since A is on the circumcircle, |A| = R = 13. So, A \u00b7 I = |I|\u00b2.\n\nBut |I| is OI, which is sqrt(13). So, A \u00b7 I = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 = 13.\n\nSo, A \u00b7 I = 13.\n\nBut A is the point (13, 0) in my coordinate system. Wait, no, in my initial assumption, I placed A at (13, 0), so A = (13, 0). Then, vector A is (13, 0), and vector I is (x, y). So, their dot product is 13x + 0*y = 13x.\n\nSo, 13x = 13 => x = 1.\n\nSo, the x-coordinate of I is 1.\n\nThat's a useful piece of information.\n\nSo, I is at (1, y). And since OI = sqrt(13), the distance from O to I is sqrt(1\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(1 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(13). So,\n\nsqrt(1 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(13)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n1 + y\u00b2 = 13 => y\u00b2 = 12 => y = sqrt(12) or y = -sqrt(12). Since in a triangle, the inradius is inside, and depending on the orientation, but let's assume y is positive, so y = 2*sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the coordinates of I are (1, 2\u221a3).\n\nNow, I is the incenter, so its coordinates can also be expressed in terms of the sides a, b, c.\n\nWait, in my coordinate system, A is at (13, 0), B is at some point (13 cos \u03b8, 13 sin \u03b8), and C is at some other point (13 cos \u03c6, 13 sin \u03c6).\n\nThe incenter I has coordinates:\n\n( (a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x ) / (a + b + c ), (a*A_y + b*B_y + c*C_y ) / (a + b + c ) )\n\nBut in our case, A is (13, 0), B is (13 cos \u03b8, 13 sin \u03b8), C is (13 cos \u03c6, 13 sin \u03c6).\n\nSo, the x-coordinate of I is (a*13 + b*(13 cos \u03b8) + c*(13 cos \u03c6)) / (a + b + c ) = 1.\n\nSimilarly, the y-coordinate is (a*0 + b*(13 sin \u03b8) + c*(13 sin \u03c6)) / (a + b + c ) = 2\u221a3.\n\nSo, let me write these equations.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n[13a + 13b cos \u03b8 + 13c cos \u03c6] / (a + b + c ) = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by (a + b + c ):\n\n13a + 13b cos \u03b8 + 13c cos \u03c6 = a + b + c\n\nSimplify:\n\n13a - a + 13b cos \u03b8 - b + 13c cos \u03c6 - c = 0\n\nWhich is:\n\n12a + 12b cos \u03b8 + 12c cos \u03c6 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 12:\n\na + b cos \u03b8 + c cos \u03c6 = 0\n\nWait, that seems odd. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me go back.\n\nEquation 1:\n\n[13a + 13b cos \u03b8 + 13c cos \u03c6] = (a + b + c )\n\nWhich is:\n\n13a + 13b cos \u03b8 + 13c cos \u03c6 = a + b + c\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n13a - a + 13b cos \u03b8 - b + 13c cos \u03c6 - c = 0\n\nWhich is:\n\n12a + 12b cos \u03b8 + 12c cos \u03c6 = 0\n\nDivide by 12:\n\na + b cos \u03b8 + c cos \u03c6 = 0\n\nHmm, okay. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, the y-coordinate equation:\n\n[0*a + 13b sin \u03b8 + 13c sin \u03c6] = (2\u221a3)(a + b + c )\n\nSo:\n\n13b sin \u03b8 + 13c sin \u03c6 = 2\u221a3 (a + b + c )\n\nDivide both sides by 13:\n\nb sin \u03b8 + c sin \u03c6 = (2\u221a3 /13)(a + b + c )\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nNow, I also know that points B and C are on the circumcircle of radius 13, so their coordinates satisfy:\n\n(13 cos \u03b8)^2 + (13 sin \u03b8)^2 = 169, which is true for any \u03b8.\n\nSo, maybe I can find expressions for cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8, cos \u03c6, sin \u03c6 in terms of the triangle's sides.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, the sides can be expressed in terms of the angles. Using the law of sines, a = 2R sin A, but wait, no, actually, a = 2R sin A, but wait, no, the law of sines says a / sin A = 2R.\n\nSo, a = 2R sin A = 26 sin A, similarly b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSo, a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSo, we can express a, b, c in terms of the angles.\n\nBut then, the angles at A, B, C are related to the positions of points B and C on the circumcircle.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express cos \u03b8 and cos \u03c6 in terms of the triangle's angles.\n\nWait, in the coordinate system, point A is at (13, 0), and points B and C are at angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 from the positive x-axis. Then, the angle at A is angle BAC, which is the angle between vectors AB and AC.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's directly helpful. Maybe another approach.\n\nWait, from the law of sines, a = 26 sin A, etc. So, the sides are proportional to the sines of their opposite angles.\n\nAlso, in the coordinate system, the angle \u03b8 for point B is the angle from the x-axis to point B, and similarly for \u03c6.\n\nBut perhaps I can relate \u03b8 and \u03c6 to the angles of the triangle. Hmm, maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that in triangle ABC, the angles at B and C are related to the arcs between the points.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think about the angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 as the angles corresponding to points B and C in the circumcircle. Then, the central angles for arcs BC, AC, and AB would be 2A, 2B, 2C respectively.\n\nWait, in a circle, the central angle corresponding to an arc is twice the inscribed angle. So, the central angle for arc BC is 2A, for arc AC is 2B, and for arc AB is 2C.\n\nSo, the angle \u03b8 for point B is the angle from the x-axis to point B. Since point A is at (13, 0), the central angle from A to B is 2C, because in the circumcircle, the central angle over arc AB is 2C, where C is the angle at point C in triangle ABC.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me think: in the circumcircle, the central angle subtended by side BC is 2A. Because in the triangle, angle at A is opposite side BC, so the inscribed angle is A, and the central angle is 2A.\n\nSimilarly, the central angle subtended by side AC is 2B, and the central angle subtended by side AB is 2C.\n\nSo, in our coordinate system, point A is at (13, 0). The central angle from A to B is 2C, and from A to C is 2B, assuming the triangle is labeled in order.\n\nWait, but I think it's the other way around. The central angle over BC is 2A, so the angle between points B and C as viewed from the center is 2A. Similarly, the angle between A and B is 2C, and between A and C is 2B.\n\nWait, I think that's correct. So, if I have point A at (13, 0), then point B is at an angle of 2C from the positive x-axis, and point C is at an angle of -2B, assuming the triangle is oriented counterclockwise.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let me assume that the triangle is oriented so that point B is at an angle of 2C above the x-axis, and point C is at an angle of 2B below the x-axis, so that the central angles add up to 2A between B and C.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me denote the angles at the center corresponding to arcs BC, AC, and AB as 2A, 2B, and 2C respectively.\n\nSo, the central angle for arc BC is 2A, which is the angle between points B and C as seen from the center O. Similarly, the central angle for arc AC is 2B, and for arc AB is 2C.\n\nSince the total central angles around O add up to 360 degrees, we have 2A + 2B + 2C = 360\u00b0, which is consistent with A + B + C = 180\u00b0 in the triangle.\n\nSo, in our coordinate system, point A is at (13, 0). Let me place point B at an angle of \u03b8 from the x-axis, and point C at an angle of -\u03c6, so that the central angles between A and B is \u03b8, between A and C is \u03c6, and the central angle between B and C is 2A.\n\nWait, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps I can set point B at angle 2C from the x-axis, and point C at angle -2B, so that the central angle between B and C is 2C + 2B, which would be 2(A + B + C) but that's 360\u00b0, which is not correct. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assign point B at angle 2C, and point C at angle -2B, so that the central angle between B and C is 2C + 2B, which equals 2(A + B + C - A) = 2(180 - A) + something... Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, maybe I should proceed with the expressions I have.\n\nSo, from earlier, I have:\n\na + b cos \u03b8 + c cos \u03c6 = 0  ...(1)\n\nand\n\nb sin \u03b8 + c sin \u03c6 = (2\u221a3 /13)(a + b + c )  ...(2)\n\nAlso, a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nHmm, and from the triangle, A + B + C = \u03c0.\n\nBut perhaps I can express \u03b8 and \u03c6 in terms of the angles of the triangle.\n\nWait, since point A is at (13, 0), point B is at (13 cos \u03b8, 13 sin \u03b8), and point C is at (13 cos \u03c6, 13 sin \u03c6).\n\nThe angle at A is angle BAC, which is the angle between vectors AB and AC. But perhaps it's better to relate the central angles to the triangle's angles.\n\nWait, the central angle over arc BC is 2A, so the angle between points B and C as seen from O is 2A. So, the angle between vectors OB and OC is 2A.\n\nSimilarly, the central angle over arc AC is 2B, and over arc AB is 2C.\n\nSo, if I place point A at (13, 0), then point B is at an angle of \u03b1, and point C is at an angle of \u03b2, such that the angle between OB and OC is 2A, so \u03b2 - \u03b1 = 2A.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right way. Maybe I can assign \u03b8 as the angle for point B and \u03c6 as the angle for point C, so that \u03c6 - \u03b8 = 2A.\n\nWait, maybe. So, if point B is at angle \u03b8, then point C is at angle \u03b8 + 2A.\n\nWait, that could make sense, because the central angle between B and C is 2A.\n\nSo, let me assume that point B is at angle \u03b8, and point C is at angle \u03b8 + 2A.\n\nThen, their coordinates are:\n\nB: (13 cos \u03b8, 13 sin \u03b8)\n\nC: (13 cos (\u03b8 + 2A), 13 sin (\u03b8 + 2A))\n\nHmm, okay. Then, the angle at A is A, which is the angle between vectors AB and AC.\n\nWait, vector AB is from A to B: (13 cos \u03b8 - 13, 13 sin \u03b8 - 0) = (13 (cos \u03b8 - 1), 13 sin \u03b8)\n\nSimilarly, vector AC is from A to C: (13 cos (\u03b8 + 2A) - 13, 13 sin (\u03b8 + 2A) - 0) = (13 (cos (\u03b8 + 2A) - 1), 13 sin (\u03b8 + 2A))\n\nThe angle between vectors AB and AC is A. So, the dot product of AB and AC is |AB| |AC| cos A.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the law of cosines in the triangle to find relations between the sides.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can use the fact that the inradius is 6 and the semiperimeter is s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nWe also have that area \u0394 = 6s = (a b c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a b c)/52 => a b c = 312 s.\n\nHmm, but without knowing s, this might not be directly helpful yet.\n\nWait, maybe I can find s in terms of the sides. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula that relates the inradius, semiperimeter, and the distance from the incenter to the circumradius.\n\nWait, another idea: in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumradius is given by OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r), which we have as 13.\n\nBut we also have that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, perhaps using Pythagoras' theorem in triangle OIA.\n\nWait, in triangle OIA, since IA is perpendicular to OI, then OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nBut OA is the circumradius, which is 13. OI is sqrt(13). IA is the distance from I to A, which we had as IA = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nSo, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 => 13\u00b2 = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 + (IA)\u00b2 => 169 = 13 + IA\u00b2 => IA\u00b2 = 156 => IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nBut earlier, I thought IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2). So, 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39) => sin(A/2) = 6 / (2\u221a39) = 3 / \u221a39 = \u221a39 / 13.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3 / \u221a39 can be rationalized as 3\u221a39 / 39 = \u221a39 / 13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = \u221a39 / 13.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, from this, we can find cos(A/2) using Pythagorean identity: cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2(A/2)) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nNow, from trigonometric identities, we have:\n\nsin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(\u221a39/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = 2*(\u221a(39*130))/169.\n\nWait, 39 * 130 = 39*13*10 = 507*10 = 5070. Hmm, sqrt(5070) can be simplified.\n\nWait, 5070 = 10 * 507 = 10 * 3 * 169 = 10 * 3 * 13\u00b2. So, sqrt(5070) = 13 * sqrt(30).\n\nWait, because sqrt(10 * 3 * 13\u00b2) = 13 * sqrt(30).\n\nSo, sin A = 2*(13*sqrt(30))/169 = (26 sqrt(30)) / 169 = (2 sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSince a = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 2*2 sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\na = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = (26)*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = (26/13)*2 sqrt(30) = 2*2 sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nYes, that's correct. So, side a (BC) is 4 sqrt(30).\n\nNow, that's a good start. Now, perhaps we can find the other sides.\n\nWait, but we need AB \u00b7 AC, which are sides c and b respectively.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find expressions for b and c in terms of the angles.\n\nWait, using the law of sines: a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C = 2R = 26.\n\nSo, a = 4 sqrt(30) = 26 sin A, which matches because sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13, so 26*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 4 sqrt(30), correct.\n\nSimilarly, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSo, if we can find angles B and C, we can find b and c.\n\nWe know that A + B + C = \u03c0, so B + C = \u03c0 - A.\n\nHmm, and we can perhaps find expressions involving B and C using the earlier equations.\n\nWait, from the first equation we had in the coordinate system:\n\na + b cos \u03b8 + c cos \u03c6 = 0.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful anymore. Alternatively, perhaps using the second equation.\n\nWait, another thought: from the area, since \u0394 = 6s, and also \u0394 = (a b c)/(4R) = (a b c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a b c)/52 => a b c = 312 s.\n\nBut a = 4 sqrt(30), so:\n\n4 sqrt(30) * b * c = 312 s.\n\nHmm, but s = (a + b + c)/2, so we can write:\n\n4 sqrt(30) * b * c = 312 * (a + b + c)/2 = 156 (a + b + c).\n\nBut this seems a bit involved, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the inradius in terms of the sides.\n\nr = \u0394 / s => 6 = \u0394 / s => \u0394 = 6s.\n\nAlso, from Heron's formula, \u0394 = sqrt[s (s - a) (s - b) (s - c)].\n\nBut perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, let me think about the formula for the area in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter: \u0394 = r s = 6s.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed as (1/2)ab sin C, etc. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.\n\nWait, another idea: since we know a, maybe we can find expressions for b and c using the fact that a + b + c = 2s.\n\nWait, but I don't know s yet. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me try to find cos A.\n\nWe have sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13, so cos A = sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2 A) = sqrt(1 - (4*30)/169) = sqrt(1 - 120/169) = sqrt(49/169) = 7/13.\n\nSo, cos A = 7/13.\n\nNow, using the law of cosines: a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nWe have a = 4 sqrt(30), so a\u00b2 = 16 * 30 = 480.\n\nSo, 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13).\n\nHmm, that's one equation involving b and c.\n\nWe also know from the law of sines that b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSince A + B + C = \u03c0, and we have angle A known, perhaps we can find B and C in terms of each other.\n\nWait, but I don't know angle A's measure, only that sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13 and cos A = 7/13.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can express sin B and sin C in terms of angle A.\n\nWait, another idea: using the formula for the area \u0394 = (1/2) b c sin A.\n\nBut \u0394 = 6s, and s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, 6s = (1/2) b c sin A => 12s = b c sin A.\n\nBut from earlier, a b c = 312 s => (4 sqrt(30)) b c = 312 s => b c = (312 s) / (4 sqrt(30)) ) = (78 s) / sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, but from \u0394 = 6s, and \u0394 = (1/2) b c sin A, so:\n\n6s = (1/2) b c sin A => 12s = b c sin A.\n\nBut we have b c = (78 s) / sqrt(30), so:\n\n12 s = (78 s / sqrt(30)) * sin A.\n\nDivide both sides by s (assuming s \u2260 0):\n\n12 = (78 / sqrt(30)) * sin A.\n\nBut sin A is 2 sqrt(30)/13, so:\n\n12 = (78 / sqrt(30)) * (2 sqrt(30)/13).\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n78 / sqrt(30) * 2 sqrt(30)/13 = (78 * 2) / 13 = (156)/13 = 12.\n\nSo, 12 = 12, which is consistent. Hmm, so that doesn't give me new information.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nWait, from the earlier equations, perhaps I can find expressions for cos \u03b8 and cos \u03c6.\n\nWait, in the coordinate system, point I is at (1, 2\u221a3). The inradius is 6, so the distance from I to each side is 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula for the inradius in terms of the coordinates. Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula that relates the inradius, the sides, and the distances from the incenter to the vertices.\n\nWait, another thought: since I is the incenter, the distances from I to the sides are equal to the inradius, which is 6.\n\nIn our coordinate system, the sides BC, AC, and AB are lines. The distance from I to each of these lines is 6.\n\nPerhaps I can find the equations of these lines and set their distance from I to 6.\n\nLet me attempt that.\n\nFirst, find the equation of side BC. Points B and C are at (13 cos \u03b8, 13 sin \u03b8) and (13 cos \u03c6, 13 sin \u03c6). The equation of line BC can be found using the two-point form.\n\nBut maybe it's better to find the general equation for line BC.\n\nThe general equation of a line through two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is (y - y1)(x2 - x1) = (y2 - y1)(x - x1).\n\nSo, the equation of BC is (y - 13 sin \u03b8)(13 cos \u03c6 - 13 cos \u03b8) = (13 sin \u03c6 - 13 sin \u03b8)(x - 13 cos \u03b8).\n\nSimplify this:\n\n(y - 13 sin \u03b8)(cos \u03c6 - cos \u03b8) = (sin \u03c6 - sin \u03b8)(x - 13 cos \u03b8)\n\nDivide both sides by 13:\n\n(y - sin \u03b8)(cos \u03c6 - cos \u03b8) = ( (sin \u03c6 - sin \u03b8)/13 )(x - cos \u03b8 )\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line.\n\nThe distance from I (1, 2\u221a3) to line BC is 6.\n\nThe formula for the distance from point (x0, y0) to line ax + by + c = 0 is |a x0 + b y0 + c| / sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2).\n\nSo, I need the equation of line BC in the form ax + by + c = 0.\n\nLet me find the equation of line BC.\n\nPoints B and C are at (13 cos \u03b8, 13 sin \u03b8) and (13 cos \u03c6, 13 sin \u03c6). The slope of BC is (13 sin \u03c6 - 13 sin \u03b8)/(13 cos \u03c6 - 13 cos \u03b8) = (sin \u03c6 - sin \u03b8)/(cos \u03c6 - cos \u03b8).\n\nUsing the identity, sin \u03c6 - sin \u03b8 = 2 cos( (\u03c6 + \u03b8)/2 ) sin( (\u03c6 - \u03b8)/2 )\n\nAnd cos \u03c6 - cos \u03b8 = -2 sin( (\u03c6 + \u03b8)/2 ) sin( (\u03c6 - \u03b8)/2 )\n\nSo, the slope m is [2 cos( (\u03c6 + \u03b8)/2 ) sin( (\u03c6 - \u03b8)/2 ) ] / [ -2 sin( (\u03c6 + \u03b8)/2 ) sin( (\u03c6 - \u03b8)/2 ) ] = - cot( (\u03c6 + \u03b8)/2 )\n\nSo, the slope m = -cot( (\u03c6 + \u03b8)/2 )\n\nSo, the equation of line BC can be written as y - 13 sin \u03b8 = m (x - 13 cos \u03b8 )\n\nSo, y = m x - m *13 cos \u03b8 + 13 sin \u03b8.\n\nNow, write this in standard form: m x - y - (m *13 cos \u03b8 - 13 sin \u03b8) = 0.\n\nSo, the equation is m x - y + c = 0, where c = - (m *13 cos \u03b8 - 13 sin \u03b8 )\n\nNow, the distance from I (1, 2\u221a3) to this line is |m*1 - 1*(2\u221a3) + c| / sqrt(m\u00b2 + 1) ) = 6.\n\nSo,\n\n|m - 2\u221a3 + c| / sqrt(m\u00b2 + 1) = 6.\n\nBut c = - (m *13 cos \u03b8 - 13 sin \u03b8 )\n\nSo,\n\n|m - 2\u221a3 - m *13 cos \u03b8 + 13 sin \u03b8 | / sqrt(m\u00b2 + 1) ) = 6.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I can find a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps using the fact that the inradius is the distance from I to each side, which is 6. So, the distance from I to BC is 6, and similarly for AB and AC.\n\nWait, but in our coordinate system, point A is at (13, 0), I is at (1, 2\u221a3). The distance from I to side AB is 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find the equation of side AB and compute its distance from I.\n\nWait, side AB is from A (13, 0) to B (13 cos \u03b8, 13 sin \u03b8). The slope of AB is (13 sin \u03b8 - 0)/(13 cos \u03b8 - 13) = (sin \u03b8)/(cos \u03b8 - 1).\n\nThe equation of AB can be written as y = [sin \u03b8 / (cos \u03b8 - 1)] (x - 13).\n\nLet me write this in standard form: [sin \u03b8] (x - 13) - [cos \u03b8 - 1] y = 0.\n\nSo, sin \u03b8 x - 13 sin \u03b8 - (cos \u03b8 - 1) y = 0.\n\nSo, the distance from I (1, 2\u221a3) to this line is |sin \u03b8 *1 - 13 sin \u03b8 - (cos \u03b8 - 1)*2\u221a3| / sqrt( sin\u00b2 \u03b8 + (cos \u03b8 - 1)^2 ) ) = 6.\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\n| sin \u03b8 -13 sin \u03b8 - (cos \u03b8 - 1)*2\u221a3 | = | -12 sin \u03b8 - 2\u221a3 (cos \u03b8 - 1) |.\n\nWhich is | -12 sin \u03b8 - 2\u221a3 cos \u03b8 + 2\u221a3 |.\n\nThe denominator is sqrt( sin\u00b2 \u03b8 + (cos \u03b8 - 1)^2 ).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nsin\u00b2 \u03b8 + (cos \u03b8 - 1)^2 = sin\u00b2 \u03b8 + cos\u00b2 \u03b8 - 2 cos \u03b8 + 1 = (sin\u00b2 \u03b8 + cos\u00b2 \u03b8) + (-2 cos \u03b8 + 1) = 1 + (-2 cos \u03b8 + 1) = 2 - 2 cos \u03b8 = 2(1 - cos \u03b8).\n\nSo, denominator = sqrt(2(1 - cos \u03b8)).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n| -12 sin \u03b8 - 2\u221a3 cos \u03b8 + 2\u221a3 | / sqrt(2(1 - cos \u03b8)) ) = 6.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can simplify.\n\nLet me denote t = \u03b8. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n| -12 sin t - 2\u221a3 cos t + 2\u221a3 | = 6 * sqrt(2(1 - cos t)).\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the absolute value and the square root:\n\n( -12 sin t - 2\u221a3 cos t + 2\u221a3 )\u00b2 = 36 * 2 (1 - cos t )\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n= [ -12 sin t - 2\u221a3 cos t + 2\u221a3 ]\u00b2\n\n= ( -12 sin t )\u00b2 + ( -2\u221a3 cos t )\u00b2 + (2\u221a3 )\u00b2 + 2*(-12 sin t)*(-2\u221a3 cos t) + 2*(-12 sin t)*(2\u221a3 ) + 2*(-2\u221a3 cos t)*(2\u221a3 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(-12 sin t)^2 = 144 sin\u00b2 t\n\n(-2\u221a3 cos t)^2 = 4*3 cos\u00b2 t = 12 cos\u00b2 t\n\n(2\u221a3)^2 = 4*3 = 12\n\nCross terms:\n\n2*(-12 sin t)*(-2\u221a3 cos t) = 2*(24\u221a3 sin t cos t) = 48\u221a3 sin t cos t\n\n2*(-12 sin t)*(2\u221a3 ) = 2*(-24\u221a3 sin t ) = -48\u221a3 sin t\n\n2*(-2\u221a3 cos t)*(2\u221a3 ) = 2*(-4*3 cos t ) = 2*(-12 cos t ) = -24 cos t\n\nSo, adding all together:\n\n144 sin\u00b2 t + 12 cos\u00b2 t + 12 + 48\u221a3 sin t cos t - 48\u221a3 sin t -24 cos t.\n\nSo, left side becomes:\n\n144 sin\u00b2 t + 12 cos\u00b2 t + 12 + 48\u221a3 sin t cos t - 48\u221a3 sin t -24 cos t.\n\nThe right side is 72(1 - cos t) = 72 - 72 cos t.\n\nNow, moving everything to left:\n\n144 sin\u00b2 t + 12 cos\u00b2 t + 12 + 48\u221a3 sin t cos t - 48\u221a3 sin t -24 cos t -72 + 72 cos t = 0.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n144 sin\u00b2 t + 12 cos\u00b2 t + (12 -72) + 48\u221a3 sin t cos t -48\u221a3 sin t + (-24 cos t +72 cos t) = 0.\n\nWhich is:\n\n144 sin\u00b2 t + 12 cos\u00b2 t -60 + 48\u221a3 sin t cos t -48\u221a3 sin t +48 cos t = 0.\n\nHmm, this is getting quite involved. Maybe I can factor some terms.\n\nLet me note that 144 sin\u00b2 t + 12 cos\u00b2 t = 12 (12 sin\u00b2 t + cos\u00b2 t).\n\nHmm, perhaps not helpful. Alternatively, let's factor 12:\n\n12(12 sin\u00b2 t + cos\u00b2 t) -60 + 48\u221a3 sin t cos t -48\u221a3 sin t +48 cos t = 0.\n\nHmm, 12 sin\u00b2 t + cos\u00b2 t = 11 sin\u00b2 t + (sin\u00b2 t + cos\u00b2 t) = 11 sin\u00b2 t + 1.\n\nSo, 12(11 sin\u00b2 t + 1) -60 + 48\u221a3 sin t cos t -48\u221a3 sin t +48 cos t = 0.\n\nWhich is:\n\n132 sin\u00b2 t + 12 -60 + 48\u221a3 sin t cos t -48\u221a3 sin t +48 cos t = 0.\n\nSimplify constants: 12 -60 = -48.\n\nSo,\n\n132 sin\u00b2 t -48 + 48\u221a3 sin t cos t -48\u221a3 sin t +48 cos t = 0.\n\nDivide all terms by 12 to simplify:\n\n11 sin\u00b2 t -4 + 4\u221a3 sin t cos t -4\u221a3 sin t +4 cos t = 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor terms:\n\nLet me group terms:\n\n11 sin\u00b2 t +4\u221a3 sin t cos t -4\u221a3 sin t +4 cos t -4 = 0.\n\nThis is quite complex. Maybe I can express everything in terms of sin t and cos t, and see if I can factor it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use substitution. Let me set u = sin t, v = cos t, with u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = 1.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n11 u\u00b2 +4\u221a3 u v -4\u221a3 u +4 v -4 = 0.\n\nBut this is still a quadratic in u and v, which might not be easy to solve.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor this equation.\n\nLooking at 11 u\u00b2 +4\u221a3 u v -4\u221a3 u +4 v -4 = 0.\n\nLet me try to group terms:\n\n(11 u\u00b2) + (4\u221a3 u v -4\u221a3 u) + (4 v -4) = 0.\n\nFactor terms:\n\n11 u\u00b2 + 4\u221a3 u (v - 1) +4(v -1) = 0.\n\nHmm, so:\n\n11 u\u00b2 + (4\u221a3 u +4)(v -1) = 0.\n\nBut since v = cos t, and u = sin t, perhaps we can express this in terms of u and v.\n\nHmm, not sure. Maybe I can write this as:\n\n11 u\u00b2 + (4\u221a3 u +4)(v -1) = 0.\n\nBut since u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 =1, perhaps I can express v in terms of u or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write v = (something) in terms of u.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor further.\n\nWait, 11 u\u00b2 +4\u221a3 u (v -1) +4(v -1) = 0.\n\nLet me factor (v -1):\n\n= 11 u\u00b2 + (4\u221a3 u +4)(v -1) = 0.\n\nHmm, maybe I can write this as:\n\n11 u\u00b2 = -(4\u221a3 u +4)(v -1).\n\nBut since v = sqrt(1 - u\u00b2), assuming cos t is positive, which it might not be, but let's proceed.\n\nSo, 11 u\u00b2 = -(4\u221a3 u +4)(sqrt(1 - u\u00b2) -1).\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square root.\n\nWait, but before that, perhaps it's better to consider specific angles or see if there's a substitution that can simplify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this approach is too time-consuming, and I should look for a different method.\n\nWait, going back to the problem, I know that a = 4 sqrt(30), and I need to find AB \u00b7 AC, which are sides c and b respectively.\n\nWait, AB is the length from A to B, which is sqrt[ (13 cos \u03b8 -13)^2 + (13 sin \u03b8)^2 ].\n\nSimplify:\n\n= sqrt[ 169 (cos \u03b8 -1)^2 + 169 sin\u00b2 \u03b8 ]\n\n= 13 sqrt[ (cos \u03b8 -1)^2 + sin\u00b2 \u03b8 ]\n\n= 13 sqrt[ cos\u00b2 \u03b8 - 2 cos \u03b8 +1 + sin\u00b2 \u03b8 ]\n\n= 13 sqrt[ (cos\u00b2 \u03b8 + sin\u00b2 \u03b8) - 2 cos \u03b8 +1 ]\n\n= 13 sqrt[ 1 - 2 cos \u03b8 +1 ]\n\n= 13 sqrt[ 2 - 2 cos \u03b8 ]\n\n= 13 sqrt[ 2(1 - cos \u03b8) ]\n\n= 13 * 2 sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nBecause sqrt(2(1 - cos \u03b8)) = 2 sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo, AB = 26 sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSimilarly, AC can be found as 26 sin(\u03c6/2), where \u03c6 is the angle for point C.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the central angle between B and C is 2A, so \u03c6 - \u03b8 = 2A.\n\nHmm, so \u03c6 = \u03b8 + 2A.\n\nSo, AC = 26 sin( (\u03b8 + 2A)/2 ) = 26 sin( \u03b8/2 + A ).\n\nSo, AB \u00b7 AC = [26 sin(\u03b8/2)] * [26 sin(\u03b8/2 + A)] = 676 sin(\u03b8/2) sin(\u03b8/2 + A).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find \u03b8 in terms of A.\n\nWait, from earlier, we have point I at (1, 2\u221a3), which is the incenter. The inradius is 6, so the distance from I to each side is 6.\n\nIn particular, the distance from I to AB is 6, which we tried to use earlier but got stuck.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use trigonometric identities to find \u03b8.\n\nWait, from the earlier equation, after simplifying, I have:\n\n11 sin\u00b2 t -4 + 4\u221a3 sin t cos t -4\u221a3 sin t +4 cos t = 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write this in terms of sin(2t), cos(2t), etc.\n\nLet me use double-angle identities.\n\nWe know that sin(2t) = 2 sin t cos t, cos(2t) = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2 t, etc.\n\nLet me rewrite the equation:\n\n11 sin\u00b2 t +4\u221a3 sin t cos t -4\u221a3 sin t +4 cos t -4 = 0.\n\nExpress sin\u00b2 t as (1 - cos 2t)/2, and sin t cos t as (sin 2t)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n11*(1 - cos 2t)/2 +4\u221a3*(sin 2t)/2 -4\u221a3 sin t +4 cos t -4 = 0.\n\nMultiply through:\n\n(11/2)(1 - cos 2t) + 2\u221a3 sin 2t -4\u221a3 sin t +4 cos t -4 = 0.\n\nExpanding:\n\n11/2 - (11/2) cos 2t + 2\u221a3 sin 2t -4\u221a3 sin t +4 cos t -4 = 0.\n\nCombine constants: 11/2 -4 = (11 -8)/2 = 3/2.\n\nSo,\n\n3/2 - (11/2) cos 2t + 2\u221a3 sin 2t -4\u221a3 sin t +4 cos t = 0.\n\nHmm, this still looks complicated. Maybe I can rearrange terms.\n\nGroup the terms with cos 2t and sin 2t:\n\n- (11/2) cos 2t + 2\u221a3 sin 2t +4 cos t -4\u221a3 sin t +3/2 = 0.\n\nThis is getting too involved. Perhaps it's better to try to find \u03b8 numerically, but that's not helpful for an exact answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I can make an assumption to simplify. Let me assume that angle \u03b8 is such that the equation simplifies nicely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find another relation involving \u03b8.\n\nWait, from the earlier equation in the coordinate system, equation (1):\n\na + b cos \u03b8 + c cos \u03c6 = 0.\n\nBut a =4 sqrt(30), and \u03c6 = \u03b8 + 2A.\n\nSo, equation (1) becomes:\n\n4 sqrt(30) + b cos \u03b8 + c cos(\u03b8 + 2A) = 0.\n\nHmm, but without knowing b, c, or \u03b8, this might not help.\n\nWait, but from the law of sines, b = 26 sin B, c =26 sin C.\n\nAnd since B + C = \u03c0 - A, and from earlier, we have angle A known, perhaps we can express B and C in terms of a single variable.\n\nWait, let me denote angle B as \u03b1, then angle C = \u03c0 - A - \u03b1.\n\nSo, b = 26 sin \u03b1, c =26 sin(\u03c0 - A - \u03b1) =26 sin(A + \u03b1).\n\nSo, equation (1):\n\n4 sqrt(30) + 26 sin \u03b1 cos \u03b8 + 26 sin(A + \u03b1) cos(\u03b8 + 2A) = 0.\n\nHmm, but without knowing \u03b8, this is still difficult.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps using the fact that in triangle ABC, the inradius is 6, and the semiperimeter is s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nWe also have that the area \u0394 = 6s = (a b c)/(4R) = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/52.\n\nSo,\n\n6s = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/52.\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2, so:\n\n6*(a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/52.\n\nSimplify:\n\n3(a + b + c) = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/52.\n\nMultiply both sides by 52:\n\n156(a + b + c) = 4 sqrt(30) * b * c.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n39(a + b + c) = sqrt(30) * b * c.\n\nHmm, but from earlier, a =4 sqrt(30), so:\n\n39(4 sqrt(30) + b + c) = sqrt(30) * b * c.\n\nHmm, maybe we can express b + c in terms of s.\n\nWait, s = (a + b + c)/2, so b + c = 2s - a.\n\nBut I don't know s yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find expressions for b and c using the law of sines and the fact that a =4 sqrt(30).\n\nWait, from the law of sines, a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C =26.\n\nSo, b =26 sin B, c =26 sin C.\n\nSince B + C = \u03c0 - A, and we have sin B and sin C in terms of angle B.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can use the formula for the product of sides:\n\nb c = (26 sin B)(26 sin C) = 676 sin B sin C.\n\nAnd since C = \u03c0 - A - B,\n\nsin C = sin(\u03c0 - A - B) = sin(A + B).\n\nSo, b c = 676 sin B sin(A + B).\n\nHmm, perhaps using product-to-sum formulas.\n\nsin B sin(A + B) = [cos(A) - cos(2B + A)] / 2.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the product bc in terms of a and angles.\n\nWait, from the law of cosines, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nWe have a =4 sqrt(30), so 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13).\n\nHmm, and from earlier, bc = (312 s)/a = (312 s)/(4 sqrt(30)).\n\nBut without knowing s, this is still not helpful.\n\nWait, another approach: using the formula for the area in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter, and also in terms of the sides.\n\nWe have \u0394 = 6s = (1/2)ab sin C, etc.\n\nBut perhaps using \u0394 = 6s and \u0394 = (a b c)/(4R) = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/52.\n\nSo,\n\n6s = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/52.\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2, so:\n\n6*(a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/52.\n\nSimplify:\n\n3(a + b + c) = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/52.\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n3(a + b + c) = (sqrt(30)/13) * b * c.\n\nSo,\n\n3(a + b + c) = (sqrt(30)/13) * b * c.\n\nHmm, but without more information, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula for the area in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter, and also in terms of the sides.\n\nWait, another idea: from the formula for the distance from the incenter to the vertex.\n\nWe have IA = sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2), where s is the semiperimeter.\n\nWait, let me check this formula.\n\nYes, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = sqrt[r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2].\n\nWe have IA = sqrt(6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2) = sqrt(36 + (s - a)^2).\n\nBut earlier, we found IA = 2 sqrt(39), so:\n\nsqrt(36 + (s - a)^2) = 2 sqrt(39).\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n36 + (s - a)^2 = 4*39 = 156.\n\nSo,\n\n(s - a)^2 = 156 - 36 = 120.\n\nThus,\n\ns - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nSince s is the semiperimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2, so:\n\ns - a = (a + b + c)/2 - a = (-a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n(-a + b + c)/2 = 2 sqrt(30).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n-a + b + c = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nBut a =4 sqrt(30), so:\n\n-4 sqrt(30) + b + c =4 sqrt(30).\n\nThus,\n\nb + c = 8 sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, that's a useful equation.\n\nSo, b + c =8 sqrt(30).\n\nWe also have from the law of sines, b =26 sin B, c=26 sin C.\n\nAnd since B + C = \u03c0 - A, we can express C = \u03c0 - A - B.\n\nSo, c =26 sin(\u03c0 - A - B) =26 sin(A + B).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can use the sum formula for sine.\n\nsin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B.\n\nSo, c =26 [ sin A cos B + cos A sin B ].\n\nBut sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13, cos A =7/13.\n\nSo,\n\nc =26 [ (2 sqrt(30)/13) cos B + (7/13) sin B ]\n\n=26*(2 sqrt(30) cos B +7 sin B)/13\n\n=2*(2 sqrt(30) cos B +7 sin B )\n\n=4 sqrt(30) cos B +14 sin B.\n\nSimilarly, b =26 sin B.\n\nSo, from b + c =8 sqrt(30):\n\n26 sin B +4 sqrt(30) cos B +14 sin B =8 sqrt(30).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(26 sin B +14 sin B) +4 sqrt(30) cos B =8 sqrt(30).\n\nWhich is:\n\n40 sin B +4 sqrt(30) cos B =8 sqrt(30).\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n10 sin B + sqrt(30) cos B =2 sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, this is a linear combination of sin B and cos B. Let me write this as:\n\n10 sin B + sqrt(30) cos B =2 sqrt(30).\n\nI can express this as R sin(B + \u03c6) =2 sqrt(30), where R is the amplitude and \u03c6 is the phase shift.\n\nCompute R:\n\nR = sqrt(10\u00b2 + (sqrt(30))\u00b2 )= sqrt(100 +30)=sqrt(130).\n\nSo, 10 sin B + sqrt(30) cos B = sqrt(130) sin(B + \u03c6) =2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(130) sin(B + \u03c6) =2 sqrt(30).\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(130):\n\nsin(B + \u03c6) = (2 sqrt(30))/sqrt(130) = (2 sqrt(30))/sqrt(130).\n\nSimplify sqrt(30)/sqrt(130) = sqrt(30/130) = sqrt(3/13).\n\nSo,\n\nsin(B + \u03c6) = 2*sqrt(3/13) = 2 sqrt(39)/13.\n\nWait, because sqrt(3/13) is sqrt(39)/13? Wait, no:\n\nWait, sqrt(3/13) = sqrt(39)/13, because sqrt(3/13) = sqrt(3*13)/(13) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo, sin(B + \u03c6) =2*sqrt(39)/13.\n\nHmm, but the maximum value of sine is 1, so 2*sqrt(39)/13 must be less than or equal to 1.\n\nCompute 2*sqrt(39) \u22482*6.245\u224812.49, 12.49/13\u22480.96. So, yes, it's less than 1.\n\nSo, B + \u03c6 = arcsin(2 sqrt(39)/13).\n\nBut \u03c6 is the phase shift, which is given by tan \u03c6 = (sqrt(30)/10).\n\nSo, \u03c6 = arctan(sqrt(30)/10).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can compute this.\n\nBut maybe it's better to express B in terms of this equation.\n\nBut perhaps I can find sin B and cos B from this.\n\nAlternatively, let me square both sides of the equation 10 sin B + sqrt(30) cos B =2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo,\n\n(10 sin B + sqrt(30) cos B)^2 = (2 sqrt(30))^2.\n\nWhich is:\n\n100 sin\u00b2 B + 20 sqrt(30) sin B cos B +30 cos\u00b2 B = 120.\n\nSimplify:\n\n100 sin\u00b2 B + 30 cos\u00b2 B +20 sqrt(30) sin B cos B =120.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n100 sin\u00b2 B +30 cos\u00b2 B +20 sqrt(30) sin B cos B =120.\n\nHmm, perhaps using the identity sin\u00b2 B =1 - cos\u00b2 B.\n\nSo,\n\n100(1 - cos\u00b2 B) +30 cos\u00b2 B +20 sqrt(30) sin B cos B =120.\n\nExpanding:\n\n100 -100 cos\u00b2 B +30 cos\u00b2 B +20 sqrt(30) sin B cos B =120.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n100 -70 cos\u00b2 B +20 sqrt(30) sin B cos B =120.\n\nBring 100 to the other side:\n\n-70 cos\u00b2 B +20 sqrt(30) sin B cos B =20.\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n-7 cos\u00b2 B +2 sqrt(30) sin B cos B =2.\n\nHmm, this is still complicated, but perhaps I can express it in terms of sin 2B or cos 2B.\n\nLet me note that cos\u00b2 B = (1 + cos 2B)/2, and sin B cos B = (sin 2B)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n-7*(1 + cos 2B)/2 +2 sqrt(30)*(sin 2B)/2 =2.\n\nMultiply through:\n\n-7/2 (1 + cos 2B) + sqrt(30) sin 2B =2.\n\nMultiply everything by 2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-7(1 + cos 2B) +2 sqrt(30) sin 2B =4.\n\nExpand:\n\n-7 -7 cos 2B +2 sqrt(30) sin 2B =4.\n\nBring -7 to the other side:\n\n-7 cos 2B +2 sqrt(30) sin 2B =11.\n\nHmm, this is a linear combination of sin 2B and cos 2B. Let me write it as R sin(2B + \u03c6) =11, where R is the amplitude.\n\nCompute R:\n\nR = sqrt( (-7)^2 + (2 sqrt(30))^2 )=sqrt(49 +120)=sqrt(169)=13.\n\nSo,\n\n13 sin(2B + \u03c6) =11,\n\nwhere \u03c6 is such that:\n\ncos \u03c6 = (2 sqrt(30))/13,\n\nsin \u03c6 = -7/13.\n\nSo,\n\nsin(2B + \u03c6) =11/13.\n\nThus,\n\n2B + \u03c6 = arcsin(11/13).\n\nSo,\n\n2B = arcsin(11/13) - \u03c6.\n\nBut \u03c6 = arctan( (2 sqrt(30))/(-7) ), but since cos \u03c6 = (2 sqrt(30))/13 and sin \u03c6 = -7/13, \u03c6 is in the fourth quadrant.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can compute this angle numerically, but maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that sin(2B + \u03c6) =11/13, and then expressing 2B in terms of this.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to find sin 2B and cos 2B from this.\n\nLet me denote \u03b8 = 2B + \u03c6.\n\nThen, sin \u03b8 =11/13.\n\nSo, cos \u03b8 = sqrt(1 - (121/169))=sqrt(48/169)=4 sqrt(3)/13.\n\nSo, cos \u03b8 =4 sqrt(3)/13.\n\nNow, from the angle addition formula:\n\nsin \u03b8 = sin(2B + \u03c6) = sin 2B cos \u03c6 + cos 2B sin \u03c6.\n\nBut sin \u03b8 =11/13,\n\nAnd,\n\nsin 2B cos \u03c6 + cos 2B sin \u03c6 =11/13.\n\nBut cos \u03c6 =2 sqrt(30)/13, sin \u03c6 =-7/13.\n\nSo,\n\nsin 2B*(2 sqrt(30)/13) + cos 2B*(-7/13) =11/13.\n\nMultiply both sides by 13:\n\n2 sqrt(30) sin 2B -7 cos 2B =11.\n\nHmm, but from earlier, we had:\n\n-7 cos 2B +2 sqrt(30) sin 2B =11.\n\nWhich is the same as this equation. So, we have:\n\n2 sqrt(30) sin 2B -7 cos 2B =11.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can solve for sin 2B and cos 2B.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n2 sqrt(30) sin 2B -7 cos 2B =11.\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\n(2 sqrt(30) sin 2B -7 cos 2B)^2 =121.\n\nWhich is:\n\n4*30 sin\u00b2 2B -2*2 sqrt(30)*7 sin 2B cos 2B +49 cos\u00b2 2B =121.\n\nSimplify:\n\n120 sin\u00b2 2B -28 sqrt(30) sin 2B cos 2B +49 cos\u00b2 2B =121.\n\nHmm, this is getting too involved. Maybe I should consider that this problem might have an integer answer, so perhaps the product AB \u00b7 AC is an integer, and I can find it without finding all the sides.\n\nWait, since AB =26 sin(\u03b8/2) and AC=26 sin(\u03b8/2 + A), their product is 676 sin(\u03b8/2) sin(\u03b8/2 + A).\n\nBut from earlier, we found that IA =2 sqrt(39), and IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2)=sqrt(36 + (s -a)^2)=sqrt(36 +120)=sqrt(156)=2 sqrt(39), which checks out.\n\nHmm, perhaps using the formula for the product of the distances from the inradius to the sides.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities to find AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nWait, another idea: AB \u00b7 AC can be expressed as AB * AC = c * b.\n\nBut from earlier, we have a =4 sqrt(30), and b + c =8 sqrt(30).\n\nAlso, from the law of cosines, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nWe know a\u00b2 =480, cos A =7/13.\n\nSo,\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 bc*(7/13).\n\nBut we also have b + c =8 sqrt(30).\n\nLet me square both sides: (b + c)^2 =64*30=1920.\n\nWhich is:\n\nb\u00b2 + 2 bc + c\u00b2 =1920.\n\nSo, from this,\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =1920 -2 bc.\n\nSubstituting into the law of cosines equation:\n\n480 = (1920 -2 bc) - 2 bc*(7/13).\n\nSimplify:\n\n480 =1920 -2 bc - (14 bc)/13.\n\nCombine the bc terms:\n\n=1920 - [2 bc + (14 bc)/13] =1920 - [ (26 bc +14 bc)/13 ]=1920 - (40 bc)/13.\n\nSo,\n\n480 =1920 - (40 bc)/13.\n\nRearrange:\n\n(40 bc)/13 =1920 -480=1440.\n\nMultiply both sides by 13:\n\n40 bc =1440 *13=18720.\n\nDivide by40:\n\nbc=18720 /40=468.\n\nSo, bc=468.\n\nThus, AB * AC =b * c=468.\n\nSo, the product AB \u00b7 AC is 468.\n\n\nThe product of sides AB and AC in triangle ABC is 468.\n\n$\\boxed{468}$",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC.\n\nHmm, let's start by recalling some properties of triangle centers. The circumradius R is 13, which is given. The inradius r is 6. The incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors.\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, that gives a right angle at I between IA and OI. Maybe I can use some coordinate geometry here. Or perhaps there are some known formulas that relate R, r, and other triangle properties when IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe I can use the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. There's a formula that says OI^2 = R(R - 2r). Let me check that.\n\nYes, the formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So plugging in the given values, OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13).\n\nBut wait, in this problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. So triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at I. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nBut OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So OA\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169. And OI\u00b2 is 13, so IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2 - OI\u00b2 = 169 - 13 = 156. Therefore, IA = sqrt(156). Simplify that: sqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nSo IA is 2\u221a39. Hmm, but IA is the length from the inradius to vertex A. I remember that the inradius is related to the area and semiperimeter. Maybe I can find the sides of the triangle.\n\nWait, let me think about the formula for the length of the inradius. The inradius r = \u0394/s, where \u0394 is the area and s is the semiperimeter. So r = 6, so \u0394 = 6s.\n\nAlso, the circumradius R is given by R = (a b c)/(4\u0394), where a, b, c are the sides. Since R is 13, so 13 = (a b c)/(4\u0394). But \u0394 = 6s, so 13 = (a b c)/(4*6s) = (a b c)/(24s). Therefore, a b c = 13 * 24 s = 312 s.\n\nHmm, okay, so a b c = 312 s.\n\nBut I'm supposed to find AB * AC. Let's denote AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a. So I need to find b*c.\n\nMaybe I can relate IA with the sides. I remember that the length from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides. Let me recall the formula for IA.\n\nThe formula for IA is sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2), where s is the semiperimeter. Wait, is that correct? Let me think.\n\nYes, I think that's right. The inradius is r, and the distance from the incenter to vertex A is sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2). So IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nWe already found IA = 2\u221a39, so:\n\nsqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2) = 2\u221a39\nSquaring both sides: r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 = 4*39 = 156\nSince r = 6, r\u00b2 = 36. So:\n\n36 + (s - a)^2 = 156\n(s - a)^2 = 120\ns - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30)\nBut s is the semiperimeter, so s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nHmm, s - a = ( -a + b + c ) / 2 = (b + c - a)/2. So (b + c - a)/2 = 2\u221a30. Therefore, b + c - a = 4\u221a30.\n\nWait, but I also have other relationships. Maybe I can relate this to the area or something else.\n\nEarlier, I found that a b c = 312 s. Also, the area \u0394 = 6s.\n\nAnother formula I know is Heron's formula: \u0394 = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].\n\nBut since \u0394 = 6s, so 6s = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].\n\nSquare both sides: 36 s\u00b2 = s (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)\n\nDivide both sides by s (assuming s \u2260 0, which it isn't in a triangle):\n\n36 s = (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)\n\nHmm, that's one equation.\n\nBut I also have that (s - a) = 2\u221a30, from earlier. So s - a = 2\u221a30.\n\nSimilarly, I can write expressions for s - b and s - c. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, I don't know s - b or s - c yet. Maybe I can express them in terms of other variables.\n\nBut perhaps another approach. Let's recall that in any triangle, the product IA * IO = something. Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps using vectors or coordinate geometry.\n\nWait, maybe I can set up coordinate axes with O at the origin. Let me try that.\n\nLet me place the circumcenter O at (0, 0). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is the inradius, perhaps we can place I somewhere on the plane.\n\nWait, if O is at (0,0), and I is some point (h, k). Then vector OI is (h, k), and vector IA is from I to A, which is (A - I). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product is zero.\n\nSo (A - I) \u00b7 OI = 0.\n\nBut without knowing where A is, it's tricky. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities. Let's recall that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of angles.\n\nWait, another thought: in triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A is given by IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Wait, is that correct? Let me think.\n\nActually, the formula is IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)). Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, no, the formula is IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)) only in some specific cases? Or is it more general?\n\nWait, I think the formula is IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)). Hmm, if that's the case, then IA = 6 / sin(A/2) = 2\u221a39. So sin(A/2) = 6/(2\u221a39) = 3/\u221a39 = \u221a39/13. Wait, because \u221a39 is approx 6.245, but 3/\u221a39 is sqrt(39)/13? Let me compute that.\n\nWait, 3/\u221a39 = 3\u221a39 / 39 = \u221a39 /13. Yes, because 3 squared is 9, and 39 is 3*13. So 3/\u221a39 = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. Let me compute cos(A/2) using the identity sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 = 1.\n\nSo cos\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169. So cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nHmm, okay, so cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nNow, in a triangle, we have the formula for the sides in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter. Also, formulas involving the circumradius.\n\nWait, another formula: in any triangle, a = 2R sin A. So since R is 13, a = 2*13 sin A = 26 sin A.\n\nSimilarly, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSo if I can find sin A, I can find a, and then perhaps find other sides.\n\nBut how do I find sin A?\n\nWait, sin A can be expressed in terms of sin(A/2) and cos(A/2). Because sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2).\n\nSo sin A = 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = 2*sqrt(39*130)/169.\n\nCompute 39*130: 39*130 = (40 -1)*130 = 40*130 -130 = 5200 - 130 = 5070.\n\nSo sqrt(5070) = sqrt(10*507) = sqrt(10*3*13*13) = 13*sqrt(390). Wait, no, 5070 = 10 * 507, and 507 = 3*13\u00b2. So 5070 = 10*3*13\u00b2 = 30*13\u00b2. So sqrt(5070) = 13*sqrt(30).\n\nSo sin A = 2*(13*sqrt(30))/169 = (26 sqrt(30))/169 = (2 sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo sin A = (2 sqrt(30))/13.\n\nTherefore, side a = 26 sin A = 26*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo a = 4 sqrt(30). So BC = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nNow, since a = 4 sqrt(30), and R =13, and we have expressions for sin A, perhaps we can find other sides.\n\nWait, we also know that the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nAnd we have the area \u0394 = 6s.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed as \u0394 = (a b c)/(4R) = (a b c)/(52), since R =13.\n\nSo 6s = (a b c)/(52). So a b c = 6s * 52 = 312 s.\n\nBut earlier, I had a b c = 312 s as well, so that's consistent.\n\nBut we also have that a = 4 sqrt(30). So 4 sqrt(30) * b * c = 312 s.\n\nSo b c = (312 s)/(4 sqrt(30)) ) = (78 s)/sqrt(30) = (78 s sqrt(30))/30 = (13 s sqrt(30))/5.\n\nSo bc = (13 s sqrt(30))/5.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, I need to find bc, which is AB * AC.\n\nBut I need to find s in terms of the sides. So s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.\n\nBut from earlier, we had that (s - a) = 2 sqrt(30). Because (s - a) = (b + c -a)/2 = 2 sqrt(30).\n\nWait, so (b + c - a)/2 = 2 sqrt(30) => b + c - a = 4 sqrt(30). Since a is 4 sqrt(30), so:\n\nb + c - 4 sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30) => b + c = 8 sqrt(30).\n\nSo b + c = 8 sqrt(30). Therefore, s = (4 sqrt(30) + 8 sqrt(30))/2 = (12 sqrt(30))/2 = 6 sqrt(30).\n\nSo semiperimeter s = 6 sqrt(30).\n\nNow, going back to bc: bc = (13 s sqrt(30))/5 = (13 * 6 sqrt(30) * sqrt(30))/5.\n\nCompute sqrt(30)*sqrt(30) = 30. So:\n\nbc = (13 * 6 * 30)/5 = (13 * 6 * 6) = 13 * 36 = 468.\n\nWait, let me compute that step by step.\n\ns = 6 sqrt(30).\n\nSo bc = (13 * 6 sqrt(30) * sqrt(30)) / 5.\n\nsqrt(30)*sqrt(30) is 30, so:\n\nbc = (13 * 6 * 30) /5.\n\nCompute 13 *6=78.\n\n78 *30 = 2340.\n\n2340 /5 = 468.\n\nYes, so bc = 468.\n\nSo AB * AC = c * b = 468.\n\nWait, so is that the answer? 468.\n\nLet me check if all steps make sense.\n\nWe started with IA perpendicular to OI. Found OI using the formula OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Then used Pythagoras in triangle OIA to find IA.\n\nThen used the formula IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2) to find (s -a). From that, we found s -a = 2 sqrt(30), leading to b + c -a =4 sqrt(30).\n\nThen, using the fact that a =4 sqrt(30), we found b + c =8 sqrt(30).\n\nThen, using the formula for the area in two ways (\u0394 =6s and \u0394 =abc/(4R)), we connected the sides and found bc.\n\nSeems consistent. So the product AB * AC is 468.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC.\n\nHmm, let's start by recalling some properties of triangle centers. The circumradius R is 13, which is given. The inradius r is 6. The incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors.\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, that gives a right angle at I between IA and OI. Maybe I can use some coordinate geometry here. Or perhaps there are some known formulas that relate R, r, and other triangle properties when IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe I can use the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. There's a formula that says OI^2 = R(R - 2r). Let me check that.\n\nYes, the formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So plugging in the given values, OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13).\n\nBut wait, in this problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. So triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at I. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nBut OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So OA\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169. And OI\u00b2 is 13, so IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2 - OI\u00b2 = 169 - 13 = 156. Therefore, IA = sqrt(156). Simplify that: sqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nSo IA is 2\u221a39. Hmm, but IA is the length from the inradius to vertex A. I remember that the inradius is related to the area and semiperimeter. Maybe I can find the sides of the triangle.\n\nWait, let me think about the formula for the length of the inradius. The inradius r = \u0394/s, where \u0394 is the area and s is the semiperimeter. So r = 6, so \u0394 = 6s.\n\nAlso, the circumradius R is given by R = (a b c)/(4\u0394), where a, b, c are the sides. Since R is 13, so 13 = (a b c)/(4\u0394). But \u0394 = 6s, so 13 = (a b c)/(4*6s) = (a b c)/(24s). Therefore, a b c = 13 * 24 s = 312 s.\n\nHmm, okay, so a b c = 312 s.\n\nBut I'm supposed to find AB * AC. Let's denote AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a. So I need to find b*c.\n\nMaybe I can relate IA with the sides. I remember that the length from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides. Let me recall the formula for IA.\n\nThe formula for IA is sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2), where s is the semiperimeter. Wait, is that correct? Let me think.\n\nYes, I think that's right. The inradius is r, and the distance from the incenter to vertex A is sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2). So IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nWe already found IA = 2\u221a39, so:\n\nsqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2) = 2\u221a39\nSquaring both sides: r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 = 4*39 = 156\nSince r = 6, r\u00b2 = 36. So:\n\n36 + (s - a)^2 = 156\n(s - a)^2 = 120\ns - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30)\nBut s is the semiperimeter, so s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nHmm, s - a = ( -a + b + c ) / 2 = (b + c - a)/2. So (b + c - a)/2 = 2\u221a30. Therefore, b + c - a = 4\u221a30.\n\nWait, but I also have other relationships. Maybe I can relate this to the area or something else.\n\nEarlier, I found that a b c = 312 s. Also, the area \u0394 = 6s.\n\nAnother formula I know is Heron's formula: \u0394 = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].\n\nBut since \u0394 = 6s, so 6s = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].\n\nSquare both sides: 36 s\u00b2 = s (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)\n\nDivide both sides by s (assuming s \u2260 0, which it isn't in a triangle):\n\n36 s = (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)\n\nHmm, that's one equation.\n\nBut I also have that (s - a) = 2\u221a30, from earlier. So s - a = 2\u221a30.\n\nSimilarly, I can write expressions for s - b and s - c. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, I don't know s - b or s - c yet. Maybe I can express them in terms of other variables.\n\nBut perhaps another approach. Let's recall that in any triangle, the product IA * IO = something. Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps using vectors or coordinate geometry.\n\nWait, maybe I can set up coordinate axes with O at the origin. Let me try that.\n\nLet me place the circumcenter O at (0, 0). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is the inradius, perhaps we can place I somewhere on the plane.\n\nWait, if O is at (0,0), and I is some point (h, k). Then vector OI is (h, k), and vector IA is from I to A, which is (A - I). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product is zero.\n\nSo (A - I) \u00b7 OI = 0.\n\nBut without knowing where A is, it's tricky. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities. Let's recall that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of angles.\n\nWait, another thought: in triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A is given by IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Wait, is that correct? Let me think.\n\nActually, the formula is IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)). Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, no, the formula is IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)) only in some specific cases? Or is it more general?\n\nWait, I think the formula is IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)). Hmm, if that's the case, then IA = 6 / sin(A/2) = 2\u221a39. So sin(A/2) = 6/(2\u221a39) = 3/\u221a39 = \u221a39/13. Wait, because \u221a39 is approx 6.245, but 3/\u221a39 is sqrt(39)/13? Let me compute that.\n\nWait, 3/\u221a39 = 3\u221a39 / 39 = \u221a39 /13. Yes, because 3 squared is 9, and 39 is 3*13. So 3/\u221a39 = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. Let me compute cos(A/2) using the identity sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 = 1.\n\nSo cos\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169. So cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nHmm, okay, so cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nNow, in a triangle, we have the formula for the sides in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter. Also, formulas involving the circumradius.\n\nWait, another formula: in any triangle, a = 2R sin A. So since R is 13, a = 2*13 sin A = 26 sin A.\n\nSimilarly, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSo if I can find sin A, I can find a, and then perhaps find other sides.\n\nBut how do I find sin A?\n\nWait, sin A can be expressed in terms of sin(A/2) and cos(A/2). Because sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2).\n\nSo sin A = 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = 2*sqrt(39*130)/169.\n\nCompute 39*130: 39*130 = (40 -1)*130 = 40*130 -130 = 5200 - 130 = 5070.\n\nSo sqrt(5070) = sqrt(10*507) = sqrt(10*3*13*13) = 13*sqrt(390). Wait, no, 5070 = 10 * 507, and 507 = 3*13\u00b2. So 5070 = 10*3*13\u00b2 = 30*13\u00b2. So sqrt(5070) = 13*sqrt(30).\n\nSo sin A = 2*(13*sqrt(30))/169 = (26 sqrt(30))/169 = (2 sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo sin A = (2 sqrt(30))/13.\n\nTherefore, side a = 26 sin A = 26*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo a = 4 sqrt(30). So BC = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nNow, since a = 4 sqrt(30), and R =13, and we have expressions for sin A, perhaps we can find other sides.\n\nWait, we also know that the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nAnd we have the area \u0394 = 6s.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed as \u0394 = (a b c)/(4R) = (a b c)/(52), since R =13.\n\nSo 6s = (a b c)/(52). So a b c = 6s * 52 = 312 s.\n\nBut earlier, I had a b c = 312 s as well, so that's consistent.\n\nBut we also have that a = 4 sqrt(30). So 4 sqrt(30) * b * c = 312 s.\n\nSo b c = (312 s)/(4 sqrt(30)) ) = (78 s)/sqrt(30) = (78 s sqrt(30))/30 = (13 s sqrt(30))/5.\n\nSo bc = (13 s sqrt(30))/5.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, I need to find bc, which is AB * AC.\n\nBut I need to find s in terms of the sides. So s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.\n\nBut from earlier, we had that (s - a) = 2 sqrt(30). Because (s - a) = (b + c -a)/2 = 2 sqrt(30).\n\nWait, so (b + c - a)/2 = 2 sqrt(30) => b + c - a = 4 sqrt(30). Since a is 4 sqrt(30), so:\n\nb + c - 4 sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30) => b + c = 8 sqrt(30).\n\nSo b + c = 8 sqrt(30). Therefore, s = (4 sqrt(30) + 8 sqrt(30))/2 = (12 sqrt(30))/2 = 6 sqrt(30).\n\nSo semiperimeter s = 6 sqrt(30).\n\nNow, going back to bc: bc = (13 s sqrt(30))/5 = (13 * 6 sqrt(30) * sqrt(30))/5.\n\nCompute sqrt(30)*sqrt(30) = 30. So:\n\nbc = (13 * 6 * 30)/5 = (13 * 6 * 6) = 13 * 36 = 468.\n\nWait, let me compute that step by step.\n\ns = 6 sqrt(30).\n\nSo bc = (13 * 6 sqrt(30) * sqrt(30)) / 5.\n\nsqrt(30)*sqrt(30) is 30, so:\n\nbc = (13 * 6 * 30) /5.\n\nCompute 13 *6=78.\n\n78 *30 = 2340.\n\n2340 /5 = 468.\n\nYes, so bc = 468.\n\nSo AB * AC = c * b = 468.\n\nWait, so is that the answer? 468.\n\nLet me check if all steps make sense.\n\nWe started with IA perpendicular to OI. Found OI using the formula OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Then used Pythagoras in triangle OIA to find IA.\n\nThen used the formula IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2) to find (s -a). From that, we found s -a = 2 sqrt(30), leading to b + c -a =4 sqrt(30).\n\nThen, using the fact that a =4 sqrt(30), we found b + c =8 sqrt(30).\n\nThen, using the formula for the area in two ways (\u0394 =6s and \u0394 =abc/(4R)), we connected the sides and found bc.\n\nSeems consistent. So the product AB * AC is 468.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the circumradius \\( R = 13 \\) and the inradius \\( r = 6 \\). The distance between the circumcenter \\( O \\) and the incenter \\( I \\) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nOI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr = 13^2 - 2 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 6 = 169 - 156 = 13 \\implies OI = \\sqrt{13}.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\), triangle \\( OIA \\) is a right triangle at \\( I \\). Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\nOA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \\implies 13^2 = (\\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \\implies 169 = 13 + IA^2 \\implies IA^2 = 156 \\implies IA = \\sqrt{156} = 2\\sqrt{39}.\n\\]\n\nThe length \\( IA \\) can also be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nIA = \\sqrt{r^2 + (s - a)^2},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( s \\) is the semiperimeter and \\( a \\) is the side opposite vertex \\( A \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the parts.\n\nWe have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It says that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nHmm, okay. So, triangle ABC, with O as the circumcenter and I as the incenter. IA is perpendicular to OI, so the line from I to A is perpendicular to the line from O to I. Interesting. I know that in a triangle, the circumradius R is 13, and the inradius r is 6.\n\nI need to find AB multiplied by AC. So, I need to figure out a way to relate these lengths with the given information.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of triangle centers. The circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle. The formula for the circumradius is R = (a b c) / (4 \u0394), where a, b, c are the sides, and \u0394 is the area.\n\nThe inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter. The formula is r = \u0394 / s, where s is the semiperimeter, (a + b + c)/2.\n\nGiven that IA is perpendicular to OI, that seems like a key condition. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry? Or perhaps vector methods? Or maybe there's a property or theorem related to this condition.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider coordinate geometry here. Let me try setting up a coordinate system where point I is at the origin. That might simplify things since we can then express vectors more easily.\n\nBut before I get into coordinate geometry, maybe I should explore some relationships between the inradius, circumradius, and other elements.\n\nI remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r)\n\nIs that correct? Let me verify. Yes, I think that's right. So, OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). So, OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)).\n\nGiven that R is 13 and r is 6, let's compute OI.\n\nOI\u00b2 = 13(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13.\n\nSo OI = sqrt(13).\n\nWait, but IA is perpendicular to OI. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is the incenter, O is the circumcenter.\n\nLet me think about the vector representation. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular. So, their dot product is zero.\n\nLet me denote vectors with their position vectors. Let me place point I at the origin to make it easier. So, I is at (0,0). Then, O is at some point, say vector O. Point A is at some vector A.\n\nSince IA is the vector from I to A, which is just vector A. OI is the vector from O to I, which is -O (since I is at origin).\n\nWait, but IA is from I to A, so it's vector A - I, which is A - (0,0) = A. OI is from O to I, which is I - O = (0,0) - O = -O.\n\nWait, but in the problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, IA is vector A, and OI is vector -O. So, their dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, A \u00b7 (-O) = 0 \u2192 A \u00b7 O = 0.\n\nSo, the position vectors of A and O are perpendicular.\n\nHmm, that's a useful condition. So, in this coordinate system where I is the origin, the vectors A and O are perpendicular.\n\nSo, OA is perpendicular to IA. Wait, but OA is the circumradius vector, right? Because O is the circumcenter. So, OA is the vector from O to A, which is A - O.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, O is the circumcenter, so OA is the radius, which has length R = 13.\n\nBut in our coordinate system, O is at some point, and A is another point.\n\nWait, maybe this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to structure this.\n\nLet me set up the coordinate system with I at (0,0). Then, O is at some point (h, k). Point A is at (x, y). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and IA is the vector from I to A, which is (x, y). OI is the vector from O to I, which is (-h, -k). So, their dot product is zero:\n\nx*(-h) + y*(-k) = 0 \u2192 -h x - k y = 0 \u2192 h x + k y = 0.\n\nSo, h x + k y = 0.\n\nAlso, OA is the distance from O to A, which is sqrt((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2) = R = 13.\n\nAnd since O is the circumradius, the distance from O to A is 13.\n\nAlso, I is the inradius, so the distance from I to A is the inradius? Wait, no. Wait, the inradius is the distance from I to any side, not from I to the vertex. So, IA is not equal to the inradius. The inradius is the distance from I to BC, not to A.\n\nSo, IA is not the inradius, but the length from incenter to vertex A. That's a different length.\n\nHmm, so IA is a segment from incenter to vertex, and it's perpendicular to OI.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's parameters. Let me recall that formula.\n\nThe distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by:\n\nIA = sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2),\n\nwhere r is the inradius, s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A, which is BC.\n\nAlternatively, I think the formula is IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Let me check.\n\nYes, I think the formula is IA = r / sin(A/2). Similarly, IB = r / sin(B/2), and IC = r / sin(C/2).\n\nSo, IA = r / sin(A/2). Since r is 6, IA = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, I think that in triangle ABC, the distance from the inradius to vertex A is sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nSo, IA^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nHmm, that might be helpful.\n\nSo, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in our coordinate system, IA is vector A, which is (x, y), and OI is vector (-h, -k). Their dot product is zero: x*(-h) + y*(-k) = 0 \u2192 h x + k y = 0.\n\nAlso, the distance from O to A is 13, so (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = 13^2 = 169.\n\nAdditionally, since I is the incenter, its coordinates are (0,0), and in a coordinate system with I at the origin, the inradius is 6, which is the distance from I to any side.\n\nBut maybe that's not directly helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider some properties of triangle ABC, given that IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nWait, I found earlier that OI^2 = R(R - 2r). So, OI = sqrt(13). That's an important value.\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is sqrt(13), perhaps we can consider the right triangle formed by points I, A, and the foot of the perpendicular from A to OI.\n\nWait, but I is the inradius, so maybe that's not directly helpful.\n\nWait, but in our coordinate system, IA is vector (x, y), OI is vector (-h, -k), and their dot product is zero. So, h x + k y = 0.\n\nAlso, the distance OA is 13: (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = 169.\n\nBut since I is the inradius, the distance from I to the sides is 6.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to find some relations between the sides a, b, c, semiperimeter s, area \u0394, inradius r, and circumradius R.\n\nGiven that R = 13, r = 6.\n\nWe know that R = (a b c) / (4 \u0394), and r = \u0394 / s, where s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, perhaps I can relate these.\n\nWe also have the formula OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2 R r.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nWait, earlier I thought OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). Let me verify.\n\nYes, the formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2 R r.\n\nSo, substituting R =13, r =6:\n\nOI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13.\n\nSo, OI = sqrt(13), as we had before.\n\nSo, the distance between O and I is sqrt(13).\n\nNow, in the coordinate system where I is at (0,0), O is at (h, k), with h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 = 13.\n\nSo, O is at (h, k) such that h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 =13.\n\nPoint A is at (x, y), with (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 =169.\n\nAnd the dot product of IA and OI is zero: h x + k y =0.\n\nSo, h x + k y =0.\n\nSo, we have these equations:\n\n1. h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 =13.\n\n2. (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 =169.\n\n3. h x + k y =0.\n\nBut this seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can find another relationship involving x and y.\n\nWait, since I is the inradius, which is at (0,0), and in a triangle, the inradius is located at coordinates determined by the sides.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express the sides in terms of the semiperimeter s, and use the formulae for the distances.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the coordinates of A, B, C in terms of the triangle's properties.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use barycentric coordinates or something else, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the fact that the area \u0394 is related to both R and r.\n\nWe have \u0394 = (a b c)/(4 R) = (a b c)/(4*13) = (a b c)/52.\n\nAlso, \u0394 = r s, where s is the semiperimeter, so \u0394 =6 s.\n\nSo, (a b c)/52 =6 s \u2192 a b c = 312 s.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's immediately helpful.\n\nWe need to find AB \u00b7 AC, which is c \u00b7 b, if we denote sides as a, b, c opposite to angles A, B, C.\n\nWait, AB is the side opposite to C, which is c, and AC is the side opposite to B, which is b. So, AB \u00b7 AC = b c.\n\nSo, we need to find b c.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nSo, perhaps if I can find expressions involving b and c, I can find their product.\n\nGiven that, let me think about the formulae.\n\nI know that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the area and the sine of the included angle.\n\nBut without knowing the angles, that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the distance from the inradius to the vertex.\n\nEarlier, I thought that IA = r / sin(A/2). So, IA = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nBut IA is also a length from I to A, which in our coordinate system is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nSo, sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nHmm, but I don't know angle A yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find sin(A/2) in terms of the triangle's parameters.\n\nWait, I know that sin(A/2) = sqrt( (s - b)(s - c) / (b c) ).\n\nYes, that's a standard formula. So, sin(A/2) = sqrt( (s - b)(s - c) / (b c) ).\n\nSo, IA = 6 / sqrt( (s - b)(s - c) / (b c) ) = 6 * sqrt( b c / ( (s - b)(s - c) ) ).\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find another relation.\n\nWait, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and in our coordinate system, IA is (x, y) and OI is (-h, -k), their dot product is zero: h x + k y =0.\n\nSo, h x = -k y.\n\nFrom this, h / k = - y / x.\n\nSo, the ratio of h to k is equal to the negative ratio of y to x.\n\nSo, h = (- y / x) * k.\n\nBut since h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 =13, substituting h:\n\n( (- y / x * k ) )\u00b2 + k\u00b2 =13 \u2192 ( y\u00b2 / x\u00b2 ) k\u00b2 + k\u00b2 =13 \u2192 k\u00b2 ( y\u00b2 / x\u00b2 +1 ) =13.\n\nSo, k\u00b2 ( (y\u00b2 + x\u00b2 ) / x\u00b2 ) =13 \u2192 k\u00b2 ( (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 ) / x\u00b2 ) =13.\n\nBut x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 is the square of IA, which is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = IA = 6 / sin(A/2). Wait, but we don't know IA yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find another equation.\n\nWe have (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 =169.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2 h x + h\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2 k y + k\u00b2 =169.\n\nBut from the dot product condition, h x + k y =0, so 2 h x + 2 k y =0.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2 (h x + k y) + h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2) =169.\n\nBut h\u00b2 + k\u00b2=13, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +13 =169 \u2192 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=156.\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 =156. So, IA = sqrt(156) = 2 sqrt(39).\n\nWait, but IA was also equal to 6 / sin(A/2). So, 6 / sin(A/2) = sqrt(156).\n\nThus, sin(A/2) =6 / sqrt(156) =6 / (2 sqrt(39)) )= 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13 *3? Wait, let me compute.\n\nWait, sqrt(156) is sqrt(4*39)=2 sqrt(39). So, IA = 2 sqrt(39).\n\nSo, IA = 2 sqrt(39) =6 / sin(A/2).\n\nSo, sin(A/2) =6 / (2 sqrt(39))=3 / sqrt(39)= (3 sqrt(39)) /39= sqrt(39)/13.\n\nWait, because 3/sqrt(39) can be rationalized as (3 sqrt(39)) /39= sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13.\n\nHmm, that's an important value. Let me note that down.\n\nSo, sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13.\n\nNow, I can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8=1.\n\nSo, cos\u00b2(A/2)=1 - (39/169)= (169-39)/169=130/169.\n\nSo, cos(A/2)=sqrt(130)/13. (Assuming angle A is acute, which it probably is.)\n\nNow, from trigonometric identities, sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2).\n\nSo, sin A =2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13)=2*sqrt(39*130)/169.\n\nLet me compute 39*130.\n\n39*130= (40-1)*130=40*130 -130=5200 -130=5070.\n\nSo, sin A=2*sqrt(5070)/169.\n\nWait, sqrt(5070). Let me see if 5070 can be simplified.\n\n5070 divided by 10 is 507. 507 divided by 3 is 169. So, 5070=10*3*169=30*13\u00b2.\n\nSo, sqrt(5070)=sqrt(30*13\u00b2)=13 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, sin A=2*(13 sqrt(30))/169= (26 sqrt(30))/169= (2 sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nNow, using the formula for the area of the triangle, \u0394= (1/2)ab sin C. Wait, in our case, for angle A, it's \u0394=(1/2) b c sin A.\n\nWe also know that \u0394= r s=6 s, and \u0394= (a b c)/(4 R)= (a b c)/52.\n\nSo, 6 s= (a b c)/52 \u2192 a b c=312 s.\n\nBut we need to find b c, which is AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nLet me denote b c as X. Then, a b c= a X =312 s.\n\nHmm, but I don't know a.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find another equation involving b and c.\n\nWait, let's recall that in a triangle, the sides are related to the semiperimeter and the inradius.\n\nWe have r=\u0394/s=6, so \u0394=6 s.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed using the formula \u0394= (1/2) b c sin A.\n\nSo, 6 s= (1/2) b c sin A \u2192 12 s= b c sin A.\n\nWe have sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13, so:\n\n12 s= b c * (2 sqrt(30)/13) \u2192 b c= (12 s *13)/(2 sqrt(30))= (6 s *13)/sqrt(30)= (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, but I don't know s yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express s in terms of other variables.\n\nWait, s= (a + b + c)/2.\n\nBut I don't know a, b, c.\n\nHmm. Maybe I can find a relation between a, b, c using the fact that IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nWait, earlier, I had that IA\u00b2=156.\n\nAnd IA\u00b2=156= (distance from I to A)^2.\n\nBut in a triangle, IA\u00b2= r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nSo, IA\u00b2= r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2=6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2=36 + (s -a)^2=156.\n\nSo, (s -a)^2=156 -36=120.\n\nSo, s -a= sqrt(120)=2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s -a=2 sqrt(30).\n\nBut s= (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, (a + b + c)/2 -a= ( -a + b + c )/2= (b + c -a)/2=2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, (b + c -a)/2=2 sqrt(30) \u2192 b + c -a=4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, equation (1): b + c -a=4 sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, that's one equation involving a, b, c.\n\nAnother equation is from the Law of Sines: a=2 R sin A=2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13)=2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13)=2*2 sqrt(30)=4 sqrt(30).\n\nWait, wait, Law of Sines says a=2 R sin A.\n\nSo, a=2 *13 * (2 sqrt(30)/13)= (26)*(2 sqrt(30)/13)= (26/13)*2 sqrt(30)=2 *2 sqrt(30)=4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, a=4 sqrt(30).\n\nThen, from equation (1): b + c -a=4 sqrt(30) \u2192 b + c -4 sqrt(30)=4 sqrt(30) \u2192 b + c=8 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, b + c=8 sqrt(30).\n\nNow, that's another equation.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n1. a=4 sqrt(30).\n\n2. b + c=8 sqrt(30).\n\nWe need to find b c.\n\nHmm, so we have two equations:\n\nFrom the area, we had:\n\n\u0394=6 s= (1/2) b c sin A.\n\nWe have sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, 6 s= (1/2) b c (2 sqrt(30)/13)= (b c sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, 6 s= (b c sqrt(30))/13.\n\nBut s= (a + b + c)/2= (4 sqrt(30) +8 sqrt(30))/2= (12 sqrt(30))/2=6 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s=6 sqrt(30).\n\nThus, substituting into 6 s= (b c sqrt(30))/13:\n\n6 *6 sqrt(30)= (b c sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, 36 sqrt(30)= (b c sqrt(30))/13.\n\nMultiply both sides by 13:\n\n36*13 sqrt(30)=b c sqrt(30).\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(30):\n\n36*13= b c.\n\nSo, b c= 36*13=468.\n\nSo, AB \u00b7 AC= b c=468.\n\nWait, so is that the answer? Let me check my steps.\n\n1. Found OI\u00b2=13.\n\n2. Set up coordinate system with I at origin.\n\n3. Derived equations based on perpendicularity and distances.\n\n4. Found IA\u00b2=156.\n\n5. Expressed IA\u00b2 in terms of r and s -a, leading to s -a=2 sqrt(30).\n\n6. Used Law of Sines to find a=4 sqrt(30).\n\n7. Found b + c=8 sqrt(30).\n\n8. Calculated semiperimeter s=6 sqrt(30).\n\n9. Used area formula to find b c=468.\n\nThis seems consistent. So, the product AB \u00b7 AC is 468.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the parts.\n\nWe have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It says that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nHmm, okay. So, triangle ABC, with O as the circumcenter and I as the incenter. IA is perpendicular to OI, so the line from I to A is perpendicular to the line from O to I. Interesting. I know that in a triangle, the circumradius R is 13, and the inradius r is 6.\n\nI need to find AB multiplied by AC. So, I need to figure out a way to relate these lengths with the given information.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of triangle centers. The circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle. The formula for the circumradius is R = (a b c) / (4 \u0394), where a, b, c are the sides, and \u0394 is the area.\n\nThe inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter. The formula is r = \u0394 / s, where s is the semiperimeter, (a + b + c)/2.\n\nGiven that IA is perpendicular to OI, that seems like a key condition. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry? Or perhaps vector methods? Or maybe there's a property or theorem related to this condition.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider coordinate geometry here. Let me try setting up a coordinate system where point I is at the origin. That might simplify things since we can then express vectors more easily.\n\nBut before I get into coordinate geometry, maybe I should explore some relationships between the inradius, circumradius, and other elements.\n\nI remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r)\n\nIs that correct? Let me verify. Yes, I think that's right. So, OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). So, OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)).\n\nGiven that R is 13 and r is 6, let's compute OI.\n\nOI\u00b2 = 13(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13.\n\nSo OI = sqrt(13).\n\nWait, but IA is perpendicular to OI. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is the incenter, O is the circumcenter.\n\nLet me think about the vector representation. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular. So, their dot product is zero.\n\nLet me denote vectors with their position vectors. Let me place point I at the origin to make it easier. So, I is at (0,0). Then, O is at some point, say vector O. Point A is at some vector A.\n\nSince IA is the vector from I to A, which is just vector A. OI is the vector from O to I, which is -O (since I is at origin).\n\nWait, but IA is from I to A, so it's vector A - I, which is A - (0,0) = A. OI is from O to I, which is I - O = (0,0) - O = -O.\n\nWait, but in the problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, IA is vector A, and OI is vector -O. So, their dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, A \u00b7 (-O) = 0 \u2192 A \u00b7 O = 0.\n\nSo, the position vectors of A and O are perpendicular.\n\nHmm, that's a useful condition. So, in this coordinate system where I is the origin, the vectors A and O are perpendicular.\n\nSo, OA is perpendicular to IA. Wait, but OA is the circumradius vector, right? Because O is the circumcenter. So, OA is the vector from O to A, which is A - O.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, O is the circumcenter, so OA is the radius, which has length R = 13.\n\nBut in our coordinate system, O is at some point, and A is another point.\n\nWait, maybe this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to structure this.\n\nLet me set up the coordinate system with I at (0,0). Then, O is at some point (h, k). Point A is at (x, y). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and IA is the vector from I to A, which is (x, y). OI is the vector from O to I, which is (-h, -k). So, their dot product is zero:\n\nx*(-h) + y*(-k) = 0 \u2192 -h x - k y = 0 \u2192 h x + k y = 0.\n\nSo, h x + k y = 0.\n\nAlso, OA is the distance from O to A, which is sqrt((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2) = R = 13.\n\nAnd since O is the circumradius, the distance from O to A is 13.\n\nAlso, I is the inradius, so the distance from I to A is the inradius? Wait, no. Wait, the inradius is the distance from I to any side, not from I to the vertex. So, IA is not equal to the inradius. The inradius is the distance from I to BC, not to A.\n\nSo, IA is not the inradius, but the length from incenter to vertex A. That's a different length.\n\nHmm, so IA is a segment from incenter to vertex, and it's perpendicular to OI.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's parameters. Let me recall that formula.\n\nThe distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by:\n\nIA = sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2),\n\nwhere r is the inradius, s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A, which is BC.\n\nAlternatively, I think the formula is IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Let me check.\n\nYes, I think the formula is IA = r / sin(A/2). Similarly, IB = r / sin(B/2), and IC = r / sin(C/2).\n\nSo, IA = r / sin(A/2). Since r is 6, IA = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, I think that in triangle ABC, the distance from the inradius to vertex A is sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nSo, IA^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nHmm, that might be helpful.\n\nSo, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in our coordinate system, IA is vector A, which is (x, y), and OI is vector (-h, -k). Their dot product is zero: x*(-h) + y*(-k) = 0 \u2192 h x + k y = 0.\n\nAlso, the distance from O to A is 13, so (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = 13^2 = 169.\n\nAdditionally, since I is the incenter, its coordinates are (0,0), and in a coordinate system with I at the origin, the inradius is 6, which is the distance from I to any side.\n\nBut maybe that's not directly helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider some properties of triangle ABC, given that IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nWait, I found earlier that OI^2 = R(R - 2r). So, OI = sqrt(13). That's an important value.\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is sqrt(13), perhaps we can consider the right triangle formed by points I, A, and the foot of the perpendicular from A to OI.\n\nWait, but I is the inradius, so maybe that's not directly helpful.\n\nWait, but in our coordinate system, IA is vector (x, y), OI is vector (-h, -k), and their dot product is zero. So, h x + k y = 0.\n\nAlso, the distance OA is 13: (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = 169.\n\nBut since I is the inradius, the distance from I to the sides is 6.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to find some relations between the sides a, b, c, semiperimeter s, area \u0394, inradius r, and circumradius R.\n\nGiven that R = 13, r = 6.\n\nWe know that R = (a b c) / (4 \u0394), and r = \u0394 / s, where s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, perhaps I can relate these.\n\nWe also have the formula OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2 R r.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nWait, earlier I thought OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). Let me verify.\n\nYes, the formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2 R r.\n\nSo, substituting R =13, r =6:\n\nOI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13.\n\nSo, OI = sqrt(13), as we had before.\n\nSo, the distance between O and I is sqrt(13).\n\nNow, in the coordinate system where I is at (0,0), O is at (h, k), with h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 = 13.\n\nSo, O is at (h, k) such that h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 =13.\n\nPoint A is at (x, y), with (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 =169.\n\nAnd the dot product of IA and OI is zero: h x + k y =0.\n\nSo, h x + k y =0.\n\nSo, we have these equations:\n\n1. h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 =13.\n\n2. (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 =169.\n\n3. h x + k y =0.\n\nBut this seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can find another relationship involving x and y.\n\nWait, since I is the inradius, which is at (0,0), and in a triangle, the inradius is located at coordinates determined by the sides.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express the sides in terms of the semiperimeter s, and use the formulae for the distances.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the coordinates of A, B, C in terms of the triangle's properties.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use barycentric coordinates or something else, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the fact that the area \u0394 is related to both R and r.\n\nWe have \u0394 = (a b c)/(4 R) = (a b c)/(4*13) = (a b c)/52.\n\nAlso, \u0394 = r s, where s is the semiperimeter, so \u0394 =6 s.\n\nSo, (a b c)/52 =6 s \u2192 a b c = 312 s.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's immediately helpful.\n\nWe need to find AB \u00b7 AC, which is c \u00b7 b, if we denote sides as a, b, c opposite to angles A, B, C.\n\nWait, AB is the side opposite to C, which is c, and AC is the side opposite to B, which is b. So, AB \u00b7 AC = b c.\n\nSo, we need to find b c.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nSo, perhaps if I can find expressions involving b and c, I can find their product.\n\nGiven that, let me think about the formulae.\n\nI know that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the area and the sine of the included angle.\n\nBut without knowing the angles, that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the distance from the inradius to the vertex.\n\nEarlier, I thought that IA = r / sin(A/2). So, IA = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nBut IA is also a length from I to A, which in our coordinate system is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nSo, sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nHmm, but I don't know angle A yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find sin(A/2) in terms of the triangle's parameters.\n\nWait, I know that sin(A/2) = sqrt( (s - b)(s - c) / (b c) ).\n\nYes, that's a standard formula. So, sin(A/2) = sqrt( (s - b)(s - c) / (b c) ).\n\nSo, IA = 6 / sqrt( (s - b)(s - c) / (b c) ) = 6 * sqrt( b c / ( (s - b)(s - c) ) ).\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find another relation.\n\nWait, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and in our coordinate system, IA is (x, y) and OI is (-h, -k), their dot product is zero: h x + k y =0.\n\nSo, h x = -k y.\n\nFrom this, h / k = - y / x.\n\nSo, the ratio of h to k is equal to the negative ratio of y to x.\n\nSo, h = (- y / x) * k.\n\nBut since h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 =13, substituting h:\n\n( (- y / x * k ) )\u00b2 + k\u00b2 =13 \u2192 ( y\u00b2 / x\u00b2 ) k\u00b2 + k\u00b2 =13 \u2192 k\u00b2 ( y\u00b2 / x\u00b2 +1 ) =13.\n\nSo, k\u00b2 ( (y\u00b2 + x\u00b2 ) / x\u00b2 ) =13 \u2192 k\u00b2 ( (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 ) / x\u00b2 ) =13.\n\nBut x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 is the square of IA, which is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = IA = 6 / sin(A/2). Wait, but we don't know IA yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find another equation.\n\nWe have (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 =169.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2 h x + h\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2 k y + k\u00b2 =169.\n\nBut from the dot product condition, h x + k y =0, so 2 h x + 2 k y =0.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2 (h x + k y) + h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2) =169.\n\nBut h\u00b2 + k\u00b2=13, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +13 =169 \u2192 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=156.\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 =156. So, IA = sqrt(156) = 2 sqrt(39).\n\nWait, but IA was also equal to 6 / sin(A/2). So, 6 / sin(A/2) = sqrt(156).\n\nThus, sin(A/2) =6 / sqrt(156) =6 / (2 sqrt(39)) )= 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13 *3? Wait, let me compute.\n\nWait, sqrt(156) is sqrt(4*39)=2 sqrt(39). So, IA = 2 sqrt(39).\n\nSo, IA = 2 sqrt(39) =6 / sin(A/2).\n\nSo, sin(A/2) =6 / (2 sqrt(39))=3 / sqrt(39)= (3 sqrt(39)) /39= sqrt(39)/13.\n\nWait, because 3/sqrt(39) can be rationalized as (3 sqrt(39)) /39= sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13.\n\nHmm, that's an important value. Let me note that down.\n\nSo, sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13.\n\nNow, I can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8=1.\n\nSo, cos\u00b2(A/2)=1 - (39/169)= (169-39)/169=130/169.\n\nSo, cos(A/2)=sqrt(130)/13. (Assuming angle A is acute, which it probably is.)\n\nNow, from trigonometric identities, sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2).\n\nSo, sin A =2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13)=2*sqrt(39*130)/169.\n\nLet me compute 39*130.\n\n39*130= (40-1)*130=40*130 -130=5200 -130=5070.\n\nSo, sin A=2*sqrt(5070)/169.\n\nWait, sqrt(5070). Let me see if 5070 can be simplified.\n\n5070 divided by 10 is 507. 507 divided by 3 is 169. So, 5070=10*3*169=30*13\u00b2.\n\nSo, sqrt(5070)=sqrt(30*13\u00b2)=13 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, sin A=2*(13 sqrt(30))/169= (26 sqrt(30))/169= (2 sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nNow, using the formula for the area of the triangle, \u0394= (1/2)ab sin C. Wait, in our case, for angle A, it's \u0394=(1/2) b c sin A.\n\nWe also know that \u0394= r s=6 s, and \u0394= (a b c)/(4 R)= (a b c)/52.\n\nSo, 6 s= (a b c)/52 \u2192 a b c=312 s.\n\nBut we need to find b c, which is AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nLet me denote b c as X. Then, a b c= a X =312 s.\n\nHmm, but I don't know a.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find another equation involving b and c.\n\nWait, let's recall that in a triangle, the sides are related to the semiperimeter and the inradius.\n\nWe have r=\u0394/s=6, so \u0394=6 s.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed using the formula \u0394= (1/2) b c sin A.\n\nSo, 6 s= (1/2) b c sin A \u2192 12 s= b c sin A.\n\nWe have sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13, so:\n\n12 s= b c * (2 sqrt(30)/13) \u2192 b c= (12 s *13)/(2 sqrt(30))= (6 s *13)/sqrt(30)= (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, but I don't know s yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express s in terms of other variables.\n\nWait, s= (a + b + c)/2.\n\nBut I don't know a, b, c.\n\nHmm. Maybe I can find a relation between a, b, c using the fact that IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nWait, earlier, I had that IA\u00b2=156.\n\nAnd IA\u00b2=156= (distance from I to A)^2.\n\nBut in a triangle, IA\u00b2= r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nSo, IA\u00b2= r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2=6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2=36 + (s -a)^2=156.\n\nSo, (s -a)^2=156 -36=120.\n\nSo, s -a= sqrt(120)=2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s -a=2 sqrt(30).\n\nBut s= (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, (a + b + c)/2 -a= ( -a + b + c )/2= (b + c -a)/2=2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, (b + c -a)/2=2 sqrt(30) \u2192 b + c -a=4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, equation (1): b + c -a=4 sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, that's one equation involving a, b, c.\n\nAnother equation is from the Law of Sines: a=2 R sin A=2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13)=2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13)=2*2 sqrt(30)=4 sqrt(30).\n\nWait, wait, Law of Sines says a=2 R sin A.\n\nSo, a=2 *13 * (2 sqrt(30)/13)= (26)*(2 sqrt(30)/13)= (26/13)*2 sqrt(30)=2 *2 sqrt(30)=4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, a=4 sqrt(30).\n\nThen, from equation (1): b + c -a=4 sqrt(30) \u2192 b + c -4 sqrt(30)=4 sqrt(30) \u2192 b + c=8 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, b + c=8 sqrt(30).\n\nNow, that's another equation.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n1. a=4 sqrt(30).\n\n2. b + c=8 sqrt(30).\n\nWe need to find b c.\n\nHmm, so we have two equations:\n\nFrom the area, we had:\n\n\u0394=6 s= (1/2) b c sin A.\n\nWe have sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, 6 s= (1/2) b c (2 sqrt(30)/13)= (b c sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, 6 s= (b c sqrt(30))/13.\n\nBut s= (a + b + c)/2= (4 sqrt(30) +8 sqrt(30))/2= (12 sqrt(30))/2=6 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s=6 sqrt(30).\n\nThus, substituting into 6 s= (b c sqrt(30))/13:\n\n6 *6 sqrt(30)= (b c sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, 36 sqrt(30)= (b c sqrt(30))/13.\n\nMultiply both sides by 13:\n\n36*13 sqrt(30)=b c sqrt(30).\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(30):\n\n36*13= b c.\n\nSo, b c= 36*13=468.\n\nSo, AB \u00b7 AC= b c=468.\n\nWait, so is that the answer? Let me check my steps.\n\n1. Found OI\u00b2=13.\n\n2. Set up coordinate system with I at origin.\n\n3. Derived equations based on perpendicularity and distances.\n\n4. Found IA\u00b2=156.\n\n5. Expressed IA\u00b2 in terms of r and s -a, leading to s -a=2 sqrt(30).\n\n6. Used Law of Sines to find a=4 sqrt(30).\n\n7. Found b + c=8 sqrt(30).\n\n8. Calculated semiperimeter s=6 sqrt(30).\n\n9. Used area formula to find b c=468.\n\nThis seems consistent. So, the product AB \u00b7 AC is 468.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting the given conditions: triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) has circumradius \\( R = 13 \\), inradius \\( r = 6 \\), and \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\). We aim to find \\( AB \\cdot AC \\).\n\n1. **Distance between Incenter and Circumcenter**:\n   Using the formula \\( OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \\), we find:\n   \\[\n   OI^2 = 13(13 - 12) = 13 \\implies OI = \\sqrt{13}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Perpendicular Condition**:\n   Since \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\), the vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{IA} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{OI} \\) are perpendicular. In a coordinate system with \\( I \\) at the origin, this implies \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{O} = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Length of \\( IA \\)**:\n   Using the formula \\( IA^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2 \\), where \\( s \\) is the semiperimeter and \\( a \\) is the side opposite \\( A \\), we find:\n   \\[\n   IA^2 = 6^2 + (s - a)^2 = 36 + (s - a)^2.\n   \\]\n   From the coordinate system, \\( IA^2 = x^2 + y^2 = 156 \\), so:\n   \\[\n   36 + (s - a)^2 = 156 \\implies (s - a)^2 = 120 \\implies s - a = 2\\sqrt{30}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Law of Sines**:\n   Using \\( a = 2R \\sin A \\) and knowing \\( \\sin A = \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13} \\), we find:\n   \\[\n   a = 2 \\cdot 13 \\cdot \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13} = 4\\sqrt{30}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Semiperimeter and Side Lengths**:\n   From \\( s - a = 2\\sqrt{30} \\) and \\( s = \\frac{a + b + c}{2} \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a + b + c}{2} - a = 2\\sqrt{30} \\implies b + c - a = 4\\sqrt{30}.\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( a = 4\\sqrt{30} \\), we find:\n   \\[\n   b + c = 8\\sqrt{30}.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Area and Product \\( bc \\)**:\n   The area \\( \\Delta \\) can be expressed as \\( \\Delta = r \\cdot s = 6s \\) and \\( \\Delta = \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A \\). Substituting \\( \\sin A = \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13} \\) and \\( s = 6\\sqrt{30} \\), we find:\n   \\[\n   6 \\cdot 6\\sqrt{30} = \\frac{1}{2} bc \\cdot \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13} \\implies 36\\sqrt{30} = \\frac{bc\\sqrt{30}}{13} \\implies bc = 468.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the product \\( AB \\cdot AC = bc = 468 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{468}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC, which is AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nHmm, let me start by recalling some properties of triangle centers and the relationships between them. The circumradius R is 13, which is the radius of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC. The inradius r is 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle.\n\nI remember that the incenter I is the point where the angle bisectors meet, and the circumcenter O is where the perpendicular bisectors meet. In some triangles, like equilateral ones, these points coincide, but in general, they are different.\n\nGiven that IA is perpendicular to OI, that must mean that the line from I to A is perpendicular to the line from O to I. So, the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. That seems like an important piece of information.\n\nI think I can use coordinate geometry here. Maybe placing the triangle in a coordinate system where I can assign coordinates to O and I, then find the necessary lengths.\n\nWait, another thought: There might be a formula or relation involving the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. I recall that the distance between O and I can be found using the formula:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r)\n\nWhere R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nYes, that's right. The formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So, plugging in R = 13 and r = 6:\n\nOI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(13). And IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle OIA is a right triangle at I.\n\nSo, in triangle OIA, we have a right angle at I. So, by the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nOA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nBut OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, 13\u00b2 = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nCalculating that: 169 = 13 + IA\u00b2 \u2192 IA\u00b2 = 156 \u2192 IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nHmm, so IA is 2*sqrt(39). I know that the length of the inradius is 6, but IA is the distance from the inradius to vertex A, which is different. Wait, no, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side, not to the vertex.\n\nSo, IA is the length from the incenter to vertex A. There's a formula for the length of the inradius to a vertex, right? Let me recall.\n\nI think the formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by:\n\nIA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2),\n\nwhere s is the semi-perimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A, which is BC.\n\nAlternatively, I might be misremembering. Another formula I remember is that IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)), where A is the angle at vertex A.\n\nWait, let's think about that. In a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the inradius and the angles.\n\nYes, I think the formula is IA = r / sin(A/2). Similarly, IB = r / sin(B/2), and IC = r / sin(C/2).\n\nIf that's the case, then IA = 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39). So, 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nLet me solve for sin(A/2):\n\nsin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = (3*sqrt(39))/39 = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Let me compute cos(A/2) as well, since I might need it. Since sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 = 1,\n\ncos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt((169 - 39)/169) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nNow, I might need to relate this to the sides of the triangle. I know that in a triangle, the semi-perimeter s is related to the inradius by the formula:\n\nArea = r*s.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed in terms of the circumradius as:\n\nArea = (a*b*c)/(4R),\n\nwhere a, b, c are the sides of the triangle, and R is the circumradius.\n\nSo, if I can find expressions for the sides, maybe I can find AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nBut AB \u00b7 AC is equal to c*b, assuming AB is c and AC is b in the standard notation where a is BC, b is AC, c is AB.\n\nWait, let's get the notation straight. In standard triangle notation:\n\n- a is the length of BC,\n- b is the length of AC,\n- c is the length of AB.\n\nSo, AB is c, AC is b, BC is a.\n\nTherefore, AB \u00b7 AC = b*c.\n\nSo, I need to find b*c.\n\nHmm, how can I find b*c?\n\nI know that in triangle ABC, the product b*c can be related to other elements. For instance, using the formula for the area in terms of sides and angles:\n\nArea = (1/2)*b*c*sin(A).\n\nBut I also know that Area = r*s, where s is the semi-perimeter, (a+b+c)/2.\n\nAdditionally, from the Law of Sines, we have:\n\na = 2R sin A,\nb = 2R sin B,\nc = 2R sin C.\n\nSince R is 13, a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSo, b*c = (26 sin B)(26 sin C) = 676 sin B sin C.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that's directly helpful.\n\nWait, but since in any triangle, A + B + C = \u03c0, so B + C = \u03c0 - A.\n\nSo, sin B sin C can be expressed in terms of cos(B - C) - cos(B + C) over 2.\n\nWait, let me recall that identity:\n\nsin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)] / 2.\n\nSince B + C = \u03c0 - A, cos(B + C) = cos(\u03c0 - A) = -cos A.\n\nSo, sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) + cos A]/2.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find expressions involving sides a, b, c using the information I have.\n\nWait, from earlier, I have IA = 2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2). So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nI also have expressions for cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nI think there's a formula that relates the sides of the triangle to the inradius and semi-perimeter.\n\nWe have:\n\nArea = r*s,\n\nand also,\n\nArea = (a*b*c)/(4R).\n\nSo, equating these:\n\nr*s = (a*b*c)/(4R).\n\nSo,\n\ns = (a*b*c)/(4R*r).\n\nBut I don't know s yet, but maybe I can find another relation.\n\nAlternatively, I know that:\n\ntan(A/2) = r / (s - a).\n\nSo, since I have sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), I can find tan(A/2).\n\ntan(A/2) = sin(A/2)/cos(A/2) = (sqrt(39)/13)/(sqrt(130)/13) )= sqrt(39)/sqrt(130) = sqrt(39/130).\n\nSimplify sqrt(39/130): 39 = 3*13, 130 = 10*13. So, sqrt(39/130) = sqrt(3/10) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(10).\n\nSo, tan(A/2) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(10).\n\nBut tan(A/2) is also equal to r / (s - a), as per the formula.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(3)/sqrt(10) = r / (s - a) = 6 / (s - a).\n\nSo,\n\ns - a = 6 * sqrt(10)/sqrt(3) = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nWait, let me compute that again.\n\nsqrt(3)/sqrt(10) = 6 / (s - a)\n\n=> (s - a) = 6 * sqrt(10)/sqrt(3) = 6 * sqrt(30)/3 = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nYes, because sqrt(10)/sqrt(3) is sqrt(10/3) which can be rationalized as sqrt(30)/3.\n\nSo, 6 * (sqrt(30)/3) = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s - a = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s = a + 2*sqrt(30).\n\nBut s is (a + b + c)/2. So,\n\n(a + b + c)/2 = a + 2*sqrt(30)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\na + b + c = 2a + 4*sqrt(30)\n\nSubtract a:\n\nb + c = a + 4*sqrt(30)\n\nHmm, so b + c = a + 4*sqrt(30).\n\nThat's one equation involving sides a, b, c.\n\nAnother thought: using the formula for the distance from the inradius to the vertex, IA.\n\nEarlier, I found that IA = 2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nBut perhaps I can find another expression for IA in terms of the sides.\n\nWait, another formula for IA is sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nWait, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nBecause the inradius is r, and the distance from the inradius to the vertex can be found using the formula IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nWe know IA\u00b2 is (2*sqrt(39))\u00b2 = 4*39 = 156.\n\nSo,\n\n156 = 6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2\n\n156 = 36 + (s - a)^2\n\n(s - a)^2 = 120\n\nSo, s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30), which matches what I found earlier. So that's consistent.\n\nSo, s - a = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nNow, s = (a + b + c)/2 = a + 2*sqrt(30), as before.\n\nSo, a + b + c = 2a + 4*sqrt(30), so b + c = a + 4*sqrt(30).\n\nOkay, so that's one equation.\n\nAnother equation can come from the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines.\n\nWait, since I have the circumradius R = 13, I can relate the sides to the angles.\n\nFrom the Law of Sines:\n\na = 2R sin A = 26 sin A,\n\nb = 26 sin B,\n\nc = 26 sin C.\n\nAlso, since A + B + C = \u03c0, B + C = \u03c0 - A.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express sin B and sin C in terms of A.\n\nWait, but I need to relate b and c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express b + c in terms of a and the angle A.\n\nWait, from the earlier equation, b + c = a + 4*sqrt(30).\n\nBut a = 26 sin A.\n\nSo,\n\nb + c = 26 sin A + 4*sqrt(30).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the formula for the area.\n\nArea = r*s = 6*s.\n\nBut s = a + 2*sqrt(30), so Area = 6*(a + 2*sqrt(30)).\n\nBut also, Area = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(52).\n\nSo,\n\n6*(a + 2*sqrt(30)) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nMultiply both sides by 52:\n\n312*(a + 2*sqrt(30)) = a*b*c.\n\nBut a*b*c = 26^3 sin A sin B sin C.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express b*c in terms of a.\n\nFrom the earlier equation, b + c = a + 4*sqrt(30).\n\nIf I can find another equation involving b and c, perhaps I can solve for b*c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the area in terms of sides and angles.\n\nArea = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nSo,\n\n6*s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nWe know s = a + 2*sqrt(30), so:\n\n6*(a + 2*sqrt(30)) = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n12*(a + 2*sqrt(30)) = b*c*sin A.\n\nBut from the Law of Sines, sin A = a/(2R) = a/26.\n\nSo,\n\n12*(a + 2*sqrt(30)) = b*c*(a/26).\n\nMultiply both sides by 26:\n\n312*(a + 2*sqrt(30)) = a*b*c.\n\nWait, but earlier we had from the Area formula:\n\n312*(a + 2*sqrt(30)) = a*b*c.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nWait, let me think of another approach.\n\nSince I have expressions involving sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), maybe I can find cos A using double angle formulas.\n\ncos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 - 78)/169 = 91/169 = 7*13/(13*13) = 7/13.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, cos A = 7/13.\n\nSo, cos A = 7/13.\n\nThen, sin A = sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 49/169) = sqrt(120/169) = sqrt(120)/13 = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nTherefore, from the Law of Sines,\n\na = 2R sin A = 26*(2*sqrt(30)/13) = 2*2*sqrt(30) = 4*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, a = BC = 4*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, a = 4*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, that's one side known.\n\nNow, from earlier, we have:\n\nb + c = a + 4*sqrt(30) = 4*sqrt(30) + 4*sqrt(30) = 8*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, b + c = 8*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, that's the sum of sides b and c.\n\nWe need to find b*c.\n\nIf I can find another equation involving b and c, I can solve for their product.\n\nHmm, perhaps using the formula for the area in terms of sides and angles.\n\nWe have Area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nWe also have Area = r*s = 6*(a + 2*sqrt(30)).\n\nLet's compute both expressions.\n\nFirst, compute s = a + 2*sqrt(30) = 4*sqrt(30) + 2*sqrt(30) = 6*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s = 6*sqrt(30).\n\nTherefore, Area = 6*s = 6*(6*sqrt(30)) = 36*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, Area = 36*sqrt(30).\n\nFrom the other formula:\n\nArea = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nWe have sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo,\n\n36*sqrt(30) = (1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13).\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) = (b*c*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo,\n\n36*sqrt(30) = (b*c*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(30):\n\n36 = (b*c)/13.\n\nMultiply both sides by 13:\n\nb*c = 468.\n\nSo, AB \u00b7 AC = c*b = 468.\n\nSo, the answer is 468.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.\n\nLet me recap:\n\n1. OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr = 169 - 156 = 13 \u2192 OI = sqrt(13).\n2. In triangle OIA, right-angled at I: OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 \u2192 13\u00b2 = 13 + IA\u00b2 \u2192 IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).\n3. IA = r / sin(A/2) \u2192 2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2) \u2192 sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n4. cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n5. tan(A/2) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(10) = r / (s - a) \u2192 6 / (s - a) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(10) \u2192 s - a = 2*sqrt(30).\n6. s = a + 2*sqrt(30).\n7. From Law of Sines: a = 26 sin A. From sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), we found sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13 \u2192 a = 4*sqrt(30).\n8. Therefore, s = 4*sqrt(30) + 2*sqrt(30) = 6*sqrt(30).\n9. Area = r*s = 6*6*sqrt(30) = 36*sqrt(30).\n10. Using Area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A: 36*sqrt(30) = (1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) \u2192 36*sqrt(30) = (b*c*sqrt(30))/13 \u2192 b*c = 468.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the product AB \u00b7 AC is 468.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC, which is AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nHmm, let me start by recalling some properties of triangle centers and the relationships between them. The circumradius R is 13, which is the radius of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC. The inradius r is 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle.\n\nI remember that the incenter I is the point where the angle bisectors meet, and the circumcenter O is where the perpendicular bisectors meet. In some triangles, like equilateral ones, these points coincide, but in general, they are different.\n\nGiven that IA is perpendicular to OI, that must mean that the line from I to A is perpendicular to the line from O to I. So, the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. That seems like an important piece of information.\n\nI think I can use coordinate geometry here. Maybe placing the triangle in a coordinate system where I can assign coordinates to O and I, then find the necessary lengths.\n\nWait, another thought: There might be a formula or relation involving the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. I recall that the distance between O and I can be found using the formula:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r)\n\nWhere R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nYes, that's right. The formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So, plugging in R = 13 and r = 6:\n\nOI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(13). And IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle OIA is a right triangle at I.\n\nSo, in triangle OIA, we have a right angle at I. So, by the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nOA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nBut OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, 13\u00b2 = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nCalculating that: 169 = 13 + IA\u00b2 \u2192 IA\u00b2 = 156 \u2192 IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nHmm, so IA is 2*sqrt(39). I know that the length of the inradius is 6, but IA is the distance from the inradius to vertex A, which is different. Wait, no, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side, not to the vertex.\n\nSo, IA is the length from the incenter to vertex A. There's a formula for the length of the inradius to a vertex, right? Let me recall.\n\nI think the formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by:\n\nIA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2),\n\nwhere s is the semi-perimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A, which is BC.\n\nAlternatively, I might be misremembering. Another formula I remember is that IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)), where A is the angle at vertex A.\n\nWait, let's think about that. In a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the inradius and the angles.\n\nYes, I think the formula is IA = r / sin(A/2). Similarly, IB = r / sin(B/2), and IC = r / sin(C/2).\n\nIf that's the case, then IA = 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39). So, 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nLet me solve for sin(A/2):\n\nsin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = (3*sqrt(39))/39 = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Let me compute cos(A/2) as well, since I might need it. Since sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 = 1,\n\ncos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt((169 - 39)/169) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nNow, I might need to relate this to the sides of the triangle. I know that in a triangle, the semi-perimeter s is related to the inradius by the formula:\n\nArea = r*s.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed in terms of the circumradius as:\n\nArea = (a*b*c)/(4R),\n\nwhere a, b, c are the sides of the triangle, and R is the circumradius.\n\nSo, if I can find expressions for the sides, maybe I can find AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nBut AB \u00b7 AC is equal to c*b, assuming AB is c and AC is b in the standard notation where a is BC, b is AC, c is AB.\n\nWait, let's get the notation straight. In standard triangle notation:\n\n- a is the length of BC,\n- b is the length of AC,\n- c is the length of AB.\n\nSo, AB is c, AC is b, BC is a.\n\nTherefore, AB \u00b7 AC = b*c.\n\nSo, I need to find b*c.\n\nHmm, how can I find b*c?\n\nI know that in triangle ABC, the product b*c can be related to other elements. For instance, using the formula for the area in terms of sides and angles:\n\nArea = (1/2)*b*c*sin(A).\n\nBut I also know that Area = r*s, where s is the semi-perimeter, (a+b+c)/2.\n\nAdditionally, from the Law of Sines, we have:\n\na = 2R sin A,\nb = 2R sin B,\nc = 2R sin C.\n\nSince R is 13, a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSo, b*c = (26 sin B)(26 sin C) = 676 sin B sin C.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that's directly helpful.\n\nWait, but since in any triangle, A + B + C = \u03c0, so B + C = \u03c0 - A.\n\nSo, sin B sin C can be expressed in terms of cos(B - C) - cos(B + C) over 2.\n\nWait, let me recall that identity:\n\nsin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)] / 2.\n\nSince B + C = \u03c0 - A, cos(B + C) = cos(\u03c0 - A) = -cos A.\n\nSo, sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) + cos A]/2.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find expressions involving sides a, b, c using the information I have.\n\nWait, from earlier, I have IA = 2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2). So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nI also have expressions for cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nI think there's a formula that relates the sides of the triangle to the inradius and semi-perimeter.\n\nWe have:\n\nArea = r*s,\n\nand also,\n\nArea = (a*b*c)/(4R).\n\nSo, equating these:\n\nr*s = (a*b*c)/(4R).\n\nSo,\n\ns = (a*b*c)/(4R*r).\n\nBut I don't know s yet, but maybe I can find another relation.\n\nAlternatively, I know that:\n\ntan(A/2) = r / (s - a).\n\nSo, since I have sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), I can find tan(A/2).\n\ntan(A/2) = sin(A/2)/cos(A/2) = (sqrt(39)/13)/(sqrt(130)/13) )= sqrt(39)/sqrt(130) = sqrt(39/130).\n\nSimplify sqrt(39/130): 39 = 3*13, 130 = 10*13. So, sqrt(39/130) = sqrt(3/10) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(10).\n\nSo, tan(A/2) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(10).\n\nBut tan(A/2) is also equal to r / (s - a), as per the formula.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(3)/sqrt(10) = r / (s - a) = 6 / (s - a).\n\nSo,\n\ns - a = 6 * sqrt(10)/sqrt(3) = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nWait, let me compute that again.\n\nsqrt(3)/sqrt(10) = 6 / (s - a)\n\n=> (s - a) = 6 * sqrt(10)/sqrt(3) = 6 * sqrt(30)/3 = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nYes, because sqrt(10)/sqrt(3) is sqrt(10/3) which can be rationalized as sqrt(30)/3.\n\nSo, 6 * (sqrt(30)/3) = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s - a = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s = a + 2*sqrt(30).\n\nBut s is (a + b + c)/2. So,\n\n(a + b + c)/2 = a + 2*sqrt(30)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\na + b + c = 2a + 4*sqrt(30)\n\nSubtract a:\n\nb + c = a + 4*sqrt(30)\n\nHmm, so b + c = a + 4*sqrt(30).\n\nThat's one equation involving sides a, b, c.\n\nAnother thought: using the formula for the distance from the inradius to the vertex, IA.\n\nEarlier, I found that IA = 2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nBut perhaps I can find another expression for IA in terms of the sides.\n\nWait, another formula for IA is sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nWait, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nBecause the inradius is r, and the distance from the inradius to the vertex can be found using the formula IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nWe know IA\u00b2 is (2*sqrt(39))\u00b2 = 4*39 = 156.\n\nSo,\n\n156 = 6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2\n\n156 = 36 + (s - a)^2\n\n(s - a)^2 = 120\n\nSo, s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30), which matches what I found earlier. So that's consistent.\n\nSo, s - a = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nNow, s = (a + b + c)/2 = a + 2*sqrt(30), as before.\n\nSo, a + b + c = 2a + 4*sqrt(30), so b + c = a + 4*sqrt(30).\n\nOkay, so that's one equation.\n\nAnother equation can come from the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines.\n\nWait, since I have the circumradius R = 13, I can relate the sides to the angles.\n\nFrom the Law of Sines:\n\na = 2R sin A = 26 sin A,\n\nb = 26 sin B,\n\nc = 26 sin C.\n\nAlso, since A + B + C = \u03c0, B + C = \u03c0 - A.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express sin B and sin C in terms of A.\n\nWait, but I need to relate b and c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express b + c in terms of a and the angle A.\n\nWait, from the earlier equation, b + c = a + 4*sqrt(30).\n\nBut a = 26 sin A.\n\nSo,\n\nb + c = 26 sin A + 4*sqrt(30).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the formula for the area.\n\nArea = r*s = 6*s.\n\nBut s = a + 2*sqrt(30), so Area = 6*(a + 2*sqrt(30)).\n\nBut also, Area = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(52).\n\nSo,\n\n6*(a + 2*sqrt(30)) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nMultiply both sides by 52:\n\n312*(a + 2*sqrt(30)) = a*b*c.\n\nBut a*b*c = 26^3 sin A sin B sin C.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express b*c in terms of a.\n\nFrom the earlier equation, b + c = a + 4*sqrt(30).\n\nIf I can find another equation involving b and c, perhaps I can solve for b*c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the area in terms of sides and angles.\n\nArea = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nSo,\n\n6*s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nWe know s = a + 2*sqrt(30), so:\n\n6*(a + 2*sqrt(30)) = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n12*(a + 2*sqrt(30)) = b*c*sin A.\n\nBut from the Law of Sines, sin A = a/(2R) = a/26.\n\nSo,\n\n12*(a + 2*sqrt(30)) = b*c*(a/26).\n\nMultiply both sides by 26:\n\n312*(a + 2*sqrt(30)) = a*b*c.\n\nWait, but earlier we had from the Area formula:\n\n312*(a + 2*sqrt(30)) = a*b*c.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nWait, let me think of another approach.\n\nSince I have expressions involving sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), maybe I can find cos A using double angle formulas.\n\ncos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 - 78)/169 = 91/169 = 7*13/(13*13) = 7/13.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, cos A = 7/13.\n\nSo, cos A = 7/13.\n\nThen, sin A = sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 49/169) = sqrt(120/169) = sqrt(120)/13 = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nTherefore, from the Law of Sines,\n\na = 2R sin A = 26*(2*sqrt(30)/13) = 2*2*sqrt(30) = 4*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, a = BC = 4*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, a = 4*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, that's one side known.\n\nNow, from earlier, we have:\n\nb + c = a + 4*sqrt(30) = 4*sqrt(30) + 4*sqrt(30) = 8*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, b + c = 8*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, that's the sum of sides b and c.\n\nWe need to find b*c.\n\nIf I can find another equation involving b and c, I can solve for their product.\n\nHmm, perhaps using the formula for the area in terms of sides and angles.\n\nWe have Area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nWe also have Area = r*s = 6*(a + 2*sqrt(30)).\n\nLet's compute both expressions.\n\nFirst, compute s = a + 2*sqrt(30) = 4*sqrt(30) + 2*sqrt(30) = 6*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s = 6*sqrt(30).\n\nTherefore, Area = 6*s = 6*(6*sqrt(30)) = 36*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, Area = 36*sqrt(30).\n\nFrom the other formula:\n\nArea = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nWe have sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo,\n\n36*sqrt(30) = (1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13).\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) = (b*c*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo,\n\n36*sqrt(30) = (b*c*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(30):\n\n36 = (b*c)/13.\n\nMultiply both sides by 13:\n\nb*c = 468.\n\nSo, AB \u00b7 AC = c*b = 468.\n\nSo, the answer is 468.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.\n\nLet me recap:\n\n1. OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr = 169 - 156 = 13 \u2192 OI = sqrt(13).\n2. In triangle OIA, right-angled at I: OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 \u2192 13\u00b2 = 13 + IA\u00b2 \u2192 IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).\n3. IA = r / sin(A/2) \u2192 2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2) \u2192 sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n4. cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n5. tan(A/2) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(10) = r / (s - a) \u2192 6 / (s - a) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(10) \u2192 s - a = 2*sqrt(30).\n6. s = a + 2*sqrt(30).\n7. From Law of Sines: a = 26 sin A. From sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), we found sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13 \u2192 a = 4*sqrt(30).\n8. Therefore, s = 4*sqrt(30) + 2*sqrt(30) = 6*sqrt(30).\n9. Area = r*s = 6*6*sqrt(30) = 36*sqrt(30).\n10. Using Area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A: 36*sqrt(30) = (1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) \u2192 36*sqrt(30) = (b*c*sqrt(30))/13 \u2192 b*c = 468.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the product AB \u00b7 AC is 468.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by using the given information and key geometric formulas.\n\n1. **Distance between Incenter and Circumcenter**:\n   The distance \\( OI \\) is calculated using the formula \\( OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \\), where \\( R = 13 \\) and \\( r = 6 \\):\n   \\[\n   OI^2 = 13^2 - 2 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 6 = 169 - 156 = 13 \\implies OI = \\sqrt{13}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Right Triangle \\( OIA \\)**:\n   Since \\( IA \\perp OI \\), triangle \\( OIA \\) is a right triangle at \\( I \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:\n\nLet triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nHmm, okay. So, triangle ABC has a circumradius (R) of 13 and an inradius (r) of 6. The incenter I is the point where the angle bisectors meet, and the circumcenter O is the center of the circumscribed circle around the triangle. The condition given is that IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the inradius and the circumradius are related to various other properties, like the area, semiperimeter, and the sides of the triangle. Also, there are some relations involving the distance between the incenter and circumcenter.\n\nFirst, let's recall some important formulas.\n\nThe area (\u0394) of a triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter (s) as \u0394 = r * s. Also, the area can be expressed in terms of the circumradius and the sides as \u0394 = (a * b * c) / (4R), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.\n\nAdditionally, the distance between the incenter (I) and circumcenter (O) is given by the formula:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r)\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). So, OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr.\n\nLet me plug in the given values. R is 13, r is 6.\n\nSo, OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).\n\nWait, but in this problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the incenter to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the incenter to the circumcenter.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Maybe I can draw a diagram in my mind. Point I is inside the triangle, and O is the circumcenter, which could be inside or outside depending on the triangle type. But since the triangle has a circumradius of 13, which is larger than the inradius of 6, it's probably an acute triangle, so O is inside as well.\n\nSo, OI is a line from the incenter to the circumcenter. IA is a line from the incenter to vertex A. These two lines are perpendicular.\n\nI think I need to find some relation between IA, OI, and the sides of the triangle.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use coordinate geometry. Let me try to set up a coordinate system.\n\nLet me place the incenter I at the origin (0,0). Then, the circumcenter O is at some point (h, k), and IA is a line from (0,0) to point A, which is (x, y). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vectors IA and OI should have a dot product of zero.\n\nWait, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then the vector from I to A is perpendicular to the vector from I to O. So, if I is at (0,0), then O is at (h, k), and A is at (x, y). So, vector IA is (x, y), and vector OI is (h, k). Their dot product is x*h + y*k = 0.\n\nSo, x*h + y*k = 0.\n\nHmm, okay, that's one condition. But I'm not sure if this is the best approach because it might get complicated with too many variables.\n\nMaybe there's a better way using triangle properties.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the inradius can be expressed as r = \u0394/s, where \u0394 is the area and s is the semiperimeter. The circumradius is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4\u0394). Also, there's Euler's formula that relates R, r, and the distance between O and I: OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr.\n\nWait, I already used that earlier to find OI = sqrt(13). So, OI = sqrt(13).\n\nNow, the condition is that IA is perpendicular to OI. Let me think about the length of IA.\n\nI think the length of IA can be found using the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex. The formula for IA is sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2), where s is the semiperimeter and a is the side opposite vertex A. Similarly, IB = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - b)\u00b2), and IC = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - c)\u00b2).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recall. I think the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2). Yes, that seems right.\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, for other vertices.\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps we can use Pythagoras' theorem in triangle OIA. Because IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at I.\n\nSo, in triangle OIA, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nBut OA is the distance from the circumcenter to vertex A. Wait, in a triangle, the distance from the circumcenter to a vertex is just the circumradius R. Because all vertices lie on the circumcircle. So, OA = R = 13.\n\nSo, OA\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169.\n\nBut from triangle OIA, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nSo, 169 = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nWhich means 169 = 13 + IA\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, IA\u00b2 = 169 - 13 = 156.\n\nSo, IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nNow, using the formula for IA\u00b2: IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2.\n\nSo, 156 = 6\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2.\n\nWhich is 156 = 36 + (s - a)\u00b2.\n\nSo, (s - a)\u00b2 = 120.\n\nThus, s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, okay, so s - a = 2\u221a30.\n\nSimilarly, maybe we can find expressions for other sides.\n\nBut we need to find AB \u00b7 AC. Let's see, AB is side c, and AC is side b, depending on the notation. Wait, in triangle ABC, side opposite vertex A is a, side opposite vertex B is c, and side opposite vertex C is b. Wait, no, actually, the standard notation is a is BC, b is AC, c is AB.\n\nSo, AB is side c, AC is side b, BC is side a.\n\nSo, AB \u00b7 AC is b * c.\n\nHmm, okay, so our target is to find b * c.\n\nLet me think about how to relate this. I know that in a triangle, the area can be expressed as \u0394 = r * s, and also \u0394 = (a b c)/(4R). So, maybe we can relate these.\n\nGiven that, let's write down what we know:\n\n- R = 13\n- r = 6\n- OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr = 169 - 156 = 13 \u21d2 OI = sqrt(13)\n- IA\u00b2 = 156 \u21d2 IA = 2*sqrt(39)\n- IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2 \u21d2 (s - a) = 2*sqrt(30)\n\nSo, s - a = 2\u221a30.\n\nSimilarly, if I can find s - b and s - c, perhaps I can find more information.\n\nWait, but we only have one condition here, IA perpendicular to OI. Maybe we can get another equation by considering other perpendiculars or relations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex in terms of the sides.\n\nWait, another formula for IA is IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Is that correct?\n\nWait, yes, I think the distance from the inradius to vertex A can also be expressed in terms of the angle at A.\n\nLet me recall: in a triangle, the inradius is r = \u0394/s, and the distance from the incenter to vertex A is IA = (r)/sin(A/2).\n\nWait, let me verify that.\n\nIn triangle AIF, where F is the point where the incircle touches side BC, we have IA = r / sin(A/2). Hmm, yes, that's correct because in that right triangle, sin(A/2) = opposite side over hypotenuse, which is r / IA.\n\nSo, IA = r / sin(A/2).\n\nWe found IA = 2*sqrt(39) and r = 6. So,\n\n2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2)\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) ) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nWait, because 3/sqrt(39) can be rationalized as (3*sqrt(39))/39 = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nHmm, okay, so that gives us some information about angle A.\n\nAlso, since we have sin(A/2), we can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 = 1.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nWait, 130 is 13*10, so sqrt(130) can't be simplified further.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nNow, in triangle ABC, using the formula for the semiperimeter s, and the sides.\n\nI also know that the area \u0394 can be expressed as r*s = 6*s.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed using the formula (1/2)*ab*sin C. But perhaps using another formula involving the circumradius.\n\nWait, another formula for area is \u0394 = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, equating the two expressions for area:\n\n6*s = (a*b*c)/52\n\nSo, a*b*c = 6*52*s = 312*s.\n\nHmm, okay, that's one equation.\n\nWe also have that s - a = 2*sqrt(30), as found earlier.\n\nSimilarly, perhaps s - b and s - c can be found, but I don't have the other perpendicular conditions. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe we can find more relations using the formula for the area in terms of angle A.\n\nThe area can also be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nSo, \u0394 = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nBut we know \u0394 = 6*s.\n\nSo, 6*s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nWhich gives: b*c*sin A = 12*s.\n\nHmm, okay, but I don't know angle A yet.\n\nWait, but we can express sin A in terms of sin(A/2) and cos(A/2). Using the double-angle formula: sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2).\n\nSo, sin A = 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = 2*(sqrt(39*130))/169.\n\nCompute sqrt(39*130): 39*130 = 5070.\n\nWait, 5070 is 5070. Let me see if it factors into squares.\n\n5070 = 10 * 507 = 10 * 3 * 169 = 10 * 3 * 13\u00b2.\n\nSo, sqrt(5070) = sqrt(10 * 3 * 13\u00b2) = 13*sqrt(30).\n\nBecause sqrt(10*3) = sqrt(30).\n\nSo, sqrt(5070) = 13*sqrt(30).\n\nThus, sin A = 2*(13*sqrt(30))/169 = (26*sqrt(30))/169 = (2*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, going back to the earlier equation: b*c*sin A = 12*s.\n\nSubstitute sin A:\n\nb*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) = 12*s.\n\nSo, (2*sqrt(30)/13) * b*c = 12*s.\n\nThus, b*c = (12*s * 13)/(2*sqrt(30)) = (156 s)/(2 sqrt(30)) = (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nSimplify that:\n\nb*c = (78 s) / sqrt(30) = (78 s * sqrt(30)) / 30 = (13 s * sqrt(30)) / 5.\n\nWait, because 78 divided by 30 is 2.6, which is 13/5. So, yes, 78/30 = 13/5.\n\nSo, b*c = (13 s sqrt(30)) / 5.\n\nHmm, okay, so that's another equation involving b*c and s.\n\nBut I need another relation to connect these variables.\n\nWait, let's recall that s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nAnd from earlier, we have s - a = 2*sqrt(30). So, a = s - 2*sqrt(30).\n\nSimilarly, if I can find s - b and s - c, but I don't have conditions on IB and IC being perpendicular to OI. So, maybe I can't get those.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in a triangle, the product of the sides can be related to the circumradius and the area.\n\nWait, we already have a*b*c = 312*s from earlier.\n\nSo, a*b*c = 312*s.\n\nBut we have a = s - 2*sqrt(30), and we're trying to find b*c.\n\nLet me substitute a into this equation.\n\nSo, (s - 2\u221a30) * b * c = 312 s.\n\nBut from earlier, we have b*c = (13 s sqrt(30)) / 5.\n\nSo, substitute that in:\n\n(s - 2\u221a30) * (13 s sqrt(30)/5) = 312 s.\n\nLet me write that:\n\n(s - 2\u221a30) * (13 s sqrt(30)/5) = 312 s.\n\nWe can cancel s from both sides, assuming s \u2260 0, which it isn't because it's a semiperimeter.\n\nSo, (s - 2\u221a30) * (13 sqrt(30)/5) = 312.\n\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n\n(s - 2\u221a30) * 13 sqrt(30) = 1560.\n\nDivide both sides by 13 sqrt(30):\n\ns - 2\u221a30 = 1560 / (13 sqrt(30)).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n1560 / 13 = 120. So,\n\ns - 2\u221a30 = 120 / sqrt(30).\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\n120 / sqrt(30) = (120 sqrt(30)) / 30 = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo,\n\ns - 2\u221a30 = 4\u221a30.\n\nSo, s = 4\u221a30 + 2\u221a30 = 6\u221a30.\n\nThus, semiperimeter s = 6\u221a30.\n\nSo, s = 6\u221a30.\n\nNow, we can find a:\n\na = s - 2\u221a30 = 6\u221a30 - 2\u221a30 = 4\u221a30.\n\nSo, side a = BC = 4\u221a30.\n\nNow, let's compute b*c.\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\nb*c = (13 s sqrt(30)) / 5.\n\nSubstituting s = 6\u221a30:\n\nb*c = (13 * 6\u221a30 * sqrt(30)) / 5.\n\nSimplify sqrt(30)*sqrt(30) = 30.\n\nSo,\n\nb*c = (13 * 6 * 30) / 5.\n\nCompute numerator: 13 * 6 = 78; 78 * 30 = 2340.\n\nDenominator: 5.\n\nSo, 2340 / 5 = 468.\n\nTherefore, b*c = 468.\n\nSo, AB \u00b7 AC = c * b = 468.\n\nWait, that's the answer? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, let me recap:\n\nWe found that s = 6\u221a30, a = 4\u221a30.\n\nFrom a*b*c = 312*s = 312*6\u221a30.\n\nCompute 312*6: 312*6=1872.\n\nSo, a*b*c = 1872\u221a30.\n\nBut a is 4\u221a30, so:\n\n4\u221a30 * b*c = 1872\u221a30.\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a30:\n\n4 b*c = 1872.\n\nSo, b*c = 1872 / 4 = 468.\n\nYes, that matches. So, the product AB \u00b7 AC is 468.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 468.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:\n\nLet triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nHmm, okay. So, triangle ABC has a circumradius (R) of 13 and an inradius (r) of 6. The incenter I is the point where the angle bisectors meet, and the circumcenter O is the center of the circumscribed circle around the triangle. The condition given is that IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the inradius and the circumradius are related to various other properties, like the area, semiperimeter, and the sides of the triangle. Also, there are some relations involving the distance between the incenter and circumcenter.\n\nFirst, let's recall some important formulas.\n\nThe area (\u0394) of a triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter (s) as \u0394 = r * s. Also, the area can be expressed in terms of the circumradius and the sides as \u0394 = (a * b * c) / (4R), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.\n\nAdditionally, the distance between the incenter (I) and circumcenter (O) is given by the formula:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r)\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). So, OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr.\n\nLet me plug in the given values. R is 13, r is 6.\n\nSo, OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).\n\nWait, but in this problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the incenter to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the incenter to the circumcenter.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Maybe I can draw a diagram in my mind. Point I is inside the triangle, and O is the circumcenter, which could be inside or outside depending on the triangle type. But since the triangle has a circumradius of 13, which is larger than the inradius of 6, it's probably an acute triangle, so O is inside as well.\n\nSo, OI is a line from the incenter to the circumcenter. IA is a line from the incenter to vertex A. These two lines are perpendicular.\n\nI think I need to find some relation between IA, OI, and the sides of the triangle.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use coordinate geometry. Let me try to set up a coordinate system.\n\nLet me place the incenter I at the origin (0,0). Then, the circumcenter O is at some point (h, k), and IA is a line from (0,0) to point A, which is (x, y). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vectors IA and OI should have a dot product of zero.\n\nWait, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then the vector from I to A is perpendicular to the vector from I to O. So, if I is at (0,0), then O is at (h, k), and A is at (x, y). So, vector IA is (x, y), and vector OI is (h, k). Their dot product is x*h + y*k = 0.\n\nSo, x*h + y*k = 0.\n\nHmm, okay, that's one condition. But I'm not sure if this is the best approach because it might get complicated with too many variables.\n\nMaybe there's a better way using triangle properties.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the inradius can be expressed as r = \u0394/s, where \u0394 is the area and s is the semiperimeter. The circumradius is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4\u0394). Also, there's Euler's formula that relates R, r, and the distance between O and I: OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr.\n\nWait, I already used that earlier to find OI = sqrt(13). So, OI = sqrt(13).\n\nNow, the condition is that IA is perpendicular to OI. Let me think about the length of IA.\n\nI think the length of IA can be found using the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex. The formula for IA is sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2), where s is the semiperimeter and a is the side opposite vertex A. Similarly, IB = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - b)\u00b2), and IC = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - c)\u00b2).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recall. I think the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2). Yes, that seems right.\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, for other vertices.\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps we can use Pythagoras' theorem in triangle OIA. Because IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at I.\n\nSo, in triangle OIA, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nBut OA is the distance from the circumcenter to vertex A. Wait, in a triangle, the distance from the circumcenter to a vertex is just the circumradius R. Because all vertices lie on the circumcircle. So, OA = R = 13.\n\nSo, OA\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169.\n\nBut from triangle OIA, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nSo, 169 = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nWhich means 169 = 13 + IA\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, IA\u00b2 = 169 - 13 = 156.\n\nSo, IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nNow, using the formula for IA\u00b2: IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2.\n\nSo, 156 = 6\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2.\n\nWhich is 156 = 36 + (s - a)\u00b2.\n\nSo, (s - a)\u00b2 = 120.\n\nThus, s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, okay, so s - a = 2\u221a30.\n\nSimilarly, maybe we can find expressions for other sides.\n\nBut we need to find AB \u00b7 AC. Let's see, AB is side c, and AC is side b, depending on the notation. Wait, in triangle ABC, side opposite vertex A is a, side opposite vertex B is c, and side opposite vertex C is b. Wait, no, actually, the standard notation is a is BC, b is AC, c is AB.\n\nSo, AB is side c, AC is side b, BC is side a.\n\nSo, AB \u00b7 AC is b * c.\n\nHmm, okay, so our target is to find b * c.\n\nLet me think about how to relate this. I know that in a triangle, the area can be expressed as \u0394 = r * s, and also \u0394 = (a b c)/(4R). So, maybe we can relate these.\n\nGiven that, let's write down what we know:\n\n- R = 13\n- r = 6\n- OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr = 169 - 156 = 13 \u21d2 OI = sqrt(13)\n- IA\u00b2 = 156 \u21d2 IA = 2*sqrt(39)\n- IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2 \u21d2 (s - a) = 2*sqrt(30)\n\nSo, s - a = 2\u221a30.\n\nSimilarly, if I can find s - b and s - c, perhaps I can find more information.\n\nWait, but we only have one condition here, IA perpendicular to OI. Maybe we can get another equation by considering other perpendiculars or relations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex in terms of the sides.\n\nWait, another formula for IA is IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Is that correct?\n\nWait, yes, I think the distance from the inradius to vertex A can also be expressed in terms of the angle at A.\n\nLet me recall: in a triangle, the inradius is r = \u0394/s, and the distance from the incenter to vertex A is IA = (r)/sin(A/2).\n\nWait, let me verify that.\n\nIn triangle AIF, where F is the point where the incircle touches side BC, we have IA = r / sin(A/2). Hmm, yes, that's correct because in that right triangle, sin(A/2) = opposite side over hypotenuse, which is r / IA.\n\nSo, IA = r / sin(A/2).\n\nWe found IA = 2*sqrt(39) and r = 6. So,\n\n2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2)\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) ) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nWait, because 3/sqrt(39) can be rationalized as (3*sqrt(39))/39 = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nHmm, okay, so that gives us some information about angle A.\n\nAlso, since we have sin(A/2), we can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 = 1.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nWait, 130 is 13*10, so sqrt(130) can't be simplified further.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nNow, in triangle ABC, using the formula for the semiperimeter s, and the sides.\n\nI also know that the area \u0394 can be expressed as r*s = 6*s.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed using the formula (1/2)*ab*sin C. But perhaps using another formula involving the circumradius.\n\nWait, another formula for area is \u0394 = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, equating the two expressions for area:\n\n6*s = (a*b*c)/52\n\nSo, a*b*c = 6*52*s = 312*s.\n\nHmm, okay, that's one equation.\n\nWe also have that s - a = 2*sqrt(30), as found earlier.\n\nSimilarly, perhaps s - b and s - c can be found, but I don't have the other perpendicular conditions. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe we can find more relations using the formula for the area in terms of angle A.\n\nThe area can also be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nSo, \u0394 = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nBut we know \u0394 = 6*s.\n\nSo, 6*s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nWhich gives: b*c*sin A = 12*s.\n\nHmm, okay, but I don't know angle A yet.\n\nWait, but we can express sin A in terms of sin(A/2) and cos(A/2). Using the double-angle formula: sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2).\n\nSo, sin A = 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = 2*(sqrt(39*130))/169.\n\nCompute sqrt(39*130): 39*130 = 5070.\n\nWait, 5070 is 5070. Let me see if it factors into squares.\n\n5070 = 10 * 507 = 10 * 3 * 169 = 10 * 3 * 13\u00b2.\n\nSo, sqrt(5070) = sqrt(10 * 3 * 13\u00b2) = 13*sqrt(30).\n\nBecause sqrt(10*3) = sqrt(30).\n\nSo, sqrt(5070) = 13*sqrt(30).\n\nThus, sin A = 2*(13*sqrt(30))/169 = (26*sqrt(30))/169 = (2*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, going back to the earlier equation: b*c*sin A = 12*s.\n\nSubstitute sin A:\n\nb*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) = 12*s.\n\nSo, (2*sqrt(30)/13) * b*c = 12*s.\n\nThus, b*c = (12*s * 13)/(2*sqrt(30)) = (156 s)/(2 sqrt(30)) = (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nSimplify that:\n\nb*c = (78 s) / sqrt(30) = (78 s * sqrt(30)) / 30 = (13 s * sqrt(30)) / 5.\n\nWait, because 78 divided by 30 is 2.6, which is 13/5. So, yes, 78/30 = 13/5.\n\nSo, b*c = (13 s sqrt(30)) / 5.\n\nHmm, okay, so that's another equation involving b*c and s.\n\nBut I need another relation to connect these variables.\n\nWait, let's recall that s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nAnd from earlier, we have s - a = 2*sqrt(30). So, a = s - 2*sqrt(30).\n\nSimilarly, if I can find s - b and s - c, but I don't have conditions on IB and IC being perpendicular to OI. So, maybe I can't get those.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in a triangle, the product of the sides can be related to the circumradius and the area.\n\nWait, we already have a*b*c = 312*s from earlier.\n\nSo, a*b*c = 312*s.\n\nBut we have a = s - 2*sqrt(30), and we're trying to find b*c.\n\nLet me substitute a into this equation.\n\nSo, (s - 2\u221a30) * b * c = 312 s.\n\nBut from earlier, we have b*c = (13 s sqrt(30)) / 5.\n\nSo, substitute that in:\n\n(s - 2\u221a30) * (13 s sqrt(30)/5) = 312 s.\n\nLet me write that:\n\n(s - 2\u221a30) * (13 s sqrt(30)/5) = 312 s.\n\nWe can cancel s from both sides, assuming s \u2260 0, which it isn't because it's a semiperimeter.\n\nSo, (s - 2\u221a30) * (13 sqrt(30)/5) = 312.\n\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n\n(s - 2\u221a30) * 13 sqrt(30) = 1560.\n\nDivide both sides by 13 sqrt(30):\n\ns - 2\u221a30 = 1560 / (13 sqrt(30)).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n1560 / 13 = 120. So,\n\ns - 2\u221a30 = 120 / sqrt(30).\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\n120 / sqrt(30) = (120 sqrt(30)) / 30 = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo,\n\ns - 2\u221a30 = 4\u221a30.\n\nSo, s = 4\u221a30 + 2\u221a30 = 6\u221a30.\n\nThus, semiperimeter s = 6\u221a30.\n\nSo, s = 6\u221a30.\n\nNow, we can find a:\n\na = s - 2\u221a30 = 6\u221a30 - 2\u221a30 = 4\u221a30.\n\nSo, side a = BC = 4\u221a30.\n\nNow, let's compute b*c.\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\nb*c = (13 s sqrt(30)) / 5.\n\nSubstituting s = 6\u221a30:\n\nb*c = (13 * 6\u221a30 * sqrt(30)) / 5.\n\nSimplify sqrt(30)*sqrt(30) = 30.\n\nSo,\n\nb*c = (13 * 6 * 30) / 5.\n\nCompute numerator: 13 * 6 = 78; 78 * 30 = 2340.\n\nDenominator: 5.\n\nSo, 2340 / 5 = 468.\n\nTherefore, b*c = 468.\n\nSo, AB \u00b7 AC = c * b = 468.\n\nWait, that's the answer? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, let me recap:\n\nWe found that s = 6\u221a30, a = 4\u221a30.\n\nFrom a*b*c = 312*s = 312*6\u221a30.\n\nCompute 312*6: 312*6=1872.\n\nSo, a*b*c = 1872\u221a30.\n\nBut a is 4\u221a30, so:\n\n4\u221a30 * b*c = 1872\u221a30.\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a30:\n\n4 b*c = 1872.\n\nSo, b*c = 1872 / 4 = 468.\n\nYes, that matches. So, the product AB \u00b7 AC is 468.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 468.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting the given values: the circumradius \\( R = 13 \\) and the inradius \\( r = 6 \\). The distance between the circumcenter \\( O \\) and the incenter \\( I \\) is calculated using Euler's formula:\n\n\\[\nOI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr = 13^2 - 2 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 6 = 169 - 156 = 13 \\implies OI = \\sqrt{13}.\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\), triangle \\( OIA \\) is a right triangle at \\( I \\). Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\nOA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \\implies 13^2 = (\\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \\implies 169 = 13 + IA^2 \\implies IA^2 = 156 \\implies IA = 2\\sqrt{39}.\n\\]\n\nThe length \\( IA \\) can also be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nIA^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2 \\implies 156 = 6^2 + (s - a)^2 \\implies 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 \\implies (s - a)^2 = 120 \\implies s - a = 2\\sqrt{30}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the relationship between the semiperimeter \\( s \\), the inradius \\( r \\), and the area \\( \\Delta \\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = r \\cdot s = 6s.\n\\]\n\nThe area can also be expressed in terms of the circumradius:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = \\frac{abc}{4R} = \\frac{abc}{52}.\n\\]\n\nEquating the two expressions for the area:\n\n\\[\n6s = \\frac{abc}{52} \\implies abc = 312s.\n\\]\n\nUsing the sine formula for the area and the double-angle identity, we find:\n\n\\[\n\\sin A = 2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{A}{2}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{A}{2}\\right) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{130}}{13} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the area can also be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = \\frac{1}{2} bc \\sin A \\implies 6s = \\frac{1}{2} bc \\cdot \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13} \\implies bc \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{30}}{13} = 12s \\implies bc = \\frac{156s}{\\sqrt{30}}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( s = 6\\sqrt{30} \\):\n\n\\[\nbc = \\frac{156 \\cdot 6\\sqrt{30}}{\\sqrt{30}} = 156 \\cdot 6 = 936.\n\\]\n\nHowever, correcting the earlier steps, we find:\n\n\\[\ns = 6\\sqrt{30}, \\quad a = 4\\sqrt{30}, \\quad abc = 312s = 1872\\sqrt{30}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( a = 4\\sqrt{30} \\):\n\n\\[\n4\\sqrt{30} \\cdot bc = 1872\\sqrt{30} \\implies bc = \\frac{1872\\sqrt{30}}{4\\sqrt{30}} = 468.\n\\]\n\nThus, the product \\( AB \\cdot AC = bc = 468 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{468}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find AB multiplied by AC in triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. Hmm, that's a lot to unpack.\n\nFirst, let me recall some concepts. The circumradius R is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius r is the radius of the inscribed circle. The incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet, and the circumcenter O is where the perpendicular bisectors meet. \n\nGiven that IA is perpendicular to OI, that seems like a key piece of information. I think this might relate to some specific properties or formulas in triangle geometry. Maybe I can find a relationship between R and r, or perhaps use trigonometric identities.\n\nI remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r)\n\nLet me check that. Oh yeah, that's correct. It's a standard formula where OI is the distance between the circumradius and inradius centers.\n\nGiven that OI is the distance between O and I, and IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps I can use some right triangle properties here. Maybe triangle IOA is a right triangle? Wait, IA is perpendicular to OI, so point A, I, and O must form a right triangle with the right angle at I.\n\nSo, triangle IOA is right-angled at I. That means by the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nIA\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = OA\u00b2\n\nBut OA is the circumradius, right? Because O is the circumcenter, so OA is equal to R, which is 13.\n\nSo, OA = 13, OI can be found using the formula I mentioned earlier, and IA is the inradius, which is 6. Wait, no, IA is the length from I to A, which is not the inradius. The inradius is the distance from I to any side, not necessarily to the vertex. Hmm, I need to be careful here.\n\nWait, no, the inradius is the distance from I to each side, so IA is the distance from I to vertex A, which is different. I think IA is called the length of the inradius to the vertex, but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I can express IA in terms of other variables.\n\nI recall that the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be calculated using the formula:\n\nIA = \\sqrt{r^2 + (s - a)^2}\n\nWhere r is the inradius, s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A, which would be BC in this case. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, another formula for IA is:\n\nIA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}\n\nYes, that sounds familiar. Since I is the incenter, the angle at I from vertex A would be half of angle A, so IA is related to the inradius and the sine of half-angle A.\n\nSo, IA = r / sin(A/2). Since r is 6, IA = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nBut I also know that in triangle IOA, which is right-angled at I, we have:\n\nIA\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = OA\u00b2\n\nSo, substituting the known values:\n\n(6 / sin(A/2))\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2\n\nBut OI\u00b2 is equal to R(R - 2r) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So OI\u00b2 is 13.\n\nWait, that's a big simplification. So:\n\n(6 / sin(A/2))\u00b2 + 13 = 169\n\nSo, (36) / sin\u00b2(A/2) = 169 - 13 = 156\n\nTherefore:\n\n1 / sin\u00b2(A/2) = 156 / 36 = 13 / 3\n\nSo, sin\u00b2(A/2) = 3/13\n\nTaking the square root, sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13). Hmm, okay.\n\nSince sin(A/2) is sqrt(3/13), then IA = 6 / sqrt(3/13) = 6 * sqrt(13/3) = 6 * sqrt(13)/sqrt(3) = 2*sqrt(39). Hmm, maybe I can keep this as it is for now.\n\nBut I need to find AB * AC. Let's denote AB as c and AC as b. So, the product is b*c.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the area and other elements. The area is r*s, where s is the semiperimeter. Alternatively, the area can also be expressed as (a*b*c)/(4R). Hmm, not sure if that's directly helpful.\n\nWait, another formula I recall is that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be expressed as:\n\nb*c = 2R^2 * (1 - cos A)\n\nWait, is that correct? Or maybe it's something else.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the area in terms of sides and angles:\n\nArea = (1/2)*b*c*sin A\n\nBut I also know that the area is r*s, where s is the semiperimeter. So:\n\nr*s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A\n\nWhich can be rearranged as:\n\nb*c = (2*r*s)/sin A\n\nHmm, but I don't know s or sin A yet.\n\nWait, let's think about angle A. Since I found sin(A/2), maybe I can find sin A.\n\nUsing the double-angle formula:\n\nsin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2)\n\nI know sin(A/2) is sqrt(3/13), so cos(A/2) would be sqrt(1 - 3/13) = sqrt(10/13). So,\n\nsin A = 2*(sqrt(3/13))*(sqrt(10/13)) = 2*sqrt(30)/13\n\nSo, sin A is 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nNow, going back to the area formula:\n\nr*s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A\n\nSo,\n\nb*c = (2*r*s) / sin A\n\nWe have r=6, sin A=2*sqrt(30)/13, so:\n\nb*c = (2*6*s) / (2*sqrt(30)/13) ) = (12*s) / (2*sqrt(30)/13) ) = (6*s * 13)/sqrt(30) ) = (78*s)/sqrt(30)\n\nHmm, okay. So if I can find s, the semiperimeter, then I can find b*c.\n\nHow can I find s?\n\nWell, s = (a + b + c)/2, where a, b, c are the sides opposite angles A, B, C respectively. So a is BC, b is AC, c is AB.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find s using other relationships. I know R=13, r=6, and the distance OI= sqrt(R(R-2r))=sqrt(13*(13-12))=sqrt(13), which we already used.\n\nWait, another formula that relates R, r, and s is:\n\nr = 4R sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Alternatively, maybe I can find s using the formula:\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2, but without knowing any of the sides, this might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the area in two ways. The area is r*s, and also, it's (a*b*c)/(4R). So,\n\nr*s = (a*b*c)/(4R)\n\nBut I need to find b*c, so maybe I can express a in terms of other variables.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the sides. I know that in any triangle, a = 2R sin A. Because in the circumcircle, the side opposite angle A is a = 2R sin A.\n\nSo, a = 2*13*(2*sqrt(30)/13) ) = 2*13*(2*sqrt(30)/13) ) = 4*sqrt(30). Because 13 cancels out.\n\nSo, a = BC = 4*sqrt(30). That's one side.\n\nNow, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2. So, if I can express b + c in terms of other variables, maybe I can find s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the inradius:\n\nr = (Area)/s\n\nBut Area is r*s, so that's not helpful. Wait, but I also know that the area is (1/2)*b*c*sin A, so:\n\nr*s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A\n\nWhich we had earlier. So, substituting the known values:\n\n6*s = (1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n6*s = (b*c * sqrt(30))/13\n\nWhich rearranges to:\n\nb*c = (6*s *13)/sqrt(30) = (78*s)/sqrt(30)\n\nSo, if I can find s, I can find b*c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find s using other relationships. Let me think.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed as IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)), which we've already used.\n\nWait, but we found sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13). So, IA = 6 / sqrt(3/13) = 6*sqrt(13/3) = 2*sqrt(39). So, IA is 2*sqrt(39).\n\nBut how does that help me with s?\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the length of the angle bisector. The incenter divides the angle bisector in a specific ratio. Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates. If I can place the triangle in a coordinate system, perhaps I can compute the required lengths.\n\nLet me consider placing point A at (0,0), point B at (c,0), and point C at coordinates (d,e). Then, I can find the incenter and circumradius.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use trigonometric identities and the relations we have.\n\nWait, let's think about the formula for the semiperimeter s. We have:\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2\n\nAnd we have a = 4*sqrt(30). So, s = (4*sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.\n\nBut without knowing b and c individually, this is tricky.\n\nWait, another formula I recall is that in any triangle:\n\nb + c = 2s - a\n\nSo, if I can find b + c, I can find s.\n\nBut how? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the area in terms of r and s. The area is r*s = 6*s.\n\nAlso, the area is (1/2)*b*c*sin A = (1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) ) = (b*c * sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, equate the two expressions for area:\n\n6*s = (b*c * sqrt(30))/13\n\nSo, 6*s = (b*c * sqrt(30))/13\n\nFrom earlier, we have b*c = (78*s)/sqrt(30). Let's substitute that into this equation.\n\nWait, wait, that seems circular because we derived b*c in terms of s. Maybe I need another equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the circumradius:\n\nR = (a*b*c)/(4*Area)\n\nWe know R =13, a=4*sqrt(30), Area=6*s. So,\n\n13 = (4*sqrt(30) * b * c )/(4*6*s )\n\nSimplify:\n\n13 = (sqrt(30) * b * c )/(6*s )\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(30) * b * c = 78*s\n\nWhich gives:\n\nb*c = (78*s)/sqrt(30)\n\nWhich is the same as before. So, it's consistent, but not helpful in finding s.\n\nHmm, I need another equation to relate s with known quantities.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the distance from the inradius to vertex A, which is IA = 2*sqrt(39). We found IA earlier.\n\nI recall that in a triangle, the length from the incenter to vertex A is given by:\n\nIA = \\sqrt{r^2 + (s - a)^2}\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2\n\nWe have IA\u00b2 = (2*sqrt(39))\u00b2 = 4*39 = 156\n\nr\u00b2 = 36\n\n(s - a)\u00b2 = (s - 4*sqrt(30))\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\n156 = 36 + (s - 4*sqrt(30))\u00b2\n\nSubtract 36 from both sides:\n\n120 = (s - 4*sqrt(30))\u00b2\n\nTake square roots:\n\ns - 4*sqrt(30) = sqrt(120) or s - 4*sqrt(30) = -sqrt(120)\n\nBut since s is the semiperimeter, it must be positive and greater than each side. So, s must be greater than a, which is 4*sqrt(30). Therefore, s - 4*sqrt(30) is positive, so:\n\ns - 4*sqrt(30) = sqrt(120)\n\nSimplify sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30)\n\nSo,\n\ns = 4*sqrt(30) + 2*sqrt(30) = 6*sqrt(30)\n\nSo, s = 6*sqrt(30). That's a breakthrough!\n\nNow that we have s, we can find b*c. From earlier, we had:\n\nb*c = (78*s)/sqrt(30) = (78 * 6*sqrt(30))/sqrt(30) ) = 78 * 6 = 468\n\nWait, that's nice. Because sqrt(30) cancels out.\n\nSo, b*c = 468. Therefore, AB * AC = 468.\n\nWait, let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. We had OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).\n\n2. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle IOA is right-angled at I, so IA\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = OA\u00b2.\n\n3. OA is R=13, so IA\u00b2 + 13 = 169 \u2192 IA\u00b2 = 156 \u2192 IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\n4. Using IA = r / sin(A/2) \u2192 2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2) \u2192 sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(13).\n\nWait, wait, earlier I thought sin(A/2) was sqrt(3/13), which is the same as sqrt(3)/sqrt(13). So, that's correct.\n\nThen, using sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(sqrt(3)/sqrt(13))*(sqrt(10)/sqrt(13)) ) = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nThen, using the area formula:\n\nArea = r*s = 6*s\n\nAlso, Area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A \u2192 6*s = (1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) \u2192 6*s = (b*c * sqrt(30))/13 \u2192 b*c = (6*s *13)/sqrt(30) = (78*s)/sqrt(30)\n\nThen, using the formula for IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 \u2192 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 \u2192 (s - a)^2 = 120 \u2192 s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30)\n\nSince a = 4*sqrt(30), s = 4*sqrt(30) + 2*sqrt(30) = 6*sqrt(30)\n\nThen, substituting s into b*c = (78*s)/sqrt(30) \u2192 (78 * 6*sqrt(30))/sqrt(30) = 78*6 = 468.\n\nSo, all the steps check out, and the logic seems sound. I don't see any mistakes here.\n",

Hmm, not sure if that's directly helpful.\n\nWait, another formula I recall is that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be expressed as:\n\nb*c = 2R^2 * (1 - cos A)\n\nWait, is that correct? Or maybe it's something else.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the area in terms of sides and angles:\n\nArea = (1/2)*b*c*sin A\n\nBut I also know that the area is r*s, where s is the semiperimeter. So:\n\nr*s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A\n\nWhich can be rearranged as:\n\nb*c = (2*r*s)/sin A\n\nHmm, but I don't know s or sin A yet.\n\nWait, let's think about angle A. Since I found sin(A/2), maybe I can find sin A.\n\nUsing the double-angle formula:\n\nsin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2)\n\nI know sin(A/2) is sqrt(3/13), so cos(A/2) would be sqrt(1 - 3/13) = sqrt(10/13). So,\n\nsin A = 2*(sqrt(3/13))*(sqrt(10/13)) = 2*sqrt(30)/13\n\nSo, sin A is 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nNow, going back to the area formula:\n\nr*s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A\n\nSo,\n\nb*c = (2*r*s) / sin A\n\nWe have r=6, sin A=2*sqrt(30)/13, so:\n\nb*c = (2*6*s) / (2*sqrt(30)/13) ) = (12*s) / (2*sqrt(30)/13) ) = (6*s * 13)/sqrt(30) ) = (78*s)/sqrt(30)\n\nHmm, okay. So if I can find s, the semiperimeter, then I can find b*c.\n\nHow can I find s?\n\nWell, s = (a + b + c)/2, where a, b, c are the sides opposite angles A, B, C respectively. So a is BC, b is AC, c is AB.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find s using other relationships. I know R=13, r=6, and the distance OI= sqrt(R(R-2r))=sqrt(13*(13-12))=sqrt(13), which we already used.\n\nWait, another formula that relates R, r, and s is:\n\nr = 4R sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Alternatively, maybe I can find s using the formula:\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2, but without knowing any of the sides, this might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the area in two ways. The area is r*s, and also, it's (a*b*c)/(4R). So,\n\nr*s = (a*b*c)/(4R)\n\nBut I need to find b*c, so maybe I can express a in terms of other variables.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the sides. I know that in any triangle, a = 2R sin A. Because in the circumcircle, the side opposite angle A is a = 2R sin A.\n\nSo, a = 2*13*(2*sqrt(30)/13) ) = 2*13*(2*sqrt(30)/13) ) = 4*sqrt(30). Because 13 cancels out.\n\nSo, a = BC = 4*sqrt(30). That's one side.\n\nNow, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2. So, if I can express b + c in terms of other variables, maybe I can find s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the inradius:\n\nr = (Area)/s\n\nBut Area is r*s, so that's not helpful. Wait, but I also know that the area is (1/2)*b*c*sin A, so:\n\nr*s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A\n\nWhich we had earlier. So, substituting the known values:\n\n6*s = (1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n6*s = (b*c * sqrt(30))/13\n\nWhich rearranges to:\n\nb*c = (6*s *13)/sqrt(30) = (78*s)/sqrt(30)\n\nSo, if I can find s, I can find b*c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find s using other relationships. Let me think.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed as IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)), which we've already used.\n\nWait, but we found sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13). So, IA = 6 / sqrt(3/13) = 6*sqrt(13/3) = 2*sqrt(39). So, IA is 2*sqrt(39).\n\nBut how does that help me with s?\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the length of the angle bisector. The incenter divides the angle bisector in a specific ratio. Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates. If I can place the triangle in a coordinate system, perhaps I can compute the required lengths.\n\nLet me consider placing point A at (0,0), point B at (c,0), and point C at coordinates (d,e). Then, I can find the incenter and circumradius.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use trigonometric identities and the relations we have.\n\nWait, let's think about the formula for the semiperimeter s. We have:\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2\n\nAnd we have a = 4*sqrt(30). So, s = (4*sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.\n\nBut without knowing b and c individually, this is tricky.\n\nWait, another formula I recall is that in any triangle:\n\nb + c = 2s - a\n\nSo, if I can find b + c, I can find s.\n\nBut how? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the area in terms of r and s. The area is r*s = 6*s.\n\nAlso, the area is (1/2)*b*c*sin A = (1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) ) = (b*c * sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, equate the two expressions for area:\n\n6*s = (b*c * sqrt(30))/13\n\nSo, 6*s = (b*c * sqrt(30))/13\n\nFrom earlier, we have b*c = (78*s)/sqrt(30). Let's substitute that into this equation.\n\nWait, wait, that seems circular because we derived b*c in terms of s. Maybe I need another equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the circumradius:\n\nR = (a*b*c)/(4*Area)\n\nWe know R =13, a=4*sqrt(30), Area=6*s. So,\n\n13 = (4*sqrt(30) * b * c )/(4*6*s )\n\nSimplify:\n\n13 = (sqrt(30) * b * c )/(6*s )\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(30) * b * c = 78*s\n\nWhich gives:\n\nb*c = (78*s)/sqrt(30)\n\nWhich is the same as before. So, it's consistent, but not helpful in finding s.\n\nHmm, I need another equation to relate s with known quantities.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the distance from the inradius to vertex A, which is IA = 2*sqrt(39). We found IA earlier.\n\nI recall that in a triangle, the length from the incenter to vertex A is given by:\n\nIA = \\sqrt{r^2 + (s - a)^2}\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2\n\nWe have IA\u00b2 = (2*sqrt(39))\u00b2 = 4*39 = 156\n\nr\u00b2 = 36\n\n(s - a)\u00b2 = (s - 4*sqrt(30))\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\n156 = 36 + (s - 4*sqrt(30))\u00b2\n\nSubtract 36 from both sides:\n\n120 = (s - 4*sqrt(30))\u00b2\n\nTake square roots:\n\ns - 4*sqrt(30) = sqrt(120) or s - 4*sqrt(30) = -sqrt(120)\n\nBut since s is the semiperimeter, it must be positive and greater than each side. So, s must be greater than a, which is 4*sqrt(30). Therefore, s - 4*sqrt(30) is positive, so:\n\ns - 4*sqrt(30) = sqrt(120)\n\nSimplify sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30)\n\nSo,\n\ns = 4*sqrt(30) + 2*sqrt(30) = 6*sqrt(30)\n\nSo, s = 6*sqrt(30). That's a breakthrough!\n\nNow that we have s, we can find b*c. From earlier, we had:\n\nb*c = (78*s)/sqrt(30) = (78 * 6*sqrt(30))/sqrt(30) ) = 78 * 6 = 468\n\nWait, that's nice. Because sqrt(30) cancels out.\n\nSo, b*c = 468. Therefore, AB * AC = 468.\n\nWait, let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. We had OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).\n\n2. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle IOA is right-angled at I, so IA\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = OA\u00b2.\n\n3. OA is R=13, so IA\u00b2 + 13 = 169 \u2192 IA\u00b2 = 156 \u2192 IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\n4. Using IA = r / sin(A/2) \u2192 2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2) \u2192 sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(13).\n\nWait, wait, earlier I thought sin(A/2) was sqrt(3/13), which is the same as sqrt(3)/sqrt(13). So, that's correct.\n\nThen, using sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(sqrt(3)/sqrt(13))*(sqrt(10)/sqrt(13)) ) = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nThen, using the area formula:\n\nArea = r*s = 6*s\n\nAlso, Area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A \u2192 6*s = (1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) \u2192 6*s = (b*c * sqrt(30))/13 \u2192 b*c = (6*s *13)/sqrt(30) = (78*s)/sqrt(30)\n\nThen, using the formula for IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 \u2192 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 \u2192 (s - a)^2 = 120 \u2192 s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30)\n\nSince a = 4*sqrt(30), s = 4*sqrt(30) + 2*sqrt(30) = 6*sqrt(30)\n\nThen, substituting s into b*c = (78*s)/sqrt(30) \u2192 (78 * 6*sqrt(30))/sqrt(30) = 78*6 = 468.\n\nSo, all the steps check out, and the logic seems sound. I don't see any mistakes here.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) has a circumradius \\( R = 13 \\) and an inradius \\( r = 6 \\). The condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) implies that triangle \\( \\triangle IOA \\) is right-angled at \\( I \\). Using the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter, we have:\n\n\\[\nOI^2 = R(R - 2r) = 13(13 - 12) = 13\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( OI = \\sqrt{13} \\). In the right triangle \\( \\triangle IOA \\), applying the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\nIA^2 + OI^2 = OA^2 \\implies IA^2 + 13 = 13^2 = 169 \\implies IA^2 = 156 \\implies IA = 2\\sqrt{39}\n\\]\n\nUsing the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex, \\( IA = \\frac{r}{\\sin(A/2)} \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n2\\sqrt{39} = \\frac{6}{\\sin(A/2)} \\implies \\sin(A/2) = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{39}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{13}}\n\\]\n\nThe angle \\( A \\) can then be found using the double-angle identity:\n\n\\[\n\\sin A = 2 \\sin(A/2) \\cos(A/2) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{13}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{\\sqrt{13}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the semiperimeter \\( s \\) using the formula for the inradius:\n\n\\[\nIA^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2 \\implies 156 = 36 + (s - 4\\sqrt{30})^2 \\implies (s - 4\\sqrt{30})^2 = 120 \\implies s - 4\\sqrt{30} = 2\\sqrt{30} \\implies s = 6\\sqrt{30}\n\\]\n\nFinally, using the area formula and the relationship between sides and angles, we find:\n\n\\[\nb \\cdot c = \\frac{78s}{\\sqrt{30}} = \\frac{78 \\cdot 6\\sqrt{30}}{\\sqrt{30}} = 468\n\\]\n\nThus, the product \\( AB \\cdot AC \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{468}\n\\]",
