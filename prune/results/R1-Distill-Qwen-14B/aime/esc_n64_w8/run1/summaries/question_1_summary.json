      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)| given a system of logarithmic equations. Hmm, let's see. I remember that logarithms can be tricky, especially when dealing with multiple variables, but maybe I can simplify this by converting the log equations into exponential form. \n\nThe equations given are:\n\n1. log\u2082(x/(yz)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y/(xz)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z/(xy)) = 1/4\n\nI think the first step is to rewrite each equation in terms of exponents. That way, I can express x, y, and z in some relation to each other.\n\nStarting with the first equation: log\u2082(x/(yz)) = 1/2. Converting this to exponential form gives x/(yz) = 2^(1/2), which is sqrt(2). So, x = yz * sqrt(2). Let me write that down as equation (1a): x = yz\u221a2.\n\nMoving on to the second equation: log\u2082(y/(xz)) = 1/3. Converting that, y/(xz) = 2^(1/3). So, y = xz * 2^(1/3). That's equation (2a): y = xz * 2^(1/3).\n\nThird equation: log\u2082(z/(xy)) = 1/4. So, z/(xy) = 2^(1/4), which means z = xy * 2^(1/4). That's equation (3a): z = xy * 2^(1/4).\n\nNow, I have these three equations:\n\n1a. x = yz\u221a2\n2a. y = xz * 2^(1/3)\n3a. z = xy * 2^(1/4)\n\nHmm, these are all interdependent. Maybe I can substitute one into another to express everything in terms of a single variable. Let me see.\n\nLet's try substituting equation (1a) into equation (2a). From (1a), x = yz\u221a2. Plugging this into (2a):\n\ny = (yz\u221a2) * z * 2^(1/3)\n\nSimplify that:\n\ny = y z^2 \u221a2 * 2^(1/3)\n\nHmm, let's write the exponents as fractions for easier manipulation. So, \u221a2 is 2^(1/2), and 2^(1/3) is as it is.\n\nSo, y = y * z^2 * 2^(1/2 + 1/3)\n\nLet me compute the exponent: 1/2 + 1/3 is 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6. So, 2^(5/6).\n\nSo, y = y * z^2 * 2^(5/6)\n\nWait, if I divide both sides by y (assuming y \u2260 0, which it is positive, so that's fine), I get:\n\n1 = z^2 * 2^(5/6)\n\nSo, solving for z^2:\n\nz^2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nTaking square roots, since z is positive:\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check that exponent. Because z^2 is 2^(-5/6), so z is 2^(-5/12). That's correct because (2^(-5/12))\u00b2 = 2^(-5/6).\n\nSo, z = 2^(-5/12). Let me note this as equation (4): z = 2^(-5/12).\n\nGreat, now that I have z in terms of 2's exponents, maybe I can find x and y.\n\nLet me go back to equation (1a): x = yz\u221a2.\n\nI can express x in terms of y and z. Since I know z, perhaps I can express x in terms of y.\n\nWait, but I also have equation (3a): z = xy * 2^(1/4). Since I know z, I can plug that into (3a):\n\n2^(-5/12) = x y * 2^(1/4)\n\nSo, x y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) [since 1/4 is 3/12] = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3).\n\nSo, x y = 2^(-2/3). Let me call this equation (5): x y = 2^(-2/3).\n\nNow, from equation (1a): x = y z \u221a2. Since z is known, let's plug that in:\n\nx = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2) [because sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2)]\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(-5/12 + 6/12) [since 1/2 is 6/12] = y * 2^(1/12).\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12). Let me write this as equation (6): x = y * 2^(1/12).\n\nNow, I can substitute x from equation (6) into equation (5): x y = 2^(-2/3).\n\nSubstituting x:\n\n(y * 2^(1/12)) * y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nWhich simplifies to y\u00b2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nLet me write 2^(1/12) as 2^(1/12) and 2^(-2/3) as 2^(-8/12). So:\n\ny\u00b2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-8/12)\n\nDivide both sides by 2^(1/12):\n\ny\u00b2 = 2^(-8/12 - 1/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4), so y = 2^(-3/8), since y is positive.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8). Let me note this as equation (7): y = 2^(-3/8).\n\nNow, using equation (6): x = y * 2^(1/12). Substituting y from equation (7):\n\nx = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12)\n\nLet me compute the exponents. Convert to common denominator, which is 24.\n\n-3/8 = -9/24, and 1/12 = 2/24. So:\n\nx = 2^(-9/24 + 2/24) = 2^(-7/24)\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24). Equation (8): x = 2^(-7/24).\n\nSo, now I have expressions for x, y, z:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nWait, let me make sure these exponents are correct.\n\nLet me check equation (3a): z = xy * 2^(1/4). Let's compute x*y:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24). So x*y = 2^(-7/24 -9/24) = 2^(-16/24) = 2^(-2/3).\n\nMultiply by 2^(1/4) = 2^(6/24):\n\nz = 2^(-2/3 + 6/24) = 2^(-16/24 + 6/24) = 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-5/12). Which matches equation (4), so that's correct.\n\nGood, so all the substitutions seem to hold.\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|. Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, let's compute x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2.\n\nx = 2^(-7/24), so x\u2074 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)\n\ny = 2^(-3/8), so y\u00b3 = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)\n\nz = 2^(-5/12), so z\u00b2 = (2^(-5/12))\u00b2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nSo, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiply the exponents by adding them together:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nFirst, let's find a common denominator for these fractions. 6, 8, 6. The least common multiple is 24.\n\nConvert each term:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nAdding them together: -28 -27 -20 = -75. So, total exponent is -75/24.\n\nSimplify -75/24: both numerator and denominator can be divided by 3.\n\n75 \u00f73=25, 24 \u00f73=8. So, -25/8.\n\nSo, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8).\n\nSo, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nSince it's absolute value, | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo, the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms since 25 and 8 are coprime (no common factors besides 1).\n\nTherefore, m =25, n=8, so m +n = 33.\n\nWait, let me double-check all the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the substitution steps:\n\nFrom equation (1a), x = yz\u221a2. Then substituted into equation (2a): y = xz * 2^(1/3). Then x is yz\u221a2, so substitution gives y = y z^2 * sqrt(2) * 2^(1/3). Then exponents: sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so total exponent is 1/2 +1/3 = 5/6. So equation becomes y = y z^2 2^(5/6). Divide both sides by y: 1 = z^2 2^(5/6). So z^2 = 2^(-5/6), so z = 2^(-5/12). That's correct.\n\nThen equation (3a): z = xy * 2^(1/4). Plugging in z: 2^(-5/12) = xy 2^(1/4). So xy = 2^(-5/12 -1/4). 1/4 is 3/12, so exponents: -5/12 -3/12 = -8/12 = -2/3. So xy = 2^(-2/3). Correct.\n\nFrom equation (1a): x = yz\u221a2. Since z = 2^(-5/12), x = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2) = y * 2^(-5/12 +6/12)= y *2^(1/12). So equation (6): x = y*2^(1/12). Correct.\n\nThen equation (5): x y = 2^(-2/3). Substituting x = y *2^(1/12) gives (y *2^(1/12)) * y = y\u00b2 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3). So, y\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3 -1/12). Wait, hold on, in my previous steps, I think I messed up here.\n\nWait, in the calculation above, I had:\n\n(y * 2^(1/12)) * y = y\u00b2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3).\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 -1/12).\n\nWait, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 2/3 is 8/12, and 1/12 is 1/12. So exponent is -8/12 -1/12 = -9/12 = -3/4. So y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4). Therefore, y = 2^(-3/8). Correct.\n\nThen x = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12). Let's convert to 24 denominator:\n\n-3/8 = -9/24, 1/12 = 2/24. So total exponent: -9 +2 = -7/24. So x = 2^(-7/24). Correct.\n\nThen, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2:\n\nx\u2074 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)\n\ny\u00b3 = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)\n\nz\u00b2 = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nAdding exponents: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nTotal: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8. Correct.\n\nSo log\u2082 is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8. So m=25, n=8. m +n=33. \n\nYes, everything checks out. I think this is the correct answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)| given a system of logarithmic equations. Hmm, let's see. I remember that logarithms can be tricky, especially when dealing with multiple variables, but maybe I can simplify this by converting the log equations into exponential form. \n\nThe equations given are:\n\n1. log\u2082(x/(yz)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y/(xz)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z/(xy)) = 1/4\n\nI think the first step is to rewrite each equation in terms of exponents. That way, I can express x, y, and z in some relation to each other.\n\nStarting with the first equation: log\u2082(x/(yz)) = 1/2. Converting this to exponential form gives x/(yz) = 2^(1/2), which is sqrt(2). So, x = yz * sqrt(2). Let me write that down as equation (1a): x = yz\u221a2.\n\nMoving on to the second equation: log\u2082(y/(xz)) = 1/3. Converting that, y/(xz) = 2^(1/3). So, y = xz * 2^(1/3). That's equation (2a): y = xz * 2^(1/3).\n\nThird equation: log\u2082(z/(xy)) = 1/4. So, z/(xy) = 2^(1/4), which means z = xy * 2^(1/4). That's equation (3a): z = xy * 2^(1/4).\n\nNow, I have these three equations:\n\n1a. x = yz\u221a2\n2a. y = xz * 2^(1/3)\n3a. z = xy * 2^(1/4)\n\nHmm, these are all interdependent. Maybe I can substitute one into another to express everything in terms of a single variable. Let me see.\n\nLet's try substituting equation (1a) into equation (2a). From (1a), x = yz\u221a2. Plugging this into (2a):\n\ny = (yz\u221a2) * z * 2^(1/3)\n\nSimplify that:\n\ny = y z^2 \u221a2 * 2^(1/3)\n\nHmm, let's write the exponents as fractions for easier manipulation. So, \u221a2 is 2^(1/2), and 2^(1/3) is as it is.\n\nSo, y = y * z^2 * 2^(1/2 + 1/3)\n\nLet me compute the exponent: 1/2 + 1/3 is 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6. So, 2^(5/6).\n\nSo, y = y * z^2 * 2^(5/6)\n\nWait, if I divide both sides by y (assuming y \u2260 0, which it is positive, so that's fine), I get:\n\n1 = z^2 * 2^(5/6)\n\nSo, solving for z^2:\n\nz^2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nTaking square roots, since z is positive:\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check that exponent. Because z^2 is 2^(-5/6), so z is 2^(-5/12). That's correct because (2^(-5/12))\u00b2 = 2^(-5/6).\n\nSo, z = 2^(-5/12). Let me note this as equation (4): z = 2^(-5/12).\n\nGreat, now that I have z in terms of 2's exponents, maybe I can find x and y.\n\nLet me go back to equation (1a): x = yz\u221a2.\n\nI can express x in terms of y and z. Since I know z, perhaps I can express x in terms of y.\n\nWait, but I also have equation (3a): z = xy * 2^(1/4). Since I know z, I can plug that into (3a):\n\n2^(-5/12) = x y * 2^(1/4)\n\nSo, x y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) [since 1/4 is 3/12] = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3).\n\nSo, x y = 2^(-2/3). Let me call this equation (5): x y = 2^(-2/3).\n\nNow, from equation (1a): x = y z \u221a2. Since z is known, let's plug that in:\n\nx = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2) [because sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2)]\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(-5/12 + 6/12) [since 1/2 is 6/12] = y * 2^(1/12).\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12). Let me write this as equation (6): x = y * 2^(1/12).\n\nNow, I can substitute x from equation (6) into equation (5): x y = 2^(-2/3).\n\nSubstituting x:\n\n(y * 2^(1/12)) * y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nWhich simplifies to y\u00b2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nLet me write 2^(1/12) as 2^(1/12) and 2^(-2/3) as 2^(-8/12). So:\n\ny\u00b2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-8/12)\n\nDivide both sides by 2^(1/12):\n\ny\u00b2 = 2^(-8/12 - 1/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4), so y = 2^(-3/8), since y is positive.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8). Let me note this as equation (7): y = 2^(-3/8).\n\nNow, using equation (6): x = y * 2^(1/12). Substituting y from equation (7):\n\nx = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12)\n\nLet me compute the exponents. Convert to common denominator, which is 24.\n\n-3/8 = -9/24, and 1/12 = 2/24. So:\n\nx = 2^(-9/24 + 2/24) = 2^(-7/24)\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24). Equation (8): x = 2^(-7/24).\n\nSo, now I have expressions for x, y, z:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nWait, let me make sure these exponents are correct.\n\nLet me check equation (3a): z = xy * 2^(1/4). Let's compute x*y:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24). So x*y = 2^(-7/24 -9/24) = 2^(-16/24) = 2^(-2/3).\n\nMultiply by 2^(1/4) = 2^(6/24):\n\nz = 2^(-2/3 + 6/24) = 2^(-16/24 + 6/24) = 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-5/12). Which matches equation (4), so that's correct.\n\nGood, so all the substitutions seem to hold.\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|. Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, let's compute x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2.\n\nx = 2^(-7/24), so x\u2074 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)\n\ny = 2^(-3/8), so y\u00b3 = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)\n\nz = 2^(-5/12), so z\u00b2 = (2^(-5/12))\u00b2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nSo, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiply the exponents by adding them together:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nFirst, let's find a common denominator for these fractions. 6, 8, 6. The least common multiple is 24.\n\nConvert each term:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nAdding them together: -28 -27 -20 = -75. So, total exponent is -75/24.\n\nSimplify -75/24: both numerator and denominator can be divided by 3.\n\n75 \u00f73=25, 24 \u00f73=8. So, -25/8.\n\nSo, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8).\n\nSo, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nSince it's absolute value, | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo, the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms since 25 and 8 are coprime (no common factors besides 1).\n\nTherefore, m =25, n=8, so m +n = 33.\n\nWait, let me double-check all the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the substitution steps:\n\nFrom equation (1a), x = yz\u221a2. Then substituted into equation (2a): y = xz * 2^(1/3). Then x is yz\u221a2, so substitution gives y = y z^2 * sqrt(2) * 2^(1/3). Then exponents: sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so total exponent is 1/2 +1/3 = 5/6. So equation becomes y = y z^2 2^(5/6). Divide both sides by y: 1 = z^2 2^(5/6). So z^2 = 2^(-5/6), so z = 2^(-5/12). That's correct.\n\nThen equation (3a): z = xy * 2^(1/4). Plugging in z: 2^(-5/12) = xy 2^(1/4). So xy = 2^(-5/12 -1/4). 1/4 is 3/12, so exponents: -5/12 -3/12 = -8/12 = -2/3. So xy = 2^(-2/3). Correct.\n\nFrom equation (1a): x = yz\u221a2. Since z = 2^(-5/12), x = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2) = y * 2^(-5/12 +6/12)= y *2^(1/12). So equation (6): x = y*2^(1/12). Correct.\n\nThen equation (5): x y = 2^(-2/3). Substituting x = y *2^(1/12) gives (y *2^(1/12)) * y = y\u00b2 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3). So, y\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3 -1/12). Wait, hold on, in my previous steps, I think I messed up here.\n\nWait, in the calculation above, I had:\n\n(y * 2^(1/12)) * y = y\u00b2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3).\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 -1/12).\n\nWait, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 2/3 is 8/12, and 1/12 is 1/12. So exponent is -8/12 -1/12 = -9/12 = -3/4. So y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4). Therefore, y = 2^(-3/8). Correct.\n\nThen x = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12). Let's convert to 24 denominator:\n\n-3/8 = -9/24, 1/12 = 2/24. So total exponent: -9 +2 = -7/24. So x = 2^(-7/24). Correct.\n\nThen, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2:\n\nx\u2074 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)\n\ny\u00b3 = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)\n\nz\u00b2 = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nAdding exponents: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nTotal: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8. Correct.\n\nSo log\u2082 is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8. So m=25, n=8. m +n=33. \n\nYes, everything checks out. I think this is the correct answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by converting the given logarithmic equations into exponential form:\n\n1. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\) implies \\(\\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \\sqrt{2}\\), so \\(x = yz\\sqrt{2}\\).\n2. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\) implies \\(\\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\\), so \\(y = xz \\cdot 2^{1/3}\\).\n3. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\) implies \\(\\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\\), so \\(z = xy \\cdot 2^{1/4}\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(x = yz\\sqrt{2}\\) into \\(y = xz \\cdot 2^{1/3}\\), we get:\n\\[ y = (yz\\sqrt{2}) \\cdot z \\cdot 2^{1/3} \\]\n\\[ y = y z^2 \\cdot 2^{1/2 + 1/3} \\]\n\\[ 1 = z^2 \\cdot 2^{5/6} \\]\n\\[ z^2 = 2^{-5/6} \\]\n\\[ z = 2^{-5/12} \\]\n\nUsing \\(z = 2^{-5/12}\\) in \\(z = xy \\cdot 2^{1/4}\\):\n\\[ 2^{-5/12} = xy \\cdot 2^{1/4} \\]\n\\[ xy = 2^{-5/12 - 1/4} = 2^{-2/3} \\]\n\nFrom \\(x = yz\\sqrt{2}\\), substituting \\(z\\):\n\\[ x = y \\cdot 2^{-5/12} \\cdot 2^{1/2} = y \\cdot 2^{-5/12 + 6/12} = y \\cdot 2^{1/12} \\]\nThus, \\(x = y \\cdot 2^{1/12}\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(x = y \\cdot 2^{1/12}\\) into \\(xy = 2^{-2/3}\\):\n\\[ (y \\cdot 2^{1/12}) \\cdot y = 2^{-2/3} \\]\n\\[ y^2 \\cdot 2^{1/12} = 2^{-2/3} \\]\n\\[ y^2 = 2^{-2/3 - 1/12} = 2^{-3/4} \\]\n\\[ y = 2^{-3/8} \\]\n\nThen, \\(x = y \\cdot 2^{1/12} = 2^{-3/8} \\cdot 2^{1/12} = 2^{-7/24}\\).\n\nNow, compute \\(x^4 y^3 z^2\\):\n\\[ x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-7/6} \\]\n\\[ y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8} \\]\n\\[ z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-5/6} \\]\n\nAdding exponents:\n\\[ -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6 = -28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = -75/24 = -25/8 \\]\nThus, \\(x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-25/8}\\).\n\nTaking the logarithm:\n\\[ \\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \\log_2(2^{-25/8}) = -25/8 \\]\nThe absolute value is \\(25/8\\), so \\(m = 25\\), \\(n = 8\\), and \\(m + n = 33\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{33}\\)",

Substitute that into equation A:\n\n(2^(1/12) y) * y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo 2^(1/12) * y\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3)\n\nDivide both sides by 2^(1/12):\n\ny\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 - 1/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nSo y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4) \u21d2 y = 2^(-3/8) since y is positive.\n\nNow that I have y, I can find x from equation B.\n\nx = 2^(1/12) * y = 2^(1/12) * 2^(-3/8) = 2^(1/12 - 3/8)\n\nConvert to common denominators: 1/12 is 2/24, 3/8 is 9/24.\n\nSo 2^(2/24 - 9/24) = 2^(-7/24)\n\nSo x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nAnd we already have z = 2^(-5/12)\n\nSo now, let's write all variables in terms of exponents:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nNow, I need to compute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)\n\nLet me compute the exponents first:\n\nx\u2074 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/24 *4) = 2^(-7/6)\ny\u00b3 = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)\nz\u00b2 = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiply them together:\n\nx\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)\n\nAdd the exponents:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nLet me find a common denominator. 6 and 8 have LCD of 24.\n\nConvert each fraction:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n-9/8 = -27/24\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nAdding them together: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify: -75/24 = -25/8\n\nSo x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8)\n\nTherefore, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8\n\nBut the problem asks for the absolute value, so | -25/8 | = 25/8\n\nSo m =25, n=8. They are coprime.\n\nSo m +n=25+8=33.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for x, y, z:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24), y=2^(-3/8), z=2^(-5/12)\n\nCheck x\u2074: exponent is 4*(-7/24) = -7/6\n\ny\u00b3: 3*(-3/8) = -9/8\n\nz\u00b2: 2*(-5/12) = -5/6\n\nSum: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nConvert to 24ths:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nTotal: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8\n\nSo log\u2082(...) is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the answer is 25/8, so m +n=33.\n\n\nTo solve the given system of logarithmic equations, we first convert each equation into its exponential form:\n\n1. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\) implies \\(\\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \\sqrt{2}\\).\n2. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\) implies \\(\\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\\).\n3. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\) implies \\(\\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\\).\n\nRewriting these, we have:\n1. \\(x = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot yz\\)\n2. \\(y = 2^{1/3} \\cdot xz\\)\n3. \\(z = 2^{1/4} \\cdot xy\\)\n\nSubstituting \\(x\\) from the first equation into the second, we get:\n\\[y = 2^{1/3} \\cdot (\\sqrt{2} \\cdot yz) \\cdot z = 2^{5/6} \\cdot y \\cdot z^2\\]\nDividing both sides by \\(y\\), we find:\n\\[1 = 2^{5/6} \\cdot z^2 \\implies z^2 = 2^{-5/6} \\implies z = 2^{-5/12}\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(z\\) back into the third equation:\n\\[2^{-5/12} = 2^{1/4} \\cdot x \\cdot y \\implies xy = 2^{-2/3}\\]\n\nFrom the first equation, \\(x = 2^{1/12} \\cdot y\\). Substituting this into \\(xy = 2^{-2/3}\\):\n\\[2^{1/12} \\cdot y^2 = 2^{-2/3} \\implies y^2 = 2^{-2/3 - 1/12} = 2^{-3/4} \\implies y = 2^{-3/8}\\]\n\nThen, \\(x = 2^{1/12} \\cdot 2^{-3/8} = 2^{-7/24}\\).\n\nNow, we compute \\(\\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx^4 &= (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-7/6}, \\\\\ny^3 &= (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8}, \\\\\nz^2 &= (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-5/6}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nMultiplying these together:\n\\[\nx^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6} = 2^{-25/8}.\n\\]\nThus, \\(\\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -\\frac{25}{8}\\), and its absolute value is \\(\\frac{25}{8}\\).\n\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{25}{8}\\) has \\(m = 25\\) and \\(n = 8\\), which are coprime.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Then, I have to find m + n. The given system involves three logarithmic equations. Hmm, let me write them down to see clearly.\n\nThe equations are:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nI remember that logarithms can be converted to exponents. So, if log_b(a) = c, then a = b^c. Let me apply that to each equation.\n\nStarting with the first equation: log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2. That means x / (y z) = 2^(1/2), which is the square root of 2, or \u221a2. So, x = y z * \u221a2.\n\nSimilarly, the second equation: log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3. So, y / (x z) = 2^(1/3). Therefore, y = x z * 2^(1/3).\n\nThird equation: log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4. So, z / (x y) = 2^(1/4). Hence, z = x y * 2^(1/4).\n\nNow, I have expressions for x, y, z in terms of each other. Maybe I can substitute these into each other to find a relationship between x, y, z.\n\nLet me denote the equations as:\n\nx = y z \u221a2  -- (1)\n\ny = x z 2^(1/3) -- (2)\n\nz = x y 2^(1/4) -- (3)\n\nI need to express all variables in terms of one variable or find a way to combine these equations.\n\nLet me try substituting equation (2) into equation (1). So, equation (1) becomes:\n\nx = (x z 2^(1/3)) * z * \u221a2\n\nSimplify that:\n\nx = x z^2 2^(1/3) * \u221a2\n\nHmm, I can divide both sides by x (since x is positive, it can't be zero), so:\n\n1 = z^2 2^(1/3 + 1/2)\n\nWait, because \u221a2 is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2). Let me compute that exponent:\n\n1/3 + 1/2 = (2 + 3)/6 = 5/6. So,\n\n1 = z^2 * 2^(5/6)\n\nTherefore, z^2 = 1 / 2^(5/6)\n\nTaking square roots, since z is positive:\n\nz = 1 / 2^(5/12)\n\nWait, because 2^(5/6) is (2^(1/12))^5, so 1 over that is 2^(-5/6). Hmm, maybe I should write it as 2^(-5/12) when taking square root? Wait, no.\n\nWait, z^2 = 2^(-5/6), so z = (2^(-5/6))^(1/2) = 2^(-5/12). So, z = 2^(-5/12). Got it.\n\nNow, let's note that down: z = 2^(-5/12)\n\nNow, let me plug this back into equation (3) to find y.\n\nEquation (3): z = x y 2^(1/4)\n\nSo, 2^(-5/12) = x y 2^(1/4)\n\nLet me solve for x y:\n\nx y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, x y = 2^(-2/3) -- let's call this equation (4).\n\nNow, let me look at equation (2): y = x z 2^(1/3)\n\nWe know z is 2^(-5/12), so:\n\ny = x * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3)\n\nSimplify the exponents: 2^(-5/12 + 4/12) since 1/3 is 4/12.\n\nWait, 1/3 is 4/12, so:\n\n-5/12 + 4/12 = (-1)/12. So, y = x * 2^(-1/12)\n\nSo, y = x * 2^(-1/12) -- equation (5)\n\nNow, from equation (4), x y = 2^(-2/3). Substitute y from equation (5):\n\nx * (x * 2^(-1/12)) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nWhich is x^2 * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, x^2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3 + 1/12)\n\nConvert -2/3 to -8/12, so -8/12 + 1/12 = -7/12.\n\nThus, x^2 = 2^(-7/12), so x = 2^(-7/24) since square root is exponent 1/2.\n\nWait, 2^(-7/12) is (2^(-7/24))^2, so x = 2^(-7/24).\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nNow, from equation (5), y = x * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-2/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8)\n\nWait, let me check that exponent:\n\n-7/24 - 1/12. Since 1/12 is 2/24, so -7/24 -2/24 = -9/24, which simplifies to -3/8. So, y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nSo, now we have:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\n\ny = 2^(-3/8)\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x^4 y^3 z^2)|. Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, let's compute the exponent inside the log:\n\nx^4 y^3 z^2\n\nSince x, y, z are powers of 2, we can express this as:\n\n(2^(-7/24))^4 * (2^(-3/8))^3 * (2^(-5/12))^2\n\nMultiply the exponents:\n\nFor x^4: (-7/24) *4 = -7/6\n\nFor y^3: (-3/8)*3 = -9/8\n\nFor z^2: (-5/12)*2 = -5/6\n\nNow, add all exponents together:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nLet me find a common denominator. 6,8,6. The least common multiple is 24.\n\nConvert each fraction:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nSo, adding them:\n\n-28/24 -27/24 -20/24 = (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify: -75/24 can be reduced. Divided by 3: -25/8.\n\nSo, the exponent is -25/8, so x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-25/8)\n\nTherefore, log\u2082(x^4 y^3 z^2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8\n\nTaking the absolute value, | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo, the value is 25/8. Therefore, m =25, n=8. They are coprime since 25 and 8 share no common divisors besides 1.\n\nSo, m + n = 25 +8=33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{33}\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)| given a system of logarithmic equations. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem gives me three equations:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nI remember that log\u2082(a/b) = log\u2082a - log\u2082b. So maybe I can rewrite each equation using this property. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\nlog\u2082(x) - log\u2082(y) - log\u2082(z) = 1/2\n\nSecond equation:\nlog\u2082(y) - log\u2082(x) - log\u2082(z) = 1/3\n\nThird equation:\nlog\u2082(z) - log\u2082(x) - log\u2082(y) = 1/4\n\nHmm, okay, so now I have a system of three equations with three variables: log\u2082x, log\u2082y, log\u2082z. Let me denote these as variables to make it easier. Let's let a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z. Then the equations become:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nSo now I have a system:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nI need to solve for a, b, c. Then, once I have those, I can compute log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) as 4a + 3b + 2c, since log\u2082(x\u2074) = 4 log\u2082x, etc. The absolute value is just in case the result is negative, but I don't think it will be here because x, y, z are positive reals, so their logs should be real numbers, but maybe not necessarily positive. Wait, but the system could lead to some logs being negative. Hmm, I'll keep that in mind.\n\nSo, to solve the system:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nI can try adding all three equations together to see if something simplifies.\n\nAdding left sides: (a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = Let's compute each term:\n\na -a -a = -a\n\n-b + b - b = -b\n\n-c -c + c = -c\n\nSo total left side: -a - b - c\n\nRight sides: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Let me compute that. The common denominator is 12.\n\n1/2 = 6/12, 1/3 = 4/12, 1/4 = 3/12. So total is 6+4+3=13/12.\n\nSo equation becomes: -a - b - c = 13/12\n\nWait, but that's - (a + b + c) = 13/12 => a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nHmm, okay, that's one equation: a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nBut I have three equations. Maybe I can use this with the individual equations.\n\nLet me write down the four equations I have now:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nEquation 4: a + b + c = -13/12\n\nMaybe I can solve this system by elimination.\n\nLet me try to express a, b, c in terms of each other.\n\nFrom Equation 1: a = 1/2 + b + c\n\nPlugging this into Equation 4: (1/2 + b + c) + b + c = -13/12\n\nSimplify: 1/2 + 2b + 2c = -13/12\n\nMultiply everything by 12 to eliminate denominators:\n\n6 + 24b + 24c = -13\n\n24b + 24c = -13 -6 = -19\n\nDivide both sides by 24:\n\nb + c = -19/24\n\nLet me note that as Equation 5: b + c = -19/24\n\nSimilarly, from Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nAgain, using a = 1/2 + b + c from Equation 1:\n\nSubstitute into Equation 2: -(1/2 + b + c) + b - c = 1/3\n\nSimplify: -1/2 - b - c + b - c = 1/3\n\nThe b terms cancel: -1/2 -2c = 1/3\n\nSo, -2c = 1/3 + 1/2 = (2 + 3)/6 = 5/6\n\nThus, c = -5/(6*2) = -5/12\n\nSo c = -5/12. That's one variable found.\n\nFrom Equation 5: b + c = -19/24, so b = -19/24 - c\n\nSubstitute c = -5/12:\n\nb = -19/24 - (-5/12) = -19/24 + 5/12 = -19/24 + 10/24 = (-19 +10)/24 = (-9)/24 = -3/8\n\nSo b = -3/8.\n\nNow, from Equation 1: a = 1/2 + b + c\n\nSubstitute b and c:\n\na = 1/2 + (-3/8) + (-5/12)\n\nFirst, let's find a common denominator for the fractions. 1/2 is 12/24, -3/8 is -9/24, -5/12 is -10/24.\n\nSo adding them: 12/24 -9/24 -10/24 = (12 -9 -10)/24 = (-7)/24.\n\nSo a = -7/24.\n\nSo now I have a, b, c:\n\na = log\u2082x = -7/24\n\nb = log\u2082y = -3/8\n\nc = log\u2082z = -5/12\n\nNow, I need to compute log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = 4a + 3b + 2c.\n\nLet me calculate each term:\n\n4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6\n\n3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8\n\n2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6\n\nSo add them all together:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nFirst, let me combine the fractions with denominator 6:\n\n-7/6 -5/6 = (-7 -5)/6 = -12/6 = -2\n\nSo now, it's -2 -9/8.\n\nConvert -2 to eighths: -16/8\n\nSo -16/8 -9/8 = (-16 -9)/8 = -25/8\n\nSo log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = -25/8\n\nThe absolute value of that is 25/8.\n\nSo |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)| = 25/8.\n\n25 and 8 are coprime, so m=25, n=8, m+n=33.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)| given a system of logarithmic equations. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that x, y, and z are positive real numbers. That's good because logarithms are only defined for positive numbers, so I don't have to worry about undefined expressions here.\n\nThe system of equations given is:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nAnd I need to find |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|, which simplifies to |4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z|. So, if I can find log\u2082x, log\u2082y, and log\u2082z individually, I can plug them into this expression and compute the result.\n\nLet me denote a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, and c = log\u2082z. This substitution might make the equations easier to handle.\n\nSo, rewriting the given equations using these variables:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n   Using logarithm properties, this becomes log\u2082x - log\u2082y - log\u2082z = 1/2\n   Which translates to a - b - c = 1/2.\n\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n   Similarly, this is log\u2082y - log\u2082x - log\u2082z = 1/3\n   So, b - a - c = 1/3.\n\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n   This becomes log\u2082z - log\u2082x - log\u2082y = 1/4\n   Which is c - a - b = 1/4.\n\nNow, I have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nLet me write these equations again for clarity:\n\nEquation (1): a - b - c = 1/2\nEquation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3\nEquation (3): -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nI need to solve this system. Maybe I can add all three equations together to see if that helps.\n\nAdding equation (1), (2), and (3):\n\n(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\na - b - c - a + b - c -a - b + c\nCombine like terms:\n\na terms: a - a - a = -a\nb terms: -b + b - b = -b\nc terms: -c - c + c = -c\n\nSo overall, -a - b - c = sum of the right side.\n\nCompute the right side:\n\n1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Let me find a common denominator, which is 12.\n\n1/2 = 6/12\n1/3 = 4/12\n1/4 = 3/12\nTotal: 6 + 4 + 3 = 13 \u2192 13/12.\n\nSo, left side is - (a + b + c) = 13/12 \u2192 a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nHmm, but I need to find a, b, c individually. Let me think about how to proceed.\n\nI have three equations and the sum of a + b + c. Maybe I can express each variable in terms of the sum.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nNow, let's look at the individual equations again.\n\nEquation (1): a - b - c = 1/2\nWe can write this as a - (b + c) = 1/2.\n\nBut since S = a + b + c = -13/12, then b + c = S - a = (-13/12) - a.\n\nSubstituting into Equation (1):\n\na - [(-13/12) - a] = 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na + 13/12 + a = 1/2\n2a + 13/12 = 1/2\n\nSubtract 13/12 from both sides:\n\n2a = 1/2 - 13/12\n\nConvert 1/2 to 6/12:\n\n2a = 6/12 - 13/12 = (-7)/12\n\nSo, 2a = -7/12 \u2192 a = (-7)/24.\n\nOkay, so a = -7/24.\n\nSimilarly, let's try Equation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nAgain, express in terms of S.\n\nEquation (2): -a + (b - c) = 1/3\n\nBut S = a + b + c = -13/12, so b - c = (b + c) - 2c. Hmm, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's express b - c from Equation (2):\n\nFrom Equation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nBut from S = a + b + c = -13/12, we can express b + c = -13/12 - a.\n\nWait, but in Equation (2), we have b - c, which is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express variables in terms of S.\n\nLet me think: Let's subtract Equation (2) from Equation (1).\n\nEquation (1): a - b - c = 1/2\n\nEquation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nSubtract Equation (2) from Equation (1):\n\n(a - (-a)) + (-b - b) + (-c - (-c)) = 1/2 - 1/3\n\nCompute:\n\n2a - 2b + 0 = (3/6 - 2/6) = 1/6\n\nSo, 2a - 2b = 1/6 \u2192 a - b = 1/12.\n\nWe already have a = -7/24, so let's plug that in:\n\n(-7/24) - b = 1/12 \u2192 -b = 1/12 + 7/24.\n\nConvert 1/12 to 2/24:\n\n-b = 2/24 + 7/24 = 9/24 = 3/8.\n\nSo, b = -3/8.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd because b is log\u2082y, and y is a positive real number. So, log\u2082y can be negative, meaning y is between 0 and 1. That's acceptable.\n\nSo, b = -3/8.\n\nNow, let's find c.\n\nFrom S = a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nWe have a = -7/24, b = -3/8.\n\nConvert all to 24 denominators:\n\na = -7/24\n\nb = -3/8 = -9/24\n\nSo, a + b = (-7 -9)/24 = -16/24 = -2/3.\n\nThen, S = a + b + c = (-2/3) + c = -13/12.\n\nSo, c = (-13/12) + (2/3) \u2192 2/3 is 8/12, so:\n\nc = (-13/12) + 8/12 = (-5)/12.\n\nSo, c = -5/12.\n\nSo now, we have:\n\na = -7/24\n\nb = -3/8\n\nc = -5/12\n\nNow, let's verify these values in the original equations to make sure.\n\nEquation (1): a - b - c = (-7/24) - (-3/8) - (-5/12)\n\nConvert all to 24 denominator:\n\n-7/24 + 9/24 + 10/24 = ( -7 + 9 +10 ) /24 = 12/24 = 1/2. Correct.\n\nEquation (2): -a + b - c = -(-7/24) + (-3/8) - (-5/12)\n\n= 7/24 - 9/24 + 10/24 = (7 -9 +10)/24 = 8/24 = 1/3. Correct.\n\nEquation (3): -a - b + c = -(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12)\n\n=7/24 + 9/24 -10/24 = (7 +9 -10)/24 =6/24=1/4. Correct.\n\nGreat, all equations are satisfied.\n\nNow, the expression we need is |4a + 3b + 2c|.\n\nCompute 4a +3b +2c:\n\n4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6\n\n3b =3*(-3/8)= -9/8\n\n2c=2*(-5/12)= -10/12= -5/6\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nFirst, combine the fractions with denominator 6:\n\n-7/6 -5/6 = (-12)/6 = -2.\n\nSo, total is -2 -9/8.\n\nConvert -2 to -16/8:\n\n-16/8 -9/8 = (-25)/8.\n\nSo, 4a +3b +2c = -25/8.\n\nTaking absolute value: | -25/8 | =25/8.\n\nSo, the value is 25/8, which is already in reduced form since 25 and 8 are coprime (their GCD is 1).\n\nSo, m=25, n=8. Therefore, m +n=25+8=33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{33}\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here with three variables x, y, z, all positive real numbers. They satisfy a system of three logarithmic equations. I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.\n\nHmm, let's write down the equations first to get a clear picture.\n\nThe equations are:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nSo, these are logarithms base 2. Since logs can be tricky, maybe I can convert these into exponential form to make them easier to handle.\n\nRemember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.\n\nApplying that here:\n\n1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)\n2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)\n3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)\n\nSo, that gives me three equations:\n\n1. x = 2^(1/2) * y z\n2. y = 2^(1/3) * x z\n3. z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nHmm, these are nonlinear equations because x, y, z are multiplied together. Maybe I can express each variable in terms of the others and substitute.\n\nLet me denote 2^(1/2) as sqrt(2), 2^(1/3) as cube root of 2, and 2^(1/4) as fourth root of 2 for simplicity.\n\nSo, equation 1: x = sqrt(2) * y z\n\nEquation 2: y = (2^(1/3)) * x z\n\nEquation 3: z = (2^(1/4)) * x y\n\nHmm, perhaps I can substitute x from equation 1 into equation 2.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = sqrt(2) * y z.\n\nPlug this into equation 2:\n\ny = (2^(1/3)) * (sqrt(2) * y z) * z\n\nSimplify that:\n\ny = (2^(1/3) * sqrt(2)) * y z^2\n\nWait, let me write sqrt(2) as 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6)\n\nSo, y = 2^(5/6) * y * z^2\n\nHmm, so y cancels out on both sides, assuming y \u2260 0, which it isn't because it's positive.\n\nSo, 1 = 2^(5/6) * z^2\n\nThus, z^2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nTaking square root, z = 2^(-5/12) because sqrt(2^(-5/6)) is 2^(-5/12).\n\nWait, let me confirm that exponent:\n\nsqrt(2^(-5/6)) is 2^(-5/6 * 1/2) = 2^(-5/12). Yes, correct.\n\nSo, z = 2^(-5/12).\n\nOkay, so now I have z in terms of exponents. Let me write that down.\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nNow, let me try to find another variable. Maybe plug z back into equation 3 to find x or y.\n\nWait, equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * x y.\n\nWe know z is 2^(-5/12), so:\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nLet me write 2^(1/4) as 2^(3/12) so that denominators can be consistent.\n\nSo, 2^(-5/12) = 2^(3/12) * x y\n\nDivide both sides by 2^(3/12):\n\n2^(-5/12) / 2^(3/12) = x y\n\nWhich is 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = x y => 2^(-8/12) = x y => 2^(-2/3) = x y.\n\nSo, x y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nHmm, so now I have x y = 2^(-2/3). Let's see if I can find another relation.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = sqrt(2) * y z\n\nWe know z is 2^(-5/12), and sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2) which is 2^(6/12). So, sqrt(2) * z = 2^(6/12) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/12).\n\nSo, equation 1: x = 2^(1/12) * y\n\nSo, x = 2^(1/12) * y.\n\nNow, since x y = 2^(-2/3), substitute x from above into this.\n\nSo, (2^(1/12) * y) * y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nWhich is 2^(1/12) * y^2 = 2^(-2/3)\n\nDivide both sides by 2^(1/12):\n\ny^2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 - 1/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nSo, y^2 = 2^(-3/4), so y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nWait, because square root of 2^(-3/4) is 2^(-3/8). Correct.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nNow, since x = 2^(1/12) * y, plug y in:\n\nx = 2^(1/12) * 2^(-3/8) = 2^(1/12 - 3/8)\n\nConvert to common denominator, 24.\n\n1/12 is 2/24, 3/8 is 9/24. So, 2/24 - 9/24 = -7/24.\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check:\n\n1/12 = 2/24, 3/8 = 9/24. So, 2/24 - 9/24 = -7/24. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nSo, now we have x, y, z:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\n\ny = 2^(-3/8)\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.\n\nSo, let's compute x^4 y^3 z^2.\n\nCompute each exponent:\n\nx^4 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/24 * 4) = 2^(-7/6)\n\ny^3 = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)\n\nz^2 = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-5/6)\n\nSo, x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)\n\nAdd the exponents:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nLet me find a common denominator, which is 24.\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nSo, total exponent: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify: -75/24 can be reduced by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -25/8.\n\nSo, x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-25/8)\n\nTherefore, log\u2082(x^4 y^3 z^2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nThe absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo, m = 25, n = 8. They are coprime since 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1.\n\nThus, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Converted each log equation to exponential form correctly.\n\n2. Substituted x from equation 1 into equation 2, correctly simplified exponents.\n\n3. Solved for z, getting z = 2^(-5/12). That seems correct.\n\n4. Plugged z into equation 3 to find x y = 2^(-2/3). Correct.\n\n5. Then used equation 1 again to express x in terms of y, substituted into x y = 2^(-2/3), solved for y, getting y = 2^(-3/8). Correct.\n\n6. Then found x as 2^(-7/24). Correct.\n\n7. Then computed x^4, y^3, z^2, added exponents correctly.\n\nWait, let me check the exponents again.\n\nx^4: exponent is (-7/24)*4 = -7/6\n\ny^3: exponent is (-3/8)*3 = -9/8\n\nz^2: exponent is (-5/12)*2 = -5/6\n\nSum: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nConvert to 24ths:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nTotal: (-28 -27 -20) = -75, so -75/24 = -25/8. Correct.\n\nSo, log is -25/8, absolute value 25/8. So, m + n is 33.\n\nI think that's solid.\n",

Hmm, let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the equations are:\n\n1. log\u2082(x/(yz)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y/(xz)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z/(xy)) = 1/4\n\nI remember that log\u2082(a/b) = log\u2082a - log\u2082b. So maybe I can rewrite each equation using that property.\n\nLet me rewrite each equation:\n\n1. log\u2082x - log\u2082y - log\u2082z = 1/2\n2. log\u2082y - log\u2082x - log\u2082z = 1/3\n3. log\u2082z - log\u2082x - log\u2082y = 1/4\n\nHmm, okay. So now I have three equations with variables log\u2082x, log\u2082y, and log\u2082z. Maybe I can let a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z. That should simplify things.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nNow I have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c. I can solve this system.\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2  --> Equation (1)\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3 --> Equation (2)\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4 --> Equation (3)\n\nI can try adding all three equations together to see if that helps. Let's add them:\n\n(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\na - b - c - a + b - c - a - b + c\nLet me compute term by term:\n\na - a - a = -a\n\n-b + b - b = -b\n\n-c - c + c = -c\n\nSo altogether: -a - b - c\n\nRight side: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Let me find a common denominator, which is 12.\n\n1/2 = 6/12, 1/3 = 4/12, 1/4 = 3/12. So 6 + 4 + 3 = 13/12.\n\nSo the sum of the equations gives: -a - b - c = 13/12\n\nWhich can be written as: a + b + c = -13/12\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Now, I can use this result to find a, b, c individually.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nNow, let's go back to the individual equations.\n\nEquation (1): a - b - c = 1/2\n\nBut from S, a = S - b - c.\n\nWait, let's see. Alternatively, perhaps I can express each variable in terms of S.\n\nWait, let me think of another approach. Let's express each equation in terms of S.\n\nEquation (1): a - b - c = 1/2\n\nBut since a + b + c = S, I can write a = S - b - c.\n\nSubstituting into Equation (1):\n\n(S - b - c) - b - c = 1/2\n\nSimplify: S - 2b - 2c = 1/2\n\nBut S is -13/12, so:\n\n-13/12 - 2b - 2c = 1/2\n\nLet me solve for 2b + 2c:\n\n-2b -2c = 1/2 +13/12\n\nConvert 1/2 to 6/12, so 6/12 +13/12=19/12\n\nSo, -2(b + c) = 19/12\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\nb + c = (19/12)/(-2) = -19/24\n\nSimilarly, let's do the same for Equation (2):\n\nEquation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nAgain, since a = S - b - c, substitute:\n\n-(S - b - c) + b - c = 1/3\n\nExpand: -S + b + c + b - c =1/3\n\nSimplify: -S + 2b =1/3\n\nWe know S is -13/12, so:\n\n-(-13/12) + 2b =1/3\n\nWhich is 13/12 + 2b =1/3\n\nSubtract 13/12 from both sides:\n\n2b = 1/3 -13/12\n\nConvert 1/3 to 4/12, so 4/12 -13/12 = -9/12 = -3/4\n\nSo, 2b = -3/4 => b= -3/8\n\nOkay, so b is -3/8.\n\nNow, since from Equation (1) substitution, we had b + c = -19/24.\n\nSo c = -19/24 - b = -19/24 - (-3/8) = -19/24 + 9/24 = (-19 +9)/24 = (-10)/24 = -5/12\n\nSo c is -5/12.\n\nNow, let's find a from S = a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nSo a = -13/12 - b - c = -13/12 - (-3/8) - (-5/12)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-13/12 + 3/8 +5/12\n\nLet me convert all to 24 denominator:\n\n-13/12 = -26/24\n\n3/8 =9/24\n\n5/12=10/24\n\nSo:\n\n-26/24 +9/24 +10/24 = (-26 +9 +10)/24 = (-7)/24\n\nSo a= -7/24\n\nLet me recap:\n\na = log\u2082x = -7/24\n\nb = log\u2082y = -3/8\n\nc = log\u2082z = -5/12\n\nSo x = 2^(-7/24), y=2^(-3/8), z=2^(-5/12)\n\nBut the question asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|.\n\nLet me compute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z\n\nWhich is 4a + 3b + 2c.\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\n4*(-7/24) +3*(-3/8) +2*(-5/12)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6\n\n3*(-3/8) = -9/8\n\n2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nFirst, let's combine -7/6 and -5/6:\n\n(-7/6 -5/6) = -12/6 = -2\n\nSo now, -2 -9/8\n\nConvert -2 to -16/8:\n\n-16/8 -9/8 = (-25)/8\n\nSo log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = -25/8\n\nThe absolute value is | -25/8 | =25/8.\n\nSo the value is 25/8, which is already in simplest terms since 25 and 8 are coprime.\n\nTherefore, m=25, n=8, so m+n=33.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)| given a system of logarithmic equations. Hmm, let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the equations are:\n\n1. log\u2082(x/(yz)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y/(xz)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z/(xy)) = 1/4\n\nI remember that log\u2082(a/b) = log\u2082a - log\u2082b. So maybe I can rewrite each equation using that property.\n\nLet me rewrite each equation:\n\n1. log\u2082x - log\u2082y - log\u2082z = 1/2\n2. log\u2082y - log\u2082x - log\u2082z = 1/3\n3. log\u2082z - log\u2082x - log\u2082y = 1/4\n\nHmm, okay. So now I have three equations with variables log\u2082x, log\u2082y, and log\u2082z. Maybe I can let a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z. That should simplify things.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nNow I have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c. I can solve this system.\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2  --> Equation (1)\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3 --> Equation (2)\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4 --> Equation (3)\n\nI can try adding all three equations together to see if that helps.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here with logarithms and variables x, y, z. Let me try to unpack it step by step. \n\nThe problem states that x, y, and z are positive real numbers, and they satisfy a system of three logarithmic equations. The goal is to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2), which will be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nAlright, let's write down the equations:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nHmm, so each equation is a logarithm of a fraction equal to some fraction. Since logarithms can be tricky, maybe I can convert these into exponential form to make them easier to handle.\n\nRemembering that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So applying that here:\n\n1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)\n2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)\n3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)\n\nOkay, so that gives me three equations:\n\n1. x = 2^(1/2) * y z\n2. y = 2^(1/3) * x z\n3. z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nHmm, now I have expressions for each variable in terms of the others. It's a system of equations, so maybe I can substitute one into another to find a relationship.\n\nLet me try to express each variable in terms of x, y, z.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = sqrt(2) * y z.\n\nFrom equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) * x z.\n\nFrom equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * x y.\n\nWait, so each variable is proportional to the product of the other two. Maybe I can substitute equation 1 into equation 2.\n\nLet me see. Substitute x from equation 1 into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2 becomes:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * (sqrt(2) y z) * z\n\nSimplify that:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2) * y * z\u00b2\n\nHmm, so y on both sides. Let's divide both sides by y (since y is positive, it can't be zero):\n\n1 = 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2) * z\u00b2\n\nSo, z\u00b2 = 1 / (2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2))\n\nWait, 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) is 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6). So z\u00b2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nTherefore, z = 2^(-5/12). Because sqrt(z\u00b2) is z, and z is positive.\n\nWait, let me check the exponent: 2^(-5/6) is z squared, so z is 2^(-5/12). Because (-5/6) divided by 2 is (-5/12). Okay, that makes sense.\n\nSo z = 2^(-5/12).\n\nAlright, now that I have z, I can plug back into equation 3 to find y or x.\n\nWait, let me think. Maybe I can find another substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write all variables in terms of one variable, say x, and then solve for x.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = 2^(1/2) y z.\n\nFrom equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) x z.\n\nSo, substitute y into equation 1:\n\nx = 2^(1/2) * (2^(1/3) x z) * z\n\nSimplify:\n\nx = 2^(1/2 + 1/3) * x * z\u00b2\n\nCompute 1/2 + 1/3: that's 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6. So:\n\nx = 2^(5/6) * x * z\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by x (since x is positive, not zero):\n\n1 = 2^(5/6) * z\u00b2\n\nWhich is the same as before, leading to z\u00b2 = 2^(-5/6), so z = 2^(-5/12). So that's consistent.\n\nSo, z is known. Now, let's plug z into equation 3 to find a relationship between x and y.\n\nEquation 3: z = 2^(1/4) x y.\n\nWe have z = 2^(-5/12), so:\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) x y\n\nLet me write that as:\n\nx y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4)\n\nCompute exponents: -5/12 - 1/4. Wait, wait, no: dividing exponents is subtracting. So 2^(-5/12) divided by 2^(1/4) is 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) because 1/4 is 3/12.\n\nSo that's 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3). So:\n\nx y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nOkay, so x y = 2^(-2/3). Hmm, let's keep that in mind.\n\nNow, let's go back to equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) x z.\n\nWe know z = 2^(-5/12). So:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) x * 2^(-5/12)\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\n2^(1/3 -5/12) = 2^(4/12 -5/12) = 2^(-1/12). So:\n\ny = 2^(-1/12) x\n\nSo y is 2^(-1/12) times x.\n\nNow, since we have x y = 2^(-2/3), and y is 2^(-1/12) x, substitute that into x y:\n\nx * (2^(-1/12) x) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, x\u00b2 * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nThen, x\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3 + 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 + 1/12) = 2^(-7/12)\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24). Because sqrt(2^(-7/12)) is 2^(-7/24).\n\nWait, let me check: x squared is 2^(-7/12), so x is 2^(-7/24). Correct.\n\nNow, since y = 2^(-1/12) x, substitute x:\n\ny = 2^(-1/12) * 2^(-7/24) = 2^(-1/12 -7/24) = 2^(-2/24 -7/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8)\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nAnd earlier, we had z = 2^(-5/12)\n\nSo now we have x, y, z in terms of powers of 2. That should make it easier to compute log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2).\n\nLet me write down the expression:\n\nlog\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082( (x\u2074) * (y\u00b3) * (z\u00b2) )\n\nSince log(ab) = log a + log b, this becomes:\n\nlog\u2082(x\u2074) + log\u2082(y\u00b3) + log\u2082(z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z\n\nBut since x, y, z are powers of 2, log\u2082x is just the exponent, same for y and z.\n\nSo let's compute each term:\n\nlog\u2082x = exponent of x = -7/24\n\nlog\u2082y = exponent of y = -3/8\n\nlog\u2082z = exponent of z = -5/12\n\nTherefore,\n\n4 log\u2082x = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6\n\n3 log\u2082y = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8\n\n2 log\u2082z = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6\n\nNow, sum all these:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nFirst, find a common denominator. The denominators are 6, 8, 6. The least common multiple is 24.\n\nConvert each term:\n\n-7/6 = (-28)/24\n\n-9/8 = (-27)/24\n\n-5/6 = (-20)/24\n\nSo adding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify that fraction: 75 and 24 are both divisible by 3.\n\n75 \u00f73=25; 24 \u00f73=8. So, -75/24 = -25/8\n\nWait, but the question asks for the absolute value of log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2). So, absolute value of -25/8 is 25/8.\n\nSo, |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)| = 25/8.\n\nThus, m is 25 and n is 8, which are coprime.\n\nSo m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, from the equations, we found x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8), z=2^(-5/12).\n\nCompute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2):\n\nx\u2074 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/6)\n\ny\u00b3 = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)\n\nz\u00b2 = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiply them together: 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)\n\nCompute the exponents:\n\nConvert all to 24ths:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nSum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8\n\nSo log\u2082(...) is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the final answer is 25/8, so m + n is 33.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here with logarithms and variables x, y, z. Let me try to unpack it step by step. \n\nThe problem states that x, y, and z are positive real numbers, and they satisfy a system of three logarithmic equations. The goal is to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2), which will be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nAlright, let's write down the equations:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nHmm, so each equation is a logarithm of a fraction equal to some fraction. Since logarithms can be tricky, maybe I can convert these into exponential form to make them easier to handle.\n\nRemembering that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So applying that here:\n\n1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)\n2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)\n3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)\n\nOkay, so that gives me three equations:\n\n1. x = 2^(1/2) * y z\n2. y = 2^(1/3) * x z\n3. z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nHmm, now I have expressions for each variable in terms of the others. It's a system of equations, so maybe I can substitute one into another to find a relationship.\n\nLet me try to express each variable in terms of x, y, z.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = sqrt(2) * y z.\n\nFrom equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) * x z.\n\nFrom equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * x y.\n\nWait, so each variable is proportional to the product of the other two. Maybe I can substitute equation 1 into equation 2.\n\nLet me see. Substitute x from equation 1 into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2 becomes:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * (sqrt(2) y z) * z\n\nSimplify that:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2) * y * z\u00b2\n\nHmm, so y on both sides. Let's divide both sides by y (since y is positive, it can't be zero):\n\n1 = 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2) * z\u00b2\n\nSo, z\u00b2 = 1 / (2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2))\n\nWait, 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) is 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6). So z\u00b2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nTherefore, z = 2^(-5/12). Because sqrt(z\u00b2) is z, and z is positive.\n\nWait, let me check the exponent: 2^(-5/6) is z squared, so z is 2^(-5/12). Because (-5/6) divided by 2 is (-5/12). Okay, that makes sense.\n\nSo z = 2^(-5/12).\n\nAlright, now that I have z, I can plug back into equation 3 to find y or x.\n\nWait, let me think. Maybe I can find another substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write all variables in terms of one variable, say x, and then solve for x.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = 2^(1/2) y z.\n\nFrom equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) x z.\n\nSo, substitute y into equation 1:\n\nx = 2^(1/2) * (2^(1/3) x z) * z\n\nSimplify:\n\nx = 2^(1/2 + 1/3) * x * z\u00b2\n\nCompute 1/2 + 1/3: that's 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6. So:\n\nx = 2^(5/6) * x * z\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by x (since x is positive, not zero):\n\n1 = 2^(5/6) * z\u00b2\n\nWhich is the same as before, leading to z\u00b2 = 2^(-5/6), so z = 2^(-5/12). So that's consistent.\n\nSo, z is known. Now, let's plug z into equation 3 to find a relationship between x and y.\n\nEquation 3: z = 2^(1/4) x y.\n\nWe have z = 2^(-5/12), so:\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) x y\n\nLet me write that as:\n\nx y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4)\n\nCompute exponents: -5/12 - 1/4. Wait, wait, no: dividing exponents is subtracting. So 2^(-5/12) divided by 2^(1/4) is 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) because 1/4 is 3/12.\n\nSo that's 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3). So:\n\nx y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nOkay, so x y = 2^(-2/3). Hmm, let's keep that in mind.\n\nNow, let's go back to equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) x z.\n\nWe know z = 2^(-5/12). So:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) x * 2^(-5/12)\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\n2^(1/3 -5/12) = 2^(4/12 -5/12) = 2^(-1/12). So:\n\ny = 2^(-1/12) x\n\nSo y is 2^(-1/12) times x.\n\nNow, since we have x y = 2^(-2/3), and y is 2^(-1/12) x, substitute that into x y:\n\nx * (2^(-1/12) x) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, x\u00b2 * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nThen, x\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3 + 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 + 1/12) = 2^(-7/12)\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24). Because sqrt(2^(-7/12)) is 2^(-7/24).\n\nWait, let me check: x squared is 2^(-7/12), so x is 2^(-7/24). Correct.\n\nNow, since y = 2^(-1/12) x, substitute x:\n\ny = 2^(-1/12) * 2^(-7/24) = 2^(-1/12 -7/24) = 2^(-2/24 -7/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8)\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nAnd earlier, we had z = 2^(-5/12)\n\nSo now we have x, y, z in terms of powers of 2. That should make it easier to compute log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2).\n\nLet me write down the expression:\n\nlog\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082( (x\u2074) * (y\u00b3) * (z\u00b2) )\n\nSince log(ab) = log a + log b, this becomes:\n\nlog\u2082(x\u2074) + log\u2082(y\u00b3) + log\u2082(z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z\n\nBut since x, y, z are powers of 2, log\u2082x is just the exponent, same for y and z.\n\nSo let's compute each term:\n\nlog\u2082x = exponent of x = -7/24\n\nlog\u2082y = exponent of y = -3/8\n\nlog\u2082z = exponent of z = -5/12\n\nTherefore,\n\n4 log\u2082x = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6\n\n3 log\u2082y = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8\n\n2 log\u2082z = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6\n\nNow, sum all these:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nFirst, find a common denominator. The denominators are 6, 8, 6. The least common multiple is 24.\n\nConvert each term:\n\n-7/6 = (-28)/24\n\n-9/8 = (-27)/24\n\n-5/6 = (-20)/24\n\nSo adding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify that fraction: 75 and 24 are both divisible by 3.\n\n75 \u00f73=25; 24 \u00f73=8. So, -75/24 = -25/8\n\nWait, but the question asks for the absolute value of log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2). So, absolute value of -25/8 is 25/8.\n\nSo, |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)| = 25/8.\n\nThus, m is 25 and n is 8, which are coprime.\n\nSo m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, from the equations, we found x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8), z=2^(-5/12).\n\nCompute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2):\n\nx\u2074 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/6)\n\ny\u00b3 = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)\n\nz\u00b2 = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiply them together: 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)\n\nCompute the exponents:\n\nConvert all to 24ths:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nSum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8\n\nSo log\u2082(...) is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the final answer is 25/8, so m + n is 33.\n\n\nAlright, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nWe are given three equations involving logarithms:\n\n1. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n2. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\)\n3. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\nFirst, convert each logarithmic equation to its exponential form:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} \\) \u2192 \\( x = 2^{1/2} yz \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3} \\) \u2192 \\( y = 2^{1/3} xz \\)\n3. \\( \\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4} \\) \u2192 \\( z = 2^{1/4} xy \\)\n\nSubstitute \\( x = 2^{1/2} yz \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[\ny = 2^{1/3} (2^{1/2} yz) z = 2^{1/3 + 1/2} y z^2\n\\]\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\n\\[\ny = 2^{5/6} y z^2\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\( y \\) (since \\( y > 0 \\)):\n\n\\[\n1 = 2^{5/6} z^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad z^2 = 2^{-5/6} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad z = 2^{-5/12}\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( z = 2^{-5/12} \\) into the third equation:\n\n\\[\n2^{-5/12} = 2^{1/4} x y \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x y = 2^{-5/12 - 1/4} = 2^{-2/3}\n\\]\n\nExpress \\( y \\) from the second equation:\n\n\\[\ny = 2^{-1/12} x\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( y = 2^{-1/12} x \\) into \\( x y = 2^{-2/3} \\):\n\n\\[\nx (2^{-1/12} x) = 2^{-2/3} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x^2 = 2^{-2/3 + 1/12} = 2^{-7/12} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 2^{-7/24}\n\\]\n\nThen, \\( y = 2^{-1/12} x = 2^{-1/12} \\cdot 2^{-7/24} = 2^{-3/8} \\).\n\nNow, compute \\( \\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \\log_2 x + 3 \\log_2 y + 2 \\log_2 z\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( x = 2^{-7/24} \\), \\( y = 2^{-3/8} \\), and \\( z = 2^{-5/12} \\):\n\n\\[\n4 \\log_2 x = 4 \\left(-\\frac{7}{24}\\right) = -\\frac{7}{6}, \\quad 3 \\log_2 y = 3 \\left(-\\frac{3}{8}\\right) = -\\frac{9}{8}, \\quad 2 \\log_2 z = 2 \\left(-\\frac{5}{12}\\right) = -\\frac{5}{6}\n\\]\n\nAdd them together:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{7}{6} - \\frac{9}{8} - \\frac{5}{6} = -\\frac{28}{24} - \\frac{27}{24} - \\frac{20}{24} = -\\frac{75}{24} = -\\frac{25}{8}\n\\]\n\nTaking the absolute value:\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \\right| = \\frac{25}{8}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( m = 25 \\) and \\( n = 8 \\), so \\( m + n = 33 \\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{33}\\)",
