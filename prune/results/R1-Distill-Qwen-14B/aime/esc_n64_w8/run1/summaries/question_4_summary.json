      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game where they take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, let me start by understanding the game mechanics. Each player can remove 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. The last person to take a token wins. So, if you can force the game into a state where the opponent cannot win, you can win.\n\nI think this is a combinatorial game, so I should model it using the concept of winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win regardless of what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nLet me try to define the positions. Let's denote a position as 'n' tokens. If n is 0, the game is over, so that's a losing position because there are no tokens to take. For n = 1, the player can take 1 token and win, so that's a winning position. For n = 4, the player can take all 4 and win, so that's also a winning position.\n\nWait, but for n = 2, the player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. Alternatively, the player could take 4 tokens, but that's not possible because there's only 2. So the player has only one move, leading to the opponent winning. So n=2 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is. Similarly, for n=3, the player can take 1, leaving 2, which is a losing position for the opponent. So n=3 is a winning position.\n\nWait, let me write down these initial positions:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10...\nW/L: L W L W W ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\nWait, n=0 is losing. n=1: take 1, win. So W. n=2: can only take 1, leaving 1 for opponent, who wins. So n=2 is L. n=3: take 1, leaving 2 (L for opponent), so W. n=4: take 4 and win, so W. n=5: what can the player do? Take 1, leaving 4 (W for opponent), or take 4, leaving 1 (W for opponent). So in both cases, opponent can win. So n=5 is L. n=6: take 1, leaving 5 (L for opponent), so W. Alternatively, take 4, leaving 2 (L for opponent). Either way, W. So n=6 is W.\n\nWait, but wait. If n=5 is L, then n=6 can take 1 and leave 5 (L), so yes, W. n=7: options are take 1, leaving 6 (W) or take 4, leaving 3 (W). So both options leave opponent in W, so n=7 is L. Hmm, because whatever move you make, opponent can win. So n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: take 1, leaving 7 (L), so W. Alternatively, take 4, leaving 4 (W). So if you take 1, opponent is in L, so n=8 is W. n=9: take 1, leaving 8 (W), or take 4, leaving 5 (L). So if you take 4, opponent is left with 5 (L), so you can win. So n=9 is W. n=10: take 1, leaving 9 (W), or take 4, leaving 6 (W). So both options leave opponent in W, so n=10 is L.\n\nHmm, so the pattern so far is:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nW/L: L W L W W L W L W W L\n\nWait, let me list the losing positions (L) up to n=10: 0,2,5,7,10.\n\nIs there a pattern here? Let's see the differences between them:\n\nFrom 0 to 2: +2\n2 to 5: +3\n5 to7: +2\n7 to10:+3\nIf this pattern continues, next would be +2 to 12, then +3 to 15, etc.\n\nWait, but let me check n=11. n=11: take 1, leaving 10 (L), so you can win. So n=11 is W. n=12: take 1, leaving 11 (W), or take 4, leaving 8 (W). So both moves leave opponent in W. So n=12 is L.\n\nYes, so the losing positions are 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,... So the pattern seems to be adding 2, then 3, repeatedly.\n\nSo the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5? Wait, let me see:\n\nLooking at the losing positions: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,...\n\nWait, 0 mod5 is 0, 2 mod5 is 2, 5 mod5 is 0, 7 mod5 is 2, 10 mod5 is 0, 12 mod5 is 2, 15 mod5 is 0, etc. So the losing positions are numbers that are either 0 or 2 modulo 5.\n\nWait, let me check n=14: if n=14, is it a losing position? Let's see: n=14, the player can take 1, leaving 13 (W, because 13 mod5 is 3, which is W?), or take 4, leaving 10 (L). So if the player takes 4, opponent is left with 10 (L), so n=14 is W. So n=14 is W. So 14 mod5 is 4, which is W.\n\nn=12 is L, as I thought. So the losing positions are 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,... So they are numbers that are either 0 or 2 mod5. Because 0 mod5 is 0, 2 mod5 is 2, 5 mod5 is 0, 7 mod5 is 2, 10 mod5 is 0, 12 mod5 is 2, etc.\n\nWait, so the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5. So for n \u22650, if n mod5 is 0 or 2, then it's a losing position.\n\nWait, let me verify with n=17: 17 mod5 is 2, so it's a losing position. Let's see: n=17, the player can take 1, leaving 16, which is 16 mod5=1, which is W, so opponent can win. Or take 4, leaving 13, which is 13 mod5=3, which is W. So both options leave opponent in W, so n=17 is L, as expected.\n\nSimilarly, n=20: 20 mod5=0, so L. Let's see: take 1, leaves 19 (19 mod5=4, W), or take 4, leaves 16 (mod5=1, W). So both moves leave opponent in W, so n=20 is L.\n\nSo the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5. So the positions where n mod5 is 0 or 2 are losing positions. So if the game starts at such a position, the current player cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.\n\nBut wait, in the problem, Alice goes first. So for Bob to have a winning strategy, the starting position n must be a losing position for Alice, meaning that n is a losing position. Because if n is a losing position, then the first player (Alice) cannot force a win, so Bob can.\n\nWait, but in our analysis, the losing positions are when the current player cannot win, so if n is a losing position, the first player (Alice) will lose if Bob plays optimally. So the number of n \u22642024 where n is a losing position (i.e., n\u22610 or 2 mod5) will be the count we need.\n\nSo now, I need to count the number of integers n \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo let's calculate how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5 and \u22612 mod5.\n\nFirst, numbers \u22610 mod5: the sequence is 5,10,15,..., up to the maximum \u22642024. Similarly for \u22612 mod5: 2,7,12,..., up to \u22642024.\n\nLet me compute the count for each residue.\n\nFor residue 0 mod5: the numbers are 5,10,15,..., up to 2020 (since 2020=5\u00d7404, 5\u00d7404=2020, and 2025 is 5\u00d7405=2025, which is larger than 2024).\n\nThe number of terms is floor(2024/5). 2024 \u00f75 is 404.8, so floor is 404. But wait, 5\u00d7404=2020, which is \u22642024. So 404 terms for 0 mod5.\n\nSimilarly, for residue 2 mod5: the numbers are 2,7,12,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nThe last term would be 2022, because 2022 = 5\u00d7404 + 2 =2020 +2=2022. 2022 +5=2027>2024.\n\nSo the number of terms is also 404, because the sequence starts at 2 and ends at 2022, with a common difference of 5.\n\nWait, let me check: the nth term of the sequence 2 mod5 is 2 +5(n-1). We can set this \u22642024.\n\n2 +5(n-1) \u22642024 \u21925(n-1) \u22642022 \u2192n-1 \u2264404.4 \u2192n \u2264405.4. So the maximum integer n is 405, but let me check 2 +5\u00d7404=2+2020=2022, which is \u22642024. So the number of terms is 405.\n\nWait, because starting from n=1: 2 +5\u00d70=2, n=2:7=2+5\u00d71, up to n=405:2+5\u00d7404=2022. So 405 terms.\n\nWait, but wait, 405\u00d75=2025, but we're adding 2, so 2022 is the last term. So 405 terms for residue 2 mod5.\n\nSo total losing positions would be 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5) = 809.\n\nWait, but wait, let me confirm:\n\nFor 0 mod5: numbers are 5,10,...,2020. Number of terms is (2020-5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.\n\nFor 2 mod5: numbers are 2,7,...,2022. Number of terms is ((2022-2)/5)+1=(2020/5)+1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo total is 404 +405=809.\n\nBut wait, let's check if 2024 is included. 2024 mod5: 2024 \u00f75=404\u00d75=2020, 2024-2020=4, so 2024 mod5=4, which is neither 0 nor 2. So the last term in 2 mod5 is 2022, which is \u22642024.\n\nSo the total number of losing positions is 809.\n\nBut wait, I think I might have a mistake here. Let me recount.\n\nWait, for 0 mod5: the numbers start at 5 and go up to 2020. The count is 2020 /5=404 numbers.\n\nFor 2 mod5: numbers start at 2, then 7,12,...,2022. The count is ((2022 -2)/5) +1 = (2020/5)+1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo total losing positions: 404 +405=809.\n\nSo the answer would be 809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check with small n:\n\nn=0: L\nn=1: W\nn=2: L\nn=3: W\nn=4: W\nn=5: L\nn=6: W\nn=7: L\nn=8: W\nn=9: W\nn=10:L\nn=11:W\nn=12:L\nn=13:W\nn=14:W\nn=15:L\nn=16:W\nn=17:L\nn=18:W\nn=19:W\nn=20:L\n\nSo the losing positions up to n=20 are: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20. So that's 9 numbers. Let's see according to our formula:\n\nNumbers \u226420:\n\nFor 0 mod5: 5,10,15,20 \u21924 numbers.\n\nFor 2 mod5: 2,7,12,17 \u21924 numbers.\n\nWait, but wait, 0 is included if n=0 is considered, but the problem states positive integers n, so n starts at 1. So n=0 is not counted.\n\nSo in the above list, up to n=20, the losing positions are 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20 \u21928 numbers.\n\nWhich is 4 for 0 mod5 (5,10,15,20) and 4 for 2 mod5 (2,7,12,17). So 8 numbers.\n\nWhich matches the formula: for n \u226420, number of 0 mod5 is 4 (since 20/5=4), and 2 mod5 is also 4 (since (20-2)/5=3.6 \u21924 terms). So 4+4=8.\n\nSo in our problem, since n starts at 1, 0 mod5 starts at 5, and 2 mod5 starts at 2.\n\nThus, for n up to 2024, the count is 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5) =809.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about the losing positions, I thought the losing positions are 0,2,5,7,10,12, etc., but for the problem, n starts at 1, so the first losing position is 2.\n\nSo, the count is correct: 404+405=809.\n\nWait, but let me check n=2024: 2024 mod5 is 4, which isn't a losing position. So the last losing position \u22642024 is 2022 (for 2 mod5) and 2020 (for 0 mod5).\n\nYes, so 404 terms for 0 mod5 and 405 for 2 mod5.\n\nSo the answer is 809.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nAlice and Bob play a game with a stack of $n$ tokens. Players take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens, starting with Alice. The player who removes the last token wins. We need to determine how many positive integers $n \\leq 2024$ allow Bob to guarantee a win, regardless of Alice's moves.\n\nTo solve this, we analyze the game using the concept of winning (W) and losing (L) positions.

Alternatively, the player could take 4 tokens, but that's not possible because there's only 2. So the player has only one move, leading to the opponent winning. So n=2 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is. Similarly, for n=3, the player can take 1, leaving 2, which is a losing position for the opponent. So n=3 is a winning position.\n\nWait, let me write down these initial positions:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10...\nW/L: L W L W W ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\nWait, n=0 is losing. n=1: take 1, win. So W. n=2: can only take 1, leaving 1 for opponent, who wins. So n=2 is L. n=3: take 1, leaving 2 (L for opponent), so W. n=4: take 4 and win, so W. n=5: what can the player do? Take 1, leaving 4 (W for opponent), or take 4, leaving 1 (W for opponent). So in both cases, opponent can win. So n=5 is L. n=6: take 1, leaving 5 (L for opponent), so W. Alternatively, take 4, leaving 2 (L for opponent). Either way, W. So n=6 is W.\n\nWait, but wait. If n=5 is L, then n=6 can take 1 and leave 5 (L), so yes, W. n=7: options are take 1, leaving 6 (W) or take 4, leaving 3 (W). So both options leave opponent in W, so n=7 is L. Hmm, because whatever move you make, opponent can win. So n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: take 1, leaving 7 (L), so W. Alternatively, take 4, leaving 4 (W). So if you take 1, opponent is in L, so n=8 is W. n=9: take 1, leaving 8 (W), or take 4, leaving 5 (L). So if you take 4, opponent is left with 5 (L), so you can win. So n=9 is W. n=10: take 1, leaving 9 (W), or take 4, leaving 6 (W). So both options leave opponent in W, so n=10 is L.\n\nHmm, so the pattern so far is:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nW/L: L W L W W L W L W W L\n\nWait, let me list the losing positions (L) up to n=10: 0,2,5,7,10.\n\nIs there a pattern here?

So n=11 is W. n=12: take 1, leaving 11 (W), or take 4, leaving 8 (W). So both moves leave opponent in W. So n=12 is L.\n\nYes, so the losing positions are 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,... So the pattern seems to be adding 2, then 3, repeatedly.\n\nSo the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5? Wait, let me see:\n\nLooking at the losing positions: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,...\n\nWait, 0 mod5 is 0, 2 mod5 is 2, 5 mod5 is 0, 7 mod5 is 2, 10 mod5 is 0, 12 mod5 is 2, 15 mod5 is 0, etc. So the losing positions are numbers that are either 0 or 2 modulo 5.\n\nWait, let me check n=14: if n=14, is it a losing position? Let's see: n=14, the player can take 1, leaving 13 (W, because 13 mod5 is 3, which is W?), or take 4, leaving 10 (L). So if the player takes 4, opponent is left with 10 (L), so n=14 is W. So n=14 is W. So 14 mod5 is 4, which is W.\n\nn=12 is L, as I thought. So the losing positions are 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,... So they are numbers that are either 0 or 2 mod5. Because 0 mod5 is 0, 2 mod5 is 2, 5 mod5 is 0, 7 mod5 is 2, 10 mod5 is 0, 12 mod5 is 2, etc.\n\nWait, so the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5. So for n \u22650, if n mod5 is 0 or 2, then it's a losing position.\n\nWait, let me verify with n=17: 17 mod5 is 2, so it's a losing position. Let's see: n=17, the player can take 1, leaving 16, which is 16 mod5=1, which is W, so opponent can win. Or take 4, leaving 13, which is 13 mod5=3, which is W. So both options leave opponent in W, so n=17 is L, as expected.\n\nSimilarly, n=20: 20 mod5=0, so L. Let's see: take 1, leaves 19 (19 mod5=4, W), or take 4, leaves 16 (mod5=1, W). So both moves leave opponent in W, so n=20 is L.\n\nSo the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5. So the positions where n mod5 is 0 or 2 are losing positions. So if the game starts at such a position, the current player cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.\n\nBut wait, in the problem, Alice goes first. So for Bob to have a winning strategy, the starting position n must be a losing position for Alice, meaning that n is a losing position. Because if n is a losing position, then the first player (Alice) cannot force a win, so Bob can.\n\nWait, but in our analysis, the losing positions are when the current player cannot win, so if n is a losing position, the first player (Alice) will lose if Bob plays optimally. So the number of n \u22642024 where n is a losing position (i.e., n\u22610 or 2 mod5) will be the count we need.\n\nSo now, I need to count the number of integers n \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo let's calculate how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5 and \u22612 mod5.\n\nFirst, numbers \u22610 mod5: the sequence is 5,10,15,..., up to the maximum \u22642024. Similarly for \u22612 mod5: 2,7,12,..., up to \u22642024.\n\nLet me compute the count for each residue.\n\nFor residue 0 mod5: the numbers are 5,10,15,..., up to 2020 (since 2020=5\u00d7404, 5\u00d7404=2020, and 2025 is 5\u00d7405=2025, which is larger than 2024).\n\nThe number of terms is floor(2024/5). 2024 \u00f75 is 404.8, so floor is 404. But wait, 5\u00d7404=2020, which is \u22642024. So 404 terms for 0 mod5.\n\nSimilarly, for residue 2 mod5: the numbers are 2,7,12,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nThe last term would be 2022, because 2022 = 5\u00d7404 + 2 =2020 +2=2022. 2022 +5=2027>2024.\n\nSo the number of terms is also 404, because the sequence starts at 2 and ends at 2022, with a common difference of 5.\n\nWait, let me check: the nth term of the sequence 2 mod5 is 2 +5(n-1). We can set this \u22642024.\n\n2 +5(n-1) \u22642024 \u21925(n-1) \u22642022 \u2192n-1 \u2264404.4 \u2192n \u2264405.4. So the maximum integer n is 405, but let me check 2 +5\u00d7404=2+2020=2022, which is \u22642024. So the number of terms is 405.\n\nWait, because starting from n=1: 2 +5\u00d70=2, n=2:7=2+5\u00d71, up to n=405:2+5\u00d7404=2022. So 405 terms.\n\nWait, but wait, 405\u00d75=2025, but we're adding 2, so 2022 is the last term. So 405 terms for residue 2 mod5.\n\nSo total losing positions would be 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5) = 809.\n\nWait, but wait, let me confirm:\n\nFor 0 mod5: numbers are 5,10,...,2020. Number of terms is (2020-5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.\n\nFor 2 mod5: numbers are 2,7,...,2022. Number of terms is ((2022-2)/5)+1=(2020/5)+1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo total is 404 +405=809.\n\nBut wait, let's check if 2024 is included. 2024 mod5: 2024 \u00f75=404\u00d75=2020, 2024-2020=4, so 2024 mod5=4, which is neither 0 nor 2. So the last term in 2 mod5 is 2022, which is \u22642024.\n\nSo the total number of losing positions is 809.\n\nBut wait, I think I might have a mistake here. Let me recount.\n\nWait, for 0 mod5: the numbers start at 5 and go up to 2020. The count is 2020 /5=404 numbers.\n\nFor 2 mod5: numbers start at 2, then 7,12,...,2022. The count is ((2022 -2)/5) +1 = (2020/5)+1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo total losing positions: 404 +405=809.\n\nSo the answer would be 809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check with small n:\n\nn=0: L\nn=1: W\nn=2: L\nn=3: W\nn=4: W\nn=5: L\nn=6: W\nn=7: L\nn=8: W\nn=9: W\nn=10:L\nn=11:W\nn=12:L\nn=13:W\nn=14:W\nn=15:L\nn=16:W\nn=17:L\nn=18:W\nn=19:W\nn=20:L\n\nSo the losing positions up to n=20 are: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20. So that's 9 numbers. Let's see according to our formula:\n\nNumbers \u226420:\n\nFor 0 mod5: 5,10,15,20 \u21924 numbers.\n\nFor 2 mod5: 2,7,12,17 \u21924 numbers.\n\nWait, but wait, 0 is included if n=0 is considered, but the problem states positive integers n, so n starts at 1. So n=0 is not counted.\n\nSo in the above list, up to n=20, the losing positions are 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20 \u21928 numbers.\n\nWhich is 4 for 0 mod5 (5,10,15,20) and 4 for 2 mod5 (2,7,12,17). So 8 numbers.\n\nWhich matches the formula: for n \u226420, number of 0 mod5 is 4 (since 20/5=4), and 2 mod5 is also 4 (since (20-2)/5=3.6 \u21924 terms). So 4+4=8.\n\nSo in our problem, since n starts at 1, 0 mod5 starts at 5, and 2 mod5 starts at 2.\n\nThus, for n up to 2024, the count is 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5) =809.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about the losing positions, I thought the losing positions are 0,2,5,7,10,12, etc., but for the problem, n starts at 1, so the first losing position is 2.\n\nSo, the count is correct: 404+405=809.\n\nWait, but let me check n=2024: 2024 mod5 is 4, which isn't a losing position. So the last losing position \u22642024 is 2022 (for 2 mod5) and 2020 (for 0 mod5).\n\nYes, so 404 terms for 0 mod5 and 405 for 2 mod5.\n\nSo the answer is 809.\n\n\nAlice and Bob play a game with a stack of $n$ tokens. Players take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens, starting with Alice. The player who removes the last token wins. We need to determine how many positive integers $n \\leq 2024$ allow Bob to guarantee a win, regardless of Alice's moves.\n\nTo solve this, we analyze the game using the concept of winning (W) and losing (L) positions. A losing position is one where the current player cannot force a win, assuming optimal play from the opponent.\n\nBy examining small values of $n$, we identify the following pattern for losing positions:\n- $n = 0$ is a losing position (L).\n- $n = 2$, $5$, $7$, $10$, $12$, $15$, $17$, $20$, ... are losing positions.\n\nThese losing positions occur at $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ and $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$. Therefore, for $n \\leq 2024$, we count the numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.\n\n1. **Counting numbers $\\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ up to 2024**:\n   - The sequence is $5, 10, 15, \\ldots, 2020$.\n   - The number of terms is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{2024}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 404$.\n\n2. **Counting numbers $\\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$ up to 2024**:\n   - The sequence is $2, 7, 12, \\ldots, 2022$.\n   - The number of terms is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{2024 - 2}{5} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 405$.\n\nAdding these counts gives the total number of losing positions: $404 + 405 = 809$.\n\nThus, there are $\\boxed{809}$ positive integers $n \\leq 2024$ where Bob can guarantee a win.\n\n$\\boxed{809}$",

Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. It seems like a combinatorial game theory problem, probably involving the concept of winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does, while a losing position is the opposite\u2014the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.\n\nSo, the key is to determine for each n whether it's a winning or losing position. Since Alice goes first, if n is a winning position, Alice can force a win. Conversely, if n is a losing position, Bob can force a win. Therefore, I need to find all n \u2264 2024 where n is a losing position for the starting player (Alice), which would make it a winning position for Bob.\n\nLet me try to model this. I'll start by looking for a pattern in small values of n. Let's list the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L).\n\nn=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So, W.\nn=2: Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Or Alice can't take 4, so she must take 1. So Bob wins, so n=2 is L? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, Alice takes 1, leaving 1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So Alice can't force a win here. So n=2 is L for Alice, meaning Bob can win. Wait, but if n=2 is L, that means the current player (Alice) is in a losing position, so Bob can win. So yes, n=2 is L.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of Grundy numbers or something. Alternatively, maybe it's better to list the positions as W or L step by step.\n\nLet me create a table:\n\nn | Outcome (W/L)\n---|---\n0 | L (since no tokens left, game over; but since you can't make a move, the player to move loses. So if n=0, the player can't move and loses.)\n1 | W (take 1)\n2 | ?\n3 | ?\n4 | W (take 4)\n5 | ?\n6 | ?\n7 | ?\n8 | W (take 4, leaving 4 for Bob, but wait, if you leave 4, Bob can take all and win. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.)\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model each position based on whether any move leads to a losing position for the opponent.\n\nSo for n=1: you can take 1, leaving 0 for the opponent, which is a losing position. So n=1 is W.\n\nn=2: you can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, which is a W for them. Or can you take 4? No, because 4 > 2. So only option is to take 1, leaving n=1 (W for opponent). So since all moves lead to W for opponent, n=2 is L.\n\nn=3: You can take 1, leaving n=2 (L). So opponent is in L, so n=3 is W.\n\nn=4: You can take 4, leaving 0 (L). So n=4 is W.\n\nn=5: You can take 1, leaving n=4 (W), or take 4, leaving n=1 (W). So all moves lead to W for opponent. So n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: Take 1, leaving n=5 (L). So opponent is in L. So n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: Take 1, leaving n=6 (W); take 4, leaving n=3 (W). So both moves lead to opponent's W. So n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: Take 1, leaving n=7 (L). So opponent is in L. So n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: Take 1, leaving n=8 (W); take 4, leaving n=5 (L). So if you take 4, opponent is in L. So n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: Take 1, leaving n=9 (W); take 4, leaving n=6 (W). So both moves lead to W for opponent. So n=10 is L.\n\nn=11: Take 1, leaving n=10 (L). So n=11 is W.\n\nn=12: Take 1, leaving n=11 (W); take 4, leaving n=8 (W). So n=12 is L? Wait, because both options lead to W for opponent. So n=12 is L.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me check n=12 again. If I take 1, opponent gets n=11 (W). If I take 4, opponent gets n=8 (W). So yes, all moves lead to opponent's W. So n=12 is L.\n\nHmm, looking at the pattern so far:\n\nn: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\nOutcome: L W L W W L W L W W L W L\n\nWait, maybe the pattern repeats every 5 numbers? Let me see.\n\nWait, let's list the outcomes:\n\nn | Outcome\n---|---\n0 | L\n1 | W\n2 | L\n3 | W\n4 | W\n5 | L\n6 | W\n7 | L\n8 | W\n9 | W\n10 | L\n11 | W\n12 | L\n13 | W\n14 | W\n15 | L\n16 | W\n17 | L\n18 | W\n19 | W\n20 | L\n... | ...\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is every 5 numbers, the losing positions are at n=2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the losing positions so far: 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nHmm, it seems that every 5 numbers, the losing positions are at 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20, etc.\n\nWait, maybe the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 or 5 mod 7? Or perhaps another modulus.\n\nWait, let's see the differences between losing positions:\n\nFrom 2 to 5: 3\n\n5 to 7: 2\n\n7 to 10: 3\n\n10 to 12: 2\n\n12 to 15: 3\n\n15 to 17: 2\n\n17 to 20: 3\n\nSo the pattern alternates between adding 3 and 2.\n\nHmm, perhaps the losing positions are every 5, starting at 2? Let's see:\n\nn=2: L\n\nn=5: L\n\nn=7: L (2 +5 =7? No, 2+5=7, yes.\n\nn=10: 7+3=10\n\nn=12: 10+2=12\n\nn=15:12+3=15\n\nn=17:15+2=17\n\nn=20:17+3=20\n\nn=22:20+2=22\n\nn=25:22+3=25\n\nWait, so the losing positions are every 5 steps: 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,30, etc.\n\nWait, but that's not every 5, but seems like every 5, but let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 and 5 mod 7? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the losing positions follow a cycle of 5, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nEach position n is a losing position if all moves from n lead to winning positions.\n\nSo, for n \u2265 1:\n\nn is a losing position if both n-1 and n-4 (if n\u22654) are winning positions.\n\nWait, no. Wait, n is losing (L) if every possible move from n leads to a W position.\n\nSo, for n, if taking 1 token leads to W, and taking 4 tokens (if possible) also leads to W, then n is L.\n\nAlternatively, if taking 1 leads to W and taking 4 (if possible) leads to L, then n is W.\n\nSo, the recurrence is: n is L if for all possible moves m (1 or 4), n - m is W.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me formalize it.\n\nDefine f(n) as true if the current player can force a win from n tokens.\n\nBase case:\n\nf(0) = false (no tokens, can't move, so lose)\n\nf(1) = true (take 1 and win)\n\nf(2) = f(1) \u2192 because you can only take 1, leading to 1, which is true. Wait, but that would mean f(2) is false, because if all moves lead to true, then current player can't force a win.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as:\n\nf(n) is true if there exists a move (taking 1 or 4) such that f(n - move) is false.\n\nBecause if any move leads to the opponent being in a losing position, then current player can win.\n\nSo, f(n) = (f(n-1) is false) OR (n >=4 and f(n-4) is false).\n\nLet me try to compute f(n) for small n using this.\n\nn=0: f(0)=false\n\nn=1: can take 1, leading to 0 (false). So f(1)=true.\n\nn=2: can take 1, leading to 1 (true). So f(2)=false (since no move leads to opponent losing).\n\nn=3: can take 1, leading to 2 (false). So f(3)=true.\n\nn=4: can take 4, leading to 0 (false). So f(4)=true.\n\nn=5: can take 1 \u2192 4 (true), or 4 \u21921 (true). So both moves lead to true, so f(5)=false.\n\nn=6: can take 1 \u21925 (false), so f(6)=true.\n\nn=7: can take 1 \u21926 (true), or 4 \u21923 (true). So both moves lead to true, so f(7)=false.\n\nn=8: can take 1 \u21927 (false), so f(8)=true.\n\nn=9: can take 1 \u21928 (true), or 4 \u21925 (false). So since one move leads to false, f(9)=true.\n\nn=10: can take 1 \u21929 (true), or 4 \u21926 (true). So f(10)=false.\n\nn=11: can take 1 \u219210 (false), so f(11)=true.\n\nn=12: can take 1 \u219211 (true), or 4 \u21928 (true). So f(12)=false.\n\nn=13: can take 1 \u219212 (false), so f(13)=true.\n\nn=14: can take 1 \u219213 (true), or 4 \u219210 (false). So f(14)=true.\n\nn=15: can take 1 \u219214 (true), or 4 \u219211 (true). So f(15)=false.\n\nn=16: can take 1 \u219215 (false), so f(16)=true.\n\nn=17: can take 1 \u219216 (true), or 4 \u219213 (true). So f(17)=false.\n\nn=18: can take 1 \u219217 (false), so f(18)=true.\n\nn=19: can take 1 \u219218 (true), or 4 \u219215 (false). So f(19)=true.\n\nn=20: can take 1 \u219219 (true), or 4 \u219216 (true). So f(20)=false.\n\nHmm, so the losing positions (f(n)=false) are at n=2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20, etc.\n\nLooking at these, let's see the pattern:\n\n2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nThe differences between consecutive terms are:\n\n5-2=3,\n\n7-5=2,\n\n10-7=3,\n\n12-10=2,\n\n15-12=3,\n\n17-15=2,\n\n20-17=3,\n\nSo the pattern alternates between adding 3 and 2.\n\nSo the losing positions are numbers that can be generated by starting at 2 and alternately adding 3 and 2.\n\nSo the sequence is 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,30, etc.\n\nWait, let's see how this can be represented. It looks like every 5 numbers, the losing positions are at 2 and 5, then 7 and 10, then 12 and 15, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 and 5 mod 7? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the losing positions are numbers that are 2 mod 5 and 0 mod 5? Wait, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... Hmm, 2 mod 5 is 2,7,12,17,22,... and 5 mod 5 is 0, but 5 is 0 mod 5. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, looking at the sequence, every 5 numbers, the losing positions are at 2 and 5 in the first 5, then 7 and 10 in the next 5, then 12 and 15, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the losing positions are numbers where n \u2261 2 or 0 mod 5? Because 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... So 2 mod 5 is 2,7,12,17,22,... and 0 mod 5 is 5,10,15,20, etc. So the losing positions are numbers that are either 0 or 2 mod 5.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=5: 5 mod5=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=7:7 mod5=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=15:15 mod5=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=17:17 mod5=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=20:20 mod5=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nYes, that seems to fit. So the losing positions are n where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, but let me check n=22: 22 mod5=2 \u2192 yes, and n=25 mod5=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the number of losing positions up to n=2024 would be the count of numbers \u22642024 where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nSo, how many numbers \u22642024 are congruent to 0 mod5 or 2 mod5.\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nFor each modulus, the count is floor((2024 - r)/5) +1, where r is the remainder.\n\nFor r=0:\n\nNumbers are 5,10,15,... up to \u22642024.\n\nThe maximum multiple is floor(2024/5)=404.8 \u2192 404*5=2020. So 404 numbers.\n\nWait, wait, 5*404=2020, which is \u22642024. So 404 numbers.\n\nFor r=2:\n\nNumbers are 2,7,12,... up to \u22642024.\n\nThe sequence starts at 2, then 7,12,... The nth term is 5n -3.\n\nWait, wait, let's find the maximum k such that 5k +2 \u22642024.\n\nSo 5k \u22642022 \u2192 k \u22642022/5=404.4 \u2192 k=404.\n\nSo the last term is 5*404 +2=2022, which is \u22642024. So the count is 405, because starting from k=0 to k=404, which is 405 numbers.\n\nWait, wait, let me check: for r=2, the first number is 2=5*0 +2, then 7=5*1 +2, up to 5*404 +2=2022.\n\nSo the count is 405 numbers.\n\nWait, but 5*404=2020, 2020+2=2022. Next would be 2027, which is beyond 2024, so yes, 405 numbers.\n\nSo total losing positions are 404 (for r=0) +405 (for r=2) = 809.\n\nWait, but wait: 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so 404 full cycles.\n\nWait, but for r=0, the count is 404 (since 5*404=2020 \u22642024).\n\nFor r=2, the count is 405 because the last term is 2022, which is \u22642024. So 405 numbers.\n\nThus, total losing positions \u22642024: 404 + 405 = 809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check:\n\nFrom 0 mod5: numbers are 5,10,...,2020. That's 2020/5=404 numbers.\n\nFrom 2 mod5: numbers are 2,7,...,2022. How many terms?\n\nThe nth term is 5n-3=2,7,12,... So 5n-3 \u22642024 \u21925n \u22642027 \u2192n \u2264405.4 \u2192n=405. So 405 numbers.\n\nSo total is 404 +405=809.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive integers n \u22642024 where Bob can force a win is 809.\n",

So if n=0, the player can't move and loses.)\n1 | W (take 1)\n2 | ?\n3 | ?\n4 | W (take 4)\n5 | ?\n6 | ?\n7 | ?\n8 | W (take 4, leaving 4 for Bob, but wait, if you leave 4, Bob can take all and win. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.)\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model each position based on whether any move leads to a losing position for the opponent.\n\nSo for n=1: you can take 1, leaving 0 for the opponent, which is a losing position. So n=1 is W.\n\nn=2: you can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, which is a W for them. Or can you take 4? No, because 4 > 2. So only option is to take 1, leaving n=1 (W for opponent). So since all moves lead to W for opponent, n=2 is L.\n\nn=3: You can take 1, leaving n=2 (L). So opponent is in L, so n=3 is W.\n\nn=4: You can take 4, leaving 0 (L). So n=4 is W.\n\nn=5: You can take 1, leaving n=4 (W), or take 4, leaving n=1 (W). So all moves lead to W for opponent. So n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: Take 1, leaving n=5 (L). So opponent is in L. So n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: Take 1, leaving n=6 (W); take 4, leaving n=3 (W). So both moves lead to opponent's W. So n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: Take 1, leaving n=7 (L). So opponent is in L. So n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: Take 1, leaving n=8 (W); take 4, leaving n=5 (L). So if you take 4, opponent is in L. So n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: Take 1, leaving n=9 (W); take 4, leaving n=6 (W). So both moves lead to W for opponent. So n=10 is L.\n\nn=11: Take 1, leaving n=10 (L). So n=11 is W.\n\nn=12: Take 1, leaving n=11 (W); take 4, leaving n=8 (W). So n=12 is L? Wait, because both options lead to W for opponent. So n=12 is L.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me check n=12 again. If I take 1, opponent gets n=11 (W). If I take 4, opponent gets n=8 (W). So yes, all moves lead to opponent's W. So n=12 is L.\n\nHmm, looking at the pattern so far:\n\nn: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\nOutcome: L W L W W L W L W W L W L\n\nWait, maybe the pattern repeats every 5 numbers? Let me see.\n\nWait, let's list the outcomes:\n\nn | Outcome\n---|---\n0 | L\n1 | W\n2 | L\n3 | W\n4 | W\n5 | L\n6 | W\n7 | L\n8 | W\n9 | W\n10 | L\n11 | W\n12 | L\n13 | W\n14 | W\n15 | L\n16 | W\n17 | L\n18 | W\n19 | W\n20 | L\n... | ...\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is every 5 numbers, the losing positions are at n=2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the losing positions so far: 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nHmm, it seems that every 5 numbers, the losing positions are at 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20, etc.\n\nWait, maybe the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 or 5 mod 7? Or perhaps another modulus.\n\nWait, let's see the differences between losing positions:\n\nFrom 2 to 5: 3\n\n5 to 7: 2\n\n7 to 10: 3\n\n10 to 12: 2\n\n12 to 15: 3\n\n15 to 17: 2\n\n17 to 20: 3\n\nSo the pattern alternates between adding 3 and 2.\n\nHmm, perhaps the losing positions are every 5, starting at 2? Let's see:\n\nn=2: L\n\nn=5: L\n\nn=7: L (2 +5 =7? No, 2+5=7, yes.\n\nn=10: 7+3=10\n\nn=12: 10+2=12\n\nn=15:12+3=15\n\nn=17:15+2=17\n\nn=20:17+3=20\n\nn=22:20+2=22\n\nn=25:22+3=25\n\nWait, so the losing positions are every 5 steps: 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,30, etc.\n\nWait, but that's not every 5, but seems like every 5, but let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 and 5 mod 7? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the losing positions follow a cycle of 5, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nEach position n is a losing position if all moves from n lead to winning positions.\n\nSo, for n \u2265 1:\n\nn is a losing position if both n-1 and n-4 (if n\u22654) are winning positions.\n\nWait, no. Wait, n is losing (L) if every possible move from n leads to a W position.\n\nSo, for n, if taking 1 token leads to W, and taking 4 tokens (if possible) also leads to W, then n is L.\n\nAlternatively, if taking 1 leads to W and taking 4 (if possible) leads to L, then n is W.\n\nSo, the recurrence is: n is L if for all possible moves m (1 or 4), n - m is W.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me formalize it.\n\nDefine f(n) as true if the current player can force a win from n tokens.\n\nBase case:\n\nf(0) = false (no tokens, can't move, so lose)\n\nf(1) = true (take 1 and win)\n\nf(2) = f(1) \u2192 because you can only take 1, leading to 1, which is true. Wait, but that would mean f(2) is false, because if all moves lead to true, then current player can't force a win.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as:\n\nf(n) is true if there exists a move (taking 1 or 4) such that f(n - move) is false.\n\nBecause if any move leads to the opponent being in a losing position, then current player can win.\n\nSo, f(n) = (f(n-1) is false) OR (n >=4 and f(n-4) is false).\n\nLet me try to compute f(n) for small n using this.\n\nn=0: f(0)=false\n\nn=1: can take 1, leading to 0 (false). So f(1)=true.\n\nn=2: can take 1, leading to 1 (true). So f(2)=false (since no move leads to opponent losing).\n\nn=3: can take 1, leading to 2 (false). So f(3)=true.\n\nn=4: can take 4, leading to 0 (false). So f(4)=true.\n\nn=5: can take 1 \u2192 4 (true), or 4 \u21921 (true). So both moves lead to true, so f(5)=false.\n\nn=6: can take 1 \u21925 (false), so f(6)=true.\n\nn=7: can take 1 \u21926 (true), or 4 \u21923 (true). So both moves lead to true, so f(7)=false.\n\nn=8: can take 1 \u21927 (false), so f(8)=true.\n\nn=9: can take 1 \u21928 (true), or 4 \u21925 (false). So since one move leads to false, f(9)=true.\n\nn=10: can take 1 \u21929 (true), or 4 \u21926 (true). So f(10)=false.\n\nn=11: can take 1 \u219210 (false), so f(11)=true.\n\nn=12: can take 1 \u219211 (true), or 4 \u21928 (true). So f(12)=false.\n\nn=13: can take 1 \u219212 (false), so f(13)=true.\n\nn=14: can take 1 \u219213 (true), or 4 \u219210 (false). So f(14)=true.\n\nn=15: can take 1 \u219214 (true), or 4 \u219211 (true). So f(15)=false.\n\nn=16: can take 1 \u219215 (false), so f(16)=true.\n\nn=17: can take 1 \u219216 (true), or 4 \u219213 (true). So f(17)=false.\n\nn=18: can take 1 \u219217 (false), so f(18)=true.\n\nn=19: can take 1 \u219218 (true), or 4 \u219215 (false). So f(19)=true.\n\nn=20: can take 1 \u219219 (true), or 4 \u219216 (true). So f(20)=false.\n\nHmm, so the losing positions (f(n)=false) are at n=2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20, etc.\n\nLooking at these, let's see the pattern:\n\n2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nThe differences between consecutive terms are:\n\n5-2=3,\n\n7-5=2,\n\n10-7=3,\n\n12-10=2,\n\n15-12=3,\n\n17-15=2,\n\n20-17=3,\n\nSo the pattern alternates between adding 3 and 2.\n\nSo the losing positions are numbers that can be generated by starting at 2 and alternately adding 3 and 2.\n\nSo the sequence is 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,30, etc.\n\nWait, let's see how this can be represented. It looks like every 5 numbers, the losing positions are at 2 and 5, then 7 and 10, then 12 and 15, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 and 5 mod 7? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the losing positions are numbers that are 2 mod 5 and 0 mod 5? Wait, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... Hmm, 2 mod 5 is 2,7,12,17,22,... and 5 mod 5 is 0, but 5 is 0 mod 5. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, looking at the sequence, every 5 numbers, the losing positions are at 2 and 5 in the first 5, then 7 and 10 in the next 5, then 12 and 15, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the losing positions are numbers where n \u2261 2 or 0 mod 5? Because 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... So 2 mod 5 is 2,7,12,17,22,... and 0 mod 5 is 5,10,15,20, etc. So the losing positions are numbers that are either 0 or 2 mod 5.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=5: 5 mod5=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=7:7 mod5=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=15:15 mod5=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=17:17 mod5=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=20:20 mod5=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nYes, that seems to fit. So the losing positions are n where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, but let me check n=22: 22 mod5=2 \u2192 yes, and n=25 mod5=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the number of losing positions up to n=2024 would be the count of numbers \u22642024 where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nSo, how many numbers \u22642024 are congruent to 0 mod5 or 2 mod5.\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nFor each modulus, the count is floor((2024 - r)/5) +1, where r is the remainder.\n\nFor r=0:\n\nNumbers are 5,10,15,... up to \u22642024.\n\nThe maximum multiple is floor(2024/5)=404.8 \u2192 404*5=2020. So 404 numbers.\n\nWait, wait, 5*404=2020, which is \u22642024. So 404 numbers.\n\nFor r=2:\n\nNumbers are 2,7,12,... up to \u22642024.\n\nThe sequence starts at 2, then 7,12,... The nth term is 5n -3.\n\nWait, wait, let's find the maximum k such that 5k +2 \u22642024.\n\nSo 5k \u22642022 \u2192 k \u22642022/5=404.4 \u2192 k=404.\n\nSo the last term is 5*404 +2=2022, which is \u22642024. So the count is 405, because starting from k=0 to k=404, which is 405 numbers.\n\nWait, wait, let me check: for r=2, the first number is 2=5*0 +2, then 7=5*1 +2, up to 5*404 +2=2022.\n\nSo the count is 405 numbers.\n\nWait, but 5*404=2020, 2020+2=2022. Next would be 2027, which is beyond 2024, so yes, 405 numbers.\n\nSo total losing positions are 404 (for r=0) +405 (for r=2) = 809.\n\nWait, but wait: 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so 404 full cycles.\n\nWait, but for r=0, the count is 404 (since 5*404=2020 \u22642024).\n\nFor r=2, the count is 405 because the last term is 2022, which is \u22642024. So 405 numbers.\n\nThus, total losing positions \u22642024: 404 + 405 = 809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check:\n\nFrom 0 mod5: numbers are 5,10,...,2020. That's 2020/5=404 numbers.\n\nFrom 2 mod5: numbers are 2,7,...,2022. How many terms?\n\nThe nth term is 5n-3=2,7,12,... So 5n-3 \u22642024 \u21925n \u22642027 \u2192n \u2264405.4 \u2192n=405. So 405 numbers.\n\nSo total is 404 +405=809.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive integers n \u22642024 where Bob can force a win is 809.\n\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game's winning and losing positions. A position \\( n \\) is losing if every possible move (removing 1 or 4 tokens) leads to a winning position for the opponent. Through analysis, we find that the losing positions are those where \\( n \\equiv 0 \\) or \\( 2 \\pmod{5} \\).\n\nCounting these positions up to 2024:\n- Numbers \\( \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\): There are 404 such numbers (5, 10, ..., 2020).\n- Numbers \\( \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\): There are 405 such numbers (2, 7, ..., 2022).\n\nAdding these, we find there are \\( 404 + 405 = 809 \\) losing positions.\n\n\\boxed{809}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out for which values of n the second player (Bob) can force a win. Since Alice goes first, Bob can only win if the starting position is a losing position for Alice. So, I should model this as a game where each position is either a winning or losing position. \n\nLet me start by analyzing small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nn = 1: Alice takes the 1 token and wins. So Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a losing position for Bob.\n\nn = 2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take that 1 token and win. Wait, no, because Alice would take 1, leaving 1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. But wait, Alice's goal is to win, so she might choose the optimal move. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. If n=2, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob then takes that 1 and wins. So Bob can win in this case. Or wait, does Alice have another option? She can take 1 or 4 tokens. But since n=2, she can't take 4. So she takes 1, leaving 1. Bob takes the last one and wins. So for n=2, Bob can win. Hmm, so n=2 is a winning position for Bob.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think in terms of Grundy numbers or something. Let me try to model this.\n\nIn combinatorial game theory, positions are either N-positions (next player can force a win) or P-positions (previous player can force a win). So, if a position is a P-position, the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.\n\nSo, for each n, I'll determine if it's a P-position or N-position.\n\nLet's list n from 0 upwards:\n\nn=0: Well, the game ends, so this is a losing position. So it's a P-position.\n\nn=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So it's an N-position.\n\nn=2: The player can take 1, leaving n=1 (which is an N-position for the opponent). Wait, if I take 1, opponent gets n=1, which is an N-position, meaning they can win. But wait, n=2: the player can take 1, leading to n=1 (N), which would mean the opponent can win. Alternatively, can the player take 4? No, because n=2 <4. So the player's only move is to n=1, which is an N-position. So if n=2 is a P-position? Because the player can only move to N-positions, meaning the current player can't force a win, making it a P-position. Wait, but earlier I thought n=2 is a winning position for Bob. Wait, no, in this case, n=2 is when it's Alice's turn. If n=2 is a P-position, that means the current player (Alice) cannot force a win, so Bob can win. So yes, n=2 is a P-position. So Bob can win when n=2.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nIf n is a P-position, the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, so the previous player can. So if n=2 is a P-position, that means Alice (the first player) cannot force a win, so Bob can. So yes, Bob can win for n=2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the definitions. Let me try to model it step by step.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- If from a position, all possible moves lead to N-positions, then the current position is a P-position.\n\n- If from a position, there exists at least one move leading to a P-position, then the current position is an N-position.\n\nSo starting from n=0, which is a P-position.\n\nn=1: From n=1, you can take 1 token to reach n=0 (a P-position). So n=1 is an N-position.\n\nn=2: From n=2, you can take 1 to reach n=1 (N-position). Are there any other moves? No, since 4 >2. So all moves from n=2 lead to N-positions. So n=2 is a P-position.\n\nn=3: From n=3, you can take 1 to reach n=2 (P-position). So since there's a move to a P-position, n=3 is an N-position.\n\nn=4: From n=4, you can take 1 to reach n=3 (N) or take 4 to reach n=0 (P). So because you can reach a P-position, n=4 is an N-position.\n\nn=5: From n=5, possible moves are to n=4 (N) or n=1 (N). Both are N-positions. So n=5 is a P-position.\n\nn=6: From n=6, you can take 1 to reach n=5 (P) or take 4 to reach n=2 (P). So n=6 is an N-position because you can move to P-positions.\n\nWait, no. Wait, n=5 is P, n=2 is P. So from n=6, you can move to P-positions, so n=6 is N.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the definition, if any move leads to a P-position, then the current position is N. So n=6 is N.\n\nn=7: From n=7, possible moves are to n=6 (N) or n=3 (N). So all moves lead to N-positions. So n=7 is a P-position.\n\nn=8: From n=8, you can take 1 to reach n=7 (P) or take 4 to reach n=4 (N). Since one move leads to P, n=8 is N.\n\nn=9: From n=9, take 1 to reach n=8 (N) or take 4 to reach n=5 (P). So n=9 is N because you can move to P.\n\nn=10: From n=10, you can take 1 to reach n=9 (N) or take 4 to reach n=6 (N). So all moves lead to N-positions. So n=10 is P.\n\nHmm, let's list these out:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14...\nP/N: P N P N N P N P N N P  ?\n\nWait, let me make a table:\n\nn | P/N\n0 | P\n1 | N\n2 | P\n3 | N\n4 | N\n5 | P\n6 | N\n7 | P\n8 | N\n9 | N\n10| P\n11| N\n12| ?\nLet's compute n=11:\n\nn=11: possible moves to n=10 (P) and n=7 (P). So from n=11, you can move to P-positions, so n=11 is N.\n\nn=12: possible moves are to n=11 (N) and n=8 (N). So all moves lead to N-positions. So n=12 is P.\n\nn=13: moves to n=12 (P) and n=9 (N). So can move to P, so n=13 is N.\n\nn=14: moves to n=13 (N) and n=10 (P). So n=14 is N because you can reach P.\n\nn=15: moves to n=14 (N) and n=11 (N). So all moves to N, so n=15 is P.\n\nn=16: moves to n=15 (P) and n=12 (P). So n=16 is N.\n\nn=17: moves to n=16 (N) and n=13 (N). So all moves to N, so n=17 is P.\n\nHmm, so let's see the pattern from n=0 to n=17:\n\nP at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,...\n\nLooking for a pattern: the differences between P positions are 2,3,2,3,2,3,2,...\n\nWait, 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17, etc.\n\nSo the P positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod 5? Wait, let's see:\n\nn=0: 0 mod5=0\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2\n\nn=5: 0 mod5=0\n\nn=7: 2 mod5=2\n\nn=10:0 mod5=0\n\nn=12: 2 mod5=2\n\nn=15:0 mod5=0\n\nn=17: 2 mod5=2.\n\nYes, that seems to fit. So P positions are n \u2261 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, let me check n=20: would it be P?\n\nn=20: 20 mod5=0, so yes, it's a P-position.\n\nn=22: 22 mod5=2, so yes, P.\n\nSo the P positions are numbers where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nIf that's the case, then for n \u22610 or 2 mod5, Bob can win.\n\nSo for n \u22642024, how many numbers \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo the count is equal to the number of n \u22642024 where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nSo how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5: floor(2024/5) +1 if 2024 is divisible by5.\n\n2024 divided by5 is 404.8, so 404 full multiples, and 2024 =5*404 +4. So the number of multiples of5 is 404.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5: from 2,7,12,... up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nThe largest n \u22612 mod5 \u22642024 is 2024- (2024 mod5). Wait, 2024 mod5 is 2024-5*404=2024-2020=4. So 2024 mod5=4. So the largest n\u22612 mod5 is 2024-2=2022.\n\nSo the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with first term 2, common difference5.\n\nNumber of terms: Let me compute.\n\nLet the nth term be a_n=2 + (k-1)*5 \u22642022.\n\nSo 2 +5(k-1) \u22642022 \u21925(k-1) \u22642020 \u2192k-1 \u2264404 \u2192k\u2264405.\n\nSo there are 405 terms for \u22612 mod5.\n\nSimilarly, for \u22610 mod5, we have 404 terms (from 5 to 2020, since 2020=5*404).\n\nWait, wait, 2020 is 5*404, so the numbers are 5,10,...,2020: which is 2020/5=404 terms.\n\nSo total P positions: 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5) =809.\n\nWait, but wait, n=0 is a P-position, but the problem states n is positive integers, so n\u22651.\n\nWait, in our initial analysis, n=0 is a P-position, but the problem is for n\u22651. So for n=1 to 2024.\n\nSo in the count for \u22610 mod5, n=5,10,...2020: 404 numbers.\n\nFor \u22612 mod5: n=2,7,...2022: 405 numbers.\n\nSo total is 404+405=809.\n\nSo the answer is 809.\n\nWait, but let me verify with the earlier small n.\n\nFor n=0: P (but not counted as n is positive)\n\nn=1: N\n\nn=2: P \u2192counted\n\nn=3: N\n\nn=4: N\n\nn=5: P \u2192counted\n\nn=6: N\n\nn=7: P \u2192counted\n\nn=8: N\n\nn=9: N\n\nn=10: P \u2192counted\n\nSo in 1-10, n=2,5,7,10: 4 numbers.\n\nFrom 1 to 10, that's 4 numbers where Bob can win.\n\nSo in each block of 5, there are 2 numbers (like 0 and 2 mod5, but 0 isn't counted).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out for which values of n the second player (Bob) can force a win. Since Alice goes first, Bob can only win if the starting position is a losing position for Alice. So, I should model this as a game where each position is either a winning or losing position. \n\nLet me start by analyzing small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nn = 1: Alice takes the 1 token and wins. So Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a losing position for Bob.\n\nn = 2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take that 1 token and win. Wait, no, because Alice would take 1, leaving 1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. But wait, Alice's goal is to win, so she might choose the optimal move. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. If n=2, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob then takes that 1 and wins. So Bob can win in this case. Or wait, does Alice have another option? She can take 1 or 4 tokens. But since n=2, she can't take 4. So she takes 1, leaving 1. Bob takes the last one and wins. So for n=2, Bob can win. Hmm, so n=2 is a winning position for Bob.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think in terms of Grundy numbers or something. Let me try to model this.\n\nIn combinatorial game theory, positions are either N-positions (next player can force a win) or P-positions (previous player can force a win). So, if a position is a P-position, the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.\n\nSo, for each n, I'll determine if it's a P-position or N-position.\n\nLet's list n from 0 upwards:\n\nn=0: Well, the game ends, so this is a losing position. So it's a P-position.\n\nn=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So it's an N-position.\n\nn=2: The player can take 1, leaving n=1 (which is an N-position for the opponent). Wait, if I take 1, opponent gets n=1, which is an N-position, meaning they can win. But wait, n=2: the player can take 1, leading to n=1 (N), which would mean the opponent can win. Alternatively, can the player take 4? No, because n=2 <4. So the player's only move is to n=1, which is an N-position. So if n=2 is a P-position? Because the player can only move to N-positions, meaning the current player can't force a win, making it a P-position. Wait, but earlier I thought n=2 is a winning position for Bob. Wait, no, in this case, n=2 is when it's Alice's turn. If n=2 is a P-position, that means the current player (Alice) cannot force a win, so Bob can win. So yes, n=2 is a P-position. So Bob can win when n=2.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nIf n is a P-position, the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, so the previous player can. So if n=2 is a P-position, that means Alice (the first player) cannot force a win, so Bob can. So yes, Bob can win for n=2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the definitions. Let me try to model it step by step.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- If from a position, all possible moves lead to N-positions, then the current position is a P-position.\n\n- If from a position, there exists at least one move leading to a P-position, then the current position is an N-position.\n\nSo starting from n=0, which is a P-position.\n\nn=1: From n=1, you can take 1 token to reach n=0 (a P-position). So n=1 is an N-position.\n\nn=2: From n=2, you can take 1 to reach n=1 (N-position). Are there any other moves? No, since 4 >2. So all moves from n=2 lead to N-positions. So n=2 is a P-position.\n\nn=3: From n=3, you can take 1 to reach n=2 (P-position). So since there's a move to a P-position, n=3 is an N-position.\n\nn=4: From n=4, you can take 1 to reach n=3 (N) or take 4 to reach n=0 (P). So because you can reach a P-position, n=4 is an N-position.\n\nn=5: From n=5, possible moves are to n=4 (N) or n=1 (N). Both are N-positions. So n=5 is a P-position.\n\nn=6: From n=6, you can take 1 to reach n=5 (P) or take 4 to reach n=2 (P). So n=6 is an N-position because you can move to P-positions.\n\nWait, no. Wait, n=5 is P, n=2 is P. So from n=6, you can move to P-positions, so n=6 is N.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the definition, if any move leads to a P-position, then the current position is N. So n=6 is N.\n\nn=7: From n=7, possible moves are to n=6 (N) or n=3 (N). So all moves lead to N-positions. So n=7 is a P-position.\n\nn=8: From n=8, you can take 1 to reach n=7 (P) or take 4 to reach n=4 (N). Since one move leads to P, n=8 is N.\n\nn=9: From n=9, take 1 to reach n=8 (N) or take 4 to reach n=5 (P). So n=9 is N because you can move to P.\n\nn=10: From n=10, you can take 1 to reach n=9 (N) or take 4 to reach n=6 (N). So all moves lead to N-positions. So n=10 is P.\n\nHmm, let's list these out:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14...\nP/N: P N P N N P N P N N P  ?\n\nWait, let me make a table:\n\nn | P/N\n0 | P\n1 | N\n2 | P\n3 | N\n4 | N\n5 | P\n6 | N\n7 | P\n8 | N\n9 | N\n10| P\n11| N\n12| ?\nLet's compute n=11:\n\nn=11: possible moves to n=10 (P) and n=7 (P). So from n=11, you can move to P-positions, so n=11 is N.\n\nn=12: possible moves are to n=11 (N) and n=8 (N). So all moves lead to N-positions. So n=12 is P.\n\nn=13: moves to n=12 (P) and n=9 (N). So can move to P, so n=13 is N.\n\nn=14: moves to n=13 (N) and n=10 (P). So n=14 is N because you can reach P.\n\nn=15: moves to n=14 (N) and n=11 (N). So all moves to N, so n=15 is P.\n\nn=16: moves to n=15 (P) and n=12 (P). So n=16 is N.\n\nn=17: moves to n=16 (N) and n=13 (N). So all moves to N, so n=17 is P.\n\nHmm, so let's see the pattern from n=0 to n=17:\n\nP at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,...\n\nLooking for a pattern: the differences between P positions are 2,3,2,3,2,3,2,...\n\nWait, 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17, etc.\n\nSo the P positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod 5? Wait, let's see:\n\nn=0: 0 mod5=0\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2\n\nn=5: 0 mod5=0\n\nn=7: 2 mod5=2\n\nn=10:0 mod5=0\n\nn=12: 2 mod5=2\n\nn=15:0 mod5=0\n\nn=17: 2 mod5=2.\n\nYes, that seems to fit. So P positions are n \u2261 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, let me check n=20: would it be P?\n\nn=20: 20 mod5=0, so yes, it's a P-position.\n\nn=22: 22 mod5=2, so yes, P.\n\nSo the P positions are numbers where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nIf that's the case, then for n \u22610 or 2 mod5, Bob can win.\n\nSo for n \u22642024, how many numbers \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo the count is equal to the number of n \u22642024 where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nSo how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5: floor(2024/5) +1 if 2024 is divisible by5.\n\n2024 divided by5 is 404.8, so 404 full multiples, and 2024 =5*404 +4. So the number of multiples of5 is 404.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5: from 2,7,12,... up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nThe largest n \u22612 mod5 \u22642024 is 2024- (2024 mod5). Wait, 2024 mod5 is 2024-5*404=2024-2020=4. So 2024 mod5=4. So the largest n\u22612 mod5 is 2024-2=2022.\n\nSo the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with first term 2, common difference5.\n\nNumber of terms: Let me compute.\n\nLet the nth term be a_n=2 + (k-1)*5 \u22642022.\n\nSo 2 +5(k-1) \u22642022 \u21925(k-1) \u22642020 \u2192k-1 \u2264404 \u2192k\u2264405.\n\nSo there are 405 terms for \u22612 mod5.\n\nSimilarly, for \u22610 mod5, we have 404 terms (from 5 to 2020, since 2020=5*404).\n\nWait, wait, 2020 is 5*404, so the numbers are 5,10,...,2020: which is 2020/5=404 terms.\n\nSo total P positions: 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5) =809.\n\nWait, but wait, n=0 is a P-position, but the problem states n is positive integers, so n\u22651.\n\nWait, in our initial analysis, n=0 is a P-position, but the problem is for n\u22651.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each time. Alice goes first. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, so this is a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that these types of problems often involve figuring out winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, the key here is to determine for which n Bob can force a win. Since Bob is the second player, that would mean n is a losing position for Alice, meaning no matter what Alice does, Bob can always respond in a way that leads him to victory.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Maybe I can create a sequence where each position is either a winning (W) or losing (L) position. The base case would be n=0, which is a losing position because the player can't make a move. Wait, but in this game, the person who takes the last token wins. So n=0 would mean the previous player has already taken the last token and won. So, n=0 is a losing position for the current player.\n\nLet me start building the sequence step by step.\n\nn=0: L (since the player can't move)\nn=1: The current player can take 1 token and win, so W.\nn=2: Take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, which is a W position. Wait, no\u2014if I take 1 from n=2, opponent is left with n=1, which is a W for them. So, does that mean n=2 is a losing position? Wait, no, because taking 1 leaves opponent in W, but maybe the current player can choose to take 4, but wait n=2 is less than 4, so they can't take 4. So, for n=2, the current player can only take 1, leaving n=1, which is a W for the opponent. So, does that mean n=2 is a losing position? Hmm, but wait, the current player can take 1, opponent takes the last one and wins. So, n=2 would be a losing position for the current player. So, n=2 is L.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's make a table.\n\nn | outcome\n0 | L\n1 | W\n2 | ?\n3 | ?\n4 | ?\n5 | ?\n6 | ?\n... etc.\n\nLet me fill in n=1. At n=1, you can take 1 and win, so W.\n\nn=2: You can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is W. So, if you take 1, opponent can win. So, since all moves from n=2 lead to opponent's W, n=2 is L.\n\nn=3: You can take 1, leaving n=2 (L) for the opponent. So, if you take 1, opponent is in a losing position. So, n=3 is W.\n\nn=4: You can take 1, leaving n=3 (W), or take 4, leaving n=0 (L). So, if you take 4, opponent is left with L. Therefore, n=4 is W.\n\nn=5: You can take 1, leaving n=4 (W), or take 4, leaving n=1 (W). So, all moves from n=5 leave opponent in W positions. So, n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: You can take 1, leaving n=5 (L), so opponent is in losing position. So, n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: Take 1, leaving n=6 (W), or take 4, leaving n=3 (W). So, all moves from n=7 lead to opponent's W. So, n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: Take 1, leaving n=7 (L). So, opponent is in losing position. Therefore, n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: Take 1, leaving n=8 (W), or take 4, leaving n=5 (L). So, taking 4 leaves opponent in L. So, n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: Take 1, leaving n=9 (W), or take 4, leaving n=6 (W). So, all moves lead to opponent's W. So, n=10 is L.\n\nHmm, so let me list the outcomes:\n\nn : outcome\n0 : L\n1 : W\n2 : L\n3 : W\n4 : W\n5 : L\n6 : W\n7 : L\n8 : W\n9 : W\n10: L\n\nLooking for a pattern here. Let's list the positions and see if there's a cycle or periodicity.\n\nLooking at the sequence from n=0:\n\nL, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L,...\n\nWait, so the pattern seems to repeat every 5 numbers? Let me check:\n\nn=0: L\nn=1: W\nn=2: L\nn=3: W\nn=4: W\nn=5: L\nn=6: W\nn=7: L\nn=8: W\nn=9: W\nn=10: L\nn=11: W\nn=12: L\nn=13: W\nn=14: W\nn=15: L\n...\n\nYes, it seems like the pattern is L, W, L, W, W, and then repeats. So every 5 numbers, the pattern L, W, L, W, W repeats.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nn mod 5:\n\nn=0: 0 mod5=0 \u2192 L\nn=1:1 mod5=1 \u2192 W\nn=2:2 mod5=2 \u2192 L\nn=3:3 mod5=3 \u2192 W\nn=4:4 mod5=4 \u2192 W\nn=5:0 \u2192 L\nn=6:1 \u2192 W\nn=7:2 \u2192 L\nn=8:3 \u2192 W\nn=9:4 \u2192 W\nn=10:0 \u2192 L\n...\n\nYes, so the pattern is based on n mod 5. So:\n\nIf n mod5 is 0, 2, or 3 \u2192 W?\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, for n=0, mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=1 \u21921 \u2192 W\n\nn=2 \u21922 \u2192 L\n\nn=3 \u21923 \u2192 W\n\nn=4 \u21924 \u2192 W\n\nn=5 \u21920 \u2192 L\n\nn=6 \u21921 \u2192 W\n\nn=7 \u21922 \u2192 L\n\nn=8 \u21923 \u2192 W\n\nn=9 \u21924 \u2192 W\n\nn=10 \u21920 \u2192 L\n\nSo, the losing positions (L) are when n mod5 is 0 or 2. Wait, n=2 is 2 mod5=2, n=5 is 0 mod5=0, n=7 is 2 mod5=2, n=10 is 0 mod5=0, etc.\n\nSo, the losing positions are when n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, but n=5:5 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=2:2 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=7:7 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=15:15 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nSo, yes, it seems that positions where n \u22610 or 2 mod5 are losing positions.\n\nSo, for n \u22610 or 2 mod5, the current player is in a losing position if both players play optimally.\n\nSo, in the context of the problem, Bob can win if and only if the starting position is a losing position for Alice, i.e., n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the number of positive integers n \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, now, the task is to count how many numbers \u22642024 are congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, for each modulus, we can compute how many numbers \u22642024 satisfy the condition.\n\nFirst, let's find how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5.\n\nThe numbers are 5,10,15,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nThe maximum multiple of 5 \u22642024 is floor(2024/5)*5.\n\n2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so floor is 404. 404*5=2020.\n\nSo, number of multiples of 5 is 404 (since 5*1, 5*2,...,5*404=2020).\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5.\n\nThese are 2,7,12,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nThe sequence is 2 +5k, where k\u22650.\n\nWhat's the maximum such number \u22642024?\n\nLet's find the maximum k where 2+5k \u22642024.\n\n5k \u22642022 \u2192k \u22642022/5=404.4 \u2192k=404.\n\nSo, the maximum number is 2+5*404=2+2020=2022.\n\nSo, how many terms are there?\n\nStarting from k=0: 2+5*0=2, up to k=404:2022.\n\nNumber of terms is 405 (since k starts at 0).\n\nSo, total numbers \u22610 or 2 mod5 are 404 + 405= 809.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me confirm.\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5: from 5 to 2020, inclusive. So, that's 2020/5=404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5: starting at 2,7,...,2022.\n\nThe number of terms is ((2022 -2)/5)+1 = (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.\n\nSo, 404 +405=809.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me check if 2024 is included.\n\nWait, 2024 mod5 is 2024/5=404*5=2020, remainder 4. So 2024\u22614 mod5.\n\nSo, the numbers \u22642024 include all up to 2024. So, in the case of numbers \u22610 mod5, the last is 2020, which is \u22642024. For numbers \u22612 mod5, the last is 2022, which is \u22642024.\n\nSo, the counts are correct.\n\nSo, total numbers where Bob can force a win is 809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me compute how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5.\n\nNumber of multiples of 5 up to 2024 is floor(2024/5)=404, since 5*404=2020.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5: the first is 2, the last is 2022. The count is ((2022-2)/5)+1 = (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.\n\nSo, total is 404 +405=809.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 809.\n\nBut wait, let me check if n=0 is considered. The problem states positive integers n \u22642024, so n starts at 1.\n\nWait, in the above counts, numbers \u22610 mod5 start at 5, which is positive. Numbers \u22612 mod5 start at 2, which is positive. So, the counts of 404 and 405 are correct, as they start at 5 and 2 respectively, which are positive.\n\nSo, yes, 809 is the correct count.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5. So, for each n, if n mod5 is 0 or 2, Bob can win. So, the numbers are 2,5,7,10,12,...,2020,2022.\n\nWait, but wait, n=2 is a losing position. So, when n=2, Alice goes first. She can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. Or she can't take 4 because n=2<4. So, she takes 1, leaving n=1 for Bob, who can take it and win. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.\n\nSimilarly, n=5: Alice can take 1, leaving 4 (which is a winning position for Bob because Bob can take 4 and win). Or she can take 4, leaving 1, which is a winning position for Bob. So, either way, Bob can win.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in n=5, if Alice takes 4, she leaves n=1, which is a winning position for Bob, meaning Bob can take the last token and win. So, if Alice takes 4, Bob wins. If Alice takes 1, she leaves n=4 for Bob, which is a winning position for Bob because Bob can take all 4 and win. So, in both cases, Bob can win. So, n=5 is a losing position for Alice.\n\nSo, yes, the initial analysis is correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of positive integers n \u22642024 where Bob can guarantee a win is 809.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each time. Alice goes first. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, so this is a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that these types of problems often involve figuring out winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, the key here is to determine for which n Bob can force a win. Since Bob is the second player, that would mean n is a losing position for Alice, meaning no matter what Alice does, Bob can always respond in a way that leads him to victory.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Maybe I can create a sequence where each position is either a winning (W) or losing (L) position. The base case would be n=0, which is a losing position because the player can't make a move. Wait, but in this game, the person who takes the last token wins. So n=0 would mean the previous player has already taken the last token and won. So, n=0 is a losing position for the current player.\n\nLet me start building the sequence step by step.\n\nn=0: L (since the player can't move)\nn=1: The current player can take 1 token and win, so W.\nn=2: Take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, which is a W position. Wait, no\u2014if I take 1 from n=2, opponent is left with n=1, which is a W for them. So, does that mean n=2 is a losing position? Wait, no, because taking 1 leaves opponent in W, but maybe the current player can choose to take 4, but wait n=2 is less than 4, so they can't take 4. So, for n=2, the current player can only take 1, leaving n=1, which is a W for the opponent. So, does that mean n=2 is a losing position? Hmm, but wait, the current player can take 1, opponent takes the last one and wins. So, n=2 would be a losing position for the current player. So, n=2 is L.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's make a table.\n\nn | outcome\n0 | L\n1 | W\n2 | ?\n3 | ?\n4 | ?\n5 | ?\n6 | ?\n... etc.\n\nLet me fill in n=1. At n=1, you can take 1 and win, so W.\n\nn=2: You can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is W. So, if you take 1, opponent can win. So, since all moves from n=2 lead to opponent's W, n=2 is L.\n\nn=3: You can take 1, leaving n=2 (L) for the opponent. So, if you take 1, opponent is in a losing position. So, n=3 is W.\n\nn=4: You can take 1, leaving n=3 (W), or take 4, leaving n=0 (L). So, if you take 4, opponent is left with L. Therefore, n=4 is W.\n\nn=5: You can take 1, leaving n=4 (W), or take 4, leaving n=1 (W). So, all moves from n=5 leave opponent in W positions. So, n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: You can take 1, leaving n=5 (L), so opponent is in losing position. So, n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: Take 1, leaving n=6 (W), or take 4, leaving n=3 (W). So, all moves from n=7 lead to opponent's W. So, n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: Take 1, leaving n=7 (L). So, opponent is in losing position. Therefore, n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: Take 1, leaving n=8 (W), or take 4, leaving n=5 (L). So, taking 4 leaves opponent in L. So, n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: Take 1, leaving n=9 (W), or take 4, leaving n=6 (W). So, all moves lead to opponent's W. So, n=10 is L.\n\nHmm, so let me list the outcomes:\n\nn : outcome\n0 : L\n1 : W\n2 : L\n3 : W\n4 : W\n5 : L\n6 : W\n7 : L\n8 : W\n9 : W\n10: L\n\nLooking for a pattern here.

The count is ((2022-2)/5)+1 = (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.\n\nSo, total is 404 +405=809.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 809.\n\nBut wait, let me check if n=0 is considered.

They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, let's see. This sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that these types of problems often involve finding winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, in this case, Alice goes first. If n is a losing position for Alice, then Bob can win. So I need to find all n \u2264 2024 where n is a losing position for the first player (Alice), meaning Bob can win.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's define the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). The base case is when n=0, which is a losing position because the player can't make a move. But wait, in this game, the player who takes the last token wins. So if n=1, the first player takes 1 and wins. Similarly, n=4, the first player can take 4 and win. So for n=1, it's a W position. For n=2, the first player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Wait, that's not right. Wait, n=2: if Alice takes 1, Bob is left with 1 and takes it to win. So Alice would instead take 1, but that would let Bob win. Wait, no, wait: if n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. So Alice would lose. Alternatively, can Alice take 4? No, because n=2 is less than 4. So Alice can't take 4. So for n=2, Alice can only take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. Wait, but that would mean n=2 is an L position.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let's think step by step.\n\nLet me list the positions from n=0 upwards and mark them as W or L.\n\nn=0: losing position (since you can't move)\nn=1: you can take 1, so it's a W position.\nn=2: you can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who then wins. So if you take 1, opponent takes 1 and wins. So n=2 is an L position because whatever move you make, opponent can win.\nWait, no, if n=2, you can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. So you lose. So n=2 is L.\nn=3: you can take 1, leaving 2 (which is L for the opponent). So if you take 1, opponent is in L, so you can force a win. So n=3 is W.\nn=4: you can take 4, so you win immediately. So n=4 is W.\nn=5: you can take 1, leaving 4 (W for opponent). Or take 4, leaving 1 (W for opponent). So no matter what you do, opponent can win. So n=5 is L.\nn=6: you can take 1, leaving 5 (L for opponent), which would mean opponent loses. So n=6 is W.\nn=7: take 1, leaving 6 (W for opponent), or take 4, leaving 3 (W for opponent). So both options leave opponent in W positions. So n=7 is L.\nWait, but wait, when you take 1 from 7, you leave 6, which is W, so opponent can win. Alternatively, taking 4 leaves 3, which is W. So opponent can win either way. So n=7 is L.\nn=8: you can take 1, leaving 7 (L for opponent). So n=8 is W because you can force opponent into L.\nn=9: take 1, leaving 8 (W), or take 4, leaving 5 (L). So if you take 4, opponent is at 5 (L), so you can force opponent to lose. So n=9 is W.\nn=10: take 1, leaving 9 (W), or take 4, leaving 6 (W). So both moves leave opponent in W positions.

At n=5, if you take 1, opponent gets 4 (W), so opponent can take 4 and win. If you take 4, opponent gets 1 (W), which they take and win. So n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: taking 1 leaves 5 (L), so opponent can't win. So n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: taking 1 leaves 6 (W), opponent can win. Taking 4 leaves 3 (W), opponent can win. So n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: taking 1 leaves 7 (L), so opponent loses. So n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: taking 4 leaves 5 (L), opponent loses. So n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: taking 1 leaves 9 (W), opponent can win. Taking 4 leaves 6 (W), opponent can win. So n=10 is L.\n\nn=11: taking 1 leaves 10 (L), so opponent loses. So n=11 is W.\n\nn=12: taking 1 leaves 11 (W), taking 4 leaves 8 (W). So both moves leave opponent in W. So n=12 is L.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check n=12 again. Taking 1 leaves 11 (W), so opponent can take 4, leaving 7 (L). Wait, but if you take 1, leaving 11, which is W. The opponent can then take 4, leaving 7 (L). So opponent can force a win. Alternatively, if you take 4 from 12, leaving 8 (W), opponent can take 1, leaving 7 (L). So in both cases, the opponent can force you into a losing position. So n=12 is L.\n\nWait, so the pattern so far is: W at n=1,3,4,6,8,9,11. L at n=0,2,5,7,10,12.\n\nWait, maybe there's a cycle here. Let me see the positions:\n\nLooking at the L positions: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,...\n\nWait, let's see the differences between the L positions:\n\n2-0=2\n\n5-2=3\n\n7-5=2\n\n10-7=3\n\n12-10=2\n\n15-12=3\n\n17-15=2\n\nSo it's alternating between adding 2 and 3.

If n=13, can I make a move that leaves opponent in L?\n\nPossible moves: take 1, leaving 12 (L). So n=13 is W because you can leave opponent in L.\n\nn=14: take 1, leaving 13 (W), take 4, leaving 10 (L). So if you take 4, opponent is at 10 (L). So n=14 is W.\n\nn=15: taking 1 leaves 14 (W), taking 4 leaves 11 (W). So both moves leave opponent in W. So n=15 is L.\n\nYes, so n=15 is L.

So Bob can win when n is 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nBut wait, n=0 is a losing position, but the problem starts with n\u22651. So the losing positions for the first player (Alice) are n\u22610 or 2 mod5, for n\u22651.\n\nWait, but let me check n=5: yes, 5 mod5=0, and it's a losing position.\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2, losing.\n\nn=7:7 mod5=2, losing.\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0, losing.\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2, losing.\n\nn=15:15 mod5=0, losing.\n\nYes, so the losing positions are n\u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo for the problem, we need to count the numbers n \u22642024 where n\u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to finding the number of integers \u22642024 where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nLet me compute how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5.\n\nThe number of multiples of 5 up to 2024: floor(2024/5) = 404.8, so 404 numbers.

So 404 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5: the sequence is 2,7,12,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nThe first term is 2, the last term \u22642024: let's compute 2024 \u00f75.\n\n2024 =5*404 +4, so 5*404=2020. So the last term \u22612 mod5 is 2020 +2=2022.\n\nSo the number of terms is 404 +1=405? Wait, wait, let's see.\n\nWait, the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is given by ((last - first)/step) +1.\n\nFirst term a=2, last term l=2022, step d=5.\n\nNumber of terms: ((2022 -2)/5)+1 = (2020/5)+1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo numbers \u22610 mod5: 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5: 405 numbers.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check for n=2024: 2024 mod5 is 4, since 2025 is 5*405, so 2024 is 2025-1, so mod5 is 4.\n\nSo the last term \u22612 mod5 is 2022, which is 2020+2=2022, which is \u22642024.\n\nSo for \u22610 mod5, the count is 404 (from 5 to 2020), but wait, does 0 count? No, because n starts at 1. So for n\u22610 mod5, the numbers are 5,10,...,2020. That's 2020/5=404 numbers.\n\nFor n\u22612 mod5, the numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, let's see. This sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that these types of problems often involve finding winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, in this case, Alice goes first. If n is a losing position for Alice, then Bob can win. So I need to find all n \u2264 2024 where n is a losing position for the first player (Alice), meaning Bob can win.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's define the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). The base case is when n=0, which is a losing position because the player can't make a move. But wait, in this game, the player who takes the last token wins. So if n=1, the first player takes 1 and wins. Similarly, n=4, the first player can take 4 and win. So for n=1, it's a W position. For n=2, the first player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Wait, that's not right. Wait, n=2: if Alice takes 1, Bob is left with 1 and takes it to win. So Alice would instead take 1, but that would let Bob win. Wait, no, wait: if n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. So Alice would lose. Alternatively, can Alice take 4? No, because n=2 is less than 4. So Alice can't take 4. So for n=2, Alice can only take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. Wait, but that would mean n=2 is an L position.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let's think step by step.\n\nLet me list the positions from n=0 upwards and mark them as W or L.\n\nn=0: losing position (since you can't move)\nn=1: you can take 1, so it's a W position.\nn=2: you can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who then wins. So if you take 1, opponent takes 1 and wins. So n=2 is an L position because whatever move you make, opponent can win.\nWait, no, if n=2, you can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. So you lose. So n=2 is L.\nn=3: you can take 1, leaving 2 (which is L for the opponent). So if you take 1, opponent is in L, so you can force a win. So n=3 is W.\nn=4: you can take 4, so you win immediately. So n=4 is W.\nn=5: you can take 1, leaving 4 (W for opponent). Or take 4, leaving 1 (W for opponent). So no matter what you do, opponent can win. So n=5 is L.\nn=6: you can take 1, leaving 5 (L for opponent), which would mean opponent loses. So n=6 is W.\nn=7: take 1, leaving 6 (W for opponent), or take 4, leaving 3 (W for opponent).

So n=8 is W because you can force opponent into L.\nn=9: take 1, leaving 8 (W), or take 4, leaving 5 (L). So if you take 4, opponent is at 5 (L), so you can force opponent to lose.

So, for Bob to have a winning strategy, whatever Alice does, Bob can counter in a way that ensures he takes the last token.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to model the game using the concept of winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, let's define the positions:\n\n- If n = 0, the game is over, so the player who just moved wins. But since n=0 isn't a move for the current player, maybe we can consider n=0 as a losing position because there are no moves left.\n\nWait, no, actually, if it's your turn and there are 0 tokens, you lose because you can't make a move. So n=0 is a losing position.\n\nNow, let's consider small n and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nn=1: Alice can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice, meaning it's a losing position for Bob. So Bob can't win here.\n\nn=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for Bob. Bob can then take the last token and win. Wait, no, Alice's move leaves n=1 for Bob, so Bob can take 1 and win. But wait, if Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1 and wins. But Alice might prefer to take 4, but wait, n=2, she can't take 4, so she has to take 1. So n=2, Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1 and wins. So n=2 is a winning position for Bob? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the player who takes the last token wins. So if n=2, Alice takes 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So n=2 is a winning position for Alice? Wait, no. Wait, let me re-examine.\n\nWait, in n=2: Alice's turn. She can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob can then take the last token and win. So if Alice takes 1, Bob wins. Alternatively, can Alice take 4? No, because n=2 <4, so she can't. So Alice's only option is to take 1, leading to Bob's victory. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob. Wait, no, wait. If Alice is at n=2, she has to take 1, and Bob wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, which means it's a winning position for Bob. So Bob can win when n=2.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model each n as either a winning (W) or losing (L) position, where W means the current player can force a win, and L means the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.\n\nSo, let's build a table:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10...\nResult: L W ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\nn=0: L (current player can't move, so loses)\n\nn=1: Current player can take 1, leaving 0 for opponent, who loses. So W.\n\nn=2: Current player can take 1, leaving 1 for opponent. The opponent is at W, so they can win. So if current player takes 1, opponent can win. Are there other options? No, because 4 is more than 2. So current player has to take 1, leading to opponent's W. So current player is in a losing position, so n=2 is L.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So n=2 is L.\n\nn=3: Current player can take 1, leaving n=2 (L) for opponent. So opponent is in L, so current player can win by taking 1. So n=3 is W.\n\nn=4: Current player can take 4, leaving 0, so opponent loses. So n=4 is W.\n\nn=5: Current player can take 1, leaving 4 (W) for opponent, or take 4, leaving 1 (W) for opponent. Wait, but if the current player takes 1, opponent is at W, which means opponent can win. If current player takes 4, opponent is at W as well. So both options leave opponent at W, so current player is in L. So n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: Current player can take 1, leaving 5 (L) for opponent. So opponent is in L, so current player can win by taking 1. So n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: Current player can take 1, leaving 6 (W), or take 4, leaving 3 (W). Wait, both options leave opponent at W, so current player can't force a win. So n=7 is L.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me check again. If n=7, current player can take 1, leaving 6 (W), which is opponent's turn. If the opponent is at W, they can win. So current player's move leads to opponent's W. Alternatively, take 4, leaving 3 (W), same outcome. So current player can't force opponent into L, so n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: Current player can take 1, leaving 7 (L), so opponent is in L. So current player can win by taking 1. So n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: Current player can take 1, leaving 8 (W), or take 4, leaving 5 (L). Oh! So if current player takes 4 from 9, leaving 5, which is L for opponent. So opponent can't win from 5. So n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: Current player can take 1, leaving 9 (W), or take 4, leaving 6 (W). Both options leave opponent at W, so current player can't force a win. So n=10 is L.\n\nHmm, let me list these out:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16...\nResult: L W L W W L W L W W L  ?\n\nWait, let's see the pattern so far:\n\nLooking at the results:\n\nn: 0 \u2192 L\n\n1 \u2192 W\n\n2 \u2192 L\n\n3 \u2192 W\n\n4 \u2192 W\n\n5 \u2192 L\n\n6 \u2192 W\n\n7 \u2192 L\n\n8 \u2192 W\n\n9 \u2192 W\n\n10 \u2192 L\n\n11: Let's compute.\n\nn=11: current player can take 1 (leaves 10, which is L) or 4 (leaves 7, which is L). So if current player takes 1, opponent is at L (n=10). So current player can win by taking 1. So n=11 is W.\n\nWait, but wait, n=10 is L, so if current player leaves opponent at L, current player can win. So n=11 is W.\n\nn=12: current player can take 1 (leaves 11, W) or 4 (leaves 8, W). Both options leave opponent at W, so current player can't force a win. So n=12 is L.\n\nn=13: current player can take 1 (leaves 12, L) or 4 (leaves 9, W). So if current player takes 1, opponent is at L. So n=13 is W.\n\nn=14: current player can take 1 (leaves 13, W) or 4 (leaves 10, L). So if current player takes 4, opponent is at L. So n=14 is W.\n\nn=15: current player can take 1 (leaves 14, W) or 4 (leaves 11, W). Both options leave opponent at W. So n=15 is L.\n\nn=16: current player can take 1 (leaves 15, L) or 4 (leaves 12, L). So current player can win by taking 1 or 4, leading opponent to L. So n=16 is W.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tedious, but maybe I can see a pattern here. Let's list the results again up to n=16:\n\nn | Result\n\n0 | L\n\n1 | W\n\n2 | L\n\n3 | W\n\n4 | W\n\n5 | L\n\n6 | W\n\n7 | L\n\n8 | W\n\n9 | W\n\n10 | L\n\n11 | W\n\n12 | L\n\n13 | W\n\n14 | W\n\n15 | L\n\n16 | W\n\nHmm, looking at the L positions so far: n=0, 2,5,7,10,12,15. Let's see the differences between these:\n\n0 to 2: +2\n\n2 to5: +3\n\n5 to7:+2\n\n7 to10:+3\n\n10 to12:+2\n\n12 to15:+3\n\n15 to17: probably +2, but let's check n=17.\n\nn=17: current player can take 1 (leaves 16, W) or 4 (leaves 13, W). Both options leave opponent at W, so n=17 is L.\n\nYes, so n=17 is L.\n\nSo the L positions are at 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17, etc. It seems like the pattern is adding 2 and 3 alternately.\n\nSo starting from 0:\n\n0 \u2192 +2 \u2192 2 \u2192 +3 \u21925 \u2192 +2 \u21927 \u2192 +3 \u219210 \u2192 +2 \u219212 \u2192 +3 \u219215 \u2192 +2 \u219217 \u2192 +3 \u219220 \u2192 etc.\n\nSo the L positions are at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,30, etc.\n\nSo the pattern is that every 5 numbers, the L positions occur at 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27, etc. So the cycle is 5 numbers, with L positions at 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17, etc.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to model this as a periodic sequence. Let's see if the L positions occur every 5 numbers, but perhaps with a different offset.\n\nLooking at the L positions:\n\n0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,...\n\nSo the difference alternates between +2 and +3.\n\nSo 0 \u2192 2 (+2), 2 \u21925 (+3),5\u21927 (+2),7\u219210 (+3), etc.\n\nSo the sequence is built by alternately adding 2 and 3.\n\nSo, for the L positions, each L is either 2 more than the previous or 3 more.\n\nSo, the general form could be that for each L position, it's either 2 or 3 more than the previous, alternating.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a formula for the L positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the losing positions are those where n \u2261 0 or 2 mod 5, but looking at the list:\n\nn=0: 0 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=2:2 mod5=2\u2192L\n\nn=5:5 mod5=0\u2192L\n\nn=7:7 mod5=2\u2192L\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0\u2192L\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2\u2192L\n\nn=15:15 mod5=0\u2192L\n\nn=17:17 mod5=2\u2192L\n\nYes, that seems to fit. So the L positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, for n \u22650, if n mod5 is 0 or 2, it's a losing position.\n\nLet me check n=20:20 mod5=0\u2192L.\n\nn=22:22 mod5=2\u2192L.\n\nn=25:25 mod5=0\u2192L.\n\nn=27:27 mod5=2\u2192L.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier pattern.\n\nSo, in our problem, Bob can win if and only if the starting position is a losing position for Alice, which is when n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nBut wait, in our initial analysis, n=0 is a losing position, but n=0 isn't a valid starting position because the game starts with n\u22651.\n\nSo for n\u22651, the losing positions are n\u22612 mod5 and n\u22610 mod5 (but n\u22655 for n\u22610 mod5, except n=0 which isn't a valid starting point).\n\nWait, but n=5 is a losing position, and 5 mod5=0. So yes, n=5 is L.\n\nSo, the losing positions for the starting player (Alice) are n\u22610 or 2 mod5, for n\u22650, but since n starts at 1, the losing positions are n=2,5,7,10,12,15,17, etc.\n\nSo, the number of n \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the count would be the number of integers \u22642024 where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nSo, how many numbers \u22642024 are congruent to 0 mod5? That's floor(2024/5) = 404 (since 5\u00d7404=2020, and 2024-2020=4, so 404 numbers).\n\nSimilarly, numbers congruent to 2 mod5: let's see, the first is 2, then 7,12,... up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nThe largest number \u22642024 that is 2 mod5 is 2022, since 2022=5\u00d7404 +2=2020+2=2022.\n\nSo, the count is the same as for 0 mod5, but let's check:\n\nThe numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nThe number of terms is given by the formula: (last - first)/step +1.\n\nSo, (2022 -2)/5 +1= (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nWait, but 5\u00d7404=2020, so 2020+2=2022 is indeed the last term. So numbers congruent to 2 mod5: 405 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, numbers congruent to 0 mod5: up to 2020, which is 2020/5=404 numbers.\n\nSo total losing positions for Alice are 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5) =809.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this.\n\nWait, n=0 is included in the 0 mod5 count, but since n starts at 1, n=0 isn't part of our problem. So for 0 mod5, the numbers are 5,10,15,...,2020, which is 404 numbers (since 2020=5\u00d7404).\n\nFor 2 mod5, numbers start at 2,7,12,...,2022, which is 405 numbers, as calculated.\n\nSo total losing positions for Alice:404+405=809.\n\nWait, but let me check n=2024:2024 mod5.\n\n2024 divided by5 is 404\u00d75=2020, remainder4. So 2024=5\u00d7404 +4, so 2024 mod5=4. So 2024 is not a losing position.\n\nSo, the maximum losing position is 2022 (2 mod5) and 2020 (0 mod5).\n\nSo, the total number of losing positions is 404 (0 mod5) +405 (2 mod5)=809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts.\n\nFor 0 mod5:\n\nThe first n\u22651 is 5, last is 2020.\n\nNumber of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1= (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nFor 2 mod5:\n\nFirst n=2, last n=2022.\n\nNumber of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo total losing positions for Alice (where Bob can win) are 404+405=809.\n\nSo the answer is 809.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is it correct that when n is a losing position, Bob can win? Because if Alice starts at a losing position, then Bob can win. So yes, the count is 809.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n",

Both options leave opponent at W, so n=17 is L.\n\nYes, so n=17 is L.\n\nSo the L positions are at 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17, etc. It seems like the pattern is adding 2 and 3 alternately.\n\nSo starting from 0:\n\n0 \u2192 +2 \u2192 2 \u2192 +3 \u21925 \u2192 +2 \u21927 \u2192 +3 \u219210 \u2192 +2 \u219212 \u2192 +3 \u219215 \u2192 +2 \u219217 \u2192 +3 \u219220 \u2192 etc.\n\nSo the L positions are at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,30, etc.\n\nSo the pattern is that every 5 numbers, the L positions occur at 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27, etc. So the cycle is 5 numbers, with L positions at 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17, etc.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to model this as a periodic sequence. Let's see if the L positions occur every 5 numbers, but perhaps with a different offset.\n\nLooking at the L positions:\n\n0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,...\n\nSo the difference alternates between +2 and +3.\n\nSo 0 \u2192 2 (+2), 2 \u21925 (+3),5\u21927 (+2),7\u219210 (+3), etc.\n\nSo the sequence is built by alternately adding 2 and 3.\n\nSo, for the L positions, each L is either 2 more than the previous or 3 more.\n\nSo, the general form could be that for each L position, it's either 2 or 3 more than the previous, alternating.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a formula for the L positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the losing positions are those where n \u2261 0 or 2 mod 5, but looking at the list:\n\nn=0: 0 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=2:2 mod5=2\u2192L\n\nn=5:5 mod5=0\u2192L\n\nn=7:7 mod5=2\u2192L\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0\u2192L\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2\u2192L\n\nn=15:15 mod5=0\u2192L\n\nn=17:17 mod5=2\u2192L\n\nYes, that seems to fit. So the L positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, for n \u22650, if n mod5 is 0 or 2, it's a losing position.\n\nLet me check n=20:20 mod5=0\u2192L.\n\nn=22:22 mod5=2\u2192L.\n\nn=25:25 mod5=0\u2192L.\n\nn=27:27 mod5=2\u2192L.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier pattern.\n\nSo, in our problem, Bob can win if and only if the starting position is a losing position for Alice, which is when n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nBut wait, in our initial analysis, n=0 is a losing position, but n=0 isn't a valid starting position because the game starts with n\u22651.\n\nSo for n\u22651, the losing positions are n\u22612 mod5 and n\u22610 mod5 (but n\u22655 for n\u22610 mod5, except n=0 which isn't a valid starting point).\n\nWait, but n=5 is a losing position, and 5 mod5=0. So yes, n=5 is L.\n\nSo, the losing positions for the starting player (Alice) are n\u22610 or 2 mod5, for n\u22650, but since n starts at 1, the losing positions are n=2,5,7,10,12,15,17, etc.\n\nSo, the number of n \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the count would be the number of integers \u22642024 where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nSo, how many numbers \u22642024 are congruent to 0 mod5? That's floor(2024/5) = 404 (since 5\u00d7404=2020, and 2024-2020=4, so 404 numbers).\n\nSimilarly, numbers congruent to 2 mod5: let's see, the first is 2, then 7,12,... up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nThe largest number \u22642024 that is 2 mod5 is 2022, since 2022=5\u00d7404 +2=2020+2=2022.\n\nSo, the count is the same as for 0 mod5, but let's check:\n\nThe numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nThe number of terms is given by the formula: (last - first)/step +1.\n\nSo, (2022 -2)/5 +1= (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nWait, but 5\u00d7404=2020, so 2020+2=2022 is indeed the last term. So numbers congruent to 2 mod5: 405 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, numbers congruent to 0 mod5: up to 2020, which is 2020/5=404 numbers.\n\nSo total losing positions for Alice are 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5) =809.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this.\n\nWait, n=0 is included in the 0 mod5 count, but since n starts at 1, n=0 isn't part of our problem. So for 0 mod5, the numbers are 5,10,15,...,2020, which is 404 numbers (since 2020=5\u00d7404).\n\nFor 2 mod5, numbers start at 2,7,12,...,2022, which is 405 numbers, as calculated.\n\nSo total losing positions for Alice:404+405=809.\n\nWait, but let me check n=2024:2024 mod5.\n\n2024 divided by5 is 404\u00d75=2020, remainder4. So 2024=5\u00d7404 +4, so 2024 mod5=4. So 2024 is not a losing position.\n\nSo, the maximum losing position is 2022 (2 mod5) and 2020 (0 mod5).\n\nSo, the total number of losing positions is 404 (0 mod5) +405 (2 mod5)=809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts.\n\nFor 0 mod5:\n\nThe first n\u22651 is 5, last is 2020.\n\nNumber of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1= (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nFor 2 mod5:\n\nFirst n=2, last n=2022.\n\nNumber of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo total losing positions for Alice (where Bob can win) are 404+405=809.\n\nSo the answer is 809.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is it correct that when n is a losing position, Bob can win? Because if Alice starts at a losing position, then Bob can win. So yes, the count is 809.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game's winning and losing positions. A losing position is one where the current player cannot force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves.\n\nWe start by examining small values of \\( n \\) and classifying each as a winning (W) or losing (L) position:\n\n- \\( n = 0 \\): L (no moves possible)\n- \\( n = 1 \\): W (take 1 token to win)\n- \\( n = 2 \\): L (only move is to take 1, leaving \\( n = 1 \\) for the opponent, who wins)\n- \\( n = 3 \\): W (take 1, leaving \\( n = 2 \\), an L position for the opponent)\n- \\( n = 4 \\): W (take 4 tokens to win)\n- \\( n = 5 \\): L (any move leaves the opponent at a W position)\n- \\( n = 6 \\): W (take 1, leaving \\( n = 5 \\), an L position)\n- \\( n = 7 \\): L (any move leaves the opponent at a W position)\n- \\( n = 8 \\): W (take 1, leaving \\( n = 7 \\), an L position)\n- \\( n = 9 \\): W (take 4, leaving \\( n = 5 \\), an L position)\n- \\( n = 10 \\): L (any move leaves the opponent at a W position)\n\nContinuing this analysis, we observe a pattern: the losing positions occur at \\( n \\equiv 0 \\) or \\( 2 \\pmod{5} \\). This pattern holds for all \\( n \\geq 0 \\).\n\nTo find the count of such \\( n \\) values up to 2024:\n\n1. **Numbers \\( \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\):** These are 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020. The count is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2024}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 404 \\).\n\n2. **Numbers \\( \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\):** These are 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022. The count is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2022 - 2}{5} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 405 \\).\n\nAdding these, the total number of losing positions (where Bob can win) is \\( 404 + 405 = 809 \\).\n\n**Answer:** The number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) where Bob can guarantee a win is \\(\\boxed{809}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, let's start by understanding the game mechanics. Since Alice goes first, Bob's chance to win depends on the initial number of tokens. So, I guess I need to figure out for which n Bob can force a win, regardless of Alice's moves.\n\nThis seems like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I remember something about winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, let's define the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). If a player is in a position where they can move to a losing position for the opponent, then that's a winning position for them. Conversely, if all possible moves lead to winning positions for the opponent, then the current position is a losing one.\n\nThe base case would be when there are 0 tokens left. But wait, in the game, the person who takes the last token wins. So if there are 0 tokens, the game has already ended, and the player who just took the last token wins. So, the player facing 0 tokens has lost because they can't make a move. Wait, maybe I should clarify this.\n\nLet me think: When n=0, it means the game has already been won by the previous player. So, for n=0, it's a losing position because you can't make a move. Now, let's think about n=1. The player can take 1 token and win, so n=1 is a winning position.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, the player can take 1 token, leaving 1 token for the opponent. Since n=1 is a winning position, the opponent can then take that 1 token and win. So, wait, if I leave the opponent with a winning position, that's bad for me. So, is n=2 a losing position? Let me check.\n\nWait, when n=2, the player can take 1 token, leaving 1 token. The opponent can then take that 1 token and win. Alternatively, the player could take 4 tokens, but there's only 2, so that's not possible. So, the only move is to take 1, which leads the opponent to a winning position. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position.\n\nWait, but if the player is at n=2, they can take 1, leaving n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So, n=2 is a losing position because any move leads to the opponent winning. So, n=2 is L.\n\nSimilarly, n=3: The player can take 1, leaving n=2, which is L. So, if the player takes 1, the opponent is left with L, meaning the player can force a win. Therefore, n=3 is W.\n\nn=4: The player can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So, n=4 is W.\n\nn=5: The player can take 1, leaving n=4, which is W for the opponent. Or take 4, leaving n=1, which is W for the opponent. So, both options leave the opponent in a W position. Therefore, n=5 is L.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if I take 1 from 5, leaving 4, which is W. So the opponent can win. If I take 4, leaving 1, which is W as well. So, no matter what I do, opponent can win. So, n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: Let's see. The player can take 1, leaving n=5, which is L. So, opponent is left in a losing position. Therefore, n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: Take 1, leaving n=6 (W). Take 4, leaving n=3 (W). Both options leave opponent in W. So, n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: Take 1, leaving n=7 (L). So, opponent is in L, meaning n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: Take 1, leaving n=8 (W). Take 4, leaving n=5 (L). Oh, so if the player takes 4 from 9, leaving 5, which is L. So, the opponent is in a losing position. So, n=9 is W.\n\nWait, so n=9 is W because you can take 4 and leave the opponent with L.\n\nn=10: Let's see. Take 1, leaving n=9 (W). Take 4, leaving n=6 (W). Both options leave opponent in W. So, n=10 is L.\n\nn=11: Take 1, leaving n=10 (L). So, opponent is in L, so n=11 is W.\n\nn=12: Take 1, leaving n=11 (W). Take 4, leaving n=8 (W). Both moves leave opponent in W, so n=12 is L.\n\nn=13: Take 1, leaving n=12 (L). So, opponent is in L, so n=13 is W.\n\nn=14: Take 1, leaving n=13 (W). Take 4, leaving n=10 (L). So, if I take 4, opponent is in L. Therefore, n=14 is W.\n\nWait, so n=14 is W because you can take 4 and leave the opponent in L.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tedious, but maybe there's a pattern here. Let's list the positions:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\nResult: L W L W W L W L W W L W L W W L W L W W L\n\nWait, maybe I should write down the results for the first few numbers to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nWait, I think I messed up earlier. Let me recompute from n=0 to, say, n=15.\n\nn=0: L (can't move)\nn=1: can take 1, win. So W.\nn=2: can only take 1, leaving 1 (W). So opponent can win. So n=2 is L.\nn=3: take 1, leave 2 (L). So opponent is in L, so n=3 is W.\nn=4: take 4 and win. W.\nn=5: take 1 \u2192 4 (W). take 4 \u2192 1 (W). So both moves lead to opponent W. So n=5 is L.\nn=6: take 1 \u2192 5 (L). So opponent is in L. So n=6 is W.\nn=7: take 1 \u2192 6 (W). take 4 \u2192 3 (W). Both moves lead to opponent W. So n=7 is L.\nn=8: take 1 \u21927 (L). So opponent is in L. So n=8 is W.\nn=9: take 1 \u21928 (W). take 4 \u21925 (L). So if you take 4, opponent is in L. So n=9 is W.\nn=10: take 1 \u21929 (W). take 4 \u21926 (W). Both moves lead to opponent W. So n=10 is L.\nn=11: take 1 \u219210 (L). So opponent is in L. So n=11 is W.\nn=12: take 1 \u219211 (W). take 4 \u21928 (W). Both moves lead to opponent W. So n=12 is L.\nn=13: take 1 \u219212 (L). So opponent is in L. So n=13 is W.\nn=14: take 1 \u219213 (W). take 4 \u219210 (L). So if you take 4, opponent is in L. So n=14 is W.\nn=15: take 1 \u219214 (W). take 4 \u219211 (W). Both moves lead to opponent W. So n=15 is L.\n\nWait, so let me list the results again:\n\nn | Result\n0 | L\n1 | W\n2 | L\n3 | W\n4 | W\n5 | L\n6 | W\n7 | L\n8 | W\n9 | W\n10| L\n11| W\n12| L\n13| W\n14| W\n15| L\n\nHmm, looking at the pattern, it seems like every 5 numbers, the L positions occur. Wait, let's see:\n\nFrom n=0: L\nn=1: W\nn=2: L\nn=3: W\nn=4: W\nn=5: L\nn=6: W\nn=7: L\nn=8: W\nn=9: W\nn=10: L\nn=11: W\nn=12: L\nn=13: W\nn=14: W\nn=15: L\n\nSo, the losing positions are at n=0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,...\n\nHmm, looking at the differences between these numbers:\n\n2 - 0 = 2\n5 - 2 = 3\n7 -5 = 2\n10 -7 =3\n12 -10=2\n15 -12=3\n\nSo, the losing positions are alternately spaced by 2 and 3. So, the sequence is 0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... etc.\n\nWait, that seems to be a pattern. Let me check n=16 and n=17.\n\nn=16: take 1 \u219215 (L). So opponent is in L. So n=16 is W.\n\nn=17: take 1 \u219216 (W). take 4 \u219213 (W). Both moves lead to opponent W. So n=17 is L.\n\nn=18: take 1 \u219217 (L). So opponent is in L. So n=18 is W.\n\nn=19: take 1 \u219218 (W). take 4 \u219215 (L). So, if you take 4, opponent is in L. So n=19 is W.\n\nn=20: take 1 \u219219 (W). take 4 \u219216 (W). Both moves lead to opponent W. So n=20 is L.\n\nSo, adding to the list:\n\nn=16: W\n\nn=17: L\n\nn=18: W\n\nn=19: W\n\nn=20: L\n\nSo, the losing positions are at 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nYes, the pattern seems to hold. So, every time we add 2, then 3, then 2, then 3, etc.\n\nSo, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nn=0: 0 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=5: 5 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=7: 7 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=15:15 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=17:17 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=20:20 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nYes! So, the losing positions are n \u2261 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, if n mod5 is 0 or 2, then it's a losing position. So, Bob can win when n is a losing position because Alice is forced to move from a losing position to a winning one, allowing Bob to always bring it back to a losing position.\n\nWait, but wait, in our earlier analysis, n=5 is L, which is 0 mod5.\n\nn=2 is L, which is 2 mod5.\n\nSimilarly, n=7 is 2 mod5 (7-5=2), so 7 mod5=2.\n\nn=10 is 0 mod5.\n\nSo, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, for n \u22642024, how many numbers are \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the count is the number of n \u22642024 where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nSo, the number of such n is equal to the number of multiples of 5 up to 2024 plus the number of numbers \u22612 mod5 up to 2024.\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst, the number of multiples of 5 up to 2024.\n\nThat's floor(2024/5). Let's compute 2024 \u00f75.\n\n5\u00d7404=2020. So, 404 multiples of 5 (including 0? Wait, but n starts from 1, so the multiples are 5,10,...,2020. So, 2020 is 5\u00d7404. So, the number is 404.\n\nWait, but wait: 5\u00d71=5, 5\u00d72=10,...,5\u00d7404=2020. So, 404 numbers.\n\nNext, the numbers \u22612 mod5 up to 2024.\n\nThese are 2,7,12,..., up to the largest number \u22642024.\n\nWhat's the largest number \u22612 mod5 \u22642024?\n\n2024 divided by5: 2024=5\u00d7404 +4. So, the last number \u22612 mod5 is 5\u00d7404 +2=2020 +2=2022.\n\nSo, the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nHow many terms are there?\n\nThe nth term is 5n -3? Wait, let's see.\n\nWait, first term a=2, common difference d=5.\n\nSo, the nth term is a_n = a + (n-1)*d =2 +5(n-1)=5n-3.\n\nWe set 5n -3 \u22642024 \u21925n \u22642027 \u2192n \u22642027/5=405.4.\n\nSo, n=405.\n\nWait, but let's check 5\u00d7405 -3=2025-3=2022, which is \u22642024. So, yes, 405 terms.\n\nSo, the number of numbers \u22612 mod5 is 405.\n\nSo, total losing positions are 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5)=809.\n\nBut wait, n starts from 1. So, n=0 is not counted. So, the multiples of5 start at5, which is n=5, and go up to2020, which is 5\u00d7404. So, 404 numbers.\n\nThe numbers \u22612 mod5 start at2, which is n=2, and go up to2022, which is 2 mod5. So, 405 numbers.\n\nSo, total is 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but wait, in the first part, n=0 is not counted because n starts at1. So, when we count multiples of5 from5 to2020, it's 404 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for \u22612 mod5, from2 to2022, which is 405 numbers.\n\nSo, 404+405=809.\n\nBut let me double-check: from1 to2024, the numbers \u22610 mod5:5,10,...,2020. The count is (2020)/5=404.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5:2,7,12,...,2022. The count is (2022-2)/5 +1= (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo, yes, 404+405=809.\n\nBut wait, wait. The problem says \"positive integers n less than or equal to2024\". So, n=0 is excluded. So, 809 is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier, in our analysis, the losing positions are n\u22610 or2 mod5, starting from n=0, but n=0 isn't included. So, yes, the count is 809.\n\nSo, the answer is809.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because in the initial analysis, when n=0, it's a losing position, but since the game starts at n\u22651, n=0 is not a starting position. So, the losing positions for n\u22651 are n\u22612 mod5 and n\u22610 mod5, starting from n=2,5,7,10, etc.\n\nSo, the count is indeed 809.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in my earlier list, n=2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... are losing positions.\n\nSo, the number of losing positions up to2024 is indeed 809.\n\nSo, the answer is809.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, let's start by understanding the game mechanics. Since Alice goes first, Bob's chance to win depends on the initial number of tokens. So, I guess I need to figure out for which n Bob can force a win, regardless of Alice's moves.\n\nThis seems like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I remember something about winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, let's define the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). If a player is in a position where they can move to a losing position for the opponent, then that's a winning position for them. Conversely, if all possible moves lead to winning positions for the opponent, then the current position is a losing one.\n\nThe base case would be when there are 0 tokens left. But wait, in the game, the person who takes the last token wins. So if there are 0 tokens, the game has already ended, and the player who just took the last token wins. So, the player facing 0 tokens has lost because they can't make a move. Wait, maybe I should clarify this.\n\nLet me think: When n=0, it means the game has already been won by the previous player. So, for n=0, it's a losing position because you can't make a move. Now, let's think about n=1. The player can take 1 token and win, so n=1 is a winning position.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, the player can take 1 token, leaving 1 token for the opponent. Since n=1 is a winning position, the opponent can then take that 1 token and win. So, wait, if I leave the opponent with a winning position, that's bad for me. So, is n=2 a losing position? Let me check.\n\nWait, when n=2, the player can take 1 token, leaving 1 token. The opponent can then take that 1 token and win. Alternatively, the player could take 4 tokens, but there's only 2, so that's not possible. So, the only move is to take 1, which leads the opponent to a winning position. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position.\n\nWait, but if the player is at n=2, they can take 1, leaving n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So, n=2 is a losing position because any move leads to the opponent winning. So, n=2 is L.\n\nSimilarly, n=3: The player can take 1, leaving n=2, which is L. So, if the player takes 1, the opponent is left with L, meaning the player can force a win. Therefore, n=3 is W.\n\nn=4: The player can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So, n=4 is W.\n\nn=5: The player can take 1, leaving n=4, which is W for the opponent. Or take 4, leaving n=1, which is W for the opponent. So, both options leave the opponent in a W position. Therefore, n=5 is L.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if I take 1 from 5, leaving 4, which is W. So the opponent can win. If I take 4, leaving 1, which is W as well. So, no matter what I do, opponent can win. So, n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: Let's see. The player can take 1, leaving n=5, which is L. So, opponent is left in a losing position. Therefore, n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: Take 1, leaving n=6 (W). Take 4, leaving n=3 (W). Both options leave opponent in W. So, n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: Take 1, leaving n=7 (L). So, opponent is in L, meaning n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: Take 1, leaving n=8 (W). Take 4, leaving n=5 (L). Oh, so if the player takes 4 from 9, leaving 5, which is L. So, the opponent is in a losing position. So, n=9 is W.\n\nWait, so n=9 is W because you can take 4 and leave the opponent with L.\n\nn=10: Let's see. Take 1, leaving n=9 (W). Take 4, leaving n=6 (W). Both options leave opponent in W. So, n=10 is L.\n\nn=11: Take 1, leaving n=10 (L). So, opponent is in L, so n=11 is W.\n\nn=12: Take 1, leaving n=11 (W). Take 4, leaving n=8 (W). Both moves leave opponent in W, so n=12 is L.\n\nn=13: Take 1, leaving n=12 (L). So, opponent is in L, so n=13 is W.\n\nn=14: Take 1, leaving n=13 (W). Take 4, leaving n=10 (L). So, if I take 4, opponent is in L. Therefore, n=14 is W.\n\nWait, so n=14 is W because you can take 4 and leave the opponent in L.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tedious, but maybe there's a pattern here. Let's list the positions:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\nResult: L W L W W L W L W W L W L W W L W L W W L\n\nWait, maybe I should write down the results for the first few numbers to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nWait, I think I messed up earlier. Let me recompute from n=0 to, say, n=15.\n\nn=0: L (can't move)\nn=1: can take 1, win. So W.\nn=2: can only take 1, leaving 1 (W). So opponent can win. So n=2 is L.\nn=3: take 1, leave 2 (L). So opponent is in L, so n=3 is W.\nn=4: take 4 and win. W.\nn=5: take 1 \u2192 4 (W). take 4 \u2192 1 (W). So both moves lead to opponent W. So n=5 is L.\nn=6: take 1 \u2192 5 (L). So opponent is in L. So n=6 is W.\nn=7: take 1 \u2192 6 (W). take 4 \u2192 3 (W). Both moves lead to opponent W. So n=7 is L.\nn=8: take 1 \u21927 (L). So opponent is in L. So n=8 is W.\nn=9: take 1 \u21928 (W). take 4 \u21925 (L). So if you take 4, opponent is in L. So n=9 is W.\nn=10: take 1 \u21929 (W). take 4 \u21926 (W). Both moves lead to opponent W. So n=10 is L.\nn=11: take 1 \u219210 (L). So opponent is in L. So n=11 is W.\nn=12: take 1 \u219211 (W). take 4 \u21928 (W). Both moves lead to opponent W. So n=12 is L.\nn=13: take 1 \u219212 (L). So opponent is in L. So n=13 is W.\nn=14: take 1 \u219213 (W). take 4 \u219210 (L). So if you take 4, opponent is in L. So n=14 is W.\nn=15: take 1 \u219214 (W). take 4 \u219211 (W). Both moves lead to opponent W. So n=15 is L.\n\nWait, so let me list the results again:\n\nn | Result\n0 | L\n1 | W\n2 | L\n3 | W\n4 | W\n5 | L\n6 | W\n7 | L\n8 | W\n9 | W\n10| L\n11| W\n12| L\n13| W\n14| W\n15| L\n\nHmm, looking at the pattern, it seems like every 5 numbers, the L positions occur. Wait, let's see:\n\nFrom n=0: L\nn=1: W\nn=2: L\nn=3: W\nn=4: W\nn=5: L\nn=6: W\nn=7: L\nn=8: W\nn=9: W\nn=10: L\nn=11: W\nn=12: L\nn=13: W\nn=14: W\nn=15: L\n\nSo, the losing positions are at n=0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,...\n\nHmm, looking at the differences between these numbers:\n\n2 - 0 = 2\n5 - 2 = 3\n7 -5 = 2\n10 -7 =3\n12 -10=2\n15 -12=3\n\nSo, the losing positions are alternately spaced by 2 and 3. So, the sequence is 0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... etc.\n\nWait, that seems to be a pattern. Let me check n=16 and n=17.\n\nn=16: take 1 \u219215 (L). So opponent is in L. So n=16 is W.\n\nn=17: take 1 \u219216 (W). take 4 \u219213 (W). Both moves lead to opponent W. So n=17 is L.\n\nn=18: take 1 \u219217 (L). So opponent is in L. So n=18 is W.\n\nn=19: take 1 \u219218 (W). take 4 \u219215 (L). So, if you take 4, opponent is in L. So n=19 is W.\n\nn=20: take 1 \u219219 (W). take 4 \u219216 (W). Both moves lead to opponent W. So n=20 is L.\n\nSo, adding to the list:\n\nn=16: W\n\nn=17: L\n\nn=18: W\n\nn=19: W\n\nn=20: L\n\nSo, the losing positions are at 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nYes, the pattern seems to hold. So, every time we add 2, then 3, then 2, then 3, etc.\n\nSo, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nn=0: 0 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=5: 5 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=7: 7 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=15:15 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=17:17 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=20:20 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nYes! So, the losing positions are n \u2261 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, if n mod5 is 0 or 2, then it's a losing position. So, Bob can win when n is a losing position because Alice is forced to move from a losing position to a winning one, allowing Bob to always bring it back to a losing position.\n\nWait, but wait, in our earlier analysis, n=5 is L, which is 0 mod5.\n\nn=2 is L, which is 2 mod5.\n\nSimilarly, n=7 is 2 mod5 (7-5=2), so 7 mod5=2.\n\nn=10 is 0 mod5.\n\nSo, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, for n \u22642024, how many numbers are \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the count is the number of n \u22642024 where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nSo, the number of such n is equal to the number of multiples of 5 up to 2024 plus the number of numbers \u22612 mod5 up to 2024.\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst, the number of multiples of 5 up to 2024.\n\nThat's floor(2024/5). Let's compute 2024 \u00f75.\n\n5\u00d7404=2020. So, 404 multiples of 5 (including 0? Wait, but n starts from 1, so the multiples are 5,10,...,2020. So, 2020 is 5\u00d7404. So, the number is 404.\n\nWait, but wait: 5\u00d71=5, 5\u00d72=10,...,5\u00d7404=2020. So, 404 numbers.\n\nNext, the numbers \u22612 mod5 up to 2024.\n\nThese are 2,7,12,..., up to the largest number \u22642024.\n\nWhat's the largest number \u22612 mod5 \u22642024?\n\n2024 divided by5: 2024=5\u00d7404 +4. So, the last number \u22612 mod5 is 5\u00d7404 +2=2020 +2=2022.\n\nSo, the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nHow many terms are there?\n\nThe nth term is 5n -3? Wait, let's see.\n\nWait, first term a=2, common difference d=5.\n\nSo, the nth term is a_n = a + (n-1)*d =2 +5(n-1)=5n-3.\n\nWe set 5n -3 \u22642024 \u21925n \u22642027 \u2192n \u22642027/5=405.4.\n\nSo, n=405.\n\nWait, but let's check 5\u00d7405 -3=2025-3=2022, which is \u22642024. So, yes, 405 terms.\n\nSo, the number of numbers \u22612 mod5 is 405.\n\nSo, total losing positions are 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5)=809.\n\nBut wait, n starts from 1. So, n=0 is not counted. So, the multiples of5 start at5, which is n=5, and go up to2020, which is 5\u00d7404. So, 404 numbers.\n\nThe numbers \u22612 mod5 start at2, which is n=2, and go up to2022, which is 2 mod5. So, 405 numbers.\n\nSo, total is 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but wait, in the first part, n=0 is not counted because n starts at1. So, when we count multiples of5 from5 to2020, it's 404 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for \u22612 mod5, from2 to2022, which is 405 numbers.\n\nSo, 404+405=809.\n\nBut let me double-check: from1 to2024, the numbers \u22610 mod5:5,10,...,2020. The count is (2020)/5=404.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5:2,7,12,...,2022. The count is (2022-2)/5 +1= (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo, yes, 404+405=809.\n\nBut wait, wait. The problem says \"positive integers n less than or equal to2024\". So, n=0 is excluded. So, 809 is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier, in our analysis, the losing positions are n\u22610 or2 mod5, starting from n=0, but n=0 isn't included. So, yes, the count is 809.\n\nSo, the answer is809.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because in the initial analysis, when n=0, it's a losing position, but since the game starts at n\u22651, n=0 is not a starting position. So, the losing positions for n\u22651 are n\u22612 mod5 and n\u22610 mod5, starting from n=2,5,7,10, etc.\n\nSo, the count is indeed 809.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in my earlier list, n=2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... are losing positions.\n\nSo, the number of losing positions up to2024 is indeed 809.\n\nSo, the answer is809.\n\n\nThe problem involves Alice and Bob playing a game where they take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of \\( n \\) tokens.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 where Bob has a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, let me think. This sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that these types of problems often involve finding winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite\u2014the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.\n\nSo, the goal is to find all n \u2264 2024 where the starting position (n) is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can always win.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's denote the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). The base case is when there are no tokens left, but in this game, the player who takes the last token wins. So, if there are 0 tokens, the game is over. So, the positions before that would be the last move.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\n- If n=0, the game is already over. So, the player who just moved has won. So, for n=1, the player can take 1 token and win. Similarly, for n=4, the player can take 4 tokens and win.\n\nBut in this case, since players can take 1 or 4, the losing positions would be those where no matter if you take 1 or 4, you leave the opponent in a winning position.\n\nSo, let me start by listing out the positions for small n and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nn=0: game ends, previous player wins.\n\nn=1: current player takes 1 and wins. So W.\n\nn=2: current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is a W position. So the opponent can win. Wait, but if the current player takes 1, opponent is left with 1, which is a W position, meaning opponent can win. Alternatively, can the current player take 4? No, because n=2 <4. So, current player can only take 1, leaving opponent at n=1 (W). So, n=2 is a losing position for the current player. Wait, no\u2014wait, if the current player can force the opponent into a losing position, then n=2 is a winning position.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think again. Let's define for each n, whether it's a winning (current player can force a win) or losing (current player will lose if opponent plays optimally) position.\n\nBase case: n=0 is a losing position because the player who just moved won.\n\nn=1: current player takes 1, wins. So W.\n\nn=2: current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is a W position. So opponent can win. Alternatively, current player could take 1 and let opponent win. Wait, that's not good. Wait, no, the current player wants to leave the opponent in a losing position.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think recursively.\n\nIf from the current n, the current player can move to a position that's losing for the opponent, then the current n is a winning position. Otherwise, it's a losing position.\n\nSo, for n=0: losing (game over, previous player won).\n\nn=1: can take 1, leading to n=0, which is a losing position for the opponent. So n=1 is a winning position.\n\nn=2: possible moves lead to n=1 (W) or n= -2 (invalid, so only n=1 is possible). So, since all possible moves from n=2 lead to W positions for the opponent, n=2 is a losing position for the current player.\n\nWait, so n=2 is losing.\n\nn=3: possible moves are to n=2 (L) or n=-1 (invalid). So, by moving to n=2 (which is L for opponent), current player can force opponent into losing position. So n=3 is a winning position.\n\nn=4: possible moves are to n=3 (W) or n=0 (L). So, current player can take 4 tokens, leaving opponent with n=0, which is a losing position. So n=4 is a winning position.\n\nn=5: possible moves to n=4 (W) or n=1 (W). Both are winning positions for opponent. So, n=5 is a losing position.\n\nWait, let's summarize:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n\nResult: L W L W W L ? ? ? ? ? ...\n\nWait, let me compute n=6.\n\nn=6: possible moves are to n=5 (L) or n=2 (L). Wait, n=6-4=2, which is L. So current player can move to n=5 or n=2, both L positions. Wait, that means current player can force opponent into a losing position, so n=6 is W.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my previous conclusion. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, n=5 is L. So, from n=6, the current player can take 1, leaving n=5 (L) for the opponent. So, yes, n=6 is a winning position.\n\nWait, but wait: n=6, taking 1 leaves n=5 (L), so opponent is in losing position. So n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: possible moves are to n=6 (W) or n=3 (W). Both are W positions for opponent. So n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: possible moves to n=7 (L) or n=4 (W). So, current player can take 1, leaving opponent at n=7 (L). So n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: possible moves to n=8 (W) or n=5 (L). So current player can take 4, leaving opponent at n=5 (L). So n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: possible moves to n=9 (W) or n=6 (W). Both are W for opponent. So n=10 is L.\n\nWait, so the pattern so far is:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nResult: L W L W W L W L W W L\n\nHmm, looking for a pattern. Let's list the losing positions: n=0,2,5,7,10...\n\nWait, the losing positions seem to be at 0, 2, 5,7,10. Let's see the differences:\n\n2-0=2, 5-2=3,7-5=2,10-7=3. Hmm, alternating differences of 2 and 3. So next would be 10+2=12, 12+3=15, 15+2=17, etc.\n\nLet me check n=11: from n=11, possible moves are to n=10 (L) or n=7 (L). So current player can take 1, leaving opponent at n=10 (L). So n=11 is W.\n\nn=12: possible moves to n=11 (W) or n=8 (W). Both W for opponent, so n=12 is L.\n\nYes, that fits the pattern. So the losing positions are n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,... and so on.\n\nSo the losing positions are numbers that are either 2 mod 5 or 0 mod 5? Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, the losing positions are 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,... Let me see:\n\n0: 0 mod 5=0\n\n2: 2 mod 5=2\n\n5: 5 mod 5=0\n\n7: 7 mod 5=2\n\n10:10 mod5=0\n\n12:12 mod5=2\n\n15:15 mod5=0\n\n17:17 mod5=2\n\n20:20 mod5=0\n\n22:22 mod5=2\n\nSo, yes, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So n \u22610 or 2 mod5 are losing positions.\n\nBut wait, let's confirm with n=14.\n\nn=14: possible moves to n=13 (W) or n=10 (L). So current player can take 4, leaving n=10 (L), so n=14 is W.\n\nn=15: possible moves to n=14 (W) or n=11 (W). Both W for opponent, so n=15 is L. Which is 15 mod5=0, yes.\n\nn=16: possible moves to n=15 (L) or n=12 (L). So current player can take 1, leaving n=15 (L). So n=16 is W.\n\nn=17: possible moves to n=16 (W) or n=13 (W). So n=17 is L.\n\nYes, the pattern continues. So, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, for n \u22650, if n mod5 is 0 or 2, then it's a losing position.\n\nWait, but let's check n=1: 1 mod5=1 \u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2 \u2192 L, correct.\n\nn=3: 3 mod5=3 \u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=4:4 mod5=4 \u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=5:0 \u2192 L, correct.\n\nn=6:1 \u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=7:2 \u2192 L, correct.\n\nn=8:3 \u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=9:4 \u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=10:0 \u2192 L, correct.\n\nYes, seems consistent.\n\nSo, the losing positions are when n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the number of positive integers n \u22642024 where n is a losing position for Alice, i.e., n is a losing position. So n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, we need to count numbers \u22642024 where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nTotal numbers in 1 to2024: 2024 numbers.\n\nNumbers where n mod5=0: floor(2024/5). Let's calculate 2024 \u00f75.\n\n5*404=2020, so 2024=5*404 +4. So numbers divisible by5 up to2024:404 numbers (from 5,10,...2020).\n\nNumbers where n mod5=2: Let's see.\n\nThe numbers are 2,7,12,... up to \u22642024.\n\nThe first term is 2, common difference 5.\n\nWhat is the last term \u22642024?\n\n2024 \u00f75=404.8, so 5*404=2020. So 2020+2=2022 is \u22642024, but 2022+5=2027>2024. So the last term is 2022.\n\nNumber of terms: ((2022 -2)/5) +1 = (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nNumber of terms in an arithmetic sequence is given by ((last - first)/d) +1.\n\nFirst term a=2, d=5, last term l=2022.\n\nNumber of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1 = 2020/5 +1 =404 +1=405.\n\nSo, numbers \u22610 mod5:404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5:405 numbers.\n\nTotal losing positions:404+405=809.\n\nBut wait, n starts from 1. So n=0 is not included. Wait, the problem says positive integers n \u22642024. So n starts from 1.\n\nWait, n=0 is not considered. So, for mod5=0, n=5,10,...2020:404 numbers.\n\nFor mod5=2, n=2,7,12,...2022:405 numbers.\n\nSo total losing positions:404+405=809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, 2024 divided by5 is 404.8, so 404 full cycles, each contributing 1 number for mod5=0 and 1 for mod5=2.\n\nBut for mod5=2, the last term is 2022, which is 2022=5*404 +2=2020+2=2022. So yes, 405 terms.\n\nSimilarly, mod5=0:5*404=2020, so 404 terms.\n\nThus, total is 404+405=809.\n\nWait, but let's check for n=2024.\n\nn=2024: 2024 mod5=2024-5*404=2024-2020=4. So 2024\u22614 mod5, which is a winning position.\n\nSo, yes, the last term for mod5=2 is 2022, which is within 2024.\n\nHence, the total number of losing positions is 809.\n\nBut wait, let me think again: 404 numbers for mod5=0, 405 for mod5=2. 404+405=809.\n\nIs that the correct count?\n\nAlternatively, let's think about how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nEach block of 5 numbers has exactly two such numbers: one \u22610 and one \u22612.\n\nTotal blocks: 2024//5=404 blocks, each contributing 2 numbers. So 404*2=808.\n\nBut wait, 404 blocks would cover up to 5*404=2020. Then, from 2021 to2024: 2021,2022,2023,2024.\n\nIn this last partial block, which numbers are \u22610 or 2 mod5?\n\n2021 mod5=1, 2022 mod5=2, 2023 mod5=3,2024 mod5=4.\n\nSo only 2022 is \u22612 mod5. So in the last partial block, we have one more number (2022) which is \u22612 mod5.\n\nSo total numbers: 404*2 +1=809.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the number of positive integers n \u22642024 where Bob can guarantee a win is 809.\n\nWait, but let me check n=0. Since n starts at 1, n=0 isn't counted, so the mod5=0 starts at 5, which is correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 809.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 where Bob has a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, let me think. This sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that these types of problems often involve finding winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite\u2014the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.\n\nSo, the goal is to find all n \u2264 2024 where the starting position (n) is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can always win.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's denote the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). The base case is when there are no tokens left, but in this game, the player who takes the last token wins. So, if there are 0 tokens, the game is over. So, the positions before that would be the last move.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\n- If n=0, the game is already over. So, the player who just moved has won. So, for n=1, the player can take 1 token and win. Similarly, for n=4, the player can take 4 tokens and win.\n\nBut in this case, since players can take 1 or 4, the losing positions would be those where no matter if you take 1 or 4, you leave the opponent in a winning position.\n\nSo, let me start by listing out the positions for small n and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nn=0: game ends, previous player wins.\n\nn=1: current player takes 1 and wins. So W.\n\nn=2: current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is a W position. So the opponent can win. Wait, but if the current player takes 1, opponent is left with 1, which is a W position, meaning opponent can win. Alternatively, can the current player take 4? No, because n=2 <4. So, current player can only take 1, leaving opponent at n=1 (W). So, n=2 is a losing position for the current player. Wait, no\u2014wait, if the current player can force the opponent into a losing position, then n=2 is a winning position.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think again. Let's define for each n, whether it's a winning (current player can force a win) or losing (current player will lose if opponent plays optimally) position.\n\nBase case: n=0 is a losing position because the player who just moved won.\n\nn=1: current player takes 1, wins. So W.\n\nn=2: current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is a W position. So opponent can win. Alternatively, current player could take 1 and let opponent win. Wait, that's not good. Wait, no, the current player wants to leave the opponent in a losing position.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think recursively.\n\nIf from the current n, the current player can move to a position that's losing for the opponent, then the current n is a winning position. Otherwise, it's a losing position.\n\nSo, for n=0: losing (game over, previous player won).\n\nn=1: can take 1, leading to n=0, which is a losing position for the opponent. So n=1 is a winning position.\n\nn=2: possible moves lead to n=1 (W) or n= -2 (invalid, so only n=1 is possible). So, since all possible moves from n=2 lead to W positions for the opponent, n=2 is a losing position for the current player.\n\nWait, so n=2 is losing.\n\nn=3: possible moves are to n=2 (L) or n=-1 (invalid). So, by moving to n=2 (which is L for opponent), current player can force opponent into losing position. So n=3 is a winning position.\n\nn=4: possible moves are to n=3 (W) or n=0 (L). So, current player can take 4 tokens, leaving opponent with n=0, which is a losing position. So n=4 is a winning position.\n\nn=5: possible moves to n=4 (W) or n=1 (W). Both are winning positions for opponent. So, n=5 is a losing position.\n\nWait, let's summarize:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n\nResult: L W L W W L ? ? ? ? ? ...\n\nWait, let me compute n=6.\n\nn=6: possible moves are to n=5 (L) or n=2 (L). Wait, n=6-4=2, which is L. So current player can move to n=5 or n=2, both L positions. Wait, that means current player can force opponent into a losing position, so n=6 is W.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my previous conclusion. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, n=5 is L. So, from n=6, the current player can take 1, leaving n=5 (L) for the opponent. So, yes, n=6 is a winning position.\n\nWait, but wait: n=6, taking 1 leaves n=5 (L), so opponent is in losing position. So n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: possible moves are to n=6 (W) or n=3 (W). Both are W positions for opponent. So n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: possible moves to n=7 (L) or n=4 (W). So, current player can take 1, leaving opponent at n=7 (L). So n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: possible moves to n=8 (W) or n=5 (L). So current player can take 4, leaving opponent at n=5 (L). So n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: possible moves to n=9 (W) or n=6 (W). Both are W for opponent. So n=10 is L.\n\nWait, so the pattern so far is:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nResult: L W L W W L W L W W L\n\nHmm, looking for a pattern.

So the losing positions are n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,... and so on.\n\nSo the losing positions are numbers that are either 2 mod 5 or 0 mod 5? Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, the losing positions are 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,...

So n \u22610 or 2 mod5 are losing positions.\n\nBut wait, let's confirm with n=14.\n\nn=14: possible moves to n=13 (W) or n=10 (L). So current player can take 4, leaving n=10 (L), so n=14 is W.\n\nn=15: possible moves to n=14 (W) or n=11 (W). Both W for opponent, so n=15 is L. Which is 15 mod5=0, yes.\n\nn=16: possible moves to n=15 (L) or n=12 (L). So current player can take 1, leaving n=15 (L). So n=16 is W.\n\nn=17: possible moves to n=16 (W) or n=13 (W). So n=17 is L.\n\nYes, the pattern continues. So, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, for n \u22650, if n mod5 is 0 or 2, then it's a losing position.\n\nWait, but let's check n=1: 1 mod5=1 \u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2 \u2192 L, correct.\n\nn=3: 3 mod5=3 \u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=4:4 mod5=4 \u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=5:0 \u2192 L, correct.\n\nn=6:1 \u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=7:2 \u2192 L, correct.\n\nn=8:3 \u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=9:4 \u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=10:0 \u2192 L, correct.\n\nYes, seems consistent.\n\nSo, the losing positions are when n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the number of positive integers n \u22642024 where n is a losing position for Alice, i.e., n is a losing position.

So yes, 405 terms.\n\nSimilarly, mod5=0:5*404=2020, so 404 terms.\n\nThus, total is 404+405=809.\n\nWait, but let's check for n=2024.\n\nn=2024: 2024 mod5=2024-5*404=2024-2020=4. So 2024\u22614 mod5, which is a winning position.\n\nSo, yes, the last term for mod5=2 is 2022, which is within 2024.\n\nHence, the total number of losing positions is 809.\n\nBut wait, let me think again: 404 numbers for mod5=0, 405 for mod5=2. 404+405=809.\n\nIs that the correct count?\n\nAlternatively, let's think about how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nEach block of 5 numbers has exactly two such numbers: one \u22610 and one \u22612.\n\nTotal blocks: 2024//5=404 blocks, each contributing 2 numbers.
