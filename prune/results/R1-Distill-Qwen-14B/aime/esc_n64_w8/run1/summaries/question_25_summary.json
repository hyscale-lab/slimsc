      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the problem involves sets and maybe some Venn diagram thinking. I remember something about inclusion-exclusion principles from my math classes. Let me see if I can apply that here.\n\nAlright, the problem states that there are 900 residents. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's a given for everyone. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 respectively. Also, some people own exactly two of these items, and some own exactly three. I need to find how many own all four, which includes the candy hearts.\n\nWait, but since everyone owns the candy hearts, does that mean all four items are being considered? So, the four items are diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. But the way the problem is phrased, the 195, 367, and 562 are only for the first three. The candy hearts are universal. So, when they talk about owning exactly two or three things, does that include the candy hearts or not?\n\nWait, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, when they talk about owning exactly two of \"these things,\" the \"these\" probably refers to the first three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade). Because the candy hearts are given to everyone. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think in terms of all four items.\n\nLet me rephrase the problem. There are four items: A (diamond ring), B (golf clubs), C (garden spade), and D (candy hearts). Everyone owns D. The counts are |A|=195, |B|=367, |C|=562, and |D|=900. The problem says 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. Wait, but does that mean exactly two of all four, including D? Or exactly two of A, B, C? Hmm, the wording is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, the candy hearts are given to everyone. Then, it lists the numbers for the other three items. So, when it mentions \"exactly two of these things,\" I think it's referring to exactly two of the first three (A, B, C), not including D because D is already owned by everyone. Or is it including D? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, the exact problem statement is: \"there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\" The \"these things\" probably refers to the four items, including the candy hearts. Because the candy hearts are one of the four things. But if that's the case, then the total number of residents would be the sum of those owning exactly one, two, three, or four items. Wait, but the total is 900.\n\nWait, but the problem gives counts for the numbers of people owning exactly two and exactly three of \"these things.\" So, if \"these things\" include the candy hearts, then the counts would include D. But D is owned by everyone, so no one owns exactly zero of D. But the counts for exactly two and three would include D.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me think about it again. The problem says, \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So D is universal. So, when it says \"exactly two of these things,\" the \"these\" must refer to the four items, including D. But since everyone owns D, can someone own exactly two things including D? For example, owning D and A, but not B or C. So, that's exactly two things.\n\nSimilarly, someone owning D, A, and B would have exactly three things. But wait, since D is already owned by everyone, the counts for exactly two and exactly three would include D. Hmm, but the problem says 437 own exactly two and 234 own exactly three. So, perhaps the rest own exactly four. Because 900 is the total, and the counts for exactly two, three, and four should add up to 900. But wait, what about those who own exactly one or zero? No, because everyone owns D, so the minimum is one (D). So, the possible numbers of things owned are 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nBut wait, the problem says 437 own exactly two, 234 own exactly three, and we're to find the number who own all four. So, let me denote:\n\nLet x be the number of people who own exactly four things (A, B, C, D).\n\nThen, the number of people who own exactly three things is 234. But wait, if someone owns exactly three, they must be missing one item. Since D is universal, the only way to own exactly three is to own A, B, C, but not D? But D is owned by everyone, so that's impossible. Therefore, maybe the counts for exactly three include D. So, perhaps someone owns D plus two others, making exactly three. Similarly, exactly two would be D plus one other.\n\nWait, I think that's the right approach. So, if someone owns exactly two things, it must include D plus one other. Because D is universal; you can't have someone who owns exactly two things without D because D is given to everyone. So, the only way to have exactly two is to have D and one other. Similarly, exactly three would be D and two others, and exactly four would be all four.\n\nSo, that makes sense. Therefore, the counts are:\n\n- Exactly two: 437 people own D and one other (A, B, or C).\n\n- Exactly three: 234 people own D and two others.\n\n- Exactly four: x people own all four.\n\nBut wait, what about the people who own exactly one? They would only have D, since all others are optional. So, the number of people owning exactly one is y, who only have D.\n\nSo, the total population is y (exactly one) + 437 (exactly two) + 234 (exactly three) + x (exactly four) = 900.\n\nSo, y + 437 + 234 + x = 900.\n\nBut we don't know y and x. So, we need more equations.\n\nWe also know the number of people who own each item:\n\n- |A| = 195: includes those who own A only, A and D, A and another, or all four.\n\nSimilarly for B and C.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, considering that D is universal, maybe we can model the problem using the other three sets and D.\n\nWait, let's think about the counts for A, B, C. Each of these counts includes people who own that item and possibly others, including D.\n\nBut since D is universal, the counts for A, B, C are all subsets of the entire population, which is 900.\n\nSo, let me denote:\n\na = number of people who own only A and D (exactly two).\n\nb = number of people who own A and D and one more (exactly three).\n\nc = number of people who own all four (A, B, C, D).\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n\nd = only B and D.\n\ne = B and D and one more.\n\nf = all four.\n\nAnd for C:\n\ng = only C and D.\n\nh = C and D and one more.\n\ni = all four.\n\nWait, but since all four is the same as f and i, perhaps it's better to denote the all four as x.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model the problem using the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets (A, B, C), considering that D is universal.\n\nBut wait, let me think. Since everyone has D, the counts for A, B, C are the number of people who have each, regardless of the other items.\n\nSo, the total number of people who own A is 195. This includes those who own only A and D, those who own A, D, and one other, and those who own all four.\n\nSimilarly for B and C.\n\nSo, let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- Only A and D: a\n\n- Only B and D: b\n\n- Only C and D: c\n\n- A and B and D: ab\n\n- A and C and D: ac\n\n- B and C and D: bc\n\n- All four (A, B, C, D): x\n\nThen, the number of people who own exactly two things is a + b + c + ab + ac + bc.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because a, b, c are exactly two (only A and D, etc.), and ab, ac, bc are exactly three (A, B, D; etc.), and x is exactly four.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, exactly two is 437, which includes a + b + c.\n\nExactly three is 234, which includes ab + ac + bc.\n\nExactly four is x.\n\nAnd exactly one is the number of people who own only D, which we can call y.\n\nSo, the total is:\n\ny (only D) + (a + b + c) (exactly two) + (ab + ac + bc) (exactly three) + x (exactly four) = 900.\n\nSo, y + 437 + 234 + x = 900.\n\nWhich gives y + x = 900 - 437 -234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, y + x = 229.\n\nBut we need another equation to relate y and x.\n\nNow, let's look at the counts for A, B, and C.\n\nFor A: |A| = 195.\n\nThis includes:\n\n- a (only A and D)\n\n- ab (A, B, D)\n\n- ac (A, C, D)\n\n- x (all four)\n\nSo, 195 = a + ab + ac + x.\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n|B| = 367 = b + ab + bc + x.\n\nAnd for C:\n\n|C| = 562 = c + ac + bc + x.\n\nNow, we have three equations:\n\n1. a + ab + ac + x = 195\n\n2. b + ab + bc + x = 367\n\n3. c + ac + bc + x = 562\n\nWe also have:\n\n4. a + b + c = 437 (exactly two)\n\n5. ab + ac + bc = 234 (exactly three)\n\n6. y + x = 229\n\nAnd the total is 900.\n\nSo, let me write down the equations we have.\n\nFrom equation 4: a + b + c = 437.\n\nFrom equation 5: ab + ac + bc = 234.\n\nFrom equation 6: y + x = 229.\n\nWe need to find x.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about equations 1, 2, 3.\n\nIf I add equations 1, 2, and 3, I get:\n\n(a + ab + ac + x) + (b + ab + bc + x) + (c + ac + bc + x) = 195 + 367 + 562\n\nSimplify left side:\n\na + b + c + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc + 3x = 1124.\n\nBecause each ab, ac, bc appears twice, and x appears three times.\n\nNow, from equation 4: a + b + c = 437.\n\nFrom equation 5: ab + ac + bc = 234.\n\nSo, substitute these into the left side:\n\n437 + 2*(234) + 3x = 1124.\n\nCalculate:\n\n437 + 468 + 3x = 1124.\n\n437 + 468 is 905.\n\nSo, 905 + 3x = 1124.\n\nSubtract 905 from both sides: 3x = 219.\n\nSo, x = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nSo, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.\n\nWait, that seems to make sense. Let me just verify the steps.\n\nWe added the three individual equations (A, B, C) and got a sum that included a + b + c, twice ab + ac + bc, and thrice x. Then we substituted the known values from the problem (exactly two and exactly three). That gave us an equation in terms of knowns and x, which we solved.\n\nSo, the answer is 73.\n",

Let me just verify the steps.\n\nWe added the three individual equations (A, B, C) and got a sum that included a + b + c, twice ab + ac + bc, and thrice x. Then we substituted the known values from the problem (exactly two and exactly three). That gave us an equation in terms of knowns and x, which we solved.\n\nSo, the answer is 73.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets. Let's denote:\n\n- \\( a \\): Residents who own exactly two items (diamond ring and candy hearts).\n- \\( b \\): Residents who own exactly two items (golf clubs and candy hearts).\n- \\( c \\): Residents who own exactly two items (garden spade and candy hearts).\n- \\( ab \\): Residents who own exactly three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, and candy hearts).\n- \\( ac \\): Residents who own exactly three items (diamond ring, garden spade, and candy hearts).\n- \\( bc \\): Residents who own exactly three items (golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts).\n- \\( x \\): Residents who own all four items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts).\n- \\( y \\): Residents who own only candy hearts.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n- Total residents: \\( 900 \\)\n- Residents owning exactly two items: \\( a + b + c = 437 \\)\n- Residents owning exactly three items: \\( ab + ac + bc = 234 \\)\n- Residents owning all four items: \\( x \\)\n- Residents owning only candy hearts: \\( y \\)\n\nThe total number of residents can be expressed as:\n\\[\ny + (a + b + c) + (ab + ac + bc) + x = 900\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\ny + 437 + 234 + x = 900 \\implies y + x = 229\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the counts for each item:\n- \\( |A| = 195 \\): Includes \\( a + ab + ac + x \\)\n- \\( |B| = 367 \\): Includes \\( b + ab + bc + x \\)\n- \\( |C| = 562 \\): Includes \\( c + ac + bc + x \\)\n\nAdding these equations:\n\\[\n(a + ab + ac + x) + (b + ab + bc + x) + (c + ac + bc + x) = 195 + 367 + 562\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\na + b + c + 2(ab + ac + bc) + 3x = 1124\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( a + b + c = 437 \\) and \\( ab + ac + bc = 234 \\):\n\\[\n437 + 2(234) + 3x = 1124 \\implies 905 + 3x = 1124\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\n3x = 219 \\implies x = 73\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four items is \\( \\boxed{73} \\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says there are 900 residents total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which I guess is like a given for everyone. Then, some own other things: diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades. \n\nLet me jot down the numbers:\n\n- Total residents: 900\n- Own a diamond ring: 195\n- Own a set of golf clubs: 367\n- Own a garden spade: 562\n- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's 900.\n\nNow, the problem also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. I need to find how many own all four. \n\nWait, but all four would include the candy hearts, right? Because the candy hearts are owned by everyone. So, when they talk about owning all four, that's all four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts.\n\nI think I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. Let me recall how that works. The inclusion-exclusion principle helps calculate the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible intersections, adding back in the sizes of the intersections of triples, and so on.\n\nBut wait, the problem isn't directly giving me the overlaps. Instead, it gives me the number of people who own exactly two or exactly three things. Hmm, so maybe I can relate that to the inclusion-exclusion formula.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- D: set of people who own a diamond ring\n- G: set of people who own golf clubs\n- S: set of people who own a garden spade\n- C: set of people who own candy hearts (which is everyone, so C = 900)\n\nBut wait, since everyone owns a candy heart, any intersection involving C is just the other set. So, for example, D \u2229 C is just D, because everyone who owns a diamond ring also owns candy hearts. Similarly, G \u2229 C is G, and S \u2229 C is S.\n\nWait, so the union of D, G, S, and C would be C, since C is the universal set here. So maybe the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets can be applied, but since C is everyone, it's a bit different.\n\nLet me think again. The total number of residents is 900, and each owns at least the candy hearts. So, when considering other ownerships, we can think of it as how many own exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, or all four of the other items (D, G, S) along with C.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, when they say someone owns exactly two things, do they include the candy hearts? Because the candy hearts are always owned. So if someone owns exactly two things, it must be the candy hearts plus one other item. Similarly, someone who owns exactly three things would have candy hearts plus two other items, and someone who owns all four would have all three items plus candy hearts.\n\nBut the problem says, \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, the other items are optional. Therefore, when the problem states that 437 own exactly two things, that includes the candy hearts. So, for example, a person who owns a candy heart and a diamond ring is counted in the exactly two group. Similarly, a person who owns all four would be in the exactly four group, but the problem is asking for that number.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't mention the number of people who own exactly one or exactly four. So maybe I need to compute that.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n- 195 own a diamond ring\n- 367 own golf clubs\n- 562 own garden spades\n- 437 own exactly two things\n- 234 own exactly three things\n\nAnd I need to find the number who own all four.\n\nLet me think about the variables. Let me denote:\n\n- a: number of people who own exactly one item (excluding C? No, wait. Since C is always owned, \"exactly one\" would mean exactly one other item besides C. So a person who owns only C would have zero other items, but the problem doesn't mention anyone owning only C. Wait, actually, the problem states that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, but maybe they can own other items or not. So, someone could own only C, or C plus one, two, three, or all four.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the four things are C, D, G, S. So, \"owning exactly two things\" would mean owning C and one other, right? Because if you own two things, and you have to have C, then you have exactly one other. Wait, no, that would be exactly two. Wait, if you have C plus two others, that's exactly three things. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me clarify: when the problem says \"exactly two of these things,\" does it include the candy hearts or not? The problem says, \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So the four things are: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So when it says \"exactly two of these things,\" that includes the candy hearts. So, someone who owns exactly two things could be C and D, for example, but not G or S. Or any combination of two, including C.\n\nSimilarly, someone who owns exactly three things would have C plus two others, and someone who owns all four would have all three plus C.\n\nWait, but if C is included in all, then the counts for exactly two, exactly three, and all four include C.\n\nSo, let's define:\n\n- Let\u2019s denote the number of people who own exactly two of the four things as exactly two. So, that includes C plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would be C plus two others, and exactly four would be all four, which includes C plus the other three.\n\nWait, but the problem says there are 437 residents who own exactly two, and 234 who own exactly three. So, we have:\n\nTotal residents = number with exactly 1 + exactly 2 + exactly 3 + exactly 4.\n\nBut wait, wait. Each resident must own at least the candy hearts, so the possible cases are:\n\n- Only C: owns exactly 1 thing (only C)\n- C and D: exactly 2\n- C and G: exactly 2\n- C and S: exactly 2\n- C, D, G: exactly 3\n- C, D, S: exactly 3\n- C, G, S: exactly 3\n- C, D, G, S: exactly 4\n\nBut the problem states that 437 own exactly two, 234 own exactly three, and we need to find exactly four.\n\nBut the problem doesn't mention the number of people who own exactly one thing (i.e., only C). So perhaps that's part of the calculation.\n\nWait, let's think about the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets. But since C is the universal set, maybe it's better to model the other three items as subsets of C.\n\nWait, but the problem includes C as one of the four things, so perhaps the standard inclusion-exclusion applies, considering all four.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the problem without considering C, since C is a given for everyone. Let me try that approach.\n\nWait, no, because the problem counts the four things, including C, so I think I need to include it.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this with variables. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define the following:\n\n- a: number of people who own exactly one thing (which would be C plus one other)\n- b: exactly two things (C plus two others)\n- c: exactly three things (C plus three others)\n- d: exactly four things (all four, including C)\n\nWait, but the problem gives us that 437 own exactly two things, so that would be b = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number who own exactly three things is 234, so c = 234.\n\nWe need to find d, the number who own all four.\n\nNow, the total number of residents is 900, so:\n\na + b + c + d = 900.\n\nBut I don't know a, so maybe I can find another equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets, but given that each resident owns C, which is the universal set, perhaps that complicates things.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider the counts for each of the other three items (D, G, S) and relate them to the numbers a, b, c, d.\n\nThe number of people who own D is 195. This includes all the people who own D plus any combination of the other items. So, the count for D is:\n\nD = a_D + b_D + c_D + d\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many people own each item, considering overlaps.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each of the three items (D, G, S) is owned by a certain number of people, and these numbers include all the people who own those items, regardless of what else they might own.\n\nSo, for D: 195 people own it. These include:\n\n- People who own only D and C (i.e., exactly two things)\n- People who own D, C, and one other item (exactly three things)\n- People who own all four (exactly four things)\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nSo, the count for D is:\n\nNumber owning D = (number with exactly D and C) + (number with D, C, and one other) + (number with all four)\n\nBut in our variables, the number with exactly two things (b) includes C plus one other. So, for D, the number of people who own exactly D and C is part of b.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people who own D, C, and one other (i.e., exactly three things) is part of c.\n\nAnd the number who own all four is d.\n\nSo, the count for D would be:\n\n195 = (number of people with D and C only) + (number with D, C, and one other) + (number with D, C, and all others)\n\nHmm, but perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I can express each of the counts (D, G, S) in terms of a, b, c, d.\n\nWait, let's denote:\n\n- Let\u2019s define the variables:\n\na1: people who own exactly D and C (so exactly two things)\na2: people who own exactly G and C\na3: people who own exactly S and C\n\nSimilarly, the number of people who own exactly three things would include:\n\nb1: people who own D, G, and C (exactly three)\nb2: D, S, and C\nb3: G, S, and C\n\nAnd d is the number who own all four.\n\nNow, the total number of people who own exactly two things is a1 + a2 + a3 = 437.\n\nThe total number of people who own exactly three things is b1 + b2 + b3 = 234.\n\nAnd the total number of people who own all four is d.\n\nPlus, the number of people who own exactly one thing (only C) would be a0.\n\nSo, the total population is:\n\na0 + (a1 + a2 + a3) + (b1 + b2 + b3) + d = 900.\n\nSo,\n\na0 + 437 + 234 + d = 900.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\na0 + d = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, a0 + d = 229.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps yet.\n\nNow, let's look at the counts for each of the three items (D, G, S).\n\nFor D: 195 people own it. This includes:\n\n- a1 (D and C only)\n- a1 + a2 + a3 (Wait, no. Wait, D is owned by:\n\na1 (exactly D and C)\nplus b1 (D, G, C)\nplus b2 (D, S, C)\nplus d (all four).\n\nSo, 195 = a1 + b1 + b2 + d.\n\nSimilarly, for G: 367 people own it, so:\n\n367 = a2 + b1 + b3 + d.\n\nFor S: 562 people own it, so:\n\n562 = a3 + b2 + b3 + d.\n\nNow, we have three equations:\n\n1) 195 = a1 + b1 + b2 + d.\n\n2) 367 = a2 + b1 + b3 + d.\n\n3) 562 = a3 + b2 + b3 + d.\n\nWe also have:\n\na1 + a2 + a3 = 437 (from exactly two things).\n\nb1 + b2 + b3 = 234 (from exactly three things).\n\nAnd a0 + d = 229.\n\nWe have 5 equations and 7 variables (a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, d, a0). Wait, but a0 is another variable. Hmm, that's a lot. Maybe I can find a way to express some variables in terms of others.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can add the three equations for D, G, S.\n\nAdding equations 1, 2, and 3:\n\n195 + 367 + 562 = (a1 + a2 + a3) + (b1 + b2 + b3) + 3d.\n\nSo, 195 + 367 = 562; wait, 195 + 367 is 562? Let me compute:\n\n195 + 367: 195 + 300 is 495, plus 67 is 562. So 562 + 562 = 1124?\n\nWait, no. Wait, 195 + 367 + 562 = ?\n\nLet me calculate:\n\n195 + 367 = 562.\n\n562 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSo, 1124 = (a1 + a2 + a3) + (b1 + b2 + b3) + 3d.\n\nWe know that a1 + a2 + a3 = 437, and b1 + b2 + b3 = 234.\n\nSo,\n\n1124 = 437 + 234 + 3d.\n\n437 + 234 = 671.\n\nSo,\n\n1124 = 671 + 3d.\n\nSubtract 671 from both sides:\n\n1124 - 671 = 3d.\n\nCompute 1124 - 671:\n\n671 + 453 = 1124? Let me see:\n\n671 + 400 = 1071.\n\n1071 + 53 = 1124.\n\nSo, 453 = 3d.\n\nThus, d = 453 / 3 = 151.\n\nSo, d = 151.\n\nWait, that's the number of people who own all four things, including C. So, the answer is 151.\n\nBut let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124. Correct.\n\nThen, a1 + a2 + a3 is 437, and b1 + b2 + b3 is 234. So 437 + 234 is 671. 1124 - 671 is 453. 453 divided by 3 is 151. So yes, d is 151.\n\nSo, the number of residents who own all four things is 151.\n",

I need to find how many own all four. \n\nWait, but all four would include the candy hearts, right? Because the candy hearts are owned by everyone. So, when they talk about owning all four, that's all four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts.\n\nI think I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. Let me recall how that works.

So, for example, D \u2229 C is just D, because everyone who owns a diamond ring also owns candy hearts.

So maybe the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets can be applied, but since C is everyone, it's a bit different.\n\nLet me think again. The total number of residents is 900, and each owns at least the candy hearts.

These include:\n\n- People who own only D and C (i.e., exactly two things)\n- People who own D, C, and one other item (exactly three things)\n- People who own all four (exactly four things)\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nSo, the count for D is:\n\nNumber owning D = (number with exactly D and C) + (number with D, C, and one other) + (number with all four)\n\nBut in our variables, the number with exactly two things (b) includes C plus one other. So, for D, the number of people who own exactly D and C is part of b.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people who own D, C, and one other (i.e., exactly three things) is part of c.\n\nAnd the number who own all four is d.\n\nSo, the count for D would be:\n\n195 = (number of people with D and C only) + (number with D, C, and one other) + (number with D, C, and all others)\n\nHmm, but perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I can express each of the counts (D, G, S) in terms of a, b, c, d.\n\nWait, let's denote:\n\n- Let\u2019s define the variables:\n\na1: people who own exactly D and C (so exactly two things)\na2: people who own exactly G and C\na3: people who own exactly S and C\n\nSimilarly, the number of people who own exactly three things would include:\n\nb1: people who own D, G, and C (exactly three)\nb2: D, S, and C\nb3: G, S, and C\n\nAnd d is the number who own all four.\n\nNow, the total number of people who own exactly two things is a1 + a2 + a3 = 437.\n\nThe total number of people who own exactly three things is b1 + b2 + b3 = 234.\n\nAnd the total number of people who own all four is d.\n\nPlus, the number of people who own exactly one thing (only C) would be a0.\n\nSo, the total population is:\n\na0 + (a1 + a2 + a3) + (b1 + b2 + b3) + d = 900.\n\nSo,\n\na0 + 437 + 234 + d = 900.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\na0 + d = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, a0 + d = 229.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps yet.\n\nNow, let's look at the counts for each of the three items (D, G, S).\n\nFor D: 195 people own it. This includes:\n\n- a1 (D and C only)\n- a1 + a2 + a3 (Wait, no. Wait, D is owned by:\n\na1 (exactly D and C)\nplus b1 (D, G, C)\nplus b2 (D, S, C)\nplus d (all four).\n\nSo, 195 = a1 + b1 + b2 + d.\n\nSimilarly, for G: 367 people own it, so:\n\n367 = a2 + b1 + b3 + d.\n\nFor S: 562 people own it, so:\n\n562 = a3 + b2 + b3 + d.\n\nNow, we have three equations:\n\n1) 195 = a1 + b1 + b2 + d.\n\n2) 367 = a2 + b1 + b3 + d.\n\n3) 562 = a3 + b2 + b3 + d.\n\nWe also have:\n\na1 + a2 + a3 = 437 (from exactly two things).\n\nb1 + b2 + b3 = 234 (from exactly three things).\n\nAnd a0 + d = 229.\n\nWe have 5 equations and 7 variables (a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, d, a0). Wait, but a0 is another variable. Hmm, that's a lot. Maybe I can find a way to express some variables in terms of others.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can add the three equations for D, G, S.\n\nAdding equations 1, 2, and 3:\n\n195 + 367 + 562 = (a1 + a2 + a3) + (b1 + b2 + b3) + 3d.\n\nSo, 195 + 367 = 562; wait, 195 + 367 is 562? Let me compute:\n\n195 + 367: 195 + 300 is 495, plus 67 is 562. So 562 + 562 = 1124?\n\nWait, no. Wait, 195 + 367 + 562 = ?\n\nLet me calculate:\n\n195 + 367 = 562.\n\n562 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSo, 1124 = (a1 + a2 + a3) + (b1 + b2 + b3) + 3d.\n\nWe know that a1 + a2 + a3 = 437, and b1 + b2 + b3 = 234.\n\nSo,\n\n1124 = 437 + 234 + 3d.\n\n437 + 234 = 671.\n\nSo,\n\n1124 = 671 + 3d.\n\nSubtract 671 from both sides:\n\n1124 - 671 = 3d.\n\nCompute 1124 - 671:\n\n671 + 453 = 1124? Let me see:\n\n671 + 400 = 1071.\n\n1071 + 53 = 1124.\n\nSo, 453 = 3d.\n\nThus, d = 453 / 3 = 151.\n\nSo, d = 151.\n\nWait, that's the number of people who own all four things, including C. So, the answer is 151.\n\nBut let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124. Correct.\n\nThen, a1 + a2 + a3 is 437, and b1 + b2 + b3 is 234. So 437 + 234 is 671. 1124 - 671 is 453. 453 divided by 3 is 151. So yes, d is 151.\n\nSo, the number of residents who own all four things is 151.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of residents in Aimeville who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. \n\nWe are given:\n- Total residents: 900\n- Residents owning a diamond ring (D): 195\n- Residents owning golf clubs (G): 367\n- Residents owning a garden spade (S): 562\n- Residents owning exactly two items: 437\n- Residents owning exactly three items: 234\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we set up the following equations:\n\n1. **Total ownership counts for each item**:\n   - For D: \\( 195 = a_1 + b_1 + b_2 + d \\)\n   - For G: \\( 367 = a_2 + b_1 + b_3 + d \\)\n   - For S: \\( 562 = a_3 + b_2 + b_3 + d \\)\n\n2. **Total residents owning exactly two items**:\n   - \\( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 437 \\)\n\n3. **Total residents owning exactly three items**:\n   - \\( b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = 234 \\)\n\n4. **Total residents**:\n   - \\( a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + d = 900 \\)\n   - Simplifying, \\( a_0 + d = 229 \\)\n\nBy adding the three ownership equations:\n\\[ 195 + 367 + 562 = (a_1 + a_2 + a_3) + (b_1 + b_2 + b_3) + 3d \\]\n\\[ 1124 = 437 + 234 + 3d \\]\n\\[ 1124 = 671 + 3d \\]\n\\[ 3d = 453 \\]\n\\[ d = 151 \\]\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four items is **151**.\n\n\\boxed{151}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, there are 900 residents in Aimeville, and each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. Additionally, some own a diamond ring, some own a set of golf clubs, some own a garden spade. \n\nThe numbers given are: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade. Also, 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We need to find how many own all four\u2014so that's the candy hearts plus the other three.\n\nHmm, this seems like a problem that involves sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that for multiple sets, the inclusion-exclusion principle can get complicated, but perhaps I can model it with a Venn diagram approach.\n\nLet me denote the sets as follows:\n- Let D be the set of residents who own a diamond ring.\n- Let G be those who own golf clubs.\n- Let S be those who own a garden spade.\n- Let C be those who own candy hearts. But wait, the problem says every resident owns a candy heart, so C is actually the universal set with 900 elements.\n\nBut since every resident owns a candy heart, the problem is about how many own other items in addition to the candy hearts. So, effectively, we can think of the problem as: How many residents own all three items (diamond, golf, spade) in addition to the candy heart. Because owning all four is the same as owning all three plus the candy heart, which everyone already has.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the candy heart is something everyone has. So, when they talk about owning exactly two things, it's the two other items plus the candy heart. Similarly, exactly three would mean the three other items plus the candy heart. And exactly four would be all four, including the candy heart.\n\nBut since the candy heart is universal, maybe we can model the problem by considering the other three items. Let me try to rephrase the problem in terms of just D, G, and S, since everyone already has C.\n\nSo, the total number of residents is 900. The number of residents owning exactly two of D, G, S is 437, and exactly three is 234.\n\nWait, but actually, since C is universal, when considering ownership of exactly two items, it's two of D, G, S plus C. So, the counts given (437 and 234) include C as one of the items. But since C is always there, perhaps the problem is about the other three items.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me consider that each resident owns C, and then may own 0, 1, 2, 3, or all four of the items (C plus D, G, S). But since C is always owned, the ownership of the other three items can be considered as subsets.\n\nBut the problem states that 437 own exactly two of the four things, and 234 own exactly three. Wait, no. Let me read it again.\n\n\"437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\"\n\nSo, these are counts of residents owning exactly two or exactly three of all four items (including C). But since C is owned by everyone, the \"exactly two\" must include C and exactly one of the other three. Similarly, \"exactly three\" would include C and exactly two of the other three.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Because if you have exactly two of the four things, and C is one of them, then you have one other item. Similarly, exactly three would mean you have two other items in addition to C.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem by considering the other three items (D, G, S) and the counts of how many people own 1, 2, 3, or all four. But since C is always present, the number of people owning exactly k of the four is equal to the number of people owning exactly (k-1) of D, G, S.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should approach it using inclusion-exclusion for the three sets D, G, S, and then relate it to the total.\n\nLet me denote:\n- |D| = 195\n- |G| = 367\n- |S| = 562\n- Total residents, n = 900\n\nBut since every resident owns C, we can ignore C for the inclusion-exclusion part, because it's already included in everyone. Wait, no. Because the problem is about ownership of the four items, but since C is universal, the problem is about the other three.\n\nWait, perhaps the standard inclusion-exclusion formula applies to the three sets D, G, S. The total number of residents owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to |D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nBut we don't know |D \u222a G \u222a S| because some people might not own any of D, G, S. Wait, but since every resident owns C, but they could own just C. So, the number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to (total residents) minus those who own only C.\n\nBut we don't know how many own only C. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nWait, let's think about all possible ownership counts. Each resident can own 1, 2, 3, or 4 items, but since C is always owned, the number of items they own is 1 (only C), 2 (C plus one other), 3 (C plus two others), or 4 (all four).\n\nBut the problem states that 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. Wait, does that mean exactly two including C? Or exactly two of D, G, S?\n\nWait, the problem says, \"437 residents who own exactly two of these things\", and \"234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\" The \"these things\" refers to all four items, including C.\n\nSo, a resident who owns exactly two things must have exactly two of the four, which includes C. So, they have C and exactly one other. Similarly, those with exactly three things have C and exactly two others.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the four \"things\" are C, D, G, S. So, a resident can own any combination of these, but C is always present.\n\nSo, the counts are:\n- Exactly two things: 437. These are people who own C and exactly one of D, G, or S.\n- Exactly three things: 234. These own C and exactly two of D, G, S.\n- Exactly four things: the number we're trying to find, which is C plus D, G, S.\n- Exactly one thing: which would be only C. But the problem doesn't mention this count.\n\nBut the problem doesn't tell us how many own exactly one thing, but since the total is 900, perhaps we can find it.\n\nLet me denote the number of people who own exactly four things as x. That is, they own C, D, G, S.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the counts for exactly two and exactly three are given. So, let me structure this:\n\nLet me define:\n- a = number of people owning exactly C (only C)\n- b = number owning exactly C and D (C and D only)\n- c = number owning exactly C and G (C and G only)\n- d = number owning exactly C and S (C and S only)\n- e = number owning exactly C, D, G (all three except S)\n- f = number owning exactly C, D, S (all three except G)\n- g = number owning exactly C, G, S (all three except D)\n- h = number owning all four (C, D, G, S)\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated, but maybe manageable.\n\nWe know that:\na + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900.\n\nAlso, the number of people owning exactly two things is 437. These are the people who own exactly two of the four, which are:\n\n- b (C and D)\n- c (C and G)\n- d (C and S)\n\nSo, b + c + d = 437.\n\nThe number of people owning exactly three things is 234. These are:\n\n- e (C, D, G)\n- f (C, D, S)\n- g (C, G, S)\n\nSo, e + f + g = 234.\n\nAnd the number of people owning exactly four things is h, which is what we need to find.\n\nAdditionally, the problem gives us the total number of people owning each of D, G, S:\n\n|D| = 195 = b + e + f + h\n|G| = 367 = c + e + g + h\n|S| = 562 = d + f + g + h\n\nSo, we have the following equations:\n\n1. a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900\n2. b + c + d = 437\n3. e + f + g = 234\n4. |D| = b + e + f + h = 195\n5. |G| = c + e + g + h = 367\n6. |S| = d + f + g + h = 562\n\nWe need to find h.\n\nLet me see if I can express all variables in terms of h.\n\nFrom equation 2: b + c + d = 437.\n\nFrom equation 3: e + f + g = 234.\n\nFrom equation 1: a = 900 - (b + c + d) - (e + f + g) - h = 900 - 437 - 234 - h = 900 - 671 - h = 229 - h.\n\nSo, a = 229 - h.\n\nNow, let's look at equation 4: b + e + f + h = 195.\n\nEquation 5: c + e + g + h = 367.\n\nEquation 6: d + f + g + h = 562.\n\nLet me denote equations 4,5,6 as:\n\n4. b + e + f = 195 - h\n5. c + e + g = 367 - h\n6. d + f + g = 562 - h\n\nNow, let's sum equations 4,5,6.\n\nLeft side: (b + e + f) + (c + e + g) + (d + f + g) = b + c + d + 2e + 2f + 2g + f + g.\n\nWait, wait, let me sum them correctly:\n\nEquation4: b + e + f = 195 - h\nEquation5: c + e + g = 367 - h\nEquation6: d + f + g = 562 - h\n\nSumming all three:\n\n(b + e + f) + (c + e + g) + (d + f + g) = (195 - h) + (367 - h) + (562 - h)\nLeft side: b + c + d + 2e + 2f + 2g + (f + g) ??? Wait, maybe I should count each term.\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nEach equation contributes:\n\nEquation4: b + e + f\nEquation5: c + e + g\nEquation6: d + f + g\n\nSo adding all three:\n\nb + c + d + (e + e) + (f + f) + (g + g) = (195 + 367 + 562) - 3h\n\nSo, b + c + d + 2e + 2f + 2g = 1124 - 3h.\n\nBut from equation 2, b + c + d = 437.\n\nFrom equation 3, e + f + g = 234.\n\nSo, substituting these into the summed equation:\n\n437 + 2*(234) = 1124 - 3h\n\nCalculate left side: 437 + 468 = 905.\n\nSo, 905 = 1124 - 3h.\n\nSolving for h:\n\n3h = 1124 - 905 = 219.\n\nSo, h = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nWait, that's 73. So, h is 73.\n\nLet me verify.\n\nSo, h =73.\n\nNow, from equation 4: b + e + f = 195 -73=122.\n\nEquation5: c + e + g=367-73=294.\n\nEquation6: d + f + g=562-73=489.\n\nAlso, from equation 3: e + f + g=234.\n\nLet me see if these are consistent.\n\nFrom equation4: b + e + f=122.\n\nBut e + f =122 - b.\n\nFrom equation3: e + f + g=234. So, substituting e + f =122 - b,\n\n122 - b + g=234 \u2192 g =234 - (122 - b) = 234 -122 +b =112 + b.\n\nSimilarly, from equation5: c + e + g=294.\n\nWe have e + g =294 - c.\n\nFrom equation3: e + f + g=234.\n\nSo, substituting e + g=294 -c into equation3: (294 -c) + f=234 \u2192 f=234 - (294 -c)=234-294 +c= -60 +c.\n\nFrom equation4: b + e + f=122.\n\nWe have f= -60 +c, so substituting:\n\nb + e + (-60 +c) =122 \u2192 b + e + c = 122 +60=182.\n\nBut from equation2: b + c + d=437.\n\nSo, d=437 - (b +c).\n\nFrom equation6: d + f + g=489.\n\nWe have d=437 - (b +c), f= -60 +c, and g=112 +b.\n\nSubstituting into equation6:\n\n(437 -b -c) + (-60 +c) + (112 +b) =489.\n\nSimplify:\n\n437 -b -c -60 +c +112 +b =489.\n\nLet's compute term by term:\n\n437 -60=377; 377 +112=489.\n\nAnd the variables: -b +b=0; -c +c=0.\n\nSo, 489=489.\n\nWhich is an identity, meaning our equations are consistent.\n\nSo, the solution is consistent. Therefore, h=73.\n\nSo, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.\n",

But since C is always present, the number of people owning exactly k of the four is equal to the number of people owning exactly (k-1) of D, G, S.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should approach it using inclusion-exclusion for the three sets D, G, S, and then relate it to the total.\n\nLet me denote:\n- |D| = 195\n- |G| = 367\n- |S| = 562\n- Total residents, n = 900\n\nBut since every resident owns C, we can ignore C for the inclusion-exclusion part, because it's already included in everyone. Wait, no. Because the problem is about ownership of the four items, but since C is universal, the problem is about the other three.\n\nWait, perhaps the standard inclusion-exclusion formula applies to the three sets D, G, S. The total number of residents owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to |D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nBut we don't know |D \u222a G \u222a S| because some people might not own any of D, G, S. Wait, but since every resident owns C, but they could own just C. So, the number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to (total residents) minus those who own only C.\n\nBut we don't know how many own only C. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nWait, let's think about all possible ownership counts. Each resident can own 1, 2, 3, or 4 items, but since C is always owned, the number of items they own is 1 (only C), 2 (C plus one other), 3 (C plus two others), or 4 (all four).\n\nBut the problem states that 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. Wait, does that mean exactly two including C? Or exactly two of D, G, S?\n\nWait, the problem says, \"437 residents who own exactly two of these things\", and \"234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\" The \"these things\" refers to all four items, including C.\n\nSo, a resident who owns exactly two things must have exactly two of the four, which includes C. So, they have C and exactly one other. Similarly, those with exactly three things have C and exactly two others.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the four \"things\" are C, D, G, S. So, a resident can own any combination of these, but C is always present.\n\nSo, the counts are:\n- Exactly two things: 437. These are people who own C and exactly one of D, G, or S.\n- Exactly three things: 234. These own C and exactly two of D, G, S.\n- Exactly four things: the number we're trying to find, which is C plus D, G, S.\n- Exactly one thing: which would be only C. But the problem doesn't mention this count.\n\nBut the problem doesn't tell us how many own exactly one thing, but since the total is 900, perhaps we can find it.\n\nLet me denote the number of people who own exactly four things as x. That is, they own C, D, G, S.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the counts for exactly two and exactly three are given. So, let me structure this:\n\nLet me define:\n- a = number of people owning exactly C (only C)\n- b = number owning exactly C and D (C and D only)\n- c = number owning exactly C and G (C and G only)\n- d = number owning exactly C and S (C and S only)\n- e = number owning exactly C, D, G (all three except S)\n- f = number owning exactly C, D, S (all three except G)\n- g = number owning exactly C, G, S (all three except D)\n- h = number owning all four (C, D, G, S)\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated, but maybe manageable.\n\nWe know that:\na + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900.\n\nAlso, the number of people owning exactly two things is 437. These are the people who own exactly two of the four, which are:\n\n- b (C and D)\n- c (C and G)\n- d (C and S)\n\nSo, b + c + d = 437.\n\nThe number of people owning exactly three things is 234. These are:\n\n- e (C, D, G)\n- f (C, D, S)\n- g (C, G, S)\n\nSo, e + f + g = 234.\n\nAnd the number of people owning exactly four things is h, which is what we need to find.\n\nAdditionally, the problem gives us the total number of people owning each of D, G, S:\n\n|D| = 195 = b + e + f + h\n|G| = 367 = c + e + g + h\n|S| = 562 = d + f + g + h\n\nSo, we have the following equations:\n\n1. a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900\n2. b + c + d = 437\n3. e + f + g = 234\n4. |D| = b + e + f + h = 195\n5. |G| = c + e + g + h = 367\n6. |S| = d + f + g + h = 562\n\nWe need to find h.\n\nLet me see if I can express all variables in terms of h.\n\nFrom equation 2: b + c + d = 437.\n\nFrom equation 3: e + f + g = 234.\n\nFrom equation 1: a = 900 - (b + c + d) - (e + f + g) - h = 900 - 437 - 234 - h = 900 - 671 - h = 229 - h.\n\nSo, a = 229 - h.\n\nNow, let's look at equation 4: b + e + f + h = 195.\n\nEquation 5: c + e + g + h = 367.\n\nEquation 6: d + f + g + h = 562.\n\nLet me denote equations 4,5,6 as:\n\n4. b + e + f = 195 - h\n5. c + e + g = 367 - h\n6. d + f + g = 562 - h\n\nNow, let's sum equations 4,5,6.\n\nLeft side: (b + e + f) + (c + e + g) + (d + f + g) = b + c + d + 2e + 2f + 2g + f + g.\n\nWait, wait, let me sum them correctly:\n\nEquation4: b + e + f = 195 - h\nEquation5: c + e + g = 367 - h\nEquation6: d + f + g = 562 - h\n\nSumming all three:\n\n(b + e + f) + (c + e + g) + (d + f + g) = (195 - h) + (367 - h) + (562 - h)\nLeft side: b + c + d + 2e + 2f + 2g + (f + g) ??? Wait, maybe I should count each term.\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nEach equation contributes:\n\nEquation4: b + e + f\nEquation5: c + e + g\nEquation6: d + f + g\n\nSo adding all three:\n\nb + c + d + (e + e) + (f + f) + (g + g) = (195 + 367 + 562) - 3h\n\nSo, b + c + d + 2e + 2f + 2g = 1124 - 3h.\n\nBut from equation 2, b + c + d = 437.\n\nFrom equation 3, e + f + g = 234.\n\nSo, substituting these into the summed equation:\n\n437 + 2*(234) = 1124 - 3h\n\nCalculate left side: 437 + 468 = 905.\n\nSo, 905 = 1124 - 3h.\n\nSolving for h:\n\n3h = 1124 - 905 = 219.\n\nSo, h = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nWait, that's 73. So, h is 73.\n\nLet me verify.\n\nSo, h =73.\n\nNow, from equation 4: b + e + f = 195 -73=122.\n\nEquation5: c + e + g=367-73=294.\n\nEquation6: d + f + g=562-73=489.\n\nAlso, from equation 3: e + f + g=234.\n\nLet me see if these are consistent.\n\nFrom equation4: b + e + f=122.\n\nBut e + f =122 - b.\n\nFrom equation3: e + f + g=234. So, substituting e + f =122 - b,\n\n122 - b + g=234 \u2192 g =234 - (122 - b) = 234 -122 +b =112 + b.\n\nSimilarly, from equation5: c + e + g=294.\n\nWe have e + g =294 - c.\n\nFrom equation3: e + f + g=234.\n\nSo, substituting e + g=294 -c into equation3: (294 -c) + f=234 \u2192 f=234 - (294 -c)=234-294 +c= -60 +c.\n\nFrom equation4: b + e + f=122.\n\nWe have f= -60 +c, so substituting:\n\nb + e + (-60 +c) =122 \u2192 b + e + c = 122 +60=182.\n\nBut from equation2: b + c + d=437.\n\nSo, d=437 - (b +c).\n\nFrom equation6: d + f + g=489.\n\nWe have d=437 - (b +c), f= -60 +c, and g=112 +b.\n\nSubstituting into equation6:\n\n(437 -b -c) + (-60 +c) + (112 +b) =489.\n\nSimplify:\n\n437 -b -c -60 +c +112 +b =489.\n\nLet's compute term by term:\n\n437 -60=377; 377 +112=489.\n\nAnd the variables: -b +b=0; -c +c=0.\n\nSo, 489=489.\n\nWhich is an identity, meaning our equations are consistent.\n\nSo, the solution is consistent. Therefore, h=73.\n\nSo, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the given data. Let \\( h \\) represent the number of residents who own all four items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts). We set up the following equations based on the problem's conditions:\n\n1. \\( a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900 \\)  \n2. \\( b + c + d = 437 \\) (exactly two items, including candy hearts)  \n3. \\( e + f + g = 234 \\) (exactly three items, including candy hearts)  \n4. \\( |D| = b + e + f + h = 195 \\)  \n5. \\( |G| = c + e + g + h = 367 \\)  \n6. \\( |S| = d + f + g + h = 562 \\)  \n\nBy summing equations 4, 5, and 6, we get:  \n\\[\n(b + e + f) + (c + e + g) + (d + f + g) = (195 - h) + (367 - h) + (562 - h)\n\\]  \nSimplifying the left side:  \n\\[\nb + c + d + 2e + 2f + 2g = 1124 - 3h\n\\]  \nUsing equations 2 and 3:  \n\\[\n437 + 2 \\times 234 = 1124 - 3h\n\\]  \n\\[\n905 = 1124 - 3h\n\\]  \nSolving for \\( h \\):  \n\\[\n3h = 219 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad h = 73\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four items is \\(\\boxed{73}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many residents of Aimeville own all four things: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let me list out what I know. There are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's one thing everyone has. Then, some own a diamond ring, some own golf clubs, and some own a garden spade. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 respectively.\n\nWait, so the candy hearts are universal. That might simplify things a bit because it means the total number of items isn't all over the place. Now, the problem also says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. I'm supposed to find how many own all four.\n\nI remember that in problems involving sets and their overlaps, the principle of inclusion-exclusion is really useful. Maybe I can apply that here. Let me recall the formula for four sets, but I think it's a bit complicated. Alternatively, since the candy hearts are universal, maybe I can model the problem with three sets instead of four.\n\nWait, actually, the four things are the diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. But since everyone has candy hearts, maybe it's easier to consider the other three as sets and the fourth as the universal set. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model it using the three items (diamond, golf, garden) and the fact that everyone has candy hearts. So each resident's ownership can be represented in terms of the other three items. Maybe I can ignore the candy hearts since they're universal and just focus on the other three, but I have to remember that all the ownerships are in addition to the candy hearts.\n\nWait, but the problem is about owning all four, which includes the candy hearts. Since everyone already has candy hearts, owning all four is just owning the other three plus candy hearts. But since candy hearts are already owned by everyone, it's the same as owning all three of the other items. So maybe the number of people who own all four is equal to the number of people who own all three of the other items. Hmm, that might be useful.\n\nLet me try to model this with the inclusion-exclusion principle. Let me denote:\n\n- Let A be the set of people who own a diamond ring.\n- Let B be the set of people who own golf clubs.\n- Let C be the set of people who own a garden spade.\n- Let D be the set of people who own candy hearts. Since everyone owns D, D is the universal set, so |D|=900.\n\nBut since D is universal, any intersection involving D is just the other set. So when considering A \u2229 D, it's just A. So maybe it's easier to think of the problem in terms of the three sets A, B, C, with the universal set being D.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the four items, but since D is universal, maybe the problem reduces to three sets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets, but considering that all are subsets of D, which is size 900.\n\nWait, perhaps the standard inclusion-exclusion formula applies to the three sets A, B, C. Let me think.\n\nThe formula for three sets is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nBut in this case, the total number of people is 900, but how many of them own at least one of A, B, or C? Wait, but the problem says that each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So the only thing that varies is whether they own the other three. So, the total number of people is 900, and each person owns D (candy hearts) plus some combination of A, B, C.\n\nBut the problem mentions that 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, perhaps we can model this using the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nWait, but the problem is about all four, so perhaps I can think in terms of the Venn diagram for three sets A, B, C, and then account for those who have exactly two or three of them.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- a: number of people who own exactly A only.\n- b: exactly B only.\n- c: exactly C only.\n- ab: exactly A and B only.\n- ac: exactly A and C only.\n- bc: exactly B and C only.\n- abc: exactly A, B, and C.\n\nSo, the total number of people who own exactly two is ab + ac + bc = 437.\n\nThe total number of people who own exactly three is abc = 234.\n\nNow, the total number of people is 900, but since everyone owns D, which is candy hearts, each person's ownership is D plus some combination of A, B, C.\n\nBut wait, actually, each person owns D plus some subset of A, B, C. So the counts for exactly two or three include D as well. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as the number of people who own exactly two of the four items. But wait, since D is always owned, owning exactly two of the four would mean owning D plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would mean D plus two others, and exactly four would mean D plus all three.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the 437 who own exactly two of the four items would be those who own D plus exactly one of A, B, or C. Similarly, the 234 who own exactly three of the four items would be those who own D plus exactly two of A, B, C. And the ones who own all four would be those who own D plus all three, which is the same as owning all four, which is the same as the number of people who own A, B, and C.\n\nWait, so if I can find the number of people who own all three of A, B, and C, that would be the number who own all four items, since D is universal.\n\nSo, maybe I can model this as follows:\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- n(A) = 195\n- n(B) = 367\n- n(C) = 562\n\nWe need to find n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C), which would be the number of people who own all four items, since D is universal.\n\nBut to find n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C), I can use inclusion-exclusion for three sets.\n\nWait, but I also have information about exactly two and exactly three. So perhaps I can model the total number of people as the sum of all possible ownership categories.\n\nWait, each person can be in one of the following categories:\n\n- Owns exactly one of A, B, C (along with D)\n- Owns exactly two of A, B, C (along with D)\n- Owns exactly three of A, B, C (along with D)\n\nSince D is universal, the total number of people is the sum of these categories.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- a = number of people who own exactly A and D (so only A and D)\n- b = exactly B and D\n- c = exactly C and D\n- ab = exactly A, B, and D (so exactly two of A, B, C plus D)\n- ac = exactly A, C, and D\n- bc = exactly B, C, and D\n- abc = exactly A, B, C, and D (so all four)\n\nSo the total number of people is:\n\na + b + c + ab + ac + bc + abc = 900\n\nNow, the number of people who own exactly two of the four things is ab + ac + bc = 437.\n\nThe number of people who own exactly three of the four things is abc = 234.\n\nWait, but the problem states that 437 own exactly two of the four, and 234 own exactly three. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the total number of people is 900, so substituting:\n\na + b + c + (ab + ac + bc) + abc = 900\n\nWe know that ab + ac + bc = 437, and abc = 234. So:\n\na + b + c + 437 + 234 = 900\n\nWhich simplifies to a + b + c = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, a + b + c = 229.\n\nNow, I can also express the total number of people owning A, B, or C as:\n\nn(A) + n(B) + n(C) = (a + ab + ac + abc) + (b + ab + bc + abc) + (c + ac + bc + abc)\n\nWait, no, more accurately:\n\nn(A) = a + ab + ac + abc\n\nSimilarly, n(B) = b + ab + bc + abc\n\nn(C) = c + ac + bc + abc\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\nn(A) + n(B) + n(C) = (a + b + c) + 2(ab + ac + bc) + 3(abc)\n\nWe know n(A) = 195, n(B)=367, n(C)=562.\n\nSo, sum is 195 + 367 + 562 = let's compute that.\n\n195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSo, 1124 = (a + b + c) + 2*(437) + 3*(234)\n\nWe know a + b + c = 229, so plug that in:\n\n1124 = 229 + 2*437 + 3*234\n\nLet me compute 2*437: 874\n\n3*234: 702\n\nSo, 229 + 874 = 1103; 1103 + 702 = 1805\n\nWait, but that's 1124 on the left, but 1805 on the right. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nHmm, maybe I got the inclusion-exclusion formula wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the standard inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets, which is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nBut in this case, |A \u222a B \u222a C| is the number of people who own at least one of A, B, or C. But since everyone owns D, and D is separate, but A, B, C are subsets of D.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the residents can own any combination of A, B, C, along with D. So, the total number of people is the number of people who own at least one of A, B, C plus those who don't own any of A, B, C.\n\nWait, but since everyone owns D, but they might not own any of A, B, C. So, the total is 900 = (number of people who own at least one of A, B, C) + (number who own only D).\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't mention the number of people who own only D. So perhaps that's part of the equation.\n\nWait, let me try to model it again.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- x = number of people who own only D (no A, B, C)\n- y = number who own exactly one of A, B, C along with D\n- z = number who own exactly two of A, B, C along with D\n- w = number who own all three A, B, C along with D\n\nSo, total people = x + y + z + w = 900.\n\nWe know that z = 437 (exactly two of A, B, C plus D), and w = 234 (exactly three of A, B, C plus D).\n\nSo, x + y + 437 + 234 = 900 \u2192 x + y = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nNow, the total number of people owning A is 195. Let's express this in terms of y and z and w.\n\nn(A) = (number owning only A) + (number owning A and B only) + (number owning A and C only) + (number owning A, B, C).\n\nSimilarly for n(B) and n(C).\n\nSo, n(A) = a + ab + ac + abc, where a is only A, ab is A and B, ac is A and C, and abc is all three.\n\nSimilarly, n(B) = b + ab + bc + abc\n\nn(C) = c + ac + bc + abc\n\nBut in our variables:\n\ny is the sum of a + b + c.\n\nz is the sum of ab + ac + bc.\n\nw is abc.\n\nSo, n(A) = a + (ab + ac) + abc = a + (ab + ac) + w.\n\nBut ab + ac is part of z, which is 437. So, ab + ac = (z - bc).\n\nWait, this might not be the easiest way.\n\nAlternatively, let me express n(A) as:\n\nn(A) = a + ab + ac + abc = (a) + (ab + ac) + abc.\n\nSimilarly, n(B) = b + ab + bc + abc, and n(C) = c + ac + bc + abc.\n\nSo, if I add n(A) + n(B) + n(C):\n\nn(A) + n(B) + n(C) = (a + b + c) + 2(ab + ac + bc) + 3(abc)\n\nWe know that a + b + c = y, ab + ac + bc = z, and abc = w.\n\nSo,\n\nn(A) + n(B) + n(C) = y + 2z + 3w\n\nWe have n(A) + n(B) + n(C) = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.\n\nAnd y + 2z + 3w = 1124.\n\nWe know that z = 437, w = 234, and x + y = 229.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\ny + 2*437 + 3*234 = 1124\n\nCompute 2*437 = 874\n\n3*234 = 702\n\nSo, 874 + 702 = 1576\n\nSo, y + 1576 = 1124 \u2192 y = 1124 - 1576 = -452\n\nWait, that can't be right. y is the number of people who own exactly one of A, B, C, which can't be negative. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nHmm, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect. Maybe I need to model it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets, considering that each resident has D, which is universal. Let me think.\n\nThe total number of residents is 900. The number of people who own at least one of A, B, or C is equal to the sum of the individual sets minus the pairwise intersections plus the triple intersection.\n\nBut in this case, since D is universal, the number of people who don't own A, B, or C is x, which is 900 - (number owning at least one of A, B, C).\n\nBut maybe that's not directly helpful. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the problem without considering D, since D is universal. Let me think of the problem as three sets A, B, C, each being a subset of the universal set of 900 residents. Then, the number of people who own exactly two of A, B, C is 437, and exactly three is 234.\n\nBut wait, no, because in the problem, the 437 own exactly two of the four things, which includes D. So, exactly two would be owning D plus one of A, B, C. Similarly, exactly three would be D plus two of A, B, C. And exactly four would be D plus all three.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a better way to model it.\n\nSo, the number of people who own exactly two of the four items is the number of people who own D and exactly one of A, B, C. Similarly, exactly three would be D plus exactly two of A, B, C. And exactly four is D plus all three of A, B, C.\n\nSo, the total number of people who own exactly one item (only D) would be x = 900 - (number who own at least one of A, B, C).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me approach it step by step.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- a: number of people who own exactly A and D (so exactly one item)\n- b: exactly B and D\n- c: exactly C and D\n- ab: exactly A, B, and D (so exactly two items)\n- ac: exactly A, C, and D\n- bc: exactly B, C, and D\n- abc: exactly A, B, C, and D (all four items)\n\nSo, the total is a + b + c + ab + ac + bc + abc = 900.\n\nThe number of people who own exactly two of the four items is ab + ac + bc = 437.\n\nThe number of people who own exactly three of the four items is abc = 234.\n\nSo, substituting, we have:\n\na + b + c + 437 + 234 = 900 \u2192 a + b + c = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229.\n\nNow, the total number of people who own A is a + ab + ac + abc = 195.\n\nSimilarly, the total owning B is b + ab + bc + abc = 367.\n\nAnd the total owning C is c + ac + bc + abc = 562.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1. a + ab + ac + abc = 195\n2. b + ab + bc + abc = 367\n3. c + ac + bc + abc = 562\n\nAnd we know that ab + ac + bc = 437 and abc = 234.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c = 229.\n\nLet me also denote P = ab + ac + bc = 437.\n\nAnd T = abc = 234.\n\nNow, let me write the three equations again:\n\n1. a + (ab + ac) + T = 195 \u2192 a + (P - bc) + T = 195 \u2192 a + 437 - bc + 234 = 195 \u2192 a - bc = 195 - 437 - 234 = 195 - 671 = -476 \u2192 a - bc = -476.\n\nSimilarly, equation 2:\n\nb + (ab + bc) + T = 367 \u2192 b + (P - ac) + T = 367 \u2192 b + 437 - ac + 234 = 367 \u2192 b - ac = 367 - 671 = -304 \u2192 b - ac = -304.\n\nEquation 3:\n\nc + (ac + bc) + T = 562 \u2192 c + (P - ab) + T = 562 \u2192 c + 437 - ab + 234 = 562 \u2192 c - ab = 562 - 671 = -109 \u2192 c - ab = -109.\n\nHmm, now I have three new equations:\n\n1. a - bc = -476\n2. b - ac = -304\n3. c - ab = -109\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe I can find a way to express a, b, c in terms of ab, ac, bc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that a + b + c = 229 and ab + ac + bc = 437.\n\nLet me denote ab = x, ac = y, bc = z.\n\nThen, ab = x, ac = y, bc = z.\n\nSo, from the equations above:\n\na - z = -476 \u2192 a = z - 476.\n\nb - y = -304 \u2192 b = y - 304.\n\nc - x = -109 \u2192 c = x - 109.\n\nNow, since a + b + c = 229, substituting:\n\n(z - 476) + (y - 304) + (x - 109) = 229.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx + y + z - (476 + 304 + 109) = 229.\n\nCompute 476 + 304 = 780; 780 + 109 = 889.\n\nSo,\n\nx + y + z - 889 = 229 \u2192 x + y + z = 229 + 889 = 1118.\n\nBut wait, earlier we have ab + ac + bc = 437, which is x + y + z = 437. But now we have x + y + z = 1118, which is a contradiction. That can't be right. So, I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to rethink this. Perhaps my initial setup is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's go back. I think the mistake might be in how I set up the equations for a, b, c.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Since the problem gives the number of people who own exactly two and exactly three of the four items, perhaps I can use the formula for the number of people owning exactly k items.\n\nThe formula for exactly two items is C(4,2) = 6 possible pairs, but in our case, since D is universal, the exactly two items would be D plus one of A, B, C. So, the number of people who own exactly two is the sum of those who own D and exactly one of A, B, C. So, the 437 is the sum of a, b, c, where a, b, c are the numbers owning exactly D+A, D+B, D+C respectively.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a better way to model it.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- a = number owning exactly D and A (so exactly two items)\n- b = exactly D and B\n- c = exactly D and C\n\nThen, the number of people who own exactly two items is a + b + c = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people who own exactly three items is those who own D and exactly two of A, B, C. Let me denote:\n\n- ab = exactly D, A, B\n- ac = exactly D, A, C\n- bc = exactly D, B, C\n\nSo, ab + ac + bc = 234.\n\nAnd the number of people who own all four items is exactly D, A, B, C, which is abc = the number we're trying to find.\n\nWait, but in this case, the number of people who own exactly three items (D plus two others) is 234. So, ab + ac + bc = 234.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it says that 437 own exactly two of the four things, which would be D plus one other. So, a + b + c = 437.\n\nNow, the total number of people is:\n\n- Those who own exactly one item: only D. Let's call this x.\n- Those who own exactly two items: a + b + c = 437\n- Those who own exactly three items: ab + ac + bc = 234\n- Those who own all four items: abc = ?\n\nSo, the total is x + 437 + 234 + abc = 900 \u2192 x + abc = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229.\n\nNow, the total number of people who own A is the sum of those who own exactly A and D (a), those who own A, B, D (ab), those who own A, C, D (ac), and those who own all four (abc). So:\n\nn(A) = a + ab + ac + abc = 195.\n\nSimilarly, n(B) = b + ab + bc + abc = 367.\n\nn(C) = c + ac + bc + abc = 562.\n\nNow, let me write these equations:\n\n1. a + ab + ac + abc = 195\n2. b + ab + bc + abc = 367\n3. c + ac + bc + abc = 562\n\nWe also know that:\n\n4. a + b + c = 437\n5. ab + ac + bc = 234\n6. x + abc = 229 \u2192 x = 229 - abc.\n\nOur goal is to find abc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can subtract the sum of equations 1, 2, and 3 to find a relation.\n\nLet me add equations 1, 2, and 3:\n\n(a + ab + ac + abc) + (b + ab + bc + abc) + (c + ac + bc + abc) ) = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\na + b + c + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc + 3abc = 1124.\n\nWe know from equation 4 that a + b + c = 437.\n\nFrom equation 5, ab + ac + bc = 234.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n437 + 2*(234) + 3*abc = 1124.\n\nCompute 2*234 = 468.\n\nSo,\n\n437 + 468 + 3abc = 1124 \u2192 905 + 3abc = 1124 \u2192 3abc = 1124 - 905 = 219 \u2192 abc = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nSo, abc = 73.\n\nWait, so the number of people who own all four items is 73.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the number of people who own all four items would be the same as those who own all three of A, B, C, but with D being universal, it's D plus all three, so yes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nSo, abc = 73.\n\nThen, x = 229 - abc = 229 - 73 = 156.\n\nSo, 156 people own only D.\n\nNow, let's check if the numbers add up.\n\nFrom equation 1: a + ab + ac + abc = 195.\n\nWe can write a = 195 - ab - ac - abc.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: b = 367 - ab - bc - abc.\n\nFrom equation 3: c = 562 - ac - bc - abc.\n\nWe also know that a + b + c = 437.\n\nSubstituting a, b, c from above:\n\n(195 - ab - ac - abc) + (367 - ab - bc - abc) + (562 - ac - bc - abc) ) = 437.\n\nSimplify:\n\n195 + 367 + 562 - 2ab - 2ac - 2bc - 3abc = 437.\n\nCompute 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSo,\n\n1124 - 2(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 437.\n\nWe know ab + ac + bc = 234, and abc =73.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n1124 - 2*234 - 3*73 = ?\n\nCompute 2*234 = 468; 3*73 = 219.\n\nSo,\n\n1124 - 468 = 656; 656 - 219 = 437.\n\nWhich matches the right-hand side. So, the numbers check out.\n\nTherefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many residents of Aimeville own all four things: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let me list out what I know. There are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's one thing everyone has. Then, some own a diamond ring, some own golf clubs, and some own a garden spade. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 respectively.\n\nWait, so the candy hearts are universal. That might simplify things a bit because it means the total number of items isn't all over the place. Now, the problem also says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. I'm supposed to find how many own all four.\n\nI remember that in problems involving sets and their overlaps, the principle of inclusion-exclusion is really useful. Maybe I can apply that here. Let me recall the formula for four sets, but I think it's a bit complicated. Alternatively, since the candy hearts are universal, maybe I can model the problem with three sets instead of four.\n\nWait, actually, the four things are the diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. But since everyone has candy hearts, maybe it's easier to consider the other three as sets and the fourth as the universal set. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model it using the three items (diamond, golf, garden) and the fact that everyone has candy hearts. So each resident's ownership can be represented in terms of the other three items. Maybe I can ignore the candy hearts since they're universal and just focus on the other three, but I have to remember that all the ownerships are in addition to the candy hearts.\n\nWait, but the problem is about owning all four, which includes the candy hearts. Since everyone already has candy hearts, owning all four is just owning the other three plus candy hearts. But since candy hearts are already owned by everyone, it's the same as owning all three of the other items. So maybe the number of people who own all four is equal to the number of people who own all three of the other items. Hmm, that might be useful.\n\nLet me try to model this with the inclusion-exclusion principle. Let me denote:\n\n- Let A be the set of people who own a diamond ring.\n- Let B be the set of people who own golf clubs.\n- Let C be the set of people who own a garden spade.\n- Let D be the set of people who own candy hearts. Since everyone owns D, D is the universal set, so |D|=900.\n\nBut since D is universal, any intersection involving D is just the other set. So when considering A \u2229 D, it's just A. So maybe it's easier to think of the problem in terms of the three sets A, B, C, with the universal set being D.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the four items, but since D is universal, maybe the problem reduces to three sets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets, but considering that all are subsets of D, which is size 900.\n\nWait, perhaps the standard inclusion-exclusion formula applies to the three sets A, B, C. Let me think.\n\nThe formula for three sets is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nBut in this case, the total number of people is 900, but how many of them own at least one of A, B, or C? Wait, but the problem says that each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So the only thing that varies is whether they own the other three. So, the total number of people is 900, and each person owns D (candy hearts) plus some combination of A, B, C.\n\nBut the problem mentions that 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, perhaps we can model this using the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nWait, but the problem is about all four, so perhaps I can think in terms of the Venn diagram for three sets A, B, C, and then account for those who have exactly two or three of them.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- a: number of people who own exactly A only.\n- b: exactly B only.\n- c: exactly C only.\n- ab: exactly A and B only.\n- ac: exactly A and C only.\n- bc: exactly B and C only.\n- abc: exactly A, B, and C.\n\nSo, the total number of people who own exactly two is ab + ac + bc = 437.\n\nThe total number of people who own exactly three is abc = 234.\n\nNow, the total number of people is 900, but since everyone owns D, which is candy hearts, each person's ownership is D plus some combination of A, B, C.\n\nBut wait, actually, each person owns D plus some subset of A, B, C. So the counts for exactly two or three include D as well. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as the number of people who own exactly two of the four items. But wait, since D is always owned, owning exactly two of the four would mean owning D plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would mean D plus two others, and exactly four would mean D plus all three.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the 437 who own exactly two of the four items would be those who own D plus exactly one of A, B, or C. Similarly, the 234 who own exactly three of the four items would be those who own D plus exactly two of A, B, C. And the ones who own all four would be those who own D plus all three, which is the same as owning all four, which is the same as the number of people who own A, B, and C.\n\nWait, so if I can find the number of people who own all three of A, B, and C, that would be the number who own all four items, since D is universal.\n\nSo, maybe I can model this as follows:\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- n(A) = 195\n- n(B) = 367\n- n(C) = 562\n\nWe need to find n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C), which would be the number of people who own all four items, since D is universal.\n\nBut to find n(A \u2229 B \u2229 C), I can use inclusion-exclusion for three sets.\n\nWait, but I also have information about exactly two and exactly three. So perhaps I can model the total number of people as the sum of all possible ownership categories.\n\nWait, each person can be in one of the following categories:\n\n- Owns exactly one of A, B, C (along with D)\n- Owns exactly two of A, B, C (along with D)\n- Owns exactly three of A, B, C (along with D)\n\nSince D is universal, the total number of people is the sum of these categories.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- a = number of people who own exactly A and D (so only A and D)\n- b = exactly B and D\n- c = exactly C and D\n- ab = exactly A, B, and D (so exactly two of A, B, C plus D)\n- ac = exactly A, C, and D\n- bc = exactly B, C, and D\n- abc = exactly A, B, C, and D (so all four)\n\nSo the total number of people is:\n\na + b + c + ab + ac + bc + abc = 900\n\nNow, the number of people who own exactly two of the four things is ab + ac + bc = 437.\n\nThe number of people who own exactly three of the four things is abc = 234.\n\nWait, but the problem states that 437 own exactly two of the four, and 234 own exactly three. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the total number of people is 900, so substituting:\n\na + b + c + (ab + ac + bc) + abc = 900\n\nWe know that ab + ac + bc = 437, and abc = 234. So:\n\na + b + c + 437 + 234 = 900\n\nWhich simplifies to a + b + c = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, a + b + c = 229.\n\nNow, I can also express the total number of people owning A, B, or C as:\n\nn(A) + n(B) + n(C) = (a + ab + ac + abc) + (b + ab + bc + abc) + (c + ac + bc + abc)\n\nWait, no, more accurately:\n\nn(A) = a + ab + ac + abc\n\nSimilarly, n(B) = b + ab + bc + abc\n\nn(C) = c + ac + bc + abc\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\nn(A) + n(B) + n(C) = (a + b + c) + 2(ab + ac + bc) + 3(abc)\n\nWe know n(A) = 195, n(B)=367, n(C)=562.\n\nSo, sum is 195 + 367 + 562 = let's compute that.\n\n195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSo, 1124 = (a + b + c) + 2*(437) + 3*(234)\n\nWe know a + b + c = 229, so plug that in:\n\n1124 = 229 + 2*437 + 3*234\n\nLet me compute 2*437: 874\n\n3*234: 702\n\nSo, 229 + 874 = 1103; 1103 + 702 = 1805\n\nWait, but that's 1124 on the left, but 1805 on the right. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nHmm, maybe I got the inclusion-exclusion formula wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the standard inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets, which is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nBut in this case, |A \u222a B \u222a C| is the number of people who own at least one of A, B, or C. But since everyone owns D, and D is separate, but A, B, C are subsets of D.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the residents can own any combination of A, B, C, along with D. So, the total number of people is the number of people who own at least one of A, B, C plus those who don't own any of A, B, C.\n\nWait, but since everyone owns D, but they might not own any of A, B, C. So, the total is 900 = (number of people who own at least one of A, B, C) + (number who own only D).\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't mention the number of people who own only D. So perhaps that's part of the equation.\n\nWait, let me try to model it again.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- x = number of people who own only D (no A, B, C)\n- y = number who own exactly one of A, B, C along with D\n- z = number who own exactly two of A, B, C along with D\n- w = number who own all three A, B, C along with D\n\nSo, total people = x + y + z + w = 900.\n\nWe know that z = 437 (exactly two of A, B, C plus D), and w = 234 (exactly three of A, B, C plus D).\n\nSo, x + y + 437 + 234 = 900 \u2192 x + y = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nNow, the total number of people owning A is 195. Let's express this in terms of y and z and w.\n\nn(A) = (number owning only A) + (number owning A and B only) + (number owning A and C only) + (number owning A, B, C).\n\nSimilarly for n(B) and n(C).\n\nSo, n(A) = a + ab + ac + abc, where a is only A, ab is A and B, ac is A and C, and abc is all three.\n\nSimilarly, n(B) = b + ab + bc + abc\n\nn(C) = c + ac + bc + abc\n\nBut in our variables:\n\ny is the sum of a + b + c.\n\nz is the sum of ab + ac + bc.\n\nw is abc.\n\nSo, n(A) = a + (ab + ac) + abc = a + (ab + ac) + w.\n\nBut ab + ac is part of z, which is 437. So, ab + ac = (z - bc).\n\nWait, this might not be the easiest way.\n\nAlternatively, let me express n(A) as:\n\nn(A) = a + ab + ac + abc = (a) + (ab + ac) + abc.\n\nSimilarly, n(B) = b + ab + bc + abc, and n(C) = c + ac + bc + abc.\n\nSo, if I add n(A) + n(B) + n(C):\n\nn(A) + n(B) + n(C) = (a + b + c) + 2(ab + ac + bc) + 3(abc)\n\nWe know that a + b + c = y, ab + ac + bc = z, and abc = w.\n\nSo,\n\nn(A) + n(B) + n(C) = y + 2z + 3w\n\nWe have n(A) + n(B) + n(C) = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.\n\nAnd y + 2z + 3w = 1124.\n\nWe know that z = 437, w = 234, and x + y = 229.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\ny + 2*437 + 3*234 = 1124\n\nCompute 2*437 = 874\n\n3*234 = 702\n\nSo, 874 + 702 = 1576\n\nSo, y + 1576 = 1124 \u2192 y = 1124 - 1576 = -452\n\nWait, that can't be right. y is the number of people who own exactly one of A, B, C, which can't be negative. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nHmm, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect. Maybe I need to model it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets, considering that each resident has D, which is universal. Let me think.\n\nThe total number of residents is 900. The number of people who own at least one of A, B, or C is equal to the sum of the individual sets minus the pairwise intersections plus the triple intersection.\n\nBut in this case, since D is universal, the number of people who don't own A, B, or C is x, which is 900 - (number owning at least one of A, B, C).\n\nBut maybe that's not directly helpful. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the problem without considering D, since D is universal. Let me think of the problem as three sets A, B, C, each being a subset of the universal set of 900 residents. Then, the number of people who own exactly two of A, B, C is 437, and exactly three is 234.\n\nBut wait, no, because in the problem, the 437 own exactly two of the four things, which includes D. So, exactly two would be owning D plus one of A, B, C. Similarly, exactly three would be D plus two of A, B, C. And exactly four would be D plus all three.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a better way to model it.\n\nSo, the number of people who own exactly two of the four items is the number of people who own D and exactly one of A, B, C. Similarly, exactly three would be D plus exactly two of A, B, C. And exactly four is D plus all three of A, B, C.\n\nSo, the total number of people who own exactly one item (only D) would be x = 900 - (number who own at least one of A, B, C).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me approach it step by step.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- a: number of people who own exactly A and D (so exactly one item)\n- b: exactly B and D\n- c: exactly C and D\n- ab: exactly A, B, and D (so exactly two items)\n- ac: exactly A, C, and D\n- bc: exactly B, C, and D\n- abc: exactly A, B, C, and D (all four items)\n\nSo, the total is a + b + c + ab + ac + bc + abc = 900.\n\nThe number of people who own exactly two of the four items is ab + ac + bc = 437.\n\nThe number of people who own exactly three of the four items is abc = 234.\n\nSo, substituting, we have:\n\na + b + c + 437 + 234 = 900 \u2192 a + b + c = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229.\n\nNow, the total number of people who own A is a + ab + ac + abc = 195.\n\nSimilarly, the total owning B is b + ab + bc + abc = 367.\n\nAnd the total owning C is c + ac + bc + abc = 562.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1. a + ab + ac + abc = 195\n2. b + ab + bc + abc = 367\n3. c + ac + bc + abc = 562\n\nAnd we know that ab + ac + bc = 437 and abc = 234.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c = 229.\n\nLet me also denote P = ab + ac + bc = 437.\n\nAnd T = abc = 234.\n\nNow, let me write the three equations again:\n\n1. a + (ab + ac) + T = 195 \u2192 a + (P - bc) + T = 195 \u2192 a + 437 - bc + 234 = 195 \u2192 a - bc = 195 - 437 - 234 = 195 - 671 = -476 \u2192 a - bc = -476.\n\nSimilarly, equation 2:\n\nb + (ab + bc) + T = 367 \u2192 b + (P - ac) + T = 367 \u2192 b + 437 - ac + 234 = 367 \u2192 b - ac = 367 - 671 = -304 \u2192 b - ac = -304.\n\nEquation 3:\n\nc + (ac + bc) + T = 562 \u2192 c + (P - ab) + T = 562 \u2192 c + 437 - ab + 234 = 562 \u2192 c - ab = 562 - 671 = -109 \u2192 c - ab = -109.\n\nHmm, now I have three new equations:\n\n1. a - bc = -476\n2. b - ac = -304\n3. c - ab = -109\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe I can find a way to express a, b, c in terms of ab, ac, bc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that a + b + c = 229 and ab + ac + bc = 437.\n\nLet me denote ab = x, ac = y, bc = z.\n\nThen, ab = x, ac = y, bc = z.\n\nSo, from the equations above:\n\na - z = -476 \u2192 a = z - 476.\n\nb - y = -304 \u2192 b = y - 304.\n\nc - x = -109 \u2192 c = x - 109.\n\nNow, since a + b + c = 229, substituting:\n\n(z - 476) + (y - 304) + (x - 109) = 229.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx + y + z - (476 + 304 + 109) = 229.\n\nCompute 476 + 304 = 780; 780 + 109 = 889.\n\nSo,\n\nx + y + z - 889 = 229 \u2192 x + y + z = 229 + 889 = 1118.\n\nBut wait, earlier we have ab + ac + bc = 437, which is x + y + z = 437. But now we have x + y + z = 1118, which is a contradiction. That can't be right. So, I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to rethink this. Perhaps my initial setup is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's go back. I think the mistake might be in how I set up the equations for a, b, c.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Since the problem gives the number of people who own exactly two and exactly three of the four items, perhaps I can use the formula for the number of people owning exactly k items.\n\nThe formula for exactly two items is C(4,2) = 6 possible pairs, but in our case, since D is universal, the exactly two items would be D plus one of A, B, C. So, the number of people who own exactly two is the sum of those who own D and exactly one of A, B, C. So, the 437 is the sum of a, b, c, where a, b, c are the numbers owning exactly D+A, D+B, D+C respectively.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a better way to model it.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- a = number owning exactly D and A (so exactly two items)\n- b = exactly D and B\n- c = exactly D and C\n\nThen, the number of people who own exactly two items is a + b + c = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people who own exactly three items is those who own D and exactly two of A, B, C. Let me denote:\n\n- ab = exactly D, A, B\n- ac = exactly D, A, C\n- bc = exactly D, B, C\n\nSo, ab + ac + bc = 234.\n\nAnd the number of people who own all four items is exactly D, A, B, C, which is abc = the number we're trying to find.\n\nWait, but in this case, the number of people who own exactly three items (D plus two others) is 234. So, ab + ac + bc = 234.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it says that 437 own exactly two of the four things, which would be D plus one other. So, a + b + c = 437.\n\nNow, the total number of people is:\n\n- Those who own exactly one item: only D. Let's call this x.\n- Those who own exactly two items: a + b + c = 437\n- Those who own exactly three items: ab + ac + bc = 234\n- Those who own all four items: abc = ?\n\nSo, the total is x + 437 + 234 + abc = 900 \u2192 x + abc = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229.\n\nNow, the total number of people who own A is the sum of those who own exactly A and D (a), those who own A, B, D (ab), those who own A, C, D (ac), and those who own all four (abc). So:\n\nn(A) = a + ab + ac + abc = 195.\n\nSimilarly, n(B) = b + ab + bc + abc = 367.\n\nn(C) = c + ac + bc + abc = 562.\n\nNow, let me write these equations:\n\n1. a + ab + ac + abc = 195\n2. b + ab + bc + abc = 367\n3. c + ac + bc + abc = 562\n\nWe also know that:\n\n4. a + b + c = 437\n5. ab + ac + bc = 234\n6. x + abc = 229 \u2192 x = 229 - abc.\n\nOur goal is to find abc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can subtract the sum of equations 1, 2, and 3 to find a relation.\n\nLet me add equations 1, 2, and 3:\n\n(a + ab + ac + abc) + (b + ab + bc + abc) + (c + ac + bc + abc) ) = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\na + b + c + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc + 3abc = 1124.\n\nWe know from equation 4 that a + b + c = 437.\n\nFrom equation 5, ab + ac + bc = 234.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n437 + 2*(234) + 3*abc = 1124.\n\nCompute 2*234 = 468.\n\nSo,\n\n437 + 468 + 3abc = 1124 \u2192 905 + 3abc = 1124 \u2192 3abc = 1124 - 905 = 219 \u2192 abc = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nSo, abc = 73.\n\nWait, so the number of people who own all four items is 73.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the number of people who own all four items would be the same as those who own all three of A, B, C, but with D being universal, it's D plus all three, so yes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nSo, abc = 73.\n\nThen, x = 229 - abc = 229 - 73 = 156.\n\nSo, 156 people own only D.\n\nNow, let's check if the numbers add up.\n\nFrom equation 1: a + ab + ac + abc = 195.\n\nWe can write a = 195 - ab - ac - abc.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: b = 367 - ab - bc - abc.\n\nFrom equation 3: c = 562 - ac - bc - abc.\n\nWe also know that a + b + c = 437.\n\nSubstituting a, b, c from above:\n\n(195 - ab - ac - abc) + (367 - ab - bc - abc) + (562 - ac - bc - abc) ) = 437.\n\nSimplify:\n\n195 + 367 + 562 - 2ab - 2ac - 2bc - 3abc = 437.\n\nCompute 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSo,\n\n1124 - 2(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 437.\n\nWe know ab + ac + bc = 234, and abc =73.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n1124 - 2*234 - 3*73 = ?\n\nCompute 2*234 = 468; 3*73 = 219.\n\nSo,\n\n1124 - 468 = 656; 656 - 219 = 437.\n\nWhich matches the right-hand side. So, the numbers check out.\n\nTherefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of residents in Aimeville who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Since every resident owns the candy hearts, the problem can be modeled using three sets (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) with the candy hearts being universal.\n\nLet:\n- \\( a \\) = number of people who own exactly one of the three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) along with candy hearts.\n- \\( ab \\), \\( ac \\), \\( bc \\) = numbers of people who own exactly two of the three items along with candy hearts.\n- \\( abc \\) = number of people who own all three items along with candy hearts.\n\nGiven:\n- Total residents = 900.\n- Residents owning exactly two items = 437.\n- Residents owning exactly three items = 234.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\\[\na + ab + ac + abc = 195 \\quad \\text{(diamond ring owners)}\n\\]\n\\[\nb + ab + bc + abc = 367 \\quad \\text{(golf clubs owners)}\n\\]\n\\[\nc + ac + bc + abc = 562 \\quad \\text{(garden spade owners)}\n\\]\n\\[\na + b + c = 437 \\quad \\text{(exactly two items)}\n\\]\n\\[\nab + ac + bc = 234 \\quad \\text{(exactly three items)}\n\\]\n\nAdding the three equations:\n\\[\n(a + ab + ac + abc) + (b + ab + bc + abc) + (c + ac + bc + abc) = 195 + 367 + 562\n\\]\n\\[\na + b + c + 2(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc = 1124\n\\]\nSubstituting known values:\n\\[\n437 + 2(234) + 3abc = 1124\n\\]\n\\[\n437 + 468 + 3abc = 1124\n\\]\n\\[\n905 + 3abc = 1124\n\\]\n\\[\n3abc = 219 \\implies abc = 73\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four items is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{73}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here about residents of Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me list down all the given information:\n\n- Total residents: 900.\n- Number of people who own a diamond ring: 195.\n- Number of people who own a set of golf clubs: 367.\n- Number of people who own a garden spade: 562.\n- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's 900 people.\n  \nWait, so candy hearts are owned by everyone. That means the set for candy hearts is the entire population. Hmm, that might simplify some parts.\n\nNext, there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four things.\n\nI think this is a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall that formula.\n\nInclusion-exclusion for four sets says that the total number of elements in the union is equal to the sum of the sizes of the sets minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the sum of all triple-wise intersections minus the four-way intersection. But wait, I'm not directly asked about the union. Instead, I have information about exactly two and exactly three. \n\nLet me denote the sets as follows:\n\n- Let D be the set of people who own a diamond ring.\n- Let G be those who own golf clubs.\n- Let S be those with a garden spade.\n- Let C be candy hearts (which is the entire set, so C = 900).\n\nEach resident owns at least a candy heart, so every resident is in set C. So, when we talk about owning other things, it's in addition to the candy hearts.\n\nBut in the problem, when it says someone owns exactly two things, does that include the candy hearts? Because everyone owns at least the candy hearts. So, for example, if someone owns exactly two things, that would be the candy hearts plus one other item. Similarly, someone who owns exactly three things has candy hearts plus two other items, and someone who owns all four has all three items plus candy hearts.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, the four things are: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, everyone has candy hearts. So, the four things are the four items, but since candy hearts are universal, it's actually about how many of the other three they have.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it with four sets, but since C is the entire universe, it's more about the other three.\n\nHmm, maybe I should think of the problem in terms of the other three items (D, G, S) and how they relate, considering that everyone has C.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused. Let me try to structure it.\n\nLet me denote the four things as D, G, S, and C (candy hearts). Since everyone has C, the presence of C is universal. So, the problem is about how many people have D, G, S, and C, and the counts of exactly two and exactly three things.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's one thing. Then, they can own 0, 1, 2, or 3 of the other things (D, G, S). So, the total number of items owned per person is 1 (candy hearts) plus the number of other things they own.\n\nSo, for a person, they can own exactly 1 (just candy hearts), exactly 2 (candy hearts plus one more), exactly 3 (candy hearts plus two more), or exactly 4 (all four). But the problem states that 437 own exactly two of these things. Wait, does that mean exactly two including candy hearts? Or exactly two of the non-candy hearts?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"437 residents who own exactly two of these things.\" So, the four things include candy hearts. So, someone who owns exactly two would have candy hearts plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would have candy hearts plus two others, and exactly four would have all three others plus candy hearts.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, candy hearts are a given, and the other three are optional. So, when they say \"exactly two of these things,\" they mean two in total, including candy hearts. So, that would mean they have candy hearts plus one more item.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If someone owns exactly two of the four things, and one of them is candy hearts, then the other must be either D, G, or S. So, they have two items: candy hearts and one other. Similarly, exactly three would have candy hearts and two others, and exactly four would have all four.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that 234 own exactly three of these things. So, that includes candy hearts plus two other items.\n\nSo, our goal is to find the number of people who own all four, which would be the same as owning all three other items plus candy hearts.\n\nGiven that, let's think about how to model this.\n\nWe have four sets: D, G, S, and C (which is everyone). The problem gives us the sizes of D, G, S, and C is 900. We also know the number of people owning exactly two things (437) and exactly three things (234). We need to find the number owning exactly four.\n\nWait, but how does this relate to inclusion-exclusion? Maybe I can model it with the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the counts of people owning 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 items. But since C is universal, everyone owns at least one item, so we don't have anyone owning 0. So, the possible ownership counts per person are 1, 2, 3, or 4 items.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so they all have at least that. So, the number of people owning exactly one thing is those who have only candy hearts. The number owning exactly two is candy hearts plus one other, exactly three is candy hearts plus two others, and exactly four is all four.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's given that 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. So, the number of people owning exactly four is what we're after.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let x be the number of people who own exactly four things (all four: D, G, S, C). So, x is what we're trying to find.\n\n- The number owning exactly three things: 234. These people have C plus two of D, G, S. So, they are in two of the three sets D, G, S, and in C.\n\n- The number owning exactly two things: 437. These have C plus one of D, G, S. So, they are in exactly one of D, G, S, and C.\n\n- The number owning exactly one thing: Only C. Let's call this number y. So, y = number of people with only C.\n\nNow, let's think about the total number of people: 900. So,\n\ny + 437 + 234 + x = 900.\n\nSimplify that:\n\ny + 437 + 234 + x = 900\n\ny + x = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, y + x = 229.\n\nBut I don't know y or x yet.\n\nNow, let's think about the counts of each set:\n\n- |D| = 195. This includes people who own D and possibly other things.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- |G| = 367.\n\n- |S| = 562.\n\nEach of these includes people who have only that item plus C, as well as those who have that item plus others.\n\nWait, but in our previous definitions, y is the number of people with only C, and x is the number with all four. Let's think about how each set's count is built.\n\nFor set D: the 195 people who own D include:\n\n- Those who have only D and C: Let's call this a.\n\n- Those who have D and another item, plus C: which would be the people with exactly two things, but only D and one other.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the people who own D can be categorized as:\n\n- Only D and C: a.\n\n- D and another item (G or S) and C: which would be in the exactly two and exactly three categories.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider how many people are in each set, considering their ownership counts.\n\nEach person who owns exactly two things must have C plus one other (D, G, or S). So, for each of the pairs (D&C, G&C, S&C), the number of people owning exactly two is the number of people in exactly two sets.\n\nWait, but no, because exactly two would be C plus one other, so the counts for D, G, S each include the number of people who have only D and C, plus those who have D and another item (and C), etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to model the counts using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for the sets D, G, S, considering that everyone is in C.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets (D, G, S) and how they relate to the counts.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|.\n\nBut since C is universal, the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to the number of people owning exactly one, two, or three of D, G, S, plus those owning all three (since C is already included). Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the counts of D, G, S in terms of how many people are in each set, considering the ownership levels.\n\nEach of the sets D, G, S includes people who have:\n\n- Only D and C,\n\n- D and another item and C,\n\n- All three items and C.\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nSo, the total number of people in D is:\n\nnumber with only D and C (a) + number with D, G, and C (let's say b) + number with D, S, and C (c) + number with D, G, S, and C (x).\n\nSo,\n\n|D| = a + b + c + x = 195.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n|G| = d + b + e + x = 367,\n\nwhere d is the number with only G and C, e is the number with G and S and C.\n\n|S| = f + c + e + x = 562,\n\nwhere f is the number with only S and C.\n\nAdditionally, the number of people with exactly two things is 437. These would be the people who have C and exactly one other item.\n\nSo, the number of people with exactly two things is a + d + f = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people with exactly three things is the number who have C and two other items. So, that's b + c + e = 234.\n\nAnd the number of people with exactly four things is x.\n\nWe also have the equation earlier:\n\ny + x = 229,\n\nwhere y is the number of people with only C.\n\nAdditionally, the total number of people is:\n\ny + (a + d + f) + (b + c + e) + x = y + 437 + 234 + x = 900.\n\nWhich gives y + x = 229.\n\nBut I need more equations to solve for x.\n\nWait, let's think about the total number of people in each set.\n\nWe have |D| = a + b + c + x = 195.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n|G| = d + b + e + x = 367,\n\n|S| = f + c + e + x = 562.\n\nWe also have:\n\na + d + f = 437,\n\nand\n\nb + c + e = 234.\n\nAdditionally,\n\ny + x = 229.\n\nHmm, that's a lot of equations. Let me list them:\n\n1. a + b + c + x = 195.  --> Equation (1)\n\n2. d + b + e + x = 367.  --> Equation (2)\n\n3. f + c + e + x = 562.  --> Equation (3)\n\n4. a + d + f = 437.      --> Equation (4)\n\n5. b + c + e = 234.      --> Equation (5)\n\n6. y + x = 229.          --> Equation (6)\n\nWe have six equations with variables a, b, c, d, e, f, y, x. That's eight variables. Hmm, perhaps I can express some variables in terms of others.\n\nLet me see. From Equation (4): a + d + f = 437. So, if I can express a, d, f in terms of other variables, that would help.\n\nFrom Equation (5): b + c + e = 234.\n\nWait, maybe I can sum Equations (1), (2), and (3) to get something.\n\nAdding Equations (1), (2), (3):\n\n(a + b + c + x) + (d + b + e + x) + (f + c + e + x) = 195 + 367 + 562.\n\nSimplify:\n\na + b + c + x + d + b + e + x + f + c + e + x = 1124.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(a + d + f) + 2b + 2c + 2e + 3x = 1124.\n\nWe know from Equation (4) that (a + d + f) = 437.\n\nAnd from Equation (5), (b + c + e) = 234.\n\nSo substitute these into the equation:\n\n437 + 2*(234) + 3x = 1124.\n\nCompute 2*234: 468.\n\nSo,\n\n437 + 468 + 3x = 1124.\n\nSum 437 + 468: 905.\n\nSo,\n\n905 + 3x = 1124.\n\nSubtract 905 from both sides:\n\n3x = 1124 - 905 = 219.\n\nSo,\n\nx = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nSo, x is 73.\n\nWait, that's the number of people who own all four things, which is what we're asked to find. So, the answer is 73.\n\nBut let me verify to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, x = 73.\n\nThen from Equation (6), y = 229 - x = 229 -73 = 156.\n\nSo, y = 156.\n\nNow, let's see if the other equations make sense.\n\nFrom Equation (5): b + c + e = 234.\n\nFrom Equations (1), (2), (3):\n\nEquation (1): a + b + c + 73 = 195 \u2192 a + b + c = 122.\n\nEquation (2): d + b + e +73 =367 \u2192 d + b + e = 294.\n\nEquation (3): f + c + e +73=562 \u2192 f + c + e = 489.\n\nAlso, Equation (4): a + d + f =437.\n\nNow, from Equation (1): a = 122 - b - c.\n\nFrom Equation (2): d = 294 - b - e.\n\nFrom Equation (3): f = 489 - c - e.\n\nNow, substituting into Equation (4):\n\na + d + f = (122 - b - c) + (294 - b - e) + (489 - c - e) = 437.\n\nCompute:\n\n122 + 294 + 489 = 905.\n\nThen, the terms:\n\n(-b - c) + (-b - e) + (-c - e) = -2b -2c -2e.\n\nSo,\n\n905 - 2(b + c + e) = 437.\n\nBut from Equation (5), b + c + e =234.\n\nSo,\n\n905 - 2*234 = 905 - 468 = 437.\n\nWhich matches. So, the equations are consistent.\n\nTherefore, x=73 is correct.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem here about residents of Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me list down all the given information:\n\n- Total residents: 900.\n- Number of people who own a diamond ring: 195.\n- Number of people who own a set of golf clubs: 367.\n- Number of people who own a garden spade: 562.\n- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's 900 people.\n  \nWait, so candy hearts are owned by everyone. That means the set for candy hearts is the entire population. Hmm, that might simplify some parts.\n\nNext, there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four things.\n\nI think this is a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall that formula.\n\nInclusion-exclusion for four sets says that the total number of elements in the union is equal to the sum of the sizes of the sets minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the sum of all triple-wise intersections minus the four-way intersection. But wait, I'm not directly asked about the union. Instead, I have information about exactly two and exactly three. \n\nLet me denote the sets as follows:\n\n- Let D be the set of people who own a diamond ring.\n- Let G be those who own golf clubs.\n- Let S be those with a garden spade.\n- Let C be candy hearts (which is the entire set, so C = 900).\n\nEach resident owns at least a candy heart, so every resident is in set C. So, when we talk about owning other things, it's in addition to the candy hearts.\n\nBut in the problem, when it says someone owns exactly two things, does that include the candy hearts? Because everyone owns at least the candy hearts. So, for example, if someone owns exactly two things, that would be the candy hearts plus one other item. Similarly, someone who owns exactly three things has candy hearts plus two other items, and someone who owns all four has all three items plus candy hearts.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, the four things are: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, everyone has candy hearts. So, the four things are the four items, but since candy hearts are universal, it's actually about how many of the other three they have.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it with four sets, but since C is the entire universe, it's more about the other three.\n\nHmm, maybe I should think of the problem in terms of the other three items (D, G, S) and how they relate, considering that everyone has C.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused. Let me try to structure it.\n\nLet me denote the four things as D, G, S, and C (candy hearts). Since everyone has C, the presence of C is universal. So, the problem is about how many people have D, G, S, and C, and the counts of exactly two and exactly three things.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's one thing. Then, they can own 0, 1, 2, or 3 of the other things (D, G, S). So, the total number of items owned per person is 1 (candy hearts) plus the number of other things they own.\n\nSo, for a person, they can own exactly 1 (just candy hearts), exactly 2 (candy hearts plus one more), exactly 3 (candy hearts plus two more), or exactly 4 (all four). But the problem states that 437 own exactly two of these things. Wait, does that mean exactly two including candy hearts? Or exactly two of the non-candy hearts?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"437 residents who own exactly two of these things.\" So, the four things include candy hearts. So, someone who owns exactly two would have candy hearts plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would have candy hearts plus two others, and exactly four would have all three others plus candy hearts.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, candy hearts are a given, and the other three are optional. So, when they say \"exactly two of these things,\" they mean two in total, including candy hearts. So, that would mean they have candy hearts plus one more item.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If someone owns exactly two of the four things, and one of them is candy hearts, then the other must be either D, G, or S. So, they have two items: candy hearts and one other. Similarly, exactly three would have candy hearts and two others, and exactly four would have all four.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that 234 own exactly three of these things. So, that includes candy hearts plus two other items.\n\nSo, our goal is to find the number of people who own all four, which would be the same as owning all three other items plus candy hearts.\n\nGiven that, let's think about how to model this.\n\nWe have four sets: D, G, S, and C (which is everyone). The problem gives us the sizes of D, G, S, and C is 900. We also know the number of people owning exactly two things (437) and exactly three things (234). We need to find the number owning exactly four.\n\nWait, but how does this relate to inclusion-exclusion? Maybe I can model it with the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the counts of people owning 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 items. But since C is universal, everyone owns at least one item, so we don't have anyone owning 0. So, the possible ownership counts per person are 1, 2, 3, or 4 items.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so they all have at least that. So, the number of people owning exactly one thing is those who have only candy hearts. The number owning exactly two is candy hearts plus one other, exactly three is candy hearts plus two others, and exactly four is all four.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's given that 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. So, the number of people owning exactly four is what we're after.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let x be the number of people who own exactly four things (all four: D, G, S, C). So, x is what we're trying to find.\n\n- The number owning exactly three things: 234. These people have C plus two of D, G, S. So, they are in two of the three sets D, G, S, and in C.\n\n- The number owning exactly two things: 437. These have C plus one of D, G, S. So, they are in exactly one of D, G, S, and C.\n\n- The number owning exactly one thing: Only C. Let's call this number y. So, y = number of people with only C.\n\nNow, let's think about the total number of people: 900. So,\n\ny + 437 + 234 + x = 900.\n\nSimplify that:\n\ny + 437 + 234 + x = 900\n\ny + x = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, y + x = 229.\n\nBut I don't know y or x yet.\n\nNow, let's think about the counts of each set:\n\n- |D| = 195. This includes people who own D and possibly other things.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- |G| = 367.\n\n- |S| = 562.\n\nEach of these includes people who have only that item plus C, as well as those who have that item plus others.\n\nWait, but in our previous definitions, y is the number of people with only C, and x is the number with all four. Let's think about how each set's count is built.\n\nFor set D: the 195 people who own D include:\n\n- Those who have only D and C: Let's call this a.\n\n- Those who have D and another item, plus C: which would be the people with exactly two things, but only D and one other.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the people who own D can be categorized as:\n\n- Only D and C: a.\n\n- D and another item (G or S) and C: which would be in the exactly two and exactly three categories.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider how many people are in each set, considering their ownership counts.\n\nEach person who owns exactly two things must have C plus one other (D, G, or S). So, for each of the pairs (D&C, G&C, S&C), the number of people owning exactly two is the number of people in exactly two sets.\n\nWait, but no, because exactly two would be C plus one other, so the counts for D, G, S each include the number of people who have only D and C, plus those who have D and another item (and C), etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to model the counts using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for the sets D, G, S, considering that everyone is in C.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets (D, G, S) and how they relate to the counts.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|.\n\nBut since C is universal, the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to the number of people owning exactly one, two, or three of D, G, S, plus those owning all three (since C is already included). Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the counts of D, G, S in terms of how many people are in each set, considering the ownership levels.\n\nEach of the sets D, G, S includes people who have:\n\n- Only D and C,\n\n- D and another item and C,\n\n- All three items and C.\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nSo, the total number of people in D is:\n\nnumber with only D and C (a) + number with D, G, and C (let's say b) + number with D, S, and C (c) + number with D, G, S, and C (x).\n\nSo,\n\n|D| = a + b + c + x = 195.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n|G| = d + b + e + x = 367,\n\nwhere d is the number with only G and C, e is the number with G and S and C.\n\n|S| = f + c + e + x = 562,\n\nwhere f is the number with only S and C.\n\nAdditionally, the number of people with exactly two things is 437. These would be the people who have C and exactly one other item.\n\nSo, the number of people with exactly two things is a + d + f = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people with exactly three things is the number who have C and two other items. So, that's b + c + e = 234.\n\nAnd the number of people with exactly four things is x.\n\nWe also have the equation earlier:\n\ny + x = 229,\n\nwhere y is the number of people with only C.\n\nAdditionally, the total number of people is:\n\ny + (a + d + f) + (b + c + e) + x = y + 437 + 234 + x = 900.\n\nWhich gives y + x = 229.\n\nBut I need more equations to solve for x.\n\nWait, let's think about the total number of people in each set.\n\nWe have |D| = a + b + c + x = 195.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n|G| = d + b + e + x = 367,\n\n|S| = f + c + e + x = 562.\n\nWe also have:\n\na + d + f = 437,\n\nand\n\nb + c + e = 234.\n\nAdditionally,\n\ny + x = 229.\n\nHmm, that's a lot of equations. Let me list them:\n\n1. a + b + c + x = 195.  --> Equation (1)\n\n2. d + b + e + x = 367.  --> Equation (2)\n\n3. f + c + e + x = 562.  --> Equation (3)\n\n4. a + d + f = 437.      --> Equation (4)\n\n5. b + c + e = 234.      --> Equation (5)\n\n6. y + x = 229.          --> Equation (6)\n\nWe have six equations with variables a, b, c, d, e, f, y, x. That's eight variables. Hmm, perhaps I can express some variables in terms of others.\n\nLet me see. From Equation (4): a + d + f = 437. So, if I can express a, d, f in terms of other variables, that would help.\n\nFrom Equation (5): b + c + e = 234.\n\nWait, maybe I can sum Equations (1), (2), and (3) to get something.\n\nAdding Equations (1), (2), (3):\n\n(a + b + c + x) + (d + b + e + x) + (f + c + e + x) = 195 + 367 + 562.\n\nSimplify:\n\na + b + c + x + d + b + e + x + f + c + e + x = 1124.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(a + d + f) + 2b + 2c + 2e + 3x = 1124.\n\nWe know from Equation (4) that (a + d + f) = 437.\n\nAnd from Equation (5), (b + c + e) = 234.\n\nSo substitute these into the equation:\n\n437 + 2*(234) + 3x = 1124.\n\nCompute 2*234: 468.\n\nSo,\n\n437 + 468 + 3x = 1124.\n\nSum 437 + 468: 905.\n\nSo,\n\n905 + 3x = 1124.\n\nSubtract 905 from both sides:\n\n3x = 1124 - 905 = 219.\n\nSo,\n\nx = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nSo, x is 73.\n\nWait, that's the number of people who own all four things, which is what we're asked to find. So, the answer is 73.\n\nBut let me verify to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, x = 73.\n\nThen from Equation (6), y = 229 - x = 229 -73 = 156.\n\nSo, y = 156.\n\nNow, let's see if the other equations make sense.\n\nFrom Equation (5): b + c + e = 234.\n\nFrom Equations (1), (2), (3):\n\nEquation (1): a + b + c + 73 = 195 \u2192 a + b + c = 122.\n\nEquation (2): d + b + e +73 =367 \u2192 d + b + e = 294.\n\nEquation (3): f + c + e +73=562 \u2192 f + c + e = 489.\n\nAlso, Equation (4): a + d + f =437.\n\nNow, from Equation (1): a = 122 - b - c.\n\nFrom Equation (2): d = 294 - b - e.\n\nFrom Equation (3): f = 489 - c - e.\n\nNow, substituting into Equation (4):\n\na + d + f = (122 - b - c) + (294 - b - e) + (489 - c - e) = 437.\n\nCompute:\n\n122 + 294 + 489 = 905.\n\nThen, the terms:\n\n(-b - c) + (-b - e) + (-c - e) = -2b -2c -2e.\n\nSo,\n\n905 - 2(b + c + e) = 437.\n\nBut from Equation (5), b + c + e =234.\n\nSo,\n\n905 - 2*234 = 905 - 468 = 437.\n\nWhich matches. So, the equations are consistent.\n\nTherefore, x=73 is correct.\n\n\nThe number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n\n$\\boxed{73}$",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Hmm, let me try to parse it out. \n\nSo, there are 900 residents total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. Additionally, some own a diamond ring, some own a set of golf clubs, and others own a garden spade. The numbers are: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade. \n\nNow, the tricky part is the overlap. It says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We're supposed to find out how many own all four\u2014so the ones who have a diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Since everyone owns a candy heart, owning all four is the same as owning the other three and the candy hearts. \n\nWait, actually, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the candy hearts are universal. That means when they talk about owning exactly two or three things, they're only referring to the other three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade). Because the candy hearts are already included in everyone's ownership. \n\nSo, the problem is about three sets: diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and the universal set of candy hearts (C). But since C is universal, every resident has it. So, when considering ownership of exactly two or three things, we're only looking at D, G, S. \n\nWait, but the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the four things are: C, D, G, S. But since C is owned by everyone, the four-way intersection (all four) is just the people who have D, G, S, and C. But since C is universal, the four-way intersection is the same as the three-way intersection of D, G, S. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of people who have all three: D, G, S. Because the candy hearts are already included in all of them.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for all four, but since everyone has C, it's the same as those who have D, G, S. So, we need to find |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|, which is the same as |D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C|, since C is everyone. \n\nSo, how do we find |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|? I remember inclusion-exclusion principles. Let's think about the formula for three sets. \n\nThe inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nBut we don't know |D \u222a G \u222a S|. Wait, but the total number of residents is 900, and everyone has C, which is a bag of candy hearts. So, the maximum number of people who don't have any of D, G, S is 900 minus the number who have at least one of D, G, S. \n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't give us the number of people who have none of D, G, S. Hmm. But maybe we can find |D \u222a G \u222a S| by using the other information given about exactly two and exactly three.\n\nWait, let me think. The total number of people is 900. Each person owns at least C, which is a given. So, some own only C, some own C and one other, some own C and two others, and some own all four.\n\nWait, but the problem states that 437 own exactly two of these things. Wait, but which two? Because the \"things\" include C. Wait, no, the way the problem is phrased: \n\n\"there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\"\n\nWait, the \"these things\" refers to the four: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Because the problem says, \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, the four things are C, D, G, S.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me reread the problem.\n\n\"In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\"\n\nSo, the four things are: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, when it says 437 own exactly two of these things, it includes the candy hearts as one of the four.\n\nBut candy hearts are owned by everyone, so no one owns exactly two without including C. Because if someone owns exactly two things, one of them has to be C, since everyone has C.\n\nWait, that's an important point. Because C is universal, so any ownership count must include C. So, if someone owns exactly two of the four, it must be C plus one other. Similarly, someone owning exactly three must have C plus two others, and someone owning all four has C plus all three.\n\nWait, that changes things. So, the 437 owning exactly two of the four are those who own C and exactly one other item. Similarly, the 234 owning exactly three of the four are those owning C and exactly two others.\n\nSo, the problem is about four items, but since C is universal, the counts are adjusted.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let a = number of people who own exactly C only. (So, they own nothing else.)\n\n- Let b = number of people who own exactly C and D.\n\n- Let c = number of people who own exactly C and G.\n\n- Let d = number of people who own exactly C and S.\n\n- Let e = number of people who own exactly C, D, and G.\n\n- Let f = number of people who own exactly C, D, and S.\n\n- Let g = number of people who own exactly C, G, and S.\n\n- Let h = number of people who own all four: C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, the total number of people is a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900.\n\nNow, the number of people who own exactly two of the four things is b + c + d. Because those are the people who own exactly two: C plus one of D, G, S.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because in the problem statement, exactly two of the four things. So, if someone owns exactly two, they must have two of the four. But since everyone has C, the two must include C and one other. So, exactly two would be C and one more. So, b + c + d = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people who own exactly three of the four things is e + f + g. Because they have C and two others. So, e + f + g = 234.\n\nAnd the number of people who own all four is h. \n\nSo, the problem is asking for h.\n\nSo, our variables are a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, with the following equations:\n\n1. a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900 (total population)\n2. b + c + d = 437 (exactly two)\n3. e + f + g = 234 (exactly three)\n4. We need to find h.\n\nBut we also have the counts of people owning each of the items D, G, S.\n\nThe number of people owning D is 195. That includes:\n\nb (C and D only) + e (C, D, G) + f (C, D, S) + h (all four) = 195.\n\nSimilarly, the number owning G is 367: c + e + g + h = 367.\n\nThe number owning S is 562: d + f + g + h = 562.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nEquation 5: b + e + f + h = 195 (for D)\nEquation 6: c + e + g + h = 367 (for G)\nEquation 7: d + f + g + h = 562 (for S)\n\nSo, now we have four equations from 2,3,5,6,7.\n\nLet me list all the equations again:\n\n1. a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900\n2. b + c + d = 437\n3. e + f + g = 234\n4. b + e + f + h = 195\n5. c + e + g + h = 367\n6. d + f + g + h = 562\n\nWe have seven equations but eight variables, but we can express a in terms of the others.\n\nFrom equation 1: a = 900 - (b + c + d + e + f + g + h)\n\nFrom equation 2: b + c + d = 437 \u2192 So, a = 900 - (437 + e + f + g + h)\n\nFrom equation 3: e + f + g = 234 \u2192 a = 900 - (437 + 234 + h) \u2192 a = 900 - 671 - h \u2192 a = 229 - h.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, a is 229 - h. But since a can't be negative, h must be \u2264229.\n\nNow, let's try to solve the other equations.\n\nLet me look at equations 4,5,6.\n\nEquation 4: b + e + f + h = 195 \u2192 Let's write this as (b + e + f) = 195 - h.\n\nEquation 5: c + e + g + h = 367 \u2192 (c + e + g) = 367 - h.\n\nEquation 6: d + f + g + h = 562 \u2192 (d + f + g) = 562 - h.\n\nWait, but from equation 3, e + f + g = 234. So, we can use that.\n\nLet me see if I can express some variables in terms of others.\n\nFrom equation 4: b = 195 - h - e - f.\n\nFrom equation 5: c = 367 - h - e - g.\n\nFrom equation 6: d = 562 - h - f - g.\n\nBut from equation 3: e + f + g =234 \u2192 So, g =234 - e - f.\n\nSubstituting g into equation 5 and 6.\n\nFrom equation 5: c = 367 - h - e - (234 - e - f) \u2192 c = 367 - h - e -234 + e + f \u2192 c = (367 -234) - h + f \u2192 c =133 - h + f.\n\nSimilarly, equation 6: d =562 - h - f - (234 - e - f) \u2192 d =562 - h - f -234 + e + f \u2192 d = (562 -234) - h + e \u2192 d=328 - h + e.\n\nNow, from equation 2: b + c + d =437.\n\nWe have expressions for b, c, d in terms of e, f, h.\n\nSo, let's substitute:\n\nb =195 - h - e - f\n\nc =133 - h + f\n\nd=328 - h + e\n\nSo, sum them up:\n\n(195 - h - e - f) + (133 - h + f) + (328 - h + e) =437\n\nSimplify:\n\n195 - h - e - f +133 - h + f +328 - h + e =437\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n195 +133 +328 = 656\n\n-h -h -h = -3h\n\n-e +e =0\n\n-f +f=0\n\nSo, 656 -3h =437\n\nSo, 656 -437 =3h \u2192 219=3h \u2192 h=73.\n\nSo, h is 73. \n\nWait, let me check if this makes sense.\n\nSo, h=73. Then, a=229 - h=229 -73=156.\n\nSo, a=156.\n\nNow, let's see if other variables make sense.\n\nFrom equation 3: e + f + g=234.\n\nFrom equation 4: b + e + f + h=195 \u2192 b + e + f=195 -73=122.\n\nFrom equation 5: c + e + g + h=367 \u2192 c + e + g=367 -73=294.\n\nFrom equation 6: d + f + g + h=562 \u2192 d + f + g=562 -73=489.\n\nWait, but from equation 3, e + f + g=234.\n\nSo, let me compute variables:\n\nFrom equation 4: b=122 - e - f.\n\nFrom equation 5: c=294 - e - g.\n\nFrom equation 6: d=489 - f - g.\n\nBut since e + f + g=234, we can express g=234 - e - f.\n\nSubstituting into c and d:\n\nc=294 - e - (234 - e - f) \u2192 294 -e -234 +e +f \u2192 (294-234) +f \u219260 +f.\n\nSimilarly, d=489 -f - (234 - e -f) \u2192489 -f -234 +e +f \u2192 (489-234) +e \u2192255 +e.\n\nNow, from equation 2: b + c + d=437.\n\nWe have:\n\nb =122 - e - f\n\nc=60 + f\n\nd=255 + e\n\nSo, adding them:\n\n(122 -e -f) + (60 +f) + (255 +e) =437.\n\nSimplify:\n\n122 +60 +255 =437\n\n(-e + e) + (-f +f) =0\n\nSo, 437=437. \n\nWhich is an identity, so it checks out. So, the variables are consistent.\n\nThus, h=73.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Hmm, let me try to parse it out. \n\nSo, there are 900 residents total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. Additionally, some own a diamond ring, some own a set of golf clubs, and others own a garden spade. The numbers are: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade. \n\nNow, the tricky part is the overlap. It says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We're supposed to find out how many own all four\u2014so the ones who have a diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Since everyone owns a candy heart, owning all four is the same as owning the other three and the candy hearts. \n\nWait, actually, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the candy hearts are universal. That means when they talk about owning exactly two or three things, they're only referring to the other three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade). Because the candy hearts are already included in everyone's ownership. \n\nSo, the problem is about three sets: diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and the universal set of candy hearts (C). But since C is universal, every resident has it. So, when considering ownership of exactly two or three things, we're only looking at D, G, S. \n\nWait, but the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the four things are: C, D, G, S. But since C is owned by everyone, the four-way intersection (all four) is just the people who have D, G, S, and C. But since C is universal, the four-way intersection is the same as the three-way intersection of D, G, S. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of people who have all three: D, G, S. Because the candy hearts are already included in all of them.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for all four, but since everyone has C, it's the same as those who have D, G, S. So, we need to find |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|, which is the same as |D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C|, since C is everyone. \n\nSo, how do we find |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|? I remember inclusion-exclusion principles. Let's think about the formula for three sets. \n\nThe inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nBut we don't know |D \u222a G \u222a S|. Wait, but the total number of residents is 900, and everyone has C, which is a bag of candy hearts. So, the maximum number of people who don't have any of D, G, S is 900 minus the number who have at least one of D, G, S. \n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't give us the number of people who have none of D, G, S. Hmm. But maybe we can find |D \u222a G \u222a S| by using the other information given about exactly two and exactly three.\n\nWait, let me think. The total number of people is 900. Each person owns at least C, which is a given. So, some own only C, some own C and one other, some own C and two others, and some own all four.\n\nWait, but the problem states that 437 own exactly two of these things. Wait, but which two? Because the \"things\" include C. Wait, no, the way the problem is phrased: \n\n\"there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\"\n\nWait, the \"these things\" refers to the four: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Because the problem says, \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, the four things are C, D, G, S.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me reread the problem.\n\n\"In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\"\n\nSo, the four things are: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, when it says 437 own exactly two of these things, it includes the candy hearts as one of the four.\n\nBut candy hearts are owned by everyone, so no one owns exactly two without including C. Because if someone owns exactly two things, one of them has to be C, since everyone has C.\n\nWait, that's an important point. Because C is universal, so any ownership count must include C. So, if someone owns exactly two of the four, it must be C plus one other. Similarly, someone owning exactly three must have C plus two others, and someone owning all four has C plus all three.\n\nWait, that changes things. So, the 437 owning exactly two of the four are those who own C and exactly one other item. Similarly, the 234 owning exactly three of the four are those owning C and exactly two others.\n\nSo, the problem is about four items, but since C is universal, the counts are adjusted.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let a = number of people who own exactly C only. (So, they own nothing else.)\n\n- Let b = number of people who own exactly C and D.\n\n- Let c = number of people who own exactly C and G.\n\n- Let d = number of people who own exactly C and S.\n\n- Let e = number of people who own exactly C, D, and G.\n\n- Let f = number of people who own exactly C, D, and S.\n\n- Let g = number of people who own exactly C, G, and S.\n\n- Let h = number of people who own all four: C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, the total number of people is a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900.\n\nNow, the number of people who own exactly two of the four things is b + c + d. Because those are the people who own exactly two: C plus one of D, G, S.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because in the problem statement, exactly two of the four things. So, if someone owns exactly two, they must have two of the four. But since everyone has C, the two must include C and one other. So, exactly two would be C and one more. So, b + c + d = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people who own exactly three of the four things is e + f + g. Because they have C and two others. So, e + f + g = 234.\n\nAnd the number of people who own all four is h. \n\nSo, the problem is asking for h.\n\nSo, our variables are a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, with the following equations:\n\n1. a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900 (total population)\n2. b + c + d = 437 (exactly two)\n3. e + f + g = 234 (exactly three)\n4. We need to find h.\n\nBut we also have the counts of people owning each of the items D, G, S.\n\nThe number of people owning D is 195. That includes:\n\nb (C and D only) + e (C, D, G) + f (C, D, S) + h (all four) = 195.\n\nSimilarly, the number owning G is 367: c + e + g + h = 367.\n\nThe number owning S is 562: d + f + g + h = 562.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nEquation 5: b + e + f + h = 195 (for D)\nEquation 6: c + e + g + h = 367 (for G)\nEquation 7: d + f + g + h = 562 (for S)\n\nSo, now we have four equations from 2,3,5,6,7.\n\nLet me list all the equations again:\n\n1. a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900\n2. b + c + d = 437\n3. e + f + g = 234\n4. b + e + f + h = 195\n5. c + e + g + h = 367\n6. d + f + g + h = 562\n\nWe have seven equations but eight variables, but we can express a in terms of the others.\n\nFrom equation 1: a = 900 - (b + c + d + e + f + g + h)\n\nFrom equation 2: b + c + d = 437 \u2192 So, a = 900 - (437 + e + f + g + h)\n\nFrom equation 3: e + f + g = 234 \u2192 a = 900 - (437 + 234 + h) \u2192 a = 900 - 671 - h \u2192 a = 229 - h.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, a is 229 - h. But since a can't be negative, h must be \u2264229.\n\nNow, let's try to solve the other equations.\n\nLet me look at equations 4,5,6.\n\nEquation 4: b + e + f + h = 195 \u2192 Let's write this as (b + e + f) = 195 - h.\n\nEquation 5: c + e + g + h = 367 \u2192 (c + e + g) = 367 - h.\n\nEquation 6: d + f + g + h = 562 \u2192 (d + f + g) = 562 - h.\n\nWait, but from equation 3, e + f + g = 234. So, we can use that.\n\nLet me see if I can express some variables in terms of others.\n\nFrom equation 4: b = 195 - h - e - f.\n\nFrom equation 5: c = 367 - h - e - g.\n\nFrom equation 6: d = 562 - h - f - g.\n\nBut from equation 3: e + f + g =234 \u2192 So, g =234 - e - f.\n\nSubstituting g into equation 5 and 6.\n\nFrom equation 5: c = 367 - h - e - (234 - e - f) \u2192 c = 367 - h - e -234 + e + f \u2192 c = (367 -234) - h + f \u2192 c =133 - h + f.\n\nSimilarly, equation 6: d =562 - h - f - (234 - e - f) \u2192 d =562 - h - f -234 + e + f \u2192 d = (562 -234) - h + e \u2192 d=328 - h + e.\n\nNow, from equation 2: b + c + d =437.\n\nWe have expressions for b, c, d in terms of e, f, h.\n\nSo, let's substitute:\n\nb =195 - h - e - f\n\nc =133 - h + f\n\nd=328 - h + e\n\nSo, sum them up:\n\n(195 - h - e - f) + (133 - h + f) + (328 - h + e) =437\n\nSimplify:\n\n195 - h - e - f +133 - h + f +328 - h + e =437\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n195 +133 +328 = 656\n\n-h -h -h = -3h\n\n-e +e =0\n\n-f +f=0\n\nSo, 656 -3h =437\n\nSo, 656 -437 =3h \u2192 219=3h \u2192 h=73.\n\nSo, h is 73. \n\nWait, let me check if this makes sense.\n\nSo, h=73. Then, a=229 - h=229 -73=156.\n\nSo, a=156.\n\nNow, let's see if other variables make sense.\n\nFrom equation 3: e + f + g=234.\n\nFrom equation 4: b + e + f + h=195 \u2192 b + e + f=195 -73=122.\n\nFrom equation 5: c + e + g + h=367 \u2192 c + e + g=367 -73=294.\n\nFrom equation 6: d + f + g + h=562 \u2192 d + f + g=562 -73=489.\n\nWait, but from equation 3, e + f + g=234.\n\nSo, let me compute variables:\n\nFrom equation 4: b=122 - e - f.\n\nFrom equation 5: c=294 - e - g.\n\nFrom equation 6: d=489 - f - g.\n\nBut since e + f + g=234, we can express g=234 - e - f.\n\nSubstituting into c and d:\n\nc=294 - e - (234 - e - f) \u2192 294 -e -234 +e +f \u2192 (294-234) +f \u219260 +f.\n\nSimilarly, d=489 -f - (234 - e -f) \u2192489 -f -234 +e +f \u2192 (489-234) +e \u2192255 +e.\n\nNow, from equation 2: b + c + d=437.\n\nWe have:\n\nb =122 - e - f\n\nc=60 + f\n\nd=255 + e\n\nSo, adding them:\n\n(122 -e -f) + (60 +f) + (255 +e) =437.\n\nSimplify:\n\n122 +60 +255 =437\n\n(-e + e) + (-f +f) =0\n\nSo, 437=437. \n\nWhich is an identity, so it checks out. So, the variables are consistent.\n\nThus, h=73.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the given data step by step.\n\nWe denote:\n- \\( a \\) = number of people who own only candy hearts (C).\n- \\( b, c, d \\) = number of people who own exactly two items: C and one of D, G, or S.\n- \\( e, f, g \\) = number of people who own exactly three items: C and two of D, G, or S.\n- \\( h \\) = number of people who own all four items: C, D, G, and S.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says there are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. Additionally, some own a diamond ring, some own a set of golf clubs, and some own a garden spade. The numbers given are: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade. Then, it mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four things\u2014so the candy hearts plus the other three items.\n\nHmm, okay. I think this is a problem involving set theory and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the size of the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, we're given some specific numbers about exactly two and exactly three items. So I think I'll need to use that information somehow. Let me jot down what I know:\n\n- Total residents (T) = 900\n- Number owning a diamond ring (D) = 195\n- Number owning golf clubs (G) = 367\n- Number owning garden spade (S) = 562\n- Number owning exactly two items (E2) = 437\n- Number owning exactly three items (E3) = 234\n- We need to find the number owning all four items (E4).\n\nWait, but all residents own at least the candy hearts. So every resident owns at least one thing\u2014candy hearts. So maybe the four items are considered, with candy hearts being one of them. So each resident owns at least one item, which is the candy hearts.\n\nSo perhaps I should model this as four sets: D, G, S, and C (for candy hearts). But since everyone owns C, C is the universal set here. So all the other sets (D, G, S) are subsets of C.\n\nBut since the problem is about four items, and everyone has at least C, the problem is about the overlaps among D, G, S, and C. But since C is universal, maybe we can ignore it in our calculations except when considering the overlaps.\n\nWait, but the problem states that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So each resident is in C. So when we talk about the number owning exactly two things, those two things must include C. Or maybe not? Because the problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts,\" so every resident owns C. So when it talks about someone owning exactly two things, that would be C plus one other, or maybe two others? Wait, no\u2014if someone owns exactly two things, they could be C plus another item, or perhaps two other items? But wait, no, because everyone must own C.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So everyone owns C. So when we talk about the number of residents who own exactly two things, that includes C. So for example, a resident who owns exactly two things would be someone who owns C and one other item, right? Because they can't own two other items without C since C is already owned by everyone.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if someone owns exactly two things, it's possible they have C and another item. But if someone owns exactly two things, it's C plus one other, because they can't have two other items without C because C is universal. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps the way to think about it is that each resident owns at least C, but they might own more. So when the problem says someone owns exactly two things, that includes C and one other. Similarly, exactly three would include C and two others, and exactly four would be C plus all three others.\n\nWait, so the four things are C, D, G, S. So each resident owns at least C, but can own any combination of D, G, S along with C.\n\nSo the problem gives:\n\n- Exactly two things: 437. Since everyone has C, that would be C plus one of D, G, S. So each of these 437 people has exactly two things: C and one other.\n\n- Exactly three things: 234. That would be C plus two others. So each of these 234 people has C, and two of D, G, S.\n\n- Exactly four things: E4, which is what we need to find. That would be C plus all three: D, G, S. So E4 is the number of people owning all four.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Because when we talk about exactly two things, it's possible that someone owns two of D, G, S without owning C. But wait, no, because the problem says every resident owns C. So that's not possible. So in this problem, every resident has C, so when they own exactly two things, it's C plus one other. So exactly two is C plus one of D, G, S.\n\nSimilarly, exactly three things would be C plus two of D, G, S, and exactly four would be C plus all three.\n\nSo, the problem is to find E4, the number of residents owning all four items.\n\nSo let's model this.\n\nLet me think in terms of inclusion-exclusion. The total number of residents is 900, and each owns at least C. So the total can be broken down into:\n\n- Those owning exactly one thing: which would be only C, because everyone has C. Wait, but no, because if someone owns exactly one thing, it's just C. But the problem doesn't mention how many own exactly one thing. Hmm, perhaps that's part of the problem.\n\nWait, but the problem gives us exactly two, exactly three, and asks for exactly four. So maybe the rest are exactly one. So the total is:\n\nNumber owning exactly one + exactly two + exactly three + exactly four = 900.\n\nSo, let me define:\n\nE1: number of people owning exactly one thing (only C)\nE2: 437 (C + one other)\nE3: 234 (C + two others)\nE4: ?\n\nSo, E1 + E2 + E3 + E4 = 900.\n\nSo, E1 = 900 - (E2 + E3 + E4) = 900 - (437 + 234 + E4) = 900 - 671 - E4 = 229 - E4.\n\nBut perhaps that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can use inclusion-exclusion for the other three sets (D, G, S), considering that C is already included in all of them.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the inclusion-exclusion principle for the three sets D, G, S, but considering that every resident has at least C. So the total number of people owning D, G, or S is equal to the sum of each individual set minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the triple intersection.\n\nWait, but let me think. Let me denote the number of people owning all three of D, G, S as x. That's E4, because if someone owns all three, they also own C, so they own all four.\n\nWait, but the problem says that 234 people own exactly three things. So exactly three would be C plus two of D, G, S. So the number of people owning exactly three things is 234, which is the sum of the people owning C, D, G; C, D, S; and C, G, S.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this with Venn diagrams. Let me consider the three sets D, G, S, each of which is a subset of C. So the Venn diagram would have three circles for D, G, S, and each represents the people who own those items in addition to C.\n\nWait, so let me define:\n\na = number of people owning only D (so only C and D)\nb = number owning only G (C and G)\nc = number owning only S (C and S)\nd = number owning D and G but not S (so C, D, G)\ne = number owning D and S but not G (C, D, S)\nf = number owning G and S but not D (C, G, S)\ng = number owning D, G, and S (so C, D, G, S) \u2192 this is E4, which is what we're looking for.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, exactly two things are 437. Since each of these people owns C plus one other, that would be a + b + c. Because d, e, f would be people owning three things (C plus two others). So, a + b + c = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three things is d + e + f = 234.\n\nAnd the number owning all four things is g = E4.\n\nAdditionally, the number of people owning only D is a, only G is b, only S is c. Then, the people owning two items without the third are d, e, f. And g is those owning all three.\n\nSo, the total number of people owning D is a + d + e + g = 195.\n\nSimilarly, total owning G is b + d + f + g = 367.\n\nTotal owning S is c + e + f + g = 562.\n\nSo, let's write these equations.\n\n1. a + b + c = 437 (exactly two)\n2. d + e + f = 234 (exactly three)\n3. a + d + e + g = 195 (total D)\n4. b + d + f + g = 367 (total G)\n5. c + e + f + g = 562 (total S)\n6. The total residents: (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) + g + E1 = 900.\n\nBut E1 is the number of people owning only C, which is a + b + c + d + e + f + g + E1 = 900?\n\nWait, no. Wait, E1 is the number of people owning exactly one thing, which is only C. So the total is:\n\nE1 (only C) + (a + b + c) (exactly two) + (d + e + f) (exactly three) + g (exactly four) = 900.\n\nSo, E1 + 437 + 234 + g = 900 \u2192 E1 + g = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo E1 + g = 229. Hmm, but we don't know E1 or g yet.\n\nBut perhaps we can find another equation using the inclusion-exclusion for D, G, S.\n\nWait, the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets D, G, S would be:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nBut wait, in this case, |D| is the number of people owning D, which includes those who own D and possibly other items. So |D| = a + d + e + g = 195.\n\nSimilarly, |G| = b + d + f + g = 367.\n\n|S| = c + e + f + g = 562.\n\n|D \u2229 G| is the number of people owning both D and G, which is d + g.\n\nSimilarly, |D \u2229 S| is e + g, and |G \u2229 S| is f + g.\n\nAnd |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| is g.\n\nSo, plugging into inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|\n\n= 195 + 367 + 562 - (d + g) - (e + g) - (f + g) + g.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 195 + 367 + 562 - d - e - f - 3g + g.\n\n= (195 + 367 + 562) - (d + e + f) - 2g.\n\nCompute 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSo, 1124 - (d + e + f) - 2g.\n\nBut from equation 2, we know that d + e + f = 234.\n\nSo, |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 1124 - 234 - 2g = 890 - 2g.\n\nBut wait, |D \u222a G \u222a S| is the number of people who own at least one of D, G, S. But since everyone owns C, and the other items are D, G, S, the union D \u222a G \u222a S counts all residents who own at least one of D, G, or S. But since everyone owns C, some people might not own any of D, G, S, which would be the people owning only C, which is E1.\n\nSo, the number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is |D \u222a G \u222a S| = total residents - E1.\n\nSo, |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - E1.\n\nBut earlier, we found |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 890 - 2g.\n\nSo, 900 - E1 = 890 - 2g \u2192 E1 = 900 - (890 - 2g) = 10 + 2g.\n\nBut from equation 6, we had E1 + g = 229.\n\nSo, substituting E1 = 10 + 2g into E1 + g = 229:\n\n10 + 2g + g = 229 \u2192 10 + 3g = 229 \u2192 3g = 219 \u2192 g = 73.\n\nSo, g is 73. That is, 73 people own all four items.\n\nWait, but let me check this calculation again to make sure.\n\nWait, |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 1124 - 234 - 2g = 890 - 2g.\n\nAnd since |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - E1.\n\nSo 900 - E1 = 890 - 2g \u2192 E1 = 900 - 890 + 2g \u2192 E1 = 10 + 2g.\n\nBut from equation 6, E1 + g = 229.\n\nSo substituting E1 = 10 + 2g into that:\n\n10 + 2g + g = 229 \u2192 10 + 3g = 229 \u2192 3g = 219 \u2192 g = 73.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of residents owning all four items is 73.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure all the numbers add up.\n\nSo, E1 = 10 + 2g = 10 + 2*73 = 10 + 146 = 156.\n\nSo, E1 is 156, E2 is 437, E3 is 234, E4 is 73.\n\nAdding them up: 156 + 437 = 593; 593 + 234 = 827; 827 + 73 = 900. Perfect, that adds up to 900.\n\nNow, let's check the totals for D, G, S.\n\nFor D: a + d + e + g = 195.\n\nWe have g =73, but we don't know a, d, e yet.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\nWe have:\n\na + b + c = 437.\n\nd + e + f = 234.\n\nFrom the totals:\n\nFor D: a + d + e + g = 195 \u2192 a + d + e = 195 - 73 = 122.\n\nFor G: b + d + f + g = 367 \u2192 b + d + f = 367 - 73 = 294.\n\nFor S: c + e + f + g = 562 \u2192 c + e + f = 562 - 73 = 489.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1. a + b + c = 437.\n\n2. d + e + f = 234.\n\n3. a + d + e = 122.\n\n4. b + d + f = 294.\n\n5. c + e + f = 489.\n\nLet me see if I can solve for a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\nFrom equation 3: a = 122 - d - e.\n\nFrom equation 4: b = 294 - d - f.\n\nFrom equation 5: c = 489 - e - f.\n\nNow, substitute a, b, c into equation 1:\n\n(122 - d - e) + (294 - d - f) + (489 - e - f) = 437.\n\nSimplify:\n\n122 + 294 + 489 - d - e - d - f - e - f = 437.\n\nAdding up the constants: 122 + 294 = 416; 416 + 489 = 905.\n\nNow, combining like terms:\n\n905 - (2d + 2e + 2f) = 437.\n\nSo, 2d + 2e + 2f = 905 - 437 = 468 \u2192 d + e + f = 234.\n\nWhich matches equation 2, so that's consistent. So the equations are consistent, but we might not have unique values for each variable, but since the problem only asks for E4, which is 73, perhaps that's sufficient.\n\nSo, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of residents in Aimeville who own all four items: a bag of candy hearts, a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, and a garden spade. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given data, we find that 73 residents own all four items.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{73}",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says there are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. Additionally, some own a diamond ring, some own a set of golf clubs, and some own a garden spade. The numbers given are: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade. Then, it mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four things\u2014so the candy hearts plus the other three items.\n\nHmm, okay. I think this is a problem involving set theory and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the size of the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, we're given some specific numbers about exactly two and exactly three items. So I think I'll need to use that information somehow. Let me jot down what I know:\n\n- Total residents (T) = 900\n- Number owning a diamond ring (D) = 195\n- Number owning golf clubs (G) = 367\n- Number owning garden spade (S) = 562\n- Number owning exactly two items (E2) = 437\n- Number owning exactly three items (E3) = 234\n- We need to find the number owning all four items (E4).\n\nWait, but all residents own at least the candy hearts. So every resident owns at least one thing\u2014candy hearts. So maybe the four items are considered, with candy hearts being one of them. So each resident owns at least one item, which is the candy hearts.\n\nSo perhaps I should model this as four sets: D, G, S, and C (for candy hearts). But since everyone owns C, C is the universal set here. So all the other sets (D, G, S) are subsets of C.\n\nBut since the problem is about four items, and everyone has at least C, the problem is about the overlaps among D, G, S, and C. But since C is universal, maybe we can ignore it in our calculations except when considering the overlaps.\n\nWait, but the problem states that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So each resident is in C. So when we talk about the number owning exactly two things, those two things must include C. Or maybe not? Because the problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts,\" so every resident owns C. So when it talks about someone owning exactly two things, that would be C plus one other, or maybe two others? Wait, no\u2014if someone owns exactly two things, they could be C plus another item, or perhaps two other items? But wait, no, because everyone must own C.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So everyone owns C. So when we talk about the number of residents who own exactly two things, that includes C. So for example, a resident who owns exactly two things would be someone who owns C and one other item, right? Because they can't own two other items without C since C is already owned by everyone.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if someone owns exactly two things, it's possible they have C and another item. But if someone owns exactly two things, it's C plus one other, because they can't have two other items without C because C is universal. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps the way to think about it is that each resident owns at least C, but they might own more. So when the problem says someone owns exactly two things, that includes C and one other. Similarly, exactly three would include C and two others, and exactly four would be C plus all three others.\n\nWait, so the four things are C, D, G, S. So each resident owns at least C, but can own any combination of D, G, S along with C.\n\nSo the problem gives:\n\n- Exactly two things: 437. Since everyone has C, that would be C plus one of D, G, S. So each of these 437 people has exactly two things: C and one other.\n\n- Exactly three things: 234. That would be C plus two others. So each of these 234 people has C, and two of D, G, S.\n\n- Exactly four things: E4, which is what we need to find. That would be C plus all three: D, G, S. So E4 is the number of people owning all four.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Because when we talk about exactly two things, it's possible that someone owns two of D, G, S without owning C. But wait, no, because the problem says every resident owns C. So that's not possible. So in this problem, every resident has C, so when they own exactly two things, it's C plus one other. So exactly two is C plus one of D, G, S.\n\nSimilarly, exactly three things would be C plus two of D, G, S, and exactly four would be C plus all three.\n\nSo, the problem is to find E4, the number of residents owning all four items.\n\nSo let's model this.\n\nLet me think in terms of inclusion-exclusion. The total number of residents is 900, and each owns at least C. So the total can be broken down into:\n\n- Those owning exactly one thing: which would be only C, because everyone has C. Wait, but no, because if someone owns exactly one thing, it's just C. But the problem doesn't mention how many own exactly one thing. Hmm, perhaps that's part of the problem.\n\nWait, but the problem gives us exactly two, exactly three, and asks for exactly four. So maybe the rest are exactly one. So the total is:\n\nNumber owning exactly one + exactly two + exactly three + exactly four = 900.\n\nSo, let me define:\n\nE1: number of people owning exactly one thing (only C)\nE2: 437 (C + one other)\nE3: 234 (C + two others)\nE4: ?\n\nSo, E1 + E2 + E3 + E4 = 900.\n\nSo, E1 = 900 - (E2 + E3 + E4) = 900 - (437 + 234 + E4) = 900 - 671 - E4 = 229 - E4.\n\nBut perhaps that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can use inclusion-exclusion for the other three sets (D, G, S), considering that C is already included in all of them.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the inclusion-exclusion principle for the three sets D, G, S, but considering that every resident has at least C. So the total number of people owning D, G, or S is equal to the sum of each individual set minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the triple intersection.\n\nWait, but let me think. Let me denote the number of people owning all three of D, G, S as x. That's E4, because if someone owns all three, they also own C, so they own all four.\n\nWait, but the problem says that 234 people own exactly three things. So exactly three would be C plus two of D, G, S. So the number of people owning exactly three things is 234, which is the sum of the people owning C, D, G; C, D, S; and C, G, S.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this with Venn diagrams. Let me consider the three sets D, G, S, each of which is a subset of C. So the Venn diagram would have three circles for D, G, S, and each represents the people who own those items in addition to C.\n\nWait, so let me define:\n\na = number of people owning only D (so only C and D)\nb = number owning only G (C and G)\nc = number owning only S (C and S)\nd = number owning D and G but not S (so C, D, G)\ne = number owning D and S but not G (C, D, S)\nf = number owning G and S but not D (C, G, S)\ng = number owning D, G, and S (so C, D, G, S) \u2192 this is E4, which is what we're looking for.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, exactly two things are 437. Since each of these people owns C plus one other, that would be a + b + c. Because d, e, f would be people owning three things (C plus two others). So, a + b + c = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three things is d + e + f = 234.\n\nAnd the number owning all four things is g = E4.\n\nAdditionally, the number of people owning only D is a, only G is b, only S is c. Then, the people owning two items without the third are d, e, f. And g is those owning all three.\n\nSo, the total number of people owning D is a + d + e + g = 195.\n\nSimilarly, total owning G is b + d + f + g = 367.\n\nTotal owning S is c + e + f + g = 562.\n\nSo, let's write these equations.\n\n1. a + b + c = 437 (exactly two)\n2. d + e + f = 234 (exactly three)\n3. a + d + e + g = 195 (total D)\n4. b + d + f + g = 367 (total G)\n5. c + e + f + g = 562 (total S)\n6. The total residents: (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) + g + E1 = 900.\n\nBut E1 is the number of people owning only C, which is a + b + c + d + e + f + g + E1 = 900?\n\nWait, no. Wait, E1 is the number of people owning exactly one thing, which is only C. So the total is:\n\nE1 (only C) + (a + b + c) (exactly two) + (d + e + f) (exactly three) + g (exactly four) = 900.\n\nSo, E1 + 437 + 234 + g = 900 \u2192 E1 + g = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo E1 + g = 229. Hmm, but we don't know E1 or g yet.\n\nBut perhaps we can find another equation using the inclusion-exclusion for D, G, S.\n\nWait, the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets D, G, S would be:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nBut wait, in this case, |D| is the number of people owning D, which includes those who own D and possibly other items. So |D| = a + d + e + g = 195.\n\nSimilarly, |G| = b + d + f + g = 367.\n\n|S| = c + e + f + g = 562.\n\n|D \u2229 G| is the number of people owning both D and G, which is d + g.\n\nSimilarly, |D \u2229 S| is e + g, and |G \u2229 S| is f + g.\n\nAnd |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| is g.\n\nSo, plugging into inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|\n\n= 195 + 367 + 562 - (d + g) - (e + g) - (f + g) + g.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 195 + 367 + 562 - d - e - f - 3g + g.\n\n= (195 + 367 + 562) - (d + e + f) - 2g.\n\nCompute 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSo, 1124 - (d + e + f) - 2g.\n\nBut from equation 2, we know that d + e + f = 234.\n\nSo, |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 1124 - 234 - 2g = 890 - 2g.\n\nBut wait, |D \u222a G \u222a S| is the number of people who own at least one of D, G, S. But since everyone owns C, and the other items are D, G, S, the union D \u222a G \u222a S counts all residents who own at least one of D, G, or S. But since everyone owns C, some people might not own any of D, G, S, which would be the people owning only C, which is E1.\n\nSo, the number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is |D \u222a G \u222a S| = total residents - E1.\n\nSo, |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - E1.\n\nBut earlier, we found |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 890 - 2g.\n\nSo, 900 - E1 = 890 - 2g \u2192 E1 = 900 - (890 - 2g) = 10 + 2g.\n\nBut from equation 6, we had E1 + g = 229.\n\nSo, substituting E1 = 10 + 2g into E1 + g = 229:\n\n10 + 2g + g = 229 \u2192 10 + 3g = 229 \u2192 3g = 219 \u2192 g = 73.\n\nSo, g is 73. That is, 73 people own all four items.\n\nWait, but let me check this calculation again to make sure.\n\nWait, |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 1124 - 234 - 2g = 890 - 2g.\n\nAnd since |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - E1.\n\nSo 900 - E1 = 890 - 2g \u2192 E1 = 900 - 890 + 2g \u2192 E1 = 10 + 2g.\n\nBut from equation 6, E1 + g = 229.\n\nSo substituting E1 = 10 + 2g into that:\n\n10 + 2g + g = 229 \u2192 10 + 3g = 229 \u2192 3g = 219 \u2192 g = 73.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of residents owning all four items is 73.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure all the numbers add up.\n\nSo, E1 = 10 + 2g = 10 + 2*73 = 10 + 146 = 156.\n\nSo, E1 is 156, E2 is 437, E3 is 234, E4 is 73.\n\nAdding them up: 156 + 437 = 593; 593 + 234 = 827; 827 + 73 = 900. Perfect, that adds up to 900.\n\nNow, let's check the totals for D, G, S.\n\nFor D: a + d + e + g = 195.\n\nWe have g =73, but we don't know a, d, e yet.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\nWe have:\n\na + b + c = 437.\n\nd + e + f = 234.\n\nFrom the totals:\n\nFor D: a + d + e + g = 195 \u2192 a + d + e = 195 - 73 = 122.\n\nFor G: b + d + f + g = 367 \u2192 b + d + f = 367 - 73 = 294.\n\nFor S: c + e + f + g = 562 \u2192 c + e + f = 562 - 73 = 489.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1. a + b + c = 437.\n\n2. d + e + f = 234.\n\n3. a + d + e = 122.\n\n4. b + d + f = 294.\n\n5. c + e + f = 489.\n\nLet me see if I can solve for a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\nFrom equation 3: a = 122 - d - e.\n\nFrom equation 4: b = 294 - d - f.\n\nFrom equation 5: c = 489 - e - f.\n\nNow, substitute a, b, c into equation 1:\n\n(122 - d - e) + (294 - d - f) + (489 - e - f) = 437.\n\nSimplify:\n\n122 + 294 + 489 - d - e - d - f - e - f = 437.\n\nAdding up the constants: 122 + 294 = 416; 416 + 489 = 905.\n\nNow, combining like terms:\n\n905 - (2d + 2e + 2f) = 437.\n\nSo, 2d + 2e + 2f = 905 - 437 = 468 \u2192 d + e + f = 234.\n\nWhich matches equation 2, so that's consistent. So the equations are consistent, but we might not have unique values for each variable, but since the problem only asks for E4, which is 73, perhaps that's sufficient.\n\nSo, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of residents in Aimeville who own all four items: a bag of candy hearts, a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, and a garden spade. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given data, we find that 73 residents own all four items.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{73}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem about residents in Aimeville and what they own. Hmm, let me read it again.\n\nThere are 900 residents total. Out of these, 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade, and everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. So, four items in total: diamond ring (let's call this D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). Wait, but the candy hearts are owned by all 900, right? So C is universal, everyone has it.\n\nNow, the problem says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. I need to find how many own all four. So, the question is about the intersection of all four sets.\n\nI remember that in set theory, the principle of inclusion-exclusion is used for such problems. But since the problem specifies exactly two and exactly three, maybe I can use that to find the overlaps.\n\nLet me think. The standard inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets would involve the sizes of each set, the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, three-set intersections, and so on. But here, I have some information about exactly two and exactly three. So maybe I can approach it differently.\n\nWait, let me recall. The formula for the union of four sets is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229S| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut in this case, everyone owns at least the candy hearts, so the union is 900. Because C is universal, so |D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = 900.\n\nBut I don't know all the pairwise intersections or the triple intersections. Hmm, maybe that's not the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this using the concept of exactly two and exactly three. Let me think.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- a = number of people owning exactly two of the four items.\n\n- b = number owning exactly three.\n\n- c = number owning all four.\n\nBut wait, since everyone owns at least C, the four items are D, G, S, and C, which is always present. So, actually, when considering \"exactly two\", it's the two among D, G, S, because C is already included in everyone. So, for example, someone who owns exactly two items could be owning D and G and C, right? Wait, no, because they own exactly two, but C is already one. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. Each resident owns at least C. So, when they say a resident owns exactly two of these things, they mean exactly two in total, including C. So, for example, someone could own C and D, or C and G, etc. So, \"exactly two\" includes C plus one other. Similarly, \"exactly three\" would be C plus two others, and \"all four\" is C plus all three.\n\nSo, the 437 who own exactly two items are those who own C and exactly one other item. Similarly, the 234 who own exactly three items are those who own C and exactly two others, and the ones who own all four are C plus all three others.\n\nSo, maybe I can model this using the inclusion-exclusion for exactly k sets. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, let's denote the number of people owning exactly two of the four items as 437. Since C is always owned, these 437 must be the number of people who own exactly one other item along with C. So, for example, people owning C and D but nothing else, C and G but nothing else, etc.\n\nSimilarly, the 234 who own exactly three items must be those who own C and two others, like C, D, G, but not S, etc.\n\nAnd the ones who own all four items are C, D, G, S.\n\nWait, but how does this help me? Maybe I can relate this to the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nLet me think about the inclusion-exclusion formula again, but focusing on the counts of people owning exactly certain numbers of items.\n\nI remember that in such problems, the total number of people is equal to the sum of people owning exactly 1, exactly 2, exactly 3, exactly 4 items. But wait, no. Because each person owns at least C, so the minimum they can own is 1 (C). So, the total number of people is the sum of exactly 1, exactly 2, exactly 3, exactly 4.\n\nWait, but the problem says that all 900 own a bag of candy hearts, so the minimum is 1 (C). So, the total is:\n\nTotal = exactly 1 + exactly 2 + exactly 3 + exactly 4.\n\nBut wait, in the problem, it's given that 437 own exactly two of the things, and 234 own exactly three. So, we have exactly 2 = 437, exactly 3 = 234. We need to find exactly 4.\n\nBut wait, do we know exactly 1? Because the problem doesn't state it. Hmm, but perhaps we can compute it.\n\nWait, let me think again. The total is 900. So:\n\nTotal = exactly 1 + exactly 2 + exactly 3 + exactly 4.\n\nBut we don't know exactly 1, exactly 4. So, we have:\n\n900 = exactly 1 + 437 + 234 + exactly 4.\n\nSo, 900 = exactly 1 + 671 + exactly 4.\n\nThus, exactly 1 + exactly 4 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nBut we don't know exactly 1 or exactly 4 individually.\n\nHmm, so maybe I need another equation. Let's think about the total number of items owned.\n\nEach resident owns at least C, so each resident has at least one item. Let me think about the total number of items.\n\nWait, the sum of the sizes of each set is equal to the sum over exactly k items multiplied by k, minus the overlaps? Wait, perhaps that's a different approach.\n\nWait, the total number of items owned across all residents would be:\n\nSum = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C|.\n\nBut since everyone owns C, |C|=900.\n\nSo, Sum = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900.\n\nLet me compute that: 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124, plus 900 is 2024.\n\nSo, total items owned is 2024.\n\nBut each resident owns at least one item, but the number of items per resident varies. So, the sum of all items is equal to the sum over each resident of the number of items they own.\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nSum = \u03a3 (number of items per resident) = exactly1 *1 + exactly2 *2 + exactly3 *3 + exactly4 *4.\n\nWe know exactly2 = 437, exactly3 = 234, and exactly4 = c (which we need to find). Exactly1 is 229 - c, from the earlier equation: exactly1 + exactly4 = 229.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nSum = (229 - c)*1 + 437*2 + 234*3 + c*4.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n= (229 - c) + 874 + 702 + 4c.\n\nSimplify:\n\n229 - c + 874 = 1103 - c.\n\n1103 - c + 702 = 1805 - c.\n\n1805 - c + 4c = 1805 + 3c.\n\nWe know the total Sum is 2024, so:\n\n1805 + 3c = 2024.\n\nSubtract 1805 from both sides:\n\n3c = 2024 - 1805 = 219.\n\nSo, 3c = 219 \u2192 c = 73.\n\nWait, so exactly4 is 73. Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n\nLet me just check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSum of items: 195 + 367 + 562 + 900.\n\n195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124; 1124 + 900 = 2024. That's correct.\n\nThen, the sum of items is also equal to exactly1*1 + exactly2*2 + exactly3*3 + exactly4*4.\n\nWe know exactly2=437, exactly3=234.\n\nFrom the total residents: exactly1 + exactly2 + exactly3 + exactly4 = 900.\n\nSo, exactly1 = 900 - (437 + 234 + exactly4) = 900 - 671 - exactly4 = 229 - exactly4.\n\nThus, exactly1 = 229 - c, where c is exactly4.\n\nThen, substituting into the sum equation:\n\n(229 - c)*1 + 437*2 + 234*3 + c*4 = 2024.\n\nCalculations:\n\n229 - c + 874 + 702 + 4c.\n\nAdding 229 + 874 = 1103.\n\n1103 + 702 = 1805.\n\nNow, 1805 - c + 4c = 1805 + 3c.\n\nSet equal to 2024: 1805 + 3c = 2024 \u2192 3c = 219 \u2192 c = 73.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the given data.

Out of these, 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade, and everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. So, four items in total: diamond ring (let's call this D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). Wait, but the candy hearts are owned by all 900, right? So C is universal, everyone has it.\n\nNow, the problem says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. I need to find how many own all four.

So, the sum of all items is equal to the sum over each resident of the number of items they own.\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nSum = \u03a3 (number of items per resident) = exactly1 *1 + exactly2 *2 + exactly3 *3 + exactly4 *4.\n\nWe know exactly2 = 437, exactly3 = 234, and exactly4 = c (which we need to find). Exactly1 is 229 - c, from the earlier equation: exactly1 + exactly4 = 229.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nSum = (229 - c)*1 + 437*2 + 234*3 + c*4.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n= (229 - c) + 874 + 702 + 4c.\n\nSimplify:\n\n229 - c + 874 = 1103 - c.\n\n1103 - c + 702 = 1805 - c.\n\n1805 - c + 4c = 1805 + 3c.\n\nWe know the total Sum is 2024, so:\n\n1805 + 3c = 2024.\n\nSubtract 1805 from both sides:\n\n3c = 2024 - 1805 = 219.\n\nSo, 3c = 219 \u2192 c = 73.\n\nWait, so exactly4 is 73. Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n\nLet me just check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSum of items: 195 + 367 + 562 + 900.\n\n195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124; 1124 + 900 = 2024. That's correct.\n\nThen, the sum of items is also equal to exactly1*1 + exactly2*2 + exactly3*3 + exactly4*4.\n\nWe know exactly2=437, exactly3=234.\n\nFrom the total residents: exactly1 + exactly2 + exactly3 + exactly4 = 900.\n\nSo, exactly1 = 900 - (437 + 234 + exactly4) = 900 - 671 - exactly4 = 229 - exactly4.\n\nThus, exactly1 = 229 - c, where c is exactly4.\n\nThen, substituting into the sum equation:\n\n(229 - c)*1 + 437*2 + 234*3 + c*4 = 2024.\n\nCalculations:\n\n229 - c + 874 + 702 + 4c.\n\nAdding 229 + 874 = 1103.\n\n1103 + 702 = 1805.\n\nNow, 1805 - c + 4c = 1805 + 3c.\n\nSet equal to 2024: 1805 + 3c = 2024 \u2192 3c = 219 \u2192 c = 73.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the given data. We know the total number of residents is 900, and each resident owns at least a bag of candy hearts (C). The problem states that 437 residents own exactly two items, and 234 own exactly three items. We need to find how many own all four items.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s denote:\n- \\( a \\) = number of residents owning exactly two items (given as 437),\n- \\( b \\) = number of residents owning exactly three items (given as 234),\n- \\( c \\) = number of residents owning all four items (to be determined),\n- \\( d \\) = number of residents owning exactly one item.\n\nSince every resident owns at least C, the total number of residents is the sum of those owning exactly one, two, three, or four items:\n\\[\nd + a + b + c = 900.\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\nd + 437 + 234 + c = 900 \\implies d + c = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229.\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of items owned by all residents. Each resident owns at least one item, so the total number of items is:\n\\[\n|D| + |G| + |S| + |C| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024.\n\\]\n\nThe total number of items can also be expressed as:\n\\[\nd \\cdot 1 + a \\cdot 2 + b \\cdot 3 + c \\cdot 4 = 2024.\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\nd \\cdot 1 + 437 \\cdot 2 + 234 \\cdot 3 + c \\cdot 4 = 2024.\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\nd + 874 + 702 + 4c = 2024 \\implies d + 4c = 2024 - 874 - 702 = 448.\n\\]\n\nWe now have two equations:\n1. \\( d + c = 229 \\),\n2. \\( d + 4c = 448 \\).\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\\[\n(d + 4c) - (d + c) = 448 - 229 \\implies 3c = 219 \\implies c = 73.\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four items is **73**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{73}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Hmm, let me try to parse it. There are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns at least one of these four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, or a bag of candy hearts. Wait, no, actually, the problem says each owns a bag of candy hearts. So, actually, everyone owns the candy hearts. So that's one thing that's universal.\n\nThen, the other three items\u2014diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade\u2014are owned by some subset of the population. Let me jot down the numbers:\n\n- Diamond rings: 195 owners\n- Golf clubs: 367 owners\n- Garden spades: 562 owners\n- Candy hearts: 900 owners (since everyone has them)\n\nAlso, there are some overlaps:\n\n- 437 residents own exactly two of these things.\n- 234 residents own exactly three of these things.\n\nAnd we need to find the number of residents who own all four things, which includes the candy hearts and the other three. Wait, but since everyone has the candy hearts, owning all four is the same as owning the other three and the candy hearts, which is the same as owning all three of the other items. Or maybe not? Let me think.\n\nSo, in set terms, we can model this with the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Since each person owns at least the candy hearts, the total number of residents is 900. The other three items are optional, but the candy hearts are mandatory. So, maybe I can model the problem by considering the other three items as the variables and the candy hearts as a given.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let A be the set of owners of diamond rings.\n- Let B be the set of owners of golf clubs.\n- Let C be the set of owners of garden spades.\n- Let D be the set of owners of candy hearts. But since everyone owns D, D is the universal set here.\n\nSo, we're looking for |A \u2229 B \u2229 C \u2229 D|, but since D includes everyone, this is the same as |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|. So, the number we're looking for is the number of people who own all three of A, B, and C.\n\nBut wait, the problem says 234 residents own exactly three of these things. But since everyone owns D (candy hearts), owning exactly three would mean they own three of A, B, C, and D. So, actually, the 234 people own all four. Wait, no, no\u2014let me clarify.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\" Since D is one of the four things, and everyone owns D, owning exactly two would mean owning D plus one other, and owning exactly three would mean owning D plus two others. So, the 234 residents who own exactly three of the four things actually own all four, because they have D plus two others. Wait, no\u2014exactly three would be D plus two others, so they have three in total, not four. Because if they have D plus two others, that's three. So, they don't have all four, they have three. So, the 234 residents have exactly three: D plus two of A, B, C. And the 437 have exactly two: D plus one of A, B, C.\n\nSo, the people who own all four (A, B, C, D) are not included in the 234 who own exactly three. So, our target is to find the number of people in A \u2229 B \u2229 C \u2229 D, which is the same as |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|, because D is universal.\n\nSo, how do we find |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|? Let's recall inclusion-exclusion for three sets. The formula for the union of A, B, and C is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\nBut we don't know |A \u222a B \u222a C| because the problem doesn't directly tell us. Wait, but since everyone owns D, the total number of residents is 900. So, the number of people who own at least one of A, B, or C is equal to 900 minus the number of people who own only D. Wait, but the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so they might own only D, or D plus some combination.\n\nWait, but the problem also states that there are 437 who own exactly two things and 234 who own exactly three things. So, let's see, the residents can be categorized based on how many of the four items they own. But since D is always owned, the number of items they own is 1 to 4.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Since D is mandatory, the number of additional items they can own is 0, 1, 2, or 3. So, the possible counts are:\n\n- Exactly 1 item: only D.\n- Exactly 2 items: D plus one more (A, B, or C).\n- Exactly 3 items: D plus two more.\n- Exactly 4 items: D plus all three.\n\nSo, the problem says that 437 own exactly two of the four things. But since D is one of them, exactly two would mean D plus one of A, B, C. Similarly, exactly three would mean D plus two of A, B, C. And exactly four would mean D plus all three of A, B, C.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\n- Let x be the number of people who own exactly D (only one item).\n- Let y be the number of people who own exactly D and one other (exactly two items). The problem states this is 437.\n- Let z be the number of people who own exactly D and two others (exactly three items). The problem states this is 234.\n- Let w be the number of people who own all four items (D and A, B, C). We need to find this.\n\nSo, the total number of residents is x + y + z + w = 900.\n\nWe also know that y = 437, z = 234, so x + 437 + 234 + w = 900. So, x + w = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229. So, x + w = 229.\n\nNow, we can also compute the total number of people who own at least one of A, B, or C. Since D is universal, the number of people who own A, B, or C is the same as the number of people who own at least one of them. Let's denote this as N = |A \u222a B \u222a C|.\n\nBut N is equal to the total number of residents minus the number of people who own only D, which is x. So, N = 900 - x.\n\nBut from inclusion-exclusion:\n\nN = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\nWe know |A|, |B|, |C|:\n\n|A| = 195\n\n|B| = 367\n\n|C| = 562\n\nSo, |A| + |B| + |C| = 195 + 367 + 562 = let me compute that.\n\n195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124.\n\nSo, |A| + |B| + |C| = 1124.\n\nNow, what about the pairwise intersections?\n\nEach pairwise intersection |A \u2229 B|, |A \u2229 C|, |B \u2229 C| can be expressed in terms of the numbers y and w. Because the people in these intersections include those who own exactly two items (y) and those who own all three (w).\n\nWait, actually, for the pairwise intersections, the count includes people who own exactly those two and also those who own all three. So, |A \u2229 B| is equal to the number of people who own exactly A and B plus those who own A, B, and C (i.e., w). Similarly for the others.\n\nBut wait, how exactly? Let's think. For |A \u2229 B|, it includes all people who own both A and B. These are the people who own exactly A and B (so they don't own C or any other), and the people who own A, B, and C (so they own all four, which includes D as well). So, |A \u2229 B| = (number of people who own exactly A and B) + w.\n\nSimilarly for |A \u2229 C| and |B \u2229 C|.\n\nBut wait, how many people own exactly A and B? That's a subset of the people who own exactly two items (y = 437). Each of the combinations A&B, A&C, B&C contributes to y.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- Let a be the number of people who own exactly A and B and D (so exactly two items: A, B, D).\n- Let b be the number of people who own exactly A and C and D.\n- Let c be the number of people who own exactly B and C and D.\n\nSo, a + b + c = y = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people who own exactly three items is z = 234. These are the people who own exactly A, B, C, and D, so they're part of all three pairwise intersections. So, |A \u2229 B| includes a and w, |A \u2229 C| includes b and w, and |B \u2229 C| includes c and w.\n\nSo, |A \u2229 B| = a + w\n\n|A \u2229 C| = b + w\n\n|B \u2229 C| = c + w\n\nSo, now, we can write the inclusion-exclusion formula as:\n\nN = |A| + |B| + |C| - (|A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C|) + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\nBut N is also equal to 900 - x.\n\nSo,\n\n900 - x = 1124 - ( (a + w) + (b + w) + (c + w) ) + w\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1124 - (a + b + c + 3w) + w\n\n= 1124 - (a + b + c) - 2w\n\nBut a + b + c = y = 437, so:\n\n= 1124 - 437 - 2w\n\n= 1124 - 437 = 687; so 687 - 2w.\n\nSo, 900 - x = 687 - 2w.\n\nBut we also have from earlier that x + w = 229. So, x = 229 - w.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n900 - (229 - w) = 687 - 2w\n\nCompute the left side:\n\n900 - 229 + w = 671 + w\n\nSo,\n\n671 + w = 687 - 2w\n\nBring terms together:\n\nw + 2w = 687 - 671\n\n3w = 16\n\nw = 16 / 3\n\nWait, that's not possible because w should be an integer. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me go back through the steps.\n\nWait, when I did 900 - x = 687 - 2w, and x = 229 - w, so substituting:\n\n900 - (229 - w) = 687 - 2w\n\nWhich is:\n\n900 - 229 + w = 687 - 2w\n\nWhich is:\n\n671 + w = 687 - 2w\n\nThen,\n\nw + 2w = 687 - 671\n\n3w = 16\n\nw = 16/3 \u2248 5.333\n\nHmm, that's a fraction, which doesn't make sense because the number of people should be an integer. So, I must have made a mistake in my setup.\n\nLet me double-check the inclusion-exclusion part.\n\nWait, in the inclusion-exclusion formula, N = |A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nBut earlier, I considered N as 900 - x, where x is the number of people who own only D. So, that part seems correct.\n\nBut when I computed |A \u2229 B|, I considered it as a + w, where a is the number of people owning exactly A and B and D (so two items), and w is those owning all four. Similarly for the others. So, that seems correct.\n\nThen, |A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C| = (a + w) + (b + w) + (c + w) = a + b + c + 3w = y + 3w = 437 + 3w.\n\nSo, putting that into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\nN = 1124 - (437 + 3w) + w\n\nBecause |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| is w, the number of people owning all three.\n\nSo,\n\nN = 1124 - 437 - 3w + w\n\n= 687 - 2w.\n\nSo, N = 687 - 2w.\n\nBut N is also 900 - x.\n\nSo,\n\n900 - x = 687 - 2w.\n\nAnd since x = 229 - w,\n\n900 - (229 - w) = 687 - 2w\n\nWhich is:\n\n900 - 229 + w = 687 - 2w\n\n671 + w = 687 - 2w\n\nAdding 2w to both sides:\n\n671 + 3w = 687\n\n3w = 687 - 671 = 16\n\nw = 16/3 \u2248 5.333\n\nHmm, this can't be. So, I must have made a wrong assumption in my setup.\n\nWait, let's think again about the inclusion-exclusion. Because the formula for N is |A \u222a B \u222a C|, which is the number of people who own at least one of A, B, or C. But in this problem, everyone owns D, so the total number of people is 900. So, the number of people who own at least one of A, B, or C is 900 minus the number of people who own only D, which is x. So, N = 900 - x.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the way I accounted for the overlaps.\n\nWait, another approach: the total number of people is the sum of those owning exactly 1, 2, 3, or 4 items.\n\nSo,\n\nTotal = x (only D) + y (exactly two: D + one) + z (exactly three: D + two) + w (exactly four: D + three)\n\nWhich is:\n\nx + y + z + w = 900\n\nWe know y=437, z=234, so x + w = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229.\n\nSo, x + w = 229.\n\nNow, let's compute the total number of owners for each item:\n\nEach owner of exactly two items (y) contributes 1 to each of the two items they own. Each owner of exactly three items (z) contributes 1 to each of the three items. Each owner of exactly four items (w) contributes 1 to each of the four items. Each owner of only D contributes 0 to A, B, or C.\n\nWait, but we can model the total counts for A, B, C as:\n\nTotal owners of A = number of people owning exactly A and D (so in y) plus those owning A and another (so in z) plus those owning all four (w).\n\nSimilarly for B and C.\n\nBut let's denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- a: number of people owning exactly A and D (so exactly two items)\n- b: number of people owning exactly B and D\n- c: number of people owning exactly C and D\n\nThen, a + b + c = y = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three items (z) is the number of people owning A, B, D plus those owning A, C, D plus those owning B, C, D. Let me denote:\n\n- d: number of people owning exactly A, B, D\n- e: number of people owning exactly A, C, D\n- f: number of people owning exactly B, C, D\n\nSo, d + e + f = z = 234.\n\nAnd the number of people owning all four items is w, which is the same as the number of people owning A, B, C, D.\n\nSo, now, the total number of owners for each item is:\n\n|A| = a (A and D only) + d (A, B, D) + e (A, C, D) + w (all four)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n|B| = b + d + f + w\n\n|C| = c + e + f + w\n\nWe have:\n\n|A| = 195 = a + d + e + w\n\n|B| = 367 = b + d + f + w\n\n|C| = 562 = c + e + f + w\n\nWe also have:\n\na + b + c = y = 437\n\nd + e + f = z = 234\n\nWe have four equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = 437\n\n2. d + e + f = 234\n\n3. a + d + e + w = 195\n\n4. b + d + f + w = 367\n\n5. c + e + f + w = 562\n\nWe need to solve these equations to find w.\n\nAdditionally, we have:\n\nx + w = 229\n\nBut perhaps we can express a, b, c, d, e, f in terms of each other.\n\nLet me see. Let's take equation 3: a + d + e = 195 - w\n\nEquation 4: b + d + f = 367 - w\n\nEquation 5: c + e + f = 562 - w\n\nWe also have equation 1: a + b + c = 437\n\nEquation 2: d + e + f = 234\n\nHmm, perhaps we can add equations 3,4,5:\n\n(a + d + e) + (b + d + f) + (c + e + f) = (195 - w) + (367 - w) + (562 - w)\n\nLeft side: a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 2w? Wait, no, let me compute:\n\nWait, (a + d + e) + (b + d + f) + (c + e + f) =\n\na + b + c + d + d + e + e + f + f\n\nWhich is (a + b + c) + 2d + 2e + 2f.\n\nFrom equation 1: a + b + c =437\n\nFrom equation 2: d + e + f =234\n\nSo, left side is 437 + 2*(d + e + f) = 437 + 2*234 = 437 + 468 = 905.\n\nRight side: 195 + 367 + 562 - 3w = (195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124) So, 1124 - 3w.\n\nSo,\n\n905 = 1124 - 3w\n\nSolving for w:\n\n3w = 1124 - 905 = 219\n\nw = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nWait, that's an integer. So, w =73.\n\nSo, the number of people who own all four items is 73. Therefore, the answer is 73.\n\nWait, let me check this.\n\nIf w=73, then:\n\nFrom x + w =229, x=229-73=156.\n\nSo, x=156, w=73.\n\nNow, let's compute the other variables.\n\nFrom equation 3: a + d + e =195 -73=122\n\nFrom equation 4: b + d + f =367 -73=294\n\nFrom equation 5: c + e + f =562 -73=489\n\nNow, let's add equations 3,4,5:\n\n(a + d + e) + (b + d + f) + (c + e + f) =122 +294 +489= 905.\n\nWhich matches the earlier result, since 905=905.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\nFrom equation 1: a + b + c=437.\n\nFrom equation 2: d + e + f=234.\n\nBut we have:\n\nFrom equation 3: a + d + e=122 \u2192 a=122 -d -e\n\nFrom equation 4: b + d + f=294 \u2192 b=294 -d -f\n\nFrom equation 5: c + e + f=489 \u2192 c=489 -e -f\n\nNow, substitute a, b, c into equation 1:\n\n(122 -d -e) + (294 -d -f) + (489 -e -f) =437\n\nCompute the sum:\n\n122 + 294 + 489 = 805\n\nThen, -d -e -d -f -e -f = -2d -2e -2f\n\nSo,\n\n805 -2(d + e + f) =437\n\nBut d + e + f=234, so:\n\n805 -2*234 =805 -468=337\n\nBut 337 \u2260437. Wait, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, 805 - 2*234 =805 -468=337. But equation 1 says 437. So, 337\u2260437. That's a contradiction. Hmm, so where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, let me recompute equation 1 after substitution:\n\na + b + c = (122 -d -e) + (294 -d -f) + (489 -e -f)\n\n= 122 + 294 +489 -d -e -d -f -e -f\n\n= 805 -2d -2e -2f\n\nWhich is 805 -2*(d + e + f)\n\nBut d + e + f=234, so:\n\n805 -2*234 =805 -468=337.\n\nBut equation 1 says a + b + c=437, so 337=437? That's not correct. So, there's an inconsistency here. Which suggests that perhaps my equations are incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I made a wrong substitution. Let me check equation 3 again.\n\nEquation 3: a + d + e =122 \u2192 a=122 -d -e\n\nEquation 4: b + d + f=294 \u2192 b=294 -d -f\n\nEquation 5: c + e + f=489 \u2192 c=489 -e -f\n\nSo, a + b + c = (122 -d -e) + (294 -d -f) + (489 -e -f)\n\n=122 +294 +489 -d -e -d -f -e -f\n\n=805 -2d -2e -2f\n\n=805 -2*(d + e + f)\n\nBut d + e + f=234.\n\nSo, 805 -2*234=805-468=337\n\nBut equation 1 says a + b + c=437, so 337=437? No, that's impossible. So, this suggests that there's a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial equations are wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the counts for |A|, |B|, |C| include all the people who own those items, regardless of how many others they own. So, |A| includes people who own exactly A and D (a), exactly A, B, D (d), exactly A, C, D (e), and all four (w). So, |A|=a + d + e + w.\n\nSimilarly for |B| and |C|.\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nThen, the sum of |A| + |B| + |C|=195 + 367 +562=1124.\n\nBut according to the equations:\n\n|A| + |B| + |C|= (a + d + e + w) + (b + d + f + w) + (c + e + f + w)\n\n= a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f +3w\n\nBut a + b + c=437\n\nd + e + f=234\n\nSo,\n\n=437 + 2*234 +3w\n\n=437 +468 +3w=905 +3w\n\nBut this is equal to 1124.\n\nSo,\n\n905 +3w=1124\n\n3w=219\n\nw=73.\n\nWhich is consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nBut then, why when I tried to compute a + b + c did I get a discrepancy?\n\nBecause when I substituted, I get a + b + c=337, but equation 1 says a + b + c=437. So, perhaps I made an error in the substitution.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me re-examine.\n\nEquation 3: a + d + e =195 -w \u2192 195 -73=122 \u2192 correct.\n\nEquation 4: b + d + f=367 -73=294 \u2192 correct.\n\nEquation 5: c + e + f=562 -73=489 \u2192 correct.\n\nEquation 1: a + b + c=437.\n\nSo, a=122 -d -e\n\nb=294 -d -f\n\nc=489 -e -f\n\nSo, a + b + c= (122 -d -e) + (294 -d -f) + (489 -e -f)\n\n= 122 +294 +489 -d -e -d -f -e -f\n\n=805 -2d -2e -2f\n\n=805 -2*(d + e + f)\n\nBut d + e + f=234.\n\nSo,\n\n805 -2*234=805 -468=337.\n\nBut equation 1 says a + b + c=437. So, 337=437? No, that's impossible.\n\nWait, this suggests that the equations are inconsistent, which shouldn't be the case because we derived w=73 from the earlier step. So, perhaps the error is in the way I defined a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption in defining a, b, c as exactly A and D, etc. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this using the inclusion-exclusion formula correctly.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nWe know that:\n\nThe total number of residents is 900.\n\nThe number of people owning exactly two items is 437.\n\nThe number of people owning exactly three items is 234.\n\nThe number of people owning all four items is w.\n\nThe number of people owning exactly one item is x (only D).\n\nSo, the total is x + 437 + 234 + w =900 \u2192 x + w=229.\n\nNow, the number of people owning at least one of A, B, C is N =900 -x.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion formula for A, B, C is:\n\nN = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nWe have |A|=195, |B|=367, |C|=562.\n\nSo, |A| + |B| + |C|=195+367+562=1124.\n\nWe need to find |A\u2229B|, |A\u2229C|, |B\u2229C|, and |A\u2229B\u2229C|.\n\nBut |A\u2229B| includes people who own A and B and possibly other items. Similarly for the others.\n\nBut since everyone owns D, the intersections can be broken down as follows.\n\nEach pairwise intersection |A\u2229B| consists of people who own A, B, and possibly C and/or D.\n\nBut in our case, since D is always owned, the people in |A\u2229B| are those who own A, B, and D (exactly two items: A, B, D) plus those who own A, B, C, D (exactly three items: A, B, C, D). Wait, no, because |A\u2229B| includes all people who own both A and B, regardless of other ownerships. So, it includes those who own exactly A, B, D (two items) and those who own A, B, C, D (four items). So, |A\u2229B|=number of people who own exactly A, B, D (call this a) plus the number who own exactly A, B, C, D (w). So, |A\u2229B|=a + w.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n|A\u2229C|=b + w\n\n|B\u2229C|=c + w\n\nWhere a, b, c are the numbers of people owning exactly two items: A and D; B and D; C and D, respectively.\n\nAnd |A\u2229B\u2229C|=w, because that's the only way someone can be in all three intersections.\n\nSo, putting this into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\nN = 1124 - (|A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|) + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\n= 1124 - [(a + w) + (b + w) + (c + w)] + w\n\n= 1124 - (a + b + c + 3w) + w\n\n= 1124 - (a + b + c) - 2w\n\nBut a + b + c is the number of people owning exactly two items, which is y=437.\n\nSo,\n\nN = 1124 - 437 - 2w = 687 - 2w.\n\nBut N is also equal to 900 - x.\n\nSo,\n\n900 - x =687 -2w \u2192 x = 900 - (687 -2w) = 213 +2w.\n\nBut earlier, we had x +w =229.\n\nSo,\n\n(213 +2w) +w =229 \u2192213 +3w=229 \u21923w=16 \u2192w=16/3 \u22485.333.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. But this leads to a fractional w, which is impossible. So, where is the mistake?\n\nAh, wait a minute. The inclusion-exclusion counts N as the number of people owning at least one of A, B, or C. But since everyone owns D, the number of people owning at least one of A, B, or C is equal to 900 minus the number of people owning only D, which is x. So, N=900 -x.\n\nBut according to inclusion-exclusion, N=687 -2w.\n\nSo,\n\n900 -x =687 -2w \u2192 x=900 -687 +2w=213 +2w.\n\nAnd from x +w=229, substituting x:\n\n213 +2w +w=229 \u2192213 +3w=229 \u21923w=16 \u2192w=16/3.\n\nHmm, but 16/3 is not an integer, which is impossible because w must be an integer.\n\nThis suggests that there's a contradiction, which shouldn't happen because the problem is given, so perhaps I made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in defining the pairwise intersections. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem lies in the initial assumption about the number of people owning exactly two items. The problem says 437 own exactly two of the four things. But since D is always owned, the 437 includes those who own D and exactly one other. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the inclusion-exclusion formula, the intersections |A\u2229B|, |A\u2229C|, |B\u2229C| include not just those who own exactly two, but also those who own more. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the total number of people owning exactly two items is 437, but the sum of a, b, c (exactly two items: D plus one) is 437. So, a + b + c=437.\n\nBut when I calculated |A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|= (a + w) + (b + w) + (c +w)= a + b + c +3w=437 +3w.\n\nThen, inclusion-exclusion gives N=1124 - (437 +3w) +w=1124 -437 -2w=687 -2w.\n\nAnd N=900 -x, so 900 -x=687 -2w \u2192x=213 +2w.\n\nAnd x +w=229 \u2192213 +3w=229 \u21923w=16\u2192w=16/3.\n\nBut this is impossible. So, perhaps the problem has no solution? But that can't be, because the problem is given.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inclusion-exclusion formula. Let me re-examine it.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated |A\u2229B|, etc.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Since everyone owns D, the counts for A, B, C include those who also own D. So, perhaps the counts for |A\u2229B| include those who own A, B, and D, but not those who own A, B, C, D. Because if someone owns all four, they're included in all the pairwise intersections.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. |A\u2229B| includes everyone who owns both A and B, regardless of whether they own C or not. So, if someone owns A, B, C, D, they are included in |A\u2229B|.\n\nSo, |A\u2229B|=number of people owning A and B and D (exactly two items) plus those owning A, B, C, D (all four items). So, |A\u2229B|=a + w.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo, the previous approach seems correct. But the result is impossible, which suggests that perhaps the problem's numbers are inconsistent. But since the problem is given, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me try to compute w using the initial approach again.\n\nFrom the inclusion-exclusion:\n\nN=|A \u222a B \u222a C|=900 -x=687 -2w.\n\nSo,\n\n900 -x=687 -2w \u2192x=213 +2w.\n\nAnd x +w=229 \u2192213 +3w=229\u21923w=16\u2192w=16/3.\n\nHmm, but 16/3 is about 5.333, which is not an integer. So, perhaps the problem has a mistake, or I'm missing a key point.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem doesn't say that each resident owns exactly one bag of candy hearts, but that each owns at least one. No, the problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, that's definite.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that I'm miscounting the number of people in the intersections. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let w be the number of people who own all four items.\n\nThen, the number of people who own exactly three items is 234, which would be the number of people who own D and exactly two of A, B, C. So, these are people who own three items: D plus two of A, B, C. So, they don't own all four, they own exactly three.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the 234 own exactly three, which would be D plus two others. So, the number of people owning exactly three items is 234, and the number owning exactly four is w.\n\nSo, the total number of people owning at least three items is 234 +w.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly two items is 437, which is D plus one other.\n\nSo, the total number of people owning exactly one item is x=900 - (437 +234 +w)=900 -671 -w=229 -w.\n\nNow, let's compute the total number of ownerships:\n\nEach person owns at least D, so the total number of ownerships is 900 (for D) plus the number of people owning A, B, or C.\n\nBut the number of people owning A is 195, owning B is 367, owning C is562.\n\nSo, the total number of ownerships for A, B, C is 195 +367 +562=1124.\n\nBut each ownership of A, B, or C is counted as:\n\n- For each person owning exactly two items (D and one other): contributes 1 to A, B, or C.\n\n- For each person owning exactly three items (D and two others): contributes 2 to A, B, or C.\n\n- For each person owning exactly four items (all four): contributes 3 to A, B, or C.\n\n- For each person owning exactly one item (only D): contributes 0.\n\nSo, the total ownerships for A, B, C can also be computed as:\n\nTotal = (number of people owning exactly two items) *1 + (number of people owning exactly three items)*2 + (number of people owning exactly four items)*3.\n\nSo,\n\nTotal =437 *1 +234 *2 +w *3 =437 +468 +3w=905 +3w.\n\nBut we know this equals 1124.\n\nSo,\n\n905 +3w=1124 \u21923w=219 \u2192w=73.\n\nAh, here we go! So, this approach gives w=73, which is an integer. So, the correct answer is 73.\n\nSo, where did I go wrong earlier? I think in the first approach, I tried to use inclusion-exclusion and perhaps misapplied it, leading to a contradiction. But using this ownership count approach gives a consistent result.\n\nSo, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the ownership of the items in Aimeville.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Hmm, let me try to parse it. There are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns at least one of these four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, or a bag of candy hearts. Wait, no, actually, the problem says each owns a bag of candy hearts. So, actually, everyone owns the candy hearts. So that's one thing that's universal.\n\nThen, the other three items\u2014diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade\u2014are owned by some subset of the population. Let me jot down the numbers:\n\n- Diamond rings: 195 owners\n- Golf clubs: 367 owners\n- Garden spades: 562 owners\n- Candy hearts: 900 owners (since everyone has them)\n\nAlso, there are some overlaps:\n\n- 437 residents own exactly two of these things.\n- 234 residents own exactly three of these things.\n\nAnd we need to find the number of residents who own all four things, which includes the candy hearts and the other three. Wait, but since everyone has the candy hearts, owning all four is the same as owning the other three and the candy hearts, which is the same as owning all three of the other items. Or maybe not? Let me think.\n\nSo, in set terms, we can model this with the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Since each person owns at least the candy hearts, the total number of residents is 900. The other three items are optional, but the candy hearts are mandatory. So, maybe I can model the problem by considering the other three items as the variables and the candy hearts as a given.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let A be the set of owners of diamond rings.\n- Let B be the set of owners of golf clubs.\n- Let C be the set of owners of garden spades.\n- Let D be the set of owners of candy hearts. But since everyone owns D, D is the universal set here.\n\nSo, we're looking for |A \u2229 B \u2229 C \u2229 D|, but since D includes everyone, this is the same as |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|. So, the number we're looking for is the number of people who own all three of A, B, and C.\n\nBut wait, the problem says 234 residents own exactly three of these things. But since everyone owns D (candy hearts), owning exactly three would mean they own three of A, B, C, and D. So, actually, the 234 people own all four. Wait, no, no\u2014let me clarify.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\" Since D is one of the four things, and everyone owns D, owning exactly two would mean owning D plus one other, and owning exactly three would mean owning D plus two others. So, the 234 residents who own exactly three of the four things actually own all four, because they have D plus two others. Wait, no\u2014exactly three would be D plus two others, so they have three in total, not four. Because if they have D plus two others, that's three. So, they don't have all four, they have three. So, the 234 residents have exactly three: D plus two of A, B, C. And the 437 have exactly two: D plus one of A, B, C.\n\nSo, the people who own all four (A, B, C, D) are not included in the 234 who own exactly three. So, our target is to find the number of people in A \u2229 B \u2229 C \u2229 D, which is the same as |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|, because D is universal.\n\nSo, how do we find |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|? Let's recall inclusion-exclusion for three sets. The formula for the union of A, B, and C is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\nBut we don't know |A \u222a B \u222a C| because the problem doesn't directly tell us. Wait, but since everyone owns D, the total number of residents is 900. So, the number of people who own at least one of A, B, or C is equal to 900 minus the number of people who own only D. Wait, but the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so they might own only D, or D plus some combination.\n\nWait, but the problem also states that there are 437 who own exactly two things and 234 who own exactly three things. So, let's see, the residents can be categorized based on how many of the four items they own. But since D is always owned, the number of items they own is 1 to 4.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Since D is mandatory, the number of additional items they can own is 0, 1, 2, or 3. So, the possible counts are:\n\n- Exactly 1 item: only D.\n- Exactly 2 items: D plus one more (A, B, or C).\n- Exactly 3 items: D plus two more.\n- Exactly 4 items: D plus all three.\n\nSo, the problem says that 437 own exactly two of the four things. But since D is one of them, exactly two would mean D plus one of A, B, C. Similarly, exactly three would mean D plus two of A, B, C. And exactly four would mean D plus all three of A, B, C.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\n- Let x be the number of people who own exactly D (only one item).\n- Let y be the number of people who own exactly D and one other (exactly two items). The problem states this is 437.\n- Let z be the number of people who own exactly D and two others (exactly three items). The problem states this is 234.\n- Let w be the number of people who own all four items (D and A, B, C). We need to find this.\n\nSo, the total number of residents is x + y + z + w = 900.\n\nWe also know that y = 437, z = 234, so x + 437 + 234 + w = 900. So, x + w = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229. So, x + w = 229.\n\nNow, we can also compute the total number of people who own at least one of A, B, or C. Since D is universal, the number of people who own A, B, or C is the same as the number of people who own at least one of them. Let's denote this as N = |A \u222a B \u222a C|.\n\nBut N is equal to the total number of residents minus the number of people who own only D, which is x. So, N = 900 - x.\n\nBut from inclusion-exclusion:\n\nN = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\nWe know |A|, |B|, |C|:\n\n|A| = 195\n\n|B| = 367\n\n|C| = 562\n\nSo, |A| + |B| + |C| = 195 + 367 + 562 = let me compute that.\n\n195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124.\n\nSo, |A| + |B| + |C| = 1124.\n\nNow, what about the pairwise intersections?\n\nEach pairwise intersection |A \u2229 B|, |A \u2229 C|, |B \u2229 C| can be expressed in terms of the numbers y and w. Because the people in these intersections include those who own exactly two items (y) and those who own all three (w).\n\nWait, actually, for the pairwise intersections, the count includes people who own exactly those two and also those who own all three. So, |A \u2229 B| is equal to the number of people who own exactly A and B plus those who own A, B, and C (i.e., w). Similarly for the others.\n\nBut wait, how exactly? Let's think. For |A \u2229 B|, it includes all people who own both A and B. These are the people who own exactly A and B (so they don't own C or any other), and the people who own A, B, and C (so they own all four, which includes D as well). So, |A \u2229 B| = (number of people who own exactly A and B) + w.\n\nSimilarly for |A \u2229 C| and |B \u2229 C|.\n\nBut wait, how many people own exactly A and B? That's a subset of the people who own exactly two items (y = 437). Each of the combinations A&B, A&C, B&C contributes to y.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- Let a be the number of people who own exactly A and B and D (so exactly two items: A, B, D).\n- Let b be the number of people who own exactly A and C and D.\n- Let c be the number of people who own exactly B and C and D.\n\nSo, a + b + c = y = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people who own exactly three items is z = 234. These are the people who own exactly A, B, C, and D, so they're part of all three pairwise intersections. So, |A \u2229 B| includes a and w, |A \u2229 C| includes b and w, and |B \u2229 C| includes c and w.\n\nSo, |A \u2229 B| = a + w\n\n|A \u2229 C| = b + w\n\n|B \u2229 C| = c + w\n\nSo, now, we can write the inclusion-exclusion formula as:\n\nN = |A| + |B| + |C| - (|A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C|) + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\nBut N is also equal to 900 - x.\n\nSo,\n\n900 - x = 1124 - ( (a + w) + (b + w) + (c + w) ) + w\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1124 - (a + b + c + 3w) + w\n\n= 1124 - (a + b + c) - 2w\n\nBut a + b + c = y = 437, so:\n\n= 1124 - 437 - 2w\n\n= 1124 - 437 = 687; so 687 - 2w.\n\nSo, 900 - x = 687 - 2w.\n\nBut we also have from earlier that x + w = 229. So, x = 229 - w.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n900 - (229 - w) = 687 - 2w\n\nCompute the left side:\n\n900 - 229 + w = 671 + w\n\nSo,\n\n671 + w = 687 - 2w\n\nBring terms together:\n\nw + 2w = 687 - 671\n\n3w = 16\n\nw = 16 / 3\n\nWait, that's not possible because w should be an integer. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me go back through the steps.\n\nWait, when I did 900 - x = 687 - 2w, and x = 229 - w, so substituting:\n\n900 - (229 - w) = 687 - 2w\n\nWhich is:\n\n900 - 229 + w = 687 - 2w\n\nWhich is:\n\n671 + w = 687 - 2w\n\nThen,\n\nw + 2w = 687 - 671\n\n3w = 16\n\nw = 16/3 \u2248 5.333\n\nHmm, that's a fraction, which doesn't make sense because the number of people should be an integer. So, I must have made a mistake in my setup.\n\nLet me double-check the inclusion-exclusion part.\n\nWait, in the inclusion-exclusion formula, N = |A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nBut earlier, I considered N as 900 - x, where x is the number of people who own only D. So, that part seems correct.\n\nBut when I computed |A \u2229 B|, I considered it as a + w, where a is the number of people owning exactly A and B and D (so two items), and w is those owning all four. Similarly for the others. So, that seems correct.\n\nThen, |A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C| = (a + w) + (b + w) + (c + w) = a + b + c + 3w = y + 3w = 437 + 3w.\n\nSo, putting that into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\nN = 1124 - (437 + 3w) + w\n\nBecause |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| is w, the number of people owning all three.\n\nSo,\n\nN = 1124 - 437 - 3w + w\n\n= 687 - 2w.\n\nSo, N = 687 - 2w.\n\nBut N is also 900 - x.\n\nSo,\n\n900 - x = 687 - 2w.\n\nAnd since x = 229 - w,\n\n900 - (229 - w) = 687 - 2w\n\nWhich is:\n\n900 - 229 + w = 687 - 2w\n\n671 + w = 687 - 2w\n\nAdding 2w to both sides:\n\n671 + 3w = 687\n\n3w = 687 - 671 = 16\n\nw = 16/3 \u2248 5.333\n\nHmm, this can't be. So, I must have made a wrong assumption in my setup.\n\nWait, let's think again about the inclusion-exclusion. Because the formula for N is |A \u222a B \u222a C|, which is the number of people who own at least one of A, B, or C. But in this problem, everyone owns D, so the total number of people is 900. So, the number of people who own at least one of A, B, or C is 900 minus the number of people who own only D, which is x. So, N = 900 - x.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the way I accounted for the overlaps.\n\nWait, another approach: the total number of people is the sum of those owning exactly 1, 2, 3, or 4 items.\n\nSo,\n\nTotal = x (only D) + y (exactly two: D + one) + z (exactly three: D + two) + w (exactly four: D + three)\n\nWhich is:\n\nx + y + z + w = 900\n\nWe know y=437, z=234, so x + w = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229.\n\nSo, x + w = 229.\n\nNow, let's compute the total number of owners for each item:\n\nEach owner of exactly two items (y) contributes 1 to each of the two items they own. Each owner of exactly three items (z) contributes 1 to each of the three items. Each owner of exactly four items (w) contributes 1 to each of the four items. Each owner of only D contributes 0 to A, B, or C.\n\nWait, but we can model the total counts for A, B, C as:\n\nTotal owners of A = number of people owning exactly A and D (so in y) plus those owning A and another (so in z) plus those owning all four (w).\n\nSimilarly for B and C.\n\nBut let's denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- a: number of people owning exactly A and D (so exactly two items)\n- b: number of people owning exactly B and D\n- c: number of people owning exactly C and D\n\nThen, a + b + c = y = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three items (z) is the number of people owning A, B, D plus those owning A, C, D plus those owning B, C, D. Let me denote:\n\n- d: number of people owning exactly A, B, D\n- e: number of people owning exactly A, C, D\n- f: number of people owning exactly B, C, D\n\nSo, d + e + f = z = 234.\n\nAnd the number of people owning all four items is w, which is the same as the number of people owning A, B, C, D.\n\nSo, now, the total number of owners for each item is:\n\n|A| = a (A and D only) + d (A, B, D) + e (A, C, D) + w (all four)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n|B| = b + d + f + w\n\n|C| = c + e + f + w\n\nWe have:\n\n|A| = 195 = a + d + e + w\n\n|B| = 367 = b + d + f + w\n\n|C| = 562 = c + e + f + w\n\nWe also have:\n\na + b + c = y = 437\n\nd + e + f = z = 234\n\nWe have four equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = 437\n\n2. d + e + f = 234\n\n3. a + d + e + w = 195\n\n4. b + d + f + w = 367\n\n5. c + e + f + w = 562\n\nWe need to solve these equations to find w.\n\nAdditionally, we have:\n\nx + w = 229\n\nBut perhaps we can express a, b, c, d, e, f in terms of each other.\n\nLet me see. Let's take equation 3: a + d + e = 195 - w\n\nEquation 4: b + d + f = 367 - w\n\nEquation 5: c + e + f = 562 - w\n\nWe also have equation 1: a + b + c = 437\n\nEquation 2: d + e + f = 234\n\nHmm, perhaps we can add equations 3,4,5:\n\n(a + d + e) + (b + d + f) + (c + e + f) = (195 - w) + (367 - w) + (562 - w)\n\nLeft side: a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 2w? Wait, no, let me compute:\n\nWait, (a + d + e) + (b + d + f) + (c + e + f) =\n\na + b + c + d + d + e + e + f + f\n\nWhich is (a + b + c) + 2d + 2e + 2f.\n\nFrom equation 1: a + b + c =437\n\nFrom equation 2: d + e + f =234\n\nSo, left side is 437 + 2*(d + e + f) = 437 + 2*234 = 437 + 468 = 905.\n\nRight side: 195 + 367 + 562 - 3w = (195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124) So, 1124 - 3w.\n\nSo,\n\n905 = 1124 - 3w\n\nSolving for w:\n\n3w = 1124 - 905 = 219\n\nw = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nWait, that's an integer. So, w =73.\n\nSo, the number of people who own all four items is 73. Therefore, the answer is 73.\n\nWait, let me check this.\n\nIf w=73, then:\n\nFrom x + w =229, x=229-73=156.\n\nSo, x=156, w=73.\n\nNow, let's compute the other variables.\n\nFrom equation 3: a + d + e =195 -73=122\n\nFrom equation 4: b + d + f =367 -73=294\n\nFrom equation 5: c + e + f =562 -73=489\n\nNow, let's add equations 3,4,5:\n\n(a + d + e) + (b + d + f) + (c + e + f) =122 +294 +489= 905.\n\nWhich matches the earlier result, since 905=905.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\nFrom equation 1: a + b + c=437.\n\nFrom equation 2: d + e + f=234.\n\nBut we have:\n\nFrom equation 3: a + d + e=122 \u2192 a=122 -d -e\n\nFrom equation 4: b + d + f=294 \u2192 b=294 -d -f\n\nFrom equation 5: c + e + f=489 \u2192 c=489 -e -f\n\nNow, substitute a, b, c into equation 1:\n\n(122 -d -e) + (294 -d -f) + (489 -e -f) =437\n\nCompute the sum:\n\n122 + 294 + 489 = 805\n\nThen, -d -e -d -f -e -f = -2d -2e -2f\n\nSo,\n\n805 -2(d + e + f) =437\n\nBut d + e + f=234, so:\n\n805 -2*234 =805 -468=337\n\nBut 337 \u2260437. Wait, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, 805 - 2*234 =805 -468=337. But equation 1 says 437. So, 337\u2260437. That's a contradiction. Hmm, so where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, let me recompute equation 1 after substitution:\n\na + b + c = (122 -d -e) + (294 -d -f) + (489 -e -f)\n\n= 122 + 294 +489 -d -e -d -f -e -f\n\n= 805 -2d -2e -2f\n\nWhich is 805 -2*(d + e + f)\n\nBut d + e + f=234, so:\n\n805 -2*234 =805 -468=337.\n\nBut equation 1 says a + b + c=437, so 337=437? That's not correct. So, there's an inconsistency here. Which suggests that perhaps my equations are incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I made a wrong substitution. Let me check equation 3 again.\n\nEquation 3: a + d + e =122 \u2192 a=122 -d -e\n\nEquation 4: b + d + f=294 \u2192 b=294 -d -f\n\nEquation 5: c + e + f=489 \u2192 c=489 -e -f\n\nSo, a + b + c = (122 -d -e) + (294 -d -f) + (489 -e -f)\n\n=122 +294 +489 -d -e -d -f -e -f\n\n=805 -2d -2e -2f\n\n=805 -2*(d + e + f)\n\nBut d + e + f=234.\n\nSo, 805 -2*234=805-468=337\n\nBut equation 1 says a + b + c=437, so 337=437? No, that's impossible. So, this suggests that there's a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial equations are wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the counts for |A|, |B|, |C| include all the people who own those items, regardless of how many others they own. So, |A| includes people who own exactly A and D (a), exactly A, B, D (d), exactly A, C, D (e), and all four (w). So, |A|=a + d + e + w.\n\nSimilarly for |B| and |C|.\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nThen, the sum of |A| + |B| + |C|=195 + 367 +562=1124.\n\nBut according to the equations:\n\n|A| + |B| + |C|= (a + d + e + w) + (b + d + f + w) + (c + e + f + w)\n\n= a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f +3w\n\nBut a + b + c=437\n\nd + e + f=234\n\nSo,\n\n=437 + 2*234 +3w\n\n=437 +468 +3w=905 +3w\n\nBut this is equal to 1124.\n\nSo,\n\n905 +3w=1124\n\n3w=219\n\nw=73.\n\nWhich is consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nBut then, why when I tried to compute a + b + c did I get a discrepancy?\n\nBecause when I substituted, I get a + b + c=337, but equation 1 says a + b + c=437. So, perhaps I made an error in the substitution.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me re-examine.\n\nEquation 3: a + d + e =195 -w \u2192 195 -73=122 \u2192 correct.\n\nEquation 4: b + d + f=367 -73=294 \u2192 correct.\n\nEquation 5: c + e + f=562 -73=489 \u2192 correct.\n\nEquation 1: a + b + c=437.\n\nSo, a=122 -d -e\n\nb=294 -d -f\n\nc=489 -e -f\n\nSo, a + b + c= (122 -d -e) + (294 -d -f) + (489 -e -f)\n\n= 122 +294 +489 -d -e -d -f -e -f\n\n=805 -2d -2e -2f\n\n=805 -2*(d + e + f)\n\nBut d + e + f=234.\n\nSo,\n\n805 -2*234=805 -468=337.\n\nBut equation 1 says a + b + c=437. So, 337=437? No, that's impossible.\n\nWait, this suggests that the equations are inconsistent, which shouldn't be the case because we derived w=73 from the earlier step. So, perhaps the error is in the way I defined a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption in defining a, b, c as exactly A and D, etc. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this using the inclusion-exclusion formula correctly.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nWe know that:\n\nThe total number of residents is 900.\n\nThe number of people owning exactly two items is 437.\n\nThe number of people owning exactly three items is 234.\n\nThe number of people owning all four items is w.\n\nThe number of people owning exactly one item is x (only D).\n\nSo, the total is x + 437 + 234 + w =900 \u2192 x + w=229.\n\nNow, the number of people owning at least one of A, B, C is N =900 -x.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion formula for A, B, C is:\n\nN = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nWe have |A|=195, |B|=367, |C|=562.\n\nSo, |A| + |B| + |C|=195+367+562=1124.\n\nWe need to find |A\u2229B|, |A\u2229C|, |B\u2229C|, and |A\u2229B\u2229C|.\n\nBut |A\u2229B| includes people who own A and B and possibly other items. Similarly for the others.\n\nBut since everyone owns D, the intersections can be broken down as follows.\n\nEach pairwise intersection |A\u2229B| consists of people who own A, B, and possibly C and/or D.\n\nBut in our case, since D is always owned, the people in |A\u2229B| are those who own A, B, and D (exactly two items: A, B, D) plus those who own A, B, C, D (exactly three items: A, B, C, D). Wait, no, because |A\u2229B| includes all people who own both A and B, regardless of other ownerships. So, it includes those who own exactly A, B, D (two items) and those who own A, B, C, D (four items). So, |A\u2229B|=number of people who own exactly A, B, D (call this a) plus the number who own exactly A, B, C, D (w). So, |A\u2229B|=a + w.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n|A\u2229C|=b + w\n\n|B\u2229C|=c + w\n\nWhere a, b, c are the numbers of people owning exactly two items: A and D; B and D; C and D, respectively.\n\nAnd |A\u2229B\u2229C|=w, because that's the only way someone can be in all three intersections.\n\nSo, putting this into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\nN = 1124 - (|A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|) + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\n= 1124 - [(a + w) + (b + w) + (c + w)] + w\n\n= 1124 - (a + b + c + 3w) + w\n\n= 1124 - (a + b + c) - 2w\n\nBut a + b + c is the number of people owning exactly two items, which is y=437.\n\nSo,\n\nN = 1124 - 437 - 2w = 687 - 2w.\n\nBut N is also equal to 900 - x.\n\nSo,\n\n900 - x =687 -2w \u2192 x = 900 - (687 -2w) = 213 +2w.\n\nBut earlier, we had x +w =229.\n\nSo,\n\n(213 +2w) +w =229 \u2192213 +3w=229 \u21923w=16 \u2192w=16/3 \u22485.333.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. But this leads to a fractional w, which is impossible. So, where is the mistake?\n\nAh, wait a minute. The inclusion-exclusion counts N as the number of people owning at least one of A, B, or C. But since everyone owns D, the number of people owning at least one of A, B, or C is equal to 900 minus the number of people owning only D, which is x. So, N=900 -x.\n\nBut according to inclusion-exclusion, N=687 -2w.\n\nSo,\n\n900 -x =687 -2w \u2192 x=900 -687 +2w=213 +2w.\n\nAnd from x +w=229, substituting x:\n\n213 +2w +w=229 \u2192213 +3w=229 \u21923w=16 \u2192w=16/3.\n\nHmm, but 16/3 is not an integer, which is impossible because w must be an integer.\n\nThis suggests that there's a contradiction, which shouldn't happen because the problem is given, so perhaps I made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in defining the pairwise intersections. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem lies in the initial assumption about the number of people owning exactly two items. The problem says 437 own exactly two of the four things. But since D is always owned, the 437 includes those who own D and exactly one other. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the inclusion-exclusion formula, the intersections |A\u2229B|, |A\u2229C|, |B\u2229C| include not just those who own exactly two, but also those who own more. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the total number of people owning exactly two items is 437, but the sum of a, b, c (exactly two items: D plus one) is 437. So, a + b + c=437.\n\nBut when I calculated |A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|= (a + w) + (b + w) + (c +w)= a + b + c +3w=437 +3w.\n\nThen, inclusion-exclusion gives N=1124 - (437 +3w) +w=1124 -437 -2w=687 -2w.\n\nAnd N=900 -x, so 900 -x=687 -2w \u2192x=213 +2w.\n\nAnd x +w=229 \u2192213 +3w=229 \u21923w=16\u2192w=16/3.\n\nBut this is impossible. So, perhaps the problem has no solution? But that can't be, because the problem is given.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inclusion-exclusion formula. Let me re-examine it.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated |A\u2229B|, etc.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Since everyone owns D, the counts for A, B, C include those who also own D. So, perhaps the counts for |A\u2229B| include those who own A, B, and D, but not those who own A, B, C, D. Because if someone owns all four, they're included in all the pairwise intersections.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. |A\u2229B| includes everyone who owns both A and B, regardless of whether they own C or not. So, if someone owns A, B, C, D, they are included in |A\u2229B|.\n\nSo, |A\u2229B|=number of people owning A and B and D (exactly two items) plus those owning A, B, C, D (all four items). So, |A\u2229B|=a + w.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo, the previous approach seems correct. But the result is impossible, which suggests that perhaps the problem's numbers are inconsistent. But since the problem is given, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me try to compute w using the initial approach again.\n\nFrom the inclusion-exclusion:\n\nN=|A \u222a B \u222a C|=900 -x=687 -2w.\n\nSo,\n\n900 -x=687 -2w \u2192x=213 +2w.\n\nAnd x +w=229 \u2192213 +3w=229\u21923w=16\u2192w=16/3.\n\nHmm, but 16/3 is about 5.333, which is not an integer. So, perhaps the problem has a mistake, or I'm missing a key point.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem doesn't say that each resident owns exactly one bag of candy hearts, but that each owns at least one. No, the problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, that's definite.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that I'm miscounting the number of people in the intersections. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let w be the number of people who own all four items.\n\nThen, the number of people who own exactly three items is 234, which would be the number of people who own D and exactly two of A, B, C. So, these are people who own three items: D plus two of A, B, C. So, they don't own all four, they own exactly three.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the 234 own exactly three, which would be D plus two others. So, the number of people owning exactly three items is 234, and the number owning exactly four is w.\n\nSo, the total number of people owning at least three items is 234 +w.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly two items is 437, which is D plus one other.\n\nSo, the total number of people owning exactly one item is x=900 - (437 +234 +w)=900 -671 -w=229 -w.\n\nNow, let's compute the total number of ownerships:\n\nEach person owns at least D, so the total number of ownerships is 900 (for D) plus the number of people owning A, B, or C.\n\nBut the number of people owning A is 195, owning B is 367, owning C is562.\n\nSo, the total number of ownerships for A, B, C is 195 +367 +562=1124.\n\nBut each ownership of A, B, or C is counted as:\n\n- For each person owning exactly two items (D and one other): contributes 1 to A, B, or C.\n\n- For each person owning exactly three items (D and two others): contributes 2 to A, B, or C.\n\n- For each person owning exactly four items (all four): contributes 3 to A, B, or C.\n\n- For each person owning exactly one item (only D): contributes 0.\n\nSo, the total ownerships for A, B, C can also be computed as:\n\nTotal = (number of people owning exactly two items) *1 + (number of people owning exactly three items)*2 + (number of people owning exactly four items)*3.\n\nSo,\n\nTotal =437 *1 +234 *2 +w *3 =437 +468 +3w=905 +3w.\n\nBut we know this equals 1124.\n\nSo,\n\n905 +3w=1124 \u21923w=219 \u2192w=73.\n\nAh, here we go! So, this approach gives w=73, which is an integer. So, the correct answer is 73.\n\nSo, where did I go wrong earlier? I think in the first approach, I tried to use inclusion-exclusion and perhaps misapplied it, leading to a contradiction. But using this ownership count approach gives a consistent result.\n\nSo, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the ownership of the items in Aimeville. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Total residents: 900.\n   - Residents owning exactly two items: 437.\n   - Residents owning exactly three items: 234.\n   - Let \\( w \\) be the number of residents owning all four items.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of residents owning only the candy hearts (D).\n\n2. **Total Residents Equation:**\n   \\[\n   x + 437 + 234 + w = 900 \\implies x + w = 229.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Ownership Counts for A, B, C:**\n   - Total ownerships for A, B, and C: \\( 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124 \\).\n   - Ownership counts can also be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total} = (\\text{exactly two items}) \\times 1 + (\\text{exactly three items}) \\times 2 + (\\text{exactly four items}) \\times 3.\n     \\]\n     Substituting the known values:\n     \\[\n     1124 = 437 \\times 1 + 234 \\times 2 + w \\times 3.\n     \\]\n     Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     1124 = 437 + 468 + 3w \\implies 1124 = 905 + 3w \\implies 3w = 219 \\implies w = 73.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The number of residents who own all four items is \\( \\boxed{73} \\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we're dealing with set theory and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Hmm, let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nThere are 900 residents in Aimeville. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. Additionally, some own other things: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. \n\nWait, but everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's like a fourth item. So, in total, there are four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. And every resident owns at least the candy hearts, since it's stated that each owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the candy hearts are universal in this context.\n\nNow, the problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We need to find how many own all four. So, the four things are D (diamond ring), G (golf clubs), S (spade), and C (candy hearts). But since everyone has C, it's included in everything.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, the candy hearts are owned by all, so C is a subset of everyone. So, any ownership counts would include C. But wait, when it talks about owning exactly two, does that include the candy hearts or not?\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think. The problem says, \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, when it says someone owns exactly two of these things, it's referring to the other three items, or does it include the candy hearts? That's a critical point.\n\nWait, the way it's phrased: \"there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things.\" The \"these things\" probably refers to diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Because earlier it lists the three items and then says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, all four items are the things being considered.\n\nSo, when it says exactly two, that would include candy hearts as one of the two. Similarly, exactly three would include candy hearts as one of the three.\n\nWait, but if everyone owns candy hearts, then no one owns exactly zero or exactly one without candy hearts. Because candy hearts are a given. So, the possible ownerships are exactly one, two, three, or four, but all include at least the candy hearts.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's given that 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, the total number of residents is 900, and we need to find those who own all four.\n\nLet me define some variables to model this. Let me denote:\n\n- n(C) = 900, since everyone owns candy hearts.\n\n- n(D) = 195, n(G) = 367, n(S) = 562.\n\nWe're to find n(D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C), which is the number of people owning all four. Since C is universal, this is the same as n(D \u2229 G \u2229 S).\n\nWait, but since everyone has C, any intersection involving C is just the intersection of the other sets. So, yeah, n(D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C) = n(D \u2229 G \u2229 S).\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think in terms of inclusion-exclusion, considering all four sets.\n\nWait, but maybe I should model this using the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. But that might be complicated, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, since candy hearts are universal, perhaps we can model the problem without considering C explicitly, except that all other sets are subsets of C. Hmm, that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the problem by considering that each resident owns at least C, and the other three items. So, each person's ownership is a subset of {D, G, S, C}, but must include C.\n\nSo, the possible cases are: owns only C, owns C and one other, owns C and two others, owns C and three others, or owns all four. But wait, the problem states that 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. So, exactly two would be owning C plus one other? Or exactly two including C.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"exactly two of these things.\" Since these things include C, so exactly two would mean exactly two, including C. So, for example, a person who owns only C and D would be counted in the exactly two category.\n\nSimilarly, someone owning C, D, and G would be in the exactly three category.\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\n- Exactly two: 437 people. This includes all pairs among D, G, S, and C.\n\nWait, no, since C is already included in everyone, so exactly two would be C plus one other. Because if someone has exactly two, that would be C plus one of the others. Because without C, they can't have anything else, but since everyone has C, the only way to have exactly two is to have C and one other.\n\nWait, no, that's not necessarily true. Because if someone has C, D, and G, that's three. But if someone has C, D, and S, that's three, and so on.\n\nBut let's think: how many people have exactly two of the four things? Since they must have C and exactly one more, because if they have C and two others, that's three, which is in the exactly three category.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because someone could have C, D, and G, which would be three things, but someone could have D, G, and S, which doesn't include C? Wait, no, because C is owned by everyone. So, everyone must have C, so no one can have only D and G without C. Because the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that means all ownerships must include C. So, someone can't have exactly two things without C, because they have to have C.\n\nTherefore, the only way someone can have exactly two things is if they have C plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would be C plus two others, and exactly four is all four.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because everyone has C, so the number of residents with exactly two things is the number of people who have C and exactly one other item. Similarly, exactly three is C plus two others, and exactly four is all four.\n\nSo, the problem states that 437 own exactly two of these things, which would mean 437 have C plus one other item. Similarly, 234 have exactly three, which is C plus two others.\n\nSo, now, let's model this with inclusion-exclusion.\n\nLet me denote the following:\n\nLet a = number of people owning exactly two things (C + one other) = 437.\n\nLet b = number owning exactly three things (C + two others) = 234.\n\nLet c = number owning all four things (C + all three others) = x, which is what we're trying to find.\n\nLet me also denote the number of people owning exactly one thing. Since everyone has C, the only way to have exactly one thing is to have only C. So, let d be the number of people who own only C.\n\nSo, the total number of people is d + a + b + c = 900.\n\nBut we don't know d yet. Hmm. So, we have to find d as well, but maybe we can express everything in terms of d.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find d using the given data.\n\nWait, the total number of people owning each item is as follows:\n\nn(D) = 195: this includes people who own D and possibly other items.\n\nSimilarly, n(G) = 367, n(S) = 562.\n\nBut since everyone owns C, the counts of D, G, S include all the people who own those items along with C and possibly others.\n\nSo, let's model the number of people owning each item.\n\nn(D) = number of people who own D. Since D is only owned along with C and possibly other items, n(D) is the number of people who have D and C, plus those who have D, C, and one more item, plus those who have all four.\n\nSimilarly, n(D) = number of people owning D only (but wait, no, because everyone has C, so D is always with C. So, actually, the number of people owning D is equal to the number of people who have D and C only, plus those who have D, C, and another item, plus those who have all four.\n\nWait, but in our definitions above, a is the number of people owning exactly two things, which would be C plus one other. So, if someone owns D and C only, that's exactly two, so they are included in a.\n\nSimilarly, people who own D, C, and G would be exactly three, so included in b.\n\nAnd those who own all four would be included in c.\n\nSo, n(D) = number of people with D and C only (which is part of a) + number with D, C, and another item (part of b) + number with all four (part of c).\n\nSimilarly, n(D) = (number with D and C only) + (number with D, C, and G) + (number with D, C, and S) + (number with all four).\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, n(D) can be expressed as the sum over all subsets that include D and C.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express n(D) as the sum of people who have D and C only, D and C and G, D and C and S, and all four. Similarly for n(G) and n(S).\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- The number of people who have exactly two items is a = 437. These are people who have C and exactly one other item. So, the count for each single item (D, G, S) in a is the number of people who have only C and that item.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- a_D = number of people with exactly C and D only.\n\n- a_G = exactly C and G only.\n\n- a_S = exactly C and S only.\n\nSo, a = a_D + a_G + a_S = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people with exactly three items is b = 234. These are people who have C and exactly two other items.\n\nSo, the number of people with C, D, and G only is b_DG.\n\nSimilarly, b_DG, b_DS, b_GS.\n\nSo, b = b_DG + b_DS + b_GS = 234.\n\nAnd the number of people with all four items is c = x.\n\nNow, the total number of people is d + a + b + c = 900.\n\nBut d is the number of people who have only C.\n\nNow, the total number of people owning D is:\n\nn(D) = a_D + b_DG + b_DS + c.\n\nSimilarly, n(D) = 195 = a_D + b_DG + b_DS + x.\n\nSimilarly for n(G) = 367 = a_G + b_DG + b_GS + x.\n\nAnd n(S) = 562 = a_S + b_DS + b_GS + x.\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\n1) 195 = a_D + b_DG + b_DS + x\n\n2) 367 = a_G + b_DG + b_GS + x\n\n3) 562 = a_S + b_DS + b_GS + x\n\nAnd we also have:\n\na = a_D + a_G + a_S = 437\n\nb = b_DG + b_DS + b_GS = 234\n\nAnd d + a + b + c = 900 \u2192 d = 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x.\n\nBut wait, d cannot be negative, so x must be less than 229.\n\nNow, let's sum up the equations 1, 2, and 3.\n\nSum = 195 + 367 + 562 = (a_D + a_G + a_S) + (b_DG + b_DS + b_GS) + 3x.\n\nBecause each of the terms b_DG, b_DS, b_GS appears twice in the sum of equations 1, 2, 3, right?\n\nWait, let me see. Equation 1: a_D + b_DG + b_DS + x\n\nEquation 2: a_G + b_DG + b_GS + x\n\nEquation 3: a_S + b_DS + b_GS + x\n\nSumming them:\n\n(a_D + a_G + a_S) + (b_DG + b_DS + b_GS) + (b_DG + b_DS + b_GS) + 3x.\n\nWait, no, let's compute term by term.\n\nSum of left sides: 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSum of right sides: (a_D + b_DG + b_DS + x) + (a_G + b_DG + b_GS + x) + (a_S + b_DS + b_GS + x)\n\n= (a_D + a_G + a_S) + (b_DG + b_DG) + (b_DS + b_DS) + (b_GS + b_GS) + 3x.\n\nSo, that's (a) + 2*(b_DG + b_DS + b_GS) + 3x.\n\nBut a = 437, and b = 234, so b_DG + b_DS + b_GS = 234.\n\nSo, sum of right sides = 437 + 2*(234) + 3x = 437 + 468 + 3x = 905 + 3x.\n\nBut the sum of left sides is 1124.\n\nSo, 905 + 3x = 1124 \u2192 3x = 1124 - 905 = 219 \u2192 x = 73.\n\nSo, the number of people who own all four items is 73.\n\nWait, let me double-check that math.\n\nSum of left sides: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124. Hmm, 195 + 367 is actually 562? Wait, 195 + 367 is 562? Let me compute: 195 + 367: 195+300=495, 495+67=562. Yes. Then 562 + 562 = 1124? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the sum is 195 + 367 + 562. Let me compute that correctly.\n\n195 + 367: 195+300=495, 495+67=562.\n\n562 + 562 = 1124. Yes, correct.\n\nSum of right sides: a + 2b + 3x.\n\na=437, b=234.\n\nSo, 437 + 2*234 = 437 + 468 = 905.\n\nThen 905 + 3x = 1124 \u2192 3x=219 \u2192 x=73.\n\nSo, x is 73. So, the number of residents who own all four is 73.\n\nLet me just confirm if this makes sense with the other constraints.\n\nWe can also find d, which is the number of people who own only C.\n\nd = 900 - a - b - c = 900 - 437 - 234 -73.\n\nLet me compute: 437 + 234 = 671. 671 + 73 = 744. 900 -744=156.\n\nSo, d=156.\n\nNow, let's see if that makes sense with the individual counts.\n\nFor example, n(D) = a_D + b_DG + b_DS + x.\n\nBut a_D is the number of people with exactly C and D, which is part of a=437.\n\nSimilarly, a_D + a_G + a_S =437.\n\nSo, a_D = number of people with only C and D.\n\nSimilarly, a_G and a_S.\n\nBut perhaps let me compute the total number of people owning each item.\n\nn(D) = a_D + b_DG + b_DS + x.\n\nSimilarly, n(G) = a_G + b_DG + b_GS + x.\n\nn(S) = a_S + b_DS + b_GS + x.\n\nWe can write:\n\nn(D) = (a_D) + (b_DG + b_DS) + x.\n\nBut a_D is part of a, so a_D + a_G + a_S =437.\n\nWait, maybe we can compute a_D, a_G, a_S.\n\nBut maybe it's not necessary since we've already found x.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me see if the numbers add up.\n\nWe have x=73, so let's see:\n\nn(D) = 195 = a_D + b_DG + b_DS +73.\n\nSo, a_D + b_DG + b_DS = 195 -73=122.\n\nSimilarly, n(G)=367 =a_G + b_DG + b_GS +73 \u2192 a_G + b_DG + b_GS=367-73=294.\n\nn(S)=562 =a_S + b_DS + b_GS +73 \u2192 a_S + b_DS + b_GS=562-73=489.\n\nWe also know that:\n\na = a_D + a_G + a_S =437.\n\nb = b_DG + b_DS + b_GS =234.\n\nLet me write down the equations:\n\n1) a_D + b_DG + b_DS =122.\n\n2) a_G + b_DG + b_GS=294.\n\n3) a_S + b_DS + b_GS=489.\n\n4) a_D + a_G + a_S=437.\n\n5) b_DG + b_DS + b_GS=234.\n\nWe can try to solve these equations.\n\nLet me denote equation 5 as: b_DG + b_DS + b_GS=234.\n\nFrom equation 1: a_D =122 - b_DG - b_DS.\n\nFrom equation 2: a_G=294 - b_DG - b_GS.\n\nFrom equation 3: a_S=489 - b_DS - b_GS.\n\nNow, substitute a_D, a_G, a_S into equation 4:\n\n(122 - b_DG - b_DS) + (294 - b_DG - b_GS) + (489 - b_DS - b_GS) =437.\n\nSimplify:\n\n122 +294 +489 - (b_DG + b_DG) - (b_DS + b_DS) - (b_GS + b_GS) =437.\n\nCompute 122+294=416; 416+489=905.\n\nSo, 905 - 2b_DG - 2b_DS -2b_GS =437.\n\nThen, 2(b_DG + b_DS + b_GS) =905 -437=468.\n\nSo, 2*234=468, which is correct because b=234.\n\nSo, this checks out.

The numbers are 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. \n\nWait, but everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's like a fourth item. So, in total, there are four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. And every resident owns at least the candy hearts, since it's stated that each owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the candy hearts are universal in this context.\n\nNow, the problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We need to find how many own all four. So, the four things are D (diamond ring), G (golf clubs), S (spade), and C (candy hearts). But since everyone has C, it's included in everything.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, the candy hearts are owned by all, so C is a subset of everyone. So, any ownership counts would include C. But wait, when it talks about owning exactly two, does that include the candy hearts or not?\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think. The problem says, \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, when it says someone owns exactly two of these things, it's referring to the other three items, or does it include the candy hearts? That's a critical point.\n\nWait, the way it's phrased: \"there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things.\" The \"these things\" probably refers to diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Because earlier it lists the three items and then says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, all four items are the things being considered.\n\nSo, when it says exactly two, that would include candy hearts as one of the two. Similarly, exactly three would include candy hearts as one of the three.\n\nWait, but if everyone owns candy hearts, then no one owns exactly zero or exactly one without candy hearts. Because candy hearts are a given. So, the possible ownerships are exactly one, two, three, or four, but all include at least the candy hearts.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's given that 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, the total number of residents is 900, and we need to find those who own all four.\n\nLet me define some variables to model this. Let me denote:\n\n- n(C) = 900, since everyone owns candy hearts.\n\n- n(D) = 195, n(G) = 367, n(S) = 562.\n\nWe're to find n(D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C), which is the number of people owning all four. Since C is universal, this is the same as n(D \u2229 G \u2229 S).\n\nWait, but since everyone has C, any intersection involving C is just the intersection of the other sets. So, yeah, n(D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C) = n(D \u2229 G \u2229 S).\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think in terms of inclusion-exclusion, considering all four sets.\n\nWait, but maybe I should model this using the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. But that might be complicated, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, since candy hearts are universal, perhaps we can model the problem without considering C explicitly, except that all other sets are subsets of C. Hmm, that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the problem by considering that each resident owns at least C, and the other three items. So, each person's ownership is a subset of {D, G, S, C}, but must include C.\n\nSo, the possible cases are: owns only C, owns C and one other, owns C and two others, owns C and three others, or owns all four. But wait, the problem states that 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. So, exactly two would be owning C plus one other? Or exactly two including C.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"exactly two of these things.\" Since these things include C, so exactly two would mean exactly two, including C. So, for example, a person who owns only C and D would be counted in the exactly two category.\n\nSimilarly, someone owning C, D, and G would be in the exactly three category.\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\n- Exactly two: 437 people. This includes all pairs among D, G, S, and C.\n\nWait, no, since C is already included in everyone, so exactly two would be C plus one other. Because if someone has exactly two, that would be C plus one of the others. Because without C, they can't have anything else, but since everyone has C, the only way to have exactly two is to have C and one other.\n\nWait, no, that's not necessarily true. Because if someone has C, D, and G, that's three. But if someone has C, D, and S, that's three, and so on.\n\nBut let's think: how many people have exactly two of the four things? Since they must have C and exactly one more, because if they have C and two others, that's three, which is in the exactly three category.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because someone could have C, D, and G, which would be three things, but someone could have D, G, and S, which doesn't include C? Wait, no, because C is owned by everyone. So, everyone must have C, so no one can have only D and G without C. Because the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that means all ownerships must include C. So, someone can't have exactly two things without C, because they have to have C.\n\nTherefore, the only way someone can have exactly two things is if they have C plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would be C plus two others, and exactly four is all four.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because everyone has C, so the number of residents with exactly two things is the number of people who have C and exactly one other item. Similarly, exactly three is C plus two others, and exactly four is all four.\n\nSo, the problem states that 437 own exactly two of these things, which would mean 437 have C plus one other item. Similarly, 234 have exactly three, which is C plus two others.\n\nSo, now, let's model this with inclusion-exclusion.\n\nLet me denote the following:\n\nLet a = number of people owning exactly two things (C + one other) = 437.\n\nLet b = number owning exactly three things (C + two others) = 234.\n\nLet c = number owning all four things (C + all three others) = x, which is what we're trying to find.\n\nLet me also denote the number of people owning exactly one thing. Since everyone has C, the only way to have exactly one thing is to have only C. So, let d be the number of people who own only C.\n\nSo, the total number of people is d + a + b + c = 900.\n\nBut we don't know d yet. Hmm. So, we have to find d as well, but maybe we can express everything in terms of d.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find d using the given data.\n\nWait, the total number of people owning each item is as follows:\n\nn(D) = 195: this includes people who own D and possibly other items.\n\nSimilarly, n(G) = 367, n(S) = 562.\n\nBut since everyone owns C, the counts of D, G, S include all the people who own those items along with C and possibly others.\n\nSo, let's model the number of people owning each item.\n\nn(D) = number of people who own D. Since D is only owned along with C and possibly other items, n(D) is the number of people who have D and C, plus those who have D, C, and one more item, plus those who have all four.\n\nSimilarly, n(D) = number of people owning D only (but wait, no, because everyone has C, so D is always with C. So, actually, the number of people owning D is equal to the number of people who have D and C only, plus those who have D, C, and another item, plus those who have all four.\n\nWait, but in our definitions above, a is the number of people owning exactly two things, which would be C plus one other. So, if someone owns D and C only, that's exactly two, so they are included in a.\n\nSimilarly, people who own D, C, and G would be exactly three, so included in b.\n\nAnd those who own all four would be included in c.\n\nSo, n(D) = number of people with D and C only (which is part of a) + number with D, C, and another item (part of b) + number with all four (part of c).\n\nSimilarly, n(D) = (number with D and C only) + (number with D, C, and G) + (number with D, C, and S) + (number with all four).\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, n(D) can be expressed as the sum over all subsets that include D and C.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express n(D) as the sum of people who have D and C only, D and C and G, D and C and S, and all four. Similarly for n(G) and n(S).\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- The number of people who have exactly two items is a = 437. These are people who have C and exactly one other item. So, the count for each single item (D, G, S) in a is the number of people who have only C and that item.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- a_D = number of people with exactly C and D only.\n\n- a_G = exactly C and G only.\n\n- a_S = exactly C and S only.\n\nSo, a = a_D + a_G + a_S = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people with exactly three items is b = 234. These are people who have C and exactly two other items.\n\nSo, the number of people with C, D, and G only is b_DG.\n\nSimilarly, b_DG, b_DS, b_GS.\n\nSo, b = b_DG + b_DS + b_GS = 234.\n\nAnd the number of people with all four items is c = x.\n\nNow, the total number of people is d + a + b + c = 900.\n\nBut d is the number of people who have only C.\n\nNow, the total number of people owning D is:\n\nn(D) = a_D + b_DG + b_DS + c.\n\nSimilarly, n(D) = 195 = a_D + b_DG + b_DS + x.\n\nSimilarly for n(G) = 367 = a_G + b_DG + b_GS + x.\n\nAnd n(S) = 562 = a_S + b_DS + b_GS + x.\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\n1) 195 = a_D + b_DG + b_DS + x\n\n2) 367 = a_G + b_DG + b_GS + x\n\n3) 562 = a_S + b_DS + b_GS + x\n\nAnd we also have:\n\na = a_D + a_G + a_S = 437\n\nb = b_DG + b_DS + b_GS = 234\n\nAnd d + a + b + c = 900 \u2192 d = 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x.\n\nBut wait, d cannot be negative, so x must be less than 229.\n\nNow, let's sum up the equations 1, 2, and 3.\n\nSum = 195 + 367 + 562 = (a_D + a_G + a_S) + (b_DG + b_DS + b_GS) + 3x.\n\nBecause each of the terms b_DG, b_DS, b_GS appears twice in the sum of equations 1, 2, 3, right?\n\nWait, let me see. Equation 1: a_D + b_DG + b_DS + x\n\nEquation 2: a_G + b_DG + b_GS + x\n\nEquation 3: a_S + b_DS + b_GS + x\n\nSumming them:\n\n(a_D + a_G + a_S) + (b_DG + b_DS + b_GS) + (b_DG + b_DS + b_GS) + 3x.\n\nWait, no, let's compute term by term.\n\nSum of left sides: 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSum of right sides: (a_D + b_DG + b_DS + x) + (a_G + b_DG + b_GS + x) + (a_S + b_DS + b_GS + x)\n\n= (a_D + a_G + a_S) + (b_DG + b_DG) + (b_DS + b_DS) + (b_GS + b_GS) + 3x.\n\nSo, that's (a) + 2*(b_DG + b_DS + b_GS) + 3x.\n\nBut a = 437, and b = 234, so b_DG + b_DS + b_GS = 234.\n\nSo, sum of right sides = 437 + 2*(234) + 3x = 437 + 468 + 3x = 905 + 3x.\n\nBut the sum of left sides is 1124.\n\nSo, 905 + 3x = 1124 \u2192 3x = 1124 - 905 = 219 \u2192 x = 73.\n\nSo, the number of people who own all four items is 73.\n\nWait, let me double-check that math.\n\nSum of left sides: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124. Hmm, 195 + 367 is actually 562? Wait, 195 + 367 is 562? Let me compute: 195 + 367: 195+300=495, 495+67=562. Yes. Then 562 + 562 = 1124? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the sum is 195 + 367 + 562. Let me compute that correctly.\n\n195 + 367: 195+300=495, 495+67=562.\n\n562 + 562 = 1124. Yes, correct.\n\nSum of right sides: a + 2b + 3x.\n\na=437, b=234.\n\nSo, 437 + 2*234 = 437 + 468 = 905.\n\nThen 905 + 3x = 1124 \u2192 3x=219 \u2192 x=73.\n\nSo, x is 73. So, the number of residents who own all four is 73.\n\nLet me just confirm if this makes sense with the other constraints.\n\nWe can also find d, which is the number of people who own only C.\n\nd = 900 - a - b - c = 900 - 437 - 234 -73.\n\nLet me compute: 437 + 234 = 671. 671 + 73 = 744. 900 -744=156.\n\nSo, d=156.\n\nNow, let's see if that makes sense with the individual counts.\n\nFor example, n(D) = a_D + b_DG + b_DS + x.\n\nBut a_D is the number of people with exactly C and D, which is part of a=437.\n\nSimilarly, a_D + a_G + a_S =437.\n\nSo, a_D = number of people with only C and D.\n\nSimilarly, a_G and a_S.\n\nBut perhaps let me compute the total number of people owning each item.\n\nn(D) = a_D + b_DG + b_DS + x.\n\nSimilarly, n(G) = a_G + b_DG + b_GS + x.\n\nn(S) = a_S + b_DS + b_GS + x.\n\nWe can write:\n\nn(D) = (a_D) + (b_DG + b_DS) + x.\n\nBut a_D is part of a, so a_D + a_G + a_S =437.\n\nWait, maybe we can compute a_D, a_G, a_S.\n\nBut maybe it's not necessary since we've already found x.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me see if the numbers add up.\n\nWe have x=73, so let's see:\n\nn(D) = 195 = a_D + b_DG + b_DS +73.\n\nSo, a_D + b_DG + b_DS = 195 -73=122.\n\nSimilarly, n(G)=367 =a_G + b_DG + b_GS +73 \u2192 a_G + b_DG + b_GS=367-73=294.\n\nn(S)=562 =a_S + b_DS + b_GS +73 \u2192 a_S + b_DS + b_GS=562-73=489.\n\nWe also know that:\n\na = a_D + a_G + a_S =437.\n\nb = b_DG + b_DS + b_GS =234.\n\nLet me write down the equations:\n\n1) a_D + b_DG + b_DS =122.\n\n2) a_G + b_DG + b_GS=294.\n\n3) a_S + b_DS + b_GS=489.\n\n4) a_D + a_G + a_S=437.\n\n5) b_DG + b_DS + b_GS=234.\n\nWe can try to solve these equations.\n\nLet me denote equation 5 as: b_DG + b_DS + b_GS=234.\n\nFrom equation 1: a_D =122 - b_DG - b_DS.\n\nFrom equation 2: a_G=294 - b_DG - b_GS.\n\nFrom equation 3: a_S=489 - b_DS - b_GS.\n\nNow, substitute a_D, a_G, a_S into equation 4:\n\n(122 - b_DG - b_DS) + (294 - b_DG - b_GS) + (489 - b_DS - b_GS) =437.\n\nSimplify:\n\n122 +294 +489 - (b_DG + b_DG) - (b_DS + b_DS) - (b_GS + b_GS) =437.\n\nCompute 122+294=416; 416+489=905.\n\nSo, 905 - 2b_DG - 2b_DS -2b_GS =437.\n\nThen, 2(b_DG + b_DS + b_GS) =905 -437=468.\n\nSo, 2*234=468, which is correct because b=234.\n\nSo, this checks out. Therefore, our value of x=73 is consistent.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of residents in Aimeville who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Given that every resident owns the candy hearts, we analyze the ownership of the other three items using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nWe define:\n- \\( a \\) = number of residents owning exactly two items (including candy hearts) = 437.\n- \\( b \\) = number of residents owning exactly three items (including candy hearts) = 234.\n- \\( c \\) = number of residents owning all four items (including candy hearts) = \\( x \\) (to be found).\n- \\( d \\) = number of residents owning only candy hearts.\n\nThe total number of residents is:\n\\[\nd + a + b + c = 900\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\nd = 900 - (a + b + c) = 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 229 - x\n\\]\n\nUsing the given counts of ownership for each item:\n\\[\nn(D) = 195 = a_D + b_{DG} + b_{DS} + x\n\\]\n\\[\nn(G) = 367 = a_G + b_{DG} + b_{GS} + x\n\\]\n\\[\nn(S) = 562 = a_S + b_{DS} + b_{GS} + x\n\\]\n\nSumming these equations:\n\\[\n195 + 367 + 562 = (a_D + a_G + a_S) + 2(b_{DG} + b_{DS} + b_{GS}) + 3x\n\\]\n\\[\n1124 = 437 + 2(234) + 3x\n\\]\n\\[\n1124 = 437 + 468 + 3x\n\\]\n\\[\n1124 = 905 + 3x\n\\]\n\\[\n3x = 219 \\implies x = 73\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four items is \\( \\boxed{73} \\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and what they own. I need to find out how many own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me jot down the numbers given. There are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's one thing everyone has. Then, the numbers for the other three are: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. \n\nWait, so the candy hearts are universal. So every resident has at least that. Now, the other three items are optional. But some people might own two, three, or all four of these things. The problem also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. But I'm supposed to find how many own all four. \n\nI remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion in set theory. Maybe that applies here. Let me recall how that works. The inclusion-exclusion principle helps calculate the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the three-set intersections, and so on.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the problem gives me the number of people owning exactly two and exactly three items, not the overlaps. So maybe I can use that information instead.\n\nLet me think about the formula for the total number of elements in the union of four sets. Wait, but since everyone has at least the candy hearts, the total number of residents is actually the same as the union of the four sets. Because without the candy hearts, the other sets are subsets of the total. But since all have candy hearts, the total is 900.\n\nWait, no, actually, the four items are diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). So each resident has C for sure. So the four sets are D, G, S, and C, where C is the universal set because everyone has it. So the union of D, G, S, and C is C itself, which has 900 elements.\n\nBut I'm more interested in the overlaps between D, G, S, and C. Hmm, maybe I should model this using a Venn diagram with four sets, but that can get complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to model this with the information given about exactly two and exactly three items. Let me think. Let me denote:\n\n- Let a be the number of people who own exactly one item.\n- Let b be the number who own exactly two.\n- Let c be the number who own exactly three.\n- Let d be the number who own all four.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that 437 own exactly two, so b=437, and 234 own exactly three, so c=234. I'm to find d.\n\nWait, but since everyone has at least the candy hearts, which is one item. So the total number of residents is the sum of people owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four items. So total = a + b + c + d = 900.\n\nBut I don't know a yet. Hmm. Maybe I can find a by using the inclusion-exclusion principle on the other three items, D, G, S, and then relate that to the total.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me consider the counts for D, G, S. Each of these counts includes those who own just that item, those who own that item plus another, and so on.\n\nSo, the number of people owning D is 195. This includes people who own only D, those who own D and another item, those who own D and two others, and those who own all four.\n\nSimilarly for G (367) and S (562).\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Only D: a_D\n- Only G: a_G\n- Only S: a_S\n- Only C: a_C (but since everyone has C, this would be a_C = 0? Wait, no. Wait, C is the candy hearts, which everyone has, so actually, a_C is the number of people who have only C and nothing else. But that can't be, because the problem says each owns a bag of candy hearts, but they might have other things too. So the number of people who own only C is a_C, and the rest own C plus other items.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to model the problem more systematically.\n\nEach resident has at least C (candy hearts). So the four items are C, D, G, S.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- |C| = 900 (since everyone has it)\n- |D| = 195\n- |G| = 367\n- |S| = 562\n\nAlso given:\n\n- Number of people with exactly two items: 437 (b)\n- Number with exactly three items: 234 (c)\n- Number with exactly four items: d (to find)\n- Number with exactly one item: a.\n\nSo, total = a + b + c + d = 900.\n\nBut how to find a, b, c, d? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle for the three sets D, G, S. Because C is already included in all of them.\n\nWait, no, because C is the universal set here. So maybe the counts for D, G, S include those who also have C and possibly others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the total number of \"item ownerships\" across all residents. Each resident owns at least one item (C) and possibly more.\n\nSo, the total number of item ownerships is equal to the sum of the individual counts:\n\nTotal ownerships = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - (number of people owning exactly two items) * 2 - (number owning exactly three items) * 3 - (number owning all four) *4 + ... Wait, no, perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, the total number of item ownerships can be calculated by considering each resident and how many items they own. So for each resident, count the number of items they own, and sum all those counts.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- a: number of residents owning exactly 1 item (only C)\n- b: exactly 2 items (C plus one other)\n- c: exactly 3 items (C plus two others)\n- d: exactly 4 items (all four)\n\nWait, but the problem says that 437 own exactly two of these things, but does that include C? Or is it exactly two among D, G, S? Hmm, the problem says \"exactly two of these things\", which probably refers to all four. Wait, the problem says: \"437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\" So, \"these things\" refers to diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, exactly two includes C. So, for example, someone who owns C and D but nothing else would be in the exactly two category.\n\nWait, that changes things. So the 437 is the number of people who own exactly two of the four items, including C. Similarly, 234 own exactly three of the four, including C.\n\nSo, to model this, we can think of:\n\nTotal residents = a (exactly 1) + b (exactly 2) + c (exactly 3) + d (exactly 4) = 900.\n\nBut in this problem, we know that every resident owns C, so the \"exactly 1\" category is those who only own C. The \"exactly 2\" category includes those who own C plus one other, and so on.\n\nSo, given that, let me reorganize:\n\na = number of people owning exactly C (so only C) = 900 - (b + c + d), because the rest own more than one item.\n\nWait, no, because the total is a + b + c + d = 900.\n\nWait, but a is the number of people who own exactly 1 item, which is C only. So a = number of people owning only C.\n\nBut since all residents have C, the only way someone has exactly one item is if they have only C and nothing else. So a = number of people with only C.\n\nNow, the counts for D, G, S are the sum of all people who own those items, regardless of how many other items they have. So:\n\n|D| = a_D (only D) + (number of people with D and one other) + (number with D and two others) + d.\n\nWait, but in our setup, the people with D are either in the exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 categories. Because a is only C, so a_D is zero, because if someone has D, they must have at least C and D, so they are in the exactly 2, 3, or 4 categories.\n\nWait, no, because a is the number of people who have exactly C, so a_D is the number of people who have exactly D and C, but no other items. So if someone has exactly two items, one of which is D, then they are in the exactly two category.\n\nSo, let me model the counts:\n\nFor D: |D| = (number of people with exactly D and C) + (number with D, C, and one more item) + (number with all four items).\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let x be the number of people who have exactly C and D (so exactly two items, D and C). Similarly, y for C and G, z for C and S.\n- Let p be the number of people who have exactly C, D, and G (exactly three items). Similarly, q for C, D, S; r for C, G, S.\n- Let d be the number of people with all four items.\n\nWait, but this might get complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use the inclusion-exclusion principle for the three sets D, G, S, considering that all residents have C.\n\nWait, but since everyone has C, maybe the counts for D, G, S can be thought of as the number of people who have D (and possibly others, including C), etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the problem in terms of the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets, D, G, S, and then relate that to the given numbers.\n\nLet me try that. The inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nBut since everyone has C, which is the universal set, the union |D \u222a G \u222a S| is equal to the number of people who have at least one of D, G, or S. But since C is universal, everyone has C, but some have D, G, or S as well.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which is C. So, the total number of people is 900, each with C. The number of people who have D is 195, G is 367, S is 562.\n\nWait, but |D \u222a G \u222a S| would represent the number of people who have at least one of D, G, or S. But since C is universal, the number of people without D, G, or S is equal to the number of people who have only C. That is, a = number of people with only C.\n\nSo, |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - a.\n\nBut from inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nSo, 900 - a = 195 + 367 + 562 - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nLet me calculate the sum of |D| + |G| + |S|: 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 gives 1124.\n\nSo,\n\n900 - a = 1124 - (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|) + |D\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nBut I don't know |D\u2229G|, |D\u2229S|, |G\u2229S|, or |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nBut perhaps I can express these intersections in terms of the given numbers: the number of people with exactly two and exactly three items.\n\nWait, because the intersections |D\u2229G|, |D\u2229S|, |G\u2229S| include people who have exactly two of D, G, S (plus C), and those who have all three (plus C). So, for example, |D\u2229G| includes the people who have exactly D, G, and C (exactly two items), and those who have D, G, S, and C (exactly three items), plus those who have all four (D, G, S, C).\n\nWait, no, actually, |D\u2229G| is the number of people who have both D and G, regardless of other items. So it includes:\n\n- People who have exactly D, G, and C (exactly two items).\n- People who have D, G, and one more item (so exactly three items: D, G, and S, for example).\n- People who have all four items.\n\nSo, |D\u2229G| = (number with exactly D, G, C) + (number with exactly D, G, S, C) + (number with all four items).\n\nSimilarly for the other intersections.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I can find |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| in terms of the given numbers.\n\nWait, let me think about the number of people who own exactly two items. Each of these people contributes to exactly one of the pairwise intersections. For example, someone who owns exactly C and D contributes to |D\u2229G|? No, wait. No, if they own exactly C and D, they don't own G or S, so they are only in |D\u2229C|, but since C is universal, |D\u2229C| is just |D|, which includes all D owners.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- The number of people with exactly two items is 437. Each of these contributes to exactly one pairwise intersection. For example, someone with exactly C and D contributes to |D\u2229C|, which is |D|, but since C is universal, |D\u2229C| is just |D|, which includes all D owners, including those who have more than two items. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model the overlaps in terms of the exact counts. Let me denote:\n\n- Let\u2019s say the number of people who own exactly two items is 437, which includes all possible pairs among the four items. But since C is always included, the pairs are:\n\nC and D\n\nC and G\n\nC and S\n\nD and G\n\nD and S\n\nG and S\n\nWait, but that's six possible pairs. But the problem says 437 own exactly two things, so these could be any of the possible pairs.\n\nBut considering that each person owns at least C, the possible pairs are C with D, C with G, C with S, D with G, D with S, and G with S. But wait, no, because if someone owns exactly two items, they must include C plus one other, or any two of the other three.\n\nWait, no, because if someone owns exactly two items, they could have C and D, or C and G, or C and S, or D and G, or D and S, or G and S. So six possible pairs.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify which pairs, so perhaps I can't directly find the individual overlaps. Hmm, this is getting tricky.\n\nWait, but maybe I can find the sum of all pairwise intersections. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s say S1 = |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|.\n\nEach of these terms includes people who have exactly two items (including C) and those who have three or four items.\n\nBut from the problem, the number of people with exactly two items is 437. Each of these people is in exactly one of the pairwise intersections. For example, someone with exactly C and D is in |D\u2229C|, but since C is universal, |D\u2229C| is just |D|. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express S1 in terms of the number of people with exactly two items and exactly three items.\n\nWait, let me think about it. The sum of all pairwise intersections S1 = |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|.\n\nEach of these intersections includes:\n\n- The number of people with exactly two items that are in that pair (e.g., |D\u2229G| includes those with exactly D and G, which would be exactly two items: D, G, and C? Wait, no, because if someone has exactly D and G, they have C as well, so that's three items, right? Wait, no, if someone has exactly two items, and those are D and G, but since they have C, that's three items. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: if a person has exactly two items, they must have exactly two of the four: C, D, G, S. But since they have C, the other item must be one of D, G, S. So, for example, someone with exactly two items could have C and D, but not G or S. Similarly, C and G, C and S, D and G, D and S, or G and S.\n\nWait, but if someone has exactly two items, and one of them is D, then the other must be C. Because if they have D and G, then they have C as well, making it three items, which would be in the exactly three category. So, perhaps the only possible exactly two-item owners are those who have C and exactly one other item. Because if they have two other items besides C, that would make three items in total, which falls into the exactly three category.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if someone has C and two others, say D and G, then that's three items, so they are in the exactly three category, not exactly two. So, the exactly two-item owners are those who have C plus exactly one other item. So, the possible exactly two-item categories are:\n\n- C and D only\n\n- C and G only\n\n- C and S only\n\nSo, the 437 people who own exactly two items are distributed among these three categories.\n\nSimilarly, the 234 people who own exactly three items must have C plus two other items. So, the possible exactly three-item categories are:\n\n- C, D, G\n\n- C, D, S\n\n- C, G, S\n\nAnd the exactly four-item category is all four: C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, with this in mind, let me denote:\n\nLet x = number of people with exactly C and D (two items)\n\ny = number of people with exactly C and G (two items)\n\nz = number of people with exactly C and S (two items)\n\nSo, x + y + z = 437.\n\nSimilarly, let p = number of people with exactly C, D, G (three items)\n\nq = number of people with exactly C, D, S (three items)\n\nr = number of people with exactly C, G, S (three items)\n\nSo, p + q + r = 234.\n\nAnd let d = number of people with all four items (C, D, G, S).\n\nNow, the total number of people is:\n\na (only C) + x + y + z (exactly two) + p + q + r (exactly three) + d (exactly four) = 900.\n\nSo, a + 437 + 234 + d = 900.\n\nBut a is the number of people who have only C, so a = 900 - (437 + 234 + d) = 900 - 671 - d = 229 - d.\n\nWait, but a can't be negative, so d must be less than or equal to 229.\n\nNow, let's look at the counts for D, G, S.\n\nThe number of people who own D is 195, which includes:\n\n- x (C and D)\n\n- p (C, D, G)\n\n- q (C, D, S)\n\n- d (all four)\n\nSo,\n\nx + p + q + d = 195.\n\nSimilarly, for G:\n\ny + p + r + d = 367.\n\nFor S:\n\nz + q + r + d = 562.\n\nSo, now we have three equations:\n\n1. x + p + q + d = 195.\n\n2. y + p + r + d = 367.\n\n3. z + q + r + d = 562.\n\nWe also have:\n\nx + y + z = 437.\n\np + q + r = 234.\n\nAnd a = 229 - d.\n\nOur goal is to find d.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express x, y, z in terms of the other variables.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = 195 - p - q - d.\n\nFrom equation 2: y = 367 - p - r - d.\n\nFrom equation 3: z = 562 - q - r - d.\n\nNow, sum x + y + z:\n\nx + y + z = (195 - p - q - d) + (367 - p - r - d) + (562 - q - r - d)\n\n= 195 + 367 + 562 - 2p - 2q - 2r - 3d\n\n= 1124 - 2(p + q + r) - 3d.\n\nBut we know x + y + z = 437, and p + q + r = 234.\n\nSo,\n\n437 = 1124 - 2*(234) - 3d.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n2*(234) = 468.\n\nSo,\n\n437 = 1124 - 468 - 3d.\n\n1124 - 468 is 656.\n\nSo,\n\n437 = 656 - 3d.\n\nSubtract 437 from both sides:\n\n0 = 656 - 3d - 437\n\n0 = 219 - 3d.\n\nSo,\n\n3d = 219.\n\nd = 73.\n\nWait, that seems like a possible answer. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nSo, d = 73.\n\nThen, let's compute a = 229 - d = 229 -73 = 156.\n\nNow, let's check if all the numbers add up correctly.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nx = 195 - p - q - 73.\n\nBut p + q + r =234.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find p, q, r.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I can check the counts.\n\nLet me compute the total number of D owners:\n\nx + p + q + d = (195 - p - q -73) + p + q +73 = 195.\n\nWhich checks out.\n\nSimilarly for G:\n\ny + p + r + d = (367 - p - r -73) + p + r +73 = 367.\n\nAnd for S:\n\nz + q + r + d = (562 - q - r -73) + q + r +73 =562.\n\nSo the equations hold.\n\nThus, the number of people who own all four items is 73.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and what they own. I need to find out how many own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me jot down the numbers given. There are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's one thing everyone has. Then, the numbers for the other three are: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. \n\nWait, so the candy hearts are universal. So every resident has at least that. Now, the other three items are optional. But some people might own two, three, or all four of these things. The problem also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. But I'm supposed to find how many own all four. \n\nI remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion in set theory. Maybe that applies here. Let me recall how that works. The inclusion-exclusion principle helps calculate the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the three-set intersections, and so on.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the problem gives me the number of people owning exactly two and exactly three items, not the overlaps. So maybe I can use that information instead.\n\nLet me think about the formula for the total number of elements in the union of four sets. Wait, but since everyone has at least the candy hearts, the total number of residents is actually the same as the union of the four sets. Because without the candy hearts, the other sets are subsets of the total. But since all have candy hearts, the total is 900.\n\nWait, no, actually, the four items are diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). So each resident has C for sure. So the four sets are D, G, S, and C, where C is the universal set because everyone has it. So the union of D, G, S, and C is C itself, which has 900 elements.\n\nBut I'm more interested in the overlaps between D, G, S, and C. Hmm, maybe I should model this using a Venn diagram with four sets, but that can get complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to model this with the information given about exactly two and exactly three items. Let me think. Let me denote:\n\n- Let a be the number of people who own exactly one item.\n- Let b be the number who own exactly two.\n- Let c be the number who own exactly three.\n- Let d be the number who own all four.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that 437 own exactly two, so b=437, and 234 own exactly three, so c=234. I'm to find d.\n\nWait, but since everyone has at least the candy hearts, which is one item. So the total number of residents is the sum of people owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four items. So total = a + b + c + d = 900.\n\nBut I don't know a yet. Hmm. Maybe I can find a by using the inclusion-exclusion principle on the other three items, D, G, S, and then relate that to the total.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me consider the counts for D, G, S. Each of these counts includes those who own just that item, those who own that item plus another, and so on.\n\nSo, the number of people owning D is 195. This includes people who own only D, those who own D and another item, those who own D and two others, and those who own all four.\n\nSimilarly for G (367) and S (562).\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Only D: a_D\n- Only G: a_G\n- Only S: a_S\n- Only C: a_C (but since everyone has C, this would be a_C = 0? Wait, no. Wait, C is the candy hearts, which everyone has, so actually, a_C is the number of people who have only C and nothing else. But that can't be, because the problem says each owns a bag of candy hearts, but they might have other things too. So the number of people who own only C is a_C, and the rest own C plus other items.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to model the problem more systematically.\n\nEach resident has at least C (candy hearts). So the four items are C, D, G, S.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- |C| = 900 (since everyone has it)\n- |D| = 195\n- |G| = 367\n- |S| = 562\n\nAlso given:\n\n- Number of people with exactly two items: 437 (b)\n- Number with exactly three items: 234 (c)\n- Number with exactly four items: d (to find)\n- Number with exactly one item: a.\n\nSo, total = a + b + c + d = 900.\n\nBut how to find a, b, c, d? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle for the three sets D, G, S. Because C is already included in all of them.\n\nWait, no, because C is the universal set here. So maybe the counts for D, G, S include those who also have C and possibly others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the total number of \"item ownerships\" across all residents. Each resident owns at least one item (C) and possibly more.\n\nSo, the total number of item ownerships is equal to the sum of the individual counts:\n\nTotal ownerships = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - (number of people owning exactly two items) * 2 - (number owning exactly three items) * 3 - (number owning all four) *4 + ... Wait, no, perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, the total number of item ownerships can be calculated by considering each resident and how many items they own. So for each resident, count the number of items they own, and sum all those counts.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- a: number of residents owning exactly 1 item (only C)\n- b: exactly 2 items (C plus one other)\n- c: exactly 3 items (C plus two others)\n- d: exactly 4 items (all four)\n\nWait, but the problem says that 437 own exactly two of these things, but does that include C? Or is it exactly two among D, G, S? Hmm, the problem says \"exactly two of these things\", which probably refers to all four. Wait, the problem says: \"437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\" So, \"these things\" refers to diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, exactly two includes C. So, for example, someone who owns C and D but nothing else would be in the exactly two category.\n\nWait, that changes things. So the 437 is the number of people who own exactly two of the four items, including C. Similarly, 234 own exactly three of the four, including C.\n\nSo, to model this, we can think of:\n\nTotal residents = a (exactly 1) + b (exactly 2) + c (exactly 3) + d (exactly 4) = 900.\n\nBut in this problem, we know that every resident owns C, so the \"exactly 1\" category is those who only own C. The \"exactly 2\" category includes those who own C plus one other, and so on.\n\nSo, given that, let me reorganize:\n\na = number of people owning exactly C (so only C) = 900 - (b + c + d), because the rest own more than one item.\n\nWait, no, because the total is a + b + c + d = 900.\n\nWait, but a is the number of people who own exactly 1 item, which is C only. So a = number of people owning only C.\n\nBut since all residents have C, the only way someone has exactly one item is if they have only C and nothing else. So a = number of people with only C.\n\nNow, the counts for D, G, S are the sum of all people who own those items, regardless of how many other items they have. So:\n\n|D| = a_D (only D) + (number of people with D and one other) + (number with D and two others) + d.\n\nWait, but in our setup, the people with D are either in the exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 categories. Because a is only C, so a_D is zero, because if someone has D, they must have at least C and D, so they are in the exactly 2, 3, or 4 categories.\n\nWait, no, because a is the number of people who have exactly C, so a_D is the number of people who have exactly D and C, but no other items. So if someone has exactly two items, one of which is D, then they are in the exactly two category.\n\nSo, let me model the counts:\n\nFor D: |D| = (number of people with exactly D and C) + (number with D, C, and one more item) + (number with all four items).\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let x be the number of people who have exactly C and D (so exactly two items, D and C). Similarly, y for C and G, z for C and S.\n- Let p be the number of people who have exactly C, D, and G (exactly three items). Similarly, q for C, D, S; r for C, G, S.\n- Let d be the number of people with all four items.\n\nWait, but this might get complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use the inclusion-exclusion principle for the three sets D, G, S, considering that all residents have C.\n\nWait, but since everyone has C, maybe the counts for D, G, S can be thought of as the number of people who have D (and possibly others, including C), etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the problem in terms of the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets, D, G, S, and then relate that to the given numbers.\n\nLet me try that. The inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nBut since everyone has C, which is the universal set, the union |D \u222a G \u222a S| is equal to the number of people who have at least one of D, G, or S. But since C is universal, everyone has C, but some have D, G, or S as well.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which is C. So, the total number of people is 900, each with C. The number of people who have D is 195, G is 367, S is 562.\n\nWait, but |D \u222a G \u222a S| would represent the number of people who have at least one of D, G, or S. But since C is universal, the number of people without D, G, or S is equal to the number of people who have only C. That is, a = number of people with only C.\n\nSo, |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - a.\n\nBut from inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nSo, 900 - a = 195 + 367 + 562 - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nLet me calculate the sum of |D| + |G| + |S|: 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 gives 1124.\n\nSo,\n\n900 - a = 1124 - (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|) + |D\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nBut I don't know |D\u2229G|, |D\u2229S|, |G\u2229S|, or |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nBut perhaps I can express these intersections in terms of the given numbers: the number of people with exactly two and exactly three items.\n\nWait, because the intersections |D\u2229G|, |D\u2229S|, |G\u2229S| include people who have exactly two of D, G, S (plus C), and those who have all three (plus C). So, for example, |D\u2229G| includes the people who have exactly D, G, and C (exactly two items), and those who have D, G, S, and C (exactly three items), plus those who have all four (D, G, S, C).\n\nWait, no, actually, |D\u2229G| is the number of people who have both D and G, regardless of other items. So it includes:\n\n- People who have exactly D, G, and C (exactly two items).\n- People who have D, G, and one more item (so exactly three items: D, G, and S, for example).\n- People who have all four items.\n\nSo, |D\u2229G| = (number with exactly D, G, C) + (number with exactly D, G, S, C) + (number with all four items).\n\nSimilarly for the other intersections.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I can find |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| in terms of the given numbers.\n\nWait, let me think about the number of people who own exactly two items. Each of these people contributes to exactly one of the pairwise intersections. For example, someone who owns exactly C and D contributes to |D\u2229G|? No, wait. No, if they own exactly C and D, they don't own G or S, so they are only in |D\u2229C|, but since C is universal, |D\u2229C| is just |D|, which includes all D owners.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- The number of people with exactly two items is 437. Each of these contributes to exactly one pairwise intersection. For example, someone with exactly C and D contributes to |D\u2229C|, which is |D|, but since C is universal, |D\u2229C| is just |D|, which includes all D owners, including those who have more than two items. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model the overlaps in terms of the exact counts. Let me denote:\n\n- Let\u2019s say the number of people who own exactly two items is 437, which includes all possible pairs among the four items. But since C is always included, the pairs are:\n\nC and D\n\nC and G\n\nC and S\n\nD and G\n\nD and S\n\nG and S\n\nWait, but that's six possible pairs. But the problem says 437 own exactly two things, so these could be any of the possible pairs.\n\nBut considering that each person owns at least C, the possible pairs are C with D, C with G, C with S, D with G, D with S, and G with S. But wait, no, because if someone owns exactly two items, they must include C plus one other, or any two of the other three.\n\nWait, no, because if someone owns exactly two items, they could have C and D, or C and G, or C and S, or D and G, or D and S, or G and S. So six possible pairs.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify which pairs, so perhaps I can't directly find the individual overlaps. Hmm, this is getting tricky.\n\nWait, but maybe I can find the sum of all pairwise intersections. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s say S1 = |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|.\n\nEach of these terms includes people who have exactly two items (including C) and those who have three or four items.\n\nBut from the problem, the number of people with exactly two items is 437. Each of these people is in exactly one of the pairwise intersections. For example, someone with exactly C and D is in |D\u2229C|, but since C is universal, |D\u2229C| is just |D|. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express S1 in terms of the number of people with exactly two items and exactly three items.\n\nWait, let me think about it. The sum of all pairwise intersections S1 = |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|.\n\nEach of these intersections includes:\n\n- The number of people with exactly two items that are in that pair (e.g., |D\u2229G| includes those with exactly D and G, which would be exactly two items: D, G, and C? Wait, no, because if someone has exactly D and G, they have C as well, so that's three items, right? Wait, no, if someone has exactly two items, and those are D and G, but since they have C, that's three items. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: if a person has exactly two items, they must have exactly two of the four: C, D, G, S. But since they have C, the other item must be one of D, G, S. So, for example, someone with exactly two items could have C and D, but not G or S. Similarly, C and G, C and S, D and G, D and S, or G and S.\n\nWait, but if someone has exactly two items, and one of them is D, then the other must be C. Because if they have D and G, then they have C as well, making it three items, which would be in the exactly three category. So, perhaps the only possible exactly two-item owners are those who have C and exactly one other item. Because if they have two other items besides C, that would make three items in total, which falls into the exactly three category.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if someone has C and two others, say D and G, then that's three items, so they are in the exactly three category, not exactly two. So, the exactly two-item owners are those who have C plus exactly one other item. So, the possible exactly two-item categories are:\n\n- C and D only\n\n- C and G only\n\n- C and S only\n\nSo, the 437 people who own exactly two items are distributed among these three categories.\n\nSimilarly, the 234 people who own exactly three items must have C plus two other items. So, the possible exactly three-item categories are:\n\n- C, D, G\n\n- C, D, S\n\n- C, G, S\n\nAnd the exactly four-item category is all four: C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, with this in mind, let me denote:\n\nLet x = number of people with exactly C and D (two items)\n\ny = number of people with exactly C and G (two items)\n\nz = number of people with exactly C and S (two items)\n\nSo, x + y + z = 437.\n\nSimilarly, let p = number of people with exactly C, D, G (three items)\n\nq = number of people with exactly C, D, S (three items)\n\nr = number of people with exactly C, G, S (three items)\n\nSo, p + q + r = 234.\n\nAnd let d = number of people with all four items (C, D, G, S).\n\nNow, the total number of people is:\n\na (only C) + x + y + z (exactly two) + p + q + r (exactly three) + d (exactly four) = 900.\n\nSo, a + 437 + 234 + d = 900.\n\nBut a is the number of people who have only C, so a = 900 - (437 + 234 + d) = 900 - 671 - d = 229 - d.\n\nWait, but a can't be negative, so d must be less than or equal to 229.\n\nNow, let's look at the counts for D, G, S.\n\nThe number of people who own D is 195, which includes:\n\n- x (C and D)\n\n- p (C, D, G)\n\n- q (C, D, S)\n\n- d (all four)\n\nSo,\n\nx + p + q + d = 195.\n\nSimilarly, for G:\n\ny + p + r + d = 367.\n\nFor S:\n\nz + q + r + d = 562.\n\nSo, now we have three equations:\n\n1. x + p + q + d = 195.\n\n2. y + p + r + d = 367.\n\n3. z + q + r + d = 562.\n\nWe also have:\n\nx + y + z = 437.\n\np + q + r = 234.\n\nAnd a = 229 - d.\n\nOur goal is to find d.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express x, y, z in terms of the other variables.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = 195 - p - q - d.\n\nFrom equation 2: y = 367 - p - r - d.\n\nFrom equation 3: z = 562 - q - r - d.\n\nNow, sum x + y + z:\n\nx + y + z = (195 - p - q - d) + (367 - p - r - d) + (562 - q - r - d)\n\n= 195 + 367 + 562 - 2p - 2q - 2r - 3d\n\n= 1124 - 2(p + q + r) - 3d.\n\nBut we know x + y + z = 437, and p + q + r = 234.\n\nSo,\n\n437 = 1124 - 2*(234) - 3d.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n2*(234) = 468.\n\nSo,\n\n437 = 1124 - 468 - 3d.\n\n1124 - 468 is 656.\n\nSo,\n\n437 = 656 - 3d.\n\nSubtract 437 from both sides:\n\n0 = 656 - 3d - 437\n\n0 = 219 - 3d.\n\nSo,\n\n3d = 219.\n\nd = 73.\n\nWait, that seems like a possible answer. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nSo, d = 73.\n\nThen, let's compute a = 229 - d = 229 -73 = 156.\n\nNow, let's check if all the numbers add up correctly.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nx = 195 - p - q - 73.\n\nBut p + q + r =234.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find p, q, r.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I can check the counts.\n\nLet me compute the total number of D owners:\n\nx + p + q + d = (195 - p - q -73) + p + q +73 = 195.\n\nWhich checks out.\n\nSimilarly for G:\n\ny + p + r + d = (367 - p - r -73) + p + r +73 = 367.\n\nAnd for S:\n\nz + q + r + d = (562 - q - r -73) + q + r +73 =562.\n\nSo the equations hold.\n\nThus, the number of people who own all four items is 73.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given data about the number of residents owning exactly two or three items.\n\nLet:\n- \\( d \\) be the number of residents who own all four items.\n- \\( x, y, z \\) be the number of residents who own exactly two items: \\( \\{C, D\\}, \\{C, G\\}, \\{C, S\\} \\), respectively.\n- \\( p, q, r \\) be the number of residents who own exactly three items: \\( \\{C, D, G\\}, \\{C, D, S\\}, \\{C, G, S\\} \\), respectively.\n- \\( a \\) be the number of residents who own only \\( C \\).\n\nFrom the problem:\n- Total residents: \\( a + x + y + z + p + q + r + d = 900 \\).\n- Residents owning exactly two items: \\( x + y + z = 437 \\).\n- Residents owning exactly three items: \\( p + q + r = 234 \\).\n\nThus, \\( a = 900 - (x + y + z + p + q + r + d) = 900 - (437 + 234 + d) = 229 - d \\).\n\nUsing the counts for \\( D, G, S \\):\n1. \\( x + p + q + d = 195 \\) (owners of \\( D \\)).\n2. \\( y + p + r + d = 367 \\) (owners of \\( G \\)).\n3. \\( z + q + r + d = 562 \\) (owners of \\( S \\)).\n\nSumming equations 1, 2, and 3:\n\\[\n(x + y + z) + 2(p + q + r) + 3d = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( x + y + z = 437 \\) and \\( p + q + r = 234 \\):\n\\[\n437 + 2(234) + 3d = 1124.\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n437 + 468 + 3d = 1124 \\implies 905 + 3d = 1124 \\implies 3d = 219 \\implies d = 73.\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four items is \\(\\boxed{73}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to parse it step by step. Hmm, there are 900 residents total. Each person owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's one thing everyone has. Then there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 respectively. \n\nWait, and then there's information about how many own exactly two things and exactly three things. Specifically, 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four items, which includes the candy hearts and the other three. \n\nSo, this seems like a problem involving sets and their overlaps. I remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall that. The formula for the union of four sets... Hmm, but since we have some information about exact overlaps, maybe I can approach it differently.\n\nWait, the formula for the union of n sets is the sum of the sizes minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the sum of all triple-wise intersections, and so on, alternating signs. But since we know exactly how many are in exactly two, exactly three, and all four, maybe I can model this with a Venn diagram approach.\n\nLet me denote:\n- A = set of people who own a diamond ring.\n- B = set of people who own a set of golf clubs.\n- C = set of people who own a garden spade.\n- D = set of people who own a bag of candy hearts. But wait, D is everyone because everyone has a candy heart. So D is the universal set here, right? So every resident is in D.\n\nBut since everyone is in D, the problem is about the overlaps of A, B, C within D. So, perhaps it's better to model this as three sets (A, B, C) within the universal set D.\n\nBut the problem is about four items, but since D is universal, maybe we can treat it as three sets and use the inclusion-exclusion principle accordingly.\n\nWait, but the question is about all four. So, the number of people who own all four is the same as the number who own A, B, C, and D, but since D is everyone, that's just the number of people who own all three of A, B, C. Oh, wait, but the problem says 234 own exactly three of these things. So, that would include owning A, B, C, and D, which is everyone. Wait, no, because D is always there, so when someone owns exactly three, that would mean they own A, B, C, but since D is included, that would actually make it four. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify what's meant by \"exactly two of these things.\" Are they considering the four items, including the candy hearts? So, when someone owns exactly two, that could be any two of the four, including the candy hearts. Similarly, exactly three would include the candy hearts as one of the three.\n\nBut wait, since everyone owns the candy hearts, that might complicate things. Let me think again.\n\nLet me denote the four items as D (diamond ring), G (golf clubs), S (spade), and C (candy hearts). Since every resident owns C, that means every resident is in set C. So when considering ownership of other items, we can think of C as the universal set.\n\nSo the problem reduces to three sets: D, G, S within the universal set C. So, we can model this as three sets within a universal set of 900.\n\nNow, the total number of residents is 900, so |C| = 900.\n\nGiven:\n- |D| = 195\n- |G| = 367\n- |S| = 562\n\nAlso given:\n- The number of people who own exactly two of the four items (including C) is 437.\n- The number of people who own exactly three of the four items is 234.\n\nBut wait, since C is included in all, owning exactly two of the four would mean owning two of D, G, S, and C. But since C is always owned, owning exactly two would mean owning C plus exactly one more. Wait, no. Wait, if you own exactly two of the four, that includes C or not? Hmm, no, because C is already owned by everyone. So, if someone owns exactly two, it would be C plus one more, because they can't not have C. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. If the four items are D, G, S, and C, and everyone owns C, then when we talk about someone owning exactly two of these four, it's C plus one of the others. Because if they own exactly two, and C is always one, then the other one has to be either D, G, or S. So, the count of exactly two would be the number of people owning C and exactly one of D, G, or S. Similarly, exactly three would be C plus two of the others, and exactly four would be all four, which is just C, D, G, S.\n\nWait, but the problem states that 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. So, I need to find how many own all four, which would be the intersection of D, G, S, and C. But since C is everyone, it's just the intersection of D, G, and S.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the 234 who own exactly three are those who own three of the four items. Since C is always included, that would mean 234 people own C and exactly two of D, G, S. So, these are the people who have three items: C plus two others. Similarly, the 437 who own exactly two would have C plus one other.\n\nSo, the total number of people is 900, which is equal to:\n\nNumber of people owning exactly one item + exactly two + exactly three + exactly four.\n\nBut wait, in this case, can someone own exactly one item? Because C is always owned, so the only way someone owns exactly one is if they own only C. But is that possible? The problem says each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts, but they could own only that. So, yes, there could be people who own only C.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again. It says each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that means every resident owns C, but they can own other things as well.\n\nSo, the total number of residents is the sum of:\n- Exactly one item: only C\n- Exactly two items: C and one other\n- Exactly three items: C and two others\n- Exactly four items: C, D, G, S\n\nSo, let's denote:\n- a = number of people who own exactly one item (only C)\n- b = number of people who own exactly two items (C and one other)\n- c = number of people who own exactly three items (C and two others)\n- d = number of people who own all four items (C, D, G, S)\n\nGiven that, we have:\na + b + c + d = 900\n\nWe are told that b = 437 and c = 234. So, substituting:\na + 437 + 234 + d = 900\nSo, a + d = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, a + d = 229.\n\nBut we need to find d, the number of people who own all four items.\n\nNow, let's think about the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets D, G, S. The total number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S is |D \u222a G \u222a S|.\n\nBut since everyone owns C, the total number of people is 900, but not everyone owns D, G, or S. So, the number of people who own at least one of D, G, S is 900 minus the number of people who own only C, which is a.\n\nSo, |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - a.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nBut |D \u222a G \u222a S| is 900 - a.\n\nSo, 900 - a = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nWe know |D|, |G|, |S| as 195, 367, 562.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n900 - a = 195 + 367 + 562 - (|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nCalculating 195 + 367 + 562: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSo, 900 - a = 1124 - (|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nBut |D \u2229 G|, |D \u2229 S|, |G \u2229 S| are the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S, plus those owning all three.\n\nWait, because |D \u2229 G| includes those who own D and G and possibly others, like S or C. But in our case, since C is universal, the intersections would include those who own D and G and C, but not necessarily S. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, but we have data about the number of people owning exactly two of the four items, which includes C. So, when someone owns exactly two of the four, that could be C and D, C and G, C and S, or exactly two of D, G, S without C. Wait, but that's not possible because everyone owns C. So, if someone owns exactly two items, it must be C and one other. Similarly, exactly three items must be C and two others, and exactly four items must be all four.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the number of people owning exactly two of the four is equal to the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S, plus C. Wait, no. Because when someone owns exactly two of the four, it's C and one other. So, the count for exactly two is the sum of people owning C and D only, C and G only, C and S only.\n\nSimilarly, the count for exactly three is the number of people owning C, D, G; C, D, S; and C, G, S.\n\nAnd the count for exactly four is those owning all four, which is C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, in terms of the inclusion-exclusion formula, the total |D \u222a G \u222a S| is 900 - a, as before.\n\nBut let's think about the intersections:\n\nThe number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S is the sum of the pairwise intersections minus three times those owning all three (since each trio is counted three times in the pairwise counts). Wait, perhaps not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S is equal to:\n\n(|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) - 3 * |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nWait, no. Because |D \u2229 G| includes those who own D, G, and possibly S or C. But in our case, since everyone owns C, |D \u2229 G| includes those who own D, G, and C, and possibly S. But we need the number of people who own exactly two of D, G, S, which would be C plus one of D, G, S. So, perhaps |D \u2229 G| minus |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| gives the number of people who own D and G but not S, but since everyone owns C, this would be the number of people who own exactly two items: C, D, G.\n\nSimilarly, |D \u2229 S| - |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| is the number of people owning exactly two items: C, D, S.\n\nAnd |G \u2229 S| - |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| is the number of people owning exactly two items: C, G, S.\n\nSo, the total number of people owning exactly two of the four items (which is exactly two of D, G, S plus C) is:\n\n(|D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|) + (|D \u2229 S| - |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|) + (|G \u2229 S| - |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|)\n\nWhich simplifies to (|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) - 3 * |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|.\n\nBut according to the problem, the number of people owning exactly two of the four items is 437. So,\n\n(|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) - 3 * |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three of the four items is 234. Since exactly three would be C and two of D, G, S. So, the number of people owning exactly three is equal to |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|, because that's the intersection of all three, and since everyone owns C, this represents those owning all four items. Wait, no, because |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| is the number of people owning D, G, S, and since everyone owns C, these people own all four. But wait, the problem states that 234 own exactly three, which would be C plus two of D, G, S. But |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| is the number of people owning all three, which would be the same as owning all four because C is always included. Wait, that can't be right because |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| would include C as well.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me clarify.\n\nThe number of people owning exactly three of the four items (including C) is the sum of the number of people owning C, D, G; C, D, S; and C, G, S. Each of these is the intersection of two of D, G, S, minus the intersection of all three.\n\nWait, no. The number of people owning exactly three items is the number of people in exactly two of the D, G, S sets plus C. So, it's the sum over each pair of D, G, S of the number of people in their intersection minus the intersection of all three.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to denote:\n\nLet me define the following variables:\n\n- x = number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S (but since everyone owns C, this would mean they own only C and one other)\n- y = number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S (so they own C and two others)\n- z = number of people owning all three of D, G, S (so they own all four items, including C)\n\nBut wait, according to the problem, the number of people owning exactly two of the four items is 437. Since the four items include C, then owning exactly two would mean owning C plus one of D, G, S. So, that's x, the number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S along with C. Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three of the four items is z, which is the number of people owning all three of D, G, S along with C.\n\nWait, that might not align correctly. Let me think again.\n\nActually, if someone owns exactly two of the four items, it's C plus one other. So, the count is the number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S. Because they have C plus one more. So, if x is the number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S, then x = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three of the four items is the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S. Because they have C plus two others. So, if y is the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S, then y = 234.\n\nAnd the number of people owning all four is the number of people owning all three of D, G, S, which is z. So, z is the number we're looking for.\n\nBut wait, that's conflicting with earlier definitions. Let me try to structure this properly.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- a: number of people owning only C (exactly one item)\n- b: number of people owning C and exactly one of D, G, S (exactly two items)\n- c: number of people owning C and exactly two of D, G, S (exactly three items)\n- d: number of people owning C and all three of D, G, S (exactly four items)\n\nSo, according to the problem, the number of people owning exactly two items is 437, which is b. The number of people owning exactly three items is 234, which is c. And the number of people owning all four items is d, which is what we're trying to find.\n\nSo, the total number of people is:\n\na + b + c + d = 900\n\nWe know b = 437, c = 234. So,\n\na + 437 + 234 + d = 900\n\na + d = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, equation 1: a + d = 229.\n\nNow, let's consider the counts for each of D, G, S.\n\nThe number of people owning D is |D| = 195. This includes:\n\n- Those who own only D and C: let's call this number b_d\n- Those who own D and another one: b_d is part of b\n- Those who own D and two others: part of c\n- Those who own all three: part of d\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express |D| as the sum of:\n\n- People who own only D and C (part of b)\n- People who own D and G and C (part of c)\n- People who own D and S and C (part of c)\n- People who own D, G, S, and C (part of d)\n\nSimilarly for |G| and |S|.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to use the inclusion-exclusion formula.\n\nThe total number of people owning D, G, or S is |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - a.\n\nFrom the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nWe know |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - a.\n\nSo,\n\n900 - a = 195 + 367 + 562 - (|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nCalculating 195 + 367 + 562: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSo,\n\n900 - a = 1124 - (|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nRearranging,\n\n(|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) - |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| = 1124 - (900 - a) = 1124 - 900 + a = 224 + a.\n\nNow, let's think about what |D \u2229 G|, |D \u2229 S|, and |G \u2229 S| represent.\n\nEach of these intersections includes:\n\n- People who own exactly two of D, G, S and C (which is part of b)\n- People who own exactly three of D, G, S and C (which is part of c)\n- People who own all four (which is part of d)\n\nWait, no. Actually, |D \u2229 G| is the number of people who own both D and G, regardless of whether they own S or C. But since everyone owns C, |D \u2229 G| includes all people who own D, G, and C. But they might also own S. So, the exact count is:\n\n|D \u2229 G| = (number of people owning C, D, G) + (number of people owning C, D, G, S).\n\nSimilarly, |D \u2229 G| = c_dg + d, where c_dg is the number of people owning exactly three items (C, D, G), and d is the number owning all four.\n\nBut wait, in our earlier definitions, c is the number of people owning exactly three items, which would include all combinations of two from D, G, S. So, the total c is the sum of c_dg, c_d_s, c_g_s, each being the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S plus C.\n\nWait, but earlier I defined c as the number of people owning exactly three items, which is 234. So, c = c_dg + c_d_s + c_g_s.\n\nSimilarly, the intersections:\n\n|D \u2229 G| = c_dg + d\n|D \u2229 S| = c_d_s + d\n|G \u2229 S| = c_g_s + d\n\nSo, summing them up:\n\n|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S| = (c_dg + d) + (c_d_s + d) + (c_g_s + d) = (c_dg + c_d_s + c_g_s) + 3d = c + 3d.\n\nBecause c_dg + c_d_s + c_g_s = c.\n\nSo, substituting back into our earlier equation:\n\n(|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) - |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| = (c + 3d) - |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nBut |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| is the number of people owning all three, which is d. Because d is the number of people owning all four, which includes D, G, S, and C. So, |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| = d.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n(c + 3d) - d = c + 2d.\n\nWe had earlier that this equals 224 + a.\n\nSo,\n\nc + 2d = 224 + a.\n\nBut from equation 1, we have a + d = 229.\n\nSo, we can express a as 229 - d.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nc + 2d = 224 + (229 - d)\nc + 2d = 224 + 229 - d\nc + 2d = 453 - d\n\nNow, moving d to the left:\n\nc + 3d = 453.\n\nBut we know c = 234.\n\nSo,\n\n234 + 3d = 453\n\nSubtract 234:\n\n3d = 453 - 234 = 219.\n\nSo,\n\nd = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nSo, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the overlaps between the sets of residents owning each item.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to parse it step by step. Hmm, there are 900 residents total. Each person owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's one thing everyone has. Then there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 respectively. \n\nWait, and then there's information about how many own exactly two things and exactly three things. Specifically, 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four items, which includes the candy hearts and the other three. \n\nSo, this seems like a problem involving sets and their overlaps. I remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall that. The formula for the union of four sets... Hmm, but since we have some information about exact overlaps, maybe I can approach it differently.\n\nWait, the formula for the union of n sets is the sum of the sizes minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the sum of all triple-wise intersections, and so on, alternating signs. But since we know exactly how many are in exactly two, exactly three, and all four, maybe I can model this with a Venn diagram approach.\n\nLet me denote:\n- A = set of people who own a diamond ring.\n- B = set of people who own a set of golf clubs.\n- C = set of people who own a garden spade.\n- D = set of people who own a bag of candy hearts. But wait, D is everyone because everyone has a candy heart. So D is the universal set here, right? So every resident is in D.\n\nBut since everyone is in D, the problem is about the overlaps of A, B, C within D. So, perhaps it's better to model this as three sets (A, B, C) within the universal set D.\n\nBut the problem is about four items, but since D is universal, maybe we can treat it as three sets and use the inclusion-exclusion principle accordingly.\n\nWait, but the question is about all four. So, the number of people who own all four is the same as the number who own A, B, C, and D, but since D is everyone, that's just the number of people who own all three of A, B, C. Oh, wait, but the problem says 234 own exactly three of these things. So, that would include owning A, B, C, and D, which is everyone. Wait, no, because D is always there, so when someone owns exactly three, that would mean they own A, B, C, but since D is included, that would actually make it four. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify what's meant by \"exactly two of these things.\" Are they considering the four items, including the candy hearts? So, when someone owns exactly two, that could be any two of the four, including the candy hearts. Similarly, exactly three would include the candy hearts as one of the three.\n\nBut wait, since everyone owns the candy hearts, that might complicate things. Let me think again.\n\nLet me denote the four items as D (diamond ring), G (golf clubs), S (spade), and C (candy hearts). Since every resident owns C, that means every resident is in set C. So when considering ownership of other items, we can think of C as the universal set.\n\nSo the problem reduces to three sets: D, G, S within the universal set C. So, we can model this as three sets within a universal set of 900.\n\nNow, the total number of residents is 900, so |C| = 900.\n\nGiven:\n- |D| = 195\n- |G| = 367\n- |S| = 562\n\nAlso given:\n- The number of people who own exactly two of the four items (including C) is 437.\n- The number of people who own exactly three of the four items is 234.\n\nBut wait, since C is included in all, owning exactly two of the four would mean owning two of D, G, S, and C. But since C is always owned, owning exactly two would mean owning C plus exactly one more. Wait, no. Wait, if you own exactly two of the four, that includes C or not? Hmm, no, because C is already owned by everyone. So, if someone owns exactly two, it would be C plus one more, because they can't not have C. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. If the four items are D, G, S, and C, and everyone owns C, then when we talk about someone owning exactly two of these four, it's C plus one of the others. Because if they own exactly two, and C is always one, then the other one has to be either D, G, or S. So, the count of exactly two would be the number of people owning C and exactly one of D, G, or S. Similarly, exactly three would be C plus two of the others, and exactly four would be all four, which is just C, D, G, S.\n\nWait, but the problem states that 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. So, I need to find how many own all four, which would be the intersection of D, G, S, and C. But since C is everyone, it's just the intersection of D, G, and S.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the 234 who own exactly three are those who own three of the four items. Since C is always included, that would mean 234 people own C and exactly two of D, G, S. So, these are the people who have three items: C plus two others. Similarly, the 437 who own exactly two would have C plus one other.\n\nSo, the total number of people is 900, which is equal to:\n\nNumber of people owning exactly one item + exactly two + exactly three + exactly four.\n\nBut wait, in this case, can someone own exactly one item? Because C is always owned, so the only way someone owns exactly one is if they own only C. But is that possible? The problem says each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts, but they could own only that. So, yes, there could be people who own only C.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again. It says each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that means every resident owns C, but they can own other things as well.\n\nSo, the total number of residents is the sum of:\n- Exactly one item: only C\n- Exactly two items: C and one other\n- Exactly three items: C and two others\n- Exactly four items: C, D, G, S\n\nSo, let's denote:\n- a = number of people who own exactly one item (only C)\n- b = number of people who own exactly two items (C and one other)\n- c = number of people who own exactly three items (C and two others)\n- d = number of people who own all four items (C, D, G, S)\n\nGiven that, we have:\na + b + c + d = 900\n\nWe are told that b = 437 and c = 234. So, substituting:\na + 437 + 234 + d = 900\nSo, a + d = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, a + d = 229.\n\nBut we need to find d, the number of people who own all four items.\n\nNow, let's think about the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets D, G, S. The total number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S is |D \u222a G \u222a S|.\n\nBut since everyone owns C, the total number of people is 900, but not everyone owns D, G, or S. So, the number of people who own at least one of D, G, S is 900 minus the number of people who own only C, which is a.\n\nSo, |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - a.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nBut |D \u222a G \u222a S| is 900 - a.\n\nSo, 900 - a = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nWe know |D|, |G|, |S| as 195, 367, 562.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n900 - a = 195 + 367 + 562 - (|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nCalculating 195 + 367 + 562: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSo, 900 - a = 1124 - (|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nBut |D \u2229 G|, |D \u2229 S|, |G \u2229 S| are the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S, plus those owning all three.\n\nWait, because |D \u2229 G| includes those who own D and G and possibly others, like S or C. But in our case, since C is universal, the intersections would include those who own D and G and C, but not necessarily S. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, but we have data about the number of people owning exactly two of the four items, which includes C. So, when someone owns exactly two of the four, that could be C and D, C and G, C and S, or exactly two of D, G, S without C. Wait, but that's not possible because everyone owns C. So, if someone owns exactly two items, it must be C and one other. Similarly, exactly three items must be C and two others, and exactly four items must be all four.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the number of people owning exactly two of the four is equal to the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S, plus C. Wait, no. Because when someone owns exactly two of the four, it's C and one other. So, the count for exactly two is the sum of people owning C and D only, C and G only, C and S only.\n\nSimilarly, the count for exactly three is the number of people owning C, D, G; C, D, S; and C, G, S.\n\nAnd the count for exactly four is those owning all four, which is C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, in terms of the inclusion-exclusion formula, the total |D \u222a G \u222a S| is 900 - a, as before.\n\nBut let's think about the intersections:\n\nThe number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S is the sum of the pairwise intersections minus three times those owning all three (since each trio is counted three times in the pairwise counts). Wait, perhaps not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S is equal to:\n\n(|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) - 3 * |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nWait, no. Because |D \u2229 G| includes those who own D, G, and possibly S or C. But in our case, since everyone owns C, |D \u2229 G| includes those who own D, G, and C, and possibly S. But we need the number of people who own exactly two of D, G, S, which would be C plus one of D, G, S. So, perhaps |D \u2229 G| minus |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| gives the number of people who own D and G but not S, but since everyone owns C, this would be the number of people who own exactly two items: C, D, G.\n\nSimilarly, |D \u2229 S| - |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| is the number of people owning exactly two items: C, D, S.\n\nAnd |G \u2229 S| - |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| is the number of people owning exactly two items: C, G, S.\n\nSo, the total number of people owning exactly two of the four items (which is exactly two of D, G, S plus C) is:\n\n(|D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|) + (|D \u2229 S| - |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|) + (|G \u2229 S| - |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|)\n\nWhich simplifies to (|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) - 3 * |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|.\n\nBut according to the problem, the number of people owning exactly two of the four items is 437. So,\n\n(|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) - 3 * |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three of the four items is 234. Since exactly three would be C and two of D, G, S. So, the number of people owning exactly three is equal to |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|, because that's the intersection of all three, and since everyone owns C, this represents those owning all four items. Wait, no, because |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| is the number of people owning D, G, S, and since everyone owns C, these people own all four. But wait, the problem states that 234 own exactly three, which would be C plus two of D, G, S. But |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| is the number of people owning all three, which would be the same as owning all four because C is always included. Wait, that can't be right because |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| would include C as well.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me clarify.\n\nThe number of people owning exactly three of the four items (including C) is the sum of the number of people owning C, D, G; C, D, S; and C, G, S. Each of these is the intersection of two of D, G, S, minus the intersection of all three.\n\nWait, no. The number of people owning exactly three items is the number of people in exactly two of the D, G, S sets plus C. So, it's the sum over each pair of D, G, S of the number of people in their intersection minus the intersection of all three.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to denote:\n\nLet me define the following variables:\n\n- x = number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S (but since everyone owns C, this would mean they own only C and one other)\n- y = number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S (so they own C and two others)\n- z = number of people owning all three of D, G, S (so they own all four items, including C)\n\nBut wait, according to the problem, the number of people owning exactly two of the four items is 437. Since the four items include C, then owning exactly two would mean owning C plus one of D, G, S. So, that's x, the number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S along with C. Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three of the four items is z, which is the number of people owning all three of D, G, S along with C.\n\nWait, that might not align correctly. Let me think again.\n\nActually, if someone owns exactly two of the four items, it's C plus one other. So, the count is the number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S. Because they have C plus one more. So, if x is the number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S, then x = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three of the four items is the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S. Because they have C plus two others. So, if y is the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S, then y = 234.\n\nAnd the number of people owning all four is the number of people owning all three of D, G, S, which is z. So, z is the number we're looking for.\n\nBut wait, that's conflicting with earlier definitions. Let me try to structure this properly.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- a: number of people owning only C (exactly one item)\n- b: number of people owning C and exactly one of D, G, S (exactly two items)\n- c: number of people owning C and exactly two of D, G, S (exactly three items)\n- d: number of people owning C and all three of D, G, S (exactly four items)\n\nSo, according to the problem, the number of people owning exactly two items is 437, which is b. The number of people owning exactly three items is 234, which is c. And the number of people owning all four items is d, which is what we're trying to find.\n\nSo, the total number of people is:\n\na + b + c + d = 900\n\nWe know b = 437, c = 234. So,\n\na + 437 + 234 + d = 900\n\na + d = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, equation 1: a + d = 229.\n\nNow, let's consider the counts for each of D, G, S.\n\nThe number of people owning D is |D| = 195. This includes:\n\n- Those who own only D and C: let's call this number b_d\n- Those who own D and another one: b_d is part of b\n- Those who own D and two others: part of c\n- Those who own all three: part of d\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express |D| as the sum of:\n\n- People who own only D and C (part of b)\n- People who own D and G and C (part of c)\n- People who own D and S and C (part of c)\n- People who own D, G, S, and C (part of d)\n\nSimilarly for |G| and |S|.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to use the inclusion-exclusion formula.\n\nThe total number of people owning D, G, or S is |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - a.\n\nFrom the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nWe know |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - a.\n\nSo,\n\n900 - a = 195 + 367 + 562 - (|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nCalculating 195 + 367 + 562: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSo,\n\n900 - a = 1124 - (|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nRearranging,\n\n(|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) - |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| = 1124 - (900 - a) = 1124 - 900 + a = 224 + a.\n\nNow, let's think about what |D \u2229 G|, |D \u2229 S|, and |G \u2229 S| represent.\n\nEach of these intersections includes:\n\n- People who own exactly two of D, G, S and C (which is part of b)\n- People who own exactly three of D, G, S and C (which is part of c)\n- People who own all four (which is part of d)\n\nWait, no. Actually, |D \u2229 G| is the number of people who own both D and G, regardless of whether they own S or C. But since everyone owns C, |D \u2229 G| includes all people who own D, G, and C. But they might also own S. So, the exact count is:\n\n|D \u2229 G| = (number of people owning C, D, G) + (number of people owning C, D, G, S).\n\nSimilarly, |D \u2229 G| = c_dg + d, where c_dg is the number of people owning exactly three items (C, D, G), and d is the number owning all four.\n\nBut wait, in our earlier definitions, c is the number of people owning exactly three items, which would include all combinations of two from D, G, S. So, the total c is the sum of c_dg, c_d_s, c_g_s, each being the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S plus C.\n\nWait, but earlier I defined c as the number of people owning exactly three items, which is 234. So, c = c_dg + c_d_s + c_g_s.\n\nSimilarly, the intersections:\n\n|D \u2229 G| = c_dg + d\n|D \u2229 S| = c_d_s + d\n|G \u2229 S| = c_g_s + d\n\nSo, summing them up:\n\n|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S| = (c_dg + d) + (c_d_s + d) + (c_g_s + d) = (c_dg + c_d_s + c_g_s) + 3d = c + 3d.\n\nBecause c_dg + c_d_s + c_g_s = c.\n\nSo, substituting back into our earlier equation:\n\n(|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) - |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| = (c + 3d) - |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nBut |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| is the number of people owning all three, which is d. Because d is the number of people owning all four, which includes D, G, S, and C. So, |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| = d.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n(c + 3d) - d = c + 2d.\n\nWe had earlier that this equals 224 + a.\n\nSo,\n\nc + 2d = 224 + a.\n\nBut from equation 1, we have a + d = 229.\n\nSo, we can express a as 229 - d.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nc + 2d = 224 + (229 - d)\nc + 2d = 224 + 229 - d\nc + 2d = 453 - d\n\nNow, moving d to the left:\n\nc + 3d = 453.\n\nBut we know c = 234.\n\nSo,\n\n234 + 3d = 453\n\nSubtract 234:\n\n3d = 453 - 234 = 219.\n\nSo,\n\nd = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nSo, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the overlaps between the sets of residents owning each item. Let's denote:\n\n- \\( |D| = 195 \\) (diamond ring owners),\n- \\( |G| = 367 \\) (golf clubs owners),\n- \\( |S| = 562 \\) (garden spade owners),\n- \\( |C| = 900 \\) (candy hearts, universal set),\n- \\( b = 437 \\) (residents owning exactly two items, including candy hearts),\n- \\( c = 234 \\) (residents owning exactly three items, including candy hearts),\n- \\( d \\) (residents owning all four items, which we need to find).\n\nThe total number of residents is given by:\n\\[\na + b + c + d = 900\n\\]\nwhere \\( a \\) is the number of residents owning only candy hearts. Substituting the known values:\n\\[\na + 437 + 234 + d = 900 \\implies a + d = 229.\n\\]\n\nNext, we apply the inclusion-exclusion principle to the sets \\( D, G, S \\):\n\\[\n|D \\cup G \\cup S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \\cap G| - |D \\cap S| - |G \\cap S| + |D \\cap G \\cap S|.\n\\]\nSince \\( |D \\cup G \\cup S| = 900 - a \\), we substitute:\n\\[\n900 - a = 195 + 367 + 562 - (|D \\cap G| + |D \\cap S| + |G \\cap S|) + |D \\cap G \\cap S|.\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n900 - a = 1124 - (|D \\cap G| + |D \\cap S| + |G \\cap S|) + |D \\cap G \\cap S|.\n\\]\nRearranging:\n\\[\n(|D \\cap G| + |D \\cap S| + |G \\cap S|) - |D \\cap G \\cap S| = 1124 - (900 - a) = 224 + a.\n\\]\n\nEach intersection \\( |D \\cap G|, |D \\cap S|, |G \\cap S| \\) includes residents owning exactly two items (\\( b \\)) and those owning all three (\\( d \\)). Thus:\n\\[\n|D \\cap G| + |D \\cap S| + |G \\cap S| = c + 3d,\n\\]\nwhere \\( c = 234 \\) is the number of residents owning exactly three items. Substituting:\n\\[\nc + 3d - d = 224 + a \\implies c + 2d = 224 + a.\n\\]\nUsing \\( a = 229 - d \\):\n\\[\n234 + 2d = 224 + (229 - d) \\implies 234 + 2d = 453 - d.\n\\]\nSolving for \\( d \\):\n\\[\n3d = 219 \\implies d = 73.\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four items is \\(\\boxed{73}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complex, but I'll take it slow.\n\nAlright, the problem says there are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's one thing everyone has. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 respectively. \n\nWait, so the residents can own any combination of these four items. Some own just one, some own two, some three, and maybe some own all four. The problem also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. But the question is asking for the number of residents who own all four. \n\nHmm, I think this is a problem about sets and their intersections. Maybe I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the three-set intersections, and so on. \n\nBut wait, in this problem, we have four sets: candy hearts, diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. But since every resident owns a candy heart, that might complicate things. Let me think. Oh, wait, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's a given for everyone. So, the four items are: candy hearts (which everyone has), diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades.\n\nBut the way the problem is phrased, it's about ownership of the other three items, plus the candy hearts. So, when it says 195 own a diamond ring, that includes those who might also own other things, right? Because candy hearts are already included in everyone.\n\nSo, perhaps I should model this using four sets: C (candy hearts), D (diamond rings), G (golf clubs), and S (spades). But since C is universal (every resident owns it), we can maybe simplify the problem by considering the other three sets D, G, S in relation to C.\n\nWait, but the problem is about owning all four, so maybe I can model it without considering C as a separate set because it's already included in everyone. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, since every resident owns a candy heart, the total number of residents is the same as the union of all four sets. But in this case, the four sets would be the four items, but since everyone owns the candy hearts, the union is just 900. \n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the four items being C, D, G, S, with C being the set of all 900. Then, D, G, S are subsets of C. So, we can model the ownership of D, G, S within C.\n\nBut the problem gives me the number of people owning exactly two of the things and exactly three. But since everyone has C, when they say exactly two, does that include C or not? Hmm, this is a crucial point. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem states: \"there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\" It says \"these things,\" which refers to the four items mentioned: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, the exact counts include all four items.\n\nWait, so when it says exactly two, it could be any two of the four, including the candy hearts. Similarly, exactly three includes any three, including the candy hearts. But wait, but if someone owns exactly three things, and one of them is the candy heart, which everyone has, that's possible. \n\nBut wait, since everyone owns the candy hearts, is it possible to own exactly two things without including the candy hearts? No, because if you don't count the candy hearts, then you would be owning zero of the other things, but that's not the case. Wait, no, because the other things are D, G, S. So, owning exactly two things could mean, for example, owning D and G but not S or C. Wait, but since C is already owned by everyone, if you own D and G, you must have C as well. So, in reality, when the problem says \"exactly two of these things,\" it's referring to exactly two of the four items, which includes C. So, someone who owns exactly two things would have, for example, C and D, but not G or S. Similarly, someone who owns exactly three things would have C, D, and G, but not S, and so on.\n\nBut that complicates the matter because the candy hearts are already included in everyone. So, perhaps I should model it as the other three items. Let me clarify: Let me consider the four items as four sets. However, since all 900 residents are in the set C (candy hearts), we can model the problem using the other three sets D, G, S. \n\nWait, but the problem is about all four items. So, perhaps it's better to think of the problem as having four sets, where the universal set is C, which has 900 elements. The other sets D, G, S are subsets of C. The problem then gives us the counts for D, G, S, and the counts for exactly two and exactly three of all four items.\n\nWait, maybe I can approach this by considering the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets, but it's a bit complicated. Alternatively, since the candy hearts are already included in everyone, perhaps I can model the problem in terms of D, G, S, and the overlaps.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- Total residents, T = 900.\n\n- Number of people owning D = 195.\n\n- Number owning G = 367.\n\n- Number owning S = 562.\n\n- Number owning exactly two of the four items = 437.\n\n- Number owning exactly three of the four items = 234.\n\nWe need to find the number owning all four, which is the intersection of D, G, S, and C. But since C is everyone, that's just the intersection of D, G, S.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the inclusion-exclusion for the three sets D, G, S, with the universal set C.\n\nWait, but the problem gives the counts for exactly two and exactly three of all four items. Hmm, maybe I should model it differently.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the four items as four sets: C, D, G, S. Since C is the universal set, the problem is about the overlaps among D, G, S within C.\n\nBut the problem states that 437 own exactly two of the four things, and 234 own exactly three. So, these counts include C as one of the four. So, for example, someone who owns exactly two things could be C and D, or C and G, etc.\n\nWait, but that complicates the analysis because the number of exactly two includes combinations that include C. So, perhaps it's better to model it as four sets and use inclusion-exclusion for the four sets.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to structure this using the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. The formula for the union of four sets is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |C\u2229D| - |C\u2229G| - |C\u2229S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |C\u2229D\u2229G| + |C\u2229D\u2229S| + |C\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| - |C\u2229D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nBut wait, since C is the universal set, the union of D, G, S, and C is just C, which has 900 elements. So, |D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = |C| = 900.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful yet. Let me write down the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |C\u2229D| - |C\u2229G| - |C\u2229S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |C\u2229D\u2229G| + |C\u2229D\u2229S| + |C\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| - |C\u2229D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nBut since |D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = |C| = 900, we can write:\n\n900 = 900 + |D| + |G| + |S| - |C\u2229D| - |C\u2229G| - |C\u2229S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |C\u2229D\u2229G| + |C\u2229D\u2229S| + |C\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| - |C\u2229D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nWait, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can rearrange this equation.\n\nSubtracting 900 from both sides:\n\n0 = |D| + |G| + |S| - |C\u2229D| - |C\u2229G| - |C\u2229S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |C\u2229D\u2229G| + |C\u2229D\u2229S| + |C\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| - |C\u2229D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps I can find another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this problem using the counts of exactly two and exactly three, and then use the inclusion-exclusion principle in a different way.\n\nLet me recall that for three sets, the inclusion-exclusion formula is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nBut in our case, since we have four sets, but C is universal, maybe we can focus on the other three.\n\nWait, but the problem gives the counts of people owning exactly two and exactly three of all four items. So, perhaps it's better to consider all four items, but since C is universal, the counts for exactly two and exactly three are a bit different.\n\nLet me think about the number of people owning exactly two of the four items. Since everyone owns C, the possible pairs are:\n\n- C and D\n\n- C and G\n\n- C and S\n\n- D and G\n\n- D and S\n\n- G and S\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three would be:\n\n- C, D, G\n\n- C, D, S\n\n- C, G, S\n\n- D, G, S\n\nAnd the number owning all four is C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, perhaps I can denote the following variables:\n\nLet a = number owning exactly C and D (and nothing else).\n\nb = exactly C and G.\n\nc = exactly C and S.\n\nd = exactly D and G (and nothing else).\n\ne = exactly D and S.\n\nf = exactly G and S.\n\ng = exactly C, D, G.\n\nh = exactly C, D, S.\n\ni = exactly C, G, S.\n\nj = exactly D, G, S.\n\nk = exactly C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, the total number of people owning exactly two is a + b + c + d + e + f = 437.\n\nThe total number of people owning exactly three is g + h + i + j = 234.\n\nAnd the number owning all four is k.\n\nNow, the total number of people is the sum of all these categories plus those who own only C, but the problem says everyone owns C, so the only way someone doesn't own any of D, G, S is if they own only C. But the problem doesn't mention how many own only C. Wait, but the total number of people is 900, so:\n\nNumber owning only C = 900 - (a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j + k).\n\nWait, but that might complicate things. Let me see if I can find another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the counts of D, G, S.\n\nThe number of people owning D is 195. This includes those who own only D, those who own D and another item, and those who own D and two others, and those who own all four.\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nSo, the count for D is:\n\nNumber owning only D (but since everyone owns C, this would be people owning only D and C, which is a). Wait, no, because if someone owns only D and C, that's exactly two items. So, the count for D includes:\n\na (C and D)\n\nd (D and G)\n\ne (D and S)\n\ng (C, D, G)\n\nh (C, D, S)\n\nj (D, G, S)\n\nk (all four)\n\nSimilarly, the count for D is a + d + e + g + h + j + k.\n\nWait, but that seems complicated. Let me try to write equations for each set.\n\nFor D:\n\n|D| = a + d + e + g + h + j + k = 195.\n\nFor G:\n\n|G| = b + d + f + g + i + j + k = 367.\n\nFor S:\n\n|S| = c + e + f + h + i + j + k = 562.\n\nHmm, that's a lot of variables. But perhaps I can find another way using the given data.\n\nWait, I also know that the number of people owning exactly two is 437, which is a + b + c + d + e + f = 437.\n\nThe number of people owning exactly three is 234, which is g + h + i + j = 234.\n\nAnd the number owning all four is k.\n\nNow, perhaps I can find the sum of |D| + |G| + |S|.\n\nThat would be 195 + 367 + 562 = let's calculate that.\n\n195 + 367 = 562, plus 562 is 1124.\n\nSo, |D| + |G| + |S| = 1124.\n\nNow, let's express |D| + |G| + |S| in terms of the variables.\n\nFrom the earlier breakdown:\n\n|D| = a + d + e + g + h + j + k.\n\nSimilarly for |G| and |S|.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n|D| + |G| + |S| = (a + d + e + g + h + j + k) + (b + d + f + g + i + j + k) + (c + e + f + h + i + j + k).\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n= a + d + e + g + h + j + k + b + d + f + g + i + j + k + c + e + f + h + i + j + k.\n\nNow, let's collect like terms:\n\na + b + c = sum of exactly two in C and one other.\n\nd appears twice (from D and G): 2d.\n\ne appears twice (from D and S): 2e.\n\nf appears twice (from G and S): 2f.\n\ng appears twice (from D and G): 2g.\n\nh appears twice (from D and S): 2h.\n\ni appears twice (from G and S): 2i.\n\nj appears three times (from D, G, S).\n\nk appears three times (from D, G, S).\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nLooking at each term:\n\n- a, b, c: each appears once.\n\n- d: appears in D and G, so twice.\n\n- e: appears in D and S, so twice.\n\n- f: appears in G and S, so twice.\n\n- g: appears in D and G, so twice.\n\n- h: appears in D and S, so twice.\n\n- i: appears in G and S, so twice.\n\n- j: appears in D, G, and S, so three times.\n\n- k: appears in D, G, and S, so three times.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n|D| + |G| + |S| = (a + b + c) + 2(d + e + f) + 2(g + h + i) + 3j + 3k.\n\nWe know that |D| + |G| + |S| = 1124.\n\nSo,\n\n(a + b + c) + 2(d + e + f) + 2(g + h + i) + 3j + 3k = 1124.\n\nNow, from the problem, we know that the number of people owning exactly two is 437, which is a + b + c + d + e + f = 437.\n\nLet me denote this as equation (1): a + b + c + d + e + f = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three is 234, which is g + h + i + j = 234. Let's call this equation (2): g + h + i + j = 234.\n\nAlso, the number of people owning all four is k, which is our target.\n\nSo, let's see if we can express the previous equation in terms of these variables.\n\nOur equation from |D| + |G| + |S| is:\n\n(a + b + c) + 2(d + e + f) + 2(g + h + i) + 3j + 3k = 1124.\n\nLet me rewrite this:\n\n(a + b + c) + 2(d + e + f) + 2(g + h + i) + 3(j + k) = 1124.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can substitute some of these sums using equations (1) and (2).\n\nFrom equation (1): a + b + c = 437 - (d + e + f).\n\nSimilarly, from equation (2): g + h + i = 234 - j.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n(437 - (d + e + f)) + 2(d + e + f) + 2(234 - j) + 3(j + k) = 1124.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, expand:\n\n437 - d - e - f + 2d + 2e + 2f + 2*234 - 2j + 3j + 3k = 1124.\n\nNow, let's compute the constants and combine like terms.\n\n437 + (2*234) = 437 + 468 = 905.\n\nThen, the terms involving d, e, f:\n\n(-d - e - f) + (2d + 2e + 2f) = ( (-1 + 2)d ) + ( (-1 + 2)e ) + ( (-1 + 2)f ) = d + e + f.\n\nThe terms involving j:\n\n-2j + 3j = j.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n905 + (d + e + f) + j + 3k = 1124.\n\nNow, let's rearrange:\n\nd + e + f + j + 3k = 1124 - 905 = 219.\n\nSo, equation (3): d + e + f + j + 3k = 219.\n\nHmm, but I don't know what d, e, f, j are individually. Let me see if I can find another equation involving these variables.\n\nWait, from equation (2): g + h + i + j = 234. So, j = 234 - (g + h + i).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps yet.\n\nWait, another approach: The total number of residents is 900. Let's express that in terms of the variables.\n\nTotal residents = number of people owning only C + exactly two items + exactly three items + all four items.\n\nBut wait, no, because the problem includes all four items. So, the only people not owning any of D, G, S are those who own only C. Let me denote that as m.\n\nSo,\n\nm + (a + b + c + d + e + f) + (g + h + i + j) + k = 900.\n\nWhich is:\n\nm + 437 + 234 + k = 900.\n\nSo,\n\nm + k = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, m + k = 229.\n\nBut I don't know m or k yet.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I can find another equation involving d, e, f, j, etc.\n\nWait, let's go back to equation (3): d + e + f + j + 3k = 219.\n\nIs there a way to express d + e + f + j in terms of other variables?\n\nWait, perhaps I can find another equation. Let me think about the sum of the pairwise intersections.\n\nThe sum of pairwise intersections for D, G, S is |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|.\n\nEach of these intersections includes people who own exactly two of D, G, S, plus those who own three or all four.\n\nFor example:\n\n|D\u2229G| = number of people owning both D and G, which includes those who own exactly D and G (d), plus those who own D, G, and C (g), plus those who own D, G, and S (j), plus those who own all four (k).\n\nWait, no, because if someone owns all four, they're included in every pairwise intersection.\n\nSo, |D\u2229G| = d + g + j + k.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n|D\u2229S| = e + h + j + k,\n\n|G\u2229S| = f + i + j + k.\n\nSo, the sum |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| = (d + g + j + k) + (e + h + j + k) + (f + i + j + k).\n\n= d + e + f + g + h + i + 3j + 3k.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets. Let me consider D, G, S as three sets within C.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nBut we don't know |D \u222a G \u222a S|, but perhaps we can express it in terms of the variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can relate this to the total number of people, which is 900.\n\nWait, the union of D, G, S is the number of people who own at least one of D, G, or S. Since everyone owns C, the number of people who own at least one of D, G, S is equal to the total number of people minus those who own only C. So,\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - m.\n\nAnd since m + k = 229, we can write |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - (229 - k) = 900 - 229 + k = 671 + k.\n\nSo,\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 671 + k.\n\nNow, using the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nWe know |D| = 195, |G|=367, |S|=562. So,\n\n671 + k = 195 + 367 + 562 - (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|) + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nLet me compute 195 + 367 + 562. That's 195 + 367 = 562, plus 562 is 1124. So,\n\n671 + k = 1124 - (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|) + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nRearranging,\n\n|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| = 1124 - (671 + k) + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nWait, but |D\u2229G\u2229S| is the number of people who own all three D, G, S, which is j + k. Because j is exactly three (D, G, S), and k is all four, which includes C as well. So, |D\u2229G\u2229S| = j + k.\n\nWait, no, because |D\u2229G\u2229S| is the number of people who own D, G, and S, regardless of C. But since everyone owns C, |D\u2229G\u2229S| is the same as the number of people who own all three D, G, S, which includes those who own exactly three (j) and those who own all four (k). So, |D\u2229G\u2229S| = j + k.\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| = 1124 - (671 + k) + (j + k).\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 1124 - 671 - k + j + k\n\n= 1124 - 671 + j\n\n= 453 + j.\n\nSo,\n\n|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| = 453 + j.\n\nBut earlier, we found that |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| = d + e + f + g + h + i + 3j + 3k.\n\nWait, no, earlier when we expanded |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|, we had:\n\n= (d + g + j + k) + (e + h + j + k) + (f + i + j + k)\n\n= d + e + f + g + h + i + 3j + 3k.\n\nSo,\n\nd + e + f + g + h + i + 3j + 3k = 453 + j.\n\nHmm, let's rearrange this equation:\n\nd + e + f + g + h + i + 3j + 3k - j = 453.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nd + e + f + g + h + i + 2j + 3k = 453.\n\nNow, from equation (2), g + h + i + j = 234. Let me denote this as:\n\ng + h + i = 234 - j.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nd + e + f + (234 - j) + 2j + 3k = 453.\n\nSimplify:\n\nd + e + f + 234 + j + 3k = 453.\n\nSo,\n\nd + e + f + j + 3k = 453 - 234 = 219.\n\nWait, that's the same as equation (3): d + e + f + j + 3k = 219.\n\nSo, that doesn't give us new information. Hmm, maybe I need another approach.\n\nWait, I have equation (3): d + e + f + j + 3k = 219.\n\nAnd I also have equation (2): g + h + i + j = 234.\n\nI think I need another equation to relate these variables. Let me think about the total number of people who own exactly two, exactly three, all four, and only C.\n\nFrom earlier, m + 437 + 234 + k = 900.\n\nSo, m + k = 229.\n\nBut I don't know m or k. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find another equation by considering the sum of the pairwise intersections.\n\nWait, I think I'm stuck here. Maybe I can try to express everything in terms of k.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFrom equation (3): d + e + f + j + 3k = 219.\n\nFrom equation (2): g + h + i + j = 234.\n\nSo, perhaps I can subtract equation (2) from equation (3) to find a relationship between d + e + f and g + h + i.\n\nWait, equation (3): d + e + f + j + 3k = 219.\n\nEquation (2): g + h + i + j = 234.\n\nSubtracting equation (2) from equation (3):\n\n(d + e + f) - (g + h + i) + 3k = 219 - 234.\n\nSo,\n\n(d + e + f) - (g + h + i) + 3k = -15.\n\nHmm, but I don't know if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express (d + e + f) as (g + h + i) - 15 - 3k.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I can express (d + e + f) in terms of equation (1).\n\nFrom equation (1): a + b + c + d + e + f = 437.\n\nSo, (d + e + f) = 437 - (a + b + c).\n\nHmm, but I don't know a, b, c.\n\nThis is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that the number of people owning exactly two is 437, which includes all pairs. So, the sum of all pairwise exactly-two counts is 437.\n\nBut each pairwise exactly-two count is:\n\na (C and D),\n\nb (C and G),\n\nc (C and S),\n\nd (D and G),\n\ne (D and S),\n\nf (G and S).\n\nSo, a + b + c + d + e + f = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three is 234, which includes:\n\ng (C, D, G),\n\nh (C, D, S),\n\ni (C, G, S),\n\nj (D, G, S).\n\nSo, g + h + i + j = 234.\n\nAnd the number of people owning all four is k.\n\nNow, perhaps I can think about the sum of all possible intersections.\n\nWait, the sum of all possible intersections for two sets is |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|.\n\nEach of these intersections includes:\n\n- Those who own exactly two of D, G, S: d, e, f.\n\n- Those who own three of them: g, h, i, j.\n\n- Those who own all four: k.\n\nSo,\n\n|D\u2229G| = d + g + j + k,\n\n|D\u2229S| = e + h + j + k,\n\n|G\u2229S| = f + i + j + k.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| = (d + e + f) + (g + h + i) + 3j + 3k.\n\nBut earlier, we found that this sum is equal to 453 + j.\n\nSo,\n\n(d + e + f) + (g + h + i) + 3j + 3k = 453 + j.\n\nRearranging,\n\n(d + e + f) + (g + h + i) + 2j + 3k = 453.\n\nHmm, and from equation (2), g + h + i = 234 - j.\n\nSubstituting,\n\n(d + e + f) + (234 - j) + 2j + 3k = 453.\n\nSimplify:\n\nd + e + f + 234 + j + 3k = 453.\n\nSo,\n\nd + e + f + j + 3k = 453 - 234 = 219.\n\nWhich brings us back to equation (3): d + e + f + j + 3k = 219.\n\nHmm, so I'm going in circles here. Maybe I need to find another equation involving these variables.\n\nWait, I also have the sum of |D| + |G| + |S| = 1124.\n\nEarlier, we expressed this as:\n\n(a + b + c) + 2(d + e + f) + 2(g + h + i) + 3j + 3k = 1124.\n\nBut from equation (1), a + b + c = 437 - (d + e + f).\n\nFrom equation (2), g + h + i = 234 - j.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n(437 - (d + e + f)) + 2(d + e + f) + 2(234 - j) + 3j + 3k = 1124.\n\nSimplify:\n\n437 - d - e - f + 2d + 2e + 2f + 468 - 2j + 3j + 3k = 1124.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n437 + 468 = 905.\n\n(-d - e - f) + (2d + 2e + 2f) = d + e + f.\n\n(-2j + 3j) = j.\n\nSo,\n\n905 + (d + e + f) + j + 3k = 1124.\n\nWhich gives:\n\nd + e + f + j + 3k = 219.\n\nWhich is equation (3) again.\n\nHmm, so no progress there.\n\nWait, maybe I can express (d + e + f) from equation (3):\n\nd + e + f = 219 - j - 3k.\n\nNow, from equation (1): a + b + c + d + e + f = 437.\n\nSubstituting (d + e + f):\n\na + b + c + (219 - j - 3k) = 437.\n\nSo,\n\na + b + c = 437 - (219 - j - 3k) = 437 - 219 + j + 3k = 218 + j + 3k.\n\nNow, let's consider the sum of |D| + |G| + |S| again, but perhaps I can find another way.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's think about the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S. As I thought earlier, this is |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - m.\n\nAnd from the inclusion-exclusion formula, this is also equal to |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nWhich we found earlier to be 1124 - (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|) + (j + k).\n\nBut we also found that |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| = 453 + j.\n\nSo,\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 1124 - (453 + j) + (j + k) = 1124 - 453 - j + j + k = 671 + k.\n\nWhich matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 671 + k.\n\nBut we also know that |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - m.\n\nAnd from earlier, m + k = 229, so m = 229 - k.\n\nThus,\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - (229 - k) = 671 + k.\n\nWhich matches what we had before.\n\nHmm, I'm not making progress. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that the number of people owning exactly two items is 437, which includes all the pairwise exactly-two counts. So, maybe I can find the sum of all exactly-two counts for D, G, S, excluding C.\n\nWait, but the exactly-two counts include C as well. So, for example, a is the count of people owning exactly C and D, which is a subset of D.\n\nSimilarly, d is the count of people owning exactly D and G, which doesn't include C. Wait, no, because C is already included in everyone, so if someone owns D and G, they must also own C, so d would be the count of people owning exactly D, G, and C. So, d is part of exactly three items.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nIf someone owns exactly two items, and C is one of them, then they own exactly two items: C and one other. So, a is C and D, b is C and G, c is C and S.\n\nIf someone owns exactly two items without C, that's impossible because C is already owned by everyone. So, the only way someone owns exactly two items is if they own C and one other item.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point! Because C is already included in everyone, you can't have someone owning exactly two items without including C. So, the exactly-two counts are all combinations that include C. Therefore, the 437 residents who own exactly two things are those who own C and exactly one other item. So, a + b + c = 437.\n\nWait, that changes everything! I think I made a mistake earlier by considering exactly-two counts that don't include C. But since C is already owned by everyone, you can't have exactly two items without including C. So, the exactly-two counts are only C paired with one other item. So, a + b + c = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the exactly-three counts would be people who own C and exactly two other items, plus those who own exactly three items without C. Wait, but again, since everyone owns C, the exactly-three counts would include C plus two others, and also those who own all three of D, G, S. Wait, no, because if someone owns all three of D, G, S, they must also own C, so that's four items. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\n- Exactly two items: since C is already included, exactly two items would mean C plus one other. So, exactly two items are C and D, C and G, or C and S. So, a + b + c = 437.\n\n- Exactly three items: since C is already included, exactly three would mean C plus two others. So, the possibilities are C, D, G; C, D, S; C, G, S. So, g + h + i = 234.\n\nWait, but the problem states that 234 own exactly three of the four items, which includes C. So, those 234 are the ones who own exactly three, which would be the sum of g + h + i. Because j (D, G, S) would be the ones who own all four, since they also have C.\n\nWait, no, if someone owns D, G, S, they must also own C, so j would actually be part of the all-four category, which is k. So, j = k. Because if someone owns D, G, S, they also own C, so they're in the all-four category.\n\nWait, that's a key point. So, j (D, G, S) would actually be the same as k (all four), because they have to have C as well. So, j = k.\n\nWait, but in our earlier definitions, j was exactly D, G, S, without C. But since everyone owns C, j must be zero. So, no one can own exactly D, G, S without C; they must own all four. So, j = 0.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the exactly-three counts are only those who own C plus two others. So, g + h + i = 234.\n\nAnd j = 0, because j was the count of people owning exactly D, G, S, which is impossible since they must own C as well. So, j = 0.\n\nThat simplifies things a lot.\n\nSo, let's redefine:\n\nExactly two items: a + b + c = 437.\n\nExactly three items: g + h + i = 234.\n\nExactly four items: k.\n\nAnd j = 0.\n\nNow, let's go back to the equation (3): d + e + f + j + 3k = 219.\n\nSince j = 0, this becomes:\n\nd + e + f + 3k = 219.\n\nBut what are d, e, f?\n\nWait, earlier, I defined:\n\nd = exactly D and G.\n\ne = exactly D and S.\n\nf = exactly G and S.\n\nBut if someone owns exactly D and G, they must also own C, because everyone owns C. So, d is the number of people who own exactly C, D, and G, which is part of the exactly-three counts. So, d = g.\n\nWait, no, because exactly three counts are those who own C plus two others. So, if someone owns exactly D and G, they must also own C, making it exactly three items, which is g (C, D, G). So, d = g.\n\nSimilarly, e = exactly D and S would be h (C, D, S).\n\nAnd f = exactly G and S would be i (C, G, S).\n\nWait, so d = g, e = h, f = i.\n\nSo, from the exactly-three counts: g + h + i = 234.\n\nWhich is the same as d + e + f = 234.\n\nWait, but earlier, equation (3) after substituting j=0 is:\n\nd + e + f + 3k = 219.\n\nBut d + e + f = 234.\n\nSo,\n\n234 + 3k = 219.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 234 + 3k = 219 implies 3k = -15, which is impossible since k can't be negative.\n\nHmm, that suggests I made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, let's go back. If d is the number of people owning exactly D and G, but since they must also own C, d is actually part of the exactly-three counts. So, d = g.\n\nSimilarly, e = h, and f = i.\n\nSo, d + e + f = g + h + i = 234.\n\nBut from equation (3): d + e + f + 3k = 219.\n\nSubstituting d + e + f = 234:\n\n234 + 3k = 219 \u2192 3k = -15 \u2192 k = -5.\n\nThat's impossible because the number of people can't be negative. So, I must have made a mistake in my definitions.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial assumption that j = 0 is incorrect. Because j was defined as exactly D, G, S, but since everyone owns C, j would actually be part of the all-four category, which is k. So, j = k.\n\nSo, in equation (2): g + h + i + j = 234 \u2192 g + h + i + k = 234.\n\nAnd equation (3): d + e + f + j + 3k = 219 \u2192 d + e + f + k + 3k = 219 \u2192 d + e + f + 4k = 219.\n\nBut earlier, I thought d = g, e = h, f = i, but that leads to a contradiction. So, perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps d, e, f are the counts of people who own exactly two of D, G, S, but not C. But that's impossible because everyone owns C. So, d, e, f must be zero. That would mean that all pairwise intersections include C.\n\nWait, but that can't be because then the pairwise intersections would be part of the exactly-three counts.\n\nI'm getting really confused here. Maybe I need to redefine the variables correctly.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nSince everyone owns C, the possible ownerships are:\n\n- Only C: m.\n\n- Exactly two items: C and one other (a, b, c).\n\n- Exactly three items: C and two others (g, h, i).\n\n- All four items: C, D, G, S (k).\n\nSo, in this case, there are no people who own exactly two items without C, and no one owns exactly three items without C. So, the exactly-two counts are a + b + c = 437.\n\nThe exactly-three counts are g + h + i = 234.\n\nAnd the all-four count is k.\n\nNow, the pairwise intersections:\n\n|D\u2229G| includes:\n\n- a (C and D and G? No, a is C and D, but not G. So, a is C and D only.\n\nWait, no, |D\u2229G| includes all people who own both D and G, regardless of other items. So, that includes:\n\n- Those who own exactly D, G, and C: g.\n\n- Those who own D, G, C, and possibly S: but if they own S, they would be in the all-four category, which is k.\n\nWait, so |D\u2229G| = g + k.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n|D\u2229S| = h + k,\n\n|G\u2229S| = i + k.\n\nSo, the sum of pairwise intersections is:\n\n|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| = (g + k) + (h + k) + (i + k) = g + h + i + 3k.\n\nBut from the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets, we have:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nWe know |D| = 195, |G|=367, |S|=562.\n\nSo,\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - (g + h + i + 3k) + (k).\n\nWait, because |D\u2229G\u2229S| is the number of people who own all three D, G, S, which would be k, since they also own C.\n\nSo,\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 1124 - (g + h + i + 3k) + k = 1124 - g - h - i - 2k.\n\nBut |D \u222a G \u222a S| is the number of people who own at least one of D, G, S, which is 900 - m.\n\nAnd from earlier, m + k = 229 \u2192 m = 229 - k.\n\nSo,\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - (229 - k) = 671 + k.\n\nPutting it together:\n\n671 + k = 1124 - (g + h + i) - 2k.\n\nBut from equation (2): g + h + i = 234.\n\nSo,\n\n671 + k = 1124 - 234 - 2k.\n\nSimplify:\n\n671 + k = 890 - 2k.\n\nAdding 2k to both sides:\n\n671 + 3k = 890.\n\nSubtracting 671:\n\n3k = 890 - 671 = 219.\n\nSo,\n\nk = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nSo, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the ownership of items among the 900 residents of Aimeville, where everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (C).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complex, but I'll take it slow.\n\nAlright, the problem says there are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's one thing everyone has. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 respectively. \n\nWait, so the residents can own any combination of these four items. Some own just one, some own two, some three, and maybe some own all four. The problem also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. But the question is asking for the number of residents who own all four. \n\nHmm, I think this is a problem about sets and their intersections. Maybe I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the three-set intersections, and so on. \n\nBut wait, in this problem, we have four sets: candy hearts, diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. But since every resident owns a candy heart, that might complicate things. Let me think. Oh, wait, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's a given for everyone. So, the four items are: candy hearts (which everyone has), diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades.\n\nBut the way the problem is phrased, it's about ownership of the other three items, plus the candy hearts. So, when it says 195 own a diamond ring, that includes those who might also own other things, right? Because candy hearts are already included in everyone.\n\nSo, perhaps I should model this using four sets: C (candy hearts), D (diamond rings), G (golf clubs), and S (spades). But since C is universal (every resident owns it), we can maybe simplify the problem by considering the other three sets D, G, S in relation to C.\n\nWait, but the problem is about owning all four, so maybe I can model it without considering C as a separate set because it's already included in everyone. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, since every resident owns a candy heart, the total number of residents is the same as the union of all four sets. But in this case, the four sets would be the four items, but since everyone owns the candy hearts, the union is just 900. \n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the four items being C, D, G, S, with C being the set of all 900. Then, D, G, S are subsets of C. So, we can model the ownership of D, G, S within C.\n\nBut the problem gives me the number of people owning exactly two of the things and exactly three. But since everyone has C, when they say exactly two, does that include C or not? Hmm, this is a crucial point. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem states: \"there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\" It says \"these things,\" which refers to the four items mentioned: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, the exact counts include all four items.\n\nWait, so when it says exactly two, it could be any two of the four, including the candy hearts. Similarly, exactly three includes any three, including the candy hearts. But wait, but if someone owns exactly three things, and one of them is the candy heart, which everyone has, that's possible. \n\nBut wait, since everyone owns the candy hearts, is it possible to own exactly two things without including the candy hearts? No, because if you don't count the candy hearts, then you would be owning zero of the other things, but that's not the case. Wait, no, because the other things are D, G, S. So, owning exactly two things could mean, for example, owning D and G but not S or C. Wait, but since C is already owned by everyone, if you own D and G, you must have C as well. So, in reality, when the problem says \"exactly two of these things,\" it's referring to exactly two of the four items, which includes C. So, someone who owns exactly two things would have, for example, C and D, but not G or S. Similarly, someone who owns exactly three things would have C, D, and G, but not S, and so on.\n\nBut that complicates the matter because the candy hearts are already included in everyone. So, perhaps I should model it as the other three items. Let me clarify: Let me consider the four items as four sets. However, since all 900 residents are in the set C (candy hearts), we can model the problem using the other three sets D, G, S. \n\nWait, but the problem is about all four items. So, perhaps it's better to think of the problem as having four sets, where the universal set is C, which has 900 elements. The other sets D, G, S are subsets of C. The problem then gives us the counts for D, G, S, and the counts for exactly two and exactly three of all four items.\n\nWait, maybe I can approach this by considering the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets, but it's a bit complicated. Alternatively, since the candy hearts are already included in everyone, perhaps I can model the problem in terms of D, G, S, and the overlaps.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- Total residents, T = 900.\n\n- Number of people owning D = 195.\n\n- Number owning G = 367.\n\n- Number owning S = 562.\n\n- Number owning exactly two of the four items = 437.\n\n- Number owning exactly three of the four items = 234.\n\nWe need to find the number owning all four, which is the intersection of D, G, S, and C. But since C is everyone, that's just the intersection of D, G, S.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the inclusion-exclusion for the three sets D, G, S, with the universal set C.\n\nWait, but the problem gives the counts for exactly two and exactly three of all four items. Hmm, maybe I should model it differently.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the four items as four sets: C, D, G, S. Since C is the universal set, the problem is about the overlaps among D, G, S within C.\n\nBut the problem states that 437 own exactly two of the four things, and 234 own exactly three. So, these counts include C as one of the four. So, for example, someone who owns exactly two things could be C and D, or C and G, etc.\n\nWait, but that complicates the analysis because the number of exactly two includes combinations that include C. So, perhaps it's better to model it as four sets and use inclusion-exclusion for the four sets.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to structure this using the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. The formula for the union of four sets is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |C\u2229D| - |C\u2229G| - |C\u2229S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |C\u2229D\u2229G| + |C\u2229D\u2229S| + |C\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| - |C\u2229D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nBut wait, since C is the universal set, the union of D, G, S, and C is just C, which has 900 elements. So, |D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = |C| = 900.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful yet. Let me write down the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |C\u2229D| - |C\u2229G| - |C\u2229S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |C\u2229D\u2229G| + |C\u2229D\u2229S| + |C\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| - |C\u2229D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nBut since |D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = |C| = 900, we can write:\n\n900 = 900 + |D| + |G| + |S| - |C\u2229D| - |C\u2229G| - |C\u2229S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |C\u2229D\u2229G| + |C\u2229D\u2229S| + |C\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| - |C\u2229D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nWait, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can rearrange this equation.\n\nSubtracting 900 from both sides:\n\n0 = |D| + |G| + |S| - |C\u2229D| - |C\u2229G| - |C\u2229S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |C\u2229D\u2229G| + |C\u2229D\u2229S| + |C\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| - |C\u2229D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps I can find another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this problem using the counts of exactly two and exactly three, and then use the inclusion-exclusion principle in a different way.\n\nLet me recall that for three sets, the inclusion-exclusion formula is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nBut in our case, since we have four sets, but C is universal, maybe we can focus on the other three.\n\nWait, but the problem gives the counts of people owning exactly two and exactly three of all four items. So, perhaps it's better to consider all four items, but since C is universal, the counts for exactly two and exactly three are a bit different.\n\nLet me think about the number of people owning exactly two of the four items. Since everyone owns C, the possible pairs are:\n\n- C and D\n\n- C and G\n\n- C and S\n\n- D and G\n\n- D and S\n\n- G and S\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three would be:\n\n- C, D, G\n\n- C, D, S\n\n- C, G, S\n\n- D, G, S\n\nAnd the number owning all four is C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, perhaps I can denote the following variables:\n\nLet a = number owning exactly C and D (and nothing else).\n\nb = exactly C and G.\n\nc = exactly C and S.\n\nd = exactly D and G (and nothing else).\n\ne = exactly D and S.\n\nf = exactly G and S.\n\ng = exactly C, D, G.\n\nh = exactly C, D, S.\n\ni = exactly C, G, S.\n\nj = exactly D, G, S.\n\nk = exactly C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, the total number of people owning exactly two is a + b + c + d + e + f = 437.\n\nThe total number of people owning exactly three is g + h + i + j = 234.\n\nAnd the number owning all four is k.\n\nNow, the total number of people is the sum of all these categories plus those who own only C, but the problem says everyone owns C, so the only way someone doesn't own any of D, G, S is if they own only C. But the problem doesn't mention how many own only C. Wait, but the total number of people is 900, so:\n\nNumber owning only C = 900 - (a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j + k).\n\nWait, but that might complicate things. Let me see if I can find another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the counts of D, G, S.\n\nThe number of people owning D is 195. This includes those who own only D, those who own D and another item, and those who own D and two others, and those who own all four.\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nSo, the count for D is:\n\nNumber owning only D (but since everyone owns C, this would be people owning only D and C, which is a). Wait, no, because if someone owns only D and C, that's exactly two items. So, the count for D includes:\n\na (C and D)\n\nd (D and G)\n\ne (D and S)\n\ng (C, D, G)\n\nh (C, D, S)\n\nj (D, G, S)\n\nk (all four)\n\nSimilarly, the count for D is a + d + e + g + h + j + k.\n\nWait, but that seems complicated. Let me try to write equations for each set.\n\nFor D:\n\n|D| = a + d + e + g + h + j + k = 195.\n\nFor G:\n\n|G| = b + d + f + g + i + j + k = 367.\n\nFor S:\n\n|S| = c + e + f + h + i + j + k = 562.\n\nHmm, that's a lot of variables. But perhaps I can find another way using the given data.\n\nWait, I also know that the number of people owning exactly two is 437, which is a + b + c + d + e + f = 437.\n\nThe number of people owning exactly three is 234, which is g + h + i + j = 234.\n\nAnd the number owning all four is k.\n\nNow, perhaps I can find the sum of |D| + |G| + |S|.\n\nThat would be 195 + 367 + 562 = let's calculate that.\n\n195 + 367 = 562, plus 562 is 1124.\n\nSo, |D| + |G| + |S| = 1124.\n\nNow, let's express |D| + |G| + |S| in terms of the variables.\n\nFrom the earlier breakdown:\n\n|D| = a + d + e + g + h + j + k.\n\nSimilarly for |G| and |S|.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n|D| + |G| + |S| = (a + d + e + g + h + j + k) + (b + d + f + g + i + j + k) + (c + e + f + h + i + j + k).\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n= a + d + e + g + h + j + k + b + d + f + g + i + j + k + c + e + f + h + i + j + k.\n\nNow, let's collect like terms:\n\na + b + c = sum of exactly two in C and one other.\n\nd appears twice (from D and G): 2d.\n\ne appears twice (from D and S): 2e.\n\nf appears twice (from G and S): 2f.\n\ng appears twice (from D and G): 2g.\n\nh appears twice (from D and S): 2h.\n\ni appears twice (from G and S): 2i.\n\nj appears three times (from D, G, S).\n\nk appears three times (from D, G, S).\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nLooking at each term:\n\n- a, b, c: each appears once.\n\n- d: appears in D and G, so twice.\n\n- e: appears in D and S, so twice.\n\n- f: appears in G and S, so twice.\n\n- g: appears in D and G, so twice.\n\n- h: appears in D and S, so twice.\n\n- i: appears in G and S, so twice.\n\n- j: appears in D, G, and S, so three times.\n\n- k: appears in D, G, and S, so three times.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n|D| + |G| + |S| = (a + b + c) + 2(d + e + f) + 2(g + h + i) + 3j + 3k.\n\nWe know that |D| + |G| + |S| = 1124.\n\nSo,\n\n(a + b + c) + 2(d + e + f) + 2(g + h + i) + 3j + 3k = 1124.\n\nNow, from the problem, we know that the number of people owning exactly two is 437, which is a + b + c + d + e + f = 437.\n\nLet me denote this as equation (1): a + b + c + d + e + f = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three is 234, which is g + h + i + j = 234. Let's call this equation (2): g + h + i + j = 234.\n\nAlso, the number of people owning all four is k, which is our target.\n\nSo, let's see if we can express the previous equation in terms of these variables.\n\nOur equation from |D| + |G| + |S| is:\n\n(a + b + c) + 2(d + e + f) + 2(g + h + i) + 3j + 3k = 1124.\n\nLet me rewrite this:\n\n(a + b + c) + 2(d + e + f) + 2(g + h + i) + 3(j + k) = 1124.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can substitute some of these sums using equations (1) and (2).\n\nFrom equation (1): a + b + c = 437 - (d + e + f).\n\nSimilarly, from equation (2): g + h + i = 234 - j.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n(437 - (d + e + f)) + 2(d + e + f) + 2(234 - j) + 3(j + k) = 1124.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, expand:\n\n437 - d - e - f + 2d + 2e + 2f + 2*234 - 2j + 3j + 3k = 1124.\n\nNow, let's compute the constants and combine like terms.\n\n437 + (2*234) = 437 + 468 = 905.\n\nThen, the terms involving d, e, f:\n\n(-d - e - f) + (2d + 2e + 2f) = ( (-1 + 2)d ) + ( (-1 + 2)e ) + ( (-1 + 2)f ) = d + e + f.\n\nThe terms involving j:\n\n-2j + 3j = j.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n905 + (d + e + f) + j + 3k = 1124.\n\nNow, let's rearrange:\n\nd + e + f + j + 3k = 1124 - 905 = 219.\n\nSo, equation (3): d + e + f + j + 3k = 219.\n\nHmm, but I don't know what d, e, f, j are individually. Let me see if I can find another equation involving these variables.\n\nWait, from equation (2): g + h + i + j = 234. So, j = 234 - (g + h + i).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps yet.\n\nWait, another approach: The total number of residents is 900. Let's express that in terms of the variables.\n\nTotal residents = number of people owning only C + exactly two items + exactly three items + all four items.\n\nBut wait, no, because the problem includes all four items. So, the only people not owning any of D, G, S are those who own only C. Let me denote that as m.\n\nSo,\n\nm + (a + b + c + d + e + f) + (g + h + i + j) + k = 900.\n\nWhich is:\n\nm + 437 + 234 + k = 900.\n\nSo,\n\nm + k = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, m + k = 229.\n\nBut I don't know m or k yet.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I can find another equation involving d, e, f, j, etc.\n\nWait, let's go back to equation (3): d + e + f + j + 3k = 219.\n\nIs there a way to express d + e + f + j in terms of other variables?\n\nWait, perhaps I can find another equation. Let me think about the sum of the pairwise intersections.\n\nThe sum of pairwise intersections for D, G, S is |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|.\n\nEach of these intersections includes people who own exactly two of D, G, S, plus those who own three or all four.\n\nFor example:\n\n|D\u2229G| = number of people owning both D and G, which includes those who own exactly D and G (d), plus those who own D, G, and C (g), plus those who own D, G, and S (j), plus those who own all four (k).\n\nWait, no, because if someone owns all four, they're included in every pairwise intersection.\n\nSo, |D\u2229G| = d + g + j + k.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n|D\u2229S| = e + h + j + k,\n\n|G\u2229S| = f + i + j + k.\n\nSo, the sum |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| = (d + g + j + k) + (e + h + j + k) + (f + i + j + k).\n\n= d + e + f + g + h + i + 3j + 3k.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets. Let me consider D, G, S as three sets within C.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nBut we don't know |D \u222a G \u222a S|, but perhaps we can express it in terms of the variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can relate this to the total number of people, which is 900.\n\nWait, the union of D, G, S is the number of people who own at least one of D, G, or S. Since everyone owns C, the number of people who own at least one of D, G, S is equal to the total number of people minus those who own only C. So,\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - m.\n\nAnd since m + k = 229, we can write |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - (229 - k) = 900 - 229 + k = 671 + k.\n\nSo,\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 671 + k.\n\nNow, using the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nWe know |D| = 195, |G|=367, |S|=562. So,\n\n671 + k = 195 + 367 + 562 - (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|) + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nLet me compute 195 + 367 + 562. That's 195 + 367 = 562, plus 562 is 1124. So,\n\n671 + k = 1124 - (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|) + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nRearranging,\n\n|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| = 1124 - (671 + k) + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nWait, but |D\u2229G\u2229S| is the number of people who own all three D, G, S, which is j + k. Because j is exactly three (D, G, S), and k is all four, which includes C as well. So, |D\u2229G\u2229S| = j + k.\n\nWait, no, because |D\u2229G\u2229S| is the number of people who own D, G, and S, regardless of C. But since everyone owns C, |D\u2229G\u2229S| is the same as the number of people who own all three D, G, S, which includes those who own exactly three (j) and those who own all four (k). So, |D\u2229G\u2229S| = j + k.\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| = 1124 - (671 + k) + (j + k).\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 1124 - 671 - k + j + k\n\n= 1124 - 671 + j\n\n= 453 + j.\n\nSo,\n\n|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| = 453 + j.\n\nBut earlier, we found that |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| = d + e + f + g + h + i + 3j + 3k.\n\nWait, no, earlier when we expanded |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|, we had:\n\n= (d + g + j + k) + (e + h + j + k) + (f + i + j + k)\n\n= d + e + f + g + h + i + 3j + 3k.\n\nSo,\n\nd + e + f + g + h + i + 3j + 3k = 453 + j.\n\nHmm, let's rearrange this equation:\n\nd + e + f + g + h + i + 3j + 3k - j = 453.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nd + e + f + g + h + i + 2j + 3k = 453.\n\nNow, from equation (2), g + h + i + j = 234. Let me denote this as:\n\ng + h + i = 234 - j.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nd + e + f + (234 - j) + 2j + 3k = 453.\n\nSimplify:\n\nd + e + f + 234 + j + 3k = 453.\n\nSo,\n\nd + e + f + j + 3k = 453 - 234 = 219.\n\nWait, that's the same as equation (3): d + e + f + j + 3k = 219.\n\nSo, that doesn't give us new information. Hmm, maybe I need another approach.\n\nWait, I have equation (3): d + e + f + j + 3k = 219.\n\nAnd I also have equation (2): g + h + i + j = 234.\n\nI think I need another equation to relate these variables. Let me think about the total number of people who own exactly two, exactly three, all four, and only C.\n\nFrom earlier, m + 437 + 234 + k = 900.\n\nSo, m + k = 229.\n\nBut I don't know m or k. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find another equation by considering the sum of the pairwise intersections.\n\nWait, I think I'm stuck here. Maybe I can try to express everything in terms of k.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFrom equation (3): d + e + f + j + 3k = 219.\n\nFrom equation (2): g + h + i + j = 234.\n\nSo, perhaps I can subtract equation (2) from equation (3) to find a relationship between d + e + f and g + h + i.\n\nWait, equation (3): d + e + f + j + 3k = 219.\n\nEquation (2): g + h + i + j = 234.\n\nSubtracting equation (2) from equation (3):\n\n(d + e + f) - (g + h + i) + 3k = 219 - 234.\n\nSo,\n\n(d + e + f) - (g + h + i) + 3k = -15.\n\nHmm, but I don't know if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express (d + e + f) as (g + h + i) - 15 - 3k.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I can express (d + e + f) in terms of equation (1).\n\nFrom equation (1): a + b + c + d + e + f = 437.\n\nSo, (d + e + f) = 437 - (a + b + c).\n\nHmm, but I don't know a, b, c.\n\nThis is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that the number of people owning exactly two is 437, which includes all pairs. So, the sum of all pairwise exactly-two counts is 437.\n\nBut each pairwise exactly-two count is:\n\na (C and D),\n\nb (C and G),\n\nc (C and S),\n\nd (D and G),\n\ne (D and S),\n\nf (G and S).\n\nSo, a + b + c + d + e + f = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three is 234, which includes:\n\ng (C, D, G),\n\nh (C, D, S),\n\ni (C, G, S),\n\nj (D, G, S).\n\nSo, g + h + i + j = 234.\n\nAnd the number of people owning all four is k.\n\nNow, perhaps I can think about the sum of all possible intersections.\n\nWait, the sum of all possible intersections for two sets is |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|.\n\nEach of these intersections includes:\n\n- Those who own exactly two of D, G, S: d, e, f.\n\n- Those who own three of them: g, h, i, j.\n\n- Those who own all four: k.\n\nSo,\n\n|D\u2229G| = d + g + j + k,\n\n|D\u2229S| = e + h + j + k,\n\n|G\u2229S| = f + i + j + k.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| = (d + e + f) + (g + h + i) + 3j + 3k.\n\nBut earlier, we found that this sum is equal to 453 + j.\n\nSo,\n\n(d + e + f) + (g + h + i) + 3j + 3k = 453 + j.\n\nRearranging,\n\n(d + e + f) + (g + h + i) + 2j + 3k = 453.\n\nHmm, and from equation (2), g + h + i = 234 - j.\n\nSubstituting,\n\n(d + e + f) + (234 - j) + 2j + 3k = 453.\n\nSimplify:\n\nd + e + f + 234 + j + 3k = 453.\n\nSo,\n\nd + e + f + j + 3k = 453 - 234 = 219.\n\nWhich brings us back to equation (3): d + e + f + j + 3k = 219.\n\nHmm, so I'm going in circles here. Maybe I need to find another equation involving these variables.\n\nWait, I also have the sum of |D| + |G| + |S| = 1124.\n\nEarlier, we expressed this as:\n\n(a + b + c) + 2(d + e + f) + 2(g + h + i) + 3j + 3k = 1124.\n\nBut from equation (1), a + b + c = 437 - (d + e + f).\n\nFrom equation (2), g + h + i = 234 - j.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n(437 - (d + e + f)) + 2(d + e + f) + 2(234 - j) + 3j + 3k = 1124.\n\nSimplify:\n\n437 - d - e - f + 2d + 2e + 2f + 468 - 2j + 3j + 3k = 1124.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n437 + 468 = 905.\n\n(-d - e - f) + (2d + 2e + 2f) = d + e + f.\n\n(-2j + 3j) = j.\n\nSo,\n\n905 + (d + e + f) + j + 3k = 1124.\n\nWhich gives:\n\nd + e + f + j + 3k = 219.\n\nWhich is equation (3) again.\n\nHmm, so no progress there.\n\nWait, maybe I can express (d + e + f) from equation (3):\n\nd + e + f = 219 - j - 3k.\n\nNow, from equation (1): a + b + c + d + e + f = 437.\n\nSubstituting (d + e + f):\n\na + b + c + (219 - j - 3k) = 437.\n\nSo,\n\na + b + c = 437 - (219 - j - 3k) = 437 - 219 + j + 3k = 218 + j + 3k.\n\nNow, let's consider the sum of |D| + |G| + |S| again, but perhaps I can find another way.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's think about the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S. As I thought earlier, this is |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - m.\n\nAnd from the inclusion-exclusion formula, this is also equal to |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nWhich we found earlier to be 1124 - (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|) + (j + k).\n\nBut we also found that |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| = 453 + j.\n\nSo,\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 1124 - (453 + j) + (j + k) = 1124 - 453 - j + j + k = 671 + k.\n\nWhich matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 671 + k.\n\nBut we also know that |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - m.\n\nAnd from earlier, m + k = 229, so m = 229 - k.\n\nThus,\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - (229 - k) = 671 + k.\n\nWhich matches what we had before.\n\nHmm, I'm not making progress. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that the number of people owning exactly two items is 437, which includes all the pairwise exactly-two counts. So, maybe I can find the sum of all exactly-two counts for D, G, S, excluding C.\n\nWait, but the exactly-two counts include C as well. So, for example, a is the count of people owning exactly C and D, which is a subset of D.\n\nSimilarly, d is the count of people owning exactly D and G, which doesn't include C. Wait, no, because C is already included in everyone, so if someone owns D and G, they must also own C, so d would be the count of people owning exactly D, G, and C. So, d is part of exactly three items.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nIf someone owns exactly two items, and C is one of them, then they own exactly two items: C and one other. So, a is C and D, b is C and G, c is C and S.\n\nIf someone owns exactly two items without C, that's impossible because C is already owned by everyone. So, the only way someone owns exactly two items is if they own C and one other item.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point! Because C is already included in everyone, you can't have someone owning exactly two items without including C. So, the exactly-two counts are all combinations that include C. Therefore, the 437 residents who own exactly two things are those who own C and exactly one other item. So, a + b + c = 437.\n\nWait, that changes everything! I think I made a mistake earlier by considering exactly-two counts that don't include C. But since C is already owned by everyone, you can't have exactly two items without including C. So, the exactly-two counts are only C paired with one other item. So, a + b + c = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the exactly-three counts would be people who own C and exactly two other items, plus those who own exactly three items without C. Wait, but again, since everyone owns C, the exactly-three counts would include C plus two others, and also those who own all three of D, G, S. Wait, no, because if someone owns all three of D, G, S, they must also own C, so that's four items. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\n- Exactly two items: since C is already included, exactly two items would mean C plus one other. So, exactly two items are C and D, C and G, or C and S. So, a + b + c = 437.\n\n- Exactly three items: since C is already included, exactly three would mean C plus two others. So, the possibilities are C, D, G; C, D, S; C, G, S. So, g + h + i = 234.\n\nWait, but the problem states that 234 own exactly three of the four items, which includes C. So, those 234 are the ones who own exactly three, which would be the sum of g + h + i. Because j (D, G, S) would be the ones who own all four, since they also have C.\n\nWait, no, if someone owns D, G, S, they must also own C, so j would actually be part of the all-four category, which is k. So, j = k. Because if someone owns D, G, S, they also own C, so they're in the all-four category.\n\nWait, that's a key point. So, j (D, G, S) would actually be the same as k (all four), because they have to have C as well. So, j = k.\n\nWait, but in our earlier definitions, j was exactly D, G, S, without C. But since everyone owns C, j must be zero. So, no one can own exactly D, G, S without C; they must own all four. So, j = 0.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the exactly-three counts are only those who own C plus two others. So, g + h + i = 234.\n\nAnd j = 0, because j was the count of people owning exactly D, G, S, which is impossible since they must own C as well. So, j = 0.\n\nThat simplifies things a lot.\n\nSo, let's redefine:\n\nExactly two items: a + b + c = 437.\n\nExactly three items: g + h + i = 234.\n\nExactly four items: k.\n\nAnd j = 0.\n\nNow, let's go back to the equation (3): d + e + f + j + 3k = 219.\n\nSince j = 0, this becomes:\n\nd + e + f + 3k = 219.\n\nBut what are d, e, f?\n\nWait, earlier, I defined:\n\nd = exactly D and G.\n\ne = exactly D and S.\n\nf = exactly G and S.\n\nBut if someone owns exactly D and G, they must also own C, because everyone owns C. So, d is the number of people who own exactly C, D, and G, which is part of the exactly-three counts. So, d = g.\n\nWait, no, because exactly three counts are those who own C plus two others. So, if someone owns exactly D and G, they must also own C, making it exactly three items, which is g (C, D, G). So, d = g.\n\nSimilarly, e = exactly D and S would be h (C, D, S).\n\nAnd f = exactly G and S would be i (C, G, S).\n\nWait, so d = g, e = h, f = i.\n\nSo, from the exactly-three counts: g + h + i = 234.\n\nWhich is the same as d + e + f = 234.\n\nWait, but earlier, equation (3) after substituting j=0 is:\n\nd + e + f + 3k = 219.\n\nBut d + e + f = 234.\n\nSo,\n\n234 + 3k = 219.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 234 + 3k = 219 implies 3k = -15, which is impossible since k can't be negative.\n\nHmm, that suggests I made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, let's go back. If d is the number of people owning exactly D and G, but since they must also own C, d is actually part of the exactly-three counts. So, d = g.\n\nSimilarly, e = h, and f = i.\n\nSo, d + e + f = g + h + i = 234.\n\nBut from equation (3): d + e + f + 3k = 219.\n\nSubstituting d + e + f = 234:\n\n234 + 3k = 219 \u2192 3k = -15 \u2192 k = -5.\n\nThat's impossible because the number of people can't be negative. So, I must have made a mistake in my definitions.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial assumption that j = 0 is incorrect. Because j was defined as exactly D, G, S, but since everyone owns C, j would actually be part of the all-four category, which is k. So, j = k.\n\nSo, in equation (2): g + h + i + j = 234 \u2192 g + h + i + k = 234.\n\nAnd equation (3): d + e + f + j + 3k = 219 \u2192 d + e + f + k + 3k = 219 \u2192 d + e + f + 4k = 219.\n\nBut earlier, I thought d = g, e = h, f = i, but that leads to a contradiction. So, perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps d, e, f are the counts of people who own exactly two of D, G, S, but not C. But that's impossible because everyone owns C. So, d, e, f must be zero. That would mean that all pairwise intersections include C.\n\nWait, but that can't be because then the pairwise intersections would be part of the exactly-three counts.\n\nI'm getting really confused here. Maybe I need to redefine the variables correctly.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nSince everyone owns C, the possible ownerships are:\n\n- Only C: m.\n\n- Exactly two items: C and one other (a, b, c).\n\n- Exactly three items: C and two others (g, h, i).\n\n- All four items: C, D, G, S (k).\n\nSo, in this case, there are no people who own exactly two items without C, and no one owns exactly three items without C. So, the exactly-two counts are a + b + c = 437.\n\nThe exactly-three counts are g + h + i = 234.\n\nAnd the all-four count is k.\n\nNow, the pairwise intersections:\n\n|D\u2229G| includes:\n\n- a (C and D and G? No, a is C and D, but not G. So, a is C and D only.\n\nWait, no, |D\u2229G| includes all people who own both D and G, regardless of other items. So, that includes:\n\n- Those who own exactly D, G, and C: g.\n\n- Those who own D, G, C, and possibly S: but if they own S, they would be in the all-four category, which is k.\n\nWait, so |D\u2229G| = g + k.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n|D\u2229S| = h + k,\n\n|G\u2229S| = i + k.\n\nSo, the sum of pairwise intersections is:\n\n|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| = (g + k) + (h + k) + (i + k) = g + h + i + 3k.\n\nBut from the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets, we have:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nWe know |D| = 195, |G|=367, |S|=562.\n\nSo,\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - (g + h + i + 3k) + (k).\n\nWait, because |D\u2229G\u2229S| is the number of people who own all three D, G, S, which would be k, since they also own C.\n\nSo,\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 1124 - (g + h + i + 3k) + k = 1124 - g - h - i - 2k.\n\nBut |D \u222a G \u222a S| is the number of people who own at least one of D, G, S, which is 900 - m.\n\nAnd from earlier, m + k = 229 \u2192 m = 229 - k.\n\nSo,\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - (229 - k) = 671 + k.\n\nPutting it together:\n\n671 + k = 1124 - (g + h + i) - 2k.\n\nBut from equation (2): g + h + i = 234.\n\nSo,\n\n671 + k = 1124 - 234 - 2k.\n\nSimplify:\n\n671 + k = 890 - 2k.\n\nAdding 2k to both sides:\n\n671 + 3k = 890.\n\nSubtracting 671:\n\n3k = 890 - 671 = 219.\n\nSo,\n\nk = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nSo, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the ownership of items among the 900 residents of Aimeville, where everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (C). We are given the counts of residents owning diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), and garden spades (S), as well as those owning exactly two or three of the four items. We aim to find the number of residents who own all four items.\n\n### Key Definitions:\n- **Exactly two items**: Residents who own exactly C and one other item (D, G, or S). This sum is 437.\n- **Exactly three items**: Residents who own exactly C and two other items (D, G, or S). This sum is 234.\n- **All four items**: Residents who own C, D, G, and S. This is the unknown value we aim to find, denoted as \\( k \\).\n\n### Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets (D, G, S) within the universal set C, we calculate the union of D, G, and S:\n\n\\[\n|D \\cup G \\cup S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \\cap G| - |D \\cap S| - |G \\cap S| + |D \\cap G \\cap S|\n\\]\n\nSince everyone owns C, the union \\( |D \\cup G \\cup S| \\) represents the number of residents who own at least one of D, G, or S. This is equal to the total residents minus those who own only C:\n\n\\[\n|D \\cup G \\cup S| = 900 - m\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the number of residents who own only C. From the problem, \\( m + k = 229 \\), so \\( m = 229 - k \\).\n\n### Pairwise Intersections:\nThe pairwise intersections \\( |D \\cap G| \\), \\( |D \\cap S| \\), and \\( |G \\cap S| \\) include residents who own exactly two of D, G, S (along with C) and those who own all four items. Thus:\n\n\\[\n|D \\cap G| = g + k, \\quad |D \\cap S| = h + k, \\quad |G \\cap S| = i + k\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( g, h, i \\) are the counts of residents owning exactly three items (C and two others).\n\n### Substituting Values:\nWe know:\n- \\( |D| = 195 \\), \\( |G| = 367 \\), \\( |S| = 562 \\)\n- \\( g + h + i = 234 \\) (exactly three items)\n- \\( a + b + c = 437 \\) (exactly two items)\n\nThe sum of pairwise intersections is:\n\n\\[\n|D \\cap G| + |D \\cap S| + |G \\cap S| = (g + k) + (h + k) + (i + k) = g + h + i + 3k = 234 + 3k\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\n\\[\n|D \\cup G \\cup S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - (234 + 3k) + k = 1124 - 234 - 2k = 890 - 2k\n\\]\n\nSince \\( |D \\cup G \\cup S| = 671 + k \\) (from \\( 900 - m = 671 + k \\)):\n\n\\[\n671 + k = 890 - 2k\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( k \\):\n\n\\[\n3k = 890 - 671 = 219 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k = \\frac{219}{3} = 73\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe number of residents who own all four items is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{73}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about the residents of Aimeville. There are 900 people in total. Each person owns some combination of four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. I need to find out how many residents own all four of these things.\n\nLet me start by listing out all the given information. The total number of residents is 900. The number of people who own each item is as follows: diamond rings (195), golf clubs (367), garden spades (562), and every resident owns a bag of candy hearts. Wait, that's interesting because the candy hearts are owned by everyone, so that might be a key point.\n\nNow, the problem also states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. I'm supposed to find the number who own all four. Hmm, okay. So I think this is a problem about sets and using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. \n\nLet me recall the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. The formula for the union of four sets A, B, C, D is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |A\u2229D| - |B\u2229C| - |B\u2229D| - |C\u2229D| + |A\u2229B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229D| + |A\u2229C\u2229D| + |B\u2229C\u2229D| - |A\u2229B\u2229C\u2229D|\n\nBut wait, in this problem, we know that everyone owns at least one item because the candy hearts are owned by all 900. So the union of all four sets is 900. So, |A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = 900.\n\nLet me write down the given data:\n\n- |A| = 195 (diamond rings)\n- |B| = 367 (golf clubs)\n- |C| = 562 (garden spades)\n- |D| = 900 (candy hearts)\n- Number of people owning exactly two items: 437\n- Number owning exactly three items: 234\n- Number owning all four: Let's denote this as x (which we need to find)\n\nWait, but in the inclusion-exclusion formula, we have terms for all possible intersections. But how does the information about exactly two and exactly three items relate to this?\n\nI remember that in inclusion-exclusion, the terms for pairwise intersections (like |A\u2229B|) include those who own exactly A and B, plus those who own A, B, and possibly another item. So, if I can express the pairwise intersections in terms of the number of people owning exactly two or three items, that might help.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this using the principle where we count the total number of elements in the union, but considering overlaps. Alternatively, maybe using the concept of the sum of all subsets.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the sum of the sizes of all the individual sets and then subtract the overlaps appropriately.\n\nWait, let me think about the standard inclusion-exclusion formula. Let me denote:\n\n- a = number owning exactly 1 item\n- b = exactly 2 items\n- c = exactly 3 items\n- d = exactly 4 items\n\nWe know that the total number of people is a + b + c + d = 900.\n\nWe also know that b = 437, c = 234, and d = x (what we're looking for). So a = 900 - 437 - 234 - x.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that helps yet. Maybe I need another equation.\n\nWait, another way to think about this is to compute the sum of the sizes of each individual set. So |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| is equal to the sum over each individual's number of items they own. Each person owns 1, 2, 3, or 4 items. So |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| = a*1 + b*2 + c*3 + d*4.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nSum of individual set sizes:\n\n|A| = 195\n|B| = 367\n|C| = 562\n|D| = 900\n\nSo sum = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900. Let me calculate that.\n\n195 + 367 = 562\n562 + 562 = 1124\n1124 + 900 = 2024\n\nSo the sum is 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, the sum is also a*1 + b*2 + c*3 + d*4.\n\nWe know a = 900 - 437 - 234 - x = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x.\n\nSo, sum = (229 - x)*1 + 437*2 + 234*3 + x*4.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n(229 - x) = 229 - x\n437 * 2 = 874\n234 * 3 = 702\nx * 4 = 4x\n\nSo sum = (229 - x) + 874 + 702 + 4x.\n\nAdding the constants: 229 + 874 = 1103; 1103 + 702 = 1805.\n\nAdding the x terms: (-x) + 4x = 3x.\n\nSo sum = 1805 + 3x.\n\nBut we also know that the sum is 2024. So:\n\n1805 + 3x = 2024\n\nSubtract 1805 from both sides:\n\n3x = 2024 - 1805 = 219\n\nSo x = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nWait, so x is 73. That would mean 73 residents own all four items.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through the steps again.\n\n1. Total residents: 900.\n\n2. Number with exactly two items: 437.\n\n3. Exactly three: 234.\n\n4. Let x be exactly four.\n\nSo, a (exactly one) = 900 - 437 - 234 - x = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x.\n\nSum of the individual set sizes:\n\n|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900.\n\nCalculating:\n\n195 + 367: 195 + 300 = 495, 495 + 67 = 562.\n\n562 + 562 = 1124.\n\n1124 + 900 = 2024.\n\nSum is 2024.\n\nAnother way to compute this sum is to count how many items each person owns and sum all these. So each person contributes 1, 2, 3, or 4 to the total. So sum is:\n\na*1 + b*2 + c*3 + d*4.\n\nWhich is (229 - x)*1 + 437*2 + 234*3 + x*4.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(229 - x) = 229 - x.\n\n437*2: 437 * 2 = 874.\n\n234*3: 234 * 3 = 702.\n\nx*4: 4x.\n\nSo sum = (229 - x) + 874 + 702 + 4x.\n\nAdding constants: 229 + 874 = 1103; 1103 + 702 = 1805.\n\nAdding x terms: (-x) + 4x = 3x.\n\nSo total sum is 1805 + 3x.\n\nSet equal to 2024: 1805 + 3x = 2024.\n\nSubtract 1805: 3x = 2024 - 1805.\n\n2024 - 1805: Let's compute that. 2024 - 1800 = 224; 224 - 5 = 219. So 3x = 219.\n\nSo x = 73.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the inclusion-exclusion formula directly.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |A\u2229D| - |B\u2229C| - |B\u2229D| - |C\u2229D| + |A\u2229B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229D| + |A\u2229C\u2229D| + |B\u2229C\u2229D| - |A\u2229B\u2229C\u2229D|.\n\nWe know that |A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = 900, since everyone owns at least one item (the candy hearts). So,\n\n900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - (sum of all pairwise intersections) + (sum of all triple intersections) - (all four intersections).\n\nWait, but this seems complicated because we have a lot of terms. I don't know the individual pairwise or triple intersections. But maybe we can express the sum of the pairwise intersections and the sum of the triple intersections in terms of the given data.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider that the sum of all pairwise intersections can be expressed in terms of the number of people owning exactly two, three, or four items.\n\nWait, because each pairwise intersection includes those who own exactly those two, plus those who own three or four including those two. So, for example, |A\u2229B| includes people who own exactly A and B, plus those who own A, B, and C, and those who own A, B, C, D. Similarly for other pairwise intersections.\n\nBut this might get too complicated. Maybe it's better to stick with the first approach.\n\nWait, in the first approach, we found x = 73. Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nSo, the number of people owning all four is 73. That seems plausible.\n\nWait, another sanity check: the number of people who own exactly three items is 234. So, the number of people owning exactly three items plus those owning all four would be 234 + 73 = 307. Then, the number of people owning exactly two is 437, and exactly one is 229 - 73 = 156. Wait, no, a is 229 - x, so if x is 73, a = 229 -73= 156.\n\nSo, total people would be 156 (exactly one) + 437 (exactly two) + 234 (exactly three) + 73 (exactly four) = 156 + 437 = 593; 593 + 234 = 827; 827 +73=900. That adds up correctly.\n\nSo, the numbers check out.\n\nTherefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n",

So |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| = a*1 + b*2 + c*3 + d*4.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nSum of individual set sizes:\n\n|A| = 195\n|B| = 367\n|C| = 562\n|D| = 900\n\nSo sum = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900. Let me calculate that.\n\n195 + 367 = 562\n562 + 562 = 1124\n1124 + 900 = 2024\n\nSo the sum is 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, the sum is also a*1 + b*2 + c*3 + d*4.\n\nWe know a = 900 - 437 - 234 - x = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x.\n\nSo, sum = (229 - x)*1 + 437*2 + 234*3 + x*4.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n(229 - x) = 229 - x\n437 * 2 = 874\n234 * 3 = 702\nx * 4 = 4x\n\nSo sum = (229 - x) + 874 + 702 + 4x.\n\nAdding the constants: 229 + 874 = 1103; 1103 + 702 = 1805.\n\nAdding the x terms: (-x) + 4x = 3x.\n\nSo sum = 1805 + 3x.\n\nBut we also know that the sum is 2024. So:\n\n1805 + 3x = 2024\n\nSubtract 1805 from both sides:\n\n3x = 2024 - 1805 = 219\n\nSo x = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nWait, so x is 73. That would mean 73 residents own all four items.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through the steps again.\n\n1. Total residents: 900.\n\n2. Number with exactly two items: 437.\n\n3. Exactly three: 234.\n\n4. Let x be exactly four.\n\nSo, a (exactly one) = 900 - 437 - 234 - x = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x.\n\nSum of the individual set sizes:\n\n|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900.\n\nCalculating:\n\n195 + 367: 195 + 300 = 495, 495 + 67 = 562.\n\n562 + 562 = 1124.\n\n1124 + 900 = 2024.\n\nSum is 2024.\n\nAnother way to compute this sum is to count how many items each person owns and sum all these. So each person contributes 1, 2, 3, or 4 to the total. So sum is:\n\na*1 + b*2 + c*3 + d*4.\n\nWhich is (229 - x)*1 + 437*2 + 234*3 + x*4.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(229 - x) = 229 - x.\n\n437*2: 437 * 2 = 874.\n\n234*3: 234 * 3 = 702.\n\nx*4: 4x.\n\nSo sum = (229 - x) + 874 + 702 + 4x.\n\nAdding constants: 229 + 874 = 1103; 1103 + 702 = 1805.\n\nAdding x terms: (-x) + 4x = 3x.\n\nSo total sum is 1805 + 3x.\n\nSet equal to 2024: 1805 + 3x = 2024.\n\nSubtract 1805: 3x = 2024 - 1805.\n\n2024 - 1805: Let's compute that. 2024 - 1800 = 224; 224 - 5 = 219. So 3x = 219.\n\nSo x = 73.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the inclusion-exclusion formula directly.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |A\u2229D| - |B\u2229C| - |B\u2229D| - |C\u2229D| + |A\u2229B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229D| + |A\u2229C\u2229D| + |B\u2229C\u2229D| - |A\u2229B\u2229C\u2229D|.\n\nWe know that |A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = 900, since everyone owns at least one item (the candy hearts). So,\n\n900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - (sum of all pairwise intersections) + (sum of all triple intersections) - (all four intersections).\n\nWait, but this seems complicated because we have a lot of terms. I don't know the individual pairwise or triple intersections. But maybe we can express the sum of the pairwise intersections and the sum of the triple intersections in terms of the given data.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider that the sum of all pairwise intersections can be expressed in terms of the number of people owning exactly two, three, or four items.\n\nWait, because each pairwise intersection includes those who own exactly those two, plus those who own three or four including those two. So, for example, |A\u2229B| includes people who own exactly A and B, plus those who own A, B, and C, and those who own A, B, C, D. Similarly for other pairwise intersections.\n\nBut this might get too complicated. Maybe it's better to stick with the first approach.\n\nWait, in the first approach, we found x = 73. Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nSo, the number of people owning all four is 73. That seems plausible.\n\nWait, another sanity check: the number of people who own exactly three items is 234. So, the number of people owning exactly three items plus those owning all four would be 234 + 73 = 307. Then, the number of people owning exactly two is 437, and exactly one is 229 - 73 = 156. Wait, no, a is 229 - x, so if x is 73, a = 229 -73= 156.\n\nSo, total people would be 156 (exactly one) + 437 (exactly two) + 234 (exactly three) + 73 (exactly four) = 156 + 437 = 593; 593 + 234 = 827; 827 +73=900. That adds up correctly.\n\nSo, the numbers check out.\n\nTherefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given data about the residents of Aimeville.\n\n1. **Total Residents**: 900.\n2. **Owners of each item**:\n   - Diamond rings (A): 195\n   - Golf clubs (B): 367\n   - Garden spades (C): 562\n   - Candy hearts (D): 900 (everyone owns this)\n3. **Residents owning exactly two items**: 437\n4. **Residents owning exactly three items**: 234\n5. **Residents owning all four items**: Let this be \\( x \\).\n\nThe total number of residents is the sum of those owning exactly 1, 2, 3, or 4 items:\n\\[\na + b + c + d = 900\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\( a \\) = exactly 1 item\n- \\( b = 437 \\) = exactly 2 items\n- \\( c = 234 \\) = exactly 3 items\n- \\( d = x \\) = exactly 4 items\n\nThus:\n\\[\na = 900 - 437 - 234 - x = 229 - x\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the sum of the sizes of each individual set:\n\\[\n|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024\n\\]\n\nThis sum can also be expressed as:\n\\[\na \\cdot 1 + b \\cdot 2 + c \\cdot 3 + d \\cdot 4\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\n(229 - x) \\cdot 1 + 437 \\cdot 2 + 234 \\cdot 3 + x \\cdot 4\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\\[\n(229 - x) + 874 + 702 + 4x = 1805 + 3x\n\\]\n\nSetting this equal to 2024:\n\\[\n1805 + 3x = 2024\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\n3x = 219 \\implies x = 73\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four items is **73**.\n\n\\boxed{73}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down. There are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. Then, some own a diamond ring, some a set of golf clubs, some a garden spade, and all have the candy hearts. \n\nThe numbers given are:\n- 195 own a diamond ring.\n- 367 own golf clubs.\n- 562 own a garden spade.\n- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's 900.\n\nThen, it says there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three. I need to find how many own all four.\n\nHmm, okay. So, this sounds like a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall how that works.\n\nInclusion-exclusion is a way to calculate the size of the union of multiple sets by adding up the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on.\n\nBut wait, in this case, we're given the numbers of people who own exactly two or exactly three items. So, maybe I can use that information to find the number who own all four.\n\nLet me denote the sets as follows:\n- Let D be the set of people who own a diamond ring.\n- Let G be those who own golf clubs.\n- Let S be those with a garden spade.\n- Let C be those with candy hearts. But since everyone has candy hearts, C is the universal set here. So, the total number of residents is |C| = 900.\n\nWait, but since C is universal, the number of people who don't own any of the other three items is zero. Because everyone has at least candy hearts. So, that might simplify things.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because in this case, everyone has candy hearts, but the other three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) are optional. So, the total number of people is 900, and each has at least the candy hearts.\n\nSo, when they talk about owning exactly two things, that would include candy hearts and one of the other items. Similarly, exactly three would include candy hearts and two of the other items. And exactly four would include all four.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. If someone owns exactly two things, since everyone has candy hearts, then they must have candy hearts plus exactly one other item. Similarly, exactly three things would be candy hearts plus two other items, and exactly four is all four.\n\nSo, the counts given are:\n- Exactly two: 437. So, these are people who have candy hearts and exactly one other item.\n- Exactly three: 234. These have candy hearts and exactly two other items.\n- Exactly four: what we're trying to find. These have all four.\n\nSo, to model this, let me denote:\n- a = number of people with only D and C.\n- b = number with only G and C.\n- c = number with only S and C.\n- d = number with D and G and C.\n- e = number with D and S and C.\n- f = number with G and S and C.\n- g = number with D, G, S, and C. That's the number we need to find.\n\nWait, but I might be complicating it. Alternatively, since each person must have at least C, we can model the problem by considering the other three items as optional, and C is always present.\n\nSo, the problem is about the number of people owning subsets of {D, G, S}, with C always included.\n\nSo, the total number of people is the sum of those owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, or all four of D, G, S, and C.\n\nBut in the problem, it's stated that 437 own exactly two things. Since C is always owned, exactly two things would mean owning one of the other three plus C. So, these are people with exactly one other item.\n\nSimilarly, 234 own exactly three things, which would mean owning two of the other three plus C.\n\nAnd the number of people who own all four is what we need to find. Let's denote this as x.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to model this using the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nLet me think about the total number of people.\n\nThe total number is 900.\n\nThe number of people owning each item:\n- D: 195\n- G: 367\n- S: 562\n- C: 900 (but since C is universal, it's redundant)\n\nWait, but when applying inclusion-exclusion, we can consider the counts for D, G, S, and then account for overlaps.\n\nWait, but in inclusion-exclusion, the formula for three sets is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nBut since everyone owns C, and we're considering D, G, S as the other items, perhaps it's better to model the number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S. Because all 900 own C, but some may not own any of D, G, S. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention how many own none of D, G, S. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, but some may own none of the other three. Wait, but the problem doesn't state that. So, maybe it's possible that some residents don't own any of D, G, or S. But the problem doesn't give the number for that. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all 900 residents own at least one of D, G, or S, because the problem talks about people owning exactly two or three of the things, but it doesn't say anything about people owning none. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can proceed without knowing the number of people who own none. Let me try to think.\n\nWait, let me try to model this using the inclusion-exclusion for three sets, but considering that the total number of people is 900. Since all own C, but the other items are D, G, S.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking about the union of D, G, S, and C, but since C is universal, the union is just 900. So, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the problem in terms of the counts of people owning exactly 1, 2, 3, or 4 items. Since C is always present, the number of people owning exactly k of D, G, S is equal to the number of people owning exactly k+1 items in total (since C is always there).\n\nWait, so if someone owns exactly one of D, G, S, that would mean they have C plus one, so exactly two items in total. Similarly, owning exactly two of D, G, S would mean they have C plus two, so exactly three items in total. And owning all three (D, G, S) would mean they have C plus three, so four items in total.\n\nWait, but the problem says 437 own exactly two of the things. So, if exactly two refers to exactly two of the four things (C, D, G, S), then that would include C and one other. Because if someone has exactly two, they must have C and one more.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says, \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, the four things are C, D, G, S. So, when it says 437 own exactly two, that could mean any two of the four. But since C is always present, perhaps that's not the case. Wait, no. If a resident has exactly two of the four, that could be any two, including C and another. So, perhaps the counts include C.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.\n\nLet me denote the four items as A, B, C, D, but wait, in the problem, the four are C (candy hearts), D (diamond ring), G (golf clubs), S (garden spade). So, each resident has at least C, but may have 0, 1, 2, or 3 of the other items.\n\nWait, but the problem says 437 own exactly two of these things. So, that could be two including C. So, for example, C and D, or C and G, etc. Similarly, 234 own exactly three, which would be C plus two others, and some own all four (C, D, G, S), which is what we're looking for.\n\nSo, the problem is about the number of residents who own exactly 2, 3, or 4 items, where the items are C, D, G, S. But since C is always owned, the counts of exactly two, exactly three, exactly four are based on how many of D, G, S they have.\n\nSo, let me define:\n\n- Exactly 2 items: C plus one of D, G, S. So, number of such residents is 437.\n\n- Exactly 3 items: C plus two of D, G, S. Number is 234.\n\n- Exactly 4 items: C plus all three of D, G, S. Number is x, which we need to find.\n\nWait, but the problem also gives the total number of residents owning each item:\n\n- D: 195\n\n- G: 367\n\n- S: 562\n\nSo, each of these counts includes people who own D alone, D plus another item, or all three.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, but considering the counts for each item and the overlaps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to model this using the formula for the sum of the sizes of the individual sets, minus the sum of the sizes of the pairwise intersections, plus the size of the triple intersection, etc.\n\nWait, let me think in terms of the variables:\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- a = number of people with exactly C and D (and nothing else).\n\n- b = number with exactly C and G.\n\n- c = number with exactly C and S.\n\n- d = number with exactly C, D, G.\n\n- e = number with exactly C, D, S.\n\n- f = number with exactly C, G, S.\n\n- g = number with all four, C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, these are the possible categories.\n\nNow, the number of people owning exactly two items (including C) would be a + b + c.\n\nThe number owning exactly three items would be d + e + f.\n\nThe number owning exactly four would be g.\n\nWait, but the problem states that exactly two items are owned by 437 people, so a + b + c = 437.\n\nExactly three items: 234, so d + e + f = 234.\n\nExactly four: g, which is what we need to find.\n\nNow, the total number of people is 900. So, the sum of all these categories plus those who own none of D, G, S (but since everyone has C, the ones who own none would be 0? Wait, no, because C is always present, but they could own only C and none of D, G, S. But the problem doesn't mention how many own only C. Hmm, but the problem doesn't give any data on that, so maybe all residents own at least one of D, G, S, meaning that the number of people owning only C is zero. Wait, but that might not be the case. The problem doesn't state that. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed without that assumption.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem assumes that all residents own at least one of D, G, S, so that everyone has at least one of those. But the problem doesn't explicitly state that. Hmm, maybe I should proceed without that assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of residents is the sum of those owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, exactly four, plus those who own none. But since the problem doesn't give the number for exactly one, I can't proceed that way.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the counts for each item as the sum of the people in each category that includes that item.\n\nFor example, the number of people owning D is 195, which would be a (C and D) + d (C, D, G) + e (C, D, S) + g (all four).\n\nSimilarly, G is owned by 367, which is b (C and G) + d (C, D, G) + f (C, G, S) + g.\n\nAnd S is owned by 562, which is c (C and S) + e (C, D, S) + f (C, G, S) + g.\n\nSo, let's write these as equations:\n\n1. D: a + d + e + g = 195\n\n2. G: b + d + f + g = 367\n\n3. S: c + e + f + g = 562\n\nWe also know:\n\n4. a + b + c = 437 (exactly two items: C and one other)\n\n5. d + e + f = 234 (exactly three items: C and two others)\n\n6. g = ? (exactly four items)\n\nAnd the total number of residents is 900, which would be the sum of all categories:\n\na + b + c + d + e + f + g + (number owning only C) = 900.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify how many own only C, I'm not sure if we can proceed with this. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem assumes that everyone owns at least one of D, G, S, so the number owning only C is zero. Let's assume that for now. Then, the total would be a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900.\n\nSo, equation 7: a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900.\n\nNow, from equation 4: a + b + c = 437.\n\nFrom equation 5: d + e + f = 234.\n\nSo, substituting into equation 7: 437 + 234 + g = 900.\n\nSo, 671 + g = 900 \u2192 g = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nWait, that's a possible approach. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that this is correct. Because if I sum all these, I get 437 (exactly two) + 234 (exactly three) + g (exactly four) = 437 + 234 + g = 671 + g. The total is 900, so g = 229.\n\nBut let me check if that's correct by plugging into the other equations.\n\nSo, if g = 229, then let's see if equations 1, 2, 3 hold.\n\nFrom equation 1: a + d + e + g = 195.\n\nFrom equation 5: d + e + f = 234.\n\nSo, equation 1 can be rewritten as a + (d + e) + g = 195.\n\nBut d + e = 234 - f.\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes a + (234 - f) + g = 195.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: b + d + f + g = 367.\n\nFrom equation 5, d + e + f =234, so d + f =234 - e.\n\nEquation 2: b + (d + f) + g = 367 \u2192 b + (234 - e) + g = 367.\n\nHmm, this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can express a, b, c in terms of other variables.\n\nWait, from equation 4: a + b + c =437.\n\nFrom equation 5: d + e + f=234.\n\nSo, total from 4 and 5 is 437 + 234 = 671. So, the rest would be g, as equation 7 says 671 + g =900 \u2192 g=229.\n\nBut let's check if this holds with the item counts.\n\nFrom equation 1: a + d + e + g =195.\n\nBut a =437 - b - c.\n\nSimilarly, d + e =234 - f.\n\nSo, equation 1: (437 - b - c) + (234 - f) + g =195.\n\nBut since g=229, substituting:\n\n437 - b - c + 234 - f + 229 =195.\n\nSo, 437 + 234 +229 = 899 +1? Let me calculate 437+234=671, 671+229=900.\n\nSo, 900 - (b + c + f) =195 \u2192 b + c + f =900 -195=705.\n\nHmm, but I don't know if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should sum all three equations (1,2,3) and see.\n\nEquation 1: a + d + e + g =195.\n\nEquation 2: b + d + f + g =367.\n\nEquation 3: c + e + f + g =562.\n\nAdding these together:\n\n(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) + 3g = 195 +367 +562.\n\nWe know a + b + c=437, d + e + f=234, so:\n\n437 + 234 +3g = 195+367+562.\n\nCompute RHS: 195+367=562, 562+562=1124.\n\nSo, 437+234=671, so 671 +3g=1124.\n\nSo, 3g=1124-671=453 \u2192 g=453/3=151.\n\nWait, that's different from the previous 229. So, this suggests that my initial approach was wrong.\n\nHmm, so where did I go wrong?\n\nIn the initial approach, I assumed that the total number of residents is 437 (exactly two) +234 (exactly three) +g (exactly four). But that's not correct because the 437 and 234 include all combinations, including those with C. So, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets, but considering that all residents have C. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to a standard inclusion-exclusion problem but with C being a universal set. So, the number of people owning D, G, S is given, and we can model the overlaps.\n\nWait, let me try to model it as follows:\n\nThe number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to the sum of those owning each, minus the sum of those owning each pair, plus those owning all three.\n\nBut wait, since everyone owns C, the number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to the total number of people minus those who own only C. But the problem doesn't tell us how many own only C, so perhaps this approach isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that the number of people owning exactly k of D, G, S is given, and we can relate that to the inclusion-exclusion.\n\nWait, let me try to model the number of people owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three of D, G, S.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- n1 = number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S.\n\n- n2 = exactly two: 437.\n\n- n3 = exactly three:234.\n\n- n4 = exactly four: x (all four).\n\nBut wait, since all have C, the number of people owning exactly k of D, G, S is the same as owning k+1 items in total.\n\nSo, the total number of people is n0 (only C) + n1 + n2 + n3 + n4.\n\nBut the problem doesn't give n0, so perhaps we can proceed without it.\n\nWait, but the problem gives the total number of people as 900. So, 900 = n0 + n1 + n2 + n3 + n4.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't mention n0, perhaps we can assume that n0=0, meaning everyone owns at least one of D, G, S. So, 900 = n1 + n2 + n3 + n4.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed without knowing n0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the sum of the sizes of D, G, S in terms of n1, n2, n3, n4.\n\nLet me think: the number of people owning D is 195. This includes those who own only D, those who own D and another item, and those who own all three.\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nSo, for D: n1_D + 2*n2_D + 3*n3_D = 195.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to express the counts for each set.\n\nWait, the number of people owning D is equal to the number of people owning exactly D and nothing else (n1_D) plus those owning D and exactly one other (n2_D) plus those owning D and exactly two others (n3_D) plus those owning all four (n4). Wait, no, because n4 would be those owning all three (D, G, S) plus C. So, perhaps the count for D is n1_D + n2_D + n3_D + n4.\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me denote the number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S as n1. So, n1 = a + b + c, where a is exactly D, b exactly G, c exactly S.\n\nWait, but in the problem, 437 own exactly two things, which would be exactly two of D, G, S plus C. So, n2 = 437.\n\nSimilarly, n3 = 234, which is exactly three of D, G, S plus C.\n\nn4 = x, exactly four.\n\nSo, the total number of people is:\n\nn0 + n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 = 900.\n\nBut without knowing n0, perhaps we can't proceed. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes n0=0.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets D, G, S, considering that C is always present.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nBut since everyone owns C, |D \u222a G \u222a S| would be the number of people owning at least one of D, G, S, which I'll denote as T. So, T = |D \u222a G \u222a S|.\n\nBut the total number of people is 900, which equals the number of people owning only C (n0) plus those owning at least one of D, G, S. So, 900 = n0 + T.\n\nBut since I don't know n0, perhaps this approach is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the total number of people as the sum of those owning exactly 1, 2, 3, 4 items.\n\nWait, let me think in terms of the variables:\n\nLet me denote:\n- Only C: n0\n- Exactly C and D: a\n- Exactly C and G: b\n- Exactly C and S: c\n- Exactly C, D, G: d\n- Exactly C, D, S: e\n- Exactly C, G, S: f\n- All four: g\n\nSo, the total number of people is n0 + a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900.\n\nNow, the number of people owning exactly two items (including C) is a + b + c =437.\n\nThe number owning exactly three items (including C) is d + e + f =234.\n\nThe number owning exactly four is g.\n\nThe number owning exactly one item (only C) is n0.\n\nBut we don't know n0.\n\nNow, the counts for each item are:\n\nD: a + d + e + g =195.\n\nG: b + d + f + g =367.\n\nS: c + e + f + g =562.\n\nSo, we have these three equations:\n\n1. a + d + e + g =195\n\n2. b + d + f + g =367\n\n3. c + e + f + g =562\n\nAnd we have:\n\n4. a + b + c =437 (exactly two items)\n\n5. d + e + f =234 (exactly three items)\n\n6. n0 + a + b + c + d + e + f + g =900.\n\nFrom equation 4 and 5, substituting into equation 6:\n\nn0 + 437 + 234 + g =900 \u2192 n0 + 671 + g =900 \u2192 n0 + g =229.\n\nBut we have three equations (1,2,3) and variables a, b, c, d, e, f, g, n0. So, perhaps I can find another equation to relate these variables.\n\nLet me sum equations 1,2,3:\n\n(a + d + e + g) + (b + d + f + g) + (c + e + f + g) =195 +367 +562 = 1124.\n\nThis gives:\n\na + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3g =1124.\n\nFrom equation 4, a + b + c=437.\n\nFrom equation 5, d + e + f=234 \u2192 2d +2e +2f=468.\n\nSo, substituting into the summed equation:\n\n437 + 468 +3g =1124 \u2192 905 +3g=1124 \u21923g=219 \u2192g=73.\n\nWait, that's a different result than before. Hmm.\n\nWait, so this suggests that g=73.\n\nBut earlier, when I assumed that n0=0, I got g=229, but that led to a conflict when checking the equations.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is this one, leading to g=73.\n\nWait, but let's check if that's correct.\n\nSo, g=73.\n\nFrom equation 6: n0 +671 +73=900 \u2192n0=900-744=156.\n\nSo, n0=156. That's the number of people who own only C.\n\nNow, let's check if this holds with the other equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: a + d + e +73=195 \u2192a +d +e=122.\n\nFrom equation 5: d + e + f=234 \u2192 d + e =234 -f.\n\nSubstituting into equation 1: a + (234 -f) =122 \u2192a=122 -234 +f= -112 +f.\n\nHmm, but a can't be negative, so this suggests that f must be at least 112 for a to be non-negative.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: b + d + f +73=367 \u2192b +d +f=294.\n\nFrom equation 5: d + e + f=234.\n\nSo, subtracting equation 5 from equation 2:\n\n(b +d +f) - (d +e +f) =294 -234 \u2192b -e=60 \u2192b=e+60.\n\nFrom equation 3: c + e + f +73=562 \u2192c + e +f=489.\n\nFrom equation 5: d + e + f=234.\n\nSo, equation 3 minus equation 5: c + e +f - (d +e +f) =489 -234 \u2192c -d=255 \u2192c=d +255.\n\nNow, from equation 4: a + b + c=437.\n\nWe have a= -112 +f, b=e+60, c=d+255.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n(-112 +f) + (e +60) + (d +255) =437.\n\nSimplify: (-112 +60 +255) +f + e +d =437 \u2192 (203) + (f + e +d) =437 \u2192 f + e +d=234.\n\nBut from equation 5: d + e + f=234, which matches. So, that's consistent.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find more variables.\n\nWe have:\n\nFrom equation 5: d + e + f=234.\n\nFrom equation 2: b +d +f=294.\n\nBut since b=e+60, equation 2 becomes (e +60) +d +f=294 \u2192 e +d +f +60=294 \u2192 (d +e +f)=234 \u2192 234 +60=294, which holds.\n\nSimilarly, equation 3: c +e +f=489. But c=d +255, so:\n\nd +255 +e +f=489 \u2192 (d +e +f) +255=489 \u2192234 +255=489, which holds.\n\nSo, all equations are consistent, but we still don't know the exact values of a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\nBut we don't need them for the problem. The problem only asks for g, which we found to be 73.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 229, but that was under an incorrect assumption. Now, using the correct inclusion-exclusion approach, I get g=73.\n\nWait, but let me check the initial approach again. I think I made a mistake there by not considering that the counts for D, G, S include overlaps beyond just the two-item and three-item owners.\n\nSo, the correct approach seems to be using the inclusion-exclusion of the three sets D, G, S, and finding that the number of people owning all three (and thus all four including C) is 73.\n\nSo, the answer should be 73.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down. There are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. Then, some own a diamond ring, some a set of golf clubs, some a garden spade, and all have the candy hearts. \n\nThe numbers given are:\n- 195 own a diamond ring.\n- 367 own golf clubs.\n- 562 own a garden spade.\n- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's 900.\n\nThen, it says there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three. I need to find how many own all four.\n\nHmm, okay. So, this sounds like a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall how that works.\n\nInclusion-exclusion is a way to calculate the size of the union of multiple sets by adding up the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on.\n\nBut wait, in this case, we're given the numbers of people who own exactly two or exactly three items. So, maybe I can use that information to find the number who own all four.\n\nLet me denote the sets as follows:\n- Let D be the set of people who own a diamond ring.\n- Let G be those who own golf clubs.\n- Let S be those with a garden spade.\n- Let C be those with candy hearts. But since everyone has candy hearts, C is the universal set here. So, the total number of residents is |C| = 900.\n\nWait, but since C is universal, the number of people who don't own any of the other three items is zero. Because everyone has at least candy hearts. So, that might simplify things.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because in this case, everyone has candy hearts, but the other three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) are optional. So, the total number of people is 900, and each has at least the candy hearts.\n\nSo, when they talk about owning exactly two things, that would include candy hearts and one of the other items. Similarly, exactly three would include candy hearts and two of the other items. And exactly four would include all four.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. If someone owns exactly two things, since everyone has candy hearts, then they must have candy hearts plus exactly one other item. Similarly, exactly three things would be candy hearts plus two other items, and exactly four is all four.\n\nSo, the counts given are:\n- Exactly two: 437. So, these are people who have candy hearts and exactly one other item.\n- Exactly three: 234. These have candy hearts and exactly two other items.\n- Exactly four: what we're trying to find. These have all four.\n\nSo, to model this, let me denote:\n- a = number of people with only D and C.\n- b = number with only G and C.\n- c = number with only S and C.\n- d = number with D and G and C.\n- e = number with D and S and C.\n- f = number with G and S and C.\n- g = number with D, G, S, and C. That's the number we need to find.\n\nWait, but I might be complicating it. Alternatively, since each person must have at least C, we can model the problem by considering the other three items as optional, and C is always present.\n\nSo, the problem is about the number of people owning subsets of {D, G, S}, with C always included.\n\nSo, the total number of people is the sum of those owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, or all four of D, G, S, and C.\n\nBut in the problem, it's stated that 437 own exactly two things. Since C is always owned, exactly two things would mean owning one of the other three plus C. So, these are people with exactly one other item.\n\nSimilarly, 234 own exactly three things, which would mean owning two of the other three plus C.\n\nAnd the number of people who own all four is what we need to find. Let's denote this as x.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to model this using the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nLet me think about the total number of people.\n\nThe total number is 900.\n\nThe number of people owning each item:\n- D: 195\n- G: 367\n- S: 562\n- C: 900 (but since C is universal, it's redundant)\n\nWait, but when applying inclusion-exclusion, we can consider the counts for D, G, S, and then account for overlaps.\n\nWait, but in inclusion-exclusion, the formula for three sets is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nBut since everyone owns C, and we're considering D, G, S as the other items, perhaps it's better to model the number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S. Because all 900 own C, but some may not own any of D, G, S. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention how many own none of D, G, S. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, but some may own none of the other three. Wait, but the problem doesn't state that. So, maybe it's possible that some residents don't own any of D, G, or S. But the problem doesn't give the number for that. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all 900 residents own at least one of D, G, or S, because the problem talks about people owning exactly two or three of the things, but it doesn't say anything about people owning none. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can proceed without knowing the number of people who own none. Let me try to think.\n\nWait, let me try to model this using the inclusion-exclusion for three sets, but considering that the total number of people is 900. Since all own C, but the other items are D, G, S.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking about the union of D, G, S, and C, but since C is universal, the union is just 900. So, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the problem in terms of the counts of people owning exactly 1, 2, 3, or 4 items. Since C is always present, the number of people owning exactly k of D, G, S is equal to the number of people owning exactly k+1 items in total (since C is always there).\n\nWait, so if someone owns exactly one of D, G, S, that would mean they have C plus one, so exactly two items in total. Similarly, owning exactly two of D, G, S would mean they have C plus two, so exactly three items in total. And owning all three (D, G, S) would mean they have C plus three, so four items in total.\n\nWait, but the problem says 437 own exactly two of the things. So, if exactly two refers to exactly two of the four things (C, D, G, S), then that would include C and one other. Because if someone has exactly two, they must have C and one more.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says, \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, the four things are C, D, G, S. So, when it says 437 own exactly two, that could mean any two of the four. But since C is always present, perhaps that's not the case. Wait, no. If a resident has exactly two of the four, that could be any two, including C and another. So, perhaps the counts include C.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.\n\nLet me denote the four items as A, B, C, D, but wait, in the problem, the four are C (candy hearts), D (diamond ring), G (golf clubs), S (garden spade). So, each resident has at least C, but may have 0, 1, 2, or 3 of the other items.\n\nWait, but the problem says 437 own exactly two of these things. So, that could be two including C. So, for example, C and D, or C and G, etc. Similarly, 234 own exactly three, which would be C plus two others, and some own all four (C, D, G, S), which is what we're looking for.\n\nSo, the problem is about the number of residents who own exactly 2, 3, or 4 items, where the items are C, D, G, S. But since C is always owned, the counts of exactly two, exactly three, exactly four are based on how many of D, G, S they have.\n\nSo, let me define:\n\n- Exactly 2 items: C plus one of D, G, S. So, number of such residents is 437.\n\n- Exactly 3 items: C plus two of D, G, S. Number is 234.\n\n- Exactly 4 items: C plus all three of D, G, S. Number is x, which we need to find.\n\nWait, but the problem also gives the total number of residents owning each item:\n\n- D: 195\n\n- G: 367\n\n- S: 562\n\nSo, each of these counts includes people who own D alone, D plus another item, or all three.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, but considering the counts for each item and the overlaps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to model this using the formula for the sum of the sizes of the individual sets, minus the sum of the sizes of the pairwise intersections, plus the size of the triple intersection, etc.\n\nWait, let me think in terms of the variables:\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- a = number of people with exactly C and D (and nothing else).\n\n- b = number with exactly C and G.\n\n- c = number with exactly C and S.\n\n- d = number with exactly C, D, G.\n\n- e = number with exactly C, D, S.\n\n- f = number with exactly C, G, S.\n\n- g = number with all four, C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, these are the possible categories.\n\nNow, the number of people owning exactly two items (including C) would be a + b + c.\n\nThe number owning exactly three items would be d + e + f.\n\nThe number owning exactly four would be g.\n\nWait, but the problem states that exactly two items are owned by 437 people, so a + b + c = 437.\n\nExactly three items: 234, so d + e + f = 234.\n\nExactly four: g, which is what we need to find.\n\nNow, the total number of people is 900. So, the sum of all these categories plus those who own none of D, G, S (but since everyone has C, the ones who own none would be 0? Wait, no, because C is always present, but they could own only C and none of D, G, S. But the problem doesn't mention how many own only C. Hmm, but the problem doesn't give any data on that, so maybe all residents own at least one of D, G, S, meaning that the number of people owning only C is zero. Wait, but that might not be the case. The problem doesn't state that. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed without that assumption.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem assumes that all residents own at least one of D, G, S, so that everyone has at least one of those. But the problem doesn't explicitly state that. Hmm, maybe I should proceed without that assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of residents is the sum of those owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, exactly four, plus those who own none. But since the problem doesn't give the number for exactly one, I can't proceed that way.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the counts for each item as the sum of the people in each category that includes that item.\n\nFor example, the number of people owning D is 195, which would be a (C and D) + d (C, D, G) + e (C, D, S) + g (all four).\n\nSimilarly, G is owned by 367, which is b (C and G) + d (C, D, G) + f (C, G, S) + g.\n\nAnd S is owned by 562, which is c (C and S) + e (C, D, S) + f (C, G, S) + g.\n\nSo, let's write these as equations:\n\n1. D: a + d + e + g = 195\n\n2. G: b + d + f + g = 367\n\n3. S: c + e + f + g = 562\n\nWe also know:\n\n4. a + b + c = 437 (exactly two items: C and one other)\n\n5. d + e + f = 234 (exactly three items: C and two others)\n\n6. g = ? (exactly four items)\n\nAnd the total number of residents is 900, which would be the sum of all categories:\n\na + b + c + d + e + f + g + (number owning only C) = 900.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify how many own only C, I'm not sure if we can proceed with this. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem assumes that everyone owns at least one of D, G, S, so the number owning only C is zero. Let's assume that for now. Then, the total would be a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900.\n\nSo, equation 7: a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900.\n\nNow, from equation 4: a + b + c = 437.\n\nFrom equation 5: d + e + f = 234.\n\nSo, substituting into equation 7: 437 + 234 + g = 900.\n\nSo, 671 + g = 900 \u2192 g = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nWait, that's a possible approach. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that this is correct. Because if I sum all these, I get 437 (exactly two) + 234 (exactly three) + g (exactly four) = 437 + 234 + g = 671 + g. The total is 900, so g = 229.\n\nBut let me check if that's correct by plugging into the other equations.\n\nSo, if g = 229, then let's see if equations 1, 2, 3 hold.\n\nFrom equation 1: a + d + e + g = 195.\n\nFrom equation 5: d + e + f = 234.\n\nSo, equation 1 can be rewritten as a + (d + e) + g = 195.\n\nBut d + e = 234 - f.\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes a + (234 - f) + g = 195.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: b + d + f + g = 367.\n\nFrom equation 5, d + e + f =234, so d + f =234 - e.\n\nEquation 2: b + (d + f) + g = 367 \u2192 b + (234 - e) + g = 367.\n\nHmm, this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can express a, b, c in terms of other variables.\n\nWait, from equation 4: a + b + c =437.\n\nFrom equation 5: d + e + f=234.\n\nSo, total from 4 and 5 is 437 + 234 = 671. So, the rest would be g, as equation 7 says 671 + g =900 \u2192 g=229.\n\nBut let's check if this holds with the item counts.\n\nFrom equation 1: a + d + e + g =195.\n\nBut a =437 - b - c.\n\nSimilarly, d + e =234 - f.\n\nSo, equation 1: (437 - b - c) + (234 - f) + g =195.\n\nBut since g=229, substituting:\n\n437 - b - c + 234 - f + 229 =195.\n\nSo, 437 + 234 +229 = 899 +1? Let me calculate 437+234=671, 671+229=900.\n\nSo, 900 - (b + c + f) =195 \u2192 b + c + f =900 -195=705.\n\nHmm, but I don't know if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should sum all three equations (1,2,3) and see.\n\nEquation 1: a + d + e + g =195.\n\nEquation 2: b + d + f + g =367.\n\nEquation 3: c + e + f + g =562.\n\nAdding these together:\n\n(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) + 3g = 195 +367 +562.\n\nWe know a + b + c=437, d + e + f=234, so:\n\n437 + 234 +3g = 195+367+562.\n\nCompute RHS: 195+367=562, 562+562=1124.\n\nSo, 437+234=671, so 671 +3g=1124.\n\nSo, 3g=1124-671=453 \u2192 g=453/3=151.\n\nWait, that's different from the previous 229. So, this suggests that my initial approach was wrong.\n\nHmm, so where did I go wrong?\n\nIn the initial approach, I assumed that the total number of residents is 437 (exactly two) +234 (exactly three) +g (exactly four). But that's not correct because the 437 and 234 include all combinations, including those with C. So, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets, but considering that all residents have C. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to a standard inclusion-exclusion problem but with C being a universal set. So, the number of people owning D, G, S is given, and we can model the overlaps.\n\nWait, let me try to model it as follows:\n\nThe number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to the sum of those owning each, minus the sum of those owning each pair, plus those owning all three.\n\nBut wait, since everyone owns C, the number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to the total number of people minus those who own only C. But the problem doesn't tell us how many own only C, so perhaps this approach isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that the number of people owning exactly k of D, G, S is given, and we can relate that to the inclusion-exclusion.\n\nWait, let me try to model the number of people owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three of D, G, S.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- n1 = number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S.\n\n- n2 = exactly two: 437.\n\n- n3 = exactly three:234.\n\n- n4 = exactly four: x (all four).\n\nBut wait, since all have C, the number of people owning exactly k of D, G, S is the same as owning k+1 items in total.\n\nSo, the total number of people is n0 (only C) + n1 + n2 + n3 + n4.\n\nBut the problem doesn't give n0, so perhaps we can proceed without it.\n\nWait, but the problem gives the total number of people as 900. So, 900 = n0 + n1 + n2 + n3 + n4.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't mention n0, perhaps we can assume that n0=0, meaning everyone owns at least one of D, G, S. So, 900 = n1 + n2 + n3 + n4.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed without knowing n0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the sum of the sizes of D, G, S in terms of n1, n2, n3, n4.\n\nLet me think: the number of people owning D is 195. This includes those who own only D, those who own D and another item, and those who own all three.\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nSo, for D: n1_D + 2*n2_D + 3*n3_D = 195.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to express the counts for each set.\n\nWait, the number of people owning D is equal to the number of people owning exactly D and nothing else (n1_D) plus those owning D and exactly one other (n2_D) plus those owning D and exactly two others (n3_D) plus those owning all four (n4). Wait, no, because n4 would be those owning all three (D, G, S) plus C. So, perhaps the count for D is n1_D + n2_D + n3_D + n4.\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me denote the number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S as n1. So, n1 = a + b + c, where a is exactly D, b exactly G, c exactly S.\n\nWait, but in the problem, 437 own exactly two things, which would be exactly two of D, G, S plus C. So, n2 = 437.\n\nSimilarly, n3 = 234, which is exactly three of D, G, S plus C.\n\nn4 = x, exactly four.\n\nSo, the total number of people is:\n\nn0 + n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 = 900.\n\nBut without knowing n0, perhaps we can't proceed. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes n0=0.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets D, G, S, considering that C is always present.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nBut since everyone owns C, |D \u222a G \u222a S| would be the number of people owning at least one of D, G, S, which I'll denote as T. So, T = |D \u222a G \u222a S|.\n\nBut the total number of people is 900, which equals the number of people owning only C (n0) plus those owning at least one of D, G, S. So, 900 = n0 + T.\n\nBut since I don't know n0, perhaps this approach is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the total number of people as the sum of those owning exactly 1, 2, 3, 4 items.\n\nWait, let me think in terms of the variables:\n\nLet me denote:\n- Only C: n0\n- Exactly C and D: a\n- Exactly C and G: b\n- Exactly C and S: c\n- Exactly C, D, G: d\n- Exactly C, D, S: e\n- Exactly C, G, S: f\n- All four: g\n\nSo, the total number of people is n0 + a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900.\n\nNow, the number of people owning exactly two items (including C) is a + b + c =437.\n\nThe number owning exactly three items (including C) is d + e + f =234.\n\nThe number owning exactly four is g.\n\nThe number owning exactly one item (only C) is n0.\n\nBut we don't know n0.\n\nNow, the counts for each item are:\n\nD: a + d + e + g =195.\n\nG: b + d + f + g =367.\n\nS: c + e + f + g =562.\n\nSo, we have these three equations:\n\n1. a + d + e + g =195\n\n2. b + d + f + g =367\n\n3. c + e + f + g =562\n\nAnd we have:\n\n4. a + b + c =437 (exactly two items)\n\n5. d + e + f =234 (exactly three items)\n\n6. n0 + a + b + c + d + e + f + g =900.\n\nFrom equation 4 and 5, substituting into equation 6:\n\nn0 + 437 + 234 + g =900 \u2192 n0 + 671 + g =900 \u2192 n0 + g =229.\n\nBut we have three equations (1,2,3) and variables a, b, c, d, e, f, g, n0. So, perhaps I can find another equation to relate these variables.\n\nLet me sum equations 1,2,3:\n\n(a + d + e + g) + (b + d + f + g) + (c + e + f + g) =195 +367 +562 = 1124.\n\nThis gives:\n\na + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3g =1124.\n\nFrom equation 4, a + b + c=437.\n\nFrom equation 5, d + e + f=234 \u2192 2d +2e +2f=468.\n\nSo, substituting into the summed equation:\n\n437 + 468 +3g =1124 \u2192 905 +3g=1124 \u21923g=219 \u2192g=73.\n\nWait, that's a different result than before. Hmm.\n\nWait, so this suggests that g=73.\n\nBut earlier, when I assumed that n0=0, I got g=229, but that led to a conflict when checking the equations.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is this one, leading to g=73.\n\nWait, but let's check if that's correct.\n\nSo, g=73.\n\nFrom equation 6: n0 +671 +73=900 \u2192n0=900-744=156.\n\nSo, n0=156. That's the number of people who own only C.\n\nNow, let's check if this holds with the other equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: a + d + e +73=195 \u2192a +d +e=122.\n\nFrom equation 5: d + e + f=234 \u2192 d + e =234 -f.\n\nSubstituting into equation 1: a + (234 -f) =122 \u2192a=122 -234 +f= -112 +f.\n\nHmm, but a can't be negative, so this suggests that f must be at least 112 for a to be non-negative.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: b + d + f +73=367 \u2192b +d +f=294.\n\nFrom equation 5: d + e + f=234.\n\nSo, subtracting equation 5 from equation 2:\n\n(b +d +f) - (d +e +f) =294 -234 \u2192b -e=60 \u2192b=e+60.\n\nFrom equation 3: c + e + f +73=562 \u2192c + e +f=489.\n\nFrom equation 5: d + e + f=234.\n\nSo, equation 3 minus equation 5: c + e +f - (d +e +f) =489 -234 \u2192c -d=255 \u2192c=d +255.\n\nNow, from equation 4: a + b + c=437.\n\nWe have a= -112 +f, b=e+60, c=d+255.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n(-112 +f) + (e +60) + (d +255) =437.\n\nSimplify: (-112 +60 +255) +f + e +d =437 \u2192 (203) + (f + e +d) =437 \u2192 f + e +d=234.\n\nBut from equation 5: d + e + f=234, which matches. So, that's consistent.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find more variables.\n\nWe have:\n\nFrom equation 5: d + e + f=234.\n\nFrom equation 2: b +d +f=294.\n\nBut since b=e+60, equation 2 becomes (e +60) +d +f=294 \u2192 e +d +f +60=294 \u2192 (d +e +f)=234 \u2192 234 +60=294, which holds.\n\nSimilarly, equation 3: c +e +f=489. But c=d +255, so:\n\nd +255 +e +f=489 \u2192 (d +e +f) +255=489 \u2192234 +255=489, which holds.\n\nSo, all equations are consistent, but we still don't know the exact values of a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\nBut we don't need them for the problem. The problem only asks for g, which we found to be 73.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 229, but that was under an incorrect assumption. Now, using the correct inclusion-exclusion approach, I get g=73.\n\nWait, but let me check the initial approach again. I think I made a mistake there by not considering that the counts for D, G, S include overlaps beyond just the two-item and three-item owners.\n\nSo, the correct approach seems to be using the inclusion-exclusion of the three sets D, G, S, and finding that the number of people owning all three (and thus all four including C) is 73.\n\nSo, the answer should be 73.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the given data systematically.\n\n### Given Data:\n- Total residents: 900\n- Residents owning a diamond ring (D): 195\n- Residents owning golf clubs (G): 367\n- Residents owning a garden spade (S): 562\n- Residents owning exactly two items: 437\n- Residents owning exactly three items: 234\n- All residents own a bag of candy hearts (C), which is universal.\n\n### Approach:\nWe categorize residents based on the number of items they own:\n1. **Exactly two items (including C)**: 437 residents.\n2. **Exactly three items (including C)**: 234 residents.\n3. **All four items (including C)**: \\( g \\) residents (to find).\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets \\( D, G, S \\), we set up the following equations:\n\n1. \\( a + d + e + g = 195 \\) (for D)\n2. \\( b + d + f + g = 367 \\) (for G)\n3. \\( c + e + f + g = 562 \\) (for S)\n\nWhere:\n- \\( a, b, c \\): Residents owning exactly two items (C and one other).\n- \\( d, e, f \\): Residents owning exactly three items (C and two others).\n- \\( g \\): Residents owning all four items (C, D, G, S).\n\n### Key Equations:\n- \\( a + b + c = 437 \\) (exactly two items)\n- \\( d + e + f = 234 \\) (exactly three items)\n- Total residents: \\( a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900 \\)\n\n### Solving for \\( g \\):\nSumming the three item equations:\n\\[\n(a + d + e + g) + (b + d + f + g) + (c + e + f + g) = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\na + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3g = 1124\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( a + b + c = 437 \\) and \\( d + e + f = 234 \\):\n\\[\n437 + 2(234) + 3g = 1124\n\\]\n\\[\n437 + 468 + 3g = 1124\n\\]\n\\[\n905 + 3g = 1124\n\\]\n\\[\n3g = 219 \\implies g = 73\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe number of residents who own all four items is **73**.\n\n\\boxed{73}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, it's about sets and their overlaps, so I think I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. \n\nAlright, let me list out the given numbers:\n\n- Total residents: 900\n- Number of diamond ring owners: 195\n- Number of golf club owners: 367\n- Number of garden spade owners: 562\n- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's 900.\n\nWait, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that means the set for candy hearts has 900 members. That's the universal set here. So, all residents own at least a candy heart. Interesting.\n\nNow, the problem also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. I need to find how many own all four.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Each resident owns a candy heart, and then some may own other things. So, the four things are: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. But since everyone owns candy hearts, it's more about how the other three items overlap with each other and with candy hearts.\n\nWait, no, actually, the four items are: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Because the problem says, \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, each resident has at least a candy heart. So, the four items are: D (diamond ring), G (golf clubs), S (spade), and C (candy hearts). But since C is universal, everyone has it, so when considering overlaps, C is kind of the base.\n\nBut the problem says 437 own exactly two of these things. So, exactly two among D, G, S, C. But since everyone has C, any person who owns exactly two would have C plus one other. Wait, no, maybe not. Because, for example, if someone owns exactly two, it could be two of D, G, S, but not necessarily involving C. Wait, no, because they all have C. So, if someone owns exactly two, it must include C, right? Because they have C plus one more. Because otherwise, if they don't have C, that's impossible because everyone has C.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me think. If a resident owns exactly two of the four things, but since they all have C, then having exactly two would mean they have C plus exactly one other item. Because if you have two, it's C and one more, because you can't have two without C because you have to have C.\n\nWait, no, that's not necessarily true. Because the problem says \"exactly two of these things,\" but since C is always there, maybe it's not counted as one of the two? Or is it? Wait, no, the problem says \"exactly two of these things,\" meaning exactly two among the four. So, that includes C as one of the possibilities.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Let me clarify: the four things are D, G, S, C. Each resident has at least C. So, when they say \"exactly two of these things,\" that includes C as one of the two. So, a resident could have C and D, but not G or S; or C and G, but not D or S; etc. So, exactly two means that they have C plus exactly one other item.\n\nSimilarly, exactly three would mean they have C plus two other items.\n\nAnd exactly four would mean they have all four.\n\nWait, but the problem says 437 residents own exactly two of these things. So, exactly two among D, G, S, C. So, each of these 437 residents has exactly two of the four, which includes C. So, each of them has C plus one more. So, they have two things: C and one other.\n\nSimilarly, 234 residents own exactly three of the four, which would be C plus two others.\n\nAnd the ones who own all four would be the ones who have C, D, G, S.\n\nWait, so let me rephrase the problem in terms of sets.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let U be the universal set, which is 900 residents.\n\n- Let D be the set of diamond ring owners: |D|=195\n\n- Let G be the set of golf club owners: |G|=367\n\n- Let S be the set of spade owners: |S|=562\n\n- Let C be the set of candy heart owners: |C|=900\n\nWe are told that each resident owns a candy heart, so C is the universal set.\n\nWe are also told:\n\n- 437 residents own exactly two of these things.\n\n- 234 residents own exactly three of these things.\n\nWe need to find the number of residents who own all four, which is |D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C|.\n\nWait, but since C is universal, the intersection D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C is the same as D \u2229 G \u2229 S. So, the number of people who own all four is the same as the number who own all three of D, G, S.\n\nSo, maybe we can model this as a standard inclusion-exclusion problem for three sets, but with the fourth set being universal.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as four sets with C being universal, but since everyone is in C, perhaps we can think of it as three sets (D, G, S) within the universal set C.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to three sets within a universal set of size 900.\n\nThe counts are:\n\n- |D| =195\n\n- |G|=367\n\n- |S|=562\n\nAnd the counts for exactly two and exactly three are given.\n\nWait, but in the standard inclusion-exclusion for three sets, the formula is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nBut in this case, since everyone is in C, which is the universal set, and the only other things they can have are D, G, S. So, the total number of people not owning any of D, G, S is zero because everyone has at least C, but can have none of D, G, S. Wait, no, that's not correct because if someone has only C, they don't have any of D, G, S. Wait, but the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, but doesn't say they have to own any of the others. So, someone can own only C.\n\nWait, but the problem says: there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things. But since all have C, if someone owns exactly two, that includes C and one other. So, they have C plus one of D, G, S. Similarly, exactly three would be C plus two of D, G, S. Exactly four would be all three D, G, S plus C.\n\nWait, but in our case, the universal set is 900, and the problem says 437 own exactly two, 234 own exactly three, and we need to find those who own all four.\n\nSo, let me think about how to model this.\n\nEach resident can have 1, 2, 3, or 4 of the things. But since everyone has C, the minimum is 1 (only C), and the maximum is 4 (all four).\n\nWait, but the problem states that 437 own exactly two, 234 own exactly three, and we need to find exactly four. But what about those who own exactly one? They would be the ones who have only C.\n\nSo, let me denote:\n\nLet a = number of residents with exactly one item: only C.\n\nb = number with exactly two: C plus one other.\n\nc = number with exactly three: C plus two others.\n\nd = number with exactly four: all four.\n\nSo, a + b + c + d = 900.\n\nWe know that b = 437, c = 234. We need to find d.\n\nSo, a = 900 - (437 + 234 + d) = 900 - 671 - d = 229 - d.\n\nBut I don't know a yet.\n\nBut let's think about how the inclusion-exclusion principle works here.\n\nThe total number of people owning D is 195, which includes those who own only D, those who own D and another, D and two others, etc.\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nBut since we have counts for exactly two and exactly three, perhaps we can relate this.\n\nWait, for each of the three items D, G, S:\n\n- The number of people owning D is |D| = 195.\n\nThis includes:\n\n- Those who own only D (but since everyone has C, this is impossible because to own only D, you have to have C as well. Wait, no, wait: if someone owns D, they have C, so they have at least two items. So, no one owns only D. Similarly for G and S.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Since everyone has C, no one owns exactly one of D, G, S. Because if someone has D, they must have C, so they have at least two items (D and C). So, the number of people owning exactly two items must include those who have C and exactly one other.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three items includes those who have C and exactly two others.\n\nAnd the number of people owning all four is d, which have all three plus C.\n\nSo, for each item:\n\n|D| = number of people owning D = number of people who have D and exactly one other (so C and D) plus those who have D and two others (C, D, and one more) plus those who have all four.\n\nSimilarly, |G| = 367, which is the number of people who own G and exactly one other (C and G), plus those who have G and two others, plus those with all four.\n\nSame for |S| =562.\n\nSo, let's model this.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet x = number of people who have exactly C and D (only two items: C and D).\n\nSimilarly, y = exactly C and G.\n\nz = exactly C and S.\n\nw = exactly C, D, G.\n\nu = exactly C, D, S.\n\nv = exactly C, G, S.\n\nAnd d = exactly C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, the number of people with exactly two items is x + y + z = 437.\n\nThe number of people with exactly three items is w + u + v = 234.\n\nAnd the number with exactly four is d.\n\nNow, the total number of people is:\n\na (only C) + (x + y + z) (exactly two) + (w + u + v) (exactly three) + d (exactly four) = 900.\n\nSo, a + 437 + 234 + d = 900.\n\nSo, a + d = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, a + d = 229.\n\nNow, let's consider the counts for each item.\n\nFor D:\n\n|D| = x + w + u + d =195.\n\nSimilarly, for G:\n\n|G| = y + w + v + d =367.\n\nFor S:\n\n|S| = z + u + v + d =562.\n\nWe have these three equations.\n\nAnd we have a + d =229.\n\nWe also have x + y + z =437.\n\nw + u + v =234.\n\nSo, let's write down all the equations:\n\n1. x + y + z =437 (exactly two)\n2. w + u + v =234 (exactly three)\n3. a + d =229\n4. x + w + u + d =195 (D)\n5. y + w + v + d =367 (G)\n6. z + u + v + d =562 (S)\n\nWe have six equations and variables: x, y, z, w, u, v, d, a.\n\nBut we have eight variables and six equations, so we need to find another relation.\n\nWait, perhaps we can express a in terms of d: a=229 - d.\n\nNow, let me think about the inclusion-exclusion for three sets D, G, S within the universal set C.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion formula for |D \u222a G \u222a S| is:\n\n|D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nBut since all residents are in C, |D \u222a G \u222a S| is the number of people who have at least one of D, G, S, which is equal to 900 - a, because a is the number who have only C.\n\nSo, |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - a.\n\nBut from equation 3, a = 229 - d. So, |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - (229 - d) = 671 + d.\n\nNow, applying inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nWe have |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562.\n\nSo, 671 + d = 195 + 367 + 562 - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nCalculating 195 + 367 + 562: 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124.\n\nSo, 671 + d = 1124 - (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|) + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nNow, |D\u2229G| is the number of people who have both D and G, which includes those who have exactly D, G, and possibly others.\n\nBut from our earlier definitions:\n\n|D\u2229G| = number of people with D and G, which includes those with exactly D and G (which is w), those with D, G, and S (v), and those with D, G, and C (wait, no, because C is already included. Wait, no, actually, |D\u2229G| includes all people who have both D and G, regardless of other items. So, that would be:\n\n|D\u2229G| = w + u + v + d.\n\nWait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, |D\u2229G| is the number of people who have both D and G. These people can have:\n\n- Only C, D, G: which is w.\n\n- C, D, G, S: which is d.\n\n- C, D, G, S: no, wait, w is exactly C, D, G.\n\nSimilarly, u is C, D, S.\n\nv is C, G, S.\n\nd is all four.\n\nWait, no, |D\u2229G| includes:\n\n- w: exactly C, D, G.\n\n- u: C, D, S: do they have G? No, they have D and S, not G. So, no.\n\n- v: C, G, S: do they have D? No, so they don't.\n\n- d: all four.\n\nSo, |D\u2229G| = w + d.\n\nSimilarly, |D\u2229S| = u + d.\n\nAnd |G\u2229S| = v + d.\n\nWait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, |D\u2229G| is the set of people who have both D and G. So, they can have:\n\n- Exactly D, G, and C: which is w.\n\n- D, G, and S: which is v.\n\nWait, no, wait, no: v is exactly C, G, S. So, they don't have D.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in our variables:\n\n- w is exactly C, D, G.\n\n- u is exactly C, D, S.\n\n- v is exactly C, G, S.\n\n- d is exactly C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, |D\u2229G| includes:\n\n- w: C, D, G.\n\n- d: C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, |D\u2229G| = w + d.\n\nSimilarly, |D\u2229S| = u + d.\n\nAnd |G\u2229S| = v + d.\n\nSo, substituting back into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\n671 + d = 1124 - ( (w + d) + (u + d) + (v + d) ) + d.\n\nSimplify the terms inside the parentheses:\n\n(w + d) + (u + d) + (v + d) = w + u + v + 3d.\n\nFrom equation 2, w + u + v =234.\n\nSo, this becomes 234 + 3d.\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n671 + d = 1124 - (234 + 3d) + d.\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1124 -234 is 890.\n\nSo, 890 -3d +d =890 -2d.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n671 + d = 890 -2d.\n\nNow, let's solve for d:\n\n671 + d + 2d =890.\n\n671 + 3d =890.\n\n3d =890 -671 =219.\n\nSo, d=219/3=73.\n\nSo, d=73.\n\nWait, so the number of residents who own all four things is 73.\n\nLet me verify that this makes sense.\n\nSo, if d=73, then a=229 -73=156.\n\nSo, a=156.\n\nNow, let's see if the counts for D, G, S add up.\n\nFrom equation 4: x + w + u + d =195.\n\nWe know d=73, so x + w + u =195 -73=122.\n\nSimilarly, equation 5: y + w + v + d=367.\n\nSo, y + w + v =367 -73=294.\n\nEquation 6: z + u + v + d=562.\n\nSo, z + u + v=562 -73=489.\n\nNow, from equation 1: x + y + z=437.\n\nEquation 2: w + u + v=234.\n\nSo, let's see if we can find x, y, z, w, u, v.\n\nWe have:\n\nx + y + z=437.\n\nw + u + v=234.\n\nFrom equation 4: x + w + u=122.\n\nFrom equation 5: y + w + v=294.\n\nFrom equation 6: z + u + v=489.\n\nLet me write these as:\n\nEquation 4: x + (w + u) =122.\n\nBut from equation 2, w + u + v=234, so w + u=234 -v.\n\nSo, equation 4 becomes x + (234 -v) =122 \u2192 x=122 -234 +v= -112 +v.\n\nSimilarly, equation 5: y + w + v=294.\n\nEquation 6: z + u + v=489.\n\nEquation 1: x + y + z=437.\n\nWe can express x from equation 4 as x= -112 +v.\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes (-112 +v) + y + z=437 \u2192 y + z=437 +112 -v=549 -v.\n\nFrom equation 6: z=489 -u -v.\n\nFrom equation 2: w + u=234 -v.\n\nFrom equation 4: x= -112 +v.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe we can find another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the variables:\n\nWe have:\n\nFrom equation 4: x=122 -w -u.\n\nFrom equation 5: y=294 -w -v.\n\nFrom equation 6: z=489 -u -v.\n\nSubstitute these into equation 1: x + y + z=437.\n\nSo,\n\n(122 -w -u) + (294 -w -v) + (489 -u -v)=437.\n\nSimplify:\n\n122 +294 +489 -w -u -w -v -u -v =437.\n\nTotal constants: 122+294=416, 416+489=905.\n\nVariables: -2w -2u -2v.\n\nSo,\n\n905 -2(w + u + v) =437.\n\nBut from equation 2, w + u + v=234.\n\nSo,\n\n905 -2*234 =905 -468=437.\n\nWhich equals the right side, so it checks out.\n\nSo, the values are consistent.\n\nTherefore, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the overlaps between the sets of residents owning diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), garden spades (S), and candy hearts (C).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, it's about sets and their overlaps, so I think I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. \n\nAlright, let me list out the given numbers:\n\n- Total residents: 900\n- Number of diamond ring owners: 195\n- Number of golf club owners: 367\n- Number of garden spade owners: 562\n- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's 900.\n\nWait, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that means the set for candy hearts has 900 members. That's the universal set here. So, all residents own at least a candy heart. Interesting.\n\nNow, the problem also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. I need to find how many own all four.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Each resident owns a candy heart, and then some may own other things. So, the four things are: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. But since everyone owns candy hearts, it's more about how the other three items overlap with each other and with candy hearts.\n\nWait, no, actually, the four items are: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Because the problem says, \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, each resident has at least a candy heart. So, the four items are: D (diamond ring), G (golf clubs), S (spade), and C (candy hearts). But since C is universal, everyone has it, so when considering overlaps, C is kind of the base.\n\nBut the problem says 437 own exactly two of these things. So, exactly two among D, G, S, C. But since everyone has C, any person who owns exactly two would have C plus one other. Wait, no, maybe not. Because, for example, if someone owns exactly two, it could be two of D, G, S, but not necessarily involving C. Wait, no, because they all have C. So, if someone owns exactly two, it must include C, right? Because they have C plus one more. Because otherwise, if they don't have C, that's impossible because everyone has C.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me think. If a resident owns exactly two of the four things, but since they all have C, then having exactly two would mean they have C plus exactly one other item. Because if you have two, it's C and one more, because you can't have two without C because you have to have C.\n\nWait, no, that's not necessarily true. Because the problem says \"exactly two of these things,\" but since C is always there, maybe it's not counted as one of the two? Or is it? Wait, no, the problem says \"exactly two of these things,\" meaning exactly two among the four. So, that includes C as one of the possibilities.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Let me clarify: the four things are D, G, S, C. Each resident has at least C. So, when they say \"exactly two of these things,\" that includes C as one of the two. So, a resident could have C and D, but not G or S; or C and G, but not D or S; etc. So, exactly two means that they have C plus exactly one other item.\n\nSimilarly, exactly three would mean they have C plus two other items.\n\nAnd exactly four would mean they have all four.\n\nWait, but the problem says 437 residents own exactly two of these things. So, exactly two among D, G, S, C. So, each of these 437 residents has exactly two of the four, which includes C. So, each of them has C plus one more. So, they have two things: C and one other.\n\nSimilarly, 234 residents own exactly three of the four, which would be C plus two others.\n\nAnd the ones who own all four would be the ones who have C, D, G, S.\n\nWait, so let me rephrase the problem in terms of sets.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let U be the universal set, which is 900 residents.\n\n- Let D be the set of diamond ring owners: |D|=195\n\n- Let G be the set of golf club owners: |G|=367\n\n- Let S be the set of spade owners: |S|=562\n\n- Let C be the set of candy heart owners: |C|=900\n\nWe are told that each resident owns a candy heart, so C is the universal set.\n\nWe are also told:\n\n- 437 residents own exactly two of these things.\n\n- 234 residents own exactly three of these things.\n\nWe need to find the number of residents who own all four, which is |D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C|.\n\nWait, but since C is universal, the intersection D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C is the same as D \u2229 G \u2229 S. So, the number of people who own all four is the same as the number who own all three of D, G, S.\n\nSo, maybe we can model this as a standard inclusion-exclusion problem for three sets, but with the fourth set being universal.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as four sets with C being universal, but since everyone is in C, perhaps we can think of it as three sets (D, G, S) within the universal set C.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to three sets within a universal set of size 900.\n\nThe counts are:\n\n- |D| =195\n\n- |G|=367\n\n- |S|=562\n\nAnd the counts for exactly two and exactly three are given.\n\nWait, but in the standard inclusion-exclusion for three sets, the formula is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nBut in this case, since everyone is in C, which is the universal set, and the only other things they can have are D, G, S. So, the total number of people not owning any of D, G, S is zero because everyone has at least C, but can have none of D, G, S. Wait, no, that's not correct because if someone has only C, they don't have any of D, G, S. Wait, but the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, but doesn't say they have to own any of the others. So, someone can own only C.\n\nWait, but the problem says: there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things. But since all have C, if someone owns exactly two, that includes C and one other. So, they have C plus one of D, G, S. Similarly, exactly three would be C plus two of D, G, S. Exactly four would be all three D, G, S plus C.\n\nWait, but in our case, the universal set is 900, and the problem says 437 own exactly two, 234 own exactly three, and we need to find those who own all four.\n\nSo, let me think about how to model this.\n\nEach resident can have 1, 2, 3, or 4 of the things. But since everyone has C, the minimum is 1 (only C), and the maximum is 4 (all four).\n\nWait, but the problem states that 437 own exactly two, 234 own exactly three, and we need to find exactly four. But what about those who own exactly one? They would be the ones who have only C.\n\nSo, let me denote:\n\nLet a = number of residents with exactly one item: only C.\n\nb = number with exactly two: C plus one other.\n\nc = number with exactly three: C plus two others.\n\nd = number with exactly four: all four.\n\nSo, a + b + c + d = 900.\n\nWe know that b = 437, c = 234. We need to find d.\n\nSo, a = 900 - (437 + 234 + d) = 900 - 671 - d = 229 - d.\n\nBut I don't know a yet.\n\nBut let's think about how the inclusion-exclusion principle works here.\n\nThe total number of people owning D is 195, which includes those who own only D, those who own D and another, D and two others, etc.\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nBut since we have counts for exactly two and exactly three, perhaps we can relate this.\n\nWait, for each of the three items D, G, S:\n\n- The number of people owning D is |D| = 195.\n\nThis includes:\n\n- Those who own only D (but since everyone has C, this is impossible because to own only D, you have to have C as well. Wait, no, wait: if someone owns D, they have C, so they have at least two items. So, no one owns only D. Similarly for G and S.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Since everyone has C, no one owns exactly one of D, G, S. Because if someone has D, they must have C, so they have at least two items (D and C). So, the number of people owning exactly two items must include those who have C and exactly one other.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three items includes those who have C and exactly two others.\n\nAnd the number of people owning all four is d, which have all three plus C.\n\nSo, for each item:\n\n|D| = number of people owning D = number of people who have D and exactly one other (so C and D) plus those who have D and two others (C, D, and one more) plus those who have all four.\n\nSimilarly, |G| = 367, which is the number of people who own G and exactly one other (C and G), plus those who have G and two others, plus those with all four.\n\nSame for |S| =562.\n\nSo, let's model this.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet x = number of people who have exactly C and D (only two items: C and D).\n\nSimilarly, y = exactly C and G.\n\nz = exactly C and S.\n\nw = exactly C, D, G.\n\nu = exactly C, D, S.\n\nv = exactly C, G, S.\n\nAnd d = exactly C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, the number of people with exactly two items is x + y + z = 437.\n\nThe number of people with exactly three items is w + u + v = 234.\n\nAnd the number with exactly four is d.\n\nNow, the total number of people is:\n\na (only C) + (x + y + z) (exactly two) + (w + u + v) (exactly three) + d (exactly four) = 900.\n\nSo, a + 437 + 234 + d = 900.\n\nSo, a + d = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, a + d = 229.\n\nNow, let's consider the counts for each item.\n\nFor D:\n\n|D| = x + w + u + d =195.\n\nSimilarly, for G:\n\n|G| = y + w + v + d =367.\n\nFor S:\n\n|S| = z + u + v + d =562.\n\nWe have these three equations.\n\nAnd we have a + d =229.\n\nWe also have x + y + z =437.\n\nw + u + v =234.\n\nSo, let's write down all the equations:\n\n1. x + y + z =437 (exactly two)\n2. w + u + v =234 (exactly three)\n3. a + d =229\n4. x + w + u + d =195 (D)\n5. y + w + v + d =367 (G)\n6. z + u + v + d =562 (S)\n\nWe have six equations and variables: x, y, z, w, u, v, d, a.\n\nBut we have eight variables and six equations, so we need to find another relation.\n\nWait, perhaps we can express a in terms of d: a=229 - d.\n\nNow, let me think about the inclusion-exclusion for three sets D, G, S within the universal set C.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion formula for |D \u222a G \u222a S| is:\n\n|D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nBut since all residents are in C, |D \u222a G \u222a S| is the number of people who have at least one of D, G, S, which is equal to 900 - a, because a is the number who have only C.\n\nSo, |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - a.\n\nBut from equation 3, a = 229 - d. So, |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - (229 - d) = 671 + d.\n\nNow, applying inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nWe have |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562.\n\nSo, 671 + d = 195 + 367 + 562 - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nCalculating 195 + 367 + 562: 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124.\n\nSo, 671 + d = 1124 - (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|) + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nNow, |D\u2229G| is the number of people who have both D and G, which includes those who have exactly D, G, and possibly others.\n\nBut from our earlier definitions:\n\n|D\u2229G| = number of people with D and G, which includes those with exactly D and G (which is w), those with D, G, and S (v), and those with D, G, and C (wait, no, because C is already included. Wait, no, actually, |D\u2229G| includes all people who have both D and G, regardless of other items. So, that would be:\n\n|D\u2229G| = w + u + v + d.\n\nWait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, |D\u2229G| is the number of people who have both D and G. These people can have:\n\n- Only C, D, G: which is w.\n\n- C, D, G, S: which is d.\n\n- C, D, G, S: no, wait, w is exactly C, D, G.\n\nSimilarly, u is C, D, S.\n\nv is C, G, S.\n\nd is all four.\n\nWait, no, |D\u2229G| includes:\n\n- w: exactly C, D, G.\n\n- u: C, D, S: do they have G? No, they have D and S, not G. So, no.\n\n- v: C, G, S: do they have D? No, so they don't.\n\n- d: all four.\n\nSo, |D\u2229G| = w + d.\n\nSimilarly, |D\u2229S| = u + d.\n\nAnd |G\u2229S| = v + d.\n\nWait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, |D\u2229G| is the set of people who have both D and G. So, they can have:\n\n- Exactly D, G, and C: which is w.\n\n- D, G, and S: which is v.\n\nWait, no, wait, no: v is exactly C, G, S. So, they don't have D.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in our variables:\n\n- w is exactly C, D, G.\n\n- u is exactly C, D, S.\n\n- v is exactly C, G, S.\n\n- d is exactly C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, |D\u2229G| includes:\n\n- w: C, D, G.\n\n- d: C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, |D\u2229G| = w + d.\n\nSimilarly, |D\u2229S| = u + d.\n\nAnd |G\u2229S| = v + d.\n\nSo, substituting back into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\n671 + d = 1124 - ( (w + d) + (u + d) + (v + d) ) + d.\n\nSimplify the terms inside the parentheses:\n\n(w + d) + (u + d) + (v + d) = w + u + v + 3d.\n\nFrom equation 2, w + u + v =234.\n\nSo, this becomes 234 + 3d.\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n671 + d = 1124 - (234 + 3d) + d.\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1124 -234 is 890.\n\nSo, 890 -3d +d =890 -2d.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n671 + d = 890 -2d.\n\nNow, let's solve for d:\n\n671 + d + 2d =890.\n\n671 + 3d =890.\n\n3d =890 -671 =219.\n\nSo, d=219/3=73.\n\nSo, d=73.\n\nWait, so the number of residents who own all four things is 73.\n\nLet me verify that this makes sense.\n\nSo, if d=73, then a=229 -73=156.\n\nSo, a=156.\n\nNow, let's see if the counts for D, G, S add up.\n\nFrom equation 4: x + w + u + d =195.\n\nWe know d=73, so x + w + u =195 -73=122.\n\nSimilarly, equation 5: y + w + v + d=367.\n\nSo, y + w + v =367 -73=294.\n\nEquation 6: z + u + v + d=562.\n\nSo, z + u + v=562 -73=489.\n\nNow, from equation 1: x + y + z=437.\n\nEquation 2: w + u + v=234.\n\nSo, let's see if we can find x, y, z, w, u, v.\n\nWe have:\n\nx + y + z=437.\n\nw + u + v=234.\n\nFrom equation 4: x + w + u=122.\n\nFrom equation 5: y + w + v=294.\n\nFrom equation 6: z + u + v=489.\n\nLet me write these as:\n\nEquation 4: x + (w + u) =122.\n\nBut from equation 2, w + u + v=234, so w + u=234 -v.\n\nSo, equation 4 becomes x + (234 -v) =122 \u2192 x=122 -234 +v= -112 +v.\n\nSimilarly, equation 5: y + w + v=294.\n\nEquation 6: z + u + v=489.\n\nEquation 1: x + y + z=437.\n\nWe can express x from equation 4 as x= -112 +v.\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes (-112 +v) + y + z=437 \u2192 y + z=437 +112 -v=549 -v.\n\nFrom equation 6: z=489 -u -v.\n\nFrom equation 2: w + u=234 -v.\n\nFrom equation 4: x= -112 +v.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe we can find another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the variables:\n\nWe have:\n\nFrom equation 4: x=122 -w -u.\n\nFrom equation 5: y=294 -w -v.\n\nFrom equation 6: z=489 -u -v.\n\nSubstitute these into equation 1: x + y + z=437.\n\nSo,\n\n(122 -w -u) + (294 -w -v) + (489 -u -v)=437.\n\nSimplify:\n\n122 +294 +489 -w -u -w -v -u -v =437.\n\nTotal constants: 122+294=416, 416+489=905.\n\nVariables: -2w -2u -2v.\n\nSo,\n\n905 -2(w + u + v) =437.\n\nBut from equation 2, w + u + v=234.\n\nSo,\n\n905 -2*234 =905 -468=437.\n\nWhich equals the right side, so it checks out.\n\nSo, the values are consistent.\n\nTherefore, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the overlaps between the sets of residents owning diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), garden spades (S), and candy hearts (C). Since everyone owns candy hearts, C is the universal set of 900 residents. We are given:\n\n- |D| = 195\n- |G| = 367\n- |S| = 562\n- 437 residents own exactly two of the four items.\n- 234 residents own exactly three of the four items.\n\nWe need to find the number of residents who own all four items, denoted as \\( d \\).\n\n### Key Steps:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( a \\) be the number of residents who own only candy hearts.\n   - Let \\( b \\) be the number of residents who own exactly two items.\n   - Let \\( c \\) be the number of residents who own exactly three items.\n   - Let \\( d \\) be the number of residents who own all four items.\n\n   From the problem, \\( b = 437 \\), \\( c = 234 \\), and the total number of residents is 900. Thus:\n   \\[\n   a + b + c + d = 900 \\implies a + d = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**\n   Using the inclusion-exclusion principle for sets D, G, and S:\n   \\[\n   |D \\cup G \\cup S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \\cap G| - |D \\cap S| - |G \\cap S| + |D \\cap G \\cap S|\n   \\]\n   Since all residents own candy hearts, \\( |D \\cup G \\cup S| = 900 - a \\). Substituting \\( a = 229 - d \\):\n   \\[\n   |D \\cup G \\cup S| = 900 - (229 - d) = 671 + d\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Intersections:**\n   The intersections \\( |D \\cap G| \\), \\( |D \\cap S| \\), and \\( |G \\cap S| \\) include residents who own exactly two or all three items. Thus:\n   \\[\n   |D \\cap G| = w + d, \\quad |D \\cap S| = u + d, \\quad |G \\cap S| = v + d\n   \\]\n   where \\( w, u, v \\) are the numbers of residents owning exactly three items (C, D, G), (C, D, S), and (C, G, S), respectively.\n\n4. **Substitute into Inclusion-Exclusion Formula:**\n   Substituting into the formula:\n   \\[\n   671 + d = 195 + 367 + 562 - (w + d + u + d + v + d) + d\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   671 + d = 1124 - (234 + 3d) + d\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   671 + d = 890 - 2d\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( d \\):\n   \\[\n   3d = 219 \\implies d = 73\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe number of residents who own all four items is \\(\\boxed{73}\\).",
