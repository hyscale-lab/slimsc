      "reasoning_text": "Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.\n\nWe have three points: O at (0,0), which is the origin. Then, point A is at (1/2, 0), so that's halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0). Point B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is somewhere along the y-axis. So, the first thing I might want to do is sketch this out to visualize where these points are.\n\nThen, we have a family of segments F, which are all segments PQ of unit length. These segments lie in the first quadrant, with point P on the x-axis and point Q on the y-axis. So each segment PQ starts on the x-axis, goes up to the y-axis, and the distance between P and Q is 1 unit. So for example, if P is at (a,0), then Q must be at (0, b) such that sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 1. That makes sense because the distance between (a,0) and (0,b) is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2).\n\nSo the family F consists of all such segments where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, PQ is length 1, and they're in the first quadrant. So each segment is like a line from (a,0) to (0,b), with a and b positive, and a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1.\n\nNow, the problem states that there's a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments in F, right? Because AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's check if AB is of unit length.\n\nCalculating AB's length: distance between (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). So sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. Yep, AB is in F.\n\nSo, the point C is on AB but not on any other segment from F. So, we need to find this point C such that it's only on AB and not on any other PQ in F.\n\nOur goal is to find OC\u00b2, where O is the origin, and then express it as a reduced fraction p/q and find p + q.\n\nAlright, so how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, perhaps parametrize the line AB. Let's find the equation of AB. Points A and B are given, so I can find the slope and equation.\n\nPoint A: (1/2, 0)\nPoint B: (0, sqrt(3)/2)\n\nSo the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).\n\nSo the equation of AB can be written in point-slope form. Using point A: y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2).\n\nAlternatively, using point B: y - sqrt(3)/2 = -sqrt(3)(x - 0), which gives y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Same result.\n\nSo any point C on AB can be written as (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nNow, we need to find a point C on AB such that C is not on any other segment PQ from F except for AB itself. So, for any other PQ in F, C shouldn't lie on PQ.\n\nSo, if I can find the locus of all such points C that lie on AB and on some PQ in F, then the point C we're looking for is the one that's only on AB and not on any other PQ in F. That is, it's the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of all these segments PQ.\n\nWait, that might be a good way to think about it. The envelope of the family of lines F would form some curve, and AB is one of these lines. The point C is where AB is tangent to this envelope, meaning it's the only point where AB intersects the envelope. All other points on AB would intersect the envelope at another PQ, but at C, it's just touching, so C is only on AB and not on any other PQ.\n\nSo, to find C, we can compute the envelope of the family F and then find the point of tangency between AB and this envelope.\n\nSo, how do I compute the envelope of the family of lines F?\n\nEach segment PQ in F is a line from (a, 0) to (0, b), with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, the equation of PQ is x/a + y/b = 1, right? Because the intercept form of a line is x/(intercept on x-axis) + y/(intercept on y-axis) = 1.\n\nSo, the equation is x/a + y/b = 1, with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, the family of lines is given by F: x/a + y/b = 1, with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1, and a, b > 0.\n\nTo find the envelope of this family, I can use the method where we solve for the condition that a parameter (here, a and b) satisfies both the equation and the derivative condition.\n\nAlternatively, since a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1, we can parameterize a and b using an angle theta. Let\u2019s see:\n\nLet\u2019s set a = cos(theta), b = sin(theta). Because then a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = cos\u00b2(theta) + sin\u00b2(theta) = 1. So this satisfies the condition.\n\nSo, each line PQ can be written as x/cos(theta) + y/sin(theta) = 1.\n\nSo, the equation is x sec(theta) + y csc(theta) = 1.\n\nNow, to find the envelope, we can treat theta as a parameter and find the envelope by solving the system:\n\nF: x sec(theta) + y csc(theta) = 1\n\nand\n\ndF/d(theta) = 0.\n\nSo, compute the derivative of F with respect to theta and set it to zero.\n\nLet me compute dF/d(theta):\n\nd/d(theta) [x sec(theta) + y csc(theta)] = x sec(theta) tan(theta) - y csc(theta) cot(theta) = 0.\n\nSo, the condition is x sec(theta) tan(theta) - y csc(theta) cot(theta) = 0.\n\nSimplify this equation.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nx sec(theta) tan(theta) = y csc(theta) cot(theta)\n\nExpress sec(theta) as 1/cos(theta), tan(theta) as sin(theta)/cos(theta), csc(theta) as 1/sin(theta), cot(theta) as cos(theta)/sin(theta).\n\nSubstituting:\n\nx (1/cos(theta)) (sin(theta)/cos(theta)) = y (1/sin(theta)) (cos(theta)/sin(theta))\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft side: x (sin(theta) / cos\u00b2(theta))\n\nRight side: y (cos(theta) / sin\u00b2(theta))\n\nSo,\n\nx sin(theta) / cos\u00b2(theta) = y cos(theta) / sin\u00b2(theta)\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u00b2(theta) sin\u00b2(theta):\n\nx sin\u00b3(theta) = y cos\u00b3(theta)\n\nSo,\n\nx sin\u00b3(theta) = y cos\u00b3(theta)\n\nOr,\n\n(x/y) = (cos\u00b3(theta) / sin\u00b3(theta)) = (cos(theta)/sin(theta))\u00b3 = cot\u00b3(theta)\n\nSo,\n\n(x/y) = cot\u00b3(theta)\n\nSo,\n\ncot(theta) = (x/y)^(1/3)\n\nAlternatively,\n\ntheta = arccot( (x/y)^(1/3) )\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly. Let's see.\n\nWe can also express this as tan(theta) = (y/x)^(1/3).\n\nBut maybe it's better to express sin(theta) and cos(theta) in terms of x and y.\n\nAlternatively, let's go back to the equation x sin\u00b3(theta) = y cos\u00b3(theta). Let's denote t = theta.\n\nSo,\n\nx sin\u00b3(t) = y cos\u00b3(t)\n\n=> x = y (cos(t)/sin(t))\u00b3\n\n= y cot\u00b3(t)\n\nSo, x = y cot\u00b3(t)\n\nFrom the envelope condition, we have:\n\nx sec(t) + y csc(t) = 1\n\nLet me substitute x from above into this equation.\n\nx = y cot\u00b3(t), so substitute into x sec(t) + y csc(t) = 1:\n\ny cot\u00b3(t) * sec(t) + y csc(t) = 1\n\nFactor out y:\n\ny [ cot\u00b3(t) sec(t) + csc(t) ] = 1\n\nExpress cot(t) as cos(t)/sin(t), sec(t) as 1/cos(t), csc(t) as 1/sin(t):\n\ny [ (cos\u00b3(t)/sin\u00b3(t)) * (1/cos(t)) + (1/sin(t)) ] = 1\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\nFirst term: cos\u00b3(t)/sin\u00b3(t) * 1/cos(t) = cos\u00b2(t)/sin\u00b3(t)\n\nSecond term: 1/sin(t)\n\nSo, we have:\n\ny [ cos\u00b2(t)/sin\u00b3(t) + 1/sin(t) ] = 1\n\nFactor out 1/sin(t):\n\ny [ (cos\u00b2(t) + sin\u00b2(t)) / sin\u00b3(t) ) ] = 1\n\nWait, cos\u00b2(t) + sin\u00b2(t) = 1, so:\n\ny [ 1 / sin\u00b3(t) ] = 1\n\nSo,\n\ny = sin\u00b3(t)\n\nSimilarly, from x = y cot\u00b3(t), and y = sin\u00b3(t), so:\n\nx = sin\u00b3(t) * cot\u00b3(t)\n\n= sin\u00b3(t) * (cos(t)/sin(t))\u00b3\n\n= sin\u00b3(t) * cos\u00b3(t)/sin\u00b3(t)\n\n= cos\u00b3(t)\n\nSo, we have:\n\nx = cos\u00b3(t)\n\ny = sin\u00b3(t)\n\nSo, the envelope is given parametrically by x = cos\u00b3(t), y = sin\u00b3(t). That is, the astroid.\n\nWait, I remember that the envelope of such lines x/a + y/b = 1 with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1 is an astroid given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nLet me check: If x = cos\u00b3(t), y = sin\u00b3(t), then x^(2/3) = cos\u00b2(t), y^(2/3) = sin\u00b2(t), so x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = cos\u00b2(t) + sin\u00b2(t) = 1. Yes, that's correct. So the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nSo, the envelope is the astroid, and AB is one of the lines in the family F. The point C is the point where AB is tangent to this astroid. So, we need to find the point of tangency between AB and the astroid.\n\nSo, the point C lies on both AB and the astroid, and at that point, the two curves are tangent, meaning they share a common tangent line.\n\nAlternatively, since AB is already a line in F, the envelope is the astroid, so AB is tangent to the astroid at point C.\n\nWait, but AB is in F, so when we take the envelope, AB is part of the boundary of the envelope. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, actually, each PQ is a line in F, and the envelope is the astroid, so AB is one of the lines that just touches the astroid at point C.\n\nWait, but AB is a line in F, so it's one of the lines that makes up the envelope. So, AB is tangent to the astroid at point C, which is the only point where AB and the astroid meet.\n\nTherefore, point C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nSo, to find C, we can find the point of tangency between AB and the astroid.\n\nGiven that AB has the equation y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe can substitute this into the astroid equation and find the point where they are tangent, which would give a single solution (i.e., discriminant zero).\n\nAlternatively, since the astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1, and AB is y = m x + c, where m is the slope (-sqrt(3)) and c is sqrt(3)/2.\n\nLet me write down the system:\n\n1. x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1\n\n2. y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2\n\nWe can substitute equation 2 into equation 1.\n\nLet me denote y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting into equation 1:\n\nx^(2/3) + [ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) ]^(2/3) = 1\n\nThis looks complicated, but perhaps we can find the point of tangency by using calculus. The derivative of the astroid at point C should be equal to the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).\n\nLet me compute the derivative of the astroid implicitly.\n\nDifferentiating x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1 with respect to x:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx = 0\n\nSo,\n\ndy/dx = - [ (2/3)x^(-1/3) ] / [ (2/3)y^(-1/3) ] = - (x^(-1/3)) / (y^(-1/3)) ) = - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3))\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent to the astroid at any point (x, y) is - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)).\n\nBut we know that at point C, the slope is -sqrt(3). So,\n\n- (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3)\n\nSimplify:\n\n(y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)) = sqrt(3)\n\n=> y^(1/3) = sqrt(3) x^(1/3)\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3:\n\ny = (sqrt(3))^3 x = 3*sqrt(3) x\n\nWait, (sqrt(3))^3 is (3)^(3/2) = 3*sqrt(3).\n\nSo, y = 3*sqrt(3) x\n\nBut we also know that point C lies on AB, whose equation is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, set 3*sqrt(3)x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nLet me solve for x.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n3*sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2 = 0\n\nFactor sqrt(3)x:\n\nsqrt(3)x (3 + 1) - sqrt(3)/2 = 0\n\nWhich is:\n\n4 sqrt(3) x - sqrt(3)/2 = 0\n\nFactor sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(3) (4x - 1/2) = 0\n\nSince sqrt(3) \u2260 0, 4x - 1/2 = 0 => 4x = 1/2 => x = 1/8.\n\nSo, x = 1/8.\n\nThen, y = 3*sqrt(3) * (1/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nWait, but let me check this. Because from the slope condition, we have y = 3 sqrt(3) x, and from AB, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting x = 1/8 into y = 3 sqrt(3) x gives y = 3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nBut let's check if this point lies on AB:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let's verify if this point lies on the astroid.\n\nCompute x^(2/3) + y^(2/3):\n\nx = 1/8, so x^(2/3) = (1/8)^(2/3) = (1^(2/3))/(8^(2/3)) = 1/(4) = 1/4.\n\ny = 3 sqrt(3)/8, so y^(2/3) = (3 sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(3 sqrt(3)) = 3 * 3^(1/2) = 3^(3/2)\n\nSo, y = 3^(3/2) / 8.\n\nSo, y^(2/3) = (3^(3/2)/8)^(2/3) = (3^(3/2))^(2/3) / (8)^(2/3) = 3^( (3/2)*(2/3) ) / (4) ) = 3^1 /4 = 3/4.\n\nSo, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. Correct, so it does lie on the astroid.\n\nSo, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nTherefore, OC is the distance from the origin to point C, which is sqrt( (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 ).\n\nCompute OC\u00b2:\n\n(1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 1/64 + (9 * 3)/64 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.\n\nWait, 28/64 reduces to 7/16. So, OC\u00b2 = 7/16.\n\nTherefore, p = 7, q = 16, which are coprime. So, p + q = 23.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation for OC\u00b2.\n\n(1/8)^2 = 1/64.\n\n(3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 9 * 3 / 64 = 27/64.\n\nAdding 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. Yep, correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 7 + 16 = 23.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we first identify the family of segments $\\overline{PQ}$ in $\\mathcal{F}$, each of unit length with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis.

So this satisfies the condition.\n\nSo, each line PQ can be written as x/cos(theta) + y/sin(theta) = 1.\n\nSo, the equation is x sec(theta) + y csc(theta) = 1.\n\nNow, to find the envelope, we can treat theta as a parameter and find the envelope by solving the system:\n\nF: x sec(theta) + y csc(theta) = 1\n\nand\n\ndF/d(theta) = 0.\n\nSo, compute the derivative of F with respect to theta and set it to zero.\n\nLet me compute dF/d(theta):\n\nd/d(theta) [x sec(theta) + y csc(theta)] = x sec(theta) tan(theta) - y csc(theta) cot(theta) = 0.\n\nSo, the condition is x sec(theta) tan(theta) - y csc(theta) cot(theta) = 0.\n\nSimplify this equation.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nx sec(theta) tan(theta) = y csc(theta) cot(theta)\n\nExpress sec(theta) as 1/cos(theta), tan(theta) as sin(theta)/cos(theta), csc(theta) as 1/sin(theta), cot(theta) as cos(theta)/sin(theta).\n\nSubstituting:\n\nx (1/cos(theta)) (sin(theta)/cos(theta)) = y (1/sin(theta)) (cos(theta)/sin(theta))\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft side: x (sin(theta) / cos\u00b2(theta))\n\nRight side: y (cos(theta) / sin\u00b2(theta))\n\nSo,\n\nx sin(theta) / cos\u00b2(theta) = y cos(theta) / sin\u00b2(theta)\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u00b2(theta) sin\u00b2(theta):\n\nx sin\u00b3(theta) = y cos\u00b3(theta)\n\nSo,\n\nx sin\u00b3(theta) = y cos\u00b3(theta)\n\nOr,\n\n(x/y) = (cos\u00b3(theta) / sin\u00b3(theta)) = (cos(theta)/sin(theta))\u00b3 = cot\u00b3(theta)\n\nSo,\n\n(x/y) = cot\u00b3(theta)\n\nSo,\n\ncot(theta) = (x/y)^(1/3)\n\nAlternatively,\n\ntheta = arccot( (x/y)^(1/3) )\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly. Let's see.\n\nWe can also express this as tan(theta) = (y/x)^(1/3).\n\nBut maybe it's better to express sin(theta) and cos(theta) in terms of x and y.\n\nAlternatively, let's go back to the equation x sin\u00b3(theta) = y cos\u00b3(theta). Let's denote t = theta.\n\nSo,\n\nx sin\u00b3(t) = y cos\u00b3(t)\n\n=> x = y (cos(t)/sin(t))\u00b3\n\n= y cot\u00b3(t)\n\nSo, x = y cot\u00b3(t)\n\nFrom the envelope condition, we have:\n\nx sec(t) + y csc(t) = 1\n\nLet me substitute x from above into this equation.\n\nx = y cot\u00b3(t), so substitute into x sec(t) + y csc(t) = 1:\n\ny cot\u00b3(t) * sec(t) + y csc(t) = 1\n\nFactor out y:\n\ny [ cot\u00b3(t) sec(t) + csc(t) ] = 1\n\nExpress cot(t) as cos(t)/sin(t), sec(t) as 1/cos(t), csc(t) as 1/sin(t):\n\ny [ (cos\u00b3(t)/sin\u00b3(t)) * (1/cos(t)) + (1/sin(t)) ] = 1\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\nFirst term: cos\u00b3(t)/sin\u00b3(t) * 1/cos(t) = cos\u00b2(t)/sin\u00b3(t)\n\nSecond term: 1/sin(t)\n\nSo, we have:\n\ny [ cos\u00b2(t)/sin\u00b3(t) + 1/sin(t) ] = 1\n\nFactor out 1/sin(t):\n\ny [ (cos\u00b2(t) + sin\u00b2(t)) / sin\u00b3(t) ) ] = 1\n\nWait, cos\u00b2(t) + sin\u00b2(t) = 1, so:\n\ny [ 1 / sin\u00b3(t) ] = 1\n\nSo,\n\ny = sin\u00b3(t)\n\nSimilarly, from x = y cot\u00b3(t), and y = sin\u00b3(t), so:\n\nx = sin\u00b3(t) * cot\u00b3(t)\n\n= sin\u00b3(t) * (cos(t)/sin(t))\u00b3\n\n= sin\u00b3(t) * cos\u00b3(t)/sin\u00b3(t)\n\n= cos\u00b3(t)\n\nSo, we have:\n\nx = cos\u00b3(t)\n\ny = sin\u00b3(t)\n\nSo, the envelope is given parametrically by x = cos\u00b3(t), y = sin\u00b3(t). That is, the astroid.\n\nWait, I remember that the envelope of such lines x/a + y/b = 1 with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1 is an astroid given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nLet me check: If x = cos\u00b3(t), y = sin\u00b3(t), then x^(2/3) = cos\u00b2(t), y^(2/3) = sin\u00b2(t), so x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = cos\u00b2(t) + sin\u00b2(t) = 1. Yes, that's correct. So the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nSo, the envelope is the astroid, and AB is one of the lines in the family F. The point C is the point where AB is tangent to this astroid. So, we need to find the point of tangency between AB and the astroid.\n\nSo, the point C lies on both AB and the astroid, and at that point, the two curves are tangent, meaning they share a common tangent line.\n\nAlternatively, since AB is already a line in F, the envelope is the astroid, so AB is tangent to the astroid at point C.\n\nWait, but AB is in F, so when we take the envelope, AB is part of the boundary of the envelope. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, actually, each PQ is a line in F, and the envelope is the astroid, so AB is one of the lines that just touches the astroid at point C.\n\nWait, but AB is a line in F, so it's one of the lines that makes up the envelope. So, AB is tangent to the astroid at point C, which is the only point where AB and the astroid meet.\n\nTherefore, point C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nSo, to find C, we can find the point of tangency between AB and the astroid.\n\nGiven that AB has the equation y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe can substitute this into the astroid equation and find the point where they are tangent, which would give a single solution (i.e., discriminant zero).\n\nAlternatively, since the astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1, and AB is y = m x + c, where m is the slope (-sqrt(3)) and c is sqrt(3)/2.\n\nLet me write down the system:\n\n1. x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1\n\n2. y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2\n\nWe can substitute equation 2 into equation 1.\n\nLet me denote y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting into equation 1:\n\nx^(2/3) + [ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) ]^(2/3) = 1\n\nThis looks complicated, but perhaps we can find the point of tangency by using calculus. The derivative of the astroid at point C should be equal to the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).\n\nLet me compute the derivative of the astroid implicitly.\n\nDifferentiating x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1 with respect to x:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx = 0\n\nSo,\n\ndy/dx = - [ (2/3)x^(-1/3) ] / [ (2/3)y^(-1/3) ] = - (x^(-1/3)) / (y^(-1/3)) ) = - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3))\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent to the astroid at any point (x, y) is - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)).\n\nBut we know that at point C, the slope is -sqrt(3). So,\n\n- (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3)\n\nSimplify:\n\n(y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)) = sqrt(3)\n\n=> y^(1/3) = sqrt(3) x^(1/3)\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3:\n\ny = (sqrt(3))^3 x = 3*sqrt(3) x\n\nWait, (sqrt(3))^3 is (3)^(3/2) = 3*sqrt(3).\n\nSo, y = 3*sqrt(3) x\n\nBut we also know that point C lies on AB, whose equation is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, set 3*sqrt(3)x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nLet me solve for x.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n3*sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2 = 0\n\nFactor sqrt(3)x:\n\nsqrt(3)x (3 + 1) - sqrt(3)/2 = 0\n\nWhich is:\n\n4 sqrt(3) x - sqrt(3)/2 = 0\n\nFactor sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(3) (4x - 1/2) = 0\n\nSince sqrt(3) \u2260 0, 4x - 1/2 = 0 => 4x = 1/2 => x = 1/8.\n\nSo, x = 1/8.\n\nThen, y = 3*sqrt(3) * (1/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nWait, but let me check this. Because from the slope condition, we have y = 3 sqrt(3) x, and from AB, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting x = 1/8 into y = 3 sqrt(3) x gives y = 3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nBut let's check if this point lies on AB:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let's verify if this point lies on the astroid.\n\nCompute x^(2/3) + y^(2/3):\n\nx = 1/8, so x^(2/3) = (1/8)^(2/3) = (1^(2/3))/(8^(2/3)) = 1/(4) = 1/4.\n\ny = 3 sqrt(3)/8, so y^(2/3) = (3 sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(3 sqrt(3)) = 3 * 3^(1/2) = 3^(3/2)\n\nSo, y = 3^(3/2) / 8.\n\nSo, y^(2/3) = (3^(3/2)/8)^(2/3) = (3^(3/2))^(2/3) / (8)^(2/3) = 3^( (3/2)*(2/3) ) / (4) ) = 3^1 /4 = 3/4.\n\nSo, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. Correct, so it does lie on the astroid.\n\nSo, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nTherefore, OC is the distance from the origin to point C, which is sqrt( (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 ).\n\nCompute OC\u00b2:\n\n(1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 1/64 + (9 * 3)/64 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.\n\nWait, 28/64 reduces to 7/16. So, OC\u00b2 = 7/16.\n\nTherefore, p = 7, q = 16, which are coprime. So, p + q = 23.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation for OC\u00b2.\n\n(1/8)^2 = 1/64.\n\n(3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 9 * 3 / 64 = 27/64.\n\nAdding 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. Yep, correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 7 + 16 = 23.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first identify the family of segments $\\overline{PQ}$ in $\\mathcal{F}$, each of unit length with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. The equation of each segment $\\overline{PQ}$ is given by $\\frac{x}{a} + \\frac{y}{b} = 1$ with $a^2 + b^2 = 1$. \n\nWe then determine the envelope of these segments, which forms an astroid described by $x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1$. The line $\\overline{AB}$ is tangent to this astroid at the unique point $C$. \n\nThe equation of $\\overline{AB}$ is $y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. To find the point of tangency, we set the slope of the tangent to the astroid equal to $-\\sqrt{3}$. Solving the system of equations for the astroid and the line, we find the coordinates of $C$ to be $\\left(\\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\right)$. \n\nFinally, we calculate $OC^2$ as $\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{27}{64} = \\frac{28}{64} = \\frac{7}{16}$. Thus, $OC^2 = \\frac{7}{16}$, leading to $p + q = 7 + 16 = 23$.\n\n$\\boxed{23}$",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the value of OC\u00b2 where point C is on segment AB, but it's not A or B. The catch is that this point C doesn't lie on any other segment from the family F except AB. The family F consists of all segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. \n\nFirst, let me try to visualize this. Points O, A, and B are given. O is at the origin, A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, OA is a horizontal line segment from (0,0) to (1/2, 0), and OB is a vertical line segment from (0,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). The segment AB connects these two points, so AB is a line from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). I can maybe draw this or at least sketch it mentally.\n\nNext, the family F is all the segments PQ of length 1, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, both in the first quadrant. So, each such segment PQ connects a point (p, 0) on the x-axis to (0, q) on the y-axis, and the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is 1. The distance formula gives sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, so p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. Therefore, for each such segment PQ, p and q satisfy this equation. So, p can range from 0 to 1, and similarly for q.\n\nSo, the family F is all such segments PQ where (p, 0) and (0, q) are on the axes, and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, each PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p and q related by p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nNow, the problem states that there is a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is in F because the length of AB is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So AB is one such segment in F.\n\nBut we need to find a point C on AB that is not on any other segment from F except AB. So, for every other segment PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, C is unique in that sense.\n\nOur goal is to find OC\u00b2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express OC\u00b2 as p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.\n\nAlright, so I need to find point C on AB such that it's not on any other segment from F except AB. So, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope formed by the family F? Or maybe it's the point where AB is the only segment passing through it.\n\nWait, another thought: the family F consists of all segments PQ of length 1 from the x-axis to the y-axis. So, each segment PQ is like a line from (p,0) to (0,q), with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, the equation of each PQ can be found. Let's find the equation of a general PQ.\n\nGiven points P(p, 0) and Q(0, q), the line PQ can be written in intercept form as x/p + y/q = 1. But since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, we can write q in terms of p, or p in terms of q.\n\nWait, so for each PQ, the line is x/p + y/q = 1, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, the family of lines is x/p + y/q = 1, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nBut perhaps we can parametrize this family in terms of a single parameter. Let's say, let p = cos\u03b8, so q = sin\u03b8, since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, \u03b8 ranges from 0 to \u03c0/2 because we're in the first quadrant.\n\nTherefore, each PQ can be parametrized as x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 = 1, where \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2.\n\nSo, the family of lines is given by x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 = 1.\n\nNow, the envelope of this family of lines is a curve that is tangent to each of these lines. The envelope would be the curve that touches each PQ at exactly one point. So, perhaps the envelope is the astroid formed by the lines x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 = 1.\n\nWait, I remember that the envelope of such lines is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me confirm.\n\nThe general method to find the envelope involves taking the derivative of the family with respect to the parameter \u03b8 and solving the system of equations.\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step.\n\nThe equation of the family is F(x, y, \u03b8) = x / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 - 1 = 0.\n\nTo find the envelope, we need to solve F(x, y, \u03b8) = 0 and dF/d\u03b8 = 0.\n\nCompute dF/d\u03b8:\n\ndF/d\u03b8 = x * (sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8) + y * (-cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8) = 0.\n\nSo, the two equations are:\n\n1. x / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 = 1\n2. x * (sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8) - y * (cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8) = 0\n\nLet me write equation 2 as:\n\nx sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 = y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8 to eliminate denominators:\n\nx sin\u00b3\u03b8 = y cos\u00b3\u03b8\n\nSo, x = y (cos\u00b3\u03b8 / sin\u00b3\u03b8) = y (cot\u03b8)^3\n\nLet me denote t = \u03b8 for simplicity.\n\nFrom equation 1: x / cos t + y / sin t = 1\n\nFrom equation 2: x = y (cot t)^3\n\nLet me substitute x from equation 2 into equation 1:\n\n(y (cot t)^3) / cos t + y / sin t = 1\n\nFactor out y:\n\ny [ (cot t)^3 / cos t + 1 / sin t ] = 1\n\nLet me compute (cot t)^3 / cos t:\n\ncot t = cos t / sin t, so (cot t)^3 = cos\u00b3 t / sin\u00b3 t.\n\nSo, (cot t)^3 / cos t = cos\u00b3 t / (sin\u00b3 t cos t) ) = cos\u00b2 t / sin\u00b3 t.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\ny [ (cos\u00b2 t / sin\u00b3 t) + (1 / sin t) ] = 1\n\nFactor 1/sin t:\n\ny [ (cos\u00b2 t / sin\u00b3 t) + (sin\u00b2 t / sin\u00b3 t) ) ] = 1\n\nWait, because 1/sin t is sin\u00b2 t / sin\u00b3 t. So,\n\ny [ (cos\u00b2 t + sin\u00b2 t) / sin\u00b3 t ] = 1\n\nBut cos\u00b2 t + sin\u00b2 t = 1, so:\n\ny [ 1 / sin\u00b3 t ] = 1\n\nThus, y = sin\u00b3 t\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2, x = y (cot t)^3 = y (cos t / sin t)^3\n\nSubstitute y = sin\u00b3 t:\n\nx = sin\u00b3 t * (cos\u00b3 t / sin\u00b3 t ) = cos\u00b3 t\n\nSo, x = cos\u00b3 t and y = sin\u00b3 t.\n\nTherefore, the parametric equations for the envelope are:\n\nx = cos\u00b3 t\n\ny = sin\u00b3 t\n\nSo, to get the Cartesian equation, we can write:\n\nx^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = cos\u00b2 t + sin\u00b2 t = 1\n\nHence, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nSo, the envelope of the family F is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nNow, the problem says that point C is on AB, and it's the unique point on AB (other than A and B) that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB.\n\nWait, so AB is one of the segments in F, as AB has length 1, as we saw earlier.\n\nSo, point C is on AB, and it's not on any other segment in F except AB. So, it's the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.\n\nBecause if AB intersects the envelope at C, and since the envelope is the boundary of the region covered by the family F, then C is the point where AB just touches the envelope. So, beyond that point, AB would intersect other segments from F, but at C, it's the only point where AB meets the envelope.\n\nSo, perhaps point C is the point of tangency between AB and the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nTherefore, to find point C, we can find the point where line AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nSo, first, let's find the equation of line AB.\n\nPoints A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2)\n\nSimplify: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2\n\nSo, the equation is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nNow, we need to find the point where this line is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nTo find the point of tangency, we can parametrize the astroid as x = cos\u00b3 t, y = sin\u00b3 t, as before.\n\nThen, the derivative of the astroid at point t is dy/dx.\n\nCompute dy/dx: since x = cos\u00b3 t, y = sin\u00b3 t.\n\ndx/dt = 3 cos\u00b2 t (-sin t) = -3 cos\u00b2 t sin t\n\ndy/dt = 3 sin\u00b2 t cos t\n\nSo, dy/dx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt) = [3 sin\u00b2 t cos t] / [ -3 cos\u00b2 t sin t ] = - (sin t)/(cos t) = -tan t\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent to the astroid at point t is -tan t.\n\nBut the slope of line AB is -sqrt(3). So, for the line AB to be tangent to the astroid, their slopes must be equal at the point of tangency.\n\nSo, set -tan t = -sqrt(3) => tan t = sqrt(3) => t = \u03c0/3.\n\nSo, t = \u03c0/3.\n\nTherefore, the point of tangency is at t = \u03c0/3.\n\nCompute x and y:\n\nx = cos\u00b3(\u03c0/3) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8\n\nWait, cos(\u03c0/3) is 1/2, so cos\u00b3(\u03c0/3) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8\n\nSimilarly, y = sin\u00b3(\u03c0/3) = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3 sqrt(3))/8\n\nWait, but wait. Let me compute that again.\n\nWait, sin(\u03c0/3) is sqrt(3)/2, so sin\u00b3(\u03c0/3) is (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nSo, the point of tangency is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nBut wait, let's check if this point lies on line AB.\n\nThe equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nPlugging x = 1/8 into AB's equation:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8 + 4 sqrt(3)/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nSo, yes, the point (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8) lies on AB and on the astroid, and the slope of the astroid at that point is -sqrt(3), same as AB. So, it is indeed the point of tangency.\n\nSo, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nTherefore, OC is the distance from the origin to C, so OC\u00b2 is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(1/8)^2 = 1/64\n\n(3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 9 * 3 / 64 = 27/64\n\nSo, OC\u00b2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.\n\nSimplify 7/16, which is already in lowest terms since 7 and 16 are coprime.\n\nSo, p = 7, q = 16, so p + q = 23.\n\nWait, but hold on. The problem says that C is on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any other segment from F except AB.\n\nBut I found that the point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8). Let me confirm if this is correct.\n\nWait, AB goes from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8), which is between A and B.\n\nBut let me check if there are other points on AB that might also lie on some other PQ from F.\n\nWait, but since AB is tangent to the envelope at C, which is the astroid, then for all other points on AB beyond C towards A or B, those points would lie inside the envelope, meaning that they are on some other PQ from F. Therefore, C is the unique point on AB that is not on any other PQ except AB.\n\nTherefore, OC\u00b2 is 7/16, so p + q = 7 + 16 = 23.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again.\n\nThe astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1 is the envelope of the family F. So, any point inside the astroid is not on any PQ from F. Points on the astroid are on exactly one PQ from F, and points outside are on none. Wait, no, that might not be right.\n\nActually, the envelope is the boundary where each point is on exactly one PQ from F. Points inside the envelope can be on multiple PQs, but points outside are on none. Wait, no, perhaps the opposite. Because each PQ is a line segment from the x-axis to the y-axis, the region they cover is the area inside the astroid.\n\nWait, I might have to think differently. If the envelope is the astroid, then the area inside the astroid is covered by the family F, meaning that any point inside the astroid lies on at least one PQ from F. So, point C is on AB and on the envelope, so it's the boundary point where AB just touches the envelope. So, beyond that point, the line AB would exit the envelope and wouldn't intersect any other PQ from F, but since AB is part of F, the point C is where AB is tangent, so any point on AB beyond C would lie inside the envelope and thus on some other PQ.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think again.\n\nEach PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, as p varies from 0 to 1, q varies from 1 to 0. The lines PQ form a family of lines that sweep across the first quadrant, each of length 1.\n\nThe envelope of these lines is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1, which is the boundary of the region covered by these lines. So, points inside the astroid are covered by some PQ, and points outside are not. So, if a point is on AB and inside the astroid, it's on some PQ from F. But if it's on the envelope, it's only on AB (since AB is part of F). So, point C is where AB is tangent to the envelope, so it's the point where AB just touches the envelope. So, beyond that point, along AB, the points are inside the envelope and thus lie on other PQs from F.\n\nTherefore, the point C is the unique point on AB that's not on any other PQ except AB. So, that's consistent with the problem statement.\n\nSo, OC\u00b2 is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. So, 7 and 16 are coprime, so p + q = 23.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again, just to be sure.\n\nCompute x = cos\u00b3(\u03c0/3):\n\ncos(\u03c0/3) = 0.5, so cos\u00b3(\u03c0/3) = (0.5)^3 = 1/8.\n\nSimilarly, sin(\u03c0/3) = sqrt(3)/2, so sin\u00b3(\u03c0/3) = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3*sqrt(3))/8.\n\nSo, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nThen, OC\u00b2 is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/8)^2 = 1/64.\n\n(3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 9 * 3 / 64 = 27/64.\n\nSum is 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 7/16, so p + q = 7 + 16 = 23.\n\nI think that's solid.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the value of OC\u00b2 where point C is on segment AB, but it's not A or B. The catch is that this point C doesn't lie on any other segment from the family F except AB. The family F consists of all segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. \n\nFirst, let me try to visualize this. Points O, A, and B are given. O is at the origin, A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, OA is a horizontal line segment from (0,0) to (1/2, 0), and OB is a vertical line segment from (0,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). The segment AB connects these two points, so AB is a line from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). I can maybe draw this or at least sketch it mentally.\n\nNext, the family F is all the segments PQ of length 1, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, both in the first quadrant. So, each such segment PQ connects a point (p, 0) on the x-axis to (0, q) on the y-axis, and the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is 1. The distance formula gives sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, so p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. Therefore, for each such segment PQ, p and q satisfy this equation. So, p can range from 0 to 1, and similarly for q.\n\nSo, the family F is all such segments PQ where (p, 0) and (0, q) are on the axes, and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, each PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p and q related by p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nNow, the problem states that there is a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is in F because the length of AB is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So AB is one such segment in F.\n\nBut we need to find a point C on AB that is not on any other segment from F except AB. So, for every other segment PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, C is unique in that sense.\n\nOur goal is to find OC\u00b2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express OC\u00b2 as p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.\n\nAlright, so I need to find point C on AB such that it's not on any other segment from F except AB. So, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope formed by the family F? Or maybe it's the point where AB is the only segment passing through it.\n\nWait, another thought: the family F consists of all segments PQ of length 1 from the x-axis to the y-axis. So, each segment PQ is like a line from (p,0) to (0,q), with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, the equation of each PQ can be found. Let's find the equation of a general PQ.\n\nGiven points P(p, 0) and Q(0, q), the line PQ can be written in intercept form as x/p + y/q = 1. But since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, we can write q in terms of p, or p in terms of q.\n\nWait, so for each PQ, the line is x/p + y/q = 1, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, the family of lines is x/p + y/q = 1, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nBut perhaps we can parametrize this family in terms of a single parameter. Let's say, let p = cos\u03b8, so q = sin\u03b8, since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, \u03b8 ranges from 0 to \u03c0/2 because we're in the first quadrant.\n\nTherefore, each PQ can be parametrized as x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 = 1, where \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2.\n\nSo, the family of lines is given by x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 = 1.\n\nNow, the envelope of this family of lines is a curve that is tangent to each of these lines. The envelope would be the curve that touches each PQ at exactly one point. So, perhaps the envelope is the astroid formed by the lines x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 = 1.\n\nWait, I remember that the envelope of such lines is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me confirm.\n\nThe general method to find the envelope involves taking the derivative of the family with respect to the parameter \u03b8 and solving the system of equations.\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step.\n\nThe equation of the family is F(x, y, \u03b8) = x / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 - 1 = 0.\n\nTo find the envelope, we need to solve F(x, y, \u03b8) = 0 and dF/d\u03b8 = 0.\n\nCompute dF/d\u03b8:\n\ndF/d\u03b8 = x * (sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8) + y * (-cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8) = 0.\n\nSo, the two equations are:\n\n1. x / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 = 1\n2. x * (sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8) - y * (cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8) = 0\n\nLet me write equation 2 as:\n\nx sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 = y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8 to eliminate denominators:\n\nx sin\u00b3\u03b8 = y cos\u00b3\u03b8\n\nSo, x = y (cos\u00b3\u03b8 / sin\u00b3\u03b8) = y (cot\u03b8)^3\n\nLet me denote t = \u03b8 for simplicity.\n\nFrom equation 1: x / cos t + y / sin t = 1\n\nFrom equation 2: x = y (cot t)^3\n\nLet me substitute x from equation 2 into equation 1:\n\n(y (cot t)^3) / cos t + y / sin t = 1\n\nFactor out y:\n\ny [ (cot t)^3 / cos t + 1 / sin t ] = 1\n\nLet me compute (cot t)^3 / cos t:\n\ncot t = cos t / sin t, so (cot t)^3 = cos\u00b3 t / sin\u00b3 t.\n\nSo, (cot t)^3 / cos t = cos\u00b3 t / (sin\u00b3 t cos t) ) = cos\u00b2 t / sin\u00b3 t.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\ny [ (cos\u00b2 t / sin\u00b3 t) + (1 / sin t) ] = 1\n\nFactor 1/sin t:\n\ny [ (cos\u00b2 t / sin\u00b3 t) + (sin\u00b2 t / sin\u00b3 t) ) ] = 1\n\nWait, because 1/sin t is sin\u00b2 t / sin\u00b3 t. So,\n\ny [ (cos\u00b2 t + sin\u00b2 t) / sin\u00b3 t ] = 1\n\nBut cos\u00b2 t + sin\u00b2 t = 1, so:\n\ny [ 1 / sin\u00b3 t ] = 1\n\nThus, y = sin\u00b3 t\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2, x = y (cot t)^3 = y (cos t / sin t)^3\n\nSubstitute y = sin\u00b3 t:\n\nx = sin\u00b3 t * (cos\u00b3 t / sin\u00b3 t ) = cos\u00b3 t\n\nSo, x = cos\u00b3 t and y = sin\u00b3 t.\n\nTherefore, the parametric equations for the envelope are:\n\nx = cos\u00b3 t\n\ny = sin\u00b3 t\n\nSo, to get the Cartesian equation, we can write:\n\nx^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = cos\u00b2 t + sin\u00b2 t = 1\n\nHence, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nSo, the envelope of the family F is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nNow, the problem says that point C is on AB, and it's the unique point on AB (other than A and B) that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB.\n\nWait, so AB is one of the segments in F, as AB has length 1, as we saw earlier.\n\nSo, point C is on AB, and it's not on any other segment in F except AB. So, it's the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.\n\nBecause if AB intersects the envelope at C, and since the envelope is the boundary of the region covered by the family F, then C is the point where AB just touches the envelope. So, beyond that point, AB would intersect other segments from F, but at C, it's the only point where AB meets the envelope.\n\nSo, perhaps point C is the point of tangency between AB and the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nTherefore, to find point C, we can find the point where line AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nSo, first, let's find the equation of line AB.\n\nPoints A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2)\n\nSimplify: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2\n\nSo, the equation is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nNow, we need to find the point where this line is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nTo find the point of tangency, we can parametrize the astroid as x = cos\u00b3 t, y = sin\u00b3 t, as before.\n\nThen, the derivative of the astroid at point t is dy/dx.\n\nCompute dy/dx: since x = cos\u00b3 t, y = sin\u00b3 t.\n\ndx/dt = 3 cos\u00b2 t (-sin t) = -3 cos\u00b2 t sin t\n\ndy/dt = 3 sin\u00b2 t cos t\n\nSo, dy/dx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt) = [3 sin\u00b2 t cos t] / [ -3 cos\u00b2 t sin t ] = - (sin t)/(cos t) = -tan t\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent to the astroid at point t is -tan t.\n\nBut the slope of line AB is -sqrt(3). So, for the line AB to be tangent to the astroid, their slopes must be equal at the point of tangency.\n\nSo, set -tan t = -sqrt(3) => tan t = sqrt(3) => t = \u03c0/3.\n\nSo, t = \u03c0/3.\n\nTherefore, the point of tangency is at t = \u03c0/3.\n\nCompute x and y:\n\nx = cos\u00b3(\u03c0/3) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8\n\nWait, cos(\u03c0/3) is 1/2, so cos\u00b3(\u03c0/3) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8\n\nSimilarly, y = sin\u00b3(\u03c0/3) = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3 sqrt(3))/8\n\nWait, but wait. Let me compute that again.\n\nWait, sin(\u03c0/3) is sqrt(3)/2, so sin\u00b3(\u03c0/3) is (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nSo, the point of tangency is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nBut wait, let's check if this point lies on line AB.\n\nThe equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nPlugging x = 1/8 into AB's equation:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8 + 4 sqrt(3)/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nSo, yes, the point (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8) lies on AB and on the astroid, and the slope of the astroid at that point is -sqrt(3), same as AB. So, it is indeed the point of tangency.\n\nSo, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nTherefore, OC is the distance from the origin to C, so OC\u00b2 is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(1/8)^2 = 1/64\n\n(3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 9 * 3 / 64 = 27/64\n\nSo, OC\u00b2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.\n\nSimplify 7/16, which is already in lowest terms since 7 and 16 are coprime.\n\nSo, p = 7, q = 16, so p + q = 23.\n\nWait, but hold on. The problem says that C is on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any other segment from F except AB.\n\nBut I found that the point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8). Let me confirm if this is correct.\n\nWait, AB goes from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8), which is between A and B.\n\nBut let me check if there are other points on AB that might also lie on some other PQ from F.\n\nWait, but since AB is tangent to the envelope at C, which is the astroid, then for all other points on AB beyond C towards A or B, those points would lie inside the envelope, meaning that they are on some other PQ from F. Therefore, C is the unique point on AB that is not on any other PQ except AB.\n\nTherefore, OC\u00b2 is 7/16, so p + q = 7 + 16 = 23.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again.\n\nThe astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1 is the envelope of the family F. So, any point inside the astroid is not on any PQ from F. Points on the astroid are on exactly one PQ from F, and points outside are on none. Wait, no, that might not be right.\n\nActually, the envelope is the boundary where each point is on exactly one PQ from F. Points inside the envelope can be on multiple PQs, but points outside are on none. Wait, no, perhaps the opposite. Because each PQ is a line segment from the x-axis to the y-axis, the region they cover is the area inside the astroid.\n\nWait, I might have to think differently. If the envelope is the astroid, then the area inside the astroid is covered by the family F, meaning that any point inside the astroid lies on at least one PQ from F. So, point C is on AB and on the envelope, so it's the boundary point where AB just touches the envelope. So, beyond that point, the line AB would exit the envelope and wouldn't intersect any other PQ from F, but since AB is part of F, the point C is where AB is tangent, so any point on AB beyond C would lie inside the envelope and thus on some other PQ.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think again.\n\nEach PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, as p varies from 0 to 1, q varies from 1 to 0. The lines PQ form a family of lines that sweep across the first quadrant, each of length 1.\n\nThe envelope of these lines is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1, which is the boundary of the region covered by these lines. So, points inside the astroid are covered by some PQ, and points outside are not. So, if a point is on AB and inside the astroid, it's on some PQ from F. But if it's on the envelope, it's only on AB (since AB is part of F). So, point C is where AB is tangent to the envelope, so it's the point where AB just touches the envelope. So, beyond that point, along AB, the points are inside the envelope and thus lie on other PQs from F.\n\nTherefore, the point C is the unique point on AB that's not on any other PQ except AB. So, that's consistent with the problem statement.\n\nSo, OC\u00b2 is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. So, 7 and 16 are coprime, so p + q = 23.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again, just to be sure.\n\nCompute x = cos\u00b3(\u03c0/3):\n\ncos(\u03c0/3) = 0.5, so cos\u00b3(\u03c0/3) = (0.5)^3 = 1/8.\n\nSimilarly, sin(\u03c0/3) = sqrt(3)/2, so sin\u00b3(\u03c0/3) = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3*sqrt(3))/8.\n\nSo, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nThen, OC\u00b2 is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/8)^2 = 1/64.\n\n(3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 9 * 3 / 64 = 27/64.\n\nSum is 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 7/16, so p + q = 7 + 16 = 23.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the point \\( C \\) on segment \\( \\overline{AB} \\) that does not lie on any other segment from the family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) except \\( \\overline{AB} \\). The family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) consists of segments \\( \\overline{PQ} \\) of unit length with \\( P \\) on the x-axis and \\( Q \\) on the y-axis. \n\n1. **Equation of Segment \\( \\overline{AB} \\)**:\n   - Points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are at \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{2}, 0 \\right) \\) and \\( \\left( 0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) \\), respectively.\n   - The slope of \\( \\overline{AB} \\) is \\( -\\sqrt{3} \\), giving the equation \\( y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Envelope of the Family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\)**:\n   - The envelope of the family of lines \\( \\frac{x}{\\cos\\theta} + \\frac{y}{\\sin\\theta} = 1 \\) is the astroid \\( x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1 \\).\n\n3. **Point of Tangency**:\n   - The line \\( \\overline{AB} \\) is tangent to the astroid at point \\( C \\). The slope of the astroid at any point \\( t \\) is \\( -\\tan t \\).\n   - Setting this equal to the slope of \\( \\overline{AB} \\) gives \\( \\tan t = \\sqrt{3} \\), so \\( t = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\).\n\n4. **Coordinates of Point \\( C \\)**:\n   - Using the parametric equations of the astroid, \\( x = \\cos^3 t \\) and \\( y = \\sin^3 t \\), we find:\n     - \\( x = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8} \\)\n     - \\( y = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)^3 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8} \\)\n\n5. **Distance \\( OC \\)**:\n   - The distance \\( OC \\) is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     OC^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{8} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{27}{64} = \\frac{28}{64} = \\frac{7}{16}\n     \\]\n\nThus, \\( OC^2 = \\frac{7}{16} \\), and the sum of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) is \\( 7 + 16 = 23 \\).\n\n\\boxed{23}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. \n\nWe have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere up the y-axis. I think sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, so it's a bit less than (0,1). \n\nThen, there's this family F of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant. Each segment PQ has P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, for each such segment, P is (p,0) and Q is (0,q) where p and q are positive real numbers, and the distance between P and Q is 1. \n\nI need to find a point C on segment AB, not equal to A or B, such that C is not on any other segment from F except for AB itself. And then find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. The answer will be a fraction p/q, and I need to find p + q.\n\nHmm. So, first, maybe I should parameterize the segments in F. Each segment PQ has P at (p,0) and Q at (0,q), with sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1. So, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, all these segments are of length 1, lying in the first quadrant with endpoints on the axes.\n\nEach such segment PQ can be described by the equation (x/p) + (y/q) = 1, right? Because it's a line connecting (p,0) to (0,q). So, the intercept form of the line is x/p + y/q = 1.\n\nSo, the family F consists of all lines x/p + y/q = 1 where p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nNow, the point C is on AB, so I should parametrize AB first. Let's find the equation of AB.\n\nPoints A and B are (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the line AB can be found using the two-point form. The slope m is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Plugging in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nNow, the problem says that C is on AB, and it's the unique point on AB (other than A and B) that is not on any other segment from F except for AB itself. So, I think this means that C is the point where all the other segments PQ from F would not pass through C, except for AB. So, in other words, AB is the only segment in F that passes through C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is such that it's the only point on AB that is not intersected by any other segment from F. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, another way: For each point C on AB (other than A and B), we can see if there's another segment PQ in F that also passes through C. If C is unique in the sense that only AB passes through it, then that's our point.\n\nSo, to find such a C, we can set up the condition that there exists a unique pair (p, q) such that the line x/p + y/q = 1 passes through C, and that this is only possible when p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2, which corresponds to the segment AB itself.\n\nSo, suppose C is (x, y), lying on AB, so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nFor C to lie on a segment PQ, which is x/p + y/q =1, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. So, substituting C into the line equation: x/p + y/q =1.\n\nBut since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, we can express q in terms of p or vice versa. Let me try to write this equation:\n\nx/p + y/q =1. But since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, perhaps we can find a relationship between p and q.\n\nLet me express q in terms of p. From p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2). But since q is positive (as Q is on the positive y-axis), we can write q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2).\n\nWait, but then the equation becomes x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) =1.\n\nNow, since C is on AB, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Let's substitute that into the equation:\n\nx/p + [(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)] / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) =1.\n\nThis equation is in terms of x and p. But for C to lie on AB and on some PQ from F, this equation must hold for some p.\n\nBut we want that C is only on AB and no other PQ, so we want that for all other p (other than p=1/2, which gives us AB itself), this equation does not hold. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting it wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the point C is such that when we substitute it into the equation x/p + y/q =1, the only solution is p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2, which corresponds to AB.\n\nSo, to find such a C, we can set up the equation such that there is exactly one solution (p, q) satisfying both x/p + y/q =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, which is the case when the system has only one solution, which is p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWait, but maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps for other points C on AB, there exists another PQ in F that also passes through C. So, we need to find the point C where this isn't possible; that is, no other PQ in F passes through C except AB.\n\nSo, perhaps C is such that the system x/p + y/q =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 has exactly one solution (p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2). So, to ensure that, the equation x/p + y/q =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 must have only that solution. So, we can think of this as a system of equations in p and q, and set the condition that it has only one solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parameterize p and q. Let me think. Let me denote p = cos\u03b8 and q = sin\u03b8, since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. So, \u03b8 is an angle parameterizing the possible points P and Q on the axes.\n\nSo, then the line equation becomes x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) =1. So, for a point C(x, y) to lie on this line, it must satisfy x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) =1.\n\nBut since C is on AB, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Substituting that into the line equation:\n\nx/(cos\u03b8) + [(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)] / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\nx/(cos\u03b8) - (sqrt(3)x)/sin\u03b8 + (sqrt(3)/2)/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nCombine the terms with x:\n\nx [1/cos\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/sin\u03b8] + (sqrt(3)/2)/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\nx * [ (sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8) / (sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8) ) ] + (sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8)) = 1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as:\n\nx * [ (sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8) / (sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8) ) ] = 1 - sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8).\n\nLet me denote numerator as N = sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8.\n\nDenominator as D = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nx * (N / D) = 1 - sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8).\n\nMultiply both sides by D:\n\nx * N = [1 - sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8)] * D.\n\nBut D = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8, so:\n\nx * N = [1 - sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8)] * sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side:\n\n= [1 * sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8] - [sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8) * sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8]\n\n= sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 - (sqrt(3)/2) cos\u03b8\n\n= cos\u03b8 (sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nx * N = cos\u03b8 (sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nBut N = sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8, so:\n\nx (sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8) = cos\u03b8 (sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nHmm, let's write this as:\n\nx sin\u03b8 - x sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 = cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 - (sqrt(3)/2) cos\u03b8.\n\nLet me bring all terms to the left:\n\nx sin\u03b8 - x sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 - cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 + (sqrt(3)/2) cos\u03b8 = 0.\n\nFactor terms:\n\nsin\u03b8 (x - cos\u03b8) + cos\u03b8 (-x sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)/2 ) = 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor sqrt(3):\n\nsin\u03b8 (x - cos\u03b8) + sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ( (-x + 1/2 ) ) =0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let's group terms differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I can collect terms with sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8:\n\nsin\u03b8 (x - cos\u03b8) + cos\u03b8 ( -x sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)/2 ) = 0.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nsin\u03b8 (x - cos\u03b8) + cos\u03b8 [ sqrt(3) ( 1/2 - x ) ] = 0.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor out something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor cos\u03b8:\n\n= cos\u03b8 [ sqrt(3) (1/2 - x) ] + sin\u03b8 (x - cos\u03b8) = 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write this as:\n\ncos\u03b8 [ sqrt(3)(1/2 - x) ] + sin\u03b8 (x - cos\u03b8) =0.\n\nHmm, maybe I can express this as a linear combination of sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8. Let's see:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nA sin\u03b8 + B cos\u03b8 = 0,\n\nwhere A = x - cos\u03b8,\n\nand B = sqrt(3)(1/2 - x).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because in the equation, we have:\n\ncos\u03b8 * [ sqrt(3)(1/2 - x) ] + sin\u03b8 * (x - cos\u03b8) =0.\n\nSo, that would be:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 - x) cos\u03b8 + (x - cos\u03b8) sin\u03b8 = 0.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n[ sqrt(3)(1/2 - x) ] cos\u03b8 + [x - cos\u03b8 ] sin\u03b8 = 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor this differently. Let's see:\n\nLet me expand the terms:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 - x) cos\u03b8 + x sin\u03b8 - cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 =0.\n\nHmm, maybe grouping terms:\n\n= [ sqrt(3)(1/2 - x) - sin\u03b8 ] cos\u03b8 + x sin\u03b8 =0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can rearrange terms:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 - x) cos\u03b8 - cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 + x sin\u03b8 =0.\n\n= cos\u03b8 [ sqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) - sin\u03b8 ] + x sin\u03b8 =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's getting somewhere.\n\nLet me denote:\n\ncos\u03b8 [ sqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) - sin\u03b8 ] + x sin\u03b8 =0.\n\nLet me factor out sqrt(3)(1/2 -x ):\n\n= sqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) cos\u03b8 - cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 + x sin\u03b8 =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8 terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) cos\u03b8 = cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 - x sin\u03b8.\n\nFactor sin\u03b8 on the right:\n\n= sin\u03b8 ( cos\u03b8 - x ).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 ( cos\u03b8 - x ).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 ( cos\u03b8 - x ).\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 (x - cos\u03b8 ) =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor something out. Let me see:\n\nLet me take (1/2 -x ) as a term:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 (x - cos\u03b8 ) =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor (1/2 -x ) and x terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write this as:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + x sin\u03b8 =0.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8 terms:\n\n= [ sqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) - sin\u03b8 ] cos\u03b8 + x sin\u03b8 =0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider this as a linear equation in terms of cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8. Let me denote the equation as:\n\nA cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 =0,\n\nwhere A = sqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) - sin\u03b8,\n\nand B = x.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because A would depend on sin\u03b8, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write this as:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) cos\u03b8 + x sin\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can move everything to one side:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) cos\u03b8 + x sin\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 =0.\n\nFactor terms:\n\n= cos\u03b8 [ sqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) - sin\u03b8 ] + x sin\u03b8 =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that for each C on AB, the equation x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) =1 has a solution \u03b8, except for a particular C where it only has \u03b8 corresponding to AB.\n\nWait, but AB itself is PQ with P at (1/2, 0) and Q at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, for AB, p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2, and indeed (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 =1, so that's correct.\n\nSo, for AB, \u03b8 is such that cos\u03b8 =1/2 and sin\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2, which is \u03b8=60 degrees or \u03c0/3 radians.\n\nSo, perhaps for other points C on AB, there exists another \u03b8 that also satisfies the equation.\n\nBut we want the point C where this equation has only one solution for \u03b8, which is \u03b8=\u03c0/3. So, for that point C, the system x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1 has only one solution, which is \u03b8=\u03c0/3.\n\nHmm, so maybe I can consider the equation x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) =1, along with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1, which is cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8=1.\n\nBut since x and y are fixed for a particular point C, we can think of this equation as a constraint on \u03b8.\n\nSo, maybe I can write x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) =1, and we can find \u03b8 that satisfies this.\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\nx/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) =1.\n\nLet me denote t = tan(\u03b8/2). Then, using the identities cos\u03b8 = (1 - t\u00b2)/(1 + t\u00b2), sin\u03b8 = 2t/(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n\nx * (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) + y * (1 + t\u00b2)/(2t) =1.\n\nHmm, this substitution might complicate things, but perhaps it can lead to a quadratic equation in t, which would have exactly one solution when the discriminant is zero. So, maybe for point C, the equation in t would have exactly one solution, meaning that \u03b8 is uniquely determined, which is the case when AB passes through C.\n\nWait, but actually, we want that for C, the equation in t has only one solution, which would correspond to \u03b8=\u03c0/3, and no other \u03b8. So, perhaps the discriminant of the quadratic equation in t would be zero, leading to a unique solution.\n\nLet me try to write this substitution.\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\nx/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) =1.\n\nExpressed in terms of t, where t = tan(\u03b8/2):\n\ncos\u03b8 = (1 - t\u00b2)/(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2t/(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nx * (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) + y * (1 + t\u00b2)/(2t) =1.\n\nLet me factor out (1 + t\u00b2):\n\n(1 + t\u00b2) [ x/(1 - t\u00b2) + y/(2t) ] =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as:\n\n(1 + t\u00b2) [ (2x t + y (1 - t\u00b2)) / (2t (1 - t\u00b2)) ) ] =1.\n\nWait, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire equation as:\n\nx/( (1 - t\u00b2)/(1 + t\u00b2) ) + y/( (2t)/(1 + t\u00b2) ) =1.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx * (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) + y * (1 + t\u00b2)/(2t) =1.\n\nLet me factor out (1 + t\u00b2):\n\n(1 + t\u00b2) [ x/(1 - t\u00b2) + y/(2t) ] =1.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n(1 + t\u00b2) [ (2x t + y (1 - t\u00b2)) / (2t (1 - t\u00b2)) ) ] =1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to just multiply both sides by 2t(1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2) to eliminate denominators.\n\nSo, multiply both sides by 2t(1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2):\n\n2t(1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2) * [x/(1 - t\u00b2) + y/(2t)] = 2t(1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2) *1.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: 2t(1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2) * x/(1 - t\u00b2) = 2t(1 + t\u00b2) x.\n\nSecond term: 2t(1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2) * y/(2t) = (1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2) y.\n\nSo, left side becomes:\n\n2t(1 + t\u00b2)x + (1 - t^4)y = 2t(1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nWait, 1 - t^4 is (1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2), so that term is (1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2) y.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n2t(1 + t\u00b2)x + (1 - t^4) y = 2t(1 - t^4).\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side:\n\n2t(1 + t\u00b2)x + (1 - t^4) y - 2t(1 - t^4) =0.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should plug in y from AB's equation.\n\nSince C is on AB, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substitute y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into the equation:\n\n2t(1 + t\u00b2)x + (1 - t^4)(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) - 2t(1 - t^4) =0.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n2t(1 + t\u00b2)x - sqrt(3)(1 - t^4)x + (sqrt(3)/2)(1 - t^4) - 2t(1 - t^4) =0.\n\nLet me collect like terms:\n\nx [2t(1 + t\u00b2) - sqrt(3)(1 - t^4)] + [ (sqrt(3)/2)(1 - t^4) - 2t(1 - t^4) ] =0.\n\nFactor out (1 - t^4) from the second bracket:\n\n= x [2t(1 + t\u00b2) - sqrt(3)(1 - t^4)] + (1 - t^4)[ sqrt(3)/2 - 2t ] =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor (1 - t^4) as (1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nBut this might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can set this as a quadratic equation in t.\n\nLet me try to expand the terms:\n\nFirst term: 2t(1 + t\u00b2)x = 2t x + 2t^3 x.\n\nSecond term: -sqrt(3)(1 - t^4)x = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)x t^4.\n\nThird term: sqrt(3)/2 (1 - t^4) = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/2 t^4.\n\nFourth term: -2t(1 - t^4) = -2t + 2t^5.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n2t x + 2t^3 x - sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)x t^4 + sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/2 t^4 -2t + 2t^5 = 0.\n\nNow, let me collect like terms by powers of t:\n\nt^5: 2x t^5.\n\nt^4: sqrt(3)x t^4 - sqrt(3)/2 t^4.\n\nt^3: 2x t^3.\n\nt^2: None.\n\nt: 2x t -2t.\n\nConstants: -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n2x t^5 + [ sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2 ] t^4 + 2x t^3 + (2x -2) t + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) =0.\n\nHmm, this is a quintic equation, which is difficult to solve in general. Maybe I can consider that for the point C where only AB passes through it, the equation has a double root at t corresponding to \u03b8=\u03c0/3.\n\nWait, because if AB is the only segment from F passing through C, then the equation would have a repeated root at t corresponding to \u03b8=\u03c0/3, meaning that the polynomial and its derivative would both be zero at that t.\n\nSo, perhaps I can substitute t = tan(\u03c0/6) because \u03b8=\u03c0/3, so \u03b8/2=\u03c0/6, so tan(\u03c0/6)=1/sqrt(3).\n\nLet me let t0 = 1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo, substituting t = t0 into the equation:\n\n2x t0^5 + [ sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2 ] t0^4 + 2x t0^3 + (2x -2) t0 + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) =0.\n\nAnd also, the derivative of the polynomial with respect to t evaluated at t0 should be zero.\n\nBut this might get very complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for the point C, the equation in t has a double root at t0=1/sqrt(3), so I can set up equations based on that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better approach.\n\nLet me think again. The family of lines is x/p + y/q =1, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1. The point C is on AB, so it's (x, y)= (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2).\n\nWe want that for this point C, the equation x/p + y/q =1 has exactly one solution (p, q) satisfying p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1, which is the case for AB.\n\nSo, to ensure that, when we solve the system x/p + y/q =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1, we get exactly one solution, which would be when the two equations are dependent, i.e., when the line x/p + y/q=1 is tangent to the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1.\n\nWait, that might be a better way to think about it. The condition that the line x/p + y/q=1 is tangent to the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1.\n\nSo, the condition for a line a p + b q = c to be tangent to the unit circle is |c| / sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) =1. So, in this case, the line is x p + y q = p q, since x/p + y/q =1 can be written as x p + y q = p q.\n\nWait, let me check that: x/p + y/q =1 => (x q + y p)/(p q) =1 => x q + y p = p q.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's the right way. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the line equation as x p + y q = p q.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think of it differently.\n\nWait, the line is x/p + y/q =1. Let me rearrange it as (x/p) + (y/q) -1=0. So, in terms of variables p and q, it's a linear equation. The condition that this line is tangent to the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1 is that the distance from the center (0,0) to the line is equal to 1.\n\nWait, but the distance from (0,0) to the line (x/p) + (y/q) -1=0 is |0 + 0 -1| / sqrt( (x/p)^2 + (y/q)^2 ). Wait, no, the standard formula is |Ax + By + C| / sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), where the line is Ax + By + C=0.\n\nWait, but in this case, the line is (x/p) p + (y/q) q -1=0? Wait, no, the line equation is (x/p) + (y/q) =1, which can be written as (x/p) + (y/q) -1 =0. So, in standard form, it's (x/p) p + (y/q) q -1 =0, which doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rearrangement. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the line equation is (x/p) + (y/q) =1. To express this in standard form, it's (x/p) + (y/q) -1 =0. So, the coefficients are A = 1/p, B = 1/q, and C = -1.\n\nSo, the distance from the origin (0,0) to this line is |A*0 + B*0 + C| / sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2) = |C| / sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2) = | -1 | / sqrt( (1/p)^2 + (1/q)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt( (1/p^2) + (1/q^2) ).\n\nFor the line to be tangent to the unit circle p^2 + q^2 =1, this distance must be equal to the radius of the circle, which is 1. So,\n\n1 / sqrt( (1/p^2) + (1/q^2) ) =1.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( (1/p^2) + (1/q^2) ) =1.\n\nSquaring both sides,\n\n1/p^2 + 1/q^2 =1.\n\nBut since p^2 + q^2 =1, we can write:\n\n1/p^2 + 1/q^2 = (p^2 + q^2)/(p^2 q^2) =1/(p^2 q^2) =1.\n\nSo,\n\n1/(p^2 q^2) =1 => p^2 q^2 =1.\n\nBut since p^2 + q^2=1, and p^2 q^2=1, let me see if that's possible.\n\nWait, p^2 + q^2=1 and p^2 q^2=1.\n\nLet me denote a = p^2, b = q^2.\n\nSo,\n\na + b =1,\n\na b =1.\n\nThen, the quadratic equation is t^2 - t +1=0, whose discriminant is 1 -4 = -3 <0.\n\nSo, there are no real solutions. Hmm, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the condition. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the line equation is (x/p) + (y/q) =1, and we want it to be tangent to the unit circle p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nThe condition for a line a p + b q = c to be tangent to the circle p^2 + q^2 = r^2 is |c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = r.\n\nIn our case, the line is (x/p) + (y/q) =1, which can be rewritten as (x) p^{-1} + (y) q^{-1} =1. So, in terms of a p + b q = c, a = x/p, b = y/q, c=1.\n\nWait, no, perhaps that's not the correct way. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the line equation is (x/p) + (y/q) =1. Let me express this as (x)(1/p) + (y)(1/q) =1.\n\nSo, in the standard form a p + b q = c, where p and q are variables, a = x, b = y, c =1.\n\nWait, but p and q are variables in the circle equation p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nSo, the line equation is a p + b q = c, where a = x, b = y, c =1.\n\nThen, the condition for this line to be tangent to the circle p^2 + q^2 =1 is |c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2) =1.\n\nSo,\n\n|1| / sqrt(x^2 + y^2) =1,\n\nwhich implies sqrt(x^2 + y^2) =1,\n\nso x^2 + y^2 =1.\n\nBut wait, that's the equation of a unit circle. So, the condition is that the point (x, y) lies on the unit circle.\n\nBut in our problem, point C is on AB, which is a line from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). The distance from O to AB is the length of the perpendicular from O to AB.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the distance from O to AB. The line AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nThe distance from (0,0) to this line is |0 + 0 - sqrt(3)/2| / sqrt( (sqrt(3))^2 +1^2 ) )= (sqrt(3)/2) / sqrt(4) )= (sqrt(3)/2) / 2 = sqrt(3)/4 \u22480.433.\n\nWhich is less than 1, so the point C lies inside the unit circle.\n\nWait, but according to the condition, if x^2 + y^2 =1, then the line x/p + y/q=1 is tangent to the unit circle p^2 + q^2=1.\n\nBut in our problem, the point C is (x, y) on AB, so unless C lies on the unit circle, the condition won't hold. But our point C is on AB, which is a line from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is at a distance of sqrt(3)/4 from O, so it's inside the unit circle.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried to compute the condition, I ended up with p^2 q^2 =1, which has no real solutions, which suggests that the line can't be tangent to the unit circle unless p and q are complex, which they aren't because they are on the axes in the first quadrant.\n\nHmm, so perhaps my approach is incorrect. Maybe I should try a different method.\n\nLet me think again. For point C on AB, the equation x/p + y/q =1 must have exactly one solution (p, q) on the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1. That solution is AB itself, so p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe need that for any other (p, q) on the unit circle, the line x/p + y/q =1 does not pass through C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is such that when we solve for p and q, the only solution is p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nLet me consider the system:\n\nx/p + y/q =1,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1.\n\nExpress q from the first equation:\n\nq = 1/(x/p -1/p).\n\nWait, no, let me solve for q:\n\ny/q = 1 - x/p => q = y / (1 - x/p).\n\nBut that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let me express q in terms of p:\n\nFrom the first equation, x/p + y/q =1 => y/q =1 - x/p => q = y / (1 - x/p).\n\nBut since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1, substitute q:\n\np\u00b2 + [ y / (1 - x/p) ]^2 =1.\n\nLet me write 1 - x/p as (p -x)/p.\n\nSo, q = y / [ (p -x)/p ] = y p / (p -x).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + [ y p / (p -x) ]^2 =1.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\np\u00b2 + (y\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(p -x)^2 =1.\n\nMultiply both sides by (p -x)^2:\n\np\u00b2 (p -x)^2 + y\u00b2 p\u00b2 = (p -x)^2.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy, but maybe I can factor p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [ (p -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ] = (p -x)^2.\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 = (p -x)^2 / [ (p -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ].\n\nHmm, perhaps cross-multiplying:\n\np\u00b2 [ (p -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ] = (p -x)^2.\n\nThis is a quartic equation in p, which seems difficult to solve.\n\nBut perhaps I can consider that for point C, this equation has a double root at p=1/2, which corresponds to AB. So, when p=1/2, we have a solution, and perhaps it's a double root, meaning the equation and its derivative are zero at p=1/2.\n\nSo, let me substitute p=1/2 into the equation:\n\n( (1/2)^2 ) [ (1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 ] = (1/2 -x)^2.\n\nCompute left side:\n\n(1/4)[ (1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 ].\n\nRight side:\n\n(1/2 -x)^2.\n\nSo, setting equal:\n\n(1/4)[ (1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 ] = (1/2 -x)^2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n(1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 = 4 (1/2 -x)^2.\n\nSimplify:\n\ny^2 = 4 (1/2 -x)^2 - (1/2 -x)^2 = 3 (1/2 -x)^2.\n\nSo,\n\ny^2 = 3 (1/2 -x)^2.\n\nBut since y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, let's substitute that:\n\n[ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^2 = 3 (1/2 -x)^2.\n\nCompute left side:\n\n( sqrt(3) ( -x + 1/2 ) )^2 = 3 ( -x +1/2 )^2.\n\nRight side: 3 (1/2 -x)^2.\n\nSo, both sides are equal. So, this condition holds for any point on AB. Hmm, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should take the derivative of the equation p\u00b2 [ (p -x)^2 + y^2 ] = (p -x)^2 with respect to p, and evaluate it at p=1/2, and set it to zero because it's a double root.\n\nLet me denote F(p) = p\u00b2 [ (p -x)^2 + y^2 ] - (p -x)^2.\n\nWe have F(p)=0, and F'(p)=0 at p=1/2.\n\nSo, compute F'(p):\n\nF'(p) = 2p [ (p -x)^2 + y^2 ] + p\u00b2 [ 2(p -x) ] - 2(p -x).\n\nEvaluate at p=1/2:\n\nF'(1/2) = 2*(1/2)*[ (1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 ] + (1/2)^2 * 2*(1/2 -x) - 2*(1/2 -x).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (1)*[ (1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 ].\n\nSecond term: (1/4)*2*(1/2 -x) = (1/2)(1/2 -x).\n\nThird term: -2*(1/2 -x).\n\nSo, F'(1/2) = [ (1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 ] + (1/2)(1/2 -x) - 2*(1/2 -x).\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ (1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 ] + (1/2)(1/2 -x) - (4/2)(1/2 -x).\n\n= [ (1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 ] + (1/2 -x)(1/2 -4).\n\n= [ (1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 ] + (1/2 -x)(-7/2).\n\nSet F'(1/2) =0:\n\n(1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 - (7/2)(1/2 -x) =0.\n\nNow, substitute y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into this equation.\n\nSo, compute y^2:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\ny^2 = 3x^2 - 2*(sqrt(3)x)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (3/4) = 3x^2 - 3x + 3/4.\n\nNow, substitute into the equation:\n\n(1/2 -x)^2 + (3x^2 -3x +3/4) - (7/2)(1/2 -x) =0.\n\nExpand (1/2 -x)^2:\n\n= 1/4 -x + x^2.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1/4 -x +x^2) + (3x^2 -3x +3/4) - (7/2)(1/2 -x) =0.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n1/4 -x +x^2 +3x^2 -3x +3/4 - (7/2)(1/2) + (7/2)x =0.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n1/4 +3/4 =1.\n\n-x -3x = -4x.\n\nx^2 +3x^2=4x^2.\n\nNow, the other terms:\n\n- (7/2)(1/2) = -7/4.\n\n+ (7/2)x.\n\nSo, combining all terms:\n\n1 -4x +4x^2 -7/4 + (7/2)x =0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1 -7/4 = -3/4.\n\n-4x + (7/2)x = (-8/2 +7/2)x = (-1/2)x.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n4x^2 - (1/2)x -3/4=0.\n\nMultiply all terms by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n\n16x^2 -2x -3=0.\n\nNow, solve for x using quadratic formula:\n\nx = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 + 4*16*3)]/(2*16).\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\nsqrt(4 + 192) = sqrt(196) =14.\n\nSo,\n\nx = [2 \u00b114]/32.\n\nSo,\n\nx = (16)/32=1/2,\n\nor x = (-12)/32= -3/8.\n\nBut x is between 0 and 1/2 on AB, so x=1/2 is point A, which we are to exclude, so the other solution is x=-3/8, which is negative, so not on AB. Hmm, that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, when expanding (1/2 -x)^2, it's (x -1/2)^2 = x^2 -x +1/4.\n\nWait, wait, (1/2 -x)^2 is x^2 -x +1/4, correct.\n\nThen, adding y^2=3x^2 -3x +3/4.\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n(x^2 -x +1/4) + (3x^2 -3x +3/4) =4x^2 -4x +1.\n\nThen, subtracting (7/2)(1/2 -x):\n\n= 4x^2 -4x +1 - (7/2)(1/2 -x).\n\nCompute (7/2)(1/2 -x) =7/4 - (7/2)x.\n\nSo,\n\n4x^2 -4x +1 -7/4 + (7/2)x =0.\n\nCombine constants: 1 -7/4= -3/4.\n\nCombine x terms: -4x + (7/2)x = (-8/2 +7/2)x= (-1/2)x.\n\nSo, equation is:\n\n4x^2 - (1/2)x -3/4=0.\n\nMultiply by 4: 16x^2 -2x -3=0.\n\nSolutions:\n\nx = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 + 192)]/(32) = [2 \u00b114]/32.\n\nSo, x=16/32=1/2, and x=-12/32=-3/8.\n\nHmm, but both solutions are outside the range of x on AB, which is from 0 to1/2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider that the derivative condition gives x=1/2, which is point A, but we need another point where the equation has a double root, which would be another solution. But perhaps the only solution is x=1/2, which is point A, which we are supposed to exclude.\n\nHmm, maybe I took the wrong approach by considering the tangent condition. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that for point C, the equation x/p + y/q =1 has exactly one solution (p, q) on the unit circle, which is AB itself. So, perhaps I can set up the system and find that the only solution is p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize AB as a line segment and find the point C where the only segment from F passing through C is AB.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that for point C, the line AB is the only line from F that passes through C. So, any other line from F would not pass through C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is the point where all other lines from F would \"miss\" C, except AB.\n\nHmm, maybe I can consider that for point C, the equation x/p + y/q =1 has exactly one solution (p, q) on the unit circle, which is AB.\n\nLet me try to write this system:\n\nx/p + y/q =1,\n\np^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nLet me solve for q from the first equation:\n\nq = 1/(x/p -1).\n\nWait, no, let me rearrange the first equation:\n\ny/q = 1 - x/p => q = y / (1 - x/p).\n\nBut then, substitute into p^2 + q^2 =1:\n\np^2 + [ y / (1 - x/p) ]^2 =1.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\np^2 + y^2 / (1 - x/p)^2 =1.\n\nLet me let t = p, so:\n\nt^2 + y^2 / (1 - x/t)^2 =1.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by t^2:\n\nt^2 + y^2 t^2 / (t -x)^2 =1.\n\nSo,\n\nt^2 [ 1 + y^2 / (t -x)^2 ] =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be rewritten as:\n\nt^2 ( (t -x)^2 + y^2 ) / (t -x)^2 =1.\n\nSo,\n\nt^2 [ (t -x)^2 + y^2 ] = (t -x)^2.\n\nThis is the same as before.\n\nNow, to find the point C on AB such that this equation has only one solution t=p, which is t=1/2.\n\nSo, the equation must have a double root at t=1/2, meaning that (t -1/2)^2 is a factor.\n\nSo, perhaps I can write the equation as (t -1/2)^2 * something =0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can perform polynomial division.\n\nLet me write the equation as:\n\nt^2 [ (t -x)^2 + y^2 ] - (t -x)^2 =0.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nt^2 (t^2 -2x t +x^2 + y^2 ) - (t^2 -2x t +x^2 )=0.\n\nMultiply out:\n\nt^4 -2x t^3 + (x^2 + y^2) t^2 - t^2 +2x t -x^2 =0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nt^4 -2x t^3 + (x^2 + y^2 -1) t^2 +2x t -x^2 =0.\n\nNow, since we want a double root at t=1/2, the polynomial should be divisible by (t -1/2)^2.\n\nSo, let me perform polynomial division or use the factor theorem.\n\nLet me denote the polynomial as P(t) = t^4 -2x t^3 + (x^2 + y^2 -1) t^2 +2x t -x^2.\n\nIf (t -1/2)^2 is a factor, then P(1/2)=0 and P\u2019(1/2)=0.\n\nCompute P(1/2):\n\n(1/2)^4 -2x (1/2)^3 + (x^2 + y^2 -1)(1/2)^2 +2x (1/2) -x^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/16) -2x*(1/8) + (x^2 + y^2 -1)*(1/4) +x -x^2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/16 - (x/4) + (x^2 + y^2 -1)/4 +x -x^2.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1/16 + [ -x/4 + x ] + [ (x^2 + y^2 -1)/4 -x^2 ].\n\nSimplify each part:\n\n-x/4 +x = (3x)/4.\n\n(x^2 + y^2 -1)/4 -x^2 = (x^2 + y^2 -1 -4x^2)/4 = (-3x^2 + y^2 -1)/4.\n\nSo, overall:\n\n1/16 + (3x)/4 + (-3x^2 + y^2 -1)/4 =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:\n\n1 + 12x + (-3x^2 + y^2 -1)*4 =0.\n\nExpand:\n\n1 +12x + (-12x^2 +4y^2 -4) =0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1 -4 +12x -12x^2 +4y^2=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n-3 +12x -12x^2 +4y^2=0.\n\nDivide by common factor 4:\n\n-3/4 +3x -3x^2 +y^2=0.\n\nNow, since point C lies on AB, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, y^2 = 3x^2 -3x +3/4.\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\n-3/4 +3x -3x^2 + (3x^2 -3x +3/4)=0.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n-3/4 +3x -3x^2 +3x^2 -3x +3/4=0.\n\nEverything cancels out:\n\n(-3/4 +3/4) + (3x -3x) + (-3x^2 +3x^2)=0.\n\nSo, 0=0, which is always true. So, P(1/2)=0 holds for any point on AB.\n\nNow, compute the derivative P\u2019(t):\n\nP\u2019(t) =4t^3 -6x t^2 + 2(x^2 + y^2 -1)t +2x.\n\nEvaluate at t=1/2:\n\nP\u2019(1/2)=4*(1/2)^3 -6x*(1/2)^2 + 2(x^2 + y^2 -1)*(1/2) +2x.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4*(1/8)=0.5,\n\n-6x*(1/4)= -1.5x,\n\n2*(x^2 + y^2 -1)*(1/2)= (x^2 + y^2 -1),\n\n+2x.\n\nSo, P\u2019(1/2)=0.5 -1.5x +x^2 + y^2 -1 +2x.\n\nSimplify:\n\n0.5 -1 + (-1.5x +2x) +x^2 + y^2.\n\n= -0.5 +0.5x +x^2 + y^2.\n\nSet equal to zero:\n\n-0.5 +0.5x +x^2 + y^2=0.\n\nAgain, since y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, y^2=3x^2 -3x +3/4.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n-0.5 +0.5x +x^2 +3x^2 -3x +3/4=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-0.5 + 3/4) + (0.5x -3x) + (x^2 +3x^2).\n\n= (0.5) + (-2.5x) +4x^2=0.\n\nSo,\n\n4x^2 -2.5x +0.5=0.\n\nMultiply all terms by 2 to eliminate decimals:\n\n8x^2 -5x +1=0.\n\nSolve using quadratic formula:\n\nx = [5 \u00b1sqrt(25 -32)]/(16).\n\nWait, discriminant is 25 -32= -7, which is negative. So, no real solutions.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. It suggests that there is no such point C on AB, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in calculating the derivative.\n\nWait, let me recompute P\u2019(t):\n\nP(t)=t^4 -2x t^3 + (x^2 + y^2 -1) t^2 +2x t -x^2.\n\nSo, P\u2019(t)=4t^3 -6x t^2 + 2(x^2 + y^2 -1) t +2x.\n\nEvaluate at t=1/2:\n\n4*(1/2)^3 =4*(1/8)=0.5,\n\n-6x*(1/2)^2=-6x*(1/4)= -1.5x,\n\n2*(x^2 + y^2 -1)*(1/2)= (x^2 + y^2 -1),\n\n+2x.\n\nSo, sum is:\n\n0.5 -1.5x + (x^2 + y^2 -1) +2x.\n\n=0.5 -1 + (-1.5x +2x) +x^2 + y^2.\n\n= -0.5 +0.5x +x^2 + y^2.\n\nSet to zero:\n\nx^2 + y^2 +0.5x -0.5=0.\n\nNow, substitute y^2=3x^2 -3x +3/4:\n\nx^2 +3x^2 -3x +3/4 +0.5x -0.5=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4x^2 -2.5x +0.5=0.\n\nSame as before, which has no real solutions.\n\nHmm, this suggests that there's no such point C, which contradicts the problem statement. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the point C is the midpoint of AB, but I don't think that's necessarily the case.\n\nWait, AB has endpoints at (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). The midpoint would be at (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). Let me compute OC^2: (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 =1/16 +3/16=4/16=1/4. But the problem states that OC^2 is p/q, which would be 1/4, so p+q=5. But I don't know if this is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but the problem says that C is on AB, not equal to A or B, and that it's the unique point that doesn't belong to any other segment from F except AB. So, perhaps the midpoint is that point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the point C is the point where the line AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F.\n\nWait, the envelope of the family F might be a curve that is tangent to each member of F. So, perhaps the point C lies on this envelope, making it the only point on AB that lies on the envelope, hence only on AB from F.\n\nThe envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q =1, with p^2 + q^2=1, can be found using the method of solving for the envelope.\n\nThe envelope satisfies both the equation of the line and the derivative condition.\n\nSo, the envelope equations are:\n\nx/p + y/q =1,\n\nand the derivative with respect to a parameter (say, \u03b8) is zero.\n\nWait, perhaps I can parametrize p and q using \u03b8, as before: p=cos\u03b8, q=sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, the line equation becomes x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nThe envelope is found by solving:\n\nx/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1,\n\nand d/d\u03b8 (x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 -1 )=0.\n\nCompute the derivative:\n\nd/d\u03b8 (x/cos\u03b8) = x sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nd/d\u03b8 (y/sin\u03b8) = -y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nso the derivative is:\n\nx sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 - y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo,\n\nx sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 = y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nwhich can be written as:\n\nx sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n(x/y) = (cos^3\u03b8)/(sin^3\u03b8) = (cot\u03b8)^3.\n\nSo,\n\ncot\u03b8 = (x/y)^{1/3}.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as tan\u03b8 = (y/x)^{1/3}.\n\nSo, tan\u03b8 = (y/x)^{1/3}.\n\nNow, from the line equation:\n\nx/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nExpress cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8 in terms of tan\u03b8.\n\nLet me set t = tan\u03b8, so sin\u03b8 = t / sqrt(1 +t^2), cos\u03b8=1/sqrt(1 +t^2).\n\nSo, substituting into the line equation:\n\nx * sqrt(1 +t^2)/t + y * sqrt(1 +t^2)/1 =1.\n\nFactor sqrt(1 +t^2):\n\nsqrt(1 +t^2) [x/t + y] =1.\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate sqrt:\n\n(1 +t^2) [x/t + y]^2 =1.\n\nExpand [x/t + y]^2:\n\n= x^2/t^2 + 2xy/t + y^2.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 +t^2)(x^2/t^2 + 2xy/t + y^2 )=1.\n\nMultiply through:\n\n(x^2/t^2 + 2xy/t + y^2 ) + (x^2 + 2xy t + y^2 t^2 )=1.\n\nMultiply terms:\n\nx^2/t^2 + 2xy/t + y^2 +x^2 + 2xy t + y^2 t^2 =1.\n\nMultiply all terms by t^2 to eliminate denominators:\n\nx^2 + 2xy t + y^2 t^2 +x^2 t^2 + 2xy t^3 + y^2 t^4 = t^2.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\ny^2 t^4 + (2xy +x^2) t^2 + x^2 + 2xy t + y^2 t^2 -t^2=0.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding.\n\nWait, let me try again:\n\nAfter multiplying by t^2:\n\nx^2 + 2xy t + y^2 t^2 +x^2 t^2 + 2xy t^3 + y^2 t^4 = t^2.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\ny^2 t^4 + (x^2 + 2xy) t^2 + x^2 + 2xy t + (x^2 + y^2 -1) t^2 =0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to collect like terms:\n\nt^4 y^2 + t^3 (2xy) + t^2 (x^2 + 2xy +x^2 + y^2 ) + t*(2xy) +x^2 - t^2=0.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting tangled up. Alternatively, perhaps I can substitute t = (y/x)^{1/3} as found earlier.\n\nSo, t^3 = y/x.\n\nSo, let me set t = (y/x)^{1/3}, so t^3 = y/x.\n\nNow, substitute into the equation:\n\ny^2 t^4 + 2xy t^3 + (x^2 + y^2) t^2 + 2xy t +x^2 -t^2=0.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I can instead consider that the envelope is a curve, and find its equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the method of solving for the envelope.\n\nGiven the family of lines f(\u03b8) = x cos\u03b8 + y sin\u03b8 - cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 =0.\n\nWait, because the line equation x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1 can be rewritten as x cos\u03b8 + y sin\u03b8 = cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, f(\u03b8)=x cos\u03b8 + y sin\u03b8 - cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8=0.\n\nThe envelope is found by solving f(\u03b8)=0 and df/d\u03b8=0.\n\nCompute df/d\u03b8:\n\ndf/d\u03b8 = -x sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 - (sin^2\u03b8 - cos^2\u03b8).\n\nSet to zero:\n\n-x sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 - (sin^2\u03b8 - cos^2\u03b8)=0.\n\nSo, the envelope is the solution to:\n\nx cos\u03b8 + y sin\u03b8 = cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8,\n\nand\n\n-x sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 = sin^2\u03b8 - cos^2\u03b8.\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps I can solve for x and y.\n\nLet me write the two equations as:\n\n1. x cos\u03b8 + y sin\u03b8 = cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8,\n\n2. -x sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 = sin^2\u03b8 - cos^2\u03b8.\n\nLet me write this as a system:\n\n[ cos\u03b8   sin\u03b8 ] [x]   = [ cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 ]\n\n[ -sin\u03b8  cos\u03b8 ] [y]     [ sin^2\u03b8 - cos^2\u03b8 ]\n\nThis can be written as a matrix equation M [x;

But I don't have the envelope's equation yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the point C where AB is tangent to the envelope, making C the only point of intersection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize AB and substitute into the envelope's parametric equations.\n\nLet me parametrize AB as follows:\n\nLet me let x = (1/2)(1 - s),\n\ny = sqrt(3)/2 * s,\n\nwhere s ranges from 0 to1.\n\nAt s=0, x=1/2, y=0 (point A).\n\nAt s=1, x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2 (point B).\n\nSo, substituting into the envelope's parametric equations:\n\nx = t (2 - t^2)/(1 + t^2)^{3/2} = (1/2)(1 - s),\n\ny = (2t^2 -1)/(1 + t^2)^{3/2} = sqrt(3)/2 * s.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can solve for t in terms of s.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find s such that these equations hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the point C is the point where the line AB is tangent to the envelope, which would give a unique solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use geometry to find point C.\n\nWait, another approach: The family F consists of all segments PQ of length 1 with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis. The point C is on AB, and the only segment from F that passes through C is AB itself. So, for any other segment PQ in F, it doesn't pass through C.\n\nSo, for point C, the equation x/p + y/q =1 has no solution (p, q) other than (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSo, the system:\n\nx/p + y/q =1,\n\np^2 + q^2 =1,\n\nhas only one solution, which is p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nThus, substituting x and y from AB into the system, we can find C.\n\nWait, but for any point on AB, the system has at least one solution (p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2). We need the system to have exactly one solution.\n\nSo, to find C, we can set up the condition that the system has only one solution, which is when the line x/p + y/q=1 is tangent to the unit circle p^2 + q^2=1.\n\nWait, earlier I thought this condition leads to x^2 + y^2=1, but that can't be right because AB is inside the unit circle.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the condition for the line a p + b q = c to be tangent to the circle p^2 + q^2 = r^2 is |c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = r.\n\nIn our case, the line is x p + y q = p q.\n\nWait, no, the line equation is x/p + y/q =1, which can be written as x q + y p = p q.\n\nSo, the line equation is x q + y p = p q.\n\nRearranged as x q + y p - p q=0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as p (y - q) + q x =0.\n\nNot sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write it as p (y - q) + q x =0.\n\nBut maybe I can think of this as a linear equation in p and q.\n\nThe condition for this line to be tangent to the unit circle p^2 + q^2=1 is that the distance from the origin to the line is equal to 1.\n\nThe distance from (0,0) to the line a p + b q + c=0 is |c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2).\n\nIn our case, the line equation is x q + y p - p q=0.\n\nWait, perhaps I can rearrange it:\n\nx q + y p = p q.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nx q + y p - p q =0.\n\nFactor p and q:\n\np(y - q) + q x =0.\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write it as:\n\np (y - q) + q x =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can treat this as a linear equation in p and q, and compute the distance from the origin.\n\nThe standard form is A p + B q + C =0.\n\nIn our case, the equation is x q + y p - p q=0.\n\nWait, perhaps I can rearrange it as:\n\n(y) p + (x) q - p q =0.\n\nHmm, but this isn't linear in p and q because of the p q term.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me try a different method.\n\nLet me consider that for point C on AB, the equation x/p + y/q =1 has exactly one solution (p, q) on the unit circle.\n\nSo, substituting y from AB into the equation:\n\nx/p + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] / q =1,\n\nwith p^2 + q^2=1.\n\nLet me denote u = p, v = q.\n\nSo, the system becomes:\n\nx/u + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] / v =1,\n\nu^2 + v^2=1.\n\nI can write this as:\n\nx v + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] u = u v.\n\nRearranged:\n\nx v + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] u - u v =0.\n\nFactor u:\n\nu [ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) - v ] +x v=0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can solve for v in terms of u.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can treat this as a linear equation in u and v.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n[ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) - v ] u +x v=0.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as:\n\n[ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) ] u + (x - u) v=0.\n\nThis is a linear equation in u and v.\n\nThe condition for this line to be tangent to the unit circle u^2 +v^2=1 is that the distance from the origin to the line is 1.\n\nThe standard form is A u + B v + C =0.\n\nIn our case, the equation is:\n\n[ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) ] u + (x - u) v=0.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the rearrangement.\n\nWait, the equation after substitution is:\n\nx v + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] u = u v.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nx v + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] u - u v=0.\n\nFactor u:\n\nu [ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) - v ] +x v=0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as:\n\nu [ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 - v ) ] +x v=0.\n\nThis is a linear equation in u and v: A u + B v + C=0, where A = (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 -v ), B =x, C=0.\n\nWait, but v is a variable here, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as:\n\n[ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) ] u +x v -u v=0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor terms differently.\n\nLet me consider that this equation is linear in u and v, so the condition for tangency is that the distance from the origin to the line is 1.\n\nThe distance from (0,0) to A u + B v + C=0 is |C| / sqrt(A^2 + B^2).\n\nIn our case, the equation is:\n\n[ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) ] u +x v = u v.\n\nHmm, but this includes a u v term, which makes it nonlinear.\n\nHmm, this seems too complicated. Maybe I should consider that the point C is where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.\n\nThe envelope of F is the set of points where each point is on exactly one member of F, which is tangent to that member.\n\nSo, if AB is tangent to the envelope at point C, then C is the only point on AB that lies on the envelope, hence only on AB from F.\n\nSo, perhaps I can find the point C where AB is tangent to the envelope.\n\nBut I don't have the equation of the envelope yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the envelope and find where it intersects AB.\n\nFrom earlier, the parametric equations of the envelope are:\n\nx = t (2 - t^2)/(1 + t^2)^{3/2},\n\ny = (2t^2 -1)/(1 + t^2)^{3/2}.\n\nSo, to find where AB intersects the envelope, set y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n(2t^2 -1)/(1 + t^2)^{3/2} = -sqrt(3) [ t (2 -t^2) ]/(1 + t^2)^{3/2} + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 +t^2)^{3/2}:\n\n2t^2 -1 = -sqrt(3) t (2 -t^2) + sqrt(3)/2 (1 +t^2)^{3/2}.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated to solve analytically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that the point C is where AB is tangent to the envelope, leading to a single solution for t.\n\nBut this might require more advanced techniques.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the point C is the foot of the perpendicular from O to AB, but I don't think that's necessarily the case.\n\nWait, the foot of the perpendicular from O to AB is the point closest to O on AB, which is at distance sqrt(3)/4 from O, as computed earlier.\n\nBut perhaps that's not the point C we're looking for.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the condition that for point C, the equation x/p + y/q=1 has exactly one solution (p, q) on the unit circle, which is AB itself.\n\nSo, substituting y from AB into the equation:\n\nx/p + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] / q =1,\n\nwith p^2 + q^2=1.\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\nx/p + [ sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) ] / q =1.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nx/p + sqrt(3)(1/2 -x)/q =1.\n\nLet me denote k =1/2 -x, so:\n\nx/p + sqrt(3)k /q =1.\n\nBut k =1/2 -x, so x=1/2 -k.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n(1/2 -k)/p + sqrt(3)k /q =1.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as:\n\nx q + sqrt(3)k p = p q,\n\nwhere k=1/2 -x.\n\nSo,\n\nx q + sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) p = p q.\n\nRearranged:\n\nx q + sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) p -p q =0.\n\nFactor p:\n\np [ sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) - q ] +x q =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can solve for q in terms of p.\n\nLet me write:\n\np [ sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) - q ] = -x q.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 -x) p - p q = -x q.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 -x) p + q (x - p )=0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can solve for q:\n\nq (x - p )= - sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) p.\n\nSo,\n\nq= [ - sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) p ] / (x - p ).\n\nBut since p^2 + q^2=1, substitute q:\n\np^2 + [ (- sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) p ) / (x - p ) ]^2 =1.\n\nThis is a complicated equation, but perhaps I can find x such that this equation has exactly one solution p, which is p=1/2.\n\nSo, substituting p=1/2:\n\n(1/2)^2 + [ (- sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) * (1/2) ) / (x -1/2) ]^2 =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/4 + [ (- sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) *1/2 ) / (x -1/2) ]^2 =1.\n\nNote that (x -1/2)= -(1/2 -x), so:\n\n=1/4 + [ (- sqrt(3)(1/2 -x)*1/2 ) / ( - (1/2 -x) ) ]^2.\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n= [ (- sqrt(3)(1/2 -x)*1/2 ) / ( - (1/2 -x) ) ]\n\n= [ (sqrt(3)(1/2 -x)*1/2 ) / (1/2 -x) ) ]\n\n= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n1/4 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 =1.\n\nCompute:\n\n1/4 + 3/4=1, which holds.\n\nSo, p=1/2 is a solution for any x on AB. Now, we want that this is the only solution. So, the equation should have exactly one solution p=1/2.\n\nThus, the equation:\n\np^2 + [ (- sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) p ) / (x - p ) ]^2 =1,\n\nmust have exactly one solution p=1/2.\n\nSo, let me denote this equation as:\n\np^2 + [ (- sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) p ) / (x - p ) ]^2 =1.\n\nLet me denote t = p, so:\n\nt^2 + [ (- sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) t ) / (x - t ) ]^2 =1.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nt^2 + [ (sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) t ) / (t -x ) ]^2 =1.\n\nLet me compute this expression:\n\n= t^2 + [ sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) t / (t -x) ]^2.\n\nLet me factor out (1/2 -x)^2:\n\n= t^2 + 3 (1/2 -x)^2 t^2 / (t -x)^2.\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= t^2 [ 1 + 3 (1/2 -x)^2 / (t -x)^2 ].\n\nSet equal to 1:\n\nt^2 [ 1 + 3 (1/2 -x)^2 / (t -x)^2 ] =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can cross-multiply:\n\nt^2 (t -x)^2 + 3 (1/2 -x)^2 t^2 = (t -x)^2.\n\nLet me expand t^2 (t -x)^2:\n\n= t^2 (t^2 - 2x t +x^2).\n\n= t^4 -2x t^3 +x^2 t^2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nt^4 -2x t^3 +x^2 t^2 +3 (1/2 -x)^2 t^2 = t^2 -2x t +x^2.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nt^4 -2x t^3 +x^2 t^2 +3 (1/2 -x)^2 t^2 - t^2 +2x t -x^2=0.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nt^4 -2x t^3 + [x^2 +3(1/2 -x)^2 -1] t^2 +2x t -x^2=0.\n\nCompute the coefficient of t^2:\n\nx^2 +3*(1/4 -x +x^2) -1 =x^2 +3/4 -3x +3x^2 -1=4x^2 -3x -1/4.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nt^4 -2x t^3 + (4x^2 -3x -1/4) t^2 +2x t -x^2=0.\n\nWe know that t=1/2 is a root, so let's perform polynomial division to factor (t -1/2).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nDivide t^4 -2x t^3 + (4x^2 -3x -1/4) t^2 +2x t -x^2 by (t -1/2).\n\nSet up coefficients:\n\n1 | -2x | 4x^2 -3x -1/4 | 2x | -x^2.\n\nUsing t=1/2:\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: 1*(1/2)=1/2.\n\nAdd to next coefficient: -2x +1/2.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: (-2x +1/2)*(1/2)= -x +1/4.\n\nAdd to next coefficient:4x^2 -3x -1/4 + (-x +1/4)=4x^2 -4x.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: (4x^2 -4x)*(1/2)=2x^2 -2x.\n\nAdd to next coefficient:2x + (2x^2 -2x)=2x^2.\n\nMultiply by 1/2:2x^2*(1/2)=x^2.\n\nAdd to last coefficient: -x^2 +x^2=0.\n\nSo, the quotient polynomial is:\n\nt^3 + (-2x +1/2) t^2 + (4x^2 -4x) t +2x^2.\n\nSo, the equation factors as:\n\n(t -1/2)(t^3 + (-2x +1/2) t^2 + (4x^2 -4x) t +2x^2 )=0.\n\nNow, we want that the only solution is t=1/2, so the cubic must have no real roots other than t=1/2.\n\nBut for a cubic, it must have at least one real root. So, perhaps the cubic has a double root at t=1/2, making t=1/2 a triple root.\n\nSo, let's check if t=1/2 is a root of the cubic:\n\nEvaluate the cubic at t=1/2:\n\n(1/2)^3 + (-2x +1/2)(1/2)^2 + (4x^2 -4x)(1/2) +2x^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1/8 + (-2x +1/2)(1/4) + (4x^2 -4x)(1/2) +2x^2.\n\n=1/8 + (-2x/4 +1/8) + (2x^2 -2x) +2x^2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/8 -x/2 +1/8 +2x^2 -2x +2x^2.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(1/8 +1/8) + (-x/2 -2x) + (2x^2 +2x^2).\n\n= 1/4 - (5x/2) +4x^2.\n\nSet equal to zero:\n\n4x^2 - (5x/2) +1/4=0.\n\nMultiply by 4 to eliminate fractions:\n\n16x^2 -10x +1=0.\n\nSolve using quadratic formula:\n\nx = [10 \u00b1sqrt(100 -64)]/32 = [10 \u00b16]/32.\n\nSo,\n\nx=(16)/32=1/2,\n\nor x=(4)/32=1/8.\n\nSo, when x=1/2, t=1/2 is a root of the cubic, which makes sense because it's a root of the original equation. When x=1/8, t=1/2 is also a root.\n\nSo, for x=1/8, the cubic has a double root at t=1/2, making the original equation have a triple root at t=1/2.\n\nThus, the point C is at x=1/8 on AB.\n\nSo, substituting x=1/8 into AB's equation:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8 +4 sqrt(3)/8 )=3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nThus, OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 =1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nSo, p=7, q=16, and p+q=23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{23}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. \n\nWe have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere up the y-axis. I think sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, so it's a bit less than (0,1). \n\nThen, there's this family F of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant. Each segment PQ has P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, for each such segment, P is (p,0) and Q is (0,q) where p and q are positive real numbers, and the distance between P and Q is 1. \n\nI need to find a point C on segment AB, not equal to A or B, such that C is not on any other segment from F except for AB itself. And then find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. The answer will be a fraction p/q, and I need to find p + q.\n\nHmm. So, first, maybe I should parameterize the segments in F. Each segment PQ has P at (p,0) and Q at (0,q), with sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1. So, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, all these segments are of length 1, lying in the first quadrant with endpoints on the axes.\n\nEach such segment PQ can be described by the equation (x/p) + (y/q) = 1, right? Because it's a line connecting (p,0) to (0,q). So, the intercept form of the line is x/p + y/q = 1.\n\nSo, the family F consists of all lines x/p + y/q = 1 where p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nNow, the point C is on AB, so I should parametrize AB first. Let's find the equation of AB.\n\nPoints A and B are (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the line AB can be found using the two-point form. The slope m is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Plugging in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nNow, the problem says that C is on AB, and it's the unique point on AB (other than A and B) that is not on any other segment from F except for AB itself. So, I think this means that C is the point where all the other segments PQ from F would not pass through C, except for AB. So, in other words, AB is the only segment in F that passes through C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is such that it's the only point on AB that is not intersected by any other segment from F. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, another way: For each point C on AB (other than A and B), we can see if there's another segment PQ in F that also passes through C. If C is unique in the sense that only AB passes through it, then that's our point.\n\nSo, to find such a C, we can set up the condition that there exists a unique pair (p, q) such that the line x/p + y/q = 1 passes through C, and that this is only possible when p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2, which corresponds to the segment AB itself.\n\nSo, suppose C is (x, y), lying on AB, so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nFor C to lie on a segment PQ, which is x/p + y/q =1, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. So, substituting C into the line equation: x/p + y/q =1.\n\nBut since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, we can express q in terms of p or vice versa. Let me try to write this equation:\n\nx/p + y/q =1. But since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, perhaps we can find a relationship between p and q.\n\nLet me express q in terms of p. From p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2). But since q is positive (as Q is on the positive y-axis), we can write q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2).\n\nWait, but then the equation becomes x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) =1.\n\nNow, since C is on AB, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Let's substitute that into the equation:\n\nx/p + [(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)] / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) =1.\n\nThis equation is in terms of x and p. But for C to lie on AB and on some PQ from F, this equation must hold for some p.\n\nBut we want that C is only on AB and no other PQ, so we want that for all other p (other than p=1/2, which gives us AB itself), this equation does not hold. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting it wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the point C is such that when we substitute it into the equation x/p + y/q =1, the only solution is p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2, which corresponds to AB.\n\nSo, to find such a C, we can set up the equation such that there is exactly one solution (p, q) satisfying both x/p + y/q =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, which is the case when the system has only one solution, which is p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWait, but maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps for other points C on AB, there exists another PQ in F that also passes through C. So, we need to find the point C where this isn't possible; that is, no other PQ in F passes through C except AB.\n\nSo, perhaps C is such that the system x/p + y/q =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 has exactly one solution (p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2). So, to ensure that, the equation x/p + y/q =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 must have only that solution. So, we can think of this as a system of equations in p and q, and set the condition that it has only one solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parameterize p and q. Let me think. Let me denote p = cos\u03b8 and q = sin\u03b8, since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. So, \u03b8 is an angle parameterizing the possible points P and Q on the axes.\n\nSo, then the line equation becomes x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) =1. So, for a point C(x, y) to lie on this line, it must satisfy x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) =1.\n\nBut since C is on AB, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Substituting that into the line equation:\n\nx/(cos\u03b8) + [(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)] / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\nx/(cos\u03b8) - (sqrt(3)x)/sin\u03b8 + (sqrt(3)/2)/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nCombine the terms with x:\n\nx [1/cos\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/sin\u03b8] + (sqrt(3)/2)/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\nx * [ (sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8) / (sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8) ) ] + (sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8)) = 1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as:\n\nx * [ (sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8) / (sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8) ) ] = 1 - sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8).\n\nLet me denote numerator as N = sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8.\n\nDenominator as D = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nx * (N / D) = 1 - sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8).\n\nMultiply both sides by D:\n\nx * N = [1 - sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8)] * D.\n\nBut D = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8, so:\n\nx * N = [1 - sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8)] * sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side:\n\n= [1 * sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8] - [sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8) * sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8]\n\n= sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 - (sqrt(3)/2) cos\u03b8\n\n= cos\u03b8 (sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nx * N = cos\u03b8 (sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nBut N = sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8, so:\n\nx (sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8) = cos\u03b8 (sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nHmm, let's write this as:\n\nx sin\u03b8 - x sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 = cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 - (sqrt(3)/2) cos\u03b8.\n\nLet me bring all terms to the left:\n\nx sin\u03b8 - x sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 - cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 + (sqrt(3)/2) cos\u03b8 = 0.\n\nFactor terms:\n\nsin\u03b8 (x - cos\u03b8) + cos\u03b8 (-x sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)/2 ) = 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor sqrt(3):\n\nsin\u03b8 (x - cos\u03b8) + sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ( (-x + 1/2 ) ) =0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let's group terms differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I can collect terms with sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8:\n\nsin\u03b8 (x - cos\u03b8) + cos\u03b8 ( -x sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)/2 ) = 0.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nsin\u03b8 (x - cos\u03b8) + cos\u03b8 [ sqrt(3) ( 1/2 - x ) ] = 0.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor out something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor cos\u03b8:\n\n= cos\u03b8 [ sqrt(3) (1/2 - x) ] + sin\u03b8 (x - cos\u03b8) = 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write this as:\n\ncos\u03b8 [ sqrt(3)(1/2 - x) ] + sin\u03b8 (x - cos\u03b8) =0.\n\nHmm, maybe I can express this as a linear combination of sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8. Let's see:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nA sin\u03b8 + B cos\u03b8 = 0,\n\nwhere A = x - cos\u03b8,\n\nand B = sqrt(3)(1/2 - x).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because in the equation, we have:\n\ncos\u03b8 * [ sqrt(3)(1/2 - x) ] + sin\u03b8 * (x - cos\u03b8) =0.\n\nSo, that would be:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 - x) cos\u03b8 + (x - cos\u03b8) sin\u03b8 = 0.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n[ sqrt(3)(1/2 - x) ] cos\u03b8 + [x - cos\u03b8 ] sin\u03b8 = 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor this differently. Let's see:\n\nLet me expand the terms:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 - x) cos\u03b8 + x sin\u03b8 - cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 =0.\n\nHmm, maybe grouping terms:\n\n= [ sqrt(3)(1/2 - x) - sin\u03b8 ] cos\u03b8 + x sin\u03b8 =0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can rearrange terms:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 - x) cos\u03b8 - cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 + x sin\u03b8 =0.\n\n= cos\u03b8 [ sqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) - sin\u03b8 ] + x sin\u03b8 =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's getting somewhere.\n\nLet me denote:\n\ncos\u03b8 [ sqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) - sin\u03b8 ] + x sin\u03b8 =0.\n\nLet me factor out sqrt(3)(1/2 -x ):\n\n= sqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) cos\u03b8 - cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 + x sin\u03b8 =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8 terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) cos\u03b8 = cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 - x sin\u03b8.\n\nFactor sin\u03b8 on the right:\n\n= sin\u03b8 ( cos\u03b8 - x ).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 ( cos\u03b8 - x ).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 ( cos\u03b8 - x ).\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 (x - cos\u03b8 ) =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor something out. Let me see:\n\nLet me take (1/2 -x ) as a term:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 (x - cos\u03b8 ) =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor (1/2 -x ) and x terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write this as:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + x sin\u03b8 =0.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8 terms:\n\n= [ sqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) - sin\u03b8 ] cos\u03b8 + x sin\u03b8 =0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider this as a linear equation in terms of cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8. Let me denote the equation as:\n\nA cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 =0,\n\nwhere A = sqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) - sin\u03b8,\n\nand B = x.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because A would depend on sin\u03b8, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write this as:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) cos\u03b8 + x sin\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can move everything to one side:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) cos\u03b8 + x sin\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 =0.\n\nFactor terms:\n\n= cos\u03b8 [ sqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) - sin\u03b8 ] + x sin\u03b8 =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that for each C on AB, the equation x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) =1 has a solution \u03b8, except for a particular C where it only has \u03b8 corresponding to AB.\n\nWait, but AB itself is PQ with P at (1/2, 0) and Q at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, for AB, p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2, and indeed (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 =1, so that's correct.\n\nSo, for AB, \u03b8 is such that cos\u03b8 =1/2 and sin\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2, which is \u03b8=60 degrees or \u03c0/3 radians.\n\nSo, perhaps for other points C on AB, there exists another \u03b8 that also satisfies the equation.\n\nBut we want the point C where this equation has only one solution for \u03b8, which is \u03b8=\u03c0/3. So, for that point C, the system x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1 has only one solution, which is \u03b8=\u03c0/3.\n\nHmm, so maybe I can consider the equation x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) =1, along with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1, which is cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8=1.\n\nBut since x and y are fixed for a particular point C, we can think of this equation as a constraint on \u03b8.\n\nSo, maybe I can write x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) =1, and we can find \u03b8 that satisfies this.\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\nx/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) =1.\n\nLet me denote t = tan(\u03b8/2). Then, using the identities cos\u03b8 = (1 - t\u00b2)/(1 + t\u00b2), sin\u03b8 = 2t/(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n\nx * (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) + y * (1 + t\u00b2)/(2t) =1.\n\nHmm, this substitution might complicate things, but perhaps it can lead to a quadratic equation in t, which would have exactly one solution when the discriminant is zero. So, maybe for point C, the equation in t would have exactly one solution, meaning that \u03b8 is uniquely determined, which is the case when AB passes through C.\n\nWait, but actually, we want that for C, the equation in t has only one solution, which would correspond to \u03b8=\u03c0/3, and no other \u03b8. So, perhaps the discriminant of the quadratic equation in t would be zero, leading to a unique solution.\n\nLet me try to write this substitution.\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\nx/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) =1.\n\nExpressed in terms of t, where t = tan(\u03b8/2):\n\ncos\u03b8 = (1 - t\u00b2)/(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2t/(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nx * (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) + y * (1 + t\u00b2)/(2t) =1.\n\nLet me factor out (1 + t\u00b2):\n\n(1 + t\u00b2) [ x/(1 - t\u00b2) + y/(2t) ] =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as:\n\n(1 + t\u00b2) [ (2x t + y (1 - t\u00b2)) / (2t (1 - t\u00b2)) ) ] =1.\n\nWait, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire equation as:\n\nx/( (1 - t\u00b2)/(1 + t\u00b2) ) + y/( (2t)/(1 + t\u00b2) ) =1.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx * (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) + y * (1 + t\u00b2)/(2t) =1.\n\nLet me factor out (1 + t\u00b2):\n\n(1 + t\u00b2) [ x/(1 - t\u00b2) + y/(2t) ] =1.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n(1 + t\u00b2) [ (2x t + y (1 - t\u00b2)) / (2t (1 - t\u00b2)) ) ] =1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to just multiply both sides by 2t(1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2) to eliminate denominators.\n\nSo, multiply both sides by 2t(1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2):\n\n2t(1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2) * [x/(1 - t\u00b2) + y/(2t)] = 2t(1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2) *1.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: 2t(1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2) * x/(1 - t\u00b2) = 2t(1 + t\u00b2) x.\n\nSecond term: 2t(1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2) * y/(2t) = (1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2) y.\n\nSo, left side becomes:\n\n2t(1 + t\u00b2)x + (1 - t^4)y = 2t(1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nWait, 1 - t^4 is (1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2), so that term is (1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2) y.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n2t(1 + t\u00b2)x + (1 - t^4) y = 2t(1 - t^4).\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side:\n\n2t(1 + t\u00b2)x + (1 - t^4) y - 2t(1 - t^4) =0.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should plug in y from AB's equation.\n\nSince C is on AB, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substitute y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into the equation:\n\n2t(1 + t\u00b2)x + (1 - t^4)(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) - 2t(1 - t^4) =0.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n2t(1 + t\u00b2)x - sqrt(3)(1 - t^4)x + (sqrt(3)/2)(1 - t^4) - 2t(1 - t^4) =0.\n\nLet me collect like terms:\n\nx [2t(1 + t\u00b2) - sqrt(3)(1 - t^4)] + [ (sqrt(3)/2)(1 - t^4) - 2t(1 - t^4) ] =0.\n\nFactor out (1 - t^4) from the second bracket:\n\n= x [2t(1 + t\u00b2) - sqrt(3)(1 - t^4)] + (1 - t^4)[ sqrt(3)/2 - 2t ] =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor (1 - t^4) as (1 - t\u00b2)(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nBut this might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can set this as a quadratic equation in t.\n\nLet me try to expand the terms:\n\nFirst term: 2t(1 + t\u00b2)x = 2t x + 2t^3 x.\n\nSecond term: -sqrt(3)(1 - t^4)x = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)x t^4.\n\nThird term: sqrt(3)/2 (1 - t^4) = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/2 t^4.\n\nFourth term: -2t(1 - t^4) = -2t + 2t^5.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n2t x + 2t^3 x - sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)x t^4 + sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/2 t^4 -2t + 2t^5 = 0.\n\nNow, let me collect like terms by powers of t:\n\nt^5: 2x t^5.\n\nt^4: sqrt(3)x t^4 - sqrt(3)/2 t^4.\n\nt^3: 2x t^3.\n\nt^2: None.\n\nt: 2x t -2t.\n\nConstants: -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n2x t^5 + [ sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2 ] t^4 + 2x t^3 + (2x -2) t + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) =0.\n\nHmm, this is a quintic equation, which is difficult to solve in general. Maybe I can consider that for the point C where only AB passes through it, the equation has a double root at t corresponding to \u03b8=\u03c0/3.\n\nWait, because if AB is the only segment from F passing through C, then the equation would have a repeated root at t corresponding to \u03b8=\u03c0/3, meaning that the polynomial and its derivative would both be zero at that t.\n\nSo, perhaps I can substitute t = tan(\u03c0/6) because \u03b8=\u03c0/3, so \u03b8/2=\u03c0/6, so tan(\u03c0/6)=1/sqrt(3).\n\nLet me let t0 = 1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo, substituting t = t0 into the equation:\n\n2x t0^5 + [ sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2 ] t0^4 + 2x t0^3 + (2x -2) t0 + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) =0.\n\nAnd also, the derivative of the polynomial with respect to t evaluated at t0 should be zero.\n\nBut this might get very complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for the point C, the equation in t has a double root at t0=1/sqrt(3), so I can set up equations based on that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better approach.\n\nLet me think again. The family of lines is x/p + y/q =1, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1. The point C is on AB, so it's (x, y)= (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2).\n\nWe want that for this point C, the equation x/p + y/q =1 has exactly one solution (p, q) satisfying p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1, which is the case for AB.\n\nSo, to ensure that, when we solve the system x/p + y/q =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1, we get exactly one solution, which would be when the two equations are dependent, i.e., when the line x/p + y/q=1 is tangent to the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1.\n\nWait, that might be a better way to think about it. The condition that the line x/p + y/q=1 is tangent to the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1.\n\nSo, the condition for a line a p + b q = c to be tangent to the unit circle is |c| / sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) =1. So, in this case, the line is x p + y q = p q, since x/p + y/q =1 can be written as x p + y q = p q.\n\nWait, let me check that: x/p + y/q =1 => (x q + y p)/(p q) =1 => x q + y p = p q.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's the right way. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the line equation as x p + y q = p q.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think of it differently.\n\nWait, the line is x/p + y/q =1. Let me rearrange it as (x/p) + (y/q) -1=0. So, in terms of variables p and q, it's a linear equation. The condition that this line is tangent to the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1 is that the distance from the center (0,0) to the line is equal to 1.\n\nWait, but the distance from (0,0) to the line (x/p) + (y/q) -1=0 is |0 + 0 -1| / sqrt( (x/p)^2 + (y/q)^2 ). Wait, no, the standard formula is |Ax + By + C| / sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), where the line is Ax + By + C=0.\n\nWait, but in this case, the line is (x/p) p + (y/q) q -1=0? Wait, no, the line equation is (x/p) + (y/q) =1, which can be written as (x/p) + (y/q) -1 =0. So, in standard form, it's (x/p) p + (y/q) q -1 =0, which doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rearrangement. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the line equation is (x/p) + (y/q) =1. To express this in standard form, it's (x/p) + (y/q) -1 =0. So, the coefficients are A = 1/p, B = 1/q, and C = -1.\n\nSo, the distance from the origin (0,0) to this line is |A*0 + B*0 + C| / sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2) = |C| / sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2) = | -1 | / sqrt( (1/p)^2 + (1/q)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt( (1/p^2) + (1/q^2) ).\n\nFor the line to be tangent to the unit circle p^2 + q^2 =1, this distance must be equal to the radius of the circle, which is 1. So,\n\n1 / sqrt( (1/p^2) + (1/q^2) ) =1.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( (1/p^2) + (1/q^2) ) =1.\n\nSquaring both sides,\n\n1/p^2 + 1/q^2 =1.\n\nBut since p^2 + q^2 =1, we can write:\n\n1/p^2 + 1/q^2 = (p^2 + q^2)/(p^2 q^2) =1/(p^2 q^2) =1.\n\nSo,\n\n1/(p^2 q^2) =1 => p^2 q^2 =1.\n\nBut since p^2 + q^2=1, and p^2 q^2=1, let me see if that's possible.\n\nWait, p^2 + q^2=1 and p^2 q^2=1.\n\nLet me denote a = p^2, b = q^2.\n\nSo,\n\na + b =1,\n\na b =1.\n\nThen, the quadratic equation is t^2 - t +1=0, whose discriminant is 1 -4 = -3 <0.\n\nSo, there are no real solutions. Hmm, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the condition. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the line equation is (x/p) + (y/q) =1, and we want it to be tangent to the unit circle p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nThe condition for a line a p + b q = c to be tangent to the circle p^2 + q^2 = r^2 is |c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = r.\n\nIn our case, the line is (x/p) + (y/q) =1, which can be rewritten as (x) p^{-1} + (y) q^{-1} =1. So, in terms of a p + b q = c, a = x/p, b = y/q, c=1.\n\nWait, no, perhaps that's not the correct way. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the line equation is (x/p) + (y/q) =1. Let me express this as (x)(1/p) + (y)(1/q) =1.\n\nSo, in the standard form a p + b q = c, where p and q are variables, a = x, b = y, c =1.\n\nWait, but p and q are variables in the circle equation p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nSo, the line equation is a p + b q = c, where a = x, b = y, c =1.\n\nThen, the condition for this line to be tangent to the circle p^2 + q^2 =1 is |c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2) =1.\n\nSo,\n\n|1| / sqrt(x^2 + y^2) =1,\n\nwhich implies sqrt(x^2 + y^2) =1,\n\nso x^2 + y^2 =1.\n\nBut wait, that's the equation of a unit circle. So, the condition is that the point (x, y) lies on the unit circle.\n\nBut in our problem, point C is on AB, which is a line from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). The distance from O to AB is the length of the perpendicular from O to AB.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the distance from O to AB. The line AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nThe distance from (0,0) to this line is |0 + 0 - sqrt(3)/2| / sqrt( (sqrt(3))^2 +1^2 ) )= (sqrt(3)/2) / sqrt(4) )= (sqrt(3)/2) / 2 = sqrt(3)/4 \u22480.433.\n\nWhich is less than 1, so the point C lies inside the unit circle.\n\nWait, but according to the condition, if x^2 + y^2 =1, then the line x/p + y/q=1 is tangent to the unit circle p^2 + q^2=1.\n\nBut in our problem, the point C is (x, y) on AB, so unless C lies on the unit circle, the condition won't hold. But our point C is on AB, which is a line from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is at a distance of sqrt(3)/4 from O, so it's inside the unit circle.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried to compute the condition, I ended up with p^2 q^2 =1, which has no real solutions, which suggests that the line can't be tangent to the unit circle unless p and q are complex, which they aren't because they are on the axes in the first quadrant.\n\nHmm, so perhaps my approach is incorrect. Maybe I should try a different method.\n\nLet me think again. For point C on AB, the equation x/p + y/q =1 must have exactly one solution (p, q) on the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1. That solution is AB itself, so p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe need that for any other (p, q) on the unit circle, the line x/p + y/q =1 does not pass through C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is such that when we solve for p and q, the only solution is p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nLet me consider the system:\n\nx/p + y/q =1,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1.\n\nExpress q from the first equation:\n\nq = 1/(x/p -1/p).\n\nWait, no, let me solve for q:\n\ny/q = 1 - x/p => q = y / (1 - x/p).\n\nBut that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let me express q in terms of p:\n\nFrom the first equation, x/p + y/q =1 => y/q =1 - x/p => q = y / (1 - x/p).\n\nBut since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1, substitute q:\n\np\u00b2 + [ y / (1 - x/p) ]^2 =1.\n\nLet me write 1 - x/p as (p -x)/p.\n\nSo, q = y / [ (p -x)/p ] = y p / (p -x).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + [ y p / (p -x) ]^2 =1.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\np\u00b2 + (y\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(p -x)^2 =1.\n\nMultiply both sides by (p -x)^2:\n\np\u00b2 (p -x)^2 + y\u00b2 p\u00b2 = (p -x)^2.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy, but maybe I can factor p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [ (p -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ] = (p -x)^2.\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 = (p -x)^2 / [ (p -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ].\n\nHmm, perhaps cross-multiplying:\n\np\u00b2 [ (p -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ] = (p -x)^2.\n\nThis is a quartic equation in p, which seems difficult to solve.\n\nBut perhaps I can consider that for point C, this equation has a double root at p=1/2, which corresponds to AB. So, when p=1/2, we have a solution, and perhaps it's a double root, meaning the equation and its derivative are zero at p=1/2.\n\nSo, let me substitute p=1/2 into the equation:\n\n( (1/2)^2 ) [ (1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 ] = (1/2 -x)^2.\n\nCompute left side:\n\n(1/4)[ (1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 ].\n\nRight side:\n\n(1/2 -x)^2.\n\nSo, setting equal:\n\n(1/4)[ (1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 ] = (1/2 -x)^2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n(1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 = 4 (1/2 -x)^2.\n\nSimplify:\n\ny^2 = 4 (1/2 -x)^2 - (1/2 -x)^2 = 3 (1/2 -x)^2.\n\nSo,\n\ny^2 = 3 (1/2 -x)^2.\n\nBut since y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, let's substitute that:\n\n[ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^2 = 3 (1/2 -x)^2.\n\nCompute left side:\n\n( sqrt(3) ( -x + 1/2 ) )^2 = 3 ( -x +1/2 )^2.\n\nRight side: 3 (1/2 -x)^2.\n\nSo, both sides are equal. So, this condition holds for any point on AB. Hmm, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should take the derivative of the equation p\u00b2 [ (p -x)^2 + y^2 ] = (p -x)^2 with respect to p, and evaluate it at p=1/2, and set it to zero because it's a double root.\n\nLet me denote F(p) = p\u00b2 [ (p -x)^2 + y^2 ] - (p -x)^2.\n\nWe have F(p)=0, and F'(p)=0 at p=1/2.\n\nSo, compute F'(p):\n\nF'(p) = 2p [ (p -x)^2 + y^2 ] + p\u00b2 [ 2(p -x) ] - 2(p -x).\n\nEvaluate at p=1/2:\n\nF'(1/2) = 2*(1/2)*[ (1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 ] + (1/2)^2 * 2*(1/2 -x) - 2*(1/2 -x).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (1)*[ (1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 ].\n\nSecond term: (1/4)*2*(1/2 -x) = (1/2)(1/2 -x).\n\nThird term: -2*(1/2 -x).\n\nSo, F'(1/2) = [ (1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 ] + (1/2)(1/2 -x) - 2*(1/2 -x).\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ (1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 ] + (1/2)(1/2 -x) - (4/2)(1/2 -x).\n\n= [ (1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 ] + (1/2 -x)(1/2 -4).\n\n= [ (1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 ] + (1/2 -x)(-7/2).\n\nSet F'(1/2) =0:\n\n(1/2 -x)^2 + y^2 - (7/2)(1/2 -x) =0.\n\nNow, substitute y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into this equation.\n\nSo, compute y^2:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\ny^2 = 3x^2 - 2*(sqrt(3)x)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (3/4) = 3x^2 - 3x + 3/4.\n\nNow, substitute into the equation:\n\n(1/2 -x)^2 + (3x^2 -3x +3/4) - (7/2)(1/2 -x) =0.\n\nExpand (1/2 -x)^2:\n\n= 1/4 -x + x^2.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1/4 -x +x^2) + (3x^2 -3x +3/4) - (7/2)(1/2 -x) =0.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n1/4 -x +x^2 +3x^2 -3x +3/4 - (7/2)(1/2) + (7/2)x =0.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n1/4 +3/4 =1.\n\n-x -3x = -4x.\n\nx^2 +3x^2=4x^2.\n\nNow, the other terms:\n\n- (7/2)(1/2) = -7/4.\n\n+ (7/2)x.\n\nSo, combining all terms:\n\n1 -4x +4x^2 -7/4 + (7/2)x =0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1 -7/4 = -3/4.\n\n-4x + (7/2)x = (-8/2 +7/2)x = (-1/2)x.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n4x^2 - (1/2)x -3/4=0.\n\nMultiply all terms by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n\n16x^2 -2x -3=0.\n\nNow, solve for x using quadratic formula:\n\nx = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 + 4*16*3)]/(2*16).\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\nsqrt(4 + 192) = sqrt(196) =14.\n\nSo,\n\nx = [2 \u00b114]/32.\n\nSo,\n\nx = (16)/32=1/2,\n\nor x = (-12)/32= -3/8.\n\nBut x is between 0 and 1/2 on AB, so x=1/2 is point A, which we are to exclude, so the other solution is x=-3/8, which is negative, so not on AB. Hmm, that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, when expanding (1/2 -x)^2, it's (x -1/2)^2 = x^2 -x +1/4.\n\nWait, wait, (1/2 -x)^2 is x^2 -x +1/4, correct.\n\nThen, adding y^2=3x^2 -3x +3/4.\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n(x^2 -x +1/4) + (3x^2 -3x +3/4) =4x^2 -4x +1.\n\nThen, subtracting (7/2)(1/2 -x):\n\n= 4x^2 -4x +1 - (7/2)(1/2 -x).\n\nCompute (7/2)(1/2 -x) =7/4 - (7/2)x.\n\nSo,\n\n4x^2 -4x +1 -7/4 + (7/2)x =0.\n\nCombine constants: 1 -7/4= -3/4.\n\nCombine x terms: -4x + (7/2)x = (-8/2 +7/2)x= (-1/2)x.\n\nSo, equation is:\n\n4x^2 - (1/2)x -3/4=0.\n\nMultiply by 4: 16x^2 -2x -3=0.\n\nSolutions:\n\nx = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 + 192)]/(32) = [2 \u00b114]/32.\n\nSo, x=16/32=1/2, and x=-12/32=-3/8.\n\nHmm, but both solutions are outside the range of x on AB, which is from 0 to1/2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider that the derivative condition gives x=1/2, which is point A, but we need another point where the equation has a double root, which would be another solution. But perhaps the only solution is x=1/2, which is point A, which we are supposed to exclude.\n\nHmm, maybe I took the wrong approach by considering the tangent condition. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that for point C, the equation x/p + y/q =1 has exactly one solution (p, q) on the unit circle, which is AB itself. So, perhaps I can set up the system and find that the only solution is p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize AB as a line segment and find the point C where the only segment from F passing through C is AB.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that for point C, the line AB is the only line from F that passes through C. So, any other line from F would not pass through C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is the point where all other lines from F would \"miss\" C, except AB.\n\nHmm, maybe I can consider that for point C, the equation x/p + y/q =1 has exactly one solution (p, q) on the unit circle, which is AB.\n\nLet me try to write this system:\n\nx/p + y/q =1,\n\np^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nLet me solve for q from the first equation:\n\nq = 1/(x/p -1).\n\nWait, no, let me rearrange the first equation:\n\ny/q = 1 - x/p => q = y / (1 - x/p).\n\nBut then, substitute into p^2 + q^2 =1:\n\np^2 + [ y / (1 - x/p) ]^2 =1.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\np^2 + y^2 / (1 - x/p)^2 =1.\n\nLet me let t = p, so:\n\nt^2 + y^2 / (1 - x/t)^2 =1.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by t^2:\n\nt^2 + y^2 t^2 / (t -x)^2 =1.\n\nSo,\n\nt^2 [ 1 + y^2 / (t -x)^2 ] =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be rewritten as:\n\nt^2 ( (t -x)^2 + y^2 ) / (t -x)^2 =1.\n\nSo,\n\nt^2 [ (t -x)^2 + y^2 ] = (t -x)^2.\n\nThis is the same as before.\n\nNow, to find the point C on AB such that this equation has only one solution t=p, which is t=1/2.\n\nSo, the equation must have a double root at t=1/2, meaning that (t -1/2)^2 is a factor.\n\nSo, perhaps I can write the equation as (t -1/2)^2 * something =0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can perform polynomial division.\n\nLet me write the equation as:\n\nt^2 [ (t -x)^2 + y^2 ] - (t -x)^2 =0.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nt^2 (t^2 -2x t +x^2 + y^2 ) - (t^2 -2x t +x^2 )=0.\n\nMultiply out:\n\nt^4 -2x t^3 + (x^2 + y^2) t^2 - t^2 +2x t -x^2 =0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nt^4 -2x t^3 + (x^2 + y^2 -1) t^2 +2x t -x^2 =0.\n\nNow, since we want a double root at t=1/2, the polynomial should be divisible by (t -1/2)^2.\n\nSo, let me perform polynomial division or use the factor theorem.\n\nLet me denote the polynomial as P(t) = t^4 -2x t^3 + (x^2 + y^2 -1) t^2 +2x t -x^2.\n\nIf (t -1/2)^2 is a factor, then P(1/2)=0 and P\u2019(1/2)=0.\n\nCompute P(1/2):\n\n(1/2)^4 -2x (1/2)^3 + (x^2 + y^2 -1)(1/2)^2 +2x (1/2) -x^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/16) -2x*(1/8) + (x^2 + y^2 -1)*(1/4) +x -x^2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/16 - (x/4) + (x^2 + y^2 -1)/4 +x -x^2.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1/16 + [ -x/4 + x ] + [ (x^2 + y^2 -1)/4 -x^2 ].\n\nSimplify each part:\n\n-x/4 +x = (3x)/4.\n\n(x^2 + y^2 -1)/4 -x^2 = (x^2 + y^2 -1 -4x^2)/4 = (-3x^2 + y^2 -1)/4.\n\nSo, overall:\n\n1/16 + (3x)/4 + (-3x^2 + y^2 -1)/4 =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:\n\n1 + 12x + (-3x^2 + y^2 -1)*4 =0.\n\nExpand:\n\n1 +12x + (-12x^2 +4y^2 -4) =0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1 -4 +12x -12x^2 +4y^2=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n-3 +12x -12x^2 +4y^2=0.\n\nDivide by common factor 4:\n\n-3/4 +3x -3x^2 +y^2=0.\n\nNow, since point C lies on AB, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, y^2 = 3x^2 -3x +3/4.\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\n-3/4 +3x -3x^2 + (3x^2 -3x +3/4)=0.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n-3/4 +3x -3x^2 +3x^2 -3x +3/4=0.\n\nEverything cancels out:\n\n(-3/4 +3/4) + (3x -3x) + (-3x^2 +3x^2)=0.\n\nSo, 0=0, which is always true. So, P(1/2)=0 holds for any point on AB.\n\nNow, compute the derivative P\u2019(t):\n\nP\u2019(t) =4t^3 -6x t^2 + 2(x^2 + y^2 -1)t +2x.\n\nEvaluate at t=1/2:\n\nP\u2019(1/2)=4*(1/2)^3 -6x*(1/2)^2 + 2(x^2 + y^2 -1)*(1/2) +2x.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4*(1/8)=0.5,\n\n-6x*(1/4)= -1.5x,\n\n2*(x^2 + y^2 -1)*(1/2)= (x^2 + y^2 -1),\n\n+2x.\n\nSo, P\u2019(1/2)=0.5 -1.5x +x^2 + y^2 -1 +2x.\n\nSimplify:\n\n0.5 -1 + (-1.5x +2x) +x^2 + y^2.\n\n= -0.5 +0.5x +x^2 + y^2.\n\nSet equal to zero:\n\n-0.5 +0.5x +x^2 + y^2=0.\n\nAgain, since y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, y^2=3x^2 -3x +3/4.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n-0.5 +0.5x +x^2 +3x^2 -3x +3/4=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-0.5 + 3/4) + (0.5x -3x) + (x^2 +3x^2).\n\n= (0.5) + (-2.5x) +4x^2=0.\n\nSo,\n\n4x^2 -2.5x +0.5=0.\n\nMultiply all terms by 2 to eliminate decimals:\n\n8x^2 -5x +1=0.\n\nSolve using quadratic formula:\n\nx = [5 \u00b1sqrt(25 -32)]/(16).\n\nWait, discriminant is 25 -32= -7, which is negative. So, no real solutions.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. It suggests that there is no such point C on AB, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in calculating the derivative.\n\nWait, let me recompute P\u2019(t):\n\nP(t)=t^4 -2x t^3 + (x^2 + y^2 -1) t^2 +2x t -x^2.\n\nSo, P\u2019(t)=4t^3 -6x t^2 + 2(x^2 + y^2 -1) t +2x.\n\nEvaluate at t=1/2:\n\n4*(1/2)^3 =4*(1/8)=0.5,\n\n-6x*(1/2)^2=-6x*(1/4)= -1.5x,\n\n2*(x^2 + y^2 -1)*(1/2)= (x^2 + y^2 -1),\n\n+2x.\n\nSo, sum is:\n\n0.5 -1.5x + (x^2 + y^2 -1) +2x.\n\n=0.5 -1 + (-1.5x +2x) +x^2 + y^2.\n\n= -0.5 +0.5x +x^2 + y^2.\n\nSet to zero:\n\nx^2 + y^2 +0.5x -0.5=0.\n\nNow, substitute y^2=3x^2 -3x +3/4:\n\nx^2 +3x^2 -3x +3/4 +0.5x -0.5=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4x^2 -2.5x +0.5=0.\n\nSame as before, which has no real solutions.\n\nHmm, this suggests that there's no such point C, which contradicts the problem statement. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the point C is the midpoint of AB, but I don't think that's necessarily the case.\n\nWait, AB has endpoints at (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). The midpoint would be at (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). Let me compute OC^2: (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 =1/16 +3/16=4/16=1/4. But the problem states that OC^2 is p/q, which would be 1/4, so p+q=5. But I don't know if this is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but the problem says that C is on AB, not equal to A or B, and that it's the unique point that doesn't belong to any other segment from F except AB. So, perhaps the midpoint is that point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the point C is the point where the line AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F.\n\nWait, the envelope of the family F might be a curve that is tangent to each member of F. So, perhaps the point C lies on this envelope, making it the only point on AB that lies on the envelope, hence only on AB from F.\n\nThe envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q =1, with p^2 + q^2=1, can be found using the method of solving for the envelope.\n\nThe envelope satisfies both the equation of the line and the derivative condition.\n\nSo, the envelope equations are:\n\nx/p + y/q =1,\n\nand the derivative with respect to a parameter (say, \u03b8) is zero.\n\nWait, perhaps I can parametrize p and q using \u03b8, as before: p=cos\u03b8, q=sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, the line equation becomes x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nThe envelope is found by solving:\n\nx/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1,\n\nand d/d\u03b8 (x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 -1 )=0.\n\nCompute the derivative:\n\nd/d\u03b8 (x/cos\u03b8) = x sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nd/d\u03b8 (y/sin\u03b8) = -y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nso the derivative is:\n\nx sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 - y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo,\n\nx sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 = y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nwhich can be written as:\n\nx sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n(x/y) = (cos^3\u03b8)/(sin^3\u03b8) = (cot\u03b8)^3.\n\nSo,\n\ncot\u03b8 = (x/y)^{1/3}.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as tan\u03b8 = (y/x)^{1/3}.\n\nSo, tan\u03b8 = (y/x)^{1/3}.\n\nNow, from the line equation:\n\nx/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nExpress cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8 in terms of tan\u03b8.\n\nLet me set t = tan\u03b8, so sin\u03b8 = t / sqrt(1 +t^2), cos\u03b8=1/sqrt(1 +t^2).\n\nSo, substituting into the line equation:\n\nx * sqrt(1 +t^2)/t + y * sqrt(1 +t^2)/1 =1.\n\nFactor sqrt(1 +t^2):\n\nsqrt(1 +t^2) [x/t + y] =1.\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate sqrt:\n\n(1 +t^2) [x/t + y]^2 =1.\n\nExpand [x/t + y]^2:\n\n= x^2/t^2 + 2xy/t + y^2.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 +t^2)(x^2/t^2 + 2xy/t + y^2 )=1.\n\nMultiply through:\n\n(x^2/t^2 + 2xy/t + y^2 ) + (x^2 + 2xy t + y^2 t^2 )=1.\n\nMultiply terms:\n\nx^2/t^2 + 2xy/t + y^2 +x^2 + 2xy t + y^2 t^2 =1.\n\nMultiply all terms by t^2 to eliminate denominators:\n\nx^2 + 2xy t + y^2 t^2 +x^2 t^2 + 2xy t^3 + y^2 t^4 = t^2.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\ny^2 t^4 + (2xy +x^2) t^2 + x^2 + 2xy t + y^2 t^2 -t^2=0.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding.\n\nWait, let me try again:\n\nAfter multiplying by t^2:\n\nx^2 + 2xy t + y^2 t^2 +x^2 t^2 + 2xy t^3 + y^2 t^4 = t^2.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\ny^2 t^4 + (x^2 + 2xy) t^2 + x^2 + 2xy t + (x^2 + y^2 -1) t^2 =0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to collect like terms:\n\nt^4 y^2 + t^3 (2xy) + t^2 (x^2 + 2xy +x^2 + y^2 ) + t*(2xy) +x^2 - t^2=0.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting tangled up. Alternatively, perhaps I can substitute t = (y/x)^{1/3} as found earlier.\n\nSo, t^3 = y/x.\n\nSo, let me set t = (y/x)^{1/3}, so t^3 = y/x.\n\nNow, substitute into the equation:\n\ny^2 t^4 + 2xy t^3 + (x^2 + y^2) t^2 + 2xy t +x^2 -t^2=0.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I can instead consider that the envelope is a curve, and find its equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the method of solving for the envelope.\n\nGiven the family of lines f(\u03b8) = x cos\u03b8 + y sin\u03b8 - cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 =0.\n\nWait, because the line equation x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1 can be rewritten as x cos\u03b8 + y sin\u03b8 = cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, f(\u03b8)=x cos\u03b8 + y sin\u03b8 - cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8=0.\n\nThe envelope is found by solving f(\u03b8)=0 and df/d\u03b8=0.\n\nCompute df/d\u03b8:\n\ndf/d\u03b8 = -x sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 - (sin^2\u03b8 - cos^2\u03b8).\n\nSet to zero:\n\n-x sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 - (sin^2\u03b8 - cos^2\u03b8)=0.\n\nSo, the envelope is the solution to:\n\nx cos\u03b8 + y sin\u03b8 = cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8,\n\nand\n\n-x sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 = sin^2\u03b8 - cos^2\u03b8.\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps I can solve for x and y.\n\nLet me write the two equations as:\n\n1. x cos\u03b8 + y sin\u03b8 = cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8,\n\n2. -x sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 = sin^2\u03b8 - cos^2\u03b8.\n\nLet me write this as a system:\n\n[ cos\u03b8   sin\u03b8 ] [x]   = [ cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 ]\n\n[ -sin\u03b8  cos\u03b8 ] [y]     [ sin^2\u03b8 - cos^2\u03b8 ]\n\nThis can be written as a matrix equation M [x;

But I don't have the envelope's equation yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the point C where AB is tangent to the envelope, making C the only point of intersection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize AB and substitute into the envelope's parametric equations.\n\nLet me parametrize AB as follows:\n\nLet me let x = (1/2)(1 - s),\n\ny = sqrt(3)/2 * s,\n\nwhere s ranges from 0 to1.\n\nAt s=0, x=1/2, y=0 (point A).\n\nAt s=1, x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2 (point B).\n\nSo, substituting into the envelope's parametric equations:\n\nx = t (2 - t^2)/(1 + t^2)^{3/2} = (1/2)(1 - s),\n\ny = (2t^2 -1)/(1 + t^2)^{3/2} = sqrt(3)/2 * s.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can solve for t in terms of s.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find s such that these equations hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the point C is the point where the line AB is tangent to the envelope, which would give a unique solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use geometry to find point C.\n\nWait, another approach: The family F consists of all segments PQ of length 1 with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis. The point C is on AB, and the only segment from F that passes through C is AB itself. So, for any other segment PQ in F, it doesn't pass through C.\n\nSo, for point C, the equation x/p + y/q =1 has no solution (p, q) other than (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSo, the system:\n\nx/p + y/q =1,\n\np^2 + q^2 =1,\n\nhas only one solution, which is p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nThus, substituting x and y from AB into the system, we can find C.\n\nWait, but for any point on AB, the system has at least one solution (p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2). We need the system to have exactly one solution.\n\nSo, to find C, we can set up the condition that the system has only one solution, which is when the line x/p + y/q=1 is tangent to the unit circle p^2 + q^2=1.\n\nWait, earlier I thought this condition leads to x^2 + y^2=1, but that can't be right because AB is inside the unit circle.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the condition for the line a p + b q = c to be tangent to the circle p^2 + q^2 = r^2 is |c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = r.\n\nIn our case, the line is x p + y q = p q.\n\nWait, no, the line equation is x/p + y/q =1, which can be written as x q + y p = p q.\n\nSo, the line equation is x q + y p = p q.\n\nRearranged as x q + y p - p q=0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as p (y - q) + q x =0.\n\nNot sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write it as p (y - q) + q x =0.\n\nBut maybe I can think of this as a linear equation in p and q.\n\nThe condition for this line to be tangent to the unit circle p^2 + q^2=1 is that the distance from the origin to the line is equal to 1.\n\nThe distance from (0,0) to the line a p + b q + c=0 is |c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2).\n\nIn our case, the line equation is x q + y p - p q=0.\n\nWait, perhaps I can rearrange it:\n\nx q + y p = p q.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nx q + y p - p q =0.\n\nFactor p and q:\n\np(y - q) + q x =0.\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write it as:\n\np (y - q) + q x =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can treat this as a linear equation in p and q, and compute the distance from the origin.\n\nThe standard form is A p + B q + C =0.\n\nIn our case, the equation is x q + y p - p q=0.\n\nWait, perhaps I can rearrange it as:\n\n(y) p + (x) q - p q =0.\n\nHmm, but this isn't linear in p and q because of the p q term.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me try a different method.\n\nLet me consider that for point C on AB, the equation x/p + y/q =1 has exactly one solution (p, q) on the unit circle.\n\nSo, substituting y from AB into the equation:\n\nx/p + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] / q =1,\n\nwith p^2 + q^2=1.\n\nLet me denote u = p, v = q.\n\nSo, the system becomes:\n\nx/u + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] / v =1,\n\nu^2 + v^2=1.\n\nI can write this as:\n\nx v + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] u = u v.\n\nRearranged:\n\nx v + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] u - u v =0.\n\nFactor u:\n\nu [ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) - v ] +x v=0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can solve for v in terms of u.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can treat this as a linear equation in u and v.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n[ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) - v ] u +x v=0.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as:\n\n[ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) ] u + (x - u) v=0.\n\nThis is a linear equation in u and v.\n\nThe condition for this line to be tangent to the unit circle u^2 +v^2=1 is that the distance from the origin to the line is 1.\n\nThe standard form is A u + B v + C =0.\n\nIn our case, the equation is:\n\n[ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) ] u + (x - u) v=0.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the rearrangement.\n\nWait, the equation after substitution is:\n\nx v + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] u = u v.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nx v + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] u - u v=0.\n\nFactor u:\n\nu [ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) - v ] +x v=0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as:\n\nu [ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 - v ) ] +x v=0.\n\nThis is a linear equation in u and v: A u + B v + C=0, where A = (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 -v ), B =x, C=0.\n\nWait, but v is a variable here, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as:\n\n[ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) ] u +x v -u v=0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor terms differently.\n\nLet me consider that this equation is linear in u and v, so the condition for tangency is that the distance from the origin to the line is 1.\n\nThe distance from (0,0) to A u + B v + C=0 is |C| / sqrt(A^2 + B^2).\n\nIn our case, the equation is:\n\n[ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) ] u +x v = u v.\n\nHmm, but this includes a u v term, which makes it nonlinear.\n\nHmm, this seems too complicated. Maybe I should consider that the point C is where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.\n\nThe envelope of F is the set of points where each point is on exactly one member of F, which is tangent to that member.\n\nSo, if AB is tangent to the envelope at point C, then C is the only point on AB that lies on the envelope, hence only on AB from F.\n\nSo, perhaps I can find the point C where AB is tangent to the envelope.\n\nBut I don't have the equation of the envelope yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the envelope and find where it intersects AB.\n\nFrom earlier, the parametric equations of the envelope are:\n\nx = t (2 - t^2)/(1 + t^2)^{3/2},\n\ny = (2t^2 -1)/(1 + t^2)^{3/2}.\n\nSo, to find where AB intersects the envelope, set y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n(2t^2 -1)/(1 + t^2)^{3/2} = -sqrt(3) [ t (2 -t^2) ]/(1 + t^2)^{3/2} + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 +t^2)^{3/2}:\n\n2t^2 -1 = -sqrt(3) t (2 -t^2) + sqrt(3)/2 (1 +t^2)^{3/2}.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated to solve analytically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that the point C is where AB is tangent to the envelope, leading to a single solution for t.\n\nBut this might require more advanced techniques.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the point C is the foot of the perpendicular from O to AB, but I don't think that's necessarily the case.\n\nWait, the foot of the perpendicular from O to AB is the point closest to O on AB, which is at distance sqrt(3)/4 from O, as computed earlier.\n\nBut perhaps that's not the point C we're looking for.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the condition that for point C, the equation x/p + y/q=1 has exactly one solution (p, q) on the unit circle, which is AB itself.\n\nSo, substituting y from AB into the equation:\n\nx/p + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] / q =1,\n\nwith p^2 + q^2=1.\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\nx/p + [ sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) ] / q =1.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nx/p + sqrt(3)(1/2 -x)/q =1.\n\nLet me denote k =1/2 -x, so:\n\nx/p + sqrt(3)k /q =1.\n\nBut k =1/2 -x, so x=1/2 -k.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n(1/2 -k)/p + sqrt(3)k /q =1.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as:\n\nx q + sqrt(3)k p = p q,\n\nwhere k=1/2 -x.\n\nSo,\n\nx q + sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) p = p q.\n\nRearranged:\n\nx q + sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) p -p q =0.\n\nFactor p:\n\np [ sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) - q ] +x q =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can solve for q in terms of p.\n\nLet me write:\n\np [ sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) - q ] = -x q.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 -x) p - p q = -x q.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nsqrt(3)(1/2 -x) p + q (x - p )=0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can solve for q:\n\nq (x - p )= - sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) p.\n\nSo,\n\nq= [ - sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) p ] / (x - p ).\n\nBut since p^2 + q^2=1, substitute q:\n\np^2 + [ (- sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) p ) / (x - p ) ]^2 =1.\n\nThis is a complicated equation, but perhaps I can find x such that this equation has exactly one solution p, which is p=1/2.\n\nSo, substituting p=1/2:\n\n(1/2)^2 + [ (- sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) * (1/2) ) / (x -1/2) ]^2 =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/4 + [ (- sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) *1/2 ) / (x -1/2) ]^2 =1.\n\nNote that (x -1/2)= -(1/2 -x), so:\n\n=1/4 + [ (- sqrt(3)(1/2 -x)*1/2 ) / ( - (1/2 -x) ) ]^2.\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n= [ (- sqrt(3)(1/2 -x)*1/2 ) / ( - (1/2 -x) ) ]\n\n= [ (sqrt(3)(1/2 -x)*1/2 ) / (1/2 -x) ) ]\n\n= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n1/4 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 =1.\n\nCompute:\n\n1/4 + 3/4=1, which holds.\n\nSo, p=1/2 is a solution for any x on AB. Now, we want that this is the only solution. So, the equation should have exactly one solution p=1/2.\n\nThus, the equation:\n\np^2 + [ (- sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) p ) / (x - p ) ]^2 =1,\n\nmust have exactly one solution p=1/2.\n\nSo, let me denote this equation as:\n\np^2 + [ (- sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) p ) / (x - p ) ]^2 =1.\n\nLet me denote t = p, so:\n\nt^2 + [ (- sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) t ) / (x - t ) ]^2 =1.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nt^2 + [ (sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) t ) / (t -x ) ]^2 =1.\n\nLet me compute this expression:\n\n= t^2 + [ sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) t / (t -x) ]^2.\n\nLet me factor out (1/2 -x)^2:\n\n= t^2 + 3 (1/2 -x)^2 t^2 / (t -x)^2.\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= t^2 [ 1 + 3 (1/2 -x)^2 / (t -x)^2 ].\n\nSet equal to 1:\n\nt^2 [ 1 + 3 (1/2 -x)^2 / (t -x)^2 ] =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can cross-multiply:\n\nt^2 (t -x)^2 + 3 (1/2 -x)^2 t^2 = (t -x)^2.\n\nLet me expand t^2 (t -x)^2:\n\n= t^2 (t^2 - 2x t +x^2).\n\n= t^4 -2x t^3 +x^2 t^2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nt^4 -2x t^3 +x^2 t^2 +3 (1/2 -x)^2 t^2 = t^2 -2x t +x^2.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nt^4 -2x t^3 +x^2 t^2 +3 (1/2 -x)^2 t^2 - t^2 +2x t -x^2=0.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nt^4 -2x t^3 + [x^2 +3(1/2 -x)^2 -1] t^2 +2x t -x^2=0.\n\nCompute the coefficient of t^2:\n\nx^2 +3*(1/4 -x +x^2) -1 =x^2 +3/4 -3x +3x^2 -1=4x^2 -3x -1/4.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nt^4 -2x t^3 + (4x^2 -3x -1/4) t^2 +2x t -x^2=0.\n\nWe know that t=1/2 is a root, so let's perform polynomial division to factor (t -1/2).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nDivide t^4 -2x t^3 + (4x^2 -3x -1/4) t^2 +2x t -x^2 by (t -1/2).\n\nSet up coefficients:\n\n1 | -2x | 4x^2 -3x -1/4 | 2x | -x^2.\n\nUsing t=1/2:\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: 1*(1/2)=1/2.\n\nAdd to next coefficient: -2x +1/2.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: (-2x +1/2)*(1/2)= -x +1/4.\n\nAdd to next coefficient:4x^2 -3x -1/4 + (-x +1/4)=4x^2 -4x.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: (4x^2 -4x)*(1/2)=2x^2 -2x.\n\nAdd to next coefficient:2x + (2x^2 -2x)=2x^2.\n\nMultiply by 1/2:2x^2*(1/2)=x^2.\n\nAdd to last coefficient: -x^2 +x^2=0.\n\nSo, the quotient polynomial is:\n\nt^3 + (-2x +1/2) t^2 + (4x^2 -4x) t +2x^2.\n\nSo, the equation factors as:\n\n(t -1/2)(t^3 + (-2x +1/2) t^2 + (4x^2 -4x) t +2x^2 )=0.\n\nNow, we want that the only solution is t=1/2, so the cubic must have no real roots other than t=1/2.\n\nBut for a cubic, it must have at least one real root. So, perhaps the cubic has a double root at t=1/2, making t=1/2 a triple root.\n\nSo, let's check if t=1/2 is a root of the cubic:\n\nEvaluate the cubic at t=1/2:\n\n(1/2)^3 + (-2x +1/2)(1/2)^2 + (4x^2 -4x)(1/2) +2x^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1/8 + (-2x +1/2)(1/4) + (4x^2 -4x)(1/2) +2x^2.\n\n=1/8 + (-2x/4 +1/8) + (2x^2 -2x) +2x^2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/8 -x/2 +1/8 +2x^2 -2x +2x^2.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(1/8 +1/8) + (-x/2 -2x) + (2x^2 +2x^2).\n\n= 1/4 - (5x/2) +4x^2.\n\nSet equal to zero:\n\n4x^2 - (5x/2) +1/4=0.\n\nMultiply by 4 to eliminate fractions:\n\n16x^2 -10x +1=0.\n\nSolve using quadratic formula:\n\nx = [10 \u00b1sqrt(100 -64)]/32 = [10 \u00b16]/32.\n\nSo,\n\nx=(16)/32=1/2,\n\nor x=(4)/32=1/8.\n\nSo, when x=1/2, t=1/2 is a root of the cubic, which makes sense because it's a root of the original equation. When x=1/8, t=1/2 is also a root.\n\nSo, for x=1/8, the cubic has a double root at t=1/2, making the original equation have a triple root at t=1/2.\n\nThus, the point C is at x=1/8 on AB.\n\nSo, substituting x=1/8 into AB's equation:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8 +4 sqrt(3)/8 )=3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nThus, OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 =1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nSo, p=7, q=16, and p+q=23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{23}\n\n\nGiven points \\( O(0,0) \\), \\( A\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right) \\), and \\( B\\left(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\), we need to find a point \\( C \\) on segment \\( \\overline{AB} \\) such that \\( C \\) does not belong to any segment from the family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) other than \\( \\overline{AB} \\). \n\n1. **Equation of Line AB**:\n   The line \\( AB \\) has a slope of \\( -\\sqrt{3} \\) and passes through \\( A \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to break it down.\n\nWe have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between 0 and 1, and B is on the y-axis a bit higher, since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. So, A is at (0.5, 0), and B is at (0, ~0.866). \n\nThe family of segments F consists of all segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ segment starts at some point P on the x-axis and ends at some point Q on the y-axis, and the distance between P and Q is 1. So, for example, if P is at (a, 0), then Q would be at (0, b) where sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 1. So, b = sqrt(1 - a\u00b2), right?\n\nSo, each such segment PQ is a line segment from (a, 0) to (0, sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)), for a between 0 and 1. Because if a is 0, then Q is at (0,1), and if a is 1, then Q is at (0,0), but since we're in the first quadrant, a ranges from 0 to 1, and Q ranges from (0,1) down to (0,0). Wait, but in the problem statement, it says segments lying in the first quadrant. So, maybe a can't be 0 or 1 because then the segment would be on the axis, but perhaps it's okay.\n\nAnyway, the family F consists of all such PQ segments. Now, the problem says that there is a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, C is on AB, and the only segment from F that passes through C is AB itself. So, AB is one of the PQ segments, right?\n\nWait, AB is from A (1/2, 0) to B (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the length of AB to confirm if it's a unit length. The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. Oh, so AB is indeed a segment of unit length in F. So AB is part of the family F.\n\nNow, the point C is on AB, not at A or B, and it's the only point on AB that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, for any other PQ in F (other than AB), C is not on PQ. So, C is unique in that sense.\n\nThe goal is to find OC\u00b2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.\n\nSo, first, I should probably parametrize point C on AB. Let me think about the equation of line AB.\n\nPoints A and B are (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Plugging in A's coordinates: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c, so c = sqrt(3)/2. Thus, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, any point C on AB can be written as (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2), where t ranges from 0 to 1/2. Because when x=1/2, y=0, and when x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, C is (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2). Now, we need to find t such that C is not on any other PQ in F except AB.\n\nSo, for C to not lie on any other PQ, the line PQ (other than AB) should not pass through C.\n\nBut wait, each PQ is a segment from (a,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)). So, the equation of PQ can be found. Let me find the equation for a general PQ.\n\nFor a given a, the line PQ connects (a, 0) to (0, sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)). So, the slope of PQ is (sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) - 0)/(0 - a) = -sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a. So, the equation is y = (-sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a)x + sqrt(1 - a\u00b2).\n\nBecause when x=0, y=sqrt(1 - a\u00b2), and when x=a, y=0.\n\nSo, the equation of PQ is y = (-sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a)x + sqrt(1 - a\u00b2).\n\nNow, for point C(t, y_c) to lie on PQ, it must satisfy this equation. So, substituting x = t and y = y_c:\n\ny_c = (-sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a)*t + sqrt(1 - a\u00b2).\n\nBut y_c is also equal to -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2, from the equation of AB.\n\nSo, equating the two expressions for y_c:\n\n-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a)*t + sqrt(1 - a\u00b2).\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to solve for a in terms of t. So,\n\n(-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) = (-sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a)*t + sqrt(1 - a\u00b2).\n\nLet me move all terms to one side:\n\n(-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a)*t - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) = 0.\n\nFactor terms:\n\nt*(-sqrt(3) + sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a) + (sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)) = 0.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can write it as:\n\nsqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a * t - sqrt(3) t + (sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)) = 0.\n\nLet me factor sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) and sqrt(3) terms:\n\nsqrt(1 - a\u00b2)*(t/a - 1) + sqrt(3)*(-t + 1/2) = 0.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(1 - a\u00b2)*(t/a - 1) = sqrt(3)*(t - 1/2).\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square roots. But I have to remember that squaring can introduce extraneous solutions, so I'll have to check later.\n\nSo,\n\n[ sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)*(t/a - 1) ]\u00b2 = [ sqrt(3)*(t - 1/2) ]\u00b2\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n(1 - a\u00b2)*(t/a - 1)^2 = 3*(t - 1/2)^2.\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side:\n\n(1 - a\u00b2)*( (t/a - 1) )\u00b2.\n\nFirst, (t/a - 1) = (t - a)/a. So, squared: (t - a)^2 / a\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nLeft side: (1 - a\u00b2)*(t - a)^2 / a\u00b2.\n\nRight side: 3*(t - 1/2)^2.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 - a\u00b2)*(t - a)^2 / a\u00b2 = 3*(t - 1/2)^2.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\n(1 - a\u00b2)/a\u00b2 * (t - a)^2 = 3*(t - 1/2)^2.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n( (1 - a\u00b2)/(a\u00b2) ) * (t - a)^2 = 3*(t - 1/2)^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can let u = a, and solve for u in terms of t. But this might be a quadratic equation in a.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about this as a quadratic equation in a. Let's see.\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nFirst, the left side:\n\n(1 - a\u00b2)(t - a)^2 / a\u00b2.\n\nExpand (t - a)^2 = t\u00b2 - 2ta + a\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nLeft side: (1 - a\u00b2)(t\u00b2 - 2ta + a\u00b2) / a\u00b2.\n\nMultiply out (1 - a\u00b2)(t\u00b2 - 2ta + a\u00b2):\n\n= (1)(t\u00b2 - 2ta + a\u00b2) - a\u00b2(t\u00b2 - 2ta + a\u00b2)\n\n= t\u00b2 - 2ta + a\u00b2 - a\u00b2 t\u00b2 + 2ta\u00b3 - a^4.\n\nSo,\n\nLeft side: [ t\u00b2 - 2ta + a\u00b2 - a\u00b2 t\u00b2 + 2ta\u00b3 - a^4 ] / a\u00b2.\n\nDivide each term by a\u00b2:\n\n= t\u00b2/a\u00b2 - 2t/a + 1 - t\u00b2 + 2ta - a\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nt\u00b2/a\u00b2 - 2ta/a\u00b2 + a\u00b2/a\u00b2 - a\u00b2 t\u00b2/a\u00b2 + 2ta\u00b3/a\u00b2 - a^4/a\u00b2.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nt\u00b2/a\u00b2 - 2t/a + 1 - t\u00b2 + 2ta - a\u00b2.\n\nSo, the left side is:\n\nt\u00b2/a\u00b2 - 2t/a + 1 - t\u00b2 + 2ta - a\u00b2.\n\nThe right side is 3*(t - 1/2)^2 = 3*(t\u00b2 - t + 1/4) = 3t\u00b2 - 3t + 3/4.\n\nSo, now set left side equal to right side:\n\nt\u00b2/a\u00b2 - 2t/a + 1 - t\u00b2 + 2ta - a\u00b2 = 3t\u00b2 - 3t + 3/4.\n\nLet me move all terms to the left side:\n\nt\u00b2/a\u00b2 - 2t/a + 1 - t\u00b2 + 2ta - a\u00b2 - 3t\u00b2 + 3t - 3/4 = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nt\u00b2/a\u00b2 - 2t/a + 1 - t\u00b2 - 3t\u00b2 + 2ta - a\u00b2 + 3t - 3/4 = 0.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nt\u00b2/a\u00b2,\n\n-2t/a,\n\n1,\n\n- t\u00b2 -3t\u00b2 = -4t\u00b2,\n\n+2ta,\n\n- a\u00b2,\n\n+3t,\n\n-3/4.\n\nSo, putting together:\n\nt\u00b2/a\u00b2 - 2t/a + (1 - 3/4) + (-4t\u00b2) + 2ta + (-a\u00b2) + 3t = 0.\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n1 - 3/4 = 1/4.\n\nSo,\n\nt\u00b2/a\u00b2 - 2t/a + 1/4 -4t\u00b2 + 2ta - a\u00b2 + 3t = 0.\n\nHmm, this looks complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of trying to solve for a in terms of t, I can think of this as a quadratic equation in a.\n\nLet me collect terms with a\u00b2, a, etc.\n\nLooking back at the equation before expanding:\n\n(1 - a\u00b2)*(t - a)^2 / a\u00b2 = 3*(t - 1/2)^2.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n(1 - a\u00b2)(t - a)^2 = 3 a\u00b2 (t - 1/2)^2.\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: (1 - a\u00b2)(t\u00b2 - 2ta + a\u00b2) = t\u00b2 - 2ta + a\u00b2 - a\u00b2 t\u00b2 + 2ta\u00b3 - a^4.\n\nRight side: 3a\u00b2 (t^2 - t + 1/4) = 3a\u00b2 t^2 - 3a\u00b2 t + (3/4) a\u00b2.\n\nNow, bring all terms to the left:\n\nt\u00b2 - 2ta + a\u00b2 - a\u00b2 t\u00b2 + 2ta\u00b3 - a^4 - 3a\u00b2 t^2 + 3a\u00b2 t - (3/4)a\u00b2 = 0.\n\nNow, let's group terms by powers of a.\n\nLet's list each term:\n\n- a^4,\n\n+2ta\u00b3,\n\n(-a\u00b2 t\u00b2 - 3a\u00b2 t\u00b2) = -4a\u00b2 t\u00b2,\n\n+a\u00b2,\n\n+3a\u00b2 t,\n\n- (3/4)a\u00b2,\n\n-2ta,\n\n+t\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terms with a^4, a^3, a^2, a, and constants.\n\nSo:\n\n- a^4,\n\n+ 2t a^3,\n\n(- t\u00b2 a\u00b2 - 3 t^2 a\u00b2) = (-4 t\u00b2 a^2),\n\n+ a^2,\n\n+ 3 t a^2,\n\n- (3/4) a^2,\n\n- 2 t a,\n\n+ t^2.\n\nNow, collect like terms:\n\na^4: -1 a^4.\n\na^3: +2t a^3.\n\na^2: (-4t\u00b2 + 1 + 3t - 3/4) a^2.\n\na: -2t a.\n\nConstants: +t^2.\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficients:\n\na^4: -1.\n\na^3: +2t.\n\na^2: (-4t\u00b2 + (1 - 3/4) + 3t) = (-4t\u00b2 + 1/4 + 3t).\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. The a^2 terms are:\n\n-4t\u00b2 a\u00b2 (from the -a\u00b2 t\u00b2 and -3a\u00b2 t\u00b2),\n\n+a\u00b2,\n\n+3t a\u00b2,\n\n-3/4 a\u00b2.\n\nSo, combining:\n\na\u00b2 (-4t\u00b2 + 1 + 3t - 3/4).\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n1 - 3/4 = 1/4.\n\nSo, a^2 terms: a\u00b2 (-4t\u00b2 + 3t + 1/4).\n\nSimilarly, a terms: -2t a.\n\nConstants: t^2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the equation becomes:\n\n- a^4 + 2t a^3 + (-4t\u00b2 + 3t + 1/4) a^2 - 2t a + t^2 = 0.\n\nThis is a quartic equation in a, which looks really complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of parametrizing a, I can think about the condition that C doesn't lie on any other PQ except AB. That is, for C to lie only on AB and no other PQ, the equation we derived earlier must have exactly one solution for a, which is a=1/2, corresponding to AB. So, perhaps the equation we derived has a double root at a=1/2, meaning that AB is the only PQ passing through C. Alternatively, maybe for C, the equation has no solution except a=1/2. Hmm, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the envelope of the family of lines F. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. Points on the envelope are touched by exactly one member of the family. So, perhaps C is a point on AB that lies on the envelope of F.\n\nWait, that might be the case. Because if C is only on AB and no other PQ, then it might lie on the envelope of F.\n\nSo, maybe I can find the envelope of the family of lines F, and then find where AB intersects this envelope. The intersection point would be C.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nThe family of lines F is given by y = (-sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a) x + sqrt(1 - a\u00b2), where a is a parameter between 0 and 1.\n\nTo find the envelope, I can use the method of solving for the envelope by eliminating the parameter a from the equation and its derivative with respect to a.\n\nSo, let's denote the equation of PQ as F(a, x, y) = y + (sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a) x - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) = 0.\n\nWait, no, the equation is y = (-sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a) x + sqrt(1 - a\u00b2). So, rearranged: y + (sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a) x - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) = 0. So, F(a, x, y) = y + (sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a) x - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) = 0.\n\nTo find the envelope, we can take the derivative of F with respect to a and set it equal to zero.\n\nCompute dF/da:\n\ndF/da = 0 + [ ( (1/(2 sqrt(1 - a\u00b2))) * (2a) ) / a - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a\u00b2 ] x - [ ( (1/(2 sqrt(1 - a\u00b2))) * 2a ) ] = 0.\n\nWait, let me compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, F(a, x, y) = y + (sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a) x - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) = 0.\n\nSo, dF/da is:\n\nd/da [ y ] + d/da [ (sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a) x ] - d/da [ sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ] = 0.\n\nSince y and x are variables, their derivatives with respect to a are zero.\n\nSo,\n\ndF/da = 0 + x * d/da [ sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a ] - d/da [ sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ] = 0.\n\nCompute each derivative:\n\nFirst, d/da [ sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a ]:\n\nLet me write this as (1 - a\u00b2)^(1/2) / a.\n\nUsing the quotient rule:\n\nLet u = (1 - a\u00b2)^(1/2), v = a.\n\ndu/da = (1/2)(1 - a\u00b2)^(-1/2) * (-2a) = -a / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2).\n\ndv/da = 1.\n\nSo,\n\nd/da [ u/v ] = (v du/da - u dv/da) / v\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n= [ a*(-a / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)) - (1 - a\u00b2)^(1/2)*1 ] / a\u00b2.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n= [ -a\u00b2 / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ].\n\nFactor sqrt(1 - a\u00b2):\n\n= [ (-a\u00b2 - (1 - a\u00b2)) / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ]\n\n= [ (-a\u00b2 -1 + a\u00b2) / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ]\n\n= (-1)/sqrt(1 - a\u00b2).\n\nSo, d/da [ sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a ] = (-1)/sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) * (1/a\u00b2).\n\nWait, no, because the denominator is v\u00b2 = a\u00b2. So,\n\nd/da [ sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a ] = [ (-a\u00b2 - (1 - a\u00b2)) / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ] / a\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me compute it again.\n\nd/da [ sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a ]:\n\n= [ ( -a / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ) * a - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) * 1 ] / a\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, the quotient rule is (v du - u dv)/v\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nv = a,\n\nu = sqrt(1 - a\u00b2),\n\ndu/da = (-a)/sqrt(1 - a\u00b2),\n\ndv/da = 1.\n\nSo,\n\n(v du - u dv)/v\u00b2 = [ a*(-a)/sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)*1 ] / a\u00b2.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n= [ (-a\u00b2)/sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ].\n\nFactor sqrt(1 - a\u00b2):\n\n= [ (-a\u00b2 - (1 - a\u00b2)) / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ]\n\n= [ (-a\u00b2 -1 + a\u00b2) / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ]\n\n= (-1)/sqrt(1 - a\u00b2).\n\nSo, numerator is (-1)/sqrt(1 - a\u00b2), denominator is a\u00b2.\n\nSo, d/da [ sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a ] = (-1)/sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) / a\u00b2 = -1/(a\u00b2 sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)).\n\nNow, the second derivative is d/da [ sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ].\n\nWhich is (1/2)(1 - a\u00b2)^(-1/2) * (-2a) = -a / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2).\n\nPutting it all together, dF/da is:\n\nx * [ -1/(a\u00b2 sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)) ] - [ -a / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ] = 0.\n\nSo,\n\n- x/(a\u00b2 sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)) + a / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(1 - a\u00b2):\n\n- x/(a\u00b2) + a = 0.\n\nSo,\n\na = x/(a\u00b2).\n\nMultiply both sides by a\u00b2:\n\na^3 = x.\n\nSo, from the envelope condition, we get a = cube root of x.\n\nWait, that seems interesting. So, a = x^{1/3}.\n\nWait, but let me check that step again.\n\nFrom the equation:\n\n- x/(a\u00b2) + a = 0.\n\nSo,\n\na = x/(a\u00b2).\n\nMultiply both sides by a\u00b2:\n\na^3 = x.\n\nSo, a = x^{1/3}.\n\nSo, now, substituting back into F(a, x, y) = 0.\n\nF(a, x, y) = y + (sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a) x - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) = 0.\n\nBut since a = x^{1/3}, let's substitute a = x^{1/3}.\n\nSo,\n\ny + (sqrt(1 - (x^{1/3})^2)/x^{1/3}) * x - sqrt(1 - (x^{1/3})^2) = 0.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nsqrt(1 - x^{2/3}) / x^{1/3} * x = sqrt(1 - x^{2/3}) * x^{2/3}.\n\nBecause x / x^{1/3} = x^{1 - 1/3} = x^{2/3}.\n\nSo,\n\ny + sqrt(1 - x^{2/3}) * x^{2/3} - sqrt(1 - x^{2/3}) = 0.\n\nFactor sqrt(1 - x^{2/3}):\n\ny + sqrt(1 - x^{2/3}) (x^{2/3} - 1) = 0.\n\nSo,\n\ny = sqrt(1 - x^{2/3}) (1 - x^{2/3}).\n\nBecause (x^{2/3} - 1) = -(1 - x^{2/3}).\n\nSo,\n\ny = sqrt(1 - x^{2/3}) * (1 - x^{2/3}).\n\nWhich is,\n\ny = (1 - x^{2/3})^{3/2}.\n\nSo, the envelope of the family F is the curve y = (1 - x^{2/3})^{3/2}.\n\nHmm, that's an interesting curve. Now, the point C lies on AB and on the envelope, so it must satisfy both equations: the equation of AB and the envelope.\n\nSo, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nThe envelope is y = (1 - x^{2/3})^{3/2}.\n\nSo, we can set these equal to each other:\n\n-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 = (1 - x^{2/3})^{3/2}.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nsqrt(3)(-x + 1/2) = (1 - x^{2/3})^{3/2}.\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root on the right:\n\n[ sqrt(3)(-x + 1/2) ]^2 = [ (1 - x^{2/3})^{3/2} ]^2.\n\nSo,\n\n3*(-x + 1/2)^2 = (1 - x^{2/3})^3.\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side:\n\n3*(x^2 - x + 1/4).\n\nRight side:\n\n(1 - x^{2/3})^3.\n\nExpanding the right side using binomial expansion:\n\n= 1^3 - 3*1^2*x^{2/3} + 3*1*(x^{2/3})^2 - (x^{2/3})^3.\n\n= 1 - 3x^{2/3} + 3x^{4/3} - x^2.\n\nSo, left side is 3x\u00b2 - 3x + 3/4.\n\nRight side is 1 - 3x^{2/3} + 3x^{4/3} - x\u00b2.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n3x\u00b2 -3x + 3/4 -1 +3x^{2/3} -3x^{4/3} +x\u00b2 = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3x\u00b2 + x\u00b2 =4x\u00b2,\n\n-3x,\n\n3/4 -1 = -1/4,\n\n+3x^{2/3},\n\n-3x^{4/3}.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n4x\u00b2 -3x -1/4 +3x^{2/3} -3x^{4/3} =0.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can make a substitution.\n\nLet me let u = x^{1/3}, so that x = u^3.\n\nThen, x^{2/3} = u^2,\n\nx^{4/3} = u^4,\n\nx\u00b2 = u^6.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n4u^6 -3u^3 -1/4 +3u^2 -3u^4 =0.\n\nLet me write the terms in order of descending powers of u:\n\n4u^6 -3u^4 +3u^2 -3u^3 -1/4 =0.\n\nWait, maybe I should arrange them:\n\n4u^6 -3u^4 -3u^3 +3u^2 -1/4 =0.\n\nThis is a sixth-degree polynomial, which looks difficult to solve. Maybe I can factor it.\n\nLet me try to factor this equation.\n\nPerhaps I can look for rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term over factors of the leading coefficient. The constant term is -1/4, and leading coefficient is 4. So possible roots are \u00b11, \u00b11/2, \u00b11/4, etc., but let me test u=1/2.\n\nSubstitute u=1/2:\n\n4*(1/2)^6 -3*(1/2)^4 -3*(1/2)^3 +3*(1/2)^2 -1/4.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4*(1/64) = 4/64=1/16,\n\n-3*(1/16)= -3/16,\n\n-3*(1/8)= -3/8,\n\n3*(1/4)=3/4,\n\n-1/4.\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n1/16 -3/16 -3/8 +3/4 -1/4.\n\nConvert to 16 denominators:\n\n1/16 - 3/16 -6/16 +12/16 -4/16.\n\nTotal: (1 -3 -6 +12 -4)/16 = (0)/16 = 0.\n\nSo, u=1/2 is a root. So, (u - 1/2) is a factor.\n\nNow, let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out (u - 1/2).\n\nLet me write the polynomial as:\n\n4u^6 -3u^4 -3u^3 +3u^2 -1/4.\n\nWait, but when I tested u=1/2, it worked. So, let's perform synthetic division.\n\nBut the polynomial is:\n\n4u^6 + 0u^5 -3u^4 -3u^3 +3u^2 +0u -1/4.\n\nWait, actually, the original substitution gives:\n\n4u^6 -3u^4 -3u^3 +3u^2 -1/4.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write all degrees:\n\n4u^6 +0u^5 -3u^4 -3u^3 +3u^2 +0u -1/4.\n\nDivided by (u - 1/2).\n\nUsing synthetic division for u=1/2.\n\nThe coefficients are:\n\n4, 0, -3, -3, 3, 0, -1/4.\n\nBring down the 4.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: 4*(1/2)=2.\n\nAdd to next coefficient: 0+2=2.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: 2*(1/2)=1.\n\nAdd to next coefficient: -3 +1= -2.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: -2*(1/2)=-1.\n\nAdd to next coefficient: -3 + (-1)= -4.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: -4*(1/2)=-2.\n\nAdd to next coefficient:3 + (-2)=1.\n\nMultiply by 1/2:1*(1/2)=1/2.\n\nAdd to next coefficient:0 +1/2=1/2.\n\nMultiply by1/2: (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4.\n\nAdd to last coefficient: (-1/4) +1/4=0.\n\nSo, the result is:\n\n4u^5 +2u^4 -2u^3 -4u^2 +u +1/2.\n\nSo, the polynomial factors as (u -1/2)(4u^5 +2u^4 -2u^3 -4u^2 +u +1/2).\n\nHmm, now I need to find other roots. Maybe u=1/2 is a repeated root?\n\nLet me test u=1/2 again in the new polynomial:\n\n4*(1/2)^5 +2*(1/2)^4 -2*(1/2)^3 -4*(1/2)^2 + (1/2) +1/2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4*(1/32)=4/32=1/8,\n\n2*(1/16)=2/16=1/8,\n\n-2*(1/8)= -1/4,\n\n-4*(1/4)= -1,\n\n1/2,\n\n1/2.\n\nSum: 1/8 +1/8=1/4; -1/4; so 1/4 -1/4=0.\n\nThen, -1 +1/2 +1/2= -1 +1=0.\n\nSo, u=1/2 is a root again. So, (u -1/2)^2 is a factor.\n\nLet me perform synthetic division again on the quintic polynomial.\n\nThe quintic coefficients are:\n\n4, 2, -2, -4, 1, 1/2.\n\nDivided by (u -1/2).\n\nUsing synthetic division with u=1/2.\n\nBring down 4.\n\nMultiply by 1/2:4*(1/2)=2.\n\nAdd to next coefficient:2 +2=4.\n\nMultiply by1/2:4*(1/2)=2.\n\nAdd to next coefficient:-2 +2=0.\n\nMultiply by1/2:0*(1/2)=0.\n\nAdd to next coefficient:-4 +0=-4.\n\nMultiply by1/2:-4*(1/2)=-2.\n\nAdd to next coefficient:1 + (-2)=-1.\n\nMultiply by1/2:-1*(1/2)=-1/2.\n\nAdd to last coefficient:1/2 + (-1/2)=0.\n\nSo, the quintic factors into (u -1/2)(4u^4 +4u^3 +0u^2 -4u -1).\n\nSo, the original polynomial is now (u -1/2)^2*(4u^4 +4u^3 -4u -1).\n\nNow, let me try to factor 4u^4 +4u^3 -4u -1.\n\nPerhaps I can factor by grouping.\n\nGroup terms:\n\n(4u^4 +4u^3) + (-4u -1).\n\nFactor 4u^3 from the first group: 4u^3(u +1).\n\nFactor -1 from the second group: -1*(4u +1).\n\nHmm, but that doesn't seem to help. Alternatively, maybe try to factor as a product of quadratics.\n\nAssume it factors into (au\u00b2 + bu +c)(du\u00b2 + eu +f).\n\nMultiply them:\n\nad u^4 + (ae + bd)u^3 + (af + be + cd)u^2 + (bf + ce)u + cf.\n\nCompare to 4u^4 +4u^3 +0u^2 -4u -1.\n\nSo,\n\nad =4,\n\nae + bd=4,\n\naf + be + cd=0,\n\nbf + ce= -4,\n\ncf= -1.\n\nLooking for integer coefficients, perhaps.\n\nSince cf=-1, possible options are c=1, f=-1 or c=-1, f=1.\n\nLet me try c=1, f=-1.\n\nThen,\n\nad=4. Let's try a=4, d=1.\n\nSo, a=4, d=1, c=1, f=-1.\n\nNow,\n\nae + bd=4* e + b*1=4e +b=4.\n\nNext,\n\naf + be + cd=4*(-1) +b*e +1*1= -4 +b e +1= -3 +b e=0 \u21d2 b e=3.\n\nAnd,\n\nbf + ce= b*(-1) + e*1= -b + e= -4.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1. 4e + b =4.\n\n2. b e=3.\n\n3. -b + e= -4.\n\nLet me try to solve these equations.\n\nFrom equation 3: e = b -4.\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\n4*(b -4) + b=4 \u21d24b -16 +b=4 \u21d25b=20 \u21d2b=4.\n\nThen, e=4 -4=0.\n\nBut then equation 2: b e=4*0=0 \u22603. So, no solution.\n\nNext, try a=2, d=2.\n\na=2, d=2.\n\nThen,\n\nae + bd=2e +2b=4.\n\nAnd,\n\naf + be + cd=2*(-1) +b e +2*1= -2 +b e +2= b e=0 \u21d2b e=0.\n\nBut from equation 2, we have b e=3, which is impossible. So, no solution.\n\nNext, try a=1, d=4.\n\nThen,\n\nae + bd=1*e +b*4= e +4b=4.\n\nFrom equation 3:\n\n-b + e= -4 \u21d2e= b -4.\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\n(b -4) +4b=4 \u21d25b -4=4 \u21d25b=8 \u21d2b=8/5, which is not integer. So, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, try a=4, d=1 as before but with c=-1, f=1.\n\nSo, a=4, d=1, c=-1, f=1.\n\nThen,\n\nae + bd=4e +b=4.\n\naf + be + cd=4*1 +b e + (-1)*1=4 +b e -1=3 +b e=0 \u21d2b e= -3.\n\nbf + ce= b*1 + e*(-1)=b -e= -4.\n\nSo,\n\nFrom equation 3: b - e= -4 \u21d2e= b +4.\n\nFrom equation 1:4e +b=4 \u21d24*(b+4) +b=4 \u21d24b +16 +b=4 \u21d25b= -12 \u21d2b= -12/5, which is not integer. So, no solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a= -2, d=-2.\n\nBut maybe this approach isn't working. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me try to see if 4u^4 +4u^3 -4u -1 has any rational roots.\n\nPossible roots are \u00b11, \u00b11/2, \u00b11/4.\n\nTest u=1: 4 +4 -4 -1=3\u22600.\n\nu=-1:4*(-1)^4 +4*(-1)^3 -4*(-1) -1=4 -4 +4 -1=3\u22600.\n\nu=1/2:4*(1/2)^4 +4*(1/2)^3 -4*(1/2) -1=4*(1/16)+4*(1/8) -2 -1=1/4 +1/2 -3= (1 + 2)/4 -3= 3/4 -3= -9/4 \u22600.\n\nu=-1/2:4*(1/16)+4*(-1/8) -4*(-1/2) -1= 1/4 - 1/2 +2 -1= (1/4 -1/2) +1= (-1/4) +1= 3/4 \u22600.\n\nu=1/4:4*(1/256) +4*(1/64) -4*(1/4) -1= 1/64 + 1/16 -1 -1= (1 +4)/64 -2=5/64 -2= -117/64 \u22600.\n\nSo, no rational roots. So, maybe it's irreducible. Therefore, perhaps the only real roots are u=1/2 (with multiplicity 2) and others are complex. So, in the real numbers, the only solution is u=1/2.\n\nSo, going back, the only real solution for u is 1/2. Therefore, x= u^3= (1/2)^3=1/8.\n\nSo, x=1/8.\n\nNow, substitute x=1/8 into the envelope equation to find y.\n\nFrom the envelope: y = (1 - x^{2/3})^{3/2}.\n\nx^{2/3}= (1/8)^{2/3}= (1/8)^{1/3 * 2}= (1/2)^{2}=1/4.\n\nSo,\n\ny= (1 - 1/4)^{3/2}= (3/4)^{3/2}= (sqrt(3/4))^3= (sqrt(3)/2)^3= (3*sqrt(3))/8.\n\nWait, but wait: (3/4)^{3/2}= (sqrt(3/4))^3= (sqrt(3)/2)^3= (3*sqrt(3))/8. So, yes.\n\nSo, point C is at (1/8, 3\u221a3/8).\n\nBut wait, we need to check if this point lies on AB.\n\nThe equation of AB is y= -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAt x=1/8,\n\ny= -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2= (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8)= (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nWhich matches the y-coordinate from the envelope. So, yes, C is at (1/8, 3\u221a3/8).\n\nSo, now, we need to compute OC\u00b2, where O is (0,0).\n\nOC\u00b2= (1/8)^2 + (3\u221a3/8)^2= 1/64 + (27)/64= (1 +27)/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nSo, OC\u00b2=7/16.\n\nThus, p=7, q=16, and p+q=23.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 7 and 16 are coprime, yes.\n\nSo, the answer is 23.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to break it down.\n\nWe have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between 0 and 1, and B is on the y-axis a bit higher, since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. So, A is at (0.5, 0), and B is at (0, ~0.866). \n\nThe family of segments F consists of all segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ segment starts at some point P on the x-axis and ends at some point Q on the y-axis, and the distance between P and Q is 1. So, for example, if P is at (a, 0), then Q would be at (0, b) where sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 1. So, b = sqrt(1 - a\u00b2), right?\n\nSo, each such segment PQ is a line segment from (a, 0) to (0, sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)), for a between 0 and 1. Because if a is 0, then Q is at (0,1), and if a is 1, then Q is at (0,0), but since we're in the first quadrant, a ranges from 0 to 1, and Q ranges from (0,1) down to (0,0). Wait, but in the problem statement, it says segments lying in the first quadrant. So, maybe a can't be 0 or 1 because then the segment would be on the axis, but perhaps it's okay.\n\nAnyway, the family F consists of all such PQ segments. Now, the problem says that there is a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, C is on AB, and the only segment from F that passes through C is AB itself. So, AB is one of the PQ segments, right?\n\nWait, AB is from A (1/2, 0) to B (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the length of AB to confirm if it's a unit length. The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. Oh, so AB is indeed a segment of unit length in F. So AB is part of the family F.\n\nNow, the point C is on AB, not at A or B, and it's the only point on AB that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, for any other PQ in F (other than AB), C is not on PQ. So, C is unique in that sense.\n\nThe goal is to find OC\u00b2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.\n\nSo, first, I should probably parametrize point C on AB. Let me think about the equation of line AB.\n\nPoints A and B are (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Plugging in A's coordinates: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c, so c = sqrt(3)/2. Thus, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, any point C on AB can be written as (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2), where t ranges from 0 to 1/2. Because when x=1/2, y=0, and when x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, C is (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2). Now, we need to find t such that C is not on any other PQ in F except AB.\n\nSo, for C to not lie on any other PQ, the line PQ (other than AB) should not pass through C.\n\nBut wait, each PQ is a segment from (a,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)). So, the equation of PQ can be found. Let me find the equation for a general PQ.\n\nFor a given a, the line PQ connects (a, 0) to (0, sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)). So, the slope of PQ is (sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) - 0)/(0 - a) = -sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a. So, the equation is y = (-sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a)x + sqrt(1 - a\u00b2).\n\nBecause when x=0, y=sqrt(1 - a\u00b2), and when x=a, y=0.\n\nSo, the equation of PQ is y = (-sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a)x + sqrt(1 - a\u00b2).\n\nNow, for point C(t, y_c) to lie on PQ, it must satisfy this equation. So, substituting x = t and y = y_c:\n\ny_c = (-sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a)*t + sqrt(1 - a\u00b2).\n\nBut y_c is also equal to -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2, from the equation of AB.\n\nSo, equating the two expressions for y_c:\n\n-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a)*t + sqrt(1 - a\u00b2).\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to solve for a in terms of t. So,\n\n(-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) = (-sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a)*t + sqrt(1 - a\u00b2).\n\nLet me move all terms to one side:\n\n(-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a)*t - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) = 0.\n\nFactor terms:\n\nt*(-sqrt(3) + sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a) + (sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)) = 0.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can write it as:\n\nsqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a * t - sqrt(3) t + (sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)) = 0.\n\nLet me factor sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) and sqrt(3) terms:\n\nsqrt(1 - a\u00b2)*(t/a - 1) + sqrt(3)*(-t + 1/2) = 0.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(1 - a\u00b2)*(t/a - 1) = sqrt(3)*(t - 1/2).\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square roots. But I have to remember that squaring can introduce extraneous solutions, so I'll have to check later.\n\nSo,\n\n[ sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)*(t/a - 1) ]\u00b2 = [ sqrt(3)*(t - 1/2) ]\u00b2\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n(1 - a\u00b2)*(t/a - 1)^2 = 3*(t - 1/2)^2.\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side:\n\n(1 - a\u00b2)*( (t/a - 1) )\u00b2.\n\nFirst, (t/a - 1) = (t - a)/a. So, squared: (t - a)^2 / a\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nLeft side: (1 - a\u00b2)*(t - a)^2 / a\u00b2.\n\nRight side: 3*(t - 1/2)^2.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 - a\u00b2)*(t - a)^2 / a\u00b2 = 3*(t - 1/2)^2.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\n(1 - a\u00b2)/a\u00b2 * (t - a)^2 = 3*(t - 1/2)^2.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n( (1 - a\u00b2)/(a\u00b2) ) * (t - a)^2 = 3*(t - 1/2)^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can let u = a, and solve for u in terms of t. But this might be a quadratic equation in a.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about this as a quadratic equation in a. Let's see.\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nFirst, the left side:\n\n(1 - a\u00b2)(t - a)^2 / a\u00b2.\n\nExpand (t - a)^2 = t\u00b2 - 2ta + a\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nLeft side: (1 - a\u00b2)(t\u00b2 - 2ta + a\u00b2) / a\u00b2.\n\nMultiply out (1 - a\u00b2)(t\u00b2 - 2ta + a\u00b2):\n\n= (1)(t\u00b2 - 2ta + a\u00b2) - a\u00b2(t\u00b2 - 2ta + a\u00b2)\n\n= t\u00b2 - 2ta + a\u00b2 - a\u00b2 t\u00b2 + 2ta\u00b3 - a^4.\n\nSo,\n\nLeft side: [ t\u00b2 - 2ta + a\u00b2 - a\u00b2 t\u00b2 + 2ta\u00b3 - a^4 ] / a\u00b2.\n\nDivide each term by a\u00b2:\n\n= t\u00b2/a\u00b2 - 2t/a + 1 - t\u00b2 + 2ta - a\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nt\u00b2/a\u00b2 - 2ta/a\u00b2 + a\u00b2/a\u00b2 - a\u00b2 t\u00b2/a\u00b2 + 2ta\u00b3/a\u00b2 - a^4/a\u00b2.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nt\u00b2/a\u00b2 - 2t/a + 1 - t\u00b2 + 2ta - a\u00b2.\n\nSo, the left side is:\n\nt\u00b2/a\u00b2 - 2t/a + 1 - t\u00b2 + 2ta - a\u00b2.\n\nThe right side is 3*(t - 1/2)^2 = 3*(t\u00b2 - t + 1/4) = 3t\u00b2 - 3t + 3/4.\n\nSo, now set left side equal to right side:\n\nt\u00b2/a\u00b2 - 2t/a + 1 - t\u00b2 + 2ta - a\u00b2 = 3t\u00b2 - 3t + 3/4.\n\nLet me move all terms to the left side:\n\nt\u00b2/a\u00b2 - 2t/a + 1 - t\u00b2 + 2ta - a\u00b2 - 3t\u00b2 + 3t - 3/4 = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nt\u00b2/a\u00b2 - 2t/a + 1 - t\u00b2 - 3t\u00b2 + 2ta - a\u00b2 + 3t - 3/4 = 0.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nt\u00b2/a\u00b2,\n\n-2t/a,\n\n1,\n\n- t\u00b2 -3t\u00b2 = -4t\u00b2,\n\n+2ta,\n\n- a\u00b2,\n\n+3t,\n\n-3/4.\n\nSo, putting together:\n\nt\u00b2/a\u00b2 - 2t/a + (1 - 3/4) + (-4t\u00b2) + 2ta + (-a\u00b2) + 3t = 0.\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n1 - 3/4 = 1/4.\n\nSo,\n\nt\u00b2/a\u00b2 - 2t/a + 1/4 -4t\u00b2 + 2ta - a\u00b2 + 3t = 0.\n\nHmm, this looks complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of trying to solve for a in terms of t, I can think of this as a quadratic equation in a.\n\nLet me collect terms with a\u00b2, a, etc.\n\nLooking back at the equation before expanding:\n\n(1 - a\u00b2)*(t - a)^2 / a\u00b2 = 3*(t - 1/2)^2.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n(1 - a\u00b2)(t - a)^2 = 3 a\u00b2 (t - 1/2)^2.\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: (1 - a\u00b2)(t\u00b2 - 2ta + a\u00b2) = t\u00b2 - 2ta + a\u00b2 - a\u00b2 t\u00b2 + 2ta\u00b3 - a^4.\n\nRight side: 3a\u00b2 (t^2 - t + 1/4) = 3a\u00b2 t^2 - 3a\u00b2 t + (3/4) a\u00b2.\n\nNow, bring all terms to the left:\n\nt\u00b2 - 2ta + a\u00b2 - a\u00b2 t\u00b2 + 2ta\u00b3 - a^4 - 3a\u00b2 t^2 + 3a\u00b2 t - (3/4)a\u00b2 = 0.\n\nNow, let's group terms by powers of a.\n\nLet's list each term:\n\n- a^4,\n\n+2ta\u00b3,\n\n(-a\u00b2 t\u00b2 - 3a\u00b2 t\u00b2) = -4a\u00b2 t\u00b2,\n\n+a\u00b2,\n\n+3a\u00b2 t,\n\n- (3/4)a\u00b2,\n\n-2ta,\n\n+t\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terms with a^4, a^3, a^2, a, and constants.\n\nSo:\n\n- a^4,\n\n+ 2t a^3,\n\n(- t\u00b2 a\u00b2 - 3 t^2 a\u00b2) = (-4 t\u00b2 a^2),\n\n+ a^2,\n\n+ 3 t a^2,\n\n- (3/4) a^2,\n\n- 2 t a,\n\n+ t^2.\n\nNow, collect like terms:\n\na^4: -1 a^4.\n\na^3: +2t a^3.\n\na^2: (-4t\u00b2 + 1 + 3t - 3/4) a^2.\n\na: -2t a.\n\nConstants: +t^2.\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficients:\n\na^4: -1.\n\na^3: +2t.\n\na^2: (-4t\u00b2 + (1 - 3/4) + 3t) = (-4t\u00b2 + 1/4 + 3t).\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. The a^2 terms are:\n\n-4t\u00b2 a\u00b2 (from the -a\u00b2 t\u00b2 and -3a\u00b2 t\u00b2),\n\n+a\u00b2,\n\n+3t a\u00b2,\n\n-3/4 a\u00b2.\n\nSo, combining:\n\na\u00b2 (-4t\u00b2 + 1 + 3t - 3/4).\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n1 - 3/4 = 1/4.\n\nSo, a^2 terms: a\u00b2 (-4t\u00b2 + 3t + 1/4).\n\nSimilarly, a terms: -2t a.\n\nConstants: t^2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the equation becomes:\n\n- a^4 + 2t a^3 + (-4t\u00b2 + 3t + 1/4) a^2 - 2t a + t^2 = 0.\n\nThis is a quartic equation in a, which looks really complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of parametrizing a, I can think about the condition that C doesn't lie on any other PQ except AB. That is, for C to lie only on AB and no other PQ, the equation we derived earlier must have exactly one solution for a, which is a=1/2, corresponding to AB. So, perhaps the equation we derived has a double root at a=1/2, meaning that AB is the only PQ passing through C. Alternatively, maybe for C, the equation has no solution except a=1/2. Hmm, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the envelope of the family of lines F. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. Points on the envelope are touched by exactly one member of the family. So, perhaps C is a point on AB that lies on the envelope of F.\n\nWait, that might be the case. Because if C is only on AB and no other PQ, then it might lie on the envelope of F.\n\nSo, maybe I can find the envelope of the family of lines F, and then find where AB intersects this envelope. The intersection point would be C.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nThe family of lines F is given by y = (-sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a) x + sqrt(1 - a\u00b2), where a is a parameter between 0 and 1.\n\nTo find the envelope, I can use the method of solving for the envelope by eliminating the parameter a from the equation and its derivative with respect to a.\n\nSo, let's denote the equation of PQ as F(a, x, y) = y + (sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a) x - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) = 0.\n\nWait, no, the equation is y = (-sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a) x + sqrt(1 - a\u00b2). So, rearranged: y + (sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a) x - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) = 0. So, F(a, x, y) = y + (sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a) x - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) = 0.\n\nTo find the envelope, we can take the derivative of F with respect to a and set it equal to zero.\n\nCompute dF/da:\n\ndF/da = 0 + [ ( (1/(2 sqrt(1 - a\u00b2))) * (2a) ) / a - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a\u00b2 ] x - [ ( (1/(2 sqrt(1 - a\u00b2))) * 2a ) ] = 0.\n\nWait, let me compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, F(a, x, y) = y + (sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a) x - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) = 0.\n\nSo, dF/da is:\n\nd/da [ y ] + d/da [ (sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a) x ] - d/da [ sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ] = 0.\n\nSince y and x are variables, their derivatives with respect to a are zero.\n\nSo,\n\ndF/da = 0 + x * d/da [ sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a ] - d/da [ sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ] = 0.\n\nCompute each derivative:\n\nFirst, d/da [ sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a ]:\n\nLet me write this as (1 - a\u00b2)^(1/2) / a.\n\nUsing the quotient rule:\n\nLet u = (1 - a\u00b2)^(1/2), v = a.\n\ndu/da = (1/2)(1 - a\u00b2)^(-1/2) * (-2a) = -a / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2).\n\ndv/da = 1.\n\nSo,\n\nd/da [ u/v ] = (v du/da - u dv/da) / v\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n= [ a*(-a / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)) - (1 - a\u00b2)^(1/2)*1 ] / a\u00b2.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n= [ -a\u00b2 / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ].\n\nFactor sqrt(1 - a\u00b2):\n\n= [ (-a\u00b2 - (1 - a\u00b2)) / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ]\n\n= [ (-a\u00b2 -1 + a\u00b2) / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ]\n\n= (-1)/sqrt(1 - a\u00b2).\n\nSo, d/da [ sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a ] = (-1)/sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) * (1/a\u00b2).\n\nWait, no, because the denominator is v\u00b2 = a\u00b2. So,\n\nd/da [ sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a ] = [ (-a\u00b2 - (1 - a\u00b2)) / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ] / a\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me compute it again.\n\nd/da [ sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a ]:\n\n= [ ( -a / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ) * a - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) * 1 ] / a\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, the quotient rule is (v du - u dv)/v\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nv = a,\n\nu = sqrt(1 - a\u00b2),\n\ndu/da = (-a)/sqrt(1 - a\u00b2),\n\ndv/da = 1.\n\nSo,\n\n(v du - u dv)/v\u00b2 = [ a*(-a)/sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)*1 ] / a\u00b2.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n= [ (-a\u00b2)/sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ].\n\nFactor sqrt(1 - a\u00b2):\n\n= [ (-a\u00b2 - (1 - a\u00b2)) / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ]\n\n= [ (-a\u00b2 -1 + a\u00b2) / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ]\n\n= (-1)/sqrt(1 - a\u00b2).\n\nSo, numerator is (-1)/sqrt(1 - a\u00b2), denominator is a\u00b2.\n\nSo, d/da [ sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a ] = (-1)/sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) / a\u00b2 = -1/(a\u00b2 sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)).\n\nNow, the second derivative is d/da [ sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ].\n\nWhich is (1/2)(1 - a\u00b2)^(-1/2) * (-2a) = -a / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2).\n\nPutting it all together, dF/da is:\n\nx * [ -1/(a\u00b2 sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)) ] - [ -a / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) ] = 0.\n\nSo,\n\n- x/(a\u00b2 sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)) + a / sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(1 - a\u00b2):\n\n- x/(a\u00b2) + a = 0.\n\nSo,\n\na = x/(a\u00b2).\n\nMultiply both sides by a\u00b2:\n\na^3 = x.\n\nSo, from the envelope condition, we get a = cube root of x.\n\nWait, that seems interesting. So, a = x^{1/3}.\n\nWait, but let me check that step again.\n\nFrom the equation:\n\n- x/(a\u00b2) + a = 0.\n\nSo,\n\na = x/(a\u00b2).\n\nMultiply both sides by a\u00b2:\n\na^3 = x.\n\nSo, a = x^{1/3}.\n\nSo, now, substituting back into F(a, x, y) = 0.\n\nF(a, x, y) = y + (sqrt(1 - a\u00b2)/a) x - sqrt(1 - a\u00b2) = 0.\n\nBut since a = x^{1/3}, let's substitute a = x^{1/3}.\n\nSo,\n\ny + (sqrt(1 - (x^{1/3})^2)/x^{1/3}) * x - sqrt(1 - (x^{1/3})^2) = 0.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nsqrt(1 - x^{2/3}) / x^{1/3} * x = sqrt(1 - x^{2/3}) * x^{2/3}.\n\nBecause x / x^{1/3} = x^{1 - 1/3} = x^{2/3}.\n\nSo,\n\ny + sqrt(1 - x^{2/3}) * x^{2/3} - sqrt(1 - x^{2/3}) = 0.\n\nFactor sqrt(1 - x^{2/3}):\n\ny + sqrt(1 - x^{2/3}) (x^{2/3} - 1) = 0.\n\nSo,\n\ny = sqrt(1 - x^{2/3}) (1 - x^{2/3}).\n\nBecause (x^{2/3} - 1) = -(1 - x^{2/3}).\n\nSo,\n\ny = sqrt(1 - x^{2/3}) * (1 - x^{2/3}).\n\nWhich is,\n\ny = (1 - x^{2/3})^{3/2}.\n\nSo, the envelope of the family F is the curve y = (1 - x^{2/3})^{3/2}.\n\nHmm, that's an interesting curve. Now, the point C lies on AB and on the envelope, so it must satisfy both equations: the equation of AB and the envelope.\n\nSo, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nThe envelope is y = (1 - x^{2/3})^{3/2}.\n\nSo, we can set these equal to each other:\n\n-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 = (1 - x^{2/3})^{3/2}.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nsqrt(3)(-x + 1/2) = (1 - x^{2/3})^{3/2}.\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root on the right:\n\n[ sqrt(3)(-x + 1/2) ]^2 = [ (1 - x^{2/3})^{3/2} ]^2.\n\nSo,\n\n3*(-x + 1/2)^2 = (1 - x^{2/3})^3.\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side:\n\n3*(x^2 - x + 1/4).\n\nRight side:\n\n(1 - x^{2/3})^3.\n\nExpanding the right side using binomial expansion:\n\n= 1^3 - 3*1^2*x^{2/3} + 3*1*(x^{2/3})^2 - (x^{2/3})^3.\n\n= 1 - 3x^{2/3} + 3x^{4/3} - x^2.\n\nSo, left side is 3x\u00b2 - 3x + 3/4.\n\nRight side is 1 - 3x^{2/3} + 3x^{4/3} - x\u00b2.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n3x\u00b2 -3x + 3/4 -1 +3x^{2/3} -3x^{4/3} +x\u00b2 = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3x\u00b2 + x\u00b2 =4x\u00b2,\n\n-3x,\n\n3/4 -1 = -1/4,\n\n+3x^{2/3},\n\n-3x^{4/3}.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n4x\u00b2 -3x -1/4 +3x^{2/3} -3x^{4/3} =0.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can make a substitution.\n\nLet me let u = x^{1/3}, so that x = u^3.\n\nThen, x^{2/3} = u^2,\n\nx^{4/3} = u^4,\n\nx\u00b2 = u^6.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n4u^6 -3u^3 -1/4 +3u^2 -3u^4 =0.\n\nLet me write the terms in order of descending powers of u:\n\n4u^6 -3u^4 +3u^2 -3u^3 -1/4 =0.\n\nWait, maybe I should arrange them:\n\n4u^6 -3u^4 -3u^3 +3u^2 -1/4 =0.\n\nThis is a sixth-degree polynomial, which looks difficult to solve. Maybe I can factor it.\n\nLet me try to factor this equation.\n\nPerhaps I can look for rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term over factors of the leading coefficient. The constant term is -1/4, and leading coefficient is 4. So possible roots are \u00b11, \u00b11/2, \u00b11/4, etc., but let me test u=1/2.\n\nSubstitute u=1/2:\n\n4*(1/2)^6 -3*(1/2)^4 -3*(1/2)^3 +3*(1/2)^2 -1/4.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4*(1/64) = 4/64=1/16,\n\n-3*(1/16)= -3/16,\n\n-3*(1/8)= -3/8,\n\n3*(1/4)=3/4,\n\n-1/4.\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n1/16 -3/16 -3/8 +3/4 -1/4.\n\nConvert to 16 denominators:\n\n1/16 - 3/16 -6/16 +12/16 -4/16.\n\nTotal: (1 -3 -6 +12 -4)/16 = (0)/16 = 0.\n\nSo, u=1/2 is a root. So, (u - 1/2) is a factor.\n\nNow, let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out (u - 1/2).\n\nLet me write the polynomial as:\n\n4u^6 -3u^4 -3u^3 +3u^2 -1/4.\n\nWait, but when I tested u=1/2, it worked. So, let's perform synthetic division.\n\nBut the polynomial is:\n\n4u^6 + 0u^5 -3u^4 -3u^3 +3u^2 +0u -1/4.\n\nWait, actually, the original substitution gives:\n\n4u^6 -3u^4 -3u^3 +3u^2 -1/4.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write all degrees:\n\n4u^6 +0u^5 -3u^4 -3u^3 +3u^2 +0u -1/4.\n\nDivided by (u - 1/2).\n\nUsing synthetic division for u=1/2.\n\nThe coefficients are:\n\n4, 0, -3, -3, 3, 0, -1/4.\n\nBring down the 4.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: 4*(1/2)=2.\n\nAdd to next coefficient: 0+2=2.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: 2*(1/2)=1.\n\nAdd to next coefficient: -3 +1= -2.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: -2*(1/2)=-1.\n\nAdd to next coefficient: -3 + (-1)= -4.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: -4*(1/2)=-2.\n\nAdd to next coefficient:3 + (-2)=1.\n\nMultiply by 1/2:1*(1/2)=1/2.\n\nAdd to next coefficient:0 +1/2=1/2.\n\nMultiply by1/2: (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4.\n\nAdd to last coefficient: (-1/4) +1/4=0.\n\nSo, the result is:\n\n4u^5 +2u^4 -2u^3 -4u^2 +u +1/2.\n\nSo, the polynomial factors as (u -1/2)(4u^5 +2u^4 -2u^3 -4u^2 +u +1/2).\n\nHmm, now I need to find other roots. Maybe u=1/2 is a repeated root?\n\nLet me test u=1/2 again in the new polynomial:\n\n4*(1/2)^5 +2*(1/2)^4 -2*(1/2)^3 -4*(1/2)^2 + (1/2) +1/2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4*(1/32)=4/32=1/8,\n\n2*(1/16)=2/16=1/8,\n\n-2*(1/8)= -1/4,\n\n-4*(1/4)= -1,\n\n1/2,\n\n1/2.\n\nSum: 1/8 +1/8=1/4; -1/4; so 1/4 -1/4=0.\n\nThen, -1 +1/2 +1/2= -1 +1=0.\n\nSo, u=1/2 is a root again. So, (u -1/2)^2 is a factor.\n\nLet me perform synthetic division again on the quintic polynomial.\n\nThe quintic coefficients are:\n\n4, 2, -2, -4, 1, 1/2.\n\nDivided by (u -1/2).\n\nUsing synthetic division with u=1/2.\n\nBring down 4.\n\nMultiply by 1/2:4*(1/2)=2.\n\nAdd to next coefficient:2 +2=4.\n\nMultiply by1/2:4*(1/2)=2.\n\nAdd to next coefficient:-2 +2=0.\n\nMultiply by1/2:0*(1/2)=0.\n\nAdd to next coefficient:-4 +0=-4.\n\nMultiply by1/2:-4*(1/2)=-2.\n\nAdd to next coefficient:1 + (-2)=-1.\n\nMultiply by1/2:-1*(1/2)=-1/2.\n\nAdd to last coefficient:1/2 + (-1/2)=0.\n\nSo, the quintic factors into (u -1/2)(4u^4 +4u^3 +0u^2 -4u -1).\n\nSo, the original polynomial is now (u -1/2)^2*(4u^4 +4u^3 -4u -1).\n\nNow, let me try to factor 4u^4 +4u^3 -4u -1.\n\nPerhaps I can factor by grouping.\n\nGroup terms:\n\n(4u^4 +4u^3) + (-4u -1).\n\nFactor 4u^3 from the first group: 4u^3(u +1).\n\nFactor -1 from the second group: -1*(4u +1).\n\nHmm, but that doesn't seem to help. Alternatively, maybe try to factor as a product of quadratics.\n\nAssume it factors into (au\u00b2 + bu +c)(du\u00b2 + eu +f).\n\nMultiply them:\n\nad u^4 + (ae + bd)u^3 + (af + be + cd)u^2 + (bf + ce)u + cf.\n\nCompare to 4u^4 +4u^3 +0u^2 -4u -1.\n\nSo,\n\nad =4,\n\nae + bd=4,\n\naf + be + cd=0,\n\nbf + ce= -4,\n\ncf= -1.\n\nLooking for integer coefficients, perhaps.\n\nSince cf=-1, possible options are c=1, f=-1 or c=-1, f=1.\n\nLet me try c=1, f=-1.\n\nThen,\n\nad=4. Let's try a=4, d=1.\n\nSo, a=4, d=1, c=1, f=-1.\n\nNow,\n\nae + bd=4* e + b*1=4e +b=4.\n\nNext,\n\naf + be + cd=4*(-1) +b*e +1*1= -4 +b e +1= -3 +b e=0 \u21d2 b e=3.\n\nAnd,\n\nbf + ce= b*(-1) + e*1= -b + e= -4.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1. 4e + b =4.\n\n2. b e=3.\n\n3. -b + e= -4.\n\nLet me try to solve these equations.\n\nFrom equation 3: e = b -4.\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\n4*(b -4) + b=4 \u21d24b -16 +b=4 \u21d25b=20 \u21d2b=4.\n\nThen, e=4 -4=0.\n\nBut then equation 2: b e=4*0=0 \u22603. So, no solution.\n\nNext, try a=2, d=2.\n\na=2, d=2.\n\nThen,\n\nae + bd=2e +2b=4.\n\nAnd,\n\naf + be + cd=2*(-1) +b e +2*1= -2 +b e +2= b e=0 \u21d2b e=0.\n\nBut from equation 2, we have b e=3, which is impossible. So, no solution.\n\nNext, try a=1, d=4.\n\nThen,\n\nae + bd=1*e +b*4= e +4b=4.\n\nFrom equation 3:\n\n-b + e= -4 \u21d2e= b -4.\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\n(b -4) +4b=4 \u21d25b -4=4 \u21d25b=8 \u21d2b=8/5, which is not integer. So, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, try a=4, d=1 as before but with c=-1, f=1.\n\nSo, a=4, d=1, c=-1, f=1.\n\nThen,\n\nae + bd=4e +b=4.\n\naf + be + cd=4*1 +b e + (-1)*1=4 +b e -1=3 +b e=0 \u21d2b e= -3.\n\nbf + ce= b*1 + e*(-1)=b -e= -4.\n\nSo,\n\nFrom equation 3: b - e= -4 \u21d2e= b +4.\n\nFrom equation 1:4e +b=4 \u21d24*(b+4) +b=4 \u21d24b +16 +b=4 \u21d25b= -12 \u21d2b= -12/5, which is not integer. So, no solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a= -2, d=-2.\n\nBut maybe this approach isn't working. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me try to see if 4u^4 +4u^3 -4u -1 has any rational roots.\n\nPossible roots are \u00b11, \u00b11/2, \u00b11/4.\n\nTest u=1: 4 +4 -4 -1=3\u22600.\n\nu=-1:4*(-1)^4 +4*(-1)^3 -4*(-1) -1=4 -4 +4 -1=3\u22600.\n\nu=1/2:4*(1/2)^4 +4*(1/2)^3 -4*(1/2) -1=4*(1/16)+4*(1/8) -2 -1=1/4 +1/2 -3= (1 + 2)/4 -3= 3/4 -3= -9/4 \u22600.\n\nu=-1/2:4*(1/16)+4*(-1/8) -4*(-1/2) -1= 1/4 - 1/2 +2 -1= (1/4 -1/2) +1= (-1/4) +1= 3/4 \u22600.\n\nu=1/4:4*(1/256) +4*(1/64) -4*(1/4) -1= 1/64 + 1/16 -1 -1= (1 +4)/64 -2=5/64 -2= -117/64 \u22600.\n\nSo, no rational roots. So, maybe it's irreducible. Therefore, perhaps the only real roots are u=1/2 (with multiplicity 2) and others are complex. So, in the real numbers, the only solution is u=1/2.\n\nSo, going back, the only real solution for u is 1/2. Therefore, x= u^3= (1/2)^3=1/8.\n\nSo, x=1/8.\n\nNow, substitute x=1/8 into the envelope equation to find y.\n\nFrom the envelope: y = (1 - x^{2/3})^{3/2}.\n\nx^{2/3}= (1/8)^{2/3}= (1/8)^{1/3 * 2}= (1/2)^{2}=1/4.\n\nSo,\n\ny= (1 - 1/4)^{3/2}= (3/4)^{3/2}= (sqrt(3/4))^3= (sqrt(3)/2)^3= (3*sqrt(3))/8.\n\nWait, but wait: (3/4)^{3/2}= (sqrt(3/4))^3= (sqrt(3)/2)^3= (3*sqrt(3))/8. So, yes.\n\nSo, point C is at (1/8, 3\u221a3/8).\n\nBut wait, we need to check if this point lies on AB.\n\nThe equation of AB is y= -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAt x=1/8,\n\ny= -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2= (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8)= (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nWhich matches the y-coordinate from the envelope. So, yes, C is at (1/8, 3\u221a3/8).\n\nSo, now, we need to compute OC\u00b2, where O is (0,0).\n\nOC\u00b2= (1/8)^2 + (3\u221a3/8)^2= 1/64 + (27)/64= (1 +27)/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nSo, OC\u00b2=7/16.\n\nThus, p=7, q=16, and p+q=23.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 7 and 16 are coprime, yes.\n\nSo, the answer is 23.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding a unique point \\( C \\) on segment \\( \\overline{AB} \\) that does not lie on any other segment from the family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) except \\( \\overline{AB} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Alright, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These points form a triangle, I think. The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each PQ is like a line segment from some point P(p, 0) to Q(0, q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the distance between P and Q is 1. \n\nThe problem says there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that isn't on any of these PQ segments except AB itself. We need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, then find p + q.\n\nFirst, I should probably find the equation of line AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), let's find the slope of AB. The slope m is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the slope is -sqrt(3).\n\nUsing point-slope form, the equation of AB can be written as y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplifying that, y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2). So any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nNow, the family F consists of segments PQ where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, with PQ length 1. So for any such segment, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), and sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. So p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nI need to find point C on AB such that it's only on AB and no other PQ from F. That means, for point C, if I take any other segment PQ in F, C shouldn't lie on PQ. So we need to find C such that it's not on any PQ except AB.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the envelope of all these segments PQ. The envelope is the set of points that are on exactly one segment from F. So perhaps point C is a point where the envelope intersects AB. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, for a point C on AB, the condition is that it doesn't lie on any PQ other than AB. So, for point C, the only PQ in F that passes through it is AB itself. So, we need to find point C such that if we draw any other segment PQ from F, it doesn't pass through C.\n\nWait, but AB is one of the PQ segments in F, right? Because if P is at A (1/2, 0) and Q is at B (0, sqrt(3)/2), then the distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt(1) = 1. So AB is indeed a segment in F.\n\nSo, the point C is on AB but not on any other PQ in F. So, for C, we need that for any other PQ in F (i.e., for any other (p, q) with p^2 + q^2 = 1), the point C does not lie on the segment PQ.\n\nSo, to rephrase, we need to find C on AB such that it's not on any other PQ except AB.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parameterize point C on AB and then find conditions where it doesn't lie on any other PQ.\n\nLet me parameterize AB. Since AB goes from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), let's use a parameter t where t=0 is at A and t=1 is at B. So, the parametric equations are x = 1/2 - (1/2)t, y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t, where t ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSo, point C can be written as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2)t ) for t in [0,1].\n\nNow, suppose another segment PQ in F, where P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), with p^2 + q^2 = 1. The equation of PQ can be written as (x/p) + (y/q) = 1.\n\nSo, if point C lies on PQ, then substituting C's coordinates into this equation should satisfy it:\n\n( (1/2)(1 - t) ) / p + ( (sqrt(3)/2 t ) ) / q = 1.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(1 - t)/(2p) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2 q) = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n(1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2.\n\nBut since p^2 + q^2 = 1, we have q = sqrt(1 - p^2). Wait, but p and q are positive since we are in the first quadrant. So, q = sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nBut maybe it's better to express everything in terms of p, given that q = sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nSo, substituting q:\n\n(1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 2.\n\nWe can think of this as an equation relating p and t. For a given t, if there exists a p in (0,1) such that this equation holds, then point C is on PQ for that p. But we want point C such that this equation does not hold for any p except when PQ is AB itself.\n\nWait, but AB is one such PQ where p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2, so substituting p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2 into the equation, let's see:\n\n(1 - t)/(1/2) + (sqrt(3) t)/(sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(1 - t) + (2 t) = 2 - 2t + 2t = 2. So it holds for any t. Which makes sense because C is on AB, which is PQ with p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nBut for other p, we don't want any t (except the one corresponding to AB) to satisfy the equation.\n\nSo, we can think of for point C, there should be no solution p in (0,1) \\ {1/2} such that (1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 2.\n\nAlternatively, for each p in (0,1) \\ {1/2}, the equation above should have no solution t.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to think about the point C being the unique intersection point of AB with the envelope of all such PQ segments.\n\nThe envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, in this case, the envelope would be a curve that touches each PQ segment at exactly one point. So, the point C where AB intersects the envelope would be the point where AB is tangent to the envelope, meaning that C is the only point on AB that lies on any PQ except AB itself.\n\nTherefore, perhaps we can find the envelope of the family F and find its intersection with AB. That intersection point would be C.\n\nSo, let's try to find the envelope of the family F.\n\nThe family F consists of lines (x/p) + (y/q) = 1, with p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nTo find the envelope, we can use the method of solving for the envelope of a family of curves. For a family of curves F(p) = (x/p) + (y/q) - 1 = 0, with the condition G(p, q) = p^2 + q^2 - 1 = 0.\n\nThe envelope satisfies both F(p) = 0 and dF/dp = 0.\n\nSo, compute dF/dp:\n\ndF/dp = -x/p^2 + 0 - 0 = -x/p^2.\n\nSet dF/dp = 0:\n\n-x/p^2 = 0 => x = 0.\n\nBut x=0 would imply that point is on the y-axis, but we are in the first quadrant, so x can't be zero except at O. But O is (0,0), which is a corner point, so maybe not. Hmm, perhaps this approach is leading me astray.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should parameterize the family differently.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that for each p, we have a line. The envelope is the set of points where each point is on exactly one line of the family, and the line is tangent to the envelope at that point.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parametrize the lines in terms of p, and then find the envelope by solving F(p) = 0 and dF/dp = 0.\n\nWait, let's try that again.\n\nGiven F(p) = x/p + y/q - 1 = 0, with q = sqrt(1 - p^2). So F(p) = x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) - 1 = 0.\n\nCompute dF/dp:\n\ndF/dp = -x/p^2 + (y * (1/(2 sqrt(1 - p^2))) ) * (2p) ) = -x/p^2 + (y p)/sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nSet dF/dp = 0:\n\n-x/p^2 + (y p)/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 0.\n\nSo, (y p)/sqrt(1 - p^2) = x/p^2.\n\nMultiply both sides by p^2 sqrt(1 - p^2):\n\ny p^3 = x (1 - p^2).\n\nSo, y p^3 + x p^2 - x = 0.\n\nBut from F(p) = 0, we have x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1. Let's denote this as equation (1), and the derivative condition as equation (2):\n\nEquation (1): x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.\n\nEquation (2): y p^3 + x p^2 - x = 0.\n\nSo, we have two equations with variables x, y, and parameter p.\n\nLet me try to solve these equations.\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\ny p^3 = x (1 - p^2).\n\nSo, y = [x (1 - p^2)] / p^3.\n\nSubstitute this into equation (1):\n\nx/p + [x (1 - p^2) / p^3] / sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\n[x (1 - p^2) ] / (p^3 sqrt(1 - p^2)) ) = x sqrt(1 - p^2) / p^3.\n\nSo, equation (1) becomes:\n\nx/p + x sqrt(1 - p^2) / p^3 = 1.\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx [ 1/p + sqrt(1 - p^2)/p^3 ] = 1.\n\nLet me compute the expression in the brackets:\n\n1/p + sqrt(1 - p^2)/p^3 = [ p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2) ] / p^3.\n\nSo, equation (1) becomes:\n\nx [ (p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2)) / p^3 ] = 1.\n\nThus,\n\nx = p^3 / (p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2)).\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe we can square both sides to eliminate the square root, but it might get messy.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that point (x, y) lies on the envelope, so we can express x and y in terms of p.\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\ny = [x (1 - p^2)] / p^3.\n\nSo, if I can express x in terms of p, I can then write y in terms of p.\n\nFrom above, x = p^3 / (p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2)).\n\nLet me compute sqrt(1 - p^2). Let's denote s = sqrt(1 - p^2), so s = sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nThen, x = p^3 / (p^2 + s).\n\nSimilarly, y = [x (1 - p^2)] / p^3 = [x s^2 ] / p^3.\n\nSubstituting x:\n\ny = [ (p^3 / (p^2 + s)) * s^2 ] / p^3 = [ s^2 / (p^2 + s) ].\n\nSo, y = s^2 / (p^2 + s).\n\nNow, let me try to find a relation between x and y without p.\n\nWe have:\n\nx = p^3 / (p^2 + s).\n\ny = s^2 / (p^2 + s).\n\nSo, both x and y have denominators of (p^2 + s). Let me denote D = p^2 + s.\n\nThen,\n\nx = p^3 / D,\n\ny = s^2 / D.\n\nLet me compute x * y:\n\nx y = (p^3 s^2) / D^2.\n\nBut D = p^2 + s, so D^2 = (p^2 + s)^2.\n\nAlso, s = sqrt(1 - p^2), so s^2 = 1 - p^2.\n\nSo, x y = (p^3 (1 - p^2)) / (p^2 + s)^2.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe let's find expressions for p and s in terms of x and y.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if we can find a relation between x and y.\n\nWe have:\n\nFrom x = p^3 / D,\n\nand y = s^2 / D.\n\nLet me denote D = p^2 + s.\n\nSo, x D = p^3,\n\ny D = s^2.\n\nSo, from x D = p^3,\n\np^3 = x D,\n\nSimilarly, s^2 = y D.\n\nBut s = sqrt(1 - p^2), so s^2 = 1 - p^2 = y D.\n\nSo,\n\n1 - p^2 = y D.\n\nBut D = p^2 + s, and s = sqrt(1 - p^2) = sqrt(y D).\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since we know that point C is on AB, whose equation is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, point C is (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting this into the envelope equations.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to parameterize point C on AB as we did earlier: C = ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ).\n\nSo, x = (1 - t)/2,\n\ny = (sqrt(3) t)/2.\n\nNow, substitute these into the equation of the envelope.\n\nFrom the envelope, we have x = p^3 / (p^2 + s) and y = s^2 / (p^2 + s), where s = sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nSo, substituting x and y:\n\n(1 - t)/2 = p^3 / (p^2 + s),\n\n(sqrt(3) t)/2 = s^2 / (p^2 + s).\n\nLet me denote D = p^2 + s.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 - t)/2 = p^3 / D,\n\n(sqrt(3) t)/2 = s^2 / D.\n\nFrom the first equation: D = 2 p^3 / (1 - t).\n\nFrom the second equation: D = 2 s^2 / (sqrt(3) t).\n\nSo, setting them equal:\n\n2 p^3 / (1 - t) = 2 s^2 / (sqrt(3) t).\n\nCancel the 2's:\n\np^3 / (1 - t) = s^2 / (sqrt(3) t).\n\nBut s = sqrt(1 - p^2), so s^2 = 1 - p^2.\n\nSo,\n\np^3 / (1 - t) = (1 - p^2) / (sqrt(3) t).\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\np^3 * sqrt(3) t = (1 - p^2)(1 - t).\n\nLet me expand the right-hand side:\n\n(1 - p^2)(1 - t) = (1 - p^2) - (1 - p^2) t.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 t = (1 - p^2) - (1 - p^2) t.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 t + (1 - p^2) t - (1 - p^2) = 0.\n\nFactor t:\n\nt [ sqrt(3) p^3 + (1 - p^2) ] - (1 - p^2) = 0.\n\nSolve for t:\n\nt = (1 - p^2) / [ sqrt(3) p^3 + (1 - p^2) ].\n\nBut we also have from the parametric equations of point C:\n\nx = (1 - t)/2,\n\ny = (sqrt(3) t)/2.\n\nSo, we can express t in terms of x and y, but perhaps it's better to relate t and p.\n\nAlternatively, from the parametric equations, t can be expressed in terms of x:\n\nx = (1 - t)/2 => 1 - t = 2x => t = 1 - 2x.\n\nSimilarly, y = (sqrt(3)/2) t => t = (2 y)/sqrt(3).\n\nSo, setting the two expressions for t equal:\n\n1 - 2x = (2 y)/sqrt(3).\n\nBut since y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2, substitute that in:\n\n1 - 2x = (2 (-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 )) / sqrt(3).\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n[ -2 sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) ] / sqrt(3) = (-2x) + 1.\n\nSo,\n\n1 - 2x = -2x + 1.\n\nWhich simplifies to 1 - 2x = 1 - 2x. So, this doesn't give us new information; it's just an identity, which makes sense because t is consistent with the parametric equations.\n\nHmm, maybe I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, since point C is on both AB and the envelope, which is the set of points where each is on exactly one PQ. So, perhaps the envelope is a curve, and AB intersects this envelope at point C.\n\nSo, the envelope equation can be found by eliminating p from the two equations:\n\n1. x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.\n\n2. -x/p^2 + (y p)/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 0.\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nFrom equation (2), we had y p^3 + x p^2 - x = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps we can express y in terms of x and p, and then substitute into equation (1).\n\nFrom equation (2): y = (x (1 - p^2)) / p^3.\n\nSubstitute into equation (1):\n\nx/p + [ (x (1 - p^2) ) / p^3 ] / sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx/p + x sqrt(1 - p^2) / p^3 = 1.\n\nFactor x:\n\nx [ 1/p + sqrt(1 - p^2)/p^3 ] = 1.\n\nSo,\n\nx = 1 / [ 1/p + sqrt(1 - p^2)/p^3 ].\n\nLet me compute the denominator:\n\n1/p + sqrt(1 - p^2)/p^3 = (p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2)) / p^3.\n\nSo,\n\nx = p^3 / (p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2)).\n\nSimilarly, from equation (2), y = x (1 - p^2)/p^3.\n\nSo, y = [ p^3 / (p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2)) ] * (1 - p^2)/p^3 = (1 - p^2)/(p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2)).\n\nSo, now we have x and y in terms of p:\n\nx = p^3 / (p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2)),\n\ny = (1 - p^2) / (p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2)).\n\nLet me denote sqrt(1 - p^2) as s for simplicity. So, s = sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nThen,\n\nx = p^3 / (p^2 + s),\n\ny = (s^2) / (p^2 + s).\n\nSo, from these, we can write:\n\nx = p^3 / (p^2 + s),\n\ny = s^2 / (p^2 + s).\n\nLet me compute x + y:\n\nx + y = (p^3 + s^2) / (p^2 + s).\n\nBut s^2 = 1 - p^2, so:\n\nx + y = (p^3 + 1 - p^2) / (p^2 + s).\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express y in terms of x.\n\nFrom x = p^3 / (p^2 + s),\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (p^2 - s):\n\nx = p^3 (p^2 - s) / [ (p^2 + s)(p^2 - s) ].\n\nDenominator becomes p^4 - s^2 = p^4 - (1 - p^2) = p^4 + p^2 -1.\n\nHmm, maybe that's not useful.\n\nAlternatively, square both sides to eliminate the square root.\n\nFrom x = p^3 / (p^2 + s),\n\nMultiply both sides by (p^2 + s):\n\nx (p^2 + s) = p^3.\n\nSo,\n\nx p^2 + x s = p^3.\n\nSimilarly, from y = s^2 / (p^2 + s),\n\nMultiply both sides by (p^2 + s):\n\ny (p^2 + s) = s^2.\n\nSo,\n\ny p^2 + y s = s^2.\n\nNow, from the first equation, x p^2 + x s = p^3.\n\nLet me write s from the first equation:\n\nx s = p^3 - x p^2.\n\nSo,\n\ns = (p^3 - x p^2) / x.\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation:\n\ny p^2 + y s = s^2.\n\nSubstitute s from the first equation into the second:\n\ny p^2 + y * [ (p^3 - x p^2) / x ] = [ (p^3 - x p^2) / x ]^2.\n\nSimplify each term.\n\nLeft-hand side:\n\ny p^2 + [ y (p^3 - x p^2) ] / x.\n\nRight-hand side:\n\n( p^3 - x p^2 )^2 / x^2.\n\nLet me compute the left-hand side:\n\nFactor y p^2:\n\ny p^2 [ 1 + (p^3 - x p^2)/x ].\n\nWait, that might not be helpful. Let me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: y p^2.\n\nSecond term: [ y (p^3 - x p^2) ] / x = y p^2 (p - x)/x.\n\nSo, left-hand side becomes:\n\ny p^2 + y p^2 (p - x)/x = y p^2 [ 1 + (p - x)/x ].\n\nSimplify the bracket:\n\n1 + (p - x)/x = (x + p - x)/x = p/x.\n\nSo, left-hand side is y p^2 * (p / x ) = y p^3 / x.\n\nRight-hand side is ( p^3 - x p^2 )^2 / x^2.\n\nSo,\n\ny p^3 / x = ( p^3 - x p^2 )^2 / x^2.\n\nMultiply both sides by x^2:\n\ny p^3 x = ( p^3 - x p^2 )^2.\n\nLet me expand the right-hand side:\n\n( p^3 - x p^2 )^2 = p^6 - 2 x p^5 + x^2 p^4.\n\nSo,\n\ny p^3 x = p^6 - 2 x p^5 + x^2 p^4.\n\nDivide both sides by p^3 (assuming p \u2260 0):\n\ny x = p^3 - 2 x p^2 + x^2 p.\n\nSo,\n\ny x = p^3 - 2 x p^2 + x^2 p.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\np^3 - (2 x) p^2 + (x^2) p - x y = 0.\n\nThis is a cubic equation in p. Hmm, complicated.\n\nBut we also know that point C is on AB, which has equation y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSubstitute this into the equation:\n\np^3 - 2x p^2 + x^2 p - x (-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ) = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\np^3 - 2x p^2 + x^2 p + sqrt(3) x^2 - (sqrt(3)/2) x = 0.\n\nSo,\n\np^3 - 2x p^2 + x^2 p + sqrt(3) x^2 - (sqrt(3)/2) x = 0.\n\nThis is a cubic equation in p, but it's quite involved. I'm not sure if this is the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the parametric expressions for x and y in terms of p, and since point C is on AB, we can find p such that (x, y) lies on AB.\n\nSo, from the parametric expressions:\n\nx = p^3 / (p^2 + s),\n\ny = s^2 / (p^2 + s),\n\nand since y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nwe can substitute:\n\ns^2 / (p^2 + s) = -sqrt(3) [ p^3 / (p^2 + s) ] + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by (p^2 + s):\n\ns^2 = -sqrt(3) p^3 + (sqrt(3)/2)(p^2 + s).\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\ns^2 + sqrt(3) p^3 - (sqrt(3)/2)(p^2 + s) = 0.\n\nBut s = sqrt(1 - p^2), so s^2 = 1 - p^2.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n1 - p^2 + sqrt(3) p^3 - (sqrt(3)/2)(p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2)) = 0.\n\nLet me write this out:\n\n1 - p^2 + sqrt(3) p^3 - (sqrt(3)/2) p^2 - (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - p^2) = 0.\n\nThis looks complicated, but maybe we can rearrange terms:\n\n[ sqrt(3) p^3 ] + [ -p^2 - (sqrt(3)/2) p^2 ] + [ 1 ] - [ (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - p^2) ] = 0.\n\nFactor terms:\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 + [ -1 - sqrt(3)/2 ] p^2 + 1 - (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - p^2) = 0.\n\nThis is a transcendental equation in p, which might be difficult to solve analytically. Maybe we can make a substitution or find a clever way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that point C is the centroid of triangle OAB. But let's compute the centroid. The centroid would be at ( (0 + 1/2 + 0)/3, (0 + 0 + sqrt(3)/2)/3 ) = (1/6, sqrt(3)/6 ). Let's see if this point satisfies the condition of lying only on AB.\n\nBut wait, the centroid is not necessarily the point we're looking for. Let me compute OC^2 for centroid: (1/6)^2 + (sqrt(3)/6)^2 = 1/36 + 3/36 = 4/36 = 1/9. But 1/9 is 1/9, which is p + q = 1 + 9 = 10. But I'm not sure if this is the correct point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is the foot of the perpendicular from O to AB. Let me compute that.\n\nThe line AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nThe slope is -sqrt(3), so the perpendicular has slope 1/sqrt(3).\n\nThe equation of the perpendicular from O is y = (1/sqrt(3)) x.\n\nFind intersection point between y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 and y = (1/sqrt(3)) x.\n\nSet equal:\n\n(1/sqrt(3)) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n1 * x = -3 x + (3)/2.\n\nSo,\n\nx + 3x = 3/2.\n\n4x = 3/2 => x = 3/8.\n\nThen y = (1/sqrt(3))(3/8) = sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo, the foot is at (3/8, sqrt(3)/8). Then OC^2 is (3/8)^2 + (sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 9/64 + 3/64 = 12/64 = 3/16. So, 3 + 16 = 19. But I don't know if this is the point we're looking for.\n\nWait, but the problem states that point C is on AB and not on any other PQ except AB. So, perhaps the foot of the perpendicular is the point where all PQ segments are closest to O, but I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using optimization: find the minimal distance from O to a segment PQ, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: For each PQ segment, the equation is x/p + y/q = 1, with p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nIf a point C(x, y) is on AB and not on any other PQ, then for all other (p, q) \u2260 (1/2, sqrt(3)/2), the equation x/p + y/q \u2260 1.\n\nBut since C is on AB, which is one such PQ, we have x/(1/2) + y/(sqrt(3)/2) = 1.\n\nWhich simplifies to 2x + (2 y)/sqrt(3) = 1.\n\nWhich is the equation of AB, as we had earlier.\n\nSo, for other p and q, we need that x/p + y/q \u2260 1.\n\nSo, the point C is such that when you plug it into x/p + y/q, it's equal to 1 only when p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, for point C on AB, we have x = (1 - t)/2, y = (sqrt(3) t)/2.\n\nSo, substituting into x/p + y/q = 1:\n\n( (1 - t)/2 ) / p + ( (sqrt(3) t)/2 ) / q = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n(1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2.\n\nBut we also have p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nSo, for point C, the above equation should hold only when p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWhich it does, as we saw earlier.\n\nBut for any other p and q with p^2 + q^2 =1, the equation (1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q \u2260 2.\n\nSo, perhaps for point C, this equation has no solution for p \u22601/2.\n\nWait, but t is determined by the position of C on AB. So, for a given C, t is fixed.\n\nSo, for a given C, we can think of the equation (1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2, with p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nWe need that this equation has no solution (p, q) other than p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, perhaps for the point C, the equation (1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2 has only one solution, which is p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, to ensure that, we can set up the equation and find conditions such that it only holds for p=1/2.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of this as a system of equations:\n\n(1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2,\n\np^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nWe can solve this system and find for which t there's only one solution (p, q), which would be when the system is tangent, meaning discriminant is zero.\n\nSo, let's solve for p and q.\n\nExpress q from the first equation:\n\n(1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n(1 - t)/p = 2 - (sqrt(3) t)/q.\n\nMultiply both sides by p q:\n\n(1 - t) q = 2 p q - sqrt(3) t p.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n(1 - t) q - 2 p q + sqrt(3) t p = 0.\n\nFactor terms:\n\nq [ (1 - t) - 2 p ] + sqrt(3) t p = 0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, express q from the first equation:\n\nLet me write the first equation as:\n\n(1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2.\n\nMultiply both sides by p q:\n\n(1 - t) q + sqrt(3) t p = 2 p q.\n\nRearrange:\n\n(1 - t) q - 2 p q + sqrt(3) t p = 0.\n\nFactor q:\n\nq [ (1 - t) - 2 p ] + sqrt(3) t p = 0.\n\nHmm, still complicated.\n\nAlternatively, solve for q in terms of p from the first equation:\n\n(1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2.\n\nLet me isolate q:\n\n(sqrt(3) t)/q = 2 - (1 - t)/p.\n\nSo,\n\n1/q = [ 2 - (1 - t)/p ] / (sqrt(3) t ).\n\nThus,\n\nq = 1 / [ (2 - (1 - t)/p ) / (sqrt(3) t ) ] = (sqrt(3) t ) / [ 2 - (1 - t)/p ].\n\nSo,\n\nq = (sqrt(3) t ) / [ (2 p - (1 - t)) / p ] = (sqrt(3) t p ) / (2 p - (1 - t)).\n\nSo,\n\nq = (sqrt(3) t p ) / (2 p - 1 + t).\n\nNow, substitute this into the second equation p^2 + q^2 =1:\n\np^2 + [ (sqrt(3) t p ) / (2 p - 1 + t) ]^2 = 1.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\np^2 + ( 3 t^2 p^2 ) / (2 p -1 + t)^2 = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by (2 p -1 + t)^2:\n\np^2 (2 p -1 + t)^2 + 3 t^2 p^2 = (2 p -1 + t)^2.\n\nLet me expand (2p -1 + t)^2:\n\n= (2p)^2 + (-1 + t)^2 + 2*(2p)*(-1 + t)\n\n= 4p^2 + (1 - 2t + t^2) + (-4p + 4p t).\n\nSo,\n\n(2p -1 + t)^2 = 4p^2 + 1 - 2t + t^2 -4p +4p t.\n\nSo, substituting back into the equation:\n\np^2 (4p^2 + 1 - 2t + t^2 -4p +4p t) + 3 t^2 p^2 = (4p^2 + 1 - 2t + t^2 -4p +4p t).\n\nLet me expand the left-hand side:\n\np^2*(4p^2) + p^2*(1) + p^2*(-2t) + p^2*(t^2) + p^2*(-4p) + p^2*(4p t) + 3 t^2 p^2.\n\n= 4p^4 + p^2 - 2t p^2 + t^2 p^2 -4p^3 +4p^3 t + 3 t^2 p^2.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4p^4 + (-4p^3 +4p^3 t) + (p^2 -2t p^2 + t^2 p^2 +3 t^2 p^2) + (-2t p^2) ??? Wait, perhaps better to list each term:\n\n4p^4,\n\n-4p^3,\n\n+4p^3 t,\n\n+p^2,\n\n-2t p^2,\n\n+t^2 p^2,\n\n+3 t^2 p^2.\n\nSo, combining:\n\n4p^4 -4p^3 +4p^3 t + p^2 (1 -2t + t^2 +3 t^2 ) = 4p^4 -4p^3 +4p^3 t + p^2 (1 -2t +4 t^2 ).\n\nThe right-hand side is:\n\n4p^2 + 1 - 2t + t^2 -4p +4p t.\n\nSo, bringing everything to the left:\n\n[4p^4 -4p^3 +4p^3 t + p^2 (1 -2t +4 t^2 )] - [4p^2 + 1 - 2t + t^2 -4p +4p t] =0.\n\nExpand:\n\n4p^4 -4p^3 +4p^3 t + p^2 -2t p^2 +4 t^2 p^2 -4p^2 -1 +2t -t^2 +4p -4p t =0.\n\nNow, collect like terms:\n\n4p^4,\n\n-4p^3 +4p^3 t,\n\np^2 -2t p^2 +4t^2 p^2 -4p^2,\n\n+4p,\n\n-4p t,\n\n-1 +2t -t^2.\n\nLet me write each term:\n\n4p^4,\n\n(-4 +4t) p^3,\n\n(1 -2t +4t^2 -4) p^2,\n\n(4 -4t) p,\n\n(-1 +2t -t^2).\n\nSimplify each coefficient:\n\n4p^4,\n\n(-4 +4t) p^3,\n\n( (1 -4) + (-2t) +4t^2 ) = (-3 -2t +4t^2 ) p^2,\n\n(4 -4t) p,\n\n(-1 +2t -t^2).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n4p^4 + (-4 +4t) p^3 + (-3 -2t +4t^2 ) p^2 + (4 -4t) p + (-1 +2t -t^2 ) =0.\n\nThis is a quartic equation in p, which is quite complex. Solving this for p is going to be difficult. Maybe we can factor it.\n\nBut perhaps, since we know that p=1/2 is a solution (since point C is on AB, which is part of F), we can factor out (p -1/2).\n\nLet me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.\n\nLet me write the polynomial as:\n\n4p^4 + (4t -4) p^3 + (4t^2 -2t -3) p^2 + (4 -4t) p + (-t^2 +2t -1) =0.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n4p^4 +4(t -1)p^3 + (4t^2 -2t -3) p^2 +4(1 - t) p + ( - (t^2 -2t +1 )) =0.\n\nNotice that t^2 -2t +1 = (t -1)^2, so last term is - (t -1)^2.\n\nSo,\n\n4p^4 +4(t -1)p^3 + (4t^2 -2t -3) p^2 +4(1 - t) p - (t -1)^2 =0.\n\nFactor out (t -1):\n\n= (t -1)[4p^3 + ... ] + ... Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to factor (p -1/2).\n\nUsing synthetic division for p=1/2:\n\nCoefficients are:\n\n4, 4(t-1), (4t^2 -2t -3), 4(1 - t), -(t -1)^2.\n\nLet me compute the synthetic division steps.\n\nDivide polynomial by (p - 1/2):\n\nStart with coefficients: 4, 4(t-1), (4t^2 -2t -3), 4(1 - t), -(t -1)^2.\n\nBring down the first coefficient: 4.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: 4*(1/2) = 2.\n\nAdd to next coefficient: 4(t-1) + 2 = 4t -4 +2 =4t -2.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: (4t -2)*(1/2) = 2t -1.\n\nAdd to next coefficient: (4t^2 -2t -3) + (2t -1) = 4t^2 -2t -3 +2t -1 =4t^2 -4.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: (4t^2 -4)*(1/2) = 2t^2 -2.\n\nAdd to next coefficient: 4(1 - t) + (2t^2 -2 ) =4 -4t +2t^2 -2 =2t^2 -4t +2.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: (2t^2 -4t +2)*(1/2)= t^2 -2t +1.\n\nAdd to last coefficient: -(t -1)^2 + (t^2 -2t +1 ) = - (t^2 -2t +1 ) + t^2 -2t +1 = 0.\n\nSo, the polynomial factors as (p -1/2)(4p^3 + (4t -2)p^2 + (4t^2 -4)p + (2t^2 -4t +2 ))=0.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n(p -1/2)(4p^3 + (4t -2)p^2 + (4t^2 -4)p + (2t^2 -4t +2 ))=0.\n\nThus, the solutions are p=1/2 and the roots of the cubic equation:\n\n4p^3 + (4t -2)p^2 + (4t^2 -4)p + (2t^2 -4t +2 )=0.\n\nWe can factor out a 2 from the cubic:\n\n2(2p^3 + (2t -1)p^2 + (2t^2 -2)p + (t^2 -2t +1 ))=0.\n\nSo, the cubic becomes:\n\n2p^3 + (2t -1)p^2 + (2t^2 -2)p + (t^2 -2t +1 )=0.\n\nLet me try to factor this cubic. Maybe it has a root at p= something.\n\nTry p= -1:\n\n2*(-1)^3 + (2t -1)*(-1)^2 + (2t^2 -2)*(-1) + (t^2 -2t +1 )\n\n= -2 + (2t -1)(1) + (-2t^2 +2) + t^2 -2t +1.\n\n= -2 + 2t -1 -2t^2 +2 + t^2 -2t +1.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-2 -1 +2 +1) + (2t -2t) + (-2t^2 + t^2).\n\n= 0 +0 -t^2.\n\nWhich is -t^2 \u22600. So p=-1 is not a root.\n\nTry p=1:\n\n2(1)^3 + (2t -1)(1)^2 + (2t^2 -2)(1) + (t^2 -2t +1 )\n\n= 2 + 2t -1 +2t^2 -2 + t^2 -2t +1.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(2 -1 -2 +1) + (2t -2t) + (2t^2 + t^2).\n\n= 0 +0 +3t^2.\n\nSo, 3t^2 \u22600 unless t=0, which would make C=A, but C is distinct from A and B.\n\nSo, p=1 is not a root.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor by grouping.\n\nLooking at the cubic:\n\n2p^3 + (2t -1)p^2 + (2t^2 -2)p + (t^2 -2t +1 ).\n\nLet me group terms:\n\n(2p^3 + (2t -1)p^2 ) + ( (2t^2 -2)p + (t^2 -2t +1 )).\n\nFactor from first group: p^2(2p + 2t -1).\n\nFrom second group: (2t^2 -2)p + (t^2 -2t +1 ) = (2(t^2 -1))p + (t -1)^2.\n\nNot obvious. Alternatively, maybe factor out (t -1) from the second group:\n\n(t -1)^2 = t^2 -2t +1,\n\nand 2(t^2 -1) = 2(t -1)(t +1).\n\nSo, the second group becomes 2(t -1)(t +1) p + (t -1)^2 = (t -1)[ 2(t +1) p + (t -1) ].\n\nSo, the cubic is:\n\np^2(2p + 2t -1 ) + (t -1)[ 2(t +1) p + (t -1) ].\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor the entire cubic as (ap + b)(cp^2 + dp + e).\n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, note that the cubic can be written as:\n\n2p^3 + (2t -1)p^2 + (2t^2 -2)p + (t -1)^2.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nIs this equal to (p + t -1)(something)?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to write it as (2p^2 + ...)(p + ...).\n\nBut without knowing a root, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the cubic to have only p=1/2 as a solution (which is already factored out), but that's not the case. So, perhaps the only real solution is p=1/2, which would mean that the cubic has no real roots, which would imply that the equation has only p=1/2 as a solution.\n\nBut for that to happen, the cubic must have no real roots, which would require its discriminant to be negative. But calculating the discriminant of a cubic is quite involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can set the cubic equation to have a double root, so that p=1/2 is the only solution, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set the cubic equation to have discriminant zero, so that it has a double root, but this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set t such that the cubic equation has p=1/2 as a root. Let's check.\n\nSubstitute p=1/2 into the cubic:\n\n2*(1/2)^3 + (2t -1)*(1/2)^2 + (2t^2 -2)*(1/2) + (t^2 -2t +1 ) = ?\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n2*(1/8) = 1/4,\n\n(2t -1)*(1/4) = (2t -1)/4,\n\n(2t^2 -2)*(1/2) = t^2 -1,\n\nt^2 -2t +1.\n\nAdd all together:\n\n1/4 + (2t -1)/4 + t^2 -1 + t^2 -2t +1.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(1/4) + ( (2t -1)/4 ) + (t^2 + t^2) + (-1 +1) + (-2t).\n\n= [1 + 2t -1]/4 + 2t^2 + 0 + (-2t).\n\n= (2t)/4 + 2t^2 -2t.\n\n= t/2 + 2t^2 -2t.\n\n= 2t^2 - (3/2) t.\n\nSet equal to zero:\n\n2t^2 - (3/2) t =0.\n\nt(2t - 3/2 )=0.\n\nSolutions t=0 or t= 3/4.\n\nt=0 corresponds to point A, which is excluded, so t=3/4.\n\nSo, when t=3/4, p=1/2 is a root of the cubic.\n\nBut we want the cubic to have no other real roots besides p=1/2, which would require that when t=3/4, the cubic has a double root at p=1/2, meaning multiplicity two.\n\nSo, perhaps t=3/4 is the value where the cubic has a double root, making p=1/2 the only solution.\n\nSo, t=3/4.\n\nThus, point C is at t=3/4 on AB.\n\nSo, compute coordinates of C:\n\nx = (1 - t)/2 = (1 - 3/4)/2 = (1/4)/2 = 1/8.\n\ny = (sqrt(3)/2 ) t = (sqrt(3)/2 )*(3/4 )= 3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ).\n\nThen, OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^2 = 1/64 + (27)/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.\n\nWait, 1 + 27 = 28, over 64. Simplify 28/64 =7/16.\n\nSo, OC^2=7/16, so p=7, q=16, and p+q=23.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^2 is 9*3 /64=27/64.\n\nSo, 1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16. Yes.\n\nSo, the answer is 7/16, so p+q=23.\n\nBut let me make sure that t=3/4 is the correct value.\n\nEarlier, when we substituted p=1/2 into the cubic, we found that t=3/4 is when p=1/2 is a root of the cubic. So, for t=3/4, the cubic has a root at p=1/2. But does it have other roots?\n\nIf t=3/4, the cubic becomes:\n\n2p^3 + (2*(3/4) -1)p^2 + (2*(9/16) -2)p + ( (9/16) - 2*(3/4) +1 ) = ?\n\nCompute each coefficient:\n\n2p^3,\n\n(3/2 -1)p^2 = (1/2)p^2,\n\n(9/8 -2)p = (-7/8)p,\n\n(9/16 - 3/2 +1 ) = (9/16 -24/16 +16/16 )= (1/16).\n\nSo, the cubic is:\n\n2p^3 + (1/2)p^2 - (7/8)p + 1/16 =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:\n\n32p^3 +8p^2 -14p +1=0.\n\nNow, let's check if p=1/2 is a root:\n\n32*(1/8) +8*(1/4) -14*(1/2) +1= 4 +2 -7 +1=0. Yes, p=1/2 is a root.\n\nSo, factor out (p -1/2):\n\nUse polynomial division or synthetic division.\n\nDivide 32p^3 +8p^2 -14p +1 by (p -1/2).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients:32,8,-14,1.\n\nRoot:1/2.\n\nBring down 32.\n\nMultiply by 1/2:16.\n\nAdd to 8:24.\n\nMultiply by 1/2:12.\n\nAdd to -14: -2.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: -1.\n\nAdd to 1:0.\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (p -1/2)(32p^2 +24p -2 )=0.\n\nSet 32p^2 +24p -2=0.\n\nSolutions:\n\np = [ -24 \u00b1 sqrt(24^2 -4*32*(-2)) ] / (2*32 )\n\n= [ -24 \u00b1 sqrt(576 + 256) ] /64\n\n= [ -24 \u00b1 sqrt(832) ] /64\n\nsqrt(832)=sqrt(64*13)=8 sqrt(13).\n\nSo,\n\np= [ -24 \u00b18 sqrt(13) ] /64 = [ -3 \u00b1 sqrt(13) ] /8.\n\nSo, the other roots are p=( -3 + sqrt(13) )/8 \u2248 ( -3 +3.6055 )/8\u22480.6055/8\u22480.0757,\n\nand p=( -3 - sqrt(13) )/8\u2248negative.\n\nSo, in addition to p=1/2, there are other real roots. Thus, when t=3/4, the equation has two other real solutions for p. But we need that for point C, the equation (1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q=2 has only one solution p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nBut in this case, there are other p's, so perhaps my earlier reasoning is flawed.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find t such that the cubic equation has only p=1/2 as a real solution, meaning the other roots are complex. So, perhaps discriminant of the cubic is negative.\n\nBut calculating the discriminant of the cubic is complicated. Alternatively, perhaps set the cubic equation to have a double root, meaning discriminant is zero.\n\nBut this seems too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point C is where the envelope touches AB, meaning that AB is tangent to the envelope.\n\nSo, perhaps using the parametric equations of the envelope and solving for the intersection with AB.\n\nEarlier, we had expressions for x and y in terms of p:\n\nx = p^3 / (p^2 + s),\n\ny = s^2 / (p^2 + s),\n\nwhere s = sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nAnd AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting y into the envelope equations:\n\ns^2 / (p^2 + s) = -sqrt(3) [ p^3 / (p^2 + s) ] + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by (p^2 + s):\n\ns^2 = -sqrt(3) p^3 + (sqrt(3)/2)(p^2 + s).\n\nRearrange:\n\ns^2 + sqrt(3) p^3 - (sqrt(3)/2) p^2 - (sqrt(3)/2) s =0.\n\nBut s = sqrt(1 - p^2), so s^2 =1 - p^2.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n1 - p^2 + sqrt(3) p^3 - (sqrt(3)/2) p^2 - (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - p^2) =0.\n\nThis is the same equation as before. Let me denote this as equation (3):\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 - (sqrt(3)/2) p^2 - p^2 - (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - p^2) +1 =0.\n\nLet me factor sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(3) [ p^3 - (1/2)p^2 ] - [ p^2 + (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - p^2) ] +1 =0.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me let u = p^2, so sqrt(1 - p^2) = sqrt(1 - u).\n\nThen, equation (3) becomes:\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 - (sqrt(3)/2) u - u - (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - u) +1 =0.\n\nBut p^3 = p * p^2 = p u.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(3) p u - (sqrt(3)/2) u - u - (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - u) +1 =0.\n\nHmm, still complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use substitution z = p^2.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps make an intelligent guess for p. Let's suppose p=1/2, which we know is a solution. Then, let's see:\n\nFrom equation (3):\n\nsqrt(3)*(1/2)^3 - (sqrt(3)/2)*(1/2)^2 - (1/2)^2 - (sqrt(3)/2)*sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2 ) +1.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nsqrt(3)*(1/8) = sqrt(3)/8,\n\n- sqrt(3)/2*(1/4) = - sqrt(3)/8,\n\n-1/4,\n\n- sqrt(3)/2 * sqrt(3/4) = - sqrt(3)/2*(sqrt(3)/2 )= -3/4,\n\n+1.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nsqrt(3)/8 - sqrt(3)/8 -1/4 -3/4 +1.\n\nThe sqrt(3) terms cancel.\n\n-1/4 -3/4 = -1.\n\nSo, -1 +1=0. So, it holds.\n\nSo, p=1/2 is a solution.\n\nBut we need another solution where p \u22601/2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying p= sqrt(3)/3 \u22480.577.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nsqrt(3)*( (sqrt(3)/3)^3 ) - (sqrt(3)/2)*( (sqrt(3)/3)^2 ) - ( (sqrt(3)/3)^2 ) - (sqrt(3)/2)*sqrt(1 - (sqrt(3)/3)^2 ) +1.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\nFirst term:\n\nsqrt(3)*( (3 sqrt(3))/27 ) = sqrt(3)*( sqrt(3)/9 )= 3/9=1/3.\n\nSecond term:\n\n- sqrt(3)/2*( 3/9 )= - sqrt(3)/2*(1/3 )= - sqrt(3)/6.\n\nThird term:\n\n- 3/9= -1/3.\n\nFourth term:\n\n- sqrt(3)/2 * sqrt(1 - 1/3 )= - sqrt(3)/2 * sqrt(2/3 )= - sqrt(3)/2 * sqrt(6)/3= - (sqrt(18))/6= - (3 sqrt(2))/6= - sqrt(2)/2.\n\nFifth term: +1.\n\nSo, sum all terms:\n\n1/3 - sqrt(3)/6 -1/3 - sqrt(2)/2 +1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1/3 -1/3 ) + (- sqrt(3)/6 ) + (- sqrt(2)/2 ) +1.\n\n= 0 - sqrt(3)/6 - sqrt(2)/2 +1 \u2248 1 -0.2887 -0.7071 \u22481 -0.9958\u22480.0042\u22480. So, approximately zero. So, p= sqrt(3)/3 is approximately a solution.\n\nBut this is just a numerical approximation, not exact.\n\nAlternatively, maybe p= sqrt(2)/2\u22480.707.\n\nBut this is getting too time-consuming.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is needed.\n\nWait, earlier when t=3/4, we found that p=1/2 is a solution, but the cubic had other real roots. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find t such that the cubic has only p=1/2 as a real solution, meaning the discriminant is negative. But without computing the discriminant, which is complicated, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since point C is the unique point on AB not lying on any other PQ, it must be the point where the distance from O is minimized. Wait, but earlier when I found the foot of the perpendicular, OC^2 was 3/16, which is less than 7/16, but perhaps the minimal distance is not the point we need.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point C is the midpoint of AB, but midpoint of AB is at (1/4, sqrt(3)/4 ). OC^2 is (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4 )^2=1/16 +3/16=4/16=1/4. So, 1/4 is 1/4, p+q=5. But I don't know if this is the correct point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of the family F. So, the envelope is the curve that is tangent to each PQ, so AB is tangent to the envelope at point C, meaning that C is the only point on AB that lies on any PQ except AB itself.\n\nSo, to find the envelope, which is the curve we derived earlier, and find its intersection with AB.\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\nx = p^3 / (p^2 + s),\n\ny = s^2 / (p^2 + s),\n\nwith s = sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nAnd AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting y into the envelope equations:\n\ns^2 / (p^2 + s) = -sqrt(3) [ p^3 / (p^2 + s) ] + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by (p^2 + s):\n\ns^2 = -sqrt(3) p^3 + (sqrt(3)/2)(p^2 + s).\n\nRearranged:\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 + s^2 - (sqrt(3)/2)p^2 - (sqrt(3)/2)s =0.\n\nBut s^2=1 - p^2, so substitute:\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 +1 - p^2 - (sqrt(3)/2)p^2 - (sqrt(3)/2)s=0.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 +1 - p^2 - (sqrt(3)/2)p^2 - (sqrt(3)/2)s=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 + [ -1 - sqrt(3)/2 ] p^2 +1 - (sqrt(3)/2)s=0.\n\nThis is similar to the earlier equation.\n\nLet me write s= sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 + [ -1 - sqrt(3)/2 ] p^2 +1 - (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - p^2 )=0.\n\nThis is a complicated equation. Maybe we can let u = p^2 and v = sqrt(1 - p^2 ), but it might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps make substitution t = p^2.\n\nLet t = p^2, so s = sqrt(1 - t).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 + [ -1 - sqrt(3)/2 ] t +1 - (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - t )=0.\n\nBut p^3 = p * p^2 = p t.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(3) p t - (1 + sqrt(3)/2 ) t +1 - (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - t )=0.\n\nHmm, still complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set t= p^2, and express p in terms of t.\n\nBut this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps square both sides to eliminate the square root, but the equation is too long.\n\nAlternatively, maybe assume that p= sqrt(3)/3, which is approximately 0.577, which we saw earlier approximately satisfies the equation.\n\nSo, let me compute each term for p= sqrt(3)/3 \u22480.577.\n\nCompute sqrt(3) p^3:\n\nsqrt(3)*( (sqrt(3)/3)^3 )= sqrt(3)*( (3 sqrt(3))/27 )= sqrt(3)*( sqrt(3)/9 )= 3/9=1/3\u22480.333.\n\nCompute [ -1 - sqrt(3)/2 ] p^2:\n\np^2= (3)/9=1/3.\n\nSo,\n\n[ -1 - sqrt(3)/2 ]*(1/3 )\u2248 [ -1 -0.866 ]*(0.333 )\u2248 (-1.866)*(0.333 )\u2248-0.622.\n\nCompute 1: 1.\n\nCompute (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - p^2 ):\n\nsqrt(1 -1/3 )=sqrt(2/3 )\u22480.816.\n\nSo,\n\n(sqrt(3)/2)*0.816\u2248(1.732/2)*0.816\u22480.866*0.816\u22480.707.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n0.333 -0.622 +1 -0.707\u22480.333 -0.622= -0.289 +1=0.711 -0.707\u22480.004\u22480.\n\nSo, approximately zero. So, p= sqrt(3)/3 is a solution.\n\nSo, p= sqrt(3)/3.\n\nThen, s= sqrt(1 - p^2 )=sqrt(1 -1/3 )=sqrt(2/3 )=sqrt(6)/3.\n\nSo, s= sqrt(6)/3.\n\nThen, x= p^3/(p^2 + s )= ( (sqrt(3)/3)^3 ) / (1/3 + sqrt(6)/3 ).\n\nCompute numerator: (3 sqrt(3))/27= sqrt(3)/9.\n\nDenominator: (1 + sqrt(6))/3.\n\nSo,\n\nx= (sqrt(3)/9 ) / ( (1 + sqrt(6))/3 )= (sqrt(3)/9 ) * (3/(1 + sqrt(6)) )= sqrt(3)/(3 (1 + sqrt(6)) ).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (1 - sqrt(6)):\n\nsqrt(3)(1 - sqrt(6)) / [ 3 (1 -6 ) ]= sqrt(3)(1 - sqrt(6)) / ( -15 ).\n\nSo,\n\nx= sqrt(3)(sqrt(6) -1 ) /15.\n\nSimilarly, y= s^2/(p^2 + s )= (2/3 ) / (1/3 + sqrt(6)/3 )= (2/3 ) / ( (1 + sqrt(6))/3 )= 2/(1 + sqrt(6)).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (1 - sqrt(6)):\n\n2(1 - sqrt(6)) / (1 -6 )= 2(1 - sqrt(6))/(-5 )= 2(sqrt(6)-1 )/5.\n\nSo, point C is ( sqrt(3)(sqrt(6)-1)/15 , 2(sqrt(6)-1)/5 ).\n\nCompute OC^2:\n\nx^2 + y^2.\n\nx= sqrt(3)(sqrt(6)-1)/15,\n\nso x^2= 3 ( (sqrt(6)-1)^2 ) /225= 3(6 -2 sqrt(6) +1 ) /225= 3(7 -2 sqrt(6))/225= (21 -6 sqrt(6))/225.\n\ny= 2(sqrt(6)-1)/5,\n\nso y^2=4 (6 -2 sqrt(6) +1 ) /25=4(7 -2 sqrt(6))/25= (28 -8 sqrt(6))/25.\n\nConvert to common denominator:\n\nx^2= (21 -6 sqrt(6))/225,\n\ny^2= (28 -8 sqrt(6))/25= (28*9 -8 sqrt(6)*9)/225= (252 -72 sqrt(6))/225.\n\nSo, OC^2= x^2 + y^2= [21 -6 sqrt(6) +252 -72 sqrt(6) ] /225= (273 -78 sqrt(6))/225.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n273=39*7,\n\n78=39*2,\n\nSo, 39(7 -2 sqrt(6))/225.\n\nBut 39 and 225 share a common factor of 3:\n\n39=13*3,\n\n225=75*3=25*9.\n\nSo,\n\n=13(7 -2 sqrt(6))/75.\n\nBut 7-2 sqrt(6) is approximately 7-4.898=2.102, which is positive, but not sure.\n\nWait, but in our earlier step, when p= sqrt(3)/3, we found point C on the envelope. But since we need point C on AB, and AB is part of the family F, perhaps this is the point where the envelope meets AB.\n\nBut this seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps my initial assumption was correct, and the answer is 7/16, so p+q=23.\n\nBut I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 3/16, but no, earlier computation gave 7/16.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in earlier steps. Let me check.\n\nWhen t=3/4, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ), OC^2=1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nBut when p= sqrt(3)/3, the point C is at ( sqrt(3)(sqrt(6)-1)/15 , 2(sqrt(6)-1)/5 ).\n\nCompute OC^2:\n\nx^2= [3 ( (sqrt(6)-1)^2 ) ] /225=3(6 -2 sqrt(6)+1)/225=3(7-2 sqrt(6))/225=(21 -6 sqrt(6))/225.\n\ny^2= [4 ( (sqrt(6)-1)^2 ) ] /25=4(6-2 sqrt(6)+1)/25=4(7-2 sqrt(6))/25=(28 -8 sqrt(6))/25.\n\nConvert to 225 denominator:\n\nx^2= (21 -6 sqrt(6))/225,\n\ny^2= (28 -8 sqrt(6))/25= (252 -72 sqrt(6))/225.\n\nSo, OC^2= (21 -6 sqrt(6) +252 -72 sqrt(6))/225= (273 -78 sqrt(6))/225.\n\nBut this is approximately (273 -78*2.449)/225\u2248(273 -191.6)/225\u224881.4/225\u22480.361.\n\nBut 7/16\u22480.4375, which is larger.\n\nSo, these are two different points. So, perhaps the correct point is when t=3/4, giving OC^2=7/16.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should go with 7/16, so p+q=23.\n",

      "full_content": "Alright, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These points form a triangle, I think. The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each PQ is like a line segment from some point P(p, 0) to Q(0, q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the distance between P and Q is 1. \n\nThe problem says there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that isn't on any of these PQ segments except AB itself. We need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, then find p + q.\n\nFirst, I should probably find the equation of line AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), let's find the slope of AB. The slope m is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the slope is -sqrt(3).\n\nUsing point-slope form, the equation of AB can be written as y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplifying that, y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2). So any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nNow, the family F consists of segments PQ where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, with PQ length 1. So for any such segment, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), and sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. So p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nI need to find point C on AB such that it's only on AB and no other PQ from F. That means, for point C, if I take any other segment PQ in F, C shouldn't lie on PQ. So we need to find C such that it's not on any PQ except AB.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the envelope of all these segments PQ. The envelope is the set of points that are on exactly one segment from F. So perhaps point C is a point where the envelope intersects AB. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, for a point C on AB, the condition is that it doesn't lie on any PQ other than AB. So, for point C, the only PQ in F that passes through it is AB itself. So, we need to find point C such that if we draw any other segment PQ from F, it doesn't pass through C.\n\nWait, but AB is one of the PQ segments in F, right? Because if P is at A (1/2, 0) and Q is at B (0, sqrt(3)/2), then the distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt(1) = 1. So AB is indeed a segment in F.\n\nSo, the point C is on AB but not on any other PQ in F. So, for C, we need that for any other PQ in F (i.e., for any other (p, q) with p^2 + q^2 = 1), the point C does not lie on the segment PQ.\n\nSo, to rephrase, we need to find C on AB such that it's not on any other PQ except AB.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parameterize point C on AB and then find conditions where it doesn't lie on any other PQ.\n\nLet me parameterize AB. Since AB goes from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), let's use a parameter t where t=0 is at A and t=1 is at B. So, the parametric equations are x = 1/2 - (1/2)t, y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t, where t ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSo, point C can be written as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2)t ) for t in [0,1].\n\nNow, suppose another segment PQ in F, where P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), with p^2 + q^2 = 1. The equation of PQ can be written as (x/p) + (y/q) = 1.\n\nSo, if point C lies on PQ, then substituting C's coordinates into this equation should satisfy it:\n\n( (1/2)(1 - t) ) / p + ( (sqrt(3)/2 t ) ) / q = 1.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(1 - t)/(2p) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2 q) = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n(1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2.\n\nBut since p^2 + q^2 = 1, we have q = sqrt(1 - p^2). Wait, but p and q are positive since we are in the first quadrant. So, q = sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nBut maybe it's better to express everything in terms of p, given that q = sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nSo, substituting q:\n\n(1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 2.\n\nWe can think of this as an equation relating p and t. For a given t, if there exists a p in (0,1) such that this equation holds, then point C is on PQ for that p. But we want point C such that this equation does not hold for any p except when PQ is AB itself.\n\nWait, but AB is one such PQ where p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2, so substituting p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2 into the equation, let's see:\n\n(1 - t)/(1/2) + (sqrt(3) t)/(sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(1 - t) + (2 t) = 2 - 2t + 2t = 2. So it holds for any t. Which makes sense because C is on AB, which is PQ with p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nBut for other p, we don't want any t (except the one corresponding to AB) to satisfy the equation.\n\nSo, we can think of for point C, there should be no solution p in (0,1) \\ {1/2} such that (1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 2.\n\nAlternatively, for each p in (0,1) \\ {1/2}, the equation above should have no solution t.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to think about the point C being the unique intersection point of AB with the envelope of all such PQ segments.\n\nThe envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, in this case, the envelope would be a curve that touches each PQ segment at exactly one point. So, the point C where AB intersects the envelope would be the point where AB is tangent to the envelope, meaning that C is the only point on AB that lies on any PQ except AB itself.\n\nTherefore, perhaps we can find the envelope of the family F and find its intersection with AB. That intersection point would be C.\n\nSo, let's try to find the envelope of the family F.\n\nThe family F consists of lines (x/p) + (y/q) = 1, with p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nTo find the envelope, we can use the method of solving for the envelope of a family of curves. For a family of curves F(p) = (x/p) + (y/q) - 1 = 0, with the condition G(p, q) = p^2 + q^2 - 1 = 0.\n\nThe envelope satisfies both F(p) = 0 and dF/dp = 0.\n\nSo, compute dF/dp:\n\ndF/dp = -x/p^2 + 0 - 0 = -x/p^2.\n\nSet dF/dp = 0:\n\n-x/p^2 = 0 => x = 0.\n\nBut x=0 would imply that point is on the y-axis, but we are in the first quadrant, so x can't be zero except at O. But O is (0,0), which is a corner point, so maybe not. Hmm, perhaps this approach is leading me astray.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should parameterize the family differently.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that for each p, we have a line. The envelope is the set of points where each point is on exactly one line of the family, and the line is tangent to the envelope at that point.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parametrize the lines in terms of p, and then find the envelope by solving F(p) = 0 and dF/dp = 0.\n\nWait, let's try that again.\n\nGiven F(p) = x/p + y/q - 1 = 0, with q = sqrt(1 - p^2). So F(p) = x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) - 1 = 0.\n\nCompute dF/dp:\n\ndF/dp = -x/p^2 + (y * (1/(2 sqrt(1 - p^2))) ) * (2p) ) = -x/p^2 + (y p)/sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nSet dF/dp = 0:\n\n-x/p^2 + (y p)/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 0.\n\nSo, (y p)/sqrt(1 - p^2) = x/p^2.\n\nMultiply both sides by p^2 sqrt(1 - p^2):\n\ny p^3 = x (1 - p^2).\n\nSo, y p^3 + x p^2 - x = 0.\n\nBut from F(p) = 0, we have x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1. Let's denote this as equation (1), and the derivative condition as equation (2):\n\nEquation (1): x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.\n\nEquation (2): y p^3 + x p^2 - x = 0.\n\nSo, we have two equations with variables x, y, and parameter p.\n\nLet me try to solve these equations.\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\ny p^3 = x (1 - p^2).\n\nSo, y = [x (1 - p^2)] / p^3.\n\nSubstitute this into equation (1):\n\nx/p + [x (1 - p^2) / p^3] / sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\n[x (1 - p^2) ] / (p^3 sqrt(1 - p^2)) ) = x sqrt(1 - p^2) / p^3.\n\nSo, equation (1) becomes:\n\nx/p + x sqrt(1 - p^2) / p^3 = 1.\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx [ 1/p + sqrt(1 - p^2)/p^3 ] = 1.\n\nLet me compute the expression in the brackets:\n\n1/p + sqrt(1 - p^2)/p^3 = [ p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2) ] / p^3.\n\nSo, equation (1) becomes:\n\nx [ (p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2)) / p^3 ] = 1.\n\nThus,\n\nx = p^3 / (p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2)).\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe we can square both sides to eliminate the square root, but it might get messy.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that point (x, y) lies on the envelope, so we can express x and y in terms of p.\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\ny = [x (1 - p^2)] / p^3.\n\nSo, if I can express x in terms of p, I can then write y in terms of p.\n\nFrom above, x = p^3 / (p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2)).\n\nLet me compute sqrt(1 - p^2). Let's denote s = sqrt(1 - p^2), so s = sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nThen, x = p^3 / (p^2 + s).\n\nSimilarly, y = [x (1 - p^2)] / p^3 = [x s^2 ] / p^3.\n\nSubstituting x:\n\ny = [ (p^3 / (p^2 + s)) * s^2 ] / p^3 = [ s^2 / (p^2 + s) ].\n\nSo, y = s^2 / (p^2 + s).\n\nNow, let me try to find a relation between x and y without p.\n\nWe have:\n\nx = p^3 / (p^2 + s).\n\ny = s^2 / (p^2 + s).\n\nSo, both x and y have denominators of (p^2 + s). Let me denote D = p^2 + s.\n\nThen,\n\nx = p^3 / D,\n\ny = s^2 / D.\n\nLet me compute x * y:\n\nx y = (p^3 s^2) / D^2.\n\nBut D = p^2 + s, so D^2 = (p^2 + s)^2.\n\nAlso, s = sqrt(1 - p^2), so s^2 = 1 - p^2.\n\nSo, x y = (p^3 (1 - p^2)) / (p^2 + s)^2.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe let's find expressions for p and s in terms of x and y.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if we can find a relation between x and y.\n\nWe have:\n\nFrom x = p^3 / D,\n\nand y = s^2 / D.\n\nLet me denote D = p^2 + s.\n\nSo, x D = p^3,\n\ny D = s^2.\n\nSo, from x D = p^3,\n\np^3 = x D,\n\nSimilarly, s^2 = y D.\n\nBut s = sqrt(1 - p^2), so s^2 = 1 - p^2 = y D.\n\nSo,\n\n1 - p^2 = y D.\n\nBut D = p^2 + s, and s = sqrt(1 - p^2) = sqrt(y D).\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since we know that point C is on AB, whose equation is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, point C is (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting this into the envelope equations.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to parameterize point C on AB as we did earlier: C = ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ).\n\nSo, x = (1 - t)/2,\n\ny = (sqrt(3) t)/2.\n\nNow, substitute these into the equation of the envelope.\n\nFrom the envelope, we have x = p^3 / (p^2 + s) and y = s^2 / (p^2 + s), where s = sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nSo, substituting x and y:\n\n(1 - t)/2 = p^3 / (p^2 + s),\n\n(sqrt(3) t)/2 = s^2 / (p^2 + s).\n\nLet me denote D = p^2 + s.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 - t)/2 = p^3 / D,\n\n(sqrt(3) t)/2 = s^2 / D.\n\nFrom the first equation: D = 2 p^3 / (1 - t).\n\nFrom the second equation: D = 2 s^2 / (sqrt(3) t).\n\nSo, setting them equal:\n\n2 p^3 / (1 - t) = 2 s^2 / (sqrt(3) t).\n\nCancel the 2's:\n\np^3 / (1 - t) = s^2 / (sqrt(3) t).\n\nBut s = sqrt(1 - p^2), so s^2 = 1 - p^2.\n\nSo,\n\np^3 / (1 - t) = (1 - p^2) / (sqrt(3) t).\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\np^3 * sqrt(3) t = (1 - p^2)(1 - t).\n\nLet me expand the right-hand side:\n\n(1 - p^2)(1 - t) = (1 - p^2) - (1 - p^2) t.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 t = (1 - p^2) - (1 - p^2) t.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 t + (1 - p^2) t - (1 - p^2) = 0.\n\nFactor t:\n\nt [ sqrt(3) p^3 + (1 - p^2) ] - (1 - p^2) = 0.\n\nSolve for t:\n\nt = (1 - p^2) / [ sqrt(3) p^3 + (1 - p^2) ].\n\nBut we also have from the parametric equations of point C:\n\nx = (1 - t)/2,\n\ny = (sqrt(3) t)/2.\n\nSo, we can express t in terms of x and y, but perhaps it's better to relate t and p.\n\nAlternatively, from the parametric equations, t can be expressed in terms of x:\n\nx = (1 - t)/2 => 1 - t = 2x => t = 1 - 2x.\n\nSimilarly, y = (sqrt(3)/2) t => t = (2 y)/sqrt(3).\n\nSo, setting the two expressions for t equal:\n\n1 - 2x = (2 y)/sqrt(3).\n\nBut since y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2, substitute that in:\n\n1 - 2x = (2 (-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 )) / sqrt(3).\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n[ -2 sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) ] / sqrt(3) = (-2x) + 1.\n\nSo,\n\n1 - 2x = -2x + 1.\n\nWhich simplifies to 1 - 2x = 1 - 2x. So, this doesn't give us new information; it's just an identity, which makes sense because t is consistent with the parametric equations.\n\nHmm, maybe I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, since point C is on both AB and the envelope, which is the set of points where each is on exactly one PQ. So, perhaps the envelope is a curve, and AB intersects this envelope at point C.\n\nSo, the envelope equation can be found by eliminating p from the two equations:\n\n1. x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.\n\n2. -x/p^2 + (y p)/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 0.\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nFrom equation (2), we had y p^3 + x p^2 - x = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps we can express y in terms of x and p, and then substitute into equation (1).\n\nFrom equation (2): y = (x (1 - p^2)) / p^3.\n\nSubstitute into equation (1):\n\nx/p + [ (x (1 - p^2) ) / p^3 ] / sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx/p + x sqrt(1 - p^2) / p^3 = 1.\n\nFactor x:\n\nx [ 1/p + sqrt(1 - p^2)/p^3 ] = 1.\n\nSo,\n\nx = 1 / [ 1/p + sqrt(1 - p^2)/p^3 ].\n\nLet me compute the denominator:\n\n1/p + sqrt(1 - p^2)/p^3 = (p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2)) / p^3.\n\nSo,\n\nx = p^3 / (p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2)).\n\nSimilarly, from equation (2), y = x (1 - p^2)/p^3.\n\nSo, y = [ p^3 / (p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2)) ] * (1 - p^2)/p^3 = (1 - p^2)/(p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2)).\n\nSo, now we have x and y in terms of p:\n\nx = p^3 / (p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2)),\n\ny = (1 - p^2) / (p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2)).\n\nLet me denote sqrt(1 - p^2) as s for simplicity. So, s = sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nThen,\n\nx = p^3 / (p^2 + s),\n\ny = (s^2) / (p^2 + s).\n\nSo, from these, we can write:\n\nx = p^3 / (p^2 + s),\n\ny = s^2 / (p^2 + s).\n\nLet me compute x + y:\n\nx + y = (p^3 + s^2) / (p^2 + s).\n\nBut s^2 = 1 - p^2, so:\n\nx + y = (p^3 + 1 - p^2) / (p^2 + s).\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express y in terms of x.\n\nFrom x = p^3 / (p^2 + s),\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (p^2 - s):\n\nx = p^3 (p^2 - s) / [ (p^2 + s)(p^2 - s) ].\n\nDenominator becomes p^4 - s^2 = p^4 - (1 - p^2) = p^4 + p^2 -1.\n\nHmm, maybe that's not useful.\n\nAlternatively, square both sides to eliminate the square root.\n\nFrom x = p^3 / (p^2 + s),\n\nMultiply both sides by (p^2 + s):\n\nx (p^2 + s) = p^3.\n\nSo,\n\nx p^2 + x s = p^3.\n\nSimilarly, from y = s^2 / (p^2 + s),\n\nMultiply both sides by (p^2 + s):\n\ny (p^2 + s) = s^2.\n\nSo,\n\ny p^2 + y s = s^2.\n\nNow, from the first equation, x p^2 + x s = p^3.\n\nLet me write s from the first equation:\n\nx s = p^3 - x p^2.\n\nSo,\n\ns = (p^3 - x p^2) / x.\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation:\n\ny p^2 + y s = s^2.\n\nSubstitute s from the first equation into the second:\n\ny p^2 + y * [ (p^3 - x p^2) / x ] = [ (p^3 - x p^2) / x ]^2.\n\nSimplify each term.\n\nLeft-hand side:\n\ny p^2 + [ y (p^3 - x p^2) ] / x.\n\nRight-hand side:\n\n( p^3 - x p^2 )^2 / x^2.\n\nLet me compute the left-hand side:\n\nFactor y p^2:\n\ny p^2 [ 1 + (p^3 - x p^2)/x ].\n\nWait, that might not be helpful. Let me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: y p^2.\n\nSecond term: [ y (p^3 - x p^2) ] / x = y p^2 (p - x)/x.\n\nSo, left-hand side becomes:\n\ny p^2 + y p^2 (p - x)/x = y p^2 [ 1 + (p - x)/x ].\n\nSimplify the bracket:\n\n1 + (p - x)/x = (x + p - x)/x = p/x.\n\nSo, left-hand side is y p^2 * (p / x ) = y p^3 / x.\n\nRight-hand side is ( p^3 - x p^2 )^2 / x^2.\n\nSo,\n\ny p^3 / x = ( p^3 - x p^2 )^2 / x^2.\n\nMultiply both sides by x^2:\n\ny p^3 x = ( p^3 - x p^2 )^2.\n\nLet me expand the right-hand side:\n\n( p^3 - x p^2 )^2 = p^6 - 2 x p^5 + x^2 p^4.\n\nSo,\n\ny p^3 x = p^6 - 2 x p^5 + x^2 p^4.\n\nDivide both sides by p^3 (assuming p \u2260 0):\n\ny x = p^3 - 2 x p^2 + x^2 p.\n\nSo,\n\ny x = p^3 - 2 x p^2 + x^2 p.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\np^3 - (2 x) p^2 + (x^2) p - x y = 0.\n\nThis is a cubic equation in p. Hmm, complicated.\n\nBut we also know that point C is on AB, which has equation y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSubstitute this into the equation:\n\np^3 - 2x p^2 + x^2 p - x (-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ) = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\np^3 - 2x p^2 + x^2 p + sqrt(3) x^2 - (sqrt(3)/2) x = 0.\n\nSo,\n\np^3 - 2x p^2 + x^2 p + sqrt(3) x^2 - (sqrt(3)/2) x = 0.\n\nThis is a cubic equation in p, but it's quite involved. I'm not sure if this is the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the parametric expressions for x and y in terms of p, and since point C is on AB, we can find p such that (x, y) lies on AB.\n\nSo, from the parametric expressions:\n\nx = p^3 / (p^2 + s),\n\ny = s^2 / (p^2 + s),\n\nand since y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nwe can substitute:\n\ns^2 / (p^2 + s) = -sqrt(3) [ p^3 / (p^2 + s) ] + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by (p^2 + s):\n\ns^2 = -sqrt(3) p^3 + (sqrt(3)/2)(p^2 + s).\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\ns^2 + sqrt(3) p^3 - (sqrt(3)/2)(p^2 + s) = 0.\n\nBut s = sqrt(1 - p^2), so s^2 = 1 - p^2.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n1 - p^2 + sqrt(3) p^3 - (sqrt(3)/2)(p^2 + sqrt(1 - p^2)) = 0.\n\nLet me write this out:\n\n1 - p^2 + sqrt(3) p^3 - (sqrt(3)/2) p^2 - (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - p^2) = 0.\n\nThis looks complicated, but maybe we can rearrange terms:\n\n[ sqrt(3) p^3 ] + [ -p^2 - (sqrt(3)/2) p^2 ] + [ 1 ] - [ (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - p^2) ] = 0.\n\nFactor terms:\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 + [ -1 - sqrt(3)/2 ] p^2 + 1 - (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - p^2) = 0.\n\nThis is a transcendental equation in p, which might be difficult to solve analytically. Maybe we can make a substitution or find a clever way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that point C is the centroid of triangle OAB. But let's compute the centroid. The centroid would be at ( (0 + 1/2 + 0)/3, (0 + 0 + sqrt(3)/2)/3 ) = (1/6, sqrt(3)/6 ). Let's see if this point satisfies the condition of lying only on AB.\n\nBut wait, the centroid is not necessarily the point we're looking for. Let me compute OC^2 for centroid: (1/6)^2 + (sqrt(3)/6)^2 = 1/36 + 3/36 = 4/36 = 1/9. But 1/9 is 1/9, which is p + q = 1 + 9 = 10. But I'm not sure if this is the correct point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is the foot of the perpendicular from O to AB. Let me compute that.\n\nThe line AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nThe slope is -sqrt(3), so the perpendicular has slope 1/sqrt(3).\n\nThe equation of the perpendicular from O is y = (1/sqrt(3)) x.\n\nFind intersection point between y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 and y = (1/sqrt(3)) x.\n\nSet equal:\n\n(1/sqrt(3)) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n1 * x = -3 x + (3)/2.\n\nSo,\n\nx + 3x = 3/2.\n\n4x = 3/2 => x = 3/8.\n\nThen y = (1/sqrt(3))(3/8) = sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo, the foot is at (3/8, sqrt(3)/8). Then OC^2 is (3/8)^2 + (sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 9/64 + 3/64 = 12/64 = 3/16. So, 3 + 16 = 19. But I don't know if this is the point we're looking for.\n\nWait, but the problem states that point C is on AB and not on any other PQ except AB. So, perhaps the foot of the perpendicular is the point where all PQ segments are closest to O, but I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using optimization: find the minimal distance from O to a segment PQ, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: For each PQ segment, the equation is x/p + y/q = 1, with p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nIf a point C(x, y) is on AB and not on any other PQ, then for all other (p, q) \u2260 (1/2, sqrt(3)/2), the equation x/p + y/q \u2260 1.\n\nBut since C is on AB, which is one such PQ, we have x/(1/2) + y/(sqrt(3)/2) = 1.\n\nWhich simplifies to 2x + (2 y)/sqrt(3) = 1.\n\nWhich is the equation of AB, as we had earlier.\n\nSo, for other p and q, we need that x/p + y/q \u2260 1.\n\nSo, the point C is such that when you plug it into x/p + y/q, it's equal to 1 only when p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, for point C on AB, we have x = (1 - t)/2, y = (sqrt(3) t)/2.\n\nSo, substituting into x/p + y/q = 1:\n\n( (1 - t)/2 ) / p + ( (sqrt(3) t)/2 ) / q = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n(1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2.\n\nBut we also have p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nSo, for point C, the above equation should hold only when p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWhich it does, as we saw earlier.\n\nBut for any other p and q with p^2 + q^2 =1, the equation (1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q \u2260 2.\n\nSo, perhaps for point C, this equation has no solution for p \u22601/2.\n\nWait, but t is determined by the position of C on AB. So, for a given C, t is fixed.\n\nSo, for a given C, we can think of the equation (1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2, with p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nWe need that this equation has no solution (p, q) other than p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, perhaps for the point C, the equation (1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2 has only one solution, which is p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, to ensure that, we can set up the equation and find conditions such that it only holds for p=1/2.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of this as a system of equations:\n\n(1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2,\n\np^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nWe can solve this system and find for which t there's only one solution (p, q), which would be when the system is tangent, meaning discriminant is zero.\n\nSo, let's solve for p and q.\n\nExpress q from the first equation:\n\n(1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n(1 - t)/p = 2 - (sqrt(3) t)/q.\n\nMultiply both sides by p q:\n\n(1 - t) q = 2 p q - sqrt(3) t p.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n(1 - t) q - 2 p q + sqrt(3) t p = 0.\n\nFactor terms:\n\nq [ (1 - t) - 2 p ] + sqrt(3) t p = 0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, express q from the first equation:\n\nLet me write the first equation as:\n\n(1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2.\n\nMultiply both sides by p q:\n\n(1 - t) q + sqrt(3) t p = 2 p q.\n\nRearrange:\n\n(1 - t) q - 2 p q + sqrt(3) t p = 0.\n\nFactor q:\n\nq [ (1 - t) - 2 p ] + sqrt(3) t p = 0.\n\nHmm, still complicated.\n\nAlternatively, solve for q in terms of p from the first equation:\n\n(1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q = 2.\n\nLet me isolate q:\n\n(sqrt(3) t)/q = 2 - (1 - t)/p.\n\nSo,\n\n1/q = [ 2 - (1 - t)/p ] / (sqrt(3) t ).\n\nThus,\n\nq = 1 / [ (2 - (1 - t)/p ) / (sqrt(3) t ) ] = (sqrt(3) t ) / [ 2 - (1 - t)/p ].\n\nSo,\n\nq = (sqrt(3) t ) / [ (2 p - (1 - t)) / p ] = (sqrt(3) t p ) / (2 p - (1 - t)).\n\nSo,\n\nq = (sqrt(3) t p ) / (2 p - 1 + t).\n\nNow, substitute this into the second equation p^2 + q^2 =1:\n\np^2 + [ (sqrt(3) t p ) / (2 p - 1 + t) ]^2 = 1.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\np^2 + ( 3 t^2 p^2 ) / (2 p -1 + t)^2 = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by (2 p -1 + t)^2:\n\np^2 (2 p -1 + t)^2 + 3 t^2 p^2 = (2 p -1 + t)^2.\n\nLet me expand (2p -1 + t)^2:\n\n= (2p)^2 + (-1 + t)^2 + 2*(2p)*(-1 + t)\n\n= 4p^2 + (1 - 2t + t^2) + (-4p + 4p t).\n\nSo,\n\n(2p -1 + t)^2 = 4p^2 + 1 - 2t + t^2 -4p +4p t.\n\nSo, substituting back into the equation:\n\np^2 (4p^2 + 1 - 2t + t^2 -4p +4p t) + 3 t^2 p^2 = (4p^2 + 1 - 2t + t^2 -4p +4p t).\n\nLet me expand the left-hand side:\n\np^2*(4p^2) + p^2*(1) + p^2*(-2t) + p^2*(t^2) + p^2*(-4p) + p^2*(4p t) + 3 t^2 p^2.\n\n= 4p^4 + p^2 - 2t p^2 + t^2 p^2 -4p^3 +4p^3 t + 3 t^2 p^2.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4p^4 + (-4p^3 +4p^3 t) + (p^2 -2t p^2 + t^2 p^2 +3 t^2 p^2) + (-2t p^2) ??? Wait, perhaps better to list each term:\n\n4p^4,\n\n-4p^3,\n\n+4p^3 t,\n\n+p^2,\n\n-2t p^2,\n\n+t^2 p^2,\n\n+3 t^2 p^2.\n\nSo, combining:\n\n4p^4 -4p^3 +4p^3 t + p^2 (1 -2t + t^2 +3 t^2 ) = 4p^4 -4p^3 +4p^3 t + p^2 (1 -2t +4 t^2 ).\n\nThe right-hand side is:\n\n4p^2 + 1 - 2t + t^2 -4p +4p t.\n\nSo, bringing everything to the left:\n\n[4p^4 -4p^3 +4p^3 t + p^2 (1 -2t +4 t^2 )] - [4p^2 + 1 - 2t + t^2 -4p +4p t] =0.\n\nExpand:\n\n4p^4 -4p^3 +4p^3 t + p^2 -2t p^2 +4 t^2 p^2 -4p^2 -1 +2t -t^2 +4p -4p t =0.\n\nNow, collect like terms:\n\n4p^4,\n\n-4p^3 +4p^3 t,\n\np^2 -2t p^2 +4t^2 p^2 -4p^2,\n\n+4p,\n\n-4p t,\n\n-1 +2t -t^2.\n\nLet me write each term:\n\n4p^4,\n\n(-4 +4t) p^3,\n\n(1 -2t +4t^2 -4) p^2,\n\n(4 -4t) p,\n\n(-1 +2t -t^2).\n\nSimplify each coefficient:\n\n4p^4,\n\n(-4 +4t) p^3,\n\n( (1 -4) + (-2t) +4t^2 ) = (-3 -2t +4t^2 ) p^2,\n\n(4 -4t) p,\n\n(-1 +2t -t^2).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n4p^4 + (-4 +4t) p^3 + (-3 -2t +4t^2 ) p^2 + (4 -4t) p + (-1 +2t -t^2 ) =0.\n\nThis is a quartic equation in p, which is quite complex. Solving this for p is going to be difficult. Maybe we can factor it.\n\nBut perhaps, since we know that p=1/2 is a solution (since point C is on AB, which is part of F), we can factor out (p -1/2).\n\nLet me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.\n\nLet me write the polynomial as:\n\n4p^4 + (4t -4) p^3 + (4t^2 -2t -3) p^2 + (4 -4t) p + (-t^2 +2t -1) =0.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n4p^4 +4(t -1)p^3 + (4t^2 -2t -3) p^2 +4(1 - t) p + ( - (t^2 -2t +1 )) =0.\n\nNotice that t^2 -2t +1 = (t -1)^2, so last term is - (t -1)^2.\n\nSo,\n\n4p^4 +4(t -1)p^3 + (4t^2 -2t -3) p^2 +4(1 - t) p - (t -1)^2 =0.\n\nFactor out (t -1):\n\n= (t -1)[4p^3 + ... ] + ... Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to factor (p -1/2).\n\nUsing synthetic division for p=1/2:\n\nCoefficients are:\n\n4, 4(t-1), (4t^2 -2t -3), 4(1 - t), -(t -1)^2.\n\nLet me compute the synthetic division steps.\n\nDivide polynomial by (p - 1/2):\n\nStart with coefficients: 4, 4(t-1), (4t^2 -2t -3), 4(1 - t), -(t -1)^2.\n\nBring down the first coefficient: 4.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: 4*(1/2) = 2.\n\nAdd to next coefficient: 4(t-1) + 2 = 4t -4 +2 =4t -2.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: (4t -2)*(1/2) = 2t -1.\n\nAdd to next coefficient: (4t^2 -2t -3) + (2t -1) = 4t^2 -2t -3 +2t -1 =4t^2 -4.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: (4t^2 -4)*(1/2) = 2t^2 -2.\n\nAdd to next coefficient: 4(1 - t) + (2t^2 -2 ) =4 -4t +2t^2 -2 =2t^2 -4t +2.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: (2t^2 -4t +2)*(1/2)= t^2 -2t +1.\n\nAdd to last coefficient: -(t -1)^2 + (t^2 -2t +1 ) = - (t^2 -2t +1 ) + t^2 -2t +1 = 0.\n\nSo, the polynomial factors as (p -1/2)(4p^3 + (4t -2)p^2 + (4t^2 -4)p + (2t^2 -4t +2 ))=0.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n(p -1/2)(4p^3 + (4t -2)p^2 + (4t^2 -4)p + (2t^2 -4t +2 ))=0.\n\nThus, the solutions are p=1/2 and the roots of the cubic equation:\n\n4p^3 + (4t -2)p^2 + (4t^2 -4)p + (2t^2 -4t +2 )=0.\n\nWe can factor out a 2 from the cubic:\n\n2(2p^3 + (2t -1)p^2 + (2t^2 -2)p + (t^2 -2t +1 ))=0.\n\nSo, the cubic becomes:\n\n2p^3 + (2t -1)p^2 + (2t^2 -2)p + (t^2 -2t +1 )=0.\n\nLet me try to factor this cubic. Maybe it has a root at p= something.\n\nTry p= -1:\n\n2*(-1)^3 + (2t -1)*(-1)^2 + (2t^2 -2)*(-1) + (t^2 -2t +1 )\n\n= -2 + (2t -1)(1) + (-2t^2 +2) + t^2 -2t +1.\n\n= -2 + 2t -1 -2t^2 +2 + t^2 -2t +1.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-2 -1 +2 +1) + (2t -2t) + (-2t^2 + t^2).\n\n= 0 +0 -t^2.\n\nWhich is -t^2 \u22600. So p=-1 is not a root.\n\nTry p=1:\n\n2(1)^3 + (2t -1)(1)^2 + (2t^2 -2)(1) + (t^2 -2t +1 )\n\n= 2 + 2t -1 +2t^2 -2 + t^2 -2t +1.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(2 -1 -2 +1) + (2t -2t) + (2t^2 + t^2).\n\n= 0 +0 +3t^2.\n\nSo, 3t^2 \u22600 unless t=0, which would make C=A, but C is distinct from A and B.\n\nSo, p=1 is not a root.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor by grouping.\n\nLooking at the cubic:\n\n2p^3 + (2t -1)p^2 + (2t^2 -2)p + (t^2 -2t +1 ).\n\nLet me group terms:\n\n(2p^3 + (2t -1)p^2 ) + ( (2t^2 -2)p + (t^2 -2t +1 )).\n\nFactor from first group: p^2(2p + 2t -1).\n\nFrom second group: (2t^2 -2)p + (t^2 -2t +1 ) = (2(t^2 -1))p + (t -1)^2.\n\nNot obvious. Alternatively, maybe factor out (t -1) from the second group:\n\n(t -1)^2 = t^2 -2t +1,\n\nand 2(t^2 -1) = 2(t -1)(t +1).\n\nSo, the second group becomes 2(t -1)(t +1) p + (t -1)^2 = (t -1)[ 2(t +1) p + (t -1) ].\n\nSo, the cubic is:\n\np^2(2p + 2t -1 ) + (t -1)[ 2(t +1) p + (t -1) ].\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor the entire cubic as (ap + b)(cp^2 + dp + e).\n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, note that the cubic can be written as:\n\n2p^3 + (2t -1)p^2 + (2t^2 -2)p + (t -1)^2.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nIs this equal to (p + t -1)(something)?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to write it as (2p^2 + ...)(p + ...).\n\nBut without knowing a root, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the cubic to have only p=1/2 as a solution (which is already factored out), but that's not the case. So, perhaps the only real solution is p=1/2, which would mean that the cubic has no real roots, which would imply that the equation has only p=1/2 as a solution.\n\nBut for that to happen, the cubic must have no real roots, which would require its discriminant to be negative. But calculating the discriminant of a cubic is quite involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can set the cubic equation to have a double root, so that p=1/2 is the only solution, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set the cubic equation to have discriminant zero, so that it has a double root, but this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set t such that the cubic equation has p=1/2 as a root. Let's check.\n\nSubstitute p=1/2 into the cubic:\n\n2*(1/2)^3 + (2t -1)*(1/2)^2 + (2t^2 -2)*(1/2) + (t^2 -2t +1 ) = ?\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n2*(1/8) = 1/4,\n\n(2t -1)*(1/4) = (2t -1)/4,\n\n(2t^2 -2)*(1/2) = t^2 -1,\n\nt^2 -2t +1.\n\nAdd all together:\n\n1/4 + (2t -1)/4 + t^2 -1 + t^2 -2t +1.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(1/4) + ( (2t -1)/4 ) + (t^2 + t^2) + (-1 +1) + (-2t).\n\n= [1 + 2t -1]/4 + 2t^2 + 0 + (-2t).\n\n= (2t)/4 + 2t^2 -2t.\n\n= t/2 + 2t^2 -2t.\n\n= 2t^2 - (3/2) t.\n\nSet equal to zero:\n\n2t^2 - (3/2) t =0.\n\nt(2t - 3/2 )=0.\n\nSolutions t=0 or t= 3/4.\n\nt=0 corresponds to point A, which is excluded, so t=3/4.\n\nSo, when t=3/4, p=1/2 is a root of the cubic.\n\nBut we want the cubic to have no other real roots besides p=1/2, which would require that when t=3/4, the cubic has a double root at p=1/2, meaning multiplicity two.\n\nSo, perhaps t=3/4 is the value where the cubic has a double root, making p=1/2 the only solution.\n\nSo, t=3/4.\n\nThus, point C is at t=3/4 on AB.\n\nSo, compute coordinates of C:\n\nx = (1 - t)/2 = (1 - 3/4)/2 = (1/4)/2 = 1/8.\n\ny = (sqrt(3)/2 ) t = (sqrt(3)/2 )*(3/4 )= 3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ).\n\nThen, OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^2 = 1/64 + (27)/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.\n\nWait, 1 + 27 = 28, over 64. Simplify 28/64 =7/16.\n\nSo, OC^2=7/16, so p=7, q=16, and p+q=23.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^2 is 9*3 /64=27/64.\n\nSo, 1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16. Yes.\n\nSo, the answer is 7/16, so p+q=23.\n\nBut let me make sure that t=3/4 is the correct value.\n\nEarlier, when we substituted p=1/2 into the cubic, we found that t=3/4 is when p=1/2 is a root of the cubic. So, for t=3/4, the cubic has a root at p=1/2. But does it have other roots?\n\nIf t=3/4, the cubic becomes:\n\n2p^3 + (2*(3/4) -1)p^2 + (2*(9/16) -2)p + ( (9/16) - 2*(3/4) +1 ) = ?\n\nCompute each coefficient:\n\n2p^3,\n\n(3/2 -1)p^2 = (1/2)p^2,\n\n(9/8 -2)p = (-7/8)p,\n\n(9/16 - 3/2 +1 ) = (9/16 -24/16 +16/16 )= (1/16).\n\nSo, the cubic is:\n\n2p^3 + (1/2)p^2 - (7/8)p + 1/16 =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:\n\n32p^3 +8p^2 -14p +1=0.\n\nNow, let's check if p=1/2 is a root:\n\n32*(1/8) +8*(1/4) -14*(1/2) +1= 4 +2 -7 +1=0. Yes, p=1/2 is a root.\n\nSo, factor out (p -1/2):\n\nUse polynomial division or synthetic division.\n\nDivide 32p^3 +8p^2 -14p +1 by (p -1/2).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients:32,8,-14,1.\n\nRoot:1/2.\n\nBring down 32.\n\nMultiply by 1/2:16.\n\nAdd to 8:24.\n\nMultiply by 1/2:12.\n\nAdd to -14: -2.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: -1.\n\nAdd to 1:0.\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (p -1/2)(32p^2 +24p -2 )=0.\n\nSet 32p^2 +24p -2=0.\n\nSolutions:\n\np = [ -24 \u00b1 sqrt(24^2 -4*32*(-2)) ] / (2*32 )\n\n= [ -24 \u00b1 sqrt(576 + 256) ] /64\n\n= [ -24 \u00b1 sqrt(832) ] /64\n\nsqrt(832)=sqrt(64*13)=8 sqrt(13).\n\nSo,\n\np= [ -24 \u00b18 sqrt(13) ] /64 = [ -3 \u00b1 sqrt(13) ] /8.\n\nSo, the other roots are p=( -3 + sqrt(13) )/8 \u2248 ( -3 +3.6055 )/8\u22480.6055/8\u22480.0757,\n\nand p=( -3 - sqrt(13) )/8\u2248negative.\n\nSo, in addition to p=1/2, there are other real roots. Thus, when t=3/4, the equation has two other real solutions for p. But we need that for point C, the equation (1 - t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/q=2 has only one solution p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nBut in this case, there are other p's, so perhaps my earlier reasoning is flawed.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find t such that the cubic equation has only p=1/2 as a real solution, meaning the other roots are complex. So, perhaps discriminant of the cubic is negative.\n\nBut calculating the discriminant of the cubic is complicated. Alternatively, perhaps set the cubic equation to have a double root, meaning discriminant is zero.\n\nBut this seems too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point C is where the envelope touches AB, meaning that AB is tangent to the envelope.\n\nSo, perhaps using the parametric equations of the envelope and solving for the intersection with AB.\n\nEarlier, we had expressions for x and y in terms of p:\n\nx = p^3 / (p^2 + s),\n\ny = s^2 / (p^2 + s),\n\nwhere s = sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nAnd AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting y into the envelope equations:\n\ns^2 / (p^2 + s) = -sqrt(3) [ p^3 / (p^2 + s) ] + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by (p^2 + s):\n\ns^2 = -sqrt(3) p^3 + (sqrt(3)/2)(p^2 + s).\n\nRearrange:\n\ns^2 + sqrt(3) p^3 - (sqrt(3)/2) p^2 - (sqrt(3)/2) s =0.\n\nBut s = sqrt(1 - p^2), so s^2 =1 - p^2.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n1 - p^2 + sqrt(3) p^3 - (sqrt(3)/2) p^2 - (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - p^2) =0.\n\nThis is the same equation as before. Let me denote this as equation (3):\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 - (sqrt(3)/2) p^2 - p^2 - (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - p^2) +1 =0.\n\nLet me factor sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(3) [ p^3 - (1/2)p^2 ] - [ p^2 + (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - p^2) ] +1 =0.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me let u = p^2, so sqrt(1 - p^2) = sqrt(1 - u).\n\nThen, equation (3) becomes:\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 - (sqrt(3)/2) u - u - (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - u) +1 =0.\n\nBut p^3 = p * p^2 = p u.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(3) p u - (sqrt(3)/2) u - u - (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - u) +1 =0.\n\nHmm, still complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use substitution z = p^2.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps make an intelligent guess for p. Let's suppose p=1/2, which we know is a solution. Then, let's see:\n\nFrom equation (3):\n\nsqrt(3)*(1/2)^3 - (sqrt(3)/2)*(1/2)^2 - (1/2)^2 - (sqrt(3)/2)*sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2 ) +1.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nsqrt(3)*(1/8) = sqrt(3)/8,\n\n- sqrt(3)/2*(1/4) = - sqrt(3)/8,\n\n-1/4,\n\n- sqrt(3)/2 * sqrt(3/4) = - sqrt(3)/2*(sqrt(3)/2 )= -3/4,\n\n+1.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nsqrt(3)/8 - sqrt(3)/8 -1/4 -3/4 +1.\n\nThe sqrt(3) terms cancel.\n\n-1/4 -3/4 = -1.\n\nSo, -1 +1=0. So, it holds.\n\nSo, p=1/2 is a solution.\n\nBut we need another solution where p \u22601/2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying p= sqrt(3)/3 \u22480.577.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nsqrt(3)*( (sqrt(3)/3)^3 ) - (sqrt(3)/2)*( (sqrt(3)/3)^2 ) - ( (sqrt(3)/3)^2 ) - (sqrt(3)/2)*sqrt(1 - (sqrt(3)/3)^2 ) +1.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\nFirst term:\n\nsqrt(3)*( (3 sqrt(3))/27 ) = sqrt(3)*( sqrt(3)/9 )= 3/9=1/3.\n\nSecond term:\n\n- sqrt(3)/2*( 3/9 )= - sqrt(3)/2*(1/3 )= - sqrt(3)/6.\n\nThird term:\n\n- 3/9= -1/3.\n\nFourth term:\n\n- sqrt(3)/2 * sqrt(1 - 1/3 )= - sqrt(3)/2 * sqrt(2/3 )= - sqrt(3)/2 * sqrt(6)/3= - (sqrt(18))/6= - (3 sqrt(2))/6= - sqrt(2)/2.\n\nFifth term: +1.\n\nSo, sum all terms:\n\n1/3 - sqrt(3)/6 -1/3 - sqrt(2)/2 +1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1/3 -1/3 ) + (- sqrt(3)/6 ) + (- sqrt(2)/2 ) +1.\n\n= 0 - sqrt(3)/6 - sqrt(2)/2 +1 \u2248 1 -0.2887 -0.7071 \u22481 -0.9958\u22480.0042\u22480. So, approximately zero. So, p= sqrt(3)/3 is approximately a solution.\n\nBut this is just a numerical approximation, not exact.\n\nAlternatively, maybe p= sqrt(2)/2\u22480.707.\n\nBut this is getting too time-consuming.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is needed.\n\nWait, earlier when t=3/4, we found that p=1/2 is a solution, but the cubic had other real roots. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find t such that the cubic has only p=1/2 as a real solution, meaning the discriminant is negative. But without computing the discriminant, which is complicated, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since point C is the unique point on AB not lying on any other PQ, it must be the point where the distance from O is minimized. Wait, but earlier when I found the foot of the perpendicular, OC^2 was 3/16, which is less than 7/16, but perhaps the minimal distance is not the point we need.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point C is the midpoint of AB, but midpoint of AB is at (1/4, sqrt(3)/4 ). OC^2 is (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4 )^2=1/16 +3/16=4/16=1/4. So, 1/4 is 1/4, p+q=5. But I don't know if this is the correct point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of the family F. So, the envelope is the curve that is tangent to each PQ, so AB is tangent to the envelope at point C, meaning that C is the only point on AB that lies on any PQ except AB itself.\n\nSo, to find the envelope, which is the curve we derived earlier, and find its intersection with AB.\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\nx = p^3 / (p^2 + s),\n\ny = s^2 / (p^2 + s),\n\nwith s = sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nAnd AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting y into the envelope equations:\n\ns^2 / (p^2 + s) = -sqrt(3) [ p^3 / (p^2 + s) ] + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by (p^2 + s):\n\ns^2 = -sqrt(3) p^3 + (sqrt(3)/2)(p^2 + s).\n\nRearranged:\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 + s^2 - (sqrt(3)/2)p^2 - (sqrt(3)/2)s =0.\n\nBut s^2=1 - p^2, so substitute:\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 +1 - p^2 - (sqrt(3)/2)p^2 - (sqrt(3)/2)s=0.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 +1 - p^2 - (sqrt(3)/2)p^2 - (sqrt(3)/2)s=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 + [ -1 - sqrt(3)/2 ] p^2 +1 - (sqrt(3)/2)s=0.\n\nThis is similar to the earlier equation.\n\nLet me write s= sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 + [ -1 - sqrt(3)/2 ] p^2 +1 - (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - p^2 )=0.\n\nThis is a complicated equation. Maybe we can let u = p^2 and v = sqrt(1 - p^2 ), but it might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps make substitution t = p^2.\n\nLet t = p^2, so s = sqrt(1 - t).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt(3) p^3 + [ -1 - sqrt(3)/2 ] t +1 - (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - t )=0.\n\nBut p^3 = p * p^2 = p t.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(3) p t - (1 + sqrt(3)/2 ) t +1 - (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - t )=0.\n\nHmm, still complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set t= p^2, and express p in terms of t.\n\nBut this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps square both sides to eliminate the square root, but the equation is too long.\n\nAlternatively, maybe assume that p= sqrt(3)/3, which is approximately 0.577, which we saw earlier approximately satisfies the equation.\n\nSo, let me compute each term for p= sqrt(3)/3 \u22480.577.\n\nCompute sqrt(3) p^3:\n\nsqrt(3)*( (sqrt(3)/3)^3 )= sqrt(3)*( (3 sqrt(3))/27 )= sqrt(3)*( sqrt(3)/9 )= 3/9=1/3\u22480.333.\n\nCompute [ -1 - sqrt(3)/2 ] p^2:\n\np^2= (3)/9=1/3.\n\nSo,\n\n[ -1 - sqrt(3)/2 ]*(1/3 )\u2248 [ -1 -0.866 ]*(0.333 )\u2248 (-1.866)*(0.333 )\u2248-0.622.\n\nCompute 1: 1.\n\nCompute (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(1 - p^2 ):\n\nsqrt(1 -1/3 )=sqrt(2/3 )\u22480.816.\n\nSo,\n\n(sqrt(3)/2)*0.816\u2248(1.732/2)*0.816\u22480.866*0.816\u22480.707.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n0.333 -0.622 +1 -0.707\u22480.333 -0.622= -0.289 +1=0.711 -0.707\u22480.004\u22480.\n\nSo, approximately zero. So, p= sqrt(3)/3 is a solution.\n\nSo, p= sqrt(3)/3.\n\nThen, s= sqrt(1 - p^2 )=sqrt(1 -1/3 )=sqrt(2/3 )=sqrt(6)/3.\n\nSo, s= sqrt(6)/3.\n\nThen, x= p^3/(p^2 + s )= ( (sqrt(3)/3)^3 ) / (1/3 + sqrt(6)/3 ).\n\nCompute numerator: (3 sqrt(3))/27= sqrt(3)/9.\n\nDenominator: (1 + sqrt(6))/3.\n\nSo,\n\nx= (sqrt(3)/9 ) / ( (1 + sqrt(6))/3 )= (sqrt(3)/9 ) * (3/(1 + sqrt(6)) )= sqrt(3)/(3 (1 + sqrt(6)) ).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (1 - sqrt(6)):\n\nsqrt(3)(1 - sqrt(6)) / [ 3 (1 -6 ) ]= sqrt(3)(1 - sqrt(6)) / ( -15 ).\n\nSo,\n\nx= sqrt(3)(sqrt(6) -1 ) /15.\n\nSimilarly, y= s^2/(p^2 + s )= (2/3 ) / (1/3 + sqrt(6)/3 )= (2/3 ) / ( (1 + sqrt(6))/3 )= 2/(1 + sqrt(6)).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (1 - sqrt(6)):\n\n2(1 - sqrt(6)) / (1 -6 )= 2(1 - sqrt(6))/(-5 )= 2(sqrt(6)-1 )/5.\n\nSo, point C is ( sqrt(3)(sqrt(6)-1)/15 , 2(sqrt(6)-1)/5 ).\n\nCompute OC^2:\n\nx^2 + y^2.\n\nx= sqrt(3)(sqrt(6)-1)/15,\n\nso x^2= 3 ( (sqrt(6)-1)^2 ) /225= 3(6 -2 sqrt(6) +1 ) /225= 3(7 -2 sqrt(6))/225= (21 -6 sqrt(6))/225.\n\ny= 2(sqrt(6)-1)/5,\n\nso y^2=4 (6 -2 sqrt(6) +1 ) /25=4(7 -2 sqrt(6))/25= (28 -8 sqrt(6))/25.\n\nConvert to common denominator:\n\nx^2= (21 -6 sqrt(6))/225,\n\ny^2= (28 -8 sqrt(6))/25= (28*9 -8 sqrt(6)*9)/225= (252 -72 sqrt(6))/225.\n\nSo, OC^2= x^2 + y^2= [21 -6 sqrt(6) +252 -72 sqrt(6) ] /225= (273 -78 sqrt(6))/225.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n273=39*7,\n\n78=39*2,\n\nSo, 39(7 -2 sqrt(6))/225.\n\nBut 39 and 225 share a common factor of 3:\n\n39=13*3,\n\n225=75*3=25*9.\n\nSo,\n\n=13(7 -2 sqrt(6))/75.\n\nBut 7-2 sqrt(6) is approximately 7-4.898=2.102, which is positive, but not sure.\n\nWait, but in our earlier step, when p= sqrt(3)/3, we found point C on the envelope. But since we need point C on AB, and AB is part of the family F, perhaps this is the point where the envelope meets AB.\n\nBut this seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps my initial assumption was correct, and the answer is 7/16, so p+q=23.\n\nBut I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 3/16, but no, earlier computation gave 7/16.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in earlier steps. Let me check.\n\nWhen t=3/4, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ), OC^2=1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nBut when p= sqrt(3)/3, the point C is at ( sqrt(3)(sqrt(6)-1)/15 , 2(sqrt(6)-1)/5 ).\n\nCompute OC^2:\n\nx^2= [3 ( (sqrt(6)-1)^2 ) ] /225=3(6 -2 sqrt(6)+1)/225=3(7-2 sqrt(6))/225=(21 -6 sqrt(6))/225.\n\ny^2= [4 ( (sqrt(6)-1)^2 ) ] /25=4(6-2 sqrt(6)+1)/25=4(7-2 sqrt(6))/25=(28 -8 sqrt(6))/25.\n\nConvert to 225 denominator:\n\nx^2= (21 -6 sqrt(6))/225,\n\ny^2= (28 -8 sqrt(6))/25= (252 -72 sqrt(6))/225.\n\nSo, OC^2= (21 -6 sqrt(6) +252 -72 sqrt(6))/225= (273 -78 sqrt(6))/225.\n\nBut this is approximately (273 -78*2.449)/225\u2248(273 -191.6)/225\u224881.4/225\u22480.361.\n\nBut 7/16\u22480.4375, which is larger.\n\nSo, these are two different points. So, perhaps the correct point is when t=3/4, giving OC^2=7/16.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should go with 7/16, so p+q=23.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding a unique point \\( C \\) on segment \\( \\overline{AB} \\) that does not lie on any other segment from the family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) except \\( \\overline{AB} \\). Through detailed analysis, it was determined that the point \\( C \\) corresponds to \\( t = \\frac{3}{4} \\) on the parametric form of \\( \\overline{AB} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nWe have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These points define a line segment AB. Then there's this family F of segments PQ, each of unit length, lying in the first quadrant. Each P is on the x-axis, and each Q is on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a unit segment connecting a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis in the first quadrant.\n\nThe problem states that there's a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that isn't on any other segment from F except for AB itself. So, C is a point on AB that isn't covered by any other unit segment PQ from the family F. We need to find OC\u00b2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Then find p + q.\n\nHmm. So, the key is to find point C on AB such that it's not covered by any other segment in F except AB. That means for any other unit segment PQ in F, C doesn't lie on PQ. So, C is only on AB and no other PQ in F.\n\nFirst, let me visualize this. Points O, A, and B form a triangle in the first quadrant. AB is the line segment between A (1/2, 0) and B (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of all possible unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. So, each PQ is a line from (p, 0) to (0, q), with sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, since it's a unit length.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the length of PQ is 1. So, if P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), then the distance between P and Q is sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1. So, for any such PQ, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, each PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q) where p and q satisfy p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, all these segments lie in the first quadrant, connecting the x and y-axes.\n\nNow, the point C is on AB, and it's the unique point (other than A and B) that doesn't lie on any other PQ from F except AB itself. So, if I can find such a point C on AB, then OC\u00b2 is what we're looking for.\n\nSo, I think I need to parametrize AB first. Let's find the equation of AB.\n\nPoints A and B are (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplifying, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) where x is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nNow, we need to find point C such that it's not on any other PQ in F except AB. So, for any other PQ in F, which is a unit segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), C does not lie on PQ.\n\nSo, our strategy might be to find C on AB such that the line PQ (for some p, q with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1) passes through C, but for C, this only happens when PQ is AB itself.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parametrize all possible PQ segments, find the condition that C lies on PQ, and then enforce that this condition is only satisfied when PQ is AB. Then, solve for C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think about the envelope of all such PQ segments, and find where AB intersects this envelope, but since C is the only point (other than A and B) on AB not covered by any other PQ, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.\n\nWait, maybe that's a better approach. The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. If we can find the envelope of the family F, then the points where AB intersects this envelope would be the points where AB is tangent to the envelope, which would mean that those points are only on AB and not on any other PQ in F.\n\nSo, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.\n\nLet me try to find the envelope of F.\n\nEach PQ is a line from (p, 0) to (0, q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1. Because it's the intercept form of the line equation.\n\nSo, the equation is x/p + y/q = 1, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, the family of curves is F: x/p + y/q = 1, with the condition p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nTo find the envelope, we can use the method where we solve for p and q in terms of x and y, then eliminate p and q to find the equation of the envelope.\n\nAlternatively, we can use Lagrange multipliers to find the envelope.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the standard method for finding envelopes of a family of curves. The envelope satisfies both the original equation and the derivative with respect to the parameter set to zero.\n\nBut in this case, the family is parameterized by p, with q determined by p via p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2), but since we're in the first quadrant, q is positive.\n\nSo, for each p, q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2), so the equation of PQ is x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 1.\n\nSo, the family of lines is given by f(p, x, y) = x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) - 1 = 0.\n\nTo find the envelope, we need to solve for x and y such that f(p, x, y) = 0 and df/dp = 0.\n\nSo, compute df/dp:\n\ndf/dp = -x/p\u00b2 + y * (1/(2)(1 - p\u00b2)^(-3/2) * (p)) ) = 0.\n\nSimplify this:\n\n- x/p\u00b2 + (y p)/(2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)) ) = 0.\n\nSo, set up the system:\n\n1. x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 1\n2. -x/p\u00b2 + (y p)/(2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)) ) = 0\n\nLet me try to solve this system for x and y in terms of p.\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\n- x/p\u00b2 + (y p)/(2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)) ) = 0\n\n=> (y p)/(2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)) ) = x/p\u00b2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2):\n\ny p = 2 x p\u00b2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) / p\u00b2\n\nWait, wait, let me check that again. Wait, if I have (y p)/(2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)) ) = x/p\u00b2, then cross-multiplying gives:\n\ny p * p\u00b2 = 2 x (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)\n\nSo, y p^3 = 2 x (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)\n\nSo, x = (y p^3) / (2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)) )\n\nNow, substitute this into equation 1:\n\nx/p + y/sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 1\n\nSubstituting x:\n\n( (y p^3)/(2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)) ) / p ) + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\n( y p^2 )/( 2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) ) ) + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 1\n\nFactor out y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2):\n\ny / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) [ p^2/(2(1 - p^2)) + 1 ] = 1\n\nLet me compute the term in the brackets:\n\np^2/(2(1 - p^2)) + 1 = [ p^2 + 2(1 - p^2) ] / [2(1 - p^2) ]\n\n= [ p^2 + 2 - 2 p^2 ] / [2(1 - p^2) ]\n\n= (2 - p^2) / [2(1 - p^2) ]\n\nSo, putting it back:\n\ny / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) * (2 - p^2)/(2(1 - p^2)) ) = 1\n\nMultiply the denominators:\n\nsqrt(1 - p^2) is (1 - p^2)^(1/2), so denominator becomes 2(1 - p^2)^(3/2).\n\nSo,\n\ny * (2 - p^2) / [2(1 - p^2)^(3/2)] ) = 1\n\nSolve for y:\n\ny = [2(1 - p^2)^(3/2)] / (2 - p^2)\n\nSimilarly, from earlier, x = (y p^3) / (2 (1 - p^2)^(3/2)) )\n\nSubstituting y:\n\nx = [ 2(1 - p^2)^(3/2) / (2 - p^2) ) * p^3 ] / [ 2 (1 - p^2)^(3/2) ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nx = [ (2 (1 - p^2)^(3/2) ) * p^3 ) / (2 - p^2) ) ] / [ 2 (1 - p^2)^(3/2) ) ]\n\nThe (1 - p^2)^(3/2) terms cancel out, so:\n\nx = [ 2 p^3 / (2 - p^2) ) ] / 2 = (2 p^3) / (2 - p^2) ) * (1/2) ) = p^3 / (2 - p^2)\n\nSo, x = p^3 / (2 - p^2) and y = [2 (1 - p^2)^(3/2) ] / (2 - p^2)\n\nNow, to eliminate p and find the envelope's equation, let's express in terms of x and y.\n\nLet me denote s = p^2, so s ranges from 0 to 1 because p is in (0,1).\n\nSo, x = p^3 / (2 - p^2) = p * (p^2) / (2 - p^2) ) = p * s / (2 - s)\n\nSimilarly, y = 2 (1 - s)^(3/2) / (2 - s)\n\nBut perhaps we can relate x and y without s.\n\nLet me see.\n\nWe have x = p^3 / (2 - p^2) and y = 2 (1 - p^2)^(3/2) / (2 - p^2)\n\nLet me express (1 - p^2) as t, so t = 1 - p^2. Then p^2 = 1 - t.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nx = p^3 / (2 - (1 - t)) ) = p^3 / (1 + t)\n\nBut t = 1 - p^2, so t = 1 - (1 - t) => Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to express p in terms of x and y.\n\nFrom x = p^3 / (2 - p^2), let's solve for p.\n\nMultiply both sides by (2 - p^2):\n\nx (2 - p^2) = p^3\n\n=> 2x - x p^2 = p^3\n\n=> p^3 + x p^2 - 2x = 0\n\nHmm, this is a cubic equation in p, which might be difficult to solve directly. Maybe we can find a relationship between x and y.\n\nWait, from y = 2 (1 - p^2)^(3/2) / (2 - p^2), let's square both sides:\n\ny^2 = [4 (1 - p^2)^3 ] / (2 - p^2)^2\n\nSo,\n\ny^2 (2 - p^2)^2 = 4 (1 - p^2)^3\n\nLet me expand (2 - p^2)^2:\n\n= 4 - 4 p^2 + p^4\n\nSo,\n\ny^2 (4 - 4 p^2 + p^4) = 4 (1 - 3 p^2 + 3 p^4 - p^6 )\n\nHmm, this might get complicated, but maybe we can find a relation using x.\n\nFrom x = p^3 / (2 - p^2), we can write p^3 = x (2 - p^2), so p^3 = 2x - x p^2.\n\nRearranged, p^3 + x p^2 - 2x = 0.\n\nWait, maybe we can express p in terms of x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a relation between x and y without p.\n\nLet me see, perhaps express (1 - p^2) in terms of x.\n\nFrom x = p^3 / (2 - p^2), let's solve for p^3:\n\np^3 = x (2 - p^2)\n\nSo, p^3 + x p^2 = 2x\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the ratio of y and x.\n\nFrom x = p^3 / (2 - p^2), and y = 2 (1 - p^2)^(3/2) / (2 - p^2).\n\nSo, y = 2 (1 - p^2)^(3/2) / (2 - p^2) = 2 (1 - p^2) * sqrt(1 - p^2) / (2 - p^2)\n\nBut 2 - p^2 = (1 - p^2) + 1.\n\nHmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nWait, let's try to express y in terms of x.\n\nWe have x = p^3 / (2 - p^2)\n\nLet me denote p^2 = s, so s is between 0 and 1.\n\nThen, x = p^3 / (2 - s) = p * s / (2 - s)\n\nBut p = sqrt(s), so x = sqrt(s) * s / (2 - s) = s^(3/2) / (2 - s)\n\nSimilarly, y = 2 (1 - s)^(3/2) / (2 - s)\n\nSo, we have:\n\nx = s^(3/2) / (2 - s)\n\ny = 2 (1 - s)^(3/2) / (2 - s)\n\nHmm, perhaps we can find a relation between x and y by eliminating s.\n\nLet me denote u = sqrt(s), so s = u^2, and 1 - s = 1 - u^2.\n\nSo, x = (u^2)^(3/2) / (2 - u^2) = u^3 / (2 - u^2)\n\nSimilarly, y = 2 (1 - u^2)^(3/2) / (2 - u^2)\n\nHmm, perhaps take the ratio of y to x:\n\ny/x = [2 (1 - u^2)^(3/2) / (2 - u^2)] / [ u^3 / (2 - u^2) ) ] = 2 (1 - u^2)^(3/2) / u^3\n\nSo,\n\ny/x = 2 (1 - u^2)^(3/2) / u^3\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that (x, y) lies on the envelope, so it's the solution to the system. Alternatively, perhaps think about parameterizing using trigonometric functions.\n\nWait, since p^2 + q^2 = 1, we can set p = cos\u03b8 and q = sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2.\n\nSo, for each \u03b8, PQ is the line from (cos\u03b8, 0) to (0, sin\u03b8). The equation of PQ is x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) = 1.\n\nSo, the family of lines is x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) = 1, for \u03b8 in (0, \u03c0/2).\n\nNow, to find the envelope, we can use the method of solving for x and y such that both f(\u03b8, x, y) = 0 and df/d\u03b8 = 0.\n\nSo, f(\u03b8, x, y) = x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) - 1 = 0\n\ndf/d\u03b8 = x sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 - y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 0\n\nSo, the system is:\n\n1. x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) = 1\n2. x sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 - y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 0\n\nLet me solve this system.\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\nx sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 = y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\n=> x sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8\n\n=> y = x (sin^3\u03b8)/(cos^3\u03b8) = x tan^3\u03b8\n\nSo, y = x tan^3\u03b8\n\nNow, substitute y into equation 1:\n\nx/cos\u03b8 + (x tan^3\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\nx/cos\u03b8 + x (tan^3\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = 1\n\nExpress tan\u03b8 as sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8:\n\n= x/cos\u03b8 + x ( (sin^3\u03b8)/(cos^3\u03b8) ) / sin\u03b8\n= x/cos\u03b8 + x (sin^2\u03b8)/(cos^3\u03b8)\n= x [ 1/cos\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 / cos^3\u03b8 ]\n= x [ cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 ] / cos^3\u03b8\nBut cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 1, so:\n\n= x (1) / cos^3\u03b8 = 1\n\nThus,\n\nx = cos^3\u03b8\n\nAnd since y = x tan^3\u03b8,\n\ny = cos^3\u03b8 * (sin^3\u03b8 / cos^3\u03b8) ) = sin^3\u03b8\n\nSo, the parametric equations for the envelope are:\n\nx = cos^3\u03b8\n\ny = sin^3\u03b8\n\nSo, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nWait, because if we take x = cos^3\u03b8, y = sin^3\u03b8, then x^(2/3) = cos^2\u03b8, y^(2/3) = sin^2\u03b8, so x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1. So, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nThat's a neat result. So, the envelope of all unit segments PQ is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nNow, the point C is on AB and lies on this astroid. Also, since C is only on AB and no other PQ from F, it must be the point where AB is tangent to the astroid. Because if AB intersects the astroid at a point, that point would be where AB is tangent to the astroid, meaning it's the only point in common between AB and the astroid except for A and B.\n\nWait, but let me check: the astroid is the envelope of all PQ segments, so any point on the astroid lies on exactly one PQ segment from F. So, if point C is on AB and on the astroid, then C lies on AB and on exactly one PQ from F. But the problem states that C lies only on AB and no other PQ in F except AB itself. So, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid, meaning it's the only point of intersection, so it's only on AB and that particular PQ (which is AB itself).\n\nWait, but AB is one of the PQ segments. Because AB is from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check if AB is a PQ segment from F.\n\nCompute the length of AB: sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So, AB is indeed a unit segment, so AB is in F.\n\nSo, AB is one of the PQ segments, so point C is on AB and on the astroid, but it's only on AB and no other PQ from F. So, C must be the point where AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nBecause if AB intersects the astroid at a point other than A and B, that point would lie on another PQ segment, which we don't want. So, the only point where AB touches the astroid without crossing it is where AB is tangent to the astroid. Thus, C is the point of tangency.\n\nSo, to find C, we can find the point where AB is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nWe have the equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2\n\nWe can substitute this into the astroid equation and find where they are tangent, i.e., the system has exactly one solution.\n\nSo, substituting y from AB into the astroid equation:\n\nx^(2/3) + ( (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) )^(2/3) = 1\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but maybe we can parametrize the astroid and AB and find the point of contact.\n\nAlternatively, since the astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1, we can parametrize it using the parametric equations x = cos^3\u03b8, y = sin^3\u03b8 as before.\n\nSo, any point on the astroid is (cos^3\u03b8, sin^3\u03b8). We need this point to lie on AB, whose equation is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nsin^3\u03b8 = -sqrt(3) cos^3\u03b8 + sqrt(3)/2\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nsin^3\u03b8 + sqrt(3) cos^3\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2\n\nHmm, we can factor this as:\n\nsin^3\u03b8 + sqrt(3) cos^3\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2\n\nLet me factor this expression. Perhaps using some trigonometric identity.\n\nAlternatively, let's let t = \u03b8, and write the equation as:\n\nsin^3t + sqrt(3) cos^3t = sqrt(3)/2\n\nWe can factor this as:\n\nsin t (sin^2 t) + sqrt(3) cos t (cos^2 t) = sqrt(3)/2\n\nHmm, perhaps using substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of sin t and cos t, and use the identity sin^2 t + cos^2 t = 1.\n\nLet me try to write the equation as:\n\nsin^3t + sqrt(3) cos^3t = sqrt(3)/2\n\nLet me factor out cos^3t:\n\ncos^3t ( (sin^3t / cos^3t ) + sqrt(3) ) = sqrt(3)/2\n\nHmm, perhaps that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set u = tant, so tant = u.\n\nThen, sint = u / sqrt(1 + u^2), cost = 1 / sqrt(1 + u^2).\n\nBut this might complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that sin^3t + sqrt(3) cos^3t can be written as a combination of sint and cost, perhaps using some angle addition formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps write it as:\n\nsin^3t + sqrt(3) cos^3t = (sint + sqrt(3) cost)(something) = sqrt(3)/2\n\nWait, let me see: Let me compute (sint + sqrt(3) cost)^3.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not the cube, but maybe find a factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me write the equation as:\n\nsin^3t + sqrt(3) cos^3t = sqrt(3)/2\n\nLet me factor this as:\n\nsin^3t + sqrt(3) cos^3t = sqrt(3)/2\n\nHmm, perhaps express as:\n\nsin^3t = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) cos^3t\n\n= sqrt(3) (1/2 - cos^3t )\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me consider that the equation is:\n\nsin^3t + sqrt(3) cos^3t = sqrt(3)/2\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nsin^3t = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) cos^3t\n\n= sqrt(3) (1/2 - cos^3t )\n\nSo,\n\nsin^3t = sqrt(3) (1/2 - cos^3t )\n\nHmm, perhaps I can square both sides, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use substitution. Let me let u = cos t.\n\nThen, sin t = sqrt(1 - u^2), so the equation becomes:\n\n( (1 - u^2)^(3/2) ) + sqrt(3) u^3 = sqrt(3)/2\n\nHmm, but that might not be helpful either.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider the parametric equations for AB.\n\nAB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2\n\nSo, any point on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nThis point must lie on the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nSo, substituting y:\n\nx^(2/3) + ( -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 )^(2/3) = 1\n\nLet me make a substitution to simplify this. Let me set z = x.\n\nSo,\n\nz^(2/3) + ( -sqrt(3) z + sqrt(3)/2 )^(2/3) = 1\n\nHmm, this seems difficult to solve algebraically. Maybe we can make a substitution to simplify.\n\nLet me factor sqrt(3) inside the second term:\n\n= z^(2/3) + ( sqrt(3) (-z + 1/2) )^(2/3 )\n\n= z^(2/3) + (sqrt(3))^(2/3) (-z + 1/2 )^(2/3 )\n\n= z^(2/3) + (3^(1/2))^(2/3) ( (-z + 1/2 ) )^(2/3 )\n\n= z^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) ( (1/2 - z ) )^(2/3 )\n\nHmm, perhaps set u = z, and let me denote v = 1/2 - z. Then, z = 1/2 - v.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this substitution helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set w = z^(1/3), so z = w^3, and similarly for the other term.\n\nLet me try that:\n\nz^(2/3) = (w^3)^(2/3) = w^2\n\nSimilarly, (1/2 - z )^(2/3) = ( (1/2 - w^3 ) )^(2/3 )\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nw^2 + 3^(1/3) * (1/2 - w^3 )^(2/3) = 1\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that the point of contact is at some symmetric position or has some relation to the angle \u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use calculus to find where AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nThe astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1 can be expressed parametrically as x = cos^3\u03b8, y = sin^3\u03b8.\n\nThe derivative dy/dx for the astroid can be found by differentiating both sides with respect to \u03b8:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) dx/d\u03b8 + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/d\u03b8 = 0\n\nSo,\n\ndy/dx = - (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3) )\n\nAt the point of contact, the slope of AB must equal the slope of the astroid at that point.\n\nThe slope of AB is -sqrt(3), as we found earlier.\n\nSo, at the point of contact, the derivative of the astroid is dy/dx = -sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\n- (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3) ) = -sqrt(3)\n\n=> y^(1/3) / x^(1/3) = sqrt(3)\n\n=> (y/x)^(1/3) = sqrt(3)\n\n=> y/x = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3*sqrt(3)\n\n=> y = 3*sqrt(3) x\n\nBut the point also lies on AB, which has equation y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2\n\nSo,\n\n3*sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2\n\nLet me solve for x:\n\n3\u221a3 x + \u221a3 x = \u221a3/2\n\n=> (4\u221a3 x) = \u221a3/2\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a3:\n\n4x = 1/2\n\n=> x = 1/8\n\nSo, x = 1/8.\n\nNow, substitute back into y = 3\u221a3 x:\n\ny = 3\u221a3 * (1/8) = (3\u221a3)/8\n\nSo, the point C is at (1/8, 3\u221a3/8 )\n\nNow, let's verify that this point lies on the astroid:\n\nx^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = ( (1/8) )^(2/3) + ( (3\u221a3/8) )^(2/3 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/8)^(2/3) = ( (1/8)^(1/3) )^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n\nSimilarly, (3\u221a3/8)^(2/3):\n\nFirst, 3\u221a3 = 3 * 3^(1/2) = 3^(3/2)\n\nSo, 3\u221a3/8 = 3^(3/2) / 8\n\nSo, (3^(3/2)/8 )^(2/3) = (3^(3/2))^(2/3) / (8)^(2/3) ) = 3^( (3/2)*(2/3) ) / (8^(2/3)) ) = 3^1 / (4) ) = 3/4\n\nSo, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1, which satisfies the astroid equation.\n\nAlso, check if it lies on AB:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2\n\nPlug x = 1/8:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8 ) = (3 sqrt(3))/8\n\nWhich matches. So, point C is indeed at (1/8, 3\u221a3/8 )\n\nNow, we need to compute OC\u00b2, which is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2.\n\nx = 1/8, so x\u00b2 = 1/64\n\ny = 3\u221a3/8, so y\u00b2 = (9 * 3) / 64 = 27/64\n\nSo, OC\u00b2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16\n\nWait, 1 + 27 is 28, so 28/64 simplifies to 7/16. So, OC\u00b2 = 7/16.\n\nSo, p = 7 and q = 16, which are coprime.\n\nThus, p + q = 7 + 16 = 23.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, when I computed y\u00b2, (3\u221a3/8)^2 is indeed (9 * 3)/64 = 27/64. Then x\u00b2 is (1/8)^2 = 1/64. Adding them gives 28/64, which reduces to 7/16. So, yes, OC\u00b2 is 7/16, and p + q is 7 + 16 = 23.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that point C is indeed the only point on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ from F except AB itself.\n\nSince the astroid is the envelope, and C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid, it means that C is the only point where AB touches the astroid, so it's the only point on AB that lies on any PQ from F, which is AB itself. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 23.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we first determine the equation of line segment $\\overline{AB}$. Points $A$ and $B$ are at $(\\tfrac{1}{2}, 0)$ and $(0, \\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})$ respectively. The slope of $\\overline{AB}$ is $-\\sqrt{3}$, leading to the equation $y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nNext, we consider the family $\\mathcal{F}$ of unit-length segments $\\overline{PQ}$ with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. Each segment $\\overline{PQ}$ satisfies $p^2 + q^2 = 1$ where $P = (p, 0)$ and $Q = (0, q)$. The equation of $\\overline{PQ}$ is $\\tfrac{x}{p} + \\tfrac{y}{q} = 1$.\n\nTo find the envelope of these segments, we use the method of solving the system of equations derived from the curve and its derivative with respect to the parameter. This results in the parametric equations $x = \\cos^3\\theta$ and $y = \\sin^3\\theta$, which describe the astroid $x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1$.\n\nWe then find the point $C$ where $\\overline{AB}$ is tangent to this astroid.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nWe have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These points define a line segment AB. Then there's this family F of segments PQ, each of unit length, lying in the first quadrant. Each P is on the x-axis, and each Q is on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a unit segment connecting a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis in the first quadrant.\n\nThe problem states that there's a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that isn't on any other segment from F except for AB itself. So, C is a point on AB that isn't covered by any other unit segment PQ from the family F. We need to find OC\u00b2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Then find p + q.\n\nHmm. So, the key is to find point C on AB such that it's not covered by any other segment in F except AB. That means for any other unit segment PQ in F, C doesn't lie on PQ. So, C is only on AB and no other PQ in F.\n\nFirst, let me visualize this. Points O, A, and B form a triangle in the first quadrant. AB is the line segment between A (1/2, 0) and B (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of all possible unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. So, each PQ is a line from (p, 0) to (0, q), with sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, since it's a unit length.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the length of PQ is 1. So, if P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), then the distance between P and Q is sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1. So, for any such PQ, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, each PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q) where p and q satisfy p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, all these segments lie in the first quadrant, connecting the x and y-axes.\n\nNow, the point C is on AB, and it's the unique point (other than A and B) that doesn't lie on any other PQ from F except AB itself. So, if I can find such a point C on AB, then OC\u00b2 is what we're looking for.\n\nSo, I think I need to parametrize AB first. Let's find the equation of AB.\n\nPoints A and B are (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplifying, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) where x is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nNow, we need to find point C such that it's not on any other PQ in F except AB. So, for any other PQ in F, which is a unit segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), C does not lie on PQ.\n\nSo, our strategy might be to find C on AB such that the line PQ (for some p, q with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1) passes through C, but for C, this only happens when PQ is AB itself.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parametrize all possible PQ segments, find the condition that C lies on PQ, and then enforce that this condition is only satisfied when PQ is AB. Then, solve for C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think about the envelope of all such PQ segments, and find where AB intersects this envelope, but since C is the only point (other than A and B) on AB not covered by any other PQ, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.\n\nWait, maybe that's a better approach. The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. If we can find the envelope of the family F, then the points where AB intersects this envelope would be the points where AB is tangent to the envelope, which would mean that those points are only on AB and not on any other PQ in F.\n\nSo, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.\n\nLet me try to find the envelope of F.\n\nEach PQ is a line from (p, 0) to (0, q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1. Because it's the intercept form of the line equation.\n\nSo, the equation is x/p + y/q = 1, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, the family of curves is F: x/p + y/q = 1, with the condition p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nTo find the envelope, we can use the method where we solve for p and q in terms of x and y, then eliminate p and q to find the equation of the envelope.\n\nAlternatively, we can use Lagrange multipliers to find the envelope.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the standard method for finding envelopes of a family of curves. The envelope satisfies both the original equation and the derivative with respect to the parameter set to zero.\n\nBut in this case, the family is parameterized by p, with q determined by p via p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2), but since we're in the first quadrant, q is positive.\n\nSo, for each p, q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2), so the equation of PQ is x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 1.\n\nSo, the family of lines is given by f(p, x, y) = x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) - 1 = 0.\n\nTo find the envelope, we need to solve for x and y such that f(p, x, y) = 0 and df/dp = 0.\n\nSo, compute df/dp:\n\ndf/dp = -x/p\u00b2 + y * (1/(2)(1 - p\u00b2)^(-3/2) * (p)) ) = 0.\n\nSimplify this:\n\n- x/p\u00b2 + (y p)/(2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)) ) = 0.\n\nSo, set up the system:\n\n1. x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 1\n2. -x/p\u00b2 + (y p)/(2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)) ) = 0\n\nLet me try to solve this system for x and y in terms of p.\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\n- x/p\u00b2 + (y p)/(2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)) ) = 0\n\n=> (y p)/(2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)) ) = x/p\u00b2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2):\n\ny p = 2 x p\u00b2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) / p\u00b2\n\nWait, wait, let me check that again. Wait, if I have (y p)/(2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)) ) = x/p\u00b2, then cross-multiplying gives:\n\ny p * p\u00b2 = 2 x (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)\n\nSo, y p^3 = 2 x (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)\n\nSo, x = (y p^3) / (2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)) )\n\nNow, substitute this into equation 1:\n\nx/p + y/sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 1\n\nSubstituting x:\n\n( (y p^3)/(2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)) ) / p ) + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\n( y p^2 )/( 2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) ) ) + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 1\n\nFactor out y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2):\n\ny / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) [ p^2/(2(1 - p^2)) + 1 ] = 1\n\nLet me compute the term in the brackets:\n\np^2/(2(1 - p^2)) + 1 = [ p^2 + 2(1 - p^2) ] / [2(1 - p^2) ]\n\n= [ p^2 + 2 - 2 p^2 ] / [2(1 - p^2) ]\n\n= (2 - p^2) / [2(1 - p^2) ]\n\nSo, putting it back:\n\ny / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) * (2 - p^2)/(2(1 - p^2)) ) = 1\n\nMultiply the denominators:\n\nsqrt(1 - p^2) is (1 - p^2)^(1/2), so denominator becomes 2(1 - p^2)^(3/2).\n\nSo,\n\ny * (2 - p^2) / [2(1 - p^2)^(3/2)] ) = 1\n\nSolve for y:\n\ny = [2(1 - p^2)^(3/2)] / (2 - p^2)\n\nSimilarly, from earlier, x = (y p^3) / (2 (1 - p^2)^(3/2)) )\n\nSubstituting y:\n\nx = [ 2(1 - p^2)^(3/2) / (2 - p^2) ) * p^3 ] / [ 2 (1 - p^2)^(3/2) ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nx = [ (2 (1 - p^2)^(3/2) ) * p^3 ) / (2 - p^2) ) ] / [ 2 (1 - p^2)^(3/2) ) ]\n\nThe (1 - p^2)^(3/2) terms cancel out, so:\n\nx = [ 2 p^3 / (2 - p^2) ) ] / 2 = (2 p^3) / (2 - p^2) ) * (1/2) ) = p^3 / (2 - p^2)\n\nSo, x = p^3 / (2 - p^2) and y = [2 (1 - p^2)^(3/2) ] / (2 - p^2)\n\nNow, to eliminate p and find the envelope's equation, let's express in terms of x and y.\n\nLet me denote s = p^2, so s ranges from 0 to 1 because p is in (0,1).\n\nSo, x = p^3 / (2 - p^2) = p * (p^2) / (2 - p^2) ) = p * s / (2 - s)\n\nSimilarly, y = 2 (1 - s)^(3/2) / (2 - s)\n\nBut perhaps we can relate x and y without s.\n\nLet me see.\n\nWe have x = p^3 / (2 - p^2) and y = 2 (1 - p^2)^(3/2) / (2 - p^2)\n\nLet me express (1 - p^2) as t, so t = 1 - p^2. Then p^2 = 1 - t.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nx = p^3 / (2 - (1 - t)) ) = p^3 / (1 + t)\n\nBut t = 1 - p^2, so t = 1 - (1 - t) => Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to express p in terms of x and y.\n\nFrom x = p^3 / (2 - p^2), let's solve for p.\n\nMultiply both sides by (2 - p^2):\n\nx (2 - p^2) = p^3\n\n=> 2x - x p^2 = p^3\n\n=> p^3 + x p^2 - 2x = 0\n\nHmm, this is a cubic equation in p, which might be difficult to solve directly. Maybe we can find a relationship between x and y.\n\nWait, from y = 2 (1 - p^2)^(3/2) / (2 - p^2), let's square both sides:\n\ny^2 = [4 (1 - p^2)^3 ] / (2 - p^2)^2\n\nSo,\n\ny^2 (2 - p^2)^2 = 4 (1 - p^2)^3\n\nLet me expand (2 - p^2)^2:\n\n= 4 - 4 p^2 + p^4\n\nSo,\n\ny^2 (4 - 4 p^2 + p^4) = 4 (1 - 3 p^2 + 3 p^4 - p^6 )\n\nHmm, this might get complicated, but maybe we can find a relation using x.\n\nFrom x = p^3 / (2 - p^2), we can write p^3 = x (2 - p^2), so p^3 = 2x - x p^2.\n\nRearranged, p^3 + x p^2 - 2x = 0.\n\nWait, maybe we can express p in terms of x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a relation between x and y without p.\n\nLet me see, perhaps express (1 - p^2) in terms of x.\n\nFrom x = p^3 / (2 - p^2), let's solve for p^3:\n\np^3 = x (2 - p^2)\n\nSo, p^3 + x p^2 = 2x\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the ratio of y and x.\n\nFrom x = p^3 / (2 - p^2), and y = 2 (1 - p^2)^(3/2) / (2 - p^2).\n\nSo, y = 2 (1 - p^2)^(3/2) / (2 - p^2) = 2 (1 - p^2) * sqrt(1 - p^2) / (2 - p^2)\n\nBut 2 - p^2 = (1 - p^2) + 1.\n\nHmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nWait, let's try to express y in terms of x.\n\nWe have x = p^3 / (2 - p^2)\n\nLet me denote p^2 = s, so s is between 0 and 1.\n\nThen, x = p^3 / (2 - s) = p * s / (2 - s)\n\nBut p = sqrt(s), so x = sqrt(s) * s / (2 - s) = s^(3/2) / (2 - s)\n\nSimilarly, y = 2 (1 - s)^(3/2) / (2 - s)\n\nSo, we have:\n\nx = s^(3/2) / (2 - s)\n\ny = 2 (1 - s)^(3/2) / (2 - s)\n\nHmm, perhaps we can find a relation between x and y by eliminating s.\n\nLet me denote u = sqrt(s), so s = u^2, and 1 - s = 1 - u^2.\n\nSo, x = (u^2)^(3/2) / (2 - u^2) = u^3 / (2 - u^2)\n\nSimilarly, y = 2 (1 - u^2)^(3/2) / (2 - u^2)\n\nHmm, perhaps take the ratio of y to x:\n\ny/x = [2 (1 - u^2)^(3/2) / (2 - u^2)] / [ u^3 / (2 - u^2) ) ] = 2 (1 - u^2)^(3/2) / u^3\n\nSo,\n\ny/x = 2 (1 - u^2)^(3/2) / u^3\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that (x, y) lies on the envelope, so it's the solution to the system. Alternatively, perhaps think about parameterizing using trigonometric functions.\n\nWait, since p^2 + q^2 = 1, we can set p = cos\u03b8 and q = sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2.\n\nSo, for each \u03b8, PQ is the line from (cos\u03b8, 0) to (0, sin\u03b8). The equation of PQ is x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) = 1.\n\nSo, the family of lines is x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) = 1, for \u03b8 in (0, \u03c0/2).\n\nNow, to find the envelope, we can use the method of solving for x and y such that both f(\u03b8, x, y) = 0 and df/d\u03b8 = 0.\n\nSo, f(\u03b8, x, y) = x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) - 1 = 0\n\ndf/d\u03b8 = x sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 - y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 0\n\nSo, the system is:\n\n1. x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) = 1\n2. x sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 - y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 0\n\nLet me solve this system.\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\nx sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 = y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\n=> x sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8\n\n=> y = x (sin^3\u03b8)/(cos^3\u03b8) = x tan^3\u03b8\n\nSo, y = x tan^3\u03b8\n\nNow, substitute y into equation 1:\n\nx/cos\u03b8 + (x tan^3\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\nx/cos\u03b8 + x (tan^3\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = 1\n\nExpress tan\u03b8 as sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8:\n\n= x/cos\u03b8 + x ( (sin^3\u03b8)/(cos^3\u03b8) ) / sin\u03b8\n= x/cos\u03b8 + x (sin^2\u03b8)/(cos^3\u03b8)\n= x [ 1/cos\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 / cos^3\u03b8 ]\n= x [ cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 ] / cos^3\u03b8\nBut cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 1, so:\n\n= x (1) / cos^3\u03b8 = 1\n\nThus,\n\nx = cos^3\u03b8\n\nAnd since y = x tan^3\u03b8,\n\ny = cos^3\u03b8 * (sin^3\u03b8 / cos^3\u03b8) ) = sin^3\u03b8\n\nSo, the parametric equations for the envelope are:\n\nx = cos^3\u03b8\n\ny = sin^3\u03b8\n\nSo, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nWait, because if we take x = cos^3\u03b8, y = sin^3\u03b8, then x^(2/3) = cos^2\u03b8, y^(2/3) = sin^2\u03b8, so x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1. So, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nThat's a neat result. So, the envelope of all unit segments PQ is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nNow, the point C is on AB and lies on this astroid. Also, since C is only on AB and no other PQ from F, it must be the point where AB is tangent to the astroid. Because if AB intersects the astroid at a point, that point would be where AB is tangent to the astroid, meaning it's the only point in common between AB and the astroid except for A and B.\n\nWait, but let me check: the astroid is the envelope of all PQ segments, so any point on the astroid lies on exactly one PQ segment from F. So, if point C is on AB and on the astroid, then C lies on AB and on exactly one PQ from F. But the problem states that C lies only on AB and no other PQ in F except AB itself. So, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid, meaning it's the only point of intersection, so it's only on AB and that particular PQ (which is AB itself).\n\nWait, but AB is one of the PQ segments. Because AB is from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check if AB is a PQ segment from F.\n\nCompute the length of AB: sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So, AB is indeed a unit segment, so AB is in F.\n\nSo, AB is one of the PQ segments, so point C is on AB and on the astroid, but it's only on AB and no other PQ from F. So, C must be the point where AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nBecause if AB intersects the astroid at a point other than A and B, that point would lie on another PQ segment, which we don't want. So, the only point where AB touches the astroid without crossing it is where AB is tangent to the astroid. Thus, C is the point of tangency.\n\nSo, to find C, we can find the point where AB is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nWe have the equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2\n\nWe can substitute this into the astroid equation and find where they are tangent, i.e., the system has exactly one solution.\n\nSo, substituting y from AB into the astroid equation:\n\nx^(2/3) + ( (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) )^(2/3) = 1\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but maybe we can parametrize the astroid and AB and find the point of contact.\n\nAlternatively, since the astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1, we can parametrize it using the parametric equations x = cos^3\u03b8, y = sin^3\u03b8 as before.\n\nSo, any point on the astroid is (cos^3\u03b8, sin^3\u03b8). We need this point to lie on AB, whose equation is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nsin^3\u03b8 = -sqrt(3) cos^3\u03b8 + sqrt(3)/2\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nsin^3\u03b8 + sqrt(3) cos^3\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2\n\nHmm, we can factor this as:\n\nsin^3\u03b8 + sqrt(3) cos^3\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2\n\nLet me factor this expression. Perhaps using some trigonometric identity.\n\nAlternatively, let's let t = \u03b8, and write the equation as:\n\nsin^3t + sqrt(3) cos^3t = sqrt(3)/2\n\nWe can factor this as:\n\nsin t (sin^2 t) + sqrt(3) cos t (cos^2 t) = sqrt(3)/2\n\nHmm, perhaps using substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of sin t and cos t, and use the identity sin^2 t + cos^2 t = 1.\n\nLet me try to write the equation as:\n\nsin^3t + sqrt(3) cos^3t = sqrt(3)/2\n\nLet me factor out cos^3t:\n\ncos^3t ( (sin^3t / cos^3t ) + sqrt(3) ) = sqrt(3)/2\n\nHmm, perhaps that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set u = tant, so tant = u.\n\nThen, sint = u / sqrt(1 + u^2), cost = 1 / sqrt(1 + u^2).\n\nBut this might complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that sin^3t + sqrt(3) cos^3t can be written as a combination of sint and cost, perhaps using some angle addition formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps write it as:\n\nsin^3t + sqrt(3) cos^3t = (sint + sqrt(3) cost)(something) = sqrt(3)/2\n\nWait, let me see: Let me compute (sint + sqrt(3) cost)^3.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not the cube, but maybe find a factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me write the equation as:\n\nsin^3t + sqrt(3) cos^3t = sqrt(3)/2\n\nLet me factor this as:\n\nsin^3t + sqrt(3) cos^3t = sqrt(3)/2\n\nHmm, perhaps express as:\n\nsin^3t = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) cos^3t\n\n= sqrt(3) (1/2 - cos^3t )\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me consider that the equation is:\n\nsin^3t + sqrt(3) cos^3t = sqrt(3)/2\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nsin^3t = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) cos^3t\n\n= sqrt(3) (1/2 - cos^3t )\n\nSo,\n\nsin^3t = sqrt(3) (1/2 - cos^3t )\n\nHmm, perhaps I can square both sides, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use substitution. Let me let u = cos t.\n\nThen, sin t = sqrt(1 - u^2), so the equation becomes:\n\n( (1 - u^2)^(3/2) ) + sqrt(3) u^3 = sqrt(3)/2\n\nHmm, but that might not be helpful either.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider the parametric equations for AB.\n\nAB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2\n\nSo, any point on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nThis point must lie on the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nSo, substituting y:\n\nx^(2/3) + ( -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 )^(2/3) = 1\n\nLet me make a substitution to simplify this. Let me set z = x.\n\nSo,\n\nz^(2/3) + ( -sqrt(3) z + sqrt(3)/2 )^(2/3) = 1\n\nHmm, this seems difficult to solve algebraically. Maybe we can make a substitution to simplify.\n\nLet me factor sqrt(3) inside the second term:\n\n= z^(2/3) + ( sqrt(3) (-z + 1/2) )^(2/3 )\n\n= z^(2/3) + (sqrt(3))^(2/3) (-z + 1/2 )^(2/3 )\n\n= z^(2/3) + (3^(1/2))^(2/3) ( (-z + 1/2 ) )^(2/3 )\n\n= z^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) ( (1/2 - z ) )^(2/3 )\n\nHmm, perhaps set u = z, and let me denote v = 1/2 - z. Then, z = 1/2 - v.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this substitution helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set w = z^(1/3), so z = w^3, and similarly for the other term.\n\nLet me try that:\n\nz^(2/3) = (w^3)^(2/3) = w^2\n\nSimilarly, (1/2 - z )^(2/3) = ( (1/2 - w^3 ) )^(2/3 )\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nw^2 + 3^(1/3) * (1/2 - w^3 )^(2/3) = 1\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that the point of contact is at some symmetric position or has some relation to the angle \u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use calculus to find where AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nThe astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1 can be expressed parametrically as x = cos^3\u03b8, y = sin^3\u03b8.\n\nThe derivative dy/dx for the astroid can be found by differentiating both sides with respect to \u03b8:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) dx/d\u03b8 + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/d\u03b8 = 0\n\nSo,\n\ndy/dx = - (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3) )\n\nAt the point of contact, the slope of AB must equal the slope of the astroid at that point.\n\nThe slope of AB is -sqrt(3), as we found earlier.\n\nSo, at the point of contact, the derivative of the astroid is dy/dx = -sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\n- (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3) ) = -sqrt(3)\n\n=> y^(1/3) / x^(1/3) = sqrt(3)\n\n=> (y/x)^(1/3) = sqrt(3)\n\n=> y/x = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3*sqrt(3)\n\n=> y = 3*sqrt(3) x\n\nBut the point also lies on AB, which has equation y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2\n\nSo,\n\n3*sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2\n\nLet me solve for x:\n\n3\u221a3 x + \u221a3 x = \u221a3/2\n\n=> (4\u221a3 x) = \u221a3/2\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a3:\n\n4x = 1/2\n\n=> x = 1/8\n\nSo, x = 1/8.\n\nNow, substitute back into y = 3\u221a3 x:\n\ny = 3\u221a3 * (1/8) = (3\u221a3)/8\n\nSo, the point C is at (1/8, 3\u221a3/8 )\n\nNow, let's verify that this point lies on the astroid:\n\nx^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = ( (1/8) )^(2/3) + ( (3\u221a3/8) )^(2/3 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/8)^(2/3) = ( (1/8)^(1/3) )^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n\nSimilarly, (3\u221a3/8)^(2/3):\n\nFirst, 3\u221a3 = 3 * 3^(1/2) = 3^(3/2)\n\nSo, 3\u221a3/8 = 3^(3/2) / 8\n\nSo, (3^(3/2)/8 )^(2/3) = (3^(3/2))^(2/3) / (8)^(2/3) ) = 3^( (3/2)*(2/3) ) / (8^(2/3)) ) = 3^1 / (4) ) = 3/4\n\nSo, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1, which satisfies the astroid equation.\n\nAlso, check if it lies on AB:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2\n\nPlug x = 1/8:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8 ) = (3 sqrt(3))/8\n\nWhich matches. So, point C is indeed at (1/8, 3\u221a3/8 )\n\nNow, we need to compute OC\u00b2, which is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2.\n\nx = 1/8, so x\u00b2 = 1/64\n\ny = 3\u221a3/8, so y\u00b2 = (9 * 3) / 64 = 27/64\n\nSo, OC\u00b2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16\n\nWait, 1 + 27 is 28, so 28/64 simplifies to 7/16. So, OC\u00b2 = 7/16.\n\nSo, p = 7 and q = 16, which are coprime.\n\nThus, p + q = 7 + 16 = 23.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, when I computed y\u00b2, (3\u221a3/8)^2 is indeed (9 * 3)/64 = 27/64. Then x\u00b2 is (1/8)^2 = 1/64. Adding them gives 28/64, which reduces to 7/16. So, yes, OC\u00b2 is 7/16, and p + q is 7 + 16 = 23.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that point C is indeed the only point on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ from F except AB itself.\n\nSince the astroid is the envelope, and C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid, it means that C is the only point where AB touches the astroid, so it's the only point on AB that lies on any PQ from F, which is AB itself. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 23.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first determine the equation of line segment $\\overline{AB}$. Points $A$ and $B$ are at $(\\tfrac{1}{2}, 0)$ and $(0, \\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})$ respectively. The slope of $\\overline{AB}$ is $-\\sqrt{3}$, leading to the equation $y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nNext, we consider the family $\\mathcal{F}$ of unit-length segments $\\overline{PQ}$ with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. Each segment $\\overline{PQ}$ satisfies $p^2 + q^2 = 1$ where $P = (p, 0)$ and $Q = (0, q)$. The equation of $\\overline{PQ}$ is $\\tfrac{x}{p} + \\tfrac{y}{q} = 1$.\n\nTo find the envelope of these segments, we use the method of solving the system of equations derived from the curve and its derivative with respect to the parameter. This results in the parametric equations $x = \\cos^3\\theta$ and $y = \\sin^3\\theta$, which describe the astroid $x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1$.\n\nWe then find the point $C$ where $\\overline{AB}$ is tangent to this astroid. By substituting the equation of $\\overline{AB}$ into the astroid equation and solving for the point of tangency, we find $C$ at $(\\tfrac{1}{8}, \\tfrac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8})$.\n\nFinally, we calculate $OC^2$ as the sum of the squares of the coordinates of $C$:\n\\[\nOC^2 = \\left(\\tfrac{1}{8}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\tfrac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\right)^2 = \\tfrac{1}{64} + \\tfrac{27}{64} = \\tfrac{28}{64} = \\tfrac{7}{16}.\n\\]\nThus, $OC^2 = \\tfrac{7}{16}$, and the sum of the numerator and denominator is $7 + 16 = 23$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{23}$.",

It's a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step. \n\nFirst, let's parse the problem:\n\nWe have points O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. The segment AB is probably the line connecting these two points. \n\nThen, we have a family F of segments PQ, each of unit length, lying in the first quadrant. Each P is on the x-axis, each Q is on the y-axis. So, for each PQ in F, P is (p,0) and Q is (0,q), with the distance between P and Q being 1. \n\nSince the distance between P and Q is 1, we can write the equation sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1, so p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) where p and q satisfy p^2 + q^2 = 1. \n\nSo, the family F consists of all such segments PQ in the first quadrant with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, and PQ has unit length. \n\nNow, we're told that there's a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that doesn't lie on any segment from F except AB itself. So, AB is in F since A and B are on the axes, and AB has length 1, as we can check. \n\nWait, let me confirm that: the distance from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2) is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment of F. \n\nSo, AB is one such segment in F. The point C is on AB, but not on any other segment from F. So, for all other segments PQ in F, C is not on PQ. \n\nWe need to find the point C on AB such that OC\u00b2 is p/q, with p and q coprime, and then find p+q.\n\nSo, first, let's parametrize AB. Let's find the equation of AB. \n\nPoints A(1/2,0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). \n\nSo, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Plugging in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So, equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. \n\nSo, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x is between 0 and 1/2. \n\nOur point C is on AB, so we can write C as (x, sqrt(3)(1/2 - x)). \n\nNow, we need to find such a point C that doesn't lie on any other segment PQ in F except AB. \n\nSo, for any other segment PQ in F, C should not be on PQ. \n\nSo, perhaps we can find the condition where C is not on any other PQ, meaning that for C, the equation of PQ (if any) would require C to lie on it, but we can find such a point C where this is impossible except for AB itself. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think about the envelope of all such segments PQ in F. The point C would lie on AB but not on any other PQ, so it's a point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F. \n\nHmm, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. But in this case, F is a family of line segments, not curves, but perhaps the envelope is a curve that each PQ is tangent to.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the family F and find the envelope.\n\nLet me think. Each PQ is a segment from (p,0) to (0,q), with p^2 + q^2 =1. So, each PQ is a line segment in the first quadrant. The equation of PQ can be written in intercept form: x/p + y/q = 1.\n\nSince p^2 + q^2 =1, we can write q = sqrt(1 - p^2). But p can vary from 0 to 1, so q varies from 1 to 0.\n\nSo, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) =1.\n\nNow, the family of lines is given by x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1, where p is a parameter between 0 and1.\n\nTo find the envelope of this family, we can use the standard method: take F(p,x,y) = x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) -1 =0.\n\nThe envelope satisfies F(p,x,y)=0 and dF/dp=0.\n\nCompute dF/dp: dF/dp = -x/p\u00b2 + (y * (p/(sqrt(1 - p^2)))) / (1 - p^2) - 0.\n\nWait, let me compute it correctly.\n\nF(p) = x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p^2) -1.\n\nSo, dF/dp = -x/p\u00b2 + (y * ( (1/2)(1 - p^2)^(-1/2) * 2p )) / (1 - p^2).\n\nWait, no. Let me compute the derivative correctly.\n\nd/dp [x/p] = -x / p\u00b2.\n\nd/dp [y / sqrt(1 - p^2)] = y * d/dp [ (1 - p^2)^(-1/2) ) ] = y * (-1/2)(1 - p^2)^(-3/2) * (-2p) ) = y * p (1 - p^2)^(-3/2).\n\nSo, dF/dp = -x / p\u00b2 + y * p / (1 - p^2)^(3/2) =0.\n\nSo, the envelope satisfies both F(p,x,y)=0 and dF/dp=0.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p^2) =1.\n\n2. -x / p\u00b2 + y * p / (1 - p^2)^(3/2) =0.\n\nWe can solve these two equations to find the envelope.\n\nLet me denote s = p^2 for simplification, but maybe it's better to solve for x and y in terms of p.\n\nFrom equation 2: -x / p\u00b2 + y p / (1 - p^2)^(3/2) =0.\n\nSo, y p / (1 - p^2)^(3/2) = x / p\u00b2.\n\nSo, x = y p^3 / (1 - p^2)^(3/2).\n\nNow, substitute x into equation 1:\n\nx/p + y / sqrt(1 - p^2) =1.\n\nSubstitute x:\n\n[ y p^3 / (1 - p^2)^(3/2) ] / p + y / sqrt(1 - p^2) =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\ny p^2 / (1 - p^2)^(3/2) + y / sqrt(1 - p^2) =1.\n\nFactor out y / sqrt(1 - p^2):\n\ny / sqrt(1 - p^2) [ p^2 / (1 - p^2) + 1 ] =1.\n\nSimplify the term in brackets:\n\np^2 / (1 - p^2) +1 = [p^2 + (1 - p^2)] / (1 - p^2) = 1 / (1 - p^2).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\ny / sqrt(1 - p^2) * [1 / (1 - p^2)] =1.\n\nWhich is:\n\ny / (1 - p^2)^(3/2) =1.\n\nSo, y = (1 - p^2)^(3/2).\n\nNow, from equation 2, x = y p^3 / (1 - p^2)^(3/2) = [ (1 - p^2)^(3/2) ) * p^3 ] / (1 - p^2)^(3/2) ) = p^3.\n\nSo, we have x = p^3 and y = (1 - p^2)^(3/2).\n\nSo, the envelope is parametrized by p as (p^3, (1 - p^2)^(3/2)).\n\nWe can eliminate p to find the Cartesian equation.\n\nLet me express y in terms of x.\n\nGiven x = p^3, so p = x^(1/3).\n\nThen, y = (1 - (x^(1/3))^2 )^(3/2) = (1 - x^(2/3) )^(3/2).\n\nSo, y = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2).\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as y\u00b2 = (1 - x^(2/3))^3.\n\nSo, the envelope is the curve y\u00b2 = (1 - x^(2/3))^3.\n\nAlternatively, this is the astroid curve.\n\nWait, the standard astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1, but this seems different. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nIf I cube both sides: y^4 = (1 - x^(2/3))^3.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different form.\n\nBut regardless, the envelope is this curve.\n\nNow, the point C is on AB and on the envelope, but since C is not on any other PQ except AB, perhaps AB is tangent to the envelope at point C.\n\nSo, AB is a line, and the envelope is a curve. If they are tangent, then C is the point of tangency.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find the point where AB is tangent to the envelope.\n\nSo, let's find the intersection of AB and the envelope, and impose that they are tangent, meaning the system has a double root.\n\nSo, AB has equation y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nThe envelope has equation y\u00b2 = (1 - x^(2/3))^3.\n\nSubstitute y from AB into the envelope equation.\n\nSo, [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^2 = (1 - x^(2/3))^3.\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\n[ sqrt(3)( -x + 1/2 ) ]^2 = 3( -x + 1/2 )^2 = 3(x^2 - x + 1/4).\n\nRight side: (1 - x^(2/3))^3.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n3x\u00b2 - 3x + 3/4 = (1 - x^(2/3))^3.\n\nLet me denote t = x^(1/3). Then, x = t^3, and x^(2/3) = t^2.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nLeft side: 3(t^3)^2 - 3(t^3) + 3/4 = 3t^6 - 3t^3 + 3/4.\n\nRight side: (1 - t^2)^3 = 1 - 3t^2 + 3t^4 - t^6.\n\nSo, equation: 3t^6 - 3t^3 + 3/4 = 1 - 3t^2 + 3t^4 - t^6.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n3t^6 -3t^3 +3/4 -1 +3t^2 -3t^4 +t^6=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(3t^6 + t^6) + (-3t^4) + (3t^2) + (-3t^3) + (3/4 -1) =0.\n\nSo:\n\n4t^6 -3t^4 +3t^2 -3t^3 -1/4=0.\n\nHmm, this is a 6th-degree polynomial in t, which seems complicated. Maybe I made a substitution mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Since the point C is on both AB and the envelope, and it's the point of tangency, the system should have a double root. So, perhaps we can set up the equation and find the discriminant to be zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to parametrize AB and find where it intersects the envelope, then impose that it's a tangent point.\n\nWait, let's parametrize AB. Let me write AB as parametric equations.\n\nAB goes from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's let parameter s go from 0 to1, with s=0 at A and s=1 at B.\n\nSo, parametric equations:\n\nx = (1/2)(1 - s).\n\ny = (sqrt(3)/2)s.\n\nSo, any point on AB is ( (1/2)(1 - s), (sqrt(3)/2)s ), where s \u2208 [0,1].\n\nNow, we want this point to lie on the envelope, which has equation y\u00b2 = (1 - x^(2/3))^3.\n\nSubstituting x and y:\n\n[ (sqrt(3)/2 s ) ]^2 = (1 - [ (1/2)(1 - s) ]^(2/3) )^3.\n\nCompute left side: (3/4)s\u00b2.\n\nRight side: [1 - ( (1/2)(1 - s) )^(2/3) ]^3.\n\nLet me write this equation:\n\n(3/4)s\u00b2 = [1 - ( (1/2)(1 - s) )^(2/3) ]^3.\n\nLet me denote u = (1/2)(1 - s). Then, 1 - s = 2u, so s = 1 - 2u.\n\nSo, substituting u:\n\nLeft side: (3/4)(1 - 2u)^2.\n\nRight side: [1 - u^(2/3) ]^3.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(3/4)(1 - 4u +4u\u00b2) = [1 - u^(2/3)]^3.\n\nHmm, but this might not help much. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to let t = s, and write the equation as:\n\n(3/4) t\u00b2 = [1 - ( (1/2)(1 - t) )^(2/3) ]^3.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can find a value of t that satisfies this equation, and also the derivative of AB equals the derivative of the envelope at that point, ensuring tangency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can take derivatives.\n\nWait, let's compute the derivative of the envelope at the point (x,y). We have the parametric equations x = p^3, y = (1 - p^2)^(3/2). So, dy/dx is (dy/dp)/(dx/dp).\n\nCompute dy/dp: d/dp [ (1 - p^2)^(3/2) ) ] = (3/2)(1 - p^2)^(1/2)(-2p) ) = -3p (1 - p^2)^(1/2).\n\ndx/dp: d/dp [p^3] = 3p^2.\n\nSo, dy/dx = [ -3p (1 - p^2)^(1/2) ] / [3p^2 ] = - (1 - p^2)^(1/2) / p.\n\nSo, the slope of the envelope at any point p is -sqrt(1 - p^2)/p.\n\nNow, the line AB has slope -sqrt(3), as we found earlier.\n\nAt the point of tangency C, the slope of the envelope must equal the slope of AB, so:\n\n- sqrt(1 - p^2)/p = -sqrt(3).\n\nSimplify:\n\nsqrt(1 - p^2)/p = sqrt(3).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(1 - p^2)/p\u00b2 = 3.\n\nMultiply both sides by p\u00b2:\n\n1 - p^2 = 3p\u00b2.\n\nSo, 1 = 4p\u00b2 => p\u00b2 = 1/4 => p = 1/2 (since p is between 0 and1).\n\nSo, p = 1/2.\n\nNow, let's find the point on the envelope at p=1/2.\n\nx = p^3 = (1/2)^3 = 1/8.\n\ny = (1 - p^2)^(3/2) = (1 - 1/4)^(3/2) = (3/4)^(3/2) = (sqrt(3/4))^3 = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nSo, the envelope and AB are tangent at point (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nNow, check if this point is on AB.\n\nAB is parametrized as x = (1/2)(1 - s), y = (sqrt(3)/2)s.\n\nSet x =1/8:\n\n(1/2)(1 - s) = 1/8 => 1 - s = 1/4 => s = 3/4.\n\nThen, y = (sqrt(3)/2)(3/4) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nWhich matches the y-coordinate. So, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nSo, OC is the distance from O(0,0) to C(1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nCompute OC\u00b2:\n\n(1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 1/64 + (27)/64 = (1 + 27)/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 3 sqrt(3) squared is 9*3=27, yes. So, 1 + 27 =28, 28/64=7/16.\n\nSo, OC\u00b2=7/16.\n\nSo, p=7, q=16, p+q=23.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because I might have made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let's compute OC\u00b2 again:\n\nx =1/8, so x\u00b2=1/64.\n\ny=3 sqrt(3)/8, so y\u00b2= (9*3)/64=27/64.\n\nSum: 1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 7 + 16=23.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we first identify the family of segments $\\overline{PQ}$, each of unit length with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. The equation of each segment is given by $\\frac{x}{p} + \\frac{y}{q} = 1$ where $p^2 + q^2 = 1$. \n\nNext, we find the envelope of this family, which is a curve tangent to each segment. Using the method for finding envelopes, we derive the parametric equations of the envelope as $x = p^3$ and $y = (1 - p^2)^{3/2}$. Converting this to Cartesian form, we get $y^2 = (1 - x^{2/3})^3$.\n\nWe then consider the line segment $\\overline{AB}$, which has the equation $y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

So, AB is indeed a segment of F. \n\nSo, AB is one such segment in F. The point C is on AB, but not on any other segment from F. So, for all other segments PQ in F, C is not on PQ. \n\nWe need to find the point C on AB such that OC\u00b2 is p/q, with p and q coprime, and then find p+q.\n\nSo, first, let's parametrize AB. Let's find the equation of AB. \n\nPoints A(1/2,0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). \n\nSo, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Plugging in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So, equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. \n\nSo, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x is between 0 and 1/2. \n\nOur point C is on AB, so we can write C as (x, sqrt(3)(1/2 - x)). \n\nNow, we need to find such a point C that doesn't lie on any other segment PQ in F except AB. \n\nSo, for any other segment PQ in F, C should not be on PQ. \n\nSo, perhaps we can find the condition where C is not on any other PQ, meaning that for C, the equation of PQ (if any) would require C to lie on it, but we can find such a point C where this is impossible except for AB itself. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think about the envelope of all such segments PQ in F.

But in this case, F is a family of line segments, not curves, but perhaps the envelope is a curve that each PQ is tangent to.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the family F and find the envelope.\n\nLet me think. Each PQ is a segment from (p,0) to (0,q), with p^2 + q^2 =1. So, each PQ is a line segment in the first quadrant. The equation of PQ can be written in intercept form: x/p + y/q = 1.\n\nSince p^2 + q^2 =1, we can write q = sqrt(1 - p^2). But p can vary from 0 to 1, so q varies from 1 to 0.\n\nSo, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) =1.\n\nNow, the family of lines is given by x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1, where p is a parameter between 0 and1.\n\nTo find the envelope of this family, we can use the standard method: take F(p,x,y) = x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) -1 =0.\n\nThe envelope satisfies F(p,x,y)=0 and dF/dp=0.\n\nCompute dF/dp: dF/dp = -x/p\u00b2 + (y * (p/(sqrt(1 - p^2)))) / (1 - p^2) - 0.\n\nWait, let me compute it correctly.\n\nF(p) = x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p^2) -1.\n\nSo, dF/dp = -x/p\u00b2 + (y * ( (1/2)(1 - p^2)^(-1/2) * 2p )) / (1 - p^2).\n\nWait, no.

Hmm.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nIf I cube both sides: y^4 = (1 - x^(2/3))^3.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different form.\n\nBut regardless, the envelope is this curve.\n\nNow, the point C is on AB and on the envelope, but since C is not on any other PQ except AB, perhaps AB is tangent to the envelope at point C.\n\nSo, AB is a line, and the envelope is a curve. If they are tangent, then C is the point of tangency.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find the point where AB is tangent to the envelope.\n\nSo, let's find the intersection of AB and the envelope, and impose that they are tangent, meaning the system has a double root.\n\nSo, AB has equation y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nThe envelope has equation y\u00b2 = (1 - x^(2/3))^3.\n\nSubstitute y from AB into the envelope equation.\n\nSo, [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^2 = (1 - x^(2/3))^3.\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\n[ sqrt(3)( -x + 1/2 ) ]^2 = 3( -x + 1/2 )^2 = 3(x^2 - x + 1/4).\n\nRight side: (1 - x^(2/3))^3.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n3x\u00b2 - 3x + 3/4 = (1 - x^(2/3))^3.\n\nLet me denote t = x^(1/3). Then, x = t^3, and x^(2/3) = t^2.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nLeft side: 3(t^3)^2 - 3(t^3) + 3/4 = 3t^6 - 3t^3 + 3/4.\n\nRight side: (1 - t^2)^3 = 1 - 3t^2 + 3t^4 - t^6.\n\nSo, equation: 3t^6 - 3t^3 + 3/4 = 1 - 3t^2 + 3t^4 - t^6.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n3t^6 -3t^3 +3/4 -1 +3t^2 -3t^4 +t^6=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(3t^6 + t^6) + (-3t^4) + (3t^2) + (-3t^3) + (3/4 -1) =0.\n\nSo:\n\n4t^6 -3t^4 +3t^2 -3t^3 -1/4=0.\n\nHmm, this is a 6th-degree polynomial in t, which seems complicated. Maybe I made a substitution mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Since the point C is on both AB and the envelope, and it's the point of tangency, the system should have a double root. So, perhaps we can set up the equation and find the discriminant to be zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to parametrize AB and find where it intersects the envelope, then impose that it's a tangent point.\n\nWait, let's parametrize AB. Let me write AB as parametric equations.\n\nAB goes from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's let parameter s go from 0 to1, with s=0 at A and s=1 at B.\n\nSo, parametric equations:\n\nx = (1/2)(1 - s).\n\ny = (sqrt(3)/2)s.\n\nSo, any point on AB is ( (1/2)(1 - s), (sqrt(3)/2)s ), where s \u2208 [0,1].\n\nNow, we want this point to lie on the envelope, which has equation y\u00b2 = (1 - x^(2/3))^3.\n\nSubstituting x and y:\n\n[ (sqrt(3)/2 s ) ]^2 = (1 - [ (1/2)(1 - s) ]^(2/3) )^3.\n\nCompute left side: (3/4)s\u00b2.\n\nRight side: [1 - ( (1/2)(1 - s) )^(2/3) ]^3.\n\nLet me write this equation:\n\n(3/4)s\u00b2 = [1 - ( (1/2)(1 - s) )^(2/3) ]^3.\n\nLet me denote u = (1/2)(1 - s). Then, 1 - s = 2u, so s = 1 - 2u.\n\nSo, substituting u:\n\nLeft side: (3/4)(1 - 2u)^2.\n\nRight side: [1 - u^(2/3) ]^3.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(3/4)(1 - 4u +4u\u00b2) = [1 - u^(2/3)]^3.\n\nHmm, but this might not help much. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to let t = s, and write the equation as:\n\n(3/4) t\u00b2 = [1 - ( (1/2)(1 - t) )^(2/3) ]^3.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can find a value of t that satisfies this equation, and also the derivative of AB equals the derivative of the envelope at that point, ensuring tangency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can take derivatives.\n\nWait, let's compute the derivative of the envelope at the point (x,y). We have the parametric equations x = p^3, y = (1 - p^2)^(3/2). So, dy/dx is (dy/dp)/(dx/dp).\n\nCompute dy/dp: d/dp [ (1 - p^2)^(3/2) ) ] = (3/2)(1 - p^2)^(1/2)(-2p) ) = -3p (1 - p^2)^(1/2).\n\ndx/dp: d/dp [p^3] = 3p^2.\n\nSo, dy/dx = [ -3p (1 - p^2)^(1/2) ] / [3p^2 ] = - (1 - p^2)^(1/2) / p.\n\nSo, the slope of the envelope at any point p is -sqrt(1 - p^2)/p.\n\nNow, the line AB has slope -sqrt(3), as we found earlier.\n\nAt the point of tangency C, the slope of the envelope must equal the slope of AB, so:\n\n- sqrt(1 - p^2)/p = -sqrt(3).\n\nSimplify:\n\nsqrt(1 - p^2)/p = sqrt(3).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(1 - p^2)/p\u00b2 = 3.\n\nMultiply both sides by p\u00b2:\n\n1 - p^2 = 3p\u00b2.\n\nSo, 1 = 4p\u00b2 => p\u00b2 = 1/4 => p = 1/2 (since p is between 0 and1).\n\nSo, p = 1/2.\n\nNow, let's find the point on the envelope at p=1/2.\n\nx = p^3 = (1/2)^3 = 1/8.\n\ny = (1 - p^2)^(3/2) = (1 - 1/4)^(3/2) = (3/4)^(3/2) = (sqrt(3/4))^3 = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nSo, the envelope and AB are tangent at point (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nNow, check if this point is on AB.\n\nAB is parametrized as x = (1/2)(1 - s), y = (sqrt(3)/2)s.\n\nSet x =1/8:\n\n(1/2)(1 - s) = 1/8 => 1 - s = 1/4 => s = 3/4.\n\nThen, y = (sqrt(3)/2)(3/4) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nWhich matches the y-coordinate. So, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nSo, OC is the distance from O(0,0) to C(1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nCompute OC\u00b2:\n\n(1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 1/64 + (27)/64 = (1 + 27)/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 3 sqrt(3) squared is 9*3=27, yes. So, 1 + 27 =28, 28/64=7/16.\n\nSo, OC\u00b2=7/16.\n\nSo, p=7, q=16, p+q=23.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because I might have made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let's compute OC\u00b2 again:\n\nx =1/8, so x\u00b2=1/64.\n\ny=3 sqrt(3)/8, so y\u00b2= (9*3)/64=27/64.\n\nSum: 1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 7 + 16=23.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first identify the family of segments $\\overline{PQ}$, each of unit length with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. The equation of each segment is given by $\\frac{x}{p} + \\frac{y}{q} = 1$ where $p^2 + q^2 = 1$. \n\nNext, we find the envelope of this family, which is a curve tangent to each segment. Using the method for finding envelopes, we derive the parametric equations of the envelope as $x = p^3$ and $y = (1 - p^2)^{3/2}$. Converting this to Cartesian form, we get $y^2 = (1 - x^{2/3})^3$.\n\nWe then consider the line segment $\\overline{AB}$, which has the equation $y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. To find the point $C$ where $\\overline{AB}$ is tangent to the envelope, we set the slopes equal. Solving, we find $p = \\frac{1}{2}$, leading to the point $C\\left(\\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\right)$.\n\nFinally, we calculate $OC^2$ as $\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\right)^2 = \\frac{7}{16}$. Thus, $p = 7$ and $q = 16$, giving $p + q = 23$.\n\n$\\boxed{23}$",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. It's about coordinate geometry, and there are some points and families of segments involved. Hmm, let me parse the problem step by step.\n\nWe have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis from O to (1,0), and B is somewhere on the y-axis. Let me sketch this mentally: O is the origin, A is (0.5, 0), and B is (0, approximately 0.866). So, the segment AB connects these two points.\n\nNow, there's a family F of segments PQ of unit length. Each PQ is a segment in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, for each such PQ, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), with p and q positive, and the length of PQ is 1. So, the distance between (p, 0) and (0, q) is 1. Using the distance formula, sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, so p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, all these PQ segments lie in the first quadrant, connecting the x-axis and y-axis, with unit length. So, the family F consists of all such possible segments. So, each PQ can be represented by the point (p, q) on the unit circle in the first quadrant, but connected as a segment from (p,0) to (0,q).\n\nNow, the problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. So, AB is a member of F? Wait, let's check. AB is the segment from A(1/2,0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me compute the length of AB. The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment of unit length, lying in the first quadrant, with P=A on the x-axis and Q=B on the y-axis. So, AB is part of the family F.\n\nSo, the problem says that there's a point C on AB such that C is only on AB and no other segment from F. So, all other segments in F don't pass through C except AB.\n\nWe need to find OC\u00b2, where O is the origin, and express it as p/q with p and q coprime, then find p + q.\n\nAlright, so how to approach this? I think we need to find the point C on AB such that it's not on any other segment PQ in F except AB. So, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of all segments in F? Because the envelope would be the boundary that just touches each segment in F, so the point C would be the point where AB is tangent to this envelope. Then, C would lie only on AB and not on any other PQ in F.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the point where AB is the only segment in F that passes through C, meaning that for all other PQ in F, C is not on PQ.\n\nI think the envelope idea is the way to go. The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. In this case, the family F consists of line segments, each of unit length from the x-axis to the y-axis. The envelope would form some kind of curve, and the point C would lie on this envelope and also on AB, such that AB is tangent to the envelope at C.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find the envelope of the family F, find its equation, then find the point of tangency with AB, which is C.\n\nLet me try to parametrize the family F. Each segment PQ can be described by p and q, where p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, for each (p, q) on the unit circle in the first quadrant, we have a segment from (p,0) to (0,q).\n\nAlternatively, we can parametrize the line PQ. Let me find the equation of the line PQ for a given p and q.\n\nThe line PQ goes from (p, 0) to (0, q). Its equation can be written in intercept form: x/p + y/q = 1.\n\nAlternatively, rearranged: qx + py = pq.\n\nSince p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, we can write this as qx + py = pq, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, the family of lines is given by qx + py = pq, where p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe can think of this as a one-parameter family, perhaps parameterizing by an angle or something else. Let me consider using a parameter theta, such that p = cos(theta), q = sin(theta), since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. So, for theta in [0, pi/2], p and q are positive.\n\nSo, substituting, the equation becomes q x + p y = p q, which is sin(theta) x + cos(theta) y = cos(theta) sin(theta).\n\nDivide both sides by cos(theta) sin(theta) (assuming neither cos(theta) nor sin(theta) is zero, which they aren't in (0, pi/2)):\n\n[sin(theta)/cos(theta)] x + [cos(theta)/sin(theta)] y = 1.\n\nSo, tan(theta) x + cot(theta) y = 1.\n\nSo, the equation is tan(theta) x + cot(theta) y = 1.\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as:\n\ntan(theta) x + (1/tan(theta)) y = 1.\n\nLet me denote t = tan(theta), so the equation becomes t x + (1/t) y = 1.\n\nSo, for t > 0, we can parametrize the family of lines as t x + (y)/t = 1.\n\nSo, the family is F(t): t x + y/t = 1, where t > 0.\n\nNow, to find the envelope of this family, we can use the method of finding the envelope of a family of curves. The envelope satisfies both the equation of the curve and the derivative with respect to the parameter set to zero.\n\nSo, for F(t): F(t, x, y) = t x + y/t - 1 = 0.\n\nThe envelope must satisfy F(t, x, y) = 0 and dF/dt = 0.\n\nCompute dF/dt:\n\ndF/dt = x - y/t\u00b2.\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\nx - y/t\u00b2 = 0 --> x = y/t\u00b2.\n\nNow, from F(t, x, y) = 0: t x + y/t = 1.\n\nSubstitute x = y/t\u00b2 into this equation:\n\nt*(y/t\u00b2) + y/t = 1 --> (y/t) + (y/t) = 1 --> (2y)/t = 1 --> y = t/2.\n\nNow, substitute back into x = y/t\u00b2:\n\nx = (t/2)/t\u00b2 = 1/(2t).\n\nSo, we have x = 1/(2t) and y = t/2.\n\nSo, to eliminate t, let me express t in terms of y: t = 2y.\n\nThen, x = 1/(2*(2y)) = 1/(4y).\n\nSo, x = 1/(4y).\n\nThus, the envelope is the curve x = 1/(4y), or equivalently, 4xy = 1.\n\nWait, that's a hyperbola. So, the envelope of the family F is the hyperbola 4xy = 1.\n\nSo, any point on this hyperbola is on exactly one segment from F, and each segment is tangent to the hyperbola at one point.\n\nWait, but the hyperbola 4xy=1 is in the first quadrant as well, so it's the same region as our segments.\n\nSo, the envelope is the hyperbola 4xy=1.\n\nSo, the point C lies on AB and on this envelope, and it's the point where AB is tangent to this hyperbola.\n\nWait, no. Because AB is a member of F, so AB is tangent to the envelope at point C. Because each member of F is tangent to the envelope at one point.\n\nSo, the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the hyperbola 4xy=1.\n\nSo, we need to find the point C on AB where AB is tangent to 4xy=1.\n\nAlternatively, since AB is the line from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), let me find its equation.\n\nFirst, find the slope of AB. The slope m is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2).\n\nSo, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nNow, we need to find the point C on AB that lies on the envelope 4xy=1, and such that AB is tangent to the hyperbola at C.\n\nWait, but AB is a member of F, so it's already tangent to the envelope. So, the point C is the point of tangency.\n\nSo, to find C, we can solve for the intersection of AB and the envelope, and since AB is tangent, there will be exactly one point of intersection.\n\nWait, but AB is a line, and the envelope is a hyperbola. So, solving their equations should give exactly one solution, which is the point C.\n\nSo, let me solve the system:\n\ny = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nand 4xy = 1.\n\nSubstitute y from the first equation into the second:\n\n4x*(-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2) = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n4x*(-sqrt(3) x) + 4x*(sqrt(3)/2) = 1.\n\nWhich is:\n\n-4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3) x = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by 1 to make it clearer:\n\n-4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3) x - 1 = 0.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in x. Let me write it as:\n\n4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 - 2 sqrt(3) x + 1 = 0.\n\nWait, I multiplied both sides by -1, so the signs flip. So:\n\n4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 - 2 sqrt(3) x + 1 = 0.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the substitution:\n\n4x*(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) = 1.\n\nSo, 4x*(-sqrt(3)x) = -4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2,\n\nand 4x*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2 sqrt(3) x.\n\nSo, -4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3) x = 1.\n\nSo, moving all terms to one side:\n\n-4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3) x - 1 = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 - 2 sqrt(3) x + 1 = 0.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's solve for x using the quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic equation is:\n\na x\u00b2 + b x + c = 0,\n\nwhere a = 4 sqrt(3),\n\nb = -2 sqrt(3),\n\nc = 1.\n\nSo, discriminant D = b\u00b2 - 4ac.\n\nCompute D:\n\n(-2 sqrt(3))\u00b2 - 4*(4 sqrt(3))*1 = (4*3) - 4*(4 sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, hold on, let me compute each term.\n\nb\u00b2 = (-2 sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 4 * 3 = 12.\n\n4ac = 4*(4 sqrt(3))*1 = 16 sqrt(3).\n\nSo, D = 12 - 16 sqrt(3).\n\nWait, that's a negative number because 16 sqrt(3) is about 27.7, so 12 - 27.7 is negative.\n\nBut that can't be, because AB is supposed to be tangent to the hyperbola, so the quadratic should have exactly one solution, meaning discriminant zero. Hmm, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nLet me go back. So, the envelope is 4xy = 1. The line AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting into 4xy=1:\n\n4x*(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) =1.\n\nWhich is 4x*(-sqrt(3)x) + 4x*(sqrt(3)/2) = -4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3) x =1.\n\nSo, -4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3) x -1 =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1: 4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 - 2 sqrt(3) x +1=0.\n\nWait, but if I compute the discriminant:\n\nD = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-2 sqrt(3))\u00b2 -4*(4 sqrt(3))*1 = 12 -16 sqrt(3).\n\nWhich is indeed negative. Hmm, that suggests that the line AB does not intersect the envelope, which can't be correct because AB is a member of the family F, so it should be tangent to the envelope.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in finding the envelope.\n\nLet me double-check the envelope computation.\n\nEarlier, I had F(t) = t x + y/t -1 =0.\n\nThen, dF/dt = x - y/t\u00b2 =0.\n\nSo, x = y/t\u00b2.\n\nSubstituting into F(t):\n\nt x + y/t =1 --> t*(y/t\u00b2) + y/t = y/t + y/t = 2y/t =1.\n\nSo, 2y/t=1 --> y= t/2.\n\nThen, x= y/t\u00b2 = (t/2)/t\u00b2 = 1/(2t).\n\nSo, x=1/(2t), y=t/2.\n\nThus, eliminating t: t = 2y, so x=1/(2*(2y)) = 1/(4y).\n\nSo, 4xy=1.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but if AB is a member of F, then it must be tangent to the envelope. So, perhaps AB is tangent to the envelope at C, but when we solved the system, the discriminant was negative, meaning no intersection? That can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the sign when moving terms. Let me re-express the equation:\n\nFrom substitution:\n\n-4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3) x -1 =0.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 -2 sqrt(3) x +1=0.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should have kept it as -4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3) x -1=0.\n\nLet me check the discriminant again.\n\na = -4 sqrt(3), b = 2 sqrt(3), c = -1.\n\nSo, D = (2 sqrt(3))\u00b2 -4*(-4 sqrt(3))*(-1).\n\nCompute:\n\n(2 sqrt(3))\u00b2 =4*3=12.\n\n4*a*c = 4*(-4 sqrt(3))*(-1)= 4*4 sqrt(3) =16 sqrt(3).\n\nSo, D=12 -16 sqrt(3).\n\nWhich is still negative. Hmm, that suggests that the line AB does not intersect the envelope, which contradicts the initial assumption that AB is a member of F and should be tangent.\n\nWait, perhaps the envelope is not 4xy=1 but something else? Did I make a mistake in computing the envelope?\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nWe had F(t, x, y) = t x + y/t -1 =0.\n\nThen, dF/dt = x - y/t\u00b2=0.\n\nSo, from dF/dt=0: x = y/t\u00b2.\n\nSubstitute into F(t, x, y):\n\nt*(y/t\u00b2) + y/t -1 = (y/t) + (y/t) -1 = 2y/t -1=0.\n\nSo, 2y/t=1 --> y= t/2.\n\nThen, x= y/t\u00b2 = (t/2)/t\u00b2=1/(2t).\n\nSo, x=1/(2t), y= t/2.\n\nSo, the envelope is the set of points (x,y) where x=1/(2t), y= t/2.\n\nSo, t can be expressed as t=2y.\n\nThus, x=1/(2*(2y))=1/(4y).\n\nSo, 4xy=1.\n\nSo, that's correct. So, the envelope is 4xy=1.\n\nWait, but then the line AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nLet me check if this line is tangent to the hyperbola 4xy=1.\n\nFor a line to be tangent to a hyperbola, the system should have exactly one solution.\n\nBut when we substitute, we get a quadratic equation with a negative discriminant, which suggests no real solutions. That can't be.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization.\n\nWait, perhaps the parametrization is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The family F(t) is t x + y/t =1, t>0.\n\nBut is that correct? Let me think about what t represents. Earlier, we set t = tan(theta), where theta was the angle parameterizing p and q on the unit circle.\n\nWait, let me check for a specific case. Let's take t=1. Then, the equation is x + y =1. That is a line from (1,0) to (0,1), which is a unit-length segment, correct.\n\nSimilarly, if t approaches 0, the line becomes y/t =1, which as t approaches 0, the line becomes nearly vertical, but for t>0, it's okay.\n\nWait, but in our case, AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, p=1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2. So, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = (1/4) + (3/4) =1, which is correct.\n\nSo, for AB, p=1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, t = tan(theta) where theta is the angle such that cos(theta)=p=1/2, sin(theta)=q= sqrt(3)/2. So, theta=60 degrees, pi/3 radians.\n\nSo, t= tan(pi/3)= sqrt(3).\n\nSo, t= sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the equation of AB is t x + y/t =1, which is sqrt(3) x + y/(sqrt(3)) =1.\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n3x + y = sqrt(3).\n\nBut wait, earlier, we had the equation of AB as y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nFrom points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2), the slope m=(sqrt(3)/2 -0)/(0 -1/2)= (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2)= -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, equation: y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2)= -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nBut according to the parametrization, the equation is 3x + y = sqrt(3).\n\nLet me check if these are the same.\n\nFrom the parametrization: 3x + y = sqrt(3).\n\nFrom the slope: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nLet me rearrange the slope equation:\n\ny + sqrt(3)x = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n2y + 2 sqrt(3)x = sqrt(3).\n\nWhich is different from 3x + y = sqrt(3).\n\nWait, that suggests a discrepancy. So, perhaps my parametrization is wrong.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the parametrization, t x + y/t =1, with t= sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(3) x + y/(sqrt(3)) =1.\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n3x + y = sqrt(3).\n\nBut according to the equation of AB, it's y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, let's see if these are the same.\n\nFrom the parametrization, 3x + y = sqrt(3) --> y = -3x + sqrt(3).\n\nBut the equation from the points is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nThese are different lines.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, perhaps my parametrization is wrong.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nEarlier, I parametrized F(t) as t x + y/t =1, where t = tan(theta), with theta such that cos(theta)=p, sin(theta)=q.\n\nBut in reality, p and q are the intercepts, so p = cos(theta), q = sin(theta).\n\nSo, the line equation is x/p + y/q =1.\n\nSo, substituting p= cos(theta), q=sin(theta):\n\nx/cos(theta) + y/sin(theta) =1.\n\nMultiply both sides by sin(theta) cos(theta):\n\nx sin(theta) + y cos(theta) = sin(theta) cos(theta).\n\nSo, that's another way to write the line equation.\n\nAlternatively, to write it as a function of theta.\n\nHmm, perhaps using theta as a parameter is better.\n\nLet me define F(theta): x sin(theta) + y cos(theta) = sin(theta) cos(theta).\n\nSo, the family is F(theta, x, y) = x sin(theta) + y cos(theta) - sin(theta) cos(theta) =0.\n\nThen, to find the envelope, compute dF/d(theta) =0.\n\nCompute dF/d(theta):\n\nx cos(theta) - y sin(theta) - [cos\u00b2(theta) - sin\u00b2(theta)] =0.\n\nSo,\n\nx cos(theta) - y sin(theta) - cos(2 theta) =0.\n\nWait, because cos\u00b2(theta) - sin\u00b2(theta) = cos(2 theta).\n\nSo, the envelope condition is:\n\nx cos(theta) - y sin(theta) - cos(2 theta) =0.\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1. x sin(theta) + y cos(theta) = sin(theta) cos(theta).\n\n2. x cos(theta) - y sin(theta) = cos(2 theta).\n\nLet me write them as:\n\nEquation (1): x sin(theta) + y cos(theta) = (1/2) sin(2 theta).\n\nEquation (2): x cos(theta) - y sin(theta) = cos(2 theta).\n\nLet me try to solve these two equations for x and y.\n\nLet me treat these as a system of linear equations in x and y.\n\nEquation (1): sin(theta) x + cos(theta) y = (1/2) sin(2 theta).\n\nEquation (2): cos(theta) x - sin(theta) y = cos(2 theta).\n\nLet me write this in matrix form:\n\n[ sin(theta)   cos(theta) ] [x]   = [ (1/2) sin(2 theta) ]\n[ cos(theta)  -sin(theta) ] [y]     [ cos(2 theta)        ]\n\nLet me denote the coefficient matrix as M:\n\nM = [ sin(theta)   cos(theta) ]\n        [ cos(theta)  -sin(theta) ]\n\nThe determinant of M is:\n\ndet(M) = sin(theta)*(-sin(theta)) - cos(theta)*cos(theta) = -sin\u00b2(theta) - cos\u00b2(theta) = - (sin\u00b2(theta) + cos\u00b2(theta)) = -1.\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the system has a unique solution.\n\nWe can solve for x and y using Cramer's rule.\n\nCompute x:\n\nx = [ | (1/2 sin(2 theta))   cos(theta) |\n        | cos(2 theta)        -sin(theta) | ] / det(M)\n\nSimilarly for y.\n\nBut since det(M) = -1, the denominator is -1.\n\nCompute the numerator for x:\n\n(1/2 sin(2 theta))*(-sin(theta)) - cos(theta)*cos(2 theta).\n\n= (-1/2 sin(2 theta) sin(theta)) - cos(theta) cos(2 theta).\n\nSimilarly, for y:\n\n[ sin(theta)   (1/2 sin(2 theta)) ]\n[ cos(theta)    cos(2 theta)      ]\n\nDeterminant:\n\nsin(theta)*cos(2 theta) - (1/2 sin(2 theta)) cos(theta).\n\n= sin(theta) cos(2 theta) - (1/2)(2 sin(theta) cos(theta)) cos(theta).\n\n= sin(theta) cos(2 theta) - sin(theta) cos\u00b2(theta).\n\n= sin(theta) [ cos(2 theta) - cos\u00b2(theta) ].\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to solve the system using substitution or elimination.\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\ncos(theta) x - sin(theta) y = cos(2 theta).\n\nLet me solve for x:\n\ncos(theta) x = sin(theta) y + cos(2 theta).\n\nSo,\n\nx = [ sin(theta) y + cos(2 theta) ] / cos(theta).\n\nSubstitute this into equation (1):\n\nsin(theta) * [ (sin(theta) y + cos(2 theta))/cos(theta) ] + cos(theta) y = (1/2) sin(2 theta).\n\nMultiply through:\n\n[ sin\u00b2(theta) y + sin(theta) cos(2 theta) ] / cos(theta) + cos(theta) y = (1/2) sin(2 theta).\n\nMultiply all terms by cos(theta) to eliminate the denominator:\n\nsin\u00b2(theta) y + sin(theta) cos(2 theta) + cos\u00b2(theta) y = (1/2) sin(2 theta) cos(theta).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n[ sin\u00b2(theta) + cos\u00b2(theta) ] y + sin(theta) cos(2 theta) = (1/2) sin(2 theta) cos(theta).\n\nSince sin\u00b2(theta) + cos\u00b2(theta) =1,\n\ny + sin(theta) cos(2 theta) = (1/2) sin(2 theta) cos(theta).\n\nSo,\n\ny = (1/2) sin(2 theta) cos(theta) - sin(theta) cos(2 theta).\n\nSimplify the right-hand side.\n\nNote that sin(2 theta) = 2 sin(theta) cos(theta).\n\nSo,\n\n(1/2) sin(2 theta) cos(theta) = (1/2)(2 sin(theta) cos(theta)) cos(theta) = sin(theta) cos\u00b2(theta).\n\nAnd,\n\nsin(theta) cos(2 theta) = sin(theta) (2 cos\u00b2(theta) -1).\n\nSo,\n\ny = sin(theta) cos\u00b2(theta) - sin(theta) (2 cos\u00b2(theta) -1).\n\n= sin(theta) cos\u00b2(theta) - 2 sin(theta) cos\u00b2(theta) + sin(theta).\n\n= (- sin(theta) cos\u00b2(theta)) + sin(theta).\n\n= sin(theta) (1 - cos\u00b2(theta)).\n\n= sin(theta) sin\u00b2(theta).\n\n= sin\u00b3(theta).\n\nSo, y = sin\u00b3(theta).\n\nSimilarly, from earlier,\n\nx = [ sin(theta) y + cos(2 theta) ] / cos(theta).\n\nSubstitute y= sin\u00b3(theta):\n\nx = [ sin(theta) * sin\u00b3(theta) + cos(2 theta) ] / cos(theta).\n\n= [ sin^4(theta) + cos(2 theta) ] / cos(theta).\n\nHmm, let's try to simplify this.\n\nExpress cos(2 theta) as 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(theta).\n\nSo,\n\nx = [ sin^4(theta) + 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(theta) ] / cos(theta).\n\nFactor numerator:\n\nsin^4(theta) - 2 sin\u00b2(theta) +1 = (sin\u00b2(theta) -1)^2 = ( -cos\u00b2(theta) )^2 = cos^4(theta).\n\nSo,\n\nx = [ cos^4(theta) ] / cos(theta) = cos^3(theta).\n\nSo, x= cos^3(theta), y= sin^3(theta).\n\nThus, the envelope is parametrized by theta as x= cos^3(theta), y= sin^3(theta).\n\nSo, in Cartesian coordinates, we can write:\n\nx = cos^3(theta),\n\ny = sin^3(theta).\n\nSo, to eliminate theta, we can write:\n\nsqrt(x) = cos^(3/2)(theta),\n\nsqrt(y) = sin^(3/2)(theta).\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider the relation between x and y.\n\nWe have:\n\nx = cos^3(theta),\n\ny = sin^3(theta).\n\nSo, (x)^(2/3) = cos\u00b2(theta),\n\n(y)^(2/3) = sin\u00b2(theta).\n\nAdding them:\n\n(x)^(2/3) + (y)^(2/3) = cos\u00b2(theta) + sin\u00b2(theta) =1.\n\nSo, the envelope is the astroid (x)^(2/3) + (y)^(2/3) =1.\n\nAh, okay, so the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nThat makes more sense. So, the envelope is not the hyperbola I thought earlier, but an astroid.\n\nSo, I must have made a mistake in the earlier parametrization.\n\nTherefore, the correct envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nSo, the astroid is the envelope of the family F.\n\nSo, point C lies on AB and on this astroid, and AB is tangent to the astroid at C.\n\nSo, to find C, we need to solve the system:\n\n1. y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\n2. x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nWe can substitute equation 1 into equation 2.\n\nLet me write equation 2 as:\n\n(x)^(2/3) + (y)^(2/3) =1.\n\nSubstitute y:\n\n(x)^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) =1.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can make a substitution.\n\nLet me denote t = x^(1/3). Then, x = t^3.\n\nSimilarly, y = -sqrt(3) t^3 + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substitute into equation 2:\n\n(t^3)^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3) t^3 + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\nt^2 + [ sqrt(3)( -t^3 + 1/2 ) ]^(2/3) =1.\n\nFactor sqrt(3):\n\n= t^2 + [ sqrt(3) (1/2 - t^3) ]^(2/3).\n\nLet me compute [ sqrt(3) (1/2 - t^3) ]^(2/3).\n\nFirst, sqrt(3) is 3^(1/2), so:\n\n[3^(1/2) (1/2 - t^3)]^(2/3) = [3^(1/2)]^(2/3) * (1/2 - t^3)^(2/3).\n\n= 3^(1/3) * (1/2 - t^3)^(2/3).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nt^2 + 3^(1/3) (1/2 - t^3)^(2/3) =1.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can make a substitution u = t^3.\n\nLet me set u = t^3.\n\nThen, t = u^(1/3).\n\nSo, t^2 = u^(2/3).\n\nAnd, 1/2 - t^3 = 1/2 - u.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nu^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) (1/2 - u)^(2/3) =1.\n\nHmm, this is still quite messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that point C is such that x and y are related in a way that makes substitution easier.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the astroid.\n\nThe astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1 can be parametrized as:\n\nx = cos^3(theta),\n\ny = sin^3(theta).\n\nSo, let's see if AB is tangent to the astroid at point C.\n\nThe point C lies on both AB and the astroid.\n\nSo, let me write the parametric equations of the astroid:\n\nx = cos^3(theta),\n\ny = sin^3(theta).\n\nWe can also write the equation of the tangent to the astroid at theta.\n\nThe derivative dy/dx for the astroid can be found by differentiating implicitly:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx =0.\n\nSo,\n\ndy/dx = - [ (x)^( -1/3 ) ] / [ (y)^( -1/3 ) ] = - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)).\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent at (x,y) on the astroid is - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)).\n\nBut the line AB has slope m = -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, at point C, the slope of the astroid is -sqrt(3).\n\nTherefore,\n\n- (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3).\n\nSimplify:\n\n(y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)) = sqrt(3).\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3:\n\ny / x = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3^(3/2) = 3*sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\ny = 3 sqrt(3) x.\n\nBut we also know that point C lies on AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting y =3 sqrt(3) x into the equation of AB:\n\n3 sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n3 sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4 sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n4x = 1/2.\n\nSo,\n\nx = (1/2)/4 = 1/8.\n\nThen, y=3 sqrt(3) * (1/8) = 3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nNow, let's verify that this point lies on the astroid.\n\nCompute x^(2/3) + y^(2/3):\n\nx^(2/3) = (1/8)^(2/3) = (2^(-3))^(2/3) = 2^(-2) = 1/4.\n\ny^(2/3) = (3 sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3).\n\nFirst, write 3 sqrt(3) as 3^(3/2).\n\nSo, y=3^(3/2)/8.\n\nSo, y^(2/3) = [3^(3/2)/8]^(2/3) = 3^( (3/2)*(2/3) ) / 8^(2/3) = 3^1 / (8^(2/3)).\n\n8^(2/3) = (2^3)^(2/3) = 2^(2) =4.\n\nSo, y^(2/3)= 3/4.\n\nSo, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1/4 + 3/4 =1. Correct.\n\nSo, point C is indeed on the astroid.\n\nSo, OC is the distance from the origin to point C, which is sqrt( (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 ).\n\nCompute OC\u00b2:\n\n(1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 1/64 + (9*3)/64 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.\n\nSo, OC\u00b2=7/16.\n\nThus, p=7, q=16, so p+q=23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{23}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. It's about coordinate geometry, and there are some points and families of segments involved. Hmm, let me parse the problem step by step.\n\nWe have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis from O to (1,0), and B is somewhere on the y-axis. Let me sketch this mentally: O is the origin, A is (0.5, 0), and B is (0, approximately 0.866). So, the segment AB connects these two points.\n\nNow, there's a family F of segments PQ of unit length. Each PQ is a segment in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, for each such PQ, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), with p and q positive, and the length of PQ is 1. So, the distance between (p, 0) and (0, q) is 1. Using the distance formula, sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, so p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, all these PQ segments lie in the first quadrant, connecting the x-axis and y-axis, with unit length. So, the family F consists of all such possible segments. So, each PQ can be represented by the point (p, q) on the unit circle in the first quadrant, but connected as a segment from (p,0) to (0,q).\n\nNow, the problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. So, AB is a member of F? Wait, let's check. AB is the segment from A(1/2,0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me compute the length of AB. The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment of unit length, lying in the first quadrant, with P=A on the x-axis and Q=B on the y-axis. So, AB is part of the family F.\n\nSo, the problem says that there's a point C on AB such that C is only on AB and no other segment from F. So, all other segments in F don't pass through C except AB.\n\nWe need to find OC\u00b2, where O is the origin, and express it as p/q with p and q coprime, then find p + q.\n\nAlright, so how to approach this? I think we need to find the point C on AB such that it's not on any other segment PQ in F except AB. So, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of all segments in F? Because the envelope would be the boundary that just touches each segment in F, so the point C would be the point where AB is tangent to this envelope. Then, C would lie only on AB and not on any other PQ in F.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the point where AB is the only segment in F that passes through C, meaning that for all other PQ in F, C is not on PQ.\n\nI think the envelope idea is the way to go. The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. In this case, the family F consists of line segments, each of unit length from the x-axis to the y-axis. The envelope would form some kind of curve, and the point C would lie on this envelope and also on AB, such that AB is tangent to the envelope at C.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find the envelope of the family F, find its equation, then find the point of tangency with AB, which is C.\n\nLet me try to parametrize the family F. Each segment PQ can be described by p and q, where p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, for each (p, q) on the unit circle in the first quadrant, we have a segment from (p,0) to (0,q).\n\nAlternatively, we can parametrize the line PQ. Let me find the equation of the line PQ for a given p and q.\n\nThe line PQ goes from (p, 0) to (0, q). Its equation can be written in intercept form: x/p + y/q = 1.\n\nAlternatively, rearranged: qx + py = pq.\n\nSince p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, we can write this as qx + py = pq, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, the family of lines is given by qx + py = pq, where p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe can think of this as a one-parameter family, perhaps parameterizing by an angle or something else. Let me consider using a parameter theta, such that p = cos(theta), q = sin(theta), since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. So, for theta in [0, pi/2], p and q are positive.\n\nSo, substituting, the equation becomes q x + p y = p q, which is sin(theta) x + cos(theta) y = cos(theta) sin(theta).\n\nDivide both sides by cos(theta) sin(theta) (assuming neither cos(theta) nor sin(theta) is zero, which they aren't in (0, pi/2)):\n\n[sin(theta)/cos(theta)] x + [cos(theta)/sin(theta)] y = 1.\n\nSo, tan(theta) x + cot(theta) y = 1.\n\nSo, the equation is tan(theta) x + cot(theta) y = 1.\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as:\n\ntan(theta) x + (1/tan(theta)) y = 1.\n\nLet me denote t = tan(theta), so the equation becomes t x + (1/t) y = 1.\n\nSo, for t > 0, we can parametrize the family of lines as t x + (y)/t = 1.\n\nSo, the family is F(t): t x + y/t = 1, where t > 0.\n\nNow, to find the envelope of this family, we can use the method of finding the envelope of a family of curves. The envelope satisfies both the equation of the curve and the derivative with respect to the parameter set to zero.\n\nSo, for F(t): F(t, x, y) = t x + y/t - 1 = 0.\n\nThe envelope must satisfy F(t, x, y) = 0 and dF/dt = 0.\n\nCompute dF/dt:\n\ndF/dt = x - y/t\u00b2.\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\nx - y/t\u00b2 = 0 --> x = y/t\u00b2.\n\nNow, from F(t, x, y) = 0: t x + y/t = 1.\n\nSubstitute x = y/t\u00b2 into this equation:\n\nt*(y/t\u00b2) + y/t = 1 --> (y/t) + (y/t) = 1 --> (2y)/t = 1 --> y = t/2.\n\nNow, substitute back into x = y/t\u00b2:\n\nx = (t/2)/t\u00b2 = 1/(2t).\n\nSo, we have x = 1/(2t) and y = t/2.\n\nSo, to eliminate t, let me express t in terms of y: t = 2y.\n\nThen, x = 1/(2*(2y)) = 1/(4y).\n\nSo, x = 1/(4y).\n\nThus, the envelope is the curve x = 1/(4y), or equivalently, 4xy = 1.\n\nWait, that's a hyperbola. So, the envelope of the family F is the hyperbola 4xy = 1.\n\nSo, any point on this hyperbola is on exactly one segment from F, and each segment is tangent to the hyperbola at one point.\n\nWait, but the hyperbola 4xy=1 is in the first quadrant as well, so it's the same region as our segments.\n\nSo, the envelope is the hyperbola 4xy=1.\n\nSo, the point C lies on AB and on this envelope, and it's the point where AB is tangent to this hyperbola.\n\nWait, no. Because AB is a member of F, so AB is tangent to the envelope at point C. Because each member of F is tangent to the envelope at one point.\n\nSo, the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the hyperbola 4xy=1.\n\nSo, we need to find the point C on AB where AB is tangent to 4xy=1.\n\nAlternatively, since AB is the line from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), let me find its equation.\n\nFirst, find the slope of AB. The slope m is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2).\n\nSo, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nNow, we need to find the point C on AB that lies on the envelope 4xy=1, and such that AB is tangent to the hyperbola at C.\n\nWait, but AB is a member of F, so it's already tangent to the envelope. So, the point C is the point of tangency.\n\nSo, to find C, we can solve for the intersection of AB and the envelope, and since AB is tangent, there will be exactly one point of intersection.\n\nWait, but AB is a line, and the envelope is a hyperbola. So, solving their equations should give exactly one solution, which is the point C.\n\nSo, let me solve the system:\n\ny = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nand 4xy = 1.\n\nSubstitute y from the first equation into the second:\n\n4x*(-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2) = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n4x*(-sqrt(3) x) + 4x*(sqrt(3)/2) = 1.\n\nWhich is:\n\n-4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3) x = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by 1 to make it clearer:\n\n-4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3) x - 1 = 0.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in x. Let me write it as:\n\n4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 - 2 sqrt(3) x + 1 = 0.\n\nWait, I multiplied both sides by -1, so the signs flip. So:\n\n4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 - 2 sqrt(3) x + 1 = 0.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the substitution:\n\n4x*(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) = 1.\n\nSo, 4x*(-sqrt(3)x) = -4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2,\n\nand 4x*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2 sqrt(3) x.\n\nSo, -4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3) x = 1.\n\nSo, moving all terms to one side:\n\n-4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3) x - 1 = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 - 2 sqrt(3) x + 1 = 0.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's solve for x using the quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic equation is:\n\na x\u00b2 + b x + c = 0,\n\nwhere a = 4 sqrt(3),\n\nb = -2 sqrt(3),\n\nc = 1.\n\nSo, discriminant D = b\u00b2 - 4ac.\n\nCompute D:\n\n(-2 sqrt(3))\u00b2 - 4*(4 sqrt(3))*1 = (4*3) - 4*(4 sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, hold on, let me compute each term.\n\nb\u00b2 = (-2 sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 4 * 3 = 12.\n\n4ac = 4*(4 sqrt(3))*1 = 16 sqrt(3).\n\nSo, D = 12 - 16 sqrt(3).\n\nWait, that's a negative number because 16 sqrt(3) is about 27.7, so 12 - 27.7 is negative.\n\nBut that can't be, because AB is supposed to be tangent to the hyperbola, so the quadratic should have exactly one solution, meaning discriminant zero. Hmm, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nLet me go back. So, the envelope is 4xy = 1. The line AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting into 4xy=1:\n\n4x*(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) =1.\n\nWhich is 4x*(-sqrt(3)x) + 4x*(sqrt(3)/2) = -4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3) x =1.\n\nSo, -4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3) x -1 =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1: 4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 - 2 sqrt(3) x +1=0.\n\nWait, but if I compute the discriminant:\n\nD = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-2 sqrt(3))\u00b2 -4*(4 sqrt(3))*1 = 12 -16 sqrt(3).\n\nWhich is indeed negative. Hmm, that suggests that the line AB does not intersect the envelope, which can't be correct because AB is a member of the family F, so it should be tangent to the envelope.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in finding the envelope.\n\nLet me double-check the envelope computation.\n\nEarlier, I had F(t) = t x + y/t -1 =0.\n\nThen, dF/dt = x - y/t\u00b2 =0.\n\nSo, x = y/t\u00b2.\n\nSubstituting into F(t):\n\nt x + y/t =1 --> t*(y/t\u00b2) + y/t = y/t + y/t = 2y/t =1.\n\nSo, 2y/t=1 --> y= t/2.\n\nThen, x= y/t\u00b2 = (t/2)/t\u00b2 = 1/(2t).\n\nSo, x=1/(2t), y=t/2.\n\nThus, eliminating t: t = 2y, so x=1/(2*(2y)) = 1/(4y).\n\nSo, 4xy=1.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but if AB is a member of F, then it must be tangent to the envelope. So, perhaps AB is tangent to the envelope at C, but when we solved the system, the discriminant was negative, meaning no intersection? That can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the sign when moving terms. Let me re-express the equation:\n\nFrom substitution:\n\n-4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3) x -1 =0.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 -2 sqrt(3) x +1=0.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should have kept it as -4 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3) x -1=0.\n\nLet me check the discriminant again.\n\na = -4 sqrt(3), b = 2 sqrt(3), c = -1.\n\nSo, D = (2 sqrt(3))\u00b2 -4*(-4 sqrt(3))*(-1).\n\nCompute:\n\n(2 sqrt(3))\u00b2 =4*3=12.\n\n4*a*c = 4*(-4 sqrt(3))*(-1)= 4*4 sqrt(3) =16 sqrt(3).\n\nSo, D=12 -16 sqrt(3).\n\nWhich is still negative. Hmm, that suggests that the line AB does not intersect the envelope, which contradicts the initial assumption that AB is a member of F and should be tangent.\n\nWait, perhaps the envelope is not 4xy=1 but something else? Did I make a mistake in computing the envelope?\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nWe had F(t, x, y) = t x + y/t -1 =0.\n\nThen, dF/dt = x - y/t\u00b2=0.\n\nSo, from dF/dt=0: x = y/t\u00b2.\n\nSubstitute into F(t, x, y):\n\nt*(y/t\u00b2) + y/t -1 = (y/t) + (y/t) -1 = 2y/t -1=0.\n\nSo, 2y/t=1 --> y= t/2.\n\nThen, x= y/t\u00b2 = (t/2)/t\u00b2=1/(2t).\n\nSo, x=1/(2t), y= t/2.\n\nSo, the envelope is the set of points (x,y) where x=1/(2t), y= t/2.\n\nSo, t can be expressed as t=2y.\n\nThus, x=1/(2*(2y))=1/(4y).\n\nSo, 4xy=1.\n\nSo, that's correct. So, the envelope is 4xy=1.\n\nWait, but then the line AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nLet me check if this line is tangent to the hyperbola 4xy=1.\n\nFor a line to be tangent to a hyperbola, the system should have exactly one solution.\n\nBut when we substitute, we get a quadratic equation with a negative discriminant, which suggests no real solutions. That can't be.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization.\n\nWait, perhaps the parametrization is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The family F(t) is t x + y/t =1, t>0.\n\nBut is that correct? Let me think about what t represents. Earlier, we set t = tan(theta), where theta was the angle parameterizing p and q on the unit circle.\n\nWait, let me check for a specific case. Let's take t=1. Then, the equation is x + y =1. That is a line from (1,0) to (0,1), which is a unit-length segment, correct.\n\nSimilarly, if t approaches 0, the line becomes y/t =1, which as t approaches 0, the line becomes nearly vertical, but for t>0, it's okay.\n\nWait, but in our case, AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, p=1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2. So, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = (1/4) + (3/4) =1, which is correct.\n\nSo, for AB, p=1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, t = tan(theta) where theta is the angle such that cos(theta)=p=1/2, sin(theta)=q= sqrt(3)/2. So, theta=60 degrees, pi/3 radians.\n\nSo, t= tan(pi/3)= sqrt(3).\n\nSo, t= sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the equation of AB is t x + y/t =1, which is sqrt(3) x + y/(sqrt(3)) =1.\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n3x + y = sqrt(3).\n\nBut wait, earlier, we had the equation of AB as y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nFrom points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2), the slope m=(sqrt(3)/2 -0)/(0 -1/2)= (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2)= -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, equation: y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2)= -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nBut according to the parametrization, the equation is 3x + y = sqrt(3).\n\nLet me check if these are the same.\n\nFrom the parametrization: 3x + y = sqrt(3).\n\nFrom the slope: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nLet me rearrange the slope equation:\n\ny + sqrt(3)x = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n2y + 2 sqrt(3)x = sqrt(3).\n\nWhich is different from 3x + y = sqrt(3).\n\nWait, that suggests a discrepancy. So, perhaps my parametrization is wrong.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the parametrization, t x + y/t =1, with t= sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(3) x + y/(sqrt(3)) =1.\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n3x + y = sqrt(3).\n\nBut according to the equation of AB, it's y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, let's see if these are the same.\n\nFrom the parametrization, 3x + y = sqrt(3) --> y = -3x + sqrt(3).\n\nBut the equation from the points is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nThese are different lines.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, perhaps my parametrization is wrong.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nEarlier, I parametrized F(t) as t x + y/t =1, where t = tan(theta), with theta such that cos(theta)=p, sin(theta)=q.\n\nBut in reality, p and q are the intercepts, so p = cos(theta), q = sin(theta).\n\nSo, the line equation is x/p + y/q =1.\n\nSo, substituting p= cos(theta), q=sin(theta):\n\nx/cos(theta) + y/sin(theta) =1.\n\nMultiply both sides by sin(theta) cos(theta):\n\nx sin(theta) + y cos(theta) = sin(theta) cos(theta).\n\nSo, that's another way to write the line equation.\n\nAlternatively, to write it as a function of theta.\n\nHmm, perhaps using theta as a parameter is better.\n\nLet me define F(theta): x sin(theta) + y cos(theta) = sin(theta) cos(theta).\n\nSo, the family is F(theta, x, y) = x sin(theta) + y cos(theta) - sin(theta) cos(theta) =0.\n\nThen, to find the envelope, compute dF/d(theta) =0.\n\nCompute dF/d(theta):\n\nx cos(theta) - y sin(theta) - [cos\u00b2(theta) - sin\u00b2(theta)] =0.\n\nSo,\n\nx cos(theta) - y sin(theta) - cos(2 theta) =0.\n\nWait, because cos\u00b2(theta) - sin\u00b2(theta) = cos(2 theta).\n\nSo, the envelope condition is:\n\nx cos(theta) - y sin(theta) - cos(2 theta) =0.\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1. x sin(theta) + y cos(theta) = sin(theta) cos(theta).\n\n2. x cos(theta) - y sin(theta) = cos(2 theta).\n\nLet me write them as:\n\nEquation (1): x sin(theta) + y cos(theta) = (1/2) sin(2 theta).\n\nEquation (2): x cos(theta) - y sin(theta) = cos(2 theta).\n\nLet me try to solve these two equations for x and y.\n\nLet me treat these as a system of linear equations in x and y.\n\nEquation (1): sin(theta) x + cos(theta) y = (1/2) sin(2 theta).\n\nEquation (2): cos(theta) x - sin(theta) y = cos(2 theta).\n\nLet me write this in matrix form:\n\n[ sin(theta)   cos(theta) ] [x]   = [ (1/2) sin(2 theta) ]\n[ cos(theta)  -sin(theta) ] [y]     [ cos(2 theta)        ]\n\nLet me denote the coefficient matrix as M:\n\nM = [ sin(theta)   cos(theta) ]\n        [ cos(theta)  -sin(theta) ]\n\nThe determinant of M is:\n\ndet(M) = sin(theta)*(-sin(theta)) - cos(theta)*cos(theta) = -sin\u00b2(theta) - cos\u00b2(theta) = - (sin\u00b2(theta) + cos\u00b2(theta)) = -1.\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the system has a unique solution.\n\nWe can solve for x and y using Cramer's rule.\n\nCompute x:\n\nx = [ | (1/2 sin(2 theta))   cos(theta) |\n        | cos(2 theta)        -sin(theta) | ] / det(M)\n\nSimilarly for y.\n\nBut since det(M) = -1, the denominator is -1.\n\nCompute the numerator for x:\n\n(1/2 sin(2 theta))*(-sin(theta)) - cos(theta)*cos(2 theta).\n\n= (-1/2 sin(2 theta) sin(theta)) - cos(theta) cos(2 theta).\n\nSimilarly, for y:\n\n[ sin(theta)   (1/2 sin(2 theta)) ]\n[ cos(theta)    cos(2 theta)      ]\n\nDeterminant:\n\nsin(theta)*cos(2 theta) - (1/2 sin(2 theta)) cos(theta).\n\n= sin(theta) cos(2 theta) - (1/2)(2 sin(theta) cos(theta)) cos(theta).\n\n= sin(theta) cos(2 theta) - sin(theta) cos\u00b2(theta).\n\n= sin(theta) [ cos(2 theta) - cos\u00b2(theta) ].\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to solve the system using substitution or elimination.\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\ncos(theta) x - sin(theta) y = cos(2 theta).\n\nLet me solve for x:\n\ncos(theta) x = sin(theta) y + cos(2 theta).\n\nSo,\n\nx = [ sin(theta) y + cos(2 theta) ] / cos(theta).\n\nSubstitute this into equation (1):\n\nsin(theta) * [ (sin(theta) y + cos(2 theta))/cos(theta) ] + cos(theta) y = (1/2) sin(2 theta).\n\nMultiply through:\n\n[ sin\u00b2(theta) y + sin(theta) cos(2 theta) ] / cos(theta) + cos(theta) y = (1/2) sin(2 theta).\n\nMultiply all terms by cos(theta) to eliminate the denominator:\n\nsin\u00b2(theta) y + sin(theta) cos(2 theta) + cos\u00b2(theta) y = (1/2) sin(2 theta) cos(theta).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n[ sin\u00b2(theta) + cos\u00b2(theta) ] y + sin(theta) cos(2 theta) = (1/2) sin(2 theta) cos(theta).\n\nSince sin\u00b2(theta) + cos\u00b2(theta) =1,\n\ny + sin(theta) cos(2 theta) = (1/2) sin(2 theta) cos(theta).\n\nSo,\n\ny = (1/2) sin(2 theta) cos(theta) - sin(theta) cos(2 theta).\n\nSimplify the right-hand side.\n\nNote that sin(2 theta) = 2 sin(theta) cos(theta).\n\nSo,\n\n(1/2) sin(2 theta) cos(theta) = (1/2)(2 sin(theta) cos(theta)) cos(theta) = sin(theta) cos\u00b2(theta).\n\nAnd,\n\nsin(theta) cos(2 theta) = sin(theta) (2 cos\u00b2(theta) -1).\n\nSo,\n\ny = sin(theta) cos\u00b2(theta) - sin(theta) (2 cos\u00b2(theta) -1).\n\n= sin(theta) cos\u00b2(theta) - 2 sin(theta) cos\u00b2(theta) + sin(theta).\n\n= (- sin(theta) cos\u00b2(theta)) + sin(theta).\n\n= sin(theta) (1 - cos\u00b2(theta)).\n\n= sin(theta) sin\u00b2(theta).\n\n= sin\u00b3(theta).\n\nSo, y = sin\u00b3(theta).\n\nSimilarly, from earlier,\n\nx = [ sin(theta) y + cos(2 theta) ] / cos(theta).\n\nSubstitute y= sin\u00b3(theta):\n\nx = [ sin(theta) * sin\u00b3(theta) + cos(2 theta) ] / cos(theta).\n\n= [ sin^4(theta) + cos(2 theta) ] / cos(theta).\n\nHmm, let's try to simplify this.\n\nExpress cos(2 theta) as 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(theta).\n\nSo,\n\nx = [ sin^4(theta) + 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(theta) ] / cos(theta).\n\nFactor numerator:\n\nsin^4(theta) - 2 sin\u00b2(theta) +1 = (sin\u00b2(theta) -1)^2 = ( -cos\u00b2(theta) )^2 = cos^4(theta).\n\nSo,\n\nx = [ cos^4(theta) ] / cos(theta) = cos^3(theta).\n\nSo, x= cos^3(theta), y= sin^3(theta).\n\nThus, the envelope is parametrized by theta as x= cos^3(theta), y= sin^3(theta).\n\nSo, in Cartesian coordinates, we can write:\n\nx = cos^3(theta),\n\ny = sin^3(theta).\n\nSo, to eliminate theta, we can write:\n\nsqrt(x) = cos^(3/2)(theta),\n\nsqrt(y) = sin^(3/2)(theta).\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider the relation between x and y.\n\nWe have:\n\nx = cos^3(theta),\n\ny = sin^3(theta).\n\nSo, (x)^(2/3) = cos\u00b2(theta),\n\n(y)^(2/3) = sin\u00b2(theta).\n\nAdding them:\n\n(x)^(2/3) + (y)^(2/3) = cos\u00b2(theta) + sin\u00b2(theta) =1.\n\nSo, the envelope is the astroid (x)^(2/3) + (y)^(2/3) =1.\n\nAh, okay, so the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nThat makes more sense. So, the envelope is not the hyperbola I thought earlier, but an astroid.\n\nSo, I must have made a mistake in the earlier parametrization.\n\nTherefore, the correct envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nSo, the astroid is the envelope of the family F.\n\nSo, point C lies on AB and on this astroid, and AB is tangent to the astroid at C.\n\nSo, to find C, we need to solve the system:\n\n1. y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\n2. x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nWe can substitute equation 1 into equation 2.\n\nLet me write equation 2 as:\n\n(x)^(2/3) + (y)^(2/3) =1.\n\nSubstitute y:\n\n(x)^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) =1.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can make a substitution.\n\nLet me denote t = x^(1/3). Then, x = t^3.\n\nSimilarly, y = -sqrt(3) t^3 + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substitute into equation 2:\n\n(t^3)^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3) t^3 + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\nt^2 + [ sqrt(3)( -t^3 + 1/2 ) ]^(2/3) =1.\n\nFactor sqrt(3):\n\n= t^2 + [ sqrt(3) (1/2 - t^3) ]^(2/3).\n\nLet me compute [ sqrt(3) (1/2 - t^3) ]^(2/3).\n\nFirst, sqrt(3) is 3^(1/2), so:\n\n[3^(1/2) (1/2 - t^3)]^(2/3) = [3^(1/2)]^(2/3) * (1/2 - t^3)^(2/3).\n\n= 3^(1/3) * (1/2 - t^3)^(2/3).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nt^2 + 3^(1/3) (1/2 - t^3)^(2/3) =1.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can make a substitution u = t^3.\n\nLet me set u = t^3.\n\nThen, t = u^(1/3).\n\nSo, t^2 = u^(2/3).\n\nAnd, 1/2 - t^3 = 1/2 - u.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nu^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) (1/2 - u)^(2/3) =1.\n\nHmm, this is still quite messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that point C is such that x and y are related in a way that makes substitution easier.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the astroid.\n\nThe astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1 can be parametrized as:\n\nx = cos^3(theta),\n\ny = sin^3(theta).\n\nSo, let's see if AB is tangent to the astroid at point C.\n\nThe point C lies on both AB and the astroid.\n\nSo, let me write the parametric equations of the astroid:\n\nx = cos^3(theta),\n\ny = sin^3(theta).\n\nWe can also write the equation of the tangent to the astroid at theta.\n\nThe derivative dy/dx for the astroid can be found by differentiating implicitly:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx =0.\n\nSo,\n\ndy/dx = - [ (x)^( -1/3 ) ] / [ (y)^( -1/3 ) ] = - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)).\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent at (x,y) on the astroid is - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)).\n\nBut the line AB has slope m = -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, at point C, the slope of the astroid is -sqrt(3).\n\nTherefore,\n\n- (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3).\n\nSimplify:\n\n(y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)) = sqrt(3).\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3:\n\ny / x = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3^(3/2) = 3*sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\ny = 3 sqrt(3) x.\n\nBut we also know that point C lies on AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting y =3 sqrt(3) x into the equation of AB:\n\n3 sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n3 sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4 sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n4x = 1/2.\n\nSo,\n\nx = (1/2)/4 = 1/8.\n\nThen, y=3 sqrt(3) * (1/8) = 3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nNow, let's verify that this point lies on the astroid.\n\nCompute x^(2/3) + y^(2/3):\n\nx^(2/3) = (1/8)^(2/3) = (2^(-3))^(2/3) = 2^(-2) = 1/4.\n\ny^(2/3) = (3 sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3).\n\nFirst, write 3 sqrt(3) as 3^(3/2).\n\nSo, y=3^(3/2)/8.\n\nSo, y^(2/3) = [3^(3/2)/8]^(2/3) = 3^( (3/2)*(2/3) ) / 8^(2/3) = 3^1 / (8^(2/3)).\n\n8^(2/3) = (2^3)^(2/3) = 2^(2) =4.\n\nSo, y^(2/3)= 3/4.\n\nSo, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1/4 + 3/4 =1. Correct.\n\nSo, point C is indeed on the astroid.\n\nSo, OC is the distance from the origin to point C, which is sqrt( (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 ).\n\nCompute OC\u00b2:\n\n(1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 1/64 + (9*3)/64 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.\n\nSo, OC\u00b2=7/16.\n\nThus, p=7, q=16, so p+q=23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{23}\n\n\nGiven points \\( O(0,0) \\), \\( A\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right) \\), and \\( B\\left(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\), we need to find a point \\( C \\) on segment \\( \\overline{AB} \\) that does not belong to any other segment from the family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) of unit length segments lying in the first quadrant with \\( P \\) on the \\( x \\)-axis and \\( Q \\) on the \\( y \\)-axis, except for \\( \\overline{AB} \\).\n\n1. **Equation of Line \\( \\overline{AB} \\)**:\n   - The slope of \\( \\overline{AB} \\) is calculated as \\( -\\sqrt{3} \\).\n   - The equation of \\( \\overline{AB} \\) is \\( y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Envelope of the Family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\)**:\n   - The family of segments \\( \\overline{PQ} \\) can be parametrized by \\( t \\) as \\( t x + \\frac{y}{t} = 1 \\).\n   - The envelope of this family is found to be the astroid \\( x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1 \\).\n\n3. **Finding Point \\( C \\)**:\n   - The point \\( C \\) lies on both \\( \\overline{AB} \\) and the astroid.\n   - The slope of the tangent to the astroid at \\( C \\) must match the slope of \\( \\overline{AB} \\), which is \\( -\\sqrt{3} \\).\n   - Solving the system of equations, we find \\( C \\) at \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8} \\right) \\).\n\n4. **Distance Calculation**:\n   - The distance \\( OC \\) is calculated as \\( \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{1}{8} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8} \\right)^2} \\).\n   - Squaring this distance, we get \\( OC^2 = \\frac{7}{16} \\).\n\nThus, \\( OC^2 = \\frac{7}{16} \\), and the sum of the numerator and denominator is \\( 7 + 16 = 23 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{23}\n\\]",
