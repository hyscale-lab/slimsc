      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, 13th roots of unity... I remember they're complex numbers that satisfy \u03c9^13 = 1, right? So \u03c9^k for k=0,1,...,12 are all the distinct 13th roots.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the product looks like. The product is over all 13th roots of unity, except maybe k=0? Wait, no, it's from k=0 to 12, so it includes \u03c9^0, which is 1. So the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including 1.\n\nLet me write down the expression inside the product: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or relate it to some polynomial.\n\nWait, 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} looks similar to a quadratic in terms of \u03c9^k. Let me see: Let\u2019s let x = \u03c9^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x\u00b2. So that's x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nSo the expression becomes x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Hmm, can I factor this? Let me check the discriminant: b\u00b2 - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots would be [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So the quadratic factors into (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nTherefore, 2 - 2x + x\u00b2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So substituting back x = \u03c9^k, we have:\n\n(\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo the entire product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich is equal to [product from k=0 to 12 (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] multiplied by [product from k=0 to 12 (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nWait, I remember that for roots of unity, the product over all \u03c9^k - a can be related to a certain polynomial evaluated at a. Let me recall that the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But wait, actually, the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1, right? Because the roots of x^13 - 1 = 0 are exactly the 13th roots of unity.\n\nBut since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, the minimal polynomial is \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. So maybe I can use that.\n\nBut in this case, the product is over (\u03c9^k - a), not (x - \u03c9^k). Hmm. Wait, if I reverse the sign, (\u03c9^k - a) = -(a - \u03c9^k). So the product becomes (-1)^13 times the product of (a - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12. Which is (-1)^13 times the product of (a - \u03c9^k).\n\nBut the product of (a - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is equal to a^13 - 1, because that's the same as the product over (x - \u03c9^k) evaluated at x=a, which is a^13 - 1.\n\nSo, putting it together, product from k=0 to 12 (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 (a^13 - 1) = - (a^13 - 1) = 1 - a^13.\n\nSo in our case, for a = 1 + i, the product becomes 1 - (1 + i)^13. Similarly, for a = 1 - i, it's 1 - (1 - i)^13.\n\nSo the entire product is [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13].\n\nTherefore, the original product is equal to [1 - (1 + i)^13][1 - (1 - i)^13]. So now I need to compute this product.\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nFirst, note that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians. Similarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute [sqrt(2)]^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, for the angles: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let's compute 13 * \u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so let's subtract 2\u03c0: 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 5\u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0. Similarly, -13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to -5\u03c0/4, but adding 2\u03c0 gives 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = 64 sqrt(2) [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4} = 64 sqrt(2) [cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4)].\n\nCompute cos(5\u03c0/4) and sin(5\u03c0/4):\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nSimplify this:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) (1 + i) = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) * (1 + i).\n\nCompute sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2, so:\n\n64 * (-2/2) * (1 + i) = 64 * (-1) * (1 + i) = -64 (1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (-sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nWait, no, let me compute that again. [cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4)] is (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nAgain, sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2, so:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) + 64 sqrt(2) * i (sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) + 64 * i (2/2) = 64*(-1) + 64*i*1 = -64 + 64i.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I should factor this differently.\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i). Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\n(1 + i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i.\n\n(1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4.\n\n(1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i)^4 * (1 + i)^1 = 16 * (-4) * (1 + i) = -64 (1 + i). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^2 = 1 - 2i + i^2 = 1 - 2i -1 = -2i.\n\n(1 - i)^4 = (-2i)^2 = -4.\n\n(1 - i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.\n\n(1 - i)^13 = (1 - i)^8 * (1 - i)^4 * (1 - i)^1 = 16*(-4)*(1 - i) = -64(1 - i).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), and (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, 1 - (1 + i)^13 = 1 - (-64)(1 + i) = 1 + 64(1 + i) = 65 + 64i.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - (1 - i)^13 = 1 - (-64)(1 - i) = 1 + 64(1 - i) = 65 - 64i.\n\nSo now, the product is (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i). That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's the square of the modulus.\n\nCompute (65)^2 + (64)^2. Let's compute 65^2 = 4225, 64^2 = 4096. So total is 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, wait: (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, but wait no, that's for (a + b)(a - b). Wait no, in this case, it's (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65\u00b2 - (64i)^2 = 65\u00b2 - (64)^2 (i^2) = 65\u00b2 - (64)^2 (-1) = 65\u00b2 + 64\u00b2.\n\nYes, exactly. So that's 65\u00b2 + 64\u00b2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo the product is 8321. Now, we need to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000.\n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, with a remainder of 321.\n\nSo the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my steps because 8321 seems a bit high for the product of such terms, but let's see.\n\nWait, the product was [1 - (1 + i)^13][1 - (1 - i)^13] which became (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65\u00b2 + 64\u00b2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, the product over (\u03c9^k - a) was equal to 1 - a^13, right? Because we had product (\u03c9^k - a) = 1 - a^13.\n\nWait, no, earlier, I thought that product (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 (a^13 - 1) = 1 - a^13. So that's correct.\n\nSo then, when I multiplied [1 - (1 + i)^13][1 - (1 - i)^13], which is (1 - a)(1 - b), where a = (1 + i)^13, b = (1 - i)^13, which are -64(1 + i) and -64(1 - i), so 1 - a is 1 + 64(1 + i), which is 65 + 64i, and 1 - b is 65 - 64i.\n\nMultiplying those gives 65^2 + 64^2 = 8321, correct.\n\nSo, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me think again: Is the product of (\u03c9^k - a) equal to 1 - a^13? Let me make sure.\n\nWe had product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = (-1)^13 (a^13 - 1) = -(a^13 - 1) = 1 - a^13.\n\nYes, that's correct. So that part is solid.\n\nSo, all the steps check out, so the final product is 8321, which mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but wait a second: 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with remainder 321. Yes.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nSo the answer is 321.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by expressing the given product in terms of roots of unity.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, 13th roots of unity... I remember they're complex numbers that satisfy \u03c9^13 = 1, right?

Maybe I can factor this or relate it to some polynomial.\n\nWait, 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} looks similar to a quadratic in terms of \u03c9^k. Let me see: Let\u2019s let x = \u03c9^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x\u00b2. So that's x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nSo the expression becomes x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Hmm, can I factor this? Let me check the discriminant: b\u00b2 - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots would be [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So the quadratic factors into (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nTherefore, 2 - 2x + x\u00b2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So substituting back x = \u03c9^k, we have:\n\n(\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo the entire product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich is equal to [product from k=0 to 12 (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] multiplied by [product from k=0 to 12 (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nWait, I remember that for roots of unity, the product over all \u03c9^k - a can be related to a certain polynomial evaluated at a. Let me recall that the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But wait, actually, the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1, right? Because the roots of x^13 - 1 = 0 are exactly the 13th roots of unity.\n\nBut since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, the minimal polynomial is \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. So maybe I can use that.\n\nBut in this case, the product is over (\u03c9^k - a), not (x - \u03c9^k). Hmm. Wait, if I reverse the sign, (\u03c9^k - a) = -(a - \u03c9^k). So the product becomes (-1)^13 times the product of (a - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12. Which is (-1)^13 times the product of (a - \u03c9^k).\n\nBut the product of (a - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is equal to a^13 - 1, because that's the same as the product over (x - \u03c9^k) evaluated at x=a, which is a^13 - 1.\n\nSo, putting it together, product from k=0 to 12 (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 (a^13 - 1) = - (a^13 - 1) = 1 - a^13.\n\nSo in our case, for a = 1 + i, the product becomes 1 - (1 + i)^13. Similarly, for a = 1 - i, it's 1 - (1 - i)^13.\n\nSo the entire product is [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13].\n\nTherefore, the original product is equal to [1 - (1 + i)^13][1 - (1 - i)^13]. So now I need to compute this product.\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nFirst, note that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians. Similarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute [sqrt(2)]^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, for the angles: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let's compute 13 * \u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so let's subtract 2\u03c0: 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 5\u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0. Similarly, -13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to -5\u03c0/4, but adding 2\u03c0 gives 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = 64 sqrt(2) [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4} = 64 sqrt(2) [cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4)].\n\nCompute cos(5\u03c0/4) and sin(5\u03c0/4):\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nSimplify this:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) (1 + i) = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) * (1 + i).\n\nCompute sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2, so:\n\n64 * (-2/2) * (1 + i) = 64 * (-1) * (1 + i) = -64 (1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (-sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nWait, no, let me compute that again. [cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4)] is (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nAgain, sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2, so:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) + 64 sqrt(2) * i (sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) + 64 * i (2/2) = 64*(-1) + 64*i*1 = -64 + 64i.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I should factor this differently.\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i). Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\n(1 + i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i.\n\n(1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4.\n\n(1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i)^4 * (1 + i)^1 = 16 * (-4) * (1 + i) = -64 (1 + i). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^2 = 1 - 2i + i^2 = 1 - 2i -1 = -2i.\n\n(1 - i)^4 = (-2i)^2 = -4.\n\n(1 - i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.\n\n(1 - i)^13 = (1 - i)^8 * (1 - i)^4 * (1 - i)^1 = 16*(-4)*(1 - i) = -64(1 - i).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), and (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, 1 - (1 + i)^13 = 1 - (-64)(1 + i) = 1 + 64(1 + i) = 65 + 64i.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - (1 - i)^13 = 1 - (-64)(1 - i) = 1 + 64(1 - i) = 65 - 64i.\n\nSo now, the product is (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i). That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's the square of the modulus.\n\nCompute (65)^2 + (64)^2. Let's compute 65^2 = 4225, 64^2 = 4096. So total is 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, wait: (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, but wait no, that's for (a + b)(a - b). Wait no, in this case, it's (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65\u00b2 - (64i)^2 = 65\u00b2 - (64)^2 (i^2) = 65\u00b2 - (64)^2 (-1) = 65\u00b2 + 64\u00b2.\n\nYes, exactly. So that's 65\u00b2 + 64\u00b2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo the product is 8321. Now, we need to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000.\n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, with a remainder of 321.\n\nSo the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my steps because 8321 seems a bit high for the product of such terms, but let's see.\n\nWait, the product was [1 - (1 + i)^13][1 - (1 - i)^13] which became (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65\u00b2 + 64\u00b2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, the product over (\u03c9^k - a) was equal to 1 - a^13, right? Because we had product (\u03c9^k - a) = 1 - a^13.\n\nWait, no, earlier, I thought that product (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 (a^13 - 1) = 1 - a^13. So that's correct.\n\nSo then, when I multiplied [1 - (1 + i)^13][1 - (1 - i)^13], which is (1 - a)(1 - b), where a = (1 + i)^13, b = (1 - i)^13, which are -64(1 + i) and -64(1 - i), so 1 - a is 1 + 64(1 + i), which is 65 + 64i, and 1 - b is 65 - 64i.\n\nMultiplying those gives 65^2 + 64^2 = 8321, correct.\n\nSo, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me think again: Is the product of (\u03c9^k - a) equal to 1 - a^13? Let me make sure.\n\nWe had product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = (-1)^13 (a^13 - 1) = -(a^13 - 1) = 1 - a^13.\n\nYes, that's correct. So that part is solid.\n\nSo, all the steps check out, so the final product is 8321, which mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but wait a second: 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with remainder 321. Yes.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nSo the answer is 321.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by expressing the given product in terms of roots of unity. Let \u03c9 be a primitive 13th root of unity, and consider the product:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}).\n\\]\n\nWe rewrite the quadratic expression inside the product as \\(2 - 2x + x^2\\) where \\(x = \\omega^k\\). Factoring this quadratic, we get:\n\n\\[\n2 - 2x + x^2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\\]\n\nThus, the product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 + i))(\\omega^k - (1 - i)).\n\\]\n\nThis can be separated into two products:\n\n\\[\n\\left[\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 + i))\\right] \\cdot \\left[\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 - i))\\right].\n\\]\n\nUsing the property of roots of unity, we know that:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - a) = 1 - a^{13}.\n\\]\n\nApplying this, we find:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 + i)) = 1 - (1 + i)^{13},\n\\]\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 - i)) = 1 - (1 - i)^{13}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we compute \\((1 + i)^{13}\\) and \\((1 - i)^{13}\\). Expressing \\(1 + i\\) and \\(1 - i\\) in polar form, we find their magnitudes are \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and their arguments are \\(\\pi/4\\) and \\(-\\pi/4\\), respectively. Raising them to the 13th power:\n\n\\[\n(1 + i)^{13} = (\\sqrt{2})^{13} e^{i \\cdot 13 \\cdot \\pi/4} = 64\\sqrt{2} e^{i \\cdot 5\\pi/4} = -64(1 + i),\n\\]\n\\[\n(1 - i)^{13} = (\\sqrt{2})^{13} e^{-i \\cdot 13 \\cdot \\pi/4} = 64\\sqrt{2} e^{-i \\cdot 5\\pi/4} = -64(1 - i).\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n1 - (1 + i)^{13} = 1 + 64(1 + i) = 65 + 64i,\n\\]\n\\[\n1 - (1 - i)^{13} = 1 + 64(1 - i) = 65 - 64i.\n\\]\n\nThe product is:\n\n\\[\n(65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65^2 + 64^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000:\n\n\\[\n8321 \\mod 1000 = 321.\n\\]\n\nThus, the remainder is \\(\\boxed{321}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and \u03c9 isn't equal to 1. Hmm, alright, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to cyclotomic polynomials. Maybe I can use those properties here. The expression given is a product over all 13th roots of unity (except \u03c9=1) of a certain quadratic expression in \u03c9^k. So, perhaps I can relate this product to some polynomial evaluated at specific points.\n\nLet me write down the expression again: the product is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Wait, but when k=0, \u03c9^0 is 1, so let me check what that term is. Plugging k=0: 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the first term is 1. Hmm, that's interesting. So actually, the product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nSo maybe it's easier to consider the product from k=1 to 12. Let me denote \u03c9^k as x for each k. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, each x is also a primitive 13th root except when k=0. So, for each x \u2260 1, x^13 = 1, and x^m \u2260 1 for 0 < m < 13.\n\nSo, the expression becomes the product over x \u2260 1 of (2 - 2x + x^2). Let me rewrite that expression: 2 - 2x + x^2 can be rearranged as x^2 - 2x + 2. So, the product is the product over all x \u2260 1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2).\n\nWait, but since x is a root of x^13 - 1 = 0, except x=1, perhaps I can relate this product to the value of some polynomial evaluated at certain points. Specifically, I remember that the product of (x - a) over all roots x of a polynomial P is equal to P(a), up to a sign, if P splits into linear factors.\n\nBut here, the product isn't (x - a), it's (x^2 - 2x + 2). So maybe I can think of this as evaluating a polynomial at certain points. Let me think: if I have a polynomial Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2, then the product over all roots x (except 1) of Q(x) would be the product Q(x) for x in the roots except x=1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity, which is x^13 - 1. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, the minimal polynomial is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But maybe I can relate this product to \u03a6_13(x) somehow.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps consider that the product over x \u2260 1 of Q(x) is equal to the resultant or something similar. Or, more straightforwardly, perhaps express the product as the value of a certain polynomial evaluated at specific points.\n\nWait, let me consider that the product over all x \u2260 1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over all x \u2260 1 of Q(x). But since the roots x are the 13th roots of unity except 1, maybe I can consider the product over all x \u2260 1 of Q(x) as the product over all x where x^13 = 1, x \u2260 1, of Q(x). \n\nI recall that for a polynomial f(x), the product of f(x) over all roots x of another polynomial g(x) can be found using the resultant or by evaluating the product via the factor theorem. Alternatively, perhaps I can use logarithms, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of polynomials. Let me consider that the product over x \u2260 1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product of (x^2 - 2x + 2) as x runs over all 13th roots of unity except x=1. Since each x is a root of x^13 - 1 = 0, maybe I can relate this product to evaluating another polynomial at specific points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the product over x \u2260 1 of (x - a) is equal to \u03a6_13(a), the 13th cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at a. But in this case, it's not (x - a), it's (x^2 - 2x + 2). Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Let me compute its roots. The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, Q(x) factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, the product over x \u2260 1 of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)) is equal to the product over x \u2260 1 of Q(x).\n\nBut the product over x \u2260 1 of (x - a) is equal to \u03a6_13(a) times (1 - a), because \u03a6_13(x) is the product over x \u2260 1 of (x - a). Wait, no, actually, \u03a6_n(x) is the product of (x - \u03b6) where \u03b6 runs over the primitive nth roots of unity. But in our case, x runs over all 13th roots of unity except 1, which includes both primitive and non-primitive roots. Wait, but 13 is prime, so all roots except 1 are primitive. So \u03a6_13(x) = product_{x \u2260 1} (x - \u03b6), where \u03b6 are the primitive 13th roots of unity.\n\nWait, but in our product, the x's are all 13th roots of unity except 1, which are precisely the primitive 13th roots. So, the product over x \u2260 1 of (x - a) is \u03a6_13(a). So, for our case, product_{x \u22601} (x - a) = \u03a6_13(a). But in our case, the product is product_{x \u22601} (x^2 - 2x + 2) = product_{x \u22601} (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, that would be equal to product_{x \u22601} (x - (1 + i)) * product_{x \u22601} (x - (1 - i)).\n\nBut each of these products is \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i). So, the total product is \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nSo, now I need to compute \u03a6_13(a) where a is 1 + i and 1 - i.\n\nBut \u03a6_13(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. So, \u03a6_13(a) = a^12 + a^11 + ... + a + 1.\n\nSo, let's compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i), then multiply them together.\n\nBut that seems a bit involved. Maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute \u03a6_13(a) for a = 1 + i and a = 1 - i, and then multiply the results.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that \u03a6_n(a) is the minimal polynomial over integers for primitive nth roots. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps we can express \u03a6_13(a) as (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1), since for a \u2260 1, \u03a6_13(a) = (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1). So, \u03a6_13(a) = (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1).\n\nSo, for a = 1 + i, compute ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / i.\n\nSimilarly, for a = 1 - i, compute ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i).\n\nSo, let's compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 first.\n\nFirst, note that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) e^{i \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) e^{-i \u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, raising to the 13th power:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^{13} first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the angles:\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = (12 + 1) * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since e^{i \u03b8} is periodic modulo 2\u03c0, e^{i 3\u03c0 + i \u03c0/4} = e^{i \u03c0/4} * e^{i 3\u03c0} = e^{i \u03c0/4} * (-1), because e^{i \u03c0} = -1, so e^{i 3\u03c0} = e^{i \u03c0} * e^{i 2\u03c0} = (-1) * 1 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i 13 \u03c0/4} = e^{-i (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i \u03c0/4} * e^{-i 3\u03c0} = e^{-i \u03c0/4} * (-1).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * (-1) e^{i \u03c0/4} = -64 sqrt(2) (cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)) = -64 sqrt(2) ( (sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ) = -64 sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i) = -64 * (1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * (-1) e^{-i \u03c0/4} = -64 sqrt(2) (cos(-\u03c0/4) + i sin(-\u03c0/4)) = -64 sqrt(2) ( sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = -64 sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 (1 - i) = -64 (1 - i).\n\nSo, now, compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = [ (-64 (1 + i) ) - 1 ] / (i).\n\nLet me compute numerator: -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nDenominator is i.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = (-65 -64i) / i. Let's divide this by i.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by -i (since 1/i = -i):\n\n(-65 -64i) * (-i) / (i * -i) = (65i + 64i^2) / 1 = 65i - 64.\n\nBecause i^2 = -1. So, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = -64 + 65i.\n\nSimilarly, compute \u03a6_13(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = [ (-64 (1 - i) ) - 1 ] / (-i).\n\nCompute numerator: -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nDenominator is -i.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i). Let's divide this by -i.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n(-65 +64i) * i / (-i * i) = (-65i +64i^2) / 1 = (-65i -64) / 1 = -64 -65i.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check the denominator: (1 - i) -1 = -i, correct. So, denominator is -i.\n\nSo, (-65 +64i)/(-i) = multiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\nNumerator: (-65 +64i) * i = -65i +64i^2 = -65i -64.\n\nDenominator: (-i) * i = -i^2 = 1.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.\n\nSo, now, the product \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) = (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i).\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nCompute modulus squared: (-64)^2 + (65)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nWait, let me compute 64^2: 64*64=4096, 65^2=4225. So, 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but hold on, our original product is product_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = 1 * product_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nWhich we found is equal to \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) = 8321.\n\nBut wait, 8321 is the product of the two terms. So, the entire product is 8321.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss a step. The product from k=0 to 12 includes k=0, which is 1, so the total product is 1 * product_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = product_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = 8321.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, with remainder 321.\n\nWait, 8321 - 8*1000 = 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me confirm.\n\nWait, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8.321, so the integer part is 8, so 8*1000=8000, subtract that from 8321: 8321 - 8000 = 321. So yes, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again because I might have made a mistake in calculating \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nWait, \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1). So, when x =1 +i, \u03a6_13(1+i) = [(1+i)^13 -1]/[(1+i)-1] = [(-64 (1 +i)) -1]/i = (-64 -64i -1)/i = (-65 -64i)/i.\n\nWhich is (-65 -64i)/i. Multiplying numerator and denominator by -i: (-65 -64i)(-i) / (i * -i) = (65i +64i^2)/1 = 65i -64. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for x=1 -i, \u03a6_13(1 -i) = [(-64 (1 -i)) -1]/( -i ) = (-64 +64i -1)/(-i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65 +64i) * i / (-i * i) = (-65i +64i^2)/1 = (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.\n\nSo, yes, the product is (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 + (65)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nSo, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me check if 8321 is correct. Because 13th roots of unity, product over all except 1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) is 8321. So, yeah, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 321.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and \u03c9 isn't equal to 1. Hmm, alright, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to cyclotomic polynomials. Maybe I can use those properties here. The expression given is a product over all 13th roots of unity (except \u03c9=1) of a certain quadratic expression in \u03c9^k. So, perhaps I can relate this product to some polynomial evaluated at specific points.\n\nLet me write down the expression again: the product is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Wait, but when k=0, \u03c9^0 is 1, so let me check what that term is. Plugging k=0: 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the first term is 1. Hmm, that's interesting. So actually, the product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nSo maybe it's easier to consider the product from k=1 to 12. Let me denote \u03c9^k as x for each k. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, each x is also a primitive 13th root except when k=0. So, for each x \u2260 1, x^13 = 1, and x^m \u2260 1 for 0 < m < 13.\n\nSo, the expression becomes the product over x \u2260 1 of (2 - 2x + x^2). Let me rewrite that expression: 2 - 2x + x^2 can be rearranged as x^2 - 2x + 2. So, the product is the product over all x \u2260 1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2).\n\nWait, but since x is a root of x^13 - 1 = 0, except x=1, perhaps I can relate this product to the value of some polynomial evaluated at certain points. Specifically, I remember that the product of (x - a) over all roots x of a polynomial P is equal to P(a), up to a sign, if P splits into linear factors.\n\nBut here, the product isn't (x - a), it's (x^2 - 2x + 2). So maybe I can think of this as evaluating a polynomial at certain points. Let me think: if I have a polynomial Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2, then the product over all roots x (except 1) of Q(x) would be the product Q(x) for x in the roots except x=1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity, which is x^13 - 1. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, the minimal polynomial is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But maybe I can relate this product to \u03a6_13(x) somehow.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps consider that the product over x \u2260 1 of Q(x) is equal to the resultant or something similar. Or, more straightforwardly, perhaps express the product as the value of a certain polynomial evaluated at specific points.\n\nWait, let me consider that the product over all x \u2260 1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over all x \u2260 1 of Q(x). But since the roots x are the 13th roots of unity except 1, maybe I can consider the product over all x \u2260 1 of Q(x) as the product over all x where x^13 = 1, x \u2260 1, of Q(x). \n\nI recall that for a polynomial f(x), the product of f(x) over all roots x of another polynomial g(x) can be found using the resultant or by evaluating the product via the factor theorem. Alternatively, perhaps I can use logarithms, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of polynomials. Let me consider that the product over x \u2260 1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product of (x^2 - 2x + 2) as x runs over all 13th roots of unity except x=1. Since each x is a root of x^13 - 1 = 0, maybe I can relate this product to evaluating another polynomial at specific points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the product over x \u2260 1 of (x - a) is equal to \u03a6_13(a), the 13th cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at a. But in this case, it's not (x - a), it's (x^2 - 2x + 2). Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Let me compute its roots. The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, Q(x) factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, the product over x \u2260 1 of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)) is equal to the product over x \u2260 1 of Q(x).\n\nBut the product over x \u2260 1 of (x - a) is equal to \u03a6_13(a) times (1 - a), because \u03a6_13(x) is the product over x \u2260 1 of (x - a). Wait, no, actually, \u03a6_n(x) is the product of (x - \u03b6) where \u03b6 runs over the primitive nth roots of unity. But in our case, x runs over all 13th roots of unity except 1, which includes both primitive and non-primitive roots. Wait, but 13 is prime, so all roots except 1 are primitive. So \u03a6_13(x) = product_{x \u2260 1} (x - \u03b6), where \u03b6 are the primitive 13th roots of unity.\n\nWait, but in our product, the x's are all 13th roots of unity except 1, which are precisely the primitive 13th roots. So, the product over x \u2260 1 of (x - a) is \u03a6_13(a). So, for our case, product_{x \u22601} (x - a) = \u03a6_13(a). But in our case, the product is product_{x \u22601} (x^2 - 2x + 2) = product_{x \u22601} (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, that would be equal to product_{x \u22601} (x - (1 + i)) * product_{x \u22601} (x - (1 - i)).\n\nBut each of these products is \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i). So, the total product is \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nSo, now I need to compute \u03a6_13(a) where a is 1 + i and 1 - i.\n\nBut \u03a6_13(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. So, \u03a6_13(a) = a^12 + a^11 + ... + a + 1.\n\nSo, let's compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i), then multiply them together.\n\nBut that seems a bit involved. Maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute \u03a6_13(a) for a = 1 + i and a = 1 - i, and then multiply the results.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that \u03a6_n(a) is the minimal polynomial over integers for primitive nth roots. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps we can express \u03a6_13(a) as (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1), since for a \u2260 1, \u03a6_13(a) = (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1). So, \u03a6_13(a) = (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1).\n\nSo, for a = 1 + i, compute ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / i.\n\nSimilarly, for a = 1 - i, compute ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i).\n\nSo, let's compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 first.\n\nFirst, note that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) e^{i \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) e^{-i \u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, raising to the 13th power:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^{13} first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the angles:\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = (12 + 1) * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since e^{i \u03b8} is periodic modulo 2\u03c0, e^{i 3\u03c0 + i \u03c0/4} = e^{i \u03c0/4} * e^{i 3\u03c0} = e^{i \u03c0/4} * (-1), because e^{i \u03c0} = -1, so e^{i 3\u03c0} = e^{i \u03c0} * e^{i 2\u03c0} = (-1) * 1 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i 13 \u03c0/4} = e^{-i (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i \u03c0/4} * e^{-i 3\u03c0} = e^{-i \u03c0/4} * (-1).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * (-1) e^{i \u03c0/4} = -64 sqrt(2) (cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)) = -64 sqrt(2) ( (sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ) = -64 sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i) = -64 * (1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * (-1) e^{-i \u03c0/4} = -64 sqrt(2) (cos(-\u03c0/4) + i sin(-\u03c0/4)) = -64 sqrt(2) ( sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = -64 sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 (1 - i) = -64 (1 - i).\n\nSo, now, compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = [ (-64 (1 + i) ) - 1 ] / (i).\n\nLet me compute numerator: -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nDenominator is i.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = (-65 -64i) / i. Let's divide this by i.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by -i (since 1/i = -i):\n\n(-65 -64i) * (-i) / (i * -i) = (65i + 64i^2) / 1 = 65i - 64.\n\nBecause i^2 = -1. So, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = -64 + 65i.\n\nSimilarly, compute \u03a6_13(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = [ (-64 (1 - i) ) - 1 ] / (-i).\n\nCompute numerator: -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nDenominator is -i.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i). Let's divide this by -i.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n(-65 +64i) * i / (-i * i) = (-65i +64i^2) / 1 = (-65i -64) / 1 = -64 -65i.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check the denominator: (1 - i) -1 = -i, correct. So, denominator is -i.\n\nSo, (-65 +64i)/(-i) = multiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\nNumerator: (-65 +64i) * i = -65i +64i^2 = -65i -64.\n\nDenominator: (-i) * i = -i^2 = 1.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.\n\nSo, now, the product \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) = (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i).\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nCompute modulus squared: (-64)^2 + (65)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nWait, let me compute 64^2: 64*64=4096, 65^2=4225. So, 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but hold on, our original product is product_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = 1 * product_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nWhich we found is equal to \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) = 8321.\n\nBut wait, 8321 is the product of the two terms. So, the entire product is 8321.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss a step. The product from k=0 to 12 includes k=0, which is 1, so the total product is 1 * product_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = product_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = 8321.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, with remainder 321.\n\nWait, 8321 - 8*1000 = 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me confirm.\n\nWait, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8.321, so the integer part is 8, so 8*1000=8000, subtract that from 8321: 8321 - 8000 = 321. So yes, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again because I might have made a mistake in calculating \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nWait, \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1). So, when x =1 +i, \u03a6_13(1+i) = [(1+i)^13 -1]/[(1+i)-1] = [(-64 (1 +i)) -1]/i = (-64 -64i -1)/i = (-65 -64i)/i.\n\nWhich is (-65 -64i)/i. Multiplying numerator and denominator by -i: (-65 -64i)(-i) / (i * -i) = (65i +64i^2)/1 = 65i -64. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for x=1 -i, \u03a6_13(1 -i) = [(-64 (1 -i)) -1]/( -i ) = (-64 +64i -1)/(-i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65 +64i) * i / (-i * i) = (-65i +64i^2)/1 = (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.\n\nSo, yes, the product is (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 + (65)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nSo, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me check if 8321 is correct. Because 13th roots of unity, product over all except 1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) is 8321. So, yeah, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 321.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive 13th root of unity.\n\nFirst, note that when \\(k=0\\), the term is 1. Thus, the product simplifies to \\(1 \\times \\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\). \n\nRewriting each term as \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\) where \\(x = \\omega^k\\), the product becomes \\(\\prod_{k=1}^{12}(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\). Recognizing that \\(x\\) runs over all primitive 13th roots of unity except 1, this product can be expressed as \\(\\Phi_{13}(1 + i) \\cdot \\Phi_{13}(1 - i)\\), where \\(\\Phi_{13}(x)\\) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial.\n\nUsing the formula \\(\\Phi_{13}(x) = \\frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1}\\), we compute \\(\\Phi_{13}(1 + i)\\) and \\(\\Phi_{13}(1 - i)\\). After evaluating these, we find the product to be 8321. \n\nFinally, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{321}\\)",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let's try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy the equation \u03c9^n = 1, where n is the order. In this case, \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, so \u03c9^13 = 1, and none of the lower exponents will give 1 except for \u03c9^0 = 1.\n\nThe product is from k=0 to 12, which covers all the 13th roots of unity. Each term in the product is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. I wonder if there's a way to simplify this expression or find a pattern.\n\nLet me write the term as 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Maybe factor something out? Let's see:\n\n2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2.\n\nHmm, that looks a bit like a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me denote x = \u03c9^k. Then the term becomes x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. So each term is a quadratic in x, where x is a 13th root of unity.\n\nSo the entire product is the product from k=0 to 12 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2), where x = \u03c9^k. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, as k goes from 0 to 12, x takes on all 13th roots of unity, including 1 when k=0.\n\nWait, but when k=0, x=\u03c9^0=1. So the term becomes 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So the first term is 1, and the rest are the other roots.\n\nSo the product is 1 * product from k=1 to 12 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). Now, perhaps I can relate this product to a polynomial whose roots are these x's.\n\nSince x are the 13th roots of unity, except x=1, they satisfy x^13 = 1. So, the minimal polynomial for x is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if that's directly helpful. Alternatively, the product over (x - a_k) for all roots a_k of a polynomial is the polynomial itself, up to a constant factor. So, if I can find a polynomial whose roots are x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, then the product would be related to that.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think differently. Since each x is a root of x^13 = 1, except x=1, perhaps I can express x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 in terms of x^13 - 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the product as evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points.\n\nWait, another thought: For each x \u2260 1, x is a root of \u03a6_13(x) = 0. So, perhaps if I can write the product as \u03a6_13 evaluated at something.\n\nWait, but each term is a quadratic in x. Maybe I can consider the product over (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) as the product over (x - \u03b1)(x - \u03b2), where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are roots of the quadratic equation x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0.\n\nLet me compute the roots of x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, x = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 2i] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, \u03b1 = 1 + i and \u03b2 = 1 - i.\n\nTherefore, each term (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nSo the product from k=0 to 12 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product from k=0 to 12 of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nBut x here is \u03c9^k, so each term becomes (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo the entire product is the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nBut wait, the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - a) is equal to the product over all 13th roots of unity of (x - a). I remember that the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1, because the roots of x^13 - 1 are exactly the 13th roots of unity.\n\nBut in our case, we have a product of (\u03c9^k - a) for each k. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, if I take the product from k=0 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1. So, if I set x = a, then the product from k=0 to 12 of (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1. So the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 (a^13 - 1) = -(a^13 - 1) = 1 - a^13.\n\nSo in our case, the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = 1 - (1 + i)^13.\n\nSimilarly, the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = 1 - (1 - i)^13.\n\nTherefore, the original product is [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13].\n\nSo now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract each from 1, and then multiply the two results together.\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^13 first. I know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -\u03c0/4, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the angles. For (1 + i)^13, the exponent is 13 * \u03c0/4. Let's reduce this modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = (12 + 1) * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0 (because 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0), so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, for (1 - i)^13, the angle is -13\u03c0/4. Let's compute that:\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = -(12\u03c0/4 + \u03c0/4) = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 to make it positive: -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = \u03c0 - \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Alternatively, -13\u03c0/4 can be written as - (13/4)\u03c0. Let's add 2\u03c0 multiple times until it's within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n13/4 = 3.25. So, 13/4 \u03c0 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. To get the positive angle, we can subtract 2\u03c0 once: 13/4 \u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = 13/4 \u03c0 - 8/4 \u03c0 = 5/4 \u03c0. So, the angle is 5\u03c0/4. Wait, but for (1 - i), the angle is negative, so perhaps I should think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)}. Since e^{-i*3\u03c0} = e^{-i\u03c0} because 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0). So, e^{-i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i\u03c0} * e^{-i\u03c0/4} = (-1) * (cos(\u03c0/4) - i sin(\u03c0/4)) = (-1) * (\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2) = -\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since (1 + i) and (1 - i) are conjugates, their powers will also be conjugates. So, (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 are complex conjugates.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = a + bi, and (1 - i)^13 = a - bi.\n\nSo, [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13] = [1 - (a + bi)] [1 - (a - bi)] = (1 - a - bi)(1 - a + bi).\n\nMultiplying these two terms: (1 - a)^2 - (bi)^2 = (1 - 2a + a\u00b2) - (b\u00b2 i\u00b2) = (1 - 2a + a\u00b2) + b\u00b2, since i\u00b2 = -1.\n\nSo, it's equal to (1 - 2a + a\u00b2 + b\u00b2).\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, I can compute each term separately.\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^13:\n\n(1 + i)^1 = 1 + i\n(1 + i)^2 = (1 + i)(1 + i) = 1 + 2i + i\u00b2 = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i\n(1 + i)^3 = (1 + i)^2 (1 + i) = (2i)(1 + i) = 2i + 2i\u00b2 = 2i - 2 = -2 + 2i\n(1 + i)^4 = (1 + i)^2 * (1 + i)^2 = (2i)(2i) = 4i\u00b2 = -4\n(1 + i)^5 = (1 + i)^4 * (1 + i) = (-4)(1 + i) = -4 -4i\n(1 + i)^6 = (1 + i)^5 * (1 + i) = (-4 -4i)(1 + i) = -4(1 + i) -4i(1 + i) = -4 -4i -4i -4i\u00b2 = -4 -8i +4 = 0 -8i = -8i\n(1 + i)^7 = (1 + i)^6 * (1 + i) = (-8i)(1 + i) = -8i -8i\u00b2 = -8i +8 = 8 -8i\n(1 + i)^8 = (1 + i)^4 * (1 + i)^4 = (-4)(-4) = 16\n(1 + i)^9 = (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i) = 16(1 + i) = 16 +16i\n(1 + i)^10 = (1 + i)^9 * (1 + i) = (16 +16i)(1 + i) = 16(1 + i) +16i(1 + i) = 16 +16i +16i +16i\u00b2 = 16 +32i -16 = 0 +32i =32i\n(1 + i)^11 = (1 + i)^10 * (1 + i) = (32i)(1 + i) =32i +32i\u00b2=32i -32= -32 +32i\n(1 + i)^12 = (1 + i)^11 * (1 + i) = (-32 +32i)(1 + i)= -32(1 + i) +32i(1 +i)= -32 -32i +32i +32i\u00b2= -32 +0i -32= -64\n(1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^12 * (1 + i) = (-64)(1 + i)= -64 -64i\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13: Since (1 - i) is the conjugate of (1 + i), so (1 - i)^13 will be the conjugate of (1 + i)^13. So (1 - i)^13 = (-64 +64i).\n\nWait, let me check that. Let me compute (1 - i)^13 using the same method.\n\n(1 - i)^1 = 1 -i\n(1 - i)^2 = (1 - i)(1 - i)=1 -2i +i\u00b2=1 -2i -1= -2i\n(1 - i)^3 = (1 -i)^2 (1 -i)= (-2i)(1 -i)= -2i +2i\u00b2= -2i -2= -2 -2i\n(1 -i)^4 = (1 -i)^2 * (1 -i)^2= (-2i)(-2i)=4i\u00b2= -4\n(1 -i)^5 = (1 -i)^4 (1 -i)= (-4)(1 -i)= -4 +4i\n(1 -i)^6 = (1 -i)^5 (1 -i)= (-4 +4i)(1 -i)= -4(1 -i) +4i(1 -i)= -4 +4i +4i -4i\u00b2= -4 +8i +4= 0 +8i=8i\n(1 -i)^7 = (1 -i)^6 (1 -i)= (8i)(1 -i)=8i -8i\u00b2=8i +8=8 +8i\n(1 -i)^8 = (1 -i)^4 * (1 -i)^4= (-4)(-4)=16\n(1 -i)^9 = (1 -i)^8 (1 -i)=16(1 -i)=16 -16i\n(1 -i)^10 = (1 -i)^9 (1 -i)= (16 -16i)(1 -i)=16(1 -i) -16i(1 -i)=16 -16i -16i +16i\u00b2=16 -32i -16=0 -32i= -32i\n(1 -i)^11 = (1 -i)^10 (1 -i)= (-32i)(1 -i)= -32i +32i\u00b2= -32i -32= -32 -32i\n(1 -i)^12 = (1 -i)^11 (1 -i)= (-32 -32i)(1 -i)= -32(1 -i) -32i(1 -i)= -32 +32i -32i +32i\u00b2= -32 +0i -32= -64\n(1 -i)^13 = (1 -i)^12 (1 -i)= (-64)(1 -i)= -64 +64i\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i, and (1 -i)^13 = -64 +64i.\n\nSo, going back, the product [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 -i)^13] becomes [1 - (-64 -64i)] * [1 - (-64 +64i)].\n\nSimplify each bracket:\n\nFirst bracket: 1 - (-64 -64i) = 1 +64 +64i =65 +64i\n\nSecond bracket:1 - (-64 +64i) =1 +64 -64i=65 -64i\n\nNow, multiply these two complex numbers: (65 +64i)(65 -64i). This is a product of conjugates, so it's equal to (65)^2 + (64)^2.\n\nCompute 65^2: 65*65 = 4225\n\nCompute 64^2: 64*64 = 4096\n\nSo, sum is 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication:\n\n(65 +64i)(65 -64i) = 65^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - 4096*(-1) = 4225 +4096=8321. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Now, the question is to find the remainder when this is divided by 1000. So, compute 8321 mod 1000.\n\nDivide 8321 by 1000: 1000*8=8000, so 8321-8000=321. So the remainder is 321.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 321.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let's try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy the equation \u03c9^n = 1, where n is the order. In this case, \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, so \u03c9^13 = 1, and none of the lower exponents will give 1 except for \u03c9^0 = 1.\n\nThe product is from k=0 to 12, which covers all the 13th roots of unity. Each term in the product is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. I wonder if there's a way to simplify this expression or find a pattern.\n\nLet me write the term as 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Maybe factor something out? Let's see:\n\n2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2.\n\nHmm, that looks a bit like a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me denote x = \u03c9^k. Then the term becomes x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. So each term is a quadratic in x, where x is a 13th root of unity.\n\nSo the entire product is the product from k=0 to 12 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2), where x = \u03c9^k. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, as k goes from 0 to 12, x takes on all 13th roots of unity, including 1 when k=0.\n\nWait, but when k=0, x=\u03c9^0=1. So the term becomes 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So the first term is 1, and the rest are the other roots.\n\nSo the product is 1 * product from k=1 to 12 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). Now, perhaps I can relate this product to a polynomial whose roots are these x's.\n\nSince x are the 13th roots of unity, except x=1, they satisfy x^13 = 1. So, the minimal polynomial for x is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if that's directly helpful. Alternatively, the product over (x - a_k) for all roots a_k of a polynomial is the polynomial itself, up to a constant factor. So, if I can find a polynomial whose roots are x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, then the product would be related to that.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think differently. Since each x is a root of x^13 = 1, except x=1, perhaps I can express x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 in terms of x^13 - 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the product as evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points.\n\nWait, another thought: For each x \u2260 1, x is a root of \u03a6_13(x) = 0. So, perhaps if I can write the product as \u03a6_13 evaluated at something.\n\nWait, but each term is a quadratic in x. Maybe I can consider the product over (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) as the product over (x - \u03b1)(x - \u03b2), where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are roots of the quadratic equation x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0.\n\nLet me compute the roots of x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, x = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 2i] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, \u03b1 = 1 + i and \u03b2 = 1 - i.\n\nTherefore, each term (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nSo the product from k=0 to 12 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product from k=0 to 12 of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nBut x here is \u03c9^k, so each term becomes (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo the entire product is the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nBut wait, the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - a) is equal to the product over all 13th roots of unity of (x - a). I remember that the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1, because the roots of x^13 - 1 are exactly the 13th roots of unity.\n\nBut in our case, we have a product of (\u03c9^k - a) for each k. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, if I take the product from k=0 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1. So, if I set x = a, then the product from k=0 to 12 of (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1. So the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 (a^13 - 1) = -(a^13 - 1) = 1 - a^13.\n\nSo in our case, the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = 1 - (1 + i)^13.\n\nSimilarly, the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = 1 - (1 - i)^13.\n\nTherefore, the original product is [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13].\n\nSo now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract each from 1, and then multiply the two results together.\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^13 first. I know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -\u03c0/4, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the angles. For (1 + i)^13, the exponent is 13 * \u03c0/4. Let's reduce this modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = (12 + 1) * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0 (because 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0), so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, for (1 - i)^13, the angle is -13\u03c0/4. Let's compute that:\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = -(12\u03c0/4 + \u03c0/4) = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 to make it positive: -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = \u03c0 - \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Alternatively, -13\u03c0/4 can be written as - (13/4)\u03c0. Let's add 2\u03c0 multiple times until it's within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n13/4 = 3.25. So, 13/4 \u03c0 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. To get the positive angle, we can subtract 2\u03c0 once: 13/4 \u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = 13/4 \u03c0 - 8/4 \u03c0 = 5/4 \u03c0. So, the angle is 5\u03c0/4. Wait, but for (1 - i), the angle is negative, so perhaps I should think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)}. Since e^{-i*3\u03c0} = e^{-i\u03c0} because 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0). So, e^{-i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i\u03c0} * e^{-i\u03c0/4} = (-1) * (cos(\u03c0/4) - i sin(\u03c0/4)) = (-1) * (\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2) = -\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since (1 + i) and (1 - i) are conjugates, their powers will also be conjugates. So, (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 are complex conjugates.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = a + bi, and (1 - i)^13 = a - bi.\n\nSo, [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13] = [1 - (a + bi)] [1 - (a - bi)] = (1 - a - bi)(1 - a + bi).\n\nMultiplying these two terms: (1 - a)^2 - (bi)^2 = (1 - 2a + a\u00b2) - (b\u00b2 i\u00b2) = (1 - 2a + a\u00b2) + b\u00b2, since i\u00b2 = -1.\n\nSo, it's equal to (1 - 2a + a\u00b2 + b\u00b2).\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, I can compute each term separately.\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^13:\n\n(1 + i)^1 = 1 + i\n(1 + i)^2 = (1 + i)(1 + i) = 1 + 2i + i\u00b2 = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i\n(1 + i)^3 = (1 + i)^2 (1 + i) = (2i)(1 + i) = 2i + 2i\u00b2 = 2i - 2 = -2 + 2i\n(1 + i)^4 = (1 + i)^2 * (1 + i)^2 = (2i)(2i) = 4i\u00b2 = -4\n(1 + i)^5 = (1 + i)^4 * (1 + i) = (-4)(1 + i) = -4 -4i\n(1 + i)^6 = (1 + i)^5 * (1 + i) = (-4 -4i)(1 + i) = -4(1 + i) -4i(1 + i) = -4 -4i -4i -4i\u00b2 = -4 -8i +4 = 0 -8i = -8i\n(1 + i)^7 = (1 + i)^6 * (1 + i) = (-8i)(1 + i) = -8i -8i\u00b2 = -8i +8 = 8 -8i\n(1 + i)^8 = (1 + i)^4 * (1 + i)^4 = (-4)(-4) = 16\n(1 + i)^9 = (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i) = 16(1 + i) = 16 +16i\n(1 + i)^10 = (1 + i)^9 * (1 + i) = (16 +16i)(1 + i) = 16(1 + i) +16i(1 + i) = 16 +16i +16i +16i\u00b2 = 16 +32i -16 = 0 +32i =32i\n(1 + i)^11 = (1 + i)^10 * (1 + i) = (32i)(1 + i) =32i +32i\u00b2=32i -32= -32 +32i\n(1 + i)^12 = (1 + i)^11 * (1 + i) = (-32 +32i)(1 + i)= -32(1 + i) +32i(1 +i)= -32 -32i +32i +32i\u00b2= -32 +0i -32= -64\n(1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^12 * (1 + i) = (-64)(1 + i)= -64 -64i\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13: Since (1 - i) is the conjugate of (1 + i), so (1 - i)^13 will be the conjugate of (1 + i)^13. So (1 - i)^13 = (-64 +64i).\n\nWait, let me check that. Let me compute (1 - i)^13 using the same method.\n\n(1 - i)^1 = 1 -i\n(1 - i)^2 = (1 - i)(1 - i)=1 -2i +i\u00b2=1 -2i -1= -2i\n(1 - i)^3 = (1 -i)^2 (1 -i)= (-2i)(1 -i)= -2i +2i\u00b2= -2i -2= -2 -2i\n(1 -i)^4 = (1 -i)^2 * (1 -i)^2= (-2i)(-2i)=4i\u00b2= -4\n(1 -i)^5 = (1 -i)^4 (1 -i)= (-4)(1 -i)= -4 +4i\n(1 -i)^6 = (1 -i)^5 (1 -i)= (-4 +4i)(1 -i)= -4(1 -i) +4i(1 -i)= -4 +4i +4i -4i\u00b2= -4 +8i +4= 0 +8i=8i\n(1 -i)^7 = (1 -i)^6 (1 -i)= (8i)(1 -i)=8i -8i\u00b2=8i +8=8 +8i\n(1 -i)^8 = (1 -i)^4 * (1 -i)^4= (-4)(-4)=16\n(1 -i)^9 = (1 -i)^8 (1 -i)=16(1 -i)=16 -16i\n(1 -i)^10 = (1 -i)^9 (1 -i)= (16 -16i)(1 -i)=16(1 -i) -16i(1 -i)=16 -16i -16i +16i\u00b2=16 -32i -16=0 -32i= -32i\n(1 -i)^11 = (1 -i)^10 (1 -i)= (-32i)(1 -i)= -32i +32i\u00b2= -32i -32= -32 -32i\n(1 -i)^12 = (1 -i)^11 (1 -i)= (-32 -32i)(1 -i)= -32(1 -i) -32i(1 -i)= -32 +32i -32i +32i\u00b2= -32 +0i -32= -64\n(1 -i)^13 = (1 -i)^12 (1 -i)= (-64)(1 -i)= -64 +64i\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i, and (1 -i)^13 = -64 +64i.\n\nSo, going back, the product [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 -i)^13] becomes [1 - (-64 -64i)] * [1 - (-64 +64i)].\n\nSimplify each bracket:\n\nFirst bracket: 1 - (-64 -64i) = 1 +64 +64i =65 +64i\n\nSecond bracket:1 - (-64 +64i) =1 +64 -64i=65 -64i\n\nNow, multiply these two complex numbers: (65 +64i)(65 -64i). This is a product of conjugates, so it's equal to (65)^2 + (64)^2.\n\nCompute 65^2: 65*65 = 4225\n\nCompute 64^2: 64*64 = 4096\n\nSo, sum is 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication:\n\n(65 +64i)(65 -64i) = 65^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - 4096*(-1) = 4225 +4096=8321. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Now, the question is to find the remainder when this is divided by 1000. So, compute 8321 mod 1000.\n\nDivide 8321 by 1000: 1000*8=8000, so 8321-8000=321. So the remainder is 321.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 321.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) is a 13th root of unity.\n\nFirst, we rewrite each term in the product as \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\), where \\(x = \\omega^k\\). Recognizing that \\(x\\) are the 13th roots of unity, the product becomes \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2)\\). This can be factored as \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i))\\).\n\nUsing the property that the product of \\((x - \\omega^k)\\) for all 13th roots of unity \\(\\omega^k\\) is \\(x^{13} - 1\\), we substitute \\(x = 1 + i\\) and \\(x = 1 - i\\). Thus, the product becomes \\([1 - (1 + i)^{13}][1 - (1 - i)^{13}]\\).\n\nCalculating \\((1 + i)^{13}\\) and \\((1 - i)^{13}\\) using polar forms and De Moivre's theorem, we find \\((1 + i)^{13} = -64 - 64i\\) and \\((1 - i)^{13} = -64 + 64i\\). Substituting these into the product gives \\([1 - (-64 - 64i)][1 - (-64 + 64i)] = (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i)\\).\n\nMultiplying these conjugates yields \\(65^2 + 64^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321\\). Finally, finding the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 gives \\(321\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{321}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and \u03c9 \u2260 1. Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that the 13th roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^13 = 1. So, \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k for k = 0,1,2,...,12 are all distinct. Since \u03c9 \u2260 1, we're dealing with the primitive roots here.\n\nLooking at the product, it's from k=0 to 12, so that's all the 13th roots. The term inside the product is (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). I wonder if I can rewrite this in a more manageable form.\n\nLet me factor out a 2 from the first two terms: 2(1 - \u03c9^k) + \u03c9^{2k}. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can factor the expression differently. Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as a quadratic in \u03c9^k.\n\nLet me think: Let z = \u03c9^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2z + z\u00b2. So, 2 - 2z + z\u00b2. Maybe I can factor this quadratic or relate it to some known polynomial.\n\nWait, 2 - 2z + z\u00b2 can be rewritten as z\u00b2 - 2z + 2. Let me see if this factors. The discriminant is (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So, the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, the quadratic factors as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). So, 2 - 2z + z\u00b2 = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).\n\nThat's interesting. So, each term in the product can be written as (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product becomes the product over k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich can be written as the product of two separate products: [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nSo, I have to compute the product of (\u03c9^k - a) for all k, where a is (1 + i) and then a is (1 - i). Hmm, I remember that for roots of unity, the product over all (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is equal to x^13 - 1, because the minimal polynomial is the cyclotomic polynomial, but wait, actually, x^13 -1 factors as (x - 1)(x - \u03c9)(x - \u03c9^2)...(x - \u03c9^{12}).\n\nSo, the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1. So, in my case, for the first product, x is (1 + i). So, the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ((1 + i) - \u03c9^k) = (1 + i)^13 - 1.\n\nSimilarly, the second product is \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ((1 - i) - \u03c9^k) = (1 - i)^13 - 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original product is [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1].\n\nNow, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Hmm, perhaps I can write 1 + i and 1 - i in polar form to compute their powers more easily.\n\nLet me recall that 1 + i has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has the same magnitude, sqrt(2), but an angle of -\u03c0/4. So, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute [sqrt(2)]^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, for the exponential terms:\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, let me subtract 2\u03c0 to bring it within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, -13\u03c0/4: Let's compute that. Since angles are periodic with 2\u03c0, let's add multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's positive.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = (-13\u03c0/4) + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4} and e^{-i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i3\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{i5\u03c0/4} = 64*sqrt(2) * [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{i3\u03c0/4} = 64*sqrt(2) * [cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4)].\n\nLet me compute these trigonometric parts.\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\ncos(3\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i).\n\nCompute sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2, so 64 * 2 * (-1/2)(1 + i) = 64*(-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i).\n\nAgain, sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2, so 64 * 2 * (-1/2)(1 - i) = 64*(-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i).\n\nSo, now, the two terms are:\n\n(1 + i)^13 - 1 = (-64(1 + i)) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 = (-64(1 - i)) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product is (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i). Hmm, this looks like the product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is |z|^2.\n\nIndeed, (a - bi)(a + bi) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2.\n\nSo, let me compute (-65)^2 + (64)^2.\n\n(-65)^2 = 4225.\n\n64^2 = 4096.\n\nSo, 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but wait a second. I thought the product was [(1 + i)^13 -1] * [(1 - i)^13 -1] which is (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i) = 8321.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13: I computed it as -64(1 + i). Let me verify that.\n\n1 + i is sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}. So, (sqrt(2))^13 is 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2). Then, (e^{i\u03c0/4})^13 = e^{i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1) = -e^{i\u03c0/4} = -(sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * [ (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 * (-1 - i) ] = 64 * [ (2)/2 * (-1 - i) ] = 64*(-1 - i) = -64(1 + i). That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13: 1 - i is sqrt(2) e^{-i\u03c0/4}. So, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64*sqrt(2). (e^{-i\u03c0/4})^13 = e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * e^{-i3\u03c0} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * (-1) = -e^{-i\u03c0/4} = - (sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * [ (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 * (-1 + i) ] = 64 * [ (2)/2 * (-1 + i) ] = 64*(-1 + i) = -64(1 - i). Correct.\n\nSo, [(1 + i)^13 - 1] = (-64(1 + i) ) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, [(1 - i)^13 -1] = (-64(1 - i)) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nMultiplying these together: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Now, we need to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000.\n\nWell, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. Because 8*1000 = 8000, and 8321 - 8000 = 321.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes earlier. Because 8321 seems a bit low. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when I calculated (1 + i)^13, I thought it was -64(1 + i), but let me double-check that.\n\nWait, (1 + i)^2 = 2i. Then, (1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4. (1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16. (1 + i)^12 = (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i)^4 = 16*(-4) = -64. Then, (1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^12 * (1 + i) = (-64)(1 + i). That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13: (1 - i)^2 = -2i. (1 - i)^4 = (-2i)^2 = -4. (1 - i)^8 = 16. (1 - i)^12 = 16*(-4) = -64. Then, (1 - i)^13 = (1 - i)^12 * (1 - i) = (-64)(1 - i). Correct.\n\nSo, the computations look correct.\n\nSo, the product is indeed 8321. 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but 8321 / 1000 is 8 with remainder 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, hold on, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 * 1000 = 8000, subtract that from 8321: 8321 - 8000 = 321. Yep.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the product. So, the product is (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) for k from 0 to 12. But when k=0, \u03c9^0 =1. So, the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 -2 +1 =1. So, the first term is 1. So, the product is 1 multiplied by the other terms. Hmm, but in our calculation, we included k=0 in the product, so when k=0, (2 - 2\u03c9^0 + \u03c9^{0}) = 1, which is correct.\n\nBut in our approach, we considered the product as [\u220f (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [\u220f (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))]. For k=0, \u03c9^0 =1, so the term is (1 - (1 + i)) = (-i) and (1 - (1 - i)) = i. So, their product is (-i)(i) = -i^2 = 1, which is correct. So, that term contributes 1, as it should.\n\nSo, all the steps seem correct.\n\nThus, the answer is 321.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and \u03c9 \u2260 1. Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that the 13th roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^13 = 1. So, \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k for k = 0,1,2,...,12 are all distinct. Since \u03c9 \u2260 1, we're dealing with the primitive roots here.\n\nLooking at the product, it's from k=0 to 12, so that's all the 13th roots. The term inside the product is (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). I wonder if I can rewrite this in a more manageable form.\n\nLet me factor out a 2 from the first two terms: 2(1 - \u03c9^k) + \u03c9^{2k}. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can factor the expression differently. Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as a quadratic in \u03c9^k.\n\nLet me think: Let z = \u03c9^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2z + z\u00b2. So, 2 - 2z + z\u00b2. Maybe I can factor this quadratic or relate it to some known polynomial.\n\nWait, 2 - 2z + z\u00b2 can be rewritten as z\u00b2 - 2z + 2. Let me see if this factors. The discriminant is (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So, the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, the quadratic factors as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). So, 2 - 2z + z\u00b2 = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).\n\nThat's interesting. So, each term in the product can be written as (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product becomes the product over k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich can be written as the product of two separate products: [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nSo, I have to compute the product of (\u03c9^k - a) for all k, where a is (1 + i) and then a is (1 - i). Hmm, I remember that for roots of unity, the product over all (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is equal to x^13 - 1, because the minimal polynomial is the cyclotomic polynomial, but wait, actually, x^13 -1 factors as (x - 1)(x - \u03c9)(x - \u03c9^2)...(x - \u03c9^{12}).\n\nSo, the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1. So, in my case, for the first product, x is (1 + i). So, the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ((1 + i) - \u03c9^k) = (1 + i)^13 - 1.\n\nSimilarly, the second product is \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ((1 - i) - \u03c9^k) = (1 - i)^13 - 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original product is [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1].\n\nNow, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Hmm, perhaps I can write 1 + i and 1 - i in polar form to compute their powers more easily.\n\nLet me recall that 1 + i has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has the same magnitude, sqrt(2), but an angle of -\u03c0/4. So, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute [sqrt(2)]^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, for the exponential terms:\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, let me subtract 2\u03c0 to bring it within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, -13\u03c0/4: Let's compute that. Since angles are periodic with 2\u03c0, let's add multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's positive.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = (-13\u03c0/4) + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4} and e^{-i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i3\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{i5\u03c0/4} = 64*sqrt(2) * [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{i3\u03c0/4} = 64*sqrt(2) * [cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4)].\n\nLet me compute these trigonometric parts.\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\ncos(3\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i).\n\nCompute sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2, so 64 * 2 * (-1/2)(1 + i) = 64*(-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i).\n\nAgain, sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2, so 64 * 2 * (-1/2)(1 - i) = 64*(-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i).\n\nSo, now, the two terms are:\n\n(1 + i)^13 - 1 = (-64(1 + i)) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 = (-64(1 - i)) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product is (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i). Hmm, this looks like the product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is |z|^2.\n\nIndeed, (a - bi)(a + bi) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2.\n\nSo, let me compute (-65)^2 + (64)^2.\n\n(-65)^2 = 4225.\n\n64^2 = 4096.\n\nSo, 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but wait a second. I thought the product was [(1 + i)^13 -1] * [(1 - i)^13 -1] which is (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i) = 8321.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13: I computed it as -64(1 + i). Let me verify that.\n\n1 + i is sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}. So, (sqrt(2))^13 is 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2). Then, (e^{i\u03c0/4})^13 = e^{i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1) = -e^{i\u03c0/4} = -(sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * [ (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 * (-1 - i) ] = 64 * [ (2)/2 * (-1 - i) ] = 64*(-1 - i) = -64(1 + i). That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13: 1 - i is sqrt(2) e^{-i\u03c0/4}. So, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64*sqrt(2). (e^{-i\u03c0/4})^13 = e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * e^{-i3\u03c0} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * (-1) = -e^{-i\u03c0/4} = - (sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * [ (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 * (-1 + i) ] = 64 * [ (2)/2 * (-1 + i) ] = 64*(-1 + i) = -64(1 - i). Correct.\n\nSo, [(1 + i)^13 - 1] = (-64(1 + i) ) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, [(1 - i)^13 -1] = (-64(1 - i)) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nMultiplying these together: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Now, we need to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000.\n\nWell, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. Because 8*1000 = 8000, and 8321 - 8000 = 321.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes earlier. Because 8321 seems a bit low. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when I calculated (1 + i)^13, I thought it was -64(1 + i), but let me double-check that.\n\nWait, (1 + i)^2 = 2i. Then, (1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4. (1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16. (1 + i)^12 = (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i)^4 = 16*(-4) = -64. Then, (1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^12 * (1 + i) = (-64)(1 + i). That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13: (1 - i)^2 = -2i. (1 - i)^4 = (-2i)^2 = -4. (1 - i)^8 = 16. (1 - i)^12 = 16*(-4) = -64. Then, (1 - i)^13 = (1 - i)^12 * (1 - i) = (-64)(1 - i). Correct.\n\nSo, the computations look correct.\n\nSo, the product is indeed 8321. 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but 8321 / 1000 is 8 with remainder 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, hold on, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 * 1000 = 8000, subtract that from 8321: 8321 - 8000 = 321. Yep.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the product. So, the product is (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) for k from 0 to 12. But when k=0, \u03c9^0 =1. So, the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 -2 +1 =1. So, the first term is 1. So, the product is 1 multiplied by the other terms. Hmm, but in our calculation, we included k=0 in the product, so when k=0, (2 - 2\u03c9^0 + \u03c9^{0}) = 1, which is correct.\n\nBut in our approach, we considered the product as [\u220f (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [\u220f (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))]. For k=0, \u03c9^0 =1, so the term is (1 - (1 + i)) = (-i) and (1 - (1 - i)) = i. So, their product is (-i)(i) = -i^2 = 1, which is correct. So, that term contributes 1, as it should.\n\nSo, all the steps seem correct.\n\nThus, the answer is 321.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity. We rewrite each term in the product as a quadratic in \u03c9^k:\n\n\\[ 2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k} = (\\omega^k - (1 + i))(\\omega^k - (1 - i)). \\]\n\nThus, the entire product becomes:\n\n\\[ \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 + i)) \\cdot \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 - i)). \\]\n\nUsing the fact that the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for all 13th roots of unity is x^13 - 1, we substitute x with (1 + i) and (1 - i):\n\n\\[ \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 + i - \\omega^k) = (1 + i)^{13} - 1, \\]\n\\[ \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - i - \\omega^k) = (1 - i)^{13} - 1. \\]\n\nNext, we compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Expressing 1 + i and 1 - i in polar form:\n\n\\[ 1 + i = \\sqrt{2} e^{i\\pi/4}, \\quad 1 - i = \\sqrt{2} e^{-i\\pi/4}. \\]\n\nRaising these to the 13th power:\n\n\\[ (1 + i)^{13} = ( \\sqrt{2} )^{13} e^{i \\cdot 13 \\cdot \\pi/4} = 64\\sqrt{2} \\cdot e^{i5\\pi/4} = -64(1 + i), \\]\n\\[ (1 - i)^{13} = ( \\sqrt{2} )^{13} e^{-i \\cdot 13 \\cdot \\pi/4} = 64\\sqrt{2} \\cdot e^{-i5\\pi/4} = -64(1 - i). \\]\n\nSubtracting 1 from each:\n\n\\[ (1 + i)^{13} - 1 = -65 - 64i, \\]\n\\[ (1 - i)^{13} - 1 = -65 + 64i. \\]\n\nMultiplying these results:\n\n\\[ (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. \\]\n\nFinally, we find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000:\n\n\\[ 8321 \\mod 1000 = 321. \\]\n\nThe remainder is \\(\\boxed{321}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, not equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation \u03c9^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial over the rationals is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure yet how that helps me here.\n\nThe expression I have is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me denote each term as P(k) = 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. So, the product is P(0) * P(1) * ... * P(12). Since \u03c9^13 = 1, each \u03c9^k cycles through all the 13th roots of unity as k goes from 0 to 12.\n\nWait, but \u03c9 is a primitive root, so the exponents cycle modulo 13. That might be useful. Also, since we're dealing with a product over all roots, perhaps there's a way to relate this product to the roots of some polynomial.\n\nLet me think about evaluating a polynomial at certain points. If I can write this product as evaluating a polynomial at \u03c9^k for each k, then maybe I can use properties of polynomials to find the product.\n\nLooking at each term P(k) = 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me write it as P(k) = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. So, for each k, P(k) is a quadratic expression in \u03c9^k.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor this quadratic. Let me try:\n\nP(k) = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. Let me treat \u03c9^k as a variable, say z. Then P(k) becomes z\u00b2 - 2z + 2.\n\nI can try to factor this quadratic: z\u00b2 - 2z + 2. Let's compute the discriminant: D = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i. Therefore, z\u00b2 - 2z + 2 = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). So, P(k) = (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, the product over k=0 to 12 of P(k) is the product over k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). Hmm, so this is the same as [product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] multiplied by [product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nNow, I remember that the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is equal to x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1, because the roots of x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1 are exactly the 13th roots of unity. So, for a general x, product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1.\n\nBut in our case, we have product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a), where a is a constant. Let me see: if I let x = a in the above formula, then product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1. Therefore, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = - (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1) = 1 - a\u00b9\u00b3.\n\nWait, because product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) * (-1). So, if product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1, then product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^{13} (a\u00b9\u00b3 -1 ) = - (a\u00b9\u00b3 -1 ) = 1 - a\u00b9\u00b3.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, applying this, the product over k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) is equal to 1 - (1 + i)^13, and similarly for (1 - i).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original product is [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13].\n\nSo, now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract each from 1, and then multiply the two results.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^{13} first. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponents: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let me compute 13 * \u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0 to find the equivalent angle. 13 divided by 8 is 1 with remainder 5, so 13 * \u03c0/4 = (8 + 5) * \u03c0/4 = 2\u03c0 + (5\u03c0/4). So, 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant.\n\nSimilarly, for the negative exponent: -13\u03c0/4 is the same as -5\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 * 2 = 3\u03c0/4 (since -5\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = 3\u03c0/4). Wait, maybe I should compute it as:\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = - (12\u03c0/4 + \u03c0/4) = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4 = but adding multiples of 2\u03c0: -3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 (since -3\u03c0 + 2\u03c0 = -\u03c0, which is equivalent to \u03c0). Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 divided by 2\u03c0 is (13/4)/(2) = 13/8 = 1.625. So, subtract 2\u03c0 once: 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify that: cos(5\u03c0/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) is -sqrt(2)/2. So, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2). So, (1 + i)^13 is 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n64 sqrt(2) multiplied by (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) equals:\n\nFirst, sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) is - (2)/2 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) is -i (2)/2 = -i.\n\nSo, each term is multiplied by 64: 64*(-1) = -64, and 64*(-i) = -64i. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is 64 sqrt(2) multiplied by e^{-i5\u03c0/4} which is (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nAgain, sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -1, and sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = i.\n\nSo, 64*(-1) = -64, and 64*i = 64i. So, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, now I can compute 1 - (1 + i)^13 = 1 - (-64 -64i) = 1 + 64 + 64i = 65 + 64i.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - (1 - i)^13 = 1 - (-64 + 64i) = 1 + 64 - 64i = 65 - 64i.\n\nSo, the original product is (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i). Let me compute this.\n\n(65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65\u00b2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * i\u00b2) = 4225 - (4096 * (-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, so the product is 8321. Now, I need to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000.\n\nDividing 8321 by 1000: 1000 * 8 = 8000. 8321 - 8000 = 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check all the steps because it's easy to make a mistake with the exponents and signs.\n\nFirst, the expression P(k) = 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} was rewritten as \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2, which factors into (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). That seems correct.\n\nThen, the product over k=0 to 12 becomes [product (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [product (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))], which equals [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13]. That step uses the fact that product (\u03c9^k - a) = 1 - a^13, which I think is correct because product (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1, so setting x = a gives product (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1, and thus product (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 (a^13 - 1) = 1 - a^13. Yes, that's right.\n\nThen, computing (1 + i)^13: as (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13\u03c0/4} = 2^(13/2) e^{i(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = 2^(6.5) e^{i(13\u03c0/4)}. Wait, actually, 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4 when considering modulo 2\u03c0. Wait, no: 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is more than 2\u03c0. Let me compute 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, yes, e^{i13\u03c0/4} is e^{i5\u03c0/4} which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is e^{-i13\u03c0/4} which is e^{-i5\u03c0/4}.\n\nCalculating (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/2)^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying 64 sqrt(2) with e^{i5\u03c0/4} gives 64 sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ] = 64 * [ (-1) - i ] = -64 -64i. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for (1 - i)^13, we get -64 +64i. Then, 1 - (1 + i)^13 is 1 - (-64 -64i) = 65 +64i, and 1 - (1 - i)^13 is 65 -64i. Then, multiplying those gives (65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Correct.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with remainder 321. So, the remainder is 321. Therefore, the answer should be 321.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute (65 +64i)(65 -64i) again.\n\nFirst, 65*65 = 4225.\n\nThen, 65*(-64i) = -4160i.\n\nThen, 64i*65 = 4160i.\n\nThen, 64i*(-64i) = -4096 i\u00b2 = 4096 since i\u00b2 is -1.\n\nSo, adding all terms: 4225 -4160i +4160i +4096 = 4225 +4096 = 8321. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321 when 8321 is divided by 1000. So, the final answer is 321.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, not equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation \u03c9^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial over the rationals is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure yet how that helps me here.\n\nThe expression I have is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me denote each term as P(k) = 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. So, the product is P(0) * P(1) * ... * P(12). Since \u03c9^13 = 1, each \u03c9^k cycles through all the 13th roots of unity as k goes from 0 to 12.\n\nWait, but \u03c9 is a primitive root, so the exponents cycle modulo 13. That might be useful. Also, since we're dealing with a product over all roots, perhaps there's a way to relate this product to the roots of some polynomial.\n\nLet me think about evaluating a polynomial at certain points. If I can write this product as evaluating a polynomial at \u03c9^k for each k, then maybe I can use properties of polynomials to find the product.\n\nLooking at each term P(k) = 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me write it as P(k) = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. So, for each k, P(k) is a quadratic expression in \u03c9^k.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor this quadratic. Let me try:\n\nP(k) = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. Let me treat \u03c9^k as a variable, say z. Then P(k) becomes z\u00b2 - 2z + 2.\n\nI can try to factor this quadratic: z\u00b2 - 2z + 2. Let's compute the discriminant: D = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i. Therefore, z\u00b2 - 2z + 2 = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). So, P(k) = (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, the product over k=0 to 12 of P(k) is the product over k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). Hmm, so this is the same as [product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] multiplied by [product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nNow, I remember that the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is equal to x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1, because the roots of x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1 are exactly the 13th roots of unity. So, for a general x, product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1.\n\nBut in our case, we have product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a), where a is a constant. Let me see: if I let x = a in the above formula, then product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1. Therefore, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = - (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1) = 1 - a\u00b9\u00b3.\n\nWait, because product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) * (-1). So, if product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1, then product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^{13} (a\u00b9\u00b3 -1 ) = - (a\u00b9\u00b3 -1 ) = 1 - a\u00b9\u00b3.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, applying this, the product over k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) is equal to 1 - (1 + i)^13, and similarly for (1 - i).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original product is [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13].\n\nSo, now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract each from 1, and then multiply the two results.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^{13} first. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponents: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let me compute 13 * \u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0 to find the equivalent angle. 13 divided by 8 is 1 with remainder 5, so 13 * \u03c0/4 = (8 + 5) * \u03c0/4 = 2\u03c0 + (5\u03c0/4). So, 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant.\n\nSimilarly, for the negative exponent: -13\u03c0/4 is the same as -5\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 * 2 = 3\u03c0/4 (since -5\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = 3\u03c0/4). Wait, maybe I should compute it as:\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = - (12\u03c0/4 + \u03c0/4) = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4 = but adding multiples of 2\u03c0: -3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 (since -3\u03c0 + 2\u03c0 = -\u03c0, which is equivalent to \u03c0). Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 divided by 2\u03c0 is (13/4)/(2) = 13/8 = 1.625. So, subtract 2\u03c0 once: 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify that: cos(5\u03c0/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) is -sqrt(2)/2. So, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2). So, (1 + i)^13 is 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n64 sqrt(2) multiplied by (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) equals:\n\nFirst, sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) is - (2)/2 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) is -i (2)/2 = -i.\n\nSo, each term is multiplied by 64: 64*(-1) = -64, and 64*(-i) = -64i. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is 64 sqrt(2) multiplied by e^{-i5\u03c0/4} which is (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nAgain, sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -1, and sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = i.\n\nSo, 64*(-1) = -64, and 64*i = 64i. So, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, now I can compute 1 - (1 + i)^13 = 1 - (-64 -64i) = 1 + 64 + 64i = 65 + 64i.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - (1 - i)^13 = 1 - (-64 + 64i) = 1 + 64 - 64i = 65 - 64i.\n\nSo, the original product is (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i). Let me compute this.\n\n(65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65\u00b2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * i\u00b2) = 4225 - (4096 * (-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, so the product is 8321. Now, I need to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000.\n\nDividing 8321 by 1000: 1000 * 8 = 8000. 8321 - 8000 = 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check all the steps because it's easy to make a mistake with the exponents and signs.\n\nFirst, the expression P(k) = 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} was rewritten as \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2, which factors into (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). That seems correct.\n\nThen, the product over k=0 to 12 becomes [product (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [product (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))], which equals [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13]. That step uses the fact that product (\u03c9^k - a) = 1 - a^13, which I think is correct because product (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1, so setting x = a gives product (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1, and thus product (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 (a^13 - 1) = 1 - a^13. Yes, that's right.\n\nThen, computing (1 + i)^13: as (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13\u03c0/4} = 2^(13/2) e^{i(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = 2^(6.5) e^{i(13\u03c0/4)}. Wait, actually, 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4 when considering modulo 2\u03c0. Wait, no: 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is more than 2\u03c0. Let me compute 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, yes, e^{i13\u03c0/4} is e^{i5\u03c0/4} which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is e^{-i13\u03c0/4} which is e^{-i5\u03c0/4}.\n\nCalculating (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/2)^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying 64 sqrt(2) with e^{i5\u03c0/4} gives 64 sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ] = 64 * [ (-1) - i ] = -64 -64i. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for (1 - i)^13, we get -64 +64i. Then, 1 - (1 + i)^13 is 1 - (-64 -64i) = 65 +64i, and 1 - (1 - i)^13 is 65 -64i. Then, multiplying those gives (65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Correct.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with remainder 321. So, the remainder is 321. Therefore, the answer should be 321.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute (65 +64i)(65 -64i) again.\n\nFirst, 65*65 = 4225.\n\nThen, 65*(-64i) = -4160i.\n\nThen, 64i*65 = 4160i.\n\nThen, 64i*(-64i) = -4096 i\u00b2 = 4096 since i\u00b2 is -1.\n\nSo, adding all terms: 4225 -4160i +4160i +4096 = 4225 +4096 = 8321. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321 when 8321 is divided by 1000. So, the final answer is 321.\n\n\nThe problem requires finding the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive 13th root of unity.\n\nFirst, each term in the product is rewritten as \\(P(k) = \\omega^{2k} - 2\\omega^k + 2\\), which factors into \\((\\omega^k - (1 + i))(\\omega^k - (1 - i))\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when dealing with products. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, that means \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k for k=0 to 12 are all distinct. So, maybe I can use some cyclotomic polynomial properties here.\n\nLooking at the expression inside the product: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor it or rewrite it in a more manageable form.\n\nLet me try to factor it. Let's see, 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} can be rewritten as \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. Wait, is that a quadratic in terms of \u03c9^k? Let me think: Let x = \u03c9^k, then the expression becomes x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. So, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Can I factor this quadratic?\n\nCalculating the discriminant: b\u00b2 - 4ac = (-2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So, the roots are complex, given by [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, the quadratic factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nTherefore, 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). So, the original product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nHmm, so I can write this as the product over k of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) multiplied by the product over k of (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). So, two separate products.\n\nWait, but for k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1, so the term becomes (1 - (1 + i))(1 - (1 - i)) = (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So, that's just 1, which doesn't affect the product. So, the product starts from k=1 to 12 instead? Wait, no, the original product is from k=0 to 12, so I need to include k=0. But when k=0, each term is (1 - (1+i))(1 - (1-i)) = (-i)(i) = 1, so the entire product is 1 times the rest. So, maybe it's okay to consider k=0 to 12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the product over all \u03c9^k, including k=0, since \u03c9^0 is 1, and the product will include that term as well.\n\nNow, I recall that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1, but since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, the minimal polynomial is the cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But wait, when x=1, \u03a6_13(1) = 13. So, perhaps I can relate the product to some cyclotomic polynomial.\n\nWait, but in our case, the product is over (\u03c9^k - a) where a is a constant. So, perhaps I can evaluate the product of (x - a) for x = \u03c9^k, which is the same as the product over (\u03c9^k - a). So, for a general a, the product over k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - a) is equal to a^13 - 1, because the product over all roots of unity x of (x - a) is a^n - 1, where n is the order.\n\nWait, yes, because the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to n-1 is x^n - 1. So, substituting x = a, it's a^n - 1. So, in our case, n=13, so product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1.\n\nWait, but in our case, the product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^{13} product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = - (a^13 - 1). Because each term is (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)(a - \u03c9^k), so the product becomes (-1)^13 times the product of (a - \u03c9^k), which is - (a^13 - 1).\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a^13 - 1) = 1 - a^13.\n\nSo, applying this, for a = 1 + i, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = 1 - (1 + i)^13.\n\nSimilarly, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = 1 - (1 - i)^13.\n\nTherefore, the original product is [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13].\n\nSo, now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13.\n\nI know that 1 + i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4. So, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) with angle -\u03c0/4, so (1 - i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{-i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, for n=13:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13*\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13*\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). So, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, compute the angles:\n\n13 * \u03c0 /4 = (12 + 1) * \u03c0 /4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. Since 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 (mod 2\u03c0), because 3\u03c0 = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0. So, e^{i (\u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0)} = e^{i (\u03c0/4 + \u03c0)} = e^{i 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i \u03c0/4 - i 3\u03c0} = e^{-i \u03c0/4 - i \u03c0} = e^{-i 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nBut e^{i 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nMultiply 64 sqrt(2) by (-sqrt(2)/2):\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (2)/2 ) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, 64 sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-i (2)/2 ) = 64 * (-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nCompute that:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64, as before.\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * i (2)/2 = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nNow, let's compute 1 - (1 + i)^13 and 1 - (1 - i)^13.\n\n1 - (1 + i)^13 = 1 - (-64 -64i) = 1 + 64 + 64i = 65 + 64i.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - (1 - i)^13 = 1 - (-64 + 64i) = 1 + 64 - 64i = 65 - 64i.\n\nSo, the original product is (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i).\n\nMultiplying these two complex numbers: (65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 65^2 - (64)^2 (i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication:\n\n(65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65^2 + (64i)(-64i) + 65*(-64i) + 65*64i.\n\nWait, actually, that's not the standard way. The standard way is (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2. So, here a=65, b=64i. So, (65)^2 - (64i)^2.\n\nWhich is 4225 - (64)^2 (i^2). Since i^2 = -1, so this is 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Now, we need to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000.\n\nDividing 8321 by 1000: 1000 * 8 = 8000, so 8321 - 8000 = 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes earlier. Let me go back and check.\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13: angle was 13 * \u03c0/4. 13/4 is 3.25, which is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so subtract 2\u03c0: 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0, so angle is \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, the magnitude: (sqrt(2))^13 = (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). Correct.\n\nThen, 64 sqrt(2) multiplied by e^{i 5\u03c0/4}.\n\ne^{i 5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2). Correct.\n\nSo, 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = -64. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for the imaginary part: 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i) = -64i. Correct. So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64 +64i. Correct.\n\nThen, 1 - (1 + i)^13 = 1 - (-64 -64i) = 65 +64i. Correct.\n\n1 - (1 - i)^13 = 1 - (-64 +64i) = 65 -64i. Correct.\n\nThen, (65 +64i)(65 -64i) = 65\u00b2 - (64i)\u00b2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 +4096=8321. Correct.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 = 8000, 8321-8000=321. So, remainder is 321. So, 321 is the answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 8321 mod 1000.\n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with remainder 321. Because 1000*8=8000, 8321-8000=321. Yes, so 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, the answer should be 321. So, I think that's the remainder when the product is divided by 1000.\n",

So, the quadratic factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nTherefore, 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).

So, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, compute the angles:\n\n13 * \u03c0 /4 = (12 + 1) * \u03c0 /4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. Since 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 (mod 2\u03c0), because 3\u03c0 = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0. So, e^{i (\u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0)} = e^{i (\u03c0/4 + \u03c0)} = e^{i 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i \u03c0/4 - i 3\u03c0} = e^{-i \u03c0/4 - i \u03c0} = e^{-i 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nBut e^{i 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nMultiply 64 sqrt(2) by (-sqrt(2)/2):\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (2)/2 ) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, 64 sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-i (2)/2 ) = 64 * (-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nCompute that:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64, as before.\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * i (2)/2 = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nNow, let's compute 1 - (1 + i)^13 and 1 - (1 - i)^13.\n\n1 - (1 + i)^13 = 1 - (-64 -64i) = 1 + 64 + 64i = 65 + 64i.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - (1 - i)^13 = 1 - (-64 + 64i) = 1 + 64 - 64i = 65 - 64i.\n\nSo, the original product is (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i).\n\nMultiplying these two complex numbers: (65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 65^2 - (64)^2 (i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication:\n\n(65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65^2 + (64i)(-64i) + 65*(-64i) + 65*64i.\n\nWait, actually, that's not the standard way. The standard way is (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2. So, here a=65, b=64i. So, (65)^2 - (64i)^2.\n\nWhich is 4225 - (64)^2 (i^2). Since i^2 = -1, so this is 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Now, we need to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000.\n\nDividing 8321 by 1000: 1000 * 8 = 8000, so 8321 - 8000 = 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes earlier. Let me go back and check.\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13: angle was 13 * \u03c0/4. 13/4 is 3.25, which is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so subtract 2\u03c0: 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0, so angle is \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, the magnitude: (sqrt(2))^13 = (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). Correct.\n\nThen, 64 sqrt(2) multiplied by e^{i 5\u03c0/4}.\n\ne^{i 5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2). Correct.\n\nSo, 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = -64. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for the imaginary part: 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i) = -64i. Correct. So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64 +64i. Correct.\n\nThen, 1 - (1 + i)^13 = 1 - (-64 -64i) = 65 +64i. Correct.\n\n1 - (1 - i)^13 = 1 - (-64 +64i) = 65 -64i. Correct.\n\nThen, (65 +64i)(65 -64i) = 65\u00b2 - (64i)\u00b2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 +4096=8321. Correct.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 = 8000, 8321-8000=321. So, remainder is 321. So, 321 is the answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 8321 mod 1000.\n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with remainder 321. Because 1000*8=8000, 8321-8000=321. Yes, so 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, the answer should be 321. So, I think that's the remainder when the product is divided by 1000.\n\n\nThe problem requires finding the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) is a 13th root of unity.\n\nFirst, rewrite each term \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\) as a quadratic in \\(\\omega^k\\):\n\\[\n2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k} = \\omega^{2k} - 2\\omega^k + 2 = (\\omega^k - (1 + i))(\\omega^k - (1 - i)).\n\\]\nThus, the product becomes:\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 + i)) \\cdot \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 - i)).\n\\]\n\nUsing the property of roots of unity, the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (a - \\omega^k) = a^{13} - 1\\). Therefore:\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - a) = 1 - a^{13}.\n\\]\nApplying this:\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 + i)) = 1 - (1 + i)^{13}, \\quad \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 - i)) = 1 - (1 - i)^{13}.\n\\]\n\nCompute \\((1 + i)^{13}\\) and \\((1 - i)^{13}\\). Since \\(1 + i\\) has magnitude \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and angle \\(\\pi/4\\), we have:\n\\[\n(1 + i)^{13} = (\\sqrt{2})^{13} e^{i \\cdot 13 \\cdot \\pi/4} = 64\\sqrt{2} \\cdot e^{i \\cdot 5\\pi/4} = -64 - 64i.\n\\]\nSimilarly,\n\\[\n(1 - i)^{13} = 64\\sqrt{2} \\cdot e^{-i \\cdot 5\\pi/4} = -64 + 64i.\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\\[\n1 - (1 + i)^{13} = 1 - (-64 - 64i) = 65 + 64i,\n\\]\n\\[\n1 - (1 - i)^{13} = 1 - (-64 + 64i) = 65 - 64i.\n\\]\n\nThe product is:\n\\[\n(65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\\]\n\nFinally, find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000:\n\\[\n8321 \\mod 1000 = 321.\n\\]\n\nThe remainder is \\(\\boxed{321}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and \u03c9 \u2260 1. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k for k from 0 to 12 are all distinct. Also, the sum of all the roots of unity is zero. That might come in handy later.\n\nThe expression I need to compute is the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me write that down:\n\nP = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\n\nI wonder if I can factor or simplify each term in the product. Let's look at one term: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}.\n\nMaybe I can factor out something. Let's see:\n\n2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2\n\nHmm, that looks like a quadratic in terms of \u03c9^k. Let me set x = \u03c9^k for simplicity. Then the term becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2x + 2\n\nSo each term in the product is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, where x is \u03c9^k. So the entire product is the product over all 13th roots of unity x (except x=1) of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). Wait, but when k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1, so that term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1\u00b2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the k=0 term is 1, so I can ignore it since multiplying by 1 doesn't change the product. So the product simplifies to:\n\nP = \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2)\n\nBut since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, \u03c9^k for k=1 to 12 are all distinct and non-1. So, maybe I can relate this product to some polynomial evaluated at certain points.\n\nI remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product over all roots \u03b1 of f(x) of (x - \u03b1) is f(x). But here, I have a product of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at each \u03c9^k. Wait, perhaps I can consider the product over all x = \u03c9^k (k=1 to 12) of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). So, that would be equivalent to evaluating the product of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) for each x being a 13th root of unity except x=1.\n\nWait, another approach: if I consider the polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1, which factors as (x - 1)(x - \u03c9)(x - \u03c9\u00b2)...(x - \u03c9^{12}). So the product over k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) is (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^{12} + x^{11} + ... + x + 1.\n\nBut in our case, the product is over (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) for x = \u03c9^k, which is similar to evaluating the product of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) over all roots of f(x)=x^13 -1 except x=1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as evaluating another polynomial at specific points. Let me think: the product over x=\u03c9^k (k=1 to 12) of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over x\u22601 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). Which can be written as the product over x\u22601 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) = [product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2)] / (1\u00b2 - 2*1 + 2). Because when x=1, the term is (1 - 2 + 2) = 1, so dividing by that doesn't change the value.\n\nSo, product over x\u22601 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) = [product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2)] / 1 = product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2).\n\nBut the product over all x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is the same as evaluating the polynomial Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 at each root x of f(x) = x^13 - 1, and taking the product.\n\nWait, but I think the product over all roots x of f(x) of Q(x) is equal to the resultant or something, but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I can use logarithms or something else? Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product over all its roots \u03b1 of Q(\u03b1) is equal to the resultant of f and Q, which can be computed as the product of Q(\u03b1) for each root \u03b1 of f.\n\nBut maybe another approach is better. Let me consider that Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Let me see if this can be factored or related to another polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can relate this product to evaluating another polynomial. For example, if I consider that the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is the same as evaluating the value of the polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1 at x being the roots of Q(x) = 0.\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Let me think again. Maybe I can use the concept of polynomials evaluated at multiple points.\n\nWait, another idea: the product over all x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over all x of (x - a)(x - b), where a and b are the roots of Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0. So, the roots are a = [2 + sqrt(4 - 8)]/2 = [2 + sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 + i, and similarly b = 1 - i.\n\nTherefore, Q(x) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, the product over all x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is the product over x of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nBut the product over x of (x - c) where x runs over all 13th roots of unity is f(c) = c^13 - 1. Because f(x) = x^13 - 1, so product over x of (x - c) = c^13 - 1.\n\nWait, but that's the product over all x of (x - c). But in our case, the product is over all x of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, that's equal to [product over x of (x - (1 + i))] * [product over x of (x - (1 - i))].\n\nEach of these products is ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ). So, the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nBut wait, our original product was over x\u22601, but in this case, since x runs over all 13th roots of unity, including x=1, but when x=1, (x - (1 + i)) = (1 - (1 + i)) = -i, and (x - (1 - i)) = -i as well. So, including x=1, the product is as above.\n\nBut earlier, I had that the product over x\u22601 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) divided by (1\u00b2 - 2*1 + 2) = (1 - 2 + 2) = 1. So, the product over x\u22601 is the same as the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). Therefore, the product P is equal to ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nSo, now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract 1 from each, and then multiply them together.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i*(13\u03c0/4)}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i*(13\u03c0/4)}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, e^{i*(13\u03c0/4)}. Let's simplify 13\u03c0/4. Since 13/4 = 3 + 1/4, which is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*1 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i*(13\u03c0/4)} = e^{i*(5\u03c0/4)} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i*(13\u03c0/4)} = e^{-i*(5\u03c0/4)} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) ]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nSo, 64 * (-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) ]\n\nAgain, sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = -1.\n\nSo, 64*(-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i).\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i)\n(1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i)\n\nNow, subtract 1 from each:\n\n(1 + i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i\n\n(1 - i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i\n\nSo, now, the product is (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i). That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is the square of the modulus.\n\nSo, the product is (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n(-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * (-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, P = 8321.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check my steps because 8321 is the product of ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ), which is equal to the product over x\u22601 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). So, P is equal to 8321.\n\nBut wait, the original product was from k=0 to 12, but when k=0, the term was 1, so P is indeed 8321.\n\nWait, but let me check my computations again because 8321 seems a bit high, and I need to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13:\n\nExpressed in polar form: modulus sqrt(2), angle \u03c0/4.\n\nRaising to 13th power: modulus (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nAngle: 13*(\u03c0/4) = 13\u03c0/4. 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is the same as \u03c0/4 beyond 3\u03c0. But since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*1 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) + sqrt(2)*(-i sqrt(2)/2)).\n\nCompute sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2)*(-i sqrt(2)/2) = (-i * 2)/2 = -i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*(-1 - i) = -64(1 + i). That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nWhich gives 64*(-1 + i) = -64(1 - i). Correct.\n\nSubtracting 1:\n\n(1 + i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nMultiplying these two:\n\n(-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Correct.\n\nSo, the product P is 8321.\n\nWait, but the problem says to find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000. The remainder is the last three digits.\n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning.\n\nWait, another thought: when I took the product over x\u22601 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2), I considered it equal to the product over all x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). But is that correct?\n\nBecause when x=1, (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So, the product over all x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over x\u22601 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) multiplied by 1, which is the same as the product over x\u22601. So, yes, my reasoning was correct.\n\nTherefore, P = 8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, the answer should be 321.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and \u03c9 \u2260 1. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k for k from 0 to 12 are all distinct. Also, the sum of all the roots of unity is zero. That might come in handy later.\n\nThe expression I need to compute is the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me write that down:\n\nP = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\n\nI wonder if I can factor or simplify each term in the product. Let's look at one term: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}.\n\nMaybe I can factor out something. Let's see:\n\n2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2\n\nHmm, that looks like a quadratic in terms of \u03c9^k. Let me set x = \u03c9^k for simplicity. Then the term becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2x + 2\n\nSo each term in the product is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, where x is \u03c9^k. So the entire product is the product over all 13th roots of unity x (except x=1) of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). Wait, but when k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1, so that term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1\u00b2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the k=0 term is 1, so I can ignore it since multiplying by 1 doesn't change the product. So the product simplifies to:\n\nP = \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2)\n\nBut since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, \u03c9^k for k=1 to 12 are all distinct and non-1. So, maybe I can relate this product to some polynomial evaluated at certain points.\n\nI remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product over all roots \u03b1 of f(x) of (x - \u03b1) is f(x). But here, I have a product of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at each \u03c9^k. Wait, perhaps I can consider the product over all x = \u03c9^k (k=1 to 12) of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). So, that would be equivalent to evaluating the product of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) for each x being a 13th root of unity except x=1.\n\nWait, another approach: if I consider the polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1, which factors as (x - 1)(x - \u03c9)(x - \u03c9\u00b2)...(x - \u03c9^{12}). So the product over k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) is (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^{12} + x^{11} + ... + x + 1.\n\nBut in our case, the product is over (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) for x = \u03c9^k, which is similar to evaluating the product of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) over all roots of f(x)=x^13 -1 except x=1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as evaluating another polynomial at specific points. Let me think: the product over x=\u03c9^k (k=1 to 12) of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over x\u22601 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). Which can be written as the product over x\u22601 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) = [product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2)] / (1\u00b2 - 2*1 + 2). Because when x=1, the term is (1 - 2 + 2) = 1, so dividing by that doesn't change the value.\n\nSo, product over x\u22601 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) = [product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2)] / 1 = product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2).\n\nBut the product over all x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is the same as evaluating the polynomial Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 at each root x of f(x) = x^13 - 1, and taking the product.\n\nWait, but I think the product over all roots x of f(x) of Q(x) is equal to the resultant or something, but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I can use logarithms or something else? Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product over all its roots \u03b1 of Q(\u03b1) is equal to the resultant of f and Q, which can be computed as the product of Q(\u03b1) for each root \u03b1 of f.\n\nBut maybe another approach is better. Let me consider that Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Let me see if this can be factored or related to another polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can relate this product to evaluating another polynomial. For example, if I consider that the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is the same as evaluating the value of the polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1 at x being the roots of Q(x) = 0.\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Let me think again. Maybe I can use the concept of polynomials evaluated at multiple points.\n\nWait, another idea: the product over all x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over all x of (x - a)(x - b), where a and b are the roots of Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0. So, the roots are a = [2 + sqrt(4 - 8)]/2 = [2 + sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 + i, and similarly b = 1 - i.\n\nTherefore, Q(x) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, the product over all x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is the product over x of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nBut the product over x of (x - c) where x runs over all 13th roots of unity is f(c) = c^13 - 1. Because f(x) = x^13 - 1, so product over x of (x - c) = c^13 - 1.\n\nWait, but that's the product over all x of (x - c). But in our case, the product is over all x of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, that's equal to [product over x of (x - (1 + i))] * [product over x of (x - (1 - i))].\n\nEach of these products is ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ). So, the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nBut wait, our original product was over x\u22601, but in this case, since x runs over all 13th roots of unity, including x=1, but when x=1, (x - (1 + i)) = (1 - (1 + i)) = -i, and (x - (1 - i)) = -i as well. So, including x=1, the product is as above.\n\nBut earlier, I had that the product over x\u22601 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) divided by (1\u00b2 - 2*1 + 2) = (1 - 2 + 2) = 1. So, the product over x\u22601 is the same as the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). Therefore, the product P is equal to ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nSo, now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract 1 from each, and then multiply them together.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i*(13\u03c0/4)}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i*(13\u03c0/4)}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, e^{i*(13\u03c0/4)}. Let's simplify 13\u03c0/4. Since 13/4 = 3 + 1/4, which is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*1 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i*(13\u03c0/4)} = e^{i*(5\u03c0/4)} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i*(13\u03c0/4)} = e^{-i*(5\u03c0/4)} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) ]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nSo, 64 * (-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) ]\n\nAgain, sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = -1.\n\nSo, 64*(-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i).\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i)\n(1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i)\n\nNow, subtract 1 from each:\n\n(1 + i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i\n\n(1 - i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i\n\nSo, now, the product is (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i). That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is the square of the modulus.\n\nSo, the product is (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n(-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * (-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, P = 8321.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check my steps because 8321 is the product of ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ), which is equal to the product over x\u22601 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). So, P is equal to 8321.\n\nBut wait, the original product was from k=0 to 12, but when k=0, the term was 1, so P is indeed 8321.\n\nWait, but let me check my computations again because 8321 seems a bit high, and I need to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13:\n\nExpressed in polar form: modulus sqrt(2), angle \u03c0/4.\n\nRaising to 13th power: modulus (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nAngle: 13*(\u03c0/4) = 13\u03c0/4. 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is the same as \u03c0/4 beyond 3\u03c0. But since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*1 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) + sqrt(2)*(-i sqrt(2)/2)).\n\nCompute sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2)*(-i sqrt(2)/2) = (-i * 2)/2 = -i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*(-1 - i) = -64(1 + i). That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nWhich gives 64*(-1 + i) = -64(1 - i). Correct.\n\nSubtracting 1:\n\n(1 + i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nMultiplying these two:\n\n(-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Correct.\n\nSo, the product P is 8321.\n\nWait, but the problem says to find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000. The remainder is the last three digits.\n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning.\n\nWait, another thought: when I took the product over x\u22601 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2), I considered it equal to the product over all x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). But is that correct?\n\nBecause when x=1, (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So, the product over all x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over x\u22601 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) multiplied by 1, which is the same as the product over x\u22601. So, yes, my reasoning was correct.\n\nTherefore, P = 8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, the answer should be 321.\n\n\nThe problem requires finding the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive 13th root of unity.\n\nFirst, note that each term in the product can be rewritten as \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\) where \\(x = \\omega^k\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy \u03c9^n = 1, where n is the order. In this case, \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, so \u03c9^13 = 1. Also, since \u03c9 \u2260 1, it's a primitive root, right?\n\nThe expression I need to compute is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). That's 13 terms multiplied together. Since \u03c9 is a root of unity, maybe I can find a clever way to simplify this product without multiplying all the terms manually, which would be tedious.\n\nLet me first consider the expression inside the product: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or relate it to some polynomial.\n\nWait, I notice that \u03c9^{2k} is (\u03c9^k)^2. So, the expression becomes 2 - 2\u03c9^k + (\u03c9^k)^2. Let me denote x = \u03c9^k. Then, the expression is 2 - 2x + x\u00b2. So, the term is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. \n\nSo, the product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) where x = \u03c9^k. But \u03c9^k are all the 13th roots of unity except 1, right? Wait, no, when k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1. So, for k=0, the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1\u00b2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So, the first term is 1.\n\nTherefore, the product is 1 multiplied by the product over k=1 to 12 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) where x = \u03c9^k. So, the product is the same as the product over all x where x is a 13th root of unity (including 1), but since when x=1, the term is 1, which doesn't affect the product, we can consider x ranging over all 13th roots of unity.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when k=0, x=1, and the term is 1. For k=1 to 12, x are the other 12 roots. So, the product is the product over x^13 = 1 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). But wait, that would include x=1 as well. But in our original problem, the product starts at k=0, which gives x=1. So, yes, the product is over all 13th roots of unity.\n\nTherefore, the product is equal to the product for x^13=1 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). So, maybe I can compute this product using complex analysis or properties of polynomials.\n\nI remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product of (x - a_i) where a_i are the roots is equal to f(x). So, perhaps I can relate this product to a certain polynomial evaluated at specific points.\n\nWait, but here we have a product over all roots of x^13 - 1 = 0 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). So, this is similar to evaluating the resultant or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1, which factors as the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12. So, the product I'm trying to compute is the product over (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2, which is the same as product over (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe I can write this product as the product over (x^2 - 2x + 2) where x runs through all the roots of x^13 = 1. So, the product is equal to the resultant of x^13 - 1 and x^2 - 2x + 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the product over (x - a_i) for a_i roots of f(x) is f(x), so maybe the product over (a_i^2 - 2a_i + 2) is equal to the product over f evaluated at each a_i, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: If I have a polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1, and I want the product over all roots \u03c9^k of (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2. That's the same as evaluating the product over all roots of f(x) of (x^2 - 2x + 2). So, I think this is the same as the resultant of f(x) and x^2 - 2x + 2.\n\nBut I'm not exactly sure how to compute that. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the product as the absolute value of the value of some polynomial at a certain point.\n\nWait, another idea: Let me consider that the product over (x^2 - 2x + 2) for x being the roots of x^13 - 1 is equal to the product over (x^2 - 2x + 2) for x^13 = 1. So, the product is equal to the product over x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2).\n\nBut since x^13 = 1, we can write x^13 = 1, so x^k = x^{k mod 13}. Maybe I can express this as a polynomial in x and substitute x^13 = 1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of cyclotomic polynomials. The 13th cyclotomic polynomial is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1, since 13 is prime. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that the product over (x^2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)), since x^2 - 2x + 2 factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, the product becomes the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich is equal to the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i)) multiplied by the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 - i)).\n\nBut the product over x^13=1 of (x - a) is equal to a^13 - 1, because x^13 - 1 = product_{x^13=1} (x - 1). Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The polynomial x^13 - 1 factors as product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k), where \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root. So, the product over x^13=1 of (x - a) is equal to a^13 - 1, because when you plug x=a into x^13 - 1, you get a^13 - 1.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The product over (x - a) for x being the roots of x^13 - 1 is equal to x^13 - 1. But if we substitute x = a, we get a^13 - 1, which is the same as the product over x^13=1 of (a - x). Wait, so the product over x^13=1 of (a - x) is a^13 - 1.\n\nBut in our case, the product is over (x - (1 + i)) for x^13=1. So, that would be equal to (1 + i)^13 - 1. Wait, because product_{x^13=1} (x - a) = a^13 - 1. Wait, let me think again.\n\nSuppose f(x) = x^13 - 1. Then f(a) = product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k). So, f(a) = a^13 - 1. So, product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1.\n\nBut in our case, the product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a). Which is the same as (-1)^13 product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = - product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = - (a^13 - 1).\n\nWait, that's correct. Because product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = product_{k=0}^{12} (-1)(a - \u03c9^k) = (-1)^13 product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = - (a^13 - 1).\n\nSo, in our problem, the product over (x^2 - 2x + 2) for x^13=1 is equal to product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Which factors as product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, this is equal to [product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nEach of these products can be evaluated using the formula I just thought of. So, for the first product, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = -[(1 + i)^13 - 1]. Similarly, the second product is -[(1 - i)^13 - 1].\n\nWait, let me verify. Earlier, I saw that product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = -(a^13 - 1). So, yes, so the first term is -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ), and the second term is -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nSo, the entire product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nWhich simplifies to [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nSo, now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents. 13\u03c0/4 can be simplified by subtracting multiples of 2\u03c0. 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so subtract 2\u03c0: 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, -13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4 = -5\u03c0/4, but since angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, e^{-i5\u03c0/4} is the same as e^{i3\u03c0/4}.\n\nWait, let me check: 13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is the same as \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, -13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to -5\u03c0/4, which is the same as 3\u03c0/4 because adding 2\u03c0 gives 3\u03c0/4.\n\nWait, actually, angles are periodic with 2\u03c0, so e^{i\u03b8} = e^{i(\u03b8 + 2\u03c0k)} for any integer k.\n\nSo, 13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Subtracting 2\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/4), we get 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i(5\u03c0/4)} = e^{i(2\u03c0 - 5\u03c0/4)} = e^{i3\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i5\u03c0/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * (cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i3\u03c0/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * (cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4)).\n\nCompute these:\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\ncos(3\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) ].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) ].\n\nLet me compute these step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13:\n\nMultiply 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i).\n\nsqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) * (-1/2) = 2 * (-1/2) = -1.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * (-1) * (1 + i) = -64(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i).\n\nAgain, sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -1.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * (-1) * (1 - i) = -64(1 - i).\n\nNow, plug these back into the product.\n\nThe product is [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nWhich is [ (-64(1 + i) - 1 ) ] * [ (-64(1 - i) - 1 ) ].\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 - 64i - 1 = -65 - 64i.\n\nSecond term: -64(1 - i) - 1 = -64 + 64i - 1 = -65 + 64i.\n\nSo, the product is (-65 - 64i) * (-65 + 64i).\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nAlternatively, compute it directly:\n\n(-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication:\n\n(-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 + (-65)(64i) + (-64i)(-65) + (-64i)(64i).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, it's (a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2, where a = -65, b = 64i. So, it's (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * i^2) = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Therefore, the original product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, the original product was product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = 8321.\n\nWait, but the problem states that \u03c9 \u2260 1 is a 13th root of unity, so when k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1, and the term is 1 as I computed earlier. So, the product is indeed 8321.\n\nBut the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321.\n\nWait, 8 * 1000 = 8000, and 8321 - 8000 = 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 321.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. Let me go through the steps again.\n\n1. The product is over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\n2. Factor each term as x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, where x = \u03c9^k.\n\n3. The product is equal to the product over all x^13=1 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2).\n\n4. Factor x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\n5. So, the product becomes [product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i))] * [product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 - i))].\n\n6. Each product is equal to -( (1 \u00b1 i)^13 - 1 ).\n\n7. Compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 using polar form.\n\n8. (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\n9. Subtract 1 from each: (-64(1 + i) - 1) = -65 -64i, (-64(1 - i) - 1) = -65 +64i.\n\n10. Multiply these two: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = 8321.\n\n11. 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, the steps seem correct. Therefore, the answer should be 321.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy \u03c9^n = 1, where n is the order. In this case, \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, so \u03c9^13 = 1. Also, since \u03c9 \u2260 1, it's a primitive root, right?\n\nThe expression I need to compute is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). That's 13 terms multiplied together. Since \u03c9 is a root of unity, maybe I can find a clever way to simplify this product without multiplying all the terms manually, which would be tedious.\n\nLet me first consider the expression inside the product: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or relate it to some polynomial.\n\nWait, I notice that \u03c9^{2k} is (\u03c9^k)^2. So, the expression becomes 2 - 2\u03c9^k + (\u03c9^k)^2. Let me denote x = \u03c9^k. Then, the expression is 2 - 2x + x\u00b2. So, the term is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. \n\nSo, the product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) where x = \u03c9^k. But \u03c9^k are all the 13th roots of unity except 1, right? Wait, no, when k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1. So, for k=0, the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1\u00b2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So, the first term is 1.\n\nTherefore, the product is 1 multiplied by the product over k=1 to 12 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) where x = \u03c9^k. So, the product is the same as the product over all x where x is a 13th root of unity (including 1), but since when x=1, the term is 1, which doesn't affect the product, we can consider x ranging over all 13th roots of unity.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when k=0, x=1, and the term is 1. For k=1 to 12, x are the other 12 roots. So, the product is the product over x^13 = 1 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). But wait, that would include x=1 as well. But in our original problem, the product starts at k=0, which gives x=1. So, yes, the product is over all 13th roots of unity.\n\nTherefore, the product is equal to the product for x^13=1 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). So, maybe I can compute this product using complex analysis or properties of polynomials.\n\nI remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product of (x - a_i) where a_i are the roots is equal to f(x). So, perhaps I can relate this product to a certain polynomial evaluated at specific points.\n\nWait, but here we have a product over all roots of x^13 - 1 = 0 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). So, this is similar to evaluating the resultant or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1, which factors as the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12. So, the product I'm trying to compute is the product over (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2, which is the same as product over (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe I can write this product as the product over (x^2 - 2x + 2) where x runs through all the roots of x^13 = 1. So, the product is equal to the resultant of x^13 - 1 and x^2 - 2x + 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the product over (x - a_i) for a_i roots of f(x) is f(x), so maybe the product over (a_i^2 - 2a_i + 2) is equal to the product over f evaluated at each a_i, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: If I have a polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1, and I want the product over all roots \u03c9^k of (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2. That's the same as evaluating the product over all roots of f(x) of (x^2 - 2x + 2). So, I think this is the same as the resultant of f(x) and x^2 - 2x + 2.\n\nBut I'm not exactly sure how to compute that. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the product as the absolute value of the value of some polynomial at a certain point.\n\nWait, another idea: Let me consider that the product over (x^2 - 2x + 2) for x being the roots of x^13 - 1 is equal to the product over (x^2 - 2x + 2) for x^13 = 1. So, the product is equal to the product over x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2).\n\nBut since x^13 = 1, we can write x^13 = 1, so x^k = x^{k mod 13}. Maybe I can express this as a polynomial in x and substitute x^13 = 1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of cyclotomic polynomials. The 13th cyclotomic polynomial is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1, since 13 is prime. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that the product over (x^2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)), since x^2 - 2x + 2 factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, the product becomes the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich is equal to the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i)) multiplied by the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 - i)).\n\nBut the product over x^13=1 of (x - a) is equal to a^13 - 1, because x^13 - 1 = product_{x^13=1} (x - 1). Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The polynomial x^13 - 1 factors as product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k), where \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root. So, the product over x^13=1 of (x - a) is equal to a^13 - 1, because when you plug x=a into x^13 - 1, you get a^13 - 1.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The product over (x - a) for x being the roots of x^13 - 1 is equal to x^13 - 1. But if we substitute x = a, we get a^13 - 1, which is the same as the product over x^13=1 of (a - x). Wait, so the product over x^13=1 of (a - x) is a^13 - 1.\n\nBut in our case, the product is over (x - (1 + i)) for x^13=1. So, that would be equal to (1 + i)^13 - 1. Wait, because product_{x^13=1} (x - a) = a^13 - 1. Wait, let me think again.\n\nSuppose f(x) = x^13 - 1. Then f(a) = product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k). So, f(a) = a^13 - 1. So, product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1.\n\nBut in our case, the product is product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a). Which is the same as (-1)^13 product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = - product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = - (a^13 - 1).\n\nWait, that's correct. Because product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = product_{k=0}^{12} (-1)(a - \u03c9^k) = (-1)^13 product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = - (a^13 - 1).\n\nSo, in our problem, the product over (x^2 - 2x + 2) for x^13=1 is equal to product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Which factors as product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, this is equal to [product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nEach of these products can be evaluated using the formula I just thought of. So, for the first product, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = -[(1 + i)^13 - 1]. Similarly, the second product is -[(1 - i)^13 - 1].\n\nWait, let me verify. Earlier, I saw that product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = -(a^13 - 1). So, yes, so the first term is -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ), and the second term is -( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nSo, the entire product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nWhich simplifies to [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nSo, now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents. 13\u03c0/4 can be simplified by subtracting multiples of 2\u03c0. 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so subtract 2\u03c0: 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, -13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4 = -5\u03c0/4, but since angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, e^{-i5\u03c0/4} is the same as e^{i3\u03c0/4}.\n\nWait, let me check: 13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is the same as \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, -13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to -5\u03c0/4, which is the same as 3\u03c0/4 because adding 2\u03c0 gives 3\u03c0/4.\n\nWait, actually, angles are periodic with 2\u03c0, so e^{i\u03b8} = e^{i(\u03b8 + 2\u03c0k)} for any integer k.\n\nSo, 13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Subtracting 2\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/4), we get 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i(5\u03c0/4)} = e^{i(2\u03c0 - 5\u03c0/4)} = e^{i3\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i5\u03c0/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * (cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i3\u03c0/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * (cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4)).\n\nCompute these:\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\ncos(3\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) ].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) ].\n\nLet me compute these step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13:\n\nMultiply 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i).\n\nsqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) * (-1/2) = 2 * (-1/2) = -1.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * (-1) * (1 + i) = -64(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i).\n\nAgain, sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -1.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * (-1) * (1 - i) = -64(1 - i).\n\nNow, plug these back into the product.\n\nThe product is [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nWhich is [ (-64(1 + i) - 1 ) ] * [ (-64(1 - i) - 1 ) ].\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 - 64i - 1 = -65 - 64i.\n\nSecond term: -64(1 - i) - 1 = -64 + 64i - 1 = -65 + 64i.\n\nSo, the product is (-65 - 64i) * (-65 + 64i).\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nAlternatively, compute it directly:\n\n(-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication:\n\n(-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 + (-65)(64i) + (-64i)(-65) + (-64i)(64i).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, it's (a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2, where a = -65, b = 64i. So, it's (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * i^2) = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Therefore, the original product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, the original product was product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = 8321.\n\nWait, but the problem states that \u03c9 \u2260 1 is a 13th root of unity, so when k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1, and the term is 1 as I computed earlier. So, the product is indeed 8321.\n\nBut the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321.\n\nWait, 8 * 1000 = 8000, and 8321 - 8000 = 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 321.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. Let me go through the steps again.\n\n1. The product is over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\n2. Factor each term as x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, where x = \u03c9^k.\n\n3. The product is equal to the product over all x^13=1 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2).\n\n4. Factor x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\n5. So, the product becomes [product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i))] * [product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 - i))].\n\n6. Each product is equal to -( (1 \u00b1 i)^13 - 1 ).\n\n7. Compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 using polar form.\n\n8. (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\n9. Subtract 1 from each: (-64(1 + i) - 1) = -65 -64i, (-64(1 - i) - 1) = -65 +64i.\n\n10. Multiply these two: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = 8321.\n\n11. 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, the steps seem correct. Therefore, the answer should be 321.\n\n\nThe given problem involves computing the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) where \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) is a 13th root of unity, and finding its remainder when divided by 1000.\n\nFirst, we note that each term in the product can be rewritten as \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\) where \\(x = \\omega^k\\). This expression factors into \\((x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i))\\). Thus, the entire product becomes the product over all 13th roots of unity \\(x\\) of \\((x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i))\\).\n\nUsing properties of polynomials, the product over all roots of unity \\(x\\) of \\((x - a)\\) is given by \\(a^{13} - 1\\). However, since we're dealing with \\((x - (1 + i))\\) and \\((x - (1 - i))\\), the product becomes \\([-( (1 + i)^{13} - 1 )] \\times [-( (1 - i)^{13} - 1 )]\\).\n\nCalculating \\((1 + i)^{13}\\) and \\((1 - i)^{13}\\) in polar form, we find:\n\\[\n(1 + i)^{13} = -64(1 + i), \\quad (1 - i)^{13} = -64(1 - i).\n\\]\nSubtracting 1 from each and multiplying the results gives:\n\\[\n(-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = 8321.\n\\]\nFinally, computing \\(8321 \\mod 1000\\) yields the remainder 321.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{321}\n\\]",
