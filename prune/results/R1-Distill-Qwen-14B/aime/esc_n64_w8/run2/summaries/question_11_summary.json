      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again: Find the largest possible real part of (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay.\n\nI remember that for complex numbers, especially when dealing with expressions involving z and 1/z, there might be some properties or theorems that could help. Since the magnitude of z is given as 4, that might be useful. Let me jot down what I know.\n\nFirst, z is a complex number such that |z| = 4. That means if I write z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. Because the magnitude is 4, so in polar form, it's 4 times e raised to i\u03b8. That could be helpful.\n\nSo, let's denote z = 4e^{i\u03b8}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}, since 1/z is the reciprocal of z, and the magnitude becomes 1/|z|, and the argument is negative.\n\nSo, substituting z into the expression:\n\n(75 + 117i) * z + (96 + 144i)/z\n= (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nLet me compute each part separately.\n\nFirst, compute (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8}:\n= 4*(75 + 117i) * e^{i\u03b8}\n= (300 + 468i) * e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSimilarly, compute (96 + 144i) * (1/4) e^{-i\u03b8}:\n= (24 + 36i) * e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n(300 + 468i) e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i) e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nHmm, I can write this as a sum of two complex exponentials. I think I can represent this in terms of sine and cosine. Remembering that e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8 and e^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this as a single complex number in terms of cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8.\n\nLet me denote A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i. So the expression is A e^{i\u03b8} + B e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nI recall that for such expressions, the real part can be found by taking the real component of each term. Alternatively, I can write this as A*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) + B*(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8).\n\nExpanding that, it's (A + B) cos\u03b8 + i (A - B) sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\nA e^{i\u03b8} = A cos\u03b8 + i A sin\u03b8\nB e^{-i\u03b8} = B cos\u03b8 - i B sin\u03b8\n\nSo adding them together:\n\n(A cos\u03b8 + B cos\u03b8) + i (A sin\u03b8 - B sin\u03b8)\n= (A + B) cos\u03b8 + i (A - B) sin\u03b8.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the entire expression is (A + B) cos\u03b8 + i (A - B) sin\u03b8.\n\nBut we are interested in the real part of the original expression. So the real part would be Re[(A + B) cos\u03b8 + i (A - B) sin\u03b8] = (A + B) cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me think again. Because (A + B) is a complex number. So when I write (A + B) cos\u03b8, that's a complex number multiplied by cos\u03b8. Similarly, (A - B) is a complex number multiplied by sin\u03b8, but since it's multiplied by i, it's part of the imaginary component.\n\nWait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me clarify.\n\nThe expression is (A + B) cos\u03b8 + i (A - B) sin\u03b8. But the original expression is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. So the entire expression is a complex number, and we need its real part. So the real part is the real part of [(A + B) cos\u03b8 + i (A - B) sin\u03b8], which is Re[(A + B) cos\u03b8] + Re[i (A - B) sin\u03b8].\n\nWait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a single complex number and find its real part.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to write z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, then write 1/z as (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}, and then compute the expression.\n\nLet me try that again. Let's compute (75 + 117i) z + (96 + 144i)/z.\n\nSo,\n\n(75 + 117i) * 4 e^{i\u03b8} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4) e^{-i\u03b8}\n= [4*(75 + 117i)] e^{i\u03b8} + [ (96 + 144i)/4 ] e^{-i\u03b8}\n= [300 + 468i] e^{i\u03b8} + [24 + 36i] e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nLet me denote C = 300 + 468i and D = 24 + 36i. So the expression is C e^{i\u03b8} + D e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nNow, to find the real part of this expression, Re(C e^{i\u03b8} + D e^{-i\u03b8}) = Re(C e^{i\u03b8}) + Re(D e^{-i\u03b8}).\n\nWhich is equal to Re(C) cos\u03b8 - Im(C) sin\u03b8 + Re(D) cos\u03b8 + Im(D) sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, because Re(C e^{i\u03b8}) = Re(C (cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)) = Re(C cos\u03b8 - Im(C) sin\u03b8). Similarly, Re(D e^{-i\u03b8}) = Re(D (cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8)) = Re(D cos\u03b8 + Im(D) sin\u03b8).\n\nSo combining these:\n\nRe(C) cos\u03b8 - Im(C) sin\u03b8 + Re(D) cos\u03b8 + Im(D) sin\u03b8\n= [Re(C) + Re(D)] cos\u03b8 + [Im(D) - Im(C)] sin\u03b8\n\nSo the real part is [Re(C) + Re(D)] cos\u03b8 + [Im(D) - Im(C)] sin\u03b8.\n\nLet me compute Re(C) and Re(D):\n\nRe(C) = 300, Im(C) = 468\nRe(D) = 24, Im(D) = 36\n\nSo,\n\n[Re(C) + Re(D)] = 300 + 24 = 324\n[Im(D) - Im(C)] = 36 - 468 = -432\n\nSo the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nHmm, okay. So the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. Now, we need to find the maximum value of this expression as \u03b8 varies.\n\nThat's a standard trigonometric expression. The maximum value of a cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8 is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). But in our case, it's 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8, which is a cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8 with a=324 and b=-432.\n\nWait, but the formula is a cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8 = R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2), and \u03c6 is some phase shift. The maximum value is R, the amplitude.\n\nSo, let me compute R.\n\nR = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2).\n\nLet me compute 324\u00b2 and 432\u00b2.\n\n324 squared: 324 * 324. Let me compute that.\n\n300\u00b2 = 90000, 24\u00b2=576, and cross term 2*300*24=14400.\n\nSo (300 +24)^2 = 300\u00b2 + 2*300*24 +24\u00b2 = 90000 +14400 +576 = 90000 +14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104976.\n\nSimilarly, 432 squared: Let's see, 400\u00b2=160000, 32\u00b2=1024, and cross term 2*400*32=25600.\n\nSo (400 +32)^2 = 160000 + 25600 + 1024 = 160000 +25600 is 185600, plus 1024 is 186624.\n\nSo R = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600).\n\nWhat's sqrt(291600)? Let me compute 540\u00b2: 540*540 = (500 +40)^2 = 500\u00b2 + 2*500*40 +40\u00b2= 250000 +40000 +1600= 291600. Yes! So R=540.\n\nSo the maximum value of 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 is 540.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible real part is 540.\n\nWait, let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistake.\n\nFirst, I wrote z =4 e^{i\u03b8}, since |z|=4. Then, I expressed the given expression in terms of exponentials, which gave me 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 for the real part. Then, I recognized that this is a linear combination of cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8, which can be expressed as R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), and the maximum value is R. So R is sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2) = 540. So yes, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let me think about using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or something similar.\n\nWait, another approach is to consider that for any complex number a and b, Re(a z + b /z ) can be expressed in terms of real and imaginary parts, but I think the method I used is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using calculus. Let me set f(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. To find its maximum, take derivative and set to zero.\n\nf'(\u03b8) = -324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8. Setting this equal to zero:\n\n-324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8 =0\n\nDivide both sides by -36: 9 sin\u03b8 + 12 cos\u03b8 =0\n\nSo 9 sin\u03b8 = -12 cos\u03b8\n\nDivide both sides by cos\u03b8 (assuming cos\u03b8 \u22600):\n\n9 tan\u03b8 = -12 \u2192 tan\u03b8 = -12/9 = -4/3\n\nSo \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3). Let's compute sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8.\n\nIf tan\u03b8 = -4/3, then we can imagine a right triangle with opposite side -4 and adjacent 3, but since tan is negative, \u03b8 is in the second or fourth quadrant. But since in our expression, we have cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8, let me consider \u03b8 in the fourth quadrant.\n\nSo, in the fourth quadrant, cos\u03b8 = 3 / 5, sin\u03b8 = -4 /5.\n\nWait, because if tan\u03b8 = -4/3, then the reference angle is arctan(4/3). So in the fourth quadrant, cos\u03b8 is positive, sin\u03b8 is negative.\n\nSo cos\u03b8 = 3/5, sin\u03b8 = -4/5.\n\nNow, plug into f(\u03b8):\n\nf(\u03b8) = 324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5)\n= (324*3)/5 + (432*4)/5\n= (972 + 1728)/5\n= 2700 /5\n= 540\n\nSo that's the maximum value, confirming our earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, if \u03b8 is in the second quadrant, cos\u03b8 would be negative, and sin\u03b8 positive. Let's check:\n\ncos\u03b8 = -3/5, sin\u03b8 =4/5.\n\nThen f(\u03b8) = 324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5)\n= (-972 -1728)/5\n= (-2700)/5\n= -540\n\nWhich is the minimum. So the maximum is indeed 540.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible real part is 540.\n",

Setting this equal to zero:\n\n-324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8 =0\n\nDivide both sides by -36: 9 sin\u03b8 + 12 cos\u03b8 =0\n\nSo 9 sin\u03b8 = -12 cos\u03b8\n\nDivide both sides by cos\u03b8 (assuming cos\u03b8 \u22600):\n\n9 tan\u03b8 = -12 \u2192 tan\u03b8 = -12/9 = -4/3\n\nSo \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3). Let's compute sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8.\n\nIf tan\u03b8 = -4/3, then we can imagine a right triangle with opposite side -4 and adjacent 3, but since tan is negative, \u03b8 is in the second or fourth quadrant. But since in our expression, we have cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8, let me consider \u03b8 in the fourth quadrant.\n\nSo, in the fourth quadrant, cos\u03b8 = 3 / 5, sin\u03b8 = -4 /5.\n\nWait, because if tan\u03b8 = -4/3, then the reference angle is arctan(4/3). So in the fourth quadrant, cos\u03b8 is positive, sin\u03b8 is negative.\n\nSo cos\u03b8 = 3/5, sin\u03b8 = -4/5.\n\nNow, plug into f(\u03b8):\n\nf(\u03b8) = 324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5)\n= (324*3)/5 + (432*4)/5\n= (972 + 1728)/5\n= 2700 /5\n= 540\n\nSo that's the maximum value, confirming our earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, if \u03b8 is in the second quadrant, cos\u03b8 would be negative, and sin\u03b8 positive. Let's check:\n\ncos\u03b8 = -3/5, sin\u03b8 =4/5.\n\nThen f(\u03b8) = 324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5)\n= (-972 -1728)/5\n= (-2700)/5\n= -540\n\nWhich is the minimum. So the maximum is indeed 540.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible real part is 540.\n\n\nThe largest possible real part of the expression is \\boxed{540}.",

So the real part is:\n\n324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8\n\nWe need to find the maximum value of this expression as \u03b8 varies.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum of 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nThis is a linear combination of sine and cosine, so I can write it as R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is the amplitude.\n\nThe maximum value of R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) is R, so the maximum real part is R.\n\nCompute R:\n\nR = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2)\n\nLet me compute 324^2 and 432^2.\n\n324^2: 324 * 324. Let's compute:\n\n300^2 = 90000\n\n24^2 = 576\n\nCross term: 2*300*24 = 14400\n\nSo 324^2 = (300 +24)^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 105, 90000 +14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432^2:\n\n400^2 = 160000\n\n32^2=1024\n\nCross term: 2*400*32=25600\n\nSo 432^2 = (400 +32)^2= 160000 +25600 +1024= 160000+25600=185600 +1024=186,624.\n\nSo R^2=324^2 +432^2=104,976 + 186,624=291,600.\n\nSo R= sqrt(291600). Let's compute that.\n\nWell, sqrt(291600) = sqrt(2916 * 100) = sqrt(2916)*10.\n\nWhat's sqrt(2916)?\n\nLet me see: 50^2=2500, 54^2=2916.\n\nYes, 54*54=2916. So sqrt(2916)=54.\n\nSo R=54*10=540.\n\nSo the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, but let me check the signs again because the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo in the formula, R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is sqrt(A^2 + B^2), and A is the coefficient of cos\u03b8, B is the coefficient of sin\u03b8.\n\nIn our case, A=324, B=-432.\n\nSo R= sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2)=sqrt(104976 + 186624)=sqrt(291600)=540.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo the maximum value of 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 is 540.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible real part is 540.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because when I express it as R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), the maximum is R, but only if the expression is correctly transformed. Let me double-check the transformation.\n\nAlternatively, the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Let me write this as M cos\u03b8 + N sin\u03b8, where M=324, N=-432.\n\nThe maximum of M cos\u03b8 + N sin\u03b8 is sqrt(M^2 + N^2), regardless of the signs.\n\nBecause:\n\nM cos\u03b8 + N sin\u03b8 = sqrt(M^2 + N^2) * [ (M/sqrt(M^2 + N^2)) cos\u03b8 + (N/sqrt(M^2 + N^2)) sin\u03b8 ]\n\nWhich is sqrt(M^2 + N^2) cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6), where \u03c6 is such that cos\u03c6 = M/sqrt(M^2 + N^2) and sin\u03c6 = N/sqrt(M^2 + N^2).\n\nSo yes, the maximum is sqrt(M^2 + N^2), which is sqrt(324^2 +432^2)=540.\n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I computed R correctly. Because 324 and 432, perhaps they have a common factor that can be simplified.\n\n324 and 432: let's see, 324 divides by 4: 81, 432 divides by 4: 108. 81 and 108: 81 divides by 9:9, 108 divides by 9:12. So 324 = 4*81 =4*9*9=36*9, 432=4*108=4*12*9=48*9.\n\nSo 324=36*9, 432=48*9.\n\nSo 324^2 +432^2= (36^2 +48^2)*9^2= (1296 + 2304)*81= 3600 *81=291600. Which is correct.\n\nSo sqrt(291600)=540.\n\nThus, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nI think that's it. So the largest possible real part is 540.\n",

Because 324 and 432, perhaps they have a common factor that can be simplified.\n\n324 and 432: let's see, 324 divides by 4: 81, 432 divides by 4: 108. 81 and 108: 81 divides by 9:9, 108 divides by 9:12. So 324 = 4*81 =4*9*9=36*9, 432=4*108=4*12*9=48*9.\n\nSo 324=36*9, 432=48*9.\n\nSo 324^2 +432^2= (36^2 +48^2)*9^2= (1296 + 2304)*81= 3600 *81=291600. Which is correct.\n\nSo sqrt(291600)=540.\n\nThus, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nI think that's it. So the largest possible real part is 540.\n\n\nTo find the largest possible real part of the expression \\[(75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\] where \\( z \\) is a complex number with \\( |z| = 4 \\), we start by expressing \\( z \\) in polar form as \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\). This allows us to rewrite the expression as:\n\n\\[\n(75 + 117i) \\cdot 4e^{i\\theta} + \\frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\\theta}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term, we find the real part of the expression to be:\n\n\\[\n324 \\cos\\theta - 432 \\sin\\theta\n\\]\n\nTo maximize this expression, we recognize it as a linear combination of sine and cosine. The maximum value of \\( A \\cos\\theta + B \\sin\\theta \\) is \\( \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \\). Calculating this:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \\sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \\sqrt{291600} = 540\n\\]\n\nThus, the largest possible real part of the given expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{540}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that any complex number z with |z| = 4 can be written in the form z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. Alternatively, z can also be represented as 4(cos\u03b8 + isin\u03b8). Maybe using the exponential form will make things easier, especially when dealing with reciprocals like 1/z.\n\nWait, since |z| = 4, then |1/z| = 1/4, right? Because the modulus of 1/z is the reciprocal of the modulus of z. So, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}, since taking the reciprocal inverts the argument.\n\nSo, let me write z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, which means 1/z is (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. Now, substituting these into the original expression.\n\nThe first term is (75 + 117i)z. Let me compute that:\n\n(75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8} = (75*4 + 117*4i)e^{i\u03b8} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8}.\n\nSimilarly, the second term is (96 + 144i)/z, which is (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, the entire expression becomes:\n\n(300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nNow, I need to find the real part of this expression and then maximize it with respect to \u03b8.\n\nLet me compute each part separately.\n\nFirst, expand (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8}. Using Euler's formula, e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8. So,\n\n(300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) = 300cos\u03b8 + 300i sin\u03b8 + 468i cos\u03b8 + 468i^2 sin\u03b8.\n\nSince i^2 = -1, this simplifies to:\n\n300cos\u03b8 + (300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8)i - 468 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, the real part of the first term is 300cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8, and the imaginary part is 300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, let's expand the second term: (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}. Since e^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8,\n\n(24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) = 24cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 - 36i^2 sin\u03b8.\n\nAgain, i^2 = -1, so:\n\n24cos\u03b8 + ( -24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8 )i + 36 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, the real part of the second term is 24cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8, and the imaginary part is -24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8.\n\nNow, adding the real parts of both terms together:\n\nReal part of the entire expression = [300cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8] + [24cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8] = (300 + 24)cos\u03b8 + (-468 + 36)sin\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part would be [300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8] + [ -24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8 ] = (300 -24) sin\u03b8 + (468 +36) cos\u03b8 = 276 sin\u03b8 + 504 cos\u03b8.\n\nBut since we're only interested in the real part, we can focus on maximizing 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nHmm, this seems like a standard maximization problem for an expression of the form A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, which I know can be rewritten as C cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where C is the amplitude and \u03c6 is some phase shift.\n\nThe maximum value of such an expression is the amplitude, which is sqrt(A^2 + B^2). So, in this case, A is 324 and B is -432.\n\nSo, the maximum real part is sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2).\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 324^2. 324 squared: 324 * 324.\n\nHmm, 300^2 = 90,000, 24^2 = 576, and cross terms 2*300*24=14,400. So, (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 105, 90,000 +14,400 is 104,400, plus 576 is 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432^2: 400^2 is 160,000, 32^2 is 1,024, and cross term 2*400*32 = 25,600. So, 400 + 32 squared is 160,000 +25,600 +1,024 = 186,624.\n\nSo, 324^2 = 104,976, and 432^2 is 186,624.\n\nSo, adding them together: 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.\n\nThen, sqrt(291,600). Let me see, 500 squared is 250,000, 600 squared is 360,000, so it's somewhere between 500 and 600. Let's try 540: 540^2 is 291,600. Yes! So sqrt(291,600) is 540.\n\nSo, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check. Because sometimes when you have a function like A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, the maximum is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), but in this case, the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8, which is A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 with A=324 and B=-432. So, yes, the maximum is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2)=sqrt(104,976 +186,624)=sqrt(291,600)=540.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible real part is 540.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes earlier in computing the real parts.\n\nSo, the first term: (75 + 117i)z.\n\nz =4e^{i\u03b8}, so (75 +117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} = (300 +468i)e^{i\u03b8}.\n\nWhen I multiply by e^{i\u03b8}, it's like rotating the complex number, so the real part is 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because (a + ib)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) = a cos\u03b8 - b sin\u03b8 + i(a sin\u03b8 + b cos\u03b8). Yes, so real part is a cos\u03b8 - b sin\u03b8, where a=300, b=468.\n\nSimilarly, the second term: (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)*(1/4)e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nMultiplying (24 +36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) = 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 +i(-24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8). So, real part is 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8.\n\nAdding the two real parts: 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8 +24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 = (300+24)cos\u03b8 + (-468 +36) sin\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the expression we're maximizing is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, which is indeed A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 with A=324 and B=-432.\n\nSo, the maximum value is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2) = sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600) = 540.\n\nSo, that should be the maximum real part.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to write the expression as (324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8) = R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2) =540, so the maximum is 540.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using vectors or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or something like that. Hmm.\n\nWait, but in this case, since it's a single-variable optimization (only \u03b8 to vary), the method I used is probably the simplest.\n\nSo, I think I can be confident that the maximum real part is 540.\n",

Hmm.\n\nWait, but in this case, since it's a single-variable optimization (only \u03b8 to vary), the method I used is probably the simplest.\n\nSo, I think I can be confident that the maximum real part is 540.\n\n\nTo find the largest possible real part of the expression \\((75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\) where \\(|z| = 4\\), we start by expressing \\(z\\) as \\(4e^{i\\theta}\\). Then, the reciprocal \\(1/z\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta}\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\) into the expression:\n\n1. Expand \\((75 + 117i)z\\):\n   \\[\n   (75 + 117i) \\cdot 4e^{i\\theta} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta}\n   \\]\n   The real part is \\(300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\):\n   \\[\n   (96 + 144i) \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\n   \\]\n   The real part is \\(24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta\\).\n\nAdding the real parts together:\n\\[\n\\text{Real part} = (300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta) + (24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta) = 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta\n\\]\n\nTo maximize \\(324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta\\), we use the formula for the maximum of \\(A\\cos\\theta + B\\sin\\theta\\), which is \\(\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \\sqrt{104,976 + 186,624} = \\sqrt{291,600} = 540\n\\]\n\nThus, the largest possible real part is \\(\\boxed{540}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, alright, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that any complex number z with |z| = 4 can be written in the form z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. That might make things easier because working with exponentials can sometimes simplify multiplication and division.\n\nSo, let me express z as 4e^{i\u03b8}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}, since the reciprocal of e^{i\u03b8} is e^{-i\u03b8} and the magnitude is 1/4.\n\nNow, let me substitute these into the expression:\n\n(75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: 4*(75 + 117i) e^{i\u03b8} = (300 + 468i) e^{i\u03b8}.\n\nSecond term: (96 + 144i)/4 = 24 + 36i, so it's (24 + 36i) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\n(300 + 468i) e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, I need to find the real part of this expression. The real part of a complex number is the part without the i, so I need to compute Re[(300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}].\n\nI know that for any complex number a + bi, Re[(a + bi)e^{i\u03b8}] can be found by expressing e^{i\u03b8} as cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8 and multiplying. Alternatively, I might recall that Re[ (x + iy)e^{i\u03b8} ] is x cos\u03b8 - y sin\u03b8, because when you multiply (x + iy)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8), the real part is x cos\u03b8 - y sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. Let me compute (x + iy)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8):\n\n= x cos\u03b8 + x i sin\u03b8 + iy cos\u03b8 + iy i sin\u03b8\n= x cos\u03b8 + i x sin\u03b8 + i y cos\u03b8 - y sin\u03b8\n= (x cos\u03b8 - y sin\u03b8) + i (x sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8).\n\nYes, so the real part is x cos\u03b8 - y sin\u03b8. So for the first term, (300 + 468i) e^{i\u03b8}, the real part is 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8. Similarly, the second term is (24 + 36i) e^{-i\u03b8}, so the real part is 24 cos\u03b8' - 36 sin\u03b8', where \u03b8' is the angle for e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nBut since e^{-i\u03b8} is cos(-\u03b8) + i sin(-\u03b8) = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8, so \u03b8' is -\u03b8. So, for the second term, Re[(24 + 36i) e^{-i\u03b8}] = 24 cos\u03b8 - 36 sin(-\u03b8) = 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, because sin(-\u03b8) = -sin\u03b8, so 24 cos\u03b8 - 36 sin(-\u03b8) = 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo putting it together, the total real part is [300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8] + [24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8] = (300 + 24) cos\u03b8 + (-468 + 36) sin\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo now, the expression's real part is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. I need to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to \u03b8. Since \u03b8 can vary from 0 to 2\u03c0, we can treat this as a function f(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8, and find its maximum.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 can be rewritten as C cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where C = sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2) and tan\u03c6 = B/A. The maximum value of this expression is then C, because the maximum of cos is 1.\n\nWait, but in my case, it's 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8, which is A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 with A=324 and B=-432. So, the amplitude C would be sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n324 squared: 324 * 324. Hmm, 300\u00b2 is 90000, 24\u00b2 is 576, and cross term is 2*300*24=14400. So, 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 104976.\n\n432 squared: 432 * 432. Let me compute 400\u00b2 = 160000, 32\u00b2=1024, cross term 2*400*32=25600. So, 160000 + 25600 + 1024 = 186624.\n\nSo C = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600). What's sqrt(291600)? Let me see, 540\u00b2 is 291600 because 500\u00b2=250000, 40\u00b2=1600, and 2*500*40=40000. So 500\u00b2 + 2*500*40 +40\u00b2 = (500+40)^2=540\u00b2=291600. So yes, C=540.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of f(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 is 540.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, which is like A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 where B is negative. So when I write it as C cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), the maximum is C, right? Because the maximum of cosine is 1.\n\nSo the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure. So, when we have A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, the maximum is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). So in this case, A=324, B=-432.\n\nSo, sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540. So yes, the maximum is 540.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 540.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes earlier. Let me go through the steps again.\n\n1. Express z as 4e^{i\u03b8} since |z|=4.\n\n2. Then (75 +117i) z = (75+117i)*4 e^{i\u03b8} = (300 + 468i) e^{i\u03b8}.\n\n3. Then (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)/(4 e^{i\u03b8}) = (24 +36i) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\n4. The real part of the sum is Re[(300 +468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}].\n\n5. For each term, expand the real part: 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8 and 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8.\n\n6. Sum them: 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8.\n\n7. The maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2) = 540.\n\nSo, yes, everything seems correct. I think 540 is the correct maximum real part.\n",

The question is asking for the largest possible real part of the expression \\[(75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\], where \\( z \\) is a complex number with \\( |z| = 4 \\). Hmm, complex numbers can be tricky, but let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \\( z \\) is a complex number with magnitude 4. That means \\( |z| = 4 \\). I remember that for any complex number \\( z \\), \\( \\frac{1}{z} \\) is equal to \\( \\frac{\\overline{z}}{|z|^2} \\), where \\( \\overline{z} \\) is the complex conjugate of \\( z \\). Since \\( |z| = 4 \\), \\( |z|^2 = 16 \\). So, \\( \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16} \\).\n\nLet me write \\( z \\) in polar form because dealing with magnitude and angles might make things easier. So, \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), where \\( \\theta \\) is the argument of \\( z \\). Then, the conjugate \\( \\overline{z} \\) would be \\( 4e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nSubstituting into the original expression, the first term is \\( (75 + 117i)z \\). Plugging in \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), that becomes \\( (75 + 117i) \\times 4e^{i\\theta} \\). Let me compute that: 75 times 4 is 300, and 117 times 4 is 468, so it's \\( 300 + 468i \\) multiplied by \\( e^{i\\theta} \\).\n\nThe second term is \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{z} \\), which is \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}} \\). Simplifying the denominator, that's \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{4} \\times e^{-i\\theta} \\). 96 divided by 4 is 24, and 144 divided by 4 is 36, so that becomes \\( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nSo now, the entire expression becomes \\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\).

So we can focus on the real part, which is 324cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. We need to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to \u03b8.\n\nI remember that an expression of the form \\( a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta \\) can be rewritten as \\( R\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\), where \\( R = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\) and \\( \\phi = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right) \\). The maximum value of this expression is \\( R \\), so the maximum real part will be \\( R \\).\n\nWait, in our case, the expression is 324cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Let me write that as \\( a\\cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8 \\), but in our case, the coefficients are 324 for cos\u03b8 and -432 for sin\u03b8. So \\( a = 324 \\), \\( b = -432 \\).\n\nSo, \\( R = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \\). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 324^2: 324*324. Hmm, 300^2 is 90000, 24^2 is 576, and cross term is 2*300*24 = 14400. So 90000 +14400 +576 = 90000+14400=104400 +576=104,976.\n\nThen, 432^2: 400^2 is 160,000, 32^2 is 1,024, cross term is 2*400*32=25,600. So 160,000 +25,600=185,600 +1,024=186,624. But since it's (-432)^2, same as 432^2, so 186,624.\n\nSo R^2 = 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600. Therefore, R is sqrt(291,600).\n\nWhat's sqrt(291600)? Let me see: 540^2 is 291,600 because 500^2=250,000 and 540^2 = (500+40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2=250,000 +40,000 +1,600=291,600. So R=540.\n\nSo the maximum real part is 540. Therefore, the largest possible real part of the given expression is 540.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because 324 and 432 are multiples of 108, maybe I can factor that out.\n\n324 = 108 * 3, 432 = 108 * 4. So, 324 = 108*3, 432=108*4.\n\nSo R = sqrt( (108*3)^2 + (108*4)^2 ) = 108*sqrt(3^2 +4^2) = 108*sqrt(9+16)=108*sqrt(25)=108*5=540. Yep, same result. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this complex number problem to solve. The question is asking for the largest possible real part of the expression \\[(75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\], where \\( z \\) is a complex number with \\( |z| = 4 \\). Hmm, complex numbers can be tricky, but let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \\( z \\) is a complex number with magnitude 4. That means \\( |z| = 4 \\). I remember that for any complex number \\( z \\), \\( \\frac{1}{z} \\) is equal to \\( \\frac{\\overline{z}}{|z|^2} \\), where \\( \\overline{z} \\) is the complex conjugate of \\( z \\). Since \\( |z| = 4 \\), \\( |z|^2 = 16 \\).

So, \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), where \\( \\theta \\) is the argument of \\( z \\). Then, the conjugate \\( \\overline{z} \\) would be \\( 4e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nSubstituting into the original expression, the first term is \\( (75 + 117i)z \\). Plugging in \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), that becomes \\( (75 + 117i) \\times 4e^{i\\theta} \\). Let me compute that: 75 times 4 is 300, and 117 times 4 is 468, so it's \\( 300 + 468i \\) multiplied by \\( e^{i\\theta} \\).\n\nThe second term is \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{z} \\), which is \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}} \\). Simplifying the denominator, that's \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{4} \\times e^{-i\\theta} \\). 96 divided by 4 is 24, and 144 divided by 4 is 36, so that becomes \\( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nSo now, the entire expression becomes \\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\).

Hmm, 300^2 is 90000, 24^2 is 576, and cross term is 2*300*24 = 14400. So 90000 +14400 +576 = 90000+14400=104400 +576=104,976.\n\nThen, 432^2: 400^2 is 160,000, 32^2 is 1,024, cross term is 2*400*32=25,600. So 160,000 +25,600=185,600 +1,024=186,624.

Let me see: 540^2 is 291,600 because 500^2=250,000 and 540^2 = (500+40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2=250,000 +40,000 +1,600=291,600. So R=540.\n\nSo the maximum real part is 540.

Since the magnitude of \\( z \\) is 4, I can express \\( z \\) as \\( 4e^{i\\theta} \\), where \\( \\theta \\) is the argument of \\( z \\). That might make the expression easier to handle because multiplying and dividing complex numbers in polar form is straightforward.\n\nSo, substituting \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\) into the expression, let's see what happens. The first term becomes \\( (75 + 117i) \\times 4e^{i\\theta} \\). The second term is \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}} \\), which simplifies to \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{4} \\times e^{-i\\theta} \\) because dividing by \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) is the same as multiplying by \\( e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nLet me compute each part separately. Starting with the first term: \\( (75 + 117i) \\times 4e^{i\\theta} \\). Multiplying 4 into the complex number, that's \\( 300 + 468i \\) multiplied by \\( e^{i\\theta} \\). Similarly, the second term: \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{4} \\) is \\( 24 + 36i \\), so the second term becomes \\( (24 + 36i) \\times e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nSo now the expression is \\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\).

Let me add the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\n\nReal parts sum:\n\\( [300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta] + [24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta] \\)\n= \\( (300 + 24)\\cos\\theta + (-468 + 36)\\sin\\theta \\)\n= \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\)\n\nImaginary parts sum:\n\\( [300\\sin\\theta + 468\\cos\\theta] + [ -24\\sin\\theta + 36\\cos\\theta ] \\)\n= \\( (300 - 24)\\sin\\theta + (468 + 36)\\cos\\theta \\)\n= \\( 276\\sin\\theta + 504\\cos\\theta \\)\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to:\n\\( [324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta] + i[276\\sin\\theta + 504\\cos\\theta] \\)\n\nBut the problem is asking for the largest possible real part of this expression. So, we only need to focus on the real part, which is \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nLet me denote this real part as \\( R(\\theta) = 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\). We need to find the maximum value of \\( R(\\theta) \\) as \\( \\theta \\) varies over all real numbers.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form \\( a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta \\) can be rewritten using the amplitude-phase form, which is \\( R\\cos(\\theta + \\phi) \\) or \\( R\\sin(\\theta + \\phi) \\), where \\( R = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\). The maximum value of such an expression is \\( R \\), since the cosine and sine functions have a maximum of 1.\n\nWait, in this case, the expression is \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\). So, the coefficients are \\( a = 324 \\) and \\( b = -432 \\). Therefore, the amplitude \\( R \\) is \\( \\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \\).\n\nLet me compute that. First, compute \\( 324^2 \\) and \\( 432^2 \\).\n\n324 squared: 324 * 324. Let's calculate that. 300^2 is 90,000, 24^2 is 576, and the cross term is 2*300*24=14,400. So, (300 +24)^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432 squared: Let's break it down. 400^2 is 160,000. 32^2 is 1,024. The cross term is 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400 +32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.\n\nSo, \\( R = \\sqrt{104,976 + 186,624} \\).\n\nAdding those together: 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.\n\nSo, \\( R = \\sqrt{291,600} \\). Let's compute that. What's the square of 540? 540^2 = 291,600. So, \\( R = 540 \\).\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of \\( R(\\theta) \\) is 540.\n\nWait, but I should double-check that. Since \\( R(\\theta) = a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta \\), the maximum is indeed \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\). So, in this case, \\( a = 324 \\), \\( b = -432 \\), so yes, \\( R = \\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = 540 \\).\n\nHence, the largest possible real part of the given expression is 540.\n\nBut wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations earlier. Let me retrace my steps.\n\nWe started with \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), substituted into the expression, expanded, and found the real part. Then, we expressed it as a linear combination of sine and cosine and found its maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to handle this without getting into trigonometric expansions. Maybe by using complex conjugates or something else.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me denote \\( w = z \\). Since \\( |z| = 4 \\), then \\( \\overline{z} = \\frac{z}{|z|^2} = \\frac{z}{16} \\). So, \\( \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16} \\).\n\nSo, the expression becomes \\( (75 + 117i)w + \\frac{96 + 144i}{w} \\).\n\nBut \\( \\frac{1}{w} = \\frac{\\overline{w}}{16} \\), so substituting that in, the expression becomes \\( (75 + 117i)w + \\frac{96 + 144i}{16}\\overline{w} \\).\n\nSimplify \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{16} \\): 96/16=6, 144/16=9. So, that's \\( 6 + 9i \\).\n\nSo, the expression is \\( (75 + 117i)w + (6 + 9i)\\overline{w} \\).\n\nNow, since \\( w = z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), then \\( \\overline{w} = 4e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this expression in terms of \\( w + \\overline{w} \\) and \\( w - \\overline{w} \\), which are related to \\( 2\\Re(w) \\) and \\( 2i\\Im(w) \\), respectively.\n\nBut maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, since I have \\( w \\) and \\( \\overline{w} \\), perhaps I can consider the expression as a linear combination of \\( w \\) and \\( \\overline{w} \\), and then use the fact that for any complex number \\( w \\) with \\( |w| = 4 \\), we can write \\( w = 4e^{i\\theta} \\) and \\( \\overline{w} = 4e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nBut perhaps another way is to let \\( w = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), so \\( \\overline{w} = 4e^{-i\\theta} \\), and then express the entire expression in terms of \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) and \\( e^{-i\\theta} \\), then group terms.\n\nWait, perhaps let me try that.\n\nThe expression is \\( (75 + 117i)w + (6 + 9i)\\overline{w} \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( w = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), \\( \\overline{w} = 4e^{-i\\theta} \\), we get:\n\n= \\( (75 + 117i)4e^{i\\theta} + (6 + 9i)4e^{-i\\theta} \\)\n= \\( 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} + 4(6 + 9i)e^{-i\\theta} \\)\n= \\( 4 \\times [ (75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} + (6 + 9i)e^{-i\\theta} ] \\)\n\nHmm, but this seems similar to the approach I took earlier. So perhaps the initial approach was correct.\n\nAlternatively, another thought: since the expression is linear in \\( w \\) and \\( \\overline{w} \\), perhaps I can write it as \\( A w + B \\overline{w} \\), where \\( A = 75 + 117i \\) and \\( B = 6 + 9i \\). Then, the real part of this expression would be the real part of \\( A w + B \\overline{w} \\).\n\nWait, but \\( w = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), so \\( \\overline{w} = 4e^{-i\\theta} \\). So, substituting these, the expression becomes \\( A \\times 4e^{i\\theta} + B \\times 4e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nBut perhaps I can factor the 4 out: \\( 4 [ A e^{i\\theta} + B e^{-i\\theta} ] \\). Then, the real part would be 4 times the real part of \\( A e^{i\\theta} + B e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express this as \\( 4 [ A e^{i\\theta} + B e^{-i\\theta} ] \\), and then find the real part.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can compute \\( A e^{i\\theta} + B e^{-i\\theta} \\) as follows:\n\nLet me write \\( A = a + ib \\), \\( B = c + id \\), so \\( A e^{i\\theta} = (a + ib)(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta) \\) and \\( B e^{-i\\theta} = (c + id)(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta) \\).\n\nMultiplying these out:\n\n\\( A e^{i\\theta} = a\\cos\\theta - b\\sin\\theta + i(a\\sin\\theta + b\\cos\\theta) \\)\n\\( B e^{-i\\theta} = c\\cos\\theta + d\\sin\\theta + i(-c\\sin\\theta + d\\cos\\theta) \\)\n\nAdding these together:\n\nReal parts: \\( a\\cos\\theta - b\\sin\\theta + c\\cos\\theta + d\\sin\\theta \\)\nImaginary parts: \\( a\\sin\\theta + b\\cos\\theta - c\\sin\\theta + d\\cos\\theta \\)\n\nSo, grouping:\n\nReal: \\( (a + c)\\cos\\theta + (-b + d)\\sin\\theta \\)\nImaginary: \\( (a - c)\\sin\\theta + (b + d)\\cos\\theta \\)\n\nSo, the real part of \\( A e^{i\\theta} + B e^{-i\\theta} \\) is \\( (a + c)\\cos\\theta + (-b + d)\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nTherefore, the real part of the entire expression is \\( 4 \\times [ (a + c)\\cos\\theta + (-b + d)\\sin\\theta ] \\).\n\nIn our case, \\( A = 75 + 117i \\), so \\( a = 75 \\), \\( b = 117 \\); and \\( B = 6 + 9i \\), so \\( c = 6 \\), \\( d = 9 \\).\n\nSubstituting:\n\nReal part of \\( A e^{i\\theta} + B e^{-i\\theta} \\) is \\( (75 + 6)\\cos\\theta + (-117 + 9)\\sin\\theta = 81\\cos\\theta - 108\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nTherefore, the real part of the entire expression is \\( 4 \\times (81\\cos\\theta - 108\\sin\\theta) = 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\), which matches what I found earlier. So that's consistent.\n\nSo, the real part is \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\), and the maximum of this is \\( \\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = 540 \\), as I found before.\n\nBut let me just think again: is there any possibility that I've missed a step or made a miscalculation? Let me double-check the coefficients.\n\nWait, in the expression \\( (75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z} \\), when I substituted \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), I correctly computed the second term as \\( (96 + 144i)/(4e^{i\\theta}) = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\). Then, when expanding, I got the real parts and imaginary parts correctly.\n\nThen, when combining, I correctly summed the real parts and the imaginary parts, which led me to the real part being \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nAnother way to compute the maximum of this expression is to recognize that \\( a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta \\) can be written as \\( R\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\), where \\( R = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\), and \\( \\phi = \\arctan(b/a) \\) or something like that. The maximum of this is \\( R \\), as cosine varies between -1 and 1.\n\nSo, in our case, \\( a = 324 \\), \\( b = -432 \\). Therefore, \\( R = \\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \\). As I computed earlier, that's \\( \\sqrt{104,976 + 186,624} = \\sqrt{291,600} = 540 \\).\n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure that I correctly accounted for the fact that the expression is \\( (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z \\). When I substituted \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), I correctly wrote \\( 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\\theta} \\), so the second term becomes \\( (96 + 144i)(1/(4e^{i\\theta})) = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this problem using vectors or inner products. Since \\( z \\) is a complex number with magnitude 4, the expression can be thought of as a linear combination of \\( z \\) and \\( 1/z \\), with coefficients being complex numbers.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps using the identity \\( \\text{Re}(A z + B / z) = \\text{Re}(A z) + \\text{Re}(B / z) \\). Since the real part is linear, I can separate the real parts.\n\nBut perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider \\( A z + B / z \\) as a function and find its real part's maximum using calculus or optimization techniques. But since \\( |z|=4 \\), perhaps using Lagrange multipliers, but that might be overkill.\n\nWait, but maybe I can parametrize \\( z \\) as \\( 4e^{i\\theta} \\) as I did earlier, and then compute the real part as a function of \\( \\theta \\), then find its maximum using calculus. So, \\( R(\\theta) = 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nTo find the maximum, we can take the derivative of \\( R(\\theta) \\) with respect to \\( \\theta \\), set it to zero, and solve for \\( \\theta \\).\n\nSo, \\( dR/d\\theta = -324\\sin\\theta - 432\\cos\\theta \\). Setting this equal to zero:\n\n-324 sin\u03b8 - 432 cos\u03b8 = 0\n\nDividing both sides by -36 to simplify:\n\n9 sin\u03b8 + 12 cos\u03b8 = 0\n\nSo, 9 sin\u03b8 = -12 cos\u03b8\n\nDivide both sides by cos\u03b8 (assuming cos\u03b8 \u2260 0):\n\n9 tan\u03b8 = -12\n\ntan\u03b8 = -12/9 = -4/3\n\nSo, \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3). But since tan is periodic every \u03c0, the general solution is \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3) + k\u03c0, where k is integer.\n\nBut since the maximum occurs at a specific \u03b8, we can compute R(\u03b8) at \u03b8 where tan\u03b8 = -4/3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the maximum using the amplitude method as before.\n\nBut regardless, the maximum value is 540 as previously found.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there any possibility that the maximum real part could be larger than 540? Or did I make a mistake in the substitution steps?\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps express the entire expression as a complex number and then find its real part.\n\nBut since I already have the real part as \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\), and its maximum is 540, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check with specific values of \u03b8. For example, if I set \u03b8 such that \\( \\cos\\theta = 324/(540) \\) and \\( \\sin\\theta = -432/(540) \\), which would correspond to the angle where the expression reaches its maximum.\n\nWait, let me compute those values:\n\ncos\u03b8 = 324 / 540 = 0.6\n\nsin\u03b8 = -432 / 540 = -0.8\n\nSo, \u03b8 would be in the fourth quadrant, with cos\u03b8=0.6 and sin\u03b8=-0.8, which is indeed consistent with tan\u03b8 = -4/3, as earlier.\n\nSo, plugging \u03b8 where cos\u03b8=0.6 and sin\u03b8=-0.8 into R(\u03b8):\n\nR(\u03b8) = 324*(0.6) - 432*(-0.8) = 324*0.6 + 432*0.8\n\nCompute 324*0.6: 324 * 0.6 = 194.4\n\nCompute 432*0.8: 432 * 0.8 = 345.6\n\nSum: 194.4 + 345.6 = 540\n\nPerfect, that checks out.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the maximum real part is 540.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this complex number problem to solve. The question is asking for the largest possible real part of the expression \\[(75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\], where \\( z \\) is a complex number with \\( |z| = 4 \\). Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that any complex number \\( z \\) can be written in polar form. Since the magnitude of \\( z \\) is 4, I can express \\( z \\) as \\( 4e^{i\\theta} \\), where \\( \\theta \\) is the argument of \\( z \\). That might make the expression easier to handle because multiplying and dividing complex numbers in polar form is straightforward.\n\nSo, substituting \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\) into the expression, let's see what happens. The first term becomes \\( (75 + 117i) \\times 4e^{i\\theta} \\). The second term is \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}} \\), which simplifies to \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{4} \\times e^{-i\\theta} \\) because dividing by \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) is the same as multiplying by \\( e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nLet me compute each part separately. Starting with the first term: \\( (75 + 117i) \\times 4e^{i\\theta} \\). Multiplying 4 into the complex number, that's \\( 300 + 468i \\) multiplied by \\( e^{i\\theta} \\). Similarly, the second term: \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{4} \\) is \\( 24 + 36i \\), so the second term becomes \\( (24 + 36i) \\times e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nSo now the expression is \\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\). Hmm, I think I can write this in terms of sine and cosine by expanding the exponentials. Remembering that \\( e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta \\) and \\( e^{-i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\nFirst term expansion:\n\\( (300 + 468i)(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta) \\)\n= \\( 300\\cos\\theta + 300i\\sin\\theta + 468i\\cos\\theta + 468i^2\\sin\\theta \\)\nSince \\( i^2 = -1 \\), this becomes:\n\\( 300\\cos\\theta + (300\\sin\\theta + 468\\cos\\theta)i - 468\\sin\\theta \\)\nSo, grouping real and imaginary parts:\nReal: \\( 300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta \\)\nImaginary: \\( 300\\sin\\theta + 468\\cos\\theta \\)\n\nSecond term expansion:\n\\( (24 + 36i)(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta) \\)\n= \\( 24\\cos\\theta - 24i\\sin\\theta + 36i\\cos\\theta - 36i^2\\sin\\theta \\)\nAgain, \\( i^2 = -1 \\), so:\n\\( 24\\cos\\theta + ( -24\\sin\\theta + 36\\cos\\theta )i + 36\\sin\\theta \\)\nGrouping real and imaginary parts:\nReal: \\( 24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta \\)\nImaginary: \\( -24\\sin\\theta + 36\\cos\\theta \\)\n\nNow, adding the two expanded terms together. Let me add the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\n\nReal parts sum:\n\\( [300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta] + [24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta] \\)\n= \\( (300 + 24)\\cos\\theta + (-468 + 36)\\sin\\theta \\)\n= \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\)\n\nImaginary parts sum:\n\\( [300\\sin\\theta + 468\\cos\\theta] + [ -24\\sin\\theta + 36\\cos\\theta ] \\)\n= \\( (300 - 24)\\sin\\theta + (468 + 36)\\cos\\theta \\)\n= \\( 276\\sin\\theta + 504\\cos\\theta \\)\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to:\n\\( [324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta] + i[276\\sin\\theta + 504\\cos\\theta] \\)\n\nBut the problem is asking for the largest possible real part of this expression. So, we only need to focus on the real part, which is \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nLet me denote this real part as \\( R(\\theta) = 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\). We need to find the maximum value of \\( R(\\theta) \\) as \\( \\theta \\) varies over all real numbers.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form \\( a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta \\) can be rewritten using the amplitude-phase form, which is \\( R\\cos(\\theta + \\phi) \\) or \\( R\\sin(\\theta + \\phi) \\), where \\( R = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\). The maximum value of such an expression is \\( R \\), since the cosine and sine functions have a maximum of 1.\n\nWait, in this case, the expression is \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\). So, the coefficients are \\( a = 324 \\) and \\( b = -432 \\). Therefore, the amplitude \\( R \\) is \\( \\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \\).\n\nLet me compute that. First, compute \\( 324^2 \\) and \\( 432^2 \\).\n\n324 squared: 324 * 324. Let's calculate that. 300^2 is 90,000, 24^2 is 576, and the cross term is 2*300*24=14,400. So, (300 +24)^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432 squared: Let's break it down. 400^2 is 160,000. 32^2 is 1,024. The cross term is 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400 +32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.\n\nSo, \\( R = \\sqrt{104,976 + 186,624} \\).\n\nAdding those together: 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.\n\nSo, \\( R = \\sqrt{291,600} \\). Let's compute that. What's the square of 540? 540^2 = 291,600. So, \\( R = 540 \\).\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of \\( R(\\theta) \\) is 540.\n\nWait, but I should double-check that. Since \\( R(\\theta) = a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta \\), the maximum is indeed \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\). So, in this case, \\( a = 324 \\), \\( b = -432 \\), so yes, \\( R = \\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = 540 \\).\n\nHence, the largest possible real part of the given expression is 540.\n\nBut wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations earlier. Let me retrace my steps.\n\nWe started with \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), substituted into the expression, expanded, and found the real part. Then, we expressed it as a linear combination of sine and cosine and found its maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to handle this without getting into trigonometric expansions. Maybe by using complex conjugates or something else.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me denote \\( w = z \\). Since \\( |z| = 4 \\), then \\( \\overline{z} = \\frac{z}{|z|^2} = \\frac{z}{16} \\). So, \\( \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16} \\).\n\nSo, the expression becomes \\( (75 + 117i)w + \\frac{96 + 144i}{w} \\).\n\nBut \\( \\frac{1}{w} = \\frac{\\overline{w}}{16} \\), so substituting that in, the expression becomes \\( (75 + 117i)w + \\frac{96 + 144i}{16}\\overline{w} \\).\n\nSimplify \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{16} \\): 96/16=6, 144/16=9. So, that's \\( 6 + 9i \\).\n\nSo, the expression is \\( (75 + 117i)w + (6 + 9i)\\overline{w} \\).\n\nNow, since \\( w = z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), then \\( \\overline{w} = 4e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this expression in terms of \\( w + \\overline{w} \\) and \\( w - \\overline{w} \\), which are related to \\( 2\\Re(w) \\) and \\( 2i\\Im(w) \\), respectively.\n\nBut maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, since I have \\( w \\) and \\( \\overline{w} \\), perhaps I can consider the expression as a linear combination of \\( w \\) and \\( \\overline{w} \\), and then use the fact that for any complex number \\( w \\) with \\( |w| = 4 \\), we can write \\( w = 4e^{i\\theta} \\) and \\( \\overline{w} = 4e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nBut perhaps another way is to let \\( w = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), so \\( \\overline{w} = 4e^{-i\\theta} \\), and then express the entire expression in terms of \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) and \\( e^{-i\\theta} \\), then group terms.\n\nWait, perhaps let me try that.\n\nThe expression is \\( (75 + 117i)w + (6 + 9i)\\overline{w} \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( w = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), \\( \\overline{w} = 4e^{-i\\theta} \\), we get:\n\n= \\( (75 + 117i)4e^{i\\theta} + (6 + 9i)4e^{-i\\theta} \\)\n= \\( 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} + 4(6 + 9i)e^{-i\\theta} \\)\n= \\( 4 \\times [ (75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} + (6 + 9i)e^{-i\\theta} ] \\)\n\nHmm, but this seems similar to the approach I took earlier. So perhaps the initial approach was correct.\n\nAlternatively, another thought: since the expression is linear in \\( w \\) and \\( \\overline{w} \\), perhaps I can write it as \\( A w + B \\overline{w} \\), where \\( A = 75 + 117i \\) and \\( B = 6 + 9i \\). Then, the real part of this expression would be the real part of \\( A w + B \\overline{w} \\).\n\nWait, but \\( w = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), so \\( \\overline{w} = 4e^{-i\\theta} \\). So, substituting these, the expression becomes \\( A \\times 4e^{i\\theta} + B \\times 4e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nBut perhaps I can factor the 4 out: \\( 4 [ A e^{i\\theta} + B e^{-i\\theta} ] \\). Then, the real part would be 4 times the real part of \\( A e^{i\\theta} + B e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express this as \\( 4 [ A e^{i\\theta} + B e^{-i\\theta} ] \\), and then find the real part.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can compute \\( A e^{i\\theta} + B e^{-i\\theta} \\) as follows:\n\nLet me write \\( A = a + ib \\), \\( B = c + id \\), so \\( A e^{i\\theta} = (a + ib)(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta) \\) and \\( B e^{-i\\theta} = (c + id)(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta) \\).\n\nMultiplying these out:\n\n\\( A e^{i\\theta} = a\\cos\\theta - b\\sin\\theta + i(a\\sin\\theta + b\\cos\\theta) \\)\n\\( B e^{-i\\theta} = c\\cos\\theta + d\\sin\\theta + i(-c\\sin\\theta + d\\cos\\theta) \\)\n\nAdding these together:\n\nReal parts: \\( a\\cos\\theta - b\\sin\\theta + c\\cos\\theta + d\\sin\\theta \\)\nImaginary parts: \\( a\\sin\\theta + b\\cos\\theta - c\\sin\\theta + d\\cos\\theta \\)\n\nSo, grouping:\n\nReal: \\( (a + c)\\cos\\theta + (-b + d)\\sin\\theta \\)\nImaginary: \\( (a - c)\\sin\\theta + (b + d)\\cos\\theta \\)\n\nSo, the real part of \\( A e^{i\\theta} + B e^{-i\\theta} \\) is \\( (a + c)\\cos\\theta + (-b + d)\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nTherefore, the real part of the entire expression is \\( 4 \\times [ (a + c)\\cos\\theta + (-b + d)\\sin\\theta ] \\).\n\nIn our case, \\( A = 75 + 117i \\), so \\( a = 75 \\), \\( b = 117 \\); and \\( B = 6 + 9i \\), so \\( c = 6 \\), \\( d = 9 \\).\n\nSubstituting:\n\nReal part of \\( A e^{i\\theta} + B e^{-i\\theta} \\) is \\( (75 + 6)\\cos\\theta + (-117 + 9)\\sin\\theta = 81\\cos\\theta - 108\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nTherefore, the real part of the entire expression is \\( 4 \\times (81\\cos\\theta - 108\\sin\\theta) = 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\), which matches what I found earlier.

But since \\( |z|=4 \\), perhaps using Lagrange multipliers, but that might be overkill.\n\nWait, but maybe I can parametrize \\( z \\) as \\( 4e^{i\\theta} \\) as I did earlier, and then compute the real part as a function of \\( \\theta \\), then find its maximum using calculus. So, \\( R(\\theta) = 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nTo find the maximum, we can take the derivative of \\( R(\\theta) \\) with respect to \\( \\theta \\), set it to zero, and solve for \\( \\theta \\).\n\nSo, \\( dR/d\\theta = -324\\sin\\theta - 432\\cos\\theta \\). Setting this equal to zero:\n\n-324 sin\u03b8 - 432 cos\u03b8 = 0\n\nDividing both sides by -36 to simplify:\n\n9 sin\u03b8 + 12 cos\u03b8 = 0\n\nSo, 9 sin\u03b8 = -12 cos\u03b8\n\nDivide both sides by cos\u03b8 (assuming cos\u03b8 \u2260 0):\n\n9 tan\u03b8 = -12\n\ntan\u03b8 = -12/9 = -4/3\n\nSo, \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3). But since tan is periodic every \u03c0, the general solution is \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3) + k\u03c0, where k is integer.\n\nBut since the maximum occurs at a specific \u03b8, we can compute R(\u03b8) at \u03b8 where tan\u03b8 = -4/3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the maximum using the amplitude method as before.\n\nBut regardless, the maximum value is 540 as previously found.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there any possibility that the maximum real part could be larger than 540? Or did I make a mistake in the substitution steps?\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps express the entire expression as a complex number and then find its real part.\n\nBut since I already have the real part as \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\), and its maximum is 540, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check with specific values of \u03b8. For example, if I set \u03b8 such that \\( \\cos\\theta = 324/(540) \\) and \\( \\sin\\theta = -432/(540) \\), which would correspond to the angle where the expression reaches its maximum.\n\nWait, let me compute those values:\n\ncos\u03b8 = 324 / 540 = 0.6\n\nsin\u03b8 = -432 / 540 = -0.8\n\nSo, \u03b8 would be in the fourth quadrant, with cos\u03b8=0.6 and sin\u03b8=-0.8, which is indeed consistent with tan\u03b8 = -4/3, as earlier.\n\nSo, plugging \u03b8 where cos\u03b8=0.6 and sin\u03b8=-0.8 into R(\u03b8):\n\nR(\u03b8) = 324*(0.6) - 432*(-0.8) = 324*0.6 + 432*0.8\n\nCompute 324*0.6: 324 * 0.6 = 194.4\n\nCompute 432*0.8: 432 * 0.8 = 345.6\n\nSum: 194.4 + 345.6 = 540\n\nPerfect, that checks out.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the maximum real part is 540.\n\n\nTo find the largest possible real part of the expression \\((75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\) where \\(z\\) is a complex number with \\(|z| = 4\\), we start by expressing \\(z\\) in polar form as \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is the argument of \\(z\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\) into the expression, we rewrite it as:\n\\[\n(75 + 117i) \\cdot 4e^{i\\theta} + \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}}\n\\]\nSimplifying each term:\n\\[\n(300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\n\\]\nExpanding using \\(e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta\\) and \\(e^{-i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta\\), we separate the real and imaginary parts. After combining like terms, the real part of the expression becomes:\n\\[\n324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta\n\\]\nTo find the maximum value of this expression, we recognize it as a linear combination of sine and cosine. The maximum value of \\(a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta\\) is \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\). Here, \\(a = 324\\) and \\(b = -432\\), so:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \\sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \\sqrt{291600} = 540\n\\]\nThus, the largest possible real part of the given expression is \\(\\boxed{540}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that for any complex number z, if |z| = 4, then z can be written in the form z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. That might be helpful because it can simplify the expression.\n\nWait, actually, another thought: maybe I can represent z as 4 times some complex number on the unit circle. So, z = 4e^{i\u03b8} where \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0. That could make things easier since the modulus is fixed.\n\nLet me write down the expression again: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. If z has modulus 4, then 1/z is (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}, because the reciprocal of z is the conjugate of z divided by |z| squared. Since |z| is 4, |z| squared is 16, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, substituting z = 4e^{i\u03b8} into the expression, the first term becomes (75 + 117i)*4e^{i\u03b8}, and the second term becomes (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nLet me compute each part separately.\n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{i\u03b8}.\n\nSecond term: (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 + 36i)*e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo the entire expression is 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)*e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nNow, maybe I can write each of these terms in terms of sine and cosine. Because e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8, and e^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8.\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst, compute 4*(75 + 117i). That's 4*75 = 300 and 4*117 = 468. So, 4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i.\n\nSimilarly, 24 + 36i is just 24 + 36i.\n\nSo now, the expression becomes (300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) + (24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8).\n\nLet me multiply these out.\n\nFirst, expand (300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8):\n\n= 300 cos\u03b8 + 300 i sin\u03b8 + 468i cos\u03b8 + 468i^2 sin\u03b8\n\nBut i^2 is -1, so 468i^2 sin\u03b8 = -468 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n= (300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8) + i (300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8)\n\nSimilarly, expand (24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8):\n\n= 24 cos\u03b8 -24 i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 -36i^2 sin\u03b8\n\nAgain, i^2 is -1, so -36i^2 sin\u03b8 = 36 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n= (24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8) + i (-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8)\n\nNow, adding the two expanded parts together:\n\nReal parts: (300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8) + (24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8)\n\nImaginary parts: (300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8) + (-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8)\n\nSo, combining real parts:\n\n300 cos\u03b8 + 24 cos\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8\n\n-468 sin\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8 = (-432 sin\u03b8)\n\nSo, real part is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary part:\n\n300 sin\u03b8 -24 sin\u03b8 = 276 sin\u03b8\n\n468 cos\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8 = 504 cos\u03b8\n\nSo, imaginary part is 276 sin\u03b8 + 504 cos\u03b8.\n\nBut since we're only interested in the real part of the entire expression, we can focus on the real part, which is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, so the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. I need to find the maximum value of this expression as \u03b8 varies.\n\nHmm, how do I find the maximum of an expression like A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8? I remember that the maximum is sqrt(A^2 + B^2). Wait, but in this case, it's 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8, so the coefficients are 324 and -432.\n\nSo, if I have something like C cos\u03b8 + D sin\u03b8, the maximum is sqrt(C^2 + D^2). So, in this case, C is 324, D is -432.\n\nWait, but the maximum of C cos\u03b8 + D sin\u03b8 is sqrt(C^2 + D^2). So, let me compute that.\n\nCompute sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2). Let's compute each square:\n\n324^2: 324 * 324. Hmm, 300^2 is 90000, 24^2 is 576, and cross term 2*300*24=14400. So, (300+24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000+14400=104400; 104400+576=104,976.\n\nSimilarly, (-432)^2 is 432^2. Let's compute 400^2 = 160000, 32^2=1024, cross term 2*400*32=25600.\n\nSo, (400+32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 +32^2 = 160000 + 25600 + 1024.\n\n160000 +25600=185600; 185600 +1024=186,624.\n\nSo, 324^2 + (-432)^2 = 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.\n\nSo, sqrt(291,600). Let me compute sqrt(291600). Hmm, sqrt(291600) is 540, since 540^2 = 291,600. Let me check: 500^2=250,000, 540^2= (500+40)^2=500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2=250,000 +40,000 +1,600=291,600. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss any constants or miscalculate earlier.\n\nWait, the expression after substitution was (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}. Then, when I expanded, I think I correctly expanded each part.\n\nThen, when I combined real parts, 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8 +24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8, which gives 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. That seems correct.\n\nThen, when I considered the maximum of 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, I used the formula that the maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is sqrt(A^2 + B^2). So, with A=324, B=-432, the maximum is sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2)=sqrt(104,976 + 186,624)=sqrt(291,600)=540. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible real part is 540.\n\nWait, but another thought: when I substituted z =4e^{i\u03b8}, I could have alternatively let z =4e^{i\u03b8}, and 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}, which I did. Then, I think that part is correct.\n\nAlternatively, could I have approached this problem differently? Maybe using complex conjugates or something else?\n\nAnother approach: Let me denote w = z /4, so that |w|=1. Then, z =4w, and 1/z = (1/4)w^{-1}.\n\nSo, the original expression becomes (75 +117i)(4w) + (96 +144i)(1/(4w)).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(75+117i)*4w = 4*(75+117i)w = (300 +468i)w.\n\n(96 +144i)/(4w) = (24 +36i)/w.\n\nSo, the expression is (300 +468i)w + (24 +36i)/w.\n\nNow, since w is a complex number with |w|=1, so w = e^{i\u03b8}, and 1/w = e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, the expression becomes (300 +468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nWhich is exactly what I had earlier. So, same as before.\n\nSo, the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, which has maximum 540.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that 540 is the correct answer.\n",

Then, when I expanded, I think I correctly expanded each part.\n\nThen, when I combined real parts, 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8 +24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8, which gives 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. That seems correct.\n\nThen, when I considered the maximum of 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, I used the formula that the maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is sqrt(A^2 + B^2). So, with A=324, B=-432, the maximum is sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2)=sqrt(104,976 + 186,624)=sqrt(291,600)=540. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible real part is 540.\n\nWait, but another thought: when I substituted z =4e^{i\u03b8}, I could have alternatively let z =4e^{i\u03b8}, and 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}, which I did. Then, I think that part is correct.\n\nAlternatively, could I have approached this problem differently? Maybe using complex conjugates or something else?\n\nAnother approach: Let me denote w = z /4, so that |w|=1. Then, z =4w, and 1/z = (1/4)w^{-1}.\n\nSo, the original expression becomes (75 +117i)(4w) + (96 +144i)(1/(4w)).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(75+117i)*4w = 4*(75+117i)w = (300 +468i)w.\n\n(96 +144i)/(4w) = (24 +36i)/w.\n\nSo, the expression is (300 +468i)w + (24 +36i)/w.\n\nNow, since w is a complex number with |w|=1, so w = e^{i\u03b8}, and 1/w = e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, the expression becomes (300 +468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nWhich is exactly what I had earlier. So, same as before.\n\nSo, the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, which has maximum 540.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that 540 is the correct answer.\n\n\nTo find the largest possible real part of the expression \\((75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\) where \\(|z| = 4\\), we start by expressing \\(z\\) as \\(4e^{i\\theta}\\) since \\(|z| = 4\\). Substituting \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta}\\) into the expression, we simplify each term:\n\n1. \\((75 + 117i) \\cdot 4e^{i\\theta} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta}\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\\)\n\nExpanding these using Euler's formula \\(e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta\\) and \\(e^{-i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta\\), we combine the real parts:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Real part} = (300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta) + (24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta) = 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta\n\\]\n\nThe maximum value of \\(A\\cos\\theta + B\\sin\\theta\\) is \\(\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\\). Here, \\(A = 324\\) and \\(B = -432\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \\sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \\sqrt{291600} = 540\n\\]\n\nThus, the largest possible real part is \\(\\boxed{540}\\).",

So \\( z \\) is a complex number, and its magnitude is 4. That means \\( z \\) lies on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4 centered at the origin. So \\( z \\) can be written in the form \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\) where \\( \\theta \\) is the argument of \\( z \\).\n\nBut maybe I don't need to represent \\( z \\) in polar form right away. Let me think about the expression given.\n\nThe expression is \\( (75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z} \\). I need to find the maximum real part of this expression. So, I need to compute the real part of this expression and then find its maximum value.\n\nLet me denote \\( z \\) as \\( x + yi \\), where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are real numbers. But since \\( |z| = 4 \\), we have \\( x^2 + y^2 = 16 \\).\n\nWait, but maybe working with polar form is better here. Let me try that approach. So, \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), and \\( 1/z = \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nSo, substituting into the expression:\n\n\\( (75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i) \\times 4e^{i\\theta} \\)\n\nand\n\n\\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (96 + 144i) \\times \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nLet me compute each part separately.\n\nFirst, compute \\( (75 + 117i) \\times 4 \\). Let's see, 75 times 4 is 300, and 117 times 4 is 468. So this becomes \\( 300 + 468i \\).\n\nSo, \\( (75 + 117i)z = (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} \\).\n\nSimilarly, compute \\( (96 + 144i) \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\). 96 divided by 4 is 24, and 144 divided by 4 is 36. So that's \\( 24 + 36i \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nNow, the entire expression becomes:\n\n\\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nI need to find the real part of this sum. So, let's compute each term's real part and then add them.\n\nLet me denote \\( A = 300 + 468i \\) and \\( B = 24 + 36i \\).

Hmm, so I need to think differently.\n\nWait, more accurately, for a complex number \\( C = a + bi \\), Re\\( (C e^{i\\theta} ) = a \\cos\\theta - b \\sin\\theta \\). Because \\( e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i \\sin\\theta \\), so when you multiply \\( C \\) and \\( e^{i\\theta} \\), the real part is \\( a \\cos\\theta - b \\sin\\theta \\) (since the imaginary parts contribute to the imaginary part).\n\nSimilarly, Re\\( (C e^{-i\\theta} ) = a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta \\), because \\( e^{-i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta - i \\sin\\theta \\).\n\nSo, for each term:\n\nRe\\( (A e^{i\\theta} ) = 300 \\cos\\theta - 468 \\sin\\theta \\).\n\nRe\\( (B e^{-i\\theta} ) = 24 \\cos\\theta + 36 \\sin\\theta \\).\n\nSo the total real part is:\n\n\\( (300 \\cos\\theta - 468 \\sin\\theta) + (24 \\cos\\theta + 36 \\sin\\theta) \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( (300 + 24) \\cos\\theta + (-468 + 36) \\sin\\theta \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( 324 \\cos\\theta - 432 \\sin\\theta \\).\n\nWait, 300 +24 is 324, and -468 +36 is -432. So, the real part is \\( 324 \\cos\\theta - 432 \\sin\\theta \\).\n\nNow, I need to find the maximum value of this expression as \\( \\theta \\) varies. So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum of \\( 324 \\cos\\theta - 432 \\sin\\theta \\).\n\nHmm, I remember that expressions of the form \\( a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta \\) can be rewritten as \\( R \\cos(\\theta + \\phi) \\), where \\( R = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\) and \\( \\phi \\) is some phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is \\( R \\), since the maximum of cosine is 1.\n\nWait, but in this case, the expression is \\( 324 \\cos\\theta - 432 \\sin\\theta \\). So, it's similar to \\( a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta \\), but with a negative sign on the sine term.\n\nSo, let me consider the expression \\( a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta \\). The maximum is \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\). Similarly, for \\( a \\cos\\theta - b \\sin\\theta \\), the maximum is \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\) as well. Because when you express it as \\( R \\cos(\\theta + \\phi) \\), the amplitude is \\( R \\), which is \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\).\n\nSo, in this case, \\( a = 324 \\) and \\( b = -432 \\). Wait, no, because the expression is \\( 324 \\cos\\theta - 432 \\sin\\theta \\), which is equivalent to \\( 324 \\cos\\theta + (-432) \\sin\\theta \\). So, \\( a = 324 \\), \\( b = -432 \\).\n\nSo, the maximum value is \\( \\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \\).\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 324 squared:\n\n324^2: Let's compute 300^2 = 90000, 24^2 = 576, and the cross term is 2 * 300 *24= 14400. So, (300 +24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000+14400=104400 +576=104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432^2: Let's compute 400^2=160000, 32^2=1024, and 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400+32)^2 = 160000 + 25600 + 1024 = 160000+25600=185600 +1024=186,624.\n\nSo, 324^2 is 104,976, and (-432)^2 is 186,624. Adding these together: 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.\n\nSo, \\( \\sqrt{291,600} \\).\n\nWhat's the square of 540? 540^2 = (500 +40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. Oh, perfect! So, the square root is 540.\n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, 324 squared: 324 *324. Let me compute it again.\n\n324 * 324: Let me compute 300 * 300 =90,000, 300*24=7,200, 24*300=7,200, 24*24=576.\n\nWait, but 324 *324 is (300 +24)(300 +24) = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 =90,000 +14,400 +576= 90,000+14,400=104,400 +576=104,976. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, 432^2: 432*432. Let me compute it as (400+32)^2=400^2 +2*400*32 +32^2=160,000 +25,600 +1,024=160,000+25,600=185,600 +1,024=186,624. So that's correct.\n\nSo sum is 104,976 +186,624=291,600. Square root is 540, yes.\n\nSo, the maximum value of the real part is 540.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I applied the correct formula. The expression is \\( a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta \\), whose maximum is \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\).\n\nIn this case, the expression is \\( 324 \\cos\\theta - 432 \\sin\\theta \\), which can be written as \\( 324 \\cos\\theta + (-432) \\sin\\theta \\). So yes, \\( a =324 \\), \\( b= -432 \\), so the maximum is \\( \\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = 540 \\).\n\nSo, I think that's the answer. The largest possible real part is 540.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial steps.\n\nWait, so the original expression is \\( (75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z} \\).\n\nI represented \\( z =4 e^{i\\theta} \\), so \\( 1/z = (1/4) e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n\\( (75 +117i)*4 e^{i\\theta} = (300 + 468i) e^{i\\theta} \\).\n\nAnd \\( (96 +144i)/(4) e^{-i\\theta} = (24 +36i) e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nThen, the real parts:\n\nFor \\( (300 + 468i) e^{i\\theta} \\), the real part is \\( 300 \\cos\\theta - 468 \\sin\\theta \\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\( (24 +36i) e^{-i\\theta} \\), the real part is \\( 24 \\cos\\theta +36 \\sin\\theta \\).\n\nAdding these gives \\( 324 \\cos\\theta - 432 \\sin\\theta \\). So that's correct.\n\nSo, the maximum is \\( \\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = 540 \\).\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 540.\n",

Let me compute it again.\n\n324 * 324: Let me compute 300 * 300 =90,000, 300*24=7,200, 24*300=7,200, 24*24=576.\n\nWait, but 324 *324 is (300 +24)(300 +24) = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 =90,000 +14,400 +576= 90,000+14,400=104,400 +576=104,976. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, 432^2: 432*432. Let me compute it as (400+32)^2=400^2 +2*400*32 +32^2=160,000 +25,600 +1,024=160,000+25,600=185,600 +1,024=186,624. So that's correct.\n\nSo sum is 104,976 +186,624=291,600. Square root is 540, yes.\n\nSo, the maximum value of the real part is 540.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I applied the correct formula. The expression is \\( a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta \\), whose maximum is \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\).\n\nIn this case, the expression is \\( 324 \\cos\\theta - 432 \\sin\\theta \\), which can be written as \\( 324 \\cos\\theta + (-432) \\sin\\theta \\). So yes, \\( a =324 \\), \\( b= -432 \\), so the maximum is \\( \\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = 540 \\).\n\nSo, I think that's the answer. The largest possible real part is 540.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial steps.\n\nWait, so the original expression is \\( (75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z} \\).\n\nI represented \\( z =4 e^{i\\theta} \\), so \\( 1/z = (1/4) e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n\\( (75 +117i)*4 e^{i\\theta} = (300 + 468i) e^{i\\theta} \\).\n\nAnd \\( (96 +144i)/(4) e^{-i\\theta} = (24 +36i) e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nThen, the real parts:\n\nFor \\( (300 + 468i) e^{i\\theta} \\), the real part is \\( 300 \\cos\\theta - 468 \\sin\\theta \\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\( (24 +36i) e^{-i\\theta} \\), the real part is \\( 24 \\cos\\theta +36 \\sin\\theta \\).\n\nAdding these gives \\( 324 \\cos\\theta - 432 \\sin\\theta \\). So that's correct.\n\nSo, the maximum is \\( \\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = 540 \\).\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 540.\n\n\nTo find the largest possible real part of the expression \\((75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\) where \\(z\\) is a complex number with \\(|z| = 4\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Express \\(z\\) in polar form**: Let \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is the argument of \\(z\\). Then, \\(1/z = \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta}\\).\n\n2. **Substitute \\(z\\) into the expression**:\n   \\[\n   (75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i) \\cdot 4e^{i\\theta} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (96 + 144i) \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compute the real parts**:\n   - The real part of \\((300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta}\\) is \\(300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta\\).\n   - The real part of \\((24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\\) is \\(24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta\\).\n\n4. **Sum the real parts**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Real Part} = (300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta) + (24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta) = 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find the maximum value**:\n   The expression \\(324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta\\) can be rewritten as \\(R\\cos(\\theta + \\phi)\\), where \\(R = \\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2}\\). Calculating \\(R\\):\n   \\[\n   R = \\sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \\sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \\sqrt{291600} = 540\n   \\]\n\nThus, the largest possible real part is \\(\\boxed{540}\\).",
