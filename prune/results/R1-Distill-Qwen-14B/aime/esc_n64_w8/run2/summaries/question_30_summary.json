      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the 13th roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^13 = 1. So \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9 \u2260 1. That means \u03c9^k for k from 0 to 12 will give me all the distinct roots. Also, I know that the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure yet how that comes into play here.\n\nThe expression I need to compute is the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me write that down:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\n\nHmm. Each term in the product is of the form (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Maybe I can factor or simplify this expression somehow.\n\nLet me try to factor each term. Let's denote z = \u03c9^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2z + z\u00b2. Let me write that as z\u00b2 - 2z + 2. So, each term is a quadratic in z.\n\nSo, the product becomes \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2) where z = \u03c9^k. But since \u03c9^k runs through all the 13th roots of unity as k goes from 0 to 12, including \u03c9^0 = 1.\n\nWait, but \u03c9 \u2260 1, so maybe I should consider the product over all \u03c9^k where \u03c9^k \u2260 1? No, wait, the product is from k=0 to 12, so it includes k=0, which gives \u03c9^0 = 1. So, I need to include that term as well.\n\nSo, maybe I can think of this as evaluating a polynomial at certain points. Let me consider the polynomial P(z) = z\u00b2 - 2z + 2. Then, the product we're looking at is P(1) * P(\u03c9) * P(\u03c9\u00b2) * ... * P(\u03c9^{12}).\n\nWait, no. Because each term is P(z) where z is \u03c9^k, but the product is over all z = \u03c9^k for k from 0 to 12. So, the product is the product of P(z) as z ranges over all 13th roots of unity.\n\nBut wait, P(z) is a quadratic polynomial, so the product over all roots of unity of P(z) would be related to some cyclotomic polynomial or something else? I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for a polynomial Q(z), the product over all roots of unity of Q(z) can sometimes be expressed using cyclotomic polynomials. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact approach here.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that the product over all nth roots of unity of (z - a) is z^n - 1. But in our case, each term is quadratic. Maybe I can find a generating function or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that the product we have is equal to the product over all k of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Let me write each term as (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me factor 2 out of the first two terms: 2(1 - \u03c9^k) + \u03c9^{2k}. Not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, another thought. Let's consider that each term is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Maybe we can factor this as (\u03c9^k - a)(\u03c9^k - b) for some a and b.\n\nLet me try to factor 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let's treat this as a quadratic in \u03c9^k.\n\nSo, \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2 = 0.\n\nLet me solve for \u03c9^k: Let x = \u03c9^k. Then x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula, x = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo, the roots are 1 + i and 1 - i. Therefore, the quadratic factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nTherefore, each term in the product is (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, the entire product becomes:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) * (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich can be written as [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nHmm, okay, so now I have two products, each over all 13th roots of unity. Let me denote these two products as A and B, where A = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) and B = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, Product = A * B.\n\nNow, how do I compute A and B? I remember that the product over all nth roots of unity of (z - a) is equal to z^{\u03c6(n)} - 1, but wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Wait, more accurately, the product over all nth roots of unity of (z - \u03c9^k) is equal to z^n - 1. Because each \u03c9^k is a root of z^n - 1 = 0.\n\nSo, in our case, for a constant a, the product over all \u03c9^k (which are the roots of z^13 - 1 = 0) of (a - \u03c9^k) is equal to (a^13 - 1). Wait, no, actually, the product would be (a^13 - 1) if we have the product over (z - \u03c9^k), but in our case, it's (a - \u03c9^k) which is the same as (-1)(\u03c9^k - a). So, the product becomes (-1)^{13} times the product of (\u03c9^k - a), which is (-1)^{13} * (a^13 - 1).\n\nWait, let me think carefully. The product over k=0 to 12 of (z - \u03c9^k) is equal to z^13 - 1. So, if I set z = a, then the product over k=0 to 12 of (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because z^13 - 1 factors as \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z - \u03c9^k). So yes, if I set z = a, then the product is a^13 - 1.\n\nWait, so in our case, A is the product over (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) which is the same as (-1)^{13} times the product over ((1 + i) - \u03c9^k). So, A = (-1)^{13} * [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nSimilarly, B = (-1)^{13} * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nSince (-1)^{13} is -1, so A = - [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] and B = - [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nTherefore, Product = A * B = [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nSimplify that: (-1)^2 * [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nWhich is 1 * [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nSo, Product = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nHmm, okay, so now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI remember that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. Let me recall that 1 + i has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of \u03c0/4 radians. Similarly, 1 - i has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of -\u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}, and (1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^{13} * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^{13} * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute [sqrt(2)]^{13}: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} and e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nNote that 13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13/4 = 3 + 1/4. So, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is the same as \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Wait, no, because 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0. Let me compute 13\u03c0/4:\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3.25, so 3 full circles (which is 6\u03c0) and 0.25*2\u03c0 = \u03c0/2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 13\u03c0/4 is the same as 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so subtracting 2\u03c0 gives 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, sqrt(2) multiplied by (-sqrt(2)/2) is (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 * (-1) = 2/2 * (-1) = -1.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2) multiplied by (-i sqrt(2)/2) is (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 * (-i) = 2/2 * (-i) = -i.\n\nSo, 64 * [ (-1) + (-i) ] = 64*(-1 - i) = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nAgain, sqrt(2) multiplied by (-sqrt(2)/2) is -1, and sqrt(2) multiplied by i sqrt(2)/2 is i.\n\nSo, 64 * [ (-1) + i ] = 64*(-1 + i) = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i,\n\n(1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nTherefore, let's compute (1 + i)^13 - 1:\n\n-64 -64i - 1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 - 1:\n\n-64 + 64i - 1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, Product = (-65 -64i) * (-65 +64i).\n\nThis is of the form (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, where a = -65 and b =64i.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, it's (a + b)(a - b) where a = -65 and b =64i. So, the product is (-65)^2 - (64i)^2.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n(-65)^2 = 4225,\n\n(64i)^2 = (64)^2 * i^2 = 4096 * (-1) = -4096.\n\nSo, the product is 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, that seems manageable. So, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again:\n\n(-65 -64i) * (-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096*(-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire product is 8321. Now, the question is to find the remainder when this number is divided by 1000.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. Because 8*1000=8000, and 8321 -8000=321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents or the multiplication.\n\nWait, let me go through the steps again.\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13: 1 + i is sqrt(2) at 45 degrees. Raising to the 13th power: magnitude is (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). Angle is 13 * 45 degrees = 585 degrees. 585 - 360 = 225 degrees, which is 5\u03c0/4 radians. So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (cos 225 + i sin 225) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1 -i). So, that part is correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13: 1 - i is sqrt(2) at -45 degrees. 13 * (-45) = -585 degrees. Adding 720 degrees (two full circles) to get it in positive terms: -585 + 720 = 135 degrees, which is 3\u03c0/4 radians. So, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (cos 135 + i sin 135) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1 + i). So that's correct.\n\nThen, (1 + i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i. Similarly, (1 -i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i. Correct.\n\nMultiplying (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 +4096=8321. Correct.\n\n8321 mod 1000 is 321. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought, what about k=0? When k=0, \u03c9^0=1. So, the term is 2 - 2*1 +1^2 = 2 -2 +1=1. So, that term is 1. So, when I took the product from k=0 to 12, that included k=0, which gave 1. But in my earlier approach, when I expressed the product as A * B, which were the products over all \u03c9^k, including 1, I think that was correctly handled.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't miss anything. So, when I considered the product over all \u03c9^k, including 1, I correctly accounted for the k=0 term in the product.\n\nSo, in the end, the product is 8321, and mod 1000 is 321. So, the answer is 321.\n\nWait, but I just thought, is 8321 correct? Let me compute 64*sqrt(2)*e^{i*5\u03c0/4}.\n\nWait, but 64*sqrt(2) is 64*1.4142\u224890.5097. But when I compute (1 + i)^13, I got -64 -64i, which is a complex number with magnitude sqrt( (-64)^2 + (-64)^2 )=sqrt(4096 +4096)=sqrt(8192)=~90.5097. So, that matches. So, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the magnitude is correct, and the angle is 5\u03c0/4, so the real and imaginary parts are both negative, which is what I got.\n\nSimilarly for (1 - i)^13, the angle is 3\u03c0/4, so the real part is negative and the imaginary part is positive. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the rest of the steps seem correct. So, I think 8321 is the right product, and 321 is the remainder when divided by 1000.\n\nSo, the answer is 321.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that the product we need to compute is over all 13th roots of unity, including \\( \\omega^0 = 1 \\).

Then x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula, x = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo, the roots are 1 + i and 1 - i. Therefore, the quadratic factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nTherefore, each term in the product is (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, the entire product becomes:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) * (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich can be written as [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nHmm, okay, so now I have two products, each over all 13th roots of unity. Let me denote these two products as A and B, where A = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) and B = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, Product = A * B.\n\nNow, how do I compute A and B? I remember that the product over all nth roots of unity of (z - a) is equal to z^{\u03c6(n)} - 1, but wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Wait, more accurately, the product over all nth roots of unity of (z - \u03c9^k) is equal to z^n - 1. Because each \u03c9^k is a root of z^n - 1 = 0.\n\nSo, in our case, for a constant a, the product over all \u03c9^k (which are the roots of z^13 - 1 = 0) of (a - \u03c9^k) is equal to (a^13 - 1). Wait, no, actually, the product would be (a^13 - 1) if we have the product over (z - \u03c9^k), but in our case, it's (a - \u03c9^k) which is the same as (-1)(\u03c9^k - a). So, the product becomes (-1)^{13} times the product of (\u03c9^k - a), which is (-1)^{13} * (a^13 - 1).\n\nWait, let me think carefully. The product over k=0 to 12 of (z - \u03c9^k) is equal to z^13 - 1. So, if I set z = a, then the product over k=0 to 12 of (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because z^13 - 1 factors as \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z - \u03c9^k). So yes, if I set z = a, then the product is a^13 - 1.\n\nWait, so in our case, A is the product over (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) which is the same as (-1)^{13} times the product over ((1 + i) - \u03c9^k). So, A = (-1)^{13} * [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nSimilarly, B = (-1)^{13} * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nSince (-1)^{13} is -1, so A = - [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] and B = - [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nTherefore, Product = A * B = [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nSimplify that: (-1)^2 * [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nWhich is 1 * [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nSo, Product = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nHmm, okay, so now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI remember that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. Let me recall that 1 + i has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of \u03c0/4 radians. Similarly, 1 - i has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of -\u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}, and (1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^{13} * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^{13} * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute [sqrt(2)]^{13}: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} and e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nNote that 13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13/4 = 3 + 1/4. So, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is the same as \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Wait, no, because 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0. Let me compute 13\u03c0/4:\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3.25, so 3 full circles (which is 6\u03c0) and 0.25*2\u03c0 = \u03c0/2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 13\u03c0/4 is the same as 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so subtracting 2\u03c0 gives 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, sqrt(2) multiplied by (-sqrt(2)/2) is (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 * (-1) = 2/2 * (-1) = -1.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2) multiplied by (-i sqrt(2)/2) is (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 * (-i) = 2/2 * (-i) = -i.\n\nSo, 64 * [ (-1) + (-i) ] = 64*(-1 - i) = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nAgain, sqrt(2) multiplied by (-sqrt(2)/2) is -1, and sqrt(2) multiplied by i sqrt(2)/2 is i.\n\nSo, 64 * [ (-1) + i ] = 64*(-1 + i) = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i,\n\n(1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nTherefore, let's compute (1 + i)^13 - 1:\n\n-64 -64i - 1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 - 1:\n\n-64 + 64i - 1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, Product = (-65 -64i) * (-65 +64i).\n\nThis is of the form (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, where a = -65 and b =64i.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, it's (a + b)(a - b) where a = -65 and b =64i. So, the product is (-65)^2 - (64i)^2.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n(-65)^2 = 4225,\n\n(64i)^2 = (64)^2 * i^2 = 4096 * (-1) = -4096.\n\nSo, the product is 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, that seems manageable. So, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again:\n\n(-65 -64i) * (-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096*(-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire product is 8321. Now, the question is to find the remainder when this number is divided by 1000.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. Because 8*1000=8000, and 8321 -8000=321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents or the multiplication.\n\nWait, let me go through the steps again.\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13: 1 + i is sqrt(2) at 45 degrees. Raising to the 13th power: magnitude is (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). Angle is 13 * 45 degrees = 585 degrees. 585 - 360 = 225 degrees, which is 5\u03c0/4 radians. So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (cos 225 + i sin 225) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1 -i). So, that part is correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13: 1 - i is sqrt(2) at -45 degrees. 13 * (-45) = -585 degrees. Adding 720 degrees (two full circles) to get it in positive terms: -585 + 720 = 135 degrees, which is 3\u03c0/4 radians. So, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (cos 135 + i sin 135) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1 + i). So that's correct.\n\nThen, (1 + i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i. Similarly, (1 -i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i. Correct.\n\nMultiplying (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 +4096=8321. Correct.\n\n8321 mod 1000 is 321. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought, what about k=0? When k=0, \u03c9^0=1. So, the term is 2 - 2*1 +1^2 = 2 -2 +1=1. So, that term is 1. So, when I took the product from k=0 to 12, that included k=0, which gave 1. But in my earlier approach, when I expressed the product as A * B, which were the products over all \u03c9^k, including 1, I think that was correctly handled.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't miss anything. So, when I considered the product over all \u03c9^k, including 1, I correctly accounted for the k=0 term in the product.\n\nSo, in the end, the product is 8321, and mod 1000 is 321. So, the answer is 321.\n\nWait, but I just thought, is 8321 correct? Let me compute 64*sqrt(2)*e^{i*5\u03c0/4}.\n\nWait, but 64*sqrt(2) is 64*1.4142\u224890.5097. But when I compute (1 + i)^13, I got -64 -64i, which is a complex number with magnitude sqrt( (-64)^2 + (-64)^2 )=sqrt(4096 +4096)=sqrt(8192)=~90.5097. So, that matches. So, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the magnitude is correct, and the angle is 5\u03c0/4, so the real and imaginary parts are both negative, which is what I got.\n\nSimilarly for (1 - i)^13, the angle is 3\u03c0/4, so the real part is negative and the imaginary part is positive. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the rest of the steps seem correct. So, I think 8321 is the right product, and 321 is the remainder when divided by 1000.\n\nSo, the answer is 321.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that the product we need to compute is over all 13th roots of unity, including \\( \\omega^0 = 1 \\). Each term in the product is of the form \\( 2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k} \\), which can be rewritten as \\( \\omega^{2k} - 2\\omega^k + 2 \\). Factoring this quadratic expression in \\( \\omega^k \\), we find that it factors as \\( ( \\omega^k - (1 + i) )( \\omega^k - (1 - i) ) \\).\n\nThus, the entire product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} ( \\omega^k - (1 + i) ) \\cdot \\prod_{k=0}^{12} ( \\omega^k - (1 - i) )\n\\]\n\nEach of these products can be evaluated using the fact that the product of \\( (z - \\omega^k) \\) over all 13th roots of unity \\( \\omega^k \\) is \\( z^{13} - 1 \\). Substituting \\( z = 1 + i \\) and \\( z = 1 - i \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} ( \\omega^k - (1 + i) ) = - ( (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ), \\quad \\prod_{k=0}^{12} ( \\omega^k - (1 - i) ) = - ( (1 - i)^{13} - 1 )\n\\]\n\nNext, we compute \\( (1 + i)^{13} \\) and \\( (1 - i)^{13} \\). Expressing \\( 1 + i \\) and \\( 1 - i \\) in polar form, we find:\n\n\\[\n(1 + i)^{13} = 64\\sqrt{2} \\cdot e^{i \\cdot 5\\pi/4} = -64 - 64i, \\quad (1 - i)^{13} = 64\\sqrt{2} \\cdot e^{-i \\cdot 5\\pi/4} = -64 + 64i\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 1 from each, we get:\n\n\\[\n(1 + i)^{13} - 1 = -65 - 64i, \\quad (1 - i)^{13} - 1 = -65 + 64i\n\\]\n\nMultiplying these results:\n\n\\[\n(-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000:\n\n\\[\n8321 \\mod 1000 = 321\n\\]\n\nThus, the remainder is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{321}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, and \u03c9 \u2260 1. Hmm, okay, so \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, right?\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to cyclotomic polynomials. But I'm not exactly sure how that applies here. Let me think.\n\nThe product is over k from 0 to 12, which includes all the 13th roots of unity, since \u03c9^k for k=0 to 12 cycles through all the roots. So each term in the product is of the form (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nWait, maybe I can factor or simplify each term. Let's see:\n\nLet me take a single term: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}.\n\nHmm, can I write this as something squared or maybe a quadratic in \u03c9^k? Let's see:\n\nSuppose I let x = \u03c9^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2x + x\u00b2. Let me rearrange that: x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Hmm, that's a quadratic in x. Can I factor this quadratic?\n\nLooking at x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, the discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so it doesn't factor over the reals. Maybe it's related to complex roots, but I don't see an immediate factorization. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of another quadratic.\n\nWait, I remember that x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = (x - 1)^2 + 1. So, that's (x - 1)^2 + 1. Hmm, interesting. So, for each k, the term is (\u03c9^k - 1)^2 + 1.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps me yet. Let me think about the product over all k.\n\nSo, the entire product is the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write each term as 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = 2 + \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k. Let me see if that's a familiar form.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps each term can be expressed as (\u03c9^k - a)(\u03c9^k - b) for some a and b. But earlier, the quadratic didn't factor over real numbers, so maybe over complex numbers? Let me see:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2x + 2 can be factored as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Because (1 + i) and (1 - i) are roots of the quadratic equation x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0. Let me check:\n\n(1 + i)\u00b2 - 2(1 + i) + 2 = (1 + 2i -1) - 2 - 2i + 2 = (2i) - 2 - 2i + 2 = 0. Yeah, that works. So, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 factors into (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, each term in the product is (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nHmm, so that product is equal to [product from k=0 to 12 (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] multiplied by [product from k=0 to 12 (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nI know that the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is the cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6_13(x), which is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. Wait, no, actually, \u03a6_n(x) is the minimal polynomial for primitive nth roots of unity. But since 13 is prime, \u03a6_13(x) is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. So, the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is \u03a6_13(x) evaluated at x, but wait, actually, the product is \u03a6_13(x) when x is not 1, but when x is 1, it's different.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. The cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6_n(x) is the product of (x - \u03c9^k) where \u03c9^k runs over the primitive nth roots of unity. But since 13 is prime, all roots except 1 are primitive. So, \u03a6_13(x) is the product from k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k). So, the product from k=0 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) would be (x - 1)\u03a6_13(x).\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = (x - 1)(x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1).\n\nBut in our case, we have product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) for a = 1 + i and a = 1 - i. So, let's compute this.\n\nLet me set x = a, so product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) multiplied by (-1)^13, since each term is (a - \u03c9^k) = (-1)(\u03c9^k - a). So, the product becomes (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 times our desired product.\n\nBut product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) is equal to a^13 - 1, because the product of (a - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is a^13 - 1. Because each \u03c9^k is a 13th root of unity, so the product is the value of the polynomial x^13 - 1 evaluated at x = a.\n\nWait, yes, because x^13 - 1 = product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k). So, if x = a, then product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1.\n\nBut we have product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = (-1)^13 (a^13 - 1) = - (a^13 - 1).\n\nTherefore, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a^13 - 1).\n\nSo, applying this to our problem, for a = 1 + i and a = 1 - i.\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ]\n\nSimilarly, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = - [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ]\n\nTherefore, the entire product we're looking for is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] multiplied by [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nSimplify that:\n\n= (-1) * ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * (-1) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 )\n\nThe two (-1)s multiply to 1, so it becomes:\n\n= [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ]\n\nSo, now, we need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. Let me recall that 1 + i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4 radians (45 degrees). Similarly, 1 - i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4 }\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * (-\u03c0/4) }\n\nLet me compute [sqrt(2)]^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the angles: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let's compute 13 * \u03c0/4.\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, let me subtract multiples of 2\u03c0.\n\n13\u03c0/4 = (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4.\n\nBut 3\u03c0 is 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, 13*(-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4 = -(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = -\u03c0 - \u03c0/4 = -5\u03c0/4. But since angles are periodic with 2\u03c0, -5\u03c0/4 is the same as 3\u03c0/4 (because adding 2\u03c0: -5\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = 3\u03c0/4).\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n-5\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = (-5\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0/4. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * e^{i 5\u03c0/4} = 64 sqrt(2) [ cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) ]\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * e^{i 3\u03c0/4} = 64 sqrt(2) [ cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) ]\n\nLet me compute these:\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\ncos(3\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) ]\n\nSimplify that:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) (1 + i) = 64 * (- (2)/2) (1 + i) = 64 * (-1) (1 + i) = -64(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) ]\n\nWait, let me compute it step by step:\n\n(1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) ] = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ]\n\n= 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) (1 - i) because factoring sqrt(2)/2:\n\nWait, actually, the terms are (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) = sqrt(2)/2 (-1 + i) = sqrt(2)/2 (i - 1). Hmm, but perhaps I can factor it as:\n\nsqrt(2)/2 ( -1 + i ) = sqrt(2)/2 * (i - 1) = sqrt(2)/2 * i (1 + i). Wait, maybe that's complicating.\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1) + i (sqrt(2)/2)(1) ]\n\nFactor out sqrt(2)/2:\n\n= 64 sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 [ (-1) + i (1) ]\n\n= 64 * (2)/2 [ (-1 + i) ]\n\n= 64 * 1 [ (-1 + i) ] = 64 (-1 + i) = -64(1 - i).\n\nWait, but wait, let me check:\n\nsqrt(2) * sqrt(2) is 2, right? So, 64 sqrt(2) multiplied by sqrt(2)/2 is 64*(2)/2=64.\n\nSo, yes, that works. So, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), and (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\nSo, now, going back to the product:\n\n[ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] = [ -64(1 + i) - 1 ] * [ -64(1 - i) - 1 ]\n\nLet me compute each term inside the brackets:\n\nFirst term: -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 - 64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSecond term: -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 + 64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, now the product is (-65 -64i) * (-65 +64i).\n\nThis is a product of complex conjugates, so it equals (-65)^2 - (64i)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(-65)^2 = 4225.\n\n(64i)^2 = (64)^2 (i)^2 = 4096 * (-1) = -4096.\n\nSo, 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the entire product is 8321.\n\nWait, so the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) equals 8321.\n\nBut the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000.\n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13:\n\nWe said (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i). Let me verify:\n\n(1 + i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i\u00b2 = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i.\n\n(1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4.\n\n(1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.\n\n(1 + i)^12 = (16)*( (1 + i)^4 )^3 = 16 * (-4)^3 = 16*(-64) = -1024.\n\nWait, wait, that's different from what I had earlier. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier calculation.\n\nWait, wait, let's compute (1 + i)^13 step by step.\n\n(1 + i)^1 = 1 + i.\n\n(1 + i)^2 = 2i.\n\n(1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4.\n\n(1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.\n\n(1 + i)^12 = (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i)^4 = 16 * (-4) = -64.\n\nThen, (1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^12 * (1 + i) = (-64)(1 + i) = -64 -64i.\n\nWait, so that's correct. So, (1 + i)^13 is indeed -64(1 + i). So, then:\n\n(1 + i)^13 -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i). Let me verify:\n\n(1 - i)^1 = 1 - i.\n\n(1 - i)^2 = 1 - 2i + i\u00b2 = 1 - 2i -1 = -2i.\n\n(1 - i)^4 = (-2i)^2 = -4.\n\n(1 - i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.\n\n(1 - i)^12 = 16*(-4) = -64.\n\n(1 - i)^13 = (1 - i)^12*(1 - i) = (-64)(1 - i) = -64 +64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2.\n\nWhich is 4225 - (4096)(i\u00b2) = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, 8321 mod 1000 is 321, since 8*1000 =8000, 8321-8000=321.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is the product equal to 8321? Because in the initial step, when I expressed each term as (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)), and then took the product over k=0 to 12, which gave me product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) times product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich, as I computed, each product is -[(1 + i)^13 -1] and -[(1 - i)^13 -1]. Wait, wait, no, each product was - (a^13 -1), where a is 1 + i and 1 - i respectively.\n\nSo, the product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ] = ( - ( -64(1 + i) -1 )) * ( - ( -64(1 - i) -1 )).\n\nWait, hold on. Let me re-examine:\n\nproduct_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a^13 -1). So, for a = 1 + i:\n\nproduct_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ]\n\nSimilarly, for a = 1 - i:\n\nproduct_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = - [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ]\n\nSo, the entire product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ].\n\nWhich is [ - ( -64(1 + i) -1 ) ] * [ - ( -64(1 - i) -1 ) ]\n\nWait, no, wait: (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i). So, (1 + i)^13 -1 = -64(1 + i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSo, - [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] = - [ -65 -64i ] = 65 +64i.\n\nSimilarly, - [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ] = - [ -65 +64i ] = 65 -64i.\n\nSo, the product is (65 +64i)(65 -64i) = 65^2 - (64i)^2.\n\nCompute 65^2 = 4225.\n\n(64i)^2 = 4096 * (-1) = -4096.\n\nSo, 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Yes, same result.\n\nSo, the product is indeed 8321. So, mod 1000, that's 8321 - 8*1000 = 321.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me check: 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with remainder 321, yes.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves finding the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive 13th root of unity.\n\nFirst, each term in the product is rewritten as \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k} = \\omega^{2k} - 2\\omega^k + 2\\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, and \u03c9 \u2260 1. Hmm, okay, so \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, right?\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to cyclotomic polynomials. But I'm not exactly sure how that applies here. Let me think.\n\nThe product is over k from 0 to 12, which includes all the 13th roots of unity, since \u03c9^k for k=0 to 12 cycles through all the roots. So each term in the product is of the form (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nWait, maybe I can factor or simplify each term. Let's see:\n\nLet me take a single term: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}.\n\nHmm, can I write this as something squared or maybe a quadratic in \u03c9^k? Let's see:\n\nSuppose I let x = \u03c9^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2x + x\u00b2. Let me rearrange that: x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Hmm, that's a quadratic in x. Can I factor this quadratic?\n\nLooking at x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, the discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so it doesn't factor over the reals. Maybe it's related to complex roots, but I don't see an immediate factorization. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of another quadratic.\n\nWait, I remember that x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = (x - 1)^2 + 1. So, that's (x - 1)^2 + 1. Hmm, interesting. So, for each k, the term is (\u03c9^k - 1)^2 + 1.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps me yet. Let me think about the product over all k.\n\nSo, the entire product is the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write each term as 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = 2 + \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k. Let me see if that's a familiar form.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps each term can be expressed as (\u03c9^k - a)(\u03c9^k - b) for some a and b. But earlier, the quadratic didn't factor over real numbers, so maybe over complex numbers? Let me see:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2x + 2 can be factored as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Because (1 + i) and (1 - i) are roots of the quadratic equation x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0. Let me check:\n\n(1 + i)\u00b2 - 2(1 + i) + 2 = (1 + 2i -1) - 2 - 2i + 2 = (2i) - 2 - 2i + 2 = 0. Yeah, that works. So, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 factors into (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, each term in the product is (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nHmm, so that product is equal to [product from k=0 to 12 (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] multiplied by [product from k=0 to 12 (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nI know that the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is the cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6_13(x), which is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. Wait, no, actually, \u03a6_n(x) is the minimal polynomial for primitive nth roots of unity. But since 13 is prime, \u03a6_13(x) is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. So, the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is \u03a6_13(x) evaluated at x, but wait, actually, the product is \u03a6_13(x) when x is not 1, but when x is 1, it's different.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. The cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6_n(x) is the product of (x - \u03c9^k) where \u03c9^k runs over the primitive nth roots of unity. But since 13 is prime, all roots except 1 are primitive. So, \u03a6_13(x) is the product from k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k). So, the product from k=0 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) would be (x - 1)\u03a6_13(x).\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = (x - 1)(x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1).\n\nBut in our case, we have product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) for a = 1 + i and a = 1 - i. So, let's compute this.\n\nLet me set x = a, so product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) multiplied by (-1)^13, since each term is (a - \u03c9^k) = (-1)(\u03c9^k - a). So, the product becomes (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 times our desired product.\n\nBut product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) is equal to a^13 - 1, because the product of (a - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is a^13 - 1. Because each \u03c9^k is a 13th root of unity, so the product is the value of the polynomial x^13 - 1 evaluated at x = a.\n\nWait, yes, because x^13 - 1 = product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k). So, if x = a, then product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1.\n\nBut we have product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = (-1)^13 (a^13 - 1) = - (a^13 - 1).\n\nTherefore, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a^13 - 1).\n\nSo, applying this to our problem, for a = 1 + i and a = 1 - i.\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ]\n\nSimilarly, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = - [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ]\n\nTherefore, the entire product we're looking for is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] multiplied by [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nSimplify that:\n\n= (-1) * ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * (-1) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 )\n\nThe two (-1)s multiply to 1, so it becomes:\n\n= [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ]\n\nSo, now, we need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. Let me recall that 1 + i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4 radians (45 degrees). Similarly, 1 - i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4 }\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * (-\u03c0/4) }\n\nLet me compute [sqrt(2)]^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the angles: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let's compute 13 * \u03c0/4.\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, let me subtract multiples of 2\u03c0.\n\n13\u03c0/4 = (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4.\n\nBut 3\u03c0 is 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, 13*(-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4 = -(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = -\u03c0 - \u03c0/4 = -5\u03c0/4. But since angles are periodic with 2\u03c0, -5\u03c0/4 is the same as 3\u03c0/4 (because adding 2\u03c0: -5\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = 3\u03c0/4).\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n-5\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = (-5\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0/4. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * e^{i 5\u03c0/4} = 64 sqrt(2) [ cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) ]\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * e^{i 3\u03c0/4} = 64 sqrt(2) [ cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) ]\n\nLet me compute these:\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\ncos(3\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) ]\n\nSimplify that:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) (1 + i) = 64 * (- (2)/2) (1 + i) = 64 * (-1) (1 + i) = -64(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) ]\n\nWait, let me compute it step by step:\n\n(1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) ] = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ]\n\n= 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) (1 - i) because factoring sqrt(2)/2:\n\nWait, actually, the terms are (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) = sqrt(2)/2 (-1 + i) = sqrt(2)/2 (i - 1). Hmm, but perhaps I can factor it as:\n\nsqrt(2)/2 ( -1 + i ) = sqrt(2)/2 * (i - 1) = sqrt(2)/2 * i (1 + i). Wait, maybe that's complicating.\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1) + i (sqrt(2)/2)(1) ]\n\nFactor out sqrt(2)/2:\n\n= 64 sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 [ (-1) + i (1) ]\n\n= 64 * (2)/2 [ (-1 + i) ]\n\n= 64 * 1 [ (-1 + i) ] = 64 (-1 + i) = -64(1 - i).\n\nWait, but wait, let me check:\n\nsqrt(2) * sqrt(2) is 2, right? So, 64 sqrt(2) multiplied by sqrt(2)/2 is 64*(2)/2=64.\n\nSo, yes, that works. So, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), and (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\nSo, now, going back to the product:\n\n[ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] = [ -64(1 + i) - 1 ] * [ -64(1 - i) - 1 ]\n\nLet me compute each term inside the brackets:\n\nFirst term: -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 - 64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSecond term: -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 + 64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, now the product is (-65 -64i) * (-65 +64i).\n\nThis is a product of complex conjugates, so it equals (-65)^2 - (64i)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(-65)^2 = 4225.\n\n(64i)^2 = (64)^2 (i)^2 = 4096 * (-1) = -4096.\n\nSo, 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the entire product is 8321.\n\nWait, so the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) equals 8321.\n\nBut the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000.\n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13:\n\nWe said (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i). Let me verify:\n\n(1 + i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i\u00b2 = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i.\n\n(1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4.\n\n(1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.\n\n(1 + i)^12 = (16)*( (1 + i)^4 )^3 = 16 * (-4)^3 = 16*(-64) = -1024.\n\nWait, wait, that's different from what I had earlier. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier calculation.\n\nWait, wait, let's compute (1 + i)^13 step by step.\n\n(1 + i)^1 = 1 + i.\n\n(1 + i)^2 = 2i.\n\n(1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4.\n\n(1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.\n\n(1 + i)^12 = (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i)^4 = 16 * (-4) = -64.\n\nThen, (1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^12 * (1 + i) = (-64)(1 + i) = -64 -64i.\n\nWait, so that's correct. So, (1 + i)^13 is indeed -64(1 + i). So, then:\n\n(1 + i)^13 -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i). Let me verify:\n\n(1 - i)^1 = 1 - i.\n\n(1 - i)^2 = 1 - 2i + i\u00b2 = 1 - 2i -1 = -2i.\n\n(1 - i)^4 = (-2i)^2 = -4.\n\n(1 - i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.\n\n(1 - i)^12 = 16*(-4) = -64.\n\n(1 - i)^13 = (1 - i)^12*(1 - i) = (-64)(1 - i) = -64 +64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2.\n\nWhich is 4225 - (4096)(i\u00b2) = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, 8321 mod 1000 is 321, since 8*1000 =8000, 8321-8000=321.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is the product equal to 8321? Because in the initial step, when I expressed each term as (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)), and then took the product over k=0 to 12, which gave me product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) times product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich, as I computed, each product is -[(1 + i)^13 -1] and -[(1 - i)^13 -1]. Wait, wait, no, each product was - (a^13 -1), where a is 1 + i and 1 - i respectively.\n\nSo, the product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ] = ( - ( -64(1 + i) -1 )) * ( - ( -64(1 - i) -1 )).\n\nWait, hold on. Let me re-examine:\n\nproduct_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a^13 -1). So, for a = 1 + i:\n\nproduct_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ]\n\nSimilarly, for a = 1 - i:\n\nproduct_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = - [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ]\n\nSo, the entire product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ].\n\nWhich is [ - ( -64(1 + i) -1 ) ] * [ - ( -64(1 - i) -1 ) ]\n\nWait, no, wait: (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i). So, (1 + i)^13 -1 = -64(1 + i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSo, - [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] = - [ -65 -64i ] = 65 +64i.\n\nSimilarly, - [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ] = - [ -65 +64i ] = 65 -64i.\n\nSo, the product is (65 +64i)(65 -64i) = 65^2 - (64i)^2.\n\nCompute 65^2 = 4225.\n\n(64i)^2 = 4096 * (-1) = -4096.\n\nSo, 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Yes, same result.\n\nSo, the product is indeed 8321. So, mod 1000, that's 8321 - 8*1000 = 321.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me check: 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with remainder 321, yes.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive 13th root of unity.\n\nFirst, each term in the product is rewritten as \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k} = \\omega^{2k} - 2\\omega^k + 2\\). Factoring this quadratic expression in terms of \\(x = \\omega^k\\), we find it factors as \\((x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i))\\), where \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit. Thus, each term becomes \\((\\omega^k - (1 + i))(\\omega^k - (1 - i))\\).\n\nThe entire product then becomes:\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 + i)) \\times \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 - i))\n\\]\n\nUsing the property of cyclotomic polynomials, the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - a)\\) is equivalent to \\(- (a^{13} - 1)\\) for \\(a = 1 + i\\) and \\(a = 1 - i\\). Therefore, we compute:\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 + i)) = -[(1 + i)^{13} - 1]\n\\]\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 - i)) = -[(1 - i)^{13} - 1]\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\((1 + i)^{13}\\) and \\((1 - i)^{13}\\). Expressing \\(1 + i\\) and \\(1 - i\\) in polar form, we find:\n\\[\n(1 + i)^{13} = 64\\sqrt{2} \\cdot e^{i \\cdot 13\\pi/4} = -64(1 + i)\n\\]\n\\[\n(1 - i)^{13} = 64\\sqrt{2} \\cdot e^{i \\cdot (-13\\pi/4)} = -64(1 - i)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these into the products:\n\\[\n-[(1 + i)^{13} - 1] = -[-64(1 + i) - 1] = 65 + 64i\n\\]\n\\[\n-[(1 - i)^{13} - 1] = -[-64(1 - i) - 1] = 65 - 64i\n\\]\n\nThe product of these terms is:\n\\[\n(65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321\n\\]\n\nFinally, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is:\n\\[\n8321 \\mod 1000 = 321\n\\]\n\nThus, the remainder is \\(\\boxed{321}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies \u03c9^13 = 1. Also, all the roots are the solutions to the equation x^13 - 1 = 0. So, the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x), which is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. Maybe that will come in handy later.\n\nNow, the product I'm looking at is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me denote each term in the product as P_k = 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. I need to compute the product of all P_k for k=0 to 12.\n\nWait a second, when k=0, \u03c9^0 is 1, so P_0 would be 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So I can ignore k=0 because multiplying by 1 doesn't change the product. That simplifies things a bit.\n\nSo now, the product reduces to the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Hmm, that's 12 terms. Maybe I can find a pattern or a way to express this product in terms of polynomials.\n\nLet me see if I can rewrite P_k = 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} in a different way. Let me factor out a 2: P_k = 2(1 - \u03c9^k) + \u03c9^{2k}. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, I can write it as P_k = 2(1 - \u03c9^k) + (\u03c9^k)^2.\n\nWait, perhaps if I let x = \u03c9^k, then P_k becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. So, P_k = x^2 - 2x + 2. That's a quadratic in x. So, for each k, P_k is a quadratic in x = \u03c9^k.\n\nSo, the product becomes the product from x=\u03c9 to x=\u03c9^{12} of (x^2 - 2x + 2). But wait, x takes on all the 13th roots of unity except 1, since k goes from 1 to 12. So, the product is the product over all x \u2260 1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2).\n\nHmm, this seems like evaluating a polynomial at certain roots. Let me think about this. If I have a polynomial f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2, and I want to compute the product of f(x) as x ranges over all the 13th roots of unity except 1. But wait, actually, x is \u03c9^k for k=1 to 12, so they are all the 13th roots except 1.\n\nBut wait, the product over all roots x of f(x) would relate to the value of the polynomial whose roots are x=\u03c9^k, evaluated at something. Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the product over x^13 - 1 = 0 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) can be expressed as a resultant or something.\n\nWait, another approach: The product over all roots x of (x^2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over all x of f(x), where f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2, and x runs through the 13th roots of unity except 1. But since x^13 = 1, perhaps I can relate this to f(x) evaluated at x being a root of x^13 - 1.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as evaluating f(x) at each x = \u03c9^k, and then multiplying them all together. So, the product is the product from k=1 to 12 of f(\u03c9^k).\n\nBut wait, the product over all x of f(x), where x are the roots of x^13 - 1, is equal to the resultant of x^13 -1 and f(x), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the product over all x \u2260 1 of (x - a) is equal to (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) evaluated at x=a, but that's for linear factors.\n\nWait, but in this case, the factors are quadratic. So, perhaps I need a different approach. Let me think about the product over all x \u2260 1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2). That is, the product over all x where x^13 =1 and x \u22601 of (x^2 - 2x + 2).\n\nHmm, so perhaps I can write this as the product over x of (x^2 - 2x + 2), divided by the term at x=1. But the term at x=1 is (1 - 2 + 2) = 1, so that doesn't change anything. So the product is the product over all x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2).\n\nWait, but then x^13 =1, so maybe I can relate this to f(x) = x^2 -2x +2, and the product over all x^13=1 of f(x) is equal to the product of f(\u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12, which is the same as the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nWait, but that's the same as the product we have except we included k=0, which gives 1. So, the product from k=0 to 12 is equal to the product from k=1 to 12 multiplied by 1, so they are equal. Hmm, perhaps I can compute the product over all k=0 to 12, which is the same as the product over all x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x +2).\n\nBut how do I compute that product? I remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product over all roots x of (x - a) is f(a). But here, it's the product over all x^13=1 of f(x), where f(x) is another polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps using complex analysis or generating functions. Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the resultant or something else. Let me think.\n\nWait, another idea: The product over x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x +2) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^13 -1. But I'm not sure how to compute that. Alternatively, maybe using logarithms to turn the product into a sum, but that seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that for any polynomial g(x), the product of g(\u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is equal to the product of g(x) evaluated at each root of x^13 -1. There's a formula for such products in terms of the greatest common divisor or something else.\n\nWait, I think the product over all x^13=1 of (x - a) is equal to (a^13 -1)/(a -1) when a \u22601, but that's for linear factors. But in our case, the factors are quadratic. So, perhaps I can think of it as evaluating f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 at each 13th root of unity and then taking the product.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the fact that the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 -1. So, if I have a polynomial f(x), then the product over k=0 to 12 of f(\u03c9^k) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^13 -1. But I'm not sure how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the product over roots of unity of a quadratic. Let me see. Suppose I have a quadratic polynomial Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Then, for each root \u03c9^k of x^13 -1, we have Q(\u03c9^k) = (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k +2). So, the product over k=0 to 12 is the product of Q(\u03c9^k) for each k.\n\nBut how do I compute this product? Maybe using properties of polynomials.\n\nWait, another approach: For a polynomial P(x), the product of P(\u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is equal to the product over all roots of x^13 -1 of P(x). So, the product is the product of P(x) evaluated at each x=\u03c9^k.\n\nBut perhaps I can think of this as evaluating the resultant of P(x) and x^13 -1. Alternatively, since the product is the same as the value of the polynomial Q(x) = product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) evaluated at x such that x^2 - 2x + 2 =0. Wait, no, that seems a bit off.\n\nWait, another thought: The product over x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the value of the polynomial x^2 - 2x + 2 evaluated at each root of x^13 -1, and then multiplied together. So, the product is equal to the resultant of x^13 -1 and x^2 - 2x +2. But I don't remember exactly how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the product over x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x +2) is equal to the product over x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x +2). Let me denote this product as Prod. Then, taking the logarithm, ln(Prod) = sum_{k=0}^{12} ln(\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). But that seems messy because we're dealing with complex logarithms.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor the quadratic. Let's see, x^2 - 2x + 2 can be written as (x - 1)^2 +1, which is (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, the roots are 1 + i and 1 - i.\n\nSo, the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)) is equal to the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i)) times the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 - i)).\n\nBut each of these products is the value of the polynomial x^13 -1 evaluated at x=1+i and x=1-i, right? Because the product over x^13=1 of (x - a) is equal to (a^13 -1) when a \u22601. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no. The product over x^13=1 of (x - a) is equal to (a^13 -1)/(a -1) when a \u22601. Because x^13 -1 = product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k). So, when x = a, it's product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 -1. But wait, no, that's not right. Because the product over (x - \u03c9^k) is x^13 -1. So, evaluating at x = a, the product is a^13 -1. So, the product over k=0 to 12 of (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 -1.\n\nBut in our case, the product over x^13=1 of (x - a) is the same as the product over k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - a). Which is equal to (-1)^13 times the product over k=0 to 12 of (a - \u03c9^k). Since (-1)^13 = -1, it's equal to -(a^13 -1) = 1 - a^13.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The product over x^13=1 of (x - a) is equal to product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = product_{k=0}^{12} ( - (a - \u03c9^k) ) = (-1)^13 product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = - (a^13 -1). So, yes, it's equal to 1 - a^13.\n\nSo, going back, the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i)) is equal to 1 - (1 + i)^13. Similarly, the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 - i)) is equal to 1 - (1 - i)^13.\n\nTherefore, the product Prod = [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13].\n\nSo, now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^13 first. Since 1 + i has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{-i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute 13 * \u03c0/4. 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, we can subtract 2\u03c0 to find the equivalent angle.\n\n3\u03c0 is 3*180 = 540 degrees, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 is 540 + 45 = 585 degrees. Subtract 360, we get 225 degrees, which is 5\u03c0/4 radians. So, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^{13}. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nLet me compute that: sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2, so 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) i = -64 i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, compute (1 - i)^13. Since 1 - i is the conjugate of 1 + i, so (1 - i)^13 will be the conjugate of (1 + i)^13.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = (-64 + 64i).\n\nNow, let's compute 1 - (1 + i)^13. That would be 1 - (-64 -64i) = 1 + 64 +64i = 65 +64i.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - (1 - i)^13 = 1 - (-64 +64i) = 1 +64 -64i = 65 -64i.\n\nSo, now the product Prod = (65 +64i)(65 -64i). That's the product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is the square of the modulus.\n\nSo, |65 +64i|^2 = (65)^2 + (64)^2.\n\nCompute 65^2: 65*65. 60^2=3600, 5^2=25, 2*60*5=600. So, (60+5)^2= 3600 +600 +25=4225.\n\n64^2: 64*64. 60^2=3600, 4^2=16, 2*60*4=480. So, (60+4)^2= 3600 +480 +16=4096.\n\nSo, 65^2 +64^2=4225 +4096=8321.\n\nTherefore, Prod = 8321.\n\nWait, but hold on. Earlier, I had that the product over x^13=1 of (x^2 -2x +2) is equal to [1 - (1 +i)^13][1 - (1 -i)^13] = (65 +64i)(65 -64i) = 8321. So, the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 -2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is 8321. But wait, in the original problem, the product was from k=0 to 12, but when I considered P_k, I realized that when k=0, P_0=1. So, the product is indeed 8321.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the remainder when [...] is divided by 1000.\" So, I need to compute 8321 mod 1000.\n\nCompute 8321 divided by 1000: 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, so the answer is 321.\n\nBut let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might have made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, so the key steps were:\n\n1. Recognize that each term is a quadratic in \u03c9^k, which is a 13th root of unity.\n\n2. Rewrite the product as the product over x^13=1 of (x^2 -2x +2), except x=1.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the initial product, k=0 to 12, which includes x=1. But when k=0, x=1, and the term is 1, so including it doesn't change the product. So, the product from k=0 to 12 is equal to the product from k=1 to 12 multiplied by 1, which is the same as the product from k=1 to 12. But when I considered the product over all x^13=1, I included x=1, which gave me the product as 8321. But actually, the product from k=0 to 12 is the same as the product over all x^13=1, which includes x=1. But in the problem, the product is from k=0 to 12, which includes x=1, which gives 1, so the product is 8321. But wait, when I calculated the product over all x^13=1, I included x=1, which gave me 8321, but the problem's product is from k=0 to 12, which is the same as the product over all x^13=1, so that should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. When I computed the product over all x^13=1 of (x^2 -2x +2), I got 8321, which includes x=1. But in the problem, the product is from k=0 to 12, which includes x=1, which is exactly the same as the product over all x^13=1. So, 8321 is the correct product, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer. But let me just check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCalculating (1 + i)^13: 1 + i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4. So, raising to 13th power gives magnitude (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2). The angle becomes 13*(\u03c0/4) = (12\u03c0/4) + \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 in terms of direction, but since it's more than 2\u03c0, we subtract 2\u03c0 to get \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant. So, cos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. So, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*( -1 -i ). So, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i). Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\nThen, 1 - (1 + i)^13 = 1 - (-64(1 +i )) = 1 +64(1 +i ) = 65 +64i. Similarly, 1 - (1 -i )^13 = 65 -64i.\n\nMultiplying these two: (65 +64i)(65 -64i) = 65^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 +4096=8321. Correct.\n\nSo, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies \u03c9^13 = 1. Also, all the roots are the solutions to the equation x^13 - 1 = 0. So, the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x), which is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. Maybe that will come in handy later.\n\nNow, the product I'm looking at is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me denote each term in the product as P_k = 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. I need to compute the product of all P_k for k=0 to 12.\n\nWait a second, when k=0, \u03c9^0 is 1, so P_0 would be 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So I can ignore k=0 because multiplying by 1 doesn't change the product. That simplifies things a bit.\n\nSo now, the product reduces to the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Hmm, that's 12 terms. Maybe I can find a pattern or a way to express this product in terms of polynomials.\n\nLet me see if I can rewrite P_k = 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} in a different way. Let me factor out a 2: P_k = 2(1 - \u03c9^k) + \u03c9^{2k}. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, I can write it as P_k = 2(1 - \u03c9^k) + (\u03c9^k)^2.\n\nWait, perhaps if I let x = \u03c9^k, then P_k becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. So, P_k = x^2 - 2x + 2. That's a quadratic in x. So, for each k, P_k is a quadratic in x = \u03c9^k.\n\nSo, the product becomes the product from x=\u03c9 to x=\u03c9^{12} of (x^2 - 2x + 2). But wait, x takes on all the 13th roots of unity except 1, since k goes from 1 to 12. So, the product is the product over all x \u2260 1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2).\n\nHmm, this seems like evaluating a polynomial at certain roots. Let me think about this. If I have a polynomial f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2, and I want to compute the product of f(x) as x ranges over all the 13th roots of unity except 1. But wait, actually, x is \u03c9^k for k=1 to 12, so they are all the 13th roots except 1.\n\nBut wait, the product over all roots x of f(x) would relate to the value of the polynomial whose roots are x=\u03c9^k, evaluated at something. Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the product over x^13 - 1 = 0 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) can be expressed as a resultant or something.\n\nWait, another approach: The product over all roots x of (x^2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over all x of f(x), where f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2, and x runs through the 13th roots of unity except 1. But since x^13 = 1, perhaps I can relate this to f(x) evaluated at x being a root of x^13 - 1.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as evaluating f(x) at each x = \u03c9^k, and then multiplying them all together. So, the product is the product from k=1 to 12 of f(\u03c9^k).\n\nBut wait, the product over all x of f(x), where x are the roots of x^13 - 1, is equal to the resultant of x^13 -1 and f(x), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the product over all x \u2260 1 of (x - a) is equal to (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) evaluated at x=a, but that's for linear factors.\n\nWait, but in this case, the factors are quadratic. So, perhaps I need a different approach. Let me think about the product over all x \u2260 1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2). That is, the product over all x where x^13 =1 and x \u22601 of (x^2 - 2x + 2).\n\nHmm, so perhaps I can write this as the product over x of (x^2 - 2x + 2), divided by the term at x=1. But the term at x=1 is (1 - 2 + 2) = 1, so that doesn't change anything. So the product is the product over all x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2).\n\nWait, but then x^13 =1, so maybe I can relate this to f(x) = x^2 -2x +2, and the product over all x^13=1 of f(x) is equal to the product of f(\u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12, which is the same as the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nWait, but that's the same as the product we have except we included k=0, which gives 1. So, the product from k=0 to 12 is equal to the product from k=1 to 12 multiplied by 1, so they are equal. Hmm, perhaps I can compute the product over all k=0 to 12, which is the same as the product over all x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x +2).\n\nBut how do I compute that product? I remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product over all roots x of (x - a) is f(a). But here, it's the product over all x^13=1 of f(x), where f(x) is another polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps using complex analysis or generating functions. Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the resultant or something else. Let me think.\n\nWait, another idea: The product over x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x +2) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^13 -1. But I'm not sure how to compute that. Alternatively, maybe using logarithms to turn the product into a sum, but that seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that for any polynomial g(x), the product of g(\u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is equal to the product of g(x) evaluated at each root of x^13 -1. There's a formula for such products in terms of the greatest common divisor or something else.\n\nWait, I think the product over all x^13=1 of (x - a) is equal to (a^13 -1)/(a -1) when a \u22601, but that's for linear factors. But in our case, the factors are quadratic. So, perhaps I can think of it as evaluating f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 at each 13th root of unity and then taking the product.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the fact that the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 -1. So, if I have a polynomial f(x), then the product over k=0 to 12 of f(\u03c9^k) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^13 -1. But I'm not sure how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the product over roots of unity of a quadratic. Let me see. Suppose I have a quadratic polynomial Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Then, for each root \u03c9^k of x^13 -1, we have Q(\u03c9^k) = (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k +2). So, the product over k=0 to 12 is the product of Q(\u03c9^k) for each k.\n\nBut how do I compute this product? Maybe using properties of polynomials.\n\nWait, another approach: For a polynomial P(x), the product of P(\u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is equal to the product over all roots of x^13 -1 of P(x). So, the product is the product of P(x) evaluated at each x=\u03c9^k.\n\nBut perhaps I can think of this as evaluating the resultant of P(x) and x^13 -1. Alternatively, since the product is the same as the value of the polynomial Q(x) = product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) evaluated at x such that x^2 - 2x + 2 =0. Wait, no, that seems a bit off.\n\nWait, another thought: The product over x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the value of the polynomial x^2 - 2x + 2 evaluated at each root of x^13 -1, and then multiplied together. So, the product is equal to the resultant of x^13 -1 and x^2 - 2x +2. But I don't remember exactly how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the product over x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x +2) is equal to the product over x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x +2). Let me denote this product as Prod. Then, taking the logarithm, ln(Prod) = sum_{k=0}^{12} ln(\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). But that seems messy because we're dealing with complex logarithms.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor the quadratic. Let's see, x^2 - 2x + 2 can be written as (x - 1)^2 +1, which is (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, the roots are 1 + i and 1 - i.\n\nSo, the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)) is equal to the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i)) times the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 - i)).\n\nBut each of these products is the value of the polynomial x^13 -1 evaluated at x=1+i and x=1-i, right? Because the product over x^13=1 of (x - a) is equal to (a^13 -1) when a \u22601. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no. The product over x^13=1 of (x - a) is equal to (a^13 -1)/(a -1) when a \u22601. Because x^13 -1 = product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k). So, when x = a, it's product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 -1. But wait, no, that's not right. Because the product over (x - \u03c9^k) is x^13 -1. So, evaluating at x = a, the product is a^13 -1. So, the product over k=0 to 12 of (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 -1.\n\nBut in our case, the product over x^13=1 of (x - a) is the same as the product over k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - a). Which is equal to (-1)^13 times the product over k=0 to 12 of (a - \u03c9^k). Since (-1)^13 = -1, it's equal to -(a^13 -1) = 1 - a^13.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The product over x^13=1 of (x - a) is equal to product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = product_{k=0}^{12} ( - (a - \u03c9^k) ) = (-1)^13 product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = - (a^13 -1). So, yes, it's equal to 1 - a^13.\n\nSo, going back, the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i)) is equal to 1 - (1 + i)^13. Similarly, the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 - i)) is equal to 1 - (1 - i)^13.\n\nTherefore, the product Prod = [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13].\n\nSo, now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^13 first. Since 1 + i has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{-i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute 13 * \u03c0/4. 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, we can subtract 2\u03c0 to find the equivalent angle.\n\n3\u03c0 is 3*180 = 540 degrees, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 is 540 + 45 = 585 degrees. Subtract 360, we get 225 degrees, which is 5\u03c0/4 radians. So, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^{13}. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nLet me compute that: sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2, so 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) i = -64 i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, compute (1 - i)^13. Since 1 - i is the conjugate of 1 + i, so (1 - i)^13 will be the conjugate of (1 + i)^13.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = (-64 + 64i).\n\nNow, let's compute 1 - (1 + i)^13. That would be 1 - (-64 -64i) = 1 + 64 +64i = 65 +64i.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - (1 - i)^13 = 1 - (-64 +64i) = 1 +64 -64i = 65 -64i.\n\nSo, now the product Prod = (65 +64i)(65 -64i). That's the product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is the square of the modulus.\n\nSo, |65 +64i|^2 = (65)^2 + (64)^2.\n\nCompute 65^2: 65*65. 60^2=3600, 5^2=25, 2*60*5=600. So, (60+5)^2= 3600 +600 +25=4225.\n\n64^2: 64*64. 60^2=3600, 4^2=16, 2*60*4=480. So, (60+4)^2= 3600 +480 +16=4096.\n\nSo, 65^2 +64^2=4225 +4096=8321.\n\nTherefore, Prod = 8321.\n\nWait, but hold on. Earlier, I had that the product over x^13=1 of (x^2 -2x +2) is equal to [1 - (1 +i)^13][1 - (1 -i)^13] = (65 +64i)(65 -64i) = 8321. So, the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 -2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is 8321. But wait, in the original problem, the product was from k=0 to 12, but when I considered P_k, I realized that when k=0, P_0=1. So, the product is indeed 8321.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the remainder when [...] is divided by 1000.\" So, I need to compute 8321 mod 1000.\n\nCompute 8321 divided by 1000: 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, so the answer is 321.\n\nBut let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might have made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, so the key steps were:\n\n1. Recognize that each term is a quadratic in \u03c9^k, which is a 13th root of unity.\n\n2. Rewrite the product as the product over x^13=1 of (x^2 -2x +2), except x=1.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the initial product, k=0 to 12, which includes x=1. But when k=0, x=1, and the term is 1, so including it doesn't change the product. So, the product from k=0 to 12 is equal to the product from k=1 to 12 multiplied by 1, which is the same as the product from k=1 to 12. But when I considered the product over all x^13=1, I included x=1, which gave me the product as 8321. But actually, the product from k=0 to 12 is the same as the product over all x^13=1, which includes x=1. But in the problem, the product is from k=0 to 12, which includes x=1, which gives 1, so the product is 8321. But wait, when I calculated the product over all x^13=1, I included x=1, which gave me 8321, but the problem's product is from k=0 to 12, which is the same as the product over all x^13=1, so that should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. When I computed the product over all x^13=1 of (x^2 -2x +2), I got 8321, which includes x=1. But in the problem, the product is from k=0 to 12, which includes x=1, which is exactly the same as the product over all x^13=1. So, 8321 is the correct product, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer. But let me just check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCalculating (1 + i)^13: 1 + i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4. So, raising to 13th power gives magnitude (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2). The angle becomes 13*(\u03c0/4) = (12\u03c0/4) + \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 in terms of direction, but since it's more than 2\u03c0, we subtract 2\u03c0 to get \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant. So, cos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. So, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*( -1 -i ). So, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i). Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\nThen, 1 - (1 + i)^13 = 1 - (-64(1 +i )) = 1 +64(1 +i ) = 65 +64i. Similarly, 1 - (1 -i )^13 = 65 -64i.\n\nMultiplying these two: (65 +64i)(65 -64i) = 65^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 +4096=8321. Correct.\n\nSo, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega\\) is a 13th root of unity not equal to 1.\n\n1. **Simplify the Product**:  \n   Notice that when \\(k=0\\), the term is \\(2 - 2\\omega^0 + \\omega^{0} = 1\\). Thus, the product simplifies to \\(\\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\).\n\n2. **Express Each Term as a Quadratic**:  \n   Let \\(x = \\omega^k\\). Each term becomes \\(P_k = x^2 - 2x + 2\\). The product becomes \\(\\prod_{k=1}^{12}(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\), where \\(x\\) are the 13th roots of unity except 1.\n\n3. **Relate to Polynomial Evaluation**:  \n   The product \\(\\prod_{x^13=1}(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\) can be evaluated by recognizing it as the product over all 13th roots of unity. This product is equivalent to \\([1 - (1+i)^{13}][1 - (1-i)^{13}]\\), where \\(1+i\\) and \\(1-i\\) are the roots of \\(x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0\\).\n\n4. **Compute Powers of \\(1+i\\) and \\(1-i\\)**:  \n   Using polar form, \\((1+i)^{13} = -64(1+i)\\) and \\((1-i)^{13} = -64(1-i)\\). Thus, \\(1 - (1+i)^{13} = 65 + 64i\\) and \\(1 - (1-i)^{13} = 65 - 64i\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Product**:  \n   The product \\((65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65^2 + 64^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321\\).\n\n6. **Find the Remainder**:  \n   Finally, compute \\(8321 \\mod 1000\\). Dividing 8321 by 1000 gives a remainder of 321.\n\nThus, the remainder is \\(\\boxed{321}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that seems a bit intimidating at first, but maybe I can break it down.\n\nFirst, I know that \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, which means \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k \u2260 1 for any k from 1 to 12. Also, the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. That might come in handy later.\n\nNow, the product is given by \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me write this out more clearly. So, for each k, I have a term (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Since k runs from 0 to 12, that's 13 terms multiplied together. \n\nI wonder if I can factor this expression somehow. Let me see: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me rearrange the terms: \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in terms of \u03c9^k. Maybe I can factor it as a quadratic?\n\nLet me denote z = \u03c9^k. Then, the expression becomes z\u00b2 - 2z + 2. Let's try to factor this quadratic. The discriminant is (\u22122)^2 \u2212 4*1*2 = 4 \u2212 8 = \u22124, which is negative, so it doesn't factor over the reals. But maybe over complex numbers? Or perhaps I can relate it to some roots of unity?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a polynomial whose roots are these expressions. Wait, but since I'm taking the product over all k, perhaps there's a connection to the minimal polynomial or cyclotomic polynomial.\n\nWait, another thought: since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, \u03c9^k for k from 0 to 12 are all the distinct roots, except \u03c9^0 = 1. So, the product is over all these roots, each plugged into the expression (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nWait, another approach: Let me think about the product over all (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is equal to x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1. But in this case, the terms are not linear in \u03c9^k, but quadratic. So maybe I can relate this product to some polynomial evaluated at certain points.\n\nWait, let me think about the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - b\u03c9^k + c\u03c9^{2k}). Hmm, but in our case, a=2, b=-2, c=1. Maybe there's a way to express this product in terms of cyclotomic polynomials or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 + \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k). Maybe I can factor 2 as a common term or something. Wait, 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} can be rewritten as 2(1 - \u03c9^k) + \u03c9^{2k}.\n\nAlternatively, factor out a \u03c9^{2k} term: \u03c9^{2k}(2\u03c9^{-2k} - 2\u03c9^{-k} + 1). Not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} as something squared or related to a square. Let me see: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = (\u03c9^k - 1)^2 + 1. Because (\u03c9^k -1)^2 = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k +1, so adding 1 gives \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k +2. Wait, that's exactly the expression we have. So, 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = (\u03c9^k - 1)^2 + 1.\n\nHmm, interesting. So each term in the product is (\u03c9^k - 1)^2 + 1. So the entire product is \u220f_{k=0}^{12} [(\u03c9^k - 1)^2 + 1].\n\nBut wait, let's see for k=0: \u03c9^0 =1, so (1-1)^2 +1 = 0 +1=1. So the term when k=0 is 1. So the product is actually 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of [(\u03c9^k -1)^2 +1]. Because when k=0, it's 1, so we can separate that out.\n\nSo, the entire product is equal to 1 * \u220f_{k=1}^{12} [(\u03c9^k -1)^2 +1] = \u220f_{k=1}^{12} [(\u03c9^k -1)^2 +1].\n\nHmm, so I need to compute the product from k=1 to 12 of [(\u03c9^k -1)^2 +1].\n\nLet me think about this. Let me denote z = \u03c9^k. Then, each term is (z -1)^2 +1 = z\u00b2 -2z +2.\n\nSo, the product becomes \u220f_{z\u22601} (z\u00b2 - 2z +2), where z runs over all 13th roots of unity except z=1.\n\nWait, but z runs over all the primitive 13th roots, which are the same as \u03c9^k for k=1 to 12. So, this is the product over all roots z of \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) of (z\u00b2 -2z +2). Hmm, but \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the minimal polynomial, which is x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... +x +1.\n\nWait, so perhaps I can relate this product to evaluating another polynomial at a certain point.\n\nI remember that if you have a polynomial P(x) with roots r_1, r_2, ..., r_n, then the product of (x - r_i) is P(x). But in this case, I have the product of (z\u00b2 - 2z +2) for each root z of \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x). So, maybe I can consider the product as evaluating another polynomial at a specific point.\n\nWait, suppose I consider the product \u220f_{z} (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2), where z are the roots of \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x). That product would be equal to the resultant of \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) and the polynomial Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x +2. Alternatively, it's the product of Q(z) for all roots z of \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x). \n\nI think that the product over all roots z of \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) of Q(z) is equal to the resultant of \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) and Q(x). Or perhaps, more directly, it's the value of the resultant Res(\u03a6\u2081\u2083, Q), which is the product of Q(z) for each root z of \u03a6\u2081\u2083.\n\nAnother approach: Since \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the minimal polynomial, which is the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=1 to 12, because \u03c9^0=1 is excluded. So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k).\n\nSo, then, the product we're looking for is \u220f_{k=1}^{12} Q(\u03c9^k) where Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x +2.\n\nSo, that product is equal to \u220f_{k=1}^{12} Q(\u03c9^k). \n\nBut how do I compute that? Maybe I can relate it to evaluating Q(x) at each root and multiplying them together.\n\nI remember that if I have a polynomial P(x) = \u220f_{k=1}^{n} (x - a_k), then the product of Q(a_k) is equal to the resultant of P and Q, which is Res(P, Q). Alternatively, I can think of it as the product of Q(a_k) for each root a_k of P.\n\nBut I'm not exactly sure about the properties of resultants here. Maybe another approach: Since \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) divides x^13 -1, and x^13 -1 = (x -1)\u03a6\u2081\u2083(x). So, perhaps I can use some properties of cyclotomic polynomials.\n\nWait, another thought: Let me consider the product \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). That is, each term is Q(\u03c9^k) where Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nIf I can find a polynomial whose roots are \u03c9^k, then evaluating Q at each root and taking the product would be the same as evaluating the resultant of \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) and Q(x). Alternatively, I can think of it as the absolute value squared or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, I remember that for a polynomial P(x) with roots r_i, the product of Q(r_i) is equal to the resultant of P and Q. The resultant can be computed as the determinant of the Sylvester matrix, but that might be complicated here.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that the product over all roots r_i of Q(r_i) is equal to the product of Q(r_i) = product (r_i\u00b2 - 2r_i + 2). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write Q(x) = (x - a)(x - b), where a and b are roots of Q(x). Then, the product over all roots r_i of Q(r_i) is equal to the product over (r_i - a)(r_i - b). Which is equal to [\u03a6\u2081\u2083(a)] * [\u03a6\u2081\u2083(b)]. Because \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the product over (x - \u03c9^k), so \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) is the product over (a - \u03c9^k), which is exactly the product over (r_i - a). Similarly for \u03a6\u2081\u2083(b).\n\nSo, in this case, Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x +2, which factors as (x - a)(x - b), where a and b are the roots of Q(x). Let's compute a and b.\n\nThe roots of Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x +2 are found using quadratic formula: [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, a = 1 + i, b = 1 - i.\n\nTherefore, the product \u220f_{k=1}^{12} Q(\u03c9^k) = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(b).\n\nSo, now I need to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i), then multiply them together.\n\nWhat's \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x)? It's the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + x\u00b9\u2070 + ... + x + 1.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1). Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the minimal polynomial.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]/[(1 + i) - 1] = [(1 + i)^13 -1]/(i). Similarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [(1 - i)^13 -1]/[-i].\n\nSo, let's compute each of these.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13. Let's note that 1 + i has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * (cos(n\u03c0/4) + i sin(n\u03c0/4)).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * [cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4)]. Let's compute 13\u03c0/4. 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. So, cos(13\u03c0/4) = cos(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = cos(\u03c0/4)cos(3\u03c0) - sin(\u03c0/4)sin(3\u03c0) = (sqrt(2)/2)(-1) - (sqrt(2)/2)(0) = -sqrt(2)/2. Similarly, sin(13\u03c0/4) = sin(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = sin(\u03c0/4)cos(3\u03c0) + cos(\u03c0/4)sin(3\u03c0) = (sqrt(2)/2)(-1) + (sqrt(2)/2)(0) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nCompute the terms inside the brackets: (-sqrt(2)/2) = -1/sqrt(2), so:\n\n= 64 * sqrt(2) [ (-1/sqrt(2)) + i (-1/sqrt(2)) ]\n= 64 * sqrt(2) * (-1/sqrt(2)) (1 + i)\n= 64 * (-1) (1 + i)\n= -64(1 + i)\n\nSimilarly, compute (1 - i)^13.\n\nSince 1 - i is the conjugate of 1 + i, its magnitude is also sqrt(2), and its angle is -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 [ cos(-13\u03c0/4) + i sin(-13\u03c0/4) ].\n\nAgain, cos(-13\u03c0/4) = cos(13\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(-13\u03c0/4) = -sin(13\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nWait, actually, cos is even and sin is odd, so cos(-\u03b8) = cos\u03b8, sin(-\u03b8) = -sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, cos(-13\u03c0/4) = cos(13\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(-13\u03c0/4) = -sin(13\u03c0/4) = -(-sqrt(2)/2) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's compute 13\u03c0/4 again. 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. So, cos(13\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(13\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, cos(-13\u03c0/4) = cos(13\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(-13\u03c0/4) = -sin(13\u03c0/4) = -(-sqrt(2)/2) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nAgain, (sqrt(2))^13 is 64 * sqrt(2), so:\n\n= 64 * sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ]\n= 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) (1 - i)\n= 64 * (-1) (1 - i)\n= -64(1 - i)\n\nSo, now, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] / ( (1 + i) -1 ) = [ -64(1 + i) -1 ] / (i )\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ] / ( (1 - i) -1 ) = [ -64(1 - i) -1 ] / (-i )\n\nLet me compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) first.\n\nCompute numerator: -64(1 + i) -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nDenominator: (1 + i) -1 = i.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = (-65 -64i)/i.\n\nDividing by i is the same as multiplying numerator and denominator by -i:\n\n= (-65 -64i)(-i) / (i * -i) = (65i +64i\u00b2) / 1.\n\nSince i\u00b2 = -1, 64i\u00b2 = -64.\n\nSo, numerator: 65i -64.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = (-64 +65i).\n\nSimilarly, compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i):\n\nNumerator: -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nDenominator: (1 - i) -1 = -i.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i).\n\nDivide by -i: multiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n= (-65 +64i)i / (-i * i) = (-65i +64i\u00b2)/1.\n\nAgain, i\u00b2 = -1, so 64i\u00b2 = -64.\n\nNumerator: -65i -64.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = (-64 -65i).\n\nWait, wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [ -64(1 -i) -1 ] / (-i )\n\nSo, numerator: -64(1 -i) = -64 +64i; subtract 1: -65 +64i.\n\nDenominator: -i.\n\nSo, (-65 +64i)/(-i) = (65 -64i)/i.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n= (65i -64i\u00b2)/(-i\u00b2) = (65i +64)/1, since i\u00b2 = -1, so denominator is 1.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = 64 +65i.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recompute:\n\n\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ] / ( (1 - i) -1 )\n\nWe have (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 -i). So,\n\nNumerator: -64(1 -i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nDenominator: (1 -i) -1 = -i.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 -i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i) = (65 -64i)/i.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n= (65i -64i\u00b2)/(-i\u00b2) = (65i +64)/1, since i\u00b2 = -1, so denominator is 1.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 -i) = 64 +65i.\n\nWait, that seems different from what I had before. So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 +i) = (-64 +65i), \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 -i) = (64 +65i).\n\nSo, the product \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(b) = (-64 +65i)(64 +65i).\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nLet me denote A = (-64 +65i), B = (64 +65i).\n\nA * B = (-64)(64) + (-64)(65i) + (65i)(64) + (65i)(65i)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (-64)(64) = -4096.\n\nSecond term: (-64)(65i) = -4160i.\n\nThird term: (65i)(64) = 4160i.\n\nFourth term: (65i)(65i) = (65)^2 (i^2) = 4225 (-1) = -4225.\n\nNow, add all terms:\n\n-4096 -4160i +4160i -4225.\n\nThe imaginary parts cancel: -4160i +4160i =0.\n\nSo, we have -4096 -4225 = (-4096 -4225) = -8321.\n\nSo, the product \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(b) = -8321.\n\nBut wait, that's the product \u220f_{k=1}^{12} Q(\u03c9^k) = -8321.\n\nSo, going back to the original product: \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 -2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = 1 * (-8321) = -8321.\n\nBut the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, -8321 mod 1000.\n\nCompute -8321 divided by 1000: 8321 /1000=8*1000 + 321, so 8321=8*1000 + 321. So, -8321 = -8*1000 -321.\n\nBut in mod 1000, -8321 \u2261 (-321) mod 1000. But negative numbers can be converted by adding 1000: -321 +1000=679.\n\nSo, the remainder is 679.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the calculation:\n\n-8321 divided by 1000 is -8.321. So, the integer part is -9, because -8.321 is between -8 and -9. Wait, no, wait: when computing mod 1000, the remainder should be between 0 and 999.\n\nSo, to find -8321 mod 1000:\n\nCompute 8321 mod 1000: 8321 \u00f71000=8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321, so 8321 \u2261321 mod1000. Therefore, -8321 \u2261 -321 mod1000. To make it positive, add 1000: -321 +1000=679.\n\nSo, yes, the remainder is 679.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the product \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(b). Earlier, I computed A = (-64 +65i), B = (64 +65i). Then, A * B = (-64)(64) + (-64)(65i) + (65i)(64) + (65i)(65i) = (-4096) + (-4160i) +4160i + (-4225) = (-4096 -4225) = -8321.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product is -8321, and mod 1000 is 679.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier: Let me retrace.\n\nWe had Q(x) =x\u00b2 -2x +2, with roots a=1+i, b=1-i.\n\n\u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial.\n\nWe found that \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = (-64 +65i), \u03a6\u2081\u2083(b)= (64 +65i).\n\nMultiplying them gives (-64 +65i)(64 +65i) = (-64)(64) + (-64)(65i) + (65i)(64) + (65i)(65i).\n\n= (-4096) + (-4160i) + (4160i) + (-4225).\n\nThe imaginary terms cancel, so -4096 -4225 = -8321.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the product is -8321, and mod 1000 is 679.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 679.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that seems a bit intimidating at first, but maybe I can break it down.\n\nFirst, I know that \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, which means \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k \u2260 1 for any k from 1 to 12. Also, the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. That might come in handy later.\n\nNow, the product is given by \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me write this out more clearly. So, for each k, I have a term (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Since k runs from 0 to 12, that's 13 terms multiplied together. \n\nI wonder if I can factor this expression somehow. Let me see: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me rearrange the terms: \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in terms of \u03c9^k. Maybe I can factor it as a quadratic?\n\nLet me denote z = \u03c9^k. Then, the expression becomes z\u00b2 - 2z + 2. Let's try to factor this quadratic. The discriminant is (\u22122)^2 \u2212 4*1*2 = 4 \u2212 8 = \u22124, which is negative, so it doesn't factor over the reals. But maybe over complex numbers? Or perhaps I can relate it to some roots of unity?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a polynomial whose roots are these expressions. Wait, but since I'm taking the product over all k, perhaps there's a connection to the minimal polynomial or cyclotomic polynomial.\n\nWait, another thought: since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, \u03c9^k for k from 0 to 12 are all the distinct roots, except \u03c9^0 = 1. So, the product is over all these roots, each plugged into the expression (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nWait, another approach: Let me think about the product over all (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is equal to x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1. But in this case, the terms are not linear in \u03c9^k, but quadratic. So maybe I can relate this product to some polynomial evaluated at certain points.\n\nWait, let me think about the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - b\u03c9^k + c\u03c9^{2k}). Hmm, but in our case, a=2, b=-2, c=1. Maybe there's a way to express this product in terms of cyclotomic polynomials or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 + \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k). Maybe I can factor 2 as a common term or something. Wait, 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} can be rewritten as 2(1 - \u03c9^k) + \u03c9^{2k}.\n\nAlternatively, factor out a \u03c9^{2k} term: \u03c9^{2k}(2\u03c9^{-2k} - 2\u03c9^{-k} + 1). Not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} as something squared or related to a square. Let me see: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = (\u03c9^k - 1)^2 + 1. Because (\u03c9^k -1)^2 = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k +1, so adding 1 gives \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k +2. Wait, that's exactly the expression we have. So, 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = (\u03c9^k - 1)^2 + 1.\n\nHmm, interesting. So each term in the product is (\u03c9^k - 1)^2 + 1. So the entire product is \u220f_{k=0}^{12} [(\u03c9^k - 1)^2 + 1].\n\nBut wait, let's see for k=0: \u03c9^0 =1, so (1-1)^2 +1 = 0 +1=1. So the term when k=0 is 1. So the product is actually 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of [(\u03c9^k -1)^2 +1]. Because when k=0, it's 1, so we can separate that out.\n\nSo, the entire product is equal to 1 * \u220f_{k=1}^{12} [(\u03c9^k -1)^2 +1] = \u220f_{k=1}^{12} [(\u03c9^k -1)^2 +1].\n\nHmm, so I need to compute the product from k=1 to 12 of [(\u03c9^k -1)^2 +1].\n\nLet me think about this. Let me denote z = \u03c9^k. Then, each term is (z -1)^2 +1 = z\u00b2 -2z +2.\n\nSo, the product becomes \u220f_{z\u22601} (z\u00b2 - 2z +2), where z runs over all 13th roots of unity except z=1.\n\nWait, but z runs over all the primitive 13th roots, which are the same as \u03c9^k for k=1 to 12. So, this is the product over all roots z of \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) of (z\u00b2 -2z +2). Hmm, but \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the minimal polynomial, which is x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... +x +1.\n\nWait, so perhaps I can relate this product to evaluating another polynomial at a certain point.\n\nI remember that if you have a polynomial P(x) with roots r_1, r_2, ..., r_n, then the product of (x - r_i) is P(x). But in this case, I have the product of (z\u00b2 - 2z +2) for each root z of \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x). So, maybe I can consider the product as evaluating another polynomial at a specific point.\n\nWait, suppose I consider the product \u220f_{z} (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2), where z are the roots of \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x). That product would be equal to the resultant of \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) and the polynomial Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x +2. Alternatively, it's the product of Q(z) for all roots z of \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x). \n\nI think that the product over all roots z of \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) of Q(z) is equal to the resultant of \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) and Q(x). Or perhaps, more directly, it's the value of the resultant Res(\u03a6\u2081\u2083, Q), which is the product of Q(z) for each root z of \u03a6\u2081\u2083.\n\nAnother approach: Since \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the minimal polynomial, which is the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=1 to 12, because \u03c9^0=1 is excluded. So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k).\n\nSo, then, the product we're looking for is \u220f_{k=1}^{12} Q(\u03c9^k) where Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x +2.\n\nSo, that product is equal to \u220f_{k=1}^{12} Q(\u03c9^k). \n\nBut how do I compute that? Maybe I can relate it to evaluating Q(x) at each root and multiplying them together.\n\nI remember that if I have a polynomial P(x) = \u220f_{k=1}^{n} (x - a_k), then the product of Q(a_k) is equal to the resultant of P and Q, which is Res(P, Q). Alternatively, I can think of it as the product of Q(a_k) for each root a_k of P.\n\nBut I'm not exactly sure about the properties of resultants here. Maybe another approach: Since \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) divides x^13 -1, and x^13 -1 = (x -1)\u03a6\u2081\u2083(x). So, perhaps I can use some properties of cyclotomic polynomials.\n\nWait, another thought: Let me consider the product \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). That is, each term is Q(\u03c9^k) where Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nIf I can find a polynomial whose roots are \u03c9^k, then evaluating Q at each root and taking the product would be the same as evaluating the resultant of \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) and Q(x). Alternatively, I can think of it as the absolute value squared or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, I remember that for a polynomial P(x) with roots r_i, the product of Q(r_i) is equal to the resultant of P and Q. The resultant can be computed as the determinant of the Sylvester matrix, but that might be complicated here.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that the product over all roots r_i of Q(r_i) is equal to the product of Q(r_i) = product (r_i\u00b2 - 2r_i + 2). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write Q(x) = (x - a)(x - b), where a and b are roots of Q(x). Then, the product over all roots r_i of Q(r_i) is equal to the product over (r_i - a)(r_i - b). Which is equal to [\u03a6\u2081\u2083(a)] * [\u03a6\u2081\u2083(b)]. Because \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the product over (x - \u03c9^k), so \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) is the product over (a - \u03c9^k), which is exactly the product over (r_i - a). Similarly for \u03a6\u2081\u2083(b).\n\nSo, in this case, Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x +2, which factors as (x - a)(x - b), where a and b are the roots of Q(x). Let's compute a and b.\n\nThe roots of Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x +2 are found using quadratic formula: [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, a = 1 + i, b = 1 - i.\n\nTherefore, the product \u220f_{k=1}^{12} Q(\u03c9^k) = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(b).\n\nSo, now I need to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i), then multiply them together.\n\nWhat's \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x)? It's the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + x\u00b9\u2070 + ... + x + 1.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1). Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the minimal polynomial.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]/[(1 + i) - 1] = [(1 + i)^13 -1]/(i). Similarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [(1 - i)^13 -1]/[-i].\n\nSo, let's compute each of these.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13. Let's note that 1 + i has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * (cos(n\u03c0/4) + i sin(n\u03c0/4)).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * [cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4)]. Let's compute 13\u03c0/4. 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. So, cos(13\u03c0/4) = cos(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = cos(\u03c0/4)cos(3\u03c0) - sin(\u03c0/4)sin(3\u03c0) = (sqrt(2)/2)(-1) - (sqrt(2)/2)(0) = -sqrt(2)/2. Similarly, sin(13\u03c0/4) = sin(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = sin(\u03c0/4)cos(3\u03c0) + cos(\u03c0/4)sin(3\u03c0) = (sqrt(2)/2)(-1) + (sqrt(2)/2)(0) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nCompute the terms inside the brackets: (-sqrt(2)/2) = -1/sqrt(2), so:\n\n= 64 * sqrt(2) [ (-1/sqrt(2)) + i (-1/sqrt(2)) ]\n= 64 * sqrt(2) * (-1/sqrt(2)) (1 + i)\n= 64 * (-1) (1 + i)\n= -64(1 + i)\n\nSimilarly, compute (1 - i)^13.\n\nSince 1 - i is the conjugate of 1 + i, its magnitude is also sqrt(2), and its angle is -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 [ cos(-13\u03c0/4) + i sin(-13\u03c0/4) ].\n\nAgain, cos(-13\u03c0/4) = cos(13\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(-13\u03c0/4) = -sin(13\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nWait, actually, cos is even and sin is odd, so cos(-\u03b8) = cos\u03b8, sin(-\u03b8) = -sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, cos(-13\u03c0/4) = cos(13\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(-13\u03c0/4) = -sin(13\u03c0/4) = -(-sqrt(2)/2) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's compute 13\u03c0/4 again. 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. So, cos(13\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(13\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, cos(-13\u03c0/4) = cos(13\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(-13\u03c0/4) = -sin(13\u03c0/4) = -(-sqrt(2)/2) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nAgain, (sqrt(2))^13 is 64 * sqrt(2), so:\n\n= 64 * sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ]\n= 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) (1 - i)\n= 64 * (-1) (1 - i)\n= -64(1 - i)\n\nSo, now, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] / ( (1 + i) -1 ) = [ -64(1 + i) -1 ] / (i )\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ] / ( (1 - i) -1 ) = [ -64(1 - i) -1 ] / (-i )\n\nLet me compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) first.\n\nCompute numerator: -64(1 + i) -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nDenominator: (1 + i) -1 = i.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = (-65 -64i)/i.\n\nDividing by i is the same as multiplying numerator and denominator by -i:\n\n= (-65 -64i)(-i) / (i * -i) = (65i +64i\u00b2) / 1.\n\nSince i\u00b2 = -1, 64i\u00b2 = -64.\n\nSo, numerator: 65i -64.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = (-64 +65i).\n\nSimilarly, compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i):\n\nNumerator: -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nDenominator: (1 - i) -1 = -i.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i).\n\nDivide by -i: multiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n= (-65 +64i)i / (-i * i) = (-65i +64i\u00b2)/1.\n\nAgain, i\u00b2 = -1, so 64i\u00b2 = -64.\n\nNumerator: -65i -64.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = (-64 -65i).\n\nWait, wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [ -64(1 -i) -1 ] / (-i )\n\nSo, numerator: -64(1 -i) = -64 +64i; subtract 1: -65 +64i.\n\nDenominator: -i.\n\nSo, (-65 +64i)/(-i) = (65 -64i)/i.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n= (65i -64i\u00b2)/(-i\u00b2) = (65i +64)/1, since i\u00b2 = -1, so denominator is 1.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = 64 +65i.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recompute:\n\n\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ] / ( (1 - i) -1 )\n\nWe have (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 -i). So,\n\nNumerator: -64(1 -i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nDenominator: (1 -i) -1 = -i.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 -i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i) = (65 -64i)/i.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n= (65i -64i\u00b2)/(-i\u00b2) = (65i +64)/1, since i\u00b2 = -1, so denominator is 1.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 -i) = 64 +65i.\n\nWait, that seems different from what I had before. So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 +i) = (-64 +65i), \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 -i) = (64 +65i).\n\nSo, the product \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(b) = (-64 +65i)(64 +65i).\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nLet me denote A = (-64 +65i), B = (64 +65i).\n\nA * B = (-64)(64) + (-64)(65i) + (65i)(64) + (65i)(65i)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (-64)(64) = -4096.\n\nSecond term: (-64)(65i) = -4160i.\n\nThird term: (65i)(64) = 4160i.\n\nFourth term: (65i)(65i) = (65)^2 (i^2) = 4225 (-1) = -4225.\n\nNow, add all terms:\n\n-4096 -4160i +4160i -4225.\n\nThe imaginary parts cancel: -4160i +4160i =0.\n\nSo, we have -4096 -4225 = (-4096 -4225) = -8321.\n\nSo, the product \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(b) = -8321.\n\nBut wait, that's the product \u220f_{k=1}^{12} Q(\u03c9^k) = -8321.\n\nSo, going back to the original product: \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 -2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = 1 * (-8321) = -8321.\n\nBut the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, -8321 mod 1000.\n\nCompute -8321 divided by 1000: 8321 /1000=8*1000 + 321, so 8321=8*1000 + 321. So, -8321 = -8*1000 -321.\n\nBut in mod 1000, -8321 \u2261 (-321) mod 1000. But negative numbers can be converted by adding 1000: -321 +1000=679.\n\nSo, the remainder is 679.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the calculation:\n\n-8321 divided by 1000 is -8.321. So, the integer part is -9, because -8.321 is between -8 and -9. Wait, no, wait: when computing mod 1000, the remainder should be between 0 and 999.\n\nSo, to find -8321 mod 1000:\n\nCompute 8321 mod 1000: 8321 \u00f71000=8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321, so 8321 \u2261321 mod1000. Therefore, -8321 \u2261 -321 mod1000. To make it positive, add 1000: -321 +1000=679.\n\nSo, yes, the remainder is 679.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the product \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(b). Earlier, I computed A = (-64 +65i), B = (64 +65i). Then, A * B = (-64)(64) + (-64)(65i) + (65i)(64) + (65i)(65i) = (-4096) + (-4160i) +4160i + (-4225) = (-4096 -4225) = -8321.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product is -8321, and mod 1000 is 679.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier: Let me retrace.\n\nWe had Q(x) =x\u00b2 -2x +2, with roots a=1+i, b=1-i.\n\n\u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial.\n\nWe found that \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = (-64 +65i), \u03a6\u2081\u2083(b)= (64 +65i).\n\nMultiplying them gives (-64 +65i)(64 +65i) = (-64)(64) + (-64)(65i) + (65i)(64) + (65i)(65i).\n\n= (-4096) + (-4160i) + (4160i) + (-4225).\n\nThe imaginary terms cancel, so -4096 -4225 = -8321.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the product is -8321, and mod 1000 is 679.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 679.\n\n\nThe given problem involves finding the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) is a 13th root of unity.\n\nFirst, we recognize that \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning \\(\\omega^{13} = 1\\) and \\(\\omega^k \\neq 1\\) for \\(1 \\leq k \\leq 12\\). The expression \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\) can be rewritten as \\((\\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1\\). Thus, the product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} \\left[(\\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1\\right].\n\\]\n\nNoticing that when \\(k = 0\\), the term is 1, we can separate it out:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} \\left[(\\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1\\right] = 1 \\cdot \\prod_{k=1}^{12} \\left[(\\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1\\right].\n\\]\n\nLet \\(z = \\omega^k\\). Then, each term in the product is \\(z^2 - 2z + 2\\), which is a quadratic polynomial. The product can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{z \\neq 1} (z^2 - 2z + 2),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(z\\) runs over all 13th roots of unity except \\(z = 1\\). This product is equivalent to evaluating the resultant of the 13th cyclotomic polynomial \\(\\Phi_{13}(x)\\) and the quadratic polynomial \\(Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\\).\n\nThe roots of \\(Q(x)\\) are \\(a = 1 + i\\) and \\(b = 1 - i\\). Using properties of cyclotomic polynomials, we compute:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{13}(a) = \\frac{a^{13} - 1}{a - 1}, \\quad \\Phi_{13}(b) = \\frac{b^{13} - 1}{b - 1}.\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(a^{13}\\) and \\(b^{13}\\) using polar forms and simplifying, we find:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{13}(1 + i) = -64 + 65i, \\quad \\Phi_{13}(1 - i) = 64 + 65i.\n\\]\n\nMultiplying these results:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{13}(1 + i) \\cdot \\Phi_{13}(1 - i) = (-64 + 65i)(64 + 65i) = -8321.\n\\]\n\nThus, the original product is \\(-8321\\). To find the remainder when \\(-8321\\) is divided by 1000:\n\n\\[\n-8321 \\mod 1000 = (-321) \\mod 1000 = 679.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the remainder is \\(\\boxed{679}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that's a mouthful, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst off, \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity since \u03c9 \u2260 1. That means \u03c9^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. Maybe that will come into play later.\n\nThe expression I need to compute is the product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me write that out more clearly:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated, but perhaps I can factor or simplify each term. Let me first consider what each term looks like.\n\nEach term is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me factor out a 2 from the first two terms: 2(1 - \u03c9^k) + \u03c9^{2k}. Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe write each term as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote \u03b6 = \u03c9^k. Then each term is 2 - 2\u03b6 + \u03b6\u00b2. So, the term is \u03b6\u00b2 - 2\u03b6 + 2.\n\nWait, \u03b6\u00b2 - 2\u03b6 + 2. Hmm, can that be factored? Let me check the discriminant: b\u00b2 - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4. So, it factors into (\u03b6 - [1 + i])(\u03b6 - [1 - i]). Because the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, \u03b6\u00b2 - 2\u03b6 + 2 = (\u03b6 - (1 + i))(\u03b6 - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, each term in the product can be written as (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product becomes:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))]\n\nSo, that's the product of two cyclotomic-like products. I think there's a formula for products of (x - \u03c9^k) over all k, which is the cyclotomic polynomial. Let me recall that \u03a6_n(x) = \u220f_{k=0}^{\u03c6(n)} (x - \u03c9^k), but wait, no, actually \u03a6_n(x) is the minimal polynomial for primitive roots, so it's \u220f_{gcd(k,n)=1} (x - \u03c9^k). Hmm, maybe that's not directly applicable here.\n\nWait, but in our case, the product is over all k from 0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - a), where a is a constant. So, that product is equal to \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a), where \u03a6\u2081\u2083 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial. Because \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k). So, if I set x = a, then \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k). But in our case, it's \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^{13} \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = (-1)^{13} \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(a).\n\nSo, each of the two products is -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i). Therefore, the entire product is [ -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) ] * [ -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) ] = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\nSo, now I need to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i), then multiply them together.\n\nBut first, what is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x)? The 13th cyclotomic polynomial is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + x\u00b9\u2070 + ... + x + 1. Because 13 is prime, so \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1). So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = (1 + i)^12 + (1 + i)^11 + ... + (1 + i) + 1.\n\nSimilarly for \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i). Hmm, calculating this directly might be tedious, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, another approach: Since \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1), so \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(a - 1). So, for a = 1 + i, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i).\n\nSo, let me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 first.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be represented in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the angle is \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n e^{i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{i 13 \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^{13} = (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the angle 13\u03c0/4. Let's subtract multiples of 2\u03c0 to find an equivalent angle between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\n13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0). So, e^{i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i \u03c0/4} because e^{i (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i \u03c0/4} since e^{i 3\u03c0} = e^{i \u03c0} = -1.\n\nWait, wait, actually, 13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is the same as \u03c0 when considering angles modulo 2\u03c0. Wait, 3\u03c0 = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0, so subtracting 2\u03c0 once gives \u03c0. So, 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nBut wait, let me compute 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, yes, e^{i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{i 5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * ( -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-1 - i)/sqrt(2) ) ] = 64 * (-1 - i).\n\nSimilarly, compute (1 - i)^13.\n\n1 - i has modulus sqrt(2), angle -\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i 13 \u03c0/4}.\n\nAgain, 13\u03c0/4 mod 2\u03c0 is 5\u03c0/4, so e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nWhich is cos(-5\u03c0/4) + i sin(-5\u03c0/4) = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-1 + i)/sqrt(2) ) ] = 64 * (-1 + i).\n\nSo, now, compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / i = [ 64*(-1 - i) - 1 ] / i = [ -64 - 64i - 1 ] / i = [ -65 - 64i ] / i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / (-i) = [ 64*(-1 + i) - 1 ] / (-i) = [ -64 + 64i - 1 ] / (-i) = [ -65 + 64i ] / (-i).\n\nSo, let's compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i):\n\n[ -65 - 64i ] / i. Let's multiply numerator and denominator by -i to rationalize:\n\n[ (-65 - 64i)(-i) ] / (i * -i) = [65i + 64i\u00b2 ] / 1 = 65i + 64(-1) = 65i -64.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i):\n\n[ -65 + 64i ] / (-i) = multiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n[ (-65 + 64i) i ] / ( (-i) * i ) = [ -65i + 64i\u00b2 ] / 1 = -65i + 64(-1) = -65i -64.\n\nSo now, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = -64 + 65i.\n\n\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = -64 -65i.\n\nSo, the product \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = (-64 + 65i)(-64 -65i).\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to (-64)^2 + (65)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(-64)^2 = 4096.\n\n65^2 = 4225.\n\nSo, 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nTherefore, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Earlier, I had the entire product as \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i). But according to the earlier steps, the original product was equal to [ -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) ] * [ -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) ] = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i). So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, but in the product, when k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1. So, does that cause any issues?\n\nWait, when k=0, the term is 2 - 2\u03c9^0 + \u03c9^{0} = 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1.\n\nSo, that term is 1. So, the product is 1 * [product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) ].\n\nBut in the earlier steps, when I set \u03b6 = \u03c9^k, for k=0, \u03b6=1, so the term is (1 - (1 + i))(1 - (1 - i)) = (-i)(i) = 1, which matches. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the product is indeed 8321.\n\nBut wait, 8321 is the value of the product. The question asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000 leaves a remainder of 321, since 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, signs can be tricky.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = (-64 + 65i), and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = (-64 -65i). Their product is (-64)^2 + (65)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321. So, that's correct.\n\nThen 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me compute 8321 / 1000. 1000*8=8000, 8321-8000=321. Yep.\n\nSo, I think 321 is the correct answer.\n",

After calculating these evaluations and their product, we find the result modulo 1000.\n\nThe remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 321.\n\n\\boxed{321}",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that's a mouthful, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst off, \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity since \u03c9 \u2260 1. That means \u03c9^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. Maybe that will come into play later.\n\nThe expression I need to compute is the product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me write that out more clearly:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated, but perhaps I can factor or simplify each term. Let me first consider what each term looks like.\n\nEach term is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me factor out a 2 from the first two terms: 2(1 - \u03c9^k) + \u03c9^{2k}. Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe write each term as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote \u03b6 = \u03c9^k. Then each term is 2 - 2\u03b6 + \u03b6\u00b2. So, the term is \u03b6\u00b2 - 2\u03b6 + 2.\n\nWait, \u03b6\u00b2 - 2\u03b6 + 2. Hmm, can that be factored? Let me check the discriminant: b\u00b2 - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4. So, it factors into (\u03b6 - [1 + i])(\u03b6 - [1 - i]). Because the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, \u03b6\u00b2 - 2\u03b6 + 2 = (\u03b6 - (1 + i))(\u03b6 - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, each term in the product can be written as (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product becomes:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))]\n\nSo, that's the product of two cyclotomic-like products. I think there's a formula for products of (x - \u03c9^k) over all k, which is the cyclotomic polynomial. Let me recall that \u03a6_n(x) = \u220f_{k=0}^{\u03c6(n)} (x - \u03c9^k), but wait, no, actually \u03a6_n(x) is the minimal polynomial for primitive roots, so it's \u220f_{gcd(k,n)=1} (x - \u03c9^k). Hmm, maybe that's not directly applicable here.\n\nWait, but in our case, the product is over all k from 0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - a), where a is a constant. So, that product is equal to \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a), where \u03a6\u2081\u2083 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial. Because \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k). So, if I set x = a, then \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k). But in our case, it's \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^{13} \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = (-1)^{13} \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(a).\n\nSo, each of the two products is -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i). Therefore, the entire product is [ -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) ] * [ -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) ] = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\nSo, now I need to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i), then multiply them together.\n\nBut first, what is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x)? The 13th cyclotomic polynomial is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + x\u00b9\u2070 + ... + x + 1. Because 13 is prime, so \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1). So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = (1 + i)^12 + (1 + i)^11 + ... + (1 + i) + 1.\n\nSimilarly for \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i). Hmm, calculating this directly might be tedious, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, another approach: Since \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1), so \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(a - 1). So, for a = 1 + i, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i).\n\nSo, let me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 first.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be represented in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the angle is \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n e^{i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{i 13 \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^{13} = (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the angle 13\u03c0/4. Let's subtract multiples of 2\u03c0 to find an equivalent angle between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\n13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0). So, e^{i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i \u03c0/4} because e^{i (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i \u03c0/4} since e^{i 3\u03c0} = e^{i \u03c0} = -1.\n\nWait, wait, actually, 13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is the same as \u03c0 when considering angles modulo 2\u03c0. Wait, 3\u03c0 = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0, so subtracting 2\u03c0 once gives \u03c0. So, 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nBut wait, let me compute 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, yes, e^{i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{i 5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * ( -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-1 - i)/sqrt(2) ) ] = 64 * (-1 - i).\n\nSimilarly, compute (1 - i)^13.\n\n1 - i has modulus sqrt(2), angle -\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i 13 \u03c0/4}.\n\nAgain, 13\u03c0/4 mod 2\u03c0 is 5\u03c0/4, so e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nWhich is cos(-5\u03c0/4) + i sin(-5\u03c0/4) = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-1 + i)/sqrt(2) ) ] = 64 * (-1 + i).\n\nSo, now, compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / i = [ 64*(-1 - i) - 1 ] / i = [ -64 - 64i - 1 ] / i = [ -65 - 64i ] / i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / (-i) = [ 64*(-1 + i) - 1 ] / (-i) = [ -64 + 64i - 1 ] / (-i) = [ -65 + 64i ] / (-i).\n\nSo, let's compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i):\n\n[ -65 - 64i ] / i. Let's multiply numerator and denominator by -i to rationalize:\n\n[ (-65 - 64i)(-i) ] / (i * -i) = [65i + 64i\u00b2 ] / 1 = 65i + 64(-1) = 65i -64.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i):\n\n[ -65 + 64i ] / (-i) = multiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n[ (-65 + 64i) i ] / ( (-i) * i ) = [ -65i + 64i\u00b2 ] / 1 = -65i + 64(-1) = -65i -64.\n\nSo now, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = -64 + 65i.\n\n\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = -64 -65i.\n\nSo, the product \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = (-64 + 65i)(-64 -65i).\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to (-64)^2 + (65)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(-64)^2 = 4096.\n\n65^2 = 4225.\n\nSo, 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nTherefore, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Earlier, I had the entire product as \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i). But according to the earlier steps, the original product was equal to [ -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) ] * [ -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) ] = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i). So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, but in the product, when k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1. So, does that cause any issues?\n\nWait, when k=0, the term is 2 - 2\u03c9^0 + \u03c9^{0} = 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1.\n\nSo, that term is 1. So, the product is 1 * [product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) ].\n\nBut in the earlier steps, when I set \u03b6 = \u03c9^k, for k=0, \u03b6=1, so the term is (1 - (1 + i))(1 - (1 - i)) = (-i)(i) = 1, which matches. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the product is indeed 8321.\n\nBut wait, 8321 is the value of the product. The question asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000 leaves a remainder of 321, since 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, signs can be tricky.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = (-64 + 65i), and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = (-64 -65i). Their product is (-64)^2 + (65)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321. So, that's correct.\n\nThen 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me compute 8321 / 1000. 1000*8=8000, 8321-8000=321. Yep.\n\nSo, I think 321 is the correct answer.\n\n\nThe given problem involves computing the product of terms involving roots of unity and finding the remainder when divided by 1000. By expressing each term as a quadratic in \u03c9^k and leveraging properties of cyclotomic polynomials, we simplify the product to a computation involving the 13th cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at specific complex numbers. After calculating these evaluations and their product, we find the result modulo 1000.\n\nThe remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 321.\n\n\\boxed{321}",

      "reasoning_text": "Alright, so I've got this math problem here. It says, let \u03c9 not equal to 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, okay. Let's try to unpack this.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy the equation \u03c9^n = 1 for some integer n. In this case, n is 13, so \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k \u2260 1 for any k between 1 and 12.\n\nThe problem is asking for the product of terms (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) for each k from 0 to 12, and then take that product modulo 1000. So, that's a product of 13 terms, each involving powers of \u03c9.\n\nWait a second, the product is from k=0 to 12, which includes k=0. Let me compute that term separately. When k=0, \u03c9^0 is 1, so the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So effectively, the product is from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nBut perhaps it's better to keep k=0 in the product for now and see if that simplifies things later.\n\nNow, I need to compute the product P = product_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nHmm. Let me see if I can factor or manipulate this expression. Maybe I can write the term as something involving \u03c9^k.\n\nLet me denote z = \u03c9^k. Then each term becomes (2 - 2z + z^2). Let's factor that quadratic in z. Let me see: z^2 - 2z + 2. Hmm, does that factor? The discriminant is (\u22122)^2 \u2212 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4, which is negative, so it doesn't factor over the reals. So maybe I can think of it as a quadratic in z.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor the entire product. Since the product is over all 13th roots of unity, perhaps there's a clever way to relate this to a polynomial evaluated at certain points.\n\nWait, I recall that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k from 0 to 12 is x^13 - 1, but since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, the minimal polynomial is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the given product as a product over certain quadratic terms in z, where z = \u03c9^k. So each term is (2 - 2z + z^2). Let me see if I can write this as a product of two linear terms or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as (z^2 - 2z + 2), and then consider the product over all z = \u03c9^k of (z^2 - 2z + 2). Hmm, so the product becomes product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Alternatively, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nWait, maybe I can think of this as evaluating a polynomial at certain points. For example, the product over (z - a_k) is equal to the polynomial whose roots are a_k. But here, each term is a quadratic in z, so perhaps I can relate this to evaluating a polynomial at specific points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for each k, \u03c9^{13} = 1, so \u03c9^{2k} is just another root of unity. Let me see, since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, \u03c9^k for k=0 to 12 are all distinct roots, so \u03c9^{2k} is also a root, but perhaps not primitive. Wait, 2 and 13 are coprime, so \u03c9^2 is also a primitive 13th root. So \u03c9^{2k} cycles through all the 13th roots as k goes from 0 to 12.\n\nWait, so maybe the product over (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is the same as the product over (2 - 2z + z^2) where z runs through all 13th roots of unity. So that product would be the same as evaluating the product over all z of (z^2 - 2z + 2), where z^13 = 1.\n\nHmm, so maybe I can consider the product over all 13th roots of unity z of (z^2 - 2z + 2). That would be equal to the product of (z - a)(z - b), where a and b are roots of z^2 - 2z + 2 = 0. So, the product over all z of (z^2 - 2z + 2) is equal to the product over all z of (z - a)(z - b), which is the same as the product over all z of (z - a) multiplied by the product over all z of (z - b).\n\nBut the product over all z of (z - a) is equal to the value of the polynomial x^13 - 1 evaluated at x = a, because the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1. Wait, no, actually, the product over (z - a) for z being the 13th roots of unity is equal to the resultant when a is plugged into x^13 - 1. So, product_{z} (z - a) = a^13 - 1, since each z is a root of x^13 - 1 = 0.\n\nWait, yes, that makes sense. So, product_{k=0}^{12} (z - a) where z = \u03c9^k would be a^13 - 1, because the product over (z - a) is the same as substituting x = a into the polynomial whose roots are the z's, which is x^13 - 1.\n\nSo, applying that, the product over z of (z - a) is a^13 - 1. Similarly, the product over z of (z - b) is b^13 - 1.\n\nSo, the overall product would be (a^13 - 1)(b^13 - 1), where a and b are the roots of z^2 - 2z + 2 = 0.\n\nSo, first, let's find a and b. The quadratic equation is z^2 - 2z + 2 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, z = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo, a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i.\n\nSo, now, product_{z} (z^2 - 2z + 2) = product_{z} (z - a)(z - b) = (product_{z} (z - a))(product_{z} (z - b)) = (a^13 - 1)(b^13 - 1).\n\nSo, now we can compute (a^13 - 1)(b^13 - 1).\n\nBut a and b are complex numbers, 1 + i and 1 - i. Let me compute a^13 and b^13.\n\nFirst, let's compute a^13 where a = 1 + i. I know that 1 + i has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i can be written in polar form as sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, a^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the angle: 13 * \u03c0/4 = (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 * 1 + \u03c0. So, it's equivalent to \u03c0/4 + \u03c0, which is 5\u03c0/4. Because 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, a^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, multiply 64 * sqrt(2) with (-sqrt(2)/2):\n\nsqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2, so 64 * 2 * (-1/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2) * (-i/2) = 64 * (-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, a^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, compute b^13 where b = 1 - i. Since b is the conjugate of a, and exponentiation preserves conjugation, b^13 will be the conjugate of a^13.\n\nSo, a^13 = -64 -64i, so b^13 = (-64 -64i)*, which is (-64 +64i).\n\nWait, no, actually, if a = 1 + i, then b = 1 - i is its complex conjugate. So, when we raise to the 13th power, which is an odd exponent, the conjugate of a^13 is b^13. So, since a^13 = -64 -64i, then b^13 = (-64 +64i).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, when I computed a^13, I had e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} which is in the third quadrant, both real and imaginary parts negative. So, a^13 is (-64 -64i). Similarly, b = 1 - i is in polar form sqrt(2) e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so b^13 would be (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nBut 13\u03c0/4 is the same as 5\u03c0/4 when subtracting 2\u03c0, but with a negative sign. Alternatively, e^{-i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(5\u03c0/4)} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, b^13 would be 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nCalculating that:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2) * (-1/2) = -64.\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2) * (i/2) = 64i.\n\nSo, b^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, a^13 is (-64 -64i) and b^13 is (-64 +64i).\n\nWait, but let's check that:\n\nCompute a^13 = (1 + i)^13.\n\nWe can compute it using the binomial theorem, but that might take time. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the angle.\n\nWait, let's see: 1 + i has an angle of \u03c0/4, so (1 + i)^1 = \u03c0/4, (1 + i)^2 = \u03c0/2, (1 + i)^4 = \u03c0, (1 + i)^8 = 2\u03c0, etc. So, (1 + i)^13 is (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i)^4 * (1 + i)^1.\n\n(1 + i)^8 = ( (1 + i)^4 )^2. (1 + i)^4 is (sqrt(2))^4 * e^{i\u03c0} = 4 * (-1) = -4.\n\nWait, that's a better approach. Let's compute (1 + i)^n using De Moivre's theorem.\n\n(1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, for n=13, (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nThe angle is 13 * \u03c0/4. Let's compute 13 * \u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3 with remainder 1, so 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0 because 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 \u2261 \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nMultiply that out:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2) * (-1/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i) = 64 * (2) * (-1/2) i = 64 * (-1) i = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i. Similarly, (1 - i)^13 would be the conjugate, which is -64 +64i. Because (1 - i) has angle -\u03c0/4, so raising to the 13th power would give angle -13\u03c0/4, which is equivalent to -5\u03c0/4, which is the same as 3\u03c0/4, but in terms of cosine and sine, that would be cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2). Wait, but when you raise (1 - i) to the 13th power, it's (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nWait, 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, so -13\u03c0/4 is -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to \u03c0/4 when considering modulo 2\u03c0. Wait, no: let's compute -13\u03c0/4.\n\nCompute -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0/4. So, e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i \u03c0/4} * e^{-i 3\u03c0} = e^{-i \u03c0/4} * (-1), since e^{-i 3\u03c0} = e^{-i \u03c0} = -1.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i \u03c0/4} * e^{-i 3\u03c0} = e^{-i \u03c0/4} * (-1). Because e^{-i 3\u03c0} = e^{-i \u03c0} = -1.\n\nSo, e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = - e^{-i \u03c0/4} = - [cos(\u03c0/4) - i sin(\u03c0/4)] = - [sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2] = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nCompute that:\n\n(sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nMultiply by (-sqrt(2)/2):\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2) * (-1/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nMultiply by i sqrt(2)/2:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2) * (i/2) = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nWait, but that seems off because if (1 - i)^13 is the conjugate of (1 + i)^13, then since (1 + i)^13 is -64 -64i, the conjugate would be -64 +64i. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, now, (a^13 - 1) is (-64 -64i - 1) = (-65 -64i).\n\nSimilarly, (b^13 -1) is (-64 +64i -1) = (-65 +64i).\n\nSo, the product (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nCompute that: (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, that's a big number, 8321. So, the product over all z of (z^2 - 2z + 2) is 8321.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the product was (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) = 8321, but the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is the same as the product over all z of (z^2 - 2z + 2), which is 8321.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, the original product is from k=0 to 12, which includes z = \u03c9^0 = 1. So when z=1, the term is (1)^2 - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So, that term is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So, the product from k=0 to 12 is indeed 8321.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: the product over all 13th roots z of (z^2 - 2z + 2) is 8321. So, the answer is 8321.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 mod 1000.\n\nCompute 8321 divided by 1000: 8 * 1000 = 8000, so 8321 - 8000 = 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nSo, the answer is 321.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me recheck:\n\nCompute (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1):\n\na^13 = -64 -64i, so a^13 -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nb^13 = -64 +64i, so b^13 -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nMultiply them: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. That's correct.\n\nSo, 8321 mod 1000 is 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure that the initial step of transforming the product into (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) is correct.\n\nWe had product_{z} (z^2 - 2z + 2) = product_{z} (z - a)(z - b) = product_{z} (z - a) * product_{z} (z - b) = (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1). Yes, that's correct because product_{z} (z - a) is the value of the polynomial with roots z evaluated at a, which is a^13 -1, since z^13 = 1 for each root z.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct. So, the product is 8321, which leaves a remainder of 321 when divided by 1000.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning \u03c9^13 = 1 and \u03c9^k \u2260 1 for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 12.

      "full_content": "Alright, so I've got this math problem here. It says, let \u03c9 not equal to 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, okay. Let's try to unpack this.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy the equation \u03c9^n = 1 for some integer n. In this case, n is 13, so \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k \u2260 1 for any k between 1 and 12.\n\nThe problem is asking for the product of terms (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) for each k from 0 to 12, and then take that product modulo 1000. So, that's a product of 13 terms, each involving powers of \u03c9.\n\nWait a second, the product is from k=0 to 12, which includes k=0. Let me compute that term separately. When k=0, \u03c9^0 is 1, so the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So effectively, the product is from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nBut perhaps it's better to keep k=0 in the product for now and see if that simplifies things later.\n\nNow, I need to compute the product P = product_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nHmm. Let me see if I can factor or manipulate this expression. Maybe I can write the term as something involving \u03c9^k.\n\nLet me denote z = \u03c9^k. Then each term becomes (2 - 2z + z^2). Let's factor that quadratic in z. Let me see: z^2 - 2z + 2. Hmm, does that factor? The discriminant is (\u22122)^2 \u2212 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4, which is negative, so it doesn't factor over the reals. So maybe I can think of it as a quadratic in z.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor the entire product. Since the product is over all 13th roots of unity, perhaps there's a clever way to relate this to a polynomial evaluated at certain points.\n\nWait, I recall that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k from 0 to 12 is x^13 - 1, but since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, the minimal polynomial is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the given product as a product over certain quadratic terms in z, where z = \u03c9^k. So each term is (2 - 2z + z^2). Let me see if I can write this as a product of two linear terms or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as (z^2 - 2z + 2), and then consider the product over all z = \u03c9^k of (z^2 - 2z + 2). Hmm, so the product becomes product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Alternatively, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nWait, maybe I can think of this as evaluating a polynomial at certain points. For example, the product over (z - a_k) is equal to the polynomial whose roots are a_k. But here, each term is a quadratic in z, so perhaps I can relate this to evaluating a polynomial at specific points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for each k, \u03c9^{13} = 1, so \u03c9^{2k} is just another root of unity. Let me see, since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, \u03c9^k for k=0 to 12 are all distinct roots, so \u03c9^{2k} is also a root, but perhaps not primitive. Wait, 2 and 13 are coprime, so \u03c9^2 is also a primitive 13th root. So \u03c9^{2k} cycles through all the 13th roots as k goes from 0 to 12.\n\nWait, so maybe the product over (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is the same as the product over (2 - 2z + z^2) where z runs through all 13th roots of unity. So that product would be the same as evaluating the product over all z of (z^2 - 2z + 2), where z^13 = 1.\n\nHmm, so maybe I can consider the product over all 13th roots of unity z of (z^2 - 2z + 2). That would be equal to the product of (z - a)(z - b), where a and b are roots of z^2 - 2z + 2 = 0. So, the product over all z of (z^2 - 2z + 2) is equal to the product over all z of (z - a)(z - b), which is the same as the product over all z of (z - a) multiplied by the product over all z of (z - b).\n\nBut the product over all z of (z - a) is equal to the value of the polynomial x^13 - 1 evaluated at x = a, because the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1. Wait, no, actually, the product over (z - a) for z being the 13th roots of unity is equal to the resultant when a is plugged into x^13 - 1. So, product_{z} (z - a) = a^13 - 1, since each z is a root of x^13 - 1 = 0.\n\nWait, yes, that makes sense. So, product_{k=0}^{12} (z - a) where z = \u03c9^k would be a^13 - 1, because the product over (z - a) is the same as substituting x = a into the polynomial whose roots are the z's, which is x^13 - 1.\n\nSo, applying that, the product over z of (z - a) is a^13 - 1. Similarly, the product over z of (z - b) is b^13 - 1.\n\nSo, the overall product would be (a^13 - 1)(b^13 - 1), where a and b are the roots of z^2 - 2z + 2 = 0.\n\nSo, first, let's find a and b. The quadratic equation is z^2 - 2z + 2 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, z = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo, a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i.\n\nSo, now, product_{z} (z^2 - 2z + 2) = product_{z} (z - a)(z - b) = (product_{z} (z - a))(product_{z} (z - b)) = (a^13 - 1)(b^13 - 1).\n\nSo, now we can compute (a^13 - 1)(b^13 - 1).\n\nBut a and b are complex numbers, 1 + i and 1 - i. Let me compute a^13 and b^13.\n\nFirst, let's compute a^13 where a = 1 + i. I know that 1 + i has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i can be written in polar form as sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, a^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the angle: 13 * \u03c0/4 = (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 * 1 + \u03c0. So, it's equivalent to \u03c0/4 + \u03c0, which is 5\u03c0/4. Because 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, a^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, multiply 64 * sqrt(2) with (-sqrt(2)/2):\n\nsqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2, so 64 * 2 * (-1/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2) * (-i/2) = 64 * (-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, a^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, compute b^13 where b = 1 - i. Since b is the conjugate of a, and exponentiation preserves conjugation, b^13 will be the conjugate of a^13.\n\nSo, a^13 = -64 -64i, so b^13 = (-64 -64i)*, which is (-64 +64i).\n\nWait, no, actually, if a = 1 + i, then b = 1 - i is its complex conjugate. So, when we raise to the 13th power, which is an odd exponent, the conjugate of a^13 is b^13. So, since a^13 = -64 -64i, then b^13 = (-64 +64i).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, when I computed a^13, I had e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} which is in the third quadrant, both real and imaginary parts negative. So, a^13 is (-64 -64i). Similarly, b = 1 - i is in polar form sqrt(2) e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so b^13 would be (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nBut 13\u03c0/4 is the same as 5\u03c0/4 when subtracting 2\u03c0, but with a negative sign. Alternatively, e^{-i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(5\u03c0/4)} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, b^13 would be 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nCalculating that:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2) * (-1/2) = -64.\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2) * (i/2) = 64i.\n\nSo, b^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, a^13 is (-64 -64i) and b^13 is (-64 +64i).\n\nWait, but let's check that:\n\nCompute a^13 = (1 + i)^13.\n\nWe can compute it using the binomial theorem, but that might take time. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the angle.\n\nWait, let's see: 1 + i has an angle of \u03c0/4, so (1 + i)^1 = \u03c0/4, (1 + i)^2 = \u03c0/2, (1 + i)^4 = \u03c0, (1 + i)^8 = 2\u03c0, etc. So, (1 + i)^13 is (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i)^4 * (1 + i)^1.\n\n(1 + i)^8 = ( (1 + i)^4 )^2. (1 + i)^4 is (sqrt(2))^4 * e^{i\u03c0} = 4 * (-1) = -4.\n\nWait, that's a better approach. Let's compute (1 + i)^n using De Moivre's theorem.\n\n(1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, for n=13, (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nThe angle is 13 * \u03c0/4. Let's compute 13 * \u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3 with remainder 1, so 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0 because 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 \u2261 \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nMultiply that out:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2) * (-1/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i) = 64 * (2) * (-1/2) i = 64 * (-1) i = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i. Similarly, (1 - i)^13 would be the conjugate, which is -64 +64i. Because (1 - i) has angle -\u03c0/4, so raising to the 13th power would give angle -13\u03c0/4, which is equivalent to -5\u03c0/4, which is the same as 3\u03c0/4, but in terms of cosine and sine, that would be cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2). Wait, but when you raise (1 - i) to the 13th power, it's (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nWait, 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, so -13\u03c0/4 is -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to \u03c0/4 when considering modulo 2\u03c0. Wait, no: let's compute -13\u03c0/4.\n\nCompute -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0/4. So, e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i \u03c0/4} * e^{-i 3\u03c0} = e^{-i \u03c0/4} * (-1), since e^{-i 3\u03c0} = e^{-i \u03c0} = -1.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i \u03c0/4} * e^{-i 3\u03c0} = e^{-i \u03c0/4} * (-1). Because e^{-i 3\u03c0} = e^{-i \u03c0} = -1.\n\nSo, e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = - e^{-i \u03c0/4} = - [cos(\u03c0/4) - i sin(\u03c0/4)] = - [sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2] = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nCompute that:\n\n(sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nMultiply by (-sqrt(2)/2):\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2) * (-1/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nMultiply by i sqrt(2)/2:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2) * (i/2) = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nWait, but that seems off because if (1 - i)^13 is the conjugate of (1 + i)^13, then since (1 + i)^13 is -64 -64i, the conjugate would be -64 +64i. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, now, (a^13 - 1) is (-64 -64i - 1) = (-65 -64i).\n\nSimilarly, (b^13 -1) is (-64 +64i -1) = (-65 +64i).\n\nSo, the product (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nCompute that: (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, that's a big number, 8321. So, the product over all z of (z^2 - 2z + 2) is 8321.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the product was (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) = 8321, but the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is the same as the product over all z of (z^2 - 2z + 2), which is 8321.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, the original product is from k=0 to 12, which includes z = \u03c9^0 = 1. So when z=1, the term is (1)^2 - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So, that term is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So, the product from k=0 to 12 is indeed 8321.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: the product over all 13th roots z of (z^2 - 2z + 2) is 8321. So, the answer is 8321.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 mod 1000.\n\nCompute 8321 divided by 1000: 8 * 1000 = 8000, so 8321 - 8000 = 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nSo, the answer is 321.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me recheck:\n\nCompute (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1):\n\na^13 = -64 -64i, so a^13 -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nb^13 = -64 +64i, so b^13 -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nMultiply them: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. That's correct.\n\nSo, 8321 mod 1000 is 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure that the initial step of transforming the product into (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) is correct.\n\nWe had product_{z} (z^2 - 2z + 2) = product_{z} (z - a)(z - b) = product_{z} (z - a) * product_{z} (z - b) = (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1). Yes, that's correct because product_{z} (z - a) is the value of the polynomial with roots z evaluated at a, which is a^13 -1, since z^13 = 1 for each root z.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct. So, the product is 8321, which leaves a remainder of 321 when divided by 1000.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning \u03c9^13 = 1 and \u03c9^k \u2260 1 for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 12. The product we need to compute is:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\n\\]\n\nFirst, note that when k = 0, \u03c9^0 = 1, so the term becomes 2 - 2(1) + 1 = 1, which does not affect the product. Thus, we can focus on the product from k = 1 to 12.\n\nWe rewrite each term as a quadratic in z = \u03c9^k:\n\n\\[\n2 - 2z + z^2 = z^2 - 2z + 2\n\\]\n\nThe product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=1}^{12} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\n\\]\n\nwhere z runs through all 13th roots of unity except z = 1. Since the polynomial x^13 - 1 factors as (x - 1)(x^12 + x^11 + ... + 1), we consider the product over all 13th roots of unity, including z = 1, which contributes a factor of 1. Thus, the product is:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{z} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\n\\]\n\nwhere z^13 = 1.\n\nWe factor the quadratic as (z - a)(z - b), where a and b are the roots of z^2 - 2z + 2 = 0. Solving, we find a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i.\n\nThe product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{z} (z - a)(z - b) = \\left(\\prod_{z} (z - a)\\right)\\left(\\prod_{z} (z - b)\\right)\n\\]\n\nEach product over (z - a) and (z - b) is equivalent to evaluating the polynomial x^13 - 1 at x = a and x = b, respectively. Thus:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{z} (z - a) = a^{13} - 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\prod_{z} (z - b) = b^{13} - 1\n\\]\n\nCalculating a^13 and b^13:\n\n- a = 1 + i has magnitude \u221a2 and angle \u03c0/4. Thus, a^13 = (\u221a2)^13 e^{i\u00b713\u03c0/4} = -64 - 64i.\n- b = 1 - i has magnitude \u221a2 and angle -\u03c0/4. Thus, b^13 = (\u221a2)^13 e^{-i\u00b713\u03c0/4} = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\na^{13} - 1 = -65 - 64i \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b^{13} - 1 = -65 + 64i\n\\]\n\nThe product is:\n\n\\[\n(-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000:\n\n\\[\n8321 \\mod 1000 = 321\n\\]\n\nThus, the remainder is:\n\n\\boxed{321}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation x^13 = 1. These roots can be written as \u03c9^k for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 12, where \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/13). Since \u03c9 \u2260 1, we're excluding k=0, but in our product, k starts at 0, so when k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1. So, I need to evaluate the product when k=0 as well.\n\nWait, let me check what happens when k=0. The term becomes 2 - 2*(1) + (1)^2, which is 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So, the first term is 1. Then, the product from k=1 to 12 would be multiplied by this 1, so the overall product is just the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nHmm, so maybe I can simplify the expression (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) for each k. Let me see if I can factor this or write it in a different form.\n\nLet me consider the expression inside the product: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let's set x = \u03c9^k. Then, the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x\u00b2. Let me write that as x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation. Maybe I can factor it or find its roots. The quadratic is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Let me compute its discriminant: b\u00b2 - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4. So, the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, the quadratic factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Therefore, 2 - 2x + x\u00b2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, substituting back x = \u03c9^k, each term in the product becomes (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, the entire product is the product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). Since multiplication is commutative, I can separate the product into two separate products: [product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] multiplied by [product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nHmm, now I remember that for roots of unity, products over (x - \u03c9^k) can be related to cyclotomic polynomials. Specifically, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k=1 to n-1 is the cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6_n(x). But wait, in our case, n=13, so \u03a6_13(x) is the minimal polynomial for \u03c9, which is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nWait, actually, \u03a6_n(x) is the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for each primitive nth root of unity. Since 13 is prime, all roots except 1 are primitive, so \u03a6_13(x) = product from k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k). And \u03a6_13(x) is equal to x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nSo, if I have product from k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nWait, so that means product from k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6_13(x). Therefore, in our case, each of the two products is \u03a6_13 evaluated at (1 + i) and (1 - i), respectively.\n\nSo, the product we're looking for is \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nNow, let's compute \u03a6_13(x). Since 13 is prime, \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / (i).\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i).\n\nWait, let me compute both \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i is sqrt(2) * e^(i\u03c0/4). So, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^(i * 13\u03c0/4).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^(-i\u03c0/4), so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^(-i * 13\u03c0/4).\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, e^(i * 13\u03c0/4) can be simplified. Since 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^(i * 5\u03c0/4) = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^(-i * 13\u03c0/4) = e^(-i * 5\u03c0/4) = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute that: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (2)/2 ) = 64 * (-1) = -64. Similarly, the imaginary part is 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * (-i (2)/2 ) = 64 * (-i) = -64i.\n\nWait, hold on, let me recast that. Wait, (1 + i)^13 is 64*sqrt(2) multiplied by [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nSo, 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * ( (-2)/2 ) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * (-i (2)/2 ) = 64*(-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 would be the conjugate, so (-64 + 64i).\n\nWait, let me verify that: (1 - i)^13 is 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nSo, 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 ) = -64, and 64 * sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64i. So, yes, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nNow, let's compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / (i ) = [ (-64 -64i) - 1 ] / i = ( -65 -64i ) / i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ] / (-i ) = [ (-64 +64i ) -1 ] / (-i ) = ( -65 +64i ) / (-i ).\n\nSo, let's compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) first. Let's compute (-65 -64i)/i.\n\nDividing by i is the same as multiplying numerator and denominator by -i, since 1/i = -i. So,\n\n(-65 -64i)/i = (-65 -64i) * (-i) / (i * -i) = (-65 -64i)*(-i) / 1 = (65i + 64i\u00b2).\n\nSince i\u00b2 = -1, this becomes 65i + 64*(-1) = -64 + 65i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) is ( -65 +64i ) / (-i ). Let's compute that.\n\nAgain, 1/(-i) is equal to i, since 1/i = -i, so 1/(-i) = i.\n\nSo, ( -65 +64i ) / (-i ) = ( -65 +64i ) * i = (-65i + 64i\u00b2) = (-65i -64) because i\u00b2 = -1.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = -64 -65i.\n\nNow, our original product is \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) = (-64 +65i) * (-64 -65i).\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nAlternatively, it's ( (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 ) = 4096 - (4225 * (-1)) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nWait, let me compute that step by step.\n\n(-64 +65i) * (-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 + (65i)^2 - (64)(65i) + (65i)(64). Wait, no, that's not the right expansion.\n\nWait, actually, it's (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2. Here, a = -64, b = 65i. So, a\u00b2 is (-64)^2 = 4096. b\u00b2 is (65i)^2 = 4225 * i\u00b2 = -4225. So, a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 4096 - (-4225) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that multiplication:\n\n(-64 +65i) * (-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 + (-64)(-65i) + (65i)(-64) + (65i)(-65i).\n\nCompute term by term:\n\nFirst term: (-64)^2 = 4096.\n\nSecond term: (-64)*(-65i) = 4160i.\n\nThird term: 65i*(-64) = -4160i.\n\nFourth term: 65i*(-65i) = -4225i\u00b2 = -4225*(-1) = 4225.\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\n4096 + 4160i -4160i +4225 = 4096 + 0i +4225 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Now, the problem is to find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000. The remainder is the last three digits. Since 8321 = 8*1000 + 321, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. 1000 * 8 = 8000. 8321 - 8000 = 321. Yes, so the remainder is 321.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 321.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes earlier. Let me retrace my steps.\n\n1. I started by noting that \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity.\n\n2. The product is over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\n3. When k=0, the term is 1, so the product is 1 * product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\n4. Then, I rewrote each term as x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 where x = \u03c9^k.\n\n5. Factored it as (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)).\n\n6. Therefore, the product becomes product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1+i))(\u03c9^k - (1-i)).\n\n7. Since the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k=1 to 12 is \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 -1)/(x -1).\n\n8. So, each of the two products is \u03a6_13(1+i) and \u03a6_13(1-i).\n\n9. Then, I computed \u03a6_13(1+i) and \u03a6_13(1-i) by expressing (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13, which involved converting them to polar form and raising to the 13th power.\n\n10. Calculated (1+i)^13 = -64 -64i, and (1-i)^13 = -64 +64i.\n\n11. Then, \u03a6_13(1+i) = [ (1+i)^13 -1 ] / (i ) = (-65 -64i)/i = -64 +65i.\n\n12. Similarly, \u03a6_13(1-i) = [ (1-i)^13 -1 ] / (-i ) = (-65 +64i)/(-i) = -64 -65i.\n\n13. Then, multiplied these two results: (-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i) = 8321.\n\n14. Finally, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the step where I compute \u03a6_13(1+i) and \u03a6_13(1-i). Let me double-check those calculations.\n\nFirst, \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 -1)/(x -1).\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1+i) = ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) / ( (1+i) - 1 ) = ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) / (i ).\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1-i) = ( (1-i)^13 -1 ) / ( (1-i) -1 ) = ( (1-i)^13 -1 ) / ( -i ).\n\nEarlier, I computed (1+i)^13 as -64 -64i. Let me verify that.\n\n(1+i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4. So, (1+i)^13 has magnitude (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64*sqrt(2). The angle is 13*(\u03c0/4) = 13\u03c0/4. Subtracting 2\u03c0 gives 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant. So, e^(i*5\u03c0/4) is (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2). So, (1+i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1) -64i = -64 -64i. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 is the conjugate, so -64 +64i. Correct.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1+i) = ( -64 -64i -1 ) / i = (-65 -64i)/i.\n\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by -i: (-65 -64i)(-i) / (i*(-i)) = (65i + 64i\u00b2) / 1 = 65i -64. So, that's -64 +65i. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1-i) = ( -64 +64i -1 ) / (-i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i). Multiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65 +64i)*i / (-i*i) = (-65i +64i\u00b2)/1 = -65i -64. Which is -64 -65i. Correct.\n\nSo, the product is (-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 + (65i)^2 + ... wait, no, as I did before, it's (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 because it's (a + b)(a - b). Wait, no, in this case, a is -64, b is 65i. So, (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nSo, (-64)^2 is 4096. (65i)^2 is -4225. So, 4096 - (-4225) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the product is 8321, which modulo 1000 is 321.\n\nHmm, but let me make sure that I didn't make any miscalculations in the complex number arithmetic. Let me recompute \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\n\u03a6_13(1+i) = [ (1+i)^13 -1 ] / (i ) = [ (-64 -64i) -1 ] / i = (-65 -64i)/i.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by -i: (-65 -64i)(-i) = 65i +64i\u00b2 = 65i -64. So, that's correct: -64 +65i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ] / (-i ) = [ (-64 +64i) -1 ] / (-i ) = (-65 +64i)/(-i ).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65 +64i)*i = -65i +64i\u00b2 = -65i -64. So, that's correct: -64 -65i.\n\nSo, multiplying (-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i) gives:\n\nFirst, (-64)*(-64) = 4096.\n\n(-64)*(-65i) = 4160i.\n\n(65i)*(-64) = -4160i.\n\n(65i)*(-65i) = -4225i\u00b2 = 4225.\n\nAdding these together: 4096 + 4160i -4160i +4225 = 4096 +4225 = 8321. Correct.\n\nSo, all steps seem correct. So, the product is 8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation x^13 = 1. These roots can be written as \u03c9^k for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 12, where \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/13). Since \u03c9 \u2260 1, we're excluding k=0, but in our product, k starts at 0, so when k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1. So, I need to evaluate the product when k=0 as well.\n\nWait, let me check what happens when k=0. The term becomes 2 - 2*(1) + (1)^2, which is 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So, the first term is 1. Then, the product from k=1 to 12 would be multiplied by this 1, so the overall product is just the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nHmm, so maybe I can simplify the expression (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) for each k. Let me see if I can factor this or write it in a different form.\n\nLet me consider the expression inside the product: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let's set x = \u03c9^k. Then, the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x\u00b2. Let me write that as x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation. Maybe I can factor it or find its roots. The quadratic is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Let me compute its discriminant: b\u00b2 - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4. So, the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, the quadratic factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Therefore, 2 - 2x + x\u00b2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, substituting back x = \u03c9^k, each term in the product becomes (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, the entire product is the product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). Since multiplication is commutative, I can separate the product into two separate products: [product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] multiplied by [product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nHmm, now I remember that for roots of unity, products over (x - \u03c9^k) can be related to cyclotomic polynomials. Specifically, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k=1 to n-1 is the cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6_n(x). But wait, in our case, n=13, so \u03a6_13(x) is the minimal polynomial for \u03c9, which is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nWait, actually, \u03a6_n(x) is the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for each primitive nth root of unity. Since 13 is prime, all roots except 1 are primitive, so \u03a6_13(x) = product from k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k). And \u03a6_13(x) is equal to x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nSo, if I have product from k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nWait, so that means product from k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6_13(x). Therefore, in our case, each of the two products is \u03a6_13 evaluated at (1 + i) and (1 - i), respectively.\n\nSo, the product we're looking for is \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nNow, let's compute \u03a6_13(x). Since 13 is prime, \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / (i).\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i).\n\nWait, let me compute both \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i is sqrt(2) * e^(i\u03c0/4). So, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^(i * 13\u03c0/4).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^(-i\u03c0/4), so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^(-i * 13\u03c0/4).\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, e^(i * 13\u03c0/4) can be simplified. Since 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^(i * 5\u03c0/4) = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^(-i * 13\u03c0/4) = e^(-i * 5\u03c0/4) = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute that: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (2)/2 ) = 64 * (-1) = -64. Similarly, the imaginary part is 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * (-i (2)/2 ) = 64 * (-i) = -64i.\n\nWait, hold on, let me recast that. Wait, (1 + i)^13 is 64*sqrt(2) multiplied by [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nSo, 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * ( (-2)/2 ) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * (-i (2)/2 ) = 64*(-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 would be the conjugate, so (-64 + 64i).\n\nWait, let me verify that: (1 - i)^13 is 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nSo, 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 ) = -64, and 64 * sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64i. So, yes, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nNow, let's compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / (i ) = [ (-64 -64i) - 1 ] / i = ( -65 -64i ) / i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ] / (-i ) = [ (-64 +64i ) -1 ] / (-i ) = ( -65 +64i ) / (-i ).\n\nSo, let's compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) first. Let's compute (-65 -64i)/i.\n\nDividing by i is the same as multiplying numerator and denominator by -i, since 1/i = -i. So,\n\n(-65 -64i)/i = (-65 -64i) * (-i) / (i * -i) = (-65 -64i)*(-i) / 1 = (65i + 64i\u00b2).\n\nSince i\u00b2 = -1, this becomes 65i + 64*(-1) = -64 + 65i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) is ( -65 +64i ) / (-i ). Let's compute that.\n\nAgain, 1/(-i) is equal to i, since 1/i = -i, so 1/(-i) = i.\n\nSo, ( -65 +64i ) / (-i ) = ( -65 +64i ) * i = (-65i + 64i\u00b2) = (-65i -64) because i\u00b2 = -1.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = -64 -65i.\n\nNow, our original product is \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) = (-64 +65i) * (-64 -65i).\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nAlternatively, it's ( (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 ) = 4096 - (4225 * (-1)) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nWait, let me compute that step by step.\n\n(-64 +65i) * (-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 + (65i)^2 - (64)(65i) + (65i)(64). Wait, no, that's not the right expansion.\n\nWait, actually, it's (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2. Here, a = -64, b = 65i. So, a\u00b2 is (-64)^2 = 4096. b\u00b2 is (65i)^2 = 4225 * i\u00b2 = -4225. So, a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 4096 - (-4225) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that multiplication:\n\n(-64 +65i) * (-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 + (-64)(-65i) + (65i)(-64) + (65i)(-65i).\n\nCompute term by term:\n\nFirst term: (-64)^2 = 4096.\n\nSecond term: (-64)*(-65i) = 4160i.\n\nThird term: 65i*(-64) = -4160i.\n\nFourth term: 65i*(-65i) = -4225i\u00b2 = -4225*(-1) = 4225.\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\n4096 + 4160i -4160i +4225 = 4096 + 0i +4225 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Now, the problem is to find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000. The remainder is the last three digits. Since 8321 = 8*1000 + 321, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. 1000 * 8 = 8000. 8321 - 8000 = 321. Yes, so the remainder is 321.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 321.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes earlier. Let me retrace my steps.\n\n1. I started by noting that \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity.\n\n2. The product is over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\n3. When k=0, the term is 1, so the product is 1 * product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\n4. Then, I rewrote each term as x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 where x = \u03c9^k.\n\n5. Factored it as (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)).\n\n6. Therefore, the product becomes product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1+i))(\u03c9^k - (1-i)).\n\n7. Since the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k=1 to 12 is \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 -1)/(x -1).\n\n8. So, each of the two products is \u03a6_13(1+i) and \u03a6_13(1-i).\n\n9. Then, I computed \u03a6_13(1+i) and \u03a6_13(1-i) by expressing (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13, which involved converting them to polar form and raising to the 13th power.\n\n10. Calculated (1+i)^13 = -64 -64i, and (1-i)^13 = -64 +64i.\n\n11. Then, \u03a6_13(1+i) = [ (1+i)^13 -1 ] / (i ) = (-65 -64i)/i = -64 +65i.\n\n12. Similarly, \u03a6_13(1-i) = [ (1-i)^13 -1 ] / (-i ) = (-65 +64i)/(-i) = -64 -65i.\n\n13. Then, multiplied these two results: (-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i) = 8321.\n\n14. Finally, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the step where I compute \u03a6_13(1+i) and \u03a6_13(1-i). Let me double-check those calculations.\n\nFirst, \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 -1)/(x -1).\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1+i) = ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) / ( (1+i) - 1 ) = ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) / (i ).\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1-i) = ( (1-i)^13 -1 ) / ( (1-i) -1 ) = ( (1-i)^13 -1 ) / ( -i ).\n\nEarlier, I computed (1+i)^13 as -64 -64i. Let me verify that.\n\n(1+i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4. So, (1+i)^13 has magnitude (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64*sqrt(2). The angle is 13*(\u03c0/4) = 13\u03c0/4. Subtracting 2\u03c0 gives 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant. So, e^(i*5\u03c0/4) is (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2). So, (1+i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1) -64i = -64 -64i. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 is the conjugate, so -64 +64i. Correct.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1+i) = ( -64 -64i -1 ) / i = (-65 -64i)/i.\n\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by -i: (-65 -64i)(-i) / (i*(-i)) = (65i + 64i\u00b2) / 1 = 65i -64. So, that's -64 +65i. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1-i) = ( -64 +64i -1 ) / (-i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i). Multiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65 +64i)*i / (-i*i) = (-65i +64i\u00b2)/1 = -65i -64. Which is -64 -65i. Correct.\n\nSo, the product is (-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 + (65i)^2 + ... wait, no, as I did before, it's (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 because it's (a + b)(a - b). Wait, no, in this case, a is -64, b is 65i. So, (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nSo, (-64)^2 is 4096. (65i)^2 is -4225. So, 4096 - (-4225) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the product is 8321, which modulo 1000 is 321.\n\nHmm, but let me make sure that I didn't make any miscalculations in the complex number arithmetic. Let me recompute \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\n\u03a6_13(1+i) = [ (1+i)^13 -1 ] / (i ) = [ (-64 -64i) -1 ] / i = (-65 -64i)/i.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by -i: (-65 -64i)(-i) = 65i +64i\u00b2 = 65i -64. So, that's correct: -64 +65i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ] / (-i ) = [ (-64 +64i) -1 ] / (-i ) = (-65 +64i)/(-i ).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65 +64i)*i = -65i +64i\u00b2 = -65i -64. So, that's correct: -64 -65i.\n\nSo, multiplying (-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i) gives:\n\nFirst, (-64)*(-64) = 4096.\n\n(-64)*(-65i) = 4160i.\n\n(65i)*(-64) = -4160i.\n\n(65i)*(-65i) = -4225i\u00b2 = 4225.\n\nAdding these together: 4096 + 4160i -4160i +4225 = 4096 +4225 = 8321. Correct.\n\nSo, all steps seem correct. So, the product is 8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity. The given product is:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\n\\]\n\nWhen \\(k = 0\\), the term simplifies to 1, so the product reduces to:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\n\\]\n\nWe rewrite each term as a quadratic in \\(x = \\omega^k\\):\n\n\\[\n2 - 2x + x^2 = x^2 - 2x + 2\n\\]\n\nFactoring this quadratic, we get:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i))\n\\]\n\nThus, each term becomes:\n\n\\[\n(\\omega^k - (1 + i))(\\omega^k - (1 - i))\n\\]\n\nThe entire product is:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=1}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 + i)) \\cdot \\prod_{k=1}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 - i))\n\\]\n\nUsing the cyclotomic polynomial \\(\\Phi_{13}(x) = \\prod_{k=1}^{12} (x - \\omega^k)\\), we recognize that:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{13}(1 + i) = \\prod_{k=1}^{12} (1 + i - \\omega^k) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Phi_{13}(1 - i) = \\prod_{k=1}^{12} (1 - i - \\omega^k)\n\\]\n\nWe compute \\(\\Phi_{13}(1 + i)\\) and \\(\\Phi_{13}(1 - i)\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some special properties. Since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k for k=0,1,...,12 are all distinct roots except for \u03c9^0=1. But the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, so we're considering the primitive 13th roots of unity.\n\nThe expression we're looking at is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me write that down:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\n\nI need to compute this product and then find its remainder modulo 1000. Hmm, that's the goal.\n\nLet me see if I can simplify the expression inside the product first. Let's denote each term as:\n\nA_k = 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}\n\nI wonder if A_k can be factored or expressed in a more manageable form. Maybe factor out something or rewrite it using exponents.\n\nLooking at A_k:\n\nA_k = 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}\n\nHmm, let's rearrange the terms:\n\nA_k = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2\n\nThat looks like a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me write it as:\n\nA_k = (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2\n\nYes, that's a quadratic equation in terms of \u03c9^k. Let me denote x = \u03c9^k, so:\n\nA_k = x^2 - 2x + 2\n\nNow, can I factor this quadratic? Let's try to find its roots. The discriminant is D = (\u22122)^2 \u2212 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are:\n\nx = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 2i] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i\n\nSo, the quadratic factors as (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)). Therefore,\n\nA_k = (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)) = (\u03c9^k - (1+i))(\u03c9^k - (1-i))\n\nSo, A_k is the product of (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) and (\u03c9^k - (1-i)). Therefore, the entire product becomes:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} [ (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) (\u03c9^k - (1-i)) ]\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nProduct = [ \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) ] * [ \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1-i)) ]\n\nSo, if I can compute each of these products separately and then multiply them together, that would give me the desired product.\n\nWait a second, I remember that for roots of unity, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to n-1 is equal to x^n - 1. Because the minimal polynomial for the roots of unity is cyclotomic, but in this case, since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) from k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1.\n\nSo, in general, for a primitive n-th root of unity \u03c9, \u220f_{k=0}^{n-1} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^n - 1.\n\nTherefore, in our case, n=13. So,\n\n\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1\n\nSo, substituting x with (1+i) and (1-i), we get:\n\n\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) = (1+i)^13 - 1\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1-i)) = (1-i)^13 - 1\n\nWait, wait, hold on. Let me think about this substitution. Because in the product formula, it's (x - \u03c9^k), but in our case, it's (\u03c9^k - (1+i)). So, I need to adjust for that.\n\nSo, let's write:\n\n\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) * (-1)^{13} because each term is (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)(a - \u03c9^k)\n\nSince 13 is odd, (-1)^13 = -1. Therefore,\n\n\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = - \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = -(a^13 - 1)\n\nSo, for a = 1+i, we have:\n\n\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) = -[(1+i)^13 - 1]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1-i)) = -[(1-i)^13 - 1]\n\nTherefore, the original product is:\n\nProduct = [ -((1+i)^13 - 1) ] * [ -((1-i)^13 - 1) ] = [ - (1+i)^13 + 1 ] * [ - (1-i)^13 + 1 ]\n\nWait, let's compute that. Let me write it as:\n\nProduct = [ (1 - (1+i)^13 ) ] * [ (1 - (1-i)^13 ) ]\n\nBecause when you distribute the negatives, it's (-A + B) * (-C + D) = (B - A)(D - C), but in this case, both terms are similar, so let me compute each part.\n\nSo, first, I need to compute (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13.\n\nCalculating (1+i)^n is a common problem. I remember that (1+i) can be represented in polar form. Let me recall:\n\n1 + i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4. So,\n\n1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}\n\nTherefore, (1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13\u03c0/4}\n\nSimilarly, (1-i) is sqrt(2) e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1-i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}\n\nLet me compute these exponents.\n\nFirst, (sqrt(2))^13.\n\nsqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2)\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{i *13\u03c0/4}\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents 13\u03c0/4 and -13\u03c0/4. Since angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, let me subtract multiples of 2\u03c0 to find the equivalent angle.\n\n13\u03c0/4 divided by 2\u03c0 is (13/4)/2 = 13/8 \u2248 1.625, so subtract 2\u03c0 once: 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, for -13\u03c0/4: adding 2\u03c0 twice: -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13 + 16)\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo,\n\n(1+i)^13 = 64\u221a2 e^{i5\u03c0/4} = 64\u221a2 [ cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) ]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(1-i)^13 = 64\u221a2 e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = 64\u221a2 [ cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) ]\n\nBecause e^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, cos(5\u03c0/4) is -\u221a2/2, and sin(5\u03c0/4) is -\u221a2/2. Let me compute that.\n\nCompute (1+i)^13:\n\n= 64\u221a2 [ cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) ]\n\n= 64\u221a2 [ (-\u221a2/2) + i (-\u221a2/2) ]\n\n= 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2)(1 + i)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\u221a2 * \u221a2 = 2, so:\n\n= 64 * (-2/2) (1 + i)\n\n= 64 * (-1) (1 + i)\n\n= -64 (1 + i)\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13:\n\n= 64\u221a2 [ cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) ]\n\n= 64\u221a2 [ (-\u221a2/2) - i (-\u221a2/2) ]\n\n= 64\u221a2 [ (-\u221a2/2) + i (\u221a2/2) ]\n\n= 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2)(1 - i)\n\nAgain, \u221a2 * \u221a2 = 2:\n\n= 64 * (-2/2) (1 - i)\n\n= 64 * (-1)(1 - i)\n\n= -64 (1 - i)\n\nSo, now, plugging back into the product:\n\nProduct = [1 - (1+i)^13 ] * [1 - (1-i)^13 ]\n\n= [1 - (-64)(1 + i) ] * [1 - (-64)(1 - i) ]\n\nSimplify each bracket:\n\nFirst bracket: 1 - (-64)(1+i) = 1 + 64(1 + i) = 1 + 64 + 64i = 65 + 64i\n\nSecond bracket: 1 - (-64)(1 - i) = 1 + 64(1 - i) = 1 + 64 - 64i = 65 - 64i\n\nSo, the product is:\n\n(65 + 64i)(65 - 64i)\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nSo, (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65^2 + (64)^2\n\nCompute 65^2: 65*65. Let's compute 60^2 + 2*60*5 + 5^2 = 3600 + 600 +25=4225.\n\n64^2: 64*64=4096.\n\nSo, sum is 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, 4225 + 4096: 4000 + 4000=8000, 225 + 96=321. So total is 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the computations:\n\n65^2 = 4225, correct.\n\n64^2 = 4096, correct.\n\n4225 + 4096: 4000 + 4000 = 8000, 225 + 96=321, so total is 8321. Correct.\n\nSo, the entire product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, let me recap because this seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I didn't skip any steps.\n\nWe started with Product = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\n\nExpressed each term as (\u03c9^k - (1+i))(\u03c9^k - (1-i)), then the product becomes [ \u220f (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) ] * [ \u220f (\u03c9^k - (1-i)) ]\n\nEach product was computed as -[(1+i)^13 - 1] and -[(1-i)^13 -1], then the product became [1 - (1+i)^13][1 - (1-i)^13]\n\nComputed (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13 using polar form, found they were -64(1+i) and -64(1-i), respectively.\n\nSubstituted back to get [1 +64(1+i)] and [1 +64(1-i)].\n\nComputed each bracket as 65 +64i and 65 -64i, multiplied them to get 65^2 +64^2=8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Now, the question is to find the remainder when this is divided by 1000.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000. The remainder is the last three digits, which is 321.\n\nWait, because 8000 is divisible by 1000, so 8321 - 8000 = 321. So, remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm.\n\nCompute 8321 mod 1000.\n\n8321 / 1000 = 8 * 1000 = 8000, 8321 - 8000 = 321.\n\nYes, so remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Let me double-check whether the product is indeed 8321.\n\nWait, in the step where I calculated (1+i)^13, I might have made a miscalculation. Let me recheck that.\n\nEarlier, I said (1+i) = sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}, so (1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13\u03c0/4}.\n\nWait, (sqrt(2))^13 is equal to (2)^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2), which is correct.\n\nThen, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4, which is correct. So, e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2.\n\nTherefore, (1+i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64 * (-2/2)(1 + i) = -64(1 +i). That's correct.\n\nSimilarly for (1-i)^13, same steps, but angle is -5\u03c0/4, which gives -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2, leading to -64(1 -i). Correct.\n\nSo, [1 - (1+i)^13] = 1 - (-64)(1+i) = 1 + 64(1 +i) = 65 +64i.\n\nSimilarly, [1 - (1-i)^13] = 1 +64(1 -i) = 65 -64i.\n\nMultiplying them gives (65)^2 + (64)^2, because (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 when dealing with real numbers, but wait, no, actually, wait.\n\nWait, no, (a + bi)(a - bi) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2. Yes, that's correct, because the cross terms cancel out.\n\nSo, (65 +64i)(65 -64i) = 65\u00b2 +64\u00b2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let's compute 8321 / 1000.\n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. Because 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321. So, yes, remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Did I account for the negative signs correctly in the product?\n\nEarlier, when I wrote:\n\nProduct = [ -((1+i)^13 - 1) ] * [ -((1-i)^13 -1) ]\n\n= [1 - (1+i)^13 ] * [1 - (1-i)^13 ]\n\nWhich is correct because:\n\n- (A - 1) = 1 - A.\n\nSo, yes, that step was correct.\n\nTherefore, all steps seem correct. So, the product is indeed 8321, and mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321 when divided by 1000.\n\nWait, but just to be extra cautious, perhaps I should check if 8321 is the correct product.\n\nLet me compute (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) again.\n\n65*65 = 4225.\n\n65*(-64i) = -4160i.\n\n64i*65 = 4160i.\n\n64i*(-64i) = -4096 i\u00b2 = -4096*(-1) = 4096.\n\nSo, adding all terms:\n\n4225 -4160i +4160i +4096.\n\nThe imaginary terms cancel out: (-4160i +4160i)=0.\n\nSo, 4225 +4096=8321. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 321.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some special properties. Since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k for k=0,1,...,12 are all distinct roots except for \u03c9^0=1. But the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, so we're considering the primitive 13th roots of unity.\n\nThe expression we're looking at is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me write that down:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\n\nI need to compute this product and then find its remainder modulo 1000. Hmm, that's the goal.\n\nLet me see if I can simplify the expression inside the product first. Let's denote each term as:\n\nA_k = 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}\n\nI wonder if A_k can be factored or expressed in a more manageable form. Maybe factor out something or rewrite it using exponents.\n\nLooking at A_k:\n\nA_k = 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}\n\nHmm, let's rearrange the terms:\n\nA_k = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2\n\nThat looks like a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me write it as:\n\nA_k = (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2\n\nYes, that's a quadratic equation in terms of \u03c9^k. Let me denote x = \u03c9^k, so:\n\nA_k = x^2 - 2x + 2\n\nNow, can I factor this quadratic? Let's try to find its roots. The discriminant is D = (\u22122)^2 \u2212 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are:\n\nx = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 2i] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i\n\nSo, the quadratic factors as (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)). Therefore,\n\nA_k = (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)) = (\u03c9^k - (1+i))(\u03c9^k - (1-i))\n\nSo, A_k is the product of (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) and (\u03c9^k - (1-i)). Therefore, the entire product becomes:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} [ (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) (\u03c9^k - (1-i)) ]\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nProduct = [ \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) ] * [ \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1-i)) ]\n\nSo, if I can compute each of these products separately and then multiply them together, that would give me the desired product.\n\nWait a second, I remember that for roots of unity, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to n-1 is equal to x^n - 1. Because the minimal polynomial for the roots of unity is cyclotomic, but in this case, since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) from k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1.\n\nSo, in general, for a primitive n-th root of unity \u03c9, \u220f_{k=0}^{n-1} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^n - 1.\n\nTherefore, in our case, n=13. So,\n\n\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1\n\nSo, substituting x with (1+i) and (1-i), we get:\n\n\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) = (1+i)^13 - 1\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1-i)) = (1-i)^13 - 1\n\nWait, wait, hold on. Let me think about this substitution. Because in the product formula, it's (x - \u03c9^k), but in our case, it's (\u03c9^k - (1+i)). So, I need to adjust for that.\n\nSo, let's write:\n\n\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) * (-1)^{13} because each term is (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)(a - \u03c9^k)\n\nSince 13 is odd, (-1)^13 = -1. Therefore,\n\n\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = - \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = -(a^13 - 1)\n\nSo, for a = 1+i, we have:\n\n\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) = -[(1+i)^13 - 1]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1-i)) = -[(1-i)^13 - 1]\n\nTherefore, the original product is:\n\nProduct = [ -((1+i)^13 - 1) ] * [ -((1-i)^13 - 1) ] = [ - (1+i)^13 + 1 ] * [ - (1-i)^13 + 1 ]\n\nWait, let's compute that. Let me write it as:\n\nProduct = [ (1 - (1+i)^13 ) ] * [ (1 - (1-i)^13 ) ]\n\nBecause when you distribute the negatives, it's (-A + B) * (-C + D) = (B - A)(D - C), but in this case, both terms are similar, so let me compute each part.\n\nSo, first, I need to compute (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13.\n\nCalculating (1+i)^n is a common problem. I remember that (1+i) can be represented in polar form. Let me recall:\n\n1 + i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4. So,\n\n1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}\n\nTherefore, (1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13\u03c0/4}\n\nSimilarly, (1-i) is sqrt(2) e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1-i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}\n\nLet me compute these exponents.\n\nFirst, (sqrt(2))^13.\n\nsqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2)\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{i *13\u03c0/4}\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents 13\u03c0/4 and -13\u03c0/4. Since angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, let me subtract multiples of 2\u03c0 to find the equivalent angle.\n\n13\u03c0/4 divided by 2\u03c0 is (13/4)/2 = 13/8 \u2248 1.625, so subtract 2\u03c0 once: 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, for -13\u03c0/4: adding 2\u03c0 twice: -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13 + 16)\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo,\n\n(1+i)^13 = 64\u221a2 e^{i5\u03c0/4} = 64\u221a2 [ cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) ]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(1-i)^13 = 64\u221a2 e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = 64\u221a2 [ cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) ]\n\nBecause e^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, cos(5\u03c0/4) is -\u221a2/2, and sin(5\u03c0/4) is -\u221a2/2. Let me compute that.\n\nCompute (1+i)^13:\n\n= 64\u221a2 [ cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) ]\n\n= 64\u221a2 [ (-\u221a2/2) + i (-\u221a2/2) ]\n\n= 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2)(1 + i)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\u221a2 * \u221a2 = 2, so:\n\n= 64 * (-2/2) (1 + i)\n\n= 64 * (-1) (1 + i)\n\n= -64 (1 + i)\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13:\n\n= 64\u221a2 [ cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) ]\n\n= 64\u221a2 [ (-\u221a2/2) - i (-\u221a2/2) ]\n\n= 64\u221a2 [ (-\u221a2/2) + i (\u221a2/2) ]\n\n= 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2)(1 - i)\n\nAgain, \u221a2 * \u221a2 = 2:\n\n= 64 * (-2/2) (1 - i)\n\n= 64 * (-1)(1 - i)\n\n= -64 (1 - i)\n\nSo, now, plugging back into the product:\n\nProduct = [1 - (1+i)^13 ] * [1 - (1-i)^13 ]\n\n= [1 - (-64)(1 + i) ] * [1 - (-64)(1 - i) ]\n\nSimplify each bracket:\n\nFirst bracket: 1 - (-64)(1+i) = 1 + 64(1 + i) = 1 + 64 + 64i = 65 + 64i\n\nSecond bracket: 1 - (-64)(1 - i) = 1 + 64(1 - i) = 1 + 64 - 64i = 65 - 64i\n\nSo, the product is:\n\n(65 + 64i)(65 - 64i)\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nSo, (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65^2 + (64)^2\n\nCompute 65^2: 65*65. Let's compute 60^2 + 2*60*5 + 5^2 = 3600 + 600 +25=4225.\n\n64^2: 64*64=4096.\n\nSo, sum is 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, 4225 + 4096: 4000 + 4000=8000, 225 + 96=321. So total is 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the computations:\n\n65^2 = 4225, correct.\n\n64^2 = 4096, correct.\n\n4225 + 4096: 4000 + 4000 = 8000, 225 + 96=321, so total is 8321. Correct.\n\nSo, the entire product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, let me recap because this seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I didn't skip any steps.\n\nWe started with Product = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\n\nExpressed each term as (\u03c9^k - (1+i))(\u03c9^k - (1-i)), then the product becomes [ \u220f (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) ] * [ \u220f (\u03c9^k - (1-i)) ]\n\nEach product was computed as -[(1+i)^13 - 1] and -[(1-i)^13 -1], then the product became [1 - (1+i)^13][1 - (1-i)^13]\n\nComputed (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13 using polar form, found they were -64(1+i) and -64(1-i), respectively.\n\nSubstituted back to get [1 +64(1+i)] and [1 +64(1-i)].\n\nComputed each bracket as 65 +64i and 65 -64i, multiplied them to get 65^2 +64^2=8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Now, the question is to find the remainder when this is divided by 1000.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000. The remainder is the last three digits, which is 321.\n\nWait, because 8000 is divisible by 1000, so 8321 - 8000 = 321. So, remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm.\n\nCompute 8321 mod 1000.\n\n8321 / 1000 = 8 * 1000 = 8000, 8321 - 8000 = 321.\n\nYes, so remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Let me double-check whether the product is indeed 8321.\n\nWait, in the step where I calculated (1+i)^13, I might have made a miscalculation. Let me recheck that.\n\nEarlier, I said (1+i) = sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}, so (1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13\u03c0/4}.\n\nWait, (sqrt(2))^13 is equal to (2)^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2), which is correct.\n\nThen, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4, which is correct. So, e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2.\n\nTherefore, (1+i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64 * (-2/2)(1 + i) = -64(1 +i). That's correct.\n\nSimilarly for (1-i)^13, same steps, but angle is -5\u03c0/4, which gives -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2, leading to -64(1 -i). Correct.\n\nSo, [1 - (1+i)^13] = 1 - (-64)(1+i) = 1 + 64(1 +i) = 65 +64i.\n\nSimilarly, [1 - (1-i)^13] = 1 +64(1 -i) = 65 -64i.\n\nMultiplying them gives (65)^2 + (64)^2, because (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 when dealing with real numbers, but wait, no, actually, wait.\n\nWait, no, (a + bi)(a - bi) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2. Yes, that's correct, because the cross terms cancel out.\n\nSo, (65 +64i)(65 -64i) = 65\u00b2 +64\u00b2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let's compute 8321 / 1000.\n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. Because 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321. So, yes, remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Did I account for the negative signs correctly in the product?\n\nEarlier, when I wrote:\n\nProduct = [ -((1+i)^13 - 1) ] * [ -((1-i)^13 -1) ]\n\n= [1 - (1+i)^13 ] * [1 - (1-i)^13 ]\n\nWhich is correct because:\n\n- (A - 1) = 1 - A.\n\nSo, yes, that step was correct.\n\nTherefore, all steps seem correct. So, the product is indeed 8321, and mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321 when divided by 1000.\n\nWait, but just to be extra cautious, perhaps I should check if 8321 is the correct product.\n\nLet me compute (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) again.\n\n65*65 = 4225.\n\n65*(-64i) = -4160i.\n\n64i*65 = 4160i.\n\n64i*(-64i) = -4096 i\u00b2 = -4096*(-1) = 4096.\n\nSo, adding all terms:\n\n4225 -4160i +4160i +4096.\n\nThe imaginary terms cancel out: (-4160i +4160i)=0.\n\nSo, 4225 +4096=8321. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 321.\n\n\nThe problem requires finding the remainder when the product \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) \\) is divided by 1000, where \\( \\omega \\) is a primitive 13th root of unity.\n\n1. **Simplify the expression inside the product:**\n   Each term \\( A_k = 2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k} \\) can be rewritten as \\( A_k = \\omega^{2k} - 2\\omega^k + 2 \\), which factors into \\( (\u03c9^k - (1+i))(\u03c9^k - (1-i)) \\).\n\n2. **Express the product as two separate products:**\n   \\[\n   \\prod_{k=0}^{12} A_k = \\left( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) \\right) \\left( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1-i)) \\right)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Use properties of roots of unity:**\n   For a primitive 13th root of unity \\( \u03c9 \\), \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^{13} - 1 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some special properties. Since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies \u03c9^13 = 1, and all the powers of \u03c9 from 0 to 12 are distinct. Also, the sum of all 13th roots of unity is zero, which might come in handy somewhere.\n\nThe expression I need to compute is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me write that out more clearly:\n\nP = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\n\nI need to find P mod 1000. So, maybe I can find a way to simplify this product first.\n\nLooking at the terms inside the product, each term is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me see if I can factor this or relate it to something else.\n\nWait, maybe I can rewrite the expression inside the product as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let's let x = \u03c9^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. So, 2 - 2x + x\u00b2. Hmm, is that a quadratic that can be factored?\n\nLet me compute the discriminant: b\u00b2 - 4ac = (\u22122)^2 \u2212 4*1*2 = 4 \u2212 8 = \u22124. So, it doesn't factor over the reals, but maybe over the complex numbers? Alternatively, perhaps it's related to cyclotomic polynomials or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write 2 - 2x + x\u00b2 as x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. That might not help directly, but perhaps there's a way to relate this to another polynomial.\n\nWait, let me think about cyclotomic polynomials. The 13th cyclotomic polynomial is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps I can consider the product as a product over all 13th roots of unity except \u03c9=1. Because when k=0, \u03c9^0=1, so the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the term when k=0 is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So the product is actually from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, k goes from 0 to 12, but since \u03c9^0 = 1, the term for k=0 is 1, so the product is the same as from k=1 to 12. So maybe I can focus on k=1 to 12.\n\nBut perhaps I should think of the entire product from k=0 to 12 as evaluating a certain polynomial at x=\u03c9^k. Wait, if I have a polynomial Q(x) = something, and I evaluate it at all the roots of another polynomial, the product might relate to the resultant or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each term is related to evaluating a polynomial at \u03c9^k. Let me see: Each term is 2 - 2x + x\u00b2, where x = \u03c9^k. So, if I have a polynomial Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, then each term is Q(x) evaluated at x=\u03c9^k. So, the product becomes \u220f_{k=0}^{12} Q(\u03c9^k).\n\nBut since \u03c9^k are all the 13th roots of unity, including 1, the product over all roots would be the product of Q(x) evaluated at each root. So, the product would be equal to the product of Q(x) over all x such that x^13 = 1.\n\nWait, but that product is equal to the resultant of Q(x) and x^13 - 1. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the product as the value of the polynomial at certain points.\n\nWait, another idea: the product over all x^13 = 1 of (a - x) is x^13 - a, right? Because the product of (x - root) for all roots is x^n - 1, so maybe something similar applies here.\n\nBut in this case, the terms are quadratic. So, maybe I can think of the product as the product over all 13th roots of unity of Q(x), where Q(x) is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nSo, the product P = \u220f_{x^13=1} (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2).\n\nBut how do I compute this product? Maybe I can relate it to another polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity.\n\nWait, since the 13th roots of unity are the roots of x^13 - 1 = 0, which factors as (x - 1)(x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1) = 0. So, the roots are 1 and the primitive 13th roots.\n\nBut I'm dealing with all 13th roots here, including 1.\n\nSo, the product P is \u220f_{x^13=1} (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). Hmm, that's the same as evaluating the resultant of the polynomials x^13 - 1 and x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that if I have a polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1, and another polynomial g(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, then the product P is equal to the product of g(x) evaluated at each root of f(x). So, P is the product over all roots \u03b1 of f(x) of g(\u03b1).\n\nBut there's a formula for this: the product of g(\u03b1) over all roots \u03b1 of f(x) is equal to the resultant of f and g, which is the product of g(\u03b1) for each root \u03b1 of f(x). Alternatively, it can be expressed as the product of (\u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2) for each \u03b1^13 = 1.\n\nBut computing this resultant might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product is equal to the product of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) over all x such that x^13 = 1. So, perhaps I can express this as evaluating another polynomial at x=1 or something.\n\nWait, another approach: the product over all x^13=1 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over all x^13=1 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). Let me consider that each x is a root of x^13 - 1, so maybe I can write this as the value of some resultant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use logarithms or exponents, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the product as evaluating the polynomial h(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 at each 13th root of unity and multiplying them all together.\n\nWait, another idea: the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1. So, perhaps I can relate the product of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) over all \u03c9^k to something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can note that for each \u03c9^k, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 can be written as (x - a)(x - b), where a and b are roots of x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0.\n\nSo, solving x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0, the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, the roots are 1 + i and 1 - i.\n\nSo, each term (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Therefore, the product P is the product over all x^13 = 1 of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, P = \u220f_{x^13=1} (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nBut the product over all x^13=1 of (x - a) is equal to a^13 - 1, because the product of (x - root) for all roots of x^13 - 1 is x^13 - 1. Wait, no, actually, the product over (a - root) for all roots of x^13 - 1 is a^13 - 1.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have a polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1, then the product of (x - root) for all roots is f(x). So, if I plug in x = a, then f(a) = a^13 - 1 = product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k).\n\nSo, the product over k=0 to 12 of (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1.\n\nSo, applying that here, since P is the product over all x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)), this would be equal to the product of ( (1 + i) - \u03c9^k ) for all k from 0 to 12 multiplied by the product of ( (1 - i) - \u03c9^k ) for all k from 0 to 12.\n\nSo, P = [ product_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 + i) - \u03c9^k ) ] * [ product_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 - i) - \u03c9^k ) ].\n\nBut from the earlier point, each product is equal to (1 + i)^13 - 1 and (1 - i)^13 - 1.\n\nWait, no: the product over (a - \u03c9^k) is a^13 - 1, right? Because the product over (x - \u03c9^k) from k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1. So, if I substitute x = a, then product (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1.\n\nSo, yes, the first product is (1 + i)^13 - 1, and the second is (1 - i)^13 - 1.\n\nTherefore, P = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nSo now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract 1 from each, multiply them, and then find the result modulo 1000.\n\nAlright, so let me compute (1 + i)^13 first. I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the angle is \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, (sqrt(2))^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNext, the angles: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0 to find the equivalent angle.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so subtract 2\u03c0: 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, for the negative angle: -13\u03c0/4 = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 (which is 2*2\u03c0) to make it positive: -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i5\u03c0/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * (cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * (cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4)).\n\nWait, actually, let me double-check that. Since 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant. So, cos(5\u03c0/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(5\u03c0/4) is -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 * (-1) = 64 * (2)/2 * (-1) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part is 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) i = -64 i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 would be the conjugate, so it would be -64 + 64i.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n(1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * (cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4)).\n\nWhich is 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (-sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64 * (-sqrt(2)/2) + 64 * (sqrt(2)/2) i.\n\nWhich is again -64 + 64i. So yes, correct.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i, and (1 - i)^13 = -64 +64i.\n\nNow, compute each product:\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSecond, (1 - i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, P = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nSo, | -65 -64i |\u00b2 = (-65)^2 + (-64)^2 = 65\u00b2 + 64\u00b2.\n\nCompute 65\u00b2: 65*65. 60\u00b2=3600, 5\u00b2=25, and cross term 2*60*5=600. So 65\u00b2=4225.\n\n64\u00b2: 64*64. 60\u00b2=3600, 4\u00b2=16, cross term 2*60*4=480. So 64\u00b2=4096.\n\nSo, 65\u00b2 + 64\u00b2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nTherefore, P = 8321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that calculation:\n\n65^2 = 4225, yes.\n\n64^2: 64 * 64. Let's compute 64*60=3840, 64*4=256. So 3840+256=4096. Yes.\n\nSum is 4225 + 4096. Let me compute 4225 + 4000=8225, plus 96=8321. Correct.\n\nSo, P = 8321.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, so we're excluding the term when k=0, right? Because when k=0, \u03c9^0=1, and the term is 2 -2*1 +1^2=2-2+1=1. So, the product is from k=0 to 12, but since the term at k=0 is 1, it doesn't affect the product. So, P = 8321.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the product from k=0 to12 is the same as from k=1 to12, but in reality, since the product from k=0 to12 includes k=0, which is 1, so P is indeed 8321.\n\nWait, but wait: the original expression is \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). But when k=0, \u03c9^0=1, so the term is 2 - 2*1 +1=1. So, the product is 1 * \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). So, in that case, the product would be equal to \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = 8321. So, P is 8321.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check: I computed P as the product over all 13th roots of unity, including 1, of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). But in the original problem, the product is from k=0 to12, which includes 1, so my earlier computation included that term, which is 1, so P is indeed 8321.\n\nSo, now I need to find 8321 mod 1000. That is, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000.\n\nCompute 8321 divided by 1000. 1000*8=8000, so 8321-8000=321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but wait a second: let me confirm that.\n\nYes, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, 8321 \u2261 321 mod 1000.\n\nBut wait, hold on: I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Because in the problem statement, \u03c9 \u22601 is a 13th root of unity, so when k=0, \u03c9^0=1, but the problem says \u03c9\u22601, so perhaps the product is from k=1 to12, not including k=0. Wait, no, the problem says \"Let \u03c9 \u22601 be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when \u220f_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000.\"\n\nSo, the product includes k=0, which gives 2 - 2*1 +1^2=1, so it's included. So, my initial calculation of 8321 is correct, and mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me think again: I computed the product as (1 + i)^13 -1 times (1 - i)^13 -1, which equals 8321. But perhaps I made a mistake in that computation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, (1 + i)^13: I had 1 + i in polar form as sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}. So, raising to the 13th power gives (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13\u03c0/4}.\n\nWhich is (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). Then, e^{i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1), since e^{i3\u03c0}=e^{i\u03c0}= -1.\n\nWait, no: e^{i3\u03c0} is e^{i\u03c0} which is -1, but 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is more than 2\u03c0. So, subtract 2\u03c0: 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 =5\u03c0/4, which is correct. So, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64 * (-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i) = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = 64 sqrt(2) [ cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) ] = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (-sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) )= 64 * (-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i) = -64 +64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product P = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 + (64)^2, because (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, but here, the signs: wait, no, because it's (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. So, yes, correct.\n\nSo, P is 8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321. So, the remainder is 321 when divided by 1000.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's recompute 65^2 and 64^2:\n\n65^2: 60^2 = 3600, 5^2=25, 2*60*5=600, so 3600 + 600 +25 = 4225.\n\n64^2: 60^2=3600, 4^2=16, 2*60*4=480, so 3600 + 480 +16= 4096.\n\n4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\n8321 divided by 1000: 1000*8=8000, 8321-8000=321.\n\nSo, yes, 321 is the remainder.\n\nSo, the answer is 321.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some special properties. Since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies \u03c9^13 = 1, and all the powers of \u03c9 from 0 to 12 are distinct. Also, the sum of all 13th roots of unity is zero, which might come in handy somewhere.\n\nThe expression I need to compute is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me write that out more clearly:\n\nP = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\n\nI need to find P mod 1000. So, maybe I can find a way to simplify this product first.\n\nLooking at the terms inside the product, each term is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me see if I can factor this or relate it to something else.\n\nWait, maybe I can rewrite the expression inside the product as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let's let x = \u03c9^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. So, 2 - 2x + x\u00b2. Hmm, is that a quadratic that can be factored?\n\nLet me compute the discriminant: b\u00b2 - 4ac = (\u22122)^2 \u2212 4*1*2 = 4 \u2212 8 = \u22124. So, it doesn't factor over the reals, but maybe over the complex numbers? Alternatively, perhaps it's related to cyclotomic polynomials or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write 2 - 2x + x\u00b2 as x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. That might not help directly, but perhaps there's a way to relate this to another polynomial.\n\nWait, let me think about cyclotomic polynomials. The 13th cyclotomic polynomial is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps I can consider the product as a product over all 13th roots of unity except \u03c9=1. Because when k=0, \u03c9^0=1, so the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the term when k=0 is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So the product is actually from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, k goes from 0 to 12, but since \u03c9^0 = 1, the term for k=0 is 1, so the product is the same as from k=1 to 12. So maybe I can focus on k=1 to 12.\n\nBut perhaps I should think of the entire product from k=0 to 12 as evaluating a certain polynomial at x=\u03c9^k. Wait, if I have a polynomial Q(x) = something, and I evaluate it at all the roots of another polynomial, the product might relate to the resultant or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each term is related to evaluating a polynomial at \u03c9^k. Let me see: Each term is 2 - 2x + x\u00b2, where x = \u03c9^k. So, if I have a polynomial Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, then each term is Q(x) evaluated at x=\u03c9^k. So, the product becomes \u220f_{k=0}^{12} Q(\u03c9^k).\n\nBut since \u03c9^k are all the 13th roots of unity, including 1, the product over all roots would be the product of Q(x) evaluated at each root. So, the product would be equal to the product of Q(x) over all x such that x^13 = 1.\n\nWait, but that product is equal to the resultant of Q(x) and x^13 - 1. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the product as the value of the polynomial at certain points.\n\nWait, another idea: the product over all x^13 = 1 of (a - x) is x^13 - a, right? Because the product of (x - root) for all roots is x^n - 1, so maybe something similar applies here.\n\nBut in this case, the terms are quadratic. So, maybe I can think of the product as the product over all 13th roots of unity of Q(x), where Q(x) is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nSo, the product P = \u220f_{x^13=1} (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2).\n\nBut how do I compute this product? Maybe I can relate it to another polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity.\n\nWait, since the 13th roots of unity are the roots of x^13 - 1 = 0, which factors as (x - 1)(x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1) = 0. So, the roots are 1 and the primitive 13th roots.\n\nBut I'm dealing with all 13th roots here, including 1.\n\nSo, the product P is \u220f_{x^13=1} (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). Hmm, that's the same as evaluating the resultant of the polynomials x^13 - 1 and x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that if I have a polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1, and another polynomial g(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, then the product P is equal to the product of g(x) evaluated at each root of f(x). So, P is the product over all roots \u03b1 of f(x) of g(\u03b1).\n\nBut there's a formula for this: the product of g(\u03b1) over all roots \u03b1 of f(x) is equal to the resultant of f and g, which is the product of g(\u03b1) for each root \u03b1 of f(x). Alternatively, it can be expressed as the product of (\u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2) for each \u03b1^13 = 1.\n\nBut computing this resultant might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product is equal to the product of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) over all x such that x^13 = 1. So, perhaps I can express this as evaluating another polynomial at x=1 or something.\n\nWait, another approach: the product over all x^13=1 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over all x^13=1 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). Let me consider that each x is a root of x^13 - 1, so maybe I can write this as the value of some resultant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use logarithms or exponents, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the product as evaluating the polynomial h(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 at each 13th root of unity and multiplying them all together.\n\nWait, another idea: the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1. So, perhaps I can relate the product of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) over all \u03c9^k to something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can note that for each \u03c9^k, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 can be written as (x - a)(x - b), where a and b are roots of x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0.\n\nSo, solving x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0, the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, the roots are 1 + i and 1 - i.\n\nSo, each term (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Therefore, the product P is the product over all x^13 = 1 of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, P = \u220f_{x^13=1} (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nBut the product over all x^13=1 of (x - a) is equal to a^13 - 1, because the product of (x - root) for all roots of x^13 - 1 is x^13 - 1. Wait, no, actually, the product over (a - root) for all roots of x^13 - 1 is a^13 - 1.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have a polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1, then the product of (x - root) for all roots is f(x). So, if I plug in x = a, then f(a) = a^13 - 1 = product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k).\n\nSo, the product over k=0 to 12 of (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1.\n\nSo, applying that here, since P is the product over all x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)), this would be equal to the product of ( (1 + i) - \u03c9^k ) for all k from 0 to 12 multiplied by the product of ( (1 - i) - \u03c9^k ) for all k from 0 to 12.\n\nSo, P = [ product_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 + i) - \u03c9^k ) ] * [ product_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 - i) - \u03c9^k ) ].\n\nBut from the earlier point, each product is equal to (1 + i)^13 - 1 and (1 - i)^13 - 1.\n\nWait, no: the product over (a - \u03c9^k) is a^13 - 1, right? Because the product over (x - \u03c9^k) from k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1. So, if I substitute x = a, then product (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1.\n\nSo, yes, the first product is (1 + i)^13 - 1, and the second is (1 - i)^13 - 1.\n\nTherefore, P = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nSo now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract 1 from each, multiply them, and then find the result modulo 1000.\n\nAlright, so let me compute (1 + i)^13 first. I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the angle is \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, (sqrt(2))^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNext, the angles: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0 to find the equivalent angle.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so subtract 2\u03c0: 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, for the negative angle: -13\u03c0/4 = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 (which is 2*2\u03c0) to make it positive: -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i5\u03c0/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * (cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * (cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4)).\n\nWait, actually, let me double-check that. Since 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant. So, cos(5\u03c0/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(5\u03c0/4) is -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 * (-1) = 64 * (2)/2 * (-1) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part is 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) i = -64 i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 would be the conjugate, so it would be -64 + 64i.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n(1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * (cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4)).\n\nWhich is 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (-sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64 * (-sqrt(2)/2) + 64 * (sqrt(2)/2) i.\n\nWhich is again -64 + 64i. So yes, correct.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i, and (1 - i)^13 = -64 +64i.\n\nNow, compute each product:\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSecond, (1 - i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, P = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nSo, | -65 -64i |\u00b2 = (-65)^2 + (-64)^2 = 65\u00b2 + 64\u00b2.\n\nCompute 65\u00b2: 65*65. 60\u00b2=3600, 5\u00b2=25, and cross term 2*60*5=600. So 65\u00b2=4225.\n\n64\u00b2: 64*64. 60\u00b2=3600, 4\u00b2=16, cross term 2*60*4=480. So 64\u00b2=4096.\n\nSo, 65\u00b2 + 64\u00b2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nTherefore, P = 8321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that calculation:\n\n65^2 = 4225, yes.\n\n64^2: 64 * 64. Let's compute 64*60=3840, 64*4=256. So 3840+256=4096. Yes.\n\nSum is 4225 + 4096. Let me compute 4225 + 4000=8225, plus 96=8321. Correct.\n\nSo, P = 8321.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, so we're excluding the term when k=0, right? Because when k=0, \u03c9^0=1, and the term is 2 -2*1 +1^2=2-2+1=1. So, the product is from k=0 to 12, but since the term at k=0 is 1, it doesn't affect the product. So, P = 8321.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the product from k=0 to12 is the same as from k=1 to12, but in reality, since the product from k=0 to12 includes k=0, which is 1, so P is indeed 8321.\n\nWait, but wait: the original expression is \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). But when k=0, \u03c9^0=1, so the term is 2 - 2*1 +1=1. So, the product is 1 * \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). So, in that case, the product would be equal to \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = 8321. So, P is 8321.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check: I computed P as the product over all 13th roots of unity, including 1, of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). But in the original problem, the product is from k=0 to12, which includes 1, so my earlier computation included that term, which is 1, so P is indeed 8321.\n\nSo, now I need to find 8321 mod 1000. That is, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000.\n\nCompute 8321 divided by 1000. 1000*8=8000, so 8321-8000=321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but wait a second: let me confirm that.\n\nYes, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, 8321 \u2261 321 mod 1000.\n\nBut wait, hold on: I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Because in the problem statement, \u03c9 \u22601 is a 13th root of unity, so when k=0, \u03c9^0=1, but the problem says \u03c9\u22601, so perhaps the product is from k=1 to12, not including k=0. Wait, no, the problem says \"Let \u03c9 \u22601 be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when \u220f_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000.\"\n\nSo, the product includes k=0, which gives 2 - 2*1 +1^2=1, so it's included. So, my initial calculation of 8321 is correct, and mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me think again: I computed the product as (1 + i)^13 -1 times (1 - i)^13 -1, which equals 8321. But perhaps I made a mistake in that computation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, (1 + i)^13: I had 1 + i in polar form as sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}. So, raising to the 13th power gives (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13\u03c0/4}.\n\nWhich is (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). Then, e^{i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1), since e^{i3\u03c0}=e^{i\u03c0}= -1.\n\nWait, no: e^{i3\u03c0} is e^{i\u03c0} which is -1, but 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is more than 2\u03c0. So, subtract 2\u03c0: 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 =5\u03c0/4, which is correct. So, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64 * (-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i) = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = 64 sqrt(2) [ cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) ] = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (-sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) )= 64 * (-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i) = -64 +64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product P = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 + (64)^2, because (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, but here, the signs: wait, no, because it's (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. So, yes, correct.\n\nSo, P is 8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321. So, the remainder is 321 when divided by 1000.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's recompute 65^2 and 64^2:\n\n65^2: 60^2 = 3600, 5^2=25, 2*60*5=600, so 3600 + 600 +25 = 4225.\n\n64^2: 60^2=3600, 4^2=16, 2*60*4=480, so 3600 + 480 +16= 4096.\n\n4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\n8321 divided by 1000: 1000*8=8000, 8321-8000=321.\n\nSo, yes, 321 is the remainder.\n\nSo, the answer is 321.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, satisfying \u03c9\u00b9\u00b3 = 1. The given product is:\n\n\\[ P = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) \\]\n\nWe rewrite each term as a quadratic in \u03c9\u1d4f: \\( 2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k} \\). Letting \\( x = \\omega^k \\), each term becomes \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\), which factors as \\( (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)) \\).\n\nThus, the product \\( P \\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ P = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 + i - \\omega^k) \\cdot \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - i - \\omega^k) \\]\n\nUsing the property that the product of \\( (a - \\omega^k) \\) over all 13th roots of unity is \\( a^{13} - 1 \\), we compute:\n\n\\[ \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 + i - \\omega^k) = (1 + i)^{13} - 1 \\]\n\\[ \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - i - \\omega^k) = (1 - i)^{13} - 1 \\]\n\nCalculating \\( (1 + i)^{13} \\) and \\( (1 - i)^{13} \\) in polar form:\n\n- \\( 1 + i = \\sqrt{2}e^{i\\pi/4} \\), so \\( (1 + i)^{13} = (2^{1/2})^{13}e^{i13\\pi/4} = 64\\sqrt{2}e^{i5\\pi/4} = -64 - 64i \\).\n- Similarly, \\( (1 - i)^{13} = -64 + 64i \\).\n\nThus:\n\n\\[ (1 + i)^{13} - 1 = -65 - 64i \\]\n\\[ (1 - i)^{13} - 1 = -65 + 64i \\]\n\nThe product is:\n\n\\[ (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321 \\]\n\nFinally, finding the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000:\n\n\\[ 8321 \\mod 1000 = 321 \\]\n\nThe remainder is:\n\n\\boxed{321}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the remainder when a certain product is divided by 1000. The product is given by \u220f from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), where \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and \u03c9 \u2260 1. Hmm, 13th roots of unity... I remember those are complex numbers that satisfy \u03c9^13 = 1, right? And since \u03c9 \u2260 1, we're dealing with the primitive roots.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. The product involves terms like (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) for each k from 0 to 12. That seems like a lot of terms to multiply together. I wonder if there's a pattern or a way to simplify each term first.\n\nFirst, let me consider a single term: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or express it in a different form. Let me try to rewrite it:\n\n2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2.\n\nWait, that looks like a quadratic in terms of \u03c9^k. Maybe I can treat \u03c9^k as a variable, say x, so the expression becomes x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Then, the term is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, where x = \u03c9^k.\n\nSo, each term in the product is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, and x is a 13th root of unity. Since \u03c9^13 = 1, each x is a root of x^13 = 1, except x \u2260 1.\n\nBut wait, the product is over all k from 0 to 12, which means x takes all the 13th roots of unity, including x=1 when k=0. So, actually, when k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1, so the term becomes 1\u00b2 - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So, that term is just 1. So, the product will be 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nHmm, so maybe I can ignore the k=0 term since it's 1, and focus on the product from k=1 to 12. That might make things a bit simpler.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about how to compute such a product. Since each term is a quadratic in \u03c9^k, perhaps there's a way to relate this to a polynomial whose roots are \u03c9^k. Remember, cyclotomic polynomials come into play with roots of unity.\n\nWait, the 13th cyclotomic polynomial is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1, since 13 is prime. But I'm not sure if that directly helps here. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the product over all roots of a certain polynomial.\n\nSince each term is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, and x is a root of x^13 - 1 = 0, perhaps I can find a relationship between these terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the product as the product over k=1 to 12 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2), where x = \u03c9^k. So, that's equivalent to evaluating the product over all non-1 13th roots of unity of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2).\n\nHmm, another approach: the product over all roots of a polynomial f(x) is equal to the constant term of f(x), up to a sign, depending on the degree. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.\n\nWait, another thought: If I have a polynomial P(x) whose roots are the 13th roots of unity, which is x^13 - 1. Then, the product over all roots (except x=1) of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) for each root x \u2260 1 of x^13 - 1.\n\nBut how can I compute that? I remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product over its roots of (x - a) is f(a). But here, it's a product of quadratic terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider evaluating the product as the resultant of two polynomials or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the product as the product of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) for each x being a root of x^13 - 1. So, if I let Q(x) = x^13 - 1, then the product I'm looking for is the product of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at each root x of Q(x). I think there's a formula for such a product.\n\nYes! I remember that if Q(x) is a polynomial with roots \u03b1\u2081, \u03b1\u2082, ..., \u03b1_n, then the product of (a - \u03b1_i) for i=1 to n is Q(a). So, in this case, if I have the product over all roots \u03b1 of Q(x) of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at \u03b1, which is the product over \u03b1 | Q(\u03b1)=0 of (\u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2). Hmm, but that's the same as evaluating the resultant or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that product as the resultant of Q(x) and the quadratic polynomial x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Or perhaps, more directly, consider the product over all roots \u03b1 of Q(x) of (\u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2). \n\nWait, another approach: Since each \u03b1 is a root of x^13 - 1 = 0, we can write \u03b1^13 = 1. So, for each \u03b1, \u03b1^13 = 1. Maybe I can express \u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2 in terms of \u03b1^13.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that would help. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the product as the product over \u03b1 of (\u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2) = product over \u03b1 of (\u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2).\n\nWait, let me think about polynomials. Let\u2019s consider f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Then, the product over all roots \u03b1 of Q(x) (where Q(x) = x^13 - 1) of f(\u03b1) is equal to the resultant of Q(x) and f(x). The resultant can be computed as the product of f(\u03b1_i) for each root \u03b1_i of Q(x). So, the resultant Res(Q, f) = product_{\u03b1_i} f(\u03b1_i).\n\nBut how do I compute that? I think the resultant can also be expressed as the determinant of the Sylvester matrix, but that might be complicated here. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate it to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of Q(x) and f(x). If Q(x) and f(x) are coprime, then the resultant is non-zero, but I don't think that directly helps.\n\nWait, another idea: Since Q(x) = x^13 - 1, and f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Let's compute the product over \u03b1 of f(\u03b1) = product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2). Since \u03b1^13 = 1, maybe we can find a way to express \u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2 in terms that can be simplified using \u03b1^13 = 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider f(\u03b1) = \u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2 and relate it to \u03b1^13.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor f(\u03b1) as (\u03b1 - a)(\u03b1 - b), but let me see if f(x) factors. Let's find the roots of f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, f(x) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, f(x) factors into (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Therefore, the product over \u03b1 of f(\u03b1) is equal to the product over \u03b1 of (\u03b1 - (1 + i))(\u03b1 - (1 - i)).\n\nBut that product is equal to the product over \u03b1 of (\u03b1 - (1 + i)) multiplied by the product over \u03b1 of (\u03b1 - (1 - i)). So, each of these products is the product of (\u03b1 - c) for each root \u03b1 of Q(x) = x^13 - 1.\n\nWait, but the product over \u03b1 of (\u03b1 - c) is equal to Q(c), right? Because Q(x) = product_{\u03b1} (x - \u03b1), so evaluating at x = c gives Q(c) = product_{\u03b1} (c - \u03b1) = (-1)^13 product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - c) = - product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - c). Therefore, product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - c) = - Q(c).\n\nSo, product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - c) = - (c^13 - 1). So, in our case, for c = 1 + i and c = 1 - i, we have:\n\nproduct_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - (1 + i)) = - ((1 + i)^13 - 1)\n\nproduct_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - (1 - i)) = - ((1 - i)^13 - 1)\n\nTherefore, the total product is [ - ((1 + i)^13 - 1) ] * [ - ((1 - i)^13 - 1) ].\n\nSimplifying, that's [ -1 * ((1 + i)^13 - 1) ] * [ -1 * ((1 - i)^13 - 1) ] = (-1)^2 * [ ((1 + i)^13 - 1) * ((1 - i)^13 - 1) ] = 1 * [ ((1 + i)^13 - 1) * ((1 - i)^13 - 1) ].\n\nSo, the product we're looking for is [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nNow, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^n. I remember that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is \u03c0/4 radians since it's in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNext, the exponents e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4} and e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute 13\u03c0/4. 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, which is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, let me subtract 2\u03c0 until it's within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) - i\u221a2/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) + i\u221a2/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64\u221a2 * [ (-\u221a2/2) - i\u221a2/2 ] = 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2)(1 + i).\n\nLet me compute that: 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * ( (\u221a2)(-\u221a2) ) / 2 = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64\u221a2 * [ (-\u221a2/2) + i\u221a2/2 ] = 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2)(1 - i).\n\nCompute that: 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2) = same as above, which is -64.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), and (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 - i) - 1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nNow, the product is [ -65 -64i ] * [ -65 +64i ].\n\nThat's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nCompute the modulus squared: (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n65 squared: 60^2 = 3600, 5^2=25, 2*60*5=600, so 3600 + 600 +25=4225.\n\n64 squared: 60^2=3600, 4^2=16, 2*60*4=480, so 3600+480+16=4096.\n\nAdding 4225 + 4096: 4225 + 4000=8225, plus 96=8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the product was [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1 -i)^13 -1 ] = 8321. But that's the product over all roots \u03b1 of Q(x) of f(\u03b1). However, in the original problem, the product is over k=1 to 12, which are the roots \u03b1 \u22601.\n\nWait, but when I computed product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - c) = - (c^13 -1 ), that includes all roots, including \u03b1=1. So, perhaps I need to adjust for that. Because in our case, when we take the product over \u03b1 of f(\u03b1), which is product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2), this includes \u03b1=1, but in the original problem, the product starts at k=0, which is \u03b1=1, but we saw that term is 1, so it doesn't contribute.\n\nWait, no, actually, when I computed the product over all \u03b1 of f(\u03b1), which is product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2), which includes \u03b1=1, but in the original problem, the product is from k=0 to 12, which is all \u03b1, including \u03b1=1. But earlier, I realized that when k=0, the term is 1, so the product is 1 * product_{k=1 to 12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nWait, but in my approach, I took the product over all roots \u03b1 of Q(x) (including \u03b1=1) of f(\u03b1), which is product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2). But that product is 8321, as computed above. However, in the original problem, the product is over all k=0 to 12, which is the same as over all roots \u03b1, including \u03b1=1. So, that product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the term when k=0 is 1, but let me check:\n\nAt k=0, \u03c9^0=1, so the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 +1=1. So, the product from k=0 to 12 is 1 * product_{k=1 to 12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = product_{\u03b1} (2 - 2\u03b1 + \u03b1\u00b2) where \u03b1 runs over all 13th roots of unity, including 1. So, that product is 8321.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that product over all \u03b1 of f(\u03b1) is 8321, which is correct. So, the original product is 8321. But wait, that can't be right because 8321 is a 4-digit number, and the problem asks for the remainder modulo 1000. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nFirst, let's verify the step where I said that product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - c) = - (c^13 -1 ). Because Q(x) = x^13 -1, so product_{\u03b1} (x - \u03b1) = x^13 -1. So, evaluating at x = c, we get product_{\u03b1} (c - \u03b1) = c^13 -1. But in our case, we have product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - c) = (-1)^{13} product_{\u03b1} (c - \u03b1) = (-1)^{13} (c^13 -1) = - (c^13 -1).\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nThen, product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - (1+i)) = - [ (1+i)^13 -1 ].\n\nSimilarly for (1 -i).\n\nSo, product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - (1+i)) * product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - (1-i)) = [ - ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ] = ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ).\n\nWait, no, because both are negative, so (-a)*(-b)=ab. So, correct.\n\nThen, I computed (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13.\n\nExpressed in polar form:\n\n1 + i = sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}, so (1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i = sqrt(2) e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 -i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i13\u03c0/4}.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) = 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nMultiply 64 sqrt(2) by -sqrt(2)/2: 64 * (sqrt(2) * -sqrt(2))/2 = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2 ) = -64 i.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 -i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ] = -64 +64i.\n\nTherefore, (1+i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nAnd (1 -i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nNow, multiply these two complex numbers: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).\n\nThis is of the form (a - b)(a + b) where a = -65 and b = -64i. So, it's a^2 - b^2.\n\nCompute a^2: (-65)^2 = 4225.\n\nCompute b^2: (-64i)^2 = (-64)^2 * i^2 = 4096 * (-1) = -4096.\n\nSo, a^2 - b^2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is indeed 8321.\n\nTherefore, the original product is 8321, and the remainder when divided by 1000 is 8321 mod 1000.\n\nCompute 8321 divided by 1000: 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the product over all \u03b1 of f(\u03b1) is indeed equal to the product we're asked to compute. Because in the original problem, the product is from k=0 to 12, which includes all 13th roots of unity, including \u03b1=1, which gives a term of 1. So, the product is 8321, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything important.\n\n1. Recognize that the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including 1, but the term at 1 is 1, so it doesn't change the product.\n\n2. Express each term as a quadratic in \u03c9^k, which is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, where x is a 13th root of unity.\n\n3. Realize that the product over all x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over all roots \u03b1 of x^13 -1 of (\u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2).\n\n4. Factor this product into two products involving (\u03b1 - (1+i)) and (\u03b1 - (1-i)).\n\n5. Use the fact that the product over all \u03b1 of (\u03b1 - c) is equal to - (c^13 -1) because Q(c) = c^13 -1.\n\n6. Compute (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13, subtract 1, and multiply the results.\n\n7. Find that the product is 8321, which modulo 1000 is 321.\n\nI think that all makes sense. So, the answer should be 321.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that the product involves terms of the form \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\) for each \\(k\\) from 0 to 12, where \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive 13th root of unity. \n\nFirst, we rewrite each term as a quadratic in \\(\\omega^k\\):\n\\[\n2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k} = \\omega^{2k} - 2\\omega^k + 2.\n\\]\nThis can be expressed as \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\) where \\(x = \\omega^k\\). \n\nThe product we need to compute is:\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2),\n\\]\nwhere \\(x\\) runs over all 13th roots of unity, including \\(x = 1\\). \n\nWe recognize that \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\) can be factored as \\((x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i))\\), where \\(1 \\pm i\\) are the roots of the quadratic.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the remainder when a certain product is divided by 1000. The product is given by \u220f from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), where \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and \u03c9 \u2260 1. Hmm, 13th roots of unity... I remember those are complex numbers that satisfy \u03c9^13 = 1, right? And since \u03c9 \u2260 1, we're dealing with the primitive roots.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. The product involves terms like (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) for each k from 0 to 12. That seems like a lot of terms to multiply together. I wonder if there's a pattern or a way to simplify each term first.\n\nFirst, let me consider a single term: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or express it in a different form. Let me try to rewrite it:\n\n2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2.\n\nWait, that looks like a quadratic in terms of \u03c9^k. Maybe I can treat \u03c9^k as a variable, say x, so the expression becomes x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Then, the term is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, where x = \u03c9^k.\n\nSo, each term in the product is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, and x is a 13th root of unity. Since \u03c9^13 = 1, each x is a root of x^13 = 1, except x \u2260 1.\n\nBut wait, the product is over all k from 0 to 12, which means x takes all the 13th roots of unity, including x=1 when k=0. So, actually, when k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1, so the term becomes 1\u00b2 - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So, that term is just 1. So, the product will be 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nHmm, so maybe I can ignore the k=0 term since it's 1, and focus on the product from k=1 to 12. That might make things a bit simpler.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about how to compute such a product. Since each term is a quadratic in \u03c9^k, perhaps there's a way to relate this to a polynomial whose roots are \u03c9^k. Remember, cyclotomic polynomials come into play with roots of unity.\n\nWait, the 13th cyclotomic polynomial is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1, since 13 is prime. But I'm not sure if that directly helps here. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the product over all roots of a certain polynomial.\n\nSince each term is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, and x is a root of x^13 - 1 = 0, perhaps I can find a relationship between these terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the product as the product over k=1 to 12 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2), where x = \u03c9^k. So, that's equivalent to evaluating the product over all non-1 13th roots of unity of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2).\n\nHmm, another approach: the product over all roots of a polynomial f(x) is equal to the constant term of f(x), up to a sign, depending on the degree. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.\n\nWait, another thought: If I have a polynomial P(x) whose roots are the 13th roots of unity, which is x^13 - 1. Then, the product over all roots (except x=1) of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) for each root x \u2260 1 of x^13 - 1.\n\nBut how can I compute that? I remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product over its roots of (x - a) is f(a). But here, it's a product of quadratic terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider evaluating the product as the resultant of two polynomials or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the product as the product of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) for each x being a root of x^13 - 1. So, if I let Q(x) = x^13 - 1, then the product I'm looking for is the product of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at each root x of Q(x). I think there's a formula for such a product.\n\nYes! I remember that if Q(x) is a polynomial with roots \u03b1\u2081, \u03b1\u2082, ..., \u03b1_n, then the product of (a - \u03b1_i) for i=1 to n is Q(a). So, in this case, if I have the product over all roots \u03b1 of Q(x) of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at \u03b1, which is the product over \u03b1 | Q(\u03b1)=0 of (\u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2). Hmm, but that's the same as evaluating the resultant or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that product as the resultant of Q(x) and the quadratic polynomial x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Or perhaps, more directly, consider the product over all roots \u03b1 of Q(x) of (\u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2). \n\nWait, another approach: Since each \u03b1 is a root of x^13 - 1 = 0, we can write \u03b1^13 = 1. So, for each \u03b1, \u03b1^13 = 1. Maybe I can express \u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2 in terms of \u03b1^13.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that would help. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the product as the product over \u03b1 of (\u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2) = product over \u03b1 of (\u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2).\n\nWait, let me think about polynomials. Let\u2019s consider f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Then, the product over all roots \u03b1 of Q(x) (where Q(x) = x^13 - 1) of f(\u03b1) is equal to the resultant of Q(x) and f(x). The resultant can be computed as the product of f(\u03b1_i) for each root \u03b1_i of Q(x). So, the resultant Res(Q, f) = product_{\u03b1_i} f(\u03b1_i).\n\nBut how do I compute that? I think the resultant can also be expressed as the determinant of the Sylvester matrix, but that might be complicated here. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate it to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of Q(x) and f(x). If Q(x) and f(x) are coprime, then the resultant is non-zero, but I don't think that directly helps.\n\nWait, another idea: Since Q(x) = x^13 - 1, and f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Let's compute the product over \u03b1 of f(\u03b1) = product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2). Since \u03b1^13 = 1, maybe we can find a way to express \u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2 in terms that can be simplified using \u03b1^13 = 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider f(\u03b1) = \u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2 and relate it to \u03b1^13.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor f(\u03b1) as (\u03b1 - a)(\u03b1 - b), but let me see if f(x) factors. Let's find the roots of f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, f(x) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, f(x) factors into (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Therefore, the product over \u03b1 of f(\u03b1) is equal to the product over \u03b1 of (\u03b1 - (1 + i))(\u03b1 - (1 - i)).\n\nBut that product is equal to the product over \u03b1 of (\u03b1 - (1 + i)) multiplied by the product over \u03b1 of (\u03b1 - (1 - i)). So, each of these products is the product of (\u03b1 - c) for each root \u03b1 of Q(x) = x^13 - 1.\n\nWait, but the product over \u03b1 of (\u03b1 - c) is equal to Q(c), right? Because Q(x) = product_{\u03b1} (x - \u03b1), so evaluating at x = c gives Q(c) = product_{\u03b1} (c - \u03b1) = (-1)^13 product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - c) = - product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - c). Therefore, product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - c) = - Q(c).\n\nSo, product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - c) = - (c^13 - 1). So, in our case, for c = 1 + i and c = 1 - i, we have:\n\nproduct_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - (1 + i)) = - ((1 + i)^13 - 1)\n\nproduct_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - (1 - i)) = - ((1 - i)^13 - 1)\n\nTherefore, the total product is [ - ((1 + i)^13 - 1) ] * [ - ((1 - i)^13 - 1) ].\n\nSimplifying, that's [ -1 * ((1 + i)^13 - 1) ] * [ -1 * ((1 - i)^13 - 1) ] = (-1)^2 * [ ((1 + i)^13 - 1) * ((1 - i)^13 - 1) ] = 1 * [ ((1 + i)^13 - 1) * ((1 - i)^13 - 1) ].\n\nSo, the product we're looking for is [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nNow, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^n. I remember that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is \u03c0/4 radians since it's in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNext, the exponents e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4} and e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute 13\u03c0/4. 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, which is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, let me subtract 2\u03c0 until it's within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) - i\u221a2/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) + i\u221a2/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64\u221a2 * [ (-\u221a2/2) - i\u221a2/2 ] = 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2)(1 + i).\n\nLet me compute that: 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * ( (\u221a2)(-\u221a2) ) / 2 = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64\u221a2 * [ (-\u221a2/2) + i\u221a2/2 ] = 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2)(1 - i).\n\nCompute that: 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2) = same as above, which is -64.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), and (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 - i) - 1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nNow, the product is [ -65 -64i ] * [ -65 +64i ].\n\nThat's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nCompute the modulus squared: (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n65 squared: 60^2 = 3600, 5^2=25, 2*60*5=600, so 3600 + 600 +25=4225.\n\n64 squared: 60^2=3600, 4^2=16, 2*60*4=480, so 3600+480+16=4096.\n\nAdding 4225 + 4096: 4225 + 4000=8225, plus 96=8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the product was [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1 -i)^13 -1 ] = 8321. But that's the product over all roots \u03b1 of Q(x) of f(\u03b1). However, in the original problem, the product is over k=1 to 12, which are the roots \u03b1 \u22601.\n\nWait, but when I computed product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - c) = - (c^13 -1 ), that includes all roots, including \u03b1=1. So, perhaps I need to adjust for that. Because in our case, when we take the product over \u03b1 of f(\u03b1), which is product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2), this includes \u03b1=1, but in the original problem, the product starts at k=0, which is \u03b1=1, but we saw that term is 1, so it doesn't contribute.\n\nWait, no, actually, when I computed the product over all \u03b1 of f(\u03b1), which is product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2), which includes \u03b1=1, but in the original problem, the product is from k=0 to 12, which is all \u03b1, including \u03b1=1. But earlier, I realized that when k=0, the term is 1, so the product is 1 * product_{k=1 to 12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nWait, but in my approach, I took the product over all roots \u03b1 of Q(x) (including \u03b1=1) of f(\u03b1), which is product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2). But that product is 8321, as computed above. However, in the original problem, the product is over all k=0 to 12, which is the same as over all roots \u03b1, including \u03b1=1. So, that product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the term when k=0 is 1, but let me check:\n\nAt k=0, \u03c9^0=1, so the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 +1=1. So, the product from k=0 to 12 is 1 * product_{k=1 to 12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = product_{\u03b1} (2 - 2\u03b1 + \u03b1\u00b2) where \u03b1 runs over all 13th roots of unity, including 1. So, that product is 8321.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that product over all \u03b1 of f(\u03b1) is 8321, which is correct. So, the original product is 8321. But wait, that can't be right because 8321 is a 4-digit number, and the problem asks for the remainder modulo 1000. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nFirst, let's verify the step where I said that product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - c) = - (c^13 -1 ). Because Q(x) = x^13 -1, so product_{\u03b1} (x - \u03b1) = x^13 -1. So, evaluating at x = c, we get product_{\u03b1} (c - \u03b1) = c^13 -1. But in our case, we have product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - c) = (-1)^{13} product_{\u03b1} (c - \u03b1) = (-1)^{13} (c^13 -1) = - (c^13 -1).\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nThen, product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - (1+i)) = - [ (1+i)^13 -1 ].\n\nSimilarly for (1 -i).\n\nSo, product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - (1+i)) * product_{\u03b1} (\u03b1 - (1-i)) = [ - ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ] = ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ).\n\nWait, no, because both are negative, so (-a)*(-b)=ab. So, correct.\n\nThen, I computed (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13.\n\nExpressed in polar form:\n\n1 + i = sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}, so (1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i = sqrt(2) e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 -i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i13\u03c0/4}.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) = 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nMultiply 64 sqrt(2) by -sqrt(2)/2: 64 * (sqrt(2) * -sqrt(2))/2 = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2 ) = -64 i.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 -i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ] = -64 +64i.\n\nTherefore, (1+i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nAnd (1 -i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nNow, multiply these two complex numbers: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).\n\nThis is of the form (a - b)(a + b) where a = -65 and b = -64i. So, it's a^2 - b^2.\n\nCompute a^2: (-65)^2 = 4225.\n\nCompute b^2: (-64i)^2 = (-64)^2 * i^2 = 4096 * (-1) = -4096.\n\nSo, a^2 - b^2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is indeed 8321.\n\nTherefore, the original product is 8321, and the remainder when divided by 1000 is 8321 mod 1000.\n\nCompute 8321 divided by 1000: 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the product over all \u03b1 of f(\u03b1) is indeed equal to the product we're asked to compute. Because in the original problem, the product is from k=0 to 12, which includes all 13th roots of unity, including \u03b1=1, which gives a term of 1. So, the product is 8321, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything important.\n\n1. Recognize that the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including 1, but the term at 1 is 1, so it doesn't change the product.\n\n2. Express each term as a quadratic in \u03c9^k, which is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, where x is a 13th root of unity.\n\n3. Realize that the product over all x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over all roots \u03b1 of x^13 -1 of (\u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2).\n\n4. Factor this product into two products involving (\u03b1 - (1+i)) and (\u03b1 - (1-i)).\n\n5. Use the fact that the product over all \u03b1 of (\u03b1 - c) is equal to - (c^13 -1) because Q(c) = c^13 -1.\n\n6. Compute (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13, subtract 1, and multiply the results.\n\n7. Find that the product is 8321, which modulo 1000 is 321.\n\nI think that all makes sense. So, the answer should be 321.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that the product involves terms of the form \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\) for each \\(k\\) from 0 to 12, where \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive 13th root of unity. \n\nFirst, we rewrite each term as a quadratic in \\(\\omega^k\\):\n\\[\n2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k} = \\omega^{2k} - 2\\omega^k + 2.\n\\]\nThis can be expressed as \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\) where \\(x = \\omega^k\\). \n\nThe product we need to compute is:\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2),\n\\]\nwhere \\(x\\) runs over all 13th roots of unity, including \\(x = 1\\). \n\nWe recognize that \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\) can be factored as \\((x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i))\\), where \\(1 \\pm i\\) are the roots of the quadratic. Thus, the product becomes:\n\\[\n\\prod_{x} (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)),\n\\]\nwhere the product is over all 13th roots of unity \\(x\\).\n\nUsing the property that the product of \\((x - c)\\) over all roots \\(x\\) of \\(x^{13} - 1 = 0\\) is \\(-(c^{13} - 1)\\), we compute:\n\\[\n\\prod_{x} (x - (1 + i)) = -((1 + i)^{13} - 1),\n\\]\n\\[\n\\prod_{x} (x - (1 - i)) = -((1 - i)^{13} - 1).\n\\]\nThus, the total product is:\n\\[\n[ -((1 + i)^{13} - 1) ] \\cdot [ -((1 - i)^{13} - 1) ].\n\\]\n\nNext, we compute \\((1 + i)^{13}\\) and \\((1 - i)^{13}\\). Expressing \\(1 + i\\) and \\(1 - i\\) in polar form:\n\\[\n1 + i = \\sqrt{2} e^{i\\pi/4}, \\quad 1 - i = \\sqrt{2} e^{-i\\pi/4}.\n\\]\nRaising these to the 13th power:\n\\[\n(1 + i)^{13} = (2^{1/2})^{13} e^{i \\cdot 13\\pi/4} = 64\\sqrt{2} e^{i \\cdot 5\\pi/4} = -64(1 + i),\n\\]\n\\[\n(1 - i)^{13} = (2^{1/2})^{13} e^{-i \\cdot 13\\pi/4} = 64\\sqrt{2} e^{-i \\cdot 5\\pi/4} = -64(1 - i).\n\\]\nSubtracting 1 from each:\n\\[\n(1 + i)^{13} - 1 = -65 - 64i, \\quad (1 - i)^{13} - 1 = -65 + 64i.\n\\]\nMultiplying these results:\n\\[\n(-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 8321.\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000:\n\\[\n8321 \\mod 1000 = 321.\n\\]\n\nThus, the remainder is \\(\\boxed{321}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Alright, so I have this problem here: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, okay. That seems a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy \u03c9^n = 1 for some integer n. In this case, \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, so \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9 \u2260 1. That means \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, right? So all the powers of \u03c9 from \u03c9^0 up to \u03c9^12 are distinct and are the roots of the equation x^13 - 1 = 0.\n\nNow, the problem involves a product over k from 0 to 12 of the term (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me write that out more clearly:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\n\nI need to compute this product and then find its remainder modulo 1000.\n\nHmm, okay. So the product is over all the 13th roots of unity (including \u03c9^0 = 1). Maybe there's a way to relate this product to some polynomial whose roots are these terms. Wait, but each term in the product is a function of \u03c9^k. Let me think about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can rewrite the term 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} in a more manageable form. Let's see:\n\n2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Maybe I can factor it or relate it to some polynomial equation.\n\nWait, another approach: since \u03c9^k are roots of x^13 - 1 = 0, perhaps the product can be connected to evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points. Let me recall that the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1. But in this case, each term in the product is a linear combination of \u03c9^{2k}, \u03c9^k, and constants. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor the expression 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me set z = \u03c9^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2z + z\u00b2. Let me write that as z\u00b2 - 2z + 2. Can I factor this quadratic? Let's compute the discriminant: (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo, z\u00b2 - 2z + 2 factors as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). Therefore, 2 - 2z + z\u00b2 = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, each term in the product can be written as (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nBut the product over k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - a) is equal to (a^13 - 1), because the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1. So, if we set x = a, then the product is a^13 - 1. Wait, but wait, actually, the product over (\u03c9^k - a) is the same as the product over (a - \u03c9^k) with a negative sign. Let me verify:\n\nProduct_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 Product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = - Product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = - (a^13 - 1)\n\nBecause the product (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1. So, setting x = a, the product is a^13 - 1. Therefore, Product (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 (a^13 - 1) = - (a^13 - 1).\n\nSo, applying this, the product over (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) is equal to - [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ], and similarly, the product over (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) is equal to - [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nTherefore, the entire original product is:\n\n[ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ] = [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ]\n\nSimplify this expression. Let me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI remember that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. Let's compute the modulus and argument.\n\n1 + i has modulus sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -\u03c0/4, so 1 - i = sqrt(2) e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i 13 \u03c0/4}\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i 13 \u03c0/4}\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). So, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64 sqrt(2).\n\nNow, 13 \u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13/4 = 3 + 1/4. So, 13 \u03c0/4 is the same as \u03c0/4 plus 3\u03c0, which is \u03c0/4 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0. Alternatively, 13 \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 + \u03c0, but perhaps it's easier to note that 13 \u03c0/4 is equivalent to 13 \u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13 \u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, 13 \u03c0/4 is coterminal with 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant, so its cosine and sine are negative.\n\nTherefore, e^{i 13 \u03c0/4} = e^{i 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i 13 \u03c0/4} = e^{-i 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ]\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) i = same as above, but multiplied by i: -64i.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake there. Let me recompute:\n\nWait, (1 + i)^13 is 64 sqrt(2) multiplied by ( (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) )\n\nSo, 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) * (-1/2) = 64 * (2) * (-1/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part is 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) i = same as above, but with an i: -64i.\n\nWait, no, wait: the second term is 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) i, so same as above, so that's also -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) + i 64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = same as before, -64.\n\nThe imaginary part: 64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2) i = 64 * (2)/2 i = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, now, we can plug these into the expressions for the products:\n\nProduct over (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] = - [ (-64 - 64i) - 1 ] = - [ -65 - 64i ] = 65 + 64i.\n\nSimilarly, Product over (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = - [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] = - [ (-64 + 64i) - 1 ] = - [ -65 + 64i ] = 65 - 64i.\n\nTherefore, the original product is (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i).\n\nMultiply these two complex conjugates: (65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 65\u00b2 - (64)^2 (i\u00b2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Now, the problem asks for the remainder when this is divided by 1000.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nLet me recheck:\n\n1. Expressed (1 + i) as sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}, correct.\n\n2. Raised to the 13th power: (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 sqrt(2), correct.\n\n3. 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to 5\u03c0/4, correct.\n\n4. Calculated e^{i5\u03c0/4} = (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2), correct.\n\n5. Multiply 64 sqrt(2) by that:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = -64. Similarly for the imaginary part, same calculation. So (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i, correct.\n\nSame for (1 - i)^13: got -64 +64i, correct.\n\nThen, computed the products:\n\nProduct (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] = - [ (-64 -64i) -1 ] = - [ -65 -64i ] = 65 +64i.\n\nSimilarly for the other product: 65 -64i.\n\nThen multiplied them: (65 +64i)(65 -64i) = 65\u00b2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 +4096=8321.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, 8321 mod 1000 is 321, because 1000*8=8000, 8321 -8000=321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in the steps, so the answer should be 321.\n",

Maybe I can factor it or relate it to some polynomial equation.\n\nWait, another approach: since \u03c9^k are roots of x^13 - 1 = 0, perhaps the product can be connected to evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points. Let me recall that the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1. But in this case, each term in the product is a linear combination of \u03c9^{2k}, \u03c9^k, and constants. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor the expression 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me set z = \u03c9^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2z + z\u00b2. Let me write that as z\u00b2 - 2z + 2. Can I factor this quadratic? Let's compute the discriminant: (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo, z\u00b2 - 2z + 2 factors as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). Therefore, 2 - 2z + z\u00b2 = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, each term in the product can be written as (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nBut the product over k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - a) is equal to (a^13 - 1), because the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1. So, if we set x = a, then the product is a^13 - 1. Wait, but wait, actually, the product over (\u03c9^k - a) is the same as the product over (a - \u03c9^k) with a negative sign. Let me verify:\n\nProduct_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 Product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = - Product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = - (a^13 - 1)\n\nBecause the product (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1. So, setting x = a, the product is a^13 - 1. Therefore, Product (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 (a^13 - 1) = - (a^13 - 1).\n\nSo, applying this, the product over (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) is equal to - [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ], and similarly, the product over (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) is equal to - [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nTherefore, the entire original product is:\n\n[ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ] = [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ]\n\nSimplify this expression. Let me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI remember that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. Let's compute the modulus and argument.\n\n1 + i has modulus sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -\u03c0/4, so 1 - i = sqrt(2) e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i 13 \u03c0/4}\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i 13 \u03c0/4}\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). So, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64 sqrt(2).\n\nNow, 13 \u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13/4 = 3 + 1/4. So, 13 \u03c0/4 is the same as \u03c0/4 plus 3\u03c0, which is \u03c0/4 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0. Alternatively, 13 \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 + \u03c0, but perhaps it's easier to note that 13 \u03c0/4 is equivalent to 13 \u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13 \u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, 13 \u03c0/4 is coterminal with 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant, so its cosine and sine are negative.\n\nTherefore, e^{i 13 \u03c0/4} = e^{i 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i 13 \u03c0/4} = e^{-i 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ]\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) i = same as above, but multiplied by i: -64i.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake there. Let me recompute:\n\nWait, (1 + i)^13 is 64 sqrt(2) multiplied by ( (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) )\n\nSo, 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) * (-1/2) = 64 * (2) * (-1/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part is 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) i = same as above, but with an i: -64i.\n\nWait, no, wait: the second term is 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) i, so same as above, so that's also -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) + i 64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = same as before, -64.\n\nThe imaginary part: 64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2) i = 64 * (2)/2 i = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, now, we can plug these into the expressions for the products:\n\nProduct over (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] = - [ (-64 - 64i) - 1 ] = - [ -65 - 64i ] = 65 + 64i.\n\nSimilarly, Product over (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = - [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] = - [ (-64 + 64i) - 1 ] = - [ -65 + 64i ] = 65 - 64i.\n\nTherefore, the original product is (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i).\n\nMultiply these two complex conjugates: (65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 65\u00b2 - (64)^2 (i\u00b2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Now, the problem asks for the remainder when this is divided by 1000.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nLet me recheck:\n\n1. Expressed (1 + i) as sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}, correct.\n\n2. Raised to the 13th power: (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 sqrt(2), correct.\n\n3. 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to 5\u03c0/4, correct.\n\n4. Calculated e^{i5\u03c0/4} = (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2), correct.\n\n5. Multiply 64 sqrt(2) by that:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = -64. Similarly for the imaginary part, same calculation. So (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i, correct.\n\nSame for (1 - i)^13: got -64 +64i, correct.\n\nThen, computed the products:\n\nProduct (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] = - [ (-64 -64i) -1 ] = - [ -65 -64i ] = 65 +64i.\n\nSimilarly for the other product: 65 -64i.\n\nThen multiplied them: (65 +64i)(65 -64i) = 65\u00b2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 +4096=8321.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, 8321 mod 1000 is 321, because 1000*8=8000, 8321 -8000=321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in the steps, so the answer should be 321.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the remainder when the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity. \n\nFirst, we rewrite each term as (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)), leading to the product being expressed as the product of two terms involving (1 + i) and (1 - i). Using properties of roots of unity, we compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, which yield -64 - 64i and -64 + 64i, respectively. The product of these terms results in 8321. Taking this modulo 1000 gives the remainder 321.\n\n\\boxed{321}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and not equal to 1. Hmm, 13th roots of unity... So \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k for k from 0 to 12 are all distinct roots.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Maybe I can relate this product to a polynomial whose roots are \u03c9^k. Let me think. The product given is over all 13th roots of unity except \u03c9^0, which is 1, but wait, k starts at 0. So \u03c9^0 is 1, but the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, so maybe when k=0, I have to handle it separately?\n\nWait, no, the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1 is a 13th root of unity, so maybe the product is over k=0 to 12, but when k=0, \u03c9^0=1, but the product term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 +1=1. So that term is 1. So maybe the product is 1 times the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nBut let me not jump ahead. Let's try to find a pattern or a way to simplify the expression inside the product. The term is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Maybe I can factor it or relate it to some known polynomial.\n\nLet me denote x = \u03c9^k. Since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, x is also a 13th root of unity, right? So x^13 = 1. Then, the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. Hmm, can I factor this?\n\nLet me see: x^2 - 2x + 2. Hmm, discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots would be [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). But does that help me here? Maybe, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression 2 - 2x + x^2 as part of a product over all x = \u03c9^k, which are all the 13th roots of unity except x=1, since when k=0, x=1. Wait, but in our product, when k=0, x=1, so the term is 1 as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The product is over all k from 0 to 12, so all 13th roots of unity. So each term is (2 - 2x + x^2) where x is a 13th root of unity. So the product is the product over x^13=1 of (2 - 2x + x^2). Hmm, maybe I can relate this product to evaluating a polynomial at certain points.\n\nI remember that for a polynomial P(x), the product over all roots x of P(x) of (a - x) is equal to P(a). But in this case, I have a product over all 13th roots of unity of (2 - 2x + x^2). So maybe I can think of this as evaluating the polynomial Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 at each 13th root of unity and taking the product.\n\nWait, but that's the product over x of Q(x). So that would be the product over x of (x^2 - 2x + 2), where x runs through all 13th roots of unity, including x=1. So the product is equal to the product for each x where x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write this product as the resultant or something. But perhaps a better approach is to consider that the product over all x where x^n = 1 of (a - x) is equal to a^n - 1, right? Because the product of (a - x) for all n-th roots of unity x is a^n - 1. But in this case, my expression isn't linear in x; it's quadratic.\n\nHmm. So perhaps I can consider the product over x of (x^2 - 2x + 2). Let me think about that. Let me denote y = x. So the product becomes product_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2). Now, I can think of this as product_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2).\n\nI recall that for a polynomial f(y), the product of f(y) over all y such that y^n=1 is equal to the resultant of f(y) and y^n - 1, which might be related to the value of f evaluated at the roots of y^n=1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the fact that the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the product over all y^13=1 of (y - \u03b1)(y - \u03b2), where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the roots of y^2 - 2y + 2 = 0. So the product becomes the product over y^13=1 of (y - \u03b1)(y - \u03b2) = product_{y} (y - \u03b1)(y - \u03b2) = [product_{y} (y - \u03b1)] * [product_{y} (y - \u03b2)].\n\nBut product_{y} (y - \u03b1) is equal to \u03b1^13 - 1, because product_{y} (y - \u03b1) is the same as evaluating the polynomial y^13 - 1 at y=\u03b1, which is \u03b1^13 - 1. Similarly, product_{y} (y - \u03b2) = \u03b2^13 - 1.\n\nSo the product becomes (\u03b1^13 - 1)(\u03b2^13 - 1). Now, since \u03b1 and \u03b2 are roots of y^2 - 2y + 2 = 0, we can find \u03b1^13 and \u03b2^13.\n\nWait, but \u03b1^13 is equal to (\u03b1^13), and since \u03b1 is a root of y^2 - 2y + 2 = 0, perhaps we can find a recurrence relation for \u03b1^k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find \u03b1^13 in terms of lower powers. Let's see. Since \u03b1^2 = 2\u03b1 - 2, as per the equation \u03b1^2 - 2\u03b1 + 2 = 0. So \u03b1^2 = 2\u03b1 - 2.\n\nWe can compute higher powers of \u03b1 using this relation.\n\nLet me compute \u03b1^3: \u03b1^3 = \u03b1 * \u03b1^2 = \u03b1*(2\u03b1 - 2) = 2\u03b1^2 - 2\u03b1 = 2*(2\u03b1 - 2) - 2\u03b1 = 4\u03b1 -4 -2\u03b1 = 2\u03b1 -4.\n\nSimilarly, \u03b1^4 = \u03b1 * \u03b1^3 = \u03b1*(2\u03b1 -4) = 2\u03b1^2 -4\u03b1 = 2*(2\u03b1 -2) -4\u03b1 = 4\u03b1 -4 -4\u03b1 = -4.\n\nHmm, interesting. So \u03b1^4 = -4. Then \u03b1^5 = \u03b1 * \u03b1^4 = \u03b1*(-4) = -4\u03b1.\n\n\u03b1^6 = \u03b1 * \u03b1^5 = \u03b1*(-4\u03b1) = -4\u03b1^2 = -4*(2\u03b1 -2) = -8\u03b1 +8.\n\nWait, this might take a while, but perhaps there's a pattern or a cycle.\n\nAlternatively, since \u03b1^4 = -4, then \u03b1^8 = (\u03b1^4)^2 = (-4)^2 = 16.\n\nThen \u03b1^12 = (\u03b1^8)*(\u03b1^4) = 16*(-4) = -64.\n\nThen \u03b1^13 = \u03b1^12 * \u03b1 = (-64)*\u03b1.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the exponents are getting a bit messy. Maybe I should think in terms of modulus.\n\nWait, since \u03b1 satisfies \u03b1^2 = 2\u03b1 -2, perhaps we can find a recurrence for \u03b1^n in terms of lower powers. Let me denote a_n = \u03b1^n. Then a_{n} = 2a_{n-1} - 2a_{n-2}, since from the equation y^2 = 2y -2, so a_n = 2a_{n-1} - 2a_{n-2}.\n\nHmm, maybe that's a better approach. So the recurrence is a_n = 2a_{n-1} - 2a_{n-2}, with initial conditions a_0 = 1, a_1 = \u03b1.\n\nWait, but this might not directly help me compute a_13. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern in the exponents.\n\nWait, earlier I found that \u03b1^4 = -4, \u03b1^8 = 16, \u03b1^12 = -64, so \u03b1^13 = \u03b1^12 * \u03b1 = (-64)*\u03b1. So \u03b1^13 = -64\u03b1.\n\nSimilarly, \u03b2^13 = -64\u03b2, because \u03b2 satisfies the same equation, so the same recurrence applies.\n\nSo then, (\u03b1^13 - 1) = (-64\u03b1 -1), and (\u03b2^13 -1) = (-64\u03b2 -1). So the product is (-64\u03b1 -1)(-64\u03b2 -1).\n\nLet me compute that product: (-64\u03b1 -1)(-64\u03b2 -1) = (64\u03b1 +1)(64\u03b2 +1) because negative times negative is positive.\n\nExpanding this: 64\u03b1*64\u03b2 + 64\u03b1*1 +1*64\u03b2 +1*1 = 4096\u03b1\u03b2 + 64\u03b1 + 64\u03b2 +1.\n\nNow, from the original equation, \u03b1\u03b2 = (from y^2 -2y +2=0, product of roots is 2). So \u03b1\u03b2 = 2.\n\nAlso, \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 2 (from the sum of roots).\n\nSo substituting these in:\n\n4096*2 + 64*(2) +1 = 8192 + 128 +1 = 8192 + 129 = 8321.\n\nWait, so the product over y of (y^2 -2y +2) is 8321. But wait, earlier I thought that product is equal to (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1) = 8321.\n\nBut wait, let me check my calculations again. So (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1) = (-64\u03b1 -1)(-64\u03b2 -1) = (64\u03b1 +1)(64\u03b2 +1). Expanding:\n\n= 64\u03b1*64\u03b2 +64\u03b1*1 +1*64\u03b2 +1*1\n= 4096\u03b1\u03b2 +64\u03b1 +64\u03b2 +1.\n\nSince \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 2 and \u03b1\u03b2=2,\n\n= 4096*2 + 64*(2) +1\n= 8192 + 128 +1\n= 8321.\n\nSo the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 -2y +2) is 8321. So that's the value of the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k +2) = product_{y^13=1} (y^2 -2y +2) = 8321.\n\nWait, but the problem states that \u03c9 \u22601. So in the product, when k=0, y=1, so the term is (1)^2 -2*(1) +2 = 1 -2 +2=1. So the product is 1 times the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nBut wait, in my earlier calculation, I included y=1 as part of the product, which gives 1. So the total product is 8321.\n\nWait, but when I compute the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 -2y +2), that includes y=1, which gives (1 - 2 +2)=1, so yes, that's correct. So the product is 8321.\n\nSo the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321, because 8321 \u00f7 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321. So yes, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I compute everything correctly?\n\nLet me retrace. The product is over all 13th roots of unity of (y^2 -2y +2). I said that this product is equal to the product over y of (y - \u03b1)(y - \u03b2), which is (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1). Then I found \u03b1^13 = -64\u03b1, \u03b2^13 = -64\u03b2. So (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1) = (-64\u03b1 -1)(-64\u03b2 -1) = (64\u03b1 +1)(64\u03b2 +1) = 4096\u03b1\u03b2 + 64\u03b1 +64\u03b2 +1.\n\nWith \u03b1\u03b2=2, \u03b1+\u03b2=2, so 4096*2=8192, 64*(2)=128, plus 1. So 8192+128=8320, plus 1 is 8321. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the product was 8321, so the remainder when divided by 1000 is 321.\n\nBut wait, the original problem is to compute the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). So that is the same as the product from y=\u03c9^k, where y runs over all 13th roots of unity, of (2 - 2y + y^2) = product of (y^2 -2y +2). So yes, that product is 8321.\n\nSo 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y + 2) is indeed 8321.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute the product using the fact that for a polynomial f(y), the product over all roots y of y^n =1 of f(y) is equal to the resultant or something else.

So the product is 8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more. If I compute 8321 divided by 1000, 1000*8=8000, 8321-8000=321. So yes, the remainder is 321.\n\nSo the answer should be 321.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and not equal to 1. Hmm, 13th roots of unity... So \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k for k from 0 to 12 are all distinct roots.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Maybe I can relate this product to a polynomial whose roots are \u03c9^k. Let me think. The product given is over all 13th roots of unity except \u03c9^0, which is 1, but wait, k starts at 0. So \u03c9^0 is 1, but the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, so maybe when k=0, I have to handle it separately?\n\nWait, no, the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1 is a 13th root of unity, so maybe the product is over k=0 to 12, but when k=0, \u03c9^0=1, but the product term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 +1=1. So that term is 1. So maybe the product is 1 times the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nBut let me not jump ahead. Let's try to find a pattern or a way to simplify the expression inside the product. The term is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Maybe I can factor it or relate it to some known polynomial.\n\nLet me denote x = \u03c9^k. Since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, x is also a 13th root of unity, right? So x^13 = 1. Then, the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. Hmm, can I factor this?\n\nLet me see: x^2 - 2x + 2. Hmm, discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots would be [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). But does that help me here? Maybe, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression 2 - 2x + x^2 as part of a product over all x = \u03c9^k, which are all the 13th roots of unity except x=1, since when k=0, x=1. Wait, but in our product, when k=0, x=1, so the term is 1 as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The product is over all k from 0 to 12, so all 13th roots of unity. So each term is (2 - 2x + x^2) where x is a 13th root of unity. So the product is the product over x^13=1 of (2 - 2x + x^2). Hmm, maybe I can relate this product to evaluating a polynomial at certain points.\n\nI remember that for a polynomial P(x), the product over all roots x of P(x) of (a - x) is equal to P(a). But in this case, I have a product over all 13th roots of unity of (2 - 2x + x^2). So maybe I can think of this as evaluating the polynomial Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 at each 13th root of unity and taking the product.\n\nWait, but that's the product over x of Q(x). So that would be the product over x of (x^2 - 2x + 2), where x runs through all 13th roots of unity, including x=1. So the product is equal to the product for each x where x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write this product as the resultant or something. But perhaps a better approach is to consider that the product over all x where x^n = 1 of (a - x) is equal to a^n - 1, right? Because the product of (a - x) for all n-th roots of unity x is a^n - 1. But in this case, my expression isn't linear in x; it's quadratic.\n\nHmm. So perhaps I can consider the product over x of (x^2 - 2x + 2). Let me think about that. Let me denote y = x. So the product becomes product_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2). Now, I can think of this as product_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2).\n\nI recall that for a polynomial f(y), the product of f(y) over all y such that y^n=1 is equal to the resultant of f(y) and y^n - 1, which might be related to the value of f evaluated at the roots of y^n=1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the fact that the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the product over all y^13=1 of (y - \u03b1)(y - \u03b2), where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the roots of y^2 - 2y + 2 = 0. So the product becomes the product over y^13=1 of (y - \u03b1)(y - \u03b2) = product_{y} (y - \u03b1)(y - \u03b2) = [product_{y} (y - \u03b1)] * [product_{y} (y - \u03b2)].\n\nBut product_{y} (y - \u03b1) is equal to \u03b1^13 - 1, because product_{y} (y - \u03b1) is the same as evaluating the polynomial y^13 - 1 at y=\u03b1, which is \u03b1^13 - 1. Similarly, product_{y} (y - \u03b2) = \u03b2^13 - 1.\n\nSo the product becomes (\u03b1^13 - 1)(\u03b2^13 - 1). Now, since \u03b1 and \u03b2 are roots of y^2 - 2y + 2 = 0, we can find \u03b1^13 and \u03b2^13.\n\nWait, but \u03b1^13 is equal to (\u03b1^13), and since \u03b1 is a root of y^2 - 2y + 2 = 0, perhaps we can find a recurrence relation for \u03b1^k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find \u03b1^13 in terms of lower powers. Let's see. Since \u03b1^2 = 2\u03b1 - 2, as per the equation \u03b1^2 - 2\u03b1 + 2 = 0. So \u03b1^2 = 2\u03b1 - 2.\n\nWe can compute higher powers of \u03b1 using this relation.\n\nLet me compute \u03b1^3: \u03b1^3 = \u03b1 * \u03b1^2 = \u03b1*(2\u03b1 - 2) = 2\u03b1^2 - 2\u03b1 = 2*(2\u03b1 - 2) - 2\u03b1 = 4\u03b1 -4 -2\u03b1 = 2\u03b1 -4.\n\nSimilarly, \u03b1^4 = \u03b1 * \u03b1^3 = \u03b1*(2\u03b1 -4) = 2\u03b1^2 -4\u03b1 = 2*(2\u03b1 -2) -4\u03b1 = 4\u03b1 -4 -4\u03b1 = -4.\n\nHmm, interesting. So \u03b1^4 = -4. Then \u03b1^5 = \u03b1 * \u03b1^4 = \u03b1*(-4) = -4\u03b1.\n\n\u03b1^6 = \u03b1 * \u03b1^5 = \u03b1*(-4\u03b1) = -4\u03b1^2 = -4*(2\u03b1 -2) = -8\u03b1 +8.\n\nWait, this might take a while, but perhaps there's a pattern or a cycle.\n\nAlternatively, since \u03b1^4 = -4, then \u03b1^8 = (\u03b1^4)^2 = (-4)^2 = 16.\n\nThen \u03b1^12 = (\u03b1^8)*(\u03b1^4) = 16*(-4) = -64.\n\nThen \u03b1^13 = \u03b1^12 * \u03b1 = (-64)*\u03b1.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the exponents are getting a bit messy. Maybe I should think in terms of modulus.\n\nWait, since \u03b1 satisfies \u03b1^2 = 2\u03b1 -2, perhaps we can find a recurrence for \u03b1^n in terms of lower powers. Let me denote a_n = \u03b1^n. Then a_{n} = 2a_{n-1} - 2a_{n-2}, since from the equation y^2 = 2y -2, so a_n = 2a_{n-1} - 2a_{n-2}.\n\nHmm, maybe that's a better approach. So the recurrence is a_n = 2a_{n-1} - 2a_{n-2}, with initial conditions a_0 = 1, a_1 = \u03b1.\n\nWait, but this might not directly help me compute a_13. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern in the exponents.\n\nWait, earlier I found that \u03b1^4 = -4, \u03b1^8 = 16, \u03b1^12 = -64, so \u03b1^13 = \u03b1^12 * \u03b1 = (-64)*\u03b1. So \u03b1^13 = -64\u03b1.\n\nSimilarly, \u03b2^13 = -64\u03b2, because \u03b2 satisfies the same equation, so the same recurrence applies.\n\nSo then, (\u03b1^13 - 1) = (-64\u03b1 -1), and (\u03b2^13 -1) = (-64\u03b2 -1). So the product is (-64\u03b1 -1)(-64\u03b2 -1).\n\nLet me compute that product: (-64\u03b1 -1)(-64\u03b2 -1) = (64\u03b1 +1)(64\u03b2 +1) because negative times negative is positive.\n\nExpanding this: 64\u03b1*64\u03b2 + 64\u03b1*1 +1*64\u03b2 +1*1 = 4096\u03b1\u03b2 + 64\u03b1 + 64\u03b2 +1.\n\nNow, from the original equation, \u03b1\u03b2 = (from y^2 -2y +2=0, product of roots is 2). So \u03b1\u03b2 = 2.\n\nAlso, \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 2 (from the sum of roots).\n\nSo substituting these in:\n\n4096*2 + 64*(2) +1 = 8192 + 128 +1 = 8192 + 129 = 8321.\n\nWait, so the product over y of (y^2 -2y +2) is 8321. But wait, earlier I thought that product is equal to (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1) = 8321.\n\nBut wait, let me check my calculations again. So (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1) = (-64\u03b1 -1)(-64\u03b2 -1) = (64\u03b1 +1)(64\u03b2 +1). Expanding:\n\n= 64\u03b1*64\u03b2 +64\u03b1*1 +1*64\u03b2 +1*1\n= 4096\u03b1\u03b2 +64\u03b1 +64\u03b2 +1.\n\nSince \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 2 and \u03b1\u03b2=2,\n\n= 4096*2 + 64*(2) +1\n= 8192 + 128 +1\n= 8321.\n\nSo the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 -2y +2) is 8321. So that's the value of the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k +2) = product_{y^13=1} (y^2 -2y +2) = 8321.\n\nWait, but the problem states that \u03c9 \u22601. So in the product, when k=0, y=1, so the term is (1)^2 -2*(1) +2 = 1 -2 +2=1. So the product is 1 times the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nBut wait, in my earlier calculation, I included y=1 as part of the product, which gives 1. So the total product is 8321.\n\nWait, but when I compute the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 -2y +2), that includes y=1, which gives (1 - 2 +2)=1, so yes, that's correct. So the product is 8321.\n\nSo the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321, because 8321 \u00f7 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321. So yes, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I compute everything correctly?\n\nLet me retrace. The product is over all 13th roots of unity of (y^2 -2y +2). I said that this product is equal to the product over y of (y - \u03b1)(y - \u03b2), which is (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1). Then I found \u03b1^13 = -64\u03b1, \u03b2^13 = -64\u03b2. So (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1) = (-64\u03b1 -1)(-64\u03b2 -1) = (64\u03b1 +1)(64\u03b2 +1) = 4096\u03b1\u03b2 + 64\u03b1 +64\u03b2 +1.\n\nWith \u03b1\u03b2=2, \u03b1+\u03b2=2, so 4096*2=8192, 64*(2)=128, plus 1. So 8192+128=8320, plus 1 is 8321. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the product was 8321, so the remainder when divided by 1000 is 321.\n\nBut wait, the original problem is to compute the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). So that is the same as the product from y=\u03c9^k, where y runs over all 13th roots of unity, of (2 - 2y + y^2) = product of (y^2 -2y +2). So yes, that product is 8321.\n\nSo 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y + 2) is indeed 8321.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute the product using the fact that for a polynomial f(y), the product over all roots y of y^n =1 of f(y) is equal to the resultant or something else. Alternatively, perhaps using logarithms or exponents, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that the product over y of (y^2 -2y +2) is equal to the resultant of y^13 -1 and y^2 -2y +2.\n\nBut I think my earlier approach is correct.

So yes, the remainder is 321.\n\nSo the answer should be 321.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we consider the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is a 13th root of unity and \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\). \n\nFirst, we recognize that \\(\\omega^k\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, \\ldots, 12\\) are all the 13th roots of unity.

Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation \u03c9^13 = 1. Also, the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1.

Trying to factor this, the discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, substituting back, we have:\n\n(\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i))\n\nSo, each term in the product is (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product becomes:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] \u00d7 [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))]\n\nSo, the product is the product of two similar terms. Let me denote A = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) and B = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)), so Product = A \u00d7 B.\n\nNow, I need to compute A and B. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, the set {\u03c9^k | k = 0,1,...,12} are all the 13th roots of unity. So, the product A is the product of (x - (1 + i)) for all x being the 13th roots of unity. Similarly for B.\n\nWait a second, the product of (x - a) over all x being the roots of unity is related to the cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at 'a'. Specifically, the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) is equal to \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x), which is x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. But in this case, it's the product of (\u03c9^k - a), which is the same as (-1)^13 times \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a), because:\n\n\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^{13} \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(a)\n\nSince 13 is odd, (-1)^13 = -1.\n\nSo, A = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i)\n\nSimilarly, B = -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i)\n\nTherefore, Product = A \u00d7 B = [ -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) ] \u00d7 [ -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) ] = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) \u00d7 \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i)\n\nSo now, I need to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i), then multiply them together.\n\nBut what is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x)? It's the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + x\u00b9\u2070 + ... + x + 1.\n\nTherefore, I need to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i), then multiply the two results.\n\nWait, but computing \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can evaluate \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) \u00d7 \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) by considering that \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is a polynomial with real coefficients, so \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) \u00d7 \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = |\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i)|\u00b2. Hmm, that might be helpful because the product would then be the square of the modulus of \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the easiest way. Alternatively, maybe I can compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) \u00d7 \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) directly.\n\nWait, let me think again about \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x). Since \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the minimal polynomial for \u03c9, and it's equal to \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) because \u03c9^0 = 1 is not included. Wait, no, actually \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = \u220f_{gcd(k,13)=1} (x - \u03c9^k). But since 13 is prime, all exponents from 1 to 12 are coprime with 13, so \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k). So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k from 1 to 12.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1. So, that product is x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1, which factors into (x - 1)\u03a6\u2081\u2083(x). So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nBut in any case, the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(a). So, A = -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i), B = -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i). Thus, Product = (-\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i)) \u00d7 (-\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i)) = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) \u00d7 \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\nSo, I need to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i), then multiply them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a relationship between \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) that allows me to compute the product without evaluating each separately.\n\nWait, but 1 + i and 1 - i are complex conjugates. Since \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) has real coefficients, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) are complex conjugates. Therefore, their product is |\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i)|\u00b2, which is a real number.\n\nSo, perhaps it's easier to compute |\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i)|\u00b2.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i). Let me see if I can find another approach.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe instead of working with cyclotomic polynomials, I can think about the given product as evaluating another polynomial at certain points.\n\nWait, let's recall that the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1. So, if I set x = (1 + i), then (1 + i)^13 - 1 = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ((1 + i) - \u03c9^k).\n\nBut wait, in our earlier step, A = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i). But \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (1 + i - \u03c9^k) = (1 + i - 1)^{-1} \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (1 + i - \u03c9^k) ) = (i)^{-1} ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 )\n\nWait, wait, let's think again.\n\nWe know that \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1). So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]/[(1 + i) - 1] = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / (i)\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / [ (1 - i) - 1 ] = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / (-i)\n\nTherefore, the product \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) \u00d7 \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / i ] \u00d7 [ ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i) ].\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI remember that (1 + i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4. So, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n [cos(n\u03c0/4) + i sin(n\u03c0/4)].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -\u03c0/4, so (1 - i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n [cos(n\u03c0/4) - i sin(n\u03c0/4)].\n\nSo, let's compute (1 + i)^13:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 [cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4)].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 [cos(13\u03c0/4) - i sin(13\u03c0/4)].\n\nLet me compute 13\u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0. 13 divided by 8 is 1.625, so 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so subtract 2\u03c0: 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 5\u03c0/4.\n\nTherefore, cos(13\u03c0/4) = cos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(13\u03c0/4) = sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ] = (sqrt(2))^13 * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i)\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (-sqrt(2)/2) ] = (sqrt(2))^13 * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i)\n\nWait, let me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) * (1 + i)\n\nCompute sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2, so:\n\n= 64 * (-2/2) * (1 + i) = 64 * (-1) * (1 + i) = -64(1 + i)\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) = 64 * (-2/2) * (1 - i) = -64(1 - i)\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i) and (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\nNow, compute (1 + i)^13 - 1:\n\n= -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 - 64i - 1 = -65 - 64i\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 - i) - 1 = -64 + 64i -1 = -65 + 64i\n\nNow, let's compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( -65 - 64i ) / (i )\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 - i ) - 1 ) = ( -65 + 64i ) / ( -i )\n\nCompute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i):\n\n= ( -65 - 64i ) / i = Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:\n\n= ( (-65 - 64i)(-i) ) / (i * -i) = (65i + 64i\u00b2) / 1 = 65i -64 (since i\u00b2 = -1)\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = -64 + 65i\n\nSimilarly, compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i):\n\n= ( -65 + 64i ) / (-i ) = Multiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n= ( (-65 + 64i ) * i ) / ( (-i) * i ) = ( -65i + 64i\u00b2 ) / 1 = (-65i -64 )\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = -64 -65i\n\nNow, compute the product \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) \u00d7 \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i):\n\n= (-64 + 65i)(-64 -65i) \n\nThis is of the form (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, but since the terms are complex, actually, it's (a + bi)(a - bi) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me compute it step by step.\n\n(-64 + 65i)(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 + ... Wait, no, actually, it's (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 only if b is real. But here, it's (a + b)(a - b) where a is real and b is imaginary. Let me compute it as (a + b)(a - b):\n\n= (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225)(i\u00b2) = 4096 - 4225*(-1) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check by expanding:\n\n(-64 + 65i)(-64 -65i) = (-64)(-64) + (-64)(-65i) + (65i)(-64) + (65i)(-65i)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (-64)(-64) = 4096\n\nSecond term: (-64)(-65i) = 4160i\n\nThird term: (65i)(-64) = -4160i\n\nFourth term: (65i)(-65i) = (-65^2)(i^2) = (-4225)(-1) = 4225\n\nNow, add all terms:\n\n4096 + 4160i -4160i + 4225 = 4096 + 4225 + (4160i -4160i) = 8321 + 0i = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, that's the value of the original product, right? Because we had Product = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) \u00d7 \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = 8321.\n\nSo, the value of the product is 8321.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000.\n\n8321 \u00f7 1000 = 8 with a remainder of 321. Because 8 \u00d7 1000 = 8000, and 8321 - 8000 = 321.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nLet me recap:\n\n1. Each term in the product is (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) which factors into (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\n2. The entire product is then the product over all \u03c9^k (k=0 to 12) of these terms, which becomes [\u220f(\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] \u00d7 [\u220f(\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\n3. Each product \u220f(\u03c9^k - a) is equal to -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(a), so A = -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i), B = -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\n4. Therefore, the product is A \u00d7 B = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) \u00d7 \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\n5. Calculated \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) by using the cyclotomic polynomial formula and properties of roots of unity.\n\n6. Found that (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i) and (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\n7. Subtracted 1 from each and divided by (i) and (-i) respectively to get \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = -64 + 65i and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = -64 -65i.\n\n8. Multiplied these two complex numbers to get 8321.\n\n9. Finally, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321 when the product is divided by 1000.\n\nI think that all checks out. Let me just verify the step where I computed (1 + i)^13.\n\n(1 + i)^1 = 1 + i\n\n(1 + i)^2 = 2i\n\n(1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4\n\n(1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16\n\n(1 + i)^12 = ( (1 + i)^8 ) * ( (1 + i)^4 ) = 16 * (-4) = -64\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^12 * (1 + i) = (-64)(1 + i) = -64 -64i\n\nWait, but earlier I said (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i). Oh wait, that's correct. But when I computed (1 + i)^13 - 1, I got -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i, which is correct.\n\nThen, when I divided by i, I multiplied numerator and denominator by -i:\n\n(-65 -64i)/i = (-65 -64i)(-i)/(i * -i) = (65i + 64i\u00b2)/1 = 65i -64. So \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = -64 + 65i.\n\nSimilarly for \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i), I got -64 -65i.\n\nMultiplying these gives (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321. Correct.\n\nThus, the product is indeed 8321, and mod 1000 is 321.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.\n",

Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials.

Trying to factor this, the discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, substituting back, we have:\n\n(\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i))\n\nSo, each term in the product is (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product becomes:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] \u00d7 [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))]\n\nSo, the product is the product of two similar terms. Let me denote A = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) and B = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)), so Product = A \u00d7 B.\n\nNow, I need to compute A and B. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, the set {\u03c9^k | k = 0,1,...,12} are all the 13th roots of unity. So, the product A is the product of (x - (1 + i)) for all x being the 13th roots of unity. Similarly for B.\n\nWait a second, the product of (x - a) over all x being the roots of unity is related to the cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at 'a'. Specifically, the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) is equal to \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x), which is x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. But in this case, it's the product of (\u03c9^k - a), which is the same as (-1)^13 times \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a), because:\n\n\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^{13} \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(a)\n\nSince 13 is odd, (-1)^13 = -1.\n\nSo, A = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i)\n\nSimilarly, B = -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i)\n\nTherefore, Product = A \u00d7 B = [ -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) ] \u00d7 [ -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) ] = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) \u00d7 \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i)\n\nSo now, I need to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i), then multiply them together.\n\nBut what is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x)? It's the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + x\u00b9\u2070 + ... + x + 1.\n\nTherefore, I need to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i), then multiply the two results.\n\nWait, but computing \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can evaluate \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) \u00d7 \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) by considering that \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is a polynomial with real coefficients, so \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) \u00d7 \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = |\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i)|\u00b2. Hmm, that might be helpful because the product would then be the square of the modulus of \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the easiest way. Alternatively, maybe I can compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) \u00d7 \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) directly.\n\nWait, let me think again about \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x). Since \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the minimal polynomial for \u03c9, and it's equal to \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) because \u03c9^0 = 1 is not included. Wait, no, actually \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = \u220f_{gcd(k,13)=1} (x - \u03c9^k). But since 13 is prime, all exponents from 1 to 12 are coprime with 13, so \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k). So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k from 1 to 12.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1. So, that product is x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1, which factors into (x - 1)\u03a6\u2081\u2083(x). So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nBut in any case, the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(a). So, A = -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i), B = -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i). Thus, Product = (-\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i)) \u00d7 (-\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i)) = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) \u00d7 \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\nSo, I need to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i), then multiply them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a relationship between \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) that allows me to compute the product without evaluating each separately.\n\nWait, but 1 + i and 1 - i are complex conjugates. Since \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) has real coefficients, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) are complex conjugates. Therefore, their product is |\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i)|\u00b2, which is a real number.\n\nSo, perhaps it's easier to compute |\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i)|\u00b2.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i). Let me see if I can find another approach.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe instead of working with cyclotomic polynomials, I can think about the given product as evaluating another polynomial at certain points.\n\nWait, let's recall that the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1. So, if I set x = (1 + i), then (1 + i)^13 - 1 = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ((1 + i) - \u03c9^k).\n\nBut wait, in our earlier step, A = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i). But \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (1 + i - \u03c9^k) = (1 + i - 1)^{-1} \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (1 + i - \u03c9^k) ) = (i)^{-1} ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 )\n\nWait, wait, let's think again.\n\nWe know that \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1). So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [(1 + i)^13 - 1]/[(1 + i) - 1] = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / (i)\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / [ (1 - i) - 1 ] = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / (-i)\n\nTherefore, the product \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) \u00d7 \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / i ] \u00d7 [ ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i) ].\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI remember that (1 + i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4. So, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n [cos(n\u03c0/4) + i sin(n\u03c0/4)].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -\u03c0/4, so (1 - i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n [cos(n\u03c0/4) - i sin(n\u03c0/4)].\n\nSo, let's compute (1 + i)^13:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 [cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4)].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 [cos(13\u03c0/4) - i sin(13\u03c0/4)].\n\nLet me compute 13\u03c0/4 modulo 2\u03c0. 13 divided by 8 is 1.625, so 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so subtract 2\u03c0: 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 5\u03c0/4.\n\nTherefore, cos(13\u03c0/4) = cos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(13\u03c0/4) = sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ] = (sqrt(2))^13 * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i)\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (-sqrt(2)/2) ] = (sqrt(2))^13 * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i)\n\nWait, let me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) * (1 + i)\n\nCompute sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2, so:\n\n= 64 * (-2/2) * (1 + i) = 64 * (-1) * (1 + i) = -64(1 + i)\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) = 64 * (-2/2) * (1 - i) = -64(1 - i)\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i) and (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\nNow, compute (1 + i)^13 - 1:\n\n= -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 - 64i - 1 = -65 - 64i\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 - i) - 1 = -64 + 64i -1 = -65 + 64i\n\nNow, let's compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( -65 - 64i ) / (i )\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 - i ) - 1 ) = ( -65 + 64i ) / ( -i )\n\nCompute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i):\n\n= ( -65 - 64i ) / i = Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:\n\n= ( (-65 - 64i)(-i) ) / (i * -i) = (65i + 64i\u00b2) / 1 = 65i -64 (since i\u00b2 = -1)\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = -64 + 65i\n\nSimilarly, compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i):\n\n= ( -65 + 64i ) / (-i ) = Multiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n= ( (-65 + 64i ) * i ) / ( (-i) * i ) = ( -65i + 64i\u00b2 ) / 1 = (-65i -64 )\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = -64 -65i\n\nNow, compute the product \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) \u00d7 \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i):\n\n= (-64 + 65i)(-64 -65i) \n\nThis is of the form (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, but since the terms are complex, actually, it's (a + bi)(a - bi) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me compute it step by step.\n\n(-64 + 65i)(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 + ... Wait, no, actually, it's (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 only if b is real. But here, it's (a + b)(a - b) where a is real and b is imaginary. Let me compute it as (a + b)(a - b):\n\n= (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225)(i\u00b2) = 4096 - 4225*(-1) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check by expanding:\n\n(-64 + 65i)(-64 -65i) = (-64)(-64) + (-64)(-65i) + (65i)(-64) + (65i)(-65i)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (-64)(-64) = 4096\n\nSecond term: (-64)(-65i) = 4160i\n\nThird term: (65i)(-64) = -4160i\n\nFourth term: (65i)(-65i) = (-65^2)(i^2) = (-4225)(-1) = 4225\n\nNow, add all terms:\n\n4096 + 4160i -4160i + 4225 = 4096 + 4225 + (4160i -4160i) = 8321 + 0i = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, that's the value of the original product, right? Because we had Product = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) \u00d7 \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = 8321.\n\nSo, the value of the product is 8321.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000.\n\n8321 \u00f7 1000 = 8 with a remainder of 321. Because 8 \u00d7 1000 = 8000, and 8321 - 8000 = 321.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nLet me recap:\n\n1. Each term in the product is (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) which factors into (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\n2. The entire product is then the product over all \u03c9^k (k=0 to 12) of these terms, which becomes [\u220f(\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] \u00d7 [\u220f(\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\n3. Each product \u220f(\u03c9^k - a) is equal to -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(a), so A = -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i), B = -\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\n4. Therefore, the product is A \u00d7 B = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) \u00d7 \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\n5. Calculated \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) by using the cyclotomic polynomial formula and properties of roots of unity.\n\n6. Found that (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i) and (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\n7. Subtracted 1 from each and divided by (i) and (-i) respectively to get \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = -64 + 65i and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = -64 -65i.\n\n8. Multiplied these two complex numbers to get 8321.\n\n9. Finally, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321 when the product is divided by 1000.\n\nI think that all checks out. Let me just verify the step where I computed (1 + i)^13.\n\n(1 + i)^1 = 1 + i\n\n(1 + i)^2 = 2i\n\n(1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4\n\n(1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16\n\n(1 + i)^12 = ( (1 + i)^8 ) * ( (1 + i)^4 ) = 16 * (-4) = -64\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^12 * (1 + i) = (-64)(1 + i) = -64 -64i\n\nWait, but earlier I said (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i). Oh wait, that's correct. But when I computed (1 + i)^13 - 1, I got -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i, which is correct.\n\nThen, when I divided by i, I multiplied numerator and denominator by -i:\n\n(-65 -64i)/i = (-65 -64i)(-i)/(i * -i) = (65i + 64i\u00b2)/1 = 65i -64. So \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = -64 + 65i.\n\nSimilarly for \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i), I got -64 -65i.\n\nMultiplying these gives (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321. Correct.\n\nThus, the product is indeed 8321, and mod 1000 is 321.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that each term in the product can be factored using the properties of roots of unity. The expression \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\) can be rewritten as \\((\\omega^k - (1 + i))(\\omega^k - (1 - i))\\). Thus, the entire product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) = \\left( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 + i)) \\right) \\times \\left( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 - i)) \\right)\n\\]\n\nEach product is related to the 13th cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at \\(1 + i\\) and \\(1 - i\\). Specifically, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - a) = (-1)^{13} \\Phi_{13}(a) = -\\Phi_{13}(a)\n\\]\n\nThus, the product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{13}(1 + i) \\times \\Phi_{13}(1 - i)\n\\]\n\nUsing the cyclotomic polynomial formula, we compute \\(\\Phi_{13}(1 + i)\\) and \\(\\Phi_{13}(1 - i)\\). After simplifying, we find:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{13}(1 + i) = -64 + 65i \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Phi_{13}(1 - i) = -64 - 65i\n\\]\n\nMultiplying these results:\n\n\\[\n(-64 + 65i)(-64 - 65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000:\n\n\\[\n8321 \\mod 1000 = 321\n\\]\n\nThus, the remainder is \\(\\boxed{321}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and \u03c9 \u2260 1. Hmm, alright, let's try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that \u03c9 being a 13th root of unity means that \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k for k=0,1,...,12 are all distinct roots. So \u03c9^k cycles through all the 13th roots of unity except when k=0, which gives \u03c9^0 = 1. Wait, but the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, so maybe k starts from 1? No, wait, the product is from k=0 to 12, so it includes k=0. Hmm, but when k=0, \u03c9^0 is 1. So the term for k=0 would be 2 - 2*1 + 1^2, which is 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is just 1, which doesn't affect the product. So maybe I can ignore that term, but I'll keep it in mind.\n\nSo, the main challenge is to compute the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Wait, actually, I can write the product as (2 - 2\u03c9^0 + \u03c9^{0}) times the product from k=1 to 12. Since \u03c9^0 is 1, the first term is 1, so the entire product is just the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nNow, I need to find a way to compute this product. Maybe I can rewrite the expression inside the product. Let's look at (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Hmm, perhaps factor it or express it in terms of \u03c9^k in a more manageable way.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of this as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me write it as \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. Hmm, that's \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. Is this a quadratic that can be factored? Let's see if it factors as (\u03c9^{k} - a)(something).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider substitution. Let me set x = \u03c9^k. Then the expression becomes x^2 - 2x + 2. Hmm, can I factor this? Let's compute the discriminant: b\u00b2 - 4ac = (\u22122)^2 \u2212 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are complex. So, x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Hmm, that might be useful.\n\nSo, each term in the product can be written as (\u03c9^{k} - (1 + i))(\u03c9^{k} - (1 - i)). So, the product becomes the product from k=1 to 12 of [ (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) ].\n\nNow, since multiplication is commutative, I can rearrange this as [ product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) ] multiplied by [ product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) ].\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Now, I remember that for roots of unity, the product over all roots except one can be related to cyclotomic polynomials or something like that. Let me think about this.\n\nThe product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=1 to 12 is equal to the minimal polynomial for \u03c9, which is the cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6_13(x). Since 13 is prime, \u03a6_13(x) is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. Wait, but actually, \u03a6_13(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. So, the product over k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) is \u03a6_13(x) evaluated at x.\n\nWait, no. Wait, \u03a6_n(x) is the minimal polynomial whose roots are the primitive nth roots of unity. Since 13 is prime, all the \u03c9^k for k=1 to 12 are primitive 13th roots of unity. So, \u03a6_13(x) is the product from k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k). So, that product is \u03a6_13(x).\n\nTherefore, the product from k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nSo, in our case, for x = (1 + i), the product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) is equal to \u03a6_13(1 + i). Similarly, the other product is \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nSo, our original product is \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to computing \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i), and then taking the result modulo 1000.\n\nSo, first, let's compute \u03a6_13(x). Since \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. Alternatively, \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1), since the product over all roots is (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1). But perhaps it's easier to evaluate \u03a6_13(x) as (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nWait, yes. Because the product (x - \u03c9^1)(x - \u03c9^2)...(x - \u03c9^{12}) is equal to (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1), since all the roots are the 13th roots except x=1. So, \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nSo, substituting x = 1 + i, we have \u03a6_13(1 + i) = ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = ((1 - i)^13 - 1)/( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ((1 - i)^13 - 1)/(-i).\n\nTherefore, the product \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) is [ ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/i ] * [ ((1 - i)^13 - 1)/(-i) ].\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * (13\u03c0/4)}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * (13\u03c0/4)}.\n\nNow, let's compute e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is the same as \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Wait, no: 13\u03c0/4 divided by 2\u03c0 is 13/8, which is 1.625, so subtracting 2\u03c0 once (which is 8\u03c0/4), so 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i).\n\nSimplify: sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) is 2, so 64 * 2 * (-1/2) (1 + i) = 64 * (-1) (1 + i) = -64(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i).\n\nAgain, sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)=2, so 64 * 2 * (-1/2)(1 - i) = 64*(-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), and (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\nNow, let's compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 + i) - 1 )\n\nWe already have (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), so (1 + i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nThe denominator is (1 + i) - 1 = i.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = (-65 -64i)/i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 - i) - 1 )\n\n(1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i), so (1 - i)^13 -1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nDenominator: (1 - i) - 1 = -i.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i) = (65 -64i)/i.\n\nSo, now, the product \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) is [ (-65 -64i)/i ] * [ (65 -64i)/i ].\n\nLet me compute each term first.\n\nFirst, (-65 -64i)/i: Let's multiply numerator and denominator by i to rationalize.\n\n(-65 -64i)/i * i/i = (-65i -64i^2)/(-i^2) = (-65i +64)/1 = 64 -65i.\n\nSimilarly, (65 -64i)/i = (65 -64i)/i * i/i = (65i -64i^2)/(-i^2) = (65i +64)/1 = 64 +65i.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = 64 -65i, and \u03a6_13(1 - i) = 64 +65i.\n\nTherefore, the product is (64 -65i)(64 +65i). This is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nSo, (64)^2 + (65)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) is 8321.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, (64 -65i)(64 +65i) = 64^2 + (65i)^2 - (65i)^2? Wait, no. Wait, it's (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, but here a=64, b=65i.\n\nWait, no, actually, that's not correct. Wait, (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2. But here, a is 64 and b is 65i. So, (64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (65^2)(i^2) = 4096 - (4225)(-1) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me go back to \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i). So, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = (-65 -64i)/i = 64 -65i, as I computed. Similarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = (65 -64i)/(-i) = (65 -64i)/(-i) = (65 -64i)/(-i) * i/i = (-65i +64i^2)/(-i^2) = (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i. Wait, wait, did I make a mistake here earlier?\n\nWait, let's recompute \u03a6_13(1 - i):\n\n\u03a6_13(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = [ -64(1 - i) - 1 ] / ( -i )\n\nWhich is [ -64 +64i -1 ] / (-i ) = [ -65 +64i ] / (-i )\n\nSo, (-65 +64i)/(-i) = multiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n= [ (-65 +64i) * i ] / (-i * i ) = [ -65i +64i\u00b2 ] / ( (-i\u00b2) )\n\n= [ -65i -64 ] / 1 = -64 -65i.\n\nWait, that's different from what I had earlier. So, previously, I thought \u03a6_13(1 - i) was 64 +65i, but now I see it's -64 -65i. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\n(65 -64i)/i: Let me compute this again.\n\n(65 -64i)/i = multiply numerator and denominator by i: (65i -64i\u00b2)/i\u00b2 = (65i +64)/(-1) = (-65i -64).\n\nWait, so (65 -64i)/i = -64 -65i.\n\nWait, so perhaps earlier I made a mistake in computing \u03a6_13(1 - i). Let me correct that.\n\n\u03a6_13(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = [ -64(1 - i) -1 ] / ( -i )\n\nWhich is [ -64 +64i -1 ] / (-i ) = (-65 +64i)/(-i )\n\nWhich is equal to [ (-65 +64i) ] / (-i )\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by i: [ (-65 +64i)*i ] / (-i * i ) = [ -65i +64i\u00b2 ] / ( (-i\u00b2) ) = [ -65i -64 ] / 1 = -65i -64 = -64 -65i.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 - i) is -64 -65i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 + i) was (-65 -64i)/i = 64 -65i.\n\nSo, the product \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) is (64 -65i) * (-64 -65i).\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, the product is (64 -65i)*(-64 -65i). Let me compute that.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n= 64*(-64) + 64*(-65i) + (-65i)*(-64) + (-65i)*(-65i)\n\n= -4096 -4160i + 4160i + 4225i\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n\n-4096 + 0i + 4225*(-1) because i\u00b2 = -1.\n\nSo, -4096 -4225 = -(4096 +4225) = -(8321) = -8321.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So earlier I thought it was 8321, but now it's -8321.\n\nWait, but that can't be. Because the original product is a product of complex conjugates, so it should be a positive real number.\n\nWait, but in this case, \u03a6_13(1 + i) is 64 -65i, and \u03a6_13(1 - i) is -64 -65i. So, these are not conjugates of each other. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing \u03a6_13(1 - i). Let me double-check.\n\n\u03a6_13(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ] / ( (1 - i) - 1 )\n\nWe have (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i), as computed earlier.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 -1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nDenominator: (1 - i) -1 = -i.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i) = multiply numerator and denominator by i: [ (-65 +64i)*i ] / ( (-i)*i ) = [ -65i +64i\u00b2 ] / (1) = [ -65i -64 ] = -64 -65i.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, \u03a6_13(1 - i) is indeed -64 -65i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 + i) is 64 -65i.\n\nSo, the product is (64 -65i)*(-64 -65i).\n\nLet me compute this product again.\n\nMultiply using FOIL:\n\nFirst: 64*(-64) = -4096\n\nOuter: 64*(-65i) = -4160i\n\nInner: (-65i)*(-64) = +4160i\n\nLast: (-65i)*(-65i) = 4225i\u00b2 = 4225*(-1) = -4225.\n\nNow, add all these terms:\n\n-4096 -4160i +4160i -4225.\n\nThe -4160i and +4160i cancel out, leaving -4096 -4225 = -(4096 +4225) = -8321.\n\nHmm, so the product is -8321. But the original product we're computing is a product of terms that are all complex numbers, but the product ends up being a negative real number? That seems possible, but let me think about the original problem.\n\nWait, the original product is the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), which is equal to 1 * product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nBut each term (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is a complex number, but when multiplied together, the product is a real number. Hmm, but in our computation, we got -8321, which is a negative real number. But when we think about the product of complex numbers, it can result in a negative real number if the number of terms is even, or something like that.\n\nWait, but 12 terms, so an even number, each term being complex conjugate pairs maybe? Hmm, not necessarily. Alternatively, perhaps the product is negative, but let me think if that makes sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign somewhere. Let me check the computation again.\n\nWait, when I computed \u03a6_13(1 + i), I had [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] / ( (1 + i) -1 ) = (-64(1 + i) -1 ) / i = (-64 -64i -1 ) / i = (-65 -64i)/i.\n\nThen, I multiplied numerator and denominator by i to get (-65i -64i\u00b2)/i\u00b2 = (-65i +64)/(-1) = 64 -65i. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for \u03a6_13(1 - i), I had [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ] / ( (1 - i) -1 ) = (-64(1 - i) -1 ) / (-i ) = (-64 +64i -1 ) / (-i ) = (-65 +64i ) / (-i ).\n\nThen, I multiplied numerator and denominator by i to get [ (-65 +64i ) * i ] / ( (-i ) * i ) = [ -65i +64i\u00b2 ] / 1 = [ -65i -64 ] = -64 -65i. Correct.\n\nSo, the product is (64 -65i)*(-64 -65i).\n\nWait, let's compute this again:\n\n(64 -65i)*(-64 -65i) = 64*(-64) + 64*(-65i) + (-65i)*(-64) + (-65i)*(-65i)\n\n= (-4096) + (-4160i) + (4160i) + (4225i\u00b2)\n\nSimplify:\n\n-4096 + 0i + 4225*(-1) = -4096 -4225 = -8321.\n\nSo, yes, the product is -8321.\n\nWait, but the original product is a product of terms that are each (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), which are complex numbers, but when you take the product, it's a real number, but negative. Hmm, that's possible.\n\nWait, but let's think about the original problem again. The product from k=0 to 12 is equal to 1 * product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} ), which equals 1 * [\u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) ] = -8321.\n\nWait, but the product is a real number. So, perhaps the product is -8321, and we need to find its remainder modulo 1000.\n\nSo, -8321 mod 1000. Well, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 = 8000, with a remainder of 321. So, 8321 = 8*1000 + 321, so 8321 mod 1000 is 321. But since the number is negative, -8321 mod 1000 would be 1000 - 321 = 679.\n\nWait, because in modulo arithmetic, -8321 \u2261 -8321 + 9*1000 = -8321 + 9000 = 679 mod 1000.\n\nSo, the remainder when -8321 is divided by 1000 is 679.\n\nWait, but let me check that again.\n\nCompute 8321 \u00f7 1000: 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321, so 8321 \u2261 321 mod 1000.\n\nThus, -8321 \u2261 -321 mod 1000. But to make it positive, add 1000: -321 + 1000 = 679.\n\nSo, -8321 mod 1000 is 679.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 679.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because I thought the product might be positive, but it turned out negative. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, when I computed \u03a6_13(1 + i) as 64 -65i and \u03a6_13(1 - i) as -64 -65i, their product is indeed (64 -65i)(-64 -65i) = -8321.\n\nSo, the product is -8321, which modulo 1000 is 679.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if the original product is indeed -8321, or maybe I missed a negative sign somewhere.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I can compute the product as |\u03a6_13(1 + i)|^2, but that would be the case if \u03a6_13(1 - i) is the conjugate of \u03a6_13(1 + i). But in this case, it's not, because \u03a6_13(1 - i) is -64 -65i, while the conjugate of \u03a6_13(1 + i) would be 64 +65i, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me think again.\n\nWait, \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 -1)/(x - 1). So, when x = 1 + i, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) / i.\n\nWe found that (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), so \u03a6_13(1 + i) = (-64(1 + i) -1 ) / i = (-64 -64i -1 ) / i = (-65 -64i)/i.\n\nWhich we simplified to 64 -65i by multiplying numerator and denominator by i: (-65 -64i)*i / (i * i ) = (-65i -64i\u00b2)/(-1) = (-65i +64)/(-1) = 64 -65i.\n\nWait, that's correct. Similarly, for x = 1 - i, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ( -64(1 - i) -1 ) / (-i ) = (-64 +64i -1 ) / (-i ) = (-65 +64i ) / (-i ).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65 +64i)*i / (-i * i ) = (-65i +64i\u00b2)/1 = (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.\n\nSo, correct again.\n\nThus, the product is (64 -65i)*(-64 -65i) = -8321.\n\nSo, the remainder when this is divided by 1000 is 679.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit concerned because the product being negative seems a bit odd. Let me check if perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I can compute the product as the absolute value squared, but perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when computing (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nWait, let me recompute (1 + i)^13.\n\nWe know that 1 + i has modulus sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4, so (1 + i)^n has modulus (sqrt(2))^n and angle n\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13: modulus is (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64*sqrt(2).\n\nAngle is 13*(\u03c0/4) = (12 + 1)*\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0 = \u03c0/4 + \u03c0 + 2\u03c0 = 5\u03c0/4, but since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, 5\u03c0/4 is equivalent to -3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64*(-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i). Correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ) = -64(1 - i). Correct.\n\nSo, substitution seems correct.\n\nThus, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = (-65 -64i)/i = 64 -65i.\n\n\u03a6_13(1 - i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i) = multiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65i +64i\u00b2)/(-i\u00b2) = (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.\n\nSo, the product is indeed (64 -65i)*(-64 -65i) = -8321.\n\nSo, the remainder when -8321 is divided by 1000 is 679.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 679.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and \u03c9 \u2260 1. Hmm, alright, let's try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that \u03c9 being a 13th root of unity means that \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k for k=0,1,...,12 are all distinct roots. So \u03c9^k cycles through all the 13th roots of unity except when k=0, which gives \u03c9^0 = 1. Wait, but the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, so maybe k starts from 1? No, wait, the product is from k=0 to 12, so it includes k=0. Hmm, but when k=0, \u03c9^0 is 1. So the term for k=0 would be 2 - 2*1 + 1^2, which is 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is just 1, which doesn't affect the product. So maybe I can ignore that term, but I'll keep it in mind.\n\nSo, the main challenge is to compute the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Wait, actually, I can write the product as (2 - 2\u03c9^0 + \u03c9^{0}) times the product from k=1 to 12. Since \u03c9^0 is 1, the first term is 1, so the entire product is just the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nNow, I need to find a way to compute this product. Maybe I can rewrite the expression inside the product. Let's look at (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Hmm, perhaps factor it or express it in terms of \u03c9^k in a more manageable way.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of this as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me write it as \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. Hmm, that's \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. Is this a quadratic that can be factored? Let's see if it factors as (\u03c9^{k} - a)(something).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider substitution. Let me set x = \u03c9^k. Then the expression becomes x^2 - 2x + 2. Hmm, can I factor this? Let's compute the discriminant: b\u00b2 - 4ac = (\u22122)^2 \u2212 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are complex. So, x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Hmm, that might be useful.\n\nSo, each term in the product can be written as (\u03c9^{k} - (1 + i))(\u03c9^{k} - (1 - i)). So, the product becomes the product from k=1 to 12 of [ (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) ].\n\nNow, since multiplication is commutative, I can rearrange this as [ product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) ] multiplied by [ product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) ].\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Now, I remember that for roots of unity, the product over all roots except one can be related to cyclotomic polynomials or something like that. Let me think about this.\n\nThe product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=1 to 12 is equal to the minimal polynomial for \u03c9, which is the cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6_13(x). Since 13 is prime, \u03a6_13(x) is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. Wait, but actually, \u03a6_13(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. So, the product over k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) is \u03a6_13(x) evaluated at x.\n\nWait, no. Wait, \u03a6_n(x) is the minimal polynomial whose roots are the primitive nth roots of unity. Since 13 is prime, all the \u03c9^k for k=1 to 12 are primitive 13th roots of unity. So, \u03a6_13(x) is the product from k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k). So, that product is \u03a6_13(x).\n\nTherefore, the product from k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nSo, in our case, for x = (1 + i), the product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) is equal to \u03a6_13(1 + i). Similarly, the other product is \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nSo, our original product is \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to computing \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i), and then taking the result modulo 1000.\n\nSo, first, let's compute \u03a6_13(x). Since \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. Alternatively, \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1), since the product over all roots is (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1). But perhaps it's easier to evaluate \u03a6_13(x) as (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nWait, yes. Because the product (x - \u03c9^1)(x - \u03c9^2)...(x - \u03c9^{12}) is equal to (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1), since all the roots are the 13th roots except x=1. So, \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nSo, substituting x = 1 + i, we have \u03a6_13(1 + i) = ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = ((1 - i)^13 - 1)/( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ((1 - i)^13 - 1)/(-i).\n\nTherefore, the product \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) is [ ((1 + i)^13 - 1)/i ] * [ ((1 - i)^13 - 1)/(-i) ].\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * (13\u03c0/4)}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * (13\u03c0/4)}.\n\nNow, let's compute e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is the same as \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Wait, no: 13\u03c0/4 divided by 2\u03c0 is 13/8, which is 1.625, so subtracting 2\u03c0 once (which is 8\u03c0/4), so 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, e^{i5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i).\n\nSimplify: sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) is 2, so 64 * 2 * (-1/2) (1 + i) = 64 * (-1) (1 + i) = -64(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i).\n\nAgain, sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)=2, so 64 * 2 * (-1/2)(1 - i) = 64*(-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), and (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\nNow, let's compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 + i) - 1 )\n\nWe already have (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), so (1 + i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nThe denominator is (1 + i) - 1 = i.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = (-65 -64i)/i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 - i) - 1 )\n\n(1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i), so (1 - i)^13 -1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nDenominator: (1 - i) - 1 = -i.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i) = (65 -64i)/i.\n\nSo, now, the product \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) is [ (-65 -64i)/i ] * [ (65 -64i)/i ].\n\nLet me compute each term first.\n\nFirst, (-65 -64i)/i: Let's multiply numerator and denominator by i to rationalize.\n\n(-65 -64i)/i * i/i = (-65i -64i^2)/(-i^2) = (-65i +64)/1 = 64 -65i.\n\nSimilarly, (65 -64i)/i = (65 -64i)/i * i/i = (65i -64i^2)/(-i^2) = (65i +64)/1 = 64 +65i.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = 64 -65i, and \u03a6_13(1 - i) = 64 +65i.\n\nTherefore, the product is (64 -65i)(64 +65i). This is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nSo, (64)^2 + (65)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) is 8321.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, (64 -65i)(64 +65i) = 64^2 + (65i)^2 - (65i)^2? Wait, no. Wait, it's (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, but here a=64, b=65i.\n\nWait, no, actually, that's not correct. Wait, (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2. But here, a is 64 and b is 65i. So, (64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (65^2)(i^2) = 4096 - (4225)(-1) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me go back to \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i). So, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = (-65 -64i)/i = 64 -65i, as I computed. Similarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = (65 -64i)/(-i) = (65 -64i)/(-i) = (65 -64i)/(-i) * i/i = (-65i +64i^2)/(-i^2) = (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i. Wait, wait, did I make a mistake here earlier?\n\nWait, let's recompute \u03a6_13(1 - i):\n\n\u03a6_13(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = [ -64(1 - i) - 1 ] / ( -i )\n\nWhich is [ -64 +64i -1 ] / (-i ) = [ -65 +64i ] / (-i )\n\nSo, (-65 +64i)/(-i) = multiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n= [ (-65 +64i) * i ] / (-i * i ) = [ -65i +64i\u00b2 ] / ( (-i\u00b2) )\n\n= [ -65i -64 ] / 1 = -64 -65i.\n\nWait, that's different from what I had earlier. So, previously, I thought \u03a6_13(1 - i) was 64 +65i, but now I see it's -64 -65i. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\n(65 -64i)/i: Let me compute this again.\n\n(65 -64i)/i = multiply numerator and denominator by i: (65i -64i\u00b2)/i\u00b2 = (65i +64)/(-1) = (-65i -64).\n\nWait, so (65 -64i)/i = -64 -65i.\n\nWait, so perhaps earlier I made a mistake in computing \u03a6_13(1 - i). Let me correct that.\n\n\u03a6_13(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = [ -64(1 - i) -1 ] / ( -i )\n\nWhich is [ -64 +64i -1 ] / (-i ) = (-65 +64i)/(-i )\n\nWhich is equal to [ (-65 +64i) ] / (-i )\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by i: [ (-65 +64i)*i ] / (-i * i ) = [ -65i +64i\u00b2 ] / ( (-i\u00b2) ) = [ -65i -64 ] / 1 = -65i -64 = -64 -65i.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 - i) is -64 -65i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 + i) was (-65 -64i)/i = 64 -65i.\n\nSo, the product \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) is (64 -65i) * (-64 -65i).\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, the product is (64 -65i)*(-64 -65i). Let me compute that.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n= 64*(-64) + 64*(-65i) + (-65i)*(-64) + (-65i)*(-65i)\n\n= -4096 -4160i + 4160i + 4225i\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n\n-4096 + 0i + 4225*(-1) because i\u00b2 = -1.\n\nSo, -4096 -4225 = -(4096 +4225) = -(8321) = -8321.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So earlier I thought it was 8321, but now it's -8321.\n\nWait, but that can't be. Because the original product is a product of complex conjugates, so it should be a positive real number.\n\nWait, but in this case, \u03a6_13(1 + i) is 64 -65i, and \u03a6_13(1 - i) is -64 -65i. So, these are not conjugates of each other. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing \u03a6_13(1 - i). Let me double-check.\n\n\u03a6_13(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ] / ( (1 - i) - 1 )\n\nWe have (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i), as computed earlier.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 -1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nDenominator: (1 - i) -1 = -i.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i) = multiply numerator and denominator by i: [ (-65 +64i)*i ] / ( (-i)*i ) = [ -65i +64i\u00b2 ] / (1) = [ -65i -64 ] = -64 -65i.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, \u03a6_13(1 - i) is indeed -64 -65i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 + i) is 64 -65i.\n\nSo, the product is (64 -65i)*(-64 -65i).\n\nLet me compute this product again.\n\nMultiply using FOIL:\n\nFirst: 64*(-64) = -4096\n\nOuter: 64*(-65i) = -4160i\n\nInner: (-65i)*(-64) = +4160i\n\nLast: (-65i)*(-65i) = 4225i\u00b2 = 4225*(-1) = -4225.\n\nNow, add all these terms:\n\n-4096 -4160i +4160i -4225.\n\nThe -4160i and +4160i cancel out, leaving -4096 -4225 = -(4096 +4225) = -8321.\n\nHmm, so the product is -8321. But the original product we're computing is a product of terms that are all complex numbers, but the product ends up being a negative real number? That seems possible, but let me think about the original problem.\n\nWait, the original product is the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), which is equal to 1 * product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nBut each term (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is a complex number, but when multiplied together, the product is a real number. Hmm, but in our computation, we got -8321, which is a negative real number. But when we think about the product of complex numbers, it can result in a negative real number if the number of terms is even, or something like that.\n\nWait, but 12 terms, so an even number, each term being complex conjugate pairs maybe? Hmm, not necessarily. Alternatively, perhaps the product is negative, but let me think if that makes sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign somewhere. Let me check the computation again.\n\nWait, when I computed \u03a6_13(1 + i), I had [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] / ( (1 + i) -1 ) = (-64(1 + i) -1 ) / i = (-64 -64i -1 ) / i = (-65 -64i)/i.\n\nThen, I multiplied numerator and denominator by i to get (-65i -64i\u00b2)/i\u00b2 = (-65i +64)/(-1) = 64 -65i. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for \u03a6_13(1 - i), I had [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ] / ( (1 - i) -1 ) = (-64(1 - i) -1 ) / (-i ) = (-64 +64i -1 ) / (-i ) = (-65 +64i ) / (-i ).\n\nThen, I multiplied numerator and denominator by i to get [ (-65 +64i ) * i ] / ( (-i ) * i ) = [ -65i +64i\u00b2 ] / 1 = [ -65i -64 ] = -64 -65i. Correct.\n\nSo, the product is (64 -65i)*(-64 -65i).\n\nWait, let's compute this again:\n\n(64 -65i)*(-64 -65i) = 64*(-64) + 64*(-65i) + (-65i)*(-64) + (-65i)*(-65i)\n\n= (-4096) + (-4160i) + (4160i) + (4225i\u00b2)\n\nSimplify:\n\n-4096 + 0i + 4225*(-1) = -4096 -4225 = -8321.\n\nSo, yes, the product is -8321.\n\nWait, but the original product is a product of terms that are each (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), which are complex numbers, but when you take the product, it's a real number, but negative. Hmm, that's possible.\n\nWait, but let's think about the original problem again. The product from k=0 to 12 is equal to 1 * product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} ), which equals 1 * [\u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) ] = -8321.\n\nWait, but the product is a real number. So, perhaps the product is -8321, and we need to find its remainder modulo 1000.\n\nSo, -8321 mod 1000. Well, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 = 8000, with a remainder of 321. So, 8321 = 8*1000 + 321, so 8321 mod 1000 is 321. But since the number is negative, -8321 mod 1000 would be 1000 - 321 = 679.\n\nWait, because in modulo arithmetic, -8321 \u2261 -8321 + 9*1000 = -8321 + 9000 = 679 mod 1000.\n\nSo, the remainder when -8321 is divided by 1000 is 679.\n\nWait, but let me check that again.\n\nCompute 8321 \u00f7 1000: 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321, so 8321 \u2261 321 mod 1000.\n\nThus, -8321 \u2261 -321 mod 1000. But to make it positive, add 1000: -321 + 1000 = 679.\n\nSo, -8321 mod 1000 is 679.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 679.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because I thought the product might be positive, but it turned out negative. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, when I computed \u03a6_13(1 + i) as 64 -65i and \u03a6_13(1 - i) as -64 -65i, their product is indeed (64 -65i)(-64 -65i) = -8321.\n\nSo, the product is -8321, which modulo 1000 is 679.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if the original product is indeed -8321, or maybe I missed a negative sign somewhere.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I can compute the product as |\u03a6_13(1 + i)|^2, but that would be the case if \u03a6_13(1 - i) is the conjugate of \u03a6_13(1 + i). But in this case, it's not, because \u03a6_13(1 - i) is -64 -65i, while the conjugate of \u03a6_13(1 + i) would be 64 +65i, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me think again.\n\nWait, \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 -1)/(x - 1). So, when x = 1 + i, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) / i.\n\nWe found that (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), so \u03a6_13(1 + i) = (-64(1 + i) -1 ) / i = (-64 -64i -1 ) / i = (-65 -64i)/i.\n\nWhich we simplified to 64 -65i by multiplying numerator and denominator by i: (-65 -64i)*i / (i * i ) = (-65i -64i\u00b2)/(-1) = (-65i +64)/(-1) = 64 -65i.\n\nWait, that's correct. Similarly, for x = 1 - i, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ( -64(1 - i) -1 ) / (-i ) = (-64 +64i -1 ) / (-i ) = (-65 +64i ) / (-i ).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65 +64i)*i / (-i * i ) = (-65i +64i\u00b2)/1 = (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.\n\nSo, correct again.\n\nThus, the product is (64 -65i)*(-64 -65i) = -8321.\n\nSo, the remainder when this is divided by 1000 is 679.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit concerned because the product being negative seems a bit odd. Let me check if perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I can compute the product as the absolute value squared, but perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when computing (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nWait, let me recompute (1 + i)^13.\n\nWe know that 1 + i has modulus sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4, so (1 + i)^n has modulus (sqrt(2))^n and angle n\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13: modulus is (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64*sqrt(2).\n\nAngle is 13*(\u03c0/4) = (12 + 1)*\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0 = \u03c0/4 + \u03c0 + 2\u03c0 = 5\u03c0/4, but since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, 5\u03c0/4 is equivalent to -3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64*(-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i). Correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ) = -64(1 - i). Correct.\n\nSo, substitution seems correct.\n\nThus, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = (-65 -64i)/i = 64 -65i.\n\n\u03a6_13(1 - i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i) = multiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65i +64i\u00b2)/(-i\u00b2) = (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.\n\nSo, the product is indeed (64 -65i)*(-64 -65i) = -8321.\n\nSo, the remainder when -8321 is divided by 1000 is 679.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 679.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega\\) is a 13th root of unity and \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\).\n\n1. **Simplify the Product**:\n   The term for \\(k=0\\) is \\(2 - 2\\omega^0 + \\omega^{0} = 1\\), so the product reduces to \\(\\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\).\n\n2. **Express in Terms of \\(\\omega^k\\)**:\n   Each term can be written as \\((2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\), which factors as \\((\\omega^k - (1 + i))(\\omega^k - (1 - i))\\).\n\n3. **Use Cyclotomic Polynomial**:\n   The product \\(\\prod_{k=1}^{12}(\\omega^k - x)\\) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial \\(\\Phi_{13}(x)\\), which is \\(\\frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1}\\).\n\n4. **Evaluate at \\(x = 1 + i\\) and \\(x = 1 - i\\)**:\n   Compute \\(\\Phi_{13}(1 + i)\\) and \\(\\Phi_{13}(1 - i)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{13}(1 + i) = \\frac{(1 + i)^{13} - 1}{(1 + i) - 1} = \\frac{-64(1 + i) - 1}{i} = 64 - 65i\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{13}(1 - i) = \\frac{(1 - i)^{13} - 1}{(1 - i) - 1} = \\frac{-64(1 - i) - 1}{-i} = -64 - 65i\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compute the Product**:\n   The product is \\((64 - 65i)(-64 - 65i) = -8321\\).\n\n6. **Find the Remainder Modulo 1000**:\n   Compute \\(-8321 \\mod 1000\\):\n   \\[\n   -8321 \\equiv -321 \\mod 1000 \\equiv 679 \\mod 1000\n   \\]\n\nThe remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is \\(\\boxed{679}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Alright, so I have this problem: I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and \u03c9 \u2260 1. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity because \u03c9 \u2260 1. That means \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k \u2260 1 for any k from 1 to 12. So, \u03c9^k cycles through all the 13th roots of unity except 1 as k goes from 0 to 12.\n\nThe product is over k=0 to 12, so that's all the 13th roots of unity. Each term in the product is (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor or simplify it somehow.\n\nLet me write the term as 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let's see if I can factor this expression. Maybe factor out a 2 from the first two terms: 2(1 - \u03c9^k) + \u03c9^{2k}. Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of it as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let's let x = \u03c9^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. So, x^2 - 2x + 2. Hmm, can this quadratic be factored? Let me check the discriminant: (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. Since the discriminant is negative, it doesn't factor over the reals, but maybe over complex numbers. But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Since \u03c9 is a root of unity, perhaps we can relate this product to cyclotomic polynomials. Cyclotomic polynomials have roots that are primitive roots of unity, and they factor into minimal polynomials over the integers.\n\nThe cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6_n(x) is the product of (x - \u03c9^k) where \u03c9 is a primitive n-th root of unity. But in our case, the product is over terms that are not linear in \u03c9^k. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the product is over all k from 0 to 12, which includes \u03c9^0 = 1 as well. So, let's see, when k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1, so the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So, the first term is 1, which is fine. For k=1 to 12, we have \u03c9^k being primitive 13th roots.\n\nWait, maybe we can express the product as a product over all x = \u03c9^k, which are the 13th roots of unity, so the product would be the product over all x where x^13 = 1 of (2 - 2x + x^2). So, the product is \u220f_{x^13=1} (x^2 - 2x + 2). Hmm, that might be a useful way to think about it.\n\nBut how do I compute such a product? I remember that the product of a polynomial evaluated at all roots of unity can sometimes be related to the resultant or something like that. Alternatively, if I have a polynomial f(x), then \u220f_{x^n=1} f(x) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^n - 1, or maybe the product of f(x) over all n-th roots of unity.\n\nWait, more specifically, if f(x) is a polynomial, then \u220f_{k=0}^{n-1} f(\u03c9^k) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^n - 1, or perhaps the value of the resultant of f and x^n - 1. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product of f(\u03c9^k) over all k is equal to the constant term of the polynomial if f(x) is monic, but I'm not sure about that. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: since x^13 - 1 = 0 for each x = \u03c9^k, perhaps I can use the fact that x^13 = 1 for each term in the product. So, each term is (x^2 - 2x + 2), and x^13 = 1.\n\nWait, but in the product, we have all x such that x^13 = 1. So, the product is \u220f_{x^13=1} (x^2 - 2x + 2). Maybe this product can be expressed as the value of some resultant or perhaps using properties of polynomials.\n\nLet me consider f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Then the product we need is \u220f_{x^13=1} f(x). But how can I compute this product?\n\nWait, I recall that for a polynomial f(x), the product over all n-th roots of unity of f(x) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^n - 1, which can sometimes be computed as the product of f evaluated at the roots of x^n - 1. Alternatively, perhaps using complex analysis or another method, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that the product is the same as the product of f(\u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12. But I can think of this as evaluating the resultant of f(x) and x^13 - 1. The resultant Res(f(x), x^13 - 1) is equal to the product of f(x) evaluated at each root of x^13 - 1, which is exactly our product.\n\nBut how do I compute the resultant of f(x) and x^13 -1? I think the resultant can be computed as the product of f(\u03c9^k) for each root \u03c9^k of x^13 -1. Alternatively, since f(x) is quadratic, maybe we can relate this to the roots of f(x) modulo x^13 -1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of the product as f(1) * f(\u03c9) * f(\u03c9^2) * ... * f(\u03c9^12). Since f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2, then f(1) = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1, which matches our earlier calculation for k=0.\n\nSo, the product is 1 multiplied by the product of f(\u03c9^k) for k=1 to 12. So, maybe it's easier to compute the product over k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nWait, perhaps I can write this as the product over k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Since \u03c9^k are the primitive 13th roots, maybe there's a way to relate this product to some cyclotomic polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that x^13 - 1 = (x - 1)\u03a6_{13}(x), where \u03a6_{13}(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial. So, \u03a6_{13}(x) is the minimal polynomial for \u03c9, which is (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^{12} + x^{11} + ... + x + 1.\n\nBut how does that help here? Hmm.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps consider that the product over all \u03c9^k (k=0 to 12) of (x - \u03c9^k) is x^{13} - 1. So, if I can express the product we're looking for in terms of x^{13} -1, maybe I can find a way to compute it.\n\nWait, but in our case, each term is a quadratic in \u03c9^k. So, perhaps instead, we can consider that the product over all \u03c9^k of (a - b\u03c9^k + c\u03c9^{2k}) can be expressed as some resultant or as a value of a certain polynomial evaluated at a particular point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think about the fact that if I let y = \u03c9^k, then each term is y^2 - 2y + 2, so the product is \u220f_{y^{13}=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2). So, this is the product of (y^2 - 2y + 2) for all y such that y^13 = 1.\n\nBut how can I compute this? Maybe note that the product is equal to the resultant of y^2 - 2y + 2 and y^13 - 1. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the product over all y of (y^2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the product of f(y) where f(y) = y^2 - 2y + 2.\n\nWait, another approach: Since y^13 = 1, then y^13 -1 =0, so for each y, we can write y^13 = 1. Therefore, in the product, each term is f(y) = y^2 - 2y + 2. Maybe we can find a relation between f(y) and y^13 -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express the product as f(y) evaluated at all y^13 =1, which is the same as the value of the resultant of f(y) and y^13 -1. I think the resultant can be computed as the product of f(y) over all roots y of y^13 -1, which is exactly our product.\n\nBut how do I compute this resultant? Maybe using the formula for the resultant of two polynomials. The resultant Res(f, g) of two polynomials f and g is equal to the product of f evaluated at the roots of g. So, in our case, Res(f(y), y^13 -1) is the product we're looking for.\n\nThe resultant can also be computed using the determinant of the Sylvester matrix, but that might be complicated here. Alternatively, if f and g are polynomials, then Res(f, g) = Res(g, f) if they are coprime, but I'm not sure if that helps here.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps factor y^13 -1 as (y -1)\u03a6_{13}(y), and since f(y) is quadratic, maybe we can find how f(y) relates to \u03a6_{13}(y). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe note that since f(y) = y^2 - 2y + 2, which is irreducible over the rationals because its discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, which is negative, so it doesn't factor into linear terms over Q.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think about the fact that the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the product over all y of (y^2 - 2y + 2), but only for y^13=1. So, perhaps it's the same as evaluating the product of f(y) over all y in the multiplicative group of 13th roots of unity.\n\nWait, perhaps using the fact that the product of f(y) over all y in a finite field can be computed using properties of polynomials over finite fields, but here we're in the complex numbers, but maybe similar ideas apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that the product is equal to the resultant of f(y) and y^13 -1, which can be written as the determinant of the Sylvester matrix. But that seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps think about the fact that f(y) = y^2 - 2y + 2 can be rewritten as (y - 1)^2 + 1, so f(y) = (y - 1)^2 + 1. Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that f(y) = y^2 - 2y + 2 is the same as (y - 1)^2 + 1, so f(y) = (y - 1)^2 + 1. Hmm, but I don't see how that helps directly.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the product over y of (y^2 - 2y + 2). But since y^13=1, we can express higher powers of y in terms of lower powers.\n\nWait, but in this case, f(y) is quadratic, so maybe we can relate it to the minimal polynomial \u03a6_{13}(y). Let me recall that \u03a6_{13}(y) is y^{12} + y^{11} + ... + y + 1. So, any power of y higher than 12 can be reduced using y^{13}=1.\n\nBut in our case, f(y) is degree 2, so perhaps we can find a relation between f(y) and \u03a6_{13}(y). Alternatively, maybe consider that since y^13=1, we can write y^k = y^{k mod 13}.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach: Let me denote z = y -1. Then, f(y) = z^2 + 1. So, the product becomes \u220f_{y^13=1} (z^2 + 1) where z = y -1.\n\nSo, the product is \u220f_{y^13=1} ( (y -1)^2 + 1 ). That might be easier to handle. So, we can write this as \u220f_{y^13=1} ( (y -1)^2 + 1 ).\n\nBut how can I compute this product? Let me make a substitution: Let w = y - 1. Then, since y^13=1, we have (w + 1)^13 = 1. So, w is a root of (w + 1)^13 -1 =0. But I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, perhaps expand (w +1)^13 -1. It would be a polynomial in w, but maybe that's not useful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think about the product as \u220f_{y^13=1} ( (y -1)^2 + 1 ) = \u220f_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2). Hmm, which is what we started with.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that for each y, (y^2 - 2y + 2) is the same as f(y), and we can relate this to f(y) modulo y^13 -1.\n\nWait, perhaps using polynomial division. Since y^13 =1, then y^13 \u22611 mod (y^13 -1). So, perhaps f(y) can be expressed in terms of lower degree polynomials modulo y^13 -1.\n\nBut f(y) is degree 2, so it's already in lower terms. Hmm.\n\nWait, another idea: Let's consider that the product we're looking for is equal to the value of the resultant of f(y) and y^13 -1, which can be computed as the determinant of the Sylvester matrix. But the Sylvester matrix for two polynomials f and g of degrees m and n is an (m+n) x (m+n) matrix, which for f(y) = y^2 - 2y +2 (degree 2) and g(y) = y^13 -1 (degree 13) would be a 15x15 matrix. That seems really complicated, so maybe that's not the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the product over all y of (y^2 - 2y + 2) where y^13=1. But perhaps we can express this as the product of f(y) evaluated at each root of y^13=1.\n\nWait, but I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should think differently. Let's consider that the product is over all 13th roots of unity, which includes y=1. So, when y=1, f(1) = 1 -2 +2 =1. So, the product is 1 times the product over y^13=1, y\u22601 of (y^2 - 2y +2). So, that's the same as the product over y\u22601 of (y^2 - 2y +2).\n\nBut y^13=1, so y^12= y^{-1}, since y^13=1 implies y^{-1}=y^{12}.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let's consider that for each y \u22601, we have y^12 = y^{-1}, so maybe we can pair terms in the product.\n\nWait, but the product is over all y^13=1, so including y=1. But since the product is 1*(product over y\u22601). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that the product over y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y +2) is equal to the product over y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y +2) = \u220f_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y +2). \n\nWait, perhaps consider that since y^13=1, then y^2 can be expressed as y^{-11}, but I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think about the fact that the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y +2) is equal to the value of the polynomial P(y) = y^2 - 2y +2 evaluated at all roots of y^13=1, which is the same as the resultant of P(y) and y^13 -1.\n\nWait, but I'm stuck here. Maybe I can think about the product as the value of the polynomial Q(y) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (y - \u03c9^k) evaluated at y being the roots of P(y) =0. Wait, that seems complicated.\n\nWait, another idea: Let me consider that the product we're looking for is \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k +2). Let me factor this as \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k +2).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{k} -1)^2 +1. Because (\u03c9^{k} -1)^2 = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k +1, so adding 1 gives \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k +2, which is exactly our term. So, each term is (\u03c9^k -1)^2 +1.\n\nSo, the product becomes \u220f_{k=0}^{12} [ (\u03c9^k -1)^2 +1 ].\n\nHmm, that might be helpful. Let me denote z_k = \u03c9^k -1. Then, each term is z_k^2 +1. So, the product is \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k^2 +1).\n\nBut since \u03c9^k are the 13th roots of unity, z_k = \u03c9^k -1 are the points shifted by 1. So, z_k are the points \u03c9^k -1 for each k.\n\nBut how does that help? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps note that when k runs from 0 to 12, \u03c9^k runs through all 13th roots of unity, so z_k = \u03c9^k -1 runs through all points \u03c9^k -1. So, perhaps the set {z_k} are the roots of the polynomial (x +1)^13 -1 =0, since \u03c9^k = z_k +1. So, (z_k +1)^13 =1.\n\nSo, the polynomial whose roots are z_k is (x +1)^13 -1 =0. So, the roots are z_k = \u03c9^k -1 for k=0,...,12.\n\nSo, the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k^2 +1) is equal to \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k^2 +1) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ( (z_k - i)(z_k +i) ), where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nSo, this product is equal to \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k - i) * \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k +i). \n\nBut since the z_k are the roots of (x +1)^13 -1 =0, which is a polynomial of degree 13, then \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - z_k) = (x +1)^13 -1. So, if I evaluate this polynomial at x = i and x = -i, then:\n\n\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (i - z_k) = (i +1)^13 -1\nand\n\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (-i - z_k) = (-i +1)^13 -1.\n\nBut since \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k - a) = (-1)^{13} \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - z_k) = - \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - z_k) because 13 is odd.\n\nWait, let me be precise. The product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - z_k) is equal to (a +1)^13 -1, because z_k = \u03c9^k -1, so a - z_k = a - \u03c9^k +1 = (a +1) - \u03c9^k. So, the product becomes \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ( (a +1) - \u03c9^k ) = (a +1)^13 -1, because \u03c9^k are the roots of x^13 -1=0.\n\nSo, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - z_k) = (a +1)^13 -1.\n\nTherefore, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k - a) = (-1)^{13} \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - z_k) = - (a +1)^13 +1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k - a) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ( -(a - z_k) ) = (-1)^{13} \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - z_k) = - \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - z_k).\n\nBut \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - z_k) = (a +1)^13 -1, as established earlier. So, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k - a) = - [ (a +1)^13 -1 ].\n\nTherefore, going back, our product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k^2 +1) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k - i) * \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k +i) = [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k - i)] * [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k +i)].\n\nUsing the above, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k - i) = - [ (i +1)^13 -1 ], and \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k +i) = - [ (-i +1)^13 -1 ].\n\nSo, the total product is [ - ( (i +1)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (-i +1)^13 -1 ) ] = ( (i +1)^13 -1 ) * ( (-i +1)^13 -1 ).\n\nSo, now we need to compute (i +1)^13, (-i +1)^13, subtract 1 from each, and then multiply them together.\n\nFirst, let's compute (i +1)^13.\n\nWe can write i +1 in polar form. The magnitude is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2), and the angle is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, (i +1) = sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (i +1)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the angle: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i *13 * \u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) - i\u221a2/2.\n\nTherefore, (i +1)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-\u221a2/2) - i\u221a2/2 ].\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * ( - (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64 * ( - 2/2 ) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i\u221a2/2) = 64 * ( -i * (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64 * (-i * 2/2 ) = 64 * (-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, (i +1)^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, compute (-i +1)^13.\n\nFirst, write -i +1 in polar form. The magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). The angle is arctangent of (-1)/1, which is -\u03c0/4, or equivalently 7\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (-i +1) = sqrt(2) e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nThen, (-i +1)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{ -i *13 * \u03c0/4 }.\n\nAgain, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nThe angle: -13\u03c0/4. Let's compute this modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 (which is 2*2\u03c0) to get it into the 0 to 2\u03c0 range: -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4 +4\u03c0 = \u03c0 - \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) + i\u221a2/2.\n\nTherefore, (-i +1)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-\u221a2/2) + i\u221a2/2 ].\n\nCompute this:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * ( - (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64 * (-2/2) = -64.\n\nImaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (i\u221a2/2) = 64 * (i * 2/2 ) = 64i.\n\nSo, (-i +1)^13 = -64 +64i.\n\nNow, going back to our expression:\n\nProduct = [ (i +1)^13 -1 ] * [ (-i +1)^13 -1 ] = [ (-64 -64i) -1 ] * [ (-64 +64i) -1 ] = ( -65 -64i ) * ( -65 +64i ).\n\nNow, compute this product:\n\nLet me denote A = -65, B = -64i, C = -65, D = +64i.\n\nSo, (A + B)(C + D) = AC + AD + BC + BD.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nAC = (-65)*(-65) = 4225.\n\nAD = (-65)*(+64i) = -4160i.\n\nBC = (-64i)*(-65) = +4160i.\n\nBD = (-64i)*(+64i) = (-64)(64)(i^2) = (-4096)(-1) = +4096.\n\nNow, sum all terms:\n\n4225 -4160i +4160i +4096.\n\nThe imaginary parts cancel out: (-4160i +4160i) = 0.\n\nSo, 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\nTherefore, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but earlier we had:\n\nProduct = [ (i +1)^13 -1 ] * [ (-i +1)^13 -1 ] = ( -65 -64i ) * ( -65 +64i ) = 8321.\n\nSo, the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k^2 +1 ) = 8321.\n\nBut wait, earlier steps: The product we're looking for is \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k +2) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ( (\u03c9^k -1)^2 +1 ) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k^2 +1 ) = 8321.\n\nWait, but I thought the product was 8321, but let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recompute (i +1)^13 and (-i +1)^13 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n(i +1) is sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}, so raising to the 13th power:\n\n(sqrt(2))^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nAngle: 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4, as 3\u03c0 is \u03c0 more than 2\u03c0. So, the angle is 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant, so cos and sin are negative.\n\nSo, e^{i5\u03c0/4} = (-\u221a2/2) - i\u221a2/2.\n\nSo, (i +1)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-\u221a2/2) - i\u221a2/2 ].\n\nCompute 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * ( - (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64 * (-2/2) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i\u221a2/2) = 64 * (-i * (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64 * (-i * 2/2 ) = -64i.\n\nSo, (i +1)^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (-i +1) is sqrt(2) e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so raising to 13th power:\n\n(sqrt(2))^13 = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nAngle: -13 * \u03c0/4 = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0: -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4 +4\u03c0 = \u03c0 - \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i3\u03c0/4} = (-\u221a2/2) + i\u221a2/2.\n\nThus, (-i +1)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-\u221a2/2) + i\u221a2/2 ].\n\nCompute 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = -64.\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (i\u221a2/2) = 64 * (i * 2/2 ) = 64i.\n\nSo, (-i +1)^13 = -64 +64i.\n\nSo, [ (i +1)^13 -1 ] = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\n[ (-i +1)^13 -1 ] = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nNow, multiply (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i):\n\nUse (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nHere, a = -65, b = 64i.\n\nSo, (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * i^2 ) = 4225 - (4096 * (-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. \n\nTherefore, the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = 8321.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000. Let's compute 8321 mod 1000.\n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because 1000 *8=8000, 8321-8000=321, yes.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake earlier. Did I compute the product correctly?\n\nYes, I think so. Let me recap:\n\nWe started with the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nWe rewrote each term as (\u03c9^k -1)^2 +1, then set z_k = \u03c9^k -1, so each term is z_k^2 +1.\n\nThen, the product becomes \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k^2 +1) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k - i)(z_k +i).\n\nThen, since z_k are the roots of (x +1)^13 -1 =0, we evaluated the product as [ (i +1)^13 -1 ] * [ (-i +1)^13 -1 ].\n\nAfter computing, we found this product to be 8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 321.\n",

      "full_content": "Alright, so I have this problem: I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and \u03c9 \u2260 1. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity because \u03c9 \u2260 1. That means \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k \u2260 1 for any k from 1 to 12. So, \u03c9^k cycles through all the 13th roots of unity except 1 as k goes from 0 to 12.\n\nThe product is over k=0 to 12, so that's all the 13th roots of unity. Each term in the product is (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor or simplify it somehow.\n\nLet me write the term as 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let's see if I can factor this expression. Maybe factor out a 2 from the first two terms: 2(1 - \u03c9^k) + \u03c9^{2k}. Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of it as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let's let x = \u03c9^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. So, x^2 - 2x + 2. Hmm, can this quadratic be factored? Let me check the discriminant: (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. Since the discriminant is negative, it doesn't factor over the reals, but maybe over complex numbers. But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Since \u03c9 is a root of unity, perhaps we can relate this product to cyclotomic polynomials. Cyclotomic polynomials have roots that are primitive roots of unity, and they factor into minimal polynomials over the integers.\n\nThe cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6_n(x) is the product of (x - \u03c9^k) where \u03c9 is a primitive n-th root of unity. But in our case, the product is over terms that are not linear in \u03c9^k. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the product is over all k from 0 to 12, which includes \u03c9^0 = 1 as well. So, let's see, when k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1, so the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So, the first term is 1, which is fine. For k=1 to 12, we have \u03c9^k being primitive 13th roots.\n\nWait, maybe we can express the product as a product over all x = \u03c9^k, which are the 13th roots of unity, so the product would be the product over all x where x^13 = 1 of (2 - 2x + x^2). So, the product is \u220f_{x^13=1} (x^2 - 2x + 2). Hmm, that might be a useful way to think about it.\n\nBut how do I compute such a product? I remember that the product of a polynomial evaluated at all roots of unity can sometimes be related to the resultant or something like that. Alternatively, if I have a polynomial f(x), then \u220f_{x^n=1} f(x) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^n - 1, or maybe the product of f(x) over all n-th roots of unity.\n\nWait, more specifically, if f(x) is a polynomial, then \u220f_{k=0}^{n-1} f(\u03c9^k) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^n - 1, or perhaps the value of the resultant of f and x^n - 1. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product of f(\u03c9^k) over all k is equal to the constant term of the polynomial if f(x) is monic, but I'm not sure about that. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: since x^13 - 1 = 0 for each x = \u03c9^k, perhaps I can use the fact that x^13 = 1 for each term in the product. So, each term is (x^2 - 2x + 2), and x^13 = 1.\n\nWait, but in the product, we have all x such that x^13 = 1. So, the product is \u220f_{x^13=1} (x^2 - 2x + 2). Maybe this product can be expressed as the value of some resultant or perhaps using properties of polynomials.\n\nLet me consider f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Then the product we need is \u220f_{x^13=1} f(x). But how can I compute this product?\n\nWait, I recall that for a polynomial f(x), the product over all n-th roots of unity of f(x) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^n - 1, which can sometimes be computed as the product of f evaluated at the roots of x^n - 1. Alternatively, perhaps using complex analysis or another method, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that the product is the same as the product of f(\u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12. But I can think of this as evaluating the resultant of f(x) and x^13 - 1. The resultant Res(f(x), x^13 - 1) is equal to the product of f(x) evaluated at each root of x^13 - 1, which is exactly our product.\n\nBut how do I compute the resultant of f(x) and x^13 -1? I think the resultant can be computed as the product of f(\u03c9^k) for each root \u03c9^k of x^13 -1. Alternatively, since f(x) is quadratic, maybe we can relate this to the roots of f(x) modulo x^13 -1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of the product as f(1) * f(\u03c9) * f(\u03c9^2) * ... * f(\u03c9^12). Since f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2, then f(1) = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1, which matches our earlier calculation for k=0.\n\nSo, the product is 1 multiplied by the product of f(\u03c9^k) for k=1 to 12. So, maybe it's easier to compute the product over k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nWait, perhaps I can write this as the product over k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Since \u03c9^k are the primitive 13th roots, maybe there's a way to relate this product to some cyclotomic polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that x^13 - 1 = (x - 1)\u03a6_{13}(x), where \u03a6_{13}(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial. So, \u03a6_{13}(x) is the minimal polynomial for \u03c9, which is (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^{12} + x^{11} + ... + x + 1.\n\nBut how does that help here? Hmm.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps consider that the product over all \u03c9^k (k=0 to 12) of (x - \u03c9^k) is x^{13} - 1. So, if I can express the product we're looking for in terms of x^{13} -1, maybe I can find a way to compute it.\n\nWait, but in our case, each term is a quadratic in \u03c9^k. So, perhaps instead, we can consider that the product over all \u03c9^k of (a - b\u03c9^k + c\u03c9^{2k}) can be expressed as some resultant or as a value of a certain polynomial evaluated at a particular point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think about the fact that if I let y = \u03c9^k, then each term is y^2 - 2y + 2, so the product is \u220f_{y^{13}=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2). So, this is the product of (y^2 - 2y + 2) for all y such that y^13 = 1.\n\nBut how can I compute this? Maybe note that the product is equal to the resultant of y^2 - 2y + 2 and y^13 - 1. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the product over all y of (y^2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the product of f(y) where f(y) = y^2 - 2y + 2.\n\nWait, another approach: Since y^13 = 1, then y^13 -1 =0, so for each y, we can write y^13 = 1. Therefore, in the product, each term is f(y) = y^2 - 2y + 2. Maybe we can find a relation between f(y) and y^13 -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express the product as f(y) evaluated at all y^13 =1, which is the same as the value of the resultant of f(y) and y^13 -1. I think the resultant can be computed as the product of f(y) over all roots y of y^13 -1, which is exactly our product.\n\nBut how do I compute this resultant? Maybe using the formula for the resultant of two polynomials. The resultant Res(f, g) of two polynomials f and g is equal to the product of f evaluated at the roots of g. So, in our case, Res(f(y), y^13 -1) is the product we're looking for.\n\nThe resultant can also be computed using the determinant of the Sylvester matrix, but that might be complicated here. Alternatively, if f and g are polynomials, then Res(f, g) = Res(g, f) if they are coprime, but I'm not sure if that helps here.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps factor y^13 -1 as (y -1)\u03a6_{13}(y), and since f(y) is quadratic, maybe we can find how f(y) relates to \u03a6_{13}(y). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe note that since f(y) = y^2 - 2y + 2, which is irreducible over the rationals because its discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, which is negative, so it doesn't factor into linear terms over Q.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think about the fact that the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the product over all y of (y^2 - 2y + 2), but only for y^13=1. So, perhaps it's the same as evaluating the product of f(y) over all y in the multiplicative group of 13th roots of unity.\n\nWait, perhaps using the fact that the product of f(y) over all y in a finite field can be computed using properties of polynomials over finite fields, but here we're in the complex numbers, but maybe similar ideas apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that the product is equal to the resultant of f(y) and y^13 -1, which can be written as the determinant of the Sylvester matrix. But that seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps think about the fact that f(y) = y^2 - 2y + 2 can be rewritten as (y - 1)^2 + 1, so f(y) = (y - 1)^2 + 1. Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that f(y) = y^2 - 2y + 2 is the same as (y - 1)^2 + 1, so f(y) = (y - 1)^2 + 1. Hmm, but I don't see how that helps directly.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the product over y of (y^2 - 2y + 2). But since y^13=1, we can express higher powers of y in terms of lower powers.\n\nWait, but in this case, f(y) is quadratic, so maybe we can relate it to the minimal polynomial \u03a6_{13}(y). Let me recall that \u03a6_{13}(y) is y^{12} + y^{11} + ... + y + 1. So, any power of y higher than 12 can be reduced using y^{13}=1.\n\nBut in our case, f(y) is degree 2, so perhaps we can find a relation between f(y) and \u03a6_{13}(y). Alternatively, maybe consider that since y^13=1, we can write y^k = y^{k mod 13}.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach: Let me denote z = y -1. Then, f(y) = z^2 + 1. So, the product becomes \u220f_{y^13=1} (z^2 + 1) where z = y -1.\n\nSo, the product is \u220f_{y^13=1} ( (y -1)^2 + 1 ). That might be easier to handle. So, we can write this as \u220f_{y^13=1} ( (y -1)^2 + 1 ).\n\nBut how can I compute this product? Let me make a substitution: Let w = y - 1. Then, since y^13=1, we have (w + 1)^13 = 1. So, w is a root of (w + 1)^13 -1 =0. But I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, perhaps expand (w +1)^13 -1. It would be a polynomial in w, but maybe that's not useful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think about the product as \u220f_{y^13=1} ( (y -1)^2 + 1 ) = \u220f_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2). Hmm, which is what we started with.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that for each y, (y^2 - 2y + 2) is the same as f(y), and we can relate this to f(y) modulo y^13 -1.\n\nWait, perhaps using polynomial division. Since y^13 =1, then y^13 \u22611 mod (y^13 -1). So, perhaps f(y) can be expressed in terms of lower degree polynomials modulo y^13 -1.\n\nBut f(y) is degree 2, so it's already in lower terms. Hmm.\n\nWait, another idea: Let's consider that the product we're looking for is equal to the value of the resultant of f(y) and y^13 -1, which can be computed as the determinant of the Sylvester matrix. But the Sylvester matrix for two polynomials f and g of degrees m and n is an (m+n) x (m+n) matrix, which for f(y) = y^2 - 2y +2 (degree 2) and g(y) = y^13 -1 (degree 13) would be a 15x15 matrix. That seems really complicated, so maybe that's not the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the product over all y of (y^2 - 2y + 2) where y^13=1. But perhaps we can express this as the product of f(y) evaluated at each root of y^13=1.\n\nWait, but I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should think differently. Let's consider that the product is over all 13th roots of unity, which includes y=1. So, when y=1, f(1) = 1 -2 +2 =1. So, the product is 1 times the product over y^13=1, y\u22601 of (y^2 - 2y +2). So, that's the same as the product over y\u22601 of (y^2 - 2y +2).\n\nBut y^13=1, so y^12= y^{-1}, since y^13=1 implies y^{-1}=y^{12}.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let's consider that for each y \u22601, we have y^12 = y^{-1}, so maybe we can pair terms in the product.\n\nWait, but the product is over all y^13=1, so including y=1. But since the product is 1*(product over y\u22601). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that the product over y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y +2) is equal to the product over y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y +2) = \u220f_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y +2). \n\nWait, perhaps consider that since y^13=1, then y^2 can be expressed as y^{-11}, but I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think about the fact that the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y +2) is equal to the value of the polynomial P(y) = y^2 - 2y +2 evaluated at all roots of y^13=1, which is the same as the resultant of P(y) and y^13 -1.\n\nWait, but I'm stuck here. Maybe I can think about the product as the value of the polynomial Q(y) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (y - \u03c9^k) evaluated at y being the roots of P(y) =0. Wait, that seems complicated.\n\nWait, another idea: Let me consider that the product we're looking for is \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k +2). Let me factor this as \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k +2).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{k} -1)^2 +1. Because (\u03c9^{k} -1)^2 = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k +1, so adding 1 gives \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k +2, which is exactly our term. So, each term is (\u03c9^k -1)^2 +1.\n\nSo, the product becomes \u220f_{k=0}^{12} [ (\u03c9^k -1)^2 +1 ].\n\nHmm, that might be helpful. Let me denote z_k = \u03c9^k -1. Then, each term is z_k^2 +1. So, the product is \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k^2 +1).\n\nBut since \u03c9^k are the 13th roots of unity, z_k = \u03c9^k -1 are the points shifted by 1. So, z_k are the points \u03c9^k -1 for each k.\n\nBut how does that help? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps note that when k runs from 0 to 12, \u03c9^k runs through all 13th roots of unity, so z_k = \u03c9^k -1 runs through all points \u03c9^k -1. So, perhaps the set {z_k} are the roots of the polynomial (x +1)^13 -1 =0, since \u03c9^k = z_k +1. So, (z_k +1)^13 =1.\n\nSo, the polynomial whose roots are z_k is (x +1)^13 -1 =0. So, the roots are z_k = \u03c9^k -1 for k=0,...,12.\n\nSo, the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k^2 +1) is equal to \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k^2 +1) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ( (z_k - i)(z_k +i) ), where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nSo, this product is equal to \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k - i) * \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k +i). \n\nBut since the z_k are the roots of (x +1)^13 -1 =0, which is a polynomial of degree 13, then \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - z_k) = (x +1)^13 -1. So, if I evaluate this polynomial at x = i and x = -i, then:\n\n\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (i - z_k) = (i +1)^13 -1\nand\n\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (-i - z_k) = (-i +1)^13 -1.\n\nBut since \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k - a) = (-1)^{13} \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - z_k) = - \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - z_k) because 13 is odd.\n\nWait, let me be precise. The product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - z_k) is equal to (a +1)^13 -1, because z_k = \u03c9^k -1, so a - z_k = a - \u03c9^k +1 = (a +1) - \u03c9^k. So, the product becomes \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ( (a +1) - \u03c9^k ) = (a +1)^13 -1, because \u03c9^k are the roots of x^13 -1=0.\n\nSo, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - z_k) = (a +1)^13 -1.\n\nTherefore, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k - a) = (-1)^{13} \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - z_k) = - (a +1)^13 +1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k - a) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ( -(a - z_k) ) = (-1)^{13} \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - z_k) = - \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - z_k).\n\nBut \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - z_k) = (a +1)^13 -1, as established earlier. So, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k - a) = - [ (a +1)^13 -1 ].\n\nTherefore, going back, our product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k^2 +1) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k - i) * \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k +i) = [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k - i)] * [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k +i)].\n\nUsing the above, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k - i) = - [ (i +1)^13 -1 ], and \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k +i) = - [ (-i +1)^13 -1 ].\n\nSo, the total product is [ - ( (i +1)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (-i +1)^13 -1 ) ] = ( (i +1)^13 -1 ) * ( (-i +1)^13 -1 ).\n\nSo, now we need to compute (i +1)^13, (-i +1)^13, subtract 1 from each, and then multiply them together.\n\nFirst, let's compute (i +1)^13.\n\nWe can write i +1 in polar form. The magnitude is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2), and the angle is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, (i +1) = sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (i +1)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the angle: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i *13 * \u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) - i\u221a2/2.\n\nTherefore, (i +1)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-\u221a2/2) - i\u221a2/2 ].\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * ( - (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64 * ( - 2/2 ) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i\u221a2/2) = 64 * ( -i * (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64 * (-i * 2/2 ) = 64 * (-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, (i +1)^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, compute (-i +1)^13.\n\nFirst, write -i +1 in polar form. The magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). The angle is arctangent of (-1)/1, which is -\u03c0/4, or equivalently 7\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (-i +1) = sqrt(2) e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nThen, (-i +1)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{ -i *13 * \u03c0/4 }.\n\nAgain, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nThe angle: -13\u03c0/4. Let's compute this modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 (which is 2*2\u03c0) to get it into the 0 to 2\u03c0 range: -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4 +4\u03c0 = \u03c0 - \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) + i\u221a2/2.\n\nTherefore, (-i +1)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-\u221a2/2) + i\u221a2/2 ].\n\nCompute this:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * ( - (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64 * (-2/2) = -64.\n\nImaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (i\u221a2/2) = 64 * (i * 2/2 ) = 64i.\n\nSo, (-i +1)^13 = -64 +64i.\n\nNow, going back to our expression:\n\nProduct = [ (i +1)^13 -1 ] * [ (-i +1)^13 -1 ] = [ (-64 -64i) -1 ] * [ (-64 +64i) -1 ] = ( -65 -64i ) * ( -65 +64i ).\n\nNow, compute this product:\n\nLet me denote A = -65, B = -64i, C = -65, D = +64i.\n\nSo, (A + B)(C + D) = AC + AD + BC + BD.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nAC = (-65)*(-65) = 4225.\n\nAD = (-65)*(+64i) = -4160i.\n\nBC = (-64i)*(-65) = +4160i.\n\nBD = (-64i)*(+64i) = (-64)(64)(i^2) = (-4096)(-1) = +4096.\n\nNow, sum all terms:\n\n4225 -4160i +4160i +4096.\n\nThe imaginary parts cancel out: (-4160i +4160i) = 0.\n\nSo, 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\nTherefore, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but earlier we had:\n\nProduct = [ (i +1)^13 -1 ] * [ (-i +1)^13 -1 ] = ( -65 -64i ) * ( -65 +64i ) = 8321.\n\nSo, the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k^2 +1 ) = 8321.\n\nBut wait, earlier steps: The product we're looking for is \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k +2) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ( (\u03c9^k -1)^2 +1 ) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k^2 +1 ) = 8321.\n\nWait, but I thought the product was 8321, but let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recompute (i +1)^13 and (-i +1)^13 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n(i +1) is sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}, so raising to the 13th power:\n\n(sqrt(2))^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nAngle: 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4, as 3\u03c0 is \u03c0 more than 2\u03c0. So, the angle is 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant, so cos and sin are negative.\n\nSo, e^{i5\u03c0/4} = (-\u221a2/2) - i\u221a2/2.\n\nSo, (i +1)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-\u221a2/2) - i\u221a2/2 ].\n\nCompute 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * ( - (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64 * (-2/2) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i\u221a2/2) = 64 * (-i * (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64 * (-i * 2/2 ) = -64i.\n\nSo, (i +1)^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (-i +1) is sqrt(2) e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so raising to 13th power:\n\n(sqrt(2))^13 = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nAngle: -13 * \u03c0/4 = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0: -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4 +4\u03c0 = \u03c0 - \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i3\u03c0/4} = (-\u221a2/2) + i\u221a2/2.\n\nThus, (-i +1)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-\u221a2/2) + i\u221a2/2 ].\n\nCompute 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = -64.\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (i\u221a2/2) = 64 * (i * 2/2 ) = 64i.\n\nSo, (-i +1)^13 = -64 +64i.\n\nSo, [ (i +1)^13 -1 ] = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\n[ (-i +1)^13 -1 ] = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nNow, multiply (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i):\n\nUse (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nHere, a = -65, b = 64i.\n\nSo, (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * i^2 ) = 4225 - (4096 * (-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. \n\nTherefore, the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = 8321.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000. Let's compute 8321 mod 1000.\n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because 1000 *8=8000, 8321-8000=321, yes.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake earlier. Did I compute the product correctly?\n\nYes, I think so. Let me recap:\n\nWe started with the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nWe rewrote each term as (\u03c9^k -1)^2 +1, then set z_k = \u03c9^k -1, so each term is z_k^2 +1.\n\nThen, the product becomes \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k^2 +1) = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (z_k - i)(z_k +i).\n\nThen, since z_k are the roots of (x +1)^13 -1 =0, we evaluated the product as [ (i +1)^13 -1 ] * [ (-i +1)^13 -1 ].\n\nAfter computing, we found this product to be 8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 321.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the remainder when the product \n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\n\\]\nis divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive 13th root of unity (\\(\\omega \\neq 1\\)).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Express Each Term in the Product**:\n   Each term in the product can be rewritten as:\n   \\[\n   2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k} = (\\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1\n   \\]\n   Let \\(z_k = \\omega^k - 1\\). Then, each term becomes \\(z_k^2 + 1\\).\n\n2. **Product Over All \\(k\\)**:\n   The entire product becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (z_k^2 + 1) = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (z_k - i)(z_k + i)\n   \\]\n   where \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\n3. **Polynomial Roots**:\n   The \\(z_k\\) are the roots of the polynomial \\((x + 1)^{13} - 1 = 0\\). Thus, the product can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (z_k - i) \\cdot \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (z_k + i)\n   \\]\n   Evaluating the polynomial at \\(x = i\\) and \\(x = -i\\):\n   \\[\n   \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (z_k - i) = (i + 1)^{13} - 1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (z_k + i) = (-i + 1)^{13} - 1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute \\((i + 1)^{13}\\) and \\((-i + 1)^{13}\\)**:\n   - \\(i + 1 = \\sqrt{2} e^{i\\pi/4}\\), so \\((i + 1)^{13} = 64\\sqrt{2} e^{i5\\pi/4} = -64 - 64i\\).\n   - \\(-i + 1 = \\sqrt{2} e^{-i\\pi/4}\\), so \\((-i + 1)^{13} = 64\\sqrt{2} e^{i3\\pi/4} = -64 + 64i\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Product**:\n   \\[\n   [(-64 - 64i) - 1] \\cdot [(-64 + 64i) - 1] = (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i)\n   \\]\n   Using the difference of squares:\n   \\[\n   (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 8321\n   \\]\n\n6. **Find the Remainder**:\n   The product is 8321.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, alright, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to cyclotomic polynomials. Maybe I can relate this product to some known polynomials or use properties of roots of unity to simplify the expression.\n\nLet me write down the product more clearly. It's the product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). So each term is a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Wait, maybe I can factor this quadratic expression or find a pattern.\n\nLet me consider each term: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me try to factor this. Let's treat \u03c9^k as a variable, say x. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. Hmm, let me rearrange it: x^2 - 2x + 2. Is this factorable? Let me check the discriminant: b\u00b2 - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4. So it doesn't factor over the reals, but maybe over complex numbers? But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can relate this quadratic to some known polynomial. Since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, \u03c9^13 = 1. So perhaps I can use properties of cyclotomic polynomials. The 13th cyclotomic polynomial is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1, since 13 is prime.\n\nWait, but how does that relate to the product we have? Let me think. Each term in the product is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Maybe I can express this in terms of a polynomial evaluated at \u03c9^k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the product over all k of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) as the product over all roots \u03c9^k of the polynomial x^2 - 2x + 2, but I'm not sure. Wait, actually, each term is a quadratic evaluated at x = \u03c9^k. So the product would be the product over all 13th roots of unity (excluding 1?) of (x^2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at x = \u03c9^k.\n\nWait, but \u03c9^k are all the 13th roots of unity except when k=0? No, wait, k goes from 0 to 12, so \u03c9^0 is 1, which is included. So the product includes the term when k=0. Let me compute that term separately.\n\nWhen k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1, so the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the term for k=0 is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So the product is 1 times the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nHmm, so maybe I can write the entire product as the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nNow, I need a way to compute this product. Maybe I can relate it to evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points.\n\nLet me consider the polynomial f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. The roots of this polynomial would be the solutions to x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So f(x) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nNow, the product over k=1 to 12 of f(\u03c9^k) would be the product over k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, product_{k=1}^{12} f(\u03c9^k) = product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nHmm, that looks like the product of (x - (1 + i)) and (x - (1 - i)) evaluated at all \u03c9^k for k=1 to 12.\n\nWait, that's similar to evaluating a polynomial at multiple points. Specifically, the product over k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) is equal to (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nBut in our case, instead of x, we have (1 + i) and (1 - i). So maybe the product over k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - a) is equal to \u03a6_13(a), where \u03a6_13 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial.\n\nWait, \u03a6_n(a) is the product over primitive nth roots of unity of (x - a). But in our case, we have all the 13th roots except 1, so the product over k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) is indeed \u03a6_13(x) when x is a variable, but when x is a constant, like (1 + i), then the product is \u03a6_13(1 + i).\n\nWait, but \u03a6_13(x) is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. So the product over k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6_13(x).\n\nSo, product_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nTherefore, product_{k=1}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6_13(a).\n\nSo, going back to our expression, product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = product_{k=1}^{12} (-(1 + i) - (-\u03c9^k)) = product_{k=1}^{12} (-(1 + i) - (-\u03c9^k)).\n\nWait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, since product_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + 1. So, if we plug in x = 1 + i, then product_{k=1}^{12} ( (1 + i) - \u03c9^k ) = \u03a6_13(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, product_{k=1}^{12} ( (1 - i) - \u03c9^k ) = \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, the product we're interested in is product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = product_{k=1}^{12} ( (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) ).\n\nBut notice that (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = |\u03c9^k - 1 - i|^2 if \u03c9^k is treated as a complex number. Wait, maybe that's an alternative approach, but perhaps not the easiest way.\n\nAlternatively, let's factor this as [product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) ] * [product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) ].\n\nWhich is equal to \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nSo, the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) equals \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, the original product is 1 * \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nSo, I need to compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i), then multiply them together.\n\n\u03a6_13(x) is x^12 + x^11 + x^10 + ... + x + 1. So, \u03a6_13(1 + i) is (1 + i)^12 + (1 + i)^11 + ... + (1 + i) + 1.\n\nSimilarly for \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nBut computing these directly seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute \u03a6_13(x) for x = 1 + i and x = 1 - i, and then multiply the results.\n\nAlternatively, note that \u03a6_13(x) is the minimal polynomial for primitive 13th roots of unity. So, if we can find the value of \u03a6_13(1 + i), which is a complex number, and similarly for \u03a6_13(1 - i), then multiply them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1). So, \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nWait, so \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + 1 = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / (i).\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( -i ).\n\nSo, let me compute these.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be written in polar form as sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}. So, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}: 13\u03c0/4 is the same as (3\u03c0/4) because 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, but wait, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, subtracting 2\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/4) gives 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-i * 2/2) = 64 * (-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nCompute that:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = -64.\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (i * 2/2) = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nNow, let's compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\n\u03a6_13(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (-64 - 64i) - 1 ) / (i) = (-65 - 64i) / i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ( (-64 + 64i) - 1 ) / (-i) = (-65 + 64i) / (-i).\n\nLet me compute each separately.\n\nFirst, \u03a6_13(1 + i):\n\n(-65 - 64i) / i. To simplify this, multiply numerator and denominator by -i:\n\n[ (-65 - 64i)(-i) ] / (i * -i) = [ 65i + 64i^2 ] / 1 = 65i - 64.\n\nSince i^2 = -1.\n\nSo \u03a6_13(1 + i) = -64 + 65i.\n\nSimilarly, compute \u03a6_13(1 - i):\n\n(-65 + 64i) / (-i). Multiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n[ (-65 + 64i) * i ] / ( -i * i ) = [ -65i + 64i^2 ] / 1 = -65i -64.\n\nBecause i^2 = -1, so 64i^2 = -64.\n\nSo \u03a6_13(1 - i) = -64 -65i.\n\nNow, the product \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) is (-64 + 65i)(-64 -65i).\n\nThis is of the form (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, where a = -64 and b = 65i.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me compute it step by step.\n\nMultiply (-64 + 65i) by (-64 -65i):\n\nFirst, multiply -64 * -64 = 4096.\n\nThen, -64 * (-65i) = 4160i.\n\nThen, 65i * -64 = -4160i.\n\nFinally, 65i * (-65i) = -4225i\u00b2.\n\nSo, adding all these together:\n\n4096 + 4160i -4160i -4225i\u00b2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe 4160i and -4160i cancel out. So we have 4096 -4225i\u00b2.\n\nBut i\u00b2 = -1, so this becomes 4096 -4225*(-1) = 4096 + 4225.\n\nCompute 4096 + 4225:\n\n4096 + 4000 = 8096; 8096 + 225 = 8321.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) = 8321.\n\nTherefore, the original product is 1 * 8321 = 8321.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. Because the product we computed was for k=1 to 12, so the original product is 1 * 8321, which is 8321.\n\nBut the problem says to find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nFirst, when computing (1 + i)^13, I got -64 -64i, which seems correct because (1 + i) has magnitude sqrt(2), and raising it to the 13th power gives (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64*sqrt(2), and the angle is 13*(45 degrees) = 585 degrees, which is equivalent to 585 - 360 = 225 degrees, which is in the third quadrant, so both real and imaginary parts are negative. So cos(225) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(225) = -sqrt(2)/2. So when multiplied by 64*sqrt(2), we get (-64 -64i), which seems correct.\n\nSimilarly for (1 - i)^13, it's -64 + 64i, which makes sense because it's the conjugate.\n\nThen, computing \u03a6_13(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] / i. So (1 + i)^13 is -64 -64i, subtract 1 gives -65 -64i. Divided by i, which is equivalent to multiplying by -i, giving (-65 -64i)*(-i) = 65i +64i\u00b2 = 65i -64, which is -64 +65i. That looks right.\n\nSimilarly for \u03a6_13(1 - i), we have (-65 +64i)/(-i). Multiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65i +64i\u00b2)/(-i^2) = (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.\n\nThen, multiplying (-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225)(i\u00b2) = 4096 - (-4225) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321. That seems correct.\n\nSo the product is 8321. Then, 8321 mod 1000 is 321. So the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check the steps again.\n\n1. The product is over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n2. When k=0, \u03c9^0=1, so the term is 1.\n3. For k=1 to 12, each term is (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n4. Each term is equal to \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2, which is the same as (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2, which factors as (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n5. Therefore, the product over k=1 to 12 is product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = [product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n6. Each product is \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i), respectively.\n7. \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 -1)/(x -1). So, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) / (i ) = (-65 -64i)/i = -64 +65i.\n8. Similarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i) = -64 -65i.\n9. Multiplying these two gives (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n10. So, the product is 8321, which mod 1000 is 321.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the remainder is 321.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, alright, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to cyclotomic polynomials. Maybe I can relate this product to some known polynomials or use properties of roots of unity to simplify the expression.\n\nLet me write down the product more clearly. It's the product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). So each term is a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Wait, maybe I can factor this quadratic expression or find a pattern.\n\nLet me consider each term: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me try to factor this. Let's treat \u03c9^k as a variable, say x. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. Hmm, let me rearrange it: x^2 - 2x + 2. Is this factorable? Let me check the discriminant: b\u00b2 - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4. So it doesn't factor over the reals, but maybe over complex numbers? But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can relate this quadratic to some known polynomial. Since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, \u03c9^13 = 1. So perhaps I can use properties of cyclotomic polynomials. The 13th cyclotomic polynomial is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1, since 13 is prime.\n\nWait, but how does that relate to the product we have? Let me think. Each term in the product is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Maybe I can express this in terms of a polynomial evaluated at \u03c9^k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the product over all k of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) as the product over all roots \u03c9^k of the polynomial x^2 - 2x + 2, but I'm not sure. Wait, actually, each term is a quadratic evaluated at x = \u03c9^k. So the product would be the product over all 13th roots of unity (excluding 1?) of (x^2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at x = \u03c9^k.\n\nWait, but \u03c9^k are all the 13th roots of unity except when k=0? No, wait, k goes from 0 to 12, so \u03c9^0 is 1, which is included. So the product includes the term when k=0. Let me compute that term separately.\n\nWhen k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1, so the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the term for k=0 is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So the product is 1 times the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nHmm, so maybe I can write the entire product as the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nNow, I need a way to compute this product. Maybe I can relate it to evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points.\n\nLet me consider the polynomial f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. The roots of this polynomial would be the solutions to x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So f(x) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nNow, the product over k=1 to 12 of f(\u03c9^k) would be the product over k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, product_{k=1}^{12} f(\u03c9^k) = product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nHmm, that looks like the product of (x - (1 + i)) and (x - (1 - i)) evaluated at all \u03c9^k for k=1 to 12.\n\nWait, that's similar to evaluating a polynomial at multiple points. Specifically, the product over k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) is equal to (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nBut in our case, instead of x, we have (1 + i) and (1 - i). So maybe the product over k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - a) is equal to \u03a6_13(a), where \u03a6_13 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial.\n\nWait, \u03a6_n(a) is the product over primitive nth roots of unity of (x - a). But in our case, we have all the 13th roots except 1, so the product over k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) is indeed \u03a6_13(x) when x is a variable, but when x is a constant, like (1 + i), then the product is \u03a6_13(1 + i).\n\nWait, but \u03a6_13(x) is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. So the product over k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6_13(x).\n\nSo, product_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nTherefore, product_{k=1}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6_13(a).\n\nSo, going back to our expression, product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = product_{k=1}^{12} (-(1 + i) - (-\u03c9^k)) = product_{k=1}^{12} (-(1 + i) - (-\u03c9^k)).\n\nWait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, since product_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + 1. So, if we plug in x = 1 + i, then product_{k=1}^{12} ( (1 + i) - \u03c9^k ) = \u03a6_13(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, product_{k=1}^{12} ( (1 - i) - \u03c9^k ) = \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, the product we're interested in is product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = product_{k=1}^{12} ( (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) ).\n\nBut notice that (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = |\u03c9^k - 1 - i|^2 if \u03c9^k is treated as a complex number. Wait, maybe that's an alternative approach, but perhaps not the easiest way.\n\nAlternatively, let's factor this as [product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) ] * [product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) ].\n\nWhich is equal to \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nSo, the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) equals \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, the original product is 1 * \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nSo, I need to compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i), then multiply them together.\n\n\u03a6_13(x) is x^12 + x^11 + x^10 + ... + x + 1. So, \u03a6_13(1 + i) is (1 + i)^12 + (1 + i)^11 + ... + (1 + i) + 1.\n\nSimilarly for \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nBut computing these directly seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute \u03a6_13(x) for x = 1 + i and x = 1 - i, and then multiply the results.\n\nAlternatively, note that \u03a6_13(x) is the minimal polynomial for primitive 13th roots of unity. So, if we can find the value of \u03a6_13(1 + i), which is a complex number, and similarly for \u03a6_13(1 - i), then multiply them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1). So, \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nWait, so \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + 1 = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / (i).\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( -i ).\n\nSo, let me compute these.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be written in polar form as sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}. So, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}: 13\u03c0/4 is the same as (3\u03c0/4) because 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, but wait, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, subtracting 2\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/4) gives 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-i * 2/2) = 64 * (-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nCompute that:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = -64.\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (i * 2/2) = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nNow, let's compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\n\u03a6_13(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (-64 - 64i) - 1 ) / (i) = (-65 - 64i) / i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ( (-64 + 64i) - 1 ) / (-i) = (-65 + 64i) / (-i).\n\nLet me compute each separately.\n\nFirst, \u03a6_13(1 + i):\n\n(-65 - 64i) / i. To simplify this, multiply numerator and denominator by -i:\n\n[ (-65 - 64i)(-i) ] / (i * -i) = [ 65i + 64i^2 ] / 1 = 65i - 64.\n\nSince i^2 = -1.\n\nSo \u03a6_13(1 + i) = -64 + 65i.\n\nSimilarly, compute \u03a6_13(1 - i):\n\n(-65 + 64i) / (-i). Multiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\n[ (-65 + 64i) * i ] / ( -i * i ) = [ -65i + 64i^2 ] / 1 = -65i -64.\n\nBecause i^2 = -1, so 64i^2 = -64.\n\nSo \u03a6_13(1 - i) = -64 -65i.\n\nNow, the product \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) is (-64 + 65i)(-64 -65i).\n\nThis is of the form (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, where a = -64 and b = 65i.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me compute it step by step.\n\nMultiply (-64 + 65i) by (-64 -65i):\n\nFirst, multiply -64 * -64 = 4096.\n\nThen, -64 * (-65i) = 4160i.\n\nThen, 65i * -64 = -4160i.\n\nFinally, 65i * (-65i) = -4225i\u00b2.\n\nSo, adding all these together:\n\n4096 + 4160i -4160i -4225i\u00b2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe 4160i and -4160i cancel out. So we have 4096 -4225i\u00b2.\n\nBut i\u00b2 = -1, so this becomes 4096 -4225*(-1) = 4096 + 4225.\n\nCompute 4096 + 4225:\n\n4096 + 4000 = 8096; 8096 + 225 = 8321.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) = 8321.\n\nTherefore, the original product is 1 * 8321 = 8321.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. Because the product we computed was for k=1 to 12, so the original product is 1 * 8321, which is 8321.\n\nBut the problem says to find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nFirst, when computing (1 + i)^13, I got -64 -64i, which seems correct because (1 + i) has magnitude sqrt(2), and raising it to the 13th power gives (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64*sqrt(2), and the angle is 13*(45 degrees) = 585 degrees, which is equivalent to 585 - 360 = 225 degrees, which is in the third quadrant, so both real and imaginary parts are negative. So cos(225) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(225) = -sqrt(2)/2. So when multiplied by 64*sqrt(2), we get (-64 -64i), which seems correct.\n\nSimilarly for (1 - i)^13, it's -64 + 64i, which makes sense because it's the conjugate.\n\nThen, computing \u03a6_13(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] / i. So (1 + i)^13 is -64 -64i, subtract 1 gives -65 -64i. Divided by i, which is equivalent to multiplying by -i, giving (-65 -64i)*(-i) = 65i +64i\u00b2 = 65i -64, which is -64 +65i. That looks right.\n\nSimilarly for \u03a6_13(1 - i), we have (-65 +64i)/(-i). Multiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65i +64i\u00b2)/(-i^2) = (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.\n\nThen, multiplying (-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225)(i\u00b2) = 4096 - (-4225) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321. That seems correct.\n\nSo the product is 8321. Then, 8321 mod 1000 is 321. So the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check the steps again.\n\n1. The product is over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n2. When k=0, \u03c9^0=1, so the term is 1.\n3. For k=1 to 12, each term is (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n4. Each term is equal to \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2, which is the same as (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2, which factors as (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n5. Therefore, the product over k=1 to 12 is product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = [product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n6. Each product is \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i), respectively.\n7. \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 -1)/(x -1). So, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) / (i ) = (-65 -64i)/i = -64 +65i.\n8. Similarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i) = -64 -65i.\n9. Multiplying these two gives (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n10. So, the product is 8321, which mod 1000 is 321.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the remainder is 321.\n\n\nThe problem requires finding the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) is a 13th root of unity.\n\n1. **Simplify the Product**:  \n   Each term in the product can be written as \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\), which factors into \\((\\omega^k - (1 + i))(\\omega^k - (1 - i))\\).  \n   For \\(k = 0\\), the term is 1, so the product becomes \\(1 \\times \\prod_{k=1}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 + i))(\\omega^k - (1 - i))\\).\n\n2. **Relate to Cyclotomic Polynomials**:  \n   The product \\(\\prod_{k=1}^{12} (\\omega^k - a)\\) is equal to the 13th cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at \\(a\\), denoted \\(\\Phi_{13}(a)\\).  \n   Therefore, the product is \\(\\Phi_{13}(1 + i) \\times \\Phi_{13}(1 - i)\\).\n\n3. **Compute \\(\\Phi_{13}(1 + i)\\) and \\(\\Phi_{13}(1 - i)\\)**:  \n   Using the formula \\(\\Phi_{13}(x) = \\frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1}\\),  \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{13}(1 + i) = \\frac{(1 + i)^{13} - 1}{i} = -64 + 65i,\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{13}(1 - i) = \\frac{(1 - i)^{13} - 1}{-i} = -64 - 65i.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply the Results**:  \n   \\[\n   (-64 + 65i)(-64 - 65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find the Remainder**:  \n   The remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is \\(321\\).\n\nThus, the remainder is \\(\\boxed{321}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and \u03c9 \u2260 1. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that the 13th roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^13 = 1. So, \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9 \u2260 1. That means \u03c9, \u03c9^2, ..., \u03c9^12 are all distinct roots.\n\nThe product is from k=0 to 12, so it includes all the 13th roots, including \u03c9^0 = 1. Wait, but the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, but in the product, k goes from 0 to 12, so when k=0, \u03c9^0 is 1. So, that term is (2 - 2*1 + 1^0) = (2 - 2 + 1) = 1. So, the first term is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So, maybe I can start the product from k=1 to 12 instead?\n\nBut maybe I shouldn't change the limits yet. Let me think. The product is over k=0 to 12, so I have 13 terms, each corresponding to a 13th root of unity. The term at k=0 is 1, as I saw. So the product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nHmm, okay. So, the problem reduces to calculating the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) and then finding the remainder when that product is divided by 1000.\n\nI wonder if there's a way to express this product in terms of polynomials. Maybe I can consider the expression 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} as a function of \u03c9^k. Let me let z = \u03c9^k, so then each term becomes 2 - 2z + z^2. So, the product becomes the product over z of (2 - 2z + z^2), where z ranges over all the 13th roots of unity except z=1.\n\nWait, because when k=0, z=1, but that term is 1, so the rest are z=\u03c9, \u03c9^2, ..., \u03c9^12.\n\nSo, the product is equal to the product over all 13th roots of unity z (including z=1) of (2 - 2z + z^2) divided by the term when z=1, which is (2 - 2*1 + 1^2) = 1. So, the product is equal to the product over all z of (2 - 2z + z^2).\n\nBut wait, the product over all 13th roots of unity z of (2 - 2z + z^2) is the same as evaluating the polynomial f(z) = 2 - 2z + z^2 at each 13th root of unity and taking the product. I remember that for a polynomial P(z), the product over all roots of unity of P(z) can be related to the value of P(z) evaluated at each root, but I might need a different approach.\n\nWait, another approach: the product over all z (z^13 = 1) of (2 - 2z + z^2) can be found by considering the polynomial Q(z) = product_{z^13=1} (2 - 2z + z^2). But since z^13 = 1, the product is over all roots of z^13 - 1 = 0. So, the product is equal to the resultant of z^13 - 1 and the polynomial 2 - 2z + z^2.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as evaluating the product over all 13th roots of unity of (z^2 - 2z + 2). So, if I have a polynomial P(z) = z^2 - 2z + 2, then the product over all z where z^13=1 of P(z) would be the same as the product of P(z) for each root. \n\nBut how can I compute that product? I remember that for a polynomial f(z), the product of f(z) over all roots z of another polynomial g(z) can sometimes be found using the resultant or by considering the relation between f and g. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the product over all z of (z - a) is equal to a^13 - 1, but that's for the product (z - a), not for another polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that the product over all z (z^13=1) of (z^2 - 2z + 2) is equal to the product of (z^2 - 2z + 2) as z runs through all 13th roots of unity. Let me denote this product as P.\n\nSo, P = product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nWait, but I can write this as product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Hmm, perhaps I can write this as product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2) = product_{k=0}^{12} ( (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2 ). So, each term is (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2, which is a quadratic in \u03c9^k.\n\nLet me let y = \u03c9^k. Then, each term is y^2 - 2y + 2. So, the product becomes product_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2). So, the product is the product of (y^2 - 2y + 2) for all 13th roots of unity y.\n\nI remember that the product of (y - a) over all y^13=1 is equal to (a^13 - 1). Wait, no, that's when the polynomial is (y - a). But here, the polynomial is quadratic in y. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: consider that if we have a polynomial f(y) = y^2 - 2y + 2, then the product of f(y) over all y such that y^13=1 is equal to the product of f(y) for each root of y^13=1.\n\nBut how to compute this product? Maybe I can relate this to the resultant or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the product is equal to the resultant of f(y) and y^13 - 1, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the value of the polynomial when evaluated at the 13th roots of unity. Wait, more precisely, the product is equal to the product of f(y) for each y in the roots of y^13 - 1.\n\nBut maybe I can think of this as evaluating f(y) at each root and multiplying them together. But how?\n\nAlternatively, consider that the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the product over all y of (y^2 - 2y + 2), which can be thought of as the product of f(y) for each y.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to consider that the product over all y of (y^2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the product over all y of (y - a)(y - b), where a and b are the roots of f(y). So, the product becomes product_{y^13=1} (y - a)(y - b) = product_{y^13=1} (y - a) * product_{y^13=1} (y - b).\n\nBut product_{y^13=1} (y - a) is equal to (a^13 - 1), since y^13 = 1, so plugging y = a into y^13 - 1 gives a^13 - 1. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the product of (y - a) for all y such that y^13 = 1 is equal to the value of the polynomial y^13 - 1 evaluated at y = a, but actually, no, that's not correct. Wait, the product over all roots y of (y - a) is equal to a^13 - 1 when y^13=1. Wait, no, because for each root y, (y - a) is a factor, so the product would be the resultant, which is a^13 - 1, but perhaps with a sign. Wait, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, let's consider that the product over all y^13=1 of (y - a) is equal to (a^13 - 1). Because the product of (y - a) for all y where y^13=1 is the same as evaluating the polynomial y^13 - 1 at y = a, but no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, if P(y) = y^13 - 1, then P(y) = product_{k=0}^{12} (y - \u03c9^k), so the product over k=0 to 12 of (y - \u03c9^k) = y^13 - 1.\n\nSo, if I set y = a, then product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1.\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1.\n\nTherefore, product_{k=0}^{12} (y - a) evaluated at y being each root is a^13 - 1.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have product_{k=0}^{12} (y^2 - 2y + 2) = product_{k=0}^{12} (y - a)(y - b), where a and b are the roots of y^2 - 2y + 2 = 0.\n\nSo, that product would be equal to product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a)(\u03c9^k - b) = [product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a)] * [product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - b)].\n\nFrom the earlier result, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = a^13 - 1, and similarly product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - b) = b^13 - 1.\n\nSo, the total product P is (a^13 - 1)(b^13 - 1).\n\nNow, let me find a and b. The quadratic equation is y^2 - 2y + 2 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, y = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo, a = 1 + i, b = 1 - i.\n\nSo, P = (a^13 - 1)(b^13 - 1).\n\nHmm, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract 1 from each, then multiply the results.\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^13 first. I know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the angles: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let me compute that modulo 2\u03c0. 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, so 3 * 2\u03c0 is 6\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 - 6\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 24\u03c0/4 = -11\u03c0/4. Hmm, alternatively, 13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to \u03c0/4 since 3\u03c0 is an odd multiple of \u03c0. Wait, no, 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 is 13\u03c0/4, which is more than 2\u03c0. Let me subtract 2\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/4) until I get within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant, which is equivalent to -3\u03c0/4, but perhaps I can just use 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, for the negative angle: -13\u03c0/4. Let me add multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's positive. Let's add 4\u03c0 (which is 16\u03c0/4) to -13\u03c0/4: -13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}, and e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 3\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i(sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{i * 3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i(sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i(sqrt(2)/2) ) ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (sqrt(2) * -sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i * sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-i * 2/2) = 64 * (-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i(sqrt(2)/2) ) ].\n\nAgain, compute the real part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64.\n\nImaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (i * sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * i * (2/2) = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nNow, let's compute (a^13 - 1) and (b^13 - 1):\n\na = 1 + i, so a^13 = -64 - 64i. Therefore, a^13 - 1 = (-64 - 64i) - 1 = -65 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, b = 1 - i, so b^13 = -64 + 64i. Therefore, b^13 - 1 = (-64 + 64i) - 1 = -65 + 64i.\n\nNow, the product P = (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i). Let's compute this.\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nAlternatively, compute using (a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2.\n\nHere, a = -65, b = 64i, so P = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * i^2) = 4225 - (4096 * (-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product P is 8321.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that P was the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), which includes the term when k=0, which is 1. So, the product is 8321. But let me confirm that.\n\nWait, yes, because when I set y = \u03c9^k, and the product over all y is product_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2) = 8321.\n\nSo, the product we're asked for is 8321. But wait, the original problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, but in our product, k starts from 0, which includes \u03c9^0 = 1. So, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The product is from k=0 to 12, so 13 terms, each (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nWe found that this product is 8321. So, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321, because 8321 = 8*1000 + 321.\n\nWait, let me compute 8321 mod 1000. 1000*8=8000, 8321-8000=321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in computing (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nWait, let me recompute (1 + i)^13:\n\nWe had (1 + i) = sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\n(sqrt(2))^13 = (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\n13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to \u03c0/4 in terms of angle (since adding 2\u03c0 multiples wraps around). But wait, 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so subtracting 2\u03c0 gives 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i(sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i(sqrt(2)/2) ) ].\n\nCalculating the real part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nImaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) i = 64 * (-2/2) i = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = sqrt(2)^13 e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is 5\u03c0/4 when reduced, so -13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to -5\u03c0/4, but adding 2\u03c0 gives 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i(sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i(sqrt(2)/2) ) ].\n\nReal part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64.\n\nImaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2) i = 64 * (2/2) i = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nThen, (a^13 - 1) = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (b^13 -1) = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nNow, their product: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2.\n\nWhich is 4225 - (4096)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Now, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321, because 8*1000 = 8000, and 8321 - 8000 = 321.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the earlier steps. Did I correctly compute the product as 8321? Because sometimes when dealing with roots of unity, there might be some subtleties.\n\nWait, another way to think about this: the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is equal to 8321, but I need to confirm that.\n\nWait, but earlier, I considered the product from k=0 to 12, which includes k=0, which is 1. So, the product is 8321. But wait, let me check if I included k=0 correctly.\n\nYes, because when k=0, \u03c9^0 =1, so 2 - 2*1 +1 =1, so that term is 1, and the product from k=0 to 12 is 1 * product from k=1 to 12, which is 8321.\n\nSo, the product is indeed 8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify. Perhaps I can compute the product another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product can be related to cyclotomic polynomials or something else.\n\nWait, another approach: consider that the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is equal to the product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor this as product_{k=1 to 12} (\u03c9^k -1)^2 + something. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that \u03c9^k are roots of \u03c9^13 =1, so maybe the product can be expressed in terms of the minimal polynomials or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2, which is a quadratic in \u03c9^k. So, the product over k=1 to 12 is the product over all roots except \u03c9^0=1 of (y^2 - 2y + 2), where y=\u03c9^k.\n\nWait, but earlier I considered the product over all roots, including 1, and found it to be 8321, which included the term at k=0, which was 1. So, the product from k=1 to 12 is 8321, because the term at k=0 is 1. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The product over all k=0 to 12 is 8321, which includes the term at k=0, which is 1. So, the product from k=1 to 12 is 8321, because 8321 is the product including k=0. So, that means the product we're to compute is 8321, and mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure that I didn't miscalculate the product as 8321 when it's actually different.\n\nWait, let me think about the value of 8321. 8321 divided by 13 is approximately 640.07, but I'm not sure if that's relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the product numerically for a smaller case to see if the approach is correct. For example, take a smaller root of unity, say 3rd roots, and compute the product. But maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that 8321 is correct, so the remainder is 321.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the remainder is 321.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega\\) is a 13th root of unity and \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\).\n\n1. **Understanding the Product**:  \n   The product includes terms for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 12\\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and \u03c9 \u2260 1. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that the 13th roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^13 = 1. So, \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9 \u2260 1. That means \u03c9, \u03c9^2, ..., \u03c9^12 are all distinct roots.\n\nThe product is from k=0 to 12, so it includes all the 13th roots, including \u03c9^0 = 1. Wait, but the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, but in the product, k goes from 0 to 12, so when k=0, \u03c9^0 is 1. So, that term is (2 - 2*1 + 1^0) = (2 - 2 + 1) = 1. So, the first term is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So, maybe I can start the product from k=1 to 12 instead?\n\nBut maybe I shouldn't change the limits yet. Let me think. The product is over k=0 to 12, so I have 13 terms, each corresponding to a 13th root of unity. The term at k=0 is 1, as I saw. So the product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nHmm, okay. So, the problem reduces to calculating the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) and then finding the remainder when that product is divided by 1000.\n\nI wonder if there's a way to express this product in terms of polynomials. Maybe I can consider the expression 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} as a function of \u03c9^k. Let me let z = \u03c9^k, so then each term becomes 2 - 2z + z^2. So, the product becomes the product over z of (2 - 2z + z^2), where z ranges over all the 13th roots of unity except z=1.\n\nWait, because when k=0, z=1, but that term is 1, so the rest are z=\u03c9, \u03c9^2, ..., \u03c9^12.\n\nSo, the product is equal to the product over all 13th roots of unity z (including z=1) of (2 - 2z + z^2) divided by the term when z=1, which is (2 - 2*1 + 1^2) = 1. So, the product is equal to the product over all z of (2 - 2z + z^2).\n\nBut wait, the product over all 13th roots of unity z of (2 - 2z + z^2) is the same as evaluating the polynomial f(z) = 2 - 2z + z^2 at each 13th root of unity and taking the product. I remember that for a polynomial P(z), the product over all roots of unity of P(z) can be related to the value of P(z) evaluated at each root, but I might need a different approach.\n\nWait, another approach: the product over all z (z^13 = 1) of (2 - 2z + z^2) can be found by considering the polynomial Q(z) = product_{z^13=1} (2 - 2z + z^2). But since z^13 = 1, the product is over all roots of z^13 - 1 = 0. So, the product is equal to the resultant of z^13 - 1 and the polynomial 2 - 2z + z^2.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as evaluating the product over all 13th roots of unity of (z^2 - 2z + 2). So, if I have a polynomial P(z) = z^2 - 2z + 2, then the product over all z where z^13=1 of P(z) would be the same as the product of P(z) for each root. \n\nBut how can I compute that product? I remember that for a polynomial f(z), the product of f(z) over all roots z of another polynomial g(z) can sometimes be found using the resultant or by considering the relation between f and g. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the product over all z of (z - a) is equal to a^13 - 1, but that's for the product (z - a), not for another polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that the product over all z (z^13=1) of (z^2 - 2z + 2) is equal to the product of (z^2 - 2z + 2) as z runs through all 13th roots of unity. Let me denote this product as P.\n\nSo, P = product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nWait, but I can write this as product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Hmm, perhaps I can write this as product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2) = product_{k=0}^{12} ( (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2 ). So, each term is (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2, which is a quadratic in \u03c9^k.\n\nLet me let y = \u03c9^k. Then, each term is y^2 - 2y + 2. So, the product becomes product_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2). So, the product is the product of (y^2 - 2y + 2) for all 13th roots of unity y.\n\nI remember that the product of (y - a) over all y^13=1 is equal to (a^13 - 1). Wait, no, that's when the polynomial is (y - a). But here, the polynomial is quadratic in y. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: consider that if we have a polynomial f(y) = y^2 - 2y + 2, then the product of f(y) over all y such that y^13=1 is equal to the product of f(y) for each root of y^13=1.\n\nBut how to compute this product? Maybe I can relate this to the resultant or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the product is equal to the resultant of f(y) and y^13 - 1, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the value of the polynomial when evaluated at the 13th roots of unity. Wait, more precisely, the product is equal to the product of f(y) for each y in the roots of y^13 - 1.\n\nBut maybe I can think of this as evaluating f(y) at each root and multiplying them together. But how?\n\nAlternatively, consider that the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the product over all y of (y^2 - 2y + 2), which can be thought of as the product of f(y) for each y.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to consider that the product over all y of (y^2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the product over all y of (y - a)(y - b), where a and b are the roots of f(y). So, the product becomes product_{y^13=1} (y - a)(y - b) = product_{y^13=1} (y - a) * product_{y^13=1} (y - b).\n\nBut product_{y^13=1} (y - a) is equal to (a^13 - 1), since y^13 = 1, so plugging y = a into y^13 - 1 gives a^13 - 1. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the product of (y - a) for all y such that y^13 = 1 is equal to the value of the polynomial y^13 - 1 evaluated at y = a, but actually, no, that's not correct. Wait, the product over all roots y of (y - a) is equal to a^13 - 1 when y^13=1. Wait, no, because for each root y, (y - a) is a factor, so the product would be the resultant, which is a^13 - 1, but perhaps with a sign. Wait, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, let's consider that the product over all y^13=1 of (y - a) is equal to (a^13 - 1). Because the product of (y - a) for all y where y^13=1 is the same as evaluating the polynomial y^13 - 1 at y = a, but no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, if P(y) = y^13 - 1, then P(y) = product_{k=0}^{12} (y - \u03c9^k), so the product over k=0 to 12 of (y - \u03c9^k) = y^13 - 1.\n\nSo, if I set y = a, then product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1.\n\nSo, product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1.\n\nTherefore, product_{k=0}^{12} (y - a) evaluated at y being each root is a^13 - 1.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have product_{k=0}^{12} (y^2 - 2y + 2) = product_{k=0}^{12} (y - a)(y - b), where a and b are the roots of y^2 - 2y + 2 = 0.\n\nSo, that product would be equal to product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a)(\u03c9^k - b) = [product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a)] * [product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - b)].\n\nFrom the earlier result, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = a^13 - 1, and similarly product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - b) = b^13 - 1.\n\nSo, the total product P is (a^13 - 1)(b^13 - 1).\n\nNow, let me find a and b. The quadratic equation is y^2 - 2y + 2 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, y = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo, a = 1 + i, b = 1 - i.\n\nSo, P = (a^13 - 1)(b^13 - 1).\n\nHmm, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract 1 from each, then multiply the results.\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^13 first. I know that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the angles: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let me compute that modulo 2\u03c0. 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, so 3 * 2\u03c0 is 6\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 - 6\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 24\u03c0/4 = -11\u03c0/4. Hmm, alternatively, 13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to \u03c0/4 since 3\u03c0 is an odd multiple of \u03c0. Wait, no, 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 is 13\u03c0/4, which is more than 2\u03c0. Let me subtract 2\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/4) until I get within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant, which is equivalent to -3\u03c0/4, but perhaps I can just use 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, for the negative angle: -13\u03c0/4. Let me add multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's positive. Let's add 4\u03c0 (which is 16\u03c0/4) to -13\u03c0/4: -13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}, and e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 3\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i(sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{i * 3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i(sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i(sqrt(2)/2) ) ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (sqrt(2) * -sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i * sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-i * 2/2) = 64 * (-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i(sqrt(2)/2) ) ].\n\nAgain, compute the real part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64.\n\nImaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (i * sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * i * (2/2) = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nNow, let's compute (a^13 - 1) and (b^13 - 1):\n\na = 1 + i, so a^13 = -64 - 64i. Therefore, a^13 - 1 = (-64 - 64i) - 1 = -65 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, b = 1 - i, so b^13 = -64 + 64i. Therefore, b^13 - 1 = (-64 + 64i) - 1 = -65 + 64i.\n\nNow, the product P = (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i). Let's compute this.\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nAlternatively, compute using (a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2.\n\nHere, a = -65, b = 64i, so P = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * i^2) = 4225 - (4096 * (-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product P is 8321.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that P was the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), which includes the term when k=0, which is 1. So, the product is 8321. But let me confirm that.\n\nWait, yes, because when I set y = \u03c9^k, and the product over all y is product_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2) = 8321.\n\nSo, the product we're asked for is 8321. But wait, the original problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, but in our product, k starts from 0, which includes \u03c9^0 = 1. So, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The product is from k=0 to 12, so 13 terms, each (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nWe found that this product is 8321. So, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321, because 8321 = 8*1000 + 321.\n\nWait, let me compute 8321 mod 1000. 1000*8=8000, 8321-8000=321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in computing (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nWait, let me recompute (1 + i)^13:\n\nWe had (1 + i) = sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\n(sqrt(2))^13 = (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\n13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to \u03c0/4 in terms of angle (since adding 2\u03c0 multiples wraps around). But wait, 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so subtracting 2\u03c0 gives 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i(sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i(sqrt(2)/2) ) ].\n\nCalculating the real part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nImaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) i = 64 * (-2/2) i = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = sqrt(2)^13 e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is 5\u03c0/4 when reduced, so -13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to -5\u03c0/4, but adding 2\u03c0 gives 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i(sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i(sqrt(2)/2) ) ].\n\nReal part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64.\n\nImaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2) i = 64 * (2/2) i = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nThen, (a^13 - 1) = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (b^13 -1) = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nNow, their product: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2.\n\nWhich is 4225 - (4096)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Now, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321, because 8*1000 = 8000, and 8321 - 8000 = 321.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the earlier steps. Did I correctly compute the product as 8321? Because sometimes when dealing with roots of unity, there might be some subtleties.\n\nWait, another way to think about this: the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is equal to 8321, but I need to confirm that.\n\nWait, but earlier, I considered the product from k=0 to 12, which includes k=0, which is 1. So, the product is 8321. But wait, let me check if I included k=0 correctly.\n\nYes, because when k=0, \u03c9^0 =1, so 2 - 2*1 +1 =1, so that term is 1, and the product from k=0 to 12 is 1 * product from k=1 to 12, which is 8321.\n\nSo, the product is indeed 8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify. Perhaps I can compute the product another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product can be related to cyclotomic polynomials or something else.\n\nWait, another approach: consider that the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is equal to the product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor this as product_{k=1 to 12} (\u03c9^k -1)^2 + something. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that \u03c9^k are roots of \u03c9^13 =1, so maybe the product can be expressed in terms of the minimal polynomials or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2, which is a quadratic in \u03c9^k. So, the product over k=1 to 12 is the product over all roots except \u03c9^0=1 of (y^2 - 2y + 2), where y=\u03c9^k.\n\nWait, but earlier I considered the product over all roots, including 1, and found it to be 8321, which included the term at k=0, which was 1. So, the product from k=1 to 12 is 8321, because the term at k=0 is 1. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The product over all k=0 to 12 is 8321, which includes the term at k=0, which is 1. So, the product from k=1 to 12 is 8321, because 8321 is the product including k=0. So, that means the product we're to compute is 8321, and mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure that I didn't miscalculate the product as 8321 when it's actually different.\n\nWait, let me think about the value of 8321. 8321 divided by 13 is approximately 640.07, but I'm not sure if that's relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the product numerically for a smaller case to see if the approach is correct. For example, take a smaller root of unity, say 3rd roots, and compute the product. But maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that 8321 is correct, so the remainder is 321.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the remainder is 321.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega\\) is a 13th root of unity and \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\).\n\n1. **Understanding the Product**:  \n   The product includes terms for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 12\\). When \\(k = 0\\), the term is \\(2 - 2\\omega^0 + \\omega^{0} = 1\\), which doesn't affect the product. Thus, we focus on the product from \\(k = 1\\) to \\(k = 12\\).\n\n2. **Expressing in Terms of Roots of Unity**:  \n   Let \\(y = \\omega^k\\). Each term becomes \\(y^2 - 2y + 2\\). The product is \\(\\prod_{y^{13}=1, y \\neq 1} (y^2 - 2y + 2)\\).\n\n3. **Quadratic Roots**:  \n   The quadratic \\(y^2 - 2y + 2 = 0\\) has roots \\(a = 1 + i\\) and \\(b = 1 - i\\).\n\n4. **Product Over All 13th Roots**:  \n   The product \\(\\prod_{y^{13}=1} (y - a)(y - b)\\) can be computed as \\((a^{13} - 1)(b^{13} - 1)\\).\n\n5. **Calculating \\(a^{13}\\) and \\(b^{13}\\)**:  \n   Using polar forms, \\(a = \\sqrt{2}e^{i\\pi/4}\\) and \\(b = \\sqrt{2}e^{-i\\pi/4}\\).  \n   \\[\n   a^{13} = (\\sqrt{2})^{13}e^{i \\cdot 13\\pi/4} = 64\\sqrt{2}e^{i \\cdot 5\\pi/4} = -64 - 64i\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   b^{13} = (\\sqrt{2})^{13}e^{-i \\cdot 13\\pi/4} = 64\\sqrt{2}e^{i \\cdot 3\\pi/4} = -64 + 64i\n   \\]\n\n6. **Computing the Product**:  \n   \\[\n   (a^{13} - 1)(b^{13} - 1) = (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321\n   \\]\n\n7. **Finding the Remainder**:  \n   The remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is \\(8321 \\mod 1000 = 321\\).\n\nThus, the remainder is \\(\\boxed{321}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, \u03c9^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial over the rationals is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.\n\nThe product given is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let's write that out as \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nWait, I notice that each term is of the form 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or relate it to a polynomial evaluated at \u03c9^k.\n\nLet me consider a substitution. Let me set x = \u03c9^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2x + x\u00b2. So, the term is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nHmm, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 can be written as (x - 1)^2 + 1, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can factor it as a quadratic in x.\n\nThe quadratic equation x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0 has roots at x = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)]/2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, the roots are complex numbers 1+i and 1-i.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, each term in the product is (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)) where x = \u03c9^k.\n\nTherefore, the entire product becomes the product over k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich can be written as [Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nSo, each of these products is the product of (\u03c9^k - a) for k from 0 to 12, where a is 1 + i or 1 - i.\n\nI remember that the product over all (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1, because the roots of x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1 are exactly the 13th roots of unity. So, if I plug in x = a, the product becomes a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have (\u03c9^k - a), which is -(a - \u03c9^k). So, the product over (\u03c9^k - a) is (-1)^13 times the product over (a - \u03c9^k) which is (-1)^13*(a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1).\n\nSince 13 is odd, (-1)^13 = -1. So, Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1).\n\nTherefore, for a = 1 + i, Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [(1 + i)^13 - 1]. Similarly, for a = 1 - i, it's - [(1 - i)^13 - 1].\n\nSo, the entire product is [ - ((1 + i)^13 - 1) ] * [ - ((1 - i)^13 - 1) ].\n\nWhich simplifies to [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nWait, no: because each product is - (a^13 - 1), so when I multiply two negatives, it becomes positive: (- (a^13 -1 )) * (- (b^13 -1 )) = (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1). So, the entire product is ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ).\n\nSo, now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI remember that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13.\n\nsqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i *13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i *13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents. 13 * \u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is the same as \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0, because 3\u03c0 = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to \u03c0/4 + \u03c0, which is 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than a full circle (2\u03c0). So, 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, it's the same as 5\u03c0/4 in standard position. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) is 2. So, 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-i * 2/2) = 64 * (-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i *5\u03c0/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nAgain, compute this:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = -64.\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (i * 2/2) = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\n(1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, let's compute ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) and ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13 - 1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product is (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i).\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to (-65)^2 + (64)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(-65)^2 = 4225.\n\n64^2 = 4096.\n\nSo, 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nTherefore, the entire product is 8321.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me go back to the product expression.\n\nEarlier, I had the product as [Product (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})] = [ ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ].\n\nBut wait, actually, I think I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no. Let me recap:\n\nThe product over (\u03c9^k - a) is equal to -(a^13 -1 ). So, the product over (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) is -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ), and similarly for (1 - i). So, when I multiply them together, it's [ - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ] = ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ). So, that part is correct.\n\nThen I computed (1 + i)^13 as -64 -64i, and (1 - i)^13 as -64 +64i. Then, subtracting 1 from each gives -65 -64i and -65 +64i.\n\nMultiplying these gives (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. So, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me confirm.\n\nWait, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321. So yes, the remainder is 321.\n\nBut hold on, I think I might have missed a negative sign somewhere. Let me double-check the steps.\n\nWait, when I computed (1 + i)^13, I got -64 -64i. So, (1 + i)^13 -1 is -65 -64i. Similarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 is -65 +64i. So, their product is (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i).\n\nWhich is (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, yes, the product is 8321, so 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier step when I wrote the product as ( (1 + i)^13 -1 )*( (1 - i)^13 -1 ). Let me check the substitution again.\n\nI had Product_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Which is equal to Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2. Which is the same as Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, the product is Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich can be written as [Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nEach product is equal to -( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) and -( (1 - i)^13 -1 ), respectively. So, when I multiply them, it's (-1)*(-1) * [ ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ] = 1 * [ ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ].\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nWait, but when I compute (1 + i)^13, I got -64 -64i. Let me double-check that calculation.\n\n1 + i is sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}. So, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\n(sqrt(2))^13 is 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2). So, that's correct.\n\ne^{i *13\u03c0/4} is e^{i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i*2\u03c0} * e^{i*\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * 1 * (-1) = -e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nWait, that might be another way to compute it. 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0. So, it's equivalent to \u03c0/4 in the negative direction, but since 3\u03c0 is \u03c0 more than 2\u03c0, which is the same as \u03c0.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: 13\u03c0/4 is the same as 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 beyond \u03c0. So, in the complex plane, that's the direction of 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant.\n\nSo, e^{i*5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i*5\u03c0/4} = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nMultiply 64*sqrt(2) with (-sqrt(2)/2):\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (2)/2 ) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64*sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-i)*(2)/2 = 64*(-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, yes, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64 +64i.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSubtracting 1 gives (-65 -64i) and (-65 +64i). Multiplying these together:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(i^2). But i^2 is -1, so this becomes 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, yes, the product is 8321. So, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but hold on. Is that the final answer? Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, but 8321 is the product. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321. So, the answer is 321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the entire process again to make sure.\n\n1. The given product is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\n2. Each term is (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2.\n\n3. Let x = \u03c9^k, then each term is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\n4. So, the entire product is Product_{k=0}^{12} (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)) where x = \u03c9^k.\n\n5. So, it's [Product (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [Product (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\n6. Each product is -( (1 \u00b1 i)^13 -1 ).\n\n7. So, the total product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ] = [ ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ].\n\n8. Calculated (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i, so (1 + i)^13 -1 = -65 -64i.\n\n9. Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64 +64i, so (1 - i)^13 -1 = -65 +64i.\n\n10.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, \u03c9^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial over the rationals is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.\n\nThe product given is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let's write that out as \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nWait, I notice that each term is of the form 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or relate it to a polynomial evaluated at \u03c9^k.\n\nLet me consider a substitution. Let me set x = \u03c9^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2x + x\u00b2. So, the term is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nHmm, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 can be written as (x - 1)^2 + 1, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can factor it as a quadratic in x.\n\nThe quadratic equation x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0 has roots at x = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)]/2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, the roots are complex numbers 1+i and 1-i.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, each term in the product is (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)) where x = \u03c9^k.\n\nTherefore, the entire product becomes the product over k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich can be written as [Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nSo, each of these products is the product of (\u03c9^k - a) for k from 0 to 12, where a is 1 + i or 1 - i.\n\nI remember that the product over all (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1, because the roots of x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1 are exactly the 13th roots of unity. So, if I plug in x = a, the product becomes a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have (\u03c9^k - a), which is -(a - \u03c9^k). So, the product over (\u03c9^k - a) is (-1)^13 times the product over (a - \u03c9^k) which is (-1)^13*(a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1).\n\nSince 13 is odd, (-1)^13 = -1. So, Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1).\n\nTherefore, for a = 1 + i, Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = - [(1 + i)^13 - 1]. Similarly, for a = 1 - i, it's - [(1 - i)^13 - 1].\n\nSo, the entire product is [ - ((1 + i)^13 - 1) ] * [ - ((1 - i)^13 - 1) ].\n\nWhich simplifies to [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].\n\nWait, no: because each product is - (a^13 - 1), so when I multiply two negatives, it becomes positive: (- (a^13 -1 )) * (- (b^13 -1 )) = (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1). So, the entire product is ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ).\n\nSo, now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI remember that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13.\n\nsqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i *13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i *13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents. 13 * \u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is the same as \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0, because 3\u03c0 = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0. So, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to \u03c0/4 + \u03c0, which is 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than a full circle (2\u03c0). So, 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, it's the same as 5\u03c0/4 in standard position. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) is 2. So, 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-i * 2/2) = 64 * (-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i *5\u03c0/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nAgain, compute this:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = -64.\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (i * 2/2) = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\n(1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, let's compute ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) and ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ).\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13 - 1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product is (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i).\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to (-65)^2 + (64)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(-65)^2 = 4225.\n\n64^2 = 4096.\n\nSo, 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nTherefore, the entire product is 8321.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me go back to the product expression.\n\nEarlier, I had the product as [Product (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})] = [ ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ].\n\nBut wait, actually, I think I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no. Let me recap:\n\nThe product over (\u03c9^k - a) is equal to -(a^13 -1 ). So, the product over (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) is -( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ), and similarly for (1 - i). So, when I multiply them together, it's [ - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ] = ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ). So, that part is correct.\n\nThen I computed (1 + i)^13 as -64 -64i, and (1 - i)^13 as -64 +64i. Then, subtracting 1 from each gives -65 -64i and -65 +64i.\n\nMultiplying these gives (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. So, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me confirm.\n\nWait, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321. So yes, the remainder is 321.\n\nBut hold on, I think I might have missed a negative sign somewhere. Let me double-check the steps.\n\nWait, when I computed (1 + i)^13, I got -64 -64i. So, (1 + i)^13 -1 is -65 -64i. Similarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 is -65 +64i. So, their product is (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i).\n\nWhich is (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, yes, the product is 8321, so 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier step when I wrote the product as ( (1 + i)^13 -1 )*( (1 - i)^13 -1 ). Let me check the substitution again.\n\nI had Product_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Which is equal to Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2. Which is the same as Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, the product is Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich can be written as [Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nEach product is equal to -( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) and -( (1 - i)^13 -1 ), respectively. So, when I multiply them, it's (-1)*(-1) * [ ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ] = 1 * [ ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ].\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nWait, but when I compute (1 + i)^13, I got -64 -64i. Let me double-check that calculation.\n\n1 + i is sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}. So, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\n(sqrt(2))^13 is 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2). So, that's correct.\n\ne^{i *13\u03c0/4} is e^{i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i*2\u03c0} * e^{i*\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * 1 * (-1) = -e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nWait, that might be another way to compute it. 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0. So, it's equivalent to \u03c0/4 in the negative direction, but since 3\u03c0 is \u03c0 more than 2\u03c0, which is the same as \u03c0.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: 13\u03c0/4 is the same as 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 beyond \u03c0. So, in the complex plane, that's the direction of 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant.\n\nSo, e^{i*5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i*5\u03c0/4} = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nMultiply 64*sqrt(2) with (-sqrt(2)/2):\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (2)/2 ) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64*sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-i)*(2)/2 = 64*(-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, yes, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64 +64i.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSubtracting 1 gives (-65 -64i) and (-65 +64i). Multiplying these together:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(i^2). But i^2 is -1, so this becomes 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, yes, the product is 8321. So, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but hold on. Is that the final answer? Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, but 8321 is the product. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321. So, the answer is 321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the entire process again to make sure.\n\n1. The given product is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\n2. Each term is (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2.\n\n3. Let x = \u03c9^k, then each term is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\n4. So, the entire product is Product_{k=0}^{12} (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)) where x = \u03c9^k.\n\n5. So, it's [Product (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [Product (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\n6. Each product is -( (1 \u00b1 i)^13 -1 ).\n\n7. So, the total product is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ] = [ ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ].\n\n8. Calculated (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i, so (1 + i)^13 -1 = -65 -64i.\n\n9. Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64 +64i, so (1 - i)^13 -1 = -65 +64i.\n\n10. Multiply these to get (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\n11. 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\n\nThe problem requires finding the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) is a 13th root of unity.\n\n1. **Express each term as a quadratic**: Each term \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\) can be rewritten as \\(\\omega^{2k} - 2\\omega^k + 2\\), which factors as \\((\\omega^k - (1 + i))(\\omega^k - (1 - i))\\).\n\n2. **Express the entire product**: The product becomes \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 + i))(\\omega^k - (1 - i))\\).\n\n3. **Use properties of roots of unity**: The product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - a)\\) for any complex number \\(a\\) is \\(- (a^{13} - 1)\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation \u03c9^13 = 1, right? So, \u03c9^k for k from 0 to 12 are all the distinct 13th roots of unity. Except when k=0, \u03c9^0 is 1, but the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, so maybe k starts from 1? Wait, no, the product is from k=0 to 12, so including k=0. But when k=0, \u03c9^0 is 1, so the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1^2*1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is just 1, which doesn't affect the product. So maybe I can just consider k from 1 to 12 and multiply by 1, which is redundant. So, maybe it's easier to think about the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nBut wait, let me write out the product as it is. So, the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including 1. But as I saw, the term for k=0 is 1, so the product is the same as the product from k=1 to 12. So, that's good to note.\n\nNow, the expression inside the product is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Hmm, maybe I can factor this or find a pattern. Let me see: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} can be rewritten as \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. Hmm, does that factor into something? Let's think of it as a quadratic in \u03c9^k.\n\nSo, let me denote x = \u03c9^k. Then, the expression becomes x^2 - 2x + 2. Hmm, can this quadratic be factored? Let me check the discriminant: D = ( -2 )^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. Since the discriminant is negative, it doesn't factor over the real numbers, but maybe over complex numbers. But I don't know if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a polynomial evaluated at x = \u03c9^k. So, the product over k=1 to 12 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) where x = \u03c9^k. Wait, but since \u03c9^k are roots of x^13 - 1 = 0, except x=1. Hmm, maybe I can relate this to polynomials.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the product as the product over all x \u2260 1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2). Since x runs through all 13th roots of unity except 1. So, maybe the product is the product over x^13 = 1, x \u22601 of (x^2 - 2x + 2). \n\nI remember that for polynomials, the product over roots can be related to the value of the polynomial at certain points. So, for a polynomial f(x), the product of (x - a) where a are the roots is f(x). But here, I have a product of (x^2 - 2x + 2) for each root x. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that for x^13 - 1 = 0, so the roots are x = \u03c9^k for k=0,1,...,12. So, the product over x^13 -1 =0, x\u22601, of (x^2 - 2x + 2) would be equal to the value of some polynomial evaluated at specific points. Maybe I can relate this to the polynomial f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: perhaps I can consider that the product over all x^13 =1 (x\u22601) of (x^2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). So, that's the same as the original product.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the product as the product over k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2, which is the same as product over k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to consider the product over all x (x^13 -1) =0, x\u22601 of (x^2 - 2x + 2). So, the product is equal to the product of (x^2 - 2x + 2) for all x except x=1. So, perhaps we can relate this to evaluating the polynomial P(x) = product_{x^13=1, x\u22601} (x^2 - 2x + 2).\n\nAlternatively, another idea: since x^13 =1, so x^13 -1 =0, which factors as (x-1)(x^12 + x^11 + ... +x +1)=0. So, the product over x\u22601 of (x^2 -2x +2) is the same as the product over x of (x^2 -2x +2) divided by (x=1 term). Wait, no, because when x=1, the term is (1 - 2 +2)=1, so the product over x=1 to x=13th roots is the same as the product over x\u22601 of (x^2 -2x +2) multiplied by 1, so it's just the product over x\u22601.\n\nWait, but the product over x of (x^2 -2x +2) where x are the 13th roots of unity. Hmm, perhaps I can relate this to evaluating the resultant or something.\n\nWait, perhaps using the fact that if f(x) is a polynomial, then the product over f(\u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^13 -1. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that the product over x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x +2) is equal to the resultant of x^13 -1 and x^2 -2x +2, but I might be overcomplicating.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to note that the product over x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x +2) is equal to the product over x of (x^2 -2x +2) where x^13=1. So, that's the same as plugging x^13=1 into the product.\n\nWait, but that might not directly help. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the product as the value of the polynomial Q(x) = product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) evaluated at x= something. Wait, but that's just x^13 -1.\n\nHmm, perhaps another angle. Let me consider that for each x, x^13 =1. So, x^13 =1, which implies x^12 = x^{-1}, x^11 =x^{-2}, etc. Maybe I can express x^2 -2x +2 in terms of x^{-1}.\n\nWait, let me write x^2 -2x +2 as x^2 -2x +2 = x^2 -2x +1 +1 = (x-1)^2 +1. Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor x^2 -2x +2 as (x - a)(x - b), but as I thought earlier, it doesn't factor over real numbers because the discriminant is negative. So, the roots are complex: [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo, the roots are 1+i and 1-i. So, x^2 -2x +2 = (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)). Hmm, interesting. So, perhaps the product over x (x^13=1, x\u22601) of (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)).\n\nWait, but the product over x\u22601 of (x - a) is equal to (x^13 -1)/(x -1) evaluated at x=a. Wait, yes! Because the product over all x^13=1 of (x - a) is equal to a^13 -1, because the polynomial x^13 -1 factors as product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k). So, product_{k=0}^{12} (x - a) = x^13 -1. So, product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 -1.\n\nBut in our case, we have product_{x^13=1, x\u22601} (x - a) = (product_{x^13=1} (x -a)) / (1 - a) ) = (a^13 -1)/(1 -a). So, yeah.\n\nSo, applying that, for a =1+i, product_{x^13=1, x\u22601} (x - (1+i)) = ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) / (1 - (1+i)) = ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) / (-i).\n\nSimilarly, for a=1-i, product_{x^13=1, x\u22601} (x - (1-i)) = ( (1-i)^13 -1 ) / (1 - (1-i)) = ( (1-i)^13 -1 ) / (i).\n\nTherefore, the product over x\u22601 of (x^2 -2x +2) = product_{x\u22601} (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)) = [product_{x\u22601} (x - (1+i)) ] * [product_{x\u22601} (x - (1-i)) ] = [ ((1+i)^13 -1)/(-i) ] * [ ((1-i)^13 -1)/(i) ].\n\nSo, let's compute this. Let me denote A = (1+i)^13 -1 and B = (1-i)^13 -1.\n\nThen, the product becomes [A / (-i)] * [B / i] = [A * B] / (-i * i) = [A * B] / (-i^2) = [A * B] / (1), since i^2 = -1, so -i^2 =1.\n\nSo, the product is A*B.\n\nSo, now I need to compute A = (1+i)^13 -1 and B = (1-i)^13 -1, then multiply them together.\n\nFirst, let me compute (1+i)^13. I know that 1+i has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4. So, (1+i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1-i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -\u03c0/4, so (1-i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{-i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, let's compute (1+i)^13:\n\n(1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute 13 * \u03c0/4: 13 divided by 4 is 3 with remainder 1, so 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so e^{i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i*(\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i*5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i*(13\u03c0/4)} = e^{-i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i*(\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i*5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, let's compute (1+i)^13:\n\n(1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nCompute this: 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i) = 64*(-2)/2 i = -64i.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nCompute real part: 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64.\n\nImaginary part: 64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 i) = 64*(2)/2 i = 64i.\n\nSo, (1-i)^13 = -64 +64i.\n\nTherefore, A = (1+i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, B = (1-i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, A * B = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to |A|^2.\n\nCompute |A|^2: (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, let me compute that again: 65^2 is 4225, 64^2 is 4096. So, 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, A * B = 8321.\n\nTherefore, the product over x\u22601 of (x^2 -2x +2) is 8321.\n\nWait, so the original product is 8321. Now, the question is to find the remainder when this is divided by 1000.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, let me verify that computation again. 8321 divided by 1000: 1000*8=8000, 8321-8000=321. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 321.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing A and B.\n\nWe had (1+i)^13 = -64 -64i, so A = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 = -64 +64i, so B = -65 +64i.\n\nThen, A*B = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2. Wait, no, actually, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * i^2). Since i^2 = -1, this becomes 4225 - (4096 * (-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321, and mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321 when divided by 1000.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation \u03c9^13 = 1, right? So, \u03c9^k for k from 0 to 12 are all the distinct 13th roots of unity. Except when k=0, \u03c9^0 is 1, but the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, so maybe k starts from 1? Wait, no, the product is from k=0 to 12, so including k=0. But when k=0, \u03c9^0 is 1, so the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1^2*1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is just 1, which doesn't affect the product. So maybe I can just consider k from 1 to 12 and multiply by 1, which is redundant. So, maybe it's easier to think about the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nBut wait, let me write out the product as it is. So, the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including 1. But as I saw, the term for k=0 is 1, so the product is the same as the product from k=1 to 12. So, that's good to note.\n\nNow, the expression inside the product is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Hmm, maybe I can factor this or find a pattern. Let me see: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} can be rewritten as \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. Hmm, does that factor into something? Let's think of it as a quadratic in \u03c9^k.\n\nSo, let me denote x = \u03c9^k. Then, the expression becomes x^2 - 2x + 2. Hmm, can this quadratic be factored? Let me check the discriminant: D = ( -2 )^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. Since the discriminant is negative, it doesn't factor over the real numbers, but maybe over complex numbers. But I don't know if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a polynomial evaluated at x = \u03c9^k. So, the product over k=1 to 12 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) where x = \u03c9^k. Wait, but since \u03c9^k are roots of x^13 - 1 = 0, except x=1. Hmm, maybe I can relate this to polynomials.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the product as the product over all x \u2260 1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2). Since x runs through all 13th roots of unity except 1.

Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that for x^13 - 1 = 0, so the roots are x = \u03c9^k for k=0,1,...,12. So, the product over x^13 -1 =0, x\u22601, of (x^2 - 2x + 2) would be equal to the value of some polynomial evaluated at specific points. Maybe I can relate this to the polynomial f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: perhaps I can consider that the product over all x^13 =1 (x\u22601) of (x^2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). So, that's the same as the original product.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the product as the product over k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2, which is the same as product over k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to consider the product over all x (x^13 -1) =0, x\u22601 of (x^2 - 2x + 2). So, the product is equal to the product of (x^2 - 2x + 2) for all x except x=1. So, perhaps we can relate this to evaluating the polynomial P(x) = product_{x^13=1, x\u22601} (x^2 - 2x + 2).\n\nAlternatively, another idea: since x^13 =1, so x^13 -1 =0, which factors as (x-1)(x^12 + x^11 + ... +x +1)=0. So, the product over x\u22601 of (x^2 -2x +2) is the same as the product over x of (x^2 -2x +2) divided by (x=1 term). Wait, no, because when x=1, the term is (1 - 2 +2)=1, so the product over x=1 to x=13th roots is the same as the product over x\u22601 of (x^2 -2x +2) multiplied by 1, so it's just the product over x\u22601.\n\nWait, but the product over x of (x^2 -2x +2) where x are the 13th roots of unity.

So, that's the same as plugging x^13=1 into the product.\n\nWait, but that might not directly help. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the product as the value of the polynomial Q(x) = product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) evaluated at x= something. Wait, but that's just x^13 -1.\n\nHmm, perhaps another angle. Let me consider that for each x, x^13 =1. So, x^13 =1, which implies x^12 = x^{-1}, x^11 =x^{-2}, etc. Maybe I can express x^2 -2x +2 in terms of x^{-1}.\n\nWait, let me write x^2 -2x +2 as x^2 -2x +2 = x^2 -2x +1 +1 = (x-1)^2 +1. Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor x^2 -2x +2 as (x - a)(x - b), but as I thought earlier, it doesn't factor over real numbers because the discriminant is negative. So, the roots are complex: [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo, the roots are 1+i and 1-i. So, x^2 -2x +2 = (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)). Hmm, interesting. So, perhaps the product over x (x^13=1, x\u22601) of (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)).\n\nWait, but the product over x\u22601 of (x - a) is equal to (x^13 -1)/(x -1) evaluated at x=a. Wait, yes! Because the product over all x^13=1 of (x - a) is equal to a^13 -1, because the polynomial x^13 -1 factors as product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k). So, product_{k=0}^{12} (x - a) = x^13 -1. So, product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 -1.\n\nBut in our case, we have product_{x^13=1, x\u22601} (x - a) = (product_{x^13=1} (x -a)) / (1 - a) ) = (a^13 -1)/(1 -a). So, yeah.\n\nSo, applying that, for a =1+i, product_{x^13=1, x\u22601} (x - (1+i)) = ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) / (1 - (1+i)) = ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) / (-i).\n\nSimilarly, for a=1-i, product_{x^13=1, x\u22601} (x - (1-i)) = ( (1-i)^13 -1 ) / (1 - (1-i)) = ( (1-i)^13 -1 ) / (i).\n\nTherefore, the product over x\u22601 of (x^2 -2x +2) = product_{x\u22601} (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)) = [product_{x\u22601} (x - (1+i)) ] * [product_{x\u22601} (x - (1-i)) ] = [ ((1+i)^13 -1)/(-i) ] * [ ((1-i)^13 -1)/(i) ].\n\nSo, let's compute this. Let me denote A = (1+i)^13 -1 and B = (1-i)^13 -1.\n\nThen, the product becomes [A / (-i)] * [B / i] = [A * B] / (-i * i) = [A * B] / (-i^2) = [A * B] / (1), since i^2 = -1, so -i^2 =1.\n\nSo, the product is A*B.\n\nSo, now I need to compute A = (1+i)^13 -1 and B = (1-i)^13 -1, then multiply them together.\n\nFirst, let me compute (1+i)^13. I know that 1+i has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4. So, (1+i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1-i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -\u03c0/4, so (1-i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{-i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, let's compute (1+i)^13:\n\n(1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute 13 * \u03c0/4: 13 divided by 4 is 3 with remainder 1, so 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, so e^{i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i*(\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i*5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i*(13\u03c0/4)} = e^{-i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i*(\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i*5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, let's compute (1+i)^13:\n\n(1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nCompute this: 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i) = 64*(-2)/2 i = -64i.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nCompute real part: 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64.\n\nImaginary part: 64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 i) = 64*(2)/2 i = 64i.\n\nSo, (1-i)^13 = -64 +64i.\n\nTherefore, A = (1+i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, B = (1-i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, A * B = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to |A|^2.\n\nCompute |A|^2: (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, let me compute that again: 65^2 is 4225, 64^2 is 4096. So, 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, A * B = 8321.\n\nTherefore, the product over x\u22601 of (x^2 -2x +2) is 8321.\n\nWait, so the original product is 8321. Now, the question is to find the remainder when this is divided by 1000.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, let me verify that computation again. 8321 divided by 1000: 1000*8=8000, 8321-8000=321. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 321.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing A and B.\n\nWe had (1+i)^13 = -64 -64i, so A = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 = -64 +64i, so B = -65 +64i.\n\nThen, A*B = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2. Wait, no, actually, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * i^2). Since i^2 = -1, this becomes 4225 - (4096 * (-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321, and mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321 when divided by 1000.\n\n\nThe given problem involves finding the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega\\) is a 13th root of unity (\\(\\omega \\neq 1\\)).\n\nFirst, note that \\(\\omega^{13} = 1\\), and the terms \\(\\omega^k\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, \\dots, 12\\) are all distinct 13th roots of unity. The term for \\(k = 0\\) is 1, making the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) equivalent to \\(\\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\).\n\nRewriting the expression inside the product as a quadratic in \\(x = \\omega^k\\), we get \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\). The product becomes \\(\\prod_{k=1}^{12}(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\) where \\(x = \\omega^k\\).\n\nUsing properties of roots of unity, the product over all 13th roots of unity (excluding 1) of \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\) can be expressed as the product of \\((x - (1+i))(x - (1-i))\\) for all such \\(x\\). This is equivalent to evaluating the polynomials at \\(x = 1+i\\) and \\(x = 1-i\\).\n\nThe product is computed as:\n\\[\n\\prod_{x \\neq 1} (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)) = \\frac{(1+i)^{13} - 1}{1 - (1+i)} \\cdot \\frac{(1-i)^{13} - 1}{1 - (1-i)}.\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\((1+i)^{13}\\) and \\((1-i)^{13}\\) using polar forms, we find:\n\\[\n(1+i)^{13} = -64 - 64i, \\quad (1-i)^{13} = -64 + 64i.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(A = (1+i)^{13} - 1 = -65 - 64i\\) and \\(B = (1-i)^{13} - 1 = -65 + 64i\\). The product \\(A \\cdot B\\) is:\n\\[\n(-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\\]\n\nFinally, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is:\n\\[\n8321 \\mod 1000 = 321.\n\\]\n\nThus, the remainder is \\(\\boxed{321}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and \u03c9 \u2260 1. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that the 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation x^13 = 1. They can be expressed as \u03c9^k for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 12, where \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/13). Since \u03c9 \u2260 1, we're excluding k=0, which is just 1.\n\nNow, the product is over all these roots, so each term in the product is (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). That looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify each term.\n\nLet me look at one term: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Hmm, can I factor this or write it in a different way? Let's see:\n\n2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of \u03c9^k. Let me treat \u03c9^k as a variable, say x. So the term becomes x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nWait, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Let me see if this factors or if I can relate it to something else. The discriminant is b\u00b2 - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4, so it doesn't factor over the reals. But maybe in complex numbers, but perhaps it's more useful to think in terms of polynomials.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this as (x - a)(x - b), but since it doesn't factor over reals, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can relate it to cyclotomic polynomials or something else.\n\nWait, the product is over all 13th roots of unity except 1. So, each term is evaluated at \u03c9^k, for k=1 to 12, but wait, in the product, k goes from 0 to 12. But when k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1, so let me check what happens when k=0.\n\nWhen k=0, the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1^0 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nSo the entire product is equal to the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nHmm, maybe I can find a generating polynomial whose roots are these terms or relate this product to some known polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express each term as (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2) and recognize it as a value of some polynomial evaluated at \u03c9^k.\n\nLet me think about the polynomial f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Then, each term is f(\u03c9^k). So the product is the product of f(\u03c9^k) for k=1 to 12.\n\nWait, that's an interesting approach. So the product is \u220f_{k=1}^{12} f(\u03c9^k) where f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nNow, I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=1 to 12 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. Because the 13th roots of unity except 1 are primitive.\n\nBut here, we're dealing with f(\u03c9^k) = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. So, perhaps I can relate the product \u220f_{k=1}^{12} f(\u03c9^k) to the value of another polynomial evaluated at certain points.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the product of f(\u03c9^k) over all k=1 to 12 as the product of f(x) evaluated at each root of \u03a6_13(x). So, maybe using properties of polynomials and roots.\n\nWait, another approach: The product of f(\u03c9^k) over all k=1 to 12 is equal to the resultant of f(x) and \u03a6_13(x), but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product is equal to the product of f(\u03c9^k) for each root \u03c9^k of \u03a6_13(x). So, since \u03a6_13(x) is the minimal polynomial for \u03c9, then the product would be related to evaluating f(x) at each root and multiplying.\n\nWait, but f(x) is a quadratic, and \u03a6_13(x) is degree 12. Maybe if I consider the product over all roots of \u03a6_13(x) of f(x), that would be the same as the resultant or something else.\n\nWait, another idea: For a polynomial P(x) with roots \u03b1_1, \u03b1_2, ..., \u03b1_n, the product of P(\u03b2_i) for i=1 to n is equal to the resultant of P and Q, where Q is another polynomial with roots \u03b2_i. But maybe that's getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the product as \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Let me write this as \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nLet me make a substitution: Let y = \u03c9^k. Then, since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, y ranges over all the 13th roots of unity except 1 as k goes from 1 to 12.\n\nSo the product becomes \u220f_{y^13=1, y\u22601} (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2).\n\nSo now, the product is over all y such that y^13 = 1 and y \u2260 1 of (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2).\n\nHmm, that seems more manageable. So, the product is the product of (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2) for all y \u2260 1 with y^13 =1.\n\nBut wait, how can I compute this product? Maybe I can relate it to evaluating a polynomial at certain points.\n\nLet me think: The product over all y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2) would be the same as evaluating the polynomial P(y) = y\u00b2 - 2y + 2 at each 13th root of unity and taking the product. But in our case, we exclude y=1, so the product is equal to [product over all y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2)] divided by (1\u00b2 - 2*1 + 2) = (1 - 2 + 2) = 1. So, actually, our product is equal to the product over all y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2).\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. Because when y=1, the term is 1, so the product over all y^13=1 is equal to the product from k=0 to 12, which includes y=1. But since when y=1, the term is 1, then the product over all y^13=1 is equal to the product we're looking for (from k=1 to 12) multiplied by 1. So, our product is equal to the product over all y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2).\n\nSo, perhaps I can compute this product as the resultant of P(y) = y\u00b2 - 2y + 2 and Q(y) = y^13 -1. Alternatively, maybe using properties of polynomials.\n\nWait, another approach: The product over all y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the product of (y - a)(y - b), where a and b are the roots of y\u00b2 - 2y + 2 = 0. So, if a and b are the roots, then the product becomes \u220f_{y^13=1} (y - a)(y - b) = \u220f_{y^13=1} (y - a) * \u220f_{y^13=1} (y - b).\n\nBut \u220f_{y^13=1} (y - a) is equal to a^13 -1, because the product of (y - a) over all y^13=1 is equal to (a^13 -1). Because the product of (y - a) for y being all roots of y^13 -1 =0 is equal to the value of y^13 -1 evaluated at a, which is a^13 -1. Similarly for b.\n\nWait, wait, that might be the case. Let me think about that. For any polynomial Q(y) with roots y_1, y_2, ..., y_n, then the product of (y - a) over all roots y_i is equal to Q(a). Because Q(y) = \u220f_{i=1}^n (y - y_i), so Q(a) = \u220f_{i=1}^n (a - y_i) = (-1)^n \u220f_{i=1}^n (y_i - a). So, if I take the product \u220f_{i=1}^n (y_i - a), that's equal to (-1)^n Q(a).\n\nIn our case, Q(y) = y^13 -1, which has roots y=1, \u03c9, \u03c9\u00b2, ..., \u03c9^12. So, the product over all y^13=1 of (y - a) is equal to Q(a) = a^13 -1.\n\nSimilarly, the product over all y^13=1 of (y - b) is b^13 -1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the product over all y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2) is equal to (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1), where a and b are the roots of y\u00b2 -2y +2=0.\n\nSo, let's find a and b. The quadratic equation y\u00b2 -2y +2 =0 has solutions:\n\ny = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo, a = 1 + i, b = 1 - i.\n\nNow, compute a^13 and b^13.\n\nHmm, computing (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Let's compute them using De Moivre's theorem.\n\nFirst, express 1 + i in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1\u00b2 +1\u00b2)=sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i*13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i*13\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute [sqrt(2)]^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, compute the exponents:\n\ne^{i*13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1), because e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0} = -1.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i*13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * e^{-i3\u03c0} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * (-1).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-1) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-1) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1):\n\n= [(64\u221a2)(-1)e^{i\u03c0/4} - 1] * [(64\u221a2)(-1)e^{-i\u03c0/4} - 1]\n\nHmm, that looks complicated, but maybe we can compute it step by step.\n\nLet me denote A = 64\u221a2 * (-1) e^{i\u03c0/4} and B = 64\u221a2 * (-1) e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (A - 1)(B - 1) = AB - A - B + 1.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nAB = [64\u221a2 (-1) e^{i\u03c0/4}] * [64\u221a2 (-1) e^{-i\u03c0/4}] = (64\u221a2)^2 * (-1)^2 * e^{i\u03c0/4} e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (64\u221a2)^2: 64^2 = 4096, (\u221a2)^2=2, so 4096 * 2 = 8192.\n\n(-1)^2 = 1.\n\ne^{i\u03c0/4} e^{-i\u03c0/4} = e^{0} = 1.\n\nSo AB = 8192 * 1 * 1 = 8192.\n\nNext, compute -A - B:\n\n= - [64\u221a2 (-1) e^{i\u03c0/4} + 64\u221a2 (-1) e^{-i\u03c0/4} ]\n\n= - [ -64\u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4} -64\u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4} ]\n\n= 64\u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4} + 64\u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4}\n\n= 64\u221a2 [e^{i\u03c0/4} + e^{-i\u03c0/4}]\n\nNow, e^{i\u03c0/4} + e^{-i\u03c0/4} = 2 cos(\u03c0/4) = 2*(\u221a2/2) = \u221a2.\n\nSo, this term becomes 64\u221a2 * \u221a2 = 64*(2) = 128.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 64\u221a2 multiplied by \u221a2 is 64*(\u221a2 * \u221a2) = 64*2 = 128. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(A - 1)(B -1) = AB - A - B +1 = 8192 + 128 + 1 = 8192 + 128 is 8320, plus 1 is 8321.\n\nWait, wait, let me recheck the signs.\n\nWait, in the expansion, (A -1)(B -1) = AB -A - B +1.\n\nWe have AB=8192.\n\nThen, -A - B = 64\u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4} + 64\u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4} = 64\u221a2 (e^{i\u03c0/4} + e^{-i\u03c0/4}) = 64\u221a2 * \u221a2 = 128.\n\nSo, -A - B = 128.\n\nSo, AB -A - B +1 = 8192 - 128 +1? Wait no, because:\n\nWait, no: (A -1)(B -1) = AB - A - B +1.\n\nSo, AB = 8192.\n\nThen, -A - B = 64\u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4} + 64\u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4} = 64\u221a2 (e^{i\u03c0/4} + e^{-i\u03c0/4}) = 64\u221a2 * \u221a2 = 128.\n\nSo, -A - B = 128.\n\nSo, AB -A - B +1 = 8192 - 128 +1? Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, let's re-express:\n\n(A -1)(B -1) = AB - A - B + 1.\n\nWe have AB = 8192.\n\nThen, -A - B: as computed, it's 128.\n\nSo, AB - A - B +1 = 8192 + (-A - B) +1.\n\nBut wait, no: AB is 8192, then minus A minus B is subtracting A and B, so that's 8192 - A - B, then +1.\n\nWait, no, it's AB - A - B +1. So, AB is 8192, then subtract A and subtract B, then add 1.\n\nBut we found that -A - B = 128. So, AB - A - B = 8192 + 128 = 8320. Then +1 gives 8321.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Because (A -1)(B -1) = AB - A - B + 1.\n\nWe have AB = 8192.\n\nThen, -A - B = 64\u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4} + 64\u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4} = 64\u221a2 (e^{i\u03c0/4} + e^{-i\u03c0/4}) = 64\u221a2 * 2cos(\u03c0/4) = 64\u221a2 * (\u221a2) = 64*2 = 128.\n\nSo, AB - A - B = 8192 - (A + B) = 8192 - (-128) = 8192 + 128 = 8320. Wait, no, because A and B are both multiplied by -1. Let me think again.\n\nWait, A is (1+i)^13 = 64\u221a2 * (-1) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, B is (1-i)^13 = 64\u221a2 * (-1) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, A = -64\u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4}, B = -64\u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, A + B = -64\u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4} -64\u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4} = -64\u221a2 (e^{i\u03c0/4} + e^{-i\u03c0/4}) = -64\u221a2 * \u221a2 = -64*2 = -128.\n\nSo, -A - B = 64\u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4} + 64\u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4} = 64\u221a2 (e^{i\u03c0/4} + e^{-i\u03c0/4}) = 64\u221a2 * \u221a2 = 128.\n\nWait, but in the expression (A -1)(B -1) = AB - A - B +1.\n\nSo, AB = 8192.\n\nThen, -A - B: A is negative, so -A is positive, same with B.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute it as follows:\n\nCompute (A -1)(B -1) = AB - A - B +1.\n\nWe have AB = 8192.\n\nThen, -A - B = -(A + B) = -(-128) = 128.\n\nSo, AB - A - B +1 = 8192 + 128 +1 = 8321.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the product over all y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2) is 8321.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the product over all y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2) is equal to (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1), where a and b are the roots of f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. So, that product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the product from k=1 to 12 is equal to the product over all y^13=1, but since when y=1, the term is 1, the product from k=1 to 12 is 8321.\n\nWait, but wait, when I compute the product from y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 -2y +2), that includes y=1, which gives (1 -2 +2)=1. So, the product from y^13=1 is 8321, and the product from y^13=1 and y\u22601 is 8321/1 = 8321.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about it, the product from k=0 to 12 is equal to 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12, which is 8321. But wait, that can't be right because when I compute the product from y^13=1, including y=1, it's 8321, so the product from k=1 to 12 is 8321 as well. Because when y=1, the term is 1, so the product from y=1 to y^12 is 8321.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the product from k=0 to 12 is 1 * product from k=1 to 12, which is 8321.\n\nBut wait, no, the product from k=0 to 12 is \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), which is equal to 1 * product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = 8321.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with remainder 321.\n\nWait, but 8321 mod 1000 is 321, right? Because 1000 * 8 = 8000, 8321 -8000=321.\n\nSo, the answer is 321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because this is a crucial point.\n\nFirst, I converted the product into the product over all 13th roots of unity (including 1) of (y\u00b2 -2y +2), which I found to be 8321. Then, since when y=1, the term is 1, the product from k=1 to 12 is 8321. So, the entire product from k=0 to 12 is 1 * 8321 =8321.\n\nSo, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1). Let me recompute that.\n\nWe had a =1 +i, so a^13 = (1 +i)^13.\n\nExpressed in polar form, 1+i has modulus sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (sqrt(2))^13 = (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nAngle: 13 * \u03c0/4. 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nWait, but wait, 13 * \u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since 3\u03c0 is greater than 2\u03c0, subtract 2\u03c0 to get an equivalent angle: 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)).\n\nSimilarly, cos(5\u03c0/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(5\u03c0/4) is -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 +i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 +i).\n\nCompute 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSo, (1 +i)^13 = -64*(1 +i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 -i)^13 = -64*(1 -i).\n\nSo, (a^13 -1) = (-64*(1 +i) -1) = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (b^13 -1) = (-64*(1 -i) -1) = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * (-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that matches what I had before. So, the product is indeed 8321.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 321.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and \u03c9 \u2260 1. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that the 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation x^13 = 1. They can be expressed as \u03c9^k for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 12, where \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/13). Since \u03c9 \u2260 1, we're excluding k=0, which is just 1.\n\nNow, the product is over all these roots, so each term in the product is (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). That looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify each term.\n\nLet me look at one term: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Hmm, can I factor this or write it in a different way? Let's see:\n\n2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of \u03c9^k. Let me treat \u03c9^k as a variable, say x. So the term becomes x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nWait, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Let me see if this factors or if I can relate it to something else. The discriminant is b\u00b2 - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4, so it doesn't factor over the reals. But maybe in complex numbers, but perhaps it's more useful to think in terms of polynomials.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this as (x - a)(x - b), but since it doesn't factor over reals, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can relate it to cyclotomic polynomials or something else.\n\nWait, the product is over all 13th roots of unity except 1. So, each term is evaluated at \u03c9^k, for k=1 to 12, but wait, in the product, k goes from 0 to 12. But when k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1, so let me check what happens when k=0.\n\nWhen k=0, the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1^0 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nSo the entire product is equal to the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nHmm, maybe I can find a generating polynomial whose roots are these terms or relate this product to some known polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express each term as (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2) and recognize it as a value of some polynomial evaluated at \u03c9^k.\n\nLet me think about the polynomial f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Then, each term is f(\u03c9^k). So the product is the product of f(\u03c9^k) for k=1 to 12.\n\nWait, that's an interesting approach. So the product is \u220f_{k=1}^{12} f(\u03c9^k) where f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nNow, I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k=1 to 12 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. Because the 13th roots of unity except 1 are primitive.\n\nBut here, we're dealing with f(\u03c9^k) = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. So, perhaps I can relate the product \u220f_{k=1}^{12} f(\u03c9^k) to the value of another polynomial evaluated at certain points.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the product of f(\u03c9^k) over all k=1 to 12 as the product of f(x) evaluated at each root of \u03a6_13(x). So, maybe using properties of polynomials and roots.\n\nWait, another approach: The product of f(\u03c9^k) over all k=1 to 12 is equal to the resultant of f(x) and \u03a6_13(x), but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product is equal to the product of f(\u03c9^k) for each root \u03c9^k of \u03a6_13(x). So, since \u03a6_13(x) is the minimal polynomial for \u03c9, then the product would be related to evaluating f(x) at each root and multiplying.\n\nWait, but f(x) is a quadratic, and \u03a6_13(x) is degree 12. Maybe if I consider the product over all roots of \u03a6_13(x) of f(x), that would be the same as the resultant or something else.\n\nWait, another idea: For a polynomial P(x) with roots \u03b1_1, \u03b1_2, ..., \u03b1_n, the product of P(\u03b2_i) for i=1 to n is equal to the resultant of P and Q, where Q is another polynomial with roots \u03b2_i. But maybe that's getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the product as \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Let me write this as \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nLet me make a substitution: Let y = \u03c9^k. Then, since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, y ranges over all the 13th roots of unity except 1 as k goes from 1 to 12.\n\nSo the product becomes \u220f_{y^13=1, y\u22601} (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2).\n\nSo now, the product is over all y such that y^13 = 1 and y \u2260 1 of (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2).\n\nHmm, that seems more manageable. So, the product is the product of (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2) for all y \u2260 1 with y^13 =1.\n\nBut wait, how can I compute this product? Maybe I can relate it to evaluating a polynomial at certain points.\n\nLet me think: The product over all y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2) would be the same as evaluating the polynomial P(y) = y\u00b2 - 2y + 2 at each 13th root of unity and taking the product. But in our case, we exclude y=1, so the product is equal to [product over all y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2)] divided by (1\u00b2 - 2*1 + 2) = (1 - 2 + 2) = 1. So, actually, our product is equal to the product over all y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2).\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. Because when y=1, the term is 1, so the product over all y^13=1 is equal to the product from k=0 to 12, which includes y=1. But since when y=1, the term is 1, then the product over all y^13=1 is equal to the product we're looking for (from k=1 to 12) multiplied by 1. So, our product is equal to the product over all y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2).\n\nSo, perhaps I can compute this product as the resultant of P(y) = y\u00b2 - 2y + 2 and Q(y) = y^13 -1. Alternatively, maybe using properties of polynomials.\n\nWait, another approach: The product over all y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the product of (y - a)(y - b), where a and b are the roots of y\u00b2 - 2y + 2 = 0. So, if a and b are the roots, then the product becomes \u220f_{y^13=1} (y - a)(y - b) = \u220f_{y^13=1} (y - a) * \u220f_{y^13=1} (y - b).\n\nBut \u220f_{y^13=1} (y - a) is equal to a^13 -1, because the product of (y - a) over all y^13=1 is equal to (a^13 -1). Because the product of (y - a) for y being all roots of y^13 -1 =0 is equal to the value of y^13 -1 evaluated at a, which is a^13 -1. Similarly for b.\n\nWait, wait, that might be the case. Let me think about that. For any polynomial Q(y) with roots y_1, y_2, ..., y_n, then the product of (y - a) over all roots y_i is equal to Q(a). Because Q(y) = \u220f_{i=1}^n (y - y_i), so Q(a) = \u220f_{i=1}^n (a - y_i) = (-1)^n \u220f_{i=1}^n (y_i - a). So, if I take the product \u220f_{i=1}^n (y_i - a), that's equal to (-1)^n Q(a).\n\nIn our case, Q(y) = y^13 -1, which has roots y=1, \u03c9, \u03c9\u00b2, ..., \u03c9^12. So, the product over all y^13=1 of (y - a) is equal to Q(a) = a^13 -1.\n\nSimilarly, the product over all y^13=1 of (y - b) is b^13 -1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the product over all y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2) is equal to (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1), where a and b are the roots of y\u00b2 -2y +2=0.\n\nSo, let's find a and b. The quadratic equation y\u00b2 -2y +2 =0 has solutions:\n\ny = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo, a = 1 + i, b = 1 - i.\n\nNow, compute a^13 and b^13.\n\nHmm, computing (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Let's compute them using De Moivre's theorem.\n\nFirst, express 1 + i in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1\u00b2 +1\u00b2)=sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i*13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i*13\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute [sqrt(2)]^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, compute the exponents:\n\ne^{i*13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1), because e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0} = -1.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i*13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * e^{-i3\u03c0} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * (-1).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-1) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-1) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1):\n\n= [(64\u221a2)(-1)e^{i\u03c0/4} - 1] * [(64\u221a2)(-1)e^{-i\u03c0/4} - 1]\n\nHmm, that looks complicated, but maybe we can compute it step by step.\n\nLet me denote A = 64\u221a2 * (-1) e^{i\u03c0/4} and B = 64\u221a2 * (-1) e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (A - 1)(B - 1) = AB - A - B + 1.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nAB = [64\u221a2 (-1) e^{i\u03c0/4}] * [64\u221a2 (-1) e^{-i\u03c0/4}] = (64\u221a2)^2 * (-1)^2 * e^{i\u03c0/4} e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (64\u221a2)^2: 64^2 = 4096, (\u221a2)^2=2, so 4096 * 2 = 8192.\n\n(-1)^2 = 1.\n\ne^{i\u03c0/4} e^{-i\u03c0/4} = e^{0} = 1.\n\nSo AB = 8192 * 1 * 1 = 8192.\n\nNext, compute -A - B:\n\n= - [64\u221a2 (-1) e^{i\u03c0/4} + 64\u221a2 (-1) e^{-i\u03c0/4} ]\n\n= - [ -64\u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4} -64\u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4} ]\n\n= 64\u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4} + 64\u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4}\n\n= 64\u221a2 [e^{i\u03c0/4} + e^{-i\u03c0/4}]\n\nNow, e^{i\u03c0/4} + e^{-i\u03c0/4} = 2 cos(\u03c0/4) = 2*(\u221a2/2) = \u221a2.\n\nSo, this term becomes 64\u221a2 * \u221a2 = 64*(2) = 128.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 64\u221a2 multiplied by \u221a2 is 64*(\u221a2 * \u221a2) = 64*2 = 128. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(A - 1)(B -1) = AB - A - B +1 = 8192 + 128 + 1 = 8192 + 128 is 8320, plus 1 is 8321.\n\nWait, wait, let me recheck the signs.\n\nWait, in the expansion, (A -1)(B -1) = AB -A - B +1.\n\nWe have AB=8192.\n\nThen, -A - B = 64\u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4} + 64\u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4} = 64\u221a2 (e^{i\u03c0/4} + e^{-i\u03c0/4}) = 64\u221a2 * \u221a2 = 128.\n\nSo, -A - B = 128.\n\nSo, AB -A - B +1 = 8192 - 128 +1? Wait no, because:\n\nWait, no: (A -1)(B -1) = AB - A - B +1.\n\nSo, AB = 8192.\n\nThen, -A - B = 64\u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4} + 64\u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4} = 64\u221a2 (e^{i\u03c0/4} + e^{-i\u03c0/4}) = 64\u221a2 * \u221a2 = 128.\n\nSo, -A - B = 128.\n\nSo, AB -A - B +1 = 8192 - 128 +1? Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, let's re-express:\n\n(A -1)(B -1) = AB - A - B + 1.\n\nWe have AB = 8192.\n\nThen, -A - B: as computed, it's 128.\n\nSo, AB - A - B +1 = 8192 + (-A - B) +1.\n\nBut wait, no: AB is 8192, then minus A minus B is subtracting A and B, so that's 8192 - A - B, then +1.\n\nWait, no, it's AB - A - B +1. So, AB is 8192, then subtract A and subtract B, then add 1.\n\nBut we found that -A - B = 128. So, AB - A - B = 8192 + 128 = 8320. Then +1 gives 8321.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Because (A -1)(B -1) = AB - A - B + 1.\n\nWe have AB = 8192.\n\nThen, -A - B = 64\u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4} + 64\u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4} = 64\u221a2 (e^{i\u03c0/4} + e^{-i\u03c0/4}) = 64\u221a2 * 2cos(\u03c0/4) = 64\u221a2 * (\u221a2) = 64*2 = 128.\n\nSo, AB - A - B = 8192 - (A + B) = 8192 - (-128) = 8192 + 128 = 8320. Wait, no, because A and B are both multiplied by -1. Let me think again.\n\nWait, A is (1+i)^13 = 64\u221a2 * (-1) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, B is (1-i)^13 = 64\u221a2 * (-1) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, A = -64\u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4}, B = -64\u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, A + B = -64\u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4} -64\u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4} = -64\u221a2 (e^{i\u03c0/4} + e^{-i\u03c0/4}) = -64\u221a2 * \u221a2 = -64*2 = -128.\n\nSo, -A - B = 64\u221a2 e^{i\u03c0/4} + 64\u221a2 e^{-i\u03c0/4} = 64\u221a2 (e^{i\u03c0/4} + e^{-i\u03c0/4}) = 64\u221a2 * \u221a2 = 128.\n\nWait, but in the expression (A -1)(B -1) = AB - A - B +1.\n\nSo, AB = 8192.\n\nThen, -A - B: A is negative, so -A is positive, same with B.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute it as follows:\n\nCompute (A -1)(B -1) = AB - A - B +1.\n\nWe have AB = 8192.\n\nThen, -A - B = -(A + B) = -(-128) = 128.\n\nSo, AB - A - B +1 = 8192 + 128 +1 = 8321.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the product over all y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2) is 8321.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the product over all y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2) is equal to (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1), where a and b are the roots of f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. So, that product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the product from k=1 to 12 is equal to the product over all y^13=1, but since when y=1, the term is 1, the product from k=1 to 12 is 8321.\n\nWait, but wait, when I compute the product from y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 -2y +2), that includes y=1, which gives (1 -2 +2)=1. So, the product from y^13=1 is 8321, and the product from y^13=1 and y\u22601 is 8321/1 = 8321.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about it, the product from k=0 to 12 is equal to 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12, which is 8321. But wait, that can't be right because when I compute the product from y^13=1, including y=1, it's 8321, so the product from k=1 to 12 is 8321 as well. Because when y=1, the term is 1, so the product from y=1 to y^12 is 8321.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the product from k=0 to 12 is 1 * product from k=1 to 12, which is 8321.\n\nBut wait, no, the product from k=0 to 12 is \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), which is equal to 1 * product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = 8321.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with remainder 321.\n\nWait, but 8321 mod 1000 is 321, right? Because 1000 * 8 = 8000, 8321 -8000=321.\n\nSo, the answer is 321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because this is a crucial point.\n\nFirst, I converted the product into the product over all 13th roots of unity (including 1) of (y\u00b2 -2y +2), which I found to be 8321. Then, since when y=1, the term is 1, the product from k=1 to 12 is 8321. So, the entire product from k=0 to 12 is 1 * 8321 =8321.\n\nSo, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1). Let me recompute that.\n\nWe had a =1 +i, so a^13 = (1 +i)^13.\n\nExpressed in polar form, 1+i has modulus sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (sqrt(2))^13 = (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nAngle: 13 * \u03c0/4. 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0. So, 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nWait, but wait, 13 * \u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But since 3\u03c0 is greater than 2\u03c0, subtract 2\u03c0 to get an equivalent angle: 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)).\n\nSimilarly, cos(5\u03c0/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(5\u03c0/4) is -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 +i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 +i).\n\nCompute 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSo, (1 +i)^13 = -64*(1 +i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 -i)^13 = -64*(1 -i).\n\nSo, (a^13 -1) = (-64*(1 +i) -1) = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (b^13 -1) = (-64*(1 -i) -1) = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * (-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that matches what I had before. So, the product is indeed 8321.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 321.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive 13th root of unity (\\(\\omega \\neq 1\\)).\n\nFirst, recognize that the product can be rewritten as \\(\\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) since the term for \\(k=0\\) is 1. Each term \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\) can be expressed as \\(f(\\omega^k)\\), where \\(f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\\).\n\nThe product becomes \\(\\prod_{y^13=1, y \\neq 1} (y^2 - 2y + 2)\\), where \\(y\\) are the 13th roots of unity excluding 1. This product is equivalent to evaluating the polynomial \\(f(y)\\) at each root of \\(y^{13} - 1 = 0\\) and taking the product, excluding \\(y=1\\).\n\nUsing properties of polynomials and roots, the product \\(\\prod_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2)\\) can be computed as \\((a^{13} - 1)(b^{13} - 1)\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the roots of \\(f(x) = 0\\). Solving \\(x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0\\) gives \\(a = 1 + i\\) and \\(b = 1 - i\\).\n\nCalculating \\(a^{13}\\) and \\(b^{13}\\) using polar form and De Moivre's theorem yields:\n\\[\na^{13} = -64(1 + i), \\quad b^{13} = -64(1 - i).\n\\]\nThus, \\((a^{13} - 1)(b^{13} - 1) = (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = 8321\\).\n\nFinally, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is:\n\\[\n8321 \\mod 1000 = 321.\n\\]\n\n\\(\\boxed{321}\\)",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies \u03c9^13 = 1. Also, \u03c9 \u2260 1, which might be important because sometimes 1 is a root, but in this case, we're excluding it.\n\nThe expression I need to compute is the product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me write that down:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor this expression or relate it to some known polynomial. Let's see. Each term in the product is a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me denote \u03b6 = \u03c9^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2\u03b6 + \u03b6\u00b2. So, 2 - 2\u03b6 + \u03b6\u00b2. Let me rearrange that: \u03b6\u00b2 - 2\u03b6 + 2.\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation. Let me see if I can factor it or find its roots. The quadratic is \u03b6\u00b2 - 2\u03b6 + 2. The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, \u03b6\u00b2 - 2\u03b6 + 2 = (\u03b6 - (1 + i))(\u03b6 - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, each term in the product is (\u03b6 - (1 + i))(\u03b6 - (1 - i)), where \u03b6 = \u03c9^k. So, the entire product becomes the product over k from 0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich can be written as [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))]\n\nHmm, so that's the product of two products. Let me think about each product separately.\n\nSince \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, the set {\u03c9^0, \u03c9^1, ..., \u03c9^{12}} are all the 13th roots of unity. So, the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) is equal to x^13 - 1, because the roots of x^13 - 1 are exactly the 13th roots of unity, and the product of (x - root) for each root is the polynomial.\n\nWait, so if I take x = (1 + i), then \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ((1 + i) - \u03c9^k) = (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ((1 - i) - \u03c9^k) = (1 - i)^13 - 1.\n\nTherefore, the entire product is [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1]\n\nSo, now I need to compute this expression. Let me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians (45 degrees).\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has the same modulus, sqrt(2), but the argument is -\u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}, so (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). So, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4} and e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 3 * \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 13\u03c0/4. But 13\u03c0/4 is more than 2\u03c0, so let's subtract 2\u03c0 to get the equivalent angle between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\n13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, for the negative angle: -13\u03c0/4. Adding 2\u03c0 repeatedly until it's in the right range: -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} and e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 3\u03c0/4}.\n\nWe know that e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} is equal to cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{i * 3\u03c0/4} is cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2)(1 + i)\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2)(1 - i)\n\nWait, let me compute the multiplication:\n\nFirst, compute 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2). sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) is 2. So, 64 * 2 * (-1/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 * (1 + i)\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64 * (1 - i)\n\nSo, now, substituting back into our product:\n\nProduct = [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1] = [(-64)(1 + i) - 1] * [(-64)(1 - i) - 1]\n\nLet me compute each bracket:\n\nFirst bracket: (-64)(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i\n\nSecond bracket: (-64)(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i\n\nSo, Product = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i)\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nCompute modulus squared: (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321\n\nWait, let me compute 65 squared: 65^2 = 4225, 64^2=4096. So, 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, Product = 8321\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Let me compute (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i):\n\n= (-65)^2 - (64i)^2\n\n= 4225 - (4096)(i^2)\n\n= 4225 - (4096)(-1)\n\n= 4225 + 4096\n\n= 8321\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire product is 8321. Now, the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000. The remainder is the last three digits of the number.\n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my steps because sometimes with roots of unity and complex numbers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me go back.\n\nFirst, I expressed each term as \u03b6\u00b2 - 2\u03b6 + 2, which factors into (\u03b6 - (1 + i))(\u03b6 - (1 - i)). Then, the product over all k becomes the product over all roots \u03c9^k of (x - (1 + i)) and (x - (1 - i)). So, that's correct because the product over all \u03c9^k is the minimal polynomial, which is x^13 - 1. So, substituting x = 1 + i and x = 1 - i, respectively.\n\nThen, I computed (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI converted 1 + i to polar form: modulus sqrt(2), angle \u03c0/4. So, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is the same modulus, angle -\u03c0/4, so (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nThen, I calculated (sqrt(2))^13 as 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). That's correct.\n\nThen, 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is more than 2\u03c0. Subtracting 2\u03c0 gives 5\u03c0/4, so the angle becomes 5\u03c0/4, and the exponential is e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2. Similarly, e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i3\u03c0/4} = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2. That seems correct.\n\nThen, multiplying 64*sqrt(2) by (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2):\n\nsqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2, so 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64. Similarly for the imaginary part: same.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i). Same for (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i). Then, subtracting 1 gives:\n\nFirst term: (-64(1 + i) - 1) = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i\n\nSecond term: (-64(1 - i) - 1) = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i\n\nThen, multiplying these two: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 +4096=8321. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait a second, but the problem says \u03c9 \u22601. Did I use that somewhere? Let me see. In the initial product, when k=0, \u03c9^0=1. So, plugging k=0, the term becomes 2 - 2*1 +1^2 = 2 -2 +1=1. So, when k=0, the term is 1. So, the product is 1 multiplied by all the other terms. So, actually, the product is 1 * product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I included k=0, which gave (2 -2 +1)=1, so that's fine because the product remains the same.\n\nBut, wait, when I substituted x = 1 + i into the product, that included k=0. So, perhaps I should have considered that.\n\nWait, the product from k=0 to 12 is indeed the same as the product over all roots, including 1. But since 1 is a root, when I plug in x =1 + i, it's okay because 1 + i is not equal to any \u03c9^k unless 1 +i is a 13th root of unity, which it's not because its modulus is sqrt(2) \u22601. So, that's fine.\n\nBut just to make sure, perhaps I can think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product over all k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is equal to the product over all k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k +2). Maybe I can factor this as a polynomial in \u03c9^k.\n\nLet me denote y = \u03c9^k. Then, the term is y\u00b2 -2y +2. So, the product becomes \u220f_{y} (y\u00b2 -2y +2), where y runs over all 13th roots of unity.\n\nBut wait, the product over all y (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the resultant or something?\n\nAlternatively, note that the product over all y of (y - a) is equal to a^13 -1, but here we have a quadratic in y. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write this as \u220f_{y} (y\u00b2 -2y +2) = \u220f_{y} ( (y - (1 +i))(y - (1 -i)) ) as I did before, which gives the same result as before.\n\nSo, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nThus, the product is 8321, which mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me check 8321 divided by 1000. 1000 * 8 = 8000, so 8321 - 8000 = 321. So yes, 321 is the remainder.\n\nSo, the answer is 321.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies \u03c9^13 = 1. Also, \u03c9 \u2260 1, which might be important because sometimes 1 is a root, but in this case, we're excluding it.\n\nThe expression I need to compute is the product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me write that down:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor this expression or relate it to some known polynomial. Let's see. Each term in the product is a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me denote \u03b6 = \u03c9^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2\u03b6 + \u03b6\u00b2. So, 2 - 2\u03b6 + \u03b6\u00b2. Let me rearrange that: \u03b6\u00b2 - 2\u03b6 + 2.\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation. Let me see if I can factor it or find its roots. The quadratic is \u03b6\u00b2 - 2\u03b6 + 2. The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, \u03b6\u00b2 - 2\u03b6 + 2 = (\u03b6 - (1 + i))(\u03b6 - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, each term in the product is (\u03b6 - (1 + i))(\u03b6 - (1 - i)), where \u03b6 = \u03c9^k. So, the entire product becomes the product over k from 0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich can be written as [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))]\n\nHmm, so that's the product of two products. Let me think about each product separately.\n\nSince \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, the set {\u03c9^0, \u03c9^1, ..., \u03c9^{12}} are all the 13th roots of unity. So, the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) is equal to x^13 - 1, because the roots of x^13 - 1 are exactly the 13th roots of unity, and the product of (x - root) for each root is the polynomial.\n\nWait, so if I take x = (1 + i), then \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ((1 + i) - \u03c9^k) = (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ((1 - i) - \u03c9^k) = (1 - i)^13 - 1.\n\nTherefore, the entire product is [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1]\n\nSo, now I need to compute this expression. Let me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians (45 degrees).\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has the same modulus, sqrt(2), but the argument is -\u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}, so (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). So, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4} and e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 3 * \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 13\u03c0/4. But 13\u03c0/4 is more than 2\u03c0, so let's subtract 2\u03c0 to get the equivalent angle between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\n13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, for the negative angle: -13\u03c0/4. Adding 2\u03c0 repeatedly until it's in the right range: -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} and e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 3\u03c0/4}.\n\nWe know that e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} is equal to cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{i * 3\u03c0/4} is cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2)(1 + i)\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2)(1 - i)\n\nWait, let me compute the multiplication:\n\nFirst, compute 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2). sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) is 2. So, 64 * 2 * (-1/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 * (1 + i)\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64 * (1 - i)\n\nSo, now, substituting back into our product:\n\nProduct = [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1] = [(-64)(1 + i) - 1] * [(-64)(1 - i) - 1]\n\nLet me compute each bracket:\n\nFirst bracket: (-64)(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i\n\nSecond bracket: (-64)(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i\n\nSo, Product = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i)\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nCompute modulus squared: (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321\n\nWait, let me compute 65 squared: 65^2 = 4225, 64^2=4096. So, 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, Product = 8321\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Let me compute (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i):\n\n= (-65)^2 - (64i)^2\n\n= 4225 - (4096)(i^2)\n\n= 4225 - (4096)(-1)\n\n= 4225 + 4096\n\n= 8321\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire product is 8321. Now, the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000. The remainder is the last three digits of the number.\n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my steps because sometimes with roots of unity and complex numbers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me go back.\n\nFirst, I expressed each term as \u03b6\u00b2 - 2\u03b6 + 2, which factors into (\u03b6 - (1 + i))(\u03b6 - (1 - i)). Then, the product over all k becomes the product over all roots \u03c9^k of (x - (1 + i)) and (x - (1 - i)). So, that's correct because the product over all \u03c9^k is the minimal polynomial, which is x^13 - 1. So, substituting x = 1 + i and x = 1 - i, respectively.\n\nThen, I computed (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI converted 1 + i to polar form: modulus sqrt(2), angle \u03c0/4. So, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is the same modulus, angle -\u03c0/4, so (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nThen, I calculated (sqrt(2))^13 as 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). That's correct.\n\nThen, 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is more than 2\u03c0. Subtracting 2\u03c0 gives 5\u03c0/4, so the angle becomes 5\u03c0/4, and the exponential is e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2. Similarly, e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i3\u03c0/4} = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2. That seems correct.\n\nThen, multiplying 64*sqrt(2) by (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2):\n\nsqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2, so 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64. Similarly for the imaginary part: same.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i). Same for (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i). Then, subtracting 1 gives:\n\nFirst term: (-64(1 + i) - 1) = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i\n\nSecond term: (-64(1 - i) - 1) = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i\n\nThen, multiplying these two: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 +4096=8321. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait a second, but the problem says \u03c9 \u22601. Did I use that somewhere? Let me see. In the initial product, when k=0, \u03c9^0=1. So, plugging k=0, the term becomes 2 - 2*1 +1^2 = 2 -2 +1=1. So, when k=0, the term is 1. So, the product is 1 multiplied by all the other terms. So, actually, the product is 1 * product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I included k=0, which gave (2 -2 +1)=1, so that's fine because the product remains the same.\n\nBut, wait, when I substituted x = 1 + i into the product, that included k=0. So, perhaps I should have considered that.\n\nWait, the product from k=0 to 12 is indeed the same as the product over all roots, including 1. But since 1 is a root, when I plug in x =1 + i, it's okay because 1 + i is not equal to any \u03c9^k unless 1 +i is a 13th root of unity, which it's not because its modulus is sqrt(2) \u22601. So, that's fine.\n\nBut just to make sure, perhaps I can think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product over all k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is equal to the product over all k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k +2). Maybe I can factor this as a polynomial in \u03c9^k.\n\nLet me denote y = \u03c9^k. Then, the term is y\u00b2 -2y +2. So, the product becomes \u220f_{y} (y\u00b2 -2y +2), where y runs over all 13th roots of unity.\n\nBut wait, the product over all y (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the resultant or something?\n\nAlternatively, note that the product over all y of (y - a) is equal to a^13 -1, but here we have a quadratic in y. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write this as \u220f_{y} (y\u00b2 -2y +2) = \u220f_{y} ( (y - (1 +i))(y - (1 -i)) ) as I did before, which gives the same result as before.\n\nSo, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nThus, the product is 8321, which mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me check 8321 divided by 1000. 1000 * 8 = 8000, so 8321 - 8000 = 321. So yes, 321 is the remainder.\n\nSo, the answer is 321.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, satisfying \u03c9\u00b9\u00b3 = 1.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^n = 1, where n is the order. In this case, \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, so \u03c9^13 = 1. Also, since \u03c9 \u2260 1, it's one of the primitive roots. That might come in handy later.\n\nThe expression I'm supposed to evaluate is a product over k from 0 to 12. Each term in the product is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. So, for each k, I have a term like that. Let me write that out for a few values of k to see if I can spot a pattern or find a way to simplify it.\n\nWait, when k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1, so the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Hmm, okay, so the first term is 1. That might not complicate things too much.\n\nFor k=1, it's 2 - 2\u03c9 + \u03c9^2. For k=2, it's 2 - 2\u03c9^2 + \u03c9^4, and so on. Each term seems to involve \u03c9^{2k} as well. Maybe I can factor something out or find a pattern.\n\nI recall that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k from 0 to n-1 is equal to x^{n} - 1, but since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, the minimal polynomial is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is x^{12} + x^{11} + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor each term in the product. Let's see, each term is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me rewrite that: 2(1 - \u03c9^k) + \u03c9^{2k}. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, factor out \u03c9^{k}: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. That looks a bit like a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me set x = \u03c9^k, so the term becomes x^2 - 2x + 2.\n\nSo each term is x^2 - 2x + 2, where x = \u03c9^k. So the product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). So, I can write this as the product over x of (x^2 - 2x + 2), where x runs through all the 13th roots of unity except x=1? Wait, no. Because when k=0, x=\u03c9^0=1, so that term is included as well. So actually, x runs through all the 13th roots of unity.\n\nSo, the product is equal to the product over all x where x^13 = 1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2). Hmm, that's interesting. Because if I can express this product in terms of polynomials, maybe I can relate it to the minimal polynomials or something.\n\nI remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product of (x - a) where a runs through the roots of f(x) is f(x). But here, it's the product over (x^2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at each root of x^13 - 1 = 0. So, maybe I can use some properties of polynomials evaluated at roots of unity.\n\nWait, another approach: Since x^13 = 1 for each root x, perhaps I can factor the polynomial x^13 - 1 and relate it to the product I'm trying to compute.\n\nThe polynomial x^13 - 1 factors as (x - 1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + ... + x + 1). The roots of x^{12} + x^{11} + ... + x + 1 are the primitive 13th roots of unity, which are \u03c9, \u03c9^2, ..., \u03c9^{12}, since \u03c9 \u2260 1.\n\nSo, the product I'm trying to compute is the product of (x^2 - 2x + 2) for x = 1, \u03c9, \u03c9^2, ..., \u03c9^{12}. So, including x=1.\n\nWait, when x=1, the term is 1^2 - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So, the product is 1 times the product over \u03c9^k for k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nSo, the product becomes Product_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at x = \u03c9^k. Which is the same as evaluating the product over all 13th roots of unity of (x^2 - 2x + 2).\n\nI think there's a theorem that says that the product over all roots \u03b1 of f(x) of (a\u03b1 + b) is equal to resultant(f(x), a x + b, x). Or maybe it's related to evaluating another polynomial at certain points.\n\nAlternatively, another idea: If I have a polynomial P(x) = x^13 - 1, which has roots at all the 13th roots of unity. Then, the product over all roots x of (x^2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over x | P(x)=0 of (x^2 - 2x + 2). \n\nI think this can be expressed as the resultant of P(x) and Q(x), where Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Alternatively, perhaps the product is equal to the product of Q(x) evaluated at each root of P(x). So, the product is equal to the product of Q(\u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12.\n\nWait, but how do I compute the product of Q(\u03c9^k) for all k? Maybe I can use the fact that if Q(x) = (x - a)(x - b), then the product over Q(\u03c9^k) is equal to the product over (\u03c9^k - a)(\u03c9^k - b). So, that would be the product over (\u03c9^k - a) multiplied by the product over (\u03c9^k - b).\n\nBut the product over (\u03c9^k - a) for k=0 to 12 is equal to P(a), where P(x) = x^13 - 1. Because P(a) = a^13 -1 = 0 only if a is a 13th root of unity, but in this case, a is a constant. Wait, actually, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) from k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1. So, if I set x = a, then the product over (a - \u03c9^k) is a^13 - 1.\n\nSimilarly, the product over (a - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is a^13 - 1. So, for a constant a, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) evaluated at x=a is a^13 - 1.\n\nSo, applying that to our case, the product over (\u03c9^k - a) is (-1)^13 times the product over (a - \u03c9^k) which is (-1)^13 (a^13 - 1) = -(a^13 - 1) = 1 - a^13.\n\nSo, the product over (\u03c9^k - a) = 1 - a^13.\n\nSimilarly, the product over (\u03c9^k - b) = 1 - b^13.\n\nTherefore, the product over Q(\u03c9^k) = product over (\u03c9^k - a)(\u03c9^k - b) = [1 - a^13][1 - b^13], where a and b are the roots of Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2.\n\nSo, first, let's find the roots of Q(x). Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Using quadratic formula: x = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo, the roots are a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i.\n\nTherefore, the product over Q(\u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is [1 - a^13][1 - b^13].\n\nSo, I need to compute [1 - (1 + i)^13][1 - (1 - i)^13].\n\nHmm, that seems manageable. So, let's compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the angle (argument) is \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute [sqrt(2)]^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the angles: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1. So, 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so subtract 2\u03c0 to get it within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n3\u03c0 is equal to 2\u03c0 + \u03c0, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 2\u03c0 + 5\u03c0/4. So, subtracting 2\u03c0, we get 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, for the other angle: -13\u03c0/4. Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0. Let's add multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's positive.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 6\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0/4 + 24\u03c0/4) = 11\u03c0/4. 11\u03c0/4 is still more than 2\u03c0, subtract 2\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/4) to get 3\u03c0/4.\n\nWait, that might not be the right way. Let me think again. Alternatively, I can compute the angle as 13\u03c0/4, which is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. So, 3\u03c0 is an odd multiple of \u03c0, which would place it in the third quadrant. But when we take 13\u03c0/4, subtract 2\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/4), we get 5\u03c0/4. So, 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for -13\u03c0/4: adding 6\u03c0 (which is 24\u03c0/4) gives 11\u03c0/4, which is 2\u03c0 + 3\u03c0/4. Subtract 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0/4. So, 3\u03c0/4 is in the second quadrant.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4)].\n\nCompute cos(5\u03c0/4) and sin(5\u03c0/4): cos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, cos(3\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, sqrt(2) times sqrt(2)/2 is (2)/2 = 1. But with the negative signs:\n\n64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part:\n\n64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i ) = -64 i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13: 64*sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nCompute the real part: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nThe imaginary part: 64*sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 i) = 64*(1) i = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nNow, going back to the product [1 - (1 + i)^13][1 - (1 - i)^13].\n\nSubstitute the values we found:\n\n[1 - (-64 - 64i)][1 - (-64 + 64i)].\n\nSimplify each bracket:\n\nFirst bracket: 1 - (-64 -64i) = 1 +64 +64i = 65 +64i.\n\nSecond bracket: 1 - (-64 +64i) = 1 +64 -64i = 65 -64i.\n\nSo, the product becomes (65 +64i)(65 -64i). That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nCompute that: 65^2 + (64)^2.\n\n65^2 is 4225.\n\n64^2 is 4096.\n\nSo, 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check that again: 65^2 is indeed 4225, and 64^2 is 4096, so 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product over Q(\u03c9^k) from k=0 to 12 is 8321.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because this seems a bit high. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nSo, (1 + i) has magnitude sqrt(2), angle \u03c0/4. Raising to the 13th power gives (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64*sqrt(2). The angle is 13*(\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. So, 3\u03c0 is \u03c0 more than 2\u03c0, so subtracting 2\u03c0 gives \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4, which is correct. So, cos(5\u03c0/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, sin is -sqrt(2)/2. So, when multiplied by 64*sqrt(2), the real part is 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-2/2) = -64. Similarly, the imaginary part is the same, giving -64i. So, (1 + i)^13 is indeed -64 -64i. Similarly, (1 - i)^13 is -64 +64i.\n\nSo, 1 - (1 + i)^13 is 1 - (-64 -64i) = 65 +64i. Similarly, 1 - (1 - i)^13 is 65 -64i. Their product is (65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product over all k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is 8321.\n\nWait, but the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1. Does that affect anything? Because when k=0, \u03c9^0=1, which is excluded. So, in the product, k=0 to 12 includes \u03c9^0=1. But the problem states \u03c9 \u2260 1, but \u03c9^k can be 1 when k=0. Hmm, maybe I misapplied the formula.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the initial problem statement. It says \u03c9 \u2260 1 is a 13th root of unity. So, the product is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), but \u03c9 \u2260 1. So, when k=0, \u03c9^0=1, so the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 1. So, that term is included. So, the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including 1. So, my calculation is correct because I included x=1 in the product.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Now, I need to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000. That's straightforward: 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait a second, but let me confirm that 8321 mod 1000 is indeed 321. Yes, because 8000 is 8*1000, so 8321 - 8000 = 321. So, 321 is the remainder.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 321.\n",

Alternatively, perhaps the product is equal to the product of Q(x) evaluated at each root of P(x). So, the product is equal to the product of Q(\u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12.\n\nWait, but how do I compute the product of Q(\u03c9^k) for all k? Maybe I can use the fact that if Q(x) = (x - a)(x - b), then the product over Q(\u03c9^k) is equal to the product over (\u03c9^k - a)(\u03c9^k - b). So, that would be the product over (\u03c9^k - a) multiplied by the product over (\u03c9^k - b).\n\nBut the product over (\u03c9^k - a) for k=0 to 12 is equal to P(a), where P(x) = x^13 - 1. Because P(a) = a^13 -1 = 0 only if a is a 13th root of unity, but in this case, a is a constant. Wait, actually, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) from k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1. So, if I set x = a, then the product over (a - \u03c9^k) is a^13 - 1.\n\nSimilarly, the product over (a - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is a^13 - 1. So, for a constant a, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) evaluated at x=a is a^13 - 1.\n\nSo, applying that to our case, the product over (\u03c9^k - a) is (-1)^13 times the product over (a - \u03c9^k) which is (-1)^13 (a^13 - 1) = -(a^13 - 1) = 1 - a^13.\n\nSo, the product over (\u03c9^k - a) = 1 - a^13.\n\nSimilarly, the product over (\u03c9^k - b) = 1 - b^13.\n\nTherefore, the product over Q(\u03c9^k) = product over (\u03c9^k - a)(\u03c9^k - b) = [1 - a^13][1 - b^13], where a and b are the roots of Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2.\n\nSo, first, let's find the roots of Q(x). Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Using quadratic formula: x = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo, the roots are a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i.\n\nTherefore, the product over Q(\u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is [1 - a^13][1 - b^13].\n\nSo, I need to compute [1 - (1 + i)^13][1 - (1 - i)^13].\n\nHmm, that seems manageable. So, let's compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the angle (argument) is \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute [sqrt(2)]^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the angles: 13 * \u03c0/4. Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1. So, 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so subtract 2\u03c0 to get it within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n3\u03c0 is equal to 2\u03c0 + \u03c0, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 2\u03c0 + 5\u03c0/4. So, subtracting 2\u03c0, we get 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, for the other angle: -13\u03c0/4. Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0. Let's add multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's positive.\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 6\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0/4 + 24\u03c0/4) = 11\u03c0/4. 11\u03c0/4 is still more than 2\u03c0, subtract 2\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/4) to get 3\u03c0/4.\n\nWait, that might not be the right way. Let me think again. Alternatively, I can compute the angle as 13\u03c0/4, which is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. So, 3\u03c0 is an odd multiple of \u03c0, which would place it in the third quadrant. But when we take 13\u03c0/4, subtract 2\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/4), we get 5\u03c0/4. So, 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for -13\u03c0/4: adding 6\u03c0 (which is 24\u03c0/4) gives 11\u03c0/4, which is 2\u03c0 + 3\u03c0/4. Subtract 2\u03c0, so 3\u03c0/4. So, 3\u03c0/4 is in the second quadrant.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)].\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4)].\n\nCompute cos(5\u03c0/4) and sin(5\u03c0/4): cos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, cos(3\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, sqrt(2) times sqrt(2)/2 is (2)/2 = 1. But with the negative signs:\n\n64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part:\n\n64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 i ) = -64 i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13: 64*sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nCompute the real part: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nThe imaginary part: 64*sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 i) = 64*(1) i = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nNow, going back to the product [1 - (1 + i)^13][1 - (1 - i)^13].\n\nSubstitute the values we found:\n\n[1 - (-64 - 64i)][1 - (-64 + 64i)].\n\nSimplify each bracket:\n\nFirst bracket: 1 - (-64 -64i) = 1 +64 +64i = 65 +64i.\n\nSecond bracket: 1 - (-64 +64i) = 1 +64 -64i = 65 -64i.\n\nSo, the product becomes (65 +64i)(65 -64i). That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nCompute that: 65^2 + (64)^2.\n\n65^2 is 4225.\n\n64^2 is 4096.\n\nSo, 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check that again: 65^2 is indeed 4225, and 64^2 is 4096, so 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product over Q(\u03c9^k) from k=0 to 12 is 8321.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because this seems a bit high. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nSo, (1 + i) has magnitude sqrt(2), angle \u03c0/4. Raising to the 13th power gives (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64*sqrt(2). The angle is 13*(\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. So, 3\u03c0 is \u03c0 more than 2\u03c0, so subtracting 2\u03c0 gives \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4, which is correct. So, cos(5\u03c0/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, sin is -sqrt(2)/2. So, when multiplied by 64*sqrt(2), the real part is 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-2/2) = -64. Similarly, the imaginary part is the same, giving -64i. So, (1 + i)^13 is indeed -64 -64i. Similarly, (1 - i)^13 is -64 +64i.\n\nSo, 1 - (1 + i)^13 is 1 - (-64 -64i) = 65 +64i. Similarly, 1 - (1 - i)^13 is 65 -64i. Their product is (65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product over all k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is 8321.\n\nWait, but the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1. Does that affect anything? Because when k=0, \u03c9^0=1, which is excluded. So, in the product, k=0 to 12 includes \u03c9^0=1. But the problem states \u03c9 \u2260 1, but \u03c9^k can be 1 when k=0. Hmm, maybe I misapplied the formula.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the initial problem statement. It says \u03c9 \u2260 1 is a 13th root of unity. So, the product is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), but \u03c9 \u2260 1. So, when k=0, \u03c9^0=1, so the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 1. So, that term is included. So, the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including 1. So, my calculation is correct because I included x=1 in the product.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Now, I need to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000. That's straightforward: 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait a second, but let me confirm that 8321 mod 1000 is indeed 321. Yes, because 8000 is 8*1000, so 8321 - 8000 = 321. So, 321 is the remainder.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 321.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, satisfying \u03c9^13 = 1. The product we need to evaluate is:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\n\\]\n\nWe rewrite each term as \\( \\omega^{2k} - 2\\omega^k + 2 \\), which is a quadratic in \\( \\omega^k \\). Letting \\( x = \\omega^k \\), each term becomes \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\). Thus, the product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( x \\) runs over all 13th roots of unity. This product can be expressed as the product of \\( (x^2 - 2x + 2) \\) evaluated at each root of \\( x^{13} - 1 = 0 \\).\n\nThe quadratic \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) has roots \\( 1 + i \\) and \\( 1 - i \\). Using properties of polynomials evaluated at roots of unity, the product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2) = [1 - (1 + i)^{13}][1 - (1 - i)^{13}]\n\\]\n\nWe compute \\( (1 + i)^{13} \\) and \\( (1 - i)^{13} \\) using polar forms. Since \\( 1 + i = \\sqrt{2} e^{i\\pi/4} \\), raising to the 13th power gives:\n\n\\[\n(1 + i)^{13} = ( \\sqrt{2} )^{13} e^{i \\cdot 13\\pi/4} = 64\\sqrt{2} \\left( \\cos\\frac{5\\pi}{4} + i\\sin\\frac{5\\pi}{4} \\right) = -64 - 64i\n\\]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\\[\n(1 - i)^{13} = ( \\sqrt{2} )^{13} e^{-i \\cdot 13\\pi/4} = 64\\sqrt{2} \\left( \\cos\\frac{3\\pi}{4} + i\\sin\\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\right) = -64 + 64i\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these into the product:\n\n\\[\n[1 - (-64 - 64i)][1 - (-64 + 64i)] = (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65^2 + 64^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000:\n\n\\[\n8321 \\mod 1000 = 321\n\\]\n\nThus, the remainder is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{321}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy \u03c9^n = 1 for some integer n. Since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and \u03c9 \u2260 1, it's one of the primitive roots, right? So, \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k for k=0 to 12 gives all the distinct 13th roots of unity.\n\nThe product I need to compute is \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). That looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can find a pattern or a way to simplify it.\n\nWait, each term in the product is of the form 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me see if I can factor this or express it differently. Maybe factor out something? Let's see:\n\n2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2.\n\nHmm, that looks like a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me write it as:\n\n(\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2.\n\nSo, for each k, the term is (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2. That seems like a quadratic equation. Maybe I can factor it or find roots? Let me try to factor it:\n\nLooking for two numbers a and b such that a * b = 2 and a + b = -2. Wait, no, the middle term is -2, so perhaps it's (\u03c9^k - a)(\u03c9^k - b) = \u03c9^{2k} - (a + b)\u03c9^k + ab. So, ab = 2 and a + b = 2. Wait, no, in the quadratic it's -2\u03c9^k, so a + b = 2.\n\nWait, let me think again. The quadratic is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, where x = \u03c9^k. So, the roots would be [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). \n\nSo, each term can be written as (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product becomes:\n\n\u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, I can separate this into two products:\n\n[\u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [\u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nNow, I remember that for roots of unity, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to n-1 is equal to x^n - 1. Because the roots are exactly the nth roots of unity. But wait, in our case, the product is over (\u03c9^k - a), which is similar but with a sign. Let me see.\n\nIf I let x = 1 + i, then the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) would be equal to x^{13} - 1, but wait, no. Because for x \u2260 \u03c9^k, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) is equal to x^{13} - 1. Wait, actually, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^{13} - 1, because the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is (x^{13} - 1)/(x - 1) = x^{12} + x^{11} + ... + x + 1. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, no. The product over all (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is indeed x^{13} - 1, because when you multiply (x - \u03c9^0)(x - \u03c9^1)...(x - \u03c9^{12}) you get x^{13} - 1. Because \u03c9^0 is 1, so the product is (x - 1)(x - \u03c9)...(x - \u03c9^{12}) = x^{13} - 1.\n\nBut in our case, the product is \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a), which is \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) with a negative sign. So, each term is (a - \u03c9^k) = -(\u03c9^k - a). So, the product becomes (-1)^{13} * \u03a0 (\u03c9^k - a) = - \u03a0 (\u03c9^k - a). But \u03a0 (\u03c9^k - a) is equal to (a^{13} - 1) because it's the product of (a - \u03c9^k) for all k, which is a^{13} - 1. Wait, no, let me think.\n\nWait, if I have \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^{13} - 1. So, substituting x = a, we get \u03a0 (a - \u03c9^k) = a^{13} - 1. Therefore, \u03a0 (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^{13} * \u03a0 (a - \u03c9^k) = (-1)^{13} (a^{13} - 1) = - (a^{13} - 1) = 1 - a^{13}.\n\nSo, in our case, for each product:\n\n\u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = 1 - (1 + i)^{13}\n\nSimilarly, \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = 1 - (1 - i)^{13}\n\nTherefore, the entire product is [1 - (1 + i)^{13}] * [1 - (1 - i)^{13}].\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to computing this product and then taking modulo 1000.\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^{13} and (1 - i)^{13} first.\n\nI know that (1 + i) has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, in polar form, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^{13}.\n\nsqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^{13} = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^{13} = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}\n\nNow, let's compute e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is the same as \u03c0/4 after subtracting 2\u03c0 (since angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0). So, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(\u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0)} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1), because e^{i\u03c0} = -1.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(\u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0)} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * e^{-i3\u03c0} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * (-1).\n\nTherefore:\n\n(1 + i)^{13} = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-1) * e^{i\u03c0/4}\n\n= -64 * sqrt(2) * (cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4))\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^{13} = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-1) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}\n\n= -64 * sqrt(2) * (cos(\u03c0/4) - i sin(\u03c0/4))\n\nCompute cos(\u03c0/4) and sin(\u03c0/4):\n\ncos(\u03c0/4) = sin(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + i)^{13} = -64 * sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2)\n= -64 * sqrt(2) * [sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i)]\n= -64 * sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2) * (1 + i)\n= -64 * (2/2) * (1 + i)\n= -64 * (1 + i)\n= -64 - 64i\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(1 - i)^{13} = -64 * sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2)\n= -64 * sqrt(2) * [sqrt(2)/2 (1 - i)]\n= -64 * sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2) * (1 - i)\n= -64 * (2/2) * (1 - i)\n= -64 * (1 - i)\n= -64 + 64i\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n(1 + i)^{13} = -64 - 64i\n(1 - i)^{13} = -64 + 64i\n\nTherefore, let's compute 1 - (1 + i)^{13} and 1 - (1 - i)^{13}.\n\nFirst, 1 - (1 + i)^{13} = 1 - (-64 -64i) = 1 +64 +64i = 65 +64i\n\nSimilarly, 1 - (1 - i)^{13} = 1 - (-64 +64i) = 1 +64 -64i = 65 -64i\n\nSo, the product is (65 +64i)(65 -64i).\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it equals |65 +64i|^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n65^2 = 4225.\n\n64^2 = 4096.\n\nSo, 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Yes.\n\nSo, the entire product is 8321.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000. The remainder is the last three digits, which is 321.\n\nWait, wait, let me confirm:\n\n8321 / 1000 = 8 * 1000 + 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 321.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check all the steps because it's easy to make a mistake with signs or exponents.\n\nFirst, the initial step: expressing each term as (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) seems correct.\n\nThen, realizing that the product over k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - a) is 1 - a^{13}, that comes from the fact that the product over (x - \u03c9^k) is x^{13} - 1, so substituting x = a, we get (a^{13} -1 ), but since it's (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)(a - \u03c9^k), so the product is (-1)^13 (a^{13} -1) = 1 - a^{13}.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nThen, computing (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Converting to polar form is correct. (1 + i) is sqrt(2) at 45 degrees, so when raised to 13, the angle becomes 13*45 = 585 degrees, which is equivalent to 585 - 360 = 225 degrees, which is 180 + 45, so in the third quadrant. The magnitude is (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 8 * 2^6? Wait, 2^6 is 64, so 2^(13/2) is 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2). So, that's correct.\n\nWait, 2^6 is 64, yes, and 2^(13/2) is 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64*sqrt(2). So, correct.\n\nThen, 13\u03c0/4 is indeed 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to \u03c0/4 in terms of angle after subtracting 2\u03c0. So, the exponential terms become e^{i\u03c0/4} and e^{-i\u03c0/4}, multiplied by -1 because of the 3\u03c0.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 is -64*sqrt(2)*(cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)).\n\nCalculating that gives:\n\ncos(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2, same for sin.\n\nSo, sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 = 1. So, 64*sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 = 64* (2)/2 = 64. So, 64*sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2) is 64.\n\nBut wait, in the calculation above, I think I might have miscalculated. Let me recheck:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64*sqrt(2)*(cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)).\n\nCompute cos(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n= -64*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2)\n= -64*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i))\n= -64*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2*(1 + i)\n= -64*(2)/2*(1 + i)\n= -64*(1 + i)\n= -64 -64i.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for (1 - i)^13, it's -64 +64i.\n\nThen, 1 - (1 + i)^13 is 1 - (-64 -64i) = 65 +64i.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - (1 - i)^13 is 65 -64i.\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\n(65 +64i)(65 -64i) = 65\u00b2 +64\u00b2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. That's correct.\n\n8321 mod 1000 is 321. So, yes, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the cyclotomic polynomial part. Because sometimes when dealing with roots of unity, especially primitive roots, some factors might come into play.\n\nWait, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^{13} -1, correct. So, when x is (1 + i), the product becomes (1 + i)^{13} -1, but since we have (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = -(1 + i - \u03c9^k), so the product is (-1)^13 * product(1 + i - \u03c9^k) = - (1 + i)^{13} +1.\n\nWait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) * (-1)^{13} because each term is (a - \u03c9^k) multiplied by (-1). So, it's (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = (-1)^13 * (a^{13} - 1) = - (a^{13} -1) = 1 - a^{13}.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, yes, the product is 1 - (1 + i)^13 and 1 - (1 - i)^13, which we computed correctly.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 321.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that each term in the product can be expressed as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. We factorize each term and utilize properties of roots of unity to simplify the product. After calculating the necessary powers and products, we find the remainder modulo 1000.\n\nThe remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is \\(\\boxed{321}\\).",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy \u03c9^n = 1 for some integer n. Since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity and \u03c9 \u2260 1, it's one of the primitive roots, right? So, \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k for k=0 to 12 gives all the distinct 13th roots of unity.\n\nThe product I need to compute is \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). That looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can find a pattern or a way to simplify it.\n\nWait, each term in the product is of the form 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me see if I can factor this or express it differently. Maybe factor out something? Let's see:\n\n2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2.\n\nHmm, that looks like a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me write it as:\n\n(\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2.\n\nSo, for each k, the term is (\u03c9^k)^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2. That seems like a quadratic equation. Maybe I can factor it or find roots? Let me try to factor it:\n\nLooking for two numbers a and b such that a * b = 2 and a + b = -2. Wait, no, the middle term is -2, so perhaps it's (\u03c9^k - a)(\u03c9^k - b) = \u03c9^{2k} - (a + b)\u03c9^k + ab. So, ab = 2 and a + b = 2. Wait, no, in the quadratic it's -2\u03c9^k, so a + b = 2.\n\nWait, let me think again. The quadratic is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, where x = \u03c9^k. So, the roots would be [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). \n\nSo, each term can be written as (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product becomes:\n\n\u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, I can separate this into two products:\n\n[\u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [\u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nNow, I remember that for roots of unity, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to n-1 is equal to x^n - 1. Because the roots are exactly the nth roots of unity. But wait, in our case, the product is over (\u03c9^k - a), which is similar but with a sign. Let me see.\n\nIf I let x = 1 + i, then the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - x) would be equal to x^{13} - 1, but wait, no. Because for x \u2260 \u03c9^k, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) is equal to x^{13} - 1. Wait, actually, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^{13} - 1, because the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is (x^{13} - 1)/(x - 1) = x^{12} + x^{11} + ... + x + 1. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, no. The product over all (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is indeed x^{13} - 1, because when you multiply (x - \u03c9^0)(x - \u03c9^1)...(x - \u03c9^{12}) you get x^{13} - 1. Because \u03c9^0 is 1, so the product is (x - 1)(x - \u03c9)...(x - \u03c9^{12}) = x^{13} - 1.\n\nBut in our case, the product is \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a), which is \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) with a negative sign. So, each term is (a - \u03c9^k) = -(\u03c9^k - a). So, the product becomes (-1)^{13} * \u03a0 (\u03c9^k - a) = - \u03a0 (\u03c9^k - a). But \u03a0 (\u03c9^k - a) is equal to (a^{13} - 1) because it's the product of (a - \u03c9^k) for all k, which is a^{13} - 1. Wait, no, let me think.\n\nWait, if I have \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^{13} - 1. So, substituting x = a, we get \u03a0 (a - \u03c9^k) = a^{13} - 1. Therefore, \u03a0 (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^{13} * \u03a0 (a - \u03c9^k) = (-1)^{13} (a^{13} - 1) = - (a^{13} - 1) = 1 - a^{13}.\n\nSo, in our case, for each product:\n\n\u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = 1 - (1 + i)^{13}\n\nSimilarly, \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) = 1 - (1 - i)^{13}\n\nTherefore, the entire product is [1 - (1 + i)^{13}] * [1 - (1 - i)^{13}].\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to computing this product and then taking modulo 1000.\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^{13} and (1 - i)^{13} first.\n\nI know that (1 + i) has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, in polar form, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^{13}.\n\nsqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^{13} = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^{13} = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}\n\nNow, let's compute e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is the same as \u03c0/4 after subtracting 2\u03c0 (since angles are periodic modulo 2\u03c0). So, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i*(\u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0)} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1), because e^{i\u03c0} = -1.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i*(\u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0)} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * e^{-i3\u03c0} = e^{-i\u03c0/4} * (-1).\n\nTherefore:\n\n(1 + i)^{13} = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-1) * e^{i\u03c0/4}\n\n= -64 * sqrt(2) * (cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4))\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^{13} = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-1) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}\n\n= -64 * sqrt(2) * (cos(\u03c0/4) - i sin(\u03c0/4))\n\nCompute cos(\u03c0/4) and sin(\u03c0/4):\n\ncos(\u03c0/4) = sin(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + i)^{13} = -64 * sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2)\n= -64 * sqrt(2) * [sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i)]\n= -64 * sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2) * (1 + i)\n= -64 * (2/2) * (1 + i)\n= -64 * (1 + i)\n= -64 - 64i\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(1 - i)^{13} = -64 * sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2)\n= -64 * sqrt(2) * [sqrt(2)/2 (1 - i)]\n= -64 * sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2) * (1 - i)\n= -64 * (2/2) * (1 - i)\n= -64 * (1 - i)\n= -64 + 64i\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n(1 + i)^{13} = -64 - 64i\n(1 - i)^{13} = -64 + 64i\n\nTherefore, let's compute 1 - (1 + i)^{13} and 1 - (1 - i)^{13}.\n\nFirst, 1 - (1 + i)^{13} = 1 - (-64 -64i) = 1 +64 +64i = 65 +64i\n\nSimilarly, 1 - (1 - i)^{13} = 1 - (-64 +64i) = 1 +64 -64i = 65 -64i\n\nSo, the product is (65 +64i)(65 -64i).\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it equals |65 +64i|^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n65^2 = 4225.\n\n64^2 = 4096.\n\nSo, 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Yes.\n\nSo, the entire product is 8321.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000. The remainder is the last three digits, which is 321.\n\nWait, wait, let me confirm:\n\n8321 / 1000 = 8 * 1000 + 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 321.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check all the steps because it's easy to make a mistake with signs or exponents.\n\nFirst, the initial step: expressing each term as (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) seems correct.\n\nThen, realizing that the product over k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - a) is 1 - a^{13}, that comes from the fact that the product over (x - \u03c9^k) is x^{13} - 1, so substituting x = a, we get (a^{13} -1 ), but since it's (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)(a - \u03c9^k), so the product is (-1)^13 (a^{13} -1) = 1 - a^{13}.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nThen, computing (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Converting to polar form is correct. (1 + i) is sqrt(2) at 45 degrees, so when raised to 13, the angle becomes 13*45 = 585 degrees, which is equivalent to 585 - 360 = 225 degrees, which is 180 + 45, so in the third quadrant. The magnitude is (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 8 * 2^6? Wait, 2^6 is 64, so 2^(13/2) is 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2). So, that's correct.\n\nWait, 2^6 is 64, yes, and 2^(13/2) is 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64*sqrt(2). So, correct.\n\nThen, 13\u03c0/4 is indeed 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to \u03c0/4 in terms of angle after subtracting 2\u03c0. So, the exponential terms become e^{i\u03c0/4} and e^{-i\u03c0/4}, multiplied by -1 because of the 3\u03c0.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 is -64*sqrt(2)*(cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)).\n\nCalculating that gives:\n\ncos(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2, same for sin.\n\nSo, sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 = 1. So, 64*sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 = 64* (2)/2 = 64. So, 64*sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2) is 64.\n\nBut wait, in the calculation above, I think I might have miscalculated. Let me recheck:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64*sqrt(2)*(cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)).\n\nCompute cos(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n= -64*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2)\n= -64*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i))\n= -64*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2*(1 + i)\n= -64*(2)/2*(1 + i)\n= -64*(1 + i)\n= -64 -64i.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for (1 - i)^13, it's -64 +64i.\n\nThen, 1 - (1 + i)^13 is 1 - (-64 -64i) = 65 +64i.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - (1 - i)^13 is 65 -64i.\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\n(65 +64i)(65 -64i) = 65\u00b2 +64\u00b2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Because sometimes when dealing with roots of unity, especially primitive roots, some factors might come into play.\n\nWait, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^{13} -1, correct. So, when x is (1 + i), the product becomes (1 + i)^{13} -1, but since we have (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) = -(1 + i - \u03c9^k), so the product is (-1)^13 * product(1 + i - \u03c9^k) = - (1 + i)^{13} +1.\n\nWait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) * (-1)^{13} because each term is (a - \u03c9^k) multiplied by (-1). So, it's (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = (-1)^13 * (a^{13} - 1) = - (a^{13} -1) = 1 - a^{13}.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, yes, the product is 1 - (1 + i)^13 and 1 - (1 - i)^13, which we computed correctly.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 321.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that each term in the product can be expressed as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. We factorize each term and utilize properties of roots of unity to simplify the product. After calculating the necessary powers and products, we find the remainder modulo 1000.\n\nThe remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is \\(\\boxed{321}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when dealing with polynomials. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation \u03c9^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure yet how that will help here.\n\nThe product is over all k from 0 to 12, so that's all the 13th roots of unity, including \u03c9^0 = 1. Each term in the product is of the form 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me denote this term as P_k = 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}.\n\nI need to compute the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} P_k. Since \u03c9^k runs through all 13th roots of unity as k goes from 0 to 12, maybe there's a way to relate this product to a polynomial evaluated at certain points.\n\nWait, another thought: since the product is over all k, maybe it's equivalent to evaluating some polynomial at specific values and then taking the product of those evaluations. Let's see.\n\nLet me consider the polynomial f(x) = 2 - 2x + x\u00b2. Then, each P_k is f(\u03c9^k). So the product becomes \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} f(\u03c9^k). \n\nBut since \u03c9^k are all the 13th roots of unity, this product is the product of f evaluated at each 13th root of unity. I remember that for a polynomial, the product over all roots can be related to its value at certain points.\n\nWait, more precisely, if I have a polynomial Q(x) of degree n, then the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{n-1} Q(\u03c9^k) is equal to the resultant of Q(x) and x^n - 1, or something like that. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the product over all (x - \u03c9^k) is x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1.\n\nBut in this case, I'm evaluating a different polynomial f(x) at each \u03c9^k and taking the product. So, perhaps I can use the formula that says \u03a0_{k=0}^{n-1} Q(\u03c9^k) = \u03a0_{k=0}^{n-1} Q(e^{2\u03c0ik/n}) }, which might relate to the resultant or something else.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that if Q(x) is a polynomial, then the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{n-1} Q(\u03c9^k) is equal to the resultant of Q(x) and x^n - 1, which is the same as the product of Q evaluated at each root of x^n - 1. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, another approach: if f(x) = 2 - 2x + x\u00b2, then f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Let me see if this factors or relates to any cyclotomic polynomials.\n\nLet me compute the discriminant of f(x). The discriminant D = b\u00b2 - 4ac = ( -2 )\u00b2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots of f(x) are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So the roots are 1 + i and 1 - i, which are 8th roots of unity? Wait, no. Let me compute their magnitudes.\n\nThe magnitude of 1 + i is sqrt(2), so they're not roots of unity. Hmm, maybe that's a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write f(x) as x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 and relate it to the minimal polynomials over the cyclotomic field.\n\nWait, another idea: the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} f(\u03c9^k) can be thought of as the product over all 13th roots of unity of f(\u03c9^k). So, if I think of f(x) as a polynomial, then the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} f(\u03c9^k) is equal to the product of f(\u03c9^k) for each \u03c9^k, which are the roots of x^13 - 1 = 0. So, maybe this relates to the value of the resultant or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the product of f(\u03c9^k) for all k is equal to the product of f(\u03c9^k) over k=0 to 12, which is the same as the product over all roots of x^13 - 1 of f(x). \n\nWait, maybe using the formula that the product of Q(\u03b1) over all roots \u03b1 of a polynomial P(x) is equal to the resultant of P and Q, up to some sign or power. Alternatively, another approach: since f(x) is a quadratic, perhaps I can consider the product as the product of f(\u03c9^k) over all \u03c9^k, which is the same as the product over all \u03c9^k of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nWait, maybe I can express 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} in another way. Let me factor that expression:\n\n2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2.\n\nHmm, maybe factor out \u03c9^k? Let's see:\n\n= \u03c9^k (\u03c9^k - 2) + 2.\n\nNot sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps write it as \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. Maybe factor this quadratic in \u03c9^k:\n\nLet me treat \u03c9^k as a variable, say z. Then the expression becomes z\u00b2 - 2z + 2. So f(z) = z\u00b2 - 2z + 2.\n\nThen, the product over all k=0 to 12 of f(\u03c9^k) is \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nWait, another thought: since \u03c9^13 = 1, then \u03c9^{k+13} = \u03c9^k. So, for each term, \u03c9^{2k} is \u03c9^{2k mod 13}. But I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} f(\u03c9^k) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^13 - 1. But I'm not entirely sure how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product over all roots \u03b1 of another polynomial g(x) of f(\u03b1) is equal to the resultant of f and g. So, in this case, g(x) is x^13 - 1, and f(x) is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nThe resultant of two polynomials f and g is the product of f(\u03b2) for each root \u03b2 of g. So yes, that's exactly what we're looking for. So, Resultant(f, g) = \u03a0_{\u03b2: g(\u03b2)=0} f(\u03b2).\n\nSo, the product we're trying to compute is Resultant(f, g), where f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 and g(x) = x^13 - 1.\n\nBut how do I compute the resultant? I think one way is using the formula involving determinants of the Sylvester matrix, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using properties of resultants.\n\nWait, another idea: the resultant of f and g is equal to the product of f evaluated at each root of g. Since g(x) = x^13 -1, which has roots \u03c9^k for k=0 to 12. So, the resultant is indeed \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} f(\u03c9^k), which is our product.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that the resultant can be computed as the product of f(\u03c9^k) for each root \u03c9^k of g(x). So, yes, that's the same as our product.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to compute this directly. Maybe another approach: since f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, let's consider the polynomial h(x) = f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Then, the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} h(\u03c9^k) is equal to the product over all 13th roots of unity of h(\u03c9^k).\n\nI think there's a formula that relates this product to the value of the resultant, which can also be expressed in terms of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of f and g. But since f is degree 2 and g is degree 13, and 13 is prime, their GCD is 1 if f doesn't divide g, which I think is the case here.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can use another method: using complex numbers. Since \u03c9^k are all the 13th roots of unity, the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) can be expressed as the product over all \u03c9^k of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2) = \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{k})^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the minimal polynomial. Since \u03c9 is a root of x^13 - 1 = 0, but also of the cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that helps yet. Let's think about f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Let me compute f(\u03c9^k):\n\nf(\u03c9^k) = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2.\n\nSo the product is \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nWait, maybe I can factor this as \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{k} - a)(\u03c9^{k} - b), where a and b are the roots of f(x)=0. Since f(x) = (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)), then yes, so the product becomes \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1+i))(\u03c9^k - (1-i)).\n\nWhich is equal to \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) * \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1-i)).\n\nNow, each of these products is the product of (\u03c9^k - c) for c = 1+i and c=1-i, where \u03c9^k runs through all 13th roots of unity.\n\nWait, but the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) is equal to x^13 -1, because the roots are exactly the 13th roots of unity.\n\nSo, for c = 1+i, \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = c^13 -1, because substituting x = c into x^13 -1 gives c^13 -1, which is equal to \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k).\n\nSimilarly, for c = 1-i, \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = c^13 -1.\n\nTherefore, the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - c) = (-1)^13 * \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = - (c^13 -1).\n\nWait, because \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - c) = (-1)^13 \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = - (c^13 -1).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n\u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) = - [ (1+i)^13 - 1 ]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1-i)) = - [ (1-i)^13 - 1 ]\n\nSo the total product is:\n\n[ - ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1-i)^13 -1 ) ] = ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1-i)^13 -1 )\n\nSo now, I need to compute (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13, then subtract 1 from each, and multiply them together.\n\nLet's compute (1+i)^13 first.\n\nWe know that 1+i can be expressed in polar form. The magnitude is sqrt(2), and the angle is \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, 1+i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the angle 13\u03c0/4. Let's reduce this modulo 2\u03c0:\n\n13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0). So, e^{i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1) = -e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-e^{i\u03c0/4}) = -64 * sqrt(2) * (cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)).\n\nCompute cos(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = -64 * sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = -64 * sqrt(2) * [ (1 + i)/sqrt(2) ) ].\n\nSimplify sqrt(2) * (1 + i)/sqrt(2) = (1 + i).\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = -64 * (1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, compute (1-i)^13.\n\n1 - i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nAgain, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nAngle: -13\u03c0/4. Let's add multiples of 2\u03c0 to get it in [0, 2\u03c0). \n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So, e^{-i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i *3\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i *3\u03c0/4}.\n\ne^{i *3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nSimplify sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1, and same for the imaginary part.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * [ (-1) + i (1) ) ] = 64*(-1 + i).\n\nWait, let me check that step again:\n\nWait, 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nCompute each term:\n\nsqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2) i = (2)/2 i = i.\n\nSo, the expression becomes 64 * ( -1 + i ) = 64*(-1 + i).\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64*(-1 + i).\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64*(1 + i) = -64 -64i.\n\n(1 - i)^13 = 64*(-1 + i) = -64 +64i.\n\nNow, subtract 1 from each:\n\n(1 + i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\n(1 - i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nNow, multiply these two complex numbers together:\n\n(-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i).\n\nThis is of the form (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, where a = -65 and b = 64i.\n\nWait, no, actually, a = 65 and b = 64i, but signs:\n\nWait, let me compute it properly:\n\n(-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(-65)^2 = 4225.\n\n(64i)^2 = (64)^2 * i\u00b2 = 4096 * (-1) = -4096.\n\nSo, the product is 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, let me compute 4225 + 4096:\n\n4225 + 4096: 4000 + 4000 = 8000, 225 + 96 = 321. So total 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but earlier steps had me compute \u03a0 P_k = ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1-i)^13 -1 ) = 8321.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that \u03a0 (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) = - [ (1+i)^13 -1 ] and same for (1 - i). So when I multiplied those two, I got [ - ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1-i)^13 -1 ) ] = ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1-i)^13 -1 ) = 8321.\n\nSo the product \u03a0 P_k is 8321.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 8321 is a positive integer, but let me confirm:\n\nWait, 8321 is correct? Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nCompute (1 + i)^13:\n\nWe found it's -64*(1 + i) = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is 64*(-1 + i) = -64 +64i.\n\nSubtract 1:\n\n(1 + i)^13 -1 = -65 -64i.\n\n(1 - i)^13 -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nNow, multiply them:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096*(-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but the problem is to compute this product modulo 1000. So, 8321 mod 1000.\n\nCompute 8321 / 1000 = 8 * 1000 = 8000, remainder 321.\n\nSo 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, another thought: when I expressed the product as \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) * (\u03c9^k - (1-i)), and then used the fact that \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 -1, so \u03a0 (\u03c9^k - c) = (-1)^13 (c^13 -1) = -(c^13 -1).\n\nSo, yes, that step is correct.\n\nTherefore, the product is indeed 8321, which mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, the answer is 321.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when dealing with polynomials. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation \u03c9^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure yet how that will help here.\n\nThe product is over all k from 0 to 12, so that's all the 13th roots of unity, including \u03c9^0 = 1. Each term in the product is of the form 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me denote this term as P_k = 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}.\n\nI need to compute the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} P_k. Since \u03c9^k runs through all 13th roots of unity as k goes from 0 to 12, maybe there's a way to relate this product to a polynomial evaluated at certain points.\n\nWait, another thought: since the product is over all k, maybe it's equivalent to evaluating some polynomial at specific values and then taking the product of those evaluations. Let's see.\n\nLet me consider the polynomial f(x) = 2 - 2x + x\u00b2. Then, each P_k is f(\u03c9^k). So the product becomes \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} f(\u03c9^k). \n\nBut since \u03c9^k are all the 13th roots of unity, this product is the product of f evaluated at each 13th root of unity. I remember that for a polynomial, the product over all roots can be related to its value at certain points.\n\nWait, more precisely, if I have a polynomial Q(x) of degree n, then the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{n-1} Q(\u03c9^k) is equal to the resultant of Q(x) and x^n - 1, or something like that. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the product over all (x - \u03c9^k) is x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1.\n\nBut in this case, I'm evaluating a different polynomial f(x) at each \u03c9^k and taking the product. So, perhaps I can use the formula that says \u03a0_{k=0}^{n-1} Q(\u03c9^k) = \u03a0_{k=0}^{n-1} Q(e^{2\u03c0ik/n}) }, which might relate to the resultant or something else.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that if Q(x) is a polynomial, then the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{n-1} Q(\u03c9^k) is equal to the resultant of Q(x) and x^n - 1, which is the same as the product of Q evaluated at each root of x^n - 1. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, another approach: if f(x) = 2 - 2x + x\u00b2, then f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Let me see if this factors or relates to any cyclotomic polynomials.\n\nLet me compute the discriminant of f(x). The discriminant D = b\u00b2 - 4ac = ( -2 )\u00b2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots of f(x) are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So the roots are 1 + i and 1 - i, which are 8th roots of unity? Wait, no. Let me compute their magnitudes.\n\nThe magnitude of 1 + i is sqrt(2), so they're not roots of unity. Hmm, maybe that's a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write f(x) as x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 and relate it to the minimal polynomials over the cyclotomic field.\n\nWait, another idea: the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} f(\u03c9^k) can be thought of as the product over all 13th roots of unity of f(\u03c9^k). So, if I think of f(x) as a polynomial, then the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} f(\u03c9^k) is equal to the product of f(\u03c9^k) for each \u03c9^k, which are the roots of x^13 - 1 = 0. So, maybe this relates to the value of the resultant or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the product of f(\u03c9^k) for all k is equal to the product of f(\u03c9^k) over k=0 to 12, which is the same as the product over all roots of x^13 - 1 of f(x). \n\nWait, maybe using the formula that the product of Q(\u03b1) over all roots \u03b1 of a polynomial P(x) is equal to the resultant of P and Q, up to some sign or power. Alternatively, another approach: since f(x) is a quadratic, perhaps I can consider the product as the product of f(\u03c9^k) over all \u03c9^k, which is the same as the product over all \u03c9^k of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nWait, maybe I can express 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} in another way. Let me factor that expression:\n\n2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2.\n\nHmm, maybe factor out \u03c9^k? Let's see:\n\n= \u03c9^k (\u03c9^k - 2) + 2.\n\nNot sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps write it as \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. Maybe factor this quadratic in \u03c9^k:\n\nLet me treat \u03c9^k as a variable, say z. Then the expression becomes z\u00b2 - 2z + 2. So f(z) = z\u00b2 - 2z + 2.\n\nThen, the product over all k=0 to 12 of f(\u03c9^k) is \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nWait, another thought: since \u03c9^13 = 1, then \u03c9^{k+13} = \u03c9^k. So, for each term, \u03c9^{2k} is \u03c9^{2k mod 13}. But I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} f(\u03c9^k) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^13 - 1. But I'm not entirely sure how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product over all roots \u03b1 of another polynomial g(x) of f(\u03b1) is equal to the resultant of f and g. So, in this case, g(x) is x^13 - 1, and f(x) is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nThe resultant of two polynomials f and g is the product of f(\u03b2) for each root \u03b2 of g. So yes, that's exactly what we're looking for. So, Resultant(f, g) = \u03a0_{\u03b2: g(\u03b2)=0} f(\u03b2).\n\nSo, the product we're trying to compute is Resultant(f, g), where f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 and g(x) = x^13 - 1.\n\nBut how do I compute the resultant? I think one way is using the formula involving determinants of the Sylvester matrix, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using properties of resultants.\n\nWait, another idea: the resultant of f and g is equal to the product of f evaluated at each root of g. Since g(x) = x^13 -1, which has roots \u03c9^k for k=0 to 12. So, the resultant is indeed \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} f(\u03c9^k), which is our product.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that the resultant can be computed as the product of f(\u03c9^k) for each root \u03c9^k of g(x). So, yes, that's the same as our product.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to compute this directly. Maybe another approach: since f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, let's consider the polynomial h(x) = f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Then, the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} h(\u03c9^k) is equal to the product over all 13th roots of unity of h(\u03c9^k).\n\nI think there's a formula that relates this product to the value of the resultant, which can also be expressed in terms of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of f and g. But since f is degree 2 and g is degree 13, and 13 is prime, their GCD is 1 if f doesn't divide g, which I think is the case here.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can use another method: using complex numbers. Since \u03c9^k are all the 13th roots of unity, the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) can be expressed as the product over all \u03c9^k of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2) = \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{k})^2 - 2\u03c9^k + 2.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the minimal polynomial. Since \u03c9 is a root of x^13 - 1 = 0, but also of the cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that helps yet. Let's think about f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Let me compute f(\u03c9^k):\n\nf(\u03c9^k) = \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2.\n\nSo the product is \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nWait, maybe I can factor this as \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{k} - a)(\u03c9^{k} - b), where a and b are the roots of f(x)=0. Since f(x) = (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)), then yes, so the product becomes \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1+i))(\u03c9^k - (1-i)).\n\nWhich is equal to \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) * \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1-i)).\n\nNow, each of these products is the product of (\u03c9^k - c) for c = 1+i and c=1-i, where \u03c9^k runs through all 13th roots of unity.\n\nWait, but the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) is equal to x^13 -1, because the roots are exactly the 13th roots of unity.\n\nSo, for c = 1+i, \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = c^13 -1, because substituting x = c into x^13 -1 gives c^13 -1, which is equal to \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k).\n\nSimilarly, for c = 1-i, \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = c^13 -1.\n\nTherefore, the product \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - c) = (-1)^13 * \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = - (c^13 -1).\n\nWait, because \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - c) = (-1)^13 \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (c - \u03c9^k) = - (c^13 -1).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n\u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) = - [ (1+i)^13 - 1 ]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1-i)) = - [ (1-i)^13 - 1 ]\n\nSo the total product is:\n\n[ - ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1-i)^13 -1 ) ] = ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1-i)^13 -1 )\n\nSo now, I need to compute (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13, then subtract 1 from each, and multiply them together.\n\nLet's compute (1+i)^13 first.\n\nWe know that 1+i can be expressed in polar form. The magnitude is sqrt(2), and the angle is \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, 1+i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the angle 13\u03c0/4. Let's reduce this modulo 2\u03c0:\n\n13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0). So, e^{i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1) = -e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-e^{i\u03c0/4}) = -64 * sqrt(2) * (cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)).\n\nCompute cos(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = -64 * sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = -64 * sqrt(2) * [ (1 + i)/sqrt(2) ) ].\n\nSimplify sqrt(2) * (1 + i)/sqrt(2) = (1 + i).\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = -64 * (1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, compute (1-i)^13.\n\n1 - i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nAgain, (sqrt(2))^13 = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nAngle: -13\u03c0/4. Let's add multiples of 2\u03c0 to get it in [0, 2\u03c0). \n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So, e^{-i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i *3\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i *3\u03c0/4}.\n\ne^{i *3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nSimplify sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1, and same for the imaginary part.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * [ (-1) + i (1) ) ] = 64*(-1 + i).\n\nWait, let me check that step again:\n\nWait, 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].\n\nCompute each term:\n\nsqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2) i = (2)/2 i = i.\n\nSo, the expression becomes 64 * ( -1 + i ) = 64*(-1 + i).\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64*(-1 + i).\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64*(1 + i) = -64 -64i.\n\n(1 - i)^13 = 64*(-1 + i) = -64 +64i.\n\nNow, subtract 1 from each:\n\n(1 + i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\n(1 - i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nNow, multiply these two complex numbers together:\n\n(-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i).\n\nThis is of the form (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, where a = -65 and b = 64i.\n\nWait, no, actually, a = 65 and b = 64i, but signs:\n\nWait, let me compute it properly:\n\n(-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(-65)^2 = 4225.\n\n(64i)^2 = (64)^2 * i\u00b2 = 4096 * (-1) = -4096.\n\nSo, the product is 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, let me compute 4225 + 4096:\n\n4225 + 4096: 4000 + 4000 = 8000, 225 + 96 = 321. So total 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but earlier steps had me compute \u03a0 P_k = ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1-i)^13 -1 ) = 8321.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that \u03a0 (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) = - [ (1+i)^13 -1 ] and same for (1 - i). So when I multiplied those two, I got [ - ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1-i)^13 -1 ) ] = ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1-i)^13 -1 ) = 8321.\n\nSo the product \u03a0 P_k is 8321.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 8321 is a positive integer, but let me confirm:\n\nWait, 8321 is correct? Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nCompute (1 + i)^13:\n\nWe found it's -64*(1 + i) = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is 64*(-1 + i) = -64 +64i.\n\nSubtract 1:\n\n(1 + i)^13 -1 = -65 -64i.\n\n(1 - i)^13 -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nNow, multiply them:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096*(-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but the problem is to compute this product modulo 1000. So, 8321 mod 1000.\n\nCompute 8321 / 1000 = 8 * 1000 = 8000, remainder 321.\n\nSo 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, another thought: when I expressed the product as \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1+i)) * (\u03c9^k - (1-i)), and then used the fact that \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 -1, so \u03a0 (\u03c9^k - c) = (-1)^13 (c^13 -1) = -(c^13 -1).\n\nSo, yes, that step is correct.\n\nTherefore, the product is indeed 8321, which mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, the answer is 321.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to compute the product \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, and then find its remainder modulo 1000.\n\n1. **Express the Product in Terms of a Polynomial:**\n   Let \\( f(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2 \\). Each term in the product is \\( f(\\omega^k) \\). Thus, the product becomes \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} f(\\omega^k) \\).\n\n2. **Use Properties of Roots of Unity:**\n   The product \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} f(\\omega^k) \\) can be expressed as \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) \\). This is equivalent to evaluating \\( f(x) \\) at each 13th root of unity and taking the product.\n\n3. **Factor the Polynomial:**\n   The polynomial \\( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) has roots \\( 1 + i \\) and \\( 1 - i \\). Therefore, the product can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\prod_{k=0}^{12} ( \\omega^k - (1+i) ) \\cdot \\prod_{k=0}^{12} ( \\omega^k - (1-i) )\n   \\]\n\n4. **Evaluate the Product Using Roots of Unity:**\n   Using the property that \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \\omega^k) = x^{13} - 1 \\), we find:\n   \\[\n   \\prod_{k=0}^{12} ( \\omega^k - c ) = (-1)^{13} (c^{13} - 1) = -(c^{13} - 1)\n   \\]\n   Applying this for \\( c = 1+i \\) and \\( c = 1-i \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   \\prod_{k=0}^{12} ( \\omega^k - (1+i) ) = -((1+i)^{13} - 1)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\prod_{k=0}^{12} ( \\omega^k - (1-i) ) = -((1-i)^{13} - 1)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compute \\( (1+i)^{13} \\) and \\( (1-i)^{13} \\):**\n   - \\( 1+i \\) in polar form is \\( \\sqrt{2}e^{i\\pi/4} \\), so \\( (1+i)^{13} = 64\\sqrt{2}e^{i13\\pi/4} = -64(1+i) \\).\n   - \\( 1-i \\) in polar form is \\( \\sqrt{2}e^{-i\\pi/4} \\), so \\( (1-i)^{13} = 64\\sqrt{2}e^{-i13\\pi/4} = -64(1-i) \\).\n\n6. **Subtract 1 and Multiply:**\n   - \\( (1+i)^{13} - 1 = -65 -64i \\)\n   - \\( (1-i)^{13} - 1 = -65 +64i \\)\n   - Their product is:\n     \\[\n     (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321\n     \\]\n\n7. **Find the Remainder Modulo 1000:**\n   The remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.\n\nThus, the remainder is \\(\\boxed{321}\\).",
