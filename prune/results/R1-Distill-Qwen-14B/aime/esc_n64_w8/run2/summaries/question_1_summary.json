      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)| given a system of logarithmic equations. Hmm, let's see. I remember that logarithms can be tricky, especially when dealing with multiple variables, but maybe I can simplify this by converting the log equations into exponential form. \n\nThe equations given are:\n\n1. log\u2082(x/(yz)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y/(xz)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z/(xy)) = 1/4\n\nI think the first step is to rewrite each equation in terms of exponents. That way, I can express x, y, and z in some relation. Let me recall that log\u2082(a) = b is equivalent to a = 2\u1d47. So applying that:\n\n1. x/(yz) = 2^(1/2) \u2192 x = yz * \u221a2\n2. y/(xz) = 2^(1/3) \u2192 y = xz * 2^(1/3)\n3. z/(xy) = 2^(1/4) \u2192 z = xy * 2^(1/4)\n\nHmm, so now I have three equations:\n\nx = yz * \u221a2      ...(1)\ny = xz * 2^(1/3) ...(2)\nz = xy * 2^(1/4) ...(3)\n\nThis seems a bit circular, but maybe I can substitute one equation into another to find expressions for each variable in terms of another.\n\nLet me try substituting equation (1) into equation (2). So equation (2) says y = xz * 2^(1/3). But from equation (1), x = yz\u221a2. So substituting x into equation (2):\n\ny = (yz\u221a2) * z * 2^(1/3)\n\nLet me write that out:\n\ny = y z\u00b2 \u221a2 * 2^(1/3)\n\nSimplify the exponents: \u221a2 is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) = 2^(1/2 + 1/3). Let me compute 1/2 + 1/3. That's (3 + 2)/6 = 5/6. So 2^(5/6).\n\nSo now, y = y z\u00b2 * 2^(5/6)\n\nHmm, let's divide both sides by y (assuming y \u2260 0, which it is positive, so that's okay):\n\n1 = z\u00b2 * 2^(5/6)\n\nSo z\u00b2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) \u2192 z\u00b2 = 2^(-5/6)\n\nTaking square roots, z = 2^(-5/12) because sqrt(2^(-5/6)) is 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we don't have to worry about the negative root.\n\nOkay, so z = 2^(-5/12). Got that.\n\nNow, let me find z in terms of x and y. Wait, but I just found z, so maybe I can plug this back into one of the equations to find y or x.\n\nLet me go back to equation (3): z = xy * 2^(1/4)\n\nBut we know z is 2^(-5/12), so:\n\n2^(-5/12) = xy * 2^(1/4)\n\nLet me solve for xy:\n\nxy = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) because 1/4 is 3/12. So that's 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo xy = 2^(-2/3)\n\nHmm, okay, so xy = 2^(-2/3). Let me note that.\n\nNow, let's look at equation (1): x = yz * \u221a2. I know z, so substitute z in:\n\nx = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2)\n\nBecause \u221a2 is 2^(1/2). So 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(-5/12 + 6/12) = 2^(1/12)\n\nSo x = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nSo x = y * 2^(1/12). Let me write that as equation (4): x = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nNow, since I have x in terms of y, and I have xy = 2^(-2/3), I can substitute x from equation (4) into xy:\n\n(y * 2^(1/12)) * y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo y\u00b2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nLet me solve for y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12)\n\nCompute the exponents: -2/3 is -8/12, so -8/12 -1/12 = -9/12 = -3/4\n\nSo y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4)\n\nTaking square roots: y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nSince y is positive, we take the positive root.\n\nSo y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nNow, with y known, I can find x using equation (4):\n\nx = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12)\n\nCombine exponents: -3/8 + 1/12. Let me find a common denominator, which is 24.\n\n-3/8 = -9/24; 1/12 = 2/24. So total is (-9 + 2)/24 = -7/24\n\nThus, x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nSo now I have:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nLet me double-check these to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with equation (1): x = yz * \u221a2\n\nyz = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-3/8 -5/12)\n\nConvert to 24 denominator: -9/24 -10/24 = -19/24\n\nSo yz = 2^(-19/24)\n\nMultiply by \u221a2: 2^(-19/24) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(-19/24 + 12/24) = 2^(-7/24) which is equal to x. Okay, that checks out.\n\nEquation (2): y = xz * 2^(1/3)\n\nxz = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-7/24 -10/24) = 2^(-17/24)\n\nMultiply by 2^(1/3) = 2^(8/24): 2^(-17/24 +8/24)=2^(-9/24)=2^(-3/8)=y. Good.\n\nEquation (3): z = xy * 2^(1/4)\n\nxy = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-7/24 -9/24)=2^(-16/24)=2^(-2/3)\n\nMultiply by 2^(1/4)=2^(6/24): 2^(-2/3 +1/4)=2^(-8/12 +3/12)=2^(-5/12)=z. Perfect.\n\nSo all equations are satisfied. Now, the question is to find |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)|.\n\nLet me compute the exponent first: x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2.\n\nExpressed in terms of exponents of 2:\n\nx\u2074 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)\n\ny\u00b3 = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)\n\nz\u00b2 = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiply all together:\n\nx\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)\n\nLet me add the exponents:\n\nConvert all to 24 denominators:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nAdding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8\n\nSo x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8)\n\nThus, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = -25/8\n\nThe absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8\n\nSo the value is 25/8, where m=25 and n=8. They are coprime since 25 is 5\u00b2 and 8 is 2\u00b3, no common factors.\n\nTherefore, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.\n",

From the first equation: log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2 \u21d2 x / (y z) = 2^(1/2) = \u221a2\n2. From the second equation: log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3 \u21d2 y / (x z) = 2^(1/3) \u2248 cube root of 2\n3.

I think I can solve for x, y, z by substitution or elimination.\n\nLet me denote the equations for clarity:\n\nEquation (1): x = \u221a2 y z\nEquation (2): y = 2^(1/3) x z\nEquation (3): z = 2^(1/4) x y\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express each variable in terms of the others and then substitute.\n\nWait, but each equation expresses one variable in terms of the product of the other two variables multiplied by a power of 2. Maybe I can multiply all three equations together.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nMultiply the left sides: x * y * z\n\nMultiply the right sides: \u221a2 y z * 2^(1/3) x z * 2^(1/4) x y\n\nSo, x y z = [\u221a2 * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4)] * [y z * x z * x y]\n\nLet me compute the constants first. \u221a2 is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4) = 2^(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4)\n\nLet me compute the exponent: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4.\n\nConvert to a common denominator, which is 12.\n\n1/2 = 6/12, 1/3 = 4/12, 1/4 = 3/12. So total is (6 + 4 + 3)/12 = 13/12.\n\nSo the constants multiply to 2^(13/12).\n\nNow the right side's variable terms: [y z * x z * x y] = (y z) * (x z) * (x y) = x^2 y^2 z^2.\n\nSo, putting it together: x y z = 2^(13/12) * x^2 y^2 z^2\n\nLet me rearrange this equation. Divide both sides by x y z (assuming x, y, z \u2260 0, which they aren't since they're positive reals):\n\n1 = 2^(13/12) * x y z\n\nSo, x y z = 1 / 2^(13/12) = 2^(-13/12)\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So the product x y z is 2^(-13/12). That might be useful later.\n\nNow, maybe I can express each variable in terms of x y z.\n\nWait, let me think. I have expressions for x, y, z in terms of the others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can take the three equations and express x, y, z in terms of each other, then substitute.\n\nLet me try expressing each variable as follows:\n\nFrom equation (1): x = \u221a2 y z\n\nFrom equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) x z\n\nFrom equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) x y\n\nSo, substitute x from equation (1) into equation (2):\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * (\u221a2 y z) * z\n\nSimplify that: y = 2^(1/3) * \u221a2 * y z^2\n\nWait, let me compute 2^(1/3) * \u221a2. Since \u221a2 is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6)\n\nSo equation (2) becomes y = 2^(5/6) y z^2\n\nHmm, so let's write that as:\n\ny = 2^(5/6) y z^2\n\nIf I subtract y from both sides, but wait, that would complicate things. Alternatively, divide both sides by y (since y \u2260 0):\n\n1 = 2^(5/6) z^2\n\nSo, z^2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nTaking square roots, since z is positive:\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nWait, because 2^(-5/6) is the same as (2^(-5/12))^2, so square root is 2^(-5/12).\n\nSo, z = 2^(-5/12). Got that.\n\nNow that I have z, maybe I can substitute back into equation (3) to find y or x.\n\nEquation (3) is z = 2^(1/4) x y\n\nWe know z is 2^(-5/12), so:\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) x y\n\nExpress 2^(1/4) as 2^(3/12) to have a common denominator with 2^(-5/12).\n\nWait, 1/4 is 3/12, and -5/12 is as is.\n\nSo, 2^(3/12) x y = 2^(-5/12)\n\nDivide both sides by 2^(3/12):\n\nx y = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, x y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nHmm, that's equation (4): x y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nNow, let's go back to equation (1): x = \u221a2 y z\n\nWe know z is 2^(-5/12), so let's substitute that in.\n\nx = \u221a2 * y * 2^(-5/12)\n\nSimplify \u221a2 as 2^(1/2):\n\nx = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 - 5/12)\n\nCompute 1/2 - 5/12: 6/12 -5/12 = 1/12\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nSo, equation (5): x = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nNow, from equation (4): x y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSubstitute x from equation (5) into equation (4):\n\n(y * 2^(1/12)) * y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSimplify: y^2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nDivide both sides by 2^(1/12):\n\ny^2 = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12) = 2^(- (8/12 + 1/12)) )= 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nTake square roots:\n\ny = 2^(-3/8)\n\nSince y is positive.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nNow, from equation (5): x = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12)\n\nCompute the exponents:\n\n-3/8 + 1/12. Let's find a common denominator, which is 24.\n\n-3/8 = -9/24, 1/12 = 2/24. So total is (-9 + 2)/24 = -7/24\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nWait, let me double-check that exponent calculation.\n\nWait, (-3/8) + (1/12) = (-9/24) + (2/24) = (-7/24). Yes, correct.\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nNow, we have x, y, z in terms of exponents of 2:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nLet me write all exponents with denominator 24 to make it easier.\n\n-7/24 is as is.\n\n-3/8 = -9/24\n\n-5/12 = -10/24\n\nSo:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-9/24)\nz = 2^(-10/24)\n\nSimplify:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24)\nz = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|.\n\nLet me compute the exponent first.\n\nx\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = (2^(-7/24))^4 * (2^(-9/24))^3 * (2^(-10/24))^2\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/24 * 4) = 2^(-7/6)\n(2^(-9/24))^3 = 2^(-9/24 * 3) = 2^(-9/8)\n(2^(-10/24))^2 = 2^(-10/24 * 2) = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nNow, multiply these together:\n\n2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)\n\nFirst, let me combine the exponents:\n\nLet's convert all to 24 denominators.\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n-9/8 = -27/24\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nSo total exponent is (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify -75/24: divide numerator and denominator by 3: -25/8.\n\nSo, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8)\n\nTherefore, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = -25/8\n\nTaking absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8\n\nSo the value is 25/8. Now, 25 and 8 are coprime since 25 is 5\u00b2 and 8 is 2\u00b3. So m=25, n=8, m + n = 33.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify the calculations once more to be sure.\n\nFirst, I converted each log equation into its exponential form correctly.\n\nThen, when I multiplied all three equations, I got x y z = 2^(-13/12). Then, solving for z, I found z = 2^(-5/12). Then, substituted into equation (3) to find x y, which gave me 2^(-2/3). Then, using equation (1), substituted z into x expression, leading to x in terms of y, then substituted into x y = 2^(-2/3) to find y = 2^(-3/8). Then, x = y * 2^(1/12) gave x = 2^(-7/24). Then, z was already known.\n\nThen, computing x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2: each exponent was correctly calculated as -7/6, -9/8, -5/6. Summing these exponents: (-7/6 -9/8 -5/6) converted to 24 denominators:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, -5/6 = -20/24. Sum: -28-27-20= -75, over 24. So exponent is -75/24, which simplifies to -25/8.\n\nThus, log\u2082 is -25/8, absolute value 25/8, which is 25/8 reduced, so m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.\n\nI think that all checks out. So the answer is 33.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)| given a system of logarithmic equations. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the given equations:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nAnd I need to find |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)|, which is the absolute value of the logarithm base 2 of x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2.\n\nAlright, so logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can convert these log equations into their exponential forms to make them easier to handle.\n\nRemember that log\u2082(A) = B is equivalent to A = 2^B.\n\nLet me apply that to each equation.\n\n1. From the first equation: log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2 \u21d2 x / (y z) = 2^(1/2) = \u221a2\n2. From the second equation: log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3 \u21d2 y / (x z) = 2^(1/3) \u2248 cube root of 2\n3. From the third equation: log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4 \u21d2 z / (x y) = 2^(1/4) = fourth root of 2\n\nSo now I have three equations:\n\n1. x = \u221a2 * y z\n2. y = 2^(1/3) * x z\n3. z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nHmm, this looks like a system of equations with three variables. I think I can solve for x, y, z by substitution or elimination.\n\nLet me denote the equations for clarity:\n\nEquation (1): x = \u221a2 y z\nEquation (2): y = 2^(1/3) x z\nEquation (3): z = 2^(1/4) x y\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express each variable in terms of the others and then substitute.\n\nWait, but each equation expresses one variable in terms of the product of the other two variables multiplied by a power of 2. Maybe I can multiply all three equations together.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nMultiply the left sides: x * y * z\n\nMultiply the right sides: \u221a2 y z * 2^(1/3) x z * 2^(1/4) x y\n\nSo, x y z = [\u221a2 * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4)] * [y z * x z * x y]\n\nLet me compute the constants first. \u221a2 is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4) = 2^(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4)\n\nLet me compute the exponent: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4.\n\nConvert to a common denominator, which is 12.\n\n1/2 = 6/12, 1/3 = 4/12, 1/4 = 3/12.

Now, 25 and 8 are coprime since 25 is 5\u00b2 and 8 is 2\u00b3. So m=25, n=8, m + n = 33.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify the calculations once more to be sure.\n\nFirst, I converted each log equation into its exponential form correctly.\n\nThen, when I multiplied all three equations, I got x y z = 2^(-13/12). Then, solving for z, I found z = 2^(-5/12). Then, substituted into equation (3) to find x y, which gave me 2^(-2/3). Then, using equation (1), substituted z into x expression, leading to x in terms of y, then substituted into x y = 2^(-2/3) to find y = 2^(-3/8). Then, x = y * 2^(1/12) gave x = 2^(-7/24). Then, z was already known.\n\nThen, computing x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2: each exponent was correctly calculated as -7/6, -9/8, -5/6. Summing these exponents: (-7/6 -9/8 -5/6) converted to 24 denominators:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, -5/6 = -20/24. Sum: -28-27-20= -75, over 24. So exponent is -75/24, which simplifies to -25/8.\n\nThus, log\u2082 is -25/8, absolute value 25/8, which is 25/8 reduced, so m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.\n\nI think that all checks out. So the answer is 33.\n\n\nGiven the system of equations:\n\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}, \\quad \\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4},\n\\]\n\nwe convert each to exponential form:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}, \\quad \\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}, \\quad \\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}.\n\\]\n\nMultiplying these equations together:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{yz} \\cdot \\frac{y}{xz} \\cdot \\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4}.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side gives \\(1\\), and the right side exponent:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{6}{12} + \\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{13}{12}.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(1 = 2^{13/12} \\cdot (xyz)\\), leading to:\n\n\\[\nxyz = 2^{-13/12}.\n\\]\n\nNext, solving for each variable:\n\n1.

Substituting \\(z\\) back, we find \\(x = 2^{-7/24}\\) and \\(y = 2^{-3/8}\\).\n\nFinally, compute \\(x^4 y^3 z^2\\):\n\n\\[\nx^4 y^3 z^2 = (2^{-7/24})^4 \\cdot (2^{-3/8})^3 \\cdot (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6} = 2^{-25/8}.\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n\\left|\\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\\right| = \\left| -\\frac{25}{8} \\right| = \\frac{25}{8}.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(25\\) and \\(8\\) are coprime, \\(m = 25\\) and \\(n = 8\\), giving \\(m + n = 33\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{33}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Then, I have to find m + n. The given system of equations involves logarithms, so I think I'll need to manipulate these equations to find expressions for x, y, z or maybe find a relationship between them.\n\nLet me write down the equations again:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nHmm, since these are logarithms with base 2, I can convert them into exponential form to make them easier to handle. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.\n\nSo, for the first equation:\n\nlog\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2 \u21d2 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)\n\nSimilarly for the others:\n\n2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)\n3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)\n\nSo now I have three equations:\n\n1. x = 2^(1/2) * y z\n2. y = 2^(1/3) * x z\n3. z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nHmm, these look a bit interdependent. Maybe I can express all variables in terms of one variable, say x, and then solve for x.\n\nLet me try substituting. From equation 1: x = sqrt(2) * y z. Let me keep that in mind.\n\nFrom equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) * x z. But x is expressed in terms of y and z, so I can substitute that in.\n\nSo, substitute x from equation 1 into equation 2:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * (sqrt(2) * y z) * z\n\nLet me compute that step by step. First, expand the right side:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2) * y * z * z\ny = 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) * y * z\u00b2\n\nBecause sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2). So multiplying the exponents:\n\n2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6). So,\n\ny = 2^(5/6) * y * z\u00b2\n\nNow, let's bring all terms to one side. Subtract 2^(5/6) * y * z\u00b2 from both sides:\n\ny - 2^(5/6) y z\u00b2 = 0\n\nFactor out y:\n\ny (1 - 2^(5/6) z\u00b2) = 0\n\nSince y is a positive real number, it can't be zero. So,\n\n1 - 2^(5/6) z\u00b2 = 0 \u21d2 2^(5/6) z\u00b2 = 1 \u21d2 z\u00b2 = 1 / 2^(5/6)\n\nTaking square roots:\n\nz = 1 / 2^(5/12) because square of z is 2^(-5/6), so z = 2^(-5/12)\n\nWait, let me check that exponent:\n\nIf z\u00b2 = 2^(-5/6), then z = 2^(-5/12). Yes, because (2^(-5/12))\u00b2 = 2^(-5/6). So, z = 2^(-5/12)\n\nAlright, so now I have z in terms of exponents. Let me write that down:\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nNow, let's go back to equation 1: x = 2^(1/2) * y z\n\nI can substitute z here:\n\nx = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12)\n\nMultiplying the exponents:\n\n2^(1/2 - 5/12) = 2^( (6/12 - 5/12) ) = 2^(1/12)\n\nSo,\n\nx = 2^(1/12) * y\n\nSo, x is 2^(1/12) times y. Let me write that as equation 4:\n\n4. x = 2^(1/12) y\n\nNow, let's go to equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nWe have z = 2^(-5/12), so substitute that in:\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nExpress 2^(1/4) as 2^(3/12) for easier combination with other exponents.\n\nSo,\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(3/12) * x y\n\nDivide both sides by 2^(3/12):\n\n2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = x y\n\nWhich is:\n\n2^(-8/12) = x y \u21d2 2^(-2/3) = x y\n\nBut from equation 4, x = 2^(1/12) y. Substitute x into this:\n\n2^(-2/3) = (2^(1/12) y) * y = 2^(1/12) y\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\n2^(-2/3) = 2^(1/12) y\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by 2^(1/12):\n\n2^(-2/3 - 1/12) = y\u00b2\n\nCompute the exponent:\n\n-2/3 is -8/12, so -8/12 - 1/12 = -9/12 = -3/4.\n\nSo,\n\n2^(-3/4) = y\u00b2\n\nTake square roots:\n\ny = 2^(-3/8)\n\nAgain, since y is positive, we take the positive root.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nNow that I have y, I can find x from equation 4:\n\nx = 2^(1/12) * y = 2^(1/12) * 2^(-3/8)\n\nCombine the exponents:\n\n1/12 - 3/8. Let me convert to 24ths:\n\n1/12 = 2/24, 3/8 = 9/24.\n\nSo,\n\n2^(2/24 - 9/24) = 2^(-7/24)\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nSo now, we have expressions for x, y, z in terms of exponents:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nLet me write them with common denominators to check:\n\n-7/24 is already in 24ths.\n-3/8 = -9/24\n-5/12 = -10/24\n\nSo,\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-9/24)\nz = 2^(-10/24)\n\nHmm, that might help in the next step.\n\nNow, I need to find log\u2082(x^4 y^3 z^2). Let's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute x^4, y^3, z^2:\n\nx^4 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)\ny^3 = (2^(-9/24))^3 = 2^(-27/24) = 2^(-9/8)\nz^2 = (2^(-10/24))^2 = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nNow, multiply them all together:\n\nx^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)\n\nAdding the exponents:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nFirst, convert all to 24ths:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n-9/8 = -27/24\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nSo total exponent:\n\n-28/24 -27/24 -20/24 = (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify: -75/24 = -25/8\n\nSo, x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-25/8)\n\nTaking log base 2 of that:\n\nlog\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8\n\nBut the problem asks for the absolute value, so | -25/8 | = 25/8\n\nSo, the value is 25/8, where m=25, n=8. They are coprime because 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1.\n\nSo, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponents.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nWe had:\n\nlog\u2082(x/(y z)) = 1/2 \u2192 x = 2^(1/2) y z\n\nSimilarly for the others. Then through substitution, I found z = 2^(-5/12), y = 2^(-3/8), x = 2^(-7/24). Let me verify these satisfy the original equations.\n\nCheck equation 1: log\u2082(x/(y z)).\n\nCompute x/(y z):\n\nx = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)\n\nSo, y z = 2^(-9/24) * 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-19/24)\n\nThen x/(y z) = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(-19/24) = 2^(-7/24 +19/24) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2)\n\nSo, log\u2082(2^(1/2)) = 1/2, which matches the first equation. Good.\n\nEquation 2: log\u2082(y/(x z)).\n\nCompute y/(x z):\n\ny = 2^(-9/24), x z = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-17/24)\n\nSo, y/(x z) = 2^(-9/24) / 2^(-17/24) = 2^(-9/24 +17/24) = 2^(8/24) = 2^(1/3)\n\nlog\u2082(2^(1/3)) = 1/3. Correct.\n\nEquation 3: log\u2082(z/(x y)).\n\nz/(x y) = 2^(-10/24) / (2^(-7/24) * 2^(-9/24)) = 2^(-10/24) / 2^(-16/24) = 2^(-10/24 +16/24) = 2^(6/24) = 2^(1/4)\n\nlog\u2082(2^(1/4)) = 1/4. Correct.\n\nSo all three original equations are satisfied. Therefore, my values for x, y, z are correct.\n\nThus, the value of |log\u2082(x^4 y^3 z^2)| is 25/8, so m + n is 33.\n",

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem gives me three equations:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nI remember that log\u2082(a/b) = log\u2082a - log\u2082b. So maybe I can rewrite each equation using this property. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\nlog\u2082(x) - log\u2082(y) - log\u2082(z) = 1/2\n\nSecond equation:\nlog\u2082(y) - log\u2082(x) - log\u2082(z) = 1/3\n\nThird equation:\nlog\u2082(z) - log\u2082(x) - log\u2082(y) = 1/4\n\nHmm, okay, so now I have a system of three equations with three variables: log\u2082x, log\u2082y, log\u2082z. Let me denote these as variables to make it easier. Let's say:\n\nLet a = log\u2082x\nb = log\u2082y\nc = log\u2082z\n\nSo substituting these into the equations, I get:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nNow I have a system of linear equations:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nI need to solve for a, b, and c. Let's see. Maybe I can add or subtract these equations to eliminate variables.\n\nLet me try adding Equation 1 and Equation 2 together:\n\n( a - b - c ) + ( -a + b - c ) = (1/2) + (1/3)\nSimplify:\na - a cancels, -b + b cancels, and -c - c = -2c\nSo, -2c = 1/2 + 1/3\n\nLet me compute 1/2 + 1/3. The common denominator is 6, so 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6. So:\n\n-2c = 5/6\nDivide both sides by -2:\nc = (5/6) / (-2) = -5/12\n\nSo c = -5/12. That's log\u2082z = -5/12. Hmm, okay.\n\nNow, let me try another combination. Maybe add Equation 1 and Equation 3:\n\n( a - b - c ) + ( -a - b + c ) = (1/2) + (1/4)\nSimplify:\na - a cancels, -b - b = -2b, -c + c cancels\nSo, -2b = 3/4\n\nThus, -2b = 3/4. So b = (3/4) / (-2) = -3/8\n\nSo b = -3/8. That's log\u2082y = -3/8.\n\nNow, I have c and b. Let me plug these back into one of the original equations to find a. Let's use Equation 1:\n\na - b - c = 1/2\n\nSubstituting b = -3/8 and c = -5/12:\n\na - (-3/8) - (-5/12) = 1/2\n\nSimplify:\na + 3/8 + 5/12 = 1/2\n\nI need to add 3/8 and 5/12. Let's find a common denominator, which is 24.\n\n3/8 = 9/24, and 5/12 = 10/24. So 9/24 + 10/24 = 19/24.\n\nSo, a + 19/24 = 1/2\n\nConvert 1/2 to 12/24:\n\na + 19/24 = 12/24\n\nSubtract 19/24 from both sides:\n\na = (12/24 - 19/24) = (-7)/24\n\nSo a = -7/24. That's log\u2082x = -7/24.\n\nWait, let me double-check these results to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me plug a, b, c back into all three equations.\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = (-7/24) - (-3/8) - (-5/12)\nCompute each term:\n\n-7/24 remains as is.\n\n- (-3/8) is +3/8.\n\n- (-5/12) is +5/12.\n\nSo, (-7/24) + 3/8 + 5/12\n\nConvert all to 24 denominators:\n\n-7/24 + 9/24 + 10/24 = (-7 + 9 +10)/24 = 12/24 = 1/2. Correct.\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = -(-7/24) + (-3/8) - (-5/12)\n\nWhich is 7/24 - 3/8 +5/12.\n\nConvert to 24 denominators:\n\n7/24 - 9/24 + 10/24 = (7 -9 +10)/24 = 8/24 = 1/3. Correct.\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = -(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12)\n\nWhich is 7/24 +3/8 -5/12.\n\nConvert to 24 denominators:\n\n7/24 +9/24 -10/24 = (7 +9 -10)/24 = 6/24 = 1/4. Correct.\n\nAlright, so the values are correct.\n\nSo now, we have:\n\na = log\u2082x = -7/24\nb = log\u2082y = -3/8\nc = log\u2082z = -5/12\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)|.\n\nLet me compute log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) first. Using logarithm properties:\n\nlog\u2082(x\u2074) + log\u2082(y\u00b3) + log\u2082(z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z\n\nSubstituting a, b, c:\n\n4a + 3b + 2c = 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6\n\n3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8\n\n2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6\n\nSo adding them together:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nLet me find a common denominator here. The denominators are 6, 8, 6. The least common multiple is 24.\n\nConvert each term:\n\n-7/6 = (-28)/24\n\n-9/8 = (-27)/24\n\n-5/6 = (-20)/24\n\nAdding them up:\n\n(-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify: -75/24. Let's see if this can be reduced. Both divided by 3: 75/3=25, 24/3=8. So -25/8.\n\nSo log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = -25/8. The absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms since 25 and 8 are coprime.\n\nThus, m =25, n=8. So m +n= 25 +8=33.\n\nWait, did I compute everything correctly? Let me check.\n\n4a: 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6. Correct.\n\n3b: 3*(-3/8)= -9/8. Correct.\n\n2c: 2*(-5/12)= -10/12 = -5/6. Correct.\n\nAdding: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, -5/6 = -20/24.\n\nTotal: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the absolute value is 25/8, so m+n=33.\n",

This substitution might make the equations easier to handle.\n\nSo, rewriting the given equations using these variables:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n   Using logarithm properties, this can be written as log\u2082x - log\u2082y - log\u2082z = 1/2\n   Which translates to a - b - c = 1/2.\n\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n   Similarly, log\u2082y - log\u2082x - log\u2082z = 1/3\n   Which becomes -a + b - c = 1/3.\n\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n   Again, log\u2082z - log\u2082x - log\u2082y = 1/4\n   Which is -a - b + c = 1/4.\n\nSo now, I have a system of three linear equations:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nI need to solve for a, b, and c. Let me write them out:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nHmm, this is a system of three equations with three variables. I can solve this using elimination or substitution. Let me try elimination.\n\nFirst, perhaps adding all three equations together to see if that simplifies things.\n\nAdding Equation 1 + Equation 2 + Equation 3:\n\n(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4\n\nLet's compute the left side:\n\na - b - c -a + b - c -a - b + c\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\na - a -a = -a\n-b + b - b = -b\n-c - c + c = -c\n\nSo overall, the left side is -a - b - c.\n\nThe right side is 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Let me compute that.\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 12.\n\n1/2 = 6/12\n1/3 = 4/12\n1/4 = 3/12\n\nAdding them together: 6 + 4 + 3 = 13, so 13/12.\n\nSo, -a - b - c = 13/12.\n\nLet me write that as Equation 4:\n\nEquation 4: -a - b - c = 13/12\n\nHmm, interesting. Now, let's see if I can express the original equations in terms of combinations that can help me find a, b, c.\n\nLooking back at the original equations:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nAnd Equation 4: -a - b - c = 13/12\n\nWait, maybe I can use Equation 4 with the other equations to solve for each variable.\n\nLet me try adding Equation 1 and Equation 4:\n\nEquation 1 + Equation 4: (a - b - c) + (-a - b - c) = 1/2 + 13/12\n\nLeft side: a -a -b -b -c -c = -2b -2c\n\nRight side: 1/2 is 6/12, so 6/12 +13/12 = 19/12\n\nSo, -2b -2c = 19/12\n\nDivide both sides by -2: b + c = (19/12)/(-2) = -19/24\n\nLet me note that as Equation 5: b + c = -19/24\n\nSimilarly, let's add Equation 2 and Equation 4:\n\nEquation 2 + Equation 4: (-a + b - c) + (-a - b - c) = 1/3 +13/12\n\nLeft side: -a -a +b -b -c -c = -2a -2c\n\nRight side: 1/3 is 4/12, so 4/12 +13/12 =17/12\n\nSo, -2a -2c =17/12\n\nDivide by -2: a + c = (17/12)/(-2) = -17/24\n\nEquation 6: a + c = -17/24\n\nNow, add Equation 3 and Equation 4:\n\nEquation 3 + Equation 4: (-a - b + c) + (-a - b - c) =1/4 +13/12\n\nLeft side: -a -a -b -b +c -c = -2a -2b\n\nRight side: 1/4 is 3/12, so 3/12 +13/12=16/12=4/3\n\nSo, -2a -2b =4/3\n\nDivide by -2: a + b= (4/3)/(-2)= -2/3\n\nEquation 7: a + b = -2/3\n\nNow, I have three new equations:\n\nEquation 5: b + c = -19/24\n\nEquation 6: a + c = -17/24\n\nEquation 7: a + b = -2/3\n\nNow, I can try to solve for a, b, c using these.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\n5. b + c = -19/24\n\n6. a + c = -17/24\n\n7. a + b = -2/3\n\nHmm, maybe I can subtract equations to find the differences.\n\nFrom Equation 5 and Equation 6:\n\nEquation 6: a + c = -17/24\n\nEquation 5: b + c = -19/24\n\nSubtract Equation 5 from Equation 6:\n\n(a + c) - (b + c) = (-17/24) - (-19/24)\n\nSimplify left: a - b\n\nRight: (-17 +19)/24 = 2/24=1/12\n\nSo, a - b = 1/12\n\nBut from Equation 1: a - b - c =1/2\n\nWait, but maybe I can use this.\n\nWait, Equation 7 is a + b = -2/3.\n\nSo, I have:\n\nEquation 7: a + b = -2/3\n\nAnd from above, a - b =1/12\n\nSo, now I can solve for a and b.\n\nLet me write:\n\nEquation 7: a + b = -2/3\n\nEquation 8: a - b =1/12\n\nNow, adding these two equations:\n\nEquation 7 + Equation 8: (a + b) + (a - b) = (-2/3) + (1/12)\n\nLeft: 2a\n\nRight: (-8/12 + 1/12) = (-7/12)\n\nSo, 2a = -7/12 => a = (-7/12)/2 = -7/24\n\nSo, a = -7/24\n\nNow, substitute a into Equation 7: a + b = -2/3\n\nSo, (-7/24) + b = -2/3\n\nCompute -2/3 as -16/24.\n\nSo, (-7/24) + b = -16/24\n\nSo, b = (-16/24) + (7/24) = (-9/24) = -3/8\n\nSo, b = -3/8\n\nNow, with a and b known, we can find c from Equation 6: a + c = -17/24\n\nSo, a is -7/24, so:\n\n-7/24 + c = -17/24\n\nThus, c = (-17/24) +7/24 = (-10)/24 = -5/12\n\nSo, c = -5/12\n\nWait, let me verify these values in the original equations.\n\nCompute a = -7/24, b= -3/8, c= -5/12\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = (-7/24) - (-3/8) - (-5/12)\n\nConvert all to 24 denominators:\n\n-7/24 +9/24 +10/24 = (-7 +9 +10)/24 =12/24=1/2. Correct.\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c =7/24 + (-9/24) - (-10/24)=7/24 -9/24 +10/24=8/24=1/3. Correct.\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c=7/24 - (-9/24) + (-10/24)=7/24 +9/24 -10/24=6/24=1/4. Correct.\n\nAll equations check out. So, a = log\u2082x = -7/24, so x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nSimilarly, log\u2082y = b = -3/8, so y=2^(-3/8)\n\nAnd log\u2082z = c= -5/12, so z=2^(-5/12)\n\nNow, the expression we need is |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|\n\nLet me compute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082x +3 log\u2082y +2 log\u2082z\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n4*(-7/24) +3*(-3/8) +2*(-5/12)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6\n\n3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8\n\n2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6\n\nSo, summing them up:\n\n(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nFirst, combine the terms with denominator 6:\n\n(-7/6) + (-5/6) = (-12)/6 = -2\n\nSo, total expression is -2 + (-9/8) = (-16/8) -9/8= (-25)/8\n\nSo, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = -25/8\n\nThe absolute value is | -25/8 | =25/8\n\nSo, the value is 25/8, which is m/n where m=25 and n=8, which are coprime.\n\nTherefore, m +n=25+8=33\n",

I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.\n\nHmm, let's write down the equations first to get a clear picture.\n\nThe equations are:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nSo, these are logarithms base 2. Since logs can be tricky, maybe I can convert these into exponential form to make them easier to handle.\n\nRemember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.\n\nApplying that here:\n\n1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)\n2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)\n3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)\n\nSo, that gives me three equations:\n\n1. x = 2^(1/2) * y z\n2. y = 2^(1/3) * x z\n3. z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nHmm, these are nonlinear equations because x, y, z are multiplied together.

Yes, correct.\n\nSo, z = 2^(-5/12).\n\nOkay, so now I have z in terms of exponents. Let me write that down.\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nNow, let's go back to equation 1: x = sqrt(2) * y z.\n\nWe can express x in terms of y and z, but since I have z, perhaps I can express x in terms of y.\n\nBut maybe it's better to find a relation between x, y, and z.\n\nWait, equation 3 is z = (2^(1/4)) * x y.\n\nSince I know z is 2^(-5/12), let's plug that into equation 3.\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nSo, x y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, x y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nHmm, okay. So, now I have x y = 2^(-2/3).\n\nFrom equation 1: x = 2^(1/2) * y z.\n\nWe know z is 2^(-5/12), so x = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 -5/12)\n\nCompute the exponent: 1/2 is 6/12, so 6/12 -5/12 = 1/12.\n\nThus, x = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nNow, since x y = 2^(-2/3), substitute x:\n\n(y * 2^(1/12)) * y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nWhich is y^2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, y^2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 -1/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nTherefore, y^2 = 2^(-3/4), so y = 2^(-3/8), since square root of 2^(-3/4) is 2^(-3/8).\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\nsqrt(2^(-3/4)) = (2^(-3/4))^(1/2) = 2^(-3/8).

That should simplify things.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nNow I have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c.

So now I have three equations with variables log\u2082x, log\u2082y, and log\u2082z. Maybe I can let a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z. That should simplify things.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nNow I have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c. I can solve this system.\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2  --> Equation (1)\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3 --> Equation (2)\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4 --> Equation (3)\n\nI can try adding all three equations together to see if that helps. Let's see:\n\nEquation (1) + Equation (2) + Equation (3):\n\n(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\na - a - a - b + b - b - c - c + c\n\nSo that's (-a) + (-b) + (-c) = - (a + b + c)\n\nRight side: Let's compute 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4.\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 12:\n\n(6/12) + (4/12) + (3/12) = 13/12\n\nSo:\n\n- (a + b + c) = 13/12\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\na + b + c = -13/12 --> Let's call this Equation (4)\n\nNow I can use Equation (4) along with the original equations to solve for a, b, c.\n\nLet me take Equation (1): a - b - c = 1/2\n\nFrom Equation (4), I can express a as:\n\na = (-13/12) - b - c\n\nWait, no, Equation (4) is a + b + c = -13/12, so a = -13/12 - b - c.\n\nWait, but maybe a better approach is to solve the system step by step. Let me subtract some equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use substitution or elimination.\n\nLet me try adding Equation (1) and Equation (2):\n\nEquation (1): a - b - c = 1/2\n\nEquation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nAdding them:\n\n(a - a) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 1/2 + 1/3\n\nSimplify:\n\n0 + 0 - 2c = 5/6\n\nSo -2c = 5/6 \u2192 c = -5/12\n\nOkay, so c is found: c = -5/12\n\nNow, let's plug c back into Equation (4):\n\na + b + c = -13/12\n\nSo a + b + (-5/12) = -13/12\n\nThus, a + b = (-13/12) + 5/12 = (-8)/12 = -2/3\n\nSo a + b = -2/3 --> Equation (5)\n\nNow, let's take Equation (1): a - b - c = 1/2\n\nWe know c is -5/12, so:\n\na - b - (-5/12) = 1/2 \u2192 a - b + 5/12 = 1/2\n\nSubtract 5/12:\n\na - b = 1/2 - 5/12 = (6/12 - 5/12) = 1/12\n\nSo a - b = 1/12 --> Equation (6)\n\nNow, from Equation (5): a + b = -2/3\n\nEquation (6): a - b = 1/12\n\nWe can solve these two equations.\n\nAdding Equation (5) and Equation (6):\n\n(a + b) + (a - b) = (-2/3) + (1/12)\n\nSimplify:\n\n2a = (-8/12 + 1/12) = (-7/12)\n\nSo 2a = -7/12 \u2192 a = -7/24\n\nNow, from Equation (5): a + b = -2/3\n\nWe have a = -7/24, so:\n\n-7/24 + b = -2/3\n\nConvert -2/3 to -16/24:\n\n-7/24 + b = -16/24 \u2192 b = (-16/24 + 7/24) = (-9/24) = -3/8\n\nSo b = -3/8\n\nSo now we have a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12\n\nWait, let me confirm these values.\n\nLet me check Equation (3): -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nPlugging in a, b, c:\n\n-(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12) = ?\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-(-7/24) = 7/24\n\n-(-3/8) = 3/8\n\n+ (-5/12) = -5/12\n\nSo sum: 7/24 + 3/8 -5/12\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n7/24 + 9/24 -10/24 = (7 +9 -10)/24 = 6/24 = 1/4\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a = log\u2082x = -7/24\n\nb = log\u2082y = -3/8\n\nc = log\u2082z = -5/12\n\nNow, the question is to find |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)|\n\nLet me compute log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z\n\nWhich is 4a + 3b + 2c\n\nPlugging in a, b, c:\n\n4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6\n\n3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8\n\n2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6\n\nSo sum:\n\n(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nCombine terms:\n\nFirst, combine (-7/6) and (-5/6) = (-12/6) = -2\n\nSo now, -2 + (-9/8) = ?\n\nConvert to eighths:\n\n-2 = -16/8\n\nSo, -16/8 -9/8 = -25/8\n\nSo log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = -25/8\n\nThe absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8\n\nSo m is 25, n is 8, which are coprime.\n\nSo m + n = 25 + 8 = 33\n\n\nThe value of $\\left|\\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\\right|$ is $\\tfrac{25}{8}$. Therefore, $m + n = 25 + 8 = 33$.\n\n\\boxed{33}",

Let me try to unpack it step by step. \n\nThe problem states that x, y, and z are positive real numbers, and they satisfy a system of three logarithmic equations. The goal is to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2), which will be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nAlright, let's write down the equations first to have them clear:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nHmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite each of these equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\nlog\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\nThis means that 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)\nWhich simplifies to sqrt(2) = x / (y z)\nSo, x = sqrt(2) * y * z   ... (1)\n\nSimilarly, the second equation:\nlog\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\nWhich means 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)\nSo, y = 2^(1/3) * x * z   ... (2)\n\nAnd the third equation:\nlog\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\nSo, 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)\nTherefore, z = 2^(1/4) * x * y   ... (3)\n\nNow, I have three equations:\n\nx = sqrt(2) * y * z   (1)\ny = 2^(1/3) * x * z   (2)\nz = 2^(1/4) * x * y   (3)\n\nHmm, these are all interconnected. It looks like a system of equations where each variable is expressed in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute these into each other to find the values of x, y, z.\n\nLet me see. Let's try substituting equation (2) into equation (1). So equation (1) is x = sqrt(2) * y * z, and equation (2) is y = 2^(1/3) * x * z. So if I plug y from equation (2) into equation (1), I get:\n\nx = sqrt(2) * [2^(1/3) * x * z] * z\nSimplify that:\nx = sqrt(2) * 2^(1/3) * x * z\u00b2\n\nWait, let's compute sqrt(2) * 2^(1/3). Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) = 2^(1/2 + 1/3) = 2^(5/6). So that becomes:\n\nx = 2^(5/6) * x * z\u00b2\n\nHmm, okay, so now I have x on both sides. Let's divide both sides by x (since x is positive, it's not zero, so division is allowed):\n\n1 = 2^(5/6) * z\u00b2\n\nSo, z\u00b2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nTaking square roots (since z is positive):\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)   because sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12)\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Square root of 2^(-5/6) is 2^(-5/6 * 1/2) = 2^(-5/12). Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo z is 2^(-5/12). Let's write that as equation (4):\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)  ... (4)\n\nAlright, now that I have z, maybe I can substitute back into equation (3) to find y or x.\n\nLooking at equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x * y\n\nWe have z from equation (4), so plug that in:\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * x * y\n\nLet me solve for x * y:\n\nx * y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) because 1/4 is 3/12.\n\nWait, 1/4 is 3/12? No, 1/4 is 3/12? Wait, 3/12 is 1/4, yes. So:\n\nx * y = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, x * y = 2^(-2/3)   ... (5)\n\nNow, let's look at equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x * z\n\nWe know z from equation (4), so let's plug that in:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * x * 2^(-5/12)\n\nSimplify the exponents: 1/3 is 4/12, so 4/12 -5/12 = (-1)/12.\n\nThus, y = 2^(4/12 -5/12) * x = 2^(-1/12) * x\n\nSo, y = x * 2^(-1/12)   ... (6)\n\nNow, from equation (5): x * y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nAnd from equation (6), y = x * 2^(-1/12), so substituting into equation (5):\n\nx * (x * 2^(-1/12)) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nWhich simplifies to x\u00b2 * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3 + 1/12)\n\nConvert -2/3 to twelfths: -2/3 = -8/12, so:\n\n-8/12 + 1/12 = (-7)/12\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 2^(-7/12)\n\nTherefore, x = sqrt(2^(-7/12)) = 2^(-7/24)\n\nWait, because sqrt(a) is a^(1/2), so (2^(-7/12))^(1/2) = 2^(-7/24). Yes.\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24)  ... (7)\n\nNow, from equation (6): y = x * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-1/12)\n\nConvert 1/12 to 24ths: 2/24.\n\nSo, exponents: -7/24 -2/24 = -9/24 = -3/8\n\nThus, y = 2^(-3/8)  ... (8)\n\nNow, we have x, y, z in terms of exponents of 2, which is good because the final expression is also a logarithm base 2, so it might simplify nicely.\n\nSo, let's recap:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nLet me write these exponents as fractions over 24 to make it easier:\n\nx: -7/24\n\ny: -3/8 = -9/24\n\nz: -5/12 = -10/24\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-10/24)\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)|\n\nLet's compute that expression.\n\nFirst, compute the product inside the log:\n\nx\u2074 * y\u00b3 * z\u00b2\n\nExpressed in terms of exponents of 2:\n\n(2^(-7/24))\u2074 * (2^(-9/24))\u00b3 * (2^(-10/24))\u00b2\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n(2^(-7/24 * 4)) = 2^(-7/6)\n(2^(-9/24 * 3)) = 2^(-9/8)\n(2^(-10/24 * 2)) = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiply them together:\n\n2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)\n\nAdd the exponents:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nFirst, find a common denominator. 6 and 8 have 24 as LCD.\n\nConvert each fraction:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n-9/8 = -27/24\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nAdding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify: -75/24 can be reduced by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -25/8\n\nSo, the product x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2 is 2^(-25/8)\n\nSo, log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8\n\nThe absolute value of that is | -25/8 | = 25/8\n\nSo, the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms since 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1.\n\nTherefore, m = 25 and n = 8, so m + n = 33.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the exponents:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24), so x\u2074 is (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/6)\n\ny = 2^(-3/8), so y\u00b3 is (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)\n\nz = 2^(-5/12), so z\u00b2 is (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-5/6)\n\nAdding exponents: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nCompute:\n\nConvert to 24ths:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nTotal: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = -25/8, absolute value is 25/8. So m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.\n\nI think that's correct.\n",

(8)\n\nNow, we have x, y, z in terms of exponents of 2, which is good because the final expression is also a logarithm base 2, so it might simplify nicely.\n\nSo, let's recap:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nLet me write these exponents as fractions over 24 to make it easier:\n\nx: -7/24\n\ny: -3/8 = -9/24\n\nz: -5/12 = -10/24\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-10/24)\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)|\n\nLet's compute that expression.\n\nFirst, compute the product inside the log:\n\nx\u2074 * y\u00b3 * z\u00b2\n\nExpressed in terms of exponents of 2:\n\n(2^(-7/24))\u2074 * (2^(-9/24))\u00b3 * (2^(-10/24))\u00b2\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n(2^(-7/24 * 4)) = 2^(-7/6)\n(2^(-9/24 * 3)) = 2^(-9/8)\n(2^(-10/24 * 2)) = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiply them together:\n\n2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)\n\nAdd the exponents:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nFirst, find a common denominator. 6 and 8 have 24 as LCD.\n\nConvert each fraction:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n-9/8 = -27/24\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nAdding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify: -75/24 can be reduced by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -25/8\n\nSo, the product x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2 is 2^(-25/8)\n\nSo, log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8\n\nThe absolute value of that is | -25/8 | = 25/8\n\nSo, the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms since 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1.\n\nTherefore, m = 25 and n = 8, so m + n = 33.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the exponents:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24), so x\u2074 is (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/6)\n\ny = 2^(-3/8), so y\u00b3 is (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)\n\nz = 2^(-5/12), so z\u00b2 is (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-5/6)\n\nAdding exponents: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nCompute:\n\nConvert to 24ths:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nTotal: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = -25/8, absolute value is 25/8. So m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by converting each logarithmic equation into its exponential form:\n\n1. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\) implies \\(x = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot yz\\).\n2. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\) implies \\(y = 2^{1/3} \\cdot xz\\).\n3. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\) implies \\(z = 2^{1/4} \\cdot xy\\).\n\nSubstituting these into each other, we find:\n\n- From equations (1) and (2), we derive \\(z = 2^{-5/12}\\).\n- Using \\(z\\) in equation (3), we find \\(x \\cdot y = 2^{-2/3}\\).\n- Substituting \\(y = x \\cdot 2^{-1/12}\\) into \\(x \\cdot y\\), we solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n  - \\(x = 2^{-7/24}\\)\n  - \\(y = 2^{-3/8}\\)\n\nFinally, we compute \\(\\left|\\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\\right|\\):\n\n- Express \\(x^4y^3z^2\\) in terms of powers of 2:\n  - \\(x^4 = 2^{-7/6}\\)\n  - \\(y^3 = 2^{-9/8}\\)\n  - \\(z^2 = 2^{-5/6}\\)\n- Combine the exponents: \\(-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6 = -25/8\\).\n- Thus, \\(\\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = -25/8\\), and its absolute value is \\(25/8\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(m = 25\\) and \\(n = 8\\), giving \\(m + n = 33\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{33}\\)",
