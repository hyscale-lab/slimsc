      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 give Bob a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, let's see. So, it's a turn-based game with two possible moves each turn: take 1 or 4 tokens. The key is to figure out for which n Bob can force a win. Since Alice goes first, Bob can only win if the starting position is a losing position for Alice. So, the idea is to find all n where Alice is in a losing position, meaning whatever she does, Bob can respond in a way that leads to his victory.\n\nI think I need to model this using the concept of winning and losing positions. A position is losing if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a position is winning if there's at least one move that forces the opponent into a losing position.\n\nLet's try to list out the positions starting from n=0 upwards and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nn=0: Well, if there are no tokens left, the game is over. But since the last person to take a token wins, n=0 would mean the previous player has won. So, for n=0, the current player can't make a move and thus loses. So, n=0 is a losing position.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, n is the number of tokens at the start. So maybe n=0 isn't part of the problem, but it's a useful reference point for our analysis.\n\nLet's start with n=1. Alice can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice, meaning Bob can't win here.\n\nn=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take that 1 and win. Wait, no, because if Alice takes 1 from n=2, there's 1 left, Bob takes it and wins. So Alice would not want to do that. Alternatively, can Alice take 4 tokens? No, because there's only 2. So she can only take 1, which leads to her loss. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob. Wait, no, wait. If n=2 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is, then since Alice is starting, if n=2 is losing, Alice can't win, so Bob can force a win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So n=2 is a winning position for Bob.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nLet me define the positions as P-positions (previous player can force a win) and N-positions (next player can force a win). Wait, no, more accurately, P-positions are losing positions for the current player, and N-positions are winning. So, for n=0, since no move can be made, the current player loses, so n=0 is a P-position.\n\nFor n=1: current player can take 1, leaving 0 for the opponent, who then loses. So n=1 is an N-position.\n\nn=2: current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who is then in an N-position. Wait, but if the current player leaves the opponent in an N-position, meaning the opponent can win, that's bad for the current player. So if all moves from n=2 lead to N-positions, then n=2 is a P-position. So, for n=2, if the current player takes 1, opponent gets n=1, which is N, meaning opponent can win. So the current player would lose. So n=2 is a P-position. So Bob can win here.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's think about it again. If n=2, Alice's options are to take 1, leaving 1, which is an N-position for Bob. So Bob can then take that 1 and win. So Alice, if she takes 1, Bob can win. But Alice can't take 4, so she has no other option. So for n=2, Alice has no winning moves, so she loses. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. So n=2 is a P-position.\n\nn=3: Alice can take 1, leaving 2, which is a P-position for Bob. So Bob is now in a losing position, meaning Alice can win. So n=3 is an N-position.\n\nn=4: Alice can take 1, leaving 3 (N-position for Bob), or take 4, leaving 0 (P-position for Bob). Wait, if Alice takes 4 from n=4, she takes the last token and wins. So n=4 is an N-position.\n\nn=5: Let's see. Alice can take 1, leaving 4 (N-position) for Bob. Or she can take 4, leaving 1 (N-position) for Bob. So in both cases, Bob is in an N-position, meaning he can win. So wait, does that mean n=5 is a P-position? Because all moves from n=5 leave Bob in an N-position, so Bob can win. So Alice can't force a win from n=5, so Bob can win. So n=5 is a P-position.\n\nWait, but wait, when n=5, Alice can take 1, leaving 4, which is an N-position. So Bob, when faced with n=4, can win. So that would mean that Alice is leaving Bob in a position where he can win. So if n=5 is a P-position, that would mean that the current player (Alice) cannot force a win, so Bob can win.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me try to formalize it.\n\nLet me make a table:\n\nn | Position (P or N)\n0 | P\n1 | N (can take 1 to 0)\n2 | P (only move is to 1, which is N)\n3 | N (can take 1 to 2, which is P)\n4 | N (can take 4 to 0, which is P)\n5 | P (moves to 4 and 1, both N)\nWait, wait, n=5: if Alice takes 1, she leaves 4, which is N. So Bob can win from 4. So Alice would not want to do that. Alternatively, if she takes 4, she leaves 1, which is N, so Bob can take 1 and win. So both options for Alice leave Bob in a position where he can win. So n=5 is a P-position, meaning the current player (Alice) cannot win, so Bob can.\n\nn=6: Alice can take 1, leaving 5 (P-position), or take 4, leaving 2 (P-position). So if Alice takes 1, Bob is left with n=5, which is a P-position, meaning Bob can't win. So Alice can force Bob into a losing position by taking 1. So n=6 is an N-position.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, if n=6 is the starting point, and Alice can take 1 to leave 5 (P), which is a losing position for Bob. So Bob is in a P-position, meaning he can't win, so Alice can win. So n=6 is an N-position.\n\nn=7: Alice can take 1, leaving 6 (N), or take 4, leaving 3 (N). So both moves leave Bob in an N-position, which means Bob can win. So n=7 is a P-position.\n\nn=8: Alice can take 1, leaving 7 (P), or take 4, leaving 4 (N). So if she takes 1, Bob is left with 7 (P), which is a losing position for Bob. So Alice can choose to take 1 and force Bob into a losing position. So n=8 is an N-position.\n\nn=9: Alice can take 1, leaving 8 (N), or take 4, leaving 5 (P). So if she takes 4, she leaves Bob with 5 (P), which is a losing position. So Alice can force Bob to lose. So n=9 is an N-position.\n\nn=10: Alice can take 1, leaving 9 (N), or take 4, leaving 6 (N). So both options leave Bob in N-positions, which means Bob can win. So n=10 is a P-position.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For n=10, if Alice takes 1, Bob gets 9, which is N. Bob can then take 4, leaving 5 (P) for Alice. Then Alice is in a losing position. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4, leaving 6 (N) for Bob. Bob can take 1, leaving 5 (P) for Alice. So regardless of Alice's move, Bob can force Alice into a P-position. So yes, n=10 is a P-position.\n\nSo looking at the pattern so far:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nPos: P N P N N P N P N N P\n\nHmm, seems like every 5 positions, the pattern repeats? Let me check:\n\nn=0: P\n\nn=1: N\n\nn=2: P\n\nn=3: N\n\nn=4: N\n\nn=5: P\n\nn=6: N\n\nn=7: P\n\nn=8: N\n\nn=9: N\n\nn=10: P\n\nSo the pattern from n=0 is P, N, P, N, N, P, N, P, N, N, P,...\n\nWait, maybe the cycle is every 5. Let's see:\n\nn=0: P\n\nn=1: N\n\nn=2: P\n\nn=3: N\n\nn=4: N\n\nn=5: P\n\nn=6: N\n\nn=7: P\n\nn=8: N\n\nn=9: N\n\nn=10: P\n\nSo from n=0 to n=5, the pattern is P, N, P, N, N, P.\n\nThen n=5 to n=10: same pattern.\n\nSo the cycle seems to be every 5, with the pattern P, N, P, N, N.\n\nWait, so for n modulo 5:\n\nn mod 5 | Position\n0      | P\n1      | N\n2      | P\n3      | N\n4      | N\n\nYes, that seems to fit.\n\nSo for n=5k + r, where r=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nIf r=0: P\n\nr=1: N\n\nr=2: P\n\nr=3: N\n\nr=4: N\n\nSo, for n mod 5:\n\n0 \u2192 P\n\n1 \u2192 N\n\n2 \u2192 P\n\n3 \u2192 N\n\n4 \u2192 N\n\nSo, the losing positions (P) are when n mod 5 is 0 or 2.\n\nWait, let's check n=5: 5 mod5=0 \u2192 P\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2 \u2192 P\n\nn=7:7 mod5=2 \u2192 P\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0 \u2192 P\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2 \u2192 P\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the losing positions are when n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo for Bob to have a winning strategy, the starting position n must be a losing position for Alice, i.e., n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, but let me check for n=5, 7, 10, etc.\n\nWait, n=5: yes, P.\n\nn=7:7 mod5=2 \u2192 P.\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0 \u2192 P.\n\nSo, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, for n \u22642024, how many numbers are congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the numbers are of the form 5k and 5k+2.\n\nSo, the total count is the number of multiples of 5 up to 2024 plus the number of numbers \u22612 mod5 up to 2024.\n\nBut let's compute how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5 and \u22612 mod5.\n\nTotal numbers \u22610 mod5: floor(2024/5) = 404.8 \u2192 404 numbers. Because 5*404=2020, which is \u22642024.\n\nWait, 5*405=2025, which is >2024. So 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5: starting from 2,7,12,... up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nThe sequence is 2,7,12,..., let's find the last term.\n\nThe last term \u22642024: 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so 5*404=2020. 2020+2=2022, which is \u22642024. Next would be 2027, which is beyond. So the last term is 2022.\n\nSo the number of terms is (2022 -2)/5 +1 = (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nWait, let me check: the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d.\n\nHere, a_1=2, d=5.\n\nSo a_n=2 + (n-1)*5 \u22642024.\n\nWe can solve for n:\n\n2 +5(n-1) \u22642024\n\n5(n-1) \u22642022\n\nn-1 \u22642022/5=404.4 \u2192 n-1=404 \u2192 n=405.\n\nSo, 405 numbers.\n\nSo the total number of losing positions is 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5) = 809.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check for n=0. But n starts from 1, so n=0 isn't included. So, for the numbers \u22642024, the numbers \u22610 mod5 are 5,10,...,2020. So how many terms? 2020/5=404. So 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5: 2,7,12,...,2022. As calculated, 405 numbers.\n\nSo total is 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. Let's calculate 2024//5=404. So numbers \u22610 mod5: 5*1 up to 5*404=2020 \u2192 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5: starts at 2, ends at 2022. The count is (2022 -2)/5 +1 = (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo total is 404+405=809.\n\nSo the answer should be 809.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the pattern holds beyond n=10, because sometimes these games can have longer cycles.\n\nWait, for n=11: n=11 mod5=1 \u2192 N, so Alice can win.\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2 \u2192 P, so Bob can win.\n\nn=13:13 mod5=3 \u2192 N.\n\nn=14:14 mod5=4 \u2192 N.\n\nn=15:15 mod5=0 \u2192 P.\n\nYes, the pattern continues as P, N, P, N, N for each mod5.\n\nSo, the losing positions are indeed when n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo the total number of such n \u22642024 is 404 +405=809.\n",

So n=4 is an N-position.\n\nn=5: Let's see. Alice can take 1, leaving 4 (N-position) for Bob. Or she can take 4, leaving 1 (N-position) for Bob. So in both cases, Bob is in an N-position, meaning he can win. So wait, does that mean n=5 is a P-position? Because all moves from n=5 leave Bob in an N-position, so Bob can win.

So Alice can choose to take 1 and force Bob into a losing position. So n=8 is an N-position.\n\nn=9: Alice can take 1, leaving 8 (N), or take 4, leaving 5 (P). So if she takes 4, she leaves Bob with 5 (P), which is a losing position. So Alice can force Bob to lose. So n=9 is an N-position.\n\nn=10: Alice can take 1, leaving 9 (N), or take 4, leaving 6 (N). So both options leave Bob in N-positions, which means Bob can win. So n=10 is a P-position.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For n=10, if Alice takes 1, Bob gets 9, which is N. Bob can then take 4, leaving 5 (P) for Alice. Then Alice is in a losing position. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4, leaving 6 (N) for Bob. Bob can take 1, leaving 5 (P) for Alice. So regardless of Alice's move, Bob can force Alice into a P-position. So yes, n=10 is a P-position.\n\nSo looking at the pattern so far:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nPos: P N P N N P N P N N P\n\nHmm, seems like every 5 positions, the pattern repeats?

Let's see:\n\nn=0: P\n\nn=1: N\n\nn=2: P\n\nn=3: N\n\nn=4: N\n\nn=5: P\n\nn=6: N\n\nn=7: P\n\nn=8: N\n\nn=9: N\n\nn=10: P\n\nSo from n=0 to n=5, the pattern is P, N, P, N, N, P.\n\nThen n=5 to n=10: same pattern.\n\nSo the cycle seems to be every 5, with the pattern P, N, P, N, N.\n\nWait, so for n modulo 5:\n\nn mod 5 | Position\n0      | P\n1      | N\n2      | P\n3      | N\n4      | N\n\nYes, that seems to fit.\n\nSo for n=5k + r, where r=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nIf r=0: P\n\nr=1: N\n\nr=2: P\n\nr=3: N\n\nr=4: N\n\nSo, for n mod 5:\n\n0 \u2192 P\n\n1 \u2192 N\n\n2 \u2192 P\n\n3 \u2192 N\n\n4 \u2192 N\n\nSo, the losing positions (P) are when n mod 5 is 0 or 2.\n\nWait, let's check n=5: 5 mod5=0 \u2192 P\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2 \u2192 P\n\nn=7:7 mod5=2 \u2192 P\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0 \u2192 P\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2 \u2192 P\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the losing positions are when n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo for Bob to have a winning strategy, the starting position n must be a losing position for Alice, i.e., n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, but let me check for n=5, 7, 10, etc.\n\nWait, n=5: yes, P.\n\nn=7:7 mod5=2 \u2192 P.\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0 \u2192 P.\n\nSo, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, for n \u22642024, how many numbers are congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the numbers are of the form 5k and 5k+2.\n\nSo, the total count is the number of multiples of 5 up to 2024 plus the number of numbers \u22612 mod5 up to 2024.\n\nBut let's compute how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5 and \u22612 mod5.\n\nTotal numbers \u22610 mod5: floor(2024/5) = 404.8 \u2192 404 numbers. Because 5*404=2020, which is \u22642024.\n\nWait, 5*405=2025, which is >2024. So 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5: starting from 2,7,12,... up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nThe sequence is 2,7,12,..., let's find the last term.\n\nThe last term \u22642024: 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so 5*404=2020. 2020+2=2022, which is \u22642024. Next would be 2027, which is beyond. So the last term is 2022.\n\nSo the number of terms is (2022 -2)/5 +1 = (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nWait, let me check: the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d.\n\nHere, a_1=2, d=5.\n\nSo a_n=2 + (n-1)*5 \u22642024.\n\nWe can solve for n:\n\n2 +5(n-1) \u22642024\n\n5(n-1) \u22642022\n\nn-1 \u22642022/5=404.4 \u2192 n-1=404 \u2192 n=405.\n\nSo, 405 numbers.\n\nSo the total number of losing positions is 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5) = 809.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check for n=0. But n starts from 1, so n=0 isn't included. So, for the numbers \u22642024, the numbers \u22610 mod5 are 5,10,...,2020. So how many terms? 2020/5=404. So 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5: 2,7,12,...,2022. As calculated, 405 numbers.\n\nSo total is 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. Let's calculate 2024//5=404. So numbers \u22610 mod5: 5*1 up to 5*404=2020 \u2192 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5: starts at 2, ends at 2022. The count is (2022 -2)/5 +1 = (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo total is 404+405=809.\n\nSo the answer should be 809.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the pattern holds beyond n=10, because sometimes these games can have longer cycles.\n\nWait, for n=11: n=11 mod5=1 \u2192 N, so Alice can win.\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2 \u2192 P, so Bob can win.\n\nn=13:13 mod5=3 \u2192 N.\n\nn=14:14 mod5=4 \u2192 N.\n\nn=15:15 mod5=0 \u2192 P.\n\nYes, the pattern continues as P, N, P, N, N for each mod5.\n\nSo, the losing positions are indeed when n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo the total number of such n \u22642024 is 404 +405=809.\n\n\nAlice and Bob play a game with a stack of $n$ tokens, taking turns to remove 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first, and the player who takes the last token wins. To determine the number of $n \\leq 2024$ where Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game's winning and losing positions.\n\nA position is losing (P-position) if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a position is winning (N-position) if there's at least one move that forces the opponent into a losing position.\n\nBy examining the positions from $n=0$ upwards, we identify a repeating pattern every 5 positions:\n- $n \\equiv 0 \\mod 5$: P-position (losing for the current player)\n- $n \\equiv 1 \\mod 5$: N-position (winning)\n- $n \\equiv 2 \\mod 5$: P-position\n- $n \\equiv 3 \\mod 5$: N-position\n- $n \\equiv 4 \\mod 5$: N-position\n\nThus, Bob can force a win if $n \\equiv 0$ or $2 \\mod 5$.\n\nTo count such $n \\leq 2024$:\n- Numbers $\\equiv 0 \\mod 5$: $5, 10, \\dots, 2020$ \u2192 404 numbers.\n- Numbers $\\equiv 2 \\mod 5$: $2, 7, \\dots, 2022$ \u2192 405 numbers.\n\nTotal losing positions for Alice (and winning for Bob): $404 + 405 = 809$.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{809}$",

I need to figure out for how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, let's think about how these games usually work. It's a turn-based game with perfect information, so it's probably a variation of the classic Nim game or something similar. The key here is to find the losing positions for Alice, which would be the winning positions for Bob.\n\nWait, no. Since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position for the first player, then Bob can win. So I need to find all n where Alice cannot force a win, meaning Bob has a winning strategy.\n\nSo, let me try to model this. Let's consider small values of n and see who would win in each case.\n\nn = 1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Bob can't win here.\n\nn = 2: Alice takes 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob then takes that 1 and wins. Wait, so Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1 and wins. So Alice would lose if she takes 1. But wait, does Alice have another option? She can take 4 tokens, but n=2, so she can't. So she has to take 1, and then Bob takes the last one. So Bob can win when n=2.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if n=2, Alice takes 1, then Bob takes the last one and wins. So Bob can win when n=2. So n=2 is a winning position for Bob.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think in terms of P-positions and N-positions. P-positions are the losing positions for the player about to move, and N-positions are the winning ones.\n\nLet's start building up the positions.\n\nn=0: Well, if there are 0 tokens, the game is over, so the player to move loses. So n=0 is a losing position, a P-position.\n\nn=1: The player can take 1 token and win, so n=1 is an N-position.\n\nn=2: The player can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent. Since n=1 is an N-position (opponent can win), does that mean n=2 is a P-position? Wait, no. If you take 1 from n=2, leaving n=1, which is an N-position for the opponent. Wait, so n=2 is a P-position because whatever move you make, you leave the opponent in an N-position.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the way to think is, for each n, if there exists a move that leads the opponent into a P-position, then n is an N-position. If all moves lead to N-positions, then n is a P-position.\n\nSo starting with n=0 as P.\n\nn=1: You can take 1, leading to n=0 (P). So n=1 is N.\n\nn=2: Taking 1 leads to n=1 (N). Taking 4 isn't possible. So all moves from n=2 lead to N. So n=2 is P.\n\nn=3: Taking 1 leads to n=2 (P). So n=3 is N, because you can move to a P-position.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, if from n=3, taking 1 leaves n=2 (P), so the next player is in a losing position. So n=3 is N.\n\nn=4: You can take 1, leaving n=3 (N), or take 4, leaving n=0 (P). So since you can move to P, n=4 is N.\n\nn=5: Taking 1 leaves n=4 (N). Taking 4 leaves n=1 (N). Both moves lead to N, so n=5 is P.\n\nn=6: Taking 1 leaves n=5 (P). So n=6 is N, because you can move to P.\n\nn=7: Taking 1 leaves n=6 (N). Taking 4 leaves n=3 (N). So all moves from n=7 lead to N, so n=7 is P.\n\nn=8: Taking 1 leaves n=7 (P). So n=8 is N.\n\nn=9: Taking 1 leaves n=8 (N). Taking 4 leaves n=5 (P). So n=9 is N because you can move to P.\n\nn=10: Taking 1 leaves n=9 (N). Taking 4 leaves n=6 (N). So n=10 is P.\n\nHmm, I'm starting to see a pattern here.\n\nLet me list these out:\n\nn : Position (P or N)\n0 : P\n1 : N\n2 : P\n3 : N\n4 : N\n5 : P\n6 : N\n7 : P\n8 : N\n9 : N\n10: P\n11: ?\n\nWait, let's compute n=11.\n\nn=11: Taking 1 leaves n=10 (P), so n=11 is N.\n\nn=12: Taking 1 leaves n=11 (N). Taking 4 leaves n=8 (N). So n=12 is P.\n\nn=13: Taking 1 leaves n=12 (P), so n=13 is N.\n\nn=14: Taking 1 leaves n=13 (N). Taking 4 leaves n=10 (P). So n=14 is N because you can move to P.\n\nn=15: Taking 1 leaves n=14 (N). Taking 4 leaves n=11 (N). So n=15 is P.\n\nHmm, let's see the P positions so far: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,...\n\nWait, let's see the differences between P positions:\n\n2-0=2\n\n5-2=3\n\n7-5=2\n\n10-7=3\n\n12-10=2\n\n15-12=3\n\nSo it alternates between adding 2 and 3.\n\nSo the P positions are every 2, 3, 2, 3, etc. So starting from 0, adding 2 gives 2, then 2+3=5, 5+2=7, 7+3=10, 10+2=12, 12+3=15, 15+2=17, 17+3=20, and so on.\n\nSo the P positions are numbers congruent to 0 mod 5? Wait, let's check.\n\nWait, 0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25, etc.\n\nWait, 0 mod 5 is 0, 2 mod 5 is 2, 5 mod 5 is 0. No, that doesn't seem consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is adding 2 and 3 alternately. So starting from 0:\n\n0, +2=2, +3=5, +2=7, +3=10, +2=12, +3=15, etc.\n\nSo the sequence of P positions is 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27, etc.\n\nSo each P position is either 0 mod 5, 2 mod 5, 5 mod 5 (but 5 is 0 mod5), wait, no.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n0, 2, 5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,...\n\nLooking at mod 5:\n\n0: 0 mod5=0\n\n2: 2 mod5=2\n\n5:0\n\n7:2\n\n10:0\n\n12:2\n\n15:0\n\n17:2\n\n20:0\n\n22:2\n\n25:0\n\n27:2\n\nSo the P positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5? Wait, no, because 5 is 0 mod5, 7 is 2 mod5, 10 is 0 mod5, 12 is 2 mod5, etc.\n\nSo the P positions are the numbers n where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, let's check n=0: 0 mod5=0 \u2192 P.\n\nn=2:2 mod5=2 \u2192 P.\n\nn=5:5 mod5=0 \u2192 P.\n\nn=7:7 mod5=2 \u2192 P.\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0 \u2192 P.\n\nYes, that seems to hold. So if n \u22610 or 2 mod5, then it's a P position, meaning the current player cannot force a win, so the opponent can.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me test n=17:17 mod5=2 \u2192 P.\n\nn=17: Alice can take 1, leaving 16. 16 mod5=1 \u2192 N, so Bob can win from there. Or she can take 4, leaving 13, which is 3 mod5 \u2192 N. So yes, n=17 is P.\n\nSimilarly, n=22:22 mod5=2 \u2192 P. Alice can take 1, leaving 21 (21 mod5=1 \u2192 N). Or take4, leaving 18 (18 mod5=3 \u2192 N). So Bob can win. So 22 is P.\n\nSo the P positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5. So for those n, the current player cannot force a win, so if Alice is faced with such an n on her turn, Bob can win.\n\nWait, but in our problem, Alice goes first. So if n is a P position, Alice is in a losing position, meaning Bob can win. So the number of n \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, let me confirm with n=1:1 mod5=1 \u2192 N. Alice can take 1 and win. So correct, Bob can't win when n=1.\n\nn=2:2 mod5=2 \u2192 P. Alice can't win, so Bob can. Correct.\n\nn=3:3 mod5=3 \u2192 N. Alice can take 1, leaving 2 (P), so Bob loses. So correct.\n\nn=4:4 mod5=4 \u2192 N. Alice can take 4, leaving 0 (P), so Bob can't win. So correct.\n\nn=5:5 mod5=0 \u2192 P. Alice can take 1, leaving 4 (N), or take4, leaving1 (N). So Bob can win. So correct.\n\nSo yes, the P positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo the problem is to count the numbers \u22642024 that are \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo how many numbers \u22642024 are congruent to 0 mod5?\n\nThat's floor(2024/5) = 404 (since 5*404=2020, and 2020 is \u22642024). So 404 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5: The first is 2, then 7, 12,... up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nWhat's the largest number \u22642024 that is \u22612 mod5? Let's see: 2024 divided by5 is 404.8, so 5*404=2020, so 2020+2=2022 is \u22612 mod5, and 2022 \u22642024.\n\nSo the count is 405? Wait, let's compute it.\n\nThe sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022. The number of terms is ((2022 -2)/5) +1 = (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.\n\nSo numbers \u22610 mod5:404.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5:405.\n\nTotal P positions:404+405=809.\n\nWait, but let me check 2024. 2024 mod5 is 2024/5=404*5=2020, remainder 4. So 2024 \u22614 mod5. So the last term in \u22612 mod5 is 2022, which is 404*5 +2=2022. Then 2022 +5=2027>2024, so yes, 405 terms.\n\nSimilarly, for \u22610 mod5: the last term is 2020, which is 404*5. So 404 terms.\n\nSo total P positions:404 +405=809.\n\nSo the answer is 809.\n\nWait, but let me verify with small n.\n\nn=0:0 \u2192 P.\n\nn=1:1 \u2192 N.\n\nn=2:2 \u2192 P.\n\nn=3:3 \u2192 N.\n\nn=4:4 \u2192 N.\n\nn=5:5 \u2192 P.\n\nn=6:6 \u2192 N.\n\nn=7:7 \u2192 P.\n\nn=8:8 \u2192 N.\n\nn=9:9 \u2192 N.\n\nn=10:10 \u2192 P.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the number of n\u22642024 where Bob can win is 809.\n",

So n=10 is P.\n\nHmm, I'm starting to see a pattern here.\n\nLet me list these out:\n\nn : Position (P or N)\n0 : P\n1 : N\n2 : P\n3 : N\n4 : N\n5 : P\n6 : N\n7 : P\n8 : N\n9 : N\n10: P\n11: ?\n\nWait, let's compute n=11.\n\nn=11: Taking 1 leaves n=10 (P), so n=11 is N.\n\nn=12: Taking 1 leaves n=11 (N). Taking 4 leaves n=8 (N). So n=12 is P.\n\nn=13: Taking 1 leaves n=12 (P), so n=13 is N.\n\nn=14: Taking 1 leaves n=13 (N). Taking 4 leaves n=10 (P). So n=14 is N because you can move to P.\n\nn=15: Taking 1 leaves n=14 (N). Taking 4 leaves n=11 (N). So n=15 is P.\n\nHmm, let's see the P positions so far: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,...\n\nWait, let's see the differences between P positions:\n\n2-0=2\n\n5-2=3\n\n7-5=2\n\n10-7=3\n\n12-10=2\n\n15-12=3\n\nSo it alternates between adding 2 and 3.\n\nSo the P positions are every 2, 3, 2, 3, etc. So starting from 0, adding 2 gives 2, then 2+3=5, 5+2=7, 7+3=10, 10+2=12, 12+3=15, 15+2=17, 17+3=20, and so on.\n\nSo the P positions are numbers congruent to 0 mod 5? Wait, let's check.\n\nWait, 0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25, etc.\n\nWait, 0 mod 5 is 0, 2 mod 5 is 2, 5 mod 5 is 0. No, that doesn't seem consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is adding 2 and 3 alternately. So starting from 0:\n\n0, +2=2, +3=5, +2=7, +3=10, +2=12, +3=15, etc.\n\nSo the sequence of P positions is 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27, etc.\n\nSo each P position is either 0 mod 5, 2 mod 5, 5 mod 5 (but 5 is 0 mod5), wait, no.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n0, 2, 5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,...\n\nLooking at mod 5:\n\n0: 0 mod5=0\n\n2: 2 mod5=2\n\n5:0\n\n7:2\n\n10:0\n\n12:2\n\n15:0\n\n17:2\n\n20:0\n\n22:2\n\n25:0\n\n27:2\n\nSo the P positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5? Wait, no, because 5 is 0 mod5, 7 is 2 mod5, 10 is 0 mod5, 12 is 2 mod5, etc.\n\nSo the P positions are the numbers n where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, let's check n=0: 0 mod5=0 \u2192 P.\n\nn=2:2 mod5=2 \u2192 P.\n\nn=5:5 mod5=0 \u2192 P.\n\nn=7:7 mod5=2 \u2192 P.\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0 \u2192 P.\n\nYes, that seems to hold. So if n \u22610 or 2 mod5, then it's a P position, meaning the current player cannot force a win, so the opponent can.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me test n=17:17 mod5=2 \u2192 P.\n\nn=17: Alice can take 1, leaving 16. 16 mod5=1 \u2192 N, so Bob can win from there. Or she can take 4, leaving 13, which is 3 mod5 \u2192 N. So yes, n=17 is P.\n\nSimilarly, n=22:22 mod5=2 \u2192 P. Alice can take 1, leaving 21 (21 mod5=1 \u2192 N). Or take4, leaving 18 (18 mod5=3 \u2192 N). So Bob can win. So 22 is P.\n\nSo the P positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5. So for those n, the current player cannot force a win, so if Alice is faced with such an n on her turn, Bob can win.\n\nWait, but in our problem, Alice goes first. So if n is a P position, Alice is in a losing position, meaning Bob can win. So the number of n \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, let me confirm with n=1:1 mod5=1 \u2192 N. Alice can take 1 and win. So correct, Bob can't win when n=1.\n\nn=2:2 mod5=2 \u2192 P. Alice can't win, so Bob can. Correct.\n\nn=3:3 mod5=3 \u2192 N. Alice can take 1, leaving 2 (P), so Bob loses. So correct.\n\nn=4:4 mod5=4 \u2192 N. Alice can take 4, leaving 0 (P), so Bob can't win. So correct.\n\nn=5:5 mod5=0 \u2192 P. Alice can take 1, leaving 4 (N), or take4, leaving1 (N). So Bob can win. So correct.\n\nSo yes, the P positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo the problem is to count the numbers \u22642024 that are \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo how many numbers \u22642024 are congruent to 0 mod5?\n\nThat's floor(2024/5) = 404 (since 5*404=2020, and 2020 is \u22642024). So 404 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5: The first is 2, then 7, 12,... up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nWhat's the largest number \u22642024 that is \u22612 mod5? Let's see: 2024 divided by5 is 404.8, so 5*404=2020, so 2020+2=2022 is \u22612 mod5, and 2022 \u22642024.\n\nSo the count is 405? Wait, let's compute it.\n\nThe sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022. The number of terms is ((2022 -2)/5) +1 = (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.\n\nSo numbers \u22610 mod5:404.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5:405.\n\nTotal P positions:404+405=809.\n\nWait, but let me check 2024. 2024 mod5 is 2024/5=404*5=2020, remainder 4. So 2024 \u22614 mod5. So the last term in \u22612 mod5 is 2022, which is 404*5 +2=2022. Then 2022 +5=2027>2024, so yes, 405 terms.\n\nSimilarly, for \u22610 mod5: the last term is 2020, which is 404*5. So 404 terms.\n\nSo total P positions:404 +405=809.\n\nSo the answer is 809.\n\nWait, but let me verify with small n.\n\nn=0:0 \u2192 P.\n\nn=1:1 \u2192 N.\n\nn=2:2 \u2192 P.\n\nn=3:3 \u2192 N.\n\nn=4:4 \u2192 N.\n\nn=5:5 \u2192 P.\n\nn=6:6 \u2192 N.\n\nn=7:7 \u2192 P.\n\nn=8:8 \u2192 N.\n\nn=9:9 \u2192 N.\n\nn=10:10 \u2192 P.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the number of n\u22642024 where Bob can win is 809.\n\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game using the concept of P-positions (losing positions) and N-positions (winning positions). \n\n- **P-positions**: If a player is faced with a P-position, they cannot force a win regardless of the opponent's moves.\n- **N-positions**: If a player is faced with an N-position, they can force a win with the right move.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Base Cases**:\n   - \\( n = 0 \\): P-position (game ends).\n   - \\( n = 1 \\): N-position (player takes 1 and wins).\n   - \\( n = 2 \\): P-position (any move leads to N-position).\n   - \\( n = 3 \\): N-position (player takes 1, leaving P-position).\n   - \\( n = 4 \\): N-position (player takes 4 and wins).\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - P-positions occur at \\( n \\equiv 0 \\) or \\( 2 \\mod 5 \\).\n   - This pattern emerges from analyzing small values and recognizing the alternation between adding 2 and 3 to previous P-positions.\n\n3. **Counting P-positions**:\n   - **Numbers \\( \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\)**: There are \\( \\lfloor \\frac{2024}{5} \\rfloor = 404 \\) such numbers.\n   - **Numbers \\( \\equiv 2 \\mod 5 \\)**: The sequence starts at 2 and ends at 2022, yielding \\( \\frac{2022 - 2}{5} + 1 = 405 \\) numbers.\n\n4. **Total P-positions**:\n   - \\( 404 + 405 = 809 \\) numbers \\( \\leq 2024 \\) where Bob can guarantee a win.\n\nThus, the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) for which Bob can guarantee a win is \\(\\boxed{809}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 give Bob a winning strategy, meaning Bob can always win no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, let's try to understand the game mechanics. The players can remove 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. The goal is to take the last token. So, the game is similar to other impartial games where each position can be either a winning or losing position for the player about to move.\n\nI think I should model this as a series of positions (n) where each position is either a winning (N-position) or losing (P-position) position. A P-position is one where the previous player can force a win, assuming both players play optimally. So, if a position is a P-position, the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally. Conversely, an N-position is one where the next player can force a win.\n\nLet me try to figure out the pattern for P-positions. Let's start by listing the positions from 0 upwards and label them as P or N.\n\nn = 0: Well, if there are no tokens, the game is over, so the player who is supposed to move loses. So, n=0 is a P-position because the previous player has won.\n\nn = 1: The current player can take 1 token and win. So, n=1 is an N-position.\n\nn = 2: The current player can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is an N-position. So the opponent is now in a winning position, meaning the current player can force a win. So, n=2 is an N-position.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. If n=2, the current player takes 1, leaving 1 for the opponent. The opponent can then take the last token and win. So, n=2: if I take 1, opponent takes 1 and wins. Alternatively, can I take 4 tokens? No, because n=2 < 4. So, the only move is to take 1, leading to the opponent winning. So n=2 is a P-position? No, wait. Because the current player can't force a win, so n=2 is a P-position. Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier thought.\n\nWait, maybe I need to correct my initial approach. Let me formalize this.\n\nFor each n, if there exists at least one move that leads the opponent into a P-position, then n is an N-position. If all moves lead to N-positions, then n is a P-position.\n\nSo, starting from n=0, which is a P-position.\n\nn=1: From 1, you can take 1 and reach 0 (a P-position). So, n=1 is an N-position.\n\nn=2: From 2, you can take 1, reaching 1 (N-position). Since all moves lead to N-positions, n=2 is a P-position.\n\nn=3: From 3, taking 1 leads to 2 (P-position). So, n=3 is an N-position.\n\nn=4: From 4, you can take 1 (leading to 3, N-position) or 4 (leading to 0, P-position). So, since there's a move to a P-position, n=4 is an N-position.\n\nn=5: From 5, taking 1 leads to 4 (N-position), taking 4 leads to 1 (N-position). So, all moves lead to N-positions. So, n=5 is a P-position.\n\nn=6: From 6, taking 1 leads to 5 (P-position). So, n=6 is an N-position.\n\nn=7: From 7, taking 1 leads to 6 (N-position), taking 4 leads to 3 (N-position). So, all moves lead to N-positions, so n=7 is a P-position.\n\nn=8: From 8, taking 1 leads to 7 (P-position). So, n=8 is an N-position.\n\nn=9: From 9, taking 1 leads to 8 (N-position), taking 4 leads to 5 (P-position). So, n=9 is an N-position because you can move to a P-position.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if from n=9, taking 4 tokens leads to n=5, which is a P-position. So, since there's a move to a P-position, n=9 is an N-position.\n\nWait, but when you take 4 tokens from 9, you get 5. 5 is a P-position. So, n=9 is N.\n\nn=10: From 10, taking 1 leads to 9 (N), taking 4 leads to 6 (N). So, all moves lead to N-positions. So, n=10 is a P-position.\n\nn=11: From 11, taking 1 leads to 10 (P-position). So, n=11 is N.\n\nn=12: From 12, taking 1 leads to 11 (N), taking 4 leads to 8 (N). So, all moves lead to N-positions. So, n=12 is P.\n\nWait, so let me list these:\n\nn | Position\n---|---\n0 | P\n1 | N\n2 | P\n3 | N\n4 | N\n5 | P\n6 | N\n7 | P\n8 | N\n9 | N\n10 | P\n11 | N\n12 | P\n13 | ?\nLet me continue up to n=13.\n\nn=13: Taking 1 leads to 12 (P), so n=13 is N.\n\nn=14: Taking 1 leads to 13 (N), taking 4 leads to 10 (P). So, since one move leads to P, n=14 is N.\n\nn=15: Taking 1 leads to 14 (N), taking 4 leads to 11 (N). So, all moves lead to N, so n=15 is P.\n\nn=16: Taking 1 leads to 15 (P), so n=16 is N.\n\nn=17: Taking 1 leads to 16 (N), taking 4 leads to 13 (N). So, all moves lead to N, so n=17 is P.\n\nn=18: Taking 1 leads to 17 (P), so n=18 is N.\n\nn=19: Taking 1 leads to 18 (N), taking 4 leads to 15 (P). So, since a move leads to P, n=19 is N.\n\nn=20: Taking 1 leads to 19 (N), taking 4 leads to 16 (N). All moves lead to N, so n=20 is P.\n\nHmm, looking for a pattern here.\n\nLet me list the P-positions up to n=20:\n\nP-positions: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20.\n\nLooking at these numbers: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20.\n\nWhat's the pattern? Let me compute the differences:\n\n2-0=2\n\n5-2=3\n\n7-5=2\n\n10-7=3\n\n12-10=2\n\n15-12=3\n\n17-15=2\n\n20-17=3.\n\nSo, the differences alternate between 2 and 3. So, the sequence increases by 2, then 3, then 2, then 3, etc.\n\nSo, starting from 0, the next is +2=2, then +3=5, +2=7, +3=10, +2=12, +3=15, +2=17, +3=20, and so on.\n\nSo, the P-positions are numbers congruent to 0, 2, or 5 modulo something? Let me see.\n\nLooking at the P-positions:\n\n0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20.\n\nLooking modulo 5:\n\n0 mod5=0\n\n2 mod5=2\n\n5 mod5=0\n\n7 mod5=2\n\n10 mod5=0\n\n12 mod5=2\n\n15 mod5=0\n\n17 mod5=2\n\n20 mod5=0\n\nSo, the P-positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5, but starting from 0, 2, 5, etc.\n\nWait, 5 mod5 is 0, but 7 mod5 is 2. So, the pattern seems to be 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... which are numbers that are either 0 mod5, 2 mod5, or 5 mod5? Wait, 5 mod5 is 0, so maybe it's numbers that are 0 or 2 mod5, but starting from 0, then 2, then 5 (which is 0 mod5 again), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the P-positions are numbers where n \u2261 0 or 2 mod5, but let's check.\n\nLooking at n=5: 5 mod5=0. n=7: 7 mod5=2. n=10: 10 mod5=0. n=12:12 mod5=2. n=15:15 mod5=0. n=17:17 mod5=2. n=20:20 mod5=0. So yes, P-positions are n where n \u2261 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, but wait, n=2 is 2 mod5, n=5 is 0 mod5, n=7 is 2 mod5, n=10 is 0 mod5, etc.\n\nSo, the P-positions are n where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the losing positions for the current player are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, when n is 0 or 2 mod5, the current player cannot force a win if the opponent plays optimally.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with n=5.\n\nAt n=5, which is a P-position. So, if it's my turn and n=5, can I force a win? Let's see.\n\nIf I take 1, leaving 4, which is an N-position. The opponent can then take 4 and win. So, if I take 1, opponent can win.\n\nIf I take 4, leaving 1, which is an N-position. Opponent takes 1 and wins. So, no matter what I do, opponent can win. So, yes, n=5 is a P-position.\n\nSimilarly, n=7: If I take 1, opponent gets 6, which is N-position, opponent can win. If I take 4, opponent gets 3, which is N-position, opponent can win. So, n=7 is P.\n\nSo, the pattern seems correct.\n\nThus, the P-positions are n where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, in the problem, Bob can guarantee a win only if the starting position n is a P-position, because Bob is the second player. Wait, no. Wait, in this problem, Alice goes first. So, if n is a P-position, the first player (Alice) is in a losing position if Bob plays optimally. So, Bob can win.\n\nSo, the number of n \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the task reduces to counting the numbers \u22642024 that are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo5.\n\nLet me compute how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5, and how many are \u22612 mod5.\n\nTotal numbers = count_0 + count_2.\n\nCompute count_0: The numbers are 5,10,15,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nThe maximum multiple of 5 \u22642024 is 2020 (since 2024 /5=404.8, so 404*5=2020).\n\nSo, the number of terms is 2020 /5=404. So, count_0=404.\n\nSimilarly, count_2: The numbers are 2,7,12,17,... up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nWhat's the maximum number \u22612 mod5 \u22642024?\n\n2024 divided by 5 is 404.8. So, 5*404=2020. 2020 +2=2022, which is \u22642024.\n\nSo, the sequence starts at 2, and each term is 5 apart.\n\nSo, the number of terms can be found by:\n\nThe nth term is 2 +5*(k-1) =5k -3.\n\nWe need 5k -3 \u22642024 \u21925k \u22642027 \u2192k \u22642027/5=405.4. So, k=405.\n\nSo, the number of terms is 405.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nFirst term k=1: 2+5*(1-1)=2.\n\nLast term k=405: 2+5*(405-1)=2+5*404=2+2020=2022.\n\nYes, 2022 is \u22642024.\n\nSo, count_2=405.\n\nSo, total P-positions are 404+405=809.\n\nWait, but wait, n=0 is a P-position, but the problem states positive integers, so n\u22651. So, n=0 isn't counted. So, in our earlier count, count_0=404, but n=0 is excluded. So, for count_0, the numbers are 5,10,...,2020, which is 404 numbers. So, no problem.\n\nSimilarly, count_2 includes n=2,7,12,...2022, which is 405 numbers.\n\nSo, total is 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but wait, let me confirm:\n\nNumbers congruent to 0 mod5: from 5 to 2020, inclusive. The count is (2020 -5)/5 +1= (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.\n\nNumbers congruent to 2 mod5: from 2 to 2022, inclusive. The count is (2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo, total numbers where n is a P-position is 404+405=809.\n\nTherefore, the number of n \u22642024 where Bob can guarantee a win is 809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the initial P-positions I calculated up to n=20.\n\nEarlier, I saw that P-positions are n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nWhich matches with n\u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the conclusion is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 809.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that I didn't miscount. Let me compute the numbers again.\n\nNumbers congruent to 0 mod5 up to 2024: 5,10,...,2020.\n\nNumber of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1= (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.\n\nNumbers congruent to 2 mod5 up to 2024: 2,7,...,2022.\n\nNumber of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nTotal:404+405=809.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of positive integers n \u22642024 where Bob can force a win is 809.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 give Bob a winning strategy, meaning Bob can always win no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, let's try to understand the game mechanics. The players can remove 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. The goal is to take the last token. So, the game is similar to other impartial games where each position can be either a winning or losing position for the player about to move.\n\nI think I should model this as a series of positions (n) where each position is either a winning (N-position) or losing (P-position) position. A P-position is one where the previous player can force a win, assuming both players play optimally. So, if a position is a P-position, the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally. Conversely, an N-position is one where the next player can force a win.\n\nLet me try to figure out the pattern for P-positions. Let's start by listing the positions from 0 upwards and label them as P or N.\n\nn = 0: Well, if there are no tokens, the game is over, so the player who is supposed to move loses. So, n=0 is a P-position because the previous player has won.\n\nn = 1: The current player can take 1 token and win. So, n=1 is an N-position.\n\nn = 2: The current player can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is an N-position. So the opponent is now in a winning position, meaning the current player can force a win. So, n=2 is an N-position.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. If n=2, the current player takes 1, leaving 1 for the opponent. The opponent can then take the last token and win. So, n=2: if I take 1, opponent takes 1 and wins. Alternatively, can I take 4 tokens? No, because n=2 < 4. So, the only move is to take 1, leading to the opponent winning. So n=2 is a P-position? No, wait. Because the current player can't force a win, so n=2 is a P-position. Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier thought.\n\nWait, maybe I need to correct my initial approach. Let me formalize this.\n\nFor each n, if there exists at least one move that leads the opponent into a P-position, then n is an N-position. If all moves lead to N-positions, then n is a P-position.\n\nSo, starting from n=0, which is a P-position.\n\nn=1: From 1, you can take 1 and reach 0 (a P-position). So, n=1 is an N-position.\n\nn=2: From 2, you can take 1, reaching 1 (N-position). Since all moves lead to N-positions, n=2 is a P-position.\n\nn=3: From 3, taking 1 leads to 2 (P-position). So, n=3 is an N-position.\n\nn=4: From 4, you can take 1 (leading to 3, N-position) or 4 (leading to 0, P-position). So, since there's a move to a P-position, n=4 is an N-position.\n\nn=5: From 5, taking 1 leads to 4 (N-position), taking 4 leads to 1 (N-position). So, all moves lead to N-positions. So, n=5 is a P-position.\n\nn=6: From 6, taking 1 leads to 5 (P-position). So, n=6 is an N-position.\n\nn=7: From 7, taking 1 leads to 6 (N-position), taking 4 leads to 3 (N-position). So, all moves lead to N-positions, so n=7 is a P-position.\n\nn=8: From 8, taking 1 leads to 7 (P-position). So, n=8 is an N-position.\n\nn=9: From 9, taking 1 leads to 8 (N-position), taking 4 leads to 5 (P-position). So, n=9 is an N-position because you can move to a P-position.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if from n=9, taking 4 tokens leads to n=5, which is a P-position. So, since there's a move to a P-position, n=9 is an N-position.\n\nWait, but when you take 4 tokens from 9, you get 5. 5 is a P-position. So, n=9 is N.\n\nn=10: From 10, taking 1 leads to 9 (N), taking 4 leads to 6 (N). So, all moves lead to N-positions. So, n=10 is a P-position.\n\nn=11: From 11, taking 1 leads to 10 (P-position). So, n=11 is N.\n\nn=12: From 12, taking 1 leads to 11 (N), taking 4 leads to 8 (N). So, all moves lead to N-positions. So, n=12 is P.\n\nWait, so let me list these:\n\nn | Position\n---|---\n0 | P\n1 | N\n2 | P\n3 | N\n4 | N\n5 | P\n6 | N\n7 | P\n8 | N\n9 | N\n10 | P\n11 | N\n12 | P\n13 | ?\nLet me continue up to n=13.\n\nn=13: Taking 1 leads to 12 (P), so n=13 is N.\n\nn=14: Taking 1 leads to 13 (N), taking 4 leads to 10 (P). So, since one move leads to P, n=14 is N.\n\nn=15: Taking 1 leads to 14 (N), taking 4 leads to 11 (N). So, all moves lead to N, so n=15 is P.\n\nn=16: Taking 1 leads to 15 (P), so n=16 is N.\n\nn=17: Taking 1 leads to 16 (N), taking 4 leads to 13 (N). So, all moves lead to N, so n=17 is P.\n\nn=18: Taking 1 leads to 17 (P), so n=18 is N.\n\nn=19: Taking 1 leads to 18 (N), taking 4 leads to 15 (P). So, since a move leads to P, n=19 is N.\n\nn=20: Taking 1 leads to 19 (N), taking 4 leads to 16 (N). All moves lead to N, so n=20 is P.\n\nHmm, looking for a pattern here.\n\nLet me list the P-positions up to n=20:\n\nP-positions: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20.\n\nLooking at these numbers: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20.\n\nWhat's the pattern? Let me compute the differences:\n\n2-0=2\n\n5-2=3\n\n7-5=2\n\n10-7=3\n\n12-10=2\n\n15-12=3\n\n17-15=2\n\n20-17=3.\n\nSo, the differences alternate between 2 and 3. So, the sequence increases by 2, then 3, then 2, then 3, etc.\n\nSo, starting from 0, the next is +2=2, then +3=5, +2=7, +3=10, +2=12, +3=15, +2=17, +3=20, and so on.\n\nSo, the P-positions are numbers congruent to 0, 2, or 5 modulo something? Let me see.\n\nLooking at the P-positions:\n\n0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20.\n\nLooking modulo 5:\n\n0 mod5=0\n\n2 mod5=2\n\n5 mod5=0\n\n7 mod5=2\n\n10 mod5=0\n\n12 mod5=2\n\n15 mod5=0\n\n17 mod5=2\n\n20 mod5=0\n\nSo, the P-positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5, but starting from 0, 2, 5, etc.\n\nWait, 5 mod5 is 0, but 7 mod5 is 2. So, the pattern seems to be 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... which are numbers that are either 0 mod5, 2 mod5, or 5 mod5? Wait, 5 mod5 is 0, so maybe it's numbers that are 0 or 2 mod5, but starting from 0, then 2, then 5 (which is 0 mod5 again), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the P-positions are numbers where n \u2261 0 or 2 mod5, but let's check.\n\nLooking at n=5: 5 mod5=0. n=7: 7 mod5=2. n=10: 10 mod5=0. n=12:12 mod5=2. n=15:15 mod5=0. n=17:17 mod5=2. n=20:20 mod5=0. So yes, P-positions are n where n \u2261 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, but wait, n=2 is 2 mod5, n=5 is 0 mod5, n=7 is 2 mod5, n=10 is 0 mod5, etc.\n\nSo, the P-positions are n where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the losing positions for the current player are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, when n is 0 or 2 mod5, the current player cannot force a win if the opponent plays optimally.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with n=5.\n\nAt n=5, which is a P-position. So, if it's my turn and n=5, can I force a win? Let's see.\n\nIf I take 1, leaving 4, which is an N-position. The opponent can then take 4 and win. So, if I take 1, opponent can win.\n\nIf I take 4, leaving 1, which is an N-position. Opponent takes 1 and wins. So, no matter what I do, opponent can win. So, yes, n=5 is a P-position.\n\nSimilarly, n=7: If I take 1, opponent gets 6, which is N-position, opponent can win. If I take 4, opponent gets 3, which is N-position, opponent can win. So, n=7 is P.\n\nSo, the pattern seems correct.\n\nThus, the P-positions are n where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, in the problem, Bob can guarantee a win only if the starting position n is a P-position, because Bob is the second player. Wait, no. Wait, in this problem, Alice goes first. So, if n is a P-position, the first player (Alice) is in a losing position if Bob plays optimally. So, Bob can win.\n\nSo, the number of n \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the task reduces to counting the numbers \u22642024 that are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo5.\n\nLet me compute how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5, and how many are \u22612 mod5.\n\nTotal numbers = count_0 + count_2.\n\nCompute count_0: The numbers are 5,10,15,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nThe maximum multiple of 5 \u22642024 is 2020 (since 2024 /5=404.8, so 404*5=2020).\n\nSo, the number of terms is 2020 /5=404. So, count_0=404.\n\nSimilarly, count_2: The numbers are 2,7,12,17,... up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nWhat's the maximum number \u22612 mod5 \u22642024?\n\n2024 divided by 5 is 404.8. So, 5*404=2020. 2020 +2=2022, which is \u22642024.\n\nSo, the sequence starts at 2, and each term is 5 apart.\n\nSo, the number of terms can be found by:\n\nThe nth term is 2 +5*(k-1) =5k -3.\n\nWe need 5k -3 \u22642024 \u21925k \u22642027 \u2192k \u22642027/5=405.4. So, k=405.\n\nSo, the number of terms is 405.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nFirst term k=1: 2+5*(1-1)=2.\n\nLast term k=405: 2+5*(405-1)=2+5*404=2+2020=2022.\n\nYes, 2022 is \u22642024.\n\nSo, count_2=405.\n\nSo, total P-positions are 404+405=809.\n\nWait, but wait, n=0 is a P-position, but the problem states positive integers, so n\u22651. So, n=0 isn't counted. So, in our earlier count, count_0=404, but n=0 is excluded. So, for count_0, the numbers are 5,10,...,2020, which is 404 numbers. So, no problem.\n\nSimilarly, count_2 includes n=2,7,12,...2022, which is 405 numbers.\n\nSo, total is 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but wait, let me confirm:\n\nNumbers congruent to 0 mod5: from 5 to 2020, inclusive. The count is (2020 -5)/5 +1= (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.\n\nNumbers congruent to 2 mod5: from 2 to 2022, inclusive. The count is (2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo, total numbers where n is a P-position is 404+405=809.\n\nTherefore, the number of n \u22642024 where Bob can guarantee a win is 809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the initial P-positions I calculated up to n=20.\n\nEarlier, I saw that P-positions are n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nWhich matches with n\u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the conclusion is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 809.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that I didn't miscount. Let me compute the numbers again.\n\nNumbers congruent to 0 mod5 up to 2024: 5,10,...,2020.\n\nNumber of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1= (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.\n\nNumbers congruent to 2 mod5 up to 2024: 2,7,...,2022.\n\nNumber of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nTotal:404+405=809.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of positive integers n \u22642024 where Bob can force a win is 809.\n\n\nThe problem involves Alice and Bob playing a game with a stack of \\( n \\) tokens, where each player can remove 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. Alice goes first, and the player who takes the last token wins. We need to determine how many positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) allow Bob to guarantee a win, regardless of Alice's moves.\n\nTo solve this, we analyze the game using the concept of winning (N-position) and losing (P-position) positions. A P-position is one where the current player cannot force a win if the opponent plays optimally. By examining the game from \\( n = 0 \\) upwards, we identify the P-positions as those where \\( n \\equiv 0 \\) or \\( 2 \\pmod{5} \\).\n\nFor \\( n \\leq 2024 \\):\n- Numbers congruent to 0 modulo 5: These are 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020. There are \\( \\frac{2020}{5} = 404 \\) such numbers.\n- Numbers congruent to 2 modulo 5: These are 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022. There are \\( \\frac{2022 - 2}{5} + 1 = 405 \\) such numbers.\n\nAdding these, the total number of P-positions is \\( 404 + 405 = 809 \\). Therefore, there are 809 values of \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) where Bob can guarantee a win.\n\n\\boxed{809}",

The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, I think this is a classic combinatorial game theory problem. It's about determining the winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.\n\nSo, let me start by analyzing small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLet's list n from 0 upwards and label each as winning (W) or losing (L) positions. Remember that the player who takes the last token wins.\n\nn=0: Well, if there are no tokens, the game is already over. So the player who is supposed to move loses. So n=0 is a losing position. But wait, in our problem, n starts at 1, so maybe I can consider n=0 as a losing position for the player about to move.\n\nn=1: Alice can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice.\n\nn=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take that 1 and win. Wait, no, wait: if Alice takes 1 from 2, then Bob is left with 1 token. Bob can take that 1 and win. But Alice's goal is to make Bob face a losing position. So if Alice can take 1 token from n=2, leaving n=1, which is a winning position for Bob. Alternatively, can Alice take 4 tokens? No, because n=2 <4, so she can't. So her only move is to take 1, leaving 1, which is a win for Bob. So Bob can win from n=2? Wait, wait, no, because Bob can take the last token. So for n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1, then Bob takes 1 and wins. So n=2 is a winning position for Alice? Because she can make Bob win? No, wait, that's not right. If n=2, Alice can only take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So Alice is forced to let Bob win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob.\n\nWait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. If n=2, Alice's options are to take 1, leaving 1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So for Alice, n=2 is a losing position because whatever she does, Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for the current player (Alice). So Bob can win if n=2.\n\nWait, no, wait. The definition is: a position is losing if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. So for n=2, the current player (Alice) can take 1, leading to n=1, which is a winning position for Bob. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win if it's his turn, but Alice is the one moving first. Wait, no, if Alice is at n=2, she can only take 1, leading Bob to n=1, which is a winning position for Bob. So if Alice is faced with n=2, she can't force a win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob.\n\nWait, but wait: when n=2, Alice's only move is to take 1, leading to n=1, which is a winning position for Bob. So Bob can win from n=1, so n=2 is a losing position for Alice. So the current player (Alice) can't force a win, so n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win if n=2.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this step by step.\n\nLet me create a table:\n\nn | Winning (W) or Losing (L)\n0 | L (since no move can be made; current player loses)\n1 | W (take 1, win)\n2 | ?\n3 | ?\n4 | ?\n5 | ?\n... and so on.\n\nLet's go step by step.\n\nn=0: L (current player can't move, so loses)\nn=1: current player can take 1 and win \u2192 W\nn=2: current player can take 1, leading to n=1 (W for opponent). So if current player takes 1, opponent can win. So for n=2, all moves lead to opponent's W. So n=2 is L.\n\nWait, that can't be right because n=2: if Alice takes 1, Bob gets n=1 and can win. So Alice would lose if n=2. So n=2 is L for Alice.\n\nWait, but wait: when n=2, the current player can take 1 token, leading to n=1, which is a W position for the next player. So the current player (Alice) cannot force a win because the next player can win. So n=2 is L.\n\nn=3: current player can take 1, leading to n=2 (L). So if the current player takes 1, the next player is in a losing position. So n=3 is W.\n\nWait, because from n=3, taking 1 leaves n=2 (L for the next player). So the current player can win by taking 1. So n=3 is W.\n\nn=4: current player can take 1, leading to n=3 (W) for opponent, or take 4, leading to n=0 (L). Wait, taking 4 from n=4 would leave 0, which is a losing position for the opponent. So current player can take 4 and win immediately. So n=4 is W.\n\nWait, but wait: if n=4, current player can take 4 and win. So n=4 is W.\n\nn=5: current player can take 1, leading to n=4 (W), or take 4, leading to n=1 (W). So all moves from n=5 lead to W positions for the opponent. So n=5 is L.\n\nWait, because from n=5, any move (take 1 or 4) leaves the opponent in a W position. So n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: current player can take 1, leading to n=5 (L), or take 4, leading to n=2 (L). Wait, both options lead to L positions for the opponent. So n=6 is W? Because the current player can choose a move that leaves the opponent in L.\n\nWait, no, wait. If from n=6, taking 1 leads to n=5 (L), which is a losing position for the opponent, so the current player can force a win by taking 1. So n=6 is W.\n\nWait, but wait, I thought earlier that n=2 is L. So if from n=6, taking 1 leads to n=5 (L), then current player can win, so n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: current player can take 1, leading to n=6 (W), or take 4, leading to n=3 (W). So both moves leave the opponent in W positions. So n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: current player can take 1, leading to n=7 (L), or take 4, leading to n=4 (W). So taking 1 leads to L for opponent, so current player can win by taking 1. So n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: current player can take 1, leading to n=8 (W), or take 4, leading to n=5 (L). So taking 4 leaves opponent in L. So n=9 is W.\n\nWait, because taking 4 from n=9 leaves n=5, which is L. So current player can win.\n\nn=10: current player can take 1, leading to n=9 (W), or take 4, leading to n=6 (W). Both options leave opponent in W positions. So n=10 is L.\n\nHmm, let me see the pattern so far.\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nW/L: L W L W W L W L W W L\n\nWait, that seems to be a pattern every 5 numbers? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the W/L sequence:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nW/L: L W L W W L W L W W L\n\nSo positions 0,2,5,7,10 are L. The next would be n=12? Let me check n=11.\n\nn=11: current player can take 1 to n=10 (L) or take 4 to n=7 (L). So both options leave opponent in L. So n=11 is W.\n\nWait, because from n=11, taking 1 leads to n=10 (L), so current player can win. So n=11 is W.\n\nn=12: current player can take 1 to n=11 (W) or take 4 to n=8 (W). Both options leave opponent in W. So n=12 is L.\n\nSo the L positions are n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17, etc. It seems like the losing positions are every 5 starting from 0, but with some offset.\n\nWait, let's list the losing positions (L) as I found so far:\n\nn=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,...\n\nLooking at the differences between consecutive L positions:\n\n2-0=2\n\n5-2=3\n\n7-5=2\n\n10-7=3\n\n12-10=2\n\n15-12=3\n\n17-15=2\n\n20-17=3\n\n22-20=2\n\nSo the pattern alternates between adding 2 and adding 3. So the losing positions are 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,...\n\nSo the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod 5? Let's see:\n\nn=0: 0 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=5:5 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=7:7 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nYes, that seems to fit. So the losing positions are n \u2261 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, but wait: n=5 is 0 mod5, and it's L. n=7 is 2 mod5, L. n=10 is 0 mod5, L. n=12 is 2 mod5, L. So yes, the losing positions are numbers where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nSo, for any n \u22610 or 2 mod5, the position is losing for the current player. So Bob can win if n is a losing position for Alice, because Alice is the first player. So if n is a losing position, Alice can't force a win, so Bob can.\n\nSo the question is, how many n \u22642024 are \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo we need to count the numbers \u22642024 where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nLet me calculate how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5.\n\nThe largest multiple of 5 \u22642024 is floor(2024/5)*5. Let's compute 2024 \u00f75:\n\n5*404=2020, so 2020 is the largest multiple of 5 \u22642024.\n\nSo the numbers are 0,5,10,...,2020. The count is 2020/5 +1=404 +1=405. Wait, no: from 0 to 2020, step 5: the number of terms is (2020 -0)/5 +1 = 404 +1=405.\n\nWait, but n starts from 1, so n=0 is not included. So the numbers are 5,10,...,2020. So count is (2020-5)/5 +1= (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.\n\nSimilarly for numbers \u22612 mod5: numbers are 2,7,12,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nWhat's the largest number \u22642024 that is \u22612 mod5?\n\n2024 \u00f75 is 404.8, so 5*404=2020, so 2020+2=2022 is \u22642024.\n\nSo the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nNumber of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1 = (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nWait, because (2022 -2) =2020, divided by 5 is 404, plus 1 is 405 terms.\n\nSo total numbers where n \u22610 or 2 mod5 is 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5)=809.\n\nWait, but wait: let me check if 2024 is included. The maximum n is 2024. So for 0 mod5, the last term is 2020. For 2 mod5, the last term is 2022, which is \u22642024. So 2022 is included, but 2024 is \u22614 mod5, so it's not included.\n\nSo the total count is 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5) = 809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts.\n\nFor 0 mod5: numbers are 5,10,15,...,2020.\n\nNumber of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.\n\nYes.\n\nFor 2 mod5: numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nNumber of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo total is 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but wait: n=0 is not included, but n=2 is included because n starts at 1. So in the 2 mod5 case, n=2 is included, so the count is correct as 405.\n\nSo the answer should be 809.\n\nBut let me think again: in the initial analysis, n=0 is a losing position, but since n starts at 1, the first losing position is n=2. So in the range 1 to 2024, how many numbers \u22610 or 2 mod5?\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5: 5,10,...,2020 \u2192 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5:2,7,12,...,2022 \u2192 405 numbers.\n\nTotal:404+405=809.\n\nSo the answer is 809.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the losing positions are indeed n\u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nEarlier, when I listed up to n=12, the losing positions were 0,2,5,7,10,12, etc., which fit 0 and 2 mod5.\n\nSo yes, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nThus, the number of n \u22642024 where Bob can win is 809.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) where Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game using combinatorial game theory.

      "full_content": "Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, I think this is a classic combinatorial game theory problem. It's about determining the winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.\n\nSo, let me start by analyzing small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLet's list n from 0 upwards and label each as winning (W) or losing (L) positions. Remember that the player who takes the last token wins.\n\nn=0: Well, if there are no tokens, the game is already over. So the player who is supposed to move loses. So n=0 is a losing position. But wait, in our problem, n starts at 1, so maybe I can consider n=0 as a losing position for the player about to move.\n\nn=1: Alice can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice.\n\nn=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take that 1 and win. Wait, no, wait: if Alice takes 1 from 2, then Bob is left with 1 token. Bob can take that 1 and win. But Alice's goal is to make Bob face a losing position. So if Alice can take 1 token from n=2, leaving n=1, which is a winning position for Bob. Alternatively, can Alice take 4 tokens? No, because n=2 <4, so she can't. So her only move is to take 1, leaving 1, which is a win for Bob. So Bob can win from n=2? Wait, wait, no, because Bob can take the last token. So for n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1, then Bob takes 1 and wins. So n=2 is a winning position for Alice? Because she can make Bob win? No, wait, that's not right. If n=2, Alice can only take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So Alice is forced to let Bob win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob.\n\nWait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. If n=2, Alice's options are to take 1, leaving 1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So for Alice, n=2 is a losing position because whatever she does, Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for the current player (Alice). So Bob can win if n=2.\n\nWait, no, wait. The definition is: a position is losing if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. So for n=2, the current player (Alice) can take 1, leading to n=1, which is a winning position for Bob. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win if it's his turn, but Alice is the one moving first. Wait, no, if Alice is at n=2, she can only take 1, leading Bob to n=1, which is a winning position for Bob. So if Alice is faced with n=2, she can't force a win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob.\n\nWait, but wait: when n=2, Alice's only move is to take 1, leading to n=1, which is a winning position for Bob. So Bob can win from n=1, so n=2 is a losing position for Alice. So the current player (Alice) can't force a win, so n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win if n=2.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this step by step.\n\nLet me create a table:\n\nn | Winning (W) or Losing (L)\n0 | L (since no move can be made; current player loses)\n1 | W (take 1, win)\n2 | ?\n3 | ?\n4 | ?\n5 | ?\n... and so on.\n\nLet's go step by step.\n\nn=0: L (current player can't move, so loses)\nn=1: current player can take 1 and win \u2192 W\nn=2: current player can take 1, leading to n=1 (W for opponent). So if current player takes 1, opponent can win. So for n=2, all moves lead to opponent's W. So n=2 is L.\n\nWait, that can't be right because n=2: if Alice takes 1, Bob gets n=1 and can win. So Alice would lose if n=2. So n=2 is L for Alice.\n\nWait, but wait: when n=2, the current player can take 1 token, leading to n=1, which is a W position for the next player. So the current player (Alice) cannot force a win because the next player can win. So n=2 is L.\n\nn=3: current player can take 1, leading to n=2 (L). So if the current player takes 1, the next player is in a losing position. So n=3 is W.\n\nWait, because from n=3, taking 1 leaves n=2 (L for the next player). So the current player can win by taking 1. So n=3 is W.\n\nn=4: current player can take 1, leading to n=3 (W) for opponent, or take 4, leading to n=0 (L). Wait, taking 4 from n=4 would leave 0, which is a losing position for the opponent. So current player can take 4 and win immediately. So n=4 is W.\n\nWait, but wait: if n=4, current player can take 4 and win. So n=4 is W.\n\nn=5: current player can take 1, leading to n=4 (W), or take 4, leading to n=1 (W). So all moves from n=5 lead to W positions for the opponent. So n=5 is L.\n\nWait, because from n=5, any move (take 1 or 4) leaves the opponent in a W position. So n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: current player can take 1, leading to n=5 (L), or take 4, leading to n=2 (L). Wait, both options lead to L positions for the opponent. So n=6 is W? Because the current player can choose a move that leaves the opponent in L.\n\nWait, no, wait. If from n=6, taking 1 leads to n=5 (L), which is a losing position for the opponent, so the current player can force a win by taking 1. So n=6 is W.\n\nWait, but wait, I thought earlier that n=2 is L. So if from n=6, taking 1 leads to n=5 (L), then current player can win, so n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: current player can take 1, leading to n=6 (W), or take 4, leading to n=3 (W). So both moves leave the opponent in W positions. So n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: current player can take 1, leading to n=7 (L), or take 4, leading to n=4 (W). So taking 1 leads to L for opponent, so current player can win by taking 1. So n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: current player can take 1, leading to n=8 (W), or take 4, leading to n=5 (L). So taking 4 leaves opponent in L. So n=9 is W.\n\nWait, because taking 4 from n=9 leaves n=5, which is L. So current player can win.\n\nn=10: current player can take 1, leading to n=9 (W), or take 4, leading to n=6 (W). Both options leave opponent in W positions. So n=10 is L.\n\nHmm, let me see the pattern so far.\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nW/L: L W L W W L W L W W L\n\nWait, that seems to be a pattern every 5 numbers? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the W/L sequence:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nW/L: L W L W W L W L W W L\n\nSo positions 0,2,5,7,10 are L. The next would be n=12? Let me check n=11.\n\nn=11: current player can take 1 to n=10 (L) or take 4 to n=7 (L). So both options leave opponent in L. So n=11 is W.\n\nWait, because from n=11, taking 1 leads to n=10 (L), so current player can win. So n=11 is W.\n\nn=12: current player can take 1 to n=11 (W) or take 4 to n=8 (W). Both options leave opponent in W. So n=12 is L.\n\nSo the L positions are n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17, etc. It seems like the losing positions are every 5 starting from 0, but with some offset.\n\nWait, let's list the losing positions (L) as I found so far:\n\nn=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,...\n\nLooking at the differences between consecutive L positions:\n\n2-0=2\n\n5-2=3\n\n7-5=2\n\n10-7=3\n\n12-10=2\n\n15-12=3\n\n17-15=2\n\n20-17=3\n\n22-20=2\n\nSo the pattern alternates between adding 2 and adding 3. So the losing positions are 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,...\n\nSo the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod 5? Let's see:\n\nn=0: 0 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=5:5 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=7:7 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nYes, that seems to fit. So the losing positions are n \u2261 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, but wait: n=5 is 0 mod5, and it's L. n=7 is 2 mod5, L. n=10 is 0 mod5, L. n=12 is 2 mod5, L. So yes, the losing positions are numbers where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nSo, for any n \u22610 or 2 mod5, the position is losing for the current player. So Bob can win if n is a losing position for Alice, because Alice is the first player. So if n is a losing position, Alice can't force a win, so Bob can.\n\nSo the question is, how many n \u22642024 are \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo we need to count the numbers \u22642024 where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nLet me calculate how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5.\n\nThe largest multiple of 5 \u22642024 is floor(2024/5)*5. Let's compute 2024 \u00f75:\n\n5*404=2020, so 2020 is the largest multiple of 5 \u22642024.\n\nSo the numbers are 0,5,10,...,2020. The count is 2020/5 +1=404 +1=405. Wait, no: from 0 to 2020, step 5: the number of terms is (2020 -0)/5 +1 = 404 +1=405.\n\nWait, but n starts from 1, so n=0 is not included. So the numbers are 5,10,...,2020. So count is (2020-5)/5 +1= (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.\n\nSimilarly for numbers \u22612 mod5: numbers are 2,7,12,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nWhat's the largest number \u22642024 that is \u22612 mod5?\n\n2024 \u00f75 is 404.8, so 5*404=2020, so 2020+2=2022 is \u22642024.\n\nSo the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nNumber of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1 = (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nWait, because (2022 -2) =2020, divided by 5 is 404, plus 1 is 405 terms.\n\nSo total numbers where n \u22610 or 2 mod5 is 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5)=809.\n\nWait, but wait: let me check if 2024 is included. The maximum n is 2024. So for 0 mod5, the last term is 2020. For 2 mod5, the last term is 2022, which is \u22642024. So 2022 is included, but 2024 is \u22614 mod5, so it's not included.\n\nSo the total count is 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5) = 809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts.\n\nFor 0 mod5: numbers are 5,10,15,...,2020.\n\nNumber of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.\n\nYes.\n\nFor 2 mod5: numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nNumber of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo total is 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but wait: n=0 is not included, but n=2 is included because n starts at 1. So in the 2 mod5 case, n=2 is included, so the count is correct as 405.\n\nSo the answer should be 809.\n\nBut let me think again: in the initial analysis, n=0 is a losing position, but since n starts at 1, the first losing position is n=2. So in the range 1 to 2024, how many numbers \u22610 or 2 mod5?\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5: 5,10,...,2020 \u2192 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5:2,7,12,...,2022 \u2192 405 numbers.\n\nTotal:404+405=809.\n\nSo the answer is 809.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the losing positions are indeed n\u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nEarlier, when I listed up to n=12, the losing positions were 0,2,5,7,10,12, etc., which fit 0 and 2 mod5.\n\nSo yes, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nThus, the number of n \u22642024 where Bob can win is 809.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) where Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game using combinatorial game theory. The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns removing 1 or 4 tokens from a stack, with Alice going first. The player who removes the last token wins.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Base Cases**:\n   - \\( n = 0 \\): The game is over; the current player loses.\n   - \\( n = 1 \\): Alice takes 1 token and wins.\n   - \\( n = 2 \\): Alice can only take 1 token, leaving \\( n = 1 \\) for Bob, who then wins.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. We need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 give Bob a winning strategy, meaning no matter what Alice does, Bob can win.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as winning or losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, let's model this. Let's define a position as losing if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. Conversely, a position is winning if the current player can force a win.\n\nThe base case is when there are 0 tokens left. If it's your turn and there are 0 tokens, you lose because you can't make a move. So, position 0 is a losing position.\n\nNow, let's consider small values of n and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nn = 1: Alice can take 1 token and win. So, position 1 is a winning position.\n\nn = 2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob can then take that 1 and win. Wait, but that would mean Alice loses. Wait, no, if Alice takes 1, Bob takes the last one and wins. So, if n=2, Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1 and wins. So, Alice would lose. But wait, can Alice make a different move? No, because from n=2, she can only take 1 or 4, but 4 is more than 2, so only 1. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2 is Alice's turn, and she can't force a win, then n=2 is a losing position for the current player (Alice). So, from Alice's perspective, n=2 is a losing position because whatever she does, Bob can win.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Maybe I should think in terms of Grundy numbers or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to list the positions as winning (W) or losing (L) starting from n=0.\n\nLet me try that:\n\nn | outcome (current player can win)\n0 | L (no moves)\n1 | W (take 1)\n2 | ?\n3 | ?\n4 | W (take 4)\n5 | ?\n... etc.\n\nWait, let's go step by step.\n\nn=0: L (current player loses)\n\nn=1: current player can take 1 and win. So W.\n\nn=2: current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent. Since n=1 is a W position for the opponent, the opponent can win. So, the current player at n=2 must take 1, leading to opponent's W. Therefore, n=2 is L? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2 is current player's turn, they can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. Alternatively, can the current player take 4? No, because 4 > 2. So, only move is to take 1. So, the opponent can win, which means the current player at n=2 cannot force a win. So, n=2 is L.\n\nn=3: current player can take 1, leaving n=2 (which is L for opponent). So, if current player takes 1, opponent is at L, meaning current player can win. So, n=3 is W.\n\nn=4: current player can take 4 and win. So, W.\n\nn=5: current player can take 1, leaving n=4 (W for opponent). Or take 4, leaving n=1 (W for opponent). So, whatever current player does, opponent can win. So, n=5 is L.\n\nWait, let me double-check. At n=5, if current player takes 1, opponent is at n=4, which is W for opponent (they can take 4 and win). If current player takes 4, opponent is at n=1, which is W (opponent takes 1 and wins). So, yes, n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: current player can take 1, leaving n=5 (L for opponent). So, current player can force opponent into L. So, n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: current player can take 1, leaving n=6 (W for opponent). Or take 4, leaving n=3 (W for opponent). So, both options lead to opponent's W. Therefore, n=7 is L.\n\nWait, no. Let's check again. At n=7, taking 1 leaves n=6 (W for opponent). Taking 4 leaves n=3 (W for opponent). So, opponent can win in either case. So, n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: current player can take 1, leaving n=7 (L for opponent). So, current player can force opponent into L. So, n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: current player can take 1, leaving n=8 (W). Or take 4, leaving n=5 (L). So, if current player takes 4, opponent is at L. So, n=9 is W.\n\nWait, because taking 4 from 9 leaves 5, which is L, so opponent can't win. So, current player can win by taking 4. Therefore, n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: current player can take 1, leaving n=9 (W). Or take 4, leaving n=6 (W). So, both options lead to opponent's W. So, n=10 is L.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let's see: n=10. If current player takes 1, opponent is at n=9 (W). Opponent can then take 4, leaving 5 (L) for current player. So, current player is forced into L. Alternatively, if current player takes 4 from 10, leaving 6 (W). Opponent can take 1, leaving 5 (L). So, either way, opponent can force current player into L. So, n=10 is L.\n\nn=11: current player can take 1, leaving n=10 (L). So, opponent is at L, meaning current player can win. So, n=11 is W.\n\nn=12: current player can take 1, leaving n=11 (W). Or take 4, leaving n=8 (W). So, both options leave opponent at W. So, n=12 is L.\n\nWait, no. Wait, n=12. Let me think again. If current player takes 1, opponent is at n=11 (W). Opponent can take 1, leaving 10 (L) for current player. Alternatively, if current player takes 4, opponent is at n=8 (W). Opponent can take 4, leaving 4 (W). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should list the outcomes step by step.\n\nLet me try to make a table for n from 0 to, say, 12.\n\nn | outcome (current player can win)\n0 | L\n1 | W\n2 | L\n3 | W\n4 | W\n5 | L\n6 | W\n7 | L\n8 | W\n9 | W\n10| L\n11| W\n12| ?\n\nWait, let me fill it step by step.\n\nn=0: L\n\nn=1: Can take 1, so W.\n\nn=2: Only can take 1, leaving n=1 (W for opponent). So, opponent can win, so n=2 is L.\n\nn=3: Take 1, leaving n=2 (L for opponent). So, W.\n\nn=4: Take 4, so W.\n\nn=5: Take 1 \u2192 n=4 (W). Take 4 \u2192 n=1 (W). Both options leave opponent in W. So, n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: Take 1 \u2192 n=5 (L). So, opponent is in L. So, n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: Take 1 \u2192 n=6 (W). Take 4 \u2192 n=3 (W). Both options leave opponent in W. So, n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: Take 1 \u2192 n=7 (L). So, opponent is in L. So, n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: Take 1 \u2192 n=8 (W). Take 4 \u2192 n=5 (L). So, current player can choose to take 4, leaving opponent at L. So, n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: Take 1 \u2192 n=9 (W). Take 4 \u2192 n=6 (W). Both options leave opponent in W. So, n=10 is L.\n\nn=11: Take 1 \u2192 n=10 (L). So, opponent is in L. So, n=11 is W.\n\nn=12: Take 1 \u2192 n=11 (W). Take 4 \u2192 n=8 (W). Both options leave opponent in W. So, n=12 is L.\n\nWait, so the pattern so far is:\n\nn: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\nOut: L W L W W L W L W W L W L\n\nLooking at this, I see a cycle emerging. Let's see the sequence of W and L:\n\nStarting from n=0:\nL, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L...\n\nSo, from n=0, the pattern is L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L,...\n\nHmm, so perhaps the cycle is every 5? Let's see:\n\nPositions:\n\n0: L\n\n1: W\n\n2: L\n\n3: W\n\n4: W\n\n5: L\n\n6: W\n\n7: L\n\n8: W\n\n9: W\n\n10: L\n\n11: W\n\n12: L\n\n13: ?\n\nWait, let's compute n=13.\n\nn=13: Take 1 \u2192 n=12 (L). So, current player can take 1, leaving opponent at L. So, n=13 is W.\n\nn=14: Take 1 \u2192 n=13 (W). Take 4 \u2192 n=10 (L). So, current player can take 4, leaving opponent at L. So, n=14 is W.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the earlier pattern. Hmm, maybe the cycle is longer.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's double-check n=10 to n=14.\n\nn=10: L\n\nn=11: W (take 1 \u2192 n=10 (L))\n\nn=12: L (taking 1 leads to n=11 (W), taking 4 leads to n=8 (W). Both options leave opponent in W. So, n=12 is L.\n\nn=13: take 1 \u2192 n=12 (L). So, current player can force opponent into L. So, n=13 is W.\n\nn=14: take 1 \u2192 n=13 (W). take 4 \u2192 n=10 (L). So, current player can take 4, leaving opponent at L. So, n=14 is W.\n\nn=15: take 1 \u2192 n=14 (W). take 4 \u2192 n=11 (W). So, both options leave opponent in W. So, n=15 is L.\n\nn=16: take 1 \u2192 n=15 (L). So, current player can force opponent into L. So, n=16 is W.\n\nn=17: take 1 \u2192 n=16 (W). take 4 \u2192 n=13 (W). So, both options leave opponent in W. So, n=17 is L.\n\nn=18: take 1 \u2192 n=17 (L). So, current player can force opponent into L. So, n=18 is W.\n\nn=19: take 1 \u2192 n=18 (W). take 4 \u2192 n=15 (L). So, current player can take 4, leaving opponent at L. So, n=19 is W.\n\nn=20: take 1 \u2192 n=19 (W). take 4 \u2192 n=16 (W). So, both options leave opponent in W. So, n=20 is L.\n\nHmm, looking at this, from n=0 to n=20, the pattern is:\n\nL, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L.\n\nWait, so the cycle seems to be repeating every 5? Let's see:\n\nLooking at n=0 to n=4: L, W, L, W, W.\n\nn=5 to n=9: L, W, L, W, W.\n\nn=10 to n=14: L, W, L, W, W.\n\nn=15 to n=19: L, W, L, W, W.\n\nn=20: L.\n\nSo, it's a cycle of 5, where each cycle has L, W, L, W, W. So, every 5 numbers, the pattern repeats.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nn mod 5:\n\nn=0 \u2192 0 \u2192 L\n\nn=1 \u21921 \u2192 W\n\nn=2 \u21922 \u2192 L\n\nn=3 \u21923 \u2192 W\n\nn=4 \u21924 \u2192 W\n\nn=5 \u21920 \u2192 L\n\nn=6 \u21921 \u2192 W\n\nn=7 \u21922 \u2192 L\n\nn=8 \u21923 \u2192 W\n\nn=9 \u21924 \u2192 W\n\nn=10\u21920 \u2192 L\n\nYes, it seems that the outcome depends on n mod 5.\n\nSo, if we categorize based on n mod 5:\n\n- If n mod 5 is 0 \u2192 L\n\n- n mod 5 is 1 \u2192 W\n\n- n mod 5 is 2 \u2192 L\n\n- n mod 5 is 3 \u2192 W\n\n- n mod 5 is 4 \u2192 W\n\nSo, the losing positions (L) are when n \u2261 0 or 2 mod 5.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nn=0: 0 mod5 \u2192 L\n\nn=2: 2 mod5 \u2192 L\n\nn=5: 0 mod5 \u2192 L\n\nn=7: 2 mod5 \u2192 L\n\nn=10:0 mod5\u2192 L\n\nn=12: 2 mod5\u2192 L\n\nn=15:0 mod5\u2192 L\n\nn=17:2 mod5\u2192 L\n\nn=20:0 mod5\u2192 L\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the losing positions are when n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nBut wait, let's confirm with n=17. n=17 mod5 is 2. So, it's a losing position.\n\nAt n=17, the current player can take 1, leaving 16 (W). Or take4, leaving 13 (W). So, opponent can win in both cases. So, n=17 is L, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, n=20 is L, as we saw.\n\nSo, the pattern is that positions where n \u22610 or 2 mod5 are losing positions.\n\nTherefore, for Bob to have a winning strategy, n must be a losing position for Alice, since Alice goes first. So, n must be \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, but let's think again. Because the initial player is Alice, so if the starting position is a losing position, then the current player (Alice) cannot force a win, meaning Bob can.\n\nSo, the number of n \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, we need to count the numbers from 1 to 2024 inclusive where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nLet me compute how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5.\n\nNumbers divisible by 5: floor(2024/5) = 404.8 \u2192 404 numbers.\n\nWait, 5*404=2020, which is \u22642024.\n\nSo, numbers \u22610 mod5: 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5: Let's compute how many.\n\nThe sequence is 2,7,12,..., up to \u22642024.\n\nThe general term is 5k +2.\n\nWhat's the largest k such that 5k +2 \u22642024.\n\n5k \u22642022 \u2192k \u22642022/5=404.4 \u2192k=404.\n\nSo, 5*404 +2=2022 \u22642024.\n\nSo, numbers \u22612 mod5: 405 numbers? Wait, wait.\n\nWait, when k=0: 2\n\nk=1:7\n\n...\n\nk=404: 5*404 +2=2022.\n\nSo, total numbers: 405 (from k=0 to k=404).\n\nWait, 404+1=405.\n\nSo, numbers \u22612 mod5:405.\n\nTherefore, total numbers where n \u22610 or 2 mod5:404 +405=809.\n\nWait, 404 +405=809.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5: from 5*1=5 to 5*404=2020. So, 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5: from 2 to 2022. How many terms?\n\nEach term is 5k +2, where k=0 gives 2, k=1 gives7,... k=404 gives2022. So, 405 terms (k=0 to404).\n\nSo, 405 numbers.\n\nTotal:404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but n starts at 1, so n=0 is excluded. So, for n\u22610 mod5, the numbers are 5,10,...,2020: which is 2020/5=404 numbers.\n\nFor n\u22612 mod5, numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022: as we saw, 405 numbers.\n\nSo, total is 404 +405=809.\n\nSo, the number of n\u22642024 where Bob can force a win is 809.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me confirm that in our earlier analysis, the losing positions for the current player are when n\u22610 or 2 mod5. So, when n is a losing position, the current player cannot force a win. Since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position, Alice can't win, so Bob can.\n\nTherefore, the count is 809.\n\nBut wait, let me check if n=0 is included. The problem says positive integers n, so n starts at 1. So, n=0 is excluded. So, for n\u22610 mod5, the first number is 5, and the last is 2020. So, how many terms?\n\n(2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.\n\nSimilarly, for n\u22612 mod5, starting at 2 and ending at 2022.\n\nNumber of terms: ((2022 -2)/5)+1= (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo, 404 +405=809.\n\nSo, the answer is 809.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the cycle is indeed every 5, as we thought.\n\nLooking back at the initial positions:\n\nn=0: L\n\nn=1: W\n\nn=2: L\n\nn=3: W\n\nn=4: W\n\nn=5: L\n\nn=6: W\n\nn=7: L\n\nn=8: W\n\nn=9: W\n\nn=10:L\n\nn=11:W\n\nn=12:L\n\nn=13:W\n\nn=14:W\n\nn=15:L\n\nn=16:W\n\nn=17:L\n\nn=18:W\n\nn=19:W\n\nn=20:L\n\nYes, the pattern repeats every 5: L, W, L, W, W.\n\nSo, every 5 numbers, the same pattern.\n\nTherefore, the number of losing positions up to n is floor((n+1)/5)*2 + extra.\n\nWait, but for each cycle of 5, there are 2 losing positions (0 and 2 mod5). So, in each block of 5 numbers, 2 are losing.\n\nSo, for n=2024, how many complete blocks of 5 are there?\n\n2024 /5=404.8, so 404 complete blocks, each contributing 2 losing positions: 404*2=808.\n\nBut wait, 404*5=2020. So, the last block is from 2021 to 2024.\n\nIn the last partial block, n=2021,2022,2023,2024.\n\nCheck which of these are losing positions (\u22610 or 2 mod5).\n\nn=2021: 2021 mod5=1 (since 2020 is 0 mod5, 2021 is 1)\n\nn=2022: 2022 mod5=2 \u2192 losing.\n\nn=2023: mod5=3 \u2192 winning.\n\nn=2024: mod5=4 \u2192 winning.\n\nSo, in the last partial block, only n=2022 is a losing position.\n\nSo, total losing positions: 404 blocks *2=808, plus 1 from the last partial block: 809.\n\nSo, that confirms the count is 809.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 809.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nAlice and Bob play a game with a stack of $n$ tokens, taking turns to remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The player who removes the last token wins.

      "full_content": "Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. We need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 give Bob a winning strategy, meaning no matter what Alice does, Bob can win.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as winning or losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, let's model this. Let's define a position as losing if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. Conversely, a position is winning if the current player can force a win.\n\nThe base case is when there are 0 tokens left. If it's your turn and there are 0 tokens, you lose because you can't make a move. So, position 0 is a losing position.\n\nNow, let's consider small values of n and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nn = 1: Alice can take 1 token and win. So, position 1 is a winning position.\n\nn = 2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob can then take that 1 and win. Wait, but that would mean Alice loses. Wait, no, if Alice takes 1, Bob takes the last one and wins. So, if n=2, Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1 and wins. So, Alice would lose. But wait, can Alice make a different move? No, because from n=2, she can only take 1 or 4, but 4 is more than 2, so only 1. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2 is Alice's turn, and she can't force a win, then n=2 is a losing position for the current player (Alice). So, from Alice's perspective, n=2 is a losing position because whatever she does, Bob can win.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Maybe I should think in terms of Grundy numbers or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to list the positions as winning (W) or losing (L) starting from n=0.\n\nLet me try that:\n\nn | outcome (current player can win)\n0 | L (no moves)\n1 | W (take 1)\n2 | ?\n3 | ?\n4 | W (take 4)\n5 | ?\n... etc.\n\nWait, let's go step by step.\n\nn=0: L (current player loses)\n\nn=1: current player can take 1 and win. So W.\n\nn=2: current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent. Since n=1 is a W position for the opponent, the opponent can win. So, the current player at n=2 must take 1, leading to opponent's W. Therefore, n=2 is L? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2 is current player's turn, they can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. Alternatively, can the current player take 4? No, because 4 > 2. So, only move is to take 1. So, the opponent can win, which means the current player at n=2 cannot force a win. So, n=2 is L.\n\nn=3: current player can take 1, leaving n=2 (which is L for opponent). So, if current player takes 1, opponent is at L, meaning current player can win. So, n=3 is W.\n\nn=4: current player can take 4 and win. So, W.\n\nn=5: current player can take 1, leaving n=4 (W for opponent). Or take 4, leaving n=1 (W for opponent). So, whatever current player does, opponent can win. So, n=5 is L.\n\nWait, let me double-check. At n=5, if current player takes 1, opponent is at n=4, which is W for opponent (they can take 4 and win). If current player takes 4, opponent is at n=1, which is W (opponent takes 1 and wins). So, yes, n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: current player can take 1, leaving n=5 (L for opponent). So, current player can force opponent into L. So, n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: current player can take 1, leaving n=6 (W for opponent). Or take 4, leaving n=3 (W for opponent). So, both options lead to opponent's W. Therefore, n=7 is L.\n\nWait, no. Let's check again. At n=7, taking 1 leaves n=6 (W for opponent). Taking 4 leaves n=3 (W for opponent). So, opponent can win in either case. So, n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: current player can take 1, leaving n=7 (L for opponent). So, current player can force opponent into L. So, n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: current player can take 1, leaving n=8 (W). Or take 4, leaving n=5 (L). So, if current player takes 4, opponent is at L. So, n=9 is W.\n\nWait, because taking 4 from 9 leaves 5, which is L, so opponent can't win. So, current player can win by taking 4. Therefore, n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: current player can take 1, leaving n=9 (W). Or take 4, leaving n=6 (W). So, both options lead to opponent's W. So, n=10 is L.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let's see: n=10. If current player takes 1, opponent is at n=9 (W). Opponent can then take 4, leaving 5 (L) for current player. So, current player is forced into L. Alternatively, if current player takes 4 from 10, leaving 6 (W). Opponent can take 1, leaving 5 (L). So, either way, opponent can force current player into L. So, n=10 is L.\n\nn=11: current player can take 1, leaving n=10 (L). So, opponent is at L, meaning current player can win. So, n=11 is W.\n\nn=12: current player can take 1, leaving n=11 (W). Or take 4, leaving n=8 (W). So, both options leave opponent at W. So, n=12 is L.\n\nWait, no. Wait, n=12. Let me think again. If current player takes 1, opponent is at n=11 (W). Opponent can take 1, leaving 10 (L) for current player. Alternatively, if current player takes 4, opponent is at n=8 (W). Opponent can take 4, leaving 4 (W).

So, opponent can win, so n=2 is L.\n\nn=3: Take 1, leaving n=2 (L for opponent). So, W.\n\nn=4: Take 4, so W.\n\nn=5: Take 1 \u2192 n=4 (W). Take 4 \u2192 n=1 (W). Both options leave opponent in W. So, n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: Take 1 \u2192 n=5 (L). So, opponent is in L. So, n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: Take 1 \u2192 n=6 (W). Take 4 \u2192 n=3 (W). Both options leave opponent in W. So, n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: Take 1 \u2192 n=7 (L). So, opponent is in L. So, n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: Take 1 \u2192 n=8 (W). Take 4 \u2192 n=5 (L). So, current player can choose to take 4, leaving opponent at L. So, n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: Take 1 \u2192 n=9 (W). Take 4 \u2192 n=6 (W). Both options leave opponent in W. So, n=10 is L.\n\nn=11: Take 1 \u2192 n=10 (L). So, opponent is in L.

So, current player can take 1, leaving opponent at L. So, n=13 is W.\n\nn=14: Take 1 \u2192 n=13 (W). Take 4 \u2192 n=10 (L). So, current player can take 4, leaving opponent at L. So, n=14 is W.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the earlier pattern. Hmm, maybe the cycle is longer.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's double-check n=10 to n=14.\n\nn=10: L\n\nn=11: W (take 1 \u2192 n=10 (L))\n\nn=12: L (taking 1 leads to n=11 (W), taking 4 leads to n=8 (W). Both options leave opponent in W. So, n=12 is L.\n\nn=13: take 1 \u2192 n=12 (L). So, current player can force opponent into L. So, n=13 is W.\n\nn=14: take 1 \u2192 n=13 (W). take 4 \u2192 n=10 (L). So, current player can take 4, leaving opponent at L. So, n=14 is W.\n\nn=15: take 1 \u2192 n=14 (W). take 4 \u2192 n=11 (W). So, both options leave opponent in W. So, n=15 is L.\n\nn=16: take 1 \u2192 n=15 (L). So, current player can force opponent into L. So, n=16 is W.\n\nn=17: take 1 \u2192 n=16 (W). take 4 \u2192 n=13 (W). So, both options leave opponent in W. So, n=17 is L.\n\nn=18: take 1 \u2192 n=17 (L). So, current player can force opponent into L. So, n=18 is W.\n\nn=19: take 1 \u2192 n=18 (W). take 4 \u2192 n=15 (L). So, current player can take 4, leaving opponent at L. So, n=19 is W.\n\nn=20: take 1 \u2192 n=19 (W). take 4 \u2192 n=16 (W). So, both options leave opponent in W. So, n=20 is L.\n\nHmm, looking at this, from n=0 to n=20, the pattern is:\n\nL, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L.\n\nWait, so the cycle seems to be repeating every 5? Let's see:\n\nLooking at n=0 to n=4: L, W, L, W, W.\n\nn=5 to n=9: L, W, L, W, W.\n\nn=10 to n=14: L, W, L, W, W.\n\nn=15 to n=19: L, W, L, W, W.\n\nn=20: L.\n\nSo, it's a cycle of 5, where each cycle has L, W, L, W, W. So, every 5 numbers, the pattern repeats.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nn mod 5:\n\nn=0 \u2192 0 \u2192 L\n\nn=1 \u21921 \u2192 W\n\nn=2 \u21922 \u2192 L\n\nn=3 \u21923 \u2192 W\n\nn=4 \u21924 \u2192 W\n\nn=5 \u21920 \u2192 L\n\nn=6 \u21921 \u2192 W\n\nn=7 \u21922 \u2192 L\n\nn=8 \u21923 \u2192 W\n\nn=9 \u21924 \u2192 W\n\nn=10\u21920 \u2192 L\n\nYes, it seems that the outcome depends on n mod 5.\n\nSo, if we categorize based on n mod 5:\n\n- If n mod 5 is 0 \u2192 L\n\n- n mod 5 is 1 \u2192 W\n\n- n mod 5 is 2 \u2192 L\n\n- n mod 5 is 3 \u2192 W\n\n- n mod 5 is 4 \u2192 W\n\nSo, the losing positions (L) are when n \u2261 0 or 2 mod 5.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nn=0: 0 mod5 \u2192 L\n\nn=2: 2 mod5 \u2192 L\n\nn=5: 0 mod5 \u2192 L\n\nn=7: 2 mod5 \u2192 L\n\nn=10:0 mod5\u2192 L\n\nn=12: 2 mod5\u2192 L\n\nn=15:0 mod5\u2192 L\n\nn=17:2 mod5\u2192 L\n\nn=20:0 mod5\u2192 L\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the losing positions are when n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nBut wait, let's confirm with n=17. n=17 mod5 is 2. So, it's a losing position.\n\nAt n=17, the current player can take 1, leaving 16 (W). Or take4, leaving 13 (W). So, opponent can win in both cases. So, n=17 is L, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, n=20 is L, as we saw.\n\nSo, the pattern is that positions where n \u22610 or 2 mod5 are losing positions.\n\nTherefore, for Bob to have a winning strategy, n must be a losing position for Alice, since Alice goes first. So, n must be \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, but let's think again. Because the initial player is Alice, so if the starting position is a losing position, then the current player (Alice) cannot force a win, meaning Bob can.\n\nSo, the number of n \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, we need to count the numbers from 1 to 2024 inclusive where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nLet me compute how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5.\n\nNumbers divisible by 5: floor(2024/5) = 404.8 \u2192 404 numbers.\n\nWait, 5*404=2020, which is \u22642024.\n\nSo, numbers \u22610 mod5: 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5: Let's compute how many.\n\nThe sequence is 2,7,12,..., up to \u22642024.\n\nThe general term is 5k +2.\n\nWhat's the largest k such that 5k +2 \u22642024.\n\n5k \u22642022 \u2192k \u22642022/5=404.4 \u2192k=404.\n\nSo, 5*404 +2=2022 \u22642024.\n\nSo, numbers \u22612 mod5: 405 numbers? Wait, wait.\n\nWait, when k=0: 2\n\nk=1:7\n\n...\n\nk=404: 5*404 +2=2022.\n\nSo, total numbers: 405 (from k=0 to k=404).\n\nWait, 404+1=405.\n\nSo, numbers \u22612 mod5:405.\n\nTherefore, total numbers where n \u22610 or 2 mod5:404 +405=809.\n\nWait, 404 +405=809.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5: from 5*1=5 to 5*404=2020. So, 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5: from 2 to 2022. How many terms?\n\nEach term is 5k +2, where k=0 gives 2, k=1 gives7,... k=404 gives2022. So, 405 terms (k=0 to404).\n\nSo, 405 numbers.\n\nTotal:404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but n starts at 1, so n=0 is excluded. So, for n\u22610 mod5, the numbers are 5,10,...,2020: which is 2020/5=404 numbers.\n\nFor n\u22612 mod5, numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022: as we saw, 405 numbers.\n\nSo, total is 404 +405=809.\n\nSo, the number of n\u22642024 where Bob can force a win is 809.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me confirm that in our earlier analysis, the losing positions for the current player are when n\u22610 or 2 mod5. So, when n is a losing position, the current player cannot force a win. Since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position, Alice can't win, so Bob can.\n\nTherefore, the count is 809.\n\nBut wait, let me check if n=0 is included. The problem says positive integers n, so n starts at 1. So, n=0 is excluded. So, for n\u22610 mod5, the first number is 5, and the last is 2020. So, how many terms?\n\n(2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.\n\nSimilarly, for n\u22612 mod5, starting at 2 and ending at 2022.\n\nNumber of terms: ((2022 -2)/5)+1= (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo, 404 +405=809.\n\nSo, the answer is 809.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the cycle is indeed every 5, as we thought.\n\nLooking back at the initial positions:\n\nn=0: L\n\nn=1: W\n\nn=2: L\n\nn=3: W\n\nn=4: W\n\nn=5: L\n\nn=6: W\n\nn=7: L\n\nn=8: W\n\nn=9: W\n\nn=10:L\n\nn=11:W\n\nn=12:L\n\nn=13:W\n\nn=14:W\n\nn=15:L\n\nn=16:W\n\nn=17:L\n\nn=18:W\n\nn=19:W\n\nn=20:L\n\nYes, the pattern repeats every 5: L, W, L, W, W.\n\nSo, every 5 numbers, the same pattern.\n\nTherefore, the number of losing positions up to n is floor((n+1)/5)*2 + extra.\n\nWait, but for each cycle of 5, there are 2 losing positions (0 and 2 mod5). So, in each block of 5 numbers, 2 are losing.\n\nSo, for n=2024, how many complete blocks of 5 are there?\n\n2024 /5=404.8, so 404 complete blocks, each contributing 2 losing positions: 404*2=808.\n\nBut wait, 404*5=2020. So, the last block is from 2021 to 2024.\n\nIn the last partial block, n=2021,2022,2023,2024.\n\nCheck which of these are losing positions (\u22610 or 2 mod5).\n\nn=2021: 2021 mod5=1 (since 2020 is 0 mod5, 2021 is 1)\n\nn=2022: 2022 mod5=2 \u2192 losing.\n\nn=2023: mod5=3 \u2192 winning.\n\nn=2024: mod5=4 \u2192 winning.\n\nSo, in the last partial block, only n=2022 is a losing position.\n\nSo, total losing positions: 404 blocks *2=808, plus 1 from the last partial block: 809.\n\nSo, that confirms the count is 809.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 809.\n\n\nAlice and Bob play a game with a stack of $n$ tokens, taking turns to remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The player who removes the last token wins. We classify positions as winning (W) or losing (L) for the current player. Through analysis, we determine that the losing positions occur when $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ or $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$. \n\nTo find the number of such positions up to $n = 2024$:\n- Numbers $\\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$: There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{2024}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 404$ numbers.\n- Numbers $\\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$: These range from 2 to 2022, yielding $405$ numbers.\n\nThus, there are $404 + 405 = 809$ losing positions where Bob can guarantee a win.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{809}$.",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I remember these involve figuring out winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, the goal is to find all n \u2264 2024 where Bob can force a win, which would mean that n is a losing position for Alice, the first player.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's define positions as either winning (W) or losing (L) for the player about to move.\n\nBase case: n=0. Well, if there are no tokens, the game is over, so the player who just moved has won. So, n=0 is a losing position for the current player because they can't move.\n\nn=1: The current player can take 1 token and win. So, W.\n\nn=2: Take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent. The opponent can then take that 1 and win. Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, current player takes 1, opponent is faced with n=1, which is a winning position for them. So, current player can't force a win by taking 1. What about taking 4? Can't do that because n=2 <4. So, current player can't move to a losing position for the opponent. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position? Wait, but wait, n=2: current player can take 1, leaving 1, which is a W for the opponent. So, the current player can't force a loss on the opponent, so n=2 must be a losing position for the current player. Hmm, but wait, if the current player can't win, then n=2 is L.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in n=1, the current player takes 1 and wins. So, n=1 is W.\n\nn=2: current player can take 1, leaving 1, which is a W for the opponent. So, opponent can win from there. So, current player can't force a win. So n=2 is L.\n\nn=3: current player can take 1, leaving 2, which is L for the opponent. Because n=2 is L, so the opponent can't win from there. Therefore, n=3 is W.\n\nn=4: current player can take 4 and win. So, n=4 is W.\n\nn=5: current player can take 1, leaving 4, which is W for the opponent. Or take 4, leaving 1, which is W for the opponent. So, no matter what the current player does, the opponent can win. So, n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: current player can take 1, leaving 5, which is L. So, opponent is in a losing position. Therefore, n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: current player can take 1, leaving 6 (W), or take 4, leaving 3 (W). Wait, so both options leave the opponent in W positions. So, n=7 is L?\n\nWait, no. Wait, if n=7, current player can take 1, leaving 6, which is W for opponent. Or take 4, leaving 3, which is W for opponent. So, the current player can't force the opponent into an L position. Therefore, n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: current player can take 1, leaving 7 (L), so opponent is in L. So, n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: current player can take 1, leaving 8 (W) or take 4, leaving 5 (L). So, the current player can choose to leave the opponent in L by taking 4. Therefore, n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: current player can take 1, leaving 9 (W), or take 4, leaving 6 (W). So, both options leave opponent in W. So, n=10 is L.\n\nHmm, I see a pattern emerging. Let's list these out:\n\nn | Position (W/L)\n0 | L\n1 | W\n2 | L\n3 | W\n4 | W\n5 | L\n6 | W\n7 | L\n8 | W\n9 | W\n10| L\n\nWait, so the pattern seems to be every 5 numbers, starting from n=0:\n\nn=0: L\n\nn=1: W\n\nn=2: L\n\nn=3: W\n\nn=4: W\n\nn=5: L\n\nn=6: W\n\nn=7: L\n\nn=8: W\n\nn=9: W\n\nn=10: L\n\nn=11: W\n\nn=12: L\n\nn=13: W\n\nn=14: W\n\nn=15: L\n\nSo, the losing positions are n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,... which seems like every 3 numbers or so. Wait, 0, 2,5,7,10,12,15...\n\nWait, let's see the differences between the losing positions:\n\nFrom 0 to 2: +2\n\n2 to 5: +3\n\n5 to 7: +2\n\n7 to 10: +3\n\n10 to12: +2\n\n12 to15: +3\n\nSo, alternates between adding 2 and 3.\n\nSo, the losing positions are numbers that are 0 mod 5? Wait, no.\n\nWait, n=0: 0\n\nn=2: 2\n\nn=5:5\n\nn=7:7\n\nn=10:10\n\nn=12:12\n\nn=15:15\n\nWait, so 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,...\n\nWait, 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,... etc.\n\nHmm, it's like every 5 numbers, starting at 0, then adding 2, then 3, then 2, then 3, etc.\n\nSo, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0,2, or 3 mod 5? Wait, no.\n\nWait, n=0 mod5 is 0,5,10,15,20,... but in our list, 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,...\n\nWait, perhaps they are numbers that are 0 mod5, or 2 mod5, or 3 mod5? Let's see:\n\n0 mod5: 0,5,10,15,20,...\n\n2 mod5:2,7,12,17,22,27,...\n\n3 mod5:3,8,13,18,23,28,...\n\nWait, but in our losing positions, we have 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,...\n\nSo, the losing positions are the union of 0 mod5 and 2 mod5 and 3 mod5? Wait, no. Because 3 mod5 is 3,8,13, etc., but in our list, n=3 is a winning position, not a losing one. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's a different modulus. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the losing positions: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,...\n\nLet me see what these numbers have in common. Let's subtract 2:\n\n0-2= -2\n\n2-2=0\n\n5-2=3\n\n7-2=5\n\n10-2=8\n\n12-2=10\n\n15-2=13\n\n17-2=15\n\n20-2=18\n\n22-2=20\n\n25-2=23\n\n27-2=25\n\nHmm, not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's modulo 5. Let's see:\n\n0 mod5:0\n\n2 mod5:2\n\n5 mod5:0\n\n7 mod5:2\n\n10 mod5:0\n\n12 mod5:2\n\n15 mod5:0\n\n17 mod5:2\n\n20 mod5:0\n\n22 mod5:2\n\n25 mod5:0\n\n27 mod5:2\n\nSo, the losing positions are numbers where n mod5 is 0 or 2. Because 0,2,5 (0),7(2),10(0),12(2), etc.\n\nWait, but wait, let's check n=5:5 mod5=0, which is a losing position.\n\nn=7:7 mod5=2, losing.\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0, losing.\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2, losing.\n\nn=15:15 mod5=0, losing.\n\nYes, so the losing positions are the numbers where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nWait, but n=0 is a losing position, which is 0 mod5.\n\nSo, in that case, for n\u22650, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nBut wait, let's check n=3:3 mod5=3, which is a winning position, correct.\n\nn=4:4 mod5=4, winning.\n\nn=1:1 mod5=1, winning.\n\nn=6:6 mod5=1, winning.\n\nn=8:8 mod5=3, winning.\n\nn=9:9 mod5=4, winning.\n\nn=11:11 mod5=1, winning.\n\nn=13:13 mod5=3, winning.\n\nn=14:14 mod5=4, winning.\n\nn=16:16 mod5=1, winning.\n\nn=18:18 mod5=3, winning.\n\nn=19:19 mod5=4, winning.\n\nn=21:21 mod5=1, winning.\n\nn=23:23 mod5=3, winning.\n\nn=24:24 mod5=4, winning.\n\nn=26:26 mod5=1, winning.\n\nn=28:28 mod5=3, winning.\n\nn=29:29 mod5=4, winning.\n\nSo, yes, the losing positions are n where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nTherefore, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, for Bob to have a winning strategy, n must be a losing position for Alice, which is when n is 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nBut wait, n=0 is not a positive integer, so we're looking at n=2,5,7,10,12,15,... etc.\n\nSo, we need to count the numbers \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the number of such n is equal to the number of integers \u22642024 that are congruent to 0 mod5 plus the number congruent to 2 mod5.\n\nLet me compute how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5.\n\nThe largest multiple of 5 \u22642024 is 2020, which is 5\u00d7404=2020. So, the count is 404 numbers (from 5\u00d71=5 up to 5\u00d7404=2020).\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5: The smallest is 2, then 7,12,... up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nWhat is the largest number \u22642024 that is \u22612 mod5?\n\n2024 divided by 5: 2024 \u00f75=404.8. So, 5\u00d7404=2020. 2020 +2=2022, which is \u22642024. So, 2022 is the largest.\n\nSo, the numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with first term a=2, common difference d=5, last term l=2022.\n\nThe number of terms is ((2022 -2)/5)+1 = (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.\n\nSo, 405 numbers \u22612 mod5.\n\nSo, total losing positions: 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5) = 809.\n\nWait, but wait: Let me double-check.\n\nWait, for 0 mod5: numbers from 5 to 2020, inclusive.\n\nNumber of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.\n\nYes.\n\nFor 2 mod5: numbers from 2 to 2022, inclusive.\n\nNumber of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo, total is 404+405=809.\n\nSo, the answer is 809.\n\nWait, but let me think again: in the initial analysis, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nBut let me test this for a few more numbers to make sure.\n\nn=0: L\n\nn=1: W\n\nn=2: L\n\nn=3: W\n\nn=4: W\n\nn=5: L\n\nn=6: W\n\nn=7: L\n\nn=8: W\n\nn=9: W\n\nn=10: L\n\nn=11: W\n\nn=12: L\n\nn=13: W\n\nn=14: W\n\nn=15: L\n\nn=16: W\n\nn=17: L\n\nn=18: W\n\nn=19: W\n\nn=20: L\n\nYes, seems consistent.\n\nSo, the number of n \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5 is 404 +405=809.\n\nThus, the answer is 809.\n",

This sequence has 405 numbers.\n\nAdding these, the total number of losing positions is $404 + 405 = 809$.\n\nThus, the number of positive integers $n \\leq 2024$ where Bob can guarantee a win is $\\boxed{809}$.",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I remember these involve figuring out winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, the goal is to find all n \u2264 2024 where Bob can force a win, which would mean that n is a losing position for Alice, the first player.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's define positions as either winning (W) or losing (L) for the player about to move.\n\nBase case: n=0. Well, if there are no tokens, the game is over, so the player who just moved has won. So, n=0 is a losing position for the current player because they can't move.\n\nn=1: The current player can take 1 token and win. So, W.\n\nn=2: Take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent. The opponent can then take that 1 and win. Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, current player takes 1, opponent is faced with n=1, which is a winning position for them. So, current player can't force a win by taking 1. What about taking 4? Can't do that because n=2 <4. So, current player can't move to a losing position for the opponent. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position? Wait, but wait, n=2: current player can take 1, leaving 1, which is a W for the opponent. So, the current player can't force a loss on the opponent, so n=2 must be a losing position for the current player. Hmm, but wait, if the current player can't win, then n=2 is L.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in n=1, the current player takes 1 and wins. So, n=1 is W.\n\nn=2: current player can take 1, leaving 1, which is a W for the opponent. So, opponent can win from there. So, current player can't force a win. So n=2 is L.\n\nn=3: current player can take 1, leaving 2, which is L for the opponent. Because n=2 is L, so the opponent can't win from there. Therefore, n=3 is W.\n\nn=4: current player can take 4 and win. So, n=4 is W.\n\nn=5: current player can take 1, leaving 4, which is W for the opponent. Or take 4, leaving 1, which is W for the opponent. So, no matter what the current player does, the opponent can win. So, n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: current player can take 1, leaving 5, which is L. So, opponent is in a losing position. Therefore, n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: current player can take 1, leaving 6 (W), or take 4, leaving 3 (W). Wait, so both options leave the opponent in W positions. So, n=7 is L?\n\nWait, no. Wait, if n=7, current player can take 1, leaving 6, which is W for opponent. Or take 4, leaving 3, which is W for opponent. So, the current player can't force the opponent into an L position. Therefore, n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: current player can take 1, leaving 7 (L), so opponent is in L. So, n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: current player can take 1, leaving 8 (W) or take 4, leaving 5 (L). So, the current player can choose to leave the opponent in L by taking 4. Therefore, n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: current player can take 1, leaving 9 (W), or take 4, leaving 6 (W). So, both options leave opponent in W. So, n=10 is L.\n\nHmm, I see a pattern emerging. Let's list these out:\n\nn | Position (W/L)\n0 | L\n1 | W\n2 | L\n3 | W\n4 | W\n5 | L\n6 | W\n7 | L\n8 | W\n9 | W\n10| L\n\nWait, so the pattern seems to be every 5 numbers, starting from n=0:\n\nn=0: L\n\nn=1: W\n\nn=2: L\n\nn=3: W\n\nn=4: W\n\nn=5: L\n\nn=6: W\n\nn=7: L\n\nn=8: W\n\nn=9: W\n\nn=10: L\n\nn=11: W\n\nn=12: L\n\nn=13: W\n\nn=14: W\n\nn=15: L\n\nSo, the losing positions are n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,... which seems like every 3 numbers or so. Wait, 0, 2,5,7,10,12,15...\n\nWait, let's see the differences between the losing positions:\n\nFrom 0 to 2: +2\n\n2 to 5: +3\n\n5 to 7: +2\n\n7 to 10: +3\n\n10 to12: +2\n\n12 to15: +3\n\nSo, alternates between adding 2 and 3.\n\nSo, the losing positions are numbers that are 0 mod 5? Wait, no.\n\nWait, n=0: 0\n\nn=2: 2\n\nn=5:5\n\nn=7:7\n\nn=10:10\n\nn=12:12\n\nn=15:15\n\nWait, so 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,...\n\nWait, 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,... etc.\n\nHmm, it's like every 5 numbers, starting at 0, then adding 2, then 3, then 2, then 3, etc.\n\nSo, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0,2, or 3 mod 5? Wait, no.\n\nWait, n=0 mod5 is 0,5,10,15,20,... but in our list, 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,...\n\nWait, perhaps they are numbers that are 0 mod5, or 2 mod5, or 3 mod5? Let's see:\n\n0 mod5: 0,5,10,15,20,...\n\n2 mod5:2,7,12,17,22,27,...\n\n3 mod5:3,8,13,18,23,28,...\n\nWait, but in our losing positions, we have 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,...\n\nSo, the losing positions are the union of 0 mod5 and 2 mod5 and 3 mod5? Wait, no. Because 3 mod5 is 3,8,13, etc., but in our list, n=3 is a winning position, not a losing one. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's a different modulus. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the losing positions: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,...\n\nLet me see what these numbers have in common. Let's subtract 2:\n\n0-2= -2\n\n2-2=0\n\n5-2=3\n\n7-2=5\n\n10-2=8\n\n12-2=10\n\n15-2=13\n\n17-2=15\n\n20-2=18\n\n22-2=20\n\n25-2=23\n\n27-2=25\n\nHmm, not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's modulo 5. Let's see:\n\n0 mod5:0\n\n2 mod5:2\n\n5 mod5:0\n\n7 mod5:2\n\n10 mod5:0\n\n12 mod5:2\n\n15 mod5:0\n\n17 mod5:2\n\n20 mod5:0\n\n22 mod5:2\n\n25 mod5:0\n\n27 mod5:2\n\nSo, the losing positions are numbers where n mod5 is 0 or 2. Because 0,2,5 (0),7(2),10(0),12(2), etc.\n\nWait, but wait, let's check n=5:5 mod5=0, which is a losing position.\n\nn=7:7 mod5=2, losing.\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0, losing.\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2, losing.\n\nn=15:15 mod5=0, losing.\n\nYes, so the losing positions are the numbers where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nWait, but n=0 is a losing position, which is 0 mod5.\n\nSo, in that case, for n\u22650, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nBut wait, let's check n=3:3 mod5=3, which is a winning position, correct.\n\nn=4:4 mod5=4, winning.\n\nn=1:1 mod5=1, winning.\n\nn=6:6 mod5=1, winning.\n\nn=8:8 mod5=3, winning.\n\nn=9:9 mod5=4, winning.\n\nn=11:11 mod5=1, winning.\n\nn=13:13 mod5=3, winning.\n\nn=14:14 mod5=4, winning.\n\nn=16:16 mod5=1, winning.\n\nn=18:18 mod5=3, winning.\n\nn=19:19 mod5=4, winning.\n\nn=21:21 mod5=1, winning.\n\nn=23:23 mod5=3, winning.\n\nn=24:24 mod5=4, winning.\n\nn=26:26 mod5=1, winning.\n\nn=28:28 mod5=3, winning.\n\nn=29:29 mod5=4, winning.\n\nSo, yes, the losing positions are n where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nTherefore, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, for Bob to have a winning strategy, n must be a losing position for Alice, which is when n is 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nBut wait, n=0 is not a positive integer, so we're looking at n=2,5,7,10,12,15,... etc.\n\nSo, we need to count the numbers \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the number of such n is equal to the number of integers \u22642024 that are congruent to 0 mod5 plus the number congruent to 2 mod5.\n\nLet me compute how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5.\n\nThe largest multiple of 5 \u22642024 is 2020, which is 5\u00d7404=2020. So, the count is 404 numbers (from 5\u00d71=5 up to 5\u00d7404=2020).\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5: The smallest is 2, then 7,12,... up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nWhat is the largest number \u22642024 that is \u22612 mod5?\n\n2024 divided by 5: 2024 \u00f75=404.8. So, 5\u00d7404=2020. 2020 +2=2022, which is \u22642024. So, 2022 is the largest.\n\nSo, the numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with first term a=2, common difference d=5, last term l=2022.\n\nThe number of terms is ((2022 -2)/5)+1 = (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.\n\nSo, 405 numbers \u22612 mod5.\n\nSo, total losing positions: 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5) = 809.\n\nWait, but wait: Let me double-check.\n\nWait, for 0 mod5: numbers from 5 to 2020, inclusive.\n\nNumber of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.\n\nYes.\n\nFor 2 mod5: numbers from 2 to 2022, inclusive.\n\nNumber of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo, total is 404+405=809.\n\nSo, the answer is 809.\n\nWait, but let me think again: in the initial analysis, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nBut let me test this for a few more numbers to make sure.\n\nn=0: L\n\nn=1: W\n\nn=2: L\n\nn=3: W\n\nn=4: W\n\nn=5: L\n\nn=6: W\n\nn=7: L\n\nn=8: W\n\nn=9: W\n\nn=10: L\n\nn=11: W\n\nn=12: L\n\nn=13: W\n\nn=14: W\n\nn=15: L\n\nn=16: W\n\nn=17: L\n\nn=18: W\n\nn=19: W\n\nn=20: L\n\nYes, seems consistent.\n\nSo, the number of n \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5 is 404 +405=809.\n\nThus, the answer is 809.\n\n\nAlice and Bob play a game with a stack of $n$ tokens, taking turns to remove either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first, and the player who removes the last token wins. To determine the number of positive integers $n \\leq 2024$ where Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game using combinatorial game theory.\n\nWe define positions as either winning (W) or losing (L) for the current player. A losing position means the current player cannot force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, let me start by understanding the game mechanics. It's a turn-based game with two players, Alice and Bob. Alice goes first. Each turn, a player can remove 1 or 4 tokens. The player who takes the last token wins. So, the goal is to be the one to take the last token.\n\nI think this is similar to other impartial games like Nim, where the key is to determine winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win regardless of the opponent's moves. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, the first step is to figure out for each n whether it's a winning or losing position. Let's denote the positions as either Winning (W) or Losing (L). \n\nLet's start from the bottom and work our way up. \n\nn=0: Well, if there are no tokens left, the game is over. But since the last token was taken by the previous player, the current player can't make a move. So, n=0 is a losing position because the player whose turn it is can't do anything. So, for n=0, it's an L.\n\nn=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So, n=1 is a W.\n\nn=2: The player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent. The opponent can then take that 1 and win. Wait, no, if I take 1 from 2, leaving 1, then the opponent takes 1 and wins. So that's bad. Alternatively, can I take 4? No, because there's only 2 tokens. So, for n=2, the only move is to take 1, leading to the opponent winning. Therefore, n=2 is an L.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. If I'm at n=2, I take 1, leaving 1. Then the opponent takes 1 and wins. So, n=2 is a losing position because whatever I do, the opponent can win. So, n=2 is L.\n\nn=3: Let's see. If I take 1, leaving 2, which is an L position. So, the opponent is in a losing position, which means I can force them to lose. So, n=3 is a W.\n\nn=4: I can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So, n=4 is W.\n\nn=5: Let's think. If I take 1, leaving 4, which is a W for the opponent because they can take all 4 and win. Alternatively, if I take 4, leaving 1, which is a W for the opponent as they take the last one. So, no matter what I do, the opponent can win. So, n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: If I take 1, leaving 5, which is L. So, opponent is in a losing position. So, n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: If I take 1, leaving 6 (W), opponent can win. If I take 4, leaving 3 (W), opponent can take 1 and win. Wait, no. Let's see: from 3, the opponent can take 1, leaving 2, which is L. So, the opponent can force me into a losing position. Hmm, so if I take 4 from 7, leaving 3, opponent can take 1, leaving 2, which is L. So, opponent can win. Alternatively, if I take 1, leaving 6, opponent can take 1, leaving 5, which is L. So, opponent can win either way. So, n=7 is L.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me try to re-examine n=7.\n\nAt n=7, possible moves are to 6 or 3.\n\nIf I move to 6 (n=6 is W), then the opponent is in a W position, so they can win.\n\nIf I move to 3 (n=3 is W), opponent can take 1, leaving 2, which is L, so opponent can win.\n\nSo, no matter what I do, opponent can win. Therefore, n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: If I take 1, leaving 7 (L). So, opponent is in a losing position. Therefore, n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: If I take 1, leaving 8 (W). If I take 4, leaving 5 (L). So, I can choose to take 4, leaving 5, which is L. So, opponent is in a losing position. Therefore, n=9 is W.\n\nWait, because if I take 4 from 9, leaving 5 (L), so opponent can't win. So, n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: Let's see. If I take 1, leaving 9 (W). If I take 4, leaving 6 (W). So, both options leave opponent in a W position. So, n=10 is L.\n\nWait, so for n=10, regardless of whether I take 1 or 4, opponent can win. So, n=10 is L.\n\nHmm, so let's try to list these out so far:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nW/L: L W L W W L W L W W L\n\nWait, let me confirm each step again.\n\nn=0: L\n\nn=1: W (take 1, win)\n\nn=2: Only can take 1, leaving 1 for opponent to win. So, L.\n\nn=3: Take 1, leaving 2 (L) for opponent. So, W.\n\nn=4: Take 4, win. So, W.\n\nn=5: If take 1, opponent gets 4 (W). If take 4, opponent gets 1 (W). So, L.\n\nn=6: Take 1, opponent gets 5 (L). So, W.\n\nn=7: Take 1, opponent gets 6 (W). Take 4, opponent gets 3 (W). So, L.\n\nn=8: Take 1, opponent gets 7 (L). So, W.\n\nn=9: Take 4, opponent gets 5 (L). So, W.\n\nn=10: Take 1, opponent gets 9 (W). Take 4, opponent gets 6 (W). So, L.\n\nSo the pattern so far is L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L.\n\nHmm, trying to see a pattern here. Let's see if there's a cycle or periodicity.\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n\nn: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16...\n\nW/L: L W L W W L W L W W L W L W W L W L...\n\nWait, let me compute a few more to see.\n\nn=11: Can I take 1, leaving 10 (L), so opponent is in L. So, n=11 is W.\n\nn=12: Take 1, leaving 11 (W). Take 4, leaving 8 (W). So, both options lead to opponent W. So, n=12 is L.\n\nn=13: Take 1, leaving 12 (L). So, n=13 is W.\n\nn=14: Take 4, leaving 10 (L). So, n=14 is W.\n\nn=15: Take 1, leaving 14 (W). Take 4, leaving 11 (W). So, n=15 is L.\n\nn=16: Take 1, leaving 15 (L). So, W.\n\nn=17: Take 4, leaving 13 (W). Wait, no, if I take 4 from 17, I leave 13 (W). So, opponent can take 1, leaving 12 (L). Hmm, that's bad. Alternatively, if I take 1 from 17, leaving 16 (W). So, opponent can take 1, leaving 15 (L). So, regardless of what I do, opponent can force me into L. So, n=17 is L?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think differently. Wait, n=17: can I take 1, leaving 16 (W). Then opponent can take 1, leaving 15 (L). So, opponent can win. Alternatively, if I take 4, leaving 13 (W). Opponent can take 1, leaving 12 (L). So, opponent can win again. So, n=17 is L.\n\nWait, but earlier n=13 is W, so if I take 4, opponent gets 13 (W), which is good for them, but bad for me. So, n=17 is L.\n\nn=18: Take 1, leaving 17 (L). So, W.\n\nn=19: Take 4, leaving 15 (L). So, W.\n\nn=20: Take 1, leaving 19 (W). Take 4, leaving 16 (W). So, both options lead to opponent W. So, n=20 is L.\n\nWait, so the sequence so far is:\n\nn: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n\nW/L: L W L W W L W L W W L W L W W L W L W W L\n\nLooking at this, I can see a pattern that every 5 numbers, the cycle repeats? Let's see.\n\nFrom n=0 to n=5: L, W, L, W, W, L\n\nn=6 to n=10: W, L, W, W, L\n\nn=11 to n=15: W, L, W, W, L\n\nWait, no, that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cycle is every 5 numbers, but the starting point shifts.\n\nWait, let's check from n=0:\n\n0: L\n\n1: W\n\n2: L\n\n3: W\n\n4: W\n\n5: L\n\n6: W\n\n7: L\n\n8: W\n\n9: W\n\n10: L\n\n11: W\n\n12: L\n\n13: W\n\n14: W\n\n15: L\n\n16: W\n\n17: L\n\n18: W\n\n19: W\n\n20: L\n\nSo, the sequence is L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L...\n\nSo, the pattern seems to be L, W, L, W, W, and then repeats. Let me check:\n\nFrom n=0: positions 0-4: L, W, L, W, W\n\nn=5: L\n\nn=6: W (same as n=1)\n\nn=7: L (same as n=2)\n\nn=8: W (same as n=3)\n\nn=9: W (same as n=4)\n\nn=10: L (same as n=5)\n\nSo, it's a cycle of 5, but shifted. Wait, no, because n=5 is L, n=6 is W, which is similar to n=1, so perhaps the cycle is 5.\n\nBut let me think in terms of modulo. Let's see for each n, what is n mod 5.\n\nn=0: 0 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=1:1 \u2192 W\n\nn=2:2 \u2192 L\n\nn=3:3 \u2192 W\n\nn=4:4 \u2192 W\n\nn=5:0 \u2192 L\n\nn=6:1 \u2192 W\n\nn=7:2 \u2192 L\n\nn=8:3 \u2192 W\n\nn=9:4 \u2192 W\n\nn=10:0 \u2192 L\n\nSo, n mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn mod5=1 \u2192 W\n\nn mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn mod5=3 \u2192 W\n\nn mod5=4 \u2192 W\n\nSo, the pattern is: if n mod5 is 0, 2, or 3, then it's L? Wait, no.\n\nWait, no, from n=0 to n=4:\n\nn mod5: 0 \u2192 L\n\n1 \u2192 W\n\n2 \u2192 L\n\n3 \u2192 W\n\n4 \u2192 W\n\nThen n=5 (0 mod5) \u2192 L\n\nn=6 (1 mod5) \u2192 W\n\nn=7 (2 mod5) \u2192 L\n\nn=8 (3 mod5) \u2192 W\n\nn=9 (4 mod5) \u2192 W\n\nSo, the pattern is that when n mod5 is 0, it's L; when it's 1 or 3, it's W; when it's 2 or 4, it's L? Wait, no:\n\nWait, n mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn mod5=1 \u2192 W\n\nn mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn mod5=3 \u2192 W\n\nn mod5=4 \u2192 W\n\nWait, so it's:\n\nn mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn mod5=1 \u2192 W\n\nn mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn mod5=3 \u2192 W\n\nn mod5=4 \u2192 W\n\nSo, for n mod5=0,2,3: Wait no, n mod5=0 is L, n mod5=2 is L, n mod5=3 is W. Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nLooking at the initial sequence:\n\nn=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=5 \u2192 L\n\nn=7 \u2192 L\n\nn=10 \u2192 L\n\nn=12 \u2192 L\n\nn=15 \u2192 L\n\nn=17 \u2192 L\n\nn=20 \u2192 L\n\nSo, the losing positions are n where n mod5=0 or 2.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nn=0 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=2 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=5 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=7 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=10 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=12 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=15 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=17 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=20 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nYes, so the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, but let's check n=3: n=3 mod5=3 \u2192 W\n\nn=4 mod5=4 \u2192 W\n\nn=1 mod5=1 \u2192 W\n\nn=6 mod5=1 \u2192 W\n\nn=8 mod5=3 \u2192 W\n\nn=9 mod5=4 \u2192 W\n\nSo, yes, the losing positions are when n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, for n \u22610 or 2 mod5, the position is losing.\n\nThus, in the game, if n is 0 or 2 mod5, the current player cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.\n\nWait, but wait: in the initial analysis, n=5 is L, which is 0 mod5. n=7 is 2 mod5, which is L. So yes, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, in the game, if the starting number n is a losing position, then the second player (Bob) can win. Because Alice starts first, and if n is a losing position, Bob can always respond to Alice's moves in such a way to bring the game back to a losing position for Alice.\n\nWait, let me think about that. If n is a losing position, then the player whose turn it is cannot win. Since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position, Bob can always win.\n\nSo, the number of losing positions n \u22642024 is the number of n where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, we need to count how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, find the total numbers \u22610 mod5 \u22642024.\n\nThe largest multiple of 5 \u22642024 is 2020 (since 2024 \u00f75=404.8, so 5\u00d7404=2020).\n\nSo, numbers: 5,10,15,...,2020.\n\nNumber of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1= 403 +1=404.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5 \u22642024.\n\nThe sequence is 2,7,12,..., up to the largest number \u22642024.\n\nWhat's the largest number \u22642024 that is \u22612 mod5?\n\n2024 \u00f75=404.8, so 5\u00d7404=2020. 2020+2=2022.\n\nSo, the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nNumber of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1= (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo, total losing positions are 404 (for mod5=0) +405 (for mod5=2)= 809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nNumber of terms \u22610 mod5: from 5 to 2020.\n\nNumber of terms: floor(2024/5)=404 (since 5\u00d7404=2020). So, 404 terms.\n\nSimilarly, for \u22612 mod5: from 2 to 2022.\n\nNumber of terms: let's see, 2 +5(k-1)=2022 \u2192 5(k-1)=2020 \u2192 k-1=404 \u2192 k=405.\n\nSo, 405 terms.\n\nThus, total losing positions: 404 +405=809.\n\nBut wait, n starts from 1. Wait, n=0 is a losing position, but the problem says positive integers n \u22642024. So, n starts at 1. So, n=0 is excluded.\n\nSo, for mod5=0: numbers 5,10,...,2020. So, 404 numbers.\n\nFor mod5=2: numbers 2,7,...,2022. So, 405 numbers.\n\nSo, total losing positions are 404 +405=809.\n\nBut wait, is 2022 \u22642024? Yes.\n\nWait, but let me check 2022: 2022 \u00f75=404.4, so 5\u00d7404=2020, plus 2 is 2022.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, the number of n \u22642024 where Bob can force a win is 809.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because if n is a losing position, then Bob can win. So, the number of such n is 809.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm the initial analysis about the losing positions.\n\nEarlier, I thought that the losing positions are n\u22610 or 2 mod5. Let me check with n=5: yes, L; n=7: yes, L; n=10: yes, L; n=12: yes, L; n=15: yes, L; n=17: yes, L; n=20: yes, L.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of losing positions is 809.\n\nSo, the answer is 809.\n\nBut wait, let me re-examine the initial step where n=0 is considered a losing position. Since the problem states positive integers n, n=0 is not included. So, for mod5=0, numbers start at 5, which is correct. For mod5=2, numbers start at 2, which is included as a positive integer. So, the counts are correct.\n\nThus, the total number is 404 +405=809.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game using the concept of winning (W) and losing (L) positions.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, let me start by understanding the game mechanics. It's a turn-based game with two players, Alice and Bob. Alice goes first. Each turn, a player can remove 1 or 4 tokens. The player who takes the last token wins. So, the goal is to be the one to take the last token.\n\nI think this is similar to other impartial games like Nim, where the key is to determine winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win regardless of the opponent's moves. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, the first step is to figure out for each n whether it's a winning or losing position. Let's denote the positions as either Winning (W) or Losing (L). \n\nLet's start from the bottom and work our way up. \n\nn=0: Well, if there are no tokens left, the game is over. But since the last token was taken by the previous player, the current player can't make a move. So, n=0 is a losing position because the player whose turn it is can't do anything. So, for n=0, it's an L.\n\nn=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So, n=1 is a W.\n\nn=2: The player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent. The opponent can then take that 1 and win. Wait, no, if I take 1 from 2, leaving 1, then the opponent takes 1 and wins. So that's bad. Alternatively, can I take 4? No, because there's only 2 tokens. So, for n=2, the only move is to take 1, leading to the opponent winning. Therefore, n=2 is an L.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. If I'm at n=2, I take 1, leaving 1. Then the opponent takes 1 and wins. So, n=2 is a losing position because whatever I do, the opponent can win. So, n=2 is L.\n\nn=3: Let's see. If I take 1, leaving 2, which is an L position. So, the opponent is in a losing position, which means I can force them to lose. So, n=3 is a W.\n\nn=4: I can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So, n=4 is W.\n\nn=5: Let's think. If I take 1, leaving 4, which is a W for the opponent because they can take all 4 and win. Alternatively, if I take 4, leaving 1, which is a W for the opponent as they take the last one. So, no matter what I do, the opponent can win. So, n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: If I take 1, leaving 5, which is L. So, opponent is in a losing position. So, n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: If I take 1, leaving 6 (W), opponent can win. If I take 4, leaving 3 (W), opponent can take 1 and win. Wait, no. Let's see: from 3, the opponent can take 1, leaving 2, which is L. So, the opponent can force me into a losing position. Hmm, so if I take 4 from 7, leaving 3, opponent can take 1, leaving 2, which is L. So, opponent can win. Alternatively, if I take 1, leaving 6, opponent can take 1, leaving 5, which is L. So, opponent can win either way. So, n=7 is L.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me try to re-examine n=7.\n\nAt n=7, possible moves are to 6 or 3.\n\nIf I move to 6 (n=6 is W), then the opponent is in a W position, so they can win.\n\nIf I move to 3 (n=3 is W), opponent can take 1, leaving 2, which is L, so opponent can win.\n\nSo, no matter what I do, opponent can win. Therefore, n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: If I take 1, leaving 7 (L). So, opponent is in a losing position. Therefore, n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: If I take 1, leaving 8 (W). If I take 4, leaving 5 (L). So, I can choose to take 4, leaving 5, which is L. So, opponent is in a losing position. Therefore, n=9 is W.\n\nWait, because if I take 4 from 9, leaving 5 (L), so opponent can't win. So, n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: Let's see. If I take 1, leaving 9 (W). If I take 4, leaving 6 (W). So, both options leave opponent in a W position. So, n=10 is L.\n\nWait, so for n=10, regardless of whether I take 1 or 4, opponent can win. So, n=10 is L.\n\nHmm, so let's try to list these out so far:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nW/L: L W L W W L W L W W L\n\nWait, let me confirm each step again.\n\nn=0: L\n\nn=1: W (take 1, win)\n\nn=2: Only can take 1, leaving 1 for opponent to win. So, L.\n\nn=3: Take 1, leaving 2 (L) for opponent. So, W.\n\nn=4: Take 4, win. So, W.\n\nn=5: If take 1, opponent gets 4 (W). If take 4, opponent gets 1 (W). So, L.\n\nn=6: Take 1, opponent gets 5 (L). So, W.\n\nn=7: Take 1, opponent gets 6 (W). Take 4, opponent gets 3 (W). So, L.\n\nn=8: Take 1, opponent gets 7 (L). So, W.\n\nn=9: Take 4, opponent gets 5 (L). So, W.\n\nn=10: Take 1, opponent gets 9 (W). Take 4, opponent gets 6 (W). So, L.\n\nSo the pattern so far is L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L.\n\nHmm, trying to see a pattern here. Let's see if there's a cycle or periodicity.\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n\nn: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16...\n\nW/L: L W L W W L W L W W L W L W W L W L...\n\nWait, let me compute a few more to see.\n\nn=11: Can I take 1, leaving 10 (L), so opponent is in L. So, n=11 is W.\n\nn=12: Take 1, leaving 11 (W). Take 4, leaving 8 (W). So, both options lead to opponent W. So, n=12 is L.\n\nn=13: Take 1, leaving 12 (L). So, n=13 is W.\n\nn=14: Take 4, leaving 10 (L). So, n=14 is W.\n\nn=15: Take 1, leaving 14 (W). Take 4, leaving 11 (W). So, n=15 is L.\n\nn=16: Take 1, leaving 15 (L). So, W.\n\nn=17: Take 4, leaving 13 (W). Wait, no, if I take 4 from 17, I leave 13 (W). So, opponent can take 1, leaving 12 (L). Hmm, that's bad. Alternatively, if I take 1 from 17, leaving 16 (W). So, opponent can take 1, leaving 15 (L). So, regardless of what I do, opponent can force me into L. So, n=17 is L?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think differently. Wait, n=17: can I take 1, leaving 16 (W). Then opponent can take 1, leaving 15 (L). So, opponent can win. Alternatively, if I take 4, leaving 13 (W). Opponent can take 1, leaving 12 (L). So, opponent can win again. So, n=17 is L.\n\nWait, but earlier n=13 is W, so if I take 4, opponent gets 13 (W), which is good for them, but bad for me. So, n=17 is L.\n\nn=18: Take 1, leaving 17 (L). So, W.\n\nn=19: Take 4, leaving 15 (L). So, W.\n\nn=20: Take 1, leaving 19 (W). Take 4, leaving 16 (W). So, both options lead to opponent W. So, n=20 is L.\n\nWait, so the sequence so far is:\n\nn: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n\nW/L: L W L W W L W L W W L W L W W L W L W W L\n\nLooking at this, I can see a pattern that every 5 numbers, the cycle repeats? Let's see.\n\nFrom n=0 to n=5: L, W, L, W, W, L\n\nn=6 to n=10: W, L, W, W, L\n\nn=11 to n=15: W, L, W, W, L\n\nWait, no, that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cycle is every 5 numbers, but the starting point shifts.\n\nWait, let's check from n=0:\n\n0: L\n\n1: W\n\n2: L\n\n3: W\n\n4: W\n\n5: L\n\n6: W\n\n7: L\n\n8: W\n\n9: W\n\n10: L\n\n11: W\n\n12: L\n\n13: W\n\n14: W\n\n15: L\n\n16: W\n\n17: L\n\n18: W\n\n19: W\n\n20: L\n\nSo, the sequence is L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L...\n\nSo, the pattern seems to be L, W, L, W, W, and then repeats. Let me check:\n\nFrom n=0: positions 0-4: L, W, L, W, W\n\nn=5: L\n\nn=6: W (same as n=1)\n\nn=7: L (same as n=2)\n\nn=8: W (same as n=3)\n\nn=9: W (same as n=4)\n\nn=10: L (same as n=5)\n\nSo, it's a cycle of 5, but shifted. Wait, no, because n=5 is L, n=6 is W, which is similar to n=1, so perhaps the cycle is 5.\n\nBut let me think in terms of modulo. Let's see for each n, what is n mod 5.\n\nn=0: 0 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=1:1 \u2192 W\n\nn=2:2 \u2192 L\n\nn=3:3 \u2192 W\n\nn=4:4 \u2192 W\n\nn=5:0 \u2192 L\n\nn=6:1 \u2192 W\n\nn=7:2 \u2192 L\n\nn=8:3 \u2192 W\n\nn=9:4 \u2192 W\n\nn=10:0 \u2192 L\n\nSo, n mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn mod5=1 \u2192 W\n\nn mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn mod5=3 \u2192 W\n\nn mod5=4 \u2192 W\n\nSo, the pattern is: if n mod5 is 0, 2, or 3, then it's L? Wait, no.\n\nWait, no, from n=0 to n=4:\n\nn mod5: 0 \u2192 L\n\n1 \u2192 W\n\n2 \u2192 L\n\n3 \u2192 W\n\n4 \u2192 W\n\nThen n=5 (0 mod5) \u2192 L\n\nn=6 (1 mod5) \u2192 W\n\nn=7 (2 mod5) \u2192 L\n\nn=8 (3 mod5) \u2192 W\n\nn=9 (4 mod5) \u2192 W\n\nSo, the pattern is that when n mod5 is 0, it's L; when it's 1 or 3, it's W; when it's 2 or 4, it's L? Wait, no:\n\nWait, n mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn mod5=1 \u2192 W\n\nn mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn mod5=3 \u2192 W\n\nn mod5=4 \u2192 W\n\nWait, so it's:\n\nn mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn mod5=1 \u2192 W\n\nn mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn mod5=3 \u2192 W\n\nn mod5=4 \u2192 W\n\nSo, for n mod5=0,2,3: Wait no, n mod5=0 is L, n mod5=2 is L, n mod5=3 is W. Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nLooking at the initial sequence:\n\nn=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=5 \u2192 L\n\nn=7 \u2192 L\n\nn=10 \u2192 L\n\nn=12 \u2192 L\n\nn=15 \u2192 L\n\nn=17 \u2192 L\n\nn=20 \u2192 L\n\nSo, the losing positions are n where n mod5=0 or 2.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nn=0 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=2 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=5 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=7 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=10 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=12 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=15 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=17 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=20 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nYes, so the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, but let's check n=3: n=3 mod5=3 \u2192 W\n\nn=4 mod5=4 \u2192 W\n\nn=1 mod5=1 \u2192 W\n\nn=6 mod5=1 \u2192 W\n\nn=8 mod5=3 \u2192 W\n\nn=9 mod5=4 \u2192 W\n\nSo, yes, the losing positions are when n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, for n \u22610 or 2 mod5, the position is losing.\n\nThus, in the game, if n is 0 or 2 mod5, the current player cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.\n\nWait, but wait: in the initial analysis, n=5 is L, which is 0 mod5. n=7 is 2 mod5, which is L. So yes, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, in the game, if the starting number n is a losing position, then the second player (Bob) can win. Because Alice starts first, and if n is a losing position, Bob can always respond to Alice's moves in such a way to bring the game back to a losing position for Alice.\n\nWait, let me think about that. If n is a losing position, then the player whose turn it is cannot win. Since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position, Bob can always win.\n\nSo, the number of losing positions n \u22642024 is the number of n where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, we need to count how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, find the total numbers \u22610 mod5 \u22642024.\n\nThe largest multiple of 5 \u22642024 is 2020 (since 2024 \u00f75=404.8, so 5\u00d7404=2020).\n\nSo, numbers: 5,10,15,...,2020.\n\nNumber of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1= 403 +1=404.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5 \u22642024.\n\nThe sequence is 2,7,12,..., up to the largest number \u22642024.\n\nWhat's the largest number \u22642024 that is \u22612 mod5?\n\n2024 \u00f75=404.8, so 5\u00d7404=2020. 2020+2=2022.\n\nSo, the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nNumber of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1= (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo, total losing positions are 404 (for mod5=0) +405 (for mod5=2)= 809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nNumber of terms \u22610 mod5: from 5 to 2020.\n\nNumber of terms: floor(2024/5)=404 (since 5\u00d7404=2020). So, 404 terms.\n\nSimilarly, for \u22612 mod5: from 2 to 2022.\n\nNumber of terms: let's see, 2 +5(k-1)=2022 \u2192 5(k-1)=2020 \u2192 k-1=404 \u2192 k=405.\n\nSo, 405 terms.\n\nThus, total losing positions: 404 +405=809.\n\nBut wait, n starts from 1. Wait, n=0 is a losing position, but the problem says positive integers n \u22642024. So, n starts at 1. So, n=0 is excluded.\n\nSo, for mod5=0: numbers 5,10,...,2020. So, 404 numbers.\n\nFor mod5=2: numbers 2,7,...,2022. So, 405 numbers.\n\nSo, total losing positions are 404 +405=809.\n\nBut wait, is 2022 \u22642024? Yes.\n\nWait, but let me check 2022: 2022 \u00f75=404.4, so 5\u00d7404=2020, plus 2 is 2022.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, the number of n \u22642024 where Bob can force a win is 809.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because if n is a losing position, then Bob can win. So, the number of such n is 809.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm the initial analysis about the losing positions.\n\nEarlier, I thought that the losing positions are n\u22610 or 2 mod5. Let me check with n=5: yes, L; n=7: yes, L; n=10: yes, L; n=12: yes, L; n=15: yes, L; n=17: yes, L; n=20: yes, L.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of losing positions is 809.\n\nSo, the answer is 809.\n\nBut wait, let me re-examine the initial step where n=0 is considered a losing position. Since the problem states positive integers n, n=0 is not included. So, for mod5=0, numbers start at 5, which is correct. For mod5=2, numbers start at 2, which is included as a positive integer. So, the counts are correct.\n\nThus, the total number is 404 +405=809.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game using the concept of winning (W) and losing (L) positions. A losing position is one where the current player cannot force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Winning and Losing Positions**:\n   - \\( n = 0 \\): L (game ends, no tokens left).\n   - \\( n = 1 \\): W (take 1 token and win).\n   - \\( n = 2 \\): L (taking 1 token leaves 1 for the opponent to win).\n   - \\( n = 3 \\): W (take 1 token, leaving 2, which is L for the opponent).\n   - \\( n = 4 \\): W (take 4 tokens and win).\n   - \\( n = 5 \\): L (taking 1 or 4 tokens leaves the opponent in a winning position).\n   - The pattern repeats every 5 numbers: L, W, L, W, W.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - Positions where \\( n \\equiv 0 \\) or \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\) are losing positions.\n\n### Counting Losing Positions:\n- **Numbers \\( \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\)**:\n  - The sequence is \\( 5, 10, 15, \\ldots, 2020 \\).\n  - Number of terms: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2024}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 404 \\).\n\n- **Numbers \\( \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\)**:\n  - The sequence is \\( 2, 7, 12, \\ldots, 2022 \\).\n  - Number of terms: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2022 - 2}{5} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 405 \\).\n\n### Total Losing Positions:\n- Summing both cases: \\( 404 + 405 = 809 \\).\n\nThus, there are **809** positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) where Bob can guarantee a win.\n\n\\boxed{809}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, let me try to break this down. It sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember something about winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite\u2014no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, the goal here is to find all n where Bob can force a win, which would mean that for those n, Alice is in a losing position. Since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position for the first player, then Bob can win.\n\nLet me think about small values of n to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nStarting with n=1:\n- Alice can take 1 token and win. So, n=1 is a winning position for Alice. Bob can't win here.\n\nn=2:\n- Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take the last one and win. Wait, no\u2014Alice takes 1, leaving 1. Bob can take 1 and win. So, if n=2, Alice can win by taking 1, right? Because after she takes 1, Bob is left with 1 and can take it to win. Wait, no\u2014if Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1 and wins. So actually, n=2 would be a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. Wait, that doesn't make sense because Alice is going first. Wait, let's reevaluate.\n\nWait, when n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Alternatively, can Alice take 4? No, because n=2 is less than 4. So she can only take 1. So she has to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. So in n=2, Alice can't win; Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So for n=2, Bob can win.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory because Alice is forced to take 1, leaving Bob to take the last one. So yes, Bob can win when n=2.\n\nn=3:\n- Alice can take 1, leaving 2 for Bob. From n=2, we just saw that Bob can win. So if Alice takes 1, Bob wins. Alternatively, can Alice take 4? No, because n=3 <4. So she can only take 1. So, n=3 is a winning position for Bob? Wait, no\u2014if Alice takes 1, leaving 2, and Bob can win from 2. So Alice would not want to do that. Wait, wait a minute. No, wait: If Alice is in n=3, she has to take 1, which leads to n=2, which is a winning position for Bob. So n=3 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. Wait, is that right? So n=3 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. So n=3 is a losing position for the first player.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list the positions step by step.\n\nLet me define P(n) as true if the current player can force a win from n tokens.\n\nBase cases:\n- P(0): If there are 0 tokens, the game is over. So this is a losing position because the player can't make a move. But wait, in the problem, the player who removes the last token wins. So if n=0, the previous player has already taken the last token. So if the current player is faced with n=0, they lose. So P(0) is false.\n\nNow, for n=1:\n- The current player can take 1 and win. So P(1)=true.\n\nn=2:\n- Current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. So the current player can't win if they take 1. Alternatively, can they take 4? No, because 4>2. So the only move is to take 1, leading to n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So P(2)=false. Wait, so the current player can't force a win. So n=2 is a losing position.\n\nn=3:\n- Current player can take 1, leaving n=2, which is a losing position for the opponent. So P(3)=true because the current player can force the opponent into a losing position.\n\nWait, this contradicts what I thought earlier. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, if n=2 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is, then when n=3, the current player can take 1, leaving n=2 for the opponent, which is a losing position. So the opponent can't win from n=2. So P(3)=true.\n\nn=4:\n- Current player can take 4 tokens and win. So P(4)=true.\n\nn=5:\n- Current player can take 1, leaving n=4, which is a winning position for the opponent. Or take 4, leaving n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. Wait, so both options leave the opponent in a winning position. So P(5)=false.\n\nn=6:\n- Current player can take 1, leaving n=5, which is a losing position for the opponent. So P(6)=true.\n\nn=7:\n- Take 1, leaving n=6 (winning for opponent). Take 4, leaving n=3 (winning for opponent). So both moves leave opponent in a winning position. So P(7)=false.\n\nn=8:\n- Take 1, leaving n=7 (losing for opponent). So P(8)=true.\n\nn=9:\n- Take 1, leaving n=8 (winning for opponent). Take 4, leaving n=5 (losing for opponent). So if the current player takes 4, leaving n=5, which is a losing position for the opponent. So P(9)=true.\n\nWait, because taking 4 from 9 leaves 5, which is a losing position for the opponent. So P(9)=true.\n\nn=10:\n- Take 1, leaving n=9 (winning for opponent). Take 4, leaving n=6 (winning for opponent). So both options leave the opponent in a winning position. So P(10)=false.\n\nHmm, so let's list these out:\n\nn | P(n)\n---|---\n0 | F\n1 | T\n2 | F\n3 | T\n4 | T\n5 | F\n6 | T\n7 | F\n8 | T\n9 | T\n10| F\n\nWait, I see a pattern emerging. Let me try to see if there's a cycle or a repeating pattern.\n\nLooking at the results so far:\n\nn | P(n)\n0 | F\n1 | T\n2 | F\n3 | T\n4 | T\n5 | F\n6 | T\n7 | F\n8 | T\n9 | T\n10| F\n11| ?\n12| ?\n\nLet me compute a few more to see.\n\nn=11:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=10 (P= F) \u2192 opponent loses. So current player can take 1, leaving n=10, which is a losing position for the opponent. So P(11)=true.\n\nn=12:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=11 (P=T), Take 4 \u2192 n=8 (P=T). Both options leave opponent in a winning position. So P(12)=false.\n\nn=13:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=12 (P=F). So current player can take 1, leaving opponent at n=12, which is a losing position. So P(13)=true.\n\nn=14:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=13 (T), Take 4 \u2192 n=10 (F). So if current player takes 4, opponent is at n=10 (losing). So P(14)=true.\n\nn=15:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=14 (T), Take 4 \u2192 n=11 (T). Both options leave opponent in a winning position. So P(15)=false.\n\nn=16:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=15 (F). So P(16)=true.\n\nn=17:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=16 (T), Take 4 \u2192 n=13 (T). Both options leave opponent in a winning position. So P(17)=false.\n\nn=18:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=17 (F). So P(18)=true.\n\nn=19:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=18 (T), Take 4 \u2192 n=15 (F). So taking 4 leaves opponent at n=15 (losing). So P(19)=true.\n\nn=20:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=19 (T), Take 4 \u2192 n=16 (T). Both options leave opponent in a winning position. So P(20)=false.\n\nHmm, now let's list n and P(n) up to 20:\n\nn | P(n)\n0 | F\n1 | T\n2 | F\n3 | T\n4 | T\n5 | F\n6 | T\n7 | F\n8 | T\n9 | T\n10| F\n11| T\n12| F\n13| T\n14| T\n15| F\n16| T\n17| F\n18| T\n19| T\n20| F\n\nLooking at this, I can see a pattern that repeats every 5 numbers. Let me check:\n\nLooking at n=0 to n=4:\n\nn | P(n)\n0 | F\n1 | T\n2 | F\n3 | T\n4 | T\n\nn=5 to n=9:\n\n5 | F\n6 | T\n7 | F\n8 | T\n9 | T\n\nn=10 to n=14:\n\n10| F\n11| T\n12| F\n13| T\n14| T\n\nn=15 to n=19:\n\n15| F\n16| T\n17| F\n18| T\n19| T\n\nn=20: F (which is the start of the next cycle)\n\nSo the pattern seems to repeat every 5 numbers. The losing positions (where P(n)=F) are at n=0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... which seems like they are increasing by 3, then 3, then 2, then 3, etc. Wait, but looking at the positions where P(n)=F, starting from n=0:\n\n0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nThe differences between consecutive terms are 2,3,2,3,2,3,2,...\n\nSo the losing positions are at n \u2261 0 mod 5, n \u2261 2 mod 5, and n \u2261 3 mod 5? Wait no, looking at n=0: 0 mod 5 is 0.\n\nn=2: 2 mod 5.\n\nn=5: 0 mod 5.\n\nn=7: 2 mod 5.\n\nn=10: 0 mod 5.\n\nn=12: 2 mod 5.\n\nn=15: 0 mod 5.\n\nn=17: 2 mod 5.\n\nn=20: 0 mod 5.\n\nWait, so the losing positions are at n \u2261 0 mod 5 and n \u2261 2 mod 5.\n\nWait, but wait: n=5 is 0 mod 5, n=7 is 2 mod 5, n=10 is 0 mod 5, etc. So the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nBut wait, let's see:\n\nLooking at the P(n) table, for n=0: F, 1: T, 2:F, 3:T,4:T,5:F,6:T,7:F,8:T,9:T,10:F,11:T,12:F,13:T,14:T,15:F,16:T,17:F,18:T,19:T,20:F.\n\nSo the losing positions (F) are at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... which correspond to n \u22610 or 2 mod5. Because 0 mod5 is 0,5,10,15,20,... and 2 mod5 is 2,7,12,17,22,...\n\nSo, in each block of 5 numbers, the losing positions are at 0 and 2 mod5. So in each cycle of 5, there are 2 losing positions.\n\nSo for each 5 numbers, 2 are losing positions. So the number of losing positions \u22642024 is (number of complete cycles) * 2 plus any remaining in the incomplete cycle.\n\nWait, but let me confirm whether this pattern holds beyond n=20. Let me check n=21.\n\nn=21: Take 1 \u2192 n=20 (P=F), so P(21)=true.\n\nn=22: Take 1 \u2192 n=21 (T), Take 4 \u2192 n=18 (T). So both moves leave opponent in winning position. So P(22)=false.\n\nn=23: Take 1 \u2192 n=22 (F). So P(23)=true.\n\nn=24: Take 1 \u2192 n=23 (T), Take4 \u2192 n=20 (F). So P(24)=true.\n\nn=25: Take 1 \u2192 n=24 (T), Take4 \u2192 n=21 (T). So both options leave opponent in winning position. So P(25)=false.\n\nSo n=25 is a losing position, which is 0 mod5. Yep, that fits. n=25 is 0 mod5.\n\nn=26: Take 1 \u2192 n=25 (F). So P(26)=true.\n\nn=27: Take 1 \u2192 n=26 (T), Take4 \u2192 n=23 (T). So both options leave opponent in winning position. So P(27)=false.\n\nn=28: Take 1 \u2192 n=27 (F). So P(28)=true.\n\nn=29: Take1 \u2192 n=28 (T), Take4 \u2192 n=25 (F). So P(29)=true.\n\nn=30: Take1 \u2192 n=29 (T), Take4 \u2192n=26 (T). So both options leave opponent in winning position. So P(30)=false.\n\nSo n=30 is a losing position, which is 0 mod5. Yep, the pattern holds.\n\nSo the losing positions are n \u22610 mod5 and n\u22612 mod5.\n\nThus, for each n, if n \u22610 or 2 mod5, then P(n)=F (losing position for the current player). So if n is a losing position, then the current player cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.\n\nIn our problem, Alice goes first. So for Bob to have a winning strategy, Alice must be in a losing position. So we're looking for n where P(n)=F, which are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo the number of such n \u22642024 is the count of numbers \u22642024 that are \u22610 mod5 or \u22612 mod5.\n\nNow, let's compute how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5 and how many are \u22612 mod5.\n\nFirst, numbers \u22610 mod5: These are 5,10,15,..., up to the largest multiple of 5 \u22642024.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5: These are 2,7,12,..., up to the largest number \u22642024 that is \u22612 mod5.\n\nLet me calculate the count for each.\n\nFor numbers \u22610 mod5:\n\nThe smallest is 5, the largest is 2020 (since 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so 404*5=2020).\n\nNumber of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1= 403 +1=404.\n\nWait, wait: Let me check that formula again. The number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last - first)/difference) +1.\n\nSo for 0 mod5:\n\nFirst term is 5, last term is 2020.\n\nNumber of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.\n\nSimilarly, for numbers \u22612 mod5:\n\nThe smallest is 2, the next is7,12,..., up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nWhat's the largest number \u22642024 that is \u22612 mod5?\n\n2024 divided by5 is 404.8, so 404*5=2020. 2020 +2=2022, which is \u22642024.\n\nSo last term is 2022.\n\nNumber of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1= (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check: 2022 -2 =2020. 2020/5=404. So 404 +1=405 terms.\n\nWait, so numbers \u22610 mod5: 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5: 405 numbers.\n\nTotal losing positions: 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me think about the number of terms in each sequence.\n\nFor \u22610 mod5:\n\nThe first term is 5, last term 2020.\n\nNumber of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404. Correct.\n\nFor \u22612 mod5:\n\nFirst term 2, last term 2022.\n\nNumber of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405. Correct.\n\nSo total numbers where P(n)=F are 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but let me check for n=0. In the problem statement, n is a positive integer, so n starts at 1. So for \u22610 mod5, the first term is 5, which is correct. And for \u22612 mod5, the first term is 2, which is allowed since n is positive.\n\nSo total numbers \u22642024 where n is \u22610 or 2 mod5 is 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Wait, n=0 is excluded because n is positive. So our counts are correct.\n\nWait, but let me check for n=2024. Is 2024 included?\n\nYes, because 2024 is \u22614 mod5. So it's not a losing position, so it's not counted.\n\nWait, but let me think: 2024 divided by5 is 404*5=2020, so 2024=2020+4. So 2024 mod5=4.\n\nSo the last term in \u22612 mod5 is 2022, which is 2020+2=2022, which is 2022 mod5=2.\n\nSo our counts are correct.\n\nSo the total number of losing positions where Bob can force a win is 809.\n\nWait, but wait: Let me think about n=0 again. Since n starts at 1, n=0 isn't considered. So in our counts for \u22610 mod5, the first term is 5, which is correct. So for 0 mod5, 404 terms from 5 to 2020.\n\nAnd for 2 mod5, 405 terms from 2 to 2022.\n\nSo total is 809.\n\nSo the answer should be 809.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the losing positions are indeed n\u22610 or 2 mod5. Because in the initial analysis, I saw that the losing positions were at 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... which are exactly 0 and 2 mod5. So the pattern holds.\n\nYes, so the conclusion is that the number of positive integers n \u22642024 where Bob can force a win is 809.\n",

This gives $\\frac{2022 - 2}{5} + 1 = 405$ terms.\n\nAdding these, the total number of losing positions is $404 + 405 = 809$.\n\nThus, there are $\\boxed{809}$ positive integers $n \\leq 2024$ where Bob can guarantee a win.",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, let me try to break this down. It sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember something about winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite\u2014no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, the goal here is to find all n where Bob can force a win, which would mean that for those n, Alice is in a losing position. Since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position for the first player, then Bob can win.\n\nLet me think about small values of n to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nStarting with n=1:\n- Alice can take 1 token and win. So, n=1 is a winning position for Alice. Bob can't win here.\n\nn=2:\n- Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take the last one and win. Wait, no\u2014Alice takes 1, leaving 1. Bob can take 1 and win. So, if n=2, Alice can win by taking 1, right? Because after she takes 1, Bob is left with 1 and can take it to win. Wait, no\u2014if Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1 and wins. So actually, n=2 would be a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. Wait, that doesn't make sense because Alice is going first. Wait, let's reevaluate.\n\nWait, when n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Alternatively, can Alice take 4? No, because n=2 is less than 4. So she can only take 1. So she has to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. So in n=2, Alice can't win; Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So for n=2, Bob can win.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory because Alice is forced to take 1, leaving Bob to take the last one. So yes, Bob can win when n=2.\n\nn=3:\n- Alice can take 1, leaving 2 for Bob. From n=2, we just saw that Bob can win. So if Alice takes 1, Bob wins. Alternatively, can Alice take 4? No, because n=3 <4. So she can only take 1. So, n=3 is a winning position for Bob? Wait, no\u2014if Alice takes 1, leaving 2, and Bob can win from 2. So Alice would not want to do that. Wait, wait a minute. No, wait: If Alice is in n=3, she has to take 1, which leads to n=2, which is a winning position for Bob. So n=3 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. Wait, is that right? So n=3 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. So n=3 is a losing position for the first player.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list the positions step by step.\n\nLet me define P(n) as true if the current player can force a win from n tokens.\n\nBase cases:\n- P(0): If there are 0 tokens, the game is over. So this is a losing position because the player can't make a move. But wait, in the problem, the player who removes the last token wins. So if n=0, the previous player has already taken the last token. So if the current player is faced with n=0, they lose. So P(0) is false.\n\nNow, for n=1:\n- The current player can take 1 and win. So P(1)=true.\n\nn=2:\n- Current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. So the current player can't win if they take 1. Alternatively, can they take 4? No, because 4>2. So the only move is to take 1, leading to n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So P(2)=false. Wait, so the current player can't force a win. So n=2 is a losing position.\n\nn=3:\n- Current player can take 1, leaving n=2, which is a losing position for the opponent. So P(3)=true because the current player can force the opponent into a losing position.\n\nWait, this contradicts what I thought earlier. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, if n=2 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is, then when n=3, the current player can take 1, leaving n=2 for the opponent, which is a losing position. So the opponent can't win from n=2. So P(3)=true.\n\nn=4:\n- Current player can take 4 tokens and win. So P(4)=true.\n\nn=5:\n- Current player can take 1, leaving n=4, which is a winning position for the opponent. Or take 4, leaving n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. Wait, so both options leave the opponent in a winning position. So P(5)=false.\n\nn=6:\n- Current player can take 1, leaving n=5, which is a losing position for the opponent. So P(6)=true.\n\nn=7:\n- Take 1, leaving n=6 (winning for opponent). Take 4, leaving n=3 (winning for opponent). So both moves leave opponent in a winning position. So P(7)=false.\n\nn=8:\n- Take 1, leaving n=7 (losing for opponent). So P(8)=true.\n\nn=9:\n- Take 1, leaving n=8 (winning for opponent). Take 4, leaving n=5 (losing for opponent). So if the current player takes 4, leaving n=5, which is a losing position for the opponent. So P(9)=true.\n\nWait, because taking 4 from 9 leaves 5, which is a losing position for the opponent. So P(9)=true.\n\nn=10:\n- Take 1, leaving n=9 (winning for opponent). Take 4, leaving n=6 (winning for opponent). So both options leave the opponent in a winning position. So P(10)=false.\n\nHmm, so let's list these out:\n\nn | P(n)\n---|---\n0 | F\n1 | T\n2 | F\n3 | T\n4 | T\n5 | F\n6 | T\n7 | F\n8 | T\n9 | T\n10| F\n\nWait, I see a pattern emerging. Let me try to see if there's a cycle or a repeating pattern.\n\nLooking at the results so far:\n\nn | P(n)\n0 | F\n1 | T\n2 | F\n3 | T\n4 | T\n5 | F\n6 | T\n7 | F\n8 | T\n9 | T\n10| F\n11| ?\n12| ?\n\nLet me compute a few more to see.\n\nn=11:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=10 (P= F) \u2192 opponent loses. So current player can take 1, leaving n=10, which is a losing position for the opponent. So P(11)=true.\n\nn=12:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=11 (P=T), Take 4 \u2192 n=8 (P=T). Both options leave opponent in a winning position. So P(12)=false.\n\nn=13:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=12 (P=F). So current player can take 1, leaving opponent at n=12, which is a losing position. So P(13)=true.\n\nn=14:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=13 (T), Take 4 \u2192 n=10 (F). So if current player takes 4, opponent is at n=10 (losing). So P(14)=true.\n\nn=15:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=14 (T), Take 4 \u2192 n=11 (T). Both options leave opponent in a winning position. So P(15)=false.\n\nn=16:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=15 (F). So P(16)=true.\n\nn=17:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=16 (T), Take 4 \u2192 n=13 (T). Both options leave opponent in a winning position. So P(17)=false.\n\nn=18:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=17 (F). So P(18)=true.\n\nn=19:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=18 (T), Take 4 \u2192 n=15 (F). So taking 4 leaves opponent at n=15 (losing). So P(19)=true.\n\nn=20:\n- Take 1 \u2192 n=19 (T), Take 4 \u2192 n=16 (T). Both options leave opponent in a winning position. So P(20)=false.\n\nHmm, now let's list n and P(n) up to 20:\n\nn | P(n)\n0 | F\n1 | T\n2 | F\n3 | T\n4 | T\n5 | F\n6 | T\n7 | F\n8 | T\n9 | T\n10| F\n11| T\n12| F\n13| T\n14| T\n15| F\n16| T\n17| F\n18| T\n19| T\n20| F\n\nLooking at this, I can see a pattern that repeats every 5 numbers. Let me check:\n\nLooking at n=0 to n=4:\n\nn | P(n)\n0 | F\n1 | T\n2 | F\n3 | T\n4 | T\n\nn=5 to n=9:\n\n5 | F\n6 | T\n7 | F\n8 | T\n9 | T\n\nn=10 to n=14:\n\n10| F\n11| T\n12| F\n13| T\n14| T\n\nn=15 to n=19:\n\n15| F\n16| T\n17| F\n18| T\n19| T\n\nn=20: F (which is the start of the next cycle)\n\nSo the pattern seems to repeat every 5 numbers. The losing positions (where P(n)=F) are at n=0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... which seems like they are increasing by 3, then 3, then 2, then 3, etc. Wait, but looking at the positions where P(n)=F, starting from n=0:\n\n0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nThe differences between consecutive terms are 2,3,2,3,2,3,2,...\n\nSo the losing positions are at n \u2261 0 mod 5, n \u2261 2 mod 5, and n \u2261 3 mod 5? Wait no, looking at n=0: 0 mod 5 is 0.\n\nn=2: 2 mod 5.\n\nn=5: 0 mod 5.\n\nn=7: 2 mod 5.\n\nn=10: 0 mod 5.\n\nn=12: 2 mod 5.\n\nn=15: 0 mod 5.\n\nn=17: 2 mod 5.\n\nn=20: 0 mod 5.\n\nWait, so the losing positions are at n \u2261 0 mod 5 and n \u2261 2 mod 5.\n\nWait, but wait: n=5 is 0 mod 5, n=7 is 2 mod 5, n=10 is 0 mod 5, etc. So the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nBut wait, let's see:\n\nLooking at the P(n) table, for n=0: F, 1: T, 2:F, 3:T,4:T,5:F,6:T,7:F,8:T,9:T,10:F,11:T,12:F,13:T,14:T,15:F,16:T,17:F,18:T,19:T,20:F.\n\nSo the losing positions (F) are at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... which correspond to n \u22610 or 2 mod5. Because 0 mod5 is 0,5,10,15,20,... and 2 mod5 is 2,7,12,17,22,...\n\nSo, in each block of 5 numbers, the losing positions are at 0 and 2 mod5. So in each cycle of 5, there are 2 losing positions.\n\nSo for each 5 numbers, 2 are losing positions. So the number of losing positions \u22642024 is (number of complete cycles) * 2 plus any remaining in the incomplete cycle.\n\nWait, but let me confirm whether this pattern holds beyond n=20. Let me check n=21.\n\nn=21: Take 1 \u2192 n=20 (P=F), so P(21)=true.\n\nn=22: Take 1 \u2192 n=21 (T), Take 4 \u2192 n=18 (T). So both moves leave opponent in winning position. So P(22)=false.\n\nn=23: Take 1 \u2192 n=22 (F). So P(23)=true.\n\nn=24: Take 1 \u2192 n=23 (T), Take4 \u2192 n=20 (F). So P(24)=true.\n\nn=25: Take 1 \u2192 n=24 (T), Take4 \u2192 n=21 (T). So both options leave opponent in winning position. So P(25)=false.\n\nSo n=25 is a losing position, which is 0 mod5. Yep, that fits. n=25 is 0 mod5.\n\nn=26: Take 1 \u2192 n=25 (F). So P(26)=true.\n\nn=27: Take 1 \u2192 n=26 (T), Take4 \u2192 n=23 (T). So both options leave opponent in winning position. So P(27)=false.\n\nn=28: Take 1 \u2192 n=27 (F). So P(28)=true.\n\nn=29: Take1 \u2192 n=28 (T), Take4 \u2192 n=25 (F). So P(29)=true.\n\nn=30: Take1 \u2192 n=29 (T), Take4 \u2192n=26 (T). So both options leave opponent in winning position. So P(30)=false.\n\nSo n=30 is a losing position, which is 0 mod5. Yep, the pattern holds.\n\nSo the losing positions are n \u22610 mod5 and n\u22612 mod5.\n\nThus, for each n, if n \u22610 or 2 mod5, then P(n)=F (losing position for the current player). So if n is a losing position, then the current player cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.\n\nIn our problem, Alice goes first. So for Bob to have a winning strategy, Alice must be in a losing position. So we're looking for n where P(n)=F, which are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo the number of such n \u22642024 is the count of numbers \u22642024 that are \u22610 mod5 or \u22612 mod5.\n\nNow, let's compute how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5 and how many are \u22612 mod5.\n\nFirst, numbers \u22610 mod5: These are 5,10,15,..., up to the largest multiple of 5 \u22642024.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5: These are 2,7,12,..., up to the largest number \u22642024 that is \u22612 mod5.\n\nLet me calculate the count for each.\n\nFor numbers \u22610 mod5:\n\nThe smallest is 5, the largest is 2020 (since 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so 404*5=2020).\n\nNumber of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1= 403 +1=404.\n\nWait, wait: Let me check that formula again. The number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last - first)/difference) +1.\n\nSo for 0 mod5:\n\nFirst term is 5, last term is 2020.\n\nNumber of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.\n\nSimilarly, for numbers \u22612 mod5:\n\nThe smallest is 2, the next is7,12,..., up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nWhat's the largest number \u22642024 that is \u22612 mod5?\n\n2024 divided by5 is 404.8, so 404*5=2020. 2020 +2=2022, which is \u22642024.\n\nSo last term is 2022.\n\nNumber of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1= (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check: 2022 -2 =2020. 2020/5=404. So 404 +1=405 terms.\n\nWait, so numbers \u22610 mod5: 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5: 405 numbers.\n\nTotal losing positions: 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me think about the number of terms in each sequence.\n\nFor \u22610 mod5:\n\nThe first term is 5, last term 2020.\n\nNumber of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404. Correct.\n\nFor \u22612 mod5:\n\nFirst term 2, last term 2022.\n\nNumber of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405. Correct.\n\nSo total numbers where P(n)=F are 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but let me check for n=0. In the problem statement, n is a positive integer, so n starts at 1. So for \u22610 mod5, the first term is 5, which is correct. And for \u22612 mod5, the first term is 2, which is allowed since n is positive.\n\nSo total numbers \u22642024 where n is \u22610 or 2 mod5 is 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Wait, n=0 is excluded because n is positive. So our counts are correct.\n\nWait, but let me check for n=2024. Is 2024 included?\n\nYes, because 2024 is \u22614 mod5. So it's not a losing position, so it's not counted.\n\nWait, but let me think: 2024 divided by5 is 404*5=2020, so 2024=2020+4. So 2024 mod5=4.\n\nSo the last term in \u22612 mod5 is 2022, which is 2020+2=2022, which is 2022 mod5=2.\n\nSo our counts are correct.\n\nSo the total number of losing positions where Bob can force a win is 809.\n\nWait, but wait: Let me think about n=0 again. Since n starts at 1, n=0 isn't considered. So in our counts for \u22610 mod5, the first term is 5, which is correct. So for 0 mod5, 404 terms from 5 to 2020.\n\nAnd for 2 mod5, 405 terms from 2 to 2022.\n\nSo total is 809.\n\nSo the answer should be 809.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the losing positions are indeed n\u22610 or 2 mod5. Because in the initial analysis, I saw that the losing positions were at 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... which are exactly 0 and 2 mod5. So the pattern holds.\n\nYes, so the conclusion is that the number of positive integers n \u22642024 where Bob can force a win is 809.\n\n\nAlice and Bob play a game with a stack of $n$ tokens, taking turns to remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The player who removes the last token wins. To determine the number of positive integers $n \\leq 2024$ for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game using combinatorial game theory.\n\nWe define $P(n)$ as true if the current player can force a win from $n$ tokens. Through analysis, we identify that losing positions (where $P(n) = \\text{false}$) occur at $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ and $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$. These positions are losing for the current player, meaning Bob can win if Alice starts at such $n$.\n\nTo count the number of such $n$ up to 2024:\n- Numbers $\\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$: The sequence is 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020. This gives $\\frac{2020 - 5}{5} + 1 = 404$ terms.\n- Numbers $\\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$: The sequence is 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022. This gives $\\frac{2022 - 2}{5} + 1 = 405$ terms.\n\nAdding these, the total number of losing positions is $404 + 405 = 809$.\n\nThus, there are $\\boxed{809}$ positive integers $n \\leq 2024$ where Bob can guarantee a win.",
