      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses ABCD on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. The diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they are in a square. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm confusing with a kite. Let me think again. No, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me clarify: In a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. So they are perpendicular. Okay, yes, that's correct. So in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n\nSo, given that ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So the diagonals pass through the origin, which is their midpoint.\n\nSo, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, each vertex is symmetric with respect to the origin. So, for example, if point A is (x, y), then point C, which is the opposite vertex, would be (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D would be symmetric in the same way. So, the coordinates are such that A = (x, y), B = (p, q), C = (-x, -y), D = (-p, -q).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think in terms of vectors. Let's denote vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, OA and OC are opposite vectors, as are OB and OD.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other. So, the midpoint of AC is the origin, and the midpoint of BD is the origin. So, points A and C are symmetric about the origin, as are points B and D. So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y); same with B and D.\n\nSo, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, diagonal AC has length from A to C, which is from (x, y) to (-x, -y), so the distance is sqrt[(2x)^2 + (2y)^2] = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Similarly, diagonal BD has length 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes should be -1. Wait, but since we're dealing with vectors, the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular. Vector AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y), but wait, AC is from (x, y) to (-x, -y), so the vector AC is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, vector BD is from B to D, which is (-2p, -2q). Wait, but if the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, vector AC \u00b7 vector BD = (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 4xp + 4yq = 0. So, 4xp + 4yq = 0 => xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, that's one condition.\n\nAnother thing is that all sides are equal. So, the length AB equals BC, etc. Let's compute AB and BC.\n\nPoint A is (x, y), point B is (p, q). The distance AB is sqrt[(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2].\n\nPoint B is (p, q), point C is (-x, -y). The distance BC is sqrt[(-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2].\n\nSince AB = BC, their squares should be equal.\n\nSo, (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2.\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = p\u00b2 - 2xp + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2yq + y\u00b2.\n\nRight side: (-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2 = (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2 = x\u00b2 + 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yq + q\u00b2.\n\nSet them equal:\n\np\u00b2 - 2xp + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2yq + y\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yq + q\u00b2.\n\nSimplify both sides by subtracting x\u00b2 + p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + y\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n-2xp -2yq = 2xp + 2yq.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-2xp -2yq - 2xp -2yq = 0 => -4xp -4yq = 0 => -4(xp + yq) = 0 => xp + yq = 0.\n\nWait, but earlier we had from the perpendicular diagonals that xp + yq = 0. So, this condition is the same as the diagonals being perpendicular. So, in this case, the condition that AB = BC gives the same equation as the diagonals being perpendicular.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, perhaps in a rhombus on a hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin, the condition that AB = BC is automatically satisfied if the diagonals are perpendicular? Or maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, but in general, for a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so maybe in this case, the condition is automatically satisfied. So, perhaps I only need to use the fact that points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, and that the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nSo, let me rephrase the problem: Find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, and the answer is the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, essentially, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is the infimum, and the answer is the supremum of all such numbers less than BD\u00b2. Wait, actually, the problem says the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily small, then the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would be the infimum.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if BD\u00b2 can get as small as possible, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would be negative infinity, which doesn't make sense. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, for all rhombuses, BD\u00b2 is greater than some number, and we need the greatest such number. So, it's like the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombuses, but if the infimum is attainable, then that's the number. If not, then it's just the infimum.\n\nWait, but hyperbola is unbounded, so perhaps BD\u00b2 can be made as small as possible, approaching zero, but never actually reaching zero because the points are on the hyperbola. So, the infimum would be zero. But that can't be, because the question is asking for a number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, so the greatest such number would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is zero. But that seems trivial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, it's a hyperbola opening along the x-axis. So, points on this hyperbola have |x| >= sqrt(20), because x\u00b2/20 >=1. So, the x-coordinate cannot be less than sqrt(20) in magnitude. So, the points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, so their x-coordinates must satisfy |x| >= sqrt(20) \u2248 4.472.\n\nSo, the points can't be too close to the origin. So, perhaps BD\u00b2 cannot be too small.\n\nWait, because if points are on the hyperbola, their coordinates are constrained.\n\nWait, let me try to model this.\n\nLet me parameterize points A and B on the hyperbola.\n\nSince the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, perhaps we can use hyperbola parametrization.\n\nFor hyperbola, a standard parametrization is x = a sec\u03b8, y = b tan\u03b8, where a\u00b2 = 20, b\u00b2=24.\n\nAlternatively, we can use x = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, y = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions: x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t.\n\nLet me try that. Let me denote point A as (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t). Then, point C is (-sqrt(20) cosh t, -sqrt(24) sinh t).\n\nSimilarly, point B can be another point on the hyperbola, say (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s), and point D is (-sqrt(20) cosh s, -sqrt(24) sinh s).\n\nWait, but in this case, the diagonals AC and BD are the lines connecting A to C and B to D, respectively.\n\nBut wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular.\n\nVector AC is from A to C: (-2 sqrt(20) cosh t, -2 sqrt(24) sinh t).\n\nVector BD is from B to D: (-2 sqrt(20) cosh s, -2 sqrt(24) sinh s).\n\nTheir dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, (-2 sqrt(20) cosh t)(-2 sqrt(20) cosh s) + (-2 sqrt(24) sinh t)(-2 sqrt(24) sinh s) = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n4 * 20 * cosh t cosh s + 4 * 24 * sinh t sinh s = 0.\n\nWhich is 80 cosh t cosh s + 96 sinh t sinh s = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 16: 5 cosh t cosh s + 6 sinh t sinh s = 0.\n\nHmm, that's one equation.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think of another approach.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, and the diagonals are AC and BD.\n\nThe diagonals intersect at the origin, so points A and C are (-x, -y) and (x, y), as are points B and D.\n\nSo, the coordinates are A = (x1, y1), C = (-x1, -y1), B = (x2, y2), D = (-x2, -y2).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nLet's compute AB\u00b2 and BC\u00b2.\n\nAB\u00b2 = (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2.\n\nBC\u00b2 = (-x1 - x2)^2 + (-y1 - y2)^2.\n\nSet AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2:\n\n(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 = (-x1 - x2)^2 + (-y1 - y2)^2.\n\nExpand both sides:\n\nLeft side: (x2\u00b2 - 2x1x2 + x1\u00b2) + (y2\u00b2 - 2y1y2 + y1\u00b2).\n\nRight side: (x1\u00b2 + 2x1x2 + x2\u00b2) + (y1\u00b2 + 2y1y2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nSet equal:\n\nx2\u00b2 - 2x1x2 + x1\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 - 2y1y2 + y1\u00b2 = x1\u00b2 + 2x1x2 + x2\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 + 2y1y2 + y2\u00b2.\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nCancel x2\u00b2, x1\u00b2, y2\u00b2, y1\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n-2x1x2 -2y1y2 = 2x1x2 + 2y1y2.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-2x1x2 -2y1y2 -2x1x2 -2y1y2 = 0 => -4x1x2 -4y1y2 = 0 => x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nSo, x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nBut earlier, from the diagonals being perpendicular, we had x1x2 + y1y2 = 0 as well. So, same condition. So, this is consistent.\n\nSo, the condition for the rhombus is that x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nSo, points A and B must satisfy x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nMoreover, points A and B lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 = 1, and x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, now, we have these constraints:\n\n1. x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 =1,\n\n2. x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 =1,\n\n3. x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2. BD is the diagonal connecting points B and D, but D is (-x2, -y2). So, BD is from (x2, y2) to (-x2, -y2). So, the length of BD is sqrt[(-x2 -x2)^2 + (-y2 - y2)^2] = sqrt[(-2x2)^2 + (-2y2)^2] = sqrt[4x2\u00b2 + 4y2\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, AC\u00b2 = 4(x1\u00b2 + y1\u00b2).\n\nSo, we need to find the minimal possible value of BD\u00b2, which is 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2), given the constraints.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all such rhombuses, and then take the greatest number less than that. But if the infimum is achievable, then that's the number. Otherwise, it's the infimum.\n\nSo, perhaps we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of a single variable and find its minimum.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe have points A = (x1, y1), B = (x2, y2) on the hyperbola, satisfying x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parameterize points A and B on the hyperbola such that their coordinates satisfy this condition.\n\nLet me consider parametrizing points A and B.\n\nSince the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, I can use the parametrization x = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, y = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8.\n\nSo, let me denote point A as (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8). Then, point B can be represented as (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6).\n\nThen, the condition x1x2 + y1y2 = 0 becomes:\n\nsqrt(20) sec\u03b8 * sqrt(20) sec\u03c6 + sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 * sqrt(24) tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nSo, 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 = -24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n20/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) = -24 (sin\u03b8 / cos\u03b8)(sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6).\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6:\n\n20 = -24 (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6).\n\nSo, 20 = -24 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 = -6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6.\n\nSo,\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2, which is 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2) = 4*(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nWait, let me compute x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2:\n\nx2\u00b2 = 20 sec\u00b2\u03c6,\n\ny2\u00b2 = 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6,\n\nso x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 = 20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nExpress this in terms of sin\u03c6 and cos\u03c6:\n\nsec\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6,\n\nso x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 = 20(1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6 = 20 + 44 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut tan\u00b2\u03c6 = (sec\u00b2\u03c6 - 1), so:\n\nx2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 = 20 + 44 (sec\u00b2\u03c6 - 1) = 20 + 44 sec\u00b2\u03c6 - 44 = 44 sec\u00b2\u03c6 -24.\n\nWait, that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6.\n\nWait, from earlier, we have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut I need to relate this to BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8 and \u03c6, then use the condition sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6 to find its minimal value.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4*(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6) = 80 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 96 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nExpress tan\u00b2\u03c6 as sec\u00b2\u03c6 -1:\n\n= 80 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 96 (sec\u00b2\u03c6 -1) = 80 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 96 sec\u00b2\u03c6 -96 = 176 sec\u00b2\u03c6 -96.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 176 sec\u00b2\u03c6 -96.\n\nHmm, okay, so we have BD\u00b2 expressed in terms of sec\u00b2\u03c6. But we also have the condition sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWait, but how do \u03b8 and \u03c6 relate? Because points A and B are independent, except for the condition x1x2 + y1y2 =0.\n\nWait, but in our parametrization, we fixed point A as (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8), and point B as (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6). So, the condition x1x2 + y1y2 =0 gives us 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0, which we transformed into sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, we have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut we need to express BD\u00b2 in terms of this condition.\n\nWait, BD\u00b2 is 176 sec\u00b2\u03c6 -96. So, if we can express sec\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, which is -5/6, then maybe we can find BD\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express sec\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03c6.\n\nWe know that sec\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6, but not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, perhaps we can find an expression for cos\u03c6.\n\nWait, from sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut this relates \u03b8 and \u03c6. So, maybe we can write sin\u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03c6).\n\nBut we also know that sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1.\n\nWait, but this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that for a given \u03c6, \u03b8 is determined such that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut then, is there a way to find the minimal BD\u00b2?\n\nWait, perhaps we can express BD\u00b2 as a function of \u03c6, then find its minimum.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 176 sec\u00b2\u03c6 -96.\n\nBut we also have the condition sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, which relates \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nBut we need to ensure that point A is on the hyperbola, so \u03b8 can be any real number except where cos\u03b8 =0, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that for a given \u03c6, \u03b8 is such that sin\u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03c6).\n\nBut \u03b8 must satisfy |sin\u03b8| <=1, so |(-5)/(6 sin\u03c6)| <=1.\n\nWhich implies |5/(6 sin\u03c6)| <=1 => |sin\u03c6| >=5/6.\n\nSo, |sin\u03c6| >=5/6.\n\nTherefore, sin\u03c6 >=5/6 or sin\u03c6 <=-5/6.\n\nTherefore, the angles \u03c6 must lie in regions where |sin\u03c6| >=5/6.\n\nWhich means \u03c6 is in [arcsin(5/6), \u03c0 - arcsin(5/6)] or [\u03c0 + arcsin(5/6), 2\u03c0 - arcsin(5/6)].\n\nSo, in terms of the range of \u03c6, it's restricted.\n\nSo, since |sin\u03c6| >=5/6, we can write |sin\u03c6| =5/6 + k, where k >=0, but that might not be helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of |sin\u03c6|.\n\nSince sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, and |sin\u03b8| <=1, |sin\u03c6| >=5/6.\n\nSo, |sin\u03c6| =5/6 + t, where t >=0.\n\nBut perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, let's consider that BD\u00b2 =176 sec\u00b2\u03c6 -96.\n\nWe can write BD\u00b2 as 176(1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) -96 = 176 + 176 tan\u00b2\u03c6 -96 = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, since |sin\u03c6| >=5/6, let me express tan\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03c6.\n\ntan\u00b2\u03c6 = (1 - cos\u00b2\u03c6)/cos\u00b2\u03c6 = (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6)/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut sin\u00b2\u03c6 = (5/6)^2 + something.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, express cos\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of sin\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nWe know that cos\u00b2\u03c6 =1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, tan\u00b2\u03c6 = (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6)/ (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, tan\u00b2\u03c6 = (1 - cos\u00b2\u03c6)/cos\u00b2\u03c6 = (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nWait, yes, that's right. So, tan\u00b2\u03c6 = sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut since sin\u00b2\u03c6 + cos\u00b2\u03c6 =1, cos\u00b2\u03c6 =1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, tan\u00b2\u03c6 = sin\u00b2\u03c6 / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 176 sec\u00b2\u03c6 -96 = 176 (1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) -96.\n\nSubstituting tan\u00b2\u03c6:\n\n=176 [1 + (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6)] -96.\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n1 + (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6) = [ (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6) + sin\u00b2\u03c6 ] / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6) ) = 1 / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =176 [1/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6)] -96.\n\nBut 1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6 = cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 176 / cos\u00b2\u03c6 -96.\n\nBut since |sin\u03c6| >=5/6, then sin\u00b2\u03c6 >=25/36.\n\nSo, 1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6 <=1 -25/36 =11/36.\n\nTherefore, cos\u00b2\u03c6 <=11/36.\n\nSo, 1/cos\u00b2\u03c6 >=36/11.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 >=176*(36/11) -96.\n\nCompute 176*(36/11):\n\n176 \u00f711 =16,\n\n16 *36=576.\n\nSo, 176*(36/11)=576.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 >=576 -96=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 >=480.\n\nWait, that seems significant.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, which occurs when cos\u00b2\u03c6 is minimal, i.e., when cos\u00b2\u03c6=11/36, which is when sin\u00b2\u03c6=25/36, so sin\u03c6=5/6 or -5/6.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that.\n\nWait, if |sin\u03c6|=5/6, then sin\u03c6=5/6 or -5/6, and cos\u00b2\u03c6=1 -25/36=11/36, so cos\u03c6=\u00b1sqrt(11)/6.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2=176/(11/36) -96=176*(36/11) -96=16*36 -96=576 -96=480.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses is 480.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses.\" So, if the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, then 480 is the smallest BD\u00b2 can be. So, BD\u00b2 is always >=480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would be 480, because BD\u00b2 is always at least 480, so 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be 480, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would be 480, but since BD\u00b2 is always >=480, any number less than 480 would be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, but 480 itself is attainable. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is 480, because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, so any number greater than 480 would not satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. So, 480 is the infimum, and it is attainable, so it's the greatest lower bound.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses ABCD on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. The diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they are in a square. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm confusing with a kite. Let me think again. No, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me clarify: In a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. So they are perpendicular. Okay, yes, that's correct. So in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n\nSo, given that ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So the diagonals pass through the origin, which is their midpoint.\n\nSo, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, each vertex is symmetric with respect to the origin. So, for example, if point A is (x, y), then point C, which is the opposite vertex, would be (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D would be symmetric in the same way. So, the coordinates are such that A = (x, y), B = (p, q), C = (-x, -y), D = (-p, -q).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think in terms of vectors. Let's denote vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, OA and OC are opposite vectors, as are OB and OD.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other. So, the midpoint of AC is the origin, and the midpoint of BD is the origin. So, points A and C are symmetric about the origin, as are points B and D. So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y); same with B and D.\n\nSo, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, diagonal AC has length from A to C, which is from (x, y) to (-x, -y), so the distance is sqrt[(2x)^2 + (2y)^2] = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Similarly, diagonal BD has length 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes should be -1. Wait, but since we're dealing with vectors, the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular. Vector AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y), but wait, AC is from (x, y) to (-x, -y), so the vector AC is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, vector BD is from B to D, which is (-2p, -2q). Wait, but if the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, vector AC \u00b7 vector BD = (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 4xp + 4yq = 0. So, 4xp + 4yq = 0 => xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, that's one condition.\n\nAnother thing is that all sides are equal. So, the length AB equals BC, etc. Let's compute AB and BC.\n\nPoint A is (x, y), point B is (p, q). The distance AB is sqrt[(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2].\n\nPoint B is (p, q), point C is (-x, -y). The distance BC is sqrt[(-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2].\n\nSince AB = BC, their squares should be equal.\n\nSo, (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2.\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = p\u00b2 - 2xp + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2yq + y\u00b2.\n\nRight side: (-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2 = (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2 = x\u00b2 + 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yq + q\u00b2.\n\nSet them equal:\n\np\u00b2 - 2xp + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2yq + y\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yq + q\u00b2.\n\nSimplify both sides by subtracting x\u00b2 + p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + y\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n-2xp -2yq = 2xp + 2yq.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-2xp -2yq - 2xp -2yq = 0 => -4xp -4yq = 0 => -4(xp + yq) = 0 => xp + yq = 0.\n\nWait, but earlier we had from the perpendicular diagonals that xp + yq = 0. So, this condition is the same as the diagonals being perpendicular. So, in this case, the condition that AB = BC gives the same equation as the diagonals being perpendicular.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, perhaps in a rhombus on a hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin, the condition that AB = BC is automatically satisfied if the diagonals are perpendicular? Or maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, but in general, for a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so maybe in this case, the condition is automatically satisfied. So, perhaps I only need to use the fact that points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, and that the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nSo, let me rephrase the problem: Find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, and the answer is the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, essentially, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is the infimum, and the answer is the supremum of all such numbers less than BD\u00b2. Wait, actually, the problem says the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily small, then the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would be the infimum.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if BD\u00b2 can get as small as possible, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would be negative infinity, which doesn't make sense. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, for all rhombuses, BD\u00b2 is greater than some number, and we need the greatest such number. So, it's like the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombuses, but if the infimum is attainable, then that's the number. If not, then it's just the infimum.\n\nWait, but hyperbola is unbounded, so perhaps BD\u00b2 can be made as small as possible, approaching zero, but never actually reaching zero because the points are on the hyperbola. So, the infimum would be zero. But that can't be, because the question is asking for a number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, so the greatest such number would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is zero. But that seems trivial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, it's a hyperbola opening along the x-axis. So, points on this hyperbola have |x| >= sqrt(20), because x\u00b2/20 >=1. So, the x-coordinate cannot be less than sqrt(20) in magnitude. So, the points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, so their x-coordinates must satisfy |x| >= sqrt(20) \u2248 4.472.\n\nSo, the points can't be too close to the origin. So, perhaps BD\u00b2 cannot be too small.\n\nWait, because if points are on the hyperbola, their coordinates are constrained.\n\nWait, let me try to model this.\n\nLet me parameterize points A and B on the hyperbola.\n\nSince the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, perhaps we can use hyperbola parametrization.\n\nFor hyperbola, a standard parametrization is x = a sec\u03b8, y = b tan\u03b8, where a\u00b2 = 20, b\u00b2=24.\n\nAlternatively, we can use x = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, y = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions: x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t.\n\nLet me try that. Let me denote point A as (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t). Then, point C is (-sqrt(20) cosh t, -sqrt(24) sinh t).\n\nSimilarly, point B can be another point on the hyperbola, say (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s), and point D is (-sqrt(20) cosh s, -sqrt(24) sinh s).\n\nWait, but in this case, the diagonals AC and BD are the lines connecting A to C and B to D, respectively.\n\nBut wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular.\n\nVector AC is from A to C: (-2 sqrt(20) cosh t, -2 sqrt(24) sinh t).\n\nVector BD is from B to D: (-2 sqrt(20) cosh s, -2 sqrt(24) sinh s).\n\nTheir dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, (-2 sqrt(20) cosh t)(-2 sqrt(20) cosh s) + (-2 sqrt(24) sinh t)(-2 sqrt(24) sinh s) = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n4 * 20 * cosh t cosh s + 4 * 24 * sinh t sinh s = 0.\n\nWhich is 80 cosh t cosh s + 96 sinh t sinh s = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 16: 5 cosh t cosh s + 6 sinh t sinh s = 0.\n\nHmm, that's one equation.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think of another approach.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, and the diagonals are AC and BD.\n\nThe diagonals intersect at the origin, so points A and C are (-x, -y) and (x, y), as are points B and D.\n\nSo, the coordinates are A = (x1, y1), C = (-x1, -y1), B = (x2, y2), D = (-x2, -y2).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nLet's compute AB\u00b2 and BC\u00b2.\n\nAB\u00b2 = (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2.\n\nBC\u00b2 = (-x1 - x2)^2 + (-y1 - y2)^2.\n\nSet AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2:\n\n(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 = (-x1 - x2)^2 + (-y1 - y2)^2.\n\nExpand both sides:\n\nLeft side: (x2\u00b2 - 2x1x2 + x1\u00b2) + (y2\u00b2 - 2y1y2 + y1\u00b2).\n\nRight side: (x1\u00b2 + 2x1x2 + x2\u00b2) + (y1\u00b2 + 2y1y2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nSet equal:\n\nx2\u00b2 - 2x1x2 + x1\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 - 2y1y2 + y1\u00b2 = x1\u00b2 + 2x1x2 + x2\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 + 2y1y2 + y2\u00b2.\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nCancel x2\u00b2, x1\u00b2, y2\u00b2, y1\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n-2x1x2 -2y1y2 = 2x1x2 + 2y1y2.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-2x1x2 -2y1y2 -2x1x2 -2y1y2 = 0 => -4x1x2 -4y1y2 = 0 => x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nSo, x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nBut earlier, from the diagonals being perpendicular, we had x1x2 + y1y2 = 0 as well. So, same condition. So, this is consistent.\n\nSo, the condition for the rhombus is that x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nSo, points A and B must satisfy x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nMoreover, points A and B lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 = 1, and x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, now, we have these constraints:\n\n1. x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 =1,\n\n2. x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 =1,\n\n3. x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2. BD is the diagonal connecting points B and D, but D is (-x2, -y2). So, BD is from (x2, y2) to (-x2, -y2). So, the length of BD is sqrt[(-x2 -x2)^2 + (-y2 - y2)^2] = sqrt[(-2x2)^2 + (-2y2)^2] = sqrt[4x2\u00b2 + 4y2\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, AC\u00b2 = 4(x1\u00b2 + y1\u00b2).\n\nSo, we need to find the minimal possible value of BD\u00b2, which is 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2), given the constraints.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all such rhombuses, and then take the greatest number less than that. But if the infimum is achievable, then that's the number. Otherwise, it's the infimum.\n\nSo, perhaps we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of a single variable and find its minimum.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe have points A = (x1, y1), B = (x2, y2) on the hyperbola, satisfying x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parameterize points A and B on the hyperbola such that their coordinates satisfy this condition.\n\nLet me consider parametrizing points A and B.\n\nSince the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, I can use the parametrization x = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, y = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8.\n\nSo, let me denote point A as (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8). Then, point B can be represented as (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6).\n\nThen, the condition x1x2 + y1y2 = 0 becomes:\n\nsqrt(20) sec\u03b8 * sqrt(20) sec\u03c6 + sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 * sqrt(24) tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nSo, 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 = -24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n20/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) = -24 (sin\u03b8 / cos\u03b8)(sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6).\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6:\n\n20 = -24 (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6).\n\nSo, 20 = -24 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 = -6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6.\n\nSo,\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2, which is 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2) = 4*(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nWait, let me compute x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2:\n\nx2\u00b2 = 20 sec\u00b2\u03c6,\n\ny2\u00b2 = 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6,\n\nso x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 = 20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nExpress this in terms of sin\u03c6 and cos\u03c6:\n\nsec\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6,\n\nso x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 = 20(1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6 = 20 + 44 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut tan\u00b2\u03c6 = (sec\u00b2\u03c6 - 1), so:\n\nx2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 = 20 + 44 (sec\u00b2\u03c6 - 1) = 20 + 44 sec\u00b2\u03c6 - 44 = 44 sec\u00b2\u03c6 -24.\n\nWait, that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6.\n\nWait, from earlier, we have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut I need to relate this to BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8 and \u03c6, then use the condition sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6 to find its minimal value.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4*(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6) = 80 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 96 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nExpress tan\u00b2\u03c6 as sec\u00b2\u03c6 -1:\n\n= 80 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 96 (sec\u00b2\u03c6 -1) = 80 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 96 sec\u00b2\u03c6 -96 = 176 sec\u00b2\u03c6 -96.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 176 sec\u00b2\u03c6 -96.\n\nHmm, okay, so we have BD\u00b2 expressed in terms of sec\u00b2\u03c6. But we also have the condition sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWait, but how do \u03b8 and \u03c6 relate? Because points A and B are independent, except for the condition x1x2 + y1y2 =0.\n\nWait, but in our parametrization, we fixed point A as (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8), and point B as (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6). So, the condition x1x2 + y1y2 =0 gives us 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0, which we transformed into sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, we have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut we need to express BD\u00b2 in terms of this condition.\n\nWait, BD\u00b2 is 176 sec\u00b2\u03c6 -96. So, if we can express sec\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, which is -5/6, then maybe we can find BD\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express sec\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03c6.\n\nWe know that sec\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6, but not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, perhaps we can find an expression for cos\u03c6.\n\nWait, from sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut this relates \u03b8 and \u03c6. So, maybe we can write sin\u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03c6).\n\nBut we also know that sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1.\n\nWait, but this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that for a given \u03c6, \u03b8 is determined such that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut then, is there a way to find the minimal BD\u00b2?\n\nWait, perhaps we can express BD\u00b2 as a function of \u03c6, then find its minimum.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 176 sec\u00b2\u03c6 -96.\n\nBut we also have the condition sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, which relates \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nBut we need to ensure that point A is on the hyperbola, so \u03b8 can be any real number except where cos\u03b8 =0, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that for a given \u03c6, \u03b8 is such that sin\u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03c6).\n\nBut \u03b8 must satisfy |sin\u03b8| <=1, so |(-5)/(6 sin\u03c6)| <=1.\n\nWhich implies |5/(6 sin\u03c6)| <=1 => |sin\u03c6| >=5/6.\n\nSo, |sin\u03c6| >=5/6.\n\nTherefore, sin\u03c6 >=5/6 or sin\u03c6 <=-5/6.\n\nTherefore, the angles \u03c6 must lie in regions where |sin\u03c6| >=5/6.\n\nWhich means \u03c6 is in [arcsin(5/6), \u03c0 - arcsin(5/6)] or [\u03c0 + arcsin(5/6), 2\u03c0 - arcsin(5/6)].\n\nSo, in terms of the range of \u03c6, it's restricted.\n\nSo, since |sin\u03c6| >=5/6, we can write |sin\u03c6| =5/6 + k, where k >=0, but that might not be helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of |sin\u03c6|.\n\nSince sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, and |sin\u03b8| <=1, |sin\u03c6| >=5/6.\n\nSo, |sin\u03c6| =5/6 + t, where t >=0.\n\nBut perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, let's consider that BD\u00b2 =176 sec\u00b2\u03c6 -96.\n\nWe can write BD\u00b2 as 176(1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) -96 = 176 + 176 tan\u00b2\u03c6 -96 = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, since |sin\u03c6| >=5/6, let me express tan\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03c6.\n\ntan\u00b2\u03c6 = (1 - cos\u00b2\u03c6)/cos\u00b2\u03c6 = (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6)/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut sin\u00b2\u03c6 = (5/6)^2 + something.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, express cos\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of sin\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nWe know that cos\u00b2\u03c6 =1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, tan\u00b2\u03c6 = (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6)/ (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, tan\u00b2\u03c6 = (1 - cos\u00b2\u03c6)/cos\u00b2\u03c6 = (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nWait, yes, that's right. So, tan\u00b2\u03c6 = sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut since sin\u00b2\u03c6 + cos\u00b2\u03c6 =1, cos\u00b2\u03c6 =1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, tan\u00b2\u03c6 = sin\u00b2\u03c6 / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 176 sec\u00b2\u03c6 -96 = 176 (1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) -96.\n\nSubstituting tan\u00b2\u03c6:\n\n=176 [1 + (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6)] -96.\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n1 + (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6) = [ (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6) + sin\u00b2\u03c6 ] / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6) ) = 1 / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =176 [1/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6)] -96.\n\nBut 1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6 = cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 176 / cos\u00b2\u03c6 -96.\n\nBut since |sin\u03c6| >=5/6, then sin\u00b2\u03c6 >=25/36.\n\nSo, 1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6 <=1 -25/36 =11/36.\n\nTherefore, cos\u00b2\u03c6 <=11/36.\n\nSo, 1/cos\u00b2\u03c6 >=36/11.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 >=176*(36/11) -96.\n\nCompute 176*(36/11):\n\n176 \u00f711 =16,\n\n16 *36=576.\n\nSo, 176*(36/11)=576.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 >=576 -96=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 >=480.\n\nWait, that seems significant.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, which occurs when cos\u00b2\u03c6 is minimal, i.e., when cos\u00b2\u03c6=11/36, which is when sin\u00b2\u03c6=25/36, so sin\u03c6=5/6 or -5/6.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that.\n\nWait, if |sin\u03c6|=5/6, then sin\u03c6=5/6 or -5/6, and cos\u00b2\u03c6=1 -25/36=11/36, so cos\u03c6=\u00b1sqrt(11)/6.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2=176/(11/36) -96=176*(36/11) -96=16*36 -96=576 -96=480.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses is 480.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses.\" So, if the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, then 480 is the smallest BD\u00b2 can be. So, BD\u00b2 is always >=480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would be 480, because BD\u00b2 is always at least 480, so 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be 480, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would be 480, but since BD\u00b2 is always >=480, any number less than 480 would be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, but 480 itself is attainable. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is 480, because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, so any number greater than 480 would not satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. So, 480 is the infimum, and it is attainable, so it's the greatest lower bound.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we consider a rhombus \\(ABCD\\) on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) are perpendicular, and their lengths are determined by the coordinates of points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\).\n\n1. **Parametrization of Points**: Points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) on the hyperbola can be parametrized as \\(A = (\\sqrt{20} \\sec\\theta, \\sqrt{24} \\tan\\theta)\\) and \\(B = (\\sqrt{20} \\sec\\phi, \\sqrt{24} \\tan\\phi)\\).\n\n2. **Condition for Perpendicular Diagonals**: The condition \\(x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = 0\\) (from the perpendicular diagonals) leads to:\n   \\[\n   20 \\sec\\theta \\sec\\phi + 24 \\tan\\theta \\tan\\phi = 0\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we find:\n   \\[\n   \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = -\\frac{5}{6}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expression for \\(BD^2\\)**: The length of diagonal \\(BD\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2)\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(x_2^2 = 20 \\sec^2\\phi\\) and \\(y_2^2 = 24 \\tan^2\\phi\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = 176 \\sec^2\\phi - 96\n   \\]\n\n4. **Minimizing \\(BD^2\\)**: Using the condition \\(\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = -\\frac{5}{6}\\), we find that \\(|\\sin\\phi| \\geq \\frac{5}{6}\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, so I think this is the supremum of BD\u00b2, but not sure yet.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Hmm, no, wait, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, actually, no. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. But in a square, they are. Wait, no, that's not right. I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me think. Yes, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Because the rhombus is a type of kite, and in a kite, one diagonal is the perpendicular bisector of the other. But wait, in a rhombus, both pairs of adjacent sides are equal, so actually, both diagonals are perpendicular bisectors. So yes, the diagonals intersect at right angles.\n\nBut in this problem, the diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin, which is their midpoint. So, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and points B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the origin is the midpoint, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).\n\nSo, all four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, for points A, B, C, D, substituting in the hyperbola equation gives:\n\nFor point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\nFor point B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\nSimilarly, for C and D, but since they are just negatives of A and B, they will satisfy the same equations.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the lengths of AB, BC, CD, DA are equal. Alternatively, since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, perhaps it's easier to work with the diagonals.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, if the diagonals are AC and BD, then they intersect at the origin, and they are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nLet me think about how to represent this. Let\u2019s denote the coordinates of the points as follows:\n\nPoint A: (a, b)\nPoint C: (-a, -b)\nPoint B: (c, d)\nPoint D: (-c, -d)\n\nSo, AC is the diagonal from (a, b) to (-a, -b), and BD is the diagonal from (c, d) to (-c, -d). The diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint.\n\nSince diagonals are perpendicular, the slopes of AC and BD must multiply to -1.\n\nSlope of AC: ( -b - b ) / ( -a - a ) = (-2b)/(-2a) = b/a.\n\nSlope of BD: ( -d - d ) / ( -c - c ) = (-2d)/(-2c) = d/c.\n\nSo, the product of these slopes is (b/a)(d/c) = (bd)/(ac) = -1.\n\nSo, (bd)/(ac) = -1 => bd = -ac.\n\nSo, that's one condition.\n\nAnother condition is that all four points lie on the hyperbola. So, for point A: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1, and for point B: c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, etc., are equal in length.\n\nLet me compute the distance between A and B, which should be equal to the distance between B and C, etc.\n\nDistance AB: sqrt[(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2]\nDistance BC: sqrt[(-a - c)^2 + (-b - d)^2]\nDistance CD: sqrt[(-c + a)^2 + (-d + b)^2]\nDistance DA: sqrt[(a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2]\n\nWait, but for a rhombus, all sides are equal, so AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think in terms of vectors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the properties of the rhombus. Since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, the sides can be expressed in terms of the diagonals.\n\nIn a rhombus, each side is equal to half the square root of the sum of the squares of the diagonals. Wait, no. Wait, in a rhombus, if the diagonals are of lengths p and q, then each side is sqrt[(p/2)^2 + (q/2)^2] = (1/2)sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, in our case, the diagonals AC and BD have lengths sqrt[(2a)^2 + (2b)^2] = 2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2), and sqrt[(2c)^2 + (2d)^2] = 2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the length of diagonal AC is the distance between (a, b) and (-a, -b), which is sqrt[(a - (-a))\u00b2 + (b - (-b))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2a)^2 + (2b)^2] = 2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). Similarly, BD is 2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, each side of the rhombus is (1/2)*sqrt[(2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2))\u00b2 + (2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2))\u00b2] = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, in a rhombus, the length of each side is (1/2)*sqrt( (d1)^2 + (d2)^2 ), where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. So, if the diagonals are AC and BD, then the side length is (1/2)*sqrt( (2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2))\u00b2 + (2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2))\u00b2 ) = (1/2)*sqrt(4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) + 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2)) ) = (1/2)*sqrt(4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + d\u00b2)) ) = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, each side is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). So, all sides are equal, which is consistent.\n\nBut maybe that's not the most helpful approach. Let me think about the slopes and the perpendicularity condition. We had that (bd)/(ac) = -1, so bd = -ac.\n\nAlso, points A and B are on the hyperbola, so:\n\na\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1 ...(1)\n\nc\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1 ...(2)\n\nAlso, from the perpendicularity of diagonals, we have that (b/a)(d/c) = -1 => (bd)/(ac) = -1 => bd = -ac.\n\nSo, I can write d = (-ac)/b, provided that b \u2260 0.\n\nSo, perhaps I can substitute d into equation (2). Let's try that.\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\nc\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSubstitute d = (-ac)/b:\n\nc\u00b2/20 - [ (-ac)/b ]\u00b2 /24 = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\nc\u00b2/20 - (a\u00b2 c\u00b2)/(24 b\u00b2) = 1.\n\nFactor c\u00b2:\n\nc\u00b2 [1/20 - (a\u00b2)/(24 b\u00b2)] = 1.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, perhaps I can parametrize points A and B such that their coordinates satisfy the hyperbola equation and the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize points on the hyperbola using hyperbola parametric equations. For hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, parametric equations are x = a sec\u03b8, y = b tan\u03b8. Alternatively, sometimes people use x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t, but that's for hyperbola parametrization in terms of hyperbolic functions.\n\nWait, but let me think about using the parametric equations. Let me write points A and B in terms of hyperbola parameters.\n\nSo, for point A: x = a sec\u03b8, y = b tan\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, for point B: x = a sec\u03c6, y = b tan\u03c6.\n\nBut since the diagonals are perpendicular, maybe there's a relationship between \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of vectors. The vectors OA and OB would be (a, b) and (c, d). Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors OA and OB must satisfy (a, b) \u22c5 (c, d) = 0? Wait, no. Wait, the diagonals are AC and BD, which are from (a, b) to (-a, -b) and from (c, d) to (-c, -d). So, the vectors for the diagonals would be AC = (-2a, -2b) and BD = (-2c, -2d). Wait, but the diagonals themselves are vectors from A to C and from B to D, but the diagonals as lines are vectors from the origin. Wait, no, the diagonals are the lines connecting A to C and B to D, which pass through the origin.\n\nWait, but the diagonals intersect at the origin, so the origin is the midpoint. So, vectors OA and OB are position vectors of A and B, and vectors OC and OD are their negatives. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, which are the lines from A to C and B to D, passing through the origin.\n\nWait, perhaps the vectors OA and OB are such that OA \u22c5 OB = 0, because the diagonals are perpendicular. Because the diagonals themselves are vectors AC and BD, which would be (-2a, -2b) and (-2c, -2d). Wait, no, wait. The diagonals are the lines connecting A to C and B to D, so the vectors representing these diagonals are AC = C - A = (-a - a, -b - b) = (-2a, -2b) and BD = D - B = (-c - c, -d - d) = (-2c, -2d). So, the vectors for the diagonals are (-2a, -2b) and (-2c, -2d). For these vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero.\n\nSo, (-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 0.\n\nWhich is 4ac + 4bd = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 4: ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, ac + bd = 0.\n\nWhich is the same as bd = -ac, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nSo, now, we have two equations:\n\n1) a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1\n\n2) c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nAnd also, ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express d in terms of a, b, c.\n\nFrom ac + bd = 0 => d = (-ac)/b.\n\nSo, substitute d into equation 2:\n\nc\u00b2/20 - [ (-ac/b )\u00b2 ] /24 = 1\n\nSo, c\u00b2/20 - (a\u00b2 c\u00b2)/(24 b\u00b2) = 1.\n\nFactor c\u00b2:\n\nc\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (a\u00b2)/(24 b\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nHmm, but this seems a bit involved. Maybe I can find a relationship between a and b, and c and d.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a parametric form for points on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, for hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, we can parametrize using hyperbola functions.\n\nLet me use the parametrization:\n\nx = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8\n\ny = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8\n\nSimilarly, for another point, maybe with angle \u03c6.\n\nSo, point A: (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8)\n\nPoint B: (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6)\n\nThen, since diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, the vectors OA and OB must satisfy (OA) \u22c5 (OB) = 0, because the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, no. Wait, earlier I found that the vectors for the diagonals are (-2a, -2b) and (-2c, -2d), and their dot product is zero. So, (-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 0 => 4(ac + bd) = 0 => ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, for points A and B, the condition is a c + b d = 0.\n\nSo, substituting the parametrization:\n\na = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8\n\nb = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8\n\nc = sqrt(20) sec\u03c6\n\nd = sqrt(24) tan\u03c6\n\nSo, substituting into ac + bd = 0:\n\n(sqrt(20) sec\u03b8)(sqrt(20) sec\u03c6) + (sqrt(24) tan\u03b8)(sqrt(24) tan\u03c6) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6) + (24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 4 to simplify:\n\n5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor this or find a relationship between \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 = -6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6\n\nDivide both sides by sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6:\n\n5 = -6 (tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6)/(sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6)\n\nBut tan\u03b8 = sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8, and sec\u03b8 = 1/cos\u03b8.\n\nSo, (tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6)/(sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6) = (sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8)(sin\u03c6/cos\u03c6) / (1/cos\u03b8)(1/cos\u03c6)) = (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) * (cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6)/(1) )= sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6.\n\nSo, 5 = -6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\nThus,\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, the product of sines is -5/6.\n\nHmm, so sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut the maximum value of sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 is 1, but 5/6 is less than 1, so this is possible.\n\nNow, perhaps I can express this in terms of cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) and cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6). Remember that:\n\ncos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) = cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 + sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\ncos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 - sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\nSo, if I have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, then I can write:\n\ncos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) = cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 + (-5/6)\n\nAnd cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 - (-5/6) = cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 + 5/6.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) and cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) in terms of each other.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about BD\u00b2. Since BD is the diagonal from B to D, which has length sqrt[ (c - (-c))\u00b2 + (d - (-d))\u00b2 ] = sqrt[ (2c)^2 + (2d)^2 ] = 2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the points are B: (c, d) and D: (-c, -d). So, the distance between B and D is sqrt[ (-c - c)^2 + (-d - d)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-2c)^2 + (-2d)^2 ] = sqrt[4c\u00b2 + 4d\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, we need to find the supremum (the least upper bound) of BD\u00b2, which is 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), over all possible rhombi ABCD as described.\n\nSo, our goal is to maximize c\u00b2 + d\u00b2, given the constraints.\n\nGiven that point B is on the hyperbola: c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, from this, we can express d\u00b2 in terms of c\u00b2.\n\nFrom equation (2): c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1 => d\u00b2 = (c\u00b2/20 - 1)*24.\n\nSo, d\u00b2 = (24 c\u00b2)/20 - 24 = (6 c\u00b2)/5 - 24.\n\nSo, c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 = c\u00b2 + (6 c\u00b2)/5 - 24 = (5 c\u00b2 + 6 c\u00b2)/5 -24 = (11 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(11 c\u00b2 /5 -24) = (44 c\u00b2)/5 -96.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (44 c\u00b2)/5 -96.\n\nNow, to find the supremum of BD\u00b2, we need to find the maximum possible value of c\u00b2, given the constraints.\n\nWait, but we have another constraint from earlier: sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut in terms of c\u00b2, perhaps I can find the possible values of c\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should express c\u00b2 in terms of the hyperbola equation and the other constraints.\n\nWait, since point B is on the hyperbola, c\u00b2 must satisfy c\u00b2 \u2265 20, because the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 opens along the x-axis, so the minimum x\u00b2 is 20 when y=0.\n\nSo, c\u00b2 \u2265 20.\n\nBut we also have the condition from the perpendicular diagonals, which is ac + bd =0.\n\nWait, in terms of parametrization, we had:\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find the range of possible c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find the maximum possible value of c\u00b2 under the given constraints.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can express c\u00b2 in terms of another variable and find its maximum.\n\nWait, let me think again. From the hyperbola equation, d\u00b2 = (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nBut from the condition ac + bd =0.\n\nWait, in terms of the parametrization, a = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, b = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, c = sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, d = sqrt(24) tan\u03c6.\n\nSo, ac + bd = 0 becomes sqrt(20)*sqrt(20) sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + sqrt(24)*sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nEarlier, I found that this simplifies to sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, perhaps I can write this as:\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, the product of sines is negative, which suggests that \u03b8 and \u03c6 are in opposite quadrants or something like that.\n\nBut perhaps I can think in terms of \u03b8 and \u03c6 such that their sines multiply to -5/6.\n\nBut perhaps I can express this as:\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nNow, I can write this as:\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nLet me consider that:\n\nWe can express this as:\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nAlso, we can think about the maximum and minimum possible values of c\u00b2.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of a single variable.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express \u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nLet me set \u03c6 = \u03c8, so that I can express everything in terms of \u03b8 and \u03c8.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) and cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), as I thought earlier.\n\nWe know that:\n\ncos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) = cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 + sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\ncos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 - sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\nFrom sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, let's compute cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6.\n\nLet me denote cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 as k.\n\nSo, from the above:\n\ncos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) = k + (-5/6)\n\ncos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = k - (-5/6) = k + 5/6\n\nBut I don't know if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) and cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) in terms of k.\n\nBut without more information, maybe it's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the parametrization in terms of hyperbola.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can use another approach. Since points A and B are on the hyperbola, and their position vectors satisfy ac + bd = 0, perhaps I can find the maximum of c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 under these constraints.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nWe have:\n\nc\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nand\n\na c + b d = 0.\n\nBut a and b are related to point A on the hyperbola, so a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe I can express a in terms of b or vice versa.\n\nFrom a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1, we can write a\u00b2 = 20(1 + b\u00b2/24).\n\nSimilarly, from a c + b d =0, we can write a c = -b d.\n\nSo, a = (-b d)/c.\n\nSubstituting into a\u00b2:\n\n[ (-b d)/c ]\u00b2 = 20(1 + b\u00b2/24 )\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 d\u00b2 / c\u00b2 = 20 + (20 b\u00b2)/24\n\nSimplify:\n\n(b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/c\u00b2 = 20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6\n\nMultiply both sides by c\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 d\u00b2 = c\u00b2 (20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 )\n\nBut from the hyperbola equation for point B:\n\nc\u00b2 = 20(1 + d\u00b2/24 )\n\nSo, substitute c\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 d\u00b2 = 20(1 + d\u00b2/24 ) * (20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 )\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but let me try to expand it.\n\nFirst, compute 20*(20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 ) = 400 + (100 b\u00b2)/6 = 400 + (50 b\u00b2)/3.\n\nAnd then, 20*(1 + d\u00b2/24 ) = 20 + (20 d\u00b2)/24 = 20 + (5 d\u00b2)/6.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, c\u00b2 = 20(1 + d\u00b2/24 ), so 20(1 + d\u00b2/24 ) is c\u00b2.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in substitution. Let me re-express.\n\nWe have:\n\nb\u00b2 d\u00b2 = c\u00b2 (20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 )\n\nBut c\u00b2 = 20(1 + d\u00b2/24 )\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nb\u00b2 d\u00b2 = 20(1 + d\u00b2/24 ) * (20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 )\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side:\n\n= 20*(20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 ) + 20*(d\u00b2/24)*(20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 )\n\n= 400 + (100 b\u00b2)/6 + (20 d\u00b2/24)*(20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 )\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n400 is as is.\n\n(100 b\u00b2)/6 = (50 b\u00b2)/3.\n\n(20 d\u00b2/24) = (5 d\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, the third term is (5 d\u00b2/6)*(20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 )\n\n= (5 d\u00b2/6)*20 + (5 d\u00b2/6)*(5 b\u00b2)/6\n\n= (100 d\u00b2)/6 + (25 b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/36\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (50 d\u00b2)/3 + (25 b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/36.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nb\u00b2 d\u00b2 = 400 + (50 b\u00b2)/3 + (50 d\u00b2)/3 + (25 b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/36.\n\nHmm, this looks messy, but perhaps I can collect like terms.\n\nBring everything to one side:\n\nb\u00b2 d\u00b2 - 400 - (50 b\u00b2)/3 - (50 d\u00b2)/3 - (25 b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/36 = 0.\n\nMultiply through by 36 to eliminate denominators:\n\n36 b\u00b2 d\u00b2 - 36*400 - 36*(50 b\u00b2)/3 - 36*(50 d\u00b2)/3 - 25 b\u00b2 d\u00b2 = 0.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n36 b\u00b2 d\u00b2 - 14400 - 600 b\u00b2 - 600 d\u00b2 -25 b\u00b2 d\u00b2 = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(36 b\u00b2 d\u00b2 -25 b\u00b2 d\u00b2) + (-600 b\u00b2) + (-600 d\u00b2) -14400 = 0\n\nWhich is:\n\n11 b\u00b2 d\u00b2 -600 b\u00b2 -600 d\u00b2 -14400 = 0.\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic in terms of b\u00b2 d\u00b2, but it's quite complicated. Maybe I can factor it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that b\u00b2 and d\u00b2 are variables and try to find a relationship between them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a quadratic equation in terms of one variable, say, b\u00b2, treating d\u00b2 as a constant, but that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a quadratic in terms of b\u00b2 d\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider a substitution.\n\nLet me set u = b\u00b2 and v = d\u00b2.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n11 u v -600 u -600 v -14400 = 0.\n\nSo,\n\n11 u v -600 u -600 v = 14400.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor this as:\n\n11 u v -600 u -600 v = 14400.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write it as:\n\n11 u v -600 u -600 v + (600^2)/(11) = 14400 + (600^2)/(11).\n\nWait, that's a technique for factoring, but I'm not sure if it will work here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as:\n\n(11 u -600)(11 v -600) = 600^2 + 11*14400.\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nLet me expand (11u -600)(11v -600):\n\n= 121 u v -600*11 u -600*11 v + 600^2.\n\nBut our equation is 11 u v -600 u -600 v =14400.\n\nHmm, so if I multiply both sides by 11, I get:\n\n121 u v -6600 u -6600 v = 158400.\n\nComparing to (11u -600)(11v -600) = 121 u v -6600 u -6600 v + 360000.\n\nSo, 121 u v -6600 u -6600 v = (11u -600)(11v -600) - 360000.\n\nSo, from our equation, 121 u v -6600 u -6600 v =158400.\n\nSo,\n\n(11u -600)(11v -600) - 360000 = 158400\n\nSo,\n\n(11u -600)(11v -600) = 158400 + 360000 = 518400.\n\nSo,\n\n(11u -600)(11v -600) = 518400.\n\nSo, that's a product of two terms equal to 518400.\n\nHmm, so we have:\n\n(11u -600)(11v -600) = 518400.\n\nBut u = b\u00b2 and v = d\u00b2.\n\nSo, we can write this as:\n\n(11b\u00b2 -600)(11d\u00b2 -600) = 518400.\n\nHmm, but from the hyperbola equation for point B: c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 =1, so d\u00b2 = (c\u00b2/20 -1)*24.\n\nSimilarly, for point A: a\u00b2 = 20(1 + b\u00b2/24).\n\nBut perhaps I can find a relationship between u and v.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the maximum value of c\u00b2 + d\u00b2, which is c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 = c\u00b2 + (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24 = (11 c\u00b2)/5 -24, as I found earlier.\n\nSo, to maximize c\u00b2 + d\u00b2, I need to maximize c\u00b2, given the constraints.\n\nBut c\u00b2 must satisfy the hyperbola equation, so c\u00b2 \u2265 20.\n\nBut from the equation (11u -600)(11v -600) = 518400, and u and v are related via the hyperbola equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use Lagrange multipliers to maximize c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 subject to c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 =1 and ac + bd=0.\n\nBut this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parameterize c\u00b2 as a variable and express d\u00b2 in terms of c\u00b2, then find the maximum possible c\u00b2 under the constraints.\n\nSo, from c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 =1, d\u00b2 = (c\u00b2/20 -1)*24 = (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, d\u00b2 = (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 = c\u00b2 + (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24 = (11 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4*(11 c\u00b2/5 -24 )= (44 c\u00b2)/5 -96.\n\nSo, to maximize BD\u00b2, we need to maximize c\u00b2.\n\nBut we have the constraint from the other equation, which is (11u -600)(11v -600) =518400.\n\nSince u = b\u00b2 and v = d\u00b2, and d\u00b2 = (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24, so v = (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\n(11u -600)(11v -600) =518400.\n\nSo,\n\n(11u -600)(11*(6 c\u00b2/5 -24) -600 ) =518400.\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\n11*(6 c\u00b2/5 -24) -600 = (66 c\u00b2)/5 -264 -600 = (66 c\u00b2)/5 -864.\n\nSo,\n\n(11u -600)*[(66 c\u00b2)/5 -864] =518400.\n\nBut u = b\u00b2, and from point A's hyperbola equation: a\u00b2 =20(1 + b\u00b2/24).\n\nBut from ac + bd=0, we have a c + b d =0.\n\nExpress a in terms of b and c.\n\na = (-b d)/c.\n\nFrom point A's hyperbola equation, a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo,\n\n[ ( (-b d)/c )\u00b2 ] /20 - b\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/(20 c\u00b2) - b\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nFactor b\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 [ d\u00b2/(20 c\u00b2) -1/24 ] =1.\n\nBut from point B's hyperbola equation, d\u00b2 = (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, substitute d\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 [ ( (6 c\u00b2/5 -24) )/(20 c\u00b2) -1/24 ] =1.\n\nSimplify the expression inside the brackets:\n\n= (6 c\u00b2/5 -24)/(20 c\u00b2) -1/24.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n(6 c\u00b2/5 -24)/(20 c\u00b2) = (6 c\u00b2)/(5*20 c\u00b2) -24/(20 c\u00b2) = (6)/(100) - 24/(20 c\u00b2) = 3/50 - 6/(5 c\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\n3/50 -6/(5 c\u00b2) -1/24.\n\nCombine the constants:\n\n3/50 -1/24 = (3*24 - 50*1)/(50*24) = (72 -50)/1200 = 22/1200 = 11/600.\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 [ 11/600 -6/(5 c\u00b2) ] =1.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but perhaps I can write it as:\n\nb\u00b2 [ (11 c\u00b2 - 720 )/(600 c\u00b2) ] =1.\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 (11 c\u00b2 -720 ) = 600 c\u00b2.\n\nHmm, so:\n\nb\u00b2 = (600 c\u00b2)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nBut from the hyperbola equation for point A, a\u00b2 =20(1 + b\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, a\u00b2 =20 + (20 b\u00b2)/24 =20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6.\n\nBut a is expressed in terms of b and d from ac + bd=0.\n\nBut perhaps this is not the most helpful approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express u in terms of c\u00b2.\n\nFrom earlier, we have u = b\u00b2 = (600 c\u00b2)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo, u = (600 c\u00b2)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo, now, let's substitute u into the equation:\n\n(11u -600)(11v -600) =518400.\n\nWe have v = d\u00b2 = (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo,\n\n(11u -600)(11v -600) =518400.\n\nSubstituting u and v:\n\n11u =11*(600 c\u00b2)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ) = (6600 c\u00b2)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 )\n\nSo, 11u -600 = [6600 c\u00b2 -600*(11 c\u00b2 -720 ) ]/(11 c\u00b2 -720 )\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n6600 c\u00b2 -600*(11 c\u00b2 -720 ) =6600 c\u00b2 -6600 c\u00b2 + 432000 =432000.\n\nSo, 11u -600 =432000/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSimilarly, 11v =11*(6 c\u00b2/5 -24 )= (66 c\u00b2)/5 -264.\n\nSo, 11v -600 = (66 c\u00b2)/5 -264 -600 = (66 c\u00b2)/5 -864.\n\nSo, now, the product becomes:\n\n[432000/(11 c\u00b2 -720 )] * [ (66 c\u00b2)/5 -864 ] =518400.\n\nSo,\n\n432000 * [ (66 c\u00b2/5 -864) ] / (11 c\u00b2 -720 ) =518400.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n66 c\u00b2/5 -864 = (66 c\u00b2 -4320)/5.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n432000 * (66 c\u00b2 -4320)/(5*(11 c\u00b2 -720 )) =518400.\n\nSimplify:\n\n432000/(5) * (66 c\u00b2 -4320)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ) =518400.\n\nCompute 432000/5 =86400.\n\nSo,\n\n86400*(66 c\u00b2 -4320)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 )=518400.\n\nDivide both sides by 86400:\n\n(66 c\u00b2 -4320)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ) =518400 /86400 =6.\n\nSo,\n\n(66 c\u00b2 -4320 )=6*(11 c\u00b2 -720 )\n\nExpand RHS:\n\n66 c\u00b2 -4320 =66 c\u00b2 -4320.\n\nWait, that's 66 c\u00b2 -4320 =66 c\u00b2 -4320.\n\nSo, this is an identity, which suggests that our substitution is correct, but it doesn't give us any new information.\n\nHmm, this suggests that our approach might not be working, or perhaps we need a different method.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that the maximum BD\u00b2 occurs when the rhombus is such that the points are placed in specific positions on the hyperbola.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum BD\u00b2 occurs when points B and D are at the vertices of the hyperbola, but wait, the vertices are at (\u00b1sqrt(20), 0). So, if B is at (sqrt(20),0), then d=0, but then from ac + bd=0, since d=0, then ac=0. But then a=0 or c=0, but a and c can't be zero because they are on the hyperbola. So, that's not possible. So, points can't be at the vertices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when the line BD is aligned along the x-axis or y-axis, but given the hyperbola's orientation, perhaps along the x-axis.\n\nWait, if BD is along the x-axis, then points B and D would be (c, 0) and (-c, 0). But then from the hyperbola equation, c\u00b2/20 -0=1 => c\u00b2=20. So, c=\u00b1sqrt(20). But then, from ac + bd=0, since d=0 and b=0 (because points A and C would be (a,0) and (-a,0)), but then from ac + bd=0, we get a*c + b*d = a*c +0= a*c=0. So, either a=0 or c=0, but both can't be because they are on the hyperbola. So, that's impossible. So, BD cannot be along the x-axis.\n\nSimilarly, if BD is along the y-axis, points B and D would be (0, d) and (0, -d). But then from hyperbola equation, 0 - d\u00b2/24=1 => d\u00b2=-24, which is impossible. So, BD cannot be along the y-axis.\n\nSo, BD must be at some angle, not aligned with the axes.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can consider the case when points B and D are such that their coordinates are proportional, i.e., c = k d for some k. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the condition ac + bd =0 to express one variable in terms of another and then maximize c\u00b2 + d\u00b2.\n\nWait, from ac + bd=0, we have a = (-b d)/c.\n\nSubstituting into point A's hyperbola equation:\n\na\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1 => [ (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/c\u00b2 ]/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/(20 c\u00b2) - b\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nFactor b\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 [ d\u00b2/(20 c\u00b2) -1/24 ] =1.\n\nFrom point B's hyperbola equation, d\u00b2 = (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSubstituting:\n\nb\u00b2 [ (6 c\u00b2/5 -24)/(20 c\u00b2) -1/24 ] =1.\n\nLet me compute the expression inside the brackets:\n\n= (6 c\u00b2/5 -24)/(20 c\u00b2) -1/24.\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\n(6 c\u00b2/5 -24)/(20 c\u00b2) = (6 c\u00b2)/(5*20 c\u00b2) -24/(20 c\u00b2) = (6)/(100) - (24)/(20 c\u00b2) = 3/50 - 6/(5 c\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\n3/50 -6/(5 c\u00b2) -1/24.\n\nTo combine these, find a common denominator, which is 600.\n\n3/50 = 36/600\n\n-6/(5 c\u00b2) = -720/(600 c\u00b2)\n\n-1/24 = -25/600\n\nSo,\n\n36/600 -720/(600 c\u00b2) -25/600 = (36 -25)/600 -720/(600 c\u00b2) =11/600 -720/(600 c\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 [11/(600) -720/(600 c\u00b2) ] =1.\n\nFactor out 1/600:\n\nb\u00b2 [ (11 c\u00b2 -720 )/(600 c\u00b2) ] =1.\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 = (600 c\u00b2)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nNow, since b\u00b2 must be positive, the denominator must be positive, so 11 c\u00b2 -720 >0 => c\u00b2 >720/11 \u224865.4545.\n\nSo, c\u00b2 must be greater than 720/11.\n\nBut from point B's hyperbola equation, c\u00b2 must be \u226520.\n\nSo, the valid range for c\u00b2 is c\u00b2 \u2265720/11.\n\nNow, let's compute BD\u00b2 =4*(11 c\u00b2/5 -24 )= (44 c\u00b2)/5 -96.\n\nSo, as c\u00b2 increases beyond 720/11, BD\u00b2 increases.\n\nBut we need to find the supremum, so the maximum possible BD\u00b2 is as c\u00b2 approaches infinity, but that might not be the case because of the constraints.\n\nWait, but from the earlier equation, when c\u00b2 increases, how does it affect the other variables?\n\nWait, when c\u00b2 approaches infinity, from b\u00b2 = (600 c\u00b2)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ), b\u00b2 approaches 600/11 \u224854.545.\n\nSimilarly, d\u00b2 = (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24 approaches infinity.\n\nBut from the hyperbola equation, d\u00b2 must be such that c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nWait, but if c\u00b2 approaches infinity, d\u00b2 approaches (6 c\u00b2)/5, so c\u00b2/20 - (6 c\u00b2/5)/24 = c\u00b2/20 - c\u00b2/(20) =0, which doesn't equal 1. So, that's a problem.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a maximum value of c\u00b2 beyond which the equation is not satisfied.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find the maximum possible c\u00b2 by considering that from the equation (11u -600)(11v -600) =518400, and u = b\u00b2, v = d\u00b2, and from point B's hyperbola equation, v = (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, substituting v into the equation:\n\n(11u -600)(11*(6 c\u00b2/5 -24) -600 ) =518400.\n\nWhich we had earlier simplified to:\n\n(11u -600)(66 c\u00b2/5 -864 )=518400.\n\nBut since we also have u = (600 c\u00b2)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ), we can substitute that into this equation.\n\nSo,\n\n[11*(600 c\u00b2)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ) -600 ]*(66 c\u00b2/5 -864 )=518400.\n\nLet me compute the first term:\n\n11*(600 c\u00b2)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ) -600 = [6600 c\u00b2 -600*(11 c\u00b2 -720 ) ]/(11 c\u00b2 -720 )\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n6600 c\u00b2 -600*11 c\u00b2 +600*720 =6600 c\u00b2 -6600 c\u00b2 +432000=432000.\n\nSo, the first term becomes 432000/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n[432000/(11 c\u00b2 -720 )]*(66 c\u00b2/5 -864 )=518400.\n\nSo,\n\n432000*(66 c\u00b2/5 -864 )/(11 c\u00b2 -720 )=518400.\n\nDivide both sides by 432000:\n\n(66 c\u00b2/5 -864 )/(11 c\u00b2 -720 )=518400/432000=1.2=6/5.\n\nSo,\n\n(66 c\u00b2/5 -864 )= (6/5)(11 c\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 to eliminate denominators:\n\n66 c\u00b2 -4320=6*(11 c\u00b2 -720 )\n\nExpand RHS:\n\n66 c\u00b2 -4320=66 c\u00b2 -4320.\n\nAgain, this reduces to an identity, meaning that the equation holds for all c\u00b2>720/11.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that for any c\u00b2>720/11, the equation holds, which implies that BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large as c\u00b2 increases. But that can't be correct because the hyperbola only extends to infinity, but perhaps there's a physical constraint I'm missing.\n\nWait, but from the hyperbola equation, c\u00b2 can indeed approach infinity as d\u00b2 approaches infinity, but in reality, the hyperbola doesn't have an upper bound on c\u00b2, so BD\u00b2 would approach infinity as well. But the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Wait, but if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, then the supremum would be infinity, but the problem states \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, perhaps the maximum BD\u00b2 is unbounded, but that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that c\u00b2 can approach infinity. Let me check.\n\nFrom the hyperbola equation for point B: c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24=1.\n\nIf c\u00b2 approaches infinity, then d\u00b2 must approach (6 c\u00b2)/5, as d\u00b2= (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, the point B would be moving far along the hyperbola, but the rhombus would have to maintain the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nBut from the earlier analysis, as c\u00b2 increases, BD\u00b2 increases without bound, so the supremum would be infinity. But the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, which would be the infimum of the suprema, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the rhombus must have all four points on the hyperbola, and the diagonals must intersect at the origin. So, perhaps there's a constraint that prevents BD\u00b2 from being too large.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider specific cases where BD\u00b2 is maximized.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum BD\u00b2 occurs when the rhombus is such that the diagonals are the axes of the hyperbola, but that's not possible because the hyperbola's axes are the x and y axes, and in that case, the points would be at the vertices, which we saw earlier is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when the diagonals are aligned with the asymptotes of the hyperbola.\n\nThe asymptotes of the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1 are y = \u00b1(sqrt(24)/sqrt(20))x = \u00b1(2*sqrt(6)/2*sqrt(5))x = \u00b1(sqrt(6)/sqrt(5))x \u2248 \u00b11.0954x.\n\nSo, if the diagonals are aligned with these asymptotes, then points A and B would lie on these lines.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the case for maximum BD\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the points such that the diagonals are perpendicular, and find the maximum BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but earlier I saw that as c\u00b2 increases, BD\u00b2 increases, but that seems to suggest that BD\u00b2 can be made as large as desired, which would mean that the supremum is infinity. But the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, which would imply that BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to some value, but not exceeding it. So, perhaps there's a maximum BD\u00b2 beyond which no rhombus can exist, which would be the case if BD\u00b2 approaches a certain limit.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that c\u00b2 can go to infinity. Let me check the hyperbola equation again.\n\nThe hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1 is a standard hyperbola opening along the x-axis. As x increases, y can increase proportionally according to the asymptotes.\n\nBut in our case, the points are part of a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, so the points must be symmetric about the origin.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the points as being in the first quadrant and their reflections in other quadrants.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum BD\u00b2 occurs when the diagonals are aligned such that the rhombus is 'tilted' as much as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the case where the rhombus is such that the diagonals are perpendicular and the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can use the concept of conjugate diameters in hyperbola.\n\nIn an ellipse, conjugate diameters have certain properties, but in a hyperbola, there's a similar concept.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the points using hyperbola parameters.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSo, parametrizing point B as (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8).\n\nThen, from the condition ac + bd=0, and point A being (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6), we have:\n\nsqrt(20) sec\u03b8 * sqrt(20) sec\u03c6 + sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 * sqrt(24) tan\u03c6 =0.\n\nWhich simplifies to 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6=0.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6=0.\n\nWhich we had earlier, leading to sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nNow, perhaps I can express this in terms of cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) and cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6).\n\nWe know that:\n\ncos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) = cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 + sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\ncos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 - sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\nGiven that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6,\n\nLet me compute cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) and cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6).\n\nLet me denote cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 as k.\n\nThen,\n\ncos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) =k + (-5/6)\n\ncos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) =k - (-5/6) =k +5/6\n\nBut I don't know the value of k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the identity:\n\ncos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) + cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = 2 cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 = 2k.\n\nBut without more information, I can't find k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the maximum of BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nSince BD\u00b2=4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2)=4*(20 sec\u00b2\u03b8 +24 tan\u00b2\u03b8 ).\n\nWait, no. Wait, c\u00b2 is (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8 )\u00b2=20 sec\u00b2\u03b8, and d\u00b2 is (sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 )\u00b2=24 tan\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo, c\u00b2 +d\u00b2=20 sec\u00b2\u03b8 +24 tan\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(20 sec\u00b2\u03b8 +24 tan\u00b2\u03b8 )=80 sec\u00b2\u03b8 +96 tan\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 sec\u00b2\u03b8 +96 tan\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nWe can express this in terms of sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8.\n\nWe know that sec\u00b2\u03b8 =1 + tan\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80(1 + tan\u00b2\u03b8 ) +96 tan\u00b2\u03b8 =80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nNow, since tan\u00b2\u03b8 can be any non-negative real number, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large as tan\u00b2\u03b8 approaches infinity. So, the supremum of BD\u00b2 is infinity.\n\nBut the problem states: \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nWait, that suggests that BD\u00b2 can be as large as possible, but the problem is asking for the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Wait, that doesn't make sense because BD\u00b2 can be made as large as desired, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be negative infinity, which is not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization.\n\nWait, no, because if tan\u03b8 approaches infinity, then BD\u00b2 approaches infinity. So, the maximum possible BD\u00b2 is unbounded. But the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But that would imply that for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is greater than this number, which would be negative infinity, which is not useful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"The last line of your response should be your integer answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nLet $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be points on the hyperbola $\\frac{x^2}{20}- \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the infimum of the suprema of BD\u00b2 across all rhombi, but that seems contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the maximum possible BD\u00b2 that is attainable, not the supremum. But from my analysis, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, so the maximum would be infinity, which is not possible.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization. When I parametrized point B as (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8), and point A as (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6), then the condition ac + bd=0 led to 5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6=0, which led to sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut perhaps I can find the maximum of BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nSince BD\u00b2=80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nBut we also have the condition that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nLet me express \u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nFrom sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nLet me write sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nBut since sin\u03c6 must be between -1 and 1, we have |(-5)/(6 sin\u03b8)| \u22641.\n\nSo,\n\n|5/(6 sin\u03b8)| \u22641 => |sin\u03b8| \u22655/6.\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 \u22655/6 or sin\u03b8 \u2264-5/6.\n\nSo, \u03b8 is in the range where sin\u03b8 is at least 5/6 in magnitude.\n\nSo, \u03b8 is in [arcsin(5/6), \u03c0 - arcsin(5/6)] or [\u03c0 + arcsin(5/6), 2\u03c0 - arcsin(5/6)].\n\nSo, tan\u03b8 is real only when cos\u03b8 \u22600, which is already considered.\n\nNow, from sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, we can write sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nBut we can also express cos\u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nFrom the identity cos\u00b2\u03c6 =1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6 =1 - (25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nSo,\n\ncos\u03c6 = \u00b1sqrt(1 -25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )).\n\nBut the sign of cos\u03c6 depends on the quadrant of \u03c6.\n\nBut since we are dealing with a rhombus, perhaps the sign doesn't matter, but let's proceed.\n\nNow, perhaps I can express BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nWe have BD\u00b2=80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nBut we need to find the maximum BD\u00b2 given the constraint sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut since sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8), and we can express tan\u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to find the maximum of BD\u00b2=80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03b8, given that |sin\u03b8| \u22655/6.\n\nSo, the minimum value of |sin\u03b8| is 5/6, which occurs when \u03b8=arcsin(5/6) or \u03b8=\u03c0 - arcsin(5/6), etc.\n\nSo, when |sin\u03b8|=5/6, then |cos\u03b8|=sqrt(1 -25/36)=sqrt(11/36)=sqrt(11)/6.\n\nSo, tan\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 / cos\u03b8 = (5/6)/(sqrt(11)/6)=5/sqrt(11).\n\nSo, tan\u00b2\u03b8=25/11.\n\nThus, when |sin\u03b8|=5/6, tan\u00b2\u03b8=25/11.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 +176*(25/11)=80 +176*(25/11)=80 + (176/11)*25=80 +16*25=80 +400=480.\n\nSo, when |sin\u03b8|=5/6, BD\u00b2=480.\n\nNow, when |sin\u03b8| increases beyond 5/6 towards 1, tan\u00b2\u03b8 increases, making BD\u00b2 larger.\n\nWait, but when |sin\u03b8|=1, cos\u03b8=0, and tan\u03b8 is undefined. So, as |sin\u03b8| approaches 1, tan\u00b2\u03b8 approaches infinity, making BD\u00b2 approach infinity.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when |sin\u03b8|=5/6, giving BD\u00b2=480, and as |sin\u03b8| increases beyond that, BD\u00b2 increases without bound.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be 480, because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, and can be larger. So, 480 is the minimal possible BD\u00b2, but the problem is asking for the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Wait, that would be 480, because BD\u00b2 is always at least 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, since BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480.\n\nWait, no, wait. If BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480 and as large as infinity, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480. So, 480 is the infimum of BD\u00b2, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, this number must be less than BD\u00b2 for every possible rhombus. Since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, then any number less than 480 would not satisfy the condition because there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2=480. Therefore, the greatest such number is 480 itself, because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2\u2265480, so 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2, but since the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi,\" 480 is the infimum, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, but wait, that's not correct because BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, so 480 is the lower bound, and thus the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, this number must be a lower bound for BD\u00b2 across all rhombi. The smallest possible BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because any number greater than 480 would not satisfy the condition for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=480. Therefore, the answer is 480.\n\nSo, the final answer is 480.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, so I think this is the supremum of BD\u00b2, but not sure yet.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Hmm, no, wait, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, actually, no. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. But in a square, they are. Wait, no, that's not right. I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me think. Yes, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Because the rhombus is a type of kite, and in a kite, one diagonal is the perpendicular bisector of the other. But wait, in a rhombus, both pairs of adjacent sides are equal, so actually, both diagonals are perpendicular bisectors. So yes, the diagonals intersect at right angles.\n\nBut in this problem, the diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin, which is their midpoint. So, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and points B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the origin is the midpoint, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).\n\nSo, all four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, for points A, B, C, D, substituting in the hyperbola equation gives:\n\nFor point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\nFor point B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\nSimilarly, for C and D, but since they are just negatives of A and B, they will satisfy the same equations.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the lengths of AB, BC, CD, DA are equal. Alternatively, since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, perhaps it's easier to work with the diagonals.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, if the diagonals are AC and BD, then they intersect at the origin, and they are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nLet me think about how to represent this. Let\u2019s denote the coordinates of the points as follows:\n\nPoint A: (a, b)\nPoint C: (-a, -b)\nPoint B: (c, d)\nPoint D: (-c, -d)\n\nSo, AC is the diagonal from (a, b) to (-a, -b), and BD is the diagonal from (c, d) to (-c, -d). The diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint.\n\nSince diagonals are perpendicular, the slopes of AC and BD must multiply to -1.\n\nSlope of AC: ( -b - b ) / ( -a - a ) = (-2b)/(-2a) = b/a.\n\nSlope of BD: ( -d - d ) / ( -c - c ) = (-2d)/(-2c) = d/c.\n\nSo, the product of these slopes is (b/a)(d/c) = (bd)/(ac) = -1.\n\nSo, (bd)/(ac) = -1 => bd = -ac.\n\nSo, that's one condition.\n\nAnother condition is that all four points lie on the hyperbola. So, for point A: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1, and for point B: c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, etc., are equal in length.\n\nLet me compute the distance between A and B, which should be equal to the distance between B and C, etc.\n\nDistance AB: sqrt[(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2]\nDistance BC: sqrt[(-a - c)^2 + (-b - d)^2]\nDistance CD: sqrt[(-c + a)^2 + (-d + b)^2]\nDistance DA: sqrt[(a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2]\n\nWait, but for a rhombus, all sides are equal, so AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think in terms of vectors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the properties of the rhombus. Since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, the sides can be expressed in terms of the diagonals.\n\nIn a rhombus, each side is equal to half the square root of the sum of the squares of the diagonals. Wait, no. Wait, in a rhombus, if the diagonals are of lengths p and q, then each side is sqrt[(p/2)^2 + (q/2)^2] = (1/2)sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, in our case, the diagonals AC and BD have lengths sqrt[(2a)^2 + (2b)^2] = 2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2), and sqrt[(2c)^2 + (2d)^2] = 2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the length of diagonal AC is the distance between (a, b) and (-a, -b), which is sqrt[(a - (-a))\u00b2 + (b - (-b))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2a)^2 + (2b)^2] = 2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). Similarly, BD is 2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, each side of the rhombus is (1/2)*sqrt[(2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2))\u00b2 + (2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2))\u00b2] = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, in a rhombus, the length of each side is (1/2)*sqrt( (d1)^2 + (d2)^2 ), where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. So, if the diagonals are AC and BD, then the side length is (1/2)*sqrt( (2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2))\u00b2 + (2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2))\u00b2 ) = (1/2)*sqrt(4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) + 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2)) ) = (1/2)*sqrt(4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + d\u00b2)) ) = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, each side is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). So, all sides are equal, which is consistent.\n\nBut maybe that's not the most helpful approach. Let me think about the slopes and the perpendicularity condition. We had that (bd)/(ac) = -1, so bd = -ac.\n\nAlso, points A and B are on the hyperbola, so:\n\na\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1 ...(1)\n\nc\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1 ...(2)\n\nAlso, from the perpendicularity of diagonals, we have that (b/a)(d/c) = -1 => (bd)/(ac) = -1 => bd = -ac.\n\nSo, I can write d = (-ac)/b, provided that b \u2260 0.\n\nSo, perhaps I can substitute d into equation (2). Let's try that.\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\nc\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSubstitute d = (-ac)/b:\n\nc\u00b2/20 - [ (-ac)/b ]\u00b2 /24 = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\nc\u00b2/20 - (a\u00b2 c\u00b2)/(24 b\u00b2) = 1.\n\nFactor c\u00b2:\n\nc\u00b2 [1/20 - (a\u00b2)/(24 b\u00b2)] = 1.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, perhaps I can parametrize points A and B such that their coordinates satisfy the hyperbola equation and the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize points on the hyperbola using hyperbola parametric equations. For hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, parametric equations are x = a sec\u03b8, y = b tan\u03b8. Alternatively, sometimes people use x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t, but that's for hyperbola parametrization in terms of hyperbolic functions.\n\nWait, but let me think about using the parametric equations. Let me write points A and B in terms of hyperbola parameters.\n\nSo, for point A: x = a sec\u03b8, y = b tan\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, for point B: x = a sec\u03c6, y = b tan\u03c6.\n\nBut since the diagonals are perpendicular, maybe there's a relationship between \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of vectors. The vectors OA and OB would be (a, b) and (c, d). Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors OA and OB must satisfy (a, b) \u22c5 (c, d) = 0? Wait, no. Wait, the diagonals are AC and BD, which are from (a, b) to (-a, -b) and from (c, d) to (-c, -d). So, the vectors for the diagonals would be AC = (-2a, -2b) and BD = (-2c, -2d). Wait, but the diagonals themselves are vectors from A to C and from B to D, but the diagonals as lines are vectors from the origin. Wait, no, the diagonals are the lines connecting A to C and B to D, which pass through the origin.\n\nWait, but the diagonals intersect at the origin, so the origin is the midpoint. So, vectors OA and OB are position vectors of A and B, and vectors OC and OD are their negatives. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, which are the lines from A to C and B to D, passing through the origin.\n\nWait, perhaps the vectors OA and OB are such that OA \u22c5 OB = 0, because the diagonals are perpendicular. Because the diagonals themselves are vectors AC and BD, which would be (-2a, -2b) and (-2c, -2d). Wait, no, wait. The diagonals are the lines connecting A to C and B to D, so the vectors representing these diagonals are AC = C - A = (-a - a, -b - b) = (-2a, -2b) and BD = D - B = (-c - c, -d - d) = (-2c, -2d). So, the vectors for the diagonals are (-2a, -2b) and (-2c, -2d). For these vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero.\n\nSo, (-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 0.\n\nWhich is 4ac + 4bd = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 4: ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, ac + bd = 0.\n\nWhich is the same as bd = -ac, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nSo, now, we have two equations:\n\n1) a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1\n\n2) c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nAnd also, ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express d in terms of a, b, c.\n\nFrom ac + bd = 0 => d = (-ac)/b.\n\nSo, substitute d into equation 2:\n\nc\u00b2/20 - [ (-ac/b )\u00b2 ] /24 = 1\n\nSo, c\u00b2/20 - (a\u00b2 c\u00b2)/(24 b\u00b2) = 1.\n\nFactor c\u00b2:\n\nc\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (a\u00b2)/(24 b\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nHmm, but this seems a bit involved. Maybe I can find a relationship between a and b, and c and d.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a parametric form for points on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, for hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, we can parametrize using hyperbola functions.\n\nLet me use the parametrization:\n\nx = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8\n\ny = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8\n\nSimilarly, for another point, maybe with angle \u03c6.\n\nSo, point A: (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8)\n\nPoint B: (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6)\n\nThen, since diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, the vectors OA and OB must satisfy (OA) \u22c5 (OB) = 0, because the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, no. Wait, earlier I found that the vectors for the diagonals are (-2a, -2b) and (-2c, -2d), and their dot product is zero. So, (-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 0 => 4(ac + bd) = 0 => ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, for points A and B, the condition is a c + b d = 0.\n\nSo, substituting the parametrization:\n\na = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8\n\nb = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8\n\nc = sqrt(20) sec\u03c6\n\nd = sqrt(24) tan\u03c6\n\nSo, substituting into ac + bd = 0:\n\n(sqrt(20) sec\u03b8)(sqrt(20) sec\u03c6) + (sqrt(24) tan\u03b8)(sqrt(24) tan\u03c6) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6) + (24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 4 to simplify:\n\n5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor this or find a relationship between \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 = -6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6\n\nDivide both sides by sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6:\n\n5 = -6 (tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6)/(sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6)\n\nBut tan\u03b8 = sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8, and sec\u03b8 = 1/cos\u03b8.\n\nSo, (tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6)/(sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6) = (sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8)(sin\u03c6/cos\u03c6) / (1/cos\u03b8)(1/cos\u03c6)) = (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) * (cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6)/(1) )= sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6.\n\nSo, 5 = -6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\nThus,\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, the product of sines is -5/6.\n\nHmm, so sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut the maximum value of sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 is 1, but 5/6 is less than 1, so this is possible.\n\nNow, perhaps I can express this in terms of cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) and cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6). Remember that:\n\ncos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) = cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 + sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\ncos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 - sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\nSo, if I have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, then I can write:\n\ncos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) = cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 + (-5/6)\n\nAnd cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 - (-5/6) = cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 + 5/6.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) and cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) in terms of each other.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about BD\u00b2. Since BD is the diagonal from B to D, which has length sqrt[ (c - (-c))\u00b2 + (d - (-d))\u00b2 ] = sqrt[ (2c)^2 + (2d)^2 ] = 2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the points are B: (c, d) and D: (-c, -d). So, the distance between B and D is sqrt[ (-c - c)^2 + (-d - d)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-2c)^2 + (-2d)^2 ] = sqrt[4c\u00b2 + 4d\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, we need to find the supremum (the least upper bound) of BD\u00b2, which is 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), over all possible rhombi ABCD as described.\n\nSo, our goal is to maximize c\u00b2 + d\u00b2, given the constraints.\n\nGiven that point B is on the hyperbola: c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, from this, we can express d\u00b2 in terms of c\u00b2.\n\nFrom equation (2): c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1 => d\u00b2 = (c\u00b2/20 - 1)*24.\n\nSo, d\u00b2 = (24 c\u00b2)/20 - 24 = (6 c\u00b2)/5 - 24.\n\nSo, c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 = c\u00b2 + (6 c\u00b2)/5 - 24 = (5 c\u00b2 + 6 c\u00b2)/5 -24 = (11 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(11 c\u00b2 /5 -24) = (44 c\u00b2)/5 -96.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (44 c\u00b2)/5 -96.\n\nNow, to find the supremum of BD\u00b2, we need to find the maximum possible value of c\u00b2, given the constraints.\n\nWait, but we have another constraint from earlier: sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut in terms of c\u00b2, perhaps I can find the possible values of c\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should express c\u00b2 in terms of the hyperbola equation and the other constraints.\n\nWait, since point B is on the hyperbola, c\u00b2 must satisfy c\u00b2 \u2265 20, because the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 opens along the x-axis, so the minimum x\u00b2 is 20 when y=0.\n\nSo, c\u00b2 \u2265 20.\n\nBut we also have the condition from the perpendicular diagonals, which is ac + bd =0.\n\nWait, in terms of parametrization, we had:\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find the range of possible c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find the maximum possible value of c\u00b2 under the given constraints.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can express c\u00b2 in terms of another variable and find its maximum.\n\nWait, let me think again. From the hyperbola equation, d\u00b2 = (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nBut from the condition ac + bd =0.\n\nWait, in terms of the parametrization, a = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, b = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, c = sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, d = sqrt(24) tan\u03c6.\n\nSo, ac + bd = 0 becomes sqrt(20)*sqrt(20) sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + sqrt(24)*sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nEarlier, I found that this simplifies to sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, perhaps I can write this as:\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, the product of sines is negative, which suggests that \u03b8 and \u03c6 are in opposite quadrants or something like that.\n\nBut perhaps I can think in terms of \u03b8 and \u03c6 such that their sines multiply to -5/6.\n\nBut perhaps I can express this as:\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nNow, I can write this as:\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nLet me consider that:\n\nWe can express this as:\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nAlso, we can think about the maximum and minimum possible values of c\u00b2.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of a single variable.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express \u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nLet me set \u03c6 = \u03c8, so that I can express everything in terms of \u03b8 and \u03c8.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) and cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), as I thought earlier.\n\nWe know that:\n\ncos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) = cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 + sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\ncos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 - sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\nFrom sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, let's compute cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6.\n\nLet me denote cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 as k.\n\nSo, from the above:\n\ncos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) = k + (-5/6)\n\ncos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = k - (-5/6) = k + 5/6\n\nBut I don't know if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) and cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) in terms of k.\n\nBut without more information, maybe it's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the parametrization in terms of hyperbola.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can use another approach. Since points A and B are on the hyperbola, and their position vectors satisfy ac + bd = 0, perhaps I can find the maximum of c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 under these constraints.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nWe have:\n\nc\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nand\n\na c + b d = 0.\n\nBut a and b are related to point A on the hyperbola, so a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe I can express a in terms of b or vice versa.\n\nFrom a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1, we can write a\u00b2 = 20(1 + b\u00b2/24).\n\nSimilarly, from a c + b d =0, we can write a c = -b d.\n\nSo, a = (-b d)/c.\n\nSubstituting into a\u00b2:\n\n[ (-b d)/c ]\u00b2 = 20(1 + b\u00b2/24 )\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 d\u00b2 / c\u00b2 = 20 + (20 b\u00b2)/24\n\nSimplify:\n\n(b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/c\u00b2 = 20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6\n\nMultiply both sides by c\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 d\u00b2 = c\u00b2 (20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 )\n\nBut from the hyperbola equation for point B:\n\nc\u00b2 = 20(1 + d\u00b2/24 )\n\nSo, substitute c\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 d\u00b2 = 20(1 + d\u00b2/24 ) * (20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 )\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but let me try to expand it.\n\nFirst, compute 20*(20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 ) = 400 + (100 b\u00b2)/6 = 400 + (50 b\u00b2)/3.\n\nAnd then, 20*(1 + d\u00b2/24 ) = 20 + (20 d\u00b2)/24 = 20 + (5 d\u00b2)/6.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, c\u00b2 = 20(1 + d\u00b2/24 ), so 20(1 + d\u00b2/24 ) is c\u00b2.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in substitution. Let me re-express.\n\nWe have:\n\nb\u00b2 d\u00b2 = c\u00b2 (20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 )\n\nBut c\u00b2 = 20(1 + d\u00b2/24 )\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nb\u00b2 d\u00b2 = 20(1 + d\u00b2/24 ) * (20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 )\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side:\n\n= 20*(20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 ) + 20*(d\u00b2/24)*(20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 )\n\n= 400 + (100 b\u00b2)/6 + (20 d\u00b2/24)*(20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 )\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n400 is as is.\n\n(100 b\u00b2)/6 = (50 b\u00b2)/3.\n\n(20 d\u00b2/24) = (5 d\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, the third term is (5 d\u00b2/6)*(20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 )\n\n= (5 d\u00b2/6)*20 + (5 d\u00b2/6)*(5 b\u00b2)/6\n\n= (100 d\u00b2)/6 + (25 b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/36\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (50 d\u00b2)/3 + (25 b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/36.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nb\u00b2 d\u00b2 = 400 + (50 b\u00b2)/3 + (50 d\u00b2)/3 + (25 b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/36.\n\nHmm, this looks messy, but perhaps I can collect like terms.\n\nBring everything to one side:\n\nb\u00b2 d\u00b2 - 400 - (50 b\u00b2)/3 - (50 d\u00b2)/3 - (25 b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/36 = 0.\n\nMultiply through by 36 to eliminate denominators:\n\n36 b\u00b2 d\u00b2 - 36*400 - 36*(50 b\u00b2)/3 - 36*(50 d\u00b2)/3 - 25 b\u00b2 d\u00b2 = 0.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n36 b\u00b2 d\u00b2 - 14400 - 600 b\u00b2 - 600 d\u00b2 -25 b\u00b2 d\u00b2 = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(36 b\u00b2 d\u00b2 -25 b\u00b2 d\u00b2) + (-600 b\u00b2) + (-600 d\u00b2) -14400 = 0\n\nWhich is:\n\n11 b\u00b2 d\u00b2 -600 b\u00b2 -600 d\u00b2 -14400 = 0.\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic in terms of b\u00b2 d\u00b2, but it's quite complicated. Maybe I can factor it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that b\u00b2 and d\u00b2 are variables and try to find a relationship between them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a quadratic equation in terms of one variable, say, b\u00b2, treating d\u00b2 as a constant, but that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a quadratic in terms of b\u00b2 d\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider a substitution.\n\nLet me set u = b\u00b2 and v = d\u00b2.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n11 u v -600 u -600 v -14400 = 0.\n\nSo,\n\n11 u v -600 u -600 v = 14400.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor this as:\n\n11 u v -600 u -600 v = 14400.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write it as:\n\n11 u v -600 u -600 v + (600^2)/(11) = 14400 + (600^2)/(11).\n\nWait, that's a technique for factoring, but I'm not sure if it will work here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as:\n\n(11 u -600)(11 v -600) = 600^2 + 11*14400.\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nLet me expand (11u -600)(11v -600):\n\n= 121 u v -600*11 u -600*11 v + 600^2.\n\nBut our equation is 11 u v -600 u -600 v =14400.\n\nHmm, so if I multiply both sides by 11, I get:\n\n121 u v -6600 u -6600 v = 158400.\n\nComparing to (11u -600)(11v -600) = 121 u v -6600 u -6600 v + 360000.\n\nSo, 121 u v -6600 u -6600 v = (11u -600)(11v -600) - 360000.\n\nSo, from our equation, 121 u v -6600 u -6600 v =158400.\n\nSo,\n\n(11u -600)(11v -600) - 360000 = 158400\n\nSo,\n\n(11u -600)(11v -600) = 158400 + 360000 = 518400.\n\nSo,\n\n(11u -600)(11v -600) = 518400.\n\nSo, that's a product of two terms equal to 518400.\n\nHmm, so we have:\n\n(11u -600)(11v -600) = 518400.\n\nBut u = b\u00b2 and v = d\u00b2.\n\nSo, we can write this as:\n\n(11b\u00b2 -600)(11d\u00b2 -600) = 518400.\n\nHmm, but from the hyperbola equation for point B: c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 =1, so d\u00b2 = (c\u00b2/20 -1)*24.\n\nSimilarly, for point A: a\u00b2 = 20(1 + b\u00b2/24).\n\nBut perhaps I can find a relationship between u and v.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the maximum value of c\u00b2 + d\u00b2, which is c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 = c\u00b2 + (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24 = (11 c\u00b2)/5 -24, as I found earlier.\n\nSo, to maximize c\u00b2 + d\u00b2, I need to maximize c\u00b2, given the constraints.\n\nBut c\u00b2 must satisfy the hyperbola equation, so c\u00b2 \u2265 20.\n\nBut from the equation (11u -600)(11v -600) = 518400, and u and v are related via the hyperbola equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use Lagrange multipliers to maximize c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 subject to c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 =1 and ac + bd=0.\n\nBut this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parameterize c\u00b2 as a variable and express d\u00b2 in terms of c\u00b2, then find the maximum possible c\u00b2 under the constraints.\n\nSo, from c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 =1, d\u00b2 = (c\u00b2/20 -1)*24 = (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, d\u00b2 = (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 = c\u00b2 + (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24 = (11 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4*(11 c\u00b2/5 -24 )= (44 c\u00b2)/5 -96.\n\nSo, to maximize BD\u00b2, we need to maximize c\u00b2.\n\nBut we have the constraint from the other equation, which is (11u -600)(11v -600) =518400.\n\nSince u = b\u00b2 and v = d\u00b2, and d\u00b2 = (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24, so v = (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\n(11u -600)(11v -600) =518400.\n\nSo,\n\n(11u -600)(11*(6 c\u00b2/5 -24) -600 ) =518400.\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\n11*(6 c\u00b2/5 -24) -600 = (66 c\u00b2)/5 -264 -600 = (66 c\u00b2)/5 -864.\n\nSo,\n\n(11u -600)*[(66 c\u00b2)/5 -864] =518400.\n\nBut u = b\u00b2, and from point A's hyperbola equation: a\u00b2 =20(1 + b\u00b2/24).\n\nBut from ac + bd=0, we have a c + b d =0.\n\nExpress a in terms of b and c.\n\na = (-b d)/c.\n\nFrom point A's hyperbola equation, a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo,\n\n[ ( (-b d)/c )\u00b2 ] /20 - b\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/(20 c\u00b2) - b\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nFactor b\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 [ d\u00b2/(20 c\u00b2) -1/24 ] =1.\n\nBut from point B's hyperbola equation, d\u00b2 = (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, substitute d\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 [ ( (6 c\u00b2/5 -24) )/(20 c\u00b2) -1/24 ] =1.\n\nSimplify the expression inside the brackets:\n\n= (6 c\u00b2/5 -24)/(20 c\u00b2) -1/24.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n(6 c\u00b2/5 -24)/(20 c\u00b2) = (6 c\u00b2)/(5*20 c\u00b2) -24/(20 c\u00b2) = (6)/(100) - 24/(20 c\u00b2) = 3/50 - 6/(5 c\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\n3/50 -6/(5 c\u00b2) -1/24.\n\nCombine the constants:\n\n3/50 -1/24 = (3*24 - 50*1)/(50*24) = (72 -50)/1200 = 22/1200 = 11/600.\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 [ 11/600 -6/(5 c\u00b2) ] =1.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but perhaps I can write it as:\n\nb\u00b2 [ (11 c\u00b2 - 720 )/(600 c\u00b2) ] =1.\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 (11 c\u00b2 -720 ) = 600 c\u00b2.\n\nHmm, so:\n\nb\u00b2 = (600 c\u00b2)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nBut from the hyperbola equation for point A, a\u00b2 =20(1 + b\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, a\u00b2 =20 + (20 b\u00b2)/24 =20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6.\n\nBut a is expressed in terms of b and d from ac + bd=0.\n\nBut perhaps this is not the most helpful approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express u in terms of c\u00b2.\n\nFrom earlier, we have u = b\u00b2 = (600 c\u00b2)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo, u = (600 c\u00b2)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo, now, let's substitute u into the equation:\n\n(11u -600)(11v -600) =518400.\n\nWe have v = d\u00b2 = (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo,\n\n(11u -600)(11v -600) =518400.\n\nSubstituting u and v:\n\n11u =11*(600 c\u00b2)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ) = (6600 c\u00b2)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 )\n\nSo, 11u -600 = [6600 c\u00b2 -600*(11 c\u00b2 -720 ) ]/(11 c\u00b2 -720 )\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n6600 c\u00b2 -600*(11 c\u00b2 -720 ) =6600 c\u00b2 -6600 c\u00b2 + 432000 =432000.\n\nSo, 11u -600 =432000/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSimilarly, 11v =11*(6 c\u00b2/5 -24 )= (66 c\u00b2)/5 -264.\n\nSo, 11v -600 = (66 c\u00b2)/5 -264 -600 = (66 c\u00b2)/5 -864.\n\nSo, now, the product becomes:\n\n[432000/(11 c\u00b2 -720 )] * [ (66 c\u00b2)/5 -864 ] =518400.\n\nSo,\n\n432000 * [ (66 c\u00b2/5 -864) ] / (11 c\u00b2 -720 ) =518400.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n66 c\u00b2/5 -864 = (66 c\u00b2 -4320)/5.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n432000 * (66 c\u00b2 -4320)/(5*(11 c\u00b2 -720 )) =518400.\n\nSimplify:\n\n432000/(5) * (66 c\u00b2 -4320)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ) =518400.\n\nCompute 432000/5 =86400.\n\nSo,\n\n86400*(66 c\u00b2 -4320)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 )=518400.\n\nDivide both sides by 86400:\n\n(66 c\u00b2 -4320)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ) =518400 /86400 =6.\n\nSo,\n\n(66 c\u00b2 -4320 )=6*(11 c\u00b2 -720 )\n\nExpand RHS:\n\n66 c\u00b2 -4320 =66 c\u00b2 -4320.\n\nWait, that's 66 c\u00b2 -4320 =66 c\u00b2 -4320.\n\nSo, this is an identity, which suggests that our substitution is correct, but it doesn't give us any new information.\n\nHmm, this suggests that our approach might not be working, or perhaps we need a different method.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that the maximum BD\u00b2 occurs when the rhombus is such that the points are placed in specific positions on the hyperbola.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum BD\u00b2 occurs when points B and D are at the vertices of the hyperbola, but wait, the vertices are at (\u00b1sqrt(20), 0). So, if B is at (sqrt(20),0), then d=0, but then from ac + bd=0, since d=0, then ac=0. But then a=0 or c=0, but a and c can't be zero because they are on the hyperbola. So, that's not possible. So, points can't be at the vertices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when the line BD is aligned along the x-axis or y-axis, but given the hyperbola's orientation, perhaps along the x-axis.\n\nWait, if BD is along the x-axis, then points B and D would be (c, 0) and (-c, 0). But then from the hyperbola equation, c\u00b2/20 -0=1 => c\u00b2=20. So, c=\u00b1sqrt(20). But then, from ac + bd=0, since d=0 and b=0 (because points A and C would be (a,0) and (-a,0)), but then from ac + bd=0, we get a*c + b*d = a*c +0= a*c=0. So, either a=0 or c=0, but both can't be because they are on the hyperbola. So, that's impossible. So, BD cannot be along the x-axis.\n\nSimilarly, if BD is along the y-axis, points B and D would be (0, d) and (0, -d). But then from hyperbola equation, 0 - d\u00b2/24=1 => d\u00b2=-24, which is impossible. So, BD cannot be along the y-axis.\n\nSo, BD must be at some angle, not aligned with the axes.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can consider the case when points B and D are such that their coordinates are proportional, i.e., c = k d for some k. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the condition ac + bd =0 to express one variable in terms of another and then maximize c\u00b2 + d\u00b2.\n\nWait, from ac + bd=0, we have a = (-b d)/c.\n\nSubstituting into point A's hyperbola equation:\n\na\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1 => [ (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/c\u00b2 ]/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/(20 c\u00b2) - b\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nFactor b\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 [ d\u00b2/(20 c\u00b2) -1/24 ] =1.\n\nFrom point B's hyperbola equation, d\u00b2 = (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSubstituting:\n\nb\u00b2 [ (6 c\u00b2/5 -24)/(20 c\u00b2) -1/24 ] =1.\n\nLet me compute the expression inside the brackets:\n\n= (6 c\u00b2/5 -24)/(20 c\u00b2) -1/24.\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\n(6 c\u00b2/5 -24)/(20 c\u00b2) = (6 c\u00b2)/(5*20 c\u00b2) -24/(20 c\u00b2) = (6)/(100) - (24)/(20 c\u00b2) = 3/50 - 6/(5 c\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\n3/50 -6/(5 c\u00b2) -1/24.\n\nTo combine these, find a common denominator, which is 600.\n\n3/50 = 36/600\n\n-6/(5 c\u00b2) = -720/(600 c\u00b2)\n\n-1/24 = -25/600\n\nSo,\n\n36/600 -720/(600 c\u00b2) -25/600 = (36 -25)/600 -720/(600 c\u00b2) =11/600 -720/(600 c\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 [11/(600) -720/(600 c\u00b2) ] =1.\n\nFactor out 1/600:\n\nb\u00b2 [ (11 c\u00b2 -720 )/(600 c\u00b2) ] =1.\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 = (600 c\u00b2)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nNow, since b\u00b2 must be positive, the denominator must be positive, so 11 c\u00b2 -720 >0 => c\u00b2 >720/11 \u224865.4545.\n\nSo, c\u00b2 must be greater than 720/11.\n\nBut from point B's hyperbola equation, c\u00b2 must be \u226520.\n\nSo, the valid range for c\u00b2 is c\u00b2 \u2265720/11.\n\nNow, let's compute BD\u00b2 =4*(11 c\u00b2/5 -24 )= (44 c\u00b2)/5 -96.\n\nSo, as c\u00b2 increases beyond 720/11, BD\u00b2 increases.\n\nBut we need to find the supremum, so the maximum possible BD\u00b2 is as c\u00b2 approaches infinity, but that might not be the case because of the constraints.\n\nWait, but from the earlier equation, when c\u00b2 increases, how does it affect the other variables?\n\nWait, when c\u00b2 approaches infinity, from b\u00b2 = (600 c\u00b2)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ), b\u00b2 approaches 600/11 \u224854.545.\n\nSimilarly, d\u00b2 = (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24 approaches infinity.\n\nBut from the hyperbola equation, d\u00b2 must be such that c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nWait, but if c\u00b2 approaches infinity, d\u00b2 approaches (6 c\u00b2)/5, so c\u00b2/20 - (6 c\u00b2/5)/24 = c\u00b2/20 - c\u00b2/(20) =0, which doesn't equal 1. So, that's a problem.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a maximum value of c\u00b2 beyond which the equation is not satisfied.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find the maximum possible c\u00b2 by considering that from the equation (11u -600)(11v -600) =518400, and u = b\u00b2, v = d\u00b2, and from point B's hyperbola equation, v = (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, substituting v into the equation:\n\n(11u -600)(11*(6 c\u00b2/5 -24) -600 ) =518400.\n\nWhich we had earlier simplified to:\n\n(11u -600)(66 c\u00b2/5 -864 )=518400.\n\nBut since we also have u = (600 c\u00b2)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ), we can substitute that into this equation.\n\nSo,\n\n[11*(600 c\u00b2)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ) -600 ]*(66 c\u00b2/5 -864 )=518400.\n\nLet me compute the first term:\n\n11*(600 c\u00b2)/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ) -600 = [6600 c\u00b2 -600*(11 c\u00b2 -720 ) ]/(11 c\u00b2 -720 )\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n6600 c\u00b2 -600*11 c\u00b2 +600*720 =6600 c\u00b2 -6600 c\u00b2 +432000=432000.\n\nSo, the first term becomes 432000/(11 c\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n[432000/(11 c\u00b2 -720 )]*(66 c\u00b2/5 -864 )=518400.\n\nSo,\n\n432000*(66 c\u00b2/5 -864 )/(11 c\u00b2 -720 )=518400.\n\nDivide both sides by 432000:\n\n(66 c\u00b2/5 -864 )/(11 c\u00b2 -720 )=518400/432000=1.2=6/5.\n\nSo,\n\n(66 c\u00b2/5 -864 )= (6/5)(11 c\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 to eliminate denominators:\n\n66 c\u00b2 -4320=6*(11 c\u00b2 -720 )\n\nExpand RHS:\n\n66 c\u00b2 -4320=66 c\u00b2 -4320.\n\nAgain, this reduces to an identity, meaning that the equation holds for all c\u00b2>720/11.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that for any c\u00b2>720/11, the equation holds, which implies that BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large as c\u00b2 increases. But that can't be correct because the hyperbola only extends to infinity, but perhaps there's a physical constraint I'm missing.\n\nWait, but from the hyperbola equation, c\u00b2 can indeed approach infinity as d\u00b2 approaches infinity, but in reality, the hyperbola doesn't have an upper bound on c\u00b2, so BD\u00b2 would approach infinity as well. But the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Wait, but if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, then the supremum would be infinity, but the problem states \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, perhaps the maximum BD\u00b2 is unbounded, but that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that c\u00b2 can approach infinity. Let me check.\n\nFrom the hyperbola equation for point B: c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24=1.\n\nIf c\u00b2 approaches infinity, then d\u00b2 must approach (6 c\u00b2)/5, as d\u00b2= (6 c\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, the point B would be moving far along the hyperbola, but the rhombus would have to maintain the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nBut from the earlier analysis, as c\u00b2 increases, BD\u00b2 increases without bound, so the supremum would be infinity. But the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, which would be the infimum of the suprema, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the rhombus must have all four points on the hyperbola, and the diagonals must intersect at the origin. So, perhaps there's a constraint that prevents BD\u00b2 from being too large.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider specific cases where BD\u00b2 is maximized.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum BD\u00b2 occurs when the rhombus is such that the diagonals are the axes of the hyperbola, but that's not possible because the hyperbola's axes are the x and y axes, and in that case, the points would be at the vertices, which we saw earlier is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when the diagonals are aligned with the asymptotes of the hyperbola.\n\nThe asymptotes of the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1 are y = \u00b1(sqrt(24)/sqrt(20))x = \u00b1(2*sqrt(6)/2*sqrt(5))x = \u00b1(sqrt(6)/sqrt(5))x \u2248 \u00b11.0954x.\n\nSo, if the diagonals are aligned with these asymptotes, then points A and B would lie on these lines.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the case for maximum BD\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the points such that the diagonals are perpendicular, and find the maximum BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but earlier I saw that as c\u00b2 increases, BD\u00b2 increases, but that seems to suggest that BD\u00b2 can be made as large as desired, which would mean that the supremum is infinity. But the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, which would imply that BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to some value, but not exceeding it. So, perhaps there's a maximum BD\u00b2 beyond which no rhombus can exist, which would be the case if BD\u00b2 approaches a certain limit.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that c\u00b2 can go to infinity. Let me check the hyperbola equation again.\n\nThe hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1 is a standard hyperbola opening along the x-axis. As x increases, y can increase proportionally according to the asymptotes.\n\nBut in our case, the points are part of a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, so the points must be symmetric about the origin.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the points as being in the first quadrant and their reflections in other quadrants.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum BD\u00b2 occurs when the diagonals are aligned such that the rhombus is 'tilted' as much as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the case where the rhombus is such that the diagonals are perpendicular and the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can use the concept of conjugate diameters in hyperbola.\n\nIn an ellipse, conjugate diameters have certain properties, but in a hyperbola, there's a similar concept.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the points using hyperbola parameters.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSo, parametrizing point B as (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8).\n\nThen, from the condition ac + bd=0, and point A being (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6), we have:\n\nsqrt(20) sec\u03b8 * sqrt(20) sec\u03c6 + sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 * sqrt(24) tan\u03c6 =0.\n\nWhich simplifies to 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6=0.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6=0.\n\nWhich we had earlier, leading to sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nNow, perhaps I can express this in terms of cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) and cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6).\n\nWe know that:\n\ncos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) = cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 + sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\ncos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 - sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\nGiven that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6,\n\nLet me compute cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) and cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6).\n\nLet me denote cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 as k.\n\nThen,\n\ncos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) =k + (-5/6)\n\ncos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) =k - (-5/6) =k +5/6\n\nBut I don't know the value of k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the identity:\n\ncos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) + cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = 2 cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 = 2k.\n\nBut without more information, I can't find k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the maximum of BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nSince BD\u00b2=4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2)=4*(20 sec\u00b2\u03b8 +24 tan\u00b2\u03b8 ).\n\nWait, no. Wait, c\u00b2 is (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8 )\u00b2=20 sec\u00b2\u03b8, and d\u00b2 is (sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 )\u00b2=24 tan\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo, c\u00b2 +d\u00b2=20 sec\u00b2\u03b8 +24 tan\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(20 sec\u00b2\u03b8 +24 tan\u00b2\u03b8 )=80 sec\u00b2\u03b8 +96 tan\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 sec\u00b2\u03b8 +96 tan\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nWe can express this in terms of sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8.\n\nWe know that sec\u00b2\u03b8 =1 + tan\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80(1 + tan\u00b2\u03b8 ) +96 tan\u00b2\u03b8 =80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nNow, since tan\u00b2\u03b8 can be any non-negative real number, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large as tan\u00b2\u03b8 approaches infinity. So, the supremum of BD\u00b2 is infinity.\n\nBut the problem states: \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nWait, that suggests that BD\u00b2 can be as large as possible, but the problem is asking for the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Wait, that doesn't make sense because BD\u00b2 can be made as large as desired, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be negative infinity, which is not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization.\n\nWait, no, because if tan\u03b8 approaches infinity, then BD\u00b2 approaches infinity. So, the maximum possible BD\u00b2 is unbounded. But the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But that would imply that for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is greater than this number, which would be negative infinity, which is not useful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"The last line of your response should be your integer answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nLet $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be points on the hyperbola $\\frac{x^2}{20}- \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the infimum of the suprema of BD\u00b2 across all rhombi, but that seems contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the maximum possible BD\u00b2 that is attainable, not the supremum. But from my analysis, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, so the maximum would be infinity, which is not possible.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization. When I parametrized point B as (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8), and point A as (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6), then the condition ac + bd=0 led to 5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6=0, which led to sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut perhaps I can find the maximum of BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nSince BD\u00b2=80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nBut we also have the condition that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nLet me express \u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nFrom sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nLet me write sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nBut since sin\u03c6 must be between -1 and 1, we have |(-5)/(6 sin\u03b8)| \u22641.\n\nSo,\n\n|5/(6 sin\u03b8)| \u22641 => |sin\u03b8| \u22655/6.\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 \u22655/6 or sin\u03b8 \u2264-5/6.\n\nSo, \u03b8 is in the range where sin\u03b8 is at least 5/6 in magnitude.\n\nSo, \u03b8 is in [arcsin(5/6), \u03c0 - arcsin(5/6)] or [\u03c0 + arcsin(5/6), 2\u03c0 - arcsin(5/6)].\n\nSo, tan\u03b8 is real only when cos\u03b8 \u22600, which is already considered.\n\nNow, from sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, we can write sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nBut we can also express cos\u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nFrom the identity cos\u00b2\u03c6 =1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6 =1 - (25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nSo,\n\ncos\u03c6 = \u00b1sqrt(1 -25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )).\n\nBut the sign of cos\u03c6 depends on the quadrant of \u03c6.\n\nBut since we are dealing with a rhombus, perhaps the sign doesn't matter, but let's proceed.\n\nNow, perhaps I can express BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nWe have BD\u00b2=80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nBut we need to find the maximum BD\u00b2 given the constraint sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut since sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8), and we can express tan\u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to find the maximum of BD\u00b2=80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03b8, given that |sin\u03b8| \u22655/6.\n\nSo, the minimum value of |sin\u03b8| is 5/6, which occurs when \u03b8=arcsin(5/6) or \u03b8=\u03c0 - arcsin(5/6), etc.\n\nSo, when |sin\u03b8|=5/6, then |cos\u03b8|=sqrt(1 -25/36)=sqrt(11/36)=sqrt(11)/6.\n\nSo, tan\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 / cos\u03b8 = (5/6)/(sqrt(11)/6)=5/sqrt(11).\n\nSo, tan\u00b2\u03b8=25/11.\n\nThus, when |sin\u03b8|=5/6, tan\u00b2\u03b8=25/11.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 +176*(25/11)=80 +176*(25/11)=80 + (176/11)*25=80 +16*25=80 +400=480.\n\nSo, when |sin\u03b8|=5/6, BD\u00b2=480.\n\nNow, when |sin\u03b8| increases beyond 5/6 towards 1, tan\u00b2\u03b8 increases, making BD\u00b2 larger.\n\nWait, but when |sin\u03b8|=1, cos\u03b8=0, and tan\u03b8 is undefined. So, as |sin\u03b8| approaches 1, tan\u00b2\u03b8 approaches infinity, making BD\u00b2 approach infinity.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when |sin\u03b8|=5/6, giving BD\u00b2=480, and as |sin\u03b8| increases beyond that, BD\u00b2 increases without bound.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be 480, because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, and can be larger. So, 480 is the minimal possible BD\u00b2, but the problem is asking for the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Wait, that would be 480, because BD\u00b2 is always at least 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, since BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480.\n\nWait, no, wait. If BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480 and as large as infinity, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480. So, 480 is the infimum of BD\u00b2, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, this number must be less than BD\u00b2 for every possible rhombus. Since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, then any number less than 480 would not satisfy the condition because there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2=480. Therefore, the greatest such number is 480 itself, because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2\u2265480, so 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2, but since the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi,\" 480 is the infimum, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, but wait, that's not correct because BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, so 480 is the lower bound, and thus the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, this number must be a lower bound for BD\u00b2 across all rhombi. The smallest possible BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because any number greater than 480 would not satisfy the condition for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=480. Therefore, the answer is 480.\n\nSo, the final answer is 480.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus \\(ABCD\\) on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where there's a hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola and form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, they are. Wait, no, wait\u2014actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yeah, that's right. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So that's an important property.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola as well. The hyperbola is centered at (0,0), so that makes sense. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular to each other. Let me denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Then, since the diagonals bisect each other, points A and C are symmetric with respect to the origin, and similarly, points B and D are symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y), and if point B is (p, q), then point D is (-p, -q).\n\nSo, the four points are A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), D(-p, -q). All four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, plugging A into the hyperbola equation: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. Similarly, plugging B into the equation: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, AB = BC = CD = DA. Let me express the vectors AB and BC in terms of coordinates.\n\nVector AB is from A to B: (p - x, q - y). Vector BC is from B to C: (-x - p, -y - q). The length of AB squared is (p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2. Similarly, the length of BC squared is (-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2.\n\nSince AB = BC, their squared lengths should be equal. So,\n\n(p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2 = (-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2.\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: (p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2) + (q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2) = p\u00b2 + x\u00b2 - 2px + q\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2qy.\n\nRight side: ((-x - p)\u00b2) = (x + p)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2px + p\u00b2, similarly for the y-component: (-y - q)\u00b2 = (y + q)\u00b2 = y\u00b2 + 2qy + q\u00b2.\n\nSo right side is x\u00b2 + 2px + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2qy + q\u00b2.\n\nSetting left and right equal:\n\np\u00b2 + x\u00b2 - 2px + q\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2qy = x\u00b2 + 2px + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2qy + q\u00b2.\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft: x\u00b2 + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2px - 2qy.\n\nRight: x\u00b2 + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2px + 2qy.\n\nSubtracting right from left:\n\n(-2px - 2qy) - (2px + 2qy) = 0.\n\nWhich becomes: -4px -4qy = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by -4: px + qy = 0.\n\nSo, we get the equation px + qy = 0. That's one condition.\n\nSimilarly, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular. Let's see: vector AC is from A to C: (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Vector BD is from B to D: (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q). Wait, actually, the vectors AC and BD are the diagonals. So, if the diagonals are perpendicular, then their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, vector AC is (2x, 2y) if you go from C to A, but since it's a diagonal, perhaps better to consider direction. Wait, no. The vectors AC and BD are the diagonals, so their direction is from A to C and from B to D, respectively.\n\nWait, actually, the vectors AC and BD are from the origin to points C and D, but wait, no. The diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD, so the vectors representing the diagonals are AC = C - A = (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD = D - B = (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q). Wait, but in reality, the diagonal AC is from A to C, which is (C - A) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is (D - B) = (-2p, -2q).\n\nBut the diagonals are vectors that cross each other at the origin, so perhaps the vectors themselves should be considered as from the origin. Wait, no. The diagonals of the rhombus are the line segments connecting opposite vertices. So, the vector for diagonal AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y). The vector for diagonal BD is from B to D, which is (-2p, -2q). These two vectors must be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0.\n\nWait, let me compute that: (-2x)(-2p) = 4xp, and (-2y)(-2q) = 4yq. So, 4xp + 4yq = 0. Divide both sides by 4: xp + yq = 0. Hmm, that's the same as the equation we got before: px + qy = 0. So, that's consistent. So, that's one equation.\n\nSo, now, we have two equations:\n\n1. px + qy = 0.\n\n2. A and B lie on the hyperbola: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 and p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAdditionally, since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, so the distances AB, BC, etc., are equal. But we already used that to get px + qy = 0.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider another pair of sides. For example, AB and AD. Let me see.\n\nVector AB is (p - x, q - y), vector AD is (-p - x, -q - y). The lengths of AB and AD must be equal.\n\nSo, (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (-p - x)^2 + (-q - y)^2.\n\nLet me compute both sides.\n\nLeft: (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2.\n\nRight: (-p - x)^2 + (-q - y)^2 = (p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2 = p\u00b2 + 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qy + y\u00b2.\n\nSet them equal:\n\np\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qy + y\u00b2.\n\nSimplify: subtract right from left.\n\n-4px -4qy = 0.\n\nWhich is the same as px + qy = 0. So, same equation again. So, no new information here.\n\nSo, the main condition is px + qy = 0.\n\nSo, we have two points A(x, y) and B(p, q) on the hyperbola, with px + qy = 0.\n\nI need to find BD squared. Wait, BD is the diagonal from B to D. Wait, but D is (-p, -q), so BD is the distance between B(p, q) and D(-p, -q). So, BD squared is (p - (-p))\u00b2 + (q - (-q))\u00b2 = (2p)^2 + (2q)^2 = 4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD squared is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Therefore, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, I need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nSo, in other words, find the infimum of BD\u00b2, or perhaps the minimum possible BD\u00b2? Wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" Hmm, that sounds like the infimum, because it's the greatest lower bound. So, I need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, and then the answer would be that minimum, or perhaps the supremum of BD\u00b2? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because it's the greatest number that is less than or equal to all BD\u00b2. Wait, but actually, since it's \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi,\" it's the supremum of the lower bounds of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about it differently. Let's consider that BD\u00b2 can vary depending on the rhombus. So, the problem is asking for the greatest number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all possible such rhombi. So, m is the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is greater than m, and m is the greatest such number.\n\nSo, I need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi ABCD as described.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, we need to minimize p\u00b2 + q\u00b2, given that (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1, and px + qy = 0, with x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have two hyperbola equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\n2. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAnd the condition px + qy = 0.\n\nSo, we have four variables x, y, p, q with these three equations.\n\nI need to find the minimum of p\u00b2 + q\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 is the square of the distance from the origin to point B(p, q), which lies on the hyperbola. So, BD\u00b2 = 4*(distance from origin to B)^2.\n\nSo, minimizing BD\u00b2 is equivalent to minimizing the square of the distance from B to the origin, given that B is on the hyperbola and satisfies px + qy = 0, where A(x, y) is another point on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parameterize the points A and B on the hyperbola.\n\nFor hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, parametrization can be done using hyperbolic functions. So, let's let A be (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), where a\u00b2=20, so a=\u221a20=2\u221a5, and b\u00b2=24, so b=2\u221a6.\n\nSo, point A is (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, point B can be parametrized as (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6).\n\nThen, the condition px + qy = 0 becomes:\n\n(2\u221a5 sec\u03c6)(2\u221a5 sec\u03b8) + (2\u221a6 tan\u03c6)(2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) = 0.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n(2\u221a5 sec\u03c6)(2\u221a5 sec\u03b8) = (4*5) sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 = 20 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, (2\u221a6 tan\u03c6)(2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) = (4*6) tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 = 24 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8.\n\nSo, the condition is 20 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 + 24 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 = 0.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can express this in terms of trigonometric identities.\n\nLet me recall that sec\u03c6 = 1/cos\u03c6, tan\u03c6 = sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6. So, let me write the equation:\n\n20 * (1 / cos\u03c6) * (1 / cos\u03b8) + 24 * (sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6) * (sin\u03b8 / cos\u03b8) = 0.\n\nFactor out 1/(cos\u03c6 cos\u03b8):\n\n[20 + 24 sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8] / (cos\u03c6 cos\u03b8) = 0.\n\nSince the denominator is non-zero (unless cos\u03c6 or cos\u03b8 is zero, but on a hyperbola, x can't be zero, so cos\u03c6 and cos\u03b8 can't be zero), so the numerator must be zero:\n\n20 + 24 sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = 0.\n\nSo,\n\n24 sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -20.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n6 sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5.\n\nSo,\n\nsin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, the product of sines is -5/6.\n\nSo, sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6.\n\nBut wait, the maximum value of sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 is 1, but here it's -5/6, which is within the range [-1, 1]. So, it's possible.\n\nSo, now, with this condition, I can perhaps express one angle in terms of the other.\n\nLet me denote \u03b8 as a parameter, and then express \u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express tan\u03c6 in terms of tan\u03b8, but I'm not sure. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this as:\n\nsin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nWait, but sin\u03c6 must satisfy |sin\u03c6| \u2264 1.\n\nSo,\n\n| (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8) | \u2264 1.\n\nSo,\n\n|5/(6 sin\u03b8)| \u2264 1.\n\nWhich implies,\n\n|sin\u03b8| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, |sin\u03b8| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, \u03b8 must be such that sin\u03b8 is either \u2265 5/6 or \u2264 -5/6.\n\nSo, \u03b8 is in [arcsin(5/6), \u03c0 - arcsin(5/6)] or [\u03c0 + arcsin(5/6), 2\u03c0 - arcsin(5/6)].\n\nHmm, okay. So, this condition restricts \u03b8 to certain ranges.\n\nNow, our goal is to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSince p = 2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, q = 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = (20 sec\u00b2\u03c6) + (24 tan\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nLet me express this in terms of sin\u03c6 and cos\u03c6.\n\nWe know that sec\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6, so:\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20(1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6 = 20 + 44 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4*(20 + 44 tan\u00b2\u03c6) = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut tan\u00b2\u03c6 is non-negative, so the minimal value occurs when tan\u00b2\u03c6 is as small as possible, i.e., tan\u03c6 = 0. But wait, if tan\u03c6 = 0, then sin\u03c6 = 0, but earlier we had sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6, which would imply 0 = -5/6, which is impossible. So, tan\u03c6 can't be zero.\n\nSo, the minimal value is not achieved at tan\u03c6=0. So, perhaps we need to find the minimal value of tan\u00b2\u03c6 given the condition sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6.\n\nHmm. Let me see. Let's denote t = tan\u03c6. Then, tan\u03c6 = t, so sin\u03c6 = t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, from the condition sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6,\n\n(t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)) sin\u03b8 = -5/6.\n\nSo,\n\nsin\u03b8 = (-5/6) * sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)/t.\n\nBut we also know that point A lies on the hyperbola, so point A is (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). So, let's compute the coordinates of A.\n\nBut wait, perhaps we can find a relationship between t and \u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express sin\u03b8 in terms of t, then use the hyperbola equation for point A to find a condition.\n\nWait, point A is (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). So, plugging into the hyperbola equation:\n\n( (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8)^2 ) / 20 - ( (2\u221a6 tan\u03b8)^2 ) / 24 = 1.\n\nCompute this:\n\n( (20 sec\u00b2\u03b8) ) / 20 - ( (24 tan\u00b2\u03b8) ) / 24 = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\nsec\u00b2\u03b8 - tan\u00b2\u03b8 = 1.\n\nBut sec\u00b2\u03b8 - tan\u00b2\u03b8 = 1, which is a trigonometric identity, so it's always true. So, that doesn't give us any new information. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, perhaps I need another approach. Let me consider the condition sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6 and try to relate tan\u03c6 and tan\u03b8.\n\nLet me denote t = tan\u03c6, s = tan\u03b8.\n\nWe have sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6.\n\nExpress sin\u03c6 and sin\u03b8 in terms of t and s:\n\nsin\u03c6 = t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nsin\u03b8 = s / sqrt(1 + s\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\n(t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)) * (s / sqrt(1 + s\u00b2)) = -5/6.\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n(t\u00b2 (1 + s\u00b2)) / ( (1 + t\u00b2)(1 + s\u00b2) ) = (25)/(36).\n\nWait, wait, let me compute:\n\n(t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)) * (s / sqrt(1 + s\u00b2)) = -5/6.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(t\u00b2 (1 + s\u00b2)) / ( (1 + t\u00b2)(1 + s\u00b2) ) = 25/36.\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as:\n\n(t s) / sqrt( (1 + t\u00b2)(1 + s\u00b2) ) = \u00b15/6.\n\nBut since the left side is t s divided by sqrt( (1 + t\u00b2)(1 + s\u00b2) ), which is the sine of the angle between the two vectors (\u03c6 and \u03b8), but I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the ratio t/s.\n\nLet me let k = t/s. Then, t = k s.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n(k s * s) / sqrt( (1 + k\u00b2 s\u00b2)(1 + s\u00b2) ) = \u00b15/6.\n\nWait, that's:\n\n(k s\u00b2) / sqrt( (1 + k\u00b2 s\u00b2)(1 + s\u00b2) ) = \u00b15/6.\n\nHmm, this might not be the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that from point A and point B, we can think of the product of their coordinates.\n\nWait, from point A: x = 2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, y = 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8.\n\nFrom point B: p = 2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, q = 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6.\n\nSo, the condition px + qy = 0 is:\n\n(2\u221a5 sec\u03c6)(2\u221a5 sec\u03b8) + (2\u221a6 tan\u03c6)(2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to 20 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 + 24 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 = 0, as before.\n\nSo, 20 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 = -24 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 = -6 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8.\n\nExpress sec\u03c6 in terms of cos\u03c6, and tan\u03c6 as sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6:\n\n5 / (cos\u03c6 cos\u03b8) = -6 (sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6)(sin\u03b8 / cos\u03b8).\n\nSimplify:\n\n5 / (cos\u03c6 cos\u03b8) = -6 (sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8) / (cos\u03c6 cos\u03b8).\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u03c6 cos\u03b8:\n\n5 = -6 sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\nsin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6.\n\nSo, this is consistent with what we had earlier.\n\nNow, perhaps I can express sin\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03b8, or vice versa.\n\nFrom sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6,\n\nsin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nSo, if I can express BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8, perhaps I can find its minimum.\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 4*(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nSo, let's express this in terms of sin\u03c6 and cos\u03c6.\n\nWe have:\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nExpress in terms of sin\u03c6:\n\nsec\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 / cos\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6).\n\ntan\u00b2\u03c6 = sin\u00b2\u03c6 / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6) + 24 sin\u00b2\u03c6 / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= (20 + 24 sin\u00b2\u03c6) / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nBut from sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8), so sin\u00b2\u03c6 = (25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = [20 + 24*(25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)] / [1 - (25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)].\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 20 + (24*25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) = 20 + (600)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) = 20 + (50)/(3 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nDenominator: 1 - (25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) = (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = [20 + (50)/(3 sin\u00b2\u03b8)] / [ (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) ].\n\nWhich is equal to:\n\n[ (20 * 36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 50 * 12 ) / (3 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) ] / [ (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) ]\n\nWait, let me compute numerator:\n\n20 + 50/(3 sin\u00b2\u03b8) = (20 * 3 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 50) / (3 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nSo, numerator is (60 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 50)/(3 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nDenominator is (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = [ (60 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 50)/(3 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) ] / [ (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) ]\n\nWhich is equal to:\n\n[ (60 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 50) / (3 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) ] * [ (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25) ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ (60 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 50) * 36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ] / [ 3 sin\u00b2\u03b8 * (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25) ) ]\n\nCancel 3 sin\u00b2\u03b8:\n\n= [ (60 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 50) * 12 ] / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25 )\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n60 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 50 = 10*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 5).\n\nSo,\n\n= [ 10*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5 ) * 12 ] / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25 )\n\n= 120*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5 ) / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 4 * [ 120*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5 ) / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 ) ]\n\nWait, no. Wait, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 was equal to that fraction, so BD\u00b2 is 4 times that.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * [ 120*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5 ) / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 ) ]\n\n= 480*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5 ) / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 )\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can simplify this expression.\n\nLet me denote u = sin\u00b2\u03b8. Then, since |sin\u03b8| \u2265 5/6, as we saw earlier, u \u2265 (5/6)^2 = 25/36.\n\nSo, u \u2265 25/36.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 as a function of u is:\n\nBD\u00b2(u) = 480*(6u +5 ) / (36u -25 )\n\nWe need to find the minimum of BD\u00b2(u) for u \u2265 25/36.\n\nSo, let's consider f(u) = (6u +5)/(36u -25). We need to find the minimum of f(u), then multiply by 480.\n\nSo, f(u) = (6u +5)/(36u -25).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nf(u) = (6u +5)/(36u -25) = [6u +5]/[36u -25].\n\nLet me compute the derivative of f(u) with respect to u to find its extrema.\n\nf'(u) = [ (6)(36u -25) - (6u +5)(36) ] / (36u -25)^2.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n6*(36u -25) - 36*(6u +5) = 216u - 150 - 216u - 180.\n\nSimplify:\n\n216u -150 -216u -180 = -330.\n\nSo, f'(u) = (-330)/(36u -25)^2.\n\nSince the denominator is positive when u > 25/36 (because 36u -25 > 0 when u >25/36), the derivative is negative. So, f(u) is decreasing for u >25/36.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of f(u) occurs at the maximum u. But wait, u can be as large as possible, but let's see the constraints.\n\nWait, u = sin\u00b2\u03b8, which can be at most 1. So, u \u2208 [25/36, 1].\n\nSince f(u) is decreasing on [25/36, 1], the minimal value of f(u) is achieved at u=1, and the maximum at u=25/36.\n\nSo, f(u) is minimized at u=1, so BD\u00b2 is minimized at u=1.\n\nSo, compute f(1):\n\nf(1) = (6*1 +5)/(36*1 -25) = (11)/(11) = 1.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480 * f(u) = 480 *1 = 480.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480?\n\nBut wait, when u approaches 25/36 from above, let's see what happens to f(u):\n\nf(25/36) = (6*(25/36) +5)/(36*(25/36) -25) = ( (150/36 +5 ) ) / (25 -25) = (150/36 + 180/36 ) / 0 = (330/36)/0 \u2192 infinity.\n\nSo, as u approaches 25/36 from above, f(u) approaches infinity, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut at u=1, f(u)=1, so BD\u00b2=480. So, is 480 the minimal value?\n\nWait, but when u increases beyond 25/36, f(u) decreases. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, achieved when u=1.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, but can it be smaller? Since f(u) is decreasing, the minimal value is 480.\n\nWait, but let me verify if u=1 is allowed.\n\nAt u=1, sin\u03b8 = \u00b11, so \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2.\n\nSo, point A would be (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). But when sin\u03b8=1, cos\u03b8=0, so sec\u03b8 is undefined. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, when sin\u03b8=1, cos\u03b8=0, so sec\u03b8 is 1/cos\u03b8, which is undefined. So, that suggests that u cannot be 1, because then point A would be at infinity.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, actually, u cannot be equal to 1 because that would place point A at infinity, which is not possible. So, u can approach 1, but cannot reach it. Therefore, BD\u00b2 can approach 480, but cannot actually reach it.\n\nSo, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, but it's not achieved. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be 480, because BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but never less than 480.\n\nWait, but no, hold on. Wait, if BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above, meaning BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as desired but is always greater than 480, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, since BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480. So, 480 is the infimum.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that would be 480, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480, but can be as close to 480 as we like. Therefore, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my reasoning.\n\nWe found that BD\u00b2 = 480*(6u +5)/(36u -25), where u = sin\u00b2\u03b8 \u226525/36.\n\nWe saw that f(u) is decreasing on u \u226525/36, so as u increases, f(u) decreases.\n\nBut u can't reach 1, because that would put point A at infinity. So, u approaches 1 from below, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480*(6*1 +5)/(36*1 -25) = 480*11/11 = 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480.\n\nTherefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because if BD\u00b2 approaches 480, then for any number less than 480, say 480 - \u03b5, we can find a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than 480 - \u03b5? No, wait, no. Because as u approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, so 480 is the lower bound. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 from above, then 480 is the infimum. So, for any m <480, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 < m is not true, because BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired. So, the problem is asking for the greatest number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, m must be less than or equal to 480. But since BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as we like, m cannot be greater than 480. So, the greatest such m is 480.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory because 480 is the infimum, so for any m <480, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than m. Wait, no, because BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above, meaning BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480. So, for any m <480, BD\u00b2 is always greater than m, so m can be as close to 480 as we like, but m must be less than 480.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it this way: For the problem, we need the greatest number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, m must be less than or equal to the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 480. But since BD\u00b2 can approach 480, the greatest m is 480, because m must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but since BD\u00b2 can be as close to 480 as desired, the only m that satisfies m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is m \u2264480. But the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, then 480 is the infimum. So, for any number greater than 480, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than that number. But for numbers less than 480, BD\u00b2 is always greater than that number. So, the greatest number m that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because 480 is the infimum, meaning BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as we want, but is always greater than or equal to 480. So, m must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, m must be less than or equal to 480. But since BD\u00b2 can be as close to 480 as we like, the greatest m is 480.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, so 480 is the lower bound. So, 480 is the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose m is 480. Then, m < BD\u00b2 is 480 < BD\u00b2. But BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480? No, because when u approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, so 480 is the infimum. So, m can be 480, since for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 >480, so 480 < BD\u00b2. Therefore, 480 is the greatest such number.\n\nWait, but earlier, when u approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, but never actually reaches it. So, technically, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480. So, 480 is the infimum, but it's not attained. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\nBut let me check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Points A and B on hyperbola.\n\n2. Diagonals intersect at origin, so points are symmetric.\n\n3. Derived condition px + qy =0.\n\n4. Expressed points in terms of hyperbolic functions.\n\n5. Derived BD\u00b2 in terms of u = sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\n6. Found that BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as u approaches 1.\n\n7. Concluded that 480 is the infimum.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 480.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{480}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where there's a hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola and form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, they are. Wait, no, wait\u2014actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yeah, that's right. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So that's an important property.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola as well. The hyperbola is centered at (0,0), so that makes sense. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular to each other. Let me denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Then, since the diagonals bisect each other, points A and C are symmetric with respect to the origin, and similarly, points B and D are symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y), and if point B is (p, q), then point D is (-p, -q).\n\nSo, the four points are A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), D(-p, -q). All four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, plugging A into the hyperbola equation: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. Similarly, plugging B into the equation: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, AB = BC = CD = DA. Let me express the vectors AB and BC in terms of coordinates.\n\nVector AB is from A to B: (p - x, q - y). Vector BC is from B to C: (-x - p, -y - q). The length of AB squared is (p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2. Similarly, the length of BC squared is (-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2.\n\nSince AB = BC, their squared lengths should be equal. So,\n\n(p - x)\u00b2 + (q - y)\u00b2 = (-x - p)\u00b2 + (-y - q)\u00b2.\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: (p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2) + (q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2) = p\u00b2 + x\u00b2 - 2px + q\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2qy.\n\nRight side: ((-x - p)\u00b2) = (x + p)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2px + p\u00b2, similarly for the y-component: (-y - q)\u00b2 = (y + q)\u00b2 = y\u00b2 + 2qy + q\u00b2.\n\nSo right side is x\u00b2 + 2px + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2qy + q\u00b2.\n\nSetting left and right equal:\n\np\u00b2 + x\u00b2 - 2px + q\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2qy = x\u00b2 + 2px + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2qy + q\u00b2.\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft: x\u00b2 + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2px - 2qy.\n\nRight: x\u00b2 + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2px + 2qy.\n\nSubtracting right from left:\n\n(-2px - 2qy) - (2px + 2qy) = 0.\n\nWhich becomes: -4px -4qy = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by -4: px + qy = 0.\n\nSo, we get the equation px + qy = 0. That's one condition.\n\nSimilarly, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular. Let's see: vector AC is from A to C: (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Vector BD is from B to D: (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q). Wait, actually, the vectors AC and BD are the diagonals. So, if the diagonals are perpendicular, then their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, vector AC is (2x, 2y) if you go from C to A, but since it's a diagonal, perhaps better to consider direction. Wait, no. The vectors AC and BD are the diagonals, so their direction is from A to C and from B to D, respectively.\n\nWait, actually, the vectors AC and BD are from the origin to points C and D, but wait, no. The diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD, so the vectors representing the diagonals are AC = C - A = (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD = D - B = (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q). Wait, but in reality, the diagonal AC is from A to C, which is (C - A) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is (D - B) = (-2p, -2q).\n\nBut the diagonals are vectors that cross each other at the origin, so perhaps the vectors themselves should be considered as from the origin. Wait, no. The diagonals of the rhombus are the line segments connecting opposite vertices. So, the vector for diagonal AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y). The vector for diagonal BD is from B to D, which is (-2p, -2q). These two vectors must be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0.\n\nWait, let me compute that: (-2x)(-2p) = 4xp, and (-2y)(-2q) = 4yq. So, 4xp + 4yq = 0. Divide both sides by 4: xp + yq = 0. Hmm, that's the same as the equation we got before: px + qy = 0. So, that's consistent. So, that's one equation.\n\nSo, now, we have two equations:\n\n1. px + qy = 0.\n\n2. A and B lie on the hyperbola: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 and p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAdditionally, since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, so the distances AB, BC, etc., are equal. But we already used that to get px + qy = 0.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider another pair of sides. For example, AB and AD. Let me see.\n\nVector AB is (p - x, q - y), vector AD is (-p - x, -q - y). The lengths of AB and AD must be equal.\n\nSo, (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (-p - x)^2 + (-q - y)^2.\n\nLet me compute both sides.\n\nLeft: (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2.\n\nRight: (-p - x)^2 + (-q - y)^2 = (p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2 = p\u00b2 + 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qy + y\u00b2.\n\nSet them equal:\n\np\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + 2px + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qy + y\u00b2.\n\nSimplify: subtract right from left.\n\n-4px -4qy = 0.\n\nWhich is the same as px + qy = 0. So, same equation again. So, no new information here.\n\nSo, the main condition is px + qy = 0.\n\nSo, we have two points A(x, y) and B(p, q) on the hyperbola, with px + qy = 0.\n\nI need to find BD squared. Wait, BD is the diagonal from B to D. Wait, but D is (-p, -q), so BD is the distance between B(p, q) and D(-p, -q). So, BD squared is (p - (-p))\u00b2 + (q - (-q))\u00b2 = (2p)^2 + (2q)^2 = 4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD squared is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Therefore, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, I need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nSo, in other words, find the infimum of BD\u00b2, or perhaps the minimum possible BD\u00b2? Wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" Hmm, that sounds like the infimum, because it's the greatest lower bound. So, I need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, and then the answer would be that minimum, or perhaps the supremum of BD\u00b2? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because it's the greatest number that is less than or equal to all BD\u00b2. Wait, but actually, since it's \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi,\" it's the supremum of the lower bounds of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about it differently. Let's consider that BD\u00b2 can vary depending on the rhombus. So, the problem is asking for the greatest number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all possible such rhombi. So, m is the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is greater than m, and m is the greatest such number.\n\nSo, I need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi ABCD as described.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, we need to minimize p\u00b2 + q\u00b2, given that (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1, and px + qy = 0, with x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have two hyperbola equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\n2. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAnd the condition px + qy = 0.\n\nSo, we have four variables x, y, p, q with these three equations.\n\nI need to find the minimum of p\u00b2 + q\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 is the square of the distance from the origin to point B(p, q), which lies on the hyperbola. So, BD\u00b2 = 4*(distance from origin to B)^2.\n\nSo, minimizing BD\u00b2 is equivalent to minimizing the square of the distance from B to the origin, given that B is on the hyperbola and satisfies px + qy = 0, where A(x, y) is another point on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parameterize the points A and B on the hyperbola.\n\nFor hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, parametrization can be done using hyperbolic functions. So, let's let A be (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), where a\u00b2=20, so a=\u221a20=2\u221a5, and b\u00b2=24, so b=2\u221a6.\n\nSo, point A is (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, point B can be parametrized as (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6).\n\nThen, the condition px + qy = 0 becomes:\n\n(2\u221a5 sec\u03c6)(2\u221a5 sec\u03b8) + (2\u221a6 tan\u03c6)(2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) = 0.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n(2\u221a5 sec\u03c6)(2\u221a5 sec\u03b8) = (4*5) sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 = 20 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, (2\u221a6 tan\u03c6)(2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) = (4*6) tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 = 24 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8.\n\nSo, the condition is 20 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 + 24 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 = 0.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can express this in terms of trigonometric identities.\n\nLet me recall that sec\u03c6 = 1/cos\u03c6, tan\u03c6 = sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6. So, let me write the equation:\n\n20 * (1 / cos\u03c6) * (1 / cos\u03b8) + 24 * (sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6) * (sin\u03b8 / cos\u03b8) = 0.\n\nFactor out 1/(cos\u03c6 cos\u03b8):\n\n[20 + 24 sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8] / (cos\u03c6 cos\u03b8) = 0.\n\nSince the denominator is non-zero (unless cos\u03c6 or cos\u03b8 is zero, but on a hyperbola, x can't be zero, so cos\u03c6 and cos\u03b8 can't be zero), so the numerator must be zero:\n\n20 + 24 sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = 0.\n\nSo,\n\n24 sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -20.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n6 sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5.\n\nSo,\n\nsin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, the product of sines is -5/6.\n\nSo, sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6.\n\nBut wait, the maximum value of sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 is 1, but here it's -5/6, which is within the range [-1, 1]. So, it's possible.\n\nSo, now, with this condition, I can perhaps express one angle in terms of the other.\n\nLet me denote \u03b8 as a parameter, and then express \u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express tan\u03c6 in terms of tan\u03b8, but I'm not sure. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this as:\n\nsin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nWait, but sin\u03c6 must satisfy |sin\u03c6| \u2264 1.\n\nSo,\n\n| (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8) | \u2264 1.\n\nSo,\n\n|5/(6 sin\u03b8)| \u2264 1.\n\nWhich implies,\n\n|sin\u03b8| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, |sin\u03b8| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, \u03b8 must be such that sin\u03b8 is either \u2265 5/6 or \u2264 -5/6.\n\nSo, \u03b8 is in [arcsin(5/6), \u03c0 - arcsin(5/6)] or [\u03c0 + arcsin(5/6), 2\u03c0 - arcsin(5/6)].\n\nHmm, okay. So, this condition restricts \u03b8 to certain ranges.\n\nNow, our goal is to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSince p = 2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, q = 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = (20 sec\u00b2\u03c6) + (24 tan\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nLet me express this in terms of sin\u03c6 and cos\u03c6.\n\nWe know that sec\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6, so:\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20(1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6 = 20 + 44 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4*(20 + 44 tan\u00b2\u03c6) = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut tan\u00b2\u03c6 is non-negative, so the minimal value occurs when tan\u00b2\u03c6 is as small as possible, i.e., tan\u03c6 = 0. But wait, if tan\u03c6 = 0, then sin\u03c6 = 0, but earlier we had sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6, which would imply 0 = -5/6, which is impossible. So, tan\u03c6 can't be zero.\n\nSo, the minimal value is not achieved at tan\u03c6=0. So, perhaps we need to find the minimal value of tan\u00b2\u03c6 given the condition sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6.\n\nHmm. Let me see. Let's denote t = tan\u03c6. Then, tan\u03c6 = t, so sin\u03c6 = t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, from the condition sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6,\n\n(t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)) sin\u03b8 = -5/6.\n\nSo,\n\nsin\u03b8 = (-5/6) * sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)/t.\n\nBut we also know that point A lies on the hyperbola, so point A is (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). So, let's compute the coordinates of A.\n\nBut wait, perhaps we can find a relationship between t and \u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express sin\u03b8 in terms of t, then use the hyperbola equation for point A to find a condition.\n\nWait, point A is (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). So, plugging into the hyperbola equation:\n\n( (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8)^2 ) / 20 - ( (2\u221a6 tan\u03b8)^2 ) / 24 = 1.\n\nCompute this:\n\n( (20 sec\u00b2\u03b8) ) / 20 - ( (24 tan\u00b2\u03b8) ) / 24 = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\nsec\u00b2\u03b8 - tan\u00b2\u03b8 = 1.\n\nBut sec\u00b2\u03b8 - tan\u00b2\u03b8 = 1, which is a trigonometric identity, so it's always true. So, that doesn't give us any new information. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, perhaps I need another approach. Let me consider the condition sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6 and try to relate tan\u03c6 and tan\u03b8.\n\nLet me denote t = tan\u03c6, s = tan\u03b8.\n\nWe have sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6.\n\nExpress sin\u03c6 and sin\u03b8 in terms of t and s:\n\nsin\u03c6 = t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nsin\u03b8 = s / sqrt(1 + s\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\n(t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)) * (s / sqrt(1 + s\u00b2)) = -5/6.\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n(t\u00b2 (1 + s\u00b2)) / ( (1 + t\u00b2)(1 + s\u00b2) ) = (25)/(36).\n\nWait, wait, let me compute:\n\n(t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)) * (s / sqrt(1 + s\u00b2)) = -5/6.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(t\u00b2 (1 + s\u00b2)) / ( (1 + t\u00b2)(1 + s\u00b2) ) = 25/36.\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as:\n\n(t s) / sqrt( (1 + t\u00b2)(1 + s\u00b2) ) = \u00b15/6.\n\nBut since the left side is t s divided by sqrt( (1 + t\u00b2)(1 + s\u00b2) ), which is the sine of the angle between the two vectors (\u03c6 and \u03b8), but I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the ratio t/s.\n\nLet me let k = t/s. Then, t = k s.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n(k s * s) / sqrt( (1 + k\u00b2 s\u00b2)(1 + s\u00b2) ) = \u00b15/6.\n\nWait, that's:\n\n(k s\u00b2) / sqrt( (1 + k\u00b2 s\u00b2)(1 + s\u00b2) ) = \u00b15/6.\n\nHmm, this might not be the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that from point A and point B, we can think of the product of their coordinates.\n\nWait, from point A: x = 2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, y = 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8.\n\nFrom point B: p = 2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, q = 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6.\n\nSo, the condition px + qy = 0 is:\n\n(2\u221a5 sec\u03c6)(2\u221a5 sec\u03b8) + (2\u221a6 tan\u03c6)(2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to 20 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 + 24 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 = 0, as before.\n\nSo, 20 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 = -24 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 = -6 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8.\n\nExpress sec\u03c6 in terms of cos\u03c6, and tan\u03c6 as sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6:\n\n5 / (cos\u03c6 cos\u03b8) = -6 (sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6)(sin\u03b8 / cos\u03b8).\n\nSimplify:\n\n5 / (cos\u03c6 cos\u03b8) = -6 (sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8) / (cos\u03c6 cos\u03b8).\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u03c6 cos\u03b8:\n\n5 = -6 sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\nsin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6.\n\nSo, this is consistent with what we had earlier.\n\nNow, perhaps I can express sin\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03b8, or vice versa.\n\nFrom sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6,\n\nsin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8).\n\nSo, if I can express BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8, perhaps I can find its minimum.\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 4*(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nSo, let's express this in terms of sin\u03c6 and cos\u03c6.\n\nWe have:\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nExpress in terms of sin\u03c6:\n\nsec\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 / cos\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6).\n\ntan\u00b2\u03c6 = sin\u00b2\u03c6 / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6) + 24 sin\u00b2\u03c6 / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= (20 + 24 sin\u00b2\u03c6) / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nBut from sin\u03c6 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03b8), so sin\u00b2\u03c6 = (25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = [20 + 24*(25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)] / [1 - (25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)].\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 20 + (24*25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) = 20 + (600)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) = 20 + (50)/(3 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nDenominator: 1 - (25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) = (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = [20 + (50)/(3 sin\u00b2\u03b8)] / [ (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) ].\n\nWhich is equal to:\n\n[ (20 * 36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 50 * 12 ) / (3 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) ] / [ (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) ]\n\nWait, let me compute numerator:\n\n20 + 50/(3 sin\u00b2\u03b8) = (20 * 3 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 50) / (3 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nSo, numerator is (60 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 50)/(3 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nDenominator is (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = [ (60 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 50)/(3 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) ] / [ (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) ]\n\nWhich is equal to:\n\n[ (60 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 50) / (3 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) ] * [ (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25) ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ (60 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 50) * 36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ] / [ 3 sin\u00b2\u03b8 * (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25) ) ]\n\nCancel 3 sin\u00b2\u03b8:\n\n= [ (60 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 50) * 12 ] / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25 )\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n60 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 50 = 10*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 5).\n\nSo,\n\n= [ 10*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5 ) * 12 ] / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25 )\n\n= 120*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5 ) / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 4 * [ 120*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5 ) / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 ) ]\n\nWait, no. Wait, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 was equal to that fraction, so BD\u00b2 is 4 times that.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * [ 120*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5 ) / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 ) ]\n\n= 480*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5 ) / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 )\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can simplify this expression.\n\nLet me denote u = sin\u00b2\u03b8. Then, since |sin\u03b8| \u2265 5/6, as we saw earlier, u \u2265 (5/6)^2 = 25/36.\n\nSo, u \u2265 25/36.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 as a function of u is:\n\nBD\u00b2(u) = 480*(6u +5 ) / (36u -25 )\n\nWe need to find the minimum of BD\u00b2(u) for u \u2265 25/36.\n\nSo, let's consider f(u) = (6u +5)/(36u -25). We need to find the minimum of f(u), then multiply by 480.\n\nSo, f(u) = (6u +5)/(36u -25).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nf(u) = (6u +5)/(36u -25) = [6u +5]/[36u -25].\n\nLet me compute the derivative of f(u) with respect to u to find its extrema.\n\nf'(u) = [ (6)(36u -25) - (6u +5)(36) ] / (36u -25)^2.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n6*(36u -25) - 36*(6u +5) = 216u - 150 - 216u - 180.\n\nSimplify:\n\n216u -150 -216u -180 = -330.\n\nSo, f'(u) = (-330)/(36u -25)^2.\n\nSince the denominator is positive when u > 25/36 (because 36u -25 > 0 when u >25/36), the derivative is negative. So, f(u) is decreasing for u >25/36.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of f(u) occurs at the maximum u. But wait, u can be as large as possible, but let's see the constraints.\n\nWait, u = sin\u00b2\u03b8, which can be at most 1. So, u \u2208 [25/36, 1].\n\nSince f(u) is decreasing on [25/36, 1], the minimal value of f(u) is achieved at u=1, and the maximum at u=25/36.\n\nSo, f(u) is minimized at u=1, so BD\u00b2 is minimized at u=1.\n\nSo, compute f(1):\n\nf(1) = (6*1 +5)/(36*1 -25) = (11)/(11) = 1.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480 * f(u) = 480 *1 = 480.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480?\n\nBut wait, when u approaches 25/36 from above, let's see what happens to f(u):\n\nf(25/36) = (6*(25/36) +5)/(36*(25/36) -25) = ( (150/36 +5 ) ) / (25 -25) = (150/36 + 180/36 ) / 0 = (330/36)/0 \u2192 infinity.\n\nSo, as u approaches 25/36 from above, f(u) approaches infinity, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut at u=1, f(u)=1, so BD\u00b2=480. So, is 480 the minimal value?\n\nWait, but when u increases beyond 25/36, f(u) decreases. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, achieved when u=1.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, but can it be smaller? Since f(u) is decreasing, the minimal value is 480.\n\nWait, but let me verify if u=1 is allowed.\n\nAt u=1, sin\u03b8 = \u00b11, so \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2.\n\nSo, point A would be (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). But when sin\u03b8=1, cos\u03b8=0, so sec\u03b8 is undefined. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, when sin\u03b8=1, cos\u03b8=0, so sec\u03b8 is 1/cos\u03b8, which is undefined. So, that suggests that u cannot be 1, because then point A would be at infinity.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, actually, u cannot be equal to 1 because that would place point A at infinity, which is not possible. So, u can approach 1, but cannot reach it. Therefore, BD\u00b2 can approach 480, but cannot actually reach it.\n\nSo, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, but it's not achieved. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be 480, because BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but never less than 480.\n\nWait, but no, hold on. Wait, if BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above, meaning BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as desired but is always greater than 480, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, since BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480. So, 480 is the infimum.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that would be 480, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480, but can be as close to 480 as we like. Therefore, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my reasoning.\n\nWe found that BD\u00b2 = 480*(6u +5)/(36u -25), where u = sin\u00b2\u03b8 \u226525/36.\n\nWe saw that f(u) is decreasing on u \u226525/36, so as u increases, f(u) decreases.\n\nBut u can't reach 1, because that would put point A at infinity. So, u approaches 1 from below, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480*(6*1 +5)/(36*1 -25) = 480*11/11 = 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480.\n\nTherefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because if BD\u00b2 approaches 480, then for any number less than 480, say 480 - \u03b5, we can find a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than 480 - \u03b5? No, wait, no. Because as u approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, so 480 is the lower bound. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 from above, then 480 is the infimum. So, for any m <480, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 < m is not true, because BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired. So, the problem is asking for the greatest number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, m must be less than or equal to 480. But since BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as we like, m cannot be greater than 480. So, the greatest such m is 480.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory because 480 is the infimum, so for any m <480, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than m. Wait, no, because BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above, meaning BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480. So, for any m <480, BD\u00b2 is always greater than m, so m can be as close to 480 as we like, but m must be less than 480.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it this way: For the problem, we need the greatest number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, m must be less than or equal to the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 480. But since BD\u00b2 can approach 480, the greatest m is 480, because m must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but since BD\u00b2 can be as close to 480 as desired, the only m that satisfies m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is m \u2264480. But the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, then 480 is the infimum. So, for any number greater than 480, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than that number. But for numbers less than 480, BD\u00b2 is always greater than that number. So, the greatest number m that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because 480 is the infimum, meaning BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as we want, but is always greater than or equal to 480. So, m must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, m must be less than or equal to 480. But since BD\u00b2 can be as close to 480 as we like, the greatest m is 480.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, so 480 is the lower bound. So, 480 is the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose m is 480. Then, m < BD\u00b2 is 480 < BD\u00b2. But BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480? No, because when u approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, so 480 is the infimum. So, m can be 480, since for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 >480, so 480 < BD\u00b2. Therefore, 480 is the greatest such number.\n\nWait, but earlier, when u approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, but never actually reaches it. So, technically, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480. So, 480 is the infimum, but it's not attained. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\nBut let me check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Points A and B on hyperbola.\n\n2. Diagonals intersect at origin, so points are symmetric.\n\n3. Derived condition px + qy =0.\n\n4. Expressed points in terms of hyperbolic functions.\n\n5.

So, the answer is 480.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{480}\n\n\nGiven the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\), we need to find the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all rhombi \\(ABCD\\) whose diagonals intersect at the origin.\n\n1. **Points on Hyperbola**: Points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) lie on the hyperbola.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. The question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I need to find the supremum of BD\u00b2, but not necessarily the maximum, since it might not be attainable.\n\nFirst, let's recall some properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, they bisect each other but not necessarily at right angles unless it's a square. Hmm, no, wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular. Wait, no, wait, I think I confused that with a kite. Let me think again.\n\nNo, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square, which is a special case. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me check: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Yes, that's correct. So, the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, the diagonals intersect at 90 degrees, and each diagonal is cut into two equal parts by the other.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD.\n\nSo, if points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, then the coordinates of these points must satisfy certain symmetries.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of the points. Let's say point A is (x, y), then because the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, point C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D would be symmetric with respect to the origin as well. So, if point B is (u, v), then point D would be (-u, -v).\n\nSo, the four points are A(x, y), B(u, v), C(-x, -y), D(-u, -v).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, which must equal the distance between C and D, and so on.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the properties of the rhombus and the hyperbola.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, and the points lie on the hyperbola, maybe we can parametrize the points.\n\nLet me think about the diagonals. The diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD. Since they intersect at the origin, they are straight lines passing through the origin. So, the diagonals lie along certain lines through the origin.\n\nMoreover, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, if AC has a slope m, then BD must have a slope of -1/m.\n\nAlternatively, if AC is along a line making an angle \u03b8 with the x-axis, then BD would be along \u03b8 + 90 degrees.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parametrize the points A and C along one line through the origin, and points B and D along another line perpendicular to the first.\n\nBut since all four points lie on the hyperbola, we can write down their coordinates accordingly.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nSuppose that the diagonal AC lies along a line through the origin with slope m. Then, points A and C can be represented parametrically as (t, mt) and (-t, -mt) for some parameter t.\n\nSimilarly, since BD is perpendicular to AC, its slope would be -1/m, so points B and D can be represented as (s, (-1/m)s) and (-s, (1/m)s) for some parameter s.\n\nSince A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, let's substitute these coordinates into the equation.\n\nFirst, for point A(t, mt):\n\nt\u00b2/20 - (mt)\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSimilarly, for point B(s, (-1/m)s):\n\ns\u00b2/20 - [(-1/m)s]^2 /24 = 1\n\nLet me compute these equations.\n\nFor point A:\n\nt\u00b2/20 - (m\u00b2 t\u00b2)/24 = 1\n\nFactor t\u00b2:\n\nt\u00b2 (1/20 - m\u00b2/24) = 1\n\nSimilarly, for point B:\n\ns\u00b2/20 - ( (1/m\u00b2) s\u00b2 ) /24 = 1\n\nFactor s\u00b2:\n\ns\u00b2 (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)) = 1\n\nSo, for both points, their parameters t and s must satisfy similar equations, but with different coefficients.\n\nLet me denote the coefficient for t\u00b2 as K_A = 1/20 - m\u00b2/24\n\nAnd the coefficient for s\u00b2 as K_B = 1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)\n\nSo, t\u00b2 = 1 / K_A\n\ns\u00b2 = 1 / K_B\n\nBut since t and s are real numbers, the denominators must be positive; otherwise, we would have complex numbers, which are not allowed here.\n\nSo, we require that K_A > 0 and K_B > 0.\n\nSo,\n\n1/20 - m\u00b2/24 > 0 \u2192 m\u00b2 < 24/20 = 6/5 = 1.2\n\nSimilarly,\n\n1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2) > 0 \u2192 1/(24 m\u00b2) < 1/20 \u2192 24 m\u00b2 > 20 \u2192 m\u00b2 > 20/24 = 5/6 \u2248 0.8333\n\nSo, m\u00b2 must satisfy 5/6 < m\u00b2 < 6/5.\n\nSo, the slope m must satisfy sqrt(5/6) < |m| < sqrt(6/5).\n\nOkay, that gives us constraints on m.\n\nNow, since the four points form a rhombus, the sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, etc.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think in terms of vectors. Let me consider the vectors OA and OB.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, the vectors OA and OB must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nWait, let me think about the vectors. The sides AB, BC, CD, DA are all equal.\n\nAlternatively, in terms of vectors, the vectors AB and AD should have the same magnitude.\n\nBut perhaps using coordinates is better.\n\nLet me compute the distance AB squared.\n\nPoint A is (t, mt), point B is (s, (-1/m)s).\n\nSo, the distance squared between A and B is:\n\n(t - s)^2 + (mt - (-s/m))^2.\n\nSimilarly, since all sides are equal, the distance squared AB should equal the distance squared BC, and so on.\n\nBut maybe instead of computing all sides, I can use the properties of the rhombus.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.\n\nBut since AC is from (t, mt) to (-t, -mt), the vector AC is (-2t, -2mt). Similarly, BD is from (s, (-1/m)s) to (-s, (1/m)s), so the vector BD is (-2s, (2/m)s).\n\nWait, let me check that: vector BD is D - B, which is (-s, (1/m)s) - (s, (-1/m)s) = (-2s, (2/m)s). So, vector BD is (-2s, (2/m)s).\n\nSimilarly, vector AC is C - A = (-t - t, -mt - mt) = (-2t, -2mt).\n\nThese two vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular, so their dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, (-2t)(-2s) + (-2mt)(2s/m) = 0.\n\nCompute this:\n\n(4ts) + (-4ts) = 0\n\nSo, 4ts - 4ts = 0 \u2192 0 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's always true, regardless of t and s. So, the diagonals are always perpendicular, which is consistent with the properties of a rhombus.\n\nBut we also need to ensure that all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C.\n\nWait, let's compute AB\u00b2 and BC\u00b2.\n\nAB\u00b2: (t - s)^2 + (mt - (-s/m))^2.\n\nBC\u00b2: (s - (-t))^2 + [ (-s/m) - (-mt) ]^2.\n\nWait, point B is (s, (-1/m)s), point C is (-t, -mt). So, vector BC is (-t - s, -mt - (-s/m)).\n\nSo, BC squared is (-t - s)^2 + (-mt + s/m)^2.\n\nSimilarly, AB squared is (t - s)^2 + (mt + s/m)^2.\n\nSo, since AB = BC, their squares must be equal.\n\nSo, set AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2:\n\n(t - s)^2 + (mt + s/m)^2 = (-t - s)^2 + (-mt + s/m)^2.\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side:\n\n(t - s)^2 = t\u00b2 - 2ts + s\u00b2\n\n(mt + s/m)^2 = m\u00b2 t\u00b2 + 2t s + (s\u00b2)/(m\u00b2)\n\nSo, left side total:\n\nt\u00b2 - 2ts + s\u00b2 + m\u00b2 t\u00b2 + 2ts + s\u00b2/m\u00b2\n\n= t\u00b2 + m\u00b2 t\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + s\u00b2/m\u00b2 + (-2ts + 2ts)\n\nSimplify: (1 + m\u00b2) t\u00b2 + (1 + 1/m\u00b2) s\u00b2\n\nRight side:\n\n(-t - s)^2 = t\u00b2 + 2ts + s\u00b2\n\n(-mt + s/m)^2 = m\u00b2 t\u00b2 - 2t s + (s\u00b2)/(m\u00b2)\n\nSo, right side total:\n\nt\u00b2 + 2ts + s\u00b2 + m\u00b2 t\u00b2 - 2ts + s\u00b2/m\u00b2\n\n= t\u00b2 + m\u00b2 t\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + s\u00b2/m\u00b2 + (2ts - 2ts)\n\nSimplify: (1 + m\u00b2) t\u00b2 + (1 + 1/m\u00b2) s\u00b2\n\nWait, so both sides are equal: (1 + m\u00b2) t\u00b2 + (1 + 1/m\u00b2) s\u00b2 = same thing.\n\nSo, AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2 is automatically satisfied.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, perhaps the condition that ABCD is a rhombus is satisfied as long as points A, B, C, D are as defined, given that the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other.\n\nWait, but that seems too easy. Maybe I'm missing another condition. Because in a rhombus, not only are the sides equal, but also the adjacent sides are equal. But since we've already ensured that the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, maybe that's enough to guarantee that all sides are equal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key condition is that the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, and in that case, the figure is a rhombus.\n\nWait, I think that's correct. Because if the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other and are perpendicular, then the quadrilateral is a rhombus.\n\nYes, that's a theorem. So, perhaps in this problem, given that the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, the quadrilateral is a rhombus.\n\nSo, perhaps the only condition we need is that the diagonals are perpendicular, which is given, and that the points lie on the hyperbola.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the rhombus is uniquely determined by the slopes of the diagonals, which are m and -1/m.\n\nSo, moving forward with that, the next step is to find BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, BD is the other diagonal, from point B(s, (-1/m)s) to point D(-s, (1/m)s). So, BD is a vector of length sqrt[ (-s - s)^2 + ( (1/m)s - (-1/m)s )^2 ].\n\nWait, BD is the distance between B and D. Wait, no: BD is the diagonal, so it's the distance between B and D.\n\nWait, no, BD is the diagonal, which is from B to D. But since the diagonals intersect at the origin, BD is a line passing through the origin, so BD is twice the distance from the origin to either B or D.\n\nWait, no, BD is the entire diagonal, so its length is the distance between B and D, which is sqrt[ (s - (-s))\u00b2 + ( (-1/m)s - (1/m)s )\u00b2 ].\n\nSo, BD squared is [2s]^2 + [ (-2/m)s ]^2 = 4s\u00b2 + (4/m\u00b2) s\u00b2 = 4s\u00b2 (1 + 1/m\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, AC squared is [2t]^2 + [2mt]^2 = 4t\u00b2 + 4m\u00b2 t\u00b2 = 4t\u00b2 (1 + m\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 s\u00b2 (1 + 1/m\u00b2 )\n\nAnd AC\u00b2 = 4 t\u00b2 (1 + m\u00b2 )\n\nBut from earlier, we have expressions for t\u00b2 and s\u00b2 in terms of m.\n\nFrom point A: t\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - m\u00b2/24 )\n\nSimilarly, from point B: s\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2) )\n\nSo, let's compute BD\u00b2.\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 s\u00b2 (1 + 1/m\u00b2 )\n\n= 4 * [1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)) ] * (1 + 1/m\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, let's compute AC\u00b2, just for completeness.\n\nAC\u00b2 = 4 t\u00b2 (1 + m\u00b2 )\n\n= 4 * [1 / (1/20 - m\u00b2 /24 ) ] * (1 + m\u00b2 )\n\nBut the problem is asking about BD\u00b2, so let's focus on that.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 * [1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)) ] * (1 + 1/m\u00b2 )\n\nLet me simplify this expression.\n\nLet me denote m\u00b2 as k for simplicity.\n\nSo, let k = m\u00b2. Then, since earlier we found that k must be between 5/6 and 6/5, so 5/6 < k < 6/5.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 becomes:\n\n4 * [1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 k)) ] * (1 + 1/k )\n\nLet me compute the denominator first: 1/20 - 1/(24k)\n\n= (24k - 20)/(24k * 20 )\n\n= (24k - 20)/(480k )\n\nSo, 1 / (1/20 - 1/(24k)) = 480k / (24k - 20 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 becomes:\n\n4 * [480k / (24k - 20 ) ] * (1 + 1/k )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n4 * (480k) = 1920k\n\nDenominator: (24k - 20 )\n\nMultiply by (1 + 1/k ) = (k + 1)/k\n\nSo, overall:\n\nBD\u00b2 = [1920k * (k + 1)/k ] / (24k - 20 )\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n1920k * (k + 1)/k = 1920 (k + 1 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = [1920 (k + 1 ) ] / (24k - 20 )\n\nWe can factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 1920(k + 1 )\n\nDenominator: 24k - 20 = 4*(6k - 5 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = [1920 (k + 1) ] / [4 (6k -5 ) ]\n\nSimplify 1920 / 4 = 480\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480 (k + 1 ) / (6k - 5 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480 (k + 1 ) / (6k - 5 )\n\nNow, we need to analyze this expression as a function of k, where 5/6 < k < 6/5.\n\nSo, let me write f(k) = 480 (k + 1 ) / (6k - 5 )\n\nWe need to find the supremum of f(k) over 5/6 < k < 6/5.\n\nWait, but since k is between 5/6 and 6/5, let's see what happens as k approaches these limits.\n\nFirst, when k approaches 5/6 from above:\n\nk = 5/6 + \u03b5, \u03b5 \u2192 0+\n\nThen, 6k -5 = 6*(5/6 + \u03b5 ) -5 = 5 + 6\u03b5 -5 = 6\u03b5 \u2192 0+\n\nSo, denominator approaches 0 from positive side.\n\nNumerator: k + 1 approaches 5/6 + 1 = 11/6.\n\nSo, f(k) approaches 480*(11/6) / (approaching 0+) \u2192 +infinity.\n\nSimilarly, when k approaches 6/5 from below:\n\nk = 6/5 - \u03b5, \u03b5 \u2192 0+\n\nThen, 6k -5 = 6*(6/5 - \u03b5 ) -5 = (36/5 -6 \u03b5 ) -5 = (36/5 -25/5 ) -6 \u03b5 = 11/5 -6 \u03b5 \u2192 11/5 as \u03b5 \u21920.\n\nSo, denominator approaches 11/5.\n\nNumerator: k +1 approaches 6/5 +1 = 11/5.\n\nSo, f(k) approaches 480*(11/5 ) / (11/5 ) = 480.\n\nSo, as k approaches 6/5 from below, f(k) approaches 480.\n\nWait, but earlier, when k approaches 5/6 from above, f(k) approaches infinity. But that's impossible because k is bounded between 5/6 and 6/5, so as k approaches 5/6+, f(k) tends to infinity.\n\nBut wait, that can't be correct because when k approaches 5/6+, the denominator approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 tends to infinity. But the hyperbola is fixed; BD\u00b2 can't be arbitrarily large.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, when k approaches 5/6+, what happens to points B and D?\n\nFrom point B, s\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - 1/(24k)).\n\nAs k approaches 5/6+, 1/(24k) approaches 1/(24*(5/6)) = 1/(20) = 0.05.\n\nSo, 1/20 - 1/(24k) approaches 1/20 - 1/20 = 0.\n\nSo, s\u00b2 approaches 1/0 \u2192 infinity.\n\nSo, s approaches infinity, which would make BD\u00b2 = 4 s\u00b2 (1 + 1/m\u00b2 ) approach infinity as well.\n\nBut the hyperbola is unbounded, so in theory, BD\u00b2 can be made as large as desired by taking points B and D very far out on the hyperbola.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the supremum would be infinity? But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a finite number.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read it.\n\n\"Let A, B, C, D be points on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 such that ABCD is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nWait, so BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, but we are to find the greatest lower bound? No, the wording is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, no, it says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of BD\u00b2, but not necessarily attainable. Wait, but if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, then the supremum is infinity, but that can't be, as the problem expects a finite answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps BD\u00b2 has a lower bound but no upper bound, but the question is about the supremum, which would be infinity. But the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the conditions. Maybe BD\u00b2 cannot be made arbitrarily large because of the constraints on the hyperbola and the rhombus.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that as k approaches 5/6 from above, BD\u00b2 tends to infinity, but maybe in reality, there's another constraint that prevents BD\u00b2 from being too large.\n\nWait, let me think again. The points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. So, as k approaches 5/6 from above, the denominator 6k -5 approaches zero, making BD\u00b2 go to infinity. But perhaps the hyperbola doesn't allow for such a configuration because the points would have to be arranged in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rhombus cannot have BD\u00b2 approaching infinity because the hyperbola is fixed.\n\nWait, but the hyperbola extends to infinity, so perhaps BD can be made as long as desired, making BD\u00b2 as large as desired. So, the supremum would be infinity. But the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, then there is no such greatest real number; it would be unbounded.\n\nBut the problem is presented as a math competition problem, which typically has a finite answer. So, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me retrace my steps.\n\nI assumed that the diagonals are perpendicular, which they are in a rhombus, and that the diagonals intersect at the origin. So, points A, C are (t, mt) and (-t, -mt); points B, D are (s, (-1/m)s) and (-s, (1/m)s).\n\nThen, substituting into the hyperbola equation, I found expressions for t\u00b2 and s\u00b2 in terms of m\u00b2 =k.\n\nThen, I derived BD\u00b2 = 480(k +1)/(6k -5 )\n\nBut as k approaches 5/6 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity, but in reality, the hyperbola only allows certain points.\n\nWait, but on the hyperbola, points can be as far out as desired, so BD\u00b2 can indeed be made as large as desired, so the supremum is infinity. But the problem is asking for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nWait, that would mean that BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, so any real number would be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But that doesn't make sense because the question is about a specific number.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the other diagonal, AC\u00b2, that can be made arbitrarily large, while BD\u00b2 is constrained. Let me see.\n\nWait, AC\u00b2 = 4 t\u00b2 (1 + m\u00b2 )\n\nAnd t\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - m\u00b2/24 )\n\nSo, AC\u00b2 = 4 / (1/20 - m\u00b2/24 ) * (1 + m\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, as m\u00b2 approaches 6/5 from below, 1/20 - m\u00b2/24 approaches 1/20 - (6/5)/24 = 1/20 - (6)/(120) = 1/20 - 1/20 = 0.\n\nSo, AC\u00b2 approaches infinity as m\u00b2 approaches 6/5 from below.\n\nSimilarly, as m\u00b2 approaches 5/6 from above, 1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2 ) approaches 1/20 - (1)/(24*(5/6)) = 1/20 - (1)/(20) = 0, so s\u00b2 approaches infinity, making BD\u00b2 approach infinity.\n\nSo, both diagonals can be made as large as desired, so both BD\u00b2 and AC\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, making their supremum infinity.\n\nBut the problem is specifically asking about BD\u00b2. So, perhaps I'm missing some constraint.\n\nWait, perhaps the rhombus must have its vertices on the hyperbola, but the hyperbola has two branches. If all four points are on the same branch, the rhombus might not be possible because the points would have to be on opposite branches.\n\nWait, in the hyperbola equation, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, the hyperbola has two branches, one on the right (x>0) and one on the left (x<0). So, if points A and C are on opposite branches, then points B and D would also be on opposite branches.\n\nBut in the parametrization I used earlier, points A and C are on the same line through the origin, so if A is on the right branch, C is on the left, and similarly, points B and D are on the right and left branches.\n\nSo, that's acceptable.\n\nWait, but perhaps the rhombus cannot have all four points on the same branch because the diagonals would have to cross, but the hyperbola doesn't allow for that. So, all rhombuses must have points on both branches.\n\nBut that doesn't affect the possibility of BD\u00b2 being made arbitrarily large.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rhombus cannot be \"too large\" because the hyperbola's asymptotes constrain the possible slopes.\n\nWait, the hyperbola has asymptotes y = \u00b1sqrt(24/20) x = \u00b1sqrt(6/5) x \u2248 \u00b11.0954 x.\n\nSo, the slopes of the diagonals AC and BD must satisfy certain conditions. Since AC has slope m, and BD has slope -1/m, we must have that |m| and |1/m| are less than or equal to sqrt(6/5), because the asymptotes are the limiting slopes.\n\nWait, but earlier we found that m\u00b2 must be between 5/6 and 6/5, so |m| is between sqrt(5/6) \u22480.9129 and sqrt(6/5)\u22481.0954.\n\nSo, the slopes of the diagonals are constrained between approximately \u00b10.9129 and \u00b11.0954.\n\nSo, the slopes can't be too steep or too shallow.\n\nBut does this affect BD\u00b2? Because as m approaches sqrt(5/6) from above, BD\u00b2 tends to infinity, but m is bounded below by sqrt(5/6), so approaching that limit would make BD\u00b2 go to infinity.\n\nWait, but in reality, the hyperbola's asymptotes are y = \u00b1sqrt(6/5) x, so the lines along which BD lies would have slopes of \u00b1sqrt(5/6) or \u00b1sqrt(6/5). Wait, no, the lines BD have slopes -1/m, so if m approaches sqrt(5/6), then -1/m approaches -sqrt(6/5), which is within the asymptote slopes.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that imposes any further constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the points B and D lie on the hyperbola and the line through them has slope -1/m.\n\nSo, for the line y = (-1/m)x to intersect the hyperbola, the points B and D must lie on both the line and the hyperbola.\n\nThe intersection points can be found by substituting y = (-1/m)x into the hyperbola equation.\n\nSo, x\u00b2/20 - [ (-1/m x )\u00b2 ] /24 = 1.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 m\u00b2 ) =1\n\nx\u00b2 (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2 )) =1\n\nWhich is exactly the equation we had earlier, leading to x\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2 )).\n\nSo, as long as 1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2 ) >0, which is equivalent to m\u00b2 >5/6, which is already our condition.\n\nSo, as m approaches sqrt(5/6) from above, the x\u00b2 approaches infinity, meaning points B and D go to infinity along the line y = (-1/m)x.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2, which is proportional to s\u00b2, also approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, meaning there is no upper bound. So, the supremum is infinity, but the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be made as large as desired, then the set of BD\u00b2 is unbounded above. Therefore, any real number would be less than BD\u00b2 for sufficiently large BD\u00b2. So, the problem must be interpreted differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, not the supremum. Because if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, then the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be negative infinity, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the greatest lower bound of BD\u00b2, i.e., the infimum. Let me check the wording again.\n\n\"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nHmm, that wording is a bit ambiguous. It could be interpreted as the supremum of the lower bounds, which would be the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the maximum lower bound, meaning the infimum.\n\nWait, if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, but perhaps it has a minimum value. So, the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because BD\u00b2 can't be smaller than that.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the minimum possible BD\u00b2.\n\nLet me think. So, if BD\u00b2 can be made as large as desired, but perhaps has a minimum value, then the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be that minimum BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, perhaps I should find the minimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, let's go back to BD\u00b2 = 480(k +1 ) / (6k -5 ), where 5/6 <k <6/5.\n\nWe can treat BD\u00b2 as a function f(k) = 480(k +1 ) / (6k -5 ), and find its minimum over the interval 5/6 <k <6/5.\n\nTo find the minimum, we can take the derivative of f(k) with respect to k, set it to zero, and find critical points.\n\nSo, let's compute f(k):\n\nf(k) = 480(k +1 ) / (6k -5 )\n\nCompute f'(k):\n\nUsing the quotient rule: f'(k) = [480*(6k -5 ) - 480(k +1 )*6 ] / (6k -5 )\u00b2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n480*(6k -5 ) - 480*6*(k +1 )\n\nFactor 480:\n\n480 [ (6k -5 ) -6(k +1 ) ]\n\n=480 [6k -5 -6k -6 ]\n\n=480 [ -11 ]\n\nSo, f'(k) = (-5280 ) / (6k -5 )\u00b2\n\nSince (6k -5 )\u00b2 is always positive for k >5/6, the derivative f'(k) is always negative.\n\nTherefore, f(k) is strictly decreasing on the interval 5/6 <k <6/5.\n\nSo, the function f(k) decreases as k increases.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of f(k) occurs at the right endpoint of the interval, which is k approaching 6/5 from below.\n\nAs k approaches 6/5, f(k) approaches 480*(6/5 +1 ) / (6*(6/5 ) -5 )\n\nCompute numerator: 6/5 +1 = 11/5\n\nDenominator: 36/5 -25/5 =11/5\n\nSo, f(k) approaches 480*(11/5 ) / (11/5 ) =480.\n\nSimilarly, as k approaches 5/6 from above, f(k) approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, since f(k) is strictly decreasing, the minimum value of BD\u00b2 is 480, approached as k approaches 6/5.\n\nBut wait, as k approaches 6/5, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, but does it actually attain 480?\n\nWait, when k =6/5, the denominator 6k -5 becomes 6*(6/5 ) -5 =36/5 -25/5=11/5, which is positive, but in our earlier condition, k must be less than 6/5. So, k approaches 6/5 from below, so f(k) approaches 480 from above.\n\nWait, but f(k) is decreasing, so as k increases, f(k) decreases. So, the minimal value is 480, but it's not attained; it's a limit as k approaches 6/5 from below.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but never less than 480.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier statement that as k approaches 6/5, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nWait, no, actually, f(k) is decreasing, so as k increases, f(k) decreases. So, the minimal value is approached as k approaches 6/5, but since k cannot reach 6/5, BD\u00b2 cannot reach 480, but can get arbitrarily close to it from above.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, and can be made as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480.\n\nSo, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, but it's not attained.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, but can be made arbitrarily close to 480.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, if BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, then 480 is the greatest lower bound. Therefore, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nSince BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as k approaches 6/5 from below, and for all other k in (5/6, 6/5), BD\u00b2 is greater than 480, then 480 is indeed the infimum, and the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier computation.\n\nEarlier, I had BD\u00b2 = 480(k +1 )/(6k -5 )\n\nAs k approaches 6/5, let's compute:\n\nk=6/5, then 6k=36/5, 36/5 -5=36/5 -25/5=11/5\n\nk+1=6/5 +5/5=11/5\n\nSo, (k+1)/(6k -5 )= (11/5)/(11/5 )=1\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480*1=480.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, approached as k approaches 6/5.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. The question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I need to find the supremum of BD\u00b2, but not necessarily the maximum, since it might not be attainable.\n\nFirst, let's recall some properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, they bisect each other but not necessarily at right angles unless it's a square. Hmm, no, wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular. Wait, no, wait, I think I confused that with a kite. Let me think again.\n\nNo, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square, which is a special case. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me check: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Yes, that's correct. So, the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, the diagonals intersect at 90 degrees, and each diagonal is cut into two equal parts by the other.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD.\n\nSo, if points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, then the coordinates of these points must satisfy certain symmetries.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of the points. Let's say point A is (x, y), then because the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, point C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D would be symmetric with respect to the origin as well. So, if point B is (u, v), then point D would be (-u, -v).\n\nSo, the four points are A(x, y), B(u, v), C(-x, -y), D(-u, -v).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, which must equal the distance between C and D, and so on.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the properties of the rhombus and the hyperbola.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, and the points lie on the hyperbola, maybe we can parametrize the points.\n\nLet me think about the diagonals. The diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD. Since they intersect at the origin, they are straight lines passing through the origin. So, the diagonals lie along certain lines through the origin.\n\nMoreover, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, if AC has a slope m, then BD must have a slope of -1/m.\n\nAlternatively, if AC is along a line making an angle \u03b8 with the x-axis, then BD would be along \u03b8 + 90 degrees.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parametrize the points A and C along one line through the origin, and points B and D along another line perpendicular to the first.\n\nBut since all four points lie on the hyperbola, we can write down their coordinates accordingly.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nSuppose that the diagonal AC lies along a line through the origin with slope m. Then, points A and C can be represented parametrically as (t, mt) and (-t, -mt) for some parameter t.\n\nSimilarly, since BD is perpendicular to AC, its slope would be -1/m, so points B and D can be represented as (s, (-1/m)s) and (-s, (1/m)s) for some parameter s.\n\nSince A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, let's substitute these coordinates into the equation.\n\nFirst, for point A(t, mt):\n\nt\u00b2/20 - (mt)\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSimilarly, for point B(s, (-1/m)s):\n\ns\u00b2/20 - [(-1/m)s]^2 /24 = 1\n\nLet me compute these equations.\n\nFor point A:\n\nt\u00b2/20 - (m\u00b2 t\u00b2)/24 = 1\n\nFactor t\u00b2:\n\nt\u00b2 (1/20 - m\u00b2/24) = 1\n\nSimilarly, for point B:\n\ns\u00b2/20 - ( (1/m\u00b2) s\u00b2 ) /24 = 1\n\nFactor s\u00b2:\n\ns\u00b2 (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)) = 1\n\nSo, for both points, their parameters t and s must satisfy similar equations, but with different coefficients.\n\nLet me denote the coefficient for t\u00b2 as K_A = 1/20 - m\u00b2/24\n\nAnd the coefficient for s\u00b2 as K_B = 1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)\n\nSo, t\u00b2 = 1 / K_A\n\ns\u00b2 = 1 / K_B\n\nBut since t and s are real numbers, the denominators must be positive; otherwise, we would have complex numbers, which are not allowed here.\n\nSo, we require that K_A > 0 and K_B > 0.\n\nSo,\n\n1/20 - m\u00b2/24 > 0 \u2192 m\u00b2 < 24/20 = 6/5 = 1.2\n\nSimilarly,\n\n1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2) > 0 \u2192 1/(24 m\u00b2) < 1/20 \u2192 24 m\u00b2 > 20 \u2192 m\u00b2 > 20/24 = 5/6 \u2248 0.8333\n\nSo, m\u00b2 must satisfy 5/6 < m\u00b2 < 6/5.\n\nSo, the slope m must satisfy sqrt(5/6) < |m| < sqrt(6/5).\n\nOkay, that gives us constraints on m.\n\nNow, since the four points form a rhombus, the sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, etc.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think in terms of vectors. Let me consider the vectors OA and OB.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, the vectors OA and OB must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nWait, let me think about the vectors. The sides AB, BC, CD, DA are all equal.\n\nAlternatively, in terms of vectors, the vectors AB and AD should have the same magnitude.\n\nBut perhaps using coordinates is better.\n\nLet me compute the distance AB squared.\n\nPoint A is (t, mt), point B is (s, (-1/m)s).\n\nSo, the distance squared between A and B is:\n\n(t - s)^2 + (mt - (-s/m))^2.\n\nSimilarly, since all sides are equal, the distance squared AB should equal the distance squared BC, and so on.\n\nBut maybe instead of computing all sides, I can use the properties of the rhombus.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.\n\nBut since AC is from (t, mt) to (-t, -mt), the vector AC is (-2t, -2mt). Similarly, BD is from (s, (-1/m)s) to (-s, (1/m)s), so the vector BD is (-2s, (2/m)s).\n\nWait, let me check that: vector BD is D - B, which is (-s, (1/m)s) - (s, (-1/m)s) = (-2s, (2/m)s). So, vector BD is (-2s, (2/m)s).\n\nSimilarly, vector AC is C - A = (-t - t, -mt - mt) = (-2t, -2mt).\n\nThese two vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular, so their dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, (-2t)(-2s) + (-2mt)(2s/m) = 0.\n\nCompute this:\n\n(4ts) + (-4ts) = 0\n\nSo, 4ts - 4ts = 0 \u2192 0 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's always true, regardless of t and s. So, the diagonals are always perpendicular, which is consistent with the properties of a rhombus.\n\nBut we also need to ensure that all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C.\n\nWait, let's compute AB\u00b2 and BC\u00b2.\n\nAB\u00b2: (t - s)^2 + (mt - (-s/m))^2.\n\nBC\u00b2: (s - (-t))^2 + [ (-s/m) - (-mt) ]^2.\n\nWait, point B is (s, (-1/m)s), point C is (-t, -mt). So, vector BC is (-t - s, -mt - (-s/m)).\n\nSo, BC squared is (-t - s)^2 + (-mt + s/m)^2.\n\nSimilarly, AB squared is (t - s)^2 + (mt + s/m)^2.\n\nSo, since AB = BC, their squares must be equal.\n\nSo, set AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2:\n\n(t - s)^2 + (mt + s/m)^2 = (-t - s)^2 + (-mt + s/m)^2.\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side:\n\n(t - s)^2 = t\u00b2 - 2ts + s\u00b2\n\n(mt + s/m)^2 = m\u00b2 t\u00b2 + 2t s + (s\u00b2)/(m\u00b2)\n\nSo, left side total:\n\nt\u00b2 - 2ts + s\u00b2 + m\u00b2 t\u00b2 + 2ts + s\u00b2/m\u00b2\n\n= t\u00b2 + m\u00b2 t\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + s\u00b2/m\u00b2 + (-2ts + 2ts)\n\nSimplify: (1 + m\u00b2) t\u00b2 + (1 + 1/m\u00b2) s\u00b2\n\nRight side:\n\n(-t - s)^2 = t\u00b2 + 2ts + s\u00b2\n\n(-mt + s/m)^2 = m\u00b2 t\u00b2 - 2t s + (s\u00b2)/(m\u00b2)\n\nSo, right side total:\n\nt\u00b2 + 2ts + s\u00b2 + m\u00b2 t\u00b2 - 2ts + s\u00b2/m\u00b2\n\n= t\u00b2 + m\u00b2 t\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + s\u00b2/m\u00b2 + (2ts - 2ts)\n\nSimplify: (1 + m\u00b2) t\u00b2 + (1 + 1/m\u00b2) s\u00b2\n\nWait, so both sides are equal: (1 + m\u00b2) t\u00b2 + (1 + 1/m\u00b2) s\u00b2 = same thing.\n\nSo, AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2 is automatically satisfied.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, perhaps the condition that ABCD is a rhombus is satisfied as long as points A, B, C, D are as defined, given that the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other.\n\nWait, but that seems too easy. Maybe I'm missing another condition. Because in a rhombus, not only are the sides equal, but also the adjacent sides are equal. But since we've already ensured that the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, maybe that's enough to guarantee that all sides are equal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key condition is that the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, and in that case, the figure is a rhombus.\n\nWait, I think that's correct. Because if the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other and are perpendicular, then the quadrilateral is a rhombus.\n\nYes, that's a theorem. So, perhaps in this problem, given that the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, the quadrilateral is a rhombus.\n\nSo, perhaps the only condition we need is that the diagonals are perpendicular, which is given, and that the points lie on the hyperbola.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the rhombus is uniquely determined by the slopes of the diagonals, which are m and -1/m.\n\nSo, moving forward with that, the next step is to find BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, BD is the other diagonal, from point B(s, (-1/m)s) to point D(-s, (1/m)s). So, BD is a vector of length sqrt[ (-s - s)^2 + ( (1/m)s - (-1/m)s )^2 ].\n\nWait, BD is the distance between B and D. Wait, no: BD is the diagonal, so it's the distance between B and D.\n\nWait, no, BD is the diagonal, which is from B to D. But since the diagonals intersect at the origin, BD is a line passing through the origin, so BD is twice the distance from the origin to either B or D.\n\nWait, no, BD is the entire diagonal, so its length is the distance between B and D, which is sqrt[ (s - (-s))\u00b2 + ( (-1/m)s - (1/m)s )\u00b2 ].\n\nSo, BD squared is [2s]^2 + [ (-2/m)s ]^2 = 4s\u00b2 + (4/m\u00b2) s\u00b2 = 4s\u00b2 (1 + 1/m\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, AC squared is [2t]^2 + [2mt]^2 = 4t\u00b2 + 4m\u00b2 t\u00b2 = 4t\u00b2 (1 + m\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 s\u00b2 (1 + 1/m\u00b2 )\n\nAnd AC\u00b2 = 4 t\u00b2 (1 + m\u00b2 )\n\nBut from earlier, we have expressions for t\u00b2 and s\u00b2 in terms of m.\n\nFrom point A: t\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - m\u00b2/24 )\n\nSimilarly, from point B: s\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2) )\n\nSo, let's compute BD\u00b2.\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 s\u00b2 (1 + 1/m\u00b2 )\n\n= 4 * [1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)) ] * (1 + 1/m\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, let's compute AC\u00b2, just for completeness.\n\nAC\u00b2 = 4 t\u00b2 (1 + m\u00b2 )\n\n= 4 * [1 / (1/20 - m\u00b2 /24 ) ] * (1 + m\u00b2 )\n\nBut the problem is asking about BD\u00b2, so let's focus on that.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 * [1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)) ] * (1 + 1/m\u00b2 )\n\nLet me simplify this expression.\n\nLet me denote m\u00b2 as k for simplicity.\n\nSo, let k = m\u00b2. Then, since earlier we found that k must be between 5/6 and 6/5, so 5/6 < k < 6/5.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 becomes:\n\n4 * [1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 k)) ] * (1 + 1/k )\n\nLet me compute the denominator first: 1/20 - 1/(24k)\n\n= (24k - 20)/(24k * 20 )\n\n= (24k - 20)/(480k )\n\nSo, 1 / (1/20 - 1/(24k)) = 480k / (24k - 20 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 becomes:\n\n4 * [480k / (24k - 20 ) ] * (1 + 1/k )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n4 * (480k) = 1920k\n\nDenominator: (24k - 20 )\n\nMultiply by (1 + 1/k ) = (k + 1)/k\n\nSo, overall:\n\nBD\u00b2 = [1920k * (k + 1)/k ] / (24k - 20 )\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n1920k * (k + 1)/k = 1920 (k + 1 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = [1920 (k + 1 ) ] / (24k - 20 )\n\nWe can factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 1920(k + 1 )\n\nDenominator: 24k - 20 = 4*(6k - 5 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = [1920 (k + 1) ] / [4 (6k -5 ) ]\n\nSimplify 1920 / 4 = 480\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480 (k + 1 ) / (6k - 5 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480 (k + 1 ) / (6k - 5 )\n\nNow, we need to analyze this expression as a function of k, where 5/6 < k < 6/5.\n\nSo, let me write f(k) = 480 (k + 1 ) / (6k - 5 )\n\nWe need to find the supremum of f(k) over 5/6 < k < 6/5.\n\nWait, but since k is between 5/6 and 6/5, let's see what happens as k approaches these limits.\n\nFirst, when k approaches 5/6 from above:\n\nk = 5/6 + \u03b5, \u03b5 \u2192 0+\n\nThen, 6k -5 = 6*(5/6 + \u03b5 ) -5 = 5 + 6\u03b5 -5 = 6\u03b5 \u2192 0+\n\nSo, denominator approaches 0 from positive side.\n\nNumerator: k + 1 approaches 5/6 + 1 = 11/6.\n\nSo, f(k) approaches 480*(11/6) / (approaching 0+) \u2192 +infinity.\n\nSimilarly, when k approaches 6/5 from below:\n\nk = 6/5 - \u03b5, \u03b5 \u2192 0+\n\nThen, 6k -5 = 6*(6/5 - \u03b5 ) -5 = (36/5 -6 \u03b5 ) -5 = (36/5 -25/5 ) -6 \u03b5 = 11/5 -6 \u03b5 \u2192 11/5 as \u03b5 \u21920.\n\nSo, denominator approaches 11/5.\n\nNumerator: k +1 approaches 6/5 +1 = 11/5.\n\nSo, f(k) approaches 480*(11/5 ) / (11/5 ) = 480.\n\nSo, as k approaches 6/5 from below, f(k) approaches 480.\n\nWait, but earlier, when k approaches 5/6 from above, f(k) approaches infinity. But that's impossible because k is bounded between 5/6 and 6/5, so as k approaches 5/6+, f(k) tends to infinity.\n\nBut wait, that can't be correct because when k approaches 5/6+, the denominator approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 tends to infinity. But the hyperbola is fixed; BD\u00b2 can't be arbitrarily large.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, when k approaches 5/6+, what happens to points B and D?\n\nFrom point B, s\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - 1/(24k)).\n\nAs k approaches 5/6+, 1/(24k) approaches 1/(24*(5/6)) = 1/(20) = 0.05.\n\nSo, 1/20 - 1/(24k) approaches 1/20 - 1/20 = 0.\n\nSo, s\u00b2 approaches 1/0 \u2192 infinity.\n\nSo, s approaches infinity, which would make BD\u00b2 = 4 s\u00b2 (1 + 1/m\u00b2 ) approach infinity as well.\n\nBut the hyperbola is unbounded, so in theory, BD\u00b2 can be made as large as desired by taking points B and D very far out on the hyperbola.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the supremum would be infinity? But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a finite number.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read it.\n\n\"Let A, B, C, D be points on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 such that ABCD is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nWait, so BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, but we are to find the greatest lower bound? No, the wording is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, no, it says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of BD\u00b2, but not necessarily attainable. Wait, but if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, then the supremum is infinity, but that can't be, as the problem expects a finite answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps BD\u00b2 has a lower bound but no upper bound, but the question is about the supremum, which would be infinity. But the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the conditions. Maybe BD\u00b2 cannot be made arbitrarily large because of the constraints on the hyperbola and the rhombus.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that as k approaches 5/6 from above, BD\u00b2 tends to infinity, but maybe in reality, there's another constraint that prevents BD\u00b2 from being too large.\n\nWait, let me think again. The points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. So, as k approaches 5/6 from above, the denominator 6k -5 approaches zero, making BD\u00b2 go to infinity. But perhaps the hyperbola doesn't allow for such a configuration because the points would have to be arranged in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rhombus cannot have BD\u00b2 approaching infinity because the hyperbola is fixed.\n\nWait, but the hyperbola extends to infinity, so perhaps BD can be made as long as desired, making BD\u00b2 as large as desired. So, the supremum would be infinity. But the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, then there is no such greatest real number; it would be unbounded.\n\nBut the problem is presented as a math competition problem, which typically has a finite answer. So, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me retrace my steps.\n\nI assumed that the diagonals are perpendicular, which they are in a rhombus, and that the diagonals intersect at the origin. So, points A, C are (t, mt) and (-t, -mt); points B, D are (s, (-1/m)s) and (-s, (1/m)s).\n\nThen, substituting into the hyperbola equation, I found expressions for t\u00b2 and s\u00b2 in terms of m\u00b2 =k.\n\nThen, I derived BD\u00b2 = 480(k +1)/(6k -5 )\n\nBut as k approaches 5/6 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity, but in reality, the hyperbola only allows certain points.\n\nWait, but on the hyperbola, points can be as far out as desired, so BD\u00b2 can indeed be made as large as desired, so the supremum is infinity. But the problem is asking for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nWait, that would mean that BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, so any real number would be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But that doesn't make sense because the question is about a specific number.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the other diagonal, AC\u00b2, that can be made arbitrarily large, while BD\u00b2 is constrained. Let me see.\n\nWait, AC\u00b2 = 4 t\u00b2 (1 + m\u00b2 )\n\nAnd t\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - m\u00b2/24 )\n\nSo, AC\u00b2 = 4 / (1/20 - m\u00b2/24 ) * (1 + m\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, as m\u00b2 approaches 6/5 from below, 1/20 - m\u00b2/24 approaches 1/20 - (6/5)/24 = 1/20 - (6)/(120) = 1/20 - 1/20 = 0.\n\nSo, AC\u00b2 approaches infinity as m\u00b2 approaches 6/5 from below.\n\nSimilarly, as m\u00b2 approaches 5/6 from above, 1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2 ) approaches 1/20 - (1)/(24*(5/6)) = 1/20 - (1)/(20) = 0, so s\u00b2 approaches infinity, making BD\u00b2 approach infinity.\n\nSo, both diagonals can be made as large as desired, so both BD\u00b2 and AC\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, making their supremum infinity.\n\nBut the problem is specifically asking about BD\u00b2. So, perhaps I'm missing some constraint.\n\nWait, perhaps the rhombus must have its vertices on the hyperbola, but the hyperbola has two branches. If all four points are on the same branch, the rhombus might not be possible because the points would have to be on opposite branches.\n\nWait, in the hyperbola equation, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, the hyperbola has two branches, one on the right (x>0) and one on the left (x<0). So, if points A and C are on opposite branches, then points B and D would also be on opposite branches.\n\nBut in the parametrization I used earlier, points A and C are on the same line through the origin, so if A is on the right branch, C is on the left, and similarly, points B and D are on the right and left branches.\n\nSo, that's acceptable.\n\nWait, but perhaps the rhombus cannot have all four points on the same branch because the diagonals would have to cross, but the hyperbola doesn't allow for that. So, all rhombuses must have points on both branches.\n\nBut that doesn't affect the possibility of BD\u00b2 being made arbitrarily large.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rhombus cannot be \"too large\" because the hyperbola's asymptotes constrain the possible slopes.\n\nWait, the hyperbola has asymptotes y = \u00b1sqrt(24/20) x = \u00b1sqrt(6/5) x \u2248 \u00b11.0954 x.\n\nSo, the slopes of the diagonals AC and BD must satisfy certain conditions. Since AC has slope m, and BD has slope -1/m, we must have that |m| and |1/m| are less than or equal to sqrt(6/5), because the asymptotes are the limiting slopes.\n\nWait, but earlier we found that m\u00b2 must be between 5/6 and 6/5, so |m| is between sqrt(5/6) \u22480.9129 and sqrt(6/5)\u22481.0954.\n\nSo, the slopes of the diagonals are constrained between approximately \u00b10.9129 and \u00b11.0954.\n\nSo, the slopes can't be too steep or too shallow.\n\nBut does this affect BD\u00b2? Because as m approaches sqrt(5/6) from above, BD\u00b2 tends to infinity, but m is bounded below by sqrt(5/6), so approaching that limit would make BD\u00b2 go to infinity.\n\nWait, but in reality, the hyperbola's asymptotes are y = \u00b1sqrt(6/5) x, so the lines along which BD lies would have slopes of \u00b1sqrt(5/6) or \u00b1sqrt(6/5). Wait, no, the lines BD have slopes -1/m, so if m approaches sqrt(5/6), then -1/m approaches -sqrt(6/5), which is within the asymptote slopes.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that imposes any further constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the points B and D lie on the hyperbola and the line through them has slope -1/m.\n\nSo, for the line y = (-1/m)x to intersect the hyperbola, the points B and D must lie on both the line and the hyperbola.\n\nThe intersection points can be found by substituting y = (-1/m)x into the hyperbola equation.\n\nSo, x\u00b2/20 - [ (-1/m x )\u00b2 ] /24 = 1.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 m\u00b2 ) =1\n\nx\u00b2 (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2 )) =1\n\nWhich is exactly the equation we had earlier, leading to x\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2 )).\n\nSo, as long as 1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2 ) >0, which is equivalent to m\u00b2 >5/6, which is already our condition.\n\nSo, as m approaches sqrt(5/6) from above, the x\u00b2 approaches infinity, meaning points B and D go to infinity along the line y = (-1/m)x.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2, which is proportional to s\u00b2, also approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, meaning there is no upper bound. So, the supremum is infinity, but the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be made as large as desired, then the set of BD\u00b2 is unbounded above. Therefore, any real number would be less than BD\u00b2 for sufficiently large BD\u00b2. So, the problem must be interpreted differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, not the supremum. Because if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, then the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be negative infinity, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the greatest lower bound of BD\u00b2, i.e., the infimum. Let me check the wording again.\n\n\"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nHmm, that wording is a bit ambiguous. It could be interpreted as the supremum of the lower bounds, which would be the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the maximum lower bound, meaning the infimum.\n\nWait, if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, but perhaps it has a minimum value. So, the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because BD\u00b2 can't be smaller than that.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the minimum possible BD\u00b2.\n\nLet me think. So, if BD\u00b2 can be made as large as desired, but perhaps has a minimum value, then the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be that minimum BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, perhaps I should find the minimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, let's go back to BD\u00b2 = 480(k +1 ) / (6k -5 ), where 5/6 <k <6/5.\n\nWe can treat BD\u00b2 as a function f(k) = 480(k +1 ) / (6k -5 ), and find its minimum over the interval 5/6 <k <6/5.\n\nTo find the minimum, we can take the derivative of f(k) with respect to k, set it to zero, and find critical points.\n\nSo, let's compute f(k):\n\nf(k) = 480(k +1 ) / (6k -5 )\n\nCompute f'(k):\n\nUsing the quotient rule: f'(k) = [480*(6k -5 ) - 480(k +1 )*6 ] / (6k -5 )\u00b2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n480*(6k -5 ) - 480*6*(k +1 )\n\nFactor 480:\n\n480 [ (6k -5 ) -6(k +1 ) ]\n\n=480 [6k -5 -6k -6 ]\n\n=480 [ -11 ]\n\nSo, f'(k) = (-5280 ) / (6k -5 )\u00b2\n\nSince (6k -5 )\u00b2 is always positive for k >5/6, the derivative f'(k) is always negative.\n\nTherefore, f(k) is strictly decreasing on the interval 5/6 <k <6/5.\n\nSo, the function f(k) decreases as k increases.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of f(k) occurs at the right endpoint of the interval, which is k approaching 6/5 from below.\n\nAs k approaches 6/5, f(k) approaches 480*(6/5 +1 ) / (6*(6/5 ) -5 )\n\nCompute numerator: 6/5 +1 = 11/5\n\nDenominator: 36/5 -25/5 =11/5\n\nSo, f(k) approaches 480*(11/5 ) / (11/5 ) =480.\n\nSimilarly, as k approaches 5/6 from above, f(k) approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, since f(k) is strictly decreasing, the minimum value of BD\u00b2 is 480, approached as k approaches 6/5.\n\nBut wait, as k approaches 6/5, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, but does it actually attain 480?\n\nWait, when k =6/5, the denominator 6k -5 becomes 6*(6/5 ) -5 =36/5 -25/5=11/5, which is positive, but in our earlier condition, k must be less than 6/5. So, k approaches 6/5 from below, so f(k) approaches 480 from above.\n\nWait, but f(k) is decreasing, so as k increases, f(k) decreases. So, the minimal value is 480, but it's not attained; it's a limit as k approaches 6/5 from below.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but never less than 480.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier statement that as k approaches 6/5, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nWait, no, actually, f(k) is decreasing, so as k increases, f(k) decreases. So, the minimal value is approached as k approaches 6/5, but since k cannot reach 6/5, BD\u00b2 cannot reach 480, but can get arbitrarily close to it from above.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, and can be made as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480.\n\nSo, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, but it's not attained.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, but can be made arbitrarily close to 480.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, if BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, then 480 is the greatest lower bound. Therefore, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nSince BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as k approaches 6/5 from below, and for all other k in (5/6, 6/5), BD\u00b2 is greater than 480, then 480 is indeed the infimum, and the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier computation.\n\nEarlier, I had BD\u00b2 = 480(k +1 )/(6k -5 )\n\nAs k approaches 6/5, let's compute:\n\nk=6/5, then 6k=36/5, 36/5 -5=36/5 -25/5=11/5\n\nk+1=6/5 +5/5=11/5\n\nSo, (k+1)/(6k -5 )= (11/5)/(11/5 )=1\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480*1=480.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, approached as k approaches 6/5.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus \\(ABCD\\) inscribed in the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on a hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, the lower bound, and then find the greatest number that is less than this infimum.\n\nHmm, let me start by recalling some properties of rhombuses. In a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, actually, yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me confirm: yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's a key property.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. Therefore, the points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the lines AC and BD are perpendicular.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, the coordinates of the points can be expressed in terms of vectors. Let me denote point A as (x, y), then point C would be (-x, -y) because it's the opposite end of the diagonal. Similarly, points B and D can be expressed as (u, v) and (-u, -v) respectively. So, the four points are A(x, y), B(u, v), C(-x, -y), D(-u, -v).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, which equals the distance from C to D, and so on. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, another property is that the sides can be calculated using the lengths of the diagonals. Specifically, each side of the rhombus is equal to half the square root of the sum of the squares of the lengths of the diagonals. Wait, no, more accurately, if the lengths of the diagonals are p and q, then each side is (sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))/2. Wait, is that right? Let me think: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so each half of the diagonals forms a right triangle with the sides as legs and half the side of the rhombus as the hypotenuse. So, if the diagonals are p and q, then each half of the diagonals is p/2 and q/2, and the side length s is sqrt( (p/2)\u00b2 + (q/2)\u00b2 ) = (sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))/2. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, we're dealing with points on a hyperbola, so I need to make sure that points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, each point (x, y) must satisfy that equation.\n\nSo, let's write that down for point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. Similarly, for point B: u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSince the diagonals are AC and BD, their vectors are (2x, 2y) and (2u, 2v). Wait, no, the vectors for the diagonals would be from A to C, which is (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y), but since the diagonals are just the lines connecting the points, their direction vectors can be represented as (x, y) and (u, v), but since the origin is the midpoint, maybe it's better to think in terms of vectors from the origin.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of the diagonals as vectors. So, the diagonal AC is from A(x, y) to C(-x, -y), so the vector is (-2x, -2y), but that's just twice the vector from the origin to C. Similarly, the diagonal BD is from B(u, v) to D(-u, -v), so the vector is (-2u, -2v). But perhaps it's easier to think of the diagonals as vectors OA and OB, but scaled. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the dot product of vectors AC and BD should be zero. Wait, no, the diagonals are AC and BD, so vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular. So, the vector AC is ( -x - x, -y - y ) = (-2x, -2y). The vector BD is ( -u - u, -v - v ) = (-2u, -2v). So, the dot product of AC and BD should be zero because they're perpendicular.\n\nSo, (-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 0 \u21d2 4xu + 4yv = 0 \u21d2 xu + yv = 0.\n\nSo, that gives us the equation xu + yv = 0. That's one condition.\n\nNow, since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, we have:\n\nFor A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nFor B: u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have these two equations, plus the condition xu + yv = 0.\n\nOur goal is to find BD\u00b2. Let's see, BD is the diagonal from B(u, v) to D(-u, -v). So, the length of BD is the distance between B and D. Let's compute that.\n\nDistance BD = sqrt[ ( -u - u )\u00b2 + ( -v - v )\u00b2 ] = sqrt[ (-2u)\u00b2 + (-2v)^2 ] = sqrt[4u\u00b2 + 4v\u00b2] = 2 sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 is (2 sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nWe need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is the greatest lower bound for BD\u00b2, and then the answer would be that infimum.\n\nWait, actually, the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to the infimum but not less than it. So, the infimum is the greatest lower bound.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, which is 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2), given the constraints that points A(x, y) and B(u, v) lie on the hyperbola, and xu + yv = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps I can set up an optimization problem. Let's define variables x, y, u, v such that:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\n2. u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\n3. xu + yv = 0.\n\nWe need to minimize BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSo, let's think about how to approach this. Maybe we can use Lagrange multipliers, but that might be complicated with four variables. Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize points on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, hyperbola parametrization. The given hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening along the x-axis.\n\nA standard parametrization for hyperbola is x = a sec \u03b8, y = b tan \u03b8, where a\u00b2 = 20 and b\u00b2 = 24. So, a = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5), and b = sqrt(24) = 2*sqrt(6).\n\nSo, we can write point A as (2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan \u03b8). Similarly, point B can be another point on the hyperbola, but with some angle \u03c6. But since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors OA and OB must satisfy the condition xu + yv = 0.\n\nWait, but since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular, which translates to xu + yv = 0 as we found earlier.\n\nWait, but in terms of parametrization, if point A is (2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan \u03b8), then point C is (-2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan \u03b8). Similarly, point B is (2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan \u03c6), and point D is (-2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, -2\u221a6 tan \u03c6).\n\nSo, the vectors AC is from A to C: (-4\u221a5 sec \u03b8, -4\u221a6 tan \u03b8). The vector BD is from B to D: (-4\u221a5 sec \u03c6, -4\u221a6 tan \u03c6). The dot product of AC and BD should be zero because the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nWait, but earlier, we found that xu + yv = 0, which in terms of the parametrization would be:\n\nx = 2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, y = 2\u221a6 tan \u03b8,\n\nu = 2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, v = 2\u221a6 tan \u03c6.\n\nSo, xu + yv = (2\u221a5 sec \u03b8)(2\u221a5 sec \u03c6) + (2\u221a6 tan \u03b8)(2\u221a6 tan \u03c6) = (4*5 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6) + (4*6 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6) = 20 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 + 24 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6 = 0.\n\nSo, 20 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 + 24 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6 = 0.\n\nWe can write this equation as:\n\n20 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 = -24 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6.\n\nDividing both sides by sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6:\n\n20 = -24 (tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6) / (sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6).\n\nBut tan \u03b8 = sin \u03b8 / cos \u03b8, and sec \u03b8 = 1 / cos \u03b8.\n\nSo, tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6 = (sin \u03b8 / cos \u03b8)(sin \u03c6 / cos \u03c6) = (sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6) / (cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6).\n\nSimilarly, sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 = 1/(cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6).\n\nSo, (tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6)/(sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6) = (sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6)/(cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6) * (cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6)/1 = sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6.\n\nTherefore, 20 = -24 (sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6).\n\nSo, 20 = -24 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 \u21d2 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -20/24 = -5/6.\n\nSo, sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nThat's a key equation.\n\nNow, our goal is to minimize BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). Let's express u and v in terms of \u03c6.\n\nu = 2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, v = 2\u221a6 tan \u03c6.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = (2\u221a5 sec \u03c6)^2 + (2\u221a6 tan \u03c6)^2 = 20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4*(20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6) = 80 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 96 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nWe need to express this in terms that can be minimized, perhaps using the relation we found earlier, sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWait, but we have two variables \u03b8 and \u03c6, but related by sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6. So, maybe we can express one in terms of the other and then find the minimum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a relationship between sec\u00b2 \u03c6 and tan\u00b2 \u03c6, and then express BD\u00b2 in terms of a single variable.\n\nWait, let's note that sec\u00b2 \u03c6 = 1 + tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80*(1 + tan\u00b2 \u03c6) + 96 tan\u00b2 \u03c6 = 80 + 80 tan\u00b2 \u03c6 + 96 tan\u00b2 \u03c6 = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nHmm, but we still have the relation sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6. So, perhaps we can find a relationship between \u03b8 and \u03c6, and then express tan\u00b2 \u03c6 in terms of \u03b8, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find another equation involving \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nWait, let's recall that points A and B are on the hyperbola, and we have the relation sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6. Maybe we can find another equation involving cos \u03b8 and cos \u03c6, perhaps using the parametrization.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let's denote t = tan \u03c6. Then, since sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6, and we can write sin \u03b8 = (-5/6)/sin \u03c6.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps express sin \u03b8 in terms of sin \u03c6, and then relate cos \u03b8 and cos \u03c6.\n\nWait, another approach: Since we have two variables \u03b8 and \u03c6, related by sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6, perhaps we can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute into BD\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can parametrize one variable and express the other.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that since sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6, we can write sin \u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin \u03c6).\n\nBut we also know that sin\u00b2 \u03b8 + cos\u00b2 \u03b8 = 1. Similarly for \u03c6.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express cos \u03b8 in terms of sin \u03c6, and then find a relationship.\n\nWait, let me try this:\n\nFrom sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6, we have sin \u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin \u03c6).\n\nBut since sin \u03b8 must be between -1 and 1, we have | (-5)/(6 sin \u03c6) | \u2264 1 \u21d2 |5/(6 sin \u03c6)| \u2264 1 \u21d2 |sin \u03c6| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, |sin \u03c6| \u2265 5/6. Therefore, sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2265 25/36.\n\nSimilarly, since sin\u00b2 \u03c6 + cos\u00b2 \u03c6 = 1, cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2264 1 - 25/36 = 11/36.\n\nSo, cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2264 11/36 \u21d2 |cos \u03c6| \u2264 sqrt(11)/6 \u2248 0.527.\n\nBut how does that help us?\n\nWait, let me think about BD\u00b2 again. We have BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nAnd tan \u03c6 = sin \u03c6 / cos \u03c6.\n\nSo, tan\u00b2 \u03c6 = (sin\u00b2 \u03c6)/(cos\u00b2 \u03c6).\n\nGiven that sin\u00b2 \u03c6 = 1 - cos\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, tan\u00b2 \u03c6 = (1 - cos\u00b2 \u03c6)/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 = (1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6) - 1.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176*(1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 - 1) = 80 + 176*(1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6) - 176.\n\nSimplify: 80 - 176 = -96, so BD\u00b2 = -96 + 176*(1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6).\n\nBut 1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 is sec\u00b2 \u03c6, which is always \u22651, but we have a constraint on cos\u00b2 \u03c6 from earlier.\n\nWe found that cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2264 11/36.\n\nSo, 1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2265 36/11.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 = 176*(1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6) - 96 \u2265 176*(36/11) - 96.\n\nCompute that:\n\n176 divided by 11 is 16. So, 16*36 = 576. So, 576 - 96 = 480.\n\nWait, so BD\u00b2 \u2265 480.\n\nHmm, is that the minimum? Let me check.\n\nBecause 1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 is minimized when cos\u00b2 \u03c6 is maximized, which is 11/36, so 1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 is 36/11, which gives BD\u00b2 as 176*(36/11) -96 = (176/11)*36 -96 = 16*36 -96 = 576 -96 = 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is at least 480. So, the infimum is 480, meaning that BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure.\n\nBecause when we have BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6, and tan\u00b2 \u03c6 = (sin\u00b2 \u03c6)/(cos\u00b2 \u03c6) = (1 - cos\u00b2 \u03c6)/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 = 1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 -1.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176*(1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 -1) = 80 + 176/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 -176 = 176/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 -96.\n\nNow, since cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2264 11/36, the minimal value of 1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 is 36/11. Therefore, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 176*(36/11) -96 = (176/11)*36 -96 = 16*36 -96 = 576 -96 = 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 cannot be less than 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but let me check if this is achievable. That is, is there a rhombus where BD\u00b2 = 480? Because if the infimum is 480, then BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480, but maybe not equal. So, we need to check if BD\u00b2 can actually reach 480.\n\nSo, when does BD\u00b2 = 480? That would be when 176/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 -96 =480 \u21d2 176/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 = 576 \u21d2 cos\u00b2 \u03c6 =176/576 = 11/36.\n\nWhich is exactly the maximum value of cos\u00b2 \u03c6. So, when cos\u00b2 \u03c6 =11/36, which occurs when |cos \u03c6|=sqrt(11)/6, which is valid because |sqrt(11)/6| \u2248 0.527 <1.\n\nSo, yes, BD\u00b2 can reach 480. Therefore, the infimum is 480, and the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but hold on. The problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, since BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480. Because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, so 480 is the lower bound, and thus the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but actually, if BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, then the infimum is 480, and the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 \u2265480, so 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2. So, 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, then 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=480, it's equal, not less. So, in that case, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, but since 480 is attainable, the supremum of the lower bounds would be 480, but since we need a number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, it's the supremum of the lower bounds, which is 480, but since 480 is attainable, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, but wait, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about it differently. The infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, which means that BD\u00b2 can get as close as desired to 480 from above. So, for any \u03b5>0, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < 480 + \u03b5. Therefore, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because for any number greater than 480, say 480 + \u03b5, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than that (i.e., 480 < BD\u00b2 < 480 + \u03b5). So, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because any number larger than 480 would not satisfy the condition for all rhombi (as some rhombi have BD\u00b2=480 or larger).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, then 480 is the infimum. Therefore, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 \u2265480. So, 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2. But the question wants the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, if 480 is the infimum, then for any \u03b5>0, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 <480 + \u03b5. So, the greatest lower bound is 480, but since BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 \u2265480, so 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2. Therefore, 480 is the greatest number that is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But the question says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, then 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=480, 480 is not less than 480. So, in that case, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be just below 480. But since we're dealing with real numbers, there's no maximum number less than 480, but the infimum is 480. So, perhaps the problem is expecting 480 as the answer, considering that the infimum is 480, even though technically 480 is attainable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier reasoning. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, when I computed BD\u00b2, I used the points B(u, v) and D(-u, -v). So, the distance BD is sqrt[(-u - u)^2 + (-v - v)^2] = sqrt[(-2u)^2 + (-2v)^2] = sqrt[4u\u00b2 +4v\u00b2] = 2 sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). Therefore, BD\u00b2 is 4(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2).\n\nBut in the hyperbola, points B and D are on the hyperbola, so u\u00b2/20 -v\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nWait, but in my earlier parametrization, I considered points A and B as (2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan \u03b8) and (2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan \u03c6), respectively. But in reality, the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, so for point B, u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24=1.\n\nWait, but in my parametrization, I used u =2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, which would make u\u00b2 = (4*5) sec\u00b2 \u03c6=20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6. Similarly, v=2\u221a6 tan \u03c6 \u21d2 v\u00b2=24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6. So, u\u00b2/20 -v\u00b2/24= sec\u00b2 \u03c6 - tan\u00b2 \u03c6=1, which checks out because sec\u00b2 \u03c6 - tan\u00b2 \u03c6=1. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2)=4*(20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6)=80 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 +96 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nThen, since tan\u00b2 \u03c6=sec\u00b2 \u03c6 -1, we can write BD\u00b2=80 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 +96 (sec\u00b2 \u03c6 -1)=80 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 +96 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 -96=176 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 -96.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=176 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 -96.\n\nWe also have the condition that sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6= -5/6.\n\nExpressed in terms of sec \u03c6 and tan \u03c6, perhaps we can relate this.\n\nWait, but earlier, I tried to express BD\u00b2 in terms of cos \u03c6 and found that BD\u00b2=176/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 -96, which is the same as 176 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 -96.\n\nAnd we found that cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u226411/36, so sec\u00b2 \u03c6 \u226536/11. Therefore, BD\u00b2\u2265176*(36/11) -96= 176/11 *36 -96=16*36 -96=576-96=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2\u2265480.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480. So, any number greater than 480 would not satisfy the condition of being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, since some rhombi have BD\u00b2=480. Therefore, 480 is the greatest such number.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, then 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi; it's equal for some rhombi. So, perhaps the answer is 480, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, in that case, 480 is the infimum, and the answer would be 480, because for any \u03b5>0, there's a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than 480 + \u03b5, but for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is at least 480. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because you can't have a number greater than 480 that's less than all BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is phrased such that it's looking for the infimum, which is 480. So, perhaps the answer is 480.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that BD\u00b2 cannot be less than 480, so 480 is the minimum, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: since the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1, we can think of points A and B such that OA and OB are conjugate diameters of the hyperbola. Because in a hyperbola, if two diameters are conjugate, then the tangent at one end of a diameter is parallel to the other diameter.\n\nWait, but in our case, the diagonals are perpendicular, so perhaps they are conjugate diameters. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the concept of conjugate points on hyperbola. For a hyperbola, two points are conjugate if the tangent at one point is parallel to the line joining the other point to the center. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the concept of reciprocal hyperbola or something else, but I think the earlier approach is more straightforward.\n\nSo, to recap, we have:\n\n- BD\u00b2 = 176 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 -96.\n\n- From the condition sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6, we found that cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u226411/36.\n\n- Therefore, sec\u00b2 \u03c6 \u226536/11.\n\n- Hence, BD\u00b2 \u2265176*(36/11) -96 =480.\n\n- Therefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nThus, the answer is 480.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on a hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, the lower bound, and then find the greatest number that is less than this infimum.\n\nHmm, let me start by recalling some properties of rhombuses. In a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, actually, yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me confirm: yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's a key property.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. Therefore, the points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the lines AC and BD are perpendicular.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, the coordinates of the points can be expressed in terms of vectors. Let me denote point A as (x, y), then point C would be (-x, -y) because it's the opposite end of the diagonal. Similarly, points B and D can be expressed as (u, v) and (-u, -v) respectively. So, the four points are A(x, y), B(u, v), C(-x, -y), D(-u, -v).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, which equals the distance from C to D, and so on. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, another property is that the sides can be calculated using the lengths of the diagonals. Specifically, each side of the rhombus is equal to half the square root of the sum of the squares of the lengths of the diagonals. Wait, no, more accurately, if the lengths of the diagonals are p and q, then each side is (sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))/2. Wait, is that right? Let me think: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so each half of the diagonals forms a right triangle with the sides as legs and half the side of the rhombus as the hypotenuse. So, if the diagonals are p and q, then each half of the diagonals is p/2 and q/2, and the side length s is sqrt( (p/2)\u00b2 + (q/2)\u00b2 ) = (sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))/2. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, we're dealing with points on a hyperbola, so I need to make sure that points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, each point (x, y) must satisfy that equation.\n\nSo, let's write that down for point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. Similarly, for point B: u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSince the diagonals are AC and BD, their vectors are (2x, 2y) and (2u, 2v). Wait, no, the vectors for the diagonals would be from A to C, which is (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y), but since the diagonals are just the lines connecting the points, their direction vectors can be represented as (x, y) and (u, v), but since the origin is the midpoint, maybe it's better to think in terms of vectors from the origin.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of the diagonals as vectors. So, the diagonal AC is from A(x, y) to C(-x, -y), so the vector is (-2x, -2y), but that's just twice the vector from the origin to C. Similarly, the diagonal BD is from B(u, v) to D(-u, -v), so the vector is (-2u, -2v). But perhaps it's easier to think of the diagonals as vectors OA and OB, but scaled. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the dot product of vectors AC and BD should be zero. Wait, no, the diagonals are AC and BD, so vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular. So, the vector AC is ( -x - x, -y - y ) = (-2x, -2y). The vector BD is ( -u - u, -v - v ) = (-2u, -2v). So, the dot product of AC and BD should be zero because they're perpendicular.\n\nSo, (-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 0 \u21d2 4xu + 4yv = 0 \u21d2 xu + yv = 0.\n\nSo, that gives us the equation xu + yv = 0. That's one condition.\n\nNow, since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, we have:\n\nFor A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nFor B: u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have these two equations, plus the condition xu + yv = 0.\n\nOur goal is to find BD\u00b2. Let's see, BD is the diagonal from B(u, v) to D(-u, -v). So, the length of BD is the distance between B and D. Let's compute that.\n\nDistance BD = sqrt[ ( -u - u )\u00b2 + ( -v - v )\u00b2 ] = sqrt[ (-2u)\u00b2 + (-2v)^2 ] = sqrt[4u\u00b2 + 4v\u00b2] = 2 sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 is (2 sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nWe need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is the greatest lower bound for BD\u00b2, and then the answer would be that infimum.\n\nWait, actually, the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to the infimum but not less than it. So, the infimum is the greatest lower bound.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, which is 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2), given the constraints that points A(x, y) and B(u, v) lie on the hyperbola, and xu + yv = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps I can set up an optimization problem. Let's define variables x, y, u, v such that:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\n2. u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\n3. xu + yv = 0.\n\nWe need to minimize BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSo, let's think about how to approach this. Maybe we can use Lagrange multipliers, but that might be complicated with four variables. Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize points on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, hyperbola parametrization. The given hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening along the x-axis.\n\nA standard parametrization for hyperbola is x = a sec \u03b8, y = b tan \u03b8, where a\u00b2 = 20 and b\u00b2 = 24. So, a = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5), and b = sqrt(24) = 2*sqrt(6).\n\nSo, we can write point A as (2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan \u03b8). Similarly, point B can be another point on the hyperbola, but with some angle \u03c6. But since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors OA and OB must satisfy the condition xu + yv = 0.\n\nWait, but since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular, which translates to xu + yv = 0 as we found earlier.\n\nWait, but in terms of parametrization, if point A is (2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan \u03b8), then point C is (-2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan \u03b8). Similarly, point B is (2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan \u03c6), and point D is (-2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, -2\u221a6 tan \u03c6).\n\nSo, the vectors AC is from A to C: (-4\u221a5 sec \u03b8, -4\u221a6 tan \u03b8). The vector BD is from B to D: (-4\u221a5 sec \u03c6, -4\u221a6 tan \u03c6). The dot product of AC and BD should be zero because the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nWait, but earlier, we found that xu + yv = 0, which in terms of the parametrization would be:\n\nx = 2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, y = 2\u221a6 tan \u03b8,\n\nu = 2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, v = 2\u221a6 tan \u03c6.\n\nSo, xu + yv = (2\u221a5 sec \u03b8)(2\u221a5 sec \u03c6) + (2\u221a6 tan \u03b8)(2\u221a6 tan \u03c6) = (4*5 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6) + (4*6 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6) = 20 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 + 24 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6 = 0.\n\nSo, 20 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 + 24 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6 = 0.\n\nWe can write this equation as:\n\n20 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 = -24 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6.\n\nDividing both sides by sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6:\n\n20 = -24 (tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6) / (sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6).\n\nBut tan \u03b8 = sin \u03b8 / cos \u03b8, and sec \u03b8 = 1 / cos \u03b8.\n\nSo, tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6 = (sin \u03b8 / cos \u03b8)(sin \u03c6 / cos \u03c6) = (sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6) / (cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6).\n\nSimilarly, sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 = 1/(cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6).\n\nSo, (tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6)/(sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6) = (sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6)/(cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6) * (cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6)/1 = sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6.\n\nTherefore, 20 = -24 (sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6).\n\nSo, 20 = -24 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 \u21d2 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -20/24 = -5/6.\n\nSo, sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nThat's a key equation.\n\nNow, our goal is to minimize BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). Let's express u and v in terms of \u03c6.\n\nu = 2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, v = 2\u221a6 tan \u03c6.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = (2\u221a5 sec \u03c6)^2 + (2\u221a6 tan \u03c6)^2 = 20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4*(20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6) = 80 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 96 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nWe need to express this in terms that can be minimized, perhaps using the relation we found earlier, sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWait, but we have two variables \u03b8 and \u03c6, but related by sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6. So, maybe we can express one in terms of the other and then find the minimum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a relationship between sec\u00b2 \u03c6 and tan\u00b2 \u03c6, and then express BD\u00b2 in terms of a single variable.\n\nWait, let's note that sec\u00b2 \u03c6 = 1 + tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80*(1 + tan\u00b2 \u03c6) + 96 tan\u00b2 \u03c6 = 80 + 80 tan\u00b2 \u03c6 + 96 tan\u00b2 \u03c6 = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nHmm, but we still have the relation sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6. So, perhaps we can find a relationship between \u03b8 and \u03c6, and then express tan\u00b2 \u03c6 in terms of \u03b8, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find another equation involving \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nWait, let's recall that points A and B are on the hyperbola, and we have the relation sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6. Maybe we can find another equation involving cos \u03b8 and cos \u03c6, perhaps using the parametrization.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let's denote t = tan \u03c6. Then, since sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6, and we can write sin \u03b8 = (-5/6)/sin \u03c6.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps express sin \u03b8 in terms of sin \u03c6, and then relate cos \u03b8 and cos \u03c6.\n\nWait, another approach: Since we have two variables \u03b8 and \u03c6, related by sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6, perhaps we can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute into BD\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can parametrize one variable and express the other.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that since sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6, we can write sin \u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin \u03c6).\n\nBut we also know that sin\u00b2 \u03b8 + cos\u00b2 \u03b8 = 1. Similarly for \u03c6.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express cos \u03b8 in terms of sin \u03c6, and then find a relationship.\n\nWait, let me try this:\n\nFrom sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6, we have sin \u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin \u03c6).\n\nBut since sin \u03b8 must be between -1 and 1, we have | (-5)/(6 sin \u03c6) | \u2264 1 \u21d2 |5/(6 sin \u03c6)| \u2264 1 \u21d2 |sin \u03c6| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, |sin \u03c6| \u2265 5/6. Therefore, sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2265 25/36.\n\nSimilarly, since sin\u00b2 \u03c6 + cos\u00b2 \u03c6 = 1, cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2264 1 - 25/36 = 11/36.\n\nSo, cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2264 11/36 \u21d2 |cos \u03c6| \u2264 sqrt(11)/6 \u2248 0.527.\n\nBut how does that help us?\n\nWait, let me think about BD\u00b2 again. We have BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nAnd tan \u03c6 = sin \u03c6 / cos \u03c6.\n\nSo, tan\u00b2 \u03c6 = (sin\u00b2 \u03c6)/(cos\u00b2 \u03c6).\n\nGiven that sin\u00b2 \u03c6 = 1 - cos\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, tan\u00b2 \u03c6 = (1 - cos\u00b2 \u03c6)/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 = (1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6) - 1.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176*(1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 - 1) = 80 + 176*(1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6) - 176.\n\nSimplify: 80 - 176 = -96, so BD\u00b2 = -96 + 176*(1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6).\n\nBut 1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 is sec\u00b2 \u03c6, which is always \u22651, but we have a constraint on cos\u00b2 \u03c6 from earlier.\n\nWe found that cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2264 11/36.\n\nSo, 1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2265 36/11.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 = 176*(1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6) - 96 \u2265 176*(36/11) - 96.\n\nCompute that:\n\n176 divided by 11 is 16. So, 16*36 = 576. So, 576 - 96 = 480.\n\nWait, so BD\u00b2 \u2265 480.\n\nHmm, is that the minimum? Let me check.\n\nBecause 1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 is minimized when cos\u00b2 \u03c6 is maximized, which is 11/36, so 1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 is 36/11, which gives BD\u00b2 as 176*(36/11) -96 = (176/11)*36 -96 = 16*36 -96 = 576 -96 = 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is at least 480. So, the infimum is 480, meaning that BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure.\n\nBecause when we have BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6, and tan\u00b2 \u03c6 = (sin\u00b2 \u03c6)/(cos\u00b2 \u03c6) = (1 - cos\u00b2 \u03c6)/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 = 1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 -1.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176*(1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 -1) = 80 + 176/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 -176 = 176/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 -96.\n\nNow, since cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2264 11/36, the minimal value of 1/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 is 36/11. Therefore, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 176*(36/11) -96 = (176/11)*36 -96 = 16*36 -96 = 576 -96 = 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 cannot be less than 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but let me check if this is achievable. That is, is there a rhombus where BD\u00b2 = 480? Because if the infimum is 480, then BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480, but maybe not equal. So, we need to check if BD\u00b2 can actually reach 480.\n\nSo, when does BD\u00b2 = 480? That would be when 176/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 -96 =480 \u21d2 176/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 = 576 \u21d2 cos\u00b2 \u03c6 =176/576 = 11/36.\n\nWhich is exactly the maximum value of cos\u00b2 \u03c6. So, when cos\u00b2 \u03c6 =11/36, which occurs when |cos \u03c6|=sqrt(11)/6, which is valid because |sqrt(11)/6| \u2248 0.527 <1.\n\nSo, yes, BD\u00b2 can reach 480. Therefore, the infimum is 480, and the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but hold on. The problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, since BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480. Because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, so 480 is the lower bound, and thus the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but actually, if BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, then the infimum is 480, and the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 \u2265480, so 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2. So, 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, then 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=480, it's equal, not less. So, in that case, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, but since 480 is attainable, the supremum of the lower bounds would be 480, but since we need a number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, it's the supremum of the lower bounds, which is 480, but since 480 is attainable, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, but wait, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about it differently. The infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, which means that BD\u00b2 can get as close as desired to 480 from above. So, for any \u03b5>0, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 < 480 + \u03b5. Therefore, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because for any number greater than 480, say 480 + \u03b5, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than that (i.e., 480 < BD\u00b2 < 480 + \u03b5). So, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because any number larger than 480 would not satisfy the condition for all rhombi (as some rhombi have BD\u00b2=480 or larger).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, then 480 is the infimum. Therefore, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 \u2265480. So, 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2. But the question wants the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, if 480 is the infimum, then for any \u03b5>0, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 <480 + \u03b5. So, the greatest lower bound is 480, but since BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 \u2265480, so 480 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2. Therefore, 480 is the greatest number that is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But the question says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, then 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=480, 480 is not less than 480. So, in that case, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be just below 480. But since we're dealing with real numbers, there's no maximum number less than 480, but the infimum is 480. So, perhaps the problem is expecting 480 as the answer, considering that the infimum is 480, even though technically 480 is attainable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier reasoning. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, when I computed BD\u00b2, I used the points B(u, v) and D(-u, -v). So, the distance BD is sqrt[(-u - u)^2 + (-v - v)^2] = sqrt[(-2u)^2 + (-2v)^2] = sqrt[4u\u00b2 +4v\u00b2] = 2 sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). Therefore, BD\u00b2 is 4(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2).\n\nBut in the hyperbola, points B and D are on the hyperbola, so u\u00b2/20 -v\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nWait, but in my earlier parametrization, I considered points A and B as (2\u221a5 sec \u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan \u03b8) and (2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan \u03c6), respectively. But in reality, the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, so for point B, u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24=1.\n\nWait, but in my parametrization, I used u =2\u221a5 sec \u03c6, which would make u\u00b2 = (4*5) sec\u00b2 \u03c6=20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6. Similarly, v=2\u221a6 tan \u03c6 \u21d2 v\u00b2=24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6. So, u\u00b2/20 -v\u00b2/24= sec\u00b2 \u03c6 - tan\u00b2 \u03c6=1, which checks out because sec\u00b2 \u03c6 - tan\u00b2 \u03c6=1. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2)=4*(20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6)=80 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 +96 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nThen, since tan\u00b2 \u03c6=sec\u00b2 \u03c6 -1, we can write BD\u00b2=80 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 +96 (sec\u00b2 \u03c6 -1)=80 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 +96 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 -96=176 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 -96.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=176 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 -96.\n\nWe also have the condition that sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6= -5/6.\n\nExpressed in terms of sec \u03c6 and tan \u03c6, perhaps we can relate this.\n\nWait, but earlier, I tried to express BD\u00b2 in terms of cos \u03c6 and found that BD\u00b2=176/cos\u00b2 \u03c6 -96, which is the same as 176 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 -96.\n\nAnd we found that cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u226411/36, so sec\u00b2 \u03c6 \u226536/11. Therefore, BD\u00b2\u2265176*(36/11) -96= 176/11 *36 -96=16*36 -96=576-96=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2\u2265480.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480. So, any number greater than 480 would not satisfy the condition of being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, since some rhombi have BD\u00b2=480. Therefore, 480 is the greatest such number.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, then 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi; it's equal for some rhombi. So, perhaps the answer is 480, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, in that case, 480 is the infimum, and the answer would be 480, because for any \u03b5>0, there's a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than 480 + \u03b5, but for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is at least 480. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because you can't have a number greater than 480 that's less than all BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is phrased such that it's looking for the infimum, which is 480. So, perhaps the answer is 480.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that BD\u00b2 cannot be less than 480, so 480 is the minimum, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: since the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1, we can think of points A and B such that OA and OB are conjugate diameters of the hyperbola. Because in a hyperbola, if two diameters are conjugate, then the tangent at one end of a diameter is parallel to the other diameter.\n\nWait, but in our case, the diagonals are perpendicular, so perhaps they are conjugate diameters. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the concept of conjugate points on hyperbola. For a hyperbola, two points are conjugate if the tangent at one point is parallel to the line joining the other point to the center. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the concept of reciprocal hyperbola or something else, but I think the earlier approach is more straightforward.\n\nSo, to recap, we have:\n\n- BD\u00b2 = 176 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 -96.\n\n- From the condition sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6, we found that cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u226411/36.\n\n- Therefore, sec\u00b2 \u03c6 \u226536/11.\n\n- Hence, BD\u00b2 \u2265176*(36/11) -96 =480.\n\n- Therefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nThus, the answer is 480.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the rhombus \\(ABCD\\) has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. The points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) lie on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\). The diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular, and their lengths can be related to the coordinates of the points.\n\nWe parametrize the points on the hyperbola using the standard parametrization:\n- \\(A = (2\\sqrt{5} \\sec \\theta, 2\\sqrt{6} \\tan \\theta)\\)\n- \\(B = (2\\sqrt{5} \\sec \\phi, 2\\sqrt{6} \\tan \\phi)\\)\n\nThe condition that the diagonals are perpendicular leads to the equation:\n\\[\n20 \\sec \\theta \\sec \\phi + 24 \\tan \\theta \\tan \\phi = 0\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\sin \\theta \\sin \\phi = -\\frac{5}{6}\n\\]\n\nThe length of diagonal \\(BD\\) is given by:\n\\[\nBD^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2)\n\\]\nwhere \\(u = 2\\sqrt{5} \\sec \\phi\\) and \\(v = 2\\sqrt{6} \\tan \\phi\\). Substituting these into the expression for \\(BD^2\\), we get:\n\\[\nBD^2 = 80 \\sec^2 \\phi + 96 \\tan^2 \\phi\n\\]\n\nUsing the identity \\(\\tan^2 \\phi = \\sec^2 \\phi - 1\\), we rewrite \\(BD^2\\) as:\n\\[\nBD^2 = 176 \\sec^2 \\phi - 96\n\\]\n\nGiven the constraint \\(\\sin \\theta \\sin \\phi = -\\frac{5}{6}\\), we find that \\(\\cos^2 \\phi \\leq \\frac{11}{36}\\). Consequently, \\(\\sec^2 \\phi \\geq \\frac{36}{11}\\). Substituting this into the expression for \\(BD^2\\), we find:\n\\[\nBD^2 \\geq 176 \\cdot \\frac{36}{11} - 96 = 480\n\\]\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is \\(\\boxed{480}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nThe hyperbola is given by the equation (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1. So that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis. The standard form is (x\u00b2/a\u00b2) - (y\u00b2/b\u00b2) = 1, so here a\u00b2=20 and b\u00b2=24. Therefore, a=\u221a20 and b=\u221a24. Simplifying, a is 2\u221a5 and b is 2\u221a6.\n\nNow, the problem mentions points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola such that ABCD is a rhombus. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the rhombus is symmetric about the origin, meaning that if a point (x, y) is on the hyperbola, then the point (-x, -y) is also on the hyperbola, which is true because substituting (-x, -y) into the equation gives the same result.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: In a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Hmm, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me recall: Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, they intersect at right angles and bisect each other.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense. So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, and its diagonals are along the coordinate axes or some other lines, but they must be perpendicular.\n\nLet me think about the properties. Let's denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Since diagonals intersect at the origin, and ABCD is a rhombus, then points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other. Because in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.\n\nSo, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D is (-p, -q). So, all four points are on the hyperbola.\n\nNow, in a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distances AB, BC, CD, DA are all equal.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, perhaps we can use the slopes of the diagonals to find some relationships.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to parameterize the points.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, and in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular.\n\nSo, the diagonals are perpendicular lines passing through the origin, intersecting at the origin. So, if AC is along a line with slope m, then BD must be along a line with slope -1/m, since they are perpendicular.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's easier to model the points as lying on lines through the origin. Let me consider points A and C lying along one line, and points B and D lying along another line, perpendicular to the first.\n\nSo, suppose that diagonal AC lies along a line making an angle \u03b8 with the x-axis, and diagonal BD lies along a line making an angle \u03b8 + 90 degrees (since they are perpendicular).\n\nThen, points A and C can be written in terms of some parameter, say, t, as (t cos\u03b8, t sin\u03b8), and (-t cos\u03b8, -t sin\u03b8). Similarly, points B and D can be written as (s cos(\u03b8 + 90\u00b0), s sin(\u03b8 + 90\u00b0)) which simplifies to (-s sin\u03b8, s cos\u03b8), and (s sin\u03b8, -s cos\u03b8).\n\nWait, perhaps that's a way to parameterize the points.\n\nBut since all four points lie on the hyperbola, substituting their coordinates into the hyperbola equation will give us conditions on t and s.\n\nSo, let's write that.\n\nFor point A: (t cos\u03b8, t sin\u03b8) must satisfy (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSo,\n\n(t cos\u03b8)\u00b2 / 20 - (t sin\u03b8)^2 /24 = 1\n\nSimilarly, for point B: (-s sin\u03b8, s cos\u03b8) must satisfy:\n\n(-s sin\u03b8)^2 /20 - (s cos\u03b8)^2 /24 = 1\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(s\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (s\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 = 1\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) (t\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (t\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24 = 1\n\n2) (s\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (s\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 = 1\n\nNow, let's see if we can relate t and s.\n\nBut since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. Let's compute the distance between points A and B, which should be equal to the distance between B and C, etc.\n\nWait, but perhaps another approach is to note that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and satisfy the relationship: (diagonal1)^2 + (diagonal2)^2 = 4*(side)^2.\n\nBut in this case, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, if AC has length 2t and BD has length 2s, then:\n\n(2t)^2 + (2s)^2 = 4*(side)^2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n4t\u00b2 + 4s\u00b2 = 4*(side)^2\n\nSo, t\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = (side)^2.\n\nAlternatively, since all sides are equal, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C.\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nCompute distance AB:\n\nA is (t cos\u03b8, t sin\u03b8)\n\nB is (-s sin\u03b8, s cos\u03b8)\n\nSo, AB^2 = [ (-s sin\u03b8 - t cos\u03b8)^2 + (s cos\u03b8 - t sin\u03b8)^2 ]\n\nSimilarly, compute BC^2:\n\nB is (-s sin\u03b8, s cos\u03b8)\n\nC is (-t cos\u03b8, -t sin\u03b8)\n\nSo, BC^2 = [ (-t cos\u03b8 + s sin\u03b8)^2 + (-t sin\u03b8 - s cos\u03b8)^2 ]\n\nSince AB = BC, their squares should be equal:\n\n[ (-s sin\u03b8 - t cos\u03b8)^2 + (s cos\u03b8 - t sin\u03b8)^2 ] = [ (-t cos\u03b8 + s sin\u03b8)^2 + (-t sin\u03b8 - s cos\u03b8)^2 ]\n\nLet me compute both sides.\n\nLeft Side:\n\n(-s sin\u03b8 - t cos\u03b8)^2 = (s sin\u03b8 + t cos\u03b8)^2 = s\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + t\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8\n\n(s cos\u03b8 - t sin\u03b8)^2 = s\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8 - 2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + t\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nAdding these together:\n\ns\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + t\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8 + s\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8 - 2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + t\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nSimplify:\n\ns\u00b2 (sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8) + t\u00b2 (cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8) + (2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 - 2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 )\n\nWhich simplifies to s\u00b2 + t\u00b2, since sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1 and the cross terms cancel.\n\nRight Side:\n\n(-t cos\u03b8 + s sin\u03b8)^2 = t\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8 - 2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + s\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\n(-t sin\u03b8 - s cos\u03b8)^2 = t\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + s\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8\n\nAdding these together:\n\nt\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8 - 2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + s\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + t\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + s\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8\n\nSimplify:\n\nt\u00b2 (cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8) + s\u00b2 (sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8) + (-2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + 2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 )\n\nAgain, this simplifies to t\u00b2 + s\u00b2.\n\nSo, both sides equal t\u00b2 + s\u00b2, so the equation holds. So, that condition is satisfied. So, no new information there.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I need another condition to relate t and s.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can use the hyperbola equations.\n\nFrom earlier, we had:\n\nFor point A: (t\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (t\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24 = 1\n\nSimilarly, for point B: (s\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (s\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 = 1\n\nSo, let's write these as:\n\nt\u00b2 [ (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ] = 1\n\ns\u00b2 [ (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ] = 1\n\nLet me denote the coefficients as:\n\nFor t\u00b2: let\u2019s call it K = (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24\n\nFor s\u00b2: M = (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24\n\nSo, K = (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24\n\nM = (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 = - [ (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 ] = - [ (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 ]\n\nWait, perhaps I can express K and M in terms of each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a relationship between K and M.\n\nWait, K = (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24\n\nM = (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24\n\nLet me compute K + M:\n\nK + M = [ (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ] + [ (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ]\n\n= (cos\u00b2\u03b8)(1/20 - 1/24) + (sin\u00b2\u03b8)( -1/24 + 1/20 )\n\nCompute the coefficients:\n\n1/20 - 1/24 = (6/120 - 5/120) = 1/120\n\nSimilarly, -1/24 + 1/20 = (-5/120 + 6/120) = 1/120\n\nSo, K + M = (cos\u00b2\u03b8)(1/120) + (sin\u00b2\u03b8)(1/120 ) = (cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8)/120 = 1/120\n\nSo, K + M = 1/120\n\nBut from earlier, we have K = 1/t\u00b2 and M = 1/s\u00b2.\n\nWait, no. From the equations:\n\nK * t\u00b2 = 1 => t\u00b2 = 1/K\n\nSimilarly, M * s\u00b2 = 1 => s\u00b2 = 1/M\n\nSo, K + M = 1/120\n\nBut 1/K + 1/M = t\u00b2 + s\u00b2\n\nWait, but we have:\n\nt\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = (side)^2, but perhaps not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express t\u00b2 and s\u00b2 in terms of K and M.\n\nWait, t\u00b2 = 1/K and s\u00b2 = 1/M.\n\nSo, t\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = 1/K + 1/M\n\nBut K + M = 1/120\n\nHmm, maybe I can write 1/K + 1/M as (M + K)/(K*M) = (1/120)/(K*M)\n\nSo, t\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = (1/120)/(K*M)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express K*M.\n\nCompute K*M:\n\nK*M = [ (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ] [ (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ]\n\nThis looks messy, but perhaps I can compute it.\n\nLet me denote u = cos\u00b2\u03b8 and v = sin\u00b2\u03b8, so that u + v =1.\n\nThen,\n\nK = (u)/20 - (v)/24\n\nM = (v)/20 - (u)/24\n\nSo,\n\nK = (12u - 5v)/120\n\nM = (12v - 5u)/120\n\nSo,\n\nK*M = [ (12u -5v)(12v -5u) ] / (120)^2\n\nLet me compute numerator:\n\n(12u -5v)(12v -5u) = 12u*12v + 12u*(-5u) + (-5v)*12v + (-5v)*(-5u)\n\n= 144uv -60u\u00b2 -60v\u00b2 +25uv\n\n= (144uv +25uv) -60u\u00b2 -60v\u00b2\n\n= 169uv -60(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)\n\nBut since u + v =1, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = (u + v)^2 - 2uv = 1 - 2uv\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n169uv -60(1 - 2uv) = 169uv -60 +120uv = (169uv +120uv) -60 = 289uv -60\n\nSo, K*M = (289uv -60)/(120)^2\n\nBut uv = cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nWhich is (1/4) sin\u00b2(2\u03b8), since sin(2\u03b8) = 2 sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8, so sin\u00b2(2\u03b8) =4 sin\u00b2\u03b8 cos\u00b2\u03b8, so sin\u00b2\u03b8 cos\u00b2\u03b8 = (1/4) sin\u00b2(2\u03b8)\n\nSo, uv = (1/4) sin\u00b2(2\u03b8)\n\nThus, K*M = [289*(1/4) sin\u00b2(2\u03b8) -60 ] / (14400 )\n\n= [ (289/4) sin\u00b2(2\u03b8) -60 ] / 14400\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can proceed.\n\nWe know that t\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = (side)^2, but I'm not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nWait, but earlier, from the hyperbola equations:\n\nt\u00b2 = 1/K = 120 / (12u -5v )\n\nSimilarly, s\u00b2 = 1/M = 120 / (12v -5u )\n\nSo, t\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = 120/(12u -5v) + 120/(12v -5u )\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n= 120 [ 1/(12u -5v) + 1/(12v -5u) ]\n\n= 120 [ (12v -5u +12u -5v ) / ( (12u -5v)(12v -5u) ) ]\n\n= 120 [ (7u +7v ) / ( (12u -5v)(12v -5u) ) ]\n\n= 120 *7*(u + v) / (denominator )\n\nBut u + v =1, so:\n\n= 120 *7*1 / (denominator )\n\nDenominator is (12u -5v)(12v -5u ) which earlier was 289uv -60, from K*M.\n\nWait, no, earlier we had:\n\n(12u -5v)(12v -5u ) = 289uv -60\n\nSo, denominator =289uv -60\n\nSo, t\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = 120 *7 / (289uv -60 )\n\nBut t\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = 1/K + 1/M = 120/(12u -5v ) + 120/(12v -5u )\n\nWait, but we already used that to get to this point.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nLet me think about parametric equations of the hyperbola. For hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2=1, a parametrization can be (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8) or (a cosh t, b sinh t). Maybe using hyperbola parametrization would help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinates (x, y) and (-x, -y) for points A and C, and (y, -x) and (-y, x) for points B and D, but that might not necessarily lie on the hyperbola unless specific conditions are met.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Since the rhombus is centered at the origin and the diagonals are perpendicular, the points can be represented as (p, q), (-p, -q), (r, s), (-r, -s), with the condition that (p, q) and (r, s) are such that the vectors (p, q) and (r, s) are perpendicular.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the vectors along the diagonals are perpendicular. So, if one diagonal is along (p, q), the other is along (r, s), and their dot product is zero: pr + qs =0.\n\nBut all four points lie on the hyperbola, so:\n\nFor (p, q): p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1\n\nFor (r, s): r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 =1\n\nAlso, since it's a rhombus, the four points form a rhombus, so the distance from (p, q) to (r, s) should be equal to the distance from (r, s) to (-p, -q), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps using the condition that all sides are equal.\n\nWait, let me think in terms of vectors. Let me denote vectors OA = (p, q), OB = (r, s). Then, the rhombus has vertices at A, B, C, D where C = -A and D = -B.\n\nSo, the vectors OA and OB must satisfy that the sides AB, BC, etc., are equal.\n\nWait, the side AB is from A to B: vector OB - OA = (r-p, s - q). The length squared is (r-p)^2 + (s - q)^2.\n\nSimilarly, side BC is from B to C: vector OC - OB = (-p - r, -q - s). The length squared is ( -p - r )^2 + (-q - s)^2 = (p + r)^2 + (q + s)^2.\n\nSince all sides are equal, AB^2 = BC^2.\n\nSo,\n\n(r - p)^2 + (s - q)^2 = (p + r)^2 + (q + s)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft: r\u00b2 - 2pr + p\u00b2 + s\u00b2 - 2sq + q\u00b2\n\nRight: p\u00b2 + 2pr + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2sq + s\u00b2\n\nSet equal:\n\nr\u00b2 -2pr + p\u00b2 + s\u00b2 -2sq + q\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + 2pr + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2sq + s\u00b2\n\nSubtracting the right side from both sides:\n\n-4pr -4sq =0\n\nSo, -4(pr + sq)=0 => pr + sq=0\n\nWhich is the condition that vectors OA and OB are perpendicular, as expected because the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nSo, that condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, the rhombus is defined by two points (p, q) and (r, s) such that pr + sq=0, and both (p, q) and (r, s) lie on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding such points (p, q) and (r, s) on the hyperbola with pr + sq =0, and then finding BD^2, which would be the square of the length of diagonal BD.\n\nWait, BD is the diagonal connecting points B and D, which are (r, s) and (-r, -s). So, the length of BD is the distance between (r, s) and (-r, -s), which is sqrt[ (2r)^2 + (2s)^2 ] = 2*sqrt(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2). So, BD^2 = (2*sqrt(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2))^2 =4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD^2 is 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2). We need to find the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi. So, the infimum of BD^2 over all possible such rhombi.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of the lower bounds. So, the minimal possible value of BD\u00b2 across all possible rhombi, because the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should confirm that. Wait, if I'm to find the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because BD\u00b2 can take various values, and we need the maximum lower bound that is less than all BD\u00b2. So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should think in terms of minimal possible BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, let's express BD\u00b2 as 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2). So, we need to find the minimal value of (r\u00b2 + s\u00b2) given that (p, q) and (r, s) lie on the hyperbola and pr + sq=0.\n\nBut from the hyperbola equations:\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1\n\nr\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 =1\n\nAnd pr + sq=0.\n\nSo, we can model this as an optimization problem. Let me denote S = r\u00b2 + s\u00b2. We need to find the minimal S.\n\nBut since pr + sq =0, perhaps we can express one variable in terms of the others.\n\nLet me try to express s in terms of r, p, q.\n\nFrom pr + sq=0,\n\ns = - (pr)/q\n\nBut this might complicate things, especially since q can be zero, but on the hyperbola, when q=0, p\u00b2/20 =1 => p=\u00b1\u221a20, so points (\u221a20, 0) and (-\u221a20, 0). But if q=0, then from pr + sq=0, pr=0. So, either p=0 or r=0. But p can't be zero on the hyperbola because p\u00b2/20=1 would imply p=\u00b1\u221a20, which is non-zero. So, r must be zero if q=0. But r=0 would imply s\u00b2/24=1 from the hyperbola equation, so s=\u00b1\u221a24. But then the point (0, s) is on the hyperbola, so that's possible. Wait, but if r=0, then s=\u00b1\u221a24, and from pr + sq=0, since r=0, that equation becomes 0 + s q =0 => s q=0. But s=\u00b1\u221a24 \u22600, so q must be zero. So, in that case, the points would be (p, 0) and (0, s), with p=\u00b1\u221a20, s=\u00b1\u221a24. So, in that case, the rhombus would have diagonals along the axes, with lengths 2p and 2s, so BD^2 would be (2s)^2 =4s\u00b2=4*24=96.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the minimal value. Let me check another case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use Lagrange multipliers to minimize S = r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 subject to the constraints:\n\nr\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 =1,\n\npr + sq=0,\n\nand p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nBut this seems complicated because it's a system with multiple variables. Maybe I can relate p and r via the constraint pr + sq=0.\n\nWait, from pr + sq=0, and knowing that (p, q) and (r, s) are on the hyperbola, perhaps I can find a relationship between them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parameterize the points.\n\nLet me try to express (p, q) as (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), where a=\u221a20, b=\u221a24.\n\nSimilarly, (r, s) can be expressed as (a sec\u03c6, b tan\u03c6).\n\nBut since pr + sq=0,\n\na sec\u03b8 * a sec\u03c6 + b tan\u03b8 * b tan\u03c6 =0\n\n=> a\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be simplified.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\na\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0\n\nDivide both sides by cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6:\n\na\u00b2 (1/cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) + b\u00b2 (sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8)(sin\u03c6/cos\u03c6) ) =0\n\n= a\u00b2 / (cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) + b\u00b2 (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) ) =0\n\nCombine terms:\n\n[ a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 ] / (cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) ) =0\n\nSo, numerator must be zero:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 =0\n\n=> sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -a\u00b2 / b\u00b2\n\nBut a\u00b2=20, b\u00b2=24, so:\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -20/24 = -5/6\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6\n\nHmm, that's a useful relationship.\n\nNow, we can express S = r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6\n\nBecause r = a sec\u03c6, s = b tan\u03c6.\n\nSimilarly, from the hyperbola equation, r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24=1 => (a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6)/20 - (b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6)/24=1, which is consistent with a\u00b2=20, b\u00b2=24.\n\nSo, S = a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6\n\nLet me express this in terms of sin\u03c6 and cos\u03c6.\n\nWe know that sec\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6, so:\n\nS = a\u00b2 (1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) + b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6\n\n= a\u00b2 + (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) tan\u00b2\u03c6\n\nSo, S = a\u00b2 + (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) tan\u00b2\u03c6\n\nWe can express tan\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03b8 and sin\u03c6.\n\nFrom earlier, we have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut perhaps we can find tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nWe can write tan\u00b2\u03c6 = (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(cos\u00b2\u03c6) = (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6)\n\nBut from sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, perhaps we can relate sin\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relationship to express tan\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express tan\u03b8 in terms of tan\u03c6.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: Let me consider that we have two points (p, q) and (r, s) on the hyperbola such that pr + sq=0. We can model this as a system of equations and find S in terms of a single variable.\n\nBut maybe it's better to express S in terms of tan\u03c6, as I did earlier.\n\nSo, S = a\u00b2 + (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) tan\u00b2\u03c6\n\nWe need to find the minimal S. So, to minimize S, we need to minimize tan\u00b2\u03c6, since a\u00b2 is a constant.\n\nBut tan\u00b2\u03c6 can't be negative, so the minimal value would be when tan\u00b2\u03c6 is as small as possible, but subject to the constraint sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWait, but tan\u00b2\u03c6 can be expressed in terms of sin\u03c6 and cos\u03c6, which might relate to the constraint.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express tan\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03c6.\n\nLet me let t = tan\u03c6, so that tan\u00b2\u03c6 = t\u00b2.\n\nThen, sin\u03c6 = t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2), and cos\u03c6 = 1 / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nFrom the constraint, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut I don't know sin\u03b8 in terms of t. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate sin\u03b8 and sin\u03c6 through the constraint.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express sin\u03b8 in terms of sin\u03c6.\n\nFrom sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6,\n\nsin\u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03c6 )\n\nBut sin\u03b8 must be between -1 and 1, so | (-5)/(6 sin\u03c6 ) | <=1\n\nWhich implies |5/(6 sin\u03c6)| <=1 => |sin\u03c6| >=5/6\n\nSo, |sin\u03c6| >=5/6.\n\nThus, sin\u03c6 >=5/6 or sin\u03c6 <=-5/6.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of |sin\u03c6| is 5/6.\n\nSo, sin\u03c6 = 5/6 or sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWait, but if |sin\u03c6| >=5/6, then the minimal possible |sin\u03c6| is 5/6.\n\nSo, the minimal S would occur when |sin\u03c6| is minimized, i.e., when |sin\u03c6|=5/6.\n\nBecause as |sin\u03c6| increases beyond 5/6, tan\u00b2\u03c6 increases, leading to a larger S.\n\nWait, but when |sin\u03c6|=5/6, then tan\u03c6 = sqrt(1 - (25/36)) / (5/6) )= sqrt(11/36) / (5/6) )= (sqrt(11)/6)/(5/6) )= sqrt(11)/5.\n\nSo, tan\u00b2\u03c6 = 11/25.\n\nThus, S = a\u00b2 + (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)* (11/25 )\n\nCompute a\u00b2=20, b\u00b2=24.\n\nSo,\n\nS = 20 + (20 +24)*(11/25) =20 + 44*(11/25) =20 + (484/25) =20 + 19.36=39.36\n\nWait, 44*11=484, yes.\n\nWait, 44*11=484, 484/25=19.36, 20+19.36=39.36, which is 39.36.\n\nBut 39.36 is 984/25, since 984 \u00f725 is 39.36.\n\nWait, 25*39=975, 984-975=9, so 984/25=39 9/25=39.36.\n\nSo, S=984/25.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2=4S=4*(984/25)=3936/25=157.44.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought when the points are on the axes, BD\u00b2 would be 96, which is less than 157.44. So, this can't be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reasoning. Because when |sin\u03c6|=5/6, that's the minimal |sin\u03c6| allowed by the constraint. But perhaps the minimal S occurs when |sin\u03c6| is as small as possible, which is 5/6, leading to the minimal S. But in that case, BD\u00b2=4S=4*(984/25)=3936/25=157.44.\n\nBut earlier, when the points are on the axes, BD\u00b2=96, which is smaller than 157.44. So, that suggests that the minimal BD\u00b2 is 96, and the maximal minimal BD\u00b2 is 96. So, perhaps the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 96.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation gave BD\u00b2=157.44 when |sin\u03c6|=5/6, which is larger than 96. So, that suggests that BD\u00b2 can be as low as 96 and as high as something larger.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 96, because BD\u00b2 can be as small as 96, but not smaller. So, 96 is the minimal possible BD\u00b2, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 96.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. When the points are on the axes, we have BD\u00b2=96, which is the minimal possible. But in that case, the other diagonal AC would have length 2p=2\u221a20, so AC\u00b2=(2\u221a20)^2=80. Then, in a rhombus, the area is (AC * BD)/2, which would be (sqrt(80) * sqrt(96))/2.\n\nWait, but perhaps that's a digression.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if when the points are on the axes, the rhombus is actually a valid one.\n\nSo, points A=(\u221a20, 0), C=(-\u221a20, 0), B=(0, \u221a24), D=(0, -\u221a24).\n\nThen, the sides would be AB, BC, CD, DA.\n\nCompute AB: distance between (\u221a20,0) and (0,\u221a24).\n\nAB\u00b2= (\u221a20)^2 + (\u221a24)^2=20 +24=44.\n\nSimilarly, BC\u00b2= (\u221a20)^2 + (\u221a24)^2=44, etc. So, all sides are equal, so it is a rhombus. So, BD\u00b2= (2\u221a24)^2=4*24=96.\n\nSo, in this case, BD\u00b2=96.\n\nEarlier, when I considered |sin\u03c6|=5/6, which leads to BD\u00b2=157.44, which is larger than 96. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 96, and the maximal BD\u00b2 can be larger. But the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, which would be the infimum, which is 96.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure that 96 is indeed the minimal possible BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, when the points are on the axes, BD\u00b2=96, and that's the minimal because any other rhombus would have BD\u00b2 larger than that.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm wrong. Let me consider another configuration.\n\nSuppose that points A and B are not on the axes. Let me see if BD\u00b2 can be smaller than 96.\n\nWait, but from the earlier analysis, when |sin\u03c6| is minimized at 5/6, we get BD\u00b2=157.44, which is larger than 96. So, perhaps 96 is indeed the minimal value.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again about the constraint.\n\nWe have from the hyperbola equations and the condition pr + sq=0.\n\nWhen points are on the axes, as in A=(\u221a20,0), B=(0,\u221a24), we have pr + sq=\u221a20*0 + 0*\u221a24=0, which satisfies the condition.\n\nBut when points are not on the axes, we have to satisfy pr + sq=0, which imposes a relationship between the points.\n\nWait, but in the earlier parametrization, I found that when |sin\u03c6|=5/6, BD\u00b2=157.44, which is larger than 96.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is indeed 96, achieved when the rhombus is aligned with the axes.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 96.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2 across all possible rhombi. Since the minimal BD\u00b2 is 96, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 96, because for any number greater than 96, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2=96, so that number would not be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Therefore, the answer is 96.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more.\n\nIf the minimal BD\u00b2 is 96, then any number less than 96 would not be the greatest possible, since 96 is achievable. But the question asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 can be as low as 96, then the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is 96, because for any number greater than 96, there's a rhombus where BD\u00b2=96, so that number is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Therefore, the answer is 96.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if the minimal BD\u00b2 is 96, then 96 is the lower bound. So, the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would be 96, because for any number greater than 96, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2=96, making that number not less than BD\u00b2 for that rhombus.\n\nWait, no, that's the opposite. If we want a number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, then the greatest such number would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because for any number greater than the infimum, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than that number, making it not a lower bound. But the infimum itself is the greatest lower bound, so it's the largest number that is less than or equal to all BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but in this case, the infimum is 96, and there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2=96, so 96 is the greatest number that is less than or equal to all BD\u00b2. But the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if 96 is achievable, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 96, because for any number greater than 96, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2=96, so that number is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Therefore, the answer is 96.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. The problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of all lower bounds for BD\u00b2. Since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 96, any number less than 96 would not be the greatest lower bound. So, the greatest lower bound is 96, which is the infimum. Therefore, the answer is 96.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider another case where BD\u00b2 is exactly 96, and see if that's indeed the minimal.\n\nYes, when the rhombus is aligned with the axes, BD\u00b2=96, and any other rhombus would have BD\u00b2 larger than that. So, 96 is the minimal possible BD\u00b2, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 96.\n\nWait, but in the earlier parametrization, when |sin\u03c6|=5/6, we get BD\u00b2=157.44, which is larger than 96. So, that suggests that 96 is indeed the minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 96.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nThe hyperbola is given by the equation (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1. So that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis. The standard form is (x\u00b2/a\u00b2) - (y\u00b2/b\u00b2) = 1, so here a\u00b2=20 and b\u00b2=24. Therefore, a=\u221a20 and b=\u221a24. Simplifying, a is 2\u221a5 and b is 2\u221a6.\n\nNow, the problem mentions points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola such that ABCD is a rhombus. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the rhombus is symmetric about the origin, meaning that if a point (x, y) is on the hyperbola, then the point (-x, -y) is also on the hyperbola, which is true because substituting (-x, -y) into the equation gives the same result.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: In a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Hmm, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me recall: Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, they intersect at right angles and bisect each other.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense. So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, and its diagonals are along the coordinate axes or some other lines, but they must be perpendicular.\n\nLet me think about the properties. Let's denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Since diagonals intersect at the origin, and ABCD is a rhombus, then points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other. Because in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.\n\nSo, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D is (-p, -q). So, all four points are on the hyperbola.\n\nNow, in a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distances AB, BC, CD, DA are all equal.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, perhaps we can use the slopes of the diagonals to find some relationships.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to parameterize the points.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, and in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular.\n\nSo, the diagonals are perpendicular lines passing through the origin, intersecting at the origin. So, if AC is along a line with slope m, then BD must be along a line with slope -1/m, since they are perpendicular.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's easier to model the points as lying on lines through the origin. Let me consider points A and C lying along one line, and points B and D lying along another line, perpendicular to the first.\n\nSo, suppose that diagonal AC lies along a line making an angle \u03b8 with the x-axis, and diagonal BD lies along a line making an angle \u03b8 + 90 degrees (since they are perpendicular).\n\nThen, points A and C can be written in terms of some parameter, say, t, as (t cos\u03b8, t sin\u03b8), and (-t cos\u03b8, -t sin\u03b8). Similarly, points B and D can be written as (s cos(\u03b8 + 90\u00b0), s sin(\u03b8 + 90\u00b0)) which simplifies to (-s sin\u03b8, s cos\u03b8), and (s sin\u03b8, -s cos\u03b8).\n\nWait, perhaps that's a way to parameterize the points.\n\nBut since all four points lie on the hyperbola, substituting their coordinates into the hyperbola equation will give us conditions on t and s.\n\nSo, let's write that.\n\nFor point A: (t cos\u03b8, t sin\u03b8) must satisfy (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSo,\n\n(t cos\u03b8)\u00b2 / 20 - (t sin\u03b8)^2 /24 = 1\n\nSimilarly, for point B: (-s sin\u03b8, s cos\u03b8) must satisfy:\n\n(-s sin\u03b8)^2 /20 - (s cos\u03b8)^2 /24 = 1\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(s\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (s\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 = 1\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) (t\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (t\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24 = 1\n\n2) (s\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (s\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 = 1\n\nNow, let's see if we can relate t and s.\n\nBut since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. Let's compute the distance between points A and B, which should be equal to the distance between B and C, etc.\n\nWait, but perhaps another approach is to note that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and satisfy the relationship: (diagonal1)^2 + (diagonal2)^2 = 4*(side)^2.\n\nBut in this case, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, if AC has length 2t and BD has length 2s, then:\n\n(2t)^2 + (2s)^2 = 4*(side)^2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n4t\u00b2 + 4s\u00b2 = 4*(side)^2\n\nSo, t\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = (side)^2.\n\nAlternatively, since all sides are equal, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C.\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nCompute distance AB:\n\nA is (t cos\u03b8, t sin\u03b8)\n\nB is (-s sin\u03b8, s cos\u03b8)\n\nSo, AB^2 = [ (-s sin\u03b8 - t cos\u03b8)^2 + (s cos\u03b8 - t sin\u03b8)^2 ]\n\nSimilarly, compute BC^2:\n\nB is (-s sin\u03b8, s cos\u03b8)\n\nC is (-t cos\u03b8, -t sin\u03b8)\n\nSo, BC^2 = [ (-t cos\u03b8 + s sin\u03b8)^2 + (-t sin\u03b8 - s cos\u03b8)^2 ]\n\nSince AB = BC, their squares should be equal:\n\n[ (-s sin\u03b8 - t cos\u03b8)^2 + (s cos\u03b8 - t sin\u03b8)^2 ] = [ (-t cos\u03b8 + s sin\u03b8)^2 + (-t sin\u03b8 - s cos\u03b8)^2 ]\n\nLet me compute both sides.\n\nLeft Side:\n\n(-s sin\u03b8 - t cos\u03b8)^2 = (s sin\u03b8 + t cos\u03b8)^2 = s\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + t\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8\n\n(s cos\u03b8 - t sin\u03b8)^2 = s\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8 - 2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + t\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nAdding these together:\n\ns\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + t\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8 + s\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8 - 2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + t\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nSimplify:\n\ns\u00b2 (sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8) + t\u00b2 (cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8) + (2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 - 2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 )\n\nWhich simplifies to s\u00b2 + t\u00b2, since sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1 and the cross terms cancel.\n\nRight Side:\n\n(-t cos\u03b8 + s sin\u03b8)^2 = t\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8 - 2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + s\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\n(-t sin\u03b8 - s cos\u03b8)^2 = t\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + s\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8\n\nAdding these together:\n\nt\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8 - 2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + s\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + t\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + s\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8\n\nSimplify:\n\nt\u00b2 (cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8) + s\u00b2 (sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8) + (-2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + 2st sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 )\n\nAgain, this simplifies to t\u00b2 + s\u00b2.\n\nSo, both sides equal t\u00b2 + s\u00b2, so the equation holds. So, that condition is satisfied. So, no new information there.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I need another condition to relate t and s.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can use the hyperbola equations.\n\nFrom earlier, we had:\n\nFor point A: (t\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (t\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24 = 1\n\nSimilarly, for point B: (s\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (s\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 = 1\n\nSo, let's write these as:\n\nt\u00b2 [ (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ] = 1\n\ns\u00b2 [ (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ] = 1\n\nLet me denote the coefficients as:\n\nFor t\u00b2: let\u2019s call it K = (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24\n\nFor s\u00b2: M = (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24\n\nSo, K = (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24\n\nM = (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 = - [ (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 ] = - [ (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 ]\n\nWait, perhaps I can express K and M in terms of each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a relationship between K and M.\n\nWait, K = (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24\n\nM = (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24\n\nLet me compute K + M:\n\nK + M = [ (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ] + [ (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ]\n\n= (cos\u00b2\u03b8)(1/20 - 1/24) + (sin\u00b2\u03b8)( -1/24 + 1/20 )\n\nCompute the coefficients:\n\n1/20 - 1/24 = (6/120 - 5/120) = 1/120\n\nSimilarly, -1/24 + 1/20 = (-5/120 + 6/120) = 1/120\n\nSo, K + M = (cos\u00b2\u03b8)(1/120) + (sin\u00b2\u03b8)(1/120 ) = (cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8)/120 = 1/120\n\nSo, K + M = 1/120\n\nBut from earlier, we have K = 1/t\u00b2 and M = 1/s\u00b2.\n\nWait, no. From the equations:\n\nK * t\u00b2 = 1 => t\u00b2 = 1/K\n\nSimilarly, M * s\u00b2 = 1 => s\u00b2 = 1/M\n\nSo, K + M = 1/120\n\nBut 1/K + 1/M = t\u00b2 + s\u00b2\n\nWait, but we have:\n\nt\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = (side)^2, but perhaps not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express t\u00b2 and s\u00b2 in terms of K and M.\n\nWait, t\u00b2 = 1/K and s\u00b2 = 1/M.\n\nSo, t\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = 1/K + 1/M\n\nBut K + M = 1/120\n\nHmm, maybe I can write 1/K + 1/M as (M + K)/(K*M) = (1/120)/(K*M)\n\nSo, t\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = (1/120)/(K*M)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express K*M.\n\nCompute K*M:\n\nK*M = [ (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ] [ (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/20 - (cos\u00b2\u03b8)/24 ]\n\nThis looks messy, but perhaps I can compute it.\n\nLet me denote u = cos\u00b2\u03b8 and v = sin\u00b2\u03b8, so that u + v =1.\n\nThen,\n\nK = (u)/20 - (v)/24\n\nM = (v)/20 - (u)/24\n\nSo,\n\nK = (12u - 5v)/120\n\nM = (12v - 5u)/120\n\nSo,\n\nK*M = [ (12u -5v)(12v -5u) ] / (120)^2\n\nLet me compute numerator:\n\n(12u -5v)(12v -5u) = 12u*12v + 12u*(-5u) + (-5v)*12v + (-5v)*(-5u)\n\n= 144uv -60u\u00b2 -60v\u00b2 +25uv\n\n= (144uv +25uv) -60u\u00b2 -60v\u00b2\n\n= 169uv -60(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)\n\nBut since u + v =1, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = (u + v)^2 - 2uv = 1 - 2uv\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n169uv -60(1 - 2uv) = 169uv -60 +120uv = (169uv +120uv) -60 = 289uv -60\n\nSo, K*M = (289uv -60)/(120)^2\n\nBut uv = cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nWhich is (1/4) sin\u00b2(2\u03b8), since sin(2\u03b8) = 2 sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8, so sin\u00b2(2\u03b8) =4 sin\u00b2\u03b8 cos\u00b2\u03b8, so sin\u00b2\u03b8 cos\u00b2\u03b8 = (1/4) sin\u00b2(2\u03b8)\n\nSo, uv = (1/4) sin\u00b2(2\u03b8)\n\nThus, K*M = [289*(1/4) sin\u00b2(2\u03b8) -60 ] / (14400 )\n\n= [ (289/4) sin\u00b2(2\u03b8) -60 ] / 14400\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can proceed.\n\nWe know that t\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = (side)^2, but I'm not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nWait, but earlier, from the hyperbola equations:\n\nt\u00b2 = 1/K = 120 / (12u -5v )\n\nSimilarly, s\u00b2 = 1/M = 120 / (12v -5u )\n\nSo, t\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = 120/(12u -5v) + 120/(12v -5u )\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n= 120 [ 1/(12u -5v) + 1/(12v -5u) ]\n\n= 120 [ (12v -5u +12u -5v ) / ( (12u -5v)(12v -5u) ) ]\n\n= 120 [ (7u +7v ) / ( (12u -5v)(12v -5u) ) ]\n\n= 120 *7*(u + v) / (denominator )\n\nBut u + v =1, so:\n\n= 120 *7*1 / (denominator )\n\nDenominator is (12u -5v)(12v -5u ) which earlier was 289uv -60, from K*M.\n\nWait, no, earlier we had:\n\n(12u -5v)(12v -5u ) = 289uv -60\n\nSo, denominator =289uv -60\n\nSo, t\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = 120 *7 / (289uv -60 )\n\nBut t\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = 1/K + 1/M = 120/(12u -5v ) + 120/(12v -5u )\n\nWait, but we already used that to get to this point.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nLet me think about parametric equations of the hyperbola. For hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2=1, a parametrization can be (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8) or (a cosh t, b sinh t). Maybe using hyperbola parametrization would help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinates (x, y) and (-x, -y) for points A and C, and (y, -x) and (-y, x) for points B and D, but that might not necessarily lie on the hyperbola unless specific conditions are met.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Since the rhombus is centered at the origin and the diagonals are perpendicular, the points can be represented as (p, q), (-p, -q), (r, s), (-r, -s), with the condition that (p, q) and (r, s) are such that the vectors (p, q) and (r, s) are perpendicular.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the vectors along the diagonals are perpendicular. So, if one diagonal is along (p, q), the other is along (r, s), and their dot product is zero: pr + qs =0.\n\nBut all four points lie on the hyperbola, so:\n\nFor (p, q): p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1\n\nFor (r, s): r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 =1\n\nAlso, since it's a rhombus, the four points form a rhombus, so the distance from (p, q) to (r, s) should be equal to the distance from (r, s) to (-p, -q), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps using the condition that all sides are equal.\n\nWait, let me think in terms of vectors. Let me denote vectors OA = (p, q), OB = (r, s). Then, the rhombus has vertices at A, B, C, D where C = -A and D = -B.\n\nSo, the vectors OA and OB must satisfy that the sides AB, BC, etc., are equal.\n\nWait, the side AB is from A to B: vector OB - OA = (r-p, s - q). The length squared is (r-p)^2 + (s - q)^2.\n\nSimilarly, side BC is from B to C: vector OC - OB = (-p - r, -q - s). The length squared is ( -p - r )^2 + (-q - s)^2 = (p + r)^2 + (q + s)^2.\n\nSince all sides are equal, AB^2 = BC^2.\n\nSo,\n\n(r - p)^2 + (s - q)^2 = (p + r)^2 + (q + s)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft: r\u00b2 - 2pr + p\u00b2 + s\u00b2 - 2sq + q\u00b2\n\nRight: p\u00b2 + 2pr + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2sq + s\u00b2\n\nSet equal:\n\nr\u00b2 -2pr + p\u00b2 + s\u00b2 -2sq + q\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + 2pr + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2sq + s\u00b2\n\nSubtracting the right side from both sides:\n\n-4pr -4sq =0\n\nSo, -4(pr + sq)=0 => pr + sq=0\n\nWhich is the condition that vectors OA and OB are perpendicular, as expected because the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nSo, that condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, the rhombus is defined by two points (p, q) and (r, s) such that pr + sq=0, and both (p, q) and (r, s) lie on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding such points (p, q) and (r, s) on the hyperbola with pr + sq =0, and then finding BD^2, which would be the square of the length of diagonal BD.\n\nWait, BD is the diagonal connecting points B and D, which are (r, s) and (-r, -s). So, the length of BD is the distance between (r, s) and (-r, -s), which is sqrt[ (2r)^2 + (2s)^2 ] = 2*sqrt(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2). So, BD^2 = (2*sqrt(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2))^2 =4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD^2 is 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2). We need to find the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi. So, the infimum of BD^2 over all possible such rhombi.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of the lower bounds. So, the minimal possible value of BD\u00b2 across all possible rhombi, because the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should confirm that. Wait, if I'm to find the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because BD\u00b2 can take various values, and we need the maximum lower bound that is less than all BD\u00b2. So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should think in terms of minimal possible BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, let's express BD\u00b2 as 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2). So, we need to find the minimal value of (r\u00b2 + s\u00b2) given that (p, q) and (r, s) lie on the hyperbola and pr + sq=0.\n\nBut from the hyperbola equations:\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1\n\nr\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 =1\n\nAnd pr + sq=0.\n\nSo, we can model this as an optimization problem. Let me denote S = r\u00b2 + s\u00b2. We need to find the minimal S.\n\nBut since pr + sq =0, perhaps we can express one variable in terms of the others.\n\nLet me try to express s in terms of r, p, q.\n\nFrom pr + sq=0,\n\ns = - (pr)/q\n\nBut this might complicate things, especially since q can be zero, but on the hyperbola, when q=0, p\u00b2/20 =1 => p=\u00b1\u221a20, so points (\u221a20, 0) and (-\u221a20, 0). But if q=0, then from pr + sq=0, pr=0. So, either p=0 or r=0. But p can't be zero on the hyperbola because p\u00b2/20=1 would imply p=\u00b1\u221a20, which is non-zero. So, r must be zero if q=0. But r=0 would imply s\u00b2/24=1 from the hyperbola equation, so s=\u00b1\u221a24. But then the point (0, s) is on the hyperbola, so that's possible. Wait, but if r=0, then s=\u00b1\u221a24, and from pr + sq=0, since r=0, that equation becomes 0 + s q =0 => s q=0. But s=\u00b1\u221a24 \u22600, so q must be zero. So, in that case, the points would be (p, 0) and (0, s), with p=\u00b1\u221a20, s=\u00b1\u221a24. So, in that case, the rhombus would have diagonals along the axes, with lengths 2p and 2s, so BD^2 would be (2s)^2 =4s\u00b2=4*24=96.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the minimal value. Let me check another case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use Lagrange multipliers to minimize S = r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 subject to the constraints:\n\nr\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 =1,\n\npr + sq=0,\n\nand p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nBut this seems complicated because it's a system with multiple variables. Maybe I can relate p and r via the constraint pr + sq=0.\n\nWait, from pr + sq=0, and knowing that (p, q) and (r, s) are on the hyperbola, perhaps I can find a relationship between them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parameterize the points.\n\nLet me try to express (p, q) as (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), where a=\u221a20, b=\u221a24.\n\nSimilarly, (r, s) can be expressed as (a sec\u03c6, b tan\u03c6).\n\nBut since pr + sq=0,\n\na sec\u03b8 * a sec\u03c6 + b tan\u03b8 * b tan\u03c6 =0\n\n=> a\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be simplified.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\na\u00b2 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0\n\nDivide both sides by cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6:\n\na\u00b2 (1/cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) + b\u00b2 (sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8)(sin\u03c6/cos\u03c6) ) =0\n\n= a\u00b2 / (cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) + b\u00b2 (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) ) =0\n\nCombine terms:\n\n[ a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 ] / (cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) ) =0\n\nSo, numerator must be zero:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 =0\n\n=> sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -a\u00b2 / b\u00b2\n\nBut a\u00b2=20, b\u00b2=24, so:\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -20/24 = -5/6\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6\n\nHmm, that's a useful relationship.\n\nNow, we can express S = r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6\n\nBecause r = a sec\u03c6, s = b tan\u03c6.\n\nSimilarly, from the hyperbola equation, r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24=1 => (a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6)/20 - (b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6)/24=1, which is consistent with a\u00b2=20, b\u00b2=24.\n\nSo, S = a\u00b2 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6\n\nLet me express this in terms of sin\u03c6 and cos\u03c6.\n\nWe know that sec\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6, so:\n\nS = a\u00b2 (1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) + b\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6\n\n= a\u00b2 + (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) tan\u00b2\u03c6\n\nSo, S = a\u00b2 + (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) tan\u00b2\u03c6\n\nWe can express tan\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03b8 and sin\u03c6.\n\nFrom earlier, we have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut perhaps we can find tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nWe can write tan\u00b2\u03c6 = (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(cos\u00b2\u03c6) = (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6)\n\nBut from sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, perhaps we can relate sin\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relationship to express tan\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express tan\u03b8 in terms of tan\u03c6.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: Let me consider that we have two points (p, q) and (r, s) on the hyperbola such that pr + sq=0. We can model this as a system of equations and find S in terms of a single variable.\n\nBut maybe it's better to express S in terms of tan\u03c6, as I did earlier.\n\nSo, S = a\u00b2 + (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) tan\u00b2\u03c6\n\nWe need to find the minimal S. So, to minimize S, we need to minimize tan\u00b2\u03c6, since a\u00b2 is a constant.\n\nBut tan\u00b2\u03c6 can't be negative, so the minimal value would be when tan\u00b2\u03c6 is as small as possible, but subject to the constraint sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWait, but tan\u00b2\u03c6 can be expressed in terms of sin\u03c6 and cos\u03c6, which might relate to the constraint.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express tan\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03c6.\n\nLet me let t = tan\u03c6, so that tan\u00b2\u03c6 = t\u00b2.\n\nThen, sin\u03c6 = t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2), and cos\u03c6 = 1 / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nFrom the constraint, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut I don't know sin\u03b8 in terms of t. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate sin\u03b8 and sin\u03c6 through the constraint.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express sin\u03b8 in terms of sin\u03c6.\n\nFrom sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6,\n\nsin\u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03c6 )\n\nBut sin\u03b8 must be between -1 and 1, so | (-5)/(6 sin\u03c6 ) | <=1\n\nWhich implies |5/(6 sin\u03c6)| <=1 => |sin\u03c6| >=5/6\n\nSo, |sin\u03c6| >=5/6.\n\nThus, sin\u03c6 >=5/6 or sin\u03c6 <=-5/6.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of |sin\u03c6| is 5/6.\n\nSo, sin\u03c6 = 5/6 or sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWait, but if |sin\u03c6| >=5/6, then the minimal possible |sin\u03c6| is 5/6.\n\nSo, the minimal S would occur when |sin\u03c6| is minimized, i.e., when |sin\u03c6|=5/6.\n\nBecause as |sin\u03c6| increases beyond 5/6, tan\u00b2\u03c6 increases, leading to a larger S.\n\nWait, but when |sin\u03c6|=5/6, then tan\u03c6 = sqrt(1 - (25/36)) / (5/6) )= sqrt(11/36) / (5/6) )= (sqrt(11)/6)/(5/6) )= sqrt(11)/5.\n\nSo, tan\u00b2\u03c6 = 11/25.\n\nThus, S = a\u00b2 + (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)* (11/25 )\n\nCompute a\u00b2=20, b\u00b2=24.\n\nSo,\n\nS = 20 + (20 +24)*(11/25) =20 + 44*(11/25) =20 + (484/25) =20 + 19.36=39.36\n\nWait, 44*11=484, yes.\n\nWait, 44*11=484, 484/25=19.36, 20+19.36=39.36, which is 39.36.\n\nBut 39.36 is 984/25, since 984 \u00f725 is 39.36.\n\nWait, 25*39=975, 984-975=9, so 984/25=39 9/25=39.36.\n\nSo, S=984/25.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2=4S=4*(984/25)=3936/25=157.44.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought when the points are on the axes, BD\u00b2 would be 96, which is less than 157.44. So, this can't be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reasoning. Because when |sin\u03c6|=5/6, that's the minimal |sin\u03c6| allowed by the constraint. But perhaps the minimal S occurs when |sin\u03c6| is as small as possible, which is 5/6, leading to the minimal S. But in that case, BD\u00b2=4S=4*(984/25)=3936/25=157.44.\n\nBut earlier, when the points are on the axes, BD\u00b2=96, which is smaller than 157.44. So, that suggests that the minimal BD\u00b2 is 96, and the maximal minimal BD\u00b2 is 96. So, perhaps the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 96.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation gave BD\u00b2=157.44 when |sin\u03c6|=5/6, which is larger than 96. So, that suggests that BD\u00b2 can be as low as 96 and as high as something larger.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 96, because BD\u00b2 can be as small as 96, but not smaller. So, 96 is the minimal possible BD\u00b2, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 96.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. When the points are on the axes, we have BD\u00b2=96, which is the minimal possible. But in that case, the other diagonal AC would have length 2p=2\u221a20, so AC\u00b2=(2\u221a20)^2=80. Then, in a rhombus, the area is (AC * BD)/2, which would be (sqrt(80) * sqrt(96))/2.\n\nWait, but perhaps that's a digression.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if when the points are on the axes, the rhombus is actually a valid one.\n\nSo, points A=(\u221a20, 0), C=(-\u221a20, 0), B=(0, \u221a24), D=(0, -\u221a24).\n\nThen, the sides would be AB, BC, CD, DA.\n\nCompute AB: distance between (\u221a20,0) and (0,\u221a24).\n\nAB\u00b2= (\u221a20)^2 + (\u221a24)^2=20 +24=44.\n\nSimilarly, BC\u00b2= (\u221a20)^2 + (\u221a24)^2=44, etc. So, all sides are equal, so it is a rhombus. So, BD\u00b2= (2\u221a24)^2=4*24=96.\n\nSo, in this case, BD\u00b2=96.\n\nEarlier, when I considered |sin\u03c6|=5/6, which leads to BD\u00b2=157.44, which is larger than 96. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 96, and the maximal BD\u00b2 can be larger. But the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, which would be the infimum, which is 96.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure that 96 is indeed the minimal possible BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, when the points are on the axes, BD\u00b2=96, and that's the minimal because any other rhombus would have BD\u00b2 larger than that.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm wrong. Let me consider another configuration.\n\nSuppose that points A and B are not on the axes. Let me see if BD\u00b2 can be smaller than 96.\n\nWait, but from the earlier analysis, when |sin\u03c6| is minimized at 5/6, we get BD\u00b2=157.44, which is larger than 96. So, perhaps 96 is indeed the minimal value.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again about the constraint.\n\nWe have from the hyperbola equations and the condition pr + sq=0.\n\nWhen points are on the axes, as in A=(\u221a20,0), B=(0,\u221a24), we have pr + sq=\u221a20*0 + 0*\u221a24=0, which satisfies the condition.\n\nBut when points are not on the axes, we have to satisfy pr + sq=0, which imposes a relationship between the points.\n\nWait, but in the earlier parametrization, I found that when |sin\u03c6|=5/6, BD\u00b2=157.44, which is larger than 96.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is indeed 96, achieved when the rhombus is aligned with the axes.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 96.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2 across all possible rhombi. Since the minimal BD\u00b2 is 96, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 96, because for any number greater than 96, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2=96, so that number would not be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Therefore, the answer is 96.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more.\n\nIf the minimal BD\u00b2 is 96, then any number less than 96 would not be the greatest possible, since 96 is achievable. But the question asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 can be as low as 96, then the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is 96, because for any number greater than 96, there's a rhombus where BD\u00b2=96, so that number is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Therefore, the answer is 96.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if the minimal BD\u00b2 is 96, then 96 is the lower bound. So, the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would be 96, because for any number greater than 96, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2=96, making that number not less than BD\u00b2 for that rhombus.\n\nWait, no, that's the opposite. If we want a number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, then the greatest such number would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because for any number greater than the infimum, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than that number, making it not a lower bound. But the infimum itself is the greatest lower bound, so it's the largest number that is less than or equal to all BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but in this case, the infimum is 96, and there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2=96, so 96 is the greatest number that is less than or equal to all BD\u00b2. But the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if 96 is achievable, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 96, because for any number greater than 96, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2=96, so that number is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Therefore, the answer is 96.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. The problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of all lower bounds for BD\u00b2. Since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 96, any number less than 96 would not be the greatest lower bound. So, the greatest lower bound is 96, which is the infimum. Therefore, the answer is 96.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider another case where BD\u00b2 is exactly 96, and see if that's indeed the minimal.\n\nYes, when the rhombus is aligned with the axes, BD\u00b2=96, and any other rhombus would have BD\u00b2 larger than that. So, 96 is the minimal possible BD\u00b2, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 96.\n\nWait, but in the earlier parametrization, when |sin\u03c6|=5/6, we get BD\u00b2=157.44, which is larger than 96. So, that suggests that 96 is indeed the minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 96.\n\n\nThe problem involves a rhombus inscribed in the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The goal is to find the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombi.\n\n1. **Hyperbola Properties**: The hyperbola is centered at the origin with \\( a^2 = 20 \\) and \\( b^2 = 24 \\). Thus, \\( a = 2\\sqrt{5} \\) and \\( b = 2\\sqrt{6} \\).\n\n2. **Rhombus Properties**: In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

If \\( B = (r, s) \\), then \\( D = (-r, -s) \\), so \\( BD^2 = 4(r^2 + s^2) \\).\n\n5. **Minimizing \\( BD^2 \\)**: To find the minimal \\( BD^2 \\), consider the case where the rhombus is aligned with the axes.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I'm looking for the infimum of BD\u00b2, the lower bound of BD squared, such that it's the largest number that doesn't exceed BD\u00b2 for any possible rhombus satisfying the conditions.\n\nFirst, let's recall some properties of a rhombus. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Yes, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, and each diagonal bisects the other.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if I denote the diagonals as AC and BD, then points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and points B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the origin is the midpoint, the coordinates of C would be the negative of A, and similarly, D would be the negative of B.\n\nWait, hold on. If the diagonals intersect at the origin, then yes, the origin is the midpoint. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D is (-p, -q). So, the four points of the rhombus are (x, y), (p, q), (-x, -y), (-p, -q).\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, which equals the distance from C to D, and so on. Let me write that out.\n\nDistance AB = Distance BC = Distance CD = Distance DA.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better approach. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, maybe I can parameterize the points on the hyperbola.\n\nLet me consider the diagonals. Let me denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Since they are perpendicular, their slopes must be negative reciprocals of each other. Let me denote the slope of AC as m, then the slope of BD is -1/m.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think in terms of vectors. Let me consider vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. Since the diagonals bisect each other, the coordinates of the midpoints are the origin. So, the midpoint of AC is the origin, which is given. Similarly, the midpoint of BD is the origin.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the vectors AB, BC, CD, and DA all have the same magnitude.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, we can use the properties of the rhombus in terms of the diagonals. In a rhombus, the area is (d1*d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. Also, each side can be expressed in terms of the diagonals: side length = sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 ). So, all sides are equal, which gives us a condition.\n\nBut in this case, all four points lie on the hyperbola, so their coordinates must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, let's denote points A, B, C, D as (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (-x1, -y1), (-x2, -y2), respectively.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, and so on.\n\nLet me compute AB and BC.\n\nAB distance squared: (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2.\n\nBC distance squared: (-x1 - x2)^2 + (-y1 - y2)^2 = (x1 + x2)^2 + (y1 + y2)^2.\n\nSince AB = BC, their squares must be equal:\n\n(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 = (x1 + x2)^2 + (y1 + y2)^2.\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side: (x2\u00b2 - 2x1x2 + x1\u00b2) + (y2\u00b2 - 2y1y2 + y1\u00b2).\n\nRight side: (x1\u00b2 + 2x1x2 + x2\u00b2) + (y1\u00b2 + 2y1y2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nSubtracting left side from right side:\n\n[ (x1\u00b2 + 2x1x2 + x2\u00b2) + (y1\u00b2 + 2y1y2 + y2\u00b2) ] - [ (x2\u00b2 - 2x1x2 + x1\u00b2) + (y2\u00b2 - 2y1y2 + y1\u00b2) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nx1\u00b2 + 2x1x2 + x2\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 + 2y1y2 + y2\u00b2 - x2\u00b2 + 2x1x2 - x1\u00b2 - y2\u00b2 + 2y1y2 - y1\u00b2\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nx1\u00b2 cancels with -x1\u00b2.\n\nx2\u00b2 cancels with -x2\u00b2.\n\ny1\u00b2 cancels with -y1\u00b2.\n\ny2\u00b2 cancels with -y2\u00b2.\n\nWhat's left:\n\n2x1x2 + 2x1x2 + 2y1y2 + 2y1y2.\n\nWhich is 4x1x2 + 4y1y2 = 0.\n\nSo, 4x1x2 + 4y1y2 = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nx1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nSo, that's an important condition: x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nWhich suggests that the vectors OA and OB are perpendicular. Because the dot product of vectors OA and OB is x1x2 + y1y2, which equals zero. So, OA is perpendicular to OB.\n\nSo, that's a key insight. So, points A and B are such that OA is perpendicular to OB, and both points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, let me write that down:\n\nGiven points A (x1, y1) and B (x2, y2) on the hyperbola, such that x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nSo, we have two points on the hyperbola, with OA perpendicular to OB.\n\nWe need to find BD squared, which is the square of the distance between points B and D. But wait, point D is (-x2, -y2), so BD is the distance between (x2, y2) and (-x2, -y2).\n\nSo, BD squared is (x2 - (-x2))\u00b2 + (y2 - (-y2))\u00b2 = (2x2)^2 + (2y2)^2 = 4x2\u00b2 + 4y2\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, AC squared is the distance between A and C, which is (x1 - (-x1))\u00b2 + (y1 - (-y1))\u00b2 = (2x1)^2 + (2y1)^2 = 4(x1\u00b2 + y1\u00b2).\n\nBut in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is -1. Wait, but we already have that OA is perpendicular to OB, so that's the condition we used.\n\nBut perhaps I should focus on BD squared, which is 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2). So, to find the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, I need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nBut BD\u00b2 is dependent on point B, which is on the hyperbola, and also subject to the condition that OA is perpendicular to OB, where A is also on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, perhaps I can parametrize points A and B such that OA is perpendicular to OB, and both lie on the hyperbola.\n\nLet me denote point A as (x, y), then point B must satisfy x*x2 + y*y2 = 0, as we have earlier.\n\nSince both A and B lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 and x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, perhaps I can parametrize point A in terms of hyperbola parameters.\n\nFor hyperbola parametrization, maybe using hyperbolic functions. For a hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a parametrization is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). Alternatively, sometimes (a cosh t, b sinh t) is used, but that's for the right hyperbola.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using rational parametrization.\n\nBut perhaps using angles.\n\nWait, since OA is perpendicular to OB, we can think of points A and B as points on the hyperbola such that their position vectors are perpendicular.\n\nSo, for any point A on the hyperbola, point B must lie on the hyperbola and also lie on the line perpendicular to OA at the origin.\n\nSo, given point A (x, y), the line perpendicular to OA is y = (-x/y) x. So, the line is y = (-x/y) x. Wait, that might not be correct.\n\nWait, the slope of OA is y/x, so the slope of the perpendicular line is -x/y.\n\nSo, point B must lie on both the hyperbola and the line y = (-x/y) x.\n\nWait, that seems a bit recursive. Let me denote the coordinates of B as (x2, y2). Then, the condition is x*x2 + y*y2 = 0.\n\nSo, for a given point A(x, y), point B must lie on the hyperbola and satisfy x*x2 + y*y2 = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express y2 in terms of x2: y2 = (-x*x2)/y.\n\nSubstituting into the hyperbola equation for point B:\n\nx2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nReplace y2 with (-x x2)/y:\n\nx2\u00b2/20 - [ (x\u00b2 x2\u00b2) / y\u00b2 ] /24 = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx2\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2 x2\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) = 1.\n\nFactor out x2\u00b2:\n\nx2\u00b2 [ 1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 = 1 / [ 1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) ].\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as:\n\nx2\u00b2 = 1 / [ (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2) / (24 * 20 y\u00b2) ) ].\n\nWait, let me compute the denominator:\n\n1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) = [ (24 y\u00b2) - 20 x\u00b2 ] / (24 * 20 y\u00b2).\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 = 1 / [ (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2) / (480 y\u00b2) ) ] = 480 y\u00b2 / (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 4:\n\nx2\u00b2 = (120 y\u00b2) / (6 y\u00b2 - 5 x\u00b2).\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 = (120 y\u00b2)/(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2).\n\nNow, since point A is on the hyperbola, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we can express y\u00b2 in terms of x\u00b2:\n\nFrom x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nMultiply both sides by 24*20 = 480:\n\n24 x\u00b2 - 20 y\u00b2 = 480.\n\nRearranged: 24 x\u00b2 - 480 = 20 y\u00b2.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = (24 x\u00b2 - 480)/20 = (6 x\u00b2 - 120)/5.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = (6 x\u00b2 - 120)/5.\n\nPlugging this into the expression for x2\u00b2:\n\nx2\u00b2 = [120 * (6 x\u00b2 - 120)/5 ] / [6*(6 x\u00b2 - 120)/5 -5 x\u00b2 ].\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator.\n\nFirst, numerator:\n\n120*(6x\u00b2 - 120)/5 = (120/5)*(6x\u00b2 - 120) = 24*(6x\u00b2 - 120) = 144x\u00b2 - 2880.\n\nDenominator:\n\n6*(6x\u00b2 - 120)/5 -5x\u00b2 = [ (36x\u00b2 - 720)/5 ] -5x\u00b2 = (36x\u00b2 - 720 -25x\u00b2)/5 = (11x\u00b2 -720)/5.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 = (144x\u00b2 -2880) / [ (11x\u00b2 -720)/5 ] = 5*(144x\u00b2 -2880)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n144x\u00b2 -2880 = 144(x\u00b2 -20).\n\nDenominator: 11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 = 5*144(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720) = 720(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nNow, we can factor numerator and denominator:\n\n11x\u00b2 -720 = 11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nx\u00b2 -20 is (x\u00b2 -20).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write 11x\u00b2 -720 as 11(x\u00b2 - 720/11).\n\nBut maybe not helpful. Let me see if I can simplify this expression.\n\nx2\u00b2 = [720(x\u00b2 -20)] / (11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nx2\u00b2 = 720(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor 720 as 720 = 72*10 = 8*9*10, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the denominator in terms of the numerator.\n\nLet me see:\n\nDenominator: 11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nNumerator: 720x\u00b2 - 720*20 = 720x\u00b2 -14400.\n\nWait, numerator is 720(x\u00b2 -20) =720x\u00b2 -14400.\n\nDenominator is 11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nSo, perhaps I can perform division:\n\nDivide 720x\u00b2 -14400 by 11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nLet me write it as (720x\u00b2 -14400) \u00f7 (11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 720x\u00b2 -14400 =720(x\u00b2 -20).\n\nDenominator: 11x\u00b2 -720 =11(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nSo, perhaps if I write x\u00b2 as t, then x2\u00b2 = 720(t -20)/(11t -720).\n\nLet t = x\u00b2.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 = 720(t -20)/(11t -720).\n\nI can write this as x2\u00b2 = [720(t -20)] / (11t -720).\n\nLet me see if I can write this as a multiple plus a remainder.\n\nLet me perform the division:\n\nDivide 720(t -20) by (11t -720).\n\nExpress as:\n\n720(t -20) = A*(11t -720) + B.\n\nFind A and B such that:\n\n720(t -20) = A*(11t -720) + B.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n720t - 14400 = 11A t -720A + B.\n\nComparing coefficients:\n\n720 = 11A \u21d2 A = 720/11 \u224865.4545.\n\n-14400 = -720A + B.\n\nCompute B:\n\nB = -14400 +720A.\n\nSubstitute A=720/11:\n\nB = -14400 +720*(720/11) = -14400 + (720\u00b2)/11.\n\nCompute 720\u00b2: 720*720 = 518400.\n\nSo, B = -14400 + 518400/11.\n\nCompute 518400 /11: 518400 \u00f7 11 = 47127.2727...\n\nSo, B = -14400 + 47127.2727 \u2248 32727.2727.\n\nBut maybe it's better to keep it in fractions.\n\nSo, A=720/11, B= (720\u00b2)/11 -14400.\n\nCompute B:\n\n720\u00b2 = 518400.\n\nSo, (518400)/11 = 47127 3/11.\n\n14400 = 14400/1.\n\nSo, B = 47127 3/11 -14400 = (47127 -14400) + 3/11 = 32727 +3/11 =32727 3/11.\n\nSo, 720(t -20) = (720/11)(11t -720) + (32727 3/11).\n\nTherefore,\n\nx2\u00b2 = [720(t -20)]/(11t -720) = (720/11) + [32727 3/11]/(11t -720).\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if this helps. Maybe I should instead express x2\u00b2 in terms of t and find its minimum or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express BD\u00b2 in terms of x2\u00b2, since BD\u00b2 =4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nBut from point B lying on the hyperbola, we have x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo, y2\u00b2 = (x2\u00b2/20 -1)*24 = (x2\u00b2 -20)/20 *24 = (x2\u00b2 -20)*(24/20) = (x2\u00b2 -20)*(6/5) = (6x2\u00b2 -120)/5.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2) =4[ x2\u00b2 + (6x2\u00b2 -120)/5 ].\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n= (5x2\u00b2 +6x2\u00b2 -120)/5 = (11x2\u00b2 -120)/5.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4*(11x2\u00b2 -120)/5 = (44x2\u00b2 -480)/5.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (44x2\u00b2 -480)/5.\n\nBut from earlier, x2\u00b2 =720(t -20)/(11t -720), where t =x\u00b2.\n\nWait, but t is related to x2\u00b2? Hmm, no, perhaps I need another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express x2\u00b2 in terms of t, which is x\u00b2.\n\nWait, from earlier, x2\u00b2 = [720(t -20)] / (11t -720).\n\nSo, substitute this into BD\u00b2 expression.\n\nBD\u00b2 = (44x2\u00b2 -480)/5.\n\nSubstitute x2\u00b2:\n\n= [44*(720(t -20)/(11t -720)) -480 ] /5.\n\nFactor out 44 and 480:\n\n= [ (44*720(t -20) -480*(11t -720) ) / (11t -720) ] /5.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n44*720(t -20) -480*(11t -720).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n44*720 = 31680.\n\nSo, 31680(t -20) =31680t -633600.\n\n480*11 =5280, 480*720=345600.\n\nSo, -480*(11t -720) = -5280t +345600.\n\nSo, total numerator:\n\n31680t -633600 -5280t +345600 = (31680t -5280t) + (-633600 +345600) = 26400t -288000.\n\nSo, numerator is 26400t -288000.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2 = [ (26400t -288000)/(11t -720) ] /5.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n26400t -288000 = 2400*(11t -120).\n\nWait, 2400*11t =26400t, 2400*(-120)= -288000. So yes, numerator is 2400*(11t -120).\n\nDenominator is 11t -720.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = [2400*(11t -120) / (11t -720) ] /5.\n\nSimplify:\n\nBD\u00b2 = (2400/5)*(11t -120)/(11t -720) = 480*(11t -120)/(11t -720).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =480*(11t -120)/(11t -720).\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n(11t -120)/(11t -720) = [ (11t -720) +600 ] / (11t -720) =1 + 600/(11t -720).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =480*(1 +600/(11t -720)).\n\nBut 11t -720 =11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nWait, but t is x\u00b2, so 11t -720 =11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nBut since point A is on the hyperbola, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, so x\u00b2 =20(1 + y\u00b2/24).\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, the denominator 11t -720 must not be zero, so 11x\u00b2 \u2260720 \u21d2 x\u00b2 \u2260720/11 \u224865.4545.\n\nBut since the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, the x\u00b2 must be at least 20, because y\u00b2 can't be negative. So, x\u00b2 \u226520.\n\nSo, t =x\u00b2 \u226520.\n\nSo, 11t -720 =11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nWe need 11x\u00b2 -720 \u22600, so x\u00b2 \u2260720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =480*(1 +600/(11t -720)).\n\nBut 11t -720 =11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nSo, let me denote s =11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nSo, s =11t -720.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2 =480*(1 +600/s) =480 + (480*600)/s =480 + 288000/s.\n\nBut s =11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nFrom the hyperbola equation, x\u00b2 =20(1 + y\u00b2/24).\n\nBut perhaps I can express s in terms of t:\n\ns =11t -720.\n\nSo, s can take what values?\n\nGiven t =x\u00b2 \u226520, so s=11t -720 \u226511*20 -720=220-720= -500.\n\nSo, s \u2265-500.\n\nBut s cannot be zero, as we saw.\n\nSo, s \u2208 [-500,0) \u222a (0, \u221e).\n\nBut also, point B lies on the hyperbola, so from the earlier expression for x2\u00b2, x2\u00b2 must be positive.\n\nSo, let's see: x2\u00b2 =720(t -20)/(11t -720).\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 must be positive.\n\nSo, the numerator and denominator must have the same sign.\n\nSo, 720(t -20) and (11t -720) must be both positive or both negative.\n\nCase 1: Both positive.\n\n720(t -20) >0 \u21d2 t >20.\n\n11t -720>0 \u21d2 t>720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, in this case, t>65.4545.\n\nCase2: Both negative.\n\n720(t -20) <0 \u21d2 t<20.\n\nBut t =x\u00b2 \u226520, so t cannot be less than 20. Hence, only Case 1 is possible.\n\nTherefore, t>65.4545.\n\nSo, s=11t -720 >0.\n\nSo, s>0.\n\nSo, s \u2208 (0, \u221e).\n\nThus, BD\u00b2=480 +288000/s.\n\nWe need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is the minimum value that BD\u00b2 can take, but since s can be made arbitrarily large, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nBut wait, s=11t -720, and t=x\u00b2, which can be as large as possible because the hyperbola extends to infinity. So, as t increases, s increases, and 288000/s approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nTherefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the infimum is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Because BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as desired by taking t approaching infinity, but never actually reaching 480.\n\nWait, but BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but never less than 480.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. If s approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480.\n\nWait, no, let's check:\n\nBD\u00b2 =480 +288000/s.\n\nSince s>0, 288000/s is positive, so BD\u00b2>480.\n\nSo, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 480, approached as s\u2192infty, which corresponds to t\u2192infty.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be 480.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, since BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because 480 is the infimum.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but I should verify this with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers to minimize BD\u00b2, subject to the constraints that OA is perpendicular to OB, and both points lie on the hyperbola.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 is 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2), and from hyperbola equation, x2\u00b2 =20(1 + y2\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 =20 + (20 y2\u00b2)/24 =20 + (5 y2\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4[20 + (5 y2\u00b2)/6 + y2\u00b2] =4[20 + (11 y2\u00b2)/6 ]=80 + (44 y2\u00b2)/6=80 + (22 y2\u00b2)/3.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3)y2\u00b2.\n\nTo minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize y2\u00b2.\n\nBut y2\u00b2 is subject to the condition that OA is perpendicular to OB, so x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nBut points A and B are on the hyperbola, so their coordinates satisfy x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24=1 and x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24=1.\n\nBut perhaps this approach complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, since BD\u00b2=4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2), and from hyperbola equation, x2\u00b2=20(1 + y2\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4[20(1 + y2\u00b2/24) + y2\u00b2] =4[20 + (20 y2\u00b2)/24 + y2\u00b2] =4[20 + (5 y2\u00b2)/6 + y2\u00b2] =4[20 + (11 y2\u00b2)/6 ].\n\nWhich is 80 + (44 y2\u00b2)/6=80 + (22 y2\u00b2)/3.\n\nSo, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize y2\u00b2.\n\nBut y2\u00b2 is constrained by the condition that OA is perpendicular to OB, i.e., x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nBut points A and B are on the hyperbola, so we have x1\u00b2=20(1 + y1\u00b2/24), x2\u00b2=20(1 + y2\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, x1=\u00b1\u221a[20(1 + y1\u00b2/24)], similarly for x2.\n\nBut given that OA is perpendicular to OB, x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nLet me consider vectors OA and OB.\n\nLet me denote OA as (x1, y1), OB as (x2, y2).\n\nDot product is zero: x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nSo, OA \u00b7 OB=0.\n\nSo, OA and OB are perpendicular vectors.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parametrize points A and B such that OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nLet me consider point A as (a, b) on the hyperbola, then point B must be such that (a, b)\u00b7(x2, y2)=0 \u21d2 a x2 + b y2=0.\n\nSo, y2= - (a x2)/b.\n\nSubstitute into hyperbola equation for B:\n\nx2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2/20 - [ (a\u00b2 x2\u00b2)/b\u00b2 ] /24=1.\n\nFactor x2\u00b2:\n\nx2\u00b2 [1/20 - (a\u00b2)/(24 b\u00b2) ] =1.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2=1/[1/20 - a\u00b2/(24 b\u00b2) ].\n\nBut since point A is on the hyperbola, a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo, let me solve for a\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2=20(1 + b\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, a\u00b2=20 + (20 b\u00b2)/24=20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, substituting back into x2\u00b2:\n\nx2\u00b2=1/[1/20 - (20 +5 b\u00b2/6)/(24 b\u00b2) ].\n\nCompute the denominator:\n\n1/20 - [ (20 + (5b\u00b2)/6 )/(24 b\u00b2) ].\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\n[20 + (5b\u00b2)/6 ]/(24 b\u00b2)= [ (120 +5b\u00b2)/6 ]/(24 b\u00b2)= (120 +5b\u00b2)/(144 b\u00b2).\n\nSo, denominator is 1/20 - (120 +5b\u00b2)/(144 b\u00b2).\n\nFind common denominator, which is 720 b\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n1/20 =36 b\u00b2/(720 b\u00b2),\n\n(120 +5b\u00b2)/(144 b\u00b2)= [ (120 +5b\u00b2)*5 ]/(720 b\u00b2)= (600 +25b\u00b2)/(720 b\u00b2).\n\nSo, denominator:\n\n[36 b\u00b2 -600 -25b\u00b2]/720 b\u00b2= (11b\u00b2 -600)/(720 b\u00b2).\n\nThus, x2\u00b2=1 / [ (11b\u00b2 -600)/(720 b\u00b2) ] =720 b\u00b2/(11b\u00b2 -600).\n\nSo, x2\u00b2=720 b\u00b2/(11b\u00b2 -600).\n\nBut since x2\u00b2 must be positive, denominator must have same sign as numerator.\n\nNumerator:720 b\u00b2>0.\n\nSo, denominator must be positive:11b\u00b2 -600>0 \u21d2 b\u00b2>600/11\u224854.5455.\n\nSo, b\u00b2>54.5455.\n\nSo, now, BD\u00b2=4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nWe have x2\u00b2=720 b\u00b2/(11b\u00b2 -600).\n\nAnd y2= -

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I'm looking for the infimum of BD\u00b2, the lower bound of BD squared, such that it's the largest number that doesn't exceed BD\u00b2 for any possible rhombus satisfying the conditions.\n\nFirst, let's recall some properties of a rhombus. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Yes, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, and each diagonal bisects the other.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if I denote the diagonals as AC and BD, then points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and points B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the origin is the midpoint, the coordinates of C would be the negative of A, and similarly, D would be the negative of B.\n\nWait, hold on. If the diagonals intersect at the origin, then yes, the origin is the midpoint. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D is (-p, -q). So, the four points of the rhombus are (x, y), (p, q), (-x, -y), (-p, -q).\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, which equals the distance from C to D, and so on. Let me write that out.\n\nDistance AB = Distance BC = Distance CD = Distance DA.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better approach. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, maybe I can parameterize the points on the hyperbola.\n\nLet me consider the diagonals. Let me denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Since they are perpendicular, their slopes must be negative reciprocals of each other. Let me denote the slope of AC as m, then the slope of BD is -1/m.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think in terms of vectors. Let me consider vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. Since the diagonals bisect each other, the coordinates of the midpoints are the origin. So, the midpoint of AC is the origin, which is given. Similarly, the midpoint of BD is the origin.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the vectors AB, BC, CD, and DA all have the same magnitude.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, we can use the properties of the rhombus in terms of the diagonals. In a rhombus, the area is (d1*d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. Also, each side can be expressed in terms of the diagonals: side length = sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 ). So, all sides are equal, which gives us a condition.\n\nBut in this case, all four points lie on the hyperbola, so their coordinates must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, let's denote points A, B, C, D as (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (-x1, -y1), (-x2, -y2), respectively.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, and so on.\n\nLet me compute AB and BC.\n\nAB distance squared: (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2.\n\nBC distance squared: (-x1 - x2)^2 + (-y1 - y2)^2 = (x1 + x2)^2 + (y1 + y2)^2.\n\nSince AB = BC, their squares must be equal:\n\n(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 = (x1 + x2)^2 + (y1 + y2)^2.\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side: (x2\u00b2 - 2x1x2 + x1\u00b2) + (y2\u00b2 - 2y1y2 + y1\u00b2).\n\nRight side: (x1\u00b2 + 2x1x2 + x2\u00b2) + (y1\u00b2 + 2y1y2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nSubtracting left side from right side:\n\n[ (x1\u00b2 + 2x1x2 + x2\u00b2) + (y1\u00b2 + 2y1y2 + y2\u00b2) ] - [ (x2\u00b2 - 2x1x2 + x1\u00b2) + (y2\u00b2 - 2y1y2 + y1\u00b2) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nx1\u00b2 + 2x1x2 + x2\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 + 2y1y2 + y2\u00b2 - x2\u00b2 + 2x1x2 - x1\u00b2 - y2\u00b2 + 2y1y2 - y1\u00b2\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nx1\u00b2 cancels with -x1\u00b2.\n\nx2\u00b2 cancels with -x2\u00b2.\n\ny1\u00b2 cancels with -y1\u00b2.\n\ny2\u00b2 cancels with -y2\u00b2.\n\nWhat's left:\n\n2x1x2 + 2x1x2 + 2y1y2 + 2y1y2.\n\nWhich is 4x1x2 + 4y1y2 = 0.\n\nSo, 4x1x2 + 4y1y2 = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nx1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nSo, that's an important condition: x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nWhich suggests that the vectors OA and OB are perpendicular. Because the dot product of vectors OA and OB is x1x2 + y1y2, which equals zero. So, OA is perpendicular to OB.\n\nSo, that's a key insight. So, points A and B are such that OA is perpendicular to OB, and both points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, let me write that down:\n\nGiven points A (x1, y1) and B (x2, y2) on the hyperbola, such that x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nSo, we have two points on the hyperbola, with OA perpendicular to OB.\n\nWe need to find BD squared, which is the square of the distance between points B and D. But wait, point D is (-x2, -y2), so BD is the distance between (x2, y2) and (-x2, -y2).\n\nSo, BD squared is (x2 - (-x2))\u00b2 + (y2 - (-y2))\u00b2 = (2x2)^2 + (2y2)^2 = 4x2\u00b2 + 4y2\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, AC squared is the distance between A and C, which is (x1 - (-x1))\u00b2 + (y1 - (-y1))\u00b2 = (2x1)^2 + (2y1)^2 = 4(x1\u00b2 + y1\u00b2).\n\nBut in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is -1. Wait, but we already have that OA is perpendicular to OB, so that's the condition we used.\n\nBut perhaps I should focus on BD squared, which is 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2). So, to find the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, I need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nBut BD\u00b2 is dependent on point B, which is on the hyperbola, and also subject to the condition that OA is perpendicular to OB, where A is also on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, perhaps I can parametrize points A and B such that OA is perpendicular to OB, and both lie on the hyperbola.\n\nLet me denote point A as (x, y), then point B must satisfy x*x2 + y*y2 = 0, as we have earlier.\n\nSince both A and B lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 and x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, perhaps I can parametrize point A in terms of hyperbola parameters.\n\nFor hyperbola parametrization, maybe using hyperbolic functions. For a hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a parametrization is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). Alternatively, sometimes (a cosh t, b sinh t) is used, but that's for the right hyperbola.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using rational parametrization.\n\nBut perhaps using angles.\n\nWait, since OA is perpendicular to OB, we can think of points A and B as points on the hyperbola such that their position vectors are perpendicular.\n\nSo, for any point A on the hyperbola, point B must lie on the hyperbola and also lie on the line perpendicular to OA at the origin.\n\nSo, given point A (x, y), the line perpendicular to OA is y = (-x/y) x. So, the line is y = (-x/y) x. Wait, that might not be correct.\n\nWait, the slope of OA is y/x, so the slope of the perpendicular line is -x/y.\n\nSo, point B must lie on both the hyperbola and the line y = (-x/y) x.\n\nWait, that seems a bit recursive. Let me denote the coordinates of B as (x2, y2). Then, the condition is x*x2 + y*y2 = 0.\n\nSo, for a given point A(x, y), point B must lie on the hyperbola and satisfy x*x2 + y*y2 = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express y2 in terms of x2: y2 = (-x*x2)/y.\n\nSubstituting into the hyperbola equation for point B:\n\nx2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nReplace y2 with (-x x2)/y:\n\nx2\u00b2/20 - [ (x\u00b2 x2\u00b2) / y\u00b2 ] /24 = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx2\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2 x2\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) = 1.\n\nFactor out x2\u00b2:\n\nx2\u00b2 [ 1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 = 1 / [ 1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) ].\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as:\n\nx2\u00b2 = 1 / [ (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2) / (24 * 20 y\u00b2) ) ].\n\nWait, let me compute the denominator:\n\n1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) = [ (24 y\u00b2) - 20 x\u00b2 ] / (24 * 20 y\u00b2).\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 = 1 / [ (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2) / (480 y\u00b2) ) ] = 480 y\u00b2 / (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 4:\n\nx2\u00b2 = (120 y\u00b2) / (6 y\u00b2 - 5 x\u00b2).\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 = (120 y\u00b2)/(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2).\n\nNow, since point A is on the hyperbola, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we can express y\u00b2 in terms of x\u00b2:\n\nFrom x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nMultiply both sides by 24*20 = 480:\n\n24 x\u00b2 - 20 y\u00b2 = 480.\n\nRearranged: 24 x\u00b2 - 480 = 20 y\u00b2.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = (24 x\u00b2 - 480)/20 = (6 x\u00b2 - 120)/5.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = (6 x\u00b2 - 120)/5.\n\nPlugging this into the expression for x2\u00b2:\n\nx2\u00b2 = [120 * (6 x\u00b2 - 120)/5 ] / [6*(6 x\u00b2 - 120)/5 -5 x\u00b2 ].\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator.\n\nFirst, numerator:\n\n120*(6x\u00b2 - 120)/5 = (120/5)*(6x\u00b2 - 120) = 24*(6x\u00b2 - 120) = 144x\u00b2 - 2880.\n\nDenominator:\n\n6*(6x\u00b2 - 120)/5 -5x\u00b2 = [ (36x\u00b2 - 720)/5 ] -5x\u00b2 = (36x\u00b2 - 720 -25x\u00b2)/5 = (11x\u00b2 -720)/5.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 = (144x\u00b2 -2880) / [ (11x\u00b2 -720)/5 ] = 5*(144x\u00b2 -2880)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n144x\u00b2 -2880 = 144(x\u00b2 -20).\n\nDenominator: 11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 = 5*144(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720) = 720(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nNow, we can factor numerator and denominator:\n\n11x\u00b2 -720 = 11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nx\u00b2 -20 is (x\u00b2 -20).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write 11x\u00b2 -720 as 11(x\u00b2 - 720/11).\n\nBut maybe not helpful. Let me see if I can simplify this expression.\n\nx2\u00b2 = [720(x\u00b2 -20)] / (11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nx2\u00b2 = 720(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor 720 as 720 = 72*10 = 8*9*10, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the denominator in terms of the numerator.\n\nLet me see:\n\nDenominator: 11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nNumerator: 720x\u00b2 - 720*20 = 720x\u00b2 -14400.\n\nWait, numerator is 720(x\u00b2 -20) =720x\u00b2 -14400.\n\nDenominator is 11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nSo, perhaps I can perform division:\n\nDivide 720x\u00b2 -14400 by 11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nLet me write it as (720x\u00b2 -14400) \u00f7 (11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 720x\u00b2 -14400 =720(x\u00b2 -20).\n\nDenominator: 11x\u00b2 -720 =11(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nSo, perhaps if I write x\u00b2 as t, then x2\u00b2 = 720(t -20)/(11t -720).\n\nLet t = x\u00b2.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 = 720(t -20)/(11t -720).\n\nI can write this as x2\u00b2 = [720(t -20)] / (11t -720).\n\nLet me see if I can write this as a multiple plus a remainder.\n\nLet me perform the division:\n\nDivide 720(t -20) by (11t -720).\n\nExpress as:\n\n720(t -20) = A*(11t -720) + B.\n\nFind A and B such that:\n\n720(t -20) = A*(11t -720) + B.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n720t - 14400 = 11A t -720A + B.\n\nComparing coefficients:\n\n720 = 11A \u21d2 A = 720/11 \u224865.4545.\n\n-14400 = -720A + B.\n\nCompute B:\n\nB = -14400 +720A.\n\nSubstitute A=720/11:\n\nB = -14400 +720*(720/11) = -14400 + (720\u00b2)/11.\n\nCompute 720\u00b2: 720*720 = 518400.\n\nSo, B = -14400 + 518400/11.\n\nCompute 518400 /11: 518400 \u00f7 11 = 47127.2727...\n\nSo, B = -14400 + 47127.2727 \u2248 32727.2727.\n\nBut maybe it's better to keep it in fractions.\n\nSo, A=720/11, B= (720\u00b2)/11 -14400.\n\nCompute B:\n\n720\u00b2 = 518400.\n\nSo, (518400)/11 = 47127 3/11.\n\n14400 = 14400/1.\n\nSo, B = 47127 3/11 -14400 = (47127 -14400) + 3/11 = 32727 +3/11 =32727 3/11.\n\nSo, 720(t -20) = (720/11)(11t -720) + (32727 3/11).\n\nTherefore,\n\nx2\u00b2 = [720(t -20)]/(11t -720) = (720/11) + [32727 3/11]/(11t -720).\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if this helps. Maybe I should instead express x2\u00b2 in terms of t and find its minimum or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express BD\u00b2 in terms of x2\u00b2, since BD\u00b2 =4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nBut from point B lying on the hyperbola, we have x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo, y2\u00b2 = (x2\u00b2/20 -1)*24 = (x2\u00b2 -20)/20 *24 = (x2\u00b2 -20)*(24/20) = (x2\u00b2 -20)*(6/5) = (6x2\u00b2 -120)/5.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2) =4[ x2\u00b2 + (6x2\u00b2 -120)/5 ].\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n= (5x2\u00b2 +6x2\u00b2 -120)/5 = (11x2\u00b2 -120)/5.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4*(11x2\u00b2 -120)/5 = (44x2\u00b2 -480)/5.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (44x2\u00b2 -480)/5.\n\nBut from earlier, x2\u00b2 =720(t -20)/(11t -720), where t =x\u00b2.\n\nWait, but t is related to x2\u00b2? Hmm, no, perhaps I need another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express x2\u00b2 in terms of t, which is x\u00b2.\n\nWait, from earlier, x2\u00b2 = [720(t -20)] / (11t -720).\n\nSo, substitute this into BD\u00b2 expression.\n\nBD\u00b2 = (44x2\u00b2 -480)/5.\n\nSubstitute x2\u00b2:\n\n= [44*(720(t -20)/(11t -720)) -480 ] /5.\n\nFactor out 44 and 480:\n\n= [ (44*720(t -20) -480*(11t -720) ) / (11t -720) ] /5.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n44*720(t -20) -480*(11t -720).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n44*720 = 31680.\n\nSo, 31680(t -20) =31680t -633600.\n\n480*11 =5280, 480*720=345600.\n\nSo, -480*(11t -720) = -5280t +345600.\n\nSo, total numerator:\n\n31680t -633600 -5280t +345600 = (31680t -5280t) + (-633600 +345600) = 26400t -288000.\n\nSo, numerator is 26400t -288000.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2 = [ (26400t -288000)/(11t -720) ] /5.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n26400t -288000 = 2400*(11t -120).\n\nWait, 2400*11t =26400t, 2400*(-120)= -288000. So yes, numerator is 2400*(11t -120).\n\nDenominator is 11t -720.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = [2400*(11t -120) / (11t -720) ] /5.\n\nSimplify:\n\nBD\u00b2 = (2400/5)*(11t -120)/(11t -720) = 480*(11t -120)/(11t -720).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =480*(11t -120)/(11t -720).\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n(11t -120)/(11t -720) = [ (11t -720) +600 ] / (11t -720) =1 + 600/(11t -720).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =480*(1 +600/(11t -720)).\n\nBut 11t -720 =11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nWait, but t is x\u00b2, so 11t -720 =11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nBut since point A is on the hyperbola, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, so x\u00b2 =20(1 + y\u00b2/24).\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, the denominator 11t -720 must not be zero, so 11x\u00b2 \u2260720 \u21d2 x\u00b2 \u2260720/11 \u224865.4545.\n\nBut since the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, the x\u00b2 must be at least 20, because y\u00b2 can't be negative. So, x\u00b2 \u226520.\n\nSo, t =x\u00b2 \u226520.\n\nSo, 11t -720 =11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nWe need 11x\u00b2 -720 \u22600, so x\u00b2 \u2260720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =480*(1 +600/(11t -720)).\n\nBut 11t -720 =11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nSo, let me denote s =11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nSo, s =11t -720.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2 =480*(1 +600/s) =480 + (480*600)/s =480 + 288000/s.\n\nBut s =11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nFrom the hyperbola equation, x\u00b2 =20(1 + y\u00b2/24).\n\nBut perhaps I can express s in terms of t:\n\ns =11t -720.\n\nSo, s can take what values?\n\nGiven t =x\u00b2 \u226520, so s=11t -720 \u226511*20 -720=220-720= -500.\n\nSo, s \u2265-500.\n\nBut s cannot be zero, as we saw.\n\nSo, s \u2208 [-500,0) \u222a (0, \u221e).\n\nBut also, point B lies on the hyperbola, so from the earlier expression for x2\u00b2, x2\u00b2 must be positive.\n\nSo, let's see: x2\u00b2 =720(t -20)/(11t -720).\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 must be positive.\n\nSo, the numerator and denominator must have the same sign.\n\nSo, 720(t -20) and (11t -720) must be both positive or both negative.\n\nCase 1: Both positive.\n\n720(t -20) >0 \u21d2 t >20.\n\n11t -720>0 \u21d2 t>720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, in this case, t>65.4545.\n\nCase2: Both negative.\n\n720(t -20) <0 \u21d2 t<20.\n\nBut t =x\u00b2 \u226520, so t cannot be less than 20. Hence, only Case 1 is possible.\n\nTherefore, t>65.4545.\n\nSo, s=11t -720 >0.\n\nSo, s>0.\n\nSo, s \u2208 (0, \u221e).\n\nThus, BD\u00b2=480 +288000/s.\n\nWe need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is the minimum value that BD\u00b2 can take, but since s can be made arbitrarily large, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nBut wait, s=11t -720, and t=x\u00b2, which can be as large as possible because the hyperbola extends to infinity. So, as t increases, s increases, and 288000/s approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nTherefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the infimum is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Because BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as desired by taking t approaching infinity, but never actually reaching 480.\n\nWait, but BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but never less than 480.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. If s approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480.\n\nWait, no, let's check:\n\nBD\u00b2 =480 +288000/s.\n\nSince s>0, 288000/s is positive, so BD\u00b2>480.\n\nSo, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 480, approached as s\u2192infty, which corresponds to t\u2192infty.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be 480.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, since BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because 480 is the infimum.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but I should verify this with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers to minimize BD\u00b2, subject to the constraints that OA is perpendicular to OB, and both points lie on the hyperbola.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 is 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2), and from hyperbola equation, x2\u00b2 =20(1 + y2\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 =20 + (20 y2\u00b2)/24 =20 + (5 y2\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4[20 + (5 y2\u00b2)/6 + y2\u00b2] =4[20 + (11 y2\u00b2)/6 ]=80 + (44 y2\u00b2)/6=80 + (22 y2\u00b2)/3.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3)y2\u00b2.\n\nTo minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize y2\u00b2.\n\nBut y2\u00b2 is subject to the condition that OA is perpendicular to OB, so x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nBut points A and B are on the hyperbola, so their coordinates satisfy x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24=1 and x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24=1.\n\nBut perhaps this approach complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, since BD\u00b2=4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2), and from hyperbola equation, x2\u00b2=20(1 + y2\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4[20(1 + y2\u00b2/24) + y2\u00b2] =4[20 + (20 y2\u00b2)/24 + y2\u00b2] =4[20 + (5 y2\u00b2)/6 + y2\u00b2] =4[20 + (11 y2\u00b2)/6 ].\n\nWhich is 80 + (44 y2\u00b2)/6=80 + (22 y2\u00b2)/3.\n\nSo, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize y2\u00b2.\n\nBut y2\u00b2 is constrained by the condition that OA is perpendicular to OB, i.e., x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nBut points A and B are on the hyperbola, so we have x1\u00b2=20(1 + y1\u00b2/24), x2\u00b2=20(1 + y2\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, x1=\u00b1\u221a[20(1 + y1\u00b2/24)], similarly for x2.\n\nBut given that OA is perpendicular to OB, x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nLet me consider vectors OA and OB.\n\nLet me denote OA as (x1, y1), OB as (x2, y2).\n\nDot product is zero: x1x2 + y1y2=0.\n\nSo, OA \u00b7 OB=0.\n\nSo, OA and OB are perpendicular vectors.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parametrize points A and B such that OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nLet me consider point A as (a, b) on the hyperbola, then point B must be such that (a, b)\u00b7(x2, y2)=0 \u21d2 a x2 + b y2=0.\n\nSo, y2= - (a x2)/b.\n\nSubstitute into hyperbola equation for B:\n\nx2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2/20 - [ (a\u00b2 x2\u00b2)/b\u00b2 ] /24=1.\n\nFactor x2\u00b2:\n\nx2\u00b2 [1/20 - (a\u00b2)/(24 b\u00b2) ] =1.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2=1/[1/20 - a\u00b2/(24 b\u00b2) ].\n\nBut since point A is on the hyperbola, a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo, let me solve for a\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2=20(1 + b\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, a\u00b2=20 + (20 b\u00b2)/24=20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, substituting back into x2\u00b2:\n\nx2\u00b2=1/[1/20 - (20 +5 b\u00b2/6)/(24 b\u00b2) ].\n\nCompute the denominator:\n\n1/20 - [ (20 + (5b\u00b2)/6 )/(24 b\u00b2) ].\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\n[20 + (5b\u00b2)/6 ]/(24 b\u00b2)= [ (120 +5b\u00b2)/6 ]/(24 b\u00b2)= (120 +5b\u00b2)/(144 b\u00b2).\n\nSo, denominator is 1/20 - (120 +5b\u00b2)/(144 b\u00b2).\n\nFind common denominator, which is 720 b\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n1/20 =36 b\u00b2/(720 b\u00b2),\n\n(120 +5b\u00b2)/(144 b\u00b2)= [ (120 +5b\u00b2)*5 ]/(720 b\u00b2)= (600 +25b\u00b2)/(720 b\u00b2).\n\nSo, denominator:\n\n[36 b\u00b2 -600 -25b\u00b2]/720 b\u00b2= (11b\u00b2 -600)/(720 b\u00b2).\n\nThus, x2\u00b2=1 / [ (11b\u00b2 -600)/(720 b\u00b2) ] =720 b\u00b2/(11b\u00b2 -600).\n\nSo, x2\u00b2=720 b\u00b2/(11b\u00b2 -600).\n\nBut since x2\u00b2 must be positive, denominator must have same sign as numerator.\n\nNumerator:720 b\u00b2>0.\n\nSo, denominator must be positive:11b\u00b2 -600>0 \u21d2 b\u00b2>600/11\u224854.5455.\n\nSo, b\u00b2>54.5455.\n\nSo, now, BD\u00b2=4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nWe have x2\u00b2=720 b\u00b2/(11b\u00b2 -600).\n\nAnd y2= -

\\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\), where the diagonals intersect at the origin. \n\nKey steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Rhombus Properties**: Since \\( ABCD \\) is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, points \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) are diametrically opposite, as are \\( B \\) and \\( D \\). The diagonals are perpendicular, and all sides are equal.\n\n2. **Hyperbola Constraints**: Points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) lie on the hyperbola, satisfying \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\). Additionally, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the dot product of vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{OA} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{OB} \\) is zero, i.e., \\( x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Expressing \\( BD^2 \\)**: The length \\( BD \\) is twice the distance from \\( B \\) to the origin. Thus, \\( BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2) \\).\n\n4. **Minimizing \\( BD^2 \\)**: By analyzing the constraints and using parametrization, it was found that \\( BD^2 \\) can be expressed as \\( 480 \\left( 1 + \\frac{720}{11b^2 - 600} \\right) \\), where \\( b^2 \\) is related to the coordinates of point \\( B \\). As \\( b^2 \\) approaches infinity, \\( BD^2 \\) approaches 480.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The infimum of \\( BD^2 \\) is 480, meaning the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombuses is 480.\n\n\\boxed{480}",

      "reasoning_text": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand what's being asked.\n\nThe hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The rhombus ABCD has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. That means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all its sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, they are. Hmm, no, actually, wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, I remember that now. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n\nSo, given that, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, and they are perpendicular. Also, all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nThe question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, we're looking for the infimum of BD\u00b2, the lower bound of BD squared, such that this number is the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all possible such rhombi. So, it's like the minimum possible BD\u00b2, but they want the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the minimum BD\u00b2, because if BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to some value, that value would be the infimum.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's denote the points on the hyperbola. Since the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes, and the rhombus is centered at the origin, the points A, B, C, D should be arranged symmetrically. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C, being the opposite vertex, should be (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D should be placed symmetrically as well, perhaps as (u, v) and (-u, -v), but maybe in different quadrants.\n\nWait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so if one diagonal is AC, the other diagonal BD should be perpendicular to AC. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, each diagonal is a line passing through the origin.\n\nSo, let's parametrize the points. Let's say diagonal AC lies along a line with slope m, and diagonal BD lies along a line with slope -1/m, since they are perpendicular.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think in terms of vectors. Let me consider points A and C as being along one line through the origin, and B and D along another line perpendicular to that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote point A as (a, b), so point C would be (-a, -b) because it's symmetric about the origin. Similarly, points B and D can be denoted as (c, d) and (-c, -d).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, the rhombus can be defined by two perpendicular vectors originating from the origin.\n\nLet me think: if AC is one diagonal, and BD is the other, then AC and BD are vectors. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. So, vector AC is (a, b) - (-a, -b) = (2a, 2b). Wait, no, actually, the vector AC would be from A to C, but since A is (a, b) and C is (-a, -b), the vector AC is (-2a, -2b). Similarly, the vector BD is (-2c, -2d) if B is (c, d) and D is (-c, -d).\n\nBut since the diagonals are perpendicular, their vectors should be perpendicular. So, the dot product of AC and BD should be zero.\n\nWait, but actually, the diagonals themselves are the vectors AC and BD. So, if AC is the vector from A to C, which is (-2a, -2b), and BD is the vector from B to D, which is (-2c, -2d). But wait, actually, diagonals are the line segments connecting opposite vertices, so vectors AC and BD would be ( -2a, -2b ) and ( -2c, -2d ), respectively. Since they are perpendicular, their dot product must be zero.\n\nSo,\n\n(-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n4ac + 4bd = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nac + bd = 0\n\nSo, that's one equation.\n\nNow, since points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, we have:\n\nFor point A: (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 = 1\n\nFor point B: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 = 1\n\nSimilarly, since C and D are just reflections, their equations are the same as A and B.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C, and so on.\n\nWait, but maybe another approach is better. In a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy the relation:\n\n4*(side length)^2 = (AC)^2 + (BD)^2\n\nBut since all sides are equal, let's denote the side length as s.\n\nSo, 4s\u00b2 = (AC)^2 + (BD)^2\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the area is (AC * BD)/2, and each side can be found using the Pythagorean theorem based on the halves of the diagonals.\n\nYes, so each side is sqrt[(AC/2)^2 + (BD/2)^2], so squared, each side squared is (AC\u00b2 + BD\u00b2)/4. So, 4*(side squared) = AC\u00b2 + BD\u00b2. So, that's correct.\n\nBut since all sides are equal, that equation holds.\n\nBut perhaps instead of focusing on the sides, I can find relations between a, b, c, d.\n\nWe have the condition from the diagonals being perpendicular: ac + bd = 0.\n\nAlso, points A and B lie on the hyperbola, so:\n\na\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nc\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nWe also know that the sides are equal, so the distance from A to B equals the distance from B to C.\n\nWait, let's compute distance AB squared.\n\nAB squared is (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2.\n\nSimilarly, BC squared is (c - (-a))^2 + (d - (-b))^2 = (c + a)^2 + (d + b)^2.\n\nSince AB = BC, their squares are equal:\n\n(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: a\u00b2 - 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2bd + d\u00b2\n\nRight side: a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2\n\nSubtract left side from right side:\n\n( a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2 ) - ( a\u00b2 - 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2bd + d\u00b2 ) = 4ac + 4bd = 0\n\nSo, 4ac + 4bd = 0 \u2192 ac + bd = 0\n\nWhich is the same condition as before. So, that doesn't give us any new information.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need another condition. Since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides are equal, but maybe the vectors AB and AD should have the same magnitude.\n\nWait, point A is (a, b), point B is (c, d), point D is (-c, -d).\n\nSo, vector AB is (c - a, d - b), vector AD is (-c - a, -d - b)\n\nThe magnitudes should be equal:\n\nsqrt( (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 ) = sqrt( (-c - a)^2 + (-d - b)^2 )\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 = ( -c - a )^2 + ( -d - b )^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft: c\u00b2 - 2ac + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - 2bd + b\u00b2\n\nRight: c\u00b2 + 2ac + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + 2bd + b\u00b2\n\nSetting equal:\n\nc\u00b2 - 2ac + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - 2bd + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2 + 2ac + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + 2bd + b\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2ac - 2bd = 2ac + 2bd\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n-4ac -4bd = 0 \u2192 ac + bd = 0\n\nAgain, same condition. So, perhaps this isn't giving us new information either.\n\nSo, perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nLet me consider parametrizing points A and B. Since the hyperbola is symmetric, maybe I can use parametric equations for the hyperbola.\n\nThe standard parametrization for hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1 is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). So, for our case, a\u00b2=20, so a=2\u221a5, and b\u00b2=24, so b=2\u221a6.\n\nSo, points on the hyperbola can be written as (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). Let me denote point A as (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). Then, point C is (-2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan\u03b8).\n\nNow, since the diagonals are AC and BD, and they are perpendicular, the other diagonal BD must be perpendicular to AC.\n\nThe slope of AC can be calculated from points A and C. Wait, but AC is a line from A to C, which is from (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) to (-2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). So, the slope of AC is [ (-2\u221a6 tan\u03b8 - 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) ] / [ (-2\u221a5 sec\u03b8 - 2\u221a5 sec\u03b8) ] = [ -4\u221a6 tan\u03b8 ] / [ -4\u221a5 sec\u03b8 ] = (\u221a6/\u221a5) tan\u03b8 sec\u03b8^{-1} ?\n\nWait, let's compute it properly.\n\nSlope m_AC = (y_C - y_A)/(x_C - x_A) = ( -2\u221a6 tan\u03b8 - 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8 ) / ( -2\u221a5 sec\u03b8 - 2\u221a5 sec\u03b8 ) = ( -4\u221a6 tan\u03b8 ) / ( -4\u221a5 sec\u03b8 ) = (\u221a6 tan\u03b8)/(\u221a5 sec\u03b8 )\n\nSimplify: tan\u03b8 / sec\u03b8 = sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, m_AC = (\u221a6 / \u221a5) sin\u03b8.\n\nSince BD is perpendicular to AC, its slope m_BD is the negative reciprocal of m_AC.\n\nSo, m_BD = - (\u221a5 / \u221a6 ) / sin\u03b8.\n\nBut BD is a diagonal passing through the origin, so the line BD has the equation y = m_BD x.\n\nSo, points B and D lie on this line and on the hyperbola.\n\nLet me denote point B as (x, y) lying on both the hyperbola and the line y = m_BD x.\n\nSo, substituting into the hyperbola equation:\n\nx\u00b2 / 20 - (m_BD x)^2 / 24 = 1\n\nWhich is:\n\nx\u00b2 / 20 - ( (5/6) / sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) x\u00b2 / 24 = 1\n\nWait, hold on. Let me compute m_BD correctly.\n\nEarlier, m_AC was (\u221a6 / \u221a5) sin\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, m_BD = - (\u221a5 / \u221a6 ) / sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, m_BD = - (\u221a5)/(\u221a6 sin\u03b8 )\n\nSo, m_BD squared is (5)/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nSo, substituting into the hyperbola equation for point B:\n\nx\u00b2 / 20 - ( (5)/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) x\u00b2 ) /24 = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (5)/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 * 24) ] = 1\n\nCompute the coefficient:\n\n1/20 - (5)/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\n= (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 5 * 20 ) / (20 * 144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nWait, maybe a better approach.\n\nCompute:\n\n1/20 - (5)/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 *24 ) = 1/20 - 5/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nSo, x\u00b2 [ 1/20 - 5/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] = 1\n\nThen, x\u00b2 = 1 / [ 1/20 - 5/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ]\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\nFind a common denominator for 1/20 and 5/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nWhich is 20 * 144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nSo,\n\n1/20 = (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) / (2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\n5/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) = (5 * 20 ) / (2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) = 100 / (2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nSo, denominator becomes:\n\n(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 ) / 2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 = 1 / [ (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 ) / 2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] = 2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 )\n\nSimilarly, x is non-zero, so we can write:\n\nx\u00b2 = [2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ] / [144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 ]\n\nSimilarly, since point B is on the hyperbola, this must be positive, so denominator must be positive:\n\n144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 > 0 \u2192 sin\u00b2\u03b8 > 100/144 \u2192 sin\u03b8 > 10/12 or sin\u03b8 < -10/12.\n\nBut sin\u03b8 cannot exceed 1, so 10/12 is 5/6 \u2248 0.8333. So, sin\u03b8 must be \u2265 5/6 or \u2264 -5/6.\n\nSo, \u03b8 must be in the range where sin\u03b8 is \u2265 5/6 or \u2264 -5/6.\n\nSo, that's an important condition.\n\nSo, moving on, x\u00b2 is 2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 )\n\nSimilarly, since y = m_BD x, then y\u00b2 = m_BD\u00b2 x\u00b2.\n\nWhich is:\n\ny\u00b2 = [5/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] * x\u00b2\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = [5/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] * [2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 ) ] \n\nSimplify:\n\nThe sin\u00b2\u03b8 cancels out:\n\ny\u00b2 = (5 * 2880 ) / (6 (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 ) )\n\n= (5 * 480 ) / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 )\n\n= 2400 / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 )\n\nSo, point B is (x, y) = ( sqrt(2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 )) , sqrt(2400 / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 )) )\n\nBut since the hyperbola is symmetric, we can consider \u03b8 in a certain range, say 0 < \u03b8 < \u03c0/2, but considering sin\u03b8 \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, \u03b8 is between arcsin(5/6) and \u03c0/2.\n\nNow, the length BD is the distance between points B and D. Since D is (-x, -y), BD is the distance from (x, y) to (-x, -y), which is sqrt( (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 ) = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 ))^2 = 4(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nSo, let's compute BD\u00b2.\n\nFrom above, x\u00b2 = 2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 )\n\nAnd y\u00b2 = 2400 / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 )\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = [2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 2400 ] / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 )\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 2400 = 2400 + 2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 240(10 + 12 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nDenominator: 144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 = 4(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25 )\n\nWait, 144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = (12 sin\u03b8 )\u00b2, 100 =10\u00b2. Hmm, perhaps factor differently.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to write as:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = [2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 2400 ] / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 )\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 2400 + 2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 240(10 + 12 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nDenominator: 144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 = 4(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 )\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = [240(10 + 12 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] / [4(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 ) ] = [60(10 + 12 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] / [36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 ]\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 ) = 4 * [60(10 + 12 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] / [36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 ] \n\nSimplify:\n\n4 * 60 = 240, so:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 240(10 + 12 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 )\n\nLet me denote sin\u00b2\u03b8 as s for simplicity.\n\nSo, s \u2265 (5/6)^2 = 25/36 \u2248 0.6944.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 240(10 + 12 s ) / (36 s -25 )\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 240 * [10 +12s ] / [36s -25 ]\n\nWe can factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 10 +12s = 2*(5 +6s )\n\nDenominator: 36s -25 = 9*(4s) -25. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 240*(10 +12s)/(36s -25 )\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 10 +12s = 2*(5 +6s )\n\nDenominator: 36s -25 = 36s -25.\n\nNot sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let me write 10 +12s = A*(36s -25 ) + B.\n\nWait, perhaps perform polynomial division or express as a linear function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps write BD\u00b2 as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 240*(10 +12s)/(36s -25 )\n\nLet me see if I can manipulate this expression.\n\nLet me write 10 +12s as (12s +10 ) = (12s - (25/3) + (10 +25/3 )) ?\n\nWait, maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me factor 12 from numerator:\n\n12s +10 = 12(s + 10/12 ) = 12(s + 5/6 )\n\nDenominator: 36s -25 = 9*(4s) -25.\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps make substitution t = s.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 240*(12t +10)/(36t -25 )\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 240*(12t +10)/(36t -25 )\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 12t +10 = 2*(6t +5 )\n\nDenominator: 36t -25 = 9*(4t) -25.\n\nHmm, not much better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 240*(12t +10)/(36t -25 ) = 240*( (12t +10) / (36t -25) )\n\nLet me factor 12 from numerator:\n\n= 240*(12(t + 10/12 )) / (36t -25 )\n\n= 240*(12(t + 5/6 )) / (36t -25 )\n\n= 240*12*(t +5/6 ) / (36t -25 )\n\n= 2880*(t +5/6 ) / (36t -25 )\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express as:\n\nLet me write 36t -25 = 36(t - 25/36 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 240*(12t +10 ) / [36(t -25/36 ) ]\n\n= 240*(12t +10 ) / [36t -25 ]\n\n= 240*(12t +10 ) / [36(t -25/36 ) ]\n\n= (240/36)*(12t +10 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\n= (20/3)*(12t +10 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nHmm, maybe.\n\nWait, 12t +10 = 12(t + 10/12 ) = 12(t + 5/6 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = (20/3)*(12(t +5/6 )) / (t -25/36 )\n\n= (20/3)*(12(t +5/6 )) / (t -25/36 )\n\nSimplify 12 and 20/3:\n\n12 * (20/3) = 80.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, actually:\n\n(20/3) * 12 = 80.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 80*(t +5/6 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80*(t +5/6 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nHmm, that's better.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80*(t +5/6 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nWhere t = s = sin\u00b2\u03b8, and t \u2265 25/36.\n\nSo, t \u2265 25/36 \u2248 0.6944.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 80*(t +5/6 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nLet me compute the expression (t +5/6 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nFirst, let me convert 5/6 and 25/36 to have a common denominator.\n\n5/6 = 30/36\n\n25/36 is as it is.\n\nSo,\n\n(t +30/36 ) / (t -25/36 ) = (t +30/36 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\n= [ (t -25/36 ) + 55/36 ] / (t -25/36 )\n\n= 1 + (55/36 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nSo,\n\n(t +30/36 ) / (t -25/36 ) = 1 + (55/36 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 = 80 * [ 1 + (55/36 ) / (t -25/36 ) ]\n\n= 80 + 80*(55/36 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nSimplify 80*(55/36 ):\n\n80 = 16*5, 55=11*5, 36=12*3.\n\nSo,\n\n80*(55/36 ) = (16*5)*(11*5)/(12*3 ) = (16*11*25 )/(12*3 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n16/12 = 4/3,\n\nSo,\n\n(4/3)*(11*25)/(3 ) = (4*11*25 )/(9 )\n\n4*11=44, 44*25=1100,\n\nSo, 1100 /9 \u2248 122.222...\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + (1100/9 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\n= 80 + (1100/9 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + (1100/9 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nNow, since t \u226525/36, the denominator (t -25/36 ) is non-negative.\n\nTo minimize BD\u00b2, we need to maximize the second term, which would require minimizing (t -25/36 ). Because as t approaches 25/36 from above, (t -25/36 ) approaches zero, making the second term very large, thus BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem says to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily large, but perhaps there's a lower bound?\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, when t increases, (t -25/36 ) increases, so the second term (1100/9 ) / (t -25/36 ) decreases. So, BD\u00b2 approaches 80 as t approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but t = sin\u00b2\u03b8, which is at most 1. So, t can go up to 1.\n\nSo, when t approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches:\n\n80 + (1100/9 ) / (1 -25/36 ) = 80 + (1100/9 ) / (11/36 )\n\nCompute 11/36 is denominator.\n\nSo, (1100/9 ) / (11/36 ) = (1100/9 ) * (36/11 ) = (1100 * 36 ) / (9 *11 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n1100 /11 = 100,\n\n36 /9 =4,\n\nSo, 100 *4=400.\n\nThus, when t approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches 80 +400=480.\n\nWait, but when t approaches 25/36 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity. So, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large by choosing t close to 25/36.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that is, the infimum of BD\u00b2, because BD\u00b2 can be made as large as desired, but perhaps there's a minimum value.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when t increases, BD\u00b2 decreases towards 80. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 80, but when t approaches infinity, but t is limited to t \u22641. So, as t approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nWait, no, hold on.\n\nWait, earlier computation:\n\nWhen t approaches 1,\n\nBD\u00b2 approaches 80 +400=480.\n\nWhen t approaches 25/36 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be made as large as desired, but the minimal BD\u00b2 is 80, achieved when t approaches infinity, but t is limited to 1. Wait, no, t cannot exceed 1 because sin\u00b2\u03b8 cannot exceed 1.\n\nWait, when t approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut when t approaches 25/36 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWait, so BD\u00b2 can be as small as 80, but wait, when t approaches infinity, but t is bounded by 1. So, as t increases from 25/36 to 1, BD\u00b2 decreases from infinity to 480.\n\nWait, so the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, but wait, when t approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, but as t approaches 25/36 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because when t is larger, BD\u00b2 is smaller.\n\nWait, let me recast BD\u00b2.\n\nWe have BD\u00b2 = 80 + (1100/9 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nAs t increases, the term (t -25/36 ) increases, so the second term decreases, so BD\u00b2 approaches 80 from above.\n\nWait, but t is at maximum 1, so when t =1, BD\u00b2 =80 + (1100/9 )/(1 -25/36 ) =80 + (1100/9)/(11/36 )=80 + (1100/9)*(36/11 )=80 + (100*4)= 80 +400=480.\n\nSo, when t=1, BD\u00b2=480.\n\nBut wait, if t approaches infinity, but t is limited to 1, so as t increases from 25/36 to 1, BD\u00b2 decreases from infinity to 480.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, and it can be made arbitrarily large.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, but can be made larger, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, but can be larger. Wait, but that's not correct because BD\u00b2 can be larger, but the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\".\n\nWait, so we need the supremum of the lower bounds. The infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480. Because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, so 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When t approaches 25/36 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity. So, BD\u00b2 can be made as large as desired. But when t approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 480, achieved when t=1.\n\nTherefore, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 \u2265480.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". So, if BD\u00b2 can be 480 and more, then 480 is the infimum, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480. So, 480 is the minimal possible BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but in our earlier computation, when t=1, BD\u00b2=480.\n\nSo, yes, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, so 480 is the infimum.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nWait, when t approaches 25/36 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity. So, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large. So, the supremum of BD\u00b2 is infinity, but the infimum is 480.\n\nSo, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 is always at least 480.\n\nHence, the answer is 480.\n",

      "full_content": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand what's being asked.\n\nThe hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The rhombus ABCD has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. That means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all its sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, they are. Hmm, no, actually, wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, I remember that now. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n\nSo, given that, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, and they are perpendicular. Also, all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nThe question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, we're looking for the infimum of BD\u00b2, the lower bound of BD squared, such that this number is the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all possible such rhombi. So, it's like the minimum possible BD\u00b2, but they want the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the minimum BD\u00b2, because if BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to some value, that value would be the infimum.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's denote the points on the hyperbola. Since the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes, and the rhombus is centered at the origin, the points A, B, C, D should be arranged symmetrically. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C, being the opposite vertex, should be (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D should be placed symmetrically as well, perhaps as (u, v) and (-u, -v), but maybe in different quadrants.\n\nWait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so if one diagonal is AC, the other diagonal BD should be perpendicular to AC. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, each diagonal is a line passing through the origin.\n\nSo, let's parametrize the points. Let's say diagonal AC lies along a line with slope m, and diagonal BD lies along a line with slope -1/m, since they are perpendicular.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think in terms of vectors. Let me consider points A and C as being along one line through the origin, and B and D along another line perpendicular to that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote point A as (a, b), so point C would be (-a, -b) because it's symmetric about the origin. Similarly, points B and D can be denoted as (c, d) and (-c, -d).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, the rhombus can be defined by two perpendicular vectors originating from the origin.\n\nLet me think: if AC is one diagonal, and BD is the other, then AC and BD are vectors. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. So, vector AC is (a, b) - (-a, -b) = (2a, 2b). Wait, no, actually, the vector AC would be from A to C, but since A is (a, b) and C is (-a, -b), the vector AC is (-2a, -2b). Similarly, the vector BD is (-2c, -2d) if B is (c, d) and D is (-c, -d).\n\nBut since the diagonals are perpendicular, their vectors should be perpendicular. So, the dot product of AC and BD should be zero.\n\nWait, but actually, the diagonals themselves are the vectors AC and BD. So, if AC is the vector from A to C, which is (-2a, -2b), and BD is the vector from B to D, which is (-2c, -2d). But wait, actually, diagonals are the line segments connecting opposite vertices, so vectors AC and BD would be ( -2a, -2b ) and ( -2c, -2d ), respectively. Since they are perpendicular, their dot product must be zero.\n\nSo,\n\n(-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n4ac + 4bd = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nac + bd = 0\n\nSo, that's one equation.\n\nNow, since points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, we have:\n\nFor point A: (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 = 1\n\nFor point B: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 = 1\n\nSimilarly, since C and D are just reflections, their equations are the same as A and B.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C, and so on.\n\nWait, but maybe another approach is better. In a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy the relation:\n\n4*(side length)^2 = (AC)^2 + (BD)^2\n\nBut since all sides are equal, let's denote the side length as s.\n\nSo, 4s\u00b2 = (AC)^2 + (BD)^2\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the area is (AC * BD)/2, and each side can be found using the Pythagorean theorem based on the halves of the diagonals.\n\nYes, so each side is sqrt[(AC/2)^2 + (BD/2)^2], so squared, each side squared is (AC\u00b2 + BD\u00b2)/4. So, 4*(side squared) = AC\u00b2 + BD\u00b2. So, that's correct.\n\nBut since all sides are equal, that equation holds.\n\nBut perhaps instead of focusing on the sides, I can find relations between a, b, c, d.\n\nWe have the condition from the diagonals being perpendicular: ac + bd = 0.\n\nAlso, points A and B lie on the hyperbola, so:\n\na\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nc\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nWe also know that the sides are equal, so the distance from A to B equals the distance from B to C.\n\nWait, let's compute distance AB squared.\n\nAB squared is (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2.\n\nSimilarly, BC squared is (c - (-a))^2 + (d - (-b))^2 = (c + a)^2 + (d + b)^2.\n\nSince AB = BC, their squares are equal:\n\n(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: a\u00b2 - 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2bd + d\u00b2\n\nRight side: a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2\n\nSubtract left side from right side:\n\n( a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2 ) - ( a\u00b2 - 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2bd + d\u00b2 ) = 4ac + 4bd = 0\n\nSo, 4ac + 4bd = 0 \u2192 ac + bd = 0\n\nWhich is the same condition as before. So, that doesn't give us any new information.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need another condition. Since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides are equal, but maybe the vectors AB and AD should have the same magnitude.\n\nWait, point A is (a, b), point B is (c, d), point D is (-c, -d).\n\nSo, vector AB is (c - a, d - b), vector AD is (-c - a, -d - b)\n\nThe magnitudes should be equal:\n\nsqrt( (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 ) = sqrt( (-c - a)^2 + (-d - b)^2 )\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 = ( -c - a )^2 + ( -d - b )^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft: c\u00b2 - 2ac + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - 2bd + b\u00b2\n\nRight: c\u00b2 + 2ac + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + 2bd + b\u00b2\n\nSetting equal:\n\nc\u00b2 - 2ac + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - 2bd + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2 + 2ac + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + 2bd + b\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2ac - 2bd = 2ac + 2bd\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n-4ac -4bd = 0 \u2192 ac + bd = 0\n\nAgain, same condition. So, perhaps this isn't giving us new information either.\n\nSo, perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nLet me consider parametrizing points A and B. Since the hyperbola is symmetric, maybe I can use parametric equations for the hyperbola.\n\nThe standard parametrization for hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1 is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). So, for our case, a\u00b2=20, so a=2\u221a5, and b\u00b2=24, so b=2\u221a6.\n\nSo, points on the hyperbola can be written as (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). Let me denote point A as (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). Then, point C is (-2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan\u03b8).\n\nNow, since the diagonals are AC and BD, and they are perpendicular, the other diagonal BD must be perpendicular to AC.\n\nThe slope of AC can be calculated from points A and C. Wait, but AC is a line from A to C, which is from (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) to (-2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). So, the slope of AC is [ (-2\u221a6 tan\u03b8 - 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) ] / [ (-2\u221a5 sec\u03b8 - 2\u221a5 sec\u03b8) ] = [ -4\u221a6 tan\u03b8 ] / [ -4\u221a5 sec\u03b8 ] = (\u221a6/\u221a5) tan\u03b8 sec\u03b8^{-1} ?\n\nWait, let's compute it properly.\n\nSlope m_AC = (y_C - y_A)/(x_C - x_A) = ( -2\u221a6 tan\u03b8 - 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8 ) / ( -2\u221a5 sec\u03b8 - 2\u221a5 sec\u03b8 ) = ( -4\u221a6 tan\u03b8 ) / ( -4\u221a5 sec\u03b8 ) = (\u221a6 tan\u03b8)/(\u221a5 sec\u03b8 )\n\nSimplify: tan\u03b8 / sec\u03b8 = sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, m_AC = (\u221a6 / \u221a5) sin\u03b8.\n\nSince BD is perpendicular to AC, its slope m_BD is the negative reciprocal of m_AC.\n\nSo, m_BD = - (\u221a5 / \u221a6 ) / sin\u03b8.\n\nBut BD is a diagonal passing through the origin, so the line BD has the equation y = m_BD x.\n\nSo, points B and D lie on this line and on the hyperbola.\n\nLet me denote point B as (x, y) lying on both the hyperbola and the line y = m_BD x.\n\nSo, substituting into the hyperbola equation:\n\nx\u00b2 / 20 - (m_BD x)^2 / 24 = 1\n\nWhich is:\n\nx\u00b2 / 20 - ( (5/6) / sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) x\u00b2 / 24 = 1\n\nWait, hold on. Let me compute m_BD correctly.\n\nEarlier, m_AC was (\u221a6 / \u221a5) sin\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, m_BD = - (\u221a5 / \u221a6 ) / sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, m_BD = - (\u221a5)/(\u221a6 sin\u03b8 )\n\nSo, m_BD squared is (5)/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nSo, substituting into the hyperbola equation for point B:\n\nx\u00b2 / 20 - ( (5)/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) x\u00b2 ) /24 = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (5)/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 * 24) ] = 1\n\nCompute the coefficient:\n\n1/20 - (5)/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\n= (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 5 * 20 ) / (20 * 144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nWait, maybe a better approach.\n\nCompute:\n\n1/20 - (5)/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 *24 ) = 1/20 - 5/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nSo, x\u00b2 [ 1/20 - 5/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] = 1\n\nThen, x\u00b2 = 1 / [ 1/20 - 5/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ]\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\nFind a common denominator for 1/20 and 5/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nWhich is 20 * 144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nSo,\n\n1/20 = (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) / (2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\n5/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) = (5 * 20 ) / (2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) = 100 / (2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nSo, denominator becomes:\n\n(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 ) / 2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 = 1 / [ (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 ) / 2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] = 2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 )\n\nSimilarly, x is non-zero, so we can write:\n\nx\u00b2 = [2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ] / [144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 ]\n\nSimilarly, since point B is on the hyperbola, this must be positive, so denominator must be positive:\n\n144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 > 0 \u2192 sin\u00b2\u03b8 > 100/144 \u2192 sin\u03b8 > 10/12 or sin\u03b8 < -10/12.\n\nBut sin\u03b8 cannot exceed 1, so 10/12 is 5/6 \u2248 0.8333. So, sin\u03b8 must be \u2265 5/6 or \u2264 -5/6.\n\nSo, \u03b8 must be in the range where sin\u03b8 is \u2265 5/6 or \u2264 -5/6.\n\nSo, that's an important condition.\n\nSo, moving on, x\u00b2 is 2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 )\n\nSimilarly, since y = m_BD x, then y\u00b2 = m_BD\u00b2 x\u00b2.\n\nWhich is:\n\ny\u00b2 = [5/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] * x\u00b2\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = [5/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] * [2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 ) ] \n\nSimplify:\n\nThe sin\u00b2\u03b8 cancels out:\n\ny\u00b2 = (5 * 2880 ) / (6 (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 ) )\n\n= (5 * 480 ) / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 )\n\n= 2400 / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 )\n\nSo, point B is (x, y) = ( sqrt(2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 )) , sqrt(2400 / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 )) )\n\nBut since the hyperbola is symmetric, we can consider \u03b8 in a certain range, say 0 < \u03b8 < \u03c0/2, but considering sin\u03b8 \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, \u03b8 is between arcsin(5/6) and \u03c0/2.\n\nNow, the length BD is the distance between points B and D. Since D is (-x, -y), BD is the distance from (x, y) to (-x, -y), which is sqrt( (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 ) = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 ))^2 = 4(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nSo, let's compute BD\u00b2.\n\nFrom above, x\u00b2 = 2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 )\n\nAnd y\u00b2 = 2400 / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 )\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = [2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 2400 ] / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 )\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 2400 = 2400 + 2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 240(10 + 12 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nDenominator: 144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 = 4(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25 )\n\nWait, 144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = (12 sin\u03b8 )\u00b2, 100 =10\u00b2. Hmm, perhaps factor differently.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to write as:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = [2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 2400 ] / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 )\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 2400 + 2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 240(10 + 12 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nDenominator: 144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 = 4(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 )\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = [240(10 + 12 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] / [4(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 ) ] = [60(10 + 12 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] / [36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 ]\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 ) = 4 * [60(10 + 12 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] / [36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 ] \n\nSimplify:\n\n4 * 60 = 240, so:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 240(10 + 12 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 )\n\nLet me denote sin\u00b2\u03b8 as s for simplicity.\n\nSo, s \u2265 (5/6)^2 = 25/36 \u2248 0.6944.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 240(10 + 12 s ) / (36 s -25 )\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 240 * [10 +12s ] / [36s -25 ]\n\nWe can factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 10 +12s = 2*(5 +6s )\n\nDenominator: 36s -25 = 9*(4s) -25. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 240*(10 +12s)/(36s -25 )\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 10 +12s = 2*(5 +6s )\n\nDenominator: 36s -25 = 36s -25.\n\nNot sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let me write 10 +12s = A*(36s -25 ) + B.\n\nWait, perhaps perform polynomial division or express as a linear function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps write BD\u00b2 as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 240*(10 +12s)/(36s -25 )\n\nLet me see if I can manipulate this expression.\n\nLet me write 10 +12s as (12s +10 ) = (12s - (25/3) + (10 +25/3 )) ?\n\nWait, maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me factor 12 from numerator:\n\n12s +10 = 12(s + 10/12 ) = 12(s + 5/6 )\n\nDenominator: 36s -25 = 9*(4s) -25.\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps make substitution t = s.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 240*(12t +10)/(36t -25 )\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 240*(12t +10)/(36t -25 )\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 12t +10 = 2*(6t +5 )\n\nDenominator: 36t -25 = 9*(4t) -25.\n\nHmm, not much better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 240*(12t +10)/(36t -25 ) = 240*( (12t +10) / (36t -25) )\n\nLet me factor 12 from numerator:\n\n= 240*(12(t + 10/12 )) / (36t -25 )\n\n= 240*(12(t + 5/6 )) / (36t -25 )\n\n= 240*12*(t +5/6 ) / (36t -25 )\n\n= 2880*(t +5/6 ) / (36t -25 )\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express as:\n\nLet me write 36t -25 = 36(t - 25/36 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 240*(12t +10 ) / [36(t -25/36 ) ]\n\n= 240*(12t +10 ) / [36t -25 ]\n\n= 240*(12t +10 ) / [36(t -25/36 ) ]\n\n= (240/36)*(12t +10 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\n= (20/3)*(12t +10 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nHmm, maybe.\n\nWait, 12t +10 = 12(t + 10/12 ) = 12(t + 5/6 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = (20/3)*(12(t +5/6 )) / (t -25/36 )\n\n= (20/3)*(12(t +5/6 )) / (t -25/36 )\n\nSimplify 12 and 20/3:\n\n12 * (20/3) = 80.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, actually:\n\n(20/3) * 12 = 80.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 80*(t +5/6 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80*(t +5/6 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nHmm, that's better.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80*(t +5/6 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nWhere t = s = sin\u00b2\u03b8, and t \u2265 25/36.\n\nSo, t \u2265 25/36 \u2248 0.6944.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 80*(t +5/6 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nLet me compute the expression (t +5/6 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nFirst, let me convert 5/6 and 25/36 to have a common denominator.\n\n5/6 = 30/36\n\n25/36 is as it is.\n\nSo,\n\n(t +30/36 ) / (t -25/36 ) = (t +30/36 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\n= [ (t -25/36 ) + 55/36 ] / (t -25/36 )\n\n= 1 + (55/36 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nSo,\n\n(t +30/36 ) / (t -25/36 ) = 1 + (55/36 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 = 80 * [ 1 + (55/36 ) / (t -25/36 ) ]\n\n= 80 + 80*(55/36 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nSimplify 80*(55/36 ):\n\n80 = 16*5, 55=11*5, 36=12*3.\n\nSo,\n\n80*(55/36 ) = (16*5)*(11*5)/(12*3 ) = (16*11*25 )/(12*3 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n16/12 = 4/3,\n\nSo,\n\n(4/3)*(11*25)/(3 ) = (4*11*25 )/(9 )\n\n4*11=44, 44*25=1100,\n\nSo, 1100 /9 \u2248 122.222...\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + (1100/9 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\n= 80 + (1100/9 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + (1100/9 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nNow, since t \u226525/36, the denominator (t -25/36 ) is non-negative.\n\nTo minimize BD\u00b2, we need to maximize the second term, which would require minimizing (t -25/36 ). Because as t approaches 25/36 from above, (t -25/36 ) approaches zero, making the second term very large, thus BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem says to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily large, but perhaps there's a lower bound?\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, when t increases, (t -25/36 ) increases, so the second term (1100/9 ) / (t -25/36 ) decreases. So, BD\u00b2 approaches 80 as t approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but t = sin\u00b2\u03b8, which is at most 1. So, t can go up to 1.\n\nSo, when t approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches:\n\n80 + (1100/9 ) / (1 -25/36 ) = 80 + (1100/9 ) / (11/36 )\n\nCompute 11/36 is denominator.\n\nSo, (1100/9 ) / (11/36 ) = (1100/9 ) * (36/11 ) = (1100 * 36 ) / (9 *11 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n1100 /11 = 100,\n\n36 /9 =4,\n\nSo, 100 *4=400.\n\nThus, when t approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches 80 +400=480.\n\nWait, but when t approaches 25/36 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity. So, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large by choosing t close to 25/36.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that is, the infimum of BD\u00b2, because BD\u00b2 can be made as large as desired, but perhaps there's a minimum value.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when t increases, BD\u00b2 decreases towards 80. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 80, but when t approaches infinity, but t is limited to t \u22641. So, as t approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nWait, no, hold on.\n\nWait, earlier computation:\n\nWhen t approaches 1,\n\nBD\u00b2 approaches 80 +400=480.\n\nWhen t approaches 25/36 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be made as large as desired, but the minimal BD\u00b2 is 80, achieved when t approaches infinity, but t is limited to 1. Wait, no, t cannot exceed 1 because sin\u00b2\u03b8 cannot exceed 1.\n\nWait, when t approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut when t approaches 25/36 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWait, so BD\u00b2 can be as small as 80, but wait, when t approaches infinity, but t is bounded by 1. So, as t increases from 25/36 to 1, BD\u00b2 decreases from infinity to 480.\n\nWait, so the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, but wait, when t approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, but as t approaches 25/36 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because when t is larger, BD\u00b2 is smaller.\n\nWait, let me recast BD\u00b2.\n\nWe have BD\u00b2 = 80 + (1100/9 ) / (t -25/36 )\n\nAs t increases, the term (t -25/36 ) increases, so the second term decreases, so BD\u00b2 approaches 80 from above.\n\nWait, but t is at maximum 1, so when t =1, BD\u00b2 =80 + (1100/9 )/(1 -25/36 ) =80 + (1100/9)/(11/36 )=80 + (1100/9)*(36/11 )=80 + (100*4)= 80 +400=480.\n\nSo, when t=1, BD\u00b2=480.\n\nBut wait, if t approaches infinity, but t is limited to 1, so as t increases from 25/36 to 1, BD\u00b2 decreases from infinity to 480.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, and it can be made arbitrarily large.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, but can be made larger, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, but can be larger. Wait, but that's not correct because BD\u00b2 can be larger, but the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\".\n\nWait, so we need the supremum of the lower bounds. The infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480. Because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, so 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When t approaches 25/36 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity. So, BD\u00b2 can be made as large as desired. But when t approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 480, achieved when t=1.\n\nTherefore, for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 \u2265480.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". So, if BD\u00b2 can be 480 and more, then 480 is the infimum, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480. So, 480 is the minimal possible BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but in our earlier computation, when t=1, BD\u00b2=480.\n\nSo, yes, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, so 480 is the infimum.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nWait, when t approaches 25/36 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity. So, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large. So, the supremum of BD\u00b2 is infinity, but the infimum is 480.\n\nSo, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 is always at least 480.\n\nHence, the answer is 480.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus \\(ABCD\\) inscribed in the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) are perpendicular, and all four vertices lie on the hyperbola.\n\n### Key Steps:\n\n1. **Hyperbola Parametrization**: Points on the hyperbola can be parametrized using \\((2\\sqrt{5} \\sec\\theta, 2\\sqrt{6} \\tan\\theta)\\). Let \\(A = (2\\sqrt{5} \\sec\\theta, 2\\sqrt{6} \\tan\\theta)\\) and \\(C = (-2\\sqrt{5} \\sec\\theta, -2\\sqrt{6} \\tan\\theta)\\).\n\n2. **Perpendicular Diagonals**: The slope of diagonal \\(AC\\) is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{5}} \\sin\\theta\\). Since \\(BD\\) is perpendicular to \\(AC\\), its slope is \\(-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{6} \\sin\\theta}\\).\n\n3. **Coordinates of \\(B\\) and \\(D\\)**: Points \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) lie on the line \\(y = -\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{6} \\sin\\theta} x\\) and satisfy the hyperbola equation. Solving for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), we find the coordinates of \\(B\\).\n\n4. **Length of \\(BD\\)**: The length \\(BD\\) is calculated as \\(2\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\). After simplifying, we find \\(BD^2 = \\frac{240(10 + 12\\sin^2\\theta)}{36\\sin^2\\theta - 25}\\).\n\n5. **Minimizing \\(BD^2\\)**: By analyzing the expression for \\(BD^2\\) as a function of \\(\\sin^2\\theta\\), we determine that the minimal value of \\(BD^2\\) is achieved when \\(\\sin^2\\theta = 1\\), giving \\(BD^2 = 480\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is \\(\\boxed{480}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Alright, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.\n\nWe have points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. We need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, we're looking for the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is the greatest lower bound for BD\u00b2 across all possible such rhombuses.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me recall some properties of rhombuses. In a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, actually, is that true for all rhombuses? Or is that only for squares? No, wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me double-check.\n\nNo, wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. But wait, actually, I think they are. Because in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Let me confirm. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So that's a key property.\n\nSo, for rhombus ABCD with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at the origin, which is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then the coordinates of the points must be arranged such that the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.\n\nSo, if we denote the coordinates of A, B, C, D as (x\u2081, y\u2081), (x\u2082, y\u2082), (x\u2083, y\u2083), (x\u2084, y\u2084), then since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the midpoint of AC is the origin, so (x\u2081 + x\u2083)/2 = 0, and (y\u2081 + y\u2083)/2 = 0. Similarly, for BD, (x\u2082 + x\u2084)/2 = 0 and (y\u2082 + y\u2084)/2 = 0. Therefore, we have that C is the reflection of A across the origin, so C = (-x\u2081, -y\u2081). Similarly, D is the reflection of B, so D = (-x\u2082, -y\u2082).\n\nSo, the four points are A, B, C=(-x\u2081, -y\u2081), D=(-x\u2082, -y\u2082).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the lengths of AB, BC, CD, DA must be equal.\n\nBut since the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes and the origin, it might be easier to consider that points A and B are in some symmetric positions.\n\nWait, another thought: since all four points lie on the hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin, perhaps we can parameterize the points in terms of some variables.\n\nLet me think about parametrizing points on a hyperbola. For hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a parametrization can be (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), but that's for one branch. Alternatively, we can use hyperbola functions, but maybe that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, since the points are arranged as a rhombus, perhaps it's better to consider the vectors.\n\nLet me denote vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. Since ABCD is a rhombus, vectors OA and OB are such that AB = BC, etc. Wait, perhaps I should model the rhombus in terms of vectors.\n\nIn a rhombus, the sides can be represented as vectors. So, if points A, B, C, D are in order, then vectors AB and AD should have the same magnitude, and the sides should be equal.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to consider that the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin, which is their midpoint. So, points A and C are at (x, y) and (-x, -y), and points B and D are at (u, v) and (-u, -v).\n\nSo, the four points are (x, y), (u, v), (-x, -y), (-u, -v). Now, for these four points to form a rhombus, the sides must all have the same length. So, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, and so on.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to note that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular.\n\nWait, but AC is from A to C, which is (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y), but the vector AC is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from B to D, which is (-u - u, -v - v) = (-2u, -2v). So, the diagonals are along vectors AC and BD, which are (-2x, -2y) and (-2u, -2v).\n\nFor these diagonals to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero. So,\n\n(-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 0\n=> 4xu + 4yv = 0\n=> xu + yv = 0.\n\nSo, that's one condition.\n\nAnother condition is that the sides of the rhombus are equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, etc.\n\nLet me compute AB\u00b2 and BC\u00b2.\n\nPoint A: (x, y)\nPoint B: (u, v)\nPoint C: (-x, -y)\nPoint D: (-u, -v)\n\nSo, AB\u00b2 = (u - x)\u00b2 + (v - y)\u00b2\nBC\u00b2 = (-x - u)\u00b2 + (-y - v)\u00b2\nCD\u00b2 = (-u + x)\u00b2 + (-v + y)\u00b2\nDA\u00b2 = (x + u)\u00b2 + (y + v)\u00b2\n\nSince it's a rhombus, all these should be equal.\n\nSo, AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2 = CD\u00b2 = DA\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute AB\u00b2 and BC\u00b2.\n\nAB\u00b2 = (u - x)\u00b2 + (v - y)\u00b2\n= u\u00b2 - 2ux + x\u00b2 + v\u00b2 - 2vy + y\u00b2\n\nBC\u00b2 = (-x - u)\u00b2 + (-y - v)\u00b2\n= (x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2\n= x\u00b2 + 2ux + u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2vy + v\u00b2\n\nSo, set AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2:\n\nu\u00b2 - 2ux + x\u00b2 + v\u00b2 - 2vy + y\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2ux + u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2vy + v\u00b2\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft side: x\u00b2 + u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2ux - 2vy\nRight side: x\u00b2 + u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2ux + 2vy\n\nSubtracting left side from right side:\n\n(2ux + 2vy) - (-2ux - 2vy) = 4ux + 4vy = 0\n\nSo, 4ux + 4vy = 0 => ux + vy = 0.\n\nWait, but earlier we had xu + yv = 0 from the diagonals being perpendicular. So, this is consistent. So, the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular is the same as the condition that the sides are equal? Interesting.\n\nSo, perhaps this suggests that in our case, the rhombus must have perpendicular diagonals. Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are always perpendicular, right? Because in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors. So, that's a property. So, that makes sense.\n\nSo, now, another condition is that all four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, for point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\nSimilarly, point B: u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n2. u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nAnd also, from the diagonals being perpendicular, we have xu + yv = 0.\n\nAdditionally, since the four points form a rhombus, the sides must be equal. But we already have that condition covered because of the diagonals being perpendicular.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, but not all quadrilaterals with perpendicular diagonals are rhombuses. So, perhaps in our case, because the points lie on the hyperbola and the diagonals intersect at the origin, the rhombus is determined by these conditions.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parameterize the points A and B as (x, y) and (u, v), with the conditions:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n2. u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1\n3. xu + yv = 0\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD.\n\nPoint B is (u, v), point D is (-u, -v). So, BD is the distance between (u, v) and (-u, -v), which is sqrt[(u - (-u))\u00b2 + (v - (-v))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2u)^2 + (2v)^2] = 2*sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 = (2*sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSo, we need to find BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nWe need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, i.e., the smallest possible value of BD\u00b2, such that all conditions are satisfied. So, we're to minimize 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2) given that u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1, and xu + yv = 0, where x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 as well.\n\nBut we have two variables here: x, y, u, v. But the problem is symmetric for points A and B, so perhaps we can find a relationship between x, y, u, v.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider that points A and B are such that vectors OA and OB are related via the condition xu + yv = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps we can express u and v in terms of x and y, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, since we have two hyperbola equations and one linear equation, maybe we can solve for variables.\n\nLet me see. Let me denote equation 3 as xu + yv = 0.\n\nWe can express u in terms of v, or v in terms of u.\n\nFrom equation 3: xu = -yv => u = (-yv)/x.\n\nBut then, plug this into equation 2: u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo,\n\n[ (-yv / x )\u00b2 ] /20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nWhich is:\n\n(y\u00b2 v\u00b2)/(20 x\u00b2) - v\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nFactor out v\u00b2:\n\nv\u00b2 [ y\u00b2/(20x\u00b2) - 1/24 ] = 1\n\nSo,\n\nv\u00b2 = 1 / [ y\u00b2/(20x\u00b2) - 1/24 ]\n\nSimilarly, from equation 1: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nLet me denote equation 1 as:\n\nx\u00b2 = 20(1 + y\u00b2/24)\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (20 y\u00b2)/24 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6)y\u00b2.\n\nSo, plugging back into the expression for v\u00b2:\n\nv\u00b2 = 1 / [ y\u00b2/(20x\u00b2) - 1/24 ]\n\nSubstituting x\u00b2 from above:\n\nv\u00b2 = 1 / [ y\u00b2 / (20*(20 + (5/6)y\u00b2)) - 1/24 ]\n\nLet me compute the denominator:\n\nDenominator = [ y\u00b2 / (20*(20 + (5/6)y\u00b2)) ] - 1/24\n\nLet me compute 20*(20 + (5/6)y\u00b2) = 400 + (100/6)y\u00b2 = 400 + (50/3)y\u00b2\n\nSo, Denominator = [ y\u00b2 / (400 + (50/3)y\u00b2) ] - 1/24\n\nLet me write both terms with a common denominator:\n\nFirst term: y\u00b2 / (400 + (50/3)y\u00b2) = (3 y\u00b2) / (1200 + 50 y\u00b2)\n\nSecond term: 1/24 = (50 y\u00b2) / (1200 + 50 y\u00b2)  [Wait, no. Let me see: 1/24 = (something)/(1200 +50 y\u00b2). Hmm, perhaps not the best approach.]\n\nAlternatively, let me express both terms over a common denominator:\n\nLet me denote D = 400 + (50/3)y\u00b2.\n\nThen Denominator = [ y\u00b2 / D ] - 1/24\n\nCompute common denominator 24D:\n\n= (24 y\u00b2 - D) / (24 D)\n\nSo,\n\nDenominator = (24 y\u00b2 - D) / (24 D)\n\nBut D = 400 + (50/3)y\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\n24 y\u00b2 - D = 24 y\u00b2 - 400 - (50/3)y\u00b2 = (24 - 50/3)y\u00b2 - 400\n\nCompute 24 as 72/3, so 72/3 - 50/3 = 22/3.\n\nSo,\n\n24 y\u00b2 - D = (22/3)y\u00b2 - 400\n\nSo, Denominator = [ (22/3)y\u00b2 - 400 ] / (24 D )\n\nThus,\n\nv\u00b2 = 1 / [ (22/3 y\u00b2 - 400) / (24 D ) ] = 24 D / (22/3 y\u00b2 - 400 )\n\nBut D = 400 + (50/3)y\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nv\u00b2 = 24*(400 + (50/3)y\u00b2) / ( (22/3)y\u00b2 - 400 )\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 24*(400 + (50/3)y\u00b2) = 24*400 + 24*(50/3)y\u00b2 = 9600 + 400 y\u00b2\n\nDenominator: (22/3)y\u00b2 - 400 = (22 y\u00b2 - 1200)/3\n\nSo,\n\nv\u00b2 = (9600 + 400 y\u00b2) / [ (22 y\u00b2 - 1200)/3 ] = 3*(9600 + 400 y\u00b2)/(22 y\u00b2 - 1200 )\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 9600 + 400 y\u00b2 = 400*(24 + y\u00b2)\nDenominator: 22 y\u00b2 - 1200 = 22 y\u00b2 - 1200 = 2*(11 y\u00b2 - 600)\n\nWait, 22 y\u00b2 - 1200 = 2*(11 y\u00b2 - 600). Hmm, 22 is 2*11, 1200 is 2*600.\n\nSo,\n\nv\u00b2 = 3 * [400 (24 + y\u00b2)] / [ 2 (11 y\u00b2 - 600) ) ] = (3 * 400 / 2 ) * (24 + y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(600) * (24 + y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nSo,\n\nv\u00b2 = 600*(24 + y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nHmm, so now we have v\u00b2 expressed in terms of y\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute u\u00b2.\n\nFrom equation 3: xu + yv = 0 => u = (-yv)/x.\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2 = (y\u00b2 v\u00b2)/x\u00b2.\n\nBut from equation 1, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6)y\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2 = (y\u00b2 v\u00b2)/(20 + (5/6)y\u00b2) = (y\u00b2 v\u00b2)/( (120 + 5 y\u00b2)/6 ) = (6 y\u00b2 v\u00b2)/(120 + 5 y\u00b2 ) = (6 y\u00b2 v\u00b2)/(5 (24 + y\u00b2 )) = (6/5) * ( y\u00b2 v\u00b2 )/(24 + y\u00b2 )\n\nSo, u\u00b2 = (6/5)*( y\u00b2 v\u00b2 )/(24 + y\u00b2 )\n\nBut from above, we have v\u00b2 expressed as 600*(24 + y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2 = (6/5) * y\u00b2 * [600*(24 + y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 ) ] / (24 + y\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nu\u00b2 = (6/5) * y\u00b2 * [600/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 ) ]\n\nSimplify 6/5 * 600 = (6*600)/5 = 720.\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2 = 720 y\u00b2 / (11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nSo, now we have u\u00b2 and v\u00b2 in terms of y\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 ) = 4 [ (720 y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 ) + 600*(24 + y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 ) ]\n\nWait, because v\u00b2 = 600*(24 + y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 ), and u\u00b2 = 720 y\u00b2/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nSo, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = [720 y\u00b2 + 600*(24 + y\u00b2 ) ] / (11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n720 y\u00b2 + 600*(24 + y\u00b2 ) = 720 y\u00b2 + 14400 + 600 y\u00b2 = (720 + 600) y\u00b2 + 14400 = 1320 y\u00b2 + 14400\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = (1320 y\u00b2 + 14400)/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n1320 y\u00b2 + 14400 = 120*(11 y\u00b2 + 120 )\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = 120*(11 y\u00b2 + 120 ) / (11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nThus,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * [120*(11 y\u00b2 + 120 ) / (11 y\u00b2 - 600 ) ] = 480*(11 y\u00b2 + 120 ) / (11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nLet me write BD\u00b2 as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480*(11 y\u00b2 + 120 ) / (11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nLet me denote z = y\u00b2. Then,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480*(11 z + 120 ) / (11 z - 600 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(z) = 480*(11 z + 120 ) / (11 z - 600 )\n\nOur goal is to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all permissible z.\n\nBut we must ensure that the denominators are non-zero and that the expressions under the square roots are positive.\n\nFirst, let's find the domain of z.\n\nFrom the hyperbola equation, for point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, so y\u00b2 must satisfy y\u00b2 = 24(x\u00b2/20 - 1). Since x\u00b2 can be any real number greater than or equal to 20, y\u00b2 can be any real number greater than or equal to 0. Wait, no. Wait, for hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, the points are on the hyperbola, so x can be any real number such that x\u00b2 >= a\u00b2, so y\u00b2 = b\u00b2(x\u00b2/a\u00b2 -1). So, y\u00b2 >= 0 is automatically satisfied.\n\nBut in our case, the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, so y\u00b2 =24*(x\u00b2/20 -1) = (24/20)x\u00b2 -24 = (6/5)x\u00b2 -24.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 must be >=0, so (6/5)x\u00b2 -24 >=0 => x\u00b2 >=20, which is consistent with the hyperbola.\n\nSo, for point A, y\u00b2 can be any real number such that y\u00b2 >= (6/5)x\u00b2 -24, but x\u00b2 >=20, so y\u00b2 >= (6/5)*20 -24 =24 -24=0. So, y\u00b2 >=0.\n\nSimilarly, for point B, same condition.\n\nBut in our expressions, we have z = y\u00b2, and in BD\u00b2(z), the denominator is 11 z -600.\n\nSo, denominator 11 z -600 must not be zero, so z \u2260 600/11 \u224854.545.\n\nAdditionally, since we're dealing with real points, the denominator must not be zero, and also, the expressions for u\u00b2 and v\u00b2 must be positive.\n\nFrom u\u00b2 =720 z/(11 z -600 ), for u\u00b2 to be positive, numerator and denominator must have the same sign.\n\nSimilarly, for v\u00b2 =600*(24 + z )/(11 z -600 ), same here.\n\nSo, let's analyze the expressions.\n\nFirst, let's consider u\u00b2:\n\nu\u00b2 =720 z / (11 z -600 )\n\nFor u\u00b2 to be positive, 720 z and (11 z -600 ) must have the same sign.\n\nSimilarly, v\u00b2=600*(24 + z )/(11 z -600 )\n\nFor v\u00b2 to be positive, numerator and denominator must have same sign.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nCase 1: 11 z -600 >0 => z >600/11\u224854.545\n\nThen, for u\u00b2: 720 z >0 since z>0, which is true.\n\nFor v\u00b2: 600*(24 + z ) >0 since 24 + z >0, which is true.\n\nSo, both u\u00b2 and v\u00b2 are positive when z>600/11.\n\nCase 2: 11 z -600 <0 => z <600/11.\n\nThen, for u\u00b2: 720 z must be negative, but z is y\u00b2 >=0. So, 720 z >=0, but denominator is negative. So, u\u00b2 would be negative, which is impossible. Similarly, for v\u00b2, 600*(24 + z ) is positive, but denominator is negative, so v\u00b2 would be negative, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, only Case 1 is possible: z>600/11.\n\nSo, z must be greater than 600/11 \u224854.545.\n\nSo, our domain is z>600/11.\n\nNow, we can write BD\u00b2(z)=480*(11 z +120)/(11 z -600 )\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2(z) =480*(11 z +120)/(11 z -600 )\n\nLet me factor out 11 from numerator and denominator:\n\nBD\u00b2(z) =480*(11(z) +120)/(11(z) -600 )\n\nLet me denote t =11 z. Then, since z>600/11, t>600.\n\nExpress BD\u00b2 in terms of t:\n\nt =11 z => z = t/11\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 =480*(t +120)/(t -600 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(t) =480*(t +120)/(t -600 ), t>600.\n\nNow, we can simplify BD\u00b2(t):\n\nBD\u00b2(t)=480*(t +120)/(t -600 )\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2(t)=480*[ (t -600 + 720 )/(t -600 ) ] =480*[1 + 720/(t -600 ) ]\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2(t)=480 + (480*720)/(t -600 )\n\nWhich is,\n\nBD\u00b2(t)=480 + (345600)/(t -600 )\n\nSo, as t approaches 600 from above, the second term becomes very large, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nAs t approaches infinity, the second term approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is approached as t approaches infinity, which is 480.\n\nBut wait, let's check if BD\u00b2 can actually be 480. Since t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, but never actually reaches it.\n\nTherefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, when t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, but for any finite t>600, BD\u00b2 is greater than 480. So, 480 is the infimum.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, the greatest lower bound is 480, so the answer is 480.\n\nBut let me verify this.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me retrace.\n\nWe had BD\u00b2=480*(t +120)/(t -600 ), t>600.\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(t +120)/(t -600 )=480*( (t -600 ) +720 )/(t -600 )=480*(1 +720/(t -600 ))=480 + (480*720)/(t -600 )\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, as t increases, the term 720/(t -600 ) decreases, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nHence, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is 480, but it's never actually achieved; it's the infimum.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses is 480.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n",

      "full_content": "Alright, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.\n\nWe have points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. We need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, we're looking for the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is the greatest lower bound for BD\u00b2 across all possible such rhombuses.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me recall some properties of rhombuses. In a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, actually, is that true for all rhombuses? Or is that only for squares? No, wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me double-check.\n\nNo, wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. But wait, actually, I think they are. Because in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Let me confirm. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So that's a key property.\n\nSo, for rhombus ABCD with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at the origin, which is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then the coordinates of the points must be arranged such that the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.\n\nSo, if we denote the coordinates of A, B, C, D as (x\u2081, y\u2081), (x\u2082, y\u2082), (x\u2083, y\u2083), (x\u2084, y\u2084), then since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the midpoint of AC is the origin, so (x\u2081 + x\u2083)/2 = 0, and (y\u2081 + y\u2083)/2 = 0. Similarly, for BD, (x\u2082 + x\u2084)/2 = 0 and (y\u2082 + y\u2084)/2 = 0. Therefore, we have that C is the reflection of A across the origin, so C = (-x\u2081, -y\u2081). Similarly, D is the reflection of B, so D = (-x\u2082, -y\u2082).\n\nSo, the four points are A, B, C=(-x\u2081, -y\u2081), D=(-x\u2082, -y\u2082).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the lengths of AB, BC, CD, DA must be equal.\n\nBut since the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes and the origin, it might be easier to consider that points A and B are in some symmetric positions.\n\nWait, another thought: since all four points lie on the hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin, perhaps we can parameterize the points in terms of some variables.\n\nLet me think about parametrizing points on a hyperbola. For hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a parametrization can be (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), but that's for one branch. Alternatively, we can use hyperbola functions, but maybe that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, since the points are arranged as a rhombus, perhaps it's better to consider the vectors.\n\nLet me denote vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. Since ABCD is a rhombus, vectors OA and OB are such that AB = BC, etc. Wait, perhaps I should model the rhombus in terms of vectors.\n\nIn a rhombus, the sides can be represented as vectors. So, if points A, B, C, D are in order, then vectors AB and AD should have the same magnitude, and the sides should be equal.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to consider that the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin, which is their midpoint. So, points A and C are at (x, y) and (-x, -y), and points B and D are at (u, v) and (-u, -v).\n\nSo, the four points are (x, y), (u, v), (-x, -y), (-u, -v). Now, for these four points to form a rhombus, the sides must all have the same length. So, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, and so on.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to note that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular.\n\nWait, but AC is from A to C, which is (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y), but the vector AC is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from B to D, which is (-u - u, -v - v) = (-2u, -2v). So, the diagonals are along vectors AC and BD, which are (-2x, -2y) and (-2u, -2v).\n\nFor these diagonals to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero. So,\n\n(-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 0\n=> 4xu + 4yv = 0\n=> xu + yv = 0.\n\nSo, that's one condition.\n\nAnother condition is that the sides of the rhombus are equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, etc.\n\nLet me compute AB\u00b2 and BC\u00b2.\n\nPoint A: (x, y)\nPoint B: (u, v)\nPoint C: (-x, -y)\nPoint D: (-u, -v)\n\nSo, AB\u00b2 = (u - x)\u00b2 + (v - y)\u00b2\nBC\u00b2 = (-x - u)\u00b2 + (-y - v)\u00b2\nCD\u00b2 = (-u + x)\u00b2 + (-v + y)\u00b2\nDA\u00b2 = (x + u)\u00b2 + (y + v)\u00b2\n\nSince it's a rhombus, all these should be equal.\n\nSo, AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2 = CD\u00b2 = DA\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute AB\u00b2 and BC\u00b2.\n\nAB\u00b2 = (u - x)\u00b2 + (v - y)\u00b2\n= u\u00b2 - 2ux + x\u00b2 + v\u00b2 - 2vy + y\u00b2\n\nBC\u00b2 = (-x - u)\u00b2 + (-y - v)\u00b2\n= (x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2\n= x\u00b2 + 2ux + u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2vy + v\u00b2\n\nSo, set AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2:\n\nu\u00b2 - 2ux + x\u00b2 + v\u00b2 - 2vy + y\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2ux + u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2vy + v\u00b2\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft side: x\u00b2 + u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2ux - 2vy\nRight side: x\u00b2 + u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2ux + 2vy\n\nSubtracting left side from right side:\n\n(2ux + 2vy) - (-2ux - 2vy) = 4ux + 4vy = 0\n\nSo, 4ux + 4vy = 0 => ux + vy = 0.\n\nWait, but earlier we had xu + yv = 0 from the diagonals being perpendicular. So, this is consistent. So, the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular is the same as the condition that the sides are equal? Interesting.\n\nSo, perhaps this suggests that in our case, the rhombus must have perpendicular diagonals. Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are always perpendicular, right? Because in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors. So, that's a property. So, that makes sense.\n\nSo, now, another condition is that all four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, for point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\nSimilarly, point B: u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n2. u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nAnd also, from the diagonals being perpendicular, we have xu + yv = 0.\n\nAdditionally, since the four points form a rhombus, the sides must be equal. But we already have that condition covered because of the diagonals being perpendicular.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, but not all quadrilaterals with perpendicular diagonals are rhombuses. So, perhaps in our case, because the points lie on the hyperbola and the diagonals intersect at the origin, the rhombus is determined by these conditions.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parameterize the points A and B as (x, y) and (u, v), with the conditions:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n2. u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1\n3. xu + yv = 0\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD.\n\nPoint B is (u, v), point D is (-u, -v). So, BD is the distance between (u, v) and (-u, -v), which is sqrt[(u - (-u))\u00b2 + (v - (-v))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2u)^2 + (2v)^2] = 2*sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 = (2*sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSo, we need to find BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nWe need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, i.e., the smallest possible value of BD\u00b2, such that all conditions are satisfied. So, we're to minimize 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2) given that u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1, and xu + yv = 0, where x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 as well.\n\nBut we have two variables here: x, y, u, v. But the problem is symmetric for points A and B, so perhaps we can find a relationship between x, y, u, v.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider that points A and B are such that vectors OA and OB are related via the condition xu + yv = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps we can express u and v in terms of x and y, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, since we have two hyperbola equations and one linear equation, maybe we can solve for variables.\n\nLet me see. Let me denote equation 3 as xu + yv = 0.\n\nWe can express u in terms of v, or v in terms of u.\n\nFrom equation 3: xu = -yv => u = (-yv)/x.\n\nBut then, plug this into equation 2: u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo,\n\n[ (-yv / x )\u00b2 ] /20 - v\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nWhich is:\n\n(y\u00b2 v\u00b2)/(20 x\u00b2) - v\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nFactor out v\u00b2:\n\nv\u00b2 [ y\u00b2/(20x\u00b2) - 1/24 ] = 1\n\nSo,\n\nv\u00b2 = 1 / [ y\u00b2/(20x\u00b2) - 1/24 ]\n\nSimilarly, from equation 1: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nLet me denote equation 1 as:\n\nx\u00b2 = 20(1 + y\u00b2/24)\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (20 y\u00b2)/24 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6)y\u00b2.\n\nSo, plugging back into the expression for v\u00b2:\n\nv\u00b2 = 1 / [ y\u00b2/(20x\u00b2) - 1/24 ]\n\nSubstituting x\u00b2 from above:\n\nv\u00b2 = 1 / [ y\u00b2 / (20*(20 + (5/6)y\u00b2)) - 1/24 ]\n\nLet me compute the denominator:\n\nDenominator = [ y\u00b2 / (20*(20 + (5/6)y\u00b2)) ] - 1/24\n\nLet me compute 20*(20 + (5/6)y\u00b2) = 400 + (100/6)y\u00b2 = 400 + (50/3)y\u00b2\n\nSo, Denominator = [ y\u00b2 / (400 + (50/3)y\u00b2) ] - 1/24\n\nLet me write both terms with a common denominator:\n\nFirst term: y\u00b2 / (400 + (50/3)y\u00b2) = (3 y\u00b2) / (1200 + 50 y\u00b2)\n\nSecond term: 1/24 = (50 y\u00b2) / (1200 + 50 y\u00b2)  [Wait, no. Let me see: 1/24 = (something)/(1200 +50 y\u00b2). Hmm, perhaps not the best approach.]\n\nAlternatively, let me express both terms over a common denominator:\n\nLet me denote D = 400 + (50/3)y\u00b2.\n\nThen Denominator = [ y\u00b2 / D ] - 1/24\n\nCompute common denominator 24D:\n\n= (24 y\u00b2 - D) / (24 D)\n\nSo,\n\nDenominator = (24 y\u00b2 - D) / (24 D)\n\nBut D = 400 + (50/3)y\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\n24 y\u00b2 - D = 24 y\u00b2 - 400 - (50/3)y\u00b2 = (24 - 50/3)y\u00b2 - 400\n\nCompute 24 as 72/3, so 72/3 - 50/3 = 22/3.\n\nSo,\n\n24 y\u00b2 - D = (22/3)y\u00b2 - 400\n\nSo, Denominator = [ (22/3)y\u00b2 - 400 ] / (24 D )\n\nThus,\n\nv\u00b2 = 1 / [ (22/3 y\u00b2 - 400) / (24 D ) ] = 24 D / (22/3 y\u00b2 - 400 )\n\nBut D = 400 + (50/3)y\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nv\u00b2 = 24*(400 + (50/3)y\u00b2) / ( (22/3)y\u00b2 - 400 )\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 24*(400 + (50/3)y\u00b2) = 24*400 + 24*(50/3)y\u00b2 = 9600 + 400 y\u00b2\n\nDenominator: (22/3)y\u00b2 - 400 = (22 y\u00b2 - 1200)/3\n\nSo,\n\nv\u00b2 = (9600 + 400 y\u00b2) / [ (22 y\u00b2 - 1200)/3 ] = 3*(9600 + 400 y\u00b2)/(22 y\u00b2 - 1200 )\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 9600 + 400 y\u00b2 = 400*(24 + y\u00b2)\nDenominator: 22 y\u00b2 - 1200 = 22 y\u00b2 - 1200 = 2*(11 y\u00b2 - 600)\n\nWait, 22 y\u00b2 - 1200 = 2*(11 y\u00b2 - 600). Hmm, 22 is 2*11, 1200 is 2*600.\n\nSo,\n\nv\u00b2 = 3 * [400 (24 + y\u00b2)] / [ 2 (11 y\u00b2 - 600) ) ] = (3 * 400 / 2 ) * (24 + y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(600) * (24 + y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nSo,\n\nv\u00b2 = 600*(24 + y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nHmm, so now we have v\u00b2 expressed in terms of y\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute u\u00b2.\n\nFrom equation 3: xu + yv = 0 => u = (-yv)/x.\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2 = (y\u00b2 v\u00b2)/x\u00b2.\n\nBut from equation 1, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6)y\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2 = (y\u00b2 v\u00b2)/(20 + (5/6)y\u00b2) = (y\u00b2 v\u00b2)/( (120 + 5 y\u00b2)/6 ) = (6 y\u00b2 v\u00b2)/(120 + 5 y\u00b2 ) = (6 y\u00b2 v\u00b2)/(5 (24 + y\u00b2 )) = (6/5) * ( y\u00b2 v\u00b2 )/(24 + y\u00b2 )\n\nSo, u\u00b2 = (6/5)*( y\u00b2 v\u00b2 )/(24 + y\u00b2 )\n\nBut from above, we have v\u00b2 expressed as 600*(24 + y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2 = (6/5) * y\u00b2 * [600*(24 + y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 ) ] / (24 + y\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nu\u00b2 = (6/5) * y\u00b2 * [600/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 ) ]\n\nSimplify 6/5 * 600 = (6*600)/5 = 720.\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2 = 720 y\u00b2 / (11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nSo, now we have u\u00b2 and v\u00b2 in terms of y\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 ) = 4 [ (720 y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 ) + 600*(24 + y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 ) ]\n\nWait, because v\u00b2 = 600*(24 + y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 ), and u\u00b2 = 720 y\u00b2/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nSo, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = [720 y\u00b2 + 600*(24 + y\u00b2 ) ] / (11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n720 y\u00b2 + 600*(24 + y\u00b2 ) = 720 y\u00b2 + 14400 + 600 y\u00b2 = (720 + 600) y\u00b2 + 14400 = 1320 y\u00b2 + 14400\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = (1320 y\u00b2 + 14400)/(11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n1320 y\u00b2 + 14400 = 120*(11 y\u00b2 + 120 )\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = 120*(11 y\u00b2 + 120 ) / (11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nThus,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * [120*(11 y\u00b2 + 120 ) / (11 y\u00b2 - 600 ) ] = 480*(11 y\u00b2 + 120 ) / (11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nLet me write BD\u00b2 as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480*(11 y\u00b2 + 120 ) / (11 y\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nLet me denote z = y\u00b2. Then,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480*(11 z + 120 ) / (11 z - 600 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(z) = 480*(11 z + 120 ) / (11 z - 600 )\n\nOur goal is to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all permissible z.\n\nBut we must ensure that the denominators are non-zero and that the expressions under the square roots are positive.\n\nFirst, let's find the domain of z.\n\nFrom the hyperbola equation, for point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, so y\u00b2 must satisfy y\u00b2 = 24(x\u00b2/20 - 1). Since x\u00b2 can be any real number greater than or equal to 20, y\u00b2 can be any real number greater than or equal to 0. Wait, no. Wait, for hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, the points are on the hyperbola, so x can be any real number such that x\u00b2 >= a\u00b2, so y\u00b2 = b\u00b2(x\u00b2/a\u00b2 -1). So, y\u00b2 >= 0 is automatically satisfied.\n\nBut in our case, the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, so y\u00b2 =24*(x\u00b2/20 -1) = (24/20)x\u00b2 -24 = (6/5)x\u00b2 -24.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 must be >=0, so (6/5)x\u00b2 -24 >=0 => x\u00b2 >=20, which is consistent with the hyperbola.\n\nSo, for point A, y\u00b2 can be any real number such that y\u00b2 >= (6/5)x\u00b2 -24, but x\u00b2 >=20, so y\u00b2 >= (6/5)*20 -24 =24 -24=0. So, y\u00b2 >=0.\n\nSimilarly, for point B, same condition.\n\nBut in our expressions, we have z = y\u00b2, and in BD\u00b2(z), the denominator is 11 z -600.\n\nSo, denominator 11 z -600 must not be zero, so z \u2260 600/11 \u224854.545.\n\nAdditionally, since we're dealing with real points, the denominator must not be zero, and also, the expressions for u\u00b2 and v\u00b2 must be positive.\n\nFrom u\u00b2 =720 z/(11 z -600 ), for u\u00b2 to be positive, numerator and denominator must have the same sign.\n\nSimilarly, for v\u00b2 =600*(24 + z )/(11 z -600 ), same here.\n\nSo, let's analyze the expressions.\n\nFirst, let's consider u\u00b2:\n\nu\u00b2 =720 z / (11 z -600 )\n\nFor u\u00b2 to be positive, 720 z and (11 z -600 ) must have the same sign.\n\nSimilarly, v\u00b2=600*(24 + z )/(11 z -600 )\n\nFor v\u00b2 to be positive, numerator and denominator must have same sign.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nCase 1: 11 z -600 >0 => z >600/11\u224854.545\n\nThen, for u\u00b2: 720 z >0 since z>0, which is true.\n\nFor v\u00b2: 600*(24 + z ) >0 since 24 + z >0, which is true.\n\nSo, both u\u00b2 and v\u00b2 are positive when z>600/11.\n\nCase 2: 11 z -600 <0 => z <600/11.\n\nThen, for u\u00b2: 720 z must be negative, but z is y\u00b2 >=0. So, 720 z >=0, but denominator is negative. So, u\u00b2 would be negative, which is impossible. Similarly, for v\u00b2, 600*(24 + z ) is positive, but denominator is negative, so v\u00b2 would be negative, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, only Case 1 is possible: z>600/11.\n\nSo, z must be greater than 600/11 \u224854.545.\n\nSo, our domain is z>600/11.\n\nNow, we can write BD\u00b2(z)=480*(11 z +120)/(11 z -600 )\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2(z) =480*(11 z +120)/(11 z -600 )\n\nLet me factor out 11 from numerator and denominator:\n\nBD\u00b2(z) =480*(11(z) +120)/(11(z) -600 )\n\nLet me denote t =11 z. Then, since z>600/11, t>600.\n\nExpress BD\u00b2 in terms of t:\n\nt =11 z => z = t/11\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 =480*(t +120)/(t -600 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(t) =480*(t +120)/(t -600 ), t>600.\n\nNow, we can simplify BD\u00b2(t):\n\nBD\u00b2(t)=480*(t +120)/(t -600 )\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2(t)=480*[ (t -600 + 720 )/(t -600 ) ] =480*[1 + 720/(t -600 ) ]\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2(t)=480 + (480*720)/(t -600 )\n\nWhich is,\n\nBD\u00b2(t)=480 + (345600)/(t -600 )\n\nSo, as t approaches 600 from above, the second term becomes very large, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nAs t approaches infinity, the second term approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is approached as t approaches infinity, which is 480.\n\nBut wait, let's check if BD\u00b2 can actually be 480. Since t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, but never actually reaches it.\n\nTherefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, when t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, but for any finite t>600, BD\u00b2 is greater than 480. So, 480 is the infimum.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, the greatest lower bound is 480, so the answer is 480.\n\nBut let me verify this.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me retrace.\n\nWe had BD\u00b2=480*(t +120)/(t -600 ), t>600.\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(t +120)/(t -600 )=480*( (t -600 ) +720 )/(t -600 )=480*(1 +720/(t -600 ))=480 + (480*720)/(t -600 )\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, as t increases, the term 720/(t -600 ) decreases, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nHence, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is 480, but it's never actually achieved; it's the infimum.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses is 480.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we consider points \\( A, B, C, D \\) on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) forming a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular and bisect each other. We aim to find the greatest lower bound for \\( BD^2 \\).\n\n1. **Hyperbola Equations**: Points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) lie on the hyperbola, so:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{u^2}{20} - \\frac{v^2}{24} = 1\n   \\]\n   where \\( A = (x, y) \\) and \\( B = (u, v) \\).\n\n2. **Perpendicular Diagonals**: The diagonals \\( AC \\) and \\( BD \\) are perpendicular, leading to:\n   \\[\n   xu + yv = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expressing \\( u \\) and \\( v \\)**: Using the hyperbola equations and the perpendicularity condition, we express \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).

Thus, the infimum of \\( BD^2 \\) is 480.\n\nThe greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombuses is \\(\\boxed{480}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, basically, I have to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, the lower bound for BD squared, but expressed as the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all possible such rhombuses.\n\nFirst, let's recall some properties of hyperbolas and rhombuses. The hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 is centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis length is 2\u221a20, which is about 8.94, and the conjugate axis is 2\u221a24, about 9.798. The asymptotes are y = \u00b1(\u221a24/\u221a20)x, which simplifies to y = \u00b1(\u221a(6/5))x, so approximately \u00b11.095x.\n\nA rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. But wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, no, wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's right. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the diagonals AC and BD of the rhombus intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola.\n\nLet me denote the points A, B, C, D as points on the hyperbola. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and since ABCD is a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. Therefore, if I let point A be (a, b), then point C would be (-a, -b), because the diagonal AC is bisected at the origin. Similarly, points B and D would be (c, d) and (-c, -d), respectively.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are not only bisected but also perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular. So, the vectors (A - C) and (B - D) should be perpendicular. But since A, C are (-a, -b) and (a, b), the vector AC is (2a, 2b). Similarly, BD is (2c, 2d). So, the dot product of AC and BD should be zero because they are perpendicular. Therefore, (2a)(2c) + (2b)(2d) = 0. Simplifying, 4(ac + bd) = 0, so ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, that's one condition: ac + bd = 0.\n\nNow, since all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, each of them must satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nSo, for point A: (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, for point B: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nAnd since C is (-a, -b), it also satisfies the same equation as A, and same for D.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the lengths AB, BC, CD, DA are equal.\n\nLet me express AB and BC in terms of coordinates.\n\nPoint A: (a, b)\n\nPoint B: (c, d)\n\nPoint C: (-a, -b)\n\nPoint D: (-c, -d)\n\nSo, the vector AB is (c - a, d - b), and the length squared is (c - a)\u00b2 + (d - b)\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, the vector BC is (-a - c, -b - d), so the length squared is (-a - c)\u00b2 + (-b - d)\u00b2 = (a + c)\u00b2 + (b + d)\u00b2.\n\nSince AB = BC, their squares are equal:\n\n(c - a)\u00b2 + (d - b)\u00b2 = (a + c)\u00b2 + (b + d)\u00b2.\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: c\u00b2 - 2ac + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - 2bd + b\u00b2\n\nRight side: a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2\n\nSet left equal to right:\n\nc\u00b2 - 2ac + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - 2bd + b\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2\n\nSimplify both sides by subtracting a\u00b2, c\u00b2, d\u00b2, b\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n-2ac - 2bd = 2ac + 2bd\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-2ac -2bd -2ac -2bd = 0\n\nWait, no. Let me rearrange:\n\n-2ac -2bd = 2ac + 2bd\n\nBring everything to the left:\n\n-2ac -2bd -2ac -2bd = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-4ac) + (-4bd) = 0\n\nSo, -4(ac + bd) = 0.\n\nBut earlier, we found that ac + bd = 0 from the perpendicular diagonals. So, this is consistent. So, that condition is already satisfied because of the perpendicular diagonals.\n\nHmm, so that condition doesn't give us new information. So, perhaps another pair of sides can give us more information.\n\nLet me check the length of AD. Point A is (a, b), point D is (-c, -d). So, vector AD is (-c - a, -d - b). The length squared is ( -c - a )\u00b2 + ( -d - b )\u00b2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2.\n\nWait, but that's the same as BC. So, in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so AB=BC=CD=DA. So, if AB squared is equal to BC squared, which we already saw, and they equal CD squared and DA squared as well.\n\nBut perhaps I need to use another pair of sides. Let me check AB and AD.\n\nWait, AB squared is (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2.\n\nAD squared is ( -c - a )^2 + ( -d - b )^2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2.\n\nSet them equal:\n\n(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft: c\u00b2 - 2ac + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - 2bd + b\u00b2\n\nRight: a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2\n\nSet equal:\n\nc\u00b2 - 2ac + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - 2bd + b\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2\n\nAgain, subtracting common terms:\n\n-2ac -2bd = 2ac + 2bd\n\nWhich again leads to -4ac -4bd = 0, which is the same as ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, again, same condition. So, perhaps this isn't giving me any new information.\n\nSo, maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nSince all four points lie on the hyperbola, perhaps I can parameterize them.\n\nWait, hyperbola parametrization: for hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, a parametrization can be (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), but that's for one branch. Alternatively, since points can be on either branch, maybe it's better to use hyperbola coordinates.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to note that the diagonals of the rhombus are along certain lines, and the points are symmetric about the origin.\n\nWait, let's think about the coordinates.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, so points A and C are symmetric about the origin, as are B and D.\n\nSo, if A is (a, b), then C is (-a, -b). Similarly, B is (c, d), and D is (-c, -d).\n\nNow, the diagonals are AC and BD.\n\nSo, the diagonals are AC: from (a, b) to (-a, -b), which is the line y = (b/a)x if a \u2260 0. Similarly, BD is from (c, d) to (-c, -d), which is the line y = (d/c)x if c \u2260 0.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nSo, (b/a) * (d/c) = -1.\n\nSo, (bd)/(ac) = -1.\n\nBut earlier, we found that ac + bd = 0, which is the same as bd = -ac.\n\nSo, (bd)/(ac) = (-ac)/ac = -1. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the condition is bd = -ac.\n\nSo, now, moving forward.\n\nEach of the points A, B, C, D must lie on the hyperbola, so:\n\nFor A: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nFor B: c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAlso, since BD is the diagonal from B to D, which is from (c, d) to (-c, -d). So, the length BD is the distance between these two points, which is sqrt[(c - (-c))\u00b2 + (d - (-d))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2c)^2 + (2d)^2] = 2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD squared is [2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2)]\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nOur goal is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of the lower bounds of BD\u00b2. That is, the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombuses is the greatest lower bound. So, the greatest number that is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. But the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2\", so perhaps it's the supremum of all numbers m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. So, if the infimum of BD\u00b2 is m, then m is the greatest lower bound, and any number less than m would also be a lower bound. But since the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi,\" perhaps it's the infimum.\n\nWait, but actually, if the infimum is m, then m is the greatest lower bound, so any number less than m would not be a lower bound. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, if m is the infimum, then for any \u03b5 > 0, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than m + \u03b5. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would be the infimum. Because if you take any number greater than the infimum, say m', then m' > m, but there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than m', so m' can't be a lower bound for all BD\u00b2. Hence, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is the infimum.\n\nSo, I think the problem is asking for the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is the greatest lower bound.\n\nSo, I need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, which is 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), given the constraints that points A(a, b) and B(c, d) lie on the hyperbola, and that ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, let me restate the problem in terms of optimization.\n\nWe need to minimize BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), subject to:\n\n1. a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1\n2. c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1\n3. ac + bd = 0\n\nSo, we have four variables: a, b, c, d. But they are related by the three equations above.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express some variables in terms of others.\n\nFrom equation 3: ac + bd = 0. Let me solve for one variable in terms of others, say, d.\n\nFrom equation 3: d = (-ac)/b.\n\nBut from equation 1: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1. Let me express b\u00b2 in terms of a\u00b2.\n\nFrom equation 1: b\u00b2 = (24/20)a\u00b2 - 24 = (6/5)a\u00b2 - 24.\n\nWait, let me do that again. Equation 1: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1. Multiply both sides by 24*20=480 to eliminate denominators:\n\n24a\u00b2 - 20b\u00b2 = 480.\n\nSo, 24a\u00b2 - 20b\u00b2 = 480.\n\nSimilarly, equation 2: 24c\u00b2 - 20d\u00b2 = 480.\n\nSo, now, from equation 3: ac + bd = 0. Let me express d as d = (-ac)/b.\n\nSo, substitute d into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2: 24c\u00b2 - 20d\u00b2 = 480.\n\nSubstitute d = (-ac)/b:\n\n24c\u00b2 - 20*(a\u00b2c\u00b2)/(b\u00b2) = 480.\n\nLet me factor out c\u00b2:\n\nc\u00b2 [24 - (20a\u00b2)/(b\u00b2)] = 480.\n\nFrom equation 1, we have 24a\u00b2 - 20b\u00b2 = 480.\n\nLet me solve equation 1 for 24a\u00b2:\n\n24a\u00b2 = 480 + 20b\u00b2.\n\nSo, 24a\u00b2 = 20b\u00b2 + 480.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = (20b\u00b2 + 480)/24 = (5b\u00b2 + 120)/6.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = (5b\u00b2 + 120)/6.\n\nSo, plugging this into the expression for equation 2:\n\nc\u00b2 [24 - (20a\u00b2)/(b\u00b2)] = 480.\n\nCompute (20a\u00b2)/(b\u00b2):\n\n20a\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 20*(5b\u00b2 + 120)/(6b\u00b2) = (100b\u00b2 + 2400)/(6b\u00b2) = (100b\u00b2)/(6b\u00b2) + 2400/(6b\u00b2) = 100/6 + 400/b\u00b2.\n\nSimplify: 50/3 + 400/b\u00b2.\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes:\n\nc\u00b2 [24 - (50/3 + 400/b\u00b2)] = 480.\n\nCompute 24 - 50/3: 24 is 72/3, so 72/3 - 50/3 = 22/3.\n\nSo, inside the brackets: 22/3 - 400/b\u00b2.\n\nThus:\n\nc\u00b2 (22/3 - 400/b\u00b2) = 480.\n\nSo,\n\nc\u00b2 = 480 / (22/3 - 400/b\u00b2) = 480 / [ (22b\u00b2 - 1200)/(3b\u00b2) ) ] = 480 * (3b\u00b2)/(22b\u00b2 - 1200) = (1440 b\u00b2)/(22b\u00b2 - 1200).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n(720 b\u00b2)/(11b\u00b2 - 600).\n\nSo, c\u00b2 = (720 b\u00b2)/(11b\u00b2 - 600).\n\nNow, since c\u00b2 must be positive, the denominator must be positive because the numerator is positive (b\u00b2 is positive, 720 is positive). So,\n\n11b\u00b2 - 600 > 0 \u2192 11b\u00b2 > 600 \u2192 b\u00b2 > 600/11 \u2248 54.545.\n\nSo, b\u00b2 must be greater than approximately 54.545.\n\nSo, that's a constraint.\n\nNow, remember that BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nWe have expressions for c\u00b2 and d\u00b2 in terms of b\u00b2.\n\nFrom equation 3, d = (-ac)/b. So, d\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 c\u00b2)/b\u00b2.\n\nFrom equation 1, a\u00b2 = (5b\u00b2 + 120)/6.\n\nSo, d\u00b2 = [ (5b\u00b2 + 120)/6 * c\u00b2 ] / b\u00b2 = [ (5b\u00b2 + 120) c\u00b2 ] / (6b\u00b2 ).\n\nWe have c\u00b2 expressed in terms of b\u00b2: c\u00b2 = (720 b\u00b2)/(11b\u00b2 - 600).\n\nSo, plug that into d\u00b2:\n\nd\u00b2 = [ (5b\u00b2 + 120) * (720 b\u00b2) / (11b\u00b2 - 600) ] / (6b\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nd\u00b2 = [ (5b\u00b2 + 120) * 720 b\u00b2 ] / [6b\u00b2 (11b\u00b2 - 600) ]\n\nCancel 6b\u00b2 from numerator and denominator:\n\nd\u00b2 = [ (5b\u00b2 + 120) * 120 ] / (11b\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n5b\u00b2 + 120 = 5(b\u00b2 + 24)\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2 = [5(b\u00b2 + 24) * 120 ] / (11b\u00b2 - 600 ) = [600(b\u00b2 + 24)] / (11b\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nSo, now, BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) = 4[ (720 b\u00b2)/(11b\u00b2 - 600) + 600(b\u00b2 +24)/(11b\u00b2 -600) ]\n\nCombine the terms:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 [ (720 b\u00b2 + 600b\u00b2 + 14400 ) / (11b\u00b2 -600) ]\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n720b\u00b2 +600b\u00b2 = 1320b\u00b2, plus 14400.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 [ (1320b\u00b2 +14400 ) / (11b\u00b2 -600) ]\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n1320b\u00b2 +14400 = 120(11b\u00b2 + 120)\n\nDenominator: 11b\u00b2 -600.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * [120(11b\u00b2 +120)] / (11b\u00b2 -600 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480 * (11b\u00b2 +120) / (11b\u00b2 -600 )\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480 * [ (11b\u00b2 + 120) / (11b\u00b2 - 600) ]\n\nLet me set t = 11b\u00b2. Since b\u00b2 > 600/11 \u224854.545, t > 600.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 becomes:\n\n480 * (t + 120) / (t - 600 )\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n480 * [ (t - 600 + 720) / (t - 600) ) ] = 480 * [ 1 + 720/(t - 600) ]\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480 + 480 * 720 / (t - 600 )\n\nSimplify 480*720: 480*700=336000, 480*20=9600, so total 345600.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480 + 345600 / (t - 600 )\n\nWe need to find the minimum of BD\u00b2 as t varies over t >600.\n\nSo, as t increases beyond 600, t-600 increases, so 345600/(t -600) decreases, approaching zero as t approaches infinity. So, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as t becomes very large.\n\nBut when t approaches 600 from above, t-600 approaches zero, so 345600/(t-600) becomes very large, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 480, approached as t approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but can t approach infinity? Let's see.\n\nt =11b\u00b2, so as b\u00b2 approaches infinity, t approaches infinity.\n\nBut in reality, can b\u00b2 be any large number? Let's see.\n\nFrom equation 1: a\u00b2 = (5b\u00b2 + 120)/6.\n\nSo, as b\u00b2 becomes large, a\u00b2 becomes approximately (5/6) b\u00b2, so a also becomes large.\n\nBut in the hyperbola equation, points can go to infinity, so it's possible for b\u00b2 to become arbitrarily large, hence t can approach infinity.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as desired, but never actually reaches 480 because t is approaching infinity, which is not attainable. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut wait, let me verify that. Because when t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. So, 480 is the infimum.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the infimum is 480, which is the greatest lower bound. Therefore, 480 is the greatest number such that BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480. So, any number less than 480 is also less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, but 480 is the greatest such number.\n\nWait, but in reality, can BD\u00b2 ever be less than 480? From the expression BD\u00b2 = 480 + 345600/(t - 600), since t >600, 345600/(t -600) is positive, so BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480. So, 480 is the infimum, and BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as desired but never actually reaches 480.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480. Because for any \u03b5 >0, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than 480 + \u03b5, but BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480. So, 480 is the infimum.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, 480 is the infimum, but is it attainable? No, because as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. So, for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is greater than 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but 480 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480. So, 480 is the greatest lower bound. So, the answer is 480.\n\nBut let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the algebra.\n\nWe had BD\u00b2 expressed in terms of t as 480 + 345600/(t -600). So, as t increases, the second term decreases, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, and can be made arbitrarily close to 480. So, the infimum is 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{480}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, basically, I have to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, the lower bound for BD squared, but expressed as the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all possible such rhombuses.\n\nFirst, let's recall some properties of hyperbolas and rhombuses. The hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 is centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis length is 2\u221a20, which is about 8.94, and the conjugate axis is 2\u221a24, about 9.798. The asymptotes are y = \u00b1(\u221a24/\u221a20)x, which simplifies to y = \u00b1(\u221a(6/5))x, so approximately \u00b11.095x.\n\nA rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. But wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, no, wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's right. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the diagonals AC and BD of the rhombus intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola.\n\nLet me denote the points A, B, C, D as points on the hyperbola. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and since ABCD is a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. Therefore, if I let point A be (a, b), then point C would be (-a, -b), because the diagonal AC is bisected at the origin. Similarly, points B and D would be (c, d) and (-c, -d), respectively.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are not only bisected but also perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular. So, the vectors (A - C) and (B - D) should be perpendicular. But since A, C are (-a, -b) and (a, b), the vector AC is (2a, 2b). Similarly, BD is (2c, 2d). So, the dot product of AC and BD should be zero because they are perpendicular. Therefore, (2a)(2c) + (2b)(2d) = 0. Simplifying, 4(ac + bd) = 0, so ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, that's one condition: ac + bd = 0.\n\nNow, since all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, each of them must satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nSo, for point A: (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, for point B: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nAnd since C is (-a, -b), it also satisfies the same equation as A, and same for D.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the lengths AB, BC, CD, DA are equal.\n\nLet me express AB and BC in terms of coordinates.\n\nPoint A: (a, b)\n\nPoint B: (c, d)\n\nPoint C: (-a, -b)\n\nPoint D: (-c, -d)\n\nSo, the vector AB is (c - a, d - b), and the length squared is (c - a)\u00b2 + (d - b)\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, the vector BC is (-a - c, -b - d), so the length squared is (-a - c)\u00b2 + (-b - d)\u00b2 = (a + c)\u00b2 + (b + d)\u00b2.\n\nSince AB = BC, their squares are equal:\n\n(c - a)\u00b2 + (d - b)\u00b2 = (a + c)\u00b2 + (b + d)\u00b2.\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: c\u00b2 - 2ac + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - 2bd + b\u00b2\n\nRight side: a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2\n\nSet left equal to right:\n\nc\u00b2 - 2ac + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - 2bd + b\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2\n\nSimplify both sides by subtracting a\u00b2, c\u00b2, d\u00b2, b\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n-2ac - 2bd = 2ac + 2bd\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-2ac -2bd -2ac -2bd = 0\n\nWait, no. Let me rearrange:\n\n-2ac -2bd = 2ac + 2bd\n\nBring everything to the left:\n\n-2ac -2bd -2ac -2bd = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-4ac) + (-4bd) = 0\n\nSo, -4(ac + bd) = 0.\n\nBut earlier, we found that ac + bd = 0 from the perpendicular diagonals. So, this is consistent. So, that condition is already satisfied because of the perpendicular diagonals.\n\nHmm, so that condition doesn't give us new information. So, perhaps another pair of sides can give us more information.\n\nLet me check the length of AD. Point A is (a, b), point D is (-c, -d). So, vector AD is (-c - a, -d - b). The length squared is ( -c - a )\u00b2 + ( -d - b )\u00b2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2.\n\nWait, but that's the same as BC. So, in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so AB=BC=CD=DA. So, if AB squared is equal to BC squared, which we already saw, and they equal CD squared and DA squared as well.\n\nBut perhaps I need to use another pair of sides. Let me check AB and AD.\n\nWait, AB squared is (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2.\n\nAD squared is ( -c - a )^2 + ( -d - b )^2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2.\n\nSet them equal:\n\n(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft: c\u00b2 - 2ac + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - 2bd + b\u00b2\n\nRight: a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2\n\nSet equal:\n\nc\u00b2 - 2ac + a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - 2bd + b\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2\n\nAgain, subtracting common terms:\n\n-2ac -2bd = 2ac + 2bd\n\nWhich again leads to -4ac -4bd = 0, which is the same as ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, again, same condition. So, perhaps this isn't giving me any new information.\n\nSo, maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nSince all four points lie on the hyperbola, perhaps I can parameterize them.\n\nWait, hyperbola parametrization: for hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, a parametrization can be (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), but that's for one branch. Alternatively, since points can be on either branch, maybe it's better to use hyperbola coordinates.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to note that the diagonals of the rhombus are along certain lines, and the points are symmetric about the origin.\n\nWait, let's think about the coordinates.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, so points A and C are symmetric about the origin, as are B and D.\n\nSo, if A is (a, b), then C is (-a, -b). Similarly, B is (c, d), and D is (-c, -d).\n\nNow, the diagonals are AC and BD.\n\nSo, the diagonals are AC: from (a, b) to (-a, -b), which is the line y = (b/a)x if a \u2260 0. Similarly, BD is from (c, d) to (-c, -d), which is the line y = (d/c)x if c \u2260 0.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nSo, (b/a) * (d/c) = -1.\n\nSo, (bd)/(ac) = -1.\n\nBut earlier, we found that ac + bd = 0, which is the same as bd = -ac.\n\nSo, (bd)/(ac) = (-ac)/ac = -1. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the condition is bd = -ac.\n\nSo, now, moving forward.\n\nEach of the points A, B, C, D must lie on the hyperbola, so:\n\nFor A: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nFor B: c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nAlso, since BD is the diagonal from B to D, which is from (c, d) to (-c, -d). So, the length BD is the distance between these two points, which is sqrt[(c - (-c))\u00b2 + (d - (-d))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2c)^2 + (2d)^2] = 2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD squared is [2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2)]\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nOur goal is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of the lower bounds of BD\u00b2. That is, the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombuses is the greatest lower bound. So, the greatest number that is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. But the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2\", so perhaps it's the supremum of all numbers m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. So, if the infimum of BD\u00b2 is m, then m is the greatest lower bound, and any number less than m would also be a lower bound. But since the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi,\" perhaps it's the infimum.\n\nWait, but actually, if the infimum is m, then m is the greatest lower bound, so any number less than m would not be a lower bound. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, if m is the infimum, then for any \u03b5 > 0, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than m + \u03b5. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would be the infimum. Because if you take any number greater than the infimum, say m', then m' > m, but there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than m', so m' can't be a lower bound for all BD\u00b2. Hence, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is the infimum.\n\nSo, I think the problem is asking for the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is the greatest lower bound.\n\nSo, I need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, which is 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), given the constraints that points A(a, b) and B(c, d) lie on the hyperbola, and that ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, let me restate the problem in terms of optimization.\n\nWe need to minimize BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), subject to:\n\n1. a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1\n2. c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1\n3. ac + bd = 0\n\nSo, we have four variables: a, b, c, d. But they are related by the three equations above.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express some variables in terms of others.\n\nFrom equation 3: ac + bd = 0. Let me solve for one variable in terms of others, say, d.\n\nFrom equation 3: d = (-ac)/b.\n\nBut from equation 1: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1. Let me express b\u00b2 in terms of a\u00b2.\n\nFrom equation 1: b\u00b2 = (24/20)a\u00b2 - 24 = (6/5)a\u00b2 - 24.\n\nWait, let me do that again. Equation 1: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1. Multiply both sides by 24*20=480 to eliminate denominators:\n\n24a\u00b2 - 20b\u00b2 = 480.\n\nSo, 24a\u00b2 - 20b\u00b2 = 480.\n\nSimilarly, equation 2: 24c\u00b2 - 20d\u00b2 = 480.\n\nSo, now, from equation 3: ac + bd = 0. Let me express d as d = (-ac)/b.\n\nSo, substitute d into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2: 24c\u00b2 - 20d\u00b2 = 480.\n\nSubstitute d = (-ac)/b:\n\n24c\u00b2 - 20*(a\u00b2c\u00b2)/(b\u00b2) = 480.\n\nLet me factor out c\u00b2:\n\nc\u00b2 [24 - (20a\u00b2)/(b\u00b2)] = 480.\n\nFrom equation 1, we have 24a\u00b2 - 20b\u00b2 = 480.\n\nLet me solve equation 1 for 24a\u00b2:\n\n24a\u00b2 = 480 + 20b\u00b2.\n\nSo, 24a\u00b2 = 20b\u00b2 + 480.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = (20b\u00b2 + 480)/24 = (5b\u00b2 + 120)/6.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = (5b\u00b2 + 120)/6.\n\nSo, plugging this into the expression for equation 2:\n\nc\u00b2 [24 - (20a\u00b2)/(b\u00b2)] = 480.\n\nCompute (20a\u00b2)/(b\u00b2):\n\n20a\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 20*(5b\u00b2 + 120)/(6b\u00b2) = (100b\u00b2 + 2400)/(6b\u00b2) = (100b\u00b2)/(6b\u00b2) + 2400/(6b\u00b2) = 100/6 + 400/b\u00b2.\n\nSimplify: 50/3 + 400/b\u00b2.\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes:\n\nc\u00b2 [24 - (50/3 + 400/b\u00b2)] = 480.\n\nCompute 24 - 50/3: 24 is 72/3, so 72/3 - 50/3 = 22/3.\n\nSo, inside the brackets: 22/3 - 400/b\u00b2.\n\nThus:\n\nc\u00b2 (22/3 - 400/b\u00b2) = 480.\n\nSo,\n\nc\u00b2 = 480 / (22/3 - 400/b\u00b2) = 480 / [ (22b\u00b2 - 1200)/(3b\u00b2) ) ] = 480 * (3b\u00b2)/(22b\u00b2 - 1200) = (1440 b\u00b2)/(22b\u00b2 - 1200).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n(720 b\u00b2)/(11b\u00b2 - 600).\n\nSo, c\u00b2 = (720 b\u00b2)/(11b\u00b2 - 600).\n\nNow, since c\u00b2 must be positive, the denominator must be positive because the numerator is positive (b\u00b2 is positive, 720 is positive). So,\n\n11b\u00b2 - 600 > 0 \u2192 11b\u00b2 > 600 \u2192 b\u00b2 > 600/11 \u2248 54.545.\n\nSo, b\u00b2 must be greater than approximately 54.545.\n\nSo, that's a constraint.\n\nNow, remember that BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nWe have expressions for c\u00b2 and d\u00b2 in terms of b\u00b2.\n\nFrom equation 3, d = (-ac)/b. So, d\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 c\u00b2)/b\u00b2.\n\nFrom equation 1, a\u00b2 = (5b\u00b2 + 120)/6.\n\nSo, d\u00b2 = [ (5b\u00b2 + 120)/6 * c\u00b2 ] / b\u00b2 = [ (5b\u00b2 + 120) c\u00b2 ] / (6b\u00b2 ).\n\nWe have c\u00b2 expressed in terms of b\u00b2: c\u00b2 = (720 b\u00b2)/(11b\u00b2 - 600).\n\nSo, plug that into d\u00b2:\n\nd\u00b2 = [ (5b\u00b2 + 120) * (720 b\u00b2) / (11b\u00b2 - 600) ] / (6b\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nd\u00b2 = [ (5b\u00b2 + 120) * 720 b\u00b2 ] / [6b\u00b2 (11b\u00b2 - 600) ]\n\nCancel 6b\u00b2 from numerator and denominator:\n\nd\u00b2 = [ (5b\u00b2 + 120) * 120 ] / (11b\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n5b\u00b2 + 120 = 5(b\u00b2 + 24)\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2 = [5(b\u00b2 + 24) * 120 ] / (11b\u00b2 - 600 ) = [600(b\u00b2 + 24)] / (11b\u00b2 - 600 )\n\nSo, now, BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) = 4[ (720 b\u00b2)/(11b\u00b2 - 600) + 600(b\u00b2 +24)/(11b\u00b2 -600) ]\n\nCombine the terms:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 [ (720 b\u00b2 + 600b\u00b2 + 14400 ) / (11b\u00b2 -600) ]\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n720b\u00b2 +600b\u00b2 = 1320b\u00b2, plus 14400.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 [ (1320b\u00b2 +14400 ) / (11b\u00b2 -600) ]\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n1320b\u00b2 +14400 = 120(11b\u00b2 + 120)\n\nDenominator: 11b\u00b2 -600.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * [120(11b\u00b2 +120)] / (11b\u00b2 -600 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480 * (11b\u00b2 +120) / (11b\u00b2 -600 )\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480 * [ (11b\u00b2 + 120) / (11b\u00b2 - 600) ]\n\nLet me set t = 11b\u00b2. Since b\u00b2 > 600/11 \u224854.545, t > 600.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 becomes:\n\n480 * (t + 120) / (t - 600 )\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n480 * [ (t - 600 + 720) / (t - 600) ) ] = 480 * [ 1 + 720/(t - 600) ]\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480 + 480 * 720 / (t - 600 )\n\nSimplify 480*720: 480*700=336000, 480*20=9600, so total 345600.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480 + 345600 / (t - 600 )\n\nWe need to find the minimum of BD\u00b2 as t varies over t >600.\n\nSo, as t increases beyond 600, t-600 increases, so 345600/(t -600) decreases, approaching zero as t approaches infinity. So, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as t becomes very large.\n\nBut when t approaches 600 from above, t-600 approaches zero, so 345600/(t-600) becomes very large, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 480, approached as t approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but can t approach infinity? Let's see.\n\nt =11b\u00b2, so as b\u00b2 approaches infinity, t approaches infinity.\n\nBut in reality, can b\u00b2 be any large number? Let's see.\n\nFrom equation 1: a\u00b2 = (5b\u00b2 + 120)/6.\n\nSo, as b\u00b2 becomes large, a\u00b2 becomes approximately (5/6) b\u00b2, so a also becomes large.\n\nBut in the hyperbola equation, points can go to infinity, so it's possible for b\u00b2 to become arbitrarily large, hence t can approach infinity.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as desired, but never actually reaches 480 because t is approaching infinity, which is not attainable. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut wait, let me verify that. Because when t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. So, 480 is the infimum.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the infimum is 480, which is the greatest lower bound. Therefore, 480 is the greatest number such that BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480. So, any number less than 480 is also less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, but 480 is the greatest such number.\n\nWait, but in reality, can BD\u00b2 ever be less than 480? From the expression BD\u00b2 = 480 + 345600/(t - 600), since t >600, 345600/(t -600) is positive, so BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480. So, 480 is the infimum, and BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as desired but never actually reaches 480.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480. Because for any \u03b5 >0, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than 480 + \u03b5, but BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480. So, 480 is the infimum.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, 480 is the infimum, but is it attainable? No, because as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. So, for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is greater than 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but 480 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480. So, 480 is the greatest lower bound. So, the answer is 480.\n\nBut let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the algebra.\n\nWe had BD\u00b2 expressed in terms of t as 480 + 345600/(t -600). So, as t increases, the second term decreases, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, and can be made arbitrarily close to 480. So, the infimum is 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{480}\n\n\nGiven the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\), we need to find the greatest real number that is less than \\(BD^2\\) for all rhombuses \\(ABCD\\) whose diagonals intersect at the origin.\n\n1. **Hyperbola and Rhombus Properties**:\n   - The hyperbola is centered at the origin.\n   - The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.\n   - Points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) lie on the hyperbola, with \\(A = (a, b)\\), \\(C = (-a, -b)\\), \\(B = (c, d)\\), and \\(D = (-c, -d)\\).\n\n2. **Conditions**:\n   - The diagonals are perpendicular, leading to the condition \\(ac + bd = 0\\).\n   - Each point satisfies the hyperbola equation: \\(\\frac{a^2}{20} - \\frac{b^2}{24} = 1\\) and \\(\\frac{c^2}{20} - \\frac{d^2}{24} = 1\\).\n\n3. **BD Length Calculation**:\n   - The length of diagonal \\(BD\\) is \\(2\\sqrt{c^2 + d^2}\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(BD^2 = 4(c^2 + d^2)\\).\n\n4. **Optimization**:\n   - Using the conditions and hyperbola equations, we express \\(c^2\\) and \\(d^2\\) in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n   - After substituting and simplifying, we find that \\(BD^2\\) can be expressed as \\(480 + \\frac{345600}{t - 600}\\) where \\(t = 11b^2\\).\n\n5. **Infimum Calculation**:\n   - As \\(t\\) approaches infinity, \\(BD^2\\) approaches 480.\n   - Therefore, the infimum of \\(BD^2\\) is 480, meaning \\(BD^2\\) is always greater than 480.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is \\(\\boxed{480}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to break it down and figure it out step by step.\n\nThe hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right because the positive term is with x\u00b2. The standard form is x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, so here a\u00b2 is 20 and b\u00b2 is 24. Therefore, a is sqrt(20) which is 2*sqrt(5), and b is sqrt(24) which is 2*sqrt(6).\n\nNow, the problem mentions points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, but wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me check that.\n\nYes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, they intersect at 90 degrees. Okay, so that's a key property. So, in this case, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.\n\nSo, since the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals, the coordinates of the points must be such that for points A and C, which are endpoints of one diagonal, their coordinates average to the origin. Similarly, for points B and D, the other diagonal, their coordinates also average to the origin.\n\nSo, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D must be (-p, -q).\n\nBut all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola. So, plugging these into the hyperbola equation, we have:\n\nFor point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\nFor point B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nBut since C is (-x, -y) and D is (-p, -q), they will automatically satisfy the hyperbola equation as well because squaring removes the sign.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, since the sides are equal and the diagonals are perpendicular, we can use the properties of a rhombus in terms of its diagonals. In a rhombus, the area can be expressed as (d1*d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. Also, each side can be expressed in terms of the diagonals: if the diagonals are d1 and d2, then each side is sqrt[(d1/2)\u00b2 + (d2/2)\u00b2] = (1/2)sqrt(d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2).\n\nBut maybe it's better to approach this using coordinates and vectors.\n\nLet me consider the coordinates of the points. Let's denote points A, B, C, D as follows:\n\nA = (x, y)\nC = (-x, -y)\nB = (p, q)\nD = (-p, -q)\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, the vectors AB and AD should have the same magnitude, and the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are all equal.\n\nAlternatively, considering the diagonals, AC and BD. The diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.\n\nVector AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y). Vector BD is from B to D, which is (-2p, -2q). But actually, since AC is from (x,y) to (-x,-y), the vector is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from (p,q) to (-p,-q), so vector is (-2p, -2q).\n\nWait, but actually, the diagonals are AC and BD, so vectors along the diagonals are AC = (-2x, -2y) and BD = (-2p, -2q). Since they are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0\nWhich simplifies to 4xp + 4yq = 0\nDivide both sides by 4: xp + yq = 0\n\nSo, equation (1): xp + yq = 0.\n\nNow, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, we have:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSo, equations (2) and (3): both points A and B lie on the hyperbola.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C, etc. Let's compute the distance AB.\n\nPoint A: (x, y)\nPoint B: (p, q)\nDistance AB: sqrt[(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2]\n\nSimilarly, the distance BC: sqrt[(-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2] = sqrt[(-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2] = same as sqrt[(x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2]\n\nSince AB = BC, their squares must be equal:\n\n(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft: p\u00b2 - 2xp + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2yq + y\u00b2\nRight: x\u00b2 + 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yq + q\u00b2\n\nSubtract left from right:\n\n( x\u00b2 + 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yq + q\u00b2 ) - ( p\u00b2 - 2xp + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2yq + y\u00b2 ) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yq + q\u00b2 - p\u00b2 + 2xp - x\u00b2 - q\u00b2 + 2yq - y\u00b2 = 0\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to subtract the left side from the right side:\n\nRight - Left = [x\u00b2 + 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yq + q\u00b2] - [p\u00b2 - 2xp + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2yq + y\u00b2] = 0\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nx\u00b2 cancels with -x\u00b2\np\u00b2 cancels with -p\u00b2\ny\u00b2 cancels with -y\u00b2\nq\u00b2 cancels with -q\u00b2\n\nWhat remains is 2xp + 2yq - (-2xp -2yq) ?\n\nWait, let's do it step by step.\n\nRight: x\u00b2 + 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yq + q\u00b2\nLeft: p\u00b2 - 2xp + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2yq + y\u00b2\n\nSubtract left from right:\n\n(x\u00b2 + 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yq + q\u00b2) - (p\u00b2 - 2xp + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2yq + y\u00b2) \n\n= x\u00b2 - x\u00b2 + 2xp - (-2xp) + p\u00b2 - p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - y\u00b2 + 2yq - (-2yq) + q\u00b2 - q\u00b2\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nx\u00b2 - x\u00b2 = 0\n2xp - (-2xp) = 4xp\np\u00b2 - p\u00b2 = 0\ny\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 0\n2yq - (-2yq) = 4yq\nq\u00b2 - q\u00b2 = 0\n\nSo, total is 4xp + 4yq = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to xp + yq = 0\n\nWait, that's the same as equation (1) we had earlier. So, the condition that AB = BC leads us back to xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, that doesn't give us any new information. Hmm, so perhaps I need to find another condition.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, the sides are equal, but perhaps I should consider the vectors AB and AD.\n\nVector AB is (p - x, q - y)\nVector AD is (-p - x, -q - y)\n\nIn a rhombus, adjacent sides are vectors that have the same magnitude but different directions. However, another property is that the adjacent sides are perpendicular in a square, but in a rhombus, they are not necessarily perpendicular.\n\nWait, no. In a rhombus, the sides are not necessarily perpendicular. So, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, and we know their vectors, maybe we can relate the slopes.\n\nWait, the diagonals are AC and BD, with vectors AC = (-2x, -2y) and BD = (-2p, -2q). Since they are perpendicular, their dot product is zero, so:\n\n(-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0 => 4xp + 4yq = 0 => xp + yq = 0.\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to use the fact that all four points lie on the hyperbola, and the conditions xp + yq = 0, and the hyperbola equations.\n\nSo, let's write down the equations we have:\n\n1. xp + yq = 0\n2. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n3. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2. BD is the length of diagonal BD. Since BD is from point B to D, which is from (p, q) to (-p, -q). So, the length is sqrt[(-p - p)^2 + (-q - q)^2] = sqrt[(-2p)^2 + (-2q)^2] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 is [2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)]\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nOur goal is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, we need to find the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2. Because the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the minimal possible value of BD\u00b2, but the question is phrased a bit differently.\n\nWait, no. If we're looking for the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because the infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to some minimum value, that minimum is the infimum, and the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be that infimum.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2, which is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), given the constraints.\n\nSo, our task reduces to minimizing 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) subject to the constraints:\n\n1. xp + yq = 0\n2. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n3. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nHmm, that's a system of equations. So, let's see how we can approach this.\n\nWe can consider that points A and B lie on the hyperbola, with coordinates (x,y) and (p,q) respectively, satisfying the hyperbola equations and the condition xp + yq = 0.\n\nWe can try to express variables in terms of each other.\n\nFrom equation (1): xp + yq = 0 => yq = -xp => q = (-xp)/y, provided y \u2260 0.\n\nSimilarly, from hyperbola equation for point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, for point B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, substituting q = (-xp)/y into the hyperbola equation for point B:\n\np\u00b2/20 - [(-xp)/y]^2 /24 = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\np\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2p\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) = 1\n\nFactor out p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2)] = 1\n\nHmm, let's write this as:\n\np\u00b2 [ (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2) / (20 * 24 y\u00b2) ) ] = 1\n\nWait, let's compute the coefficient:\n\n1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) = (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2) / (20 * 24 y\u00b2)\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\np\u00b2 * (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2) / (480 y\u00b2) ) = 1\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 480 y\u00b2 / (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2)\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nFactor numerator: 480 y\u00b2\nDenominator: 24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2 = 4*(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = (480 y\u00b2) / [4*(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)] = (120 y\u00b2) / (6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = (120 y\u00b2) / (6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)\n\nSimilarly, from the hyperbola equation for point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nLet me write that as:\n\nMultiply both sides by 24*20 = 480:\n\n24 x\u00b2 - 20 y\u00b2 = 480\n\nSo, 24x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 = 480\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n6x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2 = 120 (divided both sides by 4)\n\nSo, 6x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2 = 120\n\nWait, let me note that.\n\nSo, 6x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2 = 120.\n\nNow, let's go back to p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 = (120 y\u00b2) / (6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)\n\nBut note that the denominator is 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2. From the hyperbola equation, 6x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2 = 120, so 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 = ?\n\nLet me compute 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2.\n\nFrom 6x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2 = 120, I can express 6x\u00b2 = 5 y\u00b2 + 120.\n\nSo, 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 = 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2. Hmm, let's express it in terms of known quantities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 = - (5 x\u00b2 -6 y\u00b2) = - ( (5 x\u00b2 -6 y\u00b2) )\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me express 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2.\n\nFrom the hyperbola equation, 6x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2 = 120, so 6x\u00b2 = 5 y\u00b2 + 120.\n\nThus, 6 y\u00b2 = (5 y\u00b2 + 120)* (6 y\u00b2 /6x\u00b2). Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me write 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 as follows:\n\nFrom 6x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2 = 120,\n\nLet me compute 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2:\n\n= 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2\n= -(5x\u00b2 -6 y\u00b2)\n= -(5x\u00b2 -6 y\u00b2)\n\nBut from the hyperbola equation, 5x\u00b2 -6 y\u00b2 = -120.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom 6x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2 = 120,\n\nMultiply both sides by -1: -6x\u00b2 +5 y\u00b2 = -120\n\nWhich is 5 y\u00b2 -6 x\u00b2 = -120\n\nSo, 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 = ?\n\nWait, no, 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 is not directly related. Let me compute 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can express it in terms of the hyperbola equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a relationship between p and y.\n\nWait, let's take a step back.\n\nWe have:\n\nFrom equation (1): xp + yq = 0, so q = (-xp)/y\n\nFrom the hyperbola equation for point B:\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSubstituting q:\n\np\u00b2/20 - [ (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(y\u00b2) ] /24 = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) ] = 1\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\np\u00b2 = 1 / [1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2)]\n\nLet me write that as:\n\np\u00b2 = 1 / [ (24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2) / (20 *24 y\u00b2) ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\np\u00b2 = (20 *24 y\u00b2) / (24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2) = (480 y\u00b2) / (24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2)\n\nWhich is what we had before.\n\nBut from the hyperbola equation for point A:\n\n24x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 = 480\n\nSo, 24x\u00b2 = 20 y\u00b2 +480\n\nSo, 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 = 24 y\u00b2 - (20 y\u00b2 +480)/ (24/20) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I can express 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 in terms of the hyperbola equation.\n\nFrom 24x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 =480, so 24x\u00b2 =20 y\u00b2 +480.\n\nSo, 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 =24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps express it as:\n\n24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 =24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 = ?\n\nWe can factor 4:\n\n=4*(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)\n\nHmm, but from the hyperbola equation, 6x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2 =120, which can be written as:\n\n6x\u00b2 =5 y\u00b2 +120.\n\nSo, 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 =6 y\u00b2 -5*( (5 y\u00b2 +120)/6 )\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nFrom 6x\u00b2 =5 y\u00b2 +120,\n\nx\u00b2 = (5 y\u00b2 +120)/6\n\nSo, 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 =6 y\u00b2 -5*(5 y\u00b2 +120)/6\n\nCompute this:\n\n=6 y\u00b2 - (25 y\u00b2 + 600)/6\n\nConvert 6 y\u00b2 to 36 y\u00b2 /6:\n\n= (36 y\u00b2 -25 y\u00b2 -600)/6\n\n= (11 y\u00b2 -600)/6\n\nSo, 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 = (11 y\u00b2 -600)/6\n\nTherefore, 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 =4*(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2) =4*(11 y\u00b2 -600)/6 = (44 y\u00b2 -2400)/6 = (22 y\u00b2 -1200)/3\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = (480 y\u00b2) / (24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2) = (480 y\u00b2) / [ (22 y\u00b2 -1200)/3 ) ]\n\nWhich is:\n\np\u00b2 = (480 y\u00b2) * (3)/(22 y\u00b2 -1200) ) = (1440 y\u00b2)/(22 y\u00b2 -1200)\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = (1440 y\u00b2)/(22 y\u00b2 -1200)\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nFactor numerator: 1440 y\u00b2 = 1440 y\u00b2\n\nDenominator: 22 y\u00b2 -1200 = 22(y\u00b2 - 1200/22) = 22(y\u00b2 - 54.545...)\n\nBut perhaps we can factor 2 from denominator:\n\n22 y\u00b2 -1200 = 2*(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = (1440 y\u00b2) / [2*(11 y\u00b2 -600)] ) = (720 y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = (720 y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nNow, our goal is to compute BD\u00b2 =4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)\n\nBut we have q in terms of p and x and y: q = (-xp)/y\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/y\u00b2\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4(p\u00b2 + (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/y\u00b2 )=4 p\u00b2 (1 + x\u00b2 / y\u00b2 )\n\n=4 p\u00b2 ( (y\u00b2 +x\u00b2)/y\u00b2 )\n\nBut from hyperbola equation for point A:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1\n\nMultiply both sides by 20*24=480:\n\n24x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 =480\n\nSo, 24x\u00b2 =20 y\u00b2 +480\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = (20 y\u00b2 +480)/24 = (5 y\u00b2 +120)/6\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = (5 y\u00b2 +120)/6\n\nTherefore, x\u00b2/y\u00b2 = (5 y\u00b2 +120)/(6 y\u00b2 )= (5 + 120/y\u00b2)/6\n\nHmm, perhaps plug that into BD\u00b2.\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 p\u00b2 ( (y\u00b2 +x\u00b2)/y\u00b2 ) =4 p\u00b2 [1 + x\u00b2/y\u00b2 ]\n\nWe have x\u00b2/y\u00b2 = (5 y\u00b2 +120)/(6 y\u00b2 ) =5/(6) + 120/(6 y\u00b2 )=5/6 +20/y\u00b2\n\nSo, 1 + x\u00b2/y\u00b2 =1 +5/6 +20/y\u00b2=11/6 +20/y\u00b2\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2=4 p\u00b2 (11/6 +20/y\u00b2 )\n\nBut p\u00b2 is (720 y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4 * [ (720 y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 -600) ] * [11/6 +20/y\u00b2 ]\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, compute 4 *720 y\u00b2= 2880 y\u00b2\n\nThen, denominator is (11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nAnd the bracket term is 11/6 +20/y\u00b2\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= [2880 y\u00b2 / (11 y\u00b2 -600) ] * [11/6 +20/y\u00b2 ]\n\nLet me compute the second bracket term:\n\n11/6 +20/y\u00b2 = (11 y\u00b2 + 120)/ (6 y\u00b2 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= [2880 y\u00b2 / (11 y\u00b2 -600) ] * [ (11 y\u00b2 +120 )/(6 y\u00b2 ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n2880 y\u00b2 * (11 y\u00b2 +120 ) / [ (11 y\u00b2 -600 ) *6 y\u00b2 ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n2880 /6 =480\n\ny\u00b2 / y\u00b2 =1\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(11 y\u00b2 +120 )/(11 y\u00b2 -600 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(11 y\u00b2 +120 )/(11 y\u00b2 -600 )\n\nHmm, that's a function of y\u00b2. Let me denote t = y\u00b2. Then,\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11 t +120 )/(11 t -600 )\n\nSo, now, we can write BD\u00b2 as a function of t:\n\nf(t) =480*(11 t +120 )/(11 t -600 )\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of f(t). Since BD\u00b2 is expressed in terms of t, which is y\u00b2, and y\u00b2 must be positive. Also, from the hyperbola equation, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1, so y\u00b2 must satisfy x\u00b2=20(1 + y\u00b2/24) \u226520, so y can be any real number, but y\u00b2 must be such that x\u00b2 is positive, which it is for all real y.\n\nBut looking at the expression for p\u00b2, which is (720 y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 -600), the denominator 11 y\u00b2 -600 must not be zero, so y\u00b2 \u2260600/11\u224854.545.\n\nAlso, since p\u00b2 must be positive, the denominator 11 y\u00b2 -600 must have the same sign as the numerator 720 y\u00b2, which is always positive. So, denominator must be positive. Therefore,\n\n11 y\u00b2 -600 >0 => y\u00b2 >600/11 \u224854.545\n\nSo, t>600/11.\n\nSo, t>54.545.\n\nSo, our function is f(t)=480*(11 t +120)/(11 t -600 ) for t>600/11.\n\nWe can write f(t) as:\n\nf(t)=480*(11 t +120 )/(11 t -600 )\n\nLet me simplify this expression:\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:11 t +120 =11 t +120\n\nDenominator:11 t -600\n\nSo, f(t)=480*(11 t +120)/(11 t -600 )\n\nLet me perform polynomial division or rewrite this fraction.\n\nLet me write:\n\n(11t +120 )/(11t -600 )= [ (11t -600 ) +720 ]/(11t -600 )=1 + 720/(11t -600 )\n\nSo, f(t)=480*[1 +720/(11t -600 ) ]\n\n=480 + 480*720/(11t -600 )\n\nSo, f(t)=480 + (480*720)/(11t -600 )\n\nBut 480*720= 480*720= 345,600.\n\nSo, f(t)=480 + 345600/(11t -600 )\n\nNow, since t>600/11\u224854.545, denominator 11t -600 is positive, so 11t -600>0.\n\nSo, 345600/(11t -600 ) is positive, so f(t) is greater than 480.\n\nBut we need to find the minimal value of f(t), which would occur when 345600/(11t -600 ) is minimized, which is when denominator is maximized.\n\nBut wait, as t increases, denominator 11t -600 increases, so 345600/(11t -600 ) decreases, approaching zero as t approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, f(t) approaches 480 as t approaches infinity.\n\nBut is 480 the minimal value? Wait, but t can't be infinity, so f(t) can get arbitrarily close to 480 from above.\n\nWait, but we need to check whether f(t) can be less than 480 or not. Wait, since denominator is positive, and the expression is 480 + positive term, so f(t) is always greater than 480.\n\nSo, the minimal value of f(t) is 480, approached as t approaches infinity. Therefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut wait, we need to confirm if BD\u00b2 can actually reach 480 or not. Since as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, but never actually reaches it because t can't be infinity.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check the computations because sometimes during algebra mistakes can happen.\n\nWait, let's recap:\n\nWe started with BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 )\n\nExpressed q in terms of p, x, y.\n\nThen, using hyperbola equations, we expressed x\u00b2 in terms of y\u00b2, then substituted into BD\u00b2, leading to BD\u00b2 expressed as a function of y\u00b2, which is t.\n\nWe found that BD\u00b2=480 +345600/(11t -600 )\n\nAs t increases, the second term approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSince BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, the infimum is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 480.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the infimum is 480, so the answer is 480.\n\nBut let me just think if there's a way BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480.\n\nIf BD\u00b2=480, then 345600/(11t -600 )=0, which implies t approaches infinity, so y\u00b2 approaches infinity, which is not possible for a finite hyperbola. So, BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480 but can't actually reach it. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nThus, the answer is 480.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{480}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to break it down and figure it out step by step.\n\nThe hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right because the positive term is with x\u00b2. The standard form is x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, so here a\u00b2 is 20 and b\u00b2 is 24. Therefore, a is sqrt(20) which is 2*sqrt(5), and b is sqrt(24) which is 2*sqrt(6).\n\nNow, the problem mentions points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, but wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me check that.\n\nYes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, they intersect at 90 degrees. Okay, so that's a key property. So, in this case, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.\n\nSo, since the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals, the coordinates of the points must be such that for points A and C, which are endpoints of one diagonal, their coordinates average to the origin. Similarly, for points B and D, the other diagonal, their coordinates also average to the origin.\n\nSo, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D must be (-p, -q).\n\nBut all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola. So, plugging these into the hyperbola equation, we have:\n\nFor point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\nFor point B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nBut since C is (-x, -y) and D is (-p, -q), they will automatically satisfy the hyperbola equation as well because squaring removes the sign.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, since the sides are equal and the diagonals are perpendicular, we can use the properties of a rhombus in terms of its diagonals. In a rhombus, the area can be expressed as (d1*d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. Also, each side can be expressed in terms of the diagonals: if the diagonals are d1 and d2, then each side is sqrt[(d1/2)\u00b2 + (d2/2)\u00b2] = (1/2)sqrt(d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2).\n\nBut maybe it's better to approach this using coordinates and vectors.\n\nLet me consider the coordinates of the points. Let's denote points A, B, C, D as follows:\n\nA = (x, y)\nC = (-x, -y)\nB = (p, q)\nD = (-p, -q)\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, the vectors AB and AD should have the same magnitude, and the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are all equal.\n\nAlternatively, considering the diagonals, AC and BD. The diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.\n\nVector AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y). Vector BD is from B to D, which is (-2p, -2q). But actually, since AC is from (x,y) to (-x,-y), the vector is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from (p,q) to (-p,-q), so vector is (-2p, -2q).\n\nWait, but actually, the diagonals are AC and BD, so vectors along the diagonals are AC = (-2x, -2y) and BD = (-2p, -2q). Since they are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0\nWhich simplifies to 4xp + 4yq = 0\nDivide both sides by 4: xp + yq = 0\n\nSo, equation (1): xp + yq = 0.\n\nNow, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, we have:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSo, equations (2) and (3): both points A and B lie on the hyperbola.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C, etc. Let's compute the distance AB.\n\nPoint A: (x, y)\nPoint B: (p, q)\nDistance AB: sqrt[(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2]\n\nSimilarly, the distance BC: sqrt[(-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2] = sqrt[(-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2] = same as sqrt[(x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2]\n\nSince AB = BC, their squares must be equal:\n\n(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft: p\u00b2 - 2xp + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2yq + y\u00b2\nRight: x\u00b2 + 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yq + q\u00b2\n\nSubtract left from right:\n\n( x\u00b2 + 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yq + q\u00b2 ) - ( p\u00b2 - 2xp + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2yq + y\u00b2 ) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yq + q\u00b2 - p\u00b2 + 2xp - x\u00b2 - q\u00b2 + 2yq - y\u00b2 = 0\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to subtract the left side from the right side:\n\nRight - Left = [x\u00b2 + 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yq + q\u00b2] - [p\u00b2 - 2xp + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2yq + y\u00b2] = 0\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nx\u00b2 cancels with -x\u00b2\np\u00b2 cancels with -p\u00b2\ny\u00b2 cancels with -y\u00b2\nq\u00b2 cancels with -q\u00b2\n\nWhat remains is 2xp + 2yq - (-2xp -2yq) ?\n\nWait, let's do it step by step.\n\nRight: x\u00b2 + 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yq + q\u00b2\nLeft: p\u00b2 - 2xp + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2yq + y\u00b2\n\nSubtract left from right:\n\n(x\u00b2 + 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yq + q\u00b2) - (p\u00b2 - 2xp + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2yq + y\u00b2) \n\n= x\u00b2 - x\u00b2 + 2xp - (-2xp) + p\u00b2 - p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - y\u00b2 + 2yq - (-2yq) + q\u00b2 - q\u00b2\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nx\u00b2 - x\u00b2 = 0\n2xp - (-2xp) = 4xp\np\u00b2 - p\u00b2 = 0\ny\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 0\n2yq - (-2yq) = 4yq\nq\u00b2 - q\u00b2 = 0\n\nSo, total is 4xp + 4yq = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to xp + yq = 0\n\nWait, that's the same as equation (1) we had earlier. So, the condition that AB = BC leads us back to xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, that doesn't give us any new information. Hmm, so perhaps I need to find another condition.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, the sides are equal, but perhaps I should consider the vectors AB and AD.\n\nVector AB is (p - x, q - y)\nVector AD is (-p - x, -q - y)\n\nIn a rhombus, adjacent sides are vectors that have the same magnitude but different directions. However, another property is that the adjacent sides are perpendicular in a square, but in a rhombus, they are not necessarily perpendicular.\n\nWait, no. In a rhombus, the sides are not necessarily perpendicular. So, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, and we know their vectors, maybe we can relate the slopes.\n\nWait, the diagonals are AC and BD, with vectors AC = (-2x, -2y) and BD = (-2p, -2q). Since they are perpendicular, their dot product is zero, so:\n\n(-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0 => 4xp + 4yq = 0 => xp + yq = 0.\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to use the fact that all four points lie on the hyperbola, and the conditions xp + yq = 0, and the hyperbola equations.\n\nSo, let's write down the equations we have:\n\n1. xp + yq = 0\n2. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n3. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2. BD is the length of diagonal BD. Since BD is from point B to D, which is from (p, q) to (-p, -q). So, the length is sqrt[(-p - p)^2 + (-q - q)^2] = sqrt[(-2p)^2 + (-2q)^2] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 is [2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)]\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nOur goal is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, we need to find the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2. Because the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the minimal possible value of BD\u00b2, but the question is phrased a bit differently.\n\nWait, no. If we're looking for the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because the infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to some minimum value, that minimum is the infimum, and the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be that infimum.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2, which is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), given the constraints.\n\nSo, our task reduces to minimizing 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) subject to the constraints:\n\n1. xp + yq = 0\n2. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n3. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nHmm, that's a system of equations. So, let's see how we can approach this.\n\nWe can consider that points A and B lie on the hyperbola, with coordinates (x,y) and (p,q) respectively, satisfying the hyperbola equations and the condition xp + yq = 0.\n\nWe can try to express variables in terms of each other.\n\nFrom equation (1): xp + yq = 0 => yq = -xp => q = (-xp)/y, provided y \u2260 0.\n\nSimilarly, from hyperbola equation for point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, for point B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, substituting q = (-xp)/y into the hyperbola equation for point B:\n\np\u00b2/20 - [(-xp)/y]^2 /24 = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\np\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2p\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) = 1\n\nFactor out p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2)] = 1\n\nHmm, let's write this as:\n\np\u00b2 [ (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2) / (20 * 24 y\u00b2) ) ] = 1\n\nWait, let's compute the coefficient:\n\n1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) = (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2) / (20 * 24 y\u00b2)\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\np\u00b2 * (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2) / (480 y\u00b2) ) = 1\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 480 y\u00b2 / (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2)\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nFactor numerator: 480 y\u00b2\nDenominator: 24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2 = 4*(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = (480 y\u00b2) / [4*(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)] = (120 y\u00b2) / (6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = (120 y\u00b2) / (6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)\n\nSimilarly, from the hyperbola equation for point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nLet me write that as:\n\nMultiply both sides by 24*20 = 480:\n\n24 x\u00b2 - 20 y\u00b2 = 480\n\nSo, 24x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 = 480\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n6x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2 = 120 (divided both sides by 4)\n\nSo, 6x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2 = 120\n\nWait, let me note that.\n\nSo, 6x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2 = 120.\n\nNow, let's go back to p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 = (120 y\u00b2) / (6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)\n\nBut note that the denominator is 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2. From the hyperbola equation, 6x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2 = 120, so 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 = ?\n\nLet me compute 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2.\n\nFrom 6x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2 = 120, I can express 6x\u00b2 = 5 y\u00b2 + 120.\n\nSo, 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 = 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2. Hmm, let's express it in terms of known quantities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 = - (5 x\u00b2 -6 y\u00b2) = - ( (5 x\u00b2 -6 y\u00b2) )\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me express 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2.\n\nFrom the hyperbola equation, 6x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2 = 120, so 6x\u00b2 = 5 y\u00b2 + 120.\n\nThus, 6 y\u00b2 = (5 y\u00b2 + 120)* (6 y\u00b2 /6x\u00b2). Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me write 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 as follows:\n\nFrom 6x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2 = 120,\n\nLet me compute 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2:\n\n= 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2\n= -(5x\u00b2 -6 y\u00b2)\n= -(5x\u00b2 -6 y\u00b2)\n\nBut from the hyperbola equation, 5x\u00b2 -6 y\u00b2 = -120.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom 6x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2 = 120,\n\nMultiply both sides by -1: -6x\u00b2 +5 y\u00b2 = -120\n\nWhich is 5 y\u00b2 -6 x\u00b2 = -120\n\nSo, 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 = ?\n\nWait, no, 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 is not directly related. Let me compute 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can express it in terms of the hyperbola equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a relationship between p and y.\n\nWait, let's take a step back.\n\nWe have:\n\nFrom equation (1): xp + yq = 0, so q = (-xp)/y\n\nFrom the hyperbola equation for point B:\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSubstituting q:\n\np\u00b2/20 - [ (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(y\u00b2) ] /24 = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) ] = 1\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\np\u00b2 = 1 / [1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2)]\n\nLet me write that as:\n\np\u00b2 = 1 / [ (24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2) / (20 *24 y\u00b2) ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\np\u00b2 = (20 *24 y\u00b2) / (24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2) = (480 y\u00b2) / (24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2)\n\nWhich is what we had before.\n\nBut from the hyperbola equation for point A:\n\n24x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 = 480\n\nSo, 24x\u00b2 = 20 y\u00b2 +480\n\nSo, 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 = 24 y\u00b2 - (20 y\u00b2 +480)/ (24/20) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I can express 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 in terms of the hyperbola equation.\n\nFrom 24x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 =480, so 24x\u00b2 =20 y\u00b2 +480.\n\nSo, 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 =24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps express it as:\n\n24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 =24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 = ?\n\nWe can factor 4:\n\n=4*(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)\n\nHmm, but from the hyperbola equation, 6x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2 =120, which can be written as:\n\n6x\u00b2 =5 y\u00b2 +120.\n\nSo, 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 =6 y\u00b2 -5*( (5 y\u00b2 +120)/6 )\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nFrom 6x\u00b2 =5 y\u00b2 +120,\n\nx\u00b2 = (5 y\u00b2 +120)/6\n\nSo, 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 =6 y\u00b2 -5*(5 y\u00b2 +120)/6\n\nCompute this:\n\n=6 y\u00b2 - (25 y\u00b2 + 600)/6\n\nConvert 6 y\u00b2 to 36 y\u00b2 /6:\n\n= (36 y\u00b2 -25 y\u00b2 -600)/6\n\n= (11 y\u00b2 -600)/6\n\nSo, 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 = (11 y\u00b2 -600)/6\n\nTherefore, 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 =4*(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2) =4*(11 y\u00b2 -600)/6 = (44 y\u00b2 -2400)/6 = (22 y\u00b2 -1200)/3\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = (480 y\u00b2) / (24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2) = (480 y\u00b2) / [ (22 y\u00b2 -1200)/3 ) ]\n\nWhich is:\n\np\u00b2 = (480 y\u00b2) * (3)/(22 y\u00b2 -1200) ) = (1440 y\u00b2)/(22 y\u00b2 -1200)\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = (1440 y\u00b2)/(22 y\u00b2 -1200)\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nFactor numerator: 1440 y\u00b2 = 1440 y\u00b2\n\nDenominator: 22 y\u00b2 -1200 = 22(y\u00b2 - 1200/22) = 22(y\u00b2 - 54.545...)\n\nBut perhaps we can factor 2 from denominator:\n\n22 y\u00b2 -1200 = 2*(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = (1440 y\u00b2) / [2*(11 y\u00b2 -600)] ) = (720 y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = (720 y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nNow, our goal is to compute BD\u00b2 =4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)\n\nBut we have q in terms of p and x and y: q = (-xp)/y\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/y\u00b2\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4(p\u00b2 + (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/y\u00b2 )=4 p\u00b2 (1 + x\u00b2 / y\u00b2 )\n\n=4 p\u00b2 ( (y\u00b2 +x\u00b2)/y\u00b2 )\n\nBut from hyperbola equation for point A:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1\n\nMultiply both sides by 20*24=480:\n\n24x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 =480\n\nSo, 24x\u00b2 =20 y\u00b2 +480\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = (20 y\u00b2 +480)/24 = (5 y\u00b2 +120)/6\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = (5 y\u00b2 +120)/6\n\nTherefore, x\u00b2/y\u00b2 = (5 y\u00b2 +120)/(6 y\u00b2 )= (5 + 120/y\u00b2)/6\n\nHmm, perhaps plug that into BD\u00b2.\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 p\u00b2 ( (y\u00b2 +x\u00b2)/y\u00b2 ) =4 p\u00b2 [1 + x\u00b2/y\u00b2 ]\n\nWe have x\u00b2/y\u00b2 = (5 y\u00b2 +120)/(6 y\u00b2 ) =5/(6) + 120/(6 y\u00b2 )=5/6 +20/y\u00b2\n\nSo, 1 + x\u00b2/y\u00b2 =1 +5/6 +20/y\u00b2=11/6 +20/y\u00b2\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2=4 p\u00b2 (11/6 +20/y\u00b2 )\n\nBut p\u00b2 is (720 y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4 * [ (720 y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 -600) ] * [11/6 +20/y\u00b2 ]\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, compute 4 *720 y\u00b2= 2880 y\u00b2\n\nThen, denominator is (11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nAnd the bracket term is 11/6 +20/y\u00b2\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= [2880 y\u00b2 / (11 y\u00b2 -600) ] * [11/6 +20/y\u00b2 ]\n\nLet me compute the second bracket term:\n\n11/6 +20/y\u00b2 = (11 y\u00b2 + 120)/ (6 y\u00b2 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= [2880 y\u00b2 / (11 y\u00b2 -600) ] * [ (11 y\u00b2 +120 )/(6 y\u00b2 ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n2880 y\u00b2 * (11 y\u00b2 +120 ) / [ (11 y\u00b2 -600 ) *6 y\u00b2 ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n2880 /6 =480\n\ny\u00b2 / y\u00b2 =1\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(11 y\u00b2 +120 )/(11 y\u00b2 -600 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(11 y\u00b2 +120 )/(11 y\u00b2 -600 )\n\nHmm, that's a function of y\u00b2. Let me denote t = y\u00b2. Then,\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11 t +120 )/(11 t -600 )\n\nSo, now, we can write BD\u00b2 as a function of t:\n\nf(t) =480*(11 t +120 )/(11 t -600 )\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of f(t). Since BD\u00b2 is expressed in terms of t, which is y\u00b2, and y\u00b2 must be positive. Also, from the hyperbola equation, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1, so y\u00b2 must satisfy x\u00b2=20(1 + y\u00b2/24) \u226520, so y can be any real number, but y\u00b2 must be such that x\u00b2 is positive, which it is for all real y.\n\nBut looking at the expression for p\u00b2, which is (720 y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 -600), the denominator 11 y\u00b2 -600 must not be zero, so y\u00b2 \u2260600/11\u224854.545.\n\nAlso, since p\u00b2 must be positive, the denominator 11 y\u00b2 -600 must have the same sign as the numerator 720 y\u00b2, which is always positive. So, denominator must be positive. Therefore,\n\n11 y\u00b2 -600 >0 => y\u00b2 >600/11 \u224854.545\n\nSo, t>600/11.\n\nSo, t>54.545.\n\nSo, our function is f(t)=480*(11 t +120)/(11 t -600 ) for t>600/11.\n\nWe can write f(t) as:\n\nf(t)=480*(11 t +120 )/(11 t -600 )\n\nLet me simplify this expression:\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:11 t +120 =11 t +120\n\nDenominator:11 t -600\n\nSo, f(t)=480*(11 t +120)/(11 t -600 )\n\nLet me perform polynomial division or rewrite this fraction.\n\nLet me write:\n\n(11t +120 )/(11t -600 )= [ (11t -600 ) +720 ]/(11t -600 )=1 + 720/(11t -600 )\n\nSo, f(t)=480*[1 +720/(11t -600 ) ]\n\n=480 + 480*720/(11t -600 )\n\nSo, f(t)=480 + (480*720)/(11t -600 )\n\nBut 480*720= 480*720= 345,600.\n\nSo, f(t)=480 + 345600/(11t -600 )\n\nNow, since t>600/11\u224854.545, denominator 11t -600 is positive, so 11t -600>0.\n\nSo, 345600/(11t -600 ) is positive, so f(t) is greater than 480.\n\nBut we need to find the minimal value of f(t), which would occur when 345600/(11t -600 ) is minimized, which is when denominator is maximized.\n\nBut wait, as t increases, denominator 11t -600 increases, so 345600/(11t -600 ) decreases, approaching zero as t approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, f(t) approaches 480 as t approaches infinity.\n\nBut is 480 the minimal value? Wait, but t can't be infinity, so f(t) can get arbitrarily close to 480 from above.\n\nWait, but we need to check whether f(t) can be less than 480 or not. Wait, since denominator is positive, and the expression is 480 + positive term, so f(t) is always greater than 480.\n\nSo, the minimal value of f(t) is 480, approached as t approaches infinity. Therefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut wait, we need to confirm if BD\u00b2 can actually reach 480 or not. Since as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, but never actually reaches it because t can't be infinity.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check the computations because sometimes during algebra mistakes can happen.\n\nWait, let's recap:\n\nWe started with BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 )\n\nExpressed q in terms of p, x, y.\n\nThen, using hyperbola equations, we expressed x\u00b2 in terms of y\u00b2, then substituted into BD\u00b2, leading to BD\u00b2 expressed as a function of y\u00b2, which is t.\n\nWe found that BD\u00b2=480 +345600/(11t -600 )\n\nAs t increases, the second term approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSince BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, the infimum is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 480.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the infimum is 480, so the answer is 480.\n\nBut let me just think if there's a way BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480.\n\nIf BD\u00b2=480, then 345600/(11t -600 )=0, which implies t approaches infinity, so y\u00b2 approaches infinity, which is not possible for a finite hyperbola. So, BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480 but can't actually reach it. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nThus, the answer is 480.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{480}\n\n\nGiven the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\), we need to find the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all rhombi \\(ABCD\\) whose diagonals intersect at the origin.\n\n1. The hyperbola equation is \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\).\n2. Points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) form a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Thus, if \\(A = (x, y)\\), then \\(C = (-x, -y)\\), and if \\(B = (p, q)\\), then \\(D = (-p, -q)\\).\n3. The diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) are perpendicular, leading to the condition \\(xp + yq = 0\\).\n4. The lengths of the diagonals are calculated. For diagonal \\(BD\\), the length is \\(2\\sqrt{p^2 + q^2}\\), so \\(BD^2 = 4(p^2 + q^2)\\).\n5. Using the hyperbola equations for points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), we derive the relationship between \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(p\\), and \\(q\\).\n6.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nThe hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right since the positive term is with x\u00b2. The transverse axis length is 2a, where a\u00b2 is 20, so a is sqrt(20), which is 2*sqrt(5). The conjugate axis is 2b, with b\u00b2=24, so b is 2*sqrt(6).\n\nNow, the problem mentions points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, and its diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That means the points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. But wait, the problem says ABCD is the rhombus. So, maybe it's better to think of the diagonals as AC and BD, intersecting at the origin.\n\nSince it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nI need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, find the supremum (least upper bound) of BD\u00b2. Wait, but the question says the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, maybe it's the infimum? Or perhaps I need to find the minimum BD\u00b2 and then take the greatest number less than that? Wait, no, it's asking for the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because the number needs to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, the infimum is the greatest lower bound, but the question is about a number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, so it's the infimum.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. Maybe the question is asking for the maximum possible value of BD\u00b2, but it's not possible to have a maximum since BD\u00b2 can approach infinity? But that doesn't make sense because the hyperbola is fixed, so maybe BD\u00b2 has some constraints.\n\nWait, no, the hyperbola is fixed, so the points A, B, C, D lie on it, and the rhombus is formed. So, BD is one of the diagonals, and we need to find the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all possible such rhombi. So, perhaps BD\u00b2 can be as large as possible, but we need the greatest number that is still less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. That would mean the infimum of BD\u00b2? No, wait, if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily small, then the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would be negative infinity, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, the number should be less than BD\u00b2 for every possible rhombus on the hyperbola as described. So, the number is a lower bound for BD\u00b2 across all such rhombi. The greatest such lower bound is the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, the question is to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi. So, I need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, which is the infimum, because then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be just below that minimum.\n\nWait, but BD\u00b2 can't be zero because the rhombus can't collapse to a line, right? Because the rhombus has four distinct points on the hyperbola. So, BD\u00b2 must be positive.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, and then the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the minimal BD\u00b2, but the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi,\" which is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach the problem.\n\nSince the rhombus is centered at the origin, the points A, C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B, D are endpoints of the other diagonal. So, A and C are opposite vertices, as are B and D.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint. So, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).\n\nSo, the four points are A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), D(-p, -q).\n\nSince all four points lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 and similarly for p and q.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, etc.\n\nSo, let's write expressions for the distances.\n\nAB distance squared: (x - p)\u00b2 + (y - q)\u00b2\n\nBC distance squared: (p + x)\u00b2 + (q + y)\u00b2\n\nSince AB = BC in a rhombus, so their squares are equal.\n\nSo, (x - p)\u00b2 + (y - q)\u00b2 = (p + x)\u00b2 + (q + y)\u00b2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft: x\u00b2 - 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2yq + q\u00b2\n\nRight: p\u00b2 + 2xp + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2yq + y\u00b2\n\nSubtract left from right:\n\n0 = (p\u00b2 + 2xp + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2yq + y\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 - 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2yq + q\u00b2)\n\nSimplify:\n\n0 = 4xp + 4yq\n\nSo, 4xp + 4yq = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nxp + yq = 0\n\nSo, this is a condition that the coordinates of A and B must satisfy.\n\nSimilarly, we can write other conditions, but perhaps this is the key condition.\n\nSo, xp + yq = 0.\n\nNow, we can also think about the diagonals. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nThe diagonals are AC and BD.\n\nThe slope of AC: since A is (x, y) and C is (-x, -y), the slope is ( -y - y ) / (-x - x ) = (-2y)/(-2x) = y/x.\n\nThe slope of BD: since B is (p, q) and D is (-p, -q), the slope is (-q - q)/(-p - p) = (-2q)/(-2p) = q/p.\n\nSo, for the diagonals to be perpendicular, (y/x) * (q/p) = -1.\n\nSo, (yq)/(xp) = -1\n\nBut from earlier, we have xp + yq = 0, which can be written as yq = -xp.\n\nSubstituting into the slope condition:\n\n(yq)/(xp) = (-xp)/(xp) = -1, which is correct. So, that condition is satisfied.\n\nSo, the condition xp + yq = 0 is necessary.\n\nNow, since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, we have:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have four equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\n2. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\n3. xp + yq = 0\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2.\n\nBD is the diagonal from B(p, q) to D(-p, -q). The length squared is (p - (-p))\u00b2 + (q - (-q))\u00b2 = (2p)\u00b2 + (2q)^2 = 4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, our target is to find the infimum of 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) given the constraints.\n\nSo, to find the minimal BD\u00b2, we can find the minimal value of 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), given that p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1 and xp + yq = 0, with x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we need to express everything in terms of one variable or find a relation between p and q.\n\nLet me think. From equation 3, xp + yq = 0, we can write x = (-yq)/p, provided p \u2260 0. Let's assume p \u2260 0 for now.\n\nThen, plug this into equation 1:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSubstitute x:\n\n[ ( (-yq)/p )\u00b2 ] /20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\n(y\u00b2 q\u00b2)/(20 p\u00b2) - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nFactor y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2 [ q\u00b2/(20 p\u00b2) - 1/24 ] = 1\n\nSimilarly, equation 2 is p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, let's denote equation 2 as:\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nLet me write both equations:\n\n1. y\u00b2 [ (q\u00b2)/(20 p\u00b2) - 1/24 ] = 1\n\n2. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nLet me denote equation 2 as:\n\nMultiply both sides by 24*20 = 480 to eliminate denominators:\n\n24 p\u00b2 - 20 q\u00b2 = 480\n\nSimilarly, equation 1 can be rewritten:\n\nLet me express equation 1:\n\ny\u00b2 [ (q\u00b2)/(20 p\u00b2) - 1/24 ] = 1\n\nLet me express this as:\n\ny\u00b2 [ (24 q\u00b2 - 20 p\u00b2) / (480 p\u00b2) ) ] = 1\n\nBecause (q\u00b2)/(20 p\u00b2) is q\u00b2/(20 p\u00b2) = (24 q\u00b2)/(480 p\u00b2), and 1/24 is (20 p\u00b2)/(480 p\u00b2). So,\n\n(q\u00b2)/(20 p\u00b2) - 1/24 = (24 q\u00b2 - 20 p\u00b2) / (480 p\u00b2)\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes:\n\ny\u00b2 * (24 q\u00b2 - 20 p\u00b2) / (480 p\u00b2) ) = 1\n\nBut from equation 2, 24 q\u00b2 - 20 p\u00b2 = -480 (since 24 p\u00b2 - 20 q\u00b2 = 480 => 24 q\u00b2 - 20 p\u00b2 = -480)\n\nSo, substituting 24 q\u00b2 - 20 p\u00b2 = -480 into equation 1:\n\ny\u00b2 * (-480) / (480 p\u00b2) = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\ny\u00b2 * (-1)/p\u00b2 = 1\n\nSo, -y\u00b2 / p\u00b2 = 1\n\nWhich implies y\u00b2 = -p\u00b2\n\nBut y\u00b2 and p\u00b2 are squares of real numbers, so they are non-negative. The only way y\u00b2 = -p\u00b2 is if y = 0 and p = 0, but p can't be zero because we divided by p earlier, and if p = 0, then from equation 2, q\u00b2 would have to be negative, which is impossible.\n\nWait, this is a problem. So, perhaps my assumption that p \u2260 0 is wrong? Or maybe I made a mistake in substitution.\n\nLet me go back.\n\nFrom equation 3, xp + yq = 0. If p = 0, then yq = 0. So, either y = 0 or q = 0.\n\nCase 1: p = 0.\n\nThen, from equation 2: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1 \u2192 0 - q\u00b2/24 = 1 \u2192 q\u00b2 = -24, which is impossible because q\u00b2 can't be negative.\n\nSo, p cannot be zero. Similarly, if q = 0, then from equation 3: xp = 0. But p \u2260 0, so x = 0. Then, from equation 1: 0 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 \u2192 y\u00b2 = -24, which is impossible.\n\nSo, neither p nor q can be zero. So, both p and q are non-zero, which allows us to write x = (-y q)/p.\n\nSo, going back, equation 1 leads to y\u00b2 = -p\u00b2, which is impossible because y\u00b2 and p\u00b2 are non-negative. So, that suggests that perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me double-check.\n\nFrom equation 1 after substitution:\n\ny\u00b2 [ q\u00b2/(20 p\u00b2) - 1/24 ] = 1\n\nAnd from equation 2: 24 p\u00b2 - 20 q\u00b2 = 480 \u2192 24 q\u00b2 - 20 p\u00b2 = -480\n\nSo, substituting into equation 1:\n\ny\u00b2 [ ( -480 ) / (480 p\u00b2) ) ] = 1\n\nWhich is y\u00b2 [ -1 / p\u00b2 ] = 1 \u2192 - y\u00b2 / p\u00b2 = 1 \u2192 y\u00b2 = -p\u00b2\n\nWhich is impossible because y\u00b2 and p\u00b2 are non-negative.\n\nHmm, this suggests that there's a contradiction. Maybe I messed up the substitution.\n\nWait, let me check the substitution again.\n\nEquation 1 after substitution:\n\n(y\u00b2 q\u00b2)/(20 p\u00b2) - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nFactor y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2 [ (q\u00b2)/(20 p\u00b2) - 1/24 ] = 1\n\nEquation 2 is 24 p\u00b2 - 20 q\u00b2 = 480\n\nSo, 24 p\u00b2 - 20 q\u00b2 = 480 \u2192 24 q\u00b2 - 20 p\u00b2 = -480\n\nWait, perhaps I can write (q\u00b2)/(20 p\u00b2) as [ q\u00b2/(20) ] / p\u00b2.\n\nBut let me try another approach. Let's consider parameterizing points on the hyperbola.\n\nThe hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. So, points on the hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions.\n\nLet me set x = a sec \u03b8, y = b tan \u03b8, where a\u00b2=20 and b\u00b2=24.\n\nSo, x = sqrt(20) sec \u03b8, y = sqrt(24) tan \u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, for point B, let me use a different parameter, say \u03c6.\n\nSo, point B is (sqrt(20) sec \u03c6, sqrt(24) tan \u03c6).\n\nSo, now, points A and B are (sqrt(20) sec \u03b8, sqrt(24) tan \u03b8) and (sqrt(20) sec \u03c6, sqrt(24) tan \u03c6).\n\nNow, the condition xp + yq = 0, which in this parametrization is x_A p + y_A q =0.\n\nSo, sqrt(20) sec \u03b8 * sqrt(20) sec \u03c6 + sqrt(24) tan \u03b8 * sqrt(24) tan \u03c6 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n20 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 + 24 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6 = 0\n\nSo, 20 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 = -24 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n20 / (cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6) = -24 (sin \u03b8 / cos \u03b8) (sin \u03c6 / cos \u03c6)\n\nMultiply both sides by cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6:\n\n20 = -24 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6\n\nSo,\n\n20 = -24 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 = -6 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6\n\nSo,\n\nsin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6\n\nThat's equation (A).\n\nNow, our target is to find BD\u00b2, which is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) where p = sqrt(20) sec \u03c6 and q = sqrt(24) tan \u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 [ (sqrt(20) sec \u03c6)^2 + (sqrt(24) tan \u03c6)^2 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n4 [ 20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6 ]\n\nWhich is 4 [ 20 (1 + tan\u00b2 \u03c6) + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6 ]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n20 + 20 tan\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6 = 20 + 44 tan\u00b2 \u03c6\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 (20 + 44 tan\u00b2 \u03c6) = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6\n\nSimilarly, from equation (A): sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6\n\nBut we need to relate this to tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nLet me think. Let me express sin \u03b8 in terms of sin \u03c6.\n\nFrom equation (A): sin \u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin \u03c6)\n\nBut sin \u03b8 must be between -1 and 1, so |(-5)/(6 sin \u03c6)| \u2264 1 \u2192 |5/(6 sin \u03c6)| \u22641 \u2192 |sin \u03c6| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, |sin \u03c6| \u2265 5/6.\n\nTherefore, sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2265 25/36.\n\nSo, cos\u00b2 \u03c6 = 1 - sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2264 1 - 25/36 = 11/36.\n\nSo, tan\u00b2 \u03c6 = sin\u00b2 \u03c6 / cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2265 (25/36)/(11/36) = 25/11 \u2248 2.27.\n\nSo, tan\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2265 25/11.\n\nSo, substituting back into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2265 80 + 176*(25/11)\n\nCalculate 176*(25/11):\n\n176 \u00f7 11 = 16\n\n16 *25 = 400\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 \u2265 80 + 400 = 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is at least 480. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 cannot be less than 480. So, 480 is the infimum. Hence, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, but wait, 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2. So, the number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would have to be less than or equal to 480. But since BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, no. Because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is \u2265480, so the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because 480 is less than or equal to all BD\u00b2, but the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2\". So, 480 is the infimum, but BD\u00b2 can be 480 exactly when tan\u00b2 \u03c6 is exactly 25/11, which would make BD\u00b2 exactly 480. So, the number must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Therefore, the number must be less than 480 because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480. So, the greatest such number is 480, but since it's not less than BD\u00b2 when BD\u00b2=480, it's actually the infimum, so the number must be less than 480.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nIf BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, then for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is at least 480. So, any number less than 480 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. The greatest such number is the supremum of numbers less than 480, which is 480 itself. But since BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 in that case. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, which is 480, but since 480 is attainable, the number must be strictly less than 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, but since 480 is attainable, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, no, if BD\u00b2 can be 480, then a number less than 480 would be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2. So, any number less than 480 would not be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi because when BD\u00b2 is 480, that number would be less than 480 but not less than BD\u00b2. Wait, no. Wait, 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2. So, for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is \u2265480. So, any number less than 480 would be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480. So, the greatest such number is 480, but since 480 is attainable, 480 is equal to BD\u00b2 in that case, so the number must be less than 480. So, the supremum is 480, but the number has to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, so the number must be less than or equal to 480, but since 480 is attainable, the number must be less than 480. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, but since 480 is attainable, the number must be less than 480, so the answer is 480, but since 480 is attainable, the number is approaching 480 from below. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but 480 is attainable, so the number cannot be 480 because it's not less than BD\u00b2 in that case. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, which is 480. But since 480 is attainable, the number must be less than 480. So, the answer is 480, but it's not included, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me think differently.\n\nWe found that BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480. So, for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480. So, the number we're looking for is the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Since BD\u00b2 can be 480, the number must be less than or equal to 480. But since it's required to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, and 480 is attainable, the number can be as close to 480 as possible, but not equal to or exceeding it. Therefore, the greatest such number is 480, but since 480 is attainable, the number must be less than 480. Therefore, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, since BD\u00b2 can be 480, any number less than 480 would satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But the greatest such number is 480. However, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 when BD\u00b2 is exactly 480. So, the number must be less than 480. Therefore, the greatest number is approaching 480 from below, but since we need an exact answer, perhaps 480 is acceptable because it's the infimum, and the problem might accept it as the answer.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again.\n\n\"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, the number must be less than BD\u00b2 for every rhombus. Since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, the number must be less than or equal to 480. But if the number is 480, then for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=480, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2. Therefore, the number must be less than 480.\n\nBut the question asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, the supremum of such numbers is 480, but since 480 cannot be achieved, the greatest number is 480. But since 480 is attainable, it's not less than BD\u00b2 in that case. So, the answer is 480, but it's not less than BD\u00b2 for that rhombus. Therefore, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased such that it's the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, so it's the infimum. Since BD\u00b2 is at least 480, the infimum is 480. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, the answer is 480.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nThe hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right since the positive term is with x\u00b2. The transverse axis length is 2a, where a\u00b2 is 20, so a is sqrt(20), which is 2*sqrt(5). The conjugate axis is 2b, with b\u00b2=24, so b is 2*sqrt(6).\n\nNow, the problem mentions points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, and its diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That means the points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. But wait, the problem says ABCD is the rhombus. So, maybe it's better to think of the diagonals as AC and BD, intersecting at the origin.\n\nSince it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nI need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, find the supremum (least upper bound) of BD\u00b2. Wait, but the question says the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, maybe it's the infimum? Or perhaps I need to find the minimum BD\u00b2 and then take the greatest number less than that? Wait, no, it's asking for the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because the number needs to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, the infimum is the greatest lower bound, but the question is about a number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, so it's the infimum.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. Maybe the question is asking for the maximum possible value of BD\u00b2, but it's not possible to have a maximum since BD\u00b2 can approach infinity? But that doesn't make sense because the hyperbola is fixed, so maybe BD\u00b2 has some constraints.\n\nWait, no, the hyperbola is fixed, so the points A, B, C, D lie on it, and the rhombus is formed. So, BD is one of the diagonals, and we need to find the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all possible such rhombi. So, perhaps BD\u00b2 can be as large as possible, but we need the greatest number that is still less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. That would mean the infimum of BD\u00b2? No, wait, if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily small, then the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would be negative infinity, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, the number should be less than BD\u00b2 for every possible rhombus on the hyperbola as described. So, the number is a lower bound for BD\u00b2 across all such rhombi. The greatest such lower bound is the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, the question is to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi. So, I need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, which is the infimum, because then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be just below that minimum.\n\nWait, but BD\u00b2 can't be zero because the rhombus can't collapse to a line, right? Because the rhombus has four distinct points on the hyperbola. So, BD\u00b2 must be positive.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, and then the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the minimal BD\u00b2, but the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi,\" which is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach the problem.\n\nSince the rhombus is centered at the origin, the points A, C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B, D are endpoints of the other diagonal. So, A and C are opposite vertices, as are B and D.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint. So, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).\n\nSo, the four points are A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), D(-p, -q).\n\nSince all four points lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 and similarly for p and q.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, etc.\n\nSo, let's write expressions for the distances.\n\nAB distance squared: (x - p)\u00b2 + (y - q)\u00b2\n\nBC distance squared: (p + x)\u00b2 + (q + y)\u00b2\n\nSince AB = BC in a rhombus, so their squares are equal.\n\nSo, (x - p)\u00b2 + (y - q)\u00b2 = (p + x)\u00b2 + (q + y)\u00b2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft: x\u00b2 - 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2yq + q\u00b2\n\nRight: p\u00b2 + 2xp + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2yq + y\u00b2\n\nSubtract left from right:\n\n0 = (p\u00b2 + 2xp + x\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2yq + y\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 - 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2yq + q\u00b2)\n\nSimplify:\n\n0 = 4xp + 4yq\n\nSo, 4xp + 4yq = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nxp + yq = 0\n\nSo, this is a condition that the coordinates of A and B must satisfy.\n\nSimilarly, we can write other conditions, but perhaps this is the key condition.\n\nSo, xp + yq = 0.\n\nNow, we can also think about the diagonals. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nThe diagonals are AC and BD.\n\nThe slope of AC: since A is (x, y) and C is (-x, -y), the slope is ( -y - y ) / (-x - x ) = (-2y)/(-2x) = y/x.\n\nThe slope of BD: since B is (p, q) and D is (-p, -q), the slope is (-q - q)/(-p - p) = (-2q)/(-2p) = q/p.\n\nSo, for the diagonals to be perpendicular, (y/x) * (q/p) = -1.\n\nSo, (yq)/(xp) = -1\n\nBut from earlier, we have xp + yq = 0, which can be written as yq = -xp.\n\nSubstituting into the slope condition:\n\n(yq)/(xp) = (-xp)/(xp) = -1, which is correct. So, that condition is satisfied.\n\nSo, the condition xp + yq = 0 is necessary.\n\nNow, since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, we have:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have four equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\n2. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\n3. xp + yq = 0\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2.\n\nBD is the diagonal from B(p, q) to D(-p, -q). The length squared is (p - (-p))\u00b2 + (q - (-q))\u00b2 = (2p)\u00b2 + (2q)^2 = 4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, our target is to find the infimum of 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) given the constraints.\n\nSo, to find the minimal BD\u00b2, we can find the minimal value of 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), given that p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1 and xp + yq = 0, with x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we need to express everything in terms of one variable or find a relation between p and q.\n\nLet me think. From equation 3, xp + yq = 0, we can write x = (-yq)/p, provided p \u2260 0. Let's assume p \u2260 0 for now.\n\nThen, plug this into equation 1:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSubstitute x:\n\n[ ( (-yq)/p )\u00b2 ] /20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\n(y\u00b2 q\u00b2)/(20 p\u00b2) - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nFactor y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2 [ q\u00b2/(20 p\u00b2) - 1/24 ] = 1\n\nSimilarly, equation 2 is p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, let's denote equation 2 as:\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nLet me write both equations:\n\n1. y\u00b2 [ (q\u00b2)/(20 p\u00b2) - 1/24 ] = 1\n\n2. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nLet me denote equation 2 as:\n\nMultiply both sides by 24*20 = 480 to eliminate denominators:\n\n24 p\u00b2 - 20 q\u00b2 = 480\n\nSimilarly, equation 1 can be rewritten:\n\nLet me express equation 1:\n\ny\u00b2 [ (q\u00b2)/(20 p\u00b2) - 1/24 ] = 1\n\nLet me express this as:\n\ny\u00b2 [ (24 q\u00b2 - 20 p\u00b2) / (480 p\u00b2) ) ] = 1\n\nBecause (q\u00b2)/(20 p\u00b2) is q\u00b2/(20 p\u00b2) = (24 q\u00b2)/(480 p\u00b2), and 1/24 is (20 p\u00b2)/(480 p\u00b2). So,\n\n(q\u00b2)/(20 p\u00b2) - 1/24 = (24 q\u00b2 - 20 p\u00b2) / (480 p\u00b2)\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes:\n\ny\u00b2 * (24 q\u00b2 - 20 p\u00b2) / (480 p\u00b2) ) = 1\n\nBut from equation 2, 24 q\u00b2 - 20 p\u00b2 = -480 (since 24 p\u00b2 - 20 q\u00b2 = 480 => 24 q\u00b2 - 20 p\u00b2 = -480)\n\nSo, substituting 24 q\u00b2 - 20 p\u00b2 = -480 into equation 1:\n\ny\u00b2 * (-480) / (480 p\u00b2) = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\ny\u00b2 * (-1)/p\u00b2 = 1\n\nSo, -y\u00b2 / p\u00b2 = 1\n\nWhich implies y\u00b2 = -p\u00b2\n\nBut y\u00b2 and p\u00b2 are squares of real numbers, so they are non-negative. The only way y\u00b2 = -p\u00b2 is if y = 0 and p = 0, but p can't be zero because we divided by p earlier, and if p = 0, then from equation 2, q\u00b2 would have to be negative, which is impossible.\n\nWait, this is a problem. So, perhaps my assumption that p \u2260 0 is wrong? Or maybe I made a mistake in substitution.\n\nLet me go back.\n\nFrom equation 3, xp + yq = 0. If p = 0, then yq = 0. So, either y = 0 or q = 0.\n\nCase 1: p = 0.\n\nThen, from equation 2: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1 \u2192 0 - q\u00b2/24 = 1 \u2192 q\u00b2 = -24, which is impossible because q\u00b2 can't be negative.\n\nSo, p cannot be zero. Similarly, if q = 0, then from equation 3: xp = 0. But p \u2260 0, so x = 0. Then, from equation 1: 0 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 \u2192 y\u00b2 = -24, which is impossible.\n\nSo, neither p nor q can be zero. So, both p and q are non-zero, which allows us to write x = (-y q)/p.\n\nSo, going back, equation 1 leads to y\u00b2 = -p\u00b2, which is impossible because y\u00b2 and p\u00b2 are non-negative. So, that suggests that perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me double-check.\n\nFrom equation 1 after substitution:\n\ny\u00b2 [ q\u00b2/(20 p\u00b2) - 1/24 ] = 1\n\nAnd from equation 2: 24 p\u00b2 - 20 q\u00b2 = 480 \u2192 24 q\u00b2 - 20 p\u00b2 = -480\n\nSo, substituting into equation 1:\n\ny\u00b2 [ ( -480 ) / (480 p\u00b2) ) ] = 1\n\nWhich is y\u00b2 [ -1 / p\u00b2 ] = 1 \u2192 - y\u00b2 / p\u00b2 = 1 \u2192 y\u00b2 = -p\u00b2\n\nWhich is impossible because y\u00b2 and p\u00b2 are non-negative.\n\nHmm, this suggests that there's a contradiction. Maybe I messed up the substitution.\n\nWait, let me check the substitution again.\n\nEquation 1 after substitution:\n\n(y\u00b2 q\u00b2)/(20 p\u00b2) - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nFactor y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2 [ (q\u00b2)/(20 p\u00b2) - 1/24 ] = 1\n\nEquation 2 is 24 p\u00b2 - 20 q\u00b2 = 480\n\nSo, 24 p\u00b2 - 20 q\u00b2 = 480 \u2192 24 q\u00b2 - 20 p\u00b2 = -480\n\nWait, perhaps I can write (q\u00b2)/(20 p\u00b2) as [ q\u00b2/(20) ] / p\u00b2.\n\nBut let me try another approach. Let's consider parameterizing points on the hyperbola.\n\nThe hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. So, points on the hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions.\n\nLet me set x = a sec \u03b8, y = b tan \u03b8, where a\u00b2=20 and b\u00b2=24.\n\nSo, x = sqrt(20) sec \u03b8, y = sqrt(24) tan \u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, for point B, let me use a different parameter, say \u03c6.\n\nSo, point B is (sqrt(20) sec \u03c6, sqrt(24) tan \u03c6).\n\nSo, now, points A and B are (sqrt(20) sec \u03b8, sqrt(24) tan \u03b8) and (sqrt(20) sec \u03c6, sqrt(24) tan \u03c6).\n\nNow, the condition xp + yq = 0, which in this parametrization is x_A p + y_A q =0.\n\nSo, sqrt(20) sec \u03b8 * sqrt(20) sec \u03c6 + sqrt(24) tan \u03b8 * sqrt(24) tan \u03c6 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n20 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 + 24 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6 = 0\n\nSo, 20 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 = -24 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n20 / (cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6) = -24 (sin \u03b8 / cos \u03b8) (sin \u03c6 / cos \u03c6)\n\nMultiply both sides by cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6:\n\n20 = -24 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6\n\nSo,\n\n20 = -24 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 = -6 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6\n\nSo,\n\nsin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6\n\nThat's equation (A).\n\nNow, our target is to find BD\u00b2, which is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) where p = sqrt(20) sec \u03c6 and q = sqrt(24) tan \u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 [ (sqrt(20) sec \u03c6)^2 + (sqrt(24) tan \u03c6)^2 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n4 [ 20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6 ]\n\nWhich is 4 [ 20 (1 + tan\u00b2 \u03c6) + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6 ]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n20 + 20 tan\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6 = 20 + 44 tan\u00b2 \u03c6\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 (20 + 44 tan\u00b2 \u03c6) = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6\n\nSimilarly, from equation (A): sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6\n\nBut we need to relate this to tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nLet me think. Let me express sin \u03b8 in terms of sin \u03c6.\n\nFrom equation (A): sin \u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin \u03c6)\n\nBut sin \u03b8 must be between -1 and 1, so |(-5)/(6 sin \u03c6)| \u2264 1 \u2192 |5/(6 sin \u03c6)| \u22641 \u2192 |sin \u03c6| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, |sin \u03c6| \u2265 5/6.\n\nTherefore, sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2265 25/36.\n\nSo, cos\u00b2 \u03c6 = 1 - sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2264 1 - 25/36 = 11/36.\n\nSo, tan\u00b2 \u03c6 = sin\u00b2 \u03c6 / cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2265 (25/36)/(11/36) = 25/11 \u2248 2.27.\n\nSo, tan\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2265 25/11.\n\nSo, substituting back into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6 \u2265 80 + 176*(25/11)\n\nCalculate 176*(25/11):\n\n176 \u00f7 11 = 16\n\n16 *25 = 400\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 \u2265 80 + 400 = 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is at least 480. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 cannot be less than 480. So, 480 is the infimum. Hence, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, but wait, 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2. So, the number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would have to be less than or equal to 480. But since BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, no. Because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is \u2265480, so the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because 480 is less than or equal to all BD\u00b2, but the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2\". So, 480 is the infimum, but BD\u00b2 can be 480 exactly when tan\u00b2 \u03c6 is exactly 25/11, which would make BD\u00b2 exactly 480. So, the number must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Therefore, the number must be less than 480 because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480. So, the greatest such number is 480, but since it's not less than BD\u00b2 when BD\u00b2=480, it's actually the infimum, so the number must be less than 480.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nIf BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, then for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is at least 480. So, any number less than 480 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. The greatest such number is the supremum of numbers less than 480, which is 480 itself. But since BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 in that case. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, which is 480, but since 480 is attainable, the number must be strictly less than 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, but since 480 is attainable, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, no, if BD\u00b2 can be 480, then a number less than 480 would be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2. So, any number less than 480 would not be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi because when BD\u00b2 is 480, that number would be less than 480 but not less than BD\u00b2. Wait, no. Wait, 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2. So, for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is \u2265480. So, any number less than 480 would be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480. So, the greatest such number is 480, but since 480 is attainable, 480 is equal to BD\u00b2 in that case, so the number must be less than 480. So, the supremum is 480, but the number has to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, so the number must be less than or equal to 480, but since 480 is attainable, the number must be less than 480. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, but since 480 is attainable, the number must be less than 480, so the answer is 480, but since 480 is attainable, the number is approaching 480 from below. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but 480 is attainable, so the number cannot be 480 because it's not less than BD\u00b2 in that case. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, which is 480. But since 480 is attainable, the number must be less than 480. So, the answer is 480, but it's not included, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me think differently.\n\nWe found that BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480. So, for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least 480. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480. So, the number we're looking for is the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Since BD\u00b2 can be 480, the number must be less than or equal to 480. But since it's required to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, and 480 is attainable, the number can be as close to 480 as possible, but not equal to or exceeding it. Therefore, the greatest such number is 480, but since 480 is attainable, the number must be less than 480. Therefore, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, since BD\u00b2 can be 480, any number less than 480 would satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But the greatest such number is 480. However, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 when BD\u00b2 is exactly 480. So, the number must be less than 480. Therefore, the greatest number is approaching 480 from below, but since we need an exact answer, perhaps 480 is acceptable because it's the infimum, and the problem might accept it as the answer.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again.\n\n\"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, the number must be less than BD\u00b2 for every rhombus. Since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, the number must be less than or equal to 480. But if the number is 480, then for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=480, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2. Therefore, the number must be less than 480.\n\nBut the question asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, the supremum of such numbers is 480, but since 480 cannot be achieved, the greatest number is 480. But since 480 is attainable, it's not less than BD\u00b2 in that case. So, the answer is 480, but it's not less than BD\u00b2 for that rhombus. Therefore, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased such that it's the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, so it's the infimum. Since BD\u00b2 is at least 480, the infimum is 480. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, the answer is 480.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all rhombi \\( ABCD \\) inscribed in the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin.\n\n1. **Hyperbola and Rhombus Properties**:\n   - The hyperbola is centered at the origin, opening horizontally.\n   - The rhombus \\( ABCD \\) has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, making the origin the midpoint of both diagonals.\n   - Points \\( A \\), \\( B \\), \\( C \\), and \\( D \\) lie on the hyperbola.\n\n2. **Conditions for the Rhombus**:\n   - The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular and bisect each other.\n   - Using parametrization, points on the hyperbola can be expressed using hyperbolic functions: \\( A = (\\sqrt{20} \\sec \\theta, \\sqrt{24} \\tan \\theta) \\) and \\( B = (\\sqrt{20} \\sec \\phi, \\sqrt{24} \\tan \\phi) \\).\n   - The condition \\( xp + yq = 0 \\) (from the perpendicularity of the diagonals) leads to the relation \\( \\sin \\theta \\sin \\phi = -\\frac{5}{6} \\).\n\n3. **Calculating \\( BD^2 \\)**:\n   - The length squared of diagonal \\( BD \\) is \\( 4(p^2 + q^2) \\), where \\( p = \\sqrt{20} \\sec \\phi \\) and \\( q = \\sqrt{24} \\tan \\phi \\).\n   - Substituting these into the expression for \\( BD^2 \\) gives \\( BD^2 = 80 + 176 \\tan^2 \\phi \\).\n\n4. **Minimizing \\( BD^2 \\)**:\n   - Using the condition \\( \\sin \\theta \\sin \\phi = -\\frac{5}{6} \\), it is derived that \\( \\tan^2 \\phi \\geq \\frac{25}{11} \\).\n   - Substituting this minimum value into \\( BD^2 \\) yields \\( BD^2 \\geq 480 \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since \\( BD^2 \\) can be as low as 480, the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{480}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again.\n\nIt says: Let A, B, C, D be points on the hyperbola (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1 such that ABCD is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nHmm, okay. So, we have a hyperbola, and four points on it forming a rhombus. The diagonals intersect at the origin, which makes sense because for a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so if they intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.\n\nSo, I need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. That is, find the infimum of BD\u00b2, or maybe the minimum possible BD\u00b2? Wait, no. It says the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, it's the supremum of the lower bounds. Hmm, maybe it's the minimal possible BD\u00b2, but not sure yet.\n\nWait, no, the problem is phrased as \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's like the maximum lower bound. So, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is the lower bound, and all BD\u00b2 are greater than or equal to that minimal value. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the minimal BD\u00b2, I think.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think. If all BD\u00b2 are greater than or equal to some number, say m, then m is the greatest lower bound. So, the answer is m, which is the infimum of BD\u00b2. So, we need to find the minimal BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi as described.\n\nSo, to proceed, I need to model the rhombus on the hyperbola.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? No, wait, not necessarily. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square.\n\nWait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square, but wait, actually, no, wait. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's correct. Because a rhombus is a special case of a kite, and in a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular, and since all sides are equal, it's a rhombus. So, yes, the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nSo, in this problem, ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if A is a point on the hyperbola, then C, being the opposite vertex, is the reflection of A across the origin. Similarly, B and D are reflections across the origin.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the four points can be represented as A(a, b), C(-a, -b), B(c, d), D(-c, -d).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal in length. So, the distance from A to B, B to C, C to D, and D to A must all be equal.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use vectors. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and the diagonals are AC and BD. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.\n\nSo, AC is the vector from A to C, which is (-2a, -2b). Similarly, BD is the vector from B to D, which is (-2c, -2d). But wait, no, vectors AC and BD are just from A to C and from B to D, but since the origin is the midpoint, AC is the vector from A to C, which is (-a - a, -b - b) = (-2a, -2b). Similarly, BD is the vector from B to D, which is (-c - c, -d - d) = (-2c, -2d). But wait, no, the vector AC is (C - A), so it's (-a - a, -b - b) = (-2a, -2b). Similarly, BD is (D - B) = (-c - c, -d - d) = (-2c, -2d).\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. So, (-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 0.\n\nWait, that would be (4ac) + (4bd) = 0. So, 4(ac + bd) = 0, which implies ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, that's one condition.\n\nAnother condition is that all sides are equal. So, the length of AB must equal the length of BC, etc.\n\nSo, let's compute the length of AB.\n\nPoint A is (a, b), point B is (c, d). So, AB\u00b2 = (a - c)\u00b2 + (b - d)\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, BC\u00b2 = (c - (-a))\u00b2 + (d - (-b))\u00b2 = (c + a)\u00b2 + (d + b)\u00b2.\n\nSince AB = BC, AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n(a - c)\u00b2 + (b - d)\u00b2 = (a + c)\u00b2 + (b + d)\u00b2.\n\nLet's expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: a\u00b2 - 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2bd + d\u00b2.\n\nRight side: a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2.\n\nSet them equal:\n\na\u00b2 - 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2bd + d\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2.\n\nSubtract a\u00b2, c\u00b2, b\u00b2, d\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n-2ac - 2bd = 2ac + 2bd.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n-2ac - 2bd - 2ac - 2bd = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-4ac -4bd = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by -4:\n\nac + bd = 0.\n\nWait, that's the same condition as before. So, the perpendicularity of the diagonals and the equality of sides lead to the same condition, ac + bd = 0. So, that's one equation.\n\nBut we also have the condition that all four points lie on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, A(a, b) is on the hyperbola, so (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, B(c, d) is on the hyperbola, so (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\n2. (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nAnd another equation:\n\n3. ac + bd = 0.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2. BD is the diagonal from B to D, so BD is the distance from B(c, d) to D(-c, -d).\n\nWait, no, BD is the diagonal from B to D, but since diagonals intersect at the origin, BD is the line from B to D, which is from (c, d) to (-c, -d). So, the length of BD is the distance between these two points.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (c - (-c))\u00b2 + (d - (-d))\u00b2 = (2c)\u00b2 + (2d)\u00b2 = 4c\u00b2 + 4d\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, AC is the diagonal from A(a, b) to C(-a, -b), so AC\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2).\n\nBut we are interested in BD\u00b2, so 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, we need to find BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), and find the minimal BD\u00b2, or perhaps the maximum lower bound.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. So, the minimal possible value of BD\u00b2, which is the greatest lower bound.\n\nSo, to find the minimal BD\u00b2, given that A and B lie on the hyperbola and ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, let's see. We have variables a, b, c, d with the conditions above.\n\nWe can think of this as a system of equations. Let me list them:\n\n1. (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\n2. (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\n3. ac + bd = 0.\n\nWe have four variables, but three equations. So, we can perhaps express some variables in terms of others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can parameterize points on the hyperbola.\n\nI know that hyperbola can be parameterized using hyperbolic functions, but maybe it's better to use a parametric form.\n\nAlternatively, for hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, a parametrization can be (a sec \u03b8, b tan \u03b8). Or sometimes (a cosh t, b sinh t), but that's for the right hyperbola.\n\nWait, but perhaps using the standard parametrization for hyperbola. Let's consider that.\n\nSo, for hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, we can parametrize points as (sqrt(20) sec \u03b8, sqrt(24) tan \u03b8). Alternatively, (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates (x, y) such that x = sqrt(20) sec \u03b8, y = sqrt(24) tan \u03b8.\n\nBut let me think: perhaps I can let point A be (sqrt(20) sec \u03b8, sqrt(24) tan \u03b8), and then point B is (sqrt(20) sec \u03c6, sqrt(24) tan \u03c6). Then, using the condition ac + bd = 0, which relates \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nWait, but I don't know if this is the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can express c and d in terms of a and b.\n\nFrom condition 3, ac + bd =0, so c = (-bd)/a, assuming a \u2260 0.\n\nBut then, substituting into equation 2: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nSo, substituting c = (-bd)/a into equation 2:\n\n[ ( (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2 ) ] /20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2) - d\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nFactor d\u00b2:\n\nd\u00b2 [ (b\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2) - 1/24 ] =1.\n\nSo, d\u00b2 = 1 / [ (b\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2) - 1/24 ].\n\nHmm, but this seems a bit complicated.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can use the hyperbola equations to relate a, b, c, d.\n\nFrom equation 1: (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nLet me solve for b\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 = (a\u00b2)/20 * 24 - 24*1.\n\nWait, no, rearranged:\n\n(a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1 \u2192 (b\u00b2)/24 = (a\u00b2)/20 -1 \u2192 b\u00b2=24*(a\u00b2/20 -1).\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1 \u2192 d\u00b2=24*(c\u00b2/20 -1).\n\nSo, substituting into equation 3: ac + bd =0.\n\nSo, c = (-bd)/a.\n\nSo, c = (-b d)/a.\n\nSo, let's square both sides: c\u00b2 = (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2.\n\nBut from equation 2: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1 \u2192 c\u00b2 = 20*(1 + (d\u00b2)/24).\n\nSo, substituting c\u00b2 into c\u00b2 = (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2:\n\n20*(1 + (d\u00b2)/24) = (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n20 + (20 d\u00b2)/24 = (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2.\n\nSimplify 20/24 to 5/6:\n\n20 + (5 d\u00b2)/6 = (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 6 to eliminate denominators:\n\n120 + 5 d\u00b2 = (6 b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2.\n\nNow, from equation 1, we have b\u00b2 =24*(a\u00b2/20 -1) = (24 a\u00b2)/20 -24 = (6 a\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, substituting b\u00b2 into the equation:\n\n120 +5 d\u00b2 = [6*( (6 a\u00b2/5 -24 ) d\u00b2 ) ] / a\u00b2.\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n6*(6 a\u00b2/5 -24) = (36 a\u00b2)/5 -144.\n\nSo, putting back:\n\n120 +5 d\u00b2 = [ (36 a\u00b2 /5 -144 ) d\u00b2 ] / a\u00b2.\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n(36 a\u00b2 /5 -144 ) / a\u00b2 = 36/5 - 144 / a\u00b2.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n120 +5 d\u00b2 = (36/5 - 144 / a\u00b2 ) d\u00b2.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n120 +5 d\u00b2 - (36/5) d\u00b2 + (144 / a\u00b2 ) d\u00b2 =0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n120 + [5 - 36/5 + 144/(a\u00b2)] d\u00b2 =0.\n\nCompute 5 - 36/5 = (25 -36)/5 = (-11)/5.\n\nSo,\n\n120 + [ (-11/5) + (144 / a\u00b2) ] d\u00b2 =0.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n[ (144 / a\u00b2) - (11/5) ] d\u00b2 +120=0.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should express d\u00b2 in terms of a\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of a single variable.\n\nWait, let's see. We have:\n\nFrom equation 1: b\u00b2 = (6 a\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nFrom equation 3: c = (-b d)/a.\n\nFrom equation 2: d\u00b2 =24*(c\u00b2/20 -1).\n\nSo, let's substitute c into equation 2.\n\nc = (-b d)/a \u2192 c\u00b2 = (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2.\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes:\n\nd\u00b2 =24*( (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2 ) -1 ).\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2 =24*( (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2 ) -1 ).\n\nLet's rearrange:\n\nd\u00b2 +24*( (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2 ) ) =24.\n\nFactor d\u00b2:\n\nd\u00b2 [1 + (24 b\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2) ] =24.\n\nSimplify 24/20 to 6/5:\n\nd\u00b2 [1 + (6 b\u00b2)/(5 a\u00b2) ] =24.\n\nFrom equation 1, b\u00b2 = (6 a\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, substitute that into the expression:\n\nd\u00b2 [1 + (6*(6 a\u00b2/5 -24 ))/(5 a\u00b2) ] =24.\n\nCompute the term inside the brackets:\n\nFirst, compute 6*(6 a\u00b2/5 -24 ) = (36 a\u00b2)/5 -144.\n\nSo, the term becomes:\n\n1 + (36 a\u00b2/5 -144 )/(5 a\u00b2).\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n(36 a\u00b2/5 -144 )/(5 a\u00b2 ) = (36/25) - (144)/(5 a\u00b2).\n\nSo, the entire expression inside the brackets is:\n\n1 + (36/25) - (144)/(5 a\u00b2) = (25/25 +36/25) - (144)/(5 a\u00b2) = (61/25) - (144)/(5 a\u00b2).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nd\u00b2 [61/25 - 144/(5 a\u00b2) ] =24.\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2 =24 / [61/25 - 144/(5 a\u00b2) ].\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy, but perhaps manageable.\n\nSo, now, let's express BD\u00b2 in terms of a\u00b2.\n\nBD\u00b2 =4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2).\n\nBut c\u00b2 = (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2, from equation 3.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 =4*( (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 ) =4 d\u00b2 ( (b\u00b2)/a\u00b2 +1 ).\n\nFrom equation 1, b\u00b2 = (6 a\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo,\n\n(b\u00b2)/a\u00b2 = (6/5) -24/a\u00b2.\n\nThus,\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 d\u00b2 [ (6/5 -24/a\u00b2 ) +1 ] =4 d\u00b2 [11/5 -24/a\u00b2 ].\n\nBut from earlier, we have:\n\nd\u00b2 =24 / [61/25 - 144/(5 a\u00b2) ].\n\nSo, let's substitute that into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 * [24 / (61/25 -144/(5 a\u00b2)) ] * [11/5 -24/a\u00b2 ].\n\nThis is getting really complicated, but let's try to simplify step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute the denominator in the d\u00b2 expression:\n\n61/25 -144/(5 a\u00b2) = (61 a\u00b2 -144*5 )/(25 a\u00b2 )= (61 a\u00b2 -720 )/(25 a\u00b2 ).\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2 =24 / [ (61 a\u00b2 -720 )/(25 a\u00b2 ) ] =24 * (25 a\u00b2 )/(61 a\u00b2 -720 )= (600 a\u00b2 )/(61 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSimilarly, the term [11/5 -24/a\u00b2 ] can be written as (11 a\u00b2 -120 )/(5 a\u00b2 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 becomes:\n\n4 * (600 a\u00b2 )/(61 a\u00b2 -720 ) * (11 a\u00b2 -120 )/(5 a\u00b2 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n4 * (600 a\u00b2 * (11 a\u00b2 -120 )) / [ (61 a\u00b2 -720 ) *5 a\u00b2 ].\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:4 *600 a\u00b2 (11 a\u00b2 -120 ) =2400 a\u00b2 (11 a\u00b2 -120 ).\n\nDenominator:5 a\u00b2 (61 a\u00b2 -720 )=5 a\u00b2 (61 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = [2400 a\u00b2 (11 a\u00b2 -120 ) ] / [5 a\u00b2 (61 a\u00b2 -720 ) ].\n\nCancel a\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 = [2400 (11 a\u00b2 -120 ) ] / [5 (61 a\u00b2 -720 ) ].\n\nSimplify 2400 /5 =480:\n\nBD\u00b2 =480 (11 a\u00b2 -120 ) / (61 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =480*(11 a\u00b2 -120)/(61 a\u00b2 -720).\n\nHmm, that's a function of a\u00b2. Let me denote t = a\u00b2. Then,\n\nBD\u00b2 =480*(11 t -120)/(61 t -720).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 =480*(11t -120)/(61 t -720).\n\nNow, we can simplify this expression:\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 11t -120.\n\nDenominator:61 t -720.\n\nHmm, let me see if I can write this as a constant plus something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps perform polynomial division.\n\nDivide 11t -120 by 61t -720.\n\nLet me write 11t -120 = (11/61)(61 t -720) + remainder.\n\nCompute (11/61)(61 t -720 )=11 t - (11*720)/61=11 t - 7920/61.\n\nSubtract this from numerator:\n\n(11t -120) - (11t -7920/61 )= -120 +7920/61= (-120*61 +7920)/61= (-7320 +7920)/61=600/61.\n\nSo,\n\n11t -120 = (11/61)(61t -720) +600/61.\n\nSo,\n\n(11t -120)/(61 t -720 )=11/61 + (600/61)/(61t -720).\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11/61 + (600/61)/(61t -720 ))=480*(11/61) +480*(600/61)/(61t -720 ).\n\nCompute 480*(11/61)= (480*11)/61=5280/61\u224886.557.\n\nAnd 480*(600/61)=288000/61\u22484721.311.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2\u224886.557 + (4721.311)/(61t -720).\n\nHmm, so as t increases, the second term tends to zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches approximately 86.557.\n\nBut we need to find the minimal BD\u00b2, which would occur when the second term is as negative as possible, but we need to ensure that the denominator (61t -720) is positive because otherwise, the fraction would be negative, which would make BD\u00b2 smaller.\n\nWait, but t is a\u00b2, and since A is on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1, a\u00b2 must be \u226520, because x\u00b2/20 \u22651 \u2192x\u00b2\u226520.\n\nSo, t = a\u00b2 \u226520.\n\nSo, 61t -720 =61*(a\u00b2) -720. Let's compute when 61t -720 is positive or negative.\n\n61t -720 \u22650 \u2192 t\u2265720/61\u224811.803.\n\nBut t is already \u226520, so 61t -720 is positive for t\u226520.\n\nSo, the denominator is positive, and the numerator of the second term is positive, so the entire fraction is positive, so BD\u00b2 is larger than 5280/61\u224886.557.\n\nWait, but that's the minimal value, right? Because as t increases, the second term decreases, so BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/61 from above.\n\nWait, but 5280 divided by 61 is approximately 86.557, but let me compute it exactly.\n\n61*86=5246, 61*86=5246, 5280-5246=34, so 5280/61=86 +34/61=86.557.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=5280/61 + (288000/61)/(61t -720 ).\n\nSince 61t -720 is positive, and as t increases, the second term becomes smaller, so BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/61\u224886.557 from above. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 5280/61, but is this achievable?\n\nWait, when t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/61. So, 5280/61 is the infimum, but it's not achieved because as t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches it asymptotically.\n\nBut wait, let me check if t can be exactly 720/61\u224811.803, but t is a\u00b2 which is at least 20, so t is always greater than 20.\n\nWait, so 61t -720 is always positive, as t\u226520. So, the second term is positive, so BD\u00b2 is always greater than 5280/61.\n\nSo, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 5280/61, which is approximately 86.557.\n\nBut wait, 5280 divided by 61: let me compute 61*86=5246, 61*87=5246+61=5307. So, 5280 is between 86 and 87.\n\n5280-5246=34, so 5280/61=86 +34/61=86.557...\n\nSo, 5280/61 is the minimal value, but is it attainable? Since t can't be less than 20, and as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/61.\n\nWait, but if t approaches 20 from above, then 61t approaches 61*20=1220, so 61t -720 approaches 1220 -720=500.\n\nSo, the second term becomes (288000/61)/500= (288000)/(61*500)=288000/30500\u22489.442.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2\u224886.557 +9.442\u224896 when t is 20.\n\nAs t increases, the second term decreases, so BD\u00b2 decreases towards 86.557.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 5280/61, but is it attainable?\n\nWait, if t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/61, but for finite t, it's always larger.\n\nSo, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is 5280/61, but it's not achieved by any finite rhombus.\n\nBut the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum, which is 5280/61.\n\nBut let me check if 5280/61 is correct.\n\nWait, let me compute 61*86=5246, 61*86=5246, 5280-5246=34, so 5280=61*86 +34.\n\nSo, 5280/61=86 +34/61=86.557.\n\nBut wait, let me see if this is indeed the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the expression for BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, let's double-check.\n\nWe had BD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nLet me see if I can simplify this fraction.\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator:11t -120.\n\nDenominator:61t -720.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor out 11 and 61:\n\nBut 11 and 61 are primes, so not much to factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps write numerator as 11t -120 =11(t) -120.\n\nDenominator:61 t -720=61(t) -720.\n\nHmm, not much help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that 11t -120 and 61t -720 can be expressed in terms of each other.\n\nWait, 61t -720 = (61/11)*(11t) -720.\n\nBut 61/11 is approximately 5.545, which is messy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express as:\n\nLet me write BD\u00b2 as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720)=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nLet me divide numerator and denominator by t:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11 -120/t)/(61 -720/t).\n\nAs t approaches infinity, this tends to 480*(11)/61= (480*11)/61=5280/61\u224886.557.\n\nSo, as t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/61.\n\nSince t cannot be less than 20, but can be as large as possible, so the infimum is 5280/61.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 5280/61.\n\nBut let me compute 5280 divided by 61.\n\nCompute 61*80=4880, 5280-4880=400.\n\n61*6=366, 400-366=34.\n\nSo, 61*86=61*(80+6)=4880+366=5246.\n\n5280-5246=34.\n\nSo, 5280/61=86 +34/61=86.557...\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 5280/61, which is approximately 86.557.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 5280/61.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this is indeed the minimal value.\n\nWait, another approach: since BD\u00b2 =4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2), and points B and D are on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, for point B(c, d), we have c\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo, c\u00b2=20(1 +d\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2)=4[20(1 +d\u00b2/24) +d\u00b2 ]=4[20 + (20 d\u00b2)/24 +d\u00b2 ]=4[20 + (5 d\u00b2)/6 +d\u00b2 ]=4[20 + (11 d\u00b2)/6 ].\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=80 + (44 d\u00b2)/6=80 + (22 d\u00b2)/3.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3)d\u00b2.\n\nHmm, but we also have the condition ac + bd=0.\n\nBut since A(a, b) is on the hyperbola, a\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo, maybe we can express d in terms of a, or something.\n\nWait, but this seems a different approach. Let me see.\n\nWait, from BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3)d\u00b2.\n\nSo, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize d\u00b2.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when d\u00b2 is as small as possible.\n\nSo, what's the minimal possible d\u00b2 for point B(c, d) on the hyperbola?\n\nBut d can't be zero because then point B would be on the x-axis, but then point D would be (-c, -d)=(-c, 0), which would make BD a horizontal line, but then the diagonals AC and BD would need to be perpendicular.\n\nBut wait, if d=0, then BD would be horizontal, and AC would need to be vertical to be perpendicular. But AC is from (a,b) to (-a, -b), so unless b=0, which would make AC horizontal, but then if AC is horizontal and BD is horizontal, they can't be perpendicular unless both are zero, which is not possible.\n\nSo, d can't be zero. So, d must satisfy some condition.\n\nWait, but the minimal d\u00b2 occurs when point B is as close as possible to the origin on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1.\n\nThe minimal y\u00b2 occurs when x is as small as possible, which is x\u00b2=20, so y\u00b2=24*(x\u00b2/20 -1)=24*(1 -1)=0. But that's the vertex. But as we saw, d can't be zero because of the rhombus condition.\n\nWait, but if d approaches zero, then BD\u00b2 approaches 80 +0=80.\n\nBut from earlier approach, the minimal BD\u00b2 was 5280/61\u224886.557, which is higher than 80.\n\nSo, there must be a contradiction. So, perhaps my earlier approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 isn't 5280/61, but higher.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nIf BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3)d\u00b2, then to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize d\u00b2.\n\nBut point B(c, d) is on hyperbola, so c\u00b2=20(1 +d\u00b2/24).\n\nBut from the condition ac + bd=0.\n\nFrom this, c= (-b d)/a.\n\nSo, substituting c into c\u00b2=20(1 +d\u00b2/24):\n\n[ (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2 ]=20(1 +d\u00b2/24 ).\n\nSo,\n\n(b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2=20 + (20 d\u00b2)/24=20 + (5 d\u00b2)/6.\n\nFrom equation 1, a\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24=1 \u2192 b\u00b2=24(a\u00b2/20 -1)= (6 a\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, substituting b\u00b2 into the equation:\n\n[ ( (6 a\u00b2/5 -24 ) d\u00b2 ) /a\u00b2 ]=20 + (5 d\u00b2)/6.\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n(6 a\u00b2/5 -24 ) d\u00b2 /a\u00b2 = (6/5 -24/a\u00b2 ) d\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n(6/5 -24/a\u00b2 ) d\u00b2 =20 + (5 d\u00b2)/6.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n(6/5 -24/a\u00b2 ) d\u00b2 - (5 d\u00b2)/6 -20=0.\n\nFactor d\u00b2:\n\nd\u00b2 [6/5 -24/a\u00b2 -5/6 ] -20=0.\n\nCompute the coefficient:\n\n6/5 -5/6 = (36 -25)/30=11/30.\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2 [11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ] -20=0.\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2 [11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ] =20.\n\nThus,\n\nd\u00b2=20 / [11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ].\n\nHmm, so we have d\u00b2=20 / [11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ].\n\nNow, since d\u00b2 must be positive, the denominator must be positive.\n\nSo,\n\n11/30 -24/a\u00b2 >0 \u219224/a\u00b2 <11/30 \u2192a\u00b2>24*(30)/11=720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 must be greater than 720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, the minimal a\u00b2 is 720/11, but since a\u00b2 must be \u226520, and 720/11\u224865.45>20, so the minimal a\u00b2 is 720/11.\n\nWait, but if a\u00b2>720/11, then d\u00b2 is positive.\n\nSo, the minimal a\u00b2 is 720/11, which gives the maximal d\u00b2?\n\nWait, no, if a\u00b2 approaches 720/11 from above, then the denominator approaches zero, so d\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, no, if a\u00b2 approaches 720/11 from above, then 24/a\u00b2 approaches 24/(720/11)= (24*11)/720=264/720=11/30.\n\nSo, denominator 11/30 -24/a\u00b2 approaches 11/30 -11/30=0.\n\nSo, d\u00b2 approaches 20 /0 \u2192 infinity.\n\nWait, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, but perhaps when a\u00b2 is larger, the denominator becomes positive?\n\nWait, no, wait, 11/30 -24/a\u00b2.\n\nIf a\u00b2 is large, 24/a\u00b2 approaches zero, so denominator approaches 11/30, which is positive.\n\nSo, for a\u00b2>720/11\u224865.4545, the denominator is positive, so d\u00b2 is positive.\n\nSo, when a\u00b2 approaches 720/11 from above, d\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWhen a\u00b2 approaches infinity, d\u00b2 approaches 20/(11/30)=20*(30/11)=600/11\u224854.545.\n\nSo, d\u00b2 is between 600/11\u224854.545 and infinity.\n\nSo, the minimal d\u00b2 is 600/11, achieved as a\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3) d\u00b2.\n\nSo, minimal BD\u00b2 is when d\u00b2 is minimal, which is 600/11.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=80 + (22/3)*(600/11)=80 + (22*600)/(3*11)=80 + (13200)/(33)=80 +400=480.\n\nWait, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as a\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the earlier result where BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/61\u224886.557.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach.\n\nWait, in this approach, BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3) d\u00b2, and d\u00b2=20 / [11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ].\n\nSo, as a\u00b2 approaches infinity, d\u00b2 approaches 20/(11/30)=600/11\u224854.545.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 80 + (22/3)*(600/11)=80 + (22*600)/(33)=80 + (13200/33)=80 +400=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as a\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut earlier, when I expressed BD\u00b2 in terms of t=a\u00b2, I got BD\u00b2 approaching 5280/61\u224886.557 as t approaches infinity.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nHmm, seems like a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach when I expressed BD\u00b2 in terms of t.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut when t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480*(11t)/(61t)=480*(11/61)=5280/61\u224886.557.\n\nBut in the second approach, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, clearly, I have a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, perhaps in the first approach, when I expressed BD\u00b2=4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2), but from the second approach, BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3)d\u00b2.\n\nSo, let me compute 4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2) and see if it equals 80 + (22/3)d\u00b2.\n\nFrom equation 2, c\u00b2=20(1 +d\u00b2/24).\n\nSo,\n\n4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2)=4[20(1 +d\u00b2/24) +d\u00b2 ]=4[20 + (20 d\u00b2)/24 +d\u00b2 ]=4[20 + (5 d\u00b2)/6 +d\u00b2 ]=4[20 + (11 d\u00b2)/6 ]=80 + (44 d\u00b2)/6=80 + (22 d\u00b2)/3.\n\nYes, so BD\u00b2=80 + (22 d\u00b2)/3.\n\nSo, the second approach is correct.\n\nBut in the first approach, I had BD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut if t approaches infinity, this approaches 480*11/61\u224886.557, which conflicts with the second approach's conclusion that BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach when I substituted variables.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nIn the first approach, I had:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut from the second approach, as a\u00b2 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, perhaps the first approach is wrong.\n\nWait, let me check the first approach again.\n\nIn the first approach, I had:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut in reality, from the second approach, as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, so the first approach's conclusion that BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/61 must be wrong.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach.\n\nWait, let's check.\n\nIn the first approach, I had:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut in reality, as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480*(11/61)*t / (61/61 t )=480*(11/61)/1=480*(11/61)=5280/61\u224886.557.\n\nBut in the second approach, as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, this inconsistency suggests that one of the approaches is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parametrization in the first approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution steps.\n\nLet me check the first approach:\n\nWe had:\n\nBD\u00b2=4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2).\n\nBut c= (-b d)/a.\n\nSo,\n\nc\u00b2= (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2.\n\nFrom equation 2, c\u00b2=20(1 +d\u00b2/24).\n\nSo,\n\n(b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2=20(1 +d\u00b2/24).\n\nFrom equation 1, b\u00b2= (6 a\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n[ (6 a\u00b2/5 -24 ) d\u00b2 ] /a\u00b2=20(1 +d\u00b2/24 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n(6/5 -24/a\u00b2 ) d\u00b2=20 + (5 d\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo,\n\n(6/5 -24/a\u00b2 ) d\u00b2 - (5 d\u00b2)/6 =20.\n\nFactor d\u00b2:\n\nd\u00b2 [6/5 -24/a\u00b2 -5/6 ]=20.\n\nCompute 6/5 -5/6= (36 -25)/30=11/30.\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2 [11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ]=20.\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2=20 / [11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ].\n\nWhich is consistent with the second approach.\n\nSo, in the first approach, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I had:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut from the second approach, BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3) d\u00b2=80 + (22/3)*(20 / [11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ]).\n\nSo, perhaps in the first approach, I had an error in substituting expressions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach when expressing BD\u00b2 in terms of t.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed with the second approach, which seems more straightforward.\n\nSo, in the second approach, we have:\n\nBD\u00b2=80 + (22/3) d\u00b2.\n\nAnd d\u00b2=20 / [11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ].\n\nBut a\u00b2 must be greater than 720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, as a\u00b2 approaches infinity, d\u00b2 approaches 20/(11/30)=600/11\u224854.545.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 80 + (22/3)*(600/11)=80 + (22*600)/(3*11)=80 + (13200)/33=80 +400=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as a\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but that seems to suggest that BD\u00b2 can approach 480, but can't go below that.\n\nBut wait, no, because as a\u00b2 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as a\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut when a\u00b2 increases, d\u00b2 approaches 600/11\u224854.545, so BD\u00b2 approaches 80 + (22/3)*(54.545)=80 + (22/3)*54.545.\n\nCompute 54.545*(22/3)= (54.545*22)/3\u2248(1200)/3=400.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 80 +400=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as a\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut when a\u00b2 is minimal, which is a\u00b2=720/11\u224865.4545, then d\u00b2=20/[11/30 -24/(720/11)]=20/[11/30 - (24*11)/720 ].\n\nCompute 24*11=264, 264/720=11/30.\n\nSo, denominator=11/30 -11/30=0.\n\nSo, d\u00b2 approaches infinity as a\u00b2 approaches 720/11 from above.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity as a\u00b2 approaches 720/11 from above.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the earlier conclusion.\n\nSo, as a\u00b2 increases from 720/11 to infinity, d\u00b2 decreases from infinity to 600/11, so BD\u00b2 decreases from infinity to 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, but the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, approached as a\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut wait, that seems to suggest that the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut earlier, in the first approach, I thought the minimal BD\u00b2 was 5280/61\u224886.557.\n\nBut according to the second approach, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach.\n\nWait, let me check the first approach again.\n\nIn the first approach, I expressed BD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut with t=a\u00b2, which is greater than 720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, let's compute BD\u00b2 when t=720/11.\n\nCompute numerator:11t -120=11*(720/11) -120=720 -120=600.\n\nDenominator:61t -720=61*(720/11) -720= (61*720 -720*11)/11=720*(61 -11)/11=720*50/11=36000/11.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(600)/(36000/11)=480*(600*11)/36000=480*(6600)/36000=480*(11/60)= (480/60)*11=8*11=88.\n\nWait, that's 88.\n\nWait, so when t=720/11\u224865.4545, BD\u00b2=88.\n\nBut earlier, when a\u00b2 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, that suggests that BD\u00b2 can vary from 88 to 480.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 88, and the maximal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the second approach.\n\nWait, but in the second approach, we saw that when a\u00b2 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, and when a\u00b2 approaches 720/11 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut in the first approach, when t=720/11, BD\u00b2=88.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute d\u00b2 when t=720/11.\n\nFrom d\u00b2=20/[11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ].\n\na\u00b2=720/11.\n\nSo, 24/a\u00b2=24/(720/11)= (24*11)/720=264/720=11/30.\n\nSo, denominator=11/30 -11/30=0.\n\nSo, d\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut in the first approach, BD\u00b2=88 when t=720/11.\n\nSo, how come?\n\nWait, maybe in the first approach, when t=720/11, BD\u00b2=88, but in reality, d\u00b2 is infinity, which would make BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3)*d\u00b2 also approach infinity.\n\nSo, there must be a mistake in the first approach.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I had BD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut when t=720/11, BD\u00b2=480*(600)/(36000/11)=480*(600*11)/36000=480*(6600)/36000=480*(11/60)=88.\n\nBut according to the second approach, BD\u00b2 should approach infinity as t approaches 720/11 from above.\n\nSo, this suggests that the first approach is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in the first approach.\n\nWait, perhaps when I expressed BD\u00b2 in terms of t, I substituted incorrectly.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nIn the first approach, I had:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut when t=720/11, BD\u00b2=480*(11*(720/11) -120)/(61*(720/11) -720)=480*(720 -120)/( (61*720)/11 -720 ).\n\nCompute numerator:720 -120=600.\n\nDenominator: (61*720 -720*11)/11=720*(61 -11)/11=720*50/11=36000/11.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(600)/(36000/11)=480*600*11/36000=480*6600/36000=480*(11/60)=88.\n\nBut in reality, when a\u00b2=720/11, d\u00b2 approaches infinity, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, the first approach must have a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression for BD\u00b2 in terms of t is incorrect.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I had:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut according to the second approach, BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3) d\u00b2.\n\nAnd d\u00b2=20/[11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ].\n\nSo, when t=720/11, a\u00b2=720/11, so d\u00b2 is undefined, as denominator approaches zero.\n\nBut in the first approach, BD\u00b2=88 when t=720/11, but in reality, BD\u00b2 should approach infinity.\n\nSo, the first approach is wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps the mistake is in the first approach's substitution.\n\nWait, in the first approach, after a lot of substitutions, I arrived at BD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut perhaps this is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in expressing BD\u00b2 in terms of t.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct minimal BD\u00b2 is 88, achieved when a\u00b2=720/11.\n\nBut when a\u00b2=720/11, d\u00b2 approaches infinity, which contradicts.\n\nSo, I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think geometrically.\n\nGiven that the diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular and intersect at the origin, and all four points lie on the hyperbola.\n\nThe diagonals are AC and BD, with midpoints at the origin.\n\nSo, AC is a diagonal from A(a, b) to C(-a, -b), so AC has length 2\u221a(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, BD is from B(c, d) to D(-c, -d), so BD has length 2\u221a(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2).\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the dot product of vectors AC and BD is zero.\n\nSo, (a, b)\u00b7(c, d)=ac + bd=0.\n\nSo, points A and B are such that ac + bd=0.\n\nMoreover, both A and B lie on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal possible BD\u00b2=4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2), given that ac + bd=0, and a\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24=1, c\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo, we can think of this as an optimization problem: minimize BD\u00b2=4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2) subject to the constraints ac + bd=0, a\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24=1, c\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24=1.\n\nThis can be approached using Lagrange multipliers, but it might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps parameterize points A and B.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nSince ac + bd=0, we can write d= - (ac)/b, provided b\u22600.\n\nBut since points are on hyperbola, b can't be zero because then a\u00b2=20, and d would be zero, which is not allowed as before.\n\nSo, substituting d= - (ac)/b into equation for point B.\n\nPoint B(c, d) is on hyperbola, so c\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo,\n\nc\u00b2/20 - (a\u00b2 c\u00b2)/(24 b\u00b2 )=1.\n\nFactor c\u00b2:\n\nc\u00b2 [1/20 - a\u00b2/(24 b\u00b2 ) ]=1.\n\nFrom equation for point A: a\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24=1 \u2192 b\u00b2=24(a\u00b2/20 -1)= (6 a\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, substitute b\u00b2 into the expression:\n\nc\u00b2 [1/20 - a\u00b2/(24*(6 a\u00b2/5 -24 )) ]=1.\n\nSimplify the term inside the brackets:\n\nCompute denominator:24*(6 a\u00b2/5 -24 )= (144 a\u00b2)/5 -576.\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2/( (144 a\u00b2)/5 -576 )= (5 a\u00b2)/(144 a\u00b2 -2880 ).\n\nSo,\n\n1/20 - (5 a\u00b2)/(144 a\u00b2 -2880 )= [ (144 a\u00b2 -2880 ) -100 a\u00b2 ] / [20*(144 a\u00b2 -2880 ) ].\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n144 a\u00b2 -2880 -100 a\u00b2=44 a\u00b2 -2880.\n\nSo,\n\n[44 a\u00b2 -2880 ] / [20*(144 a\u00b2 -2880 ) ].\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:4*(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nDenominator:20*(144 a\u00b2 -2880 )=20*144*(a\u00b2 -20 )=2880*(a\u00b2 -20 ).\n\nSo,\n\n[4*(11 a\u00b2 -720 ) ]/[2880*(a\u00b2 -20 ) ]= [ (44 a\u00b2 -2880 ) ]/[2880 a\u00b2 -57600 ].\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (11 a\u00b2 -720 )/(720 a\u00b2 -14400 ).\n\nSo, c\u00b2 [ (11 a\u00b2 -720 )/(720 a\u00b2 -14400 ) ]=1.\n\nThus,\n\nc\u00b2= (720 a\u00b2 -14400 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo,\n\nc\u00b2= [720(a\u00b2 -20 ) ]/[11 a\u00b2 -720 ].\n\nSo,\n\nc\u00b2= [720(a\u00b2 -20 ) ]/[11 a\u00b2 -720 ].\n\nSo, c\u00b2=720(a\u00b2 -20 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nNow, since c\u00b2 must be positive, denominator and numerator must have same sign.\n\nSo,\n\nEither:\n\n1. 720(a\u00b2 -20 )>0 and 11 a\u00b2 -720>0 \u2192 a\u00b2>20 and a\u00b2>720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nOr,\n\n2. 720(a\u00b2 -20 )<0 and 11 a\u00b2 -720<0 \u2192a\u00b2<20 and a\u00b2<720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nBut since a\u00b2 must be \u226520 for the hyperbola, only case 1 is possible: a\u00b2>720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, a\u00b2>65.4545.\n\nSo, c\u00b2=720(a\u00b2 -20 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nNow, BD\u00b2=4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 ).\n\nBut d= -ac/b.\n\nSo, d\u00b2= a\u00b2 c\u00b2 /b\u00b2.\n\nFrom point A: b\u00b2= (6 a\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2= a\u00b2 c\u00b2 / [ (6 a\u00b2)/5 -24 ].\n\nSubstitute c\u00b2:\n\nd\u00b2= a\u00b2 [720(a\u00b2 -20 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ) ] / [ (6 a\u00b2)/5 -24 ].\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n(6 a\u00b2)/5 -24= (6 a\u00b2 -120 )/5.\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2= [ a\u00b2 *720(a\u00b2 -20 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ) ] / [ (6 a\u00b2 -120 )/5 ]= [ a\u00b2 *720(a\u00b2 -20 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ) ] * [5/(6 a\u00b2 -120 ) ].\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [720*5 a\u00b2 (a\u00b2 -20 ) ] / [ (11 a\u00b2 -720 )(6 a\u00b2 -120 ) ].\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:720*5 a\u00b2 (a\u00b2 -20 )=3600 a\u00b2 (a\u00b2 -20 ).\n\nDenominator:(11 a\u00b2 -720 )(6 a\u00b2 -120 )=6(a\u00b2 -20 )*(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2= [3600 a\u00b2 (a\u00b2 -20 ) ]/[6(a\u00b2 -20 )(11 a\u00b2 -720 ) ]= (3600 a\u00b2 )/(6(11 a\u00b2 -720 ))=600 a\u00b2 / (11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2=600 a\u00b2 / (11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 )=4*( c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 ).\n\nFrom earlier, c\u00b2=720(a\u00b2 -20 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo,\n\nc\u00b2 +d\u00b2= [720(a\u00b2 -20 ) +600 a\u00b2 ]/(11 a\u00b2 -720 )= [720 a\u00b2 -14400 +600 a\u00b2 ]/(11 a\u00b2 -720 )= (1320 a\u00b2 -14400 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n1320 a\u00b2 -14400= 120*(11 a\u00b2 -120 ).\n\nSo,\n\nc\u00b2 +d\u00b2=120*(11 a\u00b2 -120 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*120*(11 a\u00b2 -120 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 )=480*(11 a\u00b2 -120 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(11 a\u00b2 -120 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nHmm, so now, BD\u00b2 is expressed as 480*(11 a\u00b2 -120 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11 a\u00b2 -120 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nWe can factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:11 a\u00b2 -120.\n\nDenominator:11 a\u00b2 -720.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor 11 a\u00b2:\n\n=480*(11 a\u00b2 -120 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 )=480*[1 - (600)/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ) ].\n\nWait, let me see:\n\n11 a\u00b2 -120 =11 a\u00b2 -720 +600.\n\nSo,\n\n=480*[ (11 a\u00b2 -720 +600 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ) ]=480*[1 +600/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ) ].\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=480 + (480*600)/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n=480 + 288000/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nNow, since a\u00b2>720/11\u224865.4545, the denominator 11 a\u00b2 -720 is positive.\n\nSo, as a\u00b2 approaches 720/11 from above, denominator approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nAs a\u00b2 approaches infinity, denominator approaches 11 a\u00b2, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480 +288000/(11 a\u00b2 )\u2248480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above as a\u00b2 increases.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, but it's not achieved because as a\u00b2 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut wait, when a\u00b2 approaches infinity, the points A and B go to infinity on the hyperbola, making BD\u00b2 approach 480.\n\nSo, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, the infimum is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nBut wait, earlier in the first approach, I had BD\u00b2 approaching 86.557, but that must have been a mistake.\n\nSo, the correct minimal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut let me check when a\u00b2=720/11, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity, which is consistent with the second approach.\n\nSo, to confirm, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 by choosing a\u00b2 very large.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but wait, no.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 480, but since BD\u00b2 can't be less than 480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480.\n\nWait, but BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, so 480 is the infimum.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\nBut let me compute 480 in terms of the hyperbola.\n\nWait, 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, in the second approach, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as a\u00b2 approaches infinity, so BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired.\n\nTherefore, 480 is the infimum.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nBut wait, in the first approach, when t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/61\u224886.557, which is conflicting.\n\nWait, I think I must have confused the variables in the first approach.\n\nIn the first approach, I expressed BD\u00b2 as 480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut in reality, in the second approach, BD\u00b2=480 +288000/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo, as a\u00b2 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, the correct minimal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, since BD\u00b2 can be as small as approaching 480, the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut wait, no, if BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, then 480 is the infimum, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but 480 is not less than BD\u00b2, it's the infimum.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, it's the maximum lower bound for BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, then 480 is the infimum, and the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nBut wait, no, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480.\n\nWait, no, if BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above, then 480 is the infimum, and any number less than 480 is also less than all BD\u00b2.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest such number, which would be the infimum.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\nBut let me check the calculation again.\n\nFrom BD\u00b2=480 +288000/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nAs a\u00b2 approaches infinity, the term 288000/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ) approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480.\n\nTherefore, the infimum is 480, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but 480 is the infimum, so it's the greatest lower bound.\n\nThus, the answer is 480.\n\nBut let me check with specific values.\n\nLet me choose a\u00b2 very large, say a\u00b2=10000.\n\nThen,\n\nc\u00b2=720(a\u00b2 -20 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 )=720*(99980 )/(110000 -720 )=720*99980/109280\u2248720*(0.9145 )\u2248658.08.\n\nd\u00b2=600 a\u00b2/(11 a\u00b2 -720 )=600*10000/(110000 -720 )\u22486000000/109280\u224855. 6000000/109280\u224855. So, d\u00b2\u224855.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 )=4*(658.08 +55 )\u22484*713.08\u22482852.32.\n\nWait, that's way larger than 480.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake in the expression for BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, earlier I had:\n\nBD\u00b2=480 +288000/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo, when a\u00b2=10000,\n\nBD\u00b2=480 +288000/(110000 -720 )=480 +288000/109280\u2248480 +2.63\u2248482.63.\n\nWhich is close to 480.\n\nBut when I computed c\u00b2 and d\u00b2, I got BD\u00b2\u22482852, which is conflicting.\n\nSo, there must be a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, no, in the expression BD\u00b2=480 +288000/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo, when a\u00b2=10000,\n\nBD\u00b2=480 +288000/(110000 -720 )=480 +288000/109280\u2248480 +2.63\u2248482.63.\n\nBut when I compute c\u00b2 and d\u00b2,\n\nc\u00b2=720*(10000 -20 )/(11*10000 -720 )=720*9980/(110000 -720 )=720*9980/109280.\n\nCompute 720*9980=720*(10000 -20)=7,200,000 -14,400=7,185,600.\n\nDivide by 109280:\n\n7,185,600 /109280\u224865.76.\n\nSimilarly, d\u00b2=600*10000/(11*10000 -720 )=6,000,000/109280\u224854.88.\n\nSo, c\u00b2 +d\u00b2\u224865.76 +54.88\u2248120.64.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 )\u22484*120.64\u2248482.56.\n\nWhich matches the earlier expression.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2\u2248482.56 when a\u00b2=10000.\n\nSo, as a\u00b2 increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, when a\u00b2=1,000,000,\n\nBD\u00b2=480 +288000/(11*1,000,000 -720 )\u2248480 +288000/10,992,800\u2248480 +0.026\u2248480.026.\n\nSo, approaching 480.\n\nTherefore, the infimum is 480.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, that would be 480, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, and 480 is the infimum.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\nBut wait, let me compute 480 in terms of the hyperbola.\n\nWait, the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo, 480 is 24*20.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's a coincidence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward way to see this.\n\nSince BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as the points go to infinity, and BD\u00b2 can't be less than 480, the answer is 480.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{480}.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again.\n\nIt says: Let A, B, C, D be points on the hyperbola (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1 such that ABCD is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nHmm, okay. So, we have a hyperbola, and four points on it forming a rhombus. The diagonals intersect at the origin, which makes sense because for a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so if they intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.\n\nSo, I need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. That is, find the infimum of BD\u00b2, or maybe the minimum possible BD\u00b2? Wait, no. It says the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, it's the supremum of the lower bounds. Hmm, maybe it's the minimal possible BD\u00b2, but not sure yet.\n\nWait, no, the problem is phrased as \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's like the maximum lower bound. So, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is the lower bound, and all BD\u00b2 are greater than or equal to that minimal value. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the minimal BD\u00b2, I think.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think. If all BD\u00b2 are greater than or equal to some number, say m, then m is the greatest lower bound. So, the answer is m, which is the infimum of BD\u00b2. So, we need to find the minimal BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi as described.\n\nSo, to proceed, I need to model the rhombus on the hyperbola.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? No, wait, not necessarily. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square.\n\nWait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square, but wait, actually, no, wait. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's correct. Because a rhombus is a special case of a kite, and in a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular, and since all sides are equal, it's a rhombus. So, yes, the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nSo, in this problem, ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if A is a point on the hyperbola, then C, being the opposite vertex, is the reflection of A across the origin. Similarly, B and D are reflections across the origin.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the four points can be represented as A(a, b), C(-a, -b), B(c, d), D(-c, -d).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal in length. So, the distance from A to B, B to C, C to D, and D to A must all be equal.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use vectors. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and the diagonals are AC and BD. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.\n\nSo, AC is the vector from A to C, which is (-2a, -2b). Similarly, BD is the vector from B to D, which is (-2c, -2d). But wait, no, vectors AC and BD are just from A to C and from B to D, but since the origin is the midpoint, AC is the vector from A to C, which is (-a - a, -b - b) = (-2a, -2b). Similarly, BD is the vector from B to D, which is (-c - c, -d - d) = (-2c, -2d). But wait, no, the vector AC is (C - A), so it's (-a - a, -b - b) = (-2a, -2b). Similarly, BD is (D - B) = (-c - c, -d - d) = (-2c, -2d).\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. So, (-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 0.\n\nWait, that would be (4ac) + (4bd) = 0. So, 4(ac + bd) = 0, which implies ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, that's one condition.\n\nAnother condition is that all sides are equal. So, the length of AB must equal the length of BC, etc.\n\nSo, let's compute the length of AB.\n\nPoint A is (a, b), point B is (c, d). So, AB\u00b2 = (a - c)\u00b2 + (b - d)\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, BC\u00b2 = (c - (-a))\u00b2 + (d - (-b))\u00b2 = (c + a)\u00b2 + (d + b)\u00b2.\n\nSince AB = BC, AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n(a - c)\u00b2 + (b - d)\u00b2 = (a + c)\u00b2 + (b + d)\u00b2.\n\nLet's expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: a\u00b2 - 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2bd + d\u00b2.\n\nRight side: a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2.\n\nSet them equal:\n\na\u00b2 - 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2bd + d\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2.\n\nSubtract a\u00b2, c\u00b2, b\u00b2, d\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n-2ac - 2bd = 2ac + 2bd.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n-2ac - 2bd - 2ac - 2bd = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-4ac -4bd = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by -4:\n\nac + bd = 0.\n\nWait, that's the same condition as before. So, the perpendicularity of the diagonals and the equality of sides lead to the same condition, ac + bd = 0. So, that's one equation.\n\nBut we also have the condition that all four points lie on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, A(a, b) is on the hyperbola, so (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, B(c, d) is on the hyperbola, so (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\n2. (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nAnd another equation:\n\n3. ac + bd = 0.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2. BD is the diagonal from B to D, so BD is the distance from B(c, d) to D(-c, -d).\n\nWait, no, BD is the diagonal from B to D, but since diagonals intersect at the origin, BD is the line from B to D, which is from (c, d) to (-c, -d). So, the length of BD is the distance between these two points.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (c - (-c))\u00b2 + (d - (-d))\u00b2 = (2c)\u00b2 + (2d)\u00b2 = 4c\u00b2 + 4d\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, AC is the diagonal from A(a, b) to C(-a, -b), so AC\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2).\n\nBut we are interested in BD\u00b2, so 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, we need to find BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), and find the minimal BD\u00b2, or perhaps the maximum lower bound.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. So, the minimal possible value of BD\u00b2, which is the greatest lower bound.\n\nSo, to find the minimal BD\u00b2, given that A and B lie on the hyperbola and ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, let's see. We have variables a, b, c, d with the conditions above.\n\nWe can think of this as a system of equations. Let me list them:\n\n1. (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\n2. (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\n3. ac + bd = 0.\n\nWe have four variables, but three equations. So, we can perhaps express some variables in terms of others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can parameterize points on the hyperbola.\n\nI know that hyperbola can be parameterized using hyperbolic functions, but maybe it's better to use a parametric form.\n\nAlternatively, for hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, a parametrization can be (a sec \u03b8, b tan \u03b8). Or sometimes (a cosh t, b sinh t), but that's for the right hyperbola.\n\nWait, but perhaps using the standard parametrization for hyperbola. Let's consider that.\n\nSo, for hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, we can parametrize points as (sqrt(20) sec \u03b8, sqrt(24) tan \u03b8). Alternatively, (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates (x, y) such that x = sqrt(20) sec \u03b8, y = sqrt(24) tan \u03b8.\n\nBut let me think: perhaps I can let point A be (sqrt(20) sec \u03b8, sqrt(24) tan \u03b8), and then point B is (sqrt(20) sec \u03c6, sqrt(24) tan \u03c6). Then, using the condition ac + bd = 0, which relates \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nWait, but I don't know if this is the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can express c and d in terms of a and b.\n\nFrom condition 3, ac + bd =0, so c = (-bd)/a, assuming a \u2260 0.\n\nBut then, substituting into equation 2: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nSo, substituting c = (-bd)/a into equation 2:\n\n[ ( (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2 ) ] /20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2) - d\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nFactor d\u00b2:\n\nd\u00b2 [ (b\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2) - 1/24 ] =1.\n\nSo, d\u00b2 = 1 / [ (b\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2) - 1/24 ].\n\nHmm, but this seems a bit complicated.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can use the hyperbola equations to relate a, b, c, d.\n\nFrom equation 1: (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nLet me solve for b\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 = (a\u00b2)/20 * 24 - 24*1.\n\nWait, no, rearranged:\n\n(a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1 \u2192 (b\u00b2)/24 = (a\u00b2)/20 -1 \u2192 b\u00b2=24*(a\u00b2/20 -1).\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1 \u2192 d\u00b2=24*(c\u00b2/20 -1).\n\nSo, substituting into equation 3: ac + bd =0.\n\nSo, c = (-bd)/a.\n\nSo, c = (-b d)/a.\n\nSo, let's square both sides: c\u00b2 = (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2.\n\nBut from equation 2: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1 \u2192 c\u00b2 = 20*(1 + (d\u00b2)/24).\n\nSo, substituting c\u00b2 into c\u00b2 = (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2:\n\n20*(1 + (d\u00b2)/24) = (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n20 + (20 d\u00b2)/24 = (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2.\n\nSimplify 20/24 to 5/6:\n\n20 + (5 d\u00b2)/6 = (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 6 to eliminate denominators:\n\n120 + 5 d\u00b2 = (6 b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2.\n\nNow, from equation 1, we have b\u00b2 =24*(a\u00b2/20 -1) = (24 a\u00b2)/20 -24 = (6 a\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, substituting b\u00b2 into the equation:\n\n120 +5 d\u00b2 = [6*( (6 a\u00b2/5 -24 ) d\u00b2 ) ] / a\u00b2.\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n6*(6 a\u00b2/5 -24) = (36 a\u00b2)/5 -144.\n\nSo, putting back:\n\n120 +5 d\u00b2 = [ (36 a\u00b2 /5 -144 ) d\u00b2 ] / a\u00b2.\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n(36 a\u00b2 /5 -144 ) / a\u00b2 = 36/5 - 144 / a\u00b2.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n120 +5 d\u00b2 = (36/5 - 144 / a\u00b2 ) d\u00b2.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n120 +5 d\u00b2 - (36/5) d\u00b2 + (144 / a\u00b2 ) d\u00b2 =0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n120 + [5 - 36/5 + 144/(a\u00b2)] d\u00b2 =0.\n\nCompute 5 - 36/5 = (25 -36)/5 = (-11)/5.\n\nSo,\n\n120 + [ (-11/5) + (144 / a\u00b2) ] d\u00b2 =0.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n[ (144 / a\u00b2) - (11/5) ] d\u00b2 +120=0.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should express d\u00b2 in terms of a\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of a single variable.\n\nWait, let's see. We have:\n\nFrom equation 1: b\u00b2 = (6 a\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nFrom equation 3: c = (-b d)/a.\n\nFrom equation 2: d\u00b2 =24*(c\u00b2/20 -1).\n\nSo, let's substitute c into equation 2.\n\nc = (-b d)/a \u2192 c\u00b2 = (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2.\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes:\n\nd\u00b2 =24*( (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2 ) -1 ).\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2 =24*( (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2 ) -1 ).\n\nLet's rearrange:\n\nd\u00b2 +24*( (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2 ) ) =24.\n\nFactor d\u00b2:\n\nd\u00b2 [1 + (24 b\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2) ] =24.\n\nSimplify 24/20 to 6/5:\n\nd\u00b2 [1 + (6 b\u00b2)/(5 a\u00b2) ] =24.\n\nFrom equation 1, b\u00b2 = (6 a\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, substitute that into the expression:\n\nd\u00b2 [1 + (6*(6 a\u00b2/5 -24 ))/(5 a\u00b2) ] =24.\n\nCompute the term inside the brackets:\n\nFirst, compute 6*(6 a\u00b2/5 -24 ) = (36 a\u00b2)/5 -144.\n\nSo, the term becomes:\n\n1 + (36 a\u00b2/5 -144 )/(5 a\u00b2).\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n(36 a\u00b2/5 -144 )/(5 a\u00b2 ) = (36/25) - (144)/(5 a\u00b2).\n\nSo, the entire expression inside the brackets is:\n\n1 + (36/25) - (144)/(5 a\u00b2) = (25/25 +36/25) - (144)/(5 a\u00b2) = (61/25) - (144)/(5 a\u00b2).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nd\u00b2 [61/25 - 144/(5 a\u00b2) ] =24.\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2 =24 / [61/25 - 144/(5 a\u00b2) ].\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy, but perhaps manageable.\n\nSo, now, let's express BD\u00b2 in terms of a\u00b2.\n\nBD\u00b2 =4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2).\n\nBut c\u00b2 = (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2, from equation 3.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 =4*( (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 ) =4 d\u00b2 ( (b\u00b2)/a\u00b2 +1 ).\n\nFrom equation 1, b\u00b2 = (6 a\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo,\n\n(b\u00b2)/a\u00b2 = (6/5) -24/a\u00b2.\n\nThus,\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 d\u00b2 [ (6/5 -24/a\u00b2 ) +1 ] =4 d\u00b2 [11/5 -24/a\u00b2 ].\n\nBut from earlier, we have:\n\nd\u00b2 =24 / [61/25 - 144/(5 a\u00b2) ].\n\nSo, let's substitute that into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 * [24 / (61/25 -144/(5 a\u00b2)) ] * [11/5 -24/a\u00b2 ].\n\nThis is getting really complicated, but let's try to simplify step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute the denominator in the d\u00b2 expression:\n\n61/25 -144/(5 a\u00b2) = (61 a\u00b2 -144*5 )/(25 a\u00b2 )= (61 a\u00b2 -720 )/(25 a\u00b2 ).\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2 =24 / [ (61 a\u00b2 -720 )/(25 a\u00b2 ) ] =24 * (25 a\u00b2 )/(61 a\u00b2 -720 )= (600 a\u00b2 )/(61 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSimilarly, the term [11/5 -24/a\u00b2 ] can be written as (11 a\u00b2 -120 )/(5 a\u00b2 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 becomes:\n\n4 * (600 a\u00b2 )/(61 a\u00b2 -720 ) * (11 a\u00b2 -120 )/(5 a\u00b2 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n4 * (600 a\u00b2 * (11 a\u00b2 -120 )) / [ (61 a\u00b2 -720 ) *5 a\u00b2 ].\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:4 *600 a\u00b2 (11 a\u00b2 -120 ) =2400 a\u00b2 (11 a\u00b2 -120 ).\n\nDenominator:5 a\u00b2 (61 a\u00b2 -720 )=5 a\u00b2 (61 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = [2400 a\u00b2 (11 a\u00b2 -120 ) ] / [5 a\u00b2 (61 a\u00b2 -720 ) ].\n\nCancel a\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 = [2400 (11 a\u00b2 -120 ) ] / [5 (61 a\u00b2 -720 ) ].\n\nSimplify 2400 /5 =480:\n\nBD\u00b2 =480 (11 a\u00b2 -120 ) / (61 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =480*(11 a\u00b2 -120)/(61 a\u00b2 -720).\n\nHmm, that's a function of a\u00b2. Let me denote t = a\u00b2. Then,\n\nBD\u00b2 =480*(11 t -120)/(61 t -720).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 =480*(11t -120)/(61 t -720).\n\nNow, we can simplify this expression:\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 11t -120.\n\nDenominator:61 t -720.\n\nHmm, let me see if I can write this as a constant plus something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps perform polynomial division.\n\nDivide 11t -120 by 61t -720.\n\nLet me write 11t -120 = (11/61)(61 t -720) + remainder.\n\nCompute (11/61)(61 t -720 )=11 t - (11*720)/61=11 t - 7920/61.\n\nSubtract this from numerator:\n\n(11t -120) - (11t -7920/61 )= -120 +7920/61= (-120*61 +7920)/61= (-7320 +7920)/61=600/61.\n\nSo,\n\n11t -120 = (11/61)(61t -720) +600/61.\n\nSo,\n\n(11t -120)/(61 t -720 )=11/61 + (600/61)/(61t -720).\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11/61 + (600/61)/(61t -720 ))=480*(11/61) +480*(600/61)/(61t -720 ).\n\nCompute 480*(11/61)= (480*11)/61=5280/61\u224886.557.\n\nAnd 480*(600/61)=288000/61\u22484721.311.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2\u224886.557 + (4721.311)/(61t -720).\n\nHmm, so as t increases, the second term tends to zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches approximately 86.557.\n\nBut we need to find the minimal BD\u00b2, which would occur when the second term is as negative as possible, but we need to ensure that the denominator (61t -720) is positive because otherwise, the fraction would be negative, which would make BD\u00b2 smaller.\n\nWait, but t is a\u00b2, and since A is on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1, a\u00b2 must be \u226520, because x\u00b2/20 \u22651 \u2192x\u00b2\u226520.\n\nSo, t = a\u00b2 \u226520.\n\nSo, 61t -720 =61*(a\u00b2) -720. Let's compute when 61t -720 is positive or negative.\n\n61t -720 \u22650 \u2192 t\u2265720/61\u224811.803.\n\nBut t is already \u226520, so 61t -720 is positive for t\u226520.\n\nSo, the denominator is positive, and the numerator of the second term is positive, so the entire fraction is positive, so BD\u00b2 is larger than 5280/61\u224886.557.\n\nWait, but that's the minimal value, right? Because as t increases, the second term decreases, so BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/61 from above.\n\nWait, but 5280 divided by 61 is approximately 86.557, but let me compute it exactly.\n\n61*86=5246, 61*86=5246, 5280-5246=34, so 5280/61=86 +34/61=86.557.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=5280/61 + (288000/61)/(61t -720 ).\n\nSince 61t -720 is positive, and as t increases, the second term becomes smaller, so BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/61\u224886.557 from above. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 5280/61, but is this achievable?\n\nWait, when t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/61. So, 5280/61 is the infimum, but it's not achieved because as t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches it asymptotically.\n\nBut wait, let me check if t can be exactly 720/61\u224811.803, but t is a\u00b2 which is at least 20, so t is always greater than 20.\n\nWait, so 61t -720 is always positive, as t\u226520. So, the second term is positive, so BD\u00b2 is always greater than 5280/61.\n\nSo, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 5280/61, which is approximately 86.557.\n\nBut wait, 5280 divided by 61: let me compute 61*86=5246, 61*87=5246+61=5307. So, 5280 is between 86 and 87.\n\n5280-5246=34, so 5280/61=86 +34/61=86.557...\n\nSo, 5280/61 is the minimal value, but is it attainable? Since t can't be less than 20, and as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/61.\n\nWait, but if t approaches 20 from above, then 61t approaches 61*20=1220, so 61t -720 approaches 1220 -720=500.\n\nSo, the second term becomes (288000/61)/500= (288000)/(61*500)=288000/30500\u22489.442.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2\u224886.557 +9.442\u224896 when t is 20.\n\nAs t increases, the second term decreases, so BD\u00b2 decreases towards 86.557.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 5280/61, but is it attainable?\n\nWait, if t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/61, but for finite t, it's always larger.\n\nSo, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is 5280/61, but it's not achieved by any finite rhombus.\n\nBut the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum, which is 5280/61.\n\nBut let me check if 5280/61 is correct.\n\nWait, let me compute 61*86=5246, 61*86=5246, 5280-5246=34, so 5280=61*86 +34.\n\nSo, 5280/61=86 +34/61=86.557.\n\nBut wait, let me see if this is indeed the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the expression for BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, let's double-check.\n\nWe had BD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nLet me see if I can simplify this fraction.\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator:11t -120.\n\nDenominator:61t -720.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor out 11 and 61:\n\nBut 11 and 61 are primes, so not much to factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps write numerator as 11t -120 =11(t) -120.\n\nDenominator:61 t -720=61(t) -720.\n\nHmm, not much help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that 11t -120 and 61t -720 can be expressed in terms of each other.\n\nWait, 61t -720 = (61/11)*(11t) -720.\n\nBut 61/11 is approximately 5.545, which is messy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express as:\n\nLet me write BD\u00b2 as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720)=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nLet me divide numerator and denominator by t:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11 -120/t)/(61 -720/t).\n\nAs t approaches infinity, this tends to 480*(11)/61= (480*11)/61=5280/61\u224886.557.\n\nSo, as t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/61.\n\nSince t cannot be less than 20, but can be as large as possible, so the infimum is 5280/61.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 5280/61.\n\nBut let me compute 5280 divided by 61.\n\nCompute 61*80=4880, 5280-4880=400.\n\n61*6=366, 400-366=34.\n\nSo, 61*86=61*(80+6)=4880+366=5246.\n\n5280-5246=34.\n\nSo, 5280/61=86 +34/61=86.557...\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 5280/61, which is approximately 86.557.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 5280/61.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this is indeed the minimal value.\n\nWait, another approach: since BD\u00b2 =4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2), and points B and D are on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, for point B(c, d), we have c\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo, c\u00b2=20(1 +d\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2)=4[20(1 +d\u00b2/24) +d\u00b2 ]=4[20 + (20 d\u00b2)/24 +d\u00b2 ]=4[20 + (5 d\u00b2)/6 +d\u00b2 ]=4[20 + (11 d\u00b2)/6 ].\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=80 + (44 d\u00b2)/6=80 + (22 d\u00b2)/3.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3)d\u00b2.\n\nHmm, but we also have the condition ac + bd=0.\n\nBut since A(a, b) is on the hyperbola, a\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo, maybe we can express d in terms of a, or something.\n\nWait, but this seems a different approach. Let me see.\n\nWait, from BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3)d\u00b2.\n\nSo, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize d\u00b2.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when d\u00b2 is as small as possible.\n\nSo, what's the minimal possible d\u00b2 for point B(c, d) on the hyperbola?\n\nBut d can't be zero because then point B would be on the x-axis, but then point D would be (-c, -d)=(-c, 0), which would make BD a horizontal line, but then the diagonals AC and BD would need to be perpendicular.\n\nBut wait, if d=0, then BD would be horizontal, and AC would need to be vertical to be perpendicular. But AC is from (a,b) to (-a, -b), so unless b=0, which would make AC horizontal, but then if AC is horizontal and BD is horizontal, they can't be perpendicular unless both are zero, which is not possible.\n\nSo, d can't be zero. So, d must satisfy some condition.\n\nWait, but the minimal d\u00b2 occurs when point B is as close as possible to the origin on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1.\n\nThe minimal y\u00b2 occurs when x is as small as possible, which is x\u00b2=20, so y\u00b2=24*(x\u00b2/20 -1)=24*(1 -1)=0. But that's the vertex. But as we saw, d can't be zero because of the rhombus condition.\n\nWait, but if d approaches zero, then BD\u00b2 approaches 80 +0=80.\n\nBut from earlier approach, the minimal BD\u00b2 was 5280/61\u224886.557, which is higher than 80.\n\nSo, there must be a contradiction. So, perhaps my earlier approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 isn't 5280/61, but higher.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nIf BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3)d\u00b2, then to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize d\u00b2.\n\nBut point B(c, d) is on hyperbola, so c\u00b2=20(1 +d\u00b2/24).\n\nBut from the condition ac + bd=0.\n\nFrom this, c= (-b d)/a.\n\nSo, substituting c into c\u00b2=20(1 +d\u00b2/24):\n\n[ (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2 ]=20(1 +d\u00b2/24 ).\n\nSo,\n\n(b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2=20 + (20 d\u00b2)/24=20 + (5 d\u00b2)/6.\n\nFrom equation 1, a\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24=1 \u2192 b\u00b2=24(a\u00b2/20 -1)= (6 a\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, substituting b\u00b2 into the equation:\n\n[ ( (6 a\u00b2/5 -24 ) d\u00b2 ) /a\u00b2 ]=20 + (5 d\u00b2)/6.\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n(6 a\u00b2/5 -24 ) d\u00b2 /a\u00b2 = (6/5 -24/a\u00b2 ) d\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n(6/5 -24/a\u00b2 ) d\u00b2 =20 + (5 d\u00b2)/6.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n(6/5 -24/a\u00b2 ) d\u00b2 - (5 d\u00b2)/6 -20=0.\n\nFactor d\u00b2:\n\nd\u00b2 [6/5 -24/a\u00b2 -5/6 ] -20=0.\n\nCompute the coefficient:\n\n6/5 -5/6 = (36 -25)/30=11/30.\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2 [11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ] -20=0.\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2 [11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ] =20.\n\nThus,\n\nd\u00b2=20 / [11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ].\n\nHmm, so we have d\u00b2=20 / [11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ].\n\nNow, since d\u00b2 must be positive, the denominator must be positive.\n\nSo,\n\n11/30 -24/a\u00b2 >0 \u219224/a\u00b2 <11/30 \u2192a\u00b2>24*(30)/11=720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 must be greater than 720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, the minimal a\u00b2 is 720/11, but since a\u00b2 must be \u226520, and 720/11\u224865.45>20, so the minimal a\u00b2 is 720/11.\n\nWait, but if a\u00b2>720/11, then d\u00b2 is positive.\n\nSo, the minimal a\u00b2 is 720/11, which gives the maximal d\u00b2?\n\nWait, no, if a\u00b2 approaches 720/11 from above, then the denominator approaches zero, so d\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, no, if a\u00b2 approaches 720/11 from above, then 24/a\u00b2 approaches 24/(720/11)= (24*11)/720=264/720=11/30.\n\nSo, denominator 11/30 -24/a\u00b2 approaches 11/30 -11/30=0.\n\nSo, d\u00b2 approaches 20 /0 \u2192 infinity.\n\nWait, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, but perhaps when a\u00b2 is larger, the denominator becomes positive?\n\nWait, no, wait, 11/30 -24/a\u00b2.\n\nIf a\u00b2 is large, 24/a\u00b2 approaches zero, so denominator approaches 11/30, which is positive.\n\nSo, for a\u00b2>720/11\u224865.4545, the denominator is positive, so d\u00b2 is positive.\n\nSo, when a\u00b2 approaches 720/11 from above, d\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWhen a\u00b2 approaches infinity, d\u00b2 approaches 20/(11/30)=20*(30/11)=600/11\u224854.545.\n\nSo, d\u00b2 is between 600/11\u224854.545 and infinity.\n\nSo, the minimal d\u00b2 is 600/11, achieved as a\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3) d\u00b2.\n\nSo, minimal BD\u00b2 is when d\u00b2 is minimal, which is 600/11.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=80 + (22/3)*(600/11)=80 + (22*600)/(3*11)=80 + (13200)/(33)=80 +400=480.\n\nWait, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as a\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the earlier result where BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/61\u224886.557.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach.\n\nWait, in this approach, BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3) d\u00b2, and d\u00b2=20 / [11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ].\n\nSo, as a\u00b2 approaches infinity, d\u00b2 approaches 20/(11/30)=600/11\u224854.545.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 80 + (22/3)*(600/11)=80 + (22*600)/(33)=80 + (13200/33)=80 +400=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as a\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut earlier, when I expressed BD\u00b2 in terms of t=a\u00b2, I got BD\u00b2 approaching 5280/61\u224886.557 as t approaches infinity.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nHmm, seems like a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach when I expressed BD\u00b2 in terms of t.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut when t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480*(11t)/(61t)=480*(11/61)=5280/61\u224886.557.\n\nBut in the second approach, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, clearly, I have a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, perhaps in the first approach, when I expressed BD\u00b2=4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2), but from the second approach, BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3)d\u00b2.\n\nSo, let me compute 4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2) and see if it equals 80 + (22/3)d\u00b2.\n\nFrom equation 2, c\u00b2=20(1 +d\u00b2/24).\n\nSo,\n\n4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2)=4[20(1 +d\u00b2/24) +d\u00b2 ]=4[20 + (20 d\u00b2)/24 +d\u00b2 ]=4[20 + (5 d\u00b2)/6 +d\u00b2 ]=4[20 + (11 d\u00b2)/6 ]=80 + (44 d\u00b2)/6=80 + (22 d\u00b2)/3.\n\nYes, so BD\u00b2=80 + (22 d\u00b2)/3.\n\nSo, the second approach is correct.\n\nBut in the first approach, I had BD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut if t approaches infinity, this approaches 480*11/61\u224886.557, which conflicts with the second approach's conclusion that BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach when I substituted variables.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nIn the first approach, I had:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut from the second approach, as a\u00b2 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, perhaps the first approach is wrong.\n\nWait, let me check the first approach again.\n\nIn the first approach, I had:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut in reality, from the second approach, as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, so the first approach's conclusion that BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/61 must be wrong.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach.\n\nWait, let's check.\n\nIn the first approach, I had:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut in reality, as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480*(11/61)*t / (61/61 t )=480*(11/61)/1=480*(11/61)=5280/61\u224886.557.\n\nBut in the second approach, as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, this inconsistency suggests that one of the approaches is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parametrization in the first approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution steps.\n\nLet me check the first approach:\n\nWe had:\n\nBD\u00b2=4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2).\n\nBut c= (-b d)/a.\n\nSo,\n\nc\u00b2= (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2.\n\nFrom equation 2, c\u00b2=20(1 +d\u00b2/24).\n\nSo,\n\n(b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2=20(1 +d\u00b2/24).\n\nFrom equation 1, b\u00b2= (6 a\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n[ (6 a\u00b2/5 -24 ) d\u00b2 ] /a\u00b2=20(1 +d\u00b2/24 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n(6/5 -24/a\u00b2 ) d\u00b2=20 + (5 d\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo,\n\n(6/5 -24/a\u00b2 ) d\u00b2 - (5 d\u00b2)/6 =20.\n\nFactor d\u00b2:\n\nd\u00b2 [6/5 -24/a\u00b2 -5/6 ]=20.\n\nCompute 6/5 -5/6= (36 -25)/30=11/30.\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2 [11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ]=20.\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2=20 / [11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ].\n\nWhich is consistent with the second approach.\n\nSo, in the first approach, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I had:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut from the second approach, BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3) d\u00b2=80 + (22/3)*(20 / [11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ]).\n\nSo, perhaps in the first approach, I had an error in substituting expressions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach when expressing BD\u00b2 in terms of t.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed with the second approach, which seems more straightforward.\n\nSo, in the second approach, we have:\n\nBD\u00b2=80 + (22/3) d\u00b2.\n\nAnd d\u00b2=20 / [11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ].\n\nBut a\u00b2 must be greater than 720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, as a\u00b2 approaches infinity, d\u00b2 approaches 20/(11/30)=600/11\u224854.545.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 80 + (22/3)*(600/11)=80 + (22*600)/(3*11)=80 + (13200)/33=80 +400=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as a\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but that seems to suggest that BD\u00b2 can approach 480, but can't go below that.\n\nBut wait, no, because as a\u00b2 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as a\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut when a\u00b2 increases, d\u00b2 approaches 600/11\u224854.545, so BD\u00b2 approaches 80 + (22/3)*(54.545)=80 + (22/3)*54.545.\n\nCompute 54.545*(22/3)= (54.545*22)/3\u2248(1200)/3=400.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 80 +400=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as a\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut when a\u00b2 is minimal, which is a\u00b2=720/11\u224865.4545, then d\u00b2=20/[11/30 -24/(720/11)]=20/[11/30 - (24*11)/720 ].\n\nCompute 24*11=264, 264/720=11/30.\n\nSo, denominator=11/30 -11/30=0.\n\nSo, d\u00b2 approaches infinity as a\u00b2 approaches 720/11 from above.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity as a\u00b2 approaches 720/11 from above.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the earlier conclusion.\n\nSo, as a\u00b2 increases from 720/11 to infinity, d\u00b2 decreases from infinity to 600/11, so BD\u00b2 decreases from infinity to 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, but the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, approached as a\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut wait, that seems to suggest that the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut earlier, in the first approach, I thought the minimal BD\u00b2 was 5280/61\u224886.557.\n\nBut according to the second approach, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach.\n\nWait, let me check the first approach again.\n\nIn the first approach, I expressed BD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut with t=a\u00b2, which is greater than 720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, let's compute BD\u00b2 when t=720/11.\n\nCompute numerator:11t -120=11*(720/11) -120=720 -120=600.\n\nDenominator:61t -720=61*(720/11) -720= (61*720 -720*11)/11=720*(61 -11)/11=720*50/11=36000/11.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(600)/(36000/11)=480*(600*11)/36000=480*(6600)/36000=480*(11/60)= (480/60)*11=8*11=88.\n\nWait, that's 88.\n\nWait, so when t=720/11\u224865.4545, BD\u00b2=88.\n\nBut earlier, when a\u00b2 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, that suggests that BD\u00b2 can vary from 88 to 480.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 88, and the maximal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the second approach.\n\nWait, but in the second approach, we saw that when a\u00b2 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, and when a\u00b2 approaches 720/11 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut in the first approach, when t=720/11, BD\u00b2=88.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute d\u00b2 when t=720/11.\n\nFrom d\u00b2=20/[11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ].\n\na\u00b2=720/11.\n\nSo, 24/a\u00b2=24/(720/11)= (24*11)/720=264/720=11/30.\n\nSo, denominator=11/30 -11/30=0.\n\nSo, d\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nBut in the first approach, BD\u00b2=88 when t=720/11.\n\nSo, how come?\n\nWait, maybe in the first approach, when t=720/11, BD\u00b2=88, but in reality, d\u00b2 is infinity, which would make BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3)*d\u00b2 also approach infinity.\n\nSo, there must be a mistake in the first approach.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I had BD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut when t=720/11, BD\u00b2=480*(600)/(36000/11)=480*(600*11)/36000=480*(6600)/36000=480*(11/60)=88.\n\nBut according to the second approach, BD\u00b2 should approach infinity as t approaches 720/11 from above.\n\nSo, this suggests that the first approach is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in the first approach.\n\nWait, perhaps when I expressed BD\u00b2 in terms of t, I substituted incorrectly.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nIn the first approach, I had:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut when t=720/11, BD\u00b2=480*(11*(720/11) -120)/(61*(720/11) -720)=480*(720 -120)/( (61*720)/11 -720 ).\n\nCompute numerator:720 -120=600.\n\nDenominator: (61*720 -720*11)/11=720*(61 -11)/11=720*50/11=36000/11.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(600)/(36000/11)=480*600*11/36000=480*6600/36000=480*(11/60)=88.\n\nBut in reality, when a\u00b2=720/11, d\u00b2 approaches infinity, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, the first approach must have a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression for BD\u00b2 in terms of t is incorrect.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I had:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut according to the second approach, BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3) d\u00b2.\n\nAnd d\u00b2=20/[11/30 -24/a\u00b2 ].\n\nSo, when t=720/11, a\u00b2=720/11, so d\u00b2 is undefined, as denominator approaches zero.\n\nBut in the first approach, BD\u00b2=88 when t=720/11, but in reality, BD\u00b2 should approach infinity.\n\nSo, the first approach is wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps the mistake is in the first approach's substitution.\n\nWait, in the first approach, after a lot of substitutions, I arrived at BD\u00b2=480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut perhaps this is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in expressing BD\u00b2 in terms of t.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct minimal BD\u00b2 is 88, achieved when a\u00b2=720/11.\n\nBut when a\u00b2=720/11, d\u00b2 approaches infinity, which contradicts.\n\nSo, I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think geometrically.\n\nGiven that the diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular and intersect at the origin, and all four points lie on the hyperbola.\n\nThe diagonals are AC and BD, with midpoints at the origin.\n\nSo, AC is a diagonal from A(a, b) to C(-a, -b), so AC has length 2\u221a(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, BD is from B(c, d) to D(-c, -d), so BD has length 2\u221a(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2).\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the dot product of vectors AC and BD is zero.\n\nSo, (a, b)\u00b7(c, d)=ac + bd=0.\n\nSo, points A and B are such that ac + bd=0.\n\nMoreover, both A and B lie on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal possible BD\u00b2=4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2), given that ac + bd=0, and a\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24=1, c\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo, we can think of this as an optimization problem: minimize BD\u00b2=4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2) subject to the constraints ac + bd=0, a\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24=1, c\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24=1.\n\nThis can be approached using Lagrange multipliers, but it might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps parameterize points A and B.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nSince ac + bd=0, we can write d= - (ac)/b, provided b\u22600.\n\nBut since points are on hyperbola, b can't be zero because then a\u00b2=20, and d would be zero, which is not allowed as before.\n\nSo, substituting d= - (ac)/b into equation for point B.\n\nPoint B(c, d) is on hyperbola, so c\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo,\n\nc\u00b2/20 - (a\u00b2 c\u00b2)/(24 b\u00b2 )=1.\n\nFactor c\u00b2:\n\nc\u00b2 [1/20 - a\u00b2/(24 b\u00b2 ) ]=1.\n\nFrom equation for point A: a\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24=1 \u2192 b\u00b2=24(a\u00b2/20 -1)= (6 a\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, substitute b\u00b2 into the expression:\n\nc\u00b2 [1/20 - a\u00b2/(24*(6 a\u00b2/5 -24 )) ]=1.\n\nSimplify the term inside the brackets:\n\nCompute denominator:24*(6 a\u00b2/5 -24 )= (144 a\u00b2)/5 -576.\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2/( (144 a\u00b2)/5 -576 )= (5 a\u00b2)/(144 a\u00b2 -2880 ).\n\nSo,\n\n1/20 - (5 a\u00b2)/(144 a\u00b2 -2880 )= [ (144 a\u00b2 -2880 ) -100 a\u00b2 ] / [20*(144 a\u00b2 -2880 ) ].\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n144 a\u00b2 -2880 -100 a\u00b2=44 a\u00b2 -2880.\n\nSo,\n\n[44 a\u00b2 -2880 ] / [20*(144 a\u00b2 -2880 ) ].\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:4*(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nDenominator:20*(144 a\u00b2 -2880 )=20*144*(a\u00b2 -20 )=2880*(a\u00b2 -20 ).\n\nSo,\n\n[4*(11 a\u00b2 -720 ) ]/[2880*(a\u00b2 -20 ) ]= [ (44 a\u00b2 -2880 ) ]/[2880 a\u00b2 -57600 ].\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (11 a\u00b2 -720 )/(720 a\u00b2 -14400 ).\n\nSo, c\u00b2 [ (11 a\u00b2 -720 )/(720 a\u00b2 -14400 ) ]=1.\n\nThus,\n\nc\u00b2= (720 a\u00b2 -14400 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo,\n\nc\u00b2= [720(a\u00b2 -20 ) ]/[11 a\u00b2 -720 ].\n\nSo,\n\nc\u00b2= [720(a\u00b2 -20 ) ]/[11 a\u00b2 -720 ].\n\nSo, c\u00b2=720(a\u00b2 -20 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nNow, since c\u00b2 must be positive, denominator and numerator must have same sign.\n\nSo,\n\nEither:\n\n1. 720(a\u00b2 -20 )>0 and 11 a\u00b2 -720>0 \u2192 a\u00b2>20 and a\u00b2>720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nOr,\n\n2. 720(a\u00b2 -20 )<0 and 11 a\u00b2 -720<0 \u2192a\u00b2<20 and a\u00b2<720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nBut since a\u00b2 must be \u226520 for the hyperbola, only case 1 is possible: a\u00b2>720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, a\u00b2>65.4545.\n\nSo, c\u00b2=720(a\u00b2 -20 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nNow, BD\u00b2=4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 ).\n\nBut d= -ac/b.\n\nSo, d\u00b2= a\u00b2 c\u00b2 /b\u00b2.\n\nFrom point A: b\u00b2= (6 a\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2= a\u00b2 c\u00b2 / [ (6 a\u00b2)/5 -24 ].\n\nSubstitute c\u00b2:\n\nd\u00b2= a\u00b2 [720(a\u00b2 -20 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ) ] / [ (6 a\u00b2)/5 -24 ].\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n(6 a\u00b2)/5 -24= (6 a\u00b2 -120 )/5.\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2= [ a\u00b2 *720(a\u00b2 -20 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ) ] / [ (6 a\u00b2 -120 )/5 ]= [ a\u00b2 *720(a\u00b2 -20 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ) ] * [5/(6 a\u00b2 -120 ) ].\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [720*5 a\u00b2 (a\u00b2 -20 ) ] / [ (11 a\u00b2 -720 )(6 a\u00b2 -120 ) ].\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:720*5 a\u00b2 (a\u00b2 -20 )=3600 a\u00b2 (a\u00b2 -20 ).\n\nDenominator:(11 a\u00b2 -720 )(6 a\u00b2 -120 )=6(a\u00b2 -20 )*(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2= [3600 a\u00b2 (a\u00b2 -20 ) ]/[6(a\u00b2 -20 )(11 a\u00b2 -720 ) ]= (3600 a\u00b2 )/(6(11 a\u00b2 -720 ))=600 a\u00b2 / (11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2=600 a\u00b2 / (11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 )=4*( c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 ).\n\nFrom earlier, c\u00b2=720(a\u00b2 -20 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo,\n\nc\u00b2 +d\u00b2= [720(a\u00b2 -20 ) +600 a\u00b2 ]/(11 a\u00b2 -720 )= [720 a\u00b2 -14400 +600 a\u00b2 ]/(11 a\u00b2 -720 )= (1320 a\u00b2 -14400 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n1320 a\u00b2 -14400= 120*(11 a\u00b2 -120 ).\n\nSo,\n\nc\u00b2 +d\u00b2=120*(11 a\u00b2 -120 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*120*(11 a\u00b2 -120 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 )=480*(11 a\u00b2 -120 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(11 a\u00b2 -120 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nHmm, so now, BD\u00b2 is expressed as 480*(11 a\u00b2 -120 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11 a\u00b2 -120 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nWe can factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:11 a\u00b2 -120.\n\nDenominator:11 a\u00b2 -720.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor 11 a\u00b2:\n\n=480*(11 a\u00b2 -120 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 )=480*[1 - (600)/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ) ].\n\nWait, let me see:\n\n11 a\u00b2 -120 =11 a\u00b2 -720 +600.\n\nSo,\n\n=480*[ (11 a\u00b2 -720 +600 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ) ]=480*[1 +600/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ) ].\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=480 + (480*600)/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n=480 + 288000/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nNow, since a\u00b2>720/11\u224865.4545, the denominator 11 a\u00b2 -720 is positive.\n\nSo, as a\u00b2 approaches 720/11 from above, denominator approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nAs a\u00b2 approaches infinity, denominator approaches 11 a\u00b2, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480 +288000/(11 a\u00b2 )\u2248480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above as a\u00b2 increases.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, but it's not achieved because as a\u00b2 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut wait, when a\u00b2 approaches infinity, the points A and B go to infinity on the hyperbola, making BD\u00b2 approach 480.\n\nSo, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, the infimum is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nBut wait, earlier in the first approach, I had BD\u00b2 approaching 86.557, but that must have been a mistake.\n\nSo, the correct minimal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut let me check when a\u00b2=720/11, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity, which is consistent with the second approach.\n\nSo, to confirm, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 by choosing a\u00b2 very large.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but wait, no.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 480, but since BD\u00b2 can't be less than 480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480.\n\nWait, but BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, so 480 is the infimum.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\nBut let me compute 480 in terms of the hyperbola.\n\nWait, 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, in the second approach, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as a\u00b2 approaches infinity, so BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired.\n\nTherefore, 480 is the infimum.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nBut wait, in the first approach, when t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/61\u224886.557, which is conflicting.\n\nWait, I think I must have confused the variables in the first approach.\n\nIn the first approach, I expressed BD\u00b2 as 480*(11t -120)/(61t -720).\n\nBut in reality, in the second approach, BD\u00b2=480 +288000/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo, as a\u00b2 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, the correct minimal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, since BD\u00b2 can be as small as approaching 480, the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut wait, no, if BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, then 480 is the infimum, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but 480 is not less than BD\u00b2, it's the infimum.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, it's the maximum lower bound for BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, then 480 is the infimum, and the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nBut wait, no, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480.\n\nWait, no, if BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above, then 480 is the infimum, and any number less than 480 is also less than all BD\u00b2.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest such number, which would be the infimum.\n\nSo, the answer is 480.\n\nBut let me check the calculation again.\n\nFrom BD\u00b2=480 +288000/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nAs a\u00b2 approaches infinity, the term 288000/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ) approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480.\n\nTherefore, the infimum is 480, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but 480 is the infimum, so it's the greatest lower bound.\n\nThus, the answer is 480.\n\nBut let me check with specific values.\n\nLet me choose a\u00b2 very large, say a\u00b2=10000.\n\nThen,\n\nc\u00b2=720(a\u00b2 -20 )/(11 a\u00b2 -720 )=720*(99980 )/(110000 -720 )=720*99980/109280\u2248720*(0.9145 )\u2248658.08.\n\nd\u00b2=600 a\u00b2/(11 a\u00b2 -720

So, d\u00b2\u224855.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 )=4*(658.08 +55 )\u22484*713.08\u22482852.32.\n\nWait, that's way larger than 480.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake in the expression for BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, earlier I had:\n\nBD\u00b2=480 +288000/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo, when a\u00b2=10000,\n\nBD\u00b2=480 +288000/(110000 -720 )=480 +288000/109280\u2248480 +2.63\u2248482.63.\n\nWhich is close to 480.\n\nBut when I computed c\u00b2 and d\u00b2, I got BD\u00b2\u22482852, which is conflicting.\n\nSo, there must be a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, no, in the expression BD\u00b2=480 +288000/(11 a\u00b2 -720 ).\n\nSo, when a\u00b2=10000,\n\nBD\u00b2=480 +288000/(110000 -720 )=480 +288000/109280\u2248480 +2.63\u2248482.63.\n\nBut when I compute c\u00b2 and d\u00b2,\n\nc\u00b2=720*(10000 -20 )/(11*10000 -720 )=720*9980/(110000 -720 )=720*9980/109280.\n\nCompute 720*9980=720*(10000 -20)=7,200,000 -14,400=7,185,600.\n\nDivide by 109280:\n\n7,185,600 /109280\u224865.76.\n\nSimilarly, d\u00b2=600*10000/(11*10000 -720 )=6,000,000/109280\u224854.88.\n\nSo, c\u00b2 +d\u00b2\u224865.76 +54.88\u2248120.64.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 )\u22484*120.64\u2248482.56.\n\nWhich matches the earlier expression.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2\u2248482.56 when a\u00b2=10000.\n\nSo, as a\u00b2 increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, when a\u00b2=1,000,000,\n\nBD\u00b2=480 +288000/(11*1,000,000 -720 )\u2248480 +288000/10,992,800\u2248480 +0.026\u2248480.026.\n\nSo, approaching 480.\n\nTherefore, the infimum is 480.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, that would be 480, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, and 480 is the infimum.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\nBut wait, let me compute 480 in terms of the hyperbola.\n\nWait, the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo, 480 is 24*20.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's a coincidence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward way to see this.\n\nSince BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as the points go to infinity, and BD\u00b2 can't be less than 480, the answer is 480.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{480}.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus \\(ABCD\\) on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to break it down step by step. The problem says:\n\nLet A, B, C, and D be points on the hyperbola (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1 such that ABCD is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nHmm, so we have a hyperbola, and four points on it forming a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. I need to find the greatest number that's less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, I think that means I need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, or maybe the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, but I'm not entirely sure yet. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I should recall some properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me confirm. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, in this case, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.\n\nSo, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint. So, points A and C are opposite vertices, and points B and D are the other pair of opposite vertices. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the coordinates of A and C are negatives of each other, same with B and D.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates:\n\nLet\u2019s say point A is (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, point B is (p, q), so point D is (-p, -q). Since all four points lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the equation (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1, and similarly for the other points.\n\nSo, (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1, and (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, maybe I can use some properties related to the slopes or the vectors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use vectors to represent the points. Let me consider vectors OA, OB, OC, and OD, where O is the origin.\n\nSince it's a rhombus, the vectors OA and OB should form adjacent sides. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are the vectors OA + OB and OA - OB, but I might be mixing things up. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are the vectors from the origin to the opposite vertices. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of vectors.\n\nLet me denote vectors OA = (x, y), OB = (p, q), OC = (-x, -y), and OD = (-p, -q).\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular to each other. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.\n\nWait, AC is from A to C, which is (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from B to D, which is (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q). Alternatively, since diagonals are AC and BD, which are the lines connecting A to C and B to D. The vectors representing the diagonals are AC and BD, which are (-2x, -2y) and (-2p, -2q). Since they are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0 \u21d2 4xp + 4yq = 0 \u21d2 xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, the product of the coordinates satisfies xp + yq = 0. That's one condition.\n\nAnother condition is that all four points lie on the hyperbola. So, (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1 and (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nNow, I need to relate this to BD\u00b2. Wait, BD is one of the diagonals. Let me see: points B and D are (p, q) and (-p, -q), so the distance BD is the distance between these two points.\n\nThe distance between B(p, q) and D(-p, -q) is sqrt[(-p - p)^2 + (-q - q)^2] = sqrt[(-2p)^2 + (-2q)^2] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 is (2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, AC\u00b2 would be 4(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). But since we're looking for BD\u00b2, we can focus on 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, the problem is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the infimum (the greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi ABCD on the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin.\n\nAlternatively, since BD\u00b2 is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), we can find the minimum possible value of p\u00b2 + q\u00b2, subject to (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1 and xp + yq = 0, where (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1 as well.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit involved. Maybe I can parametrize the points on the hyperbola.\n\nFor hyperbola (x\u00b2)/a\u00b2 - (y\u00b2)/b\u00b2 = 1, a parametrization using hyperbolic functions is x = a sec\u03b8, y = b tan\u03b8. Alternatively, another parametrization is x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t, but that's for the right-hand side hyperbola. Alternatively, using rational functions, but perhaps using hyperbola parametrization might complicate things because of the two variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use coordinates with some symmetry. Since the rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, and the points are in pairs (A, C) and (B, D), perhaps I can express points A and B in terms of some parameters and then use the conditions to find relations between them.\n\nGiven that xp + yq = 0, from the perpendicularity of diagonals.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express q in terms of p, y, and x.\n\nFrom xp + yq = 0 \u21d2 q = -(xp)/y.\n\nBut since point B lies on the hyperbola, (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSubstituting q = -(xp)/y into this equation:\n\n(p\u00b2)/20 - [ (x\u00b2p\u00b2)/(y\u00b2) ] /24 = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(p\u00b2)/20 - (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) = 1.\n\nFactor out p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nNow, since point A is on the hyperbola, (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1. Let's solve this for x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 = 20(1 + y\u00b2/24) = 20 + (20 y\u00b2)/24 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nNow, substitute x\u00b2 into the expression for p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 )/(24 y\u00b2) ) ] = 1.\n\nLet me compute the term in the brackets:\n\nTerm = 1/20 - [ (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / (24 y\u00b2) ]\n\nLet me compute the second part:\n\n[ (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / (24 y\u00b2) ) ] = [20/(24 y\u00b2)] + [ (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / (24 y\u00b2) ) ] = (20)/(24 y\u00b2) + (5 y\u00b2)/(6 *24 y\u00b2) )\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: 20/(24 y\u00b2) = (5)/(6 y\u00b2).\n\nSecond term: (5 y\u00b2)/(144 y\u00b2) )= 5/144.\n\nSo, the term becomes:\n\n1/20 - [5/(6 y\u00b2) + 5/144 ].\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - 5/(6 y\u00b2) - 5/144 ] = 1.\n\nLet me compute the expression inside the brackets:\n\nLet me write all terms with denominator 144:\n\n1/20 = 7.2/144? Wait, 144 divided by 20 is 7.2. Alternatively, let's find a common denominator. Let's see: denominators are 20, 6 y\u00b2, 144.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to compute numerically.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to factor 5/(6 y\u00b2) and 5/144 as:\n\n5/(6 y\u00b2) + 5/144 = 5 [ 1/(6 y\u00b2) + 1/144 ].\n\nBut perhaps I should compute 1/20 - 5/(6 y\u00b2) - 5/144.\n\nLet me compute 1/20 as 7.2/144, and 5/144 is 5/144, so 7.2 -5 = 2.2 over 144.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, let me write all terms as fractions:\n\n1/20 = (7.2)/144, but that's decimal. Alternatively, 1/20 = 36/720, 5/(6 y\u00b2) = (60 y\u00b2)/720, but maybe that's complicating.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute 1/20 - 5/(6 y\u00b2) -5/144.\n\nLet me combine the constants:\n\n-5/(6 y\u00b2) -5/144 = -5[ 1/(6 y\u00b2) + 1/144 ].\n\nSo, overall, the term is 1/20 -5[1/(6 y\u00b2) + 1/144].\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor this as:\n\nLet me compute 1/(6 y\u00b2) + 1/144 = (24 + y\u00b2)/(6 y\u00b2 * 24) ) Wait, no, let me find a common denominator.\n\nWait, 6 y\u00b2 and 144 have a common denominator of 144 y\u00b2.\n\nSo, 1/(6 y\u00b2) = 24/(144 y\u00b2), and 1/144 = y\u00b2/(144 y\u00b2). So, adding them together:\n\n(24 + y\u00b2)/(144 y\u00b2).\n\nSo, now the term becomes:\n\n1/20 -5*(24 + y\u00b2)/(144 y\u00b2).\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n1/20 = 7.2/144 (since 144/20=7.2), so 7.2/144 -5*(24 + y\u00b2)/(144 y\u00b2).\n\nWait, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe it's better to represent this as fractions with denominator 144 y\u00b2.\n\nWait, 1/20 = (7.2)/144, but 7.2 is 36/5. So, 1/20 = (36/5)/144 = (36/5)/144 = 36/(5*144) = 1/(5*4) )= 1/20. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider substituting variables. Let me denote s = y\u00b2. Then, since point A is on the hyperbola, (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1 \u21d2 x\u00b2 = 20(1 + y\u00b2/24) = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6) s, where s = y\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, we can express the term in the brackets as:\n\n1/20 -5[1/(6 s) + 1/144].\n\nSo, substituting s, we have:\n\nTerm = 1/20 -5/(6 s) -5/144.\n\nNow, substituting this into the expression for p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [1/20 -5/(6 s) -5/144 ] = 1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 1 / [1/20 -5/(6 s) -5/144 ].\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated, but perhaps I can write it as:\n\np\u00b2 = 1 / [ (1/20) - (5/(6 s)) - (5/144) ].\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the denominator:\n\nDenominator = (1/20) - (5/(6 s)) - (5/144).\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nLet me find a common denominator for all terms. The denominators are 20, 6s, 144.\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of 20, 6, and 144. Let's see:\n\n20 factors into 2\u00b2 * 5,\n\n6 is 2 * 3,\n\n144 is 12\u00b2 = (2\u00b2 *3)^2 = 2^4 *3^2.\n\nSo, LCM is 2^4 *3^2 *5 = 16*9*5=720.\n\nSo, converting each term to denominator 720 s:\n\n1/20 = (36 s)/720 s,\n\n-5/(6 s) = (-600)/720 s,\n\n-5/144 = (-25 s)/720 s.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n1/20 = (36 s)/(720 s) because 720/20=36, and we multiply numerator and denominator by 36 s.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the term is 1/20, which is (1 * 36 s)/ (20 * 36 s) )= (36 s)/(720 s).\n\nSimilarly, -5/(6 s) = (-5 * 120)/(6 s * 120) )= (-600)/(720 s).\n\nSimilarly, -5/144 = (-5 * 5 s)/(144 *5 s) )= (-25 s)/(720 s).\n\nSo, adding all terms:\n\n36 s/(720 s) - 600/(720 s) -25 s/(720 s) = [36 s -600 -25 s]/(720 s).\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n36s -25s =11s, so 11s -600.\n\nThus, denominator becomes (11s -600)/(720 s).\n\nSo, Term = (11s -600)/(720 s).\n\nTherefore, p\u00b2 = 1 / [ (11s -600)/(720 s) ) ] = 720 s / (11s -600).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = (720 s)/(11s -600).\n\nNow, since p\u00b2 must be positive, the denominator 11s -600 must be positive because s is y\u00b2, which is positive.\n\nSo, 11s -600 > 0 \u21d2 s > 600/11 \u224854.545.\n\nSo, s must be greater than approximately 54.545.\n\nNow, since s = y\u00b2, and point A lies on the hyperbola, s must satisfy (x\u00b2)/20 - s/24 = 1 \u21d2 x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 s)/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 must be positive, which it is as long as s is positive, which it is.\n\nSo, s > 600/11.\n\nNow, let's express BD\u00b2 in terms of s.\n\nEarlier, we saw that BD\u00b2 =4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nBut from earlier, we have q = -(x p)/y.\n\nSo, q = -(x p)/y.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/y\u00b2.\n\nBut y\u00b2 = s, and x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 s)/6.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = [ (20 + (5 s)/6 ) * p\u00b2 ] / s.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) =4[ p\u00b2 + (20 + (5 s)/6 ) p\u00b2 / s ]\n\n=4p\u00b2 [1 + (20 + (5 s)/6 ) / s ]\n\n=4p\u00b2 [ (s + 20 + (5 s)/6 ) / s ]\n\nLet me compute the numerator inside the brackets:\n\ns + 20 + (5 s)/6 = (6s + 120 +5s)/6 = (11s + 120)/6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4p\u00b2 * (11s + 120)/(6 s).\n\nSimplify:\n\nBD\u00b2 = (4p\u00b2 (11s + 120)) / (6 s ) = (2 p\u00b2 (11s + 120)) / (3 s).\n\nNow, from earlier, we have p\u00b2 = 720 s / (11s -600).\n\nSo, substituting p\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 = (2*(720 s/(11s -600)) * (11s +120)) / (3 s).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n= (2 *720 s * (11s +120)) / [ 3 s (11s -600) ) ]\n\nThe s in numerator and denominator cancels:\n\n= (2 *720 * (11s +120)) / [ 3 (11s -600) ) ]\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n2*720=1440, 1440/3=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= 480*(11s +120)/(11s -600).\n\nNow, we can write BD\u00b2 as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480*(11s +120)/(11s -600).\n\nWe need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2, as s approaches the lower limit of s>600/11 \u224854.545.\n\nWait, but s must be greater than 600/11 for p\u00b2 to be positive.\n\nSo, let's denote t = 11s -600, so t>0.\n\nThen, s = (t +600)/11.\n\nSubstituting into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 =480*(11*( (t +600)/11 ) +120 ) / t.\n\nSimplify numerator inside the brackets:\n\n11*( (t +600)/11 ) = t +600.\n\nSo, numerator becomes (t +600 +120) = t +720.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2=480*(t +720)/t =480*(1 +720/t).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480 + (480*720)/t.\n\nSince t>0, as t approaches zero from the positive side, (480*720)/t approaches infinity. So, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity as t approaches zero. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when t is as large as possible, but t can be any positive number, so perhaps BD\u00b2 can be minimized when t is as large as possible.\n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Let me check again.\n\nWait, from BD\u00b2=480*(11s +120)/(11s -600).\n\nLet me see what happens when s approaches 600/11 from above. Let's compute the limit as s approaches 600/11 from the right.\n\nLet me compute (11s +120)/(11s -600).\n\nAt s=600/11, the denominator is zero, so the expression tends to infinity. So, BD\u00b2 tends to infinity as s approaches 600/11 from above.\n\nAs s increases, what happens to BD\u00b2?\n\nLet me compute the derivative of BD\u00b2 with respect to s to find its minimum.\n\nLet me denote f(s) = (11s +120)/(11s -600).\n\nCompute f'(s):\n\nf'(s) = [11*(11s -600) - (11s +120)*11 ] / (11s -600)^2.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n11*(11s -600) -11*(11s +120) = 11*(11s -600 -11s -120) =11*(-720) = -7920.\n\nSo, f'(s) = -7920/(11s -600)^2.\n\nSince 11s -600 >0, the denominator is positive, so f'(s) is negative. So, f(s) is decreasing as s increases.\n\nTherefore, as s increases, f(s) decreases, so BD\u00b2=480*f(s) decreases as s increases.\n\nSo, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 occurs as s approaches infinity.\n\nCompute the limit as s approaches infinity:\n\nlim s\u2192\u221e (11s +120)/(11s -600) = 11/11 =1.\n\nThus, lim s\u2192\u221e BD\u00b2 =480*1=480.\n\nSo, as s increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nBut we can't reach s=infinity, so BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as possible but can't be less than 480. So, 480 is the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that would be 480, because BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 but never less than it.\n\nWait, but wait, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be 480, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480. So, the infimum is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this reasoning because sometimes I might mix up minima and maxima.\n\nWait, from the earlier analysis, as s increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, and BD\u00b2 can be as large as possible (approaching infinity as s approaches 600/11 from above). So, the minimal value is 480, so BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by plugging in some specific values.\n\nSuppose s is very large, say s approaches infinity. Then, f(s) approaches 1, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480. So, BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, but can't be less than 480. So, the infimum is 480, which is the greatest lower bound.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to break it down step by step. The problem says:\n\nLet A, B, C, and D be points on the hyperbola (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1 such that ABCD is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nHmm, so we have a hyperbola, and four points on it forming a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. I need to find the greatest number that's less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, I think that means I need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, or maybe the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, but I'm not entirely sure yet. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I should recall some properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me confirm. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, in this case, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.\n\nSo, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint. So, points A and C are opposite vertices, and points B and D are the other pair of opposite vertices. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the coordinates of A and C are negatives of each other, same with B and D.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates:\n\nLet\u2019s say point A is (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, point B is (p, q), so point D is (-p, -q). Since all four points lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the equation (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1, and similarly for the other points.\n\nSo, (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1, and (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, maybe I can use some properties related to the slopes or the vectors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use vectors to represent the points. Let me consider vectors OA, OB, OC, and OD, where O is the origin.\n\nSince it's a rhombus, the vectors OA and OB should form adjacent sides. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are the vectors OA + OB and OA - OB, but I might be mixing things up. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are the vectors from the origin to the opposite vertices. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of vectors.\n\nLet me denote vectors OA = (x, y), OB = (p, q), OC = (-x, -y), and OD = (-p, -q).\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular to each other. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.\n\nWait, AC is from A to C, which is (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from B to D, which is (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q). Alternatively, since diagonals are AC and BD, which are the lines connecting A to C and B to D. The vectors representing the diagonals are AC and BD, which are (-2x, -2y) and (-2p, -2q). Since they are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0 \u21d2 4xp + 4yq = 0 \u21d2 xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, the product of the coordinates satisfies xp + yq = 0. That's one condition.\n\nAnother condition is that all four points lie on the hyperbola. So, (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1 and (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nNow, I need to relate this to BD\u00b2. Wait, BD is one of the diagonals. Let me see: points B and D are (p, q) and (-p, -q), so the distance BD is the distance between these two points.\n\nThe distance between B(p, q) and D(-p, -q) is sqrt[(-p - p)^2 + (-q - q)^2] = sqrt[(-2p)^2 + (-2q)^2] = sqrt[4p\u00b2 + 4q\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 is (2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, AC\u00b2 would be 4(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). But since we're looking for BD\u00b2, we can focus on 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, the problem is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the infimum (the greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi ABCD on the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin.\n\nAlternatively, since BD\u00b2 is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), we can find the minimum possible value of p\u00b2 + q\u00b2, subject to (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1 and xp + yq = 0, where (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1 as well.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit involved. Maybe I can parametrize the points on the hyperbola.\n\nFor hyperbola (x\u00b2)/a\u00b2 - (y\u00b2)/b\u00b2 = 1, a parametrization using hyperbolic functions is x = a sec\u03b8, y = b tan\u03b8. Alternatively, another parametrization is x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t, but that's for the right-hand side hyperbola. Alternatively, using rational functions, but perhaps using hyperbola parametrization might complicate things because of the two variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use coordinates with some symmetry. Since the rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, and the points are in pairs (A, C) and (B, D), perhaps I can express points A and B in terms of some parameters and then use the conditions to find relations between them.\n\nGiven that xp + yq = 0, from the perpendicularity of diagonals.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express q in terms of p, y, and x.\n\nFrom xp + yq = 0 \u21d2 q = -(xp)/y.\n\nBut since point B lies on the hyperbola, (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSubstituting q = -(xp)/y into this equation:\n\n(p\u00b2)/20 - [ (x\u00b2p\u00b2)/(y\u00b2) ] /24 = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(p\u00b2)/20 - (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) = 1.\n\nFactor out p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nNow, since point A is on the hyperbola, (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1. Let's solve this for x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 = 20(1 + y\u00b2/24) = 20 + (20 y\u00b2)/24 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nNow, substitute x\u00b2 into the expression for p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 )/(24 y\u00b2) ) ] = 1.\n\nLet me compute the term in the brackets:\n\nTerm = 1/20 - [ (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / (24 y\u00b2) ]\n\nLet me compute the second part:\n\n[ (20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / (24 y\u00b2) ) ] = [20/(24 y\u00b2)] + [ (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) / (24 y\u00b2) ) ] = (20)/(24 y\u00b2) + (5 y\u00b2)/(6 *24 y\u00b2) )\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: 20/(24 y\u00b2) = (5)/(6 y\u00b2).\n\nSecond term: (5 y\u00b2)/(144 y\u00b2) )= 5/144.\n\nSo, the term becomes:\n\n1/20 - [5/(6 y\u00b2) + 5/144 ].\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - 5/(6 y\u00b2) - 5/144 ] = 1.\n\nLet me compute the expression inside the brackets:\n\nLet me write all terms with denominator 144:\n\n1/20 = 7.2/144? Wait, 144 divided by 20 is 7.2. Alternatively, let's find a common denominator. Let's see: denominators are 20, 6 y\u00b2, 144.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to compute numerically.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to factor 5/(6 y\u00b2) and 5/144 as:\n\n5/(6 y\u00b2) + 5/144 = 5 [ 1/(6 y\u00b2) + 1/144 ].\n\nBut perhaps I should compute 1/20 - 5/(6 y\u00b2) - 5/144.\n\nLet me compute 1/20 as 7.2/144, and 5/144 is 5/144, so 7.2 -5 = 2.2 over 144.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, let me write all terms as fractions:\n\n1/20 = (7.2)/144, but that's decimal. Alternatively, 1/20 = 36/720, 5/(6 y\u00b2) = (60 y\u00b2)/720, but maybe that's complicating.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute 1/20 - 5/(6 y\u00b2) -5/144.\n\nLet me combine the constants:\n\n-5/(6 y\u00b2) -5/144 = -5[ 1/(6 y\u00b2) + 1/144 ].\n\nSo, overall, the term is 1/20 -5[1/(6 y\u00b2) + 1/144].\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor this as:\n\nLet me compute 1/(6 y\u00b2) + 1/144 = (24 + y\u00b2)/(6 y\u00b2 * 24) ) Wait, no, let me find a common denominator.\n\nWait, 6 y\u00b2 and 144 have a common denominator of 144 y\u00b2.\n\nSo, 1/(6 y\u00b2) = 24/(144 y\u00b2), and 1/144 = y\u00b2/(144 y\u00b2). So, adding them together:\n\n(24 + y\u00b2)/(144 y\u00b2).\n\nSo, now the term becomes:\n\n1/20 -5*(24 + y\u00b2)/(144 y\u00b2).\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n1/20 = 7.2/144 (since 144/20=7.2), so 7.2/144 -5*(24 + y\u00b2)/(144 y\u00b2).\n\nWait, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe it's better to represent this as fractions with denominator 144 y\u00b2.\n\nWait, 1/20 = (7.2)/144, but 7.2 is 36/5. So, 1/20 = (36/5)/144 = (36/5)/144 = 36/(5*144) = 1/(5*4) )= 1/20. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider substituting variables. Let me denote s = y\u00b2. Then, since point A is on the hyperbola, (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1 \u21d2 x\u00b2 = 20(1 + y\u00b2/24) = 20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6) s, where s = y\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, we can express the term in the brackets as:\n\n1/20 -5[1/(6 s) + 1/144].\n\nSo, substituting s, we have:\n\nTerm = 1/20 -5/(6 s) -5/144.\n\nNow, substituting this into the expression for p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [1/20 -5/(6 s) -5/144 ] = 1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 1 / [1/20 -5/(6 s) -5/144 ].\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated, but perhaps I can write it as:\n\np\u00b2 = 1 / [ (1/20) - (5/(6 s)) - (5/144) ].\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the denominator:\n\nDenominator = (1/20) - (5/(6 s)) - (5/144).\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nLet me find a common denominator for all terms. The denominators are 20, 6s, 144.\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of 20, 6, and 144. Let's see:\n\n20 factors into 2\u00b2 * 5,\n\n6 is 2 * 3,\n\n144 is 12\u00b2 = (2\u00b2 *3)^2 = 2^4 *3^2.\n\nSo, LCM is 2^4 *3^2 *5 = 16*9*5=720.\n\nSo, converting each term to denominator 720 s:\n\n1/20 = (36 s)/720 s,\n\n-5/(6 s) = (-600)/720 s,\n\n-5/144 = (-25 s)/720 s.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n1/20 = (36 s)/(720 s) because 720/20=36, and we multiply numerator and denominator by 36 s.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the term is 1/20, which is (1 * 36 s)/ (20 * 36 s) )= (36 s)/(720 s).\n\nSimilarly, -5/(6 s) = (-5 * 120)/(6 s * 120) )= (-600)/(720 s).\n\nSimilarly, -5/144 = (-5 * 5 s)/(144 *5 s) )= (-25 s)/(720 s).\n\nSo, adding all terms:\n\n36 s/(720 s) - 600/(720 s) -25 s/(720 s) = [36 s -600 -25 s]/(720 s).\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n36s -25s =11s, so 11s -600.\n\nThus, denominator becomes (11s -600)/(720 s).\n\nSo, Term = (11s -600)/(720 s).\n\nTherefore, p\u00b2 = 1 / [ (11s -600)/(720 s) ) ] = 720 s / (11s -600).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = (720 s)/(11s -600).\n\nNow, since p\u00b2 must be positive, the denominator 11s -600 must be positive because s is y\u00b2, which is positive.\n\nSo, 11s -600 > 0 \u21d2 s > 600/11 \u224854.545.\n\nSo, s must be greater than approximately 54.545.\n\nNow, since s = y\u00b2, and point A lies on the hyperbola, s must satisfy (x\u00b2)/20 - s/24 = 1 \u21d2 x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 s)/6.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 must be positive, which it is as long as s is positive, which it is.\n\nSo, s > 600/11.\n\nNow, let's express BD\u00b2 in terms of s.\n\nEarlier, we saw that BD\u00b2 =4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nBut from earlier, we have q = -(x p)/y.\n\nSo, q = -(x p)/y.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/y\u00b2.\n\nBut y\u00b2 = s, and x\u00b2 = 20 + (5 s)/6.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = [ (20 + (5 s)/6 ) * p\u00b2 ] / s.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) =4[ p\u00b2 + (20 + (5 s)/6 ) p\u00b2 / s ]\n\n=4p\u00b2 [1 + (20 + (5 s)/6 ) / s ]\n\n=4p\u00b2 [ (s + 20 + (5 s)/6 ) / s ]\n\nLet me compute the numerator inside the brackets:\n\ns + 20 + (5 s)/6 = (6s + 120 +5s)/6 = (11s + 120)/6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4p\u00b2 * (11s + 120)/(6 s).\n\nSimplify:\n\nBD\u00b2 = (4p\u00b2 (11s + 120)) / (6 s ) = (2 p\u00b2 (11s + 120)) / (3 s).\n\nNow, from earlier, we have p\u00b2 = 720 s / (11s -600).\n\nSo, substituting p\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 = (2*(720 s/(11s -600)) * (11s +120)) / (3 s).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n= (2 *720 s * (11s +120)) / [ 3 s (11s -600) ) ]\n\nThe s in numerator and denominator cancels:\n\n= (2 *720 * (11s +120)) / [ 3 (11s -600) ) ]\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n2*720=1440, 1440/3=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= 480*(11s +120)/(11s -600).\n\nNow, we can write BD\u00b2 as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480*(11s +120)/(11s -600).\n\nWe need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2, as s approaches the lower limit of s>600/11 \u224854.545.\n\nWait, but s must be greater than 600/11 for p\u00b2 to be positive.\n\nSo, let's denote t = 11s -600, so t>0.\n\nThen, s = (t +600)/11.\n\nSubstituting into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 =480*(11*( (t +600)/11 ) +120 ) / t.\n\nSimplify numerator inside the brackets:\n\n11*( (t +600)/11 ) = t +600.\n\nSo, numerator becomes (t +600 +120) = t +720.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2=480*(t +720)/t =480*(1 +720/t).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480 + (480*720)/t.\n\nSince t>0, as t approaches zero from the positive side, (480*720)/t approaches infinity. So, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity as t approaches zero. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when t is as large as possible, but t can be any positive number, so perhaps BD\u00b2 can be minimized when t is as large as possible.\n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Let me check again.\n\nWait, from BD\u00b2=480*(11s +120)/(11s -600).\n\nLet me see what happens when s approaches 600/11 from above. Let's compute the limit as s approaches 600/11 from the right.\n\nLet me compute (11s +120)/(11s -600).\n\nAt s=600/11, the denominator is zero, so the expression tends to infinity. So, BD\u00b2 tends to infinity as s approaches 600/11 from above.\n\nAs s increases, what happens to BD\u00b2?\n\nLet me compute the derivative of BD\u00b2 with respect to s to find its minimum.\n\nLet me denote f(s) = (11s +120)/(11s -600).\n\nCompute f'(s):\n\nf'(s) = [11*(11s -600) - (11s +120)*11 ] / (11s -600)^2.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n11*(11s -600) -11*(11s +120) = 11*(11s -600 -11s -120) =11*(-720) = -7920.\n\nSo, f'(s) = -7920/(11s -600)^2.\n\nSince 11s -600 >0, the denominator is positive, so f'(s) is negative. So, f(s) is decreasing as s increases.\n\nTherefore, as s increases, f(s) decreases, so BD\u00b2=480*f(s) decreases as s increases.\n\nSo, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 occurs as s approaches infinity.\n\nCompute the limit as s approaches infinity:\n\nlim s\u2192\u221e (11s +120)/(11s -600) = 11/11 =1.\n\nThus, lim s\u2192\u221e BD\u00b2 =480*1=480.\n\nSo, as s increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nBut we can't reach s=infinity, so BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as possible but can't be less than 480. So, 480 is the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that would be 480, because BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 but never less than it.\n\nWait, but wait, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be 480, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480. So, the infimum is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this reasoning because sometimes I might mix up minima and maxima.\n\nWait, from the earlier analysis, as s increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, and BD\u00b2 can be as large as possible (approaching infinity as s approaches 600/11 from above). So, the minimal value is 480, so BD\u00b2 is always \u2265480. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by plugging in some specific values.\n\nSuppose s is very large, say s approaches infinity. Then, f(s) approaches 1, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480. So, BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, but can't be less than 480. So, the infimum is 480, which is the greatest lower bound.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\n\nThe greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombi is \\(\\boxed{480}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola given by the equation (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, wait\u2014actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me double-check. No, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular. Wait, wait, I think I'm confusing with a kite. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Yes, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's an important property.\n\nSo, the rhombus ABCD has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the diagonals of the rhombus are along the coordinate axes or maybe some other lines? Wait, no, because the hyperbola is symmetric about both the x-axis and y-axis, so it's likely that the diagonals are along these axes. But not necessarily, because the rhombus can be rotated.\n\nWait, but if the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, then the points A, B, C, D must be symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C would be (-x, -y), since they are opposite vertices. Similarly, points B and D would be symmetric across the origin as well. So, that makes sense.\n\nBut wait, the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint. So, the diagonals are the lines connecting A to C and B to D. So, in this case, since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can parametrize the points. Let me think. Let me consider that the diagonals are AC and BD. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, if I let A = (a, b), then C = (-a, -b). Similarly, if B = (c, d), then D = (-c, -d). Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C, and so on.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to use vectors here. Alternatively, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates satisfy (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can express the coordinates of the points in terms of some parameters.\n\nLet me think about the diagonals. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. So, if vector AC is (a, b) - (-a, -b) = (2a, 2b), but wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, if A is (a, b), then C is (-a, -b), so the vector AC would be from A to C, which is (-2a, -2b). Similarly, the vector BD would be from B to D, which is (-2c, -2d). But since the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, vector AC \u00b7 vector BD = (-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 4ac + 4bd = 0. So, 4(ac + bd) = 0 => ac + bd = 0.\n\nThat's one condition.\n\nAlso, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the length AB equals BC equals CD equals DA.\n\nLet me compute AB\u00b2, BC\u00b2, etc. Let's compute AB\u00b2. AB is from A(a, b) to B(c, d), so AB\u00b2 = (c - a)\u00b2 + (d - b)\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, BC\u00b2 = (-a - c)\u00b2 + (-b - d)\u00b2 = ( -a - c )\u00b2 + ( -b - d )\u00b2 = (a + c)\u00b2 + (b + d)\u00b2.\n\nSince AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2, we have:\n\n(c - a)\u00b2 + (d - b)\u00b2 = (a + c)\u00b2 + (b + d)\u00b2.\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side: (c\u00b2 - 2ac + a\u00b2) + (d\u00b2 - 2bd + b\u00b2) = a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - 2ac - 2bd.\n\nRight side: (a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2) + (b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2) = a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + 2ac + 2bd.\n\nSo, setting left equal to right:\n\na\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - 2ac - 2bd = a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + 2ac + 2bd.\n\nSubtracting the left side from both sides:\n\n0 = 4ac + 4bd.\n\nSo, 4(ac + bd) = 0 => ac + bd = 0.\n\nWait, but that's the same condition as before. So, that's consistent. So, that gives me one equation: ac + bd = 0.\n\nBut I also need to use the fact that all four points lie on the hyperbola. So, for points A(a, b), B(c, d), C(-a, -b), D(-c, -d), each must satisfy (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSo, for point A: (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly for point B: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSo, now I have these two equations:\n\n1) (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\n2) (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nAnd also the condition from the diagonals being perpendicular: ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, now, I need to find BD\u00b2. BD is the distance between points B and D. Wait, but wait, in a rhombus, BD is one of the diagonals. Wait, no, in the rhombus, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, BD is the other diagonal. So, the length of BD is the distance between points B and D, which is sqrt[(c - (-c))\u00b2 + (d - (-d))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2c)\u00b2 + (2d)\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 is (2c)\u00b2 + (2d)\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, AC is the other diagonal, from A(a, b) to C(-a, -b), so AC\u00b2 is (2a)\u00b2 + (2b)\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2).\n\nSo, in the rhombus, the diagonals are AC and BD, with lengths sqrt(4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)) and sqrt(4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2)) respectively.\n\nBut in a rhombus, the area can also be expressed as (AC * BD)/2, but since the sides are equal, maybe that's not directly helpful here.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the sides can also be related to the diagonals. The sides are equal to sqrt[(AC/2)\u00b2 + (BD/2)\u00b2], because each side is half the length of the diagonals, and they form right triangles.\n\nSo, each side of the rhombus is equal to sqrt[( (AC)/2 )\u00b2 + ( (BD)/2 )\u00b2 ].\n\nSo, since all sides are equal, AB = BC = CD = DA = sqrt[ ( (AC)/2 )\u00b2 + ( (BD)/2 )\u00b2 ].\n\nSo, AB\u00b2 = ( (AC)/2 )\u00b2 + ( (BD)/2 )\u00b2.\n\nBut from earlier, AB\u00b2 is (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2.\n\nHmm, but maybe I can express AB\u00b2 in terms of AC and BD.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about the sides in terms of vectors.\n\nAlternatively, since we have four points on the hyperbola, perhaps I can find a parametrization for points on the hyperbola and use that.\n\nI know that hyperbolas can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions. So, for the hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a parametrization is (a cosh \u03b8, b sinh \u03b8). But I'm not sure if that's the easiest way here.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the standard parametrization for hyperbola points. For hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, a parametrization could be (sqrt(20) sec \u03b8, sqrt(24) tan \u03b8). But wait, actually, hyperbola parametrization is usually done using hyperbolic functions: x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t. Let me use that.\n\nSo, for point A, we can write A as (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t). Similarly, another point can be parametrized with a different parameter.\n\nBut since the diagonals are perpendicular, maybe there's a relationship between the parameters of the points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that points A and C are (a, b) and (-a, -b), so point A is (a, b), C is (-a, -b). Similarly, points B and D are (c, d) and (-c, -d). So, now, the four points are A(a, b), B(c, d), C(-a, -b), D(-c, -d).\n\nSo, in this case, the rhombus is formed by these four points.\n\nNow, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So, let's compute AB\u00b2 and set it equal to BC\u00b2.\n\nWait, earlier when I computed AB\u00b2 and BC\u00b2, I got the condition ac + bd = 0, which comes from equating AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2.\n\nSo, that's one condition.\n\nAlso, we have that A and B lie on the hyperbola, so:\n\nFor point A: (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nFor point B: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nSo, now, I have three equations:\n\n1) (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\n2) (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\n3) ac + bd =0.\n\nAnd I need to find BD\u00b2 =4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). So, I need to find the maximum lower bound for BD\u00b2, i.e., find the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, in other words, find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi, and then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 would be that infimum.\n\nSo, I need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, given the constraints, and then the answer would be that minimal value. Wait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if the minimal BD\u00b2 is m, then any number less than m would satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But the greatest such number is m itself if m is the infimum. Wait, but if BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to m, but not less than m, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be m. Hmm, I think that's correct.\n\nSo, to find the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), given the constraints.\n\nSo, how can I express c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 in terms of the hyperbola equation?\n\nFrom equation 2, (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nLet me solve for c\u00b2: c\u00b2 = 20(1 + (d\u00b2)/24).\n\nSo, c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 = 20(1 + (d\u00b2)/24) + d\u00b2 = 20 + (20 d\u00b2)/24 + d\u00b2 = 20 + (5 d\u00b2)/6 + d\u00b2 = 20 + (11 d\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 = 20 + (11 d\u00b2)/6.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 1, (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1 => a\u00b2 = 20(1 + (b\u00b2)/24).\n\nSo, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 20(1 + (b\u00b2)/24) + b\u00b2 = 20 + (20 b\u00b2)/24 + b\u00b2 = 20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 + b\u00b2 = 20 + (11 b\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =20 + (11 b\u00b2)/6.\n\nNow, from the condition ac + bd =0.\n\nSo, ac = -bd.\n\nLet me square both sides: a\u00b2 c\u00b2 = b\u00b2 d\u00b2.\n\nBut from above, we have a\u00b2 =20(1 + (b\u00b2)/24) and c\u00b2 =20(1 + (d\u00b2)/24).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n[20(1 + (b\u00b2)/24)] [20(1 + (d\u00b2)/24)] = b\u00b2 d\u00b2.\n\nSo, 400 (1 + (b\u00b2)/24)(1 + (d\u00b2)/24) = b\u00b2 d\u00b2.\n\nLet me denote u = b\u00b2 and v = d\u00b2. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n400 (1 + u/24)(1 + v/24) = u v.\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n400 [1 + u/24 + v/24 + (u v)/(24\u00b2)] = u v.\n\nMultiply through:\n\n400 + (400 u)/24 + (400 v)/24 + (400 u v)/(576) = u v.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n400 + (400/24)u + (400/24)v + (400/576) u v = u v.\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\n400/24 = 50/3 \u224816.6667.\n\n400/576 = 25/36 \u22480.6944.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n400 + (50/3)u + (50/3)v + (25/36) u v = u v.\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side:\n\n400 + (50/3)u + (50/3)v + (25/36) u v - u v =0.\n\nCombine the u v terms:\n\n(25/36 - 1) u v = (-11/36) u v.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n400 + (50/3)(u + v) - (11/36) u v =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 36 to eliminate denominators:\n\n36*400 + 50*12*(u + v) -11 u v =0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n36*400 = 14400.\n\n50*12=600. So, 600(u + v).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n14400 + 600(u + v) -11 u v =0.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n-11 u v +600 u +600 v +14400=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by (-1):\n\n11 u v -600 u -600 v -14400=0.\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic in u and v.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this as:\n\n11 u v -600 u -600 v =14400.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but maybe I can factor it.\n\nLet me try to write this as:\n\n11 u v -600 u -600 v =14400.\n\nLet me add 600\u00b2/(11) to both sides to complete the rectangle, but this might get messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set variables p = u + k and q = v + l to eliminate the linear terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider u and v as variables and solve for one in terms of the other.\n\nLet me try to solve for u in terms of v.\n\nFrom equation:\n\n11 u v -600 u -600 v =14400.\n\nLet me factor u:\n\nu (11 v -600) -600 v =14400.\n\nThen,\n\nu (11 v -600) =600 v +14400.\n\nSo,\n\nu = (600 v +14400)/(11 v -600).\n\nHmm, that might be useful.\n\nSo, u is expressed in terms of v.\n\nSimilarly, since u = b\u00b2 and v = d\u00b2, which are squares, they must be non-negative.\n\nMoreover, from the hyperbola equation, for point B: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1 => c\u00b2 =20(1 + d\u00b2/24). So, c\u00b2 must be positive, which is always true.\n\nSimilarly, for point A: a\u00b2 =20(1 + b\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, u and v must be such that 11 v -600 is not zero, so v \u2260600/11 \u224854.545.\n\nBut since u and v are squares, they are non-negative, so we need 11 v -600 \u22600.\n\nSo, if 11 v -600 is positive, then u is positive, which is acceptable.\n\nIf 11 v -600 is negative, then the numerator must also be negative to have u positive.\n\nLet me see: 600 v +14400.\n\nIf 11 v -600 <0, then v <600/11\u224854.545.\n\nThen, 600 v +14400 is positive since v is non-negative.\n\nSo, u would be negative, which is not possible because u =b\u00b2 \u22650.\n\nTherefore, 11 v -600 must be positive, so v >600/11\u224854.545.\n\nSo, v must be greater than 54.545.\n\nSimilarly, since u = (600 v +14400)/(11 v -600), and u must be positive, as v >600/11.\n\nSo, now, we can express c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 in terms of v.\n\nEarlier, we had c\u00b2 + d\u00b2=20 + (11 d\u00b2)/6=20 + (11 v)/6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2)=4*(20 + (11 v)/6)=80 + (44 v)/6=80 + (22 v)/3.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 + (22 v)/3.\n\nSo, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize v, given the constraints.\n\nSince v must be greater than 600/11\u224854.545, the minimal v is just above 54.545.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a minimal v beyond which the points can't lie on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, but let me check: as v approaches 600/11 from above, what happens to u?\n\nu=(600 v +14400)/(11 v -600).\n\nLet me compute the limit as v approaches 600/11 from above.\n\nLet me set v =600/11 + \u03b5, where \u03b5 approaches 0+.\n\nSo,\n\nu=(600*(600/11 + \u03b5) +14400)/(11*(600/11 + \u03b5) -600).\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n11*(600/11) +11 \u03b5 -600=600 +11 \u03b5 -600=11 \u03b5.\n\nNumerator:\n\n600*(600/11) +600 \u03b5 +14400.\n\nCompute 600*(600/11)= (600^2)/11=360000/11\u224832727.27.\n\nSo, numerator\u224832727.27 +600 \u03b5 +14400=47127.27 +600 \u03b5.\n\nSo, u\u2248(47127.27 +600 \u03b5)/(11 \u03b5).\n\nAs \u03b5 approaches 0+, u approaches infinity.\n\nSo, u becomes very large as v approaches 600/11 from above.\n\nSimilarly, if I let v approach infinity, what happens to u?\n\nu=(600 v +14400)/(11 v -600)\u2248(600 v)/(11 v)=600/11\u224854.545.\n\nSo, as v increases, u approaches 600/11.\n\nSo, the minimal v is just above 600/11, but u approaches infinity as v approaches 600/11 from above.\n\nWait, but that suggests that BD\u00b2=80 + (22 v)/3, which as v approaches 600/11 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches 80 + (22*(600/11))/3=80 + (1200/3)=80 +400=480.\n\nWait, so as v approaches 600/11 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut can BD\u00b2 be exactly 480?\n\nWait, because when v=600/11, the denominator becomes zero, which is undefined, so v must be greater than 600/11, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nSimilarly, when v is very large, u approaches 600/11, and BD\u00b2=80 + (22 v)/3 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is approaching 480, but can't actually reach it.\n\nSo, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, meaning that BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 but never less than that.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can approach 480 but never be less than 480, then 480 is the infimum, and the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480.\n\nWait, but no, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, since 480 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, and any number greater than 480 would not satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi (since BD\u00b2 can be just above 480).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if the infimum is 480, then the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let me suppose that BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as we like. So, for any \u03b5>0, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 <480 + \u03b5. Therefore, the infimum is 480. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the infimum is 480, then for any number less than 480, say 479, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than 479. So, that can't be. Wait, no, actually, if the infimum is 480, then BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired from above, but never less than 480. So, 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480. So, the answer is 480.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations. I found that BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as v approaches 600/11 from above. So, BD\u00b2 can be as close to 480 as we want, but not less than 480. So, 480 is the infimum.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola given by the equation (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, wait\u2014actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me double-check. No, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular. Wait, wait, I think I'm confusing with a kite. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Yes, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's an important property.\n\nSo, the rhombus ABCD has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the diagonals of the rhombus are along the coordinate axes or maybe some other lines? Wait, no, because the hyperbola is symmetric about both the x-axis and y-axis, so it's likely that the diagonals are along these axes. But not necessarily, because the rhombus can be rotated.\n\nWait, but if the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, then the points A, B, C, D must be symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C would be (-x, -y), since they are opposite vertices. Similarly, points B and D would be symmetric across the origin as well. So, that makes sense.\n\nBut wait, the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint. So, the diagonals are the lines connecting A to C and B to D. So, in this case, since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can parametrize the points. Let me think. Let me consider that the diagonals are AC and BD. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, if I let A = (a, b), then C = (-a, -b). Similarly, if B = (c, d), then D = (-c, -d). Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C, and so on.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to use vectors here. Alternatively, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates satisfy (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can express the coordinates of the points in terms of some parameters.\n\nLet me think about the diagonals. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. So, if vector AC is (a, b) - (-a, -b) = (2a, 2b), but wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, if A is (a, b), then C is (-a, -b), so the vector AC would be from A to C, which is (-2a, -2b). Similarly, the vector BD would be from B to D, which is (-2c, -2d). But since the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, vector AC \u00b7 vector BD = (-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 4ac + 4bd = 0. So, 4(ac + bd) = 0 => ac + bd = 0.\n\nThat's one condition.\n\nAlso, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the length AB equals BC equals CD equals DA.\n\nLet me compute AB\u00b2, BC\u00b2, etc. Let's compute AB\u00b2. AB is from A(a, b) to B(c, d), so AB\u00b2 = (c - a)\u00b2 + (d - b)\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, BC\u00b2 = (-a - c)\u00b2 + (-b - d)\u00b2 = ( -a - c )\u00b2 + ( -b - d )\u00b2 = (a + c)\u00b2 + (b + d)\u00b2.\n\nSince AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2, we have:\n\n(c - a)\u00b2 + (d - b)\u00b2 = (a + c)\u00b2 + (b + d)\u00b2.\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side: (c\u00b2 - 2ac + a\u00b2) + (d\u00b2 - 2bd + b\u00b2) = a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - 2ac - 2bd.\n\nRight side: (a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2) + (b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2) = a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + 2ac + 2bd.\n\nSo, setting left equal to right:\n\na\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - 2ac - 2bd = a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + 2ac + 2bd.\n\nSubtracting the left side from both sides:\n\n0 = 4ac + 4bd.\n\nSo, 4(ac + bd) = 0 => ac + bd = 0.\n\nWait, but that's the same condition as before. So, that's consistent. So, that gives me one equation: ac + bd = 0.\n\nBut I also need to use the fact that all four points lie on the hyperbola. So, for points A(a, b), B(c, d), C(-a, -b), D(-c, -d), each must satisfy (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSo, for point A: (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly for point B: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSo, now I have these two equations:\n\n1) (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\n2) (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nAnd also the condition from the diagonals being perpendicular: ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, now, I need to find BD\u00b2. BD is the distance between points B and D. Wait, but wait, in a rhombus, BD is one of the diagonals. Wait, no, in the rhombus, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, BD is the other diagonal. So, the length of BD is the distance between points B and D, which is sqrt[(c - (-c))\u00b2 + (d - (-d))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2c)\u00b2 + (2d)\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 is (2c)\u00b2 + (2d)\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, AC is the other diagonal, from A(a, b) to C(-a, -b), so AC\u00b2 is (2a)\u00b2 + (2b)\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2).\n\nSo, in the rhombus, the diagonals are AC and BD, with lengths sqrt(4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)) and sqrt(4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2)) respectively.\n\nBut in a rhombus, the area can also be expressed as (AC * BD)/2, but since the sides are equal, maybe that's not directly helpful here.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the sides can also be related to the diagonals. The sides are equal to sqrt[(AC/2)\u00b2 + (BD/2)\u00b2], because each side is half the length of the diagonals, and they form right triangles.\n\nSo, each side of the rhombus is equal to sqrt[( (AC)/2 )\u00b2 + ( (BD)/2 )\u00b2 ].\n\nSo, since all sides are equal, AB = BC = CD = DA = sqrt[ ( (AC)/2 )\u00b2 + ( (BD)/2 )\u00b2 ].\n\nSo, AB\u00b2 = ( (AC)/2 )\u00b2 + ( (BD)/2 )\u00b2.\n\nBut from earlier, AB\u00b2 is (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2.\n\nHmm, but maybe I can express AB\u00b2 in terms of AC and BD.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about the sides in terms of vectors.\n\nAlternatively, since we have four points on the hyperbola, perhaps I can find a parametrization for points on the hyperbola and use that.\n\nI know that hyperbolas can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions. So, for the hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a parametrization is (a cosh \u03b8, b sinh \u03b8). But I'm not sure if that's the easiest way here.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the standard parametrization for hyperbola points. For hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, a parametrization could be (sqrt(20) sec \u03b8, sqrt(24) tan \u03b8). But wait, actually, hyperbola parametrization is usually done using hyperbolic functions: x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t. Let me use that.\n\nSo, for point A, we can write A as (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t). Similarly, another point can be parametrized with a different parameter.\n\nBut since the diagonals are perpendicular, maybe there's a relationship between the parameters of the points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that points A and C are (a, b) and (-a, -b), so point A is (a, b), C is (-a, -b). Similarly, points B and D are (c, d) and (-c, -d). So, now, the four points are A(a, b), B(c, d), C(-a, -b), D(-c, -d).\n\nSo, in this case, the rhombus is formed by these four points.\n\nNow, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So, let's compute AB\u00b2 and set it equal to BC\u00b2.\n\nWait, earlier when I computed AB\u00b2 and BC\u00b2, I got the condition ac + bd = 0, which comes from equating AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2.\n\nSo, that's one condition.\n\nAlso, we have that A and B lie on the hyperbola, so:\n\nFor point A: (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nFor point B: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nSo, now, I have three equations:\n\n1) (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\n2) (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\n3) ac + bd =0.\n\nAnd I need to find BD\u00b2 =4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). So, I need to find the maximum lower bound for BD\u00b2, i.e., find the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, in other words, find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi, and then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 would be that infimum.\n\nSo, I need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, given the constraints, and then the answer would be that minimal value. Wait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if the minimal BD\u00b2 is m, then any number less than m would satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But the greatest such number is m itself if m is the infimum. Wait, but if BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to m, but not less than m, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be m. Hmm, I think that's correct.\n\nSo, to find the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), given the constraints.\n\nSo, how can I express c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 in terms of the hyperbola equation?\n\nFrom equation 2, (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nLet me solve for c\u00b2: c\u00b2 = 20(1 + (d\u00b2)/24).\n\nSo, c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 = 20(1 + (d\u00b2)/24) + d\u00b2 = 20 + (20 d\u00b2)/24 + d\u00b2 = 20 + (5 d\u00b2)/6 + d\u00b2 = 20 + (11 d\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 = 20 + (11 d\u00b2)/6.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 1, (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1 => a\u00b2 = 20(1 + (b\u00b2)/24).\n\nSo, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 20(1 + (b\u00b2)/24) + b\u00b2 = 20 + (20 b\u00b2)/24 + b\u00b2 = 20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 + b\u00b2 = 20 + (11 b\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =20 + (11 b\u00b2)/6.\n\nNow, from the condition ac + bd =0.\n\nSo, ac = -bd.\n\nLet me square both sides: a\u00b2 c\u00b2 = b\u00b2 d\u00b2.\n\nBut from above, we have a\u00b2 =20(1 + (b\u00b2)/24) and c\u00b2 =20(1 + (d\u00b2)/24).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n[20(1 + (b\u00b2)/24)] [20(1 + (d\u00b2)/24)] = b\u00b2 d\u00b2.\n\nSo, 400 (1 + (b\u00b2)/24)(1 + (d\u00b2)/24) = b\u00b2 d\u00b2.\n\nLet me denote u = b\u00b2 and v = d\u00b2. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n400 (1 + u/24)(1 + v/24) = u v.\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n400 [1 + u/24 + v/24 + (u v)/(24\u00b2)] = u v.\n\nMultiply through:\n\n400 + (400 u)/24 + (400 v)/24 + (400 u v)/(576) = u v.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n400 + (400/24)u + (400/24)v + (400/576) u v = u v.\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\n400/24 = 50/3 \u224816.6667.\n\n400/576 = 25/36 \u22480.6944.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n400 + (50/3)u + (50/3)v + (25/36) u v = u v.\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side:\n\n400 + (50/3)u + (50/3)v + (25/36) u v - u v =0.\n\nCombine the u v terms:\n\n(25/36 - 1) u v = (-11/36) u v.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n400 + (50/3)(u + v) - (11/36) u v =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 36 to eliminate denominators:\n\n36*400 + 50*12*(u + v) -11 u v =0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n36*400 = 14400.\n\n50*12=600. So, 600(u + v).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n14400 + 600(u + v) -11 u v =0.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n-11 u v +600 u +600 v +14400=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by (-1):\n\n11 u v -600 u -600 v -14400=0.\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic in u and v.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this as:\n\n11 u v -600 u -600 v =14400.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but maybe I can factor it.\n\nLet me try to write this as:\n\n11 u v -600 u -600 v =14400.\n\nLet me add 600\u00b2/(11) to both sides to complete the rectangle, but this might get messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set variables p = u + k and q = v + l to eliminate the linear terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider u and v as variables and solve for one in terms of the other.\n\nLet me try to solve for u in terms of v.\n\nFrom equation:\n\n11 u v -600 u -600 v =14400.\n\nLet me factor u:\n\nu (11 v -600) -600 v =14400.\n\nThen,\n\nu (11 v -600) =600 v +14400.\n\nSo,\n\nu = (600 v +14400)/(11 v -600).\n\nHmm, that might be useful.\n\nSo, u is expressed in terms of v.\n\nSimilarly, since u = b\u00b2 and v = d\u00b2, which are squares, they must be non-negative.\n\nMoreover, from the hyperbola equation, for point B: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1 => c\u00b2 =20(1 + d\u00b2/24). So, c\u00b2 must be positive, which is always true.\n\nSimilarly, for point A: a\u00b2 =20(1 + b\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, u and v must be such that 11 v -600 is not zero, so v \u2260600/11 \u224854.545.\n\nBut since u and v are squares, they are non-negative, so we need 11 v -600 \u22600.\n\nSo, if 11 v -600 is positive, then u is positive, which is acceptable.\n\nIf 11 v -600 is negative, then the numerator must also be negative to have u positive.\n\nLet me see: 600 v +14400.\n\nIf 11 v -600 <0, then v <600/11\u224854.545.\n\nThen, 600 v +14400 is positive since v is non-negative.\n\nSo, u would be negative, which is not possible because u =b\u00b2 \u22650.\n\nTherefore, 11 v -600 must be positive, so v >600/11\u224854.545.\n\nSo, v must be greater than 54.545.\n\nSimilarly, since u = (600 v +14400)/(11 v -600), and u must be positive, as v >600/11.\n\nSo, now, we can express c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 in terms of v.\n\nEarlier, we had c\u00b2 + d\u00b2=20 + (11 d\u00b2)/6=20 + (11 v)/6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2)=4*(20 + (11 v)/6)=80 + (44 v)/6=80 + (22 v)/3.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 + (22 v)/3.\n\nSo, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize v, given the constraints.\n\nSince v must be greater than 600/11\u224854.545, the minimal v is just above 54.545.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a minimal v beyond which the points can't lie on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, but let me check: as v approaches 600/11 from above, what happens to u?\n\nu=(600 v +14400)/(11 v -600).\n\nLet me compute the limit as v approaches 600/11 from above.\n\nLet me set v =600/11 + \u03b5, where \u03b5 approaches 0+.\n\nSo,\n\nu=(600*(600/11 + \u03b5) +14400)/(11*(600/11 + \u03b5) -600).\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n11*(600/11) +11 \u03b5 -600=600 +11 \u03b5 -600=11 \u03b5.\n\nNumerator:\n\n600*(600/11) +600 \u03b5 +14400.\n\nCompute 600*(600/11)= (600^2)/11=360000/11\u224832727.27.\n\nSo, numerator\u224832727.27 +600 \u03b5 +14400=47127.27 +600 \u03b5.\n\nSo, u\u2248(47127.27 +600 \u03b5)/(11 \u03b5).\n\nAs \u03b5 approaches 0+, u approaches infinity.\n\nSo, u becomes very large as v approaches 600/11 from above.\n\nSimilarly, if I let v approach infinity, what happens to u?\n\nu=(600 v +14400)/(11 v -600)\u2248(600 v)/(11 v)=600/11\u224854.545.\n\nSo, as v increases, u approaches 600/11.\n\nSo, the minimal v is just above 600/11, but u approaches infinity as v approaches 600/11 from above.\n\nWait, but that suggests that BD\u00b2=80 + (22 v)/3, which as v approaches 600/11 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches 80 + (22*(600/11))/3=80 + (1200/3)=80 +400=480.\n\nWait, so as v approaches 600/11 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut can BD\u00b2 be exactly 480?\n\nWait, because when v=600/11, the denominator becomes zero, which is undefined, so v must be greater than 600/11, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nSimilarly, when v is very large, u approaches 600/11, and BD\u00b2=80 + (22 v)/3 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is approaching 480, but can't actually reach it.\n\nSo, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, meaning that BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 but never less than that.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if BD\u00b2 can approach 480 but never be less than 480, then 480 is the infimum, and the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480.\n\nWait, but no, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, since 480 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, and any number greater than 480 would not satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi (since BD\u00b2 can be just above 480).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if the infimum is 480, then the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let me suppose that BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as we like. So, for any \u03b5>0, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 <480 + \u03b5. Therefore, the infimum is 480. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the infimum is 480, then for any number less than 480, say 479, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than 479. So, that can't be. Wait, no, actually, if the infimum is 480, then BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired from above, but never less than 480. So, 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480. So, the answer is 480.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations. I found that BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as v approaches 600/11 from above. So, BD\u00b2 can be as close to 480 as we want, but not less than 480. So, 480 is the infimum.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we consider the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\) and a rhombus \\( ABCD \\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Points \\( A, B, C, D \\) lie on the hyperbola, and the diagonals \\( AC \\) and \\( BD \\) are perpendicular. \n\n1. **Hyperbola Equations**: For points \\( A(a, b) \\) and \\( B(c, d) \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a^2}{20} - \\frac{b^2}{24} = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{c^2}{20} - \\frac{d^2}{24} = 1.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Perpendicular Diagonals**: The condition \\( ac + bd = 0 \\) arises from the diagonals being perpendicular.\n\n3. **BD\u00b2 Expression**: The length of diagonal \\( BD \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = 4(c^2 + d^2).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Minimizing BD\u00b2**: Using the hyperbola equations and the condition \\( ac + bd = 0 \\), we express \\( c^2 + d^2 \\) in terms of \\( d^2 \\) and find that:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = 80 + \\frac{22v}{3},\n   \\]\n   where \\( v = d^2 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. But wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, no, wait. I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, that's a square. No, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, I'm confused now. Let me double-check. Oh, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. So, perhaps in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular. Wait, no, I think I'm wrong. Wait, I recall that in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular. Hmm, maybe I should look it up, but since I can't right now, maybe I can figure it out.\n\nWait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Because the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at 90 degrees, making four right triangles. So, yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So that's a key property.\n\nSo, in this problem, the rhombus ABCD has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD. Therefore, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y), since the midpoint is the origin. Similarly, points B and D must be such that their midpoint is the origin as well. So, if point B is (p, q), then point D is (-p, -q).\n\nSo, all four points are A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), D(-p, -q). And all these points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the lengths of AB, BC, CD, and DA are equal. So, let's express the distance between A and B, and set it equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Since the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, we can use the slopes of the diagonals to be negative reciprocals. So, if diagonal AC has a slope m, then diagonal BD should have a slope of -1/m.\n\nBut since AC is from (x, y) to (-x, -y), the slope of AC is ( -y - y ) / ( -x - x ) = (-2y)/(-2x) = y/x. Therefore, the slope of BD should be -x/y.\n\nBut BD is from (p, q) to (-p, -q), so the slope is (-q - q)/(-p - p) = (-2q)/(-2p) = q/p. So, q/p must equal -x/y. Therefore, q/p = -x/y, so q = (-x/y)p.\n\nSo, this gives a relationship between the coordinates of points B and D and points A and C. So, if I can express q in terms of p, x, and y, that might help.\n\nNow, since points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, for point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, for point B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nBut from earlier, we have q = (-x/y)p. So, substituting into point B's equation: p\u00b2/20 - [ (-x/y p)\u00b2 ] /24 = 1. Simplify that:\n\np\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2/y\u00b2 * p\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nFactor out p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me write that as:\n\np\u00b2 [ (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2) / (20 * 24 y\u00b2) ) ] = 1.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2):\n\n= (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2) / (20 * 24 y\u00b2).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 * (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2)/(20*24 y\u00b2) ) = 1.\n\nTherefore, p\u00b2 = (20 * 24 y\u00b2) / (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2).\n\nHmm, let me compute the denominator:\n\n24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2 = 4*(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2).\n\nHmm, not sure if that's useful yet.\n\nWait, but point A is on the hyperbola, so x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. Let's solve for y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2 = (24)(x\u00b2/20 -1) = (24)(x\u00b2 -20)/20 = (6)(x\u00b2 -20)/5.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = (6x\u00b2 - 120)/5.\n\nSo, substituting back into the expression for p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 = (20 * 24 y\u00b2) / (24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2).\n\nBut let's compute the numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 20*24 y\u00b2 = 480 y\u00b2.\n\nDenominator: 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 = 4*(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2).\n\nBut from point A's equation, we have x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, which can be rewritten as 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 = 20*24*1? Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. Multiply both sides by 20*24=480:\n\n24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 =480.\n\nSo, 24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 =480.\n\nHmm, but in the denominator, we have 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2. Let me factor that:\n\n24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 = - (20 x\u00b2 -24 y\u00b2) = - (20 x\u00b2 -24 y\u00b2).\n\nBut from the hyperbola equation, 24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 =480.\n\nSo, 20 x\u00b2 -24 y\u00b2 = - (24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 +40 y\u00b2 -40 y\u00b2) Wait, maybe not the best approach.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nFrom the hyperbola equation: 24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 =480.\n\nSo, 20 x\u00b2 = (24 x\u00b2 -480)/1. So, 20 x\u00b2 =24 x\u00b2 -480.\n\nSo, 24 x\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 =480 \u2192 4x\u00b2=480 \u2192x\u00b2=120. Wait, that can't be right because if I rearrange 24x\u00b2 -20y\u00b2=480, that's 12x\u00b2 -10y\u00b2=240.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 in terms of the hyperbola equation.\n\nWe have 24x\u00b2 -20y\u00b2=480.\n\nSo, 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 = - (20x\u00b2 -24 y\u00b2) = - (something).\n\nBut 20x\u00b2 -24 y\u00b2 = ?\n\nWait, from the hyperbola equation, 24x\u00b2 -20y\u00b2=480. Let's solve for 20x\u00b2:\n\n20x\u00b2 = (24x\u00b2 -480)/1. So, 20x\u00b2 =24x\u00b2 -480 \u2192 24x\u00b2 -20x\u00b2=480 \u21924x\u00b2=480\u2192x\u00b2=120.\n\nWait, that would imply x\u00b2 is fixed at 120? But that can't be, because the hyperbola equation allows x\u00b2 to vary as long as y\u00b2 is adjusted accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, so 24x\u00b2 -20y\u00b2=480.\n\nSo, 24x\u00b2 -20y\u00b2=480.\n\nSo, 24x\u00b2=480 +20y\u00b2.\n\nSo, 24y\u00b2 -20x\u00b2=24y\u00b2 -20x\u00b2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express 24y\u00b2 -20x\u00b2 in terms of the hyperbola equation.\n\nWait, 24y\u00b2 -20x\u00b2 = - (20x\u00b2 -24y\u00b2).\n\nFrom the hyperbola equation, 24x\u00b2 -20y\u00b2=480.\n\nHmm, maybe that's not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express 24y\u00b2 in terms of x\u00b2.\n\nFrom the hyperbola equation, 24x\u00b2 -20y\u00b2=480 \u219220y\u00b2=24x\u00b2 -480\u2192 y\u00b2=(24x\u00b2 -480)/20= (6x\u00b2 -120)/5.\n\nSo, y\u00b2=(6x\u00b2 -120)/5.\n\nSo, plugging back into 24y\u00b2 -20x\u00b2:\n\n24*(6x\u00b2 -120)/5 -20x\u00b2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n= (144x\u00b2 - 2880)/5 -20x\u00b2.\n\nConvert 20x\u00b2 to 100x\u00b2/5:\n\n= (144x\u00b2 -2880 -100x\u00b2)/5.\n\n= (44x\u00b2 -2880)/5.\n\nSo, denominator= (44x\u00b2 -2880)/5.\n\nSo, going back to p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2=480 y\u00b2 / denominator.\n\nBut y\u00b2=(6x\u00b2 -120)/5, so:\n\np\u00b2=480*(6x\u00b2 -120)/5 / [ (44x\u00b2 -2880)/5 ].\n\nThe denominators 5 cancel out:\n\np\u00b2=480*(6x\u00b2 -120) / (44x\u00b2 -2880).\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 480*(6x\u00b2 -120)=480*6*(x\u00b2 -20)=2880*(x\u00b2 -20).\n\nDenominator:44x\u00b2 -2880=4*(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nSo, p\u00b2=2880*(x\u00b2 -20) / [4*(11x\u00b2 -720)].\n\nSimplify 2880/4=720.\n\nSo, p\u00b2=720*(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nHmm, interesting. So, p\u00b2 is expressed in terms of x\u00b2.\n\nNow, since p\u00b2 must be positive, the numerator and denominator must have the same sign.\n\nSo, both numerator and denominator are positive or both negative.\n\nSo, (x\u00b2 -20) and (11x\u00b2 -720) must have the same sign.\n\nSo, let's find the critical points where each factor is zero.\n\nx\u00b2 -20=0 \u2192x\u00b2=20.\n\n11x\u00b2 -720=0 \u2192x\u00b2=720/11\u224865.45.\n\nSo, when x\u00b2<20, both numerator and denominator are negative: x\u00b2-20 <0, 11x\u00b2-720 <0. So, their ratio is positive.\n\nWhen x\u00b2 is between 20 and 720/11\u224865.45, numerator is positive (x\u00b2-20>0), denominator is negative (11x\u00b2 -720 <0), so ratio is negative.\n\nWhen x\u00b2>720/11\u224865.45, both numerator and denominator are positive, so ratio is positive.\n\nBut p\u00b2 must be positive, so p\u00b2 is positive when x\u00b2 <20 or x\u00b2>720/11.\n\nBut x\u00b2 cannot be less than 20 because on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1, so x\u00b2 must be at least 20, right? Because for the hyperbola, x\u00b2 \u226520.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 >=20. So, the case when x\u00b2 <20 is impossible. Therefore, p\u00b2 is positive only when x\u00b2>720/11\u224865.45.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 must be greater than 720/11.\n\nSo, that's an important point.\n\nSo, x\u00b2>720/11\u224865.45.\n\nNow, so p\u00b2=720*(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nLet me write that as:\n\np\u00b2=720*(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nI can factor 720 and 11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:720*(x\u00b2 -20).\n\nDenominator:11x\u00b2 -720=11(x\u00b2 - 720/11).\n\nSo, p\u00b2= [720/(11)] * (x\u00b2 -20)/(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as:\n\np\u00b2= [720/11] * [ (x\u00b2 -20) / (x\u00b2 -720/11) ].\n\nSo, let me denote t = x\u00b2.\n\nSo, t >=20, and for p\u00b2 to be positive, t>720/11\u224865.45.\n\nSo, p\u00b2= [720/11] * [ (t -20)/(t -720/11) ].\n\nLet me compute (t -20)/(t -720/11):\n\n= [t -20]/[t - (720/11)].\n\n= [t -20]/[t -65.4545...].\n\nSo, that's (t -20)/(t -65.4545).\n\nSo, p\u00b2= (720/11) * (t -20)/(t -65.4545).\n\nHmm, I can write this as:\n\np\u00b2= (720/11) * [1 + (45.4545)/(t -65.4545)].\n\nWait, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this as:\n\n(t -20)/(t -720/11)=1 - (720/11 -20)/(t -720/11).\n\nCompute 720/11 -20=720/11 -220/11=(720-220)/11=500/11.\n\nSo, (t -20)/(t -720/11)=1 - (500/11)/(t -720/11).\n\nTherefore, p\u00b2= (720/11) [1 - (500/11)/(t -720/11) ].\n\nSo, p\u00b2=720/11 - (720/11)*(500/11)/(t -720/11).\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\n(720*500)/(11*11*(t -720/11)).\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if this is helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express p\u00b2 in terms of t, and then find BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, BD is the diagonal from B(p, q) to D(-p, -q), so its length squared is (2p)^2 + (2q)^2=4p\u00b2 +4q\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, AC is from A(x,y) to C(-x,-y), so AC\u00b2=4(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nBut in a rhombus, the area is (AC * BD)/2. Wait, but maybe that's not directly helpful here.\n\nWait, but since the rhombus has perpendicular diagonals, the area is (AC * BD)/2. So, that might come into play, but perhaps not immediately.\n\nBut perhaps I can express BD\u00b2 in terms of p\u00b2 and q\u00b2.\n\nWe have BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nBut from point B(p, q), which is on the hyperbola, p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2=20(1 + q\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, p\u00b2=20 + (20 q\u00b2)/24=20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6 + q\u00b2=20 + (11 q\u00b2)/6.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2=4*(20 + (11 q\u00b2)/6 )= 80 + (44 q\u00b2)/6=80 + (22 q\u00b2)/3.\n\nHmm, that's another expression for BD\u00b2.\n\nBut since q is related to p via q = (-x/y) p, as we found earlier.\n\nSo, q = (-x/y) p.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = (x\u00b2/y\u00b2) p\u00b2.\n\nSo, substituting into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2=80 + (22/3)*(x\u00b2/y\u00b2) p\u00b2.\n\nBut we have an expression for p\u00b2 in terms of x\u00b2, which is p\u00b2=720*(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nAnd from the hyperbola, y\u00b2=(6x\u00b2 -120)/5.\n\nSo, x\u00b2/y\u00b2= x\u00b2 / [ (6x\u00b2 -120)/5 ]=5x\u00b2/(6x\u00b2 -120)=5x\u00b2/[6(x\u00b2 -20)].\n\nSo, x\u00b2/y\u00b2=5x\u00b2/(6(x\u00b2 -20)).\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3)*(5x\u00b2/(6(x\u00b2 -20)))*p\u00b2.\n\nSubstituting p\u00b2=720*(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3)*(5x\u00b2/(6(x\u00b2 -20)))*(720*(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720)).\n\nSimplify this expression step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute the constants:\n\n22/3 * 5x\u00b2/(6(x\u00b2 -20)) *720*(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nSimplify each part:\n\n22/3 *5x\u00b2/(6(x\u00b2 -20)) *720*(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nFirst, note that (x\u00b2 -20) cancels out in numerator and denominator.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n22/3 *5x\u00b2/6 *720/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nCompute the numerical factors:\n\n22/3 *5/6 *720.\n\nCompute 22/3 *5/6= (22*5)/(3*6)=110/18=55/9.\n\nThen, 55/9 *720=55*(720/9)=55*80=4400.\n\nSo, the numerical factor is 4400.\n\nNow, the x\u00b2 terms:\n\nx\u00b2 remains as x\u00b2.\n\nDenominator:11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nBD\u00b2=80 + (4400 x\u00b2)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 + [4400 x\u00b2 / (11x\u00b2 -720)].\n\nHmm, that's a manageable expression.\n\nNow, let me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=80 + [4400 x\u00b2 / (11x\u00b2 -720)].\n\nI can factor out 11 from the denominator:\n\n11x\u00b2 -720=11(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 + [4400 x\u00b2 / (11(x\u00b2 -720/11))].\n\nSimplify 4400/11=400.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 + [400 x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 -720/11)].\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 + 400 x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nHmm, let's write 720/11 as approximately 65.4545, but perhaps I can keep it as a fraction for exactness.\n\nSo, 720/11 is exact.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 + [400 x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 -720/11)].\n\nLet me combine the terms over a common denominator.\n\nExpress 80 as 80*(x\u00b2 -720/11)/(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nSo:\n\nBD\u00b2= [80*(x\u00b2 -720/11) +400 x\u00b2]/(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nCompute the numerator:\n\n80x\u00b2 -80*(720/11) +400x\u00b2.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n80x\u00b2 +400x\u00b2=480x\u00b2.\n\nSo, numerator=480x\u00b2 - (80*720)/11.\n\nCompute 80*720=57,600.\n\nSo, numerator=480x\u00b2 -57,600/11.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2= [480x\u00b2 -57600/11]/(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nHmm, that's another way to write it.\n\nAlternatively, factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:480x\u00b2 -57600/11.\n\nFactor 480: 480=48*10=16*3*10.\n\nBut perhaps factor 480/11:\n\n480x\u00b2=480x\u00b2*(11/11)= (5280x\u00b2)/11.\n\nSo, numerator= (5280x\u00b2 -57600)/11.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= [ (5280x\u00b2 -57600)/11 ] / (x\u00b2 -720/11 ).\n\n= [5280x\u00b2 -57600]/[11(x\u00b2 -720/11)].\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n5280x\u00b2 -57600= 5280(x\u00b2 - 57600/5280).\n\nCompute 57600/5280:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 240: 57600/240=240, 5280/240=22.\n\nSo, 240/22=120/11\u224810.909.\n\nSo, 57600/5280=57600 \u00f7 5280= 57600 \u00f7 5280=10.9090909\u224810.909.\n\nBut exactly, 57600 \u00f7 5280= (57600 \u00f7 240)/(5280 \u00f7240)=240/22=120/11.\n\nSo, numerator=5280(x\u00b2 -120/11).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= [5280(x\u00b2 -120/11)] / [11(x\u00b2 -720/11)].\n\nSimplify:\n\n5280/11=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480(x\u00b2 -120/11)/(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(x\u00b2 -120/11)/(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nHmm, that's a cleaner expression.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(x\u00b2 -120/11)/(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(x\u00b2 -120/11)/(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nNow, to find the maximum of BD\u00b2, or more precisely, the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2 over all permissible x\u00b2.\n\nWait, the question asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that is, the supremum of the lower bounds of BD\u00b2. Wait, no, actually, it's the greatest lower bound. Wait, the problem says: \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2, but phrased as the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, it's the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the opposite. Let me read again: \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of the lower bounds of BD\u00b2. Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nIf we're looking for the largest number that is always less than BD\u00b2, regardless of the rhombus, then that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because the infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, any number less than the infimum would not be a lower bound for all BD\u00b2, but the infimum itself is the largest such number that is less than or equal to all BD\u00b2. But since the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2\", not \"less than or equal\", then the infimum might not be attainable, but it would be the limit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the behavior of BD\u00b2 as x\u00b2 varies.\n\nFrom earlier, we have x\u00b2>720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, let's let t =x\u00b2, where t>720/11.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(t -120/11)/(t -720/11).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(t - a)/(t - b), where a=120/11\u224810.909, b=720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, as t approaches b from above, the denominator approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nAs t approaches infinity, the expression approaches 480*(t)/(t)=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as t\u2192\u221e.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is a function that starts at infinity when t approaches 720/11 from above, and decreases towards 480 as t increases.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 480, but it's approached asymptotically as t increases. So, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 by choosing t sufficiently large. But it never actually reaches 480.\n\nTherefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, since BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, but can get as close as desired to 480.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify that.\n\nWait, when t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut for any finite t, BD\u00b2 is greater than 480.\n\nSo, 480 is the infimum of BD\u00b2. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, when t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above, meaning BD\u00b2 is larger than 480 for all finite t. So, 480 is the lower bound, and the infimum is 480.\n\nBut the problem says, \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be 480, since BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, but can get as close as we like to 480. Therefore, 480 is the greatest lower bound, so the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the expression for BD\u00b2 again.\n\nEarlier, I had BD\u00b2=480*(t -120/11)/(t -720/11).\n\nLet me compute this when t approaches 720/11 from above.\n\nAs t approaches 720/11, denominator approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nAs t increases beyond that, BD\u00b2 decreases and approaches 480 as t\u2192infty.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value BD\u00b2 can approach is 480, but it's never less than 480.\n\nSo, the infimum is 480, which is the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, 480 is the infimum, so any number less than 480 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but 480 itself is not less than BD\u00b2, because BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480.\n\nWait, no. Wait, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, right? Because as t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is greater than 480 for all permissible t.\n\nTherefore, 480 is the infimum, meaning that for any epsilon>0, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 <480 + epsilon.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, that would be 480, since BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, but for any number greater than 480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 less than that number.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf the infimum is 480, then for any number M <480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 <M? No, that can't be, because BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, so any M <480 would not satisfy M < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because for some rhombus, BD\u00b2 could be just above 480, which is less than M if M is less than 480.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, actually, if the infimum is 480, that means BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480. So, for any M <480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 <M is not possible because BD\u00b2 is always >=480. Wait, no, wait: the infimum is 480, which is the greatest lower bound, so BD\u00b2 >=480 for all rhombi.\n\nTherefore, 480 is the minimal value that BD\u00b2 can approach, but never actually reach. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480.\n\nTherefore, any number less than 480 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But the problem asks for the greatest such number. So, that would be 480, because it's the largest number that is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But since BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480? No, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 but never actually reaches it. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480.\n\nTherefore, 480 is the infimum, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check with specific values.\n\nSuppose t is very large, say t=1000.\n\nCompute BD\u00b2=480*(1000 -120/11)/(1000 -720/11).\n\nCompute 120/11\u224810.909, 720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, numerator:1000 -10.909\u2248989.091.\n\nDenominator:1000 -65.4545\u2248934.5455.\n\nSo, 989.091/934.5455\u22481.058.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2\u2248480*1.058\u2248508. So, that's way above 480.\n\nWait, but when t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nWait, another example: t=10,000.\n\nCompute numerator:10,000 -10.909\u22489989.091.\n\nDenominator:10,000 -65.4545\u22489934.5455.\n\nSo, ratio\u22489989.091/9934.5455\u22481.0055.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2\u2248480*1.0055\u2248482.64.\n\nSo, as t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nSo, if I take t=1,000,000:\n\nNumerator\u22481,000,000 -10.909\u2248999,989.091.\n\nDenominator\u22481,000,000 -65.4545\u2248999,934.5455.\n\nRatio\u2248999,989.091/999,934.5455\u22481.000055.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2\u2248480*1.000055\u2248480.0264.\n\nSo, very close to 480.\n\nTherefore, as t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. So, 480 is the infimum, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. But wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, no, wait. I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, that's a square. No, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, I'm confused now. Let me double-check. Oh, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. So, perhaps in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular. Wait, no, I think I'm wrong. Wait, I recall that in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular. Hmm, maybe I should look it up, but since I can't right now, maybe I can figure it out.\n\nWait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Because the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at 90 degrees, making four right triangles. So, yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So that's a key property.\n\nSo, in this problem, the rhombus ABCD has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD. Therefore, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y), since the midpoint is the origin. Similarly, points B and D must be such that their midpoint is the origin as well. So, if point B is (p, q), then point D is (-p, -q).\n\nSo, all four points are A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), D(-p, -q). And all these points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the lengths of AB, BC, CD, and DA are equal. So, let's express the distance between A and B, and set it equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Since the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, we can use the slopes of the diagonals to be negative reciprocals. So, if diagonal AC has a slope m, then diagonal BD should have a slope of -1/m.\n\nBut since AC is from (x, y) to (-x, -y), the slope of AC is ( -y - y ) / ( -x - x ) = (-2y)/(-2x) = y/x. Therefore, the slope of BD should be -x/y.\n\nBut BD is from (p, q) to (-p, -q), so the slope is (-q - q)/(-p - p) = (-2q)/(-2p) = q/p. So, q/p must equal -x/y. Therefore, q/p = -x/y, so q = (-x/y)p.\n\nSo, this gives a relationship between the coordinates of points B and D and points A and C. So, if I can express q in terms of p, x, and y, that might help.\n\nNow, since points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, for point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, for point B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nBut from earlier, we have q = (-x/y)p. So, substituting into point B's equation: p\u00b2/20 - [ (-x/y p)\u00b2 ] /24 = 1. Simplify that:\n\np\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2/y\u00b2 * p\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nFactor out p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [ 1/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) ] = 1.\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me write that as:\n\np\u00b2 [ (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2) / (20 * 24 y\u00b2) ) ] = 1.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2):\n\n= (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2) / (20 * 24 y\u00b2).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 * (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2)/(20*24 y\u00b2) ) = 1.\n\nTherefore, p\u00b2 = (20 * 24 y\u00b2) / (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2).\n\nHmm, let me compute the denominator:\n\n24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2 = 4*(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2).\n\nHmm, not sure if that's useful yet.\n\nWait, but point A is on the hyperbola, so x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. Let's solve for y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2 = (24)(x\u00b2/20 -1) = (24)(x\u00b2 -20)/20 = (6)(x\u00b2 -20)/5.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = (6x\u00b2 - 120)/5.\n\nSo, substituting back into the expression for p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 = (20 * 24 y\u00b2) / (24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2).\n\nBut let's compute the numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 20*24 y\u00b2 = 480 y\u00b2.\n\nDenominator: 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 = 4*(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2).\n\nBut from point A's equation, we have x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, which can be rewritten as 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 = 20*24*1? Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. Multiply both sides by 20*24=480:\n\n24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 =480.\n\nSo, 24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 =480.\n\nHmm, but in the denominator, we have 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2. Let me factor that:\n\n24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 = - (20 x\u00b2 -24 y\u00b2) = - (20 x\u00b2 -24 y\u00b2).\n\nBut from the hyperbola equation, 24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 =480.\n\nSo, 20 x\u00b2 -24 y\u00b2 = - (24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 +40 y\u00b2 -40 y\u00b2) Wait, maybe not the best approach.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nFrom the hyperbola equation: 24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 =480.\n\nSo, 20 x\u00b2 = (24 x\u00b2 -480)/1. So, 20 x\u00b2 =24 x\u00b2 -480.\n\nSo, 24 x\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 =480 \u2192 4x\u00b2=480 \u2192x\u00b2=120. Wait, that can't be right because if I rearrange 24x\u00b2 -20y\u00b2=480, that's 12x\u00b2 -10y\u00b2=240.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 in terms of the hyperbola equation.\n\nWe have 24x\u00b2 -20y\u00b2=480.\n\nSo, 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 = - (20x\u00b2 -24 y\u00b2) = - (something).\n\nBut 20x\u00b2 -24 y\u00b2 = ?\n\nWait, from the hyperbola equation, 24x\u00b2 -20y\u00b2=480. Let's solve for 20x\u00b2:\n\n20x\u00b2 = (24x\u00b2 -480)/1. So, 20x\u00b2 =24x\u00b2 -480 \u2192 24x\u00b2 -20x\u00b2=480 \u21924x\u00b2=480\u2192x\u00b2=120.\n\nWait, that would imply x\u00b2 is fixed at 120? But that can't be, because the hyperbola equation allows x\u00b2 to vary as long as y\u00b2 is adjusted accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, so 24x\u00b2 -20y\u00b2=480.\n\nSo, 24x\u00b2 -20y\u00b2=480.\n\nSo, 24x\u00b2=480 +20y\u00b2.\n\nSo, 24y\u00b2 -20x\u00b2=24y\u00b2 -20x\u00b2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express 24y\u00b2 -20x\u00b2 in terms of the hyperbola equation.\n\nWait, 24y\u00b2 -20x\u00b2 = - (20x\u00b2 -24y\u00b2).\n\nFrom the hyperbola equation, 24x\u00b2 -20y\u00b2=480.\n\nHmm, maybe that's not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express 24y\u00b2 in terms of x\u00b2.\n\nFrom the hyperbola equation, 24x\u00b2 -20y\u00b2=480 \u219220y\u00b2=24x\u00b2 -480\u2192 y\u00b2=(24x\u00b2 -480)/20= (6x\u00b2 -120)/5.\n\nSo, y\u00b2=(6x\u00b2 -120)/5.\n\nSo, plugging back into 24y\u00b2 -20x\u00b2:\n\n24*(6x\u00b2 -120)/5 -20x\u00b2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n= (144x\u00b2 - 2880)/5 -20x\u00b2.\n\nConvert 20x\u00b2 to 100x\u00b2/5:\n\n= (144x\u00b2 -2880 -100x\u00b2)/5.\n\n= (44x\u00b2 -2880)/5.\n\nSo, denominator= (44x\u00b2 -2880)/5.\n\nSo, going back to p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2=480 y\u00b2 / denominator.\n\nBut y\u00b2=(6x\u00b2 -120)/5, so:\n\np\u00b2=480*(6x\u00b2 -120)/5 / [ (44x\u00b2 -2880)/5 ].\n\nThe denominators 5 cancel out:\n\np\u00b2=480*(6x\u00b2 -120) / (44x\u00b2 -2880).\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 480*(6x\u00b2 -120)=480*6*(x\u00b2 -20)=2880*(x\u00b2 -20).\n\nDenominator:44x\u00b2 -2880=4*(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nSo, p\u00b2=2880*(x\u00b2 -20) / [4*(11x\u00b2 -720)].\n\nSimplify 2880/4=720.\n\nSo, p\u00b2=720*(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nHmm, interesting. So, p\u00b2 is expressed in terms of x\u00b2.\n\nNow, since p\u00b2 must be positive, the numerator and denominator must have the same sign.\n\nSo, both numerator and denominator are positive or both negative.\n\nSo, (x\u00b2 -20) and (11x\u00b2 -720) must have the same sign.\n\nSo, let's find the critical points where each factor is zero.\n\nx\u00b2 -20=0 \u2192x\u00b2=20.\n\n11x\u00b2 -720=0 \u2192x\u00b2=720/11\u224865.45.\n\nSo, when x\u00b2<20, both numerator and denominator are negative: x\u00b2-20 <0, 11x\u00b2-720 <0. So, their ratio is positive.\n\nWhen x\u00b2 is between 20 and 720/11\u224865.45, numerator is positive (x\u00b2-20>0), denominator is negative (11x\u00b2 -720 <0), so ratio is negative.\n\nWhen x\u00b2>720/11\u224865.45, both numerator and denominator are positive, so ratio is positive.\n\nBut p\u00b2 must be positive, so p\u00b2 is positive when x\u00b2 <20 or x\u00b2>720/11.\n\nBut x\u00b2 cannot be less than 20 because on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1, so x\u00b2 must be at least 20, right? Because for the hyperbola, x\u00b2 \u226520.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 >=20. So, the case when x\u00b2 <20 is impossible. Therefore, p\u00b2 is positive only when x\u00b2>720/11\u224865.45.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 must be greater than 720/11.\n\nSo, that's an important point.\n\nSo, x\u00b2>720/11\u224865.45.\n\nNow, so p\u00b2=720*(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nLet me write that as:\n\np\u00b2=720*(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nI can factor 720 and 11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:720*(x\u00b2 -20).\n\nDenominator:11x\u00b2 -720=11(x\u00b2 - 720/11).\n\nSo, p\u00b2= [720/(11)] * (x\u00b2 -20)/(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as:\n\np\u00b2= [720/11] * [ (x\u00b2 -20) / (x\u00b2 -720/11) ].\n\nSo, let me denote t = x\u00b2.\n\nSo, t >=20, and for p\u00b2 to be positive, t>720/11\u224865.45.\n\nSo, p\u00b2= [720/11] * [ (t -20)/(t -720/11) ].\n\nLet me compute (t -20)/(t -720/11):\n\n= [t -20]/[t - (720/11)].\n\n= [t -20]/[t -65.4545...].\n\nSo, that's (t -20)/(t -65.4545).\n\nSo, p\u00b2= (720/11) * (t -20)/(t -65.4545).\n\nHmm, I can write this as:\n\np\u00b2= (720/11) * [1 + (45.4545)/(t -65.4545)].\n\nWait, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this as:\n\n(t -20)/(t -720/11)=1 - (720/11 -20)/(t -720/11).\n\nCompute 720/11 -20=720/11 -220/11=(720-220)/11=500/11.\n\nSo, (t -20)/(t -720/11)=1 - (500/11)/(t -720/11).\n\nTherefore, p\u00b2= (720/11) [1 - (500/11)/(t -720/11) ].\n\nSo, p\u00b2=720/11 - (720/11)*(500/11)/(t -720/11).\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\n(720*500)/(11*11*(t -720/11)).\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if this is helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express p\u00b2 in terms of t, and then find BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, BD is the diagonal from B(p, q) to D(-p, -q), so its length squared is (2p)^2 + (2q)^2=4p\u00b2 +4q\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, AC is from A(x,y) to C(-x,-y), so AC\u00b2=4(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nBut in a rhombus, the area is (AC * BD)/2. Wait, but maybe that's not directly helpful here.\n\nWait, but since the rhombus has perpendicular diagonals, the area is (AC * BD)/2. So, that might come into play, but perhaps not immediately.\n\nBut perhaps I can express BD\u00b2 in terms of p\u00b2 and q\u00b2.\n\nWe have BD\u00b2=4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nBut from point B(p, q), which is on the hyperbola, p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo, p\u00b2=20(1 + q\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, p\u00b2=20 + (20 q\u00b2)/24=20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6 + q\u00b2=20 + (11 q\u00b2)/6.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2=4*(20 + (11 q\u00b2)/6 )= 80 + (44 q\u00b2)/6=80 + (22 q\u00b2)/3.\n\nHmm, that's another expression for BD\u00b2.\n\nBut since q is related to p via q = (-x/y) p, as we found earlier.\n\nSo, q = (-x/y) p.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = (x\u00b2/y\u00b2) p\u00b2.\n\nSo, substituting into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2=80 + (22/3)*(x\u00b2/y\u00b2) p\u00b2.\n\nBut we have an expression for p\u00b2 in terms of x\u00b2, which is p\u00b2=720*(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nAnd from the hyperbola, y\u00b2=(6x\u00b2 -120)/5.\n\nSo, x\u00b2/y\u00b2= x\u00b2 / [ (6x\u00b2 -120)/5 ]=5x\u00b2/(6x\u00b2 -120)=5x\u00b2/[6(x\u00b2 -20)].\n\nSo, x\u00b2/y\u00b2=5x\u00b2/(6(x\u00b2 -20)).\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3)*(5x\u00b2/(6(x\u00b2 -20)))*p\u00b2.\n\nSubstituting p\u00b2=720*(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 + (22/3)*(5x\u00b2/(6(x\u00b2 -20)))*(720*(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720)).\n\nSimplify this expression step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute the constants:\n\n22/3 * 5x\u00b2/(6(x\u00b2 -20)) *720*(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nSimplify each part:\n\n22/3 *5x\u00b2/(6(x\u00b2 -20)) *720*(x\u00b2 -20)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nFirst, note that (x\u00b2 -20) cancels out in numerator and denominator.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n22/3 *5x\u00b2/6 *720/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nCompute the numerical factors:\n\n22/3 *5/6 *720.\n\nCompute 22/3 *5/6= (22*5)/(3*6)=110/18=55/9.\n\nThen, 55/9 *720=55*(720/9)=55*80=4400.\n\nSo, the numerical factor is 4400.\n\nNow, the x\u00b2 terms:\n\nx\u00b2 remains as x\u00b2.\n\nDenominator:11x\u00b2 -720.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nBD\u00b2=80 + (4400 x\u00b2)/(11x\u00b2 -720).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 + [4400 x\u00b2 / (11x\u00b2 -720)].\n\nHmm, that's a manageable expression.\n\nNow, let me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=80 + [4400 x\u00b2 / (11x\u00b2 -720)].\n\nI can factor out 11 from the denominator:\n\n11x\u00b2 -720=11(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 + [4400 x\u00b2 / (11(x\u00b2 -720/11))].\n\nSimplify 4400/11=400.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 + [400 x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 -720/11)].\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 + 400 x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nHmm, let's write 720/11 as approximately 65.4545, but perhaps I can keep it as a fraction for exactness.\n\nSo, 720/11 is exact.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 + [400 x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 -720/11)].\n\nLet me combine the terms over a common denominator.\n\nExpress 80 as 80*(x\u00b2 -720/11)/(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nSo:\n\nBD\u00b2= [80*(x\u00b2 -720/11) +400 x\u00b2]/(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nCompute the numerator:\n\n80x\u00b2 -80*(720/11) +400x\u00b2.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n80x\u00b2 +400x\u00b2=480x\u00b2.\n\nSo, numerator=480x\u00b2 - (80*720)/11.\n\nCompute 80*720=57,600.\n\nSo, numerator=480x\u00b2 -57,600/11.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2= [480x\u00b2 -57600/11]/(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nHmm, that's another way to write it.\n\nAlternatively, factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:480x\u00b2 -57600/11.\n\nFactor 480: 480=48*10=16*3*10.\n\nBut perhaps factor 480/11:\n\n480x\u00b2=480x\u00b2*(11/11)= (5280x\u00b2)/11.\n\nSo, numerator= (5280x\u00b2 -57600)/11.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= [ (5280x\u00b2 -57600)/11 ] / (x\u00b2 -720/11 ).\n\n= [5280x\u00b2 -57600]/[11(x\u00b2 -720/11)].\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n5280x\u00b2 -57600= 5280(x\u00b2 - 57600/5280).\n\nCompute 57600/5280:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 240: 57600/240=240, 5280/240=22.\n\nSo, 240/22=120/11\u224810.909.\n\nSo, 57600/5280=57600 \u00f7 5280= 57600 \u00f7 5280=10.9090909\u224810.909.\n\nBut exactly, 57600 \u00f7 5280= (57600 \u00f7 240)/(5280 \u00f7240)=240/22=120/11.\n\nSo, numerator=5280(x\u00b2 -120/11).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= [5280(x\u00b2 -120/11)] / [11(x\u00b2 -720/11)].\n\nSimplify:\n\n5280/11=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480(x\u00b2 -120/11)/(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(x\u00b2 -120/11)/(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nHmm, that's a cleaner expression.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(x\u00b2 -120/11)/(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(x\u00b2 -120/11)/(x\u00b2 -720/11).\n\nNow, to find the maximum of BD\u00b2, or more precisely, the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2 over all permissible x\u00b2.\n\nWait, the question asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that is, the supremum of the lower bounds of BD\u00b2. Wait, no, actually, it's the greatest lower bound. Wait, the problem says: \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2, but phrased as the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, it's the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the opposite. Let me read again: \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of the lower bounds of BD\u00b2. Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nIf we're looking for the largest number that is always less than BD\u00b2, regardless of the rhombus, then that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because the infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, any number less than the infimum would not be a lower bound for all BD\u00b2, but the infimum itself is the largest such number that is less than or equal to all BD\u00b2. But since the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2\", not \"less than or equal\", then the infimum might not be attainable, but it would be the limit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the behavior of BD\u00b2 as x\u00b2 varies.\n\nFrom earlier, we have x\u00b2>720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, let's let t =x\u00b2, where t>720/11.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(t -120/11)/(t -720/11).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(t - a)/(t - b), where a=120/11\u224810.909, b=720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, as t approaches b from above, the denominator approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nAs t approaches infinity, the expression approaches 480*(t)/(t)=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as t\u2192\u221e.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is a function that starts at infinity when t approaches 720/11 from above, and decreases towards 480 as t increases.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 480, but it's approached asymptotically as t increases. So, BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480 by choosing t sufficiently large. But it never actually reaches 480.\n\nTherefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, since BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, but can get as close as desired to 480.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify that.\n\nWait, when t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut for any finite t, BD\u00b2 is greater than 480.\n\nSo, 480 is the infimum of BD\u00b2. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, when t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above, meaning BD\u00b2 is larger than 480 for all finite t. So, 480 is the lower bound, and the infimum is 480.\n\nBut the problem says, \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be 480, since BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, but can get as close as we like to 480. Therefore, 480 is the greatest lower bound, so the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the expression for BD\u00b2 again.\n\nEarlier, I had BD\u00b2=480*(t -120/11)/(t -720/11).\n\nLet me compute this when t approaches 720/11 from above.\n\nAs t approaches 720/11, denominator approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nAs t increases beyond that, BD\u00b2 decreases and approaches 480 as t\u2192infty.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value BD\u00b2 can approach is 480, but it's never less than 480.\n\nSo, the infimum is 480, which is the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, 480 is the infimum, so any number less than 480 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but 480 itself is not less than BD\u00b2, because BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480.\n\nWait, no. Wait, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, right? Because as t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is greater than 480 for all permissible t.\n\nTherefore, 480 is the infimum, meaning that for any epsilon>0, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 <480 + epsilon.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, that would be 480, since BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, but for any number greater than 480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 less than that number.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf the infimum is 480, then for any number M <480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 <M? No, that can't be, because BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, so any M <480 would not satisfy M < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because for some rhombus, BD\u00b2 could be just above 480, which is less than M if M is less than 480.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, actually, if the infimum is 480, that means BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480. So, for any M <480, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 <M is not possible because BD\u00b2 is always >=480. Wait, no, wait: the infimum is 480, which is the greatest lower bound, so BD\u00b2 >=480 for all rhombi.\n\nTherefore, 480 is the minimal value that BD\u00b2 can approach, but never actually reach. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480.\n\nTherefore, any number less than 480 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But the problem asks for the greatest such number. So, that would be 480, because it's the largest number that is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. But since BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 480? No, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 but never actually reaches it. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480.\n\nTherefore, 480 is the infimum, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check with specific values.\n\nSuppose t is very large, say t=1000.\n\nCompute BD\u00b2=480*(1000 -120/11)/(1000 -720/11).\n\nCompute 120/11\u224810.909, 720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nSo, numerator:1000 -10.909\u2248989.091.\n\nDenominator:1000 -65.4545\u2248934.5455.\n\nSo, 989.091/934.5455\u22481.058.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2\u2248480*1.058\u2248508. So, that's way above 480.\n\nWait, but when t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nWait, another example: t=10,000.\n\nCompute numerator:10,000 -10.909\u22489989.091.\n\nDenominator:10,000 -65.4545\u22489934.5455.\n\nSo, ratio\u22489989.091/9934.5455\u22481.0055.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2\u2248480*1.0055\u2248482.64.\n\nSo, as t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above.\n\nSo, if I take t=1,000,000:\n\nNumerator\u22481,000,000 -10.909\u2248999,989.091.\n\nDenominator\u22481,000,000 -65.4545\u2248999,934.5455.\n\nRatio\u2248999,989.091/999,934.5455\u22481.000055.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2\u2248480*1.000055\u2248480.0264.\n\nSo, very close to 480.\n\nTherefore, as t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. So, 480 is the infimum, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus \\(ABCD\\) on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) are perpendicular, and their midpoints are at the origin. Points \\(A(x, y)\\), \\(B(p, q)\\), \\(C(-x, -y)\\), and \\(D(-p, -q)\\) lie on the hyperbola.\n\nUsing the properties of the rhombus and the hyperbola, we derive expressions for \\(BD^2\\) in terms of \\(x^2\\). Through algebraic manipulation and analysis, we find that \\(BD^2\\) approaches 480 as \\(x^2\\) becomes very large. Since \\(BD^2\\) is always greater than 480 for all permissible values of \\(x^2\\), the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is \\(\\boxed{480}\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{480}\\)",
