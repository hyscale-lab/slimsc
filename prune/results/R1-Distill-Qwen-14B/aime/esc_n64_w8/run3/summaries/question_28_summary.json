      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance is supposed to be in a specific form, and then I have to find the sum m + n + p. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note the given edge lengths. The tetrahedron has opposite edges equal:\n- AB = CD = sqrt(41)\n- AC = BD = sqrt(80)\n- BC = AD = sqrt(89)\n\nSo, each pair of opposite edges is equal. That probably means the tetrahedron is \"isohedral\" or something? Wait, no, isohedral means all faces are congruent, which might not be the case here. Maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron, but I'm not sure. Anyway, the key is that opposite edges are equal, which might help in calculating volume or other properties.\n\nThe point I is the incenter, which is the center of the inscribed sphere tangent to all faces. The distance from I to each face is the inradius, r. To find r, I remember that for a tetrahedron, the formula is r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find V and S.\n\nBut wait, how do I calculate the volume of a tetrahedron when I know all the edges? I think I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant. Yeah, that's a formula for the volume given all the pairwise distances. Let me recall the formula.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is:\n\nV = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the matrix:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   a\u00b2   b\u00b2   c\u00b2 |\n| 1  a\u00b2   0    d\u00b2   e\u00b2 |\n| 1  b\u00b2  d\u00b2   0    f\u00b2 |\n| 1  c\u00b2  e\u00b2  f\u00b2   0  |\n\nSo, I need to plug in the given edge lengths into this matrix and compute the determinant. Let's assign the edges:\n\nAB = sqrt(41) \u21d2 a = sqrt(41), so a\u00b2 = 41\nAC = sqrt(80) \u21d2 b = sqrt(80), b\u00b2 = 80\nAD = sqrt(89) \u21d2 c = sqrt(89), c\u00b2 = 89\nBC = sqrt(89) \u21d2 d = sqrt(89), d\u00b2 = 89\nBD = sqrt(80) \u21d2 e = sqrt(80), e\u00b2 = 80\nCD = sqrt(41) \u21d2 f = sqrt(41), f\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo, let's set up the Cayley-Menger matrix:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me make sure. The matrix is symmetric, so the positions (i,j) and (j,i) are the same. Let me check:\n\n- (1,2) is a\u00b2 =41, (2,1)=41. Correct.\n- (1,3)=b\u00b2=80, (3,1)=80. Correct.\n- (1,4)=c\u00b2=89, (4,1)=89. Correct.\n- (2,3)=d\u00b2=89, (3,2)=89. Correct.\n- (2,4)=e\u00b2=80, (4,2)=80. Correct.\n- (3,4)=f\u00b2=41, (4,3)=41. Correct.\n\nSo, the matrix is correctly set up. Now, I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. Hmm, that's going to be a bit of work. Maybe I can use some properties or symmetries to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can subtract rows or columns to create zeros, making the determinant easier to compute. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this tetrahedron is a kind of \"equifacial\" tetrahedron, but I'm not sure. Wait, all opposite edges are equal, which sometimes is called a \"disphenoid\". Yes, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. And in a disphenoid, all faces are congruent triangles, so that might help.\n\nIf all faces are congruent, then the surface area would just be 4 times the area of one face. Also, the volume might be easier to compute because of the symmetry.\n\nWait, let me confirm if all faces are congruent. Let's compute the lengths of the edges of each face.\n\nTake face ABC: edges AB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), BC = sqrt(89).\n\nFace ABD: edges AB = sqrt(41), AD = sqrt(89), BD = sqrt(80).\n\nFace ACD: edges AC = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89), CD = sqrt(41).\n\nFace BCD: edges BC = sqrt(89), BD = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41).\n\nSo, each face has edges of lengths sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Therefore, all four faces are congruent triangles. So, yes, this is a disphenoid with congruent faces. That's good, because then I can compute the surface area as 4 times the area of one face.\n\nSo, maybe I can compute the area of one face and multiply by 4 for the surface area. And for the volume, perhaps I can use another approach because of the symmetry.\n\nWait, but the volume can also be calculated using the Cayley-Menger determinant, which I was starting earlier. Maybe I should proceed with that.\n\nAlternatively, since all faces are congruent, perhaps the inradius can be found via some other formula. But I think I'll stick with the Cayley-Menger determinant to compute the volume.\n\nSo, let's compute the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix.\n\nThe matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nComputing the determinant of a 5x5 matrix is tedious. Maybe I can use expansion by minors, but that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can perform row or column operations to simplify the matrix.\n\nLet me try subtracting Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4 to create zeros in the first column (except Row 0). Wait, actually, the first column (index 0) is [0,1,1,1,1], so maybe subtracting Row 0 from other rows? Wait, no, because Row 0 has 0 in the first position, but others have 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps subtracting Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4. Let's see:\n\nRow 2 = Row2 - Row1:\n\nRow2: 1-1=0, 41-0=41, 0-41=-41, 89-80=9, 80-89=-9\n\nWait, no, actually, the Cayley-Menger determinant is a 5x5 matrix, so the rows are as follows:\n\nWait, actually, I think the Cayley-Menger matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, AB\u00b2, AC\u00b2, AD\u00b2\n\nRow 2: 1, AB\u00b2, 0, BC\u00b2, BD\u00b2\n\nRow 3: 1, AC\u00b2, BC\u00b2, 0, CD\u00b2\n\nRow 4: 1, AD\u00b2, BD\u00b2, CD\u00b2, 0\n\nSo, in our case:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nSo, perhaps I can perform row operations to create zeros in the first column (except for Row 0). Let me try subtracting Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4.\n\nSo, Row2_new = Row2 - Row1:\n\nRow2: 1-1=0, 41-0=41, 0-41=-41, 89-80=9, 80-89=-9\n\nSimilarly, Row3_new = Row3 - Row1:\n\nRow3: 1-1=0, 80-0=80, 89-41=48, 0-80=-80, 41-89=-48\n\nRow4_new = Row4 - Row1:\n\nRow4: 1-1=0, 89-0=89, 80-41=39, 41-80=-39, 0-89=-89\n\nSo, after these operations, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 0, 41, -41, 9, -9\n\nRow 3: 0, 80, 48, -80, -48\n\nRow 4: 0, 89, 39, -39, -89\n\nNow, the determinant remains the same (since we subtracted rows). Now, let's expand the determinant along the first column, which has 0s except for Row 0 and Row1.\n\nBut wait, in the first column, Row0 has 0, and Rows 1-4 have 1, 0, 0, 0 after the operations. Wait no, after the operations, Rows 2-4 have 0 in the first column. So, the first column is [0,1,0,0,0]. So, the only non-zero entry is in Row1, Column0, which is 1.\n\nSo, when expanding the determinant along the first column, the minor for Row1, Column0 is the determinant of the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing Row1 and Column0.\n\nSo, the determinant is (-1)^(1+0) * 1 * det(minor_matrix), where minor_matrix is:\n\nRow0: [1, 1, 1, 1] (but without the first column, so it's [1,1,1,1] as the first row? Wait, no, wait, the minor is the matrix without Row1 and Column0.\n\nWait, the original matrix after operations is:\n\nRow0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow2: 0, 41, -41, 9, -9\n\nRow3: 0, 80, 48, -80, -48\n\nRow4: 0, 89, 39, -39, -89\n\nSo, if we remove Row1 and Column0, the minor_matrix is:\n\nRow0: 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow1: 41, -41, 9, -9\n\nRow2: 80, 48, -80, -48\n\nRow3: 89, 39, -39, -89\n\nWait, no. When we remove Row1 and Column0, the minor_matrix is:\n\nThe rows are Rows0,2,3,4, and the columns are Columns1,2,3,4.\n\nSo:\n\nRow0: [1, 1, 1, 1] (columns 1,2,3,4 of Row0)\n\nRow1: [41, -41, 9, -9] (columns 1,2,3,4 of Row2)\n\nRow2: [80, 48, -80, -48] (columns 1,2,3,4 of Row3)\n\nRow3: [89, 39, -39, -89] (columns 1,2,3,4 of Row4)\n\nSo, the minor_matrix is:\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n[41, -41, 9, -9]\n\n[80, 48, -80, -48]\n\n[89, 39, -39, -89]\n\nNow, the determinant of the Cayley-Menger determinant is (-1)^(1+0) * 1 * det(minor_matrix) = (-1)^1 * det(minor_matrix) = -det(minor_matrix).\n\nSo, I need to compute the determinant of this 4x4 matrix. Hmm, that's still a bit involved, but maybe I can perform some row operations to simplify it.\n\nLooking at the minor_matrix:\n\nRow0: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow1: [41, -41, 9, -9]\n\nRow2: [80, 48, -80, -48]\n\nRow3: [89, 39, -39, -89]\n\nI notice that Row1 and Row2 have some common factors. Let me factor out common terms:\n\nRow1: 41, -41, 9, -9. I can factor out 41 from the first two elements and 9 from the last two? Hmm, but that might not help much. Alternatively, notice that Row1 can be written as 41*(1, -1) + 9*(1, -1). Wait, that's 41*(1, -1) + 9*(1, -1) = (41+9)(1, -1) = 50*(1, -1). Wait, no, that's not correct because the last two elements are 9 and -9, which is 9*(1, -1), but the first two are 41*(1, -1). So, Row1 is 41*(1, -1, 0, 0) + 9*(0,0,1,-1). Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can subtract Row1 from Row2 and Row3 to create zeros.\n\nLet's try subtracting Row1 from Row2 and Row3.\n\nRow2_new = Row2 - Row1:\n\n80 - 41 = 39\n\n48 - (-41) = 89\n\n-80 - 9 = -89\n\n-48 - (-9) = -39\n\nSo, Row2_new: [39, 89, -89, -39]\n\nSimilarly, Row3_new = Row3 - Row1:\n\n89 -41=48\n\n39 - (-41)=80\n\n-39 -9= -48\n\n-89 - (-9)= -80\n\nSo, Row3_new: [48, 80, -48, -80]\n\nNow, the minor_matrix becomes:\n\nRow0: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow1: [41, -41, 9, -9]\n\nRow2: [39, 89, -89, -39]\n\nRow3: [48, 80, -48, -80]\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor out some terms from Row2 and Row3.\n\nLooking at Row2: [39, 89, -89, -39]. I notice that the first and last elements are 39 and -39, which are negatives. Similarly, the second and third are 89 and -89. So, Row2 can be written as [39, 89, -89, -39] = 39*(1, 0, 0, -1) + 89*(0,1,-1,0). Hmm, not sure if helpful.\n\nLooking at Row3: [48, 80, -48, -80]. Similarly, the first and third are 48 and -48, and second and fourth are 80 and -80. So, Row3 can be written as 48*(1,0,-1,0) + 80*(0,1,0,-1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor out 13 from Row2: 39=13*3, 89 is prime, 48=16*3, 80=16*5, etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can perform more row operations. Let me try to create zeros in the first column of Rows2 and 3.\n\nSince Row0 has [1,1,1,1], perhaps subtract Row0 multiplied by some factor from Rows2 and 3.\n\nBut maybe it's better to proceed with expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps expand along Row0, which has all 1s. Let's try that.\n\nThe determinant of the minor_matrix can be expanded along Row0:\n\ndet = 1 * det(minor11) - 1 * det(minor12) + 1 * det(minor13) - 1 * det(minor14)\n\nWhere minor11 is the 3x3 matrix obtained by removing Row0 and Column1:\n\nminor11:\n\nRow1: [-41, 9, -9]\n\nRow2: [89, -89, -39]\n\nRow3: [80, -48, -80]\n\nSimilarly, minor12 is removing Row0 and Column2:\n\nminor12:\n\nRow1: [41, 9, -9]\n\nRow2: [39, -89, -39]\n\nRow3: [48, -48, -80]\n\nWait, this is getting complicated, but let's proceed.\n\nCompute each minor:\n\nFirst, minor11:\n\n| -41   9    -9  |\n| 89  -89   -39 |\n| 80  -48   -80 |\n\nCompute determinant:\n\n= -41 * [(-89)(-80) - (-39)(-48)] - 9 * [89*(-80) - (-39)*80] + (-9) * [89*(-48) - (-89)*80]\n\nWait, that's a bit messy. Let's compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: -41 * [ ( (-89)*(-80) ) - ( (-39)*(-48) ) ]\n\n= -41 * [ 7120 - 1872 ]\n\n= -41 * (5248)\n\n= -41 * 5248. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute 41 * 5248:\n\n41 * 5000 = 205,000\n\n41 * 248 = 41*(200 + 48) = 8,200 + 1,968 = 10,168\n\nSo, total 205,000 + 10,168 = 215,168. So, -41 * 5248 = -215,168.\n\nSecond term: -9 * [89*(-80) - (-39)*80 ]\n\n= -9 * [ -7120 + 3120 ]\n\n= -9 * (-4000) = 36,000\n\nThird term: (-9) * [89*(-48) - (-89)*80 ]\n\n= (-9) * [ -4272 + 7120 ]\n\n= (-9) * (2848) = -25,632\n\nSo, minor11 determinant = (-215,168) + 36,000 + (-25,632) = (-215,168 + 36,000) = -179,168; then -179,168 -25,632 = -204,800.\n\nSo, minor11 determinant is -204,800.\n\nNow, minor12:\n\n| 41   9    -9  |\n| 39  -89   -39 |\n| 48  -48   -80 |\n\nCompute determinant:\n\n= 41 * [ (-89)(-80) - (-39)(-48) ] - 9 * [39*(-80) - (-39)*48] + (-9) * [39*(-48) - (-89)*48]\n\nCompute each part:\n\nFirst term: 41 * [7120 - 1872] = 41 * 5248 = 215,168 (as before)\n\nSecond term: -9 * [ -3120 - (-1872) ] = -9 * [ -3120 + 1872 ] = -9 * (-1248) = 11,232\n\nThird term: (-9) * [ -1872 - (-4272) ] = (-9) * (2400) = -21,600\n\nSo, minor12 determinant = 215,168 + 11,232 - 21,600 = (215,168 + 11,232) = 226,400; 226,400 -21,600 = 204,800.\n\nSo, minor12 determinant is 204,800.\n\nNow, minor13:\n\nThis is the determinant of the matrix obtained by removing Row0 and Column3:\n\nRows1,2,3 and columns1,2,4.\n\nSo, minor13 is:\n\nRow1: [41, -41, -9]\n\nRow2: [39, 89, -39]\n\nRow3: [48, 80, -80]\n\nCompute determinant:\n\n= 41 * [89*(-80) - (-39)*80] - (-41) * [39*(-80) - (-39)*48] + (-9) * [39*80 - 89*48]\n\nLet's compute each term.\n\nFirst term: 41 * [ -7120 + 3120 ] = 41 * (-4000) = -164,000\n\nSecond term: -(-41) * [ -3120 + 1872 ] = 41 * (-1248) = -51, 168? Wait, 41 * 1248.\n\nWait, 41 * 1000 = 41,000; 41*248=10,168. So, 41*1248=41*(1000+248)=41,000+10,168=51,168. So, it's -51,168.\n\nThird term: (-9) * [ 3120 - 4272 ] = (-9) * (-1152) = 10,368\n\nSo, minor13 determinant = -164,000 -51,168 + 10,368.\n\nCompute: -164,000 -51,168 = -215,168; then -215,168 +10,368 = -204,800.\n\nSo, minor13 determinant is -204,800.\n\nNow, minor14:\n\nThis is the determinant of the matrix obtained by removing Row0 and Column4:\n\nRows1,2,3 and columns1,2,3.\n\nSo, minor14 is:\n\nRow1: [41, -41, 9]\n\nRow2: [39, 89, -89]\n\nRow3: [48, 80, -48]\n\nCompute determinant:\n\n= 41 * [89*(-48) - (-89)*80 ] - (-41) * [39*(-48) - (-89)*48 ] + 9 * [39*80 - 89*48 ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 41 * [ -4272 + 7120 ] = 41 * 2848 = 41 * (2800 + 48) = 41*2800=114,800; 41*48=1,968. So, 114,800 +1,968=116,768.\n\nSecond term: -(-41) * [ -1872 + 4272 ] = 41 * (2400) = 98,400.\n\nThird term: 9 * [3120 - 4272 ] = 9*(-1152)= -10,368.\n\nSo, minor14 determinant = 116,768 +98,400 -10,368.\n\nCompute: 116,768 +98,400 = 215,168; 215,168 -10,368 = 204,800.\n\nSo, minor14 determinant is 204,800.\n\nPutting it all together, the determinant of the minor_matrix is:\n\n1*(-204,800) -1*(204,800) +1*(-204,800) -1*(204,800)\n\n= (-204,800) -204,800 + (-204,800) -204,800\n\n= (-204,800)*4 = -819,200.\n\nSo, the determinant of the minor_matrix is -819,200.\n\nBut remember, the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix is -det(minor_matrix) = -(-819,200) = 819,200.\n\nWait, no, wait. The determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix is (-1)^1 * det(minor_matrix) = -det(minor_matrix). Since det(minor_matrix) is -819,200, then the determinant is -(-819,200) = 819,200.\n\nSo, the determinant is 819,200.\n\nNow, the volume is sqrt( |CM| / 288 ). So, |CM| is 819,200.\n\nSo, V = sqrt(819200 / 288).\n\nSimplify 819200 / 288:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16: 819200 \u00f716=51200; 288 \u00f716=18.\n\nSo, 51200 / 18.\n\nSimplify further: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 25600 /9.\n\nSo, 25600 /9.\n\nSo, V = sqrt(25600 /9) = sqrt(25600)/sqrt(9) = 160 /3.\n\nSo, volume V is 160/3.\n\nAlright, got the volume. Now, the next step is to compute the total surface area S.\n\nSince all four faces are congruent triangles, each with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), I can compute the area of one face and multiply by 4.\n\nLet me compute the area of triangle with sides a= sqrt(41), b= sqrt(80), c= sqrt(89).\n\nI can use Heron's formula.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, s = [sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)] / 2.\n\nBut that's going to be messy. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area using another formula, like 1/2 * base * height, but I don't know the height.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the area using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nBut that's Heron's formula squared.\n\nWait, let's compute Heron's formula step by step.\n\nCompute s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.\n\nBut this will be messy, but let's compute the terms:\n\nCompute (a + b + c) = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)\n\nCompute (-a + b + c) = -sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)\n\nCompute (a - b + c) = sqrt(41) - sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)\n\nCompute (a + b - c) = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) - sqrt(89)\n\nMultiplying these four terms together would be complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, since the triangle is part of the tetrahedron, perhaps we can compute the area via vectors or coordinates.\n\nWait, another approach: since all edges are known, maybe we can find the area using the cross product if we assign coordinates to the points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the area by noting that the triangle is a right triangle. Let me check if that's the case.\n\nCompute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 and see if it equals c\u00b2.\n\na\u00b2 =41, b\u00b2=80, c\u00b2=89.\n\n41 +80=121, which is not equal to 89. So, not a right triangle.\n\nHmm, another thought: maybe compute the area using the formula involving the sides and the volume? Wait, no, that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the area via the formula:\n\nArea = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)^2 - 4(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)^2 )) / 4\n\nWait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe use the cosine law to find one angle and then compute the area as (1/2)ab sin(theta).\n\nLet me try that.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines to find angle opposite to c (sqrt(89)):\n\ncos(theta) = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)/(2ab)\n\n= (41 + 80 -89)/(2*sqrt(41)*sqrt(80))\n\n= (32)/(2*sqrt(41*80)) = 16 / sqrt(3280)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3280):\n\n3280 = 16*205 =16*5*41. So sqrt(3280)=4*sqrt(205).\n\nSo, cos(theta)=16/(4*sqrt(205))=4/sqrt(205)\n\nThen, sin(theta)=sqrt(1 - (16/205))=sqrt(189/205)=sqrt(189)/sqrt(205)= (3*sqrt(21))/sqrt(205)\n\nSo, area = (1/2)*a*b*sin(theta) = (1/2)*sqrt(41)*sqrt(80)*(3*sqrt(21)/sqrt(205))\n\nSimplify:\n\nsqrt(41)*sqrt(80) = sqrt(41*80)=sqrt(3280)=4*sqrt(205) as before.\n\nSo, area = (1/2)*4*sqrt(205) * (3*sqrt(21)/sqrt(205)) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1/2)*4=2, sqrt(205) cancels with 1/sqrt(205), leaving 2*3*sqrt(21)=6*sqrt(21)\n\nSo, area of one face is 6*sqrt(21).\n\nTherefore, total surface area S =4*6*sqrt(21)=24*sqrt(21).\n\nSo, S=24\u221a21.\n\nAlright, so now I have V=160/3 and S=24\u221a21.\n\nThe inradius r=3V/S.\n\nSo, compute r= 3*(160/3)/(24\u221a21)= (160)/(24\u221a21)= (20)/(3\u221a21)\n\nRationalizing the denominator: (20\u221a21)/(3*21)= (20\u221a21)/(63)\n\nSo, r=20\u221a21/63.\n\nSimplify: check if 20 and 63 have common factors. 20=2\u00b2*5, 63=7*3\u00b2. No common factors, so m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nBut wait, let me check if the fraction can be reduced. 20 and 63 are coprime? Yes, because 20's prime factors are 2 and 5, and 63's are 3 and 7. So, yes, 20 and 63 are coprime. Also, n=21 is square-free because 21=3*7, no square factors. So, the expression is in the simplest form.\n\nTherefore, m=20, n=21, p=63. So, m +n +p=20+21+63=104.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations, especially the area of the face. Because if that's wrong, everything else is off.\n\nEarlier, when computing the area using the Law of Cosines, I had:\n\nArea = (1/2)*a*b*sin(theta) = (1/2)*sqrt(41)*sqrt(80)*(3*sqrt(21)/sqrt(205)).\n\nWhich simplified to 6*sqrt(21). Let me recheck that.\n\nsqrt(41)*sqrt(80)=sqrt(41*80)=sqrt(3280)=sqrt(16*205)=4*sqrt(205). Correct.\n\nSo, (1/2)*4*sqrt(205)=2*sqrt(205). Then, multiplied by (3*sqrt(21)/sqrt(205)).\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(205) * 3*sqrt(21)/sqrt(205)=2*3*sqrt(21)=6*sqrt(21). Correct.\n\nSo, the area is indeed 6\u221a21, so total surface area 24\u221a21. Correct.\n\nThen, volume was 160/3. So, 3V/S= (3*(160/3))/(24\u221a21)=160/(24\u221a21)=20/(3\u221a21)=20\u221a21/(63). Correct.\n\nSo, yes, r=20\u221a21/63, so m=20, n=21, p=63. Sum is 20+21+63=104.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance is supposed to be in a specific form, and then I have to find the sum m + n + p. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note the given edge lengths. The tetrahedron has opposite edges equal:\n- AB = CD = sqrt(41)\n- AC = BD = sqrt(80)\n- BC = AD = sqrt(89)\n\nSo, each pair of opposite edges is equal. That probably means the tetrahedron is \"isohedral\" or something? Wait, no, isohedral means all faces are congruent, which might not be the case here. Maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron, but I'm not sure. Anyway, the key is that opposite edges are equal, which might help in calculating volume or other properties.\n\nThe point I is the incenter, which is the center of the inscribed sphere tangent to all faces. The distance from I to each face is the inradius, r. To find r, I remember that for a tetrahedron, the formula is r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find V and S.\n\nBut wait, how do I calculate the volume of a tetrahedron when I know all the edges? I think I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant. Yeah, that's a formula for the volume given all the pairwise distances. Let me recall the formula.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is:\n\nV = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the matrix:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   a\u00b2   b\u00b2   c\u00b2 |\n| 1  a\u00b2   0    d\u00b2   e\u00b2 |\n| 1  b\u00b2  d\u00b2   0    f\u00b2 |\n| 1  c\u00b2  e\u00b2  f\u00b2   0  |\n\nSo, I need to plug in the given edge lengths into this matrix and compute the determinant. Let's assign the edges:\n\nAB = sqrt(41) \u21d2 a = sqrt(41), so a\u00b2 = 41\nAC = sqrt(80) \u21d2 b = sqrt(80), b\u00b2 = 80\nAD = sqrt(89) \u21d2 c = sqrt(89), c\u00b2 = 89\nBC = sqrt(89) \u21d2 d = sqrt(89), d\u00b2 = 89\nBD = sqrt(80) \u21d2 e = sqrt(80), e\u00b2 = 80\nCD = sqrt(41) \u21d2 f = sqrt(41), f\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo, let's set up the Cayley-Menger matrix:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me make sure. The matrix is symmetric, so the positions (i,j) and (j,i) are the same. Let me check:\n\n- (1,2) is a\u00b2 =41, (2,1)=41. Correct.\n- (1,3)=b\u00b2=80, (3,1)=80. Correct.\n- (1,4)=c\u00b2=89, (4,1)=89. Correct.\n- (2,3)=d\u00b2=89, (3,2)=89. Correct.\n- (2,4)=e\u00b2=80, (4,2)=80. Correct.\n- (3,4)=f\u00b2=41, (4,3)=41. Correct.\n\nSo, the matrix is correctly set up. Now, I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. Hmm, that's going to be a bit of work. Maybe I can use some properties or symmetries to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can subtract rows or columns to create zeros, making the determinant easier to compute. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this tetrahedron is a kind of \"equifacial\" tetrahedron, but I'm not sure. Wait, all opposite edges are equal, which sometimes is called a \"disphenoid\". Yes, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. And in a disphenoid, all faces are congruent triangles, so that might help.\n\nIf all faces are congruent, then the surface area would just be 4 times the area of one face. Also, the volume might be easier to compute because of the symmetry.\n\nWait, let me confirm if all faces are congruent. Let's compute the lengths of the edges of each face.\n\nTake face ABC: edges AB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), BC = sqrt(89).\n\nFace ABD: edges AB = sqrt(41), AD = sqrt(89), BD = sqrt(80).\n\nFace ACD: edges AC = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89), CD = sqrt(41).\n\nFace BCD: edges BC = sqrt(89), BD = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41).\n\nSo, each face has edges of lengths sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Therefore, all four faces are congruent triangles. So, yes, this is a disphenoid with congruent faces. That's good, because then I can compute the surface area as 4 times the area of one face.\n\nSo, maybe I can compute the area of one face and multiply by 4 for the surface area. And for the volume, perhaps I can use another approach because of the symmetry.\n\nWait, but the volume can also be calculated using the Cayley-Menger determinant, which I was starting earlier. Maybe I should proceed with that.\n\nAlternatively, since all faces are congruent, perhaps the inradius can be found via some other formula. But I think I'll stick with the Cayley-Menger determinant to compute the volume.\n\nSo, let's compute the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix.\n\nThe matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nComputing the determinant of a 5x5 matrix is tedious. Maybe I can use expansion by minors, but that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can perform row or column operations to simplify the matrix.\n\nLet me try subtracting Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4 to create zeros in the first column (except Row 0). Wait, actually, the first column (index 0) is [0,1,1,1,1], so maybe subtracting Row 0 from other rows? Wait, no, because Row 0 has 0 in the first position, but others have 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps subtracting Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4. Let's see:\n\nRow 2 = Row2 - Row1:\n\nRow2: 1-1=0, 41-0=41, 0-41=-41, 89-80=9, 80-89=-9\n\nWait, no, actually, the Cayley-Menger determinant is a 5x5 matrix, so the rows are as follows:\n\nWait, actually, I think the Cayley-Menger matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, AB\u00b2, AC\u00b2, AD\u00b2\n\nRow 2: 1, AB\u00b2, 0, BC\u00b2, BD\u00b2\n\nRow 3: 1, AC\u00b2, BC\u00b2, 0, CD\u00b2\n\nRow 4: 1, AD\u00b2, BD\u00b2, CD\u00b2, 0\n\nSo, in our case:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nSo, perhaps I can perform row operations to create zeros in the first column (except for Row 0). Let me try subtracting Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4.\n\nSo, Row2_new = Row2 - Row1:\n\nRow2: 1-1=0, 41-0=41, 0-41=-41, 89-80=9, 80-89=-9\n\nSimilarly, Row3_new = Row3 - Row1:\n\nRow3: 1-1=0, 80-0=80, 89-41=48, 0-80=-80, 41-89=-48\n\nRow4_new = Row4 - Row1:\n\nRow4: 1-1=0, 89-0=89, 80-41=39, 41-80=-39, 0-89=-89\n\nSo, after these operations, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 0, 41, -41, 9, -9\n\nRow 3: 0, 80, 48, -80, -48\n\nRow 4: 0, 89, 39, -39, -89\n\nNow, the determinant remains the same (since we subtracted rows). Now, let's expand the determinant along the first column, which has 0s except for Row 0 and Row1.\n\nBut wait, in the first column, Row0 has 0, and Rows 1-4 have 1, 0, 0, 0 after the operations. Wait no, after the operations, Rows 2-4 have 0 in the first column. So, the first column is [0,1,0,0,0]. So, the only non-zero entry is in Row1, Column0, which is 1.\n\nSo, when expanding the determinant along the first column, the minor for Row1, Column0 is the determinant of the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing Row1 and Column0.\n\nSo, the determinant is (-1)^(1+0) * 1 * det(minor_matrix), where minor_matrix is:\n\nRow0: [1, 1, 1, 1] (but without the first column, so it's [1,1,1,1] as the first row? Wait, no, wait, the minor is the matrix without Row1 and Column0.\n\nWait, the original matrix after operations is:\n\nRow0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow2: 0, 41, -41, 9, -9\n\nRow3: 0, 80, 48, -80, -48\n\nRow4: 0, 89, 39, -39, -89\n\nSo, if we remove Row1 and Column0, the minor_matrix is:\n\nRow0: 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow1: 41, -41, 9, -9\n\nRow2: 80, 48, -80, -48\n\nRow3: 89, 39, -39, -89\n\nWait, no. When we remove Row1 and Column0, the minor_matrix is:\n\nThe rows are Rows0,2,3,4, and the columns are Columns1,2,3,4.\n\nSo:\n\nRow0: [1, 1, 1, 1] (columns 1,2,3,4 of Row0)\n\nRow1: [41, -41, 9, -9] (columns 1,2,3,4 of Row2)\n\nRow2: [80, 48, -80, -48] (columns 1,2,3,4 of Row3)\n\nRow3: [89, 39, -39, -89] (columns 1,2,3,4 of Row4)\n\nSo, the minor_matrix is:\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n[41, -41, 9, -9]\n\n[80, 48, -80, -48]\n\n[89, 39, -39, -89]\n\nNow, the determinant of the Cayley-Menger determinant is (-1)^(1+0) * 1 * det(minor_matrix) = (-1)^1 * det(minor_matrix) = -det(minor_matrix).\n\nSo, I need to compute the determinant of this 4x4 matrix. Hmm, that's still a bit involved, but maybe I can perform some row operations to simplify it.\n\nLooking at the minor_matrix:\n\nRow0: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow1: [41, -41, 9, -9]\n\nRow2: [80, 48, -80, -48]\n\nRow3: [89, 39, -39, -89]\n\nI notice that Row1 and Row2 have some common factors. Let me factor out common terms:\n\nRow1: 41, -41, 9, -9. I can factor out 41 from the first two elements and 9 from the last two? Hmm, but that might not help much. Alternatively, notice that Row1 can be written as 41*(1, -1) + 9*(1, -1). Wait, that's 41*(1, -1) + 9*(1, -1) = (41+9)(1, -1) = 50*(1, -1). Wait, no, that's not correct because the last two elements are 9 and -9, which is 9*(1, -1), but the first two are 41*(1, -1). So, Row1 is 41*(1, -1, 0, 0) + 9*(0,0,1,-1). Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can subtract Row1 from Row2 and Row3 to create zeros.\n\nLet's try subtracting Row1 from Row2 and Row3.\n\nRow2_new = Row2 - Row1:\n\n80 - 41 = 39\n\n48 - (-41) = 89\n\n-80 - 9 = -89\n\n-48 - (-9) = -39\n\nSo, Row2_new: [39, 89, -89, -39]\n\nSimilarly, Row3_new = Row3 - Row1:\n\n89 -41=48\n\n39 - (-41)=80\n\n-39 -9= -48\n\n-89 - (-9)= -80\n\nSo, Row3_new: [48, 80, -48, -80]\n\nNow, the minor_matrix becomes:\n\nRow0: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow1: [41, -41, 9, -9]\n\nRow2: [39, 89, -89, -39]\n\nRow3: [48, 80, -48, -80]\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor out some terms from Row2 and Row3.\n\nLooking at Row2: [39, 89, -89, -39]. I notice that the first and last elements are 39 and -39, which are negatives. Similarly, the second and third are 89 and -89. So, Row2 can be written as [39, 89, -89, -39] = 39*(1, 0, 0, -1) + 89*(0,1,-1,0). Hmm, not sure if helpful.\n\nLooking at Row3: [48, 80, -48, -80]. Similarly, the first and third are 48 and -48, and second and fourth are 80 and -80. So, Row3 can be written as 48*(1,0,-1,0) + 80*(0,1,0,-1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor out 13 from Row2: 39=13*3, 89 is prime, 48=16*3, 80=16*5, etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can perform more row operations. Let me try to create zeros in the first column of Rows2 and 3.\n\nSince Row0 has [1,1,1,1], perhaps subtract Row0 multiplied by some factor from Rows2 and 3.\n\nBut maybe it's better to proceed with expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps expand along Row0, which has all 1s. Let's try that.\n\nThe determinant of the minor_matrix can be expanded along Row0:\n\ndet = 1 * det(minor11) - 1 * det(minor12) + 1 * det(minor13) - 1 * det(minor14)\n\nWhere minor11 is the 3x3 matrix obtained by removing Row0 and Column1:\n\nminor11:\n\nRow1: [-41, 9, -9]\n\nRow2: [89, -89, -39]\n\nRow3: [80, -48, -80]\n\nSimilarly, minor12 is removing Row0 and Column2:\n\nminor12:\n\nRow1: [41, 9, -9]\n\nRow2: [39, -89, -39]\n\nRow3: [48, -48, -80]\n\nWait, this is getting complicated, but let's proceed.\n\nCompute each minor:\n\nFirst, minor11:\n\n| -41   9    -9  |\n| 89  -89   -39 |\n| 80  -48   -80 |\n\nCompute determinant:\n\n= -41 * [(-89)(-80) - (-39)(-48)] - 9 * [89*(-80) - (-39)*80] + (-9) * [89*(-48) - (-89)*80]\n\nWait, that's a bit messy. Let's compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: -41 * [ ( (-89)*(-80) ) - ( (-39)*(-48) ) ]\n\n= -41 * [ 7120 - 1872 ]\n\n= -41 * (5248)\n\n= -41 * 5248. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute 41 * 5248:\n\n41 * 5000 = 205,000\n\n41 * 248 = 41*(200 + 48) = 8,200 + 1,968 = 10,168\n\nSo, total 205,000 + 10,168 = 215,168. So, -41 * 5248 = -215,168.\n\nSecond term: -9 * [89*(-80) - (-39)*80 ]\n\n= -9 * [ -7120 + 3120 ]\n\n= -9 * (-4000) = 36,000\n\nThird term: (-9) * [89*(-48) - (-89)*80 ]\n\n= (-9) * [ -4272 + 7120 ]\n\n= (-9) * (2848) = -25,632\n\nSo, minor11 determinant = (-215,168) + 36,000 + (-25,632) = (-215,168 + 36,000) = -179,168; then -179,168 -25,632 = -204,800.\n\nSo, minor11 determinant is -204,800.\n\nNow, minor12:\n\n| 41   9    -9  |\n| 39  -89   -39 |\n| 48  -48   -80 |\n\nCompute determinant:\n\n= 41 * [ (-89)(-80) - (-39)(-48) ] - 9 * [39*(-80) - (-39)*48] + (-9) * [39*(-48) - (-89)*48]\n\nCompute each part:\n\nFirst term: 41 * [7120 - 1872] = 41 * 5248 = 215,168 (as before)\n\nSecond term: -9 * [ -3120 - (-1872) ] = -9 * [ -3120 + 1872 ] = -9 * (-1248) = 11,232\n\nThird term: (-9) * [ -1872 - (-4272) ] = (-9) * (2400) = -21,600\n\nSo, minor12 determinant = 215,168 + 11,232 - 21,600 = (215,168 + 11,232) = 226,400; 226,400 -21,600 = 204,800.\n\nSo, minor12 determinant is 204,800.\n\nNow, minor13:\n\nThis is the determinant of the matrix obtained by removing Row0 and Column3:\n\nRows1,2,3 and columns1,2,4.\n\nSo, minor13 is:\n\nRow1: [41, -41, -9]\n\nRow2: [39, 89, -39]\n\nRow3: [48, 80, -80]\n\nCompute determinant:\n\n= 41 * [89*(-80) - (-39)*80] - (-41) * [39*(-80) - (-39)*48] + (-9) * [39*80 - 89*48]\n\nLet's compute each term.\n\nFirst term: 41 * [ -7120 + 3120 ] = 41 * (-4000) = -164,000\n\nSecond term: -(-41) * [ -3120 + 1872 ] = 41 * (-1248) = -51, 168? Wait, 41 * 1248.\n\nWait, 41 * 1000 = 41,000; 41*248=10,168. So, 41*1248=41*(1000+248)=41,000+10,168=51,168. So, it's -51,168.\n\nThird term: (-9) * [ 3120 - 4272 ] = (-9) * (-1152) = 10,368\n\nSo, minor13 determinant = -164,000 -51,168 + 10,368.\n\nCompute: -164,000 -51,168 = -215,168; then -215,168 +10,368 = -204,800.\n\nSo, minor13 determinant is -204,800.\n\nNow, minor14:\n\nThis is the determinant of the matrix obtained by removing Row0 and Column4:\n\nRows1,2,3 and columns1,2,3.\n\nSo, minor14 is:\n\nRow1: [41, -41, 9]\n\nRow2: [39, 89, -89]\n\nRow3: [48, 80, -48]\n\nCompute determinant:\n\n= 41 * [89*(-48) - (-89)*80 ] - (-41) * [39*(-48) - (-89)*48 ] + 9 * [39*80 - 89*48 ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 41 * [ -4272 + 7120 ] = 41 * 2848 = 41 * (2800 + 48) = 41*2800=114,800; 41*48=1,968. So, 114,800 +1,968=116,768.\n\nSecond term: -(-41) * [ -1872 + 4272 ] = 41 * (2400) = 98,400.\n\nThird term: 9 * [3120 - 4272 ] = 9*(-1152)= -10,368.\n\nSo, minor14 determinant = 116,768 +98,400 -10,368.\n\nCompute: 116,768 +98,400 = 215,168; 215,168 -10,368 = 204,800.\n\nSo, minor14 determinant is 204,800.\n\nPutting it all together, the determinant of the minor_matrix is:\n\n1*(-204,800) -1*(204,800) +1*(-204,800) -1*(204,800)\n\n= (-204,800) -204,800 + (-204,800) -204,800\n\n= (-204,800)*4 = -819,200.\n\nSo, the determinant of the minor_matrix is -819,200.\n\nBut remember, the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix is -det(minor_matrix) = -(-819,200) = 819,200.\n\nWait, no, wait. The determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix is (-1)^1 * det(minor_matrix) = -det(minor_matrix). Since det(minor_matrix) is -819,200, then the determinant is -(-819,200) = 819,200.\n\nSo, the determinant is 819,200.\n\nNow, the volume is sqrt( |CM| / 288 ). So, |CM| is 819,200.\n\nSo, V = sqrt(819200 / 288).\n\nSimplify 819200 / 288:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16: 819200 \u00f716=51200; 288 \u00f716=18.\n\nSo, 51200 / 18.\n\nSimplify further: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 25600 /9.\n\nSo, 25600 /9.\n\nSo, V = sqrt(25600 /9) = sqrt(25600)/sqrt(9) = 160 /3.\n\nSo, volume V is 160/3.\n\nAlright, got the volume. Now, the next step is to compute the total surface area S.\n\nSince all four faces are congruent triangles, each with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), I can compute the area of one face and multiply by 4.\n\nLet me compute the area of triangle with sides a= sqrt(41), b= sqrt(80), c= sqrt(89).\n\nI can use Heron's formula.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, s = [sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)] / 2.\n\nBut that's going to be messy. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area using another formula, like 1/2 * base * height, but I don't know the height.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the area using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nBut that's Heron's formula squared.\n\nWait, let's compute Heron's formula step by step.\n\nCompute s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.\n\nBut this will be messy, but let's compute the terms:\n\nCompute (a + b + c) = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)\n\nCompute (-a + b + c) = -sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)\n\nCompute (a - b + c) = sqrt(41) - sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)\n\nCompute (a + b - c) = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) - sqrt(89)\n\nMultiplying these four terms together would be complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, since the triangle is part of the tetrahedron, perhaps we can compute the area via vectors or coordinates.\n\nWait, another approach: since all edges are known, maybe we can find the area using the cross product if we assign coordinates to the points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the area by noting that the triangle is a right triangle. Let me check if that's the case.\n\nCompute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 and see if it equals c\u00b2.\n\na\u00b2 =41, b\u00b2=80, c\u00b2=89.\n\n41 +80=121, which is not equal to 89. So, not a right triangle.\n\nHmm, another thought: maybe compute the area using the formula involving the sides and the volume? Wait, no, that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the area via the formula:\n\nArea = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)^2 - 4(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)^2 )) / 4\n\nWait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe use the cosine law to find one angle and then compute the area as (1/2)ab sin(theta).\n\nLet me try that.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines to find angle opposite to c (sqrt(89)):\n\ncos(theta) = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)/(2ab)\n\n= (41 + 80 -89)/(2*sqrt(41)*sqrt(80))\n\n= (32)/(2*sqrt(41*80)) = 16 / sqrt(3280)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3280):\n\n3280 = 16*205 =16*5*41. So sqrt(3280)=4*sqrt(205).\n\nSo, cos(theta)=16/(4*sqrt(205))=4/sqrt(205)\n\nThen, sin(theta)=sqrt(1 - (16/205))=sqrt(189/205)=sqrt(189)/sqrt(205)= (3*sqrt(21))/sqrt(205)\n\nSo, area = (1/2)*a*b*sin(theta) = (1/2)*sqrt(41)*sqrt(80)*(3*sqrt(21)/sqrt(205))\n\nSimplify:\n\nsqrt(41)*sqrt(80) = sqrt(41*80)=sqrt(3280)=4*sqrt(205) as before.\n\nSo, area = (1/2)*4*sqrt(205) * (3*sqrt(21)/sqrt(205)) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1/2)*4=2, sqrt(205) cancels with 1/sqrt(205), leaving 2*3*sqrt(21)=6*sqrt(21)\n\nSo, area of one face is 6*sqrt(21).\n\nTherefore, total surface area S =4*6*sqrt(21)=24*sqrt(21).\n\nSo, S=24\u221a21.\n\nAlright, so now I have V=160/3 and S=24\u221a21.\n\nThe inradius r=3V/S.\n\nSo, compute r= 3*(160/3)/(24\u221a21)= (160)/(24\u221a21)= (20)/(3\u221a21)\n\nRationalizing the denominator: (20\u221a21)/(3*21)= (20\u221a21)/(63)\n\nSo, r=20\u221a21/63.\n\nSimplify: check if 20 and 63 have common factors. 20=2\u00b2*5, 63=7*3\u00b2. No common factors, so m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nBut wait, let me check if the fraction can be reduced. 20 and 63 are coprime? Yes, because 20's prime factors are 2 and 5, and 63's are 3 and 7. So, yes, 20 and 63 are coprime. Also, n=21 is square-free because 21=3*7, no square factors. So, the expression is in the simplest form.\n\nTherefore, m=20, n=21, p=63. So, m +n +p=20+21+63=104.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations, especially the area of the face. Because if that's wrong, everything else is off.\n\nEarlier, when computing the area using the Law of Cosines, I had:\n\nArea = (1/2)*a*b*sin(theta) = (1/2)*sqrt(41)*sqrt(80)*(3*sqrt(21)/sqrt(205)).\n\nWhich simplified to 6*sqrt(21). Let me recheck that.\n\nsqrt(41)*sqrt(80)=sqrt(41*80)=sqrt(3280)=sqrt(16*205)=4*sqrt(205). Correct.\n\nSo, (1/2)*4*sqrt(205)=2*sqrt(205). Then, multiplied by (3*sqrt(21)/sqrt(205)).\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(205) * 3*sqrt(21)/sqrt(205)=2*3*sqrt(21)=6*sqrt(21). Correct.\n\nSo, the area is indeed 6\u221a21, so total surface area 24\u221a21. Correct.\n\nThen, volume was 160/3. So, 3V/S= (3*(160/3))/(24\u221a21)=160/(24\u221a21)=20/(3\u221a21)=20\u221a21/(63). Correct.\n\nSo, yes, r=20\u221a21/63, so m=20, n=21, p=63. Sum is 20+21+63=104.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n\nThe tetrahedron has opposite edges equal: \\(AB = CD = \\sqrt{41}\\), \\(AC = BD = \\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(BC = AD = \\sqrt{89}\\). This symmetry implies it is a disphenoid with congruent faces. \n\nTo find the inradius \\(r\\), we use the formula \\(r = \\frac{3V}{S}\\), where \\(V\\) is the volume and \\(S\\) is the total surface area.\n\n**Volume Calculation:**\nUsing the Cayley-Menger determinant:\n\\[\nV = \\sqrt{\\frac{|\\text{det}(CM)|}{288}}\n\\]\nThe determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix is computed to be 819,200, leading to:\n\\[\nV = \\sqrt{\\frac{819200}{288}} = \\frac{160}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Surface Area Calculation:**\nEach face is a triangle with sides \\(\\sqrt{41}\\), \\(\\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{89}\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter I to each face. The distance should be in the form m\u221an / p, and then I need to find m + n + p.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize the tetrahedron. It's given that AB = CD = \u221a41, AC = BD = \u221a80, and BC = AD = \u221a89. Hmm, that's interesting. It seems like the opposite edges are equal. So, AB equals CD, AC equals BD, and BC equals AD. That might mean the tetrahedron is isosceles or something like that.\n\nWait, I remember that in a tetrahedron, if all opposite edges are equal, it's called a disphenoid. So, ABCD is a disphenoid. That might be useful because disphenoids have some special properties, like the fact that all four faces are congruent triangles. Or maybe not exactly congruent, but they have some symmetry.\n\nBut wait, no. Let me double-check. In a disphenoid, the opposite edges are equal, which is the case here. So, yes, ABCD is a disphenoid. That should help because disphenoids have an incenter, which is equidistant from all faces, so point I is that incenter.\n\nThe inradius can be found using the formula: inradius = 3 * volume / surface area. That formula comes from the fact that the volume is equal to (1/3) * surface area * inradius, so rearranged, inradius = 3V / A, where V is the volume and A is the total surface area.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Calculate the volume of the tetrahedron.\n2. Calculate the total surface area.\n3. Use the formula inradius = 3V / A.\n\nBut to do that, I need to find the volume and surface area. Since it's a disphenoid, maybe there's a formula for the volume in terms of its edges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to make calculations easier.\n\nLet me try that approach. Let me assign coordinates to the vertices such that calculations are manageable.\n\nSince opposite edges are equal, maybe I can place the points symmetrically.\n\nLet me set point A at (a, b, c), point B at (-a, -b, c), point C at (-a, b, -c), and point D at (a, -b, -c). This way, the coordinates are symmetric, which might make the edge lengths work out.\n\nWait, let me check if this setup would give the required edge lengths.\n\nCompute AB: distance between A(a,b,c) and B(-a,-b,c).\n\nDistance AB = sqrt[ (a - (-a))\u00b2 + (b - (-b))\u00b2 + (c - c)\u00b2 ] = sqrt[ (2a)\u00b2 + (2b)\u00b2 + 0 ] = sqrt(4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2) = 2\u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). But AB is given as \u221a41, so 2\u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = \u221a41. Squaring both sides: 4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 41 => a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nSimilarly, compute AC: distance between A(a,b,c) and C(-a,b,-c).\n\nDistance AC = sqrt[ (a - (-a))\u00b2 + (b - b)\u00b2 + (c - (-c))\u00b2 ] = sqrt[ (2a)\u00b2 + 0 + (2c)\u00b2 ] = sqrt(4a\u00b2 + 4c\u00b2) = 2\u221a(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2). Given AC is \u221a80, so 2\u221a(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = \u221a80. Squaring: 4(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 80 => a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, compute AD: distance between A(a,b,c) and D(a,-b,-c).\n\nDistance AD = sqrt[ (a - a)\u00b2 + (b - (-b))\u00b2 + (c - (-c))\u00b2 ] = sqrt[ 0 + (2b)\u00b2 + (2c)\u00b2 ] = sqrt(4b\u00b2 + 4c\u00b2) = 2\u221a(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2). Given AD is \u221a89, so 2\u221a(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = \u221a89. Squaring: 4(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 89 => b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo now I have three equations:\n\n1. a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4\n2. a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20\n3. b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nLet me write them down:\n\nEquation 1: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4\nEquation 2: a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20\nEquation 3: b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nI can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2: (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4 => c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (80/4 - 41/4) = 39/4.\n\nBut from Equation 3: b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4. So, now I have:\n\nc\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 39/4\nc\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nLet me add these two equations: 2c\u00b2 = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32. So, c\u00b2 = 16 => c = 4 or c = -4. Let's take c = 4 for simplicity.\n\nNow, from Equation 2: a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20 => a\u00b2 = 20 - 16 = 4 => a = 2 or a = -2. Let's take a = 2.\n\nFrom Equation 1: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4 => 4 + b\u00b2 = 41/4 => b\u00b2 = 41/4 - 16/4 = 25/4 => b = 5/2 or b = -5/2. Let's take b = 5/2.\n\nSo, the coordinates are:\n\nA: (2, 5/2, 4)\nB: (-2, -5/2, 4)\nC: (-2, 5/2, -4)\nD: (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nWait, let me double-check these assignments.\n\nPoint A: (a, b, c) = (2, 5/2, 4)\nPoint B: (-a, -b, c) = (-2, -5/2, 4)\nPoint C: (-a, b, -c) = (-2, 5/2, -4)\nPoint D: (a, -b, -c) = (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nYes, that looks correct.\n\nNow, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron.\n\nOne way to compute the volume of a tetrahedron given coordinates is to use the scalar triple product formula. The volume is (1/6) times the absolute value of the scalar triple product of vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nBut wait, in this case, since all the points are defined with coordinates, maybe it's easier to compute the volume using the determinant method.\n\nLet me recall that the formula for the volume is |det(B - A, C - A, D - A)| / 6.\n\nSo, first, compute vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nWait, actually, the vectors should be from the same vertex. Let's choose vertex A as the origin for this purpose.\n\nWait, no. The vectors should be from A to B, A to C, and A to D.\n\nWait, no, actually, the scalar triple product is (B - A) \u00b7 [(C - A) \u00d7 (D - A)].\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, let me compute vectors AB, AC, AD:\n\nWait, actually, AB is from A to B, which is B - A.\n\nSimilarly, AC is C - A, and AD is D - A.\n\nSo, let's compute these vectors.\n\nPoint A: (2, 5/2, 4)\nPoint B: (-2, -5/2, 4)\nPoint C: (-2, 5/2, -4)\nPoint D: (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nVector AB = B - A = (-2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, 4 - 4) = (-4, -5, 0)\nVector AC = C - A = (-2 - 2, 5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (-4, 0, -8)\nVector AD = D - A = (2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (0, -5, -8)\n\nNow, compute the scalar triple product: AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD)\n\nFirst, compute the cross product of AC and AD.\n\nLet me denote AC as vector u = (-4, 0, -8)\nAD as vector v = (0, -5, -8)\n\nCompute u \u00d7 v:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n|-4\u00a0\u00a0 0\u00a0\u00a0-8|\n|0\u00a0\u00a0 -5\u00a0 -8|\n\n= i*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)\n= i*(0 - 40) - j*(32 - 0) + k*(20 - 0)\n= (-40)i -32j +20k\nSo, u \u00d7 v = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nNow, compute AB \u00b7 (u \u00d7 v)\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\nDot product with (-40, -32, 20):\n\n(-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320\n\nSo, the scalar triple product is 320. The volume is |320| / 6 = 320/6 = 160/3.\n\nWait, that seems a bit large. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, cross product:\n\nu \u00d7 v = |i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |-4\u00a0\u00a0 0\u00a0\u00a0-8|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |0\u00a0\u00a0 -5\u00a0 -8|\n\nCalculating:\n\ni*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) = i*(0 - 40) = -40i\nj*( - [ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ]) = j*( - [32 - 0]) = -32j\nk*( (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 ) = k*(20 - 0) =20k\n\nYes, that's correct. So cross product is (-40, -32, 20).\n\nThen, AB \u00b7 (u \u00d7 v):\n\nAB is (-4, -5, 0). So,\n\n(-4)*(-40) = 160\n(-5)*(-32) = 160\n0*20 = 0\n\nTotal: 160 + 160 = 320.\n\nSo, volume is 320 / 6 = 160/3. Hmm, okay.\n\nNow, moving on to compute the surface area.\n\nSince it's a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent? Wait, no, not necessarily congruent, but opposite faces have equal areas.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid, opposite faces are congruent. So, the four faces come in two congruent pairs. So, two opposite faces have area equal to each other, and the other two opposite faces have another equal area.\n\nSo, perhaps I can compute the area of one face from each pair and double them.\n\nBut let me check if all faces are congruent. Wait, in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent if it's a regular tetrahedron, but in this case, the edges are not all equal, so faces are not congruent. So, opposite faces are congruent, but not all four.\n\nSo, let me compute the areas of the faces.\n\nFirst, I need to compute the areas of triangles ABC, ABD, ACD, and BCD.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the area of each face using Heron's formula.\n\nBut for Heron's formula, I need the lengths of the sides of each triangle.\n\nWait, for triangle ABC, the sides are AB, AC, and BC.\n\nWe already know AB = \u221a41, AC = \u221a80, and BC = \u221a89.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle ABD: sides AB = \u221a41, AD = \u221a89, BD = \u221a80.\n\nFor triangle ACD: sides AC = \u221a80, AD = \u221a89, CD = \u221a41.\n\nFor triangle BCD: sides BC = \u221a89, BD = \u221a80, CD = \u221a41.\n\nSo, each face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, all four faces are congruent triangles? Because each has sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nFace ABC: AB = \u221a41, AC = \u221a80, BC = \u221a89.\n\nFace ABD: AB = \u221a41, AD = \u221a89, BD = \u221a80.\n\nFace ACD: AC = \u221a80, AD = \u221a89, CD = \u221a41.\n\nFace BCD: BC = \u221a89, BD = \u221a80, CD = \u221a41.\n\nYes, each face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. So, all four faces are congruent triangles.\n\nSo, all four faces have the same area. That's helpful because then the total surface area is 4 times the area of one face.\n\nSo, let's compute the area of one face using Heron's formula.\n\nLet me denote the sides as a = \u221a41, b = \u221a80, c = \u221a89.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nBut Heron's formula is \u221a[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].\n\nBut since the sides are square roots, it might get messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the area using vectors or coordinates.\n\nWait, since I have coordinates for all the points, maybe it's easier to compute the area of one face using the cross product.\n\nFor example, take face ABC. Points A, B, C.\n\nVectors AB and AC are already computed earlier.\n\nWait, AB was vector (-4, -5, 0), AC was (-4, 0, -8).\n\nWait, no, AB is from A to B, but for computing the area of triangle ABC, perhaps it's better to compute vectors AB and AC and then compute half the magnitude of their cross product.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, vectors AB and AC are:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCompute the cross product AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nWait, actually, the area is (1/2) |AB \u00d7 AC|.\n\nSo, let's compute AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCross product:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n|-4\u00a0 -5\u00a0\u00a0 0|\n|-4\u00a0\u00a0 0\u00a0\u00a0-8|\n\n= i*(-5*(-8) - 0*0) - j*(-4*(-8) - 0*(-4)) + k*(-4*0 - (-5)*(-4))\n= i*(40 - 0) - j*(32 - 0) + k*(0 - 20)\n= 40i -32j -20k\n\nSo, AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)\u00b2 + (-20)\u00b2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024).\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\nFactor 3024: Let's divide by 16: 3024 / 16 = 189.\n\nSo, 3024 = 16 * 189.\n\n189 = 9 * 21 = 9 * 3 * 7.\n\nSo, 3024 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7 = 16 * 9 * 21.\n\nSo, sqrt(3024) = sqrt(16 * 9 * 21) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12\u221a21.\n\nSo, the magnitude is 12\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12\u221a21 = 6\u221a21.\n\nSince all four faces are congruent, the total surface area is 4 * 6\u221a21 = 24\u221a21.\n\nNow, I have the volume V = 160/3 and the surface area A = 24\u221a21.\n\nNow, the inradius r = 3V / A.\n\nCompute 3V = 3*(160/3) = 160.\n\nSo, r = 160 / (24\u221a21) = (160 / 24) / \u221a21.\n\nSimplify 160 / 24: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 20 / 3.\n\nSo, r = (20/3) / \u221a21 = 20 / (3\u221a21).\n\nRationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21:\n\nr = (20\u221a21) / (3*21) = (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nSo, the inradius is 20\u221a21 / 63.\n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation.\n\nWait, 3V is 3*(160/3) = 160. Then, 160 divided by (24\u221a21) is (160)/(24\u221a21). Simplify 160/24: 160 \u00f7 8 = 20; 24 \u00f7 8 = 3. So, 20/3. So, 20/(3\u221a21). Then, rationalize: multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21: 20\u221a21 / (3*21) = 20\u221a21 / 63. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the distance from I to each face is 20\u221a21 / 63. So, m = 20, n = 21, p = 63.\n\nWait, but wait: 63 and 20 are coprime? 63 factors into 7*3*3. 20 is 2*2*5. No common factors, so yes, m and p are coprime. Also, n=21 is square-free (since 21=3*7, no square factors). So, that fits the form.\n\nSo, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I do the surface area correctly? Because when I computed the cross product for the area of triangle ABC, I got 12\u221a21, so the area is 6\u221a21. Then, four faces give 24\u221a21. That seems correct.\n\nAnd the volume was 160/3. Then, 3V is 160, and 160 divided by 24\u221a21 is 20/(3\u221a21) which is 20\u221a21/63. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 20\u221a21 /63, so m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we first recognize that the tetrahedron \\(ABCD\\) is a disphenoid, meaning its opposite edges are equal. This symmetry allows us to place the vertices in a coordinate system for easier computation.\n\nWe assign coordinates to the vertices as follows:\n- \\(A(2, \\frac{5}{2}, 4)\\)\n- \\(B(-2, -\\frac{5}{2}, 4)\\)\n- \\(C(-2, \\frac{5}{2}, -4)\\)\n- \\(D(2, -\\frac{5}{2}, -4)\\)\n\nUsing these coordinates, we compute the volume of the tetrahedron using the scalar triple product of vectors from vertex \\(A\\):\n- Vectors: \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} = (-4, -5, 0)\\), \\(\\overrightarrow{AC} = (-4, 0, -8)\\), \\(\\overrightarrow{AD} = (0, -5, -8)\\)\n- Cross product \\(\\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD} = (-40, -32, 20)\\)\n- Dot product \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} \\cdot (\\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD}) = 320\\)\n- Volume \\(V = \\frac{1}{6} |320| = \\frac{160}{3}\\)\n\nNext, we calculate the surface area.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter I to each face. The distance should be in the form m\u221an / p, and then I need to find m + n + p.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize the tetrahedron. It's given that AB = CD = \u221a41, AC = BD = \u221a80, and BC = AD = \u221a89. Hmm, that's interesting. It seems like the opposite edges are equal. So, AB equals CD, AC equals BD, and BC equals AD. That might mean the tetrahedron is isosceles or something like that.\n\nWait, I remember that in a tetrahedron, if all opposite edges are equal, it's called a disphenoid. So, ABCD is a disphenoid. That might be useful because disphenoids have some special properties, like the fact that all four faces are congruent triangles. Or maybe not exactly congruent, but they have some symmetry.\n\nBut wait, no. Let me double-check. In a disphenoid, the opposite edges are equal, which is the case here. So, yes, ABCD is a disphenoid. That should help because disphenoids have an incenter, which is equidistant from all faces, so point I is that incenter.\n\nThe inradius can be found using the formula: inradius = 3 * volume / surface area. That formula comes from the fact that the volume is equal to (1/3) * surface area * inradius, so rearranged, inradius = 3V / A, where V is the volume and A is the total surface area.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Calculate the volume of the tetrahedron.\n2. Calculate the total surface area.\n3. Use the formula inradius = 3V / A.\n\nBut to do that, I need to find the volume and surface area. Since it's a disphenoid, maybe there's a formula for the volume in terms of its edges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to make calculations easier.\n\nLet me try that approach. Let me assign coordinates to the vertices such that calculations are manageable.\n\nSince opposite edges are equal, maybe I can place the points symmetrically.\n\nLet me set point A at (a, b, c), point B at (-a, -b, c), point C at (-a, b, -c), and point D at (a, -b, -c). This way, the coordinates are symmetric, which might make the edge lengths work out.\n\nWait, let me check if this setup would give the required edge lengths.\n\nCompute AB: distance between A(a,b,c) and B(-a,-b,c).\n\nDistance AB = sqrt[ (a - (-a))\u00b2 + (b - (-b))\u00b2 + (c - c)\u00b2 ] = sqrt[ (2a)\u00b2 + (2b)\u00b2 + 0 ] = sqrt(4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2) = 2\u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). But AB is given as \u221a41, so 2\u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = \u221a41. Squaring both sides: 4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 41 => a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nSimilarly, compute AC: distance between A(a,b,c) and C(-a,b,-c).\n\nDistance AC = sqrt[ (a - (-a))\u00b2 + (b - b)\u00b2 + (c - (-c))\u00b2 ] = sqrt[ (2a)\u00b2 + 0 + (2c)\u00b2 ] = sqrt(4a\u00b2 + 4c\u00b2) = 2\u221a(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2). Given AC is \u221a80, so 2\u221a(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = \u221a80. Squaring: 4(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 80 => a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, compute AD: distance between A(a,b,c) and D(a,-b,-c).\n\nDistance AD = sqrt[ (a - a)\u00b2 + (b - (-b))\u00b2 + (c - (-c))\u00b2 ] = sqrt[ 0 + (2b)\u00b2 + (2c)\u00b2 ] = sqrt(4b\u00b2 + 4c\u00b2) = 2\u221a(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2). Given AD is \u221a89, so 2\u221a(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = \u221a89. Squaring: 4(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 89 => b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo now I have three equations:\n\n1. a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4\n2. a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20\n3. b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nLet me write them down:\n\nEquation 1: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4\nEquation 2: a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20\nEquation 3: b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nI can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2: (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4 => c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (80/4 - 41/4) = 39/4.\n\nBut from Equation 3: b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4. So, now I have:\n\nc\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 39/4\nc\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nLet me add these two equations: 2c\u00b2 = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32. So, c\u00b2 = 16 => c = 4 or c = -4. Let's take c = 4 for simplicity.\n\nNow, from Equation 2: a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20 => a\u00b2 = 20 - 16 = 4 => a = 2 or a = -2. Let's take a = 2.\n\nFrom Equation 1: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4 => 4 + b\u00b2 = 41/4 => b\u00b2 = 41/4 - 16/4 = 25/4 => b = 5/2 or b = -5/2. Let's take b = 5/2.\n\nSo, the coordinates are:\n\nA: (2, 5/2, 4)\nB: (-2, -5/2, 4)\nC: (-2, 5/2, -4)\nD: (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nWait, let me double-check these assignments.\n\nPoint A: (a, b, c) = (2, 5/2, 4)\nPoint B: (-a, -b, c) = (-2, -5/2, 4)\nPoint C: (-a, b, -c) = (-2, 5/2, -4)\nPoint D: (a, -b, -c) = (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nYes, that looks correct.\n\nNow, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron.\n\nOne way to compute the volume of a tetrahedron given coordinates is to use the scalar triple product formula. The volume is (1/6) times the absolute value of the scalar triple product of vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nBut wait, in this case, since all the points are defined with coordinates, maybe it's easier to compute the volume using the determinant method.\n\nLet me recall that the formula for the volume is |det(B - A, C - A, D - A)| / 6.\n\nSo, first, compute vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nWait, actually, the vectors should be from the same vertex. Let's choose vertex A as the origin for this purpose.\n\nWait, no. The vectors should be from A to B, A to C, and A to D.\n\nWait, no, actually, the scalar triple product is (B - A) \u00b7 [(C - A) \u00d7 (D - A)].\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, let me compute vectors AB, AC, AD:\n\nWait, actually, AB is from A to B, which is B - A.\n\nSimilarly, AC is C - A, and AD is D - A.\n\nSo, let's compute these vectors.\n\nPoint A: (2, 5/2, 4)\nPoint B: (-2, -5/2, 4)\nPoint C: (-2, 5/2, -4)\nPoint D: (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nVector AB = B - A = (-2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, 4 - 4) = (-4, -5, 0)\nVector AC = C - A = (-2 - 2, 5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (-4, 0, -8)\nVector AD = D - A = (2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (0, -5, -8)\n\nNow, compute the scalar triple product: AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD)\n\nFirst, compute the cross product of AC and AD.\n\nLet me denote AC as vector u = (-4, 0, -8)\nAD as vector v = (0, -5, -8)\n\nCompute u \u00d7 v:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n|-4\u00a0\u00a0 0\u00a0\u00a0-8|\n|0\u00a0\u00a0 -5\u00a0 -8|\n\n= i*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)\n= i*(0 - 40) - j*(32 - 0) + k*(20 - 0)\n= (-40)i -32j +20k\nSo, u \u00d7 v = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nNow, compute AB \u00b7 (u \u00d7 v)\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\nDot product with (-40, -32, 20):\n\n(-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320\n\nSo, the scalar triple product is 320. The volume is |320| / 6 = 320/6 = 160/3.\n\nWait, that seems a bit large. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, cross product:\n\nu \u00d7 v = |i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |-4\u00a0\u00a0 0\u00a0\u00a0-8|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |0\u00a0\u00a0 -5\u00a0 -8|\n\nCalculating:\n\ni*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) = i*(0 - 40) = -40i\nj*( - [ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ]) = j*( - [32 - 0]) = -32j\nk*( (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 ) = k*(20 - 0) =20k\n\nYes, that's correct. So cross product is (-40, -32, 20).\n\nThen, AB \u00b7 (u \u00d7 v):\n\nAB is (-4, -5, 0). So,\n\n(-4)*(-40) = 160\n(-5)*(-32) = 160\n0*20 = 0\n\nTotal: 160 + 160 = 320.\n\nSo, volume is 320 / 6 = 160/3. Hmm, okay.\n\nNow, moving on to compute the surface area.\n\nSince it's a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent? Wait, no, not necessarily congruent, but opposite faces have equal areas.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid, opposite faces are congruent. So, the four faces come in two congruent pairs. So, two opposite faces have area equal to each other, and the other two opposite faces have another equal area.\n\nSo, perhaps I can compute the area of one face from each pair and double them.\n\nBut let me check if all faces are congruent. Wait, in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent if it's a regular tetrahedron, but in this case, the edges are not all equal, so faces are not congruent. So, opposite faces are congruent, but not all four.\n\nSo, let me compute the areas of the faces.\n\nFirst, I need to compute the areas of triangles ABC, ABD, ACD, and BCD.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the area of each face using Heron's formula.\n\nBut for Heron's formula, I need the lengths of the sides of each triangle.\n\nWait, for triangle ABC, the sides are AB, AC, and BC.\n\nWe already know AB = \u221a41, AC = \u221a80, and BC = \u221a89.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle ABD: sides AB = \u221a41, AD = \u221a89, BD = \u221a80.\n\nFor triangle ACD: sides AC = \u221a80, AD = \u221a89, CD = \u221a41.\n\nFor triangle BCD: sides BC = \u221a89, BD = \u221a80, CD = \u221a41.\n\nSo, each face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, all four faces are congruent triangles? Because each has sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nFace ABC: AB = \u221a41, AC = \u221a80, BC = \u221a89.\n\nFace ABD: AB = \u221a41, AD = \u221a89, BD = \u221a80.\n\nFace ACD: AC = \u221a80, AD = \u221a89, CD = \u221a41.\n\nFace BCD: BC = \u221a89, BD = \u221a80, CD = \u221a41.\n\nYes, each face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. So, all four faces are congruent triangles.\n\nSo, all four faces have the same area. That's helpful because then the total surface area is 4 times the area of one face.\n\nSo, let's compute the area of one face using Heron's formula.\n\nLet me denote the sides as a = \u221a41, b = \u221a80, c = \u221a89.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nBut Heron's formula is \u221a[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].\n\nBut since the sides are square roots, it might get messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the area using vectors or coordinates.\n\nWait, since I have coordinates for all the points, maybe it's easier to compute the area of one face using the cross product.\n\nFor example, take face ABC. Points A, B, C.\n\nVectors AB and AC are already computed earlier.\n\nWait, AB was vector (-4, -5, 0), AC was (-4, 0, -8).\n\nWait, no, AB is from A to B, but for computing the area of triangle ABC, perhaps it's better to compute vectors AB and AC and then compute half the magnitude of their cross product.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, vectors AB and AC are:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCompute the cross product AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nWait, actually, the area is (1/2) |AB \u00d7 AC|.\n\nSo, let's compute AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCross product:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n|-4\u00a0 -5\u00a0\u00a0 0|\n|-4\u00a0\u00a0 0\u00a0\u00a0-8|\n\n= i*(-5*(-8) - 0*0) - j*(-4*(-8) - 0*(-4)) + k*(-4*0 - (-5)*(-4))\n= i*(40 - 0) - j*(32 - 0) + k*(0 - 20)\n= 40i -32j -20k\n\nSo, AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)\u00b2 + (-20)\u00b2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024).\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\nFactor 3024: Let's divide by 16: 3024 / 16 = 189.\n\nSo, 3024 = 16 * 189.\n\n189 = 9 * 21 = 9 * 3 * 7.\n\nSo, 3024 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7 = 16 * 9 * 21.\n\nSo, sqrt(3024) = sqrt(16 * 9 * 21) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12\u221a21.\n\nSo, the magnitude is 12\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12\u221a21 = 6\u221a21.\n\nSince all four faces are congruent, the total surface area is 4 * 6\u221a21 = 24\u221a21.\n\nNow, I have the volume V = 160/3 and the surface area A = 24\u221a21.\n\nNow, the inradius r = 3V / A.\n\nCompute 3V = 3*(160/3) = 160.\n\nSo, r = 160 / (24\u221a21) = (160 / 24) / \u221a21.\n\nSimplify 160 / 24: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 20 / 3.\n\nSo, r = (20/3) / \u221a21 = 20 / (3\u221a21).\n\nRationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21:\n\nr = (20\u221a21) / (3*21) = (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nSo, the inradius is 20\u221a21 / 63.\n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation.\n\nWait, 3V is 3*(160/3) = 160. Then, 160 divided by (24\u221a21) is (160)/(24\u221a21). Simplify 160/24: 160 \u00f7 8 = 20; 24 \u00f7 8 = 3. So, 20/3. So, 20/(3\u221a21). Then, rationalize: multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21: 20\u221a21 / (3*21) = 20\u221a21 / 63. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the distance from I to each face is 20\u221a21 / 63. So, m = 20, n = 21, p = 63.\n\nWait, but wait: 63 and 20 are coprime? 63 factors into 7*3*3. 20 is 2*2*5. No common factors, so yes, m and p are coprime. Also, n=21 is square-free (since 21=3*7, no square factors). So, that fits the form.\n\nSo, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I do the surface area correctly? Because when I computed the cross product for the area of triangle ABC, I got 12\u221a21, so the area is 6\u221a21. Then, four faces give 24\u221a21. That seems correct.\n\nAnd the volume was 160/3. Then, 3V is 160, and 160 divided by 24\u221a21 is 20/(3\u221a21) which is 20\u221a21/63. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 20\u221a21 /63, so m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first recognize that the tetrahedron \\(ABCD\\) is a disphenoid, meaning its opposite edges are equal. This symmetry allows us to place the vertices in a coordinate system for easier computation.\n\nWe assign coordinates to the vertices as follows:\n- \\(A(2, \\frac{5}{2}, 4)\\)\n- \\(B(-2, -\\frac{5}{2}, 4)\\)\n- \\(C(-2, \\frac{5}{2}, -4)\\)\n- \\(D(2, -\\frac{5}{2}, -4)\\)\n\nUsing these coordinates, we compute the volume of the tetrahedron using the scalar triple product of vectors from vertex \\(A\\):\n- Vectors: \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} = (-4, -5, 0)\\), \\(\\overrightarrow{AC} = (-4, 0, -8)\\), \\(\\overrightarrow{AD} = (0, -5, -8)\\)\n- Cross product \\(\\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD} = (-40, -32, 20)\\)\n- Dot product \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} \\cdot (\\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD}) = 320\\)\n- Volume \\(V = \\frac{1}{6} |320| = \\frac{160}{3}\\)\n\nNext, we calculate the surface area. Each face of the tetrahedron is a triangle with sides \\(\\sqrt{41}\\), \\(\\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{89}\\). Using Heron's formula or the cross product method, the area of one face is found to be \\(6\\sqrt{21}\\). Since there are four congruent faces, the total surface area is \\(4 \\times 6\\sqrt{21} = 24\\sqrt{21}\\).\n\nThe inradius \\(r\\) is given by \\(r = \\frac{3V}{A}\\):\n- \\(3V = 3 \\times \\frac{160}{3} = 160\\)\n- \\(r = \\frac{160}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20}{3\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}\\)\n\nThus, the distance from the incenter \\(I\\) to each face is \\(\\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}\\). The values \\(m = 20\\), \\(n = 21\\), and \\(p = 63\\) satisfy the given conditions, leading to \\(m + n + p = 104\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{104}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given as AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the faces are all equal. I need to find this distance, which is expressed in the form m\u221an / p, and then find m + n + p.\n\nHmm, first, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is called the inradius.\n\nSo, the key here is to find the inradius of this tetrahedron. To do that, I think I need the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area. Because the formula for the inradius r is 3 times the volume V divided by the total surface area S, right? So, r = 3V / S.\n\nBut wait, I'm not 100% sure about that formula. Let me think. In a triangle, the inradius is area divided by semiperimeter. For a tetrahedron, it's similar but in three dimensions. The formula is indeed r = 3V / S, where S is the total surface area. So, I need to find V and S.\n\nFirst, let's compute the volume V. To compute the volume of a tetrahedron, I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant. Since all the edges are given, this might be the way to go.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is:\n\nV = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the matrix:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   a\u00b2  b\u00b2  c\u00b2 |\n| 1  a\u00b2   0   d\u00b2  e\u00b2 |\n| 1  b\u00b2  d\u00b2   0   f\u00b2 |\n| 1  c\u00b2  e\u00b2  f\u00b2   0  |\n\nSo, let me assign the given lengths to a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\nWait, let's make sure which edges correspond to which lengths. The problem says:\n\nAB = CD = sqrt(41), so AB = sqrt(41), CD = sqrt(41).\n\nAC = BD = sqrt(80), so AC = sqrt(80), BD = sqrt(80).\n\nBC = AD = sqrt(89), so BC = sqrt(89), AD = sqrt(89).\n\nBut in the Cayley-Menger determinant, the edges are AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD.\n\nSo:\n\na = AB = sqrt(41)\n\nb = AC = sqrt(80)\n\nc = AD = sqrt(89)\n\nd = BC = sqrt(89)\n\ne = BD = sqrt(80)\n\nf = CD = sqrt(41)\n\nSo, let me square all these to plug into the determinant:\n\na\u00b2 = 41\n\nb\u00b2 = 80\n\nc\u00b2 = 89\n\nd\u00b2 = 89\n\ne\u00b2 = 80\n\nf\u00b2 = 41\n\nNow, the Cayley-Menger matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the Cayley-Menger determinant, the matrix is 5x5, with the first row and column being 0,1,1,1,1 and the first element is 0. The other rows and columns are the squares of the edge lengths.\n\nSo, positions:\n\nCM[0][0] = 0\n\nCM[0][1] = CM[0][2] = CM[0][3] = CM[0][4] = 1\n\nCM[1][0] = 1\n\nCM[1][1] = 0\n\nCM[1][2] = a\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 = 41\n\nCM[1][3] = AC\u00b2 = b\u00b2 = 80\n\nCM[1][4] = AD\u00b2 = c\u00b2 = 89\n\nSimilarly,\n\nCM[2][0] = 1\n\nCM[2][1] = AB\u00b2 = 41\n\nCM[2][2] = 0\n\nCM[2][3] = BC\u00b2 = d\u00b2 = 89\n\nCM[2][4] = BD\u00b2 = e\u00b2 = 80\n\nCM[3][0] = 1\n\nCM[3][1] = AC\u00b2 = 80\n\nCM[3][2] = BC\u00b2 = 89\n\nCM[3][3] = 0\n\nCM[3][4] = CD\u00b2 = f\u00b2 = 41\n\nCM[4][0] = 1\n\nCM[4][1] = AD\u00b2 = 89\n\nCM[4][2] = BD\u00b2 = 80\n\nCM[4][3] = CD\u00b2 = 41\n\nCM[4][4] = 0\n\nSo, the matrix is correct as I wrote above.\n\nNow, the determinant of this matrix will give me 288 * V\u00b2, so V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ).\n\nI need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. That sounds daunting, but maybe there's some symmetry or pattern that can help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way, but I'm not sure. Let's try expanding the determinant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the determinant using some properties or by noticing that the matrix is symmetric.\n\nWait, perhaps the matrix has some symmetry because the edge lengths are arranged in a symmetric way. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the matrix:\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, each row after the first is a permutation of the others. Let me see:\n\nRow 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]\n\nRow 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80] which is row1 shifted?\n\nWait, no, not exactly. Wait, row2 is 1, then 41, 0, 89, 80.\n\nRow3 is 1, 80, 89, 0, 41.\n\nRow4 is 1, 89, 80, 41, 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps if I swap columns, I can make the matrix more symmetric.\n\nBut maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the determinant using some row or column operations to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that the tetrahedron is isohedral or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the tetrahedron is regular? No, because all edges are not equal. AB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a kind of symmetric tetrahedron, called a disphenoid, where opposite edges are equal.\n\nYes, exactly. In a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal. So in this case, AB = CD, AC = BD, AD = BC. So, this is a disphenoid.\n\nSo, maybe the volume formula for a disphenoid is simpler.\n\nWait, I recall that for a disphenoid, the volume can be computed using the formula:\n\nV = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / 72\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, that might be for a different kind of tetrahedron.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to compute the volume.\n\nLet me try that. Let me assign coordinates to the vertices.\n\nLet me put point A at (0, 0, 0).\n\nLet me put point B at (x, 0, 0).\n\nPoint C at (p, q, 0).\n\nPoint D at (r, s, t).\n\nNow, I need to assign coordinates such that all the given edge lengths are satisfied.\n\nBut this might get complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nSo, AB = sqrt(41). Since A is at (0,0,0) and B is at (x,0,0), the distance AB is |x - 0| = |x| = sqrt(41). So, x = sqrt(41). Let's set B at (sqrt(41), 0, 0).\n\nNow, AC = sqrt(80). Point C is at (p, q, 0). So, the distance AC is sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = sqrt(80). So, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 80.\n\nSimilarly, AD = sqrt(89). Point D is at (r, s, t). So, distance AD is sqrt(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2) = sqrt(89), so r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 = 89.\n\nNow, BC = sqrt(89). Point B is at (sqrt(41), 0, 0), point C is at (p, q, 0). So, distance BC is sqrt( (p - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + q\u00b2 ) = sqrt(89). So, (p - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 89.\n\nBut from AC, we have p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 80. So, subtracting these equations:\n\n(p - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 89 - 80 => (p\u00b2 - 2 p sqrt(41) + 41) + q\u00b2 - p\u00b2 - q\u00b2 = 9 => -2 p sqrt(41) + 41 = 9 => -2 p sqrt(41) = -32 => p = (32)/(2 sqrt(41)) = 16 / sqrt(41) = (16 sqrt(41))/41.\n\nSo, p = (16 sqrt(41))/41.\n\nNow, from AC: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 80.\n\nCompute p\u00b2:\n\n(16 sqrt(41)/41)^2 = (256 * 41) / (41^2) ) = (256 / 41).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 256 / 41.\n\nThen q\u00b2 = 80 - 256 / 41 = (80 * 41 - 256) / 41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024 / 41.\n\nSo, q = sqrt(3024 / 41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41). Let's see what 3024 is. 3024 divided by 16 is 189. 189 is 9*21, which is 9*3*7. So, sqrt(3024) = sqrt(16 * 189) = 4 sqrt(189) = 4 sqrt(9*21) = 4*3 sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21). So, q = 12 sqrt(21) / sqrt(41). Rationalizing, q = 12 sqrt(861) / 41? Wait, no, sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) is sqrt(861)/41? Wait, no, sqrt(a)/sqrt(b) = sqrt(ab)/b. So, sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) = sqrt(21*41)/41. 21*41 is 861. So, q = 12 sqrt(861) / 41.\n\nWait, but that seems complicated. Maybe I can leave it as sqrt(3024/41) for now.\n\nSo, point C is at (16 sqrt(41)/41, sqrt(3024/41), 0).\n\nNow, moving on to point D at (r, s, t). We have AD = sqrt(89), so r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 = 89.\n\nAlso, BD = sqrt(80). Point B is at (sqrt(41), 0, 0). So, distance BD is sqrt( (r - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 ) = sqrt(80). So, (r - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 = 80.\n\nBut we also know that AD is sqrt(89), so r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 = 89. Subtracting these two equations:\n\n(r - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 - (r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2) = 80 - 89 => (r\u00b2 - 2 r sqrt(41) + 41) + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 - r\u00b2 - s\u00b2 - t\u00b2 = -9 => -2 r sqrt(41) + 41 = -9 => -2 r sqrt(41) = -50 => r = 50 / (2 sqrt(41)) = 25 / sqrt(41) = (25 sqrt(41)) / 41.\n\nSo, r = 25 sqrt(41) / 41.\n\nNow, from AD: r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 = 89. Compute r\u00b2:\n\n(25 sqrt(41)/41)^2 = (625 * 41) / (41^2) ) = 625 / 41.\n\nSo, r\u00b2 = 625 / 41.\n\nThen, s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 = 89 - 625 / 41 = (89 * 41 - 625) / 41 = (3649 - 625)/41 = 3024 / 41.\n\nSo, s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 = 3024 / 41.\n\nNow, what else do we know about point D?\n\nWe know CD = sqrt(41). Point C is at (16 sqrt(41)/41, sqrt(3024/41), 0). Point D is at (25 sqrt(41)/41, s, t). So, the distance CD is sqrt( (25 sqrt(41)/41 - 16 sqrt(41)/41)^2 + (s - sqrt(3024/41))^2 + (t - 0)^2 ) = sqrt(41).\n\nCompute the x-coordinate difference: (25 sqrt(41) - 16 sqrt(41))/41 = (9 sqrt(41))/41. So, squared: (81 * 41) / (41^2) = 81 / 41.\n\nSo, distance CD squared is 81/41 + (s - sqrt(3024/41))^2 + t^2 = 41.\n\nSo, 81/41 + (s - sqrt(3024/41))^2 + t^2 = 41.\n\nMultiply both sides by 41:\n\n81 + 41*(s - sqrt(3024/41))^2 + 41 t^2 = 41*41 = 1681.\n\nBut we know from earlier that s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 = 3024 / 41. So, 41*(s\u00b2 + t\u00b2) = 3024.\n\nSo, let's expand (s - sqrt(3024/41))^2:\n\n= s\u00b2 - 2 s sqrt(3024/41) + 3024/41.\n\nMultiply by 41:\n\n41 s\u00b2 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) + 3024.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n81 + [41 s\u00b2 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) + 3024] + 41 t^2 = 1681.\n\nBut 41 s\u00b2 + 41 t^2 = 41*(s\u00b2 + t\u00b2) = 3024.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n81 + 3024 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) + 3024 = 1681.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me re-examine that.\n\nWait, I had:\n\n81 + [41 s\u00b2 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) + 3024] + 41 t^2 = 1681.\n\nBut 41 s\u00b2 + 41 t^2 = 3024.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n81 + (3024) - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) + 3024 = 1681.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 81 + 3024 + 3024 is 6129, which is way larger than 1681.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nWe have:\n\nDistance CD squared is 41.\n\nSo, 81/41 + (s - sqrt(3024/41))\u00b2 + t\u00b2 = 41.\n\nMultiply both sides by 41:\n\n81 + 41*(s - sqrt(3024/41))\u00b2 + 41 t\u00b2 = 1681.\n\nNow, expand (s - sqrt(3024/41))\u00b2:\n\n= s\u00b2 - 2 s sqrt(3024/41) + 3024/41.\n\nMultiply by 41:\n\n41 s\u00b2 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) + 3024.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n81 + 41 s\u00b2 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) + 3024 + 41 t\u00b2 = 1681.\n\nBut 41 s\u00b2 + 41 t\u00b2 = 41*(s\u00b2 + t\u00b2) = 41*(3024/41) = 3024.\n\nSo, substitute:\n\n81 + 3024 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) + 3024 = 1681.\n\nSo, 81 + 3024 + 3024 = 6129.\n\nSo, 6129 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) = 1681.\n\nThen, 6129 - 1681 = 2 s sqrt(3024*41).\n\nCompute 6129 - 1681: 6129 - 1600 = 4529, minus 81 more: 4529 -81=4448.\n\nSo, 4448 = 2 s sqrt(3024*41).\n\nDivide both sides by 2: 2224 = s sqrt(3024*41).\n\nSo, s = 2224 / sqrt(3024 *41).\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024*41).\n\nFactor 3024: 3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7. So, sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, sqrt(3024 * 41) = sqrt(3024) * sqrt(41) = 12 sqrt(21) * sqrt(41) = 12 sqrt(861).\n\nSo, s = 2224 / (12 sqrt(861)).\n\nSimplify 2224 / 12: 2224 \u00f7 4 = 556, 12 \u00f7 4 = 3. So, 556 / 3.\n\nSo, s = (556 / 3) / sqrt(861) = (556 / 3) / sqrt(861).\n\nRationalizing the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(861):\n\ns = (556 sqrt(861)) / (3 * 861).\n\nSimplify 861: 861 \u00f7 3 = 287. So, 3*861 = 2583.\n\nSo, s = (556 sqrt(861)) / 2583.\n\nSimplify 556 and 2583: Let's see if they have common factors. 2583 \u00f7 556 is about 4.64, so 556 is 4*139. 2583 \u00f7 139: 139*18=2502, 2583-2502=81, so no. So, perhaps 556 and 2583 have a common factor of something else? 556 is 4*139. 2583 \u00f7 139: 139*18=2502, 2583-2502=81. 81 \u00f7 139 is not an integer. So, no common factors. So, s = 556 sqrt(861) / 2583.\n\nWait, but this seems messy. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, from the equation:\n\n81 + 41*(s - sqrt(3024/41))\u00b2 + 41 t\u00b2 = 1681.\n\nBut 41*(s - sqrt(3024/41))\u00b2 + 41 t\u00b2 = 1681 -81=1600.\n\nBut 41*(s\u00b2 - 2 s sqrt(3024/41) + 3024/41) +41 t\u00b2 =1600.\n\nWhich is 41 s\u00b2 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) + 3024 +41 t\u00b2 =1600.\n\nBut 41 s\u00b2 +41 t\u00b2=3024.\n\nSo, substitute:\n\n3024 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) + 3024 =1600.\n\nWait, that would be 6048 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) =1600.\n\nSo, 6048 -1600=2 s sqrt(3024*41).\n\nSo, 4448=2 s sqrt(3024*41).\n\nThus, s=4448/(2 sqrt(3024*41))=2224/sqrt(3024*41).\n\nWhich is what I had before.\n\nSo, s=2224/sqrt(3024*41)=2224/(12 sqrt(861))=556/(3 sqrt(861)).\n\nSo, s=556 sqrt(861)/(3*861)=556 sqrt(861)/2583.\n\nSo, s= (556/2583) sqrt(861).\n\nHmm, 556 and 2583: 556 \u00f7 4=139, 2583 \u00f7 4=645.75, not integer. So, that's as simplified as it gets.\n\nNow, knowing that s\u00b2 + t\u00b2=3024/41, we can find t.\n\ns = (556 sqrt(861))/2583.\n\nCompute s\u00b2:\n\n(556^2 *861)/ (2583^2).\n\nBut 2583=3*861, so 2583=3*861.\n\nSo, s\u00b2=(556^2 *861)/(9 *861\u00b2)=556\u00b2/(9*861).\n\nSo, s\u00b2= (556\u00b2)/(9*861).\n\nThen, t\u00b2=3024/41 - s\u00b2.\n\nBut 3024/41 is approximately 73.756.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute t in terms of s.\n\nBut this is getting very messy. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of assigning coordinates, I can compute the volume another way.\n\nWait, since it's a disphenoid, maybe the volume can be calculated using the formula for a disphenoid.\n\nI recall that in a disphenoid, the volume is given by V = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / 72.\n\nWait, is that correct? Or is it a different formula.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's V = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / (something). Let me check.\n\nWait, I think the formula for the volume of a disphenoid is V = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / (8 * sqrt(2)).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is V = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / 72.\n\nWait, let me see if I can find the formula.\n\nUpon a quick check in my mind, I think for a disphenoid, which has four congruent faces, the volume can be computed using the formula involving the squares of the edges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant as I initially thought, even though it's a 5x5 determinant.\n\nSo, let's try that.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   41  80  89 |\n| 1  41   0   89  80 |\n| 1  80  89   0   41 |\n| 1  89  80   41   0 |\n\nCompute the determinant of this matrix.\n\nLet me denote the matrix as CM.\n\nI can expand the determinant along the first row.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n0 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor).\n\nBut since the first element is 0, that term drops out.\n\nSo, determinant = -1 * det(M1) + 1 * det(M2) - 1 * det(M3) + 1 * det(M4),\n\nwhere M1 is the minor for element (0,1), M2 for (0,2), etc.\n\nEach minor is a 4x4 matrix.\n\nBut computing 4x4 determinants four times sounds time-consuming, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's some symmetry that allows the determinant to be computed more easily.\n\nLooking at the matrix, I notice that rows 2,3,4,5 are permutations of each other in some way.\n\nWait, actually, rows 2,3,4,5 are all similar, each has 1, followed by a permutation of 41,80,89,0, etc.\n\nWait, maybe subtracting rows from each other can create zeros.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps perform row operations to simplify.\n\nLet me try subtracting row 2 from row 3, row 2 from row 4, and row 2 from row 5.\n\nWait, no, because all rows except the first are similar.\n\nWait, let's denote the rows as R0, R1, R2, R3, R4.\n\nCompute R2 = R2 - R1, R3 = R3 - R1, R4 = R4 - R1.\n\nSo, the new matrix after row operations will be:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 0, 41, -41, 49, -8\n\nRow 3: 0, 80, 49, -80, -49\n\nRow 4: 0, 89, -49, -49, -89\n\nWait, let me compute each minor.\n\nWait, actually, the minors M1, M2, M3, M4 are the 4x4 matrices obtained by removing row 0 and column j for j=1,2,3,4,5.\n\nBut since computing this is getting too involved, perhaps I can use the fact that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid and use a different formula for the volume.\n\nWait, I found a resource that says for a disphenoid, the volume is V = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / (8*sqrt(2)).\n\nBut let me check if this formula is applicable.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles, which is not necessarily the case here. Wait, in our case, the opposite edges are equal, but the faces are congruent in pairs.\n\nWait, actually, in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent, but in our case, it's a rhombic disphenoid, where the opposite edges are equal, and the faces are congruent in pairs. So, perhaps the formula still applies.\n\nLet me try using this formula.\n\nSo, let me denote a, b, c as the lengths of the edges from one vertex.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, the formula is for a tetrahedron with three edges emanating from one vertex, say a, b, c, and the opposite edges are equal: a = a', b = b', c = c'. Then, the formula for the volume is V = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / (8*sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, in our case, the edges from a vertex are AB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89). The opposite edges are CD = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), BC = sqrt(89). So, it fits the disphenoid condition where opposite edges are equal.\n\nSo, let me apply the formula.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 = 41 + 80 - 89 = 32.\n\nSecond term: a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 41 + 89 - 80 = 50.\n\nThird term: b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2 = 80 + 89 - 41 = 128.\n\nSo, the product is 32 * 50 * 128.\n\nCompute that:\n\n32 * 50 = 1600.\n\n1600 * 128 = 204,800.\n\nSo, V = sqrt(204800) / (8*sqrt(2)).\n\nCompute sqrt(204800):\n\n204800 = 2048 * 100 = 1024 * 2 * 100 = 1024 * 200.\n\nsqrt(1024 * 200) = 32 * sqrt(200) = 32 * 10 * sqrt(2) = 320 sqrt(2).\n\nSo, sqrt(204800) = 320 sqrt(2).\n\nThus, V = (320 sqrt(2)) / (8 sqrt(2)) ) = 320 / 8 = 40.\n\nSo, the volume V is 40.\n\nWait, that seems clean. So, V=40.\n\nNow, moving on to find the inradius r = 3V / S, where S is the total surface area.\n\nSo, I need to compute S, the sum of the areas of the four faces.\n\nEach face is a triangle. Let's compute the area of each face.\n\nFaces are ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD.\n\nCompute area of ABC:\n\nSides AB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), BC = sqrt(89).\n\nUse Heron's formula.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.\n\nBut this might get messy. Alternatively, use another formula, like 1/2 ab sin(theta), but I don't know the angles.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the area using the Cayley-Menger determinant for each face.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the edge lengths, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, but given that all faces are congruent in pairs, maybe the areas come in pairs.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid, the four faces come in two congruent pairs. So, in our case, maybe two faces have area X, and the other two have area Y.\n\nBut let's check.\n\nCompute area of triangle ABC:\n\nSides AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80).\n\nUsing Heron's formula:\n\ns = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.\n\nArea = sqrt( s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC) ).\n\nBut this will be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for area based on edge lengths and the volume.\n\nWait, another approach: The area of a triangle can be computed using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nWhich is similar to Heron's formula.\n\nSo, for triangle ABC:\n\na = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nCompute:\n\n(a + b + c) = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89).\n\n(-a + b + c) = -sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89).\n\n(a - b + c) = sqrt(41) - sqrt(80) + sqrt(89).\n\n(a + b - c) = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) - sqrt(89).\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe instead, compute the area using vectors.\n\nWait, perhaps if I can find the area of one face, the other faces may have the same area due to symmetry.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid, opposite faces are congruent, so ABC and ADC should have the same area, and ABD and BCD should have the same area.\n\nSo, maybe compute area of ABC and area of ABD, then double each.\n\nLet's compute area of ABC:\n\nUsing Heron's formula.\n\nCompute s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.\n\nBut computing this will be messy. Alternatively, perhaps compute using vectors.\n\nWait, since we have coordinates for points A, B, C, perhaps we can compute the area using the cross product.\n\nWait, point A is (0,0,0), B is (sqrt(41),0,0), C is (16 sqrt(41)/41, sqrt(3024/41), 0).\n\nSo, vectors AB and AC are:\n\nAB = (sqrt(41), 0, 0).\n\nAC = (16 sqrt(41)/41, sqrt(3024/41), 0).\n\nThe cross product AB \u00d7 AC is (0, 0, (sqrt(41)*sqrt(3024/41) - 0*(16 sqrt(41)/41))) = (0,0, sqrt(3024)).\n\nSo, the magnitude of the cross product is sqrt(3024).\n\nThus, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*sqrt(3024).\n\nCompute sqrt(3024): 3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 *7.\n\nSo, sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21).\n\nThus, area ABC = (1/2)*12 sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21).\n\nSimilarly, the area of triangle ADC is the same as ABC, so also 6 sqrt(21).\n\nNow, compute area of triangle ABD.\n\nPoints A(0,0,0), B(sqrt(41),0,0), D(25 sqrt(41)/41, s, t).\n\nVectors AB = (sqrt(41), 0, 0).\n\nAD = (25 sqrt(41)/41, s, t).\n\nThe cross product AB \u00d7 AD is (0* t - 0 * s, 0*25 sqrt(41)/41 - sqrt(41)*t, sqrt(41)*s - 0*25 sqrt(41)/41 )\n\n= (0, -sqrt(41) t, sqrt(41) s).\n\nThe magnitude squared is (0)^2 + ( -sqrt(41) t )^2 + ( sqrt(41) s )^2 = 41 t\u00b2 + 41 s\u00b2 = 41 (s\u00b2 + t\u00b2) = 41*(3024/41)=3024.\n\nSo, the magnitude is sqrt(3024)=12 sqrt(21).\n\nThus, area ABD = (1/2)*12 sqrt(21)=6 sqrt(21).\n\nWait, that's the same as ABC.\n\nWait, that can't be, because in a disphenoid, opposite faces are congruent, so ABC and ADC are congruent, and ABD and BCD are congruent. So, if ABC and ABD have the same area, that would mean all faces are congruent, which would make it a regular tetrahedron, but in our case, the edge lengths are different.\n\nWait, that suggests I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Because in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent? Or is that only in a regular tetrahedron.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent in pairs, not necessarily all four.\n\nWait, in our case, ABC and ADC have the same area, as do ABD and BCD. So, if I computed ABC and ABD both as 6 sqrt(21), that would imply all four faces are congruent, which would make it a regular tetrahedron, which it's not.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ABD.\n\nWait, in the cross product for ABD, the vectors are AB and AD.\n\nAB is (sqrt(41), 0, 0).\n\nAD is (25 sqrt(41)/41, s, t).\n\nSo, cross product AB \u00d7 AD is:\n\n|i    j      k|\n|sqrt(41) 0    0|\n|25 sqrt(41)/41  s  t|\n\n= i*(0*t - 0*s) - j*(sqrt(41)*t - 0*(25 sqrt(41)/41)) + k*(sqrt(41)*s - 0*(25 sqrt(41)/41)).\n\nSo, that's (0, -sqrt(41) t, sqrt(41) s).\n\nThe magnitude is sqrt( (0)^2 + (sqrt(41) t)^2 + (sqrt(41) s)^2 ) = sqrt(41 (s\u00b2 + t\u00b2)) = sqrt(41*(3024/41))=sqrt(3024)=12 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, area ABD is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21)=6 sqrt(21). So, same as ABC.\n\nHmm, that's odd. So, all four faces have the same area? That would mean the tetrahedron is regular, which it's not, because the edge lengths are different.\n\nWait, but wait, no, in a regular tetrahedron, all edges are equal, but here, edges are AB=CD=sqrt(41), AC=BD=sqrt(80), BC=AD=sqrt(89). So, all edges are paired but not equal.\n\nSo, perhaps the areas of the faces are all the same, which would make it a disphenoid with congruent faces.\n\nWait, but if all four faces have the same area, that's possible without the tetrahedron being regular. So, maybe it is a disphenoid with congruent faces.\n\nSo, if all four faces have area 6 sqrt(21), then the total surface area S is 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21).\n\nBut wait, let's check the area of another face, say BCD.\n\nPoints B, C, D.\n\nCompute vectors CB and CD.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to use the cross product again.\n\nPoint B is at (sqrt(41), 0, 0).\n\nPoint C is at (16 sqrt(41)/41, sqrt(3024/41), 0).\n\nPoint D is at (25 sqrt(41)/41, s, t).\n\nSo, vectors CB = B - C = (sqrt(41) - 16 sqrt(41)/41, 0 - sqrt(3024/41), 0 - 0) = ( (41 sqrt(41) -16 sqrt(41))/41, -sqrt(3024/41), 0 ) = (25 sqrt(41)/41, -sqrt(3024/41), 0).\n\nVector CD = D - C = (25 sqrt(41)/41 -16 sqrt(41)/41, s - sqrt(3024/41), t - 0) = (9 sqrt(41)/41, s - sqrt(3024/41), t).\n\nSo, cross product CB \u00d7 CD is:\n\n|i                     j                     k|\n|25 sqrt(41)/41    -sqrt(3024/41)         0|\n|9 sqrt(41)/41   s - sqrt(3024/41)      t|\n\n= i [ (-sqrt(3024/41)*t - 0*(s - sqrt(3024/41)) ) ] - j [ (25 sqrt(41)/41 * t - 0 *9 sqrt(41)/41 ) ] + k [ (25 sqrt(41)/41*(s - sqrt(3024/41)) - (-sqrt(3024/41))*9 sqrt(41)/41 ) ]\n\nSimplify each component:\n\ni component: -sqrt(3024/41)*t\n\nj component: - (25 sqrt(41)/41 * t )\n\nk component: [25 sqrt(41)/41*(s - sqrt(3024/41)) + 9 sqrt(3024/41)*sqrt(41)/41 ]\n\n= [25 sqrt(41)/41 * s - 25 sqrt(41)*sqrt(3024/41)/41 + 9 sqrt(3024*41)/41\u00b2 ]\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe instead, compute the magnitude squared.\n\nBut perhaps instead, use the area formula for triangle BCD.\n\nWait, since it's a disphenoid, maybe the area is the same as the others.\n\nBut since all faces have the same area, as per the cross product calculations, maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, but then the inradius would be r = 3V / S = 3*40 / (24 sqrt(21)) )= 120 / (24 sqrt(21))=5 / sqrt(21)=5 sqrt(21)/21.\n\nSo, r=5 sqrt(21)/21.\n\nThus, m=5, n=21, p=21.\n\nBut wait, m and p must be coprime. 5 and 21 are coprime. n=21, which is 3*7, not divisible by the square of any prime. So, that's acceptable.\n\nThus, m + n + p=5 +21 +21=47.\n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me make sure that all four faces have the same area.\n\nEarlier, for ABC, ABD, and presumably BCD and ACD, the area was 6 sqrt(21). So, total surface area is 4 *6 sqrt(21)=24 sqrt(21). So, S=24 sqrt(21).\n\nThen, r=3V/S=3*40/(24 sqrt(21))=120/(24 sqrt(21))=5/(sqrt(21))=5 sqrt(21)/21.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have used the Cayley-Menger determinant to compute the volume and then the surface area.\n\nBut given that I arrived at a clean answer, and the steps seem consistent, I think this is correct.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given as AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the faces are all equal. I need to find this distance, which is expressed in the form m\u221an / p, and then find m + n + p.\n\nHmm, first, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is called the inradius.\n\nSo, the key here is to find the inradius of this tetrahedron. To do that, I think I need the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area. Because the formula for the inradius r is 3 times the volume V divided by the total surface area S, right? So, r = 3V / S.\n\nBut wait, I'm not 100% sure about that formula. Let me think. In a triangle, the inradius is area divided by semiperimeter. For a tetrahedron, it's similar but in three dimensions. The formula is indeed r = 3V / S, where S is the total surface area. So, I need to find V and S.\n\nFirst, let's compute the volume V. To compute the volume of a tetrahedron, I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant. Since all the edges are given, this might be the way to go.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is:\n\nV = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the matrix:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   a\u00b2  b\u00b2  c\u00b2 |\n| 1  a\u00b2   0   d\u00b2  e\u00b2 |\n| 1  b\u00b2  d\u00b2   0   f\u00b2 |\n| 1  c\u00b2  e\u00b2  f\u00b2   0  |\n\nSo, let me assign the given lengths to a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\nWait, let's make sure which edges correspond to which lengths. The problem says:\n\nAB = CD = sqrt(41), so AB = sqrt(41), CD = sqrt(41).\n\nAC = BD = sqrt(80), so AC = sqrt(80), BD = sqrt(80).\n\nBC = AD = sqrt(89), so BC = sqrt(89), AD = sqrt(89).\n\nBut in the Cayley-Menger determinant, the edges are AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD.\n\nSo:\n\na = AB = sqrt(41)\n\nb = AC = sqrt(80)\n\nc = AD = sqrt(89)\n\nd = BC = sqrt(89)\n\ne = BD = sqrt(80)\n\nf = CD = sqrt(41)\n\nSo, let me square all these to plug into the determinant:\n\na\u00b2 = 41\n\nb\u00b2 = 80\n\nc\u00b2 = 89\n\nd\u00b2 = 89\n\ne\u00b2 = 80\n\nf\u00b2 = 41\n\nNow, the Cayley-Menger matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the Cayley-Menger determinant, the matrix is 5x5, with the first row and column being 0,1,1,1,1 and the first element is 0. The other rows and columns are the squares of the edge lengths.\n\nSo, positions:\n\nCM[0][0] = 0\n\nCM[0][1] = CM[0][2] = CM[0][3] = CM[0][4] = 1\n\nCM[1][0] = 1\n\nCM[1][1] = 0\n\nCM[1][2] = a\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 = 41\n\nCM[1][3] = AC\u00b2 = b\u00b2 = 80\n\nCM[1][4] = AD\u00b2 = c\u00b2 = 89\n\nSimilarly,\n\nCM[2][0] = 1\n\nCM[2][1] = AB\u00b2 = 41\n\nCM[2][2] = 0\n\nCM[2][3] = BC\u00b2 = d\u00b2 = 89\n\nCM[2][4] = BD\u00b2 = e\u00b2 = 80\n\nCM[3][0] = 1\n\nCM[3][1] = AC\u00b2 = 80\n\nCM[3][2] = BC\u00b2 = 89\n\nCM[3][3] = 0\n\nCM[3][4] = CD\u00b2 = f\u00b2 = 41\n\nCM[4][0] = 1\n\nCM[4][1] = AD\u00b2 = 89\n\nCM[4][2] = BD\u00b2 = 80\n\nCM[4][3] = CD\u00b2 = 41\n\nCM[4][4] = 0\n\nSo, the matrix is correct as I wrote above.\n\nNow, the determinant of this matrix will give me 288 * V\u00b2, so V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ).\n\nI need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. That sounds daunting, but maybe there's some symmetry or pattern that can help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way, but I'm not sure. Let's try expanding the determinant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the determinant using some properties or by noticing that the matrix is symmetric.\n\nWait, perhaps the matrix has some symmetry because the edge lengths are arranged in a symmetric way. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the matrix:\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, each row after the first is a permutation of the others. Let me see:\n\nRow 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]\n\nRow 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80] which is row1 shifted?\n\nWait, no, not exactly. Wait, row2 is 1, then 41, 0, 89, 80.\n\nRow3 is 1, 80, 89, 0, 41.\n\nRow4 is 1, 89, 80, 41, 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps if I swap columns, I can make the matrix more symmetric.\n\nBut maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the determinant using some row or column operations to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that the tetrahedron is isohedral or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the tetrahedron is regular? No, because all edges are not equal. AB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a kind of symmetric tetrahedron, called a disphenoid, where opposite edges are equal.\n\nYes, exactly. In a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal. So in this case, AB = CD, AC = BD, AD = BC. So, this is a disphenoid.\n\nSo, maybe the volume formula for a disphenoid is simpler.\n\nWait, I recall that for a disphenoid, the volume can be computed using the formula:\n\nV = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / 72\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, that might be for a different kind of tetrahedron.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to compute the volume.\n\nLet me try that. Let me assign coordinates to the vertices.\n\nLet me put point A at (0, 0, 0).\n\nLet me put point B at (x, 0, 0).\n\nPoint C at (p, q, 0).\n\nPoint D at (r, s, t).\n\nNow, I need to assign coordinates such that all the given edge lengths are satisfied.\n\nBut this might get complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nSo, AB = sqrt(41). Since A is at (0,0,0) and B is at (x,0,0), the distance AB is |x - 0| = |x| = sqrt(41). So, x = sqrt(41). Let's set B at (sqrt(41), 0, 0).\n\nNow, AC = sqrt(80). Point C is at (p, q, 0). So, the distance AC is sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = sqrt(80). So, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 80.\n\nSimilarly, AD = sqrt(89). Point D is at (r, s, t). So, distance AD is sqrt(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2) = sqrt(89), so r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 = 89.\n\nNow, BC = sqrt(89). Point B is at (sqrt(41), 0, 0), point C is at (p, q, 0). So, distance BC is sqrt( (p - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + q\u00b2 ) = sqrt(89). So, (p - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 89.\n\nBut from AC, we have p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 80. So, subtracting these equations:\n\n(p - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 89 - 80 => (p\u00b2 - 2 p sqrt(41) + 41) + q\u00b2 - p\u00b2 - q\u00b2 = 9 => -2 p sqrt(41) + 41 = 9 => -2 p sqrt(41) = -32 => p = (32)/(2 sqrt(41)) = 16 / sqrt(41) = (16 sqrt(41))/41.\n\nSo, p = (16 sqrt(41))/41.\n\nNow, from AC: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 80.\n\nCompute p\u00b2:\n\n(16 sqrt(41)/41)^2 = (256 * 41) / (41^2) ) = (256 / 41).\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 256 / 41.\n\nThen q\u00b2 = 80 - 256 / 41 = (80 * 41 - 256) / 41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024 / 41.\n\nSo, q = sqrt(3024 / 41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41). Let's see what 3024 is. 3024 divided by 16 is 189. 189 is 9*21, which is 9*3*7. So, sqrt(3024) = sqrt(16 * 189) = 4 sqrt(189) = 4 sqrt(9*21) = 4*3 sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21). So, q = 12 sqrt(21) / sqrt(41). Rationalizing, q = 12 sqrt(861) / 41? Wait, no, sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) is sqrt(861)/41? Wait, no, sqrt(a)/sqrt(b) = sqrt(ab)/b. So, sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) = sqrt(21*41)/41. 21*41 is 861. So, q = 12 sqrt(861) / 41.\n\nWait, but that seems complicated. Maybe I can leave it as sqrt(3024/41) for now.\n\nSo, point C is at (16 sqrt(41)/41, sqrt(3024/41), 0).\n\nNow, moving on to point D at (r, s, t). We have AD = sqrt(89), so r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 = 89.\n\nAlso, BD = sqrt(80). Point B is at (sqrt(41), 0, 0). So, distance BD is sqrt( (r - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 ) = sqrt(80). So, (r - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 = 80.\n\nBut we also know that AD is sqrt(89), so r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 = 89. Subtracting these two equations:\n\n(r - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 - (r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2) = 80 - 89 => (r\u00b2 - 2 r sqrt(41) + 41) + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 - r\u00b2 - s\u00b2 - t\u00b2 = -9 => -2 r sqrt(41) + 41 = -9 => -2 r sqrt(41) = -50 => r = 50 / (2 sqrt(41)) = 25 / sqrt(41) = (25 sqrt(41)) / 41.\n\nSo, r = 25 sqrt(41) / 41.\n\nNow, from AD: r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 = 89. Compute r\u00b2:\n\n(25 sqrt(41)/41)^2 = (625 * 41) / (41^2) ) = 625 / 41.\n\nSo, r\u00b2 = 625 / 41.\n\nThen, s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 = 89 - 625 / 41 = (89 * 41 - 625) / 41 = (3649 - 625)/41 = 3024 / 41.\n\nSo, s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 = 3024 / 41.\n\nNow, what else do we know about point D?\n\nWe know CD = sqrt(41). Point C is at (16 sqrt(41)/41, sqrt(3024/41), 0). Point D is at (25 sqrt(41)/41, s, t). So, the distance CD is sqrt( (25 sqrt(41)/41 - 16 sqrt(41)/41)^2 + (s - sqrt(3024/41))^2 + (t - 0)^2 ) = sqrt(41).\n\nCompute the x-coordinate difference: (25 sqrt(41) - 16 sqrt(41))/41 = (9 sqrt(41))/41. So, squared: (81 * 41) / (41^2) = 81 / 41.\n\nSo, distance CD squared is 81/41 + (s - sqrt(3024/41))^2 + t^2 = 41.\n\nSo, 81/41 + (s - sqrt(3024/41))^2 + t^2 = 41.\n\nMultiply both sides by 41:\n\n81 + 41*(s - sqrt(3024/41))^2 + 41 t^2 = 41*41 = 1681.\n\nBut we know from earlier that s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 = 3024 / 41. So, 41*(s\u00b2 + t\u00b2) = 3024.\n\nSo, let's expand (s - sqrt(3024/41))^2:\n\n= s\u00b2 - 2 s sqrt(3024/41) + 3024/41.\n\nMultiply by 41:\n\n41 s\u00b2 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) + 3024.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n81 + [41 s\u00b2 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) + 3024] + 41 t^2 = 1681.\n\nBut 41 s\u00b2 + 41 t^2 = 41*(s\u00b2 + t\u00b2) = 3024.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n81 + 3024 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) + 3024 = 1681.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me re-examine that.\n\nWait, I had:\n\n81 + [41 s\u00b2 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) + 3024] + 41 t^2 = 1681.\n\nBut 41 s\u00b2 + 41 t^2 = 3024.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n81 + (3024) - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) + 3024 = 1681.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 81 + 3024 + 3024 is 6129, which is way larger than 1681.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nWe have:\n\nDistance CD squared is 41.\n\nSo, 81/41 + (s - sqrt(3024/41))\u00b2 + t\u00b2 = 41.\n\nMultiply both sides by 41:\n\n81 + 41*(s - sqrt(3024/41))\u00b2 + 41 t\u00b2 = 1681.\n\nNow, expand (s - sqrt(3024/41))\u00b2:\n\n= s\u00b2 - 2 s sqrt(3024/41) + 3024/41.\n\nMultiply by 41:\n\n41 s\u00b2 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) + 3024.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n81 + 41 s\u00b2 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) + 3024 + 41 t\u00b2 = 1681.\n\nBut 41 s\u00b2 + 41 t\u00b2 = 41*(s\u00b2 + t\u00b2) = 41*(3024/41) = 3024.\n\nSo, substitute:\n\n81 + 3024 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) + 3024 = 1681.\n\nSo, 81 + 3024 + 3024 = 6129.\n\nSo, 6129 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) = 1681.\n\nThen, 6129 - 1681 = 2 s sqrt(3024*41).\n\nCompute 6129 - 1681: 6129 - 1600 = 4529, minus 81 more: 4529 -81=4448.\n\nSo, 4448 = 2 s sqrt(3024*41).\n\nDivide both sides by 2: 2224 = s sqrt(3024*41).\n\nSo, s = 2224 / sqrt(3024 *41).\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024*41).\n\nFactor 3024: 3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7. So, sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, sqrt(3024 * 41) = sqrt(3024) * sqrt(41) = 12 sqrt(21) * sqrt(41) = 12 sqrt(861).\n\nSo, s = 2224 / (12 sqrt(861)).\n\nSimplify 2224 / 12: 2224 \u00f7 4 = 556, 12 \u00f7 4 = 3. So, 556 / 3.\n\nSo, s = (556 / 3) / sqrt(861) = (556 / 3) / sqrt(861).\n\nRationalizing the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(861):\n\ns = (556 sqrt(861)) / (3 * 861).\n\nSimplify 861: 861 \u00f7 3 = 287. So, 3*861 = 2583.\n\nSo, s = (556 sqrt(861)) / 2583.\n\nSimplify 556 and 2583: Let's see if they have common factors. 2583 \u00f7 556 is about 4.64, so 556 is 4*139. 2583 \u00f7 139: 139*18=2502, 2583-2502=81, so no. So, perhaps 556 and 2583 have a common factor of something else? 556 is 4*139. 2583 \u00f7 139: 139*18=2502, 2583-2502=81. 81 \u00f7 139 is not an integer. So, no common factors. So, s = 556 sqrt(861) / 2583.\n\nWait, but this seems messy. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, from the equation:\n\n81 + 41*(s - sqrt(3024/41))\u00b2 + 41 t\u00b2 = 1681.\n\nBut 41*(s - sqrt(3024/41))\u00b2 + 41 t\u00b2 = 1681 -81=1600.\n\nBut 41*(s\u00b2 - 2 s sqrt(3024/41) + 3024/41) +41 t\u00b2 =1600.\n\nWhich is 41 s\u00b2 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) + 3024 +41 t\u00b2 =1600.\n\nBut 41 s\u00b2 +41 t\u00b2=3024.\n\nSo, substitute:\n\n3024 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) + 3024 =1600.\n\nWait, that would be 6048 - 2 s sqrt(3024*41) =1600.\n\nSo, 6048 -1600=2 s sqrt(3024*41).\n\nSo, 4448=2 s sqrt(3024*41).\n\nThus, s=4448/(2 sqrt(3024*41))=2224/sqrt(3024*41).\n\nWhich is what I had before.\n\nSo, s=2224/sqrt(3024*41)=2224/(12 sqrt(861))=556/(3 sqrt(861)).\n\nSo, s=556 sqrt(861)/(3*861)=556 sqrt(861)/2583.\n\nSo, s= (556/2583) sqrt(861).\n\nHmm, 556 and 2583: 556 \u00f7 4=139, 2583 \u00f7 4=645.75, not integer. So, that's as simplified as it gets.\n\nNow, knowing that s\u00b2 + t\u00b2=3024/41, we can find t.\n\ns = (556 sqrt(861))/2583.\n\nCompute s\u00b2:\n\n(556^2 *861)/ (2583^2).\n\nBut 2583=3*861, so 2583=3*861.\n\nSo, s\u00b2=(556^2 *861)/(9 *861\u00b2)=556\u00b2/(9*861).\n\nSo, s\u00b2= (556\u00b2)/(9*861).\n\nThen, t\u00b2=3024/41 - s\u00b2.\n\nBut 3024/41 is approximately 73.756.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute t in terms of s.\n\nBut this is getting very messy. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of assigning coordinates, I can compute the volume another way.\n\nWait, since it's a disphenoid, maybe the volume can be calculated using the formula for a disphenoid.\n\nI recall that in a disphenoid, the volume is given by V = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / 72.\n\nWait, is that correct? Or is it a different formula.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's V = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / (something). Let me check.\n\nWait, I think the formula for the volume of a disphenoid is V = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / (8 * sqrt(2)).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is V = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / 72.\n\nWait, let me see if I can find the formula.\n\nUpon a quick check in my mind, I think for a disphenoid, which has four congruent faces, the volume can be computed using the formula involving the squares of the edges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant as I initially thought, even though it's a 5x5 determinant.\n\nSo, let's try that.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   41  80  89 |\n| 1  41   0   89  80 |\n| 1  80  89   0   41 |\n| 1  89  80   41   0 |\n\nCompute the determinant of this matrix.\n\nLet me denote the matrix as CM.\n\nI can expand the determinant along the first row.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n0 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor).\n\nBut since the first element is 0, that term drops out.\n\nSo, determinant = -1 * det(M1) + 1 * det(M2) - 1 * det(M3) + 1 * det(M4),\n\nwhere M1 is the minor for element (0,1), M2 for (0,2), etc.\n\nEach minor is a 4x4 matrix.\n\nBut computing 4x4 determinants four times sounds time-consuming, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's some symmetry that allows the determinant to be computed more easily.\n\nLooking at the matrix, I notice that rows 2,3,4,5 are permutations of each other in some way.\n\nWait, actually, rows 2,3,4,5 are all similar, each has 1, followed by a permutation of 41,80,89,0, etc.\n\nWait, maybe subtracting rows from each other can create zeros.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps perform row operations to simplify.\n\nLet me try subtracting row 2 from row 3, row 2 from row 4, and row 2 from row 5.\n\nWait, no, because all rows except the first are similar.\n\nWait, let's denote the rows as R0, R1, R2, R3, R4.\n\nCompute R2 = R2 - R1, R3 = R3 - R1, R4 = R4 - R1.\n\nSo, the new matrix after row operations will be:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 0, 41, -41, 49, -8\n\nRow 3: 0, 80, 49, -80, -49\n\nRow 4: 0, 89, -49, -49, -89\n\nWait, let me compute each minor.\n\nWait, actually, the minors M1, M2, M3, M4 are the 4x4 matrices obtained by removing row 0 and column j for j=1,2,3,4,5.\n\nBut since computing this is getting too involved, perhaps I can use the fact that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid and use a different formula for the volume.\n\nWait, I found a resource that says for a disphenoid, the volume is V = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / (8*sqrt(2)).\n\nBut let me check if this formula is applicable.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles, which is not necessarily the case here. Wait, in our case, the opposite edges are equal, but the faces are congruent in pairs.\n\nWait, actually, in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent, but in our case, it's a rhombic disphenoid, where the opposite edges are equal, and the faces are congruent in pairs. So, perhaps the formula still applies.\n\nLet me try using this formula.\n\nSo, let me denote a, b, c as the lengths of the edges from one vertex.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, the formula is for a tetrahedron with three edges emanating from one vertex, say a, b, c, and the opposite edges are equal: a = a', b = b', c = c'. Then, the formula for the volume is V = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / (8*sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, in our case, the edges from a vertex are AB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89). The opposite edges are CD = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), BC = sqrt(89). So, it fits the disphenoid condition where opposite edges are equal.\n\nSo, let me apply the formula.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 = 41 + 80 - 89 = 32.\n\nSecond term: a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 41 + 89 - 80 = 50.\n\nThird term: b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2 = 80 + 89 - 41 = 128.\n\nSo, the product is 32 * 50 * 128.\n\nCompute that:\n\n32 * 50 = 1600.\n\n1600 * 128 = 204,800.\n\nSo, V = sqrt(204800) / (8*sqrt(2)).\n\nCompute sqrt(204800):\n\n204800 = 2048 * 100 = 1024 * 2 * 100 = 1024 * 200.\n\nsqrt(1024 * 200) = 32 * sqrt(200) = 32 * 10 * sqrt(2) = 320 sqrt(2).\n\nSo, sqrt(204800) = 320 sqrt(2).\n\nThus, V = (320 sqrt(2)) / (8 sqrt(2)) ) = 320 / 8 = 40.\n\nSo, the volume V is 40.\n\nWait, that seems clean. So, V=40.\n\nNow, moving on to find the inradius r = 3V / S, where S is the total surface area.\n\nSo, I need to compute S, the sum of the areas of the four faces.\n\nEach face is a triangle. Let's compute the area of each face.\n\nFaces are ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD.\n\nCompute area of ABC:\n\nSides AB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), BC = sqrt(89).\n\nUse Heron's formula.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.\n\nBut this might get messy. Alternatively, use another formula, like 1/2 ab sin(theta), but I don't know the angles.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the area using the Cayley-Menger determinant for each face.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the edge lengths, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, but given that all faces are congruent in pairs, maybe the areas come in pairs.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid, the four faces come in two congruent pairs. So, in our case, maybe two faces have area X, and the other two have area Y.\n\nBut let's check.\n\nCompute area of triangle ABC:\n\nSides AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80).\n\nUsing Heron's formula:\n\ns = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.\n\nArea = sqrt( s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC) ).\n\nBut this will be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for area based on edge lengths and the volume.\n\nWait, another approach: The area of a triangle can be computed using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nWhich is similar to Heron's formula.\n\nSo, for triangle ABC:\n\na = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nCompute:\n\n(a + b + c) = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89).\n\n(-a + b + c) = -sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89).\n\n(a - b + c) = sqrt(41) - sqrt(80) + sqrt(89).\n\n(a + b - c) = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) - sqrt(89).\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe instead, compute the area using vectors.\n\nWait, perhaps if I can find the area of one face, the other faces may have the same area due to symmetry.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid, opposite faces are congruent, so ABC and ADC should have the same area, and ABD and BCD should have the same area.\n\nSo, maybe compute area of ABC and area of ABD, then double each.\n\nLet's compute area of ABC:\n\nUsing Heron's formula.\n\nCompute s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.\n\nBut computing this will be messy. Alternatively, perhaps compute using vectors.\n\nWait, since we have coordinates for points A, B, C, perhaps we can compute the area using the cross product.\n\nWait, point A is (0,0,0), B is (sqrt(41),0,0), C is (16 sqrt(41)/41, sqrt(3024/41), 0).\n\nSo, vectors AB and AC are:\n\nAB = (sqrt(41), 0, 0).\n\nAC = (16 sqrt(41)/41, sqrt(3024/41), 0).\n\nThe cross product AB \u00d7 AC is (0, 0, (sqrt(41)*sqrt(3024/41) - 0*(16 sqrt(41)/41))) = (0,0, sqrt(3024)).\n\nSo, the magnitude of the cross product is sqrt(3024).\n\nThus, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*sqrt(3024).\n\nCompute sqrt(3024): 3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 *7.\n\nSo, sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21).\n\nThus, area ABC = (1/2)*12 sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21).\n\nSimilarly, the area of triangle ADC is the same as ABC, so also 6 sqrt(21).\n\nNow, compute area of triangle ABD.\n\nPoints A(0,0,0), B(sqrt(41),0,0), D(25 sqrt(41)/41, s, t).\n\nVectors AB = (sqrt(41), 0, 0).\n\nAD = (25 sqrt(41)/41, s, t).\n\nThe cross product AB \u00d7 AD is (0* t - 0 * s, 0*25 sqrt(41)/41 - sqrt(41)*t, sqrt(41)*s - 0*25 sqrt(41)/41 )\n\n= (0, -sqrt(41) t, sqrt(41) s).\n\nThe magnitude squared is (0)^2 + ( -sqrt(41) t )^2 + ( sqrt(41) s )^2 = 41 t\u00b2 + 41 s\u00b2 = 41 (s\u00b2 + t\u00b2) = 41*(3024/41)=3024.\n\nSo, the magnitude is sqrt(3024)=12 sqrt(21).\n\nThus, area ABD = (1/2)*12 sqrt(21)=6 sqrt(21).\n\nWait, that's the same as ABC.\n\nWait, that can't be, because in a disphenoid, opposite faces are congruent, so ABC and ADC are congruent, and ABD and BCD are congruent. So, if ABC and ABD have the same area, that would mean all faces are congruent, which would make it a regular tetrahedron, but in our case, the edge lengths are different.\n\nWait, that suggests I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Because in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent? Or is that only in a regular tetrahedron.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent in pairs, not necessarily all four.\n\nWait, in our case, ABC and ADC have the same area, as do ABD and BCD. So, if I computed ABC and ABD both as 6 sqrt(21), that would imply all four faces are congruent, which would make it a regular tetrahedron, which it's not.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ABD.\n\nWait, in the cross product for ABD, the vectors are AB and AD.\n\nAB is (sqrt(41), 0, 0).\n\nAD is (25 sqrt(41)/41, s, t).\n\nSo, cross product AB \u00d7 AD is:\n\n|i    j      k|\n|sqrt(41) 0    0|\n|25 sqrt(41)/41  s  t|\n\n= i*(0*t - 0*s) - j*(sqrt(41)*t - 0*(25 sqrt(41)/41)) + k*(sqrt(41)*s - 0*(25 sqrt(41)/41)).\n\nSo, that's (0, -sqrt(41) t, sqrt(41) s).\n\nThe magnitude is sqrt( (0)^2 + (sqrt(41) t)^2 + (sqrt(41) s)^2 ) = sqrt(41 (s\u00b2 + t\u00b2)) = sqrt(41*(3024/41))=sqrt(3024)=12 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, area ABD is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21)=6 sqrt(21). So, same as ABC.\n\nHmm, that's odd. So, all four faces have the same area? That would mean the tetrahedron is regular, which it's not, because the edge lengths are different.\n\nWait, but wait, no, in a regular tetrahedron, all edges are equal, but here, edges are AB=CD=sqrt(41), AC=BD=sqrt(80), BC=AD=sqrt(89). So, all edges are paired but not equal.\n\nSo, perhaps the areas of the faces are all the same, which would make it a disphenoid with congruent faces.\n\nWait, but if all four faces have the same area, that's possible without the tetrahedron being regular. So, maybe it is a disphenoid with congruent faces.\n\nSo, if all four faces have area 6 sqrt(21), then the total surface area S is 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21).\n\nBut wait, let's check the area of another face, say BCD.\n\nPoints B, C, D.\n\nCompute vectors CB and CD.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to use the cross product again.\n\nPoint B is at (sqrt(41), 0, 0).\n\nPoint C is at (16 sqrt(41)/41, sqrt(3024/41), 0).\n\nPoint D is at (25 sqrt(41)/41, s, t).\n\nSo, vectors CB = B - C = (sqrt(41) - 16 sqrt(41)/41, 0 - sqrt(3024/41), 0 - 0) = ( (41 sqrt(41) -16 sqrt(41))/41, -sqrt(3024/41), 0 ) = (25 sqrt(41)/41, -sqrt(3024/41), 0).\n\nVector CD = D - C = (25 sqrt(41)/41 -16 sqrt(41)/41, s - sqrt(3024/41), t - 0) = (9 sqrt(41)/41, s - sqrt(3024/41), t).\n\nSo, cross product CB \u00d7 CD is:\n\n|i                     j                     k|\n|25 sqrt(41)/41    -sqrt(3024/41)         0|\n|9 sqrt(41)/41   s - sqrt(3024/41)      t|\n\n= i [ (-sqrt(3024/41)*t - 0*(s - sqrt(3024/41)) ) ] - j [ (25 sqrt(41)/41 * t - 0 *9 sqrt(41)/41 ) ] + k [ (25 sqrt(41)/41*(s - sqrt(3024/41)) - (-sqrt(3024/41))*9 sqrt(41)/41 ) ]\n\nSimplify each component:\n\ni component: -sqrt(3024/41)*t\n\nj component: - (25 sqrt(41)/41 * t )\n\nk component: [25 sqrt(41)/41*(s - sqrt(3024/41)) + 9 sqrt(3024/41)*sqrt(41)/41 ]\n\n= [25 sqrt(41)/41 * s - 25 sqrt(41)*sqrt(3024/41)/41 + 9 sqrt(3024*41)/41\u00b2 ]\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe instead, compute the magnitude squared.\n\nBut perhaps instead, use the area formula for triangle BCD.\n\nWait, since it's a disphenoid, maybe the area is the same as the others.\n\nBut since all faces have the same area, as per the cross product calculations, maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, but then the inradius would be r = 3V / S = 3*40 / (24 sqrt(21)) )= 120 / (24 sqrt(21))=5 / sqrt(21)=5 sqrt(21)/21.\n\nSo, r=5 sqrt(21)/21.\n\nThus, m=5, n=21, p=21.\n\nBut wait, m and p must be coprime. 5 and 21 are coprime. n=21, which is 3*7, not divisible by the square of any prime. So, that's acceptable.\n\nThus, m + n + p=5 +21 +21=47.\n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me make sure that all four faces have the same area.\n\nEarlier, for ABC, ABD, and presumably BCD and ACD, the area was 6 sqrt(21). So, total surface area is 4 *6 sqrt(21)=24 sqrt(21). So, S=24 sqrt(21).\n\nThen, r=3V/S=3*40/(24 sqrt(21))=120/(24 sqrt(21))=5/(sqrt(21))=5 sqrt(21)/21.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have used the Cayley-Menger determinant to compute the volume and then the surface area.\n\nBut given that I arrived at a clean answer, and the steps seem consistent, I think this is correct.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we recognize that the tetrahedron \\(ABCD\\) is a disphenoid with opposite edges equal: \\(AB = CD = \\sqrt{41}\\), \\(AC = BD = \\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(BC = AD = \\sqrt{89}\\). The inradius \\(r\\) of a tetrahedron is given by \\(r = \\frac{3V}{S}\\), where \\(V\\) is the volume and \\(S\\) is the total surface area.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Volume\nUsing the formula for the volume of a disphenoid:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{\\sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)}}{8\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(a^2 = 41\\), \\(b^2 = 80\\), and \\(c^2 = 89\\):\n\\[\nV = \\frac{\\sqrt{(41 + 80 - 89)(41 + 89 - 80)(80 + 89 - 41)}}{8\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{32 \\cdot 50 \\cdot 128}}{8\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{204800}}{8\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{320\\sqrt{2}}{8\\sqrt{2}} = 40\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Surface Area\nEach face of the tetrahedron is a triangle with sides \\(\\sqrt{41}\\), \\(\\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{89}\\). Using Heron's formula, the area of one face is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{(a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)}\n\\]\nFor one face:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{41} + \\sqrt{80} + \\sqrt{89})(-\\sqrt{41} + \\sqrt{80} + \\sqrt{89})(\\sqrt{41} - \\sqrt{80} + \\sqrt{89})(\\sqrt{41} + \\sqrt{80} - \\sqrt{89})}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to \\(6\\sqrt{21}\\). Since all four faces are congruent:\n\\[\nS = 4 \\times 6\\sqrt{21} = 24\\sqrt{21}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Inradius\n\\[\nr = \\frac{3V}{S} = \\frac{3 \\times 40}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{120}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{21}}{21}\n\\]\nThus, \\(m = 5\\), \\(n = 21\\), and \\(p = 21\\). Therefore, \\(m + n + p = 5 + 21 + 21 = 47\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{47}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both \u221a41, AC and BD are both \u221a80, and BC and AD are both \u221a89. There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. I need to find this distance, which can be written as m\u221an / p, and then compute m + n + p.\n\nHmm, tetrahedrons can be tricky, especially when all the distances from a point to the faces are equal. I remember that such a point is called the incenter, similar to the incenter in a triangle. The incenter is the center of the inscribed sphere, which is tangent to each face. So, the distance we're looking for is the radius of the inscribed sphere, or the inradius.\n\nTo find the inradius, I think the formula is related to the volume and the surface area. For a tetrahedron, the formula is r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So, I need to compute the volume V and the surface area S of this tetrahedron.\n\nBut before that, I should probably figure out if this tetrahedron has any special properties. The edges are given in pairs: AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. That suggests that the tetrahedron is \"equifacial\" or maybe \"isohedral,\" but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, equifacial would mean all faces are congruent, but here the edges are just paired. Maybe it's a \"kite tetrahedron\"? Or perhaps it's a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, making it a kind of \"edge-transitive\" shape.\n\nWait, actually, I think this is called a \"biscribed tetrahedron\" or maybe \"edge-isohedral,\" but I'm not certain. Regardless, the key point is that opposite edges are equal. So, AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. This might imply that the tetrahedron is symmetric in some way, which could help in calculating its volume and surface area.\n\nBut maybe I can model this tetrahedron in 3D coordinates. If I can assign coordinates to the vertices A, B, C, D such that the distances between them match the given edge lengths, then I can compute the volume and surface area from there.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates. Let's place point A at the origin, (0,0,0). Then, let me place point B along the x-axis, so B is at (x, 0, 0). Point C can be in the xy-plane, so its coordinates would be (a, b, 0). Point D will be somewhere in 3D space, say (c, d, e).\n\nBut given the symmetry, perhaps there's a better coordinate system. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the tetrahedron as two triangles in dual positions.\n\nWait, another approach: since opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron is such that each pair of opposite edges are equal and perpendicular? Wait, no, that might not necessarily be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system where each pair of opposite edges are along the coordinate axes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the tetrahedron as formed by two congruent triangles connected in some way.\n\nWait, perhaps using vectors would be helpful. Let me consider vectors for the edges. Let me denote vectors AB, AC, AD as vectors from point A. Then, since AB and CD are equal, that suggests some symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, since AB=CD, AC=BD, and BC=AD, perhaps the tetrahedron is a \"mirror symmetric\" tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. Maybe it's a kind of \"isohedral\" tetrahedron.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to compute the volume using the formula for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal. Is there a formula for the volume in such cases?\n\nI remember that for a tetrahedron with all pairs of opposite edges equal, the volume can be calculated using the formula V = (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) )) / 72, but I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, no, that formula seems more like the formula for the area of a triangle. Maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant, which is a formula that gives the volume of a tetrahedron in terms of its edge lengths.\n\nYes, Cayley-Menger determinant might be the way to go here. The formula is:\n\nVolume^2 = (1/288) * determinant of the following matrix:\n\n0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 AB\u00b2 AC\u00b2 AD\u00b2\n1 AB\u00b2 0 BC\u00b2 BD\u00b2\n1 AC\u00b2 BC\u00b2 0 CD\u00b2\n1 AD\u00b2 BD\u00b2 CD\u00b2 0\n\nSo, plugging in the given edge lengths:\n\nAB = \u221a41, so AB\u00b2 = 41\nAC = \u221a80, so AC\u00b2 = 80\nAD = \u221a89, so AD\u00b2 = 89\nBC = \u221a89, so BC\u00b2 = 89\nBD = \u221a80, so BD\u00b2 = 80\nCD = \u221a41, so CD\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo the matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, let me double-check the positions:\n\nThe matrix is 5x5, with the first row and column being [0,1,1,1,1] and [0,1,1,1,1] respectively.\n\nSo the matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 1 1 1\nRow 1: 1 0 AB\u00b2 AC\u00b2 AD\u00b2\nRow 2: 1 AB\u00b2 0 BC\u00b2 BD\u00b2\nRow 3: 1 AC\u00b2 BC\u00b2 0 CD\u00b2\nRow 4: 1 AD\u00b2 BD\u00b2 CD\u00b2 0\n\nSo plugging in the values:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nNow, I need to compute the determinant of this matrix.\n\nCalculating a 5x5 determinant manually is going to be a bit tedious, but perhaps I can find some symmetry or pattern to simplify it.\n\nLet me denote the matrix as CM. The determinant is det(CM). Then, Volume squared is (1/288) * det(CM).\n\nSo, let's compute det(CM):\n\nCM = [\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n[1, 0, 41, 80, 89],\n[1, 41, 0, 89, 80],\n[1, 80, 89, 0, 41],\n[1, 89, 80, 41, 0]\n]\n\nHmm, maybe I can perform row operations to simplify the determinant.\n\nFirst, note that the first row is [0,1,1,1,1]. Let's subtract the first row from the other rows. Wait, but rows 1 to 4 have 1 as the first element. Alternatively, maybe subtract row 1 from rows 2,3,4.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to expand along the first row.\n\nThe determinant can be expanded along the first row:\n\ndet(CM) = 0 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor)\n\nBut since the first element is 0, that term drops out.\n\nSo, det(CM) = -1 * det(M1) + 1 * det(M2) - 1 * det(M3) + 1 * det(M4), where M1, M2, M3, M4 are the minors corresponding to the elements in the first row.\n\nWait, but this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or symmetry that can be exploited.\n\nLooking at the matrix, rows 1, 2, 3, 4 are symmetric in a way. For example, row 2 is [1,41,0,89,80], row 3 is [1,80,89,0,41], row 4 is [1,89,80,41,0]. It seems like each row is a cyclic permutation of the previous one, but not exactly. Let me see:\n\nRow 1: [1,0,41,80,89]\nRow 2: [1,41,0,89,80]\nRow 3: [1,80,89,0,41]\nRow 4: [1,89,80,41,0]\n\nSo, each row after the first is a rotation of the previous, shifting the elements to the right. So, the matrix has a kind of rotational symmetry.\n\nThis suggests that the determinant might have some properties that can be exploited, perhaps leading to a simplified calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the determinant using the fact that the matrix is persymmetric (symmetric about the secondary diagonal), but I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that the determinant is the same as the determinant of its transpose. So, maybe I can transpose the matrix to see if it's easier, but I don't think that will help.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: if all the face areas are equal, then the inradius can be found by 3V divided by the total surface area. But in this case, the faces might not all be equal, but the edge lengths are symmetric, so maybe the areas are equal.\n\nWait, let me check: each face is a triangle with sides of certain lengths. Let's see:\n\nFaces are ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD.\n\nCompute the area of each face.\n\nFor face ABC: edges AB=\u221a41, BC=\u221a89, AC=\u221a80.\n\nSo, sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nCompute the area using Heron's formula.\n\nSimilarly, for face ABD: edges AB=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89.\n\nSame as ABC.\n\nFor face ACD: edges AC=\u221a80, CD=\u221a41, AD=\u221a89.\n\nSame as ABC.\n\nFor face BCD: edges BC=\u221a89, CD=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80.\n\nSame as ABC.\n\nWait a minute, all four faces have the same side lengths, so all four faces are congruent triangles. That means each face has the same area. So, if I can compute the area of one face, I can multiply by four to get the total surface area.\n\nSo, let's compute the area of triangle ABC.\n\nSides: a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nBut let's compute s:\n\ns = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2.\n\nBut Heron's formula is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]. That might get messy, but maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since all sides are known, perhaps we can compute the area using vectors or coordinates.\n\nWait, but maybe using the formula for the area in terms of edge lengths and the Cayley-Menger determinant for the triangle.\n\nWait, for a triangle, the area squared is given by (1/16) times the determinant of a certain matrix. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nSo, plugging in a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89:\n\nCompute each term:\n\na + b + c = \u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89\n\n-a + b + c = -\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89\n\na - b + c = \u221a41 - \u221a80 + \u221a89\n\na + b - c = \u221a41 + \u221a80 - \u221a89\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can compute the squares to see if things simplify.\n\nCompute (a + b + c)^2 = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)^2 = 41 + 80 + 89 + 2\u221a(41*80) + 2\u221a(41*89) + 2\u221a(80*89)\n\nWhich is 210 + 2\u221a3280 + 2\u221a3649 + 2\u221a7120\n\nBut that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the product (-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c):\n\nLet me denote x = (-a + b + c), y = (a - b + c), z = (a + b - c)\n\nThen, xyz = (-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the area using vectors by assigning coordinates to the triangle.\n\nLet me place point A at (0, 0, 0), point B at (x, 0, 0), and point C at (p, q, 0). Then, compute the distances AB, AC, BC.\n\nGiven AB = \u221a41, so AB\u00b2 = x\u00b2 = 41, so x = \u221a41.\n\nAC = \u221a80, so AC\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 80.\n\nBC = \u221a89, so BC\u00b2 = (p - x)^2 + q\u00b2 = 89.\n\nSo, expanding BC\u00b2:\n\n(p - \u221a41)^2 + q\u00b2 = 89\n\n=> p\u00b2 - 2p\u221a41 + 41 + q\u00b2 = 89\n\nBut p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 80, so substitute:\n\n80 - 2p\u221a41 + 41 = 89\n\n=> 121 - 2p\u221a41 = 89\n\n=> -2p\u221a41 = -32\n\n=> 2p\u221a41 = 32\n\n=> p = 32 / (2\u221a41) = 16 / \u221a41\n\nRationalizing the denominator: p = (16\u221a41)/41\n\nNow, since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 80:\n\n( (16\u221a41)/41 )\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 80\n\nCompute (256 * 41) / (41\u00b2) + q\u00b2 = 80\n\n256/41 + q\u00b2 = 80\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = 80 - 256/41 = (80*41 - 256)/41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024 / 41\n\nThus, q = sqrt(3024 / 41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7\n\nSo sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12\u221a21\n\nSo q = 12\u221a21 / \u221a41 = (12\u221a21 * \u221a41) / 41 = 12\u221a(861) / 41\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as (12\u221a21)/\u221a41.\n\nBut regardless, the area of triangle ABC can be found using the cross product of vectors AB and AC.\n\nVector AB is (\u221a41, 0, 0)\n\nVector AC is (16\u221a41/41, 12\u221a21/\u221a41, 0)\n\nThe cross product AB \u00d7 AC is determinant:\n\ni  j          k\n\u221a41 0          0\n16\u221a41/41 12\u221a21/\u221a41 0\n\nWhich is i*(0*0 - 0*(12\u221a21/\u221a41)) - j*(\u221a41*0 - 0*(16\u221a41/41)) + k*(\u221a41*(12\u221a21/\u221a41) - 0*(16\u221a41/41))\n\nSimplify:\n\ni*0 - j*0 + k*(12\u221a21)\n\nSo, the cross product vector is (0, 0, 12\u221a21)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is 12\u221a21, so the area is half of that: 6\u221a21.\n\nWait, that's nice! So the area of triangle ABC is 6\u221a21.\n\nSince all four faces are congruent, each has area 6\u221a21. Therefore, the total surface area S = 4 * 6\u221a21 = 24\u221a21.\n\nNow, moving on to the volume. I need to compute the volume V of the tetrahedron. Since I have the edge lengths, perhaps I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant as I initially thought.\n\nSo, let me try computing the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n| 0 1 1 1 1 |\n| 1 0 41 80 89 |\n| 1 41 0 89 80 |\n| 1 80 89 0 41 |\n| 1 89 80 41 0 |\n\nComputing this determinant is going to be a bit involved, but perhaps I can find some pattern or symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can exploit the fact that the volume is non-zero and perhaps the determinant is a perfect square or something manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can subtract rows to simplify.\n\nLet me denote the determinant as D.\n\nCompute D = determinant of the above 5x5 matrix.\n\nI can perform row operations to simplify it.\n\nFirst, subtract row 1 from rows 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nBut wait, row 1 is [0,1,1,1,1], and rows 2,3,4,5 start with 1.\n\nWait, if I subtract row 1 from row 2, the first element becomes 1-0=1, but the other elements:\n\nRow2_new = Row2 - Row1:\n\n1-0=1, 41-1=40, 0-1=-1, 89-1=88, 80-1=79\n\nSimilarly, Row3_new = Row3 - Row1:\n\n1-0=1, 80-1=79, 89-1=88, 0-1=-1, 41-1=40\n\nRow4_new = Row4 - Row1:\n\n1-0=1, 89-1=88, 80-1=79, 41-1=40, 0-1=-1\n\nRow5_new = Row5 - Row1:\n\n1-0=1, 89-1=88, 80-1=79, 41-1=40, 0-1=-1\n\nWait, but looking at this, rows 2,3,4,5 after subtraction become:\n\nRow2: [1,40,-1,88,79]\n\nRow3: [1,79,88,-1,40]\n\nRow4: [1,88,79,40,-1]\n\nRow5: [1,88,79,40,-1]\n\nWait, actually, rows 4 and 5 after subtraction are identical. That might help.\n\nWait, let me write out the new matrix after subtracting row1 from rows 2,3,4,5:\n\nRow0: 0 1 1 1 1\n\nRow1: 1 0 41 80 89\n\nRow2: 1 40 -1 88 79\n\nRow3: 1 79 88 -1 40\n\nRow4: 1 88 79 40 -1\n\nRow5: 1 88 79 40 -1\n\nWait, but rows 4 and 5 are identical. That could be useful because if two rows are identical, the determinant is zero. But since we're doing operations on the original matrix, maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction. Let me double-check.\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow1: 1 0 41 80 89\n\nRow2: 1 41 0 89 80\n\nRow3: 1 80 89 0 41\n\nRow4: 1 89 80 41 0\n\nSubtracting row1 from row2: 1-1=0, 41-0=41, 0-41=-41, 89-80=9, 80-89=-9\n\nWait, no, I think I messed up earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, no, wait: when subtracting row1 from row2, it's row2 - row1.\n\nRow2 elements: [1,41,0,89,80]\n\nRow1 elements: [1,0,41,80,89]\n\nSo row2 - row1: 1-1=0, 41-0=41, 0-41=-41, 89-80=9, 80-89=-9\n\nSimilarly, row3 - row1: [1,80,89,0,41] - [1,0,41,80,89] = [0,80,48,-80,-48]\n\nWait, no, 1-1=0, 80-0=80, 89-41=48, 0-80=-80, 41-89=-48\n\nSimilarly, row4 - row1: [1,89,80,41,0] - [1,0,41,80,89] = [0,89,39,-39,-89]\n\nWait, 89-0=89, 80-41=39, 41-80=-39, 0-89=-89\n\nRow5 - row1: [1,89,80,41,0] - [1,0,41,80,89] = same as row4 - row1: [0,89,39,-39,-89]\n\nWait, no, row5 was the same as row4 before subtraction, so row5 - row1 would be the same as row4 - row1.\n\nSo, after subtraction, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow0: 0 1 1 1 1\n\nRow1: 1 0 41 80 89\n\nRow2: 0 41 -41 9 -9\n\nRow3: 0 80 48 -80 -48\n\nRow4: 0 89 39 -39 -89\n\nRow5: 0 89 39 -39 -89\n\nWait, now, looking at this, rows 4 and 5 are identical. So, the determinant of a matrix with two identical rows is zero. But since we're subtracting row1 from row2, row3, row4, row5, which were part of the original matrix, but the determinant changes based on row operations.\n\nWait, no, when we perform row operations, the determinant changes. Subtracting a row from another doesn't change the determinant, but in this case, we're subtracting row1 from rows 2,3,4,5, which can be seen as adding (-row1) to each of those rows. Since adding a multiple of a row doesn't change the determinant, the determinant remains the same. But now, rows 4 and 5 are identical, so the determinant of the new matrix is zero. But that can't be right because the original determinant is non-zero (since the tetrahedron has a volume). So, I must have made a mistake in my row operations.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm confusing the order. The original matrix is 5x5, with rows 0 to 4. Wait, no, in the Cayley-Menger determinant, the matrix is 5x5, with the first row and column being [0,1,1,1,1] and [0,1,1,1,1] respectively. So, rows 1 to 4 correspond to the points A,B,C,D.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the indexing. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the Cayley-Menger matrix for 4 points in 3D space, it's a 5x5 matrix. The first row and first column are [0,1,1,1,1], and the other entries are the squared distances between the points.\n\nSo, in the matrix, rows 1 to 4 correspond to the four points, and row 0 is [0,1,1,1,1]. So, when I subtract row1 from rows 2,3,4, I get rows that have 0 in the first position, but the rest of the elements are adjusted.\n\nBut in doing so, I ended up with rows 4 and 5 (if considering 5 rows) being identical, but in reality, it's rows 4 and 5 in a 5x5 matrix. Wait, no, in a 5x5 matrix, we have rows 0 to 4. So, when I subtract row1 from rows 2,3,4, I get rows 2,3,4 as:\n\nRow2: 0 41 -41 9 -9\n\nRow3: 0 80 48 -80 -48\n\nRow4: 0 89 39 -39 -89\n\nWait, but now, after this operation, the matrix looks like:\n\nRow0: 0 1 1 1 1\n\nRow1: 1 0 41 80 89\n\nRow2: 0 41 -41 9 -9\n\nRow3: 0 80 48 -80 -48\n\nRow4: 0 89 39 -39 -89\n\nNow, looking at this, the determinant is the same as the original. But now, rows 2,3,4 have 0 in the first column, so maybe we can expand the determinant along the first column.\n\nThe determinant can be expanded along the first column, which has elements [0,1,0,0,0].\n\nSo, the determinant D is:\n\n0 * minor(0,0) - 1 * minor(1,0) + 0 * minor(2,0) - 0 * minor(3,0) + 0 * minor(4,0)\n\nWhich simplifies to -1 * minor(1,0), where minor(1,0) is the determinant of the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing row1 and column0.\n\nSo, minor(1,0) is the determinant of the submatrix:\n\nRow0: 1 1 1 1\n\nRow2: 41 -41 9 -9\n\nRow3: 80 48 -80 -48\n\nRow4: 89 39 -39 -89\n\nWait, no, the submatrix after removing row1 and column0 is:\n\nRow0: 1 1 1 1\n\nRow2: 41 -41 9 -9\n\nRow3: 80 48 -80 -48\n\nRow4: 89 39 -39 -89\n\nSo, the minor(1,0) is the determinant of this 4x4 matrix.\n\nSo, now, I need to compute this 4x4 determinant.\n\nLet me denote this submatrix as M:\n\nM = [\n[1, 1, 1, 1],\n[41, -41, 9, -9],\n[80, 48, -80, -48],\n[89, 39, -39, -89]\n]\n\nCompute determinant of M.\n\nThis is still a 4x4 determinant, but perhaps there's some pattern or further row operations can be done.\n\nLet me try to perform row operations to simplify this determinant.\n\nFirst, let's look at the rows:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow1: [41, -41, 9, -9]\n\nRow2: [80, 48, -80, -48]\n\nRow3: [89, 39, -39, -89]\n\nNotice that Row1 can be factored: 41*(1, -1, 9/41, -9/41). Not particularly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor out common terms:\n\nRow1: 41*(-1) from the first two elements, 9 from the third, -9 from the fourth.\n\nBut maybe instead, let's perform row operations to create zeros.\n\nLet me try subtracting Row0 from Row1, Row2, Row3.\n\nCompute Row1' = Row1 - 41*Row0.\n\nWait, no, Row1 has 41 as the first element, while Row0 has 1. So, perhaps subtract 41*Row0 from Row1.\n\nWait, no, more precisely, if I do Row1' = Row1 - 41*Row0, that would eliminate the first element of Row1.\n\nSimilarly for Row2 and Row3.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nRow1' = Row1 - 41*Row0:\n\n41 - 41*1 = 0\n\n-41 - 41*1 = -82\n\n9 - 41*1 = -32\n\n-9 -41*1 = -50\n\nSimilarly, Row2' = Row2 -80*Row0:\n\n80 -80*1=0\n\n48 -80*1= -32\n\n-80 -80*1= -160\n\n-48 -80*1= -128\n\nRow3' = Row3 -89*Row0:\n\n89 -89*1=0\n\n39 -89*1= -50\n\n-39 -89*1= -128\n\n-89 -89*1= -178\n\nSo, the new matrix after these operations is:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow1': [0, -82, -32, -50]\n\nRow2': [0, -32, -160, -128]\n\nRow3': [0, -50, -128, -178]\n\nNow, the determinant remains the same (up to a sign change from row swaps, but we didn't swap rows). Wait, actually, when you perform row operations, adding a multiple of one row to another doesn't change the determinant, but subtracting a multiple does change it. Wait, no, actually, adding a multiple of a row to another doesn't change the determinant. But here, we're subtracting 41*Row0 from Row1, which is equivalent to Row1 = Row1 - 41*Row0, which is an elementary row operation that doesn't change the determinant.\n\nSo, the determinant of M is the same as the determinant of the new matrix.\n\nNow, the matrix looks like:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow1': [0, -82, -32, -50]\n\nRow2': [0, -32, -160, -128]\n\nRow3': [0, -50, -128, -178]\n\nNow, the determinant can be expanded along the first column, which has 1 followed by three zeros. So, the determinant is 1 times the minor of the (0,0) element, which is the determinant of the submatrix:\n\n[\n[-82, -32, -50],\n[-32, -160, -128],\n[-50, -128, -178]\n]\n\nLet me compute this 3x3 determinant.\n\nCompute:\n\n| -82   -32   -50 |\n| -32  -160  -128 |\n| -50  -128  -178 |\n\nI can compute this using the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion.\n\nLet me do cofactor expansion along the first row.\n\n= -82 * det( [ -160, -128 ], [ -128, -178 ] ) \n  - (-32) * det( [ -32, -128 ], [ -50, -178 ] )\n  + (-50) * det( [ -32, -160 ], [ -50, -128 ] )\n\nCompute each minor:\n\nFirst minor: det( [ -160, -128 ], [ -128, -178 ] )\n\n= (-160)(-178) - (-128)(-128)\n= (28480) - (16384)\n= 28480 - 16384 = 12096\n\nSecond minor: det( [ -32, -128 ], [ -50, -178 ] )\n\n= (-32)(-178) - (-128)(-50)\n= 5696 - 6400\n= -704\n\nThird minor: det( [ -32, -160 ], [ -50, -128 ] )\n\n= (-32)(-128) - (-160)(-50)\n= 4096 - 8000\n= -3904\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\n= -82 * 12096 + 32 * (-704) + (-50) * (-3904)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-82 * 12096: Let's compute 82 * 12096.\n\nCompute 80 * 12096 = 967,680\n\nCompute 2 * 12096 = 24,192\n\nTotal: 967,680 + 24,192 = 991,872\n\nSo, -82 * 12096 = -991,872\n\n32 * (-704) = -22,528\n\n-50 * (-3904) = 195,200\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n-991,872 -22,528 + 195,200\n\nFirst, add -991,872 and -22,528:\n\n-991,872 -22,528 = -1,014,400\n\nThen, add 195,200:\n\n-1,014,400 + 195,200 = -819,200\n\nSo, the determinant of the 3x3 matrix is -819,200.\n\nTherefore, the determinant of M is 1 * (-819,200) = -819,200.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, the determinant of the 3x3 minor is -819,200, so the determinant of M is 1 * (-819,200) = -819,200.\n\nBut wait, earlier, I had:\n\ndet(M) = 1 * det(minor) = 1 * (-819,200) = -819,200.\n\nBut the minor was the determinant of the submatrix after row operations, which was -819,200.\n\nSo, the minor(1,0) is -819,200.\n\nBut wait, the determinant D of the original Cayley-Menger matrix is:\n\nD = -1 * minor(1,0) = -1 * (-819,200) = 819,200.\n\nSo, Volume squared is (1/288) * D = (1/288) * 819,200.\n\nCompute that:\n\n819,200 / 288 = ?\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16:\n\n819,200 \u00f716=51,200\n\n288 \u00f716=18\n\nSo, 51,200 / 18 = ?\n\nSimplify further:\n\n51,200 \u00f7 2 =25,600\n\n18 \u00f72=9\n\nSo, 25,600 /9 \u2248 2844.444...\n\nWait, but exact fraction is 25600/9.\n\nSo, Volume squared is 25600/9.\n\nThus, Volume V = sqrt(25600/9) = 160/3.\n\nSo, the volume is 160/3.\n\nNow, earlier, I found the total surface area S = 24\u221a21.\n\nSo, the inradius r = 3V / S.\n\nCompute that:\n\nr = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160 / (24\u221a21) = (160 \u00f7 8) / (24 \u00f78 \u221a21) ) = 20 / (3\u221a21)\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\n20 / (3\u221a21) = (20\u221a21) / (3*21) = (20\u221a21)/63\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n20 and 63 have a common factor of 1, so it's already in simplest form.\n\nSo, r = (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nThus, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nWait, but 21 and 63 have a common factor. Wait, n is supposed to be square-free. 21 is 3*7, which is square-free, so that's fine. m and p should be coprime. 20 and 63: factors of 20 are 2,4,5,10,20; factors of 63 are 3,7,9,21,63. No common factors, so 20 and 63 are coprime.\n\nThus, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nSo, m + n + p = 20 +21 +63=104.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation for the determinant. Because the determinant came out to be 819,200, which is a big number, but when I compute 819,200 / 288, it's 2844.444..., which is 25600/9, and the square root is 160/3. That seems correct.\n\nAnd then, r = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160/(24\u221a21) = 20/(3\u221a21) = (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 20 +21 +63=104.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both \u221a41, AC and BD are both \u221a80, and BC and AD are both \u221a89. There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. I need to find this distance, which can be written as m\u221an / p, and then compute m + n + p.\n\nHmm, tetrahedrons can be tricky, especially when all the distances from a point to the faces are equal. I remember that such a point is called the incenter, similar to the incenter in a triangle. The incenter is the center of the inscribed sphere, which is tangent to each face. So, the distance we're looking for is the radius of the inscribed sphere, or the inradius.\n\nTo find the inradius, I think the formula is related to the volume and the surface area. For a tetrahedron, the formula is r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So, I need to compute the volume V and the surface area S of this tetrahedron.\n\nBut before that, I should probably figure out if this tetrahedron has any special properties. The edges are given in pairs: AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. That suggests that the tetrahedron is \"equifacial\" or maybe \"isohedral,\" but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, equifacial would mean all faces are congruent, but here the edges are just paired. Maybe it's a \"kite tetrahedron\"? Or perhaps it's a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, making it a kind of \"edge-transitive\" shape.\n\nWait, actually, I think this is called a \"biscribed tetrahedron\" or maybe \"edge-isohedral,\" but I'm not certain. Regardless, the key point is that opposite edges are equal. So, AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. This might imply that the tetrahedron is symmetric in some way, which could help in calculating its volume and surface area.\n\nBut maybe I can model this tetrahedron in 3D coordinates. If I can assign coordinates to the vertices A, B, C, D such that the distances between them match the given edge lengths, then I can compute the volume and surface area from there.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates. Let's place point A at the origin, (0,0,0). Then, let me place point B along the x-axis, so B is at (x, 0, 0). Point C can be in the xy-plane, so its coordinates would be (a, b, 0). Point D will be somewhere in 3D space, say (c, d, e).\n\nBut given the symmetry, perhaps there's a better coordinate system. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the tetrahedron as two triangles in dual positions.\n\nWait, another approach: since opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron is such that each pair of opposite edges are equal and perpendicular? Wait, no, that might not necessarily be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system where each pair of opposite edges are along the coordinate axes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the tetrahedron as formed by two congruent triangles connected in some way.\n\nWait, perhaps using vectors would be helpful. Let me consider vectors for the edges. Let me denote vectors AB, AC, AD as vectors from point A. Then, since AB and CD are equal, that suggests some symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, since AB=CD, AC=BD, and BC=AD, perhaps the tetrahedron is a \"mirror symmetric\" tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. Maybe it's a kind of \"isohedral\" tetrahedron.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to compute the volume using the formula for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal. Is there a formula for the volume in such cases?\n\nI remember that for a tetrahedron with all pairs of opposite edges equal, the volume can be calculated using the formula V = (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) )) / 72, but I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, no, that formula seems more like the formula for the area of a triangle. Maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant, which is a formula that gives the volume of a tetrahedron in terms of its edge lengths.\n\nYes, Cayley-Menger determinant might be the way to go here. The formula is:\n\nVolume^2 = (1/288) * determinant of the following matrix:\n\n0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 AB\u00b2 AC\u00b2 AD\u00b2\n1 AB\u00b2 0 BC\u00b2 BD\u00b2\n1 AC\u00b2 BC\u00b2 0 CD\u00b2\n1 AD\u00b2 BD\u00b2 CD\u00b2 0\n\nSo, plugging in the given edge lengths:\n\nAB = \u221a41, so AB\u00b2 = 41\nAC = \u221a80, so AC\u00b2 = 80\nAD = \u221a89, so AD\u00b2 = 89\nBC = \u221a89, so BC\u00b2 = 89\nBD = \u221a80, so BD\u00b2 = 80\nCD = \u221a41, so CD\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo the matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, let me double-check the positions:\n\nThe matrix is 5x5, with the first row and column being [0,1,1,1,1] and [0,1,1,1,1] respectively.\n\nSo the matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 1 1 1\nRow 1: 1 0 AB\u00b2 AC\u00b2 AD\u00b2\nRow 2: 1 AB\u00b2 0 BC\u00b2 BD\u00b2\nRow 3: 1 AC\u00b2 BC\u00b2 0 CD\u00b2\nRow 4: 1 AD\u00b2 BD\u00b2 CD\u00b2 0\n\nSo plugging in the values:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nNow, I need to compute the determinant of this matrix.\n\nCalculating a 5x5 determinant manually is going to be a bit tedious, but perhaps I can find some symmetry or pattern to simplify it.\n\nLet me denote the matrix as CM. The determinant is det(CM). Then, Volume squared is (1/288) * det(CM).\n\nSo, let's compute det(CM):\n\nCM = [\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n[1, 0, 41, 80, 89],\n[1, 41, 0, 89, 80],\n[1, 80, 89, 0, 41],\n[1, 89, 80, 41, 0]\n]\n\nHmm, maybe I can perform row operations to simplify the determinant.\n\nFirst, note that the first row is [0,1,1,1,1]. Let's subtract the first row from the other rows. Wait, but rows 1 to 4 have 1 as the first element. Alternatively, maybe subtract row 1 from rows 2,3,4.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to expand along the first row.\n\nThe determinant can be expanded along the first row:\n\ndet(CM) = 0 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor)\n\nBut since the first element is 0, that term drops out.\n\nSo, det(CM) = -1 * det(M1) + 1 * det(M2) - 1 * det(M3) + 1 * det(M4), where M1, M2, M3, M4 are the minors corresponding to the elements in the first row.\n\nWait, but this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or symmetry that can be exploited.\n\nLooking at the matrix, rows 1, 2, 3, 4 are symmetric in a way. For example, row 2 is [1,41,0,89,80], row 3 is [1,80,89,0,41], row 4 is [1,89,80,41,0]. It seems like each row is a cyclic permutation of the previous one, but not exactly. Let me see:\n\nRow 1: [1,0,41,80,89]\nRow 2: [1,41,0,89,80]\nRow 3: [1,80,89,0,41]\nRow 4: [1,89,80,41,0]\n\nSo, each row after the first is a rotation of the previous, shifting the elements to the right. So, the matrix has a kind of rotational symmetry.\n\nThis suggests that the determinant might have some properties that can be exploited, perhaps leading to a simplified calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the determinant using the fact that the matrix is persymmetric (symmetric about the secondary diagonal), but I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that the determinant is the same as the determinant of its transpose. So, maybe I can transpose the matrix to see if it's easier, but I don't think that will help.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: if all the face areas are equal, then the inradius can be found by 3V divided by the total surface area. But in this case, the faces might not all be equal, but the edge lengths are symmetric, so maybe the areas are equal.\n\nWait, let me check: each face is a triangle with sides of certain lengths. Let's see:\n\nFaces are ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD.\n\nCompute the area of each face.\n\nFor face ABC: edges AB=\u221a41, BC=\u221a89, AC=\u221a80.\n\nSo, sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nCompute the area using Heron's formula.\n\nSimilarly, for face ABD: edges AB=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89.\n\nSame as ABC.\n\nFor face ACD: edges AC=\u221a80, CD=\u221a41, AD=\u221a89.\n\nSame as ABC.\n\nFor face BCD: edges BC=\u221a89, CD=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80.\n\nSame as ABC.\n\nWait a minute, all four faces have the same side lengths, so all four faces are congruent triangles. That means each face has the same area. So, if I can compute the area of one face, I can multiply by four to get the total surface area.\n\nSo, let's compute the area of triangle ABC.\n\nSides: a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nBut let's compute s:\n\ns = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2.\n\nBut Heron's formula is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]. That might get messy, but maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since all sides are known, perhaps we can compute the area using vectors or coordinates.\n\nWait, but maybe using the formula for the area in terms of edge lengths and the Cayley-Menger determinant for the triangle.\n\nWait, for a triangle, the area squared is given by (1/16) times the determinant of a certain matrix. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nSo, plugging in a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89:\n\nCompute each term:\n\na + b + c = \u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89\n\n-a + b + c = -\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89\n\na - b + c = \u221a41 - \u221a80 + \u221a89\n\na + b - c = \u221a41 + \u221a80 - \u221a89\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can compute the squares to see if things simplify.\n\nCompute (a + b + c)^2 = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)^2 = 41 + 80 + 89 + 2\u221a(41*80) + 2\u221a(41*89) + 2\u221a(80*89)\n\nWhich is 210 + 2\u221a3280 + 2\u221a3649 + 2\u221a7120\n\nBut that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the product (-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c):\n\nLet me denote x = (-a + b + c), y = (a - b + c), z = (a + b - c)\n\nThen, xyz = (-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the area using vectors by assigning coordinates to the triangle.\n\nLet me place point A at (0, 0, 0), point B at (x, 0, 0), and point C at (p, q, 0). Then, compute the distances AB, AC, BC.\n\nGiven AB = \u221a41, so AB\u00b2 = x\u00b2 = 41, so x = \u221a41.\n\nAC = \u221a80, so AC\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 80.\n\nBC = \u221a89, so BC\u00b2 = (p - x)^2 + q\u00b2 = 89.\n\nSo, expanding BC\u00b2:\n\n(p - \u221a41)^2 + q\u00b2 = 89\n\n=> p\u00b2 - 2p\u221a41 + 41 + q\u00b2 = 89\n\nBut p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 80, so substitute:\n\n80 - 2p\u221a41 + 41 = 89\n\n=> 121 - 2p\u221a41 = 89\n\n=> -2p\u221a41 = -32\n\n=> 2p\u221a41 = 32\n\n=> p = 32 / (2\u221a41) = 16 / \u221a41\n\nRationalizing the denominator: p = (16\u221a41)/41\n\nNow, since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 80:\n\n( (16\u221a41)/41 )\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 80\n\nCompute (256 * 41) / (41\u00b2) + q\u00b2 = 80\n\n256/41 + q\u00b2 = 80\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = 80 - 256/41 = (80*41 - 256)/41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024 / 41\n\nThus, q = sqrt(3024 / 41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7\n\nSo sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12\u221a21\n\nSo q = 12\u221a21 / \u221a41 = (12\u221a21 * \u221a41) / 41 = 12\u221a(861) / 41\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as (12\u221a21)/\u221a41.\n\nBut regardless, the area of triangle ABC can be found using the cross product of vectors AB and AC.\n\nVector AB is (\u221a41, 0, 0)\n\nVector AC is (16\u221a41/41, 12\u221a21/\u221a41, 0)\n\nThe cross product AB \u00d7 AC is determinant:\n\ni  j          k\n\u221a41 0          0\n16\u221a41/41 12\u221a21/\u221a41 0\n\nWhich is i*(0*0 - 0*(12\u221a21/\u221a41)) - j*(\u221a41*0 - 0*(16\u221a41/41)) + k*(\u221a41*(12\u221a21/\u221a41) - 0*(16\u221a41/41))\n\nSimplify:\n\ni*0 - j*0 + k*(12\u221a21)\n\nSo, the cross product vector is (0, 0, 12\u221a21)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is 12\u221a21, so the area is half of that: 6\u221a21.\n\nWait, that's nice! So the area of triangle ABC is 6\u221a21.\n\nSince all four faces are congruent, each has area 6\u221a21. Therefore, the total surface area S = 4 * 6\u221a21 = 24\u221a21.\n\nNow, moving on to the volume. I need to compute the volume V of the tetrahedron. Since I have the edge lengths, perhaps I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant as I initially thought.\n\nSo, let me try computing the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n| 0 1 1 1 1 |\n| 1 0 41 80 89 |\n| 1 41 0 89 80 |\n| 1 80 89 0 41 |\n| 1 89 80 41 0 |\n\nComputing this determinant is going to be a bit involved, but perhaps I can find some pattern or symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can exploit the fact that the volume is non-zero and perhaps the determinant is a perfect square or something manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can subtract rows to simplify.\n\nLet me denote the determinant as D.\n\nCompute D = determinant of the above 5x5 matrix.\n\nI can perform row operations to simplify it.\n\nFirst, subtract row 1 from rows 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nBut wait, row 1 is [0,1,1,1,1], and rows 2,3,4,5 start with 1.\n\nWait, if I subtract row 1 from row 2, the first element becomes 1-0=1, but the other elements:\n\nRow2_new = Row2 - Row1:\n\n1-0=1, 41-1=40, 0-1=-1, 89-1=88, 80-1=79\n\nSimilarly, Row3_new = Row3 - Row1:\n\n1-0=1, 80-1=79, 89-1=88, 0-1=-1, 41-1=40\n\nRow4_new = Row4 - Row1:\n\n1-0=1, 89-1=88, 80-1=79, 41-1=40, 0-1=-1\n\nRow5_new = Row5 - Row1:\n\n1-0=1, 89-1=88, 80-1=79, 41-1=40, 0-1=-1\n\nWait, but looking at this, rows 2,3,4,5 after subtraction become:\n\nRow2: [1,40,-1,88,79]\n\nRow3: [1,79,88,-1,40]\n\nRow4: [1,88,79,40,-1]\n\nRow5: [1,88,79,40,-1]\n\nWait, actually, rows 4 and 5 after subtraction are identical. That might help.\n\nWait, let me write out the new matrix after subtracting row1 from rows 2,3,4,5:\n\nRow0: 0 1 1 1 1\n\nRow1: 1 0 41 80 89\n\nRow2: 1 40 -1 88 79\n\nRow3: 1 79 88 -1 40\n\nRow4: 1 88 79 40 -1\n\nRow5: 1 88 79 40 -1\n\nWait, but rows 4 and 5 are identical. That could be useful because if two rows are identical, the determinant is zero. But since we're doing operations on the original matrix, maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction. Let me double-check.\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow1: 1 0 41 80 89\n\nRow2: 1 41 0 89 80\n\nRow3: 1 80 89 0 41\n\nRow4: 1 89 80 41 0\n\nSubtracting row1 from row2: 1-1=0, 41-0=41, 0-41=-41, 89-80=9, 80-89=-9\n\nWait, no, I think I messed up earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, no, wait: when subtracting row1 from row2, it's row2 - row1.\n\nRow2 elements: [1,41,0,89,80]\n\nRow1 elements: [1,0,41,80,89]\n\nSo row2 - row1: 1-1=0, 41-0=41, 0-41=-41, 89-80=9, 80-89=-9\n\nSimilarly, row3 - row1: [1,80,89,0,41] - [1,0,41,80,89] = [0,80,48,-80,-48]\n\nWait, no, 1-1=0, 80-0=80, 89-41=48, 0-80=-80, 41-89=-48\n\nSimilarly, row4 - row1: [1,89,80,41,0] - [1,0,41,80,89] = [0,89,39,-39,-89]\n\nWait, 89-0=89, 80-41=39, 41-80=-39, 0-89=-89\n\nRow5 - row1: [1,89,80,41,0] - [1,0,41,80,89] = same as row4 - row1: [0,89,39,-39,-89]\n\nWait, no, row5 was the same as row4 before subtraction, so row5 - row1 would be the same as row4 - row1.\n\nSo, after subtraction, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow0: 0 1 1 1 1\n\nRow1: 1 0 41 80 89\n\nRow2: 0 41 -41 9 -9\n\nRow3: 0 80 48 -80 -48\n\nRow4: 0 89 39 -39 -89\n\nRow5: 0 89 39 -39 -89\n\nWait, now, looking at this, rows 4 and 5 are identical. So, the determinant of a matrix with two identical rows is zero. But since we're subtracting row1 from row2, row3, row4, row5, which were part of the original matrix, but the determinant changes based on row operations.\n\nWait, no, when we perform row operations, the determinant changes. Subtracting a row from another doesn't change the determinant, but in this case, we're subtracting row1 from rows 2,3,4,5, which can be seen as adding (-row1) to each of those rows. Since adding a multiple of a row doesn't change the determinant, the determinant remains the same. But now, rows 4 and 5 are identical, so the determinant of the new matrix is zero. But that can't be right because the original determinant is non-zero (since the tetrahedron has a volume). So, I must have made a mistake in my row operations.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm confusing the order. The original matrix is 5x5, with rows 0 to 4. Wait, no, in the Cayley-Menger determinant, the matrix is 5x5, with the first row and column being [0,1,1,1,1] and [0,1,1,1,1] respectively. So, rows 1 to 4 correspond to the points A,B,C,D.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the indexing. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the Cayley-Menger matrix for 4 points in 3D space, it's a 5x5 matrix. The first row and first column are [0,1,1,1,1], and the other entries are the squared distances between the points.\n\nSo, in the matrix, rows 1 to 4 correspond to the four points, and row 0 is [0,1,1,1,1]. So, when I subtract row1 from rows 2,3,4, I get rows that have 0 in the first position, but the rest of the elements are adjusted.\n\nBut in doing so, I ended up with rows 4 and 5 (if considering 5 rows) being identical, but in reality, it's rows 4 and 5 in a 5x5 matrix. Wait, no, in a 5x5 matrix, we have rows 0 to 4. So, when I subtract row1 from rows 2,3,4, I get rows 2,3,4 as:\n\nRow2: 0 41 -41 9 -9\n\nRow3: 0 80 48 -80 -48\n\nRow4: 0 89 39 -39 -89\n\nWait, but now, after this operation, the matrix looks like:\n\nRow0: 0 1 1 1 1\n\nRow1: 1 0 41 80 89\n\nRow2: 0 41 -41 9 -9\n\nRow3: 0 80 48 -80 -48\n\nRow4: 0 89 39 -39 -89\n\nNow, looking at this, the determinant is the same as the original. But now, rows 2,3,4 have 0 in the first column, so maybe we can expand the determinant along the first column.\n\nThe determinant can be expanded along the first column, which has elements [0,1,0,0,0].\n\nSo, the determinant D is:\n\n0 * minor(0,0) - 1 * minor(1,0) + 0 * minor(2,0) - 0 * minor(3,0) + 0 * minor(4,0)\n\nWhich simplifies to -1 * minor(1,0), where minor(1,0) is the determinant of the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing row1 and column0.\n\nSo, minor(1,0) is the determinant of the submatrix:\n\nRow0: 1 1 1 1\n\nRow2: 41 -41 9 -9\n\nRow3: 80 48 -80 -48\n\nRow4: 89 39 -39 -89\n\nWait, no, the submatrix after removing row1 and column0 is:\n\nRow0: 1 1 1 1\n\nRow2: 41 -41 9 -9\n\nRow3: 80 48 -80 -48\n\nRow4: 89 39 -39 -89\n\nSo, the minor(1,0) is the determinant of this 4x4 matrix.\n\nSo, now, I need to compute this 4x4 determinant.\n\nLet me denote this submatrix as M:\n\nM = [\n[1, 1, 1, 1],\n[41, -41, 9, -9],\n[80, 48, -80, -48],\n[89, 39, -39, -89]\n]\n\nCompute determinant of M.\n\nThis is still a 4x4 determinant, but perhaps there's some pattern or further row operations can be done.\n\nLet me try to perform row operations to simplify this determinant.\n\nFirst, let's look at the rows:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow1: [41, -41, 9, -9]\n\nRow2: [80, 48, -80, -48]\n\nRow3: [89, 39, -39, -89]\n\nNotice that Row1 can be factored: 41*(1, -1, 9/41, -9/41). Not particularly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor out common terms:\n\nRow1: 41*(-1) from the first two elements, 9 from the third, -9 from the fourth.\n\nBut maybe instead, let's perform row operations to create zeros.\n\nLet me try subtracting Row0 from Row1, Row2, Row3.\n\nCompute Row1' = Row1 - 41*Row0.\n\nWait, no, Row1 has 41 as the first element, while Row0 has 1. So, perhaps subtract 41*Row0 from Row1.\n\nWait, no, more precisely, if I do Row1' = Row1 - 41*Row0, that would eliminate the first element of Row1.\n\nSimilarly for Row2 and Row3.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nRow1' = Row1 - 41*Row0:\n\n41 - 41*1 = 0\n\n-41 - 41*1 = -82\n\n9 - 41*1 = -32\n\n-9 -41*1 = -50\n\nSimilarly, Row2' = Row2 -80*Row0:\n\n80 -80*1=0\n\n48 -80*1= -32\n\n-80 -80*1= -160\n\n-48 -80*1= -128\n\nRow3' = Row3 -89*Row0:\n\n89 -89*1=0\n\n39 -89*1= -50\n\n-39 -89*1= -128\n\n-89 -89*1= -178\n\nSo, the new matrix after these operations is:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow1': [0, -82, -32, -50]\n\nRow2': [0, -32, -160, -128]\n\nRow3': [0, -50, -128, -178]\n\nNow, the determinant remains the same (up to a sign change from row swaps, but we didn't swap rows). Wait, actually, when you perform row operations, adding a multiple of one row to another doesn't change the determinant, but subtracting a multiple does change it. Wait, no, actually, adding a multiple of a row to another doesn't change the determinant. But here, we're subtracting 41*Row0 from Row1, which is equivalent to Row1 = Row1 - 41*Row0, which is an elementary row operation that doesn't change the determinant.\n\nSo, the determinant of M is the same as the determinant of the new matrix.\n\nNow, the matrix looks like:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow1': [0, -82, -32, -50]\n\nRow2': [0, -32, -160, -128]\n\nRow3': [0, -50, -128, -178]\n\nNow, the determinant can be expanded along the first column, which has 1 followed by three zeros. So, the determinant is 1 times the minor of the (0,0) element, which is the determinant of the submatrix:\n\n[\n[-82, -32, -50],\n[-32, -160, -128],\n[-50, -128, -178]\n]\n\nLet me compute this 3x3 determinant.\n\nCompute:\n\n| -82   -32   -50 |\n| -32  -160  -128 |\n| -50  -128  -178 |\n\nI can compute this using the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion.\n\nLet me do cofactor expansion along the first row.\n\n= -82 * det( [ -160, -128 ], [ -128, -178 ] ) \n  - (-32) * det( [ -32, -128 ], [ -50, -178 ] )\n  + (-50) * det( [ -32, -160 ], [ -50, -128 ] )\n\nCompute each minor:\n\nFirst minor: det( [ -160, -128 ], [ -128, -178 ] )\n\n= (-160)(-178) - (-128)(-128)\n= (28480) - (16384)\n= 28480 - 16384 = 12096\n\nSecond minor: det( [ -32, -128 ], [ -50, -178 ] )\n\n= (-32)(-178) - (-128)(-50)\n= 5696 - 6400\n= -704\n\nThird minor: det( [ -32, -160 ], [ -50, -128 ] )\n\n= (-32)(-128) - (-160)(-50)\n= 4096 - 8000\n= -3904\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\n= -82 * 12096 + 32 * (-704) + (-50) * (-3904)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-82 * 12096: Let's compute 82 * 12096.\n\nCompute 80 * 12096 = 967,680\n\nCompute 2 * 12096 = 24,192\n\nTotal: 967,680 + 24,192 = 991,872\n\nSo, -82 * 12096 = -991,872\n\n32 * (-704) = -22,528\n\n-50 * (-3904) = 195,200\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n-991,872 -22,528 + 195,200\n\nFirst, add -991,872 and -22,528:\n\n-991,872 -22,528 = -1,014,400\n\nThen, add 195,200:\n\n-1,014,400 + 195,200 = -819,200\n\nSo, the determinant of the 3x3 matrix is -819,200.\n\nTherefore, the determinant of M is 1 * (-819,200) = -819,200.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, the determinant of the 3x3 minor is -819,200, so the determinant of M is 1 * (-819,200) = -819,200.\n\nBut wait, earlier, I had:\n\ndet(M) = 1 * det(minor) = 1 * (-819,200) = -819,200.\n\nBut the minor was the determinant of the submatrix after row operations, which was -819,200.\n\nSo, the minor(1,0) is -819,200.\n\nBut wait, the determinant D of the original Cayley-Menger matrix is:\n\nD = -1 * minor(1,0) = -1 * (-819,200) = 819,200.\n\nSo, Volume squared is (1/288) * D = (1/288) * 819,200.\n\nCompute that:\n\n819,200 / 288 = ?\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16:\n\n819,200 \u00f716=51,200\n\n288 \u00f716=18\n\nSo, 51,200 / 18 = ?\n\nSimplify further:\n\n51,200 \u00f7 2 =25,600\n\n18 \u00f72=9\n\nSo, 25,600 /9 \u2248 2844.444...\n\nWait, but exact fraction is 25600/9.\n\nSo, Volume squared is 25600/9.\n\nThus, Volume V = sqrt(25600/9) = 160/3.\n\nSo, the volume is 160/3.\n\nNow, earlier, I found the total surface area S = 24\u221a21.\n\nSo, the inradius r = 3V / S.\n\nCompute that:\n\nr = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160 / (24\u221a21) = (160 \u00f7 8) / (24 \u00f78 \u221a21) ) = 20 / (3\u221a21)\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\n20 / (3\u221a21) = (20\u221a21) / (3*21) = (20\u221a21)/63\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n20 and 63 have a common factor of 1, so it's already in simplest form.\n\nSo, r = (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nThus, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nWait, but 21 and 63 have a common factor. Wait, n is supposed to be square-free. 21 is 3*7, which is square-free, so that's fine. m and p should be coprime. 20 and 63: factors of 20 are 2,4,5,10,20; factors of 63 are 3,7,9,21,63. No common factors, so 20 and 63 are coprime.\n\nThus, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nSo, m + n + p = 20 +21 +63=104.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation for the determinant. Because the determinant came out to be 819,200, which is a big number, but when I compute 819,200 / 288, it's 2844.444..., which is 25600/9, and the square root is 160/3. That seems correct.\n\nAnd then, r = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160/(24\u221a21) = 20/(3\u221a21) = (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 20 +21 +63=104.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the inradius of a tetrahedron with given edge lengths. The inradius \\( r \\) can be calculated using the formula \\( r = \\frac{3V}{S} \\), where \\( V \\) is the volume and \\( S \\) is the total surface area of the tetrahedron.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Surface Area\nEach face of the tetrahedron is a triangle with sides \\( \\sqrt{41} \\), \\( \\sqrt{80} \\), and \\( \\sqrt{89} \\). Using Heron's formula, the area of one face is calculated as \\( 6\\sqrt{21} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a special point inside it to each of its faces. That special point is called the incenter, I think, similar to the incenter in a triangle which is equidistant from all sides. So in a tetrahedron, the incenter is equidistant from all four faces. The distance we're looking for is called the inradius.\n\nThe given edge lengths are:\n- AB = CD = sqrt(41)\n- AC = BD = sqrt(80)\n- BC = AD = sqrt(89)\n\nHmm, so each pair of opposite edges is equal. That seems symmetrical. Maybe this is a special kind of tetrahedron, perhaps isohedral or something? Or maybe it's a kind of \"equifacial\" tetrahedron, where all faces are congruent? But wait, the edges are in pairs, so maybe not all faces are congruent, but it might still have some symmetry.\n\nI remember that in a tetrahedron, if all opposite edges are equal, it's called a disphenoid. So this is a disphenoid. Disphenoids have some nice properties, like all faces are congruent triangles if it's a regular disphenoid, but in this case, the edges are not all equal, just opposite edges. So maybe it's a general disphenoid.\n\nIn a disphenoid, the inradius can be found using a formula related to the volume and the surface area. Wait, in a general tetrahedron, the inradius r is equal to 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. So, r = 3V / A_total.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n1. Find the volume V of the tetrahedron.\n2. Find the total surface area A_total.\n3. Compute r = 3V / A_total.\n\nBut to find V, I might need coordinates of the vertices. Alternatively, I can use Heron's formula to find the areas of each face and then use some formula for the volume. But I think using coordinates might be more straightforward here, especially since the edge lengths are given symmetrically.\n\nLet me try setting up coordinates for the tetrahedron. Since it's a disphenoid, it can be embedded in 3D space with vertices at (a, b, c), (-a, -b, c), (-a, b, -c), (a, -b, -c). Wait, does that make sense? Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps a better coordinate system would be symmetric about the origin.\n\nWait, another approach is to place the tetrahedron such that the midpoints of the edges are at the origin. But maybe it's easier to place one vertex at the origin and build coordinates accordingly. Hmm, maybe that's more complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I can place the points such that the midpoints of AB and CD are at the origin, and similarly for the other edges. Let me try to think of it as a symmetric tetrahedron.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, but in this case, are they? Let's check.\n\nEach face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Let me compute the lengths:\n\nAB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), BC = sqrt(89). So each face has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So all four faces are congruent triangles. So each face has the same area.\n\nSo that would make things easier because then the total surface area would just be 4 times the area of one face.\n\nSo first, let's compute the area of one face. Let's take triangle ABC with sides AB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), BC = sqrt(89).\n\nUsing Heron's formula, the semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.\n\nBut Heron's formula might be messy here because of the square roots. Alternatively, maybe we can compute the area using vectors or coordinates.\n\nWait, another formula for the area of a triangle when all three sides are known is Heron's formula. So let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2. Let me compute s squared maybe?\n\nWait, but that might not be the easiest path. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the area using the formula sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].\n\nBut that will involve a lot of square roots. Maybe it's better to compute the area numerically, but I think we can find an exact expression.\n\nWait, let me compute s:\n\ns = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2\n\nBut sqrt(41) is approximately 6.403, sqrt(80) is approximately 8.944, sqrt(89) is approximately 9.434.\n\nSo s \u2248 (6.403 + 8.944 + 9.434)/2 \u2248 (24.781)/2 \u2248 12.3905.\n\nThen, s - a \u2248 12.3905 - 6.403 \u2248 5.9875\n\ns - b \u2248 12.3905 - 8.944 \u2248 3.4465\n\ns - c \u2248 12.3905 - 9.434 \u2248 2.9565\n\nThen, area \u2248 sqrt(12.3905 * 5.9875 * 3.4465 * 2.9565). Hmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe I can compute it exactly.\n\nWait, but maybe we can find a better approach. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, perhaps the volume can be calculated using a formula specific to disphenoids.\n\nI recall that for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated if we know the lengths of the edges. Let me see.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid, the volume is given by V = (sqrt[(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)]) / (6*sqrt(2)) ). Wait, not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another formula: The volume of a disphenoid can be expressed as (4/3) times the volume of a regular tetrahedron with the same edge lengths? Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use coordinates. Let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices.\n\nSince the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, it can be embedded such that the coordinates are symmetric. Let me consider the four vertices as (a, b, c), (-a, -b, c), (-a, b, -c), (a, -b, -c). Then, the edges can be calculated using these coordinates.\n\nLet me denote the four points as:\n\nA = (a, b, c)\n\nB = (-a, -b, c)\n\nC = (-a, b, -c)\n\nD = (a, -b, -c)\n\nNow, let's compute the lengths of the edges.\n\nFirst, AB: distance between A and B.\n\nCoordinates: A = (a, b, c), B = (-a, -b, c)\n\nDistance AB: sqrt[(a - (-a))^2 + (b - (-b))^2 + (c - c)^2] = sqrt[(2a)^2 + (2b)^2 + 0] = sqrt(4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)\n\nGiven AB = sqrt(41), so 2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = sqrt(41). Therefore, sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = sqrt(41)/2. So, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nSimilarly, compute AC: distance between A and C.\n\nA = (a, b, c), C = (-a, b, -c)\n\nDistance AC: sqrt[(a - (-a))^2 + (b - b)^2 + (c - (-c))^2] = sqrt[(2a)^2 + 0 + (2c)^2] = sqrt(4a\u00b2 + 4c\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)\n\nGiven AC = sqrt(80), so 2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(80) => sqrt(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(80)/2 = (4*sqrt(5))/2 = 2*sqrt(5). So, a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (2*sqrt(5))\u00b2 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, compute AD: distance between A and D.\n\nA = (a, b, c), D = (a, -b, -c)\n\nDistance AD: sqrt[(a - a)^2 + (b - (-b))^2 + (c - (-c))^2] = sqrt[0 + (2b)^2 + (2c)^2] = sqrt(4b\u00b2 + 4c\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)\n\nGiven AD = sqrt(89), so 2*sqrt(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(89). So sqrt(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(89)/2. Hence, b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo now, we have three equations:\n\n1. a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4\n2. a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20\n3. b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nWe can solve these equations for a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2.\n\nLet's subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4\n\nc\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 20 - 10.25 = 9.75 = 39/4\n\nSo, c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 39/4.\n\nBut from equation 3, we have b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\nc\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 39/4\n\nc\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nWe can add these two equations:\n\n2c\u00b2 = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32\n\nSo c\u00b2 = 16 => c = 4 or c = -4, but since it's a coordinate, the sign doesn't matter for the distance, so c = 4.\n\nThen, from c\u00b2 = 16, plug into equation 2: a\u00b2 + 16 = 20 => a\u00b2 = 4 => a = 2 or -2.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 3: b\u00b2 + 16 = 89/4 = 22.25 => b\u00b2 = 22.25 - 16 = 6.25 => b = 2.5 or -2.5.\n\nSo, a = 2, b = 2.5, c = 4.\n\nSo, the coordinates of the four points are:\n\nA = (2, 2.5, 4)\n\nB = (-2, -2.5, 4)\n\nC = (-2, 2.5, -4)\n\nD = (2, -2.5, -4)\n\nNow, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron.\n\nThe volume of a tetrahedron with vertices at points A, B, C, D can be found using the scalar triple product formula:\n\nV = | (AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD)) | / 6\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, since I have coordinates, I can compute vectors AB, AC, AD and then compute the determinant.\n\nWait, let's compute vectors from point A to B, C, D.\n\nVectors:\n\nAB = B - A = (-2 - 2, -2.5 - 2.5, 4 - 4) = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = C - A = (-2 - 2, 2.5 - 2.5, -4 - 4) = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = D - A = (2 - 2, -2.5 - 2.5, -4 - 4) = (0, -5, -8)\n\nNow, the volume is (1/6) times the absolute value of the scalar triple product of AB, AC, AD.\n\nThe scalar triple product is AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD).\n\nFirst, compute AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nCompute cross product:\n\ni component: (0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) = 0 - 40 = -40\n\nj component: - [ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ] = - [ 32 - 0 ] = -32\n\nk component: (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 = 20\n\nSo AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nNow, compute AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD):\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nDot product with (-40, -32, 20):\n\n(-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320\n\nSo the scalar triple product is 320. The volume is |320| / 6 = 320 / 6 = 160 / 3.\n\nSo V = 160/3.\n\nNow, moving on to the total surface area.\n\nSince all four faces are congruent triangles, as each face has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, compute the area of one face and multiply by 4.\n\nCompute the area of triangle ABC.\n\nWe can use Heron's formula.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2\n\nWait, sqrt(41) is approx 6.4031, sqrt(80) is approx 8.9443, sqrt(89) is approx 9.4336.\n\nSo s \u2248 (6.4031 + 8.9443 + 9.4336)/2 \u2248 (24.780)/2 \u2248 12.390.\n\nBut let's compute it exactly.\n\ns = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.\n\nBut Heron's formula requires computing sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].\n\nBut this seems messy with all the square roots. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, I remember that in a triangle with sides a, b, c, the area can also be found using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt[(a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)]\n\nWhich is another form of Heron's formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the area using vectors.\n\nGiven points A, B, C with coordinates:\n\nA = (2, 2.5, 4)\n\nB = (-2, -2.5, 4)\n\nC = (-2, 2.5, -4)\n\nSo vectors AB and AC can be used to compute the area.\n\nWait, vectors AB and AC are known.\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nThe area of the parallelogram formed by AB and AC is |AB \u00d7 AC|, so the area of the triangle is half that.\n\nCompute AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCross product:\n\ni component: (-5*(-8) - 0*0) = 40 - 0 = 40\n\nj component: - [ (-4*(-8) - 0*(-4) ) ] = - [32 - 0 ] = -32\n\nk component: (-4*0 - (-5)*(-4)) = 0 - 20 = -20\n\nSo AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7\n\nSo sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21)\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle ABC is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21).\n\nSo each face has area 6 sqrt(21). Since there are four faces, total surface area A_total = 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21).\n\nNow, compute the inradius r = 3V / A_total.\n\nWe have V = 160/3, A_total = 24 sqrt(21).\n\nSo,\n\nr = (3 * (160/3)) / (24 sqrt(21)) ) = (160) / (24 sqrt(21)) )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n160 / 24 = (40 / 6) = (20 / 3)\n\nSo,\n\nr = (20 / 3) / sqrt(21) = (20) / (3 sqrt(21))\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):\n\nr = (20 sqrt(21)) / (3 * 21) ) = (20 sqrt(21)) / 63\n\nSimplify:\n\n20 and 63 are both divisible by... 20 is 2^2*5, 63 is 7*3^2, so they have no common factors. So the fraction is 20/63, and sqrt(21) is square-free.\n\nSo, r = (20 sqrt(21)) / 63\n\nWhich can be written as (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nSo, m = 20, n = 21, p = 63.\n\nWait, but 20 and 63 are coprime? 20 factors: 2,2,5; 63: 3,3,7. No common factors, yes.\n\nAnd n = 21, which is 3*7, not divisible by any square of a prime, correct.\n\nSo m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might have made a mistake.\n\nFirst, volume: Using coordinates, I found V = 160/3. That seems correct.\n\nTotal surface area: Each face area is 6 sqrt(21), four faces, so 24 sqrt(21). That seems right.\n\nInradius r = 3V / A_total = (3*(160/3)) / (24 sqrt(21)) = 160 / (24 sqrt(21)) = 20 / (3 sqrt(21)) = (20 sqrt(21)) / 63. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the answer is 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a special point inside it to each of its faces. That special point is called the incenter, I think, similar to the incenter in a triangle which is equidistant from all sides. So in a tetrahedron, the incenter is equidistant from all four faces. The distance we're looking for is called the inradius.\n\nThe given edge lengths are:\n- AB = CD = sqrt(41)\n- AC = BD = sqrt(80)\n- BC = AD = sqrt(89)\n\nHmm, so each pair of opposite edges is equal. That seems symmetrical. Maybe this is a special kind of tetrahedron, perhaps isohedral or something? Or maybe it's a kind of \"equifacial\" tetrahedron, where all faces are congruent? But wait, the edges are in pairs, so maybe not all faces are congruent, but it might still have some symmetry.\n\nI remember that in a tetrahedron, if all opposite edges are equal, it's called a disphenoid. So this is a disphenoid. Disphenoids have some nice properties, like all faces are congruent triangles if it's a regular disphenoid, but in this case, the edges are not all equal, just opposite edges. So maybe it's a general disphenoid.\n\nIn a disphenoid, the inradius can be found using a formula related to the volume and the surface area. Wait, in a general tetrahedron, the inradius r is equal to 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. So, r = 3V / A_total.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n1. Find the volume V of the tetrahedron.\n2. Find the total surface area A_total.\n3. Compute r = 3V / A_total.\n\nBut to find V, I might need coordinates of the vertices. Alternatively, I can use Heron's formula to find the areas of each face and then use some formula for the volume. But I think using coordinates might be more straightforward here, especially since the edge lengths are given symmetrically.\n\nLet me try setting up coordinates for the tetrahedron. Since it's a disphenoid, it can be embedded in 3D space with vertices at (a, b, c), (-a, -b, c), (-a, b, -c), (a, -b, -c). Wait, does that make sense? Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps a better coordinate system would be symmetric about the origin.\n\nWait, another approach is to place the tetrahedron such that the midpoints of the edges are at the origin. But maybe it's easier to place one vertex at the origin and build coordinates accordingly. Hmm, maybe that's more complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I can place the points such that the midpoints of AB and CD are at the origin, and similarly for the other edges. Let me try to think of it as a symmetric tetrahedron.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, but in this case, are they? Let's check.\n\nEach face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Let me compute the lengths:\n\nAB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), BC = sqrt(89). So each face has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So all four faces are congruent triangles. So each face has the same area.\n\nSo that would make things easier because then the total surface area would just be 4 times the area of one face.\n\nSo first, let's compute the area of one face. Let's take triangle ABC with sides AB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), BC = sqrt(89).\n\nUsing Heron's formula, the semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.\n\nBut Heron's formula might be messy here because of the square roots. Alternatively, maybe we can compute the area using vectors or coordinates.\n\nWait, another formula for the area of a triangle when all three sides are known is Heron's formula. So let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2. Let me compute s squared maybe?\n\nWait, but that might not be the easiest path. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the area using the formula sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].\n\nBut that will involve a lot of square roots. Maybe it's better to compute the area numerically, but I think we can find an exact expression.\n\nWait, let me compute s:\n\ns = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2\n\nBut sqrt(41) is approximately 6.403, sqrt(80) is approximately 8.944, sqrt(89) is approximately 9.434.\n\nSo s \u2248 (6.403 + 8.944 + 9.434)/2 \u2248 (24.781)/2 \u2248 12.3905.\n\nThen, s - a \u2248 12.3905 - 6.403 \u2248 5.9875\n\ns - b \u2248 12.3905 - 8.944 \u2248 3.4465\n\ns - c \u2248 12.3905 - 9.434 \u2248 2.9565\n\nThen, area \u2248 sqrt(12.3905 * 5.9875 * 3.4465 * 2.9565). Hmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe I can compute it exactly.\n\nWait, but maybe we can find a better approach. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, perhaps the volume can be calculated using a formula specific to disphenoids.\n\nI recall that for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated if we know the lengths of the edges. Let me see.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid, the volume is given by V = (sqrt[(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)]) / (6*sqrt(2)) ). Wait, not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another formula: The volume of a disphenoid can be expressed as (4/3) times the volume of a regular tetrahedron with the same edge lengths? Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use coordinates. Let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices.\n\nSince the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, it can be embedded such that the coordinates are symmetric. Let me consider the four vertices as (a, b, c), (-a, -b, c), (-a, b, -c), (a, -b, -c). Then, the edges can be calculated using these coordinates.\n\nLet me denote the four points as:\n\nA = (a, b, c)\n\nB = (-a, -b, c)\n\nC = (-a, b, -c)\n\nD = (a, -b, -c)\n\nNow, let's compute the lengths of the edges.\n\nFirst, AB: distance between A and B.\n\nCoordinates: A = (a, b, c), B = (-a, -b, c)\n\nDistance AB: sqrt[(a - (-a))^2 + (b - (-b))^2 + (c - c)^2] = sqrt[(2a)^2 + (2b)^2 + 0] = sqrt(4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)\n\nGiven AB = sqrt(41), so 2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = sqrt(41). Therefore, sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = sqrt(41)/2. So, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nSimilarly, compute AC: distance between A and C.\n\nA = (a, b, c), C = (-a, b, -c)\n\nDistance AC: sqrt[(a - (-a))^2 + (b - b)^2 + (c - (-c))^2] = sqrt[(2a)^2 + 0 + (2c)^2] = sqrt(4a\u00b2 + 4c\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)\n\nGiven AC = sqrt(80), so 2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(80) => sqrt(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(80)/2 = (4*sqrt(5))/2 = 2*sqrt(5). So, a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (2*sqrt(5))\u00b2 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, compute AD: distance between A and D.\n\nA = (a, b, c), D = (a, -b, -c)\n\nDistance AD: sqrt[(a - a)^2 + (b - (-b))^2 + (c - (-c))^2] = sqrt[0 + (2b)^2 + (2c)^2] = sqrt(4b\u00b2 + 4c\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)\n\nGiven AD = sqrt(89), so 2*sqrt(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(89). So sqrt(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(89)/2. Hence, b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo now, we have three equations:\n\n1. a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4\n2. a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20\n3. b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nWe can solve these equations for a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2.\n\nLet's subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4\n\nc\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 20 - 10.25 = 9.75 = 39/4\n\nSo, c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 39/4.\n\nBut from equation 3, we have b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\nc\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 39/4\n\nc\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nWe can add these two equations:\n\n2c\u00b2 = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32\n\nSo c\u00b2 = 16 => c = 4 or c = -4, but since it's a coordinate, the sign doesn't matter for the distance, so c = 4.\n\nThen, from c\u00b2 = 16, plug into equation 2: a\u00b2 + 16 = 20 => a\u00b2 = 4 => a = 2 or -2.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 3: b\u00b2 + 16 = 89/4 = 22.25 => b\u00b2 = 22.25 - 16 = 6.25 => b = 2.5 or -2.5.\n\nSo, a = 2, b = 2.5, c = 4.\n\nSo, the coordinates of the four points are:\n\nA = (2, 2.5, 4)\n\nB = (-2, -2.5, 4)\n\nC = (-2, 2.5, -4)\n\nD = (2, -2.5, -4)\n\nNow, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron.\n\nThe volume of a tetrahedron with vertices at points A, B, C, D can be found using the scalar triple product formula:\n\nV = | (AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD)) | / 6\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, since I have coordinates, I can compute vectors AB, AC, AD and then compute the determinant.\n\nWait, let's compute vectors from point A to B, C, D.\n\nVectors:\n\nAB = B - A = (-2 - 2, -2.5 - 2.5, 4 - 4) = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = C - A = (-2 - 2, 2.5 - 2.5, -4 - 4) = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = D - A = (2 - 2, -2.5 - 2.5, -4 - 4) = (0, -5, -8)\n\nNow, the volume is (1/6) times the absolute value of the scalar triple product of AB, AC, AD.\n\nThe scalar triple product is AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD).\n\nFirst, compute AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nCompute cross product:\n\ni component: (0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) = 0 - 40 = -40\n\nj component: - [ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ] = - [ 32 - 0 ] = -32\n\nk component: (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 = 20\n\nSo AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nNow, compute AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD):\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nDot product with (-40, -32, 20):\n\n(-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320\n\nSo the scalar triple product is 320. The volume is |320| / 6 = 320 / 6 = 160 / 3.\n\nSo V = 160/3.\n\nNow, moving on to the total surface area.\n\nSince all four faces are congruent triangles, as each face has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, compute the area of one face and multiply by 4.\n\nCompute the area of triangle ABC.\n\nWe can use Heron's formula.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2\n\nWait, sqrt(41) is approx 6.4031, sqrt(80) is approx 8.9443, sqrt(89) is approx 9.4336.\n\nSo s \u2248 (6.4031 + 8.9443 + 9.4336)/2 \u2248 (24.780)/2 \u2248 12.390.\n\nBut let's compute it exactly.\n\ns = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.\n\nBut Heron's formula requires computing sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].\n\nBut this seems messy with all the square roots. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, I remember that in a triangle with sides a, b, c, the area can also be found using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt[(a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)]\n\nWhich is another form of Heron's formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the area using vectors.\n\nGiven points A, B, C with coordinates:\n\nA = (2, 2.5, 4)\n\nB = (-2, -2.5, 4)\n\nC = (-2, 2.5, -4)\n\nSo vectors AB and AC can be used to compute the area.\n\nWait, vectors AB and AC are known.\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nThe area of the parallelogram formed by AB and AC is |AB \u00d7 AC|, so the area of the triangle is half that.\n\nCompute AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCross product:\n\ni component: (-5*(-8) - 0*0) = 40 - 0 = 40\n\nj component: - [ (-4*(-8) - 0*(-4) ) ] = - [32 - 0 ] = -32\n\nk component: (-4*0 - (-5)*(-4)) = 0 - 20 = -20\n\nSo AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7\n\nSo sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21)\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle ABC is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21).\n\nSo each face has area 6 sqrt(21). Since there are four faces, total surface area A_total = 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21).\n\nNow, compute the inradius r = 3V / A_total.\n\nWe have V = 160/3, A_total = 24 sqrt(21).\n\nSo,\n\nr = (3 * (160/3)) / (24 sqrt(21)) ) = (160) / (24 sqrt(21)) )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n160 / 24 = (40 / 6) = (20 / 3)\n\nSo,\n\nr = (20 / 3) / sqrt(21) = (20) / (3 sqrt(21))\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):\n\nr = (20 sqrt(21)) / (3 * 21) ) = (20 sqrt(21)) / 63\n\nSimplify:\n\n20 and 63 are both divisible by... 20 is 2^2*5, 63 is 7*3^2, so they have no common factors. So the fraction is 20/63, and sqrt(21) is square-free.\n\nSo, r = (20 sqrt(21)) / 63\n\nWhich can be written as (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nSo, m = 20, n = 21, p = 63.\n\nWait, but 20 and 63 are coprime? 20 factors: 2,2,5; 63: 3,3,7. No common factors, yes.\n\nAnd n = 21, which is 3*7, not divisible by any square of a prime, correct.\n\nSo m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might have made a mistake.\n\nFirst, volume: Using coordinates, I found V = 160/3. That seems correct.\n\nTotal surface area: Each face area is 6 sqrt(21), four faces, so 24 sqrt(21). That seems right.\n\nInradius r = 3V / A_total = (3*(160/3)) / (24 sqrt(21)) = 160 / (24 sqrt(21)) = 20 / (3 sqrt(21)) = (20 sqrt(21)) / 63. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the answer is 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we recognize that the given tetrahedron is a disphenoid with opposite edges equal. We use the properties of disphenoids to determine the inradius, which is the distance from the incenter to each face.\n\n1. **Volume Calculation**:\n   - Assign coordinates to the vertices based on the symmetry of the disphenoid.\n   - Calculate the vectors between points and use the scalar triple product to find the volume.\n   - The volume \\( V \\) is found to be \\( \\frac{160}{3} \\).\n\n2. **Surface Area Calculation**:\n   - Each face of the tetrahedron is a congruent triangle with sides \\( \\sqrt{41} \\), \\( \\sqrt{80} \\), and \\( \\sqrt{89} \\).\n   - Use the cross product of vectors to find the area of one face.\n   - Each face area is \\( 6\\sqrt{21} \\), and the total surface area is \\( 24\\sqrt{21} \\).\n\n3. **Inradius Calculation**:\n   - The inradius \\( r \\) is given by \\( r = \\frac{3V}{A_{\\text{total}}} \\).\n   - Substituting the values, \\( r = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63} \\).\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - Express \\( r \\) in the form \\( \\frac{m\\sqrt{n}}{p} \\) with \\( m = 20 \\), \\( n = 21 \\), and \\( p = 63 \\).\n   - Sum these values to get \\( m + n + p = 104 \\).\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{104}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given with specific lengths: AB and CD are both \u221a41, AC and BD are both \u221a80, and BC and AD are both \u221a89. I need to find the distance from the incenter (a point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer should be in the form m\u221an/p, where m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then I have to find m + n + p.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula: \n\ninradius = 3 * (volume) / (sum of the areas of the four faces)\n\nSo, I need to compute the volume of the tetrahedron and the areas of each face.\n\nBut wait, the tetrahedron has some symmetry because opposite edges are equal. So AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD. That suggests that the tetrahedron is \"isohedral\" or at least has some symmetry which might make calculations easier.\n\nMaybe I can assign coordinates to the vertices to make it easier. Let's try to place the points in a coordinate system.\n\nLet me denote the points as A, B, C, D. Since opposite edges are equal, perhaps this tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system where the coordinates of the points are symmetric in some way.\n\nI recall that for such symmetric tetrahedrons, sometimes you can place them such that the coordinates are symmetric around the origin. For example, perhaps A and C are symmetric with respect to the origin, as are B and D.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to assign coordinates step by step.\n\nLet me try to place point A at (a, b, c), point B at (d, e, f), point C at (-a, -b, -c), and point D at (-d, -e, -f). Then, the opposite edges would have the same lengths because of the symmetry.\n\nWait, let's check: AB would be the distance between A and B, which is \u221a[(d - a)^2 + (e - b)^2 + (f - c)^2]. CD would be the distance between C and D, which is \u221a[(-d + a)^2 + (-e + b)^2 + (-f + c)^2] = \u221a[(a - d)^2 + (b - e)^2 + (c - f)^2] which is the same as AB. So that's good, AB = CD.\n\nSimilarly, AC is the distance between A and C, which is \u221a[(-a - a)^2 + (-b - b)^2 + (-c - c)^2] = \u221a[(-2a)^2 + (-2b)^2 + (-2c)^2] = \u221a[4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2 + 4c\u00b2] = 2\u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2). Similarly, BD is the distance between B and D, which would be \u221a[(-d - d)^2 + (-e - e)^2 + (-f - f)^2] = 2\u221a(d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2). So AC = BD implies that 2\u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 2\u221a(d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2), so a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, BC is the distance between B and C: \u221a[(-a - d)^2 + (-b - e)^2 + (-c - f)^2], and AD is the distance between A and D: \u221a[(-d - a)^2 + (-e - b)^2 + (-f - c)^2]. So BC and AD are the same, which aligns with the problem statement.\n\nSo, this coordinate system seems plausible. Let me try to assign coordinates accordingly.\n\nLet me let A = (a, b, c), B = (d, e, f), C = (-a, -b, -c), D = (-d, -e, -f).\n\nSo, the edges are as given.\n\nGiven that AB = CD = \u221a41, AC = BD = \u221a80, and BC = AD = \u221a89.\n\nSo, AB^2 = (d - a)^2 + (e - b)^2 + (f - c)^2 = 41.\n\nAC^2 = ( -a - a)^2 + (-b - b)^2 + (-c - c)^2 = 4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2 +4c\u00b2 = 80 \u2192 4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 80 \u2192 a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, BD^2 = (-d - d)^2 + (-e - e)^2 + (-f - f)^2 = 4d\u00b2 +4e\u00b2 +4f\u00b2 = 80 \u2192 same as AC, so 4(d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2) =80 \u2192 d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 =20. So, we have a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 =20.\n\nNow, BC is the distance between B and C: \u221a[(-a - d)^2 + (-b - e)^2 + (-c - f)^2]^2 = (a + d)^2 + (b + e)^2 + (c + f)^2 = 89.\n\nAD is the distance between A and D: \u221a[(-d - a)^2 + (-e - b)^2 + (-f - c)^2]^2 = (a + d)^2 + (b + e)^2 + (c + f)^2 =89. So, same as BC.\n\nSo, BC^2 = (a + d)^2 + (b + e)^2 + (c + f)^2 =89.\n\nSimilarly, AB^2 = (d - a)^2 + (e - b)^2 + (f - c)^2 =41.\n\nSo, let me write down:\n\nEquation 1: (d - a)^2 + (e - b)^2 + (f - c)^2 =41.\n\nEquation 2: (a + d)^2 + (b + e)^2 + (c + f)^2 =89.\n\nWe also know that a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =20 and d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2=20.\n\nLet me expand Equation 1 and Equation 2.\n\nEquation 1: (d\u00b2 - 2ad + a\u00b2) + (e\u00b2 - 2be + b\u00b2) + (f\u00b2 - 2cf + c\u00b2) =41.\n\nWhich is (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + (d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2) - 2(ad + be + cf) =41.\n\nWe know a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =20 and d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2=20, so 20 +20 - 2(ad + be + cf)=41.\n\nSo, 40 - 2(ad + be + cf)=41 \u2192 -2(ad + be + cf)=1 \u2192 ad + be + cf= -1/2.\n\nEquation 2: (a + d)^2 + (b + e)^2 + (c + f)^2 =89.\n\nExpanding, a\u00b2 + 2ad + d\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2be + e\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2cf + f\u00b2 =89.\n\nWhich is (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + (d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2) + 2(ad + be + cf)=89.\n\nAgain, 20 +20 + 2(ad + be + cf)=89.\n\nSo, 40 + 2(ad + be + cf)=89 \u2192 2(ad + be + cf)=49 \u2192 ad + be + cf=24.5.\n\nWait, that's a problem. From Equation 1, ad + be + cf = -1/2. From Equation 2, ad + be + cf =49/2=24.5.\n\nBut that's a contradiction. -1/2 \u226024.5. So, something must be wrong.\n\nHmm, perhaps my initial assumption about the coordinates is incorrect. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the tetrahedron isn't symmetric in the way I thought. Maybe I can't assign points A, B, C, D as I did. Maybe I need to choose a different coordinate system.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron is such that all edges are equal in pairs, but not in a symmetric way. Maybe it's better to use vectors or another method.\n\nWait, another approach: since all opposite edges are equal, maybe this tetrahedron is \"equifacial\" or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a disphenoid, which is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal.\n\nYes! I remember that a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, so this must be a disphenoid.\n\nIn a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Wait, actually, in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent in pairs. So, perhaps each pair of opposite faces are congruent.\n\nBut in this problem, the edges are such that AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD, but each of the faces is a triangle with edges from these. So, maybe each face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89, but wait, that can't be because each face is a triangle, so each face must have three edges.\n\nWait, no, each face is a triangle, but each face has edges from the given edges. Let me think: For face ABC, the edges are AB, BC, and AC. So, AB=\u221a41, BC=\u221a89, and AC=\u221a80.\n\nSimilarly, face ABD has edges AB=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89.\n\nSame for other faces. So, each face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89.\n\nWait, so all four faces are congruent triangles. So, each face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. So, the tetrahedron is a regular-faced tetrahedron, meaning all faces are congruent. That's a special case of a disphenoid.\n\nIf all faces are congruent, then the tetrahedron is called isohedral, and perhaps it's easier to compute the volume and the areas.\n\nSo, first, compute the area of each face. Since each face is a triangle with sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nWait, let me compute the area of one face using Heron's formula.\n\nCompute the semi-perimeter: s = (a + b + c)/2 = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2.\n\nBut Heron's formula might get messy with square roots. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for area in terms of sides and the cosine law to find the height.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using vectors or coordinates is a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron if I can find the coordinates of the points. Since all faces are congruent, maybe the tetrahedron is regular, but no, in a regular tetrahedron all edges are equal, which is not the case here.\n\nWait, maybe it's a tetragonal disphenoid, which has four congruent triangular faces and opposite edges equal. So, perhaps I can model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant to compute the volume.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB= a, AC= b, AD= c, BC= d, BD= e, CD= f is given by:\n\nVolume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the matrix:\n\n0 1 1 1 1\n\n1 0 a\u00b2 b\u00b2 c\u00b2\n\n1 a\u00b2 0 d\u00b2 e\u00b2\n\n1 b\u00b2 d\u00b2 0 f\u00b2\n\n1 c\u00b2 e\u00b2 f\u00b2 0\n\nBut in our case, the edges are:\n\nAB=\u221a41, AC=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89,\n\nBC=\u221a89, BD=\u221a80, CD=\u221a41.\n\nSo, a=AB=\u221a41, b=AC=\u221a80, c=AD=\u221a89,\n\nd=BC=\u221a89, e=BD=\u221a80, f=CD=\u221a41.\n\nSo, the CM determinant matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, (\u221a41)^2, (\u221a80)^2, (\u221a89)^2\n\nRow 2: 1, (\u221a41)^2, 0, (\u221a89)^2, (\u221a80)^2\n\nRow 3: 1, (\u221a80)^2, (\u221a89)^2, 0, (\u221a41)^2\n\nRow 4: 1, (\u221a89)^2, (\u221a80)^2, (\u221a41)^2, 0\n\nWait, let me compute the squares:\n\n(\u221a41)^2=41,\n\n(\u221a80)^2=80,\n\n(\u221a89)^2=89.\n\nSo, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nNow, compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. That's going to be a bit tedious, but let's try.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant formula for the volume is:\n\nCM = determinant of the above matrix.\n\nThen, Volume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 )\n\nBut let's compute CM.\n\nComputing a 5x5 determinant is complicated. Maybe I can use some properties or symmetry to simplify.\n\nLooking at the matrix, it's symmetric except for the first row and column. Let me write it out:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nHmm, perhaps I can perform some row or column operations to simplify it.\n\nLet me subtract Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4, and 0. Wait, Row 0 is the first row, which is [0,1,1,1,1]. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to subtract Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4, but considering that Row 0 starts with 0. Alternatively, maybe expand along the first row.\n\nThe determinant can be expanded along the first row (Row 0). The first element is 0, so that term is zero. Then, the determinant is:\n\n-1 * det(minor of element (0,1)) + 1 * det(minor of element (0,2)) - 1 * det(minor of element (0,3)) + 1 * det(minor of element (0,4)).\n\nWait, actually, the cofactor expansion for the first row is:\n\nsum_{j=0 to 4} (-1)^{0+j} * M[0][j] * det(minor(0,j)).\n\nSince M[0][0] is 0, the first term is zero. Then,\n\n= (-1)^{0+1} * 1 * det(minor(0,1)) \n\n+ (-1)^{0+2} * 1 * det(minor(0,2))\n\n+ (-1)^{0+3} * 1 * det(minor(0,3))\n\n+ (-1)^{0+4} * 1 * det(minor(0,4)).\n\nSo, that's:\n\n- det(minor(0,1)) + det(minor(0,2)) - det(minor(0,3)) + det(minor(0,4)).\n\nNow, each minor is the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing row 0 and column j.\n\nLet me compute each minor:\n\nMinor for (0,1): remove row 0 and column 1.\n\nSo, the minor matrix is:\n\nRow 1: 1, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the original matrix is 5x5. When we remove row 0 and column 1, the minor is a 4x4 matrix:\n\nThe remaining rows are 1,2,3,4 and columns 0,2,3,4.\n\nSo, the minor matrix is:\n\nRow 1: 1, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\nRow 0: 0,1,1,1,1\n\nRow 1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow 2:1,41,0,89,80\n\nRow 3:1,80,89,0,41\n\nRow 4:1,89,80,41,0\n\nSo, removing column 1 (index 1) gives us the columns 0,2,3,4. So, for each row, the entries are:\n\nRow1: 1,41,80,89\n\nRow2:1,0,89,80\n\nRow3:1,89,0,41\n\nRow4:1,80,41,0\n\nSo, minor(0,1) is:\n\n1 41 80 89\n\n1 0 89 80\n\n1 89 0 41\n\n1 80 41 0\n\nSimilarly, minor(0,2) is removing column 2, so columns 0,1,3,4.\n\nRow1:1,0,80,89\n\nRow2:1,41,89,80\n\nRow3:1,80,0,41\n\nRow4:1,89,41,0\n\nSimilarly, minor(0,3) removes column 3, so columns 0,1,2,4.\n\nRow1:1,0,41,89\n\nRow2:1,41,0,80\n\nRow3:1,80,89,41\n\nRow4:1,89,80,0\n\nAnd minor(0,4) removes column4, so columns 0,1,2,3.\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80\n\nRow2:1,41,0,89\n\nRow3:1,80,89,0\n\nRow4:1,89,80,41\n\nSo, now, the determinant expansion becomes:\n\n- det(minor(0,1)) + det(minor(0,2)) - det(minor(0,3)) + det(minor(0,4)).\n\nBut computing these 4x4 determinants is still tedious. Maybe there's a pattern or symmetry I can exploit.\n\nLooking at minor(0,1):\n\n1 41 80 89\n\n1 0 89 80\n\n1 89 0 41\n\n1 80 41 0\n\nI notice that the matrix is symmetric in some way. Let's see:\n\nLooking at rows 1 and 2: [1,41,80,89] and [1,0,89,80]. Hmm, not obvious.\n\nWait, maybe I can perform row operations to simplify.\n\nLet me subtract Row1 from Rows 2,3,4.\n\nSo, for minor(0,1):\n\nRow1:1 41 80 89\n\nRow2:1 0 89 80\n\nRow3:1 89 0 41\n\nRow4:1 80 41 0\n\nSubtract Row1 from Row2: Row2' = Row2 - Row1 \u2192 [0, -41, 9, -9]\n\nSubtract Row1 from Row3: Row3' = Row3 - Row1 \u2192 [0,48, -80, -48]\n\nSubtract Row1 from Row4: Row4' = Row4 - Row1 \u2192 [0,39, -39, -89]\n\nSo, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow1:1 41 80 89\n\nRow2':0 -41 9 -9\n\nRow3':0 48 -80 -48\n\nRow4':0 39 -39 -89\n\nNow, the determinant remains the same as before the row operations, which is equal to the determinant of the transformed matrix. Now, since we have zeros in the first column, except for the first row, we can expand along the first column.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n1 * det(minor of 1 in Row1, Col1) \n\n= 1 * det of the submatrix:\n\nRow2': -41 9 -9\n\nRow3':48 -80 -48\n\nRow4':39 -39 -89\n\nCompute this 3x3 determinant.\n\nCompute:\n\n-41*( (-80)*(-89) - (-48)*(-39) ) - 9*(48*(-89) - (-48)*39) + (-9)*(48*(-39) - (-80)*39 )\n\nWait, let me compute each cofactor:\n\n= -41 * [ (-80)(-89) - (-48)(-39) ] \n\n- 9 * [48*(-89) - (-48)*39 ]\n\n+ (-9) * [48*(-39) - (-80)*39 ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term:\n\n(-80)(-89) = 7120\n\n(-48)(-39) = 1872\n\nSo, [7120 - 1872] = 5248\n\nSo, first term: -41 * 5248 = -41 * 5248\n\nWait, let me compute 5248 * 40 = 209,920; 5248 *1=5,248 \u2192 total 215,168. So, -41 *5248 = -215,168.\n\nSecond term:\n\n48*(-89) = -4272\n\n(-48)*39 = -1872\n\nSo, [ -4272 - (-1872) ] = -4272 + 1872 = -2400\n\nMultiply by -9: -9*(-2400)=21,600.\n\nThird term:\n\n48*(-39) = -1,872\n\n(-80)*39 = -3,120\n\nSo, [ -1872 - (-3120) ] = -1872 + 3120 = 1248\n\nMultiply by (-9): -9*1248 = -11,232.\n\nSo, sum all three terms:\n\n-215,168 + 21,600 -11,232.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n-215,168 +21,600 = -193,568\n\n-193,568 -11,232 = -204,800\n\nSo, the determinant of minor(0,1) is -204,800.\n\nBut wait, the determinant of minor(0,1) is -204,800, but in the expansion, we have -det(minor(0,1)) which is -(-204,800) = 204,800.\n\nWait, no: the cofactor expansion for the determinant is:\n\ndet = (-1)^{0+1} * 1 * det(minor(0,1)) \n\n+ (-1)^{0+2} * 1 * det(minor(0,2)) \n\n- (-1)^{0+3} * 1 * det(minor(0,3)) \n\n+ (-1)^{0+4} * 1 * det(minor(0,4)).\n\nWait, no, the overall expansion is:\n\n- det(minor(0,1)) + det(minor(0,2)) - det(minor(0,3)) + det(minor(0,4)).\n\nSo, we computed det(minor(0,1)) as -204,800. So, the first term is -(-204,800) = +204,800.\n\nWait, no, wait: the expansion is:\n\n- det(minor(0,1)) + det(minor(0,2)) - det(minor(0,3)) + det(minor(0,4)).\n\nSo, the first term is - det(minor(0,1)).\n\nWe computed det(minor(0,1)) as -204,800.\n\nSo, - det(minor(0,1)) = -(-204,800) = +204,800.\n\nNow, I need to compute the other minors: det(minor(0,2)), det(minor(0,3)), det(minor(0,4)).\n\nThis will take a lot of time, but perhaps there's a pattern.

But let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, the expansion is:\n\n- det(minor(0,1)) + det(minor(0,2)) - det(minor(0,3)) + det(minor(0,4)).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- (-204,800) \u2192 +204,800\n\n+202,304\n\n- (-204,800) \u2192 +204,800\n\n+204,800\n\nSo, adding all together:\n\n204,800 +202,304 +204,800 +204,800.\n\nWhich is 204,800 *3 +202,304=614,400 +202,304=816,704.\n\nSo, determinant CM is 816,704.\n\nWait, but the CM determinant is supposed to be positive? Or can it be negative?\n\nWait, the determinant is 816,704.\n\nThen, the volume is sqrt( |CM| / 288 ).\n\nSo, Volume = sqrt(816,704 / 288 ).\n\nSimplify 816,704 /288.\n\nFirst, let's compute 816,704 \u00f7 16 =51,044.\n\n288 \u00f716=18.\n\nSo, 51,044 /18.\n\n51,044 \u00f7 2=25,522.\n\n18 \u00f72=9.\n\nSo, 25,522 /9 \u22482,835.777...\n\nWait, but let me see if 25,522 and 9 have any common factors. 25,522 \u00f72=12,761. 9 is 3\u00b2. 12,761 is likely a prime number.\n\nSo, 25,522 /9= (2 *12,761)/9=2/9 *12,761.\n\nSo, 816,704 /288= (816,704 \u00f716)/(288 \u00f716)=51,044 /18= (51,044 \u00f72)/(18 \u00f72)=25,522 /9.\n\nSo, Volume = sqrt(25,522 /9 )=sqrt(25,522)/3.\n\nWait, but 25,522=2*12,761. Let me check if 12,761 is a square.\n\nCompute sqrt(12,761)= around 113, since 113\u00b2=12,769. Close, but 113\u00b2=12,769, which is 8 more than 12,761. So, 12,761 is not a perfect square.\n\nSo, Volume = sqrt(25,522)/3= sqrt(2*12,761)/3.\n\nHmm, that seems messy. Did I make a mistake in computing the determinant?\n\nBecause the volume should be a rational multiple of sqrt(something). Maybe I made a computational error in calculating the determinant.\n\nWait, let me recheck the earlier steps. Computing the determinant for a 5x5 matrix is error-prone.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Since all faces are congruent triangles, maybe the volume can be computed using another method.\n\nEach face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. Let me compute the area of one face first.\n\nUsing Heron's formula:\n\ns = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2.\n\nBut that's complicated. Alternatively, use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nBut with a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(a + b + c)=\u221a41 +\u221a80 +\u221a89\n\n(-a + b + c)= -\u221a41 +\u221a80 +\u221a89\n\n(a - b + c)= \u221a41 -\u221a80 +\u221a89\n\n(a + b - c)= \u221a41 +\u221a80 -\u221a89\n\nBut this might not simplify easily.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4) )\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recall.\n\nActually, the formula is:\n\n16 Area\u00b2 = 2(a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2) - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4)\n\nSo, let me compute that.\n\nGiven a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nCompute a\u00b2=41, b\u00b2=80, c\u00b2=89.\n\nCompute 2(a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2)=2*(41*80 +80*89 +89*41)\n\nCompute each product:\n\n41*80=3,280\n\n80*89=7,120\n\n89*41=3,649\n\nSo, sum:3,280 +7,120=10,400 +3,649=14,049.\n\nMultiply by 2:28,098.\n\nNow, compute (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2 = (41 +80 +89)^2=(210)^2=44,100.\n\nCompute a^4 + b^4 + c^4=41\u00b2 +80\u00b2 +89\u00b2=1,681 +6,400 +7,921=15,  let's compute:\n\n41\u00b2=1,681\n\n80\u00b2=6,400\n\n89\u00b2=7,921\n\nSum:1,681 +6,400=8,081 +7,921=16,002.\n\nSo, 16 Area\u00b2=28,098 -16,002=12,096.\n\nThus, Area\u00b2=12,096 /16=756.\n\nSo, Area=\u221a756=\u221a(36*21)=6\u221a21.\n\nSo, each face has area 6\u221a21.\n\nNow, the total surface area is 4 *6\u221a21=24\u221a21.\n\nSo, the total surface area is 24\u221a21.\n\nNow, to find the inradius, we can use the formula:\n\ninradius = 3 * Volume / Surface Area.\n\nSo, I need to compute the Volume.\n\nWait, but earlier using the Cayley-Menger determinant, I got Volume = sqrt(816,704 /288 )= sqrt(25,522 /9 )= sqrt(25,522)/3.\n\nBut this seems messy, so perhaps I made a mistake in the CM determinant computation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume using another method.\n\nSince the tetrahedron is a disphenoid with all faces congruent, there's a formula for the volume in terms of the face areas and the dihedral angles, but that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for a disphenoid: Volume = (4/3) * sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) ) / 8.\n\nWait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps in a disphenoid, the volume can be computed as sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) ) / 72.\n\nWait, I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to use the formula I derived earlier.\n\nAlternatively, since all faces are congruent and have area 6\u221a21, perhaps I can find the volume another way.\n\nWait, another approach: In a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated if we know the edge lengths and the face areas.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron in terms of the face areas and the dihedral angles between the faces. But that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3) * Area^2 * (sqrt( something )) ?\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the tetrahedron as two congruent triangles hinged along an edge.\n\nWait, another idea: since all faces are congruent, perhaps the tetrahedron is isohedral, and the inradius can be related to the volume and the surface area.\n\nWait, but I still need the volume.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula for the volume of a disphenoid.\n\nUpon checking, the formula for the volume of a disphenoid is:\n\nVolume = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )) / 72.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about this formula. Let me think.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid, the volume can be computed using the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3) * sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) ) / 8.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me look for another way.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the volume using vectors.\n\nAssume that points A, B, C, D are positioned such that vectors AB, AC, AD are from point A.\n\nBut without knowing the exact coordinates, it's difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps assign coordinates in a way that the centroid is at the origin, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the formula that for a tetrahedron with congruent faces, the volume can be computed as sqrt( (Area^2 * 3\u221a3 ) / 16 ).\n\nWait, no, that's for a regular tetrahedron.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nWait, each face is a triangle with area 6\u221a21.\n\nIf I can find the height of the tetrahedron from a vertex to the opposite face, then Volume = (1/3)*base_area*height.\n\nBut without knowing the height, it's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the formula involving the inradius.\n\nWait, inradius = 3*Volume / SurfaceArea.\n\nBut since I don't know Volume, I can't compute inradius directly.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I can find the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant again, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.\n\nLet me try to compute the determinant again.\n\nWait, earlier I computed the determinant CM as 816,704, but perhaps I made an error in the cofactor expansion.\n\nWait, the determinant expansion was:\n\ndet = - det(minor(0,1)) + det(minor(0,2)) - det(minor(0,3)) + det(minor(0,4)).\n\nWhich was:\n\n204,800 +202,304 +204,800 +204,800.\n\nWait, that can't be, because when I computed det(minor(0,3)), I got -204,800, so - det(minor(0,3))=204,800.\n\nSimilarly, det(minor(0,4))=204,800.\n\nSo, adding all together:\n\n204,800 (from - det(minor(0,1)))\n\n+202,304 (from det(minor(0,2)))\n\n+204,800 (from - det(minor(0,3)))\n\n+204,800 (from det(minor(0,4)))\n\nTotal: 204,800 +202,304=407,104; 407,104 +204,800=611,904; 611,904 +204,800=816,704.\n\nSo, the determinant is 816,704.\n\nThen, Volume = sqrt(816,704 / 288).\n\nCompute 816,704 \u00f7288:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16: 816,704 \u00f716=51,044; 288 \u00f716=18.\n\nSo, 51,044 /18.\n\n51,044 \u00f72=25,522; 18 \u00f72=9.\n\nSo, 25,522 /9.\n\n25,522 \u00f79=2,835.777..., which is 2,835 and 7/9.\n\nBut that's not a perfect square. So, Volume = sqrt(25,522 /9 )=sqrt(25,522)/3.\n\nBut 25,522=2*12,761.\n\nWait, 12,761: let me check if it's a square.\n\nCompute 113\u00b2=12,769, which is larger than 12,761 by 8. So, 12,761 is not a perfect square.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the volume is sqrt(25,522)/3, which seems messy.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nWait, let me check the determinant again.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake in the sign during the cofactor expansion.\n\nWait, the determinant of the 5x5 matrix is:\n\nRow0:0,1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow2:1,41,0,89,80\n\nRow3:1,80,89,0,41\n\nRow4:1,89,80,41,0\n\nAnd I expanded along Row0, getting:\n\n- det(minor(0,1)) + det(minor(0,2)) - det(minor(0,3)) + det(minor(0,4)).\n\nBut perhaps the signs are incorrect.\n\nWait, the cofactor expansion alternates signs based on (-1)^(i+j). For Row0, the signs are:\n\nj=0: (-1)^(0+0)=1 \u2192 but since the first element is 0, it doesn't contribute.\n\nj=1: (-1)^(0+1)=-1\n\nj=2: (-1)^(0+2)=+1\n\nj=3: (-1)^(0+3)=-1\n\nj=4: (-1)^(0+4)=+1\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n0*... \n\n-1 * det(minor(0,1)) \n\n+1 * det(minor(0,2)) \n\n-1 * det(minor(0,3)) \n\n+1 * det(minor(0,4)).\n\nSo, it's:\n\n- det(minor(0,1)) + det(minor(0,2)) - det(minor(0,3)) + det(minor(0,4)).\n\nWhich is what I did.\n\nHmm. So, unless I made a mistake in calculating the minors, the determinant is 816,704.\n\nBut then, the volume would be sqrt(816,704 / 288 ).\n\nCompute 816,704 \u00f7288:\n\nLet me compute 288 * 2835 = 288 *2800=806,400; 288*35=10,080 \u2192 total 816,480.\n\nSo, 288 *2835=816,480.\n\nSubtract from 816,704: 816,704 -816,480=224.\n\nSo, 816,704=288*2835 +224.\n\n224=288*(224/288)=288*(7/9).\n\nSo, 816,704=288*(2835 +7/9)=288*(25,522/9).\n\nWait, because 2835=25,522/9? Wait, 2835 *9=25,515. Hmm, no.\n\nWait, 2835 *9=25,515. But 25,522 -25,515=7, so 25,522=2835*9 +7.\n\nSo, 816,704=288*(2835 +7/9)=288*(25,515 +7)/9=288*(25,522)/9.\n\nSo, 816,704 /288=25,522 /9.\n\nThus, Volume= sqrt(25,522 /9 )=sqrt(25,522)/3.\n\nHmm. Now, sqrt(25,522). Let's factor 25,522.\n\nDivide by 2:25,522=2*12,761.\n\n12,761: check divisibility.\n\nCheck if 12,761 is divisible by small primes:\n\nSum of digits:1+2+7+6+1=17, not divisible by 3.\n\n12,761 \u00f77=1,823 \u2192 7*1,823=12,761? 7*1,800=12,600; 7*23=161 \u2192 12,600+161=12,761. Yes!\n\nSo, 12,761=7*1,823.\n\nCheck if 1,823 is prime.\n\nCheck divisibility: 1,823 \u00f713=140.23\u2026 no.\n\n\u221a1,823\u224842.7.

Since 1,823 is prime, this cannot be simplified further.\n\nSo, Volume= sqrt(2*7*1,823)/3= sqrt(25,522)/3.\n\nHmm, that seems complicated. Perhaps I made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial edge lengths are incorrect in the CM determinant.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, AB=CD=\u221a41, AC=BD=\u221a80, BC=AD=\u221a89.\n\nSo, the edges are:\n\nAB=\u221a41,\n\nAC=\u221a80,\n\nAD=\u221a89,\n\nBC=\u221a89,\n\nBD=\u221a80,\n\nCD=\u221a41.\n\nSo, in the CM determinant, the edges are:\n\nAB^2=41,\n\nAC^2=80,\n\nAD^2=89,\n\nBC^2=89,\n\nBD^2=80,\n\nCD^2=41.\n\nSo, the matrix is correct as I set it up.\n\nSo, perhaps the determinant is correct.\n\nBut then, the volume is sqrt(25,522)/3, which is approximately sqrt(25,522)=159.76, so Volume\u2248159.76/3\u224853.25.\n\nBut I need an exact value.\n\nWait, but the inradius is 3*Volume / SurfaceArea.\n\nSurfaceArea=4*6\u221a21=24\u221a21.\n\nSo, inradius= 3*(sqrt(25,522)/3 ) / (24\u221a21 )= sqrt(25,522)/(24\u221a21 ).\n\nSimplify sqrt(25,522)/(24\u221a21 )= sqrt(25,522)/(24\u221a21 ).\n\nBut sqrt(25,522)=sqrt(2*7*1,823). Hmm, no way to simplify further.\n\nWait, but 25,522=2*7*1,823. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant approach, perhaps the sign is wrong.\n\nBecause if the determinant is negative, then the volume would be imaginary, which is impossible.\n\nWait, the determinant should be positive if the points are in a certain order.\n\nWait, perhaps the determinant is negative, so Volume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ).\n\nBut in my calculation, the determinant was positive. So, Volume is real.\n\nWait, maybe I need to accept that the volume is sqrt(25,522)/3.\n\nBut then, the inradius is sqrt(25,522)/(24\u221a21 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\nsqrt(25,522)/(24\u221a21 )= sqrt(25,522)/(24\u221a21 ).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):\n\n= sqrt(25,522)*sqrt(21)/(24*21 )\n\n= sqrt(25,522*21 )/(504 )\n\nCompute 25,522*21:\n\n25,522 *20=510,440\n\n25,522 *1=25,522\n\nTotal=510,440 +25,522=535,962.\n\nSo, sqrt(535,962)/504.\n\nFactor 535,962:\n\nDivide by 2:535,962=2*267,981.\n\n267,981: sum of digits=2+6+7+9+8+1=33, divisible by 3.\n\n267,981 \u00f73=89,327.\n\n89,327: check divisibility by 3:8+9+3+2+7=29, not divisible by 3.\n\nCheck divisibility by 7:89,327 \u00f77\u224812,761. 7*12,761=89,327.\n\nSo, 535,962=2*3*7*12,761.\n\nSo, sqrt(535,962)=sqrt(2*3*7*12,761).\n\nBut 12,761 is 7*1,823, as before.\n\nSo, sqrt(535,962)=sqrt(2*3*7^2 *1,823)=7*sqrt(2*3*1,823)=7*sqrt(10,938).\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nThis suggests that the inradius is 7*sqrt(10,938)/504= sqrt(10,938)/72.\n\nBut 10,938=2*3*1,823.\n\nSo, sqrt(10,938)=sqrt(2*3*1,823). No simplification.\n\nSo, inradius= sqrt(2*3*1,823)/72= sqrt(10,938)/72.\n\nBut 10,938=2*3*1,823.\n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant approach, and there's a simpler way.\n\nWait, another approach: Since all faces are congruent, maybe the tetrahedron is isohedral, and the inradius can be found using some properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the formula for inradius in terms of the volume and surface area.\n\nBut since I can't compute the volume easily, maybe I should find another way.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the inradius in a disphenoid.\n\nUpon checking, in a disphenoid, the inradius can be calculated if the edge lengths are known, but I can't recall the exact formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the inradius in terms of the volume and the surface area.\n\nWait, inradius=3V/S, where V is volume and S is surface area.\n\nI have S=24\u221a21.\n\nSo, if I can find V, I can find the inradius.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute V using another formula.\n\nWait, another idea: Since all faces are congruent, perhaps the tetrahedron is isohedral, and thus, the volume can be computed as (4/3) times the volume of one face times the inradius.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps using the formula V = (1/3) * S * r, where S is the total surface area, but no, that's for a pyramid with a single base.\n\nWait, no, the formula for a tetrahedron is V = (1/3) * base area * height.\n\nBut without knowing the height, it's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the formula that relates the inradius to the volume and surface area.\n\nYes, inradius r = 3V/S.\n\nSo, if I can find V, I can find r.\n\nBut to find V, perhaps I can use the formula for the volume of a disphenoid.\n\nUpon checking, the formula for the volume of a disphenoid is:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )) / 72.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me check the source.\n\nWait, upon checking, the formula for the volume of a disphenoid with edges a, b, c, a, b, c is:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )) / 72.\n\nBut in our case, the edges are AB=\u221a41, AC=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89, and the opposite edges are equal.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula applies.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nCompute (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)=41 +80 -89=32.\n\nCompute (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)=41 -80 +89=50.\n\nCompute (-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)= -41 +80 +89=128.\n\nSo, the product is 32*50*128.\n\nCompute 32*50=1,600.\n\n1,600*128=204,800.\n\nSo, V = sqrt(204,800)/72.\n\nsqrt(204,800)=sqrt(2048 *100)=10*sqrt(2048).\n\nsqrt(2048)=sqrt(1024*2)=32\u221a2.\n\nSo, sqrt(204,800)=10*32\u221a2=320\u221a2.\n\nThus, V=320\u221a2 /72= (320/72)*\u221a2= (40/9)*\u221a2.\n\nSimplify: 40/9 is already reduced.\n\nSo, V= (40\u221a2)/9.\n\nWait, that seems better.\n\nSo, Volume=40\u221a2/9.\n\nThen, SurfaceArea=24\u221a21.\n\nSo, inradius r=3V/S=3*(40\u221a2/9)/(24\u221a21 )= (120\u221a2/9)/(24\u221a21 )= (120\u221a2)/(9*24\u221a21 )= (120\u221a2)/(216\u221a21 ).\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\n120/216=5/9.\n\nSo, r= (5\u221a2)/(9\u221a21 ).\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21:\n\n= (5\u221a2 *\u221a21 )/(9*21 )\n\n=5\u221a42 / (189 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\u221a42 is already square-free.\n\nSo, r=5\u221a42 /189.\n\nBut 5 and 189 are coprime, and 42 is square-free.\n\nSo, the distance is 5\u221a42 /189.\n\nThus, m=5, n=42, p=189.\n\nBut wait, 189=9*21=9*3*7. So, 5 and 189 are coprime.\n\nBut 42 is square-free.\n\nSo, m +n +p=5+42+189=236.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the Volume calculation.\n\nUsing the disphenoid volume formula:\n\nV= sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 -c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 +c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) ) /72.\n\nPlugging in a\u00b2=41, b\u00b2=80, c\u00b2=89.\n\nSo, (41 +80 -89)=32,\n\n(41 -80 +89)=50,\n\n(-41 +80 +89)=128.\n\nProduct=32*50*128=204,800.\n\nsqrt(204,800)=sqrt(2048*100)=sqrt(2048)*10.\n\n2048=1024*2=32\u00b2*2. So, sqrt(2048)=32\u221a2.\n\nThus, sqrt(204,800)=32\u221a2 *10=320\u221a2.\n\nSo, V=320\u221a2 /72= (320/72)*\u221a2= (40/9)\u221a2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, Volume=40\u221a2/9.\n\nThen, SurfaceArea=4*6\u221a21=24\u221a21.\n\nThus, inradius r=3V/S=3*(40\u221a2/9)/(24\u221a21 )= (120\u221a2/9)/(24\u221a21 )= (120\u221a2)/(216\u221a21 )= (5\u221a2)/(9\u221a21 )=5\u221a42/(9*21 )=5\u221a42/189.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the distance is 5\u221a42/189.\n\nSimplify: 5 and 189 are coprime, 42 is square-free.\n\nThus, m=5, n=42, p=189.\n\nSo, m +n +p=5+42+189=236.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{236}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given with specific lengths: AB and CD are both \u221a41, AC and BD are both \u221a80, and BC and AD are both \u221a89. I need to find the distance from the incenter (a point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer should be in the form m\u221an/p, where m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then I have to find m + n + p.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula: \n\ninradius = 3 * (volume) / (sum of the areas of the four faces)\n\nSo, I need to compute the volume of the tetrahedron and the areas of each face.\n\nBut wait, the tetrahedron has some symmetry because opposite edges are equal. So AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD. That suggests that the tetrahedron is \"isohedral\" or at least has some symmetry which might make calculations easier.\n\nMaybe I can assign coordinates to the vertices to make it easier. Let's try to place the points in a coordinate system.\n\nLet me denote the points as A, B, C, D. Since opposite edges are equal, perhaps this tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system where the coordinates of the points are symmetric in some way.\n\nI recall that for such symmetric tetrahedrons, sometimes you can place them such that the coordinates are symmetric around the origin. For example, perhaps A and C are symmetric with respect to the origin, as are B and D.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to assign coordinates step by step.\n\nLet me try to place point A at (a, b, c), point B at (d, e, f), point C at (-a, -b, -c), and point D at (-d, -e, -f). Then, the opposite edges would have the same lengths because of the symmetry.\n\nWait, let's check: AB would be the distance between A and B, which is \u221a[(d - a)^2 + (e - b)^2 + (f - c)^2]. CD would be the distance between C and D, which is \u221a[(-d + a)^2 + (-e + b)^2 + (-f + c)^2] = \u221a[(a - d)^2 + (b - e)^2 + (c - f)^2] which is the same as AB. So that's good, AB = CD.\n\nSimilarly, AC is the distance between A and C, which is \u221a[(-a - a)^2 + (-b - b)^2 + (-c - c)^2] = \u221a[(-2a)^2 + (-2b)^2 + (-2c)^2] = \u221a[4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2 + 4c\u00b2] = 2\u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2). Similarly, BD is the distance between B and D, which would be \u221a[(-d - d)^2 + (-e - e)^2 + (-f - f)^2] = 2\u221a(d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2). So AC = BD implies that 2\u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 2\u221a(d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2), so a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, BC is the distance between B and C: \u221a[(-a - d)^2 + (-b - e)^2 + (-c - f)^2], and AD is the distance between A and D: \u221a[(-d - a)^2 + (-e - b)^2 + (-f - c)^2]. So BC and AD are the same, which aligns with the problem statement.\n\nSo, this coordinate system seems plausible. Let me try to assign coordinates accordingly.\n\nLet me let A = (a, b, c), B = (d, e, f), C = (-a, -b, -c), D = (-d, -e, -f).\n\nSo, the edges are as given.\n\nGiven that AB = CD = \u221a41, AC = BD = \u221a80, and BC = AD = \u221a89.\n\nSo, AB^2 = (d - a)^2 + (e - b)^2 + (f - c)^2 = 41.\n\nAC^2 = ( -a - a)^2 + (-b - b)^2 + (-c - c)^2 = 4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2 +4c\u00b2 = 80 \u2192 4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 80 \u2192 a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, BD^2 = (-d - d)^2 + (-e - e)^2 + (-f - f)^2 = 4d\u00b2 +4e\u00b2 +4f\u00b2 = 80 \u2192 same as AC, so 4(d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2) =80 \u2192 d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 =20. So, we have a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 =20.\n\nNow, BC is the distance between B and C: \u221a[(-a - d)^2 + (-b - e)^2 + (-c - f)^2]^2 = (a + d)^2 + (b + e)^2 + (c + f)^2 = 89.\n\nAD is the distance between A and D: \u221a[(-d - a)^2 + (-e - b)^2 + (-f - c)^2]^2 = (a + d)^2 + (b + e)^2 + (c + f)^2 =89. So, same as BC.\n\nSo, BC^2 = (a + d)^2 + (b + e)^2 + (c + f)^2 =89.\n\nSimilarly, AB^2 = (d - a)^2 + (e - b)^2 + (f - c)^2 =41.\n\nSo, let me write down:\n\nEquation 1: (d - a)^2 + (e - b)^2 + (f - c)^2 =41.\n\nEquation 2: (a + d)^2 + (b + e)^2 + (c + f)^2 =89.\n\nWe also know that a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =20 and d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2=20.\n\nLet me expand Equation 1 and Equation 2.\n\nEquation 1: (d\u00b2 - 2ad + a\u00b2) + (e\u00b2 - 2be + b\u00b2) + (f\u00b2 - 2cf + c\u00b2) =41.\n\nWhich is (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + (d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2) - 2(ad + be + cf) =41.\n\nWe know a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =20 and d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2=20, so 20 +20 - 2(ad + be + cf)=41.\n\nSo, 40 - 2(ad + be + cf)=41 \u2192 -2(ad + be + cf)=1 \u2192 ad + be + cf= -1/2.\n\nEquation 2: (a + d)^2 + (b + e)^2 + (c + f)^2 =89.\n\nExpanding, a\u00b2 + 2ad + d\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2be + e\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2cf + f\u00b2 =89.\n\nWhich is (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + (d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2) + 2(ad + be + cf)=89.\n\nAgain, 20 +20 + 2(ad + be + cf)=89.\n\nSo, 40 + 2(ad + be + cf)=89 \u2192 2(ad + be + cf)=49 \u2192 ad + be + cf=24.5.\n\nWait, that's a problem. From Equation 1, ad + be + cf = -1/2. From Equation 2, ad + be + cf =49/2=24.5.\n\nBut that's a contradiction. -1/2 \u226024.5. So, something must be wrong.\n\nHmm, perhaps my initial assumption about the coordinates is incorrect. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the tetrahedron isn't symmetric in the way I thought. Maybe I can't assign points A, B, C, D as I did. Maybe I need to choose a different coordinate system.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron is such that all edges are equal in pairs, but not in a symmetric way. Maybe it's better to use vectors or another method.\n\nWait, another approach: since all opposite edges are equal, maybe this tetrahedron is \"equifacial\" or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a disphenoid, which is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal.\n\nYes! I remember that a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, so this must be a disphenoid.\n\nIn a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Wait, actually, in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent in pairs. So, perhaps each pair of opposite faces are congruent.\n\nBut in this problem, the edges are such that AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD, but each of the faces is a triangle with edges from these. So, maybe each face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89, but wait, that can't be because each face is a triangle, so each face must have three edges.\n\nWait, no, each face is a triangle, but each face has edges from the given edges. Let me think: For face ABC, the edges are AB, BC, and AC. So, AB=\u221a41, BC=\u221a89, and AC=\u221a80.\n\nSimilarly, face ABD has edges AB=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89.\n\nSame for other faces. So, each face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89.\n\nWait, so all four faces are congruent triangles. So, each face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. So, the tetrahedron is a regular-faced tetrahedron, meaning all faces are congruent. That's a special case of a disphenoid.\n\nIf all faces are congruent, then the tetrahedron is called isohedral, and perhaps it's easier to compute the volume and the areas.\n\nSo, first, compute the area of each face. Since each face is a triangle with sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nWait, let me compute the area of one face using Heron's formula.\n\nCompute the semi-perimeter: s = (a + b + c)/2 = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2.\n\nBut Heron's formula might get messy with square roots. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for area in terms of sides and the cosine law to find the height.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using vectors or coordinates is a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron if I can find the coordinates of the points. Since all faces are congruent, maybe the tetrahedron is regular, but no, in a regular tetrahedron all edges are equal, which is not the case here.\n\nWait, maybe it's a tetragonal disphenoid, which has four congruent triangular faces and opposite edges equal. So, perhaps I can model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant to compute the volume.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB= a, AC= b, AD= c, BC= d, BD= e, CD= f is given by:\n\nVolume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the matrix:\n\n0 1 1 1 1\n\n1 0 a\u00b2 b\u00b2 c\u00b2\n\n1 a\u00b2 0 d\u00b2 e\u00b2\n\n1 b\u00b2 d\u00b2 0 f\u00b2\n\n1 c\u00b2 e\u00b2 f\u00b2 0\n\nBut in our case, the edges are:\n\nAB=\u221a41, AC=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89,\n\nBC=\u221a89, BD=\u221a80, CD=\u221a41.\n\nSo, a=AB=\u221a41, b=AC=\u221a80, c=AD=\u221a89,\n\nd=BC=\u221a89, e=BD=\u221a80, f=CD=\u221a41.\n\nSo, the CM determinant matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, (\u221a41)^2, (\u221a80)^2, (\u221a89)^2\n\nRow 2: 1, (\u221a41)^2, 0, (\u221a89)^2, (\u221a80)^2\n\nRow 3: 1, (\u221a80)^2, (\u221a89)^2, 0, (\u221a41)^2\n\nRow 4: 1, (\u221a89)^2, (\u221a80)^2, (\u221a41)^2, 0\n\nWait, let me compute the squares:\n\n(\u221a41)^2=41,\n\n(\u221a80)^2=80,\n\n(\u221a89)^2=89.\n\nSo, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nNow, compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. That's going to be a bit tedious, but let's try.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant formula for the volume is:\n\nCM = determinant of the above matrix.\n\nThen, Volume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 )\n\nBut let's compute CM.\n\nComputing a 5x5 determinant is complicated. Maybe I can use some properties or symmetry to simplify.\n\nLooking at the matrix, it's symmetric except for the first row and column. Let me write it out:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nHmm, perhaps I can perform some row or column operations to simplify it.\n\nLet me subtract Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4, and 0. Wait, Row 0 is the first row, which is [0,1,1,1,1]. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to subtract Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4, but considering that Row 0 starts with 0. Alternatively, maybe expand along the first row.\n\nThe determinant can be expanded along the first row (Row 0). The first element is 0, so that term is zero. Then, the determinant is:\n\n-1 * det(minor of element (0,1)) + 1 * det(minor of element (0,2)) - 1 * det(minor of element (0,3)) + 1 * det(minor of element (0,4)).\n\nWait, actually, the cofactor expansion for the first row is:\n\nsum_{j=0 to 4} (-1)^{0+j} * M[0][j] * det(minor(0,j)).\n\nSince M[0][0] is 0, the first term is zero. Then,\n\n= (-1)^{0+1} * 1 * det(minor(0,1)) \n\n+ (-1)^{0+2} * 1 * det(minor(0,2))\n\n+ (-1)^{0+3} * 1 * det(minor(0,3))\n\n+ (-1)^{0+4} * 1 * det(minor(0,4)).\n\nSo, that's:\n\n- det(minor(0,1)) + det(minor(0,2)) - det(minor(0,3)) + det(minor(0,4)).\n\nNow, each minor is the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing row 0 and column j.\n\nLet me compute each minor:\n\nMinor for (0,1): remove row 0 and column 1.\n\nSo, the minor matrix is:\n\nRow 1: 1, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the original matrix is 5x5. When we remove row 0 and column 1, the minor is a 4x4 matrix:\n\nThe remaining rows are 1,2,3,4 and columns 0,2,3,4.\n\nSo, the minor matrix is:\n\nRow 1: 1, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\nRow 0: 0,1,1,1,1\n\nRow 1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow 2:1,41,0,89,80\n\nRow 3:1,80,89,0,41\n\nRow 4:1,89,80,41,0\n\nSo, removing column 1 (index 1) gives us the columns 0,2,3,4. So, for each row, the entries are:\n\nRow1: 1,41,80,89\n\nRow2:1,0,89,80\n\nRow3:1,89,0,41\n\nRow4:1,80,41,0\n\nSo, minor(0,1) is:\n\n1 41 80 89\n\n1 0 89 80\n\n1 89 0 41\n\n1 80 41 0\n\nSimilarly, minor(0,2) is removing column 2, so columns 0,1,3,4.\n\nRow1:1,0,80,89\n\nRow2:1,41,89,80\n\nRow3:1,80,0,41\n\nRow4:1,89,41,0\n\nSimilarly, minor(0,3) removes column 3, so columns 0,1,2,4.\n\nRow1:1,0,41,89\n\nRow2:1,41,0,80\n\nRow3:1,80,89,41\n\nRow4:1,89,80,0\n\nAnd minor(0,4) removes column4, so columns 0,1,2,3.\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80\n\nRow2:1,41,0,89\n\nRow3:1,80,89,0\n\nRow4:1,89,80,41\n\nSo, now, the determinant expansion becomes:\n\n- det(minor(0,1)) + det(minor(0,2)) - det(minor(0,3)) + det(minor(0,4)).\n\nBut computing these 4x4 determinants is still tedious. Maybe there's a pattern or symmetry I can exploit.\n\nLooking at minor(0,1):\n\n1 41 80 89\n\n1 0 89 80\n\n1 89 0 41\n\n1 80 41 0\n\nI notice that the matrix is symmetric in some way. Let's see:\n\nLooking at rows 1 and 2: [1,41,80,89] and [1,0,89,80]. Hmm, not obvious.\n\nWait, maybe I can perform row operations to simplify.\n\nLet me subtract Row1 from Rows 2,3,4.\n\nSo, for minor(0,1):\n\nRow1:1 41 80 89\n\nRow2:1 0 89 80\n\nRow3:1 89 0 41\n\nRow4:1 80 41 0\n\nSubtract Row1 from Row2: Row2' = Row2 - Row1 \u2192 [0, -41, 9, -9]\n\nSubtract Row1 from Row3: Row3' = Row3 - Row1 \u2192 [0,48, -80, -48]\n\nSubtract Row1 from Row4: Row4' = Row4 - Row1 \u2192 [0,39, -39, -89]\n\nSo, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow1:1 41 80 89\n\nRow2':0 -41 9 -9\n\nRow3':0 48 -80 -48\n\nRow4':0 39 -39 -89\n\nNow, the determinant remains the same as before the row operations, which is equal to the determinant of the transformed matrix. Now, since we have zeros in the first column, except for the first row, we can expand along the first column.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n1 * det(minor of 1 in Row1, Col1) \n\n= 1 * det of the submatrix:\n\nRow2': -41 9 -9\n\nRow3':48 -80 -48\n\nRow4':39 -39 -89\n\nCompute this 3x3 determinant.\n\nCompute:\n\n-41*( (-80)*(-89) - (-48)*(-39) ) - 9*(48*(-89) - (-48)*39) + (-9)*(48*(-39) - (-80)*39 )\n\nWait, let me compute each cofactor:\n\n= -41 * [ (-80)(-89) - (-48)(-39) ] \n\n- 9 * [48*(-89) - (-48)*39 ]\n\n+ (-9) * [48*(-39) - (-80)*39 ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term:\n\n(-80)(-89) = 7120\n\n(-48)(-39) = 1872\n\nSo, [7120 - 1872] = 5248\n\nSo, first term: -41 * 5248 = -41 * 5248\n\nWait, let me compute 5248 * 40 = 209,920; 5248 *1=5,248 \u2192 total 215,168. So, -41 *5248 = -215,168.\n\nSecond term:\n\n48*(-89) = -4272\n\n(-48)*39 = -1872\n\nSo, [ -4272 - (-1872) ] = -4272 + 1872 = -2400\n\nMultiply by -9: -9*(-2400)=21,600.\n\nThird term:\n\n48*(-39) = -1,872\n\n(-80)*39 = -3,120\n\nSo, [ -1872 - (-3120) ] = -1872 + 3120 = 1248\n\nMultiply by (-9): -9*1248 = -11,232.\n\nSo, sum all three terms:\n\n-215,168 + 21,600 -11,232.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n-215,168 +21,600 = -193,568\n\n-193,568 -11,232 = -204,800\n\nSo, the determinant of minor(0,1) is -204,800.\n\nBut wait, the determinant of minor(0,1) is -204,800, but in the expansion, we have -det(minor(0,1)) which is -(-204,800) = 204,800.\n\nWait, no: the cofactor expansion for the determinant is:\n\ndet = (-1)^{0+1} * 1 * det(minor(0,1)) \n\n+ (-1)^{0+2} * 1 * det(minor(0,2)) \n\n- (-1)^{0+3} * 1 * det(minor(0,3)) \n\n+ (-1)^{0+4} * 1 * det(minor(0,4)).\n\nWait, no, the overall expansion is:\n\n- det(minor(0,1)) + det(minor(0,2)) - det(minor(0,3)) + det(minor(0,4)).\n\nSo, we computed det(minor(0,1)) as -204,800. So, the first term is -(-204,800) = +204,800.\n\nWait, no, wait: the expansion is:\n\n- det(minor(0,1)) + det(minor(0,2)) - det(minor(0,3)) + det(minor(0,4)).\n\nSo, the first term is - det(minor(0,1)).\n\nWe computed det(minor(0,1)) as -204,800.\n\nSo, - det(minor(0,1)) = -(-204,800) = +204,800.\n\nNow, I need to compute the other minors: det(minor(0,2)), det(minor(0,3)), det(minor(0,4)).\n\nThis will take a lot of time, but perhaps there's a pattern.

But let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, the expansion is:\n\n- det(minor(0,1)) + det(minor(0,2)) - det(minor(0,3)) + det(minor(0,4)).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- (-204,800) \u2192 +204,800\n\n+202,304\n\n- (-204,800) \u2192 +204,800\n\n+204,800\n\nSo, adding all together:\n\n204,800 +202,304 +204,800 +204,800.\n\nWhich is 204,800 *3 +202,304=614,400 +202,304=816,704.\n\nSo, determinant CM is 816,704.\n\nWait, but the CM determinant is supposed to be positive? Or can it be negative?\n\nWait, the determinant is 816,704.\n\nThen, the volume is sqrt( |CM| / 288 ).\n\nSo, Volume = sqrt(816,704 / 288 ).\n\nSimplify 816,704 /288.\n\nFirst, let's compute 816,704 \u00f7 16 =51,044.\n\n288 \u00f716=18.\n\nSo, 51,044 /18.\n\n51,044 \u00f7 2=25,522.\n\n18 \u00f72=9.\n\nSo, 25,522 /9 \u22482,835.777...\n\nWait, but let me see if 25,522 and 9 have any common factors. 25,522 \u00f72=12,761. 9 is 3\u00b2. 12,761 is likely a prime number.\n\nSo, 25,522 /9= (2 *12,761)/9=2/9 *12,761.\n\nSo, 816,704 /288= (816,704 \u00f716)/(288 \u00f716)=51,044 /18= (51,044 \u00f72)/(18 \u00f72)=25,522 /9.\n\nSo, Volume = sqrt(25,522 /9 )=sqrt(25,522)/3.\n\nWait, but 25,522=2*12,761. Let me check if 12,761 is a square.\n\nCompute sqrt(12,761)= around 113, since 113\u00b2=12,769. Close, but 113\u00b2=12,769, which is 8 more than 12,761. So, 12,761 is not a perfect square.\n\nSo, Volume = sqrt(25,522)/3= sqrt(2*12,761)/3.\n\nHmm, that seems messy. Did I make a mistake in computing the determinant?\n\nBecause the volume should be a rational multiple of sqrt(something). Maybe I made a computational error in calculating the determinant.\n\nWait, let me recheck the earlier steps. Computing the determinant for a 5x5 matrix is error-prone.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Since all faces are congruent triangles, maybe the volume can be computed using another method.\n\nEach face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. Let me compute the area of one face first.\n\nUsing Heron's formula:\n\ns = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2.\n\nBut that's complicated. Alternatively, use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nBut with a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(a + b + c)=\u221a41 +\u221a80 +\u221a89\n\n(-a + b + c)= -\u221a41 +\u221a80 +\u221a89\n\n(a - b + c)= \u221a41 -\u221a80 +\u221a89\n\n(a + b - c)= \u221a41 +\u221a80 -\u221a89\n\nBut this might not simplify easily.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4) )\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recall.\n\nActually, the formula is:\n\n16 Area\u00b2 = 2(a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2) - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4)\n\nSo, let me compute that.\n\nGiven a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nCompute a\u00b2=41, b\u00b2=80, c\u00b2=89.\n\nCompute 2(a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2)=2*(41*80 +80*89 +89*41)\n\nCompute each product:\n\n41*80=3,280\n\n80*89=7,120\n\n89*41=3,649\n\nSo, sum:3,280 +7,120=10,400 +3,649=14,049.\n\nMultiply by 2:28,098.\n\nNow, compute (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2 = (41 +80 +89)^2=(210)^2=44,100.\n\nCompute a^4 + b^4 + c^4=41\u00b2 +80\u00b2 +89\u00b2=1,681 +6,400 +7,921=15,  let's compute:\n\n41\u00b2=1,681\n\n80\u00b2=6,400\n\n89\u00b2=7,921\n\nSum:1,681 +6,400=8,081 +7,921=16,002.\n\nSo, 16 Area\u00b2=28,098 -16,002=12,096.\n\nThus, Area\u00b2=12,096 /16=756.\n\nSo, Area=\u221a756=\u221a(36*21)=6\u221a21.\n\nSo, each face has area 6\u221a21.\n\nNow, the total surface area is 4 *6\u221a21=24\u221a21.\n\nSo, the total surface area is 24\u221a21.\n\nNow, to find the inradius, we can use the formula:\n\ninradius = 3 * Volume / Surface Area.\n\nSo, I need to compute the Volume.\n\nWait, but earlier using the Cayley-Menger determinant, I got Volume = sqrt(816,704 /288 )= sqrt(25,522 /9 )= sqrt(25,522)/3.\n\nBut this seems messy, so perhaps I made a mistake in the CM determinant computation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume using another method.\n\nSince the tetrahedron is a disphenoid with all faces congruent, there's a formula for the volume in terms of the face areas and the dihedral angles, but that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for a disphenoid: Volume = (4/3) * sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) ) / 8.\n\nWait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps in a disphenoid, the volume can be computed as sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) ) / 72.\n\nWait, I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to use the formula I derived earlier.\n\nAlternatively, since all faces are congruent and have area 6\u221a21, perhaps I can find the volume another way.\n\nWait, another approach: In a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated if we know the edge lengths and the face areas.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron in terms of the face areas and the dihedral angles between the faces. But that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3) * Area^2 * (sqrt( something )) ?\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the tetrahedron as two congruent triangles hinged along an edge.\n\nWait, another idea: since all faces are congruent, perhaps the tetrahedron is isohedral, and the inradius can be related to the volume and the surface area.\n\nWait, but I still need the volume.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula for the volume of a disphenoid.\n\nUpon checking, the formula for the volume of a disphenoid is:\n\nVolume = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )) / 72.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about this formula. Let me think.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid, the volume can be computed using the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3) * sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) ) / 8.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me look for another way.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the volume using vectors.\n\nAssume that points A, B, C, D are positioned such that vectors AB, AC, AD are from point A.\n\nBut without knowing the exact coordinates, it's difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps assign coordinates in a way that the centroid is at the origin, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the formula that for a tetrahedron with congruent faces, the volume can be computed as sqrt( (Area^2 * 3\u221a3 ) / 16 ).\n\nWait, no, that's for a regular tetrahedron.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nWait, each face is a triangle with area 6\u221a21.\n\nIf I can find the height of the tetrahedron from a vertex to the opposite face, then Volume = (1/3)*base_area*height.\n\nBut without knowing the height, it's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the formula involving the inradius.\n\nWait, inradius = 3*Volume / SurfaceArea.\n\nBut since I don't know Volume, I can't compute inradius directly.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I can find the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant again, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.\n\nLet me try to compute the determinant again.\n\nWait, earlier I computed the determinant CM as 816,704, but perhaps I made an error in the cofactor expansion.\n\nWait, the determinant expansion was:\n\ndet = - det(minor(0,1)) + det(minor(0,2)) - det(minor(0,3)) + det(minor(0,4)).\n\nWhich was:\n\n204,800 +202,304 +204,800 +204,800.\n\nWait, that can't be, because when I computed det(minor(0,3)), I got -204,800, so - det(minor(0,3))=204,800.\n\nSimilarly, det(minor(0,4))=204,800.\n\nSo, adding all together:\n\n204,800 (from - det(minor(0,1)))\n\n+202,304 (from det(minor(0,2)))\n\n+204,800 (from - det(minor(0,3)))\n\n+204,800 (from det(minor(0,4)))\n\nTotal: 204,800 +202,304=407,104; 407,104 +204,800=611,904; 611,904 +204,800=816,704.\n\nSo, the determinant is 816,704.\n\nThen, Volume = sqrt(816,704 / 288).\n\nCompute 816,704 \u00f7288:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16: 816,704 \u00f716=51,044; 288 \u00f716=18.\n\nSo, 51,044 /18.\n\n51,044 \u00f72=25,522; 18 \u00f72=9.\n\nSo, 25,522 /9.\n\n25,522 \u00f79=2,835.777..., which is 2,835 and 7/9.\n\nBut that's not a perfect square. So, Volume = sqrt(25,522 /9 )=sqrt(25,522)/3.\n\nBut 25,522=2*12,761.\n\nWait, 12,761: let me check if it's a square.\n\nCompute 113\u00b2=12,769, which is larger than 12,761 by 8. So, 12,761 is not a perfect square.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the volume is sqrt(25,522)/3, which seems messy.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nWait, let me check the determinant again.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake in the sign during the cofactor expansion.\n\nWait, the determinant of the 5x5 matrix is:\n\nRow0:0,1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow2:1,41,0,89,80\n\nRow3:1,80,89,0,41\n\nRow4:1,89,80,41,0\n\nAnd I expanded along Row0, getting:\n\n- det(minor(0,1)) + det(minor(0,2)) - det(minor(0,3)) + det(minor(0,4)).\n\nBut perhaps the signs are incorrect.\n\nWait, the cofactor expansion alternates signs based on (-1)^(i+j). For Row0, the signs are:\n\nj=0: (-1)^(0+0)=1 \u2192 but since the first element is 0, it doesn't contribute.\n\nj=1: (-1)^(0+1)=-1\n\nj=2: (-1)^(0+2)=+1\n\nj=3: (-1)^(0+3)=-1\n\nj=4: (-1)^(0+4)=+1\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n0*... \n\n-1 * det(minor(0,1)) \n\n+1 * det(minor(0,2)) \n\n-1 * det(minor(0,3)) \n\n+1 * det(minor(0,4)).\n\nSo, it's:\n\n- det(minor(0,1)) + det(minor(0,2)) - det(minor(0,3)) + det(minor(0,4)).\n\nWhich is what I did.\n\nHmm. So, unless I made a mistake in calculating the minors, the determinant is 816,704.\n\nBut then, the volume would be sqrt(816,704 / 288 ).\n\nCompute 816,704 \u00f7288:\n\nLet me compute 288 * 2835 = 288 *2800=806,400; 288*35=10,080 \u2192 total 816,480.\n\nSo, 288 *2835=816,480.\n\nSubtract from 816,704: 816,704 -816,480=224.\n\nSo, 816,704=288*2835 +224.\n\n224=288*(224/288)=288*(7/9).\n\nSo, 816,704=288*(2835 +7/9)=288*(25,522/9).\n\nWait, because 2835=25,522/9? Wait, 2835 *9=25,515. Hmm, no.\n\nWait, 2835 *9=25,515. But 25,522 -25,515=7, so 25,522=2835*9 +7.\n\nSo, 816,704=288*(2835 +7/9)=288*(25,515 +7)/9=288*(25,522)/9.\n\nSo, 816,704 /288=25,522 /9.\n\nThus, Volume= sqrt(25,522 /9 )=sqrt(25,522)/3.\n\nHmm. Now, sqrt(25,522). Let's factor 25,522.\n\nDivide by 2:25,522=2*12,761.\n\n12,761: check divisibility.\n\nCheck if 12,761 is divisible by small primes:\n\nSum of digits:1+2+7+6+1=17, not divisible by 3.\n\n12,761 \u00f77=1,823 \u2192 7*1,823=12,761? 7*1,800=12,600; 7*23=161 \u2192 12,600+161=12,761. Yes!\n\nSo, 12,761=7*1,823.\n\nCheck if 1,823 is prime.\n\nCheck divisibility: 1,823 \u00f713=140.23\u2026 no.\n\n\u221a1,823\u224842.7. Test primes up to 43.\n\n1,823 \u00f717=107.235\u2026 no.\n\n1,823 \u00f719=95.947\u2026 no.\n\n1,823 \u00f723=79.26\u2026 no.\n\n1,823 \u00f729=62.86\u2026 no.\n\n1,823 \u00f731=58.8\u2026 no.\n\n1,823 \u00f737=49.27\u2026 no.\n\n1,823 \u00f741=44.46\u2026 no.\n\n1,823 \u00f743=42.395\u2026 no.\n\nSo, 1,823 is a prime number.\n\nThus, 25,522=2*7*1,823.\n\nSo, sqrt(25,522)=sqrt(2*7*1,823). Since 1,823 is prime, this cannot be simplified further.\n\nSo, Volume= sqrt(2*7*1,823)/3= sqrt(25,522)/3.\n\nHmm, that seems complicated. Perhaps I made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial edge lengths are incorrect in the CM determinant.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, AB=CD=\u221a41, AC=BD=\u221a80, BC=AD=\u221a89.\n\nSo, the edges are:\n\nAB=\u221a41,\n\nAC=\u221a80,\n\nAD=\u221a89,\n\nBC=\u221a89,\n\nBD=\u221a80,\n\nCD=\u221a41.\n\nSo, in the CM determinant, the edges are:\n\nAB^2=41,\n\nAC^2=80,\n\nAD^2=89,\n\nBC^2=89,\n\nBD^2=80,\n\nCD^2=41.\n\nSo, the matrix is correct as I set it up.\n\nSo, perhaps the determinant is correct.\n\nBut then, the volume is sqrt(25,522)/3, which is approximately sqrt(25,522)=159.76, so Volume\u2248159.76/3\u224853.25.\n\nBut I need an exact value.\n\nWait, but the inradius is 3*Volume / SurfaceArea.\n\nSurfaceArea=4*6\u221a21=24\u221a21.\n\nSo, inradius= 3*(sqrt(25,522)/3 ) / (24\u221a21 )= sqrt(25,522)/(24\u221a21 ).\n\nSimplify sqrt(25,522)/(24\u221a21 )= sqrt(25,522)/(24\u221a21 ).\n\nBut sqrt(25,522)=sqrt(2*7*1,823). Hmm, no way to simplify further.\n\nWait, but 25,522=2*7*1,823. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant approach, perhaps the sign is wrong.\n\nBecause if the determinant is negative, then the volume would be imaginary, which is impossible.\n\nWait, the determinant should be positive if the points are in a certain order.\n\nWait, perhaps the determinant is negative, so Volume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ).\n\nBut in my calculation, the determinant was positive. So, Volume is real.\n\nWait, maybe I need to accept that the volume is sqrt(25,522)/3.\n\nBut then, the inradius is sqrt(25,522)/(24\u221a21 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\nsqrt(25,522)/(24\u221a21 )= sqrt(25,522)/(24\u221a21 ).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):\n\n= sqrt(25,522)*sqrt(21)/(24*21 )\n\n= sqrt(25,522*21 )/(504 )\n\nCompute 25,522*21:\n\n25,522 *20=510,440\n\n25,522 *1=25,522\n\nTotal=510,440 +25,522=535,962.\n\nSo, sqrt(535,962)/504.\n\nFactor 535,962:\n\nDivide by 2:535,962=2*267,981.\n\n267,981: sum of digits=2+6+7+9+8+1=33, divisible by 3.\n\n267,981 \u00f73=89,327.\n\n89,327: check divisibility by 3:8+9+3+2+7=29, not divisible by 3.\n\nCheck divisibility by 7:89,327 \u00f77\u224812,761. 7*12,761=89,327.\n\nSo, 535,962=2*3*7*12,761.\n\nSo, sqrt(535,962)=sqrt(2*3*7*12,761).\n\nBut 12,761 is 7*1,823, as before.\n\nSo, sqrt(535,962)=sqrt(2*3*7^2 *1,823)=7*sqrt(2*3*1,823)=7*sqrt(10,938).\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nThis suggests that the inradius is 7*sqrt(10,938)/504= sqrt(10,938)/72.\n\nBut 10,938=2*3*1,823.\n\nSo, sqrt(10,938)=sqrt(2*3*1,823). No simplification.\n\nSo, inradius= sqrt(2*3*1,823)/72= sqrt(10,938)/72.\n\nBut 10,938=2*3*1,823.\n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant approach, and there's a simpler way.\n\nWait, another approach: Since all faces are congruent, maybe the tetrahedron is isohedral, and the inradius can be found using some properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the formula for inradius in terms of the volume and surface area.\n\nBut since I can't compute the volume easily, maybe I should find another way.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the inradius in a disphenoid.\n\nUpon checking, in a disphenoid, the inradius can be calculated if the edge lengths are known, but I can't recall the exact formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the inradius in terms of the volume and the surface area.\n\nWait, inradius=3V/S, where V is volume and S is surface area.\n\nI have S=24\u221a21.\n\nSo, if I can find V, I can find the inradius.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute V using another formula.\n\nWait, another idea: Since all faces are congruent, perhaps the tetrahedron is isohedral, and thus, the volume can be computed as (4/3) times the volume of one face times the inradius.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps using the formula V = (1/3) * S * r, where S is the total surface area, but no, that's for a pyramid with a single base.\n\nWait, no, the formula for a tetrahedron is V = (1/3) * base area * height.\n\nBut without knowing the height, it's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the formula that relates the inradius to the volume and surface area.\n\nYes, inradius r = 3V/S.\n\nSo, if I can find V, I can find r.\n\nBut to find V, perhaps I can use the formula for the volume of a disphenoid.\n\nUpon checking, the formula for the volume of a disphenoid is:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )) / 72.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me check the source.\n\nWait, upon checking, the formula for the volume of a disphenoid with edges a, b, c, a, b, c is:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )) / 72.\n\nBut in our case, the edges are AB=\u221a41, AC=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89, and the opposite edges are equal.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula applies.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nCompute (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)=41 +80 -89=32.\n\nCompute (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)=41 -80 +89=50.\n\nCompute (-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)= -41 +80 +89=128.\n\nSo, the product is 32*50*128.\n\nCompute 32*50=1,600.\n\n1,600*128=204,800.\n\nSo, V = sqrt(204,800)/72.\n\nsqrt(204,800)=sqrt(2048 *100)=10*sqrt(2048).\n\nsqrt(2048)=sqrt(1024*2)=32\u221a2.\n\nSo, sqrt(204,800)=10*32\u221a2=320\u221a2.\n\nThus, V=320\u221a2 /72= (320/72)*\u221a2= (40/9)*\u221a2.\n\nSimplify: 40/9 is already reduced.\n\nSo, V= (40\u221a2)/9.\n\nWait, that seems better.\n\nSo, Volume=40\u221a2/9.\n\nThen, SurfaceArea=24\u221a21.\n\nSo, inradius r=3V/S=3*(40\u221a2/9)/(24\u221a21 )= (120\u221a2/9)/(24\u221a21 )= (120\u221a2)/(9*24\u221a21 )= (120\u221a2)/(216\u221a21 ).\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\n120/216=5/9.\n\nSo, r= (5\u221a2)/(9\u221a21 ).\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21:\n\n= (5\u221a2 *\u221a21 )/(9*21 )\n\n=5\u221a42 / (189 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\u221a42 is already square-free.\n\nSo, r=5\u221a42 /189.\n\nBut 5 and 189 are coprime, and 42 is square-free.\n\nSo, the distance is 5\u221a42 /189.\n\nThus, m=5, n=42, p=189.\n\nBut wait, 189=9*21=9*3*7. So, 5 and 189 are coprime.\n\nBut 42 is square-free.\n\nSo, m +n +p=5+42+189=236.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the Volume calculation.\n\nUsing the disphenoid volume formula:\n\nV= sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 -c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 +c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) ) /72.\n\nPlugging in a\u00b2=41, b\u00b2=80, c\u00b2=89.\n\nSo, (41 +80 -89)=32,\n\n(41 -80 +89)=50,\n\n(-41 +80 +89)=128.\n\nProduct=32*50*128=204,800.\n\nsqrt(204,800)=sqrt(2048*100)=sqrt(2048)*10.\n\n2048=1024*2=32\u00b2*2. So, sqrt(2048)=32\u221a2.\n\nThus, sqrt(204,800)=32\u221a2 *10=320\u221a2.\n\nSo, V=320\u221a2 /72= (320/72)*\u221a2= (40/9)\u221a2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, Volume=40\u221a2/9.\n\nThen, SurfaceArea=4*6\u221a21=24\u221a21.\n\nThus, inradius r=3V/S=3*(40\u221a2/9)/(24\u221a21 )= (120\u221a2/9)/(24\u221a21 )= (120\u221a2)/(216\u221a21 )= (5\u221a2)/(9\u221a21 )=5\u221a42/(9*21 )=5\u221a42/189.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the distance is 5\u221a42/189.\n\nSimplify: 5 and 189 are coprime, 42 is square-free.\n\nThus, m=5, n=42, p=189.\n\nSo, m +n +p=5+42+189=236.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{236}\n\n\nGiven a tetrahedron \\(ABCD\\) with edges \\(AB = CD = \\sqrt{41}\\), \\(AC = BD = \\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(BC = AD = \\sqrt{89}\\), we need to find the distance from the incenter to each face. This distance can be written in the form \\(\\frac{m \\sqrt{n}}{p}\\), where \\(m\\), \\(n\\), and \\(p\\) are positive integers, \\(m\\) and \\(p\\) are relatively prime, and \\(n\\) is not divisible by the square of any prime. We then find \\(m + n + p\\).\n\nFirst, we recognize that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid with all faces congruent. Each face is a triangle with sides \\(\\sqrt{41}\\), \\(\\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{89}\\).\n\nWe calculate the area of one face using Heron's formula:\n- The semi-perimeter \\(s\\) is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{41} + \\sqrt{80} + \\sqrt{89}}{2}\\).\n- Using the formula for the area of a triangle, we find the area to be \\(6\\sqrt{21}\\).\n\nThe total surface area of the tetrahedron is \\(4 \\times 6\\sqrt{21} = 24\\sqrt{21}\\).\n\nNext, we use the formula for the volume of a disphenoid:\n- The volume \\(V\\) is given by \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 - b^2 + c^2)(-a^2 + b^2 + c^2)}}{72}\\), where \\(a^2 = 41\\), \\(b^2 = 80\\), and \\(c^2 = 89\\).\n- Calculating each term: \\(41 + 80 - 89 = 32\\), \\(41 - 80 + 89 = 50\\), and \\(-41 + 80 + 89 = 128\\).\n- The product is \\(32 \\times 50 \\times 128 = 204800\\).\n- The volume is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{204800}}{72} = \\frac{320\\sqrt{2}}{72} = \\frac{40\\sqrt{2}}{9}\\).\n\nUsing the formula for the inradius \\(r\\):\n- \\(r = \\frac{3V}{S}\\), where \\(V = \\frac{40\\sqrt{2}}{9}\\) and \\(S = 24\\sqrt{21}\\).\n- Substituting, we get \\(r = \\frac{3 \\times \\frac{40\\sqrt{2}}{9}}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{120\\sqrt{2}}{216\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{42}}{189}\\).\n\nThus, the distance is \\(\\frac{5\\sqrt{42}}{189}\\), and the values are \\(m = 5\\), \\(n = 42\\), and \\(p = 189\\). Therefore, \\(m + n + p = 5 + 42 + 189 = 236\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{236}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron problem. Let me try to parse it step by step. The tetrahedron is called ABCD. The edges are given as AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). So, all opposite edges are equal in pairs. That's interesting. I remember that in a tetrahedron, if opposite edges are equal, it might have some symmetry.\n\nThe problem says there's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the faces are all equal. That point must be the incenter of the tetrahedron, right? Like the 3D version of the incenter in a triangle. So, similar to how the inradius is found in a triangle, I need to find this distance for the tetrahedron.\n\nThe question is asking for the distance, which can be written as m sqrt(n)/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, I need to find m + n + p.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? I think I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and its surface area or something related to the areas of the faces. Because for the inradius in a tetrahedron, I remember the formula is 3 times the volume divided by the surface area. Wait, let me confirm that.\n\nYes, for a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius r is r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So, I need to compute both V and S.\n\nFirst, let me try to find the volume of the tetrahedron. Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron. I recall that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it's called an isosceles tetrahedron or a disphenoid. So, yes, this is a disphenoid.\n\nIn a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) )) / 72\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should think in terms of vectors or coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system where the coordinates are symmetric.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the vertices. Let me place point A at (x, y, z), point B at (-x, -y, z), point C at (-x, y, -z), and point D at (x, -y, -z). This setup often helps in making opposite edges equal.\n\nWait, why? Let me see. If I do that, then the edges AB, CD, AC, BD, etc., can be calculated using the distance formula.\n\nLet me compute AB: distance between A (x,y,z) and B (-x,-y,z).\n\nAB = sqrt( (x - (-x))^2 + (y - (-y))^2 + (z - z)^2 )\n= sqrt( (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 )\n= sqrt(4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2)\n= 2 sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nSimilarly, CD is the distance between C (-x,y,-z) and D (x,-y,-z):\n\nCD = sqrt( ( -x - x )\u00b2 + ( y - (-y) )\u00b2 + ( -z - (-z) )\u00b2 )\n= sqrt( (-2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 )\n= sqrt(4x\u00b2 +4y\u00b2)\n= 2 sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nWhich matches AB = CD = sqrt(41). So, 2 sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(41). Therefore, sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(41)/2. So, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute AC: distance between A (x,y,z) and C (-x,y,-z):\n\nAC = sqrt( (x - (-x))^2 + (y - y)^2 + (z - (-z))^2 )\n= sqrt( (2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2 )\n= sqrt(4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2)\n= 2 sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2)\n\nGiven AC = sqrt(80), so 2 sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80). Therefore, sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80)/2. So, x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 80/4 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, BD is the distance between B (-x,-y,z) and D (x,-y,-z):\n\nBD = sqrt( ( -x - x )^2 + ( -y - (-y) )^2 + (z - (-z))^2 )\n= sqrt( (-2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2 )\n= sqrt(4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2)\n= 2 sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80). So, same as AC.\n\nGood, so that's consistent.\n\nNow, compute BC: distance between B (-x,-y,z) and C (-x,y,-z):\n\nBC = sqrt( ( -x - (-x) )^2 + ( -y - y )^2 + ( z - (-z) )^2 )\n= sqrt( 0 + (-2y)^2 + (2z)^2 )\n= sqrt(4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2)\n= 2 sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)\n\nGiven BC = sqrt(89), so 2 sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89). Therefore, sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89)/2, so y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSimilarly, AD is the distance between A (x,y,z) and D (x,-y,-z):\n\nAD = sqrt( (x - x)^2 + (y - (-y))^2 + (z - (-z))^2 )\n= sqrt( 0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 )\n= sqrt(4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2)\n= 2 sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89). So, same as BC.\n\nSo, now, I have three equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n2. x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\n3. y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nI can solve these equations for x\u00b2, y\u00b2, z\u00b2.\n\nLet me write them:\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\nEquation 2: x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\nEquation 3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nLet me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\nEquation 2 - Equation 1: (x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4\nSimplify: z\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = (80/4 - 41/4) = 39/4\n\nSo, z\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 39/4. But from Equation 3, we have y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nNow, we can set up a system with z\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 39/4 and z\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nAdding both equations:\n\n2 z\u00b2 = (39 +89)/4 = 128/4 = 32\n\nSo, z\u00b2 = 16. Therefore, z = 4 or z = -4, but since it's squared, we'll take positive for simplicity, so z = 4.\n\nNow, from Equation 3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSince z\u00b2 =16, y\u00b2 = 89/4 -16 = 89/4 -64/4 =25/4. So, y =5/2 or y=-5/2.\n\nSimilarly, from Equation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =41/4. y\u00b2 is 25/4, so x\u00b2 =41/4 -25/4=16/4=4. So, x=2 or x=-2.\n\nSo, now, we have:\n\nx\u00b2=4 => x=2 or -2,\n\ny\u00b2=25/4 => y=5/2 or -5/2,\n\nz\u00b2=16 => z=4 or -4.\n\nBut in our coordinate system, I assigned A as (x,y,z), B as (-x,-y,z), C as (-x,y,-z), D as (x,-y,-z). So, let's pick x=2, y=5/2, z=4.\n\nSo, coordinates:\n\nA: (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB: (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC: (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nD: (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nLet me check if these coordinates satisfy all the distances.\n\nCompute AB: between (2,5/2,4) and (-2,-5/2,4):\n\nDifference in x: 4, y: 5, z:0.\n\nSo, sqrt(4\u00b2 +5\u00b2 +0\u00b2)=sqrt(16+25)=sqrt(41). Correct.\n\nCompute AC: between (2,5/2,4) and (-2,5/2,-4):\n\nx difference:4, y:0, z:8.\n\nsqrt(4\u00b2 +0 +8\u00b2)=sqrt(16+64)=sqrt(80). Correct.\n\nCompute BC: between (-2,-5/2,4) and (-2,5/2,-4):\n\nx:0, y:5, z:8.\n\nsqrt(0 +25 +64)=sqrt(89). Correct.\n\nAD: between (2,5/2,4) and (2,-5/2,-4):\n\nx:0, y:5, z:8.\n\nsqrt(0 +25 +64)=sqrt(89). Correct.\n\nSo, all the edges check out.\n\nNow, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with vertices at points A, B, C, D is |det(B - A, C - A, D - A)| / 6.\n\nLet me compute vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nWait, actually, vectors from A: AB, AC, AD.\n\nWait, no, more precisely, vectors from A to B, from A to C, from A to D.\n\nBut wait, actually, the vectors should be from the same point. So, to compute the volume, I can set A as the origin in a local coordinate system, but perhaps it's better to compute vectors AB, AC, AD and then take the scalar triple product.\n\nWait, actually, no. The vectors from A are AB, AC, AD, but in terms of position vectors, the vectors AB, AC, AD are the edges from A. But in reality, the vectors from A are (B - A), (C - A), (D - A). So, let me compute those.\n\nPoint A is (2,5/2,4).\n\nPoint B is (-2,-5/2,4). So, vector AB is B - A = (-2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, 4 -4) = (-4, -5, 0).\n\nPoint C is (-2,5/2,-4). Vector AC is C - A = (-2 -2,5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (-4, 0, -8).\n\nPoint D is (2,-5/2,-4). Vector AD is D - A = (2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8).\n\nSo, vectors:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nNow, the volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of AB, AC, AD divided by 6.\n\nThe scalar triple product is AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD).\n\nFirst, compute the cross product AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nLet me compute AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nCross product is:\n\n|i     j      k|\n|-4    0     -8|\n|0    -5     -8|\n\n= i*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni: 0*(-8) =0; (-8)*(-5)=40; so 0 -40 = -40. So, i*(-40)\n\nj: - [ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ] = - [32 - 0] = -32\n\nk: (-4)*(-5) =20; 0*0=0. So, 20 -0=20. So, k*20.\n\nSo, cross product AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nWait, cross product formula:\n\nFor vectors u = (u1, u2, u3) and v = (v1, v2, v3),\n\nu \u00d7 v = (u2v3 - u3v2, u3v1 - u1v3, u1v2 - u2v1)\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD:\n\nu = AC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nv = AD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nFirst component: u2v3 - u3v2 = 0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5) = 0 -40 = -40\n\nSecond component: u3v1 - u1v3 = (-8)*0 - (-4)*(-8) =0 -32 = -32\n\nThird component: u1v2 - u2v1 = (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 =20 -0=20\n\nSo yes, AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nNow, compute AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD)\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nDot product with (-40, -32, 20):\n\n= (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20\n\n= 160 + 160 + 0 = 320\n\nSo, the scalar triple product is 320. The volume is |320| / 6 = 320/6 = 160/3.\n\nSo, V = 160/3.\n\nNow, I need to compute the surface area S, which is the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces.\n\nSince the tetrahedron is symmetrical, perhaps all four faces are congruent? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, edges AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), BC = AD = sqrt(89). So, each face has edges of sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Wait, let me see.\n\nEach face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, all four faces are congruent triangles. So, each face has the same area. Therefore, if I compute the area of one face and multiply by four, I get the total surface area S.\n\nSo, compute the area of triangle ABC. Wait, but actually, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, I can compute the area using Heron's formula.\n\nLet me compute the semi-perimeter first.\n\ns = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2\n\nBut this might get messy. Alternatively, since I have coordinates for the points, I can compute the area using vectors or cross product.\n\nWait, for triangle ABC, with points A, B, C. So, vectors AB and AC can be used to compute the area.\n\nWait, but in my coordinate system, I have the coordinates of A, B, C, D. So, perhaps it's easier to compute the area of each face using the coordinates.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nCompute area of face ABC.\n\nPoints:\n\nA: (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB: (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC: (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nFirst, compute vectors AB and AC.\n\nWait, but in the face ABC, the vectors are AB and AC, but perhaps it's better to compute the vectors AB and BC and then compute the cross product.\n\nWait, no, to compute the area, I can use the formula: 1/2 |AB \u00d7 AC|.\n\nWait, but AB and AC are vectors from A, so AB = B - A, AC = C - A.\n\nWait, but the cross product of AB and AC gives a vector whose magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram spanned by AB and AC, so half of that is the area of triangle ABC.\n\nSo, let's compute AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nWait, AB is (-4, -5, 0), AC is (-4, 0, -8). Wait, no, I think I confused something.\n\nWait, AB is from A to B: B - A = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC is from A to C: C - A = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nSo, AB \u00d7 AC = |i    j     k|\n              |-4   -5     0|\n              |-4    0    -8|\n\n= i [ (-5)(-8) - 0*0 ] - j [ (-4)(-8) - 0*(-4) ] + k [ (-4)(0) - (-5)(-4) ]\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni: (-5)*(-8) - 0 =40 -0=40\n\nj: - [ (-4)*(-8) - 0 ] = - [32 -0 ] = -32\n\nk: (-4)*0 - (-5)*(-4) =0 -20= -20\n\nSo, AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\nFactor 3024: 3024 \u00f7 16 = 189. So, 16 * 189. 189 is 9*21 =9*3*7. So, 3024=16*9*3*7= (4\u00b2)*(3\u00b2)*3*7.\n\nSo, sqrt(3024) =4*3*sqrt(3*7)=12 sqrt(21)\n\nTherefore, |AB \u00d7 AC|=12 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21)=6 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, each face has area 6 sqrt(21). Since there are four faces, the total surface area S=4 *6 sqrt(21)=24 sqrt(21)\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be right. Because if each face is 6 sqrt(21), four faces would be 24 sqrt(21). But let me verify the cross product calculation again.\n\nWait, AB is (-4, -5, 0), AC is (-4,0,-8)\n\nAB \u00d7 AC = determinant:\n\ni  j  k\n-4 -5 0\n-4 0 -8\n\ni component: (-5)(-8) -0*0=40\nj component: - [ (-4)(-8) -0*(-4) ]= - [32 -0 ]= -32\nk component: (-4)(0) - (-5)(-4)=0 -20= -20\n\nSo, AB \u00d7 AC=(40, -32, -20). The magnitude squared is 40\u00b2 +32\u00b2 +20\u00b2=1600+1024+400=3024.\n\nYes, sqrt(3024)=sqrt(16*189)=4*sqrt(189)=4*sqrt(9*21)=4*3*sqrt(21)=12 sqrt(21). So, the magnitude is 12 sqrt(21). Then, area is half that, 6 sqrt(21). So, yes, each face has area 6 sqrt(21). So, four faces: 24 sqrt(21).\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think, the four faces are ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD. Are all four faces congruent?\n\nWait, in our coordinate system, all edges are equal in opposite pairs. So, perhaps all four faces are congruent triangles. So, yes, each face has the same area, so S=4 *6 sqrt(21)=24 sqrt(21).\n\nTherefore, the total surface area S=24 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, now, the inradius r = 3V / S.\n\nWait, V=160/3, S=24 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, r= 3*(160/3) / (24 sqrt(21)) )= (160) / (24 sqrt(21))= (20/3) / sqrt(21).\n\nWait, 160 divided by 24 is (160/24)= (20/3). So, r= (20/3)/sqrt(21)= (20)/(3 sqrt(21)).\n\nRationalizing the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):\n\nr= (20 sqrt(21))/(3 *21)= (20 sqrt(21))/63.\n\nSo, r= (20 sqrt(21))/63.\n\nCheck if 20 and 63 are coprime: 20=2\u00b2*5, 63=7*3\u00b2. No common factors. So, yes, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nBut wait, 21 is 3*7, which is square-free. So, that's okay.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nTherefore, m +n +p=20+21+63=104.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, in the cross product for AB \u00d7 AC, I got (40, -32, -20), which has magnitude 12 sqrt(21). So, area is 6 sqrt(21). So, each face is 6 sqrt(21), four faces gives 24 sqrt(21). Then, volume is 160/3.\n\nSo, r=3V/S= (3*(160/3))/ (24 sqrt(21)) )= (160)/(24 sqrt(21))= (20)/(3 sqrt(21))= (20 sqrt(21))/63.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the distance is 20 sqrt(21)/63, so m=20, n=21, p=63. Sum is 104.\n\nWait, but wait, I just thought: is the formula for inradius correct? I thought it was 3V/S, but let me confirm.\n\nIn a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius is indeed r = 3V / S, where S is the total surface area. Yes, that's correct. Because in a tetrahedron, the volume can be expressed as (1/3)*r*S, so V = (1/3)*r*S \u2192 r=3V/S.\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 20 +21 +63=104.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we first recognize that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid with opposite edges equal.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron problem. Let me try to parse it step by step. The tetrahedron is called ABCD. The edges are given as AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). So, all opposite edges are equal in pairs. That's interesting. I remember that in a tetrahedron, if opposite edges are equal, it might have some symmetry.\n\nThe problem says there's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the faces are all equal. That point must be the incenter of the tetrahedron, right? Like the 3D version of the incenter in a triangle. So, similar to how the inradius is found in a triangle, I need to find this distance for the tetrahedron.\n\nThe question is asking for the distance, which can be written as m sqrt(n)/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, I need to find m + n + p.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? I think I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and its surface area or something related to the areas of the faces. Because for the inradius in a tetrahedron, I remember the formula is 3 times the volume divided by the surface area. Wait, let me confirm that.\n\nYes, for a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius r is r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So, I need to compute both V and S.\n\nFirst, let me try to find the volume of the tetrahedron. Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron. I recall that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it's called an isosceles tetrahedron or a disphenoid. So, yes, this is a disphenoid.\n\nIn a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) )) / 72\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should think in terms of vectors or coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system where the coordinates are symmetric.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the vertices. Let me place point A at (x, y, z), point B at (-x, -y, z), point C at (-x, y, -z), and point D at (x, -y, -z). This setup often helps in making opposite edges equal.\n\nWait, why? Let me see. If I do that, then the edges AB, CD, AC, BD, etc., can be calculated using the distance formula.\n\nLet me compute AB: distance between A (x,y,z) and B (-x,-y,z).\n\nAB = sqrt( (x - (-x))^2 + (y - (-y))^2 + (z - z)^2 )\n= sqrt( (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 )\n= sqrt(4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2)\n= 2 sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nSimilarly, CD is the distance between C (-x,y,-z) and D (x,-y,-z):\n\nCD = sqrt( ( -x - x )\u00b2 + ( y - (-y) )\u00b2 + ( -z - (-z) )\u00b2 )\n= sqrt( (-2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 )\n= sqrt(4x\u00b2 +4y\u00b2)\n= 2 sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nWhich matches AB = CD = sqrt(41). So, 2 sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(41). Therefore, sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(41)/2. So, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute AC: distance between A (x,y,z) and C (-x,y,-z):\n\nAC = sqrt( (x - (-x))^2 + (y - y)^2 + (z - (-z))^2 )\n= sqrt( (2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2 )\n= sqrt(4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2)\n= 2 sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2)\n\nGiven AC = sqrt(80), so 2 sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80). Therefore, sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80)/2. So, x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 80/4 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, BD is the distance between B (-x,-y,z) and D (x,-y,-z):\n\nBD = sqrt( ( -x - x )^2 + ( -y - (-y) )^2 + (z - (-z))^2 )\n= sqrt( (-2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2 )\n= sqrt(4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2)\n= 2 sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80). So, same as AC.\n\nGood, so that's consistent.\n\nNow, compute BC: distance between B (-x,-y,z) and C (-x,y,-z):\n\nBC = sqrt( ( -x - (-x) )^2 + ( -y - y )^2 + ( z - (-z) )^2 )\n= sqrt( 0 + (-2y)^2 + (2z)^2 )\n= sqrt(4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2)\n= 2 sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)\n\nGiven BC = sqrt(89), so 2 sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89). Therefore, sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89)/2, so y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSimilarly, AD is the distance between A (x,y,z) and D (x,-y,-z):\n\nAD = sqrt( (x - x)^2 + (y - (-y))^2 + (z - (-z))^2 )\n= sqrt( 0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 )\n= sqrt(4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2)\n= 2 sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89). So, same as BC.\n\nSo, now, I have three equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n2. x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\n3. y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nI can solve these equations for x\u00b2, y\u00b2, z\u00b2.\n\nLet me write them:\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\nEquation 2: x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\nEquation 3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nLet me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\nEquation 2 - Equation 1: (x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4\nSimplify: z\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = (80/4 - 41/4) = 39/4\n\nSo, z\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 39/4. But from Equation 3, we have y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nNow, we can set up a system with z\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 39/4 and z\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nAdding both equations:\n\n2 z\u00b2 = (39 +89)/4 = 128/4 = 32\n\nSo, z\u00b2 = 16. Therefore, z = 4 or z = -4, but since it's squared, we'll take positive for simplicity, so z = 4.\n\nNow, from Equation 3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSince z\u00b2 =16, y\u00b2 = 89/4 -16 = 89/4 -64/4 =25/4. So, y =5/2 or y=-5/2.\n\nSimilarly, from Equation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =41/4. y\u00b2 is 25/4, so x\u00b2 =41/4 -25/4=16/4=4. So, x=2 or x=-2.\n\nSo, now, we have:\n\nx\u00b2=4 => x=2 or -2,\n\ny\u00b2=25/4 => y=5/2 or -5/2,\n\nz\u00b2=16 => z=4 or -4.\n\nBut in our coordinate system, I assigned A as (x,y,z), B as (-x,-y,z), C as (-x,y,-z), D as (x,-y,-z). So, let's pick x=2, y=5/2, z=4.\n\nSo, coordinates:\n\nA: (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB: (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC: (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nD: (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nLet me check if these coordinates satisfy all the distances.\n\nCompute AB: between (2,5/2,4) and (-2,-5/2,4):\n\nDifference in x: 4, y: 5, z:0.\n\nSo, sqrt(4\u00b2 +5\u00b2 +0\u00b2)=sqrt(16+25)=sqrt(41). Correct.\n\nCompute AC: between (2,5/2,4) and (-2,5/2,-4):\n\nx difference:4, y:0, z:8.\n\nsqrt(4\u00b2 +0 +8\u00b2)=sqrt(16+64)=sqrt(80). Correct.\n\nCompute BC: between (-2,-5/2,4) and (-2,5/2,-4):\n\nx:0, y:5, z:8.\n\nsqrt(0 +25 +64)=sqrt(89). Correct.\n\nAD: between (2,5/2,4) and (2,-5/2,-4):\n\nx:0, y:5, z:8.\n\nsqrt(0 +25 +64)=sqrt(89). Correct.\n\nSo, all the edges check out.\n\nNow, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with vertices at points A, B, C, D is |det(B - A, C - A, D - A)| / 6.\n\nLet me compute vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nWait, actually, vectors from A: AB, AC, AD.\n\nWait, no, more precisely, vectors from A to B, from A to C, from A to D.\n\nBut wait, actually, the vectors should be from the same point. So, to compute the volume, I can set A as the origin in a local coordinate system, but perhaps it's better to compute vectors AB, AC, AD and then take the scalar triple product.\n\nWait, actually, no. The vectors from A are AB, AC, AD, but in terms of position vectors, the vectors AB, AC, AD are the edges from A. But in reality, the vectors from A are (B - A), (C - A), (D - A). So, let me compute those.\n\nPoint A is (2,5/2,4).\n\nPoint B is (-2,-5/2,4). So, vector AB is B - A = (-2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, 4 -4) = (-4, -5, 0).\n\nPoint C is (-2,5/2,-4). Vector AC is C - A = (-2 -2,5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (-4, 0, -8).\n\nPoint D is (2,-5/2,-4). Vector AD is D - A = (2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8).\n\nSo, vectors:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nNow, the volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of AB, AC, AD divided by 6.\n\nThe scalar triple product is AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD).\n\nFirst, compute the cross product AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nLet me compute AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nCross product is:\n\n|i     j      k|\n|-4    0     -8|\n|0    -5     -8|\n\n= i*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni: 0*(-8) =0; (-8)*(-5)=40; so 0 -40 = -40. So, i*(-40)\n\nj: - [ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ] = - [32 - 0] = -32\n\nk: (-4)*(-5) =20; 0*0=0. So, 20 -0=20. So, k*20.\n\nSo, cross product AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nWait, cross product formula:\n\nFor vectors u = (u1, u2, u3) and v = (v1, v2, v3),\n\nu \u00d7 v = (u2v3 - u3v2, u3v1 - u1v3, u1v2 - u2v1)\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD:\n\nu = AC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nv = AD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nFirst component: u2v3 - u3v2 = 0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5) = 0 -40 = -40\n\nSecond component: u3v1 - u1v3 = (-8)*0 - (-4)*(-8) =0 -32 = -32\n\nThird component: u1v2 - u2v1 = (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 =20 -0=20\n\nSo yes, AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nNow, compute AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD)\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nDot product with (-40, -32, 20):\n\n= (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20\n\n= 160 + 160 + 0 = 320\n\nSo, the scalar triple product is 320. The volume is |320| / 6 = 320/6 = 160/3.\n\nSo, V = 160/3.\n\nNow, I need to compute the surface area S, which is the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces.\n\nSince the tetrahedron is symmetrical, perhaps all four faces are congruent? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, edges AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), BC = AD = sqrt(89). So, each face has edges of sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Wait, let me see.\n\nEach face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, all four faces are congruent triangles. So, each face has the same area. Therefore, if I compute the area of one face and multiply by four, I get the total surface area S.\n\nSo, compute the area of triangle ABC. Wait, but actually, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, I can compute the area using Heron's formula.\n\nLet me compute the semi-perimeter first.\n\ns = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2\n\nBut this might get messy. Alternatively, since I have coordinates for the points, I can compute the area using vectors or cross product.\n\nWait, for triangle ABC, with points A, B, C. So, vectors AB and AC can be used to compute the area.\n\nWait, but in my coordinate system, I have the coordinates of A, B, C, D. So, perhaps it's easier to compute the area of each face using the coordinates.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nCompute area of face ABC.\n\nPoints:\n\nA: (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB: (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC: (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nFirst, compute vectors AB and AC.\n\nWait, but in the face ABC, the vectors are AB and AC, but perhaps it's better to compute the vectors AB and BC and then compute the cross product.\n\nWait, no, to compute the area, I can use the formula: 1/2 |AB \u00d7 AC|.\n\nWait, but AB and AC are vectors from A, so AB = B - A, AC = C - A.\n\nWait, but the cross product of AB and AC gives a vector whose magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram spanned by AB and AC, so half of that is the area of triangle ABC.\n\nSo, let's compute AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nWait, AB is (-4, -5, 0), AC is (-4, 0, -8). Wait, no, I think I confused something.\n\nWait, AB is from A to B: B - A = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC is from A to C: C - A = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nSo, AB \u00d7 AC = |i    j     k|\n              |-4   -5     0|\n              |-4    0    -8|\n\n= i [ (-5)(-8) - 0*0 ] - j [ (-4)(-8) - 0*(-4) ] + k [ (-4)(0) - (-5)(-4) ]\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni: (-5)*(-8) - 0 =40 -0=40\n\nj: - [ (-4)*(-8) - 0 ] = - [32 -0 ] = -32\n\nk: (-4)*0 - (-5)*(-4) =0 -20= -20\n\nSo, AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\nFactor 3024: 3024 \u00f7 16 = 189. So, 16 * 189. 189 is 9*21 =9*3*7. So, 3024=16*9*3*7= (4\u00b2)*(3\u00b2)*3*7.\n\nSo, sqrt(3024) =4*3*sqrt(3*7)=12 sqrt(21)\n\nTherefore, |AB \u00d7 AC|=12 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21)=6 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, each face has area 6 sqrt(21). Since there are four faces, the total surface area S=4 *6 sqrt(21)=24 sqrt(21)\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be right. Because if each face is 6 sqrt(21), four faces would be 24 sqrt(21). But let me verify the cross product calculation again.\n\nWait, AB is (-4, -5, 0), AC is (-4,0,-8)\n\nAB \u00d7 AC = determinant:\n\ni  j  k\n-4 -5 0\n-4 0 -8\n\ni component: (-5)(-8) -0*0=40\nj component: - [ (-4)(-8) -0*(-4) ]= - [32 -0 ]= -32\nk component: (-4)(0) - (-5)(-4)=0 -20= -20\n\nSo, AB \u00d7 AC=(40, -32, -20). The magnitude squared is 40\u00b2 +32\u00b2 +20\u00b2=1600+1024+400=3024.\n\nYes, sqrt(3024)=sqrt(16*189)=4*sqrt(189)=4*sqrt(9*21)=4*3*sqrt(21)=12 sqrt(21). So, the magnitude is 12 sqrt(21). Then, area is half that, 6 sqrt(21). So, yes, each face has area 6 sqrt(21). So, four faces: 24 sqrt(21).\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think, the four faces are ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD. Are all four faces congruent?\n\nWait, in our coordinate system, all edges are equal in opposite pairs. So, perhaps all four faces are congruent triangles. So, yes, each face has the same area, so S=4 *6 sqrt(21)=24 sqrt(21).\n\nTherefore, the total surface area S=24 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, now, the inradius r = 3V / S.\n\nWait, V=160/3, S=24 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, r= 3*(160/3) / (24 sqrt(21)) )= (160) / (24 sqrt(21))= (20/3) / sqrt(21).\n\nWait, 160 divided by 24 is (160/24)= (20/3). So, r= (20/3)/sqrt(21)= (20)/(3 sqrt(21)).\n\nRationalizing the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):\n\nr= (20 sqrt(21))/(3 *21)= (20 sqrt(21))/63.\n\nSo, r= (20 sqrt(21))/63.\n\nCheck if 20 and 63 are coprime: 20=2\u00b2*5, 63=7*3\u00b2. No common factors. So, yes, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nBut wait, 21 is 3*7, which is square-free. So, that's okay.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nTherefore, m +n +p=20+21+63=104.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, in the cross product for AB \u00d7 AC, I got (40, -32, -20), which has magnitude 12 sqrt(21). So, area is 6 sqrt(21). So, each face is 6 sqrt(21), four faces gives 24 sqrt(21). Then, volume is 160/3.\n\nSo, r=3V/S= (3*(160/3))/ (24 sqrt(21)) )= (160)/(24 sqrt(21))= (20)/(3 sqrt(21))= (20 sqrt(21))/63.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the distance is 20 sqrt(21)/63, so m=20, n=21, p=63. Sum is 104.\n\nWait, but wait, I just thought: is the formula for inradius correct? I thought it was 3V/S, but let me confirm.\n\nIn a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius is indeed r = 3V / S, where S is the total surface area. Yes, that's correct. Because in a tetrahedron, the volume can be expressed as (1/3)*r*S, so V = (1/3)*r*S \u2192 r=3V/S.\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 20 +21 +63=104.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first recognize that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid with opposite edges equal. We assign coordinates to the vertices based on symmetry, resulting in points \\( A(2, 5/2, 4) \\), \\( B(-2, -5/2, 4) \\), \\( C(-2, 5/2, -4) \\), and \\( D(2, -5/2, -4) \\). \n\nWe calculate the volume \\( V \\) using the scalar triple product of vectors from point \\( A \\). The vectors are:\n- \\( \\overrightarrow{AB} = (-4, -5, 0) \\)\n- \\( \\overrightarrow{AC} = (-4, 0, -8) \\)\n- \\( \\overrightarrow{AD} = (0, -5, -8) \\)\n\nThe cross product \\( \\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD} \\) yields \\( (-40, -32, 20) \\). The dot product of \\( \\overrightarrow{AB} \\) with this result gives a scalar triple product of 320. Thus, the volume is \\( V = \\frac{320}{6} = \\frac{160}{3} \\).\n\nNext, we compute the total surface area \\( S \\). Each face is a triangle with sides \\( \\sqrt{41} \\), \\( \\sqrt{80} \\), and \\( \\sqrt{89} \\). Using the cross product of vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{AB} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{AC} \\), we find the area of one face to be \\( 6\\sqrt{21} \\). Since there are four congruent faces, the total surface area is \\( S = 4 \\times 6\\sqrt{21} = 24\\sqrt{21} \\).\n\nThe inradius \\( r \\) is given by \\( r = \\frac{3V}{S} \\). Substituting the values, we get:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{3 \\times \\frac{160}{3}}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{160}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20}{3\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}\n\\]\n\nThus, the distance is \\( \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63} \\), where \\( m = 20 \\), \\( n = 21 \\), and \\( p = 63 \\). Therefore, \\( m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{104}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron problem here, and I'm supposed to find the distance from the incenter to each face. The tetrahedron is labeled ABCD, and all the edges have specific lengths: AB and CD are sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). Interesting, so each pair of opposite edges are equal. That probably means the tetrahedron is isohedral or something? Wait, no, isohedral is when all faces are the same, which isn't necessarily the case here. Maybe it's just symmetric in some way.\n\nThe point I is the incenter, which means it's equidistant from all four faces. I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find the volume and the surface area of this tetrahedron.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize the tetrahedron. Since opposite edges are equal, maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron. Perhaps it's a disphenoid, which is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal and each pair of opposite edges are equal. I think that's exactly what this is. So, in a disphenoid, all faces are congruent triangles, but wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent. But in this case, the edges are AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So, if all the opposite edges are equal, but each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, each face has the same edge lengths, meaning all four faces are congruent triangles. So, it's a disphenoid with congruent faces. That should make calculations easier because all the faces are congruent, so their areas are equal, and the surface area is four times one face.\n\nSo, step one: compute the area of one face. Let's pick triangle ABC. The sides are AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), and AC = sqrt(80). Wait, no, AC is sqrt(80), which is given as AC = BD, etc. So, each face has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, all faces are congruent triangles with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, the area of each face is the same.\n\nSo, I can compute the area of one face, multiply by four to get the total surface area.\n\nTo compute the area of triangle ABC with sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89). I can use Heron's formula. First, compute the semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nCompute a + b + c: sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89). Hmm, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area using vectors or coordinates. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the area when three sides are known.\n\nWait, Heron's formula is straightforward. Let's compute s:\n\ns = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.\n\nBut that seems complicated because of the square roots. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps the triangle is right-angled? Let me check.\n\nCheck if a^2 + b^2 = c^2. Let's see:\n\na^2 = 41, b^2 = 80, c^2 = 89.\n\n41 + 80 = 121. 121 compared to c^2=89? No, 121 \u2260 89. So, not a right triangle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 41 + 89 = 130 vs. 80? 130 \u226080. Nope. So, not a right triangle. So, Heron's formula is the way to go.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can compute the area using vectors. If I can assign coordinates to the points, then I can compute vectors and use the cross product to find the area.\n\nLet me try that. Assigning coordinates to the tetrahedron. Since it's a disphenoid, maybe I can place it symmetrically.\n\nLet me think. Let's place point A at (x, y, z), B at (-x, -y, z), C at (-x, y, -z), and D at (x, -y, -z). This kind of symmetry often works for disphenoids. Let me check if this satisfies the given edge lengths.\n\nSo, compute AB, AC, AD, etc.\n\nCompute AB: distance between A (x,y,z) and B (-x,-y,z). The distance is sqrt[(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0^2] = sqrt(4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Given that AB = sqrt(41), so 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(41). So, sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(41)/2, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nSimilarly, compute AC: distance between A (x,y,z) and C (-x,y,-z). The distance is sqrt[(2x)^2 + 0^2 + (2z)^2] = sqrt(4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2). AC is given as sqrt(80), so 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80) => sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80)/2 => x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 80/4 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, compute AD: distance between A (x,y,z) and D (x,-y,-z). The distance is sqrt[0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2] = sqrt(4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). AD is sqrt(89), so 2*sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89) => sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89)/2 => y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo, now we have three equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n2. x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\n3. y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nLet me write them:\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n\nEquation 2: x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\n\nEquation 3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nI can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\n(Equation 2 - Equation 1): (x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4 => z\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = (80/4 - 41/4) = 39/4.\n\nSo, z\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 39/4.\n\nBut from Equation 3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\nz\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 39/4\n\nz\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nWe can add these two equations:\n\n(z\u00b2 - y\u00b2) + (z\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 39/4 + 89/4 => 2 z\u00b2 = 128/4 = 32 => z\u00b2 = 16 => z = 4 or z = -4.\n\nSo, z = 4. Let's take z =4 (since it's squared, the sign doesn't matter in distance).\n\nNow, plug z\u00b2 =16 into Equation 2: x\u00b2 +16 = 20 => x\u00b2 =4 => x=2 or x=-2.\n\nSimilarly, plug z\u00b2=16 into Equation 3: y\u00b2 +16=89/4 => y\u00b2=89/4 -16=89/4 -64/4=25/4 => y=5/2 or y=-5/2.\n\nSo, now we have x=2, y=5/2, z=4.\n\nSo, the coordinates are:\n\nA: (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB: (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC: (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nD: (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nWait, does this satisfy all the distances?\n\nCheck AB: distance between A(2,5/2,4) and B(-2,-5/2,4).\n\nDifference in x: 4, y: -5, z:0.\n\nDistance: sqrt(4\u00b2 +5\u00b2 +0) = sqrt(16+25)=sqrt(41). Correct.\n\nAC: distance between A(2,5/2,4) and C(-2,5/2,-4).\n\nDifferences: x: -4, y:0, z:-8.\n\nDistance: sqrt(16 + 0 +64)=sqrt(80). Correct.\n\nAD: distance between A(2,5/2,4) and D(2,-5/2,-4).\n\nDifferences: x:0, y:-5, z:-8.\n\nDistance: sqrt(0 +25 +64)=sqrt(89). Correct.\n\nGreat, so coordinates are correct.\n\nNow, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron. The formula for the volume given coordinates is |det(B - A, C - A, D - A)| /6.\n\nCompute vectors AB, AC, AD:\n\nWait, no, vectors from A: AB vector is B - A = (-2-2, -5/2 -5/2, 4-4) = (-4, -5, 0).\n\nAC vector is C - A = (-2-2, 5/2 -5/2, -4-4) = (-4, 0, -8).\n\nAD vector is D - A = (2-2, -5/2 -5/2, -4-4) = (0, -5, -8).\n\nSo, the three vectors from A are:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nTo compute the volume, I can take the scalar triple product of AB, AC, AD, and divide by 6.\n\nThe scalar triple product is AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD).\n\nFirst, compute AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nAC \u00d7 AD = |i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-4 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a0-8\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a0-5 \u00a0\u00a0-8\n\n= i*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni: 0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5) = 0 - 40 = -40\n\nj: - [ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ] = - [32 - 0] = -32\n\nk: (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 = 20\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nNow, compute AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD):\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nDot product: (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320.\n\nSo, the scalar triple product is 320.\n\nHence, the volume V = |320| /6 = 320/6 = 160/3.\n\nWait, that's the volume.\n\nNow, compute the surface area S. Since all four faces are congruent triangles with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), I can compute the area of one face and multiply by four.\n\nLet's compute the area of triangle ABC. Using Heron's formula.\n\nSides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nBut that's sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89) all over 2. That seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, since I have coordinates for the points, I can compute the area using vectors or the cross product.\n\nCompute vectors AB and AC, then compute half the magnitude of their cross product.\n\nWait, no, AB and AC are vectors from A, but triangle ABC is formed by points A, B, C. So, vectors AB and AC are from A, but perhaps I should use vectors AB and AC to compute the area.\n\nWait, area = (1/2)|AB \u00d7 AC|.\n\nCompute AB \u00d7 AC:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCompute cross product:\n\ni: (-5*(-8) - 0*0) = 40 -0 =40\n\nj: - [ (-4*(-8) - 0*(-4)) ] = - [32 -0] = -32\n\nk: (-4*0 - (-5)*(-4)) = 0 - 20 = -20\n\nSo, AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 +400) = sqrt(3024).\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024). Let's factor 3024:\n\n3024 \u00f7 16 = 189. So, sqrt(3024) = 4*sqrt(189).\n\n189 factors into 9*21 = 9*3*7. So, sqrt(189) = 3*sqrt(21).\n\nThus, sqrt(3024) =4*3*sqrt(21) =12 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21) =6 sqrt(21).\n\nTherefore, each face has area 6 sqrt(21), and the total surface area S =4 *6 sqrt(21) =24 sqrt(21).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check the cross product.\n\nWait, AB is (-4, -5, 0), AC is (-4, 0, -8).\n\nCross product:\n\ni component: (-5)(-8) - 0*0 =40\n\nj component: - [ (-4)(-8) - 0*(-4) ] = - [32 - 0] = -32\n\nk component: (-4)(0) - (-5)(-4) = 0 - 20 = -20\n\nSo, cross product is (40, -32, -20). The magnitude squared is 40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 = 1600 +1024 +400 =3024. So, magnitude is sqrt(3024). As before, sqrt(3024) = sqrt(16*189) =4*sqrt(189) =4*3*sqrt(21)=12 sqrt(21). So, the area is 6 sqrt(21). So, yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, total surface area S=24 sqrt(21).\n\nNow, the inradius r is 3V / S.\n\nWait, no, wait. The formula is r = 3V / S. Because for a tetrahedron, volume V = (1/3)*r*S, so rearranged, r= 3V/S.\n\nSo, compute 3V/S.\n\nGiven V=160/3, S=24 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, r=3*(160/3) / (24 sqrt(21)) =160 / (24 sqrt(21)).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n160 \u00f7 8 =20, 24 \u00f78=3. So, 20/(3 sqrt(21)).\n\nRationalize the denominator: 20 sqrt(21)/(3*21)=20 sqrt(21)/63.\n\nSo, r=20 sqrt(21)/63.\n\nWait, let me compute that step again.\n\n160 divided by 24 is (160/24) = (20/3). So, 20/3 divided by sqrt(21) is 20/(3 sqrt(21)). Then, rationalize: multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):\n\n20 sqrt(21) / (3*21)=20 sqrt(21)/63.\n\nSo, r=20 sqrt(21)/63.\n\nSimplify the fraction: 20 and 63 have a common factor? 20 factors are 2^2*5, 63 is 7*3^2. No common factors, so it's reduced.\n\nSo, the distance is 20 sqrt(21)/63.\n\nWait, the problem says it can be written as m sqrt(n)/p, where m and p are coprime, n square-free. So, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nBut wait, 20 and 63: GCD is 1, yes. 21 is square-free, as 21=3*7, no square factors.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63. Sum is 20+21+63=104.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recheck the steps.\n\nVolume: I computed it as 160/3, which seems correct. Surface area: 24 sqrt(21), correct. Then, inradius r=3V/S= 3*(160/3)/24 sqrt(21)=160/(24 sqrt(21))=20/(3 sqrt(21))=20 sqrt(21)/63.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, the answer is 20 sqrt(21)/63, so m=20, n=21, p=63. Sum is 20+21+63=104.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{104}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron problem here, and I'm supposed to find the distance from the incenter to each face. The tetrahedron is labeled ABCD, and all the edges have specific lengths: AB and CD are sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). Interesting, so each pair of opposite edges are equal. That probably means the tetrahedron is isohedral or something? Wait, no, isohedral is when all faces are the same, which isn't necessarily the case here. Maybe it's just symmetric in some way.\n\nThe point I is the incenter, which means it's equidistant from all four faces. I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find the volume and the surface area of this tetrahedron.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize the tetrahedron. Since opposite edges are equal, maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron. Perhaps it's a disphenoid, which is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal and each pair of opposite edges are equal. I think that's exactly what this is. So, in a disphenoid, all faces are congruent triangles, but wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent. But in this case, the edges are AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So, if all the opposite edges are equal, but each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, each face has the same edge lengths, meaning all four faces are congruent triangles. So, it's a disphenoid with congruent faces. That should make calculations easier because all the faces are congruent, so their areas are equal, and the surface area is four times one face.\n\nSo, step one: compute the area of one face. Let's pick triangle ABC. The sides are AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), and AC = sqrt(80). Wait, no, AC is sqrt(80), which is given as AC = BD, etc. So, each face has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, all faces are congruent triangles with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, the area of each face is the same.\n\nSo, I can compute the area of one face, multiply by four to get the total surface area.\n\nTo compute the area of triangle ABC with sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89). I can use Heron's formula. First, compute the semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nCompute a + b + c: sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89). Hmm, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area using vectors or coordinates. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the area when three sides are known.\n\nWait, Heron's formula is straightforward. Let's compute s:\n\ns = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.\n\nBut that seems complicated because of the square roots. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps the triangle is right-angled? Let me check.\n\nCheck if a^2 + b^2 = c^2. Let's see:\n\na^2 = 41, b^2 = 80, c^2 = 89.\n\n41 + 80 = 121. 121 compared to c^2=89? No, 121 \u2260 89. So, not a right triangle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 41 + 89 = 130 vs. 80? 130 \u226080. Nope. So, not a right triangle. So, Heron's formula is the way to go.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can compute the area using vectors. If I can assign coordinates to the points, then I can compute vectors and use the cross product to find the area.\n\nLet me try that. Assigning coordinates to the tetrahedron. Since it's a disphenoid, maybe I can place it symmetrically.\n\nLet me think. Let's place point A at (x, y, z), B at (-x, -y, z), C at (-x, y, -z), and D at (x, -y, -z). This kind of symmetry often works for disphenoids. Let me check if this satisfies the given edge lengths.\n\nSo, compute AB, AC, AD, etc.\n\nCompute AB: distance between A (x,y,z) and B (-x,-y,z). The distance is sqrt[(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0^2] = sqrt(4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Given that AB = sqrt(41), so 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(41). So, sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(41)/2, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nSimilarly, compute AC: distance between A (x,y,z) and C (-x,y,-z). The distance is sqrt[(2x)^2 + 0^2 + (2z)^2] = sqrt(4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2). AC is given as sqrt(80), so 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80) => sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80)/2 => x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 80/4 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, compute AD: distance between A (x,y,z) and D (x,-y,-z). The distance is sqrt[0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2] = sqrt(4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). AD is sqrt(89), so 2*sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89) => sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89)/2 => y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo, now we have three equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n2. x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\n3. y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nLet me write them:\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n\nEquation 2: x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\n\nEquation 3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nI can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\n(Equation 2 - Equation 1): (x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4 => z\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = (80/4 - 41/4) = 39/4.\n\nSo, z\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 39/4.\n\nBut from Equation 3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\nz\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 39/4\n\nz\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nWe can add these two equations:\n\n(z\u00b2 - y\u00b2) + (z\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 39/4 + 89/4 => 2 z\u00b2 = 128/4 = 32 => z\u00b2 = 16 => z = 4 or z = -4.\n\nSo, z = 4. Let's take z =4 (since it's squared, the sign doesn't matter in distance).\n\nNow, plug z\u00b2 =16 into Equation 2: x\u00b2 +16 = 20 => x\u00b2 =4 => x=2 or x=-2.\n\nSimilarly, plug z\u00b2=16 into Equation 3: y\u00b2 +16=89/4 => y\u00b2=89/4 -16=89/4 -64/4=25/4 => y=5/2 or y=-5/2.\n\nSo, now we have x=2, y=5/2, z=4.\n\nSo, the coordinates are:\n\nA: (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB: (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC: (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nD: (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nWait, does this satisfy all the distances?\n\nCheck AB: distance between A(2,5/2,4) and B(-2,-5/2,4).\n\nDifference in x: 4, y: -5, z:0.\n\nDistance: sqrt(4\u00b2 +5\u00b2 +0) = sqrt(16+25)=sqrt(41). Correct.\n\nAC: distance between A(2,5/2,4) and C(-2,5/2,-4).\n\nDifferences: x: -4, y:0, z:-8.\n\nDistance: sqrt(16 + 0 +64)=sqrt(80). Correct.\n\nAD: distance between A(2,5/2,4) and D(2,-5/2,-4).\n\nDifferences: x:0, y:-5, z:-8.\n\nDistance: sqrt(0 +25 +64)=sqrt(89). Correct.\n\nGreat, so coordinates are correct.\n\nNow, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron. The formula for the volume given coordinates is |det(B - A, C - A, D - A)| /6.\n\nCompute vectors AB, AC, AD:\n\nWait, no, vectors from A: AB vector is B - A = (-2-2, -5/2 -5/2, 4-4) = (-4, -5, 0).\n\nAC vector is C - A = (-2-2, 5/2 -5/2, -4-4) = (-4, 0, -8).\n\nAD vector is D - A = (2-2, -5/2 -5/2, -4-4) = (0, -5, -8).\n\nSo, the three vectors from A are:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nTo compute the volume, I can take the scalar triple product of AB, AC, AD, and divide by 6.\n\nThe scalar triple product is AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD).\n\nFirst, compute AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nAC \u00d7 AD = |i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-4 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a0-8\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a0-5 \u00a0\u00a0-8\n\n= i*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni: 0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5) = 0 - 40 = -40\n\nj: - [ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ] = - [32 - 0] = -32\n\nk: (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 = 20\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nNow, compute AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD):\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nDot product: (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320.\n\nSo, the scalar triple product is 320.\n\nHence, the volume V = |320| /6 = 320/6 = 160/3.\n\nWait, that's the volume.\n\nNow, compute the surface area S. Since all four faces are congruent triangles with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), I can compute the area of one face and multiply by four.\n\nLet's compute the area of triangle ABC. Using Heron's formula.\n\nSides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nBut that's sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89) all over 2. That seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, since I have coordinates for the points, I can compute the area using vectors or the cross product.\n\nCompute vectors AB and AC, then compute half the magnitude of their cross product.\n\nWait, no, AB and AC are vectors from A, but triangle ABC is formed by points A, B, C. So, vectors AB and AC are from A, but perhaps I should use vectors AB and AC to compute the area.\n\nWait, area = (1/2)|AB \u00d7 AC|.\n\nCompute AB \u00d7 AC:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCompute cross product:\n\ni: (-5*(-8) - 0*0) = 40 -0 =40\n\nj: - [ (-4*(-8) - 0*(-4)) ] = - [32 -0] = -32\n\nk: (-4*0 - (-5)*(-4)) = 0 - 20 = -20\n\nSo, AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 +400) = sqrt(3024).\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024). Let's factor 3024:\n\n3024 \u00f7 16 = 189. So, sqrt(3024) = 4*sqrt(189).\n\n189 factors into 9*21 = 9*3*7. So, sqrt(189) = 3*sqrt(21).\n\nThus, sqrt(3024) =4*3*sqrt(21) =12 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21) =6 sqrt(21).\n\nTherefore, each face has area 6 sqrt(21), and the total surface area S =4 *6 sqrt(21) =24 sqrt(21).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check the cross product.\n\nWait, AB is (-4, -5, 0), AC is (-4, 0, -8).\n\nCross product:\n\ni component: (-5)(-8) - 0*0 =40\n\nj component: - [ (-4)(-8) - 0*(-4) ] = - [32 - 0] = -32\n\nk component: (-4)(0) - (-5)(-4) = 0 - 20 = -20\n\nSo, cross product is (40, -32, -20). The magnitude squared is 40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 = 1600 +1024 +400 =3024. So, magnitude is sqrt(3024). As before, sqrt(3024) = sqrt(16*189) =4*sqrt(189) =4*3*sqrt(21)=12 sqrt(21). So, the area is 6 sqrt(21). So, yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, total surface area S=24 sqrt(21).\n\nNow, the inradius r is 3V / S.\n\nWait, no, wait. The formula is r = 3V / S. Because for a tetrahedron, volume V = (1/3)*r*S, so rearranged, r= 3V/S.\n\nSo, compute 3V/S.\n\nGiven V=160/3, S=24 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, r=3*(160/3) / (24 sqrt(21)) =160 / (24 sqrt(21)).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n160 \u00f7 8 =20, 24 \u00f78=3. So, 20/(3 sqrt(21)).\n\nRationalize the denominator: 20 sqrt(21)/(3*21)=20 sqrt(21)/63.\n\nSo, r=20 sqrt(21)/63.\n\nWait, let me compute that step again.\n\n160 divided by 24 is (160/24) = (20/3). So, 20/3 divided by sqrt(21) is 20/(3 sqrt(21)). Then, rationalize: multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):\n\n20 sqrt(21) / (3*21)=20 sqrt(21)/63.\n\nSo, r=20 sqrt(21)/63.\n\nSimplify the fraction: 20 and 63 have a common factor? 20 factors are 2^2*5, 63 is 7*3^2. No common factors, so it's reduced.\n\nSo, the distance is 20 sqrt(21)/63.\n\nWait, the problem says it can be written as m sqrt(n)/p, where m and p are coprime, n square-free. So, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nBut wait, 20 and 63: GCD is 1, yes. 21 is square-free, as 21=3*7, no square factors.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63. Sum is 20+21+63=104.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recheck the steps.\n\nVolume: I computed it as 160/3, which seems correct. Surface area: 24 sqrt(21), correct. Then, inradius r=3V/S= 3*(160/3)/24 sqrt(21)=160/(24 sqrt(21))=20/(3 sqrt(21))=20 sqrt(21)/63.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, the answer is 20 sqrt(21)/63, so m=20, n=21, p=63. Sum is 20+21+63=104.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{104}\n\n\nGiven a tetrahedron \\(ABCD\\) with edges \\(AB = CD = \\sqrt{41}\\), \\(AC = BD = \\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(BC = AD = \\sqrt{89}\\), we need to find the distance from the incenter \\(I\\) to each face. This distance can be written in the form \\(\\frac{m \\sqrt{n}}{p}\\), where \\(m\\), \\(n\\), and \\(p\\) are positive integers, \\(m\\) and \\(p\\) are relatively prime, and \\(n\\) is not divisible by the square of any prime. We then find \\(m + n + p\\).\n\nFirst, we recognize that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid with congruent faces. Each face is a triangle with sides \\(\\sqrt{41}\\), \\(\\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{89}\\).\n\nTo find the volume \\(V\\) of the tetrahedron, we use coordinates assigned to the vertices. The coordinates are:\n- \\(A(2, \\frac{5}{2}, 4)\\)\n- \\(B(-2, -\\frac{5}{2}, 4)\\)\n- \\(C(-2, \\frac{5}{2}, -4)\\)\n- \\(D(2, -\\frac{5}{2}, -4)\\)\n\nUsing the scalar triple product of vectors from point \\(A\\), we compute the volume:\n- Vectors: \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} = (-4, -5, 0)\\), \\(\\overrightarrow{AC} = (-4, 0, -8)\\), \\(\\overrightarrow{AD} = (0, -5, -8)\\)\n- Cross product \\(\\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD} = (-40, -32, 20)\\)\n- Dot product \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} \\cdot (\\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD}) = 320\\)\n- Volume \\(V = \\frac{320}{6} = \\frac{160}{3}\\)\n\nNext, we compute the surface area \\(S\\). Each face is a triangle with area calculated using the cross product:\n- Cross product \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} \\times \\overrightarrow{AC} = (40, -32, -20)\\)\n- Magnitude of the cross product: \\(\\sqrt{3024} = 12\\sqrt{21}\\)\n- Area of one face: \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 12\\sqrt{21} = 6\\sqrt{21}\\)\n- Total surface area \\(S = 4 \\times 6\\sqrt{21} = 24\\sqrt{21}\\)\n\nThe inradius \\(r\\) is given by \\(r = \\frac{3V}{S}\\):\n- \\(r = \\frac{3 \\times \\frac{160}{3}}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{160}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}\\)\n\nThus, the distance is \\(\\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}\\), where \\(m = 20\\), \\(n = 21\\), and \\(p = 63\\). Therefore, \\(m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{104}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD, and all the opposite edges are equal. That is, AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). I need to find the distance from the incenter I to each face, which is the same for all faces. The answer should be in the form m\u221an / p, and then find m + n + p.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula: inradius r = 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area.\n\nSo, I need to find both the volume and the surface area of this tetrahedron.\n\nBut wait, calculating the surface area might be tricky because each face is a triangle, and I don't know their areas yet. Maybe I can find the areas of the faces using Heron's formula, but for that, I need to know the lengths of all edges of each face.\n\nWait, but the problem gives me the lengths of opposite edges. Let me list all the edges:\n\nAB = sqrt(41)\nBC = sqrt(89)\nCD = sqrt(41)\nDA = sqrt(89)\n\nAC = sqrt(80)\nBD = sqrt(80)\n\nSo, each face is a triangle with sides from these lengths. Let me figure out what each face looks like.\n\nFaces:\n1. ABC: edges AB, BC, AC\n2. ABD: edges AB, BD, AD\n3. ACD: edges AC, CD, AD\n4. BCD: edges BC, CD, BD\n\nWait, so each face has two edges of one length and one edge of another. For example, face ABC has AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), and AC = sqrt(80). Similarly, face ABD has AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), and AD = sqrt(89). Same with the others. So each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89).\n\nWait a second, so all four faces are congruent triangles? Because each face has sides of sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, all faces are congruent. That might simplify things because then each face has the same area.\n\nSo, if I can compute the area of one face, I can multiply it by four to get the total surface area S.\n\nLet me compute the area of one face, say triangle ABC with sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nUsing Heron's formula: the area is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nFirst, compute s: (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.\n\nHmm, but that seems messy. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, maybe I can check if the triangle is right-angled. Let me see: does (sqrt(41))^2 + (sqrt(80))^2 equal (sqrt(89))^2?\n\nCompute 41 + 80 = 121, and sqrt(89)^2 is 89. 121 \u2260 89, so not right-angled. What about other combinations? Let's check all possibilities.\n\nWait, 41 + 89 = 130, which is not 80. 80 + 89 = 169, which is 13^2, but 41 is not equal to 169. So, no, it's not right-angled.\n\nHmm, so maybe Heron's formula is the way to go. But the square roots might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can use vectors or coordinates to find the volume and areas.\n\nWait, perhaps placing the tetrahedron in coordinate space could help. Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron.\n\nLet me think: if I can assign coordinates to the vertices such that the opposite edges are equal, that might help compute the volume and other properties.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the vertices. Let me suppose that point A is at (x, y, z), B at (a, b, c), C at (d, e, f), D at (g, h, i). But that might be too many variables. Alternatively, maybe I can use symmetry.\n\nWait, I remember that in a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, it's called an isosceles tetrahedron, and it has some properties, like having all face areas equal, and having a centroid that coincides with the incenter and circumcenter.\n\nWait, so if all faces are congruent, then their areas are equal, so the inradius can be found by 3V / S, where S is 4 times the area of one face.\n\nBut then, I need to compute V, the volume.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nYes, the Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:\n\nVolume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the matrix:\n\n0 1 1 1 1\n\n1 0 a\u00b2 b\u00b2 c\u00b2\n\n1 a\u00b2 0 d\u00b2 e\u00b2\n\n1 b\u00b2 d\u00b2 0 f\u00b2\n\n1 c\u00b2 e\u00b2 f\u00b2 0\n\nSo, let me assign the given edge lengths:\n\nAB = sqrt(41) => AB\u00b2 = 41\n\nAC = sqrt(80) => AC\u00b2 = 80\n\nAD = sqrt(89) => AD\u00b2 = 89\n\nBC = sqrt(89) => BC\u00b2 = 89\n\nBD = sqrt(80) => BD\u00b2 = 80\n\nCD = sqrt(41) => CD\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo, the Cayley-Menger determinant matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nThe matrix is 5x5, with the first row and column being [0,1,1,1,1] and [0,1,1,1,1]^T.\n\nThen, the (1,2) entry is AB\u00b2 = 41, (1,3)=AC\u00b2=80, (1,4)=AD\u00b2=89.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1)=AB\u00b2=41, (2,3)=BC\u00b2=89, (2,4)=BD\u00b2=80.\n\n(3,1)=AC\u00b2=80, (3,2)=BC\u00b2=89, (3,4)=CD\u00b2=41.\n\n(4,1)=AD\u00b2=89, (4,2)=BD\u00b2=80, (4,3)=CD\u00b2=41.\n\nSo the Cayley-Menger determinant matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 1 1 1\n\nRow 1: 1 0 41 80 89\n\nRow 2: 1 41 0 89 80\n\nRow 3: 1 80 89 0 41\n\nRow 4: 1 89 80 41 0\n\nNow, I need to compute the determinant of this matrix. But 5x5 determinants are a bit complicated. Maybe I can use some symmetry or properties to simplify it.\n\nWait, I notice that the matrix is symmetric except for the first row and column. Maybe we can perform some row or column operations to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize that the tetrahedron is isohedral, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the determinant step by step.\n\nBut computing a 5x5 determinant manually is time-consuming. Maybe I can expand along the first row.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n0 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor)\n\nBut the first term is zero, so it's:\n\n-1 * det(M1) + 1 * det(M2) - 1 * det(M3) + 1 * det(M4)\n\nWhere M1 is the minor for element (0,1), M2 for (0,2), etc.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the determinant is zero if the points are coplanar, but in this case, it's a tetrahedron, so the determinant should be non-zero.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a smarter way. Maybe I can note that the given tetrahedron is such that all opposite edges are equal, which makes it a disphenoid. And for a disphenoid, there's a formula for the volume.\n\nI recall that in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) ) / 8\n\nWait, no, perhaps that's for a different kind of tetrahedron. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the volume using the formula for a disphenoid.\n\nWait, a disphenoid has four congruent triangular faces. Wait, in our case, all four faces are congruent, as each face has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So yes, it's a regular disphenoid.\n\nIn a regular disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )) / 72\n\nWait, I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the volume of a disphenoid in terms of its edges.\n\nWait, another approach: since all four faces are congruent, perhaps the tetrahedron is isohedral, and there might be a formula for its volume in terms of the edge lengths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant as I initially thought, despite the complexity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assign coordinates to the vertices in a symmetric way.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me place the tetrahedron such that the midpoints of opposite edges coincide at the origin. Since opposite edges are equal, this might help.\n\nLet me denote the midpoints of AB and CD as M, and the midpoints of AC and BD as N, and the midpoints of AD and BC as P.\n\nBut since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps the centroid is at the origin.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can assign coordinates such that the centroid is at (0,0,0), and the vertices are symmetric.\n\nWait, perhaps I can let points A, B, C, D have coordinates such that:\n\nA = (x, y, z)\n\nB = (-x, -y, -z)\n\nC = (a, b, c)\n\nD = (-a, -b, -c)\n\nBecause in this way, the midpoints of AB and CD are both at the origin, and similarly for other pairs.\n\nBut wait, let me think: if AB and CD are opposite edges, then the midpoints of AB and CD should coincide if the tetrahedron is symmetric.\n\nWait, maybe I can set the coordinates as follows:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nA = (p, q, r)\n\nB = (-p, -q, -r)\n\nC = (s, t, u)\n\nD = (-s, -t, -u)\n\nIn this case, the midpoints of AB and CD are both (0,0,0).\n\nThen, the edges AB and CD both have length sqrt( (2p)^2 + (2q)^2 + (2r)^2 ) = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2). Similarly, edges AC and BD would have lengths sqrt( (p + s)^2 + (q + t)^2 + (r + u)^2 ), and edges AD and BC would have lengths sqrt( (p - s)^2 + (q - t)^2 + (r - u)^2 ).\n\nWait, but in the problem, AB = CD = sqrt(41), so 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) = sqrt(41) => sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) = sqrt(41)/2.\n\nSimilarly, AC = BD = sqrt(80). Let me compute AC: the distance between A = (p,q,r) and C = (s,t,u) is sqrt( (p - s)^2 + (q - t)^2 + (r - u)^2 ) = sqrt(80). Similarly, BD is the distance between B = (-p,-q,-r) and D = (-s,-t,-u), which is sqrt( ( -p + s )^2 + ( -q + t )^2 + ( -r + u )^2 ) = sqrt( (s - p)^2 + (t - q)^2 + (u - r)^2 ) = same as AC, which is sqrt(80).\n\nSimilarly, AD = BC = sqrt(89). AD is the distance between A = (p,q,r) and D = (-s,-t,-u): sqrt( (p + s)^2 + (q + t)^2 + (r + u)^2 ). BC is the distance between B = (-p,-q,-r) and C = (s,t,u): sqrt( (s + p)^2 + (t + q)^2 + (u + r)^2 ), which is the same as AD.\n\nSo, the conditions are:\n\n1. AB = sqrt(41) => 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) = sqrt(41) => sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) = sqrt(41)/2.\n\n2. AC = sqrt(80) => sqrt( (p - s)^2 + (q - t)^2 + (r - u)^2 ) = sqrt(80).\n\n3. AD = sqrt(89) => sqrt( (p + s)^2 + (q + t)^2 + (r + u)^2 ) = sqrt(89).\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\nEquation 1: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = (sqrt(41)/2)^2 = 41/4.\n\nEquation 2: (p - s)^2 + (q - t)^2 + (r - u)^2 = 80.\n\nEquation 3: (p + s)^2 + (q + t)^2 + (r + u)^2 = 89.\n\nLet me expand Equations 2 and 3.\n\nEquation 2 expanded:\n\np\u00b2 - 2ps + s\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qt + t\u00b2 + r\u00b2 - 2ru + u\u00b2 = 80.\n\nEquation 3 expanded:\n\np\u00b2 + 2ps + s\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qt + t\u00b2 + r\u00b2 + 2ru + u\u00b2 = 89.\n\nNow, let me add Equation 2 and Equation 3:\n\n( p\u00b2 - 2ps + s\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qt + t\u00b2 + r\u00b2 - 2ru + u\u00b2 ) + ( p\u00b2 + 2ps + s\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qt + t\u00b2 + r\u00b2 + 2ru + u\u00b2 ) = 80 + 89.\n\nSimplify:\n\n2p\u00b2 + 2s\u00b2 + 2q\u00b2 + 2t\u00b2 + 2r\u00b2 + 2u\u00b2 = 169.\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\np\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + r\u00b2 + u\u00b2 = 169/2.\n\nBut from Equation 1, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 41/4. So, substituting that into the above:\n\n41/4 + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + u\u00b2 = 169/2.\n\nSubtract 41/4: s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + u\u00b2 = 169/2 - 41/4 = (338 - 41)/4 = 297/4.\n\nSo, s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + u\u00b2 = 297/4.\n\nNow, let's subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3:\n\n( p\u00b2 + 2ps + s\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qt + t\u00b2 + r\u00b2 + 2ru + u\u00b2 ) - ( p\u00b2 - 2ps + s\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qt + t\u00b2 + r\u00b2 - 2ru + u\u00b2 ) = 89 - 80.\n\nSimplify:\n\n4ps + 4qt + 4ru = 9.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nps + qt + ru = 9/4.\n\nSo now, we have:\n\nEquation 1: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nEquation 4: s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + u\u00b2 = 297/4.\n\nEquation 5: ps + qt + ru = 9/4.\n\nSo, now, I need to find p, q, r, s, t, u that satisfy these.\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can choose some variables to simplify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the tetrahedron is symmetric in some way, so perhaps the coordinates can be chosen such that p = s, q = t, r = u? Let me test that.\n\nIf p = s, q = t, r = u, then Equation 5 becomes p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 9/4.\n\nBut from Equation 1, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 41/4, which is not equal to 9/4. So, this is a contradiction. Therefore, p, q, r are not equal to s, t, u.\n\nAlternatively, maybe p = s, q = -t, r = u? Let me try.\n\nIf p = s, q = -t, r = u.\n\nThen, Equation 5 becomes p*s + q*t + r*u = p\u00b2 - q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 9/4.\n\nBut from Equation 1: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nSo, subtracting these equations:\n\n(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) - (p\u00b2 - q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) = 41/4 - 9/4.\n\nSimplify: 2 q\u00b2 = 32/4 = 8 => q\u00b2 = 4 => q = \u00b12.\n\nSo, if q = 2 or q = -2.\n\nThen, from Equation 1: p\u00b2 + 4 + r\u00b2 = 41/4 => p\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 41/4 - 16/4 = 25/4.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 25/4.\n\nAlso, Equation 4: s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + u\u00b2 = 297/4.\n\nBut since s = p, t = -q = \u22132, u = r.\n\nSo, s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + u\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + 4 + r\u00b2 = 297/4.\n\nBut p\u00b2 + r\u00b2 =25/4, so 25/4 + 4 = 297/4.\n\nCompute 25/4 + 16/4 = 41/4. But 41/4 \u2260 297/4. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, the assumption that p = s, q = -t, r = u is invalid.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Since this is getting complicated, perhaps I should stick with the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can note that for a disphenoid, the volume can be expressed in terms of the edges.\n\nWait, I found a formula online (but since I can't access, I have to recall) that for a disphenoid with edges a, a, b, b, c, c, the volume is V = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )) / (6*sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can look for properties of a disphenoid.\n\nIn a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles. So, in our case, each face has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, each face is a triangle with sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nThe area of each face can be computed using Heron's formula.\n\nLet me compute the area of one face.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.\n\nBut Heron's formula would require computing sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], which is messy with square roots.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the area using vectors or coordinates.\n\nWait, perhaps if I can find vectors for two edges of the face, compute their cross product, and find the area as half the magnitude.\n\nBut to do that, I need coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the area of a triangle given three sides: Heron's formula.\n\nWait, let's proceed step by step.\n\nCompute the area of one face, say triangle ABC with sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.\n\nThen, area = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nWhich is another form of Heron's formula.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nCompute (a + b + c) = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)\n\n(-a + b + c) = -sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)\n\n(a - b + c) = sqrt(41) - sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)\n\n(a + b - c) = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) - sqrt(89)\n\nSo, the product is:\n\n[ (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) * (-sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) * (sqrt(41) - sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) * (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) - sqrt(89)) ]\n\nThis looks like the product of (x + y + z)(-x + y + z)(x - y + z)(x + y - z), which is equal to 2x\u00b2y\u00b2 + 2x\u00b2z\u00b2 + 2y\u00b2z\u00b2 - x\u2074 - y\u2074 - z\u2074.\n\nSo, substituting x = sqrt(41), y = sqrt(80), z = sqrt(89):\n\nProduct = 2*(41)*(80) + 2*(41)*(89) + 2*(80)*(89) - (41)^2 - (80)^2 - (89)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n2*41*80 = 2*3280 = 6560\n\n2*41*89 = 2*3649 = 7298\n\n2*80*89 = 2*7120 = 14240\n\nSum of these: 6560 + 7298 = 13858; 13858 + 14240 = 28098.\n\nNow subtract:\n\n41^2 = 1681\n\n80^2 = 6400\n\n89^2 = 7921\n\nSum: 1681 + 6400 = 8081; 8081 + 7921 = 16002.\n\nSo, product = 28098 - 16002 = 12096.\n\nTherefore, the area squared is (1/4)^2 * 12096 = (1/16) * 12096 = 756.\n\nWait, wait, let me check:\n\nWait, the formula is Area = (1/4) * sqrt( product )\n\nSo, product is 12096, so sqrt(12096) = ?\n\nCompute sqrt(12096):\n\n12096 divided by 16 is 756, so sqrt(12096) = 4*sqrt(756).\n\n756 can be broken down: 756 = 4*189 = 4*9*21 = 4*9*3*7.\n\nSo sqrt(756) = 2*3*sqrt(21) = 6*sqrt(21).\n\nThus, sqrt(12096) = 4*6*sqrt(21) = 24*sqrt(21).\n\nTherefore, Area = (1/4) * 24*sqrt(21) = 6*sqrt(21).\n\nSo, each face has area 6*sqrt(21). Therefore, the total surface area S = 4 * 6*sqrt(21) = 24*sqrt(21).\n\nGreat, so S is 24\u221a21.\n\nNow, I need to compute the volume V.\n\nWait, earlier I tried the Cayley-Menger determinant, which is a way to compute the volume given all the edge lengths. Let me try that again.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron is:\n\n| 0 1 1 1 1 |\n\n| 1 0 a\u00b2 b\u00b2 c\u00b2 |\n\n| 1 a\u00b2 0 d\u00b2 e\u00b2 |\n\n| 1 b\u00b2 d\u00b2 0 f\u00b2 |\n\n| 1 c\u00b2 e\u00b2 f\u00b2 0 |\n\nThe determinant of this matrix divided by 288 gives the square of the volume.\n\nSo, let's assign the edge lengths:\n\nAB\u00b2 = 41, AC\u00b2 = 80, AD\u00b2 = 89,\n\nBC\u00b2 = 89, BD\u00b2 = 80, CD\u00b2 = 41.\n\nSo, the matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nNow, compute the determinant of this matrix.\n\nThis is a 5x5 determinant, which is quite involved, but perhaps we can find some symmetry or perform row operations to simplify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can note that the determinant is the same as the determinant of a symmetric matrix, so perhaps we can use properties of symmetric matrices, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can expand the determinant using minors, but that would take a long time.\n\nWait, perhaps I can subtract Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4 to create zeros.\n\nLet me perform row operations:\n\nRow 2' = Row 2 - Row 1: [1-1, 41-0, 0-41, 89-80, 80-89] => [0, 41, -41, 9, -9]\n\nSimilarly, Row 3' = Row 3 - Row 1: [1-1, 80-0, 89-41, 0-80, 41-89] => [0, 80, 48, -80, -48]\n\nRow 4' = Row 4 - Row 1: [1-1, 89-0, 80-41, 41-80, 0-89] => [0, 89, 39, -39, -89]\n\nSo, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 0, 41, -41, 9, -9\n\nRow 3: 0, 80, 48, -80, -48\n\nRow 4: 0, 89, 39, -39, -89\n\nNow, the determinant remains the same because we subtracted rows. Now, we can expand along the first column, which has four zeros and a 1.\n\nThe determinant is equal to 1 * det(minor) where minor is the 4x4 matrix:\n\nRow 0: 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 41, -41, 9, -9\n\nRow 2: 80, 48, -80, -48\n\nRow 3: 89, 39, -39, -89\n\nSo, the determinant is 1 * det of this 4x4 matrix.\n\nNow, compute the determinant of this 4x4 matrix.\n\nLet me write it again:\n\nRow 0: 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 41, -41, 9, -9\n\nRow 2: 80, 48, -80, -48\n\nRow 3: 89, 39, -39, -89\n\nLet me denote this matrix as M.\n\nCompute det(M).\n\nAgain, perhaps perform row operations to simplify.\n\nLet me subtract Row 0 from Rows 1, 2, 3.\n\nRow 1' = Row1 - Row0: 41-1, -41-1, 9-1, -9-1 => 40, -42, 8, -10\n\nRow 2' = Row2 - Row0: 80-1, 48-1, -80-1, -48-1 => 79, 47, -81, -49\n\nRow 3' = Row3 - Row0: 89-1, 39-1, -39-1, -89-1 => 88, 38, -40, -90\n\nSo, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow 0: 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 40, -42, 8, -10\n\nRow 2: 79, 47, -81, -49\n\nRow 3: 88, 38, -40, -90\n\nNow, expand the determinant along Row 0.\n\ndet(M) = 1 * det(minor11) - 1 * det(minor12) + 1 * det(minor13) - 1 * det(minor14)\n\nWhere minor11 is the 3x3 matrix:\n\nRow 0: -42, 8, -10\n\nRow 1: 47, -81, -49\n\nRow 2: 38, -40, -90\n\nSimilarly, minor12:\n\nRow 0: 40, 8, -10\n\nRow 1: 79, -81, -49\n\nRow 2: 88, -40, -90\n\nminor13:\n\nRow 0: 40, -42, -10\n\nRow 1: 79, 47, -49\n\nRow 2: 88, 38, -90\n\nminor14:\n\nRow 0: 40, -42, 8\n\nRow 1: 79, 47, -81\n\nRow 2: 88, 38, -40\n\nThis is getting complicated, but let me compute each minor.\n\nFirst, compute minor11:\n\n| -42   8   -10 |\n\n| 47  -81  -49 |\n\n| 38  -40  -90 |\n\nCompute the determinant:\n\n-42*( (-81)(-90) - (-49)(-40) ) - 8*(47*(-90) - (-49)*38) + (-10)*(47*(-40) - (-81)*38 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: -42*(7290 - 1960) = -42*(5330) = -42*5330.\n\nCompute 42 * 5000 = 210000; 42*330=13860 \u2192 total 223860.

Maybe I messed up the signs in the expansion.\n\nWait, the cofactor expansion for a 4x4 matrix is:\n\ndet(M) = m11*M11 - m12*M12 + m13*M13 - m14*M14\n\nWhere Mij are the minors with their signs.\n\nIn our case, the first row is [1,1,1,1], so:\n\ndet(M) = 1*det(minor11) - 1*det(minor12) + 1*det(minor13) - 1*det(minor14)\n\nWhich is exactly what I did. But the determinant came out negative, which is confusing because the volume squared should be positive.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the minors.\n\nWait, let me check minor11:\n\n| -42   8   -10 |\n\n| 47  -81  -49 |\n\n| 38  -40  -90 |\n\nI think I messed up the sign somewhere.\n\nWait, the determinant calculation for minor11:\n\nFirst term: -42*( (-81)(-90) - (-49)(-40) ) = -42*(7290 - 1960) = -42*5330 = -223,860.\n\nSecond term: -8*(47*(-90) - (-49)*38 ) = -8*(-4230 + 1862) = -8*(-2368) = 18,944.\n\nThird term: (-10)*(47*(-40) - (-81)*38 ) = (-10)*(-1880 + 3078) = (-10)*(1198) = -11,980.\n\nSo, total: -223,860 + 18,944 -11,980 = (-223,860 + 18,944) = -204,916; -204,916 - 11,980 = -216,896. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, minor12:\n\n|40   8   -10|\n\n|79  -81  -49|\n\n|88  -40  -90|\n\nFirst term: 40*( (-81)(-90) - (-49)(-40) ) = 40*(7290 - 1960) = 40*5330=213,200.\n\nSecond term: -8*(79*(-90) - (-49)*88 ) = -8*(-7110 + 4312) = -8*(-2798) = 22,384.\n\nThird term: (-10)*(79*(-40) - (-81)*88 ) = (-10)*(-3160 + 7128) = (-10)*(3968) = -39,680.\n\nTotal: 213,200 + 22,384 -39,680 = 195,904. Correct.\n\nMinor13:\n\n|40  -42  -10|\n\n|79   47  -49|\n\n|88   38  -90|\n\nFirst term: 40*(47*(-90) - (-49)*38 ) =40*(-4230 + 1862)=40*(-2368)= -94,720.\n\nSecond term: -(-42)*(79*(-90) - (-49)*88 )=42*(-7110 +4312)=42*(-2798)= -117,516.\n\nThird term: (-10)*(79*38 -47*88 )= (-10)*(3002 - 4136)= (-10)*(-1134)=11,340.\n\nTotal: -94,720 -117,516 +11,340 = -200,896.\n\nMinor14:\n\n|40  -42    8 |\n\n|79   47  -81 |\n\n|88   38  -40 |\n\nFirst term:40*(47*(-40) - (-81)*38 )=40*(-1880 +3078)=40*(1198)=47,920.\n\nSecond term:-(-42)*(79*(-40) - (-81)*88 )=42*(-3160 +7098)=42*(3938)=165,396.\n\nThird term:8*(79*38 -47*88 )=8*(3002 -4136)=8*(-1134)= -9,072.\n\nTotal:47,920 +165,396 -9,072=204,244.\n\nSo, the minors are correct. Then, det(M) = (-216,896) - (195,904) + (-200,896) - (204,244) = -216,896 -195,904 = -412,800; -412,800 -200,896 = -613,696; -613,696 -204,244 = -817,940.\n\nBut the determinant is negative. However, since the volume squared is positive, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign during expansion.\n\nWait, the determinant is negative, but the volume squared is positive, so maybe I missed a sign somewhere in the expansion.\n\nWait, the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix is 288 V\u00b2. Since V\u00b2 is positive, the determinant should be positive. So, getting a negative determinant suggests I might have messed up the order of the rows or columns.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have used the absolute value, so |det(M)| = 817,940.\n\nThen, Volume squared is |det(M)| / 288.\n\nSo, V\u00b2 = 817,940 / 288.\n\nCompute 817,940 \u00f7 288.\n\nFirst, let me divide numerator and denominator by 4: 817,940 /4=204,485; 288/4=72.\n\nSo, 204,485 /72 \u2248 2840.07.\n\nWait, but 72*2840=204,480, so 204,485 -204,480=5 \u2192 2840 +5/72 \u22482840.069.\n\nBut maybe I can compute it as a fraction.\n\n817,940 /288 = (817940 \u00f7 4) / (288 \u00f74) = 204,485 /72.\n\nCan I reduce this fraction?\n\nLet me see if 204,485 and 72 have a common divisor.\n\n72 factors: 2^3 * 3^2.\n\nCheck if 204,485 is divisible by 2: it's odd, so no.\n\nDivisible by 3: sum digits 2+0+4+4+8+5=23, which is not divisible by 3. So, no.\n\nSo, 204,485 /72 is the reduced fraction.\n\nThus, V\u00b2 = 204,485 /72.\n\nTherefore, V = sqrt(204,485 /72).\n\nSimplify sqrt(204485 /72) = sqrt(204485)/sqrt(72).\n\nSimplify sqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2).\n\nSo, V = sqrt(204485)/(6*sqrt(2)).\n\nBut 204485 is a large number, let me see if it's a perfect square or can be factored.\n\nWait, 204485 divided by 5 is 40,897. 40,897 divided by 7? 7*5842=40,894, remainder 3. Not divisible by 7.\n\nDivided by 11: 4+8+7=19; 0+9+4=13; 19-13=6, not divisible by 11.\n\nDivided by 13: 40,897 \u00f713=3,145.923... not integer.\n\nSo, perhaps 204,485 is 5 * 40,897, and 40,897 is prime? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant calculation. Because 817,940 is quite a big number, and the volume seems too large.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe I should compute the volume using another method, given that all faces are congruent.\n\nWait, since all faces are congruent and the tetrahedron is isohedral, the volume can be calculated as (4/3) times the area of a face times the inradius. But no, wait, the formula is V = (1/3) * base area * height. But since all faces are congruent, but the heights from the incenter to each face are equal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume using the formula V = (sqrt(2)/12) * a * b * c, but that's for a regular tetrahedron, which this isn't.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula for the volume of a disphenoid.\n\nI found a formula: For a disphenoid, the volume is V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) ) / 8.\n\nWait, let me check the formula.\n\nWait, maybe it's V = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )) / (6*sqrt(2)).\n\nLet me test this.\n\nGiven a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 = 41 + 80 - 89 = 32.\n\na\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 41 - 80 + 89 = 50.\n\n-b\u00b2 + a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = -80 +41 +89=50.\n\nSo, product = 32 * 50 * 50 = 32 * 2500 = 80,000.\n\nThen, V = sqrt(80,000) / (6*sqrt(2)).\n\nsqrt(80,000) = sqrt(80 * 1000) = sqrt(80) * sqrt(1000) = 4*sqrt(5) * 10*sqrt(10) = 40*sqrt(50) = 40*5*sqrt(2) = 200*sqrt(2).\n\nSo, V = (200*sqrt(2)) / (6*sqrt(2)) )= 200/6 = 100/3.\n\nWait, that's much simpler! So, the volume is 100/3.\n\nWait, that makes more sense.\n\nSo, V = 100/3.\n\nTherefore, the volume is 100/3.\n\nSo, now, the inradius r = 3V / S = 3*(100/3) / (24*sqrt(21)) )= 100 / (24*sqrt(21)).\n\nSimplify 100 / (24*sqrt(21)).\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 4: 25 / (6*sqrt(21)).\n\nRationalize the denominator: 25*sqrt(21) / (6*21) )= 25*sqrt(21) / 126.\n\nSimplify 25 and 126: 25 and 126 are coprime, so it's 25\u221a21 / 126.\n\nThus, the inradius is 25\u221a21 / 126.\n\nSo, m=25, n=21, p=126.\n\nBut wait, 25 and 126 have a common factor? 25 is 5^2, 126 is 2*3^2*7. So, no common factors.\n\nWait, but 25 and 126 are coprime.\n\nSo, m=25, n=21, p=126.\n\nThus, m + n + p =25 +21 +126= 172.\n\nWait, but let me check the formula again.\n\nI used the formula V = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) ) / (6*sqrt(2)).\n\nBut when I plugged in a=sqrt(41), b=sqrt(80), c=sqrt(89):\n\nCompute (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)=41+80-89=32,\n\n(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)=41-80+89=50,\n\n(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)= -41+80+89=128.\n\nWait, wait, that's different. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, in the formula, the third term is (-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2), not (-b\u00b2 + a\u00b2 + c\u00b2).\n\nWait, no, the three terms are:\n\n(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2),\n\n(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2),\n\n(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2).\n\nSo, for a=41, b=80, c=89,\n\n1. 41 +80 -89=32,\n\n2.41 -80 +89=50,\n\n3.-41 +80 +89=128.\n\nSo, product is 32 *50 *128.\n\n32*50=1600,\n\n1600*128=204,800.\n\nSo, sqrt(204,800)=sqrt(2048 * 100)=10*sqrt(2048).\n\n2048=1024*2=32^2 *2.\n\nSo sqrt(2048)=32*sqrt(2).\n\nThus, sqrt(204800)=10*32*sqrt(2)=320*sqrt(2).\n\nThus, V=320*sqrt(2)/(6*sqrt(2))=320/6=160/3.\n\nWait, that's different. So, my earlier calculation was wrong.\n\nWait, where did I go wrong?\n\nIn the formula, the product is (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2).\n\nSo, 32 *50 *128=204,800.\n\nsqrt(204,800)=sqrt(2048*100)=sqrt(2048)*10= (32*sqrt(2))*10=320*sqrt(2).\n\nThen, V=320*sqrt(2)/(6*sqrt(2))=320/6=160/3.\n\nSo, V=160/3.\n\nWait, that makes more sense.\n\nEarlier, I had 100/3, but that was because I made a mistake in computing the third term as 50 instead of 128.\n\nSo, correct volume is V=160/3.\n\nSo, now, inradius r=3V/S=3*(160/3)/(24*sqrt(21))=160/(24*sqrt(21)).\n\nSimplify 160/24: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 20/3.\n\nSo, r=20/(3*sqrt(21)).\n\nRationalize: 20*sqrt(21)/(3*21)=20*sqrt(21)/63.\n\nSimplify 20 and 63: they have no common factors, so r=20\u221a21 /63.\n\nThus, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nCheck if 20 and 63 are coprime: 20 factors 2^2*5; 63=7*3^2. No common factors. n=21, which is 3*7, not divisible by square of any prime.\n\nThus, m +n +p=20+21+63=104.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the formula gave me V=160/3, but when I computed the Cayley-Menger determinant, I got det(M)=817,940, so V\u00b2=817,940/288= approx 2840, which is way bigger than (160/3)^2\u22482560.\n\nWait, so there must be a mistake in the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me look up the correct formula for the volume of a disphenoid.\n\nUpon checking, the correct formula is V = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )) / (6*sqrt(2)).\n\nSo, with a=sqrt(41), b=sqrt(80), c=sqrt(89):\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2=41, b\u00b2=80, c\u00b2=89.\n\n(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)=41+80-89=32,\n\n(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)=41-80+89=50,\n\n(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)= -41+80+89=128.\n\nProduct:32*50*128=204,800.\n\nsqrt(204,800)=sqrt(2048*100)=sqrt(2048)*10= (32*sqrt(2))*10=320*sqrt(2).\n\nThen, V=320*sqrt(2)/(6*sqrt(2))=320/6=160/3.\n\nSo, V=160/3.\n\nThus, the volume is 160/3.\n\nTherefore, the inradius r=3V/S= (3*(160/3))/ (24*sqrt(21))=160/(24*sqrt(21)).\n\nSimplify:\n\n160 \u00f7 24 = 20/3.\n\nSo, r=20/(3*sqrt(21)).\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\n20*sqrt(21)/(3*21)=20*sqrt(21)/63.\n\nThus, r= (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nSum:20+21+63=104.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the Cayley-Menger determinant gave V\u00b2=204,485/72\u22482840, but 160/3 squared is (25600/9)\u22482844.44, which is close to 2840. So, perhaps due to calculation errors, the determinant result is slightly off, but the formula gives a precise answer.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 20\u221a21 /63, so m +n +p=20+21+63=104.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD, and all the opposite edges are equal. That is, AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). I need to find the distance from the incenter I to each face, which is the same for all faces. The answer should be in the form m\u221an / p, and then find m + n + p.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula: inradius r = 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area.\n\nSo, I need to find both the volume and the surface area of this tetrahedron.\n\nBut wait, calculating the surface area might be tricky because each face is a triangle, and I don't know their areas yet. Maybe I can find the areas of the faces using Heron's formula, but for that, I need to know the lengths of all edges of each face.\n\nWait, but the problem gives me the lengths of opposite edges. Let me list all the edges:\n\nAB = sqrt(41)\nBC = sqrt(89)\nCD = sqrt(41)\nDA = sqrt(89)\n\nAC = sqrt(80)\nBD = sqrt(80)\n\nSo, each face is a triangle with sides from these lengths. Let me figure out what each face looks like.\n\nFaces:\n1. ABC: edges AB, BC, AC\n2. ABD: edges AB, BD, AD\n3. ACD: edges AC, CD, AD\n4. BCD: edges BC, CD, BD\n\nWait, so each face has two edges of one length and one edge of another. For example, face ABC has AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), and AC = sqrt(80). Similarly, face ABD has AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), and AD = sqrt(89). Same with the others. So each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89).\n\nWait a second, so all four faces are congruent triangles? Because each face has sides of sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, all faces are congruent. That might simplify things because then each face has the same area.\n\nSo, if I can compute the area of one face, I can multiply it by four to get the total surface area S.\n\nLet me compute the area of one face, say triangle ABC with sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nUsing Heron's formula: the area is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nFirst, compute s: (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.\n\nHmm, but that seems messy. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, maybe I can check if the triangle is right-angled. Let me see: does (sqrt(41))^2 + (sqrt(80))^2 equal (sqrt(89))^2?\n\nCompute 41 + 80 = 121, and sqrt(89)^2 is 89. 121 \u2260 89, so not right-angled. What about other combinations? Let's check all possibilities.\n\nWait, 41 + 89 = 130, which is not 80. 80 + 89 = 169, which is 13^2, but 41 is not equal to 169. So, no, it's not right-angled.\n\nHmm, so maybe Heron's formula is the way to go. But the square roots might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can use vectors or coordinates to find the volume and areas.\n\nWait, perhaps placing the tetrahedron in coordinate space could help. Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron.\n\nLet me think: if I can assign coordinates to the vertices such that the opposite edges are equal, that might help compute the volume and other properties.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the vertices. Let me suppose that point A is at (x, y, z), B at (a, b, c), C at (d, e, f), D at (g, h, i). But that might be too many variables. Alternatively, maybe I can use symmetry.\n\nWait, I remember that in a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, it's called an isosceles tetrahedron, and it has some properties, like having all face areas equal, and having a centroid that coincides with the incenter and circumcenter.\n\nWait, so if all faces are congruent, then their areas are equal, so the inradius can be found by 3V / S, where S is 4 times the area of one face.\n\nBut then, I need to compute V, the volume.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nYes, the Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:\n\nVolume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the matrix:\n\n0 1 1 1 1\n\n1 0 a\u00b2 b\u00b2 c\u00b2\n\n1 a\u00b2 0 d\u00b2 e\u00b2\n\n1 b\u00b2 d\u00b2 0 f\u00b2\n\n1 c\u00b2 e\u00b2 f\u00b2 0\n\nSo, let me assign the given edge lengths:\n\nAB = sqrt(41) => AB\u00b2 = 41\n\nAC = sqrt(80) => AC\u00b2 = 80\n\nAD = sqrt(89) => AD\u00b2 = 89\n\nBC = sqrt(89) => BC\u00b2 = 89\n\nBD = sqrt(80) => BD\u00b2 = 80\n\nCD = sqrt(41) => CD\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo, the Cayley-Menger determinant matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nThe matrix is 5x5, with the first row and column being [0,1,1,1,1] and [0,1,1,1,1]^T.\n\nThen, the (1,2) entry is AB\u00b2 = 41, (1,3)=AC\u00b2=80, (1,4)=AD\u00b2=89.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1)=AB\u00b2=41, (2,3)=BC\u00b2=89, (2,4)=BD\u00b2=80.\n\n(3,1)=AC\u00b2=80, (3,2)=BC\u00b2=89, (3,4)=CD\u00b2=41.\n\n(4,1)=AD\u00b2=89, (4,2)=BD\u00b2=80, (4,3)=CD\u00b2=41.\n\nSo the Cayley-Menger determinant matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 1 1 1\n\nRow 1: 1 0 41 80 89\n\nRow 2: 1 41 0 89 80\n\nRow 3: 1 80 89 0 41\n\nRow 4: 1 89 80 41 0\n\nNow, I need to compute the determinant of this matrix. But 5x5 determinants are a bit complicated. Maybe I can use some symmetry or properties to simplify it.\n\nWait, I notice that the matrix is symmetric except for the first row and column. Maybe we can perform some row or column operations to simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize that the tetrahedron is isohedral, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the determinant step by step.\n\nBut computing a 5x5 determinant manually is time-consuming. Maybe I can expand along the first row.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n0 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor)\n\nBut the first term is zero, so it's:\n\n-1 * det(M1) + 1 * det(M2) - 1 * det(M3) + 1 * det(M4)\n\nWhere M1 is the minor for element (0,1), M2 for (0,2), etc.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the determinant is zero if the points are coplanar, but in this case, it's a tetrahedron, so the determinant should be non-zero.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a smarter way. Maybe I can note that the given tetrahedron is such that all opposite edges are equal, which makes it a disphenoid. And for a disphenoid, there's a formula for the volume.\n\nI recall that in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) ) / 8\n\nWait, no, perhaps that's for a different kind of tetrahedron. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the volume using the formula for a disphenoid.\n\nWait, a disphenoid has four congruent triangular faces. Wait, in our case, all four faces are congruent, as each face has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So yes, it's a regular disphenoid.\n\nIn a regular disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )) / 72\n\nWait, I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the volume of a disphenoid in terms of its edges.\n\nWait, another approach: since all four faces are congruent, perhaps the tetrahedron is isohedral, and there might be a formula for its volume in terms of the edge lengths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant as I initially thought, despite the complexity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assign coordinates to the vertices in a symmetric way.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me place the tetrahedron such that the midpoints of opposite edges coincide at the origin. Since opposite edges are equal, this might help.\n\nLet me denote the midpoints of AB and CD as M, and the midpoints of AC and BD as N, and the midpoints of AD and BC as P.\n\nBut since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps the centroid is at the origin.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can assign coordinates such that the centroid is at (0,0,0), and the vertices are symmetric.\n\nWait, perhaps I can let points A, B, C, D have coordinates such that:\n\nA = (x, y, z)\n\nB = (-x, -y, -z)\n\nC = (a, b, c)\n\nD = (-a, -b, -c)\n\nBecause in this way, the midpoints of AB and CD are both at the origin, and similarly for other pairs.\n\nBut wait, let me think: if AB and CD are opposite edges, then the midpoints of AB and CD should coincide if the tetrahedron is symmetric.\n\nWait, maybe I can set the coordinates as follows:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nA = (p, q, r)\n\nB = (-p, -q, -r)\n\nC = (s, t, u)\n\nD = (-s, -t, -u)\n\nIn this case, the midpoints of AB and CD are both (0,0,0).\n\nThen, the edges AB and CD both have length sqrt( (2p)^2 + (2q)^2 + (2r)^2 ) = 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2). Similarly, edges AC and BD would have lengths sqrt( (p + s)^2 + (q + t)^2 + (r + u)^2 ), and edges AD and BC would have lengths sqrt( (p - s)^2 + (q - t)^2 + (r - u)^2 ).\n\nWait, but in the problem, AB = CD = sqrt(41), so 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) = sqrt(41) => sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) = sqrt(41)/2.\n\nSimilarly, AC = BD = sqrt(80). Let me compute AC: the distance between A = (p,q,r) and C = (s,t,u) is sqrt( (p - s)^2 + (q - t)^2 + (r - u)^2 ) = sqrt(80). Similarly, BD is the distance between B = (-p,-q,-r) and D = (-s,-t,-u), which is sqrt( ( -p + s )^2 + ( -q + t )^2 + ( -r + u )^2 ) = sqrt( (s - p)^2 + (t - q)^2 + (u - r)^2 ) = same as AC, which is sqrt(80).\n\nSimilarly, AD = BC = sqrt(89). AD is the distance between A = (p,q,r) and D = (-s,-t,-u): sqrt( (p + s)^2 + (q + t)^2 + (r + u)^2 ). BC is the distance between B = (-p,-q,-r) and C = (s,t,u): sqrt( (s + p)^2 + (t + q)^2 + (u + r)^2 ), which is the same as AD.\n\nSo, the conditions are:\n\n1. AB = sqrt(41) => 2*sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) = sqrt(41) => sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) = sqrt(41)/2.\n\n2. AC = sqrt(80) => sqrt( (p - s)^2 + (q - t)^2 + (r - u)^2 ) = sqrt(80).\n\n3. AD = sqrt(89) => sqrt( (p + s)^2 + (q + t)^2 + (r + u)^2 ) = sqrt(89).\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\nEquation 1: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = (sqrt(41)/2)^2 = 41/4.\n\nEquation 2: (p - s)^2 + (q - t)^2 + (r - u)^2 = 80.\n\nEquation 3: (p + s)^2 + (q + t)^2 + (r + u)^2 = 89.\n\nLet me expand Equations 2 and 3.\n\nEquation 2 expanded:\n\np\u00b2 - 2ps + s\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qt + t\u00b2 + r\u00b2 - 2ru + u\u00b2 = 80.\n\nEquation 3 expanded:\n\np\u00b2 + 2ps + s\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qt + t\u00b2 + r\u00b2 + 2ru + u\u00b2 = 89.\n\nNow, let me add Equation 2 and Equation 3:\n\n( p\u00b2 - 2ps + s\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qt + t\u00b2 + r\u00b2 - 2ru + u\u00b2 ) + ( p\u00b2 + 2ps + s\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qt + t\u00b2 + r\u00b2 + 2ru + u\u00b2 ) = 80 + 89.\n\nSimplify:\n\n2p\u00b2 + 2s\u00b2 + 2q\u00b2 + 2t\u00b2 + 2r\u00b2 + 2u\u00b2 = 169.\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\np\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + r\u00b2 + u\u00b2 = 169/2.\n\nBut from Equation 1, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 41/4. So, substituting that into the above:\n\n41/4 + s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + u\u00b2 = 169/2.\n\nSubtract 41/4: s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + u\u00b2 = 169/2 - 41/4 = (338 - 41)/4 = 297/4.\n\nSo, s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + u\u00b2 = 297/4.\n\nNow, let's subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3:\n\n( p\u00b2 + 2ps + s\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qt + t\u00b2 + r\u00b2 + 2ru + u\u00b2 ) - ( p\u00b2 - 2ps + s\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qt + t\u00b2 + r\u00b2 - 2ru + u\u00b2 ) = 89 - 80.\n\nSimplify:\n\n4ps + 4qt + 4ru = 9.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nps + qt + ru = 9/4.\n\nSo now, we have:\n\nEquation 1: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nEquation 4: s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + u\u00b2 = 297/4.\n\nEquation 5: ps + qt + ru = 9/4.\n\nSo, now, I need to find p, q, r, s, t, u that satisfy these.\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can choose some variables to simplify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the tetrahedron is symmetric in some way, so perhaps the coordinates can be chosen such that p = s, q = t, r = u? Let me test that.\n\nIf p = s, q = t, r = u, then Equation 5 becomes p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 9/4.\n\nBut from Equation 1, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 41/4, which is not equal to 9/4. So, this is a contradiction. Therefore, p, q, r are not equal to s, t, u.\n\nAlternatively, maybe p = s, q = -t, r = u? Let me try.\n\nIf p = s, q = -t, r = u.\n\nThen, Equation 5 becomes p*s + q*t + r*u = p\u00b2 - q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 9/4.\n\nBut from Equation 1: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nSo, subtracting these equations:\n\n(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) - (p\u00b2 - q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) = 41/4 - 9/4.\n\nSimplify: 2 q\u00b2 = 32/4 = 8 => q\u00b2 = 4 => q = \u00b12.\n\nSo, if q = 2 or q = -2.\n\nThen, from Equation 1: p\u00b2 + 4 + r\u00b2 = 41/4 => p\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 41/4 - 16/4 = 25/4.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 25/4.\n\nAlso, Equation 4: s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + u\u00b2 = 297/4.\n\nBut since s = p, t = -q = \u22132, u = r.\n\nSo, s\u00b2 + t\u00b2 + u\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + 4 + r\u00b2 = 297/4.\n\nBut p\u00b2 + r\u00b2 =25/4, so 25/4 + 4 = 297/4.\n\nCompute 25/4 + 16/4 = 41/4. But 41/4 \u2260 297/4. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, the assumption that p = s, q = -t, r = u is invalid.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Since this is getting complicated, perhaps I should stick with the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can note that for a disphenoid, the volume can be expressed in terms of the edges.\n\nWait, I found a formula online (but since I can't access, I have to recall) that for a disphenoid with edges a, a, b, b, c, c, the volume is V = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )) / (6*sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can look for properties of a disphenoid.\n\nIn a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles. So, in our case, each face has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, each face is a triangle with sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nThe area of each face can be computed using Heron's formula.\n\nLet me compute the area of one face.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.\n\nBut Heron's formula would require computing sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], which is messy with square roots.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the area using vectors or coordinates.\n\nWait, perhaps if I can find vectors for two edges of the face, compute their cross product, and find the area as half the magnitude.\n\nBut to do that, I need coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the area of a triangle given three sides: Heron's formula.\n\nWait, let's proceed step by step.\n\nCompute the area of one face, say triangle ABC with sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.\n\nThen, area = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nWhich is another form of Heron's formula.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nCompute (a + b + c) = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)\n\n(-a + b + c) = -sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)\n\n(a - b + c) = sqrt(41) - sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)\n\n(a + b - c) = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) - sqrt(89)\n\nSo, the product is:\n\n[ (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) * (-sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) * (sqrt(41) - sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) * (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) - sqrt(89)) ]\n\nThis looks like the product of (x + y + z)(-x + y + z)(x - y + z)(x + y - z), which is equal to 2x\u00b2y\u00b2 + 2x\u00b2z\u00b2 + 2y\u00b2z\u00b2 - x\u2074 - y\u2074 - z\u2074.\n\nSo, substituting x = sqrt(41), y = sqrt(80), z = sqrt(89):\n\nProduct = 2*(41)*(80) + 2*(41)*(89) + 2*(80)*(89) - (41)^2 - (80)^2 - (89)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n2*41*80 = 2*3280 = 6560\n\n2*41*89 = 2*3649 = 7298\n\n2*80*89 = 2*7120 = 14240\n\nSum of these: 6560 + 7298 = 13858; 13858 + 14240 = 28098.\n\nNow subtract:\n\n41^2 = 1681\n\n80^2 = 6400\n\n89^2 = 7921\n\nSum: 1681 + 6400 = 8081; 8081 + 7921 = 16002.\n\nSo, product = 28098 - 16002 = 12096.\n\nTherefore, the area squared is (1/4)^2 * 12096 = (1/16) * 12096 = 756.\n\nWait, wait, let me check:\n\nWait, the formula is Area = (1/4) * sqrt( product )\n\nSo, product is 12096, so sqrt(12096) = ?\n\nCompute sqrt(12096):\n\n12096 divided by 16 is 756, so sqrt(12096) = 4*sqrt(756).\n\n756 can be broken down: 756 = 4*189 = 4*9*21 = 4*9*3*7.\n\nSo sqrt(756) = 2*3*sqrt(21) = 6*sqrt(21).\n\nThus, sqrt(12096) = 4*6*sqrt(21) = 24*sqrt(21).\n\nTherefore, Area = (1/4) * 24*sqrt(21) = 6*sqrt(21).\n\nSo, each face has area 6*sqrt(21). Therefore, the total surface area S = 4 * 6*sqrt(21) = 24*sqrt(21).\n\nGreat, so S is 24\u221a21.\n\nNow, I need to compute the volume V.\n\nWait, earlier I tried the Cayley-Menger determinant, which is a way to compute the volume given all the edge lengths. Let me try that again.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron is:\n\n| 0 1 1 1 1 |\n\n| 1 0 a\u00b2 b\u00b2 c\u00b2 |\n\n| 1 a\u00b2 0 d\u00b2 e\u00b2 |\n\n| 1 b\u00b2 d\u00b2 0 f\u00b2 |\n\n| 1 c\u00b2 e\u00b2 f\u00b2 0 |\n\nThe determinant of this matrix divided by 288 gives the square of the volume.\n\nSo, let's assign the edge lengths:\n\nAB\u00b2 = 41, AC\u00b2 = 80, AD\u00b2 = 89,\n\nBC\u00b2 = 89, BD\u00b2 = 80, CD\u00b2 = 41.\n\nSo, the matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nNow, compute the determinant of this matrix.\n\nThis is a 5x5 determinant, which is quite involved, but perhaps we can find some symmetry or perform row operations to simplify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can note that the determinant is the same as the determinant of a symmetric matrix, so perhaps we can use properties of symmetric matrices, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can expand the determinant using minors, but that would take a long time.\n\nWait, perhaps I can subtract Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4 to create zeros.\n\nLet me perform row operations:\n\nRow 2' = Row 2 - Row 1: [1-1, 41-0, 0-41, 89-80, 80-89] => [0, 41, -41, 9, -9]\n\nSimilarly, Row 3' = Row 3 - Row 1: [1-1, 80-0, 89-41, 0-80, 41-89] => [0, 80, 48, -80, -48]\n\nRow 4' = Row 4 - Row 1: [1-1, 89-0, 80-41, 41-80, 0-89] => [0, 89, 39, -39, -89]\n\nSo, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 0, 41, -41, 9, -9\n\nRow 3: 0, 80, 48, -80, -48\n\nRow 4: 0, 89, 39, -39, -89\n\nNow, the determinant remains the same because we subtracted rows. Now, we can expand along the first column, which has four zeros and a 1.\n\nThe determinant is equal to 1 * det(minor) where minor is the 4x4 matrix:\n\nRow 0: 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 41, -41, 9, -9\n\nRow 2: 80, 48, -80, -48\n\nRow 3: 89, 39, -39, -89\n\nSo, the determinant is 1 * det of this 4x4 matrix.\n\nNow, compute the determinant of this 4x4 matrix.\n\nLet me write it again:\n\nRow 0: 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 41, -41, 9, -9\n\nRow 2: 80, 48, -80, -48\n\nRow 3: 89, 39, -39, -89\n\nLet me denote this matrix as M.\n\nCompute det(M).\n\nAgain, perhaps perform row operations to simplify.\n\nLet me subtract Row 0 from Rows 1, 2, 3.\n\nRow 1' = Row1 - Row0: 41-1, -41-1, 9-1, -9-1 => 40, -42, 8, -10\n\nRow 2' = Row2 - Row0: 80-1, 48-1, -80-1, -48-1 => 79, 47, -81, -49\n\nRow 3' = Row3 - Row0: 89-1, 39-1, -39-1, -89-1 => 88, 38, -40, -90\n\nSo, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow 0: 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 40, -42, 8, -10\n\nRow 2: 79, 47, -81, -49\n\nRow 3: 88, 38, -40, -90\n\nNow, expand the determinant along Row 0.\n\ndet(M) = 1 * det(minor11) - 1 * det(minor12) + 1 * det(minor13) - 1 * det(minor14)\n\nWhere minor11 is the 3x3 matrix:\n\nRow 0: -42, 8, -10\n\nRow 1: 47, -81, -49\n\nRow 2: 38, -40, -90\n\nSimilarly, minor12:\n\nRow 0: 40, 8, -10\n\nRow 1: 79, -81, -49\n\nRow 2: 88, -40, -90\n\nminor13:\n\nRow 0: 40, -42, -10\n\nRow 1: 79, 47, -49\n\nRow 2: 88, 38, -90\n\nminor14:\n\nRow 0: 40, -42, 8\n\nRow 1: 79, 47, -81\n\nRow 2: 88, 38, -40\n\nThis is getting complicated, but let me compute each minor.\n\nFirst, compute minor11:\n\n| -42   8   -10 |\n\n| 47  -81  -49 |\n\n| 38  -40  -90 |\n\nCompute the determinant:\n\n-42*( (-81)(-90) - (-49)(-40) ) - 8*(47*(-90) - (-49)*38) + (-10)*(47*(-40) - (-81)*38 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: -42*(7290 - 1960) = -42*(5330) = -42*5330.\n\nCompute 42 * 5000 = 210000; 42*330=13860 \u2192 total 223860. So, -42*5330 = -223860.\n\nSecond term: -8*( -4230 - (-1862) ) = -8*( -4230 + 1862 ) = -8*( -2368 ) = 18944.\n\nWait, wait, let me recalculate:\n\nSecond term: -8*(47*(-90) - (-49)*38) = -8*( -4230 + 1862 ) = -8*(-2368) = 18944.\n\nThird term: (-10)*( -1880 - (-3078) ) = (-10)*( -1880 + 3078 ) = (-10)*(1198) = -11980.\n\nSo, total determinant for minor11: -223860 + 18944 - 11980 = (-223860) + (18944 - 11980) = (-223860) + 6964 = -216,896.\n\nWait, let me compute 18944 - 11980:\n\n18944 - 11980 = 6964.\n\nThen, -223860 + 6964 = -216,896.\n\nNow, compute minor12:\n\n| 40   8   -10 |\n\n| 79  -81  -49 |\n\n| 88  -40  -90 |\n\nCompute determinant:\n\n40*( (-81)(-90) - (-49)(-40) ) - 8*(79*(-90) - (-49)*88 ) + (-10)*(79*(-40) - (-81)*88 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 40*(7290 - 1960) = 40*(5330) = 213,200.\n\nSecond term: -8*( -7110 - (-4312) ) = -8*( -7110 + 4312 ) = -8*(-2798) = 22,384.\n\nThird term: (-10)*( -3160 - (-7128) ) = (-10)*( -3160 + 7128 ) = (-10)*(3968) = -39,680.\n\nSo, total determinant: 213,200 + 22,384 - 39,680 = (213,200 + 22,384) = 235,584; 235,584 - 39,680 = 195,904.\n\nNext, compute minor13:\n\n| 40  -42  -10 |\n\n| 79   47  -49 |\n\n| 88   38  -90 |\n\nCompute determinant:\n\n40*(47*(-90) - (-49)*38 ) - (-42)*(79*(-90) - (-49)*88 ) + (-10)*(79*38 - 47*88 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 40*( -4230 + 1862 ) = 40*(-2368) = -94,720.\n\nSecond term: -(-42)*( -7110 + 4312 ) = 42*( -2798 ) = -117,516.\n\nThird term: (-10)*(3002 - 4136 ) = (-10)*(-1134) = 11,340.\n\nSo, total determinant: -94,720 - 117,516 + 11,340 = (-94,720 - 117,516) = -212,236; -212,236 + 11,340 = -200,896.\n\nNow, compute minor14:\n\n| 40  -42    8 |\n\n| 79   47  -81 |\n\n| 88   38  -40 |\n\nCompute determinant:\n\n40*(47*(-40) - (-81)*38 ) - (-42)*(79*(-40) - (-81)*88 ) + 8*(79*38 - 47*88 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 40*( -1880 + 3078 ) = 40*(1198) = 47,920.\n\nSecond term: -(-42)*( -3160 + 7098 ) = 42*(3938) = 42*3938.\n\nCompute 42*3938: 40*3938=157,520; 2*3938=7,876; total 165,396.\n\nThird term: 8*(3002 - 4136 ) = 8*(-1134) = -9,072.\n\nSo, total determinant: 47,920 + 165,396 - 9,072 = (47,920 + 165,396) = 213,316; 213,316 - 9,072 = 204,244.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\ndet(M) = 1*(-216,896) - 1*(195,904) + 1*(-200,896) - 1*(204,244)\n\n= (-216,896) - 195,904 - 200,896 - 204,244\n\nWait, no, actually, the cofactor expansion is:\n\ndet(M) = 1*(det minor11) - 1*(det minor12) + 1*(det minor13) - 1*(det minor14)\n\nSo:\n\ndet(M) = (-216,896) - (195,904) + (-200,896) - (204,244)\n\nCompute term by term:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n-216,896 \u2192 total: -216,896\n\n-195,904 \u2192 total: -412,800\n\n-200,896 \u2192 total: -613,696\n\n-204,244 \u2192 total: -817,940\n\nSo, det(M) = -817,940.\n\nBut wait, this can't be right because the determinant should be positive as the volume squared is positive. Maybe I messed up the signs in the expansion.\n\nWait, the cofactor expansion for a 4x4 matrix is:\n\ndet(M) = m11*M11 - m12*M12 + m13*M13 - m14*M14\n\nWhere Mij are the minors with their signs.\n\nIn our case, the first row is [1,1,1,1], so:\n\ndet(M) = 1*det(minor11) - 1*det(minor12) + 1*det(minor13) - 1*det(minor14)\n\nWhich is exactly what I did. But the determinant came out negative, which is confusing because the volume squared should be positive.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the minors.\n\nWait, let me check minor11:\n\n| -42   8   -10 |\n\n| 47  -81  -49 |\n\n| 38  -40  -90 |\n\nI think I messed up the sign somewhere.\n\nWait, the determinant calculation for minor11:\n\nFirst term: -42*( (-81)(-90) - (-49)(-40) ) = -42*(7290 - 1960) = -42*5330 = -223,860.\n\nSecond term: -8*(47*(-90) - (-49)*38 ) = -8*(-4230 + 1862) = -8*(-2368) = 18,944.\n\nThird term: (-10)*(47*(-40) - (-81)*38 ) = (-10)*(-1880 + 3078) = (-10)*(1198) = -11,980.\n\nSo, total: -223,860 + 18,944 -11,980 = (-223,860 + 18,944) = -204,916; -204,916 - 11,980 = -216,896. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, minor12:\n\n|40   8   -10|\n\n|79  -81  -49|\n\n|88  -40  -90|\n\nFirst term: 40*( (-81)(-90) - (-49)(-40) ) = 40*(7290 - 1960) = 40*5330=213,200.\n\nSecond term: -8*(79*(-90) - (-49)*88 ) = -8*(-7110 + 4312) = -8*(-2798) = 22,384.\n\nThird term: (-10)*(79*(-40) - (-81)*88 ) = (-10)*(-3160 + 7128) = (-10)*(3968) = -39,680.\n\nTotal: 213,200 + 22,384 -39,680 = 195,904. Correct.\n\nMinor13:\n\n|40  -42  -10|\n\n|79   47  -49|\n\n|88   38  -90|\n\nFirst term: 40*(47*(-90) - (-49)*38 ) =40*(-4230 + 1862)=40*(-2368)= -94,720.\n\nSecond term: -(-42)*(79*(-90) - (-49)*88 )=42*(-7110 +4312)=42*(-2798)= -117,516.\n\nThird term: (-10)*(79*38 -47*88 )= (-10)*(3002 - 4136)= (-10)*(-1134)=11,340.\n\nTotal: -94,720 -117,516 +11,340 = -200,896.\n\nMinor14:\n\n|40  -42    8 |\n\n|79   47  -81 |\n\n|88   38  -40 |\n\nFirst term:40*(47*(-40) - (-81)*38 )=40*(-1880 +3078)=40*(1198)=47,920.\n\nSecond term:-(-42)*(79*(-40) - (-81)*88 )=42*(-3160 +7098)=42*(3938)=165,396.\n\nThird term:8*(79*38 -47*88 )=8*(3002 -4136)=8*(-1134)= -9,072.\n\nTotal:47,920 +165,396 -9,072=204,244.\n\nSo, the minors are correct. Then, det(M) = (-216,896) - (195,904) + (-200,896) - (204,244) = -216,896 -195,904 = -412,800; -412,800 -200,896 = -613,696; -613,696 -204,244 = -817,940.\n\nBut the determinant is negative. However, since the volume squared is positive, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign during expansion.\n\nWait, the determinant is negative, but the volume squared is positive, so maybe I missed a sign somewhere in the expansion.\n\nWait, the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix is 288 V\u00b2. Since V\u00b2 is positive, the determinant should be positive. So, getting a negative determinant suggests I might have messed up the order of the rows or columns.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have used the absolute value, so |det(M)| = 817,940.\n\nThen, Volume squared is |det(M)| / 288.\n\nSo, V\u00b2 = 817,940 / 288.\n\nCompute 817,940 \u00f7 288.\n\nFirst, let me divide numerator and denominator by 4: 817,940 /4=204,485; 288/4=72.\n\nSo, 204,485 /72 \u2248 2840.07.\n\nWait, but 72*2840=204,480, so 204,485 -204,480=5 \u2192 2840 +5/72 \u22482840.069.\n\nBut maybe I can compute it as a fraction.\n\n817,940 /288 = (817940 \u00f7 4) / (288 \u00f74) = 204,485 /72.\n\nCan I reduce this fraction?\n\nLet me see if 204,485 and 72 have a common divisor.\n\n72 factors: 2^3 * 3^2.\n\nCheck if 204,485 is divisible by 2: it's odd, so no.\n\nDivisible by 3: sum digits 2+0+4+4+8+5=23, which is not divisible by 3. So, no.\n\nSo, 204,485 /72 is the reduced fraction.\n\nThus, V\u00b2 = 204,485 /72.\n\nTherefore, V = sqrt(204,485 /72).\n\nSimplify sqrt(204485 /72) = sqrt(204485)/sqrt(72).\n\nSimplify sqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2).\n\nSo, V = sqrt(204485)/(6*sqrt(2)).\n\nBut 204485 is a large number, let me see if it's a perfect square or can be factored.\n\nWait, 204485 divided by 5 is 40,897. 40,897 divided by 7? 7*5842=40,894, remainder 3. Not divisible by 7.\n\nDivided by 11: 4+8+7=19; 0+9+4=13; 19-13=6, not divisible by 11.\n\nDivided by 13: 40,897 \u00f713=3,145.923... not integer.\n\nSo, perhaps 204,485 is 5 * 40,897, and 40,897 is prime? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant calculation. Because 817,940 is quite a big number, and the volume seems too large.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe I should compute the volume using another method, given that all faces are congruent.\n\nWait, since all faces are congruent and the tetrahedron is isohedral, the volume can be calculated as (4/3) times the area of a face times the inradius. But no, wait, the formula is V = (1/3) * base area * height. But since all faces are congruent, but the heights from the incenter to each face are equal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume using the formula V = (sqrt(2)/12) * a * b * c, but that's for a regular tetrahedron, which this isn't.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula for the volume of a disphenoid.\n\nI found a formula: For a disphenoid, the volume is V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) ) / 8.\n\nWait, let me check the formula.\n\nWait, maybe it's V = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )) / (6*sqrt(2)).\n\nLet me test this.\n\nGiven a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 = 41 + 80 - 89 = 32.\n\na\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 41 - 80 + 89 = 50.\n\n-b\u00b2 + a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = -80 +41 +89=50.\n\nSo, product = 32 * 50 * 50 = 32 * 2500 = 80,000.\n\nThen, V = sqrt(80,000) / (6*sqrt(2)).\n\nsqrt(80,000) = sqrt(80 * 1000) = sqrt(80) * sqrt(1000) = 4*sqrt(5) * 10*sqrt(10) = 40*sqrt(50) = 40*5*sqrt(2) = 200*sqrt(2).\n\nSo, V = (200*sqrt(2)) / (6*sqrt(2)) )= 200/6 = 100/3.\n\nWait, that's much simpler! So, the volume is 100/3.\n\nWait, that makes more sense.\n\nSo, V = 100/3.\n\nTherefore, the volume is 100/3.\n\nSo, now, the inradius r = 3V / S = 3*(100/3) / (24*sqrt(21)) )= 100 / (24*sqrt(21)).\n\nSimplify 100 / (24*sqrt(21)).\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 4: 25 / (6*sqrt(21)).\n\nRationalize the denominator: 25*sqrt(21) / (6*21) )= 25*sqrt(21) / 126.\n\nSimplify 25 and 126: 25 and 126 are coprime, so it's 25\u221a21 / 126.\n\nThus, the inradius is 25\u221a21 / 126.\n\nSo, m=25, n=21, p=126.\n\nBut wait, 25 and 126 have a common factor? 25 is 5^2, 126 is 2*3^2*7. So, no common factors.\n\nWait, but 25 and 126 are coprime.\n\nSo, m=25, n=21, p=126.\n\nThus, m + n + p =25 +21 +126= 172.\n\nWait, but let me check the formula again.\n\nI used the formula V = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) ) / (6*sqrt(2)).\n\nBut when I plugged in a=sqrt(41), b=sqrt(80), c=sqrt(89):\n\nCompute (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)=41+80-89=32,\n\n(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)=41-80+89=50,\n\n(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)= -41+80+89=128.\n\nWait, wait, that's different. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, in the formula, the third term is (-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2), not (-b\u00b2 + a\u00b2 + c\u00b2).\n\nWait, no, the three terms are:\n\n(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2),\n\n(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2),\n\n(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2).\n\nSo, for a=41, b=80, c=89,\n\n1. 41 +80 -89=32,\n\n2.41 -80 +89=50,\n\n3.-41 +80 +89=128.\n\nSo, product is 32 *50 *128.\n\n32*50=1600,\n\n1600*128=204,800.\n\nSo, sqrt(204,800)=sqrt(2048 * 100)=10*sqrt(2048).\n\n2048=1024*2=32^2 *2.\n\nSo sqrt(2048)=32*sqrt(2).\n\nThus, sqrt(204800)=10*32*sqrt(2)=320*sqrt(2).\n\nThus, V=320*sqrt(2)/(6*sqrt(2))=320/6=160/3.\n\nWait, that's different. So, my earlier calculation was wrong.\n\nWait, where did I go wrong?\n\nIn the formula, the product is (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2).\n\nSo, 32 *50 *128=204,800.\n\nsqrt(204,800)=sqrt(2048*100)=sqrt(2048)*10= (32*sqrt(2))*10=320*sqrt(2).\n\nThen, V=320*sqrt(2)/(6*sqrt(2))=320/6=160/3.\n\nSo, V=160/3.\n\nWait, that makes more sense.\n\nEarlier, I had 100/3, but that was because I made a mistake in computing the third term as 50 instead of 128.\n\nSo, correct volume is V=160/3.\n\nSo, now, inradius r=3V/S=3*(160/3)/(24*sqrt(21))=160/(24*sqrt(21)).\n\nSimplify 160/24: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 20/3.\n\nSo, r=20/(3*sqrt(21)).\n\nRationalize: 20*sqrt(21)/(3*21)=20*sqrt(21)/63.\n\nSimplify 20 and 63: they have no common factors, so r=20\u221a21 /63.\n\nThus, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nCheck if 20 and 63 are coprime: 20 factors 2^2*5; 63=7*3^2. No common factors. n=21, which is 3*7, not divisible by square of any prime.\n\nThus, m +n +p=20+21+63=104.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the formula gave me V=160/3, but when I computed the Cayley-Menger determinant, I got det(M)=817,940, so V\u00b2=817,940/288= approx 2840, which is way bigger than (160/3)^2\u22482560.\n\nWait, so there must be a mistake in the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me look up the correct formula for the volume of a disphenoid.\n\nUpon checking, the correct formula is V = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )) / (6*sqrt(2)).\n\nSo, with a=sqrt(41), b=sqrt(80), c=sqrt(89):\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2=41, b\u00b2=80, c\u00b2=89.\n\n(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)=41+80-89=32,\n\n(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)=41-80+89=50,\n\n(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)= -41+80+89=128.\n\nProduct:32*50*128=204,800.\n\nsqrt(204,800)=sqrt(2048*100)=sqrt(2048)*10= (32*sqrt(2))*10=320*sqrt(2).\n\nThen, V=320*sqrt(2)/(6*sqrt(2))=320/6=160/3.\n\nSo, V=160/3.\n\nThus, the volume is 160/3.\n\nTherefore, the inradius r=3V/S= (3*(160/3))/ (24*sqrt(21))=160/(24*sqrt(21)).\n\nSimplify:\n\n160 \u00f7 24 = 20/3.\n\nSo, r=20/(3*sqrt(21)).\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\n20*sqrt(21)/(3*21)=20*sqrt(21)/63.\n\nThus, r= (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nSum:20+21+63=104.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the Cayley-Menger determinant gave V\u00b2=204,485/72\u22482840, but 160/3 squared is (25600/9)\u22482844.44, which is close to 2840. So, perhaps due to calculation errors, the determinant result is slightly off, but the formula gives a precise answer.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 20\u221a21 /63, so m +n +p=20+21+63=104.\n\n\nThe given tetrahedron is an isosceles tetrahedron (disphenoid) with all opposite edges equal.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance should be in the form m\u221an/p, and then I need to find m + n + p. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula: inradius = 3 * volume / surface area. Wait, is that right? I think so because for a tetrahedron, the volume is (1/3)*base area*height, so if you have all the face areas, the inradius would relate the volume to the total surface area. So, maybe inradius = 3V / (sum of the areas of all faces). That sounds familiar.\n\nSo, I need to find the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area. Then, I can compute the inradius.\n\nBut first, let me note the edge lengths given. AB = CD = \u221a41, AC = BD = \u221a80, and BC = AD = \u221a89. So, opposite edges are equal. That seems like a symmetric tetrahedron. Maybe it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron? I think such a tetrahedron has some special properties, perhaps allowing us to compute volume and surface areas more easily.\n\nWait, in an isosceles tetrahedron (where opposite edges are equal), the volume can be computed using the formula sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) ) / 12 or something? Hmm, maybe I'm confusing with another formula. Alternatively, maybe it's better to place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to compute the volume.\n\nYes, maybe assigning coordinates to the vertices will help. Let's try that.\n\nSince opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron is symmetric in some way. Maybe I can position it such that the midpoints of opposite edges are at the origin or something like that. Alternatively, assign coordinates to the vertices so that the centroid is at the origin.\n\nAlternatively, I can use vectors. Let me think. Let's denote vectors for the edges. Since opposite edges are equal, maybe the vectors are negatives or something? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the tetrahedron as two congruent triangles connected in a symmetric way. Wait, but it's a tetrahedron, so all four faces are triangles.\n\nWait, another thought: in such a symmetric tetrahedron, the volume can be calculated using the formula for a regular tetrahedron, but scaled somehow. But this isn't regular because the edges are of different lengths. So, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron can be embedded in a rectangular box, such that the edges correspond to face diagonals. That might be a useful approach. I remember that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it can be inscribed in a rectangular box, and the edges correspond to face diagonals.\n\nYes, that sounds right. So, if I can model the tetrahedron as a result of connecting the four vertices of a box, then the edges of the tetrahedron would be the face diagonals of the box.\n\nLet me try to visualize that. Suppose the box has dimensions a, b, c. Then, the face diagonals would be sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2), sqrt(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2), and sqrt(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2). But in our tetrahedron, the edges are AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). Hmm.\n\nWait, each pair of opposite edges corresponds to the same face diagonal. So, perhaps:\n\nAB and CD are both sqrt(41), which would correspond to sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = sqrt(41),\nAC and BD are both sqrt(80), which would correspond to sqrt(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(80),\nBC and AD are both sqrt(89), which would correspond to sqrt(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(89).\n\nSo, if I set up the equations:\n\nsqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = sqrt(41) => a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41,\nsqrt(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(80) => a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 80,\nsqrt(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(89) => b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89.\n\nNow, I can solve for a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2.\n\nLet me write down the three equations:\n\n1. a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41,\n2. a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 80,\n3. b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89.\n\nI can subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 80 - 41 => c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 39.\n\nFrom equation 3, we have b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89.\n\nSo, now, we have:\n\nc\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 39,\nc\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 89.\n\nIf I add these two equations: 2c\u00b2 = 128 => c\u00b2 = 64 => c = 8.\n\nThen, substituting back into c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 89: 64 + b\u00b2 = 89 => b\u00b2 = 25 => b = 5.\n\nThen, from equation 1: a\u00b2 + 25 = 41 => a\u00b2 = 16 => a = 4.\n\nSo, the box has dimensions a=4, b=5, c=8.\n\nGreat, so now, the volume of the tetrahedron can be found as (a*b*c)/3. Wait, is that right? Because when a tetrahedron is formed by connecting alternate vertices of a box, its volume is (a*b*c)/3. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. Because the box has volume a*b*c, and the tetrahedron occupies 1/6 of the box, but wait, no. Wait, a box can be divided into 6 tetrahedrons each congruent to the one we're considering. So, the volume of the tetrahedron would be (a*b*c)/3? Wait, no, that would be if it's 1/3, but I think it's 1/6. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, actually, the regular tetrahedron formed by connecting alternate vertices of a cube (which is a special case of a box) has volume equal to (edge length)^3 / (6\u221a2), but that's a different scenario. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume using the scalar triple product.\n\nSince the tetrahedron is embedded in a box with edges 4, 5, 8, let's assign coordinates to the four vertices of the tetrahedron.\n\nLet me choose the four vertices as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s assume the box has one vertex at (0,0,0), and the others at (a,0,0), (0,b,0), (0,0,c), etc. But in our case, since the edges of the tetrahedron are face diagonals, the four vertices can be (0,0,0), (a,0,0), (0,b,0), (0,0,c), but wait, no, that might not give the face diagonals as edges.\n\nWait, actually, if I connect (0,0,0) to (a,b,0), (a,0,c), and (0,b,c), then the edges from (0,0,0) would be the space diagonals, not face diagonals. Hmm, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the four vertices of the tetrahedron are at (0,0,0), (a, b, 0), (a, 0, c), and (0, b, c). Then, the edges between these points would be the face diagonals. Let me check.\n\nCompute the distance between (0,0,0) and (a, b, 0): that's sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = sqrt(41).\n\nDistance between (0,0,0) and (a,0,c): sqrt(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(80).\n\nDistance between (0,0,0) and (0, b, c): sqrt(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(89).\n\nSimilarly, distance between (a, b, 0) and (a, 0, c): sqrt( (0)^2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 ) = sqrt(25 + 64) = sqrt(89). Wait, no, hold on.\n\nWait, (a, b, 0) to (a, 0, c): the difference is (0, -b, c), so distance is sqrt(0 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(25 + 64) = sqrt(89). Similarly, distance between (a, b, 0) and (0, b, c) is sqrt(a\u00b2 + 0 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(16 + 64) = sqrt(80). And the distance between (a, 0, c) and (0, b, c) is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 0) = sqrt(16 +25) = sqrt(41). So yes, this setup gives all the required edge lengths. So, the four vertices are:\n\nA = (0, 0, 0),\nB = (a, b, 0) = (4,5,0),\nC = (a, 0, c) = (4, 0, 8),\nD = (0, b, c) = (0,5,8).\n\nSo, now, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron.\n\nThe volume can be calculated using the scalar triple product formula:\n\nV = |(AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD))| / 6.\n\nWait, but let me compute vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nWait, AB is from A to B: (4,5,0).\nAC is from A to C: (4,0,8).\nAD is from A to D: (0,5,8).\n\nSo, the vectors are:\n\nAB = (4,5,0),\nAC = (4,0,8),\nAD = (0,5,8).\n\nThen, the scalar triple product is AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD).\n\nFirst, compute AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nAC \u00d7 AD = |i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a08\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a05 \u00a0\u00a08\n\nSo, determinant:\n\ni*(0*8 - 8*5) - j*(4*8 - 8*0) + k*(4*5 - 0*0)\n= i*(0 - 40) - j*(32 - 0) + k*(20 - 0)\n= (-40)i -32j +20k.\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20).\n\nNow, compute AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD):\n\nAB = (4,5,0) \u00b7 (-40, -32, 20) = 4*(-40) +5*(-32) +0*20 = -160 -160 + 0 = -320.\n\nThe absolute value is 320, so volume V = 320 / 6 = 160 / 3 \u2248 53.333.\n\nSo, V = 160/3.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check the cross product.\n\nAC \u00d7 AD:\n\ni component: (0*8 - 8*5) = 0 -40 = -40.\n\nj component: -(4*8 - 8*0) = -(32 -0) = -32.\n\nk component: (4*5 -0*0) =20.\n\nYes, so cross product is (-40, -32, 20). Then AB \u00b7 that is 4*(-40) +5*(-32) +0*20 = -160 -160 = -320. Absolute value 320, so V = 320/6 = 160/3. Yep, correct.\n\nOkay, so volume is 160/3.\n\nNow, I need to find the total surface area. The tetrahedron has four triangular faces. Each pair of opposite faces are congruent because of the symmetry.\n\nSo, each face is a triangle with sides given by the edge lengths. Let me compute the area of each face.\n\nFirst, let me list the faces:\n\nFaces are ABC, ABD, ACD, and BCD.\n\nWait, actually, in the tetrahedron, each face is a triangle with edges:\n\n- Face ABC: edges AB, BC, AC.\n\n- Face ABD: edges AB, BD, AD.\n\n- Face ACD: edges AC, CD, AD.\n\n- Face BCD: edges BC, CD, BD.\n\nGiven the symmetry, each face is congruent to the opposite face.\n\nSo, for example, face ABC is congruent to face CDA, and face ABD is congruent to face BCD.\n\nWait, but let me check the edges.\n\nFace ABC: AB=\u221a41, BC=\u221a89, AC=\u221a80.\n\nFace ABD: AB=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89.\n\nFace ACD: AC=\u221a80, CD=\u221a41, AD=\u221a89.\n\nFace BCD: BC=\u221a89, CD=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80.\n\nSo, each face has sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. So, all four faces are congruent triangles. Therefore, each face has the same area, so I can compute the area once and multiply by four.\n\nSo, let's compute the area of one face, say triangle ABC with sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nWait, let me write the sides as a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nWait, to compute the area, I can use Heron's formula.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nBut Heron's formula might be messy with square roots, but perhaps there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since the triangle has sides of length \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89, I can check if it's a right triangle.\n\nLet me compute 41 + 80 = 121. 121 = 11\u00b2, which is 121. 89 is 89, which is not 121, so it's not a right triangle. Hmm, okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the area using vectors or coordinates.\n\nWait, since I have coordinates for the points, maybe I can compute the area of triangle ABC using the cross product.\n\nPoints A(0,0,0), B(4,5,0), C(4,0,8).\n\nSo, vectors AB = (4,5,0) and AC = (4,0,8).\n\nThe area is (1/2)*|AB \u00d7 AC|.\n\nCompute AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nAB \u00d7 AC = |i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04 \u00a0\u00a05 \u00a0\u00a00\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a08\n\n= i*(5*8 - 0*0) - j*(4*8 - 0*4) + k*(4*0 -5*4)\n= i*(40) - j*(32) + k*(-20)\n= (40, -32, -20).\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024).\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024): let's factor 3024.\n\n3024 \u00f7 16 = 189. So, sqrt(16*189) = 4*sqrt(189).\n\n189 factors: 9*21 = 9*3*7. So, sqrt(189) = 3*sqrt(21).\n\nSo, sqrt(3024) = 4*3*sqrt(21) = 12\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12\u221a21 = 6\u221a21.\n\nSo, each face has area 6\u221a21, and there are four faces. So, total surface area S = 4*6\u221a21 = 24\u221a21.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with Heron's formula for cross-check.\n\nUsing Heron's formula, sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2.\n\nBut that's going to be messy. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4)*sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nBut plugging in the values:\n\n(\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)(-\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)(\u221a41 - \u221a80 + \u221a89)(\u221a41 + \u221a80 - \u221a89)\n\nThat's a bit complicated, but perhaps I can compute each term.\n\nAlternatively, since I have the area from the cross product as 6\u221a21, and I can compute Heron's formula numerically to see if it's the same.\n\nCompute 6\u221a21 \u2248 6*4.5837 \u2248 27.502.\n\nNow, Heron's formula:\n\ns = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2 \u2248 (6.4031 + 8.9443 + 9.433)/2 \u2248 (24.7804)/2 \u2248 12.3902.\n\nThen, Area = sqrt( s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) )\n\nCompute s - a \u2248 12.3902 - 6.4031 \u2248 5.9871,\n\ns - b \u2248 12.3902 - 8.9443 \u2248 3.4459,\n\ns - c \u2248 12.3902 - 9.433 \u2248 2.9572.\n\nThen, product: 12.3902 *5.9871*3.4459*2.9572.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\n12.3902 *5.9871 \u2248 12.3902*6 \u2248 74.3412, but subtract 12.3902*0.0129\u22480.159, so \u224874.182.\n\nThen, 3.4459 *2.9572 \u2248 3.4459*3\u224810.3377 minus 3.4459*0.0428\u22480.1478, so \u224810.19.\n\nSo, total product \u224874.182 *10.19 \u2248 755.43.\n\nThen, sqrt(755.43) \u2248 27.49, which is approximately 27.5, which matches 6\u221a21 \u224827.502. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the area of each face is 6\u221a21, total surface area is 24\u221a21.\n\nNow, going back to the inradius formula: inradius r = 3V / S.\n\nSo, V is 160/3, S is 24\u221a21.\n\nSo, r = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160 / (24\u221a21).\n\nSimplify 160/24: both divisible by 8, so 20/3.\n\nSo, r = (20/3) / (\u221a21) = 20/(3\u221a21).\n\nRationalize the denominator: 20\u221a21 / (3*21) = 20\u221a21 / 63.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator: 20 and 63 are coprime, 21 is square-free.\n\nSo, r = (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the distance can be written as m\u221an /p, where m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. So, in this case, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nBut wait, 20 and 63: their GCD is 1, so they are coprime. Also, 21 factors into 3*7, which is square-free. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63. Then, m + n + p = 20 +21 +63= 104.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, r = 3V / S.\n\nV is 160/3.\n\nS is 24\u221a21.\n\nSo, 3*(160/3) = 160.\n\n160 divided by 24\u221a21 = (160/24)/\u221a21 = (20/3)/\u221a21 = 20/(3\u221a21) = (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the inradius is 20\u221a21 /63, so m=20, n=21, p=63. Sum is 20 +21 +63= 104.\n\nSo, the answer is 104.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance should be in the form m\u221an/p, and then I need to find m + n + p. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula: inradius = 3 * volume / surface area. Wait, is that right? I think so because for a tetrahedron, the volume is (1/3)*base area*height, so if you have all the face areas, the inradius would relate the volume to the total surface area. So, maybe inradius = 3V / (sum of the areas of all faces). That sounds familiar.\n\nSo, I need to find the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area. Then, I can compute the inradius.\n\nBut first, let me note the edge lengths given. AB = CD = \u221a41, AC = BD = \u221a80, and BC = AD = \u221a89. So, opposite edges are equal. That seems like a symmetric tetrahedron. Maybe it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron? I think such a tetrahedron has some special properties, perhaps allowing us to compute volume and surface areas more easily.\n\nWait, in an isosceles tetrahedron (where opposite edges are equal), the volume can be computed using the formula sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) ) / 12 or something? Hmm, maybe I'm confusing with another formula. Alternatively, maybe it's better to place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to compute the volume.\n\nYes, maybe assigning coordinates to the vertices will help. Let's try that.\n\nSince opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron is symmetric in some way. Maybe I can position it such that the midpoints of opposite edges are at the origin or something like that. Alternatively, assign coordinates to the vertices so that the centroid is at the origin.\n\nAlternatively, I can use vectors. Let me think. Let's denote vectors for the edges. Since opposite edges are equal, maybe the vectors are negatives or something? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the tetrahedron as two congruent triangles connected in a symmetric way. Wait, but it's a tetrahedron, so all four faces are triangles.\n\nWait, another thought: in such a symmetric tetrahedron, the volume can be calculated using the formula for a regular tetrahedron, but scaled somehow. But this isn't regular because the edges are of different lengths. So, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron can be embedded in a rectangular box, such that the edges correspond to face diagonals. That might be a useful approach. I remember that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it can be inscribed in a rectangular box, and the edges correspond to face diagonals.\n\nYes, that sounds right. So, if I can model the tetrahedron as a result of connecting the four vertices of a box, then the edges of the tetrahedron would be the face diagonals of the box.\n\nLet me try to visualize that. Suppose the box has dimensions a, b, c. Then, the face diagonals would be sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2), sqrt(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2), and sqrt(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2). But in our tetrahedron, the edges are AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). Hmm.\n\nWait, each pair of opposite edges corresponds to the same face diagonal. So, perhaps:\n\nAB and CD are both sqrt(41), which would correspond to sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = sqrt(41),\nAC and BD are both sqrt(80), which would correspond to sqrt(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(80),\nBC and AD are both sqrt(89), which would correspond to sqrt(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(89).\n\nSo, if I set up the equations:\n\nsqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = sqrt(41) => a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41,\nsqrt(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(80) => a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 80,\nsqrt(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(89) => b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89.\n\nNow, I can solve for a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2.\n\nLet me write down the three equations:\n\n1. a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41,\n2. a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 80,\n3. b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89.\n\nI can subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 80 - 41 => c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 39.\n\nFrom equation 3, we have b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89.\n\nSo, now, we have:\n\nc\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 39,\nc\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 89.\n\nIf I add these two equations: 2c\u00b2 = 128 => c\u00b2 = 64 => c = 8.\n\nThen, substituting back into c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 89: 64 + b\u00b2 = 89 => b\u00b2 = 25 => b = 5.\n\nThen, from equation 1: a\u00b2 + 25 = 41 => a\u00b2 = 16 => a = 4.\n\nSo, the box has dimensions a=4, b=5, c=8.\n\nGreat, so now, the volume of the tetrahedron can be found as (a*b*c)/3. Wait, is that right? Because when a tetrahedron is formed by connecting alternate vertices of a box, its volume is (a*b*c)/3. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. Because the box has volume a*b*c, and the tetrahedron occupies 1/6 of the box, but wait, no. Wait, a box can be divided into 6 tetrahedrons each congruent to the one we're considering. So, the volume of the tetrahedron would be (a*b*c)/3? Wait, no, that would be if it's 1/3, but I think it's 1/6. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, actually, the regular tetrahedron formed by connecting alternate vertices of a cube (which is a special case of a box) has volume equal to (edge length)^3 / (6\u221a2), but that's a different scenario. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume using the scalar triple product.\n\nSince the tetrahedron is embedded in a box with edges 4, 5, 8, let's assign coordinates to the four vertices of the tetrahedron.\n\nLet me choose the four vertices as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s assume the box has one vertex at (0,0,0), and the others at (a,0,0), (0,b,0), (0,0,c), etc. But in our case, since the edges of the tetrahedron are face diagonals, the four vertices can be (0,0,0), (a,0,0), (0,b,0), (0,0,c), but wait, no, that might not give the face diagonals as edges.\n\nWait, actually, if I connect (0,0,0) to (a,b,0), (a,0,c), and (0,b,c), then the edges from (0,0,0) would be the space diagonals, not face diagonals. Hmm, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the four vertices of the tetrahedron are at (0,0,0), (a, b, 0), (a, 0, c), and (0, b, c). Then, the edges between these points would be the face diagonals. Let me check.\n\nCompute the distance between (0,0,0) and (a, b, 0): that's sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = sqrt(41).\n\nDistance between (0,0,0) and (a,0,c): sqrt(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(80).\n\nDistance between (0,0,0) and (0, b, c): sqrt(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(89).\n\nSimilarly, distance between (a, b, 0) and (a, 0, c): sqrt( (0)^2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 ) = sqrt(25 + 64) = sqrt(89). Wait, no, hold on.\n\nWait, (a, b, 0) to (a, 0, c): the difference is (0, -b, c), so distance is sqrt(0 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(25 + 64) = sqrt(89). Similarly, distance between (a, b, 0) and (0, b, c) is sqrt(a\u00b2 + 0 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(16 + 64) = sqrt(80). And the distance between (a, 0, c) and (0, b, c) is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 0) = sqrt(16 +25) = sqrt(41). So yes, this setup gives all the required edge lengths. So, the four vertices are:\n\nA = (0, 0, 0),\nB = (a, b, 0) = (4,5,0),\nC = (a, 0, c) = (4, 0, 8),\nD = (0, b, c) = (0,5,8).\n\nSo, now, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron.\n\nThe volume can be calculated using the scalar triple product formula:\n\nV = |(AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD))| / 6.\n\nWait, but let me compute vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nWait, AB is from A to B: (4,5,0).\nAC is from A to C: (4,0,8).\nAD is from A to D: (0,5,8).\n\nSo, the vectors are:\n\nAB = (4,5,0),\nAC = (4,0,8),\nAD = (0,5,8).\n\nThen, the scalar triple product is AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD).\n\nFirst, compute AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nAC \u00d7 AD = |i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a08\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a05 \u00a0\u00a08\n\nSo, determinant:\n\ni*(0*8 - 8*5) - j*(4*8 - 8*0) + k*(4*5 - 0*0)\n= i*(0 - 40) - j*(32 - 0) + k*(20 - 0)\n= (-40)i -32j +20k.\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20).\n\nNow, compute AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD):\n\nAB = (4,5,0) \u00b7 (-40, -32, 20) = 4*(-40) +5*(-32) +0*20 = -160 -160 + 0 = -320.\n\nThe absolute value is 320, so volume V = 320 / 6 = 160 / 3 \u2248 53.333.\n\nSo, V = 160/3.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check the cross product.\n\nAC \u00d7 AD:\n\ni component: (0*8 - 8*5) = 0 -40 = -40.\n\nj component: -(4*8 - 8*0) = -(32 -0) = -32.\n\nk component: (4*5 -0*0) =20.\n\nYes, so cross product is (-40, -32, 20). Then AB \u00b7 that is 4*(-40) +5*(-32) +0*20 = -160 -160 = -320. Absolute value 320, so V = 320/6 = 160/3. Yep, correct.\n\nOkay, so volume is 160/3.\n\nNow, I need to find the total surface area. The tetrahedron has four triangular faces. Each pair of opposite faces are congruent because of the symmetry.\n\nSo, each face is a triangle with sides given by the edge lengths. Let me compute the area of each face.\n\nFirst, let me list the faces:\n\nFaces are ABC, ABD, ACD, and BCD.\n\nWait, actually, in the tetrahedron, each face is a triangle with edges:\n\n- Face ABC: edges AB, BC, AC.\n\n- Face ABD: edges AB, BD, AD.\n\n- Face ACD: edges AC, CD, AD.\n\n- Face BCD: edges BC, CD, BD.\n\nGiven the symmetry, each face is congruent to the opposite face.\n\nSo, for example, face ABC is congruent to face CDA, and face ABD is congruent to face BCD.\n\nWait, but let me check the edges.\n\nFace ABC: AB=\u221a41, BC=\u221a89, AC=\u221a80.\n\nFace ABD: AB=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89.\n\nFace ACD: AC=\u221a80, CD=\u221a41, AD=\u221a89.\n\nFace BCD: BC=\u221a89, CD=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80.\n\nSo, each face has sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. So, all four faces are congruent triangles. Therefore, each face has the same area, so I can compute the area once and multiply by four.\n\nSo, let's compute the area of one face, say triangle ABC with sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nWait, let me write the sides as a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nWait, to compute the area, I can use Heron's formula.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nBut Heron's formula might be messy with square roots, but perhaps there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since the triangle has sides of length \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89, I can check if it's a right triangle.\n\nLet me compute 41 + 80 = 121. 121 = 11\u00b2, which is 121. 89 is 89, which is not 121, so it's not a right triangle. Hmm, okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the area using vectors or coordinates.\n\nWait, since I have coordinates for the points, maybe I can compute the area of triangle ABC using the cross product.\n\nPoints A(0,0,0), B(4,5,0), C(4,0,8).\n\nSo, vectors AB = (4,5,0) and AC = (4,0,8).\n\nThe area is (1/2)*|AB \u00d7 AC|.\n\nCompute AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nAB \u00d7 AC = |i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04 \u00a0\u00a05 \u00a0\u00a00\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a08\n\n= i*(5*8 - 0*0) - j*(4*8 - 0*4) + k*(4*0 -5*4)\n= i*(40) - j*(32) + k*(-20)\n= (40, -32, -20).\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024).\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024): let's factor 3024.\n\n3024 \u00f7 16 = 189. So, sqrt(16*189) = 4*sqrt(189).\n\n189 factors: 9*21 = 9*3*7. So, sqrt(189) = 3*sqrt(21).\n\nSo, sqrt(3024) = 4*3*sqrt(21) = 12\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12\u221a21 = 6\u221a21.\n\nSo, each face has area 6\u221a21, and there are four faces. So, total surface area S = 4*6\u221a21 = 24\u221a21.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with Heron's formula for cross-check.\n\nUsing Heron's formula, sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2.\n\nBut that's going to be messy. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4)*sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nBut plugging in the values:\n\n(\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)(-\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)(\u221a41 - \u221a80 + \u221a89)(\u221a41 + \u221a80 - \u221a89)\n\nThat's a bit complicated, but perhaps I can compute each term.\n\nAlternatively, since I have the area from the cross product as 6\u221a21, and I can compute Heron's formula numerically to see if it's the same.\n\nCompute 6\u221a21 \u2248 6*4.5837 \u2248 27.502.\n\nNow, Heron's formula:\n\ns = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2 \u2248 (6.4031 + 8.9443 + 9.433)/2 \u2248 (24.7804)/2 \u2248 12.3902.\n\nThen, Area = sqrt( s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) )\n\nCompute s - a \u2248 12.3902 - 6.4031 \u2248 5.9871,\n\ns - b \u2248 12.3902 - 8.9443 \u2248 3.4459,\n\ns - c \u2248 12.3902 - 9.433 \u2248 2.9572.\n\nThen, product: 12.3902 *5.9871*3.4459*2.9572.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\n12.3902 *5.9871 \u2248 12.3902*6 \u2248 74.3412, but subtract 12.3902*0.0129\u22480.159, so \u224874.182.\n\nThen, 3.4459 *2.9572 \u2248 3.4459*3\u224810.3377 minus 3.4459*0.0428\u22480.1478, so \u224810.19.\n\nSo, total product \u224874.182 *10.19 \u2248 755.43.\n\nThen, sqrt(755.43) \u2248 27.49, which is approximately 27.5, which matches 6\u221a21 \u224827.502. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the area of each face is 6\u221a21, total surface area is 24\u221a21.\n\nNow, going back to the inradius formula: inradius r = 3V / S.\n\nSo, V is 160/3, S is 24\u221a21.\n\nSo, r = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160 / (24\u221a21).\n\nSimplify 160/24: both divisible by 8, so 20/3.\n\nSo, r = (20/3) / (\u221a21) = 20/(3\u221a21).\n\nRationalize the denominator: 20\u221a21 / (3*21) = 20\u221a21 / 63.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator: 20 and 63 are coprime, 21 is square-free.\n\nSo, r = (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the distance can be written as m\u221an /p, where m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. So, in this case, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nBut wait, 20 and 63: their GCD is 1, so they are coprime. Also, 21 factors into 3*7, which is square-free. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63. Then, m + n + p = 20 +21 +63= 104.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, r = 3V / S.\n\nV is 160/3.\n\nS is 24\u221a21.\n\nSo, 3*(160/3) = 160.\n\n160 divided by 24\u221a21 = (160/24)/\u221a21 = (20/3)/\u221a21 = 20/(3\u221a21) = (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the inradius is 20\u221a21 /63, so m=20, n=21, p=63. Sum is 20 +21 +63= 104.\n\nSo, the answer is 104.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the given tetrahedron $ABCD$ has opposite edges equal, which suggests it is an isosceles tetrahedron. This allows us to embed it in a rectangular box such that each edge of the tetrahedron corresponds to a face diagonal of the box.\n\nWe assign the edge lengths as face diagonals:\n- $AB = CD = \\sqrt{41}$ corresponds to $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\sqrt{41}$,\n- $AC = BD = \\sqrt{80}$ corresponds to $\\sqrt{a^2 + c^2} = \\sqrt{80}$,\n- $BC = AD = \\sqrt{89}$ corresponds to $\\sqrt{b^2 + c^2} = \\sqrt{89}$.\n\nSolving the system of equations:\n1. $a^2 + b^2 = 41$,\n2. $a^2 + c^2 = 80$,\n3. $b^2 + c^2 = 89$,\n\nwe find $a = 4$, $b = 5$, and $c = 8$. Thus, the box has dimensions $4 \\times 5 \\times 8$.\n\nThe volume $V$ of the tetrahedron is calculated using the scalar triple product of vectors from a common vertex. Assigning coordinates to the vertices, we find:\n- $A = (0, 0, 0)$,\n- $B = (4, 5, 0)$,\n- $C = (4, 0, 8)$,\n- $D = (0, 5, 8)$.\n\nVectors from $A$ are:\n- $\\vec{AB} = (4, 5, 0)$,\n- $\\vec{AC} = (4, 0, 8)$,\n- $\\vec{AD} = (0, 5, 8)$.\n\nThe cross product $\\vec{AC} \\times \\vec{AD} = (-40, -32, 20)$, and the dot product $\\vec{AB} \\cdot (\\vec{AC} \\times \\vec{AD}) = -320$. The volume is:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{6} | -320 | = \\frac{160}{3}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we compute the total surface area. Each face is a triangle with sides $\\sqrt{41}$, $\\sqrt{80}$, $\\sqrt{89}$. Using the cross product method, the area of one face is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} | \\vec{AB} \\times \\vec{AC} | = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12\\sqrt{21} = 6\\sqrt{21}.\n\\]\nThe total surface area is:\n\\[\nS = 4 \\times 6\\sqrt{21} = 24\\sqrt{21}.\n\\]\n\nThe inradius $r$ is given by:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{3V}{S} = \\frac{3 \\times \\frac{160}{3}}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{160}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}.\n\\]\nThus, $m = 20$, $n = 21$, $p = 63$, and $m + n + p = 104$.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{104}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given with specific lengths: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the faces are all equal. I need to find this distance, which can be written in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, and then compute m + n + p.\n\nHmm, first, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter in a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is called the inradius. So, I'm looking for the inradius of this tetrahedron.\n\nTo find the inradius, I think I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area. Because in a tetrahedron, the inradius r is related to the volume V and the surface area S by the formula:\n\nr = 3V / S\n\nWait, actually, is it 3V/S or something else? Let me think. In a tetrahedron, each face is a triangle, and the volume can be expressed as (1/3)*base area*height. Since all the faces are equidistant from I, the inradius, maybe the volume can be expressed as (1/3)*r*(sum of the areas of all faces). So, V = (1/3)*r*(A1 + A2 + A3 + A4), where A1, A2, A3, A4 are the areas of the four faces. Therefore, r = 3V / (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4). Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, I need to compute the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S, which is the sum of the areas of all four faces.\n\nBut wait, how do I compute the volume of a tetrahedron when I know all the edge lengths? It's not a regular tetrahedron because the edges are not all equal. So, perhaps I can use coordinates. Maybe assign coordinates to the vertices in such a way that the calculations are manageable.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the tetrahedron. Let me place vertex A at (0,0,0). Then, since the edges have certain lengths, maybe I can place other vertices in a symmetric way.\n\nWait, I notice that the edges are paired: AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD. So, the tetrahedron is \"isohedral\" in some way, maybe a kind of dual symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, so it's called an isosceles tetrahedron. I remember that in such a tetrahedron, all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, but wait, are they congruent? Let me check.\n\nGiven that AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD, so each pair of opposite edges is equal. Does that mean the faces are congruent? Let's see: each face is a triangle with sides from these edge lengths. For example, face ABC has edges AB, BC, AC. So, AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80). Similarly, face ABD has AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89). So, the sides are the same as face ABC but in a different order. So, the triangles ABC and ABD are congruent because their sides are equal.\n\nSimilarly, face ACD has AC = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41), AD = sqrt(89). So, same as the other faces. So, all four faces are congruent triangles. Therefore, each face has the same area. That's good because then the total surface area S is 4 times the area of one face.\n\nSo, maybe I can compute the area of one face and multiply by 4 for S. And for the volume, perhaps I can find it using the coordinates or another method.\n\nLet me try to compute the area of one face. Let's take triangle ABC with sides AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80). To find the area, I can use Heron's formula.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter, s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(89) + sqrt(80)) / 2.\n\nWait, that's a bit messy with square roots. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, since all faces are congruent, perhaps the volume can be computed using a formula that involves the edge lengths.\n\nWait, another approach is to realize that if all faces are congruent triangles, then the tetrahedron is isohedral, and maybe its volume can be found using the formula involving the product of edge lengths or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant. That's a method to compute the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths.\n\nThe formula for the volume V is:\n\nV = sqrt( | CM | / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for points A, B, C, D is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   AB\u00b2 AC\u00b2 AD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AB\u00b2  0   BC\u00b2 BD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AC\u00b2 BC\u00b2  0   CD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AD\u00b2 BD\u00b2 CD\u00b2  0  |\n\nSo, the determinant is a 5x5 matrix. Since the tetrahedron has six edges, and all opposite edges are equal, maybe I can assign variables to the edges.\n\nWait, let me list all the edge lengths:\n\nAB = sqrt(41) \u21d2 AB\u00b2 = 41\n\nAC = sqrt(80) \u21d2 AC\u00b2 = 80\n\nAD = sqrt(89) \u21d2 AD\u00b2 = 89\n\nBC = sqrt(89) \u21d2 BC\u00b2 = 89\n\nBD = sqrt(80) \u21d2 BD\u00b2 = 80\n\nCD = sqrt(41) \u21d2 CD\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo, the edge lengths squared are:\n\nAB\u00b2 = 41, AC\u00b2=80, AD\u00b2=89,\n\nBC\u00b2=89, BD\u00b2=80, CD\u00b2=41.\n\nSo, let's plug these into the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0    41   80   89 |\n| 1  41    0    89   80 |\n| 1  80   89    0    41 |\n| 1  89   80   41    0  |\n\nSo, I need to compute this determinant. That seems a bit involved, but let's see.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for four points in 3D space is given by:\n\nCM = determinant of the matrix:\n\n[ [0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n  [1, 0, AB\u00b2, AC\u00b2, AD\u00b2],\n  [1, AB\u00b2, 0, BC\u00b2, BD\u00b2],\n  [1, AC\u00b2, BC\u00b2, 0, CD\u00b2],\n  [1, AD\u00b2, BD\u00b2, CD\u00b2, 0] ]\n\nSo, as above, the matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nCalculating this determinant is going to be tedious, but perhaps there's some symmetry that can help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it step by step.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. Since the opposite edges are equal, maybe the determinant simplifies.\n\nWait, let me think. The determinant should be symmetric in some way because of the equal opposite edges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the volume is zero, but no, the tetrahedron is non-degenerate because all edges are positive lengths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a different approach, like placing the tetrahedron in a coordinate system.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the vertices.\n\nLet me place vertex A at (0, 0, 0).\n\nLet me place vertex B at (x, 0, 0), so that AB is along the x-axis.\n\nThen, vertex C can be placed at (a, b, 0), lying in the xy-plane.\n\nVertex D will be at some point (c, d, e), not in the xy-plane.\n\nBut this might get complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nGiven that, let's assign:\n\nA = (0, 0, 0)\n\nB = (x, 0, 0)\n\nC = (a, b, 0)\n\nD = (c, d, e)\n\nWe need to satisfy the given edge lengths.\n\nAB = sqrt(41) \u21d2 distance between A and B is sqrt(x\u00b2) = |x| = sqrt(41) \u21d2 x = sqrt(41)\n\nSo, B = (sqrt(41), 0, 0)\n\nAC = sqrt(80) \u21d2 distance between A and C is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = sqrt(80) \u21d2 a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 80\n\nAD = sqrt(89) \u21d2 distance between A and D is sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2) = sqrt(89) \u21d2 c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 = 89\n\nBC = sqrt(89) \u21d2 distance between B and C is sqrt( (a - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) = sqrt(89)\n\nSo, (a - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 89\n\nBut since a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 80, subtracting:\n\n(a - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 89 - 80 \u21d2\n\n(a\u00b2 - 2a sqrt(41) + 41) + b\u00b2 - a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 9 \u21d2\n\n-2a sqrt(41) + 41 = 9 \u21d2\n\n-2a sqrt(41) = -32 \u21d2\n\n2a sqrt(41) = 32 \u21d2\n\na = 32 / (2 sqrt(41)) = 16 / sqrt(41) = (16 sqrt(41)) / 41\n\nSo, a = (16 sqrt(41)) / 41\n\nThen, from a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 80:\n\na\u00b2 = (256 * 41) / (41\u00b2) = 256 / 41\n\nSo, 256/41 + b\u00b2 = 80 \u21d2 b\u00b2 = 80 - 256/41 = (80*41 - 256)/41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024 / 41\n\nSo, b = sqrt(3024 / 41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 \u00f7 16 = 189, so sqrt(3024) = 4*sqrt(189)\n\n189 = 9*21 = 9*3*7, so sqrt(189) = 3*sqrt(21)\n\nThus, sqrt(3024) = 4*3*sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, b = 12 sqrt(21) / sqrt(41) = (12 sqrt(21*41)) / 41\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, sqrt(3024/41) is sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41). So, sqrt(3024) is sqrt(16*189) = 4*sqrt(189) = 4*3*sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21). So, sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41) = 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41). But we can rationalize the denominator:\n\n12 sqrt(21) / sqrt(41) = 12 sqrt(21*41) / 41 = 12 sqrt(861) / 41. Hmm, but 861 factors into 3*7*41, so no square factors. So, b = 12 sqrt(861)/41.\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy, but maybe it's okay.\n\nSo, C = (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41, 0)\n\nWait, that's a bit complicated, but maybe manageable.\n\nNow, moving on to point D. We have:\n\nAD = sqrt(89) \u21d2 c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 = 89\n\nBD = sqrt(80) \u21d2 distance between B and D is sqrt( (c - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 ) = sqrt(80)\n\nSo, (c - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 = 80\n\nBut we also know that c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 = 89, so subtracting:\n\n(c - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 - (c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2) = 80 - 89 \u21d2\n\n(c\u00b2 - 2c sqrt(41) + 41) + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 - c\u00b2 - d\u00b2 - e\u00b2 = -9 \u21d2\n\n-2c sqrt(41) + 41 = -9 \u21d2\n\n-2c sqrt(41) = -50 \u21d2\n\n2c sqrt(41) = 50 \u21d2\n\nc = 50 / (2 sqrt(41)) = 25 / sqrt(41) = (25 sqrt(41)) / 41\n\nSo, c = 25 sqrt(41) / 41\n\nNow, from c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 = 89:\n\nc\u00b2 = (625 * 41) / (41\u00b2) = 625 / 41\n\nSo, 625/41 + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 = 89 \u21d2 d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 = 89 - 625/41 = (89*41 - 625)/41 = (3649 - 625)/41 = 3024 / 41\n\nSo, d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 = 3024 / 41\n\nAlso, we have CD = sqrt(41) \u21d2 distance between C and D is sqrt( (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 + e^2 ) = sqrt(41)\n\nSo, (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 + e^2 = 41\n\nWe know c = 25 sqrt(41)/41, a = 16 sqrt(41)/41, so c - a = (25 - 16) sqrt(41)/41 = 9 sqrt(41)/41\n\nSo, (c - a)^2 = (81 * 41) / (41^2) = 81 / 41\n\nThen, (d - b)^2 + e^2 = 41 - 81/41 = (41*41 - 81)/41 = (1681 - 81)/41 = 1600 / 41\n\nSo, (d - b)^2 + e^2 = 1600 / 41\n\nBut we know that d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 = 3024 / 41\n\nSo, subtracting the two equations:\n\n(d\u00b2 + e\u00b2) - [(d - b)^2 + e^2] = (3024 / 41) - (1600 / 41) \u21d2\n\nd\u00b2 - (d\u00b2 - 2db + b\u00b2) = (3024 - 1600)/41 \u21d2\n\n2db - b\u00b2 = 1424 / 41 \u21d2\n\n2db = 1424 / 41 + b\u00b2 \u21d2\n\nBut we know b\u00b2 = 3024 / 41, so:\n\n2db = 1424 / 41 + 3024 / 41 = (1424 + 3024)/41 = 4448 / 41 \u21d2\n\ndb = 4448 / (2*41) = 2224 / 41\n\nSo, db = 2224 / 41\n\nSo, d = (2224 / 41) / b\n\nBut b = 12 sqrt(861)/41, so:\n\nd = (2224 / 41) / (12 sqrt(861)/41 ) = 2224 / (12 sqrt(861)) = (556) / (3 sqrt(861)) \n\nSimplify 556 and 3: 556 \u00f7 4 = 139, 3 is prime, so no common factors. So, d = 556 / (3 sqrt(861)).\n\nWe can rationalize:\n\nd = 556 sqrt(861) / (3 * 861) = 556 sqrt(861) / 2583\n\nSimplify 556 and 2583: Let's see if 556 divides into 2583. 2583 \u00f7 556 \u2248 4.64, not an integer. So, maybe it's okay.\n\nBut this is getting really complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of computing the coordinates, I can compute the volume using Heron's formula for each face, then use the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nWait, but I'm stuck because the Cayley-Menger determinant is 5x5, which is a bit hard to compute manually. Maybe I can use some properties.\n\nAlternatively, since all faces are congruent, maybe the volume can be computed as (sqrt(2)/12) * (a*b*c), but that's for a regular tetrahedron, which this is not.\n\nWait, another thought: since opposite edges are equal, this tetrahedron is a disphenoid. In a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles, and the volume can be computed using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / (6 sqrt(2))\n\nWait, is that correct? I'm not entirely sure, but let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the volume can be found using the formula for a disphenoid:\n\nIf a disphenoid has edges a, b, c, then the volume is (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / (6 sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, but in this case, the edges are in pairs: AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So, perhaps a, b, c are the three distinct edge lengths.\n\nWait, in our case, the edge lengths are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, let me set a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this formula applies here. Let me check.\n\nWait, the formula for a disphenoid's volume is V = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / (6 sqrt(2)).\n\nBut in our case, the edges are such that each pair of opposite edges is equal. So, perhaps this is a regular disphenoid, and the formula applies.\n\nSo, let's compute:\n\nCompute (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2):\n\na\u00b2 = 41, b\u00b2 = 80, c\u00b2 = 89.\n\nSo, 41 + 80 - 89 = 32\n\nSimilarly, (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2) = 41 + 89 - 80 = 50\n\nAnd (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) = 80 + 89 - 41 = 128\n\nSo, the product is 32 * 50 * 128.\n\nCompute that: 32 * 50 = 1600; 1600 * 128 = 204800.\n\nSo, sqrt(204800) = sqrt(2048 * 100) = 10 * sqrt(2048).\n\nBut sqrt(2048) = sqrt(1024 * 2) = 32 sqrt(2). So, sqrt(204800) = 10 * 32 sqrt(2) = 320 sqrt(2).\n\nSo, the volume V is 320 sqrt(2) / (6 sqrt(2)) = 320 / 6 = 160 / 3 \u2248 53.333...\n\nWait, so V = 160/3.\n\nBut wait, let me check the formula again. Because I might have misapplied it.\n\nThe formula I found is V = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / (6 sqrt(2))\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nsqrt(32 * 50 * 128) / (6 sqrt(2)) = sqrt(204800) / (6 sqrt(2)) = 320 sqrt(2) / (6 sqrt(2)) )= 320 /6 = 160/3.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the volume is 160/3.\n\nWait, that's a relief. So, V = 160/3.\n\nNow, moving on to compute the total surface area S.\n\nSince all four faces are congruent triangles, I can compute the area of one face and multiply by 4.\n\nLet's compute the area of triangle ABC with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89).\n\nUsing Heron's formula:\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.\n\nBut that's a bit messy, so perhaps I can compute the area using vectors or another method.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the edge lengths, perhaps I can use the formula for the area in terms of side lengths:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nBut that's essentially Heron's formula.\n\nAlternatively, since I have the coordinates, maybe I can compute the area via vectors.\n\nWait, earlier, I had assigned coordinates to points A, B, C, D. Maybe I can compute the vectors for triangle ABC and compute the area.\n\nWait, point A is at (0,0,0), B is at (sqrt(41), 0, 0), and C is at (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41, 0).\n\nSo, vectors AB and AC are:\n\nAB = B - A = (sqrt(41), 0, 0)\n\nAC = C - A = (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41, 0)\n\nThe area is (1/2) the magnitude of the cross product of AB and AC.\n\nCompute the cross product AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nAB = (sqrt(41), 0, 0)\n\nAC = (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41, 0)\n\nCross product is:\n\n|i      j          k|\n|sqrt41  0          0|\n|16sqrt41/41 12sqrt861/41 0|\n\n= i*(0*0 - 0*(12sqrt861/41)) - j*(sqrt41*0 - 0*(16sqrt41/41)) + k*(sqrt41*(12sqrt861/41) - 0*(16sqrt41/41))\n\nSimplify:\n\n= i*0 - j*0 + k*( (sqrt41 * 12 sqrt861)/41 )\n\n= (0, 0, (12 sqrt(41 * 861))/41 )\n\nCompute 41 * 861:\n\n41 * 861 = 41*(800 + 60 + 1) = 41*800 + 41*60 + 41*1 = 32800 + 2460 + 41 = 35301.\n\nSo, sqrt(35301). Hmm, let's factor 35301.\n\nDivide by 3: 35301 \u00f7 3 = 11767. 11767 \u00f7 3 = 3922.333, not integer.\n\nCheck if 35301 is a square: sqrt(35301) \u2248 187.88, not an integer.\n\nWait, perhaps 35301 can be factored as 41 * 861, which we already know. So, 41*861 = 41*(800 + 60 + 1) = 32800 + 2460 +41= 35301.\n\nWait, so sqrt(41 * 861) = sqrt(41) * sqrt(861). But 861 factors into 3*7*41, so sqrt(861) = sqrt(3*7*41). So, sqrt(41 * 861) = sqrt(41)*sqrt(3*7*41) = 41 sqrt(21). Because sqrt(41^2 * 21) = 41 sqrt(21).\n\nWait, wait, let me compute sqrt(41 * 861):\n\n41 * 861 = 41*(3*7*41) = 3*7*41^2\n\nSo, sqrt(3*7*41^2) = 41 sqrt(21).\n\nYes! So, sqrt(41*861) = 41 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, the cross product's z-component is (12 * 41 sqrt(21)) / 41 = 12 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, the cross product vector is (0, 0, 12 sqrt(21)), and its magnitude is 12 sqrt(21).\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, each face has area 6 sqrt(21), and the total surface area S is 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21).\n\nWait, that's great! So, S = 24 sqrt(21).\n\nEarlier, I found that the volume V = 160/3.\n\nSo, now, the inradius r = 3V / S = 3*(160/3) / (24 sqrt(21)) = (160) / (24 sqrt(21)).\n\nSimplify 160 / 24: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 20 / 3.\n\nSo, r = (20 / 3) / sqrt(21) = 20 / (3 sqrt(21)).\n\nRationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):\n\nr = (20 sqrt(21)) / (3 * 21) = (20 sqrt(21)) / 63.\n\nSo, r = (20 sqrt(21)) / 63.\n\nSimplify the fraction: 20 and 63 are coprime, since 20 factors into 2^2*5, and 63 is 7*3^2. So, no common factors. Also, 21 is square-free (factors are 3 and 7, both primes). So, the expression is in simplest form.\n\nSo, the distance is 20 sqrt(21) / 63.\n\nThus, m = 20, n = 21, p = 63.\n\nWait, but 63 and 20 are relatively prime? 20 and 63 share no common factors besides 1, so yes.\n\nBut wait, 63 is 7*9, 20 is 2^2*5. No common factors, so yes.\n\nAnd n = 21, which factors into 3*7, both primes, so it's square-free.\n\nSo, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check my steps again because 104 seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, but in the cross product calculation, I think I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, cross product AB \u00d7 AC: AB is (sqrt(41), 0, 0), AC is (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41, 0). The cross product is (0, 0, (sqrt(41) * 12 sqrt(861)/41 - 0 * 16 sqrt(41)/41 )) = (0, 0, 12 sqrt(41*861)/41 )\n\nEarlier, I computed sqrt(41*861) as 41 sqrt(21). Let me verify:\n\n41*861 = 41*(3*7*41) = 3*7*41^2. So sqrt(3*7*41^2) = 41 sqrt(21). Correct.\n\nSo, cross product is (0,0,12 *41 sqrt(21)/41 ) = (0,0,12 sqrt(21)). So, magnitude is 12 sqrt(21). So, area is 6 sqrt(21). Correct.\n\nSo, S = 4*6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21). Correct.\n\nVolume V = 160/3. Correct.\n\nSo, r = 3V/S = (160) / (24 sqrt(21)) = (20)/(3 sqrt(21)) = 20 sqrt(21)/63. Correct.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63. So, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but the problem says the distance can be written in the form m sqrt(n)/p, where m and p are relatively prime. But 20 and 63 are relatively prime? Let me check.\n\n20 and 63: factors of 20 are 2,2,5; factors of 63 are 3,3,7. No common factors, so yes, they're coprime. So, the fraction is reduced.\n\nSo, the answer is 104.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given with specific lengths: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the faces are all equal. I need to find this distance, which can be written in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, and then compute m + n + p.\n\nHmm, first, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter in a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is called the inradius. So, I'm looking for the inradius of this tetrahedron.\n\nTo find the inradius, I think I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area. Because in a tetrahedron, the inradius r is related to the volume V and the surface area S by the formula:\n\nr = 3V / S\n\nWait, actually, is it 3V/S or something else? Let me think. In a tetrahedron, each face is a triangle, and the volume can be expressed as (1/3)*base area*height. Since all the faces are equidistant from I, the inradius, maybe the volume can be expressed as (1/3)*r*(sum of the areas of all faces). So, V = (1/3)*r*(A1 + A2 + A3 + A4), where A1, A2, A3, A4 are the areas of the four faces. Therefore, r = 3V / (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4). Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, I need to compute the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S, which is the sum of the areas of all four faces.\n\nBut wait, how do I compute the volume of a tetrahedron when I know all the edge lengths? It's not a regular tetrahedron because the edges are not all equal. So, perhaps I can use coordinates. Maybe assign coordinates to the vertices in such a way that the calculations are manageable.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the tetrahedron. Let me place vertex A at (0,0,0). Then, since the edges have certain lengths, maybe I can place other vertices in a symmetric way.\n\nWait, I notice that the edges are paired: AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD. So, the tetrahedron is \"isohedral\" in some way, maybe a kind of dual symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, so it's called an isosceles tetrahedron. I remember that in such a tetrahedron, all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, but wait, are they congruent? Let me check.\n\nGiven that AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD, so each pair of opposite edges is equal. Does that mean the faces are congruent? Let's see: each face is a triangle with sides from these edge lengths. For example, face ABC has edges AB, BC, AC. So, AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80). Similarly, face ABD has AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89). So, the sides are the same as face ABC but in a different order. So, the triangles ABC and ABD are congruent because their sides are equal.\n\nSimilarly, face ACD has AC = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41), AD = sqrt(89). So, same as the other faces. So, all four faces are congruent triangles. Therefore, each face has the same area. That's good because then the total surface area S is 4 times the area of one face.\n\nSo, maybe I can compute the area of one face and multiply by 4 for S. And for the volume, perhaps I can find it using the coordinates or another method.\n\nLet me try to compute the area of one face. Let's take triangle ABC with sides AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80). To find the area, I can use Heron's formula.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter, s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(89) + sqrt(80)) / 2.\n\nWait, that's a bit messy with square roots. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, since all faces are congruent, perhaps the volume can be computed using a formula that involves the edge lengths.\n\nWait, another approach is to realize that if all faces are congruent triangles, then the tetrahedron is isohedral, and maybe its volume can be found using the formula involving the product of edge lengths or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant. That's a method to compute the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths.\n\nThe formula for the volume V is:\n\nV = sqrt( | CM | / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for points A, B, C, D is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   AB\u00b2 AC\u00b2 AD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AB\u00b2  0   BC\u00b2 BD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AC\u00b2 BC\u00b2  0   CD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AD\u00b2 BD\u00b2 CD\u00b2  0  |\n\nSo, the determinant is a 5x5 matrix. Since the tetrahedron has six edges, and all opposite edges are equal, maybe I can assign variables to the edges.\n\nWait, let me list all the edge lengths:\n\nAB = sqrt(41) \u21d2 AB\u00b2 = 41\n\nAC = sqrt(80) \u21d2 AC\u00b2 = 80\n\nAD = sqrt(89) \u21d2 AD\u00b2 = 89\n\nBC = sqrt(89) \u21d2 BC\u00b2 = 89\n\nBD = sqrt(80) \u21d2 BD\u00b2 = 80\n\nCD = sqrt(41) \u21d2 CD\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo, the edge lengths squared are:\n\nAB\u00b2 = 41, AC\u00b2=80, AD\u00b2=89,\n\nBC\u00b2=89, BD\u00b2=80, CD\u00b2=41.\n\nSo, let's plug these into the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0    41   80   89 |\n| 1  41    0    89   80 |\n| 1  80   89    0    41 |\n| 1  89   80   41    0  |\n\nSo, I need to compute this determinant. That seems a bit involved, but let's see.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for four points in 3D space is given by:\n\nCM = determinant of the matrix:\n\n[ [0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n  [1, 0, AB\u00b2, AC\u00b2, AD\u00b2],\n  [1, AB\u00b2, 0, BC\u00b2, BD\u00b2],\n  [1, AC\u00b2, BC\u00b2, 0, CD\u00b2],\n  [1, AD\u00b2, BD\u00b2, CD\u00b2, 0] ]\n\nSo, as above, the matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nCalculating this determinant is going to be tedious, but perhaps there's some symmetry that can help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it step by step.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. Since the opposite edges are equal, maybe the determinant simplifies.\n\nWait, let me think. The determinant should be symmetric in some way because of the equal opposite edges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the volume is zero, but no, the tetrahedron is non-degenerate because all edges are positive lengths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a different approach, like placing the tetrahedron in a coordinate system.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the vertices.\n\nLet me place vertex A at (0, 0, 0).\n\nLet me place vertex B at (x, 0, 0), so that AB is along the x-axis.\n\nThen, vertex C can be placed at (a, b, 0), lying in the xy-plane.\n\nVertex D will be at some point (c, d, e), not in the xy-plane.\n\nBut this might get complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nGiven that, let's assign:\n\nA = (0, 0, 0)\n\nB = (x, 0, 0)\n\nC = (a, b, 0)\n\nD = (c, d, e)\n\nWe need to satisfy the given edge lengths.\n\nAB = sqrt(41) \u21d2 distance between A and B is sqrt(x\u00b2) = |x| = sqrt(41) \u21d2 x = sqrt(41)\n\nSo, B = (sqrt(41), 0, 0)\n\nAC = sqrt(80) \u21d2 distance between A and C is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = sqrt(80) \u21d2 a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 80\n\nAD = sqrt(89) \u21d2 distance between A and D is sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2) = sqrt(89) \u21d2 c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 = 89\n\nBC = sqrt(89) \u21d2 distance between B and C is sqrt( (a - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) = sqrt(89)\n\nSo, (a - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 89\n\nBut since a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 80, subtracting:\n\n(a - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 89 - 80 \u21d2\n\n(a\u00b2 - 2a sqrt(41) + 41) + b\u00b2 - a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 9 \u21d2\n\n-2a sqrt(41) + 41 = 9 \u21d2\n\n-2a sqrt(41) = -32 \u21d2\n\n2a sqrt(41) = 32 \u21d2\n\na = 32 / (2 sqrt(41)) = 16 / sqrt(41) = (16 sqrt(41)) / 41\n\nSo, a = (16 sqrt(41)) / 41\n\nThen, from a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 80:\n\na\u00b2 = (256 * 41) / (41\u00b2) = 256 / 41\n\nSo, 256/41 + b\u00b2 = 80 \u21d2 b\u00b2 = 80 - 256/41 = (80*41 - 256)/41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024 / 41\n\nSo, b = sqrt(3024 / 41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 \u00f7 16 = 189, so sqrt(3024) = 4*sqrt(189)\n\n189 = 9*21 = 9*3*7, so sqrt(189) = 3*sqrt(21)\n\nThus, sqrt(3024) = 4*3*sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, b = 12 sqrt(21) / sqrt(41) = (12 sqrt(21*41)) / 41\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, sqrt(3024/41) is sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41). So, sqrt(3024) is sqrt(16*189) = 4*sqrt(189) = 4*3*sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21). So, sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41) = 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41). But we can rationalize the denominator:\n\n12 sqrt(21) / sqrt(41) = 12 sqrt(21*41) / 41 = 12 sqrt(861) / 41. Hmm, but 861 factors into 3*7*41, so no square factors. So, b = 12 sqrt(861)/41.\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy, but maybe it's okay.\n\nSo, C = (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41, 0)\n\nWait, that's a bit complicated, but maybe manageable.\n\nNow, moving on to point D. We have:\n\nAD = sqrt(89) \u21d2 c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 = 89\n\nBD = sqrt(80) \u21d2 distance between B and D is sqrt( (c - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 ) = sqrt(80)\n\nSo, (c - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 = 80\n\nBut we also know that c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 = 89, so subtracting:\n\n(c - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 - (c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2) = 80 - 89 \u21d2\n\n(c\u00b2 - 2c sqrt(41) + 41) + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 - c\u00b2 - d\u00b2 - e\u00b2 = -9 \u21d2\n\n-2c sqrt(41) + 41 = -9 \u21d2\n\n-2c sqrt(41) = -50 \u21d2\n\n2c sqrt(41) = 50 \u21d2\n\nc = 50 / (2 sqrt(41)) = 25 / sqrt(41) = (25 sqrt(41)) / 41\n\nSo, c = 25 sqrt(41) / 41\n\nNow, from c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 = 89:\n\nc\u00b2 = (625 * 41) / (41\u00b2) = 625 / 41\n\nSo, 625/41 + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 = 89 \u21d2 d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 = 89 - 625/41 = (89*41 - 625)/41 = (3649 - 625)/41 = 3024 / 41\n\nSo, d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 = 3024 / 41\n\nAlso, we have CD = sqrt(41) \u21d2 distance between C and D is sqrt( (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 + e^2 ) = sqrt(41)\n\nSo, (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 + e^2 = 41\n\nWe know c = 25 sqrt(41)/41, a = 16 sqrt(41)/41, so c - a = (25 - 16) sqrt(41)/41 = 9 sqrt(41)/41\n\nSo, (c - a)^2 = (81 * 41) / (41^2) = 81 / 41\n\nThen, (d - b)^2 + e^2 = 41 - 81/41 = (41*41 - 81)/41 = (1681 - 81)/41 = 1600 / 41\n\nSo, (d - b)^2 + e^2 = 1600 / 41\n\nBut we know that d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 = 3024 / 41\n\nSo, subtracting the two equations:\n\n(d\u00b2 + e\u00b2) - [(d - b)^2 + e^2] = (3024 / 41) - (1600 / 41) \u21d2\n\nd\u00b2 - (d\u00b2 - 2db + b\u00b2) = (3024 - 1600)/41 \u21d2\n\n2db - b\u00b2 = 1424 / 41 \u21d2\n\n2db = 1424 / 41 + b\u00b2 \u21d2\n\nBut we know b\u00b2 = 3024 / 41, so:\n\n2db = 1424 / 41 + 3024 / 41 = (1424 + 3024)/41 = 4448 / 41 \u21d2\n\ndb = 4448 / (2*41) = 2224 / 41\n\nSo, db = 2224 / 41\n\nSo, d = (2224 / 41) / b\n\nBut b = 12 sqrt(861)/41, so:\n\nd = (2224 / 41) / (12 sqrt(861)/41 ) = 2224 / (12 sqrt(861)) = (556) / (3 sqrt(861)) \n\nSimplify 556 and 3: 556 \u00f7 4 = 139, 3 is prime, so no common factors. So, d = 556 / (3 sqrt(861)).\n\nWe can rationalize:\n\nd = 556 sqrt(861) / (3 * 861) = 556 sqrt(861) / 2583\n\nSimplify 556 and 2583: Let's see if 556 divides into 2583. 2583 \u00f7 556 \u2248 4.64, not an integer. So, maybe it's okay.\n\nBut this is getting really complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of computing the coordinates, I can compute the volume using Heron's formula for each face, then use the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nWait, but I'm stuck because the Cayley-Menger determinant is 5x5, which is a bit hard to compute manually. Maybe I can use some properties.\n\nAlternatively, since all faces are congruent, maybe the volume can be computed as (sqrt(2)/12) * (a*b*c), but that's for a regular tetrahedron, which this is not.\n\nWait, another thought: since opposite edges are equal, this tetrahedron is a disphenoid. In a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles, and the volume can be computed using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / (6 sqrt(2))\n\nWait, is that correct? I'm not entirely sure, but let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the volume can be found using the formula for a disphenoid:\n\nIf a disphenoid has edges a, b, c, then the volume is (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / (6 sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, but in this case, the edges are in pairs: AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So, perhaps a, b, c are the three distinct edge lengths.\n\nWait, in our case, the edge lengths are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, let me set a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this formula applies here. Let me check.\n\nWait, the formula for a disphenoid's volume is V = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / (6 sqrt(2)).\n\nBut in our case, the edges are such that each pair of opposite edges is equal. So, perhaps this is a regular disphenoid, and the formula applies.\n\nSo, let's compute:\n\nCompute (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2):\n\na\u00b2 = 41, b\u00b2 = 80, c\u00b2 = 89.\n\nSo, 41 + 80 - 89 = 32\n\nSimilarly, (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2) = 41 + 89 - 80 = 50\n\nAnd (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) = 80 + 89 - 41 = 128\n\nSo, the product is 32 * 50 * 128.\n\nCompute that: 32 * 50 = 1600; 1600 * 128 = 204800.\n\nSo, sqrt(204800) = sqrt(2048 * 100) = 10 * sqrt(2048).\n\nBut sqrt(2048) = sqrt(1024 * 2) = 32 sqrt(2). So, sqrt(204800) = 10 * 32 sqrt(2) = 320 sqrt(2).\n\nSo, the volume V is 320 sqrt(2) / (6 sqrt(2)) = 320 / 6 = 160 / 3 \u2248 53.333...\n\nWait, so V = 160/3.\n\nBut wait, let me check the formula again. Because I might have misapplied it.\n\nThe formula I found is V = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / (6 sqrt(2))\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nsqrt(32 * 50 * 128) / (6 sqrt(2)) = sqrt(204800) / (6 sqrt(2)) = 320 sqrt(2) / (6 sqrt(2)) )= 320 /6 = 160/3.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the volume is 160/3.\n\nWait, that's a relief. So, V = 160/3.\n\nNow, moving on to compute the total surface area S.\n\nSince all four faces are congruent triangles, I can compute the area of one face and multiply by 4.\n\nLet's compute the area of triangle ABC with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89).\n\nUsing Heron's formula:\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.\n\nBut that's a bit messy, so perhaps I can compute the area using vectors or another method.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the edge lengths, perhaps I can use the formula for the area in terms of side lengths:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nBut that's essentially Heron's formula.\n\nAlternatively, since I have the coordinates, maybe I can compute the area via vectors.\n\nWait, earlier, I had assigned coordinates to points A, B, C, D. Maybe I can compute the vectors for triangle ABC and compute the area.\n\nWait, point A is at (0,0,0), B is at (sqrt(41), 0, 0), and C is at (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41, 0).\n\nSo, vectors AB and AC are:\n\nAB = B - A = (sqrt(41), 0, 0)\n\nAC = C - A = (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41, 0)\n\nThe area is (1/2) the magnitude of the cross product of AB and AC.\n\nCompute the cross product AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nAB = (sqrt(41), 0, 0)\n\nAC = (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41, 0)\n\nCross product is:\n\n|i      j          k|\n|sqrt41  0          0|\n|16sqrt41/41 12sqrt861/41 0|\n\n= i*(0*0 - 0*(12sqrt861/41)) - j*(sqrt41*0 - 0*(16sqrt41/41)) + k*(sqrt41*(12sqrt861/41) - 0*(16sqrt41/41))\n\nSimplify:\n\n= i*0 - j*0 + k*( (sqrt41 * 12 sqrt861)/41 )\n\n= (0, 0, (12 sqrt(41 * 861))/41 )\n\nCompute 41 * 861:\n\n41 * 861 = 41*(800 + 60 + 1) = 41*800 + 41*60 + 41*1 = 32800 + 2460 + 41 = 35301.\n\nSo, sqrt(35301). Hmm, let's factor 35301.\n\nDivide by 3: 35301 \u00f7 3 = 11767. 11767 \u00f7 3 = 3922.333, not integer.\n\nCheck if 35301 is a square: sqrt(35301) \u2248 187.88, not an integer.\n\nWait, perhaps 35301 can be factored as 41 * 861, which we already know. So, 41*861 = 41*(800 + 60 + 1) = 32800 + 2460 +41= 35301.\n\nWait, so sqrt(41 * 861) = sqrt(41) * sqrt(861). But 861 factors into 3*7*41, so sqrt(861) = sqrt(3*7*41). So, sqrt(41 * 861) = sqrt(41)*sqrt(3*7*41) = 41 sqrt(21). Because sqrt(41^2 * 21) = 41 sqrt(21).\n\nWait, wait, let me compute sqrt(41 * 861):\n\n41 * 861 = 41*(3*7*41) = 3*7*41^2\n\nSo, sqrt(3*7*41^2) = 41 sqrt(21).\n\nYes! So, sqrt(41*861) = 41 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, the cross product's z-component is (12 * 41 sqrt(21)) / 41 = 12 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, the cross product vector is (0, 0, 12 sqrt(21)), and its magnitude is 12 sqrt(21).\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, each face has area 6 sqrt(21), and the total surface area S is 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21).\n\nWait, that's great! So, S = 24 sqrt(21).\n\nEarlier, I found that the volume V = 160/3.\n\nSo, now, the inradius r = 3V / S = 3*(160/3) / (24 sqrt(21)) = (160) / (24 sqrt(21)).\n\nSimplify 160 / 24: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 20 / 3.\n\nSo, r = (20 / 3) / sqrt(21) = 20 / (3 sqrt(21)).\n\nRationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):\n\nr = (20 sqrt(21)) / (3 * 21) = (20 sqrt(21)) / 63.\n\nSo, r = (20 sqrt(21)) / 63.\n\nSimplify the fraction: 20 and 63 are coprime, since 20 factors into 2^2*5, and 63 is 7*3^2. So, no common factors. Also, 21 is square-free (factors are 3 and 7, both primes). So, the expression is in simplest form.\n\nSo, the distance is 20 sqrt(21) / 63.\n\nThus, m = 20, n = 21, p = 63.\n\nWait, but 63 and 20 are relatively prime? 20 and 63 share no common factors besides 1, so yes.\n\nBut wait, 63 is 7*9, 20 is 2^2*5. No common factors, so yes.\n\nAnd n = 21, which factors into 3*7, both primes, so it's square-free.\n\nSo, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check my steps again because 104 seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, but in the cross product calculation, I think I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, cross product AB \u00d7 AC: AB is (sqrt(41), 0, 0), AC is (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41, 0). The cross product is (0, 0, (sqrt(41) * 12 sqrt(861)/41 - 0 * 16 sqrt(41)/41 )) = (0, 0, 12 sqrt(41*861)/41 )\n\nEarlier, I computed sqrt(41*861) as 41 sqrt(21). Let me verify:\n\n41*861 = 41*(3*7*41) = 3*7*41^2. So sqrt(3*7*41^2) = 41 sqrt(21). Correct.\n\nSo, cross product is (0,0,12 *41 sqrt(21)/41 ) = (0,0,12 sqrt(21)). So, magnitude is 12 sqrt(21). So, area is 6 sqrt(21). Correct.\n\nSo, S = 4*6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21). Correct.\n\nVolume V = 160/3. Correct.\n\nSo, r = 3V/S = (160) / (24 sqrt(21)) = (20)/(3 sqrt(21)) = 20 sqrt(21)/63. Correct.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63. So, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but the problem says the distance can be written in the form m sqrt(n)/p, where m and p are relatively prime. But 20 and 63 are relatively prime? Let me check.\n\n20 and 63: factors of 20 are 2,2,5; factors of 63 are 3,3,7. No common factors, so yes, they're coprime. So, the fraction is reduced.\n\nSo, the answer is 104.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we recognize that the tetrahedron is isohedral, meaning all its faces are congruent triangles. We use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume \\( V \\) and Heron's formula to find the total surface area \\( S \\).\n\n### Step 1: Compute the Volume \\( V \\)\nUsing the Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths \\( AB = CD = \\sqrt{41} \\), \\( AC = BD = \\sqrt{80} \\), and \\( BC = AD = \\sqrt{89} \\), we find the volume \\( V \\) to be:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{160}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Total Surface Area \\( S \\)\nEach face is a congruent triangle with sides \\( \\sqrt{41} \\), \\( \\sqrt{80} \\), and \\( \\sqrt{89} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance is supposed to be in the form m\u221an/p, and then I have to find m + n + p. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given edge lengths:\n\n- AB = CD = \u221a41\n- AC = BD = \u221a80\n- BC = AD = \u221a89\n\nSo, all opposite edges are equal. That seems symmetric in some way. Maybe this is a kind of isosceles tetrahedron? I think that's when all opposite edges are equal. So, perhaps this tetrahedron has some nice properties because of this symmetry.\n\nI remember that in an isosceles tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using a formula similar to the inradius of a triangle, which is 3 times the volume divided by the surface area. Wait, for a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius (r) is 3 times the volume (V) divided by the total surface area (A). So, r = 3V / A.\n\nSo, I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area. Then, I can compute r.\n\nLet me start by trying to find the volume. To find the volume of a tetrahedron, I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant, which is a formula that uses the lengths of all edges to compute the volume. But that might be complicated because it's a 4x4 determinant. Alternatively, maybe I can find coordinates for the points and compute the volume using the scalar triple product.\n\nSince the tetrahedron is symmetric, maybe I can place it in a coordinate system in a way that makes calculations easier. Let me think about how to assign coordinates to the vertices.\n\nLet me denote the points as A, B, C, D. Let's try to position them in 3D space such that the coordinates are symmetric.\n\nI remember that in an isosceles tetrahedron, the opposite edges are equal, and the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system where the coordinates are symmetric. Maybe I can set the points such that:\n\n- A is at (x, y, z)\n- B is at (-x, -y, z)\n- C is at (-x, y, -z)\n- D is at (x, -y, -z)\n\nThis kind of symmetry might work because it makes opposite edges equal. Let me see.\n\nSo, let's compute the distances between these points.\n\nDistance AB: between (x, y, z) and (-x, -y, z). Using distance formula:\n\nAB\u00b2 = (x - (-x))\u00b2 + (y - (-y))\u00b2 + (z - z)\u00b2 = (2x)\u00b2 + (2y)\u00b2 + 0 = 4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2.\n\nGiven AB = \u221a41, so AB\u00b2 = 41. So:\n\n4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2 = 41 \u2192 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4. (1)\n\nSimilarly, let's compute AC: between (x, y, z) and (-x, y, -z).\n\nAC\u00b2 = (x - (-x))\u00b2 + (y - y)\u00b2 + (z - (-z))\u00b2 = (2x)\u00b2 + 0 + (2z)^2 = 4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2.\n\nGiven AC = \u221a80, so AC\u00b2 = 80:\n\n4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2 = 80 \u2192 x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20. (2)\n\nNow, let's compute AD: between (x, y, z) and (x, -y, -z).\n\nAD\u00b2 = (x - x)^2 + (y - (-y))^2 + (z - (-z))^2 = 0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 = 4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2.\n\nGiven AD = \u221a89, so AD\u00b2 = 89:\n\n4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2 = 89 \u2192 y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4. (3)\n\nSo now, I have three equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n2. x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\n3. y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nI can solve these equations to find x\u00b2, y\u00b2, z\u00b2.\n\nLet me subtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4 \u2192 z\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = (80/4 - 41/4) = 39/4.\n\nFrom equation (3): y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo, I have:\n\nz\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 39/4\n\nz\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\n2z\u00b2 = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32 \u2192 z\u00b2 = 16 \u2192 z = 4 or z = -4. Since it's a coordinate, I can take z = 4.\n\nSubtracting the two equations:\n\n2y\u00b2 = (89 - 39)/4 = 50/4 = 25/2 \u2192 y\u00b2 = 25/4 \u2192 y = 5/2 or y = -5/2.\n\nFrom equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4. Since y\u00b2 = 25/4, x\u00b2 = (41/4) - (25/4) = 16/4 = 4 \u2192 x = 2 or x = -2.\n\nSo, the coordinates are:\n\nA: (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB: (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC: (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nD: (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nWait, let me check. If A is (x, y, z) = (2, 5/2, 4), then B is (-2, -5/2, 4), C is (-2, 5/2, -4), and D is (2, -5/2, -4). Hmm, that looks consistent.\n\nNow, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume using the scalar triple product. The volume is (1/6) times the absolute value of the scalar triple product of vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the volume using the coordinates.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a tetrahedron given coordinates of its four vertices is:\n\nV = |det(B - A, C - A, D - A)| / 6\n\nSo, let's compute vectors BA, CA, DA.\n\nWait, actually, vectors from A to B, A to C, A to D.\n\nWait, no, the vectors should be from the same vertex. Let me take A as the origin for vectors, so vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nWait, but AB is from A to B, which is B - A.\n\nSo, vectors AB = B - A, AC = C - A, AD = D - A.\n\nSo, vectors AB, AC, AD are:\n\nAB = (-2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, 4 - 4) = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-2 - 2, 5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (0, -5, -8)\n\nSo, the vectors AB, AC, AD are:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nNow, the scalar triple product is AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD).\n\nFirst, let me compute the cross product AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nCross product formula:\n\nIf vector u = (u1, u2, u3), v = (v1, v2, v3), then\n\nu \u00d7 v = (u2v3 - u3v2, u3v1 - u1v3, u1v2 - u2v1)\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD:\n\nFirst component: (0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) = 0 - (40) = -40\n\nSecond component: (-8)*0 - (-4)*(-8) = 0 - 32 = -32\n\nThird component: (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 = 20\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nWait, actually, the cross product is:\n\ni component: (AC_y * AD_z - AC_z * AD_y) = (0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) = 0 - 40 = -40\n\nj component: (AC_z * AD_x - AC_x * AD_z) = (-8)*0 - (-4)*(-8) = 0 - 32 = -32\n\nk component: (AC_x * AD_y - AC_y * AD_x) = (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 = 20\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nNow, compute AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD):\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nDot product:\n\n(-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*(20) = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320\n\nSo, the scalar triple product is 320. Therefore, the volume V is |320| / 6 = 320/6 = 160/3.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me see. The absolute value is 320, so 320 divided by 6 is indeed 160/3. So, V = 160/3.\n\nHmm, but wait, I have a feeling that the volume might be larger because the edge lengths are around sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), which are all relatively large. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the cross product. Let me recompute AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nCross product:\n\ni: AC_y * AD_z - AC_z * AD_y = 0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5) = 0 - 40 = -40\n\nj: AC_z * AD_x - AC_x * AD_z = (-8)*0 - (-4)*(-8) = 0 - 32 = -32\n\nk: AC_x * AD_y - AC_y * AD_x = (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 = 20\n\nSo, cross product is (-40, -32, 20). That seems correct.\n\nThen, AB is (-4, -5, 0). Dot product with (-40, -32, 20):\n\n(-4)*(-40) = 160\n\n(-5)*(-32) = 160\n\n0*20 = 0\n\nTotal is 320. So, V = 320 / 6 = 160/3. Hmm, that seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the volume another way to check.\n\nWait, another approach: since all opposite edges are equal, the tetrahedron is isohedral? Or maybe it's a disphenoid. A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, which is the case here.\n\nFor a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / 72\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm confusing it with another formula. Alternatively, for a disphenoid, the volume is sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / 72, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should look for another formula.\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates, perhaps we can compute the volume using the determinant method, which I already did. So, perhaps 160/3 is correct.\n\nWait, let me think about the edges again. The edges are AB=\u221a41, AC=\u221a80, BC=\u221a89, etc. So, all the edges are sqrt of numbers that are 41, 80, 89. So, the volume is 160/3? Hmm, maybe. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the total surface area of the tetrahedron. Since it's a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles? Wait, no, in a disphenoid, opposite faces are congruent, but not necessarily all four.\n\nWait, let me check: in a disphenoid, there are two pairs of congruent triangles. So, in our case, maybe the faces ABC and ADC are congruent, and faces ABD and BCD are congruent. Alternatively, perhaps each pair of opposite faces is congruent.\n\nBut in any case, maybe it's easier to compute the area of one face and multiply by four? Wait, no, because in a disphenoid, opposite faces are congruent, but not all four faces are necessarily congruent.\n\nWait, let's compute the areas of the four faces.\n\nGiven the edge lengths, each face is a triangle with sides of length sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Wait, is that the case?\n\nWait, let's take face ABC. The edges are AB=\u221a41, BC=\u221a89, and AC=\u221a80. So, each face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89.\n\nSo, all four faces are congruent triangles, each with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. That's helpful because then the surface area is 4 times the area of one such triangle.\n\nSo, let's compute the area of triangle ABC with sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nWe can use Heron's formula for the area. Heron's formula says that the area is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nFirst, compute s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nCompute a + b + c: \u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89.\n\nWait, but that's a bit messy. Alternatively, since the sides are \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89, maybe we can compute s\u00b2 and so on, but perhaps it's better to compute numerically.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better approach. Alternatively, since the triangle has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), perhaps it's a right triangle? Let me check.\n\nCheck if 41 + 80 = 89. 41 + 80 = 121, and 89 is less than that. So, no, not a right triangle. Alternatively, maybe 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11\u00b2, but 89 is not 11\u00b2, so it's not a right triangle.\n\nHmm, okay, so we have to compute the area using Heron's formula.\n\nLet me compute s:\n\ns = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2\n\nBut this is complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the area using the formula (1/4)\u221a[(a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)], but that's Heron's formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can compute the area using vectors or coordinates.\n\nWait, since we have the coordinates of the points, perhaps it's easier to compute the area of one face using vectors.\n\nLet me compute the area of triangle ABC. Points A, B, C:\n\nA: (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB: (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC: (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nSo, vectors AB and AC can be used to compute the area.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute vectors AB, AC, and then compute the cross product.\n\nWait, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2) the magnitude of the cross product of vectors AB and AC.\n\nWait, but AB and AC are vectors from point A to B and A to C. So, vectors AB = B - A, AC = C - A.\n\nCompute vectors AB and AC:\n\nAB = B - A = (-2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, 4 - 4) = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = C - A = (-2 - 2, 5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nSo, vectors AB = (-4, -5, 0), AC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCompute the cross product AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nUsing the cross product formula:\n\ni component: AB_y * AC_z - AB_z * AC_y = (-5)*(-8) - 0*0 = 40 - 0 = 40\n\nj component: AB_z * AC_x - AB_x * AC_z = 0*(-4) - (-4)*(-8) = 0 - 32 = -32\n\nk component: AB_x * AC_y - AB_y * AC_x = (-4)*0 - (-5)*(-4) = 0 - 20 = -20\n\nSo, AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)\u00b2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 \u00f7 16 = 189. So, sqrt(16*189) = 4*sqrt(189)\n\n189 = 9 * 21 = 9 * 3 * 7. So, sqrt(189) = 3*sqrt(21)\n\nThus, the magnitude is 4*3*sqrt(21) = 12*sqrt(21)\n\nSo, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12*sqrt(21) = 6*sqrt(21)\n\nTherefore, each face has an area of 6\u221a21, and there are four faces, so the total surface area A is 4 * 6\u221a21 = 24\u221a21.\n\nWait, that seems manageable. So, surface area A = 24\u221a21.\n\nEarlier, I found the volume V = 160/3.\n\nSo, the inradius r is 3V / A = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160 / (24\u221a21) = (160)/(24\u221a21)\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8: 20 / (3\u221a21)\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21:\n\n(20\u221a21) / (3*21) = (20\u221a21)/(63)\n\nSo, the inradius r is (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nNow, the problem states that the distance is in the form m\u221an/p, where m and p are coprime, and n is square-free.\n\nLooking at (20\u221a21)/63, let's see if 20 and 63 have any common factors. 20 factors into 2\u00b2 *5, and 63 is 7*3\u00b2. No common factors, so m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nWait, but wait, 21 is 3*7, which is square-free, so that's good.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63. Therefore, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because 104 seems a bit high, but maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, let me recap:\n\n- I found the coordinates correctly, leading to vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\n- Calculated the scalar triple product correctly, giving volume 160/3.\n\n- Calculated the area of one face using cross product, getting 6\u221a21.\n\n- Since all faces are congruent, total surface area is 4*6\u221a21 = 24\u221a21.\n\n- Then, inradius r = 3V / A = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160/(24\u221a21) = 20/(3\u221a21) = (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me confirm the calculation of the cross product for the area.\n\nEarlier, I computed AB \u00d7 AC as (40, -32, -20), whose magnitude is sqrt(40\u00b2 + 32\u00b2 + 20\u00b2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024). But 3024 is 16 * 189, as I thought. Then, 189 is 9 * 21, so sqrt(189) is 3\u221a21. So, 4 * 3\u221a21 is 12\u221a21. Then, half of that is 6\u221a21. So that's correct.\n\nYes, so the area of each face is 6\u221a21, so four faces make 24\u221a21. Volume is 160/3.\n\nSo, r = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160 / (24\u221a21) = (160 \u00f7 8) / (24 \u00f7 8 * \u221a21) )= 20 / (3\u221a21). Rationalizing gives (20\u221a21)/(63).\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63. m and p are coprime because 20 and 63 share no common factors besides 1. n=21 is square-free because 21 factors into 3 and 7, both primes.\n\nSo, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but 63 is 7 * 3\u00b2. Wait, but in the formula, the denominator is 63, which is 7*9. So, the answer is 20\u221a21/63, so m=20, n=21, p=63. Thus, sum is 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer is 104.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance is supposed to be in the form m\u221an/p, and then I have to find m + n + p. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given edge lengths:\n\n- AB = CD = \u221a41\n- AC = BD = \u221a80\n- BC = AD = \u221a89\n\nSo, all opposite edges are equal. That seems symmetric in some way. Maybe this is a kind of isosceles tetrahedron? I think that's when all opposite edges are equal. So, perhaps this tetrahedron has some nice properties because of this symmetry.\n\nI remember that in an isosceles tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using a formula similar to the inradius of a triangle, which is 3 times the volume divided by the surface area. Wait, for a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius (r) is 3 times the volume (V) divided by the total surface area (A). So, r = 3V / A.\n\nSo, I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area. Then, I can compute r.\n\nLet me start by trying to find the volume. To find the volume of a tetrahedron, I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant, which is a formula that uses the lengths of all edges to compute the volume. But that might be complicated because it's a 4x4 determinant. Alternatively, maybe I can find coordinates for the points and compute the volume using the scalar triple product.\n\nSince the tetrahedron is symmetric, maybe I can place it in a coordinate system in a way that makes calculations easier. Let me think about how to assign coordinates to the vertices.\n\nLet me denote the points as A, B, C, D. Let's try to position them in 3D space such that the coordinates are symmetric.\n\nI remember that in an isosceles tetrahedron, the opposite edges are equal, and the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system where the coordinates are symmetric. Maybe I can set the points such that:\n\n- A is at (x, y, z)\n- B is at (-x, -y, z)\n- C is at (-x, y, -z)\n- D is at (x, -y, -z)\n\nThis kind of symmetry might work because it makes opposite edges equal. Let me see.\n\nSo, let's compute the distances between these points.\n\nDistance AB: between (x, y, z) and (-x, -y, z). Using distance formula:\n\nAB\u00b2 = (x - (-x))\u00b2 + (y - (-y))\u00b2 + (z - z)\u00b2 = (2x)\u00b2 + (2y)\u00b2 + 0 = 4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2.\n\nGiven AB = \u221a41, so AB\u00b2 = 41. So:\n\n4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2 = 41 \u2192 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4. (1)\n\nSimilarly, let's compute AC: between (x, y, z) and (-x, y, -z).\n\nAC\u00b2 = (x - (-x))\u00b2 + (y - y)\u00b2 + (z - (-z))\u00b2 = (2x)\u00b2 + 0 + (2z)^2 = 4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2.\n\nGiven AC = \u221a80, so AC\u00b2 = 80:\n\n4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2 = 80 \u2192 x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20. (2)\n\nNow, let's compute AD: between (x, y, z) and (x, -y, -z).\n\nAD\u00b2 = (x - x)^2 + (y - (-y))^2 + (z - (-z))^2 = 0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 = 4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2.\n\nGiven AD = \u221a89, so AD\u00b2 = 89:\n\n4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2 = 89 \u2192 y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4. (3)\n\nSo now, I have three equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n2. x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\n3. y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nI can solve these equations to find x\u00b2, y\u00b2, z\u00b2.\n\nLet me subtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4 \u2192 z\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = (80/4 - 41/4) = 39/4.\n\nFrom equation (3): y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo, I have:\n\nz\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 39/4\n\nz\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\n2z\u00b2 = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32 \u2192 z\u00b2 = 16 \u2192 z = 4 or z = -4. Since it's a coordinate, I can take z = 4.\n\nSubtracting the two equations:\n\n2y\u00b2 = (89 - 39)/4 = 50/4 = 25/2 \u2192 y\u00b2 = 25/4 \u2192 y = 5/2 or y = -5/2.\n\nFrom equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4. Since y\u00b2 = 25/4, x\u00b2 = (41/4) - (25/4) = 16/4 = 4 \u2192 x = 2 or x = -2.\n\nSo, the coordinates are:\n\nA: (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB: (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC: (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nD: (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nWait, let me check. If A is (x, y, z) = (2, 5/2, 4), then B is (-2, -5/2, 4), C is (-2, 5/2, -4), and D is (2, -5/2, -4). Hmm, that looks consistent.\n\nNow, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume using the scalar triple product. The volume is (1/6) times the absolute value of the scalar triple product of vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the volume using the coordinates.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a tetrahedron given coordinates of its four vertices is:\n\nV = |det(B - A, C - A, D - A)| / 6\n\nSo, let's compute vectors BA, CA, DA.\n\nWait, actually, vectors from A to B, A to C, A to D.\n\nWait, no, the vectors should be from the same vertex. Let me take A as the origin for vectors, so vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nWait, but AB is from A to B, which is B - A.\n\nSo, vectors AB = B - A, AC = C - A, AD = D - A.\n\nSo, vectors AB, AC, AD are:\n\nAB = (-2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, 4 - 4) = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-2 - 2, 5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (0, -5, -8)\n\nSo, the vectors AB, AC, AD are:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nNow, the scalar triple product is AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD).\n\nFirst, let me compute the cross product AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nCross product formula:\n\nIf vector u = (u1, u2, u3), v = (v1, v2, v3), then\n\nu \u00d7 v = (u2v3 - u3v2, u3v1 - u1v3, u1v2 - u2v1)\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD:\n\nFirst component: (0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) = 0 - (40) = -40\n\nSecond component: (-8)*0 - (-4)*(-8) = 0 - 32 = -32\n\nThird component: (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 = 20\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nWait, actually, the cross product is:\n\ni component: (AC_y * AD_z - AC_z * AD_y) = (0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) = 0 - 40 = -40\n\nj component: (AC_z * AD_x - AC_x * AD_z) = (-8)*0 - (-4)*(-8) = 0 - 32 = -32\n\nk component: (AC_x * AD_y - AC_y * AD_x) = (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 = 20\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nNow, compute AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD):\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nDot product:\n\n(-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*(20) = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320\n\nSo, the scalar triple product is 320. Therefore, the volume V is |320| / 6 = 320/6 = 160/3.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me see. The absolute value is 320, so 320 divided by 6 is indeed 160/3. So, V = 160/3.\n\nHmm, but wait, I have a feeling that the volume might be larger because the edge lengths are around sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), which are all relatively large. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the cross product. Let me recompute AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nCross product:\n\ni: AC_y * AD_z - AC_z * AD_y = 0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5) = 0 - 40 = -40\n\nj: AC_z * AD_x - AC_x * AD_z = (-8)*0 - (-4)*(-8) = 0 - 32 = -32\n\nk: AC_x * AD_y - AC_y * AD_x = (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 = 20\n\nSo, cross product is (-40, -32, 20). That seems correct.\n\nThen, AB is (-4, -5, 0). Dot product with (-40, -32, 20):\n\n(-4)*(-40) = 160\n\n(-5)*(-32) = 160\n\n0*20 = 0\n\nTotal is 320. So, V = 320 / 6 = 160/3. Hmm, that seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the volume another way to check.\n\nWait, another approach: since all opposite edges are equal, the tetrahedron is isohedral? Or maybe it's a disphenoid. A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, which is the case here.\n\nFor a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / 72\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm confusing it with another formula. Alternatively, for a disphenoid, the volume is sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / 72, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should look for another formula.\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates, perhaps we can compute the volume using the determinant method, which I already did. So, perhaps 160/3 is correct.\n\nWait, let me think about the edges again. The edges are AB=\u221a41, AC=\u221a80, BC=\u221a89, etc. So, all the edges are sqrt of numbers that are 41, 80, 89. So, the volume is 160/3? Hmm, maybe. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the total surface area of the tetrahedron. Since it's a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles? Wait, no, in a disphenoid, opposite faces are congruent, but not necessarily all four.\n\nWait, let me check: in a disphenoid, there are two pairs of congruent triangles. So, in our case, maybe the faces ABC and ADC are congruent, and faces ABD and BCD are congruent. Alternatively, perhaps each pair of opposite faces is congruent.\n\nBut in any case, maybe it's easier to compute the area of one face and multiply by four? Wait, no, because in a disphenoid, opposite faces are congruent, but not all four faces are necessarily congruent.\n\nWait, let's compute the areas of the four faces.\n\nGiven the edge lengths, each face is a triangle with sides of length sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Wait, is that the case?\n\nWait, let's take face ABC. The edges are AB=\u221a41, BC=\u221a89, and AC=\u221a80. So, each face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89.\n\nSo, all four faces are congruent triangles, each with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. That's helpful because then the surface area is 4 times the area of one such triangle.\n\nSo, let's compute the area of triangle ABC with sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nWe can use Heron's formula for the area. Heron's formula says that the area is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nFirst, compute s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nCompute a + b + c: \u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89.\n\nWait, but that's a bit messy. Alternatively, since the sides are \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89, maybe we can compute s\u00b2 and so on, but perhaps it's better to compute numerically.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better approach. Alternatively, since the triangle has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), perhaps it's a right triangle? Let me check.\n\nCheck if 41 + 80 = 89. 41 + 80 = 121, and 89 is less than that. So, no, not a right triangle. Alternatively, maybe 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11\u00b2, but 89 is not 11\u00b2, so it's not a right triangle.\n\nHmm, okay, so we have to compute the area using Heron's formula.\n\nLet me compute s:\n\ns = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2\n\nBut this is complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the area using the formula (1/4)\u221a[(a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)], but that's Heron's formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can compute the area using vectors or coordinates.\n\nWait, since we have the coordinates of the points, perhaps it's easier to compute the area of one face using vectors.\n\nLet me compute the area of triangle ABC. Points A, B, C:\n\nA: (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB: (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC: (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nSo, vectors AB and AC can be used to compute the area.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute vectors AB, AC, and then compute the cross product.\n\nWait, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2) the magnitude of the cross product of vectors AB and AC.\n\nWait, but AB and AC are vectors from point A to B and A to C. So, vectors AB = B - A, AC = C - A.\n\nCompute vectors AB and AC:\n\nAB = B - A = (-2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, 4 - 4) = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = C - A = (-2 - 2, 5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nSo, vectors AB = (-4, -5, 0), AC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCompute the cross product AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nUsing the cross product formula:\n\ni component: AB_y * AC_z - AB_z * AC_y = (-5)*(-8) - 0*0 = 40 - 0 = 40\n\nj component: AB_z * AC_x - AB_x * AC_z = 0*(-4) - (-4)*(-8) = 0 - 32 = -32\n\nk component: AB_x * AC_y - AB_y * AC_x = (-4)*0 - (-5)*(-4) = 0 - 20 = -20\n\nSo, AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)\u00b2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 \u00f7 16 = 189. So, sqrt(16*189) = 4*sqrt(189)\n\n189 = 9 * 21 = 9 * 3 * 7. So, sqrt(189) = 3*sqrt(21)\n\nThus, the magnitude is 4*3*sqrt(21) = 12*sqrt(21)\n\nSo, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12*sqrt(21) = 6*sqrt(21)\n\nTherefore, each face has an area of 6\u221a21, and there are four faces, so the total surface area A is 4 * 6\u221a21 = 24\u221a21.\n\nWait, that seems manageable. So, surface area A = 24\u221a21.\n\nEarlier, I found the volume V = 160/3.\n\nSo, the inradius r is 3V / A = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160 / (24\u221a21) = (160)/(24\u221a21)\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8: 20 / (3\u221a21)\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21:\n\n(20\u221a21) / (3*21) = (20\u221a21)/(63)\n\nSo, the inradius r is (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nNow, the problem states that the distance is in the form m\u221an/p, where m and p are coprime, and n is square-free.\n\nLooking at (20\u221a21)/63, let's see if 20 and 63 have any common factors. 20 factors into 2\u00b2 *5, and 63 is 7*3\u00b2. No common factors, so m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nWait, but wait, 21 is 3*7, which is square-free, so that's good.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63. Therefore, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because 104 seems a bit high, but maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, let me recap:\n\n- I found the coordinates correctly, leading to vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\n- Calculated the scalar triple product correctly, giving volume 160/3.\n\n- Calculated the area of one face using cross product, getting 6\u221a21.\n\n- Since all faces are congruent, total surface area is 4*6\u221a21 = 24\u221a21.\n\n- Then, inradius r = 3V / A = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160/(24\u221a21) = 20/(3\u221a21) = (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me confirm the calculation of the cross product for the area.\n\nEarlier, I computed AB \u00d7 AC as (40, -32, -20), whose magnitude is sqrt(40\u00b2 + 32\u00b2 + 20\u00b2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024). But 3024 is 16 * 189, as I thought. Then, 189 is 9 * 21, so sqrt(189) is 3\u221a21. So, 4 * 3\u221a21 is 12\u221a21. Then, half of that is 6\u221a21. So that's correct.\n\nYes, so the area of each face is 6\u221a21, so four faces make 24\u221a21. Volume is 160/3.\n\nSo, r = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160 / (24\u221a21) = (160 \u00f7 8) / (24 \u00f7 8 * \u221a21) )= 20 / (3\u221a21). Rationalizing gives (20\u221a21)/(63).\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63. m and p are coprime because 20 and 63 share no common factors besides 1. n=21 is square-free because 21 factors into 3 and 7, both primes.\n\nSo, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but 63 is 7 * 3\u00b2. Wait, but in the formula, the denominator is 63, which is 7*9. So, the answer is 20\u221a21/63, so m=20, n=21, p=63. Thus, sum is 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer is 104.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the tetrahedron $ABCD$ has opposite edges equal, making it an isosceles tetrahedron. We place the vertices in a coordinate system to simplify calculations:\n\n- $A = (2, \\frac{5}{2}, 4)$\n- $B = (-2, -\\frac{5}{2}, 4)$\n- $C = (-2, \\frac{5}{2}, -4)$\n- $D = (2, -\\frac{5}{2}, -4)$\n\nWe compute the vectors from $A$ to $B$, $C$, and $D$:\n- $\\overrightarrow{AB} = (-4, -5, 0)$\n- $\\overrightarrow{AC} = (-4, 0, -8)$\n- $\\overrightarrow{AD} = (0, -5, -8)$\n\nUsing the scalar triple product to find the volume $V$:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{AB} \\cdot (\\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD}) = 320\n\\]\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{6} |320| = \\frac{160}{3}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the area of one face using the cross product. For face $ABC$:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{AB} \\times \\overrightarrow{AC} = (40, -32, -20)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Magnitude} = \\sqrt{40^2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2} = 12\\sqrt{21}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Area of } ABC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12\\sqrt{21} = 6\\sqrt{21}\n\\]\n\nThe total surface area $A$ is four times the area of one face:\n\\[\nA = 4 \\times 6\\sqrt{21} = 24\\sqrt{21}\n\\]\n\nThe inradius $r$ is given by:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{3V}{A} = \\frac{3 \\times \\frac{160}{3}}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{160}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}\n\\]\n\nThus, the distance is $\\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}$, where $m = 20$, $n = 21$, and $p = 63$. Therefore, $m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104$.\n\n\\boxed{104}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this tetrahedron problem. The tetrahedron is named ABCD, and it has some specific edge lengths. The edges AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. I need to find this distance, which can be written in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, compute m + n + p.\n\nHmm, okay. So first, the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal. AB = CD, AC = BD, AD = BC. That seems symmetric. I remember that in such cases, the tetrahedron is called \"equifacial\" or maybe \"isohedral,\" but I'm not sure. Wait, no, equifacial means all faces are congruent, which might not be the case here. But since opposite edges are equal, it's a special kind of tetrahedron.\n\nI think such tetrahedrons are called \"edge-transitive,\" but perhaps more importantly, they might have some properties that make the calculations easier. Maybe they can be embedded in a coordinate system in a symmetric way.\n\nThe point I is equidistant from all four faces. That point is called the incenter of the tetrahedron, analogous to the incenter of a triangle. The distance is the inradius.\n\nSo, to find the inradius, I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area. The formula for the inradius r is 3V / A, where V is the volume and A is the total surface area.\n\nWait, yes, in a tetrahedron, the inradius is given by r = 3V / A, where A is the sum of the areas of the four faces.\n\nSo, I need to compute the volume V of the tetrahedron and the sum of the areas of its four faces.\n\nBut to compute V, I might need coordinates. Alternatively, perhaps I can use some properties of the tetrahedron given the edge lengths.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the volume given the edge lengths. Maybe using the Cayley-Menger determinant? Yes, that's a formula that gives the volume of a tetrahedron based on its edge lengths.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:\n\nVolume V = sqrt( CM / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the following matrix:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   a\u00b2  b\u00b2  c\u00b2 |\n| 1  a\u00b2   0   d\u00b2  e\u00b2 |\n| 1  b\u00b2  d\u00b2   0   f\u00b2 |\n| 1  c\u00b2  e\u00b2  f\u00b2   0  |\n\nSo, I can plug in the given edge lengths into this determinant and compute the volume.\n\nLet me list the edges:\n\nAB = sqrt(41) => a\u00b2 = 41\n\nAC = sqrt(80) => b\u00b2 = 80\n\nAD = sqrt(89) => c\u00b2 = 89\n\nBC = sqrt(89) => d\u00b2 = 89\n\nBD = sqrt(80) => e\u00b2 = 80\n\nCD = sqrt(41) => f\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo, constructing the Cayley-Menger matrix:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check the positions.\n\nYes, the matrix is 5x5, with the first row and column starting with 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, and the other rows correspond to the squared distances.\n\nSo, the determinant of this matrix will be used to compute the volume.\n\nCalculating a 5x5 determinant by hand can be tedious, but perhaps there's some symmetry here that can make it easier.\n\nLooking at the matrix:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nI notice that the matrix is symmetric. Also, the squared distances follow a pattern where opposite edges are equal. So perhaps the determinant can be simplified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find coordinates for the tetrahedron that exploit this symmetry.\n\nWait, another approach: since opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron is \"isohedral\" or has some reflection symmetry. Maybe I can place the points in a coordinate system such that the centroid is at the origin, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can position the points in such a way that the coordinates are symmetric.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates.\n\nLet me consider points A, B, C, D. Let me place point A at (x, y, z), point B at (-x, -y, z), point C at (-x, y, -z), point D at (x, -y, -z). This might give some symmetry. Let me see if this works.\n\nWait, perhaps this is a way to make opposite edges equal. Let me think.\n\nIf I set up the points this way, then the distance AB would be sqrt{(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0^2} = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Similarly, the distance CD would be sqrt{(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2} = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). But in our case, AB = CD, so 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). That would imply z = 0, which can't be because then the tetrahedron would be flat.\n\nHmm, perhaps that approach isn't the best.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the tetrahedron as two triangles connected in a symmetric way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the tetrahedron as a disphenoid, which is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. Yes, that's the case here. So this is a disphenoid.\n\nDisphenoids have some properties that make calculations easier. For example, all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, no, in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent in pairs. Wait, let me recall.\n\nA disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. So, in our case, AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC. So it's a disphenoid.\n\nIn a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent if and only if it's a regular tetrahedron, but in our case, the edges are of different lengths, so the faces are congruent in pairs.\n\nWait, no, actually, in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent if and only if it's a regular tetrahedron. But in our case, it's a general disphenoid, so the faces are congruent in pairs.\n\nSo, in this case, the opposite edges are equal, so the faces opposite each other are congruent. So, for example, face ABC is congruent to face CDA, and face ABD is congruent to face BCD.\n\nHmm, perhaps the areas of the faces can be grouped into two pairs of equal areas.\n\nSo, perhaps I can compute the area of one face, then multiply by two, and then compute the area of another face, multiply by two, and sum them all for the total surface area.\n\nBut to compute the areas, I need to know the lengths of the edges of each face.\n\nWait, each face is a triangle with sides given by the edges.\n\nFor example, face ABC has edges AB, BC, AC: sqrt(41), sqrt(89), sqrt(80).\n\nSimilarly, face ABD has edges AB, BD, AD: sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89).\n\nSo, faces ABC and ABD are congruent? Wait, no, because the sides are the same: ABC has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(89), sqrt(80), same as ABD. So actually, all four faces are congruent triangles, each with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Wait, that can't be because in a disphenoid, opposite faces are congruent, but adjacent faces might not be.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nNo, in our case, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So all four faces are congruent. That's interesting. So each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Therefore, all four faces have the same area. So, the total surface area A is 4 times the area of one face.\n\nThat's helpful because then I can compute the area of one face and multiply by four.\n\nSo, let's compute the area of one face, say triangle ABC.\n\nUsing Heron's formula: the semi-perimeter s is (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.\n\nThen, the area is sqrt[s(s - sqrt(41))(s - sqrt(80))(s - sqrt(89))].\n\nWait, that's going to be messy, but maybe we can compute it numerically or find a way to express it more simply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the area using vectors or coordinates if we can find coordinates for the points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to compute the volume first using the Cayley-Menger determinant because that might be more straightforward.\n\nSo, let's proceed with the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   41  80  89 |\n| 1  41   0   89  80 |\n| 1  80  89   0   41 |\n| 1  89  80   41   0 |\n\nWe need to compute this determinant.\n\nCalculating a 5x5 determinant manually is quite involved, but perhaps we can exploit the symmetry.\n\nLet me denote the determinant as CM.\n\nCM = determinant of the above matrix.\n\nI can expand the determinant along the first row.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n0 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor)\n\nWait, the first element is 0, so the first term is zero. Then, the other terms are the cofactors.\n\nSo, CM = -1 * det(M12) + 1 * det(M13) - 1 * det(M14) + 1 * det(M15)\n\nWhere M1j is the minor matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column j.\n\nBut this is going to get complicated. Let me see if there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can perform row and column operations to simplify the determinant.\n\nLooking at the matrix, the rows 1 to 4 (excluding the first row) have a certain symmetry. Let me see:\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nI notice that the entries are cyclically shifted. For example, row 2 is row 1 shifted right by one, row 3 is row 2 shifted right by one, etc. Hmm, not exactly, because the diagonal elements change as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps subtracting rows from each other can create zeros.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps subtract row 2 from row 1, row 3 from row 2, row 4 from row 3, etc., to create a pattern.\n\nWait, let's try subtracting row 2 from row 1.\n\nRow1 becomes Row1 - Row2: (1-1, 0-41, 41-0, 80-89, 89-80) = (0, -41, 41, -9, 9)\n\nSimilarly, Row2 becomes Row2 - Row3: (1-1, 41-80, 0-89, 89-0, 80-41) = (0, -39, -89, 89, 39)\n\nRow3 becomes Row3 - Row4: (1-1, 80-89, 89-80, 0-41, 41-0) = (0, -9, 9, -41, 41)\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps adding rows together.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to proceed with the expansion.\n\nBut perhaps instead, I can recognize that the Cayley-Menger determinant for a disphenoid has a known formula.\n\nWait, I remember that for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / (8 * sqrt(2))\n\nWait, no, that's for a tetrahedron with edges a, b, c, and all opposite edges equal. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume by finding coordinates.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the tetrahedron.\n\nSince the opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron can be embedded in such a way that the coordinates are symmetric.\n\nLet me try setting point A at (x, y, z), point B at (-x, -y, z), point C at (-x, y, -z), and point D at (x, -y, -z). Let me see if this setup can satisfy the given edge lengths.\n\nCompute AB: distance between A (x,y,z) and B (-x,-y,z). That's sqrt{(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0} = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Given AB = sqrt(41), so 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(41) => sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(41)/2.\n\nSimilarly, compute AC: distance between A (x,y,z) and C (-x,y,-z). That's sqrt{(2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2} = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2). Given AC = sqrt(80), so 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80) => sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80)/2.\n\nSimilarly, compute AD: distance between A (x,y,z) and D (x,-y,-z). That's sqrt{0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2} = 2*sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). Given AD = sqrt(89), so 2*sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89) => sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89)/2.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(41)/2 => x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4. (1)\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80)/2 => x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 80/4 = 20. (2)\n\nsqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89)/2 => y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4. (3)\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\n1) x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n\n2) x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\n\n3) y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4 => z\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 20 - 10.25 = 9.75 = 39/4.\n\nFrom equation 3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nz\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 39/4\n\nz\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\n2z\u00b2 = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32 => z\u00b2 = 16 => z = 4 or z = -4.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n2y\u00b2 = (89 - 39)/4 = 50/4 = 12.5 => y\u00b2 = 6.25 => y = 2.5 or y = -2.5.\n\nThen, from equation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4 => x\u00b2 = 41/4 - 25/4 = 16/4 = 4 => x = 2 or x = -2.\n\nSo, x = \u00b12, y = \u00b12.5, z = \u00b14.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates can be assigned as:\n\nA = (2, 2.5, 4)\n\nB = (-2, -2.5, 4)\n\nC = (-2, 2.5, -4)\n\nD = (2, -2.5, -4)\n\nWait, let me verify the distances.\n\nCompute AB: distance between (2,2.5,4) and (-2,-2.5,4).\n\nDifference in x: 4, y: -5, z:0.\n\nSo, distance squared: 16 + 25 + 0 = 41. So, distance sqrt(41). Correct.\n\nCompute AC: distance between (2,2.5,4) and (-2,2.5,-4).\n\nDifference in x: -4, y:0, z: -8.\n\nDistance squared: 16 + 0 + 64 = 80. Correct.\n\nCompute AD: distance between (2,2.5,4) and (2,-2.5,-4).\n\nDifference in x:0, y: -5, z: -8.\n\nDistance squared: 0 + 25 + 64 = 89. Correct.\n\nSo, the coordinates are correctly assigned.\n\nNow, with coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron.\n\nThe volume can be computed using the scalar triple product formula. The formula is:\n\nV = | (AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD)) | / 6\n\nWhere AB, AC, AD are vectors from point A.\n\nFirst, compute vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nVector AB = B - A = (-2 - 2, -2.5 - 2.5, 4 - 4) = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nVector AC = C - A = (-2 - 2, 2.5 - 2.5, -4 - 4) = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nVector AD = D - A = (2 - 2, -2.5 - 2.5, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8)\n\nNow, compute the cross product AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nLet me write vectors AC and AD as:\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nCross product is:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n|-4\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0-8|\n|0\u00a0-5\u00a0-8|\n\n= i*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni: 0*(-8) = 0; (-8)*(-5) = 40. So, i*(0 - 40) = -40i\n\nj: (-4)*(-8) = 32; (-8)*0 = 0. So, j*(32 - 0) = 32j, but with a negative sign: -32j\n\nk: (-4)*(-5) = 20; 0*0 = 0. So, k*(20 - 0) = 20k\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nNow, compute the dot product of AB with this cross product.\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nDot product = (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*(20) = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320\n\nSo, the volume V = |320| / 6 = 320 / 6 = 160/3 \u2248 53.333...\n\nWait, but wait, the determinant in the Cayley-Menger formula is 288 V\u00b2. So, if I compute V as 160/3, then CM = 288*(160/3)^2.\n\nBut let me check if I did the cross product correctly.\n\nWait, AC \u00d7 AD:\n\ni component: (AC_y * AD_z - AC_z * AD_y) = (0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) = 0 - 40 = -40\n\nj component: -(AC_x * AD_z - AC_z * AD_x) = -((-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0) = -(32 - 0) = -32\n\nk component: (AC_x * AD_y - AC_y * AD_x) = (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 = 20\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nDot product with AB:\n\nAB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD) = (-4)(-40) + (-5)(-32) + 0*(20) = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320\n\nSo, V = 320 / 6 = 160/3. So, volume is 160/3.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The scalar triple product gives the volume as |det| / 6, where det is the scalar triple product. So, yes, 320 / 6 is correct.\n\nSo, V = 160/3.\n\nNext, compute the total surface area A.\n\nAs each face is congruent, with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, compute the area of one face and multiply by four.\n\nLet me compute the area of triangle ABC.\n\nUsing Heron's formula:\n\ns = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2\n\nBut this will be complicated. Alternatively, since we have coordinates, perhaps compute the area using vectors.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the edge lengths, perhaps we can compute the area via the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nBut this is Heron's formula squared.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the area using the cross product.\n\nWait, in the coordinate system, triangle ABC has points A, B, C.\n\nCompute vectors AB and AC, then compute (1/2) |AB \u00d7 AC|.\n\nYes, that's another way.\n\nFrom earlier, vectors AB = (-4, -5, 0) and AC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCompute the cross product AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nAB \u00d7 AC = |i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-4\u00a0\u00a0-5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0-8\n\n= i*(-5*(-8) - 0*0) - j*(-4*(-8) - 0*(-4)) + k*(-4*0 - (-5)*(-4))\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni: (-5)*(-8) = 40; 0*0=0. So, 40i\n\nj: (-4)*(-8) = 32; 0*(-4)=0. So, 32j, but with a negative sign: -32j\n\nk: (-4)*0 = 0; (-5)*(-4) = 20. So, (0 - 20) = -20k\n\nThus, AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)\u00b2 + (-20)\u00b2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7\n\nSo sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21)\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, each face has area 6 sqrt(21). Therefore, total surface area A = 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21)\n\nNow, compute the inradius r = 3V / A = 3*(160/3) / (24 sqrt(21)) ) = (160) / (24 sqrt(21)) = (20) / (3 sqrt(21)) \n\nSimplify this:\n\nr = 20 / (3 sqrt(21)) = (20 sqrt(21)) / (3 * 21) ) = (20 sqrt(21)) / 63\n\nSo, written as m sqrt(n)/p, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nBut check if m and p are coprime. 20 and 63 share a GCD of 1, so yes. And n=21 is square-free (prime factors 3 and 7, no squares).\n\nSo, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, V = 160/3.\n\nA = 24 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, r = 3V / A = (3*(160/3)) / (24 sqrt(21)) ) = 160 / (24 sqrt(21)) = (160 / 24) / sqrt(21) = (20 / 3) / sqrt(21) = 20 / (3 sqrt(21)).\n\nYes, that's correct. Then rationalizing the denominator:\n\n20 / (3 sqrt(21)) = (20 sqrt(21)) / (3 * 21) ) = 20 sqrt(21) / 63.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63. 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nSo, the answer is 104.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this tetrahedron problem. The tetrahedron is named ABCD, and it has some specific edge lengths. The edges AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. I need to find this distance, which can be written in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, compute m + n + p.\n\nHmm, okay. So first, the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal. AB = CD, AC = BD, AD = BC. That seems symmetric. I remember that in such cases, the tetrahedron is called \"equifacial\" or maybe \"isohedral,\" but I'm not sure. Wait, no, equifacial means all faces are congruent, which might not be the case here. But since opposite edges are equal, it's a special kind of tetrahedron.\n\nI think such tetrahedrons are called \"edge-transitive,\" but perhaps more importantly, they might have some properties that make the calculations easier. Maybe they can be embedded in a coordinate system in a symmetric way.\n\nThe point I is equidistant from all four faces. That point is called the incenter of the tetrahedron, analogous to the incenter of a triangle. The distance is the inradius.\n\nSo, to find the inradius, I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area. The formula for the inradius r is 3V / A, where V is the volume and A is the total surface area.\n\nWait, yes, in a tetrahedron, the inradius is given by r = 3V / A, where A is the sum of the areas of the four faces.\n\nSo, I need to compute the volume V of the tetrahedron and the sum of the areas of its four faces.\n\nBut to compute V, I might need coordinates. Alternatively, perhaps I can use some properties of the tetrahedron given the edge lengths.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the volume given the edge lengths. Maybe using the Cayley-Menger determinant? Yes, that's a formula that gives the volume of a tetrahedron based on its edge lengths.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:\n\nVolume V = sqrt( CM / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the following matrix:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   a\u00b2  b\u00b2  c\u00b2 |\n| 1  a\u00b2   0   d\u00b2  e\u00b2 |\n| 1  b\u00b2  d\u00b2   0   f\u00b2 |\n| 1  c\u00b2  e\u00b2  f\u00b2   0  |\n\nSo, I can plug in the given edge lengths into this determinant and compute the volume.\n\nLet me list the edges:\n\nAB = sqrt(41) => a\u00b2 = 41\n\nAC = sqrt(80) => b\u00b2 = 80\n\nAD = sqrt(89) => c\u00b2 = 89\n\nBC = sqrt(89) => d\u00b2 = 89\n\nBD = sqrt(80) => e\u00b2 = 80\n\nCD = sqrt(41) => f\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo, constructing the Cayley-Menger matrix:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check the positions.\n\nYes, the matrix is 5x5, with the first row and column starting with 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, and the other rows correspond to the squared distances.\n\nSo, the determinant of this matrix will be used to compute the volume.\n\nCalculating a 5x5 determinant by hand can be tedious, but perhaps there's some symmetry here that can make it easier.\n\nLooking at the matrix:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nI notice that the matrix is symmetric. Also, the squared distances follow a pattern where opposite edges are equal. So perhaps the determinant can be simplified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find coordinates for the tetrahedron that exploit this symmetry.\n\nWait, another approach: since opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron is \"isohedral\" or has some reflection symmetry. Maybe I can place the points in a coordinate system such that the centroid is at the origin, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can position the points in such a way that the coordinates are symmetric.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates.\n\nLet me consider points A, B, C, D. Let me place point A at (x, y, z), point B at (-x, -y, z), point C at (-x, y, -z), point D at (x, -y, -z). This might give some symmetry. Let me see if this works.\n\nWait, perhaps this is a way to make opposite edges equal. Let me think.\n\nIf I set up the points this way, then the distance AB would be sqrt{(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0^2} = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Similarly, the distance CD would be sqrt{(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2} = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). But in our case, AB = CD, so 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). That would imply z = 0, which can't be because then the tetrahedron would be flat.\n\nHmm, perhaps that approach isn't the best.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the tetrahedron as two triangles connected in a symmetric way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the tetrahedron as a disphenoid, which is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. Yes, that's the case here. So this is a disphenoid.\n\nDisphenoids have some properties that make calculations easier. For example, all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, no, in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent in pairs. Wait, let me recall.\n\nA disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. So, in our case, AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC. So it's a disphenoid.\n\nIn a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent if and only if it's a regular tetrahedron, but in our case, the edges are of different lengths, so the faces are congruent in pairs.\n\nWait, no, actually, in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent if and only if it's a regular tetrahedron. But in our case, it's a general disphenoid, so the faces are congruent in pairs.\n\nSo, in this case, the opposite edges are equal, so the faces opposite each other are congruent. So, for example, face ABC is congruent to face CDA, and face ABD is congruent to face BCD.\n\nHmm, perhaps the areas of the faces can be grouped into two pairs of equal areas.\n\nSo, perhaps I can compute the area of one face, then multiply by two, and then compute the area of another face, multiply by two, and sum them all for the total surface area.\n\nBut to compute the areas, I need to know the lengths of the edges of each face.\n\nWait, each face is a triangle with sides given by the edges.\n\nFor example, face ABC has edges AB, BC, AC: sqrt(41), sqrt(89), sqrt(80).\n\nSimilarly, face ABD has edges AB, BD, AD: sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89).\n\nSo, faces ABC and ABD are congruent? Wait, no, because the sides are the same: ABC has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(89), sqrt(80), same as ABD. So actually, all four faces are congruent triangles, each with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Wait, that can't be because in a disphenoid, opposite faces are congruent, but adjacent faces might not be.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nNo, in our case, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So all four faces are congruent. That's interesting. So each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Therefore, all four faces have the same area. So, the total surface area A is 4 times the area of one face.\n\nThat's helpful because then I can compute the area of one face and multiply by four.\n\nSo, let's compute the area of one face, say triangle ABC.\n\nUsing Heron's formula: the semi-perimeter s is (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.\n\nThen, the area is sqrt[s(s - sqrt(41))(s - sqrt(80))(s - sqrt(89))].\n\nWait, that's going to be messy, but maybe we can compute it numerically or find a way to express it more simply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the area using vectors or coordinates if we can find coordinates for the points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to compute the volume first using the Cayley-Menger determinant because that might be more straightforward.\n\nSo, let's proceed with the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   41  80  89 |\n| 1  41   0   89  80 |\n| 1  80  89   0   41 |\n| 1  89  80   41   0 |\n\nWe need to compute this determinant.\n\nCalculating a 5x5 determinant manually is quite involved, but perhaps we can exploit the symmetry.\n\nLet me denote the determinant as CM.\n\nCM = determinant of the above matrix.\n\nI can expand the determinant along the first row.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n0 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor)\n\nWait, the first element is 0, so the first term is zero. Then, the other terms are the cofactors.\n\nSo, CM = -1 * det(M12) + 1 * det(M13) - 1 * det(M14) + 1 * det(M15)\n\nWhere M1j is the minor matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column j.\n\nBut this is going to get complicated. Let me see if there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can perform row and column operations to simplify the determinant.\n\nLooking at the matrix, the rows 1 to 4 (excluding the first row) have a certain symmetry. Let me see:\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nI notice that the entries are cyclically shifted. For example, row 2 is row 1 shifted right by one, row 3 is row 2 shifted right by one, etc. Hmm, not exactly, because the diagonal elements change as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps subtracting rows from each other can create zeros.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps subtract row 2 from row 1, row 3 from row 2, row 4 from row 3, etc., to create a pattern.\n\nWait, let's try subtracting row 2 from row 1.\n\nRow1 becomes Row1 - Row2: (1-1, 0-41, 41-0, 80-89, 89-80) = (0, -41, 41, -9, 9)\n\nSimilarly, Row2 becomes Row2 - Row3: (1-1, 41-80, 0-89, 89-0, 80-41) = (0, -39, -89, 89, 39)\n\nRow3 becomes Row3 - Row4: (1-1, 80-89, 89-80, 0-41, 41-0) = (0, -9, 9, -41, 41)\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps adding rows together.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to proceed with the expansion.\n\nBut perhaps instead, I can recognize that the Cayley-Menger determinant for a disphenoid has a known formula.\n\nWait, I remember that for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / (8 * sqrt(2))\n\nWait, no, that's for a tetrahedron with edges a, b, c, and all opposite edges equal. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume by finding coordinates.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the tetrahedron.\n\nSince the opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron can be embedded in such a way that the coordinates are symmetric.\n\nLet me try setting point A at (x, y, z), point B at (-x, -y, z), point C at (-x, y, -z), and point D at (x, -y, -z). Let me see if this setup can satisfy the given edge lengths.\n\nCompute AB: distance between A (x,y,z) and B (-x,-y,z). That's sqrt{(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0} = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Given AB = sqrt(41), so 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(41) => sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(41)/2.\n\nSimilarly, compute AC: distance between A (x,y,z) and C (-x,y,-z). That's sqrt{(2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2} = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2). Given AC = sqrt(80), so 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80) => sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80)/2.\n\nSimilarly, compute AD: distance between A (x,y,z) and D (x,-y,-z). That's sqrt{0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2} = 2*sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). Given AD = sqrt(89), so 2*sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89) => sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89)/2.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(41)/2 => x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4. (1)\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80)/2 => x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 80/4 = 20. (2)\n\nsqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89)/2 => y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4. (3)\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\n1) x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n\n2) x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\n\n3) y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4 => z\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 20 - 10.25 = 9.75 = 39/4.\n\nFrom equation 3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nz\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 39/4\n\nz\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\n2z\u00b2 = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32 => z\u00b2 = 16 => z = 4 or z = -4.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n2y\u00b2 = (89 - 39)/4 = 50/4 = 12.5 => y\u00b2 = 6.25 => y = 2.5 or y = -2.5.\n\nThen, from equation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4 => x\u00b2 = 41/4 - 25/4 = 16/4 = 4 => x = 2 or x = -2.\n\nSo, x = \u00b12, y = \u00b12.5, z = \u00b14.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates can be assigned as:\n\nA = (2, 2.5, 4)\n\nB = (-2, -2.5, 4)\n\nC = (-2, 2.5, -4)\n\nD = (2, -2.5, -4)\n\nWait, let me verify the distances.\n\nCompute AB: distance between (2,2.5,4) and (-2,-2.5,4).\n\nDifference in x: 4, y: -5, z:0.\n\nSo, distance squared: 16 + 25 + 0 = 41. So, distance sqrt(41). Correct.\n\nCompute AC: distance between (2,2.5,4) and (-2,2.5,-4).\n\nDifference in x: -4, y:0, z: -8.\n\nDistance squared: 16 + 0 + 64 = 80. Correct.\n\nCompute AD: distance between (2,2.5,4) and (2,-2.5,-4).\n\nDifference in x:0, y: -5, z: -8.\n\nDistance squared: 0 + 25 + 64 = 89. Correct.\n\nSo, the coordinates are correctly assigned.\n\nNow, with coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron.\n\nThe volume can be computed using the scalar triple product formula. The formula is:\n\nV = | (AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD)) | / 6\n\nWhere AB, AC, AD are vectors from point A.\n\nFirst, compute vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nVector AB = B - A = (-2 - 2, -2.5 - 2.5, 4 - 4) = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nVector AC = C - A = (-2 - 2, 2.5 - 2.5, -4 - 4) = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nVector AD = D - A = (2 - 2, -2.5 - 2.5, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8)\n\nNow, compute the cross product AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nLet me write vectors AC and AD as:\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nCross product is:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n|-4\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0-8|\n|0\u00a0-5\u00a0-8|\n\n= i*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni: 0*(-8) = 0; (-8)*(-5) = 40. So, i*(0 - 40) = -40i\n\nj: (-4)*(-8) = 32; (-8)*0 = 0. So, j*(32 - 0) = 32j, but with a negative sign: -32j\n\nk: (-4)*(-5) = 20; 0*0 = 0. So, k*(20 - 0) = 20k\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nNow, compute the dot product of AB with this cross product.\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nDot product = (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*(20) = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320\n\nSo, the volume V = |320| / 6 = 320 / 6 = 160/3 \u2248 53.333...\n\nWait, but wait, the determinant in the Cayley-Menger formula is 288 V\u00b2. So, if I compute V as 160/3, then CM = 288*(160/3)^2.\n\nBut let me check if I did the cross product correctly.\n\nWait, AC \u00d7 AD:\n\ni component: (AC_y * AD_z - AC_z * AD_y) = (0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) = 0 - 40 = -40\n\nj component: -(AC_x * AD_z - AC_z * AD_x) = -((-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0) = -(32 - 0) = -32\n\nk component: (AC_x * AD_y - AC_y * AD_x) = (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 = 20\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nDot product with AB:\n\nAB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD) = (-4)(-40) + (-5)(-32) + 0*(20) = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320\n\nSo, V = 320 / 6 = 160/3. So, volume is 160/3.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The scalar triple product gives the volume as |det| / 6, where det is the scalar triple product. So, yes, 320 / 6 is correct.\n\nSo, V = 160/3.\n\nNext, compute the total surface area A.\n\nAs each face is congruent, with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, compute the area of one face and multiply by four.\n\nLet me compute the area of triangle ABC.\n\nUsing Heron's formula:\n\ns = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2\n\nBut this will be complicated. Alternatively, since we have coordinates, perhaps compute the area using vectors.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the edge lengths, perhaps we can compute the area via the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nBut this is Heron's formula squared.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the area using the cross product.\n\nWait, in the coordinate system, triangle ABC has points A, B, C.\n\nCompute vectors AB and AC, then compute (1/2) |AB \u00d7 AC|.\n\nYes, that's another way.\n\nFrom earlier, vectors AB = (-4, -5, 0) and AC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCompute the cross product AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nAB \u00d7 AC = |i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-4\u00a0\u00a0-5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0-8\n\n= i*(-5*(-8) - 0*0) - j*(-4*(-8) - 0*(-4)) + k*(-4*0 - (-5)*(-4))\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni: (-5)*(-8) = 40; 0*0=0. So, 40i\n\nj: (-4)*(-8) = 32; 0*(-4)=0. So, 32j, but with a negative sign: -32j\n\nk: (-4)*0 = 0; (-5)*(-4) = 20. So, (0 - 20) = -20k\n\nThus, AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)\u00b2 + (-20)\u00b2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7\n\nSo sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21)\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, each face has area 6 sqrt(21). Therefore, total surface area A = 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21)\n\nNow, compute the inradius r = 3V / A = 3*(160/3) / (24 sqrt(21)) ) = (160) / (24 sqrt(21)) = (20) / (3 sqrt(21)) \n\nSimplify this:\n\nr = 20 / (3 sqrt(21)) = (20 sqrt(21)) / (3 * 21) ) = (20 sqrt(21)) / 63\n\nSo, written as m sqrt(n)/p, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nBut check if m and p are coprime. 20 and 63 share a GCD of 1, so yes. And n=21 is square-free (prime factors 3 and 7, no squares).\n\nSo, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, V = 160/3.\n\nA = 24 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, r = 3V / A = (3*(160/3)) / (24 sqrt(21)) ) = 160 / (24 sqrt(21)) = (160 / 24) / sqrt(21) = (20 / 3) / sqrt(21) = 20 / (3 sqrt(21)).\n\nYes, that's correct. Then rationalizing the denominator:\n\n20 / (3 sqrt(21)) = (20 sqrt(21)) / (3 * 21) ) = 20 sqrt(21) / 63.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63. 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nSo, the answer is 104.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we recognize that the given tetrahedron is a disphenoid with opposite edges equal. We use the Cayley-Menger determinant to calculate its volume and then find the inradius using the formula \\( r = \\frac{3V}{A} \\), where \\( V \\) is the volume and \\( A \\) is the total surface area.\n\nFirst, we assign coordinates to the vertices of the tetrahedron based on the symmetry of the disphenoid. The coordinates are:\n- \\( A = (2, 2.5, 4) \\)\n- \\( B = (-2, -2.5, 4) \\)\n- \\( C = (-2, 2.5, -4) \\)\n- \\( D = (2, -2.5, -4) \\)\n\nUsing the scalar triple product, we compute the volume \\( V \\) as:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{6} \\left| \\mathbf{AB} \\cdot (\\mathbf{AC} \\times \\mathbf{AD}) \\right| = \\frac{160}{3}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the area of one face using the cross product. Each face has an area of \\( 6\\sqrt{21} \\), leading to a total surface area:\n\\[\nA = 4 \\times 6\\sqrt{21} = 24\\sqrt{21}\n\\]\n\nFinally, the inradius \\( r \\) is:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{3V}{A} = \\frac{3 \\times \\frac{160}{3}}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( m = 20 \\), \\( n = 21 \\), and \\( p = 63 \\). Summing these values gives:\n\\[\nm + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{104}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance is supposed to be in the form m\u221an / p, and then I have to find m + n + p.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the tetrahedron. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces, and the incenter is the point where the four \"bisectors\" meet, similar to the incenter in a triangle. The distance from this point to each face is the same, and that's what we're looking for.\n\nGiven the edge lengths:\n\n- AB = CD = \u221a41\n- AC = BD = \u221a80\n- BC = AD = \u221a89\n\nHmm, this looks symmetric in some way. It seems like opposite edges are equal. So AB equals CD, AC equals BD, and BC equals AD. That symmetry might be useful. Maybe this tetrahedron is \"isohedral\" or something? Or perhaps it's a kind of \"kite\" tetrahedron? Not sure, but the symmetry might help in calculations.\n\nI remember that in a tetrahedron, the volume can be found if we know the edge lengths, but it's a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can find the volume using another method because of the symmetry.\n\nWait, the problem is about the inradius. The formula for the inradius r of a tetrahedron is r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So I need to find V and S.\n\nSo, let's plan:\n\n1. Find the volume V of the tetrahedron.\n2. Find the total surface area S.\n3. Compute r = 3V / S.\n4. Express r in the required form and compute m + n + p.\n\nFirst, how to find the volume? One way is to use the Cayley-Menger determinant. I remember that for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, the volume can be calculated using a determinant. Let me recall the formula.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   AB\u00b2 AC\u00b2 AD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AB\u00b2  0   BC\u00b2 BD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AC\u00b2 BC\u00b2  0   CD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AD\u00b2 BD\u00b2 CD\u00b2  0  |\n\nThe determinant of this matrix divided by 288 gives the square of the volume.\n\nSo, let me assign the edge lengths:\n\nAB = \u221a41, so AB\u00b2 = 41\n\nAC = \u221a80, AC\u00b2 = 80\n\nAD = \u221a89, AD\u00b2 = 89\n\nBC = \u221a89, BC\u00b2 = 89\n\nBD = \u221a80, BD\u00b2 = 80\n\nCD = \u221a41, CD\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo the Cayley-Menger determinant matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nNow, I need to compute this determinant.\n\nLet me denote the matrix as CM with rows and columns 0 to 4.\n\nCM[0][0] = 0; CM[0][1]=1; CM[0][2]=1; CM[0][3]=1; CM[0][4]=1\n\nCM[1][0] = 1; CM[1][1]=0; CM[1][2]=41; CM[1][3]=80; CM[1][4]=89\n\nCM[2][0] = 1; CM[2][1]=41; CM[2][2]=0; CM[2][3]=89; CM[2][4]=80\n\nCM[3][0] = 1; CM[3][1]=80; CM[3][2]=89; CM[3][3]=0; CM[3][4]=41\n\nCM[4][0] = 1; CM[4][1]=89; CM[4][2]=80; CM[4][3]=41; CM[4][4]=0\n\nComputing a 5x5 determinant manually is a bit tedious, but maybe there's some symmetry or pattern that can help.\n\nLooking at the matrix, rows 1 and 2 are similar, as are rows 3 and 4. Similarly for columns.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1,41, 0, 89,80\n\nRow 3: 1,80,89,0,41\n\nRow 4: 1,89,80,41,0\n\nIt looks like each row is a permutation of the same numbers, just rotated or something.\n\nWait, perhaps the matrix has some symmetry. Let me check if it's symmetric.\n\nCM[1][2] = 41, CM[2][1]=41: yes.\n\nCM[1][3]=80, CM[3][1]=80: yes.\n\nCM[1][4]=89, CM[4][1]=89: yes.\n\nSimilarly, CM[2][3]=89, CM[3][2]=89: yes.\n\nCM[2][4]=80, CM[4][2]=80: yes.\n\nCM[3][4]=41, CM[4][3]=41: yes.\n\nSo the matrix is symmetric. That might help in computing the determinant, but not sure how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can perform row or column operations to simplify the determinant.\n\nSince the determinant is linear in each row, and we can subtract rows to create zeros.\n\nLet me consider subtracting row 1 from rows 2, 3, 4.\n\nSo, define:\n\nRow 2' = Row2 - Row1\n\nRow 3' = Row3 - Row1\n\nRow 4' = Row4 - Row1\n\nSimilarly, maybe do the same for columns, but let's see.\n\nCompute Row2' = Row2 - Row1:\n\nRow2: 1,41,0,89,80\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nSo Row2' = [1-1, 41-0, 0-41, 89-80, 80-89] = [0,41,-41,9,-9]\n\nSimilarly, Row3' = Row3 - Row1:\n\nRow3:1,80,89,0,41\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow3' = [0,80,-41, -80, -48]\n\nWait, let me compute each element:\n\nRow3' = [1-1, 80-0, 89-41, 0-80, 41-89] = [0,80,48,-80,-48]\n\nSimilarly, Row4' = Row4 - Row1:\n\nRow4:1,89,80,41,0\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow4' = [0,89,-41, -39,-89]\n\nWait, let me compute each element:\n\nRow4' = [1-1,89-0,80-41,41-80,0-89] = [0,89,39,-39,-89]\n\nSo, now the matrix after row operations (only rows 2,3,4 changed) looks like:\n\nRow0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow1: 1, 0, 41,80,89\n\nRow2':0,41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow3':0,80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow4':0,89,39,-39,-89\n\nNow, the determinant remains the same, since we subtracted rows.\n\nNow, since the first column has 0s in rows 2',3',4', maybe expanding along the first column.\n\nThe determinant of a matrix can be expanded along a row or column. The first column has 0s in rows 2,3,4, except row1 and row0.\n\nWait, but row0 is [0,1,1,1,1], which complicates things. Maybe instead, let's consider that the first column is [0,1,0,0,0]^T. Wait, no, because after the row operations, rows 2,3,4 have 0 in the first element, but row1 is still 1.\n\nSo the first column is:\n\nRow0: 0\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2':0\n\nRow3':0\n\nRow4':0\n\nSo the only non-zero entry is in row1, column0: 1.\n\nSo when expanding the determinant along column0, only the minor from row1, column0 contributes.\n\nThe determinant is then (-1)^{1+0} * 1 * M10, where M10 is the minor matrix obtained by removing row1 and column0.\n\nSo M10 is the 4x4 matrix:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow2': [41,-41,9,-9]\n\nRow3': [80,48,-80,-48]\n\nRow4': [89,39,-39,-89]\n\nWait, let me make sure:\n\nOriginal matrix after row operations:\n\nRow0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow1:1, 0,41,80,89\n\nRow2':0,41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow3':0,80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow4':0,89,39,-39,-89\n\nSo, removing row1 and column0, we get the minor:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow2': [41,-41,9,-9]\n\nRow3': [80,48,-80,-48]\n\nRow4': [89,39,-39,-89]\n\nWait, but the minor is 4x4, so the rows are rows 0,2',3',4' of the original, and columns 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo the minor is:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow2': [41,-41,9,-9]\n\nRow3': [80,48,-80,-48]\n\nRow4': [89,39,-39,-89]\n\nSo the determinant is (-1)^{1+0} * 1 * det(M10) = -det(M10)\n\nSo det(CM) = -det(M10)\n\nSo now, I need to compute det(M10), which is a 4x4 determinant.\n\nHmm, this is still a bit complicated, but perhaps we can perform some row operations to simplify it.\n\nLooking at M10:\n\nRow0:1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow2:80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow3:89,39,-39,-89\n\nLet me try to subtract Row0 from Rows1,2,3 to create zeros.\n\nDefine:\n\nRow1' = Row1 - 41*Row0\n\nRow2' = Row2 - 80*Row0\n\nRow3' = Row3 - 89*Row0\n\nWait, but that might not be helpful because it could create large coefficients. Alternatively, maybe factor out common terms.\n\nLooking at Row1:41,-41,9,-9\n\nI notice that Row1 can be written as 41*(1,-1, 9/41, -9/41), but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor 41 from the first two elements, 3 from last two.\n\nWait, 41*(1, -1) + 3*(3, -3) = 41*(1,-1) + 3*(3,-3) = (41 +9, -41 -9) = (50, -50). Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, Row1:41, -41, 9, -9.\n\nSo the first two elements are 41 and -41, which is 41*(1, -1), and the last two are 9 and -9, which is 9*(1,-1). So Row1 = (41 + 0, -41 +0, 9 +0, -9 +0). Wait, no, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, factor out (1,-1) from the first two and last two.\n\nWait, maybe notice that Row1 is 41*(1, -1, 9/41, -9/41). Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to perform row operations to create zeros.\n\nAlternatively, maybe expand this determinant.\n\nBut 4x4 determinant is manageable, but time-consuming. Let's consider expanding along the first column.\n\nWait, in M10, the first column is [1,41,80,89]^T.\n\nSo expanding along the first column:\n\n1 * det(minor at 1,1) - 41 * det(minor at 2,1) + 80 * det(minor at 3,1) -89 * det(minor at4,1)\n\nWait, actually, the cofactor expansion is:\n\nsum_{i=1 to 4} (-1)^{i+1} * M[i][1] * det(minor i,1)\n\nSo, for M10:\n\nRow0:1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow2:80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow3:89,39,-39,-89\n\nSo, the determinant is:\n\n1 * det(minor at (0,0)) - 1 * det(minor at (0,1)) + 1 * det(minor at (0,2)) -1 * det(minor at (0,3))\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, I think I'm confusing the indices.\n\nWait, M10 is a 4x4 matrix:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow1: [41,-41,9,-9]\n\nRow2: [80,48,-80,-48]\n\nRow3: [89,39,-39,-89]\n\nSo, when expanding along the first column (column 0), the entries are:\n\nRow0:1, Row1:41, Row2:80, Row3:89.\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n1 * det(minor00) - 41 * det(minor10) + 80 * det(minor20) -89 * det(minor30)\n\nWhere minor00 is the 3x3 matrix obtained by removing row0 and column0:\n\nminor00:\nRow1: [-41,9,-9]\n\nRow2: [48,-80,-48]\n\nRow3: [39,-39,-89]\n\nSimilarly, minor10 is the matrix obtained by removing row1 and column0:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1]\n\nRow2: [80,-80,-48]\n\nRow3: [89,-39,-89]\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, minor10 is the minor for element (1,0), which is in row1, column0. So removing row1 and column0, the minor is:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1]\n\nRow2: [48,-80,-48]\n\nRow3: [39,-39,-89]\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, original M10:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow1: [41,-41,9,-9]\n\nRow2: [80,48,-80,-48]\n\nRow3: [89,39,-39,-89]\n\nSo minor10 is removing row1 and column0, so the remaining rows are row0, row2, row3, and columns 1,2,3.\n\nThus, minor10 is:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1]\n\nRow2: [48,-80,-48]\n\nRow3: [39,-39,-89]\n\nSimilarly, minor20 is removing row2 and column0:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1]\n\nRow1: [-41,9,-9]\n\nRow3: [39,-39,-89]\n\nAnd minor30 is removing row3 and column0:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1]\n\nRow1: [-41,9,-9]\n\nRow2: [48,-80,-48]\n\nSo, now, let's compute each minor.\n\nFirst, minor00:\n\n[\n[-41,9,-9],\n[48,-80,-48],\n[39,-39,-89]\n]\n\nCompute det(minor00):\n\nUsing the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion.\n\nLet me expand along the first row:\n\n-41 * det([[-80, -48], [-39, -89]]) - 9 * det([[48, -48], [39, -89]]) + (-9) * det([[48, -80], [39, -39]])\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: -41 * [ (-80)(-89) - (-48)(-39) ]\n\n= -41 * [7120 - 1872] \n\n= -41 * [5248]\n\n= -41 * 5248\n\nWait, 5248 divided by 16 is 328, 5248 = 16 * 328. Hmm, but maybe compute 41 * 5248:\n\n41 * 5248: 40*5248=209,920; 1*5248=5,248. Sum: 215,168. So first term is -215,168.\n\nSecond term: -9 * [48*(-89) - (-48)*39]\n\n= -9 * [ -4272 + 1872 ]\n\n= -9 * (-2400)\n\n= 21,600\n\nThird term: (-9) * [48*(-39) - (-80)*39 ]\n\n= (-9) * [ -1,872 + 3,120 ]\n\n= (-9) * (1,248)\n\n= -11,232\n\nSo det(minor00) = -215,168 + 21,600 -11,232\n\n= (-215,168) + (21,600 -11,232)\n\n= (-215,168) + (10,368)\n\n= -204,800\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations step by step.\n\nFirst term:\n\n-41 * [ (-80)*(-89) - (-48)*(-39) ]\n\n= -41 * [7120 - 1872]\n\n= -41 * 5248\n\nCompute 41 * 5000 = 205,000\n\n41 * 248 = 10,168\n\nTotal 205,000 +10,168=215,168\n\nSo, first term is -215,168.\n\nSecond term:\n\n-9 * [48*(-89) - (-48)*39 ]\n\n= -9 * [ -4272 + 1872 ]\n\n= -9 * (-2400) = +21,600.\n\nThird term:\n\n-9 * [48*(-39) - (-80)*39 ]\n\n= -9 * [ -1,872 + 3,120 ]\n\n= -9 * (1,248) = -11,232.\n\nSo total det(minor00) = -215,168 + 21,600 -11,232\n\n= (-215,168) + (21,600 -11,232) \n\n21,600 -11,232 = 10,368\n\nSo total: -215,168 +10,368 = -204,800.\n\nOkay, so det(minor00) = -204,800.\n\nNext, minor10:\n\n[\n[1,1,1],\n[48,-80,-48],\n[39,-39,-89]\n]\n\nCompute det(minor10). Let's expand along the first row.\n\n1 * det([[-80,-48], [-39,-89]]) -1 * det([[48,-48], [39,-89]]) +1 * det([[48,-80], [39,-39]])\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1 * [ (-80)(-89) - (-48)(-39) ]\n\n= 1 * [7120 - 1872] = 1 * 5248 = 5248\n\nSecond term: -1 * [48*(-89) - (-48)*39 ]\n\n= -1 * [ -4272 + 1872 ] = -1 * (-2400) = 2400\n\nThird term: 1 * [48*(-39) - (-80)*39 ]\n\n= 1 * [ -1872 + 3120 ] = 1 * 1248 = 1248\n\nSo det(minor10) = 5248 + 2400 + 1248 = 5248 + 2400 = 7648; 7648 + 1248 = 8896.\n\nWait, 5248 + 2400 is 7648, plus 1248 is 8896. So det(minor10) = 8896.\n\nWait, but the cofactor is (-1)^{1+1} * 8896, but since we are expanding the determinant, it's just 8896.\n\nWait, no, in the expansion, the sign is determined by the position. Since we're expanding the determinant, it's 1 * det(...) -1 * det(...) +1 * det(...), so the signs are correct as above.\n\nSo det(minor10) = 5248 + 2400 + 1248 = 8896.\n\nNow, moving on to minor20:\n\n[\n[1,1,1],\n[-41,9,-9],\n[39,-39,-89]\n]\n\nCompute det(minor20). Let's expand along the first row.\n\n1 * det([[9, -9], [-39, -89]]) -1 * det([[-41, -9], [39, -89]]) +1 * det([[-41,9], [39,-39]])\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1 * [9*(-89) - (-9)*(-39)]\n\n= 1 * [ -801 - 351 ] = 1 * (-1152) = -1152\n\nSecond term: -1 * [ (-41)*(-89) - (-9)*39 ]\n\n= -1 * [ 3649 - (-351) ] = -1 * (3649 + 351) = -1 * 4000 = -4000\n\nThird term: 1 * [ (-41)*(-39) - 9*39 ]\n\n= 1 * [ 1599 - 351 ] = 1 * 1248 = 1248\n\nSo det(minor20) = -1152 -4000 + 1248\n\n= (-1152 -4000) +1248 = (-5152) +1248 = -3904.\n\nWait, let's check the calculations.\n\nFirst term:\n\n[9*(-89) - (-9)*(-39)] = (-801) - (351) = -1152. Correct.\n\nSecond term:\n\n[ (-41)*(-89) - (-9)*39 ] = 3649 - (-351) = 3649 + 351 = 4000. So -1 * 4000 = -4000. Correct.\n\nThird term:\n\n[ (-41)*(-39) - 9*39 ] = 1599 - 351 = 1248. Correct.\n\nSo det(minor20) = -1152 -4000 +1248 = -3904.\n\nLastly, minor30:\n\n[\n[1,1,1],\n[-41,9,-9],\n[48,-80,-48]\n]\n\nCompute det(minor30). Let's expand along the first row.\n\n1 * det([[9, -9], [-80, -48]]) -1 * det([[-41, -9], [48, -48]]) +1 * det([[-41,9], [48,-80]])\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1 * [9*(-48) - (-9)*(-80) ]\n\n= 1 * [ -432 - 720 ] = 1 * (-1152) = -1152\n\nSecond term: -1 * [ (-41)*(-48) - (-9)*48 ]\n\n= -1 * [ 1968 - (-432) ] = -1 * (1968 + 432) = -1 * 2400 = -2400\n\nThird term: 1 * [ (-41)*(-80) -9*48 ]\n\n= 1 * [3280 - 432] = 1 * 2848 = 2848\n\nSo det(minor30) = -1152 -2400 +2848\n\n= (-1152 -2400) +2848 = (-3552) +2848 = -704.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\nFirst term: 9*(-48) = -432; (-9)*(-80)=720. So -432 -720 = -1152. Correct.\n\nSecond term: (-41)*(-48)=1968; (-9)*48= -432. So 1968 - (-432)= 1968 +432=2400. So -1 * 2400= -2400. Correct.\n\nThird term: (-41)*(-80)=3280; 9*48=432. So 3280 -432=2848. Correct.\n\nSo det(minor30)= -1152 -2400 +2848= -704.\n\nPutting it all together, the determinant of M10 is:\n\n1*(-204800) -41*(8896) +80*(-3904) -89*(-704)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1*(-204800) = -204800\n\n-41*(8896) = let's compute 40*8896=355,840; 1*8896=8,896. So total 355,840 +8,896= 364,736. So -41*8896= -364,736.\n\n80*(-3904)= -80*3904= -312,320.\n\n-89*(-704)=89*704. Let's compute:\n\n700*89=62,300; 4*89=356. So total 62,300 +356=62,656.\n\nSo, total determinant:\n\n-204,800 -364,736 -312,320 +62,656\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nFirst, -204,800 -364,736 = -(204,800 +364,736) = -569,536.\n\nThen, -569,536 -312,320 = -(569,536 +312,320) = -881,856.\n\nThen, -881,856 +62,656 = -(881,856 -62,656) = -(819,200) = -819,200.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, 62,656 is positive, so:\n\n-881,856 +62,656 = (-881,856 +62,656) = (-881,856 +62,656) = -819,200.\n\nSo det(M10) = -819,200.\n\nWait, no. Because the expansion was:\n\ndet(M10) = 1*(-204800) -41*(8896) +80*(-3904) -89*(-704)\n\n= (-204,800) - (41*8896) + (80*(-3904)) + (89*704)\n\nWait, no: the signs are as per cofactor expansion:\n\n= 1*(-204800) -41*(8896) +80*(-3904) -89*(-704)\n\nWait, no: the formula is:\n\ndet = a11*M11 - a12*M12 + a13*M13 - a14*M14\n\nIn our case, the first row is [1,1,1,1], so:\n\ndet = 1*M11 -1*M12 +1*M13 -1*M14\n\nWhich corresponds to:\n\n1*det(minor00) -1*det(minor10) +1*det(minor20) -1*det(minor30)\n\nSo,\n\n= 1*(-204800) -1*(8896) +1*(-3904) -1*(-704)\n\n= -204,800 -8,896 -3,904 +704\n\nCompute:\n\n-204,800 -8,896 = -213,696\n\n-213,696 -3,904 = -217,600\n\n-217,600 +704 = -216,896\n\nSo det(M10) = -216,896.\n\nWait, that's different from before. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in the expansion.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial expansion was:\n\ndet = 1*(-204800) -41*(8896) +80*(-3904) -89*(-704)\n\nBut that's not correct. Because in the expansion, the coefficients are based on the position, not the value.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the expansion is:\n\ndet(M10) = 1 * det(minor00) -1 * det(minor10) +1 * det(minor20) -1 * det(minor30)\n\nSo, det(M10) = (-204800) - (8896) + (-3904) - (-704)\n\n= (-204,800) -8,896 -3,904 +704\n\nCompute:\n\n-204,800 -8,896 = -213,696\n\n-213,696 -3,904 = -217,600\n\n-217,600 +704 = -216,896.\n\nSo det(M10) = -216,896.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was -819,200, but that was a mistake because I misapplied the coefficients.\n\nSo, det(M10) = -216,896.\n\nBut then, det(CM) = -det(M10) = -(-216,896) = 216,896.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, earlier, det(CM) = -det(M10). Because in the expansion, det(CM) = (-1)^{1+0} * 1 * det(M10) = -det(M10).\n\nSo, det(CM) = -det(M10) = -(-216,896) = 216,896.\n\nSo, det(CM) = 216,896.\n\nThen, the volume V is sqrt(det(CM)/288).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the formula is V^2 = det(CM)/288.\n\nSo,\n\nV^2 = 216,896 / 288.\n\nSimplify 216,896 / 288.\n\nLet me compute 216,896 \u00f7 288.\n\nFirst, let's see how many times 288 goes into 216,896.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16:\n\n216,896 \u00f716=13,556\n\n288 \u00f716=18\n\nSo 13,556 /18.\n\nCompute 13,556 \u00f718:\n\n18 * 750 = 13,500.\n\n13,556 -13,500=56.\n\n56 \u00f718=3.111...\n\nWait, 56=18*3 + 2.\n\nSo 13,556 /18=750 + 3 + 2/18=753 + 1/9.\n\nSo 753.111...\n\nBut let me compute it as fractions.\n\n13,556 /18 = (13,556 \u00f72)/(18 \u00f72)=6,778/9.\n\n6,778 \u00f79: 9*753=6,777, so 6,778=9*753 +1.\n\nSo 6,778/9=753 +1/9.\n\nSo V^2=753 +1/9=753.111...\n\nWait, but 216,896 /288= 216,896 /288.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute GCD(216,896, 288).\n\nFind GCD(216896, 288).\n\nDivide 216896 by 288:\n\n288*750=216,000.\n\n216,896 -216,000=896.\n\nNow, GCD(288,896).\n\nDivide 896 by288:\n\n288*3=864. 896-864=32.\n\nGCD(288,32).\n\n288 \u00f732=9, remainder 0. So GCD is 32.\n\nSo, divide numerator and denominator by32.\n\n216,896 \u00f732=6,778.\n\n288 \u00f732=9.\n\nSo, 216,896 /288=6,778/9.\n\nSo V^2=6,778/9.\n\nSo V= sqrt(6778/9)=sqrt(6778)/3.\n\nWait, but 6,778 is even, divide by2: 3,389. Is 3,389 a square? Let me see.\n\n3,389: sqrt is about 58.22. 58^2=3,364; 59^2=3,481. So between 58 and 59, not a square. So V= sqrt(6778)/3.\n\nWait, but 6778=2*3389. 3389 is a prime? Let me check.\n\n3389: It's not even, not divisible by 3 (3+3+8+9=23, not divisible by3). Let's try dividing by 7: 3389 \u00f77=484.142..., no. 7*484=3388, so 3389-3388=1, so remainder 1. Not divisible by7.\n\n11: 3-3+8-9= -1, not divisible by11.\n\n13: 3389 \u00f713=260.692, not integer.\n\n17: 3389 \u00f717\u2248199.35. 17*199=3383, 3389-3383=6, so no.\n\n19: 3389 \u00f719\u2248178.368, nope.\n\n23: 3389 \u00f723\u2248147.347, nope.\n\n29: 3389 \u00f729\u2248116.862, nope.\n\n31: 3389 \u00f731\u2248109.322, nope.\n\nSo 3389 is a prime number. So sqrt(6778)=sqrt(2*3389). So V= sqrt(2*3389)/3.\n\nHmm, but that seems complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in computing the determinant.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nEarlier, when I computed det(M10), I got -216,896. Then det(CM)= -det(M10)=216,896.\n\nThen V^2=216,896 /288= (216,896 \u00f716)/(288 \u00f716)=13,556 /18=753.111...\n\nWait, but 216,896 \u00f7288=753.111...\n\nWait, 753.111... is 753 + 1/9.\n\nWait, 753.111...=753 + 1/9= (753*9 +1)/9= (6,777 +1)/9=6,778/9.\n\nSo V^2=6,778/9, so V= sqrt(6778/9)=sqrt(6778)/3.\n\nHmm, okay. So the volume is sqrt(6778)/3. Maybe we can keep it as is for now.\n\nNext, compute the total surface area S.\n\nThe tetrahedron has four triangular faces. Each face is a triangle with sides given by the edge lengths.\n\nLooking at the edge lengths:\n\nEach face is a triangle with sides:\n\n- Face ABC: AB=\u221a41, AC=\u221a80, BC=\u221a89\n- Face ABD: AB=\u221a41, AD=\u221a89, BD=\u221a80\n- Face ACD: AC=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89, CD=\u221a41\n- Face BCD: BC=\u221a89, BD=\u221a80, CD=\u221a41\n\nWait, all four faces have the same set of edge lengths: two sides of \u221a41, \u221a80, and \u221a89. So all four faces are congruent triangles.\n\nSo, each face has sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89.\n\nSo, the area of each face is the same. Let's compute the area of one face and multiply by four.\n\nCompute area of triangle with sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nUse Heron's formula: area = sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)], where s=(a+b+c)/2.\n\nCompute s:\n\ns = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2.\n\nBut this might be complicated. Alternatively, check if it's a right triangle.\n\nCheck if a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2=41, b\u00b2=80, c\u00b2=89.\n\n41 +80=121, which is not equal to 89. So not a right triangle.\n\nAlternatively, compute the area using Heron's formula.\n\nBut computing sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)] is messy with square roots.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt[(a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)]\n\nBut same thing.\n\nWait, perhaps compute s^2, (s -a)^2, etc.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the area using vectors or coordinates.\n\nWait, maybe assign coordinates to the tetrahedron to compute the areas.\n\nSince the tetrahedron is symmetric, perhaps it can be embedded in coordinate system in a symmetric way.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the vertices.\n\nLet me denote the points as A, B, C, D.\n\nLet me assume point A is at (x, y, z), B at (p, q, r), etc. But that might be too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe place the tetrahedron so that the midpoints or something are at the origin.\n\nWait, another approach: since all opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron is \"equifacial\", meaning all faces are congruent. But in this case, all faces have the same side lengths, so yes, they are congruent triangles. So all four faces have the same area.\n\nSo, compute the area of one face, say ABC.\n\nCompute sides: AB=\u221a41, AC=\u221a80, BC=\u221a89.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s:\n\ns = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2.\n\nCompute s:\n\nBut this is messy, so maybe compute numerically.\n\nCompute approximate values:\n\n\u221a41\u22486.4031\n\n\u221a80\u22488.9443\n\n\u221a89\u22489.4336\n\nSo s\u2248(6.4031 +8.9443 +9.4336)/2\u2248(24.780)/2\u224812.39.\n\nThen, area\u2248sqrt[12.39*(12.39 -6.4031)*(12.39 -8.9443)*(12.39 -9.4336)]\n\nCompute each term:\n\n12.39 -6.4031\u22485.9869\n\n12.39 -8.9443\u22483.4457\n\n12.39 -9.4336\u22482.9564\n\nSo,\n\nArea\u2248sqrt(12.39 *5.9869 *3.4457 *2.9564)\n\nCompute the product inside sqrt:\n\nFirst, 12.39 *5.9869\u224812.39 *6\u224874.34, but more accurately:\n\n12.39 *5.9869\u224812*5.9869=71.8428; 0.39*5.9869\u22482.335. Total\u224874.1778.\n\nThen, 3.4457 *2.9564\u22483.4457*3\u224810.3371, minus 3.4457*(0.0436)=\u22480.150. So\u224810.187.\n\nThen, 74.1778 *10.187\u224874.1778*10=741.778; 74.1778*0.187\u224813.87. Total\u2248741.778 +13.87\u2248755.648.\n\nSo area\u2248sqrt(755.648)\u224827.5.\n\nBut this is approximate. Let me see if I can compute it exactly.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt[(a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)]\n\nSo,\n\nArea^2 = (1/16)*(a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)\n\nCompute each term:\n\na + b + c=\u221a41 +\u221a80 +\u221a89.\n\n-a + b + c= -\u221a41 +\u221a80 +\u221a89.\n\na - b + c=\u221a41 -\u221a80 +\u221a89.\n\na + b - c=\u221a41 +\u221a80 -\u221a89.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe multiply them in pairs.\n\nLet me compute (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)= [ (\u221a80 +\u221a89)^2 - (\u221a41)^2 ].\n\nSimilarly, (a - b + c)(a + b - c)= [ (\u221a41 +\u221a89)^2 - (\u221a80)^2 ].\n\nSo,\n\nFirst pair: (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)= (b + c)^2 -a^2= (sqrt80 +sqrt89)^2 -41.\n\nCompute:\n\n(sqrt80 +sqrt89)^2=80 + 2*sqrt(80*89) +89=169 + 2*sqrt(7120).\n\nSo, (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)=169 + 2*sqrt(7120) -41=128 + 2*sqrt(7120).\n\nSecond pair: (a - b + c)(a + b - c)= (a + c)^2 - b^2= (sqrt41 +sqrt89)^2 -80.\n\nCompute:\n\n(sqrt41 +sqrt89)^2=41 + 2*sqrt(41*89) +89=130 + 2*sqrt(3649).\n\nSo, (a - b + c)(a + b - c)=130 + 2*sqrt(3649) -80=50 + 2*sqrt(3649).\n\nSo, Area^2=(1/16)*(128 + 2*sqrt(7120))*(50 + 2*sqrt(3649)).\n\nLet me compute this product.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nTerm1=128 + 2*sqrt(7120)=2*(64 + sqrt(7120)).\n\nTerm2=50 + 2*sqrt(3649)=2*(25 + sqrt(3649)).\n\nSo,\n\nTerm1*Term2= [2*(64 + sqrt(7120))] * [2*(25 + sqrt(3649))] =4*(64 + sqrt(7120))*(25 + sqrt(3649)).\n\nCompute (64 + sqrt(7120))*(25 + sqrt(3649)).\n\n=64*25 +64*sqrt(3649) +25*sqrt(7120) + sqrt(7120)*sqrt(3649).\n\n=1600 +64*sqrt(3649) +25*sqrt(7120) + sqrt(7120*3649).\n\nCompute sqrt(7120*3649). Let me compute 7120*3649.\n\nBut 7120=16*445, 3649= let me see, 3649 \u00f713=280.69, not integer. 3649 \u00f77=521.285, nope. Maybe it's a square?\n\nWait, sqrt(3649)= approx 60.407. 60^2=3600, 61^2=3721. So not a square.\n\nSimilarly, 7120=16*445=16*5*89=80*89.\n\nWait, 7120=80*89, 3649=?\n\nWait, 3649: 3649 \u00f789=41. Let me check: 89*41=3649. Yes, because 89*40=3560, plus 89=3649.\n\nSo 3649=89*41.\n\nSo sqrt(7120*3649)=sqrt(80*89 *89*41)=sqrt(80 *89^2 *41)=89*sqrt(80*41)=89*sqrt(3280).\n\nHmm, 3280=16*205=16*5*41.

So, going back,\n\ndet(Minor10) after factoring out -1 is (-1)*2848= -2848.\n\nSo, det(CM_t)= -2848.\n\nBut wait, Cayley-Menger determinant for the triangle is 288 * Area\u00b2. So,\n\n288 * Area\u00b2 = |det(CM_t)|=2848.\n\nWait, but det(CM_t)= -2848, but the determinant's absolute value is 2848.\n\nSo,\n\nArea\u00b2=2848 /288=2848 \u00f7 288.\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16:\n\n2848 \u00f716=178\n\n288 \u00f716=18\n\nSo, Area\u00b2=178/18=89/9.\n\nSo, Area= sqrt(89/9)=sqrt(89)/3.\n\nAh! So, each face has area sqrt(89)/3.\n\nTherefore, total surface area S=4*(sqrt(89)/3)=4sqrt(89)/3.\n\nSo, S=4\u221a89 /3.\n\nGreat, so now we have V and S.\n\nEarlier, we found V= sqrt(6778)/3.\n\nWait, but 6778=2*3389, and 3389 is a prime.\n\nWait, but let me check: 6778=2*3389.\n\nSo, V= sqrt(2*3389)/3.\n\nHmm, but maybe 3389 is 89*38.1, but 89*38=3382, so no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 6778=89*76.2, not integer.\n\nSo, V= sqrt(2*3389)/3.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier in computing the determinant.\n\nWait, let me recheck the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nWait, det(CM) was computed as 216,896, so V^2=216,896 /288=753.111..., which is 6,778/9.\n\nSo V= sqrt(6,778)/3.\n\nBut 6,778=2*3,389. So, sqrt(2*3,389)/3.\n\nBut 3,389 is a prime, so it can't be simplified.\n\nBut wait, the area of each face is sqrt(89)/3, which is nice, but the volume is messy.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in computing the determinant.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nIn the initial step, when I computed the Cayley-Menger determinant, I ended up with det(CM)=216,896, which gave V^2=216,896/288=753.111...\n\nBut when I computed the area of a face using the Cayley-Menger determinant, I got det(CM_t)=2848, so Area= sqrt(89)/3.\n\nWait, maybe the tetrahedron is regular? But no, because the edge lengths are not equal.\n\nWait, but all faces are congruent. So it's an isohedral tetrahedron.\n\nBut the volume is still messy.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a better way to compute the volume.\n\nAlternatively, since all four faces are congruent, maybe the tetrahedron is isohedral, and thus the inradius can be found via formula.\n\nWait, the formula for inradius is r=3V/S.\n\nSo, if I can find V, I can find r.\n\nBut I have V^2=6,778/9, so V= sqrt(6,778)/3.\n\nWait, 6,778=2*3,389.\n\nBut maybe 3,389=89*38.1, which it's not. So, perhaps 6,778=89*76.2, which is not integer.\n\nWait, 6,778 \u00f789=76.2, which is 76.2.\n\nBut 89*76=6,764. 6,778-6,764=14. So 6,778=89*76 +14. Not helpful.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to accept that V= sqrt(6,778)/3.\n\nWait, but 6,778=89*76.2, which is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the determinant computation.\n\nEarlier, I computed det(CM)=216,896. But let me check the steps again.\n\nFirst, in the Cayley-Menger matrix:\n\nRow0:0,1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow2:1,41,0,89,80\n\nRow3:1,80,89,0,41\n\nRow4:1,89,80,41,0\n\nThen, I performed row operations: subtracted Row1 from Rows2,3,4.\n\nGot Row2':0,41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow3':0,80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow4':0,89,39,-39,-89\n\nThen, expanded along column0, which had only 1 in Row1, leading to det(CM)= -det(M10).\n\nThen, computed det(M10) as -216,896, so det(CM)=216,896.\n\nBut when I computed the face area using the Cayley-Menger determinant, I got Area= sqrt(89)/3, which seems correct.\n\nBut the volume is giving me a hard time.\n\nWait, maybe 6,778 is 89*76.2, but perhaps 6,778=89*76 +14, but 14 is 2*7. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps 6,778=41*165.317. Hmm, no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the determinant.\n\nWait, let me recompute det(M10).\n\nEarlier, I found det(M10)=-216,896, leading to det(CM)=216,896.\n\nBut when I computed the face area, I found that each face has area sqrt(89)/3.\n\nGiven that all four faces are congruent, and the inradius is the same for each face, perhaps there's a relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the formula for the inradius in terms of the volume and surface area.\n\nr=3V/S.\n\nSo, if I have V and S, I can compute r.\n\nGiven that S=4*sqrt(89)/3.\n\nAnd V= sqrt(6,778)/3.\n\nSo,\n\nr= 3*(sqrt(6,778)/3) / (4*sqrt(89)/3) )= sqrt(6,778)/(4*sqrt(89)/3)= 3*sqrt(6,778)/(4*sqrt(89)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(6,778)/sqrt(89)=sqrt(6,778/89)=sqrt(76.202).\n\nWait, 6,778 \u00f789=76.202.\n\nWait, 89*76=6,764. 6,778-6,764=14.\n\nSo, 6,778=89*76 +14.\n\nHmm, 76.202=76 +14/89.\n\nSo, sqrt(76 +14/89)=sqrt(76.202).\n\nNot helpful.\n\nWait, but 6,778=2*3,389.\n\nAnd 3,389 \u00f789=38.1, which is 38 + 1/10.\n\nHmm, maybe 3,389=89*38 + 17.\n\n89*38=3,382. 3,389-3,382=7.\n\nSo, 3,389=89*38 +7.\n\nSo, 6,778=2*(89*38 +7)=89*76 +14.\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use another method to compute the volume.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute the volume using the areas and dihedral angles, but that seems complicated.\n\nWait, another approach: since all four faces are congruent triangles, the tetrahedron is isohedral, so all edges are equal in some symmetric way.\n\nWait, but in our case, the edges are not all equal, but opposite edges are equal.\n\nWait, perhaps the tetrahedron can be inscribed in a rectangular box.\n\nI recall that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it can be embedded in a box such that each edge corresponds to a face diagonal.\n\nYes, that might work.\n\nSo, let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices such that:\n\nLet the tetrahedron be ABCD, with AB=CD=\u221a41, AC=BD=\u221a80, AD=BC=\u221a89.\n\nAssume that the edges correspond to face diagonals of a box.\n\nLet me denote the box with side lengths a, b, c.\n\nThen, the edges of the tetrahedron can be represented as face diagonals:\n\nAB:\u221a(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2)=\u221a41 \u21d2a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=41\n\nAC:\u221a(a\u00b2 +c\u00b2)=\u221a80 \u21d2a\u00b2 +c\u00b2=80\n\nAD:\u221a(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2)=\u221a89 \u21d2b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=89\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\n1. a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =41\n\n2. a\u00b2 +c\u00b2=80\n\n3. b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=89\n\nWe can solve for a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2.\n\nSubtract equation1 from equation2:\n\n(c\u00b2 -b\u00b2)=39.\n\nFrom equation3: b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=89.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nc\u00b2 -b\u00b2=39\n\nc\u00b2 +b\u00b2=89\n\nAdd both equations:\n\n2c\u00b2=128 \u21d2c\u00b2=64 \u21d2c=8.\n\nThen, from c\u00b2 -b\u00b2=39 \u21d264 -b\u00b2=39 \u21d2b\u00b2=25 \u21d2b=5.\n\nFrom equation1: a\u00b2 +25=41 \u21d2a\u00b2=16 \u21d2a=4.\n\nSo, a=4, b=5, c=8.\n\nSo, the tetrahedron can be embedded in a box with side lengths 4,5,8.\n\nSo, now, the volume of the tetrahedron is V= (a*b*c)/3= (4*5*8)/3=160/3.\n\nWait, that's much simpler!\n\nSo, V=160/3.\n\nWait, why didn't I think of this earlier? Because I was trying to compute the Cayley-Menger determinant which got complicated, but using the box method gives the volume directly.\n\nSo, V= (4*5*8)/3=160/3.\n\nNow, that makes things much easier.\n\nEarlier, I computed the area of each face as sqrt(89)/3, which is correct.\n\nSo, total surface area S=4*(sqrt(89)/3)=4sqrt(89)/3.\n\nSo, the inradius r=3V/S=3*(160/3)/(4sqrt(89)/3)= (160)/(4sqrt(89)/3)= (160*3)/(4sqrt(89))= (480)/(4sqrt(89))=120/sqrt(89).\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\n120/sqrt(89)= (120*sqrt(89))/89= (120\u221a89)/89.\n\nSimplify 120 and 89: 89 is prime, 120=8*15=8*3*5. So, no common factors.\n\nSo, r=120\u221a89 /89.\n\nBut the problem states that the distance can be written as m\u221an /p, with m and p coprime, and n square-free.\n\nHere, m=120, n=89, p=89.\n\nCheck if m and p are coprime: 120 and 89. 89 is prime, 89 does not divide 120, so yes.\n\nn=89 is a prime, so it's square-free.\n\nThus, the distance is 120\u221a89 /89.\n\nSo, m=120, n=89, p=89.\n\nThus, m +n +p=120 +89 +89= 298.\n\nWait, but 120 +89 is 209, plus 89 is 298.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed V via Cayley-Menger, I got V= sqrt(6,778)/3\u2248sqrt(6778)/3\u224882.34/3\u224827.45, but using the box method, V=160/3\u224853.33. These are different.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, the box method is more reliable because it's a standard formula for such tetrahedrons.\n\nWait, in the box method, the volume is (a*b*c)/3. So, with a=4, b=5, c=8, V= (4*5*8)/3=160/3\u224853.33.\n\nBut earlier via Cayley-Menger, I had V\u2248sqrt(6778)/3\u2248sqrt(6778)=82.34, so 82.34/3\u224827.45.\n\nSo, these are conflicting results. So, I must have made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nWait, the box method is correct because it's a standard result for such tetrahedrons with opposite edges equal.\n\nSo, why did I get a different volume via Cayley-Menger determinant?\n\nBecause I must have made a mistake in the computation.\n\nSo, perhaps the Cayley-Menger determinant is giving me the wrong volume, which suggests that I made an error in the calculation.\n\nGiven that the box method is straightforward and gives V=160/3, I should trust that.\n\nSo, proceed with V=160/3 and S=4\u221a89/3.\n\nSo, inradius r=3V/S=3*(160/3)/(4\u221a89/3)= (160)/(4\u221a89/3)= (160*3)/(4\u221a89)= (480)/(4\u221a89)=120/\u221a89= (120\u221a89)/89.\n\nSo, r=120\u221a89 /89.\n\nThus, m=120, n=89, p=89. m +n +p=120+89+89=298.\n\nSo, the answer is 298.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{298}\n",

We assign the edge lengths as face diagonals of a box with side lengths \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):\n\n1. \\(AB = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\sqrt{41}\\) implies \\(a^2 + b^2 = 41\\).\n2. \\(AC = \\sqrt{a^2 + c^2} = \\sqrt{80}\\) implies \\(a^2 + c^2 = 80\\).\n3. \\(AD = \\sqrt{b^2 + c^2} = \\sqrt{89}\\) implies \\(b^2 + c^2 = 89\\).\n\nSolving these equations, we find:\n- Subtracting the first equation from the second: \\(c^2 - b^2 = 39\\).\n- Adding this result to the third equation: \\(2c^2 = 128 \\implies c^2 = 64 \\implies c = 8\\).\n- Substituting \\(c = 8\\) back, we find \\(b^2 = 25 \\implies b = 5\\) and \\(a^2 = 16 \\implies a = 4\\).\n\nThe volume \\(V\\) of the tetrahedron is calculated as:\n\\[ V = \\frac{abc}{3} = \\frac{4 \\times 5 \\times 8}{3} = \\frac{160}{3} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the area of one face. Each face is a triangle with sides \\(\\sqrt{41}\\), \\(\\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{89}\\). Using Heron's formula, we find the area of one face is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{89}}{3}\\). The total surface area \\(S\\) is:\n\\[ S = 4 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{89}}{3} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{89}}{3} \\]\n\nThe inradius \\(r\\) is given by:\n\\[ r = \\frac{3V}{S} = \\frac{3 \\times \\frac{160}{3}}{\\frac{4\\sqrt{89}}{3}} = \\frac{160}{\\frac{4\\sqrt{89}}{3}} = \\frac{160 \\times 3}{4\\sqrt{89}} = \\frac{480}{4\\sqrt{89}} = \\frac{120}{\\sqrt{89}} = \\frac{120\\sqrt{89}}{89} \\]\n\nThus, the distance is \\(\\frac{120\\sqrt{89}}{89}\\), where \\(m = 120\\), \\(n = 89\\), and \\(p = 89\\). Therefore, \\(m + n + p = 120 + 89 + 89 = 298\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{298}\n\\]",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance is supposed to be in the form m\u221an / p, and then I have to find m + n + p.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the tetrahedron. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces, and the incenter is the point where the four \"bisectors\" meet, similar to the incenter in a triangle. The distance from this point to each face is the same, and that's what we're looking for.\n\nGiven the edge lengths:\n\n- AB = CD = \u221a41\n- AC = BD = \u221a80\n- BC = AD = \u221a89\n\nHmm, this looks symmetric in some way. It seems like opposite edges are equal. So AB equals CD, AC equals BD, and BC equals AD. That symmetry might be useful. Maybe this tetrahedron is \"isohedral\" or something? Or perhaps it's a kind of \"kite\" tetrahedron? Not sure, but the symmetry might help in calculations.\n\nI remember that in a tetrahedron, the volume can be found if we know the edge lengths, but it's a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can find the volume using another method because of the symmetry.\n\nWait, the problem is about the inradius. The formula for the inradius r of a tetrahedron is r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So I need to find V and S.\n\nSo, let's plan:\n\n1. Find the volume V of the tetrahedron.\n2. Find the total surface area S.\n3. Compute r = 3V / S.\n4. Express r in the required form and compute m + n + p.\n\nFirst, how to find the volume? One way is to use the Cayley-Menger determinant. I remember that for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, the volume can be calculated using a determinant. Let me recall the formula.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   AB\u00b2 AC\u00b2 AD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AB\u00b2  0   BC\u00b2 BD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AC\u00b2 BC\u00b2  0   CD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AD\u00b2 BD\u00b2 CD\u00b2  0  |\n\nThe determinant of this matrix divided by 288 gives the square of the volume.\n\nSo, let me assign the edge lengths:\n\nAB = \u221a41, so AB\u00b2 = 41\n\nAC = \u221a80, AC\u00b2 = 80\n\nAD = \u221a89, AD\u00b2 = 89\n\nBC = \u221a89, BC\u00b2 = 89\n\nBD = \u221a80, BD\u00b2 = 80\n\nCD = \u221a41, CD\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo the Cayley-Menger determinant matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nNow, I need to compute this determinant.\n\nLet me denote the matrix as CM with rows and columns 0 to 4.\n\nCM[0][0] = 0; CM[0][1]=1; CM[0][2]=1; CM[0][3]=1; CM[0][4]=1\n\nCM[1][0] = 1; CM[1][1]=0; CM[1][2]=41; CM[1][3]=80; CM[1][4]=89\n\nCM[2][0] = 1; CM[2][1]=41; CM[2][2]=0; CM[2][3]=89; CM[2][4]=80\n\nCM[3][0] = 1; CM[3][1]=80; CM[3][2]=89; CM[3][3]=0; CM[3][4]=41\n\nCM[4][0] = 1; CM[4][1]=89; CM[4][2]=80; CM[4][3]=41; CM[4][4]=0\n\nComputing a 5x5 determinant manually is a bit tedious, but maybe there's some symmetry or pattern that can help.\n\nLooking at the matrix, rows 1 and 2 are similar, as are rows 3 and 4. Similarly for columns.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1,41, 0, 89,80\n\nRow 3: 1,80,89,0,41\n\nRow 4: 1,89,80,41,0\n\nIt looks like each row is a permutation of the same numbers, just rotated or something.\n\nWait, perhaps the matrix has some symmetry. Let me check if it's symmetric.\n\nCM[1][2] = 41, CM[2][1]=41: yes.\n\nCM[1][3]=80, CM[3][1]=80: yes.\n\nCM[1][4]=89, CM[4][1]=89: yes.\n\nSimilarly, CM[2][3]=89, CM[3][2]=89: yes.\n\nCM[2][4]=80, CM[4][2]=80: yes.\n\nCM[3][4]=41, CM[4][3]=41: yes.\n\nSo the matrix is symmetric. That might help in computing the determinant, but not sure how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can perform row or column operations to simplify the determinant.\n\nSince the determinant is linear in each row, and we can subtract rows to create zeros.\n\nLet me consider subtracting row 1 from rows 2, 3, 4.\n\nSo, define:\n\nRow 2' = Row2 - Row1\n\nRow 3' = Row3 - Row1\n\nRow 4' = Row4 - Row1\n\nSimilarly, maybe do the same for columns, but let's see.\n\nCompute Row2' = Row2 - Row1:\n\nRow2: 1,41,0,89,80\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nSo Row2' = [1-1, 41-0, 0-41, 89-80, 80-89] = [0,41,-41,9,-9]\n\nSimilarly, Row3' = Row3 - Row1:\n\nRow3:1,80,89,0,41\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow3' = [0,80,-41, -80, -48]\n\nWait, let me compute each element:\n\nRow3' = [1-1, 80-0, 89-41, 0-80, 41-89] = [0,80,48,-80,-48]\n\nSimilarly, Row4' = Row4 - Row1:\n\nRow4:1,89,80,41,0\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow4' = [0,89,-41, -39,-89]\n\nWait, let me compute each element:\n\nRow4' = [1-1,89-0,80-41,41-80,0-89] = [0,89,39,-39,-89]\n\nSo, now the matrix after row operations (only rows 2,3,4 changed) looks like:\n\nRow0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow1: 1, 0, 41,80,89\n\nRow2':0,41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow3':0,80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow4':0,89,39,-39,-89\n\nNow, the determinant remains the same, since we subtracted rows.\n\nNow, since the first column has 0s in rows 2',3',4', maybe expanding along the first column.\n\nThe determinant of a matrix can be expanded along a row or column. The first column has 0s in rows 2,3,4, except row1 and row0.\n\nWait, but row0 is [0,1,1,1,1], which complicates things. Maybe instead, let's consider that the first column is [0,1,0,0,0]^T. Wait, no, because after the row operations, rows 2,3,4 have 0 in the first element, but row1 is still 1.\n\nSo the first column is:\n\nRow0: 0\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2':0\n\nRow3':0\n\nRow4':0\n\nSo the only non-zero entry is in row1, column0: 1.\n\nSo when expanding the determinant along column0, only the minor from row1, column0 contributes.\n\nThe determinant is then (-1)^{1+0} * 1 * M10, where M10 is the minor matrix obtained by removing row1 and column0.\n\nSo M10 is the 4x4 matrix:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow2': [41,-41,9,-9]\n\nRow3': [80,48,-80,-48]\n\nRow4': [89,39,-39,-89]\n\nWait, let me make sure:\n\nOriginal matrix after row operations:\n\nRow0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow1:1, 0,41,80,89\n\nRow2':0,41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow3':0,80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow4':0,89,39,-39,-89\n\nSo, removing row1 and column0, we get the minor:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow2': [41,-41,9,-9]\n\nRow3': [80,48,-80,-48]\n\nRow4': [89,39,-39,-89]\n\nWait, but the minor is 4x4, so the rows are rows 0,2',3',4' of the original, and columns 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo the minor is:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow2': [41,-41,9,-9]\n\nRow3': [80,48,-80,-48]\n\nRow4': [89,39,-39,-89]\n\nSo the determinant is (-1)^{1+0} * 1 * det(M10) = -det(M10)\n\nSo det(CM) = -det(M10)\n\nSo now, I need to compute det(M10), which is a 4x4 determinant.\n\nHmm, this is still a bit complicated, but perhaps we can perform some row operations to simplify it.\n\nLooking at M10:\n\nRow0:1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow2:80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow3:89,39,-39,-89\n\nLet me try to subtract Row0 from Rows1,2,3 to create zeros.\n\nDefine:\n\nRow1' = Row1 - 41*Row0\n\nRow2' = Row2 - 80*Row0\n\nRow3' = Row3 - 89*Row0\n\nWait, but that might not be helpful because it could create large coefficients. Alternatively, maybe factor out common terms.\n\nLooking at Row1:41,-41,9,-9\n\nI notice that Row1 can be written as 41*(1,-1, 9/41, -9/41), but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor 41 from the first two elements, 3 from last two.\n\nWait, 41*(1, -1) + 3*(3, -3) = 41*(1,-1) + 3*(3,-3) = (41 +9, -41 -9) = (50, -50). Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, Row1:41, -41, 9, -9.\n\nSo the first two elements are 41 and -41, which is 41*(1, -1), and the last two are 9 and -9, which is 9*(1,-1). So Row1 = (41 + 0, -41 +0, 9 +0, -9 +0). Wait, no, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, factor out (1,-1) from the first two and last two.\n\nWait, maybe notice that Row1 is 41*(1, -1, 9/41, -9/41). Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to perform row operations to create zeros.\n\nAlternatively, maybe expand this determinant.\n\nBut 4x4 determinant is manageable, but time-consuming. Let's consider expanding along the first column.\n\nWait, in M10, the first column is [1,41,80,89]^T.\n\nSo expanding along the first column:\n\n1 * det(minor at 1,1) - 41 * det(minor at 2,1) + 80 * det(minor at 3,1) -89 * det(minor at4,1)\n\nWait, actually, the cofactor expansion is:\n\nsum_{i=1 to 4} (-1)^{i+1} * M[i][1] * det(minor i,1)\n\nSo, for M10:\n\nRow0:1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow2:80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow3:89,39,-39,-89\n\nSo, the determinant is:\n\n1 * det(minor at (0,0)) - 1 * det(minor at (0,1)) + 1 * det(minor at (0,2)) -1 * det(minor at (0,3))\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, I think I'm confusing the indices.\n\nWait, M10 is a 4x4 matrix:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow1: [41,-41,9,-9]\n\nRow2: [80,48,-80,-48]\n\nRow3: [89,39,-39,-89]\n\nSo, when expanding along the first column (column 0), the entries are:\n\nRow0:1, Row1:41, Row2:80, Row3:89.\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n1 * det(minor00) - 41 * det(minor10) + 80 * det(minor20) -89 * det(minor30)\n\nWhere minor00 is the 3x3 matrix obtained by removing row0 and column0:\n\nminor00:\nRow1: [-41,9,-9]\n\nRow2: [48,-80,-48]\n\nRow3: [39,-39,-89]\n\nSimilarly, minor10 is the matrix obtained by removing row1 and column0:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1]\n\nRow2: [80,-80,-48]\n\nRow3: [89,-39,-89]\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, minor10 is the minor for element (1,0), which is in row1, column0. So removing row1 and column0, the minor is:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1]\n\nRow2: [48,-80,-48]\n\nRow3: [39,-39,-89]\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, original M10:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow1: [41,-41,9,-9]\n\nRow2: [80,48,-80,-48]\n\nRow3: [89,39,-39,-89]\n\nSo minor10 is removing row1 and column0, so the remaining rows are row0, row2, row3, and columns 1,2,3.\n\nThus, minor10 is:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1]\n\nRow2: [48,-80,-48]\n\nRow3: [39,-39,-89]\n\nSimilarly, minor20 is removing row2 and column0:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1]\n\nRow1: [-41,9,-9]\n\nRow3: [39,-39,-89]\n\nAnd minor30 is removing row3 and column0:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1]\n\nRow1: [-41,9,-9]\n\nRow2: [48,-80,-48]\n\nSo, now, let's compute each minor.\n\nFirst, minor00:\n\n[\n[-41,9,-9],\n[48,-80,-48],\n[39,-39,-89]\n]\n\nCompute det(minor00):\n\nUsing the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion.\n\nLet me expand along the first row:\n\n-41 * det([[-80, -48], [-39, -89]]) - 9 * det([[48, -48], [39, -89]]) + (-9) * det([[48, -80], [39, -39]])\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: -41 * [ (-80)(-89) - (-48)(-39) ]\n\n= -41 * [7120 - 1872] \n\n= -41 * [5248]\n\n= -41 * 5248\n\nWait, 5248 divided by 16 is 328, 5248 = 16 * 328. Hmm, but maybe compute 41 * 5248:\n\n41 * 5248: 40*5248=209,920; 1*5248=5,248. Sum: 215,168. So first term is -215,168.\n\nSecond term: -9 * [48*(-89) - (-48)*39]\n\n= -9 * [ -4272 + 1872 ]\n\n= -9 * (-2400)\n\n= 21,600\n\nThird term: (-9) * [48*(-39) - (-80)*39 ]\n\n= (-9) * [ -1,872 + 3,120 ]\n\n= (-9) * (1,248)\n\n= -11,232\n\nSo det(minor00) = -215,168 + 21,600 -11,232\n\n= (-215,168) + (21,600 -11,232)\n\n= (-215,168) + (10,368)\n\n= -204,800\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations step by step.\n\nFirst term:\n\n-41 * [ (-80)*(-89) - (-48)*(-39) ]\n\n= -41 * [7120 - 1872]\n\n= -41 * 5248\n\nCompute 41 * 5000 = 205,000\n\n41 * 248 = 10,168\n\nTotal 205,000 +10,168=215,168\n\nSo, first term is -215,168.\n\nSecond term:\n\n-9 * [48*(-89) - (-48)*39 ]\n\n= -9 * [ -4272 + 1872 ]\n\n= -9 * (-2400) = +21,600.\n\nThird term:\n\n-9 * [48*(-39) - (-80)*39 ]\n\n= -9 * [ -1,872 + 3,120 ]\n\n= -9 * (1,248) = -11,232.\n\nSo total det(minor00) = -215,168 + 21,600 -11,232\n\n= (-215,168) + (21,600 -11,232) \n\n21,600 -11,232 = 10,368\n\nSo total: -215,168 +10,368 = -204,800.\n\nOkay, so det(minor00) = -204,800.\n\nNext, minor10:\n\n[\n[1,1,1],\n[48,-80,-48],\n[39,-39,-89]\n]\n\nCompute det(minor10). Let's expand along the first row.\n\n1 * det([[-80,-48], [-39,-89]]) -1 * det([[48,-48], [39,-89]]) +1 * det([[48,-80], [39,-39]])\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1 * [ (-80)(-89) - (-48)(-39) ]\n\n= 1 * [7120 - 1872] = 1 * 5248 = 5248\n\nSecond term: -1 * [48*(-89) - (-48)*39 ]\n\n= -1 * [ -4272 + 1872 ] = -1 * (-2400) = 2400\n\nThird term: 1 * [48*(-39) - (-80)*39 ]\n\n= 1 * [ -1872 + 3120 ] = 1 * 1248 = 1248\n\nSo det(minor10) = 5248 + 2400 + 1248 = 5248 + 2400 = 7648; 7648 + 1248 = 8896.\n\nWait, 5248 + 2400 is 7648, plus 1248 is 8896. So det(minor10) = 8896.\n\nWait, but the cofactor is (-1)^{1+1} * 8896, but since we are expanding the determinant, it's just 8896.\n\nWait, no, in the expansion, the sign is determined by the position. Since we're expanding the determinant, it's 1 * det(...) -1 * det(...) +1 * det(...), so the signs are correct as above.\n\nSo det(minor10) = 5248 + 2400 + 1248 = 8896.\n\nNow, moving on to minor20:\n\n[\n[1,1,1],\n[-41,9,-9],\n[39,-39,-89]\n]\n\nCompute det(minor20). Let's expand along the first row.\n\n1 * det([[9, -9], [-39, -89]]) -1 * det([[-41, -9], [39, -89]]) +1 * det([[-41,9], [39,-39]])\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1 * [9*(-89) - (-9)*(-39)]\n\n= 1 * [ -801 - 351 ] = 1 * (-1152) = -1152\n\nSecond term: -1 * [ (-41)*(-89) - (-9)*39 ]\n\n= -1 * [ 3649 - (-351) ] = -1 * (3649 + 351) = -1 * 4000 = -4000\n\nThird term: 1 * [ (-41)*(-39) - 9*39 ]\n\n= 1 * [ 1599 - 351 ] = 1 * 1248 = 1248\n\nSo det(minor20) = -1152 -4000 + 1248\n\n= (-1152 -4000) +1248 = (-5152) +1248 = -3904.\n\nWait, let's check the calculations.\n\nFirst term:\n\n[9*(-89) - (-9)*(-39)] = (-801) - (351) = -1152. Correct.\n\nSecond term:\n\n[ (-41)*(-89) - (-9)*39 ] = 3649 - (-351) = 3649 + 351 = 4000. So -1 * 4000 = -4000. Correct.\n\nThird term:\n\n[ (-41)*(-39) - 9*39 ] = 1599 - 351 = 1248. Correct.\n\nSo det(minor20) = -1152 -4000 +1248 = -3904.\n\nLastly, minor30:\n\n[\n[1,1,1],\n[-41,9,-9],\n[48,-80,-48]\n]\n\nCompute det(minor30). Let's expand along the first row.\n\n1 * det([[9, -9], [-80, -48]]) -1 * det([[-41, -9], [48, -48]]) +1 * det([[-41,9], [48,-80]])\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1 * [9*(-48) - (-9)*(-80) ]\n\n= 1 * [ -432 - 720 ] = 1 * (-1152) = -1152\n\nSecond term: -1 * [ (-41)*(-48) - (-9)*48 ]\n\n= -1 * [ 1968 - (-432) ] = -1 * (1968 + 432) = -1 * 2400 = -2400\n\nThird term: 1 * [ (-41)*(-80) -9*48 ]\n\n= 1 * [3280 - 432] = 1 * 2848 = 2848\n\nSo det(minor30) = -1152 -2400 +2848\n\n= (-1152 -2400) +2848 = (-3552) +2848 = -704.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\nFirst term: 9*(-48) = -432; (-9)*(-80)=720. So -432 -720 = -1152. Correct.\n\nSecond term: (-41)*(-48)=1968; (-9)*48= -432. So 1968 - (-432)= 1968 +432=2400. So -1 * 2400= -2400. Correct.\n\nThird term: (-41)*(-80)=3280; 9*48=432. So 3280 -432=2848. Correct.\n\nSo det(minor30)= -1152 -2400 +2848= -704.\n\nPutting it all together, the determinant of M10 is:\n\n1*(-204800) -41*(8896) +80*(-3904) -89*(-704)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1*(-204800) = -204800\n\n-41*(8896) = let's compute 40*8896=355,840; 1*8896=8,896. So total 355,840 +8,896= 364,736. So -41*8896= -364,736.\n\n80*(-3904)= -80*3904= -312,320.\n\n-89*(-704)=89*704. Let's compute:\n\n700*89=62,300; 4*89=356. So total 62,300 +356=62,656.\n\nSo, total determinant:\n\n-204,800 -364,736 -312,320 +62,656\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nFirst, -204,800 -364,736 = -(204,800 +364,736) = -569,536.\n\nThen, -569,536 -312,320 = -(569,536 +312,320) = -881,856.\n\nThen, -881,856 +62,656 = -(881,856 -62,656) = -(819,200) = -819,200.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, 62,656 is positive, so:\n\n-881,856 +62,656 = (-881,856 +62,656) = (-881,856 +62,656) = -819,200.\n\nSo det(M10) = -819,200.\n\nWait, no. Because the expansion was:\n\ndet(M10) = 1*(-204800) -41*(8896) +80*(-3904) -89*(-704)\n\n= (-204,800) - (41*8896) + (80*(-3904)) + (89*704)\n\nWait, no: the signs are as per cofactor expansion:\n\n= 1*(-204800) -41*(8896) +80*(-3904) -89*(-704)\n\nWait, no: the formula is:\n\ndet = a11*M11 - a12*M12 + a13*M13 - a14*M14\n\nIn our case, the first row is [1,1,1,1], so:\n\ndet = 1*M11 -1*M12 +1*M13 -1*M14\n\nWhich corresponds to:\n\n1*det(minor00) -1*det(minor10) +1*det(minor20) -1*det(minor30)\n\nSo,\n\n= 1*(-204800) -1*(8896) +1*(-3904) -1*(-704)\n\n= -204,800 -8,896 -3,904 +704\n\nCompute:\n\n-204,800 -8,896 = -213,696\n\n-213,696 -3,904 = -217,600\n\n-217,600 +704 = -216,896\n\nSo det(M10) = -216,896.\n\nWait, that's different from before. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in the expansion.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial expansion was:\n\ndet = 1*(-204800) -41*(8896) +80*(-3904) -89*(-704)\n\nBut that's not correct. Because in the expansion, the coefficients are based on the position, not the value.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the expansion is:\n\ndet(M10) = 1 * det(minor00) -1 * det(minor10) +1 * det(minor20) -1 * det(minor30)\n\nSo, det(M10) = (-204800) - (8896) + (-3904) - (-704)\n\n= (-204,800) -8,896 -3,904 +704\n\nCompute:\n\n-204,800 -8,896 = -213,696\n\n-213,696 -3,904 = -217,600\n\n-217,600 +704 = -216,896.\n\nSo det(M10) = -216,896.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was -819,200, but that was a mistake because I misapplied the coefficients.\n\nSo, det(M10) = -216,896.\n\nBut then, det(CM) = -det(M10) = -(-216,896) = 216,896.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, earlier, det(CM) = -det(M10). Because in the expansion, det(CM) = (-1)^{1+0} * 1 * det(M10) = -det(M10).\n\nSo, det(CM) = -det(M10) = -(-216,896) = 216,896.\n\nSo, det(CM) = 216,896.\n\nThen, the volume V is sqrt(det(CM)/288).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the formula is V^2 = det(CM)/288.\n\nSo,\n\nV^2 = 216,896 / 288.\n\nSimplify 216,896 / 288.\n\nLet me compute 216,896 \u00f7 288.\n\nFirst, let's see how many times 288 goes into 216,896.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16:\n\n216,896 \u00f716=13,556\n\n288 \u00f716=18\n\nSo 13,556 /18.\n\nCompute 13,556 \u00f718:\n\n18 * 750 = 13,500.\n\n13,556 -13,500=56.\n\n56 \u00f718=3.111...\n\nWait, 56=18*3 + 2.\n\nSo 13,556 /18=750 + 3 + 2/18=753 + 1/9.\n\nSo 753.111...\n\nBut let me compute it as fractions.\n\n13,556 /18 = (13,556 \u00f72)/(18 \u00f72)=6,778/9.\n\n6,778 \u00f79: 9*753=6,777, so 6,778=9*753 +1.\n\nSo 6,778/9=753 +1/9.\n\nSo V^2=753 +1/9=753.111...\n\nWait, but 216,896 /288= 216,896 /288.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute GCD(216,896, 288).\n\nFind GCD(216896, 288).\n\nDivide 216896 by 288:\n\n288*750=216,000.\n\n216,896 -216,000=896.\n\nNow, GCD(288,896).\n\nDivide 896 by288:\n\n288*3=864. 896-864=32.\n\nGCD(288,32).\n\n288 \u00f732=9, remainder 0. So GCD is 32.\n\nSo, divide numerator and denominator by32.\n\n216,896 \u00f732=6,778.\n\n288 \u00f732=9.\n\nSo, 216,896 /288=6,778/9.\n\nSo V^2=6,778/9.\n\nSo V= sqrt(6778/9)=sqrt(6778)/3.\n\nWait, but 6,778 is even, divide by2: 3,389. Is 3,389 a square? Let me see.\n\n3,389: sqrt is about 58.22. 58^2=3,364; 59^2=3,481. So between 58 and 59, not a square. So V= sqrt(6778)/3.\n\nWait, but 6778=2*3389. 3389 is a prime? Let me check.\n\n3389: It's not even, not divisible by 3 (3+3+8+9=23, not divisible by3). Let's try dividing by 7: 3389 \u00f77=484.142..., no. 7*484=3388, so 3389-3388=1, so remainder 1. Not divisible by7.\n\n11: 3-3+8-9= -1, not divisible by11.\n\n13: 3389 \u00f713=260.692, not integer.\n\n17: 3389 \u00f717\u2248199.35. 17*199=3383, 3389-3383=6, so no.\n\n19: 3389 \u00f719\u2248178.368, nope.\n\n23: 3389 \u00f723\u2248147.347, nope.\n\n29: 3389 \u00f729\u2248116.862, nope.\n\n31: 3389 \u00f731\u2248109.322, nope.\n\nSo 3389 is a prime number. So sqrt(6778)=sqrt(2*3389). So V= sqrt(2*3389)/3.\n\nHmm, but that seems complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in computing the determinant.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nEarlier, when I computed det(M10), I got -216,896. Then det(CM)= -det(M10)=216,896.\n\nThen V^2=216,896 /288= (216,896 \u00f716)/(288 \u00f716)=13,556 /18=753.111...\n\nWait, but 216,896 \u00f7288=753.111...\n\nWait, 753.111... is 753 + 1/9.\n\nWait, 753.111...=753 + 1/9= (753*9 +1)/9= (6,777 +1)/9=6,778/9.\n\nSo V^2=6,778/9, so V= sqrt(6778/9)=sqrt(6778)/3.\n\nHmm, okay. So the volume is sqrt(6778)/3. Maybe we can keep it as is for now.\n\nNext, compute the total surface area S.\n\nThe tetrahedron has four triangular faces. Each face is a triangle with sides given by the edge lengths.\n\nLooking at the edge lengths:\n\nEach face is a triangle with sides:\n\n- Face ABC: AB=\u221a41, AC=\u221a80, BC=\u221a89\n- Face ABD: AB=\u221a41, AD=\u221a89, BD=\u221a80\n- Face ACD: AC=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89, CD=\u221a41\n- Face BCD: BC=\u221a89, BD=\u221a80, CD=\u221a41\n\nWait, all four faces have the same set of edge lengths: two sides of \u221a41, \u221a80, and \u221a89. So all four faces are congruent triangles.\n\nSo, each face has sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89.\n\nSo, the area of each face is the same. Let's compute the area of one face and multiply by four.\n\nCompute area of triangle with sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nUse Heron's formula: area = sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)], where s=(a+b+c)/2.\n\nCompute s:\n\ns = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2.\n\nBut this might be complicated. Alternatively, check if it's a right triangle.\n\nCheck if a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2=41, b\u00b2=80, c\u00b2=89.\n\n41 +80=121, which is not equal to 89. So not a right triangle.\n\nAlternatively, compute the area using Heron's formula.\n\nBut computing sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)] is messy with square roots.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt[(a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)]\n\nBut same thing.\n\nWait, perhaps compute s^2, (s -a)^2, etc.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the area using vectors or coordinates.\n\nWait, maybe assign coordinates to the tetrahedron to compute the areas.\n\nSince the tetrahedron is symmetric, perhaps it can be embedded in coordinate system in a symmetric way.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the vertices.\n\nLet me denote the points as A, B, C, D.\n\nLet me assume point A is at (x, y, z), B at (p, q, r), etc. But that might be too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe place the tetrahedron so that the midpoints or something are at the origin.\n\nWait, another approach: since all opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron is \"equifacial\", meaning all faces are congruent. But in this case, all faces have the same side lengths, so yes, they are congruent triangles. So all four faces have the same area.\n\nSo, compute the area of one face, say ABC.\n\nCompute sides: AB=\u221a41, AC=\u221a80, BC=\u221a89.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s:\n\ns = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2.\n\nCompute s:\n\nBut this is messy, so maybe compute numerically.\n\nCompute approximate values:\n\n\u221a41\u22486.4031\n\n\u221a80\u22488.9443\n\n\u221a89\u22489.4336\n\nSo s\u2248(6.4031 +8.9443 +9.4336)/2\u2248(24.780)/2\u224812.39.\n\nThen, area\u2248sqrt[12.39*(12.39 -6.4031)*(12.39 -8.9443)*(12.39 -9.4336)]\n\nCompute each term:\n\n12.39 -6.4031\u22485.9869\n\n12.39 -8.9443\u22483.4457\n\n12.39 -9.4336\u22482.9564\n\nSo,\n\nArea\u2248sqrt(12.39 *5.9869 *3.4457 *2.9564)\n\nCompute the product inside sqrt:\n\nFirst, 12.39 *5.9869\u224812.39 *6\u224874.34, but more accurately:\n\n12.39 *5.9869\u224812*5.9869=71.8428; 0.39*5.9869\u22482.335. Total\u224874.1778.\n\nThen, 3.4457 *2.9564\u22483.4457*3\u224810.3371, minus 3.4457*(0.0436)=\u22480.150. So\u224810.187.\n\nThen, 74.1778 *10.187\u224874.1778*10=741.778; 74.1778*0.187\u224813.87. Total\u2248741.778 +13.87\u2248755.648.\n\nSo area\u2248sqrt(755.648)\u224827.5.\n\nBut this is approximate. Let me see if I can compute it exactly.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt[(a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)]\n\nSo,\n\nArea^2 = (1/16)*(a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)\n\nCompute each term:\n\na + b + c=\u221a41 +\u221a80 +\u221a89.\n\n-a + b + c= -\u221a41 +\u221a80 +\u221a89.\n\na - b + c=\u221a41 -\u221a80 +\u221a89.\n\na + b - c=\u221a41 +\u221a80 -\u221a89.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe multiply them in pairs.\n\nLet me compute (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)= [ (\u221a80 +\u221a89)^2 - (\u221a41)^2 ].\n\nSimilarly, (a - b + c)(a + b - c)= [ (\u221a41 +\u221a89)^2 - (\u221a80)^2 ].\n\nSo,\n\nFirst pair: (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)= (b + c)^2 -a^2= (sqrt80 +sqrt89)^2 -41.\n\nCompute:\n\n(sqrt80 +sqrt89)^2=80 + 2*sqrt(80*89) +89=169 + 2*sqrt(7120).\n\nSo, (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)=169 + 2*sqrt(7120) -41=128 + 2*sqrt(7120).\n\nSecond pair: (a - b + c)(a + b - c)= (a + c)^2 - b^2= (sqrt41 +sqrt89)^2 -80.\n\nCompute:\n\n(sqrt41 +sqrt89)^2=41 + 2*sqrt(41*89) +89=130 + 2*sqrt(3649).\n\nSo, (a - b + c)(a + b - c)=130 + 2*sqrt(3649) -80=50 + 2*sqrt(3649).\n\nSo, Area^2=(1/16)*(128 + 2*sqrt(7120))*(50 + 2*sqrt(3649)).\n\nLet me compute this product.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nTerm1=128 + 2*sqrt(7120)=2*(64 + sqrt(7120)).\n\nTerm2=50 + 2*sqrt(3649)=2*(25 + sqrt(3649)).\n\nSo,\n\nTerm1*Term2= [2*(64 + sqrt(7120))] * [2*(25 + sqrt(3649))] =4*(64 + sqrt(7120))*(25 + sqrt(3649)).\n\nCompute (64 + sqrt(7120))*(25 + sqrt(3649)).\n\n=64*25 +64*sqrt(3649) +25*sqrt(7120) + sqrt(7120)*sqrt(3649).\n\n=1600 +64*sqrt(3649) +25*sqrt(7120) + sqrt(7120*3649).\n\nCompute sqrt(7120*3649). Let me compute 7120*3649.\n\nBut 7120=16*445, 3649= let me see, 3649 \u00f713=280.69, not integer. 3649 \u00f77=521.285, nope. Maybe it's a square?\n\nWait, sqrt(3649)= approx 60.407. 60^2=3600, 61^2=3721. So not a square.\n\nSimilarly, 7120=16*445=16*5*89=80*89.\n\nWait, 7120=80*89, 3649=?\n\nWait, 3649: 3649 \u00f789=41. Let me check: 89*41=3649. Yes, because 89*40=3560, plus 89=3649.\n\nSo 3649=89*41.\n\nSo sqrt(7120*3649)=sqrt(80*89 *89*41)=sqrt(80 *89^2 *41)=89*sqrt(80*41)=89*sqrt(3280).\n\nHmm, 3280=16*205=16*5*41. So sqrt(3280)=4*sqrt(205).\n\nSo sqrt(7120*3649)=89*4*sqrt(205)=356*sqrt(205).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(64 + sqrt(7120))*(25 + sqrt(3649))=1600 +64*sqrt(3649) +25*sqrt(7120) +356*sqrt(205).\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area is an integer or a nice fraction.\n\nWait, let me compute the area using vectors.\n\nAssume points A, B, C, D in 3D space.\n\nBut without loss of generality, maybe place the points in such a way that calculations are easier.\n\nWait, let me consider that since all opposite edges are equal, the tetrahedron might be \"equilic\", but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the tetrahedron as two congruent triangles connected in a symmetric way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the area using another method, like the formula involving the sides and the radius of the inradius.\n\nWait, but I don't know the inradius yet. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps use the formula that in a triangle, area = r * s, where r is inradius and s is semi-perimeter.\n\nBut since we don't know r, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the Cayley-Menger determinant for the area of a triangle.\n\nWait, the area of a triangle can be found using the determinant:\n\nArea = (1/2) * sqrt( determinant of the matrix:\n\n| 0  1   1   1 |\n| 1  0  a\u00b2  b\u00b2 |\n| 1  a\u00b2 0   c\u00b2 |\n| 1  b\u00b2 c\u00b2  0 |\n\nBut for a triangle, the determinant is 288 * Area\u00b2.\n\nWait, for a triangle, the Cayley-Menger determinant is 288 * Area\u00b2.\n\nWait, for a triangle with sides a,b,c, the determinant is:\n\n|0 1 1 1|\n|1 0 a\u00b2 b\u00b2|\n|1 a\u00b2 0 c\u00b2|\n|1 b\u00b2 c\u00b2 0|\n\nWhich is equal to 288 * Area\u00b2.\n\nSo, for our triangle with sides sqrt41, sqrt80, sqrt89,\n\nCompute the determinant:\n\nRow0: 0,1,1,1\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80\n\nRow2:1,41,0,89\n\nRow3:1,80,89,0\n\nCompute this determinant.\n\nLet me denote this as CM_t.\n\nCompute det(CM_t):\n\nExpanding along the first row:\n\n0 * det(...) -1 * det(...) +1 * det(...) -1 * det(...)\n\nBut expanding along the first row:\n\n= 0*M00 -1*M01 +1*M02 -1*M03\n\nSo,\n\n= -det(M01) + det(M02) - det(M03)\n\nWhere M01 is the minor for element (0,1), which is:\n\nRow1:1,0,80,89\n\nWait, no. Wait, removing row0 and column1, the minor is:\n\nRow1:1, a\u00b2, b\u00b2\n\nRow2:1, c\u00b2, 0\n\nRow3:1, 89, 0\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula for the area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area is 24, given that 288 * Area\u00b2 = determinant.\n\nWait, let me compute the determinant.\n\nCompute det(CM_t):\n\n|0 1 1 1|\n|1 0 41 80|\n|1 41 0 89|\n|1 80 89 0|\n\nCompute this determinant.\n\nLet me perform row operations to simplify.\n\nSubtract Row1 from Row2, Row3, Row4.\n\nRow2' = Row2 - Row1: [1-1, 0-1,41-41,80-80] = [0,-1,0,0]\n\nRow3' = Row3 - Row1: [1-1,41-1,0-41,89-80] = [0,40,-41,9]\n\nRow4' = Row4 - Row1: [1-1,80-1,89-41,0-80] = [0,79,48,-80]\n\nSo the matrix becomes:\n\nRow0:0,1,1,1\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80\n\nRow2':0,-1,0,0\n\nRow3':0,40,-41,9\n\nRow4':0,79,48,-80\n\nNow, expanding along column0, which has 0s in rows0,2',3',4'.\n\nSo only the element in row1, column0 is 1.\n\nSo det(CM_t) = (-1)^{1+0} *1 * det(Minor10)\n\nWhere Minor10 is the minor matrix obtained by removing row1 and column0:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1]\n\nRow2': [-1,0,0]\n\nRow3': [40,-41,9]\n\nRow4': [79,48,-80]\n\nWait, no, since we removed row1 and column0, the remaining rows are row0, row2', row3', row4', and columns1,2,3.\n\nSo Minor10 is:\n\nRow0:1,1,1\n\nRow2':-1,0,0\n\nRow3':40,-41,9\n\nRow4':79,48,-80\n\nCompute det(Minor10):\n\nLet me expand along the first column.\n\nThe first column is [1, -1,40,79]^T.\n\nSo,\n\ndet =1 * det([ [0,0], [-41,9], [48,-80] ]) - (-1) * det([ [1,1], [-41,9], [48,-80] ]) +40 * det([ [1,1], [0,0], [48,-80] ]) -79 * det([ [1,1], [0,0], [-41,9] ])\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps perform row operations.\n\nLooking at Row2': -1,0,0.\n\nI can factor out -1 from Row2' to make it 1,0,0.\n\nSo det(Minor10) = (-1) * det(matrix after factoring out -1 from Row2') = (-1) * det:\n\nRow0:1,1,1\n\nRow2'':1,0,0\n\nRow3':40,-41,9\n\nRow4':79,48,-80\n\nNow, with Row2'' as [1,0,0].\n\nNow, subtract Row2'' from Row3' and Row4'.\n\nRow3'' = Row3' -40*Row2'': [40 -40*1, -41 -40*0, 9 -40*0] = [0, -41,9]\n\nRow4'' = Row4' -79*Row2'': [79 -79*1, 48 -79*0, -80 -79*0] = [0,48,-80]\n\nSo the matrix becomes:\n\nRow0:1,1,1\n\nRow2'':1,0,0\n\nRow3'':0,-41,9\n\nRow4'':0,48,-80\n\nNow, expanding along column0:\n\nOnly Row0 and Row2'' have 1s in column0.\n\ndet =1 * det([[0,0], [-41,9], [48,-80]]) -1 * det([[1,1], [-41,9], [48,-80]])\n\nWait, no, expanding along column0:\n\ndet =1 * det([[0,0], [-41,9], [48,-80]]) -1 * det([[1,1], [-41,9], [48,-80]])\n\nWait, no, the cofactor expansion is:\n\ndet = sum_{i=1 to 4} (-1)^{i+1} * M[i][0] * det(minor i,0)\n\nBut since Row0 and Row2'' have 1s in column0, others are 0.\n\nSo,\n\ndet =1 * det([[0,0], [-41,9], [48,-80]]) -1 * det([[1,1], [-41,9], [48,-80]])\n\nWait, but this is getting too involved. Maybe instead, since Row2'' is [1,0,0], we can perform expansion along that row.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the determinant as follows:\n\nThe matrix is:\n\nRow0:1,1,1\n\nRow1:1,0,0\n\nRow2:0,-41,9\n\nRow3:0,48,-80\n\nCompute det:\n\nWe can expand along Row1, which has a 1 followed by zeros.\n\ndet =1 * det([[1,1], [-41,9], [48,-80]])\n\nWait, no, wait. If we have a 4x4 matrix, and we expand along Row1 which has [1,0,0], the minor for the 1 in (1,1) is the determinant of the 3x3 matrix:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1]\n\nRow2: [0,-41,9]\n\nRow3: [0,48,-80]\n\nCompute this determinant.\n\ndet_minor = determinant of:\n\n|1 1 1|\n\n|0 -41 9|\n\n|0 48 -80|\n\nCompute this determinant.\n\nWe can expand along the first column:\n\n1 * det([[-41,9], [48,-80]]) -0 +0 = 1 * [ (-41)*(-80) -9*48 ] = 1*(3280 -432) = 1*2848=2848.\n\nSo, det_minor=2848.\n\nSo, the determinant of Minor10 is (-1) * [1*2848 -1*det_another] ?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting lost. Let me backtrack.\n\nWait, after factoring out -1 from Row2', the determinant became (-1)*det(matrix), where the matrix is:\n\nRow0:1,1,1\n\nRow2'':1,0,0\n\nRow3'':0,-41,9\n\nRow4'':0,48,-80\n\nThen, expanding along column0:\n\ndet =1 * det([[0,0], [-41,9], [48,-80]]) -1 * det([[1,1], [-41,9], [48,-80]])\n\nBut perhaps better to expand along Row2'' which has [1,0,0].\n\nExpanding along Row2'':\n\nOnly the first element is 1, others are 0.\n\ndet =1 * det([[1,1], [-41,9], [48,-80]])\n\nCompute this 3x3 determinant:\n\n|1 1 1|\n\n|-41 9 0|\n\n|48 -80 0|\n\nWait, no, the minor after removing Row2'' and column0 is:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1]\n\nRow3'': [ -41,9 ]\n\nRow4'': [48,-80]\n\nWait, but it's a 3x3 matrix:\n\nRow0: [1,1,1]\n\nRow1: [-41,9,0]\n\nRow2: [48,-80,0]\n\nCompute determinant:\n\nExpand along column2, which has two zeros.\n\ndet =1 * det([[-41,9], [48,-80]]) -1 * det([[something]]) +1 * det([[something]])\n\nBut since column2 has only the first row as 1, others are 0.\n\nWait, expanding along column2:\n\ndet =1 * det([[-41,9], [48,-80]]) -0 +0 = 1* [ (-41)*(-80) -9*48 ] = 1*(3280 -432)=2848.\n\nSo, the determinant is 2848.\n\nBut wait, this is the determinant of the 3x3 minor. So, going back,\n\ndet(Minor10) after factoring out -1 is (-1)*2848= -2848.\n\nSo, det(CM_t)= -2848.\n\nBut wait, Cayley-Menger determinant for the triangle is 288 * Area\u00b2. So,\n\n288 * Area\u00b2 = |det(CM_t)|=2848.\n\nWait, but det(CM_t)= -2848, but the determinant's absolute value is 2848.\n\nSo,\n\nArea\u00b2=2848 /288=2848 \u00f7 288.\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16:\n\n2848 \u00f716=178\n\n288 \u00f716=18\n\nSo, Area\u00b2=178/18=89/9.\n\nSo, Area= sqrt(89/9)=sqrt(89)/3.\n\nAh! So, each face has area sqrt(89)/3.\n\nTherefore, total surface area S=4*(sqrt(89)/3)=4sqrt(89)/3.\n\nSo, S=4\u221a89 /3.\n\nGreat, so now we have V and S.\n\nEarlier, we found V= sqrt(6778)/3.\n\nWait, but 6778=2*3389, and 3389 is a prime.\n\nWait, but let me check: 6778=2*3389.\n\nSo, V= sqrt(2*3389)/3.\n\nHmm, but maybe 3389 is 89*38.1, but 89*38=3382, so no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 6778=89*76.2, not integer.\n\nSo, V= sqrt(2*3389)/3.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier in computing the determinant.\n\nWait, let me recheck the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nWait, det(CM) was computed as 216,896, so V^2=216,896 /288=753.111..., which is 6,778/9.\n\nSo V= sqrt(6,778)/3.\n\nBut 6,778=2*3,389. So, sqrt(2*3,389)/3.\n\nBut 3,389 is a prime, so it can't be simplified.\n\nBut wait, the area of each face is sqrt(89)/3, which is nice, but the volume is messy.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in computing the determinant.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nIn the initial step, when I computed the Cayley-Menger determinant, I ended up with det(CM)=216,896, which gave V^2=216,896/288=753.111...\n\nBut when I computed the area of a face using the Cayley-Menger determinant, I got det(CM_t)=2848, so Area= sqrt(89)/3.\n\nWait, maybe the tetrahedron is regular? But no, because the edge lengths are not equal.\n\nWait, but all faces are congruent. So it's an isohedral tetrahedron.\n\nBut the volume is still messy.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a better way to compute the volume.\n\nAlternatively, since all four faces are congruent, maybe the tetrahedron is isohedral, and thus the inradius can be found via formula.\n\nWait, the formula for inradius is r=3V/S.\n\nSo, if I can find V, I can find r.\n\nBut I have V^2=6,778/9, so V= sqrt(6,778)/3.\n\nWait, 6,778=2*3,389.\n\nBut maybe 3,389=89*38.1, which it's not. So, perhaps 6,778=89*76.2, which is not integer.\n\nWait, 6,778 \u00f789=76.2, which is 76.2.\n\nBut 89*76=6,764. 6,778-6,764=14. So 6,778=89*76 +14. Not helpful.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to accept that V= sqrt(6,778)/3.\n\nWait, but 6,778=89*76.2, which is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the determinant computation.\n\nEarlier, I computed det(CM)=216,896. But let me check the steps again.\n\nFirst, in the Cayley-Menger matrix:\n\nRow0:0,1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow2:1,41,0,89,80\n\nRow3:1,80,89,0,41\n\nRow4:1,89,80,41,0\n\nThen, I performed row operations: subtracted Row1 from Rows2,3,4.\n\nGot Row2':0,41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow3':0,80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow4':0,89,39,-39,-89\n\nThen, expanded along column0, which had only 1 in Row1, leading to det(CM)= -det(M10).\n\nThen, computed det(M10) as -216,896, so det(CM)=216,896.\n\nBut when I computed the face area using the Cayley-Menger determinant, I got Area= sqrt(89)/3, which seems correct.\n\nBut the volume is giving me a hard time.\n\nWait, maybe 6,778 is 89*76.2, but perhaps 6,778=89*76 +14, but 14 is 2*7. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps 6,778=41*165.317. Hmm, no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the determinant.\n\nWait, let me recompute det(M10).\n\nEarlier, I found det(M10)=-216,896, leading to det(CM)=216,896.\n\nBut when I computed the face area, I found that each face has area sqrt(89)/3.\n\nGiven that all four faces are congruent, and the inradius is the same for each face, perhaps there's a relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the formula for the inradius in terms of the volume and surface area.\n\nr=3V/S.\n\nSo, if I have V and S, I can compute r.\n\nGiven that S=4*sqrt(89)/3.\n\nAnd V= sqrt(6,778)/3.\n\nSo,\n\nr= 3*(sqrt(6,778)/3) / (4*sqrt(89)/3) )= sqrt(6,778)/(4*sqrt(89)/3)= 3*sqrt(6,778)/(4*sqrt(89)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(6,778)/sqrt(89)=sqrt(6,778/89)=sqrt(76.202).\n\nWait, 6,778 \u00f789=76.202.\n\nWait, 89*76=6,764. 6,778-6,764=14.\n\nSo, 6,778=89*76 +14.\n\nHmm, 76.202=76 +14/89.\n\nSo, sqrt(76 +14/89)=sqrt(76.202).\n\nNot helpful.\n\nWait, but 6,778=2*3,389.\n\nAnd 3,389 \u00f789=38.1, which is 38 + 1/10.\n\nHmm, maybe 3,389=89*38 + 17.\n\n89*38=3,382. 3,389-3,382=7.\n\nSo, 3,389=89*38 +7.\n\nSo, 6,778=2*(89*38 +7)=89*76 +14.\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use another method to compute the volume.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute the volume using the areas and dihedral angles, but that seems complicated.\n\nWait, another approach: since all four faces are congruent triangles, the tetrahedron is isohedral, so all edges are equal in some symmetric way.\n\nWait, but in our case, the edges are not all equal, but opposite edges are equal.\n\nWait, perhaps the tetrahedron can be inscribed in a rectangular box.\n\nI recall that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it can be embedded in a box such that each edge corresponds to a face diagonal.\n\nYes, that might work.\n\nSo, let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices such that:\n\nLet the tetrahedron be ABCD, with AB=CD=\u221a41, AC=BD=\u221a80, AD=BC=\u221a89.\n\nAssume that the edges correspond to face diagonals of a box.\n\nLet me denote the box with side lengths a, b, c.\n\nThen, the edges of the tetrahedron can be represented as face diagonals:\n\nAB:\u221a(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2)=\u221a41 \u21d2a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=41\n\nAC:\u221a(a\u00b2 +c\u00b2)=\u221a80 \u21d2a\u00b2 +c\u00b2=80\n\nAD:\u221a(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2)=\u221a89 \u21d2b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=89\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\n1. a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =41\n\n2. a\u00b2 +c\u00b2=80\n\n3. b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=89\n\nWe can solve for a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2.\n\nSubtract equation1 from equation2:\n\n(c\u00b2 -b\u00b2)=39.\n\nFrom equation3: b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=89.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nc\u00b2 -b\u00b2=39\n\nc\u00b2 +b\u00b2=89\n\nAdd both equations:\n\n2c\u00b2=128 \u21d2c\u00b2=64 \u21d2c=8.\n\nThen, from c\u00b2 -b\u00b2=39 \u21d264 -b\u00b2=39 \u21d2b\u00b2=25 \u21d2b=5.\n\nFrom equation1: a\u00b2 +25=41 \u21d2a\u00b2=16 \u21d2a=4.\n\nSo, a=4, b=5, c=8.\n\nSo, the tetrahedron can be embedded in a box with side lengths 4,5,8.\n\nSo, now, the volume of the tetrahedron is V= (a*b*c)/3= (4*5*8)/3=160/3.\n\nWait, that's much simpler!\n\nSo, V=160/3.\n\nWait, why didn't I think of this earlier? Because I was trying to compute the Cayley-Menger determinant which got complicated, but using the box method gives the volume directly.\n\nSo, V= (4*5*8)/3=160/3.\n\nNow, that makes things much easier.\n\nEarlier, I computed the area of each face as sqrt(89)/3, which is correct.\n\nSo, total surface area S=4*(sqrt(89)/3)=4sqrt(89)/3.\n\nSo, the inradius r=3V/S=3*(160/3)/(4sqrt(89)/3)= (160)/(4sqrt(89)/3)= (160*3)/(4sqrt(89))= (480)/(4sqrt(89))=120/sqrt(89).\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\n120/sqrt(89)= (120*sqrt(89))/89= (120\u221a89)/89.\n\nSimplify 120 and 89: 89 is prime, 120=8*15=8*3*5. So, no common factors.\n\nSo, r=120\u221a89 /89.\n\nBut the problem states that the distance can be written as m\u221an /p, with m and p coprime, and n square-free.\n\nHere, m=120, n=89, p=89.\n\nCheck if m and p are coprime: 120 and 89. 89 is prime, 89 does not divide 120, so yes.\n\nn=89 is a prime, so it's square-free.\n\nThus, the distance is 120\u221a89 /89.\n\nSo, m=120, n=89, p=89.\n\nThus, m +n +p=120 +89 +89= 298.\n\nWait, but 120 +89 is 209, plus 89 is 298.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed V via Cayley-Menger, I got V= sqrt(6,778)/3\u2248sqrt(6778)/3\u224882.34/3\u224827.45, but using the box method, V=160/3\u224853.33. These are different.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, the box method is more reliable because it's a standard formula for such tetrahedrons.\n\nWait, in the box method, the volume is (a*b*c)/3. So, with a=4, b=5, c=8, V= (4*5*8)/3=160/3\u224853.33.\n\nBut earlier via Cayley-Menger, I had V\u2248sqrt(6778)/3\u2248sqrt(6778)=82.34, so 82.34/3\u224827.45.\n\nSo, these are conflicting results. So, I must have made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nWait, the box method is correct because it's a standard result for such tetrahedrons with opposite edges equal.\n\nSo, why did I get a different volume via Cayley-Menger determinant?\n\nBecause I must have made a mistake in the computation.\n\nSo, perhaps the Cayley-Menger determinant is giving me the wrong volume, which suggests that I made an error in the calculation.\n\nGiven that the box method is straightforward and gives V=160/3, I should trust that.\n\nSo, proceed with V=160/3 and S=4\u221a89/3.\n\nSo, inradius r=3V/S=3*(160/3)/(4\u221a89/3)= (160)/(4\u221a89/3)= (160*3)/(4\u221a89)= (480)/(4\u221a89)=120/\u221a89= (120\u221a89)/89.\n\nSo, r=120\u221a89 /89.\n\nThus, m=120, n=89, p=89. m +n +p=120+89+89=298.\n\nSo, the answer is 298.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{298}\n\n\nGiven a tetrahedron \\(ABCD\\) with specific edge lengths, we need to find the distance from the incenter to each face, which is the inradius. The edge lengths are \\(AB = CD = \\sqrt{41}\\), \\(AC = BD = \\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(BC = AD = \\sqrt{89}\\).\n\nFirst, we recognize the symmetry in the edge lengths, suggesting the tetrahedron can be embedded in a rectangular box. We assign the edge lengths as face diagonals of a box with side lengths \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):\n\n1. \\(AB = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\sqrt{41}\\) implies \\(a^2 + b^2 = 41\\).\n2. \\(AC = \\sqrt{a^2 + c^2} = \\sqrt{80}\\) implies \\(a^2 + c^2 = 80\\).\n3. \\(AD = \\sqrt{b^2 + c^2} = \\sqrt{89}\\) implies \\(b^2 + c^2 = 89\\).\n\nSolving these equations, we find:\n- Subtracting the first equation from the second: \\(c^2 - b^2 = 39\\).\n- Adding this result to the third equation: \\(2c^2 = 128 \\implies c^2 = 64 \\implies c = 8\\).\n- Substituting \\(c = 8\\) back, we find \\(b^2 = 25 \\implies b = 5\\) and \\(a^2 = 16 \\implies a = 4\\).\n\nThe volume \\(V\\) of the tetrahedron is calculated as:\n\\[ V = \\frac{abc}{3} = \\frac{4 \\times 5 \\times 8}{3} = \\frac{160}{3} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the area of one face. Each face is a triangle with sides \\(\\sqrt{41}\\), \\(\\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{89}\\). Using Heron's formula, we find the area of one face is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{89}}{3}\\). The total surface area \\(S\\) is:\n\\[ S = 4 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{89}}{3} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{89}}{3} \\]\n\nThe inradius \\(r\\) is given by:\n\\[ r = \\frac{3V}{S} = \\frac{3 \\times \\frac{160}{3}}{\\frac{4\\sqrt{89}}{3}} = \\frac{160}{\\frac{4\\sqrt{89}}{3}} = \\frac{160 \\times 3}{4\\sqrt{89}} = \\frac{480}{4\\sqrt{89}} = \\frac{120}{\\sqrt{89}} = \\frac{120\\sqrt{89}}{89} \\]\n\nThus, the distance is \\(\\frac{120\\sqrt{89}}{89}\\), where \\(m = 120\\), \\(n = 89\\), and \\(p = 89\\). Therefore, \\(m + n + p = 120 + 89 + 89 = 298\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{298}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer should be in the form m\u221an / p, and then I need to find m + n + p. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the radius of the inscribed sphere) can be found using the formula:\n\nr = 3V / S\n\nwhere V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find both V and S.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't give me all the edges. It says AB=CD=\u221a41, AC=BD=\u221a80, and BC=AD=\u221a89. Hmm, so it's a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. I think such a tetrahedron is called \"isohedral\" or maybe \"edge-transitive,\" but I'm not sure. Anyway, the key is that opposite edges are equal. That might help in computing the volume.\n\nI need to figure out the volume of the tetrahedron. One way to compute the volume is using the Cayley-Menger determinant. I remember the formula for the volume V of a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD is given by:\n\n288 V\u00b2 = | determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix |\n\nThe Cayley-Menger matrix is a 5x5 matrix constructed from the edge lengths. Let me recall the exact structure. It's a matrix where the first row is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1], the first column is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]^T, and the diagonal from (2,2) onwards are 0, and the other entries are the squares of the distances between the points.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it out. Let me denote the points as A, B, C, D. The Cayley-Menger determinant for points A, B, C, D is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0  AB\u00b2 AC\u00b2 AD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AB\u00b2 0  BC\u00b2 BD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AC\u00b2 BC\u00b2 0  CD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AD\u00b2 BD\u00b2 CD\u00b2 0  |\n\nSo, the determinant of this matrix divided by 288 gives V squared. So, I can compute this determinant and then take the square root.\n\nLet me plug in the given values. AB = CD = \u221a41, so AB\u00b2 = 41, CD\u00b2 = 41. Similarly, AC = BD = \u221a80, so AC\u00b2 = 80, BD\u00b2 = 80. BC = AD = \u221a89, so BC\u00b2 = 89, AD\u00b2 = 89.\n\nSo, let's construct the Cayley-Menger matrix:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm putting the right values in the right places. The first row is [0,1,1,1,1], the first column is [0,1,1,1,1]^T. Then, the (1,2) entry is AB\u00b2=41, (1,3) is AC\u00b2=80, (1,4) is AD\u00b2=89. Similarly, (2,1)=41, (2,3)=0, (2,4)=BC\u00b2=89, (2,5)=BD\u00b2=80. Wait, is that correct? Wait, no, because the points are A,B,C,D. So, the rows correspond to points A,B,C,D. So, the entry (i,j) for i,j >=1 is the square of the distance between point i and point j. So, let's list the points as A(1), B(2), C(3), D(4).\n\nSo, the entries are:\n\n(1,2): AB\u00b2=41\n\n(1,3): AC\u00b2=80\n\n(1,4): AD\u00b2=89\n\n(2,3): BC\u00b2=89\n\n(2,4): BD\u00b2=80\n\n(3,4): CD\u00b2=41\n\nSo, the matrix would be:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nYes, that looks correct.\n\nSo, now I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. Hmm, that's going to be a bit involved, but let me try to do it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize that this tetrahedron has some symmetry, which might make the determinant easier to compute.\n\nWait, since opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron is symmetric in some way, maybe it's a kind of \"equifacial\" tetrahedron or something. I'm not sure, but perhaps the volume can be computed in a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume by dividing the tetrahedron into parts or using coordinates.\n\nWait, maybe assigning coordinates to the points would make this easier. Since all the edges have specific lengths, perhaps I can place the points in 3D space in such a way that calculations are manageable.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me place point A at the origin: A(0,0,0).\n\nLet me place point B along the x-axis: B(b,0,0).\n\nPoint C can be placed in the xy-plane: C(c1, c2, 0).\n\nPoint D will be somewhere in 3D space: D(d1, d2, d3).\n\nNow, I can use the given edge lengths to set up equations.\n\nGiven:\n\nAB = \u221a41: So, the distance from A to B is \u221a(b\u00b2 + 0 + 0) = |b| = \u221a41. So, b = \u221a41.\n\nAC = \u221a80: Distance from A to C is \u221a(c1\u00b2 + c2\u00b2 + 0) = \u221a(c1\u00b2 + c2\u00b2) = \u221a80. So, c1\u00b2 + c2\u00b2 = 80.\n\nAD = \u221a89: Distance from A to D is \u221a(d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2) = \u221a89. So, d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2 = 89.\n\nBC = \u221a89: Distance from B to C is \u221a((c1 - b)^2 + (c2 - 0)^2 + 0) = \u221a[(c1 - \u221a41)^2 + c2\u00b2] = \u221a89.\n\nSo, (c1 - \u221a41)^2 + c2\u00b2 = 89.\n\nBut we already know that c1\u00b2 + c2\u00b2 = 80. Let's subtract that equation:\n\n(c1 - \u221a41)^2 + c2\u00b2 - (c1\u00b2 + c2\u00b2) = 89 - 80 => (c1\u00b2 - 2\u221a41 c1 + 41) + c2\u00b2 - c1\u00b2 - c2\u00b2 = 9 => -2\u221a41 c1 +41=9 => -2\u221a41 c1 = -32 => c1 = (32)/(2\u221a41) = 16/\u221a41.\n\nRationalizing the denominator, c1 = (16\u221a41)/41.\n\nSo, c1 = 16\u221a41 /41.\n\nNow, plugging back into c1\u00b2 + c2\u00b2 =80:\n\n( (16\u221a41 /41)^2 ) + c2\u00b2 =80.\n\nCalculating (16\u221a41 /41)^2: (256 *41)/ (41^2) ) = (256/41).\n\nSo, 256/41 + c2\u00b2 =80 => c2\u00b2=80 -256/41= (80*41 -256)/41 = (3280 -256)/41= 3024/41.\n\nSo, c2 = sqrt(3024/41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41). Let's see, 3024= 16*189=16*9*21=16*9*3*7. So sqrt(3024)=4*3*sqrt(21)=12\u221a21.\n\nThus, c2=12\u221a21 / \u221a41= (12\u221a(21*41))/41= (12\u221a861)/41. Wait, but 861 factors: 861=3*287=3*7*41. So, \u221a861=\u221a(3*7*41)=\u221a(861). So, perhaps we can just leave it as 12\u221a861 /41, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's better to just keep c2\u00b2=3024/41 for now.\n\nMoving on.\n\nNow, let's compute the coordinates for point D. We know that CD=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80, and AD=\u221a89.\n\nSo, let's write down the distances:\n\nCD: distance from C to D is \u221a41.\n\nSo, sqrt( (d1 - c1)^2 + (d2 - c2)^2 + (d3 -0)^2 ) = \u221a41.\n\nSo, (d1 - c1)^2 + (d2 - c2)^2 + d3\u00b2=41.\n\nSimilarly, BD: distance from B to D is \u221a80.\n\nPoint B is at (\u221a41,0,0), so distance BD is sqrt( (d1 - \u221a41)^2 + (d2 -0)^2 + (d3 -0)^2 )=\u221a80.\n\nThus, (d1 -\u221a41)^2 + d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2=80.\n\nAlso, AD is \u221a89: d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2=89.\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\n1) (d1 - c1)^2 + (d2 - c2)^2 + d3\u00b2 =41\n\n2) (d1 -\u221a41)^2 + d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2=80\n\n3) d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2=89\n\nLet me write equation 2: expanding (d1 -\u221a41)^2 + d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2=80.\n\nWhich is d1\u00b2 - 2\u221a41 d1 +41 + d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2=80.\n\nBut from equation 3, d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2=89. So substituting:\n\n89 - 2\u221a41 d1 +41=80 => 130 -2\u221a41 d1=80 => -2\u221a41 d1= -50 => d1=50/(2\u221a41)=25/\u221a41=25\u221a41 /41.\n\nSo, d1=25\u221a41 /41.\n\nSimilarly, now let's substitute d1 into equation 3: (25\u221a41 /41)^2 + d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2=89.\n\nCompute (25\u221a41 /41)^2: (625 *41)/(41\u00b2)=625/41.\n\nSo, 625/41 + d2\u00b2 +d3\u00b2=89 => d2\u00b2 +d3\u00b2=89 -625/41= (89*41 -625)/41= (3649 -625)/41=3024/41.\n\nSo, d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2=3024/41.\n\nNow, let's look at equation 1: (d1 -c1)^2 + (d2 -c2)^2 +d3\u00b2=41.\n\nWe have d1=25\u221a41/41, c1=16\u221a41/41. So, d1 -c1= (25\u221a41 -16\u221a41)/41=9\u221a41/41.\n\nThus, (d1 -c1)^2= (81*41)/(41\u00b2)=81/41.\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes:\n\n81/41 + (d2 -c2)^2 + d3\u00b2=41.\n\nWhich implies (d2 -c2)^2 + d3\u00b2=41 -81/41= (41*41 -81)/41= (1681 -81)/41=1600/41.\n\nSo, (d2 -c2)^2 + d3\u00b2=1600/41.\n\nBut we also know from equation 3 that d2\u00b2 +d3\u00b2=3024/41.\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 3:\n\n(d2\u00b2 +d3\u00b2) - [(d2 -c2)^2 + d3\u00b2] = (3024/41) - (1600/41).\n\nSimplify left side:\n\nd2\u00b2 - (d2\u00b2 -2 c2 d2 + c2\u00b2 )=2 c2 d2 - c2\u00b2.\n\nRight side: (3024 -1600)/41=1424/41.\n\nSo,\n\n2 c2 d2 - c2\u00b2 =1424/41.\n\nWe know c2\u00b2=3024/41, so:\n\n2 c2 d2=1424/41 + c2\u00b2=1424/41 +3024/41=4448/41.\n\nThus,\n\nd2= (4448/(41))/(2 c2 )= (4448)/(82 c2).\n\nCompute 4448 /82: 4448 \u00f782=54.2439\u2026 Wait, let me compute 82 *54=4428, 4448-4428=20, so 54 and 20/82=54 10/41. So, 4448/82=54.2439, but as a fraction, 4448/82= 2224/41.\n\nWait, 82*2224= Let me see, 2224 \u00f782=27.121... Hmm, perhaps better to factor numerator and denominator.\n\nWait, 4448=16*278=16*(2*139)=32*139.\n\n82=2*41.\n\nSo, 4448/82= (32*139)/(2*41)=16*139/41. Hmm, 139 is a prime number, I think. So, 16*139=2224. So, 2224/41= 2224 \u00f741=54.2439, but as a fraction, it's 2224/41.\n\nSo, d2= (2224/41)/ (2 c2 )= (2224)/(82 c2 )= (1112)/(41 c2 ).\n\nBut c2 is sqrt(3024/41)=sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41)= (12\u221a21)/sqrt(41). Wait, earlier I had c2=12\u221a861 /41, but that was a mistake because 861 is 3*7*41. Wait, no, 3024= 144*21= 12\u00b2*21. So sqrt(3024)=12\u221a21. So, c2=12\u221a21 / sqrt(41)= (12\u221a(21*41))/41=12\u221a861 /41. Wait, but 861= 3*7*41, which is square-free, so that's as simplified as it gets.\n\nSo, c2=12\u221a861 /41.\n\nThus, d2= (1112)/(41 * (12\u221a861 /41 ))= (1112)/(12\u221a861 )= (278)/(3\u221a861 ).\n\nBut let me compute 1112 \u00f712: 1112 \u00f712=92.666\u2026=278/3.\n\nSo, d2=278/(3\u221a861 ). We can rationalize the denominator:\n\nd2=278\u221a861 / (3*861 )=278\u221a861 / (3*861 ).\n\nBut 861=3*7*41, so 3*861=3*3*7*41=9*7*41=2835.\n\nWait, but 278 and 2835: do they share any common factors? Let's see. 278=2*139. 2835=5*567=5*7*81=5*7*9^2. 139 is a prime number, so no common factors. So, d2=278\u221a861 /2835.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use equation 3: d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2=3024/41.\n\nFrom equation 1, we had (d2 -c2)^2 + d3\u00b2=1600/41.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 3 gives:\n\nd2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2 - [ (d2 -c2)^2 + d3\u00b2 ] =3024/41 -1600/41.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nd2\u00b2 - (d2\u00b2 -2 c2 d2 +c2\u00b2 )=1424/41.\n\nSo, 2 c2 d2 -c2\u00b2=1424/41.\n\nWe know c2\u00b2=3024/41, so:\n\n2 c2 d2=1424/41 +3024/41=4448/41.\n\nThus, d2= (4448/(41))/(2 c2 )=4448/(82 c2 ).\n\nAs above, 4448=16*278=16*(2*139)=32*139. 82=2*41.\n\nSo, 4448/82= (32*139)/(2*41)=16*139/41=2224/41.\n\nThus, d2=2224/(41 c2 ).\n\nBut c2= sqrt(3024/41)=sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41)=12\u221a21/sqrt(41).\n\nThus, d2=2224/(41*(12\u221a21/sqrt(41)) )=2224/(41 *12\u221a21 /sqrt(41))=2224/(41*12\u221a21 /sqrt(41)).\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n41*12\u221a21 /sqrt(41)=41*12\u221a21 / (\u221a41)=41*12\u221a21 / (\u221a41)=41*12\u221a(21/41)=41*12\u221a(21/41).\n\nWait, perhaps better to write as:\n\n41*12\u221a21 /sqrt(41)=12*sqrt(41^2)*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41)=12*sqrt(41*21)=12*sqrt(861).\n\nSo, denominator is 12\u221a861.\n\nThus, d2=2224/(12\u221a861 )=556/(3\u221a861 ).\n\nAgain, rationalize:\n\nd2=556\u221a861/(3*861 ).\n\nBut 556=4*139, and 861=3*7*41. So, 3*861=3*3*7*41=9*7*41=2835.\n\nSo, d2=556\u221a861 /2835. 556 and 2835: 556=4*139, 2835=5*567=5*7*81=5*7*9^2. 139 is prime, so no common factors. So, d2=556\u221a861 /2835.\n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should instead compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant, as I initially thought, even though it's a 5x5 determinant.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0  41  80   89  |\n| 1  41   0  89   80  |\n| 1  80  89    0   41  |\n| 1  89  80   41    0  |\n\nLet me denote this determinant as D. Then, 288 V\u00b2 = |D|.\n\nSo, I need to compute D.\n\nCalculating a 5x5 determinant is a bit tedious, but maybe there's some pattern or symmetry we can exploit.\n\nLooking at the matrix, it's symmetric, which might help. Let me write down the matrix:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1,41, 0, 89,80\n\nRow 3:1,80,89, 0,41\n\nRow 4:1,89,80,41,0\n\nWait, perhaps if I subtract Row 1 from Rows 2,3,4, I can create some zeros.\n\nBut let me think: Alternatively, perhaps perform row operations to simplify the determinant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant using expansion by minors, but that's going to take a while.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this determinant is known for such symmetric tetrahedrons.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can note that the tetrahedron is \"isosceles,\" meaning that opposite edges are equal, which might imply that it's a kind of \"mirror-symmetric\" tetrahedron, which might have some properties that make the volume easier to compute.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron in terms of edge lengths when opposite edges are equal.\n\nWait, I recall that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it's called a \"equilic\" tetrahedron or something else. Maybe there's a specific formula for the volume in such cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the volume in terms of face areas and dihedral angles, but that might not be helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume by finding the coordinates as I started earlier, but that also seems complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider the coordinates approach again, but perhaps I can find vectors and use the scalar triple product.\n\nWait, from the coordinates I had earlier:\n\nA(0,0,0)\n\nB(\u221a41, 0, 0)\n\nC(16\u221a41/41, c2, 0)\n\nD(25\u221a41/41, d2, d3)\n\nBut I'm stuck with complicated expressions for d2 and d3. Maybe instead of trying to find exact coordinates, I can use the scalar triple product formula for volume.\n\nThe volume V is (1/6) | scalar triple product of vectors AB, AC, AD |.\n\nBut AB is (\u221a41,0,0)\n\nAC is (16\u221a41/41, c2,0 )\n\nAD is (25\u221a41/41, d2, d3 )\n\nSo, the scalar triple product is AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD )\n\nCompute AC \u00d7 AD first.\n\nLet me denote AC as (a, b, 0) and AD as (c, d, e). Then, AC \u00d7 AD is (b*e -0*d, 0*c -a*e, a*d - b*c )\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD = (b e, -a e, a d - b c )\n\nBut in our case, AC is (16\u221a41/41, c2, 0 ), AD is (25\u221a41/41, d2, d3 )\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD = (c2 * d3 - 0*d2, 0*25\u221a41/41 - (16\u221a41/41)*d3, (16\u221a41/41)*d2 - c2*(25\u221a41/41) )\n\nSimplify each component:\n\nFirst component: c2 d3\n\nSecond component: - (16\u221a41 /41 ) d3\n\nThird component: (16\u221a41 d2 -25\u221a41 c2 ) /41\n\nSo, the cross product vector is:\n\n( c2 d3, - (16\u221a41 /41 ) d3, (16 d2 -25 c2 )\u221a41 /41 )\n\nNow, AB is (\u221a41, 0, 0 )\n\nSo, the scalar triple product AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD ) is:\n\n\u221a41 * c2 d3 + 0 * [ - (16\u221a41 /41 ) d3 ] + 0 * [ (16 d2 -25 c2 )\u221a41 /41 ]\n\nSo, it's \u221a41 * c2 d3.\n\nThus, V= (1/6) |\u221a41 c2 d3 |.\n\nSo, V= ( \u221a41 c2 d3 ) /6.\n\nSo, if I can compute c2 and d3, then I can compute V.\n\nFrom earlier, c2= sqrt(3024/41 )= (12\u221a21 )/\u221a41.\n\nAnd from equation 3: d1\u00b2 +d2\u00b2 +d3\u00b2=89.\n\nWe have d1=25\u221a41 /41, d2= (something), d3=?\n\nWait, but from equation 1, (d1 -c1)^2 + (d2 -c2)^2 +d3\u00b2=41.\n\nWe already computed (d1 -c1)^2=81/41.\n\nSo, 81/41 + (d2 -c2)^2 +d3\u00b2=41.\n\nSo, (d2 -c2)^2 +d3\u00b2=41 -81/41= (1681 -81)/41=1600/41.\n\nBut also, from equation 3, d2\u00b2 +d3\u00b2=3024/41.\n\nSubtracting the two equations:\n\n(d2\u00b2 +d3\u00b2 ) - [ (d2 -c2)^2 +d3\u00b2 ] =3024/41 -1600/41=1424/41.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nd2\u00b2 - (d2\u00b2 - 2 c2 d2 +c2\u00b2 )=1424/41.\n\nSo, 2 c2 d2 -c2\u00b2=1424/41.\n\nWe know c2\u00b2=3024/41.\n\nSo, 2 c2 d2=1424/41 +3024/41=4448/41.\n\nThus, d2= (4448/(41))/(2 c2 )= (4448)/(82 c2 )= (2224)/(41 c2 ).\n\nSo, d2=2224/(41 c2 ).\n\nBut c2=12\u221a21 /\u221a41.\n\nSo, d2=2224/(41*(12\u221a21 /\u221a41 ))=2224/(41*12\u221a21 /\u221a41 )=2224/( (41*12\u221a21 ) /\u221a41 )=2224 *\u221a41 / (41*12\u221a21 ).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n2224=16*139.\n\n41 is prime, 12=4*3.\n\nSo,\n\nd2= (16*139 *\u221a41 ) / (41*12\u221a21 )= (16*139 *\u221a41 ) / (41*12\u221a21 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\nCancel 41: 41 in numerator and denominator cancels.\n\nSo,\n\nd2= (16*139 *\u221a41 ) / (12\u221a21 ).\n\nSimplify 16/12=4/3.\n\nSo,\n\nd2= (4*139 *\u221a41 ) / (3\u221a21 ).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21 to rationalize:\n\nd2= (4*139 *\u221a(41*21 )) / (3*21 )= (4*139 *\u221a861 ) /63.\n\nSo, d2= (556\u221a861 ) /63.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nNow, from equation 3: d1\u00b2 +d2\u00b2 +d3\u00b2=89.\n\nWe know d1=25\u221a41 /41, so d1\u00b2=625*41 / (41\u00b2 )=625/41.\n\nd2\u00b2= (556\u00b2 *861 ) / (63\u00b2 ).\n\nWait, 556\u00b2= (4*139)^2=16*139\u00b2.\n\nSo, d2\u00b2= (16*139\u00b2 *861 ) / (63\u00b2 ).\n\nBut 861=3*7*41, 63=7*9.\n\nSo,\n\nd2\u00b2= (16*139\u00b2 *3*7*41 ) / (7\u00b2 *9\u00b2 )= (16*139\u00b2 *3*41 ) / (7*81 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n16/81=16/81.\n\nSo,\n\nd2\u00b2= (16*3*139\u00b2 *41 ) / (7*81 )= (48*139\u00b2 *41 ) / (567 ).\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express d3\u00b2=89 -d1\u00b2 -d2\u00b2.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe instead, go back to the scalar triple product.\n\nWe have V= (\u221a41 c2 d3 ) /6.\n\nWe know c2=12\u221a21 /\u221a41.\n\nSo,\n\nV= (\u221a41 *12\u221a21 /\u221a41 *d3 ) /6= (12\u221a21 *d3 ) /6= 2\u221a21 d3.\n\nSo, V=2\u221a21 d3.\n\nSo, if I can find d3, then I can find V.\n\nFrom equation 3: d3\u00b2=89 -d1\u00b2 -d2\u00b2.\n\nWe have d1=25\u221a41 /41, so d1\u00b2=625/41.\n\nd2\u00b2= (556\u00b2 *861 ) / (63\u00b2 )= (309,136 *861 ) / 3969.\n\nWait, 556\u00b2=309,136.\n\nWait, but this is getting too messy. Maybe instead, find d3 in terms of other variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find d3 from another equation.\n\nWait, from equation 1: (d1 -c1)^2 + (d2 -c2)^2 +d3\u00b2=41.\n\nWe know (d1 -c1)^2=81/41.\n\nSo,\n\n81/41 + (d2 -c2)^2 +d3\u00b2=41.\n\nSo,\n\n(d2 -c2)^2 +d3\u00b2=41 -81/41= (1681 -81)/41=1600/41.\n\nBut from equation 3: d2\u00b2 +d3\u00b2=3024/41.\n\nSubtracting,\n\n(d2\u00b2 +d3\u00b2 ) - [ (d2 -c2 )^2 +d3\u00b2 ]=3024/41 -1600/41=1424/41.\n\nWhich gives 2 c2 d2 -c2\u00b2=1424/41.\n\nWhich we used earlier to find d2.\n\nBut perhaps, instead, express d3\u00b2=3024/41 -d2\u00b2.\n\nPlug into equation 1:\n\n81/41 + (d2 -c2 )^2 +3024/41 -d2\u00b2=41.\n\nSimplify:\n\n81/41 +3024/41 + (d2\u00b2 -2 c2 d2 +c2\u00b2 ) -d2\u00b2=41.\n\nSo,\n\n(81 +3024)/41 + (-2 c2 d2 +c2\u00b2 )=41.\n\nSo,\n\n3105/41 -2 c2 d2 +c2\u00b2=41.\n\nWe know c2\u00b2=3024/41.\n\nSo,\n\n3105/41 +3024/41 -2 c2 d2=41.\n\nCompute 3105 +3024=6129.\n\nSo,\n\n6129/41 -2 c2 d2=41.\n\n6129 \u00f741=149.487... Wait, 41*149=6109, 6129-6109=20. So, 6129/41=149 +20/41=149.4878.\n\nBut 41 is 41, so 6129/41=149 + 20/41.\n\nSo,\n\n149 +20/41 -2 c2 d2=41.\n\nThus,\n\n-2 c2 d2=41 -149 -20/41= -108 -20/41= - (108 +20/41 )= - (108*41 +20 ) /41= - (4428 +20)/41= -4448/41.\n\nThus,\n\n-2 c2 d2= -4448/41.\n\nMultiply both sides by (-1):\n\n2 c2 d2=4448/41.\n\nSo,\n\nd2= (4448/41 )/(2 c2 )= (2224/41 ) /c2.\n\nWhich is consistent with what we had earlier.\n\nBut I still can't find d3.\n\nWait, perhaps from the scalar triple product.\n\nWe have V=2\u221a21 d3.\n\nBut I also can compute V using the Cayley-Menger determinant, which might be easier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should proceed with computing the determinant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use another approach to find the volume.\n\nWait, considering that all opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron can be inscribed in a rectangular box, similar to how a rectangular box can be used to compute the volume of a tetrahedron with perpendicular edges.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume using Heron's formula for each face and then use the formula for the volume in terms of face areas and dihedral angles, but that seems complicated.\n\nWait, another thought: Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron is \"equifacial,\" meaning all faces are congruent. Wait, but in this case, the edges are AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD, but the faces may not necessarily be congruent.\n\nWait, let me check. For example, triangle ABC has sides AB=\u221a41, AC=\u221a80, BC=\u221a89. Similarly, triangle ADC has sides AD=\u221a89, DC=\u221a41, AC=\u221a80. So, triangles ABC and ADC have the same side lengths, so they are congruent. Similarly, the other faces: BCD has sides BC=\u221a89, CD=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80. And ABD has sides AB=\u221a41, AD=\u221a89, BD=\u221a80. So, all faces are congruent triangles, each with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89.\n\nSo, the tetrahedron is isohedral, meaning all faces are congruent. So, each face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89.\n\nSo, the area of each face can be computed, and since all faces are congruent, the total surface area S is 4 times the area of one face.\n\nThat might be helpful.\n\nSo, first, compute the area of one face.\n\nUsing Heron's formula.\n\nFor triangle with sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter s=(a + b + c)/2.\n\nBut wait, with square roots, this might be complicated, but perhaps we can compute s\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me compute s.\n\ns= (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89 ) /2.\n\nBut maybe instead, compute the area squared, since Heron's formula is sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use another formula for area given three sides.\n\nAlternatively, compute the area using vectors, but since all faces are congruent, perhaps it's better to compute the area of one face.\n\nWait, let me compute the area of triangle ABC.\n\nUsing Heron's formula.\n\nCompute s= (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89 ) /2.\n\nCompute s(s -\u221a41)(s -\u221a80)(s -\u221a89 ).\n\nThis seems messy, but perhaps I can compute it numerically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use another formula, such as 1/2 ab sin\u03b8.\n\nBut without knowing the angle, that might not help.\n\nWait, perhaps compute the area using the formula:\n\nArea= (1/4)\u221a(4a\u00b2b\u00b2 - (c\u00b2 -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 )\u00b2 )\n\nWhere c is the side opposite the angle between a and b.\n\nWait, that's another formula.\n\nSo, let me take sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nCompute 4a\u00b2b\u00b2 - (c\u00b2 -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 )\u00b2.\n\nFirst, compute a\u00b2=41, b\u00b2=80, c\u00b2=89.\n\nCompute 4a\u00b2b\u00b2=4*41*80=4*3280=13120.\n\nCompute c\u00b2 -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2=89 -41 -80= -32.\n\nSo, (c\u00b2 -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 )\u00b2= (-32)^2=1024.\n\nSo,\n\nArea\u00b2= (1/16)(13120 -1024 )= (1/16)(12096 )=756.\n\nSo, Area=\u221a756=\u221a(36*21 )=6\u221a21.\n\nSo, each face has area 6\u221a21.\n\nThus, the total surface area S=4*6\u221a21=24\u221a21.\n\nThat's a useful piece of information.\n\nSo, S=24\u221a21.\n\nNow, to find the inradius r=3V/S.\n\nSo, once I have V, I can compute r.\n\nSo, I need to compute V.\n\nWait, since all faces are congruent and the tetrahedron is isohedral, perhaps the volume can be computed using another formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with congruent faces.\n\nWait, but I think the Cayley-Menger determinant is the way to go.\n\nSo, back to the determinant.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant D is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0  41  80   89  |\n| 1  41   0  89   80  |\n| 1  80  89    0   41  |\n| 1  89  80   41    0  |\n\nI need to compute D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can perform row and column operations to simplify the determinant.\n\nNote that the matrix is symmetric, so perhaps we can use properties of determinants for symmetric matrices.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps subtract rows to create zeros.\n\nLet me try subtracting Row 1 from Rows 2,3,4.\n\nRow 2 becomes Row2 - Row1:\n\nRow2: 1-1=0, 41-0=41, 0-41=-41, 89-80=9, 80-89=-9.\n\nSimilarly, Row3 becomes Row3 - Row1:\n\n1-1=0, 80-0=80, 89-41=48, 0-80=-80, 41-89=-48.\n\nRow4 becomes Row4 - Row1:\n\n1-1=0,89-0=89,80-41=39,41-80=-39,0-89=-89.\n\nSo, the matrix after row operations:\n\nRow0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow1:1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow2:0,41,-41, 9,-9\n\nRow3:0,80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow4:0,89,39,-39,-89\n\nNow, the determinant remains the same, as row operations don't change it.\n\nNow, since the first column has 0s except for the first element, we can expand along the first column.\n\nThe determinant D is:\n\n0 * minor -1 * minor +0 -0 +0.\n\nSo, D= -1 * minor of element (1,0).\n\nThe minor is the determinant of the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing Row1 and Column0.\n\nSo, the minor is:\n\n| 41  -41    9    -9  |\n| 80   48   -80  -48  |\n| 89   39   -39  -89  |\n| 1    1     1     1  |\n\nWait, no. Wait, the minor is the determinant of the matrix after removing Row1 and Column0. So, the remaining rows are Row0, Row2, Row3, Row4, and the columns are 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo, the minor matrix is:\n\nRow0: 1,1,1,1\n\nRow2:41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow3:80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow4:89,39,-39,-89\n\nSo, the minor is the determinant of:\n\n|1   1    1     1   |\n|41 -41   9    -9   |\n|80 48  -80   -48   |\n|89 39  -39   -89   |\n\nSo, D= -1 * det(minor).\n\nLet me compute det(minor).\n\nLet me denote this 4x4 matrix as M.\n\nM:\n\nRow0:1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow2:80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow3:89,39,-39,-89\n\nCompute det(M).\n\nThis is a 4x4 determinant. Let's see if we can perform more row operations to simplify it.\n\nFirst, perhaps subtract Row1 from Rows2 and 3 to create zeros in the first column.\n\nRow2 becomes Row2 -41*Row0: 80 -41*1=39, 48 -41*1=7, -80 -41*1=-121, -48 -41*1=-89.\n\nWait, no, wait: To eliminate the first element in Rows2 and 3, we can subtract multiples of Row0.\n\nWait, Row0 is [1,1,1,1], so to eliminate the first element in Row2 (which is 80), we can subtract 80*Row0 from Row2.\n\nSimilarly, for Row3, subtract 89*Row0.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nRow2_new=Row2 -80*Row0:\n\n80 -80*1=0\n\n48 -80*1= -32\n\n-80 -80*1= -160\n\n-48 -80*1= -128\n\nSimilarly, Row3_new=Row3 -89*Row0:\n\n89-89*1=0\n\n39 -89*1= -50\n\n-39 -89*1= -128\n\n-89 -89*1= -178\n\nSo, the matrix M becomes:\n\nRow0:1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow2:0,-32,-160,-128\n\nRow3:0,-50,-128,-178\n\nNow, the determinant remains the same because we're performing row operations that don't change the determinant.\n\nNow, the matrix is upper triangular in the first column, so we can expand along the first column.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n1 * det(minor) -0 +0 -0.\n\nSo, det(M)= det(minor), where the minor is the 3x3 matrix:\n\nRow1:-41,9,-9\n\nRow2:-32,-160,-128\n\nRow3:-50,-128,-178\n\nSo, compute the determinant of this 3x3 matrix.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n| -41   9    -9  |\n| -32 -160 -128 |\n| -50 -128 -178 |\n\nCompute this determinant.\n\nUsing the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion.\n\nI'll do cofactor expansion along the first row.\n\ndet= -41 * det[ -160, -128; -128, -178 ] -9 * det[ -32, -128; -50, -178 ] + (-9)* det[ -32, -160; -50, -128 ].\n\nCompute each minor:\n\nFirst minor: det[ -160, -128; -128, -178 ].\n\n= (-160)(-178) - (-128)(-128 )\n\n= 28480 - 16384=12096.\n\nSecond minor: det[ -32, -128; -50, -178 ].\n\n= (-32)(-178) - (-128)(-50 )\n\n= 5696 - 6400= -704.\n\nThird minor: det[ -32, -160; -50, -128 ].\n\n= (-32)(-128) - (-160)(-50 )\n\n= 4096 - 8000= -3904.\n\nNow, plug into the determinant:\n\ndet= -41*(12096) -9*(-704) + (-9)*(-3904 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-41*12096= -41*12096. Let's compute 40*12096=483,840. 1*12096=12,096. So, 483,840 +12,096=495,936. So, -41*12096= -495,936.\n\n-9*(-704)=6336.\n\n-9*(-3904)=35,136.\n\nSo, det= -495,936 +6,336 +35,136.\n\nCompute:\n\n-495,936 +6,336= -489,600.\n\n-489,600 +35,136= -454,464.\n\nSo, det(M)= -454,464.\n\nThus, the minor determinant is -454,464.\n\nSo, the original determinant D= -1 * (-454,464 )=454,464.\n\nTherefore, 288 V\u00b2=454,464.\n\nThus, V\u00b2=454,464 /288.\n\nCompute 454,464 \u00f7288.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16: 454,464 \u00f716=28,404; 288 \u00f716=18.\n\nSo, 28,404 /18=1,578.\n\nSo, V\u00b2=1,578.\n\nThus, V=\u221a1,578.\n\nSimplify \u221a1,578.\n\nFactor 1,578: divide by 2=789. 789 \u00f73=263. 263 is a prime.\n\nSo, 1,578=2*3*263.\n\nThus, \u221a1,578=\u221a(2*3*263 ). Since 263 is prime, no square factors.\n\nSo, V=\u221a(2*3*263 )=\u221a1578.\n\nWait, but earlier steps: 454,464 \u00f7288=1,578.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, V=\u221a1578.\n\nWait, but 1578= 2*3*263. So, it can't be simplified further.\n\nSo, V=\u221a1578.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I was trying the coordinates approach, I had V=2\u221a21 d3.\n\nSo, if V=\u221a1578, then d3=\u221a1578/(2\u221a21 )=\u221a(1578/42 )=\u221a(789/21 ).\n\nWait, 789 \u00f721=37.571... Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nBut anyway, I have V=\u221a1578.\n\nBut let me check the calculation because 454,464 \u00f7288=1,578.\n\nBut 288*1,578=288*(1,500 +78)=288*1,500=432,000; 288*78=22,464. So, 432,000 +22,464=454,464. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, V=\u221a1578.\n\nNow, the inradius r=3V/S.\n\nWe have S=24\u221a21.\n\nSo,\n\nr=3*\u221a1578 / (24\u221a21 )= (3/24)*\u221a1578 /\u221a21= (1/8)*\u221a(1578/21 ).\n\nSimplify 1578/21.\n\nDivide 1578 by 21:\n\n21*75=1,575. 1578-1,575=3. So, 1578/21=75 +3/21=75 +1/7=75.142857...\n\nBut as a fraction, 1578/21= (1578 \u00f73)/(21 \u00f73)=526/7.\n\nSo, \u221a(526/7 )=\u221a(526)/\u221a7.\n\nBut 526=2*263, and 263 is prime. So, \u221a526 is simplified.\n\nThus,\n\nr= (1/8)*\u221a(526/7 )=\u221a526/(8\u221a7 ).\n\nRationalize denominator:\n\nr=\u221a526 *\u221a7 / (8*7 )=\u221a(526*7 ) /56.\n\nCompute 526*7=3,682.\n\nSo, r=\u221a3682 /56.\n\nBut 3,682 factors: 3,682 \u00f72=1,841. 1,841 \u00f77=263. So, 3,682=2*7*263.\n\nSo, \u221a3682=\u221a(2*7*263 ). No square factors, so it's simplified.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought S=24\u221a21. Is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nEach face has area 6\u221a21, and there are 4 faces, so S=24\u221a21. Correct.\n\nAnd V=\u221a1578. So, r=3V/S=3\u221a1578/(24\u221a21 )=\u221a1578/(8\u221a21 ).\n\nBut 1578= 2*3*263. 21=3*7.\n\nSo, \u221a1578/\u221a21=\u221a(1578/21 )=\u221a(75.142857...)=\u221a(75 +1/7 ).\n\nBut 1578/21=75.142857=75 +1/7=526/7.\n\nWait, 75*7=525, so 525+1=526. So, 526/7.\n\nThus, \u221a(526/7 ).\n\nSo, r=\u221a(526/7 ) /8=\u221a526 / (8\u221a7 ).\n\nRationalize:\n\nr=\u221a526 *\u221a7 / (8*7 )=\u221a(526*7 ) /56=\u221a3682 /56.\n\nBut 3682=2*7*263, which can't be simplified further.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the distance can be written as m\u221an /p, where n is square-free.\n\nSo, r=\u221a3682 /56.\n\nBut 3682=2*7*263, all primes, so square-free.\n\nThus, m=1, n=3682, p=56.\n\nWait, but 3682 and 56: do they have common factors?\n\n56=8*7.\n\n3682 \u00f77=526, which is exact because 7*526=3,682.\n\nSo, 3682=7*526.\n\nSo, \u221a3682=\u221a(7*526 ). 526=2*263, which is square-free.\n\nSo, \u221a3682=\u221a(7*2*263 )=\u221a14*263.\n\nBut 14=2*7, so \u221a3682=\u221a(2*7*263 ).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, earlier I had V=\u221a1578, which is \u221a(2*3*263 ).\n\nThen, r=3V/S=3\u221a(2*3*263 )/(24\u221a21 )= (3\u221a(2*3*263 )) / (24\u221a(3*7 ))= (3\u221a(2*3*263 )) / (24\u221a3\u221a7 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\nCancel 3 in numerator and denominator: 3/24=1/8.\n\nCancel \u221a3: \u221a(2*3*263 )/\u221a3=\u221a2 *\u221a263.\n\nThus,\n\nr= (\u221a2 *\u221a263 ) / (8\u221a7 )=\u221a(2*263 )/(8\u221a7 )=\u221a526/(8\u221a7 ).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a7:\n\nr=\u221a(526*7 )/(8*7 )=\u221a3682 /56.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, r=\u221a3682 /56.\n\nBut 3682=2*7*263. So, n=3682 is square-free? Wait, 3682 is divisible by 2, but 2 is square-free. 7 is square-free, 263 is square-free. So, yes, n=3682 is square-free.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"n is not divisible by the square of any prime,\" which is correct for 3682.\n\nSo, the distance is r=\u221a3682 /56.\n\nBut 3682=2*7*263. So, can't be simplified further.\n\nSo, m=1, n=3682, p=56.\n\nBut wait, 56 and 1 are relatively prime, yes.\n\nSo, m +n +p=1 +3682 +56= 1 +3682=3683; 3683 +56=3739.\n\nWait, but that seems like a very large number, 3739. That seems unlikely for an Olympiad problem. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me double-check the Cayley-Menger determinant calculation.\n\nEarlier, I found that the determinant D=454,464.\n\nThen, 288 V\u00b2=454,464 => V\u00b2=454,464 /288= 1,578.\n\nThus, V=\u221a1578.\n\nBut 1578=2*3*263.\n\nBut when I computed the determinant of the minor, I got -454,464, so D=454,464.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the minor determinant.\n\nLet me recompute the 3x3 determinant.\n\nThe minor matrix after row operations was:\n\n| -41   9    -9  |\n| -32 -160 -128 |\n| -50 -128 -178 |\n\nCompute its determinant.\n\nI did cofactor expansion along the first row:\n\n-41 * det[ -160, -128; -128, -178 ] -9 * det[ -32, -128; -50, -178 ] + (-9)* det[ -32, -160; -50, -128 ].\n\nFirst minor: det[ -160, -128; -128, -178 ].\n\n= (-160)(-178) - (-128)(-128 )=28,480 -16,384=12,096.\n\nSecond minor: det[ -32, -128; -50, -178 ].\n\n= (-32)(-178) - (-128)(-50 )=5,696 -6,400= -704.\n\nThird minor: det[ -32, -160; -50, -128 ].\n\n= (-32)(-128) - (-160)(-50 )=4,096 -8,000= -3,904.\n\nThus, determinant= (-41)(12,096) + (-9)(-704) + (-9)(-3,904).\n\nWait, no: the cofactor expansion is:\n\n= (-41)(12,096) -9*(-704) + (-9)*(-3,904 )\n\nSo,\n\n= -495,936 +6,336 +35,136.\n\nWait,  -495,936 +6,336= -489,600.\n\nThen, -489,600 +35,136= -454,464.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the minor determinant is -454,464, so D= -1*(-454,464 )=454,464.\n\nThus, 288 V\u00b2=454,464 => V\u00b2=1,578.\n\nSo, V=\u221a1578.\n\nHmm, so that seems correct.\n\nThen, r=3V/S=3\u221a1578/(24\u221a21 )=\u221a1578/(8\u221a21 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\u221a1578/\u221a21=\u221a(1578/21 )=\u221a75.142857=\u221a(75 +1/7 )=\u221a(526/7 ).\n\nSo, r=\u221a(526/7 ) /8=\u221a526/(8\u221a7 )=\u221a(526*7 )/(8*7 )=\u221a3682 /56.\n\nHmm, so it's correct.\n\nBut 3682 is a large number, but perhaps that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, 526 is 2*263, and 263 is a prime, so yeah, 526 is square-free.\n\nSo, n=3682, which is 2*7*263, which is square-free.\n\nSo, the answer is r=\u221a3682 /56, so m=1, n=3682, p=56.\n\nThus, m +n +p=1 +3682 +56=3739.\n\nBut that seems too big. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the determinant.\n\nWait, let me check the Cayley-Menger determinant again.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0  41  80   89  |\n| 1  41   0  89   80  |\n| 1  80  89    0   41  |\n| 1  89  80   41    0  |\n\nI expanded along the first column after subtracting Row1 from Rows2,3,4.\n\nThe minor determinant was:\n\n|1   1    1     1   |\n|41 -41   9    -9   |\n|80 48  -80   -48   |\n|89 39  -39   -89   |\n\nWhich after row operations became:\n\n|1   1    1     1   |\n|41 -41   9    -9   |\n|0  -32 -160  -128  |\n|0  -50 -128  -178  |\n\nThen, expanding along the first column gave the minor determinant as the 3x3 determinant:\n\n| -41   9    -9  |\n| -32 -160 -128 |\n| -50 -128 -178 |\n\nWhich computed to -454,464.\n\nThus, D= -1*(-454,464 )=454,464.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.\n\nWait, the determinant is computed as (-1)^(i+j) * minor for each element.\n\nBut when expanding along the first column, the cofactor for element (1,0) is (-1)^(1+0)*M10, where M10 is the minor.\n\nSince (1,0) is the second row, first column, the cofactor is (-1)^(1+0)*M10= (-1)*M10.\n\nWait, in my calculation earlier, I thought D= -1 * minor, but perhaps I had an error in the sign.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nWhen expanding along the first column, the determinant is sum_{i=0}^{4} (-1)^{i+0} * M_{i,0} * det(minor).\n\nBut in our case, after row operations, the first column has 0s except for the first element (0,0).\n\nWait, no, after row operations, the first column is:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nWait, no, no, I think I messed up the row operations.\n\nWait, no, initially, after subtracting Row1 from Rows2,3,4, the first column became:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nSo, when expanding along the first column, only the element at (1,0) is non-zero, which is 1.\n\nThus, the determinant D=1 * (-1)^{1+0} * det(minor).\n\nWhich is D= (-1)^1 * det(minor)= -det(minor).\n\nEarlier, I thought D= -1 * minor, but actually, it's -det(minor).\n\nWait, in the previous calculation, I had D= -1 * (-454,464 )=454,464.\n\nBut if D= -det(minor)= -(-454,464 )=454,464.\n\nSo, that part was correct.\n\nThus, 288 V\u00b2=454,464 => V\u00b2=1,578 => V=\u221a1578.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nThus, r=3V/S=3\u221a1578/(24\u221a21 )=\u221a1578/(8\u221a21 )=\u221a(1578/21 ) /8=\u221a75.142857 /8=\u221a(526/7 ) /8=\u221a526/(8\u221a7 )=\u221a3682 /56.\n\nSo, the answer is \u221a3682 /56, which is m\u221an /p where m=1, n=3682, p=56.\n\nThus, m +n +p=1 +3682 +56=3739.\n\nBut that seems very large, so I'm a bit unsure. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the surface area S is incorrect.\n\nEarlier, I computed each face area as 6\u221a21, so S=24\u221a21.\n\nBut let me double-check the face area.\n\nUsing Heron's formula for a triangle with sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nCompute s=(\u221a41 +\u221a80 +\u221a89 )/2.\n\nBut Heron's formula is \u221a[s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c)].\n\nAlternatively, I used another formula earlier and got the area as 6\u221a21.\n\nWait, let me recompute that.\n\nI used the formula:\n\nArea= (1/4)\u221a(4a\u00b2b\u00b2 - (c\u00b2 -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 )\u00b2 )\n\nWith a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nCompute 4a\u00b2b\u00b2=4*41*80=4*3280=13120.\n\nc\u00b2 -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2=89 -41 -80= -32.\n\nSo, (c\u00b2 -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 )\u00b2=1024.\n\nThus, Area= (1/4)\u221a(13120 -1024 )=(1/4)\u221a12096.\n\n\u221a12096=\u221a(16*756)=4\u221a756.\n\nSo, Area= (1/4)*4\u221a756=\u221a756.\n\nBut 756=36*21, so \u221a756=6\u221a21.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, each face area is 6\u221a21, so S=24\u221a21.\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct, and the answer is 3739.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume using another method.\n\nWait, another approach: Since all edges are known, perhaps the volume can be computed using the formula for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal.\n\nI found a resource that says that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal (AB=CD=a, AC=BD=b, AD=BC=c), the volume is V= sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2 ) ) / ( 6\u221a2 ).\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nWait, I think the formula might be similar to the formula for a rhombic tetrahedron.\n\nWait, let me check.\n\nWait, according to some references, for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, the volume can be computed using the formula:\n\nV = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / ( 6\u221a2 )\n\nBut I need to confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the same as the formula for the volume of a parallelepiped, but adjusted for tetrahedron.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nWait, in the case where all opposite edges are equal, the volume can be computed using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / ( 6\u221a2 )\n\nSo, let me plug in the values.\n\nHere, a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 -c\u00b2=41 +80 -89=32.\n\na\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -b\u00b2=41 +89 -80=50.\n\nb\u00b2 +c\u00b2 -a\u00b2=80 +89 -41=128.\n\nSo,\n\nV= sqrt(32 *50 *128 ) / (6\u221a2 )\n\nCompute 32*50=1600; 1600*128=204,800.\n\nSo,\n\nV= sqrt(204,800 ) / (6\u221a2 )= sqrt(204800 )/(6\u221a2 ).\n\nCompute sqrt(204800 )=sqrt(2048 *100 )=10*sqrt(2048 ).\n\nBut 2048=1024*2=32\u00b2*2. So, sqrt(2048 )=32\u221a2.\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(204800 )=10*32\u221a2=320\u221a2.\n\nThus,\n\nV=320\u221a2 / (6\u221a2 )=320/6=160/3.\n\nSo, V=160/3.\n\nWait, that's a different result than before. So, which one is correct?\n\nEarlier, via Cayley-Menger determinant, I got V=\u221a1578\u224839.72.\n\nBut 160/3\u224853.333.\n\nThese are different. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, the formula I used: V= sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / ( 6\u221a2 )\n\nBut wait, I think that formula is for a specific type of tetrahedron, maybe when all faces are congruent, which is the case here.\n\nWait, but in this case, the formula gives V=160/3\u224853.333.\n\nBut via Cayley-Menger determinant, I got V=\u221a1578\u224839.72.\n\nThese are conflicting results, so I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, let me recompute the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nWait, when I computed the determinant D, I got 454,464, leading to V=\u221a1578.\n\nBut according to the formula, V=160/3.\n\nThus, 160/3 squared is 25,600/9\u22482,844.444.\n\nBut via determinant, V\u00b2=1,578\u22481,578.\n\nSo, these are different.\n\nHence, I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, let me try to compute the volume using the formula for the given edge lengths.\n\nGiven AB=CD=\u221a41, AC=BD=\u221a80, BC=AD=\u221a89.\n\nUsing the formula for the volume of such a tetrahedron.\n\nI found a formula online that says:\n\nIf a tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, then its volume is V= (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / (6\u221a2 )\n\nSo, plugging in a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 -c\u00b2=41 +80 -89=32.\n\na\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -b\u00b2=41 +89 -80=50.\n\nb\u00b2 +c\u00b2 -a\u00b2=80 +89 -41=128.\n\nSo,\n\nV= sqrt(32 *50 *128 ) / (6\u221a2 )= sqrt(204,800 )/(6\u221a2 )= 452.548 / (8.485 )\u224853.333.\n\nWhich is 160/3.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nThus, I must have made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant calculation.\n\nWait, let me check the Cayley-Menger determinant again.\n\nThe determinant I computed was 454,464, leading to V=\u221a1578.\n\nBut according to the formula, it should be V=160/3.\n\nSo, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the determinant.\n\nWait, the determinant was:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0  41  80   89  |\n| 1  41   0  89   80  |\n| 1  80  89    0   41  |\n| 1  89  80   41    0  |\n\nI performed row operations: subtracting Row1 from Rows2,3,4.\n\nWhich resulted in:\n\nRow0:0,1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow2:0,41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow3:0,80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow4:0,89,39,-39,-89\n\nThen, expanding along the first column, which had 0s except for Row1.\n\nThus, D= (-1)^{1+0} * M10, where M10 is the minor.\n\nSo, D= -det(Minor).\n\nThe minor was:\n\nRow0:1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow2:80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow3:89,39,-39,-89\n\nThen, I performed row operations on this minor matrix:\n\nSubtract 41*Row0 from Row1: Row1 becomes Row1 -41*Row0.\n\nSimilarly, subtract 80*Row0 from Row2, and 89*Row0 from Row3.\n\nWait, no, I think I subtracted multiples of Row0 from Rows2 and 3 to eliminate the first column.\n\nBut perhaps I should have done it differently.\n\nWait, to eliminate the first column in the minor matrix, which is:\n\nRow0:1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow2:80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow3:89,39,-39,-89\n\nSo, to eliminate the first column, subtract 41*Row0 from Row1, 80*Row0 from Row2, 89*Row0 from Row3.\n\nThus,\n\nRow1_new=Row1 -41*Row0: 41-41=0, -41-41= -82, 9-41= -32, -9-41= -50.\n\nRow2_new=Row2 -80*Row0:80-80=0,48-80= -32, -80-80= -160, -48-80= -128.\n\nRow3_new=Row3 -89*Row0:89-89=0,39-89= -50, -39-89= -128, -89-89= -178.\n\nSo, the minor matrix becomes:\n\nRow0:1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:0,-82,-32,-50\n\nRow2:0,-32,-160,-128\n\nRow3:0,-50,-128,-178\n\nNow, the determinant is the same as the original, since we're performing row operations.\n\nNow, expanding along the first column, which has 1 and the rest 0s.\n\nThus, determinant=1 * det(minor) where minor is the 3x3 matrix:\n\nRow1:-82,-32,-50\n\nRow2:-32,-160,-128\n\nRow3:-50,-128,-178\n\nSo, compute this determinant.\n\nCompute using cofactor expansion along Row1:\n\n-82 * det[ -160,-128; -128,-178 ] - (-32)*det[ -32,-128; -50,-178 ] + (-50)*det[ -32,-160; -50,-128 ]\n\nCompute each minor:\n\nFirst minor: det[ -160,-128; -128,-178 ]= (-160)(-178) - (-128)(-128 )=28,480 -16,384=12,096.\n\nSecond minor: det[ -32,-128; -50,-178 ]= (-32)(-178) - (-128)(-50 )=5,696 -6,400= -704.\n\nThird minor: det[ -32,-160; -50,-128 ]= (-32)(-128) - (-160)(-50 )=4,096 -8,000= -3,904.\n\nThus, determinant= (-82)(12,096) - (-32)(-704) + (-50)(-3,904 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-82 *12,096= Let's compute 80*12,096=967,680; 2*12,096=24,192.

      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the inradius of a tetrahedron with specific edge lengths. The tetrahedron has opposite edges equal: \\(AB = CD = \\sqrt{41}\\), \\(AC = BD = \\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(BC = AD = \\sqrt{89}\\). The inradius \\(r\\) can be calculated using the formula \\(r = \\frac{3V}{S}\\), where \\(V\\) is the volume and \\(S\\) is the total surface area of the tetrahedron.\n\nFirst, we calculate the volume \\(V\\) using a known formula for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{\\sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)}}{6\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(a = \\sqrt{41}\\), \\(b = \\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(c = \\sqrt{89}\\):\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 - c^2 = 41 + 80 - 89 = 32\n\\]\n\\[\na^2 + c^2 - b^2 = 41 + 89 - 80 = 50\n\\]\n\\[\nb^2 + c^2 - a^2 = 80 + 89 - 41 = 128\n\\]\n\\[\nV = \\frac{\\sqrt{32 \\times 50 \\times 128}}{6\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{204800}}{6\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{452.548}{6\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{160}{3}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total surface area \\(S\\). Each face is a triangle with sides \\(\\sqrt{41}\\), \\(\\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{89}\\). Using Heron's formula, the area of one face is \\(6\\sqrt{21}\\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer should be in the form m\u221an / p, and then I need to find m + n + p. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the radius of the inscribed sphere) can be found using the formula:\n\nr = 3V / S\n\nwhere V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find both V and S.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't give me all the edges. It says AB=CD=\u221a41, AC=BD=\u221a80, and BC=AD=\u221a89. Hmm, so it's a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. I think such a tetrahedron is called \"isohedral\" or maybe \"edge-transitive,\" but I'm not sure. Anyway, the key is that opposite edges are equal. That might help in computing the volume.\n\nI need to figure out the volume of the tetrahedron. One way to compute the volume is using the Cayley-Menger determinant. I remember the formula for the volume V of a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD is given by:\n\n288 V\u00b2 = | determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix |\n\nThe Cayley-Menger matrix is a 5x5 matrix constructed from the edge lengths. Let me recall the exact structure. It's a matrix where the first row is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1], the first column is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]^T, and the diagonal from (2,2) onwards are 0, and the other entries are the squares of the distances between the points.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it out. Let me denote the points as A, B, C, D. The Cayley-Menger determinant for points A, B, C, D is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0  AB\u00b2 AC\u00b2 AD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AB\u00b2 0  BC\u00b2 BD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AC\u00b2 BC\u00b2 0  CD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AD\u00b2 BD\u00b2 CD\u00b2 0  |\n\nSo, the determinant of this matrix divided by 288 gives V squared. So, I can compute this determinant and then take the square root.\n\nLet me plug in the given values. AB = CD = \u221a41, so AB\u00b2 = 41, CD\u00b2 = 41. Similarly, AC = BD = \u221a80, so AC\u00b2 = 80, BD\u00b2 = 80. BC = AD = \u221a89, so BC\u00b2 = 89, AD\u00b2 = 89.\n\nSo, let's construct the Cayley-Menger matrix:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm putting the right values in the right places. The first row is [0,1,1,1,1], the first column is [0,1,1,1,1]^T. Then, the (1,2) entry is AB\u00b2=41, (1,3) is AC\u00b2=80, (1,4) is AD\u00b2=89. Similarly, (2,1)=41, (2,3)=0, (2,4)=BC\u00b2=89, (2,5)=BD\u00b2=80. Wait, is that correct? Wait, no, because the points are A,B,C,D. So, the rows correspond to points A,B,C,D. So, the entry (i,j) for i,j >=1 is the square of the distance between point i and point j. So, let's list the points as A(1), B(2), C(3), D(4).\n\nSo, the entries are:\n\n(1,2): AB\u00b2=41\n\n(1,3): AC\u00b2=80\n\n(1,4): AD\u00b2=89\n\n(2,3): BC\u00b2=89\n\n(2,4): BD\u00b2=80\n\n(3,4): CD\u00b2=41\n\nSo, the matrix would be:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nYes, that looks correct.\n\nSo, now I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. Hmm, that's going to be a bit involved, but let me try to do it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize that this tetrahedron has some symmetry, which might make the determinant easier to compute.\n\nWait, since opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron is symmetric in some way, maybe it's a kind of \"equifacial\" tetrahedron or something. I'm not sure, but perhaps the volume can be computed in a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume by dividing the tetrahedron into parts or using coordinates.\n\nWait, maybe assigning coordinates to the points would make this easier. Since all the edges have specific lengths, perhaps I can place the points in 3D space in such a way that calculations are manageable.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me place point A at the origin: A(0,0,0).\n\nLet me place point B along the x-axis: B(b,0,0).\n\nPoint C can be placed in the xy-plane: C(c1, c2, 0).\n\nPoint D will be somewhere in 3D space: D(d1, d2, d3).\n\nNow, I can use the given edge lengths to set up equations.\n\nGiven:\n\nAB = \u221a41: So, the distance from A to B is \u221a(b\u00b2 + 0 + 0) = |b| = \u221a41. So, b = \u221a41.\n\nAC = \u221a80: Distance from A to C is \u221a(c1\u00b2 + c2\u00b2 + 0) = \u221a(c1\u00b2 + c2\u00b2) = \u221a80. So, c1\u00b2 + c2\u00b2 = 80.\n\nAD = \u221a89: Distance from A to D is \u221a(d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2) = \u221a89. So, d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2 = 89.\n\nBC = \u221a89: Distance from B to C is \u221a((c1 - b)^2 + (c2 - 0)^2 + 0) = \u221a[(c1 - \u221a41)^2 + c2\u00b2] = \u221a89.\n\nSo, (c1 - \u221a41)^2 + c2\u00b2 = 89.\n\nBut we already know that c1\u00b2 + c2\u00b2 = 80. Let's subtract that equation:\n\n(c1 - \u221a41)^2 + c2\u00b2 - (c1\u00b2 + c2\u00b2) = 89 - 80 => (c1\u00b2 - 2\u221a41 c1 + 41) + c2\u00b2 - c1\u00b2 - c2\u00b2 = 9 => -2\u221a41 c1 +41=9 => -2\u221a41 c1 = -32 => c1 = (32)/(2\u221a41) = 16/\u221a41.\n\nRationalizing the denominator, c1 = (16\u221a41)/41.\n\nSo, c1 = 16\u221a41 /41.\n\nNow, plugging back into c1\u00b2 + c2\u00b2 =80:\n\n( (16\u221a41 /41)^2 ) + c2\u00b2 =80.\n\nCalculating (16\u221a41 /41)^2: (256 *41)/ (41^2) ) = (256/41).\n\nSo, 256/41 + c2\u00b2 =80 => c2\u00b2=80 -256/41= (80*41 -256)/41 = (3280 -256)/41= 3024/41.\n\nSo, c2 = sqrt(3024/41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41). Let's see, 3024= 16*189=16*9*21=16*9*3*7. So sqrt(3024)=4*3*sqrt(21)=12\u221a21.\n\nThus, c2=12\u221a21 / \u221a41= (12\u221a(21*41))/41= (12\u221a861)/41. Wait, but 861 factors: 861=3*287=3*7*41. So, \u221a861=\u221a(3*7*41)=\u221a(861). So, perhaps we can just leave it as 12\u221a861 /41, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's better to just keep c2\u00b2=3024/41 for now.\n\nMoving on.\n\nNow, let's compute the coordinates for point D. We know that CD=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80, and AD=\u221a89.\n\nSo, let's write down the distances:\n\nCD: distance from C to D is \u221a41.\n\nSo, sqrt( (d1 - c1)^2 + (d2 - c2)^2 + (d3 -0)^2 ) = \u221a41.\n\nSo, (d1 - c1)^2 + (d2 - c2)^2 + d3\u00b2=41.\n\nSimilarly, BD: distance from B to D is \u221a80.\n\nPoint B is at (\u221a41,0,0), so distance BD is sqrt( (d1 - \u221a41)^2 + (d2 -0)^2 + (d3 -0)^2 )=\u221a80.\n\nThus, (d1 -\u221a41)^2 + d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2=80.\n\nAlso, AD is \u221a89: d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2=89.\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\n1) (d1 - c1)^2 + (d2 - c2)^2 + d3\u00b2 =41\n\n2) (d1 -\u221a41)^2 + d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2=80\n\n3) d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2=89\n\nLet me write equation 2: expanding (d1 -\u221a41)^2 + d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2=80.\n\nWhich is d1\u00b2 - 2\u221a41 d1 +41 + d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2=80.\n\nBut from equation 3, d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2=89. So substituting:\n\n89 - 2\u221a41 d1 +41=80 => 130 -2\u221a41 d1=80 => -2\u221a41 d1= -50 => d1=50/(2\u221a41)=25/\u221a41=25\u221a41 /41.\n\nSo, d1=25\u221a41 /41.\n\nSimilarly, now let's substitute d1 into equation 3: (25\u221a41 /41)^2 + d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2=89.\n\nCompute (25\u221a41 /41)^2: (625 *41)/(41\u00b2)=625/41.\n\nSo, 625/41 + d2\u00b2 +d3\u00b2=89 => d2\u00b2 +d3\u00b2=89 -625/41= (89*41 -625)/41= (3649 -625)/41=3024/41.\n\nSo, d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2=3024/41.\n\nNow, let's look at equation 1: (d1 -c1)^2 + (d2 -c2)^2 +d3\u00b2=41.\n\nWe have d1=25\u221a41/41, c1=16\u221a41/41. So, d1 -c1= (25\u221a41 -16\u221a41)/41=9\u221a41/41.\n\nThus, (d1 -c1)^2= (81*41)/(41\u00b2)=81/41.\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes:\n\n81/41 + (d2 -c2)^2 + d3\u00b2=41.\n\nWhich implies (d2 -c2)^2 + d3\u00b2=41 -81/41= (41*41 -81)/41= (1681 -81)/41=1600/41.\n\nSo, (d2 -c2)^2 + d3\u00b2=1600/41.\n\nBut we also know from equation 3 that d2\u00b2 +d3\u00b2=3024/41.\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 3:\n\n(d2\u00b2 +d3\u00b2) - [(d2 -c2)^2 + d3\u00b2] = (3024/41) - (1600/41).\n\nSimplify left side:\n\nd2\u00b2 - (d2\u00b2 -2 c2 d2 + c2\u00b2 )=2 c2 d2 - c2\u00b2.\n\nRight side: (3024 -1600)/41=1424/41.\n\nSo,\n\n2 c2 d2 - c2\u00b2 =1424/41.\n\nWe know c2\u00b2=3024/41, so:\n\n2 c2 d2=1424/41 + c2\u00b2=1424/41 +3024/41=4448/41.\n\nThus,\n\nd2= (4448/(41))/(2 c2 )= (4448)/(82 c2).\n\nCompute 4448 /82: 4448 \u00f782=54.2439\u2026 Wait, let me compute 82 *54=4428, 4448-4428=20, so 54 and 20/82=54 10/41. So, 4448/82=54.2439, but as a fraction, 4448/82= 2224/41.\n\nWait, 82*2224= Let me see, 2224 \u00f782=27.121... Hmm, perhaps better to factor numerator and denominator.\n\nWait, 4448=16*278=16*(2*139)=32*139.\n\n82=2*41.\n\nSo, 4448/82= (32*139)/(2*41)=16*139/41. Hmm, 139 is a prime number, I think. So, 16*139=2224. So, 2224/41= 2224 \u00f741=54.2439, but as a fraction, it's 2224/41.\n\nSo, d2= (2224/41)/ (2 c2 )= (2224)/(82 c2 )= (1112)/(41 c2 ).\n\nBut c2 is sqrt(3024/41)=sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41)= (12\u221a21)/sqrt(41). Wait, earlier I had c2=12\u221a861 /41, but that was a mistake because 861 is 3*7*41. Wait, no, 3024= 144*21= 12\u00b2*21. So sqrt(3024)=12\u221a21. So, c2=12\u221a21 / sqrt(41)= (12\u221a(21*41))/41=12\u221a861 /41. Wait, but 861= 3*7*41, which is square-free, so that's as simplified as it gets.\n\nSo, c2=12\u221a861 /41.\n\nThus, d2= (1112)/(41 * (12\u221a861 /41 ))= (1112)/(12\u221a861 )= (278)/(3\u221a861 ).\n\nBut let me compute 1112 \u00f712: 1112 \u00f712=92.666\u2026=278/3.\n\nSo, d2=278/(3\u221a861 ). We can rationalize the denominator:\n\nd2=278\u221a861 / (3*861 )=278\u221a861 / (3*861 ).\n\nBut 861=3*7*41, so 3*861=3*3*7*41=9*7*41=2835.\n\nWait, but 278 and 2835: do they share any common factors? Let's see. 278=2*139. 2835=5*567=5*7*81=5*7*9^2. 139 is a prime number, so no common factors. So, d2=278\u221a861 /2835.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use equation 3: d2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2=3024/41.\n\nFrom equation 1, we had (d2 -c2)^2 + d3\u00b2=1600/41.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 3 gives:\n\nd2\u00b2 + d3\u00b2 - [ (d2 -c2)^2 + d3\u00b2 ] =3024/41 -1600/41.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nd2\u00b2 - (d2\u00b2 -2 c2 d2 +c2\u00b2 )=1424/41.\n\nSo, 2 c2 d2 -c2\u00b2=1424/41.\n\nWe know c2\u00b2=3024/41, so:\n\n2 c2 d2=1424/41 +3024/41=4448/41.\n\nThus, d2= (4448/(41))/(2 c2 )=4448/(82 c2 ).\n\nAs above, 4448=16*278=16*(2*139)=32*139. 82=2*41.\n\nSo, 4448/82= (32*139)/(2*41)=16*139/41=2224/41.\n\nThus, d2=2224/(41 c2 ).\n\nBut c2= sqrt(3024/41)=sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41)=12\u221a21/sqrt(41).\n\nThus, d2=2224/(41*(12\u221a21/sqrt(41)) )=2224/(41 *12\u221a21 /sqrt(41))=2224/(41*12\u221a21 /sqrt(41)).\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n41*12\u221a21 /sqrt(41)=41*12\u221a21 / (\u221a41)=41*12\u221a21 / (\u221a41)=41*12\u221a(21/41)=41*12\u221a(21/41).\n\nWait, perhaps better to write as:\n\n41*12\u221a21 /sqrt(41)=12*sqrt(41^2)*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41)=12*sqrt(41*21)=12*sqrt(861).\n\nSo, denominator is 12\u221a861.\n\nThus, d2=2224/(12\u221a861 )=556/(3\u221a861 ).\n\nAgain, rationalize:\n\nd2=556\u221a861/(3*861 ).\n\nBut 556=4*139, and 861=3*7*41. So, 3*861=3*3*7*41=9*7*41=2835.\n\nSo, d2=556\u221a861 /2835. 556 and 2835: 556=4*139, 2835=5*567=5*7*81=5*7*9^2. 139 is prime, so no common factors. So, d2=556\u221a861 /2835.\n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should instead compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant, as I initially thought, even though it's a 5x5 determinant.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0  41  80   89  |\n| 1  41   0  89   80  |\n| 1  80  89    0   41  |\n| 1  89  80   41    0  |\n\nLet me denote this determinant as D. Then, 288 V\u00b2 = |D|.\n\nSo, I need to compute D.\n\nCalculating a 5x5 determinant is a bit tedious, but maybe there's some pattern or symmetry we can exploit.\n\nLooking at the matrix, it's symmetric, which might help. Let me write down the matrix:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1,41, 0, 89,80\n\nRow 3:1,80,89, 0,41\n\nRow 4:1,89,80,41,0\n\nWait, perhaps if I subtract Row 1 from Rows 2,3,4, I can create some zeros.\n\nBut let me think: Alternatively, perhaps perform row operations to simplify the determinant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant using expansion by minors, but that's going to take a while.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this determinant is known for such symmetric tetrahedrons.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can note that the tetrahedron is \"isosceles,\" meaning that opposite edges are equal, which might imply that it's a kind of \"mirror-symmetric\" tetrahedron, which might have some properties that make the volume easier to compute.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron in terms of edge lengths when opposite edges are equal.\n\nWait, I recall that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it's called a \"equilic\" tetrahedron or something else. Maybe there's a specific formula for the volume in such cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the volume in terms of face areas and dihedral angles, but that might not be helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume by finding the coordinates as I started earlier, but that also seems complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider the coordinates approach again, but perhaps I can find vectors and use the scalar triple product.\n\nWait, from the coordinates I had earlier:\n\nA(0,0,0)\n\nB(\u221a41, 0, 0)\n\nC(16\u221a41/41, c2, 0)\n\nD(25\u221a41/41, d2, d3)\n\nBut I'm stuck with complicated expressions for d2 and d3. Maybe instead of trying to find exact coordinates, I can use the scalar triple product formula for volume.\n\nThe volume V is (1/6) | scalar triple product of vectors AB, AC, AD |.\n\nBut AB is (\u221a41,0,0)\n\nAC is (16\u221a41/41, c2,0 )\n\nAD is (25\u221a41/41, d2, d3 )\n\nSo, the scalar triple product is AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD )\n\nCompute AC \u00d7 AD first.\n\nLet me denote AC as (a, b, 0) and AD as (c, d, e). Then, AC \u00d7 AD is (b*e -0*d, 0*c -a*e, a*d - b*c )\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD = (b e, -a e, a d - b c )\n\nBut in our case, AC is (16\u221a41/41, c2, 0 ), AD is (25\u221a41/41, d2, d3 )\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD = (c2 * d3 - 0*d2, 0*25\u221a41/41 - (16\u221a41/41)*d3, (16\u221a41/41)*d2 - c2*(25\u221a41/41) )\n\nSimplify each component:\n\nFirst component: c2 d3\n\nSecond component: - (16\u221a41 /41 ) d3\n\nThird component: (16\u221a41 d2 -25\u221a41 c2 ) /41\n\nSo, the cross product vector is:\n\n( c2 d3, - (16\u221a41 /41 ) d3, (16 d2 -25 c2 )\u221a41 /41 )\n\nNow, AB is (\u221a41, 0, 0 )\n\nSo, the scalar triple product AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD ) is:\n\n\u221a41 * c2 d3 + 0 * [ - (16\u221a41 /41 ) d3 ] + 0 * [ (16 d2 -25 c2 )\u221a41 /41 ]\n\nSo, it's \u221a41 * c2 d3.\n\nThus, V= (1/6) |\u221a41 c2 d3 |.\n\nSo, V= ( \u221a41 c2 d3 ) /6.\n\nSo, if I can compute c2 and d3, then I can compute V.\n\nFrom earlier, c2= sqrt(3024/41 )= (12\u221a21 )/\u221a41.\n\nAnd from equation 3: d1\u00b2 +d2\u00b2 +d3\u00b2=89.\n\nWe have d1=25\u221a41 /41, d2= (something), d3=?\n\nWait, but from equation 1, (d1 -c1)^2 + (d2 -c2)^2 +d3\u00b2=41.\n\nWe already computed (d1 -c1)^2=81/41.\n\nSo, 81/41 + (d2 -c2)^2 +d3\u00b2=41.\n\nSo, (d2 -c2)^2 +d3\u00b2=41 -81/41= (1681 -81)/41=1600/41.\n\nBut also, from equation 3, d2\u00b2 +d3\u00b2=3024/41.\n\nSubtracting the two equations:\n\n(d2\u00b2 +d3\u00b2 ) - [ (d2 -c2)^2 +d3\u00b2 ] =3024/41 -1600/41=1424/41.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nd2\u00b2 - (d2\u00b2 - 2 c2 d2 +c2\u00b2 )=1424/41.\n\nSo, 2 c2 d2 -c2\u00b2=1424/41.\n\nWe know c2\u00b2=3024/41.\n\nSo, 2 c2 d2=1424/41 +3024/41=4448/41.\n\nThus, d2= (4448/(41))/(2 c2 )= (4448)/(82 c2 )= (2224)/(41 c2 ).\n\nSo, d2=2224/(41 c2 ).\n\nBut c2=12\u221a21 /\u221a41.\n\nSo, d2=2224/(41*(12\u221a21 /\u221a41 ))=2224/(41*12\u221a21 /\u221a41 )=2224/( (41*12\u221a21 ) /\u221a41 )=2224 *\u221a41 / (41*12\u221a21 ).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n2224=16*139.\n\n41 is prime, 12=4*3.\n\nSo,\n\nd2= (16*139 *\u221a41 ) / (41*12\u221a21 )= (16*139 *\u221a41 ) / (41*12\u221a21 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\nCancel 41: 41 in numerator and denominator cancels.\n\nSo,\n\nd2= (16*139 *\u221a41 ) / (12\u221a21 ).\n\nSimplify 16/12=4/3.\n\nSo,\n\nd2= (4*139 *\u221a41 ) / (3\u221a21 ).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21 to rationalize:\n\nd2= (4*139 *\u221a(41*21 )) / (3*21 )= (4*139 *\u221a861 ) /63.\n\nSo, d2= (556\u221a861 ) /63.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nNow, from equation 3: d1\u00b2 +d2\u00b2 +d3\u00b2=89.\n\nWe know d1=25\u221a41 /41, so d1\u00b2=625*41 / (41\u00b2 )=625/41.\n\nd2\u00b2= (556\u00b2 *861 ) / (63\u00b2 ).\n\nWait, 556\u00b2= (4*139)^2=16*139\u00b2.\n\nSo, d2\u00b2= (16*139\u00b2 *861 ) / (63\u00b2 ).\n\nBut 861=3*7*41, 63=7*9.\n\nSo,\n\nd2\u00b2= (16*139\u00b2 *3*7*41 ) / (7\u00b2 *9\u00b2 )= (16*139\u00b2 *3*41 ) / (7*81 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n16/81=16/81.\n\nSo,\n\nd2\u00b2= (16*3*139\u00b2 *41 ) / (7*81 )= (48*139\u00b2 *41 ) / (567 ).\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express d3\u00b2=89 -d1\u00b2 -d2\u00b2.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe instead, go back to the scalar triple product.\n\nWe have V= (\u221a41 c2 d3 ) /6.\n\nWe know c2=12\u221a21 /\u221a41.\n\nSo,\n\nV= (\u221a41 *12\u221a21 /\u221a41 *d3 ) /6= (12\u221a21 *d3 ) /6= 2\u221a21 d3.\n\nSo, V=2\u221a21 d3.\n\nSo, if I can find d3, then I can find V.\n\nFrom equation 3: d3\u00b2=89 -d1\u00b2 -d2\u00b2.\n\nWe have d1=25\u221a41 /41, so d1\u00b2=625/41.\n\nd2\u00b2= (556\u00b2 *861 ) / (63\u00b2 )= (309,136 *861 ) / 3969.\n\nWait, 556\u00b2=309,136.\n\nWait, but this is getting too messy.

So, 6129/41=149 +20/41=149.4878.\n\nBut 41 is 41, so 6129/41=149 + 20/41.\n\nSo,\n\n149 +20/41 -2 c2 d2=41.\n\nThus,\n\n-2 c2 d2=41 -149 -20/41= -108 -20/41= - (108 +20/41 )= - (108*41 +20 ) /41= - (4428 +20)/41= -4448/41.\n\nThus,\n\n-2 c2 d2= -4448/41.\n\nMultiply both sides by (-1):\n\n2 c2 d2=4448/41.\n\nSo,\n\nd2= (4448/41 )/(2 c2 )= (2224/41 ) /c2.\n\nWhich is consistent with what we had earlier.\n\nBut I still can't find d3.\n\nWait, perhaps from the scalar triple product.\n\nWe have V=2\u221a21 d3.\n\nBut I also can compute V using the Cayley-Menger determinant, which might be easier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should proceed with computing the determinant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use another approach to find the volume.\n\nWait, considering that all opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron can be inscribed in a rectangular box, similar to how a rectangular box can be used to compute the volume of a tetrahedron with perpendicular edges.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume using Heron's formula for each face and then use the formula for the volume in terms of face areas and dihedral angles, but that seems complicated.\n\nWait, another thought: Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron is \"equifacial,\" meaning all faces are congruent. Wait, but in this case, the edges are AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD, but the faces may not necessarily be congruent.\n\nWait, let me check. For example, triangle ABC has sides AB=\u221a41, AC=\u221a80, BC=\u221a89. Similarly, triangle ADC has sides AD=\u221a89, DC=\u221a41, AC=\u221a80. So, triangles ABC and ADC have the same side lengths, so they are congruent. Similarly, the other faces: BCD has sides BC=\u221a89, CD=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80. And ABD has sides AB=\u221a41, AD=\u221a89, BD=\u221a80. So, all faces are congruent triangles, each with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89.\n\nSo, the tetrahedron is isohedral, meaning all faces are congruent. So, each face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89.\n\nSo, the area of each face can be computed, and since all faces are congruent, the total surface area S is 4 times the area of one face.\n\nThat might be helpful.\n\nSo, first, compute the area of one face.\n\nUsing Heron's formula.\n\nFor triangle with sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter s=(a + b + c)/2.\n\nBut wait, with square roots, this might be complicated, but perhaps we can compute s\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me compute s.\n\ns= (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89 ) /2.\n\nBut maybe instead, compute the area squared, since Heron's formula is sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use another formula for area given three sides.\n\nAlternatively, compute the area using vectors, but since all faces are congruent, perhaps it's better to compute the area of one face.\n\nWait, let me compute the area of triangle ABC.\n\nUsing Heron's formula.\n\nCompute s= (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89 ) /2.\n\nCompute s(s -\u221a41)(s -\u221a80)(s -\u221a89 ).\n\nThis seems messy, but perhaps I can compute it numerically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use another formula, such as 1/2 ab sin\u03b8.\n\nBut without knowing the angle, that might not help.\n\nWait, perhaps compute the area using the formula:\n\nArea= (1/4)\u221a(4a\u00b2b\u00b2 - (c\u00b2 -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 )\u00b2 )\n\nWhere c is the side opposite the angle between a and b.\n\nWait, that's another formula.\n\nSo, let me take sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nCompute 4a\u00b2b\u00b2 - (c\u00b2 -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 )\u00b2.\n\nFirst, compute a\u00b2=41, b\u00b2=80, c\u00b2=89.\n\nCompute 4a\u00b2b\u00b2=4*41*80=4*3280=13120.\n\nCompute c\u00b2 -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2=89 -41 -80= -32.\n\nSo, (c\u00b2 -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 )\u00b2= (-32)^2=1024.\n\nSo,\n\nArea\u00b2= (1/16)(13120 -1024 )= (1/16)(12096 )=756.\n\nSo, Area=\u221a756=\u221a(36*21 )=6\u221a21.\n\nSo, each face has area 6\u221a21.\n\nThus, the total surface area S=4*6\u221a21=24\u221a21.\n\nThat's a useful piece of information.\n\nSo, S=24\u221a21.\n\nNow, to find the inradius r=3V/S.\n\nSo, once I have V, I can compute r.\n\nSo, I need to compute V.\n\nWait, since all faces are congruent and the tetrahedron is isohedral, perhaps the volume can be computed using another formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with congruent faces.\n\nWait, but I think the Cayley-Menger determinant is the way to go.\n\nSo, back to the determinant.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant D is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0  41  80   89  |\n| 1  41   0  89   80  |\n| 1  80  89    0   41  |\n| 1  89  80   41    0  |\n\nI need to compute D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can perform row and column operations to simplify the determinant.\n\nNote that the matrix is symmetric, so perhaps we can use properties of determinants for symmetric matrices.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps subtract rows to create zeros.\n\nLet me try subtracting Row 1 from Rows 2,3,4.\n\nRow 2 becomes Row2 - Row1:\n\nRow2: 1-1=0, 41-0=41, 0-41=-41, 89-80=9, 80-89=-9.\n\nSimilarly, Row3 becomes Row3 - Row1:\n\n1-1=0, 80-0=80, 89-41=48, 0-80=-80, 41-89=-48.\n\nRow4 becomes Row4 - Row1:\n\n1-1=0,89-0=89,80-41=39,41-80=-39,0-89=-89.\n\nSo, the matrix after row operations:\n\nRow0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow1:1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow2:0,41,-41, 9,-9\n\nRow3:0,80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow4:0,89,39,-39,-89\n\nNow, the determinant remains the same, as row operations don't change it.\n\nNow, since the first column has 0s except for the first element, we can expand along the first column.\n\nThe determinant D is:\n\n0 * minor -1 * minor +0 -0 +0.\n\nSo, D= -1 * minor of element (1,0).\n\nThe minor is the determinant of the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing Row1 and Column0.\n\nSo, the minor is:\n\n| 41  -41    9    -9  |\n| 80   48   -80  -48  |\n| 89   39   -39  -89  |\n| 1    1     1     1  |\n\nWait, no. Wait, the minor is the determinant of the matrix after removing Row1 and Column0. So, the remaining rows are Row0, Row2, Row3, Row4, and the columns are 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo, the minor matrix is:\n\nRow0: 1,1,1,1\n\nRow2:41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow3:80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow4:89,39,-39,-89\n\nSo, the minor is the determinant of:\n\n|1   1    1     1   |\n|41 -41   9    -9   |\n|80 48  -80   -48   |\n|89 39  -39   -89   |\n\nSo, D= -1 * det(minor).\n\nLet me compute det(minor).\n\nLet me denote this 4x4 matrix as M.\n\nM:\n\nRow0:1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow2:80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow3:89,39,-39,-89\n\nCompute det(M).\n\nThis is a 4x4 determinant. Let's see if we can perform more row operations to simplify it.\n\nFirst, perhaps subtract Row1 from Rows2 and 3 to create zeros in the first column.\n\nRow2 becomes Row2 -41*Row0: 80 -41*1=39, 48 -41*1=7, -80 -41*1=-121, -48 -41*1=-89.\n\nWait, no, wait: To eliminate the first element in Rows2 and 3, we can subtract multiples of Row0.\n\nWait, Row0 is [1,1,1,1], so to eliminate the first element in Row2 (which is 80), we can subtract 80*Row0 from Row2.\n\nSimilarly, for Row3, subtract 89*Row0.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nRow2_new=Row2 -80*Row0:\n\n80 -80*1=0\n\n48 -80*1= -32\n\n-80 -80*1= -160\n\n-48 -80*1= -128\n\nSimilarly, Row3_new=Row3 -89*Row0:\n\n89-89*1=0\n\n39 -89*1= -50\n\n-39 -89*1= -128\n\n-89 -89*1= -178\n\nSo, the matrix M becomes:\n\nRow0:1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow2:0,-32,-160,-128\n\nRow3:0,-50,-128,-178\n\nNow, the determinant remains the same because we're performing row operations that don't change the determinant.\n\nNow, the matrix is upper triangular in the first column, so we can expand along the first column.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n1 * det(minor) -0 +0 -0.\n\nSo, det(M)= det(minor), where the minor is the 3x3 matrix:\n\nRow1:-41,9,-9\n\nRow2:-32,-160,-128\n\nRow3:-50,-128,-178\n\nSo, compute the determinant of this 3x3 matrix.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n| -41   9    -9  |\n| -32 -160 -128 |\n| -50 -128 -178 |\n\nCompute this determinant.\n\nUsing the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion.\n\nI'll do cofactor expansion along the first row.\n\ndet= -41 * det[ -160, -128; -128, -178 ] -9 * det[ -32, -128; -50, -178 ] + (-9)* det[ -32, -160; -50, -128 ].\n\nCompute each minor:\n\nFirst minor: det[ -160, -128; -128, -178 ].\n\n= (-160)(-178) - (-128)(-128 )\n\n= 28480 - 16384=12096.\n\nSecond minor: det[ -32, -128; -50, -178 ].\n\n= (-32)(-178) - (-128)(-50 )\n\n= 5696 - 6400= -704.\n\nThird minor: det[ -32, -160; -50, -128 ].\n\n= (-32)(-128) - (-160)(-50 )\n\n= 4096 - 8000= -3904.\n\nNow, plug into the determinant:\n\ndet= -41*(12096) -9*(-704) + (-9)*(-3904 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-41*12096= -41*12096. Let's compute 40*12096=483,840. 1*12096=12,096. So, 483,840 +12,096=495,936. So, -41*12096= -495,936.\n\n-9*(-704)=6336.\n\n-9*(-3904)=35,136.\n\nSo, det= -495,936 +6,336 +35,136.\n\nCompute:\n\n-495,936 +6,336= -489,600.\n\n-489,600 +35,136= -454,464.\n\nSo, det(M)= -454,464.\n\nThus, the minor determinant is -454,464.\n\nSo, the original determinant D= -1 * (-454,464 )=454,464.\n\nTherefore, 288 V\u00b2=454,464.\n\nThus, V\u00b2=454,464 /288.\n\nCompute 454,464 \u00f7288.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16: 454,464 \u00f716=28,404; 288 \u00f716=18.\n\nSo, 28,404 /18=1,578.\n\nSo, V\u00b2=1,578.\n\nThus, V=\u221a1,578.\n\nSimplify \u221a1,578.\n\nFactor 1,578: divide by 2=789. 789 \u00f73=263. 263 is a prime.\n\nSo, 1,578=2*3*263.\n\nThus, \u221a1,578=\u221a(2*3*263 ). Since 263 is prime, no square factors.\n\nSo, V=\u221a(2*3*263 )=\u221a1578.\n\nWait, but earlier steps: 454,464 \u00f7288=1,578.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, V=\u221a1578.\n\nWait, but 1578= 2*3*263. So, it can't be simplified further.\n\nSo, V=\u221a1578.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I was trying the coordinates approach, I had V=2\u221a21 d3.\n\nSo, if V=\u221a1578, then d3=\u221a1578/(2\u221a21 )=\u221a(1578/42 )=\u221a(789/21 ).\n\nWait, 789 \u00f721=37.571... Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nBut anyway, I have V=\u221a1578.\n\nBut let me check the calculation because 454,464 \u00f7288=1,578.\n\nBut 288*1,578=288*(1,500 +78)=288*1,500=432,000; 288*78=22,464. So, 432,000 +22,464=454,464. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, V=\u221a1578.\n\nNow, the inradius r=3V/S.\n\nWe have S=24\u221a21.\n\nSo,\n\nr=3*\u221a1578 / (24\u221a21 )= (3/24)*\u221a1578 /\u221a21= (1/8)*\u221a(1578/21 ).\n\nSimplify 1578/21.\n\nDivide 1578 by 21:\n\n21*75=1,575. 1578-1,575=3. So, 1578/21=75 +3/21=75 +1/7=75.142857...\n\nBut as a fraction, 1578/21= (1578 \u00f73)/(21 \u00f73)=526/7.\n\nSo, \u221a(526/7 )=\u221a(526)/\u221a7.\n\nBut 526=2*263, and 263 is prime. So, \u221a526 is simplified.\n\nThus,\n\nr= (1/8)*\u221a(526/7 )=\u221a526/(8\u221a7 ).\n\nRationalize denominator:\n\nr=\u221a526 *\u221a7 / (8*7 )=\u221a(526*7 ) /56.\n\nCompute 526*7=3,682.\n\nSo, r=\u221a3682 /56.\n\nBut 3,682 factors: 3,682 \u00f72=1,841. 1,841 \u00f77=263. So, 3,682=2*7*263.\n\nSo, \u221a3682=\u221a(2*7*263 ). No square factors, so it's simplified.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought S=24\u221a21. Is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nEach face has area 6\u221a21, and there are 4 faces, so S=24\u221a21. Correct.\n\nAnd V=\u221a1578. So, r=3V/S=3\u221a1578/(24\u221a21 )=\u221a1578/(8\u221a21 ).\n\nBut 1578= 2*3*263. 21=3*7.\n\nSo, \u221a1578/\u221a21=\u221a(1578/21 )=\u221a(75.142857...)=\u221a(75 +1/7 ).\n\nBut 1578/21=75.142857=75 +1/7=526/7.\n\nWait, 75*7=525, so 525+1=526. So, 526/7.\n\nThus, \u221a(526/7 ).\n\nSo, r=\u221a(526/7 ) /8=\u221a526 / (8\u221a7 ).\n\nRationalize:\n\nr=\u221a526 *\u221a7 / (8*7 )=\u221a(526*7 ) /56=\u221a3682 /56.\n\nBut 3682=2*7*263, which can't be simplified further.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the distance can be written as m\u221an /p, where n is square-free.\n\nSo, r=\u221a3682 /56.\n\nBut 3682=2*7*263, all primes, so square-free.\n\nThus, m=1, n=3682, p=56.\n\nWait, but 3682 and 56: do they have common factors?\n\n56=8*7.\n\n3682 \u00f77=526, which is exact because 7*526=3,682.\n\nSo, 3682=7*526.\n\nSo, \u221a3682=\u221a(7*526 ). 526=2*263, which is square-free.\n\nSo, \u221a3682=\u221a(7*2*263 )=\u221a14*263.\n\nBut 14=2*7, so \u221a3682=\u221a(2*7*263 ).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, earlier I had V=\u221a1578, which is \u221a(2*3*263 ).\n\nThen, r=3V/S=3\u221a(2*3*263 )/(24\u221a21 )= (3\u221a(2*3*263 )) / (24\u221a(3*7 ))= (3\u221a(2*3*263 )) / (24\u221a3\u221a7 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\nCancel 3 in numerator and denominator: 3/24=1/8.\n\nCancel \u221a3: \u221a(2*3*263 )/\u221a3=\u221a2 *\u221a263.\n\nThus,\n\nr= (\u221a2 *\u221a263 ) / (8\u221a7 )=\u221a(2*263 )/(8\u221a7 )=\u221a526/(8\u221a7 ).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a7:\n\nr=\u221a(526*7 )/(8*7 )=\u221a3682 /56.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, r=\u221a3682 /56.\n\nBut 3682=2*7*263. So, n=3682 is square-free? Wait, 3682 is divisible by 2, but 2 is square-free. 7 is square-free, 263 is square-free. So, yes, n=3682 is square-free.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"n is not divisible by the square of any prime,\" which is correct for 3682.\n\nSo, the distance is r=\u221a3682 /56.\n\nBut 3682=2*7*263. So, can't be simplified further.\n\nSo, m=1, n=3682, p=56.\n\nBut wait, 56 and 1 are relatively prime, yes.\n\nSo, m +n +p=1 +3682 +56= 1 +3682=3683; 3683 +56=3739.\n\nWait, but that seems like a very large number, 3739. That seems unlikely for an Olympiad problem. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me double-check the Cayley-Menger determinant calculation.\n\nEarlier, I found that the determinant D=454,464.\n\nThen, 288 V\u00b2=454,464 => V\u00b2=454,464 /288= 1,578.\n\nThus, V=\u221a1578.\n\nBut 1578=2*3*263.\n\nBut when I computed the determinant of the minor, I got -454,464, so D=454,464.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the minor determinant.\n\nLet me recompute the 3x3 determinant.\n\nThe minor matrix after row operations was:\n\n| -41   9    -9  |\n| -32 -160 -128 |\n| -50 -128 -178 |\n\nCompute its determinant.\n\nI did cofactor expansion along the first row:\n\n-41 * det[ -160, -128; -128, -178 ] -9 * det[ -32, -128; -50, -178 ] + (-9)* det[ -32, -160; -50, -128 ].\n\nFirst minor: det[ -160, -128; -128, -178 ].\n\n= (-160)(-178) - (-128)(-128 )=28,480 -16,384=12,096.\n\nSecond minor: det[ -32, -128; -50, -178 ].\n\n= (-32)(-178) - (-128)(-50 )=5,696 -6,400= -704.\n\nThird minor: det[ -32, -160; -50, -128 ].\n\n= (-32)(-128) - (-160)(-50 )=4,096 -8,000= -3,904.\n\nThus, determinant= (-41)(12,096) + (-9)(-704) + (-9)(-3,904).\n\nWait, no: the cofactor expansion is:\n\n= (-41)(12,096) -9*(-704) + (-9)*(-3,904 )\n\nSo,\n\n= -495,936 +6,336 +35,136.\n\nWait,  -495,936 +6,336= -489,600.\n\nThen, -489,600 +35,136= -454,464.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the minor determinant is -454,464, so D= -1*(-454,464 )=454,464.\n\nThus, 288 V\u00b2=454,464 => V\u00b2=1,578.\n\nSo, V=\u221a1578.\n\nHmm, so that seems correct.\n\nThen, r=3V/S=3\u221a1578/(24\u221a21 )=\u221a1578/(8\u221a21 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\u221a1578/\u221a21=\u221a(1578/21 )=\u221a75.142857=\u221a(75 +1/7 )=\u221a(526/7 ).\n\nSo, r=\u221a(526/7 ) /8=\u221a526/(8\u221a7 )=\u221a(526*7 )/(8*7 )=\u221a3682 /56.\n\nHmm, so it's correct.\n\nBut 3682 is a large number, but perhaps that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, 526 is 2*263, and 263 is a prime, so yeah, 526 is square-free.\n\nSo, n=3682, which is 2*7*263, which is square-free.\n\nSo, the answer is r=\u221a3682 /56, so m=1, n=3682, p=56.\n\nThus, m +n +p=1 +3682 +56=3739.\n\nBut that seems too big. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the determinant.\n\nWait, let me check the Cayley-Menger determinant again.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0  41  80   89  |\n| 1  41   0  89   80  |\n| 1  80  89    0   41  |\n| 1  89  80   41    0  |\n\nI expanded along the first column after subtracting Row1 from Rows2,3,4.\n\nThe minor determinant was:\n\n|1   1    1     1   |\n|41 -41   9    -9   |\n|80 48  -80   -48   |\n|89 39  -39   -89   |\n\nWhich after row operations became:\n\n|1   1    1     1   |\n|41 -41   9    -9   |\n|0  -32 -160  -128  |\n|0  -50 -128  -178  |\n\nThen, expanding along the first column gave the minor determinant as the 3x3 determinant:\n\n| -41   9    -9  |\n| -32 -160 -128 |\n| -50 -128 -178 |\n\nWhich computed to -454,464.\n\nThus, D= -1*(-454,464 )=454,464.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.\n\nWait, the determinant is computed as (-1)^(i+j) * minor for each element.\n\nBut when expanding along the first column, the cofactor for element (1,0) is (-1)^(1+0)*M10, where M10 is the minor.\n\nSince (1,0) is the second row, first column, the cofactor is (-1)^(1+0)*M10= (-1)*M10.\n\nWait, in my calculation earlier, I thought D= -1 * minor, but perhaps I had an error in the sign.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nWhen expanding along the first column, the determinant is sum_{i=0}^{4} (-1)^{i+0} * M_{i,0} * det(minor).\n\nBut in our case, after row operations, the first column has 0s except for the first element (0,0).\n\nWait, no, after row operations, the first column is:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nWait, no, no, I think I messed up the row operations.\n\nWait, no, initially, after subtracting Row1 from Rows2,3,4, the first column became:\n\nRow0:0\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nSo, when expanding along the first column, only the element at (1,0) is non-zero, which is 1.\n\nThus, the determinant D=1 * (-1)^{1+0} * det(minor).\n\nWhich is D= (-1)^1 * det(minor)= -det(minor).\n\nEarlier, I thought D= -1 * minor, but actually, it's -det(minor).\n\nWait, in the previous calculation, I had D= -1 * (-454,464 )=454,464.\n\nBut if D= -det(minor)= -(-454,464 )=454,464.\n\nSo, that part was correct.\n\nThus, 288 V\u00b2=454,464 => V\u00b2=1,578 => V=\u221a1578.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nThus, r=3V/S=3\u221a1578/(24\u221a21 )=\u221a1578/(8\u221a21 )=\u221a(1578/21 ) /8=\u221a75.142857 /8=\u221a(526/7 ) /8=\u221a526/(8\u221a7 )=\u221a3682 /56.\n\nSo, the answer is \u221a3682 /56, which is m\u221an /p where m=1, n=3682, p=56.\n\nThus, m +n +p=1 +3682 +56=3739.\n\nBut that seems very large, so I'm a bit unsure. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the surface area S is incorrect.\n\nEarlier, I computed each face area as 6\u221a21, so S=24\u221a21.\n\nBut let me double-check the face area.\n\nUsing Heron's formula for a triangle with sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nCompute s=(\u221a41 +\u221a80 +\u221a89 )/2.\n\nBut Heron's formula is \u221a[s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c)].\n\nAlternatively, I used another formula earlier and got the area as 6\u221a21.\n\nWait, let me recompute that.\n\nI used the formula:\n\nArea= (1/4)\u221a(4a\u00b2b\u00b2 - (c\u00b2 -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 )\u00b2 )\n\nWith a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nCompute 4a\u00b2b\u00b2=4*41*80=4*3280=13120.\n\nc\u00b2 -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2=89 -41 -80= -32.\n\nSo, (c\u00b2 -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 )\u00b2=1024.\n\nThus, Area= (1/4)\u221a(13120 -1024 )=(1/4)\u221a12096.\n\n\u221a12096=\u221a(16*756)=4\u221a756.\n\nSo, Area= (1/4)*4\u221a756=\u221a756.\n\nBut 756=36*21, so \u221a756=6\u221a21.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, each face area is 6\u221a21, so S=24\u221a21.\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct, and the answer is 3739.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume using another method.\n\nWait, another approach: Since all edges are known, perhaps the volume can be computed using the formula for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal.\n\nI found a resource that says that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal (AB=CD=a, AC=BD=b, AD=BC=c), the volume is V= sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2 ) ) / ( 6\u221a2 ).\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nWait, I think the formula might be similar to the formula for a rhombic tetrahedron.\n\nWait, let me check.\n\nWait, according to some references, for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, the volume can be computed using the formula:\n\nV = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / ( 6\u221a2 )\n\nBut I need to confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the same as the formula for the volume of a parallelepiped, but adjusted for tetrahedron.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nWait, in the case where all opposite edges are equal, the volume can be computed using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / ( 6\u221a2 )\n\nSo, let me plug in the values.\n\nHere, a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 -c\u00b2=41 +80 -89=32.\n\na\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -b\u00b2=41 +89 -80=50.\n\nb\u00b2 +c\u00b2 -a\u00b2=80 +89 -41=128.\n\nSo,\n\nV= sqrt(32 *50 *128 ) / (6\u221a2 )\n\nCompute 32*50=1600; 1600*128=204,800.\n\nSo,\n\nV= sqrt(204,800 ) / (6\u221a2 )= sqrt(204800 )/(6\u221a2 ).\n\nCompute sqrt(204800 )=sqrt(2048 *100 )=10*sqrt(2048 ).\n\nBut 2048=1024*2=32\u00b2*2. So, sqrt(2048 )=32\u221a2.\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(204800 )=10*32\u221a2=320\u221a2.\n\nThus,\n\nV=320\u221a2 / (6\u221a2 )=320/6=160/3.\n\nSo, V=160/3.\n\nWait, that's a different result than before. So, which one is correct?\n\nEarlier, via Cayley-Menger determinant, I got V=\u221a1578\u224839.72.\n\nBut 160/3\u224853.333.\n\nThese are different. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, the formula I used: V= sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / ( 6\u221a2 )\n\nBut wait, I think that formula is for a specific type of tetrahedron, maybe when all faces are congruent, which is the case here.\n\nWait, but in this case, the formula gives V=160/3\u224853.333.\n\nBut via Cayley-Menger determinant, I got V=\u221a1578\u224839.72.\n\nThese are conflicting results, so I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, let me recompute the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nWait, when I computed the determinant D, I got 454,464, leading to V=\u221a1578.\n\nBut according to the formula, V=160/3.\n\nThus, 160/3 squared is 25,600/9\u22482,844.444.\n\nBut via determinant, V\u00b2=1,578\u22481,578.\n\nSo, these are different.\n\nHence, I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, let me try to compute the volume using the formula for the given edge lengths.\n\nGiven AB=CD=\u221a41, AC=BD=\u221a80, BC=AD=\u221a89.\n\nUsing the formula for the volume of such a tetrahedron.\n\nI found a formula online that says:\n\nIf a tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, then its volume is V= (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / (6\u221a2 )\n\nSo, plugging in a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 -c\u00b2=41 +80 -89=32.\n\na\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -b\u00b2=41 +89 -80=50.\n\nb\u00b2 +c\u00b2 -a\u00b2=80 +89 -41=128.\n\nSo,\n\nV= sqrt(32 *50 *128 ) / (6\u221a2 )= sqrt(204,800 )/(6\u221a2 )= 452.548 / (8.485 )\u224853.333.\n\nWhich is 160/3.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nThus, I must have made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant calculation.\n\nWait, let me check the Cayley-Menger determinant again.\n\nThe determinant I computed was 454,464, leading to V=\u221a1578.\n\nBut according to the formula, it should be V=160/3.\n\nSo, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the determinant.\n\nWait, the determinant was:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0  41  80   89  |\n| 1  41   0  89   80  |\n| 1  80  89    0   41  |\n| 1  89  80   41    0  |\n\nI performed row operations: subtracting Row1 from Rows2,3,4.\n\nWhich resulted in:\n\nRow0:0,1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow2:0,41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow3:0,80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow4:0,89,39,-39,-89\n\nThen, expanding along the first column, which had 0s except for Row1.\n\nThus, D= (-1)^{1+0} * M10, where M10 is the minor.\n\nSo, D= -det(Minor).\n\nThe minor was:\n\nRow0:1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow2:80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow3:89,39,-39,-89\n\nThen, I performed row operations on this minor matrix:\n\nSubtract 41*Row0 from Row1: Row1 becomes Row1 -41*Row0.\n\nSimilarly, subtract 80*Row0 from Row2, and 89*Row0 from Row3.\n\nWait, no, I think I subtracted multiples of Row0 from Rows2 and 3 to eliminate the first column.\n\nBut perhaps I should have done it differently.\n\nWait, to eliminate the first column in the minor matrix, which is:\n\nRow0:1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow2:80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow3:89,39,-39,-89\n\nSo, to eliminate the first column, subtract 41*Row0 from Row1, 80*Row0 from Row2, 89*Row0 from Row3.\n\nThus,\n\nRow1_new=Row1 -41*Row0: 41-41=0, -41-41= -82, 9-41= -32, -9-41= -50.\n\nRow2_new=Row2 -80*Row0:80-80=0,48-80= -32, -80-80= -160, -48-80= -128.\n\nRow3_new=Row3 -89*Row0:89-89=0,39-89= -50, -39-89= -128, -89-89= -178.\n\nSo, the minor matrix becomes:\n\nRow0:1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:0,-82,-32,-50\n\nRow2:0,-32,-160,-128\n\nRow3:0,-50,-128,-178\n\nNow, the determinant is the same as the original, since we're performing row operations.\n\nNow, expanding along the first column, which has 1 and the rest 0s.\n\nThus, determinant=1 * det(minor) where minor is the 3x3 matrix:\n\nRow1:-82,-32,-50\n\nRow2:-32,-160,-128\n\nRow3:-50,-128,-178\n\nSo, compute this determinant.\n\nCompute using cofactor expansion along Row1:\n\n-82 * det[ -160,-128; -128,-178 ] - (-32)*det[ -32,-128; -50,-178 ] + (-50)*det[ -32,-160; -50,-128 ]\n\nCompute each minor:\n\nFirst minor: det[ -160,-128; -128,-178 ]= (-160)(-178) - (-128)(-128 )=28,480 -16,384=12,096.\n\nSecond minor: det[ -32,-128; -50,-178 ]= (-32)(-178) - (-128)(-50 )=5,696 -6,400= -704.\n\nThird minor: det[ -32,-160; -50,-128 ]= (-32)(-128) - (-160)(-50 )=4,096 -8,000= -3,904.\n\nThus, determinant= (-82)(12,096) - (-32)(-704) + (-50)(-3,904 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-82 *12,096= Let's compute 80*12,096=967,680; 2*12,096=24,192.

The tetrahedron has opposite edges equal: \\(AB = CD = \\sqrt{41}\\), \\(AC = BD = \\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(BC = AD = \\sqrt{89}\\). The inradius \\(r\\) can be calculated using the formula \\(r = \\frac{3V}{S}\\), where \\(V\\) is the volume and \\(S\\) is the total surface area of the tetrahedron.\n\nFirst, we calculate the volume \\(V\\) using a known formula for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{\\sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)}}{6\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(a = \\sqrt{41}\\), \\(b = \\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(c = \\sqrt{89}\\):\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 - c^2 = 41 + 80 - 89 = 32\n\\]\n\\[\na^2 + c^2 - b^2 = 41 + 89 - 80 = 50\n\\]\n\\[\nb^2 + c^2 - a^2 = 80 + 89 - 41 = 128\n\\]\n\\[\nV = \\frac{\\sqrt{32 \\times 50 \\times 128}}{6\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{204800}}{6\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{452.548}{6\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{160}{3}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total surface area \\(S\\). Each face is a triangle with sides \\(\\sqrt{41}\\), \\(\\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{89}\\). Using Heron's formula, the area of one face is \\(6\\sqrt{21}\\). Since there are four congruent faces:\n\\[\nS = 4 \\times 6\\sqrt{21} = 24\\sqrt{21}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the inradius \\(r\\):\n\\[\nr = \\frac{3V}{S} = \\frac{3 \\times \\frac{160}{3}}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{160}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20}{3\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}\n\\]\nThus, \\(m = 20\\), \\(n = 21\\), and \\(p = 63\\). Therefore, \\(m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{104}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron that's equidistant from all four faces, and I need to find that distance in a specific form and then compute m + n + p where the distance is expressed as m\u221an / p.\n\nHmm, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.\n\nTo find the inradius, I think I can use the formula: volume divided by the sum of the areas of the faces, all multiplied by 3. Wait, let me recall. For a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius r is r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces). So, I need to find both the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area.\n\nBut first, how do I find the volume? I remember that for a tetrahedron, if I know the edge lengths, I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant. That's a formula that gives the volume based on the lengths of all the edges. Let me try to remember the formula.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:\n\nVolume V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the matrix:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   a\u00b2   b\u00b2   c\u00b2 |\n| 1  a\u00b2   0    d\u00b2   e\u00b2 |\n| 1  b\u00b2  d\u00b2    0    f\u00b2 |\n| 1  c\u00b2  e\u00b2   f\u00b2    0  |\n\nSo, I need to plug in all the edge lengths into this matrix and compute the determinant.\n\nLet me list all the edge lengths again to make sure I have them right:\n\nAB = sqrt(41) => a = sqrt(41)\nAC = sqrt(80) => b = sqrt(80)\nAD = sqrt(89) => c = sqrt(89)\nBC = sqrt(89) => d = sqrt(89)\nBD = sqrt(80) => e = sqrt(80)\nCD = sqrt(41) => f = sqrt(41)\n\nWait, that seems a bit symmetric. AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD. So, this tetrahedron is \"isohedral\" in some way? Maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron.\n\nBut regardless, I'll proceed with the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nFirst, compute all the squares of the edge lengths:\n\na\u00b2 = (sqrt(41))\u00b2 = 41\nb\u00b2 = (sqrt(80))\u00b2 = 80\nc\u00b2 = (sqrt(89))\u00b2 = 89\nd\u00b2 = (sqrt(89))\u00b2 = 89\ne\u00b2 = (sqrt(80))\u00b2 = 80\nf\u00b2 = (sqrt(41))\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo, the Cayley-Menger matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm placing them correctly. The matrix is a 5x5 matrix. The first row and column are 0,1,1,1,1. Then, the next rows go as:\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, AB\u00b2, AC\u00b2, AD\u00b2 = 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\nRow 2: 1, AB\u00b2, 0, BC\u00b2, BD\u00b2 = 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\nRow 3: 1, AC\u00b2, BC\u00b2, 0, CD\u00b2 = 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\nRow 4: 1, AD\u00b2, BD\u00b2, CD\u00b2, 0 = 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, now I need to compute the determinant of this matrix. But computing a 5x5 determinant manually is going to be a bit tedious. Maybe I can look for symmetries or patterns that can simplify the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can observe that the tetrahedron is symmetrical, which might make the volume calculation easier.\n\nWait, considering the edge lengths, AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD, this suggests that the tetrahedron is \"equifacial\" or that all its faces are congruent. But wait, no, because the edge lengths aren't the same. Let me check:\n\nEach face is a triangle with edge lengths:\n\nFor face ABC: AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80)\nFor face ABD: AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89)\nFor face ACD: AC = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41), AD = sqrt(89)\nFor face BCD: BC = sqrt(89), CD = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80)\n\nSo, all four faces have the same set of edge lengths: sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So each face is congruent. Therefore, the tetrahedron is isohedral, meaning that all its faces are congruent and it's symmetrical.\n\nSo, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Therefore, all faces are congruent triangles. So, the area of each face is the same. That might help in calculating the total surface area.\n\nBut first, let me try to compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nSo, the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   41   80   89 |\n| 1  41    0   89   80 |\n| 1  80   89    0   41 |\n| 1  89   80   41    0  |\n\nCalculating this determinant is going to be a bit of work. Let me consider expanding it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a way to simplify the matrix before computing the determinant. Let me see if the matrix has any special properties, like symmetry.\n\nLooking at the matrix, it's symmetric. That might help. Also, perhaps subtracting rows or columns to create zeros.\n\nLet me denote the rows as R0, R1, R2, R3, R4.\n\nSince all the rows after R0 have 1 as their first element, perhaps I can subtract R1 from R2, R3, R4 to create zeros in the first column beyond R0.\n\nWait, R0 is [0,1,1,1,1], and the other rows are [1,0,41,80,89], etc. So, maybe subtract R1 from R2, R3, R4.\n\nWait, let me try that:\n\nCompute R2' = R2 - R1: [1-1, 41-0, 0-41, 89-80, 80-89] = [0, 41, -41, 9, -9]\n\nSimilarly, R3' = R3 - R1: [1-1, 80-0, 89-41, 0-80, 41-89] = [0, 80, 48, -80, -48]\n\nR4' = R4 - R1: [1-1, 89-0, 80-41, 41-80, 0-89] = [0, 89, 39, -39, -89]\n\nBut wait, that might not be the best approach because the first element of R2, R3, R4 becomes zero, which is helpful for creating an upper triangular matrix, but I'm not sure if this is the most efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe perform row operations to simplify the determinant. Another approach is to note that the determinant is symmetric, so perhaps we can compute it using known properties or by finding a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the determinant using expansion by minors. Let's try expanding along the first row.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n0 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor)\n\nBut since the first element is 0, that term drops out. So, the determinant is:\n\n-1 * det(M1) + 1 * det(M2) - 1 * det(M3) + 1 * det(M4)\n\nWhere M1 is the minor for element (0,1), M2 for (0,2), etc.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the determinant is the same as the determinant of a matrix with rows and columns permuted, due to symmetry.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the determinant numerically. Let me write down all the elements:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nSo, the determinant is:\n\n| 0  1   1    1    1  |\n| 1  0  41   80   89 |\n| 1 41   0   89   80 |\n| 1 80  89    0   41 |\n| 1 89  80   41    0 |\n\nComputing this determinant... Maybe I can use the fact that the determinant is the same as the determinant of a matrix where each row is shifted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute this using a calculator or software, but since I'm doing this by hand, let's try another approach.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute the determinant using the properties of the matrix. Since all the off-diagonal elements in the lower 4x4 matrix are symmetric, perhaps there's a way to factor it or find eigenvalues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can subtract rows from each other to create zeros.\n\nWait, perhaps subtract row 1 from row 2, row 3, row 4.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nRow2' = Row2 - Row1:\n\n[1-1, 41-0, 0-41, 89-80, 80-89] => [0,41,-41,9,-9]\n\nRow3' = Row3 - Row1:\n\n[1-1,80-0,89-41,0-80,41-89] => [0,80,48,-80,-48]\n\nRow4' = Row4 - Row1:\n\n[1-1,89-0,80-41,41-80,0-89] => [0,89,39,-39,-89]\n\nSo now, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow0: 0,1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow2':0,41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow3':0,80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow4':0,89,39,-39,-89\n\nNow, the first column is [0,1,0,0,0], which might make expansion easier.\n\nExpanding along the first column, the determinant is:\n\n0 * minor - 1 * det(minor) + 0 + 0 + 0\n\nSo, the determinant is -1 times the determinant of the minor matrix obtained by removing row0 and column1.\n\nThe minor matrix is:\n\nRow1': [0,41,80,89]\n\nRow2'': [41,-41,9,-9]\n\nRow3'': [80,48,-80,-48]\n\nRow4'': [89,39,-39,-89]\n\nWait, no, wait. The minor after removing row0 and column1 would be a 4x4 matrix:\n\nRow1: [0,41,80,89]\n\nRow2': [41,-41,9,-9]\n\nRow3': [80,48,-80,-48]\n\nRow4': [89,39,-39,-89]\n\nWait, no. The minor is actually the submatrix obtained by removing row0 and column1, so the remaining rows are rows 1,2,3,4 and columns 0,2,3,4.\n\nWait, no, the original matrix after row operations is:\n\nRow0: 0,1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow2':0,41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow3':0,80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow4':0,89,39,-39,-89\n\nSo, the minor after removing row0 (index 0) and column1 (index 1) is the 4x4 matrix:\n\nRow1: [1,41,80,89]\n\nRow2': [0,-41,9,-9]\n\nRow3': [0,48,-80,-48]\n\nRow4': [0,39,-39,-89]\n\nWait, no. Because in the 5x5 matrix, after removing row0 and column1, the indices shift. So the minor is:\n\nRows 1,2,3,4 and columns 0,2,3,4.\n\nSo the minor is:\n\nRow1: [1,41,80,89]\n\nRow2': [0,-41,9,-9]\n\nRow3': [0,48,-80,-48]\n\nRow4': [0,39,-39,-89]\n\nSo, the minor matrix is:\n\n1  41   80   89\n\n0 -41    9   -9\n\n0  48  -80  -48\n\n0  39  -39  -89\n\nNow, this is a 4x4 matrix. Let's compute its determinant.\n\nComputing a 4x4 determinant can be done by expanding along the first column, which has three zeros, making it easier.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n1 * det(minor) + 0 + 0 + 0 = det(minor), where the minor is the 3x3 matrix:\n\n-41   9   -9\n\n48  -80  -48\n\n39  -39  -89\n\nSo, now I need to compute the determinant of this 3x3 matrix.\n\nLet me write it down:\n\n| -41   9    -9  |\n| 48  -80   -48 |\n| 39  -39  -89 |\n\nCompute this determinant.\n\nUsing the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. I'll do cofactor expansion along the first row.\n\ndet = -41 * det( (-80, -48), (-39, -89) ) - 9 * det( (48, -48), (39, -89) ) + (-9) * det( (48, -80), (39, -39) )\n\nCompute each minor:\n\nFirst minor: det( (-80, -48), (-39, -89) ) = (-80)(-89) - (-48)(-39) = 7120 - 1872 = 5248\n\nSecond minor: det( (48, -48), (39, -89) ) = (48)(-89) - (-48)(39) = -4272 + 1872 = -2400\n\nThird minor: det( (48, -80), (39, -39) ) = (48)(-39) - (-80)(39) = -1872 + 3120 = 1248\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\ndet = (-41)(5248) - 9*(-2400) + (-9)(1248)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-41 * 5248 = let's compute 40*5248 = 209,920; 1*5248=5,248; so total 209,920 + 5,248 = 215,168; but since it's -41, it's -215,168\n\n-9*(-2400) = +21,600\n\n-9*1248 = -11,232\n\nSo, total det = (-215,168) + 21,600 -11,232\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n-215,168 + 21,600 = -193,568\n\n-193,568 -11,232 = -204,800\n\nSo, the determinant of the 3x3 minor is -204,800.\n\nTherefore, the determinant of the 4x4 minor is 1 * (-204,800) = -204,800.\n\nBut wait, the determinant of the 4x4 matrix is -204,800.\n\nBut remember, the determinant of the original 5x5 Cayley-Menger matrix is -1 times this determinant, because we had:\n\ndet(CM) = -1 * det(4x4 minor) = -1 * (-204,800) = 204,800.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, earlier we had that the determinant of the 5x5 matrix is equal to -1 * det(4x4 minor), which we computed as -204,800.\n\nSo, det(CM) = -1 * (-204,800) = 204,800.\n\nWait, but the formula for the volume is sqrt( |CM| / 288 ). So, |CM| is 204,800.\n\nSo, V = sqrt(204800 / 288) = sqrt( (204800 \u00f7 288) )\n\nSimplify 204800 / 288:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16: 204800 \u00f716=12800; 288 \u00f716=18.\n\nSo, 12800 / 18 = 6400 / 9.\n\nSo, V = sqrt(6400 / 9) = 80 / 3.\n\nSo, the volume is 80/3.\n\nWait, that seems a bit too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, let me confirm the calculation:\n\n204800 / 288.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16: 204800 \u00f716=12800; 288 \u00f716=18.\n\n12800 \u00f718 = 711.111... which is 6400/9 \u2248711.111...\n\nSo, sqrt(6400/9) = 80/3, yes. So, volume V = 80/3.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the total surface area S. Since all four faces are congruent triangles, each with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), I can compute the area of one face and multiply by four.\n\nSo, let's compute the area of triangle ABC with sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nI can use Heron's formula for this. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle is sqrt( s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) ), where s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter s:\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2 = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.\n\nBut computing this directly might be messy. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the area in terms of the sides and the cosine law.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the area using vectors or coordinates. But since I know all three sides, Heron's formula is the way to go.\n\nWait, but maybe I can compute the area squared to avoid dealing with square roots.\n\nLet me denote:\n\na = sqrt(41) => a\u00b2 = 41\n\nb = sqrt(80) => b\u00b2 =80\n\nc = sqrt(89) => c\u00b2=89\n\nCompute s = (a + b + c)/2\n\nBut s is going to be messy, so perhaps compute s\u00b2:\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2\n\ns\u00b2 = (a + b + c)\u00b2 /4 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc)/4\n\nBut that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the area using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nWhich is another form of Heron's formula.\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\nArea\u00b2 = (1/16) * (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nTerm1: a + b + c = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)\n\nTerm2: -a + b + c = -sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)\n\nTerm3: a - b + c = sqrt(41) - sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)\n\nTerm4: a + b - c = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) - sqrt(89)\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe instead, use the cosine law to find one angle and then compute the area as (1/2)ab sin(theta).\n\nLet me try that.\n\nCompute one angle using cosine law. Let's compute angle opposite to side c, which is sqrt(89). So, angle C is opposite to c.\n\ncos C = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2) / (2ab)\n\nPlugging in:\n\na\u00b2 =41, b\u00b2=80, c\u00b2=89\n\ncos C = (41 +80 -89)/(2*sqrt(41)*sqrt(80)) = (32)/(2*sqrt(3280)) )\n\nSimplify sqrt(3280):\n\n3280 factors: 16 * 205, since 16*205=3280. So sqrt(3280) = 4*sqrt(205)\n\nSo, cos C = 32/(2*4*sqrt(205)) ) = 32/(8*sqrt(205)) ) = 4/sqrt(205)\n\nSo, sin C = sqrt(1 - (16/205)) = sqrt( (205 -16)/205 ) = sqrt(189/205) = sqrt(189)/sqrt(205)\n\nSimplify sqrt(189): 189 = 9*21 = 9*3*7, so sqrt(189)=3*sqrt(21)\n\nThus, sin C = 3*sqrt(21)/sqrt(205)\n\nSo, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*a*b*sin C = (1/2)*sqrt(41)*sqrt(80)*(3*sqrt(21)/sqrt(205))\n\nCompute this:\n\n(1/2) * sqrt(41 * 80) * (3 sqrt(21)/sqrt(205))\n\nSimplify sqrt(41 *80) = sqrt(3280) = 4*sqrt(205) as before.\n\nSo, area = (1/2) * 4*sqrt(205) * (3 sqrt(21)/sqrt(205)) )\n\nThe sqrt(205) cancels out:\n\n(1/2)*4*3*sqrt(21) = (1/2)*12*sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, the area of one face is 6 sqrt(21). Therefore, the total surface area S is 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21)\n\nWait, that seems manageable. Let me double-check the steps.\n\nFirst, using cosine law:\n\ncos C = (41 +80 -89)/(2*sqrt(41)*sqrt(80)) = (32)/(2*sqrt(3280)) )\n\nsqrt(3280) = sqrt(16*205) = 4 sqrt(205)\n\nSo, cos C = 32 / (2 *4 sqrt(205)) ) = 32/(8 sqrt(205)) ) = 4 / sqrt(205)\n\nThen sin C = sqrt(1 - (16/205)) = sqrt(189/205) = 3 sqrt(21)/sqrt(205)\n\nArea = (1/2)*sqrt(41)*sqrt(80)*sin C\n\n= (1/2)*sqrt(3280)* (3 sqrt(21)/sqrt(205))\n\nsqrt(3280) = 4 sqrt(205)\n\nSo, (1/2)*4 sqrt(205) * (3 sqrt(21)/sqrt(205)) = (1/2)*4*3*sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21)\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, each face has area 6 sqrt(21), so total surface area S = 4 *6 sqrt(21)=24 sqrt(21)\n\nTherefore, the inradius r = 3V / S = 3*(80/3) / (24 sqrt(21)) ) = (80) / (24 sqrt(21)) )\n\nSimplify 80/24: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 10/3\n\nSo, r = (10/3)/sqrt(21) = 10/(3 sqrt(21)) )\n\nRationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):\n\nr = (10 sqrt(21))/(3*21) ) = (10 sqrt(21))/63\n\nSo, the distance is 10 sqrt(21)/63\n\nSimplify: 10 and 63 are coprime (since 10 factors are 2,5; 63 is 7*3^2). 21 is 3*7, which is square-free.\n\nSo, the form is m\u221an / p, where m=10, n=21, p=63. So, m +n +p=10+21+63=94.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the formula for inradius. I think I might have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the formula for the inradius of a tetrahedron is r = 3V / S, where S is the total surface area.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*(80/3) =80, and 80 divided by 24 sqrt(21) is 10/(3 sqrt(21)), which is 10 sqrt(21)/63.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, the distance is 10\u221a21 /63, so m=10, n=21, p=63. Therefore, m + n + p = 10 + 21 + 63 =94.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron that's equidistant from all four faces, and I need to find that distance in a specific form and then compute m + n + p where the distance is expressed as m\u221an / p.\n\nHmm, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.\n\nTo find the inradius, I think I can use the formula: volume divided by the sum of the areas of the faces, all multiplied by 3. Wait, let me recall. For a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius r is r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces). So, I need to find both the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area.\n\nBut first, how do I find the volume? I remember that for a tetrahedron, if I know the edge lengths, I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant. That's a formula that gives the volume based on the lengths of all the edges. Let me try to remember the formula.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:\n\nVolume V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the matrix:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   a\u00b2   b\u00b2   c\u00b2 |\n| 1  a\u00b2   0    d\u00b2   e\u00b2 |\n| 1  b\u00b2  d\u00b2    0    f\u00b2 |\n| 1  c\u00b2  e\u00b2   f\u00b2    0  |\n\nSo, I need to plug in all the edge lengths into this matrix and compute the determinant.\n\nLet me list all the edge lengths again to make sure I have them right:\n\nAB = sqrt(41) => a = sqrt(41)\nAC = sqrt(80) => b = sqrt(80)\nAD = sqrt(89) => c = sqrt(89)\nBC = sqrt(89) => d = sqrt(89)\nBD = sqrt(80) => e = sqrt(80)\nCD = sqrt(41) => f = sqrt(41)\n\nWait, that seems a bit symmetric. AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD. So, this tetrahedron is \"isohedral\" in some way? Maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron.\n\nBut regardless, I'll proceed with the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nFirst, compute all the squares of the edge lengths:\n\na\u00b2 = (sqrt(41))\u00b2 = 41\nb\u00b2 = (sqrt(80))\u00b2 = 80\nc\u00b2 = (sqrt(89))\u00b2 = 89\nd\u00b2 = (sqrt(89))\u00b2 = 89\ne\u00b2 = (sqrt(80))\u00b2 = 80\nf\u00b2 = (sqrt(41))\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo, the Cayley-Menger matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm placing them correctly. The matrix is a 5x5 matrix. The first row and column are 0,1,1,1,1. Then, the next rows go as:\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, AB\u00b2, AC\u00b2, AD\u00b2 = 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\nRow 2: 1, AB\u00b2, 0, BC\u00b2, BD\u00b2 = 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\nRow 3: 1, AC\u00b2, BC\u00b2, 0, CD\u00b2 = 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\nRow 4: 1, AD\u00b2, BD\u00b2, CD\u00b2, 0 = 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, now I need to compute the determinant of this matrix. But computing a 5x5 determinant manually is going to be a bit tedious. Maybe I can look for symmetries or patterns that can simplify the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can observe that the tetrahedron is symmetrical, which might make the volume calculation easier.\n\nWait, considering the edge lengths, AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD, this suggests that the tetrahedron is \"equifacial\" or that all its faces are congruent. But wait, no, because the edge lengths aren't the same. Let me check:\n\nEach face is a triangle with edge lengths:\n\nFor face ABC: AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80)\nFor face ABD: AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89)\nFor face ACD: AC = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41), AD = sqrt(89)\nFor face BCD: BC = sqrt(89), CD = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80)\n\nSo, all four faces have the same set of edge lengths: sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So each face is congruent. Therefore, the tetrahedron is isohedral, meaning that all its faces are congruent and it's symmetrical.\n\nSo, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Therefore, all faces are congruent triangles. So, the area of each face is the same. That might help in calculating the total surface area.\n\nBut first, let me try to compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nSo, the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   41   80   89 |\n| 1  41    0   89   80 |\n| 1  80   89    0   41 |\n| 1  89   80   41    0  |\n\nCalculating this determinant is going to be a bit of work. Let me consider expanding it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a way to simplify the matrix before computing the determinant. Let me see if the matrix has any special properties, like symmetry.\n\nLooking at the matrix, it's symmetric. That might help. Also, perhaps subtracting rows or columns to create zeros.\n\nLet me denote the rows as R0, R1, R2, R3, R4.\n\nSince all the rows after R0 have 1 as their first element, perhaps I can subtract R1 from R2, R3, R4 to create zeros in the first column beyond R0.\n\nWait, R0 is [0,1,1,1,1], and the other rows are [1,0,41,80,89], etc. So, maybe subtract R1 from R2, R3, R4.\n\nWait, let me try that:\n\nCompute R2' = R2 - R1: [1-1, 41-0, 0-41, 89-80, 80-89] = [0, 41, -41, 9, -9]\n\nSimilarly, R3' = R3 - R1: [1-1, 80-0, 89-41, 0-80, 41-89] = [0, 80, 48, -80, -48]\n\nR4' = R4 - R1: [1-1, 89-0, 80-41, 41-80, 0-89] = [0, 89, 39, -39, -89]\n\nBut wait, that might not be the best approach because the first element of R2, R3, R4 becomes zero, which is helpful for creating an upper triangular matrix, but I'm not sure if this is the most efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe perform row operations to simplify the determinant. Another approach is to note that the determinant is symmetric, so perhaps we can compute it using known properties or by finding a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the determinant using expansion by minors. Let's try expanding along the first row.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n0 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor)\n\nBut since the first element is 0, that term drops out. So, the determinant is:\n\n-1 * det(M1) + 1 * det(M2) - 1 * det(M3) + 1 * det(M4)\n\nWhere M1 is the minor for element (0,1), M2 for (0,2), etc.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the determinant is the same as the determinant of a matrix with rows and columns permuted, due to symmetry.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the determinant numerically. Let me write down all the elements:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nSo, the determinant is:\n\n| 0  1   1    1    1  |\n| 1  0  41   80   89 |\n| 1 41   0   89   80 |\n| 1 80  89    0   41 |\n| 1 89  80   41    0 |\n\nComputing this determinant... Maybe I can use the fact that the determinant is the same as the determinant of a matrix where each row is shifted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute this using a calculator or software, but since I'm doing this by hand, let's try another approach.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute the determinant using the properties of the matrix. Since all the off-diagonal elements in the lower 4x4 matrix are symmetric, perhaps there's a way to factor it or find eigenvalues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can subtract rows from each other to create zeros.\n\nWait, perhaps subtract row 1 from row 2, row 3, row 4.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nRow2' = Row2 - Row1:\n\n[1-1, 41-0, 0-41, 89-80, 80-89] => [0,41,-41,9,-9]\n\nRow3' = Row3 - Row1:\n\n[1-1,80-0,89-41,0-80,41-89] => [0,80,48,-80,-48]\n\nRow4' = Row4 - Row1:\n\n[1-1,89-0,80-41,41-80,0-89] => [0,89,39,-39,-89]\n\nSo now, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow0: 0,1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow2':0,41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow3':0,80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow4':0,89,39,-39,-89\n\nNow, the first column is [0,1,0,0,0], which might make expansion easier.\n\nExpanding along the first column, the determinant is:\n\n0 * minor - 1 * det(minor) + 0 + 0 + 0\n\nSo, the determinant is -1 times the determinant of the minor matrix obtained by removing row0 and column1.\n\nThe minor matrix is:\n\nRow1': [0,41,80,89]\n\nRow2'': [41,-41,9,-9]\n\nRow3'': [80,48,-80,-48]\n\nRow4'': [89,39,-39,-89]\n\nWait, no, wait. The minor after removing row0 and column1 would be a 4x4 matrix:\n\nRow1: [0,41,80,89]\n\nRow2': [41,-41,9,-9]\n\nRow3': [80,48,-80,-48]\n\nRow4': [89,39,-39,-89]\n\nWait, no. The minor is actually the submatrix obtained by removing row0 and column1, so the remaining rows are rows 1,2,3,4 and columns 0,2,3,4.\n\nWait, no, the original matrix after row operations is:\n\nRow0: 0,1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow2':0,41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow3':0,80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow4':0,89,39,-39,-89\n\nSo, the minor after removing row0 (index 0) and column1 (index 1) is the 4x4 matrix:\n\nRow1: [1,41,80,89]\n\nRow2': [0,-41,9,-9]\n\nRow3': [0,48,-80,-48]\n\nRow4': [0,39,-39,-89]\n\nWait, no. Because in the 5x5 matrix, after removing row0 and column1, the indices shift. So the minor is:\n\nRows 1,2,3,4 and columns 0,2,3,4.\n\nSo the minor is:\n\nRow1: [1,41,80,89]\n\nRow2': [0,-41,9,-9]\n\nRow3': [0,48,-80,-48]\n\nRow4': [0,39,-39,-89]\n\nSo, the minor matrix is:\n\n1  41   80   89\n\n0 -41    9   -9\n\n0  48  -80  -48\n\n0  39  -39  -89\n\nNow, this is a 4x4 matrix. Let's compute its determinant.\n\nComputing a 4x4 determinant can be done by expanding along the first column, which has three zeros, making it easier.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n1 * det(minor) + 0 + 0 + 0 = det(minor), where the minor is the 3x3 matrix:\n\n-41   9   -9\n\n48  -80  -48\n\n39  -39  -89\n\nSo, now I need to compute the determinant of this 3x3 matrix.\n\nLet me write it down:\n\n| -41   9    -9  |\n| 48  -80   -48 |\n| 39  -39  -89 |\n\nCompute this determinant.\n\nUsing the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. I'll do cofactor expansion along the first row.\n\ndet = -41 * det( (-80, -48), (-39, -89) ) - 9 * det( (48, -48), (39, -89) ) + (-9) * det( (48, -80), (39, -39) )\n\nCompute each minor:\n\nFirst minor: det( (-80, -48), (-39, -89) ) = (-80)(-89) - (-48)(-39) = 7120 - 1872 = 5248\n\nSecond minor: det( (48, -48), (39, -89) ) = (48)(-89) - (-48)(39) = -4272 + 1872 = -2400\n\nThird minor: det( (48, -80), (39, -39) ) = (48)(-39) - (-80)(39) = -1872 + 3120 = 1248\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\ndet = (-41)(5248) - 9*(-2400) + (-9)(1248)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-41 * 5248 = let's compute 40*5248 = 209,920; 1*5248=5,248; so total 209,920 + 5,248 = 215,168; but since it's -41, it's -215,168\n\n-9*(-2400) = +21,600\n\n-9*1248 = -11,232\n\nSo, total det = (-215,168) + 21,600 -11,232\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n-215,168 + 21,600 = -193,568\n\n-193,568 -11,232 = -204,800\n\nSo, the determinant of the 3x3 minor is -204,800.\n\nTherefore, the determinant of the 4x4 minor is 1 * (-204,800) = -204,800.\n\nBut wait, the determinant of the 4x4 matrix is -204,800.\n\nBut remember, the determinant of the original 5x5 Cayley-Menger matrix is -1 times this determinant, because we had:\n\ndet(CM) = -1 * det(4x4 minor) = -1 * (-204,800) = 204,800.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, earlier we had that the determinant of the 5x5 matrix is equal to -1 * det(4x4 minor), which we computed as -204,800.\n\nSo, det(CM) = -1 * (-204,800) = 204,800.\n\nWait, but the formula for the volume is sqrt( |CM| / 288 ). So, |CM| is 204,800.\n\nSo, V = sqrt(204800 / 288) = sqrt( (204800 \u00f7 288) )\n\nSimplify 204800 / 288:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16: 204800 \u00f716=12800; 288 \u00f716=18.\n\nSo, 12800 / 18 = 6400 / 9.\n\nSo, V = sqrt(6400 / 9) = 80 / 3.\n\nSo, the volume is 80/3.\n\nWait, that seems a bit too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, let me confirm the calculation:\n\n204800 / 288.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16: 204800 \u00f716=12800; 288 \u00f716=18.\n\n12800 \u00f718 = 711.111... which is 6400/9 \u2248711.111...\n\nSo, sqrt(6400/9) = 80/3, yes. So, volume V = 80/3.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the total surface area S. Since all four faces are congruent triangles, each with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), I can compute the area of one face and multiply by four.\n\nSo, let's compute the area of triangle ABC with sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nI can use Heron's formula for this. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle is sqrt( s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) ), where s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter s:\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2 = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.\n\nBut computing this directly might be messy. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the area in terms of the sides and the cosine law.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the area using vectors or coordinates. But since I know all three sides, Heron's formula is the way to go.\n\nWait, but maybe I can compute the area squared to avoid dealing with square roots.\n\nLet me denote:\n\na = sqrt(41) => a\u00b2 = 41\n\nb = sqrt(80) => b\u00b2 =80\n\nc = sqrt(89) => c\u00b2=89\n\nCompute s = (a + b + c)/2\n\nBut s is going to be messy, so perhaps compute s\u00b2:\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2\n\ns\u00b2 = (a + b + c)\u00b2 /4 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc)/4\n\nBut that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the area using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nWhich is another form of Heron's formula.\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\nArea\u00b2 = (1/16) * (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nTerm1: a + b + c = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)\n\nTerm2: -a + b + c = -sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)\n\nTerm3: a - b + c = sqrt(41) - sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)\n\nTerm4: a + b - c = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) - sqrt(89)\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe instead, use the cosine law to find one angle and then compute the area as (1/2)ab sin(theta).\n\nLet me try that.\n\nCompute one angle using cosine law. Let's compute angle opposite to side c, which is sqrt(89). So, angle C is opposite to c.\n\ncos C = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2) / (2ab)\n\nPlugging in:\n\na\u00b2 =41, b\u00b2=80, c\u00b2=89\n\ncos C = (41 +80 -89)/(2*sqrt(41)*sqrt(80)) = (32)/(2*sqrt(3280)) )\n\nSimplify sqrt(3280):\n\n3280 factors: 16 * 205, since 16*205=3280. So sqrt(3280) = 4*sqrt(205)\n\nSo, cos C = 32/(2*4*sqrt(205)) ) = 32/(8*sqrt(205)) ) = 4/sqrt(205)\n\nSo, sin C = sqrt(1 - (16/205)) = sqrt( (205 -16)/205 ) = sqrt(189/205) = sqrt(189)/sqrt(205)\n\nSimplify sqrt(189): 189 = 9*21 = 9*3*7, so sqrt(189)=3*sqrt(21)\n\nThus, sin C = 3*sqrt(21)/sqrt(205)\n\nSo, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*a*b*sin C = (1/2)*sqrt(41)*sqrt(80)*(3*sqrt(21)/sqrt(205))\n\nCompute this:\n\n(1/2) * sqrt(41 * 80) * (3 sqrt(21)/sqrt(205))\n\nSimplify sqrt(41 *80) = sqrt(3280) = 4*sqrt(205) as before.\n\nSo, area = (1/2) * 4*sqrt(205) * (3 sqrt(21)/sqrt(205)) )\n\nThe sqrt(205) cancels out:\n\n(1/2)*4*3*sqrt(21) = (1/2)*12*sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, the area of one face is 6 sqrt(21). Therefore, the total surface area S is 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21)\n\nWait, that seems manageable. Let me double-check the steps.\n\nFirst, using cosine law:\n\ncos C = (41 +80 -89)/(2*sqrt(41)*sqrt(80)) = (32)/(2*sqrt(3280)) )\n\nsqrt(3280) = sqrt(16*205) = 4 sqrt(205)\n\nSo, cos C = 32 / (2 *4 sqrt(205)) ) = 32/(8 sqrt(205)) ) = 4 / sqrt(205)\n\nThen sin C = sqrt(1 - (16/205)) = sqrt(189/205) = 3 sqrt(21)/sqrt(205)\n\nArea = (1/2)*sqrt(41)*sqrt(80)*sin C\n\n= (1/2)*sqrt(3280)* (3 sqrt(21)/sqrt(205))\n\nsqrt(3280) = 4 sqrt(205)\n\nSo, (1/2)*4 sqrt(205) * (3 sqrt(21)/sqrt(205)) = (1/2)*4*3*sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21)\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, each face has area 6 sqrt(21), so total surface area S = 4 *6 sqrt(21)=24 sqrt(21)\n\nTherefore, the inradius r = 3V / S = 3*(80/3) / (24 sqrt(21)) ) = (80) / (24 sqrt(21)) )\n\nSimplify 80/24: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 10/3\n\nSo, r = (10/3)/sqrt(21) = 10/(3 sqrt(21)) )\n\nRationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):\n\nr = (10 sqrt(21))/(3*21) ) = (10 sqrt(21))/63\n\nSo, the distance is 10 sqrt(21)/63\n\nSimplify: 10 and 63 are coprime (since 10 factors are 2,5; 63 is 7*3^2). 21 is 3*7, which is square-free.\n\nSo, the form is m\u221an / p, where m=10, n=21, p=63. So, m +n +p=10+21+63=94.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the formula for inradius. I think I might have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the formula for the inradius of a tetrahedron is r = 3V / S, where S is the total surface area.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*(80/3) =80, and 80 divided by 24 sqrt(21) is 10/(3 sqrt(21)), which is 10 sqrt(21)/63.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, the distance is 10\u221a21 /63, so m=10, n=21, p=63. Therefore, m + n + p = 10 + 21 + 63 =94.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first recognize that the given tetrahedron is isohedral, meaning all its faces are congruent triangles with sides \\( \\sqrt{41} \\), \\( \\sqrt{80} \\), and \\( \\sqrt{89} \\). We aim to find the inradius, which is the distance from the incenter to each face.\n\n### Step 1: Compute the Volume using Cayley-Menger Determinant\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths \\( AB = \\sqrt{41} \\), \\( AC = \\sqrt{80} \\), \\( AD = \\sqrt{89} \\), \\( BC = \\sqrt{89} \\), \\( BD = \\sqrt{80} \\), and \\( CD = \\sqrt{41} \\) is used to find the volume \\( V \\).\n\nThe determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix is calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{det} = 204800\n\\]\nThe volume \\( V \\) is then:\n\\[\nV = \\sqrt{\\frac{|\\text{det}|}{288}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{204800}{288}} = \\frac{80}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Total Surface Area\nEach face is a triangle with sides \\( \\sqrt{41} \\), \\( \\sqrt{80} \\), and \\( \\sqrt{89} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron that's equidistant from all four faces, and I need to find that distance in the form m\u221an / p, then compute m + n + p.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.\n\nTo find the inradius, I recall that the formula for the inradius (r) of a tetrahedron is given by the volume (V) divided by the surface area (S), but wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, actually, for a tetrahedron, the inradius is equal to 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. Because in 3D, the volume is (1/3)*base_area*height, so the inradius is like the height corresponding to the total surface area as the base. So, r = 3V / S, where S is the sum of the areas of all four faces.\n\nSo, my plan is: find the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area. Then, compute r = 3V / S.\n\nBut to find the volume, I might need the edge lengths, which I have, but the given edges are in pairs, which suggests the tetrahedron is \"isohedral\" or at least has some symmetry. Maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal.\n\nWait, the edge lengths are AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So, it's a kind of edge-symmetric tetrahedron. I think such tetrahedrons are called \"equifacial\" or maybe \"isohedral,\" but I'm not entirely sure. Anyway, the point is, maybe I can use some properties of such tetrahedrons to find the volume.\n\nI remember that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it's called a disphenoid. So, this is a disphenoid. Disphenoids have some nice properties, like all faces are congruent triangles, but wait, in this case, the edges are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), so each face must be a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Wait, no, each face is a triangle, but each face is not necessarily congruent.\n\nWait, let's think again. In a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal, but the faces are congruent triangles. So, if that's the case, then all four faces are congruent. So, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, each face has the same area, which might help.\n\nSo, if all four faces are congruent, then the surface area S is 4 times the area of one face.\n\nSo, first, let's compute the area of one face. Let's pick triangle ABC, with sides AB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), BC = sqrt(89).\n\nWait, hold on: AB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), BC = sqrt(89). So, triangle ABC has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Let me check if this is a right triangle.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(41))\u00b2 + (sqrt(80))\u00b2 = 41 + 80 = 121. And (sqrt(89))\u00b2 is 89. So, 121 \u2260 89, so it's not a right triangle. Hmm.\n\nSo, I need to compute the area of this triangle. I can use Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2. But that looks messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, perhaps we can find the volume using some formula specific to disphenoids. I recall that for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nVolume = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )) / (6\u221a2)\n\nWait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me think.\n\nWait, I think there's a formula for the volume of a disphenoid in terms of its edge lengths. Since all opposite edges are equal, the volume can be calculated with a formula involving the edge lengths. Maybe I can find it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to compute the volume.\n\nYes, that might be a good approach. Let me try that.\n\nLet me assign coordinates to the vertices such that calculations are easier.\n\nSince opposite edges are equal, perhaps I can place the points symmetrically.\n\nLet me assume point A is at (x, y, z), point B at (-x, -y, z), point C at (-x, y, -z), and point D at (x, -y, -z). This kind of symmetry might make the opposite edges equal.\n\nWait, let's test this. The distance between A and B would be sqrt[(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0^2] = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Similarly, the distance between C and D would be sqrt[(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2] = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). But in our problem, AB = CD = sqrt(41). So, 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(41) => sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(41)/2.\n\nSimilarly, the distance between A and C: Let's compute the coordinates. A is (x, y, z), C is (-x, y, -z). The distance AC is sqrt[(2x)^2 + 0^2 + (2z)^2] = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80). So, sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80)/2 = (4\u221a5)/2 = 2\u221a5.\n\nSimilarly, the distance between B and D: B is (-x, -y, z), D is (x, -y, -z). The distance BD is sqrt[(2x)^2 + 0^2 + (2z)^2] = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80). So, that's consistent.\n\nSimilarly, the distance between A and D: A is (x, y, z), D is (x, -y, -z). Distance AD is sqrt[0^2 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2] = 2*sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89). So, sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89)/2.\n\nSimilarly, the distance between B and C: B is (-x, -y, z), C is (-x, y, -z). Distance BC is sqrt[0^2 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2] = 2*sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89), which is consistent.\n\nSo, now, I have three equations:\n\n1. sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(41)/2 \u2192 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\n2. sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80)/2 \u2192 x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 80/4 = 20.\n\n3. sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89)/2 \u2192 y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo, now, I can write these equations:\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nEquation 2: x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20.\n\nEquation 3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nI can solve for x\u00b2, y\u00b2, z\u00b2.\n\nSubtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\n(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4 \u2192 z\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 20 - 10.25 = 9.75 = 39/4.\n\nFrom Equation 3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nz\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 39/4.\n\nz\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nAdding these two equations: 2z\u00b2 = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32 \u2192 z\u00b2 = 16 \u2192 z = 4 or z = -4.\n\nSubtracting the equations: 2y\u00b2 = (89 - 39)/4 = 50/4 = 25/2 \u2192 y\u00b2 = 25/4 \u2192 y = 5/2 or y = -5/2.\n\nFrom Equation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 41/4 - 25/4 = 16/4 = 4 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 4 \u2192 x = 2 or x = -2.\n\nSo, we have x = \u00b12, y = \u00b15/2, z = \u00b14.\n\nBut since we're dealing with coordinates, the signs can be chosen to place the points in space. Since we've already set up the coordinates symmetrically, the actual signs won't affect the volume, which is a positive quantity.\n\nSo, let's take x = 2, y = 5/2, z = 4.\n\nSo, the coordinates are:\n\nA: (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB: (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC: (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nD: (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nWait, let me confirm that these coordinates satisfy the distances.\n\nCompute AB: distance between A(2,5/2,4) and B(-2,-5/2,4).\n\nDifference in x: 4, y: -5, z: 0.\n\nSo, distance AB: sqrt(4\u00b2 + (-5)^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(16 + 25) = sqrt(41). Correct.\n\nAC: distance between A(2,5/2,4) and C(-2,5/2,-4).\n\nx difference: 4, y: 0, z: -8.\n\nDistance: sqrt(4\u00b2 + 0 + (-8)^2) = sqrt(16 + 64) = sqrt(80). Correct.\n\nAD: distance between A(2,5/2,4) and D(2,-5/2,-4).\n\nx: 0, y: -5, z: -8.\n\nDistance: sqrt(0 + (-5)^2 + (-8)^2) = sqrt(25 + 64) = sqrt(89). Correct.\n\nSo, the coordinates are correct.\n\nNow, to find the volume of the tetrahedron. The volume can be found using the scalar triple product formula.\n\nGiven four points A, B, C, D, the volume is | (AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD)) | / 6.\n\nLet me compute vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nVector AB = B - A = (-2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, 4 - 4) = (-4, -5, 0).\n\nVector AC = C - A = (-2 - 2, 5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (-4, 0, -8).\n\nVector AD = D - A = (2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (0, -5, -8).\n\nNow, compute the cross product AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nCross product formula:\n\ni (0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) - j (-4*(-8) - 0*(-8)) + k (-4*(-5) - 0*0)\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni: (0 - 40) = -40\nj: -(32 - 0) = -32\nk: (20 - 0) = 20\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nNow, compute the dot product AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD):\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\nCross product = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nDot product: (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320.\n\nSo, the volume V = |320| / 6 = 320 / 6 = 160 / 3.\n\nWait, hold on. Volume is 1/6 times the absolute value of the scalar triple product. So, yes, 320 / 6 = 160/3.\n\nSo, V = 160/3.\n\nNow, compute the total surface area S. Since all four faces are congruent triangles, each with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), and we just need to compute the area of one face and multiply by four.\n\nSo, let's compute the area of triangle ABC, which has sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nWe can use Heron's formula. First, compute the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\ns = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can use another formula for the area.\n\nWait, given that in a disphenoid, the faces are congruent, but I don't think that directly gives the area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the area using vectors.\n\nWait, since I have coordinates for the points, maybe I can compute the area of triangle ABC using vectors.\n\nPoints A(2,5/2,4), B(-2,-5/2,4), C(-2,5/2,-4).\n\nVectors AB = (-4, -5, 0)\nVectors AC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nThe area is (1/2) the magnitude of AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nCompute AB \u00d7 AC:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCross product:\n\ni: (-5*(-8) - 0*0) = 40\nj: -( (-4*(-8) - 0*(-4)) ) = -(32 - 0) = -32\nk: (-4*0 - (-5)*(-4)) = 0 - 20 = -20\n\nSo, AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024).\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7 = 2^4 * 3^3 * 7.\n\nSo, sqrt(3024) = sqrt(16 * 9 * 9 * 3 * 7) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(9 * 3 * 7) \u2192 Wait, no.\n\nWait, sqrt(2^4 * 3^3 *7) = 2^2 * 3 * sqrt(3*7) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12\u221a21.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nsqrt(3024) = sqrt(576 * 5.25) Hmm, maybe another approach.\n\nWait, 3024 divided by 144 is 21. So, sqrt(144 * 21) = 12\u221a21.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, |AB \u00d7 AC| = 12\u221a21.\n\nSo, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12\u221a21 = 6\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, each face has area 6\u221a21, and the total surface area S = 4 * 6\u221a21 = 24\u221a21.\n\nNow, going back to the inradius formula: r = 3V / S.\n\nWe have V = 160/3, S = 24\u221a21.\n\nSo, r = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = (160) / (24\u221a21) = (160)/(24\u221a21).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8: 20 / (3\u221a21).\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21:\n\n20\u221a21 / (3*21) = 20\u221a21 / 63.\n\nSo, r = (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nSimplify 20 and 63: 20 and 63 are coprime since 20 factors into 2^2*5 and 63 is 7*3^2. So, no common factors.\n\nSo, m = 20, n = 21, p = 63.\n\nWait, but wait a second, is 20 and 63 relatively prime? Yes, because 20 is 2^2*5 and 63 is 3^2*7; no common prime factors.\n\nAlso, n=21, which factors into 3*7, neither of which is a square, so 21 is square-free.\n\nSo, the distance is 20\u221a21 / 63, so m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when I computed the cross product AB \u00d7 AC, I got (40, -32, -20), which has a magnitude of sqrt(40^2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024). Which is 12\u221a21, as I had before.\n\nSo, the area of each face is 6\u221a21, so total surface area is 24\u221a21. Then, V is 160/3.\n\nSo, r = 3V / S = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160 / (24\u221a21) = (20)/(3\u221a21) = 20\u221a21 / 63.\n\nYes, so that seems correct.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63. Adding them: 20+21+63=104.\n\nWait, but I just realized, in the initial problem statement, the edges AB=CD= sqrt(41), AC=BD= sqrt(80), BC=AD= sqrt(89). So, the edges are in pairs, but in my coordinate system, the distances come out correctly, so that part is fine.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check the volume calculation.\n\nI used the scalar triple product: AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD). AB is (-4, -5, 0), AC is (-4, 0, -8), AD is (0, -5, -8).\n\nFirst, compute AC \u00d7 AD:\n\ni component: (0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) = 0 - 40 = -40.\n\nj component: - [(-4)*(-8) - 0*(-8)] = - [32 - 0] = -32.\n\nk component: [(-4)*(-5) - 0*0] = 20 - 0 = 20.\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD is (-40, -32, 20).\n\nThen, AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD) = (-4)(-40) + (-5)(-32) + (0)(20) = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320.\n\nSo, the volume is |320| / 6 = 320/6 = 160/3. That's correct.\n\nSo, everything seems to check out. So, the inradius is 20\u221a21 / 63, so m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{104}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron that's equidistant from all four faces, and I need to find that distance in the form m\u221an / p, then compute m + n + p.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.\n\nTo find the inradius, I recall that the formula for the inradius (r) of a tetrahedron is given by the volume (V) divided by the surface area (S), but wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, actually, for a tetrahedron, the inradius is equal to 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. Because in 3D, the volume is (1/3)*base_area*height, so the inradius is like the height corresponding to the total surface area as the base. So, r = 3V / S, where S is the sum of the areas of all four faces.\n\nSo, my plan is: find the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area. Then, compute r = 3V / S.\n\nBut to find the volume, I might need the edge lengths, which I have, but the given edges are in pairs, which suggests the tetrahedron is \"isohedral\" or at least has some symmetry. Maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal.\n\nWait, the edge lengths are AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So, it's a kind of edge-symmetric tetrahedron. I think such tetrahedrons are called \"equifacial\" or maybe \"isohedral,\" but I'm not entirely sure. Anyway, the point is, maybe I can use some properties of such tetrahedrons to find the volume.\n\nI remember that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it's called a disphenoid. So, this is a disphenoid. Disphenoids have some nice properties, like all faces are congruent triangles, but wait, in this case, the edges are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), so each face must be a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Wait, no, each face is a triangle, but each face is not necessarily congruent.\n\nWait, let's think again. In a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal, but the faces are congruent triangles. So, if that's the case, then all four faces are congruent. So, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, each face has the same area, which might help.\n\nSo, if all four faces are congruent, then the surface area S is 4 times the area of one face.\n\nSo, first, let's compute the area of one face. Let's pick triangle ABC, with sides AB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), BC = sqrt(89).\n\nWait, hold on: AB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), BC = sqrt(89). So, triangle ABC has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Let me check if this is a right triangle.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(41))\u00b2 + (sqrt(80))\u00b2 = 41 + 80 = 121. And (sqrt(89))\u00b2 is 89. So, 121 \u2260 89, so it's not a right triangle. Hmm.\n\nSo, I need to compute the area of this triangle. I can use Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2. But that looks messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, perhaps we can find the volume using some formula specific to disphenoids. I recall that for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nVolume = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )) / (6\u221a2)\n\nWait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me think.\n\nWait, I think there's a formula for the volume of a disphenoid in terms of its edge lengths. Since all opposite edges are equal, the volume can be calculated with a formula involving the edge lengths. Maybe I can find it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to compute the volume.\n\nYes, that might be a good approach. Let me try that.\n\nLet me assign coordinates to the vertices such that calculations are easier.\n\nSince opposite edges are equal, perhaps I can place the points symmetrically.\n\nLet me assume point A is at (x, y, z), point B at (-x, -y, z), point C at (-x, y, -z), and point D at (x, -y, -z). This kind of symmetry might make the opposite edges equal.\n\nWait, let's test this. The distance between A and B would be sqrt[(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0^2] = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Similarly, the distance between C and D would be sqrt[(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2] = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). But in our problem, AB = CD = sqrt(41). So, 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(41) => sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(41)/2.\n\nSimilarly, the distance between A and C: Let's compute the coordinates. A is (x, y, z), C is (-x, y, -z). The distance AC is sqrt[(2x)^2 + 0^2 + (2z)^2] = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80). So, sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80)/2 = (4\u221a5)/2 = 2\u221a5.\n\nSimilarly, the distance between B and D: B is (-x, -y, z), D is (x, -y, -z). The distance BD is sqrt[(2x)^2 + 0^2 + (2z)^2] = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80). So, that's consistent.\n\nSimilarly, the distance between A and D: A is (x, y, z), D is (x, -y, -z). Distance AD is sqrt[0^2 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2] = 2*sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89). So, sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89)/2.\n\nSimilarly, the distance between B and C: B is (-x, -y, z), C is (-x, y, -z). Distance BC is sqrt[0^2 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2] = 2*sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89), which is consistent.\n\nSo, now, I have three equations:\n\n1. sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(41)/2 \u2192 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\n2. sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(80)/2 \u2192 x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 80/4 = 20.\n\n3. sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(89)/2 \u2192 y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo, now, I can write these equations:\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nEquation 2: x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20.\n\nEquation 3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nI can solve for x\u00b2, y\u00b2, z\u00b2.\n\nSubtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\n(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4 \u2192 z\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 20 - 10.25 = 9.75 = 39/4.\n\nFrom Equation 3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nz\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 39/4.\n\nz\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nAdding these two equations: 2z\u00b2 = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32 \u2192 z\u00b2 = 16 \u2192 z = 4 or z = -4.\n\nSubtracting the equations: 2y\u00b2 = (89 - 39)/4 = 50/4 = 25/2 \u2192 y\u00b2 = 25/4 \u2192 y = 5/2 or y = -5/2.\n\nFrom Equation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 41/4 - 25/4 = 16/4 = 4 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 4 \u2192 x = 2 or x = -2.\n\nSo, we have x = \u00b12, y = \u00b15/2, z = \u00b14.\n\nBut since we're dealing with coordinates, the signs can be chosen to place the points in space. Since we've already set up the coordinates symmetrically, the actual signs won't affect the volume, which is a positive quantity.\n\nSo, let's take x = 2, y = 5/2, z = 4.\n\nSo, the coordinates are:\n\nA: (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB: (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC: (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nD: (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nWait, let me confirm that these coordinates satisfy the distances.\n\nCompute AB: distance between A(2,5/2,4) and B(-2,-5/2,4).\n\nDifference in x: 4, y: -5, z: 0.\n\nSo, distance AB: sqrt(4\u00b2 + (-5)^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(16 + 25) = sqrt(41). Correct.\n\nAC: distance between A(2,5/2,4) and C(-2,5/2,-4).\n\nx difference: 4, y: 0, z: -8.\n\nDistance: sqrt(4\u00b2 + 0 + (-8)^2) = sqrt(16 + 64) = sqrt(80). Correct.\n\nAD: distance between A(2,5/2,4) and D(2,-5/2,-4).\n\nx: 0, y: -5, z: -8.\n\nDistance: sqrt(0 + (-5)^2 + (-8)^2) = sqrt(25 + 64) = sqrt(89). Correct.\n\nSo, the coordinates are correct.\n\nNow, to find the volume of the tetrahedron. The volume can be found using the scalar triple product formula.\n\nGiven four points A, B, C, D, the volume is | (AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD)) | / 6.\n\nLet me compute vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nVector AB = B - A = (-2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, 4 - 4) = (-4, -5, 0).\n\nVector AC = C - A = (-2 - 2, 5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (-4, 0, -8).\n\nVector AD = D - A = (2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (0, -5, -8).\n\nNow, compute the cross product AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nCross product formula:\n\ni (0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) - j (-4*(-8) - 0*(-8)) + k (-4*(-5) - 0*0)\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni: (0 - 40) = -40\nj: -(32 - 0) = -32\nk: (20 - 0) = 20\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nNow, compute the dot product AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD):\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\nCross product = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nDot product: (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320.\n\nSo, the volume V = |320| / 6 = 320 / 6 = 160 / 3.\n\nWait, hold on. Volume is 1/6 times the absolute value of the scalar triple product. So, yes, 320 / 6 = 160/3.\n\nSo, V = 160/3.\n\nNow, compute the total surface area S. Since all four faces are congruent triangles, each with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), and we just need to compute the area of one face and multiply by four.\n\nSo, let's compute the area of triangle ABC, which has sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nWe can use Heron's formula. First, compute the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\ns = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can use another formula for the area.\n\nWait, given that in a disphenoid, the faces are congruent, but I don't think that directly gives the area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the area using vectors.\n\nWait, since I have coordinates for the points, maybe I can compute the area of triangle ABC using vectors.\n\nPoints A(2,5/2,4), B(-2,-5/2,4), C(-2,5/2,-4).\n\nVectors AB = (-4, -5, 0)\nVectors AC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nThe area is (1/2) the magnitude of AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nCompute AB \u00d7 AC:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCross product:\n\ni: (-5*(-8) - 0*0) = 40\nj: -( (-4*(-8) - 0*(-4)) ) = -(32 - 0) = -32\nk: (-4*0 - (-5)*(-4)) = 0 - 20 = -20\n\nSo, AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024).\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7 = 2^4 * 3^3 * 7.\n\nSo, sqrt(3024) = sqrt(16 * 9 * 9 * 3 * 7) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(9 * 3 * 7) \u2192 Wait, no.\n\nWait, sqrt(2^4 * 3^3 *7) = 2^2 * 3 * sqrt(3*7) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12\u221a21.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nsqrt(3024) = sqrt(576 * 5.25) Hmm, maybe another approach.\n\nWait, 3024 divided by 144 is 21. So, sqrt(144 * 21) = 12\u221a21.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, |AB \u00d7 AC| = 12\u221a21.\n\nSo, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12\u221a21 = 6\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, each face has area 6\u221a21, and the total surface area S = 4 * 6\u221a21 = 24\u221a21.\n\nNow, going back to the inradius formula: r = 3V / S.\n\nWe have V = 160/3, S = 24\u221a21.\n\nSo, r = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = (160) / (24\u221a21) = (160)/(24\u221a21).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8: 20 / (3\u221a21).\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21:\n\n20\u221a21 / (3*21) = 20\u221a21 / 63.\n\nSo, r = (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nSimplify 20 and 63: 20 and 63 are coprime since 20 factors into 2^2*5 and 63 is 7*3^2. So, no common factors.\n\nSo, m = 20, n = 21, p = 63.\n\nWait, but wait a second, is 20 and 63 relatively prime? Yes, because 20 is 2^2*5 and 63 is 3^2*7; no common prime factors.\n\nAlso, n=21, which factors into 3*7, neither of which is a square, so 21 is square-free.\n\nSo, the distance is 20\u221a21 / 63, so m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when I computed the cross product AB \u00d7 AC, I got (40, -32, -20), which has a magnitude of sqrt(40^2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024). Which is 12\u221a21, as I had before.\n\nSo, the area of each face is 6\u221a21, so total surface area is 24\u221a21. Then, V is 160/3.\n\nSo, r = 3V / S = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160 / (24\u221a21) = (20)/(3\u221a21) = 20\u221a21 / 63.\n\nYes, so that seems correct.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63. Adding them: 20+21+63=104.\n\nWait, but I just realized, in the initial problem statement, the edges AB=CD= sqrt(41), AC=BD= sqrt(80), BC=AD= sqrt(89). So, the edges are in pairs, but in my coordinate system, the distances come out correctly, so that part is fine.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check the volume calculation.\n\nI used the scalar triple product: AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD). AB is (-4, -5, 0), AC is (-4, 0, -8), AD is (0, -5, -8).\n\nFirst, compute AC \u00d7 AD:\n\ni component: (0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) = 0 - 40 = -40.\n\nj component: - [(-4)*(-8) - 0*(-8)] = - [32 - 0] = -32.\n\nk component: [(-4)*(-5) - 0*0] = 20 - 0 = 20.\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD is (-40, -32, 20).\n\nThen, AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD) = (-4)(-40) + (-5)(-32) + (0)(20) = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320.\n\nSo, the volume is |320| / 6 = 320/6 = 160/3. That's correct.\n\nSo, everything seems to check out. So, the inradius is 20\u221a21 / 63, so m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{104}\n\n\nGiven a tetrahedron \\(ABCD\\) with edge lengths \\(AB = CD = \\sqrt{41}\\), \\(AC = BD = \\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(BC = AD = \\sqrt{89}\\), we need to find the distance from the incenter \\(I\\) to each face, which is the inradius. \n\nFirst, we recognize that this tetrahedron is a disphenoid, meaning all faces are congruent triangles.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given with specific lengths: AB and CD are sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are equal. I need to find this distance, which can be written in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, and then find m + n + p.\n\nHmm, okay. First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is called the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.\n\nTo find the inradius, I think I need the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area. Wait, actually, in a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius is 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. Let me recall the formula: r = 3V / A, where V is the volume and A is the total surface area.\n\nSo, my plan is to calculate the volume V of tetrahedron ABCD and its total surface area A, then compute r = 3V / A.\n\nBut first, how do I find the volume of a tetrahedron when I know all the edge lengths? I remember that for a tetrahedron, if you know all six edge lengths, you can use the Cayley-Menger determinant. That might be the way to go.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   a\u00b2   b\u00b2   c\u00b2 |\n| 1  a\u00b2   0    d\u00b2   e\u00b2 |\n| 1  b\u00b2  d\u00b2    0    f\u00b2 |\n| 1  c\u00b2  e\u00b2   f\u00b2    0  |\n\nThe determinant of this 5x5 matrix is proportional to the volume squared. The formula is:\n\n288 * V\u00b2 = determinant of the above matrix.\n\nSo, I can compute this determinant, take the square root, and then divide by 288^(1/2) to get V.\n\nLet me list the edge lengths again:\n\nAB = sqrt(41), so a\u00b2 = 41\n\nAC = sqrt(80), so b\u00b2 = 80\n\nAD = sqrt(89), so c\u00b2 = 89\n\nBC = sqrt(89), so d\u00b2 = 89\n\nBD = sqrt(80), so e\u00b2 = 80\n\nCD = sqrt(41), so f\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo, plugging these into the Cayley-Menger determinant matrix:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, let me make sure I get the positions right. The matrix is 5x5, with the first row and column being [0,1,1,1,1] and the subsequent rows and columns being the squares of the edge lengths.\n\nWait, actually, the Cayley-Menger determinant is a 5x5 matrix where the first row is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1], the first column is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]^T, and the other entries are the squares of the distances between the points.\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\nCM = [\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n[1, 0, AB\u00b2, AC\u00b2, AD\u00b2],\n[1, AB\u00b2, 0, BC\u00b2, BD\u00b2],\n[1, AC\u00b2, BC\u00b2, 0, CD\u00b2],\n[1, AD\u00b2, BD\u00b2, CD\u00b2, 0]\n]\n\nSo, substituting the values:\n\nCM = [\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n[1, 0, 41, 80, 89],\n[1, 41, 0, 89, 80],\n[1, 80, 89, 0, 41],\n[1, 89, 80, 41, 0]\n]\n\nOkay, now I need to compute the determinant of this matrix.\n\nCalculating a 5x5 determinant is going to be a bit tedious, but maybe I can find a pattern or simplify it somehow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can notice that the tetrahedron is isohedral or something, but the edge lengths are all different, so probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the tetrahedron can be embedded in 3D space in a symmetric way, but I'm not sure. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the determinant step by step.\n\nBut before I dive into that, maybe I can consider that this tetrahedron has some symmetry because opposite edges are equal.\n\nAB = CD = sqrt(41)\n\nAC = BD = sqrt(80)\n\nAD = BC = sqrt(89)\n\nSo, it's a kind of symmetric tetrahedron, sometimes called a \"disphenoid.\" In a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal, and the tetrahedron is face-transitive. So, perhaps the volume can be calculated more easily.\n\nWait, I remember that for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )) / 8\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe that's for a different case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find coordinates for the vertices.\n\nYes, maybe assigning coordinates to the vertices could help. Since it's a disphenoid, maybe I can position it such that the midpoints of opposite edges are aligned along certain axes.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me place the tetrahedron so that the midpoints of AB and CD are at the origin, and the line connecting them is along the z-axis.\n\nWait, but maybe a better approach is to place the points symmetrically.\n\nAlternatively, let me place the points as follows:\n\nLet me denote the points as A, B, C, D.\n\nSince AB = CD, AC = BD, AD = BC, perhaps the tetrahedron is symmetric in some way.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system such that the coordinates are symmetric.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates.\n\nLet me set point A at (x, y, z), point B at (-x, -y, z), point C at (-x, y, -z), and point D at (x, -y, -z). This way, the coordinates are symmetric with respect to the origin.\n\nLet me see if this works.\n\nThen, the midpoint of AB would be at (0, 0, z), and the midpoint of CD would be at (0, 0, -z). Similarly, midpoints of AC and BD would be at other symmetric points.\n\nBut perhaps this symmetry will help in computing the edge lengths.\n\nLet me compute AB, AC, etc., in terms of x, y, z.\n\nCompute AB: distance between A and B.\n\nA is (x, y, z), B is (-x, -y, z). So,\n\nAB\u00b2 = (x - (-x))\u00b2 + (y - (-y))\u00b2 + (z - z)\u00b2 = (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 = 4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2.\n\nGiven AB\u00b2 = 41, so 4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2 = 41 \u2192 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nSimilarly, compute AC: distance between A (x, y, z) and C (-x, y, -z).\n\nAC\u00b2 = (x - (-x))\u00b2 + (y - y)^2 + (z - (-z))\u00b2 = (2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2 = 4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2.\n\nGiven AC\u00b2 = 80, so 4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2 = 80 \u2192 x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, compute AD: distance between A (x, y, z) and D (x, -y, -z).\n\nAD\u00b2 = (x - x)^2 + (y - (-y))^2 + (z - (-z))^2 = 0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 = 4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2.\n\nGiven AD\u00b2 = 89, so 4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2 = 89 \u2192 y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo now, I have three equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n\n2. x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\n\n3. y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nI can solve these equations to find x\u00b2, y\u00b2, z\u00b2.\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 3:\n\n(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = (89/4) - (41/4)\n\nz\u00b2 - x\u00b2 = (89 - 41)/4 = 48/4 = 12.\n\nSo, z\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 12.\n\nFrom equation 2: x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20.\n\nSubstitute z\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 12:\n\nx\u00b2 + (x\u00b2 + 12) = 20 \u2192 2x\u00b2 + 12 = 20 \u2192 2x\u00b2 = 8 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 4 \u2192 x = \u00b12.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 4.\n\nThen, from equation 2: x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20 \u2192 4 + z\u00b2 = 20 \u2192 z\u00b2 = 16 \u2192 z = \u00b14.\n\nFrom equation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4 \u2192 4 + y\u00b2 = 41/4 \u2192 y\u00b2 = 41/4 - 16/4 = 25/4 \u2192 y = \u00b15/2.\n\nSo, now, x = \u00b12, y = \u00b15/2, z = \u00b14.\n\nSo, the coordinates of the four points are:\n\nA: (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB: (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC: (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nD: (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nPoint A: (x, y, z) = (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nPoint B: (-x, -y, z) = (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nPoint C: (-x, y, -z) = (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nPoint D: (x, -y, -z) = (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nYes, that should satisfy the edge lengths.\n\nNow, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron.\n\nThe volume of a tetrahedron can be found using the scalar triple product formula:\n\nV = | (AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD)) | / 6\n\nBut wait, let me compute vectors AB, AC, AD, then find the scalar triple product.\n\nWait, but with the coordinates assigned, perhaps it's easier to use the determinant formula.\n\nAlternatively, since I have coordinates for all four points, I can compute the volume using the determinant.\n\nGiven four points A, B, C, D, the volume is |det(B - A, C - A, D - A)| / 6.\n\nSo, let's compute vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nWait, actually, vectors AB, AC, AD are from point A to points B, C, D.\n\nBut in the determinant formula, we need vectors from the same point, so vectors AB, AC, AD are from A to B, A to C, A to D.\n\nSo, let's compute vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nVector AB = B - A = (-2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, 4 - 4) = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nVector AC = C - A = (-2 - 2, 5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nVector AD = D - A = (2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (0, -5, -8)\n\nSo, the three vectors are:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nNow, the scalar triple product is AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD).\n\nFirst, compute the cross product AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nCross product AC \u00d7 AD is determinant:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k |\n|-4\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0-8|\n|0\u00a0\u00a0-5\u00a0\u00a0-8|\n\nCalculating:\n\ni*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)\n\nSimplify each component:\n\ni*(0 - 40) - j*(32 - 0) + k*(20 - 0)\n\nSo,\n\ni*(-40) - j*(32) + k*(20)\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nNow, compute AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD):\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nDot product with (-40, -32, 20):\n\n(-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320\n\nSo, the scalar triple product is 320.\n\nHence, the volume V is |320| / 6 = 320 / 6 = 160 / 3.\n\nWait, that seems a bit large. Let me check my calculations.\n\nWait, let me recompute the cross product.\n\nAC \u00d7 AD:\n\ni component: (0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) = 0 - 40 = -40\n\nj component: - [ (-4*(-8) - (-8)*0 ) ] = - [32 - 0] = -32\n\nk component: (-4*(-5) - 0*0 ) = 20 - 0 = 20\n\nSo, yes, AC \u00d7 AD is (-40, -32, 20).\n\nThen, AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD) is (-4)(-40) + (-5)(-32) + (0)(20) = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320.\n\nSo, yes, the volume is 320 / 6 = 160/3.\n\nSo, V = 160/3.\n\nWait, that's a positive number, which makes sense. So, volume is 160/3.\n\nNow, moving on to the surface area.\n\nThe total surface area A is the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces.\n\nEach face is a triangle, so I can compute the area of each triangle using Heron's formula.\n\nBut let me first find the lengths of all edges again, just to make sure.\n\nGiven:\n\nAB = sqrt(41)\n\nAC = sqrt(80)\n\nAD = sqrt(89)\n\nBC = sqrt(89)\n\nBD = sqrt(80)\n\nCD = sqrt(41)\n\nSo, each face is a triangle with sides:\n\nFace ABC: AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80)\n\nFace ABD: AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89)\n\nFace ACD: AC = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41), AD = sqrt(89)\n\nFace BCD: BC = sqrt(89), CD = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80)\n\nSo, all four faces are congruent triangles, each with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89).\n\nWait, is that true? Let me check.\n\nYes, each face has the same set of edge lengths, just permuted.\n\nSo, all four faces are congruent triangles with sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nSo, I can compute the area of one face and multiply by four.\n\nLet me compute the area of triangle with sides a, b, c.\n\nUsing Heron's formula:\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2\n\nArea = sqrt( s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) )\n\nBut since the sides are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), perhaps it's easier to compute using the scalar triple product or another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the area of one face using vectors.\n\nWait, since I have coordinates, maybe it's easier to compute the area of one face using coordinates.\n\nLet's compute the area of triangle ABC.\n\nPoints A, B, C:\n\nA: (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB: (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC: (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nCompute vectors AB and AC.\n\nWait, but I can compute the area as half the magnitude of the cross product of AB and AC.\n\nWait, AB is vector from A to B: (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC is vector from A to C: (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCompute AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nAB \u00d7 AC = determinant:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k |\n|-4\u00a0\u00a0-5\u00a0\u00a0 0|\n|-4\u00a0\u00a0 0\u00a0\u00a0-8|\n\nCalculating:\n\ni*(-5*(-8) - 0*0) - j*(-4*(-8) - 0*(-4)) + k*(-4*0 - (-5)*(-4))\n\nSimplify each component:\n\ni*(40 - 0) - j*(32 - 0) + k*(0 - 20)\n\nSo,\n\ni*40 - j*32 + k*(-20)\n\nSo, AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this cross product is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7\n\nSo, sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2) * 12 sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21)\n\nTherefore, each face has area 6 sqrt(21). Since there are four faces, total surface area A = 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21)\n\nWait, let me verify that calculation.\n\nWait, when I computed the cross product, I got AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20). Then, the magnitude squared is 40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 = 1600 + 1024 + 400 = 3024. sqrt(3024) is sqrt(16*189) = 4*sqrt(189). 189 is 9*21, so sqrt(189) is 3*sqrt(21). So, sqrt(3024) = 4*3*sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21). Then, half of that is 6 sqrt(21). So, yes, correct.\n\nSo, each face has area 6 sqrt(21), total surface area is 24 sqrt(21).\n\nNow, compute the inradius r = 3V / A.\n\nV is 160/3, A is 24 sqrt(21).\n\nSo,\n\nr = (3 * (160/3)) / (24 sqrt(21)) = (160) / (24 sqrt(21)) = (160)/(24 sqrt(21)).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8: 160 \u00f7 8 = 20; 24 \u00f7 8 = 3.\n\nSo, 20 / (3 sqrt(21)).\n\nRationalizing the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):\n\n20 sqrt(21) / (3 * 21) = 20 sqrt(21) / 63.\n\nSo, r = 20 sqrt(21) / 63.\n\nCheck if this can be simplified further. 20 and 63 share no common factors besides 1, and 21 is square-free (since 21 = 3*7, both primes). So, this is the simplified form.\n\nSo, the distance is 20 sqrt(21) / 63.\n\nThus, m = 20, n = 21, p = 63.\n\nWait, but wait, m and p need to be coprime. Are 20 and 63 coprime? Yes, since 20 factors into 2^2 * 5, and 63 is 7 * 3^2. No common factors. So, that's okay.\n\nSo, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the Cayley-Menger determinant, the formula is 288 V\u00b2 = determinant. So, when I computed the scalar triple product, I found V = 160/3, so V\u00b2 = (160/3)^2. Then, 288 V\u00b2 should equal the determinant. Let me compute the determinant to see if it's correct.\n\nWait, but I already computed the volume via coordinates, so perhaps the Cayley-Menger determinant is not needed anymore. But let me just make sure that the volume is correct.\n\nWait, in the coordinate system, the scalar triple product gave me 320, so V = 320 / 6 = 160/3. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way: the volume of a tetrahedron can be found using base area times height, but since all faces are congruent, perhaps I can compute the height from a vertex to the opposite face.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the inradius another way to confirm.\n\nWait, another formula for inradius is r = 3V / A, as I used. So, 3*(160/3) = 160; 160 divided by (24 sqrt(21)) is 160/(24 sqrt(21)) = 20/(3 sqrt(21)) = 20 sqrt(21)/63. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my earlier calculation is correct. So, the answer is 20 sqrt(21)/63, which gives m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for the given edge lengths.\n\nLet me compute it step by step.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n| 0 \u00a0\u00a01 \u00a0\u00a01 \u00a0\u00a01 \u00a0\u00a01 |\n| 1 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a041 \u00a080 \u00a089 |\n| 1 \u00a041 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a089 \u00a080 |\n| 1 \u00a080 \u00a089 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a041 |\n| 1 \u00a089 \u00a080 \u00a041 \u00a0\u00a00 |\n\nI need to compute this determinant.\n\nCalculating a 5x5 determinant is quite involved. Maybe I can use expansion by minors or row operations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can observe some symmetry.\n\nLooking at the matrix, it's symmetric. The first row and column are [0,1,1,1,1], and the other rows and columns have a sort of symmetric pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can perform row and column operations to simplify the determinant.\n\nLet me denote the matrix as M.\n\nM = [\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n[1, 0, 41, 80, 89],\n[1, 41, 0, 89, 80],\n[1, 80, 89, 0, 41],\n[1, 89, 80, 41, 0]\n]\n\nLet me subtract the first row from the other rows to create zeros in the first column (except for the first entry).\n\nBut wait, the first row is [0,1,1,1,1], so subtracting it from the other rows may not directly help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can subtract row 2 from row 3, row 2 from row 4, etc., but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, since the matrix is symmetric, perhaps I can exploit that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant using the coordinates method, which I already did, and the volume is 160/3, so 288 V\u00b2 = 288*(160/3)^2.\n\nCompute 288*(160/3)^2:\n\n160/3 squared is (25600)/9.\n\nMultiply by 288: 288*(25600)/9 = (288/9)*25600 = 32 * 25600 = 819200.\n\nSo, determinant should be 819200.\n\nBut let me compute the determinant using another method to confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that the determinant is equal to the square of the volume times 288, which I found to be 819200.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the determinant numerically.\n\nBut that's time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can accept that the volume from the coordinate method is correct, as all steps seemed to check out.\n\nSo, I think my earlier result is correct.\n\nThus, the inradius is 20 sqrt(21)/63, so m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that when I computed the cross product for the area, I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, vectors AB and AC:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCompute cross product:\n\ni component: (-5*(-8) - 0*0) = 40 - 0 = 40\n\nj component: - [ (-4*(-8) - 0*(-4) ) ] = - [32 - 0] = -32\n\nk component: (-4*0 - (-5)*(-4)) = 0 - 20 = -20\n\nSo, cross product is (40, -32, -20), which is correct.\n\nMagnitude squared: 40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 = 1600 + 1024 + 400 = 3024\n\nSo, magnitude is sqrt(3024) = 12 sqrt(21), so area is 6 sqrt(21), correct.\n\nSo, total surface area is 24 sqrt(21), correct.\n\nInradius is 3V/A = 3*(160/3)/(24 sqrt(21)) = 160/(24 sqrt(21)) = 20/(3 sqrt(21)) = 20 sqrt(21)/63.\n\nYes, all steps are correct. So, the answer is 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given with specific lengths: AB and CD are sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are equal. I need to find this distance, which can be written in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, and then find m + n + p.\n\nHmm, okay. First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is called the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.\n\nTo find the inradius, I think I need the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area. Wait, actually, in a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius is 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. Let me recall the formula: r = 3V / A, where V is the volume and A is the total surface area.\n\nSo, my plan is to calculate the volume V of tetrahedron ABCD and its total surface area A, then compute r = 3V / A.\n\nBut first, how do I find the volume of a tetrahedron when I know all the edge lengths? I remember that for a tetrahedron, if you know all six edge lengths, you can use the Cayley-Menger determinant. That might be the way to go.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   a\u00b2   b\u00b2   c\u00b2 |\n| 1  a\u00b2   0    d\u00b2   e\u00b2 |\n| 1  b\u00b2  d\u00b2    0    f\u00b2 |\n| 1  c\u00b2  e\u00b2   f\u00b2    0  |\n\nThe determinant of this 5x5 matrix is proportional to the volume squared. The formula is:\n\n288 * V\u00b2 = determinant of the above matrix.\n\nSo, I can compute this determinant, take the square root, and then divide by 288^(1/2) to get V.\n\nLet me list the edge lengths again:\n\nAB = sqrt(41), so a\u00b2 = 41\n\nAC = sqrt(80), so b\u00b2 = 80\n\nAD = sqrt(89), so c\u00b2 = 89\n\nBC = sqrt(89), so d\u00b2 = 89\n\nBD = sqrt(80), so e\u00b2 = 80\n\nCD = sqrt(41), so f\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo, plugging these into the Cayley-Menger determinant matrix:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, let me make sure I get the positions right. The matrix is 5x5, with the first row and column being [0,1,1,1,1] and the subsequent rows and columns being the squares of the edge lengths.\n\nWait, actually, the Cayley-Menger determinant is a 5x5 matrix where the first row is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1], the first column is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]^T, and the other entries are the squares of the distances between the points.\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\nCM = [\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n[1, 0, AB\u00b2, AC\u00b2, AD\u00b2],\n[1, AB\u00b2, 0, BC\u00b2, BD\u00b2],\n[1, AC\u00b2, BC\u00b2, 0, CD\u00b2],\n[1, AD\u00b2, BD\u00b2, CD\u00b2, 0]\n]\n\nSo, substituting the values:\n\nCM = [\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n[1, 0, 41, 80, 89],\n[1, 41, 0, 89, 80],\n[1, 80, 89, 0, 41],\n[1, 89, 80, 41, 0]\n]\n\nOkay, now I need to compute the determinant of this matrix.\n\nCalculating a 5x5 determinant is going to be a bit tedious, but maybe I can find a pattern or simplify it somehow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can notice that the tetrahedron is isohedral or something, but the edge lengths are all different, so probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the tetrahedron can be embedded in 3D space in a symmetric way, but I'm not sure. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the determinant step by step.\n\nBut before I dive into that, maybe I can consider that this tetrahedron has some symmetry because opposite edges are equal.\n\nAB = CD = sqrt(41)\n\nAC = BD = sqrt(80)\n\nAD = BC = sqrt(89)\n\nSo, it's a kind of symmetric tetrahedron, sometimes called a \"disphenoid.\" In a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal, and the tetrahedron is face-transitive. So, perhaps the volume can be calculated more easily.\n\nWait, I remember that for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )) / 8\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe that's for a different case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find coordinates for the vertices.\n\nYes, maybe assigning coordinates to the vertices could help. Since it's a disphenoid, maybe I can position it such that the midpoints of opposite edges are aligned along certain axes.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me place the tetrahedron so that the midpoints of AB and CD are at the origin, and the line connecting them is along the z-axis.\n\nWait, but maybe a better approach is to place the points symmetrically.\n\nAlternatively, let me place the points as follows:\n\nLet me denote the points as A, B, C, D.\n\nSince AB = CD, AC = BD, AD = BC, perhaps the tetrahedron is symmetric in some way.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system such that the coordinates are symmetric.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates.\n\nLet me set point A at (x, y, z), point B at (-x, -y, z), point C at (-x, y, -z), and point D at (x, -y, -z). This way, the coordinates are symmetric with respect to the origin.\n\nLet me see if this works.\n\nThen, the midpoint of AB would be at (0, 0, z), and the midpoint of CD would be at (0, 0, -z). Similarly, midpoints of AC and BD would be at other symmetric points.\n\nBut perhaps this symmetry will help in computing the edge lengths.\n\nLet me compute AB, AC, etc., in terms of x, y, z.\n\nCompute AB: distance between A and B.\n\nA is (x, y, z), B is (-x, -y, z). So,\n\nAB\u00b2 = (x - (-x))\u00b2 + (y - (-y))\u00b2 + (z - z)\u00b2 = (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 = 4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2.\n\nGiven AB\u00b2 = 41, so 4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2 = 41 \u2192 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nSimilarly, compute AC: distance between A (x, y, z) and C (-x, y, -z).\n\nAC\u00b2 = (x - (-x))\u00b2 + (y - y)^2 + (z - (-z))\u00b2 = (2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2 = 4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2.\n\nGiven AC\u00b2 = 80, so 4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2 = 80 \u2192 x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, compute AD: distance between A (x, y, z) and D (x, -y, -z).\n\nAD\u00b2 = (x - x)^2 + (y - (-y))^2 + (z - (-z))^2 = 0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 = 4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2.\n\nGiven AD\u00b2 = 89, so 4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2 = 89 \u2192 y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo now, I have three equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n\n2. x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\n\n3. y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nI can solve these equations to find x\u00b2, y\u00b2, z\u00b2.\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 3:\n\n(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = (89/4) - (41/4)\n\nz\u00b2 - x\u00b2 = (89 - 41)/4 = 48/4 = 12.\n\nSo, z\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 12.\n\nFrom equation 2: x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20.\n\nSubstitute z\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 12:\n\nx\u00b2 + (x\u00b2 + 12) = 20 \u2192 2x\u00b2 + 12 = 20 \u2192 2x\u00b2 = 8 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 4 \u2192 x = \u00b12.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 4.\n\nThen, from equation 2: x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20 \u2192 4 + z\u00b2 = 20 \u2192 z\u00b2 = 16 \u2192 z = \u00b14.\n\nFrom equation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4 \u2192 4 + y\u00b2 = 41/4 \u2192 y\u00b2 = 41/4 - 16/4 = 25/4 \u2192 y = \u00b15/2.\n\nSo, now, x = \u00b12, y = \u00b15/2, z = \u00b14.\n\nSo, the coordinates of the four points are:\n\nA: (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB: (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC: (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nD: (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nPoint A: (x, y, z) = (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nPoint B: (-x, -y, z) = (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nPoint C: (-x, y, -z) = (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nPoint D: (x, -y, -z) = (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nYes, that should satisfy the edge lengths.\n\nNow, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron.\n\nThe volume of a tetrahedron can be found using the scalar triple product formula:\n\nV = | (AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD)) | / 6\n\nBut wait, let me compute vectors AB, AC, AD, then find the scalar triple product.\n\nWait, but with the coordinates assigned, perhaps it's easier to use the determinant formula.\n\nAlternatively, since I have coordinates for all four points, I can compute the volume using the determinant.\n\nGiven four points A, B, C, D, the volume is |det(B - A, C - A, D - A)| / 6.\n\nSo, let's compute vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nWait, actually, vectors AB, AC, AD are from point A to points B, C, D.\n\nBut in the determinant formula, we need vectors from the same point, so vectors AB, AC, AD are from A to B, A to C, A to D.\n\nSo, let's compute vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nVector AB = B - A = (-2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, 4 - 4) = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nVector AC = C - A = (-2 - 2, 5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nVector AD = D - A = (2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (0, -5, -8)\n\nSo, the three vectors are:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nNow, the scalar triple product is AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD).\n\nFirst, compute the cross product AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nCross product AC \u00d7 AD is determinant:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k |\n|-4\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0-8|\n|0\u00a0\u00a0-5\u00a0\u00a0-8|\n\nCalculating:\n\ni*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)\n\nSimplify each component:\n\ni*(0 - 40) - j*(32 - 0) + k*(20 - 0)\n\nSo,\n\ni*(-40) - j*(32) + k*(20)\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nNow, compute AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD):\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nDot product with (-40, -32, 20):\n\n(-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320\n\nSo, the scalar triple product is 320.\n\nHence, the volume V is |320| / 6 = 320 / 6 = 160 / 3.\n\nWait, that seems a bit large. Let me check my calculations.\n\nWait, let me recompute the cross product.\n\nAC \u00d7 AD:\n\ni component: (0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) = 0 - 40 = -40\n\nj component: - [ (-4*(-8) - (-8)*0 ) ] = - [32 - 0] = -32\n\nk component: (-4*(-5) - 0*0 ) = 20 - 0 = 20\n\nSo, yes, AC \u00d7 AD is (-40, -32, 20).\n\nThen, AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD) is (-4)(-40) + (-5)(-32) + (0)(20) = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320.\n\nSo, yes, the volume is 320 / 6 = 160/3.\n\nSo, V = 160/3.\n\nWait, that's a positive number, which makes sense. So, volume is 160/3.\n\nNow, moving on to the surface area.\n\nThe total surface area A is the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces.\n\nEach face is a triangle, so I can compute the area of each triangle using Heron's formula.\n\nBut let me first find the lengths of all edges again, just to make sure.\n\nGiven:\n\nAB = sqrt(41)\n\nAC = sqrt(80)\n\nAD = sqrt(89)\n\nBC = sqrt(89)\n\nBD = sqrt(80)\n\nCD = sqrt(41)\n\nSo, each face is a triangle with sides:\n\nFace ABC: AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80)\n\nFace ABD: AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89)\n\nFace ACD: AC = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41), AD = sqrt(89)\n\nFace BCD: BC = sqrt(89), CD = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80)\n\nSo, all four faces are congruent triangles, each with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89).\n\nWait, is that true? Let me check.\n\nYes, each face has the same set of edge lengths, just permuted.\n\nSo, all four faces are congruent triangles with sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nSo, I can compute the area of one face and multiply by four.\n\nLet me compute the area of triangle with sides a, b, c.\n\nUsing Heron's formula:\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2\n\nArea = sqrt( s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) )\n\nBut since the sides are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), perhaps it's easier to compute using the scalar triple product or another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the area of one face using vectors.\n\nWait, since I have coordinates, maybe it's easier to compute the area of one face using coordinates.\n\nLet's compute the area of triangle ABC.\n\nPoints A, B, C:\n\nA: (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB: (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC: (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nCompute vectors AB and AC.\n\nWait, but I can compute the area as half the magnitude of the cross product of AB and AC.\n\nWait, AB is vector from A to B: (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC is vector from A to C: (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCompute AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nAB \u00d7 AC = determinant:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k |\n|-4\u00a0\u00a0-5\u00a0\u00a0 0|\n|-4\u00a0\u00a0 0\u00a0\u00a0-8|\n\nCalculating:\n\ni*(-5*(-8) - 0*0) - j*(-4*(-8) - 0*(-4)) + k*(-4*0 - (-5)*(-4))\n\nSimplify each component:\n\ni*(40 - 0) - j*(32 - 0) + k*(0 - 20)\n\nSo,\n\ni*40 - j*32 + k*(-20)\n\nSo, AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this cross product is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7\n\nSo, sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2) * 12 sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21)\n\nTherefore, each face has area 6 sqrt(21). Since there are four faces, total surface area A = 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21)\n\nWait, let me verify that calculation.\n\nWait, when I computed the cross product, I got AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20). Then, the magnitude squared is 40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 = 1600 + 1024 + 400 = 3024. sqrt(3024) is sqrt(16*189) = 4*sqrt(189). 189 is 9*21, so sqrt(189) is 3*sqrt(21). So, sqrt(3024) = 4*3*sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21). Then, half of that is 6 sqrt(21). So, yes, correct.\n\nSo, each face has area 6 sqrt(21), total surface area is 24 sqrt(21).\n\nNow, compute the inradius r = 3V / A.\n\nV is 160/3, A is 24 sqrt(21).\n\nSo,\n\nr = (3 * (160/3)) / (24 sqrt(21)) = (160) / (24 sqrt(21)) = (160)/(24 sqrt(21)).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8: 160 \u00f7 8 = 20; 24 \u00f7 8 = 3.\n\nSo, 20 / (3 sqrt(21)).\n\nRationalizing the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):\n\n20 sqrt(21) / (3 * 21) = 20 sqrt(21) / 63.\n\nSo, r = 20 sqrt(21) / 63.\n\nCheck if this can be simplified further. 20 and 63 share no common factors besides 1, and 21 is square-free (since 21 = 3*7, both primes). So, this is the simplified form.\n\nSo, the distance is 20 sqrt(21) / 63.\n\nThus, m = 20, n = 21, p = 63.\n\nWait, but wait, m and p need to be coprime. Are 20 and 63 coprime? Yes, since 20 factors into 2^2 * 5, and 63 is 7 * 3^2. No common factors. So, that's okay.\n\nSo, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the Cayley-Menger determinant, the formula is 288 V\u00b2 = determinant. So, when I computed the scalar triple product, I found V = 160/3, so V\u00b2 = (160/3)^2. Then, 288 V\u00b2 should equal the determinant. Let me compute the determinant to see if it's correct.\n\nWait, but I already computed the volume via coordinates, so perhaps the Cayley-Menger determinant is not needed anymore. But let me just make sure that the volume is correct.\n\nWait, in the coordinate system, the scalar triple product gave me 320, so V = 320 / 6 = 160/3. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way: the volume of a tetrahedron can be found using base area times height, but since all faces are congruent, perhaps I can compute the height from a vertex to the opposite face.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the inradius another way to confirm.\n\nWait, another formula for inradius is r = 3V / A, as I used. So, 3*(160/3) = 160; 160 divided by (24 sqrt(21)) is 160/(24 sqrt(21)) = 20/(3 sqrt(21)) = 20 sqrt(21)/63. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my earlier calculation is correct. So, the answer is 20 sqrt(21)/63, which gives m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for the given edge lengths.\n\nLet me compute it step by step.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n| 0 \u00a0\u00a01 \u00a0\u00a01 \u00a0\u00a01 \u00a0\u00a01 |\n| 1 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a041 \u00a080 \u00a089 |\n| 1 \u00a041 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a089 \u00a080 |\n| 1 \u00a080 \u00a089 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a041 |\n| 1 \u00a089 \u00a080 \u00a041 \u00a0\u00a00 |\n\nI need to compute this determinant.\n\nCalculating a 5x5 determinant is quite involved. Maybe I can use expansion by minors or row operations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can observe some symmetry.\n\nLooking at the matrix, it's symmetric. The first row and column are [0,1,1,1,1], and the other rows and columns have a sort of symmetric pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can perform row and column operations to simplify the determinant.\n\nLet me denote the matrix as M.\n\nM = [\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n[1, 0, 41, 80, 89],\n[1, 41, 0, 89, 80],\n[1, 80, 89, 0, 41],\n[1, 89, 80, 41, 0]\n]\n\nLet me subtract the first row from the other rows to create zeros in the first column (except for the first entry).\n\nBut wait, the first row is [0,1,1,1,1], so subtracting it from the other rows may not directly help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can subtract row 2 from row 3, row 2 from row 4, etc., but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, since the matrix is symmetric, perhaps I can exploit that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant using the coordinates method, which I already did, and the volume is 160/3, so 288 V\u00b2 = 288*(160/3)^2.\n\nCompute 288*(160/3)^2:\n\n160/3 squared is (25600)/9.\n\nMultiply by 288: 288*(25600)/9 = (288/9)*25600 = 32 * 25600 = 819200.\n\nSo, determinant should be 819200.\n\nBut let me compute the determinant using another method to confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that the determinant is equal to the square of the volume times 288, which I found to be 819200.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the determinant numerically.\n\nBut that's time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can accept that the volume from the coordinate method is correct, as all steps seemed to check out.\n\nSo, I think my earlier result is correct.\n\nThus, the inradius is 20 sqrt(21)/63, so m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that when I computed the cross product for the area, I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, vectors AB and AC:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCompute cross product:\n\ni component: (-5*(-8) - 0*0) = 40 - 0 = 40\n\nj component: - [ (-4*(-8) - 0*(-4) ) ] = - [32 - 0] = -32\n\nk component: (-4*0 - (-5)*(-4)) = 0 - 20 = -20\n\nSo, cross product is (40, -32, -20), which is correct.\n\nMagnitude squared: 40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 = 1600 + 1024 + 400 = 3024\n\nSo, magnitude is sqrt(3024) = 12 sqrt(21), so area is 6 sqrt(21), correct.\n\nSo, total surface area is 24 sqrt(21), correct.\n\nInradius is 3V/A = 3*(160/3)/(24 sqrt(21)) = 160/(24 sqrt(21)) = 20/(3 sqrt(21)) = 20 sqrt(21)/63.\n\nYes, all steps are correct. So, the answer is 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first recognize that the tetrahedron \\(ABCD\\) is a disphenoid with opposite edges equal: \\(AB = CD = \\sqrt{41}\\), \\(AC = BD = \\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(BC = AD = \\sqrt{89}\\). The inradius \\(r\\) of a tetrahedron is given by \\(r = \\frac{3V}{A}\\), where \\(V\\) is the volume and \\(A\\) is the total surface area.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Volume \\(V\\)\nWe assign coordinates to the vertices to simplify calculations:\n- \\(A = (2, \\frac{5}{2}, 4)\\)\n- \\(B = (-2, -\\frac{5}{2}, 4)\\)\n- \\(C = (-2, \\frac{5}{2}, -4)\\)\n- \\(D = (2, -\\frac{5}{2}, -4)\\)\n\nUsing the scalar triple product, we compute vectors:\n- \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} = (-4, -5, 0)\\)\n- \\(\\overrightarrow{AC} = (-4, 0, -8)\\)\n- \\(\\overrightarrow{AD} = (0, -5, -8)\\)\n\nThe cross product \\(\\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD}\\) yields \\((-40, -32, 20)\\). The dot product \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} \\cdot (\\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD})\\) is \\(320\\). Thus, the volume is:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{6} |320| = \\frac{160}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Surface Area \\(A\\)\nEach face is a triangle with sides \\(\\sqrt{41}\\), \\(\\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{89}\\). Using Heron's formula, the area of one face is:\n\\[\ns = \\frac{\\sqrt{41} + \\sqrt{80} + \\sqrt{89}}{2}, \\quad \\text{Area} = \\sqrt{s(s - \\sqrt{41})(s - \\sqrt{80})(s - \\sqrt{89})}\n\\]\nHowever, using the cross product for vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{AB}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{AC}\\), the area of one face is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12\\sqrt{21} = 6\\sqrt{21}\n\\]\nTotal surface area:\n\\[\nA = 4 \\times 6\\sqrt{21} = 24\\sqrt{21}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Inradius \\(r\\)\nUsing the formula \\(r = \\frac{3V}{A}\\):\n\\[\nr = \\frac{3 \\times \\frac{160}{3}}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{160}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}\n\\]\nThus, \\(m = 20\\), \\(n = 21\\), and \\(p = 63\\). Therefore, \\(m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\\).\n\n\\boxed{104}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given with specific lengths: AB and CD are both \u221a41, AC and BD are \u221a80, and BC and AD are \u221a89. I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer should be in the form m\u221an/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, I have to find m + n + p.\n\nHmm, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula similar to the 2D case with triangles, but it involves the volume and the surface area. Specifically, the formula is r = 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. Wait, is that right? Let me think. In 3D, the inradius is the radius of the sphere tangent to all faces, so the volume can be expressed as (1/3) * surface area * inradius. Therefore, inradius r = 3V / S_total, yes.\n\nSo, my plan is to first compute the volume V of the tetrahedron, then compute the total surface area S, and then plug them into r = 3V / S.\n\nBut to compute the volume, I might need coordinates for the vertices. Since the given edge lengths have a sort of symmetry (opposite edges are equal), maybe the tetrahedron is \"isohedral\" or has some symmetry that I can exploit to assign coordinates.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the vertices. Let's put point A at (0, 0, 0). Then, let me assign coordinates to other points such that the edge lengths are satisfied.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to realize that such a tetrahedron is a \"disphemoid\" or something similar, where opposite edges are equal. I think in such cases, the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system where the coordinates are symmetric.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron given the lengths of its edges. There's a formula called the Cayley-Menger determinant which can compute the volume based on all the edge lengths. Maybe that's the way to go, especially since the edge lengths are all given.\n\nYes, let's recall the Cayley-Menger determinant. For a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f, the volume V is given by:\n\nV = sqrt( CM / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   a\u00b2   b\u00b2   c\u00b2 |\n| 1  a\u00b2   0    d\u00b2   e\u00b2 |\n| 1  b\u00b2  d\u00b2    0    f\u00b2 |\n| 1  c\u00b2  e\u00b2   f\u00b2    0  |\n\nSo, I need to plug in the given edge lengths into this matrix and compute the determinant.\n\nGiven the edge lengths:\n\nAB = sqrt(41) => a\u00b2 = 41\nAC = sqrt(80) => b\u00b2 = 80\nAD = sqrt(89) => c\u00b2 = 89\nBC = sqrt(89) => d\u00b2 = 89\nBD = sqrt(80) => e\u00b2 = 80\nCD = sqrt(41) => f\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo, the Cayley-Menger matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nNow, I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. That's going to be a bit involved, but let's proceed step by step.\n\nLet me denote the Cayley-Menger matrix as M:\n\nM = [\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n[1, 0, 41, 80, 89],\n[1, 41, 0, 89, 80],\n[1, 80, 89, 0, 41],\n[1, 89, 80, 41, 0]\n]\n\nCalculating the determinant of a 5x5 matrix is quite tedious. Maybe I can find some pattern or symmetry to simplify it.\n\nLooking at the matrix, it's symmetric across the main diagonal, except for the first row and column. Wait, actually, it's symmetric because all the off-diagonal elements in the lower triangle mirror those in the upper triangle.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a way to exploit that symmetry. Alternatively, maybe I can perform row or column operations to simplify the determinant.\n\nLet me consider expanding the determinant along the first row. The determinant would be:\n\n0 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor)\n\nBut since the first element is 0, that term drops out. So,\n\ndet(M) = -1 * det(M1) + 1 * det(M2) -1 * det(M3) +1 * det(M4)\n\nWhere M1, M2, M3, M4 are the minors corresponding to the elements in the first row (excluding the first element, which is 0).\n\nWait, actually, the cofactor expansion along the first row would be:\n\nsum_{j=1 to 5} (-1)^{1+j} * M[0][j] * det(Minor[0][j])\n\nSince M[0][0] is 0, that term is zero. The rest:\n\nj=1: (-1)^{1+1} * 1 * det(Minor[0][1])\nj=2: (-1)^{1+2} * 1 * det(Minor[0][2])\nj=3: (-1)^{1+3} * 1 * det(Minor[0][3])\nj=4: (-1)^{1+4} * 1 * det(Minor[0][4])\nj=5: (-1)^{1+5} * 1 * det(Minor[0][5])\n\nWait, but the first row is [0,1,1,1,1], so the minors are for the positions (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5). But in a 5x5 matrix, indices go from 0 to 4, so perhaps I have a typo here. Let me correct.\n\nWait, the first row is index 0, and the columns are 0 to 4. So, j runs from 0 to 4.\n\nSo, the determinant expansion along the first row (index 0) is:\n\nsum_{j=0 to 4} (-1)^{0+j} * M[0][j] * det(Minor[0][j])\n\nWhich is:\n\nM[0][0] * det(...) - M[0][1] * det(...) + M[0][2] * det(...) - M[0][3] * det(...) + M[0][4] * det(...)\n\nBut M[0][0] is 0, so the first term is zero.\n\nSo, det(M) = -1 * det(M1) + 1 * det(M2) -1 * det(M3) +1 * det(M4)\n\nWhere:\n\nM1 is the minor for (0,1), which is the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing row 0 and column 1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo, let's compute each minor.\n\nFirst, Minor M1: remove row 0 and column 1.\n\nOriginal rows (excluding row 0):\n\nRow1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nSo, removing column 1 (index 1) from each row:\n\nRow1 becomes: [1, 41, 80, 89]\n\nWait no, original columns are 0 to 4. So removing column 1, we have columns 0, 2, 3, 4.\n\nWait, row1 is [1,0,41,80,89]. Removing column1 (which is index1, the second element), the new row is [1,41,80,89].\n\nSimilarly, row2 is [1,41,0,89,80]. Removing column1: [1,0,89,80]\n\nRow3: [1,80,89,0,41]. Removing column1: [1,89,0,41]\n\nRow4: [1,89,80,41,0]. Removing column1: [1,80,41,0]\n\nSo, minor M1 is the 4x4 matrix:\n\n[\n[1,41,80,89],\n[1,0,89,80],\n[1,89,0,41],\n[1,80,41,0]\n]\n\nSimilarly, compute the determinant of this matrix.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can compute the determinant numerically, but perhaps there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can subtract rows to create zeros.\n\nLet me denote minor M1 as:\n\nRow1: 1,41,80,89\n\nRow2: 1,0,89,80\n\nRow3: 1,89,0,41\n\nRow4: 1,80,41,0\n\nLet me subtract Row1 from Row2, Row3, Row4.\n\nRow2_new = Row2 - Row1:\n\n1-1=0, 0-41=-41, 89-80=9, 80-89=-9\n\nRow3_new = Row3 - Row1:\n\n1-1=0, 89-41=48, 0-80=-80, 41-89=-48\n\nRow4_new = Row4 - Row1:\n\n1-1=0, 80-41=39, 41-80=-39, 0-89=-89\n\nSo, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow1: 1,41,80,89\n\nRow2: 0,-41,9,-9\n\nRow3: 0,48,-80,-48\n\nRow4: 0,39,-39,-89\n\nNow, since the first column has 1 followed by zeros, it's easier to compute the determinant by expanding along the first column.\n\nThe determinant of M1 is equal to the determinant of the 4x4 matrix above.\n\nExpanding along the first column, which is [1,0,0,0], the determinant is 1 * det of the minor obtained by removing row1 and column1.\n\nSo, the minor is the 3x3 matrix:\n\nRow2: -41,9,-9\n\nRow3: 48,-80,-48\n\nRow4: 39,-39,-89\n\nNow, compute the determinant of this 3x3 matrix.\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\n| -41   9    -9  |\n| 48  -80  -48  |\n| 39  -39  -89  |\n\nCompute this determinant.\n\nI'll use the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion.\n\nLet's compute it as:\n\n-41 * [(-80)(-89) - (-48)(-39)] - 9 * [48*(-89) - (-48)*39] + (-9) * [48*(-39) - (-80)*39]\n\nCompute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: -41 * [ (80*89) - (48*39) ]\n\nCompute 80*89: 80*90=7200 minus 80=7120.\n\n48*39: 48*(40-1)=1920 -48=1872.\n\nSo, first term: -41 * (7120 - 1872) = -41*(5248) = Let's compute 41*5248.\n\nWait, 41 * 5000 = 205000, 41*248= 41*(200+48)=8200 + 1968=10168. So total is 205000 +10168=215168. So first term is -215168.\n\nSecond term: -9 * [48*(-89) - (-48)*39]\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n48*(-89) = -4272\n\n-48*(-39) = +1872\n\nSo, -4272 +1872 = -2400.\n\nMultiply by -9: -9*(-2400) = +21600.\n\nThird term: (-9) * [48*(-39) - (-80)*39]\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n48*(-39) = -1872\n\n-80*(-39) = +3120\n\nSo, -1872 +3120 = 1248.\n\nMultiply by (-9): (-9)*1248 = -11232.\n\nSo, adding all three terms:\n\nFirst term: -215168\n\nSecond term: +21600\n\nThird term: -11232\n\nTotal: (-215168) + 21600 = (-193568) + (-11232) = -204800.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\n-215168 + 21600 = (-215168 + 21600) = (-193568). Then, -193568 -11232 = (-204800). So determinant of the 3x3 matrix is -204800.\n\nBut wait, wait, the determinant is computed as:\n\n= -41*(5248) -9*(-2400) + (-9)*(1248)\n\nWhich is:\n\n-215168 +21600 -11232.\n\nWait, that would be:\n\n-215168 +21600 = -193568\n\nThen, -193568 -11232 = -204800.\n\nSo, the determinant is -204800.\n\nBut wait, that seems very large. Let me verify the calculations step by step.\n\nFirst term: -41*(7120 - 1872) = -41*(5248) = -41*5248.\n\nCompute 5248 *40=209920, 5248*1=5248, so total 209920 +5248=215168. So yes, -215168.\n\nSecond term: -9*[48*(-89) - (-48)*39] = -9*(-4272 +1872) = -9*(-2400)= +21600.\n\nThird term: (-9)*[48*(-39) - (-80)*39] = (-9)*(-1872 +3120) = (-9)*(1248)= -11232.\n\nAdding up: -215168 +21600 = -193568; -193568 -11232= -204800.\n\nSo yes, the determinant is -204800.\n\nTherefore, the determinant of minor M1 is -204800.\n\nBut wait, no, that's the determinant of the 3x3 matrix, which was the minor after expanding. So the determinant of the 4x4 matrix (minor M1) is 1 * (-204800) = -204800.\n\nWait, no, when you expand the 4x4 determinant, you get 1 multiplied by the determinant of the 3x3 matrix, which is -204800. So det(M1) = -204800.\n\nHmm, but let me think again: when we subtracted Row1 from the other rows, the determinant of the 4x4 matrix is the same as the determinant of the transformed matrix because we performed row operations that don't change the determinant (since we subtracted rows, which is adding a multiple of a row, so determinant remains same).\n\nSo, the determinant of minor M1 is -204800.\n\nNow, moving on to compute the determinant of minor M2.\n\nWait, this is getting really time-consuming, but let me try to proceed.\n\nMinor M2 is the minor for element (0,2), which is the element in row 0, column 2, which is 1. So, we remove row 0 and column 2.\n\nOriginal matrix M:\n\nRow0: 0,1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow2:1,41,0,89,80\n\nRow3:1,80,89,0,41\n\nRow4:1,89,80,41,0\n\nSo, removing row 0 and column 2, the minor M2 is the 4x4 matrix:\n\nRow1: 1,0,80,89\n\nRow2:1,41,89,80\n\nRow3:1,80,0,41\n\nRow4:1,89,41,0\n\nWait, let me double-check. Removing column 2 (index 2, which is the third element) from each row:\n\nRow1: [1,0,80,89] (since original row1 is [1,0,41,80,89])\n\nRow2: [1,41,89,80]\n\nRow3: [1,80,0,41]\n\nRow4: [1,89,41,0]\n\nSo, the minor M2 is:\n\n[\n[1,0,80,89],\n[1,41,89,80],\n[1,80,0,41],\n[1,89,41,0]\n]\n\nNow, compute det(M2).\n\nAgain, perhaps perform row operations to simplify.\n\nSubtract Row1 from Row2, Row3, Row4.\n\nRow2_new = Row2 - Row1: [0,41,9,-9]\n\nRow3_new = Row3 - Row1: [0,80,-80,-48]\n\nRow4_new = Row4 - Row1: [0,89,-41,-89]\n\nSo, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow1: [1,0,80,89]\n\nRow2: [0,41,9,-9]\n\nRow3: [0,80,-80,-48]\n\nRow4: [0,89,-41,-89]\n\nAgain, expand the determinant along the first column, which is [1,0,0,0], so the determinant is 1 * det of the minor obtained by removing Row1 and Column1.\n\nThe minor is the 3x3 matrix:\n\nRow2:41,9,-9\n\nRow3:80,-80,-48\n\nRow4:89,-41,-89\n\nCompute determinant of this matrix.\n\nAgain, using the same method.\n\nCompute:\n\n41 * [ (-80)(-89) - (-48)(-41) ] - 9 * [80*(-89) - (-48)*89 ] + (-9) * [80*(-41) - (-80)*89 ]\n\nCompute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term:41*(7120 - 1968)=41*(5152)= Let's compute 41*5000=205000, 41*152=6232, so total 205000+6232=211232.\n\nSecond term: -9*( -7120 + 4272 )= -9*(-2848)= +25632.\n\nThird term: (-9)*( -3280 + 7120 )= (-9)*(3840)= -34560.\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n211232 +25632 = 236864; 236864 -34560=202304.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nFirst term:41*(7120 - 1968)=41*5152=211232.\n\nSecond term: -9*(80*(-89) - (-48)*89)= -9*(-7120 +4272)= -9*(-2848)=25632.\n\nThird term: (-9)*(80*(-41) - (-80)*89)= (-9)*(-3280 +7120)= (-9)*(3840)= -34560.\n\nSo, 211232 +25632=236864; 236864 -34560=202304.\n\nSo, the determinant of this 3x3 matrix is 202304.\n\nTherefore, the determinant of minor M2 is 1 * 202304 = 202304.\n\nProceeding similarly, compute det(M3), which is the minor for (0,3). Let's see.\n\nMinor M3 is obtained by removing row 0 and column 3.\n\nSo, the original matrix M:\n\nRow0:0,1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow2:1,41,0,89,80\n\nRow3:1,80,89,0,41\n\nRow4:1,89,80,41,0\n\nRemoving column 3 (index3, which is the fourth element), so from each row:\n\nRow1: [1,0,41,89]\n\nRow2: [1,41,0,80]\n\nRow3: [1,80,89,41]\n\nRow4: [1,89,80,0]\n\nSo, minor M3 is:\n\n[\n[1,0,41,89],\n[1,41,0,80],\n[1,80,89,41],\n[1,89,80,0]\n]\n\nCompute determinant of this 4x4 matrix.\n\nAgain, perhaps perform row operations. Subtract Row1 from Row2, Row3, Row4.\n\nRow2_new = Row2 - Row1: [0,41,-41,-9]\n\nRow3_new = Row3 - Row1: [0,80,48,-48]\n\nRow4_new = Row4 - Row1: [0,89,39,-89]\n\nSo, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow1: [1,0,41,89]\n\nRow2: [0,41,-41,-9]\n\nRow3: [0,80,48,-48]\n\nRow4: [0,89,39,-89]\n\nAgain, expand the determinant along the first column, which is [1,0,0,0], so the determinant is 1 * det of the minor.\n\nThe minor is the 3x3 matrix:\n\nRow2:41,-41,-9\n\nRow3:80,48,-48\n\nRow4:89,39,-89\n\nCompute determinant:\n\n41 * [48*(-89) - (-48)*39] - (-41) * [80*(-89) - (-48)*89] + (-9) * [80*39 -48*89]\n\nCompute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term:41*( -4272 + 1872 )=41*(-2400)= -98400.\n\nSecond term: -(-41)*( -7120 +4272 )=41*(-2848)= -116768.\n\nWait, wait, let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst term: 41*( [48*(-89) - (-48)*39] )\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n48*(-89)= -4272\n\n(-48)*39= -1872\n\nSo, 48*(-89) - (-48)*39 = -4272 +1872= -2400.\n\nSo, first term:41*(-2400)= -98400.\n\nSecond term: -(-41)*[80*(-89) - (-48)*89]\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n80*(-89)= -7120\n\n(-48)*89= -4272\n\nSo, 80*(-89) - (-48)*89= -7120 +4272= -2848.\n\nMultiply by -(-41)=41: 41*(-2848)= -116768.\n\nThird term: (-9)*[80*39 -48*89]\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n80*39=3120\n\n48*89=4272\n\nSo, 3120 -4272= -1152.\n\nMultiply by (-9): (-9)*(-1152)=10368.\n\nNow, sum all three terms:\n\n-98400 -116768 +10368.\n\nCompute:\n\n-98400 -116768= -215168\n\n-215168 +10368= -204800.\n\nSo, the determinant of the 3x3 matrix is -204800.\n\nTherefore, the determinant of minor M3 is 1*(-204800)= -204800.\n\nMoving on to minor M4, which is the minor for (0,4), meaning removing row 0 and column4.\n\nSo, from the original matrix M, remove row0 and column4:\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80\n\nRow2:1,41,0,89\n\nRow3:1,80,89,0\n\nRow4:1,89,80,41\n\nSo, minor M4 is:\n\n[\n[1,0,41,80],\n[1,41,0,89],\n[1,80,89,0],\n[1,89,80,41]\n]\n\nCompute determinant of this 4x4 matrix.\n\nAgain, perform row operations. Subtract Row1 from Row2, Row3, Row4.\n\nRow2_new = Row2 - Row1: [0,41,-41,9]\n\nRow3_new = Row3 - Row1: [0,80,48,-80]\n\nRow4_new = Row4 - Row1: [0,89,39,-39]\n\nSo, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow1: [1,0,41,80]\n\nRow2: [0,41,-41,9]\n\nRow3: [0,80,48,-80]\n\nRow4: [0,89,39,-39]\n\nAgain, expanding along the first column [1,0,0,0], determinant is 1 * det of the minor.\n\nThe minor is the 3x3 matrix:\n\nRow2:41,-41,9\n\nRow3:80,48,-80\n\nRow4:89,39,-39\n\nCompute determinant.\n\n41*(48*(-39) - (-80)*39) - (-41)*(80*(-39) - (-80)*89) +9*(80*39 -48*89)\n\nCompute each term.\n\nFirst term:41*( -1872 + 3120 )=41*(1248)=51168.\n\nSecond term: -(-41)*( -3120 +7120 )=41*(4000)=164000.\n\nWait, wait, let's go step by step.\n\nFirst term:41*(48*(-39) - (-80)*39)\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n48*(-39)= -1872\n\n(-80)*39= -3120\n\nWait, wait, no: the expression is 48*(-39) - (-80)*39 = -1872 +3120=1248.\n\nSo, 41*1248=51168.\n\nSecond term: -(-41)*(80*(-39) - (-80)*89)\n\nInside the brackets:\n\n80*(-39)= -3120\n\n(-80)*89= -7120\n\nSo, 80*(-39) - (-80)*89= -3120 +7120=4000.\n\nMultiply by -(-41)=41: 41*4000=164000.\n\nThird term:9*(80*39 -48*89)\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n80*39=3120\n\n48*89=4272\n\nSo, 3120 -4272= -1152.\n\nMultiply by 9: 9*(-1152)= -10368.\n\nNow, sum all terms:\n\n51168 +164000=215168; 215168 -10368=204800.\n\nSo, the determinant of the 3x3 matrix is 204800.\n\nTherefore, determinant of minor M4 is 1*204800=204800.\n\nNow, going back to the original expansion of the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\ndet(M) = -det(M1) + det(M2) - det(M3) + det(M4)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ndet(M) = -(-204800) + 202304 - (-204800) +204800\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-(-204800)= +204800\n\n+202304\n\n-(-204800)= +204800\n\n+204800\n\nSo, adding all together:\n\n204800 +202304=407104\n\n407104 +204800=611904\n\n611904 +204800=816704\n\nSo, det(M)=816704.\n\nWait, that seems very large. Let me check the signs again.\n\ndet(M) = -det(M1) + det(M2) - det(M3) + det(M4)\n\nWhich is:\n\n-(-204800) = +204800\n\n+202304\n\n-(-204800)= +204800\n\n+204800\n\nSo, yes, 204800 +202304=407104\n\n407104 +204800=611904\n\n611904 +204800=816704.\n\nSo, det(M)=816704.\n\nWait, but the Cayley-Menger determinant is supposed to be positive? Or can it be negative? I think it's squared in the volume formula, so maybe the sign doesn't matter.\n\nWait, the volume is sqrt( |det(M)| / 288 ). Because the determinant can be negative, but the volume is positive.\n\nSo, |det(M)| = 816704.\n\nTherefore, V = sqrt(816704 / 288 )\n\nCompute 816704 /288.\n\nLet me compute 816704 \u00f7 288.\n\nFirst, note that 288=16*18.\n\nLet me compute 816704 \u00f7 16=51043. So, 816704 \u00f7 288=51043 \u00f718.\n\nCompute 51043 \u00f718:\n\n18*2835=51030. 51043 -51030=13. So, 2835 +13/18=2835.7222...\n\nBut perhaps we can factor 816704 and 288 to simplify the fraction.\n\nFactor 816704:\n\nDivide by 16: 816704 \u00f716=51044.\n\nWait, wait, 16*51044=816,704.\n\n51044: Let's factor further.\n\n51044 \u00f74=12761.\n\n12761: Let me check divisibility. 12761 \u00f77= 1823, which is prime? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 12761 is 12761.\n\nWait, perhaps 12761 is a square? Let me see: 113\u00b2=12769, which is higher. 112\u00b2=12544. So, not a perfect square.\n\nSo, 816704=16 *4 *12761=64 *12761.\n\nSimilarly, 288=16*18=16*2*9=32*9.\n\nSo, 816704 /288= (64*12761)/(32*9)= (2*12761)/9=25522/9.\n\nSo, 816704 /288=25522/9.\n\nSo, V= sqrt(25522/9)=sqrt(25522)/3.\n\nWait, but 25522 is even, so divide by 2:25522=2*12761.\n\nSo, sqrt(25522)=sqrt(2*12761).\n\nHmm, is 12761 a square? Let's check: 113\u00b2=12769, which is 8 more than 12761. So, 12761 is not a perfect square.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.\n\nWait, 816704 /288= (816704 \u00f716)=51044; 51044 \u00f718=51044/18=2835.777...\n\nWait, 2835.777... is 2835 and 7/9, but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps my earlier computation of the determinant is wrong. Let me check.\n\nWait, this is taking too long. Maybe I should double-check the Cayley-Menger determinant calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute the volume. Since the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, perhaps it's a \"equifacial\" tetrahedron or something similar, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: since all opposite edges are equal, the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system such that the coordinates are symmetric.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the vertices such that:\n\nLet\u2019s place the points as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let point A be at (x, y, z), point B at (-x, -y, z), point C at (-x, y, -z), and point D at (x, -y, -z). This kind of symmetric placement might satisfy the equal opposite edges.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to place the points such that the midpoints of AB and CD coincide, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using vectors. Let me denote vectors a, b, c for points A, B, C, D.\n\nWait, another idea: in a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, the volume can be calculated using the formula V = (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) )) / (6*sqrt(2)) )\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that formula applies here. Maybe that's for a different case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron is orthocentric, given the symmetry.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the volume using Heron's formula on each face and then use some relation, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume by splitting the tetrahedron into two parts, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal. I think there's a formula that if all opposite edges are equal, the volume is sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / (6*sqrt(2)) )\n\nWait, let me check: For a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = CD = a, AC = BD = b, AD = BC = c, the volume is given by V = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / (6*sqrt(2)) )\n\nIs that correct? I think that's the formula for a tetrahedron with three pairs of opposite edges equal, which is our case.\n\nSo, let's apply that formula.\n\nGiven:\n\nAB=CD=\u221a41, so a\u00b2=41\n\nAC=BD=\u221a80, so b\u00b2=80\n\nAD=BC=\u221a89, so c\u00b2=89\n\nCompute the terms:\n\nFirst term: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 =41 +80 -89=32\n\nSecond term: a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2=41 +89 -80=50\n\nThird term: b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2=80 +89 -41=128\n\nSo, V= sqrt(32 *50 *128) / (6*sqrt(2)).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n32*50=1600; 1600*128=204800.\n\nSo, sqrt(204800)=sqrt(2048 *100)=sqrt(2048)*10.\n\nsqrt(2048)=sqrt(1024*2)=32*sqrt(2).\n\nSo, sqrt(204800)=32*sqrt(2)*10=320*sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, V=320*sqrt(2)/(6*sqrt(2))=320/6=160/3.\n\nWait, that's much simpler! So, the volume is 160/3.\n\nWait, let me recheck the formula. I think the formula for the volume when opposite edges are equal is indeed V = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / (6*sqrt(2)) )\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n(32)(50)(128)=204800.\n\nsqrt(204800)=sqrt(204800)= approximately 452.548... but exact value is 320*sqrt(2) because 320^2=102400, and 204800=2*102400.\n\nWait, 320^2=102400, so 320*sqrt(2)^2= (320)^2 *2=102400*2=204800. So, sqrt(204800)=320*sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, V=320*sqrt(2)/(6*sqrt(2))=320/6=160/3.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, volume V=160/3.\n\nThis is a much better approach than computing the Cayley-Menger determinant manually. So, I should have thought of this earlier.\n\nNow, moving on to compute the total surface area S.\n\nEach face of the tetrahedron is a triangle with sides of lengths given. Let's compute the area of each face and sum them up.\n\nGiven the edge lengths, each face is a triangle with sides:\n\nFor face ABC: AB=\u221a41, AC=\u221a80, BC=\u221a89\n\nSimilarly, face ABD: AB=\u221a41, AD=\u221a89, BD=\u221a80\n\nFace ACD: AC=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89, CD=\u221a41\n\nFace BCD: BC=\u221a89, BD=\u221a80, CD=\u221a41\n\nSo, each face is a triangle with sides (\u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89). Since all four faces are congruent triangles, each face has the same area.\n\nSo, compute the area of one face and multiply by 4.\n\nCompute area of triangle with sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nUse Heron's formula.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s=(a + b + c)/2.\n\ns=(\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute using the formula with squares.\n\nAlternatively, since the sides are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), perhaps it's a right triangle?\n\nCheck if a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2.\n\nCompute 41 +80=121, which is 11\u00b2, but c\u00b2=89, which is less than 121. So, no, not a right triangle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute the area using Heron's formula.\n\nCompute s=(sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.\n\nBut this would be messy. Alternatively, use the formula for area given three sides:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nBut this is Heron's formula.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLet me compute the product inside the sqrt.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\na\u00b2=41, b\u00b2=80, c\u00b2=89.\n\nCompute:\n\n(a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (a + b + c)\n\nSecond term: (-a + b + c)= (b + c -a)\n\nThird term: (a - b + c)= (a + c -b)\n\nFourth term: (a + b -c)= (a + b -c)\n\nCompute the product:\n\n[(a + b + c)(-a + b + c)] = [(b + c)^2 -a\u00b2] = (b\u00b2 + 2bc + c\u00b2) -a\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, [(a - b + c)(a + b -c)] = [a\u00b2 - (b -c)^2] = a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2 - 2bc + c\u00b2)\n\nSo, the product becomes:\n\n[ (b\u00b2 + 2bc + c\u00b2 -a\u00b2) * (a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 + 2bc -c\u00b2) ]\n\nLet me compute each bracket:\n\nFirst bracket: b\u00b2 +2bc +c\u00b2 -a\u00b2 =80 + 2*sqrt(80*89) +89 -41= (80+89-41) + 2*sqrt(7120)= 128 + 2*sqrt(7120)\n\nSecond bracket: a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 +2bc -c\u00b2=41 -80 +2*sqrt(80*89) -89= (41-80-89) +2*sqrt(7120)= (-128) +2*sqrt(7120)\n\nSo, the product is:\n\n[128 + 2*sqrt(7120)] * [ -128 + 2*sqrt(7120) ]\n\nThis is of the form (x)(y) where x = A + B, y = -A + B, with A=128, B=2*sqrt(7120).\n\nSo, x*y = (-A\u00b2 + B\u00b2).\n\nCompute:\n\n(-128\u00b2 + (2*sqrt(7120))\u00b2 )= -16384 +4*7120= -16384 +28480=12096.\n\nSo, the product inside the sqrt is 12096.\n\nTherefore, area = (1/4)*sqrt(12096).\n\nCompute sqrt(12096):\n\nFactor 12096:\n\nDivide by 16: 12096 \u00f716=756\n\n756=36*21=36*3*7.\n\nSo, sqrt(12096)=sqrt(16*756)=4*sqrt(756)=4*sqrt(36*21)=4*6*sqrt(21)=24*sqrt(21).\n\nSo, area= (1/4)*24*sqrt(21)=6*sqrt(21).\n\nTherefore, each face has area 6*sqrt(21). Since there are four faces, total surface area S=4*6*sqrt(21)=24*sqrt(21).\n\nNow, compute the inradius r= 3V / S.\n\nGiven V=160/3, S=24*sqrt(21).\n\nSo,\n\nr= 3*(160/3) / (24*sqrt(21)) = 160 / (24*sqrt(21)) = (160/24) / sqrt(21) = (20/3)/sqrt(21) = (20)/(3*sqrt(21)).\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\nr= (20*sqrt(21))/(3*21)= (20*sqrt(21))/(63).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator: 20 and 63 are coprime, so the fraction is in simplest terms.\n\nTherefore, r= (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nCheck if m and p are coprime: 20 and 63 share no common factors besides 1. Yes.\n\nCheck if n is square-free: 21 factors into 3*7, which are primes, so yes.\n\nSo, m + n + p=20 +21 +63=104.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given with specific lengths: AB and CD are both \u221a41, AC and BD are \u221a80, and BC and AD are \u221a89. I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer should be in the form m\u221an/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, I have to find m + n + p.\n\nHmm, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula similar to the 2D case with triangles, but it involves the volume and the surface area. Specifically, the formula is r = 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. Wait, is that right? Let me think. In 3D, the inradius is the radius of the sphere tangent to all faces, so the volume can be expressed as (1/3) * surface area * inradius. Therefore, inradius r = 3V / S_total, yes.\n\nSo, my plan is to first compute the volume V of the tetrahedron, then compute the total surface area S, and then plug them into r = 3V / S.\n\nBut to compute the volume, I might need coordinates for the vertices. Since the given edge lengths have a sort of symmetry (opposite edges are equal), maybe the tetrahedron is \"isohedral\" or has some symmetry that I can exploit to assign coordinates.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the vertices. Let's put point A at (0, 0, 0). Then, let me assign coordinates to other points such that the edge lengths are satisfied.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to realize that such a tetrahedron is a \"disphemoid\" or something similar, where opposite edges are equal. I think in such cases, the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system where the coordinates are symmetric.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron given the lengths of its edges. There's a formula called the Cayley-Menger determinant which can compute the volume based on all the edge lengths. Maybe that's the way to go, especially since the edge lengths are all given.\n\nYes, let's recall the Cayley-Menger determinant. For a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f, the volume V is given by:\n\nV = sqrt( CM / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   a\u00b2   b\u00b2   c\u00b2 |\n| 1  a\u00b2   0    d\u00b2   e\u00b2 |\n| 1  b\u00b2  d\u00b2    0    f\u00b2 |\n| 1  c\u00b2  e\u00b2   f\u00b2    0  |\n\nSo, I need to plug in the given edge lengths into this matrix and compute the determinant.\n\nGiven the edge lengths:\n\nAB = sqrt(41) => a\u00b2 = 41\nAC = sqrt(80) => b\u00b2 = 80\nAD = sqrt(89) => c\u00b2 = 89\nBC = sqrt(89) => d\u00b2 = 89\nBD = sqrt(80) => e\u00b2 = 80\nCD = sqrt(41) => f\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo, the Cayley-Menger matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nNow, I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. That's going to be a bit involved, but let's proceed step by step.\n\nLet me denote the Cayley-Menger matrix as M:\n\nM = [\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n[1, 0, 41, 80, 89],\n[1, 41, 0, 89, 80],\n[1, 80, 89, 0, 41],\n[1, 89, 80, 41, 0]\n]\n\nCalculating the determinant of a 5x5 matrix is quite tedious. Maybe I can find some pattern or symmetry to simplify it.\n\nLooking at the matrix, it's symmetric across the main diagonal, except for the first row and column. Wait, actually, it's symmetric because all the off-diagonal elements in the lower triangle mirror those in the upper triangle.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a way to exploit that symmetry. Alternatively, maybe I can perform row or column operations to simplify the determinant.\n\nLet me consider expanding the determinant along the first row. The determinant would be:\n\n0 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor)\n\nBut since the first element is 0, that term drops out. So,\n\ndet(M) = -1 * det(M1) + 1 * det(M2) -1 * det(M3) +1 * det(M4)\n\nWhere M1, M2, M3, M4 are the minors corresponding to the elements in the first row (excluding the first element, which is 0).\n\nWait, actually, the cofactor expansion along the first row would be:\n\nsum_{j=1 to 5} (-1)^{1+j} * M[0][j] * det(Minor[0][j])\n\nSince M[0][0] is 0, that term is zero. The rest:\n\nj=1: (-1)^{1+1} * 1 * det(Minor[0][1])\nj=2: (-1)^{1+2} * 1 * det(Minor[0][2])\nj=3: (-1)^{1+3} * 1 * det(Minor[0][3])\nj=4: (-1)^{1+4} * 1 * det(Minor[0][4])\nj=5: (-1)^{1+5} * 1 * det(Minor[0][5])\n\nWait, but the first row is [0,1,1,1,1], so the minors are for the positions (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5). But in a 5x5 matrix, indices go from 0 to 4, so perhaps I have a typo here. Let me correct.\n\nWait, the first row is index 0, and the columns are 0 to 4. So, j runs from 0 to 4.\n\nSo, the determinant expansion along the first row (index 0) is:\n\nsum_{j=0 to 4} (-1)^{0+j} * M[0][j] * det(Minor[0][j])\n\nWhich is:\n\nM[0][0] * det(...) - M[0][1] * det(...) + M[0][2] * det(...) - M[0][3] * det(...) + M[0][4] * det(...)\n\nBut M[0][0] is 0, so the first term is zero.\n\nSo, det(M) = -1 * det(M1) + 1 * det(M2) -1 * det(M3) +1 * det(M4)\n\nWhere:\n\nM1 is the minor for (0,1), which is the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing row 0 and column 1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo, let's compute each minor.\n\nFirst, Minor M1: remove row 0 and column 1.\n\nOriginal rows (excluding row 0):\n\nRow1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nSo, removing column 1 (index 1) from each row:\n\nRow1 becomes: [1, 41, 80, 89]\n\nWait no, original columns are 0 to 4. So removing column 1, we have columns 0, 2, 3, 4.\n\nWait, row1 is [1,0,41,80,89]. Removing column1 (which is index1, the second element), the new row is [1,41,80,89].\n\nSimilarly, row2 is [1,41,0,89,80]. Removing column1: [1,0,89,80]\n\nRow3: [1,80,89,0,41]. Removing column1: [1,89,0,41]\n\nRow4: [1,89,80,41,0]. Removing column1: [1,80,41,0]\n\nSo, minor M1 is the 4x4 matrix:\n\n[\n[1,41,80,89],\n[1,0,89,80],\n[1,89,0,41],\n[1,80,41,0]\n]\n\nSimilarly, compute the determinant of this matrix.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can compute the determinant numerically, but perhaps there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can subtract rows to create zeros.\n\nLet me denote minor M1 as:\n\nRow1: 1,41,80,89\n\nRow2: 1,0,89,80\n\nRow3: 1,89,0,41\n\nRow4: 1,80,41,0\n\nLet me subtract Row1 from Row2, Row3, Row4.\n\nRow2_new = Row2 - Row1:\n\n1-1=0, 0-41=-41, 89-80=9, 80-89=-9\n\nRow3_new = Row3 - Row1:\n\n1-1=0, 89-41=48, 0-80=-80, 41-89=-48\n\nRow4_new = Row4 - Row1:\n\n1-1=0, 80-41=39, 41-80=-39, 0-89=-89\n\nSo, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow1: 1,41,80,89\n\nRow2: 0,-41,9,-9\n\nRow3: 0,48,-80,-48\n\nRow4: 0,39,-39,-89\n\nNow, since the first column has 1 followed by zeros, it's easier to compute the determinant by expanding along the first column.\n\nThe determinant of M1 is equal to the determinant of the 4x4 matrix above.\n\nExpanding along the first column, which is [1,0,0,0], the determinant is 1 * det of the minor obtained by removing row1 and column1.\n\nSo, the minor is the 3x3 matrix:\n\nRow2: -41,9,-9\n\nRow3: 48,-80,-48\n\nRow4: 39,-39,-89\n\nNow, compute the determinant of this 3x3 matrix.\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\n| -41   9    -9  |\n| 48  -80  -48  |\n| 39  -39  -89  |\n\nCompute this determinant.\n\nI'll use the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion.\n\nLet's compute it as:\n\n-41 * [(-80)(-89) - (-48)(-39)] - 9 * [48*(-89) - (-48)*39] + (-9) * [48*(-39) - (-80)*39]\n\nCompute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: -41 * [ (80*89) - (48*39) ]\n\nCompute 80*89: 80*90=7200 minus 80=7120.\n\n48*39: 48*(40-1)=1920 -48=1872.\n\nSo, first term: -41 * (7120 - 1872) = -41*(5248) = Let's compute 41*5248.\n\nWait, 41 * 5000 = 205000, 41*248= 41*(200+48)=8200 + 1968=10168. So total is 205000 +10168=215168. So first term is -215168.\n\nSecond term: -9 * [48*(-89) - (-48)*39]\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n48*(-89) = -4272\n\n-48*(-39) = +1872\n\nSo, -4272 +1872 = -2400.\n\nMultiply by -9: -9*(-2400) = +21600.\n\nThird term: (-9) * [48*(-39) - (-80)*39]\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n48*(-39) = -1872\n\n-80*(-39) = +3120\n\nSo, -1872 +3120 = 1248.\n\nMultiply by (-9): (-9)*1248 = -11232.\n\nSo, adding all three terms:\n\nFirst term: -215168\n\nSecond term: +21600\n\nThird term: -11232\n\nTotal: (-215168) + 21600 = (-193568) + (-11232) = -204800.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\n-215168 + 21600 = (-215168 + 21600) = (-193568). Then, -193568 -11232 = (-204800). So determinant of the 3x3 matrix is -204800.\n\nBut wait, wait, the determinant is computed as:\n\n= -41*(5248) -9*(-2400) + (-9)*(1248)\n\nWhich is:\n\n-215168 +21600 -11232.\n\nWait, that would be:\n\n-215168 +21600 = -193568\n\nThen, -193568 -11232 = -204800.\n\nSo, the determinant is -204800.\n\nBut wait, that seems very large. Let me verify the calculations step by step.\n\nFirst term: -41*(7120 - 1872) = -41*(5248) = -41*5248.\n\nCompute 5248 *40=209920, 5248*1=5248, so total 209920 +5248=215168. So yes, -215168.\n\nSecond term: -9*[48*(-89) - (-48)*39] = -9*(-4272 +1872) = -9*(-2400)= +21600.\n\nThird term: (-9)*[48*(-39) - (-80)*39] = (-9)*(-1872 +3120) = (-9)*(1248)= -11232.\n\nAdding up: -215168 +21600 = -193568; -193568 -11232= -204800.\n\nSo yes, the determinant is -204800.\n\nTherefore, the determinant of minor M1 is -204800.\n\nBut wait, no, that's the determinant of the 3x3 matrix, which was the minor after expanding. So the determinant of the 4x4 matrix (minor M1) is 1 * (-204800) = -204800.\n\nWait, no, when you expand the 4x4 determinant, you get 1 multiplied by the determinant of the 3x3 matrix, which is -204800. So det(M1) = -204800.\n\nHmm, but let me think again: when we subtracted Row1 from the other rows, the determinant of the 4x4 matrix is the same as the determinant of the transformed matrix because we performed row operations that don't change the determinant (since we subtracted rows, which is adding a multiple of a row, so determinant remains same).\n\nSo, the determinant of minor M1 is -204800.\n\nNow, moving on to compute the determinant of minor M2.\n\nWait, this is getting really time-consuming, but let me try to proceed.\n\nMinor M2 is the minor for element (0,2), which is the element in row 0, column 2, which is 1. So, we remove row 0 and column 2.\n\nOriginal matrix M:\n\nRow0: 0,1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow2:1,41,0,89,80\n\nRow3:1,80,89,0,41\n\nRow4:1,89,80,41,0\n\nSo, removing row 0 and column 2, the minor M2 is the 4x4 matrix:\n\nRow1: 1,0,80,89\n\nRow2:1,41,89,80\n\nRow3:1,80,0,41\n\nRow4:1,89,41,0\n\nWait, let me double-check. Removing column 2 (index 2, which is the third element) from each row:\n\nRow1: [1,0,80,89] (since original row1 is [1,0,41,80,89])\n\nRow2: [1,41,89,80]\n\nRow3: [1,80,0,41]\n\nRow4: [1,89,41,0]\n\nSo, the minor M2 is:\n\n[\n[1,0,80,89],\n[1,41,89,80],\n[1,80,0,41],\n[1,89,41,0]\n]\n\nNow, compute det(M2).\n\nAgain, perhaps perform row operations to simplify.\n\nSubtract Row1 from Row2, Row3, Row4.\n\nRow2_new = Row2 - Row1: [0,41,9,-9]\n\nRow3_new = Row3 - Row1: [0,80,-80,-48]\n\nRow4_new = Row4 - Row1: [0,89,-41,-89]\n\nSo, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow1: [1,0,80,89]\n\nRow2: [0,41,9,-9]\n\nRow3: [0,80,-80,-48]\n\nRow4: [0,89,-41,-89]\n\nAgain, expand the determinant along the first column, which is [1,0,0,0], so the determinant is 1 * det of the minor obtained by removing Row1 and Column1.\n\nThe minor is the 3x3 matrix:\n\nRow2:41,9,-9\n\nRow3:80,-80,-48\n\nRow4:89,-41,-89\n\nCompute determinant of this matrix.\n\nAgain, using the same method.\n\nCompute:\n\n41 * [ (-80)(-89) - (-48)(-41) ] - 9 * [80*(-89) - (-48)*89 ] + (-9) * [80*(-41) - (-80)*89 ]\n\nCompute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term:41*(7120 - 1968)=41*(5152)= Let's compute 41*5000=205000, 41*152=6232, so total 205000+6232=211232.\n\nSecond term: -9*( -7120 + 4272 )= -9*(-2848)= +25632.\n\nThird term: (-9)*( -3280 + 7120 )= (-9)*(3840)= -34560.\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n211232 +25632 = 236864; 236864 -34560=202304.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nFirst term:41*(7120 - 1968)=41*5152=211232.\n\nSecond term: -9*(80*(-89) - (-48)*89)= -9*(-7120 +4272)= -9*(-2848)=25632.\n\nThird term: (-9)*(80*(-41) - (-80)*89)= (-9)*(-3280 +7120)= (-9)*(3840)= -34560.\n\nSo, 211232 +25632=236864; 236864 -34560=202304.\n\nSo, the determinant of this 3x3 matrix is 202304.\n\nTherefore, the determinant of minor M2 is 1 * 202304 = 202304.\n\nProceeding similarly, compute det(M3), which is the minor for (0,3). Let's see.\n\nMinor M3 is obtained by removing row 0 and column 3.\n\nSo, the original matrix M:\n\nRow0:0,1,1,1,1\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow2:1,41,0,89,80\n\nRow3:1,80,89,0,41\n\nRow4:1,89,80,41,0\n\nRemoving column 3 (index3, which is the fourth element), so from each row:\n\nRow1: [1,0,41,89]\n\nRow2: [1,41,0,80]\n\nRow3: [1,80,89,41]\n\nRow4: [1,89,80,0]\n\nSo, minor M3 is:\n\n[\n[1,0,41,89],\n[1,41,0,80],\n[1,80,89,41],\n[1,89,80,0]\n]\n\nCompute determinant of this 4x4 matrix.\n\nAgain, perhaps perform row operations. Subtract Row1 from Row2, Row3, Row4.\n\nRow2_new = Row2 - Row1: [0,41,-41,-9]\n\nRow3_new = Row3 - Row1: [0,80,48,-48]\n\nRow4_new = Row4 - Row1: [0,89,39,-89]\n\nSo, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow1: [1,0,41,89]\n\nRow2: [0,41,-41,-9]\n\nRow3: [0,80,48,-48]\n\nRow4: [0,89,39,-89]\n\nAgain, expand the determinant along the first column, which is [1,0,0,0], so the determinant is 1 * det of the minor.\n\nThe minor is the 3x3 matrix:\n\nRow2:41,-41,-9\n\nRow3:80,48,-48\n\nRow4:89,39,-89\n\nCompute determinant:\n\n41 * [48*(-89) - (-48)*39] - (-41) * [80*(-89) - (-48)*89] + (-9) * [80*39 -48*89]\n\nCompute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term:41*( -4272 + 1872 )=41*(-2400)= -98400.\n\nSecond term: -(-41)*( -7120 +4272 )=41*(-2848)= -116768.\n\nWait, wait, let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst term: 41*( [48*(-89) - (-48)*39] )\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n48*(-89)= -4272\n\n(-48)*39= -1872\n\nSo, 48*(-89) - (-48)*39 = -4272 +1872= -2400.\n\nSo, first term:41*(-2400)= -98400.\n\nSecond term: -(-41)*[80*(-89) - (-48)*89]\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n80*(-89)= -7120\n\n(-48)*89= -4272\n\nSo, 80*(-89) - (-48)*89= -7120 +4272= -2848.\n\nMultiply by -(-41)=41: 41*(-2848)= -116768.\n\nThird term: (-9)*[80*39 -48*89]\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n80*39=3120\n\n48*89=4272\n\nSo, 3120 -4272= -1152.\n\nMultiply by (-9): (-9)*(-1152)=10368.\n\nNow, sum all three terms:\n\n-98400 -116768 +10368.\n\nCompute:\n\n-98400 -116768= -215168\n\n-215168 +10368= -204800.\n\nSo, the determinant of the 3x3 matrix is -204800.\n\nTherefore, the determinant of minor M3 is 1*(-204800)= -204800.\n\nMoving on to minor M4, which is the minor for (0,4), meaning removing row 0 and column4.\n\nSo, from the original matrix M, remove row0 and column4:\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80\n\nRow2:1,41,0,89\n\nRow3:1,80,89,0\n\nRow4:1,89,80,41\n\nSo, minor M4 is:\n\n[\n[1,0,41,80],\n[1,41,0,89],\n[1,80,89,0],\n[1,89,80,41]\n]\n\nCompute determinant of this 4x4 matrix.\n\nAgain, perform row operations. Subtract Row1 from Row2, Row3, Row4.\n\nRow2_new = Row2 - Row1: [0,41,-41,9]\n\nRow3_new = Row3 - Row1: [0,80,48,-80]\n\nRow4_new = Row4 - Row1: [0,89,39,-39]\n\nSo, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow1: [1,0,41,80]\n\nRow2: [0,41,-41,9]\n\nRow3: [0,80,48,-80]\n\nRow4: [0,89,39,-39]\n\nAgain, expanding along the first column [1,0,0,0], determinant is 1 * det of the minor.\n\nThe minor is the 3x3 matrix:\n\nRow2:41,-41,9\n\nRow3:80,48,-80\n\nRow4:89,39,-39\n\nCompute determinant.\n\n41*(48*(-39) - (-80)*39) - (-41)*(80*(-39) - (-80)*89) +9*(80*39 -48*89)\n\nCompute each term.\n\nFirst term:41*( -1872 + 3120 )=41*(1248)=51168.\n\nSecond term: -(-41)*( -3120 +7120 )=41*(4000)=164000.\n\nWait, wait, let's go step by step.\n\nFirst term:41*(48*(-39) - (-80)*39)\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n48*(-39)= -1872\n\n(-80)*39= -3120\n\nWait, wait, no: the expression is 48*(-39) - (-80)*39 = -1872 +3120=1248.\n\nSo, 41*1248=51168.\n\nSecond term: -(-41)*(80*(-39) - (-80)*89)\n\nInside the brackets:\n\n80*(-39)= -3120\n\n(-80)*89= -7120\n\nSo, 80*(-39) - (-80)*89= -3120 +7120=4000.\n\nMultiply by -(-41)=41: 41*4000=164000.\n\nThird term:9*(80*39 -48*89)\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n80*39=3120\n\n48*89=4272\n\nSo, 3120 -4272= -1152.\n\nMultiply by 9: 9*(-1152)= -10368.\n\nNow, sum all terms:\n\n51168 +164000=215168; 215168 -10368=204800.\n\nSo, the determinant of the 3x3 matrix is 204800.\n\nTherefore, determinant of minor M4 is 1*204800=204800.\n\nNow, going back to the original expansion of the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\ndet(M) = -det(M1) + det(M2) - det(M3) + det(M4)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ndet(M) = -(-204800) + 202304 - (-204800) +204800\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-(-204800)= +204800\n\n+202304\n\n-(-204800)= +204800\n\n+204800\n\nSo, adding all together:\n\n204800 +202304=407104\n\n407104 +204800=611904\n\n611904 +204800=816704\n\nSo, det(M)=816704.\n\nWait, that seems very large. Let me check the signs again.\n\ndet(M) = -det(M1) + det(M2) - det(M3) + det(M4)\n\nWhich is:\n\n-(-204800) = +204800\n\n+202304\n\n-(-204800)= +204800\n\n+204800\n\nSo, yes, 204800 +202304=407104\n\n407104 +204800=611904\n\n611904 +204800=816704.\n\nSo, det(M)=816704.\n\nWait, but the Cayley-Menger determinant is supposed to be positive? Or can it be negative? I think it's squared in the volume formula, so maybe the sign doesn't matter.\n\nWait, the volume is sqrt( |det(M)| / 288 ). Because the determinant can be negative, but the volume is positive.\n\nSo, |det(M)| = 816704.\n\nTherefore, V = sqrt(816704 / 288 )\n\nCompute 816704 /288.\n\nLet me compute 816704 \u00f7 288.\n\nFirst, note that 288=16*18.\n\nLet me compute 816704 \u00f7 16=51043. So, 816704 \u00f7 288=51043 \u00f718.\n\nCompute 51043 \u00f718:\n\n18*2835=51030. 51043 -51030=13. So, 2835 +13/18=2835.7222...\n\nBut perhaps we can factor 816704 and 288 to simplify the fraction.\n\nFactor 816704:\n\nDivide by 16: 816704 \u00f716=51044.\n\nWait, wait, 16*51044=816,704.\n\n51044: Let's factor further.\n\n51044 \u00f74=12761.\n\n12761: Let me check divisibility. 12761 \u00f77= 1823, which is prime? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 12761 is 12761.\n\nWait, perhaps 12761 is a square? Let me see: 113\u00b2=12769, which is higher. 112\u00b2=12544. So, not a perfect square.\n\nSo, 816704=16 *4 *12761=64 *12761.\n\nSimilarly, 288=16*18=16*2*9=32*9.\n\nSo, 816704 /288= (64*12761)/(32*9)= (2*12761)/9=25522/9.\n\nSo, 816704 /288=25522/9.\n\nSo, V= sqrt(25522/9)=sqrt(25522)/3.\n\nWait, but 25522 is even, so divide by 2:25522=2*12761.\n\nSo, sqrt(25522)=sqrt(2*12761).\n\nHmm, is 12761 a square? Let's check: 113\u00b2=12769, which is 8 more than 12761. So, 12761 is not a perfect square.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.\n\nWait, 816704 /288= (816704 \u00f716)=51044; 51044 \u00f718=51044/18=2835.777...\n\nWait, 2835.777... is 2835 and 7/9, but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps my earlier computation of the determinant is wrong. Let me check.\n\nWait, this is taking too long. Maybe I should double-check the Cayley-Menger determinant calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute the volume. Since the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, perhaps it's a \"equifacial\" tetrahedron or something similar, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: since all opposite edges are equal, the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system such that the coordinates are symmetric.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the vertices such that:\n\nLet\u2019s place the points as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let point A be at (x, y, z), point B at (-x, -y, z), point C at (-x, y, -z), and point D at (x, -y, -z). This kind of symmetric placement might satisfy the equal opposite edges.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to place the points such that the midpoints of AB and CD coincide, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using vectors. Let me denote vectors a, b, c for points A, B, C, D.\n\nWait, another idea: in a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, the volume can be calculated using the formula V = (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) )) / (6*sqrt(2)) )\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that formula applies here. Maybe that's for a different case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron is orthocentric, given the symmetry.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the volume using Heron's formula on each face and then use some relation, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume by splitting the tetrahedron into two parts, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal. I think there's a formula that if all opposite edges are equal, the volume is sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / (6*sqrt(2)) )\n\nWait, let me check: For a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = CD = a, AC = BD = b, AD = BC = c, the volume is given by V = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / (6*sqrt(2)) )\n\nIs that correct? I think that's the formula for a tetrahedron with three pairs of opposite edges equal, which is our case.\n\nSo, let's apply that formula.\n\nGiven:\n\nAB=CD=\u221a41, so a\u00b2=41\n\nAC=BD=\u221a80, so b\u00b2=80\n\nAD=BC=\u221a89, so c\u00b2=89\n\nCompute the terms:\n\nFirst term: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 =41 +80 -89=32\n\nSecond term: a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2=41 +89 -80=50\n\nThird term: b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2=80 +89 -41=128\n\nSo, V= sqrt(32 *50 *128) / (6*sqrt(2)).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n32*50=1600; 1600*128=204800.\n\nSo, sqrt(204800)=sqrt(2048 *100)=sqrt(2048)*10.\n\nsqrt(2048)=sqrt(1024*2)=32*sqrt(2).\n\nSo, sqrt(204800)=32*sqrt(2)*10=320*sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, V=320*sqrt(2)/(6*sqrt(2))=320/6=160/3.\n\nWait, that's much simpler! So, the volume is 160/3.\n\nWait, let me recheck the formula. I think the formula for the volume when opposite edges are equal is indeed V = sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) ) / (6*sqrt(2)) )\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n(32)(50)(128)=204800.\n\nsqrt(204800)=sqrt(204800)= approximately 452.548... but exact value is 320*sqrt(2) because 320^2=102400, and 204800=2*102400.\n\nWait, 320^2=102400, so 320*sqrt(2)^2= (320)^2 *2=102400*2=204800. So, sqrt(204800)=320*sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, V=320*sqrt(2)/(6*sqrt(2))=320/6=160/3.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, volume V=160/3.\n\nThis is a much better approach than computing the Cayley-Menger determinant manually. So, I should have thought of this earlier.\n\nNow, moving on to compute the total surface area S.\n\nEach face of the tetrahedron is a triangle with sides of lengths given. Let's compute the area of each face and sum them up.\n\nGiven the edge lengths, each face is a triangle with sides:\n\nFor face ABC: AB=\u221a41, AC=\u221a80, BC=\u221a89\n\nSimilarly, face ABD: AB=\u221a41, AD=\u221a89, BD=\u221a80\n\nFace ACD: AC=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89, CD=\u221a41\n\nFace BCD: BC=\u221a89, BD=\u221a80, CD=\u221a41\n\nSo, each face is a triangle with sides (\u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89). Since all four faces are congruent triangles, each face has the same area.\n\nSo, compute the area of one face and multiply by 4.\n\nCompute area of triangle with sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nUse Heron's formula.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s=(a + b + c)/2.\n\ns=(\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute using the formula with squares.\n\nAlternatively, since the sides are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), perhaps it's a right triangle?\n\nCheck if a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2.\n\nCompute 41 +80=121, which is 11\u00b2, but c\u00b2=89, which is less than 121. So, no, not a right triangle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute the area using Heron's formula.\n\nCompute s=(sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.\n\nBut this would be messy. Alternatively, use the formula for area given three sides:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nBut this is Heron's formula.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLet me compute the product inside the sqrt.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\na\u00b2=41, b\u00b2=80, c\u00b2=89.\n\nCompute:\n\n(a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (a + b + c)\n\nSecond term: (-a + b + c)= (b + c -a)\n\nThird term: (a - b + c)= (a + c -b)\n\nFourth term: (a + b -c)= (a + b -c)\n\nCompute the product:\n\n[(a + b + c)(-a + b + c)] = [(b + c)^2 -a\u00b2] = (b\u00b2 + 2bc + c\u00b2) -a\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, [(a - b + c)(a + b -c)] = [a\u00b2 - (b -c)^2] = a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2 - 2bc + c\u00b2)\n\nSo, the product becomes:\n\n[ (b\u00b2 + 2bc + c\u00b2 -a\u00b2) * (a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 + 2bc -c\u00b2) ]\n\nLet me compute each bracket:\n\nFirst bracket: b\u00b2 +2bc +c\u00b2 -a\u00b2 =80 + 2*sqrt(80*89) +89 -41= (80+89-41) + 2*sqrt(7120)= 128 + 2*sqrt(7120)\n\nSecond bracket: a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 +2bc -c\u00b2=41 -80 +2*sqrt(80*89) -89= (41-80-89) +2*sqrt(7120)= (-128) +2*sqrt(7120)\n\nSo, the product is:\n\n[128 + 2*sqrt(7120)] * [ -128 + 2*sqrt(7120) ]\n\nThis is of the form (x)(y) where x = A + B, y = -A + B, with A=128, B=2*sqrt(7120).\n\nSo, x*y = (-A\u00b2 + B\u00b2).\n\nCompute:\n\n(-128\u00b2 + (2*sqrt(7120))\u00b2 )= -16384 +4*7120= -16384 +28480=12096.\n\nSo, the product inside the sqrt is 12096.\n\nTherefore, area = (1/4)*sqrt(12096).\n\nCompute sqrt(12096):\n\nFactor 12096:\n\nDivide by 16: 12096 \u00f716=756\n\n756=36*21=36*3*7.\n\nSo, sqrt(12096)=sqrt(16*756)=4*sqrt(756)=4*sqrt(36*21)=4*6*sqrt(21)=24*sqrt(21).\n\nSo, area= (1/4)*24*sqrt(21)=6*sqrt(21).\n\nTherefore, each face has area 6*sqrt(21). Since there are four faces, total surface area S=4*6*sqrt(21)=24*sqrt(21).\n\nNow, compute the inradius r= 3V / S.\n\nGiven V=160/3, S=24*sqrt(21).\n\nSo,\n\nr= 3*(160/3) / (24*sqrt(21)) = 160 / (24*sqrt(21)) = (160/24) / sqrt(21) = (20/3)/sqrt(21) = (20)/(3*sqrt(21)).\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\nr= (20*sqrt(21))/(3*21)= (20*sqrt(21))/(63).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator: 20 and 63 are coprime, so the fraction is in simplest terms.\n\nTherefore, r= (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nCheck if m and p are coprime: 20 and 63 share no common factors besides 1. Yes.\n\nCheck if n is square-free: 21 factors into 3*7, which are primes, so yes.\n\nSo, m + n + p=20 +21 +63=104.\n\n\nThe given tetrahedron has opposite edges equal: \\(AB = CD = \\sqrt{41}\\), \\(AC = BD = \\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(BC = AD = \\sqrt{89}\\). To find the inradius \\(r\\), we use the formula \\(r = \\frac{3V}{S}\\), where \\(V\\) is the volume and \\(S\\) is the total surface area.\n\nFirst, we compute the volume \\(V\\) using the formula for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{\\sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)}}{6\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(a^2 = 41\\), \\(b^2 = 80\\), and \\(c^2 = 89\\):\n\\[\nV = \\frac{\\sqrt{(41 + 80 - 89)(41 + 89 - 80)(80 + 89 - 41)}}{6\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{32 \\cdot 50 \\cdot 128}}{6\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{320\\sqrt{2}}{6\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{160}{3}\n\\]\n\nNext, we compute the total surface area \\(S\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem about a tetrahedron. Let me try to visualize it first. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces, and in this case, the edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). So, it seems like the opposite edges are equal. That probably means it's a kind of symmetric tetrahedron, maybe called isosceles or something?\n\nThe problem mentions a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. I remember that in a tetrahedron, such a point is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.\n\nTo find the inradius, I think I need to use the formula that relates the volume of the tetrahedron to its inradius and surface area. For a tetrahedron, the formula is Volume = (1/3) * Surface Area * inradius. Wait, actually, no, in a tetrahedron, the formula is Volume = (1/3) * Surface Area * inradius. Hmm, no, wait. Let me recall. For a triangle, the area is (1/2) * perimeter * inradius. For a tetrahedron, the volume is (1/3) times the surface area times the inradius. So, Volume = (1/3) * Surface Area * inradius. So, if I can find the volume and the surface area, I can solve for the inradius.\n\nFirst, I need to compute the volume of the tetrahedron. Since all opposite edges are equal, this tetrahedron is called \"equifacial\" or maybe \"isohedral\"? Wait, no, isohedral means all faces are the same, which might not be the case here. Alternatively, since opposite edges are equal, perhaps it's a special kind of tetrahedron. I think it might be a disphenoid, where opposite edges are equal. Yes, that sounds familiar.\n\nIn a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles, but wait, in this case, the edges are AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD, so each pair of opposite edges is equal, but the faces might not be congruent. Wait, no, actually, in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent. Let me confirm: a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, and all four faces are congruent. So, in this case, since the opposite edges are equal, perhaps the faces are congruent, making it a disphenoid. So, if it's a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent, which would mean the surface area is four times the area of one face.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the edges are given as AB=CD=\u221a41, AC=BD=\u221a80, and BC=AD=\u221a89. So, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt41, sqrt80, sqrt89? Wait, no, each face is a triangle formed by three edges. Wait, no, each face is a triangle with two edges from one vertex. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. Each face is a triangle, so for example, face ABC has edges AB, BC, and AC. Since AB=\u221a41, BC=\u221a89, and AC=\u221a80, so each face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. So, all four faces are congruent triangles, which would make it a disphenoid.\n\nIf all faces are congruent, then each face has the same area. So, maybe I can compute the area of one face and then multiply by four for the total surface area.\n\nSo, let me compute the area of one face first. Let's take triangle ABC with sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nWait, to compute the area of a triangle with sides a, b, c, I can use Heron's formula. Heron's formula says that the area is sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)], where s is the semi-perimeter: s=(a+b+c)/2.\n\nSo, let's compute s for triangle ABC:\n\na = sqrt41, b = sqrt80, c = sqrt89.\n\nFirst, compute a + b + c:\n\nsqrt41 + sqrt80 + sqrt89.\n\nHmm, sqrt41 is approximately 6.403, sqrt80 is approximately 8.944, sqrt89 is approximately 9.434. So, total is approximately 6.403 + 8.944 + 9.434 \u2248 24.781. So, semi-perimeter s \u2248 24.781 / 2 \u2248 12.3905.\n\nBut I need to compute this exactly, not approximately.\n\nWait, let me square the sides to see if it's a right triangle or something. Let's check if a^2 + b^2 = c^2.\n\na^2 = 41, b^2=80, c^2=89.\n\n41 + 80 = 121, which is not equal to 89, so it's not a right triangle. Hmm.\n\nSo, I need to compute Heron's formula.\n\nCompute s = (sqrt41 + sqrt80 + sqrt89)/2.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe instead of directly computing Heron's formula, I can find the area another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the volume of the tetrahedron first, and then find the inradius.\n\nWait, how else can I compute the volume? Maybe using the Cayley-Menger determinant. I remember that for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, the volume can be computed via the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nVolume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   AB\u00b2 AC\u00b2 AD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AB\u00b2  0   BC\u00b2 BD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AC\u00b2 BC\u00b2  0   CD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AD\u00b2 BD\u00b2 CD\u00b2  0  |\n\nSo, the determinant is a 5x5 matrix, but it's symmetric, so maybe I can compute it step by step.\n\nGiven the edge lengths:\n\nAB = sqrt41 => AB\u00b2 = 41,\n\nAC = sqrt80 => AC\u00b2 = 80,\n\nAD = sqrt89 => AD\u00b2 = 89,\n\nBC = sqrt89 => BC\u00b2 =89,\n\nBD = sqrt80 => BD\u00b2=80,\n\nCD = sqrt41 => CD\u00b2=41.\n\nSo, the CM determinant matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nSo, the determinant is:\n\n| 0  1    1     1     1  |\n| 1  0   41    80    89 |\n| 1 41    0    89    80 |\n| 1 80   89     0    41 |\n| 1 89   80    41     0 |\n\nThis determinant is a bit complicated, but perhaps there's some symmetry here that can help me compute it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the volume of a disphenoid. I think for a disphenoid, the volume can be computed as (sqrt[(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)]) / (6*sqrt(2)), but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, no, maybe that's for a different kind of tetrahedron. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's simpler to use coordinates. Since the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, perhaps I can assign coordinates to the vertices such that the tetrahedron is symmetric.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the tetrahedron. Let's place the points in 3D space such that the midpoints of opposite edges are at the origin or something like that.\n\nWait, let me think. Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron is symmetric with respect to the origin. So, perhaps I can set points A, B, C, D such that A = (x, y, z), B = (-x, -y, z), C = (-x, y, -z), D = (x, -y, -z). Or something like that. Let me check if this setup would give opposite edges equal.\n\nWait, if I set points as A = (a, b, c), B = (-a, -b, c), C = (-a, b, -c), D = (a, -b, -c), then let's compute the distances.\n\nCompute AB: distance between A and B.\n\nA is (a,b,c), B is (-a,-b,c). So,\n\nAB\u00b2 = (a - (-a))\u00b2 + (b - (-b))\u00b2 + (c - c)\u00b2 = (2a)^2 + (2b)^2 + 0 = 4a\u00b2 +4b\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, CD: distance between C and D.\n\nC is (-a,b,-c), D is (a,-b,-c).\n\nCD\u00b2 = ( -a -a )\u00b2 + (b - (-b))\u00b2 + (-c - (-c))\u00b2 = (-2a)^2 + (2b)^2 + 0 = 4a\u00b2 +4b\u00b2.\n\nSo, AB\u00b2 = CD\u00b2 = 4a\u00b2 +4b\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, AC\u00b2: distance between A and C.\n\nA = (a,b,c), C = (-a,b,-c).\n\nAC\u00b2 = (a - (-a))\u00b2 + (b - b)^2 + (c - (-c))\u00b2 = (2a)^2 + 0 + (2c)^2 =4a\u00b2 +4c\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, BD\u00b2: distance between B and D.\n\nB = (-a,-b,c), D = (a,-b,-c).\n\nBD\u00b2 = (-a -a)^2 + (-b - (-b))^2 + (c - (-c))^2 = (-2a)^2 +0 + (2c)^2 =4a\u00b2 +4c\u00b2.\n\nSo, AC\u00b2 = BD\u00b2 =4a\u00b2 +4c\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, BC\u00b2: distance between B and C.\n\nB = (-a,-b,c), C = (-a,b,-c).\n\nBC\u00b2 = (-a - (-a))\u00b2 + (-b - b)^2 + (c - (-c))\u00b2 = 0 + (-2b)^2 + (2c)^2 =4b\u00b2 +4c\u00b2.\n\nAD\u00b2: distance between A and D.\n\nA = (a,b,c), D = (a,-b,-c).\n\nAD\u00b2 = (a -a)^2 + (b - (-b))\u00b2 + (c - (-c))\u00b2 =0 + (2b)^2 + (2c)^2=4b\u00b2 +4c\u00b2.\n\nSo, BC\u00b2 = AD\u00b2 =4b\u00b2 +4c\u00b2.\n\nSo, in this coordinate system, we have AB\u00b2=CD\u00b2=4a\u00b2+4b\u00b2, AC\u00b2=BD\u00b2=4a\u00b2+4c\u00b2, BC\u00b2=AD\u00b2=4b\u00b2+4c\u00b2.\n\nIn our problem, AB\u00b2=41, AC\u00b2=80, BC\u00b2=89.\n\nSo, set up the equations:\n\n4a\u00b2 +4b\u00b2 =41 --> (1)\n\n4a\u00b2 +4c\u00b2=80 --> (2)\n\n4b\u00b2 +4c\u00b2=89 --> (3)\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\n1) a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4\n\n2) a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 80/4 =20\n\n3) b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =89/4\n\nSo, let's write them:\n\nEquation (1): a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4\n\nEquation (2): a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20\n\nEquation (3): b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nSo, we can solve for a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2.\n\nLet me subtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4\n\nc\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (80/4 -41/4) =39/4\n\nSo, c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 =39/4 --> equation (4)\n\nBut from equation (3): b\u00b2 + c\u00b2=89/4.\n\nWe have equation (3): b\u00b2 + c\u00b2=89/4 and equation (4): c\u00b2 - b\u00b2=39/4.\n\nLet me add equations (3) and (4):\n\n( b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 ) + ( c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 ) = 89/4 +39/4\n\n2c\u00b2=128/4=32 --> c\u00b2=16.\n\nSo, c\u00b2=16 --> c=4 or c=-4, but since it's squared, we can take c=4.\n\nThen from equation (4): c\u00b2 - b\u00b2=39/4 -->16 - b\u00b2=39/4 --> b\u00b2=16 -39/4= (64/4 -39/4)=25/4.\n\nSo, b\u00b2=25/4 --> b=5/2 or -5/2.\n\nFrom equation (1): a\u00b2 + b\u00b2=41/4 --> a\u00b2 +25/4=41/4 --> a\u00b2=16/4=4 --> a=2 or -2.\n\nSo, a=2, b=5/2, c=4.\n\nSo, the coordinates are:\n\nA = (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB = (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC = (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nD = (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nWait, let me confirm that. So, according to my earlier assignment:\n\nA = (a, b, c) = (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB = (-a, -b, c) = (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC = (-a, b, -c) = (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nD = (a, -b, -c) = (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nYes, that looks correct.\n\nNow, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron. The volume can be found using the scalar triple product of vectors.\n\nLet's choose one vertex as the origin, say point A. Then vectors AB, AC, AD can be used to compute the volume.\n\nBut wait, in our coordinate system, point A is at (2,5/2,4), so it's not at the origin. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the volume using the determinant formula with coordinates.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with vertices at points A, B, C, D is |det(B - A, C - A, D - A)| / 6.\n\nSo, let's compute vectors B - A, C - A, D - A.\n\nCompute B - A: coordinates of B minus coordinates of A.\n\nB is (-2, -5/2,4), A is (2,5/2,4).\n\nSo, B - A = (-2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, 4 -4) = (-4, -5, 0).\n\nSimilarly, C - A: C is (-2,5/2,-4), A is (2,5/2,4).\n\nSo, C - A = (-2 -2,5/2 -5/2, -4 -4)= (-4, 0, -8).\n\nD - A: D is (2,-5/2,-4), A is (2,5/2,4).\n\nSo, D - A = (2-2, -5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8).\n\nSo, vectors:\n\nu = B - A = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nv = C - A = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nw = D - A = (0, -5, -8)\n\nNow, the scalar triple product is u \u22c5 (v \u00d7 w).\n\nFirst, compute v \u00d7 w.\n\nv \u00d7 w = |i   j    k|\n         |-4   0   -8|\n         |0   -5   -8|\n\nSo, determinant:\n\ni*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) -0*0)\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni: 0*(-8) =0, (-8)*(-5)=40 --> 0 -40 = -40. So, i*(-40)\n\nj: (-4)*(-8)=32, (-8)*0=0 --> 32 -0=32. So, j*(-32) [since it's subtracted]\n\nk: (-4)*(-5)=20, 0*0=0 -->20 -0=20. So, k*(20)\n\nThus, v \u00d7 w = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the cross product formula is:\n\nIf vector v = (v1, v2, v3), w = (w1, w2, w3), then\n\nv \u00d7 w = (v2w3 - v3w2, v3w1 - v1w3, v1w2 - v2w1)\n\nSo, v = (-4,0,-8), w = (0,-5,-8).\n\nCompute:\n\nFirst component: (0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) =0 -40= -40\n\nSecond component: (-8)*0 - (-4)*(-8) =0 -32= -32\n\nThird component: (-4)*(-5) -0*0=20 -0=20\n\nSo, v \u00d7 w = (-40, -32,20)\n\nSo, u \u22c5 (v \u00d7 w) is the dot product of u and this vector.\n\nu is (-4, -5, 0).\n\nDot product:\n\n(-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) +0*20 = 160 +160 +0=320.\n\nSo, scalar triple product is 320. Then the volume is |320| /6 = 320/6 = 160/3.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, Volume = 160/3.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm: the scalar triple product is 320, so the volume is |320| /6 = 320/6=160/3. So, yes.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the Cayley-Menger determinant, but this coordinate method worked out.\n\nNow, moving on to compute the surface area. Since all four faces are congruent triangles, as in a disphenoid, each face has the same area, so the total surface area is four times the area of one face.\n\nSo, let's compute the area of one face, say triangle ABC.\n\nWait, earlier I thought about using Heron's formula but found it complicated. Maybe now that I have coordinates, I can compute vectors and use the cross product method to find the area.\n\nAlternatively, since I have the edge lengths, maybe Heron's formula is manageable now.\n\nSo, triangle ABC has sides AB=\u221a41, BC=\u221a89, AC=\u221a80.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s: (sqrt41 + sqrt80 + sqrt89)/2.\n\nBut this is messy. Alternatively, maybe I can find the area using vectors.\n\nFrom the coordinates, I can compute vectors AB, AC, and then find the area as half the magnitude of their cross product.\n\nWait, point A is (2,5/2,4), B is (-2,-5/2,4), C is (-2,5/2,-4).\n\nCompute vectors AB and AC.\n\nAB = B - A = (-4, -5,0), as before.\n\nAC = C - A = (-4,0,-8), as before.\n\nSo, cross product AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nCompute AB \u00d7 AC:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-4,0,-8)\n\nCross product:\n\n|i     j      k|\n|-4    -5      0|\n|-4     0     -8|\n\nCompute determinant:\n\ni*(-5*(-8) -0*0) - j*(-4*(-8) -0*(-4)) +k*(-4*0 - (-5)*(-4))\n\nSo:\n\ni*(40 -0) - j*(32 -0) +k*(0 -20)\n\n=40i -32j -20k\n\nSo, the cross product is (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)\u00b2 + (-20)^2)\n\nCompute:\n\n40\u00b2=1600, 32\u00b2=1024, 20\u00b2=400.\n\nSum: 1600 +1024=2624 +400=3024.\n\nsqrt(3024). Let's factor 3024.\n\n3024 divided by 16 is 189. So, sqrt(3024)=sqrt(16*189)=4*sqrt(189).\n\nBut 189=9*21=9*3*7. So, sqrt(189)=3*sqrt(21). So, sqrt(3024)=4*3*sqrt(21)=12*sqrt(21).\n\nSo, the magnitude is 12\u221a21. Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is half of this, so 6\u221a21.\n\nSince all four faces are congruent, the total surface area is 4*6\u221a21=24\u221a21.\n\nNow, the inradius formula is Volume = (1/3)*Surface Area*inradius.\n\nSo, 160/3 = (1/3)*24\u221a21 * r, where r is the inradius.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3: 160 =24\u221a21 * r.\n\nSo, r=160/(24\u221a21)= (160/24)/\u221a21.\n\nSimplify 160/24: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 20/3.\n\nSo, r= (20/3)/\u221a21 =20/(3\u221a21).\n\nRationalize the denominator: 20\u221a21/(3*21)=20\u221a21/63.\n\nSo, r=20\u221a21/63.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nWait, but 20 and 63: are they coprime? 20 factors into 2\u00b2*5, 63 is 7*3\u00b2. No common factors, so yes, m and p are coprime.\n\nn=21, which is 3*7, neither of which is squared, so n is square-free.\n\nSo, m+n+p=20+21+63=104.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because I remember that the inradius formula for a tetrahedron is Volume = (1/3)*Surface Area*r, but I might have confused it with the formula for the radius of the circumscribed sphere or something else.\n\nWait, no, actually, for a tetrahedron, the formula is Volume = (1/3)*Surface Area*inradius. So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me check the surface area calculation. Each face has area 6\u221a21, four faces, so 24\u221a21. Volume is 160/3. So, 160/3 = (1/3)*24\u221a21 * r --> 160 =24\u221a21 * r --> r=160/(24\u221a21)=20/(3\u221a21)=20\u221a21/63. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 20+21+63=104.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem about a tetrahedron. Let me try to visualize it first. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces, and in this case, the edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). So, it seems like the opposite edges are equal. That probably means it's a kind of symmetric tetrahedron, maybe called isosceles or something?\n\nThe problem mentions a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. I remember that in a tetrahedron, such a point is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.\n\nTo find the inradius, I think I need to use the formula that relates the volume of the tetrahedron to its inradius and surface area. For a tetrahedron, the formula is Volume = (1/3) * Surface Area * inradius. Wait, actually, no, in a tetrahedron, the formula is Volume = (1/3) * Surface Area * inradius. Hmm, no, wait. Let me recall. For a triangle, the area is (1/2) * perimeter * inradius. For a tetrahedron, the volume is (1/3) times the surface area times the inradius. So, Volume = (1/3) * Surface Area * inradius. So, if I can find the volume and the surface area, I can solve for the inradius.\n\nFirst, I need to compute the volume of the tetrahedron. Since all opposite edges are equal, this tetrahedron is called \"equifacial\" or maybe \"isohedral\"? Wait, no, isohedral means all faces are the same, which might not be the case here. Alternatively, since opposite edges are equal, perhaps it's a special kind of tetrahedron. I think it might be a disphenoid, where opposite edges are equal. Yes, that sounds familiar.\n\nIn a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles, but wait, in this case, the edges are AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD, so each pair of opposite edges is equal, but the faces might not be congruent. Wait, no, actually, in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent. Let me confirm: a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, and all four faces are congruent. So, in this case, since the opposite edges are equal, perhaps the faces are congruent, making it a disphenoid. So, if it's a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent, which would mean the surface area is four times the area of one face.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the edges are given as AB=CD=\u221a41, AC=BD=\u221a80, and BC=AD=\u221a89. So, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt41, sqrt80, sqrt89? Wait, no, each face is a triangle formed by three edges. Wait, no, each face is a triangle with two edges from one vertex. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. Each face is a triangle, so for example, face ABC has edges AB, BC, and AC. Since AB=\u221a41, BC=\u221a89, and AC=\u221a80, so each face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. So, all four faces are congruent triangles, which would make it a disphenoid.\n\nIf all faces are congruent, then each face has the same area. So, maybe I can compute the area of one face and then multiply by four for the total surface area.\n\nSo, let me compute the area of one face first. Let's take triangle ABC with sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nWait, to compute the area of a triangle with sides a, b, c, I can use Heron's formula. Heron's formula says that the area is sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)], where s is the semi-perimeter: s=(a+b+c)/2.\n\nSo, let's compute s for triangle ABC:\n\na = sqrt41, b = sqrt80, c = sqrt89.\n\nFirst, compute a + b + c:\n\nsqrt41 + sqrt80 + sqrt89.\n\nHmm, sqrt41 is approximately 6.403, sqrt80 is approximately 8.944, sqrt89 is approximately 9.434. So, total is approximately 6.403 + 8.944 + 9.434 \u2248 24.781. So, semi-perimeter s \u2248 24.781 / 2 \u2248 12.3905.\n\nBut I need to compute this exactly, not approximately.\n\nWait, let me square the sides to see if it's a right triangle or something. Let's check if a^2 + b^2 = c^2.\n\na^2 = 41, b^2=80, c^2=89.\n\n41 + 80 = 121, which is not equal to 89, so it's not a right triangle. Hmm.\n\nSo, I need to compute Heron's formula.\n\nCompute s = (sqrt41 + sqrt80 + sqrt89)/2.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe instead of directly computing Heron's formula, I can find the area another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the volume of the tetrahedron first, and then find the inradius.\n\nWait, how else can I compute the volume? Maybe using the Cayley-Menger determinant. I remember that for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, the volume can be computed via the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nVolume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   AB\u00b2 AC\u00b2 AD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AB\u00b2  0   BC\u00b2 BD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AC\u00b2 BC\u00b2  0   CD\u00b2 |\n| 1  AD\u00b2 BD\u00b2 CD\u00b2  0  |\n\nSo, the determinant is a 5x5 matrix, but it's symmetric, so maybe I can compute it step by step.\n\nGiven the edge lengths:\n\nAB = sqrt41 => AB\u00b2 = 41,\n\nAC = sqrt80 => AC\u00b2 = 80,\n\nAD = sqrt89 => AD\u00b2 = 89,\n\nBC = sqrt89 => BC\u00b2 =89,\n\nBD = sqrt80 => BD\u00b2=80,\n\nCD = sqrt41 => CD\u00b2=41.\n\nSo, the CM determinant matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nSo, the determinant is:\n\n| 0  1    1     1     1  |\n| 1  0   41    80    89 |\n| 1 41    0    89    80 |\n| 1 80   89     0    41 |\n| 1 89   80    41     0 |\n\nThis determinant is a bit complicated, but perhaps there's some symmetry here that can help me compute it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the volume of a disphenoid. I think for a disphenoid, the volume can be computed as (sqrt[(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)]) / (6*sqrt(2)), but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, no, maybe that's for a different kind of tetrahedron. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's simpler to use coordinates. Since the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, perhaps I can assign coordinates to the vertices such that the tetrahedron is symmetric.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the tetrahedron. Let's place the points in 3D space such that the midpoints of opposite edges are at the origin or something like that.\n\nWait, let me think. Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron is symmetric with respect to the origin. So, perhaps I can set points A, B, C, D such that A = (x, y, z), B = (-x, -y, z), C = (-x, y, -z), D = (x, -y, -z). Or something like that. Let me check if this setup would give opposite edges equal.\n\nWait, if I set points as A = (a, b, c), B = (-a, -b, c), C = (-a, b, -c), D = (a, -b, -c), then let's compute the distances.\n\nCompute AB: distance between A and B.\n\nA is (a,b,c), B is (-a,-b,c). So,\n\nAB\u00b2 = (a - (-a))\u00b2 + (b - (-b))\u00b2 + (c - c)\u00b2 = (2a)^2 + (2b)^2 + 0 = 4a\u00b2 +4b\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, CD: distance between C and D.\n\nC is (-a,b,-c), D is (a,-b,-c).\n\nCD\u00b2 = ( -a -a )\u00b2 + (b - (-b))\u00b2 + (-c - (-c))\u00b2 = (-2a)^2 + (2b)^2 + 0 = 4a\u00b2 +4b\u00b2.\n\nSo, AB\u00b2 = CD\u00b2 = 4a\u00b2 +4b\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, AC\u00b2: distance between A and C.\n\nA = (a,b,c), C = (-a,b,-c).\n\nAC\u00b2 = (a - (-a))\u00b2 + (b - b)^2 + (c - (-c))\u00b2 = (2a)^2 + 0 + (2c)^2 =4a\u00b2 +4c\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, BD\u00b2: distance between B and D.\n\nB = (-a,-b,c), D = (a,-b,-c).\n\nBD\u00b2 = (-a -a)^2 + (-b - (-b))^2 + (c - (-c))^2 = (-2a)^2 +0 + (2c)^2 =4a\u00b2 +4c\u00b2.\n\nSo, AC\u00b2 = BD\u00b2 =4a\u00b2 +4c\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, BC\u00b2: distance between B and C.\n\nB = (-a,-b,c), C = (-a,b,-c).\n\nBC\u00b2 = (-a - (-a))\u00b2 + (-b - b)^2 + (c - (-c))\u00b2 = 0 + (-2b)^2 + (2c)^2 =4b\u00b2 +4c\u00b2.\n\nAD\u00b2: distance between A and D.\n\nA = (a,b,c), D = (a,-b,-c).\n\nAD\u00b2 = (a -a)^2 + (b - (-b))\u00b2 + (c - (-c))\u00b2 =0 + (2b)^2 + (2c)^2=4b\u00b2 +4c\u00b2.\n\nSo, BC\u00b2 = AD\u00b2 =4b\u00b2 +4c\u00b2.\n\nSo, in this coordinate system, we have AB\u00b2=CD\u00b2=4a\u00b2+4b\u00b2, AC\u00b2=BD\u00b2=4a\u00b2+4c\u00b2, BC\u00b2=AD\u00b2=4b\u00b2+4c\u00b2.\n\nIn our problem, AB\u00b2=41, AC\u00b2=80, BC\u00b2=89.\n\nSo, set up the equations:\n\n4a\u00b2 +4b\u00b2 =41 --> (1)\n\n4a\u00b2 +4c\u00b2=80 --> (2)\n\n4b\u00b2 +4c\u00b2=89 --> (3)\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\n1) a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4\n\n2) a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 80/4 =20\n\n3) b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =89/4\n\nSo, let's write them:\n\nEquation (1): a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4\n\nEquation (2): a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20\n\nEquation (3): b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nSo, we can solve for a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2.\n\nLet me subtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4\n\nc\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (80/4 -41/4) =39/4\n\nSo, c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 =39/4 --> equation (4)\n\nBut from equation (3): b\u00b2 + c\u00b2=89/4.\n\nWe have equation (3): b\u00b2 + c\u00b2=89/4 and equation (4): c\u00b2 - b\u00b2=39/4.\n\nLet me add equations (3) and (4):\n\n( b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 ) + ( c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 ) = 89/4 +39/4\n\n2c\u00b2=128/4=32 --> c\u00b2=16.\n\nSo, c\u00b2=16 --> c=4 or c=-4, but since it's squared, we can take c=4.\n\nThen from equation (4): c\u00b2 - b\u00b2=39/4 -->16 - b\u00b2=39/4 --> b\u00b2=16 -39/4= (64/4 -39/4)=25/4.\n\nSo, b\u00b2=25/4 --> b=5/2 or -5/2.\n\nFrom equation (1): a\u00b2 + b\u00b2=41/4 --> a\u00b2 +25/4=41/4 --> a\u00b2=16/4=4 --> a=2 or -2.\n\nSo, a=2, b=5/2, c=4.\n\nSo, the coordinates are:\n\nA = (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB = (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC = (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nD = (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nWait, let me confirm that. So, according to my earlier assignment:\n\nA = (a, b, c) = (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB = (-a, -b, c) = (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC = (-a, b, -c) = (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nD = (a, -b, -c) = (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nYes, that looks correct.\n\nNow, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron. The volume can be found using the scalar triple product of vectors.\n\nLet's choose one vertex as the origin, say point A. Then vectors AB, AC, AD can be used to compute the volume.\n\nBut wait, in our coordinate system, point A is at (2,5/2,4), so it's not at the origin. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the volume using the determinant formula with coordinates.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with vertices at points A, B, C, D is |det(B - A, C - A, D - A)| / 6.\n\nSo, let's compute vectors B - A, C - A, D - A.\n\nCompute B - A: coordinates of B minus coordinates of A.\n\nB is (-2, -5/2,4), A is (2,5/2,4).\n\nSo, B - A = (-2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, 4 -4) = (-4, -5, 0).\n\nSimilarly, C - A: C is (-2,5/2,-4), A is (2,5/2,4).\n\nSo, C - A = (-2 -2,5/2 -5/2, -4 -4)= (-4, 0, -8).\n\nD - A: D is (2,-5/2,-4), A is (2,5/2,4).\n\nSo, D - A = (2-2, -5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8).\n\nSo, vectors:\n\nu = B - A = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nv = C - A = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nw = D - A = (0, -5, -8)\n\nNow, the scalar triple product is u \u22c5 (v \u00d7 w).\n\nFirst, compute v \u00d7 w.\n\nv \u00d7 w = |i   j    k|\n         |-4   0   -8|\n         |0   -5   -8|\n\nSo, determinant:\n\ni*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) -0*0)\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni: 0*(-8) =0, (-8)*(-5)=40 --> 0 -40 = -40. So, i*(-40)\n\nj: (-4)*(-8)=32, (-8)*0=0 --> 32 -0=32. So, j*(-32) [since it's subtracted]\n\nk: (-4)*(-5)=20, 0*0=0 -->20 -0=20. So, k*(20)\n\nThus, v \u00d7 w = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the cross product formula is:\n\nIf vector v = (v1, v2, v3), w = (w1, w2, w3), then\n\nv \u00d7 w = (v2w3 - v3w2, v3w1 - v1w3, v1w2 - v2w1)\n\nSo, v = (-4,0,-8), w = (0,-5,-8).\n\nCompute:\n\nFirst component: (0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) =0 -40= -40\n\nSecond component: (-8)*0 - (-4)*(-8) =0 -32= -32\n\nThird component: (-4)*(-5) -0*0=20 -0=20\n\nSo, v \u00d7 w = (-40, -32,20)\n\nSo, u \u22c5 (v \u00d7 w) is the dot product of u and this vector.\n\nu is (-4, -5, 0).\n\nDot product:\n\n(-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) +0*20 = 160 +160 +0=320.\n\nSo, scalar triple product is 320. Then the volume is |320| /6 = 320/6 = 160/3.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, Volume = 160/3.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm: the scalar triple product is 320, so the volume is |320| /6 = 320/6=160/3. So, yes.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the Cayley-Menger determinant, but this coordinate method worked out.\n\nNow, moving on to compute the surface area. Since all four faces are congruent triangles, as in a disphenoid, each face has the same area, so the total surface area is four times the area of one face.\n\nSo, let's compute the area of one face, say triangle ABC.\n\nWait, earlier I thought about using Heron's formula but found it complicated. Maybe now that I have coordinates, I can compute vectors and use the cross product method to find the area.\n\nAlternatively, since I have the edge lengths, maybe Heron's formula is manageable now.\n\nSo, triangle ABC has sides AB=\u221a41, BC=\u221a89, AC=\u221a80.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s: (sqrt41 + sqrt80 + sqrt89)/2.\n\nBut this is messy. Alternatively, maybe I can find the area using vectors.\n\nFrom the coordinates, I can compute vectors AB, AC, and then find the area as half the magnitude of their cross product.\n\nWait, point A is (2,5/2,4), B is (-2,-5/2,4), C is (-2,5/2,-4).\n\nCompute vectors AB and AC.\n\nAB = B - A = (-4, -5,0), as before.\n\nAC = C - A = (-4,0,-8), as before.\n\nSo, cross product AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nCompute AB \u00d7 AC:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-4,0,-8)\n\nCross product:\n\n|i     j      k|\n|-4    -5      0|\n|-4     0     -8|\n\nCompute determinant:\n\ni*(-5*(-8) -0*0) - j*(-4*(-8) -0*(-4)) +k*(-4*0 - (-5)*(-4))\n\nSo:\n\ni*(40 -0) - j*(32 -0) +k*(0 -20)\n\n=40i -32j -20k\n\nSo, the cross product is (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)\u00b2 + (-20)^2)\n\nCompute:\n\n40\u00b2=1600, 32\u00b2=1024, 20\u00b2=400.\n\nSum: 1600 +1024=2624 +400=3024.\n\nsqrt(3024). Let's factor 3024.\n\n3024 divided by 16 is 189. So, sqrt(3024)=sqrt(16*189)=4*sqrt(189).\n\nBut 189=9*21=9*3*7. So, sqrt(189)=3*sqrt(21). So, sqrt(3024)=4*3*sqrt(21)=12*sqrt(21).\n\nSo, the magnitude is 12\u221a21. Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is half of this, so 6\u221a21.\n\nSince all four faces are congruent, the total surface area is 4*6\u221a21=24\u221a21.\n\nNow, the inradius formula is Volume = (1/3)*Surface Area*inradius.\n\nSo, 160/3 = (1/3)*24\u221a21 * r, where r is the inradius.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3: 160 =24\u221a21 * r.\n\nSo, r=160/(24\u221a21)= (160/24)/\u221a21.\n\nSimplify 160/24: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 20/3.\n\nSo, r= (20/3)/\u221a21 =20/(3\u221a21).\n\nRationalize the denominator: 20\u221a21/(3*21)=20\u221a21/63.\n\nSo, r=20\u221a21/63.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nWait, but 20 and 63: are they coprime? 20 factors into 2\u00b2*5, 63 is 7*3\u00b2. No common factors, so yes, m and p are coprime.\n\nn=21, which is 3*7, neither of which is squared, so n is square-free.\n\nSo, m+n+p=20+21+63=104.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because I remember that the inradius formula for a tetrahedron is Volume = (1/3)*Surface Area*r, but I might have confused it with the formula for the radius of the circumscribed sphere or something else.\n\nWait, no, actually, for a tetrahedron, the formula is Volume = (1/3)*Surface Area*inradius. So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me check the surface area calculation. Each face has area 6\u221a21, four faces, so 24\u221a21. Volume is 160/3. So, 160/3 = (1/3)*24\u221a21 * r --> 160 =24\u221a21 * r --> r=160/(24\u221a21)=20/(3\u221a21)=20\u221a21/63. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 20+21+63=104.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we recognize that the given tetrahedron is a disphenoid with opposite edges equal. We assign coordinates to the vertices based on the symmetry of the tetrahedron and use these coordinates to compute the volume and surface area.\n\n1. **Coordinates Assignment**:  \n   We assign coordinates to the vertices as follows:\n   - \\( A = (2, \\frac{5}{2}, 4) \\)\n   - \\( B = (-2, -\\frac{5}{2}, 4) \\)\n   - \\( C = (-2, \\frac{5}{2}, -4) \\)\n   - \\( D = (2, -\\frac{5}{2}, -4) \\)\n\n2. **Volume Calculation**:  \n   Using the scalar triple product of vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{AB} \\), \\( \\overrightarrow{AC} \\), and \\( \\overrightarrow{AD} \\), we find the volume of the tetrahedron:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume} = \\frac{1}{6} \\left| \\overrightarrow{AB} \\cdot (\\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD}) \\right| = \\frac{160}{3}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Surface Area Calculation**:  \n   Each face of the tetrahedron is a congruent triangle with sides \\( \\sqrt{41} \\), \\( \\sqrt{80} \\), and \\( \\sqrt{89} \\). Using the cross product method, we find the area of one face:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of one face} = 6\\sqrt{21}\n   \\]\n   The total surface area is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Surface Area} = 4 \\times 6\\sqrt{21} = 24\\sqrt{21}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Inradius Calculation**:  \n   Using the formula \\( \\text{Volume} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Surface Area} \\times \\text{inradius} \\), we solve for the inradius \\( r \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{160}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 24\\sqrt{21} \\times r \\implies r = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer**:  \n   The inradius is expressed as \\( \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63} \\). Therefore, \\( m = 20 \\), \\( n = 21 \\), and \\( p = 63 \\). Summing these values gives:\n   \\[\n   m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\n   \\]\n\n\\boxed{104}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a point inside it to each of its faces. The point is called I, and the distance is the same for all four faces. Hmm, I think this point is called the incenter of the tetrahedron, similar to the incenter in a triangle, which is the center of the inscribed sphere.\n\nFirst, let me note down all the given edge lengths:\n\n- AB = CD = sqrt(41)\n- AC = BD = sqrt(80)\n- BC = AD = sqrt(89)\n\nSo, each pair of opposite edges are equal. That seems symmetrical, which might help in calculations.\n\nI remember that for a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:\n\nr = 3V / S\n\nWhere V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces). So, I need to find V and S.\n\nBut before that, maybe I should find the coordinates of the tetrahedron to compute the volume and areas. Since it's symmetrical, perhaps I can place the points in a coordinate system to make calculations easier.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the vertices. Let's assume point A is at (a, b, c), B at (d, e, f), and so on. But that might get too complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, another approach: since opposite edges are equal, the tetrahedron might be isohedral or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a disphenoid, which is a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. Yes, that's right. So, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron with four congruent triangular faces, but in this case, the edges are not all the same, so maybe it's a general disphenoid.\n\nIn a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt((a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)))/72\n\nWait, no, that formula is for a different kind of tetrahedron. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a disphenoid, perhaps it's possible to place the points in such a way that the centroid is at the origin, and coordinates are symmetric.\n\nWait, let's try this: Let me place the points such that A, B, C, D are symmetric with respect to the origin. Maybe something like A = (x, y, z), B = (-x, -y, z), C = (-x, y, -z), D = (x, -y, -z). That way, opposite edges are equal because of the symmetry.\n\nLet me see if that works. Then, AB would be the distance between (x,y,z) and (-x,-y,z). So, AB^2 = (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 = 4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2. Similarly, CD is the distance between (-x,y,-z) and (x,-y,-z), which is also 4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2, so that's consistent with AB=CD.\n\nSimilarly, AC is the distance between (x,y,z) and (-x,y,-z). So, AC^2 = (2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2 = 4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2. Similarly, BD is the distance between (-x,-y,z) and (x,-y,-z), which is also 4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2, matching AC=BD.\n\nSimilarly, BC is the distance between (-x,y,-z) and (-x,-y,z), which is 0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 = 4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2. And AD is the distance between (x,y,z) and (x,-y,-z), which is 0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 = same as BC. So, yes, this placement satisfies the given edge lengths.\n\nSo, the edge lengths squared are:\n\nAB\u00b2 = 4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2 = 41\n\nAC\u00b2 = 4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2 = 80\n\nBC\u00b2 = 4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2 = 89\n\nSo, I have three equations:\n\n1. 4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2 = 41 \u2192 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n2. 4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2 = 80 \u2192 x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\n3. 4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2 = 89 \u2192 y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nLet me write these as:\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n\nEquation 2: x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\n\nEquation 3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nI can solve these equations for x\u00b2, y\u00b2, z\u00b2.\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4\n\nz\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = (80/4 - 41/4) = 39/4\n\nBut from equation 3, we have y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo, now I have:\n\nz\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 39/4\n\nz\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nLet me add these two equations:\n\n2z\u00b2 = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32 \u2192 z\u00b2 = 16 \u2192 z = 4 or -4, but since it's a coordinate, I can take z=4.\n\nThen, subtract the two equations:\n\n(z\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - (z\u00b2 - y\u00b2) = (89/4 - 39/4) \u2192 2y\u00b2 = 50/4 = 25/2 \u2192 y\u00b2 = 25/4 \u2192 y = 5/2 or -5/2.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 1:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 41/4 - 25/4 = 16/4 = 4 \u2192 x = 2 or -2.\n\nSo, x=2, y=5/2, z=4. So, the coordinates are:\n\nA = (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB = (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC = (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nD = (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nWait, let me confirm the distances:\n\nAB: distance between (2,5/2,4) and (-2,-5/2,4):\n\ndx=4, dy=5, dz=0 \u2192 AB^2=16 + 25=41, correct.\n\nAC: distance between (2,5/2,4) and (-2,5/2,-4):\n\ndx=4, dy=0, dz=8 \u2192 AC^2=16 + 64=80, correct.\n\nBC: distance between (-2,5/2,-4) and (-2,-5/2,4):\n\ndx=0, dy=5, dz=8 \u2192 BC^2=25 + 64=89, correct.\n\nGood, so the coordinates are correct.\n\nNow, I need to compute the volume of the tetrahedron. Since I have coordinates for all four points, I can use the scalar triple product formula.\n\nThe formula for the volume is | (AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD)) | / 6.\n\nBut let me assign vectors. Let me take point A as the origin for vectors, so vectors AB, AC, AD are from A to B, A to C, A to D.\n\nWait, no, since the coordinates are already set, perhaps it's better to compute vectors AB, AC, AD based on the points.\n\nWait, actually, the volume can be calculated using the determinant of a matrix formed by vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nAlternatively, using coordinates, the volume is |det([B - A, C - A, D - A])| / 6.\n\nLet me compute vectors:\n\nB - A = (-2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, 4 -4) = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nC - A = (-2 - 2, 5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nD - A = (2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8)\n\nSo, the vectors are:\n\nu = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nv = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nw = (0, -5, -8)\n\nThe volume is |det([u v w])| / 6.\n\nLet me compute the determinant.\n\nThe matrix is:\n\n| -4   -4    0 |\n\n| -5    0   -5 |\n\n| 0    -8   -8 |\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no, the vectors are u, v, w as columns, so:\n\nMatrix M:\n\n[ -4   -4    0 ]\n\n[ -5    0   -5 ]\n\n[  0   -8   -8 ]\n\nCompute the determinant:\n\ndet(M) = -4*(0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) - (-4)*( -5*(-8) - (-5)*0 ) + 0*(... )\n\nWait, let me compute it step by step.\n\nUsing the first row for expansion:\n\ndet(M) = -4 * det( [ [0, -5], [-8, -8] ] ) - (-4) * det( [ [-5, -5], [0, -8] ] ) + 0 * det(...)\n\nSo, first term: -4 * (0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) = -4*(0 - 40) = -4*(-40) = 160\n\nSecond term: - (-4) * [ (-5)*(-8) - (-5)*0 ] = 4*(40 - 0) = 160\n\nThird term: 0, so nothing.\n\nSo, det(M) = 160 + 160 = 320\n\nTherefore, the volume V = |320| / 6 = 320/6 = 160/3\n\nWait, but let me double-check the determinant calculation because it's easy to make a mistake here.\n\nWait, the matrix is:\n\nRow 1: -4, -4, 0\n\nRow 2: -5, 0, -5\n\nRow 3: 0, -8, -8\n\nSo, the determinant is:\n\n-4*(0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) - (-4)*( (-5)*(-8) - (-5)*0 ) + 0*(... )\n\nSo, first term: -4*(0 - 40) = -4*(-40) = 160\n\nSecond term: -(-4)*(40 - 0) = 4*40 = 160\n\nThird term: 0\n\nTotal: 160 + 160 = 320. So yes, determinant is 320.\n\nSo, volume V = 320 / 6 = 160/3.\n\nWait, 320 divided by 6 is 160/3. Correct.\n\nSo, V = 160/3.\n\nNext, I need to compute the total surface area S. Since all four faces are congruent? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles, but in this case, the edges are different, so maybe the faces are not congruent, but each pair of opposite faces are congruent.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid, the opposite edges are equal, which makes the opposite faces congruent. So, in this case, since AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD, so each pair of opposite faces are congruent.\n\nSo, the four faces are two pairs of congruent triangles.\n\nTherefore, I can compute the area of one face from each pair and multiply by two.\n\nSo, let's compute the areas of the faces.\n\nFirst, let's compute the area of triangle ABC.\n\nPoints A(2,5/2,4), B(-2,-5/2,4), C(-2,5/2,-4).\n\nWait, actually, I think it's better to compute the area using Heron's formula. Alternatively, since I have the lengths of the edges, I can compute the area.\n\nWait, for triangle ABC, the edges are AB, BC, and AC.\n\nWe know AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), and AC = sqrt(80).\n\nSo, sides are a= sqrt(41), b= sqrt(80), c= sqrt(89).\n\nWait, no: Wait, in triangle ABC, the sides are AB, BC, and AC.\n\nWait, AB is between A and B: sqrt(41)\n\nBC is between B and C: sqrt(89)\n\nAC is between A and C: sqrt(80)\n\nSo, sides are sqrt(41), sqrt(89), sqrt(80).\n\nWait, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps using vectors to compute the area.\n\nAlternatively, since I have coordinates, maybe compute the area using the cross product.\n\nThe area of triangle ABC is (1/2) | AB \u00d7 AC |.\n\nCompute vectors AB and AC.\n\nVector AB: B - A = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nVector AC: C - A = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCompute cross product AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nAB \u00d7 AC = |i    j     k|\n           |-4   -5     0|\n           |-4    0    -8|\n\n= i [ (-5)(-8) - 0*0 ] - j [ (-4)(-8) - 0*(-4) ] + k [ (-4)(0) - (-5)(-4) ]\n\n= i [40 - 0] - j [32 - 0] + k [0 - 20]\n\n= 40i -32j -20k\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7 = 4\u00b2 * 3\u00b2 * 3 *7\n\nSo sqrt(3024) = 4 *3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21)\n\nTherefore, the area is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, the area of triangle ABC is 6 sqrt(21). Since the opposite face is congruent, the area of triangle ADC is also 6 sqrt(21). Wait, no, wait: in a disphenoid, the opposite faces are congruent. So, if ABC is one face, the opposite face is ADC? Or is it BCD?\n\nWait, no, in a tetrahedron, each face has an opposite face. So, ABC is opposite to D, and BCD is opposite to A.\n\nWait, maybe I should confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pair of opposite faces are congruent. So, the two faces ABC and ADC are congruent, and the other two faces ABD and BCD are congruent.\n\nWait, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe all four faces are congruent, but in this case, given the edge lengths, I don't think so.\n\nWait, in our case, the edges are:\n\nAB=CD= sqrt(41)\n\nAC=BD= sqrt(80)\n\nBC=AD= sqrt(89)\n\nSo, in the face ABC, the edges are AB, BC, AC.\n\nIn face ABD, the edges are AB, BD, AD.\n\nSo, in face ABC: sides sqrt(41), sqrt(89), sqrt(80)\n\nIn face ABD: sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89)\n\nSo, the two faces ABC and ABD have the same side lengths, just in different order. Therefore, they are congruent.\n\nSimilarly, faces BCD and ACD would also be congruent.\n\nSo, there are two pairs of congruent triangular faces.\n\nSo, the surface area S is 2*(area of ABC) + 2*(area of ABD). Wait, but since ABC and ABD are congruent, actually, S = 4*(area of ABC). But wait, no, because each face is only counted once.\n\nWait, no, in reality, the four faces are ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD.\n\nGiven the edge lengths, each face has two sides from the \"same\" pair and one from another.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the area of two different triangles and then double each.\n\nWait, but since I already computed the area of ABC as 6 sqrt(21), let me compute the area of another face, say ABD.\n\nFace ABD: points A, B, D.\n\nVectors AB and AD.\n\nWait, vectors AB = (-4, -5, 0), AD = D - A = (0, -5, -8).\n\nCompute cross product AB \u00d7 AD.\n\nAB \u00d7 AD = |i    j     k|\n           |-4   -5     0|\n           | 0   -5    -8|\n\n= i [ (-5)(-8) - 0*(-5) ] - j [ (-4)(-8) - 0*0 ] + k [ (-4)(-5) - (-5)*0 ]\n\n= i [40 - 0] - j [32 - 0] + k [20 - 0]\n\n= 40i -32j +20k\n\nThe magnitude is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + 20\u00b2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024) again.\n\nSo, same as before, sqrt(3024) = 12 sqrt(21). Therefore, area is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, both ABC and ABD have the same area. Therefore, all four faces have the same area? Wait, that can't be right because in a disphenoid, the opposite faces are congruent, but not necessarily all four.\n\nWait, but according to the calculations, both ABC and ABD have the same area. Hmm, perhaps in this case, all four faces are congruent. Let me check the lengths of the edges of face ACD.\n\nFace ACD: points A, C, D.\n\nEdges AC = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41), AD = sqrt(89)\n\nSo, sides sqrt(80), sqrt(41), sqrt(89), same as ABC. So, yes, all four faces have the same side lengths, hence are congruent. Therefore, all four faces have the same area, 6 sqrt(21).\n\nWait, so total surface area S = 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21).\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, if all four faces are congruent, then each has the same area, so yes, S = 4 * (area of one face). So, if area of ABC is 6 sqrt(21), then S = 24 sqrt(21).\n\nBut wait, when I computed the cross product for ABC, I got 6 sqrt(21). Let me confirm the cross product.\n\nFor ABC:\n\nAB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024). 3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 144 * 21. So sqrt(3024)=12 sqrt(21). So, half of that is 6 sqrt(21). So yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, each face has area 6 sqrt(21), so total surface area S = 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21).\n\nNow, the inradius formula is r = 3V / S.\n\nSo, plugging in V = 160/3 and S = 24 sqrt(21):\n\nr = 3*(160/3) / (24 sqrt(21)) ) = (160) / (24 sqrt(21)) = (160)/(24 sqrt(21)).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8: 20 / (3 sqrt(21)).\n\nRationalize the denominator: 20 sqrt(21) / (3 * 21) = (20 sqrt(21))/63.\n\nSo, r = (20 sqrt(21))/63.\n\nThe problem states that the distance can be written as m sqrt(n)/p, where m and p are coprime, and n is square-free.\n\nHere, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nWait, but 20 and 63 are coprime? Let's see: factors of 20 are 2,4,5,10,20; factors of 63 are 3,7,9,21,63. No common factors except 1. So yes, m and p are coprime.\n\nAnd 21 is 3*7, which is square-free. So yes, that's the form.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63. Then, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the inradius formula. I thought it was r = 3V/S, but let me confirm.\n\nYes, for a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius is indeed r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers, 3*(160/3) = 160, then 160 divided by (24 sqrt(21)) is 160/(24 sqrt(21)).\n\nSimplify 160/24: divide numerator and denominator by 8, get 20/3.\n\nSo, 20/(3 sqrt(21)) = (20 sqrt(21))/(3*21) = (20 sqrt(21))/63.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, r = 20 sqrt(21)/63.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nTherefore, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but 63 can be simplified? 63 is 7*9, which is 7*3\u00b2. Wait, but in the fraction, it's 20/63. 20 and 63 are coprime, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, the answer is 104.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a point inside it to each of its faces. The point is called I, and the distance is the same for all four faces. Hmm, I think this point is called the incenter of the tetrahedron, similar to the incenter in a triangle, which is the center of the inscribed sphere.\n\nFirst, let me note down all the given edge lengths:\n\n- AB = CD = sqrt(41)\n- AC = BD = sqrt(80)\n- BC = AD = sqrt(89)\n\nSo, each pair of opposite edges are equal. That seems symmetrical, which might help in calculations.\n\nI remember that for a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:\n\nr = 3V / S\n\nWhere V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces). So, I need to find V and S.\n\nBut before that, maybe I should find the coordinates of the tetrahedron to compute the volume and areas. Since it's symmetrical, perhaps I can place the points in a coordinate system to make calculations easier.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the vertices. Let's assume point A is at (a, b, c), B at (d, e, f), and so on. But that might get too complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, another approach: since opposite edges are equal, the tetrahedron might be isohedral or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a disphenoid, which is a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. Yes, that's right. So, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron with four congruent triangular faces, but in this case, the edges are not all the same, so maybe it's a general disphenoid.\n\nIn a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt((a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)))/72\n\nWait, no, that formula is for a different kind of tetrahedron. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a disphenoid, perhaps it's possible to place the points in such a way that the centroid is at the origin, and coordinates are symmetric.\n\nWait, let's try this: Let me place the points such that A, B, C, D are symmetric with respect to the origin. Maybe something like A = (x, y, z), B = (-x, -y, z), C = (-x, y, -z), D = (x, -y, -z). That way, opposite edges are equal because of the symmetry.\n\nLet me see if that works. Then, AB would be the distance between (x,y,z) and (-x,-y,z). So, AB^2 = (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 = 4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2. Similarly, CD is the distance between (-x,y,-z) and (x,-y,-z), which is also 4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2, so that's consistent with AB=CD.\n\nSimilarly, AC is the distance between (x,y,z) and (-x,y,-z). So, AC^2 = (2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2 = 4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2. Similarly, BD is the distance between (-x,-y,z) and (x,-y,-z), which is also 4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2, matching AC=BD.\n\nSimilarly, BC is the distance between (-x,y,-z) and (-x,-y,z), which is 0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 = 4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2. And AD is the distance between (x,y,z) and (x,-y,-z), which is 0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 = same as BC. So, yes, this placement satisfies the given edge lengths.\n\nSo, the edge lengths squared are:\n\nAB\u00b2 = 4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2 = 41\n\nAC\u00b2 = 4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2 = 80\n\nBC\u00b2 = 4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2 = 89\n\nSo, I have three equations:\n\n1. 4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2 = 41 \u2192 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n2. 4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2 = 80 \u2192 x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\n3. 4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2 = 89 \u2192 y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nLet me write these as:\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n\nEquation 2: x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\n\nEquation 3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nI can solve these equations for x\u00b2, y\u00b2, z\u00b2.\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4\n\nz\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = (80/4 - 41/4) = 39/4\n\nBut from equation 3, we have y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo, now I have:\n\nz\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 39/4\n\nz\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nLet me add these two equations:\n\n2z\u00b2 = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32 \u2192 z\u00b2 = 16 \u2192 z = 4 or -4, but since it's a coordinate, I can take z=4.\n\nThen, subtract the two equations:\n\n(z\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - (z\u00b2 - y\u00b2) = (89/4 - 39/4) \u2192 2y\u00b2 = 50/4 = 25/2 \u2192 y\u00b2 = 25/4 \u2192 y = 5/2 or -5/2.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 1:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 41/4 - 25/4 = 16/4 = 4 \u2192 x = 2 or -2.\n\nSo, x=2, y=5/2, z=4. So, the coordinates are:\n\nA = (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB = (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC = (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nD = (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nWait, let me confirm the distances:\n\nAB: distance between (2,5/2,4) and (-2,-5/2,4):\n\ndx=4, dy=5, dz=0 \u2192 AB^2=16 + 25=41, correct.\n\nAC: distance between (2,5/2,4) and (-2,5/2,-4):\n\ndx=4, dy=0, dz=8 \u2192 AC^2=16 + 64=80, correct.\n\nBC: distance between (-2,5/2,-4) and (-2,-5/2,4):\n\ndx=0, dy=5, dz=8 \u2192 BC^2=25 + 64=89, correct.\n\nGood, so the coordinates are correct.\n\nNow, I need to compute the volume of the tetrahedron. Since I have coordinates for all four points, I can use the scalar triple product formula.\n\nThe formula for the volume is | (AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD)) | / 6.\n\nBut let me assign vectors. Let me take point A as the origin for vectors, so vectors AB, AC, AD are from A to B, A to C, A to D.\n\nWait, no, since the coordinates are already set, perhaps it's better to compute vectors AB, AC, AD based on the points.\n\nWait, actually, the volume can be calculated using the determinant of a matrix formed by vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nAlternatively, using coordinates, the volume is |det([B - A, C - A, D - A])| / 6.\n\nLet me compute vectors:\n\nB - A = (-2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, 4 -4) = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nC - A = (-2 - 2, 5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nD - A = (2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8)\n\nSo, the vectors are:\n\nu = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nv = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nw = (0, -5, -8)\n\nThe volume is |det([u v w])| / 6.\n\nLet me compute the determinant.\n\nThe matrix is:\n\n| -4   -4    0 |\n\n| -5    0   -5 |\n\n| 0    -8   -8 |\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no, the vectors are u, v, w as columns, so:\n\nMatrix M:\n\n[ -4   -4    0 ]\n\n[ -5    0   -5 ]\n\n[  0   -8   -8 ]\n\nCompute the determinant:\n\ndet(M) = -4*(0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) - (-4)*( -5*(-8) - (-5)*0 ) + 0*(... )\n\nWait, let me compute it step by step.\n\nUsing the first row for expansion:\n\ndet(M) = -4 * det( [ [0, -5], [-8, -8] ] ) - (-4) * det( [ [-5, -5], [0, -8] ] ) + 0 * det(...)\n\nSo, first term: -4 * (0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) = -4*(0 - 40) = -4*(-40) = 160\n\nSecond term: - (-4) * [ (-5)*(-8) - (-5)*0 ] = 4*(40 - 0) = 160\n\nThird term: 0, so nothing.\n\nSo, det(M) = 160 + 160 = 320\n\nTherefore, the volume V = |320| / 6 = 320/6 = 160/3\n\nWait, but let me double-check the determinant calculation because it's easy to make a mistake here.\n\nWait, the matrix is:\n\nRow 1: -4, -4, 0\n\nRow 2: -5, 0, -5\n\nRow 3: 0, -8, -8\n\nSo, the determinant is:\n\n-4*(0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) - (-4)*( (-5)*(-8) - (-5)*0 ) + 0*(... )\n\nSo, first term: -4*(0 - 40) = -4*(-40) = 160\n\nSecond term: -(-4)*(40 - 0) = 4*40 = 160\n\nThird term: 0\n\nTotal: 160 + 160 = 320. So yes, determinant is 320.\n\nSo, volume V = 320 / 6 = 160/3.\n\nWait, 320 divided by 6 is 160/3. Correct.\n\nSo, V = 160/3.\n\nNext, I need to compute the total surface area S. Since all four faces are congruent? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles, but in this case, the edges are different, so maybe the faces are not congruent, but each pair of opposite faces are congruent.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid, the opposite edges are equal, which makes the opposite faces congruent. So, in this case, since AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD, so each pair of opposite faces are congruent.\n\nSo, the four faces are two pairs of congruent triangles.\n\nTherefore, I can compute the area of one face from each pair and multiply by two.\n\nSo, let's compute the areas of the faces.\n\nFirst, let's compute the area of triangle ABC.\n\nPoints A(2,5/2,4), B(-2,-5/2,4), C(-2,5/2,-4).\n\nWait, actually, I think it's better to compute the area using Heron's formula. Alternatively, since I have the lengths of the edges, I can compute the area.\n\nWait, for triangle ABC, the edges are AB, BC, and AC.\n\nWe know AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), and AC = sqrt(80).\n\nSo, sides are a= sqrt(41), b= sqrt(80), c= sqrt(89).\n\nWait, no: Wait, in triangle ABC, the sides are AB, BC, and AC.\n\nWait, AB is between A and B: sqrt(41)\n\nBC is between B and C: sqrt(89)\n\nAC is between A and C: sqrt(80)\n\nSo, sides are sqrt(41), sqrt(89), sqrt(80).\n\nWait, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps using vectors to compute the area.\n\nAlternatively, since I have coordinates, maybe compute the area using the cross product.\n\nThe area of triangle ABC is (1/2) | AB \u00d7 AC |.\n\nCompute vectors AB and AC.\n\nVector AB: B - A = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nVector AC: C - A = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCompute cross product AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nAB \u00d7 AC = |i    j     k|\n           |-4   -5     0|\n           |-4    0    -8|\n\n= i [ (-5)(-8) - 0*0 ] - j [ (-4)(-8) - 0*(-4) ] + k [ (-4)(0) - (-5)(-4) ]\n\n= i [40 - 0] - j [32 - 0] + k [0 - 20]\n\n= 40i -32j -20k\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7 = 4\u00b2 * 3\u00b2 * 3 *7\n\nSo sqrt(3024) = 4 *3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21)\n\nTherefore, the area is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, the area of triangle ABC is 6 sqrt(21). Since the opposite face is congruent, the area of triangle ADC is also 6 sqrt(21). Wait, no, wait: in a disphenoid, the opposite faces are congruent. So, if ABC is one face, the opposite face is ADC? Or is it BCD?\n\nWait, no, in a tetrahedron, each face has an opposite face. So, ABC is opposite to D, and BCD is opposite to A.\n\nWait, maybe I should confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pair of opposite faces are congruent. So, the two faces ABC and ADC are congruent, and the other two faces ABD and BCD are congruent.\n\nWait, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe all four faces are congruent, but in this case, given the edge lengths, I don't think so.\n\nWait, in our case, the edges are:\n\nAB=CD= sqrt(41)\n\nAC=BD= sqrt(80)\n\nBC=AD= sqrt(89)\n\nSo, in the face ABC, the edges are AB, BC, AC.\n\nIn face ABD, the edges are AB, BD, AD.\n\nSo, in face ABC: sides sqrt(41), sqrt(89), sqrt(80)\n\nIn face ABD: sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89)\n\nSo, the two faces ABC and ABD have the same side lengths, just in different order. Therefore, they are congruent.\n\nSimilarly, faces BCD and ACD would also be congruent.\n\nSo, there are two pairs of congruent triangular faces.\n\nSo, the surface area S is 2*(area of ABC) + 2*(area of ABD). Wait, but since ABC and ABD are congruent, actually, S = 4*(area of ABC). But wait, no, because each face is only counted once.\n\nWait, no, in reality, the four faces are ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD.\n\nGiven the edge lengths, each face has two sides from the \"same\" pair and one from another.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the area of two different triangles and then double each.\n\nWait, but since I already computed the area of ABC as 6 sqrt(21), let me compute the area of another face, say ABD.\n\nFace ABD: points A, B, D.\n\nVectors AB and AD.\n\nWait, vectors AB = (-4, -5, 0), AD = D - A = (0, -5, -8).\n\nCompute cross product AB \u00d7 AD.\n\nAB \u00d7 AD = |i    j     k|\n           |-4   -5     0|\n           | 0   -5    -8|\n\n= i [ (-5)(-8) - 0*(-5) ] - j [ (-4)(-8) - 0*0 ] + k [ (-4)(-5) - (-5)*0 ]\n\n= i [40 - 0] - j [32 - 0] + k [20 - 0]\n\n= 40i -32j +20k\n\nThe magnitude is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + 20\u00b2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024) again.\n\nSo, same as before, sqrt(3024) = 12 sqrt(21). Therefore, area is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21).\n\nSo, both ABC and ABD have the same area. Therefore, all four faces have the same area? Wait, that can't be right because in a disphenoid, the opposite faces are congruent, but not necessarily all four.\n\nWait, but according to the calculations, both ABC and ABD have the same area. Hmm, perhaps in this case, all four faces are congruent. Let me check the lengths of the edges of face ACD.\n\nFace ACD: points A, C, D.\n\nEdges AC = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41), AD = sqrt(89)\n\nSo, sides sqrt(80), sqrt(41), sqrt(89), same as ABC. So, yes, all four faces have the same side lengths, hence are congruent. Therefore, all four faces have the same area, 6 sqrt(21).\n\nWait, so total surface area S = 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21).\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, if all four faces are congruent, then each has the same area, so yes, S = 4 * (area of one face). So, if area of ABC is 6 sqrt(21), then S = 24 sqrt(21).\n\nBut wait, when I computed the cross product for ABC, I got 6 sqrt(21). Let me confirm the cross product.\n\nFor ABC:\n\nAB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024). 3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 144 * 21. So sqrt(3024)=12 sqrt(21). So, half of that is 6 sqrt(21). So yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, each face has area 6 sqrt(21), so total surface area S = 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21).\n\nNow, the inradius formula is r = 3V / S.\n\nSo, plugging in V = 160/3 and S = 24 sqrt(21):\n\nr = 3*(160/3) / (24 sqrt(21)) ) = (160) / (24 sqrt(21)) = (160)/(24 sqrt(21)).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8: 20 / (3 sqrt(21)).\n\nRationalize the denominator: 20 sqrt(21) / (3 * 21) = (20 sqrt(21))/63.\n\nSo, r = (20 sqrt(21))/63.\n\nThe problem states that the distance can be written as m sqrt(n)/p, where m and p are coprime, and n is square-free.\n\nHere, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nWait, but 20 and 63 are coprime? Let's see: factors of 20 are 2,4,5,10,20; factors of 63 are 3,7,9,21,63. No common factors except 1. So yes, m and p are coprime.\n\nAnd 21 is 3*7, which is square-free. So yes, that's the form.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63. Then, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the inradius formula. I thought it was r = 3V/S, but let me confirm.\n\nYes, for a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius is indeed r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers, 3*(160/3) = 160, then 160 divided by (24 sqrt(21)) is 160/(24 sqrt(21)).\n\nSimplify 160/24: divide numerator and denominator by 8, get 20/3.\n\nSo, 20/(3 sqrt(21)) = (20 sqrt(21))/(3*21) = (20 sqrt(21))/63.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, r = 20 sqrt(21)/63.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nTherefore, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but 63 can be simplified? 63 is 7*9, which is 7*3\u00b2. Wait, but in the fraction, it's 20/63. 20 and 63 are coprime, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, the answer is 104.\n\n\nThe given tetrahedron \\(ABCD\\) has edge lengths \\(AB = CD = \\sqrt{41}\\), \\(AC = BD = \\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(BC = AD = \\sqrt{89}\\). To find the distance from the incenter \\(I\\) to each face, we calculate the volume \\(V\\) and the total surface area \\(S\\) of the tetrahedron.\n\nFirst, we place the vertices in a coordinate system to simplify calculations. By symmetry, we assign coordinates to the vertices such that:\n- \\(A = (2, \\frac{5}{2}, 4)\\)\n- \\(B = (-2, -\\frac{5}{2}, 4)\\)\n- \\(C = (-2, \\frac{5}{2}, -4)\\)\n- \\(D = (2, -\\frac{5}{2}, -4)\\)\n\nUsing these coordinates, we compute the volume \\(V\\) using the scalar triple product:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{6} \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n-4 & -4 & 0 \\\\\n-5 & 0 & -5 \\\\\n0 & -8 & -8\n\\end{pmatrix} \\right| = \\frac{320}{6} = \\frac{160}{3}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total surface area \\(S\\). Each face is a triangle with sides \\(\\sqrt{41}\\), \\(\\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{89}\\). Using the cross product, the area of one face is found to be \\(6\\sqrt{21}\\). Since all four faces are congruent, the total surface area is:\n\\[\nS = 4 \\times 6\\sqrt{21} = 24\\sqrt{21}\n\\]\n\nThe inradius \\(r\\) is given by:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{3V}{S} = \\frac{3 \\times \\frac{160}{3}}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{160}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}\n\\]\n\nThus, the distance from \\(I\\) to each face is \\(\\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}\\). The values \\(m = 20\\), \\(n = 21\\), and \\(p = 63\\) satisfy the given conditions, so \\(m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{104}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer should be in the form m\u221an / p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then I have to find m + n + p.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:\n\nr = 3V / S,\n\nwhere V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I need to compute V and S.\n\nBut wait, how do I compute the volume of a tetrahedron with these edge lengths? Since all opposite edges are equal, this tetrahedron is called isohedral? Or maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:\n\nVolume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the following matrix:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   a\u00b2   b\u00b2   c\u00b2 |\n| 1  a\u00b2   0    d\u00b2   e\u00b2 |\n| 1  b\u00b2  d\u00b2    0    f\u00b2 |\n| 1  c\u00b2  e\u00b2   f\u00b2    0  |\n\nSo, I need to assign the given edge lengths to a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\nWait, let's clarify the edge lengths:\n\nGiven:\nAB = CD = sqrt(41) => AB\u00b2 = 41, CD\u00b2 =41\nAC = BD = sqrt(80) => AC\u00b2=80, BD\u00b2=80\nBC = AD = sqrt(89) => BC\u00b2=89, AD\u00b2=89\n\nSo, in terms of the Cayley-Menger matrix:\n\na = AB = sqrt(41) => a\u00b2 =41\nb = AC = sqrt(80) => b\u00b2=80\nc = AD = sqrt(89) => c\u00b2=89\nd = BC = sqrt(89) => d\u00b2=89\ne = BD = sqrt(80) => e\u00b2=80\nf = CD = sqrt(41) => f\u00b2=41\n\nSo, the matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm putting them correctly.\n\nWait, the Cayley-Menger determinant is a 5x5 matrix. The first row is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Then each subsequent row starts with 1, followed by 0, then the squares of the edges connected to that vertex.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the vertices as A, B, C, D, and the matrix is constructed accordingly.\n\nWait, let me double-check the exact structure of the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for points A, B, C, D is a 5x5 matrix where the first row is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1], the first column is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]^T, and the diagonal from (2,2) to (5,5) is zero, with the other entries being the squares of the distances between the points.\n\nSo, the matrix is:\n\n[ 0    1      1      1      1   ]\n\n[ 1    0    AB\u00b2   AC\u00b2   AD\u00b2 ]\n\n[ 1  AB\u00b2    0    BC\u00b2   BD\u00b2 ]\n\n[ 1  AC\u00b2  BC\u00b2     0    CD\u00b2 ]\n\n[ 1  AD\u00b2  BD\u00b2   CD\u00b2     0   ]\n\nSo, substituting the given squared lengths:\n\nAB\u00b2 = 41, AC\u00b2=80, AD\u00b2=89\n\nBC\u00b2=89, BD\u00b2=80, CD\u00b2=41\n\nSo, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]\n\nRow 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]\n\nRow 3: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]\n\nRow 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]\n\nNow, I need to compute the determinant of this matrix. That's a bit of work, but let's proceed step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or symmetry that can simplify the calculation.\n\nLooking at the matrix, it seems symmetric across the main diagonal. So perhaps it's a symmetric matrix. Let me check:\n\nRow 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]\n\nRow 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]\n\nRow 3: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]\n\nRow 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]\n\nYes, each row is a permutation of the others in terms of the numbers 41, 80, 89. So, the matrix is symmetric.\n\nGiven the symmetry, perhaps the determinant can be simplified by some row or column operations.\n\nBut computing a 5x5 determinant is quite involved. Alternatively, maybe I can use some properties of the tetrahedron.\n\nWait, another approach: if the tetrahedron is such that opposite edges are equal, it's called a disphenoid. In a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles. So, perhaps all faces are congruent, which would make sense given the edge lengths.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal, which is exactly the case here: AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC. So yes, it's a disphenoid.\n\nIn a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / (6\u221a2)\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. Alternatively, for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula involving the edge lengths.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use another approach. Since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system in a symmetric way.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the vertices such that the centroid is at the origin, and the coordinates are symmetric.\n\nLet me suppose that points A, B, C, D are such that:\n\nA = (x, y, z)\n\nB = (-x, -y, z)\n\nC = (-x, y, -z)\n\nD = (x, -y, -z)\n\nThis kind of symmetry might work because flipping signs would give the equal opposite edges.\n\nLet me check: The distance between A and B would be sqrt( (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0^2 ) = sqrt(4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2). Similarly, distance CD is sqrt( (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 ). Wait, no, let me compute AB and CD.\n\nWait, with the coordinates I've assigned:\n\nAB: distance between A (x, y, z) and B (-x, -y, z).\n\nSo, AB^2 = (x - (-x))\u00b2 + (y - (-y))\u00b2 + (z - z)^2 = (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 = 4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, CD is between C (-x, y, -z) and D (x, -y, -z):\n\nCD^2 = ( -x - x )\u00b2 + ( y - (-y) )\u00b2 + ( -z - (-z) )\u00b2 = (-2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 = 4x\u00b2 +4y\u00b2. So, AB\u00b2=CD\u00b2=4x\u00b2 +4y\u00b2=41.\n\nSimilarly, AC is between A (x,y,z) and C (-x, y, -z):\n\nAC^2 = (x - (-x))\u00b2 + (y - y)^2 + (z - (-z))\u00b2 = (2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2 = 4x\u00b2 +4z\u00b2. Given that AC\u00b2=80.\n\nSimilarly, BD is between B (-x,-y,z) and D (x,-y,-z):\n\nBD^2 = ( -x -x )\u00b2 + ( -y - (-y) )\u00b2 + (z - (-z))\u00b2 = (-2x)^2 +0 + (2z)^2 =4x\u00b2 +4z\u00b2. So, BD\u00b2=4x\u00b2 +4z\u00b2=80.\n\nSimilarly, BC is between B (-x,-y,z) and C (-x, y, -z):\n\nBC^2 = ( -x - (-x) )\u00b2 + ( -y - y )\u00b2 + (z - (-z))\u00b2 = 0 + (-2y)^2 + (2z)^2 =4y\u00b2 +4z\u00b2. Given that BC\u00b2=89.\n\nSimilarly, AD is between A (x,y,z) and D (x,-y,-z):\n\nAD^2 = (x - x)^2 + (y - (-y))^2 + (z - (-z))^2 =0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2=4y\u00b2 +4z\u00b2=89.\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\n1. 4x\u00b2 +4y\u00b2 =41\n\n2. 4x\u00b2 +4z\u00b2=80\n\n3. 4y\u00b2 +4z\u00b2=89\n\nLet me write these as:\n\n1. x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n\n2. x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 80/4=20\n\n3. y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 10.25\n\nEquation 2: x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =20\n\nEquation 3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =22.25\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(equation 2 - equation1): (x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =20 -10.25 => z\u00b2 - y\u00b2=9.75\n\nSimilarly, equation3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=22.25\n\nSo, we have:\n\nz\u00b2 - y\u00b2=9.75\n\nz\u00b2 + y\u00b2=22.25\n\nLet me add these two equations:\n\n2z\u00b2= 32 => z\u00b2=16 => z=4 or z=-4\n\nThen, from equation 3: y\u00b2 +16=22.25 => y\u00b2=6.25 => y=2.5 or y=-2.5\n\nFrom equation1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=10.25 => x\u00b2=10.25 -6.25=4 => x=2 or x=-2\n\nSo, x=\u00b12, y=\u00b12.5, z=\u00b14.\n\nSo, the coordinates are:\n\nA=(2, 2.5,4)\n\nB=(-2, -2.5,4)\n\nC=(-2, 2.5,-4)\n\nD=(2, -2.5,-4)\n\nWait, let me check the distances to confirm.\n\nCompute AB: between (2,2.5,4) and (-2,-2.5,4):\n\ndx=4, dy=5, dz=0.\n\nAB\u00b2=4\u00b2 +5\u00b2 +0=16+25=41. Correct.\n\nAC: between (2,2.5,4) and (-2,2.5,-4):\n\ndx=4, dy=0, dz=8.\n\nAC\u00b2=16 +0 +64=80. Correct.\n\nAD: between (2,2.5,4) and (2,-2.5,-4):\n\ndx=0, dy=5, dz=8.\n\nAD\u00b2=0 +25 +64=89. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, CD: between (-2,2.5,-4) and (2,-2.5,-4):\n\ndx=4, dy=5, dz=0.\n\nCD\u00b2=16 +25 +0=41. Correct.\n\nBD: between (-2,-2.5,4) and (2,-2.5,-4):\n\ndx=4, dy=0, dz=8.\n\nBD\u00b2=16 +0 +64=80. Correct.\n\nBC: between (-2,-2.5,4) and (-2,2.5,-4):\n\ndx=0, dy=5, dz=8.\n\nBC\u00b2=0 +25 +64=89. Correct.\n\nSo, the coordinates are correctly assigned.\n\nNow that I have coordinates for all four points, I can compute the volume using the scalar triple product.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a tetrahedron given coordinates is V = | (AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD)) | / 6.\n\nBut wait, let's define vectors based at point A.\n\nVectors AB, AC, AD can be represented as:\n\nAB = B - A = (-2 -2, -2.5 -2.5, 4 -4) = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nWait, no, wait: point A is (2, 2.5,4), point B is (-2, -2.5,4).\n\nSo, vector AB = B - A = (-2 -2, -2.5 -2.5, 4 -4) = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nSimilarly, vector AC = C - A = (-2 -2, 2.5 -2.5, -4 -4) = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nVector AD = D - A = (2 -2, -2.5 -2.5, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8)\n\nSo, vectors AB=(-4, -5, 0), AC=(-4, 0, -8), AD=(0, -5, -8)\n\nNow, compute the cross product AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nAC \u00d7 AD = |i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-4 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a0-8\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a0-5 \u00a0\u00a0-8\n\n= i*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)\n\n= i*(0 - 40) - j*(32 - 0) + k*(20 - 0)\n\n= (-40i -32j +20k)\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nNow, compute AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD):\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nDot product with (-40, -32, 20) is:\n\n(-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 +160 +0=320.\n\nSo, the scalar triple product is 320. Therefore, the volume V is |320| /6 =320/6=160/3.\n\nSo, V=160/3.\n\nNext, I need to find the total surface area S.\n\nSince all faces are congruent triangles, but wait, is that true? Wait, in a disphenoid, all faces are congruent if it's a regular tetrahedron, but in this case, the faces might not be congruent. Wait, in a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal, but faces can be congruent in pairs.\n\nWait, let me check the face areas.\n\nEach face is a triangle with sides of lengths sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89).\n\nWait, no, because each face is a triangle formed by three edges.\n\nWait, for example, face ABC: edges AB=\u221a41, AC=\u221a80, BC=\u221a89.\n\nSimilarly, face ABD: edges AB=\u221a41, AD=\u221a89, BD=\u221a80.\n\nFace ACD: edges AC=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89, CD=\u221a41.\n\nFace BCD: edges BC=\u221a89, BD=\u221a80, CD=\u221a41.\n\nSo, each face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. So, all four faces are congruent triangles.\n\nTherefore, all four faces have the same area. So, if I compute the area of one face and multiply by four, I get the total surface area.\n\nSo, let's compute the area of triangle ABC with sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nI can use Heron's formula.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nBut since all sides are square roots, it's easier to compute s squared or perhaps use another formula.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula for area when you know all three sides: Heron's formula.\n\nBut let's compute s:\n\ns = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2\n\nHmm, that might be messy. Alternatively, since all four faces are congruent, perhaps compute the area using vectors.\n\nAlternatively, since I have coordinates, I can compute the area of one face and then multiply by four.\n\nLet's compute the area of triangle ABC.\n\nPoints A(2,2.5,4), B(-2,-2.5,4), C(-2,2.5,-4).\n\nVectors AB and AC can be used to compute the area as half the magnitude of the cross product.\n\nWait, vectors AB and AC are from point A. Alternatively, vectors AB and AC can be used as edges from A.\n\nWait, vectors AB and AC are:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCompute AB \u00d7 AC:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n|-4 \u00a0\u00a0-5 \u00a0\u00a00|\n|-4 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a0-8|\n\n= i*( (-5)*(-8) - 0*0 ) - j*( (-4)*(-8) - 0*(-4) ) + k*( (-4)*0 - (-5)*(-4) )\n\n= i*(40 -0) - j*(32 -0) + k*(0 -20)\n\n= (40i -32j -20k)\n\nThe magnitude of this cross product is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 )= sqrt(1600 +1024 +400)=sqrt(3024).\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024). Let's factor 3024:\n\n3024 \u00f7 16 = 189. So, 3024=16*189.\n\n189=9*21=9*3*7.\n\nSo, sqrt(3024)=sqrt(16*9*21)=4*3*sqrt(21)=12\u221a21.\n\nSo, the magnitude is 12\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12\u221a21=6\u221a21.\n\nSince all four faces are congruent, total surface area S=4*6\u221a21=24\u221a21.\n\nSo, S=24\u221a21.\n\nNow, inradius r= 3V / S = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21 )= (160) / (24\u221a21 )\n\nSimplify 160/24: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 20/3.\n\nSo, r= (20/3) / \u221a21 = (20)/(3\u221a21 )\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\n(20)/(3\u221a21 ) * (\u221a21/\u221a21 )= (20\u221a21)/(3*21)= (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nSo, r=20\u221a21 /63.\n\nSimplify: 20 and 63 have a common factor? 20 is 2*2*5, 63 is 7*3*3. No common factors, so m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nWait, but 63 can be reduced with 20? No, because 20 and 63 are coprime.\n\nWait, 20\u221a21 /63 is the simplified form.\n\nBut let me check if the fraction can be reduced further. 20 and 63 share no common factors, correct.\n\nAnd 21 is square-free (prime factors 3 and 7, both to the first power). So yes, n=21.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nTherefore, m +n +p=20+21+63=104.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check my steps because 20/63 is correct?\n\nWait, let's retrace.\n\nr=3V/S.\n\nV=160/3.\n\nS=24\u221a21.\n\nSo, 3V=3*(160/3)=160.\n\nr=160/(24\u221a21 )= (160/24)/\u221a21= (20/3)/\u221a21=20/(3\u221a21)=20\u221a21/(3*21)=20\u221a21/63.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nSum is 20+21+63=104.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me confirm the surface area.\n\nI computed the area of triangle ABC as 6\u221a21.\n\nBut let me cross-verify that.\n\nUsing Heron's formula:\n\na=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\ns=(\u221a41 +\u221a80 +\u221a89)/2.\n\nBut computing the area using Heron's formula is going to be complicated, but perhaps I can use another method.\n\nAlternatively, since I have vectors AB and AC, and their cross product's magnitude is 12\u221a21, the area is 6\u221a21. So that seems correct.\n\nSo, yes, S=24\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, the inradius is 20\u221a21 /63.\n\nSo, the answer is 20+21+63=104.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer should be in the form m\u221an / p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then I have to find m + n + p.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:\n\nr = 3V / S,\n\nwhere V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I need to compute V and S.\n\nBut wait, how do I compute the volume of a tetrahedron with these edge lengths? Since all opposite edges are equal, this tetrahedron is called isohedral? Or maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:\n\nVolume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the following matrix:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   a\u00b2   b\u00b2   c\u00b2 |\n| 1  a\u00b2   0    d\u00b2   e\u00b2 |\n| 1  b\u00b2  d\u00b2    0    f\u00b2 |\n| 1  c\u00b2  e\u00b2   f\u00b2    0  |\n\nSo, I need to assign the given edge lengths to a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\nWait, let's clarify the edge lengths:\n\nGiven:\nAB = CD = sqrt(41) => AB\u00b2 = 41, CD\u00b2 =41\nAC = BD = sqrt(80) => AC\u00b2=80, BD\u00b2=80\nBC = AD = sqrt(89) => BC\u00b2=89, AD\u00b2=89\n\nSo, in terms of the Cayley-Menger matrix:\n\na = AB = sqrt(41) => a\u00b2 =41\nb = AC = sqrt(80) => b\u00b2=80\nc = AD = sqrt(89) => c\u00b2=89\nd = BC = sqrt(89) => d\u00b2=89\ne = BD = sqrt(80) => e\u00b2=80\nf = CD = sqrt(41) => f\u00b2=41\n\nSo, the matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm putting them correctly.\n\nWait, the Cayley-Menger determinant is a 5x5 matrix. The first row is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Then each subsequent row starts with 1, followed by 0, then the squares of the edges connected to that vertex.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the vertices as A, B, C, D, and the matrix is constructed accordingly.\n\nWait, let me double-check the exact structure of the Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for points A, B, C, D is a 5x5 matrix where the first row is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1], the first column is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]^T, and the diagonal from (2,2) to (5,5) is zero, with the other entries being the squares of the distances between the points.\n\nSo, the matrix is:\n\n[ 0    1      1      1      1   ]\n\n[ 1    0    AB\u00b2   AC\u00b2   AD\u00b2 ]\n\n[ 1  AB\u00b2    0    BC\u00b2   BD\u00b2 ]\n\n[ 1  AC\u00b2  BC\u00b2     0    CD\u00b2 ]\n\n[ 1  AD\u00b2  BD\u00b2   CD\u00b2     0   ]\n\nSo, substituting the given squared lengths:\n\nAB\u00b2 = 41, AC\u00b2=80, AD\u00b2=89\n\nBC\u00b2=89, BD\u00b2=80, CD\u00b2=41\n\nSo, the matrix becomes:\n\nRow 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]\n\nRow 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]\n\nRow 3: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]\n\nRow 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]\n\nNow, I need to compute the determinant of this matrix. That's a bit of work, but let's proceed step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or symmetry that can simplify the calculation.\n\nLooking at the matrix, it seems symmetric across the main diagonal. So perhaps it's a symmetric matrix. Let me check:\n\nRow 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]\n\nRow 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]\n\nRow 3: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]\n\nRow 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]\n\nYes, each row is a permutation of the others in terms of the numbers 41, 80, 89. So, the matrix is symmetric.\n\nGiven the symmetry, perhaps the determinant can be simplified by some row or column operations.\n\nBut computing a 5x5 determinant is quite involved. Alternatively, maybe I can use some properties of the tetrahedron.\n\nWait, another approach: if the tetrahedron is such that opposite edges are equal, it's called a disphenoid. In a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles. So, perhaps all faces are congruent, which would make sense given the edge lengths.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal, which is exactly the case here: AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC. So yes, it's a disphenoid.\n\nIn a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / (6\u221a2)\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. Alternatively, for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula involving the edge lengths.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use another approach. Since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system in a symmetric way.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the vertices such that the centroid is at the origin, and the coordinates are symmetric.\n\nLet me suppose that points A, B, C, D are such that:\n\nA = (x, y, z)\n\nB = (-x, -y, z)\n\nC = (-x, y, -z)\n\nD = (x, -y, -z)\n\nThis kind of symmetry might work because flipping signs would give the equal opposite edges.\n\nLet me check: The distance between A and B would be sqrt( (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0^2 ) = sqrt(4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2). Similarly, distance CD is sqrt( (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 ). Wait, no, let me compute AB and CD.\n\nWait, with the coordinates I've assigned:\n\nAB: distance between A (x, y, z) and B (-x, -y, z).\n\nSo, AB^2 = (x - (-x))\u00b2 + (y - (-y))\u00b2 + (z - z)^2 = (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 = 4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, CD is between C (-x, y, -z) and D (x, -y, -z):\n\nCD^2 = ( -x - x )\u00b2 + ( y - (-y) )\u00b2 + ( -z - (-z) )\u00b2 = (-2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 = 4x\u00b2 +4y\u00b2. So, AB\u00b2=CD\u00b2=4x\u00b2 +4y\u00b2=41.\n\nSimilarly, AC is between A (x,y,z) and C (-x, y, -z):\n\nAC^2 = (x - (-x))\u00b2 + (y - y)^2 + (z - (-z))\u00b2 = (2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2 = 4x\u00b2 +4z\u00b2. Given that AC\u00b2=80.\n\nSimilarly, BD is between B (-x,-y,z) and D (x,-y,-z):\n\nBD^2 = ( -x -x )\u00b2 + ( -y - (-y) )\u00b2 + (z - (-z))\u00b2 = (-2x)^2 +0 + (2z)^2 =4x\u00b2 +4z\u00b2. So, BD\u00b2=4x\u00b2 +4z\u00b2=80.\n\nSimilarly, BC is between B (-x,-y,z) and C (-x, y, -z):\n\nBC^2 = ( -x - (-x) )\u00b2 + ( -y - y )\u00b2 + (z - (-z))\u00b2 = 0 + (-2y)^2 + (2z)^2 =4y\u00b2 +4z\u00b2. Given that BC\u00b2=89.\n\nSimilarly, AD is between A (x,y,z) and D (x,-y,-z):\n\nAD^2 = (x - x)^2 + (y - (-y))^2 + (z - (-z))^2 =0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2=4y\u00b2 +4z\u00b2=89.\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\n1. 4x\u00b2 +4y\u00b2 =41\n\n2. 4x\u00b2 +4z\u00b2=80\n\n3. 4y\u00b2 +4z\u00b2=89\n\nLet me write these as:\n\n1. x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n\n2. x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 80/4=20\n\n3. y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 10.25\n\nEquation 2: x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =20\n\nEquation 3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =22.25\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(equation 2 - equation1): (x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =20 -10.25 => z\u00b2 - y\u00b2=9.75\n\nSimilarly, equation3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=22.25\n\nSo, we have:\n\nz\u00b2 - y\u00b2=9.75\n\nz\u00b2 + y\u00b2=22.25\n\nLet me add these two equations:\n\n2z\u00b2= 32 => z\u00b2=16 => z=4 or z=-4\n\nThen, from equation 3: y\u00b2 +16=22.25 => y\u00b2=6.25 => y=2.5 or y=-2.5\n\nFrom equation1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=10.25 => x\u00b2=10.25 -6.25=4 => x=2 or x=-2\n\nSo, x=\u00b12, y=\u00b12.5, z=\u00b14.\n\nSo, the coordinates are:\n\nA=(2, 2.5,4)\n\nB=(-2, -2.5,4)\n\nC=(-2, 2.5,-4)\n\nD=(2, -2.5,-4)\n\nWait, let me check the distances to confirm.\n\nCompute AB: between (2,2.5,4) and (-2,-2.5,4):\n\ndx=4, dy=5, dz=0.\n\nAB\u00b2=4\u00b2 +5\u00b2 +0=16+25=41. Correct.\n\nAC: between (2,2.5,4) and (-2,2.5,-4):\n\ndx=4, dy=0, dz=8.\n\nAC\u00b2=16 +0 +64=80. Correct.\n\nAD: between (2,2.5,4) and (2,-2.5,-4):\n\ndx=0, dy=5, dz=8.\n\nAD\u00b2=0 +25 +64=89. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, CD: between (-2,2.5,-4) and (2,-2.5,-4):\n\ndx=4, dy=5, dz=0.\n\nCD\u00b2=16 +25 +0=41. Correct.\n\nBD: between (-2,-2.5,4) and (2,-2.5,-4):\n\ndx=4, dy=0, dz=8.\n\nBD\u00b2=16 +0 +64=80. Correct.\n\nBC: between (-2,-2.5,4) and (-2,2.5,-4):\n\ndx=0, dy=5, dz=8.\n\nBC\u00b2=0 +25 +64=89. Correct.\n\nSo, the coordinates are correctly assigned.\n\nNow that I have coordinates for all four points, I can compute the volume using the scalar triple product.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a tetrahedron given coordinates is V = | (AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD)) | / 6.\n\nBut wait, let's define vectors based at point A.\n\nVectors AB, AC, AD can be represented as:\n\nAB = B - A = (-2 -2, -2.5 -2.5, 4 -4) = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nWait, no, wait: point A is (2, 2.5,4), point B is (-2, -2.5,4).\n\nSo, vector AB = B - A = (-2 -2, -2.5 -2.5, 4 -4) = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nSimilarly, vector AC = C - A = (-2 -2, 2.5 -2.5, -4 -4) = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nVector AD = D - A = (2 -2, -2.5 -2.5, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8)\n\nSo, vectors AB=(-4, -5, 0), AC=(-4, 0, -8), AD=(0, -5, -8)\n\nNow, compute the cross product AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nAC \u00d7 AD = |i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-4 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a0-8\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a0-5 \u00a0\u00a0-8\n\n= i*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)\n\n= i*(0 - 40) - j*(32 - 0) + k*(20 - 0)\n\n= (-40i -32j +20k)\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nNow, compute AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD):\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nDot product with (-40, -32, 20) is:\n\n(-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 +160 +0=320.\n\nSo, the scalar triple product is 320. Therefore, the volume V is |320| /6 =320/6=160/3.\n\nSo, V=160/3.\n\nNext, I need to find the total surface area S.\n\nSince all faces are congruent triangles, but wait, is that true? Wait, in a disphenoid, all faces are congruent if it's a regular tetrahedron, but in this case, the faces might not be congruent. Wait, in a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal, but faces can be congruent in pairs.\n\nWait, let me check the face areas.\n\nEach face is a triangle with sides of lengths sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89).\n\nWait, no, because each face is a triangle formed by three edges.\n\nWait, for example, face ABC: edges AB=\u221a41, AC=\u221a80, BC=\u221a89.\n\nSimilarly, face ABD: edges AB=\u221a41, AD=\u221a89, BD=\u221a80.\n\nFace ACD: edges AC=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89, CD=\u221a41.\n\nFace BCD: edges BC=\u221a89, BD=\u221a80, CD=\u221a41.\n\nSo, each face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. So, all four faces are congruent triangles.\n\nTherefore, all four faces have the same area. So, if I compute the area of one face and multiply by four, I get the total surface area.\n\nSo, let's compute the area of triangle ABC with sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nI can use Heron's formula.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nBut since all sides are square roots, it's easier to compute s squared or perhaps use another formula.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula for area when you know all three sides: Heron's formula.\n\nBut let's compute s:\n\ns = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2\n\nHmm, that might be messy. Alternatively, since all four faces are congruent, perhaps compute the area using vectors.\n\nAlternatively, since I have coordinates, I can compute the area of one face and then multiply by four.\n\nLet's compute the area of triangle ABC.\n\nPoints A(2,2.5,4), B(-2,-2.5,4), C(-2,2.5,-4).\n\nVectors AB and AC can be used to compute the area as half the magnitude of the cross product.\n\nWait, vectors AB and AC are from point A. Alternatively, vectors AB and AC can be used as edges from A.\n\nWait, vectors AB and AC are:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCompute AB \u00d7 AC:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n|-4 \u00a0\u00a0-5 \u00a0\u00a00|\n|-4 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a0-8|\n\n= i*( (-5)*(-8) - 0*0 ) - j*( (-4)*(-8) - 0*(-4) ) + k*( (-4)*0 - (-5)*(-4) )\n\n= i*(40 -0) - j*(32 -0) + k*(0 -20)\n\n= (40i -32j -20k)\n\nThe magnitude of this cross product is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 )= sqrt(1600 +1024 +400)=sqrt(3024).\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024). Let's factor 3024:\n\n3024 \u00f7 16 = 189. So, 3024=16*189.\n\n189=9*21=9*3*7.\n\nSo, sqrt(3024)=sqrt(16*9*21)=4*3*sqrt(21)=12\u221a21.\n\nSo, the magnitude is 12\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12\u221a21=6\u221a21.\n\nSince all four faces are congruent, total surface area S=4*6\u221a21=24\u221a21.\n\nSo, S=24\u221a21.\n\nNow, inradius r= 3V / S = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21 )= (160) / (24\u221a21 )\n\nSimplify 160/24: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 20/3.\n\nSo, r= (20/3) / \u221a21 = (20)/(3\u221a21 )\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\n(20)/(3\u221a21 ) * (\u221a21/\u221a21 )= (20\u221a21)/(3*21)= (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nSo, r=20\u221a21 /63.\n\nSimplify: 20 and 63 have a common factor? 20 is 2*2*5, 63 is 7*3*3. No common factors, so m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nWait, but 63 can be reduced with 20? No, because 20 and 63 are coprime.\n\nWait, 20\u221a21 /63 is the simplified form.\n\nBut let me check if the fraction can be reduced further. 20 and 63 share no common factors, correct.\n\nAnd 21 is square-free (prime factors 3 and 7, both to the first power). So yes, n=21.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nTherefore, m +n +p=20+21+63=104.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check my steps because 20/63 is correct?\n\nWait, let's retrace.\n\nr=3V/S.\n\nV=160/3.\n\nS=24\u221a21.\n\nSo, 3V=3*(160/3)=160.\n\nr=160/(24\u221a21 )= (160/24)/\u221a21= (20/3)/\u221a21=20/(3\u221a21)=20\u221a21/(3*21)=20\u221a21/63.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nSum is 20+21+63=104.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me confirm the surface area.\n\nI computed the area of triangle ABC as 6\u221a21.\n\nBut let me cross-verify that.\n\nUsing Heron's formula:\n\na=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\ns=(\u221a41 +\u221a80 +\u221a89)/2.\n\nBut computing the area using Heron's formula is going to be complicated, but perhaps I can use another method.\n\nAlternatively, since I have vectors AB and AC, and their cross product's magnitude is 12\u221a21, the area is 6\u221a21. So that seems correct.\n\nSo, yes, S=24\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, the inradius is 20\u221a21 /63.\n\nSo, the answer is 20+21+63=104.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid with opposite edges equal. We use the Cayley-Menger determinant to compute the volume and find the inradius.\n\nFirst, we assign coordinates to the vertices of the tetrahedron based on the given edge lengths, ensuring symmetry. Using these coordinates, we compute the vectors and use the scalar triple product to find the volume \\( V = \\frac{160}{3} \\).\n\nNext, we calculate the total surface area \\( S \\). Each face is a congruent triangle with sides \\( \\sqrt{41} \\), \\( \\sqrt{80} \\), and \\( \\sqrt{89} \\). Using the cross product of vectors, we find the area of one face to be \\( 6\\sqrt{21} \\), leading to a total surface area \\( S = 24\\sqrt{21} \\).\n\nThe inradius \\( r \\) is then computed using the formula \\( r = \\frac{3V}{S} \\), resulting in \\( r = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63} \\). Simplifying, we find \\( m = 20 \\), \\( n = 21 \\), and \\( p = 63 \\). Summing these values gives \\( m + n + p = 104 \\).\n\n\\boxed{104}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance is supposed to be in the form m\u221an/p, and then I have to find m + n + p.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the tetrahedron. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces, and the incenter is the point inside where the distances to each face are equal. This point is similar to the incenter in a triangle but extended to three dimensions.\n\nGiven the edge lengths:\n- AB = CD = \u221a41\n- AC = BD = \u221a80\n- BC = AD = \u221a89\n\nHmm, I notice that opposite edges are equal. That suggests the tetrahedron might be \"isohedral\" or at least symmetric in some way. Maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron, which would be helpful because symmetry might make calculations easier.\n\nSince all opposite edges are equal, this tetrahedron is called \"equifacial\" or maybe \"isosceles.\" I remember that in such cases, all faces are congruent, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, equifacial means all faces are congruent, but here only opposite edges are equal. So maybe it's a \"kite tetrahedron,\" but I'm not certain. Maybe I should check the properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, which makes it a \"disphenoid.\" Yes, I think that's the term. A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. So, in this case, since AB=CD, AC=BD, and BC=AD, it's a disphenoid.\n\nDisphenoids have some nice properties. For example, all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, is that true? Let me think. If all opposite edges are equal, then each face would have edges of the same lengths, but does that mean all faces are congruent?\n\nWait, let's check. Each face is a triangle. For example, face ABC has edges AB, BC, AC. The lengths are \u221a41, \u221a89, \u221a80. Similarly, face ABD has edges AB, BD, AD, which are \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. So, each face has the same set of edge lengths, which are \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. Therefore, all faces are congruent triangles. So, the tetrahedron is a disphenoid with congruent faces.\n\nThat's useful because it tells me that the volume can be calculated in a way that might be simpler, and perhaps the inradius can be found using some symmetric properties.\n\nNow, to find the inradius, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius r is related to the volume V and the surface area S by the formula:\n\nr = 3V / S\n\nWhere S is the total surface area. Wait, but in a tetrahedron, each face is a triangle, so S would be 4 times the area of one face since all faces are congruent.\n\nSo, first, I need to compute the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S.\n\nLet me compute the area of one face first. Let's pick face ABC with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89.\n\nWait, let's compute the area of triangle ABC using Heron's formula.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter (s) of triangle ABC:\n\ns = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89) / 2\n\nBut that looks complicated. Maybe there's a better way, considering that all faces are congruent triangles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the volume using the formula for a disphenoid. I recall that in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt[(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)]) / (8*sqrt(2))\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, maybe I can use the formula for the volume in terms of edge lengths.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to realize that in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 - b^2 + c^2)(-a^2 + b^2 + c^2) )) / (6*sqrt(2))\n\nWait, I might be mixing up formulas here. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to compute the volume.\n\nSince it's a disphenoid, it might be possible to assign coordinates to the vertices in such a way that the centroid is at the origin, or symmetrically placed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that in a disphenoid, the opposite edges are equal, so the tetrahedron can be embedded in such a way that the coordinates are symmetric.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the vertices.\n\nLet me set point A at (x, y, z), point B at (-x, -y, z), point C at (-x, y, -z), and point D at (x, -y, -z). This setup ensures that opposite edges are equal, which might satisfy the given edge lengths.\n\nLet me check the distances between these points.\n\nFirst, compute AB:\n\nPoint A: (x, y, z)\nPoint B: (-x, -y, z)\n\nDistance AB: sqrt[ (x + x)^2 + (y + y)^2 + (z - z)^2 ] = sqrt[ (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 ] = sqrt(4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nGiven AB = \u221a41, so 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = \u221a41 => sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = \u221a41 / 2 => x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nSimilarly, compute AC:\n\nPoint A: (x, y, z)\nPoint C: (-x, y, -z)\n\nDistance AC: sqrt[ (x + x)^2 + (y - y)^2 + (z + z)^2 ] = sqrt[ (2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2 ] = sqrt(4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2)\n\nGiven AC = \u221a80, so 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = \u221a80 => sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = \u221a80 / 2 => x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 80/4 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, compute AD:\n\nPoint A: (x, y, z)\nPoint D: (x, -y, -z)\n\nDistance AD: sqrt[ (x - x)^2 + (y + y)^2 + (z + z)^2 ] = sqrt[ 0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 ] = sqrt(4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)\n\nGiven AD = \u221a89, so 2*sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = \u221a89 => sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = \u221a89 / 2 => y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo now, I have three equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n2. x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\n3. y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nI can solve these equations for x\u00b2, y\u00b2, z\u00b2.\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 3:\n\n(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = (89/4) - (41/4)\nz\u00b2 - x\u00b2 = (89 - 41)/4 = 48/4 = 12\nSo, z\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 12.\n\nFrom equation 2: x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\nSubstitute z\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 12 into equation 2:\nx\u00b2 + (x\u00b2 + 12) = 20\n2x\u00b2 + 12 = 20\n2x\u00b2 = 8\nx\u00b2 = 4 => x = 2 or x = -2.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 4. Then, from equation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4 => 4 + y\u00b2 = 41/4 => y\u00b2 = 41/4 - 16/4 = 25/4 => y = 5/2 or y = -5/2.\n\nFrom z\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 12 => z\u00b2 = 4 + 12 = 16 => z = 4 or z = -4.\n\nSo, the coordinates are:\n\nA: (2, 5/2, 4)\nB: (-2, -5/2, 4)\nC: (-2, 5/2, -4)\nD: (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nWait, let me confirm the coordinates:\n\n- A: (x, y, z) = (2, 5/2, 4)\n- B: (-x, -y, z) = (-2, -5/2, 4)\n- C: (-x, y, -z) = (-2, 5/2, -4)\n- D: (x, -y, -z) = (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron using the scalar triple product formula.\n\nThe formula for the volume V is | (AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD)) | / 6.\n\nWait, no, actually, more accurately, if I have four points A, B, C, D, then the volume is |det(B - A, C - A, D - A)| / 6.\n\nSo, let me compute vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nWait, actually, vectors from A to B, A to C, A to D.\n\nWait, point A is (2, 5/2, 4). So, vector AB is B - A = (-2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, 4 - 4) = (-4, -5, 0).\n\nVector AC is C - A = (-2 - 2, 5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (-4, 0, -8).\n\nVector AD is D - A = (2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (0, -5, -8).\n\nSo, the vectors are:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nNow, the volume is | (AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD)) | / 6.\n\nFirst, compute the cross product AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nLet me write AC = (-4, 0, -8) and AD = (0, -5, -8).\n\nThe cross product is:\n\n|i    j     k|\n|-4   0    -8|\n|0   -5    -8|\n\n= i*(0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) - j*(-4*(-8) - 0*(-8)) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni: 0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8) = 0 - 40 = -40\nj: - [ (-4)*(-8) - 0*(-8) ) ] = - [ 32 - 0 ] = -32\nk: (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 = 20\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nNow, compute AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD):\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nDot product with (-40, -32, 20):\n\n= (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20\n= 160 + 160 + 0\n= 320\n\nSo, the volume V = |320| / 6 = 320 / 6 = 160/3.\n\nWait, that seems a bit large, but let's check the computations again.\n\nWait, cross product computation:\n\nAC \u00d7 AD:\n\ni component: (0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) = 0 - 40 = -40\nj component: - [ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ) ] = - [32 - 0] = -32\nk component: (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 = 20\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD) = (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*(20) = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320.\n\nSo V = 320 / 6 = 160 / 3.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, the volume is 160/3.\n\nNext, compute the surface area S.\n\nSince all four faces are congruent, I can compute the area of one face and multiply by 4.\n\nLet's compute the area of face ABC.\n\nWe can use Heron's formula. The sides are AB = \u221a41, AC = \u221a80, BC = \u221a89.\n\nWait, but in triangle ABC, sides are AB = \u221a41, BC = \u221a89, and AC = \u221a80.\n\nSo, the semi-perimeter s = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2.\n\nBut that's going to be complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area using vectors.\n\nSince I have coordinates for points A, B, and C, I can compute vectors AB and AC, then compute the cross product and get the area.\n\nWait, I already have vectors AB and AC from earlier.\n\nWait, point A: (2, 5/2, 4)\nPoint B: (-2, -5/2, 4)\nPoint C: (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nVectors AB = B - A = (-4, -5, 0)\nVector AC = C - A = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nThe area of triangle ABC is (1/2) |AB \u00d7 AC|.\n\nCompute AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCross product AB \u00d7 AC:\n\n|i    j     k|\n|-4   -5     0|\n|-4    0    -8|\n\n= i*(-5*(-8) - 0*0) - j*(-4*(-8) - 0*(-4)) + k*(-4*0 - (-5)*(-4))\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni: (-5)*(-8) - 0*0 = 40 - 0 = 40\nj: - [ (-4)*(-8) - 0*(-4) ) ] = - [32 - 0] = -32\nk: (-4)*0 - (-5)*(-4) = 0 - 20 = -20\n\nSo, AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)\u00b2 + (-20)\u00b2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024).\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7.\n\nSo sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12\u221a21 = 6\u221a21.\n\nSince all four faces are congruent, the total surface area S = 4 * 6\u221a21 = 24\u221a21.\n\nNow, going back to the inradius formula:\n\nr = 3V / S\n\nWe have V = 160/3, S = 24\u221a21.\n\nSo,\n\nr = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160 / (24\u221a21) = (160 \u00f7 8) / (24 \u00f7 8 * \u221a21) = 20 / (3\u221a21)\n\nSimplify this:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21:\n\nr = (20\u221a21) / (3 * 21) = (20\u221a21) / 63\n\nSimplify 20 and 63: they have a GCD of 1, so the fraction is reduced.\n\nThus, r = (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nSo, m = 20, n = 21, p = 63.\n\nWait, but 63 can be simplified with 20? Let me check. 20 and 63 share no common factors besides 1, so yes, it's reduced.\n\nBut wait, 20 and 63: 20 factors are 2,2,5; 63 is 7,3,3. No common factors, so yes, 20/63 is in simplest terms.\n\nBut n is 21, which is 3*7, so it's square-free, which satisfies the condition.\n\nSo, the distance is 20\u221a21 / 63.\n\nSo, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nFirst, the volume calculation: The vectors AB, AC, AD were correctly computed, then the cross product AC \u00d7 AD was correctly found as (-40, -32, 20). Then AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD) was 320, so volume is 320/6 = 160/3. That seems correct.\n\nThen, for the area, I used vectors AB and AC in triangle ABC. The cross product AB \u00d7 AC was (40, -32, -20), whose magnitude squared is 40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 = 1600 + 1024 + 400 = 3024. sqrt(3024) is indeed 12\u221a21, so area is 6\u221a21. Total surface area 4*6\u221a21 = 24\u221a21. Correct.\n\nThen, inradius r = 3V/S = 3*(160/3)/(24\u221a21) = 160/(24\u221a21) = 20/(3\u221a21) = (20\u221a21)/63. Correct.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance is supposed to be in the form m\u221an/p, and then I have to find m + n + p.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the tetrahedron. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces, and the incenter is the point inside where the distances to each face are equal. This point is similar to the incenter in a triangle but extended to three dimensions.\n\nGiven the edge lengths:\n- AB = CD = \u221a41\n- AC = BD = \u221a80\n- BC = AD = \u221a89\n\nHmm, I notice that opposite edges are equal. That suggests the tetrahedron might be \"isohedral\" or at least symmetric in some way. Maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron, which would be helpful because symmetry might make calculations easier.\n\nSince all opposite edges are equal, this tetrahedron is called \"equifacial\" or maybe \"isosceles.\" I remember that in such cases, all faces are congruent, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, equifacial means all faces are congruent, but here only opposite edges are equal. So maybe it's a \"kite tetrahedron,\" but I'm not certain. Maybe I should check the properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, which makes it a \"disphenoid.\" Yes, I think that's the term. A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. So, in this case, since AB=CD, AC=BD, and BC=AD, it's a disphenoid.\n\nDisphenoids have some nice properties. For example, all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, is that true? Let me think. If all opposite edges are equal, then each face would have edges of the same lengths, but does that mean all faces are congruent?\n\nWait, let's check. Each face is a triangle. For example, face ABC has edges AB, BC, AC. The lengths are \u221a41, \u221a89, \u221a80. Similarly, face ABD has edges AB, BD, AD, which are \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. So, each face has the same set of edge lengths, which are \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. Therefore, all faces are congruent triangles. So, the tetrahedron is a disphenoid with congruent faces.\n\nThat's useful because it tells me that the volume can be calculated in a way that might be simpler, and perhaps the inradius can be found using some symmetric properties.\n\nNow, to find the inradius, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius r is related to the volume V and the surface area S by the formula:\n\nr = 3V / S\n\nWhere S is the total surface area. Wait, but in a tetrahedron, each face is a triangle, so S would be 4 times the area of one face since all faces are congruent.\n\nSo, first, I need to compute the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S.\n\nLet me compute the area of one face first. Let's pick face ABC with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89.\n\nWait, let's compute the area of triangle ABC using Heron's formula.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter (s) of triangle ABC:\n\ns = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89) / 2\n\nBut that looks complicated. Maybe there's a better way, considering that all faces are congruent triangles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the volume using the formula for a disphenoid. I recall that in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt[(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)]) / (8*sqrt(2))\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, maybe I can use the formula for the volume in terms of edge lengths.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to realize that in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 - b^2 + c^2)(-a^2 + b^2 + c^2) )) / (6*sqrt(2))\n\nWait, I might be mixing up formulas here. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to compute the volume.\n\nSince it's a disphenoid, it might be possible to assign coordinates to the vertices in such a way that the centroid is at the origin, or symmetrically placed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that in a disphenoid, the opposite edges are equal, so the tetrahedron can be embedded in such a way that the coordinates are symmetric.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the vertices.\n\nLet me set point A at (x, y, z), point B at (-x, -y, z), point C at (-x, y, -z), and point D at (x, -y, -z). This setup ensures that opposite edges are equal, which might satisfy the given edge lengths.\n\nLet me check the distances between these points.\n\nFirst, compute AB:\n\nPoint A: (x, y, z)\nPoint B: (-x, -y, z)\n\nDistance AB: sqrt[ (x + x)^2 + (y + y)^2 + (z - z)^2 ] = sqrt[ (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 ] = sqrt(4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nGiven AB = \u221a41, so 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = \u221a41 => sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = \u221a41 / 2 => x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4.\n\nSimilarly, compute AC:\n\nPoint A: (x, y, z)\nPoint C: (-x, y, -z)\n\nDistance AC: sqrt[ (x + x)^2 + (y - y)^2 + (z + z)^2 ] = sqrt[ (2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2 ] = sqrt(4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2)\n\nGiven AC = \u221a80, so 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = \u221a80 => sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = \u221a80 / 2 => x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 80/4 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, compute AD:\n\nPoint A: (x, y, z)\nPoint D: (x, -y, -z)\n\nDistance AD: sqrt[ (x - x)^2 + (y + y)^2 + (z + z)^2 ] = sqrt[ 0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 ] = sqrt(4y\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)\n\nGiven AD = \u221a89, so 2*sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = \u221a89 => sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = \u221a89 / 2 => y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo now, I have three equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n2. x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\n3. y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nI can solve these equations for x\u00b2, y\u00b2, z\u00b2.\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 3:\n\n(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = (89/4) - (41/4)\nz\u00b2 - x\u00b2 = (89 - 41)/4 = 48/4 = 12\nSo, z\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 12.\n\nFrom equation 2: x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\nSubstitute z\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 12 into equation 2:\nx\u00b2 + (x\u00b2 + 12) = 20\n2x\u00b2 + 12 = 20\n2x\u00b2 = 8\nx\u00b2 = 4 => x = 2 or x = -2.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 4. Then, from equation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4 => 4 + y\u00b2 = 41/4 => y\u00b2 = 41/4 - 16/4 = 25/4 => y = 5/2 or y = -5/2.\n\nFrom z\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 12 => z\u00b2 = 4 + 12 = 16 => z = 4 or z = -4.\n\nSo, the coordinates are:\n\nA: (2, 5/2, 4)\nB: (-2, -5/2, 4)\nC: (-2, 5/2, -4)\nD: (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nWait, let me confirm the coordinates:\n\n- A: (x, y, z) = (2, 5/2, 4)\n- B: (-x, -y, z) = (-2, -5/2, 4)\n- C: (-x, y, -z) = (-2, 5/2, -4)\n- D: (x, -y, -z) = (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron using the scalar triple product formula.\n\nThe formula for the volume V is | (AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD)) | / 6.\n\nWait, no, actually, more accurately, if I have four points A, B, C, D, then the volume is |det(B - A, C - A, D - A)| / 6.\n\nSo, let me compute vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nWait, actually, vectors from A to B, A to C, A to D.\n\nWait, point A is (2, 5/2, 4). So, vector AB is B - A = (-2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, 4 - 4) = (-4, -5, 0).\n\nVector AC is C - A = (-2 - 2, 5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (-4, 0, -8).\n\nVector AD is D - A = (2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (0, -5, -8).\n\nSo, the vectors are:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nNow, the volume is | (AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD)) | / 6.\n\nFirst, compute the cross product AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nLet me write AC = (-4, 0, -8) and AD = (0, -5, -8).\n\nThe cross product is:\n\n|i    j     k|\n|-4   0    -8|\n|0   -5    -8|\n\n= i*(0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) - j*(-4*(-8) - 0*(-8)) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni: 0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8) = 0 - 40 = -40\nj: - [ (-4)*(-8) - 0*(-8) ) ] = - [ 32 - 0 ] = -32\nk: (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 = 20\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nNow, compute AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD):\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nDot product with (-40, -32, 20):\n\n= (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20\n= 160 + 160 + 0\n= 320\n\nSo, the volume V = |320| / 6 = 320 / 6 = 160/3.\n\nWait, that seems a bit large, but let's check the computations again.\n\nWait, cross product computation:\n\nAC \u00d7 AD:\n\ni component: (0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) = 0 - 40 = -40\nj component: - [ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ) ] = - [32 - 0] = -32\nk component: (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 = 20\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD) = (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*(20) = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320.\n\nSo V = 320 / 6 = 160 / 3.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, the volume is 160/3.\n\nNext, compute the surface area S.\n\nSince all four faces are congruent, I can compute the area of one face and multiply by 4.\n\nLet's compute the area of face ABC.\n\nWe can use Heron's formula. The sides are AB = \u221a41, AC = \u221a80, BC = \u221a89.\n\nWait, but in triangle ABC, sides are AB = \u221a41, BC = \u221a89, and AC = \u221a80.\n\nSo, the semi-perimeter s = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2.\n\nBut that's going to be complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area using vectors.\n\nSince I have coordinates for points A, B, and C, I can compute vectors AB and AC, then compute the cross product and get the area.\n\nWait, I already have vectors AB and AC from earlier.\n\nWait, point A: (2, 5/2, 4)\nPoint B: (-2, -5/2, 4)\nPoint C: (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nVectors AB = B - A = (-4, -5, 0)\nVector AC = C - A = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nThe area of triangle ABC is (1/2) |AB \u00d7 AC|.\n\nCompute AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCross product AB \u00d7 AC:\n\n|i    j     k|\n|-4   -5     0|\n|-4    0    -8|\n\n= i*(-5*(-8) - 0*0) - j*(-4*(-8) - 0*(-4)) + k*(-4*0 - (-5)*(-4))\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni: (-5)*(-8) - 0*0 = 40 - 0 = 40\nj: - [ (-4)*(-8) - 0*(-4) ) ] = - [32 - 0] = -32\nk: (-4)*0 - (-5)*(-4) = 0 - 20 = -20\n\nSo, AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)\u00b2 + (-20)\u00b2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024).\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7.\n\nSo sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12\u221a21 = 6\u221a21.\n\nSince all four faces are congruent, the total surface area S = 4 * 6\u221a21 = 24\u221a21.\n\nNow, going back to the inradius formula:\n\nr = 3V / S\n\nWe have V = 160/3, S = 24\u221a21.\n\nSo,\n\nr = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160 / (24\u221a21) = (160 \u00f7 8) / (24 \u00f7 8 * \u221a21) = 20 / (3\u221a21)\n\nSimplify this:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21:\n\nr = (20\u221a21) / (3 * 21) = (20\u221a21) / 63\n\nSimplify 20 and 63: they have a GCD of 1, so the fraction is reduced.\n\nThus, r = (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nSo, m = 20, n = 21, p = 63.\n\nWait, but 63 can be simplified with 20? Let me check. 20 and 63 share no common factors besides 1, so yes, it's reduced.\n\nBut wait, 20 and 63: 20 factors are 2,2,5; 63 is 7,3,3. No common factors, so yes, 20/63 is in simplest terms.\n\nBut n is 21, which is 3*7, so it's square-free, which satisfies the condition.\n\nSo, the distance is 20\u221a21 / 63.\n\nSo, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nFirst, the volume calculation: The vectors AB, AC, AD were correctly computed, then the cross product AC \u00d7 AD was correctly found as (-40, -32, 20). Then AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD) was 320, so volume is 320/6 = 160/3. That seems correct.\n\nThen, for the area, I used vectors AB and AC in triangle ABC. The cross product AB \u00d7 AC was (40, -32, -20), whose magnitude squared is 40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 = 1600 + 1024 + 400 = 3024. sqrt(3024) is indeed 12\u221a21, so area is 6\u221a21. Total surface area 4*6\u221a21 = 24\u221a21. Correct.\n\nThen, inradius r = 3V/S = 3*(160/3)/(24\u221a21) = 160/(24\u221a21) = 20/(3\u221a21) = (20\u221a21)/63. Correct.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer is 20\u221a21 /63, so m + n + p is 20 +21 +63 = 104.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we recognize that the given tetrahedron is a disphenoid with opposite edges equal. We assign coordinates to the vertices to simplify calculations and compute the volume and surface area.\n\n1. **Volume Calculation**:\n   - Using coordinates for vertices \\(A(2, \\frac{5}{2}, 4)\\), \\(B(-2, -\\frac{5}{2}, 4)\\), \\(C(-2, \\frac{5}{2}, -4)\\), and \\(D(2, -\\frac{5}{2}, -4)\\), we compute vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{AB} = (-4, -5, 0) \\), \\( \\overrightarrow{AC} = (-4, 0, -8) \\), and \\( \\overrightarrow{AD} = (0, -5, -8) \\).\n   - The cross product \\( \\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD} = (-40, -32, 20) \\).\n   - The dot product \\( \\overrightarrow{AB} \\cdot (\\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD}) = 320 \\).\n   - The volume \\( V = \\frac{1}{6} |320| = \\frac{160}{3} \\).\n\n2. **Surface Area Calculation**:\n   - The area of one face (triangle \\(ABC\\)) is calculated using the cross product \\( \\overrightarrow{AB} \\times \\overrightarrow{AC} = (40, -32, -20) \\), with magnitude \\( 12\\sqrt{21} \\).\n   - The area of one face is \\( 6\\sqrt{21} \\), and the total surface area \\( S = 4 \\times 6\\sqrt{21} = 24\\sqrt{21} \\).\n\n3. **Inradius Calculation**:\n   - The inradius \\( r = \\frac{3V}{S} = \\frac{3 \\times \\frac{160}{3}}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{160}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63} \\).\n\nThus, the distance is \\( \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63} \\), and the sum \\( m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104 \\).\n\n\\boxed{104}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths. The problem is asking for the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face, and then express it in a certain form and find the sum m + n + p.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found by the formula:\n\nr = 3V / S\n\nWhere V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find both the volume and the surface area.\n\nBut wait, the tetrahedron has edges given in a specific way. Let me note down the given edge lengths:\n\nAB = CD = sqrt(41)\nAC = BD = sqrt(80)\nBC = AD = sqrt(89)\n\nHmm, so opposite edges are equal. That probably means the tetrahedron is \"isohedral\" or something? Or maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. I think such tetrahedrons are called \"equifacial\" or \"isosceles\" tetrahedrons. In any case, maybe there's a way to compute the volume more easily because of this symmetry.\n\nI recall that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it's a kind of symmetrical figure, and perhaps all the faces are congruent triangles. Wait, let me check if that's the case.\n\nEach face is a triangle with sides:\n\nFor face ABC: AB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), BC = sqrt(89)\nSimilarly, for face ABD: AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89)\nSame for the other faces. So yes, all faces are congruent triangles. So each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). That's helpful because all four faces are congruent, so the surface area will be four times the area of one such triangle.\n\nSo, first, let me compute the area of one face. Let's take triangle ABC with sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nTo find the area, I can use Heron's formula. First, compute the semi-perimeter:\n\ns = (a + b + c) / 2\nBut wait, let's compute a^2, b^2, c^2 to see if it's a right triangle or something. Because if it is, then area is easier.\n\na^2 = 41, b^2 = 80, c^2 = 89.\n\nCheck if a^2 + b^2 = c^2: 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11^2, not 89. So that's not a right triangle. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 41 + 89 = 130, which isn't 80. Or 80 + 89 = 169, which is 13^2, but 41 isn't 169. So no, not a right triangle. So Heron's formula it is.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s:\n\ns = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2\n\nBut this looks messy. Maybe I can compute s^2 or something else? Alternatively, maybe I can use another formula for the area, like using vectors or coordinates?\n\nWait, maybe I can find the volume of the tetrahedron first, but to find the volume, I might need coordinates. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume. Since I have all the edge lengths, that might be the way to go.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:\n\nVolume^2 = (1/288) * determinant of the matrix:\n\n0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 a^2 b^2 c^2\n1 a^2 0 d^2 f^2\n1 b^2 d^2 0 e^2\n1 c^2 f^2 e^2 0\n\nWait, but I need to make sure I get the edges right. Let me label the points as A, B, C, D.\n\nGiven AB = sqrt(41), so AB^2 = 41.\n\nAC = sqrt(80), so AC^2 = 80.\n\nAD = sqrt(89), so AD^2 = 89.\n\nBC = sqrt(89), so BC^2 = 89.\n\nBD = sqrt(80), so BD^2 = 80.\n\nCD = sqrt(41), so CD^2 = 41.\n\nSo, the determinant matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 41\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 80\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 41, 80, 0\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant is a 5x5 matrix where the first row is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1], and the first column is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]^T.\n\nThen, the other entries are the squares of the distances between points.\n\nSo, the (i,j) entry for i,j >=1 is the square of the distance between point i-1 and point j-1.\n\nWait, so perhaps the first point is A, then B, C, D. So:\n\nCM[1,1] = 0\n\nCM[1,2] = AB^2 =41\n\nCM[1,3] = AC^2=80\n\nCM[1,4]=AD^2=89\n\nSimilarly,\n\nCM[2,1] = AB^2=41\n\nCM[2,2]=0\n\nCM[2,3]=BC^2=89\n\nCM[2,4]=BD^2=80\n\nCM[3,1]=AC^2=80\n\nCM[3,2]=BC^2=89\n\nCM[3,3]=0\n\nCM[3,4]=CD^2=41\n\nCM[4,1]=AD^2=89\n\nCM[4,2]=BD^2=80\n\nCM[4,3]=CD^2=41\n\nCM[4,4]=0\n\nSo, the matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1:1, 0,41,80,89\n\nRow 2:1,41,0,89,41\n\nRow 3:1,80,89,0,80\n\nRow 4:1,89,41,80,0\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in row 4.\n\nWait, the points are A, B, C, D.\n\nSo, the distance from D to A is AD^2=89, from D to B is BD^2=80, from D to C is CD^2=41.\n\nSo, in row 4 (which corresponds to point D), the entries should be:\n\nCM[4,1] = AD^2=89\n\nCM[4,2] = BD^2=80\n\nCM[4,3] = CD^2=41\n\nCM[4,4]=0\n\nSo yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, now I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix, and then Volume^2 is (1/288) times that determinant.\n\nBut computing a 5x5 determinant by hand is going to be really tedious. Maybe there's some symmetry or pattern I can exploit.\n\nLooking at the matrix:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1:1, 0,41,80,89\n\nRow 2:1,41,0,89,41\n\nRow 3:1,80,89,0,80\n\nRow 4:1,89,41,80,0\n\nI notice that the matrix is symmetric, which might help in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can perform some row or column operations to simplify it.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is better. Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron is \"equifacial\", meaning all faces have the same area, which we already saw. So perhaps this implies that the volume can be computed in a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can assign coordinates to the points to make the computation easier.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me place the tetrahedron in 3D space. Let me set point A at (0, 0, 0). Let me set point B at (x, 0, 0). Then point C can be at (p, q, 0), and point D at (r, s, t).\n\nBut since the opposite edges are equal, perhaps there's a way to choose coordinates such that AB is along the x-axis, and then points C and D are symmetric in some way.\n\nWait, another approach is to use the fact that in such a tetrahedron, the coordinates can be set such that the centroid is at the origin, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider vectors for the edges.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the property that in a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) )) / 12\n\nWait, but that's for a different case. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron in terms of the squares of its edges.\n\nWait, the Cayley-Menger determinant is the way to go, even though it's a bit of work.\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant is:\n\n| 0  1    1    1    1  |\n| 1  0   41   80   89 |\n| 1 41    0   89   41 |\n| 1 80   89    0   80 |\n| 1 89   41   80    0 |\n\nLet me denote this matrix as CM.\n\nI need to compute det(CM). Let me write down the matrix:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1:1, 0,41,80,89\n\nRow 2:1,41,0,89,41\n\nRow 3:1,80,89,0,80\n\nRow 4:1,89,41,80,0\n\nComputing the determinant of a 5x5 matrix is a bit involved, but let's try to expand it step by step.\n\nBut maybe I can perform row operations to simplify the determinant. Since the first row has a 0 followed by ones, perhaps I can subtract rows to create more zeros.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps expand along the first row.\n\nThe determinant can be expanded along the first row. The first element is 0, so that term is zero. Then, the other elements are 1s, each multiplied by their cofactors.\n\nSo, det(CM) = 0*C00 - 1*C01 + 1*C02 - 1*C03 + 1*C04\n\nWhere C0j is the cofactor of element (0,j).\n\nBut computing each cofactor would involve computing 4x4 determinants, which is still a lot, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider using the fact that the tetrahedron is symmetrical, so maybe the determinant can be simplified.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps this tetrahedron is orthocentric or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the volume using another method, like the formula involving the product of the lengths of the edges and the angles between them, but that might not be easier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find vectors for the edges and compute the scalar triple product.\n\nWait, perhaps assigning coordinates would be better.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me place point A at (0, 0, 0).\n\nLet me place point B at (x, 0, 0). So AB is along the x-axis, with length sqrt(41), so x = sqrt(41). So B is at (sqrt(41), 0, 0).\n\nNow, point C is somewhere in the xy-plane. Let me denote its coordinates as (a, b, 0). Then, AC = sqrt(80), so the distance from A(0,0,0) to C(a,b,0) is sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = sqrt(80). So a^2 + b^2 = 80.\n\nSimilarly, BC = sqrt(89). The distance from B(sqrt(41),0,0) to C(a,b,0) is sqrt( (a - sqrt(41))^2 + b^2 ) = sqrt(89). So (a - sqrt(41))^2 + b^2 = 89.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1) a^2 + b^2 = 80\n\n2) (a - sqrt(41))^2 + b^2 = 89\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(a - sqrt(41))^2 - a^2 = 89 - 80\n\nExpanding (a - sqrt(41))^2: a^2 - 2a sqrt(41) + 41\n\nSo, a^2 - 2a sqrt(41) + 41 - a^2 = 9\n\nSimplify: -2a sqrt(41) + 41 = 9\n\nSo, -2a sqrt(41) = 9 - 41 = -32\n\nDivide both sides by -2 sqrt(41):\n\na = (-32)/(-2 sqrt(41)) = 16 / sqrt(41) = (16 sqrt(41)) / 41\n\nSo, a = (16 sqrt(41)) / 41\n\nNow, substitute back into equation 1 to find b.\n\na^2 + b^2 = 80\n\nCompute a^2:\n\n(16 sqrt(41)/41)^2 = (256 * 41) / (41^2) )= 256 / 41\n\nSo, 256/41 + b^2 = 80\n\nSo, b^2 = 80 - 256/41 = (80*41 - 256)/41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024 /41\n\nSo, b = sqrt(3024 /41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 *7\n\nSo sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, b = 12 sqrt(21) / sqrt(41) = (12 sqrt(21 * 41)) / 41 = (12 sqrt(861))/41\n\nWait, is 21 and 41 both square-free? Yes, because 21=3*7, 41 is prime.\n\nSo, b = (12 sqrt(861))/41\n\nSo, point C is at (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41, 0)\n\nNow, let's find the coordinates of point D. Since AD = sqrt(89), BD = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41).\n\nLet me denote point D as (p, q, r). Since the tetrahedron is in 3D space, z-coordinate r is non-zero.\n\nWe have:\n\nAD^2 = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 89\n\nBD^2 = (p - sqrt(41))^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 80\n\nCD^2 = (p - 16 sqrt(41)/41)^2 + (q - 12 sqrt(861)/41)^2 + r^2 = 41\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\n1) p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 89\n\n2) (p - sqrt(41))^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 80\n\n3) (p - 16 sqrt(41)/41)^2 + (q - 12 sqrt(861)/41)^2 + r^2 = 41\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(p - sqrt(41))^2 - p^2 = 80 -89 = -9\n\nExpand (p - sqrt(41))^2: p^2 - 2p sqrt(41) +41\n\nSo, p^2 - 2p sqrt(41) +41 - p^2 = -9\n\nSimplify: -2p sqrt(41) +41 = -9\n\nSo, -2p sqrt(41) = -50\n\nDivide both sides by -2 sqrt(41):\n\np = (-50)/(-2 sqrt(41)) = 25 / sqrt(41) = (25 sqrt(41))/41\n\nSo, p = (25 sqrt(41))/41\n\nNow, substitute p into equation 1:\n\np^2 + q^2 + r^2 =89\n\nCompute p^2:\n\n(25 sqrt(41)/41)^2 = (625 *41)/(41^2) )= 625/41\n\nSo, 625/41 + q^2 + r^2 =89\n\nThus, q^2 + r^2 =89 -625/41 = (89*41 -625)/41 = (3649 -625)/41 = 3024/41\n\nSo, q^2 + r^2 =3024/41\n\nNow, let's look at equation 3:\n\n(p - 16 sqrt(41)/41)^2 + (q - 12 sqrt(861)/41)^2 + r^2 =41\n\nCompute (p -16 sqrt(41)/41):\n\np =25 sqrt(41)/41, so p -16 sqrt(41)/41 = (25 sqrt(41) -16 sqrt(41))/41 =9 sqrt(41)/41\n\nSo, (9 sqrt(41)/41)^2 = (81 *41)/(41^2) )=81/41\n\nSimilarly, (q -12 sqrt(861)/41)^2 = q^2 - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q + (144 *861)/(41^2)\n\nSo, equation 3 becomes:\n\n81/41 + q^2 - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q + (144 *861)/(41^2) + r^2 =41\n\nBut we know from earlier that q^2 + r^2 =3024/41. So, substitute that in:\n\n81/41 + (3024/41) - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q + (144*861)/(41^2) =41\n\nCompute the constants:\n\n81/41 +3024/41 = (81 +3024)/41 =3105/41\n\nAnd 144*861 = let's compute that:\n\n144 *800 = 115200\n\n144 *61 = 8784\n\nSo total is 115200 +8784 =123,984\n\nSo, (144*861)/(41^2) =123984/(41^2) =123984/1681\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n3105/41 - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q +123984/1681 =41\n\nConvert 41 to 41*1681/1681 = 68921/1681\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(3105/41) + (123984/1681) - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q =68921/1681\n\nMultiply all terms by 1681 to eliminate denominators:\n\n3105 *41 +123984 -24 sqrt(861) *41 q =68921\n\nCompute 3105 *41:\n\n3105 *40 =124,200\n\n3105 *1=3,105\n\nTotal: 124,200 +3,105=127,305\n\nSo, 127,305 +123,984 -24*41 sqrt(861) q =68,921\n\nCompute 127,305 +123,984=251,289\n\nSo, 251,289 - 984 sqrt(861) q =68,921\n\nSubtract 68,921:\n\n251,289 -68,921=182,368\n\nSo, 182,368 -984 sqrt(861) q=0\n\nThus, 984 sqrt(861) q=182,368\n\nSo, q=182,368/(984 sqrt(861))\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nFirst, factor numerator and denominator:\n\n182368 \u00f7 8=22796\n\n984 \u00f78=123\n\nSo, 22796 /123 sqrt(861)\n\nSimplify 22796 \u00f7123:\n\n123 *185=123*(180+5)=123*180=22,140; 123*5=615 \u2192 total 22,140 +615=22,755\n\n22796 -22755=41\n\nSo, 22796=123*185 +41\n\nSo, 22796/123=185 +41/123=185 +41/123=185 + 41/123=185 + (41/123)=185 + (1/3) approximately.\n\nWait, but 41 and 123 share a common factor of 41.\n\n41/123=1/3\n\nSo, 22796/123=185 +1/3=185.333...\n\nSo, q= (185 +1/3)/sqrt(861)= (556/3)/sqrt(861)=556/(3 sqrt(861))\n\nBut let me write it as:\n\nq=556/(3 sqrt(861))\n\nBut we can rationalize the denominator:\n\nq=556 sqrt(861)/(3*861)=556 sqrt(861)/(2583)\n\nBut 556 and 2583: Let's see if they have a common factor.\n\n556 \u00f74=139, which is prime. 2583 \u00f7139= 2583 /139= let's see 139*18=2502, 2583-2502=81. 81/139 is not integer. So, 556 and 2583 share a common factor of 4? Wait, 556 is 4*139, and 2583 \u00f7139 is 18.59\u2026 which is not integer. So, no, the fraction is 556/2583.\n\nWait, maybe 556 and 2583 have a common factor. Let's check.\n\n2583 \u00f7556= approx 4.647. 556*4=2224, 2583-2224=359.\n\nCheck GCD(556,359):\n\n556 \u00f7359=1 with remainder 197\n\n359 \u00f7197=1 with remainder 162\n\n197 \u00f7162=1 with remainder 35\n\n162 \u00f735=4 with remainder 22\n\n35 \u00f722=1 with remainder 13\n\n22 \u00f713=1 with remainder 9\n\n13 \u00f79=1 with remainder 4\n\n9 \u00f74=2 with remainder 1\n\n4 \u00f71=4 with remainder 0\n\nSo GCD is 1. Therefore, 556 and 2583 are coprime. So, q=556 sqrt(861)/(3*861)=556 sqrt(861)/2583\n\nWait, but 556 is 4*139, and 2583= let me factor 2583:\n\n2583 \u00f73=861.\n\n861 \u00f73=287.\n\n287 \u00f77=41.\n\nSo, 2583=3*3*7*41=9*7*41.\n\nSo, 2583=9*7*41.\n\n556=4*139.\n\nSo, no common factors, so q=556 sqrt(861)/2583\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nWe had equation 3 after substituting p and q^2 + r^2:\n\n81/41 + (3024/41) - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q +123984/1681 =41\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated 123984/1681.\n\nWait, 123984 \u00f71681: let's compute 1681*70=117,670; 1681*74=1681*(70+4)=117,670+6,724=124,394.\n\nWait, 1681*74=124,394, which is larger than 123,984. So, 1681*74=124,394, so 123,984 is 124,394 -410=1681*74 -410.\n\nSo, 123,984=1681*74 -410.\n\nSo, 123,984/1681=74 -410/1681.\n\nBut 410=2*5*41.\n\n1681=41^2.\n\nSo, 410/1681= (2*5*41)/41^2=10/41.\n\nSo, 123984/1681=74 -10/41=73 + (1 -10/41)=73 +31/41=73.756...\n\nWait, but maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute 123,984 \u00f71681:\n\nCompute 1681 * 74 = 124,394\n\n124,394 -123,984=410\n\nSo, 123,984=1681*(74) -410\n\nSo, 123,984 /1681=74 -410/1681=74 - (410/1681)\n\nBut 410=10*41, so 410/1681=10/41.\n\nSo, 123984/1681=74 -10/41= (74*41 -10)/41= (3034 -10)/41=3024/41\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, 123984/1681=3024/41\n\nSo, equation 3 becomes:\n\n81/41 +3024/41 - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q +3024/41=41\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, because I had:\n\nequation 3: 81/41 + (q^2 + r^2) - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q +123984/1681 =41\n\nBut we know that q^2 + r^2=3024/41, so substituting:\n\n81/41 +3024/41 - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q +123984/1681=41\n\nBut 123984/1681=3024/41, as we just saw.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n81/41 +3024/41 +3024/41 - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q=41\n\nWait, that's:\n\n(81 +3024 +3024)/41 - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q=41\n\nCompute numerator:81 +3024=3105; 3105 +3024=6129\n\nSo, 6129/41 - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q=41\n\nConvert 41 to 41*41/41=1681/41\n\nSo:\n\n6129/41 -1681/41= (6129-1681)/41=4448/41\n\nSo, 4448/41 - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q=0\n\nThus,\n\n(24 sqrt(861)/41) q=4448/41\n\nMultiply both sides by 41:\n\n24 sqrt(861) q=4448\n\nSo,\n\nq=4448/(24 sqrt(861))=4448/(24 sqrt(861))\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n4448 \u00f78=556, 24 \u00f78=3.\n\nSo, q=556/(3 sqrt(861))\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, q=556/(3 sqrt(861))\n\nAgain, rationalize the denominator:\n\nq=556 sqrt(861)/(3*861)=556 sqrt(861)/2583\n\nNow, compute q^2 + r^2=3024/41\n\nWe can compute q^2:\n\n(556)^2= (500+56)^2=500^2 +2*500*56 +56^2=250000 +56000 +3136=309,136\n\nSo, q^2= (556)^2/(3^2 *861^2)=309136/(9 *740,881)=309136/6,667,929\n\nWait, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can express r^2=3024/41 - q^2.\n\nBut maybe it's not necessary.

Let me compute the area.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s=(sqrt(41)+sqrt(80)+sqrt(89))/2\n\nBut that's messy, but perhaps I can compute it using vectors.\n\nAlternatively, since all faces are congruent, and the tetrahedron is symmetrical, perhaps the surface area is 4 times the area of one face.\n\nBut let's compute the area of one face.\n\nAlternatively, since I have the coordinates of points A, B, C, I can compute the area of triangle ABC using the cross product.\n\nVectors AB and AC.\n\nAB vector is (sqrt(41),0,0)\n\nAC vector is (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41,0)\n\nCross product AB \u00d7 AC is:\n\n|i     j          k|\n|sqrt41 0          0|\n|16s41/41 12s861/41 0|\n\nWhich is i*(0*0 -0*12s861/41) - j*(sqrt41*0 -0*(16s41/41)) + k*(sqrt41*(12s861/41) -0*(16s41/41))\n\nSo, cross product is (0,0, (sqrt(41)*12 sqrt(861))/41 )\n\nThe magnitude is |(0,0, (12 sqrt(41*861))/41)|\n\nAgain, 41*861=35,301=3*7*41^2, so sqrt(35,301)=41 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, magnitude=12*41 sqrt(21)/41=12 sqrt(21)\n\nThus, area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21)=6 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, each face has area 6 sqrt(21). So, total surface area S=4*6 sqrt(21)=24 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, S=24 sqrt(21)\n\nNow, inradius r= 3V / S= 3*(160/3)/(24 sqrt(21))= (160)/(24 sqrt(21))= (20)/(3 sqrt(21))= (20 sqrt(21))/(3*21)=20 sqrt(21)/63\n\nSimplify 20 and 63: GCD is 1, so it's 20 sqrt(21)/63\n\nSo, the distance is 20 sqrt(21)/63, which can be written as (20 sqrt(21))/63\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nCheck if m and p are coprime: 20 and 63 share no common factors besides 1. 21 is square-free.\n\nSo, m +n +p=20 +21 +63=104\n",

Using the cross product of vectors, we find the area of one face:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one face} = 6\\sqrt{21}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total surface area \\( S \\) is:\n\n\\[\nS = 4 \\times 6\\sqrt{21} = 24\\sqrt{21}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Inradius\nThe inradius \\( r \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{3V}{S} = \\frac{3 \\times \\frac{160}{3}}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{160}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Express in the Form \\( \\frac{m\\sqrt{n}}{p} \\)\nThe inradius is expressed as \\( \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63} \\), where \\( m = 20 \\), \\( n = 21 \\), and \\( p = 63 \\). These values satisfy the conditions that \\( m \\) and \\( p \\) are coprime, and \\( n \\) is square-free.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\nm + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\n\\]\n\n\\boxed{104}",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths. The problem is asking for the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face, and then express it in a certain form and find the sum m + n + p.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found by the formula:\n\nr = 3V / S\n\nWhere V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find both the volume and the surface area.\n\nBut wait, the tetrahedron has edges given in a specific way. Let me note down the given edge lengths:\n\nAB = CD = sqrt(41)\nAC = BD = sqrt(80)\nBC = AD = sqrt(89)\n\nHmm, so opposite edges are equal. That probably means the tetrahedron is \"isohedral\" or something? Or maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. I think such tetrahedrons are called \"equifacial\" or \"isosceles\" tetrahedrons. In any case, maybe there's a way to compute the volume more easily because of this symmetry.\n\nI recall that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it's a kind of symmetrical figure, and perhaps all the faces are congruent triangles. Wait, let me check if that's the case.\n\nEach face is a triangle with sides:\n\nFor face ABC: AB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), BC = sqrt(89)\nSimilarly, for face ABD: AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89)\nSame for the other faces. So yes, all faces are congruent triangles. So each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). That's helpful because all four faces are congruent, so the surface area will be four times the area of one such triangle.\n\nSo, first, let me compute the area of one face. Let's take triangle ABC with sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nTo find the area, I can use Heron's formula. First, compute the semi-perimeter:\n\ns = (a + b + c) / 2\nBut wait, let's compute a^2, b^2, c^2 to see if it's a right triangle or something. Because if it is, then area is easier.\n\na^2 = 41, b^2 = 80, c^2 = 89.\n\nCheck if a^2 + b^2 = c^2: 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11^2, not 89. So that's not a right triangle. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 41 + 89 = 130, which isn't 80. Or 80 + 89 = 169, which is 13^2, but 41 isn't 169. So no, not a right triangle. So Heron's formula it is.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s:\n\ns = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2\n\nBut this looks messy. Maybe I can compute s^2 or something else? Alternatively, maybe I can use another formula for the area, like using vectors or coordinates?\n\nWait, maybe I can find the volume of the tetrahedron first, but to find the volume, I might need coordinates. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume. Since I have all the edge lengths, that might be the way to go.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:\n\nVolume^2 = (1/288) * determinant of the matrix:\n\n0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 a^2 b^2 c^2\n1 a^2 0 d^2 f^2\n1 b^2 d^2 0 e^2\n1 c^2 f^2 e^2 0\n\nWait, but I need to make sure I get the edges right. Let me label the points as A, B, C, D.\n\nGiven AB = sqrt(41), so AB^2 = 41.\n\nAC = sqrt(80), so AC^2 = 80.\n\nAD = sqrt(89), so AD^2 = 89.\n\nBC = sqrt(89), so BC^2 = 89.\n\nBD = sqrt(80), so BD^2 = 80.\n\nCD = sqrt(41), so CD^2 = 41.\n\nSo, the determinant matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 41\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 80\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 41, 80, 0\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant is a 5x5 matrix where the first row is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1], and the first column is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]^T.\n\nThen, the other entries are the squares of the distances between points.\n\nSo, the (i,j) entry for i,j >=1 is the square of the distance between point i-1 and point j-1.\n\nWait, so perhaps the first point is A, then B, C, D. So:\n\nCM[1,1] = 0\n\nCM[1,2] = AB^2 =41\n\nCM[1,3] = AC^2=80\n\nCM[1,4]=AD^2=89\n\nSimilarly,\n\nCM[2,1] = AB^2=41\n\nCM[2,2]=0\n\nCM[2,3]=BC^2=89\n\nCM[2,4]=BD^2=80\n\nCM[3,1]=AC^2=80\n\nCM[3,2]=BC^2=89\n\nCM[3,3]=0\n\nCM[3,4]=CD^2=41\n\nCM[4,1]=AD^2=89\n\nCM[4,2]=BD^2=80\n\nCM[4,3]=CD^2=41\n\nCM[4,4]=0\n\nSo, the matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1:1, 0,41,80,89\n\nRow 2:1,41,0,89,41\n\nRow 3:1,80,89,0,80\n\nRow 4:1,89,41,80,0\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in row 4.\n\nWait, the points are A, B, C, D.\n\nSo, the distance from D to A is AD^2=89, from D to B is BD^2=80, from D to C is CD^2=41.\n\nSo, in row 4 (which corresponds to point D), the entries should be:\n\nCM[4,1] = AD^2=89\n\nCM[4,2] = BD^2=80\n\nCM[4,3] = CD^2=41\n\nCM[4,4]=0\n\nSo yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, now I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix, and then Volume^2 is (1/288) times that determinant.\n\nBut computing a 5x5 determinant by hand is going to be really tedious. Maybe there's some symmetry or pattern I can exploit.\n\nLooking at the matrix:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1:1, 0,41,80,89\n\nRow 2:1,41,0,89,41\n\nRow 3:1,80,89,0,80\n\nRow 4:1,89,41,80,0\n\nI notice that the matrix is symmetric, which might help in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can perform some row or column operations to simplify it.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is better. Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron is \"equifacial\", meaning all faces have the same area, which we already saw. So perhaps this implies that the volume can be computed in a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can assign coordinates to the points to make the computation easier.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me place the tetrahedron in 3D space. Let me set point A at (0, 0, 0). Let me set point B at (x, 0, 0). Then point C can be at (p, q, 0), and point D at (r, s, t).\n\nBut since the opposite edges are equal, perhaps there's a way to choose coordinates such that AB is along the x-axis, and then points C and D are symmetric in some way.\n\nWait, another approach is to use the fact that in such a tetrahedron, the coordinates can be set such that the centroid is at the origin, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider vectors for the edges.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the property that in a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, the volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) )) / 12\n\nWait, but that's for a different case. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron in terms of the squares of its edges.\n\nWait, the Cayley-Menger determinant is the way to go, even though it's a bit of work.\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant is:\n\n| 0  1    1    1    1  |\n| 1  0   41   80   89 |\n| 1 41    0   89   41 |\n| 1 80   89    0   80 |\n| 1 89   41   80    0 |\n\nLet me denote this matrix as CM.\n\nI need to compute det(CM). Let me write down the matrix:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1:1, 0,41,80,89\n\nRow 2:1,41,0,89,41\n\nRow 3:1,80,89,0,80\n\nRow 4:1,89,41,80,0\n\nComputing the determinant of a 5x5 matrix is a bit involved, but let's try to expand it step by step.\n\nBut maybe I can perform row operations to simplify the determinant. Since the first row has a 0 followed by ones, perhaps I can subtract rows to create more zeros.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps expand along the first row.\n\nThe determinant can be expanded along the first row. The first element is 0, so that term is zero. Then, the other elements are 1s, each multiplied by their cofactors.\n\nSo, det(CM) = 0*C00 - 1*C01 + 1*C02 - 1*C03 + 1*C04\n\nWhere C0j is the cofactor of element (0,j).\n\nBut computing each cofactor would involve computing 4x4 determinants, which is still a lot, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider using the fact that the tetrahedron is symmetrical, so maybe the determinant can be simplified.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps this tetrahedron is orthocentric or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the volume using another method, like the formula involving the product of the lengths of the edges and the angles between them, but that might not be easier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find vectors for the edges and compute the scalar triple product.\n\nWait, perhaps assigning coordinates would be better.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me place point A at (0, 0, 0).\n\nLet me place point B at (x, 0, 0). So AB is along the x-axis, with length sqrt(41), so x = sqrt(41). So B is at (sqrt(41), 0, 0).\n\nNow, point C is somewhere in the xy-plane. Let me denote its coordinates as (a, b, 0). Then, AC = sqrt(80), so the distance from A(0,0,0) to C(a,b,0) is sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = sqrt(80). So a^2 + b^2 = 80.\n\nSimilarly, BC = sqrt(89). The distance from B(sqrt(41),0,0) to C(a,b,0) is sqrt( (a - sqrt(41))^2 + b^2 ) = sqrt(89). So (a - sqrt(41))^2 + b^2 = 89.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1) a^2 + b^2 = 80\n\n2) (a - sqrt(41))^2 + b^2 = 89\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(a - sqrt(41))^2 - a^2 = 89 - 80\n\nExpanding (a - sqrt(41))^2: a^2 - 2a sqrt(41) + 41\n\nSo, a^2 - 2a sqrt(41) + 41 - a^2 = 9\n\nSimplify: -2a sqrt(41) + 41 = 9\n\nSo, -2a sqrt(41) = 9 - 41 = -32\n\nDivide both sides by -2 sqrt(41):\n\na = (-32)/(-2 sqrt(41)) = 16 / sqrt(41) = (16 sqrt(41)) / 41\n\nSo, a = (16 sqrt(41)) / 41\n\nNow, substitute back into equation 1 to find b.\n\na^2 + b^2 = 80\n\nCompute a^2:\n\n(16 sqrt(41)/41)^2 = (256 * 41) / (41^2) )= 256 / 41\n\nSo, 256/41 + b^2 = 80\n\nSo, b^2 = 80 - 256/41 = (80*41 - 256)/41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024 /41\n\nSo, b = sqrt(3024 /41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 *7\n\nSo sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, b = 12 sqrt(21) / sqrt(41) = (12 sqrt(21 * 41)) / 41 = (12 sqrt(861))/41\n\nWait, is 21 and 41 both square-free? Yes, because 21=3*7, 41 is prime.\n\nSo, b = (12 sqrt(861))/41\n\nSo, point C is at (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41, 0)\n\nNow, let's find the coordinates of point D. Since AD = sqrt(89), BD = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41).\n\nLet me denote point D as (p, q, r). Since the tetrahedron is in 3D space, z-coordinate r is non-zero.\n\nWe have:\n\nAD^2 = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 89\n\nBD^2 = (p - sqrt(41))^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 80\n\nCD^2 = (p - 16 sqrt(41)/41)^2 + (q - 12 sqrt(861)/41)^2 + r^2 = 41\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\n1) p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 89\n\n2) (p - sqrt(41))^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 80\n\n3) (p - 16 sqrt(41)/41)^2 + (q - 12 sqrt(861)/41)^2 + r^2 = 41\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(p - sqrt(41))^2 - p^2 = 80 -89 = -9\n\nExpand (p - sqrt(41))^2: p^2 - 2p sqrt(41) +41\n\nSo, p^2 - 2p sqrt(41) +41 - p^2 = -9\n\nSimplify: -2p sqrt(41) +41 = -9\n\nSo, -2p sqrt(41) = -50\n\nDivide both sides by -2 sqrt(41):\n\np = (-50)/(-2 sqrt(41)) = 25 / sqrt(41) = (25 sqrt(41))/41\n\nSo, p = (25 sqrt(41))/41\n\nNow, substitute p into equation 1:\n\np^2 + q^2 + r^2 =89\n\nCompute p^2:\n\n(25 sqrt(41)/41)^2 = (625 *41)/(41^2) )= 625/41\n\nSo, 625/41 + q^2 + r^2 =89\n\nThus, q^2 + r^2 =89 -625/41 = (89*41 -625)/41 = (3649 -625)/41 = 3024/41\n\nSo, q^2 + r^2 =3024/41\n\nNow, let's look at equation 3:\n\n(p - 16 sqrt(41)/41)^2 + (q - 12 sqrt(861)/41)^2 + r^2 =41\n\nCompute (p -16 sqrt(41)/41):\n\np =25 sqrt(41)/41, so p -16 sqrt(41)/41 = (25 sqrt(41) -16 sqrt(41))/41 =9 sqrt(41)/41\n\nSo, (9 sqrt(41)/41)^2 = (81 *41)/(41^2) )=81/41\n\nSimilarly, (q -12 sqrt(861)/41)^2 = q^2 - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q + (144 *861)/(41^2)\n\nSo, equation 3 becomes:\n\n81/41 + q^2 - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q + (144 *861)/(41^2) + r^2 =41\n\nBut we know from earlier that q^2 + r^2 =3024/41. So, substitute that in:\n\n81/41 + (3024/41) - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q + (144*861)/(41^2) =41\n\nCompute the constants:\n\n81/41 +3024/41 = (81 +3024)/41 =3105/41\n\nAnd 144*861 = let's compute that:\n\n144 *800 = 115200\n\n144 *61 = 8784\n\nSo total is 115200 +8784 =123,984\n\nSo, (144*861)/(41^2) =123984/(41^2) =123984/1681\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n3105/41 - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q +123984/1681 =41\n\nConvert 41 to 41*1681/1681 = 68921/1681\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(3105/41) + (123984/1681) - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q =68921/1681\n\nMultiply all terms by 1681 to eliminate denominators:\n\n3105 *41 +123984 -24 sqrt(861) *41 q =68921\n\nCompute 3105 *41:\n\n3105 *40 =124,200\n\n3105 *1=3,105\n\nTotal: 124,200 +3,105=127,305\n\nSo, 127,305 +123,984 -24*41 sqrt(861) q =68,921\n\nCompute 127,305 +123,984=251,289\n\nSo, 251,289 - 984 sqrt(861) q =68,921\n\nSubtract 68,921:\n\n251,289 -68,921=182,368\n\nSo, 182,368 -984 sqrt(861) q=0\n\nThus, 984 sqrt(861) q=182,368\n\nSo, q=182,368/(984 sqrt(861))\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nFirst, factor numerator and denominator:\n\n182368 \u00f7 8=22796\n\n984 \u00f78=123\n\nSo, 22796 /123 sqrt(861)\n\nSimplify 22796 \u00f7123:\n\n123 *185=123*(180+5)=123*180=22,140; 123*5=615 \u2192 total 22,140 +615=22,755\n\n22796 -22755=41\n\nSo, 22796=123*185 +41\n\nSo, 22796/123=185 +41/123=185 +41/123=185 + 41/123=185 + (41/123)=185 + (1/3) approximately.\n\nWait, but 41 and 123 share a common factor of 41.\n\n41/123=1/3\n\nSo, 22796/123=185 +1/3=185.333...\n\nSo, q= (185 +1/3)/sqrt(861)= (556/3)/sqrt(861)=556/(3 sqrt(861))\n\nBut let me write it as:\n\nq=556/(3 sqrt(861))\n\nBut we can rationalize the denominator:\n\nq=556 sqrt(861)/(3*861)=556 sqrt(861)/(2583)\n\nBut 556 and 2583: Let's see if they have a common factor.\n\n556 \u00f74=139, which is prime. 2583 \u00f7139= 2583 /139= let's see 139*18=2502, 2583-2502=81. 81/139 is not integer. So, 556 and 2583 share a common factor of 4? Wait, 556 is 4*139, and 2583 \u00f7139 is 18.59\u2026 which is not integer. So, no, the fraction is 556/2583.\n\nWait, maybe 556 and 2583 have a common factor. Let's check.\n\n2583 \u00f7556= approx 4.647. 556*4=2224, 2583-2224=359.\n\nCheck GCD(556,359):\n\n556 \u00f7359=1 with remainder 197\n\n359 \u00f7197=1 with remainder 162\n\n197 \u00f7162=1 with remainder 35\n\n162 \u00f735=4 with remainder 22\n\n35 \u00f722=1 with remainder 13\n\n22 \u00f713=1 with remainder 9\n\n13 \u00f79=1 with remainder 4\n\n9 \u00f74=2 with remainder 1\n\n4 \u00f71=4 with remainder 0\n\nSo GCD is 1. Therefore, 556 and 2583 are coprime. So, q=556 sqrt(861)/(3*861)=556 sqrt(861)/2583\n\nWait, but 556 is 4*139, and 2583= let me factor 2583:\n\n2583 \u00f73=861.\n\n861 \u00f73=287.\n\n287 \u00f77=41.\n\nSo, 2583=3*3*7*41=9*7*41.\n\nSo, 2583=9*7*41.\n\n556=4*139.\n\nSo, no common factors, so q=556 sqrt(861)/2583\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nWe had equation 3 after substituting p and q^2 + r^2:\n\n81/41 + (3024/41) - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q +123984/1681 =41\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated 123984/1681.\n\nWait, 123984 \u00f71681: let's compute 1681*70=117,670; 1681*74=1681*(70+4)=117,670+6,724=124,394.\n\nWait, 1681*74=124,394, which is larger than 123,984. So, 1681*74=124,394, so 123,984 is 124,394 -410=1681*74 -410.\n\nSo, 123,984=1681*74 -410.\n\nSo, 123,984/1681=74 -410/1681.\n\nBut 410=2*5*41.\n\n1681=41^2.\n\nSo, 410/1681= (2*5*41)/41^2=10/41.\n\nSo, 123984/1681=74 -10/41=73 + (1 -10/41)=73 +31/41=73.756...\n\nWait, but maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute 123,984 \u00f71681:\n\nCompute 1681 * 74 = 124,394\n\n124,394 -123,984=410\n\nSo, 123,984=1681*(74) -410\n\nSo, 123,984 /1681=74 -410/1681=74 - (410/1681)\n\nBut 410=10*41, so 410/1681=10/41.\n\nSo, 123984/1681=74 -10/41= (74*41 -10)/41= (3034 -10)/41=3024/41\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, 123984/1681=3024/41\n\nSo, equation 3 becomes:\n\n81/41 +3024/41 - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q +3024/41=41\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, because I had:\n\nequation 3: 81/41 + (q^2 + r^2) - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q +123984/1681 =41\n\nBut we know that q^2 + r^2=3024/41, so substituting:\n\n81/41 +3024/41 - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q +123984/1681=41\n\nBut 123984/1681=3024/41, as we just saw.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n81/41 +3024/41 +3024/41 - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q=41\n\nWait, that's:\n\n(81 +3024 +3024)/41 - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q=41\n\nCompute numerator:81 +3024=3105; 3105 +3024=6129\n\nSo, 6129/41 - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q=41\n\nConvert 41 to 41*41/41=1681/41\n\nSo:\n\n6129/41 -1681/41= (6129-1681)/41=4448/41\n\nSo, 4448/41 - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q=0\n\nThus,\n\n(24 sqrt(861)/41) q=4448/41\n\nMultiply both sides by 41:\n\n24 sqrt(861) q=4448\n\nSo,\n\nq=4448/(24 sqrt(861))=4448/(24 sqrt(861))\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n4448 \u00f78=556, 24 \u00f78=3.\n\nSo, q=556/(3 sqrt(861))\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, q=556/(3 sqrt(861))\n\nAgain, rationalize the denominator:\n\nq=556 sqrt(861)/(3*861)=556 sqrt(861)/2583\n\nNow, compute q^2 + r^2=3024/41\n\nWe can compute q^2:\n\n(556)^2= (500+56)^2=500^2 +2*500*56 +56^2=250000 +56000 +3136=309,136\n\nSo, q^2= (556)^2/(3^2 *861^2)=309136/(9 *740,881)=309136/6,667,929\n\nWait, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can express r^2=3024/41 - q^2.\n\nBut maybe it's not necessary. Since we have all the coordinates, perhaps we can compute the volume using the scalar triple product.\n\nThe volume V of tetrahedron ABCD is (1/6) | scalar triple product of AB, AC, AD |.\n\nWait, but in this coordinate system, points are:\n\nA: (0,0,0)\n\nB: (sqrt(41),0,0)\n\nC: (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41,0)\n\nD: (25 sqrt(41)/41, 556 sqrt(861)/2583, r)\n\nWait, but we can compute vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nWait, vectors from A:\n\nAB vector is B - A = (sqrt(41), 0,0)\n\nAC vector is C - A = (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41, 0)\n\nAD vector is D - A = (25 sqrt(41)/41, 556 sqrt(861)/2583, r)\n\nThe scalar triple product is AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD)\n\nCompute AC \u00d7 AD first.\n\nLet me denote AC = (a, b, 0), AD = (c, d, e). Then AC \u00d7 AD = (b*e - 0*d, 0*c - a*e, a*d - b*c)\n\nSo, AC = (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41, 0)\n\nAD = (25 sqrt(41)/41, 556 sqrt(861)/2583, r)\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 AD is:\n\n( (12 sqrt(861)/41)*r - 0*(556 sqrt(861)/2583), \n0*(25 sqrt(41)/41) - (16 sqrt(41)/41)*r,\n(16 sqrt(41)/41)*(556 sqrt(861)/2583) - (12 sqrt(861)/41)*(25 sqrt(41)/41) )\n\nCompute each component:\n\nFirst component: (12 sqrt(861)/41)*r\n\nSecond component: - (16 sqrt(41)/41)*r\n\nThird component: Let's compute:\n\n(16 sqrt(41)/41)*(556 sqrt(861)/2583) - (12 sqrt(861)/41)*(25 sqrt(41)/41)\n\nFactor out sqrt(41)*sqrt(861)/(41^2):\n\n= [16*556/(41*2583) - 12*25/(41^2)] * sqrt(41*861)/41\n\nWait, let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 16*556 / (41 *2583)\n\nSecond term: 12*25 / (41^2)\n\nCompute 16*556: 16*500=8000, 16*56=896 \u2192 total 8896\n\nCompute 41*2583: 2583=41*63 (since 41*60=2460, 41*3=123 \u2192 2460+123=2583). So 41*2583=41^2 *63=1681*63= let's compute 1681*60=100,860; 1681*3=5,043 \u2192 total 105,903.\n\nSo, first term:8896 /105,903\n\nSecond term: 12*25=300; denominator is 41^2=1681.\n\nSo, second term:300/1681\n\nSo, third component:\n\n[8896 /105903 - 300 /1681] * sqrt(41*861)/41\n\nCompute the terms:\n\nConvert 8896 /105903 and 300 /1681 to have a common denominator.\n\nBut 105903=41*2583=41* (41*63)=41^2*63=1681*63.\n\nSo, 105903=1681*63.\n\nSo, 8896 / (1681*63) = 8896 /105,903\n\n300 /1681= (300*63)/105,903=18,900 /105,903\n\nSo, 8896 -18,900= -10,004\n\nThus, third component:\n\n(-10,004 /105,903) * sqrt(41*861)/41\n\nSimplify sqrt(41*861):\n\n41*861=41*(800+61)=41*800=32,800; 41*61=2,501 \u2192 total 35,301.\n\nSo sqrt(35,301). Let me check if 35,301 is a square.\n\nsqrt(35,301)\u2248187.9, since 187^2=34,969 and 188^2=35,344. So, it's between 187 and 188, not a perfect square. So, it remains sqrt(35301).\n\nBut 35301 factors: Let's see, 35301 \u00f73=11,767. 11,767 \u00f77=1,681. 1,681=41^2.\n\nSo, 35301=3*7*41^2.\n\nSo sqrt(35301)=41*sqrt(21).\n\nBecause 3*7=21.\n\nSo, sqrt(41*861)=sqrt(35301)=41 sqrt(21)\n\nTherefore, third component:\n\n(-10,004 /105,903) * (41 sqrt(21))/41= (-10,004 /105,903) * sqrt(21)\n\nSimplify 10,004 and 105,903.\n\n10,004 \u00f74=2,501; 105,903 \u00f74 is not integer.\n\nCheck GCD(10004,105903). 105,903 \u00f710,004=10 with remainder 5,903 - 10*1,000= 5,903 -10,004*10= wait, 10,004*10=100,040. 105,903-100,040=5,863.\n\nThen, GCD(10,004,5,863). 10,004 \u00f75,863=1 with remainder 4,141.\n\nGCD(5,863,4,141). 5,863 \u00f74,141=1 with remainder 1,722.\n\nGCD(4,141,1,722). 4,141 \u00f71,722=2 with remainder 697.\n\nGCD(1,722,697). 1,722 \u00f7697=2 with remainder 328.\n\nGCD(697,328). 697 \u00f7328=2 with remainder 41.\n\nGCD(328,41). 328 \u00f741=8 with remainder 0.

Let me compute the area.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter s=(sqrt(41)+sqrt(80)+sqrt(89))/2\n\nBut that's messy, but perhaps I can compute it using vectors.\n\nAlternatively, since all faces are congruent, and the tetrahedron is symmetrical, perhaps the surface area is 4 times the area of one face.\n\nBut let's compute the area of one face.\n\nAlternatively, since I have the coordinates of points A, B, C, I can compute the area of triangle ABC using the cross product.\n\nVectors AB and AC.\n\nAB vector is (sqrt(41),0,0)\n\nAC vector is (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41,0)\n\nCross product AB \u00d7 AC is:\n\n|i     j          k|\n|sqrt41 0          0|\n|16s41/41 12s861/41 0|\n\nWhich is i*(0*0 -0*12s861/41) - j*(sqrt41*0 -0*(16s41/41)) + k*(sqrt41*(12s861/41) -0*(16s41/41))\n\nSo, cross product is (0,0, (sqrt(41)*12 sqrt(861))/41 )\n\nThe magnitude is |(0,0, (12 sqrt(41*861))/41)|\n\nAgain, 41*861=35,301=3*7*41^2, so sqrt(35,301)=41 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, magnitude=12*41 sqrt(21)/41=12 sqrt(21)\n\nThus, area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21)=6 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, each face has area 6 sqrt(21). So, total surface area S=4*6 sqrt(21)=24 sqrt(21)\n\nSo, S=24 sqrt(21)\n\nNow, inradius r= 3V / S= 3*(160/3)/(24 sqrt(21))= (160)/(24 sqrt(21))= (20)/(3 sqrt(21))= (20 sqrt(21))/(3*21)=20 sqrt(21)/63\n\nSimplify 20 and 63: GCD is 1, so it's 20 sqrt(21)/63\n\nSo, the distance is 20 sqrt(21)/63, which can be written as (20 sqrt(21))/63\n\nSo, m=20, n=21, p=63.\n\nCheck if m and p are coprime: 20 and 63 share no common factors besides 1. 21 is square-free.\n\nSo, m +n +p=20 +21 +63=104\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first recognize that the tetrahedron is symmetrical with opposite edges equal. This symmetry allows us to use properties of such tetrahedrons, particularly that all faces are congruent triangles. \n\n### Step 1: Compute the Volume\nWe use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume \\( V \\). The determinant is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{det}(CM) = \n\\begin{vmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\\\\n1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 41 \\\\\n1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 80 \\\\\n1 & 89 & 41 & 80 & 0\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe volume \\( V \\) is calculated using:\n\n\\[\nV^2 = \\frac{1}{288} \\times \\text{det}(CM)\n\\]\n\nAfter computing the determinant and simplifying, we find:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{160}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Surface Area\nEach face of the tetrahedron is a triangle with sides \\( \\sqrt{41} \\), \\( \\sqrt{80} \\), and \\( \\sqrt{89} \\). Using the cross product of vectors, we find the area of one face:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one face} = 6\\sqrt{21}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total surface area \\( S \\) is:\n\n\\[\nS = 4 \\times 6\\sqrt{21} = 24\\sqrt{21}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Inradius\nThe inradius \\( r \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{3V}{S} = \\frac{3 \\times \\frac{160}{3}}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{160}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Express in the Form \\( \\frac{m\\sqrt{n}}{p} \\)\nThe inradius is expressed as \\( \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63} \\), where \\( m = 20 \\), \\( n = 21 \\), and \\( p = 63 \\). These values satisfy the conditions that \\( m \\) and \\( p \\) are coprime, and \\( n \\) is square-free.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\nm + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\n\\]\n\n\\boxed{104}",
