      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC, which is AB\u00b7AC.\n\nHmm, let's start by recalling some basic properties of triangle centers. The circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6. The inradius is related to the area and the semiperimeter, right? The formula is r = area / s, where s is the semiperimeter. The circumradius is related to the sides of the triangle and the area as well. The formula is R = (a\u00b7b\u00b7c) / (4\u00b7area), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. IA is a segment from the incenter to vertex A, and OI is the segment from the circumcenter to the incenter. So, IA \u22a5 OI. I think this might give us a specific relationship between the sides or angles of the triangle.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). Let me check that formula. Oh yes, that's correct. So, OI squared equals R times (R minus 2r). Let me compute that with the given values.\n\nGiven R = 13 and r = 6, so OI\u00b2 = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 =13. So OI is sqrt(13). Wait, but IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle IAO is a right triangle with right angle at A? No, wait. IA is perpendicular to OI, so the right angle is at I. Because IA and OI are perpendicular, so the right angle is at I. So, triangle IAO is a right triangle with legs IA and OI, and hypotenuse AO.\n\nBut AO is the distance from the incenter to vertex A? Wait no, AO is from the circumradius to vertex A. Wait, no, O is the circumcenter, so AO is the circumradius, which is 13. Because in any triangle, the distance from the circumcenter to a vertex is the circumradius R. So AO = 13.\n\nSo, in triangle IAO, AO is 13, OI is sqrt(13), and IA is the inradius? Wait, no, IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A, which isn't necessarily equal to the inradius. The inradius is the distance from the incenter to a side, not to a vertex.\n\nWait, so in triangle IAO, we have a right triangle with legs OI and IA, and hypotenuse AO. So by Pythagoras, AO\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2. We know AO = 13, OI\u00b2 = 13, so 13\u00b2 = 13 + IA\u00b2. So 169 = 13 + IA\u00b2. Therefore, IA\u00b2 = 169 -13 = 156. So IA = sqrt(156). Let me simplify that. 156 is 4*39, so sqrt(4*39)=2*sqrt(39). So IA is 2\u221a39.\n\nHmm, so IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. I wonder if there's a formula that relates IA to other triangle quantities. I think there is. Let me recall. The distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and angles.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = r / sin(A/2). Wait, let me confirm that formula. Yes, I think that's correct. IA is equal to the inradius divided by the sine of half angle A. So IA = r / sin(A/2). So in this case, IA is 2\u221a39, and r is 6.\n\nSo, 2\u221a39 = 6 / sin(A/2). Let me solve for sin(A/2). So sin(A/2) = 6 / (2\u221a39) = 3 / \u221a39. Let me rationalize that. Multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a39: (3\u221a39)/39 = \u221a39 / 13. So sin(A/2) = \u221a39 /13.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check. Alternatively, I think there's another formula for IA: IA = (r) / sin(A/2). So that would be 6 / sin(A/2) = 2\u221a39. So sin(A/2) = 6 / (2\u221a39) = 3 / \u221a39, which is the same as above. So sin(A/2) = \u221a39 /13.\n\nWait, but sqrt(39) is approximately 6.245, so sqrt(39)/13 is about 0.48, which is less than 1, so that makes sense for a sine value.\n\nNow, from this, I can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1. So cos\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 -39)/169 =130/169. So cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13. Since angle A is in a triangle, A/2 is acute, so cosine is positive.\n\nNow, I also know that in a triangle, the area can be expressed as r*s, where s is the semiperimeter. And also, the area can be expressed as (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides. Also, the area can be expressed using the formula (1/2)*ab*sin C.\n\nBut I'm trying to find AB\u00b7AC, which are sides c and b in standard notation. Wait, in standard triangle notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. So AB is c, AC is b. So AB\u00b7AC is b*c.\n\nHmm, so I need to find the product of sides b and c.\n\nLet me think about how to relate these. Maybe using the formula for the area in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter. Area = r*s =6*s, where s=(a+b+c)/2.\n\nAlso, area can be expressed as (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo equating the two expressions for area: 6s = (a b c)/52. So, a b c = 6s *52 = 312 s.\n\nBut I don't know a, b, c, or s yet. Maybe I can find another relationship.\n\nAlternatively, since I have information about angles, perhaps I can relate the sides through the Law of Sines or Cosines.\n\nWait, from the Law of Sines, we have a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C. Since R is 13, so a=26 sin A, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.\n\nSo, the product b*c would be (26 sin B)(26 sin C) = 676 sin B sin C.\n\nBut I need to find sin B and sin C. Hmm, maybe I can find angle A first.\n\nEarlier, I found sin(A/2) = \u221a39 /13. So angle A/2 is arcsin(\u221a39 /13). Let me compute sin A and cos A.\n\nUsing the double-angle formulas:\n\nsin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(\u221a39/13)*(\u221a130/13) = 2*(\u221a(39*130))/169.\n\nCompute 39*130: 39*130 = (40-1)*130 = 40*130 -130 =5200 -130=5070.\n\nSo sin A = 2*sqrt(5070)/169. Hmm, sqrt(5070) is a bit messy. Let me see if 5070 can be simplified. 5070 divided by 10 is 507. 507 is 13*39, which is 13*13*3. Wait, 13*39=507. So sqrt(5070)=sqrt(10*507)=sqrt(10*13*39)=sqrt(10*13*13*3)=13*sqrt(30). Because 10*3=30.\n\nWait, 5070 = 10 * 507 = 10 * 13 * 39 = 10 *13 *13 *3. So sqrt(5070)=sqrt(10*13\u00b2*3)=13*sqrt(30). So sin A = 2*(13\u221a30)/169 = (26\u221a30)/169 = 2\u221a30/13.\n\nSo sin A = 2\u221a30/13. Then, cos A can be found using sin\u00b2A + cos\u00b2A=1. So cos\u00b2A =1 - (4*30)/(13\u00b2)=1 - 120/169=49/169. So cos A=7/13 or -7/13. But since angle A is in a triangle, it's between 0 and 180 degrees, so cos A is positive if A is acute, negative if obtuse. Let's see.\n\nFrom sin(A/2)=\u221a39/13\u22480.48, which is about 28.6 degrees. So A is approximately 57.2 degrees, so it's acute. So cos A=7/13.\n\nOkay, so cos A=7/13. Now, in a triangle, the Law of Cosines says a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A. So a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13).\n\nBut I don't know a, b, c yet. Hmm.\n\nWait, but I also have the area expressed in terms of r and s, which is 6s. So area=6s.\n\nAlso, area can be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A. Because area = (1/2)*ab sin C, but here, considering sides b and c with angle A between them. So area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nSo, 6s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nWe know sin A is 2\u221a30/13, so:\n\n6s = (1/2)*b*c*(2\u221a30/13) \u2192 6s = (b c \u221a30)/13.\n\nSo, b c = (6s *13)/\u221a30 = (78 s)/\u221a30.\n\nBut s is the semiperimeter: s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nHmm, so I have bc expressed in terms of s. But I need another equation to relate a, b, c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express a in terms of b and c using the Law of Cosines.\n\nWe have a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13). So a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nAlso, from the Law of Sines, a = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2\u221a30/13) = 26*(2\u221a30/13)=4\u221a30. So a=4\u221a30.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = (4\u221a30)^2 = 16*30=480.\n\nSo, 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nAlso, from the area expression, 6s = (b c \u221a30)/13 \u2192 6*( (a + b + c)/2 ) = (b c \u221a30)/13 \u2192 3*(a + b + c) = (b c \u221a30)/13.\n\nWe know a=4\u221a30, so:\n\n3*(4\u221a30 + b + c) = (b c \u221a30)/13.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n12\u221a30 + 3b + 3c = (b c \u221a30)/13.\n\nHmm, let me rearrange this:\n\nMultiply both sides by 13 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n13*12\u221a30 + 13*3b + 13*3c = b c \u221a30.\n\nSo,\n\n156\u221a30 + 39b + 39c = b c \u221a30.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nb c \u221a30 - 39b -39c =156\u221a30.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps I can factor it or find a way to express it in terms of bc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express this as:\n\n\u221a30 (b c - 156) = 39(b + c).\n\nSo,\n\nb c -156 = (39 / \u221a30)(b + c).\n\nBut 39 / \u221a30 can be rationalized as (39\u221a30)/30 = (13\u221a30)/10.\n\nSo,\n\nb c -156 = (13\u221a30 /10)(b + c).\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Let me think about another approach.\n\nEarlier, I had a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc. Since a\u00b2 is 480, this gives:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc = 480.\n\nLet me denote bc as k. So, bc = k. Then, we have:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 480 + (14/13)k.\n\nBut from the area equation, 6s = (k \u221a30)/13, which gives s = (k \u221a30)/(78).\n\nBut s is (a + b + c)/2 = (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n(4\u221a30 + b + c)/2 = (k \u221a30)/78 \u2192 4\u221a30 + b + c = (2 k \u221a30)/78 = (k \u221a30)/39.\n\nHmm, so:\n\nb + c = (k \u221a30)/39 -4\u221a30.\n\nHmm, but I also have from the equation earlier:\n\n\u221a30 (k - 156) = 39(b + c).\n\nSubstituting b + c from above:\n\n\u221a30 (k -156) = 39*( (k \u221a30)/39 -4\u221a30 )\n\nSimplify the RHS:\n\n= 39*(k \u221a30 /39) -39*4\u221a30\n= k\u221a30 - 156\u221a30.\n\nSo, \u221a30 (k -156) = k\u221a30 -156\u221a30.\n\nWait, that's:\n\nLeft side: \u221a30 k - \u221a30*156.\n\nRight side: k\u221a30 -156\u221a30.\n\nSo, both sides are equal. So this doesn't give any new information. Hmm, seems like I'm going in circles.\n\nMaybe I need another equation. Let's see. We have two equations:\n\n1) b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13)k = 480.\n\n2) From the area, 6s = (k \u221a30)/13 \u2192 s = (k \u221a30)/(78).\n\nAnd s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2 = (k \u221a30)/78.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n4\u221a30 + b + c = (2 k \u221a30)/78 = (k \u221a30)/39.\n\nSo, b + c = (k \u221a30)/39 -4\u221a30.\n\nLet me call this equation (3).\n\nNow, let me denote equation (1) as:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =480 + (14/13)k.\n\nI also know that (b + c)^2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2bc.\n\nSo, (b + c)^2 = [480 + (14/13)k] + 2k.\n\nFrom equation (3), b + c = (k\u221a30)/39 -4\u221a30.\n\nSo, (b + c)^2 = [ (k\u221a30)/39 -4\u221a30 ]\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute this square:\n\n= [ (k\u221a30)/39 ]\u00b2 - 2*(k\u221a30)/39 *4\u221a30 + (4\u221a30)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (k\u00b2 *30)/(39\u00b2) = (30 k\u00b2)/(1521) = (10 k\u00b2)/(507).\n\nSecond term: -2*(k\u221a30)/39 *4\u221a30 = -2*(4k *30)/39 = -240k /39 = -80k/13.\n\nThird term: (16*30) = 480.\n\nSo, (b + c)^2 = (10 k\u00b2)/507 - (80k)/13 + 480.\n\nBut from the expansion using equation (1):\n\n(b + c)^2 = [480 + (14/13)k ] + 2k = 480 + (14/13 + 26/13)k = 480 + (40/13)k.\n\nSo, equating the two expressions for (b + c)^2:\n\n(10 k\u00b2)/507 - (80k)/13 + 480 = 480 + (40/13)k.\n\nSubtract 480 from both sides:\n\n(10 k\u00b2)/507 - (80k)/13 = (40/13)k.\n\nMultiply both sides by 507 to eliminate denominators:\n\n10k\u00b2 - (80k)(507/13) = (40k)(507/13).\n\nCompute 507 divided by 13: 507 \u00f713=39. Because 13*39=507.\n\nSo,\n\n10k\u00b2 -80k*39 =40k*39.\n\nCompute 80*39: 80*40=3200, minus 80=3120.\n\nSimilarly, 40*39=1560.\n\nSo,\n\n10k\u00b2 -3120k =1560k.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n10k\u00b2 -3120k -1560k =0 \u219210k\u00b2 -4680k=0.\n\nFactor out 10k:\n\n10k(k - 468)=0.\n\nSo, either k=0 or k=468.\n\nk=0 is not possible since sides can't be zero. So, k=468. So, bc=468.\n\nSo, AB\u00b7AC = c\u00b7b =468.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward now. So, the product is 468.\n\nLet me just verify if this makes sense. So, bc=468, which is the product we needed. Let me check the steps quickly.\n\nWe started with IA perpendicular to OI, found IA=2\u221a39, then sin(A/2)=\u221a39/13, leading to sin A=2\u221a30/13, cos A=7/13. Then, using Law of Cosines, a=4\u221a30, and a\u00b2=480. Then, using area expressions, and through several substitutions, arrived at bc=468.\n\nI think that's correct.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC, which is AB\u00b7AC.\n\nHmm, let's start by recalling some basic properties of triangle centers. The circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6. The inradius is related to the area and the semiperimeter, right? The formula is r = area / s, where s is the semiperimeter. The circumradius is related to the sides of the triangle and the area as well. The formula is R = (a\u00b7b\u00b7c) / (4\u00b7area), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. IA is a segment from the incenter to vertex A, and OI is the segment from the circumcenter to the incenter. So, IA \u22a5 OI. I think this might give us a specific relationship between the sides or angles of the triangle.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). Let me check that formula. Oh yes, that's correct. So, OI squared equals R times (R minus 2r). Let me compute that with the given values.\n\nGiven R = 13 and r = 6, so OI\u00b2 = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 =13. So OI is sqrt(13). Wait, but IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle IAO is a right triangle with right angle at A? No, wait. IA is perpendicular to OI, so the right angle is at I. Because IA and OI are perpendicular, so the right angle is at I. So, triangle IAO is a right triangle with legs IA and OI, and hypotenuse AO.\n\nBut AO is the distance from the incenter to vertex A? Wait no, AO is from the circumradius to vertex A. Wait, no, O is the circumcenter, so AO is the circumradius, which is 13. Because in any triangle, the distance from the circumcenter to a vertex is the circumradius R. So AO = 13.\n\nSo, in triangle IAO, AO is 13, OI is sqrt(13), and IA is the inradius? Wait, no, IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A, which isn't necessarily equal to the inradius. The inradius is the distance from the incenter to a side, not to a vertex.\n\nWait, so in triangle IAO, we have a right triangle with legs OI and IA, and hypotenuse AO. So by Pythagoras, AO\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2. We know AO = 13, OI\u00b2 = 13, so 13\u00b2 = 13 + IA\u00b2. So 169 = 13 + IA\u00b2. Therefore, IA\u00b2 = 169 -13 = 156. So IA = sqrt(156). Let me simplify that. 156 is 4*39, so sqrt(4*39)=2*sqrt(39). So IA is 2\u221a39.\n\nHmm, so IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. I wonder if there's a formula that relates IA to other triangle quantities. I think there is. Let me recall. The distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and angles.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = r / sin(A/2). Wait, let me confirm that formula. Yes, I think that's correct. IA is equal to the inradius divided by the sine of half angle A. So IA = r / sin(A/2). So in this case, IA is 2\u221a39, and r is 6.\n\nSo, 2\u221a39 = 6 / sin(A/2). Let me solve for sin(A/2). So sin(A/2) = 6 / (2\u221a39) = 3 / \u221a39. Let me rationalize that. Multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a39: (3\u221a39)/39 = \u221a39 / 13. So sin(A/2) = \u221a39 /13.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check. Alternatively, I think there's another formula for IA: IA = (r) / sin(A/2). So that would be 6 / sin(A/2) = 2\u221a39. So sin(A/2) = 6 / (2\u221a39) = 3 / \u221a39, which is the same as above. So sin(A/2) = \u221a39 /13.\n\nWait, but sqrt(39) is approximately 6.245, so sqrt(39)/13 is about 0.48, which is less than 1, so that makes sense for a sine value.\n\nNow, from this, I can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1. So cos\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 -39)/169 =130/169. So cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13. Since angle A is in a triangle, A/2 is acute, so cosine is positive.\n\nNow, I also know that in a triangle, the area can be expressed as r*s, where s is the semiperimeter. And also, the area can be expressed as (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides. Also, the area can be expressed using the formula (1/2)*ab*sin C.\n\nBut I'm trying to find AB\u00b7AC, which are sides c and b in standard notation. Wait, in standard triangle notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. So AB is c, AC is b. So AB\u00b7AC is b*c.\n\nHmm, so I need to find the product of sides b and c.\n\nLet me think about how to relate these. Maybe using the formula for the area in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter. Area = r*s =6*s, where s=(a+b+c)/2.\n\nAlso, area can be expressed as (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo equating the two expressions for area: 6s = (a b c)/52. So, a b c = 6s *52 = 312 s.\n\nBut I don't know a, b, c, or s yet. Maybe I can find another relationship.\n\nAlternatively, since I have information about angles, perhaps I can relate the sides through the Law of Sines or Cosines.\n\nWait, from the Law of Sines, we have a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C. Since R is 13, so a=26 sin A, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.\n\nSo, the product b*c would be (26 sin B)(26 sin C) = 676 sin B sin C.\n\nBut I need to find sin B and sin C. Hmm, maybe I can find angle A first.\n\nEarlier, I found sin(A/2) = \u221a39 /13. So angle A/2 is arcsin(\u221a39 /13). Let me compute sin A and cos A.\n\nUsing the double-angle formulas:\n\nsin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(\u221a39/13)*(\u221a130/13) = 2*(\u221a(39*130))/169.\n\nCompute 39*130: 39*130 = (40-1)*130 = 40*130 -130 =5200 -130=5070.\n\nSo sin A = 2*sqrt(5070)/169. Hmm, sqrt(5070) is a bit messy. Let me see if 5070 can be simplified. 5070 divided by 10 is 507. 507 is 13*39, which is 13*13*3. Wait, 13*39=507. So sqrt(5070)=sqrt(10*507)=sqrt(10*13*39)=sqrt(10*13*13*3)=13*sqrt(30). Because 10*3=30.\n\nWait, 5070 = 10 * 507 = 10 * 13 * 39 = 10 *13 *13 *3. So sqrt(5070)=sqrt(10*13\u00b2*3)=13*sqrt(30). So sin A = 2*(13\u221a30)/169 = (26\u221a30)/169 = 2\u221a30/13.\n\nSo sin A = 2\u221a30/13. Then, cos A can be found using sin\u00b2A + cos\u00b2A=1. So cos\u00b2A =1 - (4*30)/(13\u00b2)=1 - 120/169=49/169. So cos A=7/13 or -7/13. But since angle A is in a triangle, it's between 0 and 180 degrees, so cos A is positive if A is acute, negative if obtuse. Let's see.\n\nFrom sin(A/2)=\u221a39/13\u22480.48, which is about 28.6 degrees. So A is approximately 57.2 degrees, so it's acute. So cos A=7/13.\n\nOkay, so cos A=7/13. Now, in a triangle, the Law of Cosines says a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A. So a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13).\n\nBut I don't know a, b, c yet. Hmm.\n\nWait, but I also have the area expressed in terms of r and s, which is 6s. So area=6s.\n\nAlso, area can be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A. Because area = (1/2)*ab sin C, but here, considering sides b and c with angle A between them. So area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nSo, 6s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nWe know sin A is 2\u221a30/13, so:\n\n6s = (1/2)*b*c*(2\u221a30/13) \u2192 6s = (b c \u221a30)/13.\n\nSo, b c = (6s *13)/\u221a30 = (78 s)/\u221a30.\n\nBut s is the semiperimeter: s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nHmm, so I have bc expressed in terms of s. But I need another equation to relate a, b, c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express a in terms of b and c using the Law of Cosines.\n\nWe have a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13). So a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nAlso, from the Law of Sines, a = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2\u221a30/13) = 26*(2\u221a30/13)=4\u221a30. So a=4\u221a30.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = (4\u221a30)^2 = 16*30=480.\n\nSo, 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nAlso, from the area expression, 6s = (b c \u221a30)/13 \u2192 6*( (a + b + c)/2 ) = (b c \u221a30)/13 \u2192 3*(a + b + c) = (b c \u221a30)/13.\n\nWe know a=4\u221a30, so:\n\n3*(4\u221a30 + b + c) = (b c \u221a30)/13.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n12\u221a30 + 3b + 3c = (b c \u221a30)/13.\n\nHmm, let me rearrange this:\n\nMultiply both sides by 13 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n13*12\u221a30 + 13*3b + 13*3c = b c \u221a30.\n\nSo,\n\n156\u221a30 + 39b + 39c = b c \u221a30.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nb c \u221a30 - 39b -39c =156\u221a30.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps I can factor it or find a way to express it in terms of bc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express this as:\n\n\u221a30 (b c - 156) = 39(b + c).\n\nSo,\n\nb c -156 = (39 / \u221a30)(b + c).\n\nBut 39 / \u221a30 can be rationalized as (39\u221a30)/30 = (13\u221a30)/10.\n\nSo,\n\nb c -156 = (13\u221a30 /10)(b + c).\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Let me think about another approach.\n\nEarlier, I had a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc. Since a\u00b2 is 480, this gives:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc = 480.\n\nLet me denote bc as k. So, bc = k. Then, we have:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 480 + (14/13)k.\n\nBut from the area equation, 6s = (k \u221a30)/13, which gives s = (k \u221a30)/(78).\n\nBut s is (a + b + c)/2 = (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n(4\u221a30 + b + c)/2 = (k \u221a30)/78 \u2192 4\u221a30 + b + c = (2 k \u221a30)/78 = (k \u221a30)/39.\n\nHmm, so:\n\nb + c = (k \u221a30)/39 -4\u221a30.\n\nHmm, but I also have from the equation earlier:\n\n\u221a30 (k - 156) = 39(b + c).\n\nSubstituting b + c from above:\n\n\u221a30 (k -156) = 39*( (k \u221a30)/39 -4\u221a30 )\n\nSimplify the RHS:\n\n= 39*(k \u221a30 /39) -39*4\u221a30\n= k\u221a30 - 156\u221a30.\n\nSo, \u221a30 (k -156) = k\u221a30 -156\u221a30.\n\nWait, that's:\n\nLeft side: \u221a30 k - \u221a30*156.\n\nRight side: k\u221a30 -156\u221a30.\n\nSo, both sides are equal. So this doesn't give any new information. Hmm, seems like I'm going in circles.\n\nMaybe I need another equation. Let's see. We have two equations:\n\n1) b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13)k = 480.\n\n2) From the area, 6s = (k \u221a30)/13 \u2192 s = (k \u221a30)/(78).\n\nAnd s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2 = (k \u221a30)/78.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n4\u221a30 + b + c = (2 k \u221a30)/78 = (k \u221a30)/39.\n\nSo, b + c = (k \u221a30)/39 -4\u221a30.\n\nLet me call this equation (3).\n\nNow, let me denote equation (1) as:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =480 + (14/13)k.\n\nI also know that (b + c)^2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2bc.\n\nSo, (b + c)^2 = [480 + (14/13)k] + 2k.\n\nFrom equation (3), b + c = (k\u221a30)/39 -4\u221a30.\n\nSo, (b + c)^2 = [ (k\u221a30)/39 -4\u221a30 ]\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute this square:\n\n= [ (k\u221a30)/39 ]\u00b2 - 2*(k\u221a30)/39 *4\u221a30 + (4\u221a30)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (k\u00b2 *30)/(39\u00b2) = (30 k\u00b2)/(1521) = (10 k\u00b2)/(507).\n\nSecond term: -2*(k\u221a30)/39 *4\u221a30 = -2*(4k *30)/39 = -240k /39 = -80k/13.\n\nThird term: (16*30) = 480.\n\nSo, (b + c)^2 = (10 k\u00b2)/507 - (80k)/13 + 480.\n\nBut from the expansion using equation (1):\n\n(b + c)^2 = [480 + (14/13)k ] + 2k = 480 + (14/13 + 26/13)k = 480 + (40/13)k.\n\nSo, equating the two expressions for (b + c)^2:\n\n(10 k\u00b2)/507 - (80k)/13 + 480 = 480 + (40/13)k.\n\nSubtract 480 from both sides:\n\n(10 k\u00b2)/507 - (80k)/13 = (40/13)k.\n\nMultiply both sides by 507 to eliminate denominators:\n\n10k\u00b2 - (80k)(507/13) = (40k)(507/13).\n\nCompute 507 divided by 13: 507 \u00f713=39. Because 13*39=507.\n\nSo,\n\n10k\u00b2 -80k*39 =40k*39.\n\nCompute 80*39: 80*40=3200, minus 80=3120.\n\nSimilarly, 40*39=1560.\n\nSo,\n\n10k\u00b2 -3120k =1560k.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n10k\u00b2 -3120k -1560k =0 \u219210k\u00b2 -4680k=0.\n\nFactor out 10k:\n\n10k(k - 468)=0.\n\nSo, either k=0 or k=468.\n\nk=0 is not possible since sides can't be zero. So, k=468. So, bc=468.\n\nSo, AB\u00b7AC = c\u00b7b =468.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward now. So, the product is 468.\n\nLet me just verify if this makes sense. So, bc=468, which is the product we needed. Let me check the steps quickly.\n\nWe started with IA perpendicular to OI, found IA=2\u221a39, then sin(A/2)=\u221a39/13, leading to sin A=2\u221a30/13, cos A=7/13. Then, using Law of Cosines, a=4\u221a30, and a\u00b2=480. Then, using area expressions, and through several substitutions, arrived at bc=468.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the circumradius \\( R = 13 \\) and the inradius \\( r = 6 \\). The condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) implies that triangle \\( IAO \\) is a right triangle with legs \\( IA \\) and \\( OI \\), and hypotenuse \\( AO \\).\n\nUsing the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter, \\( OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \\), we find:\n\\[\nOI^2 = 13(13 - 12) = 13.\n\\]\nThus, \\( OI = \\sqrt{13} \\).\n\nSince \\( AO = R = 13 \\) and \\( OI = \\sqrt{13} \\), by the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \\( IAO \\):\n\\[\nAO^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \\implies 13^2 = (\\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \\implies 169 = 13 + IA^2 \\implies IA^2 = 156 \\implies IA = 2\\sqrt{39}.\n\\]\n\nThe distance from the incenter to vertex \\( A \\) is given by \\( IA = \\frac{r}{\\sin(A/2)} \\). Substituting \\( IA = 2\\sqrt{39} \\) and \\( r = 6 \\):\n\\[\n2\\sqrt{39} = \\frac{6}{\\sin(A/2)} \\implies \\sin(A/2) = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{39}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the double-angle identity for sine:\n\\[\n\\sin A = 2 \\sin(A/2) \\cos(A/2) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13} \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13}\\right)^2} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13}.\n\\]\n\nFrom the Law of Sines, the side opposite angle \\( A \\) is:\n\\[\na = 2R \\sin A = 2 \\cdot 13 \\cdot \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13} = 4\\sqrt{30}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the area formula \\( \\text{Area} = r \\cdot s \\) and \\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{abc}{4R} \\), where \\( s \\) is the semiperimeter, we equate:\n\\[\n6s = \\frac{abc}{52} \\implies abc = 312s.\n\\]\n\nFrom the Law of Cosines:\n\\[\na^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A \\implies 480 = b^2 + c^2 - \\frac{14}{13}bc.\n\\]\n\nUsing the area formula \\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A \\):\n\\[\n6s = \\frac{1}{2}bc \\cdot \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13} \\implies 6s = \\frac{bc\\sqrt{30}}{13}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( s = \\frac{a + b + c}{2} \\) and solving for \\( bc \\), we find:\n\\[\nbc = 468.\n\\]\n\nThus, the product \\( AB \\cdot AC \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{468}.\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst off, I remember that in any triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides and the area. The formula for the circumradius is R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where a, b, c are the sides, and \u0394 is the area. But I don't know the sides yet, so maybe that's not directly helpful yet.\n\nThe inradius r is given by r = \u0394/s, where s is the semi-perimeter. Here, r is 6, so \u0394 = 6s. That might come in handy later.\n\nNow, the key condition here is that IA is perpendicular to OI. IA is the segment from the incenter I to vertex A, and OI is the segment from the circumcenter O to the incenter I. Their perpendicularity is a crucial piece of information.\n\nI think I should recall the formula or relation that connects the distance between the incenter and circumcenter with other elements of the triangle. I remember that in any triangle, the distance between O and I is given by OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)). Let me verify that formula. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, plugging in R = 13 and r = 6, we get OI = sqrt(13*(13 - 12)) = sqrt(13*1) = sqrt(13). So OI is sqrt(13).\n\nWait, but the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle IAO is a right triangle with right angle at A. Or wait, no, actually, IA is perpendicular to OI, meaning that the lines IA and OI are perpendicular to each other. So, in triangle IAO, angle at I is 90 degrees? Or wait, no, the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. So, in triangle IAO, the angle at I is 90 degrees.\n\nWait, no. IA is a segment from I to A, and OI is from O to I. So, IA and OI are two lines intersecting at I. So, the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. So, at point I, the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. So, triangle IAO is a right triangle with right angle at I.\n\nWait, but in triangle IAO, O is the circumcenter, I is the incenter, and A is a vertex. So, if the angle at I is 90 degrees, then by the Pythagorean theorem, OA\u00b2 = IO\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nBut OA is the circumradius, which is 13. IO is sqrt(13), as we found earlier. IA is the length from incenter I to vertex A. Hmm, I don't know IA yet, but maybe I can find it.\n\nWait, but in triangle IAO, OA is 13, IO is sqrt(13), and IA is sqrt(OA\u00b2 - IO\u00b2) = sqrt(169 - 13) = sqrt(156). So IA is sqrt(156). Hmm, sqrt(156) can be simplified, right? 156 is 4*39, so sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). So IA is 2*sqrt(39).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's directly helpful yet. Let me think about other properties.\n\nI also remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the angles and the inradius. Specifically, IA = r / sin(A/2), where A is the angle at vertex A. Wait, let me verify that formula.\n\nWait, actually, the formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A is IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Is that correct? Hmm, I think so because in the inradius, the inradius is related to the angles. Alternatively, another formula I remember is IA = (2*r) / (1 - cos A), but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should derive it.\n\nAlternatively, in triangle AIO, which is a right triangle at I, we have IA perpendicular to OI. So, IA is perpendicular to OI, which is the line connecting the inradius and the circumradius. So, perhaps I can use some trigonometric relations here.\n\nWait, maybe I should recall that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. For example, IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Let me check that.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. Because in the inradius, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side, and IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. So, in the right triangle formed by I, A, and the point where the inradius touches side BC, the angle at I is A/2. So, sin(A/2) = r / IA, which implies IA = r / sin(A/2). So, yes, IA = r / sin(A/2).\n\nSo, IA is 6 / sin(A/2). But from earlier, we found IA is 2*sqrt(39). Therefore, 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39). Solving for sin(A/2), we get sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13. Wait, because 3/sqrt(39) can be rationalized as (3*sqrt(39))/39 = sqrt(39)/13. So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nHmm, okay. So, sin(A/2) is sqrt(39)/13. Let me write that down.\n\nNow, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. So, using the identity cos(A) = 1 - 2*sin\u00b2(A/2), let's compute cos A.\n\nWait, cos A = 1 - 2*sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 - 78)/169 = 91/169. So, cos A is 91/169.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute cos(A) as (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2)/(2bc), using the Law of Cosines. But maybe that's more complicated. Let's see.\n\nBut wait, perhaps we can find angle A from sin(A/2). Since sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, we can find cos(A/2) using the identity cos\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 39/169 = 130/169. So, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nThen, using the double-angle formula, cos A = 2*cos\u00b2(A/2) - 1 = 2*(130/169) - 1 = 260/169 - 1 = (260 - 169)/169 = 91/169, which matches what I found earlier. So, cos A is 91/169.\n\nNow, with cos A known, perhaps I can find AB * AC, which is the product of sides AB and AC. Let's denote AB as c, BC as a, and AC as b, following the standard notation where a is opposite angle A, etc. Wait no, actually, in standard notation, a is BC, opposite angle A; b is AC, opposite angle B; and c is AB, opposite angle C. So, AB is c, AC is b, and BC is a.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for AB multiplied by AC, which is c*b. So, I need to find c*b.\n\nHmm. I know that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the area and the sine of the included angle. Specifically, (AB)(AC) = 2\u0394 / sin A. Wait, because the area \u0394 is (1/2)*AB*AC*sin A, so AB*AC = 2\u0394 / sin A.\n\nI know that \u0394 is the area, which we can express in terms of the inradius and semi-perimeter. Since r = 6 and \u0394 = r*s, where s is the semi-perimeter, then \u0394 = 6s.\n\nSo, AB * AC = 2*(6s) / sin A = 12s / sin A.\n\nBut I don't know s or sin A yet. Alternatively, maybe I can find sin A from the information I have.\n\nWait, since I know cos A is 91/169, I can find sin A using the identity sin\u00b2 A + cos\u00b2 A = 1. So, sin\u00b2 A = 1 - (91/169)^2 = (169\u00b2 - 91\u00b2)/169\u00b2. Let me compute 169\u00b2: 169*169. Hmm, 170\u00b2 is 28900, so 169\u00b2 is 28900 - 2*170 +1 = 28900 - 340 + 1 = 28561. Similarly, 91\u00b2 is 8281. So, sin\u00b2 A = (28561 - 8281)/28561 = (20280)/28561.\n\nWait, 20280 \u00f7 28561: Let me see, 20280 is 28561*(20280/28561). Let me compute that fraction.\n\nWait, alternatively, sqrt(20280)/169, because sin A = sqrt(20280)/169. Let me compute sqrt(20280). Hmm, 20280 is 4*5070, which is 4*5070. Wait, 5070 is 10*507, which is 10*13*39. So, 20280 = 4*10*13*39 = 4*10*13*3*13. So, sqrt(20280) = sqrt(4*10*3*13\u00b2) )= 2*13*sqrt(10*3) )= 26*sqrt(30). So, sin A = 26*sqrt(30)/169 = (26/169)*sqrt(30) = (2*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, sin A is (2*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, going back, AB * AC = 12s / sin A. Hmm, but I don't know s yet. So, perhaps I can find s another way.\n\nI know that the circumradius R = 13. The formula for the circumradius is R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394). So, 13 = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394). But \u0394 is 6s, so 13 = (a*b*c)/(4*6s) = (a*b*c)/(24s).\n\nHmm, that gives a*b*c = 13*24s = 312s. So, a*b*c = 312s.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful yet. Let me think about other relations.\n\nWait, another formula involving the inradius is r = (\u0394)/s, which we already used. Also, maybe I can find the sides using the Law of Cosines. Since I know cos A, I can write a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*cos A.\n\nBut I don't know a, b, or c yet. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find expressions for b and c in terms of other variables. Let me think.\n\nWait, I also know that the distance from I to A is IA = 2*sqrt(39), as we found earlier. And IA is also equal to (r)/(sin(A/2)) = 6/(sqrt(39)/13) = 6*13/sqrt(39) = 78/sqrt(39) = (78*sqrt(39))/39 = 2*sqrt(39). So that checks out.\n\nBut maybe I can find other distances like IB and IC, but I'm not sure if that's necessary.\n\nWait, let me try to find angle A. Since we have cos A = 91/169, and sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13. So, angle A is arccos(91/169), which is approximately... Well, maybe I don't need the numerical value.\n\nNow, let's think about the product AB*AC = c*b. From earlier, I have AB*AC = 12s / sin A. Since sin A is 2*sqrt(30)/13, then AB*AC = 12s / (2*sqrt(30)/13) )= 12s * (13)/(2*sqrt(30)) )= (12*13*s)/(2*sqrt(30)) )= (6*13*s)/sqrt(30) )= (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nBut I need to find s, the semi-perimeter. Hmm. How?\n\nWell, s = (a + b + c)/2. So, if I can find a, b, c, that would be great, but I don't have enough information yet.\n\nWait, let me think about the formula involving the distance between O and I. Earlier, we used OI^2 = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13). But in triangle IAO, which is right-angled at I, we have OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2, which we used earlier.\n\nWait, but I also know that in any triangle, the distance from the incenter to the circumcenter can be related to the sides and angles. Maybe there's another formula that connects OI, R, r, and other elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use trigonometric identities involving angle A and the sides.\n\nWait, another thought: In triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A can also be expressed using the formula IA = (2R sin (A/2)). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me check. I think IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)), but also, perhaps in terms of R, maybe IA can be expressed as something else.\n\nWait, I found earlier that IA is 2*sqrt(39), which is about 12.4096. Alternatively, if IA = 2R sin(A/2), then 2*13*sin(A/2) = 26*sin(A/2). But from earlier, IA is 2*sqrt(39) \u2248 12.4096, so 26*sin(A/2) = 12.4096 \u2192 sin(A/2) \u2248 0.4773, which matches our earlier calculation since sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13 \u2248 0.4773.\n\nWait, so IA can be expressed as 2R sin(A/2). So, IA = 2R sin(A/2) = 2*13*sin(A/2) = 26 sin(A/2). But earlier, we found that IA = 2*sqrt(39). So, 26 sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39) \u2192 sin(A/2) = (2*sqrt(39))/26 = sqrt(39)/13, which is consistent with what we had before.\n\nSo, that's another way to get sin(A/2).\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that helps us directly with finding s.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find the sides in terms of the angles. Let me think about the Law of Sines, which says that a/sin A = 2R = 26. So, a = 26 sin A. Similarly, b = 26 sin B and c = 26 sin C.\n\nWait, that's a useful relation. So, a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSince I know sin A and cos A, maybe I can find expressions for sin B and sin C in terms of angle A.\n\nWait, but in a triangle, angles B and C are related to angle A by A + B + C = 180 degrees. So, perhaps if I can find angle B and angle C in terms of angle A, I can express the sides in terms of angle A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the semi-perimeter s in terms of the sides.\n\nBut perhaps I can find s using the formula s = (a + b + c)/2. But since a, b, c are all expressed in terms of R and the angles, maybe I can express s in terms of angles.\n\nWait, but that might get complicated. Let me try another approach.\n\nI know that in any triangle, the product bc can be expressed using the formula from the Law of Cosines. Since a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A. Hmm, but I don't know a yet.\n\nWait, but a is the side opposite angle A, so a = 2R sin A = 26 sin A. And sin A is 2*sqrt(30)/13, so a = 26*(2*sqrt(30)/13) )= 2*2*sqrt(30) )= 4*sqrt(30). So, a = 4*sqrt(30).\n\nNow, a\u00b2 = (4*sqrt(30))\u00b2 = 16*30 = 480.\n\nSo, from the Law of Cosines, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A. Plugging in a\u00b2 = 480, cos A = 91/169, we get:\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(91/169).\n\nHmm, but that's one equation with two variables, b and c. I need another equation to relate b and c.\n\nWait, I also know that the area \u0394 = 6s, and from the Law of Sines, \u0394 can also be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A. So, (1/2)*b*c*sin A = 6s.\n\nSince sin A is (2*sqrt(30))/13, this becomes (1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) )= 6s \u2192 (b*c*sqrt(30))/13 = 6s \u2192 b*c = (6s*13)/sqrt(30) )= (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nWait, but from earlier, I had AB*AC = c*b = (78 s)/sqrt(30). So, that's consistent.\n\nBut I still don't know s. Let me think about other relations.\n\nI also know that s = (a + b + c)/2. And from the Law of Sines, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nHmm, but without knowing angles B and C, that might not help directly.\n\nWait, another thought: The formula for the inradius is r = (\u0394)/s, so \u0394 = 6s. But \u0394 is also (1/2)*b*c*sin A. So, 6s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A \u2192 12s = b*c*sin A.\n\nBut we have sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13, so 12s = b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) \u2192 12s = (2*sqrt(30)/13)*b*c \u2192 b*c = (12s *13)/(2*sqrt(30)) )= (6*13 s)/sqrt(30) )= (78 s)/sqrt(30). Which is what I had earlier.\n\nSo, that's consistent, but it doesn't help me find s.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find another equation involving b and c. Let's go back to the Law of Cosines equation:\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(91/169).\n\nHmm, and I also have from the Law of Sines that b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C. And since A + B + C = 180\u00b0, I can write B + C = 180\u00b0 - A.\n\nSo, maybe I can express sin B and sin C in terms of angle A. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in a triangle, the sum of the angles is 180\u00b0, and use the sine of sum identities.\n\nWait, but that might get complicated. Let me think if there's another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula for the inradius in terms of the sides. The inradius r = (\u0394)/s = 6, and \u0394 is 6s. So, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula that relates the distance between O and I to other elements. We had OI^2 = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).\n\nBut I also know that OI^2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, that's the same as OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, another thought: In triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter I to the circumradius O is sqrt(13), and IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IAO, which is right-angled at I, we can perhaps find the length AI, which we did as 2*sqrt(39).\n\nWait, but maybe I can use some vector geometry here. Hmm, but that might be overcomplicating things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the length of AI in terms of the sides. Wait, I know that IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)) = 6/(sqrt(39)/13) )= 78/sqrt(39) )= 2*sqrt(39), which is consistent.\n\nWait, maybe I can find the semi-perimeter s using the formula involving exradii or something else, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's denote that AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a = 4*sqrt(30). Then, the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nFrom the area formula, \u0394 = 6s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A. So, 6s = (1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) \u2192 6s = (b*c*sqrt(30))/13 \u2192 b*c = (6s*13)/sqrt(30) \u2192 b*c = (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nBut I also have from the Law of Cosines:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A \u2192 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(91/169).\n\nHmm, so I have two equations:\n\n1) b*c = (78 s)/sqrt(30)\n\n2) 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (182 bc)/169\n\nBut I also know that s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4*sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I can find another relation.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express b + c in terms of s. Since s = (a + b + c)/2, then b + c = 2s - a = 2s - 4*sqrt(30).\n\nNow, from equation 1, bc = (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nSo, perhaps I can write equation 2 in terms of s.\n\nEquation 2: 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (182 bc)/169.\n\nBut b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 can be written as (b + c)^2 - 2bc. So, substituting:\n\n480 = (b + c)^2 - 2bc - (182 bc)/169.\n\nSubstituting b + c = 2s - 4*sqrt(30) and bc = (78 s)/sqrt(30):\n\n480 = (2s - 4*sqrt(30))^2 - 2*(78 s)/sqrt(30) - (182*(78 s)/sqrt(30))/169.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, expand (2s - 4*sqrt(30))^2:\n\n= (2s)^2 - 2*(2s)*(4*sqrt(30)) + (4*sqrt(30))^2\n= 4s\u00b2 - 16s*sqrt(30) + 16*30\n= 4s\u00b2 - 16s*sqrt(30) + 480.\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes:\n\n480 = [4s\u00b2 - 16s*sqrt(30) + 480] - 2*(78 s)/sqrt(30) - (182*78 s)/(169*sqrt(30)).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n- The first part is 4s\u00b2 - 16s*sqrt(30) + 480.\n\n- The second term is -2*(78 s)/sqrt(30) = -156 s / sqrt(30).\n\n- The third term is -(182*78 s)/(169*sqrt(30)).\n\nLet me compute 182*78 first. 182*78: 180*78=14,040; 2*78=156 \u2192 total 14,040 + 156 = 14,196.\n\nSo, the third term is -14,196 s / (169*sqrt(30)).\n\nSimplify 14,196 / 169. Let's compute 169*84 = 14,196 (since 170*84=14,280, subtract 1*84=84 \u2192 14,280-84=14,196). So, 14,196/169 = 84.\n\nSo, the third term is -84 s / sqrt(30).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n480 = 4s\u00b2 - 16s*sqrt(30) + 480 - (156 s)/sqrt(30) - (84 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n480 = 4s\u00b2 - 16s*sqrt(30) + 480 - [156 + 84] s / sqrt(30).\n\nSo, 480 = 4s\u00b2 - 16s*sqrt(30) + 480 - (240 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nNow, subtract 480 from both sides:\n\n0 = 4s\u00b2 - 16s*sqrt(30) - (240 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nFactor out s:\n\n0 = 4s\u00b2 - s*(16*sqrt(30) + 240/sqrt(30)).\n\nLet me compute 16*sqrt(30) + 240/sqrt(30):\n\nCompute each term:\n\n16*sqrt(30) = 16*sqrt(30).\n\n240/sqrt(30) = (240*sqrt(30))/30 = 8*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, 16*sqrt(30) + 8*sqrt(30) = 24*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n0 = 4s\u00b2 - s*(24*sqrt(30)).\n\nFactor out 4s:\n\n0 = 4s(s - 6*sqrt(30)).\n\nSo, either 4s = 0 \u2192 s=0 (impossible) or s - 6*sqrt(30) = 0 \u2192 s = 6*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s = 6*sqrt(30).\n\nNow that I have s, I can find bc from equation 1:\n\nbc = (78 s)/sqrt(30) = (78 * 6*sqrt(30)) / sqrt(30) )= 78 *6 * (sqrt(30)/sqrt(30)) )= 78 *6 *1 = 468.\n\nSo, bc = 468. Therefore, AB*AC = c*b = 468.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward now. Let me just verify the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the Law of Cosines equation and substituting all the known values, I eventually found that s = 6*sqrt(30). Then, using bc = (78 s)/sqrt(30), I substituted s and got bc = 468. So, the product AB*AC is 468.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst off, I remember that in any triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides and the area. The formula for the circumradius is R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where a, b, c are the sides, and \u0394 is the area. But I don't know the sides yet, so maybe that's not directly helpful yet.\n\nThe inradius r is given by r = \u0394/s, where s is the semi-perimeter. Here, r is 6, so \u0394 = 6s. That might come in handy later.\n\nNow, the key condition here is that IA is perpendicular to OI. IA is the segment from the incenter I to vertex A, and OI is the segment from the circumcenter O to the incenter I. Their perpendicularity is a crucial piece of information.\n\nI think I should recall the formula or relation that connects the distance between the incenter and circumcenter with other elements of the triangle. I remember that in any triangle, the distance between O and I is given by OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)). Let me verify that formula. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, plugging in R = 13 and r = 6, we get OI = sqrt(13*(13 - 12)) = sqrt(13*1) = sqrt(13). So OI is sqrt(13).\n\nWait, but the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle IAO is a right triangle with right angle at A. Or wait, no, actually, IA is perpendicular to OI, meaning that the lines IA and OI are perpendicular to each other. So, in triangle IAO, angle at I is 90 degrees? Or wait, no, the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. So, in triangle IAO, the angle at I is 90 degrees.\n\nWait, no. IA is a segment from I to A, and OI is from O to I. So, IA and OI are two lines intersecting at I. So, the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. So, at point I, the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. So, triangle IAO is a right triangle with right angle at I.\n\nWait, but in triangle IAO, O is the circumcenter, I is the incenter, and A is a vertex. So, if the angle at I is 90 degrees, then by the Pythagorean theorem, OA\u00b2 = IO\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nBut OA is the circumradius, which is 13. IO is sqrt(13), as we found earlier. IA is the length from incenter I to vertex A. Hmm, I don't know IA yet, but maybe I can find it.\n\nWait, but in triangle IAO, OA is 13, IO is sqrt(13), and IA is sqrt(OA\u00b2 - IO\u00b2) = sqrt(169 - 13) = sqrt(156). So IA is sqrt(156). Hmm, sqrt(156) can be simplified, right? 156 is 4*39, so sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). So IA is 2*sqrt(39).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's directly helpful yet. Let me think about other properties.\n\nI also remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the angles and the inradius. Specifically, IA = r / sin(A/2), where A is the angle at vertex A. Wait, let me verify that formula.\n\nWait, actually, the formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A is IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Is that correct? Hmm, I think so because in the inradius, the inradius is related to the angles. Alternatively, another formula I remember is IA = (2*r) / (1 - cos A), but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should derive it.\n\nAlternatively, in triangle AIO, which is a right triangle at I, we have IA perpendicular to OI. So, IA is perpendicular to OI, which is the line connecting the inradius and the circumradius. So, perhaps I can use some trigonometric relations here.\n\nWait, maybe I should recall that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. For example, IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Let me check that.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. Because in the inradius, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side, and IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. So, in the right triangle formed by I, A, and the point where the inradius touches side BC, the angle at I is A/2. So, sin(A/2) = r / IA, which implies IA = r / sin(A/2). So, yes, IA = r / sin(A/2).\n\nSo, IA is 6 / sin(A/2). But from earlier, we found IA is 2*sqrt(39). Therefore, 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39). Solving for sin(A/2), we get sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13. Wait, because 3/sqrt(39) can be rationalized as (3*sqrt(39))/39 = sqrt(39)/13. So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nHmm, okay. So, sin(A/2) is sqrt(39)/13. Let me write that down.\n\nNow, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. So, using the identity cos(A) = 1 - 2*sin\u00b2(A/2), let's compute cos A.\n\nWait, cos A = 1 - 2*sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 - 78)/169 = 91/169. So, cos A is 91/169.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute cos(A) as (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2)/(2bc), using the Law of Cosines. But maybe that's more complicated. Let's see.\n\nBut wait, perhaps we can find angle A from sin(A/2). Since sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, we can find cos(A/2) using the identity cos\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 39/169 = 130/169. So, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nThen, using the double-angle formula, cos A = 2*cos\u00b2(A/2) - 1 = 2*(130/169) - 1 = 260/169 - 1 = (260 - 169)/169 = 91/169, which matches what I found earlier. So, cos A is 91/169.\n\nNow, with cos A known, perhaps I can find AB * AC, which is the product of sides AB and AC. Let's denote AB as c, BC as a, and AC as b, following the standard notation where a is opposite angle A, etc. Wait no, actually, in standard notation, a is BC, opposite angle A; b is AC, opposite angle B; and c is AB, opposite angle C. So, AB is c, AC is b, and BC is a.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for AB multiplied by AC, which is c*b. So, I need to find c*b.\n\nHmm. I know that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the area and the sine of the included angle. Specifically, (AB)(AC) = 2\u0394 / sin A. Wait, because the area \u0394 is (1/2)*AB*AC*sin A, so AB*AC = 2\u0394 / sin A.\n\nI know that \u0394 is the area, which we can express in terms of the inradius and semi-perimeter. Since r = 6 and \u0394 = r*s, where s is the semi-perimeter, then \u0394 = 6s.\n\nSo, AB * AC = 2*(6s) / sin A = 12s / sin A.\n\nBut I don't know s or sin A yet. Alternatively, maybe I can find sin A from the information I have.\n\nWait, since I know cos A is 91/169, I can find sin A using the identity sin\u00b2 A + cos\u00b2 A = 1. So, sin\u00b2 A = 1 - (91/169)^2 = (169\u00b2 - 91\u00b2)/169\u00b2. Let me compute 169\u00b2: 169*169. Hmm, 170\u00b2 is 28900, so 169\u00b2 is 28900 - 2*170 +1 = 28900 - 340 + 1 = 28561. Similarly, 91\u00b2 is 8281. So, sin\u00b2 A = (28561 - 8281)/28561 = (20280)/28561.\n\nWait, 20280 \u00f7 28561: Let me see, 20280 is 28561*(20280/28561). Let me compute that fraction.\n\nWait, alternatively, sqrt(20280)/169, because sin A = sqrt(20280)/169. Let me compute sqrt(20280). Hmm, 20280 is 4*5070, which is 4*5070. Wait, 5070 is 10*507, which is 10*13*39. So, 20280 = 4*10*13*39 = 4*10*13*3*13. So, sqrt(20280) = sqrt(4*10*3*13\u00b2) )= 2*13*sqrt(10*3) )= 26*sqrt(30). So, sin A = 26*sqrt(30)/169 = (26/169)*sqrt(30) = (2*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, sin A is (2*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, going back, AB * AC = 12s / sin A. Hmm, but I don't know s yet. So, perhaps I can find s another way.\n\nI know that the circumradius R = 13. The formula for the circumradius is R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394). So, 13 = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394). But \u0394 is 6s, so 13 = (a*b*c)/(4*6s) = (a*b*c)/(24s).\n\nHmm, that gives a*b*c = 13*24s = 312s. So, a*b*c = 312s.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful yet. Let me think about other relations.\n\nWait, another formula involving the inradius is r = (\u0394)/s, which we already used. Also, maybe I can find the sides using the Law of Cosines. Since I know cos A, I can write a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*cos A.\n\nBut I don't know a, b, or c yet. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find expressions for b and c in terms of other variables. Let me think.\n\nWait, I also know that the distance from I to A is IA = 2*sqrt(39), as we found earlier. And IA is also equal to (r)/(sin(A/2)) = 6/(sqrt(39)/13) = 6*13/sqrt(39) = 78/sqrt(39) = (78*sqrt(39))/39 = 2*sqrt(39). So that checks out.\n\nBut maybe I can find other distances like IB and IC, but I'm not sure if that's necessary.\n\nWait, let me try to find angle A. Since we have cos A = 91/169, and sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13. So, angle A is arccos(91/169), which is approximately... Well, maybe I don't need the numerical value.\n\nNow, let's think about the product AB*AC = c*b. From earlier, I have AB*AC = 12s / sin A. Since sin A is 2*sqrt(30)/13, then AB*AC = 12s / (2*sqrt(30)/13) )= 12s * (13)/(2*sqrt(30)) )= (12*13*s)/(2*sqrt(30)) )= (6*13*s)/sqrt(30) )= (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nBut I need to find s, the semi-perimeter. Hmm. How?\n\nWell, s = (a + b + c)/2. So, if I can find a, b, c, that would be great, but I don't have enough information yet.\n\nWait, let me think about the formula involving the distance between O and I. Earlier, we used OI^2 = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13). But in triangle IAO, which is right-angled at I, we have OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2, which we used earlier.\n\nWait, but I also know that in any triangle, the distance from the incenter to the circumcenter can be related to the sides and angles. Maybe there's another formula that connects OI, R, r, and other elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use trigonometric identities involving angle A and the sides.\n\nWait, another thought: In triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A can also be expressed using the formula IA = (2R sin (A/2)). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me check. I think IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)), but also, perhaps in terms of R, maybe IA can be expressed as something else.\n\nWait, I found earlier that IA is 2*sqrt(39), which is about 12.4096. Alternatively, if IA = 2R sin(A/2), then 2*13*sin(A/2) = 26*sin(A/2). But from earlier, IA is 2*sqrt(39) \u2248 12.4096, so 26*sin(A/2) = 12.4096 \u2192 sin(A/2) \u2248 0.4773, which matches our earlier calculation since sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13 \u2248 0.4773.\n\nWait, so IA can be expressed as 2R sin(A/2). So, IA = 2R sin(A/2) = 2*13*sin(A/2) = 26 sin(A/2). But earlier, we found that IA = 2*sqrt(39). So, 26 sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39) \u2192 sin(A/2) = (2*sqrt(39))/26 = sqrt(39)/13, which is consistent with what we had before.\n\nSo, that's another way to get sin(A/2).\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that helps us directly with finding s.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find the sides in terms of the angles. Let me think about the Law of Sines, which says that a/sin A = 2R = 26. So, a = 26 sin A. Similarly, b = 26 sin B and c = 26 sin C.\n\nWait, that's a useful relation. So, a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSince I know sin A and cos A, maybe I can find expressions for sin B and sin C in terms of angle A.\n\nWait, but in a triangle, angles B and C are related to angle A by A + B + C = 180 degrees. So, perhaps if I can find angle B and angle C in terms of angle A, I can express the sides in terms of angle A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the semi-perimeter s in terms of the sides.\n\nBut perhaps I can find s using the formula s = (a + b + c)/2. But since a, b, c are all expressed in terms of R and the angles, maybe I can express s in terms of angles.\n\nWait, but that might get complicated. Let me try another approach.\n\nI know that in any triangle, the product bc can be expressed using the formula from the Law of Cosines. Since a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A. Hmm, but I don't know a yet.\n\nWait, but a is the side opposite angle A, so a = 2R sin A = 26 sin A. And sin A is 2*sqrt(30)/13, so a = 26*(2*sqrt(30)/13) )= 2*2*sqrt(30) )= 4*sqrt(30). So, a = 4*sqrt(30).\n\nNow, a\u00b2 = (4*sqrt(30))\u00b2 = 16*30 = 480.\n\nSo, from the Law of Cosines, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A. Plugging in a\u00b2 = 480, cos A = 91/169, we get:\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(91/169).\n\nHmm, but that's one equation with two variables, b and c. I need another equation to relate b and c.\n\nWait, I also know that the area \u0394 = 6s, and from the Law of Sines, \u0394 can also be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A. So, (1/2)*b*c*sin A = 6s.\n\nSince sin A is (2*sqrt(30))/13, this becomes (1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) )= 6s \u2192 (b*c*sqrt(30))/13 = 6s \u2192 b*c = (6s*13)/sqrt(30) )= (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nWait, but from earlier, I had AB*AC = c*b = (78 s)/sqrt(30). So, that's consistent.\n\nBut I still don't know s. Let me think about other relations.\n\nI also know that s = (a + b + c)/2. And from the Law of Sines, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nHmm, but without knowing angles B and C, that might not help directly.\n\nWait, another thought: The formula for the inradius is r = (\u0394)/s, so \u0394 = 6s. But \u0394 is also (1/2)*b*c*sin A. So, 6s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A \u2192 12s = b*c*sin A.\n\nBut we have sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13, so 12s = b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) \u2192 12s = (2*sqrt(30)/13)*b*c \u2192 b*c = (12s *13)/(2*sqrt(30)) )= (6*13 s)/sqrt(30) )= (78 s)/sqrt(30). Which is what I had earlier.\n\nSo, that's consistent, but it doesn't help me find s.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find another equation involving b and c. Let's go back to the Law of Cosines equation:\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(91/169).\n\nHmm, and I also have from the Law of Sines that b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C. And since A + B + C = 180\u00b0, I can write B + C = 180\u00b0 - A.\n\nSo, maybe I can express sin B and sin C in terms of angle A. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in a triangle, the sum of the angles is 180\u00b0, and use the sine of sum identities.\n\nWait, but that might get complicated. Let me think if there's another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula for the inradius in terms of the sides. The inradius r = (\u0394)/s = 6, and \u0394 is 6s. So, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula that relates the distance between O and I to other elements. We had OI^2 = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).\n\nBut I also know that OI^2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, that's the same as OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, another thought: In triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter I to the circumradius O is sqrt(13), and IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IAO, which is right-angled at I, we can perhaps find the length AI, which we did as 2*sqrt(39).\n\nWait, but maybe I can use some vector geometry here. Hmm, but that might be overcomplicating things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the length of AI in terms of the sides. Wait, I know that IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)) = 6/(sqrt(39)/13) )= 78/sqrt(39) )= 2*sqrt(39), which is consistent.\n\nWait, maybe I can find the semi-perimeter s using the formula involving exradii or something else, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's denote that AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a = 4*sqrt(30). Then, the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nFrom the area formula, \u0394 = 6s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A. So, 6s = (1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) \u2192 6s = (b*c*sqrt(30))/13 \u2192 b*c = (6s*13)/sqrt(30) \u2192 b*c = (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nBut I also have from the Law of Cosines:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A \u2192 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(91/169).\n\nHmm, so I have two equations:\n\n1) b*c = (78 s)/sqrt(30)\n\n2) 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (182 bc)/169\n\nBut I also know that s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4*sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I can find another relation.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express b + c in terms of s. Since s = (a + b + c)/2, then b + c = 2s - a = 2s - 4*sqrt(30).\n\nNow, from equation 1, bc = (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nSo, perhaps I can write equation 2 in terms of s.\n\nEquation 2: 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (182 bc)/169.\n\nBut b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 can be written as (b + c)^2 - 2bc. So, substituting:\n\n480 = (b + c)^2 - 2bc - (182 bc)/169.\n\nSubstituting b + c = 2s - 4*sqrt(30) and bc = (78 s)/sqrt(30):\n\n480 = (2s - 4*sqrt(30))^2 - 2*(78 s)/sqrt(30) - (182*(78 s)/sqrt(30))/169.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, expand (2s - 4*sqrt(30))^2:\n\n= (2s)^2 - 2*(2s)*(4*sqrt(30)) + (4*sqrt(30))^2\n= 4s\u00b2 - 16s*sqrt(30) + 16*30\n= 4s\u00b2 - 16s*sqrt(30) + 480.\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes:\n\n480 = [4s\u00b2 - 16s*sqrt(30) + 480] - 2*(78 s)/sqrt(30) - (182*78 s)/(169*sqrt(30)).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n- The first part is 4s\u00b2 - 16s*sqrt(30) + 480.\n\n- The second term is -2*(78 s)/sqrt(30) = -156 s / sqrt(30).\n\n- The third term is -(182*78 s)/(169*sqrt(30)).\n\nLet me compute 182*78 first. 182*78: 180*78=14,040; 2*78=156 \u2192 total 14,040 + 156 = 14,196.\n\nSo, the third term is -14,196 s / (169*sqrt(30)).\n\nSimplify 14,196 / 169. Let's compute 169*84 = 14,196 (since 170*84=14,280, subtract 1*84=84 \u2192 14,280-84=14,196). So, 14,196/169 = 84.\n\nSo, the third term is -84 s / sqrt(30).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n480 = 4s\u00b2 - 16s*sqrt(30) + 480 - (156 s)/sqrt(30) - (84 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n480 = 4s\u00b2 - 16s*sqrt(30) + 480 - [156 + 84] s / sqrt(30).\n\nSo, 480 = 4s\u00b2 - 16s*sqrt(30) + 480 - (240 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nNow, subtract 480 from both sides:\n\n0 = 4s\u00b2 - 16s*sqrt(30) - (240 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nFactor out s:\n\n0 = 4s\u00b2 - s*(16*sqrt(30) + 240/sqrt(30)).\n\nLet me compute 16*sqrt(30) + 240/sqrt(30):\n\nCompute each term:\n\n16*sqrt(30) = 16*sqrt(30).\n\n240/sqrt(30) = (240*sqrt(30))/30 = 8*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, 16*sqrt(30) + 8*sqrt(30) = 24*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n0 = 4s\u00b2 - s*(24*sqrt(30)).\n\nFactor out 4s:\n\n0 = 4s(s - 6*sqrt(30)).\n\nSo, either 4s = 0 \u2192 s=0 (impossible) or s - 6*sqrt(30) = 0 \u2192 s = 6*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s = 6*sqrt(30).\n\nNow that I have s, I can find bc from equation 1:\n\nbc = (78 s)/sqrt(30) = (78 * 6*sqrt(30)) / sqrt(30) )= 78 *6 * (sqrt(30)/sqrt(30)) )= 78 *6 *1 = 468.\n\nSo, bc = 468. Therefore, AB*AC = c*b = 468.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward now. Let me just verify the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the Law of Cosines equation and substituting all the known values, I eventually found that s = 6*sqrt(30). Then, using bc = (78 s)/sqrt(30), I substituted s and got bc = 468. So, the product AB*AC is 468.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the circumradius \\( R = 13 \\) and the inradius \\( r = 6 \\). The condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) implies that triangle \\( IAO \\) is a right triangle at \\( I \\). Using the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter, we find \\( OI = \\sqrt{R(R - 2r)} = \\sqrt{13(13 - 12)} = \\sqrt{13} \\).\n\nIn the right triangle \\( IAO \\), by the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[\nOA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \\implies 13^2 = (\\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \\implies IA = \\sqrt{169 - 13} = \\sqrt{156} = 2\\sqrt{39}.\n\\]\n\nThe length \\( IA \\) can also be expressed as \\( IA = \\frac{r}{\\sin(A/2)} \\). Substituting \\( IA = 2\\sqrt{39} \\) and \\( r = 6 \\), we get:\n\\[\n2\\sqrt{39} = \\frac{6}{\\sin(A/2)} \\implies \\sin(A/2) = \\frac{6}{2\\sqrt{39}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{39}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the double-angle identity for cosine:\n\\[\n\\cos A = 1 - 2\\sin^2(A/2) = 1 - 2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{78}{169} = \\frac{91}{169}.\n\\]\n\nThe area \\( \\Delta \\) of the triangle can be expressed as \\( \\Delta = r \\cdot s = 6s \\), where \\( s \\) is the semi-perimeter. Using the Law of Sines, the side \\( a \\) opposite angle \\( A \\) is:\n\\[\na = 2R \\sin A = 26 \\cdot \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13} = 4\\sqrt{30}.\n\\]\n\nFrom the Law of Cosines:\n\\[\na^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A \\implies 480 = b^2 + c^2 - \\frac{182}{169}bc.\n\\]\n\nWe also know:\n\\[\n\\Delta = \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A = 6s \\implies \\frac{1}{2}bc \\cdot \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13} = 6s \\implies bc = \\frac{78s}{\\sqrt{30}}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( s = \\frac{a + b + c}{2} \\) and solving the system of equations, we find \\( s = 6\\sqrt{30} \\). Substituting \\( s \\) back, we get:\n\\[\nbc = \\frac{78 \\cdot 6\\sqrt{30}}{\\sqrt{30}} = 468.\n\\]\n\nThus, the product \\( AB \\cdot AC = bc = 468 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{468}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem about triangle ABC. The problem states that the triangle has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is given as 13, and the inradius is 6. The goal is to find the product AB multiplied by AC, which is AB\u00b7AC.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the circumcenter and incenter are. The circumcenter O is the center of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and it's the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle's sides. The incenter I is the center of the inscribed circle, which is tangent to all three sides of the triangle, and it's the intersection of the angle bisectors.\n\nThe problem says that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle ABC, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the circumcenter O to the incenter I. That seems like an important condition that might relate some of the triangle's properties.\n\nGiven that the circumradius R is 13, I remember that the formula for the circumradius is R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle and \u0394 is the area. But I don't know the sides yet, so maybe that's not the immediate way to go.\n\nThe inradius r is given as 6. The formula for the inradius is r = \u0394/s, where s is the semiperimeter. So if I can find \u0394 and s, maybe I can find some relation.\n\nWait, maybe I should start by using the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, that means the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. But I'm not sure how to translate that into equations without coordinates. Maybe coordinate geometry could be helpful here.\n\nLet me consider setting up a coordinate system. Let me place point I at the origin (0,0) to simplify calculations. Then, the line OI would be the line from the incenter I (0,0) to the circumcenter O. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and A is a vertex of the triangle, the vector IA is perpendicular to the vector OI.\n\nWait, but if I is at (0,0), then point A is somewhere on the plane, and point O is another point. So, the vector IA is just the vector from I to A, which is the coordinates of A. The vector OI would be from O to I, which is (-O_x, -O_y). So, their dot product should be zero.\n\nWait, actually, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then the vector IA is perpendicular to the vector OI. So, (A - I) \u00b7 (O - I) = 0. Since I is at (0,0), this simplifies to A \u00b7 O = 0. So, the coordinates of A and O must satisfy A \u00b7 O = 0. That's a useful condition.\n\nBut without knowing the coordinates of O, maybe this is too abstract. Maybe I should think about some properties or formulas that relate R, r, and other elements like sides, semiperimeter, etc.\n\nI remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r)\n\nWhere R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me check if I remember this correctly. Yes, that's a standard formula. So, plugging in R =13 and r=6:\n\nOI\u00b2 = 13*(13 - 12) =13*1=13.\n\nSo OI = sqrt(13). That's the distance between O and I.\n\nWait, but in the problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle IAO is a right-angled triangle with right angle at A. So, in triangle IAO, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, by the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nIA\u00b2 + AI\u00b2 = OI\u00b2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, IA is one leg, and AI is another? Wait, that can't be. Let me think.\n\nWait, IA is the vector from I to A, which is a line segment. OI is the vector from O to I. Wait, no, the condition is that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, IA and OI are perpendicular vectors. So, the triangle IAO has sides IA, AO, and IO, with IA perpendicular to IO.\n\nWait, no, in the triangle IAO, sides are IA, AO, and IO. The right angle is at A because IA is perpendicular to IO. So, triangle IAO is right-angled at A.\n\nSo, according to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nIA\u00b2 + AO\u00b2 = IO\u00b2.\n\nWait, but wait, IO is the distance between I and O, which we already found as sqrt(13). So, IO\u00b2 is 13. So,\n\nIA\u00b2 + AO\u00b2 = 13.\n\nBut I don't know IA or AO. Hmm.\n\nBut maybe I can express IA and AO in terms of other triangle properties.\n\nI recall that IA can be expressed in terms of the triangle's angles. The length of the inradius is r, but IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. There's a formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex.\n\nI think the formula is IA = r / sin(A/2), where A is the angle at vertex A. Similarly, IB = r / sin(B/2), and IC = r / sin(C/2). Let me verify that.\n\nYes, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is indeed IA = r / sin(A/2). So, IA = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nSimilarly, AO is the distance from the circumcenter O to vertex A, which is simply the circumradius R. Wait, because in any triangle, the distance from the circumcenter to a vertex is R. So, AO = R =13.\n\nWait, that's right! Because O is the circumradius, so OA = OB = OC = R =13.\n\nSo, AO is 13. So, in the equation IA\u00b2 + AO\u00b2 = IO\u00b2, we have:\n\n(6 / sin(A/2))\u00b2 + 13\u00b2 = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 =13.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 13\u00b2 is 169, which is way larger than 13. So, that equation would be (36)/(sin\u00b2(A/2)) + 169 =13, which would imply (36)/(sin\u00b2(A/2)) = -156, which is impossible. So, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Hold on. If triangle IAO is right-angled at A, then IA\u00b2 + AO\u00b2 = IO\u00b2.\n\nWait, but AO is 13, and IO is sqrt(13). So, 13\u00b2 is 169, which is bigger than IO\u00b2=13, so 169 + IA\u00b2 =13, which would mean IA\u00b2 is negative, which is impossible. So, I must have messed up the triangle.\n\nWait, perhaps the right angle is not at A, but somewhere else? Let me think again.\n\nThe problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line IA is perpendicular to the line OI. So, the lines IA and OI intersect at point I and are perpendicular. So, the triangle IAO is right-angled at I. Because IA is perpendicular to OI, their intersection is at I. So, the right angle is at I, not at A.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, triangle IAO is right-angled at I, so:\n\nIA\u00b2 + IO\u00b2 = AO\u00b2.\n\nAh, that's better. So, IA\u00b2 + IO\u00b2 = AO\u00b2.\n\nWe know AO is the circumradius R=13, so AO\u00b2=169.\n\nIO is the distance between incenter and circumradius, which we found earlier as sqrt(13), so IO\u00b2=13.\n\nIA is the distance from inradius to vertex A, which is IA = r / sin(A/2) =6 / sin(A/2).\n\nSo, plugging into the equation:\n\n(6 / sin(A/2))\u00b2 +13 =169.\n\nSo,\n\n36 / sin\u00b2(A/2) =169 -13 =156.\n\nSo,\n\nsin\u00b2(A/2)=36 /156 = 3/13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2)=sqrt(3/13). Therefore, cos(A/2)=sqrt(1 -3/13)=sqrt(10/13).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I need to compute this. Maybe I can find other relations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the distance between incenter and circumradius: OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). So, that's how we got OI\u00b2=13.\n\nWait, but maybe another approach is needed here. Let me think about other triangle properties.\n\nI know that the product AB\u00b7AC can be expressed in terms of the sides. Let me denote AB=c, BC=a, and AC=b. So, the sides opposite angles A, B, C are a, b, c respectively.\n\nWait, no, actually, in standard notation, side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, and side c opposite angle C.\n\nWait, but in triangle ABC, vertex A is opposite side a, which is BC. So, AB is side c, AC is side b.\n\nSo, the product AB\u00b7AC is c\u00b7b.\n\nSo, I need to find bc.\n\nHmm.\n\nI also know that in any triangle, the area \u0394 can be expressed as r*s, where s is the semiperimeter, and also as (a*b*c)/(4R).\n\nSo, let me write that:\n\n\u0394 = r*s = (a*b*c)/(4R).\n\nSo, since r=6, R=13,\n\n6s = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo,\n\na*b*c = 6s *52 = 312 s.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut I don't know a, b, c, or s. So, maybe that's not helpful yet.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use other formulas. Let's think about the formula involving the inradius and the exradius. Or maybe some trigonometric identities.\n\nWait, since I found sin\u00b2(A/2)=3/13, I can find cos A using the double-angle formula.\n\nBecause cos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) =1 - 2*(3/13)=1 -6/13=7/13.\n\nSo, cos A=7/13.\n\nAlso, in a triangle, the Law of Cosines relates the sides with the cosine of an angle:\n\ncos A = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2)/(2bc).\n\nBut I don't know a, b, or c. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, I can relate this to the formula for the area. The area \u0394 can also be expressed as (1/2)bc sin A.\n\nSince cos A=7/13, sin A= sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2)=sqrt(1 -49/169)=sqrt(120/169)= (2*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, sin A= (2 sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, \u0394= (1/2) bc sin A = (1/2)* bc*(2 sqrt(30)/13) )= (bc sqrt(30))/13.\n\nBut I also know that \u0394= r*s=6s.\n\nSo, 6s= (bc sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo,\n\nbc= (6s *13)/sqrt(30)= (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, but I still don't know s.\n\nWait, but s is (a + b + c)/2. So, s= (a + b + c)/2.\n\nI need another equation to relate these variables.\n\nWait, let's think about the formula for the distance from the inradius to the vertex. We had IA=6 / sin(A/2). We found sin(A/2)=sqrt(3/13), so IA=6 / sqrt(3/13)=6 * sqrt(13/3)=6 sqrt(13)/sqrt(3)=2 sqrt(39).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me compute that again.\n\nsin(A/2)=sqrt(3/13), so IA=6 / sin(A/2)=6 / sqrt(3/13)=6 * sqrt(13/3)=6 sqrt(13)/sqrt(3)= (6 sqrt(39))/3=2 sqrt(39). Yes, that's right. So, IA=2 sqrt(39).\n\nBut IA is also the distance from the inradius to vertex A. Is there another way to express IA?\n\nAlternatively, in a triangle, the length of the angle bisector can be expressed in terms of the sides. But IA is not the angle bisector; it's the distance from the inradius to the vertex. Wait, but perhaps I can relate IA with the sides.\n\nWait, perhaps using coordinates. Let me try to model the triangle with some coordinate system.\n\nWait, earlier I thought of placing I at (0,0). Let me try that. So, I is at (0,0), and O is somewhere else. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), then the vector IA is perpendicular to the vector OI.\n\nWait, but vector IA is from I to A, which is just the coordinates of A. Vector OI is from O to I, which is (-Ox, -Oy). So, their dot product is zero:\n\nA \u00b7 (-O) =0 => A \u00b7 O =0.\n\nSo, the coordinates of A and O satisfy A_x * O_x + A_y * O_y =0.\n\nHmm, but without knowing the coordinates, it's hard to proceed. Maybe I can consider another approach.\n\nWait, I know that in triangle ABC, the inradius is 6, and the circumradius is 13. Also, we found cos A=7/13.\n\nI also remember that in any triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA= (r)/sin(A/2). We already used that.\n\nWait, but maybe I can use the formula for the length of the median or something else. Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities in triangle IAO.\n\nWait, triangle IAO is right-angled at I, so we can use trigonometric relations.\n\nWait, in triangle IAO, right-angled at I, so:\n\ntan(theta) = opposite / adjacent.\n\nWhere theta is angle at I, which is angle IAO. Wait, but maybe it's better to think in terms of sides.\n\nWait, IA=2 sqrt(39), IO= sqrt(13), and AO=13.\n\nWait, but in a right-angled triangle, the sides satisfy IA\u00b2 + IO\u00b2 = AO\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n(2 sqrt(39))\u00b2 + (sqrt(13))\u00b2 = 4*39 +13=156 +13=169=13\u00b2. Yes, that works. So, the earlier calculation is correct.\n\nSo, that's a good consistency check.\n\nBut how does this help me find AB\u00b7AC?\n\nWait, perhaps I can relate the sides using the Law of Sines.\n\nIn the Law of Sines, a/sin A = 2R. So, a=2R sin A=2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13)= 2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13)= 4 sqrt(30).\n\nWait, let me compute that again.\n\nLaw of Sines: a / sin A = 2R.\n\nSo, a = 2R sin A.\n\nWe have R=13, sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo,\n\na=2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13)= 2*2 sqrt(30)=4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, side a=BC=4 sqrt(30).\n\nOkay, so we have side a.\n\nNow, let's see. The semiperimeter s=(a + b + c)/2.\n\nWe also know that area \u0394= r*s=6s.\n\nAnd \u0394 is also equal to (1/2)ab sin C, but maybe that's not helpful.\n\nWait, another formula: in any triangle, the product of the lengths of two sides is equal to 2R times the product of the inradius and the semiperimeter minus the third side. Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the formula that relates the inradius, semiperimeter, and sides.\n\nWe have r=\u0394/s, so \u0394= r*s.\n\nAlso, \u0394= (a*b*c)/(4R).\n\nSo, 6s= (a*b*c)/(4*13)= (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, a*b*c=6s *52=312s.\n\nWe know a=4 sqrt(30). So,\n\n4 sqrt(30) * b * c=312 s.\n\nSo, b*c= (312 s)/(4 sqrt(30))= (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nBut we also have another expression for bc.\n\nEarlier, from \u0394= (1/2) bc sin A=6s,\n\nSo,\n\n(1/2) bc sin A=6s.\n\nWe have sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13,\n\nSo,\n\n(1/2) bc*(2 sqrt(30)/13)=6s.\n\nSimplify:\n\nbc*(sqrt(30)/13)=6s.\n\nSo,\n\nbc= (6s *13)/sqrt(30)= (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nWhich matches the earlier expression for bc. So, that's consistent.\n\nBut I still don't know s.\n\nWait, but maybe I can express s in terms of a, b, c.\n\nWe have s=(a + b + c)/2.\n\nWe know a=4 sqrt(30). So, s= (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, if I can find another equation involving b and c, perhaps I can solve for bc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula that relates the inradius, semiperimeter, and the distances from the inradius to the vertices.\n\nWait, but I don't recall such a formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in triangle ABC, the distance from the inradius to vertex A is IA=2 sqrt(39).\n\nWait, I found IA=2 sqrt(39). Maybe I can express IA in terms of the sides.\n\nI recall that the distance from the inradius to vertex A can be expressed as IA= sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nYes, I think so. Because in a triangle, the inradius is at a distance of r from each side, and the ex-spheres are at distances related to s.\n\nWait, more accurately, the formula for the length of the internal angle bisector can be complicated, but the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA= sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nLet me verify this formula.\n\nYes, according to some geometry references, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2.\n\nWe have IA=2 sqrt(39), so IA\u00b2=4*39=156.\n\nSo,\n\n156 = r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2.\n\nGiven that r=6, a=4 sqrt(30),\n\nSo,\n\n156=36 + (s -4 sqrt(30))\u00b2.\n\nSubtract 36:\n\n120= (s -4 sqrt(30))\u00b2.\n\nTake square roots:\n\ns -4 sqrt(30)= sqrt(120)=2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo,\n\ns=4 sqrt(30) +2 sqrt(30)=6 sqrt(30).\n\nAlternatively, could it be negative? Since s is a length, it must be positive. So, s=6 sqrt(30).\n\nWait, but s is the semiperimeter, so s=(a + b + c)/2=6 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, the perimeter is 12 sqrt(30).\n\nWe already have a=4 sqrt(30), so b + c=12 sqrt(30) -4 sqrt(30)=8 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, b + c=8 sqrt(30).\n\nEarlier, we had bc= (78 s)/sqrt(30)= (78 *6 sqrt(30))/sqrt(30)=78*6=468.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward.\n\nWait, let me compute bc.\n\nWe have bc=78 s / sqrt(30).\n\nBut s=6 sqrt(30), so:\n\nbc=78 *6 sqrt(30) / sqrt(30)=78*6=468.\n\nBecause sqrt(30) cancels out.\n\nSo, bc=468.\n\nTherefore, AB\u00b7AC= c\u00b7b=468.\n\nSo, the product AB\u00b7AC is 468.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem about triangle ABC. The problem states that the triangle has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is given as 13, and the inradius is 6. The goal is to find the product AB multiplied by AC, which is AB\u00b7AC.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the circumcenter and incenter are. The circumcenter O is the center of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and it's the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle's sides. The incenter I is the center of the inscribed circle, which is tangent to all three sides of the triangle, and it's the intersection of the angle bisectors.\n\nThe problem says that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle ABC, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the circumcenter O to the incenter I. That seems like an important condition that might relate some of the triangle's properties.\n\nGiven that the circumradius R is 13, I remember that the formula for the circumradius is R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle and \u0394 is the area. But I don't know the sides yet, so maybe that's not the immediate way to go.\n\nThe inradius r is given as 6. The formula for the inradius is r = \u0394/s, where s is the semiperimeter. So if I can find \u0394 and s, maybe I can find some relation.\n\nWait, maybe I should start by using the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, that means the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. But I'm not sure how to translate that into equations without coordinates. Maybe coordinate geometry could be helpful here.\n\nLet me consider setting up a coordinate system. Let me place point I at the origin (0,0) to simplify calculations. Then, the line OI would be the line from the incenter I (0,0) to the circumcenter O. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and A is a vertex of the triangle, the vector IA is perpendicular to the vector OI.\n\nWait, but if I is at (0,0), then point A is somewhere on the plane, and point O is another point. So, the vector IA is just the vector from I to A, which is the coordinates of A. The vector OI would be from O to I, which is (-O_x, -O_y). So, their dot product should be zero.\n\nWait, actually, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then the vector IA is perpendicular to the vector OI. So, (A - I) \u00b7 (O - I) = 0. Since I is at (0,0), this simplifies to A \u00b7 O = 0. So, the coordinates of A and O must satisfy A \u00b7 O = 0. That's a useful condition.\n\nBut without knowing the coordinates of O, maybe this is too abstract. Maybe I should think about some properties or formulas that relate R, r, and other elements like sides, semiperimeter, etc.\n\nI remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r)\n\nWhere R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me check if I remember this correctly. Yes, that's a standard formula. So, plugging in R =13 and r=6:\n\nOI\u00b2 = 13*(13 - 12) =13*1=13.\n\nSo OI = sqrt(13). That's the distance between O and I.\n\nWait, but in the problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle IAO is a right-angled triangle with right angle at A. So, in triangle IAO, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, by the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nIA\u00b2 + AI\u00b2 = OI\u00b2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, IA is one leg, and AI is another? Wait, that can't be. Let me think.\n\nWait, IA is the vector from I to A, which is a line segment. OI is the vector from O to I. Wait, no, the condition is that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, IA and OI are perpendicular vectors. So, the triangle IAO has sides IA, AO, and IO, with IA perpendicular to IO.\n\nWait, no, in the triangle IAO, sides are IA, AO, and IO. The right angle is at A because IA is perpendicular to IO. So, triangle IAO is right-angled at A.\n\nSo, according to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nIA\u00b2 + AO\u00b2 = IO\u00b2.\n\nWait, but wait, IO is the distance between I and O, which we already found as sqrt(13). So, IO\u00b2 is 13. So,\n\nIA\u00b2 + AO\u00b2 = 13.\n\nBut I don't know IA or AO. Hmm.\n\nBut maybe I can express IA and AO in terms of other triangle properties.\n\nI recall that IA can be expressed in terms of the triangle's angles. The length of the inradius is r, but IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. There's a formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex.\n\nI think the formula is IA = r / sin(A/2), where A is the angle at vertex A. Similarly, IB = r / sin(B/2), and IC = r / sin(C/2). Let me verify that.\n\nYes, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is indeed IA = r / sin(A/2). So, IA = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nSimilarly, AO is the distance from the circumcenter O to vertex A, which is simply the circumradius R. Wait, because in any triangle, the distance from the circumcenter to a vertex is R. So, AO = R =13.\n\nWait, that's right! Because O is the circumradius, so OA = OB = OC = R =13.\n\nSo, AO is 13. So, in the equation IA\u00b2 + AO\u00b2 = IO\u00b2, we have:\n\n(6 / sin(A/2))\u00b2 + 13\u00b2 = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 =13.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 13\u00b2 is 169, which is way larger than 13. So, that equation would be (36)/(sin\u00b2(A/2)) + 169 =13, which would imply (36)/(sin\u00b2(A/2)) = -156, which is impossible. So, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Hold on. If triangle IAO is right-angled at A, then IA\u00b2 + AO\u00b2 = IO\u00b2.\n\nWait, but AO is 13, and IO is sqrt(13). So, 13\u00b2 is 169, which is bigger than IO\u00b2=13, so 169 + IA\u00b2 =13, which would mean IA\u00b2 is negative, which is impossible. So, I must have messed up the triangle.\n\nWait, perhaps the right angle is not at A, but somewhere else? Let me think again.\n\nThe problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line IA is perpendicular to the line OI. So, the lines IA and OI intersect at point I and are perpendicular. So, the triangle IAO is right-angled at I. Because IA is perpendicular to OI, their intersection is at I. So, the right angle is at I, not at A.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, triangle IAO is right-angled at I, so:\n\nIA\u00b2 + IO\u00b2 = AO\u00b2.\n\nAh, that's better. So, IA\u00b2 + IO\u00b2 = AO\u00b2.\n\nWe know AO is the circumradius R=13, so AO\u00b2=169.\n\nIO is the distance between incenter and circumradius, which we found earlier as sqrt(13), so IO\u00b2=13.\n\nIA is the distance from inradius to vertex A, which is IA = r / sin(A/2) =6 / sin(A/2).\n\nSo, plugging into the equation:\n\n(6 / sin(A/2))\u00b2 +13 =169.\n\nSo,\n\n36 / sin\u00b2(A/2) =169 -13 =156.\n\nSo,\n\nsin\u00b2(A/2)=36 /156 = 3/13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2)=sqrt(3/13). Therefore, cos(A/2)=sqrt(1 -3/13)=sqrt(10/13).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I need to compute this. Maybe I can find other relations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the distance between incenter and circumradius: OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). So, that's how we got OI\u00b2=13.\n\nWait, but maybe another approach is needed here. Let me think about other triangle properties.\n\nI know that the product AB\u00b7AC can be expressed in terms of the sides. Let me denote AB=c, BC=a, and AC=b. So, the sides opposite angles A, B, C are a, b, c respectively.\n\nWait, no, actually, in standard notation, side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, and side c opposite angle C.\n\nWait, but in triangle ABC, vertex A is opposite side a, which is BC. So, AB is side c, AC is side b.\n\nSo, the product AB\u00b7AC is c\u00b7b.\n\nSo, I need to find bc.\n\nHmm.\n\nI also know that in any triangle, the area \u0394 can be expressed as r*s, where s is the semiperimeter, and also as (a*b*c)/(4R).\n\nSo, let me write that:\n\n\u0394 = r*s = (a*b*c)/(4R).\n\nSo, since r=6, R=13,\n\n6s = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo,\n\na*b*c = 6s *52 = 312 s.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut I don't know a, b, c, or s. So, maybe that's not helpful yet.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use other formulas. Let's think about the formula involving the inradius and the exradius. Or maybe some trigonometric identities.\n\nWait, since I found sin\u00b2(A/2)=3/13, I can find cos A using the double-angle formula.\n\nBecause cos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) =1 - 2*(3/13)=1 -6/13=7/13.\n\nSo, cos A=7/13.\n\nAlso, in a triangle, the Law of Cosines relates the sides with the cosine of an angle:\n\ncos A = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2)/(2bc).\n\nBut I don't know a, b, or c. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, I can relate this to the formula for the area. The area \u0394 can also be expressed as (1/2)bc sin A.\n\nSince cos A=7/13, sin A= sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2)=sqrt(1 -49/169)=sqrt(120/169)= (2*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, sin A= (2 sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, \u0394= (1/2) bc sin A = (1/2)* bc*(2 sqrt(30)/13) )= (bc sqrt(30))/13.\n\nBut I also know that \u0394= r*s=6s.\n\nSo, 6s= (bc sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo,\n\nbc= (6s *13)/sqrt(30)= (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, but I still don't know s.\n\nWait, but s is (a + b + c)/2. So, s= (a + b + c)/2.\n\nI need another equation to relate these variables.\n\nWait, let's think about the formula for the distance from the inradius to the vertex. We had IA=6 / sin(A/2). We found sin(A/2)=sqrt(3/13), so IA=6 / sqrt(3/13)=6 * sqrt(13/3)=6 sqrt(13)/sqrt(3)=2 sqrt(39).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me compute that again.\n\nsin(A/2)=sqrt(3/13), so IA=6 / sin(A/2)=6 / sqrt(3/13)=6 * sqrt(13/3)=6 sqrt(13)/sqrt(3)= (6 sqrt(39))/3=2 sqrt(39). Yes, that's right. So, IA=2 sqrt(39).\n\nBut IA is also the distance from the inradius to vertex A. Is there another way to express IA?\n\nAlternatively, in a triangle, the length of the angle bisector can be expressed in terms of the sides. But IA is not the angle bisector; it's the distance from the inradius to the vertex. Wait, but perhaps I can relate IA with the sides.\n\nWait, perhaps using coordinates. Let me try to model the triangle with some coordinate system.\n\nWait, earlier I thought of placing I at (0,0). Let me try that. So, I is at (0,0), and O is somewhere else. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), then the vector IA is perpendicular to the vector OI.\n\nWait, but vector IA is from I to A, which is just the coordinates of A. Vector OI is from O to I, which is (-Ox, -Oy). So, their dot product is zero:\n\nA \u00b7 (-O) =0 => A \u00b7 O =0.\n\nSo, the coordinates of A and O satisfy A_x * O_x + A_y * O_y =0.\n\nHmm, but without knowing the coordinates, it's hard to proceed. Maybe I can consider another approach.\n\nWait, I know that in triangle ABC, the inradius is 6, and the circumradius is 13. Also, we found cos A=7/13.\n\nI also remember that in any triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA= (r)/sin(A/2). We already used that.\n\nWait, but maybe I can use the formula for the length of the median or something else. Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities in triangle IAO.\n\nWait, triangle IAO is right-angled at I, so we can use trigonometric relations.\n\nWait, in triangle IAO, right-angled at I, so:\n\ntan(theta) = opposite / adjacent.\n\nWhere theta is angle at I, which is angle IAO. Wait, but maybe it's better to think in terms of sides.\n\nWait, IA=2 sqrt(39), IO= sqrt(13), and AO=13.\n\nWait, but in a right-angled triangle, the sides satisfy IA\u00b2 + IO\u00b2 = AO\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n(2 sqrt(39))\u00b2 + (sqrt(13))\u00b2 = 4*39 +13=156 +13=169=13\u00b2. Yes, that works. So, the earlier calculation is correct.\n\nSo, that's a good consistency check.\n\nBut how does this help me find AB\u00b7AC?\n\nWait, perhaps I can relate the sides using the Law of Sines.\n\nIn the Law of Sines, a/sin A = 2R. So, a=2R sin A=2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13)= 2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13)= 4 sqrt(30).\n\nWait, let me compute that again.\n\nLaw of Sines: a / sin A = 2R.\n\nSo, a = 2R sin A.\n\nWe have R=13, sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo,\n\na=2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13)= 2*2 sqrt(30)=4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, side a=BC=4 sqrt(30).\n\nOkay, so we have side a.\n\nNow, let's see. The semiperimeter s=(a + b + c)/2.\n\nWe also know that area \u0394= r*s=6s.\n\nAnd \u0394 is also equal to (1/2)ab sin C, but maybe that's not helpful.\n\nWait, another formula: in any triangle, the product of the lengths of two sides is equal to 2R times the product of the inradius and the semiperimeter minus the third side. Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the formula that relates the inradius, semiperimeter, and sides.\n\nWe have r=\u0394/s, so \u0394= r*s.\n\nAlso, \u0394= (a*b*c)/(4R).\n\nSo, 6s= (a*b*c)/(4*13)= (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, a*b*c=6s *52=312s.\n\nWe know a=4 sqrt(30). So,\n\n4 sqrt(30) * b * c=312 s.\n\nSo, b*c= (312 s)/(4 sqrt(30))= (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nBut we also have another expression for bc.\n\nEarlier, from \u0394= (1/2) bc sin A=6s,\n\nSo,\n\n(1/2) bc sin A=6s.\n\nWe have sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13,\n\nSo,\n\n(1/2) bc*(2 sqrt(30)/13)=6s.\n\nSimplify:\n\nbc*(sqrt(30)/13)=6s.\n\nSo,\n\nbc= (6s *13)/sqrt(30)= (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nWhich matches the earlier expression for bc. So, that's consistent.\n\nBut I still don't know s.\n\nWait, but maybe I can express s in terms of a, b, c.\n\nWe have s=(a + b + c)/2.\n\nWe know a=4 sqrt(30). So, s= (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, if I can find another equation involving b and c, perhaps I can solve for bc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula that relates the inradius, semiperimeter, and the distances from the inradius to the vertices.\n\nWait, but I don't recall such a formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in triangle ABC, the distance from the inradius to vertex A is IA=2 sqrt(39).\n\nWait, I found IA=2 sqrt(39). Maybe I can express IA in terms of the sides.\n\nI recall that the distance from the inradius to vertex A can be expressed as IA= sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nYes, I think so. Because in a triangle, the inradius is at a distance of r from each side, and the ex-spheres are at distances related to s.\n\nWait, more accurately, the formula for the length of the internal angle bisector can be complicated, but the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA= sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nLet me verify this formula.\n\nYes, according to some geometry references, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2.\n\nWe have IA=2 sqrt(39), so IA\u00b2=4*39=156.\n\nSo,\n\n156 = r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2.\n\nGiven that r=6, a=4 sqrt(30),\n\nSo,\n\n156=36 + (s -4 sqrt(30))\u00b2.\n\nSubtract 36:\n\n120= (s -4 sqrt(30))\u00b2.\n\nTake square roots:\n\ns -4 sqrt(30)= sqrt(120)=2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo,\n\ns=4 sqrt(30) +2 sqrt(30)=6 sqrt(30).\n\nAlternatively, could it be negative? Since s is a length, it must be positive. So, s=6 sqrt(30).\n\nWait, but s is the semiperimeter, so s=(a + b + c)/2=6 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, the perimeter is 12 sqrt(30).\n\nWe already have a=4 sqrt(30), so b + c=12 sqrt(30) -4 sqrt(30)=8 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, b + c=8 sqrt(30).\n\nEarlier, we had bc= (78 s)/sqrt(30)= (78 *6 sqrt(30))/sqrt(30)=78*6=468.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward.\n\nWait, let me compute bc.\n\nWe have bc=78 s / sqrt(30).\n\nBut s=6 sqrt(30), so:\n\nbc=78 *6 sqrt(30) / sqrt(30)=78*6=468.\n\nBecause sqrt(30) cancels out.\n\nSo, bc=468.\n\nTherefore, AB\u00b7AC= c\u00b7b=468.\n\nSo, the product AB\u00b7AC is 468.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the circumradius \\( R = 13 \\) and the inradius \\( r = 6 \\). The condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) implies that triangle \\( IAO \\) is right-angled at \\( I \\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n\\[\nIA^2 + IO^2 = AO^2\n\\]\n\nWe know \\( AO = R = 13 \\) and \\( IO \\) can be found using the formula \\( OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \\):\n\n\\[\nOI^2 = 13(13 - 12) = 13\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( IO = \\sqrt{13} \\). Substituting into the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\nIA^2 + 13 = 13^2 \\implies IA^2 + 13 = 169 \\implies IA^2 = 156 \\implies IA = \\sqrt{156} = 2\\sqrt{39}\n\\]\n\nThe distance from the incenter to vertex \\( A \\) is given by \\( IA = \\frac{r}{\\sin(A/2)} \\). Solving for \\( \\sin(A/2) \\):\n\n\\[\n2\\sqrt{39} = \\frac{6}{\\sin(A/2)} \\implies \\sin(A/2) = \\frac{6}{2\\sqrt{39}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{39}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{13}}\n\\]\n\nUsing the double-angle identity for cosine:\n\n\\[\n\\cos A = 1 - 2\\sin^2(A/2) = 1 - 2\\left(\\frac{3}{13}\\right) = \\frac{7}{13}\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the Law of Cosines to find side \\( a \\) (opposite angle \\( A \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\cos A = \\frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc} \\implies \\frac{7}{13} = \\frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}\n\\]\n\nWe also know the area \\( \\Delta \\) can be expressed as \\( \\Delta = r \\cdot s \\) and \\( \\Delta = \\frac{abc}{4R} \\), where \\( s \\) is the semiperimeter.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again.\n\nWe have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It says that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB\u00b7AC.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's try to visualize the triangle. So, triangle ABC with circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6. IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important.\n\nFirst, I remember that the circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle by the formula a/(2 sin A) = R, where a is the length opposite angle A. Similarly, the inradius r is related by the formula r = \u0394/s, where \u0394 is the area and s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. Since we have both R and r, perhaps we can find some relation between them. Also, the condition IA perpendicular to OI might be key here.\n\nLet me recall some properties. The incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors. In some cases, like in an equilateral triangle, O and I coincide, but here they're different since IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nI think there's a formula that relates R, r, and the distance between O and I. Oh right! The formula is OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me verify. I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Hmm, no, wait: OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So that would make OI = sqrt(R\u00b2 - 2Rr). Let's compute that.\n\nGiven R = 13 and r = 6, so OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13). Hmm, okay.\n\nNow, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, IA \u22a5 OI. That must mean that triangle IOA is a right-angled triangle at I.\n\nWait, let me think. Point I is the incenter. So, IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. Hmm, in a triangle, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side, but IA is the distance from I to vertex A, which is not necessarily equal to r.\n\nWait, so IA is the length of the segment from I to A, which is different from the inradius. The inradius is the distance from I to each side, like IB or IC, but IA is a different length.\n\nSo, in triangle IOA, which is right-angled at I, we have sides OI, IA, and OA. We know OI is sqrt(13), OA is the circumradius, which is 13, and IA is the distance from incenter to A.\n\nSo, in triangle IOA, by Pythagoras: (IA)\u00b2 + (OI)\u00b2 = (OA)\u00b2.\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 + (sqrt(13))\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 => IA\u00b2 + 13 = 169 => IA\u00b2 = 156 => IA = sqrt(156). Let me simplify that: sqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nOkay, so IA = 2\u221a39. Now, what can I do with this information?\n\nI recall that in a triangle, the length of the inradius can be related to the area and semi-perimeter. Also, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides.\n\nWait, there's a formula for the length of IA. Let me recall it. I think it's IA = r / sin(A/2). Is that correct?\n\nYes, I think so. Because in the inradius, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed as IA = r / sin(A/2). Let me confirm this.\n\nIn triangle ABC, the inradius r is related to the angles. The distance from I to A is IA = r / sin(A/2). So, that's correct.\n\nSo, IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2) = 2\u221a39.\n\nSo, 6 / sin(A/2) = 2\u221a39. Let me solve for sin(A/2).\n\nsin(A/2) = 6 / (2\u221a39) = 3 / \u221a39 = (3\u221a39) / 39 = \u221a39 / 13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = \u221a39 / 13.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, from this, I can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin\u00b2x + cos\u00b2x = 1.\n\nSo, cos\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169 => cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nNow, what else can I find? Hmm, perhaps the sides of the triangle. Let me think about the formula for the sides in terms of R and the angles.\n\nWe know that a = 2R sin A. Similarly, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.\n\nWait, but in this case, we're interested in AB and AC, which are sides opposite to angles C and B, respectively. Wait, let's clarify.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, side opposite angle A is BC, denoted as a; side opposite angle B is AC, denoted as b; and side opposite angle C is AB, denoted as c.\n\nSo, AB is side c, and AC is side b. So, AB\u00b7AC = c\u00b7b.\n\nSo, we need to find the product c\u00b7b.\n\nHmm. Let's see. So, since we have expressions for sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), perhaps we can find angle A, and then find the sides.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can relate this to other triangle properties.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the product of the sides can be related to the area. Also, the area can be expressed in terms of inradius and semi-perimeter: \u0394 = r\u00b7s, where s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed as \u0394 = (a b c) / (4R). Hmm, but that might not be directly helpful here.\n\nWait, let's think about the formula for the area in terms of sine. The area \u0394 = (1/2)ab sin C, but perhaps that's not directly helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, since we know sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), we can find sin A and cos A.\n\nUsing double-angle identities:\n\nsin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(\u221a39/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = 2*(\u221a(39*130))/169.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 39 * 130 = 39 * 13 * 10 = 507 * 10 = 5070. So, sqrt(5070).\n\nWait, let me factor 5070 to see if it can be simplified.\n\n5070 = 10 * 507 = 10 * 3 * 169 = 10 * 3 * 13\u00b2. So, sqrt(5070) = sqrt(10*3*13\u00b2) = 13*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, sin A = 2*(13*sqrt(30))/169 = (26 sqrt(30))/169 = (2 sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSimilarly, cos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 -78)/169 = 91/169 = 7*13 / (13\u00b2) ) = 7/13.\n\nWait, no: 169 -78 is 91, so 91/169. Simplifying, 91 =13*7, so 91/169 = 7/13.\n\nSo, cos A = 7/13.\n\nOkay, so sin A = 2\u221a30 /13, and cos A =7/13.\n\nNow, since we know angle A, we can find sides b and c.\n\nWait, sides b and c are AC and AB, respectively.\n\nWe know that in triangle ABC, the Law of Cosines says that a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nBut we don't know a yet. Alternatively, we can find sides in terms of R.\n\nWait, since R =13, and a = 2R sin A.\n\nWait, a is the side opposite angle A, which is BC. So, a = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2\u221a30 /13 )= 2*2\u221a30 =4\u221a30.\n\nSo, BC = a =4\u221a30.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, knowing that a =4\u221a30, and cos A =7/13, maybe we can relate sides b and c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the formula for the inradius.\n\nWe know that r = \u0394 / s, where \u0394 is the area and s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nWe have r =6. So, \u0394 =6*s.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed as \u0394 = (1/2)ab sin C, but perhaps more useful is using Heron's formula.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to express \u0394 in terms of sides and angle A.\n\nWe know that \u0394 = (1/2) bc sin A.\n\nSo, \u0394 = (1/2) bc sin A = (1/2) bc*(2\u221a30 /13 )= bc*(\u221a30 /13 ).\n\nBut \u0394 is also equal to r*s =6*s.\n\nSo, bc*(\u221a30 /13 )=6*s.\n\nHmm, okay. Also, we can express s in terms of a, b, c: s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, s = (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2.\n\nPutting it all together: bc*(\u221a30 /13 ) =6*(4\u221a30 + b + c)/2.\n\nSimplify the right side: 6*( (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2 )= 3*(4\u221a30 + b + c).\n\nSo, bc*(\u221a30 /13 ) =3*(4\u221a30 + b + c).\n\nHmm, that's one equation. Now, we need another equation to relate b and c.\n\nAnother relation comes from the Law of Cosines. As we said earlier, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nWe have a =4\u221a30, so a\u00b2 = (4\u221a30)\u00b2 =16*30=480.\n\ncos A is 7/13, so:\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13).\n\nSo, 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nHmm, so that's equation two.\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1) bc*(\u221a30 /13 ) =3*(4\u221a30 + b + c)\n\n2) b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc =480.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\nEquation 1:\n\n(bc\u221a30)/13 = 12\u221a30 + 3b +3c.\n\nEquation 2:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc =480.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can manipulate equation 1 to express in terms of bc.\n\nLet me denote x = bc, and y = b + c.\n\nThen, equation 1 becomes:\n\n(x\u221a30)/13 =12\u221a30 +3y.\n\nEquation 2: Let's see, since b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (b + c)^2 - 2bc = y\u00b2 - 2x.\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes:\n\ny\u00b2 -2x - (14/13)x =480.\n\nWhich simplifies to y\u00b2 - (2 +14/13)x =480.\n\nCompute 2 +14/13: 2 is 26/13, so 26/13 +14/13=40/13.\n\nSo, equation 2: y\u00b2 - (40/13)x =480.\n\nSo, equation 1: (x\u221a30)/13 =12\u221a30 +3y.\n\nLet me solve equation 1 for y.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 3:\n\n(x\u221a30)/(13*3) =4\u221a30 + y.\n\nSo, y = (x\u221a30)/(39) -4\u221a30.\n\nHmm, okay. So, y = [x\u221a30 - 156\u221a30]/39.\n\nWait, 4\u221a30 is (4\u221a30 *13)/13= (52\u221a30)/13. Wait, perhaps I should express it as:\n\nWait, equation 1 is:\n\n(x\u221a30)/13 =12\u221a30 +3y.\n\nSo, 3y = (x\u221a30)/13 -12\u221a30.\n\nSo, y = [ (x\u221a30)/13 -12\u221a30 ] /3.\n\nFactor out \u221a30:\n\ny = \u221a30 [x/(13) -12 ] /3 = \u221a30 (x -12*13)/ (13*3) )= \u221a30 (x -156)/(39).\n\nSo, y = \u221a30 (x -156)/39.\n\nSo, y = [\u221a30 (x -156)] /39.\n\nHmm. Now, we can substitute this into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2: y\u00b2 - (40/13)x =480.\n\nSo, [\u221a30 (x -156)/39]^2 - (40/13)x =480.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute y\u00b2:\n\n[\u221a30 (x -156)/39]^2 = (30 (x -156)^2 )/(39^2) = (30 (x -156)^2 )/(1521).\n\nSimplify 30/1521: 30 divides by 3, 1521 \u00f73=507. So, 10/507.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = (10 (x -156)^2 )/507.\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes:\n\n(10 (x -156)^2 )/507 - (40/13)x =480.\n\nMultiply both sides by 507 to eliminate denominators:\n\n10(x -156)^2 - (40/13)x *507 =480*507.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 10(x -156)^2.\n\nSecond term: (40/13)*507 x =40*(507/13) x. 507 \u00f713=39, so 40*39=1560. So, second term is -1560x.\n\nThird term: 480*507. Let me compute that.\n\nCompute 500*507=253,500, and 80*507=40,560. So total is 253,500 +40,560=294,060.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n10(x\u00b2 - 312x +156\u00b2) -1560x =294,060.\n\nCompute 156\u00b2: 156*156.\n\n150\u00b2=22500, 6\u00b2=36, 2*150*6=1800. So, (150+6)^2=150\u00b2 +2*150*6 +6\u00b2=22500 +1800 +36=24336.\n\nSo, 10(x\u00b2 -312x +24336) -1560x =294,060.\n\nExpand:\n\n10x\u00b2 -3120x +243,360 -1560x =294,060.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n10x\u00b2 - (3120 +1560)x +243,360 =294,060.\n\nWhich is 10x\u00b2 -4680x +243,360 =294,060.\n\nSubtract 294,060 from both sides:\n\n10x\u00b2 -4680x +243,360 -294,060 =0.\n\nCompute 243,360 -294,060: that's -50,700.\n\nSo, 10x\u00b2 -4680x -50,700 =0.\n\nDivide both sides by 10 to simplify:\n\nx\u00b2 -468x -5,070 =0.\n\nSo, quadratic equation: x\u00b2 -468x -5,070 =0.\n\nWait, that seems a bit large. Let me check my calculations.\n\nWait, when I multiplied both sides by 507, I had:\n\n10(x -156)^2 -1560x =294,060.\n\nBut perhaps I made an error in the expansion. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the first term is 10(x -156)^2, which is 10*(x\u00b2 - 312x +24336) =10x\u00b2 -3120x +243360.\n\nThen, subtracting 1560x: so 10x\u00b2 -3120x -1560x +243360 =10x\u00b2 -4680x +243360.\n\nThen, setting equal to 294,060: 10x\u00b2 -4680x +243360 =294,060.\n\nSubtract 294,060: 10x\u00b2 -4680x -50,700 =0.\n\nDivide by 10: x\u00b2 -468x -5,070 =0.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, solving x\u00b2 -468x -5,070 =0.\n\nWe can use quadratic formula. x = [468 \u00b1 sqrt(468\u00b2 +4*5070)] /2.\n\nCompute discriminant D =468\u00b2 +4*5070.\n\nCompute 468\u00b2: 468*468.\n\nLet me compute 400\u00b2=160,000, 68\u00b2=4,624, 2*400*68=54,400.\n\nSo, (400+68)^2=400\u00b2 +2*400*68 +68\u00b2=160,000 +54,400 +4,624=219,024.\n\nThen, 4*5070=20,280.\n\nSo, D=219,024 +20,280=239,304.\n\nNow, sqrt(239,304). Let me see: 489\u00b2=239,121, because 500\u00b2=250,000, so 489\u00b2= (500 -11)^2=500\u00b2 -2*500*11 +11\u00b2=250,000 -11,000 +121=239,121.\n\nWait, 489\u00b2=239,121. So, 489\u00b2 +183=239,304.\n\nWait, 489\u00b2=239,121, so 489\u00b2 +183=239,304.\n\nHmm, but 183 is not a perfect square. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, 239,304 divided by 16 is 14,956.5, which is not integer. Maybe it's a square of some number.\n\nWait, let me try 489. Let me compute 489\u00b2= (490 -1)^2=490\u00b2 -2*490 +1=240,100 -980 +1=239,121.\n\nSo, 489\u00b2=239,121. Then, 490\u00b2=240,100. So, 239,304 is between 489\u00b2 and 490\u00b2.\n\nSo, sqrt(239,304)=489 + (239,304-239,121)/(2*489 +1).\n\nSo, 239,304-239,121=183. So, sqrt(239,304)=489 +183/(978 +1)=489 +183/979\u2248489 +0.186\u2248489.186. Hmm, but that's not an integer. So, perhaps my approach has an error.\n\nWait, maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nLet me retrace my steps.\n\nWe had equation 1: (x\u221a30)/13 =12\u221a30 +3y.\n\nI solved for y and got y = [\u221a30 (x -156)] /39.\n\nThen, equation 2: y\u00b2 - (40/13)x =480.\n\nSubstituted y and squared, leading to a quadratic in x.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in expanding (x -156)^2.\n\nWait, (x -156)^2 =x\u00b2 - 2*156x +156\u00b2= x\u00b2 -312x +24336.\n\nSo, 10*(x\u00b2 -312x +24336)=10x\u00b2 -3120x +243,360.\n\nThen, subtracting 1560x: 10x\u00b2 -3120x -1560x +243,360=10x\u00b2 -4680x +243,360.\n\nSet equal to 294,060.\n\n10x\u00b2 -4680x +243,360=294,060.\n\nSubtract 294,060: 10x\u00b2 -4680x -50,700=0.\n\nDivide by 10: x\u00b2 -468x -5,070=0.\n\nQuadratic equation: x\u00b2 -468x -5,070=0.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor this, but 468 and 5070 are large numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor 5,070 to find possible roots.\n\nWait, 5,070 divided by 10 is 507. 507=13*39=13*13*3.\n\nSo, 5,070=2*3*5*13\u00b2.\n\nHmm, perhaps the quadratic can be factored as (x - a)(x + b)=0, where a and b are numbers such that a*b=5,070 and a -b=468.\n\nWait, but 5,070 is positive, and a - b=468, but a*b=5,070. Hmm, but if a and b are positive, then a would be larger than b, so a - b=468, and a*b=5,070.\n\nBut 5,070 is less than 468^2, which is 219,024. So, it's possible.\n\nBut factoring might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the quadratic formula.\n\nSo, x = [468 \u00b1 sqrt(468\u00b2 +4*5,070)] /2.\n\nWait, wait, the quadratic is x\u00b2 -468x -5,070=0. So, a=1, b=-468, c=-5,070.\n\nSo, discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac= (-468)^2 -4*1*(-5,070)=468\u00b2 +4*5,070.\n\nWait, earlier I computed 468\u00b2=219,024, and 4*5,070=20,280. So, D=219,024 +20,280=239,304.\n\nHmm, same as before.\n\nSo, sqrt(239,304). Let me see: 489\u00b2=239,121, 490\u00b2=240,100. So, it's between 489 and 490.\n\nWait, 239,304 -239,121=183. So, sqrt(239,304)=489 +183/(2*489 +1)=489 +183/979\u2248489.186.\n\nBut that's not an integer, which is a problem because x is bc, which should be an integer perhaps, or at least a rational number. So, maybe I made a mistake earlier in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in equation 1. Let me check.\n\nEquation 1: bc*(\u221a30 /13 ) =3*(4\u221a30 + b + c).\n\nWait, from earlier steps, equation 1 came from \u0394 = (1/2) bc sin A =6*s.\n\nAnd sin A =2\u221a30 /13, so (1/2) bc*(2\u221a30 /13)= (bc\u221a30)/13.\n\nAnd 6*s=6*(a +b +c)/2=3*(a +b +c)=3*(4\u221a30 +b +c).\n\nSo, equation 1 is correct.\n\nEquation 2: a\u00b2=480= b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nThat came from the Law of Cosines: a\u00b2 =b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A, and cos A=7/13, so 2bc cos A= (14/13) bc.\n\nSo, equation 2 is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the quadratic is correct, and x is not an integer. So, I'll proceed with the quadratic formula.\n\nx = [468 \u00b1 sqrt(239,304)] /2.\n\nWe can write sqrt(239,304)=sqrt(16*14,956.5). Wait, no, 239,304 divided by 16 is 14,956.5, which is not integer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's divisible by 4: 239,304 /4=59,826. 59,826 /2=29,913. Hmm, 29,913 divided by 3 is 9,971. So, 239,304=4*2*3*9,971=24*9,971.\n\nWait, 9,971 is a prime? Maybe. Hmm, perhaps not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write sqrt(239,304)=sqrt(239,304)=489.186 as before.\n\nBut maybe I can keep it symbolic for now.\n\nSo, x= [468 \u00b1489.186 ] /2.\n\nSo, two solutions:\n\nx=(468 +489.186)/2= (957.186)/2\u2248478.593\n\nx=(468 -489.186)/2= (-21.186)/2\u2248-10.593.\n\nSince x=bc is positive, we take the positive solution, x\u2248478.593.\n\nHmm, but bc is approximately 478.593. But since the problem asks for AB\u00b7AC= c\u00b7b= x, which is this value.\n\nBut the problem is expecting an integer, probably. So, maybe my earlier approach has a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for IA.\n\nWait, I assumed IA = r / sin(A/2). Is that correct?\n\nWait, let me recall: in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be found using the formula IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)).\n\nYes, that's correct. So, IA = r / sin(A/2).\n\nSo, that part was correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify the formula for IA. I think it's IA = 2R sin(A/2 + 45\u00b0) or something, but maybe I'm confusing it with another formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for another formula for IA.\n\nWait, another formula for IA is IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)).\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, IA can be expressed as sqrt(R(R - 2r_A)), where r_A is the exradius opposite A. Wait, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use coordinates.\n\nLet me consider placing the triangle in coordinate system to model the problem.\n\nLet me place point I at the origin (0,0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and O is the circumradius center. Wait, but O is the circumradius center, which is not necessarily at the origin.\n\nWait, maybe I can set up coordinates such that I is at (0,0), and O lies along the x-axis.\n\nSo, let me set I at (0,0), and O at (d, 0), where d is the distance OI.\n\nWe know OI = sqrt(13), so d = sqrt(13).\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is along the x-axis, IA must be along the y-axis.\n\nSo, point A is somewhere along the y-axis. Let me denote point A as (0, a), where a is the length IA.\n\nFrom earlier, we have IA =2\u221a39, so point A is (0, 2\u221a39).\n\nWait, but wait, if I is at (0,0), and IA is perpendicular to OI, then O is at (sqrt(13),0), and A is at (0,2\u221a39).\n\nNow, the circumradius is 13, so the circumcircle has center at (sqrt(13),0) and radius 13.\n\nSo, point A lies on this circumcircle. Let's check the distance from O to A.\n\nDistance OA: sqrt( (sqrt(13) -0)^2 + (0 -2\u221a39)^2 )= sqrt(13 + 4*39)= sqrt(13 +156)=sqrt(169)=13, which matches the circumradius.\n\nGood, that checks out.\n\nNow, the triangle ABC has incenter at I=(0,0), and circumcenter at O=(sqrt(13),0). Point A is at (0,2\u221a39).\n\nWe need to find the coordinates of points B and C such that I is the incenter.\n\nHmm, this might be a bit involved, but perhaps we can find the coordinates of B and C.\n\nLet me denote points B and C as (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), respectively.\n\nSince I is the incenter, it lies at the intersection of the angle bisectors. The coordinates of the incenter can be found using the formula:\n\nI = (aA + bB + cC)/(a + b + c),\n\nwhere a, b, c are the lengths of the sides opposite angles A, B, C, respectively.\n\nBut in our case, I is at (0,0), so:\n\n( a*A + b*B + c*C ) / (a + b + c ) = (0,0).\n\nSo,\n\na*A + b*B + c*C = (0,0).\n\nBut this seems complicated because we don't know a, b, c.\n\nAlternatively, since I is the incenter, the distances from I to each side are equal to r=6.\n\nSo, the distance from I=(0,0) to side BC is 6.\n\nSimilarly, the distance from I to AB and AC is 6.\n\nBut since we have point A at (0,2\u221a39), and I at (0,0), the distance from I to AB and AC can be calculated.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the inradius in terms of coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find equations of sides AB and AC.\n\nWait, since point A is at (0,2\u221a39), and incenter I is at (0,0), the angle bisector of angle A goes through I. So, the line AI is the angle bisector of angle A.\n\nSince AI is along the y-axis (from (0,2\u221a39) to (0,0)), the angle bisector is the y-axis.\n\nSo, the sides AB and AC are symmetric with respect to the y-axis.\n\nWait, because the angle bisector is the y-axis, so the triangle is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. So, points B and C are symmetric across the y-axis.\n\nSo, if point B is at (x, y), then point C is at (-x, y).\n\nWait, but since I is the incenter at (0,0), which is on the y-axis, and O is at (sqrt(13),0), which is on the x-axis, the triangle is not symmetric with respect to the x-axis, but perhaps symmetric with respect to the y-axis.\n\nWait, if the triangle is symmetric across the y-axis, then sides AB and AC would be mirror images.\n\nSo, point B is at (x, y) and point C is at (-x, y). Then, side BC is horizontal, from (-x,y) to (x,y), so midpoint at (0,y), which is on the y-axis.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nSo, let's denote point B as (x, y) and point C as (-x, y).\n\nSo, the coordinates are:\n\nA: (0, 2\u221a39)\n\nB: (x, y)\n\nC: (-x, y)\n\nO: (\u221a13, 0)\n\nI: (0,0)\n\nNow, since O is the circumcenter, all points A, B, C are at distance 13 from O.\n\nSo, distance from O to A: sqrt( (sqrt(13)-0)^2 + (0 -2\u221a39)^2 )=sqrt(13 + 4*39)=sqrt(13+156)=sqrt(169)=13. Correct.\n\nDistance from O to B: sqrt( (sqrt(13)-x)^2 + (0 - y)^2 )=13.\n\nSimilarly, distance from O to C: same as B, since C is (-x,y).\n\nSo, equation for point B:\n\n( sqrt(13) - x )\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =13\u00b2=169.\n\nSimilarly, point A is (0, 2\u221a39), so the triangle has vertices at these points.\n\nNow, the inradius is 6, and I is at (0,0). The inradius is the distance from I to each side.\n\nSo, the distance from I=(0,0) to side BC is 6.\n\nSide BC is the line joining points B=(x,y) and C=(-x,y). So, the equation of BC is y = y_coordinate, since it's a horizontal line.\n\nWait, points B and C are (x,y) and (-x,y), so the line BC is y = y.\n\nSo, the distance from I=(0,0) to line BC is |0 - y| / sqrt(0\u00b2 +1\u00b2) )= | -y | = |y|.\n\nSo, |y|=6. Since y is positive (as point A is above the x-axis and the triangle is above the x-axis), y=6.\n\nSo, y=6.\n\nSo, points B and C are (x,6) and (-x,6).\n\nSo, now we can update the equation for point B:\n\n( sqrt(13) - x )\u00b2 +6\u00b2 =169.\n\nCompute:\n\n( sqrt(13) -x )\u00b2 +36 =169.\n\nSo, ( sqrt(13) -x )\u00b2 =133.\n\nTake square root:\n\nsqrt(13) -x = \u00b1sqrt(133).\n\nSo, x= sqrt(13) \u2213 sqrt(133).\n\nBut x must be real. Let me compute sqrt(133): approximately 11.532.\n\nsqrt(13)\u22483.606.\n\nSo, x=3.606 -11.532\u2248-7.926, or x=3.606 +11.532\u224815.138.\n\nBut since point B is at (x,6), and the triangle is symmetric across the y-axis, x can be positive or negative, but since we've already considered B and C as (x,6) and (-x,6), perhaps we take x as positive.\n\nSo, x= sqrt(13) + sqrt(133). Wait, but sqrt(133) is larger than sqrt(13), so x would be positive.\n\nWait, but let me compute ( sqrt(13) -x )\u00b2 =133.\n\nSo, sqrt(13) -x = sqrt(133) => x= sqrt(13) - sqrt(133). That would be negative, which would place B at negative x, but since we have C at (-x,6), perhaps it's better to take x= sqrt(13) + sqrt(133).\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nIf sqrt(13) -x = sqrt(133), then x= sqrt(13) - sqrt(133). Since sqrt(133) > sqrt(13), x would be negative, which would place B at (-|x|,6), but since C is at (-x,6), perhaps it's better to take the positive solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.\n\nWait, equation: ( sqrt(13) -x )\u00b2 =133.\n\nSo, sqrt(13) -x = \u00b1sqrt(133).\n\nSo, x= sqrt(13) \u2213 sqrt(133).\n\nSo, x could be sqrt(13) + sqrt(133) or sqrt(13) - sqrt(133).\n\nBut sqrt(13) is about 3.605, sqrt(133)=11.532.\n\nSo, x=3.605 -11.532\u2248-7.927, or x=3.605 +11.532\u224815.137.\n\nSo, point B is at (15.137,6) or (-7.927,6). But since we have C at (-x,6), if x is positive, then C would be at (-15.137,6). Alternatively, if x is negative, C would be at (7.927,6).\n\nBut the triangle should have all three points, so perhaps taking x positive is better.\n\nSo, let's take x= sqrt(13) + sqrt(133).\n\nWait, but sqrt(13) + sqrt(133)=approx 3.605 +11.532=15.137, as above.\n\nSo, point B is at (15.137,6), and point C is at (-15.137,6).\n\nWait, but then side BC would be from (-15.137,6) to (15.137,6), which is a horizontal line 30.274 units long. Hmm, but let's compute the exact value.\n\nWait, the length BC is 2x, since B is at (x,6) and C at (-x,6). So, BC=2x.\n\nBut earlier, we found that a= BC=4\u221a30\u224821.908.\n\nSo, 2x=4\u221a30 =>x=2\u221a30\u224810.954.\n\nBut according to our earlier calculation, x= sqrt(13)+sqrt(133)=approx 15.137, which is larger than 2\u221a30\u224810.954. So, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that the triangle is symmetric about the y-axis. Wait, is that necessarily true?\n\nWait, because AI is the angle bisector, which we've placed along the y-axis, but the triangle's other sides may not necessarily be symmetric about the y-axis. Wait, but in our setup, with O at (sqrt(13),0), I at (0,0), and A at (0,2\u221a39), perhaps the triangle is not symmetric. Hmm, maybe I made an error in assuming symmetry.\n\nWait, perhaps I shouldn't assume symmetry. Let me try a different approach.\n\nGiven that the incenter is at (0,0), the circumradius center at (sqrt(13),0), and point A at (0,2\u221a39). Let's find the coordinates of points B and C.\n\nWe know that points B and C lie on the circumcircle centered at (sqrt(13),0) with radius 13. So, their coordinates satisfy:\n\n(x - sqrt(13))\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =169.\n\nAdditionally, the inradius is 6, so the distance from I=(0,0) to each side is 6.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the inradius in terms of coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the equations of sides AB and AC, knowing that the distance from I=(0,0) to each is 6.\n\nPoint A is at (0,2\u221a39). Let me denote points B and C as (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).\n\nThe equation of line AB can be found using points A and B.\n\nThe general equation of line AB is: (y - 2\u221a39) = m1 (x - 0), where m1 is the slope.\n\nSimilarly, the distance from I=(0,0) to line AB is 6.\n\nThe distance from a point (x0,y0) to the line ax + by +c=0 is |ax0 + by0 +c| / sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2).\n\nSo, let's write the equation of AB in standard form.\n\nLine AB passes through (0,2\u221a39) and (x1,y1). Its equation can be written as:\n\n(y - 2\u221a39) = (y1 - 2\u221a39)/x1 * x.\n\nMultiplying both sides by x1:\n\nx1(y - 2\u221a39) = (y1 - 2\u221a39) x.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n(y1 - 2\u221a39)x -x1 y + 2\u221a39 x1=0.\n\nSo, the standard form is:\n\n(y1 - 2\u221a39)x -x1 y + 2\u221a39 x1=0.\n\nThe distance from (0,0) to this line is:\n\n| (y1 - 2\u221a39)*0 -x1*0 +2\u221a39 x1 | / sqrt( (y1 - 2\u221a39)^2 + (-x1)^2 ) = |2\u221a39 x1| / sqrt( (y1 - 2\u221a39)^2 +x1\u00b2 ) =6.\n\nSo,\n\n|2\u221a39 x1| / sqrt( (y1 - 2\u221a39)^2 +x1\u00b2 )=6.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(4*39 x1\u00b2 ) / ( (y1 - 2\u221a39)^2 +x1\u00b2 )=36.\n\nSimplify numerator:4*39=156.\n\nSo,\n\n156 x1\u00b2 =36 [ (y1 - 2\u221a39)^2 +x1\u00b2 ].\n\nDivide both sides by 12:\n\n13 x1\u00b2 =3 [ (y1 - 2\u221a39)^2 +x1\u00b2 ].\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n13x1\u00b2=3(y1\u00b2 -4\u221a39 y1 + 4*39) +3x1\u00b2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n13x1\u00b2=3y1\u00b2 -12\u221a39 y1 + 507 +3x1\u00b2.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n13x1\u00b2 -3x1\u00b2 -3y1\u00b2 +12\u221a39 y1 -507=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n10x1\u00b2 -3y1\u00b2 +12\u221a39 y1 -507=0.\n\nHmm, that's a complicated equation.\n\nBut we also know that point B lies on the circumcircle, so:\n\n(x1 - sqrt(13))\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 =169.\n\nExpanding:\n\nx1\u00b2 -2 sqrt(13) x1 +13 + y1\u00b2=169.\n\nSo,\n\nx1\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 -2 sqrt(13) x1 =156.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) 10x1\u00b2 -3y1\u00b2 +12\u221a39 y1 -507=0.\n\n2) x1\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 -2 sqrt(13) x1 =156.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can solve these two equations together.\n\nLet me denote equation 2 as:\n\nx1\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 =156 +2 sqrt(13) x1.\n\nLet me express x1\u00b2 from equation 2:\n\nx1\u00b2=156 +2 sqrt(13) x1 - y1\u00b2.\n\nNow, substitute x1\u00b2 into equation 1.\n\nEquation 1:\n\n10x1\u00b2 -3y1\u00b2 +12\u221a39 y1 -507=0.\n\nSubstitute x1\u00b2:\n\n10*(156 +2 sqrt(13) x1 - y1\u00b2) -3y1\u00b2 +12\u221a39 y1 -507=0.\n\nCompute:\n\n10*156=1560,\n\n10*2 sqrt(13) x1=20 sqrt(13) x1,\n\n10*(-y1\u00b2)= -10y1\u00b2,\n\nSo,\n\n1560 +20 sqrt(13) x1 -10y1\u00b2 -3y1\u00b2 +12\u221a39 y1 -507=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1560 -507=1053,\n\n20 sqrt(13) x1,\n\n-10y1\u00b2 -3y1\u00b2= -13y1\u00b2,\n\n+12\u221a39 y1.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n1053 +20 sqrt(13) x1 -13y1\u00b2 +12\u221a39 y1=0.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can express y1 in terms of x1 from equation 2.\n\nWait, from equation 2: x1\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 =156 +2 sqrt(13) x1.\n\nLet me solve for y1\u00b2:\n\ny1\u00b2=156 +2 sqrt(13) x1 -x1\u00b2.\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\n1053 +20 sqrt(13) x1 -13*(156 +2 sqrt(13) x1 -x1\u00b2 ) +12\u221a39 y1=0.\n\nCompute term by term:\n\n-13*(156)= -2028,\n\n-13*(2 sqrt(13) x1)= -26 sqrt(13) x1,\n\n-13*(-x1\u00b2)=13x1\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n1053 +20 sqrt(13) x1 -2028 -26 sqrt(13) x1 +13x1\u00b2 +12\u221a39 y1=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1053 -2028= -975,\n\n20 sqrt(13) x1 -26 sqrt(13) x1= -6 sqrt(13) x1,\n\n+13x1\u00b2,\n\n+12\u221a39 y1.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n13x1\u00b2 -6 sqrt(13) x1 -975 +12\u221a39 y1=0.\n\nHmm, not helpful. Maybe I can express y1 in terms of x1 from equation 2.\n\nWait, from equation 2: y1\u00b2=156 +2 sqrt(13) x1 -x1\u00b2.\n\nBut that's a square, so y1= sqrt(156 +2 sqrt(13) x1 -x1\u00b2). But that's messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a relationship between x1 and y1.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is too complicated. Maybe I should go back to the earlier approach with the quadratic equation.\n\nEarlier, we had x\u2248478.593, which is bc\u2248478.593.\n\nBut the problem asks for AB\u00b7AC= bc, so perhaps the answer is approximately 478.593, but since it's an integer, maybe it's 480? But 478.593 is close to 480, but not exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check.\n\nWait, when I set up the quadratic equation, perhaps I made a mistake in the coefficients.\n\nLet me go back to the two equations:\n\n1) (x\u221a30)/13 =12\u221a30 +3y.\n\n2) y\u00b2 - (40/13)x =480.\n\nWe found y= [\u221a30 (x -156)] /39.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, equation 1: (x\u221a30)/13 =12\u221a30 +3y.\n\nSo, 3y= (x\u221a30)/13 -12\u221a30.\n\nSo, y= [ (x\u221a30)/13 -12\u221a30 ] /3.\n\nFactor out \u221a30:\n\ny= \u221a30 [x/(13) -12 ] /3.\n\nWhich is y= \u221a30 (x - 156)/(39).\n\nSo, y= [\u221a30 (x -156)] /39.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nThen, equation 2: y\u00b2 - (40/13)x =480.\n\nSubstitute y:\n\n[\u221a30 (x -156)/39]^2 - (40/13)x =480.\n\nCompute:\n\n(30 (x -156)^2 )/(39^2) - (40/13)x =480.\n\n39^2=1521.\n\nSo, 30/1521=10/507.\n\nSo, [10 (x -156)^2 ]/507 - (40/13)x =480.\n\nMultiply both sides by 507:\n\n10(x -156)^2 - (40/13)x *507=480*507.\n\nCompute:\n\n(40/13)*507=40*39=1560.\n\nSo, 10(x\u00b2 -312x +24336) -1560x =294,060.\n\nSo,\n\n10x\u00b2 -3120x +243360 -1560x =294,060.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n10x\u00b2 -4680x +243360 =294,060.\n\nSubtract 294,060:\n\n10x\u00b2 -4680x -50,700=0.\n\nDivide by 10:\n\nx\u00b2 -468x -5,070=0.\n\nQuadratic equation: x\u00b2 -468x -5,070=0.\n\nSo, discriminant D=468\u00b2 +4*5,070=219,024 +20,280=239,304.\n\nSo, sqrt(239,304)= approx 489.186.\n\nSo, x=(468 +489.186)/2=957.186/2\u2248478.593.\n\nHmm, so x\u2248478.593.\n\nBut wait, earlier I found that a= BC=4\u221a30\u224821.908, and the semi-perimeter s=(a +b +c)/2.\n\nBut since b and c are sides AB and AC, and their product is x\u2248478.593, perhaps we can find AB and AC individually.\n\nWait, but the problem only asks for AB\u00b7AC, which is x. So, perhaps the answer is 478.593, but since the problem likely expects an integer, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe the answer is 480, as it's close to 478.593, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I can check using another formula.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the product AB\u00b7AC can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles.\n\nWait, since AB=c, AC=b, then AB\u00b7AC= bc.\n\nWe also know that from the Law of Cosines: a\u00b2 =b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nWe have a=4\u221a30, so a\u00b2=480.\n\ncos A=7/13.\n\nSo, 480 =b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nAnd from the area formula: bc sin A = 2\u0394.\n\nAnd \u0394= r*s=6s.\n\nBut s=(a +b +c)/2.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps we can express b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 in terms of bc.\n\nFrom equation:480 =b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nb\u00b2 +c\u00b2=480 + (14/13) bc.\n\nBut also, we know that (b +c)^2 =b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 +2bc.\n\nSo, (b +c)^2= [480 + (14/13) bc ] + 2bc=480 + (14/13 + 26/13 ) bc=480 + (40/13) bc.\n\nSo, (b +c)^2=480 + (40/13) bc.\n\nBut from the earlier equation, we have s=(a +b +c)/2=(4\u221a30 +b +c)/2.\n\nAnd from the area: \u0394=6s= (bc\u221a30)/13.\n\nSo, 6*(4\u221a30 +b +c)/2= (bc\u221a30)/13.\n\nSimplify: 3*(4\u221a30 +b +c)= (bc\u221a30)/13.\n\nSo, 12\u221a30 +3b +3c= (bc\u221a30)/13.\n\nMultiply both sides by13:\n\n156\u221a30 +39b +39c= bc\u221a30.\n\nRearranged: bc\u221a30 -39b -39c=156\u221a30.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor this equation.\n\nAlternatively, let me factor b and c.\n\nbc\u221a30 -39b -39c=156\u221a30.\n\nAdd 39\u00b2 to both sides to complete the rectangle.\n\nSo, bc\u221a30 -39b -39c + (39)^2=156\u221a30 + (39)^2.\n\nSo, (b -39)(c -39)\u221a30=156\u221a30 + 1521.\n\nWait, but this might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can let u =b +c, v= bc.\n\nThen, from the equation:\n\nv\u221a30/13 =12\u221a30 +3u.\n\nWhich gives:\n\nv\u221a30 =156\u221a30 +39u.\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a30:\n\nv=156 + (39u)/\u221a30.\n\nBut that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, from the equation:\n\nv\u221a30 -39u=156\u221a30.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express u in terms of v.\n\nWait, earlier we had (b +c)^2=480 + (40/13)v.\n\nSo, u\u00b2=480 + (40/13)v.\n\nSo, u= sqrt(480 + (40/13)v).\n\nBut this might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can substitute u from one equation into another.\n\nWait, from equation 1: v\u221a30/13 =12\u221a30 +3u.\n\nSo, 3u= v\u221a30/13 -12\u221a30.\n\nSo, u= (v\u221a30 -156\u221a30 )/(39).\n\nWhich is u= [\u221a30 (v -156)] /39.\n\nThen, from equation 2: u\u00b2=480 + (40/13)v.\n\nSubstituting u:\n\n[\u221a30 (v -156)/39]^2 =480 + (40/13)v.\n\nCompute left side:\n\n(30 (v -156)^2 )/(39^2 )= (30/1521)(v -156)^2= (10/507)(v -156)^2.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(10/507)(v -156)^2 =480 + (40/13)v.\n\nMultiply both sides by 507 to eliminate denominator:\n\n10(v -156)^2 =480*507 + (40/13)v *507.\n\nCompute:\n\n480*507=243,360.\n\n(40/13)*507=40*39=1560.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n10(v\u00b2 - 312v +156\u00b2 )=243,360 +1560v.\n\nCompute 156\u00b2=24,336.\n\nSo,\n\n10v\u00b2 -3120v +243,360=243,360 +1560v.\n\nSubtract 243,360 from both sides:\n\n10v\u00b2 -3120v =1560v.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n10v\u00b2 -3120v -1560v=0.\n\nSo,\n\n10v\u00b2 -4680v=0.\n\nFactor:\n\n10v(v -468)=0.\n\nSo, solutions v=0 or v=468.\n\nSince v=bc is positive, v=468.\n\nSo, bc=468.\n\nWait, this contradicts our earlier result of approximately 478.593.\n\nHmm, so where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in this approach, I set u =b +c and v= bc.\n\nFrom equation 1, I derived u= [\u221a30 (v -156)] /39.\n\nThen, from equation 2, I used u\u00b2=480 + (40/13)v.\n\nSubstituting u gave me a quadratic equation leading to v=468.\n\nBut earlier, when I set up the equations with x= bc, I got x\u2248478.593.\n\nBut this approach gives bc=468.\n\nHmm, but 468 is an integer, which is more plausible.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is 468.\n\nWait, but why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake earlier in the setup.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I set x= bc and y= b +c, leading to a quadratic equation with solution x\u2248478.593, but perhaps that approach had an error.\n\nIn the second approach, by letting u= b +c and v= bc, I arrived at v=468, which is an integer and more likely the correct answer.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is 468.\n\nWait, but let me verify.\n\nIf bc=468, then from equation 1: v\u221a30 /13 =12\u221a30 +3u.\n\nSo, 468\u221a30 /13 =12\u221a30 +3u.\n\nCompute 468/13=36, so 36\u221a30=12\u221a30 +3u.\n\nSo, 36\u221a30 -12\u221a30=3u =>24\u221a30=3u =>u=8\u221a30.\n\nSo, u=8\u221a30.\n\nSo, b +c=8\u221a30.\n\nThen, from equation 2: u\u00b2=480 + (40/13)v.\n\nu\u00b2= (8\u221a30)^2=64*30=1920.\n\nSo, 1920=480 + (40/13)*468.\n\nCompute (40/13)*468=40*(468/13)=40*36=1440.\n\nSo, 480 +1440=1920, which matches.\n\nSo, this approach is correct, leading to bc=468.\n\nEarlier, the first approach must have had an error, perhaps in the setup of the equations.\n\nTherefore, the correct value of AB\u00b7AC= bc=468.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again.\n\nWe have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It says that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB\u00b7AC.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's try to visualize the triangle. So, triangle ABC with circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6. IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important.\n\nFirst, I remember that the circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle by the formula a/(2 sin A) = R, where a is the length opposite angle A. Similarly, the inradius r is related by the formula r = \u0394/s, where \u0394 is the area and s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. Since we have both R and r, perhaps we can find some relation between them. Also, the condition IA perpendicular to OI might be key here.\n\nLet me recall some properties. The incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors. In some cases, like in an equilateral triangle, O and I coincide, but here they're different since IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nI think there's a formula that relates R, r, and the distance between O and I. Oh right! The formula is OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me verify. I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Hmm, no, wait: OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So that would make OI = sqrt(R\u00b2 - 2Rr). Let's compute that.\n\nGiven R = 13 and r = 6, so OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13). Hmm, okay.\n\nNow, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, IA \u22a5 OI. That must mean that triangle IOA is a right-angled triangle at I.\n\nWait, let me think. Point I is the incenter. So, IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. Hmm, in a triangle, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side, but IA is the distance from I to vertex A, which is not necessarily equal to r.\n\nWait, so IA is the length of the segment from I to A, which is different from the inradius. The inradius is the distance from I to each side, like IB or IC, but IA is a different length.\n\nSo, in triangle IOA, which is right-angled at I, we have sides OI, IA, and OA. We know OI is sqrt(13), OA is the circumradius, which is 13, and IA is the distance from incenter to A.\n\nSo, in triangle IOA, by Pythagoras: (IA)\u00b2 + (OI)\u00b2 = (OA)\u00b2.\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 + (sqrt(13))\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 => IA\u00b2 + 13 = 169 => IA\u00b2 = 156 => IA = sqrt(156). Let me simplify that: sqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nOkay, so IA = 2\u221a39. Now, what can I do with this information?\n\nI recall that in a triangle, the length of the inradius can be related to the area and semi-perimeter. Also, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides.\n\nWait, there's a formula for the length of IA. Let me recall it. I think it's IA = r / sin(A/2). Is that correct?\n\nYes, I think so. Because in the inradius, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed as IA = r / sin(A/2). Let me confirm this.\n\nIn triangle ABC, the inradius r is related to the angles. The distance from I to A is IA = r / sin(A/2). So, that's correct.\n\nSo, IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2) = 2\u221a39.\n\nSo, 6 / sin(A/2) = 2\u221a39. Let me solve for sin(A/2).\n\nsin(A/2) = 6 / (2\u221a39) = 3 / \u221a39 = (3\u221a39) / 39 = \u221a39 / 13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = \u221a39 / 13.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, from this, I can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin\u00b2x + cos\u00b2x = 1.\n\nSo, cos\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169 => cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nNow, what else can I find? Hmm, perhaps the sides of the triangle. Let me think about the formula for the sides in terms of R and the angles.\n\nWe know that a = 2R sin A. Similarly, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.\n\nWait, but in this case, we're interested in AB and AC, which are sides opposite to angles C and B, respectively. Wait, let's clarify.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, side opposite angle A is BC, denoted as a; side opposite angle B is AC, denoted as b; and side opposite angle C is AB, denoted as c.\n\nSo, AB is side c, and AC is side b. So, AB\u00b7AC = c\u00b7b.\n\nSo, we need to find the product c\u00b7b.\n\nHmm. Let's see. So, since we have expressions for sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), perhaps we can find angle A, and then find the sides.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can relate this to other triangle properties.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the product of the sides can be related to the area. Also, the area can be expressed in terms of inradius and semi-perimeter: \u0394 = r\u00b7s, where s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed as \u0394 = (a b c) / (4R). Hmm, but that might not be directly helpful here.\n\nWait, let's think about the formula for the area in terms of sine. The area \u0394 = (1/2)ab sin C, but perhaps that's not directly helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, since we know sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), we can find sin A and cos A.\n\nUsing double-angle identities:\n\nsin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(\u221a39/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = 2*(\u221a(39*130))/169.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 39 * 130 = 39 * 13 * 10 = 507 * 10 = 5070. So, sqrt(5070).\n\nWait, let me factor 5070 to see if it can be simplified.\n\n5070 = 10 * 507 = 10 * 3 * 169 = 10 * 3 * 13\u00b2. So, sqrt(5070) = sqrt(10*3*13\u00b2) = 13*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, sin A = 2*(13*sqrt(30))/169 = (26 sqrt(30))/169 = (2 sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSimilarly, cos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 -78)/169 = 91/169 = 7*13 / (13\u00b2) ) = 7/13.\n\nWait, no: 169 -78 is 91, so 91/169. Simplifying, 91 =13*7, so 91/169 = 7/13.\n\nSo, cos A = 7/13.\n\nOkay, so sin A = 2\u221a30 /13, and cos A =7/13.\n\nNow, since we know angle A, we can find sides b and c.\n\nWait, sides b and c are AC and AB, respectively.\n\nWe know that in triangle ABC, the Law of Cosines says that a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nBut we don't know a yet. Alternatively, we can find sides in terms of R.\n\nWait, since R =13, and a = 2R sin A.\n\nWait, a is the side opposite angle A, which is BC. So, a = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2\u221a30 /13 )= 2*2\u221a30 =4\u221a30.\n\nSo, BC = a =4\u221a30.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, knowing that a =4\u221a30, and cos A =7/13, maybe we can relate sides b and c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the formula for the inradius.\n\nWe know that r = \u0394 / s, where \u0394 is the area and s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nWe have r =6. So, \u0394 =6*s.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed as \u0394 = (1/2)ab sin C, but perhaps more useful is using Heron's formula.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to express \u0394 in terms of sides and angle A.\n\nWe know that \u0394 = (1/2) bc sin A.\n\nSo, \u0394 = (1/2) bc sin A = (1/2) bc*(2\u221a30 /13 )= bc*(\u221a30 /13 ).\n\nBut \u0394 is also equal to r*s =6*s.\n\nSo, bc*(\u221a30 /13 )=6*s.\n\nHmm, okay. Also, we can express s in terms of a, b, c: s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, s = (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2.\n\nPutting it all together: bc*(\u221a30 /13 ) =6*(4\u221a30 + b + c)/2.\n\nSimplify the right side: 6*( (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2 )= 3*(4\u221a30 + b + c).\n\nSo, bc*(\u221a30 /13 ) =3*(4\u221a30 + b + c).\n\nHmm, that's one equation. Now, we need another equation to relate b and c.\n\nAnother relation comes from the Law of Cosines. As we said earlier, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nWe have a =4\u221a30, so a\u00b2 = (4\u221a30)\u00b2 =16*30=480.\n\ncos A is 7/13, so:\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13).\n\nSo, 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nHmm, so that's equation two.\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1) bc*(\u221a30 /13 ) =3*(4\u221a30 + b + c)\n\n2) b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc =480.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\nEquation 1:\n\n(bc\u221a30)/13 = 12\u221a30 + 3b +3c.\n\nEquation 2:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc =480.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can manipulate equation 1 to express in terms of bc.\n\nLet me denote x = bc, and y = b + c.\n\nThen, equation 1 becomes:\n\n(x\u221a30)/13 =12\u221a30 +3y.\n\nEquation 2: Let's see, since b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (b + c)^2 - 2bc = y\u00b2 - 2x.\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes:\n\ny\u00b2 -2x - (14/13)x =480.\n\nWhich simplifies to y\u00b2 - (2 +14/13)x =480.\n\nCompute 2 +14/13: 2 is 26/13, so 26/13 +14/13=40/13.\n\nSo, equation 2: y\u00b2 - (40/13)x =480.\n\nSo, equation 1: (x\u221a30)/13 =12\u221a30 +3y.\n\nLet me solve equation 1 for y.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 3:\n\n(x\u221a30)/(13*3) =4\u221a30 + y.\n\nSo, y = (x\u221a30)/(39) -4\u221a30.\n\nHmm, okay. So, y = [x\u221a30 - 156\u221a30]/39.\n\nWait, 4\u221a30 is (4\u221a30 *13)/13= (52\u221a30)/13. Wait, perhaps I should express it as:\n\nWait, equation 1 is:\n\n(x\u221a30)/13 =12\u221a30 +3y.\n\nSo, 3y = (x\u221a30)/13 -12\u221a30.\n\nSo, y = [ (x\u221a30)/13 -12\u221a30 ] /3.\n\nFactor out \u221a30:\n\ny = \u221a30 [x/(13) -12 ] /3 = \u221a30 (x -12*13)/ (13*3) )= \u221a30 (x -156)/(39).\n\nSo, y = \u221a30 (x -156)/39.\n\nSo, y = [\u221a30 (x -156)] /39.\n\nHmm. Now, we can substitute this into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2: y\u00b2 - (40/13)x =480.\n\nSo, [\u221a30 (x -156)/39]^2 - (40/13)x =480.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute y\u00b2:\n\n[\u221a30 (x -156)/39]^2 = (30 (x -156)^2 )/(39^2) = (30 (x -156)^2 )/(1521).\n\nSimplify 30/1521: 30 divides by 3, 1521 \u00f73=507. So, 10/507.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = (10 (x -156)^2 )/507.\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes:\n\n(10 (x -156)^2 )/507 - (40/13)x =480.\n\nMultiply both sides by 507 to eliminate denominators:\n\n10(x -156)^2 - (40/13)x *507 =480*507.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 10(x -156)^2.\n\nSecond term: (40/13)*507 x =40*(507/13) x. 507 \u00f713=39, so 40*39=1560. So, second term is -1560x.\n\nThird term: 480*507. Let me compute that.\n\nCompute 500*507=253,500, and 80*507=40,560. So total is 253,500 +40,560=294,060.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n10(x\u00b2 - 312x +156\u00b2) -1560x =294,060.\n\nCompute 156\u00b2: 156*156.\n\n150\u00b2=22500, 6\u00b2=36, 2*150*6=1800. So, (150+6)^2=150\u00b2 +2*150*6 +6\u00b2=22500 +1800 +36=24336.\n\nSo, 10(x\u00b2 -312x +24336) -1560x =294,060.\n\nExpand:\n\n10x\u00b2 -3120x +243,360 -1560x =294,060.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n10x\u00b2 - (3120 +1560)x +243,360 =294,060.\n\nWhich is 10x\u00b2 -4680x +243,360 =294,060.\n\nSubtract 294,060 from both sides:\n\n10x\u00b2 -4680x +243,360 -294,060 =0.\n\nCompute 243,360 -294,060: that's -50,700.\n\nSo, 10x\u00b2 -4680x -50,700 =0.\n\nDivide both sides by 10 to simplify:\n\nx\u00b2 -468x -5,070 =0.\n\nSo, quadratic equation: x\u00b2 -468x -5,070 =0.\n\nWait, that seems a bit large. Let me check my calculations.\n\nWait, when I multiplied both sides by 507, I had:\n\n10(x -156)^2 -1560x =294,060.\n\nBut perhaps I made an error in the expansion. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the first term is 10(x -156)^2, which is 10*(x\u00b2 - 312x +24336) =10x\u00b2 -3120x +243360.\n\nThen, subtracting 1560x: so 10x\u00b2 -3120x -1560x +243360 =10x\u00b2 -4680x +243360.\n\nThen, setting equal to 294,060: 10x\u00b2 -4680x +243360 =294,060.\n\nSubtract 294,060: 10x\u00b2 -4680x -50,700 =0.\n\nDivide by 10: x\u00b2 -468x -5,070 =0.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, solving x\u00b2 -468x -5,070 =0.\n\nWe can use quadratic formula. x = [468 \u00b1 sqrt(468\u00b2 +4*5070)] /2.\n\nCompute discriminant D =468\u00b2 +4*5070.\n\nCompute 468\u00b2: 468*468.\n\nLet me compute 400\u00b2=160,000, 68\u00b2=4,624, 2*400*68=54,400.\n\nSo, (400+68)^2=400\u00b2 +2*400*68 +68\u00b2=160,000 +54,400 +4,624=219,024.\n\nThen, 4*5070=20,280.\n\nSo, D=219,024 +20,280=239,304.\n\nNow, sqrt(239,304). Let me see: 489\u00b2=239,121, because 500\u00b2=250,000, so 489\u00b2= (500 -11)^2=500\u00b2 -2*500*11 +11\u00b2=250,000 -11,000 +121=239,121.\n\nWait, 489\u00b2=239,121. So, 489\u00b2 +183=239,304.\n\nWait, 489\u00b2=239,121, so 489\u00b2 +183=239,304.\n\nHmm, but 183 is not a perfect square. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, 239,304 divided by 16 is 14,956.5, which is not integer. Maybe it's a square of some number.\n\nWait, let me try 489. Let me compute 489\u00b2= (490 -1)^2=490\u00b2 -2*490 +1=240,100 -980 +1=239,121.\n\nSo, 489\u00b2=239,121. Then, 490\u00b2=240,100. So, 239,304 is between 489\u00b2 and 490\u00b2.\n\nSo, sqrt(239,304)=489 + (239,304-239,121)/(2*489 +1).\n\nSo, 239,304-239,121=183. So, sqrt(239,304)=489 +183/(978 +1)=489 +183/979\u2248489 +0.186\u2248489.186. Hmm, but that's not an integer. So, perhaps my approach has an error.\n\nWait, maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nLet me retrace my steps.\n\nWe had equation 1: (x\u221a30)/13 =12\u221a30 +3y.\n\nI solved for y and got y = [\u221a30 (x -156)] /39.\n\nThen, equation 2: y\u00b2 - (40/13)x =480.\n\nSubstituted y and squared, leading to a quadratic in x.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in expanding (x -156)^2.\n\nWait, (x -156)^2 =x\u00b2 - 2*156x +156\u00b2= x\u00b2 -312x +24336.\n\nSo, 10*(x\u00b2 -312x +24336)=10x\u00b2 -3120x +243,360.\n\nThen, subtracting 1560x: 10x\u00b2 -3120x -1560x +243,360=10x\u00b2 -4680x +243,360.\n\nSet equal to 294,060.\n\n10x\u00b2 -4680x +243,360=294,060.\n\nSubtract 294,060: 10x\u00b2 -4680x -50,700=0.\n\nDivide by 10: x\u00b2 -468x -5,070=0.\n\nQuadratic equation: x\u00b2 -468x -5,070=0.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor this, but 468 and 5070 are large numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor 5,070 to find possible roots.\n\nWait, 5,070 divided by 10 is 507. 507=13*39=13*13*3.\n\nSo, 5,070=2*3*5*13\u00b2.\n\nHmm, perhaps the quadratic can be factored as (x - a)(x + b)=0, where a and b are numbers such that a*b=5,070 and a -b=468.\n\nWait, but 5,070 is positive, and a - b=468, but a*b=5,070. Hmm, but if a and b are positive, then a would be larger than b, so a - b=468, and a*b=5,070.\n\nBut 5,070 is less than 468^2, which is 219,024. So, it's possible.\n\nBut factoring might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the quadratic formula.\n\nSo, x = [468 \u00b1 sqrt(468\u00b2 +4*5,070)] /2.\n\nWait, wait, the quadratic is x\u00b2 -468x -5,070=0. So, a=1, b=-468, c=-5,070.\n\nSo, discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac= (-468)^2 -4*1*(-5,070)=468\u00b2 +4*5,070.\n\nWait, earlier I computed 468\u00b2=219,024, and 4*5,070=20,280. So, D=219,024 +20,280=239,304.\n\nHmm, same as before.\n\nSo, sqrt(239,304). Let me see: 489\u00b2=239,121, 490\u00b2=240,100. So, it's between 489 and 490.\n\nWait, 239,304 -239,121=183. So, sqrt(239,304)=489 +183/(2*489 +1)=489 +183/979\u2248489.186.\n\nBut that's not an integer, which is a problem because x is bc, which should be an integer perhaps, or at least a rational number. So, maybe I made a mistake earlier in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in equation 1. Let me check.\n\nEquation 1: bc*(\u221a30 /13 ) =3*(4\u221a30 + b + c).\n\nWait, from earlier steps, equation 1 came from \u0394 = (1/2) bc sin A =6*s.\n\nAnd sin A =2\u221a30 /13, so (1/2) bc*(2\u221a30 /13)= (bc\u221a30)/13.\n\nAnd 6*s=6*(a +b +c)/2=3*(a +b +c)=3*(4\u221a30 +b +c).\n\nSo, equation 1 is correct.\n\nEquation 2: a\u00b2=480= b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nThat came from the Law of Cosines: a\u00b2 =b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A, and cos A=7/13, so 2bc cos A= (14/13) bc.\n\nSo, equation 2 is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the quadratic is correct, and x is not an integer. So, I'll proceed with the quadratic formula.\n\nx = [468 \u00b1 sqrt(239,304)] /2.\n\nWe can write sqrt(239,304)=sqrt(16*14,956.5). Wait, no, 239,304 divided by 16 is 14,956.5, which is not integer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's divisible by 4: 239,304 /4=59,826. 59,826 /2=29,913. Hmm, 29,913 divided by 3 is 9,971. So, 239,304=4*2*3*9,971=24*9,971.\n\nWait, 9,971 is a prime? Maybe. Hmm, perhaps not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write sqrt(239,304)=sqrt(239,304)=489.186 as before.\n\nBut maybe I can keep it symbolic for now.\n\nSo, x= [468 \u00b1489.186 ] /2.\n\nSo, two solutions:\n\nx=(468 +489.186)/2= (957.186)/2\u2248478.593\n\nx=(468 -489.186)/2= (-21.186)/2\u2248-10.593.\n\nSince x=bc is positive, we take the positive solution, x\u2248478.593.\n\nHmm, but bc is approximately 478.593. But since the problem asks for AB\u00b7AC= c\u00b7b= x, which is this value.\n\nBut the problem is expecting an integer, probably. So, maybe my earlier approach has a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for IA.\n\nWait, I assumed IA = r / sin(A/2). Is that correct?\n\nWait, let me recall: in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be found using the formula IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)).\n\nYes, that's correct. So, IA = r / sin(A/2).\n\nSo, that part was correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify the formula for IA. I think it's IA = 2R sin(A/2 + 45\u00b0) or something, but maybe I'm confusing it with another formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for another formula for IA.\n\nWait, another formula for IA is IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)).\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, IA can be expressed as sqrt(R(R - 2r_A)), where r_A is the exradius opposite A. Wait, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use coordinates.\n\nLet me consider placing the triangle in coordinate system to model the problem.\n\nLet me place point I at the origin (0,0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and O is the circumradius center. Wait, but O is the circumradius center, which is not necessarily at the origin.\n\nWait, maybe I can set up coordinates such that I is at (0,0), and O lies along the x-axis.\n\nSo, let me set I at (0,0), and O at (d, 0), where d is the distance OI.\n\nWe know OI = sqrt(13), so d = sqrt(13).\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is along the x-axis, IA must be along the y-axis.\n\nSo, point A is somewhere along the y-axis. Let me denote point A as (0, a), where a is the length IA.\n\nFrom earlier, we have IA =2\u221a39, so point A is (0, 2\u221a39).\n\nWait, but wait, if I is at (0,0), and IA is perpendicular to OI, then O is at (sqrt(13),0), and A is at (0,2\u221a39).\n\nNow, the circumradius is 13, so the circumcircle has center at (sqrt(13),0) and radius 13.\n\nSo, point A lies on this circumcircle. Let's check the distance from O to A.\n\nDistance OA: sqrt( (sqrt(13) -0)^2 + (0 -2\u221a39)^2 )= sqrt(13 + 4*39)= sqrt(13 +156)=sqrt(169)=13, which matches the circumradius.\n\nGood, that checks out.\n\nNow, the triangle ABC has incenter at I=(0,0), and circumcenter at O=(sqrt(13),0). Point A is at (0,2\u221a39).\n\nWe need to find the coordinates of points B and C such that I is the incenter.\n\nHmm, this might be a bit involved, but perhaps we can find the coordinates of B and C.\n\nLet me denote points B and C as (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), respectively.\n\nSince I is the incenter, it lies at the intersection of the angle bisectors. The coordinates of the incenter can be found using the formula:\n\nI = (aA + bB + cC)/(a + b + c),\n\nwhere a, b, c are the lengths of the sides opposite angles A, B, C, respectively.\n\nBut in our case, I is at (0,0), so:\n\n( a*A + b*B + c*C ) / (a + b + c ) = (0,0).\n\nSo,\n\na*A + b*B + c*C = (0,0).\n\nBut this seems complicated because we don't know a, b, c.\n\nAlternatively, since I is the incenter, the distances from I to each side are equal to r=6.\n\nSo, the distance from I=(0,0) to side BC is 6.\n\nSimilarly, the distance from I to AB and AC is 6.\n\nBut since we have point A at (0,2\u221a39), and I at (0,0), the distance from I to AB and AC can be calculated.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the inradius in terms of coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find equations of sides AB and AC.\n\nWait, since point A is at (0,2\u221a39), and incenter I is at (0,0), the angle bisector of angle A goes through I. So, the line AI is the angle bisector of angle A.\n\nSince AI is along the y-axis (from (0,2\u221a39) to (0,0)), the angle bisector is the y-axis.\n\nSo, the sides AB and AC are symmetric with respect to the y-axis.\n\nWait, because the angle bisector is the y-axis, so the triangle is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. So, points B and C are symmetric across the y-axis.\n\nSo, if point B is at (x, y), then point C is at (-x, y).\n\nWait, but since I is the incenter at (0,0), which is on the y-axis, and O is at (sqrt(13),0), which is on the x-axis, the triangle is not symmetric with respect to the x-axis, but perhaps symmetric with respect to the y-axis.\n\nWait, if the triangle is symmetric across the y-axis, then sides AB and AC would be mirror images.\n\nSo, point B is at (x, y) and point C is at (-x, y). Then, side BC is horizontal, from (-x,y) to (x,y), so midpoint at (0,y), which is on the y-axis.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nSo, let's denote point B as (x, y) and point C as (-x, y).\n\nSo, the coordinates are:\n\nA: (0, 2\u221a39)\n\nB: (x, y)\n\nC: (-x, y)\n\nO: (\u221a13, 0)\n\nI: (0,0)\n\nNow, since O is the circumcenter, all points A, B, C are at distance 13 from O.\n\nSo, distance from O to A: sqrt( (sqrt(13)-0)^2 + (0 -2\u221a39)^2 )=sqrt(13 + 4*39)=sqrt(13+156)=sqrt(169)=13. Correct.\n\nDistance from O to B: sqrt( (sqrt(13)-x)^2 + (0 - y)^2 )=13.\n\nSimilarly, distance from O to C: same as B, since C is (-x,y).\n\nSo, equation for point B:\n\n( sqrt(13) - x )\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =13\u00b2=169.\n\nSimilarly, point A is (0, 2\u221a39), so the triangle has vertices at these points.\n\nNow, the inradius is 6, and I is at (0,0). The inradius is the distance from I to each side.\n\nSo, the distance from I=(0,0) to side BC is 6.\n\nSide BC is the line joining points B=(x,y) and C=(-x,y). So, the equation of BC is y = y_coordinate, since it's a horizontal line.\n\nWait, points B and C are (x,y) and (-x,y), so the line BC is y = y.\n\nSo, the distance from I=(0,0) to line BC is |0 - y| / sqrt(0\u00b2 +1\u00b2) )= | -y | = |y|.\n\nSo, |y|=6. Since y is positive (as point A is above the x-axis and the triangle is above the x-axis), y=6.\n\nSo, y=6.\n\nSo, points B and C are (x,6) and (-x,6).\n\nSo, now we can update the equation for point B:\n\n( sqrt(13) - x )\u00b2 +6\u00b2 =169.\n\nCompute:\n\n( sqrt(13) -x )\u00b2 +36 =169.\n\nSo, ( sqrt(13) -x )\u00b2 =133.\n\nTake square root:\n\nsqrt(13) -x = \u00b1sqrt(133).\n\nSo, x= sqrt(13) \u2213 sqrt(133).\n\nBut x must be real. Let me compute sqrt(133): approximately 11.532.\n\nsqrt(13)\u22483.606.\n\nSo, x=3.606 -11.532\u2248-7.926, or x=3.606 +11.532\u224815.138.\n\nBut since point B is at (x,6), and the triangle is symmetric across the y-axis, x can be positive or negative, but since we've already considered B and C as (x,6) and (-x,6), perhaps we take x as positive.\n\nSo, x= sqrt(13) + sqrt(133). Wait, but sqrt(133) is larger than sqrt(13), so x would be positive.\n\nWait, but let me compute ( sqrt(13) -x )\u00b2 =133.\n\nSo, sqrt(13) -x = sqrt(133) => x= sqrt(13) - sqrt(133). That would be negative, which would place B at negative x, but since we have C at (-x,6), perhaps it's better to take x= sqrt(13) + sqrt(133).\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nIf sqrt(13) -x = sqrt(133), then x= sqrt(13) - sqrt(133). Since sqrt(133) > sqrt(13), x would be negative, which would place B at (-|x|,6), but since C is at (-x,6), perhaps it's better to take the positive solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.\n\nWait, equation: ( sqrt(13) -x )\u00b2 =133.\n\nSo, sqrt(13) -x = \u00b1sqrt(133).\n\nSo, x= sqrt(13) \u2213 sqrt(133).\n\nSo, x could be sqrt(13) + sqrt(133) or sqrt(13) - sqrt(133).\n\nBut sqrt(13) is about 3.605, sqrt(133)=11.532.\n\nSo, x=3.605 -11.532\u2248-7.927, or x=3.605 +11.532\u224815.137.\n\nSo, point B is at (15.137,6) or (-7.927,6). But since we have C at (-x,6), if x is positive, then C would be at (-15.137,6). Alternatively, if x is negative, C would be at (7.927,6).\n\nBut the triangle should have all three points, so perhaps taking x positive is better.\n\nSo, let's take x= sqrt(13) + sqrt(133).\n\nWait, but sqrt(13) + sqrt(133)=approx 3.605 +11.532=15.137, as above.\n\nSo, point B is at (15.137,6), and point C is at (-15.137,6).\n\nWait, but then side BC would be from (-15.137,6) to (15.137,6), which is a horizontal line 30.274 units long. Hmm, but let's compute the exact value.\n\nWait, the length BC is 2x, since B is at (x,6) and C at (-x,6). So, BC=2x.\n\nBut earlier, we found that a= BC=4\u221a30\u224821.908.\n\nSo, 2x=4\u221a30 =>x=2\u221a30\u224810.954.\n\nBut according to our earlier calculation, x= sqrt(13)+sqrt(133)=approx 15.137, which is larger than 2\u221a30\u224810.954. So, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that the triangle is symmetric about the y-axis. Wait, is that necessarily true?\n\nWait, because AI is the angle bisector, which we've placed along the y-axis, but the triangle's other sides may not necessarily be symmetric about the y-axis. Wait, but in our setup, with O at (sqrt(13),0), I at (0,0), and A at (0,2\u221a39), perhaps the triangle is not symmetric. Hmm, maybe I made an error in assuming symmetry.\n\nWait, perhaps I shouldn't assume symmetry. Let me try a different approach.\n\nGiven that the incenter is at (0,0), the circumradius center at (sqrt(13),0), and point A at (0,2\u221a39). Let's find the coordinates of points B and C.\n\nWe know that points B and C lie on the circumcircle centered at (sqrt(13),0) with radius 13. So, their coordinates satisfy:\n\n(x - sqrt(13))\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =169.\n\nAdditionally, the inradius is 6, so the distance from I=(0,0) to each side is 6.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the inradius in terms of coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the equations of sides AB and AC, knowing that the distance from I=(0,0) to each is 6.\n\nPoint A is at (0,2\u221a39). Let me denote points B and C as (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).\n\nThe equation of line AB can be found using points A and B.\n\nThe general equation of line AB is: (y - 2\u221a39) = m1 (x - 0), where m1 is the slope.\n\nSimilarly, the distance from I=(0,0) to line AB is 6.\n\nThe distance from a point (x0,y0) to the line ax + by +c=0 is |ax0 + by0 +c| / sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2).\n\nSo, let's write the equation of AB in standard form.\n\nLine AB passes through (0,2\u221a39) and (x1,y1). Its equation can be written as:\n\n(y - 2\u221a39) = (y1 - 2\u221a39)/x1 * x.\n\nMultiplying both sides by x1:\n\nx1(y - 2\u221a39) = (y1 - 2\u221a39) x.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n(y1 - 2\u221a39)x -x1 y + 2\u221a39 x1=0.\n\nSo, the standard form is:\n\n(y1 - 2\u221a39)x -x1 y + 2\u221a39 x1=0.\n\nThe distance from (0,0) to this line is:\n\n| (y1 - 2\u221a39)*0 -x1*0 +2\u221a39 x1 | / sqrt( (y1 - 2\u221a39)^2 + (-x1)^2 ) = |2\u221a39 x1| / sqrt( (y1 - 2\u221a39)^2 +x1\u00b2 ) =6.\n\nSo,\n\n|2\u221a39 x1| / sqrt( (y1 - 2\u221a39)^2 +x1\u00b2 )=6.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(4*39 x1\u00b2 ) / ( (y1 - 2\u221a39)^2 +x1\u00b2 )=36.\n\nSimplify numerator:4*39=156.\n\nSo,\n\n156 x1\u00b2 =36 [ (y1 - 2\u221a39)^2 +x1\u00b2 ].\n\nDivide both sides by 12:\n\n13 x1\u00b2 =3 [ (y1 - 2\u221a39)^2 +x1\u00b2 ].\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n13x1\u00b2=3(y1\u00b2 -4\u221a39 y1 + 4*39) +3x1\u00b2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n13x1\u00b2=3y1\u00b2 -12\u221a39 y1 + 507 +3x1\u00b2.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n13x1\u00b2 -3x1\u00b2 -3y1\u00b2 +12\u221a39 y1 -507=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n10x1\u00b2 -3y1\u00b2 +12\u221a39 y1 -507=0.\n\nHmm, that's a complicated equation.\n\nBut we also know that point B lies on the circumcircle, so:\n\n(x1 - sqrt(13))\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 =169.\n\nExpanding:\n\nx1\u00b2 -2 sqrt(13) x1 +13 + y1\u00b2=169.\n\nSo,\n\nx1\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 -2 sqrt(13) x1 =156.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) 10x1\u00b2 -3y1\u00b2 +12\u221a39 y1 -507=0.\n\n2) x1\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 -2 sqrt(13) x1 =156.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can solve these two equations together.\n\nLet me denote equation 2 as:\n\nx1\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 =156 +2 sqrt(13) x1.\n\nLet me express x1\u00b2 from equation 2:\n\nx1\u00b2=156 +2 sqrt(13) x1 - y1\u00b2.\n\nNow, substitute x1\u00b2 into equation 1.\n\nEquation 1:\n\n10x1\u00b2 -3y1\u00b2 +12\u221a39 y1 -507=0.\n\nSubstitute x1\u00b2:\n\n10*(156 +2 sqrt(13) x1 - y1\u00b2) -3y1\u00b2 +12\u221a39 y1 -507=0.\n\nCompute:\n\n10*156=1560,\n\n10*2 sqrt(13) x1=20 sqrt(13) x1,\n\n10*(-y1\u00b2)= -10y1\u00b2,\n\nSo,\n\n1560 +20 sqrt(13) x1 -10y1\u00b2 -3y1\u00b2 +12\u221a39 y1 -507=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1560 -507=1053,\n\n20 sqrt(13) x1,\n\n-10y1\u00b2 -3y1\u00b2= -13y1\u00b2,\n\n+12\u221a39 y1.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n1053 +20 sqrt(13) x1 -13y1\u00b2 +12\u221a39 y1=0.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can express y1 in terms of x1 from equation 2.\n\nWait, from equation 2: x1\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 =156 +2 sqrt(13) x1.\n\nLet me solve for y1\u00b2:\n\ny1\u00b2=156 +2 sqrt(13) x1 -x1\u00b2.\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\n1053 +20 sqrt(13) x1 -13*(156 +2 sqrt(13) x1 -x1\u00b2 ) +12\u221a39 y1=0.\n\nCompute term by term:\n\n-13*(156)= -2028,\n\n-13*(2 sqrt(13) x1)= -26 sqrt(13) x1,\n\n-13*(-x1\u00b2)=13x1\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n1053 +20 sqrt(13) x1 -2028 -26 sqrt(13) x1 +13x1\u00b2 +12\u221a39 y1=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1053 -2028= -975,\n\n20 sqrt(13) x1 -26 sqrt(13) x1= -6 sqrt(13) x1,\n\n+13x1\u00b2,\n\n+12\u221a39 y1.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n13x1\u00b2 -6 sqrt(13) x1 -975 +12\u221a39 y1=0.\n\nHmm, not helpful. Maybe I can express y1 in terms of x1 from equation 2.\n\nWait, from equation 2: y1\u00b2=156 +2 sqrt(13) x1 -x1\u00b2.\n\nBut that's a square, so y1= sqrt(156 +2 sqrt(13) x1 -x1\u00b2). But that's messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a relationship between x1 and y1.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is too complicated. Maybe I should go back to the earlier approach with the quadratic equation.\n\nEarlier, we had x\u2248478.593, which is bc\u2248478.593.\n\nBut the problem asks for AB\u00b7AC= bc, so perhaps the answer is approximately 478.593, but since it's an integer, maybe it's 480? But 478.593 is close to 480, but not exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check.\n\nWait, when I set up the quadratic equation, perhaps I made a mistake in the coefficients.\n\nLet me go back to the two equations:\n\n1) (x\u221a30)/13 =12\u221a30 +3y.\n\n2) y\u00b2 - (40/13)x =480.\n\nWe found y= [\u221a30 (x -156)] /39.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, equation 1: (x\u221a30)/13 =12\u221a30 +3y.\n\nSo, 3y= (x\u221a30)/13 -12\u221a30.\n\nSo, y= [ (x\u221a30)/13 -12\u221a30 ] /3.\n\nFactor out \u221a30:\n\ny= \u221a30 [x/(13) -12 ] /3.\n\nWhich is y= \u221a30 (x - 156)/(39).\n\nSo, y= [\u221a30 (x -156)] /39.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nThen, equation 2: y\u00b2 - (40/13)x =480.\n\nSubstitute y:\n\n[\u221a30 (x -156)/39]^2 - (40/13)x =480.\n\nCompute:\n\n(30 (x -156)^2 )/(39^2) - (40/13)x =480.\n\n39^2=1521.\n\nSo, 30/1521=10/507.\n\nSo, [10 (x -156)^2 ]/507 - (40/13)x =480.\n\nMultiply both sides by 507:\n\n10(x -156)^2 - (40/13)x *507=480*507.\n\nCompute:\n\n(40/13)*507=40*39=1560.\n\nSo, 10(x\u00b2 -312x +24336) -1560x =294,060.\n\nSo,\n\n10x\u00b2 -3120x +243360 -1560x =294,060.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n10x\u00b2 -4680x +243360 =294,060.\n\nSubtract 294,060:\n\n10x\u00b2 -4680x -50,700=0.\n\nDivide by 10:\n\nx\u00b2 -468x -5,070=0.\n\nQuadratic equation: x\u00b2 -468x -5,070=0.\n\nSo, discriminant D=468\u00b2 +4*5,070=219,024 +20,280=239,304.\n\nSo, sqrt(239,304)= approx 489.186.\n\nSo, x=(468 +489.186)/2=957.186/2\u2248478.593.\n\nHmm, so x\u2248478.593.\n\nBut wait, earlier I found that a= BC=4\u221a30\u224821.908, and the semi-perimeter s=(a +b +c)/2.\n\nBut since b and c are sides AB and AC, and their product is x\u2248478.593, perhaps we can find AB and AC individually.\n\nWait, but the problem only asks for AB\u00b7AC, which is x. So, perhaps the answer is 478.593, but since the problem likely expects an integer, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe the answer is 480, as it's close to 478.593, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I can check using another formula.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the product AB\u00b7AC can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles.\n\nWait, since AB=c, AC=b, then AB\u00b7AC= bc.\n\nWe also know that from the Law of Cosines: a\u00b2 =b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nWe have a=4\u221a30, so a\u00b2=480.\n\ncos A=7/13.\n\nSo, 480 =b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nAnd from the area formula: bc sin A = 2\u0394.\n\nAnd \u0394= r*s=6s.\n\nBut s=(a +b +c)/2.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps we can express b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 in terms of bc.\n\nFrom equation:480 =b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nb\u00b2 +c\u00b2=480 + (14/13) bc.\n\nBut also, we know that (b +c)^2 =b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 +2bc.\n\nSo, (b +c)^2= [480 + (14/13) bc ] + 2bc=480 + (14/13 + 26/13 ) bc=480 + (40/13) bc.\n\nSo, (b +c)^2=480 + (40/13) bc.\n\nBut from the earlier equation, we have s=(a +b +c)/2=(4\u221a30 +b +c)/2.\n\nAnd from the area: \u0394=6s= (bc\u221a30)/13.\n\nSo, 6*(4\u221a30 +b +c)/2= (bc\u221a30)/13.\n\nSimplify: 3*(4\u221a30 +b +c)= (bc\u221a30)/13.\n\nSo, 12\u221a30 +3b +3c= (bc\u221a30)/13.\n\nMultiply both sides by13:\n\n156\u221a30 +39b +39c= bc\u221a30.\n\nRearranged: bc\u221a30 -39b -39c=156\u221a30.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor this equation.\n\nAlternatively, let me factor b and c.\n\nbc\u221a30 -39b -39c=156\u221a30.\n\nAdd 39\u00b2 to both sides to complete the rectangle.\n\nSo, bc\u221a30 -39b -39c + (39)^2=156\u221a30 + (39)^2.\n\nSo, (b -39)(c -39)\u221a30=156\u221a30 + 1521.\n\nWait, but this might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can let u =b +c, v= bc.\n\nThen, from the equation:\n\nv\u221a30/13 =12\u221a30 +3u.\n\nWhich gives:\n\nv\u221a30 =156\u221a30 +39u.\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a30:\n\nv=156 + (39u)/\u221a30.\n\nBut that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, from the equation:\n\nv\u221a30 -39u=156\u221a30.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express u in terms of v.\n\nWait, earlier we had (b +c)^2=480 + (40/13)v.\n\nSo, u\u00b2=480 + (40/13)v.\n\nSo, u= sqrt(480 + (40/13)v).\n\nBut this might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can substitute u from one equation into another.\n\nWait, from equation 1: v\u221a30/13 =12\u221a30 +3u.\n\nSo, 3u= v\u221a30/13 -12\u221a30.\n\nSo, u= (v\u221a30 -156\u221a30 )/(39).\n\nWhich is u= [\u221a30 (v -156)] /39.\n\nThen, from equation 2: u\u00b2=480 + (40/13)v.\n\nSubstituting u:\n\n[\u221a30 (v -156)/39]^2 =480 + (40/13)v.\n\nCompute left side:\n\n(30 (v -156)^2 )/(39^2 )= (30/1521)(v -156)^2= (10/507)(v -156)^2.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(10/507)(v -156)^2 =480 + (40/13)v.\n\nMultiply both sides by 507 to eliminate denominator:\n\n10(v -156)^2 =480*507 + (40/13)v *507.\n\nCompute:\n\n480*507=243,360.\n\n(40/13)*507=40*39=1560.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n10(v\u00b2 - 312v +156\u00b2 )=243,360 +1560v.\n\nCompute 156\u00b2=24,336.\n\nSo,\n\n10v\u00b2 -3120v +243,360=243,360 +1560v.\n\nSubtract 243,360 from both sides:\n\n10v\u00b2 -3120v =1560v.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n10v\u00b2 -3120v -1560v=0.\n\nSo,\n\n10v\u00b2 -4680v=0.\n\nFactor:\n\n10v(v -468)=0.\n\nSo, solutions v=0 or v=468.\n\nSince v=bc is positive, v=468.\n\nSo, bc=468.\n\nWait, this contradicts our earlier result of approximately 478.593.\n\nHmm, so where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in this approach, I set u =b +c and v= bc.\n\nFrom equation 1, I derived u= [\u221a30 (v -156)] /39.\n\nThen, from equation 2, I used u\u00b2=480 + (40/13)v.\n\nSubstituting u gave me a quadratic equation leading to v=468.\n\nBut earlier, when I set up the equations with x= bc, I got x\u2248478.593.\n\nBut this approach gives bc=468.\n\nHmm, but 468 is an integer, which is more plausible.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is 468.\n\nWait, but why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake earlier in the setup.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I set x= bc and y= b +c, leading to a quadratic equation with solution x\u2248478.593, but perhaps that approach had an error.\n\nIn the second approach, by letting u= b +c and v= bc, I arrived at v=468, which is an integer and more likely the correct answer.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is 468.\n\nWait, but let me verify.\n\nIf bc=468, then from equation 1: v\u221a30 /13 =12\u221a30 +3u.\n\nSo, 468\u221a30 /13 =12\u221a30 +3u.\n\nCompute 468/13=36, so 36\u221a30=12\u221a30 +3u.\n\nSo, 36\u221a30 -12\u221a30=3u =>24\u221a30=3u =>u=8\u221a30.\n\nSo, u=8\u221a30.\n\nSo, b +c=8\u221a30.\n\nThen, from equation 2: u\u00b2=480 + (40/13)v.\n\nu\u00b2= (8\u221a30)^2=64*30=1920.\n\nSo, 1920=480 + (40/13)*468.\n\nCompute (40/13)*468=40*(468/13)=40*36=1440.\n\nSo, 480 +1440=1920, which matches.\n\nSo, this approach is correct, leading to bc=468.\n\nEarlier, the first approach must have had an error, perhaps in the setup of the equations.\n\nTherefore, the correct value of AB\u00b7AC= bc=468.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the circumradius \\( R = 13 \\) and the inradius \\( r = 6 \\). The condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) implies that triangle \\( IOA \\) is right-angled at \\( I \\).

Using the Law of Cosines:\n\\[\na^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A \\implies 480 = b^2 + c^2 - \\frac{14}{13}bc.\n\\]\n\nThe area \\( \\Delta \\) of the triangle can be expressed as \\( \\Delta = r \\cdot s \\) where \\( s \\) is the semi-perimeter, and also as \\( \\Delta = \\frac{1}{2} bc \\sin A \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:\n\nLet triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, circumradius 13, and inradius 6. Find AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nHmm, okay. So, triangle ABC, with O as the circumcenter and I as the incenter. IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, which is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle. The inradius is 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle.\n\nWe need to find the product of AB and AC. So, AB times AC. That is, the lengths of sides AB and AC multiplied together.\n\nLet me recall some properties and formulas related to triangle centers and their relationships.\n\nFirst, the circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle. For any triangle, the formula is R = (a)/(2 sin A), where a is the side opposite angle A. Similarly, R = b/(2 sin B) and R = c/(2 sin C). Since the circumradius is 13, that's given.\n\nThe inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter. The formula is r = area / s, where s is the semiperimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2. Given that r is 6, so area = r * s = 6s.\n\nAlso, there are relationships between the inradius, circumradius, and other elements like the distance between the incenter and circumradius. The formula for the distance OI (where O is circumcenter and I is incenter) is OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that correct? Let me think.\n\nYes, Euler's formula states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). So, plugging the given values, R =13, r=6, so OI\u00b2 = 13(13 - 12) = 13(1) =13. So OI = sqrt(13).\n\nWait, but the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, that's an important condition. So the line from I to A is perpendicular to the line from O to I.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. So in triangle ABC, O is the circumcenter, I is the incenter. The line IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nHmm, maybe I can use coordinate geometry here. Let me try to set up a coordinate system.\n\nLet me place point I at the origin (0,0) to simplify calculations. Then, the line OI is from I(0,0) to O somewhere. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and point A is somewhere in the plane.\n\nWait, but if I is at (0,0), and O is at some point, say (h, k), then OI is the vector (h, k). IA is the vector from I(0,0) to A(x, y), which is (x, y). The condition is that IA is perpendicular to OI, so their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, (x)(h) + (y)(k) = 0. Hmm, that's one condition.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use vector geometry or properties of triangle centers.\n\nWait, another approach: In triangle ABC, since IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps we can relate the lengths of IA and OI with some trigonometric identities.\n\nWait, IA is the length from incenter I to vertex A. The formula for the length of the inradius is known, but IA is not the inradius, it's the distance from I to A.\n\nWait, the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex is given by IA = r / sin(A/2), where r is the inradius. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is IA = r / sin(A/2). Similarly, IB = r / sin(B/2), IC = r / sin(C/2).\n\nSo, IA = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nSimilarly, the distance OI is sqrt(13), as we calculated earlier.\n\nGiven that IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps we can consider the triangle formed by points O, I, and A. So, triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at I.\n\nWait, no. The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI, which is the line OI. So, the lines IA and OI are perpendicular, meaning that at the point where IA meets OI, which is at I, the angle is 90 degrees. So, triangle OIA is right-angled at I.\n\nTherefore, triangle OIA is a right triangle with right angle at I. So, by Pythagoras' theorem, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nBut OA is the distance from O to A, which is the circumradius, so OA = R =13.\n\nSo, OA\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169.\n\nOI\u00b2 we already found as 13, so OI = sqrt(13). So, OI\u00b2 =13.\n\nIA\u00b2 is (IA)^2. Since IA is 6 / sin(A/2), IA\u00b2 = 36 / sin\u00b2(A/2).\n\nTherefore, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2:\n\n169 = 13 + (36 / sin\u00b2(A/2)).\n\nSo, 169 -13 = 36 / sin\u00b2(A/2).\n\n156 = 36 / sin\u00b2(A/2).\n\nTherefore, sin\u00b2(A/2) = 36 /156 = 3/13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13). Because A is an angle in a triangle, so A/2 is between 0 and 90 degrees, so sine is positive.\n\nThus, sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13). So, cos(A/2) can be found using the identity sin\u00b2x + cos\u00b2x =1.\n\nSo, cos\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 3/13 = 10/13.\n\nThus, cos(A/2) = sqrt(10/13).\n\nNow, we can find some other trigonometric functions related to angle A.\n\nWe know that in triangle ABC, the area is r*s =6s, where s is semiperimeter.\n\nAlso, area can be expressed as (1/2)*ab*sin C, but perhaps more useful here is the formula involving the inradius and semiperimeter.\n\nAlternatively, the area can also be expressed using the formula:\n\nArea = (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides, and R is the circumradius.\n\nBut we need to find AB \u00b7 AC. Let's denote AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a, following the standard notation where a is opposite angle A, etc.\n\nWait, no, actually, in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. So, AB is c, AC is b, BC is a.\n\nSo, we're to find AB \u00b7 AC = c * b.\n\nSo, the product of sides AB and AC is c*b.\n\nWe can express the area in terms of the inradius: Area = r*s =6s.\n\nAlso, Area = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a*b*c)/52 \u2192 a*b*c = 6*52*s = 312 s.\n\nHmm, but we might need more relations to find c*b.\n\nWait, perhaps we can use the formula for the length of IA, which we have.\n\nIA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(3/13) = 6 * sqrt(13/3) = 6*sqrt(13)/sqrt(3) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nWait, let me compute that again.\n\nIA = 6 / sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(3/13) = 6 * sqrt(13/3) = 6 * sqrt(13)/sqrt(3) = 6*sqrt(13)*sqrt(3)/3 = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nSo, IA = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nBut in triangle OIA, which is right-angled at I, we have:\n\nOI = sqrt(13), IA = 2*sqrt(39), and OA =13.\n\nSo, as a check, OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = 13 + (4*39) =13 + 156=169=13\u00b2, which matches OA\u00b2, so that's correct.\n\nNow, perhaps I can find angle A or something related.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, the distance from I to A is IA, which is 2*sqrt(39). But I is the inradius, so I is the intersection of the angle bisectors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can relate angle A with the sides.\n\nWe have formulas involving sin(A/2) and cos(A/2). So, let's see.\n\nWe found that sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13), cos(A/2)=sqrt(10/13).\n\nWe can find sin A using the double-angle formula.\n\nsin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(sqrt(3/13))*(sqrt(10/13)) = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSimilarly, cos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(3/13) = 1 - 6/13 =7/13.\n\nSo, cos A =7/13.\n\nHmm, that's useful because in the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13).\n\nBut we're trying to find bc, which is AB \u00b7 AC = c*b.\n\nHmm, so perhaps if I can find expressions involving a, b, c, and use other relations.\n\nAnother formula is the area in terms of inradius: area = r*s =6s.\n\nAlso, area can be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nSo, area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nWe found sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, area = (1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) = (b*c*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nBut area is also 6s, so:\n\n(b*c*sqrt(30))/13 =6s.\n\nSo, b*c = (6s *13)/sqrt(30) = (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, but I don't know s yet. The semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a relation between a, b, c using other formulas.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, the distance from the inradius to vertex A is IA = 2*sqrt(39), which we found earlier.\n\nBut IA can also be expressed in terms of the sides. There's a formula for the length from the incenter to a vertex, which is IA = sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nWait, yes, the formula is IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nSimilarly, IB = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - b)^2), IC = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - c)^2).\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nWe have IA = 2*sqrt(39), so IA\u00b2 = 4*39=156.\n\nSo, 156 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nr is 6, so r\u00b2=36.\n\nSo, 156 =36 + (s - a)^2 \u2192 (s - a)^2=120 \u2192 s - a = sqrt(120)=2*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s - a =2*sqrt(30).\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2, so s - a = ( -a + b + c)/2 = (b + c -a)/2.\n\nSo, (b + c -a)/2 =2*sqrt(30) \u2192 b + c -a =4*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, a = b + c -4*sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, that's an equation relating a, b, c.\n\nWe also know that the area is 6s, and the area is (b c sin A)/2.\n\nWe have sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, area = (b c * (2*sqrt(30)/13))/2 = (b c sqrt(30))/13.\n\nBut area is also 6s, so:\n\n(b c sqrt(30))/13 =6s.\n\nSo, s = (b c sqrt(30))/(6*13) = (b c sqrt(30))/78.\n\nBut s is (a + b + c)/2, so:\n\n(a + b + c)/2 = (b c sqrt(30))/78.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\na + b + c = (2 b c sqrt(30))/78 = (b c sqrt(30))/39.\n\nHmm, but from earlier, we have a = b + c -4*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, substitute a into this equation.\n\nSo, (b + c -4*sqrt(30)) + b + c = (b c sqrt(30))/39.\n\nSimplify left side:\n\nb + c -4\u221a30 + b + c = 2b + 2c -4\u221a30.\n\nSo, 2b + 2c -4\u221a30 = (b c sqrt(30))/39.\n\nLet me factor out 2 on the left:\n\n2(b + c) -4\u221a30 = (b c sqrt(30))/39.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can let x = b + c and y = b c, to simplify.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet x = b + c\n\ny = b c\n\nThen, from a = b + c -4\u221a30, we have a =x -4\u221a30.\n\nWe also have the equation:\n\n2x -4\u221a30 = (y sqrt(30))/39.\n\nSo, 2x -4\u221a30 = (y sqrt(30))/39.\n\nLet me write that as equation (1): 2x -4\u221a30 = (y sqrt(30))/39.\n\nAnother equation comes from the Law of Cosines.\n\nWe have:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2b c cos A.\n\nWe know cos A =7/13, so:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2b c*(7/13).\n\nExpress b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 in terms of x and y.\n\nWe know that (b + c)^2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2b c \u2192 x\u00b2 = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2y \u2192 b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =x\u00b2 -2y.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 -2y) - (14 y)/13.\n\nSimplify:\n\na\u00b2 =x\u00b2 -2y -14y/13 =x\u00b2 - (26y +14y)/13 =x\u00b2 - (40y)/13.\n\nBut a =x -4\u221a30, so a\u00b2= (x -4\u221a30)^2 =x\u00b2 -8x\u221a30 + 16*30 =x\u00b2 -8x\u221a30 +480.\n\nSo, set equal:\n\nx\u00b2 -8x\u221a30 +480 =x\u00b2 - (40y)/13.\n\nSubtract x\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n-8x\u221a30 +480 = - (40y)/13.\n\nMultiply both sides by (-13/40):\n\n(8x\u221a30 *13)/40 - (480*13)/40 = y.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(104x\u221a30)/40 - (6240)/40 = y.\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\n104/40 =26/10=13/5.\n\n6240/40=156.\n\nSo, y= (13/5)x\u221a30 -156.\n\nSo, equation (2): y= (13\u221a30 /5) x -156.\n\nNow, from equation (1):\n\n2x -4\u221a30 = (y sqrt(30))/39.\n\nSubstitute y from equation (2) into equation (1):\n\n2x -4\u221a30 = [ (13\u221a30 /5 x -156 ) * sqrt(30) ] /39.\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\n(13\u221a30 /5 x -156 ) * sqrt(30) = (13\u221a30 * sqrt(30)/5 x ) -156 sqrt(30).\n\nSimplify sqrt(30)*sqrt(30) =30.\n\nSo, numerator becomes:\n\n(13*30/5)x -156 sqrt(30) = (13*6)x -156 sqrt(30)=78x -156 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n2x -4\u221a30 = (78x -156\u221a30)/39.\n\nMultiply both sides by 39 to eliminate denominator:\n\n39*(2x -4\u221a30) =78x -156\u221a30.\n\nCompute left side:\n\n78x -156\u221a30.\n\nRight side:78x -156\u221a30.\n\nSo, 78x -156\u221a30 =78x -156\u221a30.\n\nHmm, this simplifies to 0=0, which is an identity.\n\nThat suggests that equations (1) and (2) are dependent, so we don't get new information from substituting.\n\nSo, perhaps I need another equation.\n\nWait, earlier, we had area =6s= (b c sqrt(30))/13.\n\nBut s = (a +b +c)/2 = (x -4\u221a30 +x)/2 = (2x -4\u221a30)/2 =x -2\u221a30.\n\nSo, s =x -2\u221a30.\n\nSo, area =6s=6(x -2\u221a30).\n\nBut area is also (b c sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, 6(x -2\u221a30) = (y sqrt(30))/13.\n\nBut from equation (2), y= (13\u221a30 /5)x -156.\n\nSo, substitute y into this:\n\n6(x -2\u221a30) = [ (13\u221a30 /5 x -156 ) * sqrt(30) ] /13.\n\nLet me compute the right side:\n\n[ (13\u221a30 /5 x -156 ) * sqrt(30) ] /13.\n\nAgain, multiply numerator:\n\n13\u221a30 /5 x * sqrt(30) =13*(30)/5 x=13*6x=78x.\n\n-156 * sqrt(30) = -156 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, numerator is 78x -156 sqrt(30).\n\nDivide by 13:\n\n(78x -156 sqrt(30))/13=6x -12 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n6(x -2\u221a30) =6x -12 sqrt(30).\n\nWhich is 6x -12\u221a30 =6x -12\u221a30.\n\nAgain, another identity. So, that doesn't help either.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need another approach.\n\nWait, let's recall that in triangle ABC, the distance from incenter I to vertex A is IA = 2*sqrt(39), and we have a right triangle OIA.\n\nWe also know that O is the circumradius center, so OA=13.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find the coordinates of points A, I, O and use coordinate geometry.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me place point I at the origin (0,0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and O is at some point along the line OI.\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), let me assume that O is along the y-axis, so O is at (0, k) for some k.\n\nThen, point A lies somewhere such that IA is perpendicular to OI, which is along the y-axis. So IA must be along the x-axis.\n\nWait, if OI is along the y-axis, then IA is along the x-axis.\n\nSo, point I is at (0,0), point O is at (0, k), and point A is at (m,0), since IA is along the x-axis.\n\nSince IA is the distance from I(0,0) to A(m,0), so IA = |m| =2*sqrt(39). So, m=2*sqrt(39) or m=-2*sqrt(39). Let's take m=2*sqrt(39) for simplicity.\n\nSo, point A is at (2\u221a39, 0).\n\nPoint O is at (0, k). The distance from O to A is OA=13.\n\nSo, OA is the distance between (0,k) and (2\u221a39,0):\n\nsqrt( (2\u221a39 -0)^2 + (0 -k)^2 )=13.\n\nSo,\n\n(2\u221a39)^2 +k\u00b2=13\u00b2.\n\nCompute (2\u221a39)^2=4*39=156.\n\nSo, 156 +k\u00b2=169 \u2192k\u00b2=13 \u2192k=\u221a13 or k=-\u221a13.\n\nSo, point O is at (0,\u221a13) or (0,-\u221a13). Let's take (0,\u221a13) for simplicity.\n\nSo, coordinates so far:\n\nI: (0,0)\n\nO: (0,\u221a13)\n\nA: (2\u221a39,0)\n\nNow, we need to find points B and C such that O is the circumradius center, I is the inradius center.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find the coordinates of B and C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the sides AB and AC using the coordinates.\n\nWait, point A is at (2\u221a39,0). We need to find AB and AC.\n\nWait, but without knowing points B and C, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in triangle ABC, the circumradius is 13, so the circumcircle has radius 13, centered at O(0,\u221a13).\n\nSo, all three points A, B, C lie on the circle centered at (0,\u221a13) with radius 13.\n\nWe know point A is (2\u221a39,0). Let's verify that it lies on the circle:\n\nDistance from O to A: sqrt( (2\u221a39)^2 + (\u221a13)^2 )=sqrt(156 +13)=sqrt(169)=13, which matches.\n\nSo, point A is on the circle.\n\nNow, points B and C also lie on this circle.\n\nMoreover, point I is the inradius center, which is at (0,0). The inradius is 6, so the inradius circle is centered at (0,0) with radius 6.\n\nIn a triangle, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find the equations of sides BC, AC, AB, knowing that they are tangent to the incircle at points which are distance 6 from I.\n\nWait, but without knowing the coordinates of B and C, this might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the inradius is 6, so the distance from I(0,0) to each side is 6.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can find the equations of the sides.\n\nWait, but for that, I need to know the equations of the sides.\n\nLet me think: The sides of the triangle are BC, AC, and AB.\n\nWe know point A is at (2\u221a39, 0). So, AC and AB are two sides from A to C and A to B.\n\nBut without knowing B and C, perhaps I can parameterize the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the lengths AB and AC using the coordinates.\n\nWait, another idea: Since I is the inradius center, the distances from I to each side are equal to the inradius, which is 6.\n\nSo, the distance from I(0,0) to side BC is 6, to side AC is 6, and to side AB is 6.\n\nBut we know the equation of side AC: it's the line from A(2\u221a39, 0) to C(x, y). Similarly for AB.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write the equation of side AC, knowing that the distance from I(0,0) to AC is 6.\n\nLet me suppose that point C is (p, q), which lies on the circumcircle.\n\nSo, point C lies on the circle centered at (0,\u221a13) with radius 13, so:\n\np\u00b2 + (q -\u221a13)^2 =13\u00b2=169.\n\nSimilarly, point C lies on side AC, which is the line from A(2\u221a39,0) to C(p,q). The equation of line AC can be written as:\n\nLet me find the equation of AC.\n\nThe line AC passes through points A(2\u221a39, 0) and C(p, q).\n\nThe slope of AC is (q -0)/(p -2\u221a39)= q/(p -2\u221a39).\n\nSo, the equation is y = [q/(p -2\u221a39)](x -2\u221a39).\n\nThe distance from I(0,0) to this line is 6.\n\nThe distance from a point (x0,y0) to the line ax + by +c =0 is |ax0 + by0 +c| /sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2).\n\nSo, first, let's write the equation of AC in ax + by +c=0 form.\n\nFrom y = [q/(p -2\u221a39)](x -2\u221a39), rearranged:\n\ny - [q/(p -2\u221a39)]x + [2\u221a39 q/(p -2\u221a39)] =0.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n[ -q/(p -2\u221a39) ] x + y + [2\u221a39 q/(p -2\u221a39)] =0.\n\nSo, a = -q/(p -2\u221a39), b=1, c=2\u221a39 q/(p -2\u221a39).\n\nThe distance from (0,0) to this line is |a*0 + b*0 +c| /sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2) = |c| /sqrt(a\u00b2 +1).\n\nThis distance is equal to 6.\n\nSo,\n\n|c| /sqrt(a\u00b2 +1) =6.\n\nCompute |c|:\n\n|c|=|2\u221a39 q/(p -2\u221a39)|.\n\nCompute a\u00b2 +1:\n\na\u00b2 +1 = [ q\u00b2/(p -2\u221a39)^2 ] +1.\n\nSo,\n\n|2\u221a39 q/(p -2\u221a39)| / sqrt( [ q\u00b2/(p -2\u221a39)^2 ] +1 ) =6.\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n[ (2\u221a39 q/(p -2\u221a39))\u00b2 ] / [ q\u00b2/(p -2\u221a39)^2 +1 ] =36.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: (4*39 q\u00b2)/(p -2\u221a39)^2 = (156 q\u00b2)/(p -2\u221a39)^2.\n\nDenominator: [ q\u00b2 + (p -2\u221a39)^2 ]/(p -2\u221a39)^2.\n\nSo, overall:\n\n[156 q\u00b2/(p -2\u221a39)^2 ] / [ (q\u00b2 + (p -2\u221a39)^2 )/(p -2\u221a39)^2 ) ] =36.\n\nSimplify:\n\n156 q\u00b2 / (q\u00b2 + (p -2\u221a39)^2 ) =36.\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n156 q\u00b2 =36 [ q\u00b2 + (p -2\u221a39)^2 ].\n\nDivide both sides by 12:\n\n13 q\u00b2 =3 [ q\u00b2 + (p -2\u221a39)^2 ].\n\nExpand right side:\n\n13 q\u00b2 =3 q\u00b2 +3(p -2\u221a39)^2.\n\nSubtract 3 q\u00b2:\n\n10 q\u00b2 =3(p -2\u221a39)^2.\n\nSo,\n\n3(p -2\u221a39)^2 =10 q\u00b2.\n\nHmm, that's one equation involving p and q.\n\nBut we also know that point C(p, q) lies on the circumcircle:\n\np\u00b2 + (q -\u221a13)^2 =169.\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1. 3(p -2\u221a39)^2 =10 q\u00b2.\n\n2. p\u00b2 + (q -\u221a13)^2 =169.\n\nLet me try to solve these equations.\n\nLet me expand equation 1:\n\n3(p\u00b2 -4\u221a39 p +4*39) =10 q\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n3p\u00b2 -12\u221a39 p +468 =10 q\u00b2.\n\nEquation 2:\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 -2\u221a13 q +13 =169.\n\nSimplify equation 2:\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 -2\u221a13 q =156.\n\nNow, from equation 1, we can express q\u00b2 in terms of p\u00b2.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n10 q\u00b2 =3p\u00b2 -12\u221a39 p +468 \u2192 q\u00b2 = (3p\u00b2 -12\u221a39 p +468)/10.\n\nSubstitute this into equation 2:\n\np\u00b2 + [ (3p\u00b2 -12\u221a39 p +468)/10 ] -2\u221a13 q =156.\n\nMultiply everything by 10 to eliminate denominator:\n\n10p\u00b2 +3p\u00b2 -12\u221a39 p +468 -20\u221a13 q =1560.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n13p\u00b2 -12\u221a39 p -20\u221a13 q +468 -1560=0.\n\nCompute 468 -1560= -1092.\n\nSo,\n\n13p\u00b2 -12\u221a39 p -20\u221a13 q -1092=0.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated because of the q term. Maybe I can find q in terms of p from equation 1.\n\nWait, from equation 1:\n\n3(p -2\u221a39)^2 =10 q\u00b2 \u2192 q = \u00b1sqrt( 3(p -2\u221a39)^2 /10 ).\n\nBut that introduces square roots, which might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express q from equation 2.\n\nWait, equation 2 is p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 -2\u221a13 q =156.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nq\u00b2 -2\u221a13 q + p\u00b2 -156=0.\n\nThis is a quadratic in q:\n\nq\u00b2 -2\u221a13 q + (p\u00b2 -156)=0.\n\nSolving for q using quadratic formula:\n\nq = [2\u221a13 \u00b1 sqrt( (2\u221a13)^2 -4*1*(p\u00b2 -156) ) ] / 2.\n\nSimplify discriminant:\n\n(2\u221a13)^2 =4*13=52.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(52 -4(p\u00b2 -156))=sqrt(52 -4p\u00b2 +624)=sqrt(676 -4p\u00b2)=sqrt(4(169 -p\u00b2))=2 sqrt(169 -p\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\nq = [2\u221a13 \u00b12 sqrt(169 -p\u00b2)] /2= \u221a13 \u00b1 sqrt(169 -p\u00b2).\n\nSo, q=\u221a13 + sqrt(169 -p\u00b2) or q=\u221a13 - sqrt(169 -p\u00b2).\n\nHmm, but this introduces square roots again.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a substitution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find p such that equation 1 and equation 2 are satisfied.\n\nWait, from equation 1:\n\n3(p -2\u221a39)^2 =10 q\u00b2 \u2192 q\u00b2= (3/10)(p -2\u221a39)^2.\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 -2\u221a13 q=156.\n\nSubstitute q\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 + (3/10)(p -2\u221a39)^2 -2\u221a13 q =156.\n\nWait, but this still leaves the q term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express sqrt(169 -p\u00b2) from q=\u221a13 \u00b1 sqrt(169 -p\u00b2) and substitute into equation 1.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nLet me take q=\u221a13 + sqrt(169 -p\u00b2).\n\nThen, from equation 1:\n\nq\u00b2= (3/10)(p -2\u221a39)^2.\n\nCompute q\u00b2:\n\n(\u221a13 + sqrt(169 -p\u00b2))\u00b2=13 + 2\u221a13 sqrt(169 -p\u00b2) + (169 -p\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\n13 +2\u221a13 sqrt(169 -p\u00b2) +169 -p\u00b2 = (3/10)(p\u00b2 -4\u221a39 p +4*39).\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n13 +169=182.\n\nSo,\n\n182 -p\u00b2 +2\u221a13 sqrt(169 -p\u00b2) = (3/10)(p\u00b2 -4\u221a39 p +156).\n\nMultiply both sides by 10 to eliminate denominator:\n\n10*(182 -p\u00b2) +20\u221a13 sqrt(169 -p\u00b2) =3(p\u00b2 -4\u221a39 p +156).\n\nCompute 10*(182 -p\u00b2)=1820 -10p\u00b2.\n\nRight side:3p\u00b2 -12\u221a39 p +468.\n\nSo,\n\n1820 -10p\u00b2 +20\u221a13 sqrt(169 -p\u00b2) =3p\u00b2 -12\u221a39 p +468.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n1820 -10p\u00b2 +20\u221a13 sqrt(169 -p\u00b2) -3p\u00b2 +12\u221a39 p -468=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1820 -468=1352.\n\n-10p\u00b2 -3p\u00b2= -13p\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n1352 -13p\u00b2 +12\u221a39 p +20\u221a13 sqrt(169 -p\u00b2)=0.\n\nThis seems very complicated. Maybe there's a smarter substitution or a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the triangle ABC with point A at (2\u221a39,0), inradius center at (0,0), and circumradius center at (0,\u221a13). Then, the sides AB and AC can be found using the coordinates.\n\nWait, but I need to find AB and AC, which are lengths from A to B and A to C.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that in triangle ABC, AB \u00b7 AC can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles.\n\nWait, AB \u00b7 AC = c b.\n\nBut AB and AC are sides opposite angles C and B, respectively.

Is the triangle isoceles?\n\nWait, if AB=AC, then the triangle would be isoceles with AB=AC.\n\nBut in that case, the incenter and circumcenter would lie on the axis of symmetry.\n\nBut in our case, IA is perpendicular to OI, which might not necessarily happen in an isoceles triangle.\n\nWait, but let me check.\n\nIf AB=AC, then the triangle is isoceles with AB=AC.\n\nIn that case, the incenter and circumcenter would lie on the altitude from A.\n\nBut in our coordinate system, point I is at (0,0), and O is at (0,\u221a13), so they lie on the y-axis, which would be the altitude from A(2\u221a39,0) to BC.\n\nBut in that case, point A is not on the y-axis, so the altitude from A would be the line from A(2\u221a39,0) to the midpoint of BC, which is on the y-axis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's possible.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to tell if AB=AC.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product AB \u00b7 AC can be found using other triangle properties.\n\nWait, another formula: In any triangle, AB \u00b7 AC = 2 R (b c) cos A.\n\nWait, no, let me think.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, AB =c, AC=b.\n\nWe have from the Law of Sines: c=2R sin C, b=2R sin B.\n\nSo, AB \u00b7 AC= c b=4 R\u00b2 sin B sin C.\n\nBut R=13, so c b=4*169 sin B sin C=676 sin B sin C.\n\nBut without knowing angles B and C, this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can relate angles B and C using other relations.\n\nWait, in a triangle, angles sum to \u03c0.\n\nSo, A + B + C=\u03c0.\n\nWe have angle A, so B + C=\u03c0 -A.\n\nBut we know sin A=2\u221a30/13, so A can be found.\n\nWait, sin A=2\u221a30/13, so A=arcsin(2\u221a30/13).\n\nBut perhaps we can find cos(B + C)=cos(\u03c0 -A)= -cos A= -7/13.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure how this helps.\n\nWait, another formula: In triangle ABC, the product of two sides can be expressed using the formula involving the circumradius and the sine of the included angle.\n\nWait, AB \u00b7 AC = 2 R\u00b2 sin B sin C.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the product of two sides in terms of the semiperimeter and the exradius.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, another thought: Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and IA is 2\u221a39, and OI is sqrt(13), perhaps I can consider the triangle OIA and use trigonometric relations.\n\nWait, in triangle OIA, right-angled at I, we have:\n\nsin(theta)= opposite/hypotenuse= IA/OA= (2\u221a39)/13.\n\nSo, sin(theta)=2\u221a39/13.\n\nBut theta is angle at O, which is angle IOA.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the Euler line, but in this case, since the triangle isn't necessarily equilateral or anything, Euler line might not be directly useful.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed as sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2), which we used earlier.\n\nWe have IA= sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2 )=sqrt(36 + (s -a)^2 )=2\u221a39.\n\nSo, 36 + (s -a)^2=4*39=156 \u2192(s -a)^2=120 \u2192s -a=2\u221a30.\n\nWhich we already have.\n\nSo, s= a +2\u221a30.\n\nWe also have from the Law of Cosines:\n\na\u00b2= b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 -2b c cos A.\n\nAnd from earlier:\n\na= b +c -4\u221a30.\n\nSo, a\u00b2= (b +c)^2 -8\u221a30 (b +c) +480.\n\nBut a\u00b2= b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 -

For any triangle, the formula is R = (a)/(2 sin A), where a is the side opposite angle A. Similarly, R = b/(2 sin B) and R = c/(2 sin C). Since the circumradius is 13, that's given.\n\nThe inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter. The formula is r = area / s, where s is the semiperimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2. Given that r is 6, so area = r * s = 6s.\n\nAlso, there are relationships between the inradius, circumradius, and other elements like the distance between the incenter and circumradius. The formula for the distance OI (where O is circumcenter and I is incenter) is OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that correct? Let me think.\n\nYes, Euler's formula states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). So, plugging the given values, R =13, r=6, so OI\u00b2 = 13(13 - 12) = 13(1) =13. So OI = sqrt(13).\n\nWait, but the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, that's an important condition. So the line from I to A is perpendicular to the line from O to I.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. So in triangle ABC, O is the circumcenter, I is the incenter. The line IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nHmm, maybe I can use coordinate geometry here. Let me try to set up a coordinate system.\n\nLet me place point I at the origin (0,0) to simplify calculations. Then, the line OI is from I(0,0) to O somewhere. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and point A is somewhere in the plane.\n\nWait, but if I is at (0,0), and O is at some point, say (h, k), then OI is the vector (h, k). IA is the vector from I(0,0) to A(x, y), which is (x, y). The condition is that IA is perpendicular to OI, so their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, (x)(h) + (y)(k) = 0. Hmm, that's one condition.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use vector geometry or properties of triangle centers.\n\nWait, another approach: In triangle ABC, since IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps we can relate the lengths of IA and OI with some trigonometric identities.\n\nWait, IA is the length from incenter I to vertex A. The formula for the length of the inradius is known, but IA is not the inradius, it's the distance from I to A.\n\nWait, the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex is given by IA = r / sin(A/2), where r is the inradius. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is IA = r / sin(A/2). Similarly, IB = r / sin(B/2), IC = r / sin(C/2).\n\nSo, IA = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nSimilarly, the distance OI is sqrt(13), as we calculated earlier.\n\nGiven that IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps we can consider the triangle formed by points O, I, and A. So, triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at I.\n\nWait, no. The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI, which is the line OI. So, the lines IA and OI are perpendicular, meaning that at the point where IA meets OI, which is at I, the angle is 90 degrees. So, triangle OIA is right-angled at I.\n\nTherefore, triangle OIA is a right triangle with right angle at I. So, by Pythagoras' theorem, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nBut OA is the distance from O to A, which is the circumradius, so OA = R =13.\n\nSo, OA\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169.\n\nOI\u00b2 we already found as 13, so OI = sqrt(13). So, OI\u00b2 =13.\n\nIA\u00b2 is (IA)^2. Since IA is 6 / sin(A/2), IA\u00b2 = 36 / sin\u00b2(A/2).\n\nTherefore, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2:\n\n169 = 13 + (36 / sin\u00b2(A/2)).\n\nSo, 169 -13 = 36 / sin\u00b2(A/2).\n\n156 = 36 / sin\u00b2(A/2).\n\nTherefore, sin\u00b2(A/2) = 36 /156 = 3/13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13). Because A is an angle in a triangle, so A/2 is between 0 and 90 degrees, so sine is positive.\n\nThus, sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13). So, cos(A/2) can be found using the identity sin\u00b2x + cos\u00b2x =1.\n\nSo, cos\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 3/13 = 10/13.\n\nThus, cos(A/2) = sqrt(10/13).\n\nNow, we can find some other trigonometric functions related to angle A.\n\nWe know that in triangle ABC, the area is r*s =6s, where s is semiperimeter.\n\nAlso, area can be expressed as (1/2)*ab*sin C, but perhaps more useful here is the formula involving the inradius and semiperimeter.\n\nAlternatively, the area can also be expressed using the formula:\n\nArea = (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides, and R is the circumradius.\n\nBut we need to find AB \u00b7 AC. Let's denote AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a, following the standard notation where a is opposite angle A, etc.\n\nWait, no, actually, in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. So, AB is c, AC is b, BC is a.\n\nSo, we're to find AB \u00b7 AC = c * b.\n\nSo, the product of sides AB and AC is c*b.\n\nWe can express the area in terms of the inradius: Area = r*s =6s.\n\nAlso, Area = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a*b*c)/52 \u2192 a*b*c = 6*52*s = 312 s.\n\nHmm, but we might need more relations to find c*b.\n\nWait, perhaps we can use the formula for the length of IA, which we have.\n\nIA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(3/13) = 6 * sqrt(13/3) = 6*sqrt(13)/sqrt(3) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nWait, let me compute that again.\n\nIA = 6 / sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(3/13) = 6 * sqrt(13/3) = 6 * sqrt(13)/sqrt(3) = 6*sqrt(13)*sqrt(3)/3 = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nSo, IA = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nBut in triangle OIA, which is right-angled at I, we have:\n\nOI = sqrt(13), IA = 2*sqrt(39), and OA =13.\n\nSo, as a check, OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = 13 + (4*39) =13 + 156=169=13\u00b2, which matches OA\u00b2, so that's correct.\n\nNow, perhaps I can find angle A or something related.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, the distance from I to A is IA, which is 2*sqrt(39). But I is the inradius, so I is the intersection of the angle bisectors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can relate angle A with the sides.\n\nWe have formulas involving sin(A/2) and cos(A/2). So, let's see.\n\nWe found that sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13), cos(A/2)=sqrt(10/13).\n\nWe can find sin A using the double-angle formula.\n\nsin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(sqrt(3/13))*(sqrt(10/13)) = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSimilarly, cos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(3/13) = 1 - 6/13 =7/13.\n\nSo, cos A =7/13.\n\nHmm, that's useful because in the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13).\n\nBut we're trying to find bc, which is AB \u00b7 AC = c*b.\n\nHmm, so perhaps if I can find expressions involving a, b, c, and use other relations.\n\nAnother formula is the area in terms of inradius: area = r*s =6s.\n\nAlso, area can be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nSo, area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nWe found sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, area = (1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) = (b*c*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nBut area is also 6s, so:\n\n(b*c*sqrt(30))/13 =6s.\n\nSo, b*c = (6s *13)/sqrt(30) = (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, but I don't know s yet. The semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a relation between a, b, c using other formulas.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, the distance from the inradius to vertex A is IA = 2*sqrt(39), which we found earlier.\n\nBut IA can also be expressed in terms of the sides. There's a formula for the length from the incenter to a vertex, which is IA = sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nWait, yes, the formula is IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nSimilarly, IB = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - b)^2), IC = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - c)^2).\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nWe have IA = 2*sqrt(39), so IA\u00b2 = 4*39=156.\n\nSo, 156 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nr is 6, so r\u00b2=36.\n\nSo, 156 =36 + (s - a)^2 \u2192 (s - a)^2=120 \u2192 s - a = sqrt(120)=2*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s - a =2*sqrt(30).\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2, so s - a = ( -a + b + c)/2 = (b + c -a)/2.\n\nSo, (b + c -a)/2 =2*sqrt(30) \u2192 b + c -a =4*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, a = b + c -4*sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, that's an equation relating a, b, c.\n\nWe also know that the area is 6s, and the area is (b c sin A)/2.\n\nWe have sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, area = (b c * (2*sqrt(30)/13))/2 = (b c sqrt(30))/13.\n\nBut area is also 6s, so:\n\n(b c sqrt(30))/13 =6s.\n\nSo, s = (b c sqrt(30))/(6*13) = (b c sqrt(30))/78.\n\nBut s is (a + b + c)/2, so:\n\n(a + b + c)/2 = (b c sqrt(30))/78.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\na + b + c = (2 b c sqrt(30))/78 = (b c sqrt(30))/39.\n\nHmm, but from earlier, we have a = b + c -4*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, substitute a into this equation.\n\nSo, (b + c -4*sqrt(30)) + b + c = (b c sqrt(30))/39.\n\nSimplify left side:\n\nb + c -4\u221a30 + b + c = 2b + 2c -4\u221a30.\n\nSo, 2b + 2c -4\u221a30 = (b c sqrt(30))/39.\n\nLet me factor out 2 on the left:\n\n2(b + c) -4\u221a30 = (b c sqrt(30))/39.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can let x = b + c and y = b c, to simplify.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet x = b + c\n\ny = b c\n\nThen, from a = b + c -4\u221a30, we have a =x -4\u221a30.\n\nWe also have the equation:\n\n2x -4\u221a30 = (y sqrt(30))/39.\n\nSo, 2x -4\u221a30 = (y sqrt(30))/39.\n\nLet me write that as equation (1): 2x -4\u221a30 = (y sqrt(30))/39.\n\nAnother equation comes from the Law of Cosines.\n\nWe have:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2b c cos A.\n\nWe know cos A =7/13, so:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2b c*(7/13).\n\nExpress b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 in terms of x and y.\n\nWe know that (b + c)^2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2b c \u2192 x\u00b2 = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2y \u2192 b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =x\u00b2 -2y.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 -2y) - (14 y)/13.\n\nSimplify:\n\na\u00b2 =x\u00b2 -2y -14y/13 =x\u00b2 - (26y +14y)/13 =x\u00b2 - (40y)/13.\n\nBut a =x -4\u221a30, so a\u00b2= (x -4\u221a30)^2 =x\u00b2 -8x\u221a30 + 16*30 =x\u00b2 -8x\u221a30 +480.\n\nSo, set equal:\n\nx\u00b2 -8x\u221a30 +480 =x\u00b2 - (40y)/13.\n\nSubtract x\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n-8x\u221a30 +480 = - (40y)/13.\n\nMultiply both sides by (-13/40):\n\n(8x\u221a30 *13)/40 - (480*13)/40 = y.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(104x\u221a30)/40 - (6240)/40 = y.\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\n104/40 =26/10=13/5.\n\n6240/40=156.\n\nSo, y= (13/5)x\u221a30 -156.\n\nSo, equation (2): y= (13\u221a30 /5) x -156.\n\nNow, from equation (1):\n\n2x -4\u221a30 = (y sqrt(30))/39.\n\nSubstitute y from equation (2) into equation (1):\n\n2x -4\u221a30 = [ (13\u221a30 /5 x -156 ) * sqrt(30) ] /39.\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\n(13\u221a30 /5 x -156 ) * sqrt(30) = (13\u221a30 * sqrt(30)/5 x ) -156 sqrt(30).\n\nSimplify sqrt(30)*sqrt(30) =30.\n\nSo, numerator becomes:\n\n(13*30/5)x -156 sqrt(30) = (13*6)x -156 sqrt(30)=78x -156 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n2x -4\u221a30 = (78x -156\u221a30)/39.\n\nMultiply both sides by 39 to eliminate denominator:\n\n39*(2x -4\u221a30) =78x -156\u221a30.\n\nCompute left side:\n\n78x -156\u221a30.\n\nRight side:78x -156\u221a30.\n\nSo, 78x -156\u221a30 =78x -156\u221a30.\n\nHmm, this simplifies to 0=0, which is an identity.\n\nThat suggests that equations (1) and (2) are dependent, so we don't get new information from substituting.\n\nSo, perhaps I need another equation.\n\nWait, earlier, we had area =6s= (b c sqrt(30))/13.\n\nBut s = (a +b +c)/2 = (x -4\u221a30 +x)/2 = (2x -4\u221a30)/2 =x -2\u221a30.\n\nSo, s =x -2\u221a30.\n\nSo, area =6s=6(x -2\u221a30).\n\nBut area is also (b c sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, 6(x -2\u221a30) = (y sqrt(30))/13.\n\nBut from equation (2), y= (13\u221a30 /5)x -156.\n\nSo, substitute y into this:\n\n6(x -2\u221a30) = [ (13\u221a30 /5 x -156 ) * sqrt(30) ] /13.\n\nLet me compute the right side:\n\n[ (13\u221a30 /5 x -156 ) * sqrt(30) ] /13.\n\nAgain, multiply numerator:\n\n13\u221a30 /5 x * sqrt(30) =13*(30)/5 x=13*6x=78x.\n\n-156 * sqrt(30) = -156 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, numerator is 78x -156 sqrt(30).\n\nDivide by 13:\n\n(78x -156 sqrt(30))/13=6x -12 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n6(x -2\u221a30) =6x -12 sqrt(30).\n\nWhich is 6x -12\u221a30 =6x -12\u221a30.\n\nAgain, another identity. So, that doesn't help either.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need another approach.\n\nWait, let's recall that in triangle ABC, the distance from incenter I to vertex A is IA = 2*sqrt(39), and we have a right triangle OIA.\n\nWe also know that O is the circumradius center, so OA=13.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find the coordinates of points A, I, O and use coordinate geometry.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me place point I at the origin (0,0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and O is at some point along the line OI.\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), let me assume that O is along the y-axis, so O is at (0, k) for some k.\n\nThen, point A lies somewhere such that IA is perpendicular to OI, which is along the y-axis. So IA must be along the x-axis.\n\nWait, if OI is along the y-axis, then IA is along the x-axis.\n\nSo, point I is at (0,0), point O is at (0, k), and point A is at (m,0), since IA is along the x-axis.\n\nSince IA is the distance from I(0,0) to A(m,0), so IA = |m| =2*sqrt(39). So, m=2*sqrt(39) or m=-2*sqrt(39). Let's take m=2*sqrt(39) for simplicity.\n\nSo, point A is at (2\u221a39, 0).\n\nPoint O is at (0, k). The distance from O to A is OA=13.\n\nSo, OA is the distance between (0,k) and (2\u221a39,0):\n\nsqrt( (2\u221a39 -0)^2 + (0 -k)^2 )=13.\n\nSo,\n\n(2\u221a39)^2 +k\u00b2=13\u00b2.\n\nCompute (2\u221a39)^2=4*39=156.\n\nSo, 156 +k\u00b2=169 \u2192k\u00b2=13 \u2192k=\u221a13 or k=-\u221a13.\n\nSo, point O is at (0,\u221a13) or (0,-\u221a13). Let's take (0,\u221a13) for simplicity.\n\nSo, coordinates so far:\n\nI: (0,0)\n\nO: (0,\u221a13)\n\nA: (2\u221a39,0)\n\nNow, we need to find points B and C such that O is the circumradius center, I is the inradius center.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find the coordinates of B and C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the sides AB and AC using the coordinates.\n\nWait, point A is at (2\u221a39,0). We need to find AB and AC.\n\nWait, but without knowing points B and C, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in triangle ABC, the circumradius is 13, so the circumcircle has radius 13, centered at O(0,\u221a13).\n\nSo, all three points A, B, C lie on the circle centered at (0,\u221a13) with radius 13.\n\nWe know point A is (2\u221a39,0). Let's verify that it lies on the circle:\n\nDistance from O to A: sqrt( (2\u221a39)^2 + (\u221a13)^2 )=sqrt(156 +13)=sqrt(169)=13, which matches.\n\nSo, point A is on the circle.\n\nNow, points B and C also lie on this circle.\n\nMoreover, point I is the inradius center, which is at (0,0). The inradius is 6, so the inradius circle is centered at (0,0) with radius 6.\n\nIn a triangle, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find the equations of sides BC, AC, AB, knowing that they are tangent to the incircle at points which are distance 6 from I.\n\nWait, but without knowing the coordinates of B and C, this might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the inradius is 6, so the distance from I(0,0) to each side is 6.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can find the equations of the sides.\n\nWait, but for that, I need to know the equations of the sides.\n\nLet me think: The sides of the triangle are BC, AC, and AB.\n\nWe know point A is at (2\u221a39, 0). So, AC and AB are two sides from A to C and A to B.\n\nBut without knowing B and C, perhaps I can parameterize the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the lengths AB and AC using the coordinates.\n\nWait, another idea: Since I is the inradius center, the distances from I to each side are equal to the inradius, which is 6.\n\nSo, the distance from I(0,0) to side BC is 6, to side AC is 6, and to side AB is 6.\n\nBut we know the equation of side AC: it's the line from A(2\u221a39, 0) to C(x, y). Similarly for AB.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write the equation of side AC, knowing that the distance from I(0,0) to AC is 6.\n\nLet me suppose that point C is (p, q), which lies on the circumcircle.\n\nSo, point C lies on the circle centered at (0,\u221a13) with radius 13, so:\n\np\u00b2 + (q -\u221a13)^2 =13\u00b2=169.\n\nSimilarly, point C lies on side AC, which is the line from A(2\u221a39,0) to C(p,q). The equation of line AC can be written as:\n\nLet me find the equation of AC.\n\nThe line AC passes through points A(2\u221a39, 0) and C(p, q).\n\nThe slope of AC is (q -0)/(p -2\u221a39)= q/(p -2\u221a39).\n\nSo, the equation is y = [q/(p -2\u221a39)](x -2\u221a39).\n\nThe distance from I(0,0) to this line is 6.\n\nThe distance from a point (x0,y0) to the line ax + by +c =0 is |ax0 + by0 +c| /sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2).\n\nSo, first, let's write the equation of AC in ax + by +c=0 form.\n\nFrom y = [q/(p -2\u221a39)](x -2\u221a39), rearranged:\n\ny - [q/(p -2\u221a39)]x + [2\u221a39 q/(p -2\u221a39)] =0.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n[ -q/(p -2\u221a39) ] x + y + [2\u221a39 q/(p -2\u221a39)] =0.\n\nSo, a = -q/(p -2\u221a39), b=1, c=2\u221a39 q/(p -2\u221a39).\n\nThe distance from (0,0) to this line is |a*0 + b*0 +c| /sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2) = |c| /sqrt(a\u00b2 +1).\n\nThis distance is equal to 6.\n\nSo,\n\n|c| /sqrt(a\u00b2 +1) =6.\n\nCompute |c|:\n\n|c|=|2\u221a39 q/(p -2\u221a39)|.\n\nCompute a\u00b2 +1:\n\na\u00b2 +1 = [ q\u00b2/(p -2\u221a39)^2 ] +1.\n\nSo,\n\n|2\u221a39 q/(p -2\u221a39)| / sqrt( [ q\u00b2/(p -2\u221a39)^2 ] +1 ) =6.\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n[ (2\u221a39 q/(p -2\u221a39))\u00b2 ] / [ q\u00b2/(p -2\u221a39)^2 +1 ] =36.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: (4*39 q\u00b2)/(p -2\u221a39)^2 = (156 q\u00b2)/(p -2\u221a39)^2.\n\nDenominator: [ q\u00b2 + (p -2\u221a39)^2 ]/(p -2\u221a39)^2.\n\nSo, overall:\n\n[156 q\u00b2/(p -2\u221a39)^2 ] / [ (q\u00b2 + (p -2\u221a39)^2 )/(p -2\u221a39)^2 ) ] =36.\n\nSimplify:\n\n156 q\u00b2 / (q\u00b2 + (p -2\u221a39)^2 ) =36.\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n156 q\u00b2 =36 [ q\u00b2 + (p -2\u221a39)^2 ].\n\nDivide both sides by 12:\n\n13 q\u00b2 =3 [ q\u00b2 + (p -2\u221a39)^2 ].\n\nExpand right side:\n\n13 q\u00b2 =3 q\u00b2 +3(p -2\u221a39)^2.\n\nSubtract 3 q\u00b2:\n\n10 q\u00b2 =3(p -2\u221a39)^2.\n\nSo,\n\n3(p -2\u221a39)^2 =10 q\u00b2.\n\nHmm, that's one equation involving p and q.\n\nBut we also know that point C(p, q) lies on the circumcircle:\n\np\u00b2 + (q -\u221a13)^2 =169.\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1. 3(p -2\u221a39)^2 =10 q\u00b2.\n\n2. p\u00b2 + (q -\u221a13)^2 =169.\n\nLet me try to solve these equations.\n\nLet me expand equation 1:\n\n3(p\u00b2 -4\u221a39 p +4*39) =10 q\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n3p\u00b2 -12\u221a39 p +468 =10 q\u00b2.\n\nEquation 2:\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 -2\u221a13 q +13 =169.\n\nSimplify equation 2:\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 -2\u221a13 q =156.\n\nNow, from equation 1, we can express q\u00b2 in terms of p\u00b2.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n10 q\u00b2 =3p\u00b2 -12\u221a39 p +468 \u2192 q\u00b2 = (3p\u00b2 -12\u221a39 p +468)/10.\n\nSubstitute this into equation 2:\n\np\u00b2 + [ (3p\u00b2 -12\u221a39 p +468)/10 ] -2\u221a13 q =156.\n\nMultiply everything by 10 to eliminate denominator:\n\n10p\u00b2 +3p\u00b2 -12\u221a39 p +468 -20\u221a13 q =1560.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n13p\u00b2 -12\u221a39 p -20\u221a13 q +468 -1560=0.\n\nCompute 468 -1560= -1092.\n\nSo,\n\n13p\u00b2 -12\u221a39 p -20\u221a13 q -1092=0.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated because of the q term.

Then, the sides AB and AC can be found using the coordinates.\n\nWait, but I need to find AB and AC, which are lengths from A to B and A to C.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that in triangle ABC, AB \u00b7 AC can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles.\n\nWait, AB \u00b7 AC = c b.\n\nBut AB and AC are sides opposite angles C and B, respectively. Wait, no, in standard notation, side a is BC, opposite angle A; side b is AC, opposite angle B; side c is AB, opposite angle C.\n\nSo, AB is side c, AC is side b. So, AB \u00b7 AC =c b.\n\nWe can use the formula for the product of two sides in terms of the area and sine of included angle.\n\nWait, area = (1/2)*AB * AC * sin A.\n\nWe have area =6s, and sin A=2\u221a30/13.\n\nSo,\n\n6s= (1/2)*c*b*(2\u221a30/13)= (c b \u221a30)/13.\n\nThus,\n\nc b = (6s *13)/\u221a30= (78 s)/\u221a30.\n\nBut s= (a +b +c)/2.\n\nHmm, but without knowing a, b, c, this might not help directly.\n\nWait, but earlier, we found that s -a=2\u221a30.\n\nSo, s= a +2\u221a30.\n\nWait, no, wait: From earlier, we had s -a=2\u221a30 \u2192 s = a +2\u221a30.\n\nBut s is also (a +b +c)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n(a +b +c)/2 =a +2\u221a30.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\na +b +c=2a +4\u221a30.\n\nSo,\n\nb +c =a +4\u221a30.\n\nHmm, so b +c =a +4\u221a30.\n\nSo, a =b +c -4\u221a30.\n\nWhich is what we had earlier.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the product c b using the formula for area.\n\nWait, area is (c b sin A)/2=6s.\n\nSo,\n\nc b= (12 s)/sin A.\n\nWe have sin A=2\u221a30/13.\n\nSo,\n\nc b= (12 s *13)/(2\u221a30)= (156 s)/(2\u221a30)=78 s /\u221a30.\n\nBut s= a +2\u221a30.\n\nWait, no: s= (a +b +c)/2.\n\nBut from earlier, s= a +2\u221a30.\n\nWait, wait, earlier, we had s -a=2\u221a30 \u2192 s= a +2\u221a30.\n\nSo, s= a +2\u221a30.\n\nSo, substituting into c b=78 s /\u221a30.\n\nc b=78(a +2\u221a30)/\u221a30.\n\nSimplify:\n\n78/\u221a30=78\u221a30/30=13\u221a30/5.\n\nSo,\n\nc b= (13\u221a30 /5)(a +2\u221a30).\n\nSo,\n\nc b= (13\u221a30 /5)a + (13\u221a30 /5)(2\u221a30)= (13\u221a30 /5)a + (13*2*30)/5= (13\u221a30 /5)a + (780)/5= (13\u221a30 /5)a +156.\n\nHmm, now, if I can find a, then I can compute c b.\n\nSo, let's try to find a.\n\nWe know from the Law of Cosines:\n\na\u00b2= b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 -2b c cos A.\n\nWe have cos A=7/13.\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2= b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 - (14/13) b c.\n\nBut from earlier, a= b +c -4\u221a30.\n\nSo,\n\na= b +c -4\u221a30.\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\na\u00b2= (b +c)^2 -8\u221a30 (b +c) + 16*30= b\u00b2 +2b c +c\u00b2 -8\u221a30 (b +c) +480.\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2= b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 +2b c -8\u221a30 (b +c) +480.\n\nBut from Law of Cosines, a\u00b2= b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 - (14/13) b c.\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 +c\u00b2 - (14/13) b c = b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 +2b c -8\u221a30 (b +c) +480.\n\nSubtract b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n- (14/13) b c= 2b c -8\u221a30 (b +c) +480.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n- (14/13) b c -2b c +8\u221a30 (b +c) -480=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- (14/13 +26/13) b c +8\u221a30 (b +c) -480=0.\n\n- (40/13) b c +8\u221a30 (b +c) -480=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 13 to eliminate denominator:\n\n-40 b c +104\u221a30 (b +c) -6240=0.\n\nRearranged:\n\n-40 b c +104\u221a30 (b +c)=6240.\n\nDivide both sides by 8 to simplify:\n\n-5 b c +13\u221a30 (b +c)=780.\n\nHmm, but from earlier, we have:\n\nFrom the equation for s -a=2\u221a30, and a= b +c -4\u221a30.\n\nWe also have:\n\nFrom equation (2): y= (13\u221a30 /5) x -156, where x= b +c, y= b c.\n\nSo, y= (13\u221a30 /5) x -156.\n\nSo, substituting x= b +c and y= b c into the equation above:\n\n-5 y +13\u221a30 x=780.\n\nSo,\n\n-5 y +13\u221a30 x=780.\n\nBut y= (13\u221a30 /5)x -156.\n\nSo,\n\n-5*(13\u221a30 /5 x -156) +13\u221a30 x=780.\n\nSimplify:\n\n-13\u221a30 x +780 +13\u221a30 x=780.\n\nWhich simplifies to 780=780.\n\nAgain, an identity.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that the equations are dependent, and we cannot find unique values for b and c. Thus, perhaps I need to find another relation or make an assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that the inradius is 6, and express the area as 6s.\n\nBut we also have area= (c b sin A)/2= (c b * 2\u221a30/13)/2= (c b \u221a30)/13.\n\nSo,\n\n(c b \u221a30)/13=6s.\n\nBut s= a +2\u221a30.\n\nSo,\n\n(c b \u221a30)/13=6(a +2\u221a30).\n\nFrom earlier, c b= (13\u221a30 /5)a +156.\n\nSo,\n\n[(13\u221a30 /5)a +156] * \u221a30 /13=6(a +2\u221a30).\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n(13\u221a30 /5 a)*\u221a30 /13 +156*\u221a30 /13.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: (13\u221a30 /5 a)*\u221a30 /13= (13*30 /5 a)/13= (390/5 a)/13= (78 a)/13=6a.\n\nSecond term:156*\u221a30 /13= (156/13)\u221a30=12\u221a30.\n\nSo, left side is 6a +12\u221a30.\n\nRight side is6a +12\u221a30.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n6a +12\u221a30=6a +12\u221a30.\n\nWhich is an identity.\n\nHmm, so again, no new information.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look back at the coordinate system approach.\n\nWe have point A at (2\u221a39,0), point O at (0,\u221a13), and incenter I at (0,0).\n\nWe can find the coordinates of points B and C on the circumcircle, such that the inradius is 6.\n\nWait, the inradius is 6, so the distance from I(0,0) to each side is 6.\n\nSo, the sides BC, AC, and AB are all at a distance of 6 from (0,0).\n\nWe already considered side AC, but perhaps I can find the equations of the other sides.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the lengths of AB and AC using the fact that they are tangents from point A to the incircle.\n\nWait, in a triangle, the lengths from a vertex to the points of tangency on the incircle are equal.\n\nWait, the lengths from A to the points where the incircle touches AB and AC are both equal to (b + c -a)/2, which we found earlier as 2\u221a30.\n\nWait, yes, in a triangle, the lengths from a vertex to the points of tangency are s - opposite side.\n\nSo, from A, the lengths to the points of tangency on AB and AC are both equal to s -a.\n\nWhich we have as 2\u221a30.\n\nSo, the tangents from A to the incircle have length 2\u221a30.\n\nBut the distance from A to I is IA=2\u221a39, which we can relate to the tangent length.\n\nWait, the tangent length from A to the incircle is sqrt( IA\u00b2 - r\u00b2 ).\n\nWait, yes, because in general, the length of the tangent from a point to a circle is sqrt(d\u00b2 -r\u00b2), where d is the distance from the point to the center.\n\nSo, here, the length of the tangent from A to the incircle is sqrt( IA\u00b2 - r\u00b2 )=sqrt( (2\u221a39)^2 -6^2 )=sqrt(156 -36)=sqrt(120)=2\u221a30, which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can use the formula for the product of the lengths of the tangents from A to the incircle.\n\nBut in this case, both tangents are equal, so their product is (2\u221a30)^2=120.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps I can consider the formula for the area in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter, which we have.\n\nArea=6s.\n\nWe also have area=(c b sin A)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n6s= (c b sin A)/2.\n\nBut sin A=2\u221a30/13.\n\nSo,\n\n6s= (c b * 2\u221a30)/26.\n\nSimplify:\n\n6s= (c b \u221a30)/13.\n\nSo,\n\nc b= (6s *13)/\u221a30=78 s /\u221a30.\n\nBut s= (a +b +c)/2.\n\nHmm, but we also have s -a=2\u221a30.\n\nSo, s= a +2\u221a30.\n\nThus,\n\nc b=78 (a +2\u221a30)/\u221a30.\n\nBut we also have from the Law of Cosines:\n\na\u00b2= b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 - (14/13) b c.\n\nAnd from earlier, a= b +c -4\u221a30.\n\nThis seems to bring us back to the same system of equations.\n\nWait, perhaps I can assume that AB and AC are equal? Is the triangle isoceles?\n\nWait, if AB=AC, then the triangle would be isoceles with AB=AC.\n\nBut in that case, the incenter and circumcenter would lie on the axis of symmetry.\n\nBut in our case, IA is perpendicular to OI, which might not necessarily happen in an isoceles triangle.\n\nWait, but let me check.\n\nIf AB=AC, then the triangle is isoceles with AB=AC.\n\nIn that case, the incenter and circumcenter would lie on the altitude from A.\n\nBut in our coordinate system, point I is at (0,0), and O is at (0,\u221a13), so they lie on the y-axis, which would be the altitude from A(2\u221a39,0) to BC.\n\nBut in that case, point A is not on the y-axis, so the altitude from A would be the line from A(2\u221a39,0) to the midpoint of BC, which is on the y-axis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's possible.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to tell if AB=AC.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product AB \u00b7 AC can be found using other triangle properties.\n\nWait, another formula: In any triangle, AB \u00b7 AC = 2 R (b c) cos A.\n\nWait, no, let me think.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, AB =c, AC=b.\n\nWe have from the Law of Sines: c=2R sin C, b=2R sin B.\n\nSo, AB \u00b7 AC= c b=4 R\u00b2 sin B sin C.\n\nBut R=13, so c b=4*169 sin B sin C=676 sin B sin C.\n\nBut without knowing angles B and C, this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can relate angles B and C using other relations.\n\nWait, in a triangle, angles sum to \u03c0.\n\nSo, A + B + C=\u03c0.\n\nWe have angle A, so B + C=\u03c0 -A.\n\nBut we know sin A=2\u221a30/13, so A can be found.\n\nWait, sin A=2\u221a30/13, so A=arcsin(2\u221a30/13).\n\nBut perhaps we can find cos(B + C)=cos(\u03c0 -A)= -cos A= -7/13.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure how this helps.\n\nWait, another formula: In triangle ABC, the product of two sides can be expressed using the formula involving the circumradius and the sine of the included angle.\n\nWait, AB \u00b7 AC = 2 R\u00b2 sin B sin C.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the product of two sides in terms of the semiperimeter and the exradius.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, another thought: Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and IA is 2\u221a39, and OI is sqrt(13), perhaps I can consider the triangle OIA and use trigonometric relations.\n\nWait, in triangle OIA, right-angled at I, we have:\n\nsin(theta)= opposite/hypotenuse= IA/OA= (2\u221a39)/13.\n\nSo, sin(theta)=2\u221a39/13.\n\nBut theta is angle at O, which is angle IOA.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the Euler line, but in this case, since the triangle isn't necessarily equilateral or anything, Euler line might not be directly useful.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed as sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2), which we used earlier.\n\nWe have IA= sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2 )=sqrt(36 + (s -a)^2 )=2\u221a39.\n\nSo, 36 + (s -a)^2=4*39=156 \u2192(s -a)^2=120 \u2192s -a=2\u221a30.\n\nWhich we already have.\n\nSo, s= a +2\u221a30.\n\nWe also have from the Law of Cosines:\n\na\u00b2= b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 -2b c cos A.\n\nAnd from earlier:\n\na= b +c -4\u221a30.\n\nSo, a\u00b2= (b +c)^2 -8\u221a30 (b +c) +480.\n\nBut a\u00b2= b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 -

The circumradius (R) is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. So, R is 13 and r is 6 here.\n\nIA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the circumcenter O to the incenter I. So, IA \u22a5 OI. That must form some right angle between these two lines.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the incenter is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors. Their positions relative to each other can vary depending on the type of triangle. For example, in an acute triangle, O is inside the triangle, while I is always inside. In an obtuse triangle, O is outside, but I is still inside.\n\nBut in this case, since we have IA perpendicular to OI, maybe we can find some relationship between the distances or use coordinate geometry to model the problem.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Let me sketch a rough diagram in my mind. Triangle ABC, with O as the circumcenter and I as the incenter. IA is perpendicular to OI. So, if I were to draw lines from I to A and from O to I, they would form a right angle at I.\n\nI need to find AB\u00b7AC. Hmm, so maybe I can express AB and AC in terms of other known quantities or find some relation that connects them.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the product AB\u00b7AC can be related to the area and the circumradius. Let me recall the formula. Oh, wait, the formula for the area is (AB\u00b7AC\u00b7sin A)/2. Also, the area can be expressed as r*s, where s is the semi-perimeter. But I don't know s yet. Alternatively, the area can be expressed as (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides and R is the circumradius.\n\nWait, but I don't know the sides. Hmm. Maybe I can relate it through coordinates. Let me consider placing the triangle in a coordinate system to make things easier.\n\nLet me place point I at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), then O must lie somewhere along the x-axis or y-axis? Wait, no. Because OI is a line from I to O, and IA is perpendicular to that. So, if I is at (0,0), then O is somewhere along a line, and A is somewhere else such that IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nWait, maybe I can assign coordinates to make this easier. Let me set I at (0,0). Let me let O lie along the x-axis, so O is at (d, 0) for some d. Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, which is along the x-axis, IA must be vertical. So, point A must lie somewhere along the y-axis.\n\nWait, that could make things easier. Let me try that.\n\nSo, set I at (0,0), O at (d,0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, which is along the x-axis, IA must be along the y-axis. So, point A is at (0, a) for some a.\n\nBut wait, point A is a vertex of the triangle. So, the triangle ABC has vertex A at (0,a), incenter at (0,0), and circumradius 13.\n\nWait, the circumradius is the distance from O to each vertex. So, OA = OB = OC = 13. Since O is at (d,0), and A is at (0,a), the distance OA is sqrt((d)^2 + (a)^2) = 13. So, d\u00b2 + a\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169.\n\nThat's one equation.\n\nNow, the inradius is 6. The inradius formula is area / s, where s is the semi-perimeter. But I don't know the sides yet.\n\nAlternatively, in a triangle with inradius r and semi-perimeter s, the area is r*s. So, area = 6*s.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed using the circumradius formula: area = (a*b*c)/(4R). So, area = (AB*BC*CA)/(4*13) = (AB*BC*CA)/52.\n\nHmm, but I don't know AB, BC, or CA yet.\n\nWait, but in this coordinate system, point A is at (0,a), I is at (0,0). The inradius is 6, which is the distance from I to any side. Since I is at (0,0), and A is at (0,a), the side opposite A is BC. The inradius is the distance from I to BC, which is 6.\n\nWait, but in this coordinate system, BC is a line somewhere. Let me think about the coordinates of B and C.\n\nSince O is at (d,0), which is the circumradius center, so the circumradius is 13, so points B and C are on the circle centered at (d,0) with radius 13.\n\nBut point A is at (0,a). So, triangle ABC has coordinates A(0,a), B(x1,y1), C(x2,y2), with (x1 - d)^2 + y1^2 = 169, and (x2 - d)^2 + y2^2 = 169.\n\nAlso, the inradius is 6, which is the distance from I(0,0) to BC. So, the equation of line BC can be found, and the distance from (0,0) to this line is 6.\n\nAdditionally, the inradius is related to the area and semi-perimeter, so area = r*s = 6s.\n\nHmm, maybe I can find expressions for the sides in terms of a and d.\n\nWait, another thought: since I is the inradius, it is located at the intersection of the angle bisectors. In our coordinate system, I is at (0,0), which is also the origin.\n\nWait, point A is at (0,a), so the angle bisector of angle A passes through I. But since IA is along the y-axis, that suggests that the angle bisector of angle A is the y-axis. Therefore, the sides AB and AC must be symmetric with respect to the y-axis.\n\nTherefore, points B and C are symmetric with respect to the y-axis. So, if B is at (x, y), then C is at (-x, y). Because reflection over the y-axis would switch the x-coordinate sign.\n\nSo, points B and C are at (x, y) and (-x, y), respectively. Let me note that.\n\nSo, point B is (x,y), point C is (-x,y). Then, the triangle ABC has vertices at (0,a), (x,y), (-x,y).\n\nNow, let's compute the distances AB, AC, BC.\n\nAB is the distance from (0,a) to (x,y): sqrt((x)^2 + (a - y)^2).\n\nSimilarly, AC is sqrt((-x)^2 + (a - y)^2) = same as AB, so AB = AC. So, triangle ABC is isoceles with AB = AC. So, it's an isoceles triangle with base BC and equal sides AB and AC.\n\nWait, but in that case, the circumradius and inradius can be related in some way.\n\nWait, but maybe I can compute the coordinates more explicitly.\n\nSince points B and C are (x,y) and (-x,y), then BC is the line segment between them, which is horizontal, since y is the same. So, BC has length 2x.\n\nSo, BC = 2x.\n\nNow, let's find the equation of line BC. Points B(x,y) and C(-x,y). The equation of line BC can be found using the two-point form.\n\nThe slope of BC is (y - y)/(-x - x) = 0 / (-2x) = 0. So, it's a horizontal line. Therefore, the equation is y = y.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, points B and C are (x,y) and (-x,y). So, the line BC is the horizontal line y = y-coordinate. So, the equation is y = y, but that's just a horizontal line. Wait, no, that's not correct. The line BC is the horizontal line passing through (x,y) and (-x,y), which is y = y-coordinate of B and C. So, the equation is y = y.\n\nWait, no, that's redundant. Wait, the line BC is the horizontal line passing through (x,y) and (-x,y), so it's y = y, which is just the line y = y. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the line BC is the horizontal line passing through (x,y) and (-x,y), so it's simply y = k, where k is the y-coordinate of B and C.\n\nWait, yes, that's correct. So, the equation of line BC is y = k, where k is the y-coordinate of points B and C.\n\nBut in our case, since points B and C are (x,y) and (-x,y), the line BC is y = y. So, the distance from I(0,0) to BC is |y| / sqrt(0^2 + 1^2) = |y|. Since the inradius is 6, this distance must be 6. So, |y| = 6. Therefore, y = 6 or y = -6.\n\nBut since A is at (0,a), and the triangle is above the x-axis (assuming a > 0), then points B and C are likely above the x-axis as well, so y = 6.\n\nSo, points B and C are at (x,6) and (-x,6).\n\nSo, BC is the line y = 6, and the distance from I(0,0) to BC is 6, which is consistent with the inradius.\n\nSo, now I can write that the distance from I(0,0) to BC is 6, which we've used to find y = 6.\n\nSo, points B and C are at (x,6) and (-x,6). So, BC has length 2x.\n\nNow, the triangle ABC has vertices at (0,a), (x,6), (-x,6).\n\nLet me compute the sides AB and AC, and BC.\n\nAB is the distance from (0,a) to (x,6): sqrt(x\u00b2 + (a - 6)\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, AC is the same: sqrt(x\u00b2 + (a - 6)\u00b2). So, AB = AC.\n\nBC is the distance between (x,6) and (-x,6): sqrt( (2x)^2 + 0 ) = 2x.\n\nSo, sides are AB = AC = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (a - 6)^2 ), and BC = 2x.\n\nNow, since O is the circumradius center at (d, 0), and the circumradius is 13, so OA = OB = OC = 13.\n\nWe already have OA: distance from (d,0) to (0,a) is sqrt(d\u00b2 + a\u00b2) = 13. So, d\u00b2 + a\u00b2 = 169.\n\nSimilarly, OB is the distance from (d,0) to (x,6): sqrt( (x - d)^2 + (6)^2 ) = 13.\n\nSo, (x - d)^2 + 36 = 169 => (x - d)^2 = 133.\n\nSimilarly, OC is the distance from (d,0) to (-x,6): sqrt( (-x - d)^2 + 6^2 ) = 13.\n\nSo, (-x - d)^2 + 36 = 169 => (x + d)^2 = 133.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. (x - d)^2 = 133\n2. (x + d)^2 = 133\n\nLet me write them out:\n\n(x - d)^2 = x\u00b2 - 2xd + d\u00b2 = 133\n\n(x + d)^2 = x\u00b2 + 2xd + d\u00b2 = 133\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(x\u00b2 + 2xd + d\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 - 2xd + d\u00b2) = 133 - 133\n\nWhich simplifies to 4xd = 0 => 4xd = 0.\n\nSo, 4xd = 0 => either x = 0 or d = 0.\n\nBut x can't be zero because then points B and C would coincide at (0,6), which would degenerate the triangle. So, x \u2260 0, which implies d = 0.\n\nWait, so d = 0. So, O is at (0,0). But wait, O is the circumradius center. But in our coordinate system, I is at (0,0). So, O and I coincide? But in general, in a triangle, the circumcenter and incenter coincide only in an equilateral triangle.\n\nWait, but in our problem, triangle ABC is isoceles with AB = AC, but not necessarily equilateral. So, is it possible that O and I coincide here?\n\nWait, but if d = 0, then O is at (0,0), which is the same as I. So, in this case, the circumcenter and incenter coincide. Which would imply the triangle is equilateral. But in our case, triangle ABC is isoceles, but is it equilateral?\n\nWait, in an equilateral triangle, all centers coincide. But here, we have an isoceles triangle, so unless it's equilateral, the centers don't coincide. So, perhaps this suggests that my assumption about the coordinate system might be flawed.\n\nWait, but according to the equations, (x - d)^2 = 133 and (x + d)^2 = 133, which led to d = 0. So, perhaps in this problem, O and I coincide, making the triangle equilateral?\n\nBut wait, in that case, the inradius and circumradius would be related in a specific way. Let me recall that in an equilateral triangle, the inradius r is (a * sqrt(3))/6, and the circumradius R is (a * sqrt(3))/3, so R = 2r. But in our problem, R = 13 and r = 6. 13 is not equal to 2*6=12, so R is not equal to 2r. Therefore, the triangle cannot be equilateral. So, this suggests a contradiction.\n\nWait, so perhaps my initial assumption about the coordinate system is not the best approach. Maybe placing I at (0,0) and O on the x-axis isn't suitable because it leads to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a wrong assumption in setting up the coordinates. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should not place I at (0,0) but instead place O at (0,0). Let me try that.\n\nLet me try a different coordinate system where O is at (0,0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is the incenter, perhaps I can model this.\n\nWait, but if O is at (0,0), then I is somewhere else. IA is perpendicular to OI. So, vector IA is perpendicular to vector OI.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use vector approach here.\n\nLet me denote vectors. Let me let O be at origin (0,0). Let me denote vector OI as vector I, since O is at (0,0). Then, vector IA is perpendicular to vector I.\n\nSo, the dot product of IA and I is zero.\n\nLet me denote point I as (h, k), so vector OI is (h, k). Point A is at some point, say, (x, y). Then, vector IA is (x - h, y - k). The dot product of IA and OI should be zero.\n\nSo, (x - h)*h + (y - k)*k = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to h(x - h) + k(y - k) = 0.\n\nWhich is hx - h\u00b2 + ky - k\u00b2 = 0.\n\nSo, hx + ky = h\u00b2 + k\u00b2.\n\nThat's one equation.\n\nNow, since O is the circumradius center, OA = OB = OC = R = 13. So, point A is at (x,y), so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 169.\n\nAlso, the inradius is 6. The inradius is the distance from I(h,k) to any side of the triangle. Let me think about how to express that.\n\nAlternatively, the area of the triangle can be expressed in two ways: using the inradius, area = r*s = 6*s, and using the circumradius, area = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (AB*BC*CA)/(4*13) = (AB*BC*CA)/52.\n\nBut I don't know the sides yet.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can express the area in terms of coordinates.\n\nWait, point A is (x,y), point B is (p,q), point C is (r,s). The area can be calculated via determinant, but since it's a triangle, perhaps it's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since O is the circumradius center at (0,0), and the triangle ABC has coordinates A(x,y), B(p,q), C(r,s), with x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = 169.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nWait, let me recall that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r)\n\nWhere R is the circumradius and r is the inradius.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. I recall that in a triangle, the distance between O and I is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). So, OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r).\n\nGiven that R = 13 and r = 6, then OI\u00b2 = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).\n\nSo, the distance between O and I is sqrt(13).\n\nWait, that's useful. So, OI = sqrt(13). So, in my coordinate system where O is at (0,0) and I is at (h,k), then h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = 13.\n\nAlso, from the earlier condition, hx + ky = h\u00b2 + k\u00b2.\n\nBut I also know that point A is (x,y), and OA = 13, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 169.\n\nSo, hx + ky = h\u00b2 + k\u00b2.\n\nLet me write that as hx + ky = 13, since h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = (OI)^2 =13.\n\nSo, hx + ky = 13.\n\nBut hx + ky = 13 and x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 169.\n\nSo, perhaps I can solve for hx + ky in terms of x and y.\n\nWait, maybe I can parameterize point A on the circumcircle.\n\nSince point A is on the circumcircle of radius 13 centered at O(0,0), we can represent it as (13 cos \u03b8, 13 sin \u03b8) for some angle \u03b8.\n\nSo, let me set x = 13 cos \u03b8, y = 13 sin \u03b8.\n\nThen, hx + ky = h*(13 cos \u03b8) + k*(13 sin \u03b8) = 13 (h cos \u03b8 + k sin \u03b8) = 13.\n\nSo, dividing both sides by 13, we get h cos \u03b8 + k sin \u03b8 = 1.\n\nBut h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = 13.\n\nSo, h cos \u03b8 + k sin \u03b8 = 1.\n\nHmm, this is reminiscent of the dot product. Let me think of vector (h,k) and vector (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8). Their dot product is h cos \u03b8 + k sin \u03b8, which equals 1.\n\nSo, the dot product of vectors (h,k) and (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8) is 1.\n\nBut the dot product is also equal to |(h,k)| * |(cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8)| * cos \u03c6, where \u03c6 is the angle between them.\n\nSince |(h,k)| = sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2) = sqrt(13), and |(cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8)| = 1, so the dot product is sqrt(13) * 1 * cos \u03c6 = sqrt(13) cos \u03c6.\n\nThis equals 1, so sqrt(13) cos \u03c6 = 1 => cos \u03c6 = 1/sqrt(13) => \u03c6 = arccos(1/sqrt(13)).\n\nSo, the angle between vectors OI and OA is arccos(1/sqrt(13)).\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps directly. Maybe I can relate this to the triangle's properties.\n\nAlternatively, since point A is on the circumcircle, and IA is perpendicular to OI, which is the line from O to I.\n\nWait, so IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line IA is perpendicular to the line OI.\n\nSo, in vector terms, the vector IA is perpendicular to vector OI.\n\nSo, vector IA is A - I = (x - h, y - k). Vector OI is I - O = (h, k). Their dot product is zero: (x - h)h + (y - k)k = 0.\n\nWhich is hx - h\u00b2 + ky - k\u00b2 = 0. Which we have already established.\n\nBut since we have x = 13 cos \u03b8 and y = 13 sin \u03b8, substituting into hx + ky =13.\n\nSo, h*(13 cos \u03b8) + k*(13 sin \u03b8) =13 => h cos \u03b8 + k sin \u03b8 = 1.\n\nWhich is consistent with what we have.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find h and k in terms of \u03b8.\n\nWait, but maybe we can find another relation.\n\nWe also know that the inradius is 6. So, area = r*s =6s.\n\nBut the area can also be expressed as (a*b*c)/(4R). Hmm.\n\nBut I don't know the sides yet.\n\nAlternatively, area can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height.\n\nBut I don't know which base or height to take.\n\nWait, perhaps using coordinates, the area can be found via the shoelace formula.\n\nBut for that, I need coordinates of all three points.\n\nBut I only have coordinates of A and O. Hmm.\n\nWait, but O is the circumradius center. So, the triangle's vertices are A, B, C on the circumcircle of radius 13.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe using trigonometric identities.\n\nIn any triangle, the product AB\u00b7AC can be related to the sides and angles.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, AB is the length from A to B, AC is from A to C.\n\nIn terms of the circumradius, AB = 2R sin C and AC = 2R sin B.\n\nSo, AB\u00b7AC = (2R sin C)(2R sin B) = 4R\u00b2 sin B sin C.\n\nHmm, but I don't know angles B and C.\n\nAlternatively, since the triangle is isoceles with AB=AC, as we saw earlier when we tried to set up coordinates, but that led to a contradiction.\n\nWait, but maybe it's not isoceles. Wait, in the first coordinate system, I assumed that because IA is along the y-axis, and the inradius is at the origin, the triangle is isoceles. But perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the triangle isn't isoceles. Let me reevaluate that.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I placed I at (0,0), O at (d,0), and A at (0,a). Then, found that points B and C are symmetric across the y-axis, making AB=AC. But that led to O and I coinciding, which would require the triangle to be equilateral, which it's not because R \u2260 2r.\n\nTherefore, that approach might not be valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triangle isn't isoceles, and my initial assumption was wrong.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need a different approach. Let's think about the formula involving the distance between incenter and circumradius.\n\nWe have OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13.\n\nSo, OI = sqrt(13).\n\nSo, the distance between O and I is sqrt(13). Also, IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nSo, in triangle IOA, we have OI = sqrt(13), OA = 13, and IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nWait, triangle IOA: points I, O, A. In this triangle, OI = sqrt(13), OA = 13, and angle at I is 90 degrees because IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nWait, no. IA is perpendicular to OI, meaning that angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. So, in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees.\n\nWait, so triangle IOA is right-angled at I. So, by Pythagoras, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nSo, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nGiven OA =13, OI = sqrt(13), so:\n\n13\u00b2 = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 => 169 =13 + IA\u00b2 => IA\u00b2=156 => IA= sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nSo, IA = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nBut IA is the length from inradius center I to vertex A. In a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's parameters.\n\nI recall that the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by the formula:\n\nIA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 )\n\nWhere r is the inradius, s is the semi-perimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A (which is BC in this case).\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nWe have IA\u00b2 = 156, r=6, so:\n\n156 = 6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 => 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 => (s - a)^2 = 120 => s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s - a = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, okay. Also, in any triangle, the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nIn our case, sides are BC = a, AB = c, AC = b. Wait, no, wait: standard notation is BC = a, AC = b, AB = c.\n\nSo, semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, s - a = ( -a + b + c ) / 2.\n\nSo, (-a + b + c)/2 = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: -a + b + c = 4*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, equation (1): b + c - a = 4*sqrt(30).\n\nAlso, in the same triangle, the area can be expressed as r*s = 6s.\n\nAlso, area can be expressed using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2)*a*b*sin C, but that might not be helpful here.\n\nWait, another formula for area is using the circumradius: Area = (a*b*c)/(4R). So, Area = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a*b*c)/52 => a*b*c = 312 s.\n\nSo, equation (2): a*b*c = 312 s.\n\nAlso, using the Law of Cosines, perhaps, but I don't know the angles.\n\nWait, but we have another relation from the inradius formula: area = r*s =6s.\n\nSo, area is 6s, and also area is (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a*b*c)/52 => a*b*c = 312 s.\n\nSo, equation (2) is a*b*c = 312 s.\n\nAlso, the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nWe have equation (1): b + c - a = 4*sqrt(30).\n\nWhich can be rewritten as (b + c) = a + 4*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s = (a + b + c)/2 = (a + (a + 4*sqrt(30)))/2 = (2a + 4*sqrt(30))/2 = a + 2*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s = a + 2*sqrt(30).\n\nNow, from equation (2): a*b*c = 312 s = 312*(a + 2*sqrt(30)).\n\nSo, a*b*c = 312a + 624*sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nBut I need to find AB\u00b7AC, which is c*b. So, the product of sides AB and AC.\n\nWait, so I need to find b*c.\n\nBut I don't know a, b, c. So, perhaps I can find another equation involving b and c.\n\nWait, another formula: in any triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = (r)/sin(A/2).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recall. The distance from the inradius to the vertex can be expressed as IA = (r)/sin(A/2).\n\nWait, let me verify. The inradius is r = 4R sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2). Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, another formula: In triangle ABC, the distance from incenter I to vertex A is given by IA = 2R sin(A/2).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think.\n\nWait, in the formula, IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Hmm, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, let me derive it.\n\nIn triangle ABC, the inradius r is related to the angles.\n\nThe distance from I to A can be expressed in terms of the exradius or something else. Alternatively, using trigonometric identities.\n\nWait, in triangle AII_a, where I_a is the excenter opposite A, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 ). Which we have already used.\n\nWait, but we have IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nWhich we used earlier.\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = 36 + (s - a)^2 =156 => (s -a)^2=120 => s -a= sqrt(120)=2*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s = a + 2*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, that's equation (1).\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for area in two ways.\n\nArea =6s =6(a + 2\u221a30).\n\nAlso, area can be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nSo, 6(a + 2\u221a30) = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nSo, 12(a + 2\u221a30) = b*c*sin A.\n\nBut I don't know sin A.\n\nAlternatively, using the Law of Cosines on angle A: a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2b c cos A.\n\nBut again, I don't know cos A.\n\nWait, but from the circumradius formula, a = 2R sin A. So, a = 2*13*sin A => a=26 sin A.\n\nSimilarly, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.\n\nSo, sides are proportional to the sine of the opposite angles.\n\nSo, a=26 sin A, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.\n\nAlso, since in a triangle, angles sum to \u03c0: A + B + C = \u03c0.\n\nSo, we can express B and C in terms of A.\n\nBut perhaps that's too vague.\n\nWait, but since the triangle is not necessarily isoceles, I can't assume B = C.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I tried to set up coordinates, I thought that the triangle was isoceles, but that led to a contradiction. So, maybe the triangle isn't isoceles, so B \u2260 C.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nWait, let me recall that in any triangle, the product of two sides can be expressed in terms of the circumradius and the sine of the included angle.\n\nSo, AB = 2R sin C, AC = 2R sin B.\n\nSo, AB\u00b7AC = 4 R\u00b2 sin B sin C.\n\nBut in this case, R=13, so AB\u00b7AC=4*(13)^2 sin B sin C= 4*169 sin B sin C= 676 sin B sin C.\n\nSo, if I can find sin B sin C, I can find AB\u00b7AC.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, in a triangle, we have some identities. For example, sin B sin C can be expressed in terms of cos(B - C) - cos(B + C) over 2.\n\nBut since B + C = \u03c0 - A, cos(B + C) = cos(\u03c0 - A) = -cos A.\n\nSo, sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) + cos A]/2.\n\nHmm, but I don't know B - C or cos A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for area.\n\nArea = (1/2)ab sin C, but that might not help.\n\nWait, perhaps using the Law of Sines.\n\nWe have a =26 sin A, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.\n\nAnd, we have from equation (1): b + c -a =4\u221a30.\n\nSo, substituting a, b, c:\n\n26 sin B + 26 sin C -26 sin A =4\u221a30.\n\nDivide both sides by 26:\n\nsin B + sin C - sin A = (4\u221a30)/26 = (2\u221a30)/13.\n\nHmm, that's an equation involving the sines of the angles.\n\nAlso, since A + B + C = \u03c0, we can express B + C = \u03c0 - A.\n\nSo, perhaps using sine addition formulas.\n\nLet me denote D = B - C.\n\nThen, sin B + sin C = 2 sin( (B + C)/2 ) cos( (B - C)/2 ) = 2 sin( (\u03c0 - A)/2 ) cos(D/2 ) = 2 cos(A/2) cos(D/2).\n\nSo, sin B + sin C = 2 cos(A/2) cos(D/2).\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\n2 cos(A/2) cos(D/2) - sin A = (2\u221a30)/13.\n\nHmm, but I don't know D or A.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, another formula: in any triangle, sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)]/2.\n\nBut as before, cos(B + C)=cos(\u03c0 - A)= -cos A.\n\nSo, sin B sin C= [cos(B - C) + cos A]/2.\n\nBut I still don't know cos A or cos(B - C).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the area in terms of R and angles.\n\nArea = (a b c)/(4 R) = (26 sin A)(26 sin B)(26 sin C)/(4*13) = (26^3 sin A sin B sin C)/(52) = (26\u00b2 sin A sin B sin C)/2.\n\nBut also, area =6s=6(a + 2\u221a30).\n\nSo,\n\n(26\u00b2 sin A sin B sin C)/2 =6(a + 2\u221a30).\n\nBut a=26 sin A, so:\n\n(676 sin A sin B sin C)/2 =6(26 sin A + 2\u221a30).\n\nSimplify:\n\n338 sin A sin B sin C = 156 sin A + 12\u221a30.\n\nDivide both sides by sin A (assuming sin A \u22600, which it isn't in a triangle):\n\n338 sin B sin C =156 + (12\u221a30)/sin A.\n\nHmm, but I don't know sin B sin C or sin A.\n\nWait, but from the Law of Sines, a=26 sin A, so sin A = a/26.\n\nSo, (12\u221a30)/sin A = (12\u221a30)*26/a = 312\u221a30 /a.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n338 sin B sin C =156 + 312\u221a30 /a.\n\nBut from equation (1): b + c -a =4\u221a30.\n\nExpressed in terms of sine:\n\n26(sin B + sin C) -26 sin A=4\u221a30.\n\nDivide by 26:\n\nsin B + sin C - sin A= (4\u221a30)/26 = 2\u221a30/13.\n\nSo, sin B + sin C = sin A + 2\u221a30/13.\n\nHmm, I'm not making progress here. Maybe I need to find another relation.\n\nWait, perhaps using the fact that in any triangle, cos A = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2)/(2bc).\n\nBut I don't know b, c, a.\n\nWait, but from equation (1): b + c = a +4\u221a30.\n\nSo, maybe I can express b + c in terms of a.\n\nLet me denote S = b + c = a +4\u221a30.\n\nAnd P = bc, which is the product I'm trying to find.\n\nAlso, from the area formula:\n\nArea =6s=6(a + 2\u221a30).\n\nAlso, area can be expressed as (1/2)bc sin A.\n\nSo,\n\n6(a + 2\u221a30) = (1/2) bc sin A.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n12(a + 2\u221a30) = bc sin A.\n\nSo, bc sin A =12a +24\u221a30.\n\nBut I also know that a=26 sin A.\n\nSo, bc sin A=12*(26 sin A) +24\u221a30.\n\nSo, bc sin A=312 sin A +24\u221a30.\n\nAssuming sin A \u22600, we can divide both sides by sin A:\n\nbc =312 +24\u221a30 / sin A.\n\nHmm, but I don't know sin A.\n\nWait, but a=26 sin A => sin A =a/26.\n\nSo,\n\nbc=312 +24\u221a30 / (a/26) =312 + (24\u221a30 *26)/a =312 + (624\u221a30)/a.\n\nSo, bc=312 + (624\u221a30)/a.\n\nSo, equation (3): bc=312 + (624\u221a30)/a.\n\nBut from equation (2): a*b*c =312 s=312(a +2\u221a30).\n\nBut bc= [312(a +2\u221a30)] / a.\n\nWait, from equation (2): a*b*c =312*(a +2\u221a30).\n\nSo, bc= [312*(a +2\u221a30)] / a.\n\nSo, equation (2a): bc= 312*(a +2\u221a30)/a =312 + (624\u221a30)/a.\n\nWhich matches equation (3): bc=312 + (624\u221a30)/a.\n\nSo, this is consistent, but doesn't give new information.\n\nHmm, seems like I'm stuck here. Maybe I need to find another equation.\n\nWait, from the formula for area, which is also equal to r*s=6s=6(a +2\u221a30).\n\nAnd area is also equal to (1/2)*b*c*sin A=6(a +2\u221a30).\n\nSo, (1/2)*b*c*sin A=6(a +2\u221a30).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: b*c*sin A=12(a +2\u221a30).\n\nBut from earlier, we have:\n\nFrom equation (3): bc=312 + (624\u221a30)/a.\n\nSo, plug that into bc*sin A:\n\n[312 + (624\u221a30)/a] * sin A=12(a +2\u221a30).\n\nBut sin A =a/26.\n\nSo,\n\n[312 + (624\u221a30)/a]*(a/26)=12(a +2\u221a30).\n\nMultiply out:\n\n(312 * a)/26 + (624\u221a30)/26 =12a +24\u221a30.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(12a) + (24\u221a30) =12a +24\u221a30.\n\nWhich is an identity: 12a +24\u221a30=12a +24\u221a30.\n\nSo, this doesn't give new information.\n\nHmm, so I'm going in circles here.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the formula for bc in terms of a.\n\nFrom equation (3): bc=312 + (624\u221a30)/a.\n\nSo, bc=312 + (624\u221a30)/a.\n\nBut I need to find bc, so perhaps I can express a in terms of bc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using another relation.\n\nWait, let me recall that in any triangle, the following holds:\n\ncot(A/2) = (s - a)/r.\n\nWhich is a standard formula.\n\nSo, cot(A/2) = (s - a)/r.\n\nWe have s -a=2\u221a30, r=6.\n\nSo, cot(A/2)= (2\u221a30)/6=\u221a30/3.\n\nSo, cot(A/2)=\u221a30/3.\n\nWhich implies tan(A/2)=3/\u221a30=\u221a30/10.\n\nWait, because cot x =1/tan x.\n\nSo, tan(A/2)=\u221a30/10.\n\nSo, A/2 = arctan(\u221a30/10).\n\nSo, A=2 arctan(\u221a30/10).\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps, but perhaps I can compute sin A and cos A from here.\n\nLet me compute sin A and cos A.\n\nLet \u03b8= A/2.\n\nSo, tan \u03b8=\u221a30/10.\n\nSo, opposite=\u221a30, adjacent=10, hypotenuse= sqrt(10\u00b2 + (\u221a30)^2 )=sqrt(100 +30)=sqrt(130).\n\nSo, sin \u03b8=\u221a30/sqrt(130)=\u221a(30/130)=\u221a(3/13).\n\nSimilarly, cos \u03b8=10/sqrt(130)=sqrt(100/130)=sqrt(10/13).\n\nSo, sin \u03b8=\u221a(3/13), cos \u03b8=\u221a(10/13).\n\nNow, A=2\u03b8.\n\nSo, sin A=2 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8=2*(\u221a3/\u221a13)*(\u221a10/\u221a13)=2*(\u221a30)/13.\n\nSimilarly, cos A=cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8= (10/13) - (3/13)=7/13.\n\nSo, sin A=2\u221a30/13, cos A=7/13.\n\nSo, sin A=2\u221a30/13.\n\nSo, from earlier, a=26 sin A=26*(2\u221a30/13)=4\u221a30.\n\nSo, a=4\u221a30.\n\nSo, side BC is a=4\u221a30.\n\nNow, we can find bc from equation (2a): bc=312*(a +2\u221a30)/a.\n\nPlugging a=4\u221a30:\n\nbc=312*(4\u221a30 +2\u221a30)/(4\u221a30)=312*(6\u221a30)/(4\u221a30)=312*(6/4)=312*(3/2)=468.\n\nSo, bc=468.\n\nBut bc is AB\u00b7AC, since AB=c, AC=b. So, AB\u00b7AC=468.\n\nSo, the answer is 468.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. The problem is about triangle ABC. It says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. Also, IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC, which is AB\u00b7AC.\n\nHmm, okay, so let me recall what circumradius and inradius mean. The circumradius (R) is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. So, R is 13 and r is 6 here.\n\nIA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the circumcenter O to the incenter I. So, IA \u22a5 OI. That must form some right angle between these two lines.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the incenter is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors. Their positions relative to each other can vary depending on the type of triangle. For example, in an acute triangle, O is inside the triangle, while I is always inside. In an obtuse triangle, O is outside, but I is still inside.\n\nBut in this case, since we have IA perpendicular to OI, maybe we can find some relationship between the distances or use coordinate geometry to model the problem.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Let me sketch a rough diagram in my mind. Triangle ABC, with O as the circumcenter and I as the incenter. IA is perpendicular to OI. So, if I were to draw lines from I to A and from O to I, they would form a right angle at I.\n\nI need to find AB\u00b7AC. Hmm, so maybe I can express AB and AC in terms of other known quantities or find some relation that connects them.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the product AB\u00b7AC can be related to the area and the circumradius. Let me recall the formula. Oh, wait, the formula for the area is (AB\u00b7AC\u00b7sin A)/2. Also, the area can be expressed as r*s, where s is the semi-perimeter. But I don't know s yet. Alternatively, the area can be expressed as (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides and R is the circumradius.\n\nWait, but I don't know the sides. Hmm. Maybe I can relate it through coordinates. Let me consider placing the triangle in a coordinate system to make things easier.\n\nLet me place point I at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), then O must lie somewhere along the x-axis or y-axis? Wait, no. Because OI is a line from I to O, and IA is perpendicular to that. So, if I is at (0,0), then O is somewhere along a line, and A is somewhere else such that IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nWait, maybe I can assign coordinates to make this easier. Let me set I at (0,0). Let me let O lie along the x-axis, so O is at (d, 0) for some d. Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, which is along the x-axis, IA must be vertical. So, point A must lie somewhere along the y-axis.\n\nWait, that could make things easier. Let me try that.\n\nSo, set I at (0,0), O at (d,0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, which is along the x-axis, IA must be along the y-axis. So, point A is at (0, a) for some a.\n\nBut wait, point A is a vertex of the triangle. So, the triangle ABC has vertex A at (0,a), incenter at (0,0), and circumradius 13.\n\nWait, the circumradius is the distance from O to each vertex. So, OA = OB = OC = 13. Since O is at (d,0), and A is at (0,a), the distance OA is sqrt((d)^2 + (a)^2) = 13. So, d\u00b2 + a\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169.\n\nThat's one equation.\n\nNow, the inradius is 6. The inradius formula is area / s, where s is the semi-perimeter. But I don't know the sides yet.\n\nAlternatively, in a triangle with inradius r and semi-perimeter s, the area is r*s. So, area = 6*s.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed using the circumradius formula: area = (a*b*c)/(4R). So, area = (AB*BC*CA)/(4*13) = (AB*BC*CA)/52.\n\nHmm, but I don't know AB, BC, or CA yet.\n\nWait, but in this coordinate system, point A is at (0,a), I is at (0,0). The inradius is 6, which is the distance from I to any side. Since I is at (0,0), and A is at (0,a), the side opposite A is BC. The inradius is the distance from I to BC, which is 6.\n\nWait, but in this coordinate system, BC is a line somewhere. Let me think about the coordinates of B and C.\n\nSince O is at (d,0), which is the circumradius center, so the circumradius is 13, so points B and C are on the circle centered at (d,0) with radius 13.\n\nBut point A is at (0,a). So, triangle ABC has coordinates A(0,a), B(x1,y1), C(x2,y2), with (x1 - d)^2 + y1^2 = 169, and (x2 - d)^2 + y2^2 = 169.\n\nAlso, the inradius is 6, which is the distance from I(0,0) to BC. So, the equation of line BC can be found, and the distance from (0,0) to this line is 6.\n\nAdditionally, the inradius is related to the area and semi-perimeter, so area = r*s = 6s.\n\nHmm, maybe I can find expressions for the sides in terms of a and d.\n\nWait, another thought: since I is the inradius, it is located at the intersection of the angle bisectors. In our coordinate system, I is at (0,0), which is also the origin.\n\nWait, point A is at (0,a), so the angle bisector of angle A passes through I. But since IA is along the y-axis, that suggests that the angle bisector of angle A is the y-axis. Therefore, the sides AB and AC must be symmetric with respect to the y-axis.\n\nTherefore, points B and C are symmetric with respect to the y-axis. So, if B is at (x, y), then C is at (-x, y). Because reflection over the y-axis would switch the x-coordinate sign.\n\nSo, points B and C are at (x, y) and (-x, y), respectively. Let me note that.\n\nSo, point B is (x,y), point C is (-x,y). Then, the triangle ABC has vertices at (0,a), (x,y), (-x,y).\n\nNow, let's compute the distances AB, AC, BC.\n\nAB is the distance from (0,a) to (x,y): sqrt((x)^2 + (a - y)^2).\n\nSimilarly, AC is sqrt((-x)^2 + (a - y)^2) = same as AB, so AB = AC. So, triangle ABC is isoceles with AB = AC. So, it's an isoceles triangle with base BC and equal sides AB and AC.\n\nWait, but in that case, the circumradius and inradius can be related in some way.\n\nWait, but maybe I can compute the coordinates more explicitly.\n\nSince points B and C are (x,y) and (-x,y), then BC is the line segment between them, which is horizontal, since y is the same. So, BC has length 2x.\n\nSo, BC = 2x.\n\nNow, let's find the equation of line BC. Points B(x,y) and C(-x,y). The equation of line BC can be found using the two-point form.\n\nThe slope of BC is (y - y)/(-x - x) = 0 / (-2x) = 0. So, it's a horizontal line. Therefore, the equation is y = y.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, points B and C are (x,y) and (-x,y). So, the line BC is the horizontal line y = y-coordinate. So, the equation is y = y, but that's just a horizontal line. Wait, no, that's not correct. The line BC is the horizontal line passing through (x,y) and (-x,y), which is y = y-coordinate of B and C. So, the equation is y = y.\n\nWait, no, that's redundant. Wait, the line BC is the horizontal line passing through (x,y) and (-x,y), so it's y = y, which is just the line y = y. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the line BC is the horizontal line passing through (x,y) and (-x,y), so it's simply y = k, where k is the y-coordinate of B and C.\n\nWait, yes, that's correct. So, the equation of line BC is y = k, where k is the y-coordinate of points B and C.\n\nBut in our case, since points B and C are (x,y) and (-x,y), the line BC is y = y. So, the distance from I(0,0) to BC is |y| / sqrt(0^2 + 1^2) = |y|. Since the inradius is 6, this distance must be 6. So, |y| = 6. Therefore, y = 6 or y = -6.\n\nBut since A is at (0,a), and the triangle is above the x-axis (assuming a > 0), then points B and C are likely above the x-axis as well, so y = 6.\n\nSo, points B and C are at (x,6) and (-x,6).\n\nSo, BC is the line y = 6, and the distance from I(0,0) to BC is 6, which is consistent with the inradius.\n\nSo, now I can write that the distance from I(0,0) to BC is 6, which we've used to find y = 6.\n\nSo, points B and C are at (x,6) and (-x,6). So, BC has length 2x.\n\nNow, the triangle ABC has vertices at (0,a), (x,6), (-x,6).\n\nLet me compute the sides AB and AC, and BC.\n\nAB is the distance from (0,a) to (x,6): sqrt(x\u00b2 + (a - 6)\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, AC is the same: sqrt(x\u00b2 + (a - 6)\u00b2). So, AB = AC.\n\nBC is the distance between (x,6) and (-x,6): sqrt( (2x)^2 + 0 ) = 2x.\n\nSo, sides are AB = AC = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (a - 6)^2 ), and BC = 2x.\n\nNow, since O is the circumradius center at (d, 0), and the circumradius is 13, so OA = OB = OC = 13.\n\nWe already have OA: distance from (d,0) to (0,a) is sqrt(d\u00b2 + a\u00b2) = 13. So, d\u00b2 + a\u00b2 = 169.\n\nSimilarly, OB is the distance from (d,0) to (x,6): sqrt( (x - d)^2 + (6)^2 ) = 13.\n\nSo, (x - d)^2 + 36 = 169 => (x - d)^2 = 133.\n\nSimilarly, OC is the distance from (d,0) to (-x,6): sqrt( (-x - d)^2 + 6^2 ) = 13.\n\nSo, (-x - d)^2 + 36 = 169 => (x + d)^2 = 133.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. (x - d)^2 = 133\n2. (x + d)^2 = 133\n\nLet me write them out:\n\n(x - d)^2 = x\u00b2 - 2xd + d\u00b2 = 133\n\n(x + d)^2 = x\u00b2 + 2xd + d\u00b2 = 133\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(x\u00b2 + 2xd + d\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 - 2xd + d\u00b2) = 133 - 133\n\nWhich simplifies to 4xd = 0 => 4xd = 0.\n\nSo, 4xd = 0 => either x = 0 or d = 0.\n\nBut x can't be zero because then points B and C would coincide at (0,6), which would degenerate the triangle. So, x \u2260 0, which implies d = 0.\n\nWait, so d = 0. So, O is at (0,0). But wait, O is the circumradius center. But in our coordinate system, I is at (0,0). So, O and I coincide? But in general, in a triangle, the circumcenter and incenter coincide only in an equilateral triangle.\n\nWait, but in our problem, triangle ABC is isoceles with AB = AC, but not necessarily equilateral. So, is it possible that O and I coincide here?\n\nWait, but if d = 0, then O is at (0,0), which is the same as I. So, in this case, the circumcenter and incenter coincide. Which would imply the triangle is equilateral. But in our case, triangle ABC is isoceles, but is it equilateral?\n\nWait, in an equilateral triangle, all centers coincide. But here, we have an isoceles triangle, so unless it's equilateral, the centers don't coincide. So, perhaps this suggests that my assumption about the coordinate system might be flawed.\n\nWait, but according to the equations, (x - d)^2 = 133 and (x + d)^2 = 133, which led to d = 0. So, perhaps in this problem, O and I coincide, making the triangle equilateral?\n\nBut wait, in that case, the inradius and circumradius would be related in a specific way. Let me recall that in an equilateral triangle, the inradius r is (a * sqrt(3))/6, and the circumradius R is (a * sqrt(3))/3, so R = 2r. But in our problem, R = 13 and r = 6. 13 is not equal to 2*6=12, so R is not equal to 2r. Therefore, the triangle cannot be equilateral. So, this suggests a contradiction.\n\nWait, so perhaps my initial assumption about the coordinate system is not the best approach. Maybe placing I at (0,0) and O on the x-axis isn't suitable because it leads to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a wrong assumption in setting up the coordinates. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should not place I at (0,0) but instead place O at (0,0). Let me try that.\n\nLet me try a different coordinate system where O is at (0,0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is the incenter, perhaps I can model this.\n\nWait, but if O is at (0,0), then I is somewhere else. IA is perpendicular to OI. So, vector IA is perpendicular to vector OI.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use vector approach here.\n\nLet me denote vectors. Let me let O be at origin (0,0). Let me denote vector OI as vector I, since O is at (0,0). Then, vector IA is perpendicular to vector I.\n\nSo, the dot product of IA and I is zero.\n\nLet me denote point I as (h, k), so vector OI is (h, k). Point A is at some point, say, (x, y). Then, vector IA is (x - h, y - k). The dot product of IA and OI should be zero.\n\nSo, (x - h)*h + (y - k)*k = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to h(x - h) + k(y - k) = 0.\n\nWhich is hx - h\u00b2 + ky - k\u00b2 = 0.\n\nSo, hx + ky = h\u00b2 + k\u00b2.\n\nThat's one equation.\n\nNow, since O is the circumradius center, OA = OB = OC = R = 13. So, point A is at (x,y), so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 169.\n\nAlso, the inradius is 6. The inradius is the distance from I(h,k) to any side of the triangle. Let me think about how to express that.\n\nAlternatively, the area of the triangle can be expressed in two ways: using the inradius, area = r*s = 6*s, and using the circumradius, area = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (AB*BC*CA)/(4*13) = (AB*BC*CA)/52.\n\nBut I don't know the sides yet.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can express the area in terms of coordinates.\n\nWait, point A is (x,y), point B is (p,q), point C is (r,s). The area can be calculated via determinant, but since it's a triangle, perhaps it's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since O is the circumradius center at (0,0), and the triangle ABC has coordinates A(x,y), B(p,q), C(r,s), with x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = 169.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nWait, let me recall that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r)\n\nWhere R is the circumradius and r is the inradius.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. I recall that in a triangle, the distance between O and I is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). So, OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r).\n\nGiven that R = 13 and r = 6, then OI\u00b2 = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).\n\nSo, the distance between O and I is sqrt(13).\n\nWait, that's useful. So, OI = sqrt(13). So, in my coordinate system where O is at (0,0) and I is at (h,k), then h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = 13.\n\nAlso, from the earlier condition, hx + ky = h\u00b2 + k\u00b2.\n\nBut I also know that point A is (x,y), and OA = 13, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 169.\n\nSo, hx + ky = h\u00b2 + k\u00b2.\n\nLet me write that as hx + ky = 13, since h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = (OI)^2 =13.\n\nSo, hx + ky = 13.\n\nBut hx + ky = 13 and x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 169.\n\nSo, perhaps I can solve for hx + ky in terms of x and y.\n\nWait, maybe I can parameterize point A on the circumcircle.\n\nSince point A is on the circumcircle of radius 13 centered at O(0,0), we can represent it as (13 cos \u03b8, 13 sin \u03b8) for some angle \u03b8.\n\nSo, let me set x = 13 cos \u03b8, y = 13 sin \u03b8.\n\nThen, hx + ky = h*(13 cos \u03b8) + k*(13 sin \u03b8) = 13 (h cos \u03b8 + k sin \u03b8) = 13.\n\nSo, dividing both sides by 13, we get h cos \u03b8 + k sin \u03b8 = 1.\n\nBut h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = 13.\n\nSo, h cos \u03b8 + k sin \u03b8 = 1.\n\nHmm, this is reminiscent of the dot product. Let me think of vector (h,k) and vector (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8). Their dot product is h cos \u03b8 + k sin \u03b8, which equals 1.\n\nSo, the dot product of vectors (h,k) and (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8) is 1.\n\nBut the dot product is also equal to |(h,k)| * |(cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8)| * cos \u03c6, where \u03c6 is the angle between them.\n\nSince |(h,k)| = sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2) = sqrt(13), and |(cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8)| = 1, so the dot product is sqrt(13) * 1 * cos \u03c6 = sqrt(13) cos \u03c6.\n\nThis equals 1, so sqrt(13) cos \u03c6 = 1 => cos \u03c6 = 1/sqrt(13) => \u03c6 = arccos(1/sqrt(13)).\n\nSo, the angle between vectors OI and OA is arccos(1/sqrt(13)).\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps directly. Maybe I can relate this to the triangle's properties.\n\nAlternatively, since point A is on the circumcircle, and IA is perpendicular to OI, which is the line from O to I.\n\nWait, so IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line IA is perpendicular to the line OI.\n\nSo, in vector terms, the vector IA is perpendicular to vector OI.\n\nSo, vector IA is A - I = (x - h, y - k). Vector OI is I - O = (h, k). Their dot product is zero: (x - h)h + (y - k)k = 0.\n\nWhich is hx - h\u00b2 + ky - k\u00b2 = 0. Which we have already established.\n\nBut since we have x = 13 cos \u03b8 and y = 13 sin \u03b8, substituting into hx + ky =13.\n\nSo, h*(13 cos \u03b8) + k*(13 sin \u03b8) =13 => h cos \u03b8 + k sin \u03b8 = 1.\n\nWhich is consistent with what we have.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find h and k in terms of \u03b8.\n\nWait, but maybe we can find another relation.\n\nWe also know that the inradius is 6. So, area = r*s =6s.\n\nBut the area can also be expressed as (a*b*c)/(4R). Hmm.\n\nBut I don't know the sides yet.\n\nAlternatively, area can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height.\n\nBut I don't know which base or height to take.\n\nWait, perhaps using coordinates, the area can be found via the shoelace formula.\n\nBut for that, I need coordinates of all three points.\n\nBut I only have coordinates of A and O. Hmm.\n\nWait, but O is the circumradius center. So, the triangle's vertices are A, B, C on the circumcircle of radius 13.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe using trigonometric identities.\n\nIn any triangle, the product AB\u00b7AC can be related to the sides and angles.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, AB is the length from A to B, AC is from A to C.\n\nIn terms of the circumradius, AB = 2R sin C and AC = 2R sin B.\n\nSo, AB\u00b7AC = (2R sin C)(2R sin B) = 4R\u00b2 sin B sin C.\n\nHmm, but I don't know angles B and C.\n\nAlternatively, since the triangle is isoceles with AB=AC, as we saw earlier when we tried to set up coordinates, but that led to a contradiction.\n\nWait, but maybe it's not isoceles. Wait, in the first coordinate system, I assumed that because IA is along the y-axis, and the inradius is at the origin, the triangle is isoceles. But perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the triangle isn't isoceles. Let me reevaluate that.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I placed I at (0,0), O at (d,0), and A at (0,a). Then, found that points B and C are symmetric across the y-axis, making AB=AC. But that led to O and I coinciding, which would require the triangle to be equilateral, which it's not because R \u2260 2r.\n\nTherefore, that approach might not be valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triangle isn't isoceles, and my initial assumption was wrong.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need a different approach. Let's think about the formula involving the distance between incenter and circumradius.\n\nWe have OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13.\n\nSo, OI = sqrt(13).\n\nSo, the distance between O and I is sqrt(13). Also, IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nSo, in triangle IOA, we have OI = sqrt(13), OA = 13, and IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nWait, triangle IOA: points I, O, A. In this triangle, OI = sqrt(13), OA = 13, and angle at I is 90 degrees because IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nWait, no. IA is perpendicular to OI, meaning that angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. So, in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees.\n\nWait, so triangle IOA is right-angled at I. So, by Pythagoras, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nSo, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nGiven OA =13, OI = sqrt(13), so:\n\n13\u00b2 = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 => 169 =13 + IA\u00b2 => IA\u00b2=156 => IA= sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nSo, IA = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nBut IA is the length from inradius center I to vertex A. In a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's parameters.\n\nI recall that the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by the formula:\n\nIA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 )\n\nWhere r is the inradius, s is the semi-perimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A (which is BC in this case).\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nWe have IA\u00b2 = 156, r=6, so:\n\n156 = 6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 => 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 => (s - a)^2 = 120 => s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s - a = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, okay. Also, in any triangle, the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nIn our case, sides are BC = a, AB = c, AC = b. Wait, no, wait: standard notation is BC = a, AC = b, AB = c.\n\nSo, semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, s - a = ( -a + b + c ) / 2.\n\nSo, (-a + b + c)/2 = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: -a + b + c = 4*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, equation (1): b + c - a = 4*sqrt(30).\n\nAlso, in the same triangle, the area can be expressed as r*s = 6s.\n\nAlso, area can be expressed using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2)*a*b*sin C, but that might not be helpful here.\n\nWait, another formula for area is using the circumradius: Area = (a*b*c)/(4R). So, Area = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a*b*c)/52 => a*b*c = 312 s.\n\nSo, equation (2): a*b*c = 312 s.\n\nAlso, using the Law of Cosines, perhaps, but I don't know the angles.\n\nWait, but we have another relation from the inradius formula: area = r*s =6s.\n\nSo, area is 6s, and also area is (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a*b*c)/52 => a*b*c = 312 s.\n\nSo, equation (2) is a*b*c = 312 s.\n\nAlso, the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nWe have equation (1): b + c - a = 4*sqrt(30).\n\nWhich can be rewritten as (b + c) = a + 4*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s = (a + b + c)/2 = (a + (a + 4*sqrt(30)))/2 = (2a + 4*sqrt(30))/2 = a + 2*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s = a + 2*sqrt(30).\n\nNow, from equation (2): a*b*c = 312 s = 312*(a + 2*sqrt(30)).\n\nSo, a*b*c = 312a + 624*sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nBut I need to find AB\u00b7AC, which is c*b. So, the product of sides AB and AC.\n\nWait, so I need to find b*c.\n\nBut I don't know a, b, c. So, perhaps I can find another equation involving b and c.\n\nWait, another formula: in any triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = (r)/sin(A/2).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recall. The distance from the inradius to the vertex can be expressed as IA = (r)/sin(A/2).\n\nWait, let me verify. The inradius is r = 4R sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2). Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, another formula: In triangle ABC, the distance from incenter I to vertex A is given by IA = 2R sin(A/2).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think.\n\nWait, in the formula, IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Hmm, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, let me derive it.\n\nIn triangle ABC, the inradius r is related to the angles.\n\nThe distance from I to A can be expressed in terms of the exradius or something else. Alternatively, using trigonometric identities.\n\nWait, in triangle AII_a, where I_a is the excenter opposite A, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 ). Which we have already used.\n\nWait, but we have IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nWhich we used earlier.\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = 36 + (s - a)^2 =156 => (s -a)^2=120 => s -a= sqrt(120)=2*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s = a + 2*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, that's equation (1).\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for area in two ways.\n\nArea =6s =6(a + 2\u221a30).\n\nAlso, area can be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nSo, 6(a + 2\u221a30) = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nSo, 12(a + 2\u221a30) = b*c*sin A.\n\nBut I don't know sin A.\n\nAlternatively, using the Law of Cosines on angle A: a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2b c cos A.\n\nBut again, I don't know cos A.\n\nWait, but from the circumradius formula, a = 2R sin A. So, a = 2*13*sin A => a=26 sin A.\n\nSimilarly, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.\n\nSo, sides are proportional to the sine of the opposite angles.\n\nSo, a=26 sin A, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.\n\nAlso, since in a triangle, angles sum to \u03c0: A + B + C = \u03c0.\n\nSo, we can express B and C in terms of A.\n\nBut perhaps that's too vague.\n\nWait, but since the triangle is not necessarily isoceles, I can't assume B = C.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I tried to set up coordinates, I thought that the triangle was isoceles, but that led to a contradiction. So, maybe the triangle isn't isoceles, so B \u2260 C.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nWait, let me recall that in any triangle, the product of two sides can be expressed in terms of the circumradius and the sine of the included angle.\n\nSo, AB = 2R sin C, AC = 2R sin B.\n\nSo, AB\u00b7AC = 4 R\u00b2 sin B sin C.\n\nBut in this case, R=13, so AB\u00b7AC=4*(13)^2 sin B sin C= 4*169 sin B sin C= 676 sin B sin C.\n\nSo, if I can find sin B sin C, I can find AB\u00b7AC.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, in a triangle, we have some identities. For example, sin B sin C can be expressed in terms of cos(B - C) - cos(B + C) over 2.\n\nBut since B + C = \u03c0 - A, cos(B + C) = cos(\u03c0 - A) = -cos A.\n\nSo, sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) + cos A]/2.\n\nHmm, but I don't know B - C or cos A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for area.\n\nArea = (1/2)ab sin C, but that might not help.\n\nWait, perhaps using the Law of Sines.\n\nWe have a =26 sin A, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.\n\nAnd, we have from equation (1): b + c -a =4\u221a30.\n\nSo, substituting a, b, c:\n\n26 sin B + 26 sin C -26 sin A =4\u221a30.\n\nDivide both sides by 26:\n\nsin B + sin C - sin A = (4\u221a30)/26 = (2\u221a30)/13.\n\nHmm, that's an equation involving the sines of the angles.\n\nAlso, since A + B + C = \u03c0, we can express B + C = \u03c0 - A.\n\nSo, perhaps using sine addition formulas.\n\nLet me denote D = B - C.\n\nThen, sin B + sin C = 2 sin( (B + C)/2 ) cos( (B - C)/2 ) = 2 sin( (\u03c0 - A)/2 ) cos(D/2 ) = 2 cos(A/2) cos(D/2).\n\nSo, sin B + sin C = 2 cos(A/2) cos(D/2).\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\n2 cos(A/2) cos(D/2) - sin A = (2\u221a30)/13.\n\nHmm, but I don't know D or A.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, another formula: in any triangle, sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)]/2.\n\nBut as before, cos(B + C)=cos(\u03c0 - A)= -cos A.\n\nSo, sin B sin C= [cos(B - C) + cos A]/2.\n\nBut I still don't know cos A or cos(B - C).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the area in terms of R and angles.\n\nArea = (a b c)/(4 R) = (26 sin A)(26 sin B)(26 sin C)/(4*13) = (26^3 sin A sin B sin C)/(52) = (26\u00b2 sin A sin B sin C)/2.\n\nBut also, area =6s=6(a + 2\u221a30).\n\nSo,\n\n(26\u00b2 sin A sin B sin C)/2 =6(a + 2\u221a30).\n\nBut a=26 sin A, so:\n\n(676 sin A sin B sin C)/2 =6(26 sin A + 2\u221a30).\n\nSimplify:\n\n338 sin A sin B sin C = 156 sin A + 12\u221a30.\n\nDivide both sides by sin A (assuming sin A \u22600, which it isn't in a triangle):\n\n338 sin B sin C =156 + (12\u221a30)/sin A.\n\nHmm, but I don't know sin B sin C or sin A.\n\nWait, but from the Law of Sines, a=26 sin A, so sin A = a/26.\n\nSo, (12\u221a30)/sin A = (12\u221a30)*26/a = 312\u221a30 /a.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n338 sin B sin C =156 + 312\u221a30 /a.\n\nBut from equation (1): b + c -a =4\u221a30.\n\nExpressed in terms of sine:\n\n26(sin B + sin C) -26 sin A=4\u221a30.\n\nDivide by 26:\n\nsin B + sin C - sin A= (4\u221a30)/26 = 2\u221a30/13.\n\nSo, sin B + sin C = sin A + 2\u221a30/13.\n\nHmm, I'm not making progress here. Maybe I need to find another relation.\n\nWait, perhaps using the fact that in any triangle, cos A = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2)/(2bc).\n\nBut I don't know b, c, a.\n\nWait, but from equation (1): b + c = a +4\u221a30.\n\nSo, maybe I can express b + c in terms of a.\n\nLet me denote S = b + c = a +4\u221a30.\n\nAnd P = bc, which is the product I'm trying to find.\n\nAlso, from the area formula:\n\nArea =6s=6(a + 2\u221a30).\n\nAlso, area can be expressed as (1/2)bc sin A.\n\nSo,\n\n6(a + 2\u221a30) = (1/2) bc sin A.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n12(a + 2\u221a30) = bc sin A.\n\nSo, bc sin A =12a +24\u221a30.\n\nBut I also know that a=26 sin A.\n\nSo, bc sin A=12*(26 sin A) +24\u221a30.\n\nSo, bc sin A=312 sin A +24\u221a30.\n\nAssuming sin A \u22600, we can divide both sides by sin A:\n\nbc =312 +24\u221a30 / sin A.\n\nHmm, but I don't know sin A.\n\nWait, but a=26 sin A => sin A =a/26.\n\nSo,\n\nbc=312 +24\u221a30 / (a/26) =312 + (24\u221a30 *26)/a =312 + (624\u221a30)/a.\n\nSo, bc=312 + (624\u221a30)/a.\n\nSo, equation (3): bc=312 + (624\u221a30)/a.\n\nBut from equation (2): a*b*c =312 s=312(a +2\u221a30).\n\nBut bc= [312(a +2\u221a30)] / a.\n\nWait, from equation (2): a*b*c =312*(a +2\u221a30).\n\nSo, bc= [312*(a +2\u221a30)] / a.\n\nSo, equation (2a): bc= 312*(a +2\u221a30)/a =312 + (624\u221a30)/a.\n\nWhich matches equation (3): bc=312 + (624\u221a30)/a.\n\nSo, this is consistent, but doesn't give new information.\n\nHmm, seems like I'm stuck here. Maybe I need to find another equation.\n\nWait, from the formula for area, which is also equal to r*s=6s=6(a +2\u221a30).\n\nAnd area is also equal to (1/2)*b*c*sin A=6(a +2\u221a30).\n\nSo, (1/2)*b*c*sin A=6(a +2\u221a30).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: b*c*sin A=12(a +2\u221a30).\n\nBut from earlier, we have:\n\nFrom equation (3): bc=312 + (624\u221a30)/a.\n\nSo, plug that into bc*sin A:\n\n[312 + (624\u221a30)/a] * sin A=12(a +2\u221a30).\n\nBut sin A =a/26.\n\nSo,\n\n[312 + (624\u221a30)/a]*(a/26)=12(a +2\u221a30).\n\nMultiply out:\n\n(312 * a)/26 + (624\u221a30)/26 =12a +24\u221a30.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(12a) + (24\u221a30) =12a +24\u221a30.\n\nWhich is an identity: 12a +24\u221a30=12a +24\u221a30.\n\nSo, this doesn't give new information.\n\nHmm, so I'm going in circles here.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the formula for bc in terms of a.\n\nFrom equation (3): bc=312 + (624\u221a30)/a.\n\nSo, bc=312 + (624\u221a30)/a.\n\nBut I need to find bc, so perhaps I can express a in terms of bc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using another relation.\n\nWait, let me recall that in any triangle, the following holds:\n\ncot(A/2) = (s - a)/r.\n\nWhich is a standard formula.\n\nSo, cot(A/2) = (s - a)/r.\n\nWe have s -a=2\u221a30, r=6.\n\nSo, cot(A/2)= (2\u221a30)/6=\u221a30/3.\n\nSo, cot(A/2)=\u221a30/3.\n\nWhich implies tan(A/2)=3/\u221a30=\u221a30/10.\n\nWait, because cot x =1/tan x.\n\nSo, tan(A/2)=\u221a30/10.\n\nSo, A/2 = arctan(\u221a30/10).\n\nSo, A=2 arctan(\u221a30/10).\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps, but perhaps I can compute sin A and cos A from here.\n\nLet me compute sin A and cos A.\n\nLet \u03b8= A/2.\n\nSo, tan \u03b8=\u221a30/10.\n\nSo, opposite=\u221a30, adjacent=10, hypotenuse= sqrt(10\u00b2 + (\u221a30)^2 )=sqrt(100 +30)=sqrt(130).\n\nSo, sin \u03b8=\u221a30/sqrt(130)=\u221a(30/130)=\u221a(3/13).\n\nSimilarly, cos \u03b8=10/sqrt(130)=sqrt(100/130)=sqrt(10/13).\n\nSo, sin \u03b8=\u221a(3/13), cos \u03b8=\u221a(10/13).\n\nNow, A=2\u03b8.\n\nSo, sin A=2 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8=2*(\u221a3/\u221a13)*(\u221a10/\u221a13)=2*(\u221a30)/13.\n\nSimilarly, cos A=cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8= (10/13) - (3/13)=7/13.\n\nSo, sin A=2\u221a30/13, cos A=7/13.\n\nSo, sin A=2\u221a30/13.\n\nSo, from earlier, a=26 sin A=26*(2\u221a30/13)=4\u221a30.\n\nSo, a=4\u221a30.\n\nSo, side BC is a=4\u221a30.\n\nNow, we can find bc from equation (2a): bc=312*(a +2\u221a30)/a.\n\nPlugging a=4\u221a30:\n\nbc=312*(4\u221a30 +2\u221a30)/(4\u221a30)=312*(6\u221a30)/(4\u221a30)=312*(6/4)=312*(3/2)=468.\n\nSo, bc=468.\n\nBut bc is AB\u00b7AC, since AB=c, AC=b. So, AB\u00b7AC=468.\n\nSo, the answer is 468.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the circumradius \\( R = 13 \\) and the inradius \\( r = 6 \\). The condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) implies that triangle \\( IOA \\) is right-angled at \\( I \\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find \\( IA \\):\n\n\\[\nOA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \\implies 13^2 = (\\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \\implies 169 = 13 + IA^2 \\implies IA^2 = 156 \\implies IA = \\sqrt{156} = 2\\sqrt{39}.\n\\]\n\nThe distance from the incenter to vertex \\( A \\) is given by \\( IA = \\sqrt{r^2 + (s - a)^2} \\), where \\( s \\) is the semi-perimeter and \\( a \\) is the side opposite vertex \\( A \\). Substituting \\( IA^2 = 156 \\) and \\( r = 6 \\):\n\n\\[\n156 = 6^2 + (s - a)^2 \\implies 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 \\implies (s - a)^2 = 120 \\implies s - a = 2\\sqrt{30}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the semi-perimeter \\( s = a + 2\\sqrt{30} \\). Using the area formula \\( \\text{Area} = r \\cdot s = 6s \\) and also \\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{abc}{4R} \\), we equate:\n\n\\[\n6s = \\frac{abc}{52} \\implies abc = 312s.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( s = a + 2\\sqrt{30} \\):\n\n\\[\nabc = 312(a + 2\\sqrt{30}).\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the Law of Sines \\( a = 2R \\sin A = 26 \\sin A \\) and find \\( \\sin A \\) using the identity \\( \\cot(\\frac{A}{2}) = \\frac{s - a}{r} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\cot\\left(\\frac{A}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{6} = \\frac{\\sqrt{30}}{3} \\implies \\tan\\left(\\frac{A}{2}\\right) = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{30}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{30}}{10}.\n\\]\n\nConstructing a right triangle with opposite side \\( \\sqrt{30} \\) and adjacent side \\( 10 \\), the hypotenuse is \\( \\sqrt{130} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nWe have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It says that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC, so AB\u00b7AC.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me recall what I know about circumcenters and incenters. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the triangle, and it's the center of the circumscribed circle with radius 13. The incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors and is the center of the inscribed circle with radius 6.\n\nThe problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems like an important condition. Maybe I can use some properties related to that.\n\nI think I should start by drawing a diagram to visualize the problem. Although I'm not great at drawing, just sketching the triangle ABC with O and I inside. IA is perpendicular to OI, so maybe triangle IOA is a right triangle? That might help.\n\nLet me denote some variables. Let\u2019s let R be the circumradius, which is 13, and r be the inradius, which is 6. Let\u2019s also denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, c, opposite to angles A, B, C respectively. So, side a is BC, side b is AC, and side c is AB. Wait, actually, no\u2014usually, side a is opposite angle A, so that would be BC, side b opposite angle B is AC, and side c opposite angle C is AB. So, the sides are a = BC, b = AC, c = AB.\n\nWe need to find AB\u00b7AC, which would be c\u00b7b. So, our goal is to find the product of sides c and b.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the area and the sine of the included angle. Specifically, AB\u00b7AC = 2R^2 sin A, because from the formula, a = 2R sin A, but wait, no. Wait, actually, the Law of Sines says that a = 2R sin A, so sin A = a/(2R). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. The area of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter: Area = r\u00b7s, where s is the semiperimeter, (a+b+c)/2. Also, the area can be expressed using the circumradius: Area = (a\u00b7b\u00b7c)/(4R). So, maybe I can relate these two expressions for the area.\n\nBut I don't know the semiperimeter yet, so maybe that's not immediately helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps we can use coordinate geometry. Let me think about placing the triangle in a coordinate system to make the problem easier.\n\nLet me consider placing point I at the origin (0,0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), point O must lie somewhere on the line perpendicular to IA. But wait, IA is a segment from I to A, and OI is the line from O to I. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then O lies on the line perpendicular to IA at point I. Hmm, that might complicate things, but maybe it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can place the circumcenter O at (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and O is at (0,0), the line OI is the line from (0,0) to I. IA is perpendicular to OI, so IA has a direction perpendicular to OI.\n\nWait, maybe using coordinate geometry will complicate things. Let me think if there are any known theorems or properties that relate the inradius, circumradius, and the distance between the incenter and circumcenter.\n\nYes! There's a formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter (denoted as d) with the circumradius R, inradius r, and other parameters. The formula is:\n\nd\u00b2 = R(R - 2r)\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recall. I think it's called the formula of Euler, which states that the distance between incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). But wait, that's only true for certain triangles, or is it general?\n\nWait, no, Euler's formula says that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). But wait, does that hold for any triangle? Let me check.\n\nHmm, Euler's formula is d\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So, d\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Let me verify that.\n\nYes, Euler's formula states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R\u00b2 - 2Rr). So, in our case, R is 13, r is 6, so d\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So, d = sqrt(13).\n\nWait, but in our problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, triangle IOA is right-angled at I. Therefore, by Pythagoras theorem:\n\nOA\u00b2 = IO\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nBut OA is the circumradius, which is R =13. IO is the distance between incenter and circumradius, which we just found as sqrt(13). IA is the length from inradius to vertex A. Wait, IA is not the inradius, IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. Hmm, that's different.\n\nWait, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side, but IA is the distance from incenter to vertex A. So, IA is not equal to r; it's a different length.\n\nSo, in triangle IOA, we have OA\u00b2 = IO\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nSo, 13\u00b2 = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\n169 = 13 + IA\u00b2.\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = 169 -13 = 156, so IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nHmm, that's a useful piece of information.\n\nSo, IA = 2\u221a39.\n\nBut what is IA in terms of the triangle's properties? I think there's a formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex.\n\nYes, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed as:\n\nIA = \u221a(r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2),\n\nwhere s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite angle A.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recall. I think the formula for the length of the angle bisector or something else. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to derive it.\n\nLet me consider triangle AIO. Wait, no, perhaps using trigonometric relationships.\n\nAlternatively, in triangle AIO, which is right-angled at I, we have:\n\nOA\u00b2 = IO\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nWe already did that and found IA = sqrt(156).\n\nBut maybe I can relate IA to other triangle parameters.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: In triangle ABC, the distance from the inradius to vertex A can be given by:\n\nIA = (r)/(sin(A/2)).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. The inradius is related to the angles.\n\nWait, yes, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed in terms of the inradius and the angle at A.\n\nI think the formula is IA = r / sin(A/2).\n\nLet me verify that. Let me consider the inradius and the angle bisector.\n\nIn triangle ABC, the inradius is the distance from I to BC. The angle bisector from A to I divides angle A into two equal angles. So, in triangle AIF, where F is the point where the incircle touches BC, we can write:\n\nsin(A/2) = opposite side / hypotenuse = r / IA.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = r / IA, which implies IA = r / sin(A/2).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nBut earlier, we found IA = sqrt(156). So,\n\n6 / sin(A/2) = sqrt(156).\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(156).\n\nSimplify sqrt(156): sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). So, sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). So,\n\nsin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) ) = 3 / sqrt(39) = 3\u221a39 / 39 = \u221a39 /13.\n\nWait, because 3/sqrt(39) = (3*sqrt(39))/39 = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nHmm, okay. So, from here, we can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo, cos\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nWait, since A is an angle in a triangle, it's between 0 and 180 degrees, so A/2 is between 0 and 90, so cos(A/2) is positive.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nNow, perhaps we can relate this to other parts of the triangle.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the inradius r is related to the area and semiperimeter: r = Area / s, where s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed as (1/2)ab sin C, but in this case, maybe using the formula with the inradius is better.\n\nWait, but perhaps another formula: In triangle ABC, the length of the angle bisector from A can be given by some formula, but maybe that's not directly helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for the circumradius: R = (a)/(2 sin A). So, a = 2R sin A.\n\nSimilarly, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.\n\nBut we need to find AB\u00b7AC, which is c\u00b7b.\n\nSo, c\u00b7b = (2R sin C)(2R sin B) = 4R\u00b2 sin B sin C.\n\nHmm, but I don't know angles B and C, so maybe that's not directly helpful.\n\nWait, but in triangle ABC, angles B and C are related to angle A because A + B + C = 180 degrees.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for area in terms of inradius and semiperimeter: Area = r\u00b7s.\n\nAnd also, Area = (a\u00b7b\u00b7c)/(4R).\n\nSo, setting these equal: r\u00b7s = (a\u00b7b\u00b7c)/(4R).\n\nBut again, without knowing s or the sides, it's tricky.\n\nWait, maybe we can find angle A from the information we have.\n\nWe have sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, so we can find angle A.\n\nBut perhaps more useful would be to find cos A, since we can relate that to other parts.\n\nUsing the double-angle formula:\n\ncos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 - 78)/169 = 91/169 = 7*13 / (13*13) = 7/13.\n\nWait, wait, 91/169 simplifies to 7/13 because 91 is 7*13, and 169 is 13\u00b2. So, cos A = 7/13.\n\nHmm, that's a useful value. So, angle A has cosine 7/13, which means sin A can be found as sqrt(1 - (7/13)\u00b2) = sqrt(1 - 49/169) = sqrt(120/169) = sqrt(120)/13 = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, sin A = 2\u221a30 /13.\n\nNow, using the Law of Cosines, we can relate sides a, b, c.\n\nLaw of Cosines says that a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nBut we don't know a, b, c individually. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the product bc.\n\nWait, from the Law of Sines, a = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2\u221a30/13) = 4\u221a30.\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\na = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2\u221a30/13) = 2*13*(2\u221a30)/13. The 13 cancels out, so 2*2\u221a30 = 4\u221a30.\n\nSo, side a (which is BC) is 4\u221a30.\n\nSo, a = 4\u221a30.\n\nNow, using the Law of Cosines:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n(4\u221a30)\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13).\n\nCompute (4\u221a30)^2: 16*30 = 480.\n\nSo,\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nBut we need to find bc. Let me denote bc = x. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13)x.\n\nBut without another equation, this might not be sufficient. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe we can find another equation involving b and c.\n\nWe also know that the area of the triangle can be expressed as r*s, where r is the inradius (6) and s is the semiperimeter (s = (a + b + c)/2).\n\nSo, Area = r*s = 6*(a + b + c)/2 = 3*(a + b + c).\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nWhich is (1/2)*x*(2\u221a30/13) = (x\u221a30)/13.\n\nSo, setting the two expressions for area equal:\n\n3*(a + b + c) = (x\u221a30)/13.\n\nSo,\n\n3*(4\u221a30 + b + c) = (x\u221a30)/13.\n\nBut this seems complicated because we have two variables, b and c, and x is bc. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the formula for the semiperimeter.\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nWe also have the formula that relates the inradius, area, and semiperimeter: Area = r*s = 6*s.\n\nWe also have Area = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, setting these equal:\n\n6s = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo,\n\n6s = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2, so:\n\n6*(a + b + c)/2 = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSimplify:\n\n3*(a + b + c) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo,\n\na*b*c = 156*(a + b + c).\n\nHmm, but a is 4\u221a30, so:\n\n4\u221a30 * b * c = 156*(4\u221a30 + b + c).\n\nDivide both sides by 4\u221a30:\n\nb*c = [156*(4\u221a30 + b + c)] / (4\u221a30).\n\nSimplify 156 /4 = 39, so:\n\nb*c = 39*(4\u221a30 + b + c)/\u221a30.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, another idea: The formula that relates the distance from the inradius to a vertex is IA = \u221a(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2), as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nWe found IA = sqrt(156), so IA\u00b2 = 156.\n\nSo,\n\n156 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nWe know r =6, so r\u00b2 =36.\n\nSo,\n\n156 = 36 + (s - a)^2.\n\nSo,\n\n(s - a)^2 = 156 -36 = 120.\n\nSo,\n\ns - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s = a + 2\u221a30.\n\nBut a is 4\u221a30, so:\n\ns = 4\u221a30 + 2\u221a30 = 6\u221a30.\n\nSo, the semiperimeter s is 6\u221a30.\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2 = 6\u221a30.\n\nSo,\n\na + b + c = 12\u221a30.\n\nSince a is 4\u221a30, that gives:\n\n4\u221a30 + b + c = 12\u221a30.\n\nTherefore,\n\nb + c = 8\u221a30.\n\nSo, we have another equation: b + c = 8\u221a30.\n\nAnd earlier, from the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nSo, now, let's let x = bc, and y = b + c =8\u221a30.\n\nWe also know that b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (b + c)^2 - 2bc = y\u00b2 - 2x.\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\n480 = (y\u00b2 - 2x) - (14/13) x.\n\nSo,\n\n480 = y\u00b2 - 2x - (14/13)x.\n\nCombine the x terms:\n\n-2x - (14/13)x = - (26/13 +14/13)x = - (40/13)x.\n\nSo,\n\n480 = y\u00b2 - (40/13)x.\n\nWe know y =8\u221a30, so y\u00b2 = (8\u221a30)^2 =64 *30= 1920.\n\nSo,\n\n480 = 1920 - (40/13)x.\n\nRearranging,\n\n(40/13)x = 1920 -480 =1440.\n\nSo,\n\nx = (1440 *13)/40.\n\nSimplify:\n\n1440 /40 = 36, so x= 36 *13=468.\n\nSo, x=468.\n\nBut x = bc, so bc=468.\n\nWhich is the product AB\u00b7AC = c\u00b7b=468.\n\nSo, the answer is 468.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nWe have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It says that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC, so AB\u00b7AC.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me recall what I know about circumcenters and incenters. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the triangle, and it's the center of the circumscribed circle with radius 13. The incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors and is the center of the inscribed circle with radius 6.\n\nThe problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems like an important condition. Maybe I can use some properties related to that.\n\nI think I should start by drawing a diagram to visualize the problem. Although I'm not great at drawing, just sketching the triangle ABC with O and I inside. IA is perpendicular to OI, so maybe triangle IOA is a right triangle? That might help.\n\nLet me denote some variables. Let\u2019s let R be the circumradius, which is 13, and r be the inradius, which is 6. Let\u2019s also denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, c, opposite to angles A, B, C respectively. So, side a is BC, side b is AC, and side c is AB. Wait, actually, no\u2014usually, side a is opposite angle A, so that would be BC, side b opposite angle B is AC, and side c opposite angle C is AB. So, the sides are a = BC, b = AC, c = AB.\n\nWe need to find AB\u00b7AC, which would be c\u00b7b. So, our goal is to find the product of sides c and b.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the area and the sine of the included angle. Specifically, AB\u00b7AC = 2R^2 sin A, because from the formula, a = 2R sin A, but wait, no. Wait, actually, the Law of Sines says that a = 2R sin A, so sin A = a/(2R). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. The area of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter: Area = r\u00b7s, where s is the semiperimeter, (a+b+c)/2. Also, the area can be expressed using the circumradius: Area = (a\u00b7b\u00b7c)/(4R). So, maybe I can relate these two expressions for the area.\n\nBut I don't know the semiperimeter yet, so maybe that's not immediately helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps we can use coordinate geometry. Let me think about placing the triangle in a coordinate system to make the problem easier.\n\nLet me consider placing point I at the origin (0,0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), point O must lie somewhere on the line perpendicular to IA. But wait, IA is a segment from I to A, and OI is the line from O to I. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then O lies on the line perpendicular to IA at point I. Hmm, that might complicate things, but maybe it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can place the circumcenter O at (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and O is at (0,0), the line OI is the line from (0,0) to I. IA is perpendicular to OI, so IA has a direction perpendicular to OI.\n\nWait, maybe using coordinate geometry will complicate things. Let me think if there are any known theorems or properties that relate the inradius, circumradius, and the distance between the incenter and circumcenter.\n\nYes! There's a formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter (denoted as d) with the circumradius R, inradius r, and other parameters. The formula is:\n\nd\u00b2 = R(R - 2r)\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recall. I think it's called the formula of Euler, which states that the distance between incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). But wait, that's only true for certain triangles, or is it general?\n\nWait, no, Euler's formula says that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). But wait, does that hold for any triangle? Let me check.\n\nHmm, Euler's formula is d\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So, d\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Let me verify that.\n\nYes, Euler's formula states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R\u00b2 - 2Rr). So, in our case, R is 13, r is 6, so d\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So, d = sqrt(13).\n\nWait, but in our problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, triangle IOA is right-angled at I. Therefore, by Pythagoras theorem:\n\nOA\u00b2 = IO\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nBut OA is the circumradius, which is R =13. IO is the distance between incenter and circumradius, which we just found as sqrt(13). IA is the length from inradius to vertex A. Wait, IA is not the inradius, IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. Hmm, that's different.\n\nWait, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side, but IA is the distance from incenter to vertex A. So, IA is not equal to r; it's a different length.\n\nSo, in triangle IOA, we have OA\u00b2 = IO\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nSo, 13\u00b2 = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\n169 = 13 + IA\u00b2.\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = 169 -13 = 156, so IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nHmm, that's a useful piece of information.\n\nSo, IA = 2\u221a39.\n\nBut what is IA in terms of the triangle's properties? I think there's a formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex.\n\nYes, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed as:\n\nIA = \u221a(r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2),\n\nwhere s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite angle A.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recall. I think the formula for the length of the angle bisector or something else. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to derive it.\n\nLet me consider triangle AIO. Wait, no, perhaps using trigonometric relationships.\n\nAlternatively, in triangle AIO, which is right-angled at I, we have:\n\nOA\u00b2 = IO\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nWe already did that and found IA = sqrt(156).\n\nBut maybe I can relate IA to other triangle parameters.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: In triangle ABC, the distance from the inradius to vertex A can be given by:\n\nIA = (r)/(sin(A/2)).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. The inradius is related to the angles.\n\nWait, yes, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed in terms of the inradius and the angle at A.\n\nI think the formula is IA = r / sin(A/2).\n\nLet me verify that. Let me consider the inradius and the angle bisector.\n\nIn triangle ABC, the inradius is the distance from I to BC. The angle bisector from A to I divides angle A into two equal angles. So, in triangle AIF, where F is the point where the incircle touches BC, we can write:\n\nsin(A/2) = opposite side / hypotenuse = r / IA.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = r / IA, which implies IA = r / sin(A/2).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nBut earlier, we found IA = sqrt(156). So,\n\n6 / sin(A/2) = sqrt(156).\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(156).\n\nSimplify sqrt(156): sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). So, sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). So,\n\nsin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) ) = 3 / sqrt(39) = 3\u221a39 / 39 = \u221a39 /13.\n\nWait, because 3/sqrt(39) = (3*sqrt(39))/39 = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nHmm, okay. So, from here, we can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo, cos\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nWait, since A is an angle in a triangle, it's between 0 and 180 degrees, so A/2 is between 0 and 90, so cos(A/2) is positive.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nNow, perhaps we can relate this to other parts of the triangle.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the inradius r is related to the area and semiperimeter: r = Area / s, where s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed as (1/2)ab sin C, but in this case, maybe using the formula with the inradius is better.\n\nWait, but perhaps another formula: In triangle ABC, the length of the angle bisector from A can be given by some formula, but maybe that's not directly helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for the circumradius: R = (a)/(2 sin A). So, a = 2R sin A.\n\nSimilarly, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.\n\nBut we need to find AB\u00b7AC, which is c\u00b7b.\n\nSo, c\u00b7b = (2R sin C)(2R sin B) = 4R\u00b2 sin B sin C.\n\nHmm, but I don't know angles B and C, so maybe that's not directly helpful.\n\nWait, but in triangle ABC, angles B and C are related to angle A because A + B + C = 180 degrees.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for area in terms of inradius and semiperimeter: Area = r\u00b7s.\n\nAnd also, Area = (a\u00b7b\u00b7c)/(4R).\n\nSo, setting these equal: r\u00b7s = (a\u00b7b\u00b7c)/(4R).\n\nBut again, without knowing s or the sides, it's tricky.\n\nWait, maybe we can find angle A from the information we have.\n\nWe have sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, so we can find angle A.\n\nBut perhaps more useful would be to find cos A, since we can relate that to other parts.\n\nUsing the double-angle formula:\n\ncos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 - 78)/169 = 91/169 = 7*13 / (13*13) = 7/13.\n\nWait, wait, 91/169 simplifies to 7/13 because 91 is 7*13, and 169 is 13\u00b2. So, cos A = 7/13.\n\nHmm, that's a useful value. So, angle A has cosine 7/13, which means sin A can be found as sqrt(1 - (7/13)\u00b2) = sqrt(1 - 49/169) = sqrt(120/169) = sqrt(120)/13 = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, sin A = 2\u221a30 /13.\n\nNow, using the Law of Cosines, we can relate sides a, b, c.\n\nLaw of Cosines says that a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nBut we don't know a, b, c individually. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the product bc.\n\nWait, from the Law of Sines, a = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2\u221a30/13) = 4\u221a30.\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\na = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2\u221a30/13) = 2*13*(2\u221a30)/13. The 13 cancels out, so 2*2\u221a30 = 4\u221a30.\n\nSo, side a (which is BC) is 4\u221a30.\n\nSo, a = 4\u221a30.\n\nNow, using the Law of Cosines:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n(4\u221a30)\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13).\n\nCompute (4\u221a30)^2: 16*30 = 480.\n\nSo,\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nBut we need to find bc. Let me denote bc = x. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13)x.\n\nBut without another equation, this might not be sufficient. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe we can find another equation involving b and c.\n\nWe also know that the area of the triangle can be expressed as r*s, where r is the inradius (6) and s is the semiperimeter (s = (a + b + c)/2).\n\nSo, Area = r*s = 6*(a + b + c)/2 = 3*(a + b + c).\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nWhich is (1/2)*x*(2\u221a30/13) = (x\u221a30)/13.\n\nSo, setting the two expressions for area equal:\n\n3*(a + b + c) = (x\u221a30)/13.\n\nSo,\n\n3*(4\u221a30 + b + c) = (x\u221a30)/13.\n\nBut this seems complicated because we have two variables, b and c, and x is bc. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the formula for the semiperimeter.\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nWe also have the formula that relates the inradius, area, and semiperimeter: Area = r*s = 6*s.\n\nWe also have Area = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, setting these equal:\n\n6s = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo,\n\n6s = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2, so:\n\n6*(a + b + c)/2 = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSimplify:\n\n3*(a + b + c) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo,\n\na*b*c = 156*(a + b + c).\n\nHmm, but a is 4\u221a30, so:\n\n4\u221a30 * b * c = 156*(4\u221a30 + b + c).\n\nDivide both sides by 4\u221a30:\n\nb*c = [156*(4\u221a30 + b + c)] / (4\u221a30).\n\nSimplify 156 /4 = 39, so:\n\nb*c = 39*(4\u221a30 + b + c)/\u221a30.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, another idea: The formula that relates the distance from the inradius to a vertex is IA = \u221a(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2), as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nWe found IA = sqrt(156), so IA\u00b2 = 156.\n\nSo,\n\n156 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nWe know r =6, so r\u00b2 =36.\n\nSo,\n\n156 = 36 + (s - a)^2.\n\nSo,\n\n(s - a)^2 = 156 -36 = 120.\n\nSo,\n\ns - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s = a + 2\u221a30.\n\nBut a is 4\u221a30, so:\n\ns = 4\u221a30 + 2\u221a30 = 6\u221a30.\n\nSo, the semiperimeter s is 6\u221a30.\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2 = 6\u221a30.\n\nSo,\n\na + b + c = 12\u221a30.\n\nSince a is 4\u221a30, that gives:\n\n4\u221a30 + b + c = 12\u221a30.\n\nTherefore,\n\nb + c = 8\u221a30.\n\nSo, we have another equation: b + c = 8\u221a30.\n\nAnd earlier, from the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nSo, now, let's let x = bc, and y = b + c =8\u221a30.\n\nWe also know that b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (b + c)^2 - 2bc = y\u00b2 - 2x.\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\n480 = (y\u00b2 - 2x) - (14/13) x.\n\nSo,\n\n480 = y\u00b2 - 2x - (14/13)x.\n\nCombine the x terms:\n\n-2x - (14/13)x = - (26/13 +14/13)x = - (40/13)x.\n\nSo,\n\n480 = y\u00b2 - (40/13)x.\n\nWe know y =8\u221a30, so y\u00b2 = (8\u221a30)^2 =64 *30= 1920.\n\nSo,\n\n480 = 1920 - (40/13)x.\n\nRearranging,\n\n(40/13)x = 1920 -480 =1440.\n\nSo,\n\nx = (1440 *13)/40.\n\nSimplify:\n\n1440 /40 = 36, so x= 36 *13=468.\n\nSo, x=468.\n\nBut x = bc, so bc=468.\n\nWhich is the product AB\u00b7AC = c\u00b7b=468.\n\nSo, the answer is 468.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) has a circumradius \\( R = 13 \\) and an inradius \\( r = 6 \\). The condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) implies that triangle \\( \\triangle IOA \\) is right-angled at \\( I \\). Using Euler's formula, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is \\( \\sqrt{R(R - 2r)} = \\sqrt{13} \\).\n\nApplying the Pythagorean theorem in \\( \\triangle IOA \\):\n\\[\nOA^2 = IO^2 + IA^2 \\implies 13^2 = (\\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \\implies IA^2 = 156 \\implies IA = \\sqrt{156}.\n\\]\n\nThe distance from the incenter to vertex \\( A \\) is given by \\( IA = \\frac{r}{\\sin(A/2)} \\). Substituting \\( IA = \\sqrt{156} \\) and \\( r = 6 \\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{156} = \\frac{6}{\\sin(A/2)} \\implies \\sin(A/2) = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{156}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the double-angle identity for cosine:\n\\[\n\\cos A = 1 - 2\\sin^2(A/2) = 1 - 2\\left(\\frac{39}{169}\\right) = \\frac{7}{13}.\n\\]\n\nThe side \\( a \\) (opposite angle \\( A \\)) is found using the Law of Sines:\n\\[\na = 2R \\sin A = 2 \\times 13 \\times \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13} = 4\\sqrt{30}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the semiperimeter \\( s \\) and the fact that \\( s - a = 2\\sqrt{30} \\) (from \\( IA^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2 \\)). Thus:\n\\[\ns = a + 2\\sqrt{30} = 4\\sqrt{30} + 2\\sqrt{30} = 6\\sqrt{30}.\n\\]\n\nThe perimeter is \\( a + b + c = 12\\sqrt{30} \\), so \\( b + c = 8\\sqrt{30} \\).\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines:\n\\[\na^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A \\implies 480 = b^2 + c^2 - \\frac{14}{13}bc.\n\\]\n\nLet \\( x = bc \\) and \\( y = b + c = 8\\sqrt{30} \\). Then:\n\\[\nb^2 + c^2 = y^2 - 2x = 1920 - 2x.\n\\]\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\\[\n480 = 1920 - 2x - \\frac{14}{13}x \\implies 480 = 1920 - \\frac{40}{13}x \\implies x = 468.\n\\]\n\nThus, the product \\( AB \\cdot AC = bc = 468 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{468}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find AB multiplied by AC in triangle ABC. Let me jot down the given information first to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nThe triangle ABC has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nHmm, let's start by recalling what circumradius and inradius mean. The circumradius (R) is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. So R = 13 and r = 6.\n\nGiven that IA is perpendicular to OI, that seems like an important condition. Maybe I can use some properties or theorems related to triangle centers and their perpendicularity.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the incenter (I) is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumcenter (O) is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors. So, O and I are two different centers unless the triangle is equilateral, which it probably isn't here since R and r are different.\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe I can use coordinates or vector methods to model this situation. Alternatively, perhaps there's a synthetic geometry approach.\n\nWait, maybe I can use coordinate geometry here. Let's try to set up a coordinate system where O is at the origin. Then, point I would be somewhere else, and IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nIf O is at (0,0), then the vector OI would be the position vector of I, say (x, y). Then, the vector IA would be from I to A, which is (a_x - x, a_y - y). For IA to be perpendicular to OI, their dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, (x)(a_x - x) + (y)(a_y - y) = 0.\n\nBut I don't know the coordinates of A, so maybe this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r)\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. I recall that OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Hmm, actually, I think the formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Let me double-check.\n\nYes, the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So plugging in the given values:\n\nOI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13.\n\nSo OI = sqrt(13).\n\nNow, IA is perpendicular to OI. So triangle OIA is a right triangle with right angle at A.\n\nWait, no. IA is perpendicular to OI, so point A lies somewhere such that IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, maybe I can model this using vectors or coordinate geometry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use trigonometric identities or triangle properties.\n\nWait, another thought: in triangle ABC, the inradius r = 6, and the area is r*s, where s is the semi-perimeter. Also, the area is (abc)/(4R). So maybe I can relate these to find some relations between the sides.\n\nLet me denote the sides as a, b, c, opposite to angles A, B, C respectively. So, BC = a, AC = b, AB = c.\n\nThe semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nThe area is r*s = 6s.\n\nAlso, the area is (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nHmm, so 6s = (a b c)/52.\n\nSo, 6*(a + b + c)/2 = (a b c)/52.\n\nSimplify left side: 3(a + b + c) = (a b c)/52.\n\nSo, 3*52*(a + b + c) = a b c.\n\nWhich simplifies to 156(a + b + c) = a b c.\n\nHmm, that's one equation.\n\nBut I need another relation. Maybe the fact that IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nI think I need to find some relation involving IA and OI.\n\nWait, IA is the distance from inradius to vertex A, right? Wait, no. IA is the segment from incenter I to vertex A. So, IA is the length from I to A.\n\nWait, but how can I find IA?\n\nI recall that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for IA in terms of the sides and angles.\n\nYes, I think the formula is IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)).\n\nWait, let me verify that. The distance from the incenter to vertex A is indeed IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)). Is that correct?\n\nWait, no, maybe it's r / sin(A/2). Let me think.\n\nIn the inradius, the inradius is given by r = (Area)/s. Also, in the formula, the distance from the inradius to vertex can be expressed using trigonometric functions.\n\nAlternatively, in triangle AIF, where F is the point where the incircle touches BC, angle IAF is equal to A/2.\n\nSo, in triangle AIF, sin(A/2) = r / IA.\n\nSo, IA = r / sin(A/2).\n\nYes, that seems right. So IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nSimilarly, I can express IB and IC in terms of angles as well.\n\nNow, since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to use this condition.\n\nAlternatively, since OI is the line connecting circumradius and inradius, and IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe we can use Pythagoras in triangle OIA.\n\nWait, triangle OIA is a right triangle at A, so OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nWait, OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, OA\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169.\n\nOI\u00b2 is 13, as calculated earlier. IA\u00b2 is (6 / sin(A/2))\u00b2.\n\nSo, 169 = 13 + IA\u00b2.\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = 169 - 13 = 156.\n\nSo, IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nBut IA is also equal to 6 / sin(A/2). So,\n\n2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2)\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = (3*sqrt(39))/39 = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nWait, because 3/sqrt(39) can be rationalized: 3*sqrt(39)/(sqrt(39)*sqrt(39)) = 3*sqrt(39)/39 = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nNow, from this, I can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 = 1.\n\nSo, cos\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nNow, let's think about the sides. We have formulas that relate the inradius, semiperimeter, and the angles.\n\nWait, the formula for the area is r*s = 6s.\n\nAlso, area is (1/2)*ab*sin C, but that might not directly help here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the circumradius: R = a/(2 sin A). Wait, yes, the formula is a = 2R sin A.\n\nSo, a = 2*13*sin A = 26 sin A.\n\nSimilarly, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nHmm, maybe I can express the semiperimeter s in terms of the angles.\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2 = 13(sin A + sin B + sin C).\n\nAlso, the area is 6s = 6*13*(sin A + sin B + sin C) = 78(sin A + sin B + sin C).\n\nBut the area is also (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a b c)/(52). So,\n\n78(sin A + sin B + sin C) = (a b c)/52.\n\nBut a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSo, a b c = 26^3 sin A sin B sin C.\n\nTherefore, 78(sin A + sin B + sin C) = (26^3 sin A sin B sin C)/52.\n\nSimplify right side: 26^3 / 52 = (26^3)/(2*26) )= (26^2)/2 = (676)/2 = 338.\n\nSo, 78(sin A + sin B + sin C) = 338 sin A sin B sin C.\n\nDivide both sides by 2: 39(sin A + sin B + sin C) = 169 sin A sin B sin C.\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps directly. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nWait, earlier I found that sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. So, A/2 is an angle whose sine is sqrt(39)/13.\n\nI can find cos A using the double-angle formula:\n\ncos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 - 78)/169 = 91/169 = 7*13 / (13*13) = 7/13.\n\nWait, 91 is 7*13, and 169 is 13\u00b2, so yes, 91/169 = 7/13.\n\nSo, cos A = 7/13.\n\nAlso, sin A = sqrt(1 - cos\u00b2 A) = sqrt(1 - 49/169) = sqrt(120/169) = (2*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nTherefore, side a = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, a = 4 sqrt(30). That's BC.\n\nNow, we need to find AB \u00b7 AC, which is c \u00b7 b.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, AB is opposite to angle C, which is c. AC is opposite to angle B, which is b. So, AB = c, AC = b.\n\nSo, AB \u00b7 AC = b c.\n\nWe can express b and c in terms of the angles:\n\nb = 2R sin B = 26 sin B\n\nc = 26 sin C\n\nSo, bc = 26^2 sin B sin C = 676 sin B sin C.\n\nHmm, if I can find sin B sin C, then I can find bc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find expressions involving angles B and C.\n\nWe know that in a triangle, angles sum to 180 degrees, so A + B + C = \u03c0.\n\nWe already found cos A = 7/13, sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, angles B and C are related. Let me think about other relations.\n\nWait, also, the semiperimeter s is related to the inradius r and the area.\n\nWe have s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nBut a = 4 sqrt(30), and b and c are 26 sin B and 26 sin C.\n\nSo, s = (4 sqrt(30) + 26 sin B + 26 sin C)/2 = 2 sqrt(30) + 13 (sin B + sin C).\n\nAlso, the area is r*s = 6*(2 sqrt(30) + 13 (sin B + sin C)).\n\nBut the area is also (a b c)/(4R) = (4 sqrt(30) * 26 sin B * 26 sin C)/(4*13).\n\nSimplify that:\n\n(4 sqrt(30) * 26 * 26 sin B sin C) / (52)\n\nSimplify denominator: 4*13=52.\n\nSo, numerator: 4 sqrt(30) * 26 *26 = 4 sqrt(30) * 676.\n\nWait, 26*26=676, yes.\n\nSo, numerator: 4 sqrt(30) * 676 sin B sin C.\n\nSo, (4 sqrt(30)*676 sin B sin C)/52 = (4 sqrt(30)*13 sin B sin C) = 52 sqrt(30) sin B sin C.\n\nSo, the area is 52 sqrt(30) sin B sin C.\n\nBut also, the area is 6*(2 sqrt(30) + 13 (sin B + sin C)).\n\nSo, equating the two expressions for area:\n\n52 sqrt(30) sin B sin C = 6*(2 sqrt(30) + 13 (sin B + sin C)).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n52 sqrt(30) sin B sin C = 12 sqrt(30) + 78 (sin B + sin C).\n\nHmm, that's one equation. But we have two variables, sin B and sin C. So, perhaps another equation is needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express sin B + sin C and sin B sin C in terms of angle A.\n\nSince A + B + C = \u03c0, we can let B + C = \u03c0 - A.\n\nSo, sin B + sin C = 2 sin( (B + C)/2 ) cos( (B - C)/2 ) = 2 sin( (\u03c0 - A)/2 ) cos( (B - C)/2 ).\n\nSimilarly, sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)] / 2.\n\nBut cos(B + C) = cos(\u03c0 - A) = -cos A = -7/13.\n\nSo, sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - (-7/13)] / 2 = [cos(B - C) + 7/13]/2.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too involved. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nWait, another thought: since we know cos A, perhaps we can use the Law of Cosines on angle A.\n\nLaw of Cosines: a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nWe know a = 4 sqrt(30), so a\u00b2 = 16*30 = 480.\n\nSo, 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13).\n\nRearranged: b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc = 480.\n\nHmm, but I need to find bc. Maybe I can find another equation involving b and c.\n\nWait, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = 2 sqrt(30) + 13 (sin B + sin C).\n\nBut I also have the area expressed as 6s = 78 (sin A + sin B + sin C).\n\nWait, earlier we had:\n\n78(sin A + sin B + sin C) = 338 sin A sin B sin C.\n\nWe found sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, let's plug that in:\n\n78*( (2 sqrt(30)/13) + sin B + sin C ) = 338*( (2 sqrt(30)/13 ) sin B sin C ).\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nLeft side: 78*(2 sqrt(30)/13 + sin B + sin C ) = 78*(2 sqrt(30)/13) + 78*(sin B + sin C ) = (78*2 sqrt(30))/13 + 78*(sin B + sin C ) = (6*2 sqrt(30)) + 78*(sin B + sin C ) = 12 sqrt(30) + 78*(sin B + sin C ).\n\nRight side: 338*(2 sqrt(30)/13) sin B sin C = (338/13)*2 sqrt(30) sin B sin C = 26*2 sqrt(30) sin B sin C = 52 sqrt(30) sin B sin C.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n12 sqrt(30) + 78*(sin B + sin C ) = 52 sqrt(30) sin B sin C.\n\nWait, but that's the same equation I had earlier. So, no progress there.\n\nHmm, maybe I can find expressions for sin B and sin C in terms of each other.\n\nSince A + B + C = \u03c0, and I know angle A, perhaps I can let B = something and express C accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the inradius in terms of the sides.\n\nThe inradius r = (Area)/s = 6.\n\nWe have Area = 6s.\n\nBut from Law of Cosines, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nWe have a = 4 sqrt(30), so a\u00b2 = 480.\n\nSo, 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nHmm, that's one equation.\n\nAlso, from the area, Area = (1/2) bc sin A = (1/2) bc*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = (sqrt(30)/13) bc.\n\nBut Area is also equal to 6s.\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, 6s = 6*(4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2 = 3*(4 sqrt(30) + b + c) = 12 sqrt(30) + 3b + 3c.\n\nSo, (sqrt(30)/13) bc = 12 sqrt(30) + 3b + 3c.\n\nMultiply both sides by 13 to eliminate the denominator:\n\nsqrt(30) bc = 156 sqrt(30) + 39b + 39c.\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(30):\n\nbc = 156 + (39b + 39c)/sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, that's another equation.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1. b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc = 480.\n\n2. bc = 156 + (39b + 39c)/sqrt(30).\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated, but maybe I can substitute bc from equation 2 into equation 1.\n\nLet me denote bc = 156 + k, where k = (39b + 39c)/sqrt(30).\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13)(156 + k) = 480.\n\nSimplify:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13)*156 - (14/13)k = 480.\n\nCalculate (14/13)*156: 14*156 /13. 156 divided by 13 is 12. So, 14*12=168.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 168 - (14/13)k = 480.\n\nSo, b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 480 + 168 + (14/13)k = 648 + (14/13)k.\n\nBut k = (39b + 39c)/sqrt(30) = 39(b + c)/sqrt(30).\n\nSo, (14/13)k = (14/13)*(39(b + c)/sqrt(30)) = (14*39)/(13 sqrt(30)) (b + c).\n\nSimplify 39/13 = 3, so:\n\n(14*3)/(sqrt(30)) (b + c) = (42)/sqrt(30) (b + c).\n\nSo, equation 1 now:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 648 + (42/sqrt(30))(b + c).\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can find another relation.\n\nWait, I also have the area expressed as (sqrt(30)/13) bc = 6s = 12 sqrt(30) + 3b + 3c.\n\nWait, that's equation 2 again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express (b + c) in terms of s.\n\nSince s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, b + c = 2s - 4 sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, but s is (a + b + c)/2, which is (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, perhaps I can find b + c in terms of s, but I don't see an immediate way to link that.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me denote x = b + c and y = bc. Then, I can write the equations in terms of x and y.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) y = 480.\n\nBut b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (b + c)^2 - 2 bc = x\u00b2 - 2 y.\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2 y - (14/13) y = 480.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx\u00b2 - (2 + 14/13) y = 480.\n\nConvert 2 to 26/13, so 2 +14/13 = (26 +14)/13 = 40/13.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 - (40/13) y = 480. Equation 1a.\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\ny = 156 + (39x)/sqrt(30).\n\nBecause 39b +39c = 39x, so 39x/sqrt(30) = (39/sqrt(30)) x.\n\nSo, equation 2a: y = 156 + (39/sqrt(30)) x.\n\nNow, substitute y from equation 2a into equation 1a.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 - (40/13)(156 + (39/sqrt(30)) x ) = 480.\n\nLet me compute (40/13)*156:\n\n40 * 156 /13 = 40 *12 = 480.\n\nAnd (40/13)*(39/sqrt(30)) x = (40 *39)/(13 sqrt(30)) x = (40 *3)/sqrt(30) x = (120)/sqrt(30) x.\n\nSimplify 120/sqrt(30):\n\n120/sqrt(30) = (120 sqrt(30))/30 = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 - [480 + 4 sqrt(30) x ] = 480.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 - 480 -4 sqrt(30) x = 480.\n\nBring 480 to the other side:\n\nx\u00b2 -4 sqrt(30) x - 960 = 0.\n\nSo, quadratic equation in x:\n\nx\u00b2 -4 sqrt(30) x -960 =0.\n\nWe can solve for x using quadratic formula.\n\nx = [4 sqrt(30) \u00b1 sqrt( (4 sqrt(30))\u00b2 + 4*960 ) ] / 2.\n\nCompute discriminant D:\n\n(4 sqrt(30))\u00b2 = 16*30=480.\n\n4*960=3840.\n\nSo, D=480 + 3840=4320.\n\nsqrt(4320). Let's factor 4320:\n\n4320 = 16 * 270 = 16 *9*30= 16*9*30= (4\u00b2)(3\u00b2)(30).\n\nSo, sqrt(4320) =4*3*sqrt(30)=12 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, x = [4 sqrt(30) \u00b112 sqrt(30)] / 2.\n\nCompute both possibilities:\n\nFirst, with the plus sign:\n\nx = [4 sqrt(30) +12 sqrt(30)] /2 = (16 sqrt(30))/2=8 sqrt(30).\n\nSecond, with the minus sign:\n\nx = [4 sqrt(30) -12 sqrt(30)] /2 = (-8 sqrt(30))/2= -4 sqrt(30).\n\nSince x = b + c, which is a sum of lengths, it can't be negative. So, x=8 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, b + c =8 sqrt(30).\n\nNow, from equation 2a: y=156 + (39/sqrt(30)) x.\n\nx=8 sqrt(30), so:\n\ny=156 + (39/sqrt(30)) *8 sqrt(30)=156 + 39*8=156 +312=468.\n\nSo, bc= y=468.\n\nTherefore, AB \u00b7 AC = bc =468.\n\nWait, that seems to be the answer.\n\nLet me just check if this makes sense.\n\nGiven that a =4 sqrt(30) \u2248 21.08, and b + c =8 sqrt(30)\u224843.44, and bc=468.\n\nSo, the sides b and c satisfy b + c \u224843.44 and bc=468.\n\nLet me compute the quadratic equation for b and c:\n\nLet b and c be the roots of t\u00b2 - (8 sqrt(30)) t +468=0.\n\nCompute discriminant D= (8 sqrt(30))\u00b2 -4*468=64*30 -1872=1920-1872=48.\n\nsqrt(48)=4 sqrt(3).\n\nSo, roots are [8 sqrt(30) \u00b14 sqrt(3)]/2=4 sqrt(30) \u00b12 sqrt(3).\n\nSo, sides b and c are 4 sqrt(30) +2 sqrt(3) and 4 sqrt(30) -2 sqrt(3).\n\nThese are positive, so that's good.\n\nNow, let's verify the Law of Cosines.\n\na\u00b2=480.\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -2 bc cos A.\n\nCompute b\u00b2 + c\u00b2:\n\n(4 sqrt(30) +2 sqrt(3))\u00b2 + (4 sqrt(30) -2 sqrt(3))\u00b2.\n\nExpand each:\n\nFirst term: (4 sqrt(30))\u00b2 + 2*(4 sqrt(30))(2 sqrt(3)) + (2 sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 16*30 + 16 sqrt(90) +4*3=480 + 16*3 sqrt(10) +12=492 +48 sqrt(10).\n\nSecond term: (4 sqrt(30))\u00b2 - 2*(4 sqrt(30))(2 sqrt(3)) + (2 sqrt(3))\u00b2=480 -16 sqrt(90) +12=492 -48 sqrt(10).\n\nAdd them together: 492 +48 sqrt(10) +492 -48 sqrt(10)=984.\n\nSo, b\u00b2 + c\u00b2=984.\n\nThen, 2 bc cos A =2*468*(7/13)=936*(7/13)=72*7=504.\n\nSo, b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -2 bc cos A=984-504=480, which matches a\u00b2=480.\n\nGreat, that checks out.\n\nSo, bc=468 is correct.\n\nTherefore, AB \u00b7 AC= bc=468.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find AB multiplied by AC in triangle ABC. Let me jot down the given information first to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nThe triangle ABC has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nHmm, let's start by recalling what circumradius and inradius mean. The circumradius (R) is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. So R = 13 and r = 6.\n\nGiven that IA is perpendicular to OI, that seems like an important condition. Maybe I can use some properties or theorems related to triangle centers and their perpendicularity.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the incenter (I) is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumcenter (O) is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors. So, O and I are two different centers unless the triangle is equilateral, which it probably isn't here since R and r are different.\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe I can use coordinates or vector methods to model this situation. Alternatively, perhaps there's a synthetic geometry approach.\n\nWait, maybe I can use coordinate geometry here. Let's try to set up a coordinate system where O is at the origin. Then, point I would be somewhere else, and IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nIf O is at (0,0), then the vector OI would be the position vector of I, say (x, y). Then, the vector IA would be from I to A, which is (a_x - x, a_y - y). For IA to be perpendicular to OI, their dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, (x)(a_x - x) + (y)(a_y - y) = 0.\n\nBut I don't know the coordinates of A, so maybe this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r)\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. I recall that OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Hmm, actually, I think the formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Let me double-check.\n\nYes, the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So plugging in the given values:\n\nOI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13.\n\nSo OI = sqrt(13).\n\nNow, IA is perpendicular to OI. So triangle OIA is a right triangle with right angle at A.\n\nWait, no. IA is perpendicular to OI, so point A lies somewhere such that IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, maybe I can model this using vectors or coordinate geometry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use trigonometric identities or triangle properties.\n\nWait, another thought: in triangle ABC, the inradius r = 6, and the area is r*s, where s is the semi-perimeter. Also, the area is (abc)/(4R). So maybe I can relate these to find some relations between the sides.\n\nLet me denote the sides as a, b, c, opposite to angles A, B, C respectively. So, BC = a, AC = b, AB = c.\n\nThe semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nThe area is r*s = 6s.\n\nAlso, the area is (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nHmm, so 6s = (a b c)/52.\n\nSo, 6*(a + b + c)/2 = (a b c)/52.\n\nSimplify left side: 3(a + b + c) = (a b c)/52.\n\nSo, 3*52*(a + b + c) = a b c.\n\nWhich simplifies to 156(a + b + c) = a b c.\n\nHmm, that's one equation.\n\nBut I need another relation. Maybe the fact that IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nI think I need to find some relation involving IA and OI.\n\nWait, IA is the distance from inradius to vertex A, right? Wait, no. IA is the segment from incenter I to vertex A. So, IA is the length from I to A.\n\nWait, but how can I find IA?\n\nI recall that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for IA in terms of the sides and angles.\n\nYes, I think the formula is IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)).\n\nWait, let me verify that. The distance from the incenter to vertex A is indeed IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)). Is that correct?\n\nWait, no, maybe it's r / sin(A/2). Let me think.\n\nIn the inradius, the inradius is given by r = (Area)/s. Also, in the formula, the distance from the inradius to vertex can be expressed using trigonometric functions.\n\nAlternatively, in triangle AIF, where F is the point where the incircle touches BC, angle IAF is equal to A/2.\n\nSo, in triangle AIF, sin(A/2) = r / IA.\n\nSo, IA = r / sin(A/2).\n\nYes, that seems right. So IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nSimilarly, I can express IB and IC in terms of angles as well.\n\nNow, since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to use this condition.\n\nAlternatively, since OI is the line connecting circumradius and inradius, and IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe we can use Pythagoras in triangle OIA.\n\nWait, triangle OIA is a right triangle at A, so OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nWait, OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, OA\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169.\n\nOI\u00b2 is 13, as calculated earlier. IA\u00b2 is (6 / sin(A/2))\u00b2.\n\nSo, 169 = 13 + IA\u00b2.\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = 169 - 13 = 156.\n\nSo, IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nBut IA is also equal to 6 / sin(A/2). So,\n\n2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2)\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = (3*sqrt(39))/39 = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nWait, because 3/sqrt(39) can be rationalized: 3*sqrt(39)/(sqrt(39)*sqrt(39)) = 3*sqrt(39)/39 = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nNow, from this, I can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 = 1.\n\nSo, cos\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nNow, let's think about the sides. We have formulas that relate the inradius, semiperimeter, and the angles.\n\nWait, the formula for the area is r*s = 6s.\n\nAlso, area is (1/2)*ab*sin C, but that might not directly help here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the circumradius: R = a/(2 sin A). Wait, yes, the formula is a = 2R sin A.\n\nSo, a = 2*13*sin A = 26 sin A.\n\nSimilarly, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nHmm, maybe I can express the semiperimeter s in terms of the angles.\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2 = 13(sin A + sin B + sin C).\n\nAlso, the area is 6s = 6*13*(sin A + sin B + sin C) = 78(sin A + sin B + sin C).\n\nBut the area is also (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a b c)/(52). So,\n\n78(sin A + sin B + sin C) = (a b c)/52.\n\nBut a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSo, a b c = 26^3 sin A sin B sin C.\n\nTherefore, 78(sin A + sin B + sin C) = (26^3 sin A sin B sin C)/52.\n\nSimplify right side: 26^3 / 52 = (26^3)/(2*26) )= (26^2)/2 = (676)/2 = 338.\n\nSo, 78(sin A + sin B + sin C) = 338 sin A sin B sin C.\n\nDivide both sides by 2: 39(sin A + sin B + sin C) = 169 sin A sin B sin C.\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps directly. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nWait, earlier I found that sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. So, A/2 is an angle whose sine is sqrt(39)/13.\n\nI can find cos A using the double-angle formula:\n\ncos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 - 78)/169 = 91/169 = 7*13 / (13*13) = 7/13.\n\nWait, 91 is 7*13, and 169 is 13\u00b2, so yes, 91/169 = 7/13.\n\nSo, cos A = 7/13.\n\nAlso, sin A = sqrt(1 - cos\u00b2 A) = sqrt(1 - 49/169) = sqrt(120/169) = (2*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nTherefore, side a = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, a = 4 sqrt(30). That's BC.\n\nNow, we need to find AB \u00b7 AC, which is c \u00b7 b.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, AB is opposite to angle C, which is c. AC is opposite to angle B, which is b. So, AB = c, AC = b.\n\nSo, AB \u00b7 AC = b c.\n\nWe can express b and c in terms of the angles:\n\nb = 2R sin B = 26 sin B\n\nc = 26 sin C\n\nSo, bc = 26^2 sin B sin C = 676 sin B sin C.\n\nHmm, if I can find sin B sin C, then I can find bc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find expressions involving angles B and C.\n\nWe know that in a triangle, angles sum to 180 degrees, so A + B + C = \u03c0.\n\nWe already found cos A = 7/13, sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, angles B and C are related. Let me think about other relations.\n\nWait, also, the semiperimeter s is related to the inradius r and the area.\n\nWe have s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nBut a = 4 sqrt(30), and b and c are 26 sin B and 26 sin C.\n\nSo, s = (4 sqrt(30) + 26 sin B + 26 sin C)/2 = 2 sqrt(30) + 13 (sin B + sin C).\n\nAlso, the area is r*s = 6*(2 sqrt(30) + 13 (sin B + sin C)).\n\nBut the area is also (a b c)/(4R) = (4 sqrt(30) * 26 sin B * 26 sin C)/(4*13).\n\nSimplify that:\n\n(4 sqrt(30) * 26 * 26 sin B sin C) / (52)\n\nSimplify denominator: 4*13=52.\n\nSo, numerator: 4 sqrt(30) * 26 *26 = 4 sqrt(30) * 676.\n\nWait, 26*26=676, yes.\n\nSo, numerator: 4 sqrt(30) * 676 sin B sin C.\n\nSo, (4 sqrt(30)*676 sin B sin C)/52 = (4 sqrt(30)*13 sin B sin C) = 52 sqrt(30) sin B sin C.\n\nSo, the area is 52 sqrt(30) sin B sin C.\n\nBut also, the area is 6*(2 sqrt(30) + 13 (sin B + sin C)).\n\nSo, equating the two expressions for area:\n\n52 sqrt(30) sin B sin C = 6*(2 sqrt(30) + 13 (sin B + sin C)).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n52 sqrt(30) sin B sin C = 12 sqrt(30) + 78 (sin B + sin C).\n\nHmm, that's one equation. But we have two variables, sin B and sin C. So, perhaps another equation is needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express sin B + sin C and sin B sin C in terms of angle A.\n\nSince A + B + C = \u03c0, we can let B + C = \u03c0 - A.\n\nSo, sin B + sin C = 2 sin( (B + C)/2 ) cos( (B - C)/2 ) = 2 sin( (\u03c0 - A)/2 ) cos( (B - C)/2 ).\n\nSimilarly, sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)] / 2.\n\nBut cos(B + C) = cos(\u03c0 - A) = -cos A = -7/13.\n\nSo, sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - (-7/13)] / 2 = [cos(B - C) + 7/13]/2.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too involved. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nWait, another thought: since we know cos A, perhaps we can use the Law of Cosines on angle A.\n\nLaw of Cosines: a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nWe know a = 4 sqrt(30), so a\u00b2 = 16*30 = 480.\n\nSo, 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13).\n\nRearranged: b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc = 480.\n\nHmm, but I need to find bc. Maybe I can find another equation involving b and c.\n\nWait, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = 2 sqrt(30) + 13 (sin B + sin C).\n\nBut I also have the area expressed as 6s = 78 (sin A + sin B + sin C).\n\nWait, earlier we had:\n\n78(sin A + sin B + sin C) = 338 sin A sin B sin C.\n\nWe found sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, let's plug that in:\n\n78*( (2 sqrt(30)/13) + sin B + sin C ) = 338*( (2 sqrt(30)/13 ) sin B sin C ).\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nLeft side: 78*(2 sqrt(30)/13 + sin B + sin C ) = 78*(2 sqrt(30)/13) + 78*(sin B + sin C ) = (78*2 sqrt(30))/13 + 78*(sin B + sin C ) = (6*2 sqrt(30)) + 78*(sin B + sin C ) = 12 sqrt(30) + 78*(sin B + sin C ).\n\nRight side: 338*(2 sqrt(30)/13) sin B sin C = (338/13)*2 sqrt(30) sin B sin C = 26*2 sqrt(30) sin B sin C = 52 sqrt(30) sin B sin C.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n12 sqrt(30) + 78*(sin B + sin C ) = 52 sqrt(30) sin B sin C.\n\nWait, but that's the same equation I had earlier. So, no progress there.\n\nHmm, maybe I can find expressions for sin B and sin C in terms of each other.\n\nSince A + B + C = \u03c0, and I know angle A, perhaps I can let B = something and express C accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the inradius in terms of the sides.\n\nThe inradius r = (Area)/s = 6.\n\nWe have Area = 6s.\n\nBut from Law of Cosines, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nWe have a = 4 sqrt(30), so a\u00b2 = 480.\n\nSo, 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nHmm, that's one equation.\n\nAlso, from the area, Area = (1/2) bc sin A = (1/2) bc*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = (sqrt(30)/13) bc.\n\nBut Area is also equal to 6s.\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, 6s = 6*(4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2 = 3*(4 sqrt(30) + b + c) = 12 sqrt(30) + 3b + 3c.\n\nSo, (sqrt(30)/13) bc = 12 sqrt(30) + 3b + 3c.\n\nMultiply both sides by 13 to eliminate the denominator:\n\nsqrt(30) bc = 156 sqrt(30) + 39b + 39c.\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(30):\n\nbc = 156 + (39b + 39c)/sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, that's another equation.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1. b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc = 480.\n\n2. bc = 156 + (39b + 39c)/sqrt(30).\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated, but maybe I can substitute bc from equation 2 into equation 1.\n\nLet me denote bc = 156 + k, where k = (39b + 39c)/sqrt(30).\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13)(156 + k) = 480.\n\nSimplify:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13)*156 - (14/13)k = 480.\n\nCalculate (14/13)*156: 14*156 /13. 156 divided by 13 is 12. So, 14*12=168.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 168 - (14/13)k = 480.\n\nSo, b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 480 + 168 + (14/13)k = 648 + (14/13)k.\n\nBut k = (39b + 39c)/sqrt(30) = 39(b + c)/sqrt(30).\n\nSo, (14/13)k = (14/13)*(39(b + c)/sqrt(30)) = (14*39)/(13 sqrt(30)) (b + c).\n\nSimplify 39/13 = 3, so:\n\n(14*3)/(sqrt(30)) (b + c) = (42)/sqrt(30) (b + c).\n\nSo, equation 1 now:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 648 + (42/sqrt(30))(b + c).\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can find another relation.\n\nWait, I also have the area expressed as (sqrt(30)/13) bc = 6s = 12 sqrt(30) + 3b + 3c.\n\nWait, that's equation 2 again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express (b + c) in terms of s.\n\nSince s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, b + c = 2s - 4 sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, but s is (a + b + c)/2, which is (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, perhaps I can find b + c in terms of s, but I don't see an immediate way to link that.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me denote x = b + c and y = bc. Then, I can write the equations in terms of x and y.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) y = 480.\n\nBut b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (b + c)^2 - 2 bc = x\u00b2 - 2 y.\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2 y - (14/13) y = 480.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx\u00b2 - (2 + 14/13) y = 480.\n\nConvert 2 to 26/13, so 2 +14/13 = (26 +14)/13 = 40/13.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 - (40/13) y = 480. Equation 1a.\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\ny = 156 + (39x)/sqrt(30).\n\nBecause 39b +39c = 39x, so 39x/sqrt(30) = (39/sqrt(30)) x.\n\nSo, equation 2a: y = 156 + (39/sqrt(30)) x.\n\nNow, substitute y from equation 2a into equation 1a.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 - (40/13)(156 + (39/sqrt(30)) x ) = 480.\n\nLet me compute (40/13)*156:\n\n40 * 156 /13 = 40 *12 = 480.\n\nAnd (40/13)*(39/sqrt(30)) x = (40 *39)/(13 sqrt(30)) x = (40 *3)/sqrt(30) x = (120)/sqrt(30) x.\n\nSimplify 120/sqrt(30):\n\n120/sqrt(30) = (120 sqrt(30))/30 = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 - [480 + 4 sqrt(30) x ] = 480.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 - 480 -4 sqrt(30) x = 480.\n\nBring 480 to the other side:\n\nx\u00b2 -4 sqrt(30) x - 960 = 0.\n\nSo, quadratic equation in x:\n\nx\u00b2 -4 sqrt(30) x -960 =0.\n\nWe can solve for x using quadratic formula.\n\nx = [4 sqrt(30) \u00b1 sqrt( (4 sqrt(30))\u00b2 + 4*960 ) ] / 2.\n\nCompute discriminant D:\n\n(4 sqrt(30))\u00b2 = 16*30=480.\n\n4*960=3840.\n\nSo, D=480 + 3840=4320.\n\nsqrt(4320). Let's factor 4320:\n\n4320 = 16 * 270 = 16 *9*30= 16*9*30= (4\u00b2)(3\u00b2)(30).\n\nSo, sqrt(4320) =4*3*sqrt(30)=12 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, x = [4 sqrt(30) \u00b112 sqrt(30)] / 2.\n\nCompute both possibilities:\n\nFirst, with the plus sign:\n\nx = [4 sqrt(30) +12 sqrt(30)] /2 = (16 sqrt(30))/2=8 sqrt(30).\n\nSecond, with the minus sign:\n\nx = [4 sqrt(30) -12 sqrt(30)] /2 = (-8 sqrt(30))/2= -4 sqrt(30).\n\nSince x = b + c, which is a sum of lengths, it can't be negative. So, x=8 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, b + c =8 sqrt(30).\n\nNow, from equation 2a: y=156 + (39/sqrt(30)) x.\n\nx=8 sqrt(30), so:\n\ny=156 + (39/sqrt(30)) *8 sqrt(30)=156 + 39*8=156 +312=468.\n\nSo, bc= y=468.\n\nTherefore, AB \u00b7 AC = bc =468.\n\nWait, that seems to be the answer.\n\nLet me just check if this makes sense.\n\nGiven that a =4 sqrt(30) \u2248 21.08, and b + c =8 sqrt(30)\u224843.44, and bc=468.\n\nSo, the sides b and c satisfy b + c \u224843.44 and bc=468.\n\nLet me compute the quadratic equation for b and c:\n\nLet b and c be the roots of t\u00b2 - (8 sqrt(30)) t +468=0.\n\nCompute discriminant D= (8 sqrt(30))\u00b2 -4*468=64*30 -1872=1920-1872=48.\n\nsqrt(48)=4 sqrt(3).\n\nSo, roots are [8 sqrt(30) \u00b14 sqrt(3)]/2=4 sqrt(30) \u00b12 sqrt(3).\n\nSo, sides b and c are 4 sqrt(30) +2 sqrt(3) and 4 sqrt(30) -2 sqrt(3).\n\nThese are positive, so that's good.\n\nNow, let's verify the Law of Cosines.\n\na\u00b2=480.\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -2 bc cos A.\n\nCompute b\u00b2 + c\u00b2:\n\n(4 sqrt(30) +2 sqrt(3))\u00b2 + (4 sqrt(30) -2 sqrt(3))\u00b2.\n\nExpand each:\n\nFirst term: (4 sqrt(30))\u00b2 + 2*(4 sqrt(30))(2 sqrt(3)) + (2 sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 16*30 + 16 sqrt(90) +4*3=480 + 16*3 sqrt(10) +12=492 +48 sqrt(10).\n\nSecond term: (4 sqrt(30))\u00b2 - 2*(4 sqrt(30))(2 sqrt(3)) + (2 sqrt(3))\u00b2=480 -16 sqrt(90) +12=492 -48 sqrt(10).\n\nAdd them together: 492 +48 sqrt(10) +492 -48 sqrt(10)=984.\n\nSo, b\u00b2 + c\u00b2=984.\n\nThen, 2 bc cos A =2*468*(7/13)=936*(7/13)=72*7=504.\n\nSo, b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -2 bc cos A=984-504=480, which matches a\u00b2=480.\n\nGreat, that checks out.\n\nSo, bc=468 is correct.\n\nTherefore, AB \u00b7 AC= bc=468.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the circumradius \\( R = 13 \\) and the inradius \\( r = 6 \\). The condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) implies that triangle \\( OIA \\) is a right triangle with \\( \\angle IA O = 90^\\circ \\). Using the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter, \\( OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr \\), we find:\n\n\\[\nOI^2 = 13^2 - 2 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 6 = 169 - 156 = 13 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad OI = \\sqrt{13}.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\triangle OIA \\) is a right triangle, we apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\nOA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 13^2 = (\\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 169 = 13 + IA^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad IA^2 = 156 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad IA = 2\\sqrt{39}.\n\\]\n\nThe length \\( IA \\) can also be expressed as \\( IA = \\frac{r}{\\sin(A/2)} = \\frac{6}{\\sin(A/2)} \\). Equating the two expressions for \\( IA \\):\n\n\\[\n2\\sqrt{39} = \\frac{6}{\\sin(A/2)} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\sin(A/2) = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{39}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the double-angle identity for cosine:\n\n\\[\n\\cos A = 1 - 2\\sin^2(A/2) = 1 - 2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{78}{169} = \\frac{91}{169} = \\frac{7}{13}.\n\\]\n\nThe side \\( a = BC \\) is given by \\( a = 2R \\sin A \\). First, compute \\( \\sin A \\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin A = \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2 A} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{7}{13}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{120}{169}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13}.\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\na = 2 \\cdot 13 \\cdot \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13} = 4\\sqrt{30}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the relationship between the inradius, semiperimeter, and area. The semiperimeter \\( s \\) is:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{a + b + c}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThe area of the triangle can be expressed as \\( \\text{Area} = r \\cdot s = 6s \\) and also as \\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{abc}{4R} \\). Equating these:\n\n\\[\n6s = \\frac{abc}{52}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( a = 4\\sqrt{30} \\) and \\( R = 13 \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n6 \\cdot \\frac{4\\sqrt{30} + b + c}{2} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{30} \\cdot b \\cdot c}{52} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 3(4\\sqrt{30} + b + c) = \\frac{4\\sqrt{30} \\cdot bc}{52}.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying further, we find \\( bc = 468 \\). Therefore, the product \\( AB \\cdot AC = bc = 468 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{468}\n\\]",
