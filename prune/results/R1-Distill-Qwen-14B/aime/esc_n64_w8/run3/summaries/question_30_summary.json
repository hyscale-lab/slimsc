      "reasoning_text": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity because it's a root of unity and it's not equal to 1. That means \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k \u2260 1 for any k from 1 to 12. So, \u03c9^k for k=0 is 1, and then cycles through the other roots.\n\nThe product we're looking at is the product of terms of the form (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) for each k from 0 to 12. So, that's 13 terms multiplied together. Since we're dealing with roots of unity, perhaps there's a clever way to relate this product to some polynomial.\n\nLet me think: roots of unity are zeros of the cyclotomic polynomial. For a 13th root of unity, the minimal polynomial is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that directly helps here. Maybe I should consider the given expression and see if I can factor it or relate it to a known polynomial.\n\nLooking at the term (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), I notice that it's a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me write it as (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Hmm, maybe I can factor this quadratic or relate it to another expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of this as a quadratic equation in terms of \u03c9^k. Let me set x = \u03c9^k. Then each term becomes (x^2 - 2x + 2). So, the product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (x^2 - 2x + 2), where x = \u03c9^k.\n\nBut wait, x isn't just any variable; it's a 13th root of unity. So, maybe I can consider the product over all x where x^13 = 1, except x=1, but in our case, k goes from 0 to 12, so x includes 1 as well when k=0.\n\nWait, when k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1. So, substituting x=1 into (x^2 - 2x + 2) gives 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So, the first term in the product is 1. That simplifies things a bit because multiplying by 1 doesn't change the product. So, the product is essentially the product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nBut wait, perhaps I can express this product as evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points. Since \u03c9^k are the roots of \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. So, if I have a polynomial P(x) = something, and I evaluate it at each \u03c9^k, then the product over (x^2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at x=\u03c9^k would be the same as the product over (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). So, perhaps the product is equal to the product of (x^2 - 2x + 2) over all x such that x^13 = 1, except x=1. But since when k=0, it's 1, but as we saw, that term is 1, so it doesn't affect the product.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the product as the value of a polynomial evaluated at certain points. Specifically, the product over (x - a_k) is the same as the polynomial having roots at a_k. But here, it's not exactly that; it's the product of (2 - 2x + x^2) evaluated at each x=\u03c9^k.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write this product as the product of (x^2 - 2x + 2) over all x where x^13 = 1. So, the product would be equal to the product over x^13 =1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2). But since x^13 =1, perhaps I can relate this to a polynomial whose roots are x^2 - 2x + 2 evaluated at each x.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the product over all x^13 =1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the resultant of some polynomials or something else. Hmm, this is getting a bit abstract.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express (x^2 - 2x + 2) as (x - a)(x - b), but I'm not sure if that factors nicely. Let me compute the discriminant: D = 4 - 8 = -4. So, the roots would be [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, it factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, perhaps the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nWait, that sounds promising. Because if I have the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i)), that would be the value of the cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at (1 + i). Wait, but the cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6_13(x) is the minimal polynomial for primitive 13th roots of unity, which is (x^13 -1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nBut the product over all x^13=1 of (x - a) would be equal to (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1), assuming a \u2260 1. Because when you multiply (x - a) for all roots x of x^13=1, you get the polynomial x^13 -1, which factors as (x - 1)(x - \u03c9)(x - \u03c9^2)...(x - \u03c9^12). So, if a \u22601, then the product over x^13=1 of (x - a) = (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1).\n\nSo, applying that here, the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i)) is ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / (i). Similarly, the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 - i)) is ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( -i ).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the product over x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) is equal to [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / i ] * [ ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i) ].\n\nWait, let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i)) = [(1 + i)^13 -1]/( (1 + i) - 1 ) = [(1 + i)^13 -1]/(i).\n\nSimilarly, the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 - i)) = [(1 - i)^13 -1]/( (1 - i) - 1 ) = [(1 - i)^13 -1]/( -i ).\n\nSo, the total product is [ ((1 + i)^13 -1)/i ] * [ ((1 - i)^13 -1)/(-i) ].\n\nLet me compute this expression.\n\nFirst, note that 1 + i and 1 - i are complex conjugates. So, perhaps (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 are also complex conjugates. So, if I let A = (1 + i)^13, then (1 - i)^13 is the conjugate of A, which is A*.\n\nSo, the product becomes [ (A -1)/i ] * [ (A* -1)/(-i) ].\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n[ (A -1)(A* -1) ] / (i * (-i)) = [ (A -1)(A* -1) ] / (1) because i * (-i) = -i^2 = -(-1) =1.\n\nSo, it's just (A -1)(A* -1).\n\nExpanding this, we get A A* - A - A* +1.\n\nBut A A* is |A|^2, which is |(1 + i)^13|^2. Since |1 + i| = sqrt(2), |A| = (sqrt(2))^13 = (2)^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2). So, |A|^2 = (64 * sqrt(2))^2 = 4096 * 2 = 8192.\n\nNow, A + A* is 2 Re(A), which is 2 times the real part of (1 + i)^13.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(A -1)(A* -1) = |A|^2 - (A + A*) +1 = 8192 - 2 Re(A) +1 = 8193 - 2 Re(A).\n\nSo, I need to compute Re(A), which is the real part of (1 + i)^13.\n\nHmm, how can I compute (1 + i)^13?\n\nI know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. Since 1 + i has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the angle 13 * \u03c0/4. Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0 to find the equivalent angle.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0 (because 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0). So, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, 64 * sqrt(2) multiplied by (-sqrt(2)/2) is 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part is 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = same as above, which is -64. So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nTherefore, Re(A) = Re( (1 + i)^13 ) = -64.\n\nSo, putting it back into our expression:\n\n(A -1)(A* -1) = 8193 - 2*(-64) = 8193 + 128 = 8321.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 8193 + 128: 8193 + 100 is 8293, plus 28 is 8321. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product over x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) is 8321.\n\nBut wait, in our original problem, the product is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), which is the same as the product from x=\u03c9^0 to \u03c9^12 of (x^2 - 2x + 2). So, that product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When k=0, \u03c9^0=1, so (1)^2 - 2*(1) + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 =1. So, the product is indeed 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). But in my earlier approach, I considered all x^13=1, which includes x=1, so the product was 8321, which includes the term when x=1, which is 1. So, that matches.\n\nWait, but hold on a second: the product over x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) is 8321, which is the same as the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2), which is exactly what the problem is asking for. So, that product is 8321.\n\nWait, but 8321 is a 4-digit number. We need the remainder when this is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a miscalculation when computing (A -1)(A* -1). Because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, especially with high exponents, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nSo, let me go through that part again.\n\nWe had A = (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nSo, A -1 = (-64 -1) + (-64i) = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, A* is the conjugate of A, which is (-64 +64i). So, A* -1 = (-64 -1) +64i = -65 +64i.\n\nNow, multiplying (A -1)(A* -1) = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).\n\nThis is a product of the form (a - b)(a + b) where a = -65 and b = 64i. So, it's a^2 - b^2.\n\nCompute a^2: (-65)^2 = 4225.\n\nCompute b^2: (64i)^2 = 64^2 * i^2 = 4096*(-1) = -4096.\n\nSo, a^2 - b^2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the product is indeed 8321.\n\nSo, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321 because 8321 = 8*1000 + 321.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 8321 mod 1000. 8321 divided by 1000 is 8, and 8*1000 is 8000. Subtracting that from 8321 gives 321. So, yes, the remainder is 321.\n\nSo, the answer should be 321. But wait, let me check again if my initial approach is correct.\n\nI considered the product over all x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2). Since the given product is exactly that, as each term is evaluated at x=\u03c9^k for k from 0 to 12, which are all 13th roots of unity. So, the product is indeed 8321, which mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should think about whether the initial product is 8321 or something else. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step where I expressed the product as [ ((1 + i)^13 -1)/i ] * [ ((1 - i)^13 -1)/(-i) ].\n\nWait, let's compute that again.\n\nWe had:\n\nProduct over x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) = Product over x^13=1 of (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)) = [Product over x^13=1 (x - (1+i))] * [Product over x^13=1 (x - (1-i))].\n\nEach product is equal to ( (1+i)^13 -1 )/( (1+i) -1 ) and ( (1 -i)^13 -1 )/( (1 -i ) -1 ), respectively.\n\nSo, compute denominator for first term: (1 + i) -1 = i.\n\nDenominator for second term: (1 -i ) -1 = -i.\n\nSo, the two products are [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] / i and [ (1 -i )^13 -1 ] / (-i ).\n\nSo, the total product is [ ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) / i ] * [ ( (1 -i )^13 -1 ) / (-i ) ].\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i, as before.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 -i )^13 = (-64 +64i), so (1 -i )^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the first fraction is (-65 -64i)/i, and the second fraction is (-65 +64i)/(-i).\n\nLet me compute each fraction:\n\nFirst, (-65 -64i)/i. Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to rationalize the denominator.\n\nWait, alternatively, note that 1/i = -i, since i*(-i)=1.\n\nSo, (-65 -64i)/i = (-65 -64i)*(-i) = 65i +64i^2 = 65i -64.\n\nSimilarly, the second fraction is (-65 +64i)/(-i) = (-65 +64i)*i = -65i +64i^2 = -65i -64.\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy, but let's compute:\n\nFirst fraction: (-65 -64i)/i = multiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65i -64i^2)/ (i^2) = (-65i +64)/ (-1) = (64 -65i)/(-1) = -64 +65i.\n\nWait, wait, that's a different approach.\n\nWait, let me compute (-65 -64i)/i.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\nNumerator: (-65 -64i)*i = -65i -64i^2 = -65i +64.\n\nDenominator: i * i = i^2 = -1.\n\nSo, the fraction becomes (-65i +64)/(-1) = (64 -65i)/(-1) = -64 +65i.\n\nSimilarly, the second fraction: (-65 +64i)/(-i).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\nNumerator: (-65 +64i)*i = -65i +64i^2 = -65i -64.\n\nDenominator: (-i)*i = -i^2 = 1.\n\nSo, the fraction becomes (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.\n\nSo, now, the product is [ (-65 -64i)/i ] * [ (-65 +64i)/(-i) ] = (-64 +65i) * (-64 -65i).\n\nWait, because the first fraction was (-64 +65i) and the second was (-64 -65i).\n\nSo, multiplying these two complex numbers:\n\n(-64 +65i)(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225)(i^2) = 4096 - 4225*(-1) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nYes, same as before.\n\nSo, that confirms that the product is indeed 8321, and mod 1000 is 321.\n\nBut let me just make sure that I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents or in the initial steps. Because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, especially with high exponents, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, another way to compute (1 + i)^13 is to compute it using De Moivre's theorem.\n\nWe know that 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}, so raising it to the 13th power gives (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13:\n\nsqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nThen, 13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is the same as \u03c0/4 plus an odd multiple of \u03c0. Since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nCompute this:\n\n64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part is 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i, which matches what I had earlier.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is the conjugate, which is -64 +64i.\n\nSo, yeah, the calculations are consistent.\n\nTherefore, the product is 8321, which mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321 when divided by 1000.\n",

      "full_content": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity because it's a root of unity and it's not equal to 1. That means \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k \u2260 1 for any k from 1 to 12. So, \u03c9^k for k=0 is 1, and then cycles through the other roots.\n\nThe product we're looking at is the product of terms of the form (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) for each k from 0 to 12. So, that's 13 terms multiplied together. Since we're dealing with roots of unity, perhaps there's a clever way to relate this product to some polynomial.\n\nLet me think: roots of unity are zeros of the cyclotomic polynomial. For a 13th root of unity, the minimal polynomial is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that directly helps here. Maybe I should consider the given expression and see if I can factor it or relate it to a known polynomial.\n\nLooking at the term (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), I notice that it's a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me write it as (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Hmm, maybe I can factor this quadratic or relate it to another expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of this as a quadratic equation in terms of \u03c9^k. Let me set x = \u03c9^k. Then each term becomes (x^2 - 2x + 2). So, the product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (x^2 - 2x + 2), where x = \u03c9^k.\n\nBut wait, x isn't just any variable; it's a 13th root of unity. So, maybe I can consider the product over all x where x^13 = 1, except x=1, but in our case, k goes from 0 to 12, so x includes 1 as well when k=0.\n\nWait, when k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1. So, substituting x=1 into (x^2 - 2x + 2) gives 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So, the first term in the product is 1. That simplifies things a bit because multiplying by 1 doesn't change the product. So, the product is essentially the product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nBut wait, perhaps I can express this product as evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points. Since \u03c9^k are the roots of \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. So, if I have a polynomial P(x) = something, and I evaluate it at each \u03c9^k, then the product over (x^2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at x=\u03c9^k would be the same as the product over (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). So, perhaps the product is equal to the product of (x^2 - 2x + 2) over all x such that x^13 = 1, except x=1. But since when k=0, it's 1, but as we saw, that term is 1, so it doesn't affect the product.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the product as the value of a polynomial evaluated at certain points. Specifically, the product over (x - a_k) is the same as the polynomial having roots at a_k. But here, it's not exactly that; it's the product of (2 - 2x + x^2) evaluated at each x=\u03c9^k.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write this product as the product of (x^2 - 2x + 2) over all x where x^13 = 1. So, the product would be equal to the product over x^13 =1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2). But since x^13 =1, perhaps I can relate this to a polynomial whose roots are x^2 - 2x + 2 evaluated at each x.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the product over all x^13 =1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the resultant of some polynomials or something else. Hmm, this is getting a bit abstract.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express (x^2 - 2x + 2) as (x - a)(x - b), but I'm not sure if that factors nicely. Let me compute the discriminant: D = 4 - 8 = -4. So, the roots would be [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, it factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, perhaps the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nWait, that sounds promising. Because if I have the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i)), that would be the value of the cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at (1 + i). Wait, but the cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6_13(x) is the minimal polynomial for primitive 13th roots of unity, which is (x^13 -1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nBut the product over all x^13=1 of (x - a) would be equal to (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1), assuming a \u2260 1. Because when you multiply (x - a) for all roots x of x^13=1, you get the polynomial x^13 -1, which factors as (x - 1)(x - \u03c9)(x - \u03c9^2)...(x - \u03c9^12). So, if a \u22601, then the product over x^13=1 of (x - a) = (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1).\n\nSo, applying that here, the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i)) is ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / (i). Similarly, the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 - i)) is ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( -i ).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the product over x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) is equal to [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / i ] * [ ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i) ].\n\nWait, let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 + i)) = [(1 + i)^13 -1]/( (1 + i) - 1 ) = [(1 + i)^13 -1]/(i).\n\nSimilarly, the product over x^13=1 of (x - (1 - i)) = [(1 - i)^13 -1]/( (1 - i) - 1 ) = [(1 - i)^13 -1]/( -i ).\n\nSo, the total product is [ ((1 + i)^13 -1)/i ] * [ ((1 - i)^13 -1)/(-i) ].\n\nLet me compute this expression.\n\nFirst, note that 1 + i and 1 - i are complex conjugates. So, perhaps (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 are also complex conjugates. So, if I let A = (1 + i)^13, then (1 - i)^13 is the conjugate of A, which is A*.\n\nSo, the product becomes [ (A -1)/i ] * [ (A* -1)/(-i) ].\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n[ (A -1)(A* -1) ] / (i * (-i)) = [ (A -1)(A* -1) ] / (1) because i * (-i) = -i^2 = -(-1) =1.\n\nSo, it's just (A -1)(A* -1).\n\nExpanding this, we get A A* - A - A* +1.\n\nBut A A* is |A|^2, which is |(1 + i)^13|^2. Since |1 + i| = sqrt(2), |A| = (sqrt(2))^13 = (2)^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2). So, |A|^2 = (64 * sqrt(2))^2 = 4096 * 2 = 8192.\n\nNow, A + A* is 2 Re(A), which is 2 times the real part of (1 + i)^13.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(A -1)(A* -1) = |A|^2 - (A + A*) +1 = 8192 - 2 Re(A) +1 = 8193 - 2 Re(A).\n\nSo, I need to compute Re(A), which is the real part of (1 + i)^13.\n\nHmm, how can I compute (1 + i)^13?\n\nI know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. Since 1 + i has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the angle 13 * \u03c0/4. Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0 to find the equivalent angle.\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0 (because 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0). So, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, 64 * sqrt(2) multiplied by (-sqrt(2)/2) is 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part is 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = same as above, which is -64. So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nTherefore, Re(A) = Re( (1 + i)^13 ) = -64.\n\nSo, putting it back into our expression:\n\n(A -1)(A* -1) = 8193 - 2*(-64) = 8193 + 128 = 8321.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 8193 + 128: 8193 + 100 is 8293, plus 28 is 8321. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product over x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) is 8321.\n\nBut wait, in our original problem, the product is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), which is the same as the product from x=\u03c9^0 to \u03c9^12 of (x^2 - 2x + 2). So, that product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When k=0, \u03c9^0=1, so (1)^2 - 2*(1) + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 =1. So, the product is indeed 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). But in my earlier approach, I considered all x^13=1, which includes x=1, so the product was 8321, which includes the term when x=1, which is 1. So, that matches.\n\nWait, but hold on a second: the product over x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) is 8321, which is the same as the product from k=0 to 12 of (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2), which is exactly what the problem is asking for. So, that product is 8321.\n\nWait, but 8321 is a 4-digit number. We need the remainder when this is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a miscalculation when computing (A -1)(A* -1). Because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, especially with high exponents, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nSo, let me go through that part again.\n\nWe had A = (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nSo, A -1 = (-64 -1) + (-64i) = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, A* is the conjugate of A, which is (-64 +64i). So, A* -1 = (-64 -1) +64i = -65 +64i.\n\nNow, multiplying (A -1)(A* -1) = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).\n\nThis is a product of the form (a - b)(a + b) where a = -65 and b = 64i. So, it's a^2 - b^2.\n\nCompute a^2: (-65)^2 = 4225.\n\nCompute b^2: (64i)^2 = 64^2 * i^2 = 4096*(-1) = -4096.\n\nSo, a^2 - b^2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the product is indeed 8321.\n\nSo, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321 because 8321 = 8*1000 + 321.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 8321 mod 1000. 8321 divided by 1000 is 8, and 8*1000 is 8000. Subtracting that from 8321 gives 321. So, yes, the remainder is 321.\n\nSo, the answer should be 321. But wait, let me check again if my initial approach is correct.\n\nI considered the product over all x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2). Since the given product is exactly that, as each term is evaluated at x=\u03c9^k for k from 0 to 12, which are all 13th roots of unity. So, the product is indeed 8321, which mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should think about whether the initial product is 8321 or something else. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step where I expressed the product as [ ((1 + i)^13 -1)/i ] * [ ((1 - i)^13 -1)/(-i) ].\n\nWait, let's compute that again.\n\nWe had:\n\nProduct over x^13=1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2) = Product over x^13=1 of (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)) = [Product over x^13=1 (x - (1+i))] * [Product over x^13=1 (x - (1-i))].\n\nEach product is equal to ( (1+i)^13 -1 )/( (1+i) -1 ) and ( (1 -i)^13 -1 )/( (1 -i ) -1 ), respectively.\n\nSo, compute denominator for first term: (1 + i) -1 = i.\n\nDenominator for second term: (1 -i ) -1 = -i.\n\nSo, the two products are [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] / i and [ (1 -i )^13 -1 ] / (-i ).\n\nSo, the total product is [ ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) / i ] * [ ( (1 -i )^13 -1 ) / (-i ) ].\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i, as before.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 -i )^13 = (-64 +64i), so (1 -i )^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the first fraction is (-65 -64i)/i, and the second fraction is (-65 +64i)/(-i).\n\nLet me compute each fraction:\n\nFirst, (-65 -64i)/i. Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to rationalize the denominator.\n\nWait, alternatively, note that 1/i = -i, since i*(-i)=1.\n\nSo, (-65 -64i)/i = (-65 -64i)*(-i) = 65i +64i^2 = 65i -64.\n\nSimilarly, the second fraction is (-65 +64i)/(-i) = (-65 +64i)*i = -65i +64i^2 = -65i -64.\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy, but let's compute:\n\nFirst fraction: (-65 -64i)/i = multiply numerator and denominator by i: (-65i -64i^2)/ (i^2) = (-65i +64)/ (-1) = (64 -65i)/(-1) = -64 +65i.\n\nWait, wait, that's a different approach.\n\nWait, let me compute (-65 -64i)/i.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\nNumerator: (-65 -64i)*i = -65i -64i^2 = -65i +64.\n\nDenominator: i * i = i^2 = -1.\n\nSo, the fraction becomes (-65i +64)/(-1) = (64 -65i)/(-1) = -64 +65i.\n\nSimilarly, the second fraction: (-65 +64i)/(-i).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\nNumerator: (-65 +64i)*i = -65i +64i^2 = -65i -64.\n\nDenominator: (-i)*i = -i^2 = 1.\n\nSo, the fraction becomes (-65i -64)/1 = -64 -65i.\n\nSo, now, the product is [ (-65 -64i)/i ] * [ (-65 +64i)/(-i) ] = (-64 +65i) * (-64 -65i).\n\nWait, because the first fraction was (-64 +65i) and the second was (-64 -65i).\n\nSo, multiplying these two complex numbers:\n\n(-64 +65i)(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225)(i^2) = 4096 - 4225*(-1) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nYes, same as before.\n\nSo, that confirms that the product is indeed 8321, and mod 1000 is 321.\n\nBut let me just make sure that I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents or in the initial steps. Because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, especially with high exponents, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, another way to compute (1 + i)^13 is to compute it using De Moivre's theorem.\n\nWe know that 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}, so raising it to the 13th power gives (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13\u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13:\n\nsqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nThen, 13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is the same as \u03c0/4 plus an odd multiple of \u03c0. Since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nCompute this:\n\n64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part is 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i, which matches what I had earlier.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is the conjugate, which is -64 +64i.\n\nSo, yeah, the calculations are consistent.\n\nTherefore, the product is 8321, which mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321 when divided by 1000.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we recognize that \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning \u03c9^13 = 1 and \u03c9^k \u2260 1 for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 12. The given product is:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\n\\]\n\nWe rewrite each term as \\( ( \\omega^{2k} - 2\\omega^k + 2 ) \\) and recognize it as a quadratic in \\( \\omega^k \\). Letting \\( x = \\omega^k \\), each term becomes \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\). Thus, the product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad x = \\omega^k\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\omega^k \\) are all 13th roots of unity, we consider the product over all \\( x \\) such that \\( x^{13} = 1 \\). The quadratic factors as \\( (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)) \\), so the product is:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{x^{13}=1} (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i))\n\\]\n\nThis product can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{(1 + i)^{13} - 1}{(1 + i) - 1} \\right) \\left( \\frac{(1 - i)^{13} - 1}{(1 - i) - 1} \\right)\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n1. \\( (1 + i)^{13} = -64 - 64i \\)\n2. \\( (1 - i)^{13} = -64 + 64i \\)\n3. \\( (1 + i) - 1 = i \\) and \\( (1 - i) - 1 = -i \\)\n\nSubstituting these into the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{(-64 - 64i) - 1}{i} \\right) \\left( \\frac{(-64 + 64i) - 1}{-i} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{-65 - 64i}{i} \\right) \\left( \\frac{-65 + 64i}{-i} \\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each fraction:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{-65 - 64i}{i} = -64 + 65i \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{-65 + 64i}{-i} = -64 - 65i \\)\n\nMultiplying these results:\n\n\\[\n(-64 + 65i)(-64 - 65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321\n\\]\n\nFinally, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is:\n\n\\[\n8321 \\mod 1000 = 321\n\\]\n\nThus, the remainder is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{321}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000.\n\nHmm, 13th roots of unity... I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy \u03c9^n = 1 for some n. Since \u03c9 \u2260 1, it's a primitive 13th root, so \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k for k=1 to 12 are all distinct and different from 1.\n\nThe product is over k from 0 to 12. Wait, when k=0, \u03c9^0 is 1, right? So let me compute the term when k=0. That would be 2 - 2*1 + 1^0 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the first term is 1. The rest of the terms are for k=1 to 12.\n\nSo the product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). So I can ignore the k=0 term because it's 1. So the problem reduces to finding the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) modulo 1000.\n\nHmm, okay. So I need to compute this product. It might help to express the expression inside the product in terms of \u03c9^k.\n\nLet me think: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} can be rewritten as 2(1 - \u03c9^k) + \u03c9^{2k}. Alternatively, perhaps factor it differently.\n\nWait, maybe factor it as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me see:\n\nLet x = \u03c9^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. So that's x^2 - 2x + 2.\n\nIs this quadratic factorable? Let me check the discriminant: D = ( -2 )^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are complex: [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo x^2 - 2x + 2 factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, 2 - 2x + x^2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, substituting back x = \u03c9^k, we have (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nTherefore, the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is equal to the product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich can be written as the product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo that's [product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nHmm, okay. Now, since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 over the rationals is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nBut here, we have products of (\u03c9^k - a) where a is a complex number. I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k=1 to 12 is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + 1.\n\nWait, but here we have (\u03c9^k - a) instead of (x - \u03c9^k). Let me think. If I take the product from k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k), that's \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1). So, product_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6_13(x).\n\nBut in our case, the product is product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a). Let me see if I can relate this to \u03a6_13(x). Let me substitute x = a into \u03a6_13(x). Then \u03a6_13(a) = product_{k=1}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k). So that's (-1)^12 product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a). Because (-1)^12 is 1.\n\nTherefore, product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = \u03a6_13(a).\n\nSo, in our case, for a = (1 + i), the product is \u03a6_13(1 + i), and similarly for a = (1 - i), the product is \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, our original product is \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nSo, now, I need to compute \u03a6_13(x) evaluated at x = 1 + i and x = 1 - i, then multiply those two results together.\n\n\u03a6_13(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is x^12 + x^11 + x^10 + ... + x + 1.\n\nWait, but evaluating this at x = 1 + i is going to be a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the magnitude squared of \u03a6_13(1 + i). Because if I have a complex number z = a + bi, then z * conjugate(z) = |z|^2. So, since \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i) are conjugates if \u03a6_13 has real coefficients, which it does because it's a cyclotomic polynomial.\n\nTherefore, \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) = |\u03a6_13(1 + i)|^2. So, if I can compute \u03a6_13(1 + i), take its magnitude squared, that would give me the product.\n\nSo, let me compute \u03a6_13(1 + i). Since \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) when x \u2260 1.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / (i).\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^13 first.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^{13}: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}: Let's compute the angle. 13 * \u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13/4 is 3 + 1/4. So, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i).\n\nCompute this: sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) is 2. So, 64 * (-2)/2 * (1 + i) = 64 * (-1) * (1 + i) = -64(1 + i).\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i).\n\nNow, plug this into \u03a6_13(1 + i):\n\n\u03a6_13(1 + i) = ( -64(1 + i) - 1 ) / (i ) = ( -64(1 + i) - 1 ) / i.\n\nSimplify numerator: -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = ( -65 -64i ) / i.\n\nDivide by i: multiply numerator and denominator by -i (since 1/i = -i).\n\nSo, ( -65 -64i ) * (-i) / (i * -i) = ( (-65)(-i) + (-64i)(-i) ) / (1) because i*(-i)=1.\n\nCompute numerator: 65i + 64i^2. Since i^2 = -1, this becomes 65i -64.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = (-64 + 65i).\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) would be the conjugate, which is (-64 -65i).\n\nTherefore, the product \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) is (-64 + 65i)(-64 -65i). This is the magnitude squared.\n\nCompute this product: (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225)(i^2). Since i^2 = -1, this becomes 4096 - (4225)(-1) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply (-64 + 65i)(-64 -65i):\n\n= (-64)(-64) + (-64)(-65i) + (65i)(-64) + (65i)(-65i)\n\n= 4096 + 4160i - 4160i - 4225i^2\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe 4160i and -4160i cancel each other.\n\nLeft with 4096 - 4225i^2.\n\nBut i^2 = -1, so:\n\n4096 - 4225*(-1) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The original product is from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) which we converted into \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) = 8321.\n\nBut wait, 8321 is the value of the product from k=1 to 12, and the overall product is 1 * 8321 = 8321.\n\nSo, the value of the product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Find the remainder when [...] is divided by 1000.\" So, 8321 divided by 1000 leaves a remainder of 321.\n\nBut hold on, is 8321 correct?\n\nLet me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers and cyclotomic polynomials, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFirst, let's re-examine \u03a6_13(1 + i):\n\nWe had \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1). So, substituting x = 1 + i:\n\n( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / (i )\n\nWe computed (1 + i)^13 as -64(1 + i). Let me confirm that:\n\n(1 + i)^2 = 2i.\n\n(1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4.\n\n(1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.\n\n(1 + i)^12 = ( (1 + i)^8 ) * ( (1 + i)^4 ) = 16 * (-4) = -64.\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^12 * (1 + i) = (-64)(1 + i). Correct.\n\nSo numerator is (-64)(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nDivide by i: multiply numerator and denominator by -i:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-i) / (i * -i) = (65i + 64i^2)/1 = 65i -64.\n\nSo \u03a6_13(1 + i) = (-64 + 65i). Correct.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = (-64 -65i). Correct.\n\nMultiplying them: (-64 + 65i)(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225)(-1) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321. Correct.\n\nSo the product is 8321. Therefore, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321, since 8321 = 8*1000 + 321.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321. Yep.\n\nBut wait, is the product from k=0 to 12 equal to 8321? Let me think again.\n\nBecause when k=0, the term is 1, so the total product is 1 * product from k=1 to 12, which is 8321. So, yes, 8321 is correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: sometimes cyclotomic polynomials have symmetries or other properties that might let us compute \u03a6_n(a) more easily, especially when a is a Gaussian integer.\n\nBut perhaps 8321 is correct, so 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So the answer is 321.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in evaluating \u03a6_13(1 + i).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) another way.\n\n\u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. So, \u03a6_13(1 + i) is the sum from k=0 to 12 of (1 + i)^k, minus 1, since \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nWait, but that's the same as we did before. So, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / (1 + i - 1 ) = [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] / i. Which is what we did.\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) numerically.\n\nCompute (1 + i)^13: as above, it's -64(1 + i). So, [ -64(1 + i) -1 ] / i = [ -64 -64i -1 ] / i = (-65 -64i)/i.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by -i: (-65 -64i)(-i) / (i * -i) = (65i +64i^2)/1 = 65i -64.\n\nSo, yes, \u03a6_13(1 + i) is -64 +65i, which has magnitude sqrt( (-64)^2 + 65^2 ) = sqrt(4096 + 4225) = sqrt(8321). But we squared it, so 8321.\n\nSo, yes, the product is 8321.\n\nThus, the remainder when divided by 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think again about the product.\n\nThe product is over (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) for k=0 to 12. We saw that when k=0, it's 1. So the product is 1 * product_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = 8321.\n\nSo, 8321 mod 1000 is 321. So, the answer is 321.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute 8321 mod 1000:\n\n1000 * 8 = 8000, 8321 - 8000 = 321. Yep.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 321.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000.\n\nHmm, 13th roots of unity... I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy \u03c9^n = 1 for some n. Since \u03c9 \u2260 1, it's a primitive 13th root, so \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k for k=1 to 12 are all distinct and different from 1.\n\nThe product is over k from 0 to 12. Wait, when k=0, \u03c9^0 is 1, right? So let me compute the term when k=0. That would be 2 - 2*1 + 1^0 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the first term is 1. The rest of the terms are for k=1 to 12.\n\nSo the product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). So I can ignore the k=0 term because it's 1. So the problem reduces to finding the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) modulo 1000.\n\nHmm, okay. So I need to compute this product. It might help to express the expression inside the product in terms of \u03c9^k.\n\nLet me think: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} can be rewritten as 2(1 - \u03c9^k) + \u03c9^{2k}. Alternatively, perhaps factor it differently.\n\nWait, maybe factor it as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me see:\n\nLet x = \u03c9^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. So that's x^2 - 2x + 2.\n\nIs this quadratic factorable? Let me check the discriminant: D = ( -2 )^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are complex: [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo x^2 - 2x + 2 factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, 2 - 2x + x^2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, substituting back x = \u03c9^k, we have (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nTherefore, the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is equal to the product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich can be written as the product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo that's [product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nHmm, okay. Now, since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 over the rationals is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.\n\nBut here, we have products of (\u03c9^k - a) where a is a complex number. I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k=1 to 12 is \u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + 1.\n\nWait, but here we have (\u03c9^k - a) instead of (x - \u03c9^k). Let me think. If I take the product from k=1 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k), that's \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1). So, product_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6_13(x).\n\nBut in our case, the product is product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a). Let me see if I can relate this to \u03a6_13(x). Let me substitute x = a into \u03a6_13(x). Then \u03a6_13(a) = product_{k=1}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k). So that's (-1)^12 product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a). Because (-1)^12 is 1.\n\nTherefore, product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = \u03a6_13(a).\n\nSo, in our case, for a = (1 + i), the product is \u03a6_13(1 + i), and similarly for a = (1 - i), the product is \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, our original product is \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i).\n\nSo, now, I need to compute \u03a6_13(x) evaluated at x = 1 + i and x = 1 - i, then multiply those two results together.\n\n\u03a6_13(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is x^12 + x^11 + x^10 + ... + x + 1.\n\nWait, but evaluating this at x = 1 + i is going to be a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the magnitude squared of \u03a6_13(1 + i). Because if I have a complex number z = a + bi, then z * conjugate(z) = |z|^2. So, since \u03a6_13(1 + i) and \u03a6_13(1 - i) are conjugates if \u03a6_13 has real coefficients, which it does because it's a cyclotomic polynomial.\n\nTherefore, \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) = |\u03a6_13(1 + i)|^2. So, if I can compute \u03a6_13(1 + i), take its magnitude squared, that would give me the product.\n\nSo, let me compute \u03a6_13(1 + i). Since \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) when x \u2260 1.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / (i).\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^13 first.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^{13}: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}: Let's compute the angle. 13 * \u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13/4 is 3 + 1/4. So, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i).\n\nCompute this: sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) is 2. So, 64 * (-2)/2 * (1 + i) = 64 * (-1) * (1 + i) = -64(1 + i).\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i).\n\nNow, plug this into \u03a6_13(1 + i):\n\n\u03a6_13(1 + i) = ( -64(1 + i) - 1 ) / (i ) = ( -64(1 + i) - 1 ) / i.\n\nSimplify numerator: -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = ( -65 -64i ) / i.\n\nDivide by i: multiply numerator and denominator by -i (since 1/i = -i).\n\nSo, ( -65 -64i ) * (-i) / (i * -i) = ( (-65)(-i) + (-64i)(-i) ) / (1) because i*(-i)=1.\n\nCompute numerator: 65i + 64i^2. Since i^2 = -1, this becomes 65i -64.\n\nSo, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = (-64 + 65i).\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) would be the conjugate, which is (-64 -65i).\n\nTherefore, the product \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) is (-64 + 65i)(-64 -65i). This is the magnitude squared.\n\nCompute this product: (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225)(i^2). Since i^2 = -1, this becomes 4096 - (4225)(-1) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply (-64 + 65i)(-64 -65i):\n\n= (-64)(-64) + (-64)(-65i) + (65i)(-64) + (65i)(-65i)\n\n= 4096 + 4160i - 4160i - 4225i^2\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe 4160i and -4160i cancel each other.\n\nLeft with 4096 - 4225i^2.\n\nBut i^2 = -1, so:\n\n4096 - 4225*(-1) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The original product is from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) which we converted into \u03a6_13(1 + i) * \u03a6_13(1 - i) = 8321.\n\nBut wait, 8321 is the value of the product from k=1 to 12, and the overall product is 1 * 8321 = 8321.\n\nSo, the value of the product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Find the remainder when [...] is divided by 1000.\" So, 8321 divided by 1000 leaves a remainder of 321.\n\nBut hold on, is 8321 correct?\n\nLet me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers and cyclotomic polynomials, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFirst, let's re-examine \u03a6_13(1 + i):\n\nWe had \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1). So, substituting x = 1 + i:\n\n( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / (i )\n\nWe computed (1 + i)^13 as -64(1 + i). Let me confirm that:\n\n(1 + i)^2 = 2i.\n\n(1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4.\n\n(1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.\n\n(1 + i)^12 = ( (1 + i)^8 ) * ( (1 + i)^4 ) = 16 * (-4) = -64.\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^12 * (1 + i) = (-64)(1 + i). Correct.\n\nSo numerator is (-64)(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nDivide by i: multiply numerator and denominator by -i:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-i) / (i * -i) = (65i + 64i^2)/1 = 65i -64.\n\nSo \u03a6_13(1 + i) = (-64 + 65i). Correct.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6_13(1 - i) = (-64 -65i). Correct.\n\nMultiplying them: (-64 + 65i)(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225)(-1) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321. Correct.\n\nSo the product is 8321. Therefore, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321, since 8321 = 8*1000 + 321.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321. Yep.\n\nBut wait, is the product from k=0 to 12 equal to 8321? Let me think again.\n\nBecause when k=0, the term is 1, so the total product is 1 * product from k=1 to 12, which is 8321. So, yes, 8321 is correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: sometimes cyclotomic polynomials have symmetries or other properties that might let us compute \u03a6_n(a) more easily, especially when a is a Gaussian integer.\n\nBut perhaps 8321 is correct, so 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So the answer is 321.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in evaluating \u03a6_13(1 + i).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) another way.\n\n\u03a6_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. So, \u03a6_13(1 + i) is the sum from k=0 to 12 of (1 + i)^k, minus 1, since \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\nWait, but that's the same as we did before. So, \u03a6_13(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / (1 + i - 1 ) = [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] / i. Which is what we did.\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute \u03a6_13(1 + i) numerically.\n\nCompute (1 + i)^13: as above, it's -64(1 + i). So, [ -64(1 + i) -1 ] / i = [ -64 -64i -1 ] / i = (-65 -64i)/i.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by -i: (-65 -64i)(-i) / (i * -i) = (65i +64i^2)/1 = 65i -64.\n\nSo, yes, \u03a6_13(1 + i) is -64 +65i, which has magnitude sqrt( (-64)^2 + 65^2 ) = sqrt(4096 + 4225) = sqrt(8321). But we squared it, so 8321.\n\nSo, yes, the product is 8321.\n\nThus, the remainder when divided by 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think again about the product.\n\nThe product is over (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) for k=0 to 12. We saw that when k=0, it's 1. So the product is 1 * product_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = 8321.\n\nSo, 8321 mod 1000 is 321. So, the answer is 321.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute 8321 mod 1000:\n\n1000 * 8 = 8000, 8321 - 8000 = 321. Yep.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 321.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) is a 13th root of unity.\n\n1. **Identify the term for \\(k=0\\):**\n   - When \\(k=0\\), \\(\\omega^0 = 1\\), so the term is \\(2 - 2(1) + 1 = 1\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the product for \\(k=1\\) to \\(12\\):**\n   - For \\(k \\geq 1\\), express each term as \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\).\n   - Let \\(x = \\omega^k\\), then each term becomes \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\), which factors as \\((x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i))\\).\n\n3. **Express the product using cyclotomic polynomials:**\n   - The product becomes \\(\\prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) = \\prod_{k=1}^{12} ( \\omega^k - (1 + i) ) \\cdot \\prod_{k=1}^{12} ( \\omega^k - (1 - i) )\\).\n   - Using properties of cyclotomic polynomials, this is equivalent to \\(\\Phi_{13}(1 + i) \\cdot \\Phi_{13}(1 - i)\\), where \\(\\Phi_{13}(x)\\) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial.\n\n4. **Evaluate \\(\\Phi_{13}(1 + i)\\) and \\(\\Phi_{13}(1 - i)\\):**\n   - \\(\\Phi_{13}(x) = \\frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1}\\).\n   - Compute \\((1 + i)^{13} = -64(1 + i)\\), leading to \\(\\Phi_{13}(1 + i) = -64 + 65i\\) and \\(\\Phi_{13}(1 - i) = -64 - 65i\\).\n\n5. **Compute the product of the two evaluations:**\n   - The product is \\((-64 + 65i)(-64 - 65i) = 8321\\).\n\n6. **Find the remainder modulo 1000:**\n   - \\(8321 \\mod 1000 = 321\\).\n\nThus, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is \\(\\boxed{321}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity not equal to 1.\n\nHmm, let's see. First, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy \u03c9^n = 1 for some integer n. In this case, n is 13, so \u03c9^13 = 1. Also, \u03c9 \u2260 1, so we're dealing with the primitive 13th roots of unity.\n\nThe product is over k from 0 to 12, so that's all the 13th roots of unity. Each term in the product is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify each term or find a pattern.\n\nLet me write out the general term: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Hmm, perhaps I can factor this or relate it to something I know.\n\nWait, let's see: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} can be rewritten as \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. That looks a bit like a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me check: if I let x = \u03c9^k, then the term becomes x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nSo each term is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, where x is \u03c9^k. So the product is the product over all x (where x is a 13th root of unity except x=1) of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). Wait, but actually, k goes from 0 to 12, so x would include \u03c9^0 = 1 as well. So the product includes k=0, which would be x=1. Let me compute that term: when k=0, x=1, so the term is 1\u00b2 - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So that term is 1, so the product is the same as the product from k=1 to 12 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) where x = \u03c9^k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the product over all x where x^13 = 1 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). Because when k=0, x=1, and the term is 1, but in the product from k=0 to 12, we include x=1. Wait, but in the problem statement, \u03c9 \u2260 1, but the product is from k=0 to 12, so does that mean that \u03c9^k includes 1 when k=0? Hmm, maybe I should double-check that.\n\nWait, the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, but it's a 13th root of unity, so \u03c9^0 = 1, which is a 13th root of unity, but \u03c9 itself is not 1. So when k=0, \u03c9^0 is 1, but \u03c9^k for k from 1 to 12 are the primitive 13th roots. So the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including 1, so when k=0, the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1\u00b2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1, as I thought earlier. So the product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the product over all 13th roots of unity, including x=1. So let's think of the product as the product over all x such that x^13 = 1 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2).\n\nI know that for polynomials, the product over roots can be related to the value of the polynomial at certain points. So maybe I can consider a polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity, which is x^13 - 1 = 0. But we're evaluating a product of terms at each root, so perhaps using some properties of polynomials.\n\nWait, more precisely, the product over x^13 = 1 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) would be equal to the resultant of evaluating the polynomial P(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 at each root of x^13 - 1. So the product is the product of P(x) as x ranges over all 13th roots of unity.\n\nBut how do I compute that? I remember that for a polynomial Q(x), the product of Q(x) over all roots x of another polynomial R(x) can sometimes be found using resultants or by evaluating the resultant of Q and R.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the product over x of (x - a) is equal to the minimal polynomial evaluated at a. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: consider that the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2), where x^13 = 1. So, perhaps I can write this as the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) = product over x of (x^2 - 2x + 2).\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of this as evaluating the resultant of x^13 - 1 and x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the product over all x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the value of the polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1 evaluated at the roots of x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0, but that might not be directly applicable.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to note that if we have a polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1, then the product over all its roots x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and the polynomial P(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. But I'm not sure about the exact formula for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the product by considering that the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over x of (x - \u03b1)(x - \u03b2), where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the roots of x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0.\n\nSo let me find the roots of x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, x = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So the roots are \u03b1 = 1 + i and \u03b2 = 1 - i.\n\nSo the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is the product over x of (x - \u03b1)(x - \u03b2) = product over x of (x - \u03b1) * product over x of (x - \u03b2).\n\nBut the product over x of (x - \u03b1) is the value of the polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1 evaluated at x = \u03b1. Because f(x) = product over x of (x - x_j), where x_j are the roots, which are the 13th roots of unity. So product over x of (x - \u03b1) = f(\u03b1) = \u03b1^13 - 1.\n\nSimilarly, product over x of (x - \u03b2) = \u03b2^13 - 1.\n\nTherefore, the product we're looking for is (\u03b1^13 - 1)(\u03b2^13 - 1).\n\nSo I can compute \u03b1^13 and \u03b2^13.\n\nFirst, compute \u03b1^13. Since \u03b1 = 1 + i, let's compute its modulus and argument to use De Moivre's theorem.\n\nThe modulus of \u03b1 is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is arctan(1/1) = \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nTherefore, \u03b1 = sqrt(2) * (cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)).\n\nSo \u03b1^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * [cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4)].\n\nSimilarly, \u03b2 = 1 - i, which has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo \u03b2^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * [cos(-13\u03c0/4) + i sin(-13\u03c0/4)].\n\nCompute [sqrt(2)]^13: sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so [2^(1/2)]^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, compute cos(13\u03c0/4) and sin(13\u03c0/4). 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = (12\u03c0 + \u03c0)/4 = 13\u03c0/4. But wait, 3\u03c0 is 540 degrees, plus 45 degrees is 585 degrees, which is equivalent to 585 - 360 = 225 degrees. So cos(225\u00b0) = -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(225\u00b0) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, for \u03b2^13: cos(-13\u03c0/4) is the same as cos(13\u03c0/4) because cosine is even, and sin(-13\u03c0/4) is -sin(13\u03c0/4). But let's compute it:\n\n13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, so cos(13\u03c0/4) = cos(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = -cos(\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, sin(13\u03c0/4) = sin(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = -sin(\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, \u03b1^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i).\n\nSimplify this:\n\nsqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2, so 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2) * (-1/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the (1 + i) factor remains, so \u03b1^13 = -64(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, \u03b2^13: since \u03b2 = 1 - i, its argument is -\u03c0/4, so when raised to 13th power, it's [sqrt(2)]^13 [cos(-13\u03c0/4) + i sin(-13\u03c0/4)].\n\ncos(-13\u03c0/4) = cos(13\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nsin(-13\u03c0/4) = -sin(13\u03c0/4) = -(-sqrt(2)/2) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's compute it correctly.\n\nWait, 13\u03c0/4 is the same as 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, so cos(13\u03c0/4) = cos(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = -cos(\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nsin(13\u03c0/4) = sin(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = -sin(\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo cos(-13\u03c0/4) = cos(13\u03c0/4) because cosine is even, so it's -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nsin(-13\u03c0/4) = -sin(13\u03c0/4) = -(-sqrt(2)/2) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, \u03b2^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i (sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) ].\n\nAgain, sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, so 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSo \u03b2^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\nSo now, the product we're looking for is (\u03b1^13 - 1)(\u03b2^13 - 1) = (-64(1 + i) - 1)(-64(1 - i) - 1).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSecond term: -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to the square of the modulus: |(-65 -64i)|^2.\n\nCompute the modulus squared: (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but let me verify that calculation:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the product over all x (13th roots of unity) of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is 8321.\n\nBut wait, the original product in the problem is from k=0 to 12, which includes x=1. So in this calculation, we included x=1, so the product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that when k=0, the term is 1, so the product from k=0 to 12 is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12, which would be the same as the product over all x except x=1, but in this case, I considered the product over all x, including x=1, and it's 8321. Wait, but when I included x=1, the term was 1, so the product remains 8321.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, \u03c9 \u2260 1, but in the product, when k=0, we have \u03c9^0 =1, so the term is 1. So the product is indeed 8321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: when I computed the product as the product over all x of (x\u00b2 -2x +2), which includes x=1, and that product is 8321. So the answer is 8321.\n\nBut the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321.\n\nSo the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, when I computed \u03b1^13 and \u03b2^13, I got -64(1 + i) and -64(1 - i), respectively. Then, subtracting 1 from each:\n\n\u03b1^13 -1 = -64(1 +i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\n\u03b2^13 -1 = -64(1 -i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nThen the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all 13 roots correctly. Since the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including x=1, which contributed a factor of 1, so the product is indeed 8321.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but another way to compute this product is to consider the product over all x of (x^2 - 2x +2) where x^13=1. Alternatively, perhaps using cyclotomic polynomials, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think again: perhaps I can consider that the product over all x of (x^2 - 2x +2) is equal to the resultant of x^13 -1 and x^2 -2x +2. But I'm not sure about that approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that the product over x of (x^2 -2x +2) is the same as the product over x of (x - \u03b1)(x - \u03b2) where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are 1 \u00b1 i, as we found earlier. Then, as I did before, the product is (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1) = 8321.\n\nSo I think my approach is correct, so the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check whether \u03b1^13 is indeed -64(1 +i). Let me compute \u03b1^13 again.\n\n\u03b1 = 1 + i, which is sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo \u03b1^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13\u03c0/4}.\n\n(sqrt(2))^13 is 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\ne^{i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1) = (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) * (-1) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo \u03b1^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nCompute this: sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2, so 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64 as well, but since it's multiplied by i, it's -64i.\n\nWait, no, wait: let me compute it correctly.\n\nWait, \u03b1^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + (-i sqrt(2)/2) ]\n\nSo, the real part is 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nThe imaginary part is 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) * i = 64 * (-2)/2 * i = -64i.\n\nSo \u03b1^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03b2^13 would be -64 +64i.\n\nSo, then \u03b1^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\n\u03b2^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.\n\nSo I think I'm confident that the answer is 321.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity not equal to 1.\n\nHmm, let's see. First, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy \u03c9^n = 1 for some integer n. In this case, n is 13, so \u03c9^13 = 1. Also, \u03c9 \u2260 1, so we're dealing with the primitive 13th roots of unity.\n\nThe product is over k from 0 to 12, so that's all the 13th roots of unity. Each term in the product is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify each term or find a pattern.\n\nLet me write out the general term: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Hmm, perhaps I can factor this or relate it to something I know.\n\nWait, let's see: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} can be rewritten as \u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2. That looks a bit like a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me check: if I let x = \u03c9^k, then the term becomes x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nSo each term is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, where x is \u03c9^k. So the product is the product over all x (where x is a 13th root of unity except x=1) of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). Wait, but actually, k goes from 0 to 12, so x would include \u03c9^0 = 1 as well. So the product includes k=0, which would be x=1. Let me compute that term: when k=0, x=1, so the term is 1\u00b2 - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So that term is 1, so the product is the same as the product from k=1 to 12 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) where x = \u03c9^k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the product over all x where x^13 = 1 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). Because when k=0, x=1, and the term is 1, but in the product from k=0 to 12, we include x=1. Wait, but in the problem statement, \u03c9 \u2260 1, but the product is from k=0 to 12, so does that mean that \u03c9^k includes 1 when k=0? Hmm, maybe I should double-check that.\n\nWait, the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, but it's a 13th root of unity, so \u03c9^0 = 1, which is a 13th root of unity, but \u03c9 itself is not 1. So when k=0, \u03c9^0 is 1, but \u03c9^k for k from 1 to 12 are the primitive 13th roots. So the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including 1, so when k=0, the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1\u00b2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1, as I thought earlier. So the product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the product over all 13th roots of unity, including x=1. So let's think of the product as the product over all x such that x^13 = 1 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2).\n\nI know that for polynomials, the product over roots can be related to the value of the polynomial at certain points. So maybe I can consider a polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity, which is x^13 - 1 = 0. But we're evaluating a product of terms at each root, so perhaps using some properties of polynomials.\n\nWait, more precisely, the product over x^13 = 1 of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) would be equal to the resultant of evaluating the polynomial P(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 at each root of x^13 - 1. So the product is the product of P(x) as x ranges over all 13th roots of unity.\n\nBut how do I compute that? I remember that for a polynomial Q(x), the product of Q(x) over all roots x of another polynomial R(x) can sometimes be found using resultants or by evaluating the resultant of Q and R.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the product over x of (x - a) is equal to the minimal polynomial evaluated at a. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: consider that the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2), where x^13 = 1. So, perhaps I can write this as the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) = product over x of (x^2 - 2x + 2).\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of this as evaluating the resultant of x^13 - 1 and x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the product over all x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the value of the polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1 evaluated at the roots of x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0, but that might not be directly applicable.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to note that if we have a polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1, then the product over all its roots x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and the polynomial P(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. But I'm not sure about the exact formula for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the product by considering that the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is equal to the product over x of (x - \u03b1)(x - \u03b2), where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the roots of x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0.\n\nSo let me find the roots of x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, x = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So the roots are \u03b1 = 1 + i and \u03b2 = 1 - i.\n\nSo the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is the product over x of (x - \u03b1)(x - \u03b2) = product over x of (x - \u03b1) * product over x of (x - \u03b2).\n\nBut the product over x of (x - \u03b1) is the value of the polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1 evaluated at x = \u03b1. Because f(x) = product over x of (x - x_j), where x_j are the roots, which are the 13th roots of unity. So product over x of (x - \u03b1) = f(\u03b1) = \u03b1^13 - 1.\n\nSimilarly, product over x of (x - \u03b2) = \u03b2^13 - 1.\n\nTherefore, the product we're looking for is (\u03b1^13 - 1)(\u03b2^13 - 1).\n\nSo I can compute \u03b1^13 and \u03b2^13.\n\nFirst, compute \u03b1^13. Since \u03b1 = 1 + i, let's compute its modulus and argument to use De Moivre's theorem.\n\nThe modulus of \u03b1 is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is arctan(1/1) = \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nTherefore, \u03b1 = sqrt(2) * (cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)).\n\nSo \u03b1^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * [cos(13\u03c0/4) + i sin(13\u03c0/4)].\n\nSimilarly, \u03b2 = 1 - i, which has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo \u03b2^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * [cos(-13\u03c0/4) + i sin(-13\u03c0/4)].\n\nCompute [sqrt(2)]^13: sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so [2^(1/2)]^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, compute cos(13\u03c0/4) and sin(13\u03c0/4). 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, since 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = (12\u03c0 + \u03c0)/4 = 13\u03c0/4. But wait, 3\u03c0 is 540 degrees, plus 45 degrees is 585 degrees, which is equivalent to 585 - 360 = 225 degrees. So cos(225\u00b0) = -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(225\u00b0) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, for \u03b2^13: cos(-13\u03c0/4) is the same as cos(13\u03c0/4) because cosine is even, and sin(-13\u03c0/4) is -sin(13\u03c0/4). But let's compute it:\n\n13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, so cos(13\u03c0/4) = cos(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = -cos(\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, sin(13\u03c0/4) = sin(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = -sin(\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, \u03b1^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ] = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i).\n\nSimplify this:\n\nsqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2, so 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2) * (-1/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the (1 + i) factor remains, so \u03b1^13 = -64(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, \u03b2^13: since \u03b2 = 1 - i, its argument is -\u03c0/4, so when raised to 13th power, it's [sqrt(2)]^13 [cos(-13\u03c0/4) + i sin(-13\u03c0/4)].\n\ncos(-13\u03c0/4) = cos(13\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nsin(-13\u03c0/4) = -sin(13\u03c0/4) = -(-sqrt(2)/2) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's compute it correctly.\n\nWait, 13\u03c0/4 is the same as 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, so cos(13\u03c0/4) = cos(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = -cos(\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nsin(13\u03c0/4) = sin(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4) = -sin(\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo cos(-13\u03c0/4) = cos(13\u03c0/4) because cosine is even, so it's -sqrt(2)/2.\n\nsin(-13\u03c0/4) = -sin(13\u03c0/4) = -(-sqrt(2)/2) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, \u03b2^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i (sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) ].\n\nAgain, sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, so 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSo \u03b2^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\nSo now, the product we're looking for is (\u03b1^13 - 1)(\u03b2^13 - 1) = (-64(1 + i) - 1)(-64(1 - i) - 1).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSecond term: -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to the square of the modulus: |(-65 -64i)|^2.\n\nCompute the modulus squared: (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but let me verify that calculation:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the product over all x (13th roots of unity) of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is 8321.\n\nBut wait, the original product in the problem is from k=0 to 12, which includes x=1. So in this calculation, we included x=1, so the product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that when k=0, the term is 1, so the product from k=0 to 12 is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12, which would be the same as the product over all x except x=1, but in this case, I considered the product over all x, including x=1, and it's 8321. Wait, but when I included x=1, the term was 1, so the product remains 8321.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, \u03c9 \u2260 1, but in the product, when k=0, we have \u03c9^0 =1, so the term is 1. So the product is indeed 8321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: when I computed the product as the product over all x of (x\u00b2 -2x +2), which includes x=1, and that product is 8321. So the answer is 8321.\n\nBut the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321.\n\nSo the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, when I computed \u03b1^13 and \u03b2^13, I got -64(1 + i) and -64(1 - i), respectively. Then, subtracting 1 from each:\n\n\u03b1^13 -1 = -64(1 +i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\n\u03b2^13 -1 = -64(1 -i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nThen the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all 13 roots correctly. Since the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including x=1, which contributed a factor of 1, so the product is indeed 8321.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but another way to compute this product is to consider the product over all x of (x^2 - 2x +2) where x^13=1. Alternatively, perhaps using cyclotomic polynomials, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think again: perhaps I can consider that the product over all x of (x^2 - 2x +2) is equal to the resultant of x^13 -1 and x^2 -2x +2. But I'm not sure about that approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that the product over x of (x^2 -2x +2) is the same as the product over x of (x - \u03b1)(x - \u03b2) where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are 1 \u00b1 i, as we found earlier. Then, as I did before, the product is (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1) = 8321.\n\nSo I think my approach is correct, so the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check whether \u03b1^13 is indeed -64(1 +i). Let me compute \u03b1^13 again.\n\n\u03b1 = 1 + i, which is sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo \u03b1^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13\u03c0/4}.\n\n(sqrt(2))^13 is 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\ne^{i13\u03c0/4} = e^{i(3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * e^{i3\u03c0} = e^{i\u03c0/4} * (-1) = (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) * (-1) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo \u03b1^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nCompute this: sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2, so 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64 as well, but since it's multiplied by i, it's -64i.\n\nWait, no, wait: let me compute it correctly.\n\nWait, \u03b1^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + (-i sqrt(2)/2) ]\n\nSo, the real part is 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nThe imaginary part is 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) * i = 64 * (-2)/2 * i = -64i.\n\nSo \u03b1^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, \u03b2^13 would be -64 +64i.\n\nSo, then \u03b1^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\n\u03b2^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.\n\nSo I think I'm confident that the answer is 321.\n\n\nThe problem requires finding the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive 13th root of unity.\n\nFirst, note that each term in the product can be rewritten as \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\) where \\(x = \\omega^k\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let \u03c9 not equal to 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating, but let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy the equation \u03c9^n = 1 for some integer n. In this case, n is 13, so \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity because \u03c9 \u2260 1. That means \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k for k=1 to 12 are all the other roots.\n\nThe problem is asking about the product of terms of the form (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) for k from 0 to 12. So, I need to compute this product and then find its remainder modulo 1000.\n\nLet me write out the product:\n\nP = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\n\nI wonder if there's a way to simplify each term before multiplying them all together. Maybe I can factor each term or express it in a different form.\n\nLooking at each factor: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let's see if this can be rewritten. Maybe factor out a 2 from the first two terms:\n\n2(1 - \u03c9^k) + \u03c9^{2k}\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe treat it as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me let x = \u03c9^k for a moment.\n\nThen each term becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. Let me rearrange that: x^2 - 2x + 2.\n\nWait, that's a quadratic. Maybe I can factor it or find its roots. Let's compute the discriminant: D = (\u22122)^2 \u2212 4*1*2 = 4 \u2212 8 = -4. So, the roots are complex: [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo, x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Therefore, each term factors as (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nTherefore, the product becomes:\n\nP = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nP = [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))]\n\nSo, now I have two separate products. Let me focus on one of them, say Q = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a), where a is either (1 + i) or (1 - i).\n\nI recall that for roots of unity, the product over all \u03c9^k - a can be related to the cyclotomic polynomial or perhaps the minimal polynomial. Wait, the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k from 0 to 12 is x^13 - 1, because the roots are exactly the 13th roots of unity.\n\nSo, if I set x = a, then the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1.\n\nBut wait, in our case, it's \u220f (\u03c9^k - a) which is (-1)^13 times \u220f (a - \u03c9^k) because we can factor out a negative sign from each term. Since 13 is odd, (-1)^13 = -1.\n\nSo, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a^13 - 1) = 1 - a^13.\n\nTherefore, each of our Q terms is 1 - a^13, where a is (1 + i) or (1 - i).\n\nSo, for a = 1 + i, Q1 = 1 - (1 + i)^13.\n\nSimilarly, for a = 1 - i, Q2 = 1 - (1 - i)^13.\n\nTherefore, the entire product P = Q1 * Q2 = [1 - (1 + i)^13][1 - (1 - i)^13].\n\nHmm, so now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI remember that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. Let me compute that.\n\nThe modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is \u03c0/4 radians because it's in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has the same modulus, sqrt(2), but the argument is -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute [sqrt(2)]^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute 13\u03c0/4. Since 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to \u03c0/4 when considering angles modulo 2\u03c0. Because 3\u03c0 is \u03c0 + 2\u03c0, so subtracting 2\u03c0 gives \u03c0/4.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Let me compute 13 divided by 4: 3*4=12, so 13/4 = 3 + 1/4. So, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so let's subtract 2\u03c0 to get an equivalent angle between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\n3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me think again. 13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is 3*180=540 degrees, which is 180 + 360 degrees, so subtracting 2\u03c0 (360 degrees) gives 180 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 13\u03c0/4 is 13 * 45 = 585 degrees. 585 - 360 = 225 degrees, which is 5\u03c0/4. So, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 5\u03c0/4 in standard position.\n\nSimilarly, -13\u03c0/4 is the same as -5\u03c0/4. But since angles are periodic with 2\u03c0, adding 2\u03c0 to -5\u03c0/4 gives 3\u03c0/4.\n\nWait, let me verify: -13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4 = (-13 + 8)\u03c0/4 = (-5\u03c0)/4. Hmm, that's not positive. Let me add 2\u03c0 again: (-5\u03c0/4) + 8\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 3\u03c0/4} because adding 2\u03c0 brings it to the equivalent angle.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: e^{-i\u03b8} is the conjugate of e^{i\u03b8}, so e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} is the conjugate of e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}, which is e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the exponentials directly.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * (2\u03c0 - 13\u03c0/4)}.\n\nWait, 2\u03c0 is 8\u03c0/4, so 8\u03c0/4 - 13\u03c0/4 = -5\u03c0/4. But adding 2\u03c0 to -5\u03c0/4 gives 3\u03c0/4. So, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 3\u03c0/4}.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Alternatively, since e^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8, and e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) - i(\u221a2/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = cos(13\u03c0/4) - i sin(13\u03c0/4) = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) - i(-\u221a2/2) = (-\u221a2/2) + i(\u221a2/2).\n\nWait, but 13\u03c0/4 is 5\u03c0/4 when reduced modulo 2\u03c0, so e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) - i(-\u221a2/2) = (-\u221a2/2) + i(\u221a2/2).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-\u221a2/2) - i(\u221a2/2) ]\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-\u221a2/2) + i(\u221a2/2) ]\n\nLet me compute these expressions.\n\nFirst, compute 64 * sqrt(2) multiplied by (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2).\n\nMultiply 64 * sqrt(2) by (-\u221a2/2):\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * (- (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part is 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i\u221a2/2) = 64 * (-i * (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64*(-i*2/2) = 64*(-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, for (1 - i)^13:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2) = same as above, except the imaginary part is positive.\n\nSo, real part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = -64.\n\nImaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (i\u221a2/2) = 64 * i*(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 = 64*i*(2)/2 = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nNow, going back to Q1 and Q2.\n\nQ1 = 1 - (1 + i)^13 = 1 - (-64 - 64i) = 1 + 64 + 64i = 65 + 64i.\n\nSimilarly, Q2 = 1 - (1 - i)^13 = 1 - (-64 + 64i) = 1 + 64 - 64i = 65 - 64i.\n\nTherefore, P = Q1 * Q2 = (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i).\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to (65)^2 + (64)^2.\n\nCompute 65^2: 65*65. Let me compute that: 60^2=3600, 5^2=25, and 2*60*5=600. So, (60+5)^2=60^2 + 2*60*5 +5^2= 3600 +600 +25=4225.\n\nSimilarly, 64^2 is 4096. Because 60^2=3600, 4^2=16, and 2*60*4=480, so (60+4)^2=3600+480+16=4096.\n\nSo, P = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, 4225 + 4096: 4000 + 4000 = 8000, 225 + 96=321, so total is 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nBut the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, compute 8321 mod 1000.\n\nDividing 8321 by 1000: 1000*8=8000, so 8321 - 8000 = 321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check all the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, when I factored each term as (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)), that seems correct because the quadratic x^2 - 2x +2 factors into (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)).\n\nThen, the product over all \u03c9^k of (\u03c9^k - a) is 1 - a^13, because the product of (x - \u03c9^k) is x^13 -1, so replacing x with a gives a^13 -1, but since we have (\u03c9^k - a), it's - (a - \u03c9^k), so the product becomes (-1)^13 (a^13 -1) = -(a^13 -1) = 1 - a^13. That makes sense.\n\nThen, computing (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. I converted them to polar form, modulus sqrt(2), angles \u03c0/4 and -\u03c0/4 respectively. Raising to the 13th power, modulus becomes (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 sqrt(2). Angles become 13*(\u03c0/4) and 13*(-\u03c0/4). Then, simplifying the angles modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13*(\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0, but since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, subtract 2\u03c0 to get 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, for (1 - i)^13, the angle is -13\u03c0/4. Adding multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's within 0 to 2\u03c0. -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 3\u03c0/4.\n\nWait, wait a second, earlier I thought the angle was 5\u03c0/4, but now I'm getting 3\u03c0/4. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\n(1 + i)^13: angle is 13*(\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since 3\u03c0 is \u03c0 more than 2\u03c0, subtracting 2\u03c0 gives \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i*5\u03c0/4}.\n\n(1 - i)^13: angle is 13*(-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. To bring this within 0 to 2\u03c0, add 4\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/4): -13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4 = (-5\u03c0)/4. Still negative, add another 8\u03c0/4: (-5\u03c0/4) + 8\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So, angle is 3\u03c0/4. Therefore, e^{i*3\u03c0/4}.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, (1 + i)^13 is 64 sqrt(2) e^{i*5\u03c0/4} and (1 - i)^13 is 64 sqrt(2) e^{i*3\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, let's recompute (1 + i)^13.\n\ne^{i*5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) - i(\u221a2/2). So, multiplying by 64 sqrt(2):\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2) = 64 sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) + 64 sqrt(2) * (-i\u221a2/2).\n\nCompute each part:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * (- (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, 64 sqrt(2) * (-i\u221a2/2) = 64 * (-i * (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64*(-i*2/2) = 64*(-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is 64 sqrt(2) e^{i*3\u03c0/4}.\n\ne^{i*3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) + i(\u221a2/2).\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-\u221a2/2) + i(\u221a2/2) ].\n\nCompute each part:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = -64.\n\n64 sqrt(2) * i\u221a2/2 = 64 * i*(2)/2 = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, Q1 = 1 - (1 + i)^13 = 1 - (-64 -64i) = 1 +64 +64i = 65 +64i.\n\nQ2 = 1 - (1 - i)^13 = 1 - (-64 +64i) = 1 +64 -64i =65 -64i.\n\nThen, P = Q1 * Q2 = (65 +64i)(65 -64i) = 65^2 + (64)^2.\n\n65^2 is 4225, 64^2 is 4096. Sum is 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, remainder 321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but I had a moment where I thought I might have made a mistake in the angles, but after recalculating, I got the same result. So, I think the answer is 321.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check the key steps.\n\n1. Factor each term: x^2 -2x +2 = (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)). Correct.\n\n2. Then, the product becomes [product (\u03c9^k - (1+i))][product (\u03c9^k - (1-i))]. Correct.\n\n3. Each product is 1 - a^13, where a is (1+i) or (1-i). Correct.\n\n4. Calculated (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13 using polar form. Got -64 -64i and -64 +64i. Then, Q1 and Q2 are 65 +64i and 65 -64i.\n\n5. Their product is 65^2 +64^2 = 8321. Modulo 1000, 8321 mod 1000 is 321. Correct.\n\nSo, I think that's solid. The answer is 321.\n",

I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating, but let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy the equation \u03c9^n = 1 for some integer n. In this case, n is 13, so \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity because \u03c9 \u2260 1. That means \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k for k=1 to 12 are all the other roots.\n\nThe problem is asking about the product of terms of the form (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) for k from 0 to 12. So, I need to compute this product and then find its remainder modulo 1000.\n\nLet me write out the product:\n\nP = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\n\nI wonder if there's a way to simplify each term before multiplying them all together. Maybe I can factor each term or express it in a different form.\n\nLooking at each factor: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let's see if this can be rewritten. Maybe factor out a 2 from the first two terms:\n\n2(1 - \u03c9^k) + \u03c9^{2k}\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe treat it as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me let x = \u03c9^k for a moment.\n\nThen each term becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. Let me rearrange that: x^2 - 2x + 2.\n\nWait, that's a quadratic. Maybe I can factor it or find its roots. Let's compute the discriminant: D = (\u22122)^2 \u2212 4*1*2 = 4 \u2212 8 = -4. So, the roots are complex: [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo, x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Therefore, each term factors as (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nTherefore, the product becomes:\n\nP = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nP = [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))]\n\nSo, now I have two separate products. Let me focus on one of them, say Q = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a), where a is either (1 + i) or (1 - i).\n\nI recall that for roots of unity, the product over all \u03c9^k - a can be related to the cyclotomic polynomial or perhaps the minimal polynomial. Wait, the product of (x - \u03c9^k) for k from 0 to 12 is x^13 - 1, because the roots are exactly the 13th roots of unity.\n\nSo, if I set x = a, then the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = a^13 - 1.\n\nBut wait, in our case, it's \u220f (\u03c9^k - a) which is (-1)^13 times \u220f (a - \u03c9^k) because we can factor out a negative sign from each term. Since 13 is odd, (-1)^13 = -1.\n\nSo, \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = - (a^13 - 1) = 1 - a^13.\n\nTherefore, each of our Q terms is 1 - a^13, where a is (1 + i) or (1 - i).\n\nSo, for a = 1 + i, Q1 = 1 - (1 + i)^13.\n\nSimilarly, for a = 1 - i, Q2 = 1 - (1 - i)^13.\n\nTherefore, the entire product P = Q1 * Q2 = [1 - (1 + i)^13][1 - (1 - i)^13].\n\nHmm, so now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI remember that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. Let me compute that.\n\nThe modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is \u03c0/4 radians because it's in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has the same modulus, sqrt(2), but the argument is -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute [sqrt(2)]^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute 13\u03c0/4. Since 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to \u03c0/4 when considering angles modulo 2\u03c0. Because 3\u03c0 is \u03c0 + 2\u03c0, so subtracting 2\u03c0 gives \u03c0/4.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Let me compute 13 divided by 4: 3*4=12, so 13/4 = 3 + 1/4. So, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so let's subtract 2\u03c0 to get an equivalent angle between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\n3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me think again. 13\u03c0/4 is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is 3*180=540 degrees, which is 180 + 360 degrees, so subtracting 2\u03c0 (360 degrees) gives 180 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 13\u03c0/4 is 13 * 45 = 585 degrees. 585 - 360 = 225 degrees, which is 5\u03c0/4. So, 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 5\u03c0/4 in standard position.\n\nSimilarly, -13\u03c0/4 is the same as -5\u03c0/4. But since angles are periodic with 2\u03c0, adding 2\u03c0 to -5\u03c0/4 gives 3\u03c0/4.\n\nWait, let me verify: -13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4 = (-13 + 8)\u03c0/4 = (-5\u03c0)/4. Hmm, that's not positive. Let me add 2\u03c0 again: (-5\u03c0/4) + 8\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 3\u03c0/4} because adding 2\u03c0 brings it to the equivalent angle.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: e^{-i\u03b8} is the conjugate of e^{i\u03b8}, so e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} is the conjugate of e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}, which is e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the exponentials directly.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 5\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * (2\u03c0 - 13\u03c0/4)}.\n\nWait, 2\u03c0 is 8\u03c0/4, so 8\u03c0/4 - 13\u03c0/4 = -5\u03c0/4. But adding 2\u03c0 to -5\u03c0/4 gives 3\u03c0/4. So, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 3\u03c0/4}.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Alternatively, since e^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8, and e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) - i(\u221a2/2).\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = cos(13\u03c0/4) - i sin(13\u03c0/4) = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) - i(-\u221a2/2) = (-\u221a2/2) + i(\u221a2/2).\n\nWait, but 13\u03c0/4 is 5\u03c0/4 when reduced modulo 2\u03c0, so e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) - i(-\u221a2/2) = (-\u221a2/2) + i(\u221a2/2).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-\u221a2/2) - i(\u221a2/2) ]\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ (-\u221a2/2) + i(\u221a2/2) ]\n\nLet me compute these expressions.\n\nFirst, compute 64 * sqrt(2) multiplied by (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2).\n\nMultiply 64 * sqrt(2) by (-\u221a2/2):\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * (- (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part is 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i\u221a2/2) = 64 * (-i * (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64*(-i*2/2) = 64*(-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, for (1 - i)^13:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2) = same as above, except the imaginary part is positive.\n\nSo, real part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = -64.\n\nImaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (i\u221a2/2) = 64 * i*(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 = 64*i*(2)/2 = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nNow, going back to Q1 and Q2.\n\nQ1 = 1 - (1 + i)^13 = 1 - (-64 - 64i) = 1 + 64 + 64i = 65 + 64i.\n\nSimilarly, Q2 = 1 - (1 - i)^13 = 1 - (-64 + 64i) = 1 + 64 - 64i = 65 - 64i.\n\nTherefore, P = Q1 * Q2 = (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i).\n\nThis is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to (65)^2 + (64)^2.\n\nCompute 65^2: 65*65. Let me compute that: 60^2=3600, 5^2=25, and 2*60*5=600. So, (60+5)^2=60^2 + 2*60*5 +5^2= 3600 +600 +25=4225.\n\nSimilarly, 64^2 is 4096. Because 60^2=3600, 4^2=16, and 2*60*4=480, so (60+4)^2=3600+480+16=4096.\n\nSo, P = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, 4225 + 4096: 4000 + 4000 = 8000, 225 + 96=321, so total is 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nBut the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, compute 8321 mod 1000.\n\nDividing 8321 by 1000: 1000*8=8000, so 8321 - 8000 = 321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check all the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, when I factored each term as (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)), that seems correct because the quadratic x^2 - 2x +2 factors into (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)).\n\nThen, the product over all \u03c9^k of (\u03c9^k - a) is 1 - a^13, because the product of (x - \u03c9^k) is x^13 -1, so replacing x with a gives a^13 -1, but since we have (\u03c9^k - a), it's - (a - \u03c9^k), so the product becomes (-1)^13 (a^13 -1) = -(a^13 -1) = 1 - a^13. That makes sense.\n\nThen, computing (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. I converted them to polar form, modulus sqrt(2), angles \u03c0/4 and -\u03c0/4 respectively. Raising to the 13th power, modulus becomes (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 sqrt(2). Angles become 13*(\u03c0/4) and 13*(-\u03c0/4). Then, simplifying the angles modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n13*(\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0, but since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, subtract 2\u03c0 to get 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, for (1 - i)^13, the angle is -13\u03c0/4. Adding multiples of 2\u03c0 until it's within 0 to 2\u03c0. -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So, the angle is 3\u03c0/4.\n\nWait, wait a second, earlier I thought the angle was 5\u03c0/4, but now I'm getting 3\u03c0/4. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\n(1 + i)^13: angle is 13*(\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since 3\u03c0 is \u03c0 more than 2\u03c0, subtracting 2\u03c0 gives \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i*5\u03c0/4}.\n\n(1 - i)^13: angle is 13*(-\u03c0/4) = -13\u03c0/4. To bring this within 0 to 2\u03c0, add 4\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/4): -13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4 = (-5\u03c0)/4. Still negative, add another 8\u03c0/4: (-5\u03c0/4) + 8\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So, angle is 3\u03c0/4. Therefore, e^{i*3\u03c0/4}.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, (1 + i)^13 is 64 sqrt(2) e^{i*5\u03c0/4} and (1 - i)^13 is 64 sqrt(2) e^{i*3\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, let's recompute (1 + i)^13.\n\ne^{i*5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) - i(\u221a2/2). So, multiplying by 64 sqrt(2):\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2) = 64 sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) + 64 sqrt(2) * (-i\u221a2/2).\n\nCompute each part:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * (- (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, 64 sqrt(2) * (-i\u221a2/2) = 64 * (-i * (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64*(-i*2/2) = 64*(-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is 64 sqrt(2) e^{i*3\u03c0/4}.\n\ne^{i*3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) + i(\u221a2/2).\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-\u221a2/2) + i(\u221a2/2) ].\n\nCompute each part:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = -64.\n\n64 sqrt(2) * i\u221a2/2 = 64 * i*(2)/2 = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nSo, Q1 = 1 - (1 + i)^13 = 1 - (-64 -64i) = 1 +64 +64i = 65 +64i.\n\nQ2 = 1 - (1 - i)^13 = 1 - (-64 +64i) = 1 +64 -64i =65 -64i.\n\nThen, P = Q1 * Q2 = (65 +64i)(65 -64i) = 65^2 + (64)^2.\n\n65^2 is 4225, 64^2 is 4096. Sum is 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, remainder 321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but I had a moment where I thought I might have made a mistake in the angles, but after recalculating, I got the same result. So, I think the answer is 321.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check the key steps.\n\n1. Factor each term: x^2 -2x +2 = (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)). Correct.\n\n2. Then, the product becomes [product (\u03c9^k - (1+i))][product (\u03c9^k - (1-i))]. Correct.\n\n3. Each product is 1 - a^13, where a is (1+i) or (1-i). Correct.\n\n4. Calculated (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13 using polar form. Got -64 -64i and -64 +64i. Then, Q1 and Q2 are 65 +64i and 65 -64i.\n\n5. Their product is 65^2 +64^2 = 8321. Modulo 1000, 8321 mod 1000 is 321. Correct.\n\nSo, I think that's solid. The answer is 321.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive 13th root of unity.\n\nFirst, each term \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\) is factored as \\((\\omega^k - (1 + i))(\\omega^k - (1 - i))\\). The entire product becomes:\n\n\\[\nP = \\left(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 + i))\\right) \\left(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 - i))\\right)\n\\]\n\nUsing properties of roots of unity, each product is simplified to \\(1 - (1 + i)^{13}\\) and \\(1 - (1 - i)^{13}\\). \n\nCalculating \\((1 + i)^{13}\\) and \\((1 - i)^{13}\\) in polar form, we find:\n\n\\[\n(1 + i)^{13} = -64 - 64i \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (1 - i)^{13} = -64 + 64i\n\\]\n\nThus, the products are:\n\n\\[\n1 - (-64 - 64i) = 65 + 64i \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 1 - (-64 + 64i) = 65 - 64i\n\\]\n\nMultiplying these results:\n\n\\[\n(65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65^2 + 64^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321\n\\]\n\nFinally, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is:\n\n\\[\n8321 \\mod 1000 = 321\n\\]\n\n\\boxed{321}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let's try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k for k=0,1,...,12 are all distinct. Also, the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. Wait, no, actually, the cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1 because 13 is prime. So that might come in handy later.\n\nNow, the product I need to compute is \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). That's 13 terms multiplied together. Since \u03c9^0 = 1, the first term when k=0 is (2 - 2*1 + 1^0) = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is 1, which doesn't change the product. So really, the product is the same as from k=1 to 12.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check that. When k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1, so the term is 2 - 2*1 + (1)^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So yeah, that term is 1, so the product is just the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nHmm, okay. So I need to compute this big product. It seems like something that might relate to polynomials evaluated at certain points. Maybe I can think of this as evaluating a polynomial at specific roots of unity.\n\nLet me define f(x) = 2 - 2x + x\u00b2. Then, the product we're looking at is the product of f(\u03c9^k) for k=1 to 12. So, \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} f(\u03c9^k).\n\nWait, but the product over k=1 to 12 of f(\u03c9^k) is equal to the product over all non-1 13th roots of unity of f(\u03c9^k). So, if I can express this product in terms of the value of some polynomial evaluated at the roots, maybe I can use properties of cyclotomic polynomials.\n\nI recall that for a polynomial P(x), the product over all roots \u03b1 of P of (x - \u03b1) is P(x). But here, I have a product of f(\u03c9^k) for each \u03c9^k being a root of \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x). Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can relate this product to the resultant or something else. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the product over all \u03c9^k (k=1 to 12) of f(\u03c9^k) is equal to the product over all \u03c9^k of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nLet me write f(\u03c9^k) as 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me see if I can factor this expression or relate it to another polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor f(x) = 2 - 2x + x\u00b2. Let's see: x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So f(x) factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nBut wait, maybe that's useful. So, f(x) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, then the product \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} f(\u03c9^k) is equal to \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich is equal to [\u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [\u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nHmm, each of these products can be related to the value of the cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at (1 + i) and (1 - i). Because \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k), so \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a^{-1}) * a^{12}? Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully.\n\nWait, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. Also, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k). So, if I set x = a, then \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k). Therefore, \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^{12} \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a).\n\nSo, because 12 is even, (-1)^12 is 1. Therefore, \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a). So, going back, the product \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i), and similarly, \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, the entire product is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\nSo, now, I need to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i), then multiply them together.\n\nBut what is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x)? As I mentioned earlier, since 13 is prime, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. Alternatively, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) can be written as (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1), which might be useful.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1). So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] / [ (1 + i) - 1 ].\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [ ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ] / [ (1 - i) - 1 ].\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i 13 \u03c0/4}.\n\nWait, let's compute (1 + i)^13.\n\n(1 + i)^1 = 1 + i\n\n(1 + i)^2 = (1 + i)(1 + i) = 1 + 2i + i\u00b2 = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i\n\n(1 + i)^3 = (1 + i)^2 * (1 + i) = 2i*(1 + i) = 2i + 2i\u00b2 = 2i - 2 = -2 + 2i\n\n(1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4\n\n(1 + i)^5 = (-4)(1 + i) = -4 - 4i\n\n(1 + i)^6 = (-4 - 4i)(1 + i) = (-4)(1) + (-4)(i) + (-4i)(1) + (-4i)(i) = -4 -4i -4i +4 = 0 -8i\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy. Alternatively, since (1 + i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4, (1 + i)^n has magnitude (sqrt(2))^n and angle n\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, for n=13, the angle is 13\u03c0/4. But 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*1 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, (1 + i)^13 has magnitude (sqrt(2))^13 and angle 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13: 1 - i has magnitude sqrt(2), angle -\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 has magnitude (sqrt(2))^13, angle -13\u03c0/4. Which is equivalent to -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 +16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * (cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)) = (sqrt(2))^13 * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * (cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4)) = (sqrt(2))^13 * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nBut wait, let me compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) ]\n\nCompute that: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2)/2 * (-1) = 64 * (-1) = -64. So, (1 + i)^13 = -64*(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) ]\n\nWhich is 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) * (1 - i) = 64*(-1)*(1 - i) = -64*(1 - i).\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2, so 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64. So yes, correct.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64*(1 + i)\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64*(1 - i)\n\nSo, let's plug this back into \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\n\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] / [ (1 + i) - 1 ].\n\nWe have (1 + i)^13 = -64*(1 + i), so numerator is (-64*(1 + i) - 1) = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nDenominator is (1 + i) - 1 = i.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = (-65 -64i)/i. Let's simplify that. Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:\n\n(-65 -64i)/i = (-65 -64i)*(-i)/(i*(-i)) = (65i +64i\u00b2)/(1) = 65i -64.\n\nBecause i*(-i) = -i\u00b2 = 1. So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = 65i -64.\n\nSimilarly, compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i):\n\n(1 - i)^13 = -64*(1 - i)\n\nNumerator is (-64*(1 - i) - 1) = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nDenominator is (1 - i) - 1 = -i.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i). Let's simplify:\n\n(-65 +64i)/(-i) = (-65 +64i)*i/( -i * i ) = (-65i +64i\u00b2)/(1) = (-65i -64).\n\nBecause i*(-i) = -i\u00b2 = 1. So \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = -65i -64.\n\nWait, let me double-check that step:\n\nWait, (-65 +64i)/(-i) = multiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\nNumerator: (-65 +64i)*i = -65i +64i\u00b2 = -65i -64.\n\nDenominator: (-i)*i = -i\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo yes, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = -65i -64.\n\nSo, now, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = 65i -64 and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = -65i -64.\n\nSo, the product \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) is (65i -64)(-65i -64).\n\nLet me compute this product.\n\nLet me write it as (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i). That looks like (a + b)(a - b) where a = -64 and b =65i. Wait, no, actually, a = -64 and b =65i? Wait, no, (-64 +65i) and (-64 -65i). Wait, actually, it's (a + b)(a - b) where a = -64 and b =65i. So, the product is a\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = (-64)^2 = 4096.\n\nb\u00b2 = (65i)^2 = 4225 i\u00b2 = -4225.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 4096 - (-4225) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nWait, that's a nice number. So, the product is 8321.\n\nTherefore, the original product \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = 8321.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm the multiplication step again:\n\n(65i -64)(-65i -64) = (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225)(i\u00b2) = 4096 - (4225)(-1) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Now, the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 mod 1000.\n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 = 8000, with a remainder of 321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. 1000*8=8000, 8321-8000=321, yes.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations earlier. Let me recap:\n\n1. The product is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), but since when k=0, the term is 1, the product is same as from k=1 to 12.\n\n2. Expressed each term as f(\u03c9^k) where f(x) = 2 - 2x + x\u00b2.\n\n3. Factored f(x) as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\n4. Then, the product becomes \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\n5. Which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\n6. Computed \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) using the fact that \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\n7. Found (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\n8. Plugged into \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) to get \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = 65i -64, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = -65i -64.\n\n9. Multiplied them together to get 8321.\n\n10. Took modulo 1000 to get 321.\n\nWait, but 8321 is correct?\n\nWait, let me recompute (65i -64)(-65i -64):\n\nFirst, expand it:\n\n= (-64)(-64) + (-64)(-65i) + (65i)(-64) + (65i)(-65i)\n\n= 4096 + 4160i - 4160i -4225i\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 4096 + (4160i -4160i) + (-4225)(-1)\n\n= 4096 + 0 + 4225\n\n= 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the product is 8321, which mod 1000 is 321.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 321 when the product is divided by 1000.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning \u03c9\u00b9\u00b3 = 1 and \u03c9 \u2260 1. The product we need to compute is:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\n\\]\n\nSince \u03c9\u2070 = 1, the term when k=0 is (2 - 2*1 + 1) = 1.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let's try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k for k=0,1,...,12 are all distinct. Also, the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. Wait, no, actually, the cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1 because 13 is prime. So that might come in handy later.\n\nNow, the product I need to compute is \u03a0_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). That's 13 terms multiplied together. Since \u03c9^0 = 1, the first term when k=0 is (2 - 2*1 + 1^0) = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is 1, which doesn't change the product. So really, the product is the same as from k=1 to 12.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check that. When k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1, so the term is 2 - 2*1 + (1)^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So yeah, that term is 1, so the product is just the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nHmm, okay. So I need to compute this big product. It seems like something that might relate to polynomials evaluated at certain points. Maybe I can think of this as evaluating a polynomial at specific roots of unity.\n\nLet me define f(x) = 2 - 2x + x\u00b2. Then, the product we're looking at is the product of f(\u03c9^k) for k=1 to 12. So, \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} f(\u03c9^k).\n\nWait, but the product over k=1 to 12 of f(\u03c9^k) is equal to the product over all non-1 13th roots of unity of f(\u03c9^k). So, if I can express this product in terms of the value of some polynomial evaluated at the roots, maybe I can use properties of cyclotomic polynomials.\n\nI recall that for a polynomial P(x), the product over all roots \u03b1 of P of (x - \u03b1) is P(x). But here, I have a product of f(\u03c9^k) for each \u03c9^k being a root of \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x). Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can relate this product to the resultant or something else. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the product over all \u03c9^k (k=1 to 12) of f(\u03c9^k) is equal to the product over all \u03c9^k of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nLet me write f(\u03c9^k) as 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me see if I can factor this expression or relate it to another polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor f(x) = 2 - 2x + x\u00b2. Let's see: x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So f(x) factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nBut wait, maybe that's useful. So, f(x) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, then the product \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} f(\u03c9^k) is equal to \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich is equal to [\u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [\u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nHmm, each of these products can be related to the value of the cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at (1 + i) and (1 - i). Because \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k), so \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a^{-1}) * a^{12}? Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully.\n\nWait, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. Also, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k). So, if I set x = a, then \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a) = \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k). Therefore, \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^{12} \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (a - \u03c9^k) = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a).\n\nSo, because 12 is even, (-1)^12 is 1. Therefore, \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(a). So, going back, the product \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i)) is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i), and similarly, \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i)) is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\nTherefore, the entire product is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\nSo, now, I need to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i), then multiply them together.\n\nBut what is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x)? As I mentioned earlier, since 13 is prime, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. Alternatively, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) can be written as (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1), which might be useful.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1). So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] / [ (1 + i) - 1 ].\n\nSimilarly, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = [ ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ] / [ (1 - i) - 1 ].\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^13. I know that 1 + i has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i 13 \u03c0/4}.\n\nWait, let's compute (1 + i)^13.\n\n(1 + i)^1 = 1 + i\n\n(1 + i)^2 = (1 + i)(1 + i) = 1 + 2i + i\u00b2 = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i\n\n(1 + i)^3 = (1 + i)^2 * (1 + i) = 2i*(1 + i) = 2i + 2i\u00b2 = 2i - 2 = -2 + 2i\n\n(1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4\n\n(1 + i)^5 = (-4)(1 + i) = -4 - 4i\n\n(1 + i)^6 = (-4 - 4i)(1 + i) = (-4)(1) + (-4)(i) + (-4i)(1) + (-4i)(i) = -4 -4i -4i +4 = 0 -8i\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy. Alternatively, since (1 + i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4, (1 + i)^n has magnitude (sqrt(2))^n and angle n\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, for n=13, the angle is 13\u03c0/4. But 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*1 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, (1 + i)^13 has magnitude (sqrt(2))^13 and angle 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13: 1 - i has magnitude sqrt(2), angle -\u03c0/4. So, (1 - i)^13 has magnitude (sqrt(2))^13, angle -13\u03c0/4. Which is equivalent to -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 +16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * (cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)) = (sqrt(2))^13 * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * (cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4)) = (sqrt(2))^13 * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nBut wait, let me compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) ]\n\nCompute that: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2)/2 * (-1) = 64 * (-1) = -64. So, (1 + i)^13 = -64*(1 + i).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) ]\n\nWhich is 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) * (1 - i) = 64*(-1)*(1 - i) = -64*(1 - i).\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2, so 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64. So yes, correct.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64*(1 + i)\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64*(1 - i)\n\nSo, let's plug this back into \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\n\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] / [ (1 + i) - 1 ].\n\nWe have (1 + i)^13 = -64*(1 + i), so numerator is (-64*(1 + i) - 1) = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nDenominator is (1 + i) - 1 = i.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = (-65 -64i)/i. Let's simplify that. Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:\n\n(-65 -64i)/i = (-65 -64i)*(-i)/(i*(-i)) = (65i +64i\u00b2)/(1) = 65i -64.\n\nBecause i*(-i) = -i\u00b2 = 1. So, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = 65i -64.\n\nSimilarly, compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i):\n\n(1 - i)^13 = -64*(1 - i)\n\nNumerator is (-64*(1 - i) - 1) = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nDenominator is (1 - i) - 1 = -i.\n\nSo, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i). Let's simplify:\n\n(-65 +64i)/(-i) = (-65 +64i)*i/( -i * i ) = (-65i +64i\u00b2)/(1) = (-65i -64).\n\nBecause i*(-i) = -i\u00b2 = 1. So \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = -65i -64.\n\nWait, let me double-check that step:\n\nWait, (-65 +64i)/(-i) = multiply numerator and denominator by i:\n\nNumerator: (-65 +64i)*i = -65i +64i\u00b2 = -65i -64.\n\nDenominator: (-i)*i = -i\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo yes, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = -65i -64.\n\nSo, now, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = 65i -64 and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = -65i -64.\n\nSo, the product \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) is (65i -64)(-65i -64).\n\nLet me compute this product.\n\nLet me write it as (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i). That looks like (a + b)(a - b) where a = -64 and b =65i. Wait, no, actually, a = -64 and b =65i? Wait, no, (-64 +65i) and (-64 -65i). Wait, actually, it's (a + b)(a - b) where a = -64 and b =65i. So, the product is a\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = (-64)^2 = 4096.\n\nb\u00b2 = (65i)^2 = 4225 i\u00b2 = -4225.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 4096 - (-4225) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nWait, that's a nice number. So, the product is 8321.\n\nTherefore, the original product \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = 8321.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm the multiplication step again:\n\n(65i -64)(-65i -64) = (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225)(i\u00b2) = 4096 - (4225)(-1) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Now, the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 mod 1000.\n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 = 8000, with a remainder of 321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. 1000*8=8000, 8321-8000=321, yes.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations earlier. Let me recap:\n\n1. The product is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), but since when k=0, the term is 1, the product is same as from k=1 to 12.\n\n2. Expressed each term as f(\u03c9^k) where f(x) = 2 - 2x + x\u00b2.\n\n3. Factored f(x) as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\n4. Then, the product becomes \u03a0_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\n5. Which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i).\n\n6. Computed \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) using the fact that \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1).\n\n7. Found (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).\n\n8. Plugged into \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) to get \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 + i) = 65i -64, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1 - i) = -65i -64.\n\n9. Multiplied them together to get 8321.\n\n10. Took modulo 1000 to get 321.\n\nWait, but 8321 is correct?\n\nWait, let me recompute (65i -64)(-65i -64):\n\nFirst, expand it:\n\n= (-64)(-64) + (-64)(-65i) + (65i)(-64) + (65i)(-65i)\n\n= 4096 + 4160i - 4160i -4225i\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 4096 + (4160i -4160i) + (-4225)(-1)\n\n= 4096 + 0 + 4225\n\n= 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the product is 8321, which mod 1000 is 321.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 321 when the product is divided by 1000.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning \u03c9\u00b9\u00b3 = 1 and \u03c9 \u2260 1. The product we need to compute is:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\n\\]\n\nSince \u03c9\u2070 = 1, the term when k=0 is (2 - 2*1 + 1) = 1. Thus, the product simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\n\\]\n\nWe define the polynomial \\( f(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2 \\), which factors as \\( f(x) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)) \\). Therefore, the product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=1}^{12} f(\\omega^k) = \\prod_{k=1}^{12} (\\omega^k - (1 + i))(\\omega^k - (1 - i))\n\\]\n\nThis can be rewritten using the properties of cyclotomic polynomials. Specifically, for the 13th cyclotomic polynomial \\( \\Phi_{13}(x) = \\prod_{k=1}^{12} (x - \\omega^k) \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=1}^{12} (\\omega^k - a) = \\Phi_{13}(a)\n\\]\n\nThus, the product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{13}(1 + i) \\cdot \\Phi_{13}(1 - i)\n\\]\n\nWe compute \\( \\Phi_{13}(1 + i) \\) and \\( \\Phi_{13}(1 - i) \\) using the fact that \\( \\Phi_{13}(x) = \\frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1} \\). Calculating \\( (1 + i)^{13} \\) and \\( (1 - i)^{13} \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n(1 + i)^{13} = -64(1 + i), \\quad (1 - i)^{13} = -64(1 - i)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these into the cyclotomic polynomial expressions, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{13}(1 + i) = \\frac{(-64(1 + i) - 1)}{i} = 65i - 64\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Phi_{13}(1 - i) = \\frac{(-64(1 - i) - 1)}{-i} = -65i - 64\n\\]\n\nMultiplying these results:\n\n\\[\n(65i - 64)(-65i - 64) = 8321\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000:\n\n\\[\n8321 \\mod 1000 = 321\n\\]\n\nThus, the remainder is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{321}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, it means that \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k for k from 1 to 12 are all distinct roots. Also, the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. Wait, is that right? Let me think. The cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6_n(x) is the product of (x - \u03c9) where \u03c9 runs over the primitive n-th roots of unity. For prime n, like 13, it's (x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} + ... + x + 1). So, yes, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1.\n\nBut how does that help me here? I need to compute a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Hmm. Let's write out the product:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\n\nI notice that for k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1, so the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the first term is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So really, the product is from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nNow, let me denote each term as f(\u03c9^k) where f(x) = 2 - 2x + x\u00b2. So, f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Wait, that's a quadratic. Maybe I can factor this or find its roots?\n\nLet me compute the discriminant: D = (-2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So f(x) factors as (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)).\n\nSo, each term in the product is (\u03c9^k - (1+i))(\u03c9^k - (1-i)). Therefore, the entire product is the product over k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1+i))(\u03c9^k - (1-i)).\n\nBut since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, \u03c9^k for k=1 to 12 are all the primitive roots. So, the product can be written as:\n\nProduct = [Product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1+i))] * [Product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1-i))]\n\nWhich is equal to [\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1+i)] * [\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1-i)]. Because \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k=1 to 12, right? So substituting x with (1+i) and (1-i), we get these products.\n\nSo, Product = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1+i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1-i).\n\nNow, I need to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1+i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1-i). Since \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1, maybe I can compute this value.\n\nBut evaluating \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1+i) seems complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate this product to some other polynomial or use properties of roots of unity.\n\nWait, another thought: The product over k=0 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) is x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1, because \u03c9^k are the 13th roots of unity. So, x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1 = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k). So, if I take x = 1+i, then (1+i)^13 - 1 = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (1+i - \u03c9^k). Similarly for x=1-i.\n\nBut in our case, the products start from k=1, so \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (1+i - \u03c9^k) = [(1+i)^13 - 1]/(1+i - 1) = [(1+i)^13 - 1]/(i). Similarly, \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (1-i - \u03c9^k) = [(1-i)^13 - 1]/(-i).\n\nWait, let me check that. For the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1. So, \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1). Because when x=1, the product would include (1 - 1) which is zero, so we divide by (x - 1) to exclude k=0.\n\nTherefore, \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1). So, in our case, substituting x = 1+i and x = 1-i, we get:\n\n\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1+i) = ( (1+i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1+i) - 1 ) = [ (1+i)^13 - 1 ] / i\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1-i) = ( (1-i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1-i) - 1 ) = [ (1-i)^13 - 1 ] / (-i )\n\nSo, the product is:\n\nProduct = [ ( (1+i)^13 - 1 ) / i ] * [ ( (1-i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i) ] \n\nSimplify the denominator: i * (-i) = -i\u00b2 = -(-1) = 1. So, denominators multiply to 1. So,\n\nProduct = [ ( (1+i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1-i)^13 - 1 ) ] / (i * (-i)) \n\nBut wait, let me compute the denominators correctly. The first term is divided by i, the second by (-i). So, overall, it's [ (1+i)^13 -1 ] / i * [ (1-i)^13 -1 ] / (-i ) \n\nWhich is [ (1+i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1-i)^13 -1 ] / (i*(-i)) \n\nSince i*(-i) = -i\u00b2 = 1. So, the denominator is 1. So,\n\nProduct = [ (1+i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1-i)^13 -1 ]\n\nHmm, okay, so I need to compute (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13, then subtract 1 from each, multiply them together.\n\nLet me compute (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13.\n\nI know that 1+i can be represented in polar form. Let's recall that 1+i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4. So,\n\n1+i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}\n\nSimilarly, 1-i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponents:\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = (12 + 1) * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with 2\u03c0, we can subtract 2\u03c0 to find the equivalent angle.\n\n3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0/4. So, subtracting 2\u03c0 gives \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = (5\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0) = 5\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = -3\u03c0/4. But adding 2\u03c0 to make it positive: -3\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nWait, but 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 is 13\u03c0/4, which is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. So, 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so subtract 2\u03c0: 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, for (1-i)^13, the angle is -13\u03c0/4. Let's compute that:\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 to get it within 0 to 2\u03c0: -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = \u03c0 - \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i 5\u03c0/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) [ cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) ] = 64 * sqrt(2) [ (-\u221a2/2) - i\u221a2/2 ) ] = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2 )\n\nCompute this:\n\nsqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 = 2/2 = 1.\n\nSo,\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part is 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2 i) = -64i.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i 3\u03c0/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) [ cos(3\u03c0/4) - i sin(3\u03c0/4) ] = 64 * sqrt(2) [ (-\u221a2/2) - i (\u221a2/2) ]\n\nWait, hold on: cos(3\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2, sin(3\u03c0/4) = \u221a2/2, so e^{-i 3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) - i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) - i (\u221a2/2). So,\n\n(1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) [ (-\u221a2/2) - i (\u221a2/2) ] = 64 * [ (-1) - i ].\n\nWait, let me compute this:\n\nsqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 = 1, so 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2 i) = -64i.\n\nWait, wait, no: in the expression, it's [ (-\u221a2/2) - i (\u221a2/2) ]. So, when multiplied by 64 * sqrt(2):\n\nReal part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64\n\nImaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) i = 64*(-1) i = -64i.\n\nWait, but in the case of (1 - i)^13, the angle was 3\u03c0/4, so sin is positive, but in the exponent, it's e^{-i 3\u03c0/4}, so it's cos(3\u03c0/4) - i sin(3\u03c0/4), which is the same as cos(3\u03c0/4) + i (-sin(3\u03c0/4)).\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for (1 - i)^13. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, earlier, I said that (1 - i)^13 has angle -13\u03c0/4, which we converted to 3\u03c0/4 by adding 4\u03c0 (since -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4). So, e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i 3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) - i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) - i (\u221a2/2). So, yeah, the same as (1+i)^13 but with the same angle.\n\nWait, but when I compute (1 - i)^13, it's (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = 64 sqrt(2) e^{-i 3\u03c0/4} = 64 sqrt(2) [ cos(3\u03c0/4) - i sin(3\u03c0/4) ].\n\nWhich is 64 sqrt(2) [ (-\u221a2/2) - i (\u221a2/2) ] = 64 sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) + 64 sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) i\n\nWhich is 64*(-1) + 64*(-1)i = -64 -64i. So, (1 - i)^13 is also -64 -64i? That can't be right, because (1+i) and (1-i) are conjugates, so their 13th powers should be conjugates as well.\n\nWait, hold on, (1+i)^13 is -64 -64i, so (1 - i)^13 should be the conjugate, which is -64 +64i. But according to the calculation above, I got -64 -64i. That's a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's recast the angle correctly. For (1 - i)^13, the angle is -13\u03c0/4. Let's compute that:\n\n-13\u03c0/4 is the same as 2\u03c0 - 13\u03c0/4 = (8\u03c0 - 13\u03c0)/4 = (-5\u03c0)/4. But that's still negative. Alternatively, add 2\u03c0: -13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 8\u03c0)/4 = (-5\u03c0)/4. Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, add 4\u03c0: -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So, e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i 3\u03c0/4}, because angles are modulo 2\u03c0.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because e^{-i\u03b8} = e^{i(-\u03b8)}, so e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i (-13\u03c0/4)}. But -13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 3\u03c0/4 when adding 4\u03c0 (since -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4). So, e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i 3\u03c0/4}.\n\nWait, that means (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i 3\u03c0/4} = 64 sqrt(2) [ cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) ] = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-\u221a2/2) + i (\u221a2/2) ] = 64*(-1) + 64i. So, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So I must have messed up the sign in the previous step. So, (1+i)^13 is -64 -64i, and (1 - i)^13 is -64 +64i.\n\nSo, now, let's compute (1+i)^13 -1 and (1 - i)^13 -1.\n\n(1+i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i\n\n(1 -i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i\n\nSo, the product is (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i). That's a product of complex conjugates, so it's equal to (-65)^2 + (64)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(-65)^2 = 4225\n\n64^2 = 4096\n\nSo, 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, that was the product after the denominators canceled. So, the original product is 8321. But wait, let me check my earlier steps again because I might have missed something.\n\nWait, no: I had Product = [ (1+i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1-i)^13 -1 ] / (i*(-i)) which is equal to [ (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) ] / 1 = (65^2 + 64^2) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Now, I need to compute 8321 mod 1000.\n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 = 8000, 8321 - 8000 = 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation.\n\nLet me recompute (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13.\n\n(1+i) is sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}, so (1+i)^13 is (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i 13\u03c0/4}.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to \u03c0/4 in the third revolution. So, 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i 5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) - i\u221a2/2.\n\nMultiply by (sqrt(2))^13 = (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{6.5} = 64 * sqrt(2). So,\n\n(1+i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * ( (-\u221a2/2) - i\u221a2/2 ) = 64 sqrt(2)*(-\u221a2/2) + 64 sqrt(2)*(-i\u221a2/2)\n\nCompute 64 sqrt(2)*(-\u221a2/2): sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2, so 64*(2)/2*(-1) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 sqrt(2)*(-\u221a2/2) i = -64i.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = -64 -64i. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = 64 sqrt(2) e^{-i (13\u03c0/4)}. 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, so e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i \u03c0/4} e^{-i 3\u03c0} = e^{-i \u03c0/4} (-1)^3 = e^{-i \u03c0/4} (-1).\n\nBut e^{-i \u03c0/4} is cos(\u03c0/4) - i sin(\u03c0/4) = \u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * (-1) * (\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2 ) = 64 sqrt(2)*(-1) * (\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2 )\n\nCompute 64 sqrt(2)*(-1)*(\u221a2/2): 64*(-1)*(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1)*(2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nImaginary part: 64 sqrt(2)*(-1)*(-i\u221a2/2) = 64 sqrt(2)*i sqrt(2)/2 = 64*(2)/2 i = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 -i)^13 = -64 +64i. Correct.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 -1 = -65 -64i, (1 -i)^13 -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nMultiply them: (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(i^2). Wait, wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.\n\nIt's a product of (a + b)(a - b) where a = -65, b = -64i. So, it's a^2 - b^2.\n\na^2 = (-65)^2 = 4225.\n\nb^2 = (-64i)^2 = (-64)^2 * i^2 = 4096*(-1) = -4096.\n\nSo, a^2 - b^2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 + 321, so the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check if I considered all the steps correctly. Did I miss any step where I might have miscalculated?\n\nAnother way to think about it: since the product is 8321, which is 8321 mod 1000. 8321 divided by 1000 is 8, remainder 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that my initial steps were correct. I started by noting that the product is \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) which I transformed into \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1+i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1-i). Then, using the fact that \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 -1)/(x -1), I substituted x=1+i and x=1-i, computed their products, and ended up with 8321.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I could have approached this problem by considering the minimal polynomials or using other properties of roots of unity, but I think the method I used is solid.\n\nSo, I think the remainder is 321 when the product is divided by 1000.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, it means that \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k for k from 1 to 12 are all distinct roots. Also, the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. Wait, is that right? Let me think. The cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6_n(x) is the product of (x - \u03c9) where \u03c9 runs over the primitive n-th roots of unity. For prime n, like 13, it's (x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} + ... + x + 1). So, yes, \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1.\n\nBut how does that help me here? I need to compute a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Hmm. Let's write out the product:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\n\nI notice that for k=0, \u03c9^0 = 1, so the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the first term is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So really, the product is from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nNow, let me denote each term as f(\u03c9^k) where f(x) = 2 - 2x + x\u00b2. So, f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Wait, that's a quadratic. Maybe I can factor this or find its roots?\n\nLet me compute the discriminant: D = (-2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So f(x) factors as (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)).\n\nSo, each term in the product is (\u03c9^k - (1+i))(\u03c9^k - (1-i)). Therefore, the entire product is the product over k=1 to 12 of (\u03c9^k - (1+i))(\u03c9^k - (1-i)).\n\nBut since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, \u03c9^k for k=1 to 12 are all the primitive roots. So, the product can be written as:\n\nProduct = [Product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1+i))] * [Product_{k=1}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1-i))]\n\nWhich is equal to [\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1+i)] * [\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1-i)]. Because \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the product over (x - \u03c9^k) for k=1 to 12, right? So substituting x with (1+i) and (1-i), we get these products.\n\nSo, Product = \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1+i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1-i).\n\nNow, I need to compute \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1+i) and \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1-i). Since \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1, maybe I can compute this value.\n\nBut evaluating \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1+i) seems complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate this product to some other polynomial or use properties of roots of unity.\n\nWait, another thought: The product over k=0 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) is x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1, because \u03c9^k are the 13th roots of unity. So, x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1 = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k). So, if I take x = 1+i, then (1+i)^13 - 1 = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (1+i - \u03c9^k). Similarly for x=1-i.\n\nBut in our case, the products start from k=1, so \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (1+i - \u03c9^k) = [(1+i)^13 - 1]/(1+i - 1) = [(1+i)^13 - 1]/(i). Similarly, \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (1-i - \u03c9^k) = [(1-i)^13 - 1]/(-i).\n\nWait, let me check that. For the product \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1. So, \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1). Because when x=1, the product would include (1 - 1) which is zero, so we divide by (x - 1) to exclude k=0.\n\nTherefore, \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1)/(x - 1). So, in our case, substituting x = 1+i and x = 1-i, we get:\n\n\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1+i) = ( (1+i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1+i) - 1 ) = [ (1+i)^13 - 1 ] / i\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\u03a6\u2081\u2083(1-i) = ( (1-i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1-i) - 1 ) = [ (1-i)^13 - 1 ] / (-i )\n\nSo, the product is:\n\nProduct = [ ( (1+i)^13 - 1 ) / i ] * [ ( (1-i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i) ] \n\nSimplify the denominator: i * (-i) = -i\u00b2 = -(-1) = 1. So, denominators multiply to 1. So,\n\nProduct = [ ( (1+i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1-i)^13 - 1 ) ] / (i * (-i)) \n\nBut wait, let me compute the denominators correctly. The first term is divided by i, the second by (-i). So, overall, it's [ (1+i)^13 -1 ] / i * [ (1-i)^13 -1 ] / (-i ) \n\nWhich is [ (1+i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1-i)^13 -1 ] / (i*(-i)) \n\nSince i*(-i) = -i\u00b2 = 1. So, the denominator is 1. So,\n\nProduct = [ (1+i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1-i)^13 -1 ]\n\nHmm, okay, so I need to compute (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13, then subtract 1 from each, multiply them together.\n\nLet me compute (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13.\n\nI know that 1+i can be represented in polar form. Let's recall that 1+i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4. So,\n\n1+i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}\n\nSimilarly, 1-i = sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}\n\nSimilarly, (1-i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponents:\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = (12 + 1) * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since e^{i\u03b8} is periodic with 2\u03c0, we can subtract 2\u03c0 to find the equivalent angle.\n\n3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0/4. So, subtracting 2\u03c0 gives \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = (5\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0) = 5\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = -3\u03c0/4. But adding 2\u03c0 to make it positive: -3\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nWait, but 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 is 13\u03c0/4, which is equal to 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. So, 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so subtract 2\u03c0: 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, for (1-i)^13, the angle is -13\u03c0/4. Let's compute that:\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 to get it within 0 to 2\u03c0: -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = \u03c0 - \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i 5\u03c0/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) [ cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) ] = 64 * sqrt(2) [ (-\u221a2/2) - i\u221a2/2 ) ] = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2 )\n\nCompute this:\n\nsqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 = 2/2 = 1.\n\nSo,\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part is 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2 i) = -64i.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i 3\u03c0/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) [ cos(3\u03c0/4) - i sin(3\u03c0/4) ] = 64 * sqrt(2) [ (-\u221a2/2) - i (\u221a2/2) ]\n\nWait, hold on: cos(3\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2, sin(3\u03c0/4) = \u221a2/2, so e^{-i 3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) - i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) - i (\u221a2/2). So,\n\n(1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) [ (-\u221a2/2) - i (\u221a2/2) ] = 64 * [ (-1) - i ].\n\nWait, let me compute this:\n\nsqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 = 1, so 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2 i) = -64i.\n\nWait, wait, no: in the expression, it's [ (-\u221a2/2) - i (\u221a2/2) ]. So, when multiplied by 64 * sqrt(2):\n\nReal part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64\n\nImaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) i = 64*(-1) i = -64i.\n\nWait, but in the case of (1 - i)^13, the angle was 3\u03c0/4, so sin is positive, but in the exponent, it's e^{-i 3\u03c0/4}, so it's cos(3\u03c0/4) - i sin(3\u03c0/4), which is the same as cos(3\u03c0/4) + i (-sin(3\u03c0/4)).\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for (1 - i)^13. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, earlier, I said that (1 - i)^13 has angle -13\u03c0/4, which we converted to 3\u03c0/4 by adding 4\u03c0 (since -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4). So, e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i 3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) - i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) - i (\u221a2/2). So, yeah, the same as (1+i)^13 but with the same angle.\n\nWait, but when I compute (1 - i)^13, it's (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = 64 sqrt(2) e^{-i 3\u03c0/4} = 64 sqrt(2) [ cos(3\u03c0/4) - i sin(3\u03c0/4) ].\n\nWhich is 64 sqrt(2) [ (-\u221a2/2) - i (\u221a2/2) ] = 64 sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) + 64 sqrt(2) * (-\u221a2/2) i\n\nWhich is 64*(-1) + 64*(-1)i = -64 -64i. So, (1 - i)^13 is also -64 -64i? That can't be right, because (1+i) and (1-i) are conjugates, so their 13th powers should be conjugates as well.\n\nWait, hold on, (1+i)^13 is -64 -64i, so (1 - i)^13 should be the conjugate, which is -64 +64i. But according to the calculation above, I got -64 -64i. That's a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's recast the angle correctly. For (1 - i)^13, the angle is -13\u03c0/4. Let's compute that:\n\n-13\u03c0/4 is the same as 2\u03c0 - 13\u03c0/4 = (8\u03c0 - 13\u03c0)/4 = (-5\u03c0)/4. But that's still negative. Alternatively, add 2\u03c0: -13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 8\u03c0)/4 = (-5\u03c0)/4. Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, add 4\u03c0: -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So, e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i 3\u03c0/4}, because angles are modulo 2\u03c0.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because e^{-i\u03b8} = e^{i(-\u03b8)}, so e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i (-13\u03c0/4)}. But -13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 3\u03c0/4 when adding 4\u03c0 (since -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4). So, e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i 3\u03c0/4}.\n\nWait, that means (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i 3\u03c0/4} = 64 sqrt(2) [ cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) ] = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-\u221a2/2) + i (\u221a2/2) ] = 64*(-1) + 64i. So, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So I must have messed up the sign in the previous step. So, (1+i)^13 is -64 -64i, and (1 - i)^13 is -64 +64i.\n\nSo, now, let's compute (1+i)^13 -1 and (1 - i)^13 -1.\n\n(1+i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i\n\n(1 -i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i\n\nSo, the product is (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i). That's a product of complex conjugates, so it's equal to (-65)^2 + (64)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(-65)^2 = 4225\n\n64^2 = 4096\n\nSo, 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nBut wait, that was the product after the denominators canceled. So, the original product is 8321. But wait, let me check my earlier steps again because I might have missed something.\n\nWait, no: I had Product = [ (1+i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1-i)^13 -1 ] / (i*(-i)) which is equal to [ (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) ] / 1 = (65^2 + 64^2) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. Now, I need to compute 8321 mod 1000.\n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 = 8000, 8321 - 8000 = 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation.\n\nLet me recompute (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13.\n\n(1+i) is sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}, so (1+i)^13 is (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i 13\u03c0/4}.\n\n13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is equivalent to \u03c0/4 in the third revolution. So, 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So, e^{i 5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-\u221a2/2) - i\u221a2/2.\n\nMultiply by (sqrt(2))^13 = (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{6.5} = 64 * sqrt(2). So,\n\n(1+i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * ( (-\u221a2/2) - i\u221a2/2 ) = 64 sqrt(2)*(-\u221a2/2) + 64 sqrt(2)*(-i\u221a2/2)\n\nCompute 64 sqrt(2)*(-\u221a2/2): sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2, so 64*(2)/2*(-1) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 sqrt(2)*(-\u221a2/2) i = -64i.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 = -64 -64i. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = 64 sqrt(2) e^{-i (13\u03c0/4)}. 13\u03c0/4 is 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, so e^{-i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)} = e^{-i \u03c0/4} e^{-i 3\u03c0} = e^{-i \u03c0/4} (-1)^3 = e^{-i \u03c0/4} (-1).\n\nBut e^{-i \u03c0/4} is cos(\u03c0/4) - i sin(\u03c0/4) = \u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * (-1) * (\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2 ) = 64 sqrt(2)*(-1) * (\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2 )\n\nCompute 64 sqrt(2)*(-1)*(\u221a2/2): 64*(-1)*(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1)*(2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nImaginary part: 64 sqrt(2)*(-1)*(-i\u221a2/2) = 64 sqrt(2)*i sqrt(2)/2 = 64*(2)/2 i = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 -i)^13 = -64 +64i. Correct.\n\nSo, (1+i)^13 -1 = -65 -64i, (1 -i)^13 -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nMultiply them: (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(i^2). Wait, wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.\n\nIt's a product of (a + b)(a - b) where a = -65, b = -64i. So, it's a^2 - b^2.\n\na^2 = (-65)^2 = 4225.\n\nb^2 = (-64i)^2 = (-64)^2 * i^2 = 4096*(-1) = -4096.\n\nSo, a^2 - b^2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Correct.\n\nSo, the product is 8321. 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 + 321, so the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check if I considered all the steps correctly. Did I miss any step where I might have miscalculated?\n\nAnother way to think about it: since the product is 8321, which is 8321 mod 1000. 8321 divided by 1000 is 8, remainder 321. So, the remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that my initial steps were correct. I started by noting that the product is \u220f_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) which I transformed into \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1+i) * \u03a6\u2081\u2083(1-i). Then, using the fact that \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = (x\u00b9\u00b3 -1)/(x -1), I substituted x=1+i and x=1-i, computed their products, and ended up with 8321.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I could have approached this problem by considering the minimal polynomials or using other properties of roots of unity, but I think the method I used is solid.\n\nSo, I think the remainder is 321 when the product is divided by 1000.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) is a 13th root of unity.\n\n1. **Identify the Polynomial**: Recognize that each term \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\) can be rewritten as \\(f(\\omega^k)\\) where \\(f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\\). The roots of \\(f(x)\\) are \\(1 \\pm i\\).\n\n2. **Express the Product**: The product becomes \\(\\prod_{k=1}^{12} ( \\omega^k - (1+i) ) \\cdot \\prod_{k=1}^{12} ( \\omega^k - (1-i) )\\), since the term for \\(k=0\\) is 1 and doesn't affect the product.\n\n3. **Use Cyclotomic Polynomial**: The product over primitive 13th roots of unity \\(\\omega^k\\) for \\(k=1\\) to \\(12\\) is given by the cyclotomic polynomial \\(\\Phi_{13}(x)\\). Thus, the product is \\(\\Phi_{13}(1+i) \\cdot \\Phi_{13}(1-i)\\).\n\n4. **Evaluate Cyclotomic Polynomial**: Using \\(\\Phi_{13}(x) = \\frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1}\\), substitute \\(x = 1+i\\) and \\(x = 1-i\\). After simplifying, we find \\(\\Phi_{13}(1+i) = \\frac{(1+i)^{13} - 1}{i}\\) and \\(\\Phi_{13}(1-i) = \\frac{(1-i)^{13} - 1}{-i}\\).\n\n5. **Compute Powers**: Convert \\(1+i\\) and \\(1-i\\) to polar form and compute their 13th powers. We find \\((1+i)^{13} = -64 - 64i\\) and \\((1-i)^{13} = -64 + 64i\\).\n\n6. **Calculate the Product**: Subtract 1 from each result and multiply: \\((-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321\\).\n\n7. **Find the Remainder**: Compute \\(8321 \\mod 1000\\), which gives a remainder of 321.\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{321}\\)",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000.\n\nHmm, okay. So \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, right? Because it's a 13th root and not equal to 1. So that means \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k \u2260 1 for k from 1 to 12.\n\nThe product is over k from 0 to 12, which are all the 13th roots of unity, including 1 when k=0 because \u03c9^0 = 1. So each term in the product is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}.\n\nI need to compute this product and then find its remainder when divided by 1000.\n\nLet me write down the product:\n\nP = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nHmm, that's quite a product. Since \u03c9 is a root of unity, maybe I can use some properties of cyclotomic polynomials or roots of unity to simplify this.\n\nFirst, let's note that \u03c9^k for k=0 to 12 are all distinct 13th roots of unity. So the product is over all 13th roots of unity. Maybe I can relate this to a polynomial whose roots are these terms.\n\nWait, each term is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me denote z_k = 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. So the product is \u220f_{k=0}^{12} z_k.\n\nI wonder if I can express this as a product over a polynomial evaluated at certain points. Alternatively, maybe I can factor the expression 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}.\n\nLet me think about \u03c9^{2k}. Since \u03c9 is a 13th root, \u03c9^{2k} is another root, specifically, it's \u03c9^{2k mod 13}.\n\nWait, perhaps I can rewrite 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me set x = \u03c9^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. So each term is x^2 - 2x + 2.\n\nSo each term is a quadratic in x, where x is a 13th root of unity. So for each x = \u03c9^k, we have a term (x^2 - 2x + 2). So the product becomes \u220f_{x^13=1} (x^2 - 2x + 2).\n\nWait, so the product is the product of (x^2 - 2x + 2) for all x such that x^13 = 1.\n\nHmm, that's a product over all 13th roots of unity of the quadratic polynomial x^2 - 2x + 2.\n\nI remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product over all roots x of unity of f(x) can sometimes be related to cyclotomic polynomials. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product of f(x) over all x where x^n = 1 is equal to the resultant or something similar.\n\nWait, more precisely, for a given polynomial f(x), the product of f(x) over all x with x^n = 1 is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^n - 1. Or perhaps it's the product of f(x) evaluated at each root of x^n - 1.\n\nAlternatively, I think that the product over all x where x^n=1 of f(x) can be found by taking the resultant of f(x) and x^n - 1.\n\nBut maybe that's getting too complicated. Let me think differently.\n\nSince x^13 = 1, x \u2260 1, but in our product, we include x=1 as well because when k=0, x=\u03c9^0=1. So the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including 1.\n\nSo the product is \u220f_{x^13=1} (x^2 - 2x + 2).\n\nI recall that for a polynomial f(x), the product over all roots of unity of f(x) is equal to the product of f(\u03b6) where \u03b6 runs through all n-th roots of unity. This can be related to the value of the polynomial at certain points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product is equal to the product of f(\u03b6) for \u03b6 in the roots of x^13 - 1 = 0.\n\nHmm, but how to compute that product?\n\nWait, another approach: for a polynomial f(x), the product over all roots \u03b6 of x^n - 1 of f(\u03b6) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^n - 1.\n\nBut I'm not too familiar with resultants. Maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, I also remember that the product of (x - \u03b6) over all \u03b6 with \u03b6^n = 1 is equal to x^n - 1. But in our case, it's the product of f(\u03b6) where f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2.\n\nSo perhaps the product is equal to the product over all \u03b6 of (\u03b6^2 - 2\u03b6 + 2).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the polynomial f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Then the product over all \u03b6 of f(\u03b6) is the same as the product of f evaluated at each \u03b6, which are the 13th roots of unity.\n\nI think there is a formula for the product of f(\u03b6) over all \u03b6 with \u03b6^n = 1, which is given by the resultant of f(x) and x^n - 1. The resultant can be computed as the product of f(x) evaluated at the roots of x^n -1, which is exactly our product.\n\nBut I don't remember the exact formula for the resultant. Maybe I can compute it another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use logarithms or something else to compute the product, but that might not be helpful.\n\nWait, another thought: Let me consider the polynomial P(x) = x^13 - 1. Its roots are all the 13th roots of unity. So, if I can relate the product of f(\u03b6) to some other polynomial, maybe I can find the value.\n\nWait, perhaps we can consider that the product over all \u03b6 of (x - \u03b6) is x^13 - 1. So, if we plug in x = something, maybe we can get our product.\n\nWait, but in our case, the product is over (\u03b6^2 - 2\u03b6 + 2). Let me think of this as f(\u03b6) = \u03b6^2 - 2\u03b6 + 2.\n\nSo, the product is \u220f_{\u03b6} f(\u03b6). Hmm.\n\nI remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over primitive roots can be expressed as cyclotomic polynomials, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write f(x) as (x - a)(x - b), where a and b are roots of f(x)=0.\n\nLet me factor f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo f(x) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, the product \u220f_{\u03b6} f(\u03b6) = \u220f_{\u03b6} (\u03b6 - (1 + i))(\u03b6 - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich is equal to \u220f_{\u03b6} (\u03b6 - (1 + i)) multiplied by \u220f_{\u03b6} (\u03b6 - (1 - i)).\n\nBut since \u03b6 runs over all 13th roots of unity, each of these products is the product of (\u03b6 - \u03b1) for \u03b1 being 1 + i and 1 - i.\n\nWait, but the product over all \u03b6 of (\u03b6 - \u03b1) is equal to \u03b1^13 - 1, because the product is (\u03b1^13 - 1), since the roots of x^13 - 1 are the \u03b6's.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. For a polynomial P(x) = x^n - 1, the product over its roots \u03b6 is P(\u03b1) = \u03b1^n - 1. Because P(\u03b1) = (\u03b1 - \u03b6_1)(\u03b1 - \u03b6_2)...(\u03b1 - \u03b6_n).\n\nSo yes, the product over all \u03b6 (\u03b6 - \u03b1) is equal to \u03b1^n - 1.\n\nTherefore, \u220f_{\u03b6} (\u03b6 - \u03b1) = \u03b1^13 - 1.\n\nSo, in our case, \u220f_{\u03b6} (\u03b6 - (1 + i)) = (1 + i)^13 - 1, and similarly for (1 - i).\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nProduct = [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1].\n\nSo, P = [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1].\n\nNow, I need to compute this product.\n\nFirst, let me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{-i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, let's compute (1 + i)^13:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first.\n\nsqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponents e^{i *13 * \u03c0/4} and e^{-i *13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute 13 * \u03c0/4. Since 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4.\n\nBut since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, let's subtract 2\u03c0 until we get an angle between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\n13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = (12 + 1) * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4.\n\nBut 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so subtracting 2\u03c0 gives 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, -13\u03c0/4 = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 gives -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = \u03c0 - \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i *3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * (-i (2)/2 ) = 64 * (-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nCompute this:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 ) = same as before, -64.\n\nImaginary part:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * (i * 2 / 2 ) = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nNow, let's compute [(1 + i)^13 - 1] and [(1 - i)^13 - 1].\n\n(1 + i)^13 - 1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\n(1 - i)^13 - 1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).\n\nThis is of the form (a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2.\n\nHere, a = -65, b = 64i.\n\nWait, no, actually, (a - b)(a + b) is a^2 - b^2.\n\nBut in this case, the terms are (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).\n\nLet me compute it step by step.\n\nMultiply (-65 -64i) and (-65 +64i):\n\nFirst, multiply -65 by -65: 4225.\n\nThen, -65 * 64i = -4160i.\n\nThen, -64i * -65 = +4160i.\n\nFinally, -64i *64i = -4096 i^2 = -4096 (-1) = +4096.\n\nSo, adding all terms:\n\n4225 -4160i +4160i +4096.\n\nThe imaginary parts cancel: (-4160i +4160i)=0.\n\nSo, 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product P is 8321.\n\nWait, but that's just the product of the two terms. So P = 8321.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) using the formula (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, where a is -65 and b is 64i.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = (-65)^2 = 4225.\n\nb\u00b2 = (64i)^2 = 4096 i\u00b2 = -4096.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product P is 8321.\n\nBut wait, the original product was from k=0 to 12, so that's 13 terms, right? But in our calculation, we considered all 13th roots of unity, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, but in the product, when k=0, we have \u03c9^0 =1, so that term is included. So, the calculation is correct because we included all 13th roots.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nBut the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321.\n\nSo, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me verify that.\n\nCompute 8321 /1000 = 8.321, so 8*1000 =8000, 8321-8000=321.\n\nYes, so the remainder is 321.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all steps because I'm a bit nervous.\n\nFirst, I expressed each term as x^2 -2x +2, where x is \u03c9^k. Then, the product over all x^13=1 of (x^2 -2x +2) is equal to the product over all \u03b6 of (\u03b6^2 -2\u03b6 +2), which I wrote as f(\u03b6) where f(x)=x\u00b2-2x+2.\n\nThen, I factored f(x) as (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)), so the product becomes [product over \u03b6 of (\u03b6 - (1+i))] multiplied by [product over \u03b6 of (\u03b6 - (1-i))].\n\nEach product is equal to (1+i)^13 -1 and (1-i)^13 -1, respectively.\n\nI computed (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13 using polar form, which gave me (-64 -64i) and (-64 +64i), respectively.\n\nSubtracting 1 from each gave me (-65 -64i) and (-65 +64i). Multiplying these together gave me 8321.\n\nTaking 8321 mod 1000 gives 321.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check the computation of (1 + i)^13.\n\n(1 + i)^1 = 1 + i.\n\n(1 + i)^2 = 2i.\n\n(1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4.\n\n(1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.\n\n(1 + i)^12 = (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i)^4 = 16*(-4) = -64.\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^12 * (1 + i) = (-64)(1 + i) = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (1 - i)^12 * (1 - i) = (-64)(1 - i) = -64 +64i.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, P = [(-64 -64i) -1] * [(-64 +64i) -1] = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = 8321.\n\nSo, 8321 mod 1000 is indeed 321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning \u03c9^13 = 1 and \u03c9^k \u2260 1 for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 12.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000.\n\nHmm, okay. So \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, right? Because it's a 13th root and not equal to 1. So that means \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k \u2260 1 for k from 1 to 12.\n\nThe product is over k from 0 to 12, which are all the 13th roots of unity, including 1 when k=0 because \u03c9^0 = 1. So each term in the product is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}.\n\nI need to compute this product and then find its remainder when divided by 1000.\n\nLet me write down the product:\n\nP = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nHmm, that's quite a product. Since \u03c9 is a root of unity, maybe I can use some properties of cyclotomic polynomials or roots of unity to simplify this.\n\nFirst, let's note that \u03c9^k for k=0 to 12 are all distinct 13th roots of unity. So the product is over all 13th roots of unity. Maybe I can relate this to a polynomial whose roots are these terms.\n\nWait, each term is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me denote z_k = 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. So the product is \u220f_{k=0}^{12} z_k.\n\nI wonder if I can express this as a product over a polynomial evaluated at certain points. Alternatively, maybe I can factor the expression 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}.\n\nLet me think about \u03c9^{2k}. Since \u03c9 is a 13th root, \u03c9^{2k} is another root, specifically, it's \u03c9^{2k mod 13}.\n\nWait, perhaps I can rewrite 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me set x = \u03c9^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. So each term is x^2 - 2x + 2.\n\nSo each term is a quadratic in x, where x is a 13th root of unity. So for each x = \u03c9^k, we have a term (x^2 - 2x + 2). So the product becomes \u220f_{x^13=1} (x^2 - 2x + 2).\n\nWait, so the product is the product of (x^2 - 2x + 2) for all x such that x^13 = 1.\n\nHmm, that's a product over all 13th roots of unity of the quadratic polynomial x^2 - 2x + 2.\n\nI remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product over all roots x of unity of f(x) can sometimes be related to cyclotomic polynomials. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product of f(x) over all x where x^n = 1 is equal to the resultant or something similar.\n\nWait, more precisely, for a given polynomial f(x), the product of f(x) over all x with x^n = 1 is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^n - 1. Or perhaps it's the product of f(x) evaluated at each root of x^n - 1.\n\nAlternatively, I think that the product over all x where x^n=1 of f(x) can be found by taking the resultant of f(x) and x^n - 1.\n\nBut maybe that's getting too complicated. Let me think differently.\n\nSince x^13 = 1, x \u2260 1, but in our product, we include x=1 as well because when k=0, x=\u03c9^0=1. So the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including 1.\n\nSo the product is \u220f_{x^13=1} (x^2 - 2x + 2).\n\nI recall that for a polynomial f(x), the product over all roots of unity of f(x) is equal to the product of f(\u03b6) where \u03b6 runs through all n-th roots of unity. This can be related to the value of the polynomial at certain points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product is equal to the product of f(\u03b6) for \u03b6 in the roots of x^13 - 1 = 0.\n\nHmm, but how to compute that product?\n\nWait, another approach: for a polynomial f(x), the product over all roots \u03b6 of x^n - 1 of f(\u03b6) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^n - 1.\n\nBut I'm not too familiar with resultants. Maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, I also remember that the product of (x - \u03b6) over all \u03b6 with \u03b6^n = 1 is equal to x^n - 1. But in our case, it's the product of f(\u03b6) where f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2.\n\nSo perhaps the product is equal to the product over all \u03b6 of (\u03b6^2 - 2\u03b6 + 2).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the polynomial f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Then the product over all \u03b6 of f(\u03b6) is the same as the product of f evaluated at each \u03b6, which are the 13th roots of unity.\n\nI think there is a formula for the product of f(\u03b6) over all \u03b6 with \u03b6^n = 1, which is given by the resultant of f(x) and x^n - 1. The resultant can be computed as the product of f(x) evaluated at the roots of x^n -1, which is exactly our product.\n\nBut I don't remember the exact formula for the resultant. Maybe I can compute it another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use logarithms or something else to compute the product, but that might not be helpful.\n\nWait, another thought: Let me consider the polynomial P(x) = x^13 - 1. Its roots are all the 13th roots of unity. So, if I can relate the product of f(\u03b6) to some other polynomial, maybe I can find the value.\n\nWait, perhaps we can consider that the product over all \u03b6 of (x - \u03b6) is x^13 - 1. So, if we plug in x = something, maybe we can get our product.\n\nWait, but in our case, the product is over (\u03b6^2 - 2\u03b6 + 2). Let me think of this as f(\u03b6) = \u03b6^2 - 2\u03b6 + 2.\n\nSo, the product is \u220f_{\u03b6} f(\u03b6). Hmm.\n\nI remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over primitive roots can be expressed as cyclotomic polynomials, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write f(x) as (x - a)(x - b), where a and b are roots of f(x)=0.\n\nLet me factor f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo f(x) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, the product \u220f_{\u03b6} f(\u03b6) = \u220f_{\u03b6} (\u03b6 - (1 + i))(\u03b6 - (1 - i)).\n\nWhich is equal to \u220f_{\u03b6} (\u03b6 - (1 + i)) multiplied by \u220f_{\u03b6} (\u03b6 - (1 - i)).\n\nBut since \u03b6 runs over all 13th roots of unity, each of these products is the product of (\u03b6 - \u03b1) for \u03b1 being 1 + i and 1 - i.\n\nWait, but the product over all \u03b6 of (\u03b6 - \u03b1) is equal to \u03b1^13 - 1, because the product is (\u03b1^13 - 1), since the roots of x^13 - 1 are the \u03b6's.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. For a polynomial P(x) = x^n - 1, the product over its roots \u03b6 is P(\u03b1) = \u03b1^n - 1. Because P(\u03b1) = (\u03b1 - \u03b6_1)(\u03b1 - \u03b6_2)...(\u03b1 - \u03b6_n).\n\nSo yes, the product over all \u03b6 (\u03b6 - \u03b1) is equal to \u03b1^n - 1.\n\nTherefore, \u220f_{\u03b6} (\u03b6 - \u03b1) = \u03b1^13 - 1.\n\nSo, in our case, \u220f_{\u03b6} (\u03b6 - (1 + i)) = (1 + i)^13 - 1, and similarly for (1 - i).\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nProduct = [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1].\n\nSo, P = [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1].\n\nNow, I need to compute this product.\n\nFirst, let me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nI know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{-i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, let's compute (1 + i)^13:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first.\n\nsqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow, the exponents e^{i *13 * \u03c0/4} and e^{-i *13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute 13 * \u03c0/4. Since 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4.\n\nBut since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, let's subtract 2\u03c0 until we get an angle between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\n13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = -13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n13 * \u03c0/4 = (12 + 1) * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4.\n\nBut 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so subtracting 2\u03c0 gives 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, -13\u03c0/4 = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 gives -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = \u03c0 - \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nSo, e^{i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i *5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i *13\u03c0/4} = e^{i *3\u03c0/4} = cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * (-i (2)/2 ) = 64 * (-i) = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nCompute this:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 ) = same as before, -64.\n\nImaginary part:\n\n64 sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * (i * 2 / 2 ) = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nNow, let's compute [(1 + i)^13 - 1] and [(1 - i)^13 - 1].\n\n(1 + i)^13 - 1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\n(1 - i)^13 - 1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).\n\nThis is of the form (a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2.\n\nHere, a = -65, b = 64i.\n\nWait, no, actually, (a - b)(a + b) is a^2 - b^2.\n\nBut in this case, the terms are (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).\n\nLet me compute it step by step.\n\nMultiply (-65 -64i) and (-65 +64i):\n\nFirst, multiply -65 by -65: 4225.\n\nThen, -65 * 64i = -4160i.\n\nThen, -64i * -65 = +4160i.\n\nFinally, -64i *64i = -4096 i^2 = -4096 (-1) = +4096.\n\nSo, adding all terms:\n\n4225 -4160i +4160i +4096.\n\nThe imaginary parts cancel: (-4160i +4160i)=0.\n\nSo, 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product P is 8321.\n\nWait, but that's just the product of the two terms. So P = 8321.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) using the formula (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, where a is -65 and b is 64i.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = (-65)^2 = 4225.\n\nb\u00b2 = (64i)^2 = 4096 i\u00b2 = -4096.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product P is 8321.\n\nBut wait, the original product was from k=0 to 12, so that's 13 terms, right? But in our calculation, we considered all 13th roots of unity, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, but in the product, when k=0, we have \u03c9^0 =1, so that term is included. So, the calculation is correct because we included all 13th roots.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nBut the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000.\n\nSo, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321.\n\nSo, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nWait, but let me verify that.\n\nCompute 8321 /1000 = 8.321, so 8*1000 =8000, 8321-8000=321.\n\nYes, so the remainder is 321.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 321.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all steps because I'm a bit nervous.\n\nFirst, I expressed each term as x^2 -2x +2, where x is \u03c9^k. Then, the product over all x^13=1 of (x^2 -2x +2) is equal to the product over all \u03b6 of (\u03b6^2 -2\u03b6 +2), which I wrote as f(\u03b6) where f(x)=x\u00b2-2x+2.\n\nThen, I factored f(x) as (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)), so the product becomes [product over \u03b6 of (\u03b6 - (1+i))] multiplied by [product over \u03b6 of (\u03b6 - (1-i))].\n\nEach product is equal to (1+i)^13 -1 and (1-i)^13 -1, respectively.\n\nI computed (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13 using polar form, which gave me (-64 -64i) and (-64 +64i), respectively.\n\nSubtracting 1 from each gave me (-65 -64i) and (-65 +64i). Multiplying these together gave me 8321.\n\nTaking 8321 mod 1000 gives 321.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check the computation of (1 + i)^13.\n\n(1 + i)^1 = 1 + i.\n\n(1 + i)^2 = 2i.\n\n(1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4.\n\n(1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.\n\n(1 + i)^12 = (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i)^4 = 16*(-4) = -64.\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^12 * (1 + i) = (-64)(1 + i) = -64 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (1 - i)^12 * (1 - i) = (-64)(1 - i) = -64 +64i.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, P = [(-64 -64i) -1] * [(-64 +64i) -1] = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = 8321.\n\nSo, 8321 mod 1000 is indeed 321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning \u03c9^13 = 1 and \u03c9^k \u2260 1 for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 12. The given product is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}).\n\\]\n\nEach term can be rewritten as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let x = \u03c9^k, then the term becomes:\n\n\\[\n2 - 2x + x^2 = x^2 - 2x + 2.\n\\]\n\nThus, the product becomes:\n\n\\[\nP = \\prod_{x^{13}=1} (x^2 - 2x + 2),\n\\]\n\nwhere the product is over all 13th roots of unity x. Factoring the quadratic polynomial, we have:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)),\n\\]\n\nwhere 1 \u00b1 i are the roots. Therefore, the product can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nP = \\left( \\prod_{x^{13}=1} (x - (1 + i)) \\right) \\left( \\prod_{x^{13}=1} (x - (1 - i)) \\right).\n\\]\n\nEach product is the evaluation of the polynomial x^13 - 1 at x = 1 \u00b1 i. Hence:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{x^{13}=1} (x - (1 + i)) = (1 + i)^{13} - 1,\n\\]\n\\[\n\\prod_{x^{13}=1} (x - (1 - i)) = (1 - i)^{13} - 1.\n\\]\n\nCalculating (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 using polar form:\n\n- (1 + i) has modulus \u221a2 and argument \u03c0/4, so (1 + i)^13 = (\u221a2)^13 e^{i\u00b713\u03c0/4} = 64\u221a2 (cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)) = -64 - 64i.\n- Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nSubtracting 1 from each:\n\n\\[\n(1 + i)^{13} - 1 = -65 - 64i,\n\\]\n\\[\n(1 - i)^{13} - 1 = -65 + 64i.\n\\]\n\nThe product is:\n\n\\[\n(-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\\]\n\nFinally, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is:\n\n\\[\n8321 \\mod 1000 = 321.\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{321}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem is: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000.\n\nHmm, okay. So, first, \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, right? Because it's a 13th root and \u03c9 \u2260 1. So, \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k \u2260 1 for any k from 1 to 12.\n\nThe product is over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). That looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can find a way to simplify it.\n\nI remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when dealing with cyclotomic polynomials. The minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure yet how that would help here.\n\nLet me write down the product:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\n\nI need to compute this product. Maybe I can factor each term or find a pattern.\n\nLooking at each term: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me see if I can write this as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me let z = \u03c9^k, so each term becomes 2 - 2z + z\u00b2.\n\nSo, each term is z\u00b2 - 2z + 2. That's a quadratic in z. Hmm, can I factor this? Let me compute its discriminant: D = 4 - 8 = -4. So, the roots are [2 \u00b1 i\u221a4]/2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, z\u00b2 - 2z + 2 = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). \n\nSo, each term is (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)) where z = \u03c9^k. So, the product becomes:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, this is the same as [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nNow, I know that the product over k=0 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) is equal to x^13 - 1, since the roots of x^13 - 1 are exactly the 13th roots of unity. But wait, in our case, the products are over (\u03c9^k - a), where a is (1 + i) or (1 - i). So, can I write that as (-1)^13 times the product of (a - \u03c9^k)?\n\nYes, because (\u03c9^k - a) = -(a - \u03c9^k). So, the product becomes:\n\n[(-1)^13 * \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 + i) - \u03c9^k ) ] * [ (-1)^13 * \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 - i) - \u03c9^k ) ]\n\nSince (-1)^13 = -1, so each product becomes -1 times the product of ( (1 \u00b1 i) - \u03c9^k ). So, the entire product is (-1)^2 * [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 + i) - \u03c9^k ) ] * [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 - i) - \u03c9^k ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to 1 * [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nWait, no, because \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1. So, if we set x = (1 + i), then \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 + i) - \u03c9^k ) = (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly for (1 - i).\n\nTherefore, the product becomes:\n\n[ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ]\n\nSo, our original product is equal to [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nSo, I need to compute this expression and then find the remainder when it's divided by 1000.\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 first.\n\nI remember that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents. 13\u03c0/4 can be simplified by subtracting multiples of 2\u03c0.\n\n13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so let's subtract 2\u03c0 once: 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nMultiply that out: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (2)/2 ) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-i * 2)/2 = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nCompute that: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nImaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * i * (2)/2 = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Because when I computed (1 + i)^13, I got -64 -64i, and (1 - i)^13 should be the conjugate, which would be -64 +64i. That makes sense.\n\nSo now, we have:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i\n\n(1 - i)^13 = -64 +64i\n\nSo, the product becomes:\n\n[ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] = [ (-64 -64i) - 1 ] * [ (-64 +64i) -1 ].\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSecond term: (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nCompute that: (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, let me compute that again. Because (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2.\n\n(-65)^2 is 4225. (64i)^2 is (64)^2 * i^2 = 4096 * (-1) = -4096.\n\nSo, 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, I think I messed up a step. Let me go back.\n\nWe had:\n\nProduct = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nWhich became [ (-64 -64i) -1 ] * [ (-64 +64i) -1 ].\n\nSo, that's (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i). Now, when you multiply two complex numbers, (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, but wait, that's if they are conjugates.\n\nWait, in this case, the first term is (-65 -64i), and the second is (-65 +64i). So, they are conjugates, because the real parts are the same, and the imaginary parts are negatives.\n\nSo, their product is (-65)^2 + (64)^2.\n\nWait, because (a + bi)(a - bi) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.\n\nWait, (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 only if b is a real number. But here, the terms are complex. Let me compute it step by step.\n\nMultiply (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i):\n\n= (-65)*(-65) + (-65)*(64i) + (-64i)*(-65) + (-64i)*(64i)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 4225\n\nSecond term: -65*64i = -4160i\n\nThird term: -64i*(-65) = 4160i\n\nFourth term: (-64i)*(64i) = (-64)(64)(i^2) = (-4096)(-1) = 4096.\n\nSo, sum all terms:\n\n4225 -4160i +4160i +4096.\n\nThe -4160i and +4160i cancel each other out, leaving 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the product is 8321.\n\nSo, the original product is 8321.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000.\n\nSo, compute 8321 mod 1000.\n\nWell, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321.\n\nBecause 8*1000=8000, and 8321 -8000=321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that. 1000*8=8000, 8000 + 321=8321. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 321.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check all steps because sometimes in these problems, especially with cyclotomic polynomials, there can be a factor that I missed.\n\nWait, earlier, I had the product as [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ].\n\nBut let me recall that the product over (\u03c9^k - a) is equal to a^13 -1, but I had to adjust for the sign.\n\nWait, earlier steps:\n\nProduct_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 * (a^13 -1) = - (a^13 -1).\n\nSo, the product becomes [ - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ].\n\nWhich is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ] = [ - ( -64 -64i -1 ) ] * [ - ( -64 +64i -1 ) ].\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, (1 + i)^13 is -64 -64i, so (1 + i)^13 -1 is (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 is -65 +64i.\n\nSo, [ - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] is - ( -65 -64i ) = 65 +64i.\n\nSimilarly, [ - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ] is - ( -65 +64i ) = 65 -64i.\n\nSo, the product is (65 +64i)(65 -64i).\n\nWhich is 65^2 + 64^2.\n\nCompute that: 65^2 = 4225, 64^2 = 4096. Sum: 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, that's correct. So, the product is indeed 8321, and mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe given problem involves computing the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) is a 13th root of unity.\n\nFirst, we recognize that each term in the product can be expressed as a quadratic in \\(\\omega^k\\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem is: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000.\n\nHmm, okay. So, first, \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, right? Because it's a 13th root and \u03c9 \u2260 1. So, \u03c9^13 = 1, and \u03c9^k \u2260 1 for any k from 1 to 12.\n\nThe product is over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). That looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can find a way to simplify it.\n\nI remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when dealing with cyclotomic polynomials. The minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure yet how that would help here.\n\nLet me write down the product:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\n\nI need to compute this product. Maybe I can factor each term or find a pattern.\n\nLooking at each term: 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Let me see if I can write this as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me let z = \u03c9^k, so each term becomes 2 - 2z + z\u00b2.\n\nSo, each term is z\u00b2 - 2z + 2. That's a quadratic in z. Hmm, can I factor this? Let me compute its discriminant: D = 4 - 8 = -4. So, the roots are [2 \u00b1 i\u221a4]/2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So, z\u00b2 - 2z + 2 = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). \n\nSo, each term is (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)) where z = \u03c9^k. So, the product becomes:\n\nProduct = \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))(\u03c9^k - (1 - i)).\n\nSo, this is the same as [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 + i))] * [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - (1 - i))].\n\nNow, I know that the product over k=0 to 12 of (x - \u03c9^k) is equal to x^13 - 1, since the roots of x^13 - 1 are exactly the 13th roots of unity. But wait, in our case, the products are over (\u03c9^k - a), where a is (1 + i) or (1 - i). So, can I write that as (-1)^13 times the product of (a - \u03c9^k)?\n\nYes, because (\u03c9^k - a) = -(a - \u03c9^k). So, the product becomes:\n\n[(-1)^13 * \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 + i) - \u03c9^k ) ] * [ (-1)^13 * \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 - i) - \u03c9^k ) ]\n\nSince (-1)^13 = -1, so each product becomes -1 times the product of ( (1 \u00b1 i) - \u03c9^k ). So, the entire product is (-1)^2 * [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 + i) - \u03c9^k ) ] * [\u220f_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 - i) - \u03c9^k ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to 1 * [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nWait, no, because \u220f_{k=0}^{12} (x - \u03c9^k) = x^13 - 1. So, if we set x = (1 + i), then \u220f_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 + i) - \u03c9^k ) = (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly for (1 - i).\n\nTherefore, the product becomes:\n\n[ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ]\n\nSo, our original product is equal to [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nSo, I need to compute this expression and then find the remainder when it's divided by 1000.\n\nLet me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 first.\n\nI remember that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) * e^{-i\u03c0/4}.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * \u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nNow, let's compute the exponents. 13\u03c0/4 can be simplified by subtracting multiples of 2\u03c0.\n\n13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. But 3\u03c0 is more than 2\u03c0, so let's subtract 2\u03c0 once: 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4.\n\nSimilarly, e^{i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i * 13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i * 5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nMultiply that out: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (2)/2 ) = 64 * (-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-i * 2)/2 = -64i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nCompute that: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nImaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * i * (2)/2 = 64i.\n\nSo, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Because when I computed (1 + i)^13, I got -64 -64i, and (1 - i)^13 should be the conjugate, which would be -64 +64i. That makes sense.\n\nSo now, we have:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i\n\n(1 - i)^13 = -64 +64i\n\nSo, the product becomes:\n\n[ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] = [ (-64 -64i) - 1 ] * [ (-64 +64i) -1 ].\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSecond term: (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is equal to the square of the modulus.\n\nCompute that: (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, let me compute that again. Because (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2.\n\n(-65)^2 is 4225. (64i)^2 is (64)^2 * i^2 = 4096 * (-1) = -4096.\n\nSo, 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, the product is 8321.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, I think I messed up a step. Let me go back.\n\nWe had:\n\nProduct = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].\n\nWhich became [ (-64 -64i) -1 ] * [ (-64 +64i) -1 ].\n\nSo, that's (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i). Now, when you multiply two complex numbers, (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, but wait, that's if they are conjugates.\n\nWait, in this case, the first term is (-65 -64i), and the second is (-65 +64i). So, they are conjugates, because the real parts are the same, and the imaginary parts are negatives.\n\nSo, their product is (-65)^2 + (64)^2.\n\nWait, because (a + bi)(a - bi) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.\n\nWait, (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 only if b is a real number. But here, the terms are complex. Let me compute it step by step.\n\nMultiply (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i):\n\n= (-65)*(-65) + (-65)*(64i) + (-64i)*(-65) + (-64i)*(64i)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 4225\n\nSecond term: -65*64i = -4160i\n\nThird term: -64i*(-65) = 4160i\n\nFourth term: (-64i)*(64i) = (-64)(64)(i^2) = (-4096)(-1) = 4096.\n\nSo, sum all terms:\n\n4225 -4160i +4160i +4096.\n\nThe -4160i and +4160i cancel each other out, leaving 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the product is 8321.\n\nSo, the original product is 8321.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000.\n\nSo, compute 8321 mod 1000.\n\nWell, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321.\n\nBecause 8*1000=8000, and 8321 -8000=321.\n\nSo, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that. 1000*8=8000, 8000 + 321=8321. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 321.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check all steps because sometimes in these problems, especially with cyclotomic polynomials, there can be a factor that I missed.\n\nWait, earlier, I had the product as [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ].\n\nBut let me recall that the product over (\u03c9^k - a) is equal to a^13 -1, but I had to adjust for the sign.\n\nWait, earlier steps:\n\nProduct_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^k - a) = (-1)^13 * (a^13 -1) = - (a^13 -1).\n\nSo, the product becomes [ - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ].\n\nWhich is [ - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ] = [ - ( -64 -64i -1 ) ] * [ - ( -64 +64i -1 ) ].\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, (1 + i)^13 is -64 -64i, so (1 + i)^13 -1 is (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 is -65 +64i.\n\nSo, [ - ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) ] is - ( -65 -64i ) = 65 +64i.\n\nSimilarly, [ - ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ] is - ( -65 +64i ) = 65 -64i.\n\nSo, the product is (65 +64i)(65 -64i).\n\nWhich is 65^2 + 64^2.\n\nCompute that: 65^2 = 4225, 64^2 = 4096. Sum: 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\nSo, that's correct. So, the product is indeed 8321, and mod 1000 is 321.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer.\n\n\nThe given problem involves computing the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) is a 13th root of unity.\n\nFirst, we recognize that each term in the product can be expressed as a quadratic in \\(\\omega^k\\). Letting \\(z = \\omega^k\\), each term becomes \\(z^2 - 2z + 2\\), which factors as \\((z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i))\\). Thus, the product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 + i - \\omega^k) \\cdot \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - i - \\omega^k)\n\\]\n\nUsing the property of roots of unity, we know that \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \\omega^k) = x^{13} - 1\\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 + i - \\omega^k) = (1 + i)^{13} - 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - i - \\omega^k) = (1 - i)^{13} - 1\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\((1 + i)^{13}\\) and \\((1 - i)^{13}\\) using polar forms, we find:\n\n\\[\n(1 + i)^{13} = -64 - 64i \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (1 - i)^{13} = -64 + 64i\n\\]\n\nThus, the product becomes:\n\n\\[\n[(-64 - 64i) - 1] \\cdot [(-64 + 64i) - 1] = (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i)\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321\n\\]\n\nFinally, finding the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 gives:\n\n\\[\n8321 \\mod 1000 = 321\n\\]\n\nThe remainder is \\(\\boxed{321}\\).",
