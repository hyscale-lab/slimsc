      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.\n\nWe have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, point O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere on the y-axis, a bit less than (0,1) because sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.\n\nThe family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ is a line segment from some point P on the x-axis to some point Q on the y-axis, and the length of PQ is 1. All these segments are in the first quadrant, meaning both P and Q have non-negative coordinates.\n\nThere's a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except for AB. So, C is on AB, and it's only on AB and none of the other segments in F. I need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express OC\u00b2 as a reduced fraction p/q and find p + q.\n\nAlright, so to approach this, I think I need to parametrize the segment AB first. Let's figure out the equation of AB.\n\nPoints A and B are at (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2) respectively. So, the line AB goes from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me find the slope of AB.\n\nSlope m = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the slope is -sqrt(3).\n\nNow, the equation of AB can be written using point-slope form. Let's use point A: (1/2, 0).\n\ny - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2)\n=> y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2)\n\nSo, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nNow, any point C on AB can be written as (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, with x between 0 and 1/2.\n\nBut C is a unique point on AB that isn't on any other segment in F except AB. So, I need to find a point C on AB such that there's no other segment PQ in F (other than AB itself) that passes through C.\n\nSo, my task is to find such a point C, then compute OC\u00b2.\n\nTo find C, perhaps I can consider the family F of segments PQ. Each PQ has length 1, with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis. So, for a given P at (p, 0), Q must be at (0, q) such that the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is 1.\n\nSo, sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, which implies p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, for each p between 0 and 1, q is sqrt(1 - p\u00b2), but since we are in the first quadrant, both p and q are positive.\n\nThus, each segment PQ connects (p, 0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)).\n\nSo, the family F consists of all such segments for p in [0,1].\n\nNow, we can think of each segment PQ as a line connecting (p,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)). The equation of such a line can be parameterized or expressed in slope-intercept form.\n\nLet me find the equation of PQ for a general p.\n\nThe slope m of PQ is (sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) - 0)/(0 - p) = -sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p.\n\nSo, the equation is y = (-sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p\u00b2).\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nAt x = p, y = 0, which is correct.\n\nAt x = 0, y = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2), which is correct. So, the equation is correct.\n\nSo, the equation of PQ is y = [ -sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p ] x + sqrt(1 - p\u00b2).\n\nNow, point C is on AB, so its coordinates satisfy y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe need to find a point C on AB such that it doesn't lie on any other PQ from F except AB itself.\n\nWait, but AB is also a segment in F. Let me see: is AB of unit length?\n\nLet me compute the distance from A to B.\n\nPoint A is (1/2, 0), point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). The distance between A and B is sqrt[ (1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2 ] = sqrt[ (1/4) + (3/4) ] = sqrt(1) = 1. Yes, AB is a segment in F.\n\nSo, AB is in F, and point C is on AB, so it's on AB's segment. But C is not on any other segment from F. So, for all other p \u2260 corresponding to A or B, the segment PQ shouldn't pass through C.\n\nWait, let me think. Each PQ is a line segment between (p,0) and (0, q), with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe need to find point C on AB such that no other PQ (other than AB itself) passes through C.\n\nSo, perhaps point C is the only point on AB that is not intersected by any other PQ from F.\n\nAlternatively, point C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F.\n\nWait, the family F is a set of lines PQ. The envelope of these lines might form a curve, and AB is tangent to this envelope at point C.\n\nHmm, that seems plausible. Because if AB is tangent to the envelope, then C is the point of tangency, which is unique.\n\nSo, perhaps I can find the envelope of the family F and then find where AB is tangent to it. The point of tangency would be C.\n\nHow do I find the envelope of a family of curves? The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point.\n\nFor the family of lines given by F, each line is PQ, which we have the equation y = [ -sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p ] x + sqrt(1 - p\u00b2), where p is a parameter between 0 and 1.\n\nTo find the envelope, we can use the method where we solve the system:\n\nF(p, x, y) = y + [sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p] x - sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 0\n\nand\n\ndF/dp = 0.\n\nSo, compute dF/dp and set it to zero.\n\nLet me compute F(p, x, y):\n\nF(p, x, y) = y + (sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p) x - sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 0\n\nSo, F(p, x, y) = y + x * sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p - sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 0\n\nLet me compute dF/dp:\n\ndF/dp = derivative of F with respect to p.\n\nFirst term: derivative of y with respect to p is 0.\n\nSecond term: x * derivative of sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p with respect to p.\n\nThird term: derivative of -sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) with respect to p.\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nLet me denote f(p) = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p.\n\nCompute f'(p):\n\nf(p) = (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2) / p.\n\nUse quotient rule: [ ( (1/2)(1 - p\u00b2)^(-1/2) (-2p) ) * p - (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2) * 1 ] / p\u00b2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n[ (-p (1 - p\u00b2)^(-1/2) ) * p - (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2) ] \n\n= [ -p\u00b2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(-1/2) - (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2) ]\n\nFactor out -(1 - p\u00b2)^(-1/2):\n\n= - (1 - p\u00b2)^(-1/2) [ p\u00b2 + (1 - p\u00b2) ]\n\n= - (1 - p\u00b2)^(-1/2) [ p\u00b2 +1 - p\u00b2 ]\n\n= - (1 - p\u00b2)^(-1/2) (1)\n\n= -1 / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)\n\nSo, f'(p) = [ -1 / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ] / p\u00b2\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check that.\n\nWait, the derivative of sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) is (1/2)(1 - p\u00b2)^(-1/2)*(-2p) = -p / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2).\n\nThen, using the quotient rule for f(p) = numerator / denominator, where numerator = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2), denominator = p.\n\nSo, f'(p) = [ numerator' * denominator - numerator * denominator' ] / denominator^2\n\nSo, numerator' = -p / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)\n\ndenominator = p, denominator' = 1\n\nSo, f'(p) = [ (-p / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)) * p - sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) * 1 ] / p\u00b2\n\n= [ (-p\u00b2 / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)) - sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ] / p\u00b2\n\nFactor out -1/sqrt(1 - p\u00b2):\n\n= [ - (p\u00b2 + (1 - p\u00b2)) / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ] / p\u00b2\n\n= [ - (1) / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ] / p\u00b2\n\n= -1 / [ p\u00b2 sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ]\n\nSo, f'(p) = -1 / [ p\u00b2 sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ]\n\nOkay, so the derivative of the second term is x * f'(p) = -x / [ p\u00b2 sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ]\n\nNow, the third term is -sqrt(1 - p\u00b2). Its derivative is -(1/(2 sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)))(-2p) )= p / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\ndF/dp = 0 + [ -x / (p\u00b2 sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)) ] + [ p / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ] = 0\n\nSo,\n\n- x / (p\u00b2 sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)) + p / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(1 - p\u00b2):\n\n- x / p\u00b2 + p = 0\n\nSo,\n\n- x / p\u00b2 + p = 0\n\n=> p = x / p\u00b2\n\n=> p\u00b3 = x\n\nSo, from this equation, x = p\u00b3.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. F(p, x, y) = 0: y + x * sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p - sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 0\n\n2. dF/dp = 0: p\u00b3 = x\n\nSo, substituting x = p\u00b3 into equation 1:\n\ny + (p\u00b3) * sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p - sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\ny + p\u00b2 sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) - sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 0\n\nFactor sqrt(1 - p\u00b2):\n\ny + sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) (p\u00b2 - 1) = 0\n\nNote that p\u00b2 - 1 = -(1 - p\u00b2), so:\n\ny - sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) (1 - p\u00b2) = 0\n\nSo,\n\ny = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) (1 - p\u00b2)\n\nBut 1 - p\u00b2 = (sqrt(1 - p\u00b2))\u00b2, so:\n\ny = (sqrt(1 - p\u00b2))\u00b3\n\nSo, we have x = p\u00b3 and y = (sqrt(1 - p\u00b2))\u00b3\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nx = p\u00b3\n\ny = (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)\n\nNow, we can try to eliminate the parameter p to find the envelope.\n\nFrom x = p\u00b3, we can write p = x^(1/3)\n\nSubstitute into y:\n\ny = (1 - (x^(1/3))\u00b2 )^(3/2) = (1 - x^(2/3) )^(3/2)\n\nSo, the envelope is y = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2)\n\nLet me see if I can simplify this.\n\nLet me raise both sides to the power of 2/3 to make it easier:\n\ny^(2/3) = (1 - x^(2/3))\n\nSo,\n\ny^(2/3) + x^(2/3) = 1\n\nHmm, that's interesting. It's the equation of an astroid.\n\nYes, the envelope of the family of lines PQ is an astroid given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nSo, the astroid is the envelope of the family F.\n\nNow, we need to find the point C where the line AB is tangent to this astroid.\n\nBecause AB is a member of F, and the envelope is the astroid, AB is tangent to the astroid at point C.\n\nSo, point C is the point of tangency between AB and the astroid.\n\nSo, to find C, we can solve for the intersection of AB and the astroid, and ensure that the tangent to the astroid at that point is the same as AB.\n\nAlternatively, since AB is tangent to the astroid at C, we can find the point where AB touches the astroid and the slope of AB equals the derivative of the astroid at that point.\n\nSo, let's find the point of intersection between AB and the astroid.\n\nAB has equation y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2\n\nThe astroid has equation x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1\n\nSubstitute y from AB into the astroid equation:\n\nx^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) = 1\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated. Let me denote t = x^(1/3), but maybe it's better to let\u2019s set u = x^(2/3) and v = y^(2/3). Then, u + v = 1.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to parametrize the astroid.\n\nThe astroid can be parametrized as:\n\nx = cos^3(theta)\n\ny = sin^3(theta)\n\nfor theta in [0, 2pi)\n\nBut wait, let me confirm.\n\nIf we parametrize as x = cos^3(theta), y = sin^3(theta), then x^(2/3) = cos\u00b2(theta), y^(2/3) = sin\u00b2(theta), so x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = cos\u00b2(theta) + sin\u00b2(theta) = 1. Yes, that works.\n\nSo, parametric equations:\n\nx = cos\u00b3(theta)\n\ny = sin\u00b3(theta)\n\nSo, the astroid is parametrized by theta.\n\nNow, the slope of the tangent to the astroid at theta is given by dy/dx.\n\nCompute dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = (dy/dtheta) / (dx/dtheta)\n\ndy/dtheta = 3 sin\u00b2(theta) cos(theta)\n\ndx/dtheta = -3 cos\u00b2(theta) sin(theta)\n\nSo,\n\ndy/dx = [3 sin\u00b2(theta) cos(theta)] / [ -3 cos\u00b2(theta) sin(theta) ] = - sin(theta) / cos(theta) = -tan(theta)\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent at theta is -tan(theta).\n\nNow, the line AB has slope -sqrt(3). So, to find the point of tangency, set -tan(theta) = -sqrt(3) => tan(theta) = sqrt(3) => theta = pi/3 or 4pi/3.\n\nBut since we are in the first quadrant (the astroid is in the first quadrant, right?), theta should be between 0 and pi/2.\n\nWait, let me think. The astroid is symmetric in all quadrants, but our family F is in the first quadrant, so the envelope is the part of the astroid in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, theta is between 0 and pi/2.\n\nSo, tan(theta) = sqrt(3) => theta = pi/3.\n\nSo, theta = pi/3.\n\nSo, the point of tangency is at theta = pi/3.\n\nCompute x and y:\n\nx = cos\u00b3(pi/3) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8\n\ny = sin\u00b3(pi/3) = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3*sqrt(3))/8\n\nSo, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 )\n\nWait, but let's check if this point lies on AB.\n\nAB has equation y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2\n\nLet me plug x = 1/8 into AB's equation:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8\n\nWhich matches the y-coordinate of the astroid point. So, yes, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 )\n\nWait, but let me confirm: point C is on AB, which goes from A(1/2,0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The point (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ) is on AB because when x=1/8, y=3 sqrt(3)/8, which is consistent with AB's equation.\n\nSo, that's our point C.\n\nNow, compute OC\u00b2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C.\n\nOC\u00b2 = (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^2\n\n= 1/64 + (27)/64\n\n= (1 + 27)/64\n\n= 28/64\n\nSimplify 28/64: divide numerator and denominator by 4, get 7/16.\n\nSo, OC\u00b2 = 7/16.\n\nThus, p =7, q=16, and p + q =23.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculation of OC\u00b2.\n\nx = 1/8, y=3 sqrt(3)/8\n\nx\u00b2 = (1)^2 / (8)^2 = 1/64\n\ny\u00b2 = (3 sqrt(3))^2 / (8)^2 = (9 *3)/64 = 27/64\n\nSum: 1/64 +27/64 =28/64 =7/16.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 7 +16=23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{23}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.\n\nWe have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, point O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere on the y-axis, a bit less than (0,1) because sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.\n\nThe family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ is a line segment from some point P on the x-axis to some point Q on the y-axis, and the length of PQ is 1. All these segments are in the first quadrant, meaning both P and Q have non-negative coordinates.\n\nThere's a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except for AB. So, C is on AB, and it's only on AB and none of the other segments in F. I need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express OC\u00b2 as a reduced fraction p/q and find p + q.\n\nAlright, so to approach this, I think I need to parametrize the segment AB first. Let's figure out the equation of AB.\n\nPoints A and B are at (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2) respectively. So, the line AB goes from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me find the slope of AB.\n\nSlope m = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the slope is -sqrt(3).\n\nNow, the equation of AB can be written using point-slope form. Let's use point A: (1/2, 0).\n\ny - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2)\n=> y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2)\n\nSo, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nNow, any point C on AB can be written as (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, with x between 0 and 1/2.\n\nBut C is a unique point on AB that isn't on any other segment in F except AB. So, I need to find a point C on AB such that there's no other segment PQ in F (other than AB itself) that passes through C.\n\nSo, my task is to find such a point C, then compute OC\u00b2.\n\nTo find C, perhaps I can consider the family F of segments PQ. Each PQ has length 1, with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis. So, for a given P at (p, 0), Q must be at (0, q) such that the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is 1.\n\nSo, sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, which implies p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, for each p between 0 and 1, q is sqrt(1 - p\u00b2), but since we are in the first quadrant, both p and q are positive.\n\nThus, each segment PQ connects (p, 0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)).\n\nSo, the family F consists of all such segments for p in [0,1].\n\nNow, we can think of each segment PQ as a line connecting (p,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)). The equation of such a line can be parameterized or expressed in slope-intercept form.\n\nLet me find the equation of PQ for a general p.\n\nThe slope m of PQ is (sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) - 0)/(0 - p) = -sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p.\n\nSo, the equation is y = (-sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p\u00b2).\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nAt x = p, y = 0, which is correct.\n\nAt x = 0, y = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2), which is correct. So, the equation is correct.\n\nSo, the equation of PQ is y = [ -sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p ] x + sqrt(1 - p\u00b2).\n\nNow, point C is on AB, so its coordinates satisfy y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe need to find a point C on AB such that it doesn't lie on any other PQ from F except AB itself.\n\nWait, but AB is also a segment in F. Let me see: is AB of unit length?\n\nLet me compute the distance from A to B.\n\nPoint A is (1/2, 0), point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). The distance between A and B is sqrt[ (1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2 ] = sqrt[ (1/4) + (3/4) ] = sqrt(1) = 1. Yes, AB is a segment in F.\n\nSo, AB is in F, and point C is on AB, so it's on AB's segment. But C is not on any other segment from F. So, for all other p \u2260 corresponding to A or B, the segment PQ shouldn't pass through C.\n\nWait, let me think. Each PQ is a line segment between (p,0) and (0, q), with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe need to find point C on AB such that no other PQ (other than AB itself) passes through C.\n\nSo, perhaps point C is the only point on AB that is not intersected by any other PQ from F.\n\nAlternatively, point C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F.\n\nWait, the family F is a set of lines PQ. The envelope of these lines might form a curve, and AB is tangent to this envelope at point C.\n\nHmm, that seems plausible. Because if AB is tangent to the envelope, then C is the point of tangency, which is unique.\n\nSo, perhaps I can find the envelope of the family F and then find where AB is tangent to it. The point of tangency would be C.\n\nHow do I find the envelope of a family of curves? The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point.\n\nFor the family of lines given by F, each line is PQ, which we have the equation y = [ -sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p ] x + sqrt(1 - p\u00b2), where p is a parameter between 0 and 1.\n\nTo find the envelope, we can use the method where we solve the system:\n\nF(p, x, y) = y + [sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p] x - sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 0\n\nand\n\ndF/dp = 0.\n\nSo, compute dF/dp and set it to zero.\n\nLet me compute F(p, x, y):\n\nF(p, x, y) = y + (sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p) x - sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 0\n\nSo, F(p, x, y) = y + x * sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p - sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 0\n\nLet me compute dF/dp:\n\ndF/dp = derivative of F with respect to p.\n\nFirst term: derivative of y with respect to p is 0.\n\nSecond term: x * derivative of sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p with respect to p.\n\nThird term: derivative of -sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) with respect to p.\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nLet me denote f(p) = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p.\n\nCompute f'(p):\n\nf(p) = (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2) / p.\n\nUse quotient rule: [ ( (1/2)(1 - p\u00b2)^(-1/2) (-2p) ) * p - (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2) * 1 ] / p\u00b2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n[ (-p (1 - p\u00b2)^(-1/2) ) * p - (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2) ] \n\n= [ -p\u00b2 (1 - p\u00b2)^(-1/2) - (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2) ]\n\nFactor out -(1 - p\u00b2)^(-1/2):\n\n= - (1 - p\u00b2)^(-1/2) [ p\u00b2 + (1 - p\u00b2) ]\n\n= - (1 - p\u00b2)^(-1/2) [ p\u00b2 +1 - p\u00b2 ]\n\n= - (1 - p\u00b2)^(-1/2) (1)\n\n= -1 / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)\n\nSo, f'(p) = [ -1 / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ] / p\u00b2\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check that.\n\nWait, the derivative of sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) is (1/2)(1 - p\u00b2)^(-1/2)*(-2p) = -p / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2).\n\nThen, using the quotient rule for f(p) = numerator / denominator, where numerator = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2), denominator = p.\n\nSo, f'(p) = [ numerator' * denominator - numerator * denominator' ] / denominator^2\n\nSo, numerator' = -p / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)\n\ndenominator = p, denominator' = 1\n\nSo, f'(p) = [ (-p / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)) * p - sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) * 1 ] / p\u00b2\n\n= [ (-p\u00b2 / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)) - sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ] / p\u00b2\n\nFactor out -1/sqrt(1 - p\u00b2):\n\n= [ - (p\u00b2 + (1 - p\u00b2)) / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ] / p\u00b2\n\n= [ - (1) / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ] / p\u00b2\n\n= -1 / [ p\u00b2 sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ]\n\nSo, f'(p) = -1 / [ p\u00b2 sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ]\n\nOkay, so the derivative of the second term is x * f'(p) = -x / [ p\u00b2 sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ]\n\nNow, the third term is -sqrt(1 - p\u00b2). Its derivative is -(1/(2 sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)))(-2p) )= p / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\ndF/dp = 0 + [ -x / (p\u00b2 sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)) ] + [ p / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ] = 0\n\nSo,\n\n- x / (p\u00b2 sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)) + p / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(1 - p\u00b2):\n\n- x / p\u00b2 + p = 0\n\nSo,\n\n- x / p\u00b2 + p = 0\n\n=> p = x / p\u00b2\n\n=> p\u00b3 = x\n\nSo, from this equation, x = p\u00b3.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. F(p, x, y) = 0: y + x * sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p - sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 0\n\n2. dF/dp = 0: p\u00b3 = x\n\nSo, substituting x = p\u00b3 into equation 1:\n\ny + (p\u00b3) * sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)/p - sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\ny + p\u00b2 sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) - sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 0\n\nFactor sqrt(1 - p\u00b2):\n\ny + sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) (p\u00b2 - 1) = 0\n\nNote that p\u00b2 - 1 = -(1 - p\u00b2), so:\n\ny - sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) (1 - p\u00b2) = 0\n\nSo,\n\ny = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) (1 - p\u00b2)\n\nBut 1 - p\u00b2 = (sqrt(1 - p\u00b2))\u00b2, so:\n\ny = (sqrt(1 - p\u00b2))\u00b3\n\nSo, we have x = p\u00b3 and y = (sqrt(1 - p\u00b2))\u00b3\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nx = p\u00b3\n\ny = (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)\n\nNow, we can try to eliminate the parameter p to find the envelope.\n\nFrom x = p\u00b3, we can write p = x^(1/3)\n\nSubstitute into y:\n\ny = (1 - (x^(1/3))\u00b2 )^(3/2) = (1 - x^(2/3) )^(3/2)\n\nSo, the envelope is y = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2)\n\nLet me see if I can simplify this.\n\nLet me raise both sides to the power of 2/3 to make it easier:\n\ny^(2/3) = (1 - x^(2/3))\n\nSo,\n\ny^(2/3) + x^(2/3) = 1\n\nHmm, that's interesting. It's the equation of an astroid.\n\nYes, the envelope of the family of lines PQ is an astroid given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nSo, the astroid is the envelope of the family F.\n\nNow, we need to find the point C where the line AB is tangent to this astroid.\n\nBecause AB is a member of F, and the envelope is the astroid, AB is tangent to the astroid at point C.\n\nSo, point C is the point of tangency between AB and the astroid.\n\nSo, to find C, we can solve for the intersection of AB and the astroid, and ensure that the tangent to the astroid at that point is the same as AB.\n\nAlternatively, since AB is tangent to the astroid at C, we can find the point where AB touches the astroid and the slope of AB equals the derivative of the astroid at that point.\n\nSo, let's find the point of intersection between AB and the astroid.\n\nAB has equation y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2\n\nThe astroid has equation x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1\n\nSubstitute y from AB into the astroid equation:\n\nx^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) = 1\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated. Let me denote t = x^(1/3), but maybe it's better to let\u2019s set u = x^(2/3) and v = y^(2/3). Then, u + v = 1.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to parametrize the astroid.\n\nThe astroid can be parametrized as:\n\nx = cos^3(theta)\n\ny = sin^3(theta)\n\nfor theta in [0, 2pi)\n\nBut wait, let me confirm.\n\nIf we parametrize as x = cos^3(theta), y = sin^3(theta), then x^(2/3) = cos\u00b2(theta), y^(2/3) = sin\u00b2(theta), so x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = cos\u00b2(theta) + sin\u00b2(theta) = 1. Yes, that works.\n\nSo, parametric equations:\n\nx = cos\u00b3(theta)\n\ny = sin\u00b3(theta)\n\nSo, the astroid is parametrized by theta.\n\nNow, the slope of the tangent to the astroid at theta is given by dy/dx.\n\nCompute dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = (dy/dtheta) / (dx/dtheta)\n\ndy/dtheta = 3 sin\u00b2(theta) cos(theta)\n\ndx/dtheta = -3 cos\u00b2(theta) sin(theta)\n\nSo,\n\ndy/dx = [3 sin\u00b2(theta) cos(theta)] / [ -3 cos\u00b2(theta) sin(theta) ] = - sin(theta) / cos(theta) = -tan(theta)\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent at theta is -tan(theta).\n\nNow, the line AB has slope -sqrt(3). So, to find the point of tangency, set -tan(theta) = -sqrt(3) => tan(theta) = sqrt(3) => theta = pi/3 or 4pi/3.\n\nBut since we are in the first quadrant (the astroid is in the first quadrant, right?), theta should be between 0 and pi/2.\n\nWait, let me think. The astroid is symmetric in all quadrants, but our family F is in the first quadrant, so the envelope is the part of the astroid in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, theta is between 0 and pi/2.\n\nSo, tan(theta) = sqrt(3) => theta = pi/3.\n\nSo, theta = pi/3.\n\nSo, the point of tangency is at theta = pi/3.\n\nCompute x and y:\n\nx = cos\u00b3(pi/3) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8\n\ny = sin\u00b3(pi/3) = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3*sqrt(3))/8\n\nSo, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 )\n\nWait, but let's check if this point lies on AB.\n\nAB has equation y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2\n\nLet me plug x = 1/8 into AB's equation:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8\n\nWhich matches the y-coordinate of the astroid point. So, yes, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 )\n\nWait, but let me confirm: point C is on AB, which goes from A(1/2,0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The point (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ) is on AB because when x=1/8, y=3 sqrt(3)/8, which is consistent with AB's equation.\n\nSo, that's our point C.\n\nNow, compute OC\u00b2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C.\n\nOC\u00b2 = (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^2\n\n= 1/64 + (27)/64\n\n= (1 + 27)/64\n\n= 28/64\n\nSimplify 28/64: divide numerator and denominator by 4, get 7/16.\n\nSo, OC\u00b2 = 7/16.\n\nThus, p =7, q=16, and p + q =23.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculation of OC\u00b2.\n\nx = 1/8, y=3 sqrt(3)/8\n\nx\u00b2 = (1)^2 / (8)^2 = 1/64\n\ny\u00b2 = (3 sqrt(3))^2 / (8)^2 = (9 *3)/64 = 27/64\n\nSum: 1/64 +27/64 =28/64 =7/16.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 7 +16=23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{23}\n\n\nGiven points \\( O(0,0) \\), \\( A\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right) \\), and \\( B\\left(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\), we need to find a unique point \\( C \\) on segment \\( \\overline{AB} \\) that does not belong to any other segment from the family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) except \\( \\overline{AB} \\). The family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) consists of segments \\( \\overline{PQ} \\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \\( P \\) on the \\( x \\)-axis and \\( Q \\) on the \\( y \\)-axis.\n\nFirst, we determine the equation of line \\( \\overline{AB} \\). The slope of \\( \\overline{AB} \\) is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \\frac{1}{2}} = -\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\nThus, the equation of \\( \\overline{AB} \\) is:\n\\[\ny = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the family of segments \\( \\overline{PQ} \\) with unit length. Each segment connects \\( (p, 0) \\) to \\( (0, \\sqrt{1 - p^2}) \\). The equation of such a line is:\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{\\sqrt{1 - p^2}}{p}x + \\sqrt{1 - p^2}\n\\]\n\nTo find the envelope of these lines, we solve the system:\n1. \\( F(p, x, y) = y + \\frac{\\sqrt{1 - p^2}}{p}x - \\sqrt{1 - p^2} = 0 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{dF}{dp} = 0 \\)\n\nFrom the derivative condition, we find:\n\\[\nx = p^3\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( x = p^3 \\) into the line equation, we get:\n\\[\ny = (1 - p^2)^{3/2}\n\\]\n\nThe envelope of these lines forms an astroid given by:\n\\[\nx^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1\n\\]\n\nWe find the point where \\( \\overline{AB} \\) is tangent to this astroid. The parametric equations for the astroid are:\n\\[\nx = \\cos^3(\\theta), \\quad y = \\sin^3(\\theta)\n\\]\nThe slope of the tangent to the astroid at \\( \\theta \\) is \\( -\\tan(\\theta) \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). We need to find a point C on segment AB such that C is not on any other segment from the family F except for AB itself. Then, we have to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the coordinate plane. O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere up on the y-axis, since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, which is less than 1. So, AB is a line segment connecting these two points.\n\nThe family F consists of segments PQ of unit length, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, lying in the first quadrant. So, each PQ is a line segment from some point P(p,0) to Q(0,q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the length of PQ is 1. Since the segment is in the first quadrant, both p and q are positive.\n\nWait, so for each PQ in F, we have sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. That's because the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2). So, the condition is p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nSo, the family F is all such segments where p and q are positive, p^2 + q^2 = 1, and the segment PQ is in the first quadrant. So, each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) with p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nWe are to find a point C on AB such that C is only on AB and no other PQ from F. So, C is unique in that it's not intersected by any other PQ except AB.\n\nHmm, so AB is one such segment from F? Let's check. The length of AB is sqrt((1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2). That's sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment in F. So, AB is one of the PQ segments in F, specifically when p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, the family F includes all such segments where p and q are positive, p^2 + q^2 = 1, and the segment PQ is in the first quadrant. So, each PQ is a line from (p,0) to (0,q) where p and q satisfy p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nNow, we need to find a point C on AB such that it's not on any other PQ in F. So, except for AB, no other segment from F passes through C.\n\nSo, the first step is probably to find the equation of AB, then find the point C on AB which is not on any other PQ from F.\n\nSo, let's find the equation of AB. Points A and B are (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2), respectively. The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. To find c, plug in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nNow, any point C on AB can be parameterized. Let me express point C as (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2), where t ranges from 0 to 1/2.\n\nWait, when x is 0, y is sqrt(3)/2 (point B), and when x is 1/2, y is 0 (point A). So, yes, t is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nWe need to find such a C that is not on any other segment PQ in F except AB. So, suppose there's another PQ in F that passes through C. Then, we need to ensure that this is impossible except for PQ being AB itself.\n\nSo, let's suppose that C lies on another segment PQ from F. Then, PQ is a line from (p,0) to (0,q), with p^2 + q^2 = 1, and C lies on this segment.\n\nWe need to find if such a p and q exist for a given C on AB, except when PQ is AB itself.\n\nSo, the idea is that for any other PQ, the point C cannot lie on it. So, we need to find the point C on AB where this is true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. Because in problems where a point is only on one member of a family, it's often where the envelope touches, meaning the point is on the boundary of all the family's segments.\n\nWait, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, perhaps the envelope of the family F is a curve, and the point C is where AB is tangent to this envelope.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, we can model this problem parametrically.\n\nGiven any PQ in F, it's a line from (p,0) to (0,q), with p^2 + q^2 = 1. The equation of PQ can be written as (x/p) + (y/q) = 1.\n\nBecause the intercept form of a line is x/a + y/b = 1, where a and b are the intercepts on the x and y axes, respectively. So, for PQ, the equation is x/p + y/q = 1.\n\nSo, the family F is all lines x/p + y/q = 1, where p^2 + q^2 = 1, p>0, q>0.\n\nWe need to find the point C on AB that does not lie on any other line from F except AB itself.\n\nSo, if C is on AB, which is x/p + y/q =1 with p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2, then we need to ensure that for no other p and q with p^2 + q^2=1 does the line x/p + y/q =1 pass through C.\n\nSo, suppose point C is (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2). We can substitute this into the equation of PQ:\n\nt/p + [(-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)] / q = 1.\n\nBut since p^2 + q^2 =1, we can write q = sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nSo, substituting, we get:\n\nt/p + [(-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)] / sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.\n\nWe need to find if there's any p (other than p=1/2) such that this equation holds for point C.\n\nIf such a p exists, then C lies on another PQ from F, which we don't want. So, we need to find the point C where this equation has no solution for p except p=1/2.\n\nAlternatively, for the point C, the equation in p must have only one solution, which is p=1/2. So, we can think of this as a quadratic equation in p, and set the discriminant to zero, which would give us only one solution, p=1/2.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\nt/p + [(-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)] / sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.\n\nLet me denote this equation as:\n\nA/p + B * 1/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1,\n\nwhere A = t and B = (-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2).\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square roots, but that could introduce extraneous solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can let p be a variable and express the equation in terms of p, then solve for p in terms of t, and set the discriminant to zero so that the equation has only one solution (p=1/2).\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, let's denote C = (t, y(t)), where y(t) = -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe substitute into the equation x/p + y/q = 1:\n\nt/p + y(t)/q = 1.\n\nBut since p^2 + q^2 =1, q = sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nt/p + [(-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)] / sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.\n\nLet me denote sqrt(1 - p^2) as s for simplicity.\n\nThen, s = sqrt(1 - p^2), so p^2 + s^2 =1.\n\nOur equation becomes:\n\nt/p + [(-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)] / s = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by p*s to eliminate denominators:\n\nt*s + [(-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)] * p = p*s.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\nt*s + (-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) p = p s.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nt*s + (-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) p - p s = 0.\n\nFactor terms with p:\n\nt*s + p [ (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 - s ) ] = 0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I can express s in terms of p.\n\nSince s = sqrt(1 - p^2), perhaps we can square both sides after moving some terms.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to write this equation in terms of p:\n\nLet me write it again:\n\nt/p + [(-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)] / sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\nt/p + K / sqrt(1 - p^2) =1,\n\nwhere K = (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSo, t/p + K / sqrt(1 - p^2) =1.\n\nLet me denote u = p, so that s = sqrt(1 - u^2).\n\nThen, equation becomes:\n\nt/u + K / sqrt(1 - u^2) =1.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nt/u = 1 - K / sqrt(1 - u^2).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(t/u)^2 = [1 - K / sqrt(1 - u^2)]^2.\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n1 - 2 K / sqrt(1 - u^2) + (K^2)/(1 - u^2).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nt^2 / u^2 = 1 - 2 K / sqrt(1 - u^2) + K^2 / (1 - u^2).\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 - u^2):\n\nt^2 (1 - u^2)/u^2 = (1 - u^2) - 2 K sqrt(1 - u^2) + K^2.\n\nHmm, this seems getting complicated. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the family F differently. Since p^2 + q^2 =1, we can write p = cos\u03b8 and q = sin\u03b8 for \u03b8 in (0, \u03c0/2). Because p and q are positive, \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2.\n\nSo, each PQ can be represented by \u03b8, where P is (cos\u03b8, 0) and Q is (0, sin\u03b8). The equation of PQ is x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo, the family F is all lines x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1 for \u03b8 in (0, \u03c0/2).\n\nSo, for any point (x,y), it lies on some PQ in F if there exists \u03b8 such that x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo, for point C = (t, y(t)) on AB, we need to find if there exists \u03b8 \u2260 \u03c0/3 such that t/cos\u03b8 + y(t)/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nWait, because AB corresponds to \u03b8 where p=1/2, so cos\u03b8 = 1/2, so \u03b8=\u03c0/3 (since cos(\u03c0/3)=1/2). So, AB is the case when \u03b8=\u03c0/3.\n\nTherefore, for C to lie only on AB, the equation t/cos\u03b8 + y(t)/sin\u03b8 =1 must have only \u03b8=\u03c0/3 as a solution.\n\nSo, the equation:\n\nt/cos\u03b8 + [(-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2)] / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nt/cos\u03b8 + [sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2)] / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me factor sqrt(3):\n\nt/cos\u03b8 + sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2)/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nt sec\u03b8 + sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2) csc\u03b8 =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express this in terms of tan\u03b8 or something.\n\nLet me denote tan\u03b8 = k, so that sin\u03b8 = k / sqrt(1 +k^2), cos\u03b8 = 1 / sqrt(1 +k^2).\n\nSo, sec\u03b8 = sqrt(1 +k^2), csc\u03b8 = sqrt(1 +k^2)/k.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nt * sqrt(1 +k^2) + sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2) * sqrt(1 +k^2)/k =1.\n\nFactor sqrt(1 +k^2):\n\nsqrt(1 +k^2) [ t + sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2)/k ] =1.\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(1 +k^2) [ t + sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2)/k ]^2 =1.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps I can expand it.\n\nLet me denote A = t + sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2)/k.\n\nThen, (1 +k^2) A^2 =1.\n\nBut expanding A:\n\nA = t + sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2)/k.\n\nLet me compute A:\n\nA = t - (sqrt(3) t)/k + (sqrt(3)/2)/k.\n\nLet me factor terms with t and constants:\n\nA = t(1 - sqrt(3)/k) + sqrt(3)/(2k).\n\nSo, A = t ( (k - sqrt(3))/k ) + sqrt(3)/(2k).\n\nHmm, perhaps not so helpful. Maybe I should just expand [ t + sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2)/k ]^2.\n\nSo, expanding:\n\n[ t + sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2)/k ]^2 = t^2 + 2 t * sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2)/k + [ sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2)/k ]^2.\n\nSo, that's:\n\nt^2 + [ 2 sqrt(3) t (-t + 1/2) ] /k + [ 3 (-t + 1/2)^2 ] / k^2.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n(1 +k^2) [ t^2 + (2 sqrt(3) t (-t + 1/2))/k + (3 (-t + 1/2)^2)/k^2 ] =1.\n\nThis seems very messy. Maybe I should consider another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps using the concept of the envelope. The envelope of the family F would be the set of points where each point is touched by exactly one member of F. So, if C is on the envelope, then it's only touched by AB, which is one member. So, maybe the envelope is a curve that AB is tangent to, and C is the point of tangency.\n\nSo, to find the envelope, we can use the method for finding the envelope of a family of curves.\n\nGiven the family F: x/p + y/q =1, with p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nWe can use the method where the envelope satisfies both the equation of the family and the derivative with respect to the parameter (here, the parameter can be p, but since p and q are related, perhaps better to parameterize by \u03b8 as before).\n\nWait, perhaps parameterizing by \u03b8 is better.\n\nSo, the family is x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1, \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0/2).\n\nThe envelope can be found by solving the system:\n\nx/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1,\n\nand\n\nd(x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8)/d\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo, compute the derivative of the equation with respect to \u03b8 and set it to zero.\n\nSo, derivative:\n\nd/d\u03b8 [x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8] = x sin\u03b8 / cos^2\u03b8 - y cos\u03b8 / sin^2\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo, x sin\u03b8 / cos^2\u03b8 = y cos\u03b8 / sin^2\u03b8.\n\nMultiply both sides by cos^2\u03b8 sin^2\u03b8:\n\nx sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8.\n\nSo, x sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8.\n\nSo, from the envelope condition, we have:\n\nx sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8.\n\nAnd from the original equation, we have:\n\nx/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1. x sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8.\n\n2. x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nWe can solve for x and y in terms of \u03b8.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = y (cos^3\u03b8)/sin^3\u03b8 = y cot^3\u03b8.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n(y cot^3\u03b8)/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\ny cot^3\u03b8 / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nExpress cot\u03b8 as cos\u03b8/sin\u03b8:\n\ny (cos^3\u03b8 / sin^3\u03b8) / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSimplify the first term:\n\ny cos^2\u03b8 / sin^3\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nFactor out y / sin\u03b8:\n\ny / sin\u03b8 [ cos^2\u03b8 / sin^2\u03b8 + 1 ] =1.\n\nSimplify the bracket:\n\ncos^2\u03b8 / sin^2\u03b8 +1 = (cos^2\u03b8 + sin^2\u03b8)/sin^2\u03b8 = 1/sin^2\u03b8.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\ny / sin\u03b8 * (1 / sin^2\u03b8) ) =1.\n\nWhich is y / sin^3\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo, y = sin^3\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 1: x = y cot^3\u03b8 = sin^3\u03b8 * (cos\u03b8 / sin\u03b8)^3 = sin^3\u03b8 * cos^3\u03b8 / sin^3\u03b8 = cos^3\u03b8.\n\nSo, x=cos^3\u03b8, y=sin^3\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, the envelope is the parametric curve (cos^3\u03b8, sin^3\u03b8).\n\nSo, the envelope is called a astroid, which is a hypocycloid with four cusps.\n\nSo, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nWait, let's check. For the astroid, the parametric equations are x = cos^3\u03b8, y = sin^3\u03b8, which can be written as x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = cos^2\u03b8 + sin^2\u03b8 =1. Yes, so the envelope is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nSo, the astroid is the envelope of the family F.\n\nTherefore, any point on the astroid is touched by exactly one PQ from F. So, the point C we are seeking is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nBecause if AB is tangent to the astroid, then the point of tangency C is only on AB and no other PQ from F.\n\nSo, now, we need to find the point C where AB is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nSo, let's find the condition for the line AB to be tangent to the astroid.\n\nThe equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe need to find the point (x,y) on the astroid where the tangent line is AB.\n\nThe tangent line to the astroid at a point (x,y) can be found using the derivative.\n\nFirst, let me find the derivative of the astroid.\n\nThe astroid is given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to x:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx =0.\n\nSo,\n\ndy/dx = - [x^(-1/3) ] / [y^(-1/3)] = - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)).\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent at (x,y) is - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)).\n\nWe know that the slope of AB is -sqrt(3). So, for the tangent to AB, we have:\n\n- (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3).\n\nSimplify:\n\n(y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)) = sqrt(3).\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3:\n\ny / x = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3*sqrt(3).\n\nSo, y = 3 sqrt(3) x.\n\nBut we also know that (x,y) lies on AB: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting y from above into AB's equation:\n\n3 sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nLet me solve for x.\n\nBring terms with x to one side:\n\n3 sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nFactor sqrt(3) x:\n\nsqrt(3) x (3 +1 ) = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(3) x *4 = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n4x = 1/2.\n\nSo,\n\nx = (1/2)/4 = 1/8.\n\nSo, x=1/8.\n\nThen, y=3 sqrt(3) * (1/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nSo, the point of tangency is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nBut wait, we need to check if this point lies on the astroid.\n\nCompute x^(2/3) + y^(2/3):\n\n( (1/8)^(2/3) ) + ( (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^(2/3) )\n\nFirst, (1/8)^(2/3) = ( (1/8)^(1/3) )^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nSecond, (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^(2/3):\n\nLet me compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, 3 sqrt(3) = 3 * 3^(1/2) = 3^(3/2).\n\nSo, 3 sqrt(3)/8 = 3^(3/2)/8.\n\nRaise this to the 2/3 power:\n\n(3^(3/2)/8 )^(2/3) = 3^( (3/2)*(2/3) ) / 8^(2/3) = 3^1 / (8^(2/3)).\n\n8^(2/3) = (2^3)^(2/3) )= 2^2=4.\n\nSo, 3 /4.\n\nSo, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1/4 + 3/4=1.\n\nYes, it lies on the astroid. So, the point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nWait, but wait a second. The point C is on AB, right?\n\nLet me check if (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8) is on AB.\n\nAB's equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nPlug x=1/8:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the point (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8) is on AB and also on the astroid, and the tangent at this point is AB itself.\n\nTherefore, this point C is the unique point on AB that is only on AB and no other PQ from F.\n\nSo, now, we need to compute OC^2, which is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(1/8)^2 =1/64.\n\n(3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 =9*3 /64=27/64.\n\nSo, OC^2=1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nWait, 1 +27=28, 28/64 simplifies to 7/16.\n\nSo, OC^2=7/16.\n\nTherefore, p=7 and q=16, which are coprime.\n\nSo, p+q=23.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, when I computed x^(2/3) + y^(2/3), I had x=1/8, so x^(2/3)= (1/8)^(2/3)= ( (1/8)^(1/3) )^2= (1/2)^2=1/4.\n\ny=3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nCompute y^(2/3):\n\n(3 sqrt(3)/8 )^(2/3).\n\nLet me compute it again.\n\nFirst, 3 sqrt(3)=3^(1) *3^(1/2)=3^(3/2).\n\nSo, 3 sqrt(3)/8=3^(3/2)/8.\n\nRaise to the 2/3 power:\n\n(3^(3/2)/8 )^(2/3)=3^( (3/2)*(2/3) ) /8^(2/3)=3^1 / (8^(2/3)).\n\n8^(2/3)= (2^3)^(2/3)=2^(2)=4.\n\nSo, 3/4.\n\nSo, x^(2/3)+y^(2/3)=1/4 +3/4=1.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nOC^2 is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/8)^2=1/64.\n\n(3 sqrt(3)/8)^2= (9*3)/64=27/64.\n\nSo, 1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, OC^2=7/16, so p=7, q=16, and p+q=23.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we first identify the family of segments $\\overline{PQ}$ of unit length in the first quadrant, where $P$ is on the $x$-axis and $Q$ is on the $y$-axis.

      "full_content": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). We need to find a point C on segment AB such that C is not on any other segment from the family F except for AB itself. Then, we have to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the coordinate plane. O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere up on the y-axis, since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, which is less than 1. So, AB is a line segment connecting these two points.\n\nThe family F consists of segments PQ of unit length, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, lying in the first quadrant. So, each PQ is a line segment from some point P(p,0) to Q(0,q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the length of PQ is 1. Since the segment is in the first quadrant, both p and q are positive.\n\nWait, so for each PQ in F, we have sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. That's because the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2). So, the condition is p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nSo, the family F is all such segments where p and q are positive, p^2 + q^2 = 1, and the segment PQ is in the first quadrant. So, each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) with p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nWe are to find a point C on AB such that C is only on AB and no other PQ from F. So, C is unique in that it's not intersected by any other PQ except AB.\n\nHmm, so AB is one such segment from F? Let's check. The length of AB is sqrt((1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2). That's sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment in F. So, AB is one of the PQ segments in F, specifically when p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, the family F includes all such segments where p and q are positive, p^2 + q^2 = 1, and the segment PQ is in the first quadrant. So, each PQ is a line from (p,0) to (0,q) where p and q satisfy p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nNow, we need to find a point C on AB such that it's not on any other PQ in F. So, except for AB, no other segment from F passes through C.\n\nSo, the first step is probably to find the equation of AB, then find the point C on AB which is not on any other PQ from F.\n\nSo, let's find the equation of AB. Points A and B are (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2), respectively. The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. To find c, plug in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nNow, any point C on AB can be parameterized. Let me express point C as (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2), where t ranges from 0 to 1/2.\n\nWait, when x is 0, y is sqrt(3)/2 (point B), and when x is 1/2, y is 0 (point A). So, yes, t is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nWe need to find such a C that is not on any other segment PQ in F except AB. So, suppose there's another PQ in F that passes through C. Then, we need to ensure that this is impossible except for PQ being AB itself.\n\nSo, let's suppose that C lies on another segment PQ from F. Then, PQ is a line from (p,0) to (0,q), with p^2 + q^2 = 1, and C lies on this segment.\n\nWe need to find if such a p and q exist for a given C on AB, except when PQ is AB itself.\n\nSo, the idea is that for any other PQ, the point C cannot lie on it. So, we need to find the point C on AB where this is true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. Because in problems where a point is only on one member of a family, it's often where the envelope touches, meaning the point is on the boundary of all the family's segments.\n\nWait, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, perhaps the envelope of the family F is a curve, and the point C is where AB is tangent to this envelope.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, we can model this problem parametrically.\n\nGiven any PQ in F, it's a line from (p,0) to (0,q), with p^2 + q^2 = 1. The equation of PQ can be written as (x/p) + (y/q) = 1.\n\nBecause the intercept form of a line is x/a + y/b = 1, where a and b are the intercepts on the x and y axes, respectively. So, for PQ, the equation is x/p + y/q = 1.\n\nSo, the family F is all lines x/p + y/q = 1, where p^2 + q^2 = 1, p>0, q>0.\n\nWe need to find the point C on AB that does not lie on any other line from F except AB itself.\n\nSo, if C is on AB, which is x/p + y/q =1 with p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2, then we need to ensure that for no other p and q with p^2 + q^2=1 does the line x/p + y/q =1 pass through C.\n\nSo, suppose point C is (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2). We can substitute this into the equation of PQ:\n\nt/p + [(-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)] / q = 1.\n\nBut since p^2 + q^2 =1, we can write q = sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nSo, substituting, we get:\n\nt/p + [(-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)] / sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.\n\nWe need to find if there's any p (other than p=1/2) such that this equation holds for point C.\n\nIf such a p exists, then C lies on another PQ from F, which we don't want. So, we need to find the point C where this equation has no solution for p except p=1/2.\n\nAlternatively, for the point C, the equation in p must have only one solution, which is p=1/2. So, we can think of this as a quadratic equation in p, and set the discriminant to zero, which would give us only one solution, p=1/2.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\nt/p + [(-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)] / sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.\n\nLet me denote this equation as:\n\nA/p + B * 1/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1,\n\nwhere A = t and B = (-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2).\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square roots, but that could introduce extraneous solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can let p be a variable and express the equation in terms of p, then solve for p in terms of t, and set the discriminant to zero so that the equation has only one solution (p=1/2).\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, let's denote C = (t, y(t)), where y(t) = -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe substitute into the equation x/p + y/q = 1:\n\nt/p + y(t)/q = 1.\n\nBut since p^2 + q^2 =1, q = sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nt/p + [(-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)] / sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.\n\nLet me denote sqrt(1 - p^2) as s for simplicity.\n\nThen, s = sqrt(1 - p^2), so p^2 + s^2 =1.\n\nOur equation becomes:\n\nt/p + [(-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)] / s = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by p*s to eliminate denominators:\n\nt*s + [(-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)] * p = p*s.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\nt*s + (-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) p = p s.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nt*s + (-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) p - p s = 0.\n\nFactor terms with p:\n\nt*s + p [ (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 - s ) ] = 0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I can express s in terms of p.\n\nSince s = sqrt(1 - p^2), perhaps we can square both sides after moving some terms.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to write this equation in terms of p:\n\nLet me write it again:\n\nt/p + [(-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)] / sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\nt/p + K / sqrt(1 - p^2) =1,\n\nwhere K = (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSo, t/p + K / sqrt(1 - p^2) =1.\n\nLet me denote u = p, so that s = sqrt(1 - u^2).\n\nThen, equation becomes:\n\nt/u + K / sqrt(1 - u^2) =1.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nt/u = 1 - K / sqrt(1 - u^2).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(t/u)^2 = [1 - K / sqrt(1 - u^2)]^2.\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n1 - 2 K / sqrt(1 - u^2) + (K^2)/(1 - u^2).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nt^2 / u^2 = 1 - 2 K / sqrt(1 - u^2) + K^2 / (1 - u^2).\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 - u^2):\n\nt^2 (1 - u^2)/u^2 = (1 - u^2) - 2 K sqrt(1 - u^2) + K^2.\n\nHmm, this seems getting complicated. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the family F differently. Since p^2 + q^2 =1, we can write p = cos\u03b8 and q = sin\u03b8 for \u03b8 in (0, \u03c0/2). Because p and q are positive, \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2.\n\nSo, each PQ can be represented by \u03b8, where P is (cos\u03b8, 0) and Q is (0, sin\u03b8). The equation of PQ is x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo, the family F is all lines x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1 for \u03b8 in (0, \u03c0/2).\n\nSo, for any point (x,y), it lies on some PQ in F if there exists \u03b8 such that x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo, for point C = (t, y(t)) on AB, we need to find if there exists \u03b8 \u2260 \u03c0/3 such that t/cos\u03b8 + y(t)/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nWait, because AB corresponds to \u03b8 where p=1/2, so cos\u03b8 = 1/2, so \u03b8=\u03c0/3 (since cos(\u03c0/3)=1/2). So, AB is the case when \u03b8=\u03c0/3.\n\nTherefore, for C to lie only on AB, the equation t/cos\u03b8 + y(t)/sin\u03b8 =1 must have only \u03b8=\u03c0/3 as a solution.\n\nSo, the equation:\n\nt/cos\u03b8 + [(-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2)] / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nt/cos\u03b8 + [sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2)] / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me factor sqrt(3):\n\nt/cos\u03b8 + sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2)/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nt sec\u03b8 + sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2) csc\u03b8 =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express this in terms of tan\u03b8 or something.\n\nLet me denote tan\u03b8 = k, so that sin\u03b8 = k / sqrt(1 +k^2), cos\u03b8 = 1 / sqrt(1 +k^2).\n\nSo, sec\u03b8 = sqrt(1 +k^2), csc\u03b8 = sqrt(1 +k^2)/k.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nt * sqrt(1 +k^2) + sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2) * sqrt(1 +k^2)/k =1.\n\nFactor sqrt(1 +k^2):\n\nsqrt(1 +k^2) [ t + sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2)/k ] =1.\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(1 +k^2) [ t + sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2)/k ]^2 =1.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps I can expand it.\n\nLet me denote A = t + sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2)/k.\n\nThen, (1 +k^2) A^2 =1.\n\nBut expanding A:\n\nA = t + sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2)/k.\n\nLet me compute A:\n\nA = t - (sqrt(3) t)/k + (sqrt(3)/2)/k.\n\nLet me factor terms with t and constants:\n\nA = t(1 - sqrt(3)/k) + sqrt(3)/(2k).\n\nSo, A = t ( (k - sqrt(3))/k ) + sqrt(3)/(2k).\n\nHmm, perhaps not so helpful. Maybe I should just expand [ t + sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2)/k ]^2.\n\nSo, expanding:\n\n[ t + sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2)/k ]^2 = t^2 + 2 t * sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2)/k + [ sqrt(3)(-t + 1/2)/k ]^2.\n\nSo, that's:\n\nt^2 + [ 2 sqrt(3) t (-t + 1/2) ] /k + [ 3 (-t + 1/2)^2 ] / k^2.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n(1 +k^2) [ t^2 + (2 sqrt(3) t (-t + 1/2))/k + (3 (-t + 1/2)^2)/k^2 ] =1.\n\nThis seems very messy. Maybe I should consider another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps using the concept of the envelope. The envelope of the family F would be the set of points where each point is touched by exactly one member of F. So, if C is on the envelope, then it's only touched by AB, which is one member. So, maybe the envelope is a curve that AB is tangent to, and C is the point of tangency.\n\nSo, to find the envelope, we can use the method for finding the envelope of a family of curves.\n\nGiven the family F: x/p + y/q =1, with p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nWe can use the method where the envelope satisfies both the equation of the family and the derivative with respect to the parameter (here, the parameter can be p, but since p and q are related, perhaps better to parameterize by \u03b8 as before).\n\nWait, perhaps parameterizing by \u03b8 is better.\n\nSo, the family is x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1, \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0/2).\n\nThe envelope can be found by solving the system:\n\nx/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1,\n\nand\n\nd(x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8)/d\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo, compute the derivative of the equation with respect to \u03b8 and set it to zero.\n\nSo, derivative:\n\nd/d\u03b8 [x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8] = x sin\u03b8 / cos^2\u03b8 - y cos\u03b8 / sin^2\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo, x sin\u03b8 / cos^2\u03b8 = y cos\u03b8 / sin^2\u03b8.\n\nMultiply both sides by cos^2\u03b8 sin^2\u03b8:\n\nx sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8.\n\nSo, x sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8.\n\nSo, from the envelope condition, we have:\n\nx sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8.\n\nAnd from the original equation, we have:\n\nx/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1. x sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8.\n\n2. x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nWe can solve for x and y in terms of \u03b8.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = y (cos^3\u03b8)/sin^3\u03b8 = y cot^3\u03b8.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n(y cot^3\u03b8)/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\ny cot^3\u03b8 / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nExpress cot\u03b8 as cos\u03b8/sin\u03b8:\n\ny (cos^3\u03b8 / sin^3\u03b8) / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSimplify the first term:\n\ny cos^2\u03b8 / sin^3\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nFactor out y / sin\u03b8:\n\ny / sin\u03b8 [ cos^2\u03b8 / sin^2\u03b8 + 1 ] =1.\n\nSimplify the bracket:\n\ncos^2\u03b8 / sin^2\u03b8 +1 = (cos^2\u03b8 + sin^2\u03b8)/sin^2\u03b8 = 1/sin^2\u03b8.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\ny / sin\u03b8 * (1 / sin^2\u03b8) ) =1.\n\nWhich is y / sin^3\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo, y = sin^3\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 1: x = y cot^3\u03b8 = sin^3\u03b8 * (cos\u03b8 / sin\u03b8)^3 = sin^3\u03b8 * cos^3\u03b8 / sin^3\u03b8 = cos^3\u03b8.\n\nSo, x=cos^3\u03b8, y=sin^3\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, the envelope is the parametric curve (cos^3\u03b8, sin^3\u03b8).\n\nSo, the envelope is called a astroid, which is a hypocycloid with four cusps.\n\nSo, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nWait, let's check. For the astroid, the parametric equations are x = cos^3\u03b8, y = sin^3\u03b8, which can be written as x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = cos^2\u03b8 + sin^2\u03b8 =1. Yes, so the envelope is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nSo, the astroid is the envelope of the family F.\n\nTherefore, any point on the astroid is touched by exactly one PQ from F. So, the point C we are seeking is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nBecause if AB is tangent to the astroid, then the point of tangency C is only on AB and no other PQ from F.\n\nSo, now, we need to find the point C where AB is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nSo, let's find the condition for the line AB to be tangent to the astroid.\n\nThe equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe need to find the point (x,y) on the astroid where the tangent line is AB.\n\nThe tangent line to the astroid at a point (x,y) can be found using the derivative.\n\nFirst, let me find the derivative of the astroid.\n\nThe astroid is given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to x:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx =0.\n\nSo,\n\ndy/dx = - [x^(-1/3) ] / [y^(-1/3)] = - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)).\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent at (x,y) is - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)).\n\nWe know that the slope of AB is -sqrt(3). So, for the tangent to AB, we have:\n\n- (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3).\n\nSimplify:\n\n(y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)) = sqrt(3).\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3:\n\ny / x = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3*sqrt(3).\n\nSo, y = 3 sqrt(3) x.\n\nBut we also know that (x,y) lies on AB: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting y from above into AB's equation:\n\n3 sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nLet me solve for x.\n\nBring terms with x to one side:\n\n3 sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nFactor sqrt(3) x:\n\nsqrt(3) x (3 +1 ) = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(3) x *4 = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n4x = 1/2.\n\nSo,\n\nx = (1/2)/4 = 1/8.\n\nSo, x=1/8.\n\nThen, y=3 sqrt(3) * (1/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nSo, the point of tangency is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nBut wait, we need to check if this point lies on the astroid.\n\nCompute x^(2/3) + y^(2/3):\n\n( (1/8)^(2/3) ) + ( (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^(2/3) )\n\nFirst, (1/8)^(2/3) = ( (1/8)^(1/3) )^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nSecond, (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^(2/3):\n\nLet me compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, 3 sqrt(3) = 3 * 3^(1/2) = 3^(3/2).\n\nSo, 3 sqrt(3)/8 = 3^(3/2)/8.\n\nRaise this to the 2/3 power:\n\n(3^(3/2)/8 )^(2/3) = 3^( (3/2)*(2/3) ) / 8^(2/3) = 3^1 / (8^(2/3)).\n\n8^(2/3) = (2^3)^(2/3) )= 2^2=4.\n\nSo, 3 /4.\n\nSo, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1/4 + 3/4=1.\n\nYes, it lies on the astroid. So, the point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nWait, but wait a second. The point C is on AB, right?\n\nLet me check if (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8) is on AB.\n\nAB's equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nPlug x=1/8:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the point (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8) is on AB and also on the astroid, and the tangent at this point is AB itself.\n\nTherefore, this point C is the unique point on AB that is only on AB and no other PQ from F.\n\nSo, now, we need to compute OC^2, which is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(1/8)^2 =1/64.\n\n(3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 =9*3 /64=27/64.\n\nSo, OC^2=1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nWait, 1 +27=28, 28/64 simplifies to 7/16.\n\nSo, OC^2=7/16.\n\nTherefore, p=7 and q=16, which are coprime.\n\nSo, p+q=23.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, when I computed x^(2/3) + y^(2/3), I had x=1/8, so x^(2/3)= (1/8)^(2/3)= ( (1/8)^(1/3) )^2= (1/2)^2=1/4.\n\ny=3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nCompute y^(2/3):\n\n(3 sqrt(3)/8 )^(2/3).\n\nLet me compute it again.\n\nFirst, 3 sqrt(3)=3^(1) *3^(1/2)=3^(3/2).\n\nSo, 3 sqrt(3)/8=3^(3/2)/8.\n\nRaise to the 2/3 power:\n\n(3^(3/2)/8 )^(2/3)=3^( (3/2)*(2/3) ) /8^(2/3)=3^1 / (8^(2/3)).\n\n8^(2/3)= (2^3)^(2/3)=2^(2)=4.\n\nSo, 3/4.\n\nSo, x^(2/3)+y^(2/3)=1/4 +3/4=1.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nOC^2 is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/8)^2=1/64.\n\n(3 sqrt(3)/8)^2= (9*3)/64=27/64.\n\nSo, 1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, OC^2=7/16, so p=7, q=16, and p+q=23.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first identify the family of segments $\\overline{PQ}$ of unit length in the first quadrant, where $P$ is on the $x$-axis and $Q$ is on the $y$-axis. Each segment satisfies $p^2 + q^2 = 1$ for $P(p,0)$ and $Q(0,q)$. The equation of such a segment is $\\frac{x}{p} + \\frac{y}{q} = 1$.\n\nWe need to find a point $C$ on $\\overline{AB}$ that does not lie on any other segment from this family except $\\overline{AB}$. The line segment $\\overline{AB}$ is given by points $A\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right)$ and $B\\left(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$, with the equation $y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nTo find the unique point $C$, we consider the envelope of the family of segments $\\overline{PQ}$. The envelope is found to be the astroid $x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1$. The point $C$ is where $\\overline{AB}$ is tangent to this astroid.\n\nBy solving the system of equations for the astroid and the tangent line $\\overline{AB}$, we find the point of tangency $C$ at $\\left(\\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\right)$. Calculating $OC^2$:\n\n\\[\nOC^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{27}{64} = \\frac{28}{64} = \\frac{7}{16}.\n\\]\n\nThus, $OC^2 = \\frac{7}{16}$, and $p + q = 7 + 16 = 23$.\n\n$\\boxed{23}$",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it out step by step. \n\nWe have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between O and (1,0), and B is on the y-axis a bit above (0, 1), since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. \n\nThe family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment from some point P(p,0) on the x-axis to some point Q(0,q) on the y-axis, such that the distance between P and Q is 1. So, sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1, right? That means p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, all such segments PQ lie in the first quadrant and have length 1.\n\nNow, the problem says there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, we need to find this point C on AB such that no other PQ in F passes through C except for AB itself.\n\nOur goal is to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, then find p + q.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the setup.\n\nFirst, let's write the equation of line AB. Points A and B are given, so let's find the slope of AB. The slope m is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the line AB has a slope of -sqrt(3).\n\nSince it passes through point A (1/2, 0), the equation of AB can be written using point-slope form: y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, any point C on AB can be parameterized as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) for x between 0 and 1/2, I think. Wait, when x = 1/2, y is 0, which is point A. When x = 0, y is sqrt(3)/2, which is point B. So yes, x ranges from 0 to 1/2 along AB.\n\nWe need to find a point C on AB such that it's not on any other segment PQ in F except for AB itself. So, suppose there exists another segment PQ (different from AB) such that C lies on PQ. But we need C to lie only on AB and no other PQ in F.\n\nSo, our aim is to find C on AB where for no other P and Q on the axes with PQ of length 1, does C lie on PQ.\n\nAlternatively, for any other segment PQ (other than AB), C is not on PQ.\n\nWait, but how do we characterize all such PQ segments?\n\nEach PQ is a line from (p,0) to (0,q), where p^2 + q^2 =1, and p, q >0 since they're in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, the equation of the line PQ can be written as x/p + y/q =1, right? Because it's intercept form.\n\nSo, the line PQ is x/p + y/q =1, with p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nNow, if point C is on AB, which has the equation y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, and C is also on PQ, which is x/p + y/q =1.\n\nSo, for C to lie on both AB and PQ, the coordinates of C must satisfy both equations.\n\nSo, substituting y from AB into PQ's equation:\n\nx/p + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)/q = 1.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\nx/p - (sqrt(3) x)/q + (sqrt(3)/2)/q =1.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nx (1/p - sqrt(3)/q) + (sqrt(3)/(2q)) = 1.\n\nSo, this is an equation in terms of x. For this equation to hold, it must be true for the x-coordinate of point C on AB.\n\nBut since we want point C to lie only on AB and no other PQ, except for AB itself, we need to ensure that for all other PQ in F, this equation doesn't hold for the same C. \n\nWait, but how do we ensure that? Maybe if the system of equations for AB and PQ has a solution only when PQ is AB itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize point C on AB and find conditions on C such that the only PQ that passes through it is AB.\n\nWait, but AB is one of the PQ segments in F, right? Because AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's check if AB is indeed a segment in F.\n\nThe length of AB is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) =1. So yes, AB is in F because its length is 1, and P is on x-axis, Q on y-axis.\n\nSo, for point C on AB, if we can find a condition such that when we set up the equation x/p + y/q =1, with p^2 + q^2=1, the only solution is when p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2, which corresponds to AB itself.\n\nTherefore, for point C on AB, except A and B, we need that for any other p and q with p^2 + q^2=1, the equation x/p + y/q =1 does not hold.\n\nSo, perhaps for point C on AB, the equation x/p + y/q =1 has exactly one solution (p,q) which is (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, for other (p,q), the equation doesn't hold.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure that? Maybe by finding C such that the system of equations has only one solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize point C as (t, -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2) for t between 0 and 1/2.\n\nThen, substitute into the PQ equation x/p + y/q =1:\n\nt/p + (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2)/q =1.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nt/p - (sqrt(3) t)/q + sqrt(3)/(2 q) =1.\n\nLet me factor t:\n\nt(1/p - sqrt(3)/q) + sqrt(3)/(2 q) =1.\n\nNow, since p^2 + q^2 =1, we can parametrize p and q as p=cos(theta), q=sin(theta), since p and q are positive in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, let me let p = cos(theta), q = sin(theta), where theta is between 0 and pi/2.\n\nThen, substituting into the equation:\n\nt (1/cos(theta) - sqrt(3)/sin(theta)) + sqrt(3)/(2 sin(theta)) =1.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nt ( (sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta)) / (sin(theta) cos(theta)) ) + sqrt(3)/(2 sin(theta)) =1.\n\nSimplify the first term:\n\nt ( sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta) ) / ( sin(theta) cos(theta) ) + sqrt(3)/(2 sin(theta)) =1.\n\nMultiply both sides by sin(theta) cos(theta) to eliminate denominators:\n\nt ( sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta) ) + (sqrt(3)/2 cos(theta)) = sin(theta) cos(theta).\n\nNow, let's rearrange terms:\n\nt ( sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta) ) = sin(theta) cos(theta) - (sqrt(3)/2) cos(theta).\n\nFactor out cos(theta) on the right-hand side:\n\nt ( sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta) ) = cos(theta) [ sin(theta) - sqrt(3)/2 ].\n\nSo, we have:\n\nt = [ cos(theta) ( sin(theta) - sqrt(3)/2 ) ] / ( sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta) ).\n\nNow, for a given theta, t is given by this expression. But we want that for the point C on AB, this equation holds only when theta corresponds to the PQ being AB itself.\n\nAB corresponds to p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2, which is theta=60 degrees, since cos(theta)=1/2, sin(theta)=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, theta=pi/3.\n\nTherefore, we need that for all other theta, the equation does not hold for the same t. Hmm, but how does that help?\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of this as, for each theta, there's a t such that point C is on PQ(theta). But we want that for only theta=pi/3, the point C is on PQ(theta). For all other theta, no such C exists on AB except AB itself.\n\nWait, no. Actually, for any theta, the PQ(theta) is a line from (cos(theta),0) to (0,sin(theta)). So, it's a line that might intersect AB at some point C. But we want only the AB segment itself to pass through C, and no other PQ(theta). So, point C should not lie on any other PQ(theta) except AB.\n\nSo, perhaps the point C is such that when we solve for t in terms of theta, the equation has only one solution for theta, which is theta=pi/3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation for t can be solved for theta, and we can find the values of t where the equation has a unique solution for theta.\n\nWait, that might be the way to go. Let's suppose that t is such that the equation has only one solution for theta, which would mean that the equation is tangent to AB at C, making it the only point where PQ(theta) touches AB except at A and B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can set up the system so that the equation has only one solution for theta, meaning that the discriminant is zero.\n\nBut this is getting a bit abstract. Maybe another approach.\n\nLet me consider point C on AB, so C is (t, -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2). We want that this point C does not lie on any other PQ in F except for AB itself.\n\nSo, if we suppose that C lies on another PQ in F, then the equation x/p + y/q =1 must hold, with p^2 + q^2=1, and (p,q) not equal to (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSo, let's set up the equations:\n\nt/p + (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2)/q =1.\n\nAnd p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nWe can think of this as a system of equations in variables p and q. We want that this system has only one solution, which is p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, for the point C, the system:\n\n1. t/p + (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2)/q =1\n\n2. p^2 + q^2=1\n\nShould have exactly one solution (p,q)=(1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, any other solution would mean that another PQ passes through C, which we don't want. So, we need that this system has only one solution.\n\nSo, perhaps the system is such that it's only satisfied when p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2. So, how can we enforce that?\n\nLet me try to manipulate the first equation.\n\nLet me denote equation 1 as:\n\nt/p + ( - sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ) / q = 1.\n\nLet me denote equation 2 as p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nLet me write equation 1 as:\n\n(t q + (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2) p ) / (p q) =1.\n\nWhich implies:\n\nt q + (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2) p = p q.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nt q - sqrt(3) t p + (sqrt(3)/2) p - p q =0.\n\nFactor terms:\n\nt q - sqrt(3) t p + (sqrt(3)/2) p - p q =0.\n\nWait, perhaps factor p and q:\n\np ( - sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 - q ) + q t =0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express q from equation 2 in terms of p and substitute into equation 1.\n\nFrom equation 2: q = sqrt(1 - p^2). Since q>0, we can write q = sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\nt/p + (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2)/sqrt(1 - p^2) =1.\n\nThis looks complicated, but maybe we can square both sides to eliminate the square root. But squaring can introduce extraneous solutions, so we have to be careful.\n\nLet me denote equation 1 as:\n\nt/p + [ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ] / sqrt(1 - p^2) =1.\n\nLet me denote A = t/p, and B = [ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ] / sqrt(1 - p^2). So, equation 1 is A + B =1.\n\nBut perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, let me move one term to the other side:\n\nt/p =1 - [ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ] / sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nThen, square both sides:\n\n(t/p)^2 = [1 - ( -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ) / sqrt(1 - p^2) ]^2.\n\nThis seems messy, but let's proceed.\n\nLet me denote C = ( -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ) / sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(t/p)^2 = (1 - C)^2.\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\n(t/p)^2 =1 - 2 C + C^2.\n\nNow, substitute back C:\n\n(t/p)^2 =1 - 2 [ (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ) / sqrt(1 - p^2) ] + [ (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 )^2 ] / (1 - p^2).\n\nThis is getting quite involved. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that for point C, the only PQ passing through it is AB. So, the line AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. Maybe C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of all PQ segments in F.\n\nWhat's the envelope of the family F?\n\nThe envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family F at some point. So, if we can find the envelope of all PQ segments, then the point C where AB is tangent to this envelope is the unique point that lies only on AB and no other PQ.\n\nSo, let's try to find the envelope of the family F.\n\nEach PQ is given by the line x/p + y/q =1, with p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nTo find the envelope, we can use the method of solving for the condition that a point (x,y) lies on the line x/p + y/q =1 and also satisfies the derivative condition for the envelope.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the method where we treat p and q as parameters related by p^2 + q^2=1, and then find the envelope by eliminating p and q.\n\nWait, let me think. For the envelope, we can consider F(x,y,p,q) = x/p + y/q -1 =0, and the constraint G(p,q)=p^2 + q^2 -1=0.\n\nThen, the envelope satisfies F=0 and dF/dp =0 and dF/dq=0? Wait, no. The envelope is found by solving F=0 along with dF/d\u03bb=0, where \u03bb is a parameter. But in this case, we have a constraint between p and q.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize p and q in terms of a single parameter \u03b8, as I did earlier: p=cos\u03b8, q=sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, the line equation becomes x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nTo find the envelope, we can take the derivative with respect to \u03b8 and set it to zero, along with the original equation.\n\nSo, let's compute d/d\u03b8 (x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 -1) =0.\n\nCompute derivative:\n\nd/d\u03b8 (x/cos\u03b8) = x sin\u03b8 / cos^2\u03b8,\n\nd/d\u03b8 (y/sin\u03b8) = - y cos\u03b8 / sin^2\u03b8,\n\nSo, the derivative is:\n\n(x sin\u03b8)/cos^2\u03b8 - (y cos\u03b8)/sin^2\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo, (x sin\u03b8)/cos^2\u03b8 = (y cos\u03b8)/sin^2\u03b8.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\nx sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8.\n\nSo, x sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8.\n\nBut from the original line equation:\n\nx/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me write that as x = cos\u03b8 (1 - y/sin\u03b8).\n\nSubstitute into x sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8:\n\n[ cos\u03b8 (1 - y/sin\u03b8) ] sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8.\n\nSimplify:\n\ncos\u03b8 (1 - y/sin\u03b8) sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8.\n\nDivide both sides by cos\u03b8 (assuming cos\u03b8 \u22600):\n\n(1 - y/sin\u03b8) sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^2\u03b8.\n\nExpand the left-hand side:\n\nsin^3\u03b8 - y sin^2\u03b8 = y cos^2\u03b8.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nsin^3\u03b8 = y (sin^2\u03b8 + cos^2\u03b8).\n\nBut sin^2\u03b8 + cos^2\u03b8=1, so:\n\nsin^3\u03b8 = y.\n\nThus, y = sin^3\u03b8.\n\nFrom the original line equation, x = cos\u03b8 (1 - y/sin\u03b8).\n\nSubstitute y = sin^3\u03b8:\n\nx = cos\u03b8 (1 - sin^3\u03b8 / sin\u03b8 ) = cos\u03b8 (1 - sin^2\u03b8 ) = cos\u03b8 cos^2\u03b8 = cos^3\u03b8.\n\nSo, the envelope is given parametrically by x=cos^3\u03b8, y=sin^3\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nWait, because if x=cos^3\u03b8, y=sin^3\u03b8, then x^(2/3)=cos^2\u03b8, y^(2/3)=sin^2\u03b8, so x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1. Exactly, so the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nSo, the envelope is the astroid, and the line AB is tangent to this astroid at point C.\n\nTherefore, point C lies on both AB and the astroid, and AB is tangent to the astroid at C.\n\nSo, to find point C, we can find the point of tangency between line AB and the astroid.\n\nSo, let's write the equation of the astroid: x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nAnd the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe can substitute y from AB into the astroid equation and find the point(s) of intersection.\n\nBut since AB is tangent to the astroid, there should be exactly one point of intersection, which is point C.\n\nWait, but wait: AB is a line of the family F itself, right? Because AB is a segment in F, so it's one of the PQs.\n\nBut the envelope is the astroid, which is tangent to each PQ in F. So, AB is tangent to the astroid at point C.\n\nTherefore, substituting y from AB into the astroid equation, we should get a system that has exactly one solution, which is point C.\n\nSo, let's substitute y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nLet me write that:\n\nx^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) =1.\n\nThis looks a bit messy, but perhaps we can make a substitution.\n\nLet me denote t = x^(1/3), so x = t^3.\n\nSimilarly, let me compute y:\n\ny = -sqrt(3) t^3 + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, y = sqrt(3) ( -t^3 + 1/2 ).\n\nThen, y^(2/3) = [ sqrt(3) ( -t^3 + 1/2 ) ]^(2/3 ) = [3^(1/2) (1/2 - t^3) ]^(2/3 ) = 3^(1/3) (1/2 - t^3)^(2/3).\n\nSo, the astroid equation becomes:\n\nt^2 + 3^(1/3) (1/2 - t^3)^(2/3) =1.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but maybe we can find a value of t that satisfies this equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better substitution or method.\n\nWait, perhaps since AB is tangent to the astroid at C, the system of equations (astroid and AB) has exactly one solution, which is C. So, we can solve for x and y.\n\nLet me write the astroid equation as:\n\nx^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nAnd AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSubstitute y into the astroid equation:\n\nx^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) =1.\n\nLet me factor sqrt(3)/2 from the second term inside the brackets:\n\n[ sqrt(3)/2 ( -2x +1 ) ].\n\nSo, [ -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ] = sqrt(3)/2 (1 - 2x).\n\nThus, [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) = [ sqrt(3)/2 (1 - 2x) ]^(2/3 ) = (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3) * (1 - 2x)^(2/3).\n\nCompute (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3):\n\nsqrt(3) is 3^(1/2), so (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) = 3^(1/3) / 2^(2/3).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nx^(2/3) + [ 3^(1/3) / 2^(2/3) ] * (1 - 2x)^(2/3) =1.\n\nLet me denote k = 3^(1/3) / 2^(2/3), which is a constant.\n\nSo, equation is:\n\nx^(2/3) + k (1 - 2x)^(2/3) =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can let u = x^(1/3), so x = u^3, and 1 - 2x =1 - 2u^3.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\nu^2 + k (1 - 2u^3)^(2/3) =1.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can make a substitution such as z = x^(1/3), but I'm not seeing a clear path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that since AB is tangent to the astroid, the system has a double root, so the equation will have a repeated solution. So, perhaps we can set up the equation to have a double root.\n\nLet me denote f(x) = x^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) -1 =0.\n\nFor AB to be tangent to the astroid, f(x) =0 must have a double root, so f(x)=0 and f\u2019(x)=0.\n\nSo, we can set f(x)=0 and f\u2019(x)=0 and solve for x.\n\nBut f(x) is a bit complicated to differentiate, but let's try.\n\nFirst, f(x) = x^(2/3) + [ sqrt(3)/2 (1 - 2x) ]^(2/3) -1.\n\nLet me write f(x) as:\n\nf(x) = x^(2/3) + (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) (1 - 2x)^(2/3) -1.\n\nLet me compute the derivative f\u2019(x):\n\nf\u2019(x) = (2/3) x^(-1/3) + (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) * (2/3) (1 - 2x)^(-1/3) * (-2).\n\nSimplify:\n\nf\u2019(x) = (2/3) x^(-1/3) - (4/3) (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) (1 - 2x)^(-1/3).\n\nNow, at the point of tangency, f(x)=0 and f\u2019(x)=0.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. x^(2/3) + (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) (1 - 2x)^(2/3) =1.\n\n2. (2/3) x^(-1/3) - (4/3) (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) (1 - 2x)^(-1/3) =0.\n\nLet me denote equation 2 as:\n\n(2/3) x^(-1/3) = (4/3) (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) (1 - 2x)^(-1/3).\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators:\n\n2 x^(-1/3) =4 (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) (1 - 2x)^(-1/3).\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx^(-1/3) =2 (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) (1 - 2x)^(-1/3).\n\nLet me write 3^(1/2)/2 as (3/4)^(1/2), so (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) = (3/4)^(1/3).\n\nSo, x^(-1/3) = 2*(3/4)^(1/3) * (1 - 2x)^(-1/3).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nx^(-1/3) = 2*(3/4)^(1/3) * (1 - 2x)^(-1/3).\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n[ x / (1 - 2x) ]^(1/3) = 2*(3/4)^(1/3).\n\nCube both sides:\n\nx / (1 - 2x) = [ 2*(3/4)^(1/3) ]^3.\n\nCompute the right-hand side:\n\n[2]^3 * [ (3/4)^(1/3) ]^3 =8 * (3/4) = 8*(3/4)=6.\n\nSo, x/(1 - 2x)=6.\n\nSolve for x:\n\nx =6(1 - 2x).\n\nx =6 -12x.\n\nBring terms together:\n\nx +12x=6.\n\n13x=6.\n\nx=6/13.\n\nSo, x=6/13. Now, let's find y from the equation of AB:\n\ny= -sqrt(3)*(6/13) + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nCompute:\n\ny= sqrt(3)*(-6/13 +1/2 )= sqrt(3)*(-12/26 +13/26 )= sqrt(3)*(1/26)= sqrt(3)/26.\n\nSo, point C is (6/13, sqrt(3)/26).\n\nTherefore, OC^2 is (6/13)^2 + (sqrt(3)/26)^2.\n\nCompute:\n\n(36/169) + (3)/(676).\n\nConvert to same denominator:\n\n36/169 = 144/676.\n\nSo, 144/676 +3/676=147/676.\n\nSimplify 147 and 676: 147=49*3, 676=4*169=4*13^2. No common factors, so 147/676 is reduced.\n\nTherefore, OC^2=147/676. So p=147, q=676.\n\nWait, but let me check if 147 and 676 are coprime.\n\n147 factors: 3 * 49 =3 *7^2.\n\n676 factors: 26^2= (2*13)^2=2^2 *13^2.\n\nSo, no common prime factors. So yes, 147/676 is reduced.\n\nTherefore, p+q=147+676=823.\n\nWait, but before I get too confident, let me verify my steps because this seems a bit involved.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Found that AB is a segment in F, which is correct because its length is 1.\n\n2. Recognized that the envelope of F is the astroid x^(2/3)+y^(2/3)=1.\n\n3. Since AB is tangent to the astroid at C, we set up the system of equations for the astroid and AB, and using the condition that the derivative is zero (tangency), solved for x and y.\n\n4. Found x=6/13, y=sqrt(3)/26.\n\n5. Calculated OC^2 as (6/13)^2 + (sqrt(3)/26)^2=36/169 +3/676= (144 +3)/676=147/676.\n\n6. Reduced fraction is 147/676, sum is 147+676=823.\n\nWait, but let me check the derivative step again because that's where it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nIn equation 2, after differentiation, I had:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) - (4/3)(3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3)(1-2x)^(-1/3) =0.\n\nI moved the second term to the other side:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) = (4/3)(3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3)(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nThen, multiplied both sides by 3:\n\n2 x^(-1/3) =4 (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3)(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nDivided by 2:\n\nx^(-1/3)=2 (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) (1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nWait, that step seems correct.\n\nThen, I wrote (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) as (3/4)^(1/3), which is correct because (sqrt(3)/2)^2 =3/4, so (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3) = (3/4)^(1/3).\n\nThen, I wrote:\n\nx^(-1/3) =2*(3/4)^(1/3)*(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nThen, rearranged to:\n\n[ x/(1-2x) ]^(1/3)=2*(3/4)^(1/3).\n\nWait, how did I get that step?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nx^(-1/3) =2*(3/4)^(1/3)*(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nMultiply both sides by (1-2x)^(1/3):\n\nx^(-1/3) * (1-2x)^(1/3) =2*(3/4)^(1/3).\n\nWhich can be written as [ (1-2x)/x ]^(1/3) =2*(3/4)^(1/3).\n\nWait, that's different from what I had earlier. So, I think I made a mistake in the rearrangement step.\n\nWait, let me correct that.\n\nStarting from:\n\nx^(-1/3) =2*(3/4)^(1/3)*(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nMultiply both sides by (1-2x)^(1/3):\n\nx^(-1/3)*(1-2x)^(1/3) =2*(3/4)^(1/3).\n\nWhich is [ (1-2x)/x ]^(1/3) =2*(3/4)^(1/3).\n\nNow, cube both sides:\n\n(1-2x)/x = [2*(3/4)^(1/3)]^3.\n\nCompute the right-hand side:\n\n2^3=8,\n\n(3/4)^(1/3)^3=3/4.\n\nSo, 8*(3/4)=6.\n\nThus, (1-2x)/x=6.\n\nThen, 1-2x=6x.\n\nSo, 1=8x.\n\nThus, x=1/8.\n\nWait, that's different from what I had earlier.\n\nSo, x=1/8.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier result. So, I must have made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nAfter differentiating, I had:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) - (4/3)(3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3)(1-2x)^(-1/3)=0.\n\nThen, moving the second term to the other side:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) = (4/3)(3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3)(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3:\n\n2 x^(-1/3) =4 (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3)(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx^(-1/3)=2*(3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3)*(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nWait, okay, so (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) is (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3). Let's compute that:\n\nsqrt(3)=3^(1/2), so (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3)=3^(1/3)/2^(2/3).\n\nSo, x^(-1/3)=2*(3^(1/3)/2^(2/3))*(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n2*(3^(1/3)/2^(2/3))=2^{1 - 2/3} *3^{1/3}=2^{1/3} *3^{1/3}= (2*3)^{1/3}=6^{1/3}.\n\nSo, right-hand side is 6^{1/3}*(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\nx^(-1/3)=6^{1/3}*(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nMultiply both sides by (1-2x)^(1/3):\n\nx^(-1/3)*(1-2x)^(1/3)=6^{1/3}.\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3:\n\n[ (1-2x)/x ] =6.\n\nSo, (1-2x)/x=6.\n\nWhich leads to 1-2x=6x,\n\n1=8x,\n\nx=1/8.\n\nSo, x=1/8.\n\nWait, that's different from the earlier x=6/13. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, I think the mistake was in the earlier substitution when I considered [ -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3). I had incorrectly factored it as sqrt(3)/2*(1-2x), but perhaps I made an error in the substitution steps.\n\nWait, let's proceed with x=1/8.\n\nThen, y= -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)*( -1/8 +1/2 )=sqrt(3)*(3/8)=3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo, point C would be (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nThen, OC^2= (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2=1/64 + 27/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nBut wait, 7 and 16 are coprime, so p+q=23.\n\nBut that contradicts the earlier result. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, but wait: If x=1/8, then let's check if it lies on AB.\n\nAB is from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). The parametric equation of AB can be written as (1/2 - t/2, 0 + (sqrt(3)/2) t), where t ranges from 0 to1.\n\nSo, when t=1/4, x=1/2 - (1/4)(1/2)=1/2 -1/8=3/8. Hmm, no, that doesn't match x=1/8.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the parametrization.\n\nWait, AB's equation is y= -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, when x=1/8, y= -sqrt(3)/8 + sqrt(3)/2= ( -sqrt(3) +4 sqrt(3) )/8= 3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo, yes, point (1/8,3 sqrt(3)/8) lies on AB.\n\nBut does this point lie on the astroid?\n\nLet's check: x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)= (1/8)^(2/3) + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/8)^(2/3)= (1^(2/3))/(8^(2/3))=1/(4)=1/4.\n\n(3 sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3)= [3^(3/2)/8 ]^(2/3)= [ (3^(3/2))^(2/3) ] / (8^(2/3))= 3^(1) /4= 3/4.\n\nSo, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1/4 +3/4=1. So, yes, it lies on the astroid.\n\nSo, point C is (1/8,3 sqrt(3)/8), which is on both AB and the astroid, and AB is tangent to the astroid at this point.\n\nTherefore, OC^2= (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2=1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nSo, 7/16 is reduced, so p=7, q=16, p+q=23.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the point was (6/13, sqrt(3)/26), but that led to OC^2=147/676, which is 21^2/(26^2 * 1). But that seems inconsistent with the derivative method.\n\nWait, but why the discrepancy? Because in the first approach, I substituted the parametrization and found x=6/13, but in the second approach, using the derivative condition, I found x=1/8.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach when substituting. Let me go back.\n\nIn the first approach, I substituted x=cos^3\u03b8, y=sin^3\u03b8, and then tried to substitute into the line equation. But perhaps that approach was flawed because the astroid is the envelope, so the point C is where the line AB is tangent to the astroid, which is the correct method.\n\nTherefore, the correct point C is at (1/8,3 sqrt(3)/8), leading to OC^2=7/16, so p+q=23.\n\nBut wait, let me check the first approach again.\n\nIn the first approach, I substituted y= -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into the astroid equation, leading to x^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3)=1.\n\nThen, I tried to make a substitution and ended up with x=6/13.\n\nBut when I used the condition that the derivative is zero, I found x=1/8.\n\nSo, perhaps the first approach didn't account for the tangency condition, leading to an extraneous solution.\n\nWait, but when I substituted y into the astroid equation, I should have gotten a single solution because AB is tangent to the astroid, meaning the equation has exactly one solution. So, perhaps my mistake was in the substitution step.\n\nWait, let me substitute x=1/8 into the first equation to see if it holds.\n\nx^(2/3)= (1/8)^(2/3)= (1^(2/3))/(8^(2/3))=1/4.\n\ny=3 sqrt(3)/8,\n\ny^(2/3)= (3 sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3)= [ (3^(3/2) ) /8 ]^(2/3)= (3^(3/2 * 2/3)) / (8^(2/3))=3^(1) /4=3/4.\n\nSo, x^(2/3)+y^(2/3)=1/4 +3/4=1, which is correct.\n\nSo, x=1/8 is a solution. So, perhaps in the first approach, when I set up the substitution, I might have made an algebraic mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first approach didn't account for the fact that the system must have a double root, which is why the derivative method is more accurate.\n\nThus, I think the correct point C is (1/8,3 sqrt(3)/8), leading to OC^2=7/16, so p+q=23.\n\nBut wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, in the first approach, when I substituted y into the astroid equation, I ended up with x=6/13, which gave OC^2=147/676. But when I used the envelope condition, I found x=1/8, OC^2=7/16.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nWait, I think the mistake in the first approach was that I assumed the equation would have only one solution, but perhaps I didn't properly account for the multiplicity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first approach is flawed because substituting y into the astroid equation without considering the parametrization can lead to multiple solutions, only one of which is the point of tangency.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is using the derivative condition, which gives x=1/8, leading to OC^2=7/16.\n\nThus, the answer is 7+16=23.\n\nBut wait, but in the problem statement, it says that C is on AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB.\n\nSo, if AB is tangent to the astroid at C, then C is the only point on AB that lies on any PQ from F, which is AB itself. All other points on AB would lie on other PQ segments as well, except for C.\n\nWait, but if AB is a segment in F, then all points on AB are on PQ=AB. But the problem says that C does not belong to any other segment from F, meaning that C is only on AB and no other PQ.\n\nThus, perhaps the point where AB is tangent to the envelope is the only point on AB that isn't on any other PQ.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is OC^2=7/16, leading to p+q=23.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it out step by step. \n\nWe have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between O and (1,0), and B is on the y-axis a bit above (0, 1), since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. \n\nThe family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment from some point P(p,0) on the x-axis to some point Q(0,q) on the y-axis, such that the distance between P and Q is 1. So, sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1, right? That means p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, all such segments PQ lie in the first quadrant and have length 1.\n\nNow, the problem says there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, we need to find this point C on AB such that no other PQ in F passes through C except for AB itself.\n\nOur goal is to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, then find p + q.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the setup.\n\nFirst, let's write the equation of line AB. Points A and B are given, so let's find the slope of AB. The slope m is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the line AB has a slope of -sqrt(3).\n\nSince it passes through point A (1/2, 0), the equation of AB can be written using point-slope form: y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, any point C on AB can be parameterized as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) for x between 0 and 1/2, I think. Wait, when x = 1/2, y is 0, which is point A. When x = 0, y is sqrt(3)/2, which is point B. So yes, x ranges from 0 to 1/2 along AB.\n\nWe need to find a point C on AB such that it's not on any other segment PQ in F except for AB itself. So, suppose there exists another segment PQ (different from AB) such that C lies on PQ. But we need C to lie only on AB and no other PQ in F.\n\nSo, our aim is to find C on AB where for no other P and Q on the axes with PQ of length 1, does C lie on PQ.\n\nAlternatively, for any other segment PQ (other than AB), C is not on PQ.\n\nWait, but how do we characterize all such PQ segments?\n\nEach PQ is a line from (p,0) to (0,q), where p^2 + q^2 =1, and p, q >0 since they're in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, the equation of the line PQ can be written as x/p + y/q =1, right? Because it's intercept form.\n\nSo, the line PQ is x/p + y/q =1, with p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nNow, if point C is on AB, which has the equation y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, and C is also on PQ, which is x/p + y/q =1.\n\nSo, for C to lie on both AB and PQ, the coordinates of C must satisfy both equations.\n\nSo, substituting y from AB into PQ's equation:\n\nx/p + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)/q = 1.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\nx/p - (sqrt(3) x)/q + (sqrt(3)/2)/q =1.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nx (1/p - sqrt(3)/q) + (sqrt(3)/(2q)) = 1.\n\nSo, this is an equation in terms of x. For this equation to hold, it must be true for the x-coordinate of point C on AB.\n\nBut since we want point C to lie only on AB and no other PQ, except for AB itself, we need to ensure that for all other PQ in F, this equation doesn't hold for the same C. \n\nWait, but how do we ensure that? Maybe if the system of equations for AB and PQ has a solution only when PQ is AB itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize point C on AB and find conditions on C such that the only PQ that passes through it is AB.\n\nWait, but AB is one of the PQ segments in F, right? Because AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's check if AB is indeed a segment in F.\n\nThe length of AB is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) =1. So yes, AB is in F because its length is 1, and P is on x-axis, Q on y-axis.\n\nSo, for point C on AB, if we can find a condition such that when we set up the equation x/p + y/q =1, with p^2 + q^2=1, the only solution is when p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2, which corresponds to AB itself.\n\nTherefore, for point C on AB, except A and B, we need that for any other p and q with p^2 + q^2=1, the equation x/p + y/q =1 does not hold.\n\nSo, perhaps for point C on AB, the equation x/p + y/q =1 has exactly one solution (p,q) which is (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, for other (p,q), the equation doesn't hold.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure that? Maybe by finding C such that the system of equations has only one solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize point C as (t, -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2) for t between 0 and 1/2.\n\nThen, substitute into the PQ equation x/p + y/q =1:\n\nt/p + (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2)/q =1.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nt/p - (sqrt(3) t)/q + sqrt(3)/(2 q) =1.\n\nLet me factor t:\n\nt(1/p - sqrt(3)/q) + sqrt(3)/(2 q) =1.\n\nNow, since p^2 + q^2 =1, we can parametrize p and q as p=cos(theta), q=sin(theta), since p and q are positive in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, let me let p = cos(theta), q = sin(theta), where theta is between 0 and pi/2.\n\nThen, substituting into the equation:\n\nt (1/cos(theta) - sqrt(3)/sin(theta)) + sqrt(3)/(2 sin(theta)) =1.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nt ( (sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta)) / (sin(theta) cos(theta)) ) + sqrt(3)/(2 sin(theta)) =1.\n\nSimplify the first term:\n\nt ( sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta) ) / ( sin(theta) cos(theta) ) + sqrt(3)/(2 sin(theta)) =1.\n\nMultiply both sides by sin(theta) cos(theta) to eliminate denominators:\n\nt ( sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta) ) + (sqrt(3)/2 cos(theta)) = sin(theta) cos(theta).\n\nNow, let's rearrange terms:\n\nt ( sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta) ) = sin(theta) cos(theta) - (sqrt(3)/2) cos(theta).\n\nFactor out cos(theta) on the right-hand side:\n\nt ( sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta) ) = cos(theta) [ sin(theta) - sqrt(3)/2 ].\n\nSo, we have:\n\nt = [ cos(theta) ( sin(theta) - sqrt(3)/2 ) ] / ( sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta) ).\n\nNow, for a given theta, t is given by this expression. But we want that for the point C on AB, this equation holds only when theta corresponds to the PQ being AB itself.\n\nAB corresponds to p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2, which is theta=60 degrees, since cos(theta)=1/2, sin(theta)=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, theta=pi/3.\n\nTherefore, we need that for all other theta, the equation does not hold for the same t. Hmm, but how does that help?\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of this as, for each theta, there's a t such that point C is on PQ(theta). But we want that for only theta=pi/3, the point C is on PQ(theta). For all other theta, no such C exists on AB except AB itself.\n\nWait, no. Actually, for any theta, the PQ(theta) is a line from (cos(theta),0) to (0,sin(theta)). So, it's a line that might intersect AB at some point C. But we want only the AB segment itself to pass through C, and no other PQ(theta). So, point C should not lie on any other PQ(theta) except AB.\n\nSo, perhaps the point C is such that when we solve for t in terms of theta, the equation has only one solution for theta, which is theta=pi/3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation for t can be solved for theta, and we can find the values of t where the equation has a unique solution for theta.\n\nWait, that might be the way to go. Let's suppose that t is such that the equation has only one solution for theta, which would mean that the equation is tangent to AB at C, making it the only point where PQ(theta) touches AB except at A and B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can set up the system so that the equation has only one solution for theta, meaning that the discriminant is zero.\n\nBut this is getting a bit abstract. Maybe another approach.\n\nLet me consider point C on AB, so C is (t, -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2). We want that this point C does not lie on any other PQ in F except for AB itself.\n\nSo, if we suppose that C lies on another PQ in F, then the equation x/p + y/q =1 must hold, with p^2 + q^2=1, and (p,q) not equal to (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSo, let's set up the equations:\n\nt/p + (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2)/q =1.\n\nAnd p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nWe can think of this as a system of equations in variables p and q. We want that this system has only one solution, which is p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, for the point C, the system:\n\n1. t/p + (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2)/q =1\n\n2. p^2 + q^2=1\n\nShould have exactly one solution (p,q)=(1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, any other solution would mean that another PQ passes through C, which we don't want. So, we need that this system has only one solution.\n\nSo, perhaps the system is such that it's only satisfied when p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2. So, how can we enforce that?\n\nLet me try to manipulate the first equation.\n\nLet me denote equation 1 as:\n\nt/p + ( - sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ) / q = 1.\n\nLet me denote equation 2 as p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nLet me write equation 1 as:\n\n(t q + (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2) p ) / (p q) =1.\n\nWhich implies:\n\nt q + (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2) p = p q.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nt q - sqrt(3) t p + (sqrt(3)/2) p - p q =0.\n\nFactor terms:\n\nt q - sqrt(3) t p + (sqrt(3)/2) p - p q =0.\n\nWait, perhaps factor p and q:\n\np ( - sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 - q ) + q t =0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express q from equation 2 in terms of p and substitute into equation 1.\n\nFrom equation 2: q = sqrt(1 - p^2). Since q>0, we can write q = sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\nt/p + (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2)/sqrt(1 - p^2) =1.\n\nThis looks complicated, but maybe we can square both sides to eliminate the square root. But squaring can introduce extraneous solutions, so we have to be careful.\n\nLet me denote equation 1 as:\n\nt/p + [ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ] / sqrt(1 - p^2) =1.\n\nLet me denote A = t/p, and B = [ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ] / sqrt(1 - p^2). So, equation 1 is A + B =1.\n\nBut perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, let me move one term to the other side:\n\nt/p =1 - [ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ] / sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nThen, square both sides:\n\n(t/p)^2 = [1 - ( -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ) / sqrt(1 - p^2) ]^2.\n\nThis seems messy, but let's proceed.\n\nLet me denote C = ( -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ) / sqrt(1 - p^2).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(t/p)^2 = (1 - C)^2.\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\n(t/p)^2 =1 - 2 C + C^2.\n\nNow, substitute back C:\n\n(t/p)^2 =1 - 2 [ (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ) / sqrt(1 - p^2) ] + [ (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 )^2 ] / (1 - p^2).\n\nThis is getting quite involved. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that for point C, the only PQ passing through it is AB. So, the line AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. Maybe C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of all PQ segments in F.\n\nWhat's the envelope of the family F?\n\nThe envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family F at some point. So, if we can find the envelope of all PQ segments, then the point C where AB is tangent to this envelope is the unique point that lies only on AB and no other PQ.\n\nSo, let's try to find the envelope of the family F.\n\nEach PQ is given by the line x/p + y/q =1, with p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nTo find the envelope, we can use the method of solving for the condition that a point (x,y) lies on the line x/p + y/q =1 and also satisfies the derivative condition for the envelope.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the method where we treat p and q as parameters related by p^2 + q^2=1, and then find the envelope by eliminating p and q.\n\nWait, let me think. For the envelope, we can consider F(x,y,p,q) = x/p + y/q -1 =0, and the constraint G(p,q)=p^2 + q^2 -1=0.\n\nThen, the envelope satisfies F=0 and dF/dp =0 and dF/dq=0? Wait, no. The envelope is found by solving F=0 along with dF/d\u03bb=0, where \u03bb is a parameter. But in this case, we have a constraint between p and q.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize p and q in terms of a single parameter \u03b8, as I did earlier: p=cos\u03b8, q=sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, the line equation becomes x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nTo find the envelope, we can take the derivative with respect to \u03b8 and set it to zero, along with the original equation.\n\nSo, let's compute d/d\u03b8 (x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 -1) =0.\n\nCompute derivative:\n\nd/d\u03b8 (x/cos\u03b8) = x sin\u03b8 / cos^2\u03b8,\n\nd/d\u03b8 (y/sin\u03b8) = - y cos\u03b8 / sin^2\u03b8,\n\nSo, the derivative is:\n\n(x sin\u03b8)/cos^2\u03b8 - (y cos\u03b8)/sin^2\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo, (x sin\u03b8)/cos^2\u03b8 = (y cos\u03b8)/sin^2\u03b8.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\nx sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8.\n\nSo, x sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8.\n\nBut from the original line equation:\n\nx/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me write that as x = cos\u03b8 (1 - y/sin\u03b8).\n\nSubstitute into x sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8:\n\n[ cos\u03b8 (1 - y/sin\u03b8) ] sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8.\n\nSimplify:\n\ncos\u03b8 (1 - y/sin\u03b8) sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8.\n\nDivide both sides by cos\u03b8 (assuming cos\u03b8 \u22600):\n\n(1 - y/sin\u03b8) sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^2\u03b8.\n\nExpand the left-hand side:\n\nsin^3\u03b8 - y sin^2\u03b8 = y cos^2\u03b8.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nsin^3\u03b8 = y (sin^2\u03b8 + cos^2\u03b8).\n\nBut sin^2\u03b8 + cos^2\u03b8=1, so:\n\nsin^3\u03b8 = y.\n\nThus, y = sin^3\u03b8.\n\nFrom the original line equation, x = cos\u03b8 (1 - y/sin\u03b8).\n\nSubstitute y = sin^3\u03b8:\n\nx = cos\u03b8 (1 - sin^3\u03b8 / sin\u03b8 ) = cos\u03b8 (1 - sin^2\u03b8 ) = cos\u03b8 cos^2\u03b8 = cos^3\u03b8.\n\nSo, the envelope is given parametrically by x=cos^3\u03b8, y=sin^3\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nWait, because if x=cos^3\u03b8, y=sin^3\u03b8, then x^(2/3)=cos^2\u03b8, y^(2/3)=sin^2\u03b8, so x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1. Exactly, so the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nSo, the envelope is the astroid, and the line AB is tangent to this astroid at point C.\n\nTherefore, point C lies on both AB and the astroid, and AB is tangent to the astroid at C.\n\nSo, to find point C, we can find the point of tangency between line AB and the astroid.\n\nSo, let's write the equation of the astroid: x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nAnd the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe can substitute y from AB into the astroid equation and find the point(s) of intersection.\n\nBut since AB is tangent to the astroid, there should be exactly one point of intersection, which is point C.\n\nWait, but wait: AB is a line of the family F itself, right? Because AB is a segment in F, so it's one of the PQs.\n\nBut the envelope is the astroid, which is tangent to each PQ in F. So, AB is tangent to the astroid at point C.\n\nTherefore, substituting y from AB into the astroid equation, we should get a system that has exactly one solution, which is point C.\n\nSo, let's substitute y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nLet me write that:\n\nx^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) =1.\n\nThis looks a bit messy, but perhaps we can make a substitution.\n\nLet me denote t = x^(1/3), so x = t^3.\n\nSimilarly, let me compute y:\n\ny = -sqrt(3) t^3 + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, y = sqrt(3) ( -t^3 + 1/2 ).\n\nThen, y^(2/3) = [ sqrt(3) ( -t^3 + 1/2 ) ]^(2/3 ) = [3^(1/2) (1/2 - t^3) ]^(2/3 ) = 3^(1/3) (1/2 - t^3)^(2/3).\n\nSo, the astroid equation becomes:\n\nt^2 + 3^(1/3) (1/2 - t^3)^(2/3) =1.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but maybe we can find a value of t that satisfies this equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better substitution or method.\n\nWait, perhaps since AB is tangent to the astroid at C, the system of equations (astroid and AB) has exactly one solution, which is C. So, we can solve for x and y.\n\nLet me write the astroid equation as:\n\nx^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nAnd AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSubstitute y into the astroid equation:\n\nx^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) =1.\n\nLet me factor sqrt(3)/2 from the second term inside the brackets:\n\n[ sqrt(3)/2 ( -2x +1 ) ].\n\nSo, [ -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ] = sqrt(3)/2 (1 - 2x).\n\nThus, [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) = [ sqrt(3)/2 (1 - 2x) ]^(2/3 ) = (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3) * (1 - 2x)^(2/3).\n\nCompute (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3):\n\nsqrt(3) is 3^(1/2), so (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) = 3^(1/3) / 2^(2/3).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nx^(2/3) + [ 3^(1/3) / 2^(2/3) ] * (1 - 2x)^(2/3) =1.\n\nLet me denote k = 3^(1/3) / 2^(2/3), which is a constant.\n\nSo, equation is:\n\nx^(2/3) + k (1 - 2x)^(2/3) =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can let u = x^(1/3), so x = u^3, and 1 - 2x =1 - 2u^3.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\nu^2 + k (1 - 2u^3)^(2/3) =1.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can make a substitution such as z = x^(1/3), but I'm not seeing a clear path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that since AB is tangent to the astroid, the system has a double root, so the equation will have a repeated solution. So, perhaps we can set up the equation to have a double root.\n\nLet me denote f(x) = x^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) -1 =0.\n\nFor AB to be tangent to the astroid, f(x) =0 must have a double root, so f(x)=0 and f\u2019(x)=0.\n\nSo, we can set f(x)=0 and f\u2019(x)=0 and solve for x.\n\nBut f(x) is a bit complicated to differentiate, but let's try.\n\nFirst, f(x) = x^(2/3) + [ sqrt(3)/2 (1 - 2x) ]^(2/3) -1.\n\nLet me write f(x) as:\n\nf(x) = x^(2/3) + (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) (1 - 2x)^(2/3) -1.\n\nLet me compute the derivative f\u2019(x):\n\nf\u2019(x) = (2/3) x^(-1/3) + (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) * (2/3) (1 - 2x)^(-1/3) * (-2).\n\nSimplify:\n\nf\u2019(x) = (2/3) x^(-1/3) - (4/3) (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) (1 - 2x)^(-1/3).\n\nNow, at the point of tangency, f(x)=0 and f\u2019(x)=0.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. x^(2/3) + (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) (1 - 2x)^(2/3) =1.\n\n2. (2/3) x^(-1/3) - (4/3) (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) (1 - 2x)^(-1/3) =0.\n\nLet me denote equation 2 as:\n\n(2/3) x^(-1/3) = (4/3) (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) (1 - 2x)^(-1/3).\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators:\n\n2 x^(-1/3) =4 (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) (1 - 2x)^(-1/3).\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx^(-1/3) =2 (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) (1 - 2x)^(-1/3).\n\nLet me write 3^(1/2)/2 as (3/4)^(1/2), so (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) = (3/4)^(1/3).\n\nSo, x^(-1/3) = 2*(3/4)^(1/3) * (1 - 2x)^(-1/3).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nx^(-1/3) = 2*(3/4)^(1/3) * (1 - 2x)^(-1/3).\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n[ x / (1 - 2x) ]^(1/3) = 2*(3/4)^(1/3).\n\nCube both sides:\n\nx / (1 - 2x) = [ 2*(3/4)^(1/3) ]^3.\n\nCompute the right-hand side:\n\n[2]^3 * [ (3/4)^(1/3) ]^3 =8 * (3/4) = 8*(3/4)=6.\n\nSo, x/(1 - 2x)=6.\n\nSolve for x:\n\nx =6(1 - 2x).\n\nx =6 -12x.\n\nBring terms together:\n\nx +12x=6.\n\n13x=6.\n\nx=6/13.\n\nSo, x=6/13. Now, let's find y from the equation of AB:\n\ny= -sqrt(3)*(6/13) + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nCompute:\n\ny= sqrt(3)*(-6/13 +1/2 )= sqrt(3)*(-12/26 +13/26 )= sqrt(3)*(1/26)= sqrt(3)/26.\n\nSo, point C is (6/13, sqrt(3)/26).\n\nTherefore, OC^2 is (6/13)^2 + (sqrt(3)/26)^2.\n\nCompute:\n\n(36/169) + (3)/(676).\n\nConvert to same denominator:\n\n36/169 = 144/676.\n\nSo, 144/676 +3/676=147/676.\n\nSimplify 147 and 676: 147=49*3, 676=4*169=4*13^2. No common factors, so 147/676 is reduced.\n\nTherefore, OC^2=147/676. So p=147, q=676.\n\nWait, but let me check if 147 and 676 are coprime.\n\n147 factors: 3 * 49 =3 *7^2.\n\n676 factors: 26^2= (2*13)^2=2^2 *13^2.\n\nSo, no common prime factors. So yes, 147/676 is reduced.\n\nTherefore, p+q=147+676=823.\n\nWait, but before I get too confident, let me verify my steps because this seems a bit involved.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Found that AB is a segment in F, which is correct because its length is 1.\n\n2. Recognized that the envelope of F is the astroid x^(2/3)+y^(2/3)=1.\n\n3. Since AB is tangent to the astroid at C, we set up the system of equations for the astroid and AB, and using the condition that the derivative is zero (tangency), solved for x and y.\n\n4. Found x=6/13, y=sqrt(3)/26.\n\n5. Calculated OC^2 as (6/13)^2 + (sqrt(3)/26)^2=36/169 +3/676= (144 +3)/676=147/676.\n\n6. Reduced fraction is 147/676, sum is 147+676=823.\n\nWait, but let me check the derivative step again because that's where it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nIn equation 2, after differentiation, I had:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) - (4/3)(3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3)(1-2x)^(-1/3) =0.\n\nI moved the second term to the other side:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) = (4/3)(3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3)(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nThen, multiplied both sides by 3:\n\n2 x^(-1/3) =4 (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3)(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nDivided by 2:\n\nx^(-1/3)=2 (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) (1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nWait, that step seems correct.\n\nThen, I wrote (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) as (3/4)^(1/3), which is correct because (sqrt(3)/2)^2 =3/4, so (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3) = (3/4)^(1/3).\n\nThen, I wrote:\n\nx^(-1/3) =2*(3/4)^(1/3)*(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nThen, rearranged to:\n\n[ x/(1-2x) ]^(1/3)=2*(3/4)^(1/3).\n\nWait, how did I get that step?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nx^(-1/3) =2*(3/4)^(1/3)*(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nMultiply both sides by (1-2x)^(1/3):\n\nx^(-1/3) * (1-2x)^(1/3) =2*(3/4)^(1/3).\n\nWhich can be written as [ (1-2x)/x ]^(1/3) =2*(3/4)^(1/3).\n\nWait, that's different from what I had earlier. So, I think I made a mistake in the rearrangement step.\n\nWait, let me correct that.\n\nStarting from:\n\nx^(-1/3) =2*(3/4)^(1/3)*(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nMultiply both sides by (1-2x)^(1/3):\n\nx^(-1/3)*(1-2x)^(1/3) =2*(3/4)^(1/3).\n\nWhich is [ (1-2x)/x ]^(1/3) =2*(3/4)^(1/3).\n\nNow, cube both sides:\n\n(1-2x)/x = [2*(3/4)^(1/3)]^3.\n\nCompute the right-hand side:\n\n2^3=8,\n\n(3/4)^(1/3)^3=3/4.\n\nSo, 8*(3/4)=6.\n\nThus, (1-2x)/x=6.\n\nThen, 1-2x=6x.\n\nSo, 1=8x.\n\nThus, x=1/8.\n\nWait, that's different from what I had earlier.\n\nSo, x=1/8.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier result. So, I must have made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nAfter differentiating, I had:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) - (4/3)(3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3)(1-2x)^(-1/3)=0.\n\nThen, moving the second term to the other side:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) = (4/3)(3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3)(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3:\n\n2 x^(-1/3) =4 (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3)(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx^(-1/3)=2*(3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3)*(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nWait, okay, so (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) is (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3). Let's compute that:\n\nsqrt(3)=3^(1/2), so (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3)=3^(1/3)/2^(2/3).\n\nSo, x^(-1/3)=2*(3^(1/3)/2^(2/3))*(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n2*(3^(1/3)/2^(2/3))=2^{1 - 2/3} *3^{1/3}=2^{1/3} *3^{1/3}= (2*3)^{1/3}=6^{1/3}.\n\nSo, right-hand side is 6^{1/3}*(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\nx^(-1/3)=6^{1/3}*(1-2x)^(-1/3).\n\nMultiply both sides by (1-2x)^(1/3):\n\nx^(-1/3)*(1-2x)^(1/3)=6^{1/3}.\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3:\n\n[ (1-2x)/x ] =6.\n\nSo, (1-2x)/x=6.\n\nWhich leads to 1-2x=6x,\n\n1=8x,\n\nx=1/8.\n\nSo, x=1/8.\n\nWait, that's different from the earlier x=6/13. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, I think the mistake was in the earlier substitution when I considered [ -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3). I had incorrectly factored it as sqrt(3)/2*(1-2x), but perhaps I made an error in the substitution steps.\n\nWait, let's proceed with x=1/8.\n\nThen, y= -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)*( -1/8 +1/2 )=sqrt(3)*(3/8)=3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo, point C would be (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nThen, OC^2= (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2=1/64 + 27/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nBut wait, 7 and 16 are coprime, so p+q=23.\n\nBut that contradicts the earlier result. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, but wait: If x=1/8, then let's check if it lies on AB.\n\nAB is from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). The parametric equation of AB can be written as (1/2 - t/2, 0 + (sqrt(3)/2) t), where t ranges from 0 to1.\n\nSo, when t=1/4, x=1/2 - (1/4)(1/2)=1/2 -1/8=3/8. Hmm, no, that doesn't match x=1/8.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the parametrization.\n\nWait, AB's equation is y= -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, when x=1/8, y= -sqrt(3)/8 + sqrt(3)/2= ( -sqrt(3) +4 sqrt(3) )/8= 3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo, yes, point (1/8,3 sqrt(3)/8) lies on AB.\n\nBut does this point lie on the astroid?\n\nLet's check: x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)= (1/8)^(2/3) + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/8)^(2/3)= (1^(2/3))/(8^(2/3))=1/(4)=1/4.\n\n(3 sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3)= [3^(3/2)/8 ]^(2/3)= [ (3^(3/2))^(2/3) ] / (8^(2/3))= 3^(1) /4= 3/4.\n\nSo, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1/4 +3/4=1. So, yes, it lies on the astroid.\n\nSo, point C is (1/8,3 sqrt(3)/8), which is on both AB and the astroid, and AB is tangent to the astroid at this point.\n\nTherefore, OC^2= (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2=1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nSo, 7/16 is reduced, so p=7, q=16, p+q=23.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the point was (6/13, sqrt(3)/26), but that led to OC^2=147/676, which is 21^2/(26^2 * 1). But that seems inconsistent with the derivative method.\n\nWait, but why the discrepancy? Because in the first approach, I substituted the parametrization and found x=6/13, but in the second approach, using the derivative condition, I found x=1/8.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach when substituting. Let me go back.\n\nIn the first approach, I substituted x=cos^3\u03b8, y=sin^3\u03b8, and then tried to substitute into the line equation. But perhaps that approach was flawed because the astroid is the envelope, so the point C is where the line AB is tangent to the astroid, which is the correct method.\n\nTherefore, the correct point C is at (1/8,3 sqrt(3)/8), leading to OC^2=7/16, so p+q=23.\n\nBut wait, let me check the first approach again.\n\nIn the first approach, I substituted y= -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into the astroid equation, leading to x^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3)=1.\n\nThen, I tried to make a substitution and ended up with x=6/13.\n\nBut when I used the condition that the derivative is zero, I found x=1/8.\n\nSo, perhaps the first approach didn't account for the tangency condition, leading to an extraneous solution.\n\nWait, but when I substituted y into the astroid equation, I should have gotten a single solution because AB is tangent to the astroid, meaning the equation has exactly one solution. So, perhaps my mistake was in the substitution step.\n\nWait, let me substitute x=1/8 into the first equation to see if it holds.\n\nx^(2/3)= (1/8)^(2/3)= (1^(2/3))/(8^(2/3))=1/4.\n\ny=3 sqrt(3)/8,\n\ny^(2/3)= (3 sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3)= [ (3^(3/2) ) /8 ]^(2/3)= (3^(3/2 * 2/3)) / (8^(2/3))=3^(1) /4=3/4.\n\nSo, x^(2/3)+y^(2/3)=1/4 +3/4=1, which is correct.\n\nSo, x=1/8 is a solution. So, perhaps in the first approach, when I set up the substitution, I might have made an algebraic mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first approach didn't account for the fact that the system must have a double root, which is why the derivative method is more accurate.\n\nThus, I think the correct point C is (1/8,3 sqrt(3)/8), leading to OC^2=7/16, so p+q=23.\n\nBut wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, in the first approach, when I substituted y into the astroid equation, I ended up with x=6/13, which gave OC^2=147/676. But when I used the envelope condition, I found x=1/8, OC^2=7/16.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nWait, I think the mistake in the first approach was that I assumed the equation would have only one solution, but perhaps I didn't properly account for the multiplicity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first approach is flawed because substituting y into the astroid equation without considering the parametrization can lead to multiple solutions, only one of which is the point of tangency.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is using the derivative condition, which gives x=1/8, leading to OC^2=7/16.\n\nThus, the answer is 7+16=23.\n\nBut wait, but in the problem statement, it says that C is on AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB.\n\nSo, if AB is tangent to the astroid at C, then C is the only point on AB that lies on any PQ from F, which is AB itself. All other points on AB would lie on other PQ segments as well, except for C.\n\nWait, but if AB is a segment in F, then all points on AB are on PQ=AB. But the problem says that C does not belong to any other segment from F, meaning that C is only on AB and no other PQ.\n\nThus, perhaps the point where AB is tangent to the envelope is the only point on AB that isn't on any other PQ.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is OC^2=7/16, leading to p+q=23.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the given points and the family of segments.

Let me try to parse all the given information and figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the points O, A, and B are given as O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between O and (1,0), and B is on the y-axis a bit higher than (0,1), since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.\n\nThe family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ has endpoints on the axes, is of length 1, and is in the first quadrant. So, for example, if I take a point P on the x-axis at (a,0), then Q must be somewhere on the y-axis such that the distance between (a,0) and (0,b) is 1. So, the equation would be sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 1, which means a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1.\n\nBut since P is on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, each segment PQ is a line from (a,0) to (0,b) where a and b satisfy a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1. So, these are like points on the unit circle, but in the first quadrant, connected by line segments.\n\nNow, the problem says that there is a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, AB is one of these segments, right? Because AB is from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the length of AB. The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So yes, AB is a member of F, since it's a segment of unit length from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, AB is one of these PQ segments. The other segments in F are all other possible PQ segments of unit length from x-axis to y-axis in the first quadrant. So, each such segment is a line connecting (a,0) to (0,b) where a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1.\n\nNow, the point C is on AB, but not on any other segment from F except AB. So, it's the only point on AB that isn't intersected by any other segment in F. So, our task is to find such a point C on AB, compute OC\u00b2, and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p+q.\n\nI think the key is to find the point C on AB such that no other segment PQ in F passes through C. So, C is the unique point where only AB passes through it among all the segments in F.\n\nTo find C, perhaps we can parametrize AB and then find the point on AB that isn't on any other PQ in F.\n\nFirst, let's parametrize AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the line AB can be parametrized as:\n\nx = 1/2 - (1/2)t\n\ny = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t\n\nwhere t ranges from 0 to 1. So, when t=0, we are at A, and when t=1, we are at B.\n\nSo, any point C on AB can be written as (1/2 - t/2, (sqrt(3)/2) t) for some t between 0 and 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the point C on AB such that there's no other segment PQ in F (other than AB itself) that passes through C.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that for C to not lie on any other PQ segment in F, the line PQ (other than AB) cannot pass through C. So, for all other PQ segments in F, the line PQ does not pass through C.\n\nAlternatively, for the point C, the only line PQ in F that passes through it is AB.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the point C is such that the tangent from C to the unit circle is somehow related, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the point where AB is the only such segment that passes through it, meaning that for any other PQ in F, the line PQ does not pass through C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point C is the point on AB where the distance from C to the origin is minimized or maximized? Or perhaps it's the point where the derivative or some geometric condition is met.\n\nWait, another approach is to consider that for a point C on AB, if there exists another segment PQ in F that passes through C, then C would lie on both AB and PQ. So, for C to be unique to AB, there must be no such PQ in F (other than AB) passing through C.\n\nSo, perhaps the idea is to find C on AB such that the equation of line AB and the equation of some other PQ in F do not intersect except at C.\n\nWait, but how can we ensure that? Maybe we can consider that for point C, the lines PQ in F other than AB do not pass through it. So, perhaps we can find the envelope of all such lines PQ in F and find where AB intersects this envelope. The point C would be the point where AB is tangent to this envelope, so that it only touches at one point, meaning no other PQ passes through C.\n\nWait, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, if we can find the envelope of all segments PQ in F, then AB may intersect this envelope at point C, which is the only point where AB touches the envelope, meaning that beyond that point, AB doesn't intersect any other PQ in F.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the envelope is a curve that touches each PQ at one point, and AB is tangent to this envelope at C, so C is the point where AB just touches the envelope, and beyond that, AB doesn't intersect any other PQ.\n\nHmm, I'm not too sure, but let me try to think about the equations.\n\nEach PQ segment is a line from (a,0) to (0,b) with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, the equation of the line PQ is x/a + y/b = 1.\n\nBecause the intercepts are (a,0) and (0,b), so the equation is x/a + y/b = 1.\n\nSince a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1, we can write this as x/a + y/b = 1, with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1.\n\nSo, the family of lines is x/a + y/b = 1, where a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe can parametrize a and b using an angle \u03b8, perhaps. Let me set a = cos\u03b8 and b = sin\u03b8, since a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1.\n\nWait, but in that case, a and b are positive because we are in the first quadrant, so \u03b8 would be between 0 and \u03c0/2.\n\nSo, the equation of each PQ line is x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 = 1.\n\nSo, the family of lines is x sec\u03b8 + y csc\u03b8 =1.\n\nNow, the envelope of this family of lines can be found by solving for \u03b8 the system:\n\nx sec\u03b8 + y csc\u03b8 = 1\n\nand\n\nd/d\u03b8 (x sec\u03b8 + y csc\u03b8) = 0\n\nSo, the derivative with respect to \u03b8 is x sec\u03b8 tan\u03b8 - y csc\u03b8 cot\u03b8 = 0.\n\nSo, let's compute that:\n\nd/d\u03b8 (x sec\u03b8 + y csc\u03b8) = x sec\u03b8 tan\u03b8 - y csc\u03b8 cot\u03b8 = 0.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) x sec\u03b8 + y csc\u03b8 = 1\n\n2) x sec\u03b8 tan\u03b8 - y csc\u03b8 cot\u03b8 = 0\n\nLet me write these more simply.\n\nEquation 1: x sec\u03b8 + y csc\u03b8 = 1\n\nEquation 2: x sec\u03b8 tan\u03b8 = y csc\u03b8 cot\u03b8\n\nLet me express everything in terms of sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8.\n\nEquation 1: x / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 = 1\n\nEquation 2: x / cos\u03b8 * (sin\u03b8 / cos\u03b8) = y / sin\u03b8 * (cos\u03b8 / sin\u03b8)\n\nSimplify equation 2:\n\nLeft side: x sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8\n\nRight side: y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes:\n\nx sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 = y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\nx sin\u00b3\u03b8 = y cos\u00b3\u03b8\n\nSo, x sin\u00b3\u03b8 = y cos\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nLet me solve equation 1 for x:\n\nx = (1 - y / sin\u03b8) cos\u03b8\n\n= cos\u03b8 - y cot\u03b8\n\nNow, substitute x into equation 2:\n\n[cos\u03b8 - y cot\u03b8] sin\u00b3\u03b8 = y cos\u00b3\u03b8\n\nExpand the left side:\n\ncos\u03b8 sin\u00b3\u03b8 - y cot\u03b8 sin\u00b3\u03b8 = y cos\u00b3\u03b8\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: cos\u03b8 sin\u00b3\u03b8\n\nSecond term: y cot\u03b8 sin\u00b3\u03b8 = y (cos\u03b8/sin\u03b8) sin\u00b3\u03b8 = y cos\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\ncos\u03b8 sin\u00b3\u03b8 - y cos\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = y cos\u00b3\u03b8\n\nLet's collect terms with y:\n\n- y cos\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - y cos\u00b3\u03b8 = - cos\u03b8 sin\u00b3\u03b8\n\nFactor out y on the left:\n\ny (-cos\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - cos\u00b3\u03b8) = - cos\u03b8 sin\u00b3\u03b8\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\ny (cos\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b3\u03b8) = cos\u03b8 sin\u00b3\u03b8\n\nFactor cos\u03b8 on the left:\n\ny cos\u03b8 (sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8) = cos\u03b8 sin\u00b3\u03b8\n\nBut sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 = 1, so:\n\ny cos\u03b8 * 1 = cos\u03b8 sin\u00b3\u03b8\n\nDivide both sides by cos\u03b8 (assuming cos\u03b8 \u22600, which it is since we're in the first quadrant):\n\ny = sin\u00b3\u03b8\n\nSimilarly, from equation 1, x = cos\u03b8 - y cot\u03b8 = cos\u03b8 - sin\u00b3\u03b8 * (cos\u03b8 / sin\u03b8) = cos\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 cos\u03b8 = cos\u03b8 (1 - sin\u00b2\u03b8) = cos\u03b8 cos\u00b2\u03b8 = cos\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nSo, x = cos\u00b3\u03b8 and y = sin\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, the envelope is the parametric curve x = cos\u00b3\u03b8, y = sin\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nThis is known as the astroid curve. The envelope of the family of lines x sec\u03b8 + y csc\u03b8 =1 is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nSo, the envelope is the astroid given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nNow, the point C is on AB and is the point where AB is tangent to this astroid. Because AB is one of the lines in the family F, and the envelope is the astroid, so AB will be tangent to the astroid at point C.\n\nWait, but AB itself is a line in F, so it should be tangent to the envelope at point C, which is the only point where AB meets the envelope. So, the point C is the point of tangency on AB with the astroid.\n\nSo, to find C, we need to find where AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nSo, let's find the equation of AB and find its point of tangency with the astroid.\n\nFirst, let's find the equation of AB.\n\nPoints A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nThe slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + c.\n\nTo find c, plug in point A: x=1/2, y=0.\n\n0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c \u2192 c = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nNow, the astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nWe need to find the point C on AB where AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nSo, to find the point of tangency, we can solve the system:\n\n1) y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2\n\n2) x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1\n\nAdditionally, the derivatives at point C for both AB and the astroid should be equal.\n\nAlternatively, since AB is a straight line, and the astroid is a curve, the condition for tangency is that the line AB touches the astroid at exactly one point.\n\nBut perhaps using calculus would be more straightforward.\n\nLet me compute the derivative of the astroid.\n\nGiven x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to x:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx = 0\n\nSo, dy/dx = - [ (x^(-1/3)) / (y^(-1/3)) ) ] = - (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3))\n\nSo, the slope of the astroid at any point (x, y) is - (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3))\n\nNow, the slope of AB is -sqrt(3). So, at point C, the slope of the astroid must be equal to -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, set:\n\n- (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3)\n\nSimplify:\n\ny^(1/3) / x^(1/3) = sqrt(3)\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3:\n\ny / x = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3*sqrt(3)\n\nSo, y = 3*sqrt(3) x.\n\nBut from AB's equation, y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting y from AB into the above:\n\n3*sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2\n\nLet me solve for x.\n\nBring all terms to the left:\n\n3*sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) x - sqrt(3)/2 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(3*sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)) x = sqrt(3)/2\n\n\u2192 4*sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n4x = 1/2\n\n\u2192 x = 1/(8)\n\nSo, x = 1/8.\n\nThen, substitute back into AB's equation to find y.\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8 + 4 sqrt(3)/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nSo, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nWait, but let me confirm that this point lies on the astroid.\n\nCompute x^(2/3) + y^(2/3):\n\n( (1/8) )^(2/3) + ( (3 sqrt(3)/8) )^(2/3 )\n\nFirst, (1/8)^(2/3) = (1^(2/3)) / (8^(2/3)) )= 1 / (4), since 8^(1/3)=2, so 8^(2/3)=4.\n\nNext, (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^(2/3):\n\nLet me compute 3 sqrt(3) = 3 * 3^(1/2) = 3^(3/2).\n\nSo, 3 sqrt(3)/8 = 3^(3/2) / 8.\n\nSo, (3^(3/2)/8 )^(2/3) = (3^(3/2))^(2/3) / (8)^(2/3) )= 3^( (3/2)*(2/3) ) / 4 = 3^1 /4 = 3/4.\n\nSo, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. So, yes, the point (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8) lies on the astroid.\n\nGood, so that checks out.\n\nSo, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nNow, compute OC\u00b2, which is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/8)^2 = 1/64\n\n(3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = (9 * 3) / 64 = 27/64\n\nSo, OC\u00b2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.\n\nSo, OC\u00b2 is 7/16, so p=7 and q=16, which are coprime. So, p+q=23.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nWait, when I computed (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2, that's 9 * 3 / 64 = 27/64, which is correct.\n\n1/64 + 27/64 is 28/64, which simplifies to 7/16. Yes.\n\nSo, the answer is 7 + 16 = 23.\n",

The point C would be the point where AB is tangent to this envelope, so that it only touches at one point, meaning no other PQ passes through C.\n\nWait, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, if we can find the envelope of all segments PQ in F, then AB may intersect this envelope at point C, which is the only point where AB touches the envelope, meaning that beyond that point, AB doesn't intersect any other PQ in F.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the envelope is a curve that touches each PQ at one point, and AB is tangent to this envelope at C, so C is the point where AB just touches the envelope, and beyond that, AB doesn't intersect any other PQ.\n\nHmm, I'm not too sure, but let me try to think about the equations.\n\nEach PQ segment is a line from (a,0) to (0,b) with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, the equation of the line PQ is x/a + y/b = 1.\n\nBecause the intercepts are (a,0) and (0,b), so the equation is x/a + y/b = 1.\n\nSince a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1, we can write this as x/a + y/b = 1, with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1.\n\nSo, the family of lines is x/a + y/b = 1, where a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe can parametrize a and b using an angle \u03b8, perhaps. Let me set a = cos\u03b8 and b = sin\u03b8, since a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1.\n\nWait, but in that case, a and b are positive because we are in the first quadrant, so \u03b8 would be between 0 and \u03c0/2.\n\nSo, the equation of each PQ line is x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 = 1.\n\nSo, the family of lines is x sec\u03b8 + y csc\u03b8 =1.\n\nNow, the envelope of this family of lines can be found by solving for \u03b8 the system:\n\nx sec\u03b8 + y csc\u03b8 = 1\n\nand\n\nd/d\u03b8 (x sec\u03b8 + y csc\u03b8) = 0\n\nSo, the derivative with respect to \u03b8 is x sec\u03b8 tan\u03b8 - y csc\u03b8 cot\u03b8 = 0.\n\nSo, let's compute that:\n\nd/d\u03b8 (x sec\u03b8 + y csc\u03b8) = x sec\u03b8 tan\u03b8 - y csc\u03b8 cot\u03b8 = 0.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) x sec\u03b8 + y csc\u03b8 = 1\n\n2) x sec\u03b8 tan\u03b8 - y csc\u03b8 cot\u03b8 = 0\n\nLet me write these more simply.\n\nEquation 1: x sec\u03b8 + y csc\u03b8 = 1\n\nEquation 2: x sec\u03b8 tan\u03b8 = y csc\u03b8 cot\u03b8\n\nLet me express everything in terms of sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8.\n\nEquation 1: x / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 = 1\n\nEquation 2: x / cos\u03b8 * (sin\u03b8 / cos\u03b8) = y / sin\u03b8 * (cos\u03b8 / sin\u03b8)\n\nSimplify equation 2:\n\nLeft side: x sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8\n\nRight side: y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes:\n\nx sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 = y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\nx sin\u00b3\u03b8 = y cos\u00b3\u03b8\n\nSo, x sin\u00b3\u03b8 = y cos\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nLet me solve equation 1 for x:\n\nx = (1 - y / sin\u03b8) cos\u03b8\n\n= cos\u03b8 - y cot\u03b8\n\nNow, substitute x into equation 2:\n\n[cos\u03b8 - y cot\u03b8] sin\u00b3\u03b8 = y cos\u00b3\u03b8\n\nExpand the left side:\n\ncos\u03b8 sin\u00b3\u03b8 - y cot\u03b8 sin\u00b3\u03b8 = y cos\u00b3\u03b8\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: cos\u03b8 sin\u00b3\u03b8\n\nSecond term: y cot\u03b8 sin\u00b3\u03b8 = y (cos\u03b8/sin\u03b8) sin\u00b3\u03b8 = y cos\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\ncos\u03b8 sin\u00b3\u03b8 - y cos\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = y cos\u00b3\u03b8\n\nLet's collect terms with y:\n\n- y cos\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - y cos\u00b3\u03b8 = - cos\u03b8 sin\u00b3\u03b8\n\nFactor out y on the left:\n\ny (-cos\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - cos\u00b3\u03b8) = - cos\u03b8 sin\u00b3\u03b8\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\ny (cos\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b3\u03b8) = cos\u03b8 sin\u00b3\u03b8\n\nFactor cos\u03b8 on the left:\n\ny cos\u03b8 (sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8) = cos\u03b8 sin\u00b3\u03b8\n\nBut sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 = 1, so:\n\ny cos\u03b8 * 1 = cos\u03b8 sin\u00b3\u03b8\n\nDivide both sides by cos\u03b8 (assuming cos\u03b8 \u22600, which it is since we're in the first quadrant):\n\ny = sin\u00b3\u03b8\n\nSimilarly, from equation 1, x = cos\u03b8 - y cot\u03b8 = cos\u03b8 - sin\u00b3\u03b8 * (cos\u03b8 / sin\u03b8) = cos\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 cos\u03b8 = cos\u03b8 (1 - sin\u00b2\u03b8) = cos\u03b8 cos\u00b2\u03b8 = cos\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nSo, x = cos\u00b3\u03b8 and y = sin\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, the envelope is the parametric curve x = cos\u00b3\u03b8, y = sin\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nThis is known as the astroid curve. The envelope of the family of lines x sec\u03b8 + y csc\u03b8 =1 is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nSo, the envelope is the astroid given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nNow, the point C is on AB and is the point where AB is tangent to this astroid. Because AB is one of the lines in the family F, and the envelope is the astroid, so AB will be tangent to the astroid at point C.\n\nWait, but AB itself is a line in F, so it should be tangent to the envelope at point C, which is the only point where AB meets the envelope. So, the point C is the point of tangency on AB with the astroid.\n\nSo, to find C, we need to find where AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nSo, let's find the equation of AB and find its point of tangency with the astroid.\n\nFirst, let's find the equation of AB.\n\nPoints A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nThe slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + c.\n\nTo find c, plug in point A: x=1/2, y=0.\n\n0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c \u2192 c = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nNow, the astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nWe need to find the point C on AB where AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nSo, to find the point of tangency, we can solve the system:\n\n1) y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2\n\n2) x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1\n\nAdditionally, the derivatives at point C for both AB and the astroid should be equal.\n\nAlternatively, since AB is a straight line, and the astroid is a curve, the condition for tangency is that the line AB touches the astroid at exactly one point.\n\nBut perhaps using calculus would be more straightforward.\n\nLet me compute the derivative of the astroid.\n\nGiven x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to x:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx = 0\n\nSo, dy/dx = - [ (x^(-1/3)) / (y^(-1/3)) ) ] = - (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3))\n\nSo, the slope of the astroid at any point (x, y) is - (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3))\n\nNow, the slope of AB is -sqrt(3). So, at point C, the slope of the astroid must be equal to -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, set:\n\n- (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3)\n\nSimplify:\n\ny^(1/3) / x^(1/3) = sqrt(3)\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3:\n\ny / x = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3*sqrt(3)\n\nSo, y = 3*sqrt(3) x.\n\nBut from AB's equation, y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting y from AB into the above:\n\n3*sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2\n\nLet me solve for x.\n\nBring all terms to the left:\n\n3*sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) x - sqrt(3)/2 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(3*sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)) x = sqrt(3)/2\n\n\u2192 4*sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n4x = 1/2\n\n\u2192 x = 1/(8)\n\nSo, x = 1/8.\n\nThen, substitute back into AB's equation to find y.\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8 + 4 sqrt(3)/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nSo, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nWait, but let me confirm that this point lies on the astroid.\n\nCompute x^(2/3) + y^(2/3):\n\n( (1/8) )^(2/3) + ( (3 sqrt(3)/8) )^(2/3 )\n\nFirst, (1/8)^(2/3) = (1^(2/3)) / (8^(2/3)) )= 1 / (4), since 8^(1/3)=2, so 8^(2/3)=4.\n\nNext, (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^(2/3):\n\nLet me compute 3 sqrt(3) = 3 * 3^(1/2) = 3^(3/2).\n\nSo, 3 sqrt(3)/8 = 3^(3/2) / 8.\n\nSo, (3^(3/2)/8 )^(2/3) = (3^(3/2))^(2/3) / (8)^(2/3) )= 3^( (3/2)*(2/3) ) / 4 = 3^1 /4 = 3/4.\n\nSo, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. So, yes, the point (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8) lies on the astroid.\n\nGood, so that checks out.\n\nSo, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nNow, compute OC\u00b2, which is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/8)^2 = 1/64\n\n(3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = (9 * 3) / 64 = 27/64\n\nSo, OC\u00b2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.\n\nSo, OC\u00b2 is 7/16, so p=7 and q=16, which are coprime. So, p+q=23.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nWait, when I computed (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2, that's 9 * 3 / 64 = 27/64, which is correct.\n\n1/64 + 27/64 is 28/64, which simplifies to 7/16. Yes.\n\nSo, the answer is 7 + 16 = 23.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first identify the points and the family of segments. Points \\( O(0,0) \\), \\( A(\\frac{1}{2}, 0) \\), and \\( B(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) \\) form the segment \\( \\overline{AB} \\), which is a unit segment in the first quadrant.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem. Hmm, so we have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). We're supposed to find a point C on AB such that C is only on the segment AB from the family F of unit-length segments PQ lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. And then we need to find OC squared, which will be a fraction p/q, and then compute p + q.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize this. So, the points O, A, and B form a triangle. A is on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. The line AB connects these two points. The family F consists of all segments PQ of length 1, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, both in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, any segment PQ in F connects a point P(p,0) on the x-axis to a point Q(0,q) on the y-axis, such that the distance between P and Q is 1. That means sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2) = 1, so p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nWait, but the segment PQ is in the first quadrant, so p and q are positive. So, the set of all such segments would sweep out a kind of curve? Maybe a circle or something else.\n\nBut the problem says that each segment PQ is of unit length, so for each PQ, p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) where p and q are positive and p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nSo, the family F is all such segments. Now, the point C is on AB, and it's unique in that it's only on AB and not on any other segment from F except AB itself. So, we need to find point C on AB that isn't on any other PQ from F.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps we can parametrize AB and find the point C where only AB passes through it, and no other PQ from F passes through it.\n\nLet me find the equation of AB first. Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2).\n\nWait, let me check that. When x = 1/2, y should be 0. So, y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Yes, that looks right. So, the parametric equations for AB can be written as x = 1/2 - t, y = 0 + sqrt(3)*t, where t ranges from 0 to 1/2. Wait, actually, when t=0, we are at A(1/2, 0), and when t=1/2, we reach B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, yes, that parametrization works.\n\nAlternatively, we can write AB in terms of a parameter s, where s goes from 0 to 1, and s=0 is A, s=1 is B. So, x = (1/2)(1 - s), y = (sqrt(3)/2)s. That might be easier.\n\nSo, any point C on AB can be written as ((1/2)(1 - s), (sqrt(3)/2)s) for some s between 0 and 1.\n\nNow, we need to find such a point C that is only on AB and not on any other segment PQ in F except AB itself.\n\nWait, but AB is itself a segment in F? Let me check. AB is from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's compute the length of AB. The distance between A and B is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. Oh, so AB is itself a segment in F because it's of unit length. So, AB is part of the family F.\n\nSo, point C is on AB, and it's only on AB and no other PQ in F. So, for every other segment PQ in F, C is not on PQ.\n\nSo, the point C is the unique point on AB such that no other PQ in F passes through it. So, perhaps this is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of all such segments PQ?\n\nWait, envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. In this case, the family F consists of line segments, so their envelope might form a curve. If AB is a member of F, then perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is the point where AB is the only segment from F passing through it, meaning that for all other segments PQ in F, they don't pass through C.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find the condition that for a given point C on AB, there is no other PQ in F passing through it except AB.\n\nSo, let's parameterize point C as ((1/2)(1 - s), (sqrt(3)/2)s) for s in [0,1]. Then, suppose there's another segment PQ in F that passes through C.\n\nSo, PQ is from (p,0) to (0,q), with p^2 + q^2 =1. The equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1.\n\nSince C lies on PQ, substituting C's coordinates into the equation:\n\n( (1/2)(1 - s) ) / p + ( (sqrt(3)/2)s ) / q = 1.\n\nBut we also have p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nSo, for a given C, we can write the equation ( (1 - s)/2 ) / p + ( sqrt(3)s/2 ) / q = 1.\n\nWe can write this as ( (1 - s)/(2p) ) + ( sqrt(3)s/(2q) ) = 1.\n\nWe need to find s such that this equation has only one solution (p, q) satisfying p^2 + q^2 =1. Because if there's only one solution, that would mean that C is only on AB and no other PQ.\n\nWait, but if C is on AB, which is a segment in F, so that would correspond to p =1/2 and q= sqrt(3)/2. So, that's one solution.\n\nBut we want that there are no other (p, q) such that C lies on PQ, so that the equation above has only one solution (p, q) which is (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSo, to find C such that the equation:\n\n( (1 - s)/(2p) ) + ( sqrt(3)s/(2q) ) = 1,\n\nhas only one solution (p, q) with p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be treated as a system of equations. So, we have two equations:\n\n1. ( (1 - s)/(2p) ) + ( sqrt(3)s/(2q) ) = 1,\n2. p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nWe can try to solve this system for p and q, and find the condition that this system has exactly one solution, which would be (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, the point C is such that when we solve these two equations, the only solution is (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSo, let's try to solve equation 1 for p and q.\n\nLet me denote equation 1 as:\n\n(1 - s)/(2p) + (sqrt(3)s)/(2q) = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n(1 - s)/p + (sqrt(3)s)/q = 2.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n(1 - s)/p = 2 - (sqrt(3)s)/q.\n\nThen, (1 - s)/p = 2 - (sqrt(3)s)/q.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to express p in terms of q or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, let's let u = p, v = q. Then, we have:\n\n(1 - s)/(2u) + (sqrt(3)s)/(2v) = 1,\n\nand u^2 + v^2 =1.\n\nLet me write equation 1 as:\n\n(1 - s)/(2u) + (sqrt(3)s)/(2v) = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2u v:\n\n(1 - s)v + sqrt(3)s u = 2uv.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 - s)v + sqrt(3)s u = 2uv.\n\nHmm, that's an equation involving u and v. Let's rearrange:\n\n2uv - (1 - s)v - sqrt(3)s u = 0.\n\nFactor terms:\n\nv(2u - (1 - s)) - sqrt(3)s u = 0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe we can express v in terms of u or vice versa.\n\nWait, from equation 2, v^2 =1 - u^2, so v = sqrt(1 - u^2). Since we're in the first quadrant, v is positive.\n\nSo, substituting v = sqrt(1 - u^2) into equation 1:\n\n(1 - s)/(2u) + (sqrt(3)s)/(2 sqrt(1 - u^2)) = 1.\n\nThis is a complicated equation, but perhaps we can square both sides to eliminate the square roots. But first, let's write it as:\n\n(1 - s)/(2u) + (sqrt(3)s)/(2 sqrt(1 - u^2)) = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2u sqrt(1 - u^2):\n\n(1 - s) sqrt(1 - u^2) + sqrt(3)s u = 2u sqrt(1 - u^2).\n\nHmm, that's still complicated. Maybe we can rearrange:\n\n(1 - s) sqrt(1 - u^2) - 2u sqrt(1 - u^2) + sqrt(3)s u = 0.\n\nFactor sqrt(1 - u^2):\n\nsqrt(1 - u^2) [1 - s - 2u] + sqrt(3)s u =0.\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, let's denote t = u, then sqrt(1 - u^2) = v.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n(1 - s) v + sqrt(3)s t = 2 t v.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write equation 1 as:\n\n(1 - s)/(2u) + (sqrt(3)s)/(2v) =1.\n\nLet me denote a = u, b = v. Then, equation 1:\n\n(1 - s)/(2a) + (sqrt(3)s)/(2b) =1,\n\nand a^2 + b^2 =1.\n\nLet me write equation 1 as:\n\n(1 - s)/(2a) =1 - (sqrt(3)s)/(2b).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2a:\n\n1 - s = 2a [1 - (sqrt(3)s)/(2b)].\n\nSo,\n\n1 - s = 2a - (sqrt(3)s a)/b.\n\nBut since a^2 + b^2 =1, we can write b = sqrt(1 - a^2). So,\n\n1 - s = 2a - (sqrt(3)s a)/sqrt(1 - a^2).\n\nThis is getting messy. Maybe a better approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the family of lines PQ. Each PQ is a line x/p + y/q =1 with p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nSo, the envelope of this family of lines can be found by solving the system:\n\nF(p, q, x, y) = x/p + y/q -1 =0,\n\nand the derivative with respect to a parameter.\n\nBut since p and q are related by p^2 + q^2=1, perhaps we can parametrize p and q in terms of an angle.\n\nLet me set p = cos\u03b8 and q = sin\u03b8, since p^2 + q^2 =1. So, \u03b8 is an angle parameter.\n\nThen, the equation of PQ becomes x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) =1.\n\nSo, for each \u03b8, we have a line PQ.\n\nThe envelope of these lines is found by solving:\n\nx/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1,\n\nand the derivative with respect to \u03b8:\n\nd/d\u03b8 (x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8) =0.\n\nSo,\n\nx sin\u03b8 / cos^2\u03b8 - y cos\u03b8 / sin^2\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo,\n\nx sin\u03b8 / cos^2\u03b8 = y cos\u03b8 / sin^2\u03b8,\n\nwhich implies:\n\nx sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8,\n\nso,\n\nx = y (cos^3\u03b8)/(sin^3\u03b8) = y cot^3\u03b8.\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1. x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1,\n\n2. x = y cot^3\u03b8.\n\nSubstituting equation 2 into equation 1:\n\n(y cot^3\u03b8)/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\ny cot^3\u03b8 / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nExpress cot\u03b8 as cos\u03b8/sin\u03b8:\n\ny (cos^3\u03b8/sin^3\u03b8) / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1,\n\nsimplify:\n\ny (cos^2\u03b8/sin^3\u03b8) + y / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nFactor out y/sin\u03b8:\n\ny/sin\u03b8 (cos^2\u03b8/sin^2\u03b8 +1 ) =1.\n\nSo,\n\ny/sin\u03b8 ( (cos^2\u03b8 + sin^2\u03b8)/sin^2\u03b8 ) =1.\n\nBut cos^2\u03b8 + sin^2\u03b8=1, so:\n\ny/sin\u03b8 (1/sin^2\u03b8) )=1,\n\nwhich is:\n\ny / sin^3\u03b8 =1,\n\nso,\n\ny= sin^3\u03b8.\n\nFrom equation 2, x= y cot^3\u03b8= sin^3\u03b8 * (cos\u03b8/sin\u03b8)^3= sin^3\u03b8 * cos^3\u03b8 / sin^3\u03b8= cos^3\u03b8.\n\nSo, the envelope is parametrized by \u03b8 as (cos^3\u03b8, sin^3\u03b8). So, it's a astroid, or a hypocycloid with four cusps.\n\nWait, the parametric equations (cos^3\u03b8, sin^3\u03b8) trace out an astroid. So, the envelope of the family F is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nSo, the astroid is the envelope of all these lines PQ.\n\nNow, the point C is on AB and is only on AB, not on any other PQ in F. That means C is a point where AB is tangent to the astroid. Because if AB is tangent to the astroid at C, then C is only on AB and the astroid, which is the envelope.\n\nWait, but AB is itself a member of F, so the point of tangency would be the point where AB touches the astroid, meaning that C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nSo, we need to find the point C where AB is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nSo, let's find the equation of AB and find its point of tangency with the astroid.\n\nThe equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Because when x=1/2, y=0, and the slope is -sqrt(3). So, equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, to find the point of tangency, we can solve the system:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nand\n\nx^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nSubstitute y from the first equation into the second:\n\nx^(2/3) + ( -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 )^(2/3) =1.\n\nThis looks complicated, but maybe we can simplify.\n\nLet me denote t = x^(1/3), so x= t^3.\n\nThen, x^(2/3) = t^2.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute y:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)(-x +1/2) = sqrt(3)(-t^3 +1/2).\n\nSo, y = sqrt(3)(-t^3 +1/2).\n\nThen, y^(2/3) = [ sqrt(3)(-t^3 +1/2) ]^(2/3).\n\nHmm, this might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps we can use calculus to find the condition for tangency.\n\nThe astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1 has derivative dy/dx. Let's compute that.\n\nDifferentiate implicitly:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx =0.\n\nSo,\n\ndy/dx = - [ (2/3)x^(-1/3) ] / [ (2/3)y^(-1/3) ] = - (x^(-1/3)) / (y^(-1/3)) ) = - (y^(1/3)/x^(1/3)).\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent to the astroid at (x,y) is - (y^(1/3)/x^(1/3)).\n\nNow, the slope of AB is -sqrt(3). So, for the astroid to be tangent to AB at point C, the slope of the astroid at C must be equal to the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\n- (y^(1/3)/x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3),\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\ny^(1/3)/x^(1/3) = sqrt(3),\n\nso,\n\n(y/x) = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3*sqrt(3).\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nIf y^(1/3)/x^(1/3) = sqrt(3), then (y/x) = (sqrt(3))^3 = (3)^(3/2) = 3*sqrt(3). Yes, correct.\n\nSo, y = 3*sqrt(3) x.\n\nBut we also know that point C lies on AB: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting y = 3*sqrt(3) x into AB's equation:\n\n3*sqrt(3)x = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nBring terms together:\n\n3*sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)x = sqrt(3)/2,\n\nwhich is,\n\n4*sqrt(3)x = sqrt(3)/2,\n\nso,\n\nx = (sqrt(3)/2) / (4*sqrt(3)) ) = (1/2)/4 = 1/8.\n\nSo, x=1/8.\n\nThen, y=3*sqrt(3)*(1/8)= 3*sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo, the coordinates of C are (1/8, 3*sqrt(3)/8).\n\nWait, but let's check if this point lies on the astroid.\n\nCompute x^(2/3) + y^(2/3):\n\n( (1/8) )^(2/3) + ( (3*sqrt(3)/8) )^(2/3 )\n\n= (1/8)^(2/3) + ( (3^(3/2) /8 ) )^(2/3 )\n\n= (1/8)^(2/3) + (3^(3/2))^(2/3) / (8)^(2/3)\n\n= (1/8)^(2/3) + 3^(1) / (8)^(2/3)\n\n= (1/4) + 3 / (4)\n\n= 1/4 + 3/4 =1.\n\nYes, it satisfies the astroid equation.\n\nSo, point C is (1/8, 3*sqrt(3)/8).\n\nNow, compute OC^2, which is (1/8)^2 + (3*sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/8)^2 =1/64,\n\n(3*sqrt(3)/8)^2 =9*3 /64 =27/64.\n\nSo, OC^2 =1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nWait, 1+27=28, and 28/64 simplifies to 7/16.\n\nSo, OC^2=7/16. Thus, p=7, q=16, which are coprime. So, p+q=23.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations.\n\nPoint C: x=1/8, y=3sqrt(3)/8.\n\nOC squared is x^2 + y^2.\n\nx^2=1/64,\n\ny^2=(9*3)/64=27/64,\n\nso total is 28/64=7/16.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 7/16, so p+q=23.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem. Hmm, so we have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). We're supposed to find a point C on AB such that C is only on the segment AB from the family F of unit-length segments PQ lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. And then we need to find OC squared, which will be a fraction p/q, and then compute p + q.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize this. So, the points O, A, and B form a triangle. A is on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. The line AB connects these two points. The family F consists of all segments PQ of length 1, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, both in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, any segment PQ in F connects a point P(p,0) on the x-axis to a point Q(0,q) on the y-axis, such that the distance between P and Q is 1. That means sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2) = 1, so p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nWait, but the segment PQ is in the first quadrant, so p and q are positive. So, the set of all such segments would sweep out a kind of curve? Maybe a circle or something else.\n\nBut the problem says that each segment PQ is of unit length, so for each PQ, p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) where p and q are positive and p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nSo, the family F is all such segments. Now, the point C is on AB, and it's unique in that it's only on AB and not on any other segment from F except AB itself. So, we need to find point C on AB that isn't on any other PQ from F.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps we can parametrize AB and find the point C where only AB passes through it, and no other PQ from F passes through it.\n\nLet me find the equation of AB first. Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2).\n\nWait, let me check that. When x = 1/2, y should be 0. So, y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Yes, that looks right. So, the parametric equations for AB can be written as x = 1/2 - t, y = 0 + sqrt(3)*t, where t ranges from 0 to 1/2. Wait, actually, when t=0, we are at A(1/2, 0), and when t=1/2, we reach B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, yes, that parametrization works.\n\nAlternatively, we can write AB in terms of a parameter s, where s goes from 0 to 1, and s=0 is A, s=1 is B. So, x = (1/2)(1 - s), y = (sqrt(3)/2)s. That might be easier.\n\nSo, any point C on AB can be written as ((1/2)(1 - s), (sqrt(3)/2)s) for some s between 0 and 1.\n\nNow, we need to find such a point C that is only on AB and not on any other segment PQ in F except AB itself.\n\nWait, but AB is itself a segment in F? Let me check. AB is from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's compute the length of AB. The distance between A and B is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. Oh, so AB is itself a segment in F because it's of unit length. So, AB is part of the family F.\n\nSo, point C is on AB, and it's only on AB and no other PQ in F. So, for every other segment PQ in F, C is not on PQ.\n\nSo, the point C is the unique point on AB such that no other PQ in F passes through it. So, perhaps this is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of all such segments PQ?\n\nWait, envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. In this case, the family F consists of line segments, so their envelope might form a curve. If AB is a member of F, then perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is the point where AB is the only segment from F passing through it, meaning that for all other segments PQ in F, they don't pass through C.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find the condition that for a given point C on AB, there is no other PQ in F passing through it except AB.\n\nSo, let's parameterize point C as ((1/2)(1 - s), (sqrt(3)/2)s) for s in [0,1]. Then, suppose there's another segment PQ in F that passes through C.\n\nSo, PQ is from (p,0) to (0,q), with p^2 + q^2 =1. The equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1.\n\nSince C lies on PQ, substituting C's coordinates into the equation:\n\n( (1/2)(1 - s) ) / p + ( (sqrt(3)/2)s ) / q = 1.\n\nBut we also have p^2 + q^2 = 1.\n\nSo, for a given C, we can write the equation ( (1 - s)/2 ) / p + ( sqrt(3)s/2 ) / q = 1.\n\nWe can write this as ( (1 - s)/(2p) ) + ( sqrt(3)s/(2q) ) = 1.\n\nWe need to find s such that this equation has only one solution (p, q) satisfying p^2 + q^2 =1. Because if there's only one solution, that would mean that C is only on AB and no other PQ.\n\nWait, but if C is on AB, which is a segment in F, so that would correspond to p =1/2 and q= sqrt(3)/2. So, that's one solution.\n\nBut we want that there are no other (p, q) such that C lies on PQ, so that the equation above has only one solution (p, q) which is (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSo, to find C such that the equation:\n\n( (1 - s)/(2p) ) + ( sqrt(3)s/(2q) ) = 1,\n\nhas only one solution (p, q) with p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be treated as a system of equations. So, we have two equations:\n\n1. ( (1 - s)/(2p) ) + ( sqrt(3)s/(2q) ) = 1,\n2. p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nWe can try to solve this system for p and q, and find the condition that this system has exactly one solution, which would be (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, the point C is such that when we solve these two equations, the only solution is (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSo, let's try to solve equation 1 for p and q.\n\nLet me denote equation 1 as:\n\n(1 - s)/(2p) + (sqrt(3)s)/(2q) = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n(1 - s)/p + (sqrt(3)s)/q = 2.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n(1 - s)/p = 2 - (sqrt(3)s)/q.\n\nThen, (1 - s)/p = 2 - (sqrt(3)s)/q.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to express p in terms of q or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, let's let u = p, v = q. Then, we have:\n\n(1 - s)/(2u) + (sqrt(3)s)/(2v) = 1,\n\nand u^2 + v^2 =1.\n\nLet me write equation 1 as:\n\n(1 - s)/(2u) + (sqrt(3)s)/(2v) = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2u v:\n\n(1 - s)v + sqrt(3)s u = 2uv.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 - s)v + sqrt(3)s u = 2uv.\n\nHmm, that's an equation involving u and v. Let's rearrange:\n\n2uv - (1 - s)v - sqrt(3)s u = 0.\n\nFactor terms:\n\nv(2u - (1 - s)) - sqrt(3)s u = 0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe we can express v in terms of u or vice versa.\n\nWait, from equation 2, v^2 =1 - u^2, so v = sqrt(1 - u^2). Since we're in the first quadrant, v is positive.\n\nSo, substituting v = sqrt(1 - u^2) into equation 1:\n\n(1 - s)/(2u) + (sqrt(3)s)/(2 sqrt(1 - u^2)) = 1.\n\nThis is a complicated equation, but perhaps we can square both sides to eliminate the square roots. But first, let's write it as:\n\n(1 - s)/(2u) + (sqrt(3)s)/(2 sqrt(1 - u^2)) = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2u sqrt(1 - u^2):\n\n(1 - s) sqrt(1 - u^2) + sqrt(3)s u = 2u sqrt(1 - u^2).\n\nHmm, that's still complicated. Maybe we can rearrange:\n\n(1 - s) sqrt(1 - u^2) - 2u sqrt(1 - u^2) + sqrt(3)s u = 0.\n\nFactor sqrt(1 - u^2):\n\nsqrt(1 - u^2) [1 - s - 2u] + sqrt(3)s u =0.\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, let's denote t = u, then sqrt(1 - u^2) = v.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n(1 - s) v + sqrt(3)s t = 2 t v.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write equation 1 as:\n\n(1 - s)/(2u) + (sqrt(3)s)/(2v) =1.\n\nLet me denote a = u, b = v. Then, equation 1:\n\n(1 - s)/(2a) + (sqrt(3)s)/(2b) =1,\n\nand a^2 + b^2 =1.\n\nLet me write equation 1 as:\n\n(1 - s)/(2a) =1 - (sqrt(3)s)/(2b).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2a:\n\n1 - s = 2a [1 - (sqrt(3)s)/(2b)].\n\nSo,\n\n1 - s = 2a - (sqrt(3)s a)/b.\n\nBut since a^2 + b^2 =1, we can write b = sqrt(1 - a^2). So,\n\n1 - s = 2a - (sqrt(3)s a)/sqrt(1 - a^2).\n\nThis is getting messy. Maybe a better approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the family of lines PQ. Each PQ is a line x/p + y/q =1 with p^2 + q^2 =1.\n\nSo, the envelope of this family of lines can be found by solving the system:\n\nF(p, q, x, y) = x/p + y/q -1 =0,\n\nand the derivative with respect to a parameter.\n\nBut since p and q are related by p^2 + q^2=1, perhaps we can parametrize p and q in terms of an angle.\n\nLet me set p = cos\u03b8 and q = sin\u03b8, since p^2 + q^2 =1. So, \u03b8 is an angle parameter.\n\nThen, the equation of PQ becomes x/(cos\u03b8) + y/(sin\u03b8) =1.\n\nSo, for each \u03b8, we have a line PQ.\n\nThe envelope of these lines is found by solving:\n\nx/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1,\n\nand the derivative with respect to \u03b8:\n\nd/d\u03b8 (x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8) =0.\n\nSo,\n\nx sin\u03b8 / cos^2\u03b8 - y cos\u03b8 / sin^2\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo,\n\nx sin\u03b8 / cos^2\u03b8 = y cos\u03b8 / sin^2\u03b8,\n\nwhich implies:\n\nx sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8,\n\nso,\n\nx = y (cos^3\u03b8)/(sin^3\u03b8) = y cot^3\u03b8.\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1. x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1,\n\n2. x = y cot^3\u03b8.\n\nSubstituting equation 2 into equation 1:\n\n(y cot^3\u03b8)/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\ny cot^3\u03b8 / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nExpress cot\u03b8 as cos\u03b8/sin\u03b8:\n\ny (cos^3\u03b8/sin^3\u03b8) / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1,\n\nsimplify:\n\ny (cos^2\u03b8/sin^3\u03b8) + y / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nFactor out y/sin\u03b8:\n\ny/sin\u03b8 (cos^2\u03b8/sin^2\u03b8 +1 ) =1.\n\nSo,\n\ny/sin\u03b8 ( (cos^2\u03b8 + sin^2\u03b8)/sin^2\u03b8 ) =1.\n\nBut cos^2\u03b8 + sin^2\u03b8=1, so:\n\ny/sin\u03b8 (1/sin^2\u03b8) )=1,\n\nwhich is:\n\ny / sin^3\u03b8 =1,\n\nso,\n\ny= sin^3\u03b8.\n\nFrom equation 2, x= y cot^3\u03b8= sin^3\u03b8 * (cos\u03b8/sin\u03b8)^3= sin^3\u03b8 * cos^3\u03b8 / sin^3\u03b8= cos^3\u03b8.\n\nSo, the envelope is parametrized by \u03b8 as (cos^3\u03b8, sin^3\u03b8). So, it's a astroid, or a hypocycloid with four cusps.\n\nWait, the parametric equations (cos^3\u03b8, sin^3\u03b8) trace out an astroid. So, the envelope of the family F is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nSo, the astroid is the envelope of all these lines PQ.\n\nNow, the point C is on AB and is only on AB, not on any other PQ in F.

Because when x=1/2, y=0, and the slope is -sqrt(3). So, equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, to find the point of tangency, we can solve the system:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nand\n\nx^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nSubstitute y from the first equation into the second:\n\nx^(2/3) + ( -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 )^(2/3) =1.\n\nThis looks complicated, but maybe we can simplify.\n\nLet me denote t = x^(1/3), so x= t^3.\n\nThen, x^(2/3) = t^2.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute y:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)(-x +1/2) = sqrt(3)(-t^3 +1/2).\n\nSo, y = sqrt(3)(-t^3 +1/2).\n\nThen, y^(2/3) = [ sqrt(3)(-t^3 +1/2) ]^(2/3).\n\nHmm, this might not be helpful.

Let's compute that.\n\nDifferentiate implicitly:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx =0.\n\nSo,\n\ndy/dx = - [ (2/3)x^(-1/3) ] / [ (2/3)y^(-1/3) ] = - (x^(-1/3)) / (y^(-1/3)) ) = - (y^(1/3)/x^(1/3)).\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent to the astroid at (x,y) is - (y^(1/3)/x^(1/3)).\n\nNow, the slope of AB is -sqrt(3). So, for the astroid to be tangent to AB at point C, the slope of the astroid at C must be equal to the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\n- (y^(1/3)/x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3),\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\ny^(1/3)/x^(1/3) = sqrt(3),\n\nso,\n\n(y/x) = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3*sqrt(3).\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nIf y^(1/3)/x^(1/3) = sqrt(3), then (y/x) = (sqrt(3))^3 = (3)^(3/2) = 3*sqrt(3). Yes, correct.\n\nSo, y = 3*sqrt(3) x.\n\nBut we also know that point C lies on AB: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting y = 3*sqrt(3) x into AB's equation:\n\n3*sqrt(3)x = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nBring terms together:\n\n3*sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)x = sqrt(3)/2,\n\nwhich is,\n\n4*sqrt(3)x = sqrt(3)/2,\n\nso,\n\nx = (sqrt(3)/2) / (4*sqrt(3)) ) = (1/2)/4 = 1/8.\n\nSo, x=1/8.\n\nThen, y=3*sqrt(3)*(1/8)= 3*sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo, the coordinates of C are (1/8, 3*sqrt(3)/8).\n\nWait, but let's check if this point lies on the astroid.\n\nCompute x^(2/3) + y^(2/3):\n\n( (1/8) )^(2/3) + ( (3*sqrt(3)/8) )^(2/3 )\n\n= (1/8)^(2/3) + ( (3^(3/2) /8 ) )^(2/3 )\n\n= (1/8)^(2/3) + (3^(3/2))^(2/3) / (8)^(2/3)\n\n= (1/8)^(2/3) + 3^(1) / (8)^(2/3)\n\n= (1/4) + 3 / (4)\n\n= 1/4 + 3/4 =1.\n\nYes, it satisfies the astroid equation.\n\nSo, point C is (1/8, 3*sqrt(3)/8).\n\nNow, compute OC^2, which is (1/8)^2 + (3*sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/8)^2 =1/64,\n\n(3*sqrt(3)/8)^2 =9*3 /64 =27/64.\n\nSo, OC^2 =1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nWait, 1+27=28, and 28/64 simplifies to 7/16.\n\nSo, OC^2=7/16. Thus, p=7, q=16, which are coprime. So, p+q=23.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations.\n\nPoint C: x=1/8, y=3sqrt(3)/8.\n\nOC squared is x^2 + y^2.\n\nx^2=1/64,\n\ny^2=(9*3)/64=27/64,\n\nso total is 28/64=7/16.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 7/16, so p+q=23.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first identify the family of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. Each segment PQ can be parameterized by points (p, 0) and (0, q) such that \\( p^2 + q^2 = 1 \\). The equation of any such segment is \\( \\frac{x}{p} + \\frac{y}{q} = 1 \\).\n\nThe line segment AB connects points \\( A\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right) \\) and \\( B\\left(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\). The equation of AB is found to be \\( y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nTo find the unique point \\( C \\) on AB that does not lie on any other segment from the family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\), we determine the envelope of the family of lines PQ. The envelope is an astroid given by \\( x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1 \\).\n\nThe point \\( C \\) is where AB is tangent to this astroid. By solving the system of equations for AB and the astroid, and ensuring the slopes match at the point of tangency, we find \\( C \\) at \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\right) \\).\n\nFinally, we compute \\( OC^2 \\), which is \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{27}{64} = \\frac{28}{64} = \\frac{7}{16} \\). Thus, \\( p = 7 \\) and \\( q = 16 \\), giving \\( p + q = 23 \\).\n\n\\boxed{23}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step.\n\nFirst, the points are given as O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis at (1/2, 0), and B is on the y-axis at (0, sqrt(3)/2). Then, there's a family F of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ has length 1, starts at some point P on the x-axis, ends at some point Q on the y-axis, and lies entirely in the first quadrant.\n\nNow, the problem is about a point C on AB, other than A and B, that isn't on any other segment from F except AB itself. So, AB is one such segment in F, right? Because A is on the x-axis and B is on the y-axis, and the distance between A and B should be 1 unit. Let me verify that.\n\nDistance between A and B: sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. Yes, so AB is indeed a segment of length 1 in F.\n\nSo, F is a family of all such segments PQ with unit length in the first quadrant. The point C is on AB, but not on any other segment from F except AB. So, C is unique in that sense.\n\nWe need to find OC\u00b2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.\n\nHmm. So, maybe I can parametrize point C on AB and find conditions where it doesn't lie on any other PQ from F.\n\nFirst, let me find the equation of line AB. Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2), which simplifies to y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) where x is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nSo, point C is (x, y) = (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2).\n\nNow, the problem is that C should not lie on any other segment PQ in F except AB. So, we need to ensure that for all other segments PQ in F, the point C is not on PQ. Except for AB, of course.\n\nWhat defines a segment PQ in F? It's a segment from P(p, 0) to Q(0, q), where p and q are positive real numbers such that the distance between P and Q is 1. So, the distance PQ is sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, which implies p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, for any such P(p, 0) and Q(0, q), the segment PQ connects (p,0) to (0,q), and lies in the first quadrant.\n\nNow, to find if a point C lies on PQ, we can parametrize PQ.\n\nParametric equations for PQ: Any point on PQ can be written as (p - tp, tq) where t ranges from 0 to 1. Wait, maybe it's better to write it in terms of a parameter s, where s goes from 0 to 1.\n\nSo, the parametric form is (p(1 - s), q s), where s \u2208 [0,1]. When s=0, we're at P(p,0), and s=1, we're at Q(0,q).\n\nSo, if point C lies on PQ, then there exists some s \u2208 [0,1] such that:\n\nx = p(1 - s)\n\ny = q s\n\nBut since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, because PQ is of unit length.\n\nSo, given point C(x, y), if there exist p, q, s with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, s \u2208 [0,1], such that x = p(1 - s) and y = q s, then C lies on PQ.\n\nBut in our case, C lies on AB, and we want to find the unique C on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ except AB.\n\nSo, for all other PQ in F, the system of equations:\n\nx = p(1 - s)\n\ny = q s\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1\n\nhas no solution in p, q, s with s \u2208 [0,1], except when PQ is AB itself.\n\nSo, to find such a C, we need to find a point (x, y) on AB such that the system above only has a solution when PQ is AB.\n\nAlternatively, for any other PQ, this system should have no solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the envelope of all such PQ segments, and the point C is the point where AB is tangent to this envelope.\n\nWait, that might be a useful approach. The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, perhaps the envelope of all PQ in F is a curve, and AB is tangent to this envelope at point C. Then, point C would be the point where AB touches the envelope, and hence, it's the only point on AB that lies on the envelope, so it's the only point on AB that's on any PQ except AB itself. Hmm, maybe.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe we can think in terms of duality or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize PQ segments and find for which C the system has a solution.\n\nLet me try this.\n\nLet me suppose that point C(x, y) is on AB, so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe want to see if there exists p, q, s such that x = p(1 - s), y = q s, and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe can express p and q in terms of x and y.\n\nFrom x = p(1 - s) and y = q s, we can write p = x / (1 - s) and q = y / s.\n\nBut since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, substituting gives (x\u00b2)/(1 - s)^2 + (y\u00b2)/(s)^2 = 1.\n\nSo, for each C(x, y), we can consider whether there exists an s \u2208 (0,1) such that (x\u00b2)/(1 - s)^2 + (y\u00b2)/(s)^2 = 1.\n\nIf for some s, this equation holds, then C lies on the corresponding PQ.\n\nWe want to find C on AB such that this equation has no solution except when PQ is AB itself.\n\nSo, if we substitute y from AB into this equation, we can get an equation in x and s, and then find conditions when this equation has no solution except for the case when PQ is AB.\n\nWait, but when PQ is AB, what's s?\n\nFor AB, P is (1/2, 0), Q is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, in terms of parametrization, s would be such that x = (1/2)(1 - s), y = (sqrt(3)/2) s.\n\nSo, from point C being on AB, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. So, substituting x = (1/2)(1 - s), we get y = -sqrt(3)*(1/2)(1 - s) + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWhich is y = (-sqrt(3)/2 + (sqrt(3)/2)s) + sqrt(3)/2 = (sqrt(3)/2)s. Which matches the y = (sqrt(3)/2) s from PQ.\n\nSo, for AB, s is the parameter that moves from 0 to 1 along AB.\n\nBut for other PQ segments, s would vary, but for each such segment, we can have a different s.\n\nWait, but for a general C on AB, we can write x and y in terms of s, but in this problem, s is a parameter for each PQ segment.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of s as a variable for each PQ segment, and for each PQ, s can be in [0,1]. So, for each PQ, there's a different s. But for our point C(x, y), if there exists an s such that (x^2)/(1 - s)^2 + (y^2)/(s^2) = 1, then C lies on that PQ.\n\nSo, to find points C on AB where this equation has no solution for s \u2208 (0,1), except when PQ is AB.\n\nSo, let's substitute y from AB into the equation.\n\nFrom AB: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nLet me denote x as x, and y as -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting into (x\u00b2)/(1 - s)^2 + (y\u00b2)/(s\u00b2) = 1:\n\n(x\u00b2)/(1 - s)^2 + [(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)^2]/(s^2) = 1.\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n[(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)^2] = (sqrt(3))^2 (x - 1/2)^2 = 3(x - 1/2)^2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2/(1 - s)^2 + 3(x - 1/2)^2 / s\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n[x\u00b2]/(1 - s)^2 + [3(x - 1/2)^2]/s\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe can think of this as an equation in s, for a given x.\n\nWe need to find x such that this equation has no solution s \u2208 (0,1), except when s is such that the PQ is AB.\n\nWait, but when PQ is AB, what is s?\n\nFrom AB's parametrization, when s = 1, we reach Q, which is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Wait, no, actually, when s is 1, x = p(1 - 1) = 0, which is point Q.\n\nWait, maybe I should parametrize AB differently.\n\nWait, in AB, P is (1/2, 0), Q is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, for AB, the parametrization is (1/2 (1 - s), sqrt(3)/2 s), where s \u2208 [0,1].\n\nSo, for point C on AB, it's (1/2 (1 - s), sqrt(3)/2 s).\n\nSo, in our earlier substitution, for AB, s is the parameter.\n\nWait, but in the general case, for any PQ, we have x = p(1 - s), y = q s, and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, for point C on AB, the question is: does there exist s \u2208 (0,1) and p, q such that p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, x = p(1 - s), y = q s, and C is not on AB.\n\nWait, but C is on AB, so the only solution is when PQ is AB. So, we need to ensure that for other PQs, there's no s that satisfies the equation.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to approach this is to set up the equation and find the x for which the equation has no solution in s, except when PQ is AB.\n\nSo, let's consider the equation:\n\nx\u00b2/(1 - s)^2 + 3(x - 1/2)^2 / s\u00b2 = 1.\n\nLet me denote t = s. So, t is in (0,1).\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nx\u00b2/(1 - t)^2 + 3(x - 1/2)^2 / t\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe can think of this as an equation in t. For each x, we can attempt to solve for t.\n\nWe can write this equation as:\n\nx\u00b2/(1 - t)^2 + 3(x - 1/2)^2 / t\u00b2 = 1.\n\nLet me denote A = x\u00b2, B = 3(x - 1/2)^2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA/(1 - t)^2 + B/t\u00b2 = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 - t)^2 t\u00b2:\n\nA t\u00b2 + B (1 - t)^2 = (1 - t)^2 t\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps expanding both sides.\n\nLeft side: A t\u00b2 + B (1 - 2t + t\u00b2) = A t\u00b2 + B - 2 B t + B t\u00b2.\n\nRight side: (1 - 2t + t\u00b2) t\u00b2 = t\u00b2 - 2 t^3 + t^4.\n\nSo, moving all terms to one side:\n\nA t\u00b2 + B - 2 B t + B t\u00b2 - t\u00b2 + 2 t^3 - t^4 = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-1) t^4 + 2 t^3 + (A + B - 1) t\u00b2 - 2 B t + B = 0.\n\nSo, we have a quartic equation in t:\n\n- t^4 + 2 t^3 + (A + B - 1) t\u00b2 - 2 B t + B = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make it positive leading coefficient:\n\nt^4 - 2 t^3 + (-A - B + 1) t\u00b2 + 2 B t - B = 0.\n\nSubstituting back A = x\u00b2 and B = 3(x - 1/2)^2:\n\nt^4 - 2 t^3 + (-x\u00b2 - 3(x - 1/2)^2 + 1) t\u00b2 + 6(x - 1/2)^2 t - 3(x - 1/2)^2 = 0.\n\nLet me compute each coefficient step by step.\n\nFirst, compute coefficient of t^4: 1.\n\nCoefficient of t^3: -2.\n\nCoefficient of t^2: (-x\u00b2 - 3(x - 1/2)^2 + 1).\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n- x\u00b2 - 3(x\u00b2 - x + 1/4) + 1.\n\n= -x\u00b2 - 3x\u00b2 + 3x - 3/4 + 1.\n\n= (-1 -3) x\u00b2 + 3x + (-3/4 + 1).\n\n= -4x\u00b2 + 3x + 1/4.\n\nCoefficient of t^2: (-4x\u00b2 + 3x + 1/4).\n\nCoefficient of t: 6(x - 1/2)^2.\n\nWhich is 6(x\u00b2 - x + 1/4) = 6x\u00b2 - 6x + 3/2.\n\nConstant term: -3(x - 1/2)^2.\n\nWhich is -3x\u00b2 + 3x - 3/4.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the quartic equation is:\n\nt^4 - 2 t^3 + (-4x\u00b2 + 3x + 1/4) t\u00b2 + (6x\u00b2 - 6x + 3/2) t + (-3x\u00b2 + 3x - 3/4) = 0.\n\nHmm, this is a quartic equation in t, which seems complicated. But perhaps we can factor it or find some structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of this as a quadratic in t\u00b2, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of this equation as having a double root or something.\n\nWait, but maybe we can consider that when PQ is AB, the equation should have a solution t = s, where s is the parameter for AB.\n\nIn AB's parametrization, for point C, x = (1/2)(1 - s), y = (sqrt(3)/2) s.\n\nSo, s = 1 - 2x.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nFrom x = (1/2)(1 - s), we have 2x = 1 - s => s = 1 - 2x.\n\nYes, so s = 1 - 2x.\n\nSo, in the quartic equation, t = s = 1 - 2x is a solution when PQ is AB.\n\nSo, perhaps (t - (1 - 2x)) is a factor of the quartic equation.\n\nLet me perform polynomial division to factor out (t - (1 - 2x)).\n\nWait, but this might be complicated, but let me try.\n\nLet me denote k = 1 - 2x, so the factor is (t - k).\n\nWe can write the quartic as (t - k)(t^3 + a t^2 + b t + c) = 0.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nt^4 + a t^3 + b t^2 + c t - k t^3 - a k t^2 - b k t - c k.\n\nComparing with the original quartic:\n\nt^4 - 2 t^3 + (-4x\u00b2 + 3x + 1/4) t\u00b2 + (6x\u00b2 - 6x + 3/2) t + (-3x\u00b2 + 3x - 3/4).\n\nSo, equate coefficients:\n\n1. Coefficient of t^4: 1 = 1, okay.\n\n2. Coefficient of t^3: a - k = -2.\n\n3. Coefficient of t^2: b - a k = (-4x\u00b2 + 3x + 1/4).\n\n4. Coefficient of t: c - b k = (6x\u00b2 - 6x + 3/2).\n\n5. Constant term: -c k = (-3x\u00b2 + 3x - 3/4).\n\nSo, let me write these equations step by step.\n\nFrom equation 2: a = k - 2.\n\nSince k = 1 - 2x, a = (1 - 2x) - 2 = -1 - 2x.\n\nFrom equation 5: -c k = (-3x\u00b2 + 3x - 3/4).\n\nSo, c k = 3x\u00b2 - 3x + 3/4.\n\nThus, c = (3x\u00b2 - 3x + 3/4)/k.\n\nBut k = 1 - 2x, so c = (3x\u00b2 - 3x + 3/4)/(1 - 2x).\n\nFrom equation 4: c - b k = 6x\u00b2 -6x + 3/2.\n\nSo, c = b k + (6x\u00b2 -6x + 3/2).\n\nFrom equation 3: b - a k = (-4x\u00b2 + 3x + 1/4).\n\nWe have a = -1 -2x, so:\n\nb - (-1 -2x)k = (-4x\u00b2 + 3x + 1/4).\n\nWhich is:\n\nb + (1 + 2x)k = (-4x\u00b2 + 3x + 1/4).\n\nBut k = 1 - 2x, so:\n\nb + (1 + 2x)(1 - 2x) = (-4x\u00b2 + 3x + 1/4).\n\nCompute (1 + 2x)(1 - 2x) = 1 - (2x)^2 = 1 -4x\u00b2.\n\nSo:\n\nb + (1 -4x\u00b2) = (-4x\u00b2 + 3x + 1/4).\n\nThus, b = (-4x\u00b2 +3x +1/4) - (1 -4x\u00b2) = (-4x\u00b2 +3x +1/4) -1 +4x\u00b2 = 3x - 3/4.\n\nSo, b = 3x - 3/4.\n\nFrom equation 4: c = b k + (6x\u00b2 -6x + 3/2).\n\nSubstitute b = 3x - 3/4 and k =1 - 2x:\n\nc = (3x - 3/4)(1 - 2x) + (6x\u00b2 -6x + 3/2).\n\nCompute (3x - 3/4)(1 - 2x):\n\n= 3x(1) + 3x(-2x) - (3/4)(1) + (3/4)(2x)\n\n= 3x -6x\u00b2 - 3/4 + (3/2)x\n\n= (3x + (3/2)x) + (-6x\u00b2) + (-3/4)\n\n= (9/2 x) -6x\u00b2 -3/4.\n\nSo, c = (9/2 x -6x\u00b2 -3/4) + (6x\u00b2 -6x + 3/2).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-6x\u00b2 +6x\u00b2 = 0.\n\n9/2 x -6x = 9/2 x -12/2 x = (-3/2)x.\n\n-3/4 + 3/2 = (-3/4 +6/4) = 3/4.\n\nSo, c = (-3/2 x) + 3/4.\n\nBut from equation 5, c = (3x\u00b2 -3x +3/4)/(1 -2x).\n\nSo, equate the two expressions for c:\n\n(-3/2 x + 3/4) = (3x\u00b2 -3x +3/4)/(1 -2x).\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 - 2x):\n\n(-3/2 x + 3/4)(1 - 2x) = 3x\u00b2 -3x +3/4.\n\nExpand the left side:\n\n-3/2 x *1 + (-3/2 x)*(-2x) + 3/4 *1 + 3/4*(-2x)\n\n= -3/2 x + 3x\u00b2 + 3/4 - 3/2 x.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3x\u00b2 + (-3/2 x -3/2 x) + 3/4.\n\n= 3x\u00b2 -3x + 3/4.\n\nWhich equals the right side: 3x\u00b2 -3x +3/4.\n\nSo, the equality holds. Thus, our quartic can be factored as (t - k)(t^3 + a t^2 + b t + c) = 0, where k =1 -2x, a= -1 -2x, b=3x -3/4, c= -3/2 x +3/4.\n\nSo, the quartic factors into (t - (1 -2x))(t^3 + (-1 -2x) t^2 + (3x -3/4)t + (-3/2 x +3/4)) =0.\n\nSo, the quartic equation has t =1 -2x as a root, which corresponds to PQ being AB. The other roots are solutions to the cubic equation:\n\nt^3 + (-1 -2x) t^2 + (3x -3/4)t + (-3/2 x +3/4) =0.\n\nWe are interested in whether there exists another t \u2208 (0,1) besides t =1 -2x. So, for point C to not lie on any other PQ, the cubic equation must have no real roots in (0,1) except possibly t=1 -2x. But since we've factored out (t -k), the cubic may have other roots.\n\nBut perhaps for our point C, the cubic has no real roots in t \u2208 (0,1), meaning that the only solution is t =k, which is the AB segment.\n\nSo, to ensure that, the cubic equation must not have any roots in (0,1) other than possibly t =k.\n\nBut since t =k is already a root, but in the quartic, it's only a simple root. Hmm, perhaps I should check the cubic for other roots.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use calculus to analyze the cubic function.\n\nLet me denote f(t) = t^3 + (-1 -2x) t^2 + (3x -3/4)t + (-3/2 x +3/4).\n\nWe need to check whether f(t) has any roots in (0,1).\n\nIf f(t) does not cross zero in (0,1), except possibly at t =k, then C doesn't lie on any other PQ.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the derivative of f(t) to find its extrema and see if it crosses zero.\n\nCompute f'(t) = 3t^2 + 2*(-1 -2x)t + (3x -3/4).\n\n= 3t^2 - 2(1 + 2x) t + 3x -3/4.\n\nSet f'(t) =0 to find critical points.\n\nDiscriminant D = [ -2(1 + 2x) ]^2 -4*3*(3x -3/4).\n\n= 4(1 + 2x)^2 -12(3x -3/4).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4(1 +4x +4x\u00b2) = 4 +16x +16x\u00b2.\n\n12(3x -3/4) = 36x -9.\n\nSo, D = (4 +16x +16x\u00b2) - (36x -9) = 4 +16x +16x\u00b2 -36x +9 = 16x\u00b2 -20x +13.\n\nSo, discriminant D = 16x\u00b2 -20x +13.\n\nWe can compute whether D is positive, zero, or negative.\n\nCompute discriminant of D: ( -20 )^2 -4*16*13 =400 -832= -432 <0.\n\nSo, D is always positive because the quadratic in x has negative discriminant, and the coefficient of x\u00b2 is positive (16). So, D is always positive. Thus, f'(t)=0 has two real roots.\n\nSo, f(t) has two critical points. Let me denote them t1 and t2, where t1 < t2.\n\nTo find whether f(t) crosses zero in (0,1), we can compute f(0) and f(1), and see the behavior.\n\nCompute f(0) = 0 +0 +0 + (-3/2 x +3/4) = (-3/2 x + 3/4).\n\nCompute f(1) =1 + (-1 -2x) + (3x -3/4) + (-3/2 x +3/4).\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n1 -1 -2x +3x -3/4 -3/2 x +3/4.\n\nCombine constants: 1 -1 =0. -3/4 +3/4=0.\n\nCombine x terms: (-2x +3x -3/2 x) = (-2x +3x) =x; x - 3/2 x= -1/2 x.\n\nSo, f(1) = (-1/2)x.\n\nSo, f(0) = (-3/2 x + 3/4).\n\nf(1) = (-1/2 x).\n\nSo, the behavior at the endpoints:\n\nAt t=0, f(0)= (-3/2 x +3/4).\n\nAt t=1, f(1)= (-1/2 x).\n\nSo, depending on x, f(0) and f(1) can be positive or negative.\n\nWe can analyze the sign of f(0) and f(1):\n\nf(0) = (-3/2 x +3/4). So, f(0) =0 when x = (3/4)/(3/2)= (3/4)*(2/3)=1/2. So, f(0) is positive when x <1/2, negative when x>1/2.\n\nSimilarly, f(1)= (-1/2 x). So, f(1) is positive when x<0, but x is between 0 and1/2, so f(1) is negative for x>0.\n\nSo, at t=0, f(0) is positive if x <1/2, negative if x>1/2.\n\nAt t=1, f(1) is negative.\n\nSo, depending on x, the function f(t) may cross zero in (0,1).\n\nWe can consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: x <1/2.\n\nThen, f(0) = (-3/2 x +3/4) >0, since x <1/2.\n\nf(1) = (-1/2 x) <0, since x>0.\n\nSo, f(t) goes from positive at t=0 to negative at t=1. So, by Intermediate Value Theorem, there is at least one root in (0,1). But in our quartic, we already have t=k as a root, which is in (0,1) only if k \u2208 (0,1).\n\nSince k =1 -2x, and x is in (0,1/2), k is in (0,1).\n\nSo, if x <1/2, then f(t) has a root at t=k, which is in (0,1), and since f(t) goes from positive to negative, there must be another root in (0,1). So, in this case, C lies on another PQ, which is not AB. But we want to find a C that doesn't lie on any other PQ. So, x cannot be less than 1/2.\n\nWait, but x is on AB, so x ranges from 0 to1/2. So, x <1/2 is the entire domain except x=1/2, which is point A.\n\nWait, but when x=1/2, f(t) is?\n\nAt x=1/2, f(t)= t^3 + (-1 -1) t^2 + (3*(1/2) -3/4) t + (-3/2*(1/2) +3/4).\n\nSimplify:\n\nt^3 -2 t^2 + (3/2 -3/4) t + (-3/4 +3/4).\n\nWhich is t^3 -2t^2 + (3/4) t +0.\n\nSo, f(t)= t^3 -2t^2 + (3/4)t.\n\nFactor:\n\nt(t^2 -2t +3/4)=0.\n\nSolutions t=0, and t=(2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 -3))/2 = (2 \u00b11)/2 \u2192 t= 3/2 or t=1/2.\n\nBut t must be in (0,1). So, t=1/2 is a solution.\n\nThus, at x=1/2, f(t)=0 at t=1/2, which is point A. But since we're looking for C not being A or B, we can ignore x=1/2.\n\nSo, for x <1/2, f(t) has another root in (0,1), so C lies on another PQ, which we don't want. So, to have C not lie on any other PQ, x must be such that f(t) has no roots in (0,1) other than t=k.\n\nWait, but for x <1/2, f(t) has another root, so that's not acceptable. So, perhaps the only x where f(t) doesn't have another root is when x >=1/2? But x can't be >=1/2 on AB, because AB is from x=0 to x=1/2.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the analysis.\n\nWait, when x <1/2, f(0) is positive, f(1) is negative, so by IVT, there's at least one root in (0,1). But t=k is already a root in (0,1). So, the quartic equation has two roots in (0,1): t=k and another t.\n\nThus, for x <1/2, C lies on two PQ segments: AB and another one.\n\nBut we need C to lie on only AB. So, the only way this can happen is if the other root is not in (0,1). So, perhaps when f(t) does not cross zero again, i.e., when the cubic f(t) doesn't have another root in (0,1).\n\nBut how can that happen?\n\nWait, perhaps when x >=1/2, but x is on AB, so x can't be more than1/2.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps when x=1/2, which is point A, but we don't want C to be A or B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when x is such that the cubic f(t) has a double root at t=k, meaning that t=k is a multiple root.\n\nSo, if t=k is a double root, then the cubic f(t) is divisible by (t -k)^2.\n\nSo, let's check if (t -k)^2 is a factor of f(t).\n\nWe can perform polynomial division again, but that's time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that if t=k is a multiple root, then f(k)=0 and f\u2019(k)=0.\n\nSo, let's compute f(k) and f\u2019(k).\n\nWe already have f(k)=0 because t=k is a root.\n\nCompute f\u2019(k):\n\nf\u2019(t)=3t\u00b2 -2(1 +2x)t +3x -3/4.\n\nAt t=k=1-2x:\n\nf\u2019(k)=3k\u00b2 -2(1 +2x)k +3x -3/4.\n\nSubstitute k=1-2x:\n\n=3(1-2x)^2 -2(1+2x)(1-2x) +3x -3/4.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n3(1 -4x +4x\u00b2) =3 -12x +12x\u00b2.\n\n-2(1 +2x)(1 -2x)= -2(1 -4x\u00b2)= -2 +8x\u00b2.\n\nSo, adding them:\n\n3 -12x +12x\u00b2 -2 +8x\u00b2 +3x -3/4.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3 -2=1.\n\n-12x +3x= -9x.\n\n12x\u00b2 +8x\u00b2=20x\u00b2.\n\n-3/4.\n\nSo, total is:\n\n20x\u00b2 -9x +1 -3/4 =20x\u00b2 -9x +1/4.\n\nSet f\u2019(k)=0:\n\n20x\u00b2 -9x +1/4=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by4:\n\n80x\u00b2 -36x +1=0.\n\nSolve for x using quadratic formula:\n\nx = [36 \u00b1 sqrt(1296 - 320)] / 160.\n\nCompute discriminant: 1296 -320=976.\n\nsqrt(976)=sqrt(16*61)=4*sqrt(61).\n\nSo, x=(36 \u00b14sqrt(61))/160.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx=(9 \u00b1sqrt(61))/40.\n\nCompute approximate values:\n\nsqrt(61)\u22487.81.\n\nSo,\n\nx1=(9 +7.81)/40\u224816.81/40\u22480.42.\n\nx2=(9 -7.81)/40\u22481.19/40\u22480.02975.\n\nBut since x is on AB, x \u2208 [0, 0.5].\n\nSo, x\u22480.42 and x\u22480.02975 are both in [0,0.5].\n\nSo, when x=(9 +sqrt(61))/40\u22480.42, and x=(9 -sqrt(61))/40\u22480.02975, f\u2019(k)=0.\n\nSo, these are the x where t=k is a double root.\n\nSo, for these x, t=k is a double root, meaning that f(t) has a double root at t=k and possibly another root.\n\nBut in our case, we want the point C to lie only on AB, i.e., to have no other t \u2208(0,1) such that C lies on PQ.\n\nSo, if at x=(9 \u00b1sqrt(61))/40, t=k is a double root, and the cubic f(t) may have another root.\n\nWait, but if t=k is a double root, then the cubic can be written as (t -k)^2 (t - m) =0.\n\nSo, we can find m.\n\nBut perhaps instead of doing that, let's think about when x=(9 \u00b1sqrt(61))/40, whether the cubic f(t) has another root in (0,1).\n\nLet me evaluate f(t) at x=(9 +sqrt(61))/40, which is approximately 0.42.\n\nCompute f(0) when x\u22480.42.\n\nf(0)= (-3/2 x +3/4)= (-1.5*0.42 +0.75)= (-0.63 +0.75)=0.12>0.\n\nf(1)= (-1/2 x)= (-0.5 *0.42)= -0.21<0.\n\nSo, f(0)=0.12, f(1)=-0.21.\n\nSo, since f(t) is positive at t=0 and negative at t=1, and it has a double root at t=k=1 -2x\u22481 -0.84=0.16.\n\nSo, t=k\u22480.16 is a double root. So, the cubic f(t) would have another root, say t=m.\n\nBut let's see where m is.\n\nIf the cubic has a double root at t\u22480.16 and another root, let's see the behavior.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m is greater than1 or less than0, but given that f(0)=0.12>0 and f(1)=-0.21<0, and the double root at t\u22480.16, the function f(t) would cross zero once more in (0,1). So, there would be another root.\n\nThus, point C would lie on another PQ segment, which we don't want.\n\nSo, perhaps the only way to have C not lie on any other PQ is when the cubic f(t) does not cross zero in (0,1). But for x <1/2, f(t) does cross zero.\n\nWait, unless x is such that f(t) doesn't cross zero, which would happen if f(t) doesn't change sign in (0,1). But for x <1/2, f(0) is positive and f(1) is negative, so it must cross zero.\n\nThus, the only way for C not to lie on any other PQ is when x >=1/2, but since on AB, x can't be more than1/2, except at point A. But C is supposed to be distinct from A and B.\n\nWait, perhaps the point C is such that f(t) has a double root at t=k, meaning that the other root is either at t=k or outside (0,1). But in our earlier case, when x=(9 +sqrt(61))/40\u22480.42, which is less than1/2, the cubic f(t) still has another root in (0,1). So, C would lie on another PQ.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nAnother approach: The envelope of the family of lines PQ.\n\nThe envelope is a curve that is tangent to each PQ at some point. So, perhaps the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope.\n\nThe envelope can be found by solving the system:\n\nF(p, q, t) = x = p(1 - t)\n\nG(p, q, t) = y = q t\n\nH(p, q) = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nThe envelope is found by solving the system F=G=H=0, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact method.\n\nAlternatively, the envelope can be found by eliminating parameters p and q.\n\nFrom F and G, we have p = x/(1 - t), q = y/t.\n\nSubstitute into H: (x\u00b2)/(1 - t)^2 + (y\u00b2)/(t^2) =1.\n\nThis is the same equation we had earlier.\n\nTo find the envelope, we can differentiate this equation with respect to t and solve for t.\n\nSo, let's compute d/dt [x\u00b2/(1 - t)^2 + y\u00b2/t\u00b2] =0.\n\nCompute derivative:\n\nd/dt [x\u00b2/(1 - t)^2] = x\u00b2 * 2(1 - t)^(-3) * (1) = 2 x\u00b2/(1 - t)^3.\n\nd/dt [y\u00b2/t\u00b2] = y\u00b2*(-2)/t^3.\n\nSo, 2x\u00b2/(1 - t)^3 - 2 y\u00b2 / t^3 =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2/(1 - t)^3 = y\u00b2/t^3.\n\nTake cube roots:\n\nx/(1 - t) = y/t.\n\nSo, x t = y (1 - t).\n\nx t + y t = y.\n\nt(x + y) = y.\n\nt = y/(x + y).\n\nSo, the envelope is found where t = y/(x + y).\n\nSubstitute back into the original equation:\n\nx\u00b2/(1 - t)^2 + y\u00b2/t\u00b2 =1.\n\nPlug t = y/(x + y):\n\nCompute 1 - t = (x + y - y)/(x + y) =x/(x + y).\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2/(x/(x + y))^2 + y\u00b2/(y/(x + y))^2 =1.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nx\u00b2/(x\u00b2/(x + y)^2) = (x\u00b2)*(x + y)^2 /x\u00b2 = (x + y)^2.\n\nSimilarly, y\u00b2/(y\u00b2/(x + y)^2) = (x + y)^2.\n\nSo, (x + y)^2 + (x + y)^2 =1.\n\nSo, 2(x + y)^2 =1.\n\nThus, (x + y)^2 =1/2.\n\nSo, x + y =1/\u221a2.\n\nBut since we're in the first quadrant, x + y is positive.\n\nThus, the envelope is the line x + y =1/\u221a2.\n\nSo, the envelope of all PQ segments is the line x + y =1/\u221a2.\n\nSo, AB is supposed to be tangent to this envelope at point C.\n\nSo, point C is the point of tangency between AB and the envelope x + y =1/\u221a2.\n\nSo, to find point C, we can find the intersection of AB and the envelope, and ensure that they are tangent, i.e., have only one intersection point.\n\nWait, but AB is a straight line, and the envelope is also a straight line. So, two straight lines can either be parallel or intersect at a single point.\n\nBut in our case, since AB is not parallel to the envelope, they must intersect at exactly one point, which would be the point of tangency.\n\nWait, but if AB is tangent to the envelope, which is another line, then they must coincide? Wait, no, two lines can't be tangent unless they're the same line.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. The envelope is a line, and AB is another line. So, if AB is tangent to the envelope, then AB must coincide with the envelope, which is not the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, the envelope is the set of points where each PQ is tangent to the envelope curve. But in this case, the envelope turned out to be a straight line, which doesn't make sense because each PQ is a segment of a line, and their envelope is another line. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the envelope is not a straight line, but a curve.\n\nWait, no, earlier, when I derived the envelope condition, I found that the envelope is x + y =1/\u221a2. But that seems to be a straight line.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the differentiation step.\n\nWait, let me double-check.\n\nWe have the equation x\u00b2/(1 - t)^2 + y\u00b2/t\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe treated x and y as variables, but in reality, for each PQ, x and y are fixed, and t is a parameter.\n\nWait, no, actually, for the envelope, x and y are variables depending on t, so perhaps I should treat x and y as functions of t.\n\nWait, perhaps the envelope is a curve in the plane, so for each t, we have a point (x(t), y(t)) on the envelope.\n\nWait, let me think differently.\n\nThe envelope is found by solving the system:\n\nF(p, q, t) = x = p(1 - t)\n\nG(p, q, t) = y = q t\n\nH(p, q) = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nEliminating p and q.\n\nFrom F and G:\n\np = x/(1 - t)\n\nq = y/t.\n\nSubstitute into H:\n\n(x/(1 - t))\u00b2 + (y/t)^2 =1.\n\nSo, the envelope is the set of (x, y) such that there exists t where (x/(1 - t))\u00b2 + (y/t)^2 =1.\n\nBut to find the envelope, we also need to take the derivative with respect to t and set it to zero.\n\nWait, I think I did that correctly earlier, leading to x + y =1/\u221a2.\n\nBut if that's the case, then the envelope is the line x + y =1/\u221a2.\n\nBut that seems odd because each PQ is a line segment, and their envelope is another line.\n\nWait, perhaps the envelope is actually the union of all these segments, but that doesn't form a line.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to revisit the envelope concept.\n\nWait, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. In this case, the family is all the PQ segments.\n\nBut each PQ is a straight line segment. So, the envelope of all these segments is the region covered by all these segments.\n\nWait, but the envelope is the boundary of that region.\n\nWait, perhaps the envelope is the astroid formed by the endpoints moving along the axes with the constraint that PQ is of unit length.\n\nWait, I recall that the envelope of such segments is an astroid.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the envelope is an astroid, which is a curve given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = (a)^(2/3), where a is a constant.\n\nWait, let me confirm.\n\nIn general, for a family of lines x/p + y/q =1, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = constant, the envelope is an astroid.\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nSo, in our case, each PQ is a line segment x/p + y/q =1, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nSo, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nWait, let me check.\n\nThe standard astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = a^(2/3).\n\nIn our case, the envelope is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nSo, the astroid is given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nSo, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nSo, AB is a line segment from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). We need to find the point C where AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nSo, point C is the point of tangency between AB and the astroid.\n\nSo, to find C, we can parametrize AB and find where it is tangent to the astroid.\n\nParametrizing AB as earlier: (x, y) = (1/2 (1 - s), sqrt(3)/2 s), where s \u2208 [0,1].\n\nWe need to find s such that the line AB is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1 at point C.\n\nThe condition for tangency is that the line AB is tangent to the astroid at C.\n\nSo, let's write the equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe can find the condition that this line is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nTo find the condition for tangency, we can use the fact that the gradient of the astroid at point C is perpendicular to the direction vector of AB.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the condition that the system of the astroid and AB has exactly one solution.\n\nSo, substitute y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 into x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nSo, x^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) =1.\n\nLet me denote z =x.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nz^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3) z + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) =1.\n\nThis is complicated, but perhaps we can make a substitution.\n\nLet me factor sqrt(3)/2 from the second term:\n\n= z^(2/3) + [ sqrt(3)/2 (-2z +1) ]^(2/3) =1.\n\n= z^(2/3) + (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3) * (-2z +1)^(2/3) =1.\n\nCompute (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3):\n\nsqrt(3)=3^(1/2), so (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3)=3^(1/3)/2^(2/3).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nz^(2/3) + [3^(1/3)/2^(2/3)] * (-2z +1)^(2/3) =1.\n\nLet me denote k=3^(1/3)/2^(2/3).\n\nSo, equation: z^(2/3) +k*(-2z +1)^(2/3)=1.\n\nLet me set u= z^(1/3), v=(-2z +1)^(1/3).\n\nThen, z= u^3, -2z +1= v^3.\n\nSo, from -2z +1= v^3,\n\n-2u^3 +1= v^3.\n\nAlso, the equation becomes u\u00b2 +k v\u00b2=1.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1. u\u00b2 +k v\u00b2 =1.\n\n2. v^3 +2u^3=1.\n\nWe can write equation 2 as v^3=1 -2u^3.\n\nFrom equation 1: v\u00b2=(1 - u\u00b2)/k.\n\nSo, v= sqrt[(1 -u\u00b2)/k].\n\nBut since v is real, (1 -u\u00b2)/k >=0.\n\nSo, 1 -u\u00b2 >=0 \u2192 |u| <=1.\n\nBut since z is in [0,1/2], u= z^(1/3) is in [0, (1/2)^(1/3)] \u2248 [0, 0.7937].\n\nSo, u is positive and less than1.\n\nSo, v= sqrt[(1 -u\u00b2)/k].\n\nBut v^3=1 -2u^3.\n\nSo, [sqrt((1 -u\u00b2)/k)]^3=1 -2u^3.\n\nSimplify:\n\n[(1 -u\u00b2)/k]^(3/2) =1 -2u^3.\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 2/3:\n\n(1 -u\u00b2)/k = [1 -2u^3]^(2/3).\n\nSo,\n\n(1 -u\u00b2) =k [1 -2u^3]^(2/3).\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to find a relationship between u and v.\n\nFrom equation 2: v^3 =1 -2u^3.\n\nFrom equation 1: v\u00b2= (1 -u\u00b2)/k.\n\nLet me write equation 2 as v^3 =1 -2u^3.\n\nExpress v from equation 1: v= sqrt[(1 -u\u00b2)/k].\n\nSo, substitute into equation 2:\n\n[ sqrt((1 -u\u00b2)/k) ]^3 =1 -2u^3.\n\nSimplify:\n\n[(1 -u\u00b2)/k]^(3/2) =1 -2u^3.\n\nThis is a complicated equation, but perhaps we can cube both sides to eliminate the exponents.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to make a substitution.\n\nLet me let w =u^3.\n\nThen, u= w^(1/3).\n\nSo, 1 -u\u00b2=1 -w^(2/3).\n\nSimilarly, 1 -2u^3=1 -2w.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n[(1 -w^(2/3))/k]^(3/2) =1 -2w.\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 2/3:\n\n(1 -w^(2/3))/k = [1 -2w]^(2/3).\n\nHmm, still complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can assume a specific relationship between u and v.\n\nWait, another approach: Since AB is tangent to the astroid at C, the derivative of the astroid at C must equal the slope of AB.\n\nSlope of AB is -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, compute dy/dx of the astroid at point C.\n\nThe astroid equation is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nDifferentiate implicitly:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx =0.\n\nSo,\n\ndy/dx = - [x^(-1/3)] / [y^(-1/3)] = - (y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)).\n\nSo, slope of the astroid at point C is - (y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)).\n\nThis must equal the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\n(y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)) = sqrt(3).\n\nRaise both sides to the power of3:\n\n(y)/(x)= (sqrt(3))^3= 3*sqrt(3).\n\nSo, y=3 sqrt(3) x.\n\nBut point C lies on AB, which has equation y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, set 3 sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n3 sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nFactor sqrt(3) x:\n\nsqrt(3) x (3 +1) = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(3) x *4 = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n4x =1/2 \u2192 x=1/8.\n\nSo, x=1/8.\n\nThen, y=3 sqrt(3) * (1/8)= 3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nWait, but let's check if this point lies on AB.\n\nAB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAt x=1/8,\n\ny= -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2= (-sqrt(3)/8 +4 sqrt(3)/8)=3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nYes, so point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nSo, OC\u00b2 is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 =1/64 + (27)/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nSo, OC\u00b2=7/16. So, p=7, q=16, p+q=23.\n\nWait, but let me verify.\n\nWait, in our earlier steps, we set the slope of the astroid at C equal to the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).\n\nFrom the astroid, dy/dx= - (y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)).\n\nSet equal to -sqrt(3):\n\n(y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3))=sqrt(3).\n\nSo, y= (sqrt(3))^3 x= 3 sqrt(3) x.\n\nSo, y=3 sqrt(3) x.\n\nBut point C is on AB, which is y= -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, solving 3 sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nBring terms together:\n\n3 sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) x= sqrt(3)/2.\n\n4 sqrt(3) x= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n4x=1/2 \u2192 x=1/8.\n\nThen, y=3 sqrt(3)*(1/8)=3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo, C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nCompute OC\u00b2= (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 =1/64 + (27)/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nYes, so OC\u00b2=7/16.\n\nThus, p=7, q=16, which are coprime.\n\nSo, p+q=23.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we first identify the family of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. The line AB connects A(1/2, 0) and B(0, \u221a3/2) and has a length of 1, making it a member of the family F. We need to find a unique point C on AB that does not lie on any other segment from F except AB.\n\nThe equation of line AB is derived as y = -\u221a3x + \u221a3/2. The envelope of the family F forms an astroid given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1. For point C to be the unique point where AB is tangent to this astroid, we set the slope of AB equal to the derivative of the astroid at C.\n\nThe slope of AB is -\u221a3. The derivative of the astroid at any point (x, y) is dy/dx = -(y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)). Setting this equal to -\u221a3, we find y = 3\u221a3 x. Solving this with the equation of AB, we find the coordinates of C as (1/8, 3\u221a3/8). Calculating OC\u00b2 gives us (1/8)\u00b2 + (3\u221a3/8)\u00b2 = 7/16. Thus, p = 7 and q = 16, leading to p + q = 23.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{23}",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step.\n\nFirst, the points are given as O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis at (1/2, 0), and B is on the y-axis at (0, sqrt(3)/2). Then, there's a family F of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ has length 1, starts at some point P on the x-axis, ends at some point Q on the y-axis, and lies entirely in the first quadrant.\n\nNow, the problem is about a point C on AB, other than A and B, that isn't on any other segment from F except AB itself. So, AB is one such segment in F, right? Because A is on the x-axis and B is on the y-axis, and the distance between A and B should be 1 unit. Let me verify that.\n\nDistance between A and B: sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. Yes, so AB is indeed a segment of length 1 in F.\n\nSo, F is a family of all such segments PQ with unit length in the first quadrant. The point C is on AB, but not on any other segment from F except AB. So, C is unique in that sense.\n\nWe need to find OC\u00b2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.\n\nHmm. So, maybe I can parametrize point C on AB and find conditions where it doesn't lie on any other PQ from F.\n\nFirst, let me find the equation of line AB. Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2), which simplifies to y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) where x is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nSo, point C is (x, y) = (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2).\n\nNow, the problem is that C should not lie on any other segment PQ in F except AB. So, we need to ensure that for all other segments PQ in F, the point C is not on PQ. Except for AB, of course.\n\nWhat defines a segment PQ in F? It's a segment from P(p, 0) to Q(0, q), where p and q are positive real numbers such that the distance between P and Q is 1. So, the distance PQ is sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, which implies p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, for any such P(p, 0) and Q(0, q), the segment PQ connects (p,0) to (0,q), and lies in the first quadrant.\n\nNow, to find if a point C lies on PQ, we can parametrize PQ.\n\nParametric equations for PQ: Any point on PQ can be written as (p - tp, tq) where t ranges from 0 to 1. Wait, maybe it's better to write it in terms of a parameter s, where s goes from 0 to 1.\n\nSo, the parametric form is (p(1 - s), q s), where s \u2208 [0,1]. When s=0, we're at P(p,0), and s=1, we're at Q(0,q).\n\nSo, if point C lies on PQ, then there exists some s \u2208 [0,1] such that:\n\nx = p(1 - s)\n\ny = q s\n\nBut since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, because PQ is of unit length.\n\nSo, given point C(x, y), if there exist p, q, s with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, s \u2208 [0,1], such that x = p(1 - s) and y = q s, then C lies on PQ.\n\nBut in our case, C lies on AB, and we want to find the unique C on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ except AB.\n\nSo, for all other PQ in F, the system of equations:\n\nx = p(1 - s)\n\ny = q s\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1\n\nhas no solution in p, q, s with s \u2208 [0,1], except when PQ is AB itself.\n\nSo, to find such a C, we need to find a point (x, y) on AB such that the system above only has a solution when PQ is AB.\n\nAlternatively, for any other PQ, this system should have no solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the envelope of all such PQ segments, and the point C is the point where AB is tangent to this envelope.\n\nWait, that might be a useful approach. The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, perhaps the envelope of all PQ in F is a curve, and AB is tangent to this envelope at point C. Then, point C would be the point where AB touches the envelope, and hence, it's the only point on AB that lies on the envelope, so it's the only point on AB that's on any PQ except AB itself. Hmm, maybe.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe we can think in terms of duality or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize PQ segments and find for which C the system has a solution.\n\nLet me try this.\n\nLet me suppose that point C(x, y) is on AB, so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe want to see if there exists p, q, s such that x = p(1 - s), y = q s, and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe can express p and q in terms of x and y.\n\nFrom x = p(1 - s) and y = q s, we can write p = x / (1 - s) and q = y / s.\n\nBut since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, substituting gives (x\u00b2)/(1 - s)^2 + (y\u00b2)/(s)^2 = 1.\n\nSo, for each C(x, y), we can consider whether there exists an s \u2208 (0,1) such that (x\u00b2)/(1 - s)^2 + (y\u00b2)/(s)^2 = 1.\n\nIf for some s, this equation holds, then C lies on the corresponding PQ.\n\nWe want to find C on AB such that this equation has no solution except when PQ is AB itself.\n\nSo, if we substitute y from AB into this equation, we can get an equation in x and s, and then find conditions when this equation has no solution except for the case when PQ is AB.\n\nWait, but when PQ is AB, what's s?\n\nFor AB, P is (1/2, 0), Q is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, in terms of parametrization, s would be such that x = (1/2)(1 - s), y = (sqrt(3)/2) s.\n\nSo, from point C being on AB, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. So, substituting x = (1/2)(1 - s), we get y = -sqrt(3)*(1/2)(1 - s) + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWhich is y = (-sqrt(3)/2 + (sqrt(3)/2)s) + sqrt(3)/2 = (sqrt(3)/2)s. Which matches the y = (sqrt(3)/2) s from PQ.\n\nSo, for AB, s is the parameter that moves from 0 to 1 along AB.\n\nBut for other PQ segments, s would vary, but for each such segment, we can have a different s.\n\nWait, but for a general C on AB, we can write x and y in terms of s, but in this problem, s is a parameter for each PQ segment.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of s as a variable for each PQ segment, and for each PQ, s can be in [0,1]. So, for each PQ, there's a different s. But for our point C(x, y), if there exists an s such that (x^2)/(1 - s)^2 + (y^2)/(s^2) = 1, then C lies on that PQ.\n\nSo, to find points C on AB where this equation has no solution for s \u2208 (0,1), except when PQ is AB.\n\nSo, let's substitute y from AB into the equation.\n\nFrom AB: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nLet me denote x as x, and y as -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting into (x\u00b2)/(1 - s)^2 + (y\u00b2)/(s\u00b2) = 1:\n\n(x\u00b2)/(1 - s)^2 + [(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)^2]/(s^2) = 1.\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n[(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)^2] = (sqrt(3))^2 (x - 1/2)^2 = 3(x - 1/2)^2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2/(1 - s)^2 + 3(x - 1/2)^2 / s\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n[x\u00b2]/(1 - s)^2 + [3(x - 1/2)^2]/s\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe can think of this as an equation in s, for a given x.\n\nWe need to find x such that this equation has no solution s \u2208 (0,1), except when s is such that the PQ is AB.\n\nWait, but when PQ is AB, what is s?\n\nFrom AB's parametrization, when s = 1, we reach Q, which is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Wait, no, actually, when s is 1, x = p(1 - 1) = 0, which is point Q.\n\nWait, maybe I should parametrize AB differently.\n\nWait, in AB, P is (1/2, 0), Q is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, for AB, the parametrization is (1/2 (1 - s), sqrt(3)/2 s), where s \u2208 [0,1].\n\nSo, for point C on AB, it's (1/2 (1 - s), sqrt(3)/2 s).\n\nSo, in our earlier substitution, for AB, s is the parameter.\n\nWait, but in the general case, for any PQ, we have x = p(1 - s), y = q s, and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, for point C on AB, the question is: does there exist s \u2208 (0,1) and p, q such that p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, x = p(1 - s), y = q s, and C is not on AB.\n\nWait, but C is on AB, so the only solution is when PQ is AB. So, we need to ensure that for other PQs, there's no s that satisfies the equation.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to approach this is to set up the equation and find the x for which the equation has no solution in s, except when PQ is AB.\n\nSo, let's consider the equation:\n\nx\u00b2/(1 - s)^2 + 3(x - 1/2)^2 / s\u00b2 = 1.\n\nLet me denote t = s. So, t is in (0,1).\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nx\u00b2/(1 - t)^2 + 3(x - 1/2)^2 / t\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe can think of this as an equation in t. For each x, we can attempt to solve for t.\n\nWe can write this equation as:\n\nx\u00b2/(1 - t)^2 + 3(x - 1/2)^2 / t\u00b2 = 1.\n\nLet me denote A = x\u00b2, B = 3(x - 1/2)^2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA/(1 - t)^2 + B/t\u00b2 = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 - t)^2 t\u00b2:\n\nA t\u00b2 + B (1 - t)^2 = (1 - t)^2 t\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps expanding both sides.\n\nLeft side: A t\u00b2 + B (1 - 2t + t\u00b2) = A t\u00b2 + B - 2 B t + B t\u00b2.\n\nRight side: (1 - 2t + t\u00b2) t\u00b2 = t\u00b2 - 2 t^3 + t^4.\n\nSo, moving all terms to one side:\n\nA t\u00b2 + B - 2 B t + B t\u00b2 - t\u00b2 + 2 t^3 - t^4 = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-1) t^4 + 2 t^3 + (A + B - 1) t\u00b2 - 2 B t + B = 0.\n\nSo, we have a quartic equation in t:\n\n- t^4 + 2 t^3 + (A + B - 1) t\u00b2 - 2 B t + B = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make it positive leading coefficient:\n\nt^4 - 2 t^3 + (-A - B + 1) t\u00b2 + 2 B t - B = 0.\n\nSubstituting back A = x\u00b2 and B = 3(x - 1/2)^2:\n\nt^4 - 2 t^3 + (-x\u00b2 - 3(x - 1/2)^2 + 1) t\u00b2 + 6(x - 1/2)^2 t - 3(x - 1/2)^2 = 0.\n\nLet me compute each coefficient step by step.\n\nFirst, compute coefficient of t^4: 1.\n\nCoefficient of t^3: -2.\n\nCoefficient of t^2: (-x\u00b2 - 3(x - 1/2)^2 + 1).\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n- x\u00b2 - 3(x\u00b2 - x + 1/4) + 1.\n\n= -x\u00b2 - 3x\u00b2 + 3x - 3/4 + 1.\n\n= (-1 -3) x\u00b2 + 3x + (-3/4 + 1).\n\n= -4x\u00b2 + 3x + 1/4.\n\nCoefficient of t^2: (-4x\u00b2 + 3x + 1/4).\n\nCoefficient of t: 6(x - 1/2)^2.\n\nWhich is 6(x\u00b2 - x + 1/4) = 6x\u00b2 - 6x + 3/2.\n\nConstant term: -3(x - 1/2)^2.\n\nWhich is -3x\u00b2 + 3x - 3/4.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the quartic equation is:\n\nt^4 - 2 t^3 + (-4x\u00b2 + 3x + 1/4) t\u00b2 + (6x\u00b2 - 6x + 3/2) t + (-3x\u00b2 + 3x - 3/4) = 0.\n\nHmm, this is a quartic equation in t, which seems complicated. But perhaps we can factor it or find some structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of this as a quadratic in t\u00b2, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of this equation as having a double root or something.\n\nWait, but maybe we can consider that when PQ is AB, the equation should have a solution t = s, where s is the parameter for AB.\n\nIn AB's parametrization, for point C, x = (1/2)(1 - s), y = (sqrt(3)/2) s.\n\nSo, s = 1 - 2x.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nFrom x = (1/2)(1 - s), we have 2x = 1 - s => s = 1 - 2x.\n\nYes, so s = 1 - 2x.\n\nSo, in the quartic equation, t = s = 1 - 2x is a solution when PQ is AB.\n\nSo, perhaps (t - (1 - 2x)) is a factor of the quartic equation.\n\nLet me perform polynomial division to factor out (t - (1 - 2x)).\n\nWait, but this might be complicated, but let me try.\n\nLet me denote k = 1 - 2x, so the factor is (t - k).\n\nWe can write the quartic as (t - k)(t^3 + a t^2 + b t + c) = 0.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nt^4 + a t^3 + b t^2 + c t - k t^3 - a k t^2 - b k t - c k.\n\nComparing with the original quartic:\n\nt^4 - 2 t^3 + (-4x\u00b2 + 3x + 1/4) t\u00b2 + (6x\u00b2 - 6x + 3/2) t + (-3x\u00b2 + 3x - 3/4).\n\nSo, equate coefficients:\n\n1. Coefficient of t^4: 1 = 1, okay.\n\n2. Coefficient of t^3: a - k = -2.\n\n3. Coefficient of t^2: b - a k = (-4x\u00b2 + 3x + 1/4).\n\n4. Coefficient of t: c - b k = (6x\u00b2 - 6x + 3/2).\n\n5. Constant term: -c k = (-3x\u00b2 + 3x - 3/4).\n\nSo, let me write these equations step by step.\n\nFrom equation 2: a = k - 2.\n\nSince k = 1 - 2x, a = (1 - 2x) - 2 = -1 - 2x.\n\nFrom equation 5: -c k = (-3x\u00b2 + 3x - 3/4).\n\nSo, c k = 3x\u00b2 - 3x + 3/4.\n\nThus, c = (3x\u00b2 - 3x + 3/4)/k.\n\nBut k = 1 - 2x, so c = (3x\u00b2 - 3x + 3/4)/(1 - 2x).\n\nFrom equation 4: c - b k = 6x\u00b2 -6x + 3/2.\n\nSo, c = b k + (6x\u00b2 -6x + 3/2).\n\nFrom equation 3: b - a k = (-4x\u00b2 + 3x + 1/4).\n\nWe have a = -1 -2x, so:\n\nb - (-1 -2x)k = (-4x\u00b2 + 3x + 1/4).\n\nWhich is:\n\nb + (1 + 2x)k = (-4x\u00b2 + 3x + 1/4).\n\nBut k = 1 - 2x, so:\n\nb + (1 + 2x)(1 - 2x) = (-4x\u00b2 + 3x + 1/4).\n\nCompute (1 + 2x)(1 - 2x) = 1 - (2x)^2 = 1 -4x\u00b2.\n\nSo:\n\nb + (1 -4x\u00b2) = (-4x\u00b2 + 3x + 1/4).\n\nThus, b = (-4x\u00b2 +3x +1/4) - (1 -4x\u00b2) = (-4x\u00b2 +3x +1/4) -1 +4x\u00b2 = 3x - 3/4.\n\nSo, b = 3x - 3/4.\n\nFrom equation 4: c = b k + (6x\u00b2 -6x + 3/2).\n\nSubstitute b = 3x - 3/4 and k =1 - 2x:\n\nc = (3x - 3/4)(1 - 2x) + (6x\u00b2 -6x + 3/2).\n\nCompute (3x - 3/4)(1 - 2x):\n\n= 3x(1) + 3x(-2x) - (3/4)(1) + (3/4)(2x)\n\n= 3x -6x\u00b2 - 3/4 + (3/2)x\n\n= (3x + (3/2)x) + (-6x\u00b2) + (-3/4)\n\n= (9/2 x) -6x\u00b2 -3/4.\n\nSo, c = (9/2 x -6x\u00b2 -3/4) + (6x\u00b2 -6x + 3/2).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-6x\u00b2 +6x\u00b2 = 0.\n\n9/2 x -6x = 9/2 x -12/2 x = (-3/2)x.\n\n-3/4 + 3/2 = (-3/4 +6/4) = 3/4.\n\nSo, c = (-3/2 x) + 3/4.\n\nBut from equation 5, c = (3x\u00b2 -3x +3/4)/(1 -2x).\n\nSo, equate the two expressions for c:\n\n(-3/2 x + 3/4) = (3x\u00b2 -3x +3/4)/(1 -2x).\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 - 2x):\n\n(-3/2 x + 3/4)(1 - 2x) = 3x\u00b2 -3x +3/4.\n\nExpand the left side:\n\n-3/2 x *1 + (-3/2 x)*(-2x) + 3/4 *1 + 3/4*(-2x)\n\n= -3/2 x + 3x\u00b2 + 3/4 - 3/2 x.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3x\u00b2 + (-3/2 x -3/2 x) + 3/4.\n\n= 3x\u00b2 -3x + 3/4.\n\nWhich equals the right side: 3x\u00b2 -3x +3/4.\n\nSo, the equality holds. Thus, our quartic can be factored as (t - k)(t^3 + a t^2 + b t + c) = 0, where k =1 -2x, a= -1 -2x, b=3x -3/4, c= -3/2 x +3/4.\n\nSo, the quartic factors into (t - (1 -2x))(t^3 + (-1 -2x) t^2 + (3x -3/4)t + (-3/2 x +3/4)) =0.\n\nSo, the quartic equation has t =1 -2x as a root, which corresponds to PQ being AB. The other roots are solutions to the cubic equation:\n\nt^3 + (-1 -2x) t^2 + (3x -3/4)t + (-3/2 x +3/4) =0.\n\nWe are interested in whether there exists another t \u2208 (0,1) besides t =1 -2x. So, for point C to not lie on any other PQ, the cubic equation must have no real roots in (0,1) except possibly t=1 -2x. But since we've factored out (t -k), the cubic may have other roots.\n\nBut perhaps for our point C, the cubic has no real roots in t \u2208 (0,1), meaning that the only solution is t =k, which is the AB segment.\n\nSo, to ensure that, the cubic equation must not have any roots in (0,1) other than possibly t =k.\n\nBut since t =k is already a root, but in the quartic, it's only a simple root. Hmm, perhaps I should check the cubic for other roots.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use calculus to analyze the cubic function.\n\nLet me denote f(t) = t^3 + (-1 -2x) t^2 + (3x -3/4)t + (-3/2 x +3/4).\n\nWe need to check whether f(t) has any roots in (0,1).\n\nIf f(t) does not cross zero in (0,1), except possibly at t =k, then C doesn't lie on any other PQ.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the derivative of f(t) to find its extrema and see if it crosses zero.\n\nCompute f'(t) = 3t^2 + 2*(-1 -2x)t + (3x -3/4).\n\n= 3t^2 - 2(1 + 2x) t + 3x -3/4.\n\nSet f'(t) =0 to find critical points.\n\nDiscriminant D = [ -2(1 + 2x) ]^2 -4*3*(3x -3/4).\n\n= 4(1 + 2x)^2 -12(3x -3/4).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4(1 +4x +4x\u00b2) = 4 +16x +16x\u00b2.\n\n12(3x -3/4) = 36x -9.\n\nSo, D = (4 +16x +16x\u00b2) - (36x -9) = 4 +16x +16x\u00b2 -36x +9 = 16x\u00b2 -20x +13.\n\nSo, discriminant D = 16x\u00b2 -20x +13.\n\nWe can compute whether D is positive, zero, or negative.\n\nCompute discriminant of D: ( -20 )^2 -4*16*13 =400 -832= -432 <0.\n\nSo, D is always positive because the quadratic in x has negative discriminant, and the coefficient of x\u00b2 is positive (16). So, D is always positive. Thus, f'(t)=0 has two real roots.\n\nSo, f(t) has two critical points. Let me denote them t1 and t2, where t1 < t2.\n\nTo find whether f(t) crosses zero in (0,1), we can compute f(0) and f(1), and see the behavior.\n\nCompute f(0) = 0 +0 +0 + (-3/2 x +3/4) = (-3/2 x + 3/4).\n\nCompute f(1) =1 + (-1 -2x) + (3x -3/4) + (-3/2 x +3/4).\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n1 -1 -2x +3x -3/4 -3/2 x +3/4.\n\nCombine constants: 1 -1 =0. -3/4 +3/4=0.\n\nCombine x terms: (-2x +3x -3/2 x) = (-2x +3x) =x; x - 3/2 x= -1/2 x.\n\nSo, f(1) = (-1/2)x.\n\nSo, f(0) = (-3/2 x + 3/4).\n\nf(1) = (-1/2 x).\n\nSo, the behavior at the endpoints:\n\nAt t=0, f(0)= (-3/2 x +3/4).\n\nAt t=1, f(1)= (-1/2 x).\n\nSo, depending on x, f(0) and f(1) can be positive or negative.\n\nWe can analyze the sign of f(0) and f(1):\n\nf(0) = (-3/2 x +3/4). So, f(0) =0 when x = (3/4)/(3/2)= (3/4)*(2/3)=1/2. So, f(0) is positive when x <1/2, negative when x>1/2.\n\nSimilarly, f(1)= (-1/2 x). So, f(1) is positive when x<0, but x is between 0 and1/2, so f(1) is negative for x>0.\n\nSo, at t=0, f(0) is positive if x <1/2, negative if x>1/2.\n\nAt t=1, f(1) is negative.\n\nSo, depending on x, the function f(t) may cross zero in (0,1).\n\nWe can consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: x <1/2.\n\nThen, f(0) = (-3/2 x +3/4) >0, since x <1/2.\n\nf(1) = (-1/2 x) <0, since x>0.\n\nSo, f(t) goes from positive at t=0 to negative at t=1. So, by Intermediate Value Theorem, there is at least one root in (0,1). But in our quartic, we already have t=k as a root, which is in (0,1) only if k \u2208 (0,1).\n\nSince k =1 -2x, and x is in (0,1/2), k is in (0,1).\n\nSo, if x <1/2, then f(t) has a root at t=k, which is in (0,1), and since f(t) goes from positive to negative, there must be another root in (0,1). So, in this case, C lies on another PQ, which is not AB. But we want to find a C that doesn't lie on any other PQ. So, x cannot be less than 1/2.\n\nWait, but x is on AB, so x ranges from 0 to1/2. So, x <1/2 is the entire domain except x=1/2, which is point A.\n\nWait, but when x=1/2, f(t) is?\n\nAt x=1/2, f(t)= t^3 + (-1 -1) t^2 + (3*(1/2) -3/4) t + (-3/2*(1/2) +3/4).\n\nSimplify:\n\nt^3 -2 t^2 + (3/2 -3/4) t + (-3/4 +3/4).\n\nWhich is t^3 -2t^2 + (3/4) t +0.\n\nSo, f(t)= t^3 -2t^2 + (3/4)t.\n\nFactor:\n\nt(t^2 -2t +3/4)=0.\n\nSolutions t=0, and t=(2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 -3))/2 = (2 \u00b11)/2 \u2192 t= 3/2 or t=1/2.\n\nBut t must be in (0,1). So, t=1/2 is a solution.\n\nThus, at x=1/2, f(t)=0 at t=1/2, which is point A. But since we're looking for C not being A or B, we can ignore x=1/2.\n\nSo, for x <1/2, f(t) has another root in (0,1), so C lies on another PQ, which we don't want. So, to have C not lie on any other PQ, x must be such that f(t) has no roots in (0,1) other than t=k.\n\nWait, but for x <1/2, f(t) has another root, so that's not acceptable. So, perhaps the only x where f(t) doesn't have another root is when x >=1/2? But x can't be >=1/2 on AB, because AB is from x=0 to x=1/2.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the analysis.\n\nWait, when x <1/2, f(0) is positive, f(1) is negative, so by IVT, there's at least one root in (0,1). But t=k is already a root in (0,1). So, the quartic equation has two roots in (0,1): t=k and another t.\n\nThus, for x <1/2, C lies on two PQ segments: AB and another one.\n\nBut we need C to lie on only AB. So, the only way this can happen is if the other root is not in (0,1). So, perhaps when f(t) does not cross zero again, i.e., when the cubic f(t) doesn't have another root in (0,1).\n\nBut how can that happen?\n\nWait, perhaps when x >=1/2, but x is on AB, so x can't be more than1/2.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps when x=1/2, which is point A, but we don't want C to be A or B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when x is such that the cubic f(t) has a double root at t=k, meaning that t=k is a multiple root.\n\nSo, if t=k is a double root, then the cubic f(t) is divisible by (t -k)^2.\n\nSo, let's check if (t -k)^2 is a factor of f(t).\n\nWe can perform polynomial division again, but that's time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that if t=k is a multiple root, then f(k)=0 and f\u2019(k)=0.\n\nSo, let's compute f(k) and f\u2019(k).\n\nWe already have f(k)=0 because t=k is a root.\n\nCompute f\u2019(k):\n\nf\u2019(t)=3t\u00b2 -2(1 +2x)t +3x -3/4.\n\nAt t=k=1-2x:\n\nf\u2019(k)=3k\u00b2 -2(1 +2x)k +3x -3/4.\n\nSubstitute k=1-2x:\n\n=3(1-2x)^2 -2(1+2x)(1-2x) +3x -3/4.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n3(1 -4x +4x\u00b2) =3 -12x +12x\u00b2.\n\n-2(1 +2x)(1 -2x)= -2(1 -4x\u00b2)= -2 +8x\u00b2.\n\nSo, adding them:\n\n3 -12x +12x\u00b2 -2 +8x\u00b2 +3x -3/4.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3 -2=1.\n\n-12x +3x= -9x.\n\n12x\u00b2 +8x\u00b2=20x\u00b2.\n\n-3/4.\n\nSo, total is:\n\n20x\u00b2 -9x +1 -3/4 =20x\u00b2 -9x +1/4.\n\nSet f\u2019(k)=0:\n\n20x\u00b2 -9x +1/4=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by4:\n\n80x\u00b2 -36x +1=0.\n\nSolve for x using quadratic formula:\n\nx = [36 \u00b1 sqrt(1296 - 320)] / 160.\n\nCompute discriminant: 1296 -320=976.\n\nsqrt(976)=sqrt(16*61)=4*sqrt(61).\n\nSo, x=(36 \u00b14sqrt(61))/160.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx=(9 \u00b1sqrt(61))/40.\n\nCompute approximate values:\n\nsqrt(61)\u22487.81.\n\nSo,\n\nx1=(9 +7.81)/40\u224816.81/40\u22480.42.\n\nx2=(9 -7.81)/40\u22481.19/40\u22480.02975.\n\nBut since x is on AB, x \u2208 [0, 0.5].\n\nSo, x\u22480.42 and x\u22480.02975 are both in [0,0.5].\n\nSo, when x=(9 +sqrt(61))/40\u22480.42, and x=(9 -sqrt(61))/40\u22480.02975, f\u2019(k)=0.\n\nSo, these are the x where t=k is a double root.\n\nSo, for these x, t=k is a double root, meaning that f(t) has a double root at t=k and possibly another root.\n\nBut in our case, we want the point C to lie only on AB, i.e., to have no other t \u2208(0,1) such that C lies on PQ.\n\nSo, if at x=(9 \u00b1sqrt(61))/40, t=k is a double root, and the cubic f(t) may have another root.\n\nWait, but if t=k is a double root, then the cubic can be written as (t -k)^2 (t - m) =0.\n\nSo, we can find m.\n\nBut perhaps instead of doing that, let's think about when x=(9 \u00b1sqrt(61))/40, whether the cubic f(t) has another root in (0,1).\n\nLet me evaluate f(t) at x=(9 +sqrt(61))/40, which is approximately 0.42.\n\nCompute f(0) when x\u22480.42.\n\nf(0)= (-3/2 x +3/4)= (-1.5*0.42 +0.75)= (-0.63 +0.75)=0.12>0.\n\nf(1)= (-1/2 x)= (-0.5 *0.42)= -0.21<0.\n\nSo, f(0)=0.12, f(1)=-0.21.\n\nSo, since f(t) is positive at t=0 and negative at t=1, and it has a double root at t=k=1 -2x\u22481 -0.84=0.16.\n\nSo, t=k\u22480.16 is a double root. So, the cubic f(t) would have another root, say t=m.\n\nBut let's see where m is.\n\nIf the cubic has a double root at t\u22480.16 and another root, let's see the behavior.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m is greater than1 or less than0, but given that f(0)=0.12>0 and f(1)=-0.21<0, and the double root at t\u22480.16, the function f(t) would cross zero once more in (0,1). So, there would be another root.\n\nThus, point C would lie on another PQ segment, which we don't want.\n\nSo, perhaps the only way to have C not lie on any other PQ is when the cubic f(t) does not cross zero in (0,1). But for x <1/2, f(t) does cross zero.\n\nWait, unless x is such that f(t) doesn't cross zero, which would happen if f(t) doesn't change sign in (0,1). But for x <1/2, f(0) is positive and f(1) is negative, so it must cross zero.\n\nThus, the only way for C not to lie on any other PQ is when x >=1/2, but since on AB, x can't be more than1/2, except at point A. But C is supposed to be distinct from A and B.\n\nWait, perhaps the point C is such that f(t) has a double root at t=k, meaning that the other root is either at t=k or outside (0,1). But in our earlier case, when x=(9 +sqrt(61))/40\u22480.42, which is less than1/2, the cubic f(t) still has another root in (0,1). So, C would lie on another PQ.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nAnother approach: The envelope of the family of lines PQ.\n\nThe envelope is a curve that is tangent to each PQ at some point. So, perhaps the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope.\n\nThe envelope can be found by solving the system:\n\nF(p, q, t) = x = p(1 - t)\n\nG(p, q, t) = y = q t\n\nH(p, q) = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nThe envelope is found by solving the system F=G=H=0, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact method.\n\nAlternatively, the envelope can be found by eliminating parameters p and q.\n\nFrom F and G, we have p = x/(1 - t), q = y/t.\n\nSubstitute into H: (x\u00b2)/(1 - t)^2 + (y\u00b2)/(t^2) =1.\n\nThis is the same equation we had earlier.\n\nTo find the envelope, we can differentiate this equation with respect to t and solve for t.\n\nSo, let's compute d/dt [x\u00b2/(1 - t)^2 + y\u00b2/t\u00b2] =0.\n\nCompute derivative:\n\nd/dt [x\u00b2/(1 - t)^2] = x\u00b2 * 2(1 - t)^(-3) * (1) = 2 x\u00b2/(1 - t)^3.\n\nd/dt [y\u00b2/t\u00b2] = y\u00b2*(-2)/t^3.\n\nSo, 2x\u00b2/(1 - t)^3 - 2 y\u00b2 / t^3 =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2/(1 - t)^3 = y\u00b2/t^3.\n\nTake cube roots:\n\nx/(1 - t) = y/t.\n\nSo, x t = y (1 - t).\n\nx t + y t = y.\n\nt(x + y) = y.\n\nt = y/(x + y).\n\nSo, the envelope is found where t = y/(x + y).\n\nSubstitute back into the original equation:\n\nx\u00b2/(1 - t)^2 + y\u00b2/t\u00b2 =1.\n\nPlug t = y/(x + y):\n\nCompute 1 - t = (x + y - y)/(x + y) =x/(x + y).\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2/(x/(x + y))^2 + y\u00b2/(y/(x + y))^2 =1.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nx\u00b2/(x\u00b2/(x + y)^2) = (x\u00b2)*(x + y)^2 /x\u00b2 = (x + y)^2.\n\nSimilarly, y\u00b2/(y\u00b2/(x + y)^2) = (x + y)^2.\n\nSo, (x + y)^2 + (x + y)^2 =1.\n\nSo, 2(x + y)^2 =1.\n\nThus, (x + y)^2 =1/2.\n\nSo, x + y =1/\u221a2.\n\nBut since we're in the first quadrant, x + y is positive.\n\nThus, the envelope is the line x + y =1/\u221a2.\n\nSo, the envelope of all PQ segments is the line x + y =1/\u221a2.\n\nSo, AB is supposed to be tangent to this envelope at point C.\n\nSo, point C is the point of tangency between AB and the envelope x + y =1/\u221a2.\n\nSo, to find point C, we can find the intersection of AB and the envelope, and ensure that they are tangent, i.e., have only one intersection point.\n\nWait, but AB is a straight line, and the envelope is also a straight line. So, two straight lines can either be parallel or intersect at a single point.\n\nBut in our case, since AB is not parallel to the envelope, they must intersect at exactly one point, which would be the point of tangency.\n\nWait, but if AB is tangent to the envelope, which is another line, then they must coincide? Wait, no, two lines can't be tangent unless they're the same line.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. The envelope is a line, and AB is another line. So, if AB is tangent to the envelope, then AB must coincide with the envelope, which is not the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, the envelope is the set of points where each PQ is tangent to the envelope curve. But in this case, the envelope turned out to be a straight line, which doesn't make sense because each PQ is a segment of a line, and their envelope is another line. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the envelope is not a straight line, but a curve.\n\nWait, no, earlier, when I derived the envelope condition, I found that the envelope is x + y =1/\u221a2. But that seems to be a straight line.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the differentiation step.\n\nWait, let me double-check.\n\nWe have the equation x\u00b2/(1 - t)^2 + y\u00b2/t\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe treated x and y as variables, but in reality, for each PQ, x and y are fixed, and t is a parameter.\n\nWait, no, actually, for the envelope, x and y are variables depending on t, so perhaps I should treat x and y as functions of t.\n\nWait, perhaps the envelope is a curve in the plane, so for each t, we have a point (x(t), y(t)) on the envelope.\n\nWait, let me think differently.\n\nThe envelope is found by solving the system:\n\nF(p, q, t) = x = p(1 - t)\n\nG(p, q, t) = y = q t\n\nH(p, q) = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nEliminating p and q.\n\nFrom F and G:\n\np = x/(1 - t)\n\nq = y/t.\n\nSubstitute into H:\n\n(x/(1 - t))\u00b2 + (y/t)^2 =1.\n\nSo, the envelope is the set of (x, y) such that there exists t where (x/(1 - t))\u00b2 + (y/t)^2 =1.\n\nBut to find the envelope, we also need to take the derivative with respect to t and set it to zero.\n\nWait, I think I did that correctly earlier, leading to x + y =1/\u221a2.\n\nBut if that's the case, then the envelope is the line x + y =1/\u221a2.\n\nBut that seems odd because each PQ is a line segment, and their envelope is another line.\n\nWait, perhaps the envelope is actually the union of all these segments, but that doesn't form a line.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to revisit the envelope concept.\n\nWait, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. In this case, the family is all the PQ segments.\n\nBut each PQ is a straight line segment. So, the envelope of all these segments is the region covered by all these segments.\n\nWait, but the envelope is the boundary of that region.\n\nWait, perhaps the envelope is the astroid formed by the endpoints moving along the axes with the constraint that PQ is of unit length.\n\nWait, I recall that the envelope of such segments is an astroid.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the envelope is an astroid, which is a curve given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = (a)^(2/3), where a is a constant.\n\nWait, let me confirm.\n\nIn general, for a family of lines x/p + y/q =1, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = constant, the envelope is an astroid.\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nSo, in our case, each PQ is a line segment x/p + y/q =1, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nSo, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nWait, let me check.\n\nThe standard astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = a^(2/3).\n\nIn our case, the envelope is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nSo, the astroid is given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nSo, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nSo, AB is a line segment from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). We need to find the point C where AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nSo, point C is the point of tangency between AB and the astroid.\n\nSo, to find C, we can parametrize AB and find where it is tangent to the astroid.\n\nParametrizing AB as earlier: (x, y) = (1/2 (1 - s), sqrt(3)/2 s), where s \u2208 [0,1].\n\nWe need to find s such that the line AB is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1 at point C.\n\nThe condition for tangency is that the line AB is tangent to the astroid at C.\n\nSo, let's write the equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe can find the condition that this line is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nTo find the condition for tangency, we can use the fact that the gradient of the astroid at point C is perpendicular to the direction vector of AB.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the condition that the system of the astroid and AB has exactly one solution.\n\nSo, substitute y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 into x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nSo, x^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) =1.\n\nLet me denote z =x.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nz^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3) z + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) =1.\n\nThis is complicated, but perhaps we can make a substitution.\n\nLet me factor sqrt(3)/2 from the second term:\n\n= z^(2/3) + [ sqrt(3)/2 (-2z +1) ]^(2/3) =1.\n\n= z^(2/3) + (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3) * (-2z +1)^(2/3) =1.\n\nCompute (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3):\n\nsqrt(3)=3^(1/2), so (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3)=3^(1/3)/2^(2/3).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nz^(2/3) + [3^(1/3)/2^(2/3)] * (-2z +1)^(2/3) =1.\n\nLet me denote k=3^(1/3)/2^(2/3).\n\nSo, equation: z^(2/3) +k*(-2z +1)^(2/3)=1.\n\nLet me set u= z^(1/3), v=(-2z +1)^(1/3).\n\nThen, z= u^3, -2z +1= v^3.\n\nSo, from -2z +1= v^3,\n\n-2u^3 +1= v^3.\n\nAlso, the equation becomes u\u00b2 +k v\u00b2=1.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1. u\u00b2 +k v\u00b2 =1.\n\n2. v^3 +2u^3=1.\n\nWe can write equation 2 as v^3=1 -2u^3.\n\nFrom equation 1: v\u00b2=(1 - u\u00b2)/k.\n\nSo, v= sqrt[(1 -u\u00b2)/k].\n\nBut since v is real, (1 -u\u00b2)/k >=0.\n\nSo, 1 -u\u00b2 >=0 \u2192 |u| <=1.\n\nBut since z is in [0,1/2], u= z^(1/3) is in [0, (1/2)^(1/3)] \u2248 [0, 0.7937].\n\nSo, u is positive and less than1.\n\nSo, v= sqrt[(1 -u\u00b2)/k].\n\nBut v^3=1 -2u^3.\n\nSo, [sqrt((1 -u\u00b2)/k)]^3=1 -2u^3.\n\nSimplify:\n\n[(1 -u\u00b2)/k]^(3/2) =1 -2u^3.\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 2/3:\n\n(1 -u\u00b2)/k = [1 -2u^3]^(2/3).\n\nSo,\n\n(1 -u\u00b2) =k [1 -2u^3]^(2/3).\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to find a relationship between u and v.\n\nFrom equation 2: v^3 =1 -2u^3.\n\nFrom equation 1: v\u00b2= (1 -u\u00b2)/k.\n\nLet me write equation 2 as v^3 =1 -2u^3.\n\nExpress v from equation 1: v= sqrt[(1 -u\u00b2)/k].\n\nSo, substitute into equation 2:\n\n[ sqrt((1 -u\u00b2)/k) ]^3 =1 -2u^3.\n\nSimplify:\n\n[(1 -u\u00b2)/k]^(3/2) =1 -2u^3.\n\nThis is a complicated equation, but perhaps we can cube both sides to eliminate the exponents.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to make a substitution.\n\nLet me let w =u^3.\n\nThen, u= w^(1/3).\n\nSo, 1 -u\u00b2=1 -w^(2/3).\n\nSimilarly, 1 -2u^3=1 -2w.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n[(1 -w^(2/3))/k]^(3/2) =1 -2w.\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 2/3:\n\n(1 -w^(2/3))/k = [1 -2w]^(2/3).\n\nHmm, still complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can assume a specific relationship between u and v.\n\nWait, another approach: Since AB is tangent to the astroid at C, the derivative of the astroid at C must equal the slope of AB.\n\nSlope of AB is -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, compute dy/dx of the astroid at point C.\n\nThe astroid equation is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nDifferentiate implicitly:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx =0.\n\nSo,\n\ndy/dx = - [x^(-1/3)] / [y^(-1/3)] = - (y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)).\n\nSo, slope of the astroid at point C is - (y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)).\n\nThis must equal the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\n(y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)) = sqrt(3).\n\nRaise both sides to the power of3:\n\n(y)/(x)= (sqrt(3))^3= 3*sqrt(3).\n\nSo, y=3 sqrt(3) x.\n\nBut point C lies on AB, which has equation y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, set 3 sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n3 sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nFactor sqrt(3) x:\n\nsqrt(3) x (3 +1) = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(3) x *4 = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n4x =1/2 \u2192 x=1/8.\n\nSo, x=1/8.\n\nThen, y=3 sqrt(3) * (1/8)= 3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nWait, but let's check if this point lies on AB.\n\nAB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAt x=1/8,\n\ny= -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2= (-sqrt(3)/8 +4 sqrt(3)/8)=3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nYes, so point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nSo, OC\u00b2 is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 =1/64 + (27)/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nSo, OC\u00b2=7/16. So, p=7, q=16, p+q=23.\n\nWait, but let me verify.\n\nWait, in our earlier steps, we set the slope of the astroid at C equal to the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).\n\nFrom the astroid, dy/dx= - (y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)).\n\nSet equal to -sqrt(3):\n\n(y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3))=sqrt(3).\n\nSo, y= (sqrt(3))^3 x= 3 sqrt(3) x.\n\nSo, y=3 sqrt(3) x.\n\nBut point C is on AB, which is y= -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, solving 3 sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nBring terms together:\n\n3 sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) x= sqrt(3)/2.\n\n4 sqrt(3) x= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n4x=1/2 \u2192 x=1/8.\n\nThen, y=3 sqrt(3)*(1/8)=3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo, C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nCompute OC\u00b2= (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 =1/64 + (27)/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nYes, so OC\u00b2=7/16.\n\nThus, p=7, q=16, which are coprime.\n\nSo, p+q=23.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first identify the family of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. The line AB connects A(1/2, 0) and B(0, \u221a3/2) and has a length of 1, making it a member of the family F. We need to find a unique point C on AB that does not lie on any other segment from F except AB.\n\nThe equation of line AB is derived as y = -\u221a3x + \u221a3/2. The envelope of the family F forms an astroid given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1. For point C to be the unique point where AB is tangent to this astroid, we set the slope of AB equal to the derivative of the astroid at C.\n\nThe slope of AB is -\u221a3. The derivative of the astroid at any point (x, y) is dy/dx = -(y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)). Setting this equal to -\u221a3, we find y = 3\u221a3 x. Solving this with the equation of AB, we find the coordinates of C as (1/8, 3\u221a3/8). Calculating OC\u00b2 gives us (1/8)\u00b2 + (3\u221a3/8)\u00b2 = 7/16. Thus, p = 7 and q = 16, leading to p + q = 23.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{23}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it out step by step. \n\nWe have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is somewhere on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. I should probably sketch this out to visualize.\n\nPoints O, A, and B form a triangle, right? Because O is connected to A, which is on the x-axis, and O is connected to B on the y-axis. Then A is connected to B, forming the line segment AB. So, the triangle is OAB.\n\nNext, the family F consists of segments PQ of unit length. These segments are in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment from some point P on the x-axis to some point Q on the y-axis, and the length of PQ is 1. \n\nSince all these segments have length 1 and are in the first quadrant, their endpoints are on the positive x and y axes. So, for any such segment PQ, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), where p and q are positive real numbers. The length of PQ is sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1. So, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nTherefore, all such segments PQ lie on the unit circle in the first quadrant, connecting (p,0) to (0,q) where p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nNow, the problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is one of these segments in F because A is (1/2,0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the length of AB.\n\nDistance between A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2): sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So, yes, AB is a segment in F with length 1.\n\nSo, the family F includes all such segments PQ, each of which is a unit length from x-axis to y-axis in the first quadrant. Now, point C is on AB, not A or B, and it doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, C is unique in that sense.\n\nWe need to find OC\u00b2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express this as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.\n\nSo, first, I need to find the coordinates of point C on AB, such that C doesn't lie on any other segment PQ in F except AB.\n\nHmm, how to approach this. Maybe parametrize AB and find the point C such that it doesn't lie on any other PQ from F.\n\nLet me parametrize AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the line AB can be parametrized as:\n\nx = 1/2 - (1/2)t\n\ny = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2) t\n\nwhere t ranges from 0 to 1. So, when t=0, we're at A, and t=1, we're at B.\n\nSo, any point C on AB can be written as (1/2 - t/2, (sqrt(3)/2) t) for some t between 0 and 1.\n\nNow, we need to find C such that it's not on any other PQ in F except AB. So, if another segment PQ from F passes through C, then that would be a problem because C is supposed to be unique to AB.\n\nSo, our task is to find the point C on AB where no other PQ in F passes through it. So, in other words, the point C is the only point on AB that is on AB and not on any other PQ in F.\n\nAlternatively, the point C is the point where the envelope of the family F is tangent to AB. Because the envelope is the set of points that are touched by exactly one member of the family F, so the point C would be where the envelope touches AB.\n\nWait, that sounds plausible. So, the envelope of the family F is the curve that is tangent to each PQ in F. So, if we find the envelope, and then find the point where the envelope is tangent to AB, that point C is the one we need.\n\nSo, let's try to find the envelope of the family F.\n\nEach segment PQ is from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, the equation of the line PQ can be written as:\n\nx/p + y/q = 1.\n\nSince p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, we can write q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2), but perhaps it's better to parameterize in terms of a single variable.\n\nLet me parameterize the family F with a parameter, say, p. So, for each p in (0,1), we have a segment PQ from (p,0) to (0, q), where q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2). So, the equation of the line PQ is x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)) = 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a different parameter, like theta, but I think p is okay.\n\nNow, to find the envelope of these lines, we can use the method of solving for the envelope where both the equation and its derivative with respect to the parameter are zero.\n\nWait, but the envelope is found by considering the family of curves and solving f(p, x, y) = 0 and df/dp = 0.\n\nSo, let's denote f(p, x, y) = x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)) - 1 = 0.\n\nThen, the envelope satisfies f(p, x, y) = 0 and \u2202f/\u2202p = 0.\n\nSo, compute \u2202f/\u2202p:\n\ndf/dp = -x / p\u00b2 + y * ( (1/2)(1 - p\u00b2)^(-3/2) * 2p ) \n\n= -x / p\u00b2 + y * ( p / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) )\n\nSo, set \u2202f/\u2202p = 0:\n\n-x / p\u00b2 + y * p / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) = 0.\n\nSo, rearranged:\n\ny * p / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) = x / p\u00b2.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\ny = x * ( (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) ) / p^3.\n\nBut from the original equation f(p, x, y) = 0:\n\nx/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)) = 1.\n\nWe can solve for y:\n\ny = (1 - x/p) * sqrt(1 - p\u00b2).\n\nSo, now we have two expressions for y:\n\n1. y = (1 - x/p) * sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)\n2. y = x * ( (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) ) / p^3.\n\nSo, set them equal:\n\n(1 - x/p) * sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = x * (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) / p^3.\n\nLet me simplify this.\n\nFirst, notice that sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) is (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2), and (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) is (1 - p\u00b2) * sqrt(1 - p\u00b2).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(1 - x/p) * (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2) = x * (1 - p\u00b2) * (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2) / p^3.\n\nWait, actually, let me compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: (1 - x/p) * (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2)\n\nRight side: x * (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) / p^3.\n\nLet me factor out (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2) from both sides:\n\nLeft side: (1 - x/p) * (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2)\n\nRight side: x * (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2) * (1 - p\u00b2) / p^3\n\nSo, we can divide both sides by (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2), assuming it's non-zero, which it is since p is in (0,1).\n\nSo, we get:\n\n1 - x/p = x * (1 - p\u00b2) / p^3.\n\nMultiply both sides by p^3 to eliminate denominators:\n\np^3 (1 - x/p) = x (1 - p\u00b2)\n\nSimplify left side:\n\np^3 - x p^2 = x (1 - p\u00b2)\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\np^3 - x p^2 - x + x p\u00b2 = 0\n\nWait, let's expand the right side:\n\nx (1 - p\u00b2) = x - x p\u00b2.\n\nSo, bringing everything to the left:\n\np^3 - x p^2 - x + x p\u00b2 = p^3 - x = 0.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLeft side after expansion: p^3 - x p^2\n\nMinus right side: - x + x p\u00b2\n\nSo, p^3 - x p^2 - x + x p\u00b2 = p^3 - x.\n\nSo, p^3 - x = 0 => x = p^3.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, x = p^3.\n\nBut we also have from the original equation f(p, x, y)=0:\n\nx/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)) = 1.\n\nSubstituting x = p^3 into this:\n\np^3 / p + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 1 => p\u00b2 + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 1.\n\nSo, solve for y:\n\ny / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 1 - p\u00b2.\n\nSo, y = (1 - p\u00b2) * sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2).\n\nSo, now, we have x = p^3 and y = (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2).\n\nSo, the envelope is parametrized by p as (p^3, (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)).\n\nBut I need to find the envelope in terms of x and y, so let's try to eliminate p.\n\nWe have x = p^3, so p = x^(1/3).\n\nThen, y = (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) = (1 - (x^(2/3)))^(3/2).\n\nSo, y = [1 - x^(2/3)]^(3/2).\n\nAlternatively, raising both sides to the power of 2/3:\n\ny^(2/3) = 1 - x^(2/3)\n\nSo, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nThat's the equation of the envelope: x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nOh, that's the astroid curve.\n\nSo, the envelope of the family F is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nNow, the point C is the point where the astroid is tangent to AB.\n\nBecause C is on AB and on the envelope (so it's the point where AB is tangent to the astroid). Because if AB is a member of the family F, then the envelope would be tangent to it at exactly one point, which is C.\n\nSo, to find C, we need to find the point of tangency between AB and the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nSo, let me find the equation of AB and then find the point where AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nFirst, find the equation of AB.\n\nPoints A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + c. To find c, plug in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nNow, to find the point C where this line is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nTo find the point of tangency, we can use the condition that the line AB is tangent to the astroid. So, we can solve the system:\n\ny = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nand x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nAdditionally, the derivative of the astroid at point C should be equal to the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, let's compute the derivative of the astroid.\n\nGiven x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to x:\n\n(2/3) x^(-1/3) + (2/3) y^(-1/3) dy/dx = 0.\n\nSo,\n\ndy/dx = - [ (2/3) x^(-1/3) ] / [ (2/3) y^(-1/3) ) ] = - (x^(-1/3) ) / (y^(-1/3)) ) = - ( y^(1/3) ) / (x^(1/3) ).\n\nSo, dy/dx = - (y/x)^(1/3).\n\nBut at point C, this derivative should equal the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\n- (y/x)^(1/3) = -sqrt(3) => (y/x)^(1/3) = sqrt(3).\n\nCubing both sides:\n\ny/x = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3 * sqrt(3).\n\nSo, y = 3 sqrt(3) x.\n\nBut we also have the equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, set y = 3 sqrt(3) x equal to y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nThus,\n\n3 sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nBring the -sqrt(3) x to the left:\n\n3 sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n4 sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n4 x = 1/2 => x = 1/8.\n\nThen, y = 3 sqrt(3) * (1/8) = 3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nWait, but let me check if this point lies on AB.\n\nFrom AB's equation, y should be -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, plug x=1/8:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nNow, we need to compute OC\u00b2, which is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(1/8)^2 = 1/64.\n\n(3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 9 * 3 / 64 = 27/64.\n\nSo, OC\u00b2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 28 divided by 64 is 7/16. Hmm, but wait, 7 and 16 are coprime, so p=7 and q=16, so p+q=23.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8). So, OC is the distance from the origin, so squared is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nSo, 1/64 + (9 * 3)/64 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I thought the astroid is the envelope, and the point C is where AB is tangent to the astroid. So, is that the only point where AB meets the astroid? Or could there be another intersection?\n\nWait, let me check if (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8) is the only point where AB and the astroid meet.\n\nLet me plug in x=1/8 into the astroid equation:\n\nx^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = (1/8)^(2/3) + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/8)^(2/3) = (1/8)^(2/3) = (1^(2/3))/(8^(2/3)) = 1/(4) = 1/4.\n\nSimilarly, (3 sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3):\n\nFirst, note that 3 sqrt(3) = 3^(3/2), so 3 sqrt(3)/8 = 3^(3/2)/8.\n\nSo, (3^(3/2)/8)^(2/3) = (3^(3/2))^(2/3) / (8)^(2/3) = 3^(1) / 4 = 3/4.\n\nSo, adding them together: 1/4 + 3/4 = 1, which satisfies the astroid equation.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, to confirm that this is the only point of intersection between AB and the astroid, we can set up the equations and see if there are other solutions.\n\nWe have AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nPlug into astroid: x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nSo,\n\nx^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) = 1.\n\nThis is a complicated equation, but we know that x=1/8 is a solution. Let me see if there's another solution.\n\nLet me denote t = x.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\nt^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) = 1.\n\nLet me factor sqrt(3)/2:\n\n[ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ] = sqrt(3) [ -t + 1/2 ].\n\nSo,\n\n[ sqrt(3)( -t + 1/2 ) ]^(2/3) = [ sqrt(3) ]^(2/3) * [ -t + 1/2 ]^(2/3) = (3)^(1/3) * [ (1/2 - t) ]^(2/3).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nt^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) * (1/2 - t)^(2/3) = 1.\n\nLet me denote u = t^(1/3), so t = u^3.\n\nSimilarly, 1/2 - t = 1/2 - u^3.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\nu^2 + 3^(1/3) * (1/2 - u^3)^(2/3) = 1.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can see if t=1/8 is the only solution.\n\nSince we found that when t=1/8, the equation holds, and given the nature of the astroid and the line AB, it's plausible that this is the only point of intersection.\n\nThus, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8), and OC\u00b2 is 7/16.\n\nTherefore, p=7, q=16, so p+q=23.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it out step by step. \n\nWe have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is somewhere on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. I should probably sketch this out to visualize.\n\nPoints O, A, and B form a triangle, right? Because O is connected to A, which is on the x-axis, and O is connected to B on the y-axis. Then A is connected to B, forming the line segment AB. So, the triangle is OAB.\n\nNext, the family F consists of segments PQ of unit length. These segments are in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment from some point P on the x-axis to some point Q on the y-axis, and the length of PQ is 1. \n\nSince all these segments have length 1 and are in the first quadrant, their endpoints are on the positive x and y axes. So, for any such segment PQ, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), where p and q are positive real numbers. The length of PQ is sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1. So, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nTherefore, all such segments PQ lie on the unit circle in the first quadrant, connecting (p,0) to (0,q) where p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nNow, the problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is one of these segments in F because A is (1/2,0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the length of AB.\n\nDistance between A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2): sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So, yes, AB is a segment in F with length 1.\n\nSo, the family F includes all such segments PQ, each of which is a unit length from x-axis to y-axis in the first quadrant. Now, point C is on AB, not A or B, and it doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, C is unique in that sense.\n\nWe need to find OC\u00b2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express this as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.\n\nSo, first, I need to find the coordinates of point C on AB, such that C doesn't lie on any other segment PQ in F except AB.\n\nHmm, how to approach this. Maybe parametrize AB and find the point C such that it doesn't lie on any other PQ from F.\n\nLet me parametrize AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the line AB can be parametrized as:\n\nx = 1/2 - (1/2)t\n\ny = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2) t\n\nwhere t ranges from 0 to 1. So, when t=0, we're at A, and t=1, we're at B.\n\nSo, any point C on AB can be written as (1/2 - t/2, (sqrt(3)/2) t) for some t between 0 and 1.\n\nNow, we need to find C such that it's not on any other PQ in F except AB. So, if another segment PQ from F passes through C, then that would be a problem because C is supposed to be unique to AB.\n\nSo, our task is to find the point C on AB where no other PQ in F passes through it. So, in other words, the point C is the only point on AB that is on AB and not on any other PQ in F.\n\nAlternatively, the point C is the point where the envelope of the family F is tangent to AB. Because the envelope is the set of points that are touched by exactly one member of the family F, so the point C would be where the envelope touches AB.\n\nWait, that sounds plausible. So, the envelope of the family F is the curve that is tangent to each PQ in F. So, if we find the envelope, and then find the point where the envelope is tangent to AB, that point C is the one we need.\n\nSo, let's try to find the envelope of the family F.\n\nEach segment PQ is from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, the equation of the line PQ can be written as:\n\nx/p + y/q = 1.\n\nSince p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, we can write q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2), but perhaps it's better to parameterize in terms of a single variable.\n\nLet me parameterize the family F with a parameter, say, p. So, for each p in (0,1), we have a segment PQ from (p,0) to (0, q), where q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2). So, the equation of the line PQ is x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)) = 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a different parameter, like theta, but I think p is okay.\n\nNow, to find the envelope of these lines, we can use the method of solving for the envelope where both the equation and its derivative with respect to the parameter are zero.\n\nWait, but the envelope is found by considering the family of curves and solving f(p, x, y) = 0 and df/dp = 0.\n\nSo, let's denote f(p, x, y) = x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)) - 1 = 0.\n\nThen, the envelope satisfies f(p, x, y) = 0 and \u2202f/\u2202p = 0.\n\nSo, compute \u2202f/\u2202p:\n\ndf/dp = -x / p\u00b2 + y * ( (1/2)(1 - p\u00b2)^(-3/2) * 2p ) \n\n= -x / p\u00b2 + y * ( p / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) )\n\nSo, set \u2202f/\u2202p = 0:\n\n-x / p\u00b2 + y * p / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) = 0.\n\nSo, rearranged:\n\ny * p / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) = x / p\u00b2.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\ny = x * ( (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) ) / p^3.\n\nBut from the original equation f(p, x, y) = 0:\n\nx/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)) = 1.\n\nWe can solve for y:\n\ny = (1 - x/p) * sqrt(1 - p\u00b2).\n\nSo, now we have two expressions for y:\n\n1. y = (1 - x/p) * sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)\n2. y = x * ( (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) ) / p^3.\n\nSo, set them equal:\n\n(1 - x/p) * sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = x * (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) / p^3.\n\nLet me simplify this.\n\nFirst, notice that sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) is (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2), and (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) is (1 - p\u00b2) * sqrt(1 - p\u00b2).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(1 - x/p) * (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2) = x * (1 - p\u00b2) * (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2) / p^3.\n\nWait, actually, let me compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: (1 - x/p) * (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2)\n\nRight side: x * (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) / p^3.\n\nLet me factor out (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2) from both sides:\n\nLeft side: (1 - x/p) * (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2)\n\nRight side: x * (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2) * (1 - p\u00b2) / p^3\n\nSo, we can divide both sides by (1 - p\u00b2)^(1/2), assuming it's non-zero, which it is since p is in (0,1).\n\nSo, we get:\n\n1 - x/p = x * (1 - p\u00b2) / p^3.\n\nMultiply both sides by p^3 to eliminate denominators:\n\np^3 (1 - x/p) = x (1 - p\u00b2)\n\nSimplify left side:\n\np^3 - x p^2 = x (1 - p\u00b2)\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\np^3 - x p^2 - x + x p\u00b2 = 0\n\nWait, let's expand the right side:\n\nx (1 - p\u00b2) = x - x p\u00b2.\n\nSo, bringing everything to the left:\n\np^3 - x p^2 - x + x p\u00b2 = p^3 - x = 0.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLeft side after expansion: p^3 - x p^2\n\nMinus right side: - x + x p\u00b2\n\nSo, p^3 - x p^2 - x + x p\u00b2 = p^3 - x.\n\nSo, p^3 - x = 0 => x = p^3.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, x = p^3.\n\nBut we also have from the original equation f(p, x, y)=0:\n\nx/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)) = 1.\n\nSubstituting x = p^3 into this:\n\np^3 / p + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 1 => p\u00b2 + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 1.\n\nSo, solve for y:\n\ny / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = 1 - p\u00b2.\n\nSo, y = (1 - p\u00b2) * sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) = (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2).\n\nSo, now, we have x = p^3 and y = (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2).\n\nSo, the envelope is parametrized by p as (p^3, (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)).\n\nBut I need to find the envelope in terms of x and y, so let's try to eliminate p.\n\nWe have x = p^3, so p = x^(1/3).\n\nThen, y = (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) = (1 - (x^(2/3)))^(3/2).\n\nSo, y = [1 - x^(2/3)]^(3/2).\n\nAlternatively, raising both sides to the power of 2/3:\n\ny^(2/3) = 1 - x^(2/3)\n\nSo, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nThat's the equation of the envelope: x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nOh, that's the astroid curve.\n\nSo, the envelope of the family F is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nNow, the point C is the point where the astroid is tangent to AB.\n\nBecause C is on AB and on the envelope (so it's the point where AB is tangent to the astroid). Because if AB is a member of the family F, then the envelope would be tangent to it at exactly one point, which is C.\n\nSo, to find C, we need to find the point of tangency between AB and the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nSo, let me find the equation of AB and then find the point where AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nFirst, find the equation of AB.\n\nPoints A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + c. To find c, plug in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nNow, to find the point C where this line is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nTo find the point of tangency, we can use the condition that the line AB is tangent to the astroid. So, we can solve the system:\n\ny = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nand x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nAdditionally, the derivative of the astroid at point C should be equal to the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, let's compute the derivative of the astroid.\n\nGiven x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to x:\n\n(2/3) x^(-1/3) + (2/3) y^(-1/3) dy/dx = 0.\n\nSo,\n\ndy/dx = - [ (2/3) x^(-1/3) ] / [ (2/3) y^(-1/3) ) ] = - (x^(-1/3) ) / (y^(-1/3)) ) = - ( y^(1/3) ) / (x^(1/3) ).\n\nSo, dy/dx = - (y/x)^(1/3).\n\nBut at point C, this derivative should equal the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\n- (y/x)^(1/3) = -sqrt(3) => (y/x)^(1/3) = sqrt(3).\n\nCubing both sides:\n\ny/x = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3 * sqrt(3).\n\nSo, y = 3 sqrt(3) x.\n\nBut we also have the equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, set y = 3 sqrt(3) x equal to y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nThus,\n\n3 sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nBring the -sqrt(3) x to the left:\n\n3 sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n4 sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n4 x = 1/2 => x = 1/8.\n\nThen, y = 3 sqrt(3) * (1/8) = 3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nWait, but let me check if this point lies on AB.\n\nFrom AB's equation, y should be -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, plug x=1/8:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nNow, we need to compute OC\u00b2, which is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(1/8)^2 = 1/64.\n\n(3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 9 * 3 / 64 = 27/64.\n\nSo, OC\u00b2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 28 divided by 64 is 7/16. Hmm, but wait, 7 and 16 are coprime, so p=7 and q=16, so p+q=23.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8). So, OC is the distance from the origin, so squared is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nSo, 1/64 + (9 * 3)/64 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I thought the astroid is the envelope, and the point C is where AB is tangent to the astroid. So, is that the only point where AB meets the astroid? Or could there be another intersection?\n\nWait, let me check if (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8) is the only point where AB and the astroid meet.\n\nLet me plug in x=1/8 into the astroid equation:\n\nx^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = (1/8)^(2/3) + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/8)^(2/3) = (1/8)^(2/3) = (1^(2/3))/(8^(2/3)) = 1/(4) = 1/4.\n\nSimilarly, (3 sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3):\n\nFirst, note that 3 sqrt(3) = 3^(3/2), so 3 sqrt(3)/8 = 3^(3/2)/8.\n\nSo, (3^(3/2)/8)^(2/3) = (3^(3/2))^(2/3) / (8)^(2/3) = 3^(1) / 4 = 3/4.\n\nSo, adding them together: 1/4 + 3/4 = 1, which satisfies the astroid equation.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, to confirm that this is the only point of intersection between AB and the astroid, we can set up the equations and see if there are other solutions.\n\nWe have AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nPlug into astroid: x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.\n\nSo,\n\nx^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) = 1.\n\nThis is a complicated equation, but we know that x=1/8 is a solution. Let me see if there's another solution.\n\nLet me denote t = x.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\nt^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) = 1.\n\nLet me factor sqrt(3)/2:\n\n[ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ] = sqrt(3) [ -t + 1/2 ].\n\nSo,\n\n[ sqrt(3)( -t + 1/2 ) ]^(2/3) = [ sqrt(3) ]^(2/3) * [ -t + 1/2 ]^(2/3) = (3)^(1/3) * [ (1/2 - t) ]^(2/3).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nt^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) * (1/2 - t)^(2/3) = 1.\n\nLet me denote u = t^(1/3), so t = u^3.\n\nSimilarly, 1/2 - t = 1/2 - u^3.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\nu^2 + 3^(1/3) * (1/2 - u^3)^(2/3) = 1.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can see if t=1/8 is the only solution.\n\nSince we found that when t=1/8, the equation holds, and given the nature of the astroid and the line AB, it's plausible that this is the only point of intersection.\n\nThus, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8), and OC\u00b2 is 7/16.\n\nTherefore, p=7, q=16, so p+q=23.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first note that points \\( O(0,0) \\), \\( A\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right) \\), and \\( B\\left(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\) form a triangle in the coordinate plane.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.\n\nWe have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These points form a line segment AB. Then, there's a family F of segments PQ, each of unit length, lying in the first quadrant. Each P is on the x-axis, and each Q is on the y-axis.\n\nSo, PQ is a segment from the x-axis to the y-axis, length 1, in the first quadrant. So, for each such PQ, P is (p,0) and Q is (0,q), with sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, because the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So each PQ is a line segment of length 1, moving along the axes.\n\nThen, the problem says that there is a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F except AB. So, AB is part of the family F, right? Because when you take P as A and Q as B, then PQ is AB, which should be of length 1? Wait, let's check: the distance from A to B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So yes, AB is indeed a segment in F. So, point C is on AB, but not equal to A or B, and it doesn't lie on any other segment from F. So, for all other PQ in F, C is not on PQ. We need to find OC\u00b2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express it as p/q, reduced fraction, and find p+q.\n\nAlright, so the key is to find point C on AB such that it's not on any other segment from F except AB.\n\nFirst, let's parametrize AB. Points O, A, B are given. Let's find the equation of line AB.\n\nPoint A is (1/2, 0) and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)*(0) + 0? Wait, wait, let's do it correctly.\n\nWait, the line passes through A (1/2, 0) and B (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, using point-slope form: y - 0 = m(x - 1/2), where m is the slope. The slope is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, equation is y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplify: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nNow, any point C on AB can be parametrized as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) for x between 0 and 1/2.\n\nWe need to find C such that it's not on any other PQ in F except AB.\n\nSo, for any other segment PQ in F, C shouldn't lie on PQ. So, for all PQ in F except AB, the point C is not on PQ.\n\nSo, let's consider what these PQ segments look like. Each PQ connects a point (p,0) on the x-axis to (0,q) on the y-axis, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, the equation of PQ is (x/p) + (y/q) = 1, since it's a line connecting (p,0) and (0,q).\n\nNow, for each PQ in F, the line PQ is x/p + y/q = 1, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe need to find a point C on AB such that for all other PQ (i.e., PQ not equal to AB), C is not on PQ.\n\nSo, the point C is the intersection point of AB with all possible PQs, but only lies on AB and no other PQ.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit vague. Maybe another approach is to consider the envelope of the family F of lines PQ.\n\nWait, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. In this case, perhaps the envelope of the family F is the curve that touches each PQ at exactly one point, and C is the point where AB is tangent to this envelope.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the point C is such that the line AB is tangent to the envelope of F, meaning that C is the point of tangency.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose we have a point C on AB. We need to ensure that for any other PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, for any p, q with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, and PQ being the line x/p + y/q = 1, C is not on PQ unless PQ is AB.\n\nSo, we can set up the condition that for C = (x, y) on AB, the equation x/p + y/q = 1 has no solution except when PQ is AB.\n\nWait, but AB is a specific PQ with p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2, since AB connects (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, for any other p and q, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, the line x/p + y/q =1 should not pass through C.\n\nSo, for point C = (x, y) on AB, we need that for all p, q with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, and (p, q) \u2260 (1/2, sqrt(3)/2), the equation x/p + y/q \u22601.\n\nAlternatively, we can rephrase this: For all p, q with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, except p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2, the equation x/p + y/q \u22601.\n\nWait, but that's a bit abstract. Maybe we can think of it as the point C is not on any other PQ, so for all other PQ, substituting C into the equation gives a false statement.\n\nAlternatively, the point C is the only intersection point between AB and F, meaning that AB is tangent to the envelope of F at C.\n\nHmm, that makes sense. Because if AB is tangent to the envelope, then it touches the envelope at exactly one point, which is C, and doesn't intersect any other PQ in F.\n\nSo, perhaps the envelope of the family F is a curve, and AB is tangent to this curve at point C.\n\nSo, to find the envelope, we can use calculus. The envelope of a family of curves given by F(x, y, p) = 0 is found by solving the system:\n\nF(x, y, p) = 0,\n\ndF/dp = 0.\n\nHere, each PQ can be represented as F(x, y, p) = x/p + y/q -1 =0, but since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, we can express q in terms of p: q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2). But since we are in the first quadrant, q is positive, so q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2).\n\nSo, substituting q, we get F(x, y, p) = x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) -1 =0.\n\nTo find the envelope, we need to solve F(x, y, p)=0 and dF/dp =0.\n\nCompute dF/dp:\n\ndF/dp = -x/p\u00b2 + y*( (1/2)(1 - p\u00b2)^(-3/2) * 2p ) = -x/p\u00b2 + (y p)/ (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2).\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\n-x/p\u00b2 + (y p)/(1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) =0.\n\nSo,\n\n(y p)/(1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) = x/p\u00b2.\n\nMultiply both sides by p\u00b2(1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2):\n\ny p^3 = x (1 - p\u00b2)^2.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) =1,\n\n2) y p^3 = x (1 - p\u00b2)^2.\n\nWe can solve these two equations for x and y in terms of p.\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\nx = (y p^3)/( (1 - p\u00b2)^2 ).\n\nSubstitute x into equation 1:\n\n( (y p^3)/( (1 - p\u00b2)^2 ) ) / p + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n( y p\u00b2 ) / (1 - p\u00b2)^2 + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) =1.\n\nFactor out y:\n\ny [ p\u00b2 / (1 - p\u00b2)^2 + 1 / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ] =1.\n\nLet me compute the expression in brackets:\n\nLet me write (1 - p\u00b2) as t for simplicity. Let t =1 - p\u00b2, so p\u00b2 =1 -t.\n\nThen, the expression becomes:\n\n( (1 - t) ) / t\u00b2 + 1 / sqrt(t).\n\nSo, [ (1 - t)/t\u00b2 + 1/sqrt(t) ].\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let's write everything with denominator t\u00b2.\n\nSo, [ (1 - t) + t^(3/2) ] / t\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, because 1/sqrt(t) is t^(-1/2), which is t^(-1/2). So, to have a common denominator, maybe it's better to compute numerically.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of substitution, let's factor the original expression.\n\nWait, [ p\u00b2 / (1 - p\u00b2)^2 + 1 / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ] = [ p\u00b2 + (1 - p\u00b2)^{3/2} ] / (1 - p\u00b2)^2.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the first term is p\u00b2/(1-p\u00b2)^2, and the second term is 1/sqrt(1-p\u00b2). To add these, we need a common denominator. The first term's denominator is (1-p\u00b2)^2, the second term's denominator is (1-p\u00b2)^{1/2}.\n\nSo, we can write the second term as (1-p\u00b2)^{3/2} / (1-p\u00b2)^2.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n[ p\u00b2 + (1-p\u00b2)^{3/2} ] / (1 - p\u00b2)^2.\n\nSo, putting it back into the equation:\n\ny [ p\u00b2 + (1-p\u00b2)^{3/2} ] / (1 - p\u00b2)^2 =1.\n\nSo, solving for y:\n\ny = (1 - p\u00b2)^2 / [ p\u00b2 + (1 - p\u00b2)^{3/2} ].\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe we can find a substitution or parameterization that makes this easier.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the envelope is a curve, and we can parametrize it in terms of p.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the envelope in terms of an angle. Let me think.\n\nSince each PQ has p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, we can parametrize p = cos\u03b8, q = sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2, because we are in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, let's let p = cos\u03b8, q = sin\u03b8. Then, the equation of PQ is x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nThen, the derivative with respect to \u03b8 is:\n\ndF/d\u03b8 = -x sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo,\n\n- x sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8 to eliminate denominators:\n\n- x sin\u00b3\u03b8 + y cos\u00b3\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo,\n\ny cos\u00b3\u03b8 = x sin\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\ny = x (sin\u00b3\u03b8 / cos\u00b3\u03b8) = x tan\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nSo, from this, we have y = x tan\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nNow, substitute this back into the original equation of PQ:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSubstitute y:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + (x tan\u00b3\u03b8)/ sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + x (sin\u00b3\u03b8 / cos\u00b3\u03b8) / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\nx (sin\u00b3\u03b8) / (cos\u00b3\u03b8 sin\u03b8) )= x sin\u00b2\u03b8 / cos\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + x sin\u00b2\u03b8 / cos\u00b3\u03b8 =1.\n\nFactor x:\n\nx [ 1/cos\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 / cos\u00b3\u03b8 ] =1.\n\nCompute the term in brackets:\n\n1/cos\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 / cos\u00b3\u03b8 = (cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8)/cos\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nSince cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1,\n\n= 1 / cos\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nx / cos\u00b3\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo, x = cos\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nThen, since y =x tan\u00b3\u03b8,\n\ny = cos\u00b3\u03b8 * (sin\u00b3\u03b8 / cos\u00b3\u03b8) = sin\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nSo, the parametric equations for the envelope are:\n\nx = cos\u00b3\u03b8,\n\ny = sin\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nSo, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nWait, because (cos\u00b3\u03b8)^(2/3) + (sin\u00b3\u03b8)^(2/3) = cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo, yes, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nSo, the envelope of the family F is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nNow, the line AB is supposed to be tangent to this astroid at point C.\n\nSo, we need to find the point C where line AB is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nOnce we find C, then OC\u00b2 is just x\u00b2 + y\u00b2.\n\nSo, how do we find the point of tangency between line AB and the astroid?\n\nWe can use the condition that the line AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nThe equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe can substitute this into the astroid equation and set the discriminant to zero to find the point of tangency.\n\nSo, substituting y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nx^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) =1.\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Maybe instead of substituting, we can use calculus.\n\nAlternatively, the condition for tangency is that the line AB touches the astroid at exactly one point, so their intersection has multiplicity one, but since it's a point of tangency, the system has a double root.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to find the derivative of the astroid and set it equal to the slope of AB.\n\nThe astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nImplicit differentiation:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx =0.\n\nSo,\n\ndy/dx = - [x^(-1/3) ] / [y^(-1/3)] = - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)).\n\nSo, the slope of the astroid at any point (x,y) is - (y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)).\n\nThe slope of AB is -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, at the point of tangency C, the slope of the astroid must equal the slope of AB.\n\nSo,\n\n- (y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3).\n\nSimplify:\n\n(y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)) = sqrt(3).\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3:\n\ny / x = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3*sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\ny = 3*sqrt(3) x.\n\nBut we also know that point C lies on AB, whose equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting y = 3*sqrt(3) x into AB's equation:\n\n3*sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n3*sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) x - sqrt(3)/2 =0.\n\nFactor sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(3)(4x -1/2) =0.\n\nSince sqrt(3) \u22600,\n\n4x -1/2=0 => x= (1/2)/4 =1/8.\n\nSo, x=1/8.\n\nThen, y=3*sqrt(3)*(1/8)= 3*sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo, point C is (1/8, 3*sqrt(3)/8).\n\nNow, let's check if this point is indeed on the astroid:\n\nx^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = (1/8)^(2/3) + (3*sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/8)^(2/3) = (1^(2/3))/(8^(2/3)) =1/(4) =1/4.\n\n(3*sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3) = [ (3^(3/2)) /8 ]^(2/3) = (3^(3/2))^(2/3) /8^(2/3) )= 3^( (3/2)*(2/3) ) /4= 3^1 /4 =3/4.\n\nSo, 1/4 + 3/4 =1. Perfect, it lies on the astroid.\n\nSo, point C is (1/8, 3*sqrt(3)/8).\n\nNow, compute OC\u00b2:\n\nOC\u00b2 = (1/8)^2 + (3*sqrt(3)/8)^2 =1/64 + (27)/64 = (1 +27)/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 3*sqrt(3) squared is 9*3=27, yes. So 27/64.\n\n1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16. So, OC\u00b2=7/16.\n\nWait, but 7 and 16 are coprime, so p=7, q=16, p+q=23.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Let me verify that point C is indeed on AB and on the astroid.\n\nWait, AB is from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is approximately (0.5,0) to (0, 0.866).\n\nPoint C is at (1/8, 3*sqrt(3)/8), which is (0.125, approx 0.6495). That lies between O and AB, so it's on AB.\n\nAnd it's on the astroid, as we saw. So, seems correct.\n\nSo, OC\u00b2=7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let's think again about the problem.\n\nThe problem states that C is on AB, and it's the unique point on AB that isn't on any other segment from F except AB. So, the envelope is the astroid, and AB is tangent to the astroid at C, which is the only point of intersection. So, any other PQ in F would intersect AB at some other point, but C is the only point where AB meets the envelope, hence the only point on AB that's on any PQ from F is C, which is on AB itself.\n\nThus, the answer is 7/16, so p+q=23.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we first identify the family of segments $\\overline{PQ}$ of unit length in the first quadrant, where $P$ is on the $x$-axis and $Q$ is on the $y$-axis.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.\n\nWe have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These points form a line segment AB. Then, there's a family F of segments PQ, each of unit length, lying in the first quadrant. Each P is on the x-axis, and each Q is on the y-axis.\n\nSo, PQ is a segment from the x-axis to the y-axis, length 1, in the first quadrant. So, for each such PQ, P is (p,0) and Q is (0,q), with sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, because the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So each PQ is a line segment of length 1, moving along the axes.\n\nThen, the problem says that there is a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F except AB. So, AB is part of the family F, right? Because when you take P as A and Q as B, then PQ is AB, which should be of length 1? Wait, let's check: the distance from A to B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So yes, AB is indeed a segment in F. So, point C is on AB, but not equal to A or B, and it doesn't lie on any other segment from F. So, for all other PQ in F, C is not on PQ. We need to find OC\u00b2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express it as p/q, reduced fraction, and find p+q.\n\nAlright, so the key is to find point C on AB such that it's not on any other segment from F except AB.\n\nFirst, let's parametrize AB. Points O, A, B are given. Let's find the equation of line AB.\n\nPoint A is (1/2, 0) and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)*(0) + 0? Wait, wait, let's do it correctly.\n\nWait, the line passes through A (1/2, 0) and B (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, using point-slope form: y - 0 = m(x - 1/2), where m is the slope. The slope is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, equation is y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplify: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nNow, any point C on AB can be parametrized as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) for x between 0 and 1/2.\n\nWe need to find C such that it's not on any other PQ in F except AB.\n\nSo, for any other segment PQ in F, C shouldn't lie on PQ. So, for all PQ in F except AB, the point C is not on PQ.\n\nSo, let's consider what these PQ segments look like. Each PQ connects a point (p,0) on the x-axis to (0,q) on the y-axis, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, the equation of PQ is (x/p) + (y/q) = 1, since it's a line connecting (p,0) and (0,q).\n\nNow, for each PQ in F, the line PQ is x/p + y/q = 1, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe need to find a point C on AB such that for all other PQ (i.e., PQ not equal to AB), C is not on PQ.\n\nSo, the point C is the intersection point of AB with all possible PQs, but only lies on AB and no other PQ.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit vague. Maybe another approach is to consider the envelope of the family F of lines PQ.\n\nWait, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. In this case, perhaps the envelope of the family F is the curve that touches each PQ at exactly one point, and C is the point where AB is tangent to this envelope.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the point C is such that the line AB is tangent to the envelope of F, meaning that C is the point of tangency.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose we have a point C on AB. We need to ensure that for any other PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, for any p, q with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, and PQ being the line x/p + y/q = 1, C is not on PQ unless PQ is AB.\n\nSo, we can set up the condition that for C = (x, y) on AB, the equation x/p + y/q = 1 has no solution except when PQ is AB.\n\nWait, but AB is a specific PQ with p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2, since AB connects (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, for any other p and q, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, the line x/p + y/q =1 should not pass through C.\n\nSo, for point C = (x, y) on AB, we need that for all p, q with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, and (p, q) \u2260 (1/2, sqrt(3)/2), the equation x/p + y/q \u22601.\n\nAlternatively, we can rephrase this: For all p, q with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, except p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2, the equation x/p + y/q \u22601.\n\nWait, but that's a bit abstract. Maybe we can think of it as the point C is not on any other PQ, so for all other PQ, substituting C into the equation gives a false statement.\n\nAlternatively, the point C is the only intersection point between AB and F, meaning that AB is tangent to the envelope of F at C.\n\nHmm, that makes sense. Because if AB is tangent to the envelope, then it touches the envelope at exactly one point, which is C, and doesn't intersect any other PQ in F.\n\nSo, perhaps the envelope of the family F is a curve, and AB is tangent to this curve at point C.\n\nSo, to find the envelope, we can use calculus. The envelope of a family of curves given by F(x, y, p) = 0 is found by solving the system:\n\nF(x, y, p) = 0,\n\ndF/dp = 0.\n\nHere, each PQ can be represented as F(x, y, p) = x/p + y/q -1 =0, but since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, we can express q in terms of p: q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2). But since we are in the first quadrant, q is positive, so q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2).\n\nSo, substituting q, we get F(x, y, p) = x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) -1 =0.\n\nTo find the envelope, we need to solve F(x, y, p)=0 and dF/dp =0.\n\nCompute dF/dp:\n\ndF/dp = -x/p\u00b2 + y*( (1/2)(1 - p\u00b2)^(-3/2) * 2p ) = -x/p\u00b2 + (y p)/ (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2).\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\n-x/p\u00b2 + (y p)/(1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) =0.\n\nSo,\n\n(y p)/(1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) = x/p\u00b2.\n\nMultiply both sides by p\u00b2(1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2):\n\ny p^3 = x (1 - p\u00b2)^2.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) =1,\n\n2) y p^3 = x (1 - p\u00b2)^2.\n\nWe can solve these two equations for x and y in terms of p.\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\nx = (y p^3)/( (1 - p\u00b2)^2 ).\n\nSubstitute x into equation 1:\n\n( (y p^3)/( (1 - p\u00b2)^2 ) ) / p + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n( y p\u00b2 ) / (1 - p\u00b2)^2 + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) =1.\n\nFactor out y:\n\ny [ p\u00b2 / (1 - p\u00b2)^2 + 1 / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ] =1.\n\nLet me compute the expression in brackets:\n\nLet me write (1 - p\u00b2) as t for simplicity. Let t =1 - p\u00b2, so p\u00b2 =1 -t.\n\nThen, the expression becomes:\n\n( (1 - t) ) / t\u00b2 + 1 / sqrt(t).\n\nSo, [ (1 - t)/t\u00b2 + 1/sqrt(t) ].\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let's write everything with denominator t\u00b2.\n\nSo, [ (1 - t) + t^(3/2) ] / t\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, because 1/sqrt(t) is t^(-1/2), which is t^(-1/2). So, to have a common denominator, maybe it's better to compute numerically.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of substitution, let's factor the original expression.\n\nWait, [ p\u00b2 / (1 - p\u00b2)^2 + 1 / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ] = [ p\u00b2 + (1 - p\u00b2)^{3/2} ] / (1 - p\u00b2)^2.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the first term is p\u00b2/(1-p\u00b2)^2, and the second term is 1/sqrt(1-p\u00b2). To add these, we need a common denominator. The first term's denominator is (1-p\u00b2)^2, the second term's denominator is (1-p\u00b2)^{1/2}.\n\nSo, we can write the second term as (1-p\u00b2)^{3/2} / (1-p\u00b2)^2.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n[ p\u00b2 + (1-p\u00b2)^{3/2} ] / (1 - p\u00b2)^2.\n\nSo, putting it back into the equation:\n\ny [ p\u00b2 + (1-p\u00b2)^{3/2} ] / (1 - p\u00b2)^2 =1.\n\nSo, solving for y:\n\ny = (1 - p\u00b2)^2 / [ p\u00b2 + (1 - p\u00b2)^{3/2} ].\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe we can find a substitution or parameterization that makes this easier.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the envelope is a curve, and we can parametrize it in terms of p.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the envelope in terms of an angle. Let me think.\n\nSince each PQ has p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, we can parametrize p = cos\u03b8, q = sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2, because we are in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, let's let p = cos\u03b8, q = sin\u03b8. Then, the equation of PQ is x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nThen, the derivative with respect to \u03b8 is:\n\ndF/d\u03b8 = -x sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo,\n\n- x sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8 to eliminate denominators:\n\n- x sin\u00b3\u03b8 + y cos\u00b3\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo,\n\ny cos\u00b3\u03b8 = x sin\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\ny = x (sin\u00b3\u03b8 / cos\u00b3\u03b8) = x tan\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nSo, from this, we have y = x tan\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nNow, substitute this back into the original equation of PQ:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSubstitute y:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + (x tan\u00b3\u03b8)/ sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + x (sin\u00b3\u03b8 / cos\u00b3\u03b8) / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\nx (sin\u00b3\u03b8) / (cos\u00b3\u03b8 sin\u03b8) )= x sin\u00b2\u03b8 / cos\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + x sin\u00b2\u03b8 / cos\u00b3\u03b8 =1.\n\nFactor x:\n\nx [ 1/cos\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 / cos\u00b3\u03b8 ] =1.\n\nCompute the term in brackets:\n\n1/cos\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 / cos\u00b3\u03b8 = (cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8)/cos\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nSince cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1,\n\n= 1 / cos\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nx / cos\u00b3\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo, x = cos\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nThen, since y =x tan\u00b3\u03b8,\n\ny = cos\u00b3\u03b8 * (sin\u00b3\u03b8 / cos\u00b3\u03b8) = sin\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nSo, the parametric equations for the envelope are:\n\nx = cos\u00b3\u03b8,\n\ny = sin\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nSo, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nWait, because (cos\u00b3\u03b8)^(2/3) + (sin\u00b3\u03b8)^(2/3) = cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo, yes, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nSo, the envelope of the family F is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nNow, the line AB is supposed to be tangent to this astroid at point C.\n\nSo, we need to find the point C where line AB is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nOnce we find C, then OC\u00b2 is just x\u00b2 + y\u00b2.\n\nSo, how do we find the point of tangency between line AB and the astroid?\n\nWe can use the condition that the line AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nThe equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe can substitute this into the astroid equation and set the discriminant to zero to find the point of tangency.\n\nSo, substituting y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nx^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) =1.\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Maybe instead of substituting, we can use calculus.\n\nAlternatively, the condition for tangency is that the line AB touches the astroid at exactly one point, so their intersection has multiplicity one, but since it's a point of tangency, the system has a double root.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to find the derivative of the astroid and set it equal to the slope of AB.\n\nThe astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.\n\nImplicit differentiation:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx =0.\n\nSo,\n\ndy/dx = - [x^(-1/3) ] / [y^(-1/3)] = - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)).\n\nSo, the slope of the astroid at any point (x,y) is - (y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)).\n\nThe slope of AB is -sqrt(3).\n\nSo, at the point of tangency C, the slope of the astroid must equal the slope of AB.\n\nSo,\n\n- (y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3).\n\nSimplify:\n\n(y^(1/3))/(x^(1/3)) = sqrt(3).\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3:\n\ny / x = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3*sqrt(3).\n\nSo,\n\ny = 3*sqrt(3) x.\n\nBut we also know that point C lies on AB, whose equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo, substituting y = 3*sqrt(3) x into AB's equation:\n\n3*sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n3*sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) x - sqrt(3)/2 =0.\n\nFactor sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(3)(4x -1/2) =0.\n\nSince sqrt(3) \u22600,\n\n4x -1/2=0 => x= (1/2)/4 =1/8.\n\nSo, x=1/8.\n\nThen, y=3*sqrt(3)*(1/8)= 3*sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo, point C is (1/8, 3*sqrt(3)/8).\n\nNow, let's check if this point is indeed on the astroid:\n\nx^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = (1/8)^(2/3) + (3*sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/8)^(2/3) = (1^(2/3))/(8^(2/3)) =1/(4) =1/4.\n\n(3*sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3) = [ (3^(3/2)) /8 ]^(2/3) = (3^(3/2))^(2/3) /8^(2/3) )= 3^( (3/2)*(2/3) ) /4= 3^1 /4 =3/4.\n\nSo, 1/4 + 3/4 =1. Perfect, it lies on the astroid.\n\nSo, point C is (1/8, 3*sqrt(3)/8).\n\nNow, compute OC\u00b2:\n\nOC\u00b2 = (1/8)^2 + (3*sqrt(3)/8)^2 =1/64 + (27)/64 = (1 +27)/64=28/64=7/16.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 3*sqrt(3) squared is 9*3=27, yes. So 27/64.\n\n1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16. So, OC\u00b2=7/16.\n\nWait, but 7 and 16 are coprime, so p=7, q=16, p+q=23.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Let me verify that point C is indeed on AB and on the astroid.\n\nWait, AB is from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is approximately (0.5,0) to (0, 0.866).\n\nPoint C is at (1/8, 3*sqrt(3)/8), which is (0.125, approx 0.6495). That lies between O and AB, so it's on AB.\n\nAnd it's on the astroid, as we saw. So, seems correct.\n\nSo, OC\u00b2=7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let's think again about the problem.\n\nThe problem states that C is on AB, and it's the unique point on AB that isn't on any other segment from F except AB. So, the envelope is the astroid, and AB is tangent to the astroid at C, which is the only point of intersection. So, any other PQ in F would intersect AB at some other point, but C is the only point where AB meets the envelope, hence the only point on AB that's on any PQ from F is C, which is on AB itself.\n\nThus, the answer is 7/16, so p+q=23.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first identify the family of segments $\\overline{PQ}$ of unit length in the first quadrant, where $P$ is on the $x$-axis and $Q$ is on the $y$-axis. Each segment $\\overline{PQ}$ lies on the line $\\frac{x}{p} + \\frac{y}{q} = 1$ with $p^2 + q^2 = 1$. \n\nNext, we consider the line segment $\\overline{AB}$, which connects $A\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right)$ and $B\\left(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$. The equation of $\\overline{AB}$ is found to be $y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nWe then determine the envelope of the family of lines $\\frac{x}{p} + \\frac{y}{q} = 1$ with $p^2 + q^2 = 1$. Using calculus, we find the envelope to be the astroid $x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1$.\n\nTo find the unique point $C$ where $\\overline{AB}$ is tangent to the astroid, we set the slope of the astroid equal to the slope of $\\overline{AB}$. This leads to the point $C\\left(\\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\right)$.\n\nFinally, we compute $OC^2$ as $\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{27}{64} = \\frac{28}{64} = \\frac{7}{16}$. Thus, $p = 7$ and $q = 16$, giving $p + q = 23$.\n\n$\\boxed{23}$",
