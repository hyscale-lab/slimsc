      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, alright, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, since |z| = 4, that means z is a complex number lying on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4. So, z can be represented as 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. Alternatively, I can write z as 4(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). That might come in handy later.\n\nThe expression given is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me denote this as E for simplicity. So, E = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.\n\nSince I need the largest possible real part of E, I should probably express E in terms of real and imaginary parts and then find the maximum of the real part. Alternatively, maybe I can rewrite E in a way that makes it easier to handle, perhaps using polar form because of the modulus condition on z.\n\nLet me try expressing z as 4e^{i\u03b8}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}, since 1/z = \\overline{z}/|z|\u00b2, and |z| is 4. So, substituting z and 1/z into E:\n\nE = (75 + 117i)(4e^{i\u03b8}) + (96 + 144i)(1/(4e^{i\u03b8})).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i)*4 e^{i\u03b8} = 4*(75 + 117i) e^{i\u03b8} = (300 + 468i) e^{i\u03b8}.\n\nSecond term: (96 + 144i)/(4 e^{i\u03b8}) = (24 + 36i) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, E = (300 + 468i) e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nHmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can combine these terms. Let me write both terms in terms of cosine and sine. Remember that e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8 and e^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, let's expand each term:\n\nFirst term: (300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) = 300 cos\u03b8 + 300i sin\u03b8 + 468i cos\u03b8 + 468i\u00b2 sin\u03b8.\n\nSince i\u00b2 = -1, this becomes 300 cos\u03b8 + (300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8)i - 468 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, grouping real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary part: (300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8).\n\nSecond term: (24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) = 24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 - 36i\u00b2 sin\u03b8.\n\nAgain, i\u00b2 = -1, so this becomes 24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8.\n\nGrouping real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary part: (-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8).\n\nNow, adding the two expanded terms together for E:\n\nReal part of E: (300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8) + (24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8) = (300 + 24) cos\u03b8 + (-468 + 36) sin\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary part of E: (300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8) + (-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8) = (300 - 24) sin\u03b8 + (468 + 36) cos\u03b8 = 276 sin\u03b8 + 504 cos\u03b8.\n\nSo, E can be written as (324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8) + i(276 sin\u03b8 + 504 cos\u03b8).\n\nBut since we're interested in the real part, let me focus on Re(E) = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, Re(E) = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. I need to find the maximum value of this expression.\n\nHmm, 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. That looks like a linear combination of sine and cosine, which can be written as R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) or something like that, right? The maximum of such an expression is R, where R is the amplitude.\n\nYes, the maximum value of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). Wait, but in this case, the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8, which can be seen as A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 where A = 324 and B = -432.\n\nSo, the maximum value of Re(E) is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)\u00b2). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 324\u00b2: 324 * 324. Let me calculate that.\n\n324 * 300 = 97,200.\n\n324 * 24 = 7,776.\n\nSo, 97,200 + 7,776 = 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432\u00b2: 432 * 432. Let me compute that.\n\n400\u00b2 = 160,000.\n\n32\u00b2 = 1,024.\n\nCross term: 2 * 400 * 32 = 25,600.\n\nSo, (400 + 32)\u00b2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.\n\nWait, no, that's 432\u00b2. Wait, 432 = 400 + 32. So, (a + b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nSo, 400\u00b2 = 160,000, 2ab = 2*400*32=25,600, b\u00b2=32\u00b2=1,024. So total is 160,000 +25,600=185,600 +1,024=186,624.\n\nSo, 324\u00b2 = 104,976; 432\u00b2=186,624.\n\nSo, 324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2 = 104,976 + 186,624.\n\nLet me add those: 104,976 + 186,624. 104,976 + 186,624.\n\nAdding 100,000 + 186,624 = 286,624, then add 4,976: 286,624 +4,976=291,600.\n\nSo sqrt(291,600). Let me compute that.\n\nWhat's sqrt(291600). Let's see, 540\u00b2=291,600 because 500\u00b2=250,000, 540\u00b2= (500+40)^2=500\u00b2 + 2*500*40 +40\u00b2=250,000 +40,000 +1,600=291,600. Yes, so sqrt(291,600)=540.\n\nSo, the maximum value of Re(E) is 540. So, the largest possible real part is 540.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nSo, Re(E)=324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. The maximum is sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2)=sqrt(291600)=540. That seems correct.\n\nLet me double-check the steps where I expanded the terms.\n\nFirst, I expressed z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, which is correct because |z|=4.\n\nThen, the first term: (75 +117i)*4 e^{i\u03b8} = (300 +468i) e^{i\u03b8}, which is correct.\n\nThe second term: (96 +144i)/(4 e^{i\u03b8})=24 +36i multiplied by e^{-i\u03b8}, which is correct.\n\nExpanding both terms:\n\nFirst term expansion:\n\n(300 +468i)(cos\u03b8 +i sin\u03b8) = 300 cos\u03b8 + 300 i sin\u03b8 +468i cos\u03b8 +468 i\u00b2 sin\u03b8.\n\nWhich simplifies to 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8 + i(300 sin\u03b8 +468 cos\u03b8). That's correct.\n\nSecond term expansion:\n\n(24 +36i)(cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8)=24 cos\u03b8 -24 i sin\u03b8 +36i cos\u03b8 -36 i\u00b2 sin\u03b8.\n\nWhich is 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 +i(-24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8). Correct.\n\nAdding real parts: 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8 +24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8= (324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8). Correct.\n\nImaginary parts: 300 sin\u03b8 +468 cos\u03b8 -24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8= 276 sin\u03b8 +504 cos\u03b8. Correct.\n\nSo, Re(E)=324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Then, the maximum of Re(E) is sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2)=540.\n\nHmm, so that seems to be correct.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to express the entire expression E in terms of z and 1/z, and then note that since |z|=4, 1/z is the conjugate of z divided by |z|\u00b2. Maybe that could lead somewhere, but the approach I took seems to have worked.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that for any complex number w, Re(w) is maximized when w is a positive real number, so perhaps setting E to be a positive real number would give the maximum. But I'm not sure if that's the case here because E is a combination of two terms. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps writing E as (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z, and since |z|=4, perhaps let me denote w = z, so |w|=4. Then E = (75+117i)w + (96+144i)/w.\n\nLet me write this as E = (75+117i)w + (96+144i) \\overline{w}/(4), since 1/w = \\overline{w}/|w|\u00b2 = \\overline{w}/16.\n\nSo, E = (75 +117i)w + (96 +144i)/16 \\overline{w}.\n\nHmm, 96/16=6, 144/16=9. So, E = (75 +117i)w + (6 +9i) \\overline{w}.\n\nSo, E = (75 +117i)w + (6 +9i) \\overline{w}.\n\nNow, if I write w = a + ib, then \\overline{w} = a - ib. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps express w in terms of its real and imaginary parts, but that might get too involved.\n\nAlternatively, note that for any complex number w with |w|=4, we can write w = 4 e^{i\u03b8}, as I did earlier, which is what I think I did correctly.\n\nWait, but in this alternative approach, E = (75 +117i)w + (6 +9i) \\overline{w}.\n\nLet me compute this expression. Let me write (75 +117i)w as a complex number, and (6 +9i) \\overline{w} as another.\n\nSince w = 4 e^{i\u03b8}, then \\overline{w} = 4 e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, E = (75 +117i)*4 e^{i\u03b8} + (6 +9i)*4 e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nWhich is 4*(75 +117i) e^{i\u03b8} + 4*(6 +9i) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 96 +144i in the numerator, which divided by 4 gave 24 +36i. Wait, but in this approach, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, the original problem is (96 +144i)/z, which is (96 +144i)/z. Since |z|=4, 1/z = \\overline{z}/16, so (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i) \\overline{z}/16. Which is (6 +9i) \\overline{z}. So, in terms of w, E = (75 +117i)w + (6 +9i) \\overline{w}.\n\nSo, E = (75 +117i)w + (6 +9i)\\overline{w}.\n\nLet me compute this expression. Let me denote w = a + ib, then \\overline{w} = a - ib.\n\nBut maybe it's better to compute E as a function of \u03b8.\n\nSo, E = (75 +117i)*4 e^{i\u03b8} + (6 +9i)*4 e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nWhich is 4*(75 +117i) e^{i\u03b8} + 4*(6 +9i) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 4*(75 +117i) e^{i\u03b8} = (300 +468i) e^{i\u03b8}.\n\nSecond term: 4*(6 +9i) e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 +36i) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, E = (300 +468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nWhich is the same as before. So, I think my initial approach was correct.\n\nSo, Re(E) = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. The maximum of this is 540, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can think of Re(E) as R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is the amplitude. So, R = sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540. So, the maximum value of Re(E) is 540.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 540.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I should consider whether I can get a higher value by considering another approach, perhaps using calculus or some optimization.\n\nAlternatively, since Re(E) is a function of \u03b8, I can take its derivative with respect to \u03b8 and set it to zero to find the maximum.\n\nSo, Re(E) = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8.\n\nThe derivative with respect to \u03b8 is -324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8.\n\nSetting derivative to zero: -324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8 = 0.\n\nSo, 324 sin\u03b8 + 432 cos\u03b8 = 0.\n\nDividing both sides by 108: 3 sin\u03b8 + 4 cos\u03b8 = 0.\n\nSo, 3 sin\u03b8 = -4 cos\u03b8.\n\nDividing both sides by cos\u03b8 (assuming cos\u03b8 \u22600), we get 3 tan\u03b8 = -4.\n\nSo, tan\u03b8 = -4/3.\n\nSo, \u03b8 is in either the second or fourth quadrant.\n\nLet me compute \u03b8 as arctangent of -4/3. So, \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3).\n\nSo, possible \u03b8 are in the second and fourth quadrants.\n\nBut then, I can plug this \u03b8 back into Re(E) to find the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, since I already know that the maximum is 540, this approach would just confirm it, but let's try.\n\nSo, from tan\u03b8 = -4/3, we can represent this as a right triangle where the opposite side is -4 and adjacent is 3 (in the fourth quadrant) or opposite is 4 and adjacent is -3 (in the second quadrant). The hypotenuse would be 5 in either case.\n\nSo, cos\u03b8 = 3/5 or -3/5, depending on the quadrant.\n\nSimilarly, sin\u03b8 = -4/5 or 4/5.\n\nSo, let's compute Re(E) at these \u03b8.\n\nCase 1: \u03b8 in fourth quadrant: cos\u03b8 = 3/5, sin\u03b8 = -4/5.\n\nRe(E) = 324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = (972 +1728)/5 = 2700/5 = 540.\n\nCase 2: \u03b8 in second quadrant: cos\u03b8 = -3/5, sin\u03b8 = 4/5.\n\nRe(E) = 324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5) = (-972/5) - (1728/5) = (-2700)/5 = -540.\n\nSo, the maximum value is indeed 540.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible real part is 540.\n",

That looks like a linear combination of sine and cosine, which can be written as R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) or something like that, right? The maximum of such an expression is R, where R is the amplitude.\n\nYes, the maximum value of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). Wait, but in this case, the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8, which can be seen as A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 where A = 324 and B = -432.\n\nSo, the maximum value of Re(E) is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)\u00b2). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 324\u00b2: 324 * 324. Let me calculate that.\n\n324 * 300 = 97,200.\n\n324 * 24 = 7,776.\n\nSo, 97,200 + 7,776 = 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432\u00b2: 432 * 432. Let me compute that.\n\n400\u00b2 = 160,000.\n\n32\u00b2 = 1,024.\n\nCross term: 2 * 400 * 32 = 25,600.\n\nSo, (400 + 32)\u00b2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.\n\nWait, no, that's 432\u00b2. Wait, 432 = 400 + 32. So, (a + b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nSo, 400\u00b2 = 160,000, 2ab = 2*400*32=25,600, b\u00b2=32\u00b2=1,024. So total is 160,000 +25,600=185,600 +1,024=186,624.\n\nSo, 324\u00b2 = 104,976; 432\u00b2=186,624.\n\nSo, 324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2 = 104,976 + 186,624.\n\nLet me add those: 104,976 + 186,624. 104,976 + 186,624.\n\nAdding 100,000 + 186,624 = 286,624, then add 4,976: 286,624 +4,976=291,600.\n\nSo sqrt(291,600). Let me compute that.\n\nWhat's sqrt(291600). Let's see, 540\u00b2=291,600 because 500\u00b2=250,000, 540\u00b2= (500+40)^2=500\u00b2 + 2*500*40 +40\u00b2=250,000 +40,000 +1,600=291,600. Yes, so sqrt(291,600)=540.\n\nSo, the maximum value of Re(E) is 540. So, the largest possible real part is 540.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nSo, Re(E)=324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. The maximum is sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2)=sqrt(291600)=540. That seems correct.\n\nLet me double-check the steps where I expanded the terms.\n\nFirst, I expressed z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, which is correct because |z|=4.\n\nThen, the first term: (75 +117i)*4 e^{i\u03b8} = (300 +468i) e^{i\u03b8}, which is correct.\n\nThe second term: (96 +144i)/(4 e^{i\u03b8})=24 +36i multiplied by e^{-i\u03b8}, which is correct.\n\nExpanding both terms:\n\nFirst term expansion:\n\n(300 +468i)(cos\u03b8 +i sin\u03b8) = 300 cos\u03b8 + 300 i sin\u03b8 +468i cos\u03b8 +468 i\u00b2 sin\u03b8.\n\nWhich simplifies to 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8 + i(300 sin\u03b8 +468 cos\u03b8). That's correct.\n\nSecond term expansion:\n\n(24 +36i)(cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8)=24 cos\u03b8 -24 i sin\u03b8 +36i cos\u03b8 -36 i\u00b2 sin\u03b8.\n\nWhich is 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 +i(-24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8). Correct.\n\nAdding real parts: 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8 +24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8= (324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8). Correct.\n\nImaginary parts: 300 sin\u03b8 +468 cos\u03b8 -24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8= 276 sin\u03b8 +504 cos\u03b8. Correct.\n\nSo, Re(E)=324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Then, the maximum of Re(E) is sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2)=540.\n\nHmm, so that seems to be correct.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to express the entire expression E in terms of z and 1/z, and then note that since |z|=4, 1/z is the conjugate of z divided by |z|\u00b2. Maybe that could lead somewhere, but the approach I took seems to have worked.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that for any complex number w, Re(w) is maximized when w is a positive real number, so perhaps setting E to be a positive real number would give the maximum. But I'm not sure if that's the case here because E is a combination of two terms. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps writing E as (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z, and since |z|=4, perhaps let me denote w = z, so |w|=4. Then E = (75+117i)w + (96+144i)/w.\n\nLet me write this as E = (75+117i)w + (96+144i) \\overline{w}/(4), since 1/w = \\overline{w}/|w|\u00b2 = \\overline{w}/16.\n\nSo, E = (75 +117i)w + (96 +144i)/16 \\overline{w}.\n\nHmm, 96/16=6, 144/16=9. So, E = (75 +117i)w + (6 +9i) \\overline{w}.\n\nSo, E = (75 +117i)w + (6 +9i) \\overline{w}.\n\nNow, if I write w = a + ib, then \\overline{w} = a - ib. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps express w in terms of its real and imaginary parts, but that might get too involved.\n\nAlternatively, note that for any complex number w with |w|=4, we can write w = 4 e^{i\u03b8}, as I did earlier, which is what I think I did correctly.\n\nWait, but in this alternative approach, E = (75 +117i)w + (6 +9i) \\overline{w}.\n\nLet me compute this expression. Let me write (75 +117i)w as a complex number, and (6 +9i) \\overline{w} as another.\n\nSince w = 4 e^{i\u03b8}, then \\overline{w} = 4 e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, E = (75 +117i)*4 e^{i\u03b8} + (6 +9i)*4 e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nWhich is 4*(75 +117i) e^{i\u03b8} + 4*(6 +9i) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 96 +144i in the numerator, which divided by 4 gave 24 +36i. Wait, but in this approach, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, the original problem is (96 +144i)/z, which is (96 +144i)/z. Since |z|=4, 1/z = \\overline{z}/16, so (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i) \\overline{z}/16. Which is (6 +9i) \\overline{z}. So, in terms of w, E = (75 +117i)w + (6 +9i) \\overline{w}.\n\nSo, E = (75 +117i)w + (6 +9i)\\overline{w}.\n\nLet me compute this expression. Let me denote w = a + ib, then \\overline{w} = a - ib.\n\nBut maybe it's better to compute E as a function of \u03b8.\n\nSo, E = (75 +117i)*4 e^{i\u03b8} + (6 +9i)*4 e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nWhich is 4*(75 +117i) e^{i\u03b8} + 4*(6 +9i) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 4*(75 +117i) e^{i\u03b8} = (300 +468i) e^{i\u03b8}.\n\nSecond term: 4*(6 +9i) e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 +36i) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, E = (300 +468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nWhich is the same as before. So, I think my initial approach was correct.\n\nSo, Re(E) = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. The maximum of this is 540, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can think of Re(E) as R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is the amplitude. So, R = sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540. So, the maximum value of Re(E) is 540.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 540.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I should consider whether I can get a higher value by considering another approach, perhaps using calculus or some optimization.\n\nAlternatively, since Re(E) is a function of \u03b8, I can take its derivative with respect to \u03b8 and set it to zero to find the maximum.\n\nSo, Re(E) = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8.\n\nThe derivative with respect to \u03b8 is -324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8.\n\nSetting derivative to zero: -324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8 = 0.\n\nSo, 324 sin\u03b8 + 432 cos\u03b8 = 0.\n\nDividing both sides by 108: 3 sin\u03b8 + 4 cos\u03b8 = 0.\n\nSo, 3 sin\u03b8 = -4 cos\u03b8.\n\nDividing both sides by cos\u03b8 (assuming cos\u03b8 \u22600), we get 3 tan\u03b8 = -4.\n\nSo, tan\u03b8 = -4/3.\n\nSo, \u03b8 is in either the second or fourth quadrant.\n\nLet me compute \u03b8 as arctangent of -4/3. So, \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3).\n\nSo, possible \u03b8 are in the second and fourth quadrants.\n\nBut then, I can plug this \u03b8 back into Re(E) to find the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, since I already know that the maximum is 540, this approach would just confirm it, but let's try.\n\nSo, from tan\u03b8 = -4/3, we can represent this as a right triangle where the opposite side is -4 and adjacent is 3 (in the fourth quadrant) or opposite is 4 and adjacent is -3 (in the second quadrant). The hypotenuse would be 5 in either case.\n\nSo, cos\u03b8 = 3/5 or -3/5, depending on the quadrant.\n\nSimilarly, sin\u03b8 = -4/5 or 4/5.\n\nSo, let's compute Re(E) at these \u03b8.\n\nCase 1: \u03b8 in fourth quadrant: cos\u03b8 = 3/5, sin\u03b8 = -4/5.\n\nRe(E) = 324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = (972 +1728)/5 = 2700/5 = 540.\n\nCase 2: \u03b8 in second quadrant: cos\u03b8 = -3/5, sin\u03b8 = 4/5.\n\nRe(E) = 324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5) = (-972/5) - (1728/5) = (-2700)/5 = -540.\n\nSo, the maximum value is indeed 540.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible real part is 540.\n\n\nTo find the largest possible real part of the expression \\[(75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\] where \\(z\\) is a complex number with \\(|z| = 4\\), we start by expressing \\(z\\) in polar form as \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\) and \\(1/z = \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta}\\) into the expression, we get:\n\\[\nE = (75 + 117i) \\cdot 4e^{i\\theta} + \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}}\n\\]\nSimplifying each term:\n\\[\nE = (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\n\\]\nExpanding using Euler's formula \\(e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta\\) and \\(e^{-i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta\\), we separate the real and imaginary parts:\n\\[\n\\text{Re}(E) = 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta\n\\]\nThe maximum value of a linear combination \\(A\\cos\\theta + B\\sin\\theta\\) is \\(\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this complex number problem to solve. Let me read it again: Find the largest possible real part of [(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z] where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay. So, z is a complex number on the circle with radius 4. I need to maximize the real part of this expression.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since z is a complex number with |z| = 4, I can represent z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. That might make things easier because then I can express everything in terms of \u03b8 and then try to find the maximum real part by taking derivatives or something.\n\nSo, let's let z = 4e^{i\u03b8}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}, because 1/z is the conjugate of z divided by |z|\u00b2, which is 16 here, so 1/z is (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, substituting z into the expression:\n\n(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z\n= (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}\n= [4*(75 + 117i)]e^{i\u03b8} + [(96 + 144i)/4]e^{-i\u03b8}\n= [300 + 468i]e^{i\u03b8} + [24 + 36i]e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nHmm, okay. So, I can write this as A e^{i\u03b8} + B e^{-i\u03b8}, where A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i.\n\nNow, I want to find the real part of this expression. So, let's compute Re[A e^{i\u03b8} + B e^{-i\u03b8}].\n\nThe real part of A e^{i\u03b8} is Re[A] cos\u03b8 - Im[A] sin\u03b8, and the real part of B e^{-i\u03b8} is Re[B] cos\u03b8 + Im[B] sin\u03b8. Wait, no, let me think again. When you multiply a complex number by e^{i\u03b8}, the real part is Re(A) cos\u03b8 - Im(A) sin\u03b8, and the imaginary part is Re(A) sin\u03b8 + Im(A) cos\u03b8. Similarly, for e^{-i\u03b8}, it's Re(B) cos\u03b8 + Im(B) sin\u03b8 for the real part, and Re(B) (-sin\u03b8) + Im(B) cos\u03b8 for the imaginary part.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to compute A e^{i\u03b8} + B e^{-i\u03b8} and then take its real part. Let me compute each term separately.\n\nCompute A e^{i\u03b8}:\nA = 300 + 468i\ne^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8\nSo, A e^{i\u03b8} = (300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)\n= 300 cos\u03b8 + 300 i sin\u03b8 + 468i cos\u03b8 + 468 i^2 sin\u03b8\n= 300 cos\u03b8 + (300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8)i - 468 sin\u03b8\nSo, real part is 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, compute B e^{-i\u03b8}:\nB = 24 + 36i\ne^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8\nSo, B e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8)\n= 24 cos\u03b8 - 24 i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 - 36 i^2 sin\u03b8\n= 24 cos\u03b8 + (36 cos\u03b8 - 24 sin\u03b8)i + 36 sin\u03b8\nSo, real part is 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8.\n\nAdding both real parts together:\n\nReal part of A e^{i\u03b8} + B e^{-i\u03b8} = [300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8] + [24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8]\n= (300 + 24) cos\u03b8 + (-468 + 36) sin\u03b8\n= 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, the expression we're trying to maximize is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nHmm, that's a linear combination of cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8. I remember that any expression of the form a cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8 can be rewritten as R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) and \u03c6 is some angle. Alternatively, it can also be written as R sin(\u03b8 + \u03c6), depending on the phase shift.\n\nSo, in this case, a = 324 and b = -432. Let me compute R:\n\nR = sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2)\n= sqrt( (324)^2 + (432)^2 )\n\nLet me compute 324 squared and 432 squared.\n\n324^2: 324 is 18^2 * 1 (18*18=324). So, 324^2 = (324)^2 = let me compute 300^2=90000, 24^2=576, and 2*300*24=14400. So, (300+24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2=90000 + 14400 + 576= 90000+14400=104400; 104400+576=104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432^2: 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400+32)^2=400^2 + 2*400*32 +32^2=160,000 +25,600 +1,024= 160,000+25,600=185,600; 185,600 +1,024= 186,624.\n\nSo, R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600). Hmm, sqrt(291600). Let me see, 540^2=291,600 because 500^2=250,000, 40^2=1,600, 2*500*40=40,000; so (500+40)^2=500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2=250,000+40,000+1,600=291,600. So R=540.\n\nSo, R=540. Therefore, 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 = 540 cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where \u03c6 is some angle. The maximum value of this expression is R, which is 540, because the maximum of cos is 1.\n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Because I expressed it as R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), which has a maximum of R. So yes, the maximum possible real part is 540.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 540.\n\nBut let me double-check my steps. I set z=4e^{i\u03b8}, then substituted into the expression, expanded it, found the real part, which turned into 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Then, I found the amplitude R=540, so the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, but let me verify the calculation of R again. 324^2 is 104,976, 432^2 is 186,624. Adding them gives 291,600. sqrt(291,600) is indeed 540, because 540*540=291,600.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about using calculus. Let me consider f(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Then, df/d\u03b8 = -324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8. Setting derivative to zero: -324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8=0 \u2192 324 sin\u03b8 +432 cos\u03b8=0 \u2192 324 sin\u03b8 = -432 cos\u03b8 \u2192 tan\u03b8 = (-432)/324 = -4/3.\n\nSo, \u03b8 is such that tan\u03b8 = -4/3. So, \u03b8 is in the second or fourth quadrant.\n\nBut when tan\u03b8 = -4/3, we can think of a right triangle with opposite side -4 and adjacent 3, so hypotenuse is 5. Therefore, sin\u03b8 = -4/5 or 4/5, cos\u03b8=3/5 or -3/5, depending on the quadrant.\n\nWait, but when tan\u03b8 = -4/3, the angle \u03b8 could be in the second or fourth quadrant.\n\nLet's take \u03b8 in the fourth quadrant first, so cos\u03b8=3/5 and sin\u03b8=-4/5.\n\nThen, f(\u03b8)=324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5)= (972/5) + (1728/5)= (972 +1728)/5=2700/5=540.\n\nSimilarly, if \u03b8 is in the second quadrant, cos\u03b8=-3/5 and sin\u03b8=4/5.\n\nThen, f(\u03b8)=324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5)= (-972/5) - (1728/5)= (-2700)/5= -540.\n\nSo, the maximum is 540, and the minimum is -540. So, yeah, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the maximum real part is 540.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this complex number problem to solve. Let me read it again: Find the largest possible real part of [(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z] where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay. So, z is a complex number on the circle with radius 4. I need to maximize the real part of this expression.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since z is a complex number with |z| = 4, I can represent z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. That might make things easier because then I can express everything in terms of \u03b8 and then try to find the maximum real part by taking derivatives or something.\n\nSo, let's let z = 4e^{i\u03b8}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}, because 1/z is the conjugate of z divided by |z|\u00b2, which is 16 here, so 1/z is (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, substituting z into the expression:\n\n(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z\n= (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}\n= [4*(75 + 117i)]e^{i\u03b8} + [(96 + 144i)/4]e^{-i\u03b8}\n= [300 + 468i]e^{i\u03b8} + [24 + 36i]e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nHmm, okay. So, I can write this as A e^{i\u03b8} + B e^{-i\u03b8}, where A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i.\n\nNow, I want to find the real part of this expression. So, let's compute Re[A e^{i\u03b8} + B e^{-i\u03b8}].\n\nThe real part of A e^{i\u03b8} is Re[A] cos\u03b8 - Im[A] sin\u03b8, and the real part of B e^{-i\u03b8} is Re[B] cos\u03b8 + Im[B] sin\u03b8. Wait, no, let me think again. When you multiply a complex number by e^{i\u03b8}, the real part is Re(A) cos\u03b8 - Im(A) sin\u03b8, and the imaginary part is Re(A) sin\u03b8 + Im(A) cos\u03b8. Similarly, for e^{-i\u03b8}, it's Re(B) cos\u03b8 + Im(B) sin\u03b8 for the real part, and Re(B) (-sin\u03b8) + Im(B) cos\u03b8 for the imaginary part.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to compute A e^{i\u03b8} + B e^{-i\u03b8} and then take its real part. Let me compute each term separately.\n\nCompute A e^{i\u03b8}:\nA = 300 + 468i\ne^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8\nSo, A e^{i\u03b8} = (300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)\n= 300 cos\u03b8 + 300 i sin\u03b8 + 468i cos\u03b8 + 468 i^2 sin\u03b8\n= 300 cos\u03b8 + (300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8)i - 468 sin\u03b8\nSo, real part is 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, compute B e^{-i\u03b8}:\nB = 24 + 36i\ne^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8\nSo, B e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8)\n= 24 cos\u03b8 - 24 i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 - 36 i^2 sin\u03b8\n= 24 cos\u03b8 + (36 cos\u03b8 - 24 sin\u03b8)i + 36 sin\u03b8\nSo, real part is 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8.\n\nAdding both real parts together:\n\nReal part of A e^{i\u03b8} + B e^{-i\u03b8} = [300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8] + [24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8]\n= (300 + 24) cos\u03b8 + (-468 + 36) sin\u03b8\n= 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, the expression we're trying to maximize is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nHmm, that's a linear combination of cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8. I remember that any expression of the form a cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8 can be rewritten as R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) and \u03c6 is some angle. Alternatively, it can also be written as R sin(\u03b8 + \u03c6), depending on the phase shift.\n\nSo, in this case, a = 324 and b = -432. Let me compute R:\n\nR = sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2)\n= sqrt( (324)^2 + (432)^2 )\n\nLet me compute 324 squared and 432 squared.\n\n324^2: 324 is 18^2 * 1 (18*18=324). So, 324^2 = (324)^2 = let me compute 300^2=90000, 24^2=576, and 2*300*24=14400. So, (300+24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2=90000 + 14400 + 576= 90000+14400=104400; 104400+576=104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432^2: 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400+32)^2=400^2 + 2*400*32 +32^2=160,000 +25,600 +1,024= 160,000+25,600=185,600; 185,600 +1,024= 186,624.\n\nSo, R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600). Hmm, sqrt(291600). Let me see, 540^2=291,600 because 500^2=250,000, 40^2=1,600, 2*500*40=40,000; so (500+40)^2=500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2=250,000+40,000+1,600=291,600. So R=540.\n\nSo, R=540. Therefore, 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 = 540 cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where \u03c6 is some angle. The maximum value of this expression is R, which is 540, because the maximum of cos is 1.\n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Because I expressed it as R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), which has a maximum of R. So yes, the maximum possible real part is 540.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 540.\n\nBut let me double-check my steps. I set z=4e^{i\u03b8}, then substituted into the expression, expanded it, found the real part, which turned into 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Then, I found the amplitude R=540, so the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, but let me verify the calculation of R again. 324^2 is 104,976, 432^2 is 186,624. Adding them gives 291,600. sqrt(291,600) is indeed 540, because 540*540=291,600.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about using calculus. Let me consider f(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Then, df/d\u03b8 = -324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8. Setting derivative to zero: -324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8=0 \u2192 324 sin\u03b8 +432 cos\u03b8=0 \u2192 324 sin\u03b8 = -432 cos\u03b8 \u2192 tan\u03b8 = (-432)/324 = -4/3.\n\nSo, \u03b8 is such that tan\u03b8 = -4/3. So, \u03b8 is in the second or fourth quadrant.\n\nBut when tan\u03b8 = -4/3, we can think of a right triangle with opposite side -4 and adjacent 3, so hypotenuse is 5. Therefore, sin\u03b8 = -4/5 or 4/5, cos\u03b8=3/5 or -3/5, depending on the quadrant.\n\nWait, but when tan\u03b8 = -4/3, the angle \u03b8 could be in the second or fourth quadrant.\n\nLet's take \u03b8 in the fourth quadrant first, so cos\u03b8=3/5 and sin\u03b8=-4/5.\n\nThen, f(\u03b8)=324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5)= (972/5) + (1728/5)= (972 +1728)/5=2700/5=540.\n\nSimilarly, if \u03b8 is in the second quadrant, cos\u03b8=-3/5 and sin\u03b8=4/5.\n\nThen, f(\u03b8)=324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5)= (-972/5) - (1728/5)= (-2700)/5= -540.\n\nSo, the maximum is 540, and the minimum is -540. So, yeah, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the maximum real part is 540.\n\n\nTo find the largest possible real part of the expression \\((75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\) where \\(|z| = 4\\), we start by expressing \\(z\\) as \\(4e^{i\\theta}\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that any complex number z can be expressed in polar form. Since the magnitude of z is 4, I can write z as 4 * e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. Alternatively, I could write z as 4*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). But maybe working with exponentials might make things easier when dealing with reciprocals and such.\n\nWait, actually, if z is 4 e^{i\u03b8}, then 1/z would be (1/4) e^{-i\u03b8}, because 1/z = conjugate(z)/|z|\u00b2. Since |z| is 4, |z|\u00b2 is 16, so yeah, 1/z is (1/4) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, let me write the expression in terms of \u03b8. Let's denote z = 4 e^{i\u03b8}. Then, the expression becomes:\n\n(75 + 117i) * 4 e^{i\u03b8} + (96 + 144i) * (1/(4 e^{i\u03b8})).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: 4*(75 + 117i) e^{i\u03b8} = (300 + 468i) e^{i\u03b8}.\n\nSecond term: (96 + 144i)/4 = 24 + 36i, so the second term is (24 + 36i) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo now the expression is (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nHmm, maybe I can represent these complex numbers in terms of their real and imaginary parts. Let me denote A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i.\n\nSo the expression is A e^{i\u03b8} + B e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nI know that for a complex number multiplied by e^{i\u03b8}, it's like rotating the complex number by \u03b8 radians. Similarly for e^{-i\u03b8}, it's rotating in the opposite direction.\n\nBut I need to find the real part of this expression. So, Re[A e^{i\u03b8} + B e^{-i\u03b8}].\n\nI can use the fact that Re[Ce^{i\u03b8}] = Re[C] cos\u03b8 - Im[C] sin\u03b8, right? Because e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8, so when you multiply by C = a + ib, the real part is a cos\u03b8 - b sin\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, Re[Ce^{-i\u03b8}] = Re[C] cos\u03b8 + Im[C] sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Let's compute Re[C e^{-i\u03b8}].\n\nC e^{-i\u03b8} = (a + ib)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) = a cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8 + i(-a sin\u03b8 + b cos\u03b8). So the real part is a cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, Re[C e^{i\u03b8}] = a cos\u03b8 - b sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, combining these two, Re[A e^{i\u03b8} + B e^{-i\u03b8}] = Re[A e^{i\u03b8}] + Re[B e^{-i\u03b8}] = (Re[A] cos\u03b8 - Im[A] sin\u03b8) + (Re[B] cos\u03b8 + Im[B] sin\u03b8).\n\nLet me write this out:\n\n= (Re[A] + Re[B]) cos\u03b8 + (-Im[A] + Im[B]) sin\u03b8.\n\nNow, substituting Re[A] = 300, Im[A] = 468, Re[B] = 24, Im[B] = 36.\n\nSo:\n\n= (300 + 24) cos\u03b8 + (-468 + 36) sin\u03b8.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n= 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, the real part of the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to \u03b8.\n\nHmm, this looks like a function of \u03b8: f(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form a cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8 can be rewritten as R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is the amplitude, given by sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). Alternatively, the maximum value of such an expression is R.\n\nWait, but in this case, the coefficients are 324 and -432, so it's 324 cos\u03b8 + (-432) sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, to find the maximum of f(\u03b8), I can compute R = sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)\u00b2).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, compute 324 squared:\n\n324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 = 104400; 104400 + 576 = 104976.\n\nNow, 432 squared:\n\n432^2 = (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160000 + 25600 + 1024.\n\n160000 + 25600 = 185600; 185600 + 1024 = 186624.\n\nBut since the coefficient is -432, the square is the same, 186624.\n\nSo R = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600).\n\nWait, 291600, let me compute sqrt(291600).\n\nI know that 540^2 is 291600, because 54^2 is 2916, so 540^2 is 291600. So R = 540.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of f(\u03b8) is 540.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So f(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. The maximum of a cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8 is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So yes, that would be 540.\n\nSo the largest possible real part is 540.\n\nWait a second, but let me check the steps again because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic.\n\nCompute 324\u00b2:\n\n324 * 324: Let's compute 300*300=90000, 300*24=7200, 24*300=7200, 24*24=576.\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Actually, 324*324:\n\nBreak it down as (300 + 24)^2 = 300\u00b2 + 2*300*24 + 24\u00b2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 = 104400; 104400 + 576 = 104976. Correct.\n\n432\u00b2: 432 * 432.\n\nLet me compute 400*400 = 160000, 400*32 = 12800, 32*400=12800, 32*32=1024.\n\nWait, no, that's not the way. 432^2 = (400 + 32)^2 = 400\u00b2 + 2*400*32 + 32\u00b2 = 160000 + 25600 + 1024.\n\n160000 + 25600 = 185600; 185600 + 1024 = 186624. Correct.\n\nSo 324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2 = 104976 + 186624 = 291600.\n\nsqrt(291600) = 540. Correct.\n\nSo the maximum real part is 540. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, so the expression was (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z, with |z|=4.\n\nI set z=4 e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z = (1/4) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nThen, (75+117i)*4 e^{i\u03b8} = (300 + 468i) e^{i\u03b8}.\n\n(96+144i)/(4 e^{i\u03b8}) = (24 + 36i) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo the real part becomes Re[(300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)] + Re[(24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8)].\n\nWhich is Re[300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8 + i(300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8)] + Re[24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8 + i(-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8)].\n\nTaking the real parts:\n\n= (300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8) + (24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8)\n\n= (300 +24) cos\u03b8 + (-468 +36) sin\u03b8\n\n= 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, yes, the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nWhich is a linear combination of cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8, so its maximum is sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540.\n\nSo the maximum real part is 540.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 540.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that any complex number z can be expressed in polar form. Since the magnitude of z is 4, I can write z as 4 * e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. Alternatively, I could write z as 4*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). But maybe working with exponentials might make things easier when dealing with reciprocals and such.\n\nWait, actually, if z is 4 e^{i\u03b8}, then 1/z would be (1/4) e^{-i\u03b8}, because 1/z = conjugate(z)/|z|\u00b2. Since |z| is 4, |z|\u00b2 is 16, so yeah, 1/z is (1/4) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, let me write the expression in terms of \u03b8. Let's denote z = 4 e^{i\u03b8}. Then, the expression becomes:\n\n(75 + 117i) * 4 e^{i\u03b8} + (96 + 144i) * (1/(4 e^{i\u03b8})).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: 4*(75 + 117i) e^{i\u03b8} = (300 + 468i) e^{i\u03b8}.\n\nSecond term: (96 + 144i)/4 = 24 + 36i, so the second term is (24 + 36i) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo now the expression is (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nHmm, maybe I can represent these complex numbers in terms of their real and imaginary parts. Let me denote A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i.\n\nSo the expression is A e^{i\u03b8} + B e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nI know that for a complex number multiplied by e^{i\u03b8}, it's like rotating the complex number by \u03b8 radians. Similarly for e^{-i\u03b8}, it's rotating in the opposite direction.\n\nBut I need to find the real part of this expression. So, Re[A e^{i\u03b8} + B e^{-i\u03b8}].\n\nI can use the fact that Re[Ce^{i\u03b8}] = Re[C] cos\u03b8 - Im[C] sin\u03b8, right? Because e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8, so when you multiply by C = a + ib, the real part is a cos\u03b8 - b sin\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, Re[Ce^{-i\u03b8}] = Re[C] cos\u03b8 + Im[C] sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Let's compute Re[C e^{-i\u03b8}].\n\nC e^{-i\u03b8} = (a + ib)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) = a cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8 + i(-a sin\u03b8 + b cos\u03b8). So the real part is a cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, Re[C e^{i\u03b8}] = a cos\u03b8 - b sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, combining these two, Re[A e^{i\u03b8} + B e^{-i\u03b8}] = Re[A e^{i\u03b8}] + Re[B e^{-i\u03b8}] = (Re[A] cos\u03b8 - Im[A] sin\u03b8) + (Re[B] cos\u03b8 + Im[B] sin\u03b8).\n\nLet me write this out:\n\n= (Re[A] + Re[B]) cos\u03b8 + (-Im[A] + Im[B]) sin\u03b8.\n\nNow, substituting Re[A] = 300, Im[A] = 468, Re[B] = 24, Im[B] = 36.\n\nSo:\n\n= (300 + 24) cos\u03b8 + (-468 + 36) sin\u03b8.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n= 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, the real part of the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to \u03b8.\n\nHmm, this looks like a function of \u03b8: f(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form a cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8 can be rewritten as R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is the amplitude, given by sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). Alternatively, the maximum value of such an expression is R.\n\nWait, but in this case, the coefficients are 324 and -432, so it's 324 cos\u03b8 + (-432) sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, to find the maximum of f(\u03b8), I can compute R = sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)\u00b2).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, compute 324 squared:\n\n324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 = 104400; 104400 + 576 = 104976.\n\nNow, 432 squared:\n\n432^2 = (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160000 + 25600 + 1024.\n\n160000 + 25600 = 185600; 185600 + 1024 = 186624.\n\nBut since the coefficient is -432, the square is the same, 186624.\n\nSo R = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600).\n\nWait, 291600, let me compute sqrt(291600).\n\nI know that 540^2 is 291600, because 54^2 is 2916, so 540^2 is 291600. So R = 540.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of f(\u03b8) is 540.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So f(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. The maximum of a cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8 is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So yes, that would be 540.\n\nSo the largest possible real part is 540.\n\nWait a second, but let me check the steps again because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic.\n\nCompute 324\u00b2:\n\n324 * 324: Let's compute 300*300=90000, 300*24=7200, 24*300=7200, 24*24=576.\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Actually, 324*324:\n\nBreak it down as (300 + 24)^2 = 300\u00b2 + 2*300*24 + 24\u00b2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 = 104400; 104400 + 576 = 104976. Correct.\n\n432\u00b2: 432 * 432.\n\nLet me compute 400*400 = 160000, 400*32 = 12800, 32*400=12800, 32*32=1024.\n\nWait, no, that's not the way. 432^2 = (400 + 32)^2 = 400\u00b2 + 2*400*32 + 32\u00b2 = 160000 + 25600 + 1024.\n\n160000 + 25600 = 185600; 185600 + 1024 = 186624. Correct.\n\nSo 324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2 = 104976 + 186624 = 291600.\n\nsqrt(291600) = 540. Correct.\n\nSo the maximum real part is 540. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, so the expression was (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z, with |z|=4.\n\nI set z=4 e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z = (1/4) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nThen, (75+117i)*4 e^{i\u03b8} = (300 + 468i) e^{i\u03b8}.\n\n(96+144i)/(4 e^{i\u03b8}) = (24 + 36i) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo the real part becomes Re[(300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)] + Re[(24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8)].\n\nWhich is Re[300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8 + i(300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8)] + Re[24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8 + i(-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8)].\n\nTaking the real parts:\n\n= (300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8) + (24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8)\n\n= (300 +24) cos\u03b8 + (-468 +36) sin\u03b8\n\n= 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, yes, the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nWhich is a linear combination of cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8, so its maximum is sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540.\n\nSo the maximum real part is 540.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 540.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this complex number problem to solve. The question is asking for the largest possible real part of the expression \\[(75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\], where \\( z \\) is a complex number with \\( |z| = 4 \\). Hmm, that's interesting. I need to find the maximum real part of this expression. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that any complex number \\( z \\) can be written in polar form. Since the modulus of \\( z \\) is given as 4, I can express \\( z \\) as \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), where \\( \\theta \\) is the argument of \\( z \\). That might make things easier to handle because dealing with exponents could simplify the expression.\n\nSo, substituting \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\) into the expression, the first term becomes \\( (75 + 117i) \\times 4e^{i\\theta} \\). The second term is \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}} \\). Let me compute each part separately.\n\nLet me compute the first term first: \\( (75 + 117i) \\times 4e^{i\\theta} \\). Multiplying the scalar 4 with the complex number \\( 75 + 117i \\) gives \\( 300 + 468i \\). So, the first term is \\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} \\).\n\nNow, the second term: \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}} \\). Dividing 96 by 4 gives 24, and 144 by 4 is 36. So, that simplifies to \\( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\) because dividing by \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) is the same as multiplying by \\( e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nSo now, the entire expression becomes:\n\\[ (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\]\n\nI need to find the real part of this expression. To do that, I'll expand each term using Euler's formula, which states that \\( e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta \\) and \\( e^{-i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst, expand \\( (300 + 468i)(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta) \\):\n- Multiply 300 by \\( \\cos\\theta \\): \\( 300\\cos\\theta \\)\n- Multiply 300 by \\( i\\sin\\theta \\): \\( 300i\\sin\\theta \\)\n- Multiply 468i by \\( \\cos\\theta \\): \\( 468i\\cos\\theta \\)\n- Multiply 468i by \\( i\\sin\\theta \\): \\( 468i^2\\sin\\theta = -468\\sin\\theta \\) (since \\( i^2 = -1 \\))\n\nSo, combining these, the first part is:\n\\[ (300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta) + i(300\\sin\\theta + 468\\cos\\theta) \\]\n\nSimilarly, expand \\( (24 + 36i)(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta) \\):\n- Multiply 24 by \\( \\cos\\theta \\): \\( 24\\cos\\theta \\)\n- Multiply 24 by \\( -i\\sin\\theta \\): \\( -24i\\sin\\theta \\)\n- Multiply 36i by \\( \\cos\\theta \\): \\( 36i\\cos\\theta \\)\n- Multiply 36i by \\( -i\\sin\\theta \\): \\( -36i^2\\sin\\theta = 36\\sin\\theta \\) (since \\( i^2 = -1 \\))\n\nSo, the second part is:\n\\[ (24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta) + i(-24\\sin\\theta + 36\\cos\\theta) \\]\n\nNow, adding the two expanded terms together:\n\nReal parts:\n- From the first term: \\( 300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta \\)\n- From the second term: \\( 24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta \\)\nTotal real part: \\( (300 + 24)\\cos\\theta + (-468 + 36)\\sin\\theta = 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\)\n\nImaginary parts:\n- From the first term: \\( 300\\sin\\theta + 468\\cos\\theta \\)\n- From the second term: \\( -24\\sin\\theta + 36\\cos\\theta \\)\nTotal imaginary part: \\( (300 - 24)\\sin\\theta + (468 + 36)\\cos\\theta = 276\\sin\\theta + 504\\cos\\theta \\)\n\nBut since we're only interested in the real part of the entire expression, we can focus on the real part, which is \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nSo, our goal is to maximize \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\). Hmm, this looks like a linear combination of sine and cosine, which can be expressed as a single sinusoidal function. I remember that expressions of the form \\( A\\cos\\theta + B\\sin\\theta \\) can be rewritten as \\( R\\cos(\\theta + \\phi) \\) or \\( R\\sin(\\theta + \\phi) \\), where \\( R = \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \\) and \\( \\phi \\) is some phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is \\( R \\), since the maximum of cosine and sine functions is 1.\n\nIn this case, our expression is \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\). So, \\( A = 324 \\) and \\( B = -432 \\). Let me compute \\( R \\):\n\n\\( R = \\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \\)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n\\( 324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104976 \\)\n\n\\( (-432)^2 = 432^2 \\).

So, (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160000 + 25600 + 1024.\n\nAdding them up: 160000 + 25600 = 185600; 185600 + 1024 = 186624.\n\nSo, \\( R = \\sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \\sqrt{291600} \\). Hmm, what's the square root of 291600? Let me compute:\n\nI know that 500^2 = 250000, 600^2 = 360000. So, between 500 and 600. Let's try 540: 540^2 = 291600. Exactly! So, R = 540.\n\nTherefore, \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta = 540\\cos(\\theta + \\phi) \\), where \\( \\phi \\) is some angle. The maximum value of this expression is 540, which occurs when \\( \\cos(\\theta + \\phi) = 1 \\), i.e., when \\( \\theta + \\phi = 2k\\pi \\) for some integer k.\n\nSo, the maximum real part of the given expression is 540. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the computation of \\( R \\):\n\n\\( A = 324, B = -432 \\)\n\\( R = \\sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} \\)\n\nWait, 324^2 is 104976, 432^2 is 186624. Adding them gives 291600, whose square root is 540. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is by letting \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), then \\( 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\\theta} \\). So, the expression becomes:\n\n\\( (75 + 117i) \\times 4e^{i\\theta} + (96 + 144i) \\times \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta} \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( [4(75 + 117i)]e^{i\\theta} + [(96 + 144i)/4]e^{-i\\theta} \\)\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\)\n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to represent \\( z \\) as \\( 4e^{i\\theta} \\) and then express the entire expression in terms of \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) and \\( e^{-i\\theta} \\). Then, the real part is the sum of the real parts of each term, which I have already calculated.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps using vectors or inner products to find the maximum. Since the expression is a linear combination of \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) and \\( e^{-i\\theta} \\), the real part can be written as the dot product of two vectors. Hmm, but I think the method I used earlier is solid.\n\nLet me also think about whether I can write the expression as a single sinusoid. So, as I did, the real part is \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\), which is equivalent to \\( R \\cos(\\theta + \\phi) \\), and the maximum is R. So that should give me the maximum real part.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I should compute the derivative and find the maximum. But that might be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Let me think: The expression \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\) can be considered as the dot product of vectors (324, -432) and (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8). The maximum value of the dot product is the product of their magnitudes, which is sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) * sqrt(cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8) = R * 1 = R = 540. So that also confirms that the maximum is 540.\n\nTherefore, I think I can be confident that the largest possible real part is 540.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this complex number problem to solve. The question is asking for the largest possible real part of the expression \\[(75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\], where \\( z \\) is a complex number with \\( |z| = 4 \\). Hmm, that's interesting. I need to find the maximum real part of this expression. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that any complex number \\( z \\) can be written in polar form. Since the modulus of \\( z \\) is given as 4, I can express \\( z \\) as \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), where \\( \\theta \\) is the argument of \\( z \\). That might make things easier to handle because dealing with exponents could simplify the expression.\n\nSo, substituting \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\) into the expression, the first term becomes \\( (75 + 117i) \\times 4e^{i\\theta} \\). The second term is \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}} \\). Let me compute each part separately.\n\nLet me compute the first term first: \\( (75 + 117i) \\times 4e^{i\\theta} \\). Multiplying the scalar 4 with the complex number \\( 75 + 117i \\) gives \\( 300 + 468i \\). So, the first term is \\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} \\).\n\nNow, the second term: \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}} \\). Dividing 96 by 4 gives 24, and 144 by 4 is 36. So, that simplifies to \\( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\) because dividing by \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) is the same as multiplying by \\( e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nSo now, the entire expression becomes:\n\\[ (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\]\n\nI need to find the real part of this expression. To do that, I'll expand each term using Euler's formula, which states that \\( e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta \\) and \\( e^{-i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst, expand \\( (300 + 468i)(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta) \\):\n- Multiply 300 by \\( \\cos\\theta \\): \\( 300\\cos\\theta \\)\n- Multiply 300 by \\( i\\sin\\theta \\): \\( 300i\\sin\\theta \\)\n- Multiply 468i by \\( \\cos\\theta \\): \\( 468i\\cos\\theta \\)\n- Multiply 468i by \\( i\\sin\\theta \\): \\( 468i^2\\sin\\theta = -468\\sin\\theta \\) (since \\( i^2 = -1 \\))\n\nSo, combining these, the first part is:\n\\[ (300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta) + i(300\\sin\\theta + 468\\cos\\theta) \\]\n\nSimilarly, expand \\( (24 + 36i)(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta) \\):\n- Multiply 24 by \\( \\cos\\theta \\): \\( 24\\cos\\theta \\)\n- Multiply 24 by \\( -i\\sin\\theta \\): \\( -24i\\sin\\theta \\)\n- Multiply 36i by \\( \\cos\\theta \\): \\( 36i\\cos\\theta \\)\n- Multiply 36i by \\( -i\\sin\\theta \\): \\( -36i^2\\sin\\theta = 36\\sin\\theta \\) (since \\( i^2 = -1 \\))\n\nSo, the second part is:\n\\[ (24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta) + i(-24\\sin\\theta + 36\\cos\\theta) \\]\n\nNow, adding the two expanded terms together:\n\nReal parts:\n- From the first term: \\( 300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta \\)\n- From the second term: \\( 24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta \\)\nTotal real part: \\( (300 + 24)\\cos\\theta + (-468 + 36)\\sin\\theta = 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\)\n\nImaginary parts:\n- From the first term: \\( 300\\sin\\theta + 468\\cos\\theta \\)\n- From the second term: \\( -24\\sin\\theta + 36\\cos\\theta \\)\nTotal imaginary part: \\( (300 - 24)\\sin\\theta + (468 + 36)\\cos\\theta = 276\\sin\\theta + 504\\cos\\theta \\)\n\nBut since we're only interested in the real part of the entire expression, we can focus on the real part, which is \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nSo, our goal is to maximize \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\). Hmm, this looks like a linear combination of sine and cosine, which can be expressed as a single sinusoidal function. I remember that expressions of the form \\( A\\cos\\theta + B\\sin\\theta \\) can be rewritten as \\( R\\cos(\\theta + \\phi) \\) or \\( R\\sin(\\theta + \\phi) \\), where \\( R = \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \\) and \\( \\phi \\) is some phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is \\( R \\), since the maximum of cosine and sine functions is 1.\n\nIn this case, our expression is \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\). So, \\( A = 324 \\) and \\( B = -432 \\). Let me compute \\( R \\):\n\n\\( R = \\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \\)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n\\( 324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104976 \\)\n\n\\( (-432)^2 = 432^2 \\). Let's compute 432 squared:\n\n432 * 432: Let's compute 400^2 = 160000, 32^2=1024, and cross terms 2*400*32=25600.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, 432 is 400 + 32. So, (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160000 + 25600 + 1024.\n\nAdding them up: 160000 + 25600 = 185600; 185600 + 1024 = 186624.\n\nSo, \\( R = \\sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \\sqrt{291600} \\). Hmm, what's the square root of 291600? Let me compute:\n\nI know that 500^2 = 250000, 600^2 = 360000. So, between 500 and 600. Let's try 540: 540^2 = 291600. Exactly! So, R = 540.\n\nTherefore, \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta = 540\\cos(\\theta + \\phi) \\), where \\( \\phi \\) is some angle. The maximum value of this expression is 540, which occurs when \\( \\cos(\\theta + \\phi) = 1 \\), i.e., when \\( \\theta + \\phi = 2k\\pi \\) for some integer k.\n\nSo, the maximum real part of the given expression is 540. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the computation of \\( R \\):\n\n\\( A = 324, B = -432 \\)\n\\( R = \\sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} \\)\n\nWait, 324^2 is 104976, 432^2 is 186624. Adding them gives 291600, whose square root is 540. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is by letting \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), then \\( 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\\theta} \\). So, the expression becomes:\n\n\\( (75 + 117i) \\times 4e^{i\\theta} + (96 + 144i) \\times \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta} \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( [4(75 + 117i)]e^{i\\theta} + [(96 + 144i)/4]e^{-i\\theta} \\)\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\)\n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that any complex number z with a fixed modulus can be expressed in polar form. Since |z| = 4, I can write z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. That might make things easier because then I can express everything in terms of \u03b8, which is a single variable. So, let's start by substituting z = 4e^{i\u03b8}.\n\nThen, the expression becomes (75 + 117i)(4e^{i\u03b8}) + (96 + 144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8}). Let me compute each part separately.\n\nFirst part: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8} = 4*(75 + 117i) * e^{i\u03b8}. Let me compute 4*(75 + 117i). 4*75 is 300, and 4*117 is 468. So that becomes 300 + 468i. So the first term is (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8}.\n\nSecond part: (96 + 144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8}) = (96 + 144i)/(4) * e^{-i\u03b8} because 1/e^{i\u03b8} = e^{-i\u03b8}. So 96/4 is 24, and 144/4 is 36. So that becomes (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo now the entire expression is (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, I need to compute the real part of this expression. Let me think about how to find the real part of a complex number. Remember that for any complex number a + bi, the real part is a. So, I need to compute the real parts of each term and add them together.\n\nBut these terms are in exponential form. Maybe it's easier to convert them into rectangular form using Euler's formula. Euler's formula says that e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8, and e^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, let's compute each part:\n\nFirst term: (300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). Let's multiply this out.\n\n300*(cos\u03b8) + 300*(i sin\u03b8) + 468i*(cos\u03b8) + 468i*(i sin\u03b8).\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n300 cos\u03b8 + 300i sin\u03b8 + 468i cos\u03b8 + 468i\u00b2 sin\u03b8.\n\nSince i\u00b2 = -1, the last term becomes -468 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, combining like terms:\n\nReal parts: 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary parts: (300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8) i.\n\nSo the first term has real part 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8.\n\nSecond term: (24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8). Let's expand this as well.\n\n24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 - 36i\u00b2 sin\u03b8.\n\nAgain, i\u00b2 is -1, so the last term is +36 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, expanding:\n\n24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8.\n\nReal parts: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary parts: (-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8) i.\n\nSo the second term's real part is 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8.\n\nNow, the entire expression's real part is the sum of the real parts of the two terms:\n\n[300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8] + [24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8].\n\nLet me combine like terms:\n\ncos\u03b8 terms: 300 + 24 = 324.\n\nsin\u03b8 terms: -468 + 36 = -432.\n\nSo the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nHmm, so now the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 can be rewritten as C cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where C = sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), and \u03c6 is some angle. The maximum value of this expression is then C, since the maximum of cos is 1.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. So, A is 324 and B is -432.\n\nSo, let's compute C = sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)\u00b2).\n\nCompute 324 squared: 324 * 324. Let me compute that.\n\n324 * 300 = 97,200.\n\n324 * 24 = 7,776.\n\nSo total is 97,200 + 7,776 = 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, (-432) squared is 432\u00b2. Let me compute that.\n\n400\u00b2 = 160,000.\n\n32\u00b2 = 1,024.\n\nAnd 2*400*32 = 25,600.\n\nSo, (400 + 32)\u00b2 = 400\u00b2 + 2*400*32 + 32\u00b2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.\n\nSo, 432\u00b2 is 186,624.\n\nSo, C = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).\n\nWhat's sqrt(291,600)? Let me see.\n\nWell, 500\u00b2 is 250,000.\n\n540\u00b2 is 291,600. Because 500\u00b2 is 250,000, 40\u00b2 is 1,600, and 2*500*40 = 40,000. So, (500 + 40)\u00b2 = 540\u00b2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600.\n\nYes, so sqrt(291,600) = 540.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8 is 540.\n\nSo, the largest possible real part is 540.\n\nWait, let me just double-check that I didn't make a mistake in the signs. So, A is 324, B is -432. When we compute C, it's sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), which is sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2) regardless of the sign. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8 = R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is the amplitude, which is 540. So, the maximum value of this expression is indeed R, which is 540.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 540.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that any complex number z with a fixed modulus can be expressed in polar form. Since |z| = 4, I can write z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. That might make things easier because then I can express everything in terms of \u03b8, which is a single variable. So, let's start by substituting z = 4e^{i\u03b8}.\n\nThen, the expression becomes (75 + 117i)(4e^{i\u03b8}) + (96 + 144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8}). Let me compute each part separately.\n\nFirst part: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8} = 4*(75 + 117i) * e^{i\u03b8}. Let me compute 4*(75 + 117i). 4*75 is 300, and 4*117 is 468. So that becomes 300 + 468i. So the first term is (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8}.\n\nSecond part: (96 + 144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8}) = (96 + 144i)/(4) * e^{-i\u03b8} because 1/e^{i\u03b8} = e^{-i\u03b8}. So 96/4 is 24, and 144/4 is 36. So that becomes (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo now the entire expression is (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, I need to compute the real part of this expression. Let me think about how to find the real part of a complex number. Remember that for any complex number a + bi, the real part is a. So, I need to compute the real parts of each term and add them together.\n\nBut these terms are in exponential form. Maybe it's easier to convert them into rectangular form using Euler's formula. Euler's formula says that e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8, and e^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, let's compute each part:\n\nFirst term: (300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). Let's multiply this out.\n\n300*(cos\u03b8) + 300*(i sin\u03b8) + 468i*(cos\u03b8) + 468i*(i sin\u03b8).\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n300 cos\u03b8 + 300i sin\u03b8 + 468i cos\u03b8 + 468i\u00b2 sin\u03b8.\n\nSince i\u00b2 = -1, the last term becomes -468 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, combining like terms:\n\nReal parts: 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary parts: (300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8) i.\n\nSo the first term has real part 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8.\n\nSecond term: (24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8). Let's expand this as well.\n\n24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 - 36i\u00b2 sin\u03b8.\n\nAgain, i\u00b2 is -1, so the last term is +36 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, expanding:\n\n24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8.\n\nReal parts: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary parts: (-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8) i.\n\nSo the second term's real part is 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8.\n\nNow, the entire expression's real part is the sum of the real parts of the two terms:\n\n[300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8] + [24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8].\n\nLet me combine like terms:\n\ncos\u03b8 terms: 300 + 24 = 324.\n\nsin\u03b8 terms: -468 + 36 = -432.\n\nSo the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nHmm, so now the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 can be rewritten as C cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where C = sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), and \u03c6 is some angle. The maximum value of this expression is then C, since the maximum of cos is 1.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. So, A is 324 and B is -432.\n\nSo, let's compute C = sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)\u00b2).\n\nCompute 324 squared: 324 * 324. Let me compute that.\n\n324 * 300 = 97,200.\n\n324 * 24 = 7,776.\n\nSo total is 97,200 + 7,776 = 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, (-432) squared is 432\u00b2. Let me compute that.\n\n400\u00b2 = 160,000.\n\n32\u00b2 = 1,024.\n\nAnd 2*400*32 = 25,600.\n\nSo, (400 + 32)\u00b2 = 400\u00b2 + 2*400*32 + 32\u00b2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.\n\nSo, 432\u00b2 is 186,624.\n\nSo, C = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).\n\nWhat's sqrt(291,600)? Let me see.\n\nWell, 500\u00b2 is 250,000.\n\n540\u00b2 is 291,600. Because 500\u00b2 is 250,000, 40\u00b2 is 1,600, and 2*500*40 = 40,000. So, (500 + 40)\u00b2 = 540\u00b2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600.\n\nYes, so sqrt(291,600) = 540.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8 is 540.\n\nSo, the largest possible real part is 540.\n\nWait, let me just double-check that I didn't make a mistake in the signs. So, A is 324, B is -432. When we compute C, it's sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), which is sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2) regardless of the sign. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8 = R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is the amplitude, which is 540. So, the maximum value of this expression is indeed R, which is 540.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 540.\n\n\nTo find the largest possible real part of the expression \\((75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\) where \\(z\\) is a complex number with \\(|z| = 4\\), we start by expressing \\(z\\) in polar form as \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since z is a complex number with |z| = 4, that means z lies on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4 centered at the origin. So, z can be represented as z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. Alternatively, I can write z as 4(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). That might come in handy later.\n\nNow, the expression is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me think about how to handle this. Since z is in the denominator, maybe I can write the entire expression in terms of z and 1/z, but given that |z| = 4, I can relate 1/z to the conjugate of z. Because for any complex number z, 1/z is equal to the conjugate of z divided by |z|\u00b2. Since |z| is 4, |z|\u00b2 is 16. So, 1/z = conjugate(z)/16.\n\nWait, let me write that down more formally. If z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, then 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}, which is the same as (conjugate(z))/16 because conjugate(z) is 4e^{-i\u03b8}, so dividing by 16 gives (4e^{-i\u03b8})/16 = (e^{-i\u03b8})/4, which matches 1/z. So, yeah, 1/z = conjugate(z)/16.\n\nSo, perhaps I can rewrite the entire expression in terms of z and conjugate(z). Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote z as x + yi, but maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, using the exponential form might be better. Let me think.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me set w = z. Then, since |z|=4, |w|=4. So, 1/w = conjugate(w)/16. Therefore, the expression becomes:\n\n(75 + 117i)w + (96 + 144i)(conjugate(w))/16.\n\nHmm, that's an interesting form. So, the expression is a combination of w and conjugate(w), which are complex conjugates. Maybe I can express this as A w + B conjugate(w), where A and B are some complex constants.\n\nLet me compute A and B. A is (75 + 117i), and B is (96 + 144i)/16. Let me compute B:\n\n(96 + 144i)/16 = (96/16) + (144i)/16 = 6 + 9i. So, B is 6 + 9i.\n\nSo, the expression is A w + B conjugate(w), where A = 75 + 117i and B = 6 + 9i.\n\nNow, since w is a complex number with |w|=4, I can write w = 4e^{i\u03b8}. Then, conjugate(w) = 4e^{-i\u03b8}. So, substituting back into the expression:\n\nA w + B conjugate(w) = (75 + 117i)4e^{i\u03b8} + (6 + 9i)4e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nLet me factor out the 4:\n\n4[(75 + 117i)e^{i\u03b8} + (6 + 9i)e^{-i\u03b8}].\n\nHmm, so the expression simplifies to 4 times that sum. Let me compute each term separately.\n\nFirst, compute (75 + 117i)e^{i\u03b8}. Since e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8, so multiplying by 75 + 117i:\n\n(75 + 117i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) = 75 cos\u03b8 + 75 i sin\u03b8 + 117i cos\u03b8 + 117i^2 sin\u03b8.\n\nSince i^2 = -1, this becomes:\n\n75 cos\u03b8 + i(75 sin\u03b8 + 117 cos\u03b8) - 117 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, combining the real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: 75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary part: 75 sin\u03b8 + 117 cos\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, compute (6 + 9i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\ne^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, (6 + 9i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) = 6 cos\u03b8 - 6i sin\u03b8 + 9i cos\u03b8 - 9i^2 sin\u03b8.\n\nAgain, since i^2 = -1, this becomes:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 + i(9 cos\u03b8 -6 sin\u03b8) +9 sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, let me double-check that:\n\nWait, 9i cos\u03b8 is 9i cos\u03b8, and -9i^2 sin\u03b8 is -9(-1) sin\u03b8 = +9 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, expanding:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 -6i sin\u03b8 +9i cos\u03b8 +9 sin\u03b8.\n\nGrouping real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: 6 cos\u03b8 +9 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary part: (-6 sin\u03b8 +9 cos\u03b8).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression inside the brackets is:\n\n[ (75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8) + i(75 sin\u03b8 + 117 cos\u03b8) ] + [ (6 cos\u03b8 +9 sin\u03b8) + i(-6 sin\u03b8 +9 cos\u03b8) ].\n\nNow, let's add these together.\n\nFirst, add the real parts:\n\n(75 cos\u03b8 -117 sin\u03b8) + (6 cos\u03b8 +9 sin\u03b8) = (75 +6) cos\u03b8 + (-117 +9) sin\u03b8 = 81 cos\u03b8 -108 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary parts:\n\n(75 sin\u03b8 +117 cos\u03b8) + (-6 sin\u03b8 +9 cos\u03b8) = (75 -6) sin\u03b8 + (117 +9) cos\u03b8 = 69 sin\u03b8 + 126 cos\u03b8.\n\nSo, the expression inside the brackets becomes (81 cos\u03b8 -108 sin\u03b8) + i(69 sin\u03b8 +126 cos\u03b8). Then, we multiply by 4, so the entire expression is 4*(81 cos\u03b8 -108 sin\u03b8 + i(69 sin\u03b8 +126 cos\u03b8)).\n\nBut we are only interested in the real part of the entire expression. So, the real part is 4*(81 cos\u03b8 -108 sin\u03b8).\n\nSo, the real part is 4*(81 cos\u03b8 -108 sin\u03b8). Let me write that as 4*81 cos\u03b8 -4*108 sin\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8.\n\nNow, our goal is to find the maximum value of this expression, which is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, over all \u03b8.\n\nHmm, so we have an expression of the form A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, but in this case, it's 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. To find the maximum of this, we can use the formula that the maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2).\n\nWait, let me recall: the maximum value of C cos\u03b8 + D sin\u03b8 is sqrt(C\u00b2 + D\u00b2). So, in this case, C is 324, D is -432.\n\nSo, the maximum value is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)\u00b2).\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 324 squared:\n\n324 * 324. Let me compute 300\u00b2 = 90000, 24\u00b2=576, and cross term 2*300*24=14400. So, (300 +24)^2 = 90000 +14400 +576= 90000 +14400=104400 +576=104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432 squared:\n\n400\u00b2=160000, 32\u00b2=1024, cross term 2*400*32=25600.\n\nSo, (400 +32)^2= 160000 +25600 +1024= 160000+25600=185600 +1024=186,624.\n\nSo, 324\u00b2=104,976, and 432\u00b2=186,624. Since D is -432, D\u00b2 is still 186,624.\n\nSo, the sum is 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.\n\nSo, sqrt(291,600). Let's see, 540\u00b2=291,600 because 500\u00b2=250,000, 40\u00b2=1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000. So, (500+40)^2=500\u00b2 +2*500*40 +40\u00b2=250,000+40,000+1,600=291,600. So, sqrt(291,600)=540.\n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, but hold on. The expression we have is 4*(81 cos\u03b8 -108 sin\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, which we found has a maximum of 540. Therefore, the maximum real part of the original expression is 540.\n\nBut wait a second, let me double-check that. Because the expression we derived is the real part of the entire expression. So, yeah, 540 is the maximum value of the real part.\n\nIs there any chance I made a mistake in the calculations? Let me go through the steps again.\n\nWe had the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z, with |z|=4.\n\nExpressed z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, the expression becomes (75+117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} + (96+144i)*(1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Earlier, I wrote (96 +144i)/z as (96 +144i)*(1/z). But 1/z is (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}, so (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)*(1/4)e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nWait, but in my initial steps, I thought of it as (96 +144i)/16 times conjugate(z), which would be (96 +144i)/16 *4 e^{-i\u03b8} = (6 +9i) e^{-i\u03b8}. Wait, that's different from what I just said. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, 1/z = conjugate(z)/|z|\u00b2. Since |z|\u00b2 =16, so 1/z = conjugate(z)/16. So, (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)*(conjugate(z)/16) = (96 +144i)/16 * conjugate(z) = (6 +9i) conjugate(z).\n\nBut z is 4e^{i\u03b8}, so conjugate(z) is 4e^{-i\u03b8}. Therefore, (6 +9i) *4e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I thought of (96 +144i)/z as (96 +144i)/16 * conjugate(z). So, that's (6 +9i) * conjugate(z), which is (6 +9i)*4e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 +36i) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nBut in my first calculation, I wrote (96 +144i)/z as (96 +144i)/16 * conjugate(z), which is (6 +9i) * conjugate(z), which is (6 +9i)*4e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nBut when I first expanded the expression, I think I might have miscalculated the coefficient.\n\nWait, in the initial expansion, I think I may have made a mistake in the coefficients. Let me go back.\n\nWait, when I initially expressed (96 +144i)/z, I considered that as (96 +144i)/16 * conjugate(z), which is correct because 1/z = conjugate(z)/16. So, (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)/16 * conjugate(z) = (6 +9i)*conjugate(z). Since z is 4e^{i\u03b8}, conjugate(z) is 4e^{-i\u03b8}, so (6 +9i)*4e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nWait, but in the initial expansion, I think I treated it as (6 +9i) * conjugate(z) without the 4 factor. So, perhaps I made an error in the coefficients earlier.\n\nWait, let me redo the expansion correctly.\n\nSo, the expression is (75 +117i)z + (96 +144i)/z.\n\nExpress z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, so (75 +117i)z = (75 +117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8}.\n\nSimilarly, (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)*(1/z) = (96 +144i)*(1/(4e^{i\u03b8})) = (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, the entire expression is (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, when I expand these, I need to compute each term.\n\nFirst term: (300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) = 300 cos\u03b8 + 300 i sin\u03b8 +468i cos\u03b8 +468i^2 sin\u03b8.\n\nWhich simplifies to 300 cos\u03b8 + i(300 sin\u03b8 +468 cos\u03b8) -468 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, real part: 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary part: 300 sin\u03b8 +468 cos\u03b8.\n\nSecond term: (24 +36i)(cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8) =24 cos\u03b8 -24 i sin\u03b8 +36i cos\u03b8 -36i^2 sin\u03b8.\n\nSimplify: 24 cos\u03b8 + i(-24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8) +36 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, real part: 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary part: (-24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8).\n\nSo, adding both terms together:\n\nReal parts: (300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8) + (24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8) = (300 +24) cos\u03b8 + (-468 +36) sin\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary parts: (300 sin\u03b8 +468 cos\u03b8) + (-24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8) = (300 -24) sin\u03b8 + (468 +36) cos\u03b8 = 276 sin\u03b8 +504 cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, but the original expression is (300 +468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, the entire expression is [324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8] + i[276 sin\u03b8 +504 cos\u03b8].\n\nTherefore, the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, which is the same as before. So, the real part is indeed 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, and the maximum of that is 540, as I computed earlier.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I had (75 +117i)z + (96 +144i)/z, which I converted into (75 +117i)4e^{i\u03b8} + (96 +144i)(1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nWait, that would be (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}, which is what I just redid. So, the expansion seems correct.\n\nSo, the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, and the maximum is sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 324\u00b2 + (-432)^2 = 104976 + 186624 = 291600, whose square root is 540.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, which can be written as R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2) = 540, and \u03c6 is some phase shift. The maximum value of R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) is R, which is 540. So, the maximum real part is indeed 540.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible real part of the given expression is 540.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, let me verify that all steps are correct.\n\nWe started with the expression (75 +117i)z + (96 +144i)/z, with |z|=4.\n\nExpressed z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, (75 +117i)z = (75 +117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} = (300 +468i)e^{i\u03b8}.\n\n(96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)*(1/4)e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nExpanding both terms:\n\nFirst term: (300 +468i)(cos\u03b8 +i sin\u03b8) = 300 cos\u03b8 +300i sin\u03b8 +468i cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8.\n\nWhich gives real part: 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary part: 300 sin\u03b8 +468 cos\u03b8.\n\nSecond term: (24 +36i)(cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8) =24 cos\u03b8 -24i sin\u03b8 +36i cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8.\n\nWhich gives real part: 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary part: (-24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8).\n\nAdding real parts: 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8 +24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary parts: 300 sin\u03b8 +468 cos\u03b8 -24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8 = 276 sin\u03b8 +504 cos\u03b8.\n\nSo, real part is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8.\n\nExpressed as a single cosine function: R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R = sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2).\n\nCompute R: 324\u00b2 = 104,976; 432\u00b2 = 186,624.\n\nR = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600) = 540.\n\nHence, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nSo, I think all the steps are correct, and the answer is 540.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since z is a complex number with |z| = 4, that means z lies on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4 centered at the origin. So, z can be represented as z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. Alternatively, I can write z as 4(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). That might come in handy later.\n\nNow, the expression is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me think about how to handle this. Since z is in the denominator, maybe I can write the entire expression in terms of z and 1/z, but given that |z| = 4, I can relate 1/z to the conjugate of z. Because for any complex number z, 1/z is equal to the conjugate of z divided by |z|\u00b2. Since |z| is 4, |z|\u00b2 is 16. So, 1/z = conjugate(z)/16.\n\nWait, let me write that down more formally. If z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, then 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}, which is the same as (conjugate(z))/16 because conjugate(z) is 4e^{-i\u03b8}, so dividing by 16 gives (4e^{-i\u03b8})/16 = (e^{-i\u03b8})/4, which matches 1/z. So, yeah, 1/z = conjugate(z)/16.\n\nSo, perhaps I can rewrite the entire expression in terms of z and conjugate(z). Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote z as x + yi, but maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, using the exponential form might be better. Let me think.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me set w = z. Then, since |z|=4, |w|=4. So, 1/w = conjugate(w)/16. Therefore, the expression becomes:\n\n(75 + 117i)w + (96 + 144i)(conjugate(w))/16.\n\nHmm, that's an interesting form. So, the expression is a combination of w and conjugate(w), which are complex conjugates. Maybe I can express this as A w + B conjugate(w), where A and B are some complex constants.\n\nLet me compute A and B. A is (75 + 117i), and B is (96 + 144i)/16. Let me compute B:\n\n(96 + 144i)/16 = (96/16) + (144i)/16 = 6 + 9i. So, B is 6 + 9i.\n\nSo, the expression is A w + B conjugate(w), where A = 75 + 117i and B = 6 + 9i.\n\nNow, since w is a complex number with |w|=4, I can write w = 4e^{i\u03b8}. Then, conjugate(w) = 4e^{-i\u03b8}. So, substituting back into the expression:\n\nA w + B conjugate(w) = (75 + 117i)4e^{i\u03b8} + (6 + 9i)4e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nLet me factor out the 4:\n\n4[(75 + 117i)e^{i\u03b8} + (6 + 9i)e^{-i\u03b8}].\n\nHmm, so the expression simplifies to 4 times that sum. Let me compute each term separately.\n\nFirst, compute (75 + 117i)e^{i\u03b8}. Since e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8, so multiplying by 75 + 117i:\n\n(75 + 117i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) = 75 cos\u03b8 + 75 i sin\u03b8 + 117i cos\u03b8 + 117i^2 sin\u03b8.\n\nSince i^2 = -1, this becomes:\n\n75 cos\u03b8 + i(75 sin\u03b8 + 117 cos\u03b8) - 117 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, combining the real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: 75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary part: 75 sin\u03b8 + 117 cos\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, compute (6 + 9i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\ne^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, (6 + 9i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) = 6 cos\u03b8 - 6i sin\u03b8 + 9i cos\u03b8 - 9i^2 sin\u03b8.\n\nAgain, since i^2 = -1, this becomes:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 + i(9 cos\u03b8 -6 sin\u03b8) +9 sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, let me double-check that:\n\nWait, 9i cos\u03b8 is 9i cos\u03b8, and -9i^2 sin\u03b8 is -9(-1) sin\u03b8 = +9 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, expanding:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 -6i sin\u03b8 +9i cos\u03b8 +9 sin\u03b8.\n\nGrouping real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: 6 cos\u03b8 +9 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary part: (-6 sin\u03b8 +9 cos\u03b8).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression inside the brackets is:\n\n[ (75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8) + i(75 sin\u03b8 + 117 cos\u03b8) ] + [ (6 cos\u03b8 +9 sin\u03b8) + i(-6 sin\u03b8 +9 cos\u03b8) ].\n\nNow, let's add these together.\n\nFirst, add the real parts:\n\n(75 cos\u03b8 -117 sin\u03b8) + (6 cos\u03b8 +9 sin\u03b8) = (75 +6) cos\u03b8 + (-117 +9) sin\u03b8 = 81 cos\u03b8 -108 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary parts:\n\n(75 sin\u03b8 +117 cos\u03b8) + (-6 sin\u03b8 +9 cos\u03b8) = (75 -6) sin\u03b8 + (117 +9) cos\u03b8 = 69 sin\u03b8 + 126 cos\u03b8.\n\nSo, the expression inside the brackets becomes (81 cos\u03b8 -108 sin\u03b8) + i(69 sin\u03b8 +126 cos\u03b8). Then, we multiply by 4, so the entire expression is 4*(81 cos\u03b8 -108 sin\u03b8 + i(69 sin\u03b8 +126 cos\u03b8)).\n\nBut we are only interested in the real part of the entire expression. So, the real part is 4*(81 cos\u03b8 -108 sin\u03b8).\n\nSo, the real part is 4*(81 cos\u03b8 -108 sin\u03b8). Let me write that as 4*81 cos\u03b8 -4*108 sin\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8.\n\nNow, our goal is to find the maximum value of this expression, which is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, over all \u03b8.\n\nHmm, so we have an expression of the form A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, but in this case, it's 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. To find the maximum of this, we can use the formula that the maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2).\n\nWait, let me recall: the maximum value of C cos\u03b8 + D sin\u03b8 is sqrt(C\u00b2 + D\u00b2). So, in this case, C is 324, D is -432.\n\nSo, the maximum value is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)\u00b2).\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 324 squared:\n\n324 * 324. Let me compute 300\u00b2 = 90000, 24\u00b2=576, and cross term 2*300*24=14400. So, (300 +24)^2 = 90000 +14400 +576= 90000 +14400=104400 +576=104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432 squared:\n\n400\u00b2=160000, 32\u00b2=1024, cross term 2*400*32=25600.\n\nSo, (400 +32)^2= 160000 +25600 +1024= 160000+25600=185600 +1024=186,624.\n\nSo, 324\u00b2=104,976, and 432\u00b2=186,624. Since D is -432, D\u00b2 is still 186,624.\n\nSo, the sum is 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.\n\nSo, sqrt(291,600). Let's see, 540\u00b2=291,600 because 500\u00b2=250,000, 40\u00b2=1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000. So, (500+40)^2=500\u00b2 +2*500*40 +40\u00b2=250,000+40,000+1,600=291,600. So, sqrt(291,600)=540.\n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, but hold on. The expression we have is 4*(81 cos\u03b8 -108 sin\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, which we found has a maximum of 540. Therefore, the maximum real part of the original expression is 540.\n\nBut wait a second, let me double-check that. Because the expression we derived is the real part of the entire expression. So, yeah, 540 is the maximum value of the real part.\n\nIs there any chance I made a mistake in the calculations? Let me go through the steps again.\n\nWe had the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z, with |z|=4.\n\nExpressed z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, the expression becomes (75+117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} + (96+144i)*(1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Earlier, I wrote (96 +144i)/z as (96 +144i)*(1/z). But 1/z is (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}, so (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)*(1/4)e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nWait, but in my initial steps, I thought of it as (96 +144i)/16 times conjugate(z), which would be (96 +144i)/16 *4 e^{-i\u03b8} = (6 +9i) e^{-i\u03b8}. Wait, that's different from what I just said. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, 1/z = conjugate(z)/|z|\u00b2. Since |z|\u00b2 =16, so 1/z = conjugate(z)/16. So, (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)*(conjugate(z)/16) = (96 +144i)/16 * conjugate(z) = (6 +9i) conjugate(z).\n\nBut z is 4e^{i\u03b8}, so conjugate(z) is 4e^{-i\u03b8}. Therefore, (6 +9i) *4e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I thought of (96 +144i)/z as (96 +144i)/16 * conjugate(z). So, that's (6 +9i) * conjugate(z), which is (6 +9i)*4e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 +36i) e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nBut in my first calculation, I wrote (96 +144i)/z as (96 +144i)/16 * conjugate(z), which is (6 +9i) * conjugate(z), which is (6 +9i)*4e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nBut when I first expanded the expression, I think I might have miscalculated the coefficient.\n\nWait, in the initial expansion, I think I may have made a mistake in the coefficients. Let me go back.\n\nWait, when I initially expressed (96 +144i)/z, I considered that as (96 +144i)/16 * conjugate(z), which is correct because 1/z = conjugate(z)/16. So, (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)/16 * conjugate(z) = (6 +9i)*conjugate(z). Since z is 4e^{i\u03b8}, conjugate(z) is 4e^{-i\u03b8}, so (6 +9i)*4e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nWait, but in the initial expansion, I think I treated it as (6 +9i) * conjugate(z) without the 4 factor. So, perhaps I made an error in the coefficients earlier.\n\nWait, let me redo the expansion correctly.\n\nSo, the expression is (75 +117i)z + (96 +144i)/z.\n\nExpress z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, so (75 +117i)z = (75 +117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8}.\n\nSimilarly, (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)*(1/z) = (96 +144i)*(1/(4e^{i\u03b8})) = (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, the entire expression is (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, when I expand these, I need to compute each term.\n\nFirst term: (300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) = 300 cos\u03b8 + 300 i sin\u03b8 +468i cos\u03b8 +468i^2 sin\u03b8.\n\nWhich simplifies to 300 cos\u03b8 + i(300 sin\u03b8 +468 cos\u03b8) -468 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, real part: 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary part: 300 sin\u03b8 +468 cos\u03b8.\n\nSecond term: (24 +36i)(cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8) =24 cos\u03b8 -24 i sin\u03b8 +36i cos\u03b8 -36i^2 sin\u03b8.\n\nSimplify: 24 cos\u03b8 + i(-24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8) +36 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, real part: 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary part: (-24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8).\n\nSo, adding both terms together:\n\nReal parts: (300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8) + (24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8) = (300 +24) cos\u03b8 + (-468 +36) sin\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary parts: (300 sin\u03b8 +468 cos\u03b8) + (-24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8) = (300 -24) sin\u03b8 + (468 +36) cos\u03b8 = 276 sin\u03b8 +504 cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, but the original expression is (300 +468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, the entire expression is [324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8] + i[276 sin\u03b8 +504 cos\u03b8].\n\nTherefore, the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, which is the same as before. So, the real part is indeed 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, and the maximum of that is 540, as I computed earlier.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I had (75 +117i)z + (96 +144i)/z, which I converted into (75 +117i)4e^{i\u03b8} + (96 +144i)(1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nWait, that would be (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}, which is what I just redid. So, the expansion seems correct.\n\nSo, the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, and the maximum is sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 324\u00b2 + (-432)^2 = 104976 + 186624 = 291600, whose square root is 540.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, which can be written as R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2) = 540, and \u03c6 is some phase shift. The maximum value of R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) is R, which is 540. So, the maximum real part is indeed 540.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible real part of the given expression is 540.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, let me verify that all steps are correct.\n\nWe started with the expression (75 +117i)z + (96 +144i)/z, with |z|=4.\n\nExpressed z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nSo, (75 +117i)z = (75 +117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} = (300 +468i)e^{i\u03b8}.\n\n(96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)*(1/4)e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nExpanding both terms:\n\nFirst term: (300 +468i)(cos\u03b8 +i sin\u03b8) = 300 cos\u03b8 +300i sin\u03b8 +468i cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8.\n\nWhich gives real part: 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary part: 300 sin\u03b8 +468 cos\u03b8.\n\nSecond term: (24 +36i)(cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8) =24 cos\u03b8 -24i sin\u03b8 +36i cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8.\n\nWhich gives real part: 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary part: (-24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8).\n\nAdding real parts: 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8 +24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary parts: 300 sin\u03b8 +468 cos\u03b8 -24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8 = 276 sin\u03b8 +504 cos\u03b8.\n\nSo, real part is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8.\n\nExpressed as a single cosine function: R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R = sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2).\n\nCompute R: 324\u00b2 = 104,976; 432\u00b2 = 186,624.\n\nR = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600) = 540.\n\nHence, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nSo, I think all the steps are correct, and the answer is 540.\n\n\nTo find the largest possible real part of the expression \\[(75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\] where \\(z\\) is a complex number with \\(|z| = 4\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Express \\(z\\) in exponential form**: Since \\(|z| = 4\\), let \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is the argument of \\(z\\). Then, \\(\\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta}\\).\n\n2. **Rewrite the expression**: Substitute \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta}\\) into the original expression:\n   \\[\n   (75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i)4e^{i\\theta} + (96 + 144i)\\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta}.\n   \\]\n   Simplify the coefficients:\n   \\[\n   = (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expand each term**:\n   - For \\((300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta}\\):\n     \\[\n     = 300\\cos\\theta + 300i\\sin\\theta + 468i\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta.\n     \\]\n     Real part: \\(300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta\\).\n     Imaginary part: \\(300\\sin\\theta + 468\\cos\\theta\\).\n   - For \\((24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\\):\n     \\[\n     = 24\\cos\\theta - 24i\\sin\\theta + 36i\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta.\n     \\]\n     Real part: \\(24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta\\).\n     Imaginary part: \\(-24\\sin\\theta + 36\\cos\\theta\\).\n\n4. **Combine real and imaginary parts**:\n   - Real parts: \\(300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta + 24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta = 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta\\).\n   - Imaginary parts: \\(300\\sin\\theta + 468\\cos\\theta - 24\\sin\\theta + 36\\cos\\theta = 276\\sin\\theta + 504\\cos\\theta\\).\n\n5. **Focus on the real part**: The real part of the expression is \\(324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta\\). To find its maximum value, recognize that expressions of the form \\(A\\cos\\theta + B\\sin\\theta\\) have a maximum of \\(\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\\).\n\n6. **Compute the maximum**:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \\sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \\sqrt{291600} = 540.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the largest possible real part of the given expression is \\(\\boxed{540}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this complex math problem here, and I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \\[(75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\], where \\( z \\) is a complex number with \\( |z| = 4 \\). Hmm, alright, let me try to unpack this.\n\nFirst, I remember that any complex number \\( z \\) can be written in the form \\( z = re^{i\\theta} \\), where \\( r \\) is the modulus (or absolute value) of \\( z \\), and \\( \\theta \\) is the argument (or angle). In this case, \\( |z| = 4 \\), so \\( r = 4 \\). That means \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), right?\n\nSo, substituting \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\) into the expression, let me rewrite the entire thing. The first term is \\( (75 + 117i)z \\), which becomes \\( (75 + 117i) \\times 4e^{i\\theta} \\). The second term is \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{z} \\), which is \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}} \\).\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nStarting with the first term:\n\n\\( (75 + 117i) \\times 4e^{i\\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} \\).\n\nI can compute the scalar multiplication first: 4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i. So the first term simplifies to \\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} \\).\n\nNow, the second term:\n\n\\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}} = \\frac{96 + 144i}{4} \\times e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nDividing 96 + 144i by 4 gives 24 + 36i. So the second term is \\( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nSo putting it all together, the entire expression is:\n\n\\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nHmm, now I need to compute the real part of this expression. Let's denote \\( A = 300 + 468i \\) and \\( B = 24 + 36i \\). So the expression becomes \\( A e^{i\\theta} + B e^{-i\\theta} \\). \n\nI remember that for complex numbers, \\( e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta \\) and \\( e^{-i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta \\). So I can express each term as a product of the complex numbers and these exponentials.\n\nLet me compute \\( A e^{i\\theta} \\):\n\n\\( (300 + 468i)(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta) \\).\n\nExpanding this, I get:\n\n300\\cos\\theta + 300i\\sin\\theta + 468i\\cos\\theta + 468i^2\\sin\\theta.\n\nSince \\( i^2 = -1 \\), this becomes:\n\n300\\cos\\theta + 300i\\sin\\theta + 468i\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta.\n\nNow, grouping the real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: 300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta.\n\nImaginary part: 300\\sin\\theta + 468\\cos\\theta.\n\nSimilarly, for \\( B e^{-i\\theta} \\):\n\n\\( (24 + 36i)(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta) \\).\n\nExpanding:\n\n24\\cos\\theta - 24i\\sin\\theta + 36i\\cos\\theta - 36i^2\\sin\\theta.\n\nAgain, \\( i^2 = -1 \\), so:\n\n24\\cos\\theta - 24i\\sin\\theta + 36i\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta.\n\nGrouping real and imaginary:\n\nReal part: 24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta.\n\nImaginary part: (-24\\sin\\theta + 36\\cos\\theta)i.\n\nSo, adding both \\( A e^{i\\theta} \\) and \\( B e^{-i\\theta} \\), the total real part is:\n\n[300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta] + [24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta].\n\nSimplify this:\n\n(300 + 24)\\cos\\theta + (-468 + 36)\\sin\\theta.\n\nWhich is:\n\n324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part would be:\n\n[300\\sin\\theta + 468\\cos\\theta] + [-24\\sin\\theta + 36\\cos\\theta].\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(300 - 24)\\sin\\theta + (468 + 36)\\cos\\theta.\n\nBut since we're only interested in the real part, we can focus on \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nSo, the real part is \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\). Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression as \\( \\theta \\) varies.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form \\( a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta \\) can be rewritten as \\( R\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\), where \\( R = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\) and \\( \\phi = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right) \\) or something like that. So, perhaps I can express \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\) in this form.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's \\( a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta \\), but with a negative sign on the sine term. So, it's \\( a\\cos\\theta - b\\sin\\theta \\). Let me write it as \\( a\\cos\\theta + (-b)\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nSo, using the formula, the amplitude \\( R \\) would be \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + (-b)^2} = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\).\n\nSo, for our case, \\( a = 324 \\), \\( b = 432 \\).\n\nCalculating \\( R \\):\n\n\\( R = \\sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} \\).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n324 squared is... 324*324. Hmm, 300^2 is 90,000, 24^2 is 576, and cross terms are 2*300*24=14,400. So, 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.\n\nWait, wait, actually, 324^2: I think that's 104,976. Let me confirm: 300^2=90,000, 24^2=576, and 2*300*24=14,400. So, (300+24)^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432^2: 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, and 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400+32)^2=160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024=186,624.\n\nSo, R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).\n\nWhat is sqrt(291,600)? Let's see: 540^2 is 291,600 because 500^2=250,000, 40^2=1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000, so (500+40)^2=250,000 +40,000 +1,600=291,600. So, R=540.\n\nSo, the expression \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\) can be written as \\( 540\\cos(\\theta + \\phi) \\) or something similar. Wait, actually, the formula is \\( a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = R\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\), where \\( R = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\) and \\( \\phi = \\arctan(b/a) \\). But in our case, it's \\( a\\cos\\theta - b\\sin\\theta \\), which is equivalent to \\( a\\cos\\theta + (-b)\\sin\\theta \\). So, the amplitude is still R=540, but the phase angle \\( \\phi \\) would be \\( \\arctan((-b)/a) = \\arctan(-432/324) \\).\n\nWait, 432 divided by 324: let's simplify that. Both are divisible by 108. 432 \u00f7 108 = 4, 324 \u00f7 108=3. So, 432/324 = 4/3. So, it's -4/3. So, \\( \\phi = \\arctan(-4/3) \\).\n\nBut since we have a negative inside the arctangent, that would place \\( \\phi \\) in the fourth quadrant, but for the purposes of the formula, perhaps we can take it as a positive angle. Alternatively, maybe we can write it as \\( \\arctan(4/3) \\) but adjust the angle accordingly.\n\nBut regardless, the maximum value of \\( R\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\) is just R, since the maximum of cosine is 1. So, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me make sure.\n\nBecause the expression is \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\), which is \\( 540\\cos(\\theta + \\phi) \\) where \\( \\phi \\) is such that \\( \\cos\\phi = 324/540 \\) and \\( \\sin\\phi = 432/540 \\). Wait, actually, let me think again.\n\nWait, the general formula is \\( a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = R\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\), where \\( R = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\), and \\( \\cos\\phi = a/R \\), \\( \\sin\\phi = b/R \\).\n\nIn our case, the expression is \\( a\\cos\\theta + (-b)\\sin\\theta \\), so it's equivalent to \\( a\\cos\\theta + c\\sin\\theta \\) where c = -b. So, \\( R = \\sqrt{a^2 + c^2} = \\sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = 540 \\).\n\nAnd \\( \\cos\\phi = a/R = 324/540 \\), \\( \\sin\\phi = c/R = (-432)/540 = -4/5.\n\nWait, 324/540 simplifies. Both are divisible by 108: 324 \u00f7108=3, 540 \u00f7108=5. So, 3/5.\n\nSimilarly, 432/540: 432 \u00f7108=4, 540 \u00f7108=5. So, 4/5. But since c is negative, it's -4/5.\n\nSo, \\( \\cos\\phi = 3/5 \\) and \\( \\sin\\phi = -4/5 \\). So, \\( \\phi \\) is in the fourth quadrant, with reference angle \\( \\arctan(4/3) \\). So, the angle is \\( -\\arctan(4/3) \\) or \\( 2\\pi - \\arctan(4/3) \\).\n\nBut regardless of the exact value of \\( \\phi \\), the maximum value of \\( R\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\) is R, since the maximum of cosine is 1. So, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, but I should verify this. Let me think again. Because sometimes when you have expressions like \\( a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta \\), the maximum is R, but in our case, the expression is \\( a\\cos\\theta - b\\sin\\theta \\), which is the same as \\( a\\cos\\theta + (-b)\\sin\\theta \\), so the maximum should still be R.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the maximum using calculus. Let me think about taking the derivative and setting it to zero to find the maximum.\n\nSo, the real part is \\( f(\\theta) = 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nThe derivative with respect to \\( \\theta \\) is \\( f'(\\theta) = -324\\sin\\theta - 432\\cos\\theta \\).\n\nSetting this equal to zero for extrema:\n\n-324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8 = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by -108 to simplify:\n\n3 sin\u03b8 + 4 cos\u03b8 = 0.\n\nSo, 3 sin\u03b8 = -4 cos\u03b8.\n\nDivide both sides by cos\u03b8 (assuming cos\u03b8 \u22600):\n\n3 tan\u03b8 = -4.\n\nSo, tan\u03b8 = -4/3.\n\nThus, \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3). But since tangent is periodic every \u03c0, the general solution is \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3) + k\u03c0.\n\nBut let's consider \u03b8 in [0, 2\u03c0). So, \u03b8 is in the second or fourth quadrant.\n\nLet me compute \u03b8. Let's say \u03b8 = \u03c0 - arctan(4/3) or \u03b8 = 2\u03c0 - arctan(4/3).\n\nWait, because tan is negative in the second and fourth quadrants. So, in the second quadrant, \u03b8 = \u03c0 - arctan(4/3), and in the fourth quadrant, \u03b8 = 2\u03c0 - arctan(4/3).\n\nNow, to find which one gives the maximum value, let me plug these back into f(\u03b8).\n\nLet me compute f(\u03b8) at \u03b8 = \u03c0 - arctan(4/3):\n\ncos\u03b8 = cos(\u03c0 - arctan(4/3)) = -cos(arctan(4/3)).\n\nSimilarly, sin\u03b8 = sin(\u03c0 - arctan(4/3)) = sin(arctan(4/3)).\n\nWe can compute cos(arctan(4/3)): imagine a right triangle where the opposite side is 4 and the adjacent is 3, so hypotenuse is 5. So, cos(arctan(4/3)) = 3/5, so cos\u03b8 = -3/5.\n\nSimilarly, sin(arctan(4/3))=4/5, so sin\u03b8=4/5.\n\nSo, f(\u03b8) = 324*(-3/5) - 432*(4/5) = (-972/5) - (1728/5) = (-2700)/5 = -540.\n\nHmm, that's the minimum.\n\nNow, let's compute f(\u03b8) at \u03b8 = 2\u03c0 - arctan(4/3):\n\ncos\u03b8 = cos(2\u03c0 - arctan(4/3)) = cos(arctan(4/3)) = 3/5.\n\nsin\u03b8 = sin(2\u03c0 - arctan(4/3)) = -sin(arctan(4/3)) = -4/5.\n\nSo, f(\u03b8) = 324*(3/5) - 432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = 2700/5 = 540.\n\nAh, that's the maximum. So, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, so that aligns with the earlier conclusion using the amplitude method. So, that's reassuring.\n\nSo, the largest possible real part is 540.\n\nBut wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any computational errors. Let me recheck the derivative and the critical points.\n\nf(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nf'(\u03b8) = -324 sin\u03b8 - 432 cos\u03b8.\n\nSet to zero: -324 sin\u03b8 - 432 cos\u03b8 = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by -108: 3 sin\u03b8 + 4 cos\u03b8 = 0.\n\nWhich gives 3 sin\u03b8 = -4 cos\u03b8.\n\nSo, tan\u03b8 = -4/3. Correct.\n\nThen, \u03b8 in second and fourth quadrants.\n\nAt \u03b8 = 2\u03c0 - arctan(4/3), which is in the fourth quadrant, we get the maximum value of 540, as above.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check if this is indeed the maximum. Let me consider another approach.\n\nExpressing the real part as 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8, which is equal to 540 cos(theta + phi), where phi is such that cos(phi) = 324/540 = 3/5 and sin(phi) = 432/540 = 4/5. Wait, but in our expression, it's 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8, which is 324 cos\u03b8 + (-432) sin\u03b8. So, in terms of the formula, a=324, b=-432.\n\nSo, R is sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540.\n\nThen, the expression can be written as R cos(theta - phi), where cos(phi) = a/R = 324/540 = 3/5, and sin(phi) = b/R = (-432)/540 = -4/5.\n\nSo, phi is in the fourth quadrant, with tan(phi) = (-4/5)/(3/5) = -4/3.\n\nThus, phi = arctan(-4/3). Alternatively, since tan is periodic, we can write it as -arctan(4/3).\n\nSo, the expression is 540 cos(theta - (-arctan(4/3))) = 540 cos(theta + arctan(4/3)).\n\nThe maximum of cos is 1, so maximum of the expression is 540 * 1 = 540.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible real part is 540.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this complex math problem here, and I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \\[(75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\], where \\( z \\) is a complex number with \\( |z| = 4 \\). Hmm, alright, let me try to unpack this.\n\nFirst, I remember that any complex number \\( z \\) can be written in the form \\( z = re^{i\\theta} \\), where \\( r \\) is the modulus (or absolute value) of \\( z \\), and \\( \\theta \\) is the argument (or angle). In this case, \\( |z| = 4 \\), so \\( r = 4 \\). That means \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\), right?\n\nSo, substituting \\( z = 4e^{i\\theta} \\) into the expression, let me rewrite the entire thing. The first term is \\( (75 + 117i)z \\), which becomes \\( (75 + 117i) \\times 4e^{i\\theta} \\). The second term is \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{z} \\), which is \\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}} \\).\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nStarting with the first term:\n\n\\( (75 + 117i) \\times 4e^{i\\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} \\).\n\nI can compute the scalar multiplication first: 4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i. So the first term simplifies to \\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} \\).\n\nNow, the second term:\n\n\\( \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}} = \\frac{96 + 144i}{4} \\times e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nDividing 96 + 144i by 4 gives 24 + 36i. So the second term is \\( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nSo putting it all together, the entire expression is:\n\n\\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta} \\).\n\nHmm, now I need to compute the real part of this expression. Let's denote \\( A = 300 + 468i \\) and \\( B = 24 + 36i \\). So the expression becomes \\( A e^{i\\theta} + B e^{-i\\theta} \\). \n\nI remember that for complex numbers, \\( e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta \\) and \\( e^{-i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta \\). So I can express each term as a product of the complex numbers and these exponentials.\n\nLet me compute \\( A e^{i\\theta} \\):\n\n\\( (300 + 468i)(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta) \\).\n\nExpanding this, I get:\n\n300\\cos\\theta + 300i\\sin\\theta + 468i\\cos\\theta + 468i^2\\sin\\theta.\n\nSince \\( i^2 = -1 \\), this becomes:\n\n300\\cos\\theta + 300i\\sin\\theta + 468i\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta.\n\nNow, grouping the real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: 300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta.\n\nImaginary part: 300\\sin\\theta + 468\\cos\\theta.\n\nSimilarly, for \\( B e^{-i\\theta} \\):\n\n\\( (24 + 36i)(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta) \\).\n\nExpanding:\n\n24\\cos\\theta - 24i\\sin\\theta + 36i\\cos\\theta - 36i^2\\sin\\theta.\n\nAgain, \\( i^2 = -1 \\), so:\n\n24\\cos\\theta - 24i\\sin\\theta + 36i\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta.\n\nGrouping real and imaginary:\n\nReal part: 24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta.\n\nImaginary part: (-24\\sin\\theta + 36\\cos\\theta)i.\n\nSo, adding both \\( A e^{i\\theta} \\) and \\( B e^{-i\\theta} \\), the total real part is:\n\n[300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta] + [24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta].\n\nSimplify this:\n\n(300 + 24)\\cos\\theta + (-468 + 36)\\sin\\theta.\n\nWhich is:\n\n324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part would be:\n\n[300\\sin\\theta + 468\\cos\\theta] + [-24\\sin\\theta + 36\\cos\\theta].\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(300 - 24)\\sin\\theta + (468 + 36)\\cos\\theta.\n\nBut since we're only interested in the real part, we can focus on \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nSo, the real part is \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\). Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression as \\( \\theta \\) varies.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form \\( a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta \\) can be rewritten as \\( R\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\), where \\( R = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\) and \\( \\phi = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right) \\) or something like that. So, perhaps I can express \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\) in this form.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's \\( a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta \\), but with a negative sign on the sine term. So, it's \\( a\\cos\\theta - b\\sin\\theta \\). Let me write it as \\( a\\cos\\theta + (-b)\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nSo, using the formula, the amplitude \\( R \\) would be \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + (-b)^2} = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\).\n\nSo, for our case, \\( a = 324 \\), \\( b = 432 \\).\n\nCalculating \\( R \\):\n\n\\( R = \\sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} \\).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n324 squared is... 324*324. Hmm, 300^2 is 90,000, 24^2 is 576, and cross terms are 2*300*24=14,400. So, 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.\n\nWait, wait, actually, 324^2: I think that's 104,976. Let me confirm: 300^2=90,000, 24^2=576, and 2*300*24=14,400. So, (300+24)^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432^2: 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, and 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400+32)^2=160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024=186,624.\n\nSo, R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).\n\nWhat is sqrt(291,600)? Let's see: 540^2 is 291,600 because 500^2=250,000, 40^2=1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000, so (500+40)^2=250,000 +40,000 +1,600=291,600. So, R=540.\n\nSo, the expression \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\) can be written as \\( 540\\cos(\\theta + \\phi) \\) or something similar. Wait, actually, the formula is \\( a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = R\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\), where \\( R = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\) and \\( \\phi = \\arctan(b/a) \\). But in our case, it's \\( a\\cos\\theta - b\\sin\\theta \\), which is equivalent to \\( a\\cos\\theta + (-b)\\sin\\theta \\). So, the amplitude is still R=540, but the phase angle \\( \\phi \\) would be \\( \\arctan((-b)/a) = \\arctan(-432/324) \\).\n\nWait, 432 divided by 324: let's simplify that. Both are divisible by 108. 432 \u00f7 108 = 4, 324 \u00f7 108=3. So, 432/324 = 4/3. So, it's -4/3. So, \\( \\phi = \\arctan(-4/3) \\).\n\nBut since we have a negative inside the arctangent, that would place \\( \\phi \\) in the fourth quadrant, but for the purposes of the formula, perhaps we can take it as a positive angle. Alternatively, maybe we can write it as \\( \\arctan(4/3) \\) but adjust the angle accordingly.\n\nBut regardless, the maximum value of \\( R\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\) is just R, since the maximum of cosine is 1. So, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me make sure.\n\nBecause the expression is \\( 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\), which is \\( 540\\cos(\\theta + \\phi) \\) where \\( \\phi \\) is such that \\( \\cos\\phi = 324/540 \\) and \\( \\sin\\phi = 432/540 \\). Wait, actually, let me think again.\n\nWait, the general formula is \\( a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = R\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\), where \\( R = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\), and \\( \\cos\\phi = a/R \\), \\( \\sin\\phi = b/R \\).\n\nIn our case, the expression is \\( a\\cos\\theta + (-b)\\sin\\theta \\), so it's equivalent to \\( a\\cos\\theta + c\\sin\\theta \\) where c = -b. So, \\( R = \\sqrt{a^2 + c^2} = \\sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = 540 \\).\n\nAnd \\( \\cos\\phi = a/R = 324/540 \\), \\( \\sin\\phi = c/R = (-432)/540 = -4/5.\n\nWait, 324/540 simplifies. Both are divisible by 108: 324 \u00f7108=3, 540 \u00f7108=5. So, 3/5.\n\nSimilarly, 432/540: 432 \u00f7108=4, 540 \u00f7108=5. So, 4/5. But since c is negative, it's -4/5.\n\nSo, \\( \\cos\\phi = 3/5 \\) and \\( \\sin\\phi = -4/5 \\). So, \\( \\phi \\) is in the fourth quadrant, with reference angle \\( \\arctan(4/3) \\). So, the angle is \\( -\\arctan(4/3) \\) or \\( 2\\pi - \\arctan(4/3) \\).\n\nBut regardless of the exact value of \\( \\phi \\), the maximum value of \\( R\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\) is R, since the maximum of cosine is 1. So, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, but I should verify this. Let me think again. Because sometimes when you have expressions like \\( a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta \\), the maximum is R, but in our case, the expression is \\( a\\cos\\theta - b\\sin\\theta \\), which is the same as \\( a\\cos\\theta + (-b)\\sin\\theta \\), so the maximum should still be R.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the maximum using calculus. Let me think about taking the derivative and setting it to zero to find the maximum.\n\nSo, the real part is \\( f(\\theta) = 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nThe derivative with respect to \\( \\theta \\) is \\( f'(\\theta) = -324\\sin\\theta - 432\\cos\\theta \\).\n\nSetting this equal to zero for extrema:\n\n-324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8 = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by -108 to simplify:\n\n3 sin\u03b8 + 4 cos\u03b8 = 0.\n\nSo, 3 sin\u03b8 = -4 cos\u03b8.\n\nDivide both sides by cos\u03b8 (assuming cos\u03b8 \u22600):\n\n3 tan\u03b8 = -4.\n\nSo, tan\u03b8 = -4/3.\n\nThus, \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3). But since tangent is periodic every \u03c0, the general solution is \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3) + k\u03c0.\n\nBut let's consider \u03b8 in [0, 2\u03c0). So, \u03b8 is in the second or fourth quadrant.\n\nLet me compute \u03b8. Let's say \u03b8 = \u03c0 - arctan(4/3) or \u03b8 = 2\u03c0 - arctan(4/3).\n\nWait, because tan is negative in the second and fourth quadrants. So, in the second quadrant, \u03b8 = \u03c0 - arctan(4/3), and in the fourth quadrant, \u03b8 = 2\u03c0 - arctan(4/3).\n\nNow, to find which one gives the maximum value, let me plug these back into f(\u03b8).\n\nLet me compute f(\u03b8) at \u03b8 = \u03c0 - arctan(4/3):\n\ncos\u03b8 = cos(\u03c0 - arctan(4/3)) = -cos(arctan(4/3)).\n\nSimilarly, sin\u03b8 = sin(\u03c0 - arctan(4/3)) = sin(arctan(4/3)).\n\nWe can compute cos(arctan(4/3)): imagine a right triangle where the opposite side is 4 and the adjacent is 3, so hypotenuse is 5. So, cos(arctan(4/3)) = 3/5, so cos\u03b8 = -3/5.\n\nSimilarly, sin(arctan(4/3))=4/5, so sin\u03b8=4/5.\n\nSo, f(\u03b8) = 324*(-3/5) - 432*(4/5) = (-972/5) - (1728/5) = (-2700)/5 = -540.\n\nHmm, that's the minimum.\n\nNow, let's compute f(\u03b8) at \u03b8 = 2\u03c0 - arctan(4/3):\n\ncos\u03b8 = cos(2\u03c0 - arctan(4/3)) = cos(arctan(4/3)) = 3/5.\n\nsin\u03b8 = sin(2\u03c0 - arctan(4/3)) = -sin(arctan(4/3)) = -4/5.\n\nSo, f(\u03b8) = 324*(3/5) - 432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = 2700/5 = 540.\n\nAh, that's the maximum. So, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, so that aligns with the earlier conclusion using the amplitude method.

Let me recheck the derivative and the critical points.\n\nf(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nf'(\u03b8) = -324 sin\u03b8 - 432 cos\u03b8.\n\nSet to zero: -324 sin\u03b8 - 432 cos\u03b8 = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by -108: 3 sin\u03b8 + 4 cos\u03b8 = 0.\n\nWhich gives 3 sin\u03b8 = -4 cos\u03b8.\n\nSo, tan\u03b8 = -4/3. Correct.\n\nThen, \u03b8 in second and fourth quadrants.\n\nAt \u03b8 = 2\u03c0 - arctan(4/3), which is in the fourth quadrant, we get the maximum value of 540, as above.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check if this is indeed the maximum.

Wait, but in our expression, it's 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8, which is 324 cos\u03b8 + (-432) sin\u03b8. So, in terms of the formula, a=324, b=-432.\n\nSo, R is sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540.\n\nThen, the expression can be written as R cos(theta - phi), where cos(phi) = a/R = 324/540 = 3/5, and sin(phi) = b/R = (-432)/540 = -4/5.\n\nSo, phi is in the fourth quadrant, with tan(phi) = (-4/5)/(3/5) = -4/3.\n\nThus, phi = arctan(-4/3).

Now, I need to find the real part of this expression. The real part of a complex number \\( a + ib \\) is just \\( a \\). So, I need to compute the real parts of each term and add them together.\n\nLet me denote \\( A = 75 + 117i \\) and \\( B = 96 + 144i \\).

Let me think. The real part of \\( A e^{i\\theta} \\) is the same as the dot product of the vector representation of \\( A \\) and the vector \\( (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta) \\). So, if \\( A = a + ib \\), then \\( \\text{Re}(A e^{i\\theta}) = a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta \\). Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, \\( A e^{i\\theta} = (a + ib)(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta) \\), which when expanded is \\( a\\cos\\theta - b\\sin\\theta + i(a\\sin\\theta + b\\cos\\theta) \\). So, the real part is \\( a\\cos\\theta - b\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( B e^{-i\\theta} = (c + id)(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta) \\), which becomes \\( c\\cos\\theta + d\\sin\\theta + i(-c\\sin\\theta + d\\cos\\theta) \\). So, the real part is \\( c\\cos\\theta + d\\sin\\theta \\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the real part of the entire expression is:\n\n\\( 4(a \\cos\\theta - b \\sin\\theta) + \\frac{1}{4}(c \\cos\\theta + d \\sin\\theta) \\)\n\nwhere \\( a = 75 \\), \\( b = 117 \\), \\( c = 96 \\), and \\( d = 144 \\).\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nReal part = \\( 4(75 \\cos\\theta - 117 \\sin\\theta) + \\frac{1}{4}(96 \\cos\\theta + 144 \\sin\\theta) \\).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: \\( 4 * 75 \\cos\\theta = 300 \\cos\\theta \\)\nFirst term's second part: \\( 4 * (-117) \\sin\\theta = -468 \\sin\\theta \\)\nSecond term: \\( (1/4) * 96 \\cos\\theta = 24 \\cos\\theta \\)\nSecond term's second part: \\( (1/4) * 144 \\sin\\theta = 36 \\sin\\theta \\)\n\nSo, combining like terms:\n\nReal part = \\( (300 \\cos\\theta + 24 \\cos\\theta) + (-468 \\sin\\theta + 36 \\sin\\theta) \\)\n= \\( 324 \\cos\\theta - 432 \\sin\\theta \\)\n\nSo, the expression we're trying to maximize is \\( 324 \\cos\\theta - 432 \\sin\\theta \\).\n\nNow, this is a linear combination of sine and cosine, which can be expressed as a single sinusoidal function. The maximum value of such an expression \\( R \\cos(\\theta + \\phi) \\) is \\( R \\), where \\( R = \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \\) for an expression \\( A \\cos\\theta + B \\sin\\theta \\). Wait, no, actually, wait. Let me recall: \\( A \\cos\\theta + B \\sin\\theta = C \\cos(\\theta - \\delta) \\) where \\( C = \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \\) and \\( \\tan\\delta = B/A \\). So, the maximum value is \\( C \\), the amplitude.\n\nWait, but in our case, it's \\( 324 \\cos\\theta - 432 \\sin\\theta \\). So, that's equivalent to \\( A \\cos\\theta + B \\sin\\theta \\), where \\( A = 324 \\) and \\( B = -432 \\).\n\nSo, the amplitude \\( R = \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} = \\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \\).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n324 squared: 324 * 324. Let me compute that. 300^2 is 90,000, 24^2 is 576, and the cross term is 2 * 300 * 24 = 14,400. So, (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432 squared: Let's compute 400^2 = 160,000, 32^2=1,024, cross term 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400 +32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 +32^2 = 160,000 +25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.\n\nSo, R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).\n\nWhat's sqrt(291,600)? Let's see, 540^2 is 291,600 because 500^2=250,000, 40^2=1,600, and cross term 2*500*40=40,000. So, 540^2 = 291,600. So, R=540.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of \\( 324 \\cos\\theta -432 \\sin\\theta \\) is 540.\n\nWait, but hold on. I think I might have gotten a bit ahead of myself. Let me double-check. So, the expression is \\( 324 \\cos\\theta - 432 \\sin\\theta \\). The maximum value of this is indeed \\( \\sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} \\). But wait, the coefficient of sine is negative, but in the formula, the maximum is the same regardless of the sign because we square it. So yes, 540 is correct.\n\nSo, the maximum real part is 540. Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I do all the steps correctly?\n\nStarting from the expression:\n\nReal part = \\( 324 \\cos\\theta -432 \\sin\\theta \\).\n\nWe can write this as \\( R \\cos(\\theta + \\phi) \\), where \\( R = \\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = 540 \\).\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the maximum is R, which is 540.\n\nSo, yes, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is to consider the expression \\( 324 \\cos\\theta -432 \\sin\\theta \\) as the dot product of two vectors: (324, -432) and (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8). The maximum value of the dot product is the product of their magnitudes when they are in the same direction. The magnitude of (324, -432) is sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2) = 540, and the magnitude of (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8) is 1, so maximum is 540 * 1 = 540. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, using calculus, we can take the derivative of the real part with respect to \u03b8 and set it to zero to find the maximum. Let's see if that gives the same result.\n\nLet me denote the real part as f(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8.\n\nThen, df/d\u03b8 = -324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8.\n\nSet df/d\u03b8 = 0:\n\n-324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by -36:\n\n9 sin\u03b8 + 12 cos\u03b8 = 0\n\nSo, 9 sin\u03b8 = -12 cos\u03b8\n\nDivide both sides by cos\u03b8 (assuming cos\u03b8 \u22600):\n\n9 tan\u03b8 = -12\n\ntan\u03b8 = -12/9 = -4/3\n\nSo, \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3). But since tangent is periodic with \u03c0, we can take \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3) + k\u03c0.\n\nSo, the critical points are at \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3) and \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3) + \u03c0.\n\nBut let's compute f(\u03b8) at these points.\n\nFirst, let me compute sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8 for \u03b8 where tan\u03b8 = -4/3.\n\nSo, in the first case, \u03b8 is in the fourth quadrant (since tan\u03b8 is negative). So, let's imagine a right triangle with opposite side -4 (or 4 in magnitude) and adjacent 3, hypotenuse 5.\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 = -4/5, cos\u03b8 = 3/5.\n\nSo, f(\u03b8) = 324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (324*3 + 432*4)/5\n\nCompute numerator: 324*3=972, 432*4=1,728. Sum is 972 + 1,728 = 2,700.\n\nSo, f(\u03b8) = 2,700 /5 = 540.\n\nIn the other case, \u03b8 is in the second quadrant (adding \u03c0 to the previous angle), so sin\u03b8 = 4/5 and cos\u03b8 = -3/5.\n\nThen, f(\u03b8) = 324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5) = (-972 - 1,728)/5 = (-2,700)/5 = -540.\n\nSo, the maximum is indeed 540, and the minimum is -540.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible real part is 540.\n",
