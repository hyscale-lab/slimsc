      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)| given a system of logarithmic equations. Hmm, let's see. I remember that logarithms can be tricky, especially when dealing with multiple variables, but maybe I can simplify this by converting the log equations into exponential form. \n\nThe equations given are:\n\n1. log\u2082(x/(yz)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y/(xz)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z/(xy)) = 1/4\n\nI think the first step is to rewrite each equation in terms of exponents. That way, I can express x, y, and z in some relation. Let me recall that log\u2082(a) = b is equivalent to a = 2\u1d47. So applying that:\n\n1. x/(yz) = 2^(1/2) \u2192 x = yz * \u221a2\n2. y/(xz) = 2^(1/3) \u2192 y = xz * 2^(1/3)\n3. z/(xy) = 2^(1/4) \u2192 z = xy * 2^(1/4)\n\nHmm, so now I have three equations:\n\nx = yz * \u221a2  ...(1)\ny = xz * 2^(1/3) ...(2)\nz = xy * 2^(1/4) ...(3)\n\nThis seems a bit circular, but maybe I can substitute one equation into another to find expressions for x, y, z.\n\nLet me try substituting equation (1) into equation (2). So, equation (2) says y = xz * 2^(1/3). But from equation (1), x = yz\u221a2. So substituting x into equation (2):\n\ny = (yz\u221a2) * z * 2^(1/3)\n\nLet me write that out:\n\ny = y z\u00b2 \u221a2 * 2^(1/3)\n\nSimplify the exponents: \u221a2 is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) = 2^(1/2 + 1/3). Let me compute 1/2 + 1/3. That's (3 + 2)/6 = 5/6. So 2^(5/6).\n\nSo now, y = y z\u00b2 * 2^(5/6)\n\nHmm, let's divide both sides by y (assuming y \u2260 0, which it is positive, so that's okay):\n\n1 = z\u00b2 * 2^(5/6)\n\nSo, z\u00b2 = 1 / (2^(5/6)) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nTaking square roots on both sides:\n\nz = 2^(-5/12) since z is positive.\n\nWait, because sqrt(2^(-5/6)) is 2^(-5/12). Right, because sqrt(a) is a^(1/2), so (2^(-5/6))^(1/2) = 2^(-5/12). \n\nSo now I have z = 2^(-5/12). \n\nGreat, that's one variable found. Now let's find another variable, maybe x or y.\n\nLooking back at equation (3): z = xy * 2^(1/4). We know z, so:\n\n2^(-5/12) = xy * 2^(1/4)\n\nSo, xy = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, xy = 2^(-2/3). Let's keep that in mind.\n\nNow, let's use equation (1): x = yz * \u221a2. We know z, so let's substitute:\n\nx = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2)\n\nSimplify the exponents: 2^(-5/12 + 6/12) = 2^(1/12). Wait, 2^(1/2) is 2^(6/12), so adding (-5/12 +6/12) gives 1/12.\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nBut from earlier, we have that xy = 2^(-2/3). So substituting x from here into that equation:\n\n(y * 2^(1/12)) * y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nWhich is y\u00b2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 - 1/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nTaking square roots:\n\ny = 2^(-3/8) because y is positive.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nNow, using equation (1) again: x = yz * \u221a2. Let's compute x:\n\nx = (2^(-3/8)) * (2^(-5/12)) * 2^(1/2)\n\nFirst, let's add the exponents:\n\n-3/8 -5/12 + 1/2\n\nLet me find a common denominator, which is 24.\n\n-3/8 = -9/24\n-5/12 = -10/24\n1/2 = 12/24\n\nAdding them: (-9 -10 +12)/24 = (-19 +12)/24 = (-7)/24\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check the addition again.\n\nWait, the exponents are:\n\ny: 2^(-3/8) \u2192 exponent is -3/8\nz: 2^(-5/12) \u2192 exponent is -5/12\n\u221a2 is 2^(1/2) \u2192 exponent is +1/2\n\nSo total exponent: (-3/8) + (-5/12) + (1/2)\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n-3/8 = -9/24\n-5/12 = -10/24\n1/2 = 12/24\n\nAdding: (-9 -10 +12)/24 = (-19 +12)/24 = (-7)/24\n\nYes, correct. So x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nSo now, we have:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nWait, let me write all exponents with denominator 24 for consistency:\n\n-7/24 is already 24 denominator.\n\n-3/8 = -9/24\n\n-5/12 = -10/24\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-9/24)\nz = 2^(-10/24)\n\nHmm, okay. Now, the question is asking for |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|.\n\nSo, let me compute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2):\n\nlog\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(x\u2074) + log\u2082(y\u00b3) + log\u2082(z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082 x + 3 log\u2082 y + 2 log\u2082 z\n\nSince log\u2082(2^a) = a, so:\n\nlog\u2082 x = (-7/24)\nlog\u2082 y = (-9/24)\nlog\u2082 z = (-10/24)\n\nSo,\n\n4 log\u2082 x = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6\n3 log\u2082 y = 3*(-9/24) = -27/24 = -9/8\n2 log\u2082 z = 2*(-10/24) = -20/24 = -5/6\n\nAdding them together:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nLet me find a common denominator, which is 24.\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n-9/8 = -27/24\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nAdding all three: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify: -75/24 can be reduced. Divide numerator and denominator by 3: -25/8.\n\nSo, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = -25/8.\n\nTaking the absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo, the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms since 25 and 8 are coprime. So m=25, n=8, and m+n=33.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with all these fractions.\n\nStarting from the exponents:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24), so log\u2082 x = -7/24\ny = 2^(-9/24), so log\u2082 y = -9/24\nz = 2^(-10/24), so log\u2082 z = -10/24\n\nCompute 4 log\u2082 x: 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6\n3 log\u2082 y: 3*(-9/24) = -27/24 = -9/8\n2 log\u2082 z: 2*(-10/24) = -20/24 = -5/6\n\nSum: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nConvert all to 24 denominator:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n-9/8 = -27/24\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nTotal: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8\n\nYes, that's correct. So the absolute value is 25/8, so m=25, n=8, sum is 33.\n",

So the absolute value is 25/8, so m=25, n=8, sum is 33.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by converting the given logarithmic equations into exponential form:\n\n1. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies \\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} \\implies x = yz \\cdot \\sqrt{2}\\)\n2. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\implies \\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3} \\implies y = xz \\cdot 2^{1/3}\\)\n3. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\implies \\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4} \\implies z = xy \\cdot 2^{1/4}\\)\n\nNext, substitute \\(x = yz \\cdot \\sqrt{2}\\) into the second equation:\n\\[\ny = (yz \\cdot \\sqrt{2}) \\cdot z \\cdot 2^{1/3} \\implies y = yz^2 \\cdot 2^{5/6}\n\\]\nDividing both sides by \\(y\\):\n\\[\n1 = z^2 \\cdot 2^{5/6} \\implies z^2 = 2^{-5/6} \\implies z = 2^{-5/12}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(z = 2^{-5/12}\\) into the third equation:\n\\[\n2^{-5/12} = xy \\cdot 2^{1/4} \\implies xy = 2^{-5/12 - 1/4} = 2^{-2/3}\n\\]\n\nUsing \\(x = yz \\cdot \\sqrt{2}\\) and substituting \\(z = 2^{-5/12}\\):\n\\[\nx = y \\cdot 2^{-5/12} \\cdot 2^{1/2} = y \\cdot 2^{1/12}\n\\]\nSubstitute \\(x = y \\cdot 2^{1/12}\\) into \\(xy = 2^{-2/3}\\):\n\\[\n(y \\cdot 2^{1/12}) \\cdot y = 2^{-2/3} \\implies y^2 \\cdot 2^{1/12} = 2^{-2/3} \\implies y^2 = 2^{-2/3 - 1/12} = 2^{-3/4} \\implies y = 2^{-3/8}\n\\]\n\nFinally, substitute \\(y = 2^{-3/8}\\) and \\(z = 2^{-5/12}\\) into \\(x = yz \\cdot \\sqrt{2}\\):\n\\[\nx = (2^{-3/8}) \\cdot (2^{-5/12}) \\cdot 2^{1/2} = 2^{-7/24}\n\\]\n\nNow, compute \\(\\left|\\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\\right|\\):\n\\[\n\\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \\log_2 x + 3 \\log_2 y + 2 \\log_2 z\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_2 x = -\\frac{7}{24}, \\quad \\log_2 y = -\\frac{9}{24}, \\quad \\log_2 z = -\\frac{10}{24}\n\\]\n\\[\n4 \\log_2 x = 4 \\cdot -\\frac{7}{24} = -\\frac{7}{6}, \\quad 3 \\log_2 y = 3 \\cdot -\\frac{9}{24} = -\\frac{9}{8}, \\quad 2 \\log_2 z = 2 \\cdot -\\frac{10}{24} = -\\frac{5}{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -\\frac{7}{6} - \\frac{9}{8} - \\frac{5}{6} = -\\frac{25}{8}\n\\]\nTaking the absolute value:\n\\[\n\\left|\\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\\right| = \\frac{25}{8}\n\\]\nThus, \\(m = 25\\) and \\(n = 8\\), so \\(m + n = 33\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{33}\\)",

So x y z = 2^(-13/12)\n\nI need to find log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2).

Alternatively, maybe I can find expressions for x, y, z in terms of each other and substitute.\n\nWait, let's see. I have from equation (1): x = \u221a2 y z\n\nFrom equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) x z\n\nFrom equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) x y\n\nI could try substituting x from equation (1) into equations (2) and (3).\n\nFrom equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * (\u221a2 y z) * z = 2^(1/3) * \u221a2 * y z\u00b2\n\nSimplify the constants: 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6)\n\nSo equation (2) becomes: y = 2^(5/6) y z\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by y (since y \u2260 0): 1 = 2^(5/6) z\u00b2 \u21d2 z\u00b2 = 2^(-5/6) \u21d2 z = 2^(-5/12)\n\nBecause z is positive, so we take the positive root.\n\nSo z = 2^(-5/12)\n\nSimilarly, maybe I can find x and y.\n\nFrom equation (1): x = \u221a2 y z = 2^(1/2) y z\n\nWe know z is 2^(-5/12), so plug that in:\n\nx = 2^(1/2) y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 -5/12)\n\nCompute the exponent: 1/2 = 6/12, so 6/12 -5/12=1/12. So x = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nSo x = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nNow, let's go to equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) x y\n\nWe know z = 2^(-5/12) and x = y * 2^(1/12), so plug in:\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * (y * 2^(1/12)) * y\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 2^(1/4) * y * 2^(1/12) * y = 2^(1/4 +1/12) * y\u00b2\n\nCompute 1/4 +1/12: 3/12 +1/12 =4/12=1/3. So:\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/3) * y\u00b2\n\nSo, divide both sides by 2^(1/3): 2^(-5/12 -1/3) = y\u00b2\n\nConvert 1/3 to 4/12: 2^(-5/12 -4/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4) = y\u00b2\n\nSo y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4), which implies y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nBecause y is positive, so we take the positive root.\n\nSo y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nNow, from earlier, x = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12)\n\nCompute the exponent: Convert to common denominator 24.\n\n-3/8 = -9/24, 1/12=2/24. So -9/24 +2/24= -7/24.\n\nThus, x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nSo now, I have x, y, z in terms of powers of 2:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\n\ny = 2^(-3/8)\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nWait, let me check if these satisfy the earlier equation x y z = 2^(-13/12)\n\nCompute x y z:\n\n2^(-7/24) * 2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-7/24 -9/24 -10/24) [since -3/8 is -9/24, -5/12 is -10/24]\n\nSum exponents: (-7 -9 -10)/24 = (-26)/24 = -13/12. Yes, that matches. Good.\n\nSo now, I need to compute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2).\n\nSince x, y, z are powers of 2, let's express x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 as:\n\nx\u2074 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/24 *4)=2^(-7/6)\n\ny\u00b3 = (2^(-3/8))^3=2^(-9/8)\n\nz\u00b2 = (2^(-5/12))^2=2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiply them together:\n\nx\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)\n\nCompute the exponent:\n\nFirst, convert all to 24 denominators.\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nSum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8\n\nSo x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8)\n\nThen, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8\n\nBut the question asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|, so the absolute value is | -25/8 | =25/8\n\n25 and 8 are coprime, so m=25, n=8. Therefore, m+n=33.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps because 25/8 seems a bit large, but let me see.\n\nWait, when I computed x, y, z:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24), y=2^(-3/8)=2^(-9/24), z=2^(-5/12)=2^(-10/24)\n\nSo x^4: exponent 4*(-7/24)= -28/24= -7/6\n\ny^3: exponent 3*(-9/24)= -27/24= -9/8\n\nz^2: exponent 2*(-10/24)= -20/24= -5/6\n\nAdding exponents: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n-7/6= -28/24, -9/8= -27/24, -5/6= -20/24\n\nTotal: (-28 -27 -20)/24= (-75)/24= -25/8.\n\nYes, that's correct. So log is -25/8, absolute is 25/8.\n\nSo m=25, n=8, m+n=33.\n",

So:\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/3) * y\u00b2\n\nSo, divide both sides by 2^(1/3): 2^(-5/12 -1/3) = y\u00b2\n\nConvert 1/3 to 4/12: 2^(-5/12 -4/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4) = y\u00b2\n\nSo y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4), which implies y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nBecause y is positive, so we take the positive root.\n\nSo y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nNow, from earlier, x = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12)\n\nCompute the exponent: Convert to common denominator 24.\n\n-3/8 = -9/24, 1/12=2/24. So -9/24 +2/24= -7/24.\n\nThus, x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nSo now, I have x, y, z in terms of powers of 2:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\n\ny = 2^(-3/8)\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nWait, let me check if these satisfy the earlier equation x y z = 2^(-13/12)\n\nCompute x y z:\n\n2^(-7/24) * 2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-7/24 -9/24 -10/24) [since -3/8 is -9/24, -5/12 is -10/24]\n\nSum exponents: (-7 -9 -10)/24 = (-26)/24 = -13/12. Yes, that matches. Good.\n\nSo now, I need to compute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2).\n\nSince x, y, z are powers of 2, let's express x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 as:\n\nx\u2074 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/24 *4)=2^(-7/6)\n\ny\u00b3 = (2^(-3/8))^3=2^(-9/8)\n\nz\u00b2 = (2^(-5/12))^2=2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiply them together:\n\nx\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)\n\nCompute the exponent:\n\nFirst, convert all to 24 denominators.\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nSum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8\n\nSo x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8)\n\nThen, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8\n\nBut the question asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|, so the absolute value is | -25/8 | =25/8\n\n25 and 8 are coprime, so m=25, n=8. Therefore, m+n=33.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps because 25/8 seems a bit large, but let me see.\n\nWait, when I computed x, y, z:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24), y=2^(-3/8)=2^(-9/24), z=2^(-5/12)=2^(-10/24)\n\nSo x^4: exponent 4*(-7/24)= -28/24= -7/6\n\ny^3: exponent 3*(-9/24)= -27/24= -9/8\n\nz^2: exponent 2*(-10/24)= -20/24= -5/6\n\nAdding exponents: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n-7/6= -28/24, -9/8= -27/24, -5/6= -20/24\n\nTotal: (-28 -27 -20)/24= (-75)/24= -25/8.\n\nYes, that's correct. So log is -25/8, absolute is 25/8.\n\nSo m=25, n=8, m+n=33.\n\n\nWe start with the given system of logarithmic equations:\n\n1. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n2. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\)\n3. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\nConverting these to exponential form:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\\)\n\nMultiplying all three equations together:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{yz} \\cdot \\frac{y}{xz} \\cdot \\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/2} \\cdot 2^{1/3} \\cdot 2^{1/4}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x \\cdot y \\cdot z}{(yz) \\cdot (xz) \\cdot (xy)} = \\frac{1}{(x y z)}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side:\n\n\\[\n2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4} = 2^{13/12}\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x y z} = 2^{13/12} \\implies x y z = 2^{-13/12}\n\\]\n\nNext, express \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) in terms of powers of 2:\n\n1.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Then, I have to find m + n. The given system of equations involves logarithms, so I think I'll need to manipulate these equations to find expressions for x, y, z or maybe find a relationship between them.\n\nLet me write down the equations again:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nHmm, since these are logarithms with base 2, I can convert them into exponential form to make them easier to handle. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.\n\nSo, for the first equation:\n\nlog\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2 \u21d2 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)\n\nSimilarly for the others:\n\n2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)\n3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)\n\nSo now I have three equations:\n\n1. x = 2^(1/2) * y z\n2. y = 2^(1/3) * x z\n3. z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nHmm, these look a bit interdependent. Maybe I can express all variables in terms of one variable, say x, and then solve for x.\n\nLet me try substituting. From equation 1: x = sqrt(2) * y z. Let me keep that in mind.\n\nFrom equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) * x z. But x is sqrt(2) * y z, so substituting that in:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * (sqrt(2) * y z) * z\n\nSimplify that:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2) * y z^2\n\nLet me write sqrt(2) as 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6). So:\n\ny = 2^(5/6) * y * z^2\n\nHmm, I can divide both sides by y (since y is positive, so it's non-zero):\n\n1 = 2^(5/6) * z^2\n\nSo z^2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6). Therefore, z = 2^(-5/12). Wait, because z is positive, so the square root is positive.\n\nWait, z^2 = 2^(-5/6) \u21d2 z = (2^(-5/6))^(1/2) = 2^(-5/12).\n\nOkay, so z is 2^(-5/12). Got that.\n\nNow, let's go back to equation 1: x = sqrt(2) * y z.\n\nWe have z, so let's write that as x = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12). Let me compute the exponents:\n\n1/2 is 6/12, minus 5/12 is 1/12. So 2^(1/2 -5/12) = 2^(1/12). So x = 2^(1/12) * y.\n\nSo x = 2^(1/12) y.\n\nNow, let's go to equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * x y.\n\nWe know z is 2^(-5/12), and x is 2^(1/12) y, so substitute those in:\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * (2^(1/12) y) * y\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\nFirst, 2^(1/4) is 2^(3/12), 2^(1/12) is 2^(1/12). Multiplying those exponents: 3/12 + 1/12 = 4/12 = 1/3. So 2^(1/3).\n\nThen, y * y = y^2.\n\nSo right side is 2^(1/3) y^2.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/3) y^2\n\nLet me write 2^(1/3) as 2^(4/12), so 4/12 -5/12 = -1/12. So 2^(-1/12) = y^2.\n\nTherefore, y^2 = 2^(-1/12) \u21d2 y = 2^(-1/24). Since y is positive.\n\nSo y = 2^(-1/24). Now, we can find x.\n\nFrom earlier, x = 2^(1/12) y = 2^(1/12) * 2^(-1/24) = 2^(1/12 - 1/24) = 2^(1/24).\n\nSo x is 2^(1/24), y is 2^(-1/24), z is 2^(-5/12).\n\nLet me recap:\n\nx = 2^(1/24)\n\ny = 2^(-1/24)\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nWait, let me check if these values satisfy all three equations. Maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nFirst, equation 1: x/(y z) = [2^(1/24)] / [2^(-1/24) * 2^(-5/12)].\n\nCompute the denominator: 2^(-1/24 -5/12) = 2^(-1/24 -10/24) = 2^(-11/24).\n\nSo x/(y z) = 2^(1/24) / 2^(-11/24) = 2^(1/24 +11/24) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2) = sqrt(2). So log\u2082(sqrt(2))=1/2, which matches equation 1.\n\nEquation 2: y/(x z) = [2^(-1/24)] / [2^(1/24) * 2^(-5/12)].\n\nDenominator: 2^(1/24 -5/12) = 2^(1/24 -10/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8).\n\nSo y/(x z) = 2^(-1/24) / 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-1/24 + 3/8) = 2^(-1/24 +9/24)=2^(8/24)=2^(1/3). So log\u2082(2^(1/3))=1/3, which is correct.\n\nEquation 3: z/(x y) = [2^(-5/12)] / [2^(1/24) * 2^(-1/24)].\n\nDenominator: 2^(1/24 -1/24)=2^0=1. So z/(x y)=2^(-5/12)/1=2^(-5/12). So log\u2082(2^(-5/12))=-5/12. But the equation says it's 1/4. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, equation 3 is log\u2082(z/(x y))=1/4, which should be 2^(1/4) = z/(x y). But according to our calculation, z/(x y)=2^(-5/12). So 2^(1/4) should equal 2^(-5/12)?\n\nWait, 1/4 is 3/12, and -5/12 is negative, so 2^(3/12)=2^(1/4)=sqrt[4]{2}\u22481.189, whereas 2^(-5/12)=1/(2^(5/12))\u22481/(1.2009)\u22480.832. These are not equal. So something's wrong.\n\nHmm, that means I made a mistake in my earlier steps. Let me retrace.\n\nStarting from equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) x y.\n\nWe had z = 2^(-5/12), x = 2^(1/24), y=2^(-1/24). So let's compute 2^(1/4) * x * y.\n\n2^(1/4) is 2^(3/12). x is 2^(1/24)=2^(0.5/12). y is 2^(-1/24)=2^(-0.5/12).\n\nMultiplying them: 2^(3/12 + 0.5/12 -0.5/12) = 2^(3/12)=2^(1/4). So z should be 2^(1/4), but earlier, I found z=2^(-5/12). So this is a contradiction.\n\nSo that suggests that I made a mistake earlier when solving for z.\n\nWait, let's go back. When I substituted equation 1 into equation 2, I think I might have messed up.\n\nEquation 2: y = 2^(1/3) x z.\n\nBut from equation 1, x = 2^(1/2) y z.\n\nSo substituting x into equation 2:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * (2^(1/2) y z) * z.\n\nSo y = 2^(1/3 +1/2) * y * z^2.\n\n2^(1/3 +1/2) is 2^(2/6 +3/6)=2^(5/6).\n\nSo y = 2^(5/6) y z^2.\n\nDivide both sides by y: 1 = 2^(5/6) z^2.\n\nSo z^2 = 2^(-5/6), so z = 2^(-5/12). So that part was correct.\n\nThen, equation 1: x = 2^(1/2) y z.\n\nWe have z=2^(-5/12), so x = 2^(1/2) y * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/2 -5/12) y.\n\n1/2 is 6/12, 6/12 -5/12=1/12. So x =2^(1/12) y.\n\nThen, equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) x y.\n\nSo substituting x=2^(1/12) y and z=2^(-5/12):\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * (2^(1/12) y) * y.\n\nCompute the right side:\n\n2^(1/4 +1/12) * y^2.\n\nConvert 1/4 to 3/12, so 3/12 +1/12=4/12=1/3.\n\nSo right side is 2^(1/3) y^2.\n\nSo 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/3) y^2.\n\nSo y^2 = 2^(-5/12 -1/3) = 2^(-5/12 -4/12)=2^(-9/12)=2^(-3/4).\n\nWait, wait, that's different from what I did earlier. Oh! I think I messed up here.\n\nWait, 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/3) y^2.\n\nSo y^2 = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/3) = 2^(-5/12 -4/12)=2^(-9/12)=2^(-3/4).\n\nSo y^2 = 2^(-3/4), so y=2^(-3/8).\n\nWait, earlier I thought y was 2^(-1/24). So that was wrong. I must have made a mistake in the exponents.\n\nSo let's correct that. y^2=2^(-3/4), so y=2^(-3/8). So y=2^(-3/8).\n\nThen, x=2^(1/12) y =2^(1/12)*2^(-3/8)=2^(1/12 -3/8). Let's compute 1/12 -3/8.\n\nConvert to 24ths: 1/12=2/24, 3/8=9/24. So 2/24 -9/24= -7/24. So x=2^(-7/24).\n\nSo x=2^(-7/24), y=2^(-3/8), z=2^(-5/12).\n\nLet me check equation 3 again: z/(x y) should be 2^(1/4).\n\nCompute z/(x y):\n\nz =2^(-5/12), x=2^(-7/24), y=2^(-3/8).\n\nSo x y =2^(-7/24 -3/8)=2^(-7/24 -9/24)=2^(-16/24)=2^(-2/3).\n\nThen, z/(x y)=2^(-5/12)/2^(-2/3)=2^(-5/12 +2/3)=2^(-5/12 +8/12)=2^(3/12)=2^(1/4). So yes, that's correct. So equation 3 is satisfied.\n\nSo, correct values:\n\nx=2^(-7/24)\n\ny=2^(-3/8)\n\nz=2^(-5/12)\n\nLet me write these exponents in terms of 24 denominator to make it easier.\n\n-7/24, -9/24, -10/24.\n\nWait, because:\n\n-3/8 = -9/24\n\n-5/12= -10/24\n\nSo x=2^(-7/24), y=2^(-9/24), z=2^(-10/24).\n\nHmm, so that's better.\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.\n\nSo let's compute x^4 y^3 z^2.\n\nExpressed in exponents:\n\nx^4 = (2^(-7/24))^4=2^(-28/24)=2^(-7/6)\n\ny^3 = (2^(-9/24))^3=2^(-27/24)=2^(-9/8)\n\nz^2 = (2^(-10/24))^2=2^(-20/24)=2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiply them together:\n\nx^4 y^3 z^2=2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)\n\nCompute the exponents:\n\nLet me find a common denominator for the fractions. 6,8,6. The least common denominator is 24.\n\nConvert each:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nSum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8.\n\nSo x^4 y^3 z^2=2^(-25/8).\n\nTherefore, log\u2082(x^4 y^3 z^2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8))= -25/8.\n\nTaking absolute value: | -25/8 | =25/8.\n\nSo m=25, n=8. They are coprime. So m +n=25+8=33.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the exponents.\n\nx^4 is (2^(-7/24))^4=2^(-7/24 *4)=2^(-7/6). Correct.\n\ny^3: (2^(-9/24))^3=2^(-9/24 *3)=2^(-9/8). Correct.\n\nz^2: (2^(-10/24))^2=2^(-10/24 *2)=2^(-5/6). Correct.\n\nAdding exponents: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6).\n\nConvert all to 24 denominator:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8= -27/24\n\n-5/6= -20/24\n\nSum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8. Correct.\n\nSo log\u2082 is -25/8. Absolute value is 25/8. So m=25, n=8, sum 33.\n\nI think that's correct.\n",

Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.\n\nSo, for the first equation:\n\nlog\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2 \u21d2 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)\n\nSimilarly for the others:\n\n2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)\n3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)\n\nSo now I have three equations:\n\n1. x = 2^(1/2) * y z\n2. y = 2^(1/3) * x z\n3. z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nHmm, these look a bit interdependent. Maybe I can express all variables in terms of one variable, say x, and then solve for x.\n\nLet me try substituting. From equation 1: x = sqrt(2) * y z. Let me keep that in mind.\n\nFrom equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) * x z. But x is sqrt(2) * y z, so substituting that in:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * (sqrt(2) * y z) * z\n\nSimplify that:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2) * y z^2\n\nLet me write sqrt(2) as 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6). So:\n\ny = 2^(5/6) * y * z^2\n\nHmm, I can divide both sides by y (since y is positive, so it's non-zero):\n\n1 = 2^(5/6) * z^2\n\nSo z^2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6). Therefore, z = 2^(-5/12). Wait, because z is positive, so the square root is positive.\n\nWait, z^2 = 2^(-5/6) \u21d2 z = (2^(-5/6))^(1/2) = 2^(-5/12).\n\nOkay, so z is 2^(-5/12). Got that.\n\nNow, let's go back to equation 1: x = sqrt(2) * y z.\n\nWe have z, so let's write that as x = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12). Let me compute the exponents:\n\n1/2 is 6/12, minus 5/12 is 1/12. So 2^(1/2 -5/12) = 2^(1/12). So x = 2^(1/12) * y.\n\nSo x = 2^(1/12) y.\n\nNow, let's go to equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * x y.\n\nWe know z is 2^(-5/12), and x is 2^(1/12) y, so substitute those in:\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * (2^(1/12) y) * y\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\nFirst, 2^(1/4) is 2^(3/12), 2^(1/12) is 2^(1/12). Multiplying those exponents: 3/12 + 1/12 = 4/12 = 1/3. So 2^(1/3).\n\nThen, y * y = y^2.\n\nSo right side is 2^(1/3) y^2.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/3) y^2\n\nLet me write 2^(1/3) as 2^(4/12), so 4/12 -5/12 = -1/12. So 2^(-1/12) = y^2.\n\nTherefore, y^2 = 2^(-1/12) \u21d2 y = 2^(-1/24). Since y is positive.\n\nSo y = 2^(-1/24). Now, we can find x.\n\nFrom earlier, x = 2^(1/12) y = 2^(1/12) * 2^(-1/24) = 2^(1/12 - 1/24) = 2^(1/24).\n\nSo x is 2^(1/24), y is 2^(-1/24), z is 2^(-5/12).\n\nLet me recap:\n\nx = 2^(1/24)\n\ny = 2^(-1/24)\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nWait, let me check if these values satisfy all three equations. Maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nFirst, equation 1: x/(y z) = [2^(1/24)] / [2^(-1/24) * 2^(-5/12)].\n\nCompute the denominator: 2^(-1/24 -5/12) = 2^(-1/24 -10/24) = 2^(-11/24).\n\nSo x/(y z) = 2^(1/24) / 2^(-11/24) = 2^(1/24 +11/24) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2) = sqrt(2). So log\u2082(sqrt(2))=1/2, which matches equation 1.\n\nEquation 2: y/(x z) = [2^(-1/24)] / [2^(1/24) * 2^(-5/12)].\n\nDenominator: 2^(1/24 -5/12) = 2^(1/24 -10/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8).\n\nSo y/(x z) = 2^(-1/24) / 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-1/24 + 3/8) = 2^(-1/24 +9/24)=2^(8/24)=2^(1/3). So log\u2082(2^(1/3))=1/3, which is correct.\n\nEquation 3: z/(x y) = [2^(-5/12)] / [2^(1/24) * 2^(-1/24)].\n\nDenominator: 2^(1/24 -1/24)=2^0=1. So z/(x y)=2^(-5/12)/1=2^(-5/12). So log\u2082(2^(-5/12))=-5/12. But the equation says it's 1/4. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, equation 3 is log\u2082(z/(x y))=1/4, which should be 2^(1/4) = z/(x y). But according to our calculation, z/(x y)=2^(-5/12). So 2^(1/4) should equal 2^(-5/12)?\n\nWait, 1/4 is 3/12, and -5/12 is negative, so 2^(3/12)=2^(1/4)=sqrt[4]{2}\u22481.189, whereas 2^(-5/12)=1/(2^(5/12))\u22481/(1.2009)\u22480.832. These are not equal. So something's wrong.\n\nHmm, that means I made a mistake in my earlier steps. Let me retrace.\n\nStarting from equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) x y.\n\nWe had z = 2^(-5/12), x = 2^(1/24), y=2^(-1/24). So let's compute 2^(1/4) * x * y.\n\n2^(1/4) is 2^(3/12). x is 2^(1/24)=2^(0.5/12). y is 2^(-1/24)=2^(-0.5/12).\n\nMultiplying them: 2^(3/12 + 0.5/12 -0.5/12) = 2^(3/12)=2^(1/4). So z should be 2^(1/4), but earlier, I found z=2^(-5/12). So this is a contradiction.\n\nSo that suggests that I made a mistake earlier when solving for z.\n\nWait, let's go back. When I substituted equation 1 into equation 2, I think I might have messed up.\n\nEquation 2: y = 2^(1/3) x z.\n\nBut from equation 1, x = 2^(1/2) y z.\n\nSo substituting x into equation 2:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * (2^(1/2) y z) * z.\n\nSo y = 2^(1/3 +1/2) * y * z^2.\n\n2^(1/3 +1/2) is 2^(2/6 +3/6)=2^(5/6).\n\nSo y = 2^(5/6) y z^2.\n\nDivide both sides by y: 1 = 2^(5/6) z^2.\n\nSo z^2 = 2^(-5/6), so z = 2^(-5/12). So that part was correct.\n\nThen, equation 1: x = 2^(1/2) y z.\n\nWe have z=2^(-5/12), so x = 2^(1/2) y * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/2 -5/12) y.\n\n1/2 is 6/12, 6/12 -5/12=1/12. So x =2^(1/12) y.\n\nThen, equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) x y.\n\nSo substituting x=2^(1/12) y and z=2^(-5/12):\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * (2^(1/12) y) * y.\n\nCompute the right side:\n\n2^(1/4 +1/12) * y^2.\n\nConvert 1/4 to 3/12, so 3/12 +1/12=4/12=1/3.\n\nSo right side is 2^(1/3) y^2.\n\nSo 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/3) y^2.\n\nSo y^2 = 2^(-5/12 -1/3) = 2^(-5/12 -4/12)=2^(-9/12)=2^(-3/4).\n\nWait, wait, that's different from what I did earlier. Oh! I think I messed up here.\n\nWait, 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/3) y^2.\n\nSo y^2 = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/3) = 2^(-5/12 -4/12)=2^(-9/12)=2^(-3/4).\n\nSo y^2 = 2^(-3/4), so y=2^(-3/8).\n\nWait, earlier I thought y was 2^(-1/24). So that was wrong. I must have made a mistake in the exponents.\n\nSo let's correct that. y^2=2^(-3/4), so y=2^(-3/8). So y=2^(-3/8).\n\nThen, x=2^(1/12) y =2^(1/12)*2^(-3/8)=2^(1/12 -3/8). Let's compute 1/12 -3/8.\n\nConvert to 24ths: 1/12=2/24, 3/8=9/24. So 2/24 -9/24= -7/24. So x=2^(-7/24).\n\nSo x=2^(-7/24), y=2^(-3/8), z=2^(-5/12).\n\nLet me check equation 3 again: z/(x y) should be 2^(1/4).\n\nCompute z/(x y):\n\nz =2^(-5/12), x=2^(-7/24), y=2^(-3/8).\n\nSo x y =2^(-7/24 -3/8)=2^(-7/24 -9/24)=2^(-16/24)=2^(-2/3).\n\nThen, z/(x y)=2^(-5/12)/2^(-2/3)=2^(-5/12 +2/3)=2^(-5/12 +8/12)=2^(3/12)=2^(1/4). So yes, that's correct. So equation 3 is satisfied.\n\nSo, correct values:\n\nx=2^(-7/24)\n\ny=2^(-3/8)\n\nz=2^(-5/12)\n\nLet me write these exponents in terms of 24 denominator to make it easier.\n\n-7/24, -9/24, -10/24.\n\nWait, because:\n\n-3/8 = -9/24\n\n-5/12= -10/24\n\nSo x=2^(-7/24), y=2^(-9/24), z=2^(-10/24).\n\nHmm, so that's better.\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.\n\nSo let's compute x^4 y^3 z^2.\n\nExpressed in exponents:\n\nx^4 = (2^(-7/24))^4=2^(-28/24)=2^(-7/6)\n\ny^3 = (2^(-9/24))^3=2^(-27/24)=2^(-9/8)\n\nz^2 = (2^(-10/24))^2=2^(-20/24)=2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiply them together:\n\nx^4 y^3 z^2=2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)\n\nCompute the exponents:\n\nLet me find a common denominator for the fractions. 6,8,6. The least common denominator is 24.\n\nConvert each:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nSum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8.\n\nSo x^4 y^3 z^2=2^(-25/8).\n\nTherefore, log\u2082(x^4 y^3 z^2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8))= -25/8.\n\nTaking absolute value: | -25/8 | =25/8.\n\nSo m=25, n=8. They are coprime. So m +n=25+8=33.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the exponents.\n\nx^4 is (2^(-7/24))^4=2^(-7/24 *4)=2^(-7/6). Correct.\n\ny^3: (2^(-9/24))^3=2^(-9/24 *3)=2^(-9/8). Correct.\n\nz^2: (2^(-10/24))^2=2^(-10/24 *2)=2^(-5/6). Correct.\n\nAdding exponents: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6).\n\nConvert all to 24 denominator:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8= -27/24\n\n-5/6= -20/24\n\nSum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8. Correct.\n\nSo log\u2082 is -25/8. Absolute value is 25/8. So m=25, n=8, sum 33.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n\nWe are given a system of logarithmic equations involving \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)| given a system of logarithmic equations. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem gives me three equations:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nI remember that log\u2082(a/b) = log\u2082a - log\u2082b. So maybe I can rewrite each equation using this property. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\nlog\u2082(x) - log\u2082(y) - log\u2082(z) = 1/2\n\nSecond equation:\nlog\u2082(y) - log\u2082(x) - log\u2082(z) = 1/3\n\nThird equation:\nlog\u2082(z) - log\u2082(x) - log\u2082(y) = 1/4\n\nHmm, okay, so now I have a system of three equations with three variables: log\u2082x, log\u2082y, log\u2082z. Let me denote these as variables to make it easier. Let's let a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z. Then the equations become:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nSo now I have a system:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nI need to solve for a, b, c. Then, once I have those, I can compute log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) as 4a + 3b + 2c, since log\u2082(x\u2074) = 4 log\u2082x, etc. The absolute value is just in case the result is negative, but I don't think it will be here because x, y, z are positive reals, so their logs should be real numbers, but maybe not necessarily positive. Wait, but the problem states they are positive, so logs are defined, but they could be negative. Hmm, okay, but let's see.\n\nSo let me write down the three equations again with a, b, c:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nI need to solve this system. Let's see how to do that.\n\nOne method is to add or subtract equations to eliminate variables. Let me try adding all three equations together to see if that helps.\n\nAdding equation 1, 2, and 3:\n\n(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\na - b - c -a + b - c -a - b + c\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na - a -a = -a\n\n-b + b - b = -b\n\n-c - c + c = -c\n\nSo altogether, -a - b - c = sum of the right side.\n\nWhat's the sum on the right: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's find a common denominator, which is 12.\n\n1/2 = 6/12\n\n1/3 = 4/12\n\n1/4 = 3/12\n\nSo total is 6 + 4 + 3 = 13/12\n\nSo we have:\n\n-a - b - c = 13/12\n\nBut wait, the left side is - (a + b + c) = 13/12\n\nSo a + b + c = -13/12\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So the sum of a, b, c is negative. That might be useful later.\n\nNow, let me see if I can find each variable. Let me try to express each variable in terms of the others.\n\nLooking back at the three equations:\n\nEquation 1: a = b + c + 1/2\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nMaybe substitute a from equation 1 into equations 2 and 3.\n\nFrom equation 1: a = b + c + 1/2\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n-(b + c + 1/2) + b - c = 1/3\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n- b - c - 1/2 + b - c = 1/3\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n(-b + b) = 0\n\n(-c - c) = -2c\n\nSo we have: -2c - 1/2 = 1/3\n\nSo, -2c = 1/3 + 1/2\n\nCompute 1/3 + 1/2:\n\nCommon denominator is 6: 2/6 + 3/6 = 5/6\n\nSo, -2c = 5/6\n\nTherefore, c = -(5/6) / 2 = -5/12\n\nSo c is -5/12.\n\nNow, let's substitute a from equation 1 into equation 3.\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nAgain, a = b + c + 1/2\n\nSo substitute:\n\n-(b + c + 1/2) - b + c = 1/4\n\nCompute:\n\n- b - c - 1/2 - b + c = 1/4\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-b - b) = -2b\n\n(-c + c) = 0\n\nSo: -2b - 1/2 = 1/4\n\nThen, -2b = 1/4 + 1/2\n\n1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4\n\nSo, -2b = 3/4\n\nThus, b = -(3/4) / 2 = -3/8\n\nSo b is -3/8.\n\nNow, from equation 1: a = b + c + 1/2\n\nWe have b = -3/8, c = -5/12\n\nSo a = (-3/8) + (-5/12) + 1/2\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, find a common denominator for 8 and 12, which is 24.\n\nConvert each term:\n\n-3/8 = -9/24\n\n-5/12 = -10/24\n\n1/2 = 12/24\n\nSo adding them together:\n\n-9/24 -10/24 +12/24 = (-19 +12)/24 = (-7)/24\n\nSo a = -7/24.\n\nSo, to recap, a = log\u2082x = -7/24\n\nb = log\u2082y = -3/8\n\nc = log\u2082z = -5/12\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)|. Let's compute that.\n\nlog\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z\n\nWhich is 4a + 3b + 2c.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6\n\n3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8\n\n2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = -5/6\n\nNow, sum these three terms:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nLet me find a common denominator for 6 and 8, which is 24.\n\nConvert each term:\n\n-7/6 = (-28)/24\n\n-9/8 = (-27)/24\n\n-5/6 = (-20)/24\n\nAdding them together: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify: -75/24. Let's see if this can be reduced.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: -25/8\n\nSo, log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = -25/8\n\nThe absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms since 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1.\n\nTherefore, m is 25, n is 8. So m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)| given a system of logarithmic equations. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem gives me three equations:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nI remember that log\u2082(a/b) = log\u2082a - log\u2082b. So maybe I can rewrite each equation using this property. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\nlog\u2082(x) - log\u2082(y) - log\u2082(z) = 1/2\n\nSecond equation:\nlog\u2082(y) - log\u2082(x) - log\u2082(z) = 1/3\n\nThird equation:\nlog\u2082(z) - log\u2082(x) - log\u2082(y) = 1/4\n\nHmm, okay, so now I have a system of three equations with three variables: log\u2082x, log\u2082y, log\u2082z. Let me denote these as variables to make it easier. Let's let a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z. Then the equations become:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nSo now I have a system:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nI need to solve for a, b, c. Then, once I have those, I can compute log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) as 4a + 3b + 2c, since log\u2082(x\u2074) = 4 log\u2082x, etc. The absolute value is just in case the result is negative, but I don't think it will be here because x, y, z are positive reals, so their logs should be real numbers, but maybe not necessarily positive. Wait, but the problem states they are positive, so logs are defined, but they could be negative. Hmm, okay, but let's see.\n\nSo let me write down the three equations again with a, b, c:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nI need to solve this system. Let's see how to do that.\n\nOne method is to add or subtract equations to eliminate variables. Let me try adding all three equations together to see if that helps.\n\nAdding equation 1, 2, and 3:\n\n(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\na - b - c -a + b - c -a - b + c\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na - a -a = -a\n\n-b + b - b = -b\n\n-c - c + c = -c\n\nSo altogether, -a - b - c = sum of the right side.\n\nWhat's the sum on the right: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's find a common denominator, which is 12.\n\n1/2 = 6/12\n\n1/3 = 4/12\n\n1/4 = 3/12\n\nSo total is 6 + 4 + 3 = 13/12\n\nSo we have:\n\n-a - b - c = 13/12\n\nBut wait, the left side is - (a + b + c) = 13/12\n\nSo a + b + c = -13/12\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So the sum of a, b, c is negative. That might be useful later.\n\nNow, let me see if I can find each variable. Let me try to express each variable in terms of the others.\n\nLooking back at the three equations:\n\nEquation 1: a = b + c + 1/2\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nMaybe substitute a from equation 1 into equations 2 and 3.\n\nFrom equation 1: a = b + c + 1/2\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n-(b + c + 1/2) + b - c = 1/3\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n- b - c - 1/2 + b - c = 1/3\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n(-b + b) = 0\n\n(-c - c) = -2c\n\nSo we have: -2c - 1/2 = 1/3\n\nSo, -2c = 1/3 + 1/2\n\nCompute 1/3 + 1/2:\n\nCommon denominator is 6: 2/6 + 3/6 = 5/6\n\nSo, -2c = 5/6\n\nTherefore, c = -(5/6) / 2 = -5/12\n\nSo c is -5/12.\n\nNow, let's substitute a from equation 1 into equation 3.\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nAgain, a = b + c + 1/2\n\nSo substitute:\n\n-(b + c + 1/2) - b + c = 1/4\n\nCompute:\n\n- b - c - 1/2 - b + c = 1/4\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-b - b) = -2b\n\n(-c + c) = 0\n\nSo: -2b - 1/2 = 1/4\n\nThen, -2b = 1/4 + 1/2\n\n1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4\n\nSo, -2b = 3/4\n\nThus, b = -(3/4) / 2 = -3/8\n\nSo b is -3/8.\n\nNow, from equation 1: a = b + c + 1/2\n\nWe have b = -3/8, c = -5/12\n\nSo a = (-3/8) + (-5/12) + 1/2\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, find a common denominator for 8 and 12, which is 24.\n\nConvert each term:\n\n-3/8 = -9/24\n\n-5/12 = -10/24\n\n1/2 = 12/24\n\nSo adding them together:\n\n-9/24 -10/24 +12/24 = (-19 +12)/24 = (-7)/24\n\nSo a = -7/24.\n\nSo, to recap, a = log\u2082x = -7/24\n\nb = log\u2082y = -3/8\n\nc = log\u2082z = -5/12\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)|. Let's compute that.\n\nlog\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z\n\nWhich is 4a + 3b + 2c.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6\n\n3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8\n\n2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = -5/6\n\nNow, sum these three terms:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nLet me find a common denominator for 6 and 8, which is 24.\n\nConvert each term:\n\n-7/6 = (-28)/24\n\n-9/8 = (-27)/24\n\n-5/6 = (-20)/24\n\nAdding them together: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify: -75/24. Let's see if this can be reduced.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: -25/8\n\nSo, log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = -25/8\n\nThe absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms since 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1.\n\nTherefore, m is 25, n is 8. So m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.\n\n\nTo solve the given system of logarithmic equations, we start by converting each equation using the property of logarithms:\n\n1. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\) becomes \\(a - b - c = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n2. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\) becomes \\(-a + b - c = \\frac{1}{3}\\)\n3. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\) becomes \\(-a - b + c = \\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\nHere, \\(a = \\log_2 x\\), \\(b = \\log_2 y\\), and \\(c = \\log_2 z\\). Adding all three equations gives:\n\n\\[\n(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n\\[\n-a - b - c = \\frac{13}{12}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(a + b + c = -\\frac{13}{12}\\). Substituting \\(a = b + c + \\frac{1}{2}\\) into the other equations, we solve for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\):\n\n1. Substituting into the second equation gives \\(c = -\\frac{5}{12}\\).\n2. Substituting into the third equation gives \\(b = -\\frac{3}{8}\\).\n\nFinally, substituting \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) into the expression for \\(a\\) gives \\(a = -\\frac{7}{24}\\).\n\nNow, we compute \\(\\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c\\):\n\n\\[\n4\\left(-\\frac{7}{24}\\right) + 3\\left(-\\frac{3}{8}\\right) + 2\\left(-\\frac{5}{12}\\right) = -\\frac{25}{8}\n\\]\n\nTaking the absolute value, we get \\(\\left|-\\frac{25}{8}\\right| = \\frac{25}{8}\\). Thus, \\(m = 25\\) and \\(n = 8\\), so \\(m + n = 33\\).\n\n\\boxed{33}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)| given a system of logarithmic equations. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that x, y, and z are positive real numbers. That's good because logarithms are only defined for positive numbers, so I don't have to worry about undefined expressions here.\n\nThe system of equations given is:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nAnd I need to find |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|, which simplifies to |4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z|. So, if I can find log\u2082x, log\u2082y, and log\u2082z individually, I can plug them into this expression and compute the result.\n\nLet me denote a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, and c = log\u2082z. This substitution might make the equations easier to handle.\n\nSo, rewriting the given equations using these variables:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n   Using logarithm properties, this becomes log\u2082x - log\u2082y - log\u2082z = 1/2\n   Which translates to a - b - c = 1/2.\n\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n   Similarly, this is log\u2082y - log\u2082x - log\u2082z = 1/3\n   So, b - a - c = 1/3.\n\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n   This becomes log\u2082z - log\u2082x - log\u2082y = 1/4\n   Which is c - a - b = 1/4.\n\nNow, I have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nLet me write these equations again for clarity:\n\nEquation (1): a - b - c = 1/2\nEquation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3\nEquation (3): -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nI need to solve this system. Maybe I can add all three equations together to see if that helps.\n\nAdding equation (1), (2), and (3):\n\n(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\na - b - c - a + b - c -a - b + c\nCombine like terms:\n\na terms: a - a - a = -a\nb terms: -b + b - b = -b\nc terms: -c - c + c = -c\n\nSo overall, -a - b - c = sum of the right side.\n\nCompute the right side:\n\n1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Let me find a common denominator, which is 12.\n\n1/2 = 6/12\n1/3 = 4/12\n1/4 = 3/12\nTotal: 6 + 4 + 3 = 13 \u2192 13/12.\n\nSo, left side is - (a + b + c) = 13/12 \u2192 a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nHmm, but I need to find a, b, c individually. Let me think about how to proceed.\n\nI have three equations and the sum of a + b + c. Maybe I can express each variable in terms of the sum.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nNow, let's look at the individual equations again.\n\nEquation (1): a - b - c = 1/2\nWe can write this as a - (b + c) = 1/2.\n\nBut since S = a + b + c = -13/12, then b + c = S - a = (-13/12) - a.\n\nSubstituting into Equation (1):\n\na - [(-13/12) - a] = 1/2\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\na - (-13/12) + a = 1/2\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n2a + 13/12 = 1/2\n\nSubtract 13/12 from both sides:\n\n2a = 1/2 - 13/12\n\nConvert 1/2 to 6/12:\n\n2a = 6/12 - 13/12 = (-7)/12\n\nSo, 2a = -7/12 \u2192 a = (-7)/24.\n\nHmm, so a = log\u2082x = -7/24. Interesting, that's negative, which means x is less than 1.\n\nOkay, let's write that down: a = -7/24.\n\nNow, let's move on to Equation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nAgain, using S = a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nFrom Equation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\n(-a) + (b - c) = 1/3.\n\nBut from S, b + c = (-13/12) - a. Wait, but I have b - c here. Maybe I can find another relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express b in terms of a and c, or something like that.\n\nWait, let me try to express b - c from Equation (2):\n\nFrom Equation (2): -a + (b - c) = 1/3 \u2192 b - c = 1/3 + a.\n\nBut a is known as -7/24.\n\nSo, b - c = 1/3 + (-7/24) = (8/24 - 7/24) = 1/24.\n\nSo, b - c = 1/24.\n\nSimilarly, from Equation (3): -a - b + c = 1/4.\n\nAgain, substitute a = -7/24:\n\n-(-7/24) - b + c = 1/4 \u2192 7/24 - b + c = 1/4.\n\nLet me write this as: -b + c = 1/4 - 7/24.\n\nConvert 1/4 to 6/24:\n\n- b + c = 6/24 -7/24 = (-1)/24.\n\nSo, -b + c = -1/24.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1. b - c = 1/24\n2. -b + c = -1/24\n\nLet me add these two equations together:\n\n(b - c) + (-b + c) = 1/24 + (-1/24)\n\nSimplify left side: 0 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's not helpful. They are dependent equations. So, I can't get unique values for b and c yet. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nWait, since I have b - c = 1/24 and from S, a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nWe already know a, so:\n\na + b + c = -13/12 \u2192 (-7/24) + b + c = -13/12.\n\nLet me compute -13/12 as -26/24 for easier calculation.\n\nSo:\n\n(-7/24) + b + c = -26/24 \u2192 b + c = (-26/24) + 7/24 = (-19)/24.\n\nSo, b + c = -19/24.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nb - c = 1/24\nb + c = -19/24\n\nNow, I can solve these two equations for b and c.\n\nLet me add them:\n\n(b - c) + (b + c) = 1/24 + (-19)/24 \u2192 2b = (-18)/24 \u2192 2b = (-3)/4 \u2192 b = (-3)/8.\n\nSo, b = log\u2082y = -3/8.\n\nNow, substitute b into one of the equations to find c. Let's use b + c = -19/24.\n\nSo, (-3/8) + c = -19/24.\n\nConvert -3/8 to -9/24:\n\n-9/24 + c = -19/24 \u2192 c = (-19/24) + 9/24 = (-10)/24 = (-5)/12.\n\nSo, c = log\u2082z = -5/12.\n\nAlright, so now I have:\n\na = log\u2082x = -7/24\n\nb = log\u2082y = -3/8\n\nc = log\u2082z = -5/12\n\nNow, the expression I need is |4a + 3b + 2c|.\n\nLet me compute 4a + 3b + 2c.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4a = 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6\n\n3b = 3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8\n\n2c = 2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nLet me find a common denominator for 6, 8, 6. The least common multiple is 24.\n\nConvert each term:\n\n-7/6 = (-28)/24\n\n-9/8 = (-27)/24\n\n-5/6 = (-20)/24\n\nSo, adding them:\n\n(-28) + (-27) + (-20) = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify:\n\n-75/24. Let me see if this can be reduced. 75 and 24 have a common factor of 3.\n\n75 \u00f7 3 = 25; 24 \u00f73 =8. So, -75/24 = -25/8.\n\nSo, 4a + 3b + 2c = -25/8.\n\nThe absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo, the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms since 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1.\n\nTherefore, m =25, n=8. m + n =25 +8=33.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nFirst, the system of equations after substitution:\n\na - b - c =1/2\n\n- a + b -c=1/3\n\n- a - b +c=1/4\n\nThen adding them gave me -a -b -c=13/12 \u2192 a + b +c= -13/12.\n\nThen, from equation (1): a - (b + c) =1/2. Since b +c = -13/12 -a, substituting gives:\n\na - (-13/12 -a) =1/2 \u2192 2a +13/12=1/2 \u2192 2a=1/2 -13/12= (6/12 -13/12)= -7/12 \u2192 a= -7/24. Correct.\n\nThen, equation (2): -a + b - c=1/3. Substituting a= -7/24, we get 7/24 + b -c=1/3.\n\nWait, wait, let me check this again.\n\nWait, equation (2) is: -a + b -c=1/3.\n\nSince a= -7/24, so -a=7/24.\n\nSo, 7/24 + b -c=1/3.\n\nConvert 1/3 to 8/24:\n\n7/24 + b -c=8/24 \u2192 b -c=1/24. Correct.\n\nEquation (3): -a -b +c=1/4.\n\nSubstituting a= -7/24, we get 7/24 -b +c=1/4.\n\nConvert 1/4 to 6/24:\n\n7/24 -b +c=6/24 \u2192 -b +c= -1/24. Correct.\n\nThen, from S= a +b +c= -13/12= -26/24.\n\nSo, a= -7/24, so b +c= -26/24 +7/24= -19/24. Correct.\n\nSo, equations:\n\nb -c=1/24\n\nb +c= -19/24\n\nAdding gives 2b= (-18)/24 \u2192 b= -9/24= -3/8. Correct.\n\nThen c= (-19/24) -b= (-19/24) - (-9/24)= (-10)/24= -5/12. Correct.\n\nThen, 4a +3b +2c:\n\n4*(-7/24)= -28/24= -7/6\n\n3*(-3/8)= -9/8\n\n2*(-5/12)= -10/12= -5/6\n\nSum: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n-28/24 -27/24 -20/24= (-75)/24= -25/8.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)| given a system of logarithmic equations. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that x, y, and z are positive real numbers. That's good because logarithms are only defined for positive numbers, so I don't have to worry about undefined expressions here.\n\nThe system of equations given is:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nAnd I need to find |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|, which simplifies to |4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z|. So, if I can find log\u2082x, log\u2082y, and log\u2082z individually, I can plug them into this expression and compute the result.\n\nLet me denote a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, and c = log\u2082z. This substitution might make the equations easier to handle.\n\nSo, rewriting the given equations using these variables:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n   Using logarithm properties, this becomes log\u2082x - log\u2082y - log\u2082z = 1/2\n   Which translates to a - b - c = 1/2.\n\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n   Similarly, this is log\u2082y - log\u2082x - log\u2082z = 1/3\n   So, b - a - c = 1/3.\n\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n   This becomes log\u2082z - log\u2082x - log\u2082y = 1/4\n   Which is c - a - b = 1/4.\n\nNow, I have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nLet me write these equations again for clarity:\n\nEquation (1): a - b - c = 1/2\nEquation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3\nEquation (3): -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nI need to solve this system. Maybe I can add all three equations together to see if that helps.\n\nAdding equation (1), (2), and (3):\n\n(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\na - b - c - a + b - c -a - b + c\nCombine like terms:\n\na terms: a - a - a = -a\nb terms: -b + b - b = -b\nc terms: -c - c + c = -c\n\nSo overall, -a - b - c = sum of the right side.\n\nCompute the right side:\n\n1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Let me find a common denominator, which is 12.\n\n1/2 = 6/12\n1/3 = 4/12\n1/4 = 3/12\nTotal: 6 + 4 + 3 = 13 \u2192 13/12.\n\nSo, left side is - (a + b + c) = 13/12 \u2192 a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nHmm, but I need to find a, b, c individually. Let me think about how to proceed.\n\nI have three equations and the sum of a + b + c. Maybe I can express each variable in terms of the sum.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nNow, let's look at the individual equations again.\n\nEquation (1): a - b - c = 1/2\nWe can write this as a - (b + c) = 1/2.\n\nBut since S = a + b + c = -13/12, then b + c = S - a = (-13/12) - a.\n\nSubstituting into Equation (1):\n\na - [(-13/12) - a] = 1/2\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\na - (-13/12) + a = 1/2\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n2a + 13/12 = 1/2\n\nSubtract 13/12 from both sides:\n\n2a = 1/2 - 13/12\n\nConvert 1/2 to 6/12:\n\n2a = 6/12 - 13/12 = (-7)/12\n\nSo, 2a = -7/12 \u2192 a = (-7)/24.\n\nHmm, so a = log\u2082x = -7/24. Interesting, that's negative, which means x is less than 1.\n\nOkay, let's write that down: a = -7/24.\n\nNow, let's move on to Equation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nAgain, using S = a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nFrom Equation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\n(-a) + (b - c) = 1/3.\n\nBut from S, b + c = (-13/12) - a. Wait, but I have b - c here. Maybe I can find another relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express b in terms of a and c, or something like that.\n\nWait, let me try to express b - c from Equation (2):\n\nFrom Equation (2): -a + (b - c) = 1/3 \u2192 b - c = 1/3 + a.\n\nBut a is known as -7/24.\n\nSo, b - c = 1/3 + (-7/24) = (8/24 - 7/24) = 1/24.\n\nSo, b - c = 1/24.\n\nSimilarly, from Equation (3): -a - b + c = 1/4.\n\nAgain, substitute a = -7/24:\n\n-(-7/24) - b + c = 1/4 \u2192 7/24 - b + c = 1/4.\n\nLet me write this as: -b + c = 1/4 - 7/24.\n\nConvert 1/4 to 6/24:\n\n- b + c = 6/24 -7/24 = (-1)/24.\n\nSo, -b + c = -1/24.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1. b - c = 1/24\n2. -b + c = -1/24\n\nLet me add these two equations together:\n\n(b - c) + (-b + c) = 1/24 + (-1/24)\n\nSimplify left side: 0 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's not helpful. They are dependent equations. So, I can't get unique values for b and c yet. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nWait, since I have b - c = 1/24 and from S, a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nWe already know a, so:\n\na + b + c = -13/12 \u2192 (-7/24) + b + c = -13/12.\n\nLet me compute -13/12 as -26/24 for easier calculation.\n\nSo:\n\n(-7/24) + b + c = -26/24 \u2192 b + c = (-26/24) + 7/24 = (-19)/24.\n\nSo, b + c = -19/24.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nb - c = 1/24\nb + c = -19/24\n\nNow, I can solve these two equations for b and c.\n\nLet me add them:\n\n(b - c) + (b + c) = 1/24 + (-19)/24 \u2192 2b = (-18)/24 \u2192 2b = (-3)/4 \u2192 b = (-3)/8.\n\nSo, b = log\u2082y = -3/8.\n\nNow, substitute b into one of the equations to find c. Let's use b + c = -19/24.\n\nSo, (-3/8) + c = -19/24.\n\nConvert -3/8 to -9/24:\n\n-9/24 + c = -19/24 \u2192 c = (-19/24) + 9/24 = (-10)/24 = (-5)/12.\n\nSo, c = log\u2082z = -5/12.\n\nAlright, so now I have:\n\na = log\u2082x = -7/24\n\nb = log\u2082y = -3/8\n\nc = log\u2082z = -5/12\n\nNow, the expression I need is |4a + 3b + 2c|.\n\nLet me compute 4a + 3b + 2c.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4a = 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6\n\n3b = 3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8\n\n2c = 2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nLet me find a common denominator for 6, 8, 6. The least common multiple is 24.\n\nConvert each term:\n\n-7/6 = (-28)/24\n\n-9/8 = (-27)/24\n\n-5/6 = (-20)/24\n\nSo, adding them:\n\n(-28) + (-27) + (-20) = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify:\n\n-75/24. Let me see if this can be reduced. 75 and 24 have a common factor of 3.\n\n75 \u00f7 3 = 25; 24 \u00f73 =8. So, -75/24 = -25/8.\n\nSo, 4a + 3b + 2c = -25/8.\n\nThe absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo, the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms since 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1.\n\nTherefore, m =25, n=8. m + n =25 +8=33.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nFirst, the system of equations after substitution:\n\na - b - c =1/2\n\n- a + b -c=1/3\n\n- a - b +c=1/4\n\nThen adding them gave me -a -b -c=13/12 \u2192 a + b +c= -13/12.\n\nThen, from equation (1): a - (b + c) =1/2. Since b +c = -13/12 -a, substituting gives:\n\na - (-13/12 -a) =1/2 \u2192 2a +13/12=1/2 \u2192 2a=1/2 -13/12= (6/12 -13/12)= -7/12 \u2192 a= -7/24. Correct.\n\nThen, equation (2): -a + b - c=1/3. Substituting a= -7/24, we get 7/24 + b -c=1/3.\n\nWait, wait, let me check this again.\n\nWait, equation (2) is: -a + b -c=1/3.\n\nSince a= -7/24, so -a=7/24.\n\nSo, 7/24 + b -c=1/3.\n\nConvert 1/3 to 8/24:\n\n7/24 + b -c=8/24 \u2192 b -c=1/24. Correct.\n\nEquation (3): -a -b +c=1/4.\n\nSubstituting a= -7/24, we get 7/24 -b +c=1/4.\n\nConvert 1/4 to 6/24:\n\n7/24 -b +c=6/24 \u2192 -b +c= -1/24. Correct.\n\nThen, from S= a +b +c= -13/12= -26/24.\n\nSo, a= -7/24, so b +c= -26/24 +7/24= -19/24. Correct.\n\nSo, equations:\n\nb -c=1/24\n\nb +c= -19/24\n\nAdding gives 2b= (-18)/24 \u2192 b= -9/24= -3/8. Correct.\n\nThen c= (-19/24) -b= (-19/24) - (-9/24)= (-10)/24= -5/12. Correct.\n\nThen, 4a +3b +2c:\n\n4*(-7/24)= -28/24= -7/6\n\n3*(-3/8)= -9/8\n\n2*(-5/12)= -10/12= -5/6\n\nSum: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n-28/24 -27/24 -20/24= (-75)/24= -25/8. Absolute value is 25/8. Correct.\n\nSo, m=25, n=8. Sum is 33.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here with three variables x, y, z, all positive real numbers. They satisfy a system of three logarithmic equations. I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.\n\nHmm, let's write down the equations first to get a clear picture.\n\nThe equations are:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nSo, these are logarithms base 2. Since logs can be tricky, maybe I can convert these into exponential form to make them easier to handle.\n\nRemember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.\n\nApplying that here:\n\n1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)\n2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)\n3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)\n\nSo, that gives me three equations:\n\n1. x = 2^(1/2) * y z\n2. y = 2^(1/3) * x z\n3. z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nHmm, these are nonlinear equations because x, y, z are multiplied together. Maybe I can express each variable in terms of the others and substitute.\n\nLet me denote 2^(1/2) as sqrt(2), 2^(1/3) as cube root of 2, and 2^(1/4) as fourth root of 2 for simplicity.\n\nSo, equation 1: x = sqrt(2) * y z\n\nEquation 2: y = (2^(1/3)) * x z\n\nEquation 3: z = (2^(1/4)) * x y\n\nHmm, perhaps I can substitute x from equation 1 into equation 2.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = sqrt(2) * y z.\n\nPlug this into equation 2:\n\ny = (2^(1/3)) * (sqrt(2) * y z) * z\n\nSimplify that:\n\ny = (2^(1/3) * sqrt(2)) * y z^2\n\nWait, sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6)\n\nSo, y = 2^(5/6) * y * z^2\n\nHmm, I can divide both sides by y, assuming y \u2260 0 (which it isn't since they're positive reals).\n\n1 = 2^(5/6) * z^2\n\nSo, z^2 = 1 / (2^(5/6)) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nTaking square roots:\n\nz = 2^(-5/12) since z is positive.\n\nWait, because sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12)\n\nOkay, so z is 2^(-5/12)\n\nAlright, that's a value for z. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nNow, let's go back to equation 1: x = sqrt(2) * y z.\n\nWe can write x in terms of y, since we know z.\n\nSimilarly, equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nWe can substitute x from equation 1 into equation 3.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to find expressions for x and y in terms of each other.\n\nWait, let's see. From equation 1, x = sqrt(2) * y * z. Since we know z, we can write x = sqrt(2) * y * (2^(-5/12)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(2) as 2^(1/2):\n\nx = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 - 5/12)\n\nCompute the exponent: 1/2 is 6/12, so 6/12 -5/12 = 1/12.\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nSo, x = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nAlright, so x is 2^(1/12) times y.\n\nNow, let's use equation 2: y = (2^(1/3)) * x z.\n\nWe can substitute x from above and z as we found.\n\nx = y * 2^(1/12), z = 2^(-5/12)\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * (y * 2^(1/12)) * (2^(-5/12))\n\nSimplify:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * y * (2^(1/12) * 2^(-5/12))\n\nCompute the exponents: 1/12 -5/12 = -4/12 = -1/3.\n\nSo, 2^(1/3) * 2^(-1/3) = 2^(0) = 1\n\nThus, equation simplifies to y = 1 * y, which is y = y. Hmm, that's just an identity, which means that perhaps the substitution didn't give us new information. So maybe I need another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should express x and y in terms of each other and substitute into equation 3.\n\nSo, equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nWe have z = 2^(-5/12), so:\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nWe can substitute x = y * 2^(1/12) into this.\n\nSo, 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * (y * 2^(1/12)) * y\n\nSimplify:\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * y^2 * 2^(1/12)\n\nCombine the exponents on 2:\n\n2^(1/4 + 1/12) = 2^(3/12 + 1/12) = 2^(4/12) = 2^(1/3)\n\nSo, 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/3) * y^2\n\nThus, y^2 = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/3) = 2^(-5/12 - 4/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nTherefore, y^2 = 2^(-3/4), so y = 2^(-3/8) since y is positive.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nThen, since x = y * 2^(1/12), x = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12)\n\nCompute the exponents:\n\nConvert to common denominator, 24:\n\n-3/8 = -9/24, 1/12 = 2/24\n\nSo, -9/24 + 2/24 = -7/24\n\nThus, x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nSo, now we have x, y, z in terms of exponents of 2.\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\ny = 2^(-3/8)\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nWait, let's check the exponents:\n\n-3/8 is equal to -9/24.\n\n-5/12 is equal to -10/24.\n\n-7/24 is as it is.\n\nWait, maybe we can write all exponents with denominator 24 for consistency.\n\nx: -7/24\n\ny: -9/24\n\nz: -10/24\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-10/24)\n\nAlternatively, we can write them as:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\n\ny = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24)\n\nz = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)\n\nNow, we need to compute |log\u2082(x^4 y^3 z^2)|\n\nFirst, compute x^4 y^3 z^2.\n\nSince x, y, z are powers of 2, their exponents will add up when multiplied.\n\nLet me compute the exponents:\n\nFor x^4: exponent is 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6\n\nFor y^3: exponent is 3*(-9/24) = -27/24 = -9/8\n\nFor z^2: exponent is 2*(-10/24) = -20/24 = -5/6\n\nSo, total exponent is:\n\n-7/6 + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nLet's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's combine the fractions with denominator 6 and 8.\n\nFind a common denominator for 6 and 8, which is 24.\n\nConvert each term:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nAdding them together:\n\n-28/24 -27/24 -20/24 = (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify -75/24: both divisible by 3.\n\n-75 \u00f7 3 = -25; 24 \u00f73 =8. So, -25/8.\n\nSo, x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-25/8)\n\nTherefore, log\u2082(x^4 y^3 z^2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8\n\nTaking the absolute value, | -25/8 | = 25/8\n\nSo, the value is 25/8.\n\nWait, 25 and 8 are coprime since 25 is 5\u00b2 and 8 is 2\u00b3. So, m=25, n=8, m +n=33.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the exponents:\n\nx^4: 4 * (-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6\n\ny^3: 3 * (-9/24) = (-27)/24 = -9/8\n\nz^2: 2 * (-10/24) = (-20)/24 = -5/6\n\nAdding: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nConvert all to 24ths:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nSum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8\n\nYes, that's correct. So log\u2082(...) is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8, which reduces to 25/8. So m=25, n=8, sum is 33.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap the steps to ensure no miscalculations.\n\n1.

I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.\n\nHmm, let's write down the equations first to get a clear picture.\n\nThe equations are:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nSo, these are logarithms base 2. Since logs can be tricky, maybe I can convert these into exponential form to make them easier to handle.\n\nRemember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.\n\nApplying that here:\n\n1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)\n2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)\n3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)\n\nSo, that gives me three equations:\n\n1. x = 2^(1/2) * y z\n2. y = 2^(1/3) * x z\n3. z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nHmm, these are nonlinear equations because x, y, z are multiplied together.

Hmm, let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the equations are:\n\n1. log\u2082(x/(yz)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y/(xz)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z/(xy)) = 1/4\n\nI remember that log\u2082(a/b) = log\u2082a - log\u2082b. So maybe I can rewrite each equation using that property.\n\nLet me rewrite each equation:\n\n1. log\u2082x - log\u2082y - log\u2082z = 1/2\n2. log\u2082y - log\u2082x - log\u2082z = 1/3\n3. log\u2082z - log\u2082x - log\u2082y = 1/4\n\nHmm, okay. So now I have three equations with variables log\u2082x, log\u2082y, and log\u2082z. Maybe I can let a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z. That should simplify things.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nNow I have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c. I can solve this system.\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2  --> Equation (1)\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3 --> Equation (2)\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4 --> Equation (3)\n\nI can try adding all three equations together to see what happens.\n\nEquation (1) + Equation (2) + Equation (3):\n\n(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\na - b - c - a + b - c -a - b + c\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\na -a -a = -a\n\n-b + b - b = -b\n\n-c -c + c = -c\n\nSo the left side is -a - b - c.\n\nThe right side is 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4.\n\nLet me compute that. Common denominator is 12.\n\n1/2 = 6/12, 1/3 = 4/12, 1/4 = 3/12. So 6 + 4 + 3 = 13, so 13/12.\n\nSo:\n\n-a - b - c = 13/12\n\nWhich means:\n\na + b + c = -13/12 --> Equation (4)\n\nOkay, that's one equation. Now I need two more to solve for a, b, c. Maybe I can subtract equations or find other combinations.\n\nLet me try subtracting Equation (2) from Equation (1):\n\nEquation (1) - Equation (2):\n\n(a - b - c) - (-a + b - c) = 1/2 - 1/3\n\nSimplify left side:\n\na - b - c + a - b + c = 2a - 2b\n\nRight side: 1/2 - 1/3 = (3 - 2)/6 = 1/6\n\nSo:\n\n2a - 2b = 1/6\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\na - b = 1/12 --> Equation (5)\n\nSimilarly, maybe subtract Equation (3) from Equation (1):\n\nEquation (1) - Equation (3):\n\n(a - b - c) - (-a - b + c) = 1/2 - 1/4\n\nLeft side:\n\na - b - c + a + b - c = 2a - 2c\n\nRight side: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4\n\nSo:\n\n2a - 2c = 1/4\n\nDivide by 2:\n\na - c = 1/8 --> Equation (6)\n\nNow I have Equation (5): a - b = 1/12 and Equation (6): a - c = 1/8.\n\nAnd Equation (4): a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nLet me see if I can express b and c in terms of a.\n\nFrom Equation (5): b = a - 1/12\n\nFrom Equation (6): c = a - 1/8\n\nNow substitute these into Equation (4):\n\na + (a - 1/12) + (a - 1/8) = -13/12\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na + a + a = 3a\n\nConstants: -1/12 -1/8\n\nLet me find a common denominator for 12 and 8, which is 24.\n\n-1/12 = -2/24\n\n-1/8 = -3/24\n\nSo total constants: -2/24 -3/24 = -5/24\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n3a - 5/24 = -13/12\n\nLet me solve for a:\n\n3a = -13/12 + 5/24\n\nConvert -13/12 to 24ths: -26/24\n\nSo 3a = (-26 +5)/24 = (-21)/24 = -7/8\n\nHence, a = (-7/8) /3 = (-7)/(24)\n\nSo a = -7/24\n\nNow find b and c.\n\nFrom Equation (5): b = a - 1/12 = (-7/24) - (2/24) = (-9/24) = -3/8\n\nFrom Equation (6): c = a - 1/8 = (-7/24) - (3/24) = (-10/24) = -5/12\n\nSo, a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.\n\nSo, since a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z.\n\nSo x = 2^a = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^b = 2^(-3/8), z = 2^c = 2^(-5/12).\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)|.\n\nLet me compute log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2). Using logarithm properties, that's 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z.\n\nWhich is 4a + 3b + 2c.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6\n\n3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8\n\n2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6\n\nNow sum them:\n\n(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nFirst, combine -7/6 and -5/6: (-7 -5)/6 = (-12)/6 = -2\n\nSo now we have -2 + (-9/8) = -2 -9/8\n\nConvert -2 to eighths: -16/8\n\nSo -16/8 -9/8 = (-25)/8\n\nSo log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = (-25)/8\n\nTaking the absolute value: |(-25)/8| = 25/8\n\nSo 25 and 8 are coprime, so m=25, n=8, m+n=33.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nLet me recalculate 4a +3b +2c:\n\na = -7/24, so 4a = -28/24 = -7/6 \u2248 -1.1667\n\nb = -3/8, so 3b = -9/8 \u2248 -1.125\n\nc = -5/12, so 2c = -10/12 = -5/6 \u2248 -0.8333\n\nAdding them: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nConvert to 24 denominators:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nTotal: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8\n\nYes, that's correct. So absolute value is 25/8, which reduces to 25/8. So m=25, n=8. m+n=33.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)| given a system of logarithmic equations. Hmm, let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the equations are:\n\n1. log\u2082(x/(yz)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y/(xz)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z/(xy)) = 1/4\n\nI remember that log\u2082(a/b) = log\u2082a - log\u2082b. So maybe I can rewrite each equation using that property.\n\nLet me rewrite each equation:\n\n1. log\u2082x - log\u2082y - log\u2082z = 1/2\n2. log\u2082y - log\u2082x - log\u2082z = 1/3\n3. log\u2082z - log\u2082x - log\u2082y = 1/4\n\nHmm, okay. So now I have three equations with variables log\u2082x, log\u2082y, and log\u2082z. Maybe I can let a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z. That should simplify things.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nNow I have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c. I can solve this system.\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2  --> Equation (1)\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3 --> Equation (2)\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4 --> Equation (3)\n\nI can try adding all three equations together to see what happens.\n\nEquation (1) + Equation (2) + Equation (3):\n\n(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\na - b - c - a + b - c -a - b + c\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\na -a -a = -a\n\n-b + b - b = -b\n\n-c -c + c = -c\n\nSo the left side is -a - b - c.\n\nThe right side is 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4.\n\nLet me compute that. Common denominator is 12.\n\n1/2 = 6/12, 1/3 = 4/12, 1/4 = 3/12. So 6 + 4 + 3 = 13, so 13/12.\n\nSo:\n\n-a - b - c = 13/12\n\nWhich means:\n\na + b + c = -13/12 --> Equation (4)\n\nOkay, that's one equation. Now I need two more to solve for a, b, c.

Using logarithm properties, that's 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z.\n\nWhich is 4a + 3b + 2c.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6\n\n3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8\n\n2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6\n\nNow sum them:\n\n(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nFirst, combine -7/6 and -5/6: (-7 -5)/6 = (-12)/6 = -2\n\nSo now we have -2 + (-9/8) = -2 -9/8\n\nConvert -2 to eighths: -16/8\n\nSo -16/8 -9/8 = (-25)/8\n\nSo log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = (-25)/8\n\nTaking the absolute value: |(-25)/8| = 25/8\n\nSo 25 and 8 are coprime, so m=25, n=8, m+n=33.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nLet me recalculate 4a +3b +2c:\n\na = -7/24, so 4a = -28/24 = -7/6 \u2248 -1.1667\n\nb = -3/8, so 3b = -9/8 \u2248 -1.125\n\nc = -5/12, so 2c = -10/12 = -5/6 \u2248 -0.8333\n\nAdding them: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nConvert to 24 denominators:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nTotal: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8\n\nYes, that's correct. So absolute value is 25/8, which reduces to 25/8.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here with logarithms and variables x, y, z. Let me try to unpack it step by step. \n\nThe problem states that x, y, and z are positive real numbers, and they satisfy a system of three logarithmic equations. The goal is to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2), which will be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nAlright, let's write down the equations first to have them clear:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nHmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite each equation in exponential form to make them easier to handle.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\nlog\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n\nThis means that 2^(1/2) = x / (y z). Simplifying 2^(1/2) is \u221a2, so:\n\n\u221a2 = x / (y z) \u2192 x = \u221a2 * y z  ...(1)\n\nSimilarly, the second equation:\n\nlog\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3 \u2192 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)\n\nSo, y = 2^(1/3) * x z  ...(2)\n\nAnd the third equation:\n\nlog\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4 \u2192 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)\n\nSo, z = 2^(1/4) * x y  ...(3)\n\nNow, I have three equations:\n\n1. x = \u221a2 * y z\n2. y = 2^(1/3) * x z\n3. z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nHmm, so each variable is expressed in terms of the other two. This looks like a system of equations that might be cyclic. Maybe I can substitute each equation into the others to find expressions for x, y, z in terms of each other.\n\nLet me try substituting equation (2) into equation (1):\n\nFrom equation (1), x = \u221a2 * y z\n\nBut y from equation (2) is y = 2^(1/3) * x z. So substitute that in:\n\nx = \u221a2 * (2^(1/3) * x z) * z\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= \u221a2 * 2^(1/3) * x * z\u00b2\n\nWait, that's x on both sides. Let me write it as:\n\nx = \u221a2 * 2^(1/3) * x * z\u00b2\n\nHmm, so if I divide both sides by x (since x is positive, it's non-zero), we get:\n\n1 = \u221a2 * 2^(1/3) * z\u00b2\n\nLet me compute \u221a2 * 2^(1/3). Since \u221a2 is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) = 2^(1/2 + 1/3) = 2^(5/6). So,\n\n1 = 2^(5/6) * z\u00b2\n\nThen, z\u00b2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nSo, taking square roots,\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)   (since square root is exponent 1/2, so -5/6 * 1/2 = -5/12)\n\nWait, but z is positive, so that's fine. So z = 2^(-5/12)\n\nOkay, so z is expressed. Let me note that down.\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nNow, with z known, let's go back to equation (3) to find y.\n\nFrom equation (3):\n\nz = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nWe can rearrange this to find y:\n\ny = z / (2^(1/4) * x)\n\nBut we know z is 2^(-5/12), so:\n\ny = [2^(-5/12)] / [2^(1/4) * x]\n\nLet me simplify the exponents. 2^(1/4) is 2^(3/12), so:\n\nDenominator exponent: 3/12, numerator exponent: -5/12\n\nSo, 2^(-5/12) / 2^(3/12) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo,\n\ny = 2^(-2/3) / x\n\nHmm, but I still have x in the denominator. Maybe I can find x in terms of z and then substitute.\n\nWait, let's go back to equation (1):\n\nx = \u221a2 * y z\n\nWe have y = 2^(-2/3) / x and z = 2^(-5/12). Substitute these into equation (1):\n\nx = \u221a2 * [2^(-2/3) / x] * [2^(-5/12)]\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\n\u221a2 is 2^(1/2). So,\n\nx = 2^(1/2) * 2^(-2/3) * 2^(-5/12) / x\n\nCombine exponents in the numerator:\n\n1/2 - 2/3 -5/12\n\nLet me convert all to twelfths:\n\n1/2 = 6/12\n\n2/3 = 8/12\n\n5/12 is as is.\n\nSo,\n\n6/12 - 8/12 -5/12 = (6 -8 -5)/12 = (-7)/12\n\nSo,\n\nx = 2^(-7/12) / x\n\nMultiply both sides by x:\n\nx\u00b2 = 2^(-7/12)\n\nTake square root:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\n\nWait, because sqrt(2^(-7/12)) is 2^(-7/24). Since x is positive, we take the positive root.\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nNow, knowing x, let's find y.\n\nFrom earlier, y = 2^(-2/3) / x = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(-7/24)\n\nDividing exponents: subtract exponents.\n\n-2/3 is equal to -16/24, so:\n\n-16/24 - (-7/24) = (-16 +7)/24 = (-9)/24 = -3/8\n\nSo,\n\ny = 2^(-3/8)\n\nWait, let me check that again. Hmm, wait, if y = 2^(-2/3) / x, and x is 2^(-7/24), then:\n\ny = 2^(-2/3) * 2^(7/24) = 2^(-2/3 +7/24)\n\nConvert to 24ths:\n\n-2/3 = -16/24, so -16/24 +7/24 = -9/24 = -3/8.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nNow, let's recap what we have:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\n\ny = 2^(-3/8)\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nLet me write all exponents with denominator 24 to make it easier:\n\nx exponent: -7/24\n\ny exponent: -3/8 = -9/24\n\nz exponent: -5/12 = -10/24\n\nSo,\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\n\ny = 2^(-9/24)\n\nz = 2^(-10/24)\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|.\n\nLet me compute the exponent first:\n\nx\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 in terms of exponents:\n\nFor x\u2074: exponent is 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6\n\nFor y\u00b3: exponent is 3*(-9/24) = -27/24 = -9/8\n\nFor z\u00b2: exponent is 2*(-10/24) = -20/24 = -5/6\n\nAdding all together:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nLet me find a common denominator, which would be 24.\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nAdding them:\n\n-28 -27 -20 = -75\n\nSo total exponent is -75/24\n\nSimplify:\n\n-75/24 = -25/8\n\nWait, 75 \u00f7 3 is 25, 24 \u00f73 is 8.\n\nSo, the exponent is -25/8.\n\nSo, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8)\n\nTaking log base 2:\n\nlog\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = -25/8\n\nThe absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8\n\nSo, m is 25, n is 8. They are coprime because 25 is 5\u00b2 and 8 is 2\u00b3, no common factors.\n\nThus, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting with the equations, converting logs to exponents correctly.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here with logarithms and variables x, y, z. Let me try to unpack it step by step. \n\nThe problem states that x, y, and z are positive real numbers, and they satisfy a system of three logarithmic equations. The goal is to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2), which will be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nAlright, let's write down the equations first to have them clear:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nHmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite each equation in exponential form to make them easier to handle.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\nlog\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n\nThis means that 2^(1/2) = x / (y z). Simplifying 2^(1/2) is \u221a2, so:\n\n\u221a2 = x / (y z) \u2192 x = \u221a2 * y z  ...(1)\n\nSimilarly, the second equation:\n\nlog\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3 \u2192 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)\n\nSo, y = 2^(1/3) * x z  ...(2)\n\nAnd the third equation:\n\nlog\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4 \u2192 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)\n\nSo, z = 2^(1/4) * x y  ...(3)\n\nNow, I have three equations:\n\n1. x = \u221a2 * y z\n2. y = 2^(1/3) * x z\n3. z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nHmm, so each variable is expressed in terms of the other two. This looks like a system of equations that might be cyclic. Maybe I can substitute each equation into the others to find expressions for x, y, z in terms of each other.\n\nLet me try substituting equation (2) into equation (1):\n\nFrom equation (1), x = \u221a2 * y z\n\nBut y from equation (2) is y = 2^(1/3) * x z. So substitute that in:\n\nx = \u221a2 * (2^(1/3) * x z) * z\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= \u221a2 * 2^(1/3) * x * z\u00b2\n\nWait, that's x on both sides. Let me write it as:\n\nx = \u221a2 * 2^(1/3) * x * z\u00b2\n\nHmm, so if I divide both sides by x (since x is positive, it's non-zero), we get:\n\n1 = \u221a2 * 2^(1/3) * z\u00b2\n\nLet me compute \u221a2 * 2^(1/3). Since \u221a2 is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) = 2^(1/2 + 1/3) = 2^(5/6). So,\n\n1 = 2^(5/6) * z\u00b2\n\nThen, z\u00b2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nSo, taking square roots,\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)   (since square root is exponent 1/2, so -5/6 * 1/2 = -5/12)\n\nWait, but z is positive, so that's fine. So z = 2^(-5/12)\n\nOkay, so z is expressed. Let me note that down.\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nNow, with z known, let's go back to equation (3) to find y.\n\nFrom equation (3):\n\nz = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nWe can rearrange this to find y:\n\ny = z / (2^(1/4) * x)\n\nBut we know z is 2^(-5/12), so:\n\ny = [2^(-5/12)] / [2^(1/4) * x]\n\nLet me simplify the exponents. 2^(1/4) is 2^(3/12), so:\n\nDenominator exponent: 3/12, numerator exponent: -5/12\n\nSo, 2^(-5/12) / 2^(3/12) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo,\n\ny = 2^(-2/3) / x\n\nHmm, but I still have x in the denominator. Maybe I can find x in terms of z and then substitute.\n\nWait, let's go back to equation (1):\n\nx = \u221a2 * y z\n\nWe have y = 2^(-2/3) / x and z = 2^(-5/12). Substitute these into equation (1):\n\nx = \u221a2 * [2^(-2/3) / x] * [2^(-5/12)]\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\n\u221a2 is 2^(1/2). So,\n\nx = 2^(1/2) * 2^(-2/3) * 2^(-5/12) / x\n\nCombine exponents in the numerator:\n\n1/2 - 2/3 -5/12\n\nLet me convert all to twelfths:\n\n1/2 = 6/12\n\n2/3 = 8/12\n\n5/12 is as is.\n\nSo,\n\n6/12 - 8/12 -5/12 = (6 -8 -5)/12 = (-7)/12\n\nSo,\n\nx = 2^(-7/12) / x\n\nMultiply both sides by x:\n\nx\u00b2 = 2^(-7/12)\n\nTake square root:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\n\nWait, because sqrt(2^(-7/12)) is 2^(-7/24). Since x is positive, we take the positive root.\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nNow, knowing x, let's find y.\n\nFrom earlier, y = 2^(-2/3) / x = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(-7/24)\n\nDividing exponents: subtract exponents.\n\n-2/3 is equal to -16/24, so:\n\n-16/24 - (-7/24) = (-16 +7)/24 = (-9)/24 = -3/8\n\nSo,\n\ny = 2^(-3/8)\n\nWait, let me check that again. Hmm, wait, if y = 2^(-2/3) / x, and x is 2^(-7/24), then:\n\ny = 2^(-2/3) * 2^(7/24) = 2^(-2/3 +7/24)\n\nConvert to 24ths:\n\n-2/3 = -16/24, so -16/24 +7/24 = -9/24 = -3/8.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nNow, let's recap what we have:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\n\ny = 2^(-3/8)\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nLet me write all exponents with denominator 24 to make it easier:\n\nx exponent: -7/24\n\ny exponent: -3/8 = -9/24\n\nz exponent: -5/12 = -10/24\n\nSo,\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\n\ny = 2^(-9/24)\n\nz = 2^(-10/24)\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|.\n\nLet me compute the exponent first:\n\nx\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 in terms of exponents:\n\nFor x\u2074: exponent is 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6\n\nFor y\u00b3: exponent is 3*(-9/24) = -27/24 = -9/8\n\nFor z\u00b2: exponent is 2*(-10/24) = -20/24 = -5/6\n\nAdding all together:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nLet me find a common denominator, which would be 24.\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nAdding them:\n\n-28 -27 -20 = -75\n\nSo total exponent is -75/24\n\nSimplify:\n\n-75/24 = -25/8\n\nWait, 75 \u00f7 3 is 25, 24 \u00f73 is 8.\n\nSo, the exponent is -25/8.\n\nSo, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8)\n\nTaking log base 2:\n\nlog\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = -25/8\n\nThe absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8\n\nSo, m is 25, n is 8.

Let's compute this again.\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24\n\n-9/8 = -27/24\n\n-5/6 = -20/24\n\nSum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8. Yes, correct.\n\nSo the log is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8.
