      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC. The triangle is inscribed in a circle \u03c9, and there are some tangents and intersections involved. Let me try to visualize and break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that ABC is a triangle with sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle \u03c9 is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. That means all three vertices lie on \u03c9.\n\nNext, the tangents to \u03c9 at points B and C intersect at point D. I remember that the tangent to a circle at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, if I can find the center of \u03c9, then the lines from the center to B and C will be perpendicular to the tangents at B and C, respectively.\n\nPoint D is where these two tangents meet. So, D is the ex-pole or something related to the tangents. I think this point is called the exsimilicenter or something else? Wait, no, the exsimilicenter is related to similar triangles... Hmm, maybe I should just proceed step by step.\n\nThe line AD is drawn, and it intersects \u03c9 again at point P. So, starting from A, drawing a line through D, which is outside the circle, and it intersects the circle again at P. So, AP is the segment from A to P, and we're supposed to find its length.\n\nGiven that, the problem wants AP expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then m + n. Okay.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Find the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC. I might need its radius or something else.\n\n2. Find point D, the intersection of the tangents at B and C.\n\n3. Find the equation of line AD and find its intersection point P with \u03c9 (other than A).\n\n4. Compute the distance from A to P.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a theorem or a property that can relate AP directly without going through all these steps. Let me think.\n\nWait, I remember that the power of a point can be useful here. The power of point D with respect to \u03c9 should be equal to the square of the length of the tangent from D to \u03c9. Since D lies on the tangents at B and C, the power of D is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2.\n\nAlso, since AD is a secant that intersects \u03c9 at A and P, the power of D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DA * DP. So, we have:\n\nDB\u00b2 = DA * DP.\n\nThat's a key equation. So, if I can find DB and DA, I can solve for DP, and then find AP.\n\nBut wait, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is DA + AP? Wait, no. Because P is on \u03c9, and A is also on \u03c9. So, AD is a secant line that starts at A, goes through D, and intersects \u03c9 again at P. So, the length from A to P is AP, and from D to P is DP. But since D is outside the circle, the power of point formula is:\n\nDB\u00b2 = DA * DP.\n\nBut DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. So, DP = DA + AP? Wait, no, because D is outside the circle, and P is the second intersection point. So, actually, DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. So, the entire length from D to A is DA, and from D to P is DP, but since A is on the circle, the power of point D is DA * DP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to the square of the tangent from D to \u03c9, which is DB\u00b2 (since DB is a tangent). Also, the power is equal to DA * DP because AD is a secant intersecting the circle at A and P. So:\n\nDB\u00b2 = DA * DP.\n\nBut DP is the distance from D to P, which is DA + AP, since P is beyond A from D's perspective. Wait, no. If you imagine point D outside the circle, line DA passes through A and then goes into the circle to point P. So, the distance from D to A is DA, and from D to P is DP. So, DP = DA + AP? Or is AP = DP - DA?\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let's say D is outside the circle, and line AD passes through A (on the circle) and then intersects the circle again at P. So, the length from D to A is DA, and from A to P is AP. So, the total length from D to P is DA + AP. So, DP = DA + AP. Therefore, the power of point D is DA * DP = DA * (DA + AP) = DB\u00b2.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nDA * (DA + AP) = DB\u00b2.\n\nSo, if I can find DA and DB, then I can solve for AP.\n\nBut I don't know DA or DB yet. So, I need to find expressions for DA and DB.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the ratio of AP to PD or something. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry. Let me consider placing the triangle in a coordinate system to compute the necessary lengths.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let's place point C at the origin (0,0). Then, point A is at (10,0) because AC=10. Point B is somewhere in the plane. We know AB=5 and BC=9.\n\nSo, coordinates:\n\nC = (0,0)\n\nA = (10,0)\n\nB = (x,y), which we need to find.\n\nWe can compute the coordinates of B using the distances.\n\nGiven AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC=10.\n\nSo, from point A (10,0) to point B (x,y): distance is 5.\n\nFrom point C (0,0) to point B (x,y): distance is 9.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\u221a[(x - 10)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = 5 \u2192 (x - 10)^2 + y^2 = 25 ...(1)\n\n\u221a[(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = 9 \u2192 x^2 + y^2 = 81 ...(2)\n\nSubtracting equation (1) from (2):\n\nx^2 + y^2 - [(x - 10)^2 + y^2] = 81 - 25\n\nx^2 - (x^2 - 20x + 100) = 56\n\nx^2 - x^2 + 20x - 100 = 56\n\n20x - 100 = 56 \u2192 20x = 156 \u2192 x = 156 / 20 = 39/5 = 7.8\n\nSo, x = 39/5.\n\nPlugging back into equation (2):\n\n(39/5)^2 + y^2 = 81\n\n(1521/25) + y^2 = 81\n\ny^2 = 81 - (1521/25) = (2025/25) - (1521/25) = (504)/25\n\nSo, y = \u221a(504/25) = (\u221a504)/5 = (\u221a(16*31.5))/5 \u2192 Wait, 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 16*31 is 496, 16*31.5=504. So, \u221a504 = \u221a(16*31.5) = 4\u221a31.5. But 31.5 is 63/2, so \u221a(63/2). Hmm, maybe better to write as \u221a504 = \u221a(4*126) = 2\u221a126. 126 factors into 9*14, so \u221a126 = 3\u221a14. So, \u221a504 = 2*3\u221a14 = 6\u221a14. So, y = 6\u221a14 /5.\n\nTherefore, point B is at (39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo, coordinates:\n\nA = (10,0)\n\nB = (39/5, 6\u221a14/5)\n\nC = (0,0)\n\nNow, I need to find the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC. To find the equation of \u03c9, I can find the circumradius and the center.\n\nAlternatively, since I have coordinates, I can find the equation of the circle passing through A, B, and C.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0.\n\nSince point C (0,0) lies on the circle:\n\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 \u2192 F = 0.\n\nSo, the equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey = 0.\n\nNow, plug in point A (10,0):\n\n10\u00b2 + 0 + D*10 + E*0 = 0 \u2192 100 + 10D = 0 \u2192 10D = -100 \u2192 D = -10.\n\nSo, equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey = 0.\n\nNow, plug in point B (39/5, 6\u221a14/5):\n\n(39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5) = 0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25.\n\n(6\u221a14/5)^2 = (36*14)/25 = 504/25.\n\n-10*(39/5) = -78.\n\nSo,\n\n1521/25 + 504/25 -78 + (6\u221a14 E)/5 = 0.\n\nAdding the fractions:\n\n(1521 + 504)/25 = 2025/25 = 81.\n\nSo, 81 -78 + (6\u221a14 E)/5 = 0 \u2192 3 + (6\u221a14 E)/5 = 0.\n\nSo,\n\n(6\u221a14 E)/5 = -3 \u2192 6\u221a14 E = -15 \u2192 E = (-15)/(6\u221a14) = (-5)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing the denominator:\n\nE = (-5\u221a14)/(2*14) = (-5\u221a14)/28.\n\nSo, the equation of the circle is:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nNow, I need to find the tangents at B and C.\n\nWait, the tangent at C is easy because C is at (0,0). The tangent at C to circle \u03c9.\n\nThe equation of the tangent at a point (x1, y1) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is given by:\n\nxx1 + yy1 + (D(x + x1))/2 + (E(y + y1))/2 + F = 0.\n\nSince F=0, the equation simplifies.\n\nFor point C (0,0):\n\nThe tangent equation is:\n\nx*0 + y*0 + D(x + 0)/2 + E(y + 0)/2 + 0 = 0 \u2192 D x /2 + E y /2 = 0.\n\nSubstituting D = -10, E = -5\u221a14/28:\n\n(-10/2) x + (-5\u221a14/28)/2 y = 0 \u2192 -5x - (5\u221a14/56)y = 0.\n\nWait, let me compute that again:\n\nD = -10, so D/2 = -5.\n\nE = (-5\u221a14)/28, so E/2 = (-5\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo, the tangent at C is:\n\n-5x - (5\u221a14/56)y = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 56 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-280x -5\u221a14 y = 0 \u2192 280x +5\u221a14 y = 0.\n\nBut let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, since the tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC, where O is the center of the circle.\n\nWait, the center of the circle is at ( -D/2, -E/2 ). Since the general equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0, the center is at (-D/2, -E/2).\n\nSo, D=-10, E= (-5\u221a14)/28.\n\nThus, center O is at (5, (5\u221a14)/56).\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\nCenter O is at (-D/2, -E/2) = (10/2, (5\u221a14)/56 ) = (5, (5\u221a14)/56 ).\n\nSo, the radius OC is the distance from O to C (0,0):\n\n\u221a(5\u00b2 + (5\u221a14/56)^2 ) = \u221a(25 + (25*14)/(56\u00b2)).\n\nSimplify denominator: 56\u00b2 = 3136.\n\nSo, (25*14)/3136 = 350/3136 = 25/224.\n\nSo, radius squared is 25 + 25/224 = (25*224 +25)/224 = (25*(224+1))/224 = 25*225 /224 = 5625/224.\n\nSo, radius is \u221a(5625/224) = 75/\u221a224 = 75\u221a224 / 224. But maybe we don't need the exact value right now.\n\nSo, the tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC. The slope of OC is ( (5\u221a14/56) - 0 ) / (5 - 0) ) = (5\u221a14/56)/5 = \u221a14/56.\n\nSo, slope of OC is \u221a14/56. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is the negative reciprocal, which is -56/\u221a14.\n\nSimplify: -56/\u221a14 = -56\u221a14 /14 = -4\u221a14.\n\nSo, the tangent at C has slope -4\u221a14 and passes through C (0,0). So, its equation is y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSimilarly, let's find the tangent at B.\n\nPoint B is (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). The radius OB is the line from O (5, 5\u221a14/56) to B (39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nCompute the slope of OB:\n\nSlope = (6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56 ) / (39/5 -5).\n\nConvert to common denominators:\n\nNumerator: (6\u221a14/5) - (5\u221a14/56) = (6\u221a14 *56 -5\u221a14 *5 ) / (5*56) = (336\u221a14 -25\u221a14)/280 = (311\u221a14)/280.\n\nDenominator: 39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5 =14/5.\n\nSo, slope is (311\u221a14/280) / (14/5) = (311\u221a14/280) * (5/14) = (311\u221a14 *5 )/(280*14 ) = (1555\u221a14 )/(3920 ) = Simplify numerator and denominator by 5: 311\u221a14 / 784.\n\nSo, the slope of OB is 311\u221a14 /784.\n\nThus, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal: -784/(311\u221a14 ).\n\nSimplify: -784/(311\u221a14 ) = multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\n-784\u221a14 / (311*14 ) = -784\u221a14 / 4354.\n\nSimplify 784 and 4354: 784 divides by 14: 784 = 14*56; 4354 /14= 4354 \u00f714= 311.\n\nSo, it's -56\u221a14 /311.\n\nSo, the tangent at B has slope -56\u221a14 /311 and passes through B (39/5,6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo, equation is:\n\ny - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14 /311)(x - 39/5).\n\nNow, point D is the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.\n\nWe already have the tangent at C: y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSo, let's substitute y = -4\u221a14 x into the equation of the tangent at B.\n\nSo:\n\n-4\u221a14 x - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14 /311)(x - 39/5).\n\nMultiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n311*(-4\u221a14 x - 6\u221a14/5 ) = -56\u221a14 (x - 39/5).\n\nExpand both sides:\n\nLeft side: 311*(-4\u221a14 x) + 311*(-6\u221a14/5) = -1244\u221a14 x - (1866\u221a14)/5.\n\nRight side: -56\u221a14 x + (56\u221a14 *39)/5 = -56\u221a14 x + (2184\u221a14)/5.\n\nNow, bring all terms to left side:\n\n-1244\u221a14 x - (1866\u221a14)/5 +56\u221a14 x - (2184\u221a14)/5 =0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-1244\u221a14 +56\u221a14 )x + (-1866\u221a14 -2184\u221a14)/5 =0.\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\n-1244\u221a14 +56\u221a14 = (-1244 +56)\u221a14 = (-1188)\u221a14.\n\n-1866\u221a14 -2184\u221a14 = (-4050\u221a14 ).\n\nSo:\n\n-1188\u221a14 x - (4050\u221a14)/5 =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a14:\n\n-1188 x - 4050/5 =0 \u2192 -1188x -810=0.\n\nSolving for x:\n\n-1188x =810 \u2192 x= -810/1188.\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 9: 810/9=90, 1188/9=132.\n\nSo, x= -90/132.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 6: 90/6=15, 132/6=22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nNow, substitute x into y = -4\u221a14 x:\n\ny= -4\u221a14*(-15/22)= (60\u221a14)/22= (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo, point D is at ( -15/22, 30\u221a14 /11 ).\n\nNow, I need to find the equation of line AD, which connects point A (10,0) and D (-15/22, 30\u221a14 /11 ).\n\nCompute the slope of AD:\n\nSlope m = (30\u221a14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10 ) = (30\u221a14/11 ) / ( (-15/22 -220/22 ) ) = (30\u221a14/11 ) / (-235/22 ) = (30\u221a14/11 ) * (-22/235 ) = (30\u221a14 * -22 ) / (11 *235 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n30 and 22 have a common factor of 2: 30=15*2, 22=11*2.\n\n11 in denominator cancels with 11 in numerator.\n\nSo,\n\n(30\u221a14 * -22 ) / (11 *235 ) = (15\u221a14 * -2 ) /235 = (-30\u221a14)/235 = (-6\u221a14)/47.\n\nSo, the slope m is (-6\u221a14)/47.\n\nSo, the equation of line AD is:\n\ny -0 = m(x -10 ) \u2192 y = (-6\u221a14 /47)(x -10 ).\n\nNow, find the intersection point P of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nThe equation of \u03c9 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y =0.\n\nSubstitute y from the line into the circle equation.\n\nSo:\n\nx\u00b2 + [ (-6\u221a14 /47 (x -10 )) ]\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)( (-6\u221a14 /47 (x -10 )) ) =0.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: x\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: [ (-6\u221a14 /47 (x -10 )) ]\u00b2 = (36*14)/(47\u00b2) * (x -10 )\u00b2 = (504)/(2209) (x\u00b2 -20x +100).\n\nThird term: -10x.\n\nFourth term: - (5\u221a14/28) * (-6\u221a14 /47)(x -10 ) = (5\u221a14 *6\u221a14 )/(28*47) (x -10 ).\n\nCompute numerator: 5*6=30; \u221a14*\u221a14=14.\n\nSo, 30*14=420.\n\nDenominator: 28*47=1316.\n\nSo, fourth term: 420/1316 (x -10 )= Simplify 420 and 1316 by dividing by 4: 420/4=105, 1316/4=329.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC. The triangle is inscribed in a circle \u03c9, and there are some tangents and intersections involved. Let me try to visualize and break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that ABC is a triangle with sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle \u03c9 is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. That means all three vertices lie on \u03c9.\n\nNext, the tangents to \u03c9 at points B and C intersect at point D. I remember that the tangent to a circle at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, if I can find the center of \u03c9, then the lines from the center to B and C will be perpendicular to the tangents at B and C, respectively.\n\nPoint D is where these two tangents meet. So, D is the ex-pole or something related to the tangents. I think this point is called the exsimilicenter or something else? Wait, no, the exsimilicenter is related to similar triangles... Hmm, maybe I should just proceed step by step.\n\nThe line AD is drawn, and it intersects \u03c9 again at point P. So, starting from A, drawing a line through D, which is outside the circle, and it intersects the circle again at P. So, AP is the segment from A to P, and we're supposed to find its length.\n\nGiven that, the problem wants AP expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then m + n. Okay.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Find the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC. I might need its radius or something else.\n\n2. Find point D, the intersection of the tangents at B and C.\n\n3. Find the equation of line AD and find its intersection point P with \u03c9 (other than A).\n\n4. Compute the distance from A to P.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a theorem or a property that can relate AP directly without going through all these steps. Let me think.\n\nWait, I remember that the power of a point can be useful here. The power of point D with respect to \u03c9 should be equal to the square of the length of the tangent from D to \u03c9. Since D lies on the tangents at B and C, the power of D is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2.\n\nAlso, since AD is a secant that intersects \u03c9 at A and P, the power of D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DA * DP. So, we have:\n\nDB\u00b2 = DA * DP.\n\nThat's a key equation. So, if I can find DB and DA, I can solve for DP, and then find AP.\n\nBut wait, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is DA + AP? Wait, no. Because P is on \u03c9, and A is also on \u03c9. So, AD is a secant line that starts at A, goes through D, and intersects \u03c9 again at P. So, the length from A to P is AP, and from D to P is DP. But since D is outside the circle, the power of point formula is:\n\nDB\u00b2 = DA * DP.\n\nBut DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. So, DP = DA + AP? Wait, no, because D is outside the circle, and P is the second intersection point. So, actually, DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. So, the entire length from D to A is DA, and from D to P is DP, but since A is on the circle, the power of point D is DA * DP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to the square of the tangent from D to \u03c9, which is DB\u00b2 (since DB is a tangent). Also, the power is equal to DA * DP because AD is a secant intersecting the circle at A and P. So:\n\nDB\u00b2 = DA * DP.\n\nBut DP is the distance from D to P, which is DA + AP, since P is beyond A from D's perspective. Wait, no. If you imagine point D outside the circle, line DA passes through A and then goes into the circle to point P. So, the distance from D to A is DA, and from D to P is DP. So, DP = DA + AP? Or is AP = DP - DA?\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let's say D is outside the circle, and line AD passes through A (on the circle) and then intersects the circle again at P. So, the length from D to A is DA, and from A to P is AP. So, the total length from D to P is DA + AP. So, DP = DA + AP. Therefore, the power of point D is DA * DP = DA * (DA + AP) = DB\u00b2.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nDA * (DA + AP) = DB\u00b2.\n\nSo, if I can find DA and DB, then I can solve for AP.\n\nBut I don't know DA or DB yet. So, I need to find expressions for DA and DB.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the ratio of AP to PD or something. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry. Let me consider placing the triangle in a coordinate system to compute the necessary lengths.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let's place point C at the origin (0,0). Then, point A is at (10,0) because AC=10. Point B is somewhere in the plane. We know AB=5 and BC=9.\n\nSo, coordinates:\n\nC = (0,0)\n\nA = (10,0)\n\nB = (x,y), which we need to find.\n\nWe can compute the coordinates of B using the distances.\n\nGiven AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC=10.\n\nSo, from point A (10,0) to point B (x,y): distance is 5.\n\nFrom point C (0,0) to point B (x,y): distance is 9.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\u221a[(x - 10)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = 5 \u2192 (x - 10)^2 + y^2 = 25 ...(1)\n\n\u221a[(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = 9 \u2192 x^2 + y^2 = 81 ...(2)\n\nSubtracting equation (1) from (2):\n\nx^2 + y^2 - [(x - 10)^2 + y^2] = 81 - 25\n\nx^2 - (x^2 - 20x + 100) = 56\n\nx^2 - x^2 + 20x - 100 = 56\n\n20x - 100 = 56 \u2192 20x = 156 \u2192 x = 156 / 20 = 39/5 = 7.8\n\nSo, x = 39/5.\n\nPlugging back into equation (2):\n\n(39/5)^2 + y^2 = 81\n\n(1521/25) + y^2 = 81\n\ny^2 = 81 - (1521/25) = (2025/25) - (1521/25) = (504)/25\n\nSo, y = \u221a(504/25) = (\u221a504)/5 = (\u221a(16*31.5))/5 \u2192 Wait, 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 16*31 is 496, 16*31.5=504. So, \u221a504 = \u221a(16*31.5) = 4\u221a31.5. But 31.5 is 63/2, so \u221a(63/2). Hmm, maybe better to write as \u221a504 = \u221a(4*126) = 2\u221a126. 126 factors into 9*14, so \u221a126 = 3\u221a14. So, \u221a504 = 2*3\u221a14 = 6\u221a14. So, y = 6\u221a14 /5.\n\nTherefore, point B is at (39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo, coordinates:\n\nA = (10,0)\n\nB = (39/5, 6\u221a14/5)\n\nC = (0,0)\n\nNow, I need to find the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC. To find the equation of \u03c9, I can find the circumradius and the center.\n\nAlternatively, since I have coordinates, I can find the equation of the circle passing through A, B, and C.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0.\n\nSince point C (0,0) lies on the circle:\n\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 \u2192 F = 0.\n\nSo, the equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey = 0.\n\nNow, plug in point A (10,0):\n\n10\u00b2 + 0 + D*10 + E*0 = 0 \u2192 100 + 10D = 0 \u2192 10D = -100 \u2192 D = -10.\n\nSo, equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey = 0.\n\nNow, plug in point B (39/5, 6\u221a14/5):\n\n(39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5) = 0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25.\n\n(6\u221a14/5)^2 = (36*14)/25 = 504/25.\n\n-10*(39/5) = -78.\n\nSo,\n\n1521/25 + 504/25 -78 + (6\u221a14 E)/5 = 0.\n\nAdding the fractions:\n\n(1521 + 504)/25 = 2025/25 = 81.\n\nSo, 81 -78 + (6\u221a14 E)/5 = 0 \u2192 3 + (6\u221a14 E)/5 = 0.\n\nSo,\n\n(6\u221a14 E)/5 = -3 \u2192 6\u221a14 E = -15 \u2192 E = (-15)/(6\u221a14) = (-5)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing the denominator:\n\nE = (-5\u221a14)/(2*14) = (-5\u221a14)/28.\n\nSo, the equation of the circle is:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nNow, I need to find the tangents at B and C.\n\nWait, the tangent at C is easy because C is at (0,0). The tangent at C to circle \u03c9.\n\nThe equation of the tangent at a point (x1, y1) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is given by:\n\nxx1 + yy1 + (D(x + x1))/2 + (E(y + y1))/2 + F = 0.\n\nSince F=0, the equation simplifies.\n\nFor point C (0,0):\n\nThe tangent equation is:\n\nx*0 + y*0 + D(x + 0)/2 + E(y + 0)/2 + 0 = 0 \u2192 D x /2 + E y /2 = 0.\n\nSubstituting D = -10, E = -5\u221a14/28:\n\n(-10/2) x + (-5\u221a14/28)/2 y = 0 \u2192 -5x - (5\u221a14/56)y = 0.\n\nWait, let me compute that again:\n\nD = -10, so D/2 = -5.\n\nE = (-5\u221a14)/28, so E/2 = (-5\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo, the tangent at C is:\n\n-5x - (5\u221a14/56)y = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 56 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-280x -5\u221a14 y = 0 \u2192 280x +5\u221a14 y = 0.\n\nBut let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, since the tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC, where O is the center of the circle.\n\nWait, the center of the circle is at ( -D/2, -E/2 ). Since the general equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0, the center is at (-D/2, -E/2).\n\nSo, D=-10, E= (-5\u221a14)/28.\n\nThus, center O is at (5, (5\u221a14)/56).\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\nCenter O is at (-D/2, -E/2) = (10/2, (5\u221a14)/56 ) = (5, (5\u221a14)/56 ).\n\nSo, the radius OC is the distance from O to C (0,0):\n\n\u221a(5\u00b2 + (5\u221a14/56)^2 ) = \u221a(25 + (25*14)/(56\u00b2)).\n\nSimplify denominator: 56\u00b2 = 3136.\n\nSo, (25*14)/3136 = 350/3136 = 25/224.\n\nSo, radius squared is 25 + 25/224 = (25*224 +25)/224 = (25*(224+1))/224 = 25*225 /224 = 5625/224.\n\nSo, radius is \u221a(5625/224) = 75/\u221a224 = 75\u221a224 / 224. But maybe we don't need the exact value right now.\n\nSo, the tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC. The slope of OC is ( (5\u221a14/56) - 0 ) / (5 - 0) ) = (5\u221a14/56)/5 = \u221a14/56.\n\nSo, slope of OC is \u221a14/56. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is the negative reciprocal, which is -56/\u221a14.\n\nSimplify: -56/\u221a14 = -56\u221a14 /14 = -4\u221a14.\n\nSo, the tangent at C has slope -4\u221a14 and passes through C (0,0). So, its equation is y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSimilarly, let's find the tangent at B.\n\nPoint B is (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). The radius OB is the line from O (5, 5\u221a14/56) to B (39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nCompute the slope of OB:\n\nSlope = (6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56 ) / (39/5 -5).\n\nConvert to common denominators:\n\nNumerator: (6\u221a14/5) - (5\u221a14/56) = (6\u221a14 *56 -5\u221a14 *5 ) / (5*56) = (336\u221a14 -25\u221a14)/280 = (311\u221a14)/280.\n\nDenominator: 39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5 =14/5.\n\nSo, slope is (311\u221a14/280) / (14/5) = (311\u221a14/280) * (5/14) = (311\u221a14 *5 )/(280*14 ) = (1555\u221a14 )/(3920 ) = Simplify numerator and denominator by 5: 311\u221a14 / 784.\n\nSo, the slope of OB is 311\u221a14 /784.\n\nThus, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal: -784/(311\u221a14 ).\n\nSimplify: -784/(311\u221a14 ) = multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\n-784\u221a14 / (311*14 ) = -784\u221a14 / 4354.\n\nSimplify 784 and 4354: 784 divides by 14: 784 = 14*56; 4354 /14= 4354 \u00f714= 311.\n\nSo, it's -56\u221a14 /311.\n\nSo, the tangent at B has slope -56\u221a14 /311 and passes through B (39/5,6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo, equation is:\n\ny - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14 /311)(x - 39/5).\n\nNow, point D is the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.\n\nWe already have the tangent at C: y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSo, let's substitute y = -4\u221a14 x into the equation of the tangent at B.\n\nSo:\n\n-4\u221a14 x - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14 /311)(x - 39/5).\n\nMultiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n311*(-4\u221a14 x - 6\u221a14/5 ) = -56\u221a14 (x - 39/5).\n\nExpand both sides:\n\nLeft side: 311*(-4\u221a14 x) + 311*(-6\u221a14/5) = -1244\u221a14 x - (1866\u221a14)/5.\n\nRight side: -56\u221a14 x + (56\u221a14 *39)/5 = -56\u221a14 x + (2184\u221a14)/5.\n\nNow, bring all terms to left side:\n\n-1244\u221a14 x - (1866\u221a14)/5 +56\u221a14 x - (2184\u221a14)/5 =0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-1244\u221a14 +56\u221a14 )x + (-1866\u221a14 -2184\u221a14)/5 =0.\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\n-1244\u221a14 +56\u221a14 = (-1244 +56)\u221a14 = (-1188)\u221a14.\n\n-1866\u221a14 -2184\u221a14 = (-4050\u221a14 ).\n\nSo:\n\n-1188\u221a14 x - (4050\u221a14)/5 =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a14:\n\n-1188 x - 4050/5 =0 \u2192 -1188x -810=0.\n\nSolving for x:\n\n-1188x =810 \u2192 x= -810/1188.\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 9: 810/9=90, 1188/9=132.\n\nSo, x= -90/132.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 6: 90/6=15, 132/6=22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nNow, substitute x into y = -4\u221a14 x:\n\ny= -4\u221a14*(-15/22)= (60\u221a14)/22= (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo, point D is at ( -15/22, 30\u221a14 /11 ).\n\nNow, I need to find the equation of line AD, which connects point A (10,0) and D (-15/22, 30\u221a14 /11 ).\n\nCompute the slope of AD:\n\nSlope m = (30\u221a14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10 ) = (30\u221a14/11 ) / ( (-15/22 -220/22 ) ) = (30\u221a14/11 ) / (-235/22 ) = (30\u221a14/11 ) * (-22/235 ) = (30\u221a14 * -22 ) / (11 *235 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n30 and 22 have a common factor of 2: 30=15*2, 22=11*2.\n\n11 in denominator cancels with 11 in numerator.\n\nSo,\n\n(30\u221a14 * -22 ) / (11 *235 ) = (15\u221a14 * -2 ) /235 = (-30\u221a14)/235 = (-6\u221a14)/47.\n\nSo, the slope m is (-6\u221a14)/47.\n\nSo, the equation of line AD is:\n\ny -0 = m(x -10 ) \u2192 y = (-6\u221a14 /47)(x -10 ).\n\nNow, find the intersection point P of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nThe equation of \u03c9 is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y =0.\n\nSubstitute y from the line into the circle equation.\n\nSo:\n\nx\u00b2 + [ (-6\u221a14 /47 (x -10 )) ]\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)( (-6\u221a14 /47 (x -10 )) ) =0.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: x\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: [ (-6\u221a14 /47 (x -10 )) ]\u00b2 = (36*14)/(47\u00b2) * (x -10 )\u00b2 = (504)/(2209) (x\u00b2 -20x +100).\n\nThird term: -10x.\n\nFourth term: - (5\u221a14/28) * (-6\u221a14 /47)(x -10 ) = (5\u221a14 *6\u221a14 )/(28*47) (x -10 ).\n\nCompute numerator: 5*6=30; \u221a14*\u221a14=14.\n\nSo, 30*14=420.\n\nDenominator: 28*47=1316.\n\nSo, fourth term: 420/1316 (x -10 )= Simplify 420 and 1316 by dividing by 4: 420/4=105, 1316/4=329. So, 105/329 (x -10 ).\n\nNow, putting all together:\n\nx\u00b2 + (504/2209)(x\u00b2 -20x +100) -10x + (105/329)(x -10 )=0.\n\nMultiply through by 2209*329 to eliminate denominators. Hmm, that might be too messy. Alternatively, maybe I can compute each term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to parametrize line AD and substitute into the circle equation.\n\nParametrizing line AD:\n\nLet t be a parameter such that when t=0, we're at A (10,0), and t=1, we're at D (-15/22, 30\u221a14 /11 ).\n\nSo, parametric equations:\n\nx =10 + t*(-15/22 -10 ) =10 + t*(-235/22 )\n\ny= 0 + t*(30\u221a14 /11 -0 )= t*(30\u221a14 /11 )\n\nSo, x=10 - (235/22 )t\n\ny= (30\u221a14 /11 ) t\n\nNow, substitute x and y into the circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14 /28 )y =0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nx\u00b2 = [10 - (235/22 )t]^2 =100 - 2*10*(235/22 )t + (235/22 )\u00b2 t\u00b2.\n\ny\u00b2= [ (30\u221a14 /11 ) t ]\u00b2 = (900*14)/121 t\u00b2= 12600/121 t\u00b2.\n\n-10x= -10*(10 -235/22 t )= -100 + (2350/22 )t.\n\n-(5\u221a14 /28 )y= -(5\u221a14 /28 )*(30\u221a14 /11 )t = -(150*14)/(28*11 )t = -(2100)/(308 )t = - (2100 \u00f728 )/(308 \u00f728 ) t= -75/11 t.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n-(5\u221a14 /28 )*(30\u221a14 /11 )t = -(5*30)*(\u221a14 *\u221a14 )/(28*11 ) t= -150 *14 / (308 ) t.\n\n14 and 308: 308 \u00f714=22.\n\nSo, 150*14=2100; 2100/308 = 2100/(14*22 )= (2100/14)/22=150/22=75/11.\n\nSo, -(5\u221a14 /28 )y= -75/11 t.\n\nSo, putting all terms together:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14 /28 )y = [100 - (4700/22 )t + (55225/484 )t\u00b2 ] + [12600/121 t\u00b2 ] + [ -100 + (2350/22 )t ] + [ -75/11 t ] =0.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n100 - (4700/22 )t + (55225/484 )t\u00b2 +12600/121 t\u00b2 -100 + (2350/22 )t -75/11 t =0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n100 -100 =0.\n\nFor t terms:\n\n-4700/22 t +2350/22 t -75/11 t.\n\nConvert all to 22 denominator:\n\n-4700/22 t +2350/22 t - (75*2)/22 t = (-4700 +2350 -150)/22 t = (-2500)/22 t.\n\nFor t\u00b2 terms:\n\n55225/484 t\u00b2 +12600/121 t\u00b2.\n\nConvert 12600/121 to 484 denominator: 121*4=484, so multiply numerator and denominator by 4: 12600*4=50400, so 50400/484.\n\nSo, 55225/484 +50400/484 = (55225+50400)/484 =105625/484 t\u00b2.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n105625/484 t\u00b2 -2500/22 t =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 484 to eliminate denominators:\n\n105625 t\u00b2 - (2500/22)*484 t =0.\n\nCompute (2500/22)*484:\n\n484 \u00f722=22, so 2500 *22=55,000.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n105625 t\u00b2 -55,000 t =0.\n\nFactor:\n\nt(105625 t -55,000 )=0.\n\nSolutions are t=0, which corresponds to point A, and 105625 t -55,000=0 \u2192 t=55,000 /105,625.\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25: 55,000 \u00f725=2,200; 105,625 \u00f725=4,225.\n\nSo, t=2,200 /4,225.\n\nSimplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by 25: 2,200 \u00f725=88; 4,225 \u00f725=169.\n\nSo, t=88/169.\n\nSo, t=88/169 is the parameter for point P.\n\nNow, compute the coordinates of P using the parametric equations:\n\nx=10 - (235/22 )*(88/169 )\n\ny= (30\u221a14 /11 )*(88/169 )\n\nCompute x:\n\n235/22 *88/169 = (235*88)/(22*169 )\n\nSimplify 88/22=4, so:\n\n235*4 /169 =940 /169.\n\nSo, x=10 -940/169.\n\nConvert 10 to 1690/169:\n\n1690/169 -940/169=750/169.\n\nSo, x=750/169.\n\nCompute y:\n\n30\u221a14 /11 *88/169 = (30*88\u221a14 )/(11*169 )\n\nSimplify 88/11=8:\n\n30*8\u221a14 /169 =240\u221a14 /169.\n\nSo, y=240\u221a14 /169.\n\nSo, point P is at (750/169, 240\u221a14 /169 ).\n\nNow, I need to find the length of AP.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0)= (1690/169, 0).\n\nPoint P is at (750/169, 240\u221a14 /169 ).\n\nSo, AP distance:\n\n\u221a[ (750/169 -1690/169 )\u00b2 + (240\u221a14 /169 -0 )\u00b2 ]\n\nSimplify differences:\n\n750 -1690= -940.\n\nSo,\n\n\u221a[ (-940/169 )\u00b2 + (240\u221a14 /169 )\u00b2 ] = \u221a[ (940\u00b2 + (240\u00b2 *14 )) /169\u00b2 ] = (1/169 )\u221a[940\u00b2 + 240\u00b2 *14 ].\n\nCompute inside the square root:\n\n940\u00b2 = (900 +40 )\u00b2=900\u00b2 +2*900*40 +40\u00b2=810,000 +72,000 +1,600=883,600.\n\n240\u00b2=57,600; 57,600*14=806,400.\n\nSo, total inside sqrt: 883,600 +806,400=1,690,000.\n\n\u221a1,690,000=1,300.\n\nSo, AP= (1/169 )*1,300=1300/169.\n\nSimplify 1300 \u00f713=100; 169 \u00f713=13.\n\nSo, 1300/169=100/13.\n\nSo, AP=100/13.\n\nThus, m=100, n=13, which are coprime.\n\nSo, m +n=113.\n\n\nTo solve for \\( AP \\) in triangle \\( ABC \\) with sides \\( AB = 5 \\), \\( BC = 9 \\), and \\( AC = 10 \\), we utilize the power of a point theorem and coordinate geometry.\n\n1. **Coordinates of Points**:  \n   Place \\( C \\) at the origin \\((0,0)\\), \\( A \\) at \\((10,0)\\), and find \\( B \\) using distance formulas.  \n   Solving, \\( B \\) is at \\(\\left(\\frac{39}{5}, \\frac{6\\sqrt{14}}{5}\\right)\\).\n\n2. **Circumcircle Equation**:  \n   The circumcircle \\( \\omega \\) of \\( ABC \\) has the equation \\( x^2 + y^2 - 10x - \\frac{5\\sqrt{14}}{28}y = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Tangents at \\( B \\) and \\( C \\)**:  \n   The tangent at \\( C \\) is \\( y = -4\\sqrt{14}x \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nWe have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents to \u03c9 at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects \u03c9 again at point P. We are given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, first, maybe I should compute some properties of triangle ABC, like its circumradius or other angles or lengths, which might help later.\n\nWait, but before that, let me think about the given setup. The tangents at B and C meet at D. So, D is the ex-pole of BC, right? Or, more specifically, the intersection of the two tangents at B and C is D, which makes D the ex-pole or the external homothety center? Hmm, not entirely sure, but I know that BD and CD are tangents to the circle \u03c9, so BD = CD because tangents from a common external point are equal in length.\n\nSo, BD = CD. That might be useful later.\n\nAlso, point D is outside the circle \u03c9, and line AD intersects \u03c9 again at P. So, AP is a secant from A passing through P, which is another intersection point with \u03c9.\n\nI think I might be able to use the power of a point here. Since D is outside the circle, the power of D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 because BD and CD are tangents.\n\nAlso, since AD is a secant, the power of D can also be expressed as DP * DA = DB\u00b2. Hmm, that seems useful. So, if I can find DA, then I can find DP, which would relate to AP.\n\nWait, let me write that down:\n\nPower of point D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DP * DA.\n\nSo, if I can find DB, then I can find DP in terms of DA, or vice versa.\n\nBut to find DB, I need more information. Maybe I can compute the distance from D to B, but I don't know where D is exactly. Alternatively, maybe I can express DB in terms of the sides of triangle ABC.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinates or trigonometry would be helpful here. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let me try to find some properties of triangle ABC. Given sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. Let me compute its semiperimeter, area, and circumradius.\n\nSemiperimeter, s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.\n\nArea can be found using Heron's formula: sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)].\n\nSo, area = sqrt[12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[504].\n\nSimplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, 504 = 16 * 31.5 isn't exact. Let me factor 504:\n\n504 = 16 * 31.5? No, wait. 504 divided by 9 is 56. So, 504 = 9 * 56 = 9 * 7 * 8 = 9 * 7 * 8. So, sqrt(9*7*8) = 3*sqrt(56) = 3*sqrt(4*14) = 3*2*sqrt(14) = 6*sqrt(14). So, the area is 6\u221a14.\n\nNow, the circumradius R of triangle ABC can be found using the formula:\n\nR = (AB * BC * AC) / (4 * area).\n\nSo, R = (5 * 9 * 10) / (4 * 6\u221a14) = (450) / (24\u221a14) = (75) / (4\u221a14). Let me rationalize the denominator: (75\u221a14)/(4*14) = (75\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo, R = 75\u221a14 / 56.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the circumradius is 75\u221a14 / 56. Not sure if that's directly useful, but perhaps.\n\nNow, thinking back to point D. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, it's called the ex-pole or sometimes the symmedian point, but I think it's more accurately called the ex-pole. Alternatively, it's the external homothety center.\n\nWait, perhaps using harmonic division or projective geometry concepts might help, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe using coordinates.\n\nLet me try coordinate geometry. Let me place the triangle ABC in a coordinate system to make calculations easier.\n\nLet me place point C at the origin (0, 0), point B somewhere in the plane, and point A at (10, 0) since AC = 10. Wait, but AB is 5 and BC is 9. Hmm, let me check if that works.\n\nWait, if C is at (0,0), A is at (10,0), then AC is 10, which is correct. Then, point B is somewhere in the plane such that AB=5 and BC=9.\n\nSo, coordinates: A(10, 0), C(0, 0). Let me find coordinates of point B.\n\nLet me denote point B as (x, y). Then, distance from B to C is 9, so sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 9 \u2192 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 81.\n\nDistance from B to A is 5, so sqrt((x - 10)^2 + y\u00b2) = 5 \u2192 (x - 10)^2 + y\u00b2 = 25.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second: (x - 10)^2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 25 - 81 \u2192 x\u00b2 -20x + 100 + y\u00b2 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -56 \u2192 -20x + 100 = -56 \u2192 -20x = -156 \u2192 x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.\n\nSo, x = 7.8, which is 39/5. Then, plugging back into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =81: (39/5)^2 + y\u00b2 =81 \u2192 (1521/25) + y\u00b2 =81 \u2192 y\u00b2=81 - 1521/25 = (2025 - 1521)/25 = 504/25 \u2192 y= sqrt(504)/5 = (6\u221a14)/5.\n\nSo, point B is at (39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo, coordinates:\n\nA(10, 0)\n\nB(39/5, 6\u221a14/5)\n\nC(0, 0)\n\nNow, I need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC.\n\nWait, but since \u03c9 is the circumcircle, tangents at B and C meet at D. So, to find D, perhaps I can find the equations of the tangents at B and C and find their intersection.\n\nFirst, I need the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9. Since points A, B, C lie on it, let me find the equation.\n\nGeneral equation of a circle: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0.\n\nSince points A, B, C lie on it, let's plug their coordinates.\n\nFor point A(10,0):\n\n10\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + D*10 + E*0 + F = 0 \u2192 100 + 10D + F = 0 \u2192 10D + F = -100. Equation (1).\n\nFor point C(0,0):\n\n0\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + D*0 + E*0 + F = 0 \u2192 F = 0. Wait, but from equation (1), 10D + F = -100. If F=0, then 10D = -100 \u2192 D = -10.\n\nSo, D = -10, F=0.\n\nNow, using point B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5):\n\n(39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 + D*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5) + F = 0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25\n\n(6\u221a14/5)^2 = (36*14)/25 = 504/25\n\nD*(39/5) = (-10)*(39/5) = -78\n\nE*(6\u221a14/5) remains as is.\n\nF = 0.\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\n1521/25 + 504/25 - 78 + (6\u221a14/5)E = 0\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n(1521 + 504)/25 = 2025/25 = 81\n\nSo, 81 - 78 + (6\u221a14/5)E = 0 \u2192 3 + (6\u221a14/5)E = 0 \u2192 (6\u221a14/5)E = -3 \u2192 E = (-3)*(5)/(6\u221a14) = (-15)/(6\u221a14) = (-5)/(2\u221a14) = (-5\u221a14)/(28).\n\nSo, E = (-5\u221a14)/28.\n\nThus, the equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey = 0, with E as above.\n\nSo, equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nAlternatively, I can write it as:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nNow, I need the equations of the tangents at points B and C.\n\nFirst, the tangent at point C(0,0). The general equation for the tangent to a circle at a point (x\u2081, y\u2081) is:\n\nxx\u2081 + yy\u2081 + D*(x + x\u2081)/2 + E*(y + y\u2081)/2 + F = 0.\n\nWait, no. Alternatively, another method: the tangent at point (x\u2081,y\u2081) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is given by:\n\nxx\u2081 + yy\u2081 + D*(x + x\u2081)/2 + E*(y + y\u2081)/2 + F = 0.\n\nWait, let me check that formula. Alternatively, I might have confused it with the equation of the polar line.\n\nAlternatively, another way: the tangent line at point (x\u2081, y\u2081) on the circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the slope of the radius is (y\u2081 - k)/(x\u2081 - h), where (h,k) is the center.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to compute the derivative or use point-slope form.\n\nAlternatively, the equation of the tangent at a point can be found using the formula:\n\nFor a circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, the tangent at (x\u2081, y\u2081) is (x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y - k) = r^2.\n\nBut in our case, the circle is given by x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0. Let me rewrite this in standard form.\n\nComplete the squares:\n\nx\u00b2 -10x + y\u00b2 - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nx\u00b2 -10x = (x -5)^2 -25\n\ny\u00b2 - (5\u221a14/28)y = [y - (5\u221a14)/(56)]^2 - [ (5\u221a14/56)^2 ]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n(x -5)^2 -25 + [y - (5\u221a14)/(56)]^2 - [ (25*14)/(56^2) ] = 0.\n\nCompute (5\u221a14/56)^2:\n\n= 25*14 / (56^2) = 350 / 3136 = 25*14 / (784) = 350 / 3136 = 25*14 / (56^2) = 25*14/(3136) = (350)/(3136) = 25/224.\n\nWait, because 56^2 is 3136, and 25*14 is 350. So, 350/3136 simplifies to 25/224.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n(x -5)^2 + [y - (5\u221a14)/(56)]^2 = 25 + 25/224.\n\nCompute 25 + 25/224: 25*(1 + 1/224) = 25*(225/224) = 5625/224.\n\nSo, the circle has center at (5, 5\u221a14/56) and radius sqrt(5625/224) = 75/sqrt(224).\n\nSimplify sqrt(224): 224 = 16*14, so sqrt(224) = 4\u221a14. Thus, radius R = 75/(4\u221a14) = (75\u221a14)/(56). Which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, now, the tangent at point C(0,0).\n\nThe equation of the tangent at (0,0) to the circle (x -5)^2 + (y - 5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nUsing the tangent formula: (x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, that's the equation for the tangent line. Wait, actually, the formula is:\n\nFor a circle with center (h, k), the tangent at (x\u2081, y\u2081) is (x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2.\n\nWait, but that's actually the equation for the tangent line. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, no, I think it's (x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2.\n\nWait, but plugging in (x\u2081, y\u2081) into that equation would give (x\u2081 - h)^2 + (y\u2081 - k)^2 = r\u00b2, which is correct because (x\u2081, y\u2081) is on the circle.\n\nSo, the tangent line is (x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2.\n\nSo, for point C(0,0), x\u2081=0, y\u2081=0.\n\nThus, the tangent equation is (0 -5)(x -5) + (0 - 5\u221a14/56)(y - 5\u221a14/56) = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(0 -5)(x -5) = -5(x -5) = -5x +25.\n\n(0 -5\u221a14/56)(y -5\u221a14/56) = (-5\u221a14/56)(y -5\u221a14/56) = (-5\u221a14/56)y + (5\u221a14/56)(5\u221a14/56) = (-5\u221a14/56)y + (25*14)/(56^2) = (-5\u221a14/56)y + 350/(3136) = (-5\u221a14/56)y + 25/224.\n\nSo, combining these:\n\n-5x +25 - (5\u221a14/56)y + 25/224 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nCompute the right-hand side: (75\u221a14/56)^2 = (75^2 *14)/(56^2) = (5625 *14)/3136 = 78750/3136.\n\nSimplify 78750/3136: Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 39375/1568. Hmm, perhaps that's as simplified as it gets.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\n-5x - (5\u221a14/56)y +25 +25/224 = 78750/3136.\n\nCompute 25 +25/224: 25 is 5600/224, so 5600/224 +25/224 = 5625/224.\n\nSo, left-hand side is -5x - (5\u221a14/56)y +5625/224.\n\nSet equal to 78750/3136.\n\nSo,\n\n-5x - (5\u221a14/56)y +5625/224 = 78750/3136.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3136 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-5x*3136 - (5\u221a14/56)y*3136 + (5625/224)*3136 = 78750.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-5x*3136 = -15680x.\n\n- (5\u221a14/56)y *3136 = - (5\u221a14)*(3136/56)y = -5\u221a14 *56 y = -280\u221a14 y.\n\n(5625/224)*3136 = 5625 * (3136/224) = 5625 *14 = 78750.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n-15680x -280\u221a14 y +78750 =78750.\n\nSubtract 78750 from both sides:\n\n-15680x -280\u221a14 y =0.\n\nDivide both sides by -280:\n\n(15680/280)x + \u221a14 y =0.\n\nSimplify 15680 /280: 15680 \u00f7280 = 56.\n\nSo, equation is 56x + \u221a14 y =0.\n\nSo, the tangent at C is 56x + \u221a14 y =0.\n\nSimilarly, now find the tangent at B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nUsing the same formula: (x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2.\n\nWhere h=5, k=5\u221a14/56, x\u2081=39/5, y\u2081=6\u221a14/5.\n\nSo, the tangent equation is:\n\n(39/5 -5)(x -5) + (6\u221a14/5 -5\u221a14/56)(y -5\u221a14/56) = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5 =14/5.\n\nSo, (14/5)(x -5) = (14/5)x -14.\n\nNow, compute the y-term:\n\n6\u221a14/5 -5\u221a14/56. Let me find a common denominator, which is 280.\n\n6\u221a14/5 = (6\u221a14 *56)/280 = 336\u221a14/280.\n\n5\u221a14/56 = (5\u221a14 *5)/280 =25\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, 336\u221a14/280 -25\u221a14/280 = 311\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, the y-term is (311\u221a14/280)(y -5\u221a14/56).\n\nExpanding this:\n\n311\u221a14/280 * y - (311\u221a14/280)(5\u221a14/56).\n\nCompute the second term:\n\n(311\u221a14 *5\u221a14)/(280 *56) = (311 *5 *14)/(280 *56) = (311 *70)/(15680) = 21770/15680 = Simplify.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 70: 311/224.\n\nWait, 21770 \u00f770=311, 15680 \u00f770=224.\n\nSo, the second term is -311/224.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n(14/5)x -14 + (311\u221a14/280)y -311/224 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nThe right-hand side is (75\u221a14/56)^2 = 78750/3136, as computed earlier.\n\nSo, left-hand side:\n\n(14/5)x + (311\u221a14/280)y -14 -311/224 = 78750/3136.\n\nCompute constants:\n\n-14 is -3136/224.\n\n-311/224.\n\nSo, total constants: (-3136 -311)/224 = -3447/224.\n\nSo, equation is:\n\n(14/5)x + (311\u221a14/280)y -3447/224 =78750/3136.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3136 to eliminate denominators:\n\n(14/5)x *3136 + (311\u221a14/280)y *3136 -3447/224 *3136 =78750.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(14/5)x *3136 = (14*3136/5)x = (43904/5)x.\n\n(311\u221a14/280)y *3136 = (311\u221a14 *3136/280)y = 311\u221a14 *11.2 y = Wait, 3136 \u00f7280 = 11.2? Let me compute 3136 \u00f7280: 280*11=3080, 3136-3080=56, 56/280=0.2. So, 11.2. So, 311\u221a14 *11.2 y = 311*11.2\u221a14 y.\n\nBut 11.2 is 56/5. So, 311\u221a14*(56/5)y = (311*56\u221a14)/5 y.\n\n311*56: Let me compute 300*56=16800, 11*56=616, so total 16800+616=17416.\n\nSo, (17416\u221a14)/5 y.\n\nThird term: -3447/224 *3136 = -3447 * (3136/224) = -3447 *14 = -48258.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(43904/5)x + (17416\u221a14/5)y -48258 =78750.\n\nBring constants to the right:\n\n(43904/5)x + (17416\u221a14/5)y =78750 +48258 =127008.\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 to eliminate denominators:\n\n43904x +17416\u221a14 y =635040.\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n43904x +17416\u221a14 y =635040.\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy. Let me see if I can factor out some common terms.\n\nLooking at coefficients:\n\n43904, 17416, 635040.\n\nLet me see if they have a common factor. Let's try 8:\n\n43904 \u00f78=5488.\n\n17416 \u00f78=2177.\n\n635040 \u00f78=79380.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n5488x +2177\u221a14 y =79380.\n\nStill not very clean. Maybe 7?\n\n5488 \u00f77=784.\n\n2177 \u00f77=311.\n\n79380 \u00f77=11340.\n\nSo, equation now is:\n\n784x +311\u221a14 y =11340.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the tangent at B is 784x +311\u221a14 y =11340.\n\nNow, we have two equations for the two tangents:\n\n1. Tangent at C: 56x +\u221a14 y =0.\n\n2. Tangent at B:784x +311\u221a14 y =11340.\n\nWe need to find their intersection point D.\n\nSo, solve the system:\n\n56x +\u221a14 y =0. \u2192 Equation (a)\n\n784x +311\u221a14 y =11340. \u2192 Equation (b)\n\nLet me solve equation (a) for y:\n\n\u221a14 y = -56x \u2192 y = (-56/\u221a14)x.\n\nSimplify: 56/\u221a14 = (56\u221a14)/14 =4\u221a14. So, y= -4\u221a14 x.\n\nNow, substitute y into equation (b):\n\n784x +311\u221a14*(-4\u221a14 x) =11340.\n\nCompute the second term:\n\n311\u221a14*(-4\u221a14 x) = -4*311*(\u221a14)^2 x = -4*311*14 x = -4*4354 x = -17416 x.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n784x -17416x =11340 \u2192 (784 -17416)x =11340 \u2192 (-16632)x =11340 \u2192 x=11340 / (-16632).\n\nSimplify this fraction.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 12: 11340 \u00f712=945, 16632 \u00f712=1386.\n\nSo, x= -945/1386.\n\nSimplify further: both divided by 3: 945 \u00f73=315, 1386 \u00f73=462.\n\nx= -315/462.\n\nAgain, divide by 3: 315 \u00f73=105, 462 \u00f73=154.\n\nx= -105/154.\n\nAgain, divide by 7: 105 \u00f77=15, 154 \u00f77=22.\n\nx= -15/22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nThen, y= -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22) =60\u221a14/22 =30\u221a14/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, we need to find the equation of line AD.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nSo, the slope m of AD is (y_D - y_A)/(x_D - x_A) = (30\u221a14/11 -0)/(-15/22 -10) = (30\u221a14/11) / (-15/22 -220/22) = (30\u221a14/11) / (-235/22).\n\nSimplify:\n\n(30\u221a14/11) * (22/-235) = (30\u221a14 *22)/(11*(-235)).\n\nSimplify 30/11 and 22: 22/11=2, so 30*2=60.\n\nSo, 60\u221a14 / (-235) = -60\u221a14 /235.\n\nSimplify the fraction: 60 and 235 have a common factor of 5: 60 \u00f75=12, 235 \u00f75=47.\n\nSo, slope m= -12\u221a14 /47.\n\nSo, the equation of line AD is y -0 = m(x -10), so y= (-12\u221a14 /47)(x -10).\n\nNow, we need to find point P, which is the second intersection of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nWe already know that A is on both the line and the circle, so P is the other point.\n\nTo find P, we can solve the system of the line and the circle.\n\nThe equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y =0.\n\nThe equation of the line is y= (-12\u221a14 /47)(x -10).\n\nLet me substitute y into the circle equation.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 + [ (-12\u221a14 /47 (x -10) ) ]\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)(-12\u221a14 /47 (x -10)) =0.\n\nCompute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: x\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: [ (-12\u221a14 /47 (x -10) ) ]\u00b2 = (144*14)/(47\u00b2) (x -10)^2 = (2016)/(2209)(x\u00b2 -20x +100).\n\nThird term: -10x.\n\nFourth term: - (5\u221a14/28)(-12\u221a14 /47)(x -10) = (5\u221a14 *12\u221a14)/(28*47)(x -10).\n\nSimplify:\n\n(5*12*(\u221a14)^2)/(28*47)(x -10) = (60*14)/(1316)(x -10) = (840)/(1316)(x -10).\n\nSimplify 840/1316: divide numerator and denominator by 4: 210/329.\n\nSo, fourth term is (210/329)(x -10).\n\nNow, putting all terms together:\n\nx\u00b2 + (2016/2209)(x\u00b2 -20x +100) -10x + (210/329)(x -10) =0.\n\nLet me multiply through by 2209*329 to eliminate denominators. That's a bit heavy, but let me proceed.\n\nBut maybe it's better to compute each term step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use substitution.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute each coefficient.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nTerm1: x\u00b2.\n\nTerm2: (2016/2209)x\u00b2 - (2016*20/2209)x + (2016*100)/2209.\n\nTerm3: -10x.\n\nTerm4: (210/329)x - (210*10)/329.\n\nSo, combining all terms:\n\nx\u00b2 + (2016/2209)x\u00b2 - (40320/2209)x + (201600/2209) -10x + (210/329)x -2100/329 =0.\n\nNow, collect like terms:\n\nx\u00b2 terms: 1 + 2016/2209 = (2209 +2016)/2209 = 4225/2209.\n\nx terms: (-40320/2209 -10 +210/329).\n\nConstants: 201600/2209 -2100/329.\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst, x\u00b2 coefficient: 4225/2209.\n\nx terms:\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-40320/2209,\n\n-10 = -10*2209/2209 = -22090/2209,\n\n210/329 = 210*7/2209 = 1470/2209.\n\nWait, because 329*7=2203, wait no. 2209 is 47\u00b2=2209. 329= 7*47=329? 7*47=329? 7*40=280, 7*7=49, so 280+49=329. Yes.\n\nSo, 210/329 =210/(7*47)=30/47. Wait, but maybe better to write over 2209.\n\nWait, 2209 =47\u00b2=47*47.\n\n329=7*47.\n\nSo, 210/329 =210/(7*47)=30/47.\n\nSo, 30/47 =30*47/(47*47)=1410/2209.\n\nWait, no. To express 30/47 in terms of denominator 2209, we need to multiply numerator and denominator by 47: 30*47 / (47*47) =1410/2209.\n\nSo, x terms:\n\n-40320/2209 -22090/2209 +1410/2209 = (-40320 -22090 +1410)/2209.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n-40320 -22090 = -62410.\n\n-62410 +1410 = -61000.\n\nSo, x terms: -61000/2209.\n\nConstants:\n\n201600/2209 -2100/329.\n\nConvert 2100/329 to denominator 2209:\n\n329=7*47. 2209=47\u00b2=47*47.\n\nSo, 2100/329 =2100/(7*47)=300/47.\n\nConvert 300/47 to denominator 2209: multiply numerator and denominator by47: 300*47 /2209 =14100/2209.\n\nSo, constants:\n\n201600/2209 -14100/2209 = (201600 -14100)/2209 =187500/2209.\n\nSo, now, the equation becomes:\n\n(4225/2209)x\u00b2 - (61000/2209)x +187500/2209 =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2209 to eliminate denominators:\n\n4225x\u00b2 -61000x +187500 =0.\n\nSo, quadratic equation:4225x\u00b2 -61000x +187500=0.\n\nLet me try to solve this quadratic for x.\n\nQuadratic equation: ax\u00b2 +bx +c=0.\n\na=4225, b=-61000, c=187500.\n\nUse quadratic formula:\n\nx = [61000 \u00b1 sqrt(61000\u00b2 -4*4225*187500)]/(2*4225).\n\nCompute discriminant D=61000\u00b2 -4*4225*187500.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n61000\u00b2= (61*1000)^2=61\u00b2 *10^6=3721*10^6=3,721,000,000.\n\n4*4225*187500=4*4225=16900; 16900*187500.\n\nCompute 16900 *187500:\n\nFirst, 169 *1875= ?\n\nCompute 169 *1000=169,000.\n\n169 *800=135,200.\n\n169 *75=12,675.\n\nWait, wait, 1875=1000 +800 +75.\n\nWait, but 169*1875=169*(1000 +800 +75)=169*1000 +169*800 +169*75=169,000 +135,200 +12,675= 169,000 +135,200=304,200 +12,675=316,875.\n\nSo, 169*1875=316,875.\n\nThen, 16900 *187500=169*100 *1875*100= (169*1875)*(100*100)=316,875 *10,000=3,168,750,000.\n\nSo, D=3,721,000,000 -3,168,750,000=552,250,000.\n\nSo, sqrt(D)=sqrt(552,250,000).\n\nCompute sqrt(552250000):\n\nWell, 23500\u00b2= (235)^2 *100^2=55225 *10000=552,250,000.\n\nSo, sqrt(552,250,000)=23500.\n\nSo, x= [61000 \u00b123500]/(2*4225).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n61000 +23500=84500.\n\n61000 -23500=37500.\n\nSo, x=84500/(2*4225) and x=37500/(2*4225).\n\nCompute 2*4225=8450.\n\nSo,\n\nx=84500/8450=10.\n\nx=37500/8450=375/84.5= Let me compute 37500 \u00f78450.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 50: 750/169.\n\nSo, x=750/169.\n\nSo, the solutions are x=10 and x=750/169.\n\nSince point A is at (10,0), the other intersection point P must be at x=750/169.\n\nCompute y-coordinate for P.\n\nUsing the equation of line AD: y= (-12\u221a14 /47)(x -10).\n\nSo, when x=750/169,\n\ny= (-12\u221a14 /47)(750/169 -10) = (-12\u221a14 /47)(750/169 -1690/169) = (-12\u221a14 /47)(-940/169).\n\nCompute:\n\n(-12\u221a14 /47)*(-940/169) = (12*940\u221a14)/(47*169).\n\nSimplify:\n\n12 and 47: no common factors.\n\n940 \u00f747=20, because 47*20=940.\n\nSo, 940=47*20.\n\nSo, numerator:12*47*20\u221a14.\n\nDenominator:47*169.\n\nCancel 47:\n\n12*20\u221a14 /169 =240\u221a14 /169.\n\nSo, y=240\u221a14 /169.\n\nThus, point P is at (750/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nNow, we need to find the length AP.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point P is at (750/169,240\u221a14/169).\n\nCompute distance AP.\n\nDistance formula: sqrt[(x_P -x_A)^2 + (y_P -y_A)^2].\n\nCompute x_P -x_A=750/169 -10=750/169 -1690/169= (750 -1690)/169= (-940)/169.\n\ny_P -y_A=240\u221a14/169 -0=240\u221a14/169.\n\nSo,\n\nAP= sqrt[ (-940/169)^2 + (240\u221a14/169)^2 ].\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(-940/169)^2= (940\u00b2)/(169\u00b2)=883600/28561.\n\n(240\u221a14/169)^2= (240\u00b2 *14)/(169\u00b2)= (57600 *14)/28561= 806400/28561.\n\nSo, AP\u00b2=883600/28561 +806400/28561= (883600 +806400)/28561=1,690,000/28561.\n\nSimplify sqrt(1,690,000/28561)=sqrt(1,690,000)/sqrt(28561).\n\nCompute sqrt(1,690,000): sqrt(1,690,000)=sqrt(1690000)=1300.\n\nsqrt(28561)=169, since 169\u00b2=28561.\n\nSo, AP=1300/169.\n\nSimplify 1300/169: 169*7=1183, 169*7=1183, 1300-1183=117. 169*7 +117=1300.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nWe have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents to \u03c9 at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects \u03c9 again at point P. We are given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, first, maybe I should compute some properties of triangle ABC, like its circumradius or other angles or lengths, which might help later.\n\nWait, but before that, let me think about the given setup. The tangents at B and C meet at D. So, D is the ex-pole of BC, right? Or, more specifically, the intersection of the two tangents at B and C is D, which makes D the ex-pole or the external homothety center? Hmm, not entirely sure, but I know that BD and CD are tangents to the circle \u03c9, so BD = CD because tangents from a common external point are equal in length.\n\nSo, BD = CD. That might be useful later.\n\nAlso, point D is outside the circle \u03c9, and line AD intersects \u03c9 again at P. So, AP is a secant from A passing through P, which is another intersection point with \u03c9.\n\nI think I might be able to use the power of a point here. Since D is outside the circle, the power of D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 because BD and CD are tangents.\n\nAlso, since AD is a secant, the power of D can also be expressed as DP * DA = DB\u00b2. Hmm, that seems useful. So, if I can find DA, then I can find DP, which would relate to AP.\n\nWait, let me write that down:\n\nPower of point D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DP * DA.\n\nSo, if I can find DB, then I can find DP in terms of DA, or vice versa.\n\nBut to find DB, I need more information. Maybe I can compute the distance from D to B, but I don't know where D is exactly. Alternatively, maybe I can express DB in terms of the sides of triangle ABC.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinates or trigonometry would be helpful here. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let me try to find some properties of triangle ABC. Given sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. Let me compute its semiperimeter, area, and circumradius.\n\nSemiperimeter, s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.\n\nArea can be found using Heron's formula: sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)].\n\nSo, area = sqrt[12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[504].\n\nSimplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, 504 = 16 * 31.5 isn't exact. Let me factor 504:\n\n504 = 16 * 31.5? No, wait. 504 divided by 9 is 56. So, 504 = 9 * 56 = 9 * 7 * 8 = 9 * 7 * 8. So, sqrt(9*7*8) = 3*sqrt(56) = 3*sqrt(4*14) = 3*2*sqrt(14) = 6*sqrt(14). So, the area is 6\u221a14.\n\nNow, the circumradius R of triangle ABC can be found using the formula:\n\nR = (AB * BC * AC) / (4 * area).\n\nSo, R = (5 * 9 * 10) / (4 * 6\u221a14) = (450) / (24\u221a14) = (75) / (4\u221a14). Let me rationalize the denominator: (75\u221a14)/(4*14) = (75\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo, R = 75\u221a14 / 56.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the circumradius is 75\u221a14 / 56. Not sure if that's directly useful, but perhaps.\n\nNow, thinking back to point D. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, it's called the ex-pole or sometimes the symmedian point, but I think it's more accurately called the ex-pole. Alternatively, it's the external homothety center.\n\nWait, perhaps using harmonic division or projective geometry concepts might help, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe using coordinates.\n\nLet me try coordinate geometry. Let me place the triangle ABC in a coordinate system to make calculations easier.\n\nLet me place point C at the origin (0, 0), point B somewhere in the plane, and point A at (10, 0) since AC = 10. Wait, but AB is 5 and BC is 9. Hmm, let me check if that works.\n\nWait, if C is at (0,0), A is at (10,0), then AC is 10, which is correct. Then, point B is somewhere in the plane such that AB=5 and BC=9.\n\nSo, coordinates: A(10, 0), C(0, 0). Let me find coordinates of point B.\n\nLet me denote point B as (x, y). Then, distance from B to C is 9, so sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 9 \u2192 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 81.\n\nDistance from B to A is 5, so sqrt((x - 10)^2 + y\u00b2) = 5 \u2192 (x - 10)^2 + y\u00b2 = 25.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second: (x - 10)^2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 25 - 81 \u2192 x\u00b2 -20x + 100 + y\u00b2 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -56 \u2192 -20x + 100 = -56 \u2192 -20x = -156 \u2192 x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.\n\nSo, x = 7.8, which is 39/5. Then, plugging back into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =81: (39/5)^2 + y\u00b2 =81 \u2192 (1521/25) + y\u00b2 =81 \u2192 y\u00b2=81 - 1521/25 = (2025 - 1521)/25 = 504/25 \u2192 y= sqrt(504)/5 = (6\u221a14)/5.\n\nSo, point B is at (39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo, coordinates:\n\nA(10, 0)\n\nB(39/5, 6\u221a14/5)\n\nC(0, 0)\n\nNow, I need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC.\n\nWait, but since \u03c9 is the circumcircle, tangents at B and C meet at D. So, to find D, perhaps I can find the equations of the tangents at B and C and find their intersection.\n\nFirst, I need the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9. Since points A, B, C lie on it, let me find the equation.\n\nGeneral equation of a circle: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0.\n\nSince points A, B, C lie on it, let's plug their coordinates.\n\nFor point A(10,0):\n\n10\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + D*10 + E*0 + F = 0 \u2192 100 + 10D + F = 0 \u2192 10D + F = -100. Equation (1).\n\nFor point C(0,0):\n\n0\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + D*0 + E*0 + F = 0 \u2192 F = 0. Wait, but from equation (1), 10D + F = -100. If F=0, then 10D = -100 \u2192 D = -10.\n\nSo, D = -10, F=0.\n\nNow, using point B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5):\n\n(39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 + D*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5) + F = 0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25\n\n(6\u221a14/5)^2 = (36*14)/25 = 504/25\n\nD*(39/5) = (-10)*(39/5) = -78\n\nE*(6\u221a14/5) remains as is.\n\nF = 0.\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\n1521/25 + 504/25 - 78 + (6\u221a14/5)E = 0\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n(1521 + 504)/25 = 2025/25 = 81\n\nSo, 81 - 78 + (6\u221a14/5)E = 0 \u2192 3 + (6\u221a14/5)E = 0 \u2192 (6\u221a14/5)E = -3 \u2192 E = (-3)*(5)/(6\u221a14) = (-15)/(6\u221a14) = (-5)/(2\u221a14) = (-5\u221a14)/(28).\n\nSo, E = (-5\u221a14)/28.\n\nThus, the equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey = 0, with E as above.\n\nSo, equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nAlternatively, I can write it as:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nNow, I need the equations of the tangents at points B and C.\n\nFirst, the tangent at point C(0,0). The general equation for the tangent to a circle at a point (x\u2081, y\u2081) is:\n\nxx\u2081 + yy\u2081 + D*(x + x\u2081)/2 + E*(y + y\u2081)/2 + F = 0.\n\nWait, no. Alternatively, another method: the tangent at point (x\u2081,y\u2081) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is given by:\n\nxx\u2081 + yy\u2081 + D*(x + x\u2081)/2 + E*(y + y\u2081)/2 + F = 0.\n\nWait, let me check that formula. Alternatively, I might have confused it with the equation of the polar line.\n\nAlternatively, another way: the tangent line at point (x\u2081, y\u2081) on the circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the slope of the radius is (y\u2081 - k)/(x\u2081 - h), where (h,k) is the center.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to compute the derivative or use point-slope form.\n\nAlternatively, the equation of the tangent at a point can be found using the formula:\n\nFor a circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, the tangent at (x\u2081, y\u2081) is (x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y - k) = r^2.\n\nBut in our case, the circle is given by x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0. Let me rewrite this in standard form.\n\nComplete the squares:\n\nx\u00b2 -10x + y\u00b2 - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nx\u00b2 -10x = (x -5)^2 -25\n\ny\u00b2 - (5\u221a14/28)y = [y - (5\u221a14)/(56)]^2 - [ (5\u221a14/56)^2 ]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n(x -5)^2 -25 + [y - (5\u221a14)/(56)]^2 - [ (25*14)/(56^2) ] = 0.\n\nCompute (5\u221a14/56)^2:\n\n= 25*14 / (56^2) = 350 / 3136 = 25*14 / (784) = 350 / 3136 = 25*14 / (56^2) = 25*14/(3136) = (350)/(3136) = 25/224.\n\nWait, because 56^2 is 3136, and 25*14 is 350. So, 350/3136 simplifies to 25/224.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n(x -5)^2 + [y - (5\u221a14)/(56)]^2 = 25 + 25/224.\n\nCompute 25 + 25/224: 25*(1 + 1/224) = 25*(225/224) = 5625/224.\n\nSo, the circle has center at (5, 5\u221a14/56) and radius sqrt(5625/224) = 75/sqrt(224).\n\nSimplify sqrt(224): 224 = 16*14, so sqrt(224) = 4\u221a14. Thus, radius R = 75/(4\u221a14) = (75\u221a14)/(56). Which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, now, the tangent at point C(0,0).\n\nThe equation of the tangent at (0,0) to the circle (x -5)^2 + (y - 5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nUsing the tangent formula: (x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, that's the equation for the tangent line. Wait, actually, the formula is:\n\nFor a circle with center (h, k), the tangent at (x\u2081, y\u2081) is (x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2.\n\nWait, but that's actually the equation for the tangent line. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, no, I think it's (x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2.\n\nWait, but plugging in (x\u2081, y\u2081) into that equation would give (x\u2081 - h)^2 + (y\u2081 - k)^2 = r\u00b2, which is correct because (x\u2081, y\u2081) is on the circle.\n\nSo, the tangent line is (x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2.\n\nSo, for point C(0,0), x\u2081=0, y\u2081=0.\n\nThus, the tangent equation is (0 -5)(x -5) + (0 - 5\u221a14/56)(y - 5\u221a14/56) = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(0 -5)(x -5) = -5(x -5) = -5x +25.\n\n(0 -5\u221a14/56)(y -5\u221a14/56) = (-5\u221a14/56)(y -5\u221a14/56) = (-5\u221a14/56)y + (5\u221a14/56)(5\u221a14/56) = (-5\u221a14/56)y + (25*14)/(56^2) = (-5\u221a14/56)y + 350/(3136) = (-5\u221a14/56)y + 25/224.\n\nSo, combining these:\n\n-5x +25 - (5\u221a14/56)y + 25/224 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nCompute the right-hand side: (75\u221a14/56)^2 = (75^2 *14)/(56^2) = (5625 *14)/3136 = 78750/3136.\n\nSimplify 78750/3136: Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 39375/1568. Hmm, perhaps that's as simplified as it gets.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\n-5x - (5\u221a14/56)y +25 +25/224 = 78750/3136.\n\nCompute 25 +25/224: 25 is 5600/224, so 5600/224 +25/224 = 5625/224.\n\nSo, left-hand side is -5x - (5\u221a14/56)y +5625/224.\n\nSet equal to 78750/3136.\n\nSo,\n\n-5x - (5\u221a14/56)y +5625/224 = 78750/3136.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3136 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-5x*3136 - (5\u221a14/56)y*3136 + (5625/224)*3136 = 78750.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-5x*3136 = -15680x.\n\n- (5\u221a14/56)y *3136 = - (5\u221a14)*(3136/56)y = -5\u221a14 *56 y = -280\u221a14 y.\n\n(5625/224)*3136 = 5625 * (3136/224) = 5625 *14 = 78750.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n-15680x -280\u221a14 y +78750 =78750.\n\nSubtract 78750 from both sides:\n\n-15680x -280\u221a14 y =0.\n\nDivide both sides by -280:\n\n(15680/280)x + \u221a14 y =0.\n\nSimplify 15680 /280: 15680 \u00f7280 = 56.\n\nSo, equation is 56x + \u221a14 y =0.\n\nSo, the tangent at C is 56x + \u221a14 y =0.\n\nSimilarly, now find the tangent at B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nUsing the same formula: (x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2.\n\nWhere h=5, k=5\u221a14/56, x\u2081=39/5, y\u2081=6\u221a14/5.\n\nSo, the tangent equation is:\n\n(39/5 -5)(x -5) + (6\u221a14/5 -5\u221a14/56)(y -5\u221a14/56) = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5 =14/5.\n\nSo, (14/5)(x -5) = (14/5)x -14.\n\nNow, compute the y-term:\n\n6\u221a14/5 -5\u221a14/56. Let me find a common denominator, which is 280.\n\n6\u221a14/5 = (6\u221a14 *56)/280 = 336\u221a14/280.\n\n5\u221a14/56 = (5\u221a14 *5)/280 =25\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, 336\u221a14/280 -25\u221a14/280 = 311\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, the y-term is (311\u221a14/280)(y -5\u221a14/56).\n\nExpanding this:\n\n311\u221a14/280 * y - (311\u221a14/280)(5\u221a14/56).\n\nCompute the second term:\n\n(311\u221a14 *5\u221a14)/(280 *56) = (311 *5 *14)/(280 *56) = (311 *70)/(15680) = 21770/15680 = Simplify.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 70: 311/224.\n\nWait, 21770 \u00f770=311, 15680 \u00f770=224.\n\nSo, the second term is -311/224.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n(14/5)x -14 + (311\u221a14/280)y -311/224 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nThe right-hand side is (75\u221a14/56)^2 = 78750/3136, as computed earlier.\n\nSo, left-hand side:\n\n(14/5)x + (311\u221a14/280)y -14 -311/224 = 78750/3136.\n\nCompute constants:\n\n-14 is -3136/224.\n\n-311/224.\n\nSo, total constants: (-3136 -311)/224 = -3447/224.\n\nSo, equation is:\n\n(14/5)x + (311\u221a14/280)y -3447/224 =78750/3136.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3136 to eliminate denominators:\n\n(14/5)x *3136 + (311\u221a14/280)y *3136 -3447/224 *3136 =78750.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(14/5)x *3136 = (14*3136/5)x = (43904/5)x.\n\n(311\u221a14/280)y *3136 = (311\u221a14 *3136/280)y = 311\u221a14 *11.2 y = Wait, 3136 \u00f7280 = 11.2? Let me compute 3136 \u00f7280: 280*11=3080, 3136-3080=56, 56/280=0.2. So, 11.2. So, 311\u221a14 *11.2 y = 311*11.2\u221a14 y.\n\nBut 11.2 is 56/5. So, 311\u221a14*(56/5)y = (311*56\u221a14)/5 y.\n\n311*56: Let me compute 300*56=16800, 11*56=616, so total 16800+616=17416.\n\nSo, (17416\u221a14)/5 y.\n\nThird term: -3447/224 *3136 = -3447 * (3136/224) = -3447 *14 = -48258.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(43904/5)x + (17416\u221a14/5)y -48258 =78750.\n\nBring constants to the right:\n\n(43904/5)x + (17416\u221a14/5)y =78750 +48258 =127008.\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 to eliminate denominators:\n\n43904x +17416\u221a14 y =635040.\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n43904x +17416\u221a14 y =635040.\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy. Let me see if I can factor out some common terms.\n\nLooking at coefficients:\n\n43904, 17416, 635040.\n\nLet me see if they have a common factor. Let's try 8:\n\n43904 \u00f78=5488.\n\n17416 \u00f78=2177.\n\n635040 \u00f78=79380.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n5488x +2177\u221a14 y =79380.\n\nStill not very clean. Maybe 7?\n\n5488 \u00f77=784.\n\n2177 \u00f77=311.\n\n79380 \u00f77=11340.\n\nSo, equation now is:\n\n784x +311\u221a14 y =11340.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the tangent at B is 784x +311\u221a14 y =11340.\n\nNow, we have two equations for the two tangents:\n\n1. Tangent at C: 56x +\u221a14 y =0.\n\n2. Tangent at B:784x +311\u221a14 y =11340.\n\nWe need to find their intersection point D.\n\nSo, solve the system:\n\n56x +\u221a14 y =0. \u2192 Equation (a)\n\n784x +311\u221a14 y =11340. \u2192 Equation (b)\n\nLet me solve equation (a) for y:\n\n\u221a14 y = -56x \u2192 y = (-56/\u221a14)x.\n\nSimplify: 56/\u221a14 = (56\u221a14)/14 =4\u221a14. So, y= -4\u221a14 x.\n\nNow, substitute y into equation (b):\n\n784x +311\u221a14*(-4\u221a14 x) =11340.\n\nCompute the second term:\n\n311\u221a14*(-4\u221a14 x) = -4*311*(\u221a14)^2 x = -4*311*14 x = -4*4354 x = -17416 x.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n784x -17416x =11340 \u2192 (784 -17416)x =11340 \u2192 (-16632)x =11340 \u2192 x=11340 / (-16632).\n\nSimplify this fraction.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 12: 11340 \u00f712=945, 16632 \u00f712=1386.\n\nSo, x= -945/1386.\n\nSimplify further: both divided by 3: 945 \u00f73=315, 1386 \u00f73=462.\n\nx= -315/462.\n\nAgain, divide by 3: 315 \u00f73=105, 462 \u00f73=154.\n\nx= -105/154.\n\nAgain, divide by 7: 105 \u00f77=15, 154 \u00f77=22.\n\nx= -15/22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nThen, y= -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22) =60\u221a14/22 =30\u221a14/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, we need to find the equation of line AD.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nSo, the slope m of AD is (y_D - y_A)/(x_D - x_A) = (30\u221a14/11 -0)/(-15/22 -10) = (30\u221a14/11) / (-15/22 -220/22) = (30\u221a14/11) / (-235/22).\n\nSimplify:\n\n(30\u221a14/11) * (22/-235) = (30\u221a14 *22)/(11*(-235)).\n\nSimplify 30/11 and 22: 22/11=2, so 30*2=60.\n\nSo, 60\u221a14 / (-235) = -60\u221a14 /235.\n\nSimplify the fraction: 60 and 235 have a common factor of 5: 60 \u00f75=12, 235 \u00f75=47.\n\nSo, slope m= -12\u221a14 /47.\n\nSo, the equation of line AD is y -0 = m(x -10), so y= (-12\u221a14 /47)(x -10).\n\nNow, we need to find point P, which is the second intersection of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nWe already know that A is on both the line and the circle, so P is the other point.\n\nTo find P, we can solve the system of the line and the circle.\n\nThe equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y =0.\n\nThe equation of the line is y= (-12\u221a14 /47)(x -10).\n\nLet me substitute y into the circle equation.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 + [ (-12\u221a14 /47 (x -10) ) ]\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)(-12\u221a14 /47 (x -10)) =0.\n\nCompute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: x\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: [ (-12\u221a14 /47 (x -10) ) ]\u00b2 = (144*14)/(47\u00b2) (x -10)^2 = (2016)/(2209)(x\u00b2 -20x +100).\n\nThird term: -10x.\n\nFourth term: - (5\u221a14/28)(-12\u221a14 /47)(x -10) = (5\u221a14 *12\u221a14)/(28*47)(x -10).\n\nSimplify:\n\n(5*12*(\u221a14)^2)/(28*47)(x -10) = (60*14)/(1316)(x -10) = (840)/(1316)(x -10).\n\nSimplify 840/1316: divide numerator and denominator by 4: 210/329.\n\nSo, fourth term is (210/329)(x -10).\n\nNow, putting all terms together:\n\nx\u00b2 + (2016/2209)(x\u00b2 -20x +100) -10x + (210/329)(x -10) =0.\n\nLet me multiply through by 2209*329 to eliminate denominators. That's a bit heavy, but let me proceed.\n\nBut maybe it's better to compute each term step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use substitution.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute each coefficient.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nTerm1: x\u00b2.\n\nTerm2: (2016/2209)x\u00b2 - (2016*20/2209)x + (2016*100)/2209.\n\nTerm3: -10x.\n\nTerm4: (210/329)x - (210*10)/329.\n\nSo, combining all terms:\n\nx\u00b2 + (2016/2209)x\u00b2 - (40320/2209)x + (201600/2209) -10x + (210/329)x -2100/329 =0.\n\nNow, collect like terms:\n\nx\u00b2 terms: 1 + 2016/2209 = (2209 +2016)/2209 = 4225/2209.\n\nx terms: (-40320/2209 -10 +210/329).\n\nConstants: 201600/2209 -2100/329.\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst, x\u00b2 coefficient: 4225/2209.\n\nx terms:\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-40320/2209,\n\n-10 = -10*2209/2209 = -22090/2209,\n\n210/329 = 210*7/2209 = 1470/2209.\n\nWait, because 329*7=2203, wait no. 2209 is 47\u00b2=2209. 329= 7*47=329? 7*47=329? 7*40=280, 7*7=49, so 280+49=329. Yes.\n\nSo, 210/329 =210/(7*47)=30/47. Wait, but maybe better to write over 2209.\n\nWait, 2209 =47\u00b2=47*47.\n\n329=7*47.\n\nSo, 210/329 =210/(7*47)=30/47.\n\nSo, 30/47 =30*47/(47*47)=1410/2209.\n\nWait, no. To express 30/47 in terms of denominator 2209, we need to multiply numerator and denominator by 47: 30*47 / (47*47) =1410/2209.\n\nSo, x terms:\n\n-40320/2209 -22090/2209 +1410/2209 = (-40320 -22090 +1410)/2209.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n-40320 -22090 = -62410.\n\n-62410 +1410 = -61000.\n\nSo, x terms: -61000/2209.\n\nConstants:\n\n201600/2209 -2100/329.\n\nConvert 2100/329 to denominator 2209:\n\n329=7*47. 2209=47\u00b2=47*47.\n\nSo, 2100/329 =2100/(7*47)=300/47.\n\nConvert 300/47 to denominator 2209: multiply numerator and denominator by47: 300*47 /2209 =14100/2209.\n\nSo, constants:\n\n201600/2209 -14100/2209 = (201600 -14100)/2209 =187500/2209.\n\nSo, now, the equation becomes:\n\n(4225/2209)x\u00b2 - (61000/2209)x +187500/2209 =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2209 to eliminate denominators:\n\n4225x\u00b2 -61000x +187500 =0.\n\nSo, quadratic equation:4225x\u00b2 -61000x +187500=0.\n\nLet me try to solve this quadratic for x.\n\nQuadratic equation: ax\u00b2 +bx +c=0.\n\na=4225, b=-61000, c=187500.\n\nUse quadratic formula:\n\nx = [61000 \u00b1 sqrt(61000\u00b2 -4*4225*187500)]/(2*4225).\n\nCompute discriminant D=61000\u00b2 -4*4225*187500.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n61000\u00b2= (61*1000)^2=61\u00b2 *10^6=3721*10^6=3,721,000,000.\n\n4*4225*187500=4*4225=16900; 16900*187500.\n\nCompute 16900 *187500:\n\nFirst, 169 *1875= ?\n\nCompute 169 *1000=169,000.\n\n169 *800=135,200.\n\n169 *75=12,675.\n\nWait, wait, 1875=1000 +800 +75.\n\nWait, but 169*1875=169*(1000 +800 +75)=169*1000 +169*800 +169*75=169,000 +135,200 +12,675= 169,000 +135,200=304,200 +12,675=316,875.\n\nSo, 169*1875=316,875.\n\nThen, 16900 *187500=169*100 *1875*100= (169*1875)*(100*100)=316,875 *10,000=3,168,750,000.\n\nSo, D=3,721,000,000 -3,168,750,000=552,250,000.\n\nSo, sqrt(D)=sqrt(552,250,000).\n\nCompute sqrt(552250000):\n\nWell, 23500\u00b2= (235)^2 *100^2=55225 *10000=552,250,000.\n\nSo, sqrt(552,250,000)=23500.\n\nSo, x= [61000 \u00b123500]/(2*4225).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n61000 +23500=84500.\n\n61000 -23500=37500.\n\nSo, x=84500/(2*4225) and x=37500/(2*4225).\n\nCompute 2*4225=8450.\n\nSo,\n\nx=84500/8450=10.\n\nx=37500/8450=375/84.5= Let me compute 37500 \u00f78450.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 50: 750/169.\n\nSo, x=750/169.\n\nSo, the solutions are x=10 and x=750/169.\n\nSince point A is at (10,0), the other intersection point P must be at x=750/169.\n\nCompute y-coordinate for P.\n\nUsing the equation of line AD: y= (-12\u221a14 /47)(x -10).\n\nSo, when x=750/169,\n\ny= (-12\u221a14 /47)(750/169 -10) = (-12\u221a14 /47)(750/169 -1690/169) = (-12\u221a14 /47)(-940/169).\n\nCompute:\n\n(-12\u221a14 /47)*(-940/169) = (12*940\u221a14)/(47*169).\n\nSimplify:\n\n12 and 47: no common factors.\n\n940 \u00f747=20, because 47*20=940.\n\nSo, 940=47*20.\n\nSo, numerator:12*47*20\u221a14.\n\nDenominator:47*169.\n\nCancel 47:\n\n12*20\u221a14 /169 =240\u221a14 /169.\n\nSo, y=240\u221a14 /169.\n\nThus, point P is at (750/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nNow, we need to find the length AP.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point P is at (750/169,240\u221a14/169).\n\nCompute distance AP.\n\nDistance formula: sqrt[(x_P -x_A)^2 + (y_P -y_A)^2].\n\nCompute x_P -x_A=750/169 -10=750/169 -1690/169= (750 -1690)/169= (-940)/169.\n\ny_P -y_A=240\u221a14/169 -0=240\u221a14/169.\n\nSo,\n\nAP= sqrt[ (-940/169)^2 + (240\u221a14/169)^2 ].\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(-940/169)^2= (940\u00b2)/(169\u00b2)=883600/28561.\n\n(240\u221a14/169)^2= (240\u00b2 *14)/(169\u00b2)= (57600 *14)/28561= 806400/28561.\n\nSo, AP\u00b2=883600/28561 +806400/28561= (883600 +806400)/28561=1,690,000/28561.\n\nSimplify sqrt(1,690,000/28561)=sqrt(1,690,000)/sqrt(28561).\n\nCompute sqrt(1,690,000): sqrt(1,690,000)=sqrt(1690000)=1300.\n\nsqrt(28561)=169, since 169\u00b2=28561.\n\nSo, AP=1300/169.\n\nSimplify 1300/169: 169*7=1183, 169*7=1183, 1300-1183=117. 169*7 +117=1300. Wait, 169*7=1183. 1300-1183=117.\n\nWait, 169*7=1183, 1183+117=1300.

So, AP=100/13.\n\nSo, written as m/n=100/13, which is reduced because 100 and 13 share no common factors besides 1.\n\nThus, m=100, n=13, m +n=113.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that triangle \\(ABC\\) has sides \\(AB = 5\\), \\(BC = 9\\), and \\(AC = 10\\). We are tasked with finding the length \\(AP\\), where \\(P\\) is the second intersection of line \\(AD\\) with the circumcircle \\(\\omega\\) of triangle \\(ABC\\), and \\(D\\) is the intersection of the tangents to \\(\\omega\\) at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\).\n\nFirst, we compute the semiperimeter \\(s\\) and area \\(K\\) of triangle \\(ABC\\) using Heron's formula:\n\\[\ns = \\frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12\n\\]\n\\[\nK = \\sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)} = \\sqrt{12 \\times 7 \\times 3 \\times 2} = 6\\sqrt{14}\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the circumradius \\(R\\) of triangle \\(ABC\\):\n\\[\nR = \\frac{AB \\times BC \\times AC}{4K} = \\frac{5 \\times 9 \\times 10}{4 \\times 6\\sqrt{14}} = \\frac{75\\sqrt{14}}{56}\n\\]\n\nWe place triangle \\(ABC\\) in a coordinate system with \\(C\\) at the origin \\((0, 0)\\), \\(A\\) at \\((10, 0)\\), and \\(B\\) at \\((\\frac{39}{5}, \\frac{6\\sqrt{14}}{5})\\). Using the coordinates, we determine the equations of the tangents at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) to the circumcircle \\(\\omega\\). Solving these equations gives the coordinates of point \\(D\\) as \\(\\left(-\\frac{15}{22}, \\frac{30\\sqrt{14}}{11}\\right)\\).\n\nThe equation of line \\(AD\\) is found using the slope between \\(A\\) and \\(D\\), resulting in:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-12\\sqrt{14}}{47}(x - 10)\n\\]\n\nWe substitute this into the equation of the circumcircle to find the coordinates of point \\(P\\). Solving the resulting quadratic equation, we find the \\(x\\)-coordinate of \\(P\\) to be \\(\\frac{750}{169}\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. \n\nWe have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents to \u03c9 at B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects \u03c9 again at point P. We're given the lengths AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find AP expressed as a reduced fraction m/n and then compute m + n.\n\nFirst, I should probably sketch the figure to visualize everything. Let me describe it mentally. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle \u03c9 is the circumcircle of ABC. Tangents at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole or something? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.\n\nSince D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, it's called the exsymmedian point or maybe the symmedian point? Wait, no, the symmedian point is where the symmedians meet. Hmm. Alternatively, D is the ex-pole with respect to BC. Not sure. Maybe I should recall that the tangent at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole, so D lies on the circumcircle's tangent lines.\n\nAnother thought: since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, BD and CD are tangent to \u03c9. So, BD = CD because they're both tangents from D to \u03c9. That might be useful.\n\nWe have point D outside the circle, and line AD intersects the circle again at P. So, AP is part of AD. We need to find the length AP.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps I can use power of a point here. The Power of a Point theorem states that for point D outside the circle, the square of the tangent length is equal to the product of the lengths from D to the points where a secant passes through the circle.\n\nIn other words, since D is outside \u03c9 and AD is a secant intersecting \u03c9 at A and P, then:\n\nDB^2 = DA * DP\n\nWait, actually, no. The Power of a Point formula is DB^2 = DA * DP. Because DB is the tangent, so its square equals the product of the entire secant segment (DA) and its external part (DP). Wait, let me get this right.\n\nActually, the power of D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB^2 = DC^2, since both are tangent lengths. So, DB = DC, as tangents from a single external point to a circle are equal. \n\nSo, the power of D is DB^2 = DC^2 = DA * DP.\n\nSo, if I can find DA, then I can express DP in terms of DA. Then, since AP = AD - DP, or perhaps AP = DP - AD? Wait, let me think. If AD is the secant from D passing through A and then P, then the points are D, A, P on the line. So, DA is from D to A, and DP is from D to P, but since P is on the circle and beyond A, DA is shorter than DP. So, DP = DA + AP? Wait, no, because A is between D and P. So, the order is D, then A, then P. So, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is from D to P, so DP = DA + AP. Therefore, AP = DP - DA.\n\nBut according to the power of a point, DB^2 = DA * DP. So, if I can find DA, then DP = DB^2 / DA. Then, AP = DP - DA = (DB^2 / DA) - DA.\n\nSo, AP = (DB^2 - DA^2) / DA.\n\nBut I don't know DA yet. Hmm. So, perhaps I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find coordinates for everything. Let me think. Maybe coordinate geometry could help here.\n\nLet me place the triangle ABC in a coordinate system to make calculations easier. Since AC is 10 units, maybe I can place point A at (0,0) and point C at (10,0). Then, point B will be somewhere in the plane. Let's calculate the coordinates of B using the given side lengths.\n\nGiven AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10.\n\nSo, points A(0,0), C(10,0). Let\u2019s find coordinates of B.\n\nLet\u2019s denote B as (x,y). Then, distance from A to B is 5:\n\n\u221a(x^2 + y^2) = 5 => x^2 + y^2 = 25. (1)\n\nDistance from B to C is 9:\n\n\u221a((x - 10)^2 + y^2) = 9 => (x -10)^2 + y^2 = 81. (2)\n\nSubtracting equation (1) from (2):\n\n(x -10)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 81 -25 => (x^2 -20x +100) -x^2 = 56 => -20x +100 =56 => -20x = -44 => x= 44/20 = 11/5 = 2.2.\n\nThen, from equation (1): x^2 + y^2 =25 => (121/25) + y^2 =25 => y^2=25 -121/25 = (625 -121)/25 = 504/25 => y=\u221a(504)/5 = \u221a(16*31.5)/5= wait, 504=16*31.5? Wait, 16*31 is 496, 16*31.5 is 504. So, 504=16*31.5=16* (63/2). So, \u221a(504)=\u221a(16*63/2)=4*\u221a(63/2)=4*(\u221a63)/\u221a2=4*(3\u221a7)/\u221a2=12\u221a7 / \u221a2=12\u221a14 / 2=6\u221a14.\n\nWait, wait, let's compute it correctly.\n\n504 = 16 * 31.5? Let me see 16*31=496, 16*31.5=504. So, 504=16*(63/2)= (16*63)/2= (1008)/2=504. So, \u221a504=\u221a(16*63/2)=\u221a16 * \u221a(63/2)=4*\u221a(63/2). Alternatively, 63/2=31.5, but maybe we can factor 63 as 9*7, so \u221a(63/2)= 3\u221a(7/2). So, overall, \u221a504=4*3\u221a(7/2)=12\u221a(7/2). Hmm, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can just keep it as \u221a(504/25)= (\u221a504)/5.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute y^2=504/25, so y= (\u221a504)/5. Simplify \u221a504:\n\n504= 16*31.5=16* (63/2)= (16*63)/2= (1008)/2=504. Hmm, 63=9*7, so \u221a504=\u221a(16*63/2)=4*\u221a(63/2)=4*\u221a(9*7/2)=4*3*\u221a(7/2)=12\u221a(7/2). Hmm, okay.\n\nSo, y=12\u221a(7/2)/5. Let me rationalize that:\n\n\u221a(7/2)=\u221a14 / \u221a4=\u221a14 / 2? Wait, no. Wait, \u221a(7/2)=\u221a14 / \u221a4=\u221a14 / 2? Wait, no. Wait, \u221a(a/b)=\u221a(a)/\u221a(b). So, \u221a(7/2)=\u221a7 / \u221a2= (\u221a14)/2.\n\nSo, y=12*(\u221a14 / 2)/5= (6\u221a14)/5.\n\nSo, coordinates of B are (11/5, 6\u221a14/5). So, (2.2, (6\u221a14)/5).\n\nOkay, so now I have coordinates for A, B, C:\n\nA(0,0), C(10,0), B(11/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nNow, I need to find the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC. To find the equation of the circumcircle, I can find the circumradius and the center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using the coordinates.\n\nLet me denote the circumcircle as passing through points A(0,0), B(11/5, 6\u221a14/5), C(10,0). Let me find the equation of the circle passing through these three points.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F =0.\n\nSince A(0,0) is on the circle: 0 +0 +0 +0 +F=0 => F=0.\n\nSo, the equation becomes x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey =0.\n\nNow, plug in point C(10,0):\n\n10^2 +0^2 + D*10 + E*0 =0 => 100 +10D=0 => 10D= -100 => D= -10.\n\nSo, equation is x^2 + y^2 -10x + Ey=0.\n\nNow, plug in point B(11/5, 6\u221a14/5):\n\n(11/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 -10*(11/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5)=0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(121/25) + (36*14)/25 - (110/5) + (6\u221a14 E)/5=0.\n\nCalculate 36*14: 36*14=504.\n\nSo, 121/25 + 504/25 - 22 + (6\u221a14 E)/5=0.\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n(121 +504)/25 -22 + (6\u221a14 E)/5=0 => 625/25 -22 + ... => 25 -22 + ... => 3 + (6\u221a14 E)/5=0.\n\nSo, 3 + (6\u221a14 E)/5=0 => (6\u221a14 E)/5= -3 => E= (-3 *5)/(6\u221a14)= (-15)/(6\u221a14)= (-5)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\nE= (-5)/(2\u221a14) * (\u221a14/\u221a14)= (-5\u221a14)/(28).\n\nSo, E= (-5\u221a14)/28.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the circumcircle is x^2 + y^2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y =0.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy, but okay.\n\nNow, next step: find point D, the intersection of tangents at B and C.\n\nWait, tangents at B and C to the circumcircle.\n\nI remember that the tangent to a circle at a point (x1, y1) on the circle x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F=0 is given by:\n\nxx1 + yy1 + (D(x +x1))/2 + (E(y + y1))/2 + F =0.\n\nWait, is that correct? Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the tangent at a point on the circle.\n\nAnother approach: The equation of the tangent at point (x1,y1) on the circle x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F=0 is xx1 + yy1 + (D(x +x1))/2 + (E(y + y1))/2 + F =0.\n\nWait, actually, the general equation for the tangent at (x1,y1) is:\n\nT: x x1 + y y1 + (D(x + x1))/2 + (E(y + y1))/2 + F =0.\n\nBut in our case, since F=0, it simplifies.\n\nSo, for point B(11/5, 6\u221a14/5):\n\nThe tangent at B is:\n\nx*(11/5) + y*(6\u221a14/5) + (D(x +11/5))/2 + (E(y +6\u221a14/5))/2 =0.\n\nWe know D= -10, E= (-5\u221a14)/28.\n\nPlugging in D and E:\n\nx*(11/5) + y*(6\u221a14/5) + (-10)(x +11/5)/2 + (-5\u221a14/28)(y +6\u221a14/5)/2 =0.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (11/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y.\n\nSecond term: (-10/2)(x +11/5) = -5(x +11/5)= -5x -11.\n\nThird term: (-5\u221a14/28)/2 (y +6\u221a14/5) = (-5\u221a14/56)(y +6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(11/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y -5x -11 - (5\u221a14/56)y - (5\u221a14/56)(6\u221a14/5) =0.\n\nNow, let's combine like terms.\n\nFirst, collect x terms:\n\n(11/5)x -5x = (11/5 -25/5)x = (-14/5)x.\n\nNext, y terms:\n\n(6\u221a14/5)y - (5\u221a14/56)y.\n\nTo combine these, find a common denominator. 5 and 56 have LCM of 280.\n\nSo, 6\u221a14/5 = (6\u221a14 *56)/280 = (336\u221a14)/280.\n\n5\u221a14/56 = (5\u221a14 *5)/280 = (25\u221a14)/280.\n\nSo, subtracting: (336\u221a14 -25\u221a14)/280 = (311\u221a14)/280.\n\nSo, y term is (311\u221a14/280)y.\n\nConstant terms:\n\n-11 - (5\u221a14/56)(6\u221a14/5).\n\nCompute the second part: (5\u221a14 *6\u221a14)/(56*5).\n\nMultiply numerator: 5*6=30; \u221a14*\u221a14=14. So, numerator is 30*14=420.\n\nDenominator: 56*5=280.\n\nSo, that term is 420/280= 3/2.\n\nSo, the constant terms are -11 - 3/2= (-22/2 -3/2)= -25/2.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n(-14/5)x + (311\u221a14/280)y -25/2=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 280 to eliminate denominators:\n\n(-14/5)x *280 + (311\u221a14)y -25/2 *280 =0.\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n-14/5 *280= -14*56= -784.\n\n311\u221a14 remains as is.\n\n-25/2 *280= -25*140= -3500.\n\nSo, equation is:\n\n-784x +311\u221a14 y -3500=0.\n\nHmm, that's the tangent at B.\n\nSimilarly, let's find the tangent at C(10,0).\n\nUsing the same formula:\n\nx*10 + y*0 + (D(x +10))/2 + (E(y +0))/2 =0.\n\nWait, general tangent equation:\n\nxx1 + yy1 + (D(x +x1))/2 + (E(y +y1))/2 +F=0.\n\nHere, x1=10, y1=0, D=-10, E=(-5\u221a14)/28, F=0.\n\nSo, the tangent at C is:\n\nx*10 + y*0 + (-10)(x +10)/2 + (-5\u221a14/28)(y +0)/2 =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n10x +0 + (-10/2)(x +10) + (-5\u221a14/56)y=0.\n\nWhich is:\n\n10x -5(x +10) - (5\u221a14/56)y =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n10x -5x -50 - (5\u221a14/56)y=0 => 5x -50 - (5\u221a14/56)y=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 56 to eliminate denominators:\n\n5x*56 -50*56 -5\u221a14 y=0 => 280x -2800 -5\u221a14 y=0.\n\nRearranged: 280x -5\u221a14 y -2800=0.\n\nSo, now we have two tangent equations:\n\n1. From B: -784x +311\u221a14 y -3500=0.\n\n2. From C: 280x -5\u221a14 y -2800=0.\n\nWe need to find their intersection point D.\n\nSo, solve the system:\n\nEquation 1: -784x +311\u221a14 y =3500.\n\nEquation 2: 280x -5\u221a14 y =2800.\n\nLet me write them as:\n\n-784x +311\u221a14 y =3500. (1)\n\n280x -5\u221a14 y =2800. (2)\n\nLet me try to eliminate y. Let's solve equation (2) for y.\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\n280x -5\u221a14 y =2800 => -5\u221a14 y = -280x +2800 => y = (280x -2800)/(5\u221a14) = (56x -560)/\u221a14.\n\nSimplify numerator: 56(x -10).\n\nSo, y=56(x -10)/\u221a14.\n\nSimplify 56/\u221a14: 56=14*4, so 56/\u221a14= (14*4)/\u221a14=4\u221a14.\n\nBecause (14)/\u221a14=\u221a14.\n\nSo, y=4\u221a14 (x -10).\n\nSo, y=4\u221a14 x -40\u221a14.\n\nNow, substitute this into equation (1):\n\n-784x +311\u221a14 y =3500.\n\nPlug y:\n\n-784x +311\u221a14 (4\u221a14 x -40\u221a14) =3500.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: -784x.\n\nSecond term: 311\u221a14 *4\u221a14 x =311*4*(\u221a14)^2 x=311*4*14 x.\n\nSimilarly, 311\u221a14*(-40\u221a14)=311*(-40)*(\u221a14)^2=311*(-40)*14.\n\nSo, let's compute:\n\n311*4*14= 311*56= Let me compute 300*56=16800, 11*56=616, total=16800+616=17416.\n\nSimilarly, 311*(-40)*14=311*(-560)= Let me compute 300*(-560)= -168000, 11*(-560)= -6160, total= -168000 -6160= -174160.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n-784x +17416x -174160=3500.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-784 +17416)x = (17416 -784)x= 16632x.\n\nSo, 16632x -174160=3500.\n\nBring constants to the other side:\n\n16632x=3500 +174160=177660.\n\nSo, x=177660 /16632.\n\nSimplify this fraction.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 12:\n\n177660 \u00f712=14805.\n\n16632 \u00f712=1386.\n\nSo, 14805 /1386.\n\nCheck if they can be divided further.\n\nLet me see, 14805 \u00f73=4935; 1386 \u00f73=462.\n\nSo, 4935 /462.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3 again: 4935 \u00f73=1645; 462 \u00f73=154.\n\n1645 /154.\n\nCheck if they can be divided further.\n\n1645 \u00f77=235; 154 \u00f77=22.\n\nSo, 235/22.\n\nSo, x=235/22.\n\nNow, substitute x into y=4\u221a14 (x -10):\n\ny=4\u221a14 (235/22 -10)=4\u221a14 (235/22 -220/22)=4\u221a14 (15/22)= (60\u221a14)/22= (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (235/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, we need to find the equation of line AD. Since A is at (0,0) and D is at (235/22, 30\u221a14/11), the parametric equations can be written as:\n\nx= (235/22)t\n\ny= (30\u221a14/11)t\n\nwhere t ranges from 0 to 1 for segment AD, and beyond for the extended line.\n\nWe need to find where this line intersects the circumcircle \u03c9 again at point P.\n\nThe equation of the circumcircle is x^2 + y^2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y =0.\n\nSubstitute x= (235/22)t, y= (30\u221a14/11)t into the circle equation.\n\nSo, [(235/22 t)^2 + (30\u221a14/11 t)^2 ] -10*(235/22 t) - (5\u221a14/28)*(30\u221a14/11 t)=0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (235/22)^2 t^2 + (30\u221a14/11)^2 t^2.\n\nSecond term: -10*(235/22)t.\n\nThird term: - (5\u221a14/28)*(30\u221a14/11) t.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nCompute first term:\n\n(235/22)^2 = (235)^2 / (22)^2. 235^2= (200+35)^2=200^2 +2*200*35 +35^2=40000 +14000 +1225=55225.\n\n(22)^2=484.\n\nSo, (235/22)^2=55225/484.\n\n(30\u221a14/11)^2= (900*14)/121=12600/121.\n\nSo, first term is (55225/484 + 12600/121) t^2.\n\nNote that 12600/121= (12600*4)/484=50400/484.\n\nSo, total first term: (55225 +50400)/484 t^2=105625/484 t^2.\n\nSecond term: -10*(235/22)t= -2350/22 t= -1175/11 t.\n\nThird term: - (5\u221a14/28)*(30\u221a14/11) t.\n\nMultiply the constants:\n\n5*30=150.\n\n\u221a14*\u221a14=14.\n\nDenominator:28*11=308.\n\nSo, the term is - (150*14)/308 t= -2100/308 t.\n\nSimplify 2100/308: divide numerator and denominator by 28: 2100 \u00f728=75, 308 \u00f728=11.\n\nSo, 75/11.\n\nThus, the third term is -75/11 t.\n\nPutting all together:\n\n105625/484 t^2 -1175/11 t -75/11 t =0.\n\nCombine the linear terms:\n\n-1175/11 t -75/11 t = -1250/11 t.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n105625/484 t^2 -1250/11 t=0.\n\nMultiply through by 484 to eliminate denominators:\n\n105625 t^2 - (1250/11)*484 t=0.\n\nCompute (1250/11)*484:\n\n1250 *484= let me compute 1250*400=500,000; 1250*84=105,000; total=605,000.\n\nDivide by 11: 605,000 /11=55,000.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n105625 t^2 -55000 t=0.\n\nFactor t:\n\nt (105625 t -55000)=0.\n\nSo, solutions t=0 and t=55000/105625.\n\nSimplify 55000/105625.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25: 55000 \u00f725=2200; 105625 \u00f725=4225.\n\nSo, 2200/4225.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 2200 \u00f75=440; 4225 \u00f75=845.\n\nSo, 440/845.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5 again: 440 \u00f75=88; 845 \u00f75=169.\n\nSo, 88/169.\n\nCheck if 88 and 169 have common factors: 88 factors are 8*11, 169 is 13^2. So, co-prime.\n\nThus, t=88/169.\n\nTherefore, point P corresponds to t=88/169.\n\nSo, the coordinates of P are:\n\nx= (235/22)*(88/169)= (235 *88)/(22*169).\n\nSimplify 88/22=4, so x=235 *4 /169=940/169.\n\nSimilarly, y= (30\u221a14/11)*(88/169)= (30\u221a14 *88)/(11*169).\n\nSimplify 88/11=8, so y=30\u221a14 *8 /169=240\u221a14 /169.\n\nSo, point P is at (940/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nNow, we need to compute AP.\n\nPoint A is at (0,0), P is at (940/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nSo, distance AP is sqrt[(940/169)^2 + (240\u221a14/169)^2].\n\nFactor out (1/169)^2:\n\nsqrt[(940^2 + (240\u221a14)^2)/169^2] = sqrt[(940^2 + 240^2 *14)]/169.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n940^2 = (900+40)^2=900^2 + 2*900*40 +40^2=810000 +72000 +1600=883600.\n\n240^2=57600.\n\n57600*14=806400.\n\nSo, numerator inside sqrt:883600 +806400=1,690,000.\n\nSo, sqrt(1,690,000)=1300.\n\nThus, AP=1300 /169.\n\nSimplify 1300/169.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 13: 1300 \u00f713=100; 169 \u00f713=13.\n\nSo, 100/13.\n\nSo, AP=100/13.\n\nThus, m=100, n=13. They are coprime.\n\nSo, m +n=113.\n",

Solving these equations, we determine the coordinates of point \\(D\\) to be \\(\\left(\\frac{235}{22}, \\frac{30\\sqrt{14}}{11}\\right)\\).\n\nThe line \\(AD\\) is parameterized, and we substitute this parameterization into the circumcircle equation to find the intersection point \\(P\\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. \n\nWe have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents to \u03c9 at B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects \u03c9 again at point P. We're given the lengths AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find AP expressed as a reduced fraction m/n and then compute m + n.\n\nFirst, I should probably sketch the figure to visualize everything. Let me describe it mentally. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle \u03c9 is the circumcircle of ABC. Tangents at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole or something? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.\n\nSince D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, it's called the exsymmedian point or maybe the symmedian point? Wait, no, the symmedian point is where the symmedians meet. Hmm. Alternatively, D is the ex-pole with respect to BC. Not sure. Maybe I should recall that the tangent at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole, so D lies on the circumcircle's tangent lines.\n\nAnother thought: since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, BD and CD are tangent to \u03c9. So, BD = CD because they're both tangents from D to \u03c9. That might be useful.\n\nWe have point D outside the circle, and line AD intersects the circle again at P. So, AP is part of AD. We need to find the length AP.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps I can use power of a point here. The Power of a Point theorem states that for point D outside the circle, the square of the tangent length is equal to the product of the lengths from D to the points where a secant passes through the circle.\n\nIn other words, since D is outside \u03c9 and AD is a secant intersecting \u03c9 at A and P, then:\n\nDB^2 = DA * DP\n\nWait, actually, no. The Power of a Point formula is DB^2 = DA * DP. Because DB is the tangent, so its square equals the product of the entire secant segment (DA) and its external part (DP). Wait, let me get this right.\n\nActually, the power of D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB^2 = DC^2, since both are tangent lengths. So, DB = DC, as tangents from a single external point to a circle are equal. \n\nSo, the power of D is DB^2 = DC^2 = DA * DP.\n\nSo, if I can find DA, then I can express DP in terms of DA. Then, since AP = AD - DP, or perhaps AP = DP - AD? Wait, let me think. If AD is the secant from D passing through A and then P, then the points are D, A, P on the line. So, DA is from D to A, and DP is from D to P, but since P is on the circle and beyond A, DA is shorter than DP. So, DP = DA + AP? Wait, no, because A is between D and P. So, the order is D, then A, then P. So, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is from D to P, so DP = DA + AP. Therefore, AP = DP - DA.\n\nBut according to the power of a point, DB^2 = DA * DP. So, if I can find DA, then DP = DB^2 / DA. Then, AP = DP - DA = (DB^2 / DA) - DA.\n\nSo, AP = (DB^2 - DA^2) / DA.\n\nBut I don't know DA yet. Hmm. So, perhaps I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find coordinates for everything. Let me think. Maybe coordinate geometry could help here.\n\nLet me place the triangle ABC in a coordinate system to make calculations easier. Since AC is 10 units, maybe I can place point A at (0,0) and point C at (10,0). Then, point B will be somewhere in the plane. Let's calculate the coordinates of B using the given side lengths.\n\nGiven AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10.\n\nSo, points A(0,0), C(10,0). Let\u2019s find coordinates of B.\n\nLet\u2019s denote B as (x,y). Then, distance from A to B is 5:\n\n\u221a(x^2 + y^2) = 5 => x^2 + y^2 = 25. (1)\n\nDistance from B to C is 9:\n\n\u221a((x - 10)^2 + y^2) = 9 => (x -10)^2 + y^2 = 81. (2)\n\nSubtracting equation (1) from (2):\n\n(x -10)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 81 -25 => (x^2 -20x +100) -x^2 = 56 => -20x +100 =56 => -20x = -44 => x= 44/20 = 11/5 = 2.2.\n\nThen, from equation (1): x^2 + y^2 =25 => (121/25) + y^2 =25 => y^2=25 -121/25 = (625 -121)/25 = 504/25 => y=\u221a(504)/5 = \u221a(16*31.5)/5= wait, 504=16*31.5? Wait, 16*31 is 496, 16*31.5 is 504. So, 504=16*31.5=16* (63/2). So, \u221a(504)=\u221a(16*63/2)=4*\u221a(63/2)=4*(\u221a63)/\u221a2=4*(3\u221a7)/\u221a2=12\u221a7 / \u221a2=12\u221a14 / 2=6\u221a14.\n\nWait, wait, let's compute it correctly.\n\n504 = 16 * 31.5? Let me see 16*31=496, 16*31.5=504. So, 504=16*(63/2)= (16*63)/2= (1008)/2=504. So, \u221a504=\u221a(16*63/2)=\u221a16 * \u221a(63/2)=4*\u221a(63/2). Alternatively, 63/2=31.5, but maybe we can factor 63 as 9*7, so \u221a(63/2)= 3\u221a(7/2). So, overall, \u221a504=4*3\u221a(7/2)=12\u221a(7/2). Hmm, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can just keep it as \u221a(504/25)= (\u221a504)/5.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute y^2=504/25, so y= (\u221a504)/5. Simplify \u221a504:\n\n504= 16*31.5=16* (63/2)= (16*63)/2= (1008)/2=504. Hmm, 63=9*7, so \u221a504=\u221a(16*63/2)=4*\u221a(63/2)=4*\u221a(9*7/2)=4*3*\u221a(7/2)=12\u221a(7/2). Hmm, okay.\n\nSo, y=12\u221a(7/2)/5. Let me rationalize that:\n\n\u221a(7/2)=\u221a14 / \u221a4=\u221a14 / 2? Wait, no. Wait, \u221a(7/2)=\u221a14 / \u221a4=\u221a14 / 2? Wait, no. Wait, \u221a(a/b)=\u221a(a)/\u221a(b). So, \u221a(7/2)=\u221a7 / \u221a2= (\u221a14)/2.\n\nSo, y=12*(\u221a14 / 2)/5= (6\u221a14)/5.\n\nSo, coordinates of B are (11/5, 6\u221a14/5). So, (2.2, (6\u221a14)/5).\n\nOkay, so now I have coordinates for A, B, C:\n\nA(0,0), C(10,0), B(11/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nNow, I need to find the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC. To find the equation of the circumcircle, I can find the circumradius and the center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using the coordinates.\n\nLet me denote the circumcircle as passing through points A(0,0), B(11/5, 6\u221a14/5), C(10,0). Let me find the equation of the circle passing through these three points.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F =0.\n\nSince A(0,0) is on the circle: 0 +0 +0 +0 +F=0 => F=0.\n\nSo, the equation becomes x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey =0.\n\nNow, plug in point C(10,0):\n\n10^2 +0^2 + D*10 + E*0 =0 => 100 +10D=0 => 10D= -100 => D= -10.\n\nSo, equation is x^2 + y^2 -10x + Ey=0.\n\nNow, plug in point B(11/5, 6\u221a14/5):\n\n(11/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 -10*(11/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5)=0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(121/25) + (36*14)/25 - (110/5) + (6\u221a14 E)/5=0.\n\nCalculate 36*14: 36*14=504.\n\nSo, 121/25 + 504/25 - 22 + (6\u221a14 E)/5=0.\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n(121 +504)/25 -22 + (6\u221a14 E)/5=0 => 625/25 -22 + ... => 25 -22 + ... => 3 + (6\u221a14 E)/5=0.\n\nSo, 3 + (6\u221a14 E)/5=0 => (6\u221a14 E)/5= -3 => E= (-3 *5)/(6\u221a14)= (-15)/(6\u221a14)= (-5)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\nE= (-5)/(2\u221a14) * (\u221a14/\u221a14)= (-5\u221a14)/(28).\n\nSo, E= (-5\u221a14)/28.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the circumcircle is x^2 + y^2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y =0.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy, but okay.\n\nNow, next step: find point D, the intersection of tangents at B and C.\n\nWait, tangents at B and C to the circumcircle.\n\nI remember that the tangent to a circle at a point (x1, y1) on the circle x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F=0 is given by:\n\nxx1 + yy1 + (D(x +x1))/2 + (E(y + y1))/2 + F =0.\n\nWait, is that correct? Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the tangent at a point on the circle.\n\nAnother approach: The equation of the tangent at point (x1,y1) on the circle x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F=0 is xx1 + yy1 + (D(x +x1))/2 + (E(y + y1))/2 + F =0.\n\nWait, actually, the general equation for the tangent at (x1,y1) is:\n\nT: x x1 + y y1 + (D(x + x1))/2 + (E(y + y1))/2 + F =0.\n\nBut in our case, since F=0, it simplifies.\n\nSo, for point B(11/5, 6\u221a14/5):\n\nThe tangent at B is:\n\nx*(11/5) + y*(6\u221a14/5) + (D(x +11/5))/2 + (E(y +6\u221a14/5))/2 =0.\n\nWe know D= -10, E= (-5\u221a14)/28.\n\nPlugging in D and E:\n\nx*(11/5) + y*(6\u221a14/5) + (-10)(x +11/5)/2 + (-5\u221a14/28)(y +6\u221a14/5)/2 =0.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (11/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y.\n\nSecond term: (-10/2)(x +11/5) = -5(x +11/5)= -5x -11.\n\nThird term: (-5\u221a14/28)/2 (y +6\u221a14/5) = (-5\u221a14/56)(y +6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(11/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y -5x -11 - (5\u221a14/56)y - (5\u221a14/56)(6\u221a14/5) =0.\n\nNow, let's combine like terms.\n\nFirst, collect x terms:\n\n(11/5)x -5x = (11/5 -25/5)x = (-14/5)x.\n\nNext, y terms:\n\n(6\u221a14/5)y - (5\u221a14/56)y.\n\nTo combine these, find a common denominator. 5 and 56 have LCM of 280.\n\nSo, 6\u221a14/5 = (6\u221a14 *56)/280 = (336\u221a14)/280.\n\n5\u221a14/56 = (5\u221a14 *5)/280 = (25\u221a14)/280.\n\nSo, subtracting: (336\u221a14 -25\u221a14)/280 = (311\u221a14)/280.\n\nSo, y term is (311\u221a14/280)y.\n\nConstant terms:\n\n-11 - (5\u221a14/56)(6\u221a14/5).\n\nCompute the second part: (5\u221a14 *6\u221a14)/(56*5).\n\nMultiply numerator: 5*6=30; \u221a14*\u221a14=14. So, numerator is 30*14=420.\n\nDenominator: 56*5=280.\n\nSo, that term is 420/280= 3/2.\n\nSo, the constant terms are -11 - 3/2= (-22/2 -3/2)= -25/2.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n(-14/5)x + (311\u221a14/280)y -25/2=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 280 to eliminate denominators:\n\n(-14/5)x *280 + (311\u221a14)y -25/2 *280 =0.\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n-14/5 *280= -14*56= -784.\n\n311\u221a14 remains as is.\n\n-25/2 *280= -25*140= -3500.\n\nSo, equation is:\n\n-784x +311\u221a14 y -3500=0.\n\nHmm, that's the tangent at B.\n\nSimilarly, let's find the tangent at C(10,0).\n\nUsing the same formula:\n\nx*10 + y*0 + (D(x +10))/2 + (E(y +0))/2 =0.\n\nWait, general tangent equation:\n\nxx1 + yy1 + (D(x +x1))/2 + (E(y +y1))/2 +F=0.\n\nHere, x1=10, y1=0, D=-10, E=(-5\u221a14)/28, F=0.\n\nSo, the tangent at C is:\n\nx*10 + y*0 + (-10)(x +10)/2 + (-5\u221a14/28)(y +0)/2 =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n10x +0 + (-10/2)(x +10) + (-5\u221a14/56)y=0.\n\nWhich is:\n\n10x -5(x +10) - (5\u221a14/56)y =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n10x -5x -50 - (5\u221a14/56)y=0 => 5x -50 - (5\u221a14/56)y=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 56 to eliminate denominators:\n\n5x*56 -50*56 -5\u221a14 y=0 => 280x -2800 -5\u221a14 y=0.\n\nRearranged: 280x -5\u221a14 y -2800=0.\n\nSo, now we have two tangent equations:\n\n1. From B: -784x +311\u221a14 y -3500=0.\n\n2. From C: 280x -5\u221a14 y -2800=0.\n\nWe need to find their intersection point D.\n\nSo, solve the system:\n\nEquation 1: -784x +311\u221a14 y =3500.\n\nEquation 2: 280x -5\u221a14 y =2800.\n\nLet me write them as:\n\n-784x +311\u221a14 y =3500. (1)\n\n280x -5\u221a14 y =2800. (2)\n\nLet me try to eliminate y. Let's solve equation (2) for y.\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\n280x -5\u221a14 y =2800 => -5\u221a14 y = -280x +2800 => y = (280x -2800)/(5\u221a14) = (56x -560)/\u221a14.\n\nSimplify numerator: 56(x -10).\n\nSo, y=56(x -10)/\u221a14.\n\nSimplify 56/\u221a14: 56=14*4, so 56/\u221a14= (14*4)/\u221a14=4\u221a14.\n\nBecause (14)/\u221a14=\u221a14.\n\nSo, y=4\u221a14 (x -10).\n\nSo, y=4\u221a14 x -40\u221a14.\n\nNow, substitute this into equation (1):\n\n-784x +311\u221a14 y =3500.\n\nPlug y:\n\n-784x +311\u221a14 (4\u221a14 x -40\u221a14) =3500.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: -784x.\n\nSecond term: 311\u221a14 *4\u221a14 x =311*4*(\u221a14)^2 x=311*4*14 x.\n\nSimilarly, 311\u221a14*(-40\u221a14)=311*(-40)*(\u221a14)^2=311*(-40)*14.\n\nSo, let's compute:\n\n311*4*14= 311*56= Let me compute 300*56=16800, 11*56=616, total=16800+616=17416.\n\nSimilarly, 311*(-40)*14=311*(-560)= Let me compute 300*(-560)= -168000, 11*(-560)= -6160, total= -168000 -6160= -174160.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n-784x +17416x -174160=3500.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-784 +17416)x = (17416 -784)x= 16632x.\n\nSo, 16632x -174160=3500.\n\nBring constants to the other side:\n\n16632x=3500 +174160=177660.\n\nSo, x=177660 /16632.\n\nSimplify this fraction.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 12:\n\n177660 \u00f712=14805.\n\n16632 \u00f712=1386.\n\nSo, 14805 /1386.\n\nCheck if they can be divided further.\n\nLet me see, 14805 \u00f73=4935; 1386 \u00f73=462.\n\nSo, 4935 /462.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3 again: 4935 \u00f73=1645; 462 \u00f73=154.\n\n1645 /154.\n\nCheck if they can be divided further.\n\n1645 \u00f77=235; 154 \u00f77=22.\n\nSo, 235/22.\n\nSo, x=235/22.\n\nNow, substitute x into y=4\u221a14 (x -10):\n\ny=4\u221a14 (235/22 -10)=4\u221a14 (235/22 -220/22)=4\u221a14 (15/22)= (60\u221a14)/22= (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (235/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, we need to find the equation of line AD. Since A is at (0,0) and D is at (235/22, 30\u221a14/11), the parametric equations can be written as:\n\nx= (235/22)t\n\ny= (30\u221a14/11)t\n\nwhere t ranges from 0 to 1 for segment AD, and beyond for the extended line.\n\nWe need to find where this line intersects the circumcircle \u03c9 again at point P.\n\nThe equation of the circumcircle is x^2 + y^2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y =0.\n\nSubstitute x= (235/22)t, y= (30\u221a14/11)t into the circle equation.\n\nSo, [(235/22 t)^2 + (30\u221a14/11 t)^2 ] -10*(235/22 t) - (5\u221a14/28)*(30\u221a14/11 t)=0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (235/22)^2 t^2 + (30\u221a14/11)^2 t^2.\n\nSecond term: -10*(235/22)t.\n\nThird term: - (5\u221a14/28)*(30\u221a14/11) t.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nCompute first term:\n\n(235/22)^2 = (235)^2 / (22)^2. 235^2= (200+35)^2=200^2 +2*200*35 +35^2=40000 +14000 +1225=55225.\n\n(22)^2=484.\n\nSo, (235/22)^2=55225/484.\n\n(30\u221a14/11)^2= (900*14)/121=12600/121.\n\nSo, first term is (55225/484 + 12600/121) t^2.\n\nNote that 12600/121= (12600*4)/484=50400/484.\n\nSo, total first term: (55225 +50400)/484 t^2=105625/484 t^2.\n\nSecond term: -10*(235/22)t= -2350/22 t= -1175/11 t.\n\nThird term: - (5\u221a14/28)*(30\u221a14/11) t.\n\nMultiply the constants:\n\n5*30=150.\n\n\u221a14*\u221a14=14.\n\nDenominator:28*11=308.\n\nSo, the term is - (150*14)/308 t= -2100/308 t.\n\nSimplify 2100/308: divide numerator and denominator by 28: 2100 \u00f728=75, 308 \u00f728=11.\n\nSo, 75/11.\n\nThus, the third term is -75/11 t.\n\nPutting all together:\n\n105625/484 t^2 -1175/11 t -75/11 t =0.\n\nCombine the linear terms:\n\n-1175/11 t -75/11 t = -1250/11 t.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n105625/484 t^2 -1250/11 t=0.\n\nMultiply through by 484 to eliminate denominators:\n\n105625 t^2 - (1250/11)*484 t=0.\n\nCompute (1250/11)*484:\n\n1250 *484= let me compute 1250*400=500,000; 1250*84=105,000; total=605,000.\n\nDivide by 11: 605,000 /11=55,000.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n105625 t^2 -55000 t=0.\n\nFactor t:\n\nt (105625 t -55000)=0.\n\nSo, solutions t=0 and t=55000/105625.\n\nSimplify 55000/105625.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25: 55000 \u00f725=2200; 105625 \u00f725=4225.\n\nSo, 2200/4225.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 2200 \u00f75=440; 4225 \u00f75=845.\n\nSo, 440/845.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5 again: 440 \u00f75=88; 845 \u00f75=169.\n\nSo, 88/169.\n\nCheck if 88 and 169 have common factors: 88 factors are 8*11, 169 is 13^2. So, co-prime.\n\nThus, t=88/169.\n\nTherefore, point P corresponds to t=88/169.\n\nSo, the coordinates of P are:\n\nx= (235/22)*(88/169)= (235 *88)/(22*169).\n\nSimplify 88/22=4, so x=235 *4 /169=940/169.\n\nSimilarly, y= (30\u221a14/11)*(88/169)= (30\u221a14 *88)/(11*169).\n\nSimplify 88/11=8, so y=30\u221a14 *8 /169=240\u221a14 /169.\n\nSo, point P is at (940/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nNow, we need to compute AP.\n\nPoint A is at (0,0), P is at (940/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nSo, distance AP is sqrt[(940/169)^2 + (240\u221a14/169)^2].\n\nFactor out (1/169)^2:\n\nsqrt[(940^2 + (240\u221a14)^2)/169^2] = sqrt[(940^2 + 240^2 *14)]/169.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n940^2 = (900+40)^2=900^2 + 2*900*40 +40^2=810000 +72000 +1600=883600.\n\n240^2=57600.\n\n57600*14=806400.\n\nSo, numerator inside sqrt:883600 +806400=1,690,000.\n\nSo, sqrt(1,690,000)=1300.\n\nThus, AP=1300 /169.\n\nSimplify 1300/169.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 13: 1300 \u00f713=100; 169 \u00f713=13.\n\nSo, 100/13.\n\nSo, AP=100/13.\n\nThus, m=100, n=13. They are coprime.\n\nSo, m +n=113.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that triangle \\(ABC\\) is inscribed in circle \\(\\omega\\). The tangents at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) intersect at point \\(D\\), and line \\(AD\\) intersects \\(\\omega\\) again at \\(P\\). We are given \\(AB = 5\\), \\(BC = 9\\), and \\(AC = 10\\), and we need to find \\(AP\\) in the form \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime integers, and then compute \\(m + n\\).\n\nFirst, we use coordinate geometry to place the triangle in a coordinate system. We set \\(A\\) at \\((0,0)\\) and \\(C\\) at \\((10,0)\\). Using the distance formula, we find the coordinates of \\(B\\) to be \\(\\left(\\frac{11}{5}, \\frac{6\\sqrt{14}}{5}\\right)\\).\n\nNext, we determine the equation of the circumcircle \\(\\omega\\) passing through \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\). The general equation of the circle is found to be:\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 - 10x - \\frac{5\\sqrt{14}}{28}y = 0\n\\]\n\nWe then find the equations of the tangents at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\). Solving these equations, we determine the coordinates of point \\(D\\) to be \\(\\left(\\frac{235}{22}, \\frac{30\\sqrt{14}}{11}\\right)\\).\n\nThe line \\(AD\\) is parameterized, and we substitute this parameterization into the circumcircle equation to find the intersection point \\(P\\). Solving the resulting quadratic equation, we find the parameter \\(t = \\frac{88}{169}\\), leading to the coordinates of \\(P\\) as \\(\\left(\\frac{940}{169}, \\frac{240\\sqrt{14}}{169}\\right)\\).\n\nFinally, we compute the distance \\(AP\\) using the distance formula. Simplifying, we find \\(AP = \\frac{100}{13}\\). Thus, \\(m = 100\\) and \\(n = 13\\), giving \\(m + n = 113\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{113}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. \n\nWe have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents to \u03c9 at B and C intersect at point D. Then, line AD intersects \u03c9 again at point P. We're given the sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find the length AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.\n\nHmm, okay. So first, let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. The circle \u03c9 is the circumcircle of ABC. Then, from points B and C, we draw tangents to \u03c9, which meet at point D. Then, we draw line AD, which intersects \u03c9 again at point P. We need to find AP.\n\nI think I should start by recalling some properties about tangents and circles. The tangent to a circle at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, where O is the center of \u03c9. Similarly, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC.\n\nSince D is the intersection of the two tangents, triangle DBC is formed, and D is the ex-pole or something? Wait, maybe not. Let me think. The point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole of the line BC with respect to the circle. Alternatively, D is the exsimilicenter or something? Hmm, maybe that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the power of point D with respect to \u03c9. The power of D is equal to DB\u00b2 and DC\u00b2, since DB and DC are tangent lengths from D to \u03c9. So, DB = DC because they're both tangent lengths from D. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, because the tangents from a single point to a circle are equal in length. So, DB = DC. So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.\n\nBut wait, in this case, since B and C are different points, and the tangents from D to \u03c9 meet at B and C, so yes, DB = DC.\n\nHmm. So, D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC? Or perhaps lies on the A-symmedian? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps using harmonic division or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using inversion. But maybe that's too complicated for now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinates. Let me think. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle ABC. Let me place point C at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity. Then, point A is at (10, 0), since AC is 10 units. Then, point B is somewhere in the plane. Let me compute the coordinates of B.\n\nGiven triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, coordinates:\n\nC: (0, 0)\nA: (10, 0)\nB: Let's compute its coordinates.\n\nLet me denote coordinates of B as (x, y). Then, distance from B to C is 9, so:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 81. (Equation 1)\n\nDistance from B to A is 5, so:\n\n(x - 10)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 25. (Equation 2)\n\nSubtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\n(x - 10)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 25 - 81\nExpanding (x - 10)^2: x\u00b2 - 20x + 100 + y\u00b2 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -56\nSimplify: -20x + 100 = -56\nSo, -20x = -156\nx = (-156)/(-20) = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8\n\nThen, from Equation 1, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 81.\n\nx = 39/5, so x\u00b2 = (39/5)^2 = 1521/25.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 81 - 1521/25 = (2025/25 - 1521/25) = 504/25.\n\nThus, y = sqrt(504/25) = (sqrt(504))/5.\n\nSimplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which isn't an integer. Wait, let's factor 504.\n\n504: 504 = 7 * 72 = 7 * 8 * 9 = 7 * 8 * 3^2. So, sqrt(504) = sqrt(7 * 8 * 9) = sqrt(7 * 8) * sqrt(9) = 3 * sqrt(56) = 3 * sqrt(4*14) = 3*2*sqrt(14) = 6 sqrt(14).\n\nSo, y = (6 sqrt(14))/5.\n\nSo, coordinates of B are (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). Let me note that down.\n\nSo, points:\n\nA: (10, 0)\nB: (39/5, 6\u221a14/5)\nC: (0, 0)\n\nNow, I need to find point D, the intersection of the tangents at B and C to \u03c9. Then, find line AD and its intersection P with \u03c9, then compute AP.\n\nSo, step by step.\n\nFirst, find the equation of the tangent at B to \u03c9.\n\nTo find the tangent at B, I need the equation of the circle \u03c9, which is the circumcircle of ABC. Since I have coordinates for A, B, C, I can compute the circumcircle.\n\nLet me compute the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nCircumcircle passes through A(10,0), B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5), and C(0,0).\n\nLet me find the equation of the circle passing through these three points.\n\nGeneral equation of a circle: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0.\n\nPlugging in point C (0,0):\n\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 => F = 0.\n\nSo, equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey = 0.\n\nPlugging in point A (10,0):\n\n10\u00b2 + 0 + D*10 + E*0 = 0 => 100 + 10 D = 0 => 10 D = -100 => D = -10.\n\nSo, equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey = 0.\n\nNow, plugging in point B (39/5, 6\u221a14/5):\n\n(39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5) = 0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(39/5)^2 = (1521)/(25)\n(6\u221a14/5)^2 = (36 *14)/25 = 504/25\n-10*(39/5) = -78\nE*(6\u221a14/5) remains as is.\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n1521/25 + 504/25 -78 + (6\u221a14 E)/5 = 0\n\nCompute 1521 + 504 = 2025, so 2025/25 = 81.\n\nSo, 81 -78 + (6\u221a14 E)/5 = 0 => 3 + (6\u221a14 E)/5 = 0.\n\nThus, (6\u221a14 E)/5 = -3 => E = (-3 * 5)/(6\u221a14) = (-15)/(6\u221a14) = (-5)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing denominator:\n\nE = (-5)/(2\u221a14) * (\u221a14/\u221a14) = (-5\u221a14)/28.\n\nSo, the equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + (-5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nAlternatively, I can write it as x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, I need to find the tangent at point B to this circle.\n\nThe tangent at a point (x1, y1) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0 is given by:\n\nx x1 + y y1 + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F = 0.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula. The tangent at (x1, y1) is:\n\nxx1 + yy1 + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F = 0.\n\nWait, let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, the tangent can be found using the derivative or using the fact that it's perpendicular to the radius.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to use the formula.\n\nSo, for point B (39/5, 6\u221a14/5), the tangent is:\n\nx*(39/5) + y*(6\u221a14/5) + D*(x + 39/5)/2 + E*(y + 6\u221a14/5)/2 + F = 0.\n\nBut wait, our circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0, so D = -10, E = -5\u221a14/28, F = 0.\n\nSo, substituting into the tangent formula:\n\nx*(39/5) + y*(6\u221a14/5) + (-10)*(x + 39/5)/2 + (-5\u221a14/28)*(y + 6\u221a14/5)/2 + 0 = 0.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: (39/5)x\n\nSecond term: (6\u221a14/5)y\n\nThird term: (-10)*(x + 39/5)/2 = (-10/2)(x + 39/5) = -5(x + 39/5) = -5x - 39\n\nFourth term: (-5\u221a14/28)*(y + 6\u221a14/5)/2 = (-5\u221a14/28)*(y + (6\u221a14)/5) * (1/2) = (-5\u221a14)/(56)*(y + (6\u221a14)/5)\n\nLet me compute this term:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\n= [ -5\u221a14 * y -5\u221a14*(6\u221a14)/5 ] / 56\n= [ -5\u221a14 y - (5\u221a14 * 6\u221a14)/5 ] /56\nSimplify each part:\n\nFirst part: -5\u221a14 y\n\nSecond part: (5*6)*(\u221a14 * \u221a14)/5 = (30)*(14)/5 = (420)/5 = 84\n\nSo, numerator is -5\u221a14 y -84.\n\nThus, the fourth term is (-5\u221a14 y -84)/56.\n\nSo, putting all terms together:\n\n(39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y -5x -39 + (-5\u221a14 y -84)/56 = 0.\n\nNow, let's combine like terms.\n\nFirst, collect x terms:\n\n(39/5)x -5x = (39/5 -25/5)x = (14/5)x.\n\nNext, y terms:\n\n(6\u221a14/5)y + (-5\u221a14 y)/56.\n\nTo combine these, let me find a common denominator, which is 5*56=280.\n\nSo,\n\n(6\u221a14/5)y = (6\u221a14 *56/280)y = (336\u221a14)/280 y.\n\n(-5\u221a14 y)/56 = (-5\u221a14 *5)/280 y = (-25\u221a14)/280 y.\n\nAdding these together: (336\u221a14 -25\u221a14)/280 y = (311\u221a14)/280 y.\n\nConstant terms:\n\n-39 + (-84)/56 = -39 - 84/56.\n\nSimplify 84/56 = 3/2, so total constants: -39 - 3/2 = -39.5 = -79/2.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, 84/56 is 3/2, so -39 - 3/2 = -(39 + 1.5) = -40.5, which is -81/2.\n\nWait, let's compute it correctly:\n\n-39 is equal to -78/2, so -78/2 - 3/2 = (-81)/2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the equation becomes:\n\n(14/5)x + (311\u221a14/280)y -81/2 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy. Maybe I made an error in calculation. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the fourth term. Let me go back.\n\nThe fourth term is:\n\n(-5\u221a14/28)*(y + 6\u221a14/5)/2\n\nWhich is equal to (-5\u221a14/28)*(y) + (-5\u221a14/28)*(6\u221a14/5)/2\n\nWait, let me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst part: (-5\u221a14/28)*y.\n\nSecond part: (-5\u221a14/28)*(6\u221a14/5) / 2\n\nWait, no: the term is [ (-5\u221a14/28) * (y + (6\u221a14)/5) ] * (1/2), right?\n\nSo, that's equal to [ (-5\u221a14/28)*y - (5\u221a14/28)*(6\u221a14)/5 ] * (1/2)\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst part: (-5\u221a14/28)*y * (1/2) = (-5\u221a14)/(56) y\n\nSecond part: (-5\u221a14/28)*(6\u221a14/5) * (1/2)\n\nSimplify numerator: (-5\u221a14)(6\u221a14) = (-5*6)*(\u221a14)^2 = (-30)*14 = -420\n\nDenominator: 28 *5 * 2 = 280\n\nSo, the second part is (-420)/280 = -1.5 = -3/2.\n\nWait, that's a constant term, not multiplied by y.\n\nSo, the fourth term is (-5\u221a14)/(56) y -3/2.\n\nSo, going back to the overall equation:\n\n(39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y -5x -39 + (-5\u221a14 y)/(56) -3/2 = 0.\n\nSo, x terms: (39/5 -5)x = (39/5 -25/5)x = 14/5 x.\n\ny terms: (6\u221a14/5 -5\u221a14/56) y.\n\nLet me compute the coefficients:\n\n6\u221a14/5 = (6*56\u221a14)/(5*56) = (336\u221a14)/280.\n\n5\u221a14/56 = (5\u221a14*5)/(56*5) = (25\u221a14)/280.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. To combine 6\u221a14/5 and -5\u221a14/56, find a common denominator.\n\nThe denominators are 5 and 56, so LCD is 280.\n\n6\u221a14/5 = (6\u221a14 *56)/280 = 336\u221a14/280.\n\n-5\u221a14/56 = (-5\u221a14 *5)/280 = -25\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, together: (336\u221a14 -25\u221a14)/280 = 311\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, the y term is 311\u221a14/280 y.\n\nConstants: -39 -3/2 = -(78/2 + 3/2) = -81/2.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n14/5 x + 311\u221a14/280 y -81/2 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's still a bit messy, but okay. Let me write this as:\n\n14/5 x + (311\u221a14/280) y = 81/2.\n\nAlternatively, multiply both sides by 280 to eliminate denominators.\n\n14/5 x *280 = 14 *56 x = 784 x.\n\n(311\u221a14/280) y *280 = 311\u221a14 y.\n\n81/2 *280 = 81 *140 = 11340.\n\nSo, the equation is 784x + 311\u221a14 y = 11340.\n\nHmm, okay. That's the equation of the tangent at B.\n\nNow, similarly, I need the equation of the tangent at C. Point C is (0,0).\n\nSo, let's find the tangent at C (0,0) to the circle \u03c9.\n\nUsing the same formula: for point (x1, y1) on the circle, the tangent is:\n\nx x1 + y y1 + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F = 0.\n\nHere, x1=0, y1=0, D=-10, E=-5\u221a14/28, F=0.\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\nx*0 + y*0 + (-10)*(x + 0)/2 + (-5\u221a14/28)*(y + 0)/2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n0 + 0 + (-10x)/2 + (-5\u221a14 y)/56 + 0 = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-5x - (5\u221a14 y)/56 = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 56 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-5x*56 -5\u221a14 y = 0 => -280x -5\u221a14 y = 0.\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent at C is -280x -5\u221a14 y = 0. Let me write it as 280x +5\u221a14 y = 0.\n\nNow, we have two equations of the tangents at B and C:\n\n1. 784x + 311\u221a14 y = 11340 (from tangent at B)\n2. 280x +5\u221a14 y = 0 (from tangent at C)\n\nWe need to find their intersection point D.\n\nSo, solve the system of equations:\n\nEquation 1: 784x + 311\u221a14 y = 11340\nEquation 2: 280x +5\u221a14 y = 0\n\nLet me solve equation 2 for x in terms of y.\n\nEquation 2: 280x = -5\u221a14 y => x = (-5\u221a14 y)/(280) = (-\u221a14 y)/56.\n\nNow, substitute x into equation 1.\n\nEquation 1 becomes:\n\n784*(-\u221a14 y/56) + 311\u221a14 y = 11340.\n\nSimplify 784/56: 784 \u00f756 = 14.\n\nSo, 14*(-\u221a14 y) + 311\u221a14 y = 11340.\n\nFactor out \u221a14 y:\n\n\u221a14 y (-14 + 311) = 11340.\n\nCompute inside the brackets: 311 -14 = 297.\n\nSo, \u221a14 y *297 = 11340.\n\nSolve for y:\n\ny = 11340 / (297\u221a14).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n11340 \u00f7297: Let me compute 297*38 = 11286, which is 297*38 = (300 -3)*38= 11400 -114=11286. Then, 11340 -11286=54. So, 11340=297*38 +54=297*38 +54. So, 54=297* (54/297)= 54/(297)= 6/33=2/11.\n\nWait, no, perhaps better to factor numerator and denominator.\n\n11340 and 297.\n\nFactor 11340: 11340= 100*113.4, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, 11340= 1134 *10. 1134= 1134= 2*567=2*3*189=2*3*3*63=2*3*3*3*21=2*3^4 *7.\n\nSimilarly, 297=9*33=9*3*11=3^3 *11.\n\nSo, 11340= 2*3^4 *5 *7 *2 (Wait, wait: 11340= 1134 *10= (2*3^4 *7) * (2*5))= 2^2 *3^4 *5 *7.\n\n297=3^3 *11.\n\nSo, gcd(11340,297)= 3^3=27.\n\nSo, 11340 \u00f727= 420.\n\n297 \u00f727=11.\n\nSo, y= (420)/(11\u221a14).\n\nSimplify:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\ny= (420\u221a14)/(11*14) = (420\u221a14)/(154).\n\nSimplify 420 and 154:\n\n154=14*11.\n\n420=14*30.\n\nSo, 420/154= 30/11.\n\nThus, y= (30/11)\u221a14.\n\nSo, y= (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nThen, from equation 2, x= (-\u221a14 y)/56.\n\nPlug in y:\n\nx= (-\u221a14 * (30\u221a14)/11 ) /56.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n\u221a14 *30\u221a14=30*(\u221a14)^2=30*14=420.\n\nSo, x= (-420/11)/56= (-420)/(11*56).\n\nSimplify 420 \u00f756: 56*7=392, 56*7.5=420, so 7.5=15/2.\n\nSo, x= - (15/2)/11= -15/(22).\n\nSo, point D has coordinates (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nHmm, okay. So, D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, we need to find line AD and find its intersection P with \u03c9 (other than A).\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nSo, let's find the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nParametric equations:\n\nx = 10 + t*( (-15/22) -10 ) = 10 + t*(-235/22)\n\ny = 0 + t*(30\u221a14/11 -0 )= t*(30\u221a14/11 )\n\nWhere t is a parameter.\n\nWe need to find the point P where this line intersects \u03c9 again. Since A is already on \u03c9, the other intersection is P.\n\nSo, substitute x and y into the circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n[10 - (235/22) t]^2 + [ (30\u221a14/11) t ]^2 -10[10 - (235/22) t ] - (5\u221a14/28)(30\u221a14/11) t = 0.\n\nThis looks complicated, but let's expand it step by step.\n\nFirst, expand [10 - (235/22) t]^2:\n\n= 100 - 2*10*(235/22) t + (235/22)^2 t^2\n= 100 - (4700/22) t + (55225/484) t^2\nSimplify 4700/22: 4700 \u00f72=2350, 22 \u00f72=11. So, 2350/11.\n\nSo, 100 - (2350/11) t + (55225/484) t^2.\n\nNext, expand [ (30\u221a14/11) t ]^2:\n\n= (900*14)/121 t^2\n= 12600/121 t^2.\n\nNow, the third term: -10[10 - (235/22) t ] = -100 + (2350/22) t.\n\nThe fourth term: - (5\u221a14/28)(30\u221a14/11) t.\n\nCompute this:\n\nMultiply the constants:\n\n5*30=150, \u221a14*\u221a14=14, 28*11=308.\n\nSo, term is - (150*14)/(308) t = - (2100)/308 t.\n\nSimplify 2100/308: both divided by 28: 2100 \u00f728=75, 308 \u00f728=11.\n\nSo, 75/11.\n\nThus, term is -75/11 t.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nFirst part: 100 - (2350/11) t + (55225/484) t^2 + 12600/121 t^2 -100 + (2350/22) t -75/11 t = 0.\n\nSimplify term by term.\n\n1. Constants: 100 -100 = 0.\n\n2. Terms with t:\n\n-2350/11 t + 2350/22 t -75/11 t.\n\nLet me convert all to 22 denominator:\n\n-2350/11 t = -4700/22 t.\n\n2350/22 t remains as is.\n\n-75/11 t = -150/22 t.\n\nSo, total t terms:\n\n(-4700 +2350 -150)/22 t = (-2500)/22 t = -1250/11 t.\n\n3. Terms with t\u00b2:\n\n55225/484 t\u00b2 + 12600/121 t\u00b2.\n\nConvert to common denominator 484:\n\n55225/484 t\u00b2 + (12600 *4)/484 t\u00b2 = 55225/484 + 50400/484 = (55225 +50400)/484 t\u00b2 = 105625/484 t\u00b2.\n\nSo, combining all:\n\n105625/484 t\u00b2 -1250/11 t = 0.\n\nFactor out t:\n\nt (105625/484 t -1250/11 ) = 0.\n\nSolutions: t=0, which corresponds to point A, and the other solution:\n\n105625/484 t -1250/11 =0 => t= (1250/11) * (484/105625).\n\nSimplify:\n\nCompute 1250 *484 = ?\n\nLet me compute 1250 *484:\n\n1250 *400=500,000\n\n1250*84=105,000\n\nTotal: 500,000 +105,000=605,000.\n\nSo, t= (605,000)/(11 *105625).\n\nSimplify denominator: 11*105625= 1,161,875.\n\nSo, t= 605,000 /1,161,875.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by dividing by 25:\n\n605,000 \u00f725=24,200\n\n1,161,875 \u00f725=46,475.\n\nSo, t=24,200 /46,475.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n24,200 \u00f75=4,840\n\n46,475 \u00f75=9,295.\n\nCheck if 4,840 and 9,295 have a common factor.\n\n4,840: factors include 5, 10, etc.\n\n9,295: ends with 5, so divide by 5: 9,295 \u00f75=1,859.\n\n4,840 \u00f75=968.\n\nSo, t=968/1,859.\n\nCheck if 968 and 1859 have any common factors.\n\nCompute GCD(968, 1859).\n\nCompute 1859 \u00f7968=1 with remainder 891.\n\n968 \u00f7891=1, remainder 77.\n\n891 \u00f777=11, remainder 44.\n\n77 \u00f744=1, remainder 33.\n\n44 \u00f733=1, remainder11.\n\n33 \u00f711=3, remainder 0.\n\nSo, GCD is 11.\n\nSo, 968 \u00f711=88, 1859 \u00f711=169.\n\nSo, t=88/169.\n\nThus, t=88/169.\n\nSo, point P corresponds to t=88/169.\n\nNow, let's find the coordinates of P.\n\nx=10 + t*(-235/22)=10 - (235/22)*(88/169).\n\nCompute 235/22 *88/169.\n\n235 *88 = let's compute 235*80=18,800; 235*8=1,880. So, total 18,800+1,880=20,680.\n\n22*169= 3,718.\n\nSo, x=10 - (20,680 /3,718).\n\nSimplify 20,680 \u00f73,718: let's see, 3,718*5=18,590; 20,680-18,590=2,090.\n\n3,718*0.56= approx 2,080. So, 5.56.\n\nWait, exact division:\n\n20,680 \u00f73,718: let's see, both divided by 2: 10,340 /1,859.\n\n1,859*5=9,295. 10,340-9,295=1,045.\n\n1,859*0.56\u22481,040. So, approximately 5.56.\n\nBut perhaps we can simplify 10,340 /1,859.\n\nWait, 1,859*5=9,295, as before. 10,340-9,295=1,045.\n\n1,045 \u00f71,859= same as 1,045/1,859. Let me see if they have common factors.\n\n1,045=5*209=5*11*19.\n\n1,859: Let's check if 11 divides into it. 1+5=6, 8+9=17. 6-17=-11, which is divisible by 11. So, 1,859 \u00f711=169.\n\nSo, 1,859=11*169.\n\n1,045=5*11*19.\n\nSo, 1,045/1,859= (5*11*19)/(11*169)= (5*19)/169=95/169.\n\nThus, 10,340 /1,859=5 +95/169=5 95/169.\n\nSo, x=10 -5 95/169=4 + (169/169 -95/169)=4 +74/169=4 74/169.\n\nAs an improper fraction: 4*169 +74=676 +74=750. So, 750/169.\n\nSimilarly, compute y:\n\ny= t*(30\u221a14/11)= (88/169)*(30\u221a14/11).\n\nSimplify:\n\n88 \u00f711=8, so:\n\ny=8*30\u221a14 /169=240\u221a14 /169.\n\nSo, coordinates of P are (750/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nNow, we need to find the distance AP.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), point P is at (750/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nCompute the distance between them.\n\nAP=\u221a[(10 -750/169)^2 + (0 -240\u221a14/169)^2].\n\nCompute 10 -750/169= (1690 -750)/169=940/169.\n\nSo, AP=\u221a[(940/169)^2 + (240\u221a14/169)^2].\n\nFactor out 1/169^2:\n\nAP= (1/169)\u221a[940^2 + (240\u221a14)^2].\n\nCompute inside the square root:\n\n940^2 = (900 +40)^2=900^2 +2*900*40 +40^2=810,000 +72,000 +1,600=883,600.\n\n(240\u221a14)^2=240^2 *14=57,600 *14=806,400.\n\nSo, total inside sqrt:883,600 +806,400=1,690,000.\n\nSo, AP= (1/169)\u221a1,690,000.\n\nCompute sqrt(1,690,000). 1,690,000=1,690 *1000=169*10*1000=169*10,000.\n\nSo, sqrt(169*10,000)=13*100=1,300.\n\nThus, AP=1,300 /169.\n\nSimplify 1,300 \u00f7169. Let's see, 169*7=1,183, 169*8=1,352. So, 1,300 \u00f7169=7.69... Wait, wait, but 169*7=1,183, 1,300-1,183=117.\n\n117 \u00f7169=117/169=9*13/(13*13)=9/13.\n\nSo, 1,300=169*7 +117=169*7 +9*13.\n\nBut wait, 1,300=169*7 + 117=169*7 +9*13=13*(13*7 +9)=13*(91 +9)=13*100=1,300. Wait, that's circular.\n\nAlternatively, 1,300=169*7.692... Hmm, but perhaps better to see 1,300/169.\n\nCompute 169*7=1,183.\n\n1,300-1,183=117.\n\nSo, 1,300/169=7 +117/169.\n\nSimplify 117/169: both divided by 13: 117 \u00f713=9, 169 \u00f713=13.\n\nSo, 117/169=9/13.\n\nThus, 1,300/169=7 +9/13=7 9/13= (7*13 +9)/13= (91 +9)/13=100/13.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait, 7*13=91, 91+9=100. So, 100/13.\n\nWait, but 7 9/13 is 100/13, because 7*13=91, 91+9=100. So, 100/13.\n\nBut wait, 100/13 is approximately 7.69, which is consistent with earlier.\n\nSo, AP=100/13.\n\nWait, so AP=100/13, which is in reduced terms since 100 and 13 are coprime.\n\nThus, m=100, n=13. m +n=113.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, when I computed AP, I had:\n\nAP= (1/169)*\u221a(940^2 + (240\u221a14)^2 )= (1/169)*\u221a(883600 +806400)= (1/169)*\u221a1,690,000= (1/169)*1,300=1,300/169=100/13.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, AP=100/13, so m +n=100+13=113.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe length of \\( AP \\) is found to be \\( \\frac{100}{13} \\). Therefore, \\( m = 100 \\) and \\( n = 13 \\), and \\( m + n = 113 \\).\n\n\\boxed{113}",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. \n\nWe have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents to \u03c9 at B and C intersect at point D. Then, line AD intersects \u03c9 again at point P. We're given the sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find the length AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.\n\nHmm, okay. So first, let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. The circle \u03c9 is the circumcircle of ABC. Then, from points B and C, we draw tangents to \u03c9, which meet at point D. Then, we draw line AD, which intersects \u03c9 again at point P. We need to find AP.\n\nI think I should start by recalling some properties about tangents and circles. The tangent to a circle at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, where O is the center of \u03c9. Similarly, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC.\n\nSince D is the intersection of the two tangents, triangle DBC is formed, and D is the ex-pole or something? Wait, maybe not. Let me think. The point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole of the line BC with respect to the circle. Alternatively, D is the exsimilicenter or something? Hmm, maybe that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the power of point D with respect to \u03c9. The power of D is equal to DB\u00b2 and DC\u00b2, since DB and DC are tangent lengths from D to \u03c9. So, DB = DC because they're both tangent lengths from D. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, because the tangents from a single point to a circle are equal in length. So, DB = DC. So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.\n\nBut wait, in this case, since B and C are different points, and the tangents from D to \u03c9 meet at B and C, so yes, DB = DC.\n\nHmm. So, D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC? Or perhaps lies on the A-symmedian? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps using harmonic division or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using inversion. But maybe that's too complicated for now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinates. Let me think. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle ABC. Let me place point C at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity. Then, point A is at (10, 0), since AC is 10 units. Then, point B is somewhere in the plane. Let me compute the coordinates of B.\n\nGiven triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, coordinates:\n\nC: (0, 0)\nA: (10, 0)\nB: Let's compute its coordinates.\n\nLet me denote coordinates of B as (x, y). Then, distance from B to C is 9, so:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 81. (Equation 1)\n\nDistance from B to A is 5, so:\n\n(x - 10)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 25. (Equation 2)\n\nSubtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\n(x - 10)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 25 - 81\nExpanding (x - 10)^2: x\u00b2 - 20x + 100 + y\u00b2 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -56\nSimplify: -20x + 100 = -56\nSo, -20x = -156\nx = (-156)/(-20) = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8\n\nThen, from Equation 1, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 81.\n\nx = 39/5, so x\u00b2 = (39/5)^2 = 1521/25.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 81 - 1521/25 = (2025/25 - 1521/25) = 504/25.\n\nThus, y = sqrt(504/25) = (sqrt(504))/5.\n\nSimplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which isn't an integer. Wait, let's factor 504.\n\n504: 504 = 7 * 72 = 7 * 8 * 9 = 7 * 8 * 3^2. So, sqrt(504) = sqrt(7 * 8 * 9) = sqrt(7 * 8) * sqrt(9) = 3 * sqrt(56) = 3 * sqrt(4*14) = 3*2*sqrt(14) = 6 sqrt(14).\n\nSo, y = (6 sqrt(14))/5.\n\nSo, coordinates of B are (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). Let me note that down.\n\nSo, points:\n\nA: (10, 0)\nB: (39/5, 6\u221a14/5)\nC: (0, 0)\n\nNow, I need to find point D, the intersection of the tangents at B and C to \u03c9. Then, find line AD and its intersection P with \u03c9, then compute AP.\n\nSo, step by step.\n\nFirst, find the equation of the tangent at B to \u03c9.\n\nTo find the tangent at B, I need the equation of the circle \u03c9, which is the circumcircle of ABC. Since I have coordinates for A, B, C, I can compute the circumcircle.\n\nLet me compute the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nCircumcircle passes through A(10,0), B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5), and C(0,0).\n\nLet me find the equation of the circle passing through these three points.\n\nGeneral equation of a circle: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0.\n\nPlugging in point C (0,0):\n\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 => F = 0.\n\nSo, equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey = 0.\n\nPlugging in point A (10,0):\n\n10\u00b2 + 0 + D*10 + E*0 = 0 => 100 + 10 D = 0 => 10 D = -100 => D = -10.\n\nSo, equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey = 0.\n\nNow, plugging in point B (39/5, 6\u221a14/5):\n\n(39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5) = 0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(39/5)^2 = (1521)/(25)\n(6\u221a14/5)^2 = (36 *14)/25 = 504/25\n-10*(39/5) = -78\nE*(6\u221a14/5) remains as is.\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n1521/25 + 504/25 -78 + (6\u221a14 E)/5 = 0\n\nCompute 1521 + 504 = 2025, so 2025/25 = 81.\n\nSo, 81 -78 + (6\u221a14 E)/5 = 0 => 3 + (6\u221a14 E)/5 = 0.\n\nThus, (6\u221a14 E)/5 = -3 => E = (-3 * 5)/(6\u221a14) = (-15)/(6\u221a14) = (-5)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing denominator:\n\nE = (-5)/(2\u221a14) * (\u221a14/\u221a14) = (-5\u221a14)/28.\n\nSo, the equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + (-5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nAlternatively, I can write it as x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, I need to find the tangent at point B to this circle.\n\nThe tangent at a point (x1, y1) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0 is given by:\n\nx x1 + y y1 + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F = 0.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula. The tangent at (x1, y1) is:\n\nxx1 + yy1 + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F = 0.\n\nWait, let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, the tangent can be found using the derivative or using the fact that it's perpendicular to the radius.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to use the formula.\n\nSo, for point B (39/5, 6\u221a14/5), the tangent is:\n\nx*(39/5) + y*(6\u221a14/5) + D*(x + 39/5)/2 + E*(y + 6\u221a14/5)/2 + F = 0.\n\nBut wait, our circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0, so D = -10, E = -5\u221a14/28, F = 0.\n\nSo, substituting into the tangent formula:\n\nx*(39/5) + y*(6\u221a14/5) + (-10)*(x + 39/5)/2 + (-5\u221a14/28)*(y + 6\u221a14/5)/2 + 0 = 0.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: (39/5)x\n\nSecond term: (6\u221a14/5)y\n\nThird term: (-10)*(x + 39/5)/2 = (-10/2)(x + 39/5) = -5(x + 39/5) = -5x - 39\n\nFourth term: (-5\u221a14/28)*(y + 6\u221a14/5)/2 = (-5\u221a14/28)*(y + (6\u221a14)/5) * (1/2) = (-5\u221a14)/(56)*(y + (6\u221a14)/5)\n\nLet me compute this term:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\n= [ -5\u221a14 * y -5\u221a14*(6\u221a14)/5 ] / 56\n= [ -5\u221a14 y - (5\u221a14 * 6\u221a14)/5 ] /56\nSimplify each part:\n\nFirst part: -5\u221a14 y\n\nSecond part: (5*6)*(\u221a14 * \u221a14)/5 = (30)*(14)/5 = (420)/5 = 84\n\nSo, numerator is -5\u221a14 y -84.\n\nThus, the fourth term is (-5\u221a14 y -84)/56.\n\nSo, putting all terms together:\n\n(39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y -5x -39 + (-5\u221a14 y -84)/56 = 0.\n\nNow, let's combine like terms.\n\nFirst, collect x terms:\n\n(39/5)x -5x = (39/5 -25/5)x = (14/5)x.\n\nNext, y terms:\n\n(6\u221a14/5)y + (-5\u221a14 y)/56.\n\nTo combine these, let me find a common denominator, which is 5*56=280.\n\nSo,\n\n(6\u221a14/5)y = (6\u221a14 *56/280)y = (336\u221a14)/280 y.\n\n(-5\u221a14 y)/56 = (-5\u221a14 *5)/280 y = (-25\u221a14)/280 y.\n\nAdding these together: (336\u221a14 -25\u221a14)/280 y = (311\u221a14)/280 y.\n\nConstant terms:\n\n-39 + (-84)/56 = -39 - 84/56.\n\nSimplify 84/56 = 3/2, so total constants: -39 - 3/2 = -39.5 = -79/2.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, 84/56 is 3/2, so -39 - 3/2 = -(39 + 1.5) = -40.5, which is -81/2.\n\nWait, let's compute it correctly:\n\n-39 is equal to -78/2, so -78/2 - 3/2 = (-81)/2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the equation becomes:\n\n(14/5)x + (311\u221a14/280)y -81/2 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy. Maybe I made an error in calculation. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the fourth term. Let me go back.\n\nThe fourth term is:\n\n(-5\u221a14/28)*(y + 6\u221a14/5)/2\n\nWhich is equal to (-5\u221a14/28)*(y) + (-5\u221a14/28)*(6\u221a14/5)/2\n\nWait, let me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst part: (-5\u221a14/28)*y.\n\nSecond part: (-5\u221a14/28)*(6\u221a14/5) / 2\n\nWait, no: the term is [ (-5\u221a14/28) * (y + (6\u221a14)/5) ] * (1/2), right?\n\nSo, that's equal to [ (-5\u221a14/28)*y - (5\u221a14/28)*(6\u221a14)/5 ] * (1/2)\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst part: (-5\u221a14/28)*y * (1/2) = (-5\u221a14)/(56) y\n\nSecond part: (-5\u221a14/28)*(6\u221a14/5) * (1/2)\n\nSimplify numerator: (-5\u221a14)(6\u221a14) = (-5*6)*(\u221a14)^2 = (-30)*14 = -420\n\nDenominator: 28 *5 * 2 = 280\n\nSo, the second part is (-420)/280 = -1.5 = -3/2.\n\nWait, that's a constant term, not multiplied by y.\n\nSo, the fourth term is (-5\u221a14)/(56) y -3/2.\n\nSo, going back to the overall equation:\n\n(39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y -5x -39 + (-5\u221a14 y)/(56) -3/2 = 0.\n\nSo, x terms: (39/5 -5)x = (39/5 -25/5)x = 14/5 x.\n\ny terms: (6\u221a14/5 -5\u221a14/56) y.\n\nLet me compute the coefficients:\n\n6\u221a14/5 = (6*56\u221a14)/(5*56) = (336\u221a14)/280.\n\n5\u221a14/56 = (5\u221a14*5)/(56*5) = (25\u221a14)/280.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. To combine 6\u221a14/5 and -5\u221a14/56, find a common denominator.\n\nThe denominators are 5 and 56, so LCD is 280.\n\n6\u221a14/5 = (6\u221a14 *56)/280 = 336\u221a14/280.\n\n-5\u221a14/56 = (-5\u221a14 *5)/280 = -25\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, together: (336\u221a14 -25\u221a14)/280 = 311\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, the y term is 311\u221a14/280 y.\n\nConstants: -39 -3/2 = -(78/2 + 3/2) = -81/2.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n14/5 x + 311\u221a14/280 y -81/2 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's still a bit messy, but okay. Let me write this as:\n\n14/5 x + (311\u221a14/280) y = 81/2.\n\nAlternatively, multiply both sides by 280 to eliminate denominators.\n\n14/5 x *280 = 14 *56 x = 784 x.\n\n(311\u221a14/280) y *280 = 311\u221a14 y.\n\n81/2 *280 = 81 *140 = 11340.\n\nSo, the equation is 784x + 311\u221a14 y = 11340.\n\nHmm, okay. That's the equation of the tangent at B.\n\nNow, similarly, I need the equation of the tangent at C. Point C is (0,0).\n\nSo, let's find the tangent at C (0,0) to the circle \u03c9.\n\nUsing the same formula: for point (x1, y1) on the circle, the tangent is:\n\nx x1 + y y1 + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F = 0.\n\nHere, x1=0, y1=0, D=-10, E=-5\u221a14/28, F=0.\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\nx*0 + y*0 + (-10)*(x + 0)/2 + (-5\u221a14/28)*(y + 0)/2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n0 + 0 + (-10x)/2 + (-5\u221a14 y)/56 + 0 = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-5x - (5\u221a14 y)/56 = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 56 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-5x*56 -5\u221a14 y = 0 => -280x -5\u221a14 y = 0.\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent at C is -280x -5\u221a14 y = 0. Let me write it as 280x +5\u221a14 y = 0.\n\nNow, we have two equations of the tangents at B and C:\n\n1. 784x + 311\u221a14 y = 11340 (from tangent at B)\n2. 280x +5\u221a14 y = 0 (from tangent at C)\n\nWe need to find their intersection point D.\n\nSo, solve the system of equations:\n\nEquation 1: 784x + 311\u221a14 y = 11340\nEquation 2: 280x +5\u221a14 y = 0\n\nLet me solve equation 2 for x in terms of y.\n\nEquation 2: 280x = -5\u221a14 y => x = (-5\u221a14 y)/(280) = (-\u221a14 y)/56.\n\nNow, substitute x into equation 1.\n\nEquation 1 becomes:\n\n784*(-\u221a14 y/56) + 311\u221a14 y = 11340.\n\nSimplify 784/56: 784 \u00f756 = 14.\n\nSo, 14*(-\u221a14 y) + 311\u221a14 y = 11340.\n\nFactor out \u221a14 y:\n\n\u221a14 y (-14 + 311) = 11340.\n\nCompute inside the brackets: 311 -14 = 297.\n\nSo, \u221a14 y *297 = 11340.\n\nSolve for y:\n\ny = 11340 / (297\u221a14).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n11340 \u00f7297: Let me compute 297*38 = 11286, which is 297*38 = (300 -3)*38= 11400 -114=11286. Then, 11340 -11286=54. So, 11340=297*38 +54=297*38 +54. So, 54=297* (54/297)= 54/(297)= 6/33=2/11.\n\nWait, no, perhaps better to factor numerator and denominator.\n\n11340 and 297.\n\nFactor 11340: 11340= 100*113.4, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, 11340= 1134 *10. 1134= 1134= 2*567=2*3*189=2*3*3*63=2*3*3*3*21=2*3^4 *7.\n\nSimilarly, 297=9*33=9*3*11=3^3 *11.\n\nSo, 11340= 2*3^4 *5 *7 *2 (Wait, wait: 11340= 1134 *10= (2*3^4 *7) * (2*5))= 2^2 *3^4 *5 *7.\n\n297=3^3 *11.\n\nSo, gcd(11340,297)= 3^3=27.\n\nSo, 11340 \u00f727= 420.\n\n297 \u00f727=11.\n\nSo, y= (420)/(11\u221a14).\n\nSimplify:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\ny= (420\u221a14)/(11*14) = (420\u221a14)/(154).\n\nSimplify 420 and 154:\n\n154=14*11.\n\n420=14*30.\n\nSo, 420/154= 30/11.\n\nThus, y= (30/11)\u221a14.\n\nSo, y= (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nThen, from equation 2, x= (-\u221a14 y)/56.\n\nPlug in y:\n\nx= (-\u221a14 * (30\u221a14)/11 ) /56.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n\u221a14 *30\u221a14=30*(\u221a14)^2=30*14=420.\n\nSo, x= (-420/11)/56= (-420)/(11*56).\n\nSimplify 420 \u00f756: 56*7=392, 56*7.5=420, so 7.5=15/2.\n\nSo, x= - (15/2)/11= -15/(22).\n\nSo, point D has coordinates (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nHmm, okay. So, D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, we need to find line AD and find its intersection P with \u03c9 (other than A).\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nSo, let's find the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nParametric equations:\n\nx = 10 + t*( (-15/22) -10 ) = 10 + t*(-235/22)\n\ny = 0 + t*(30\u221a14/11 -0 )= t*(30\u221a14/11 )\n\nWhere t is a parameter.\n\nWe need to find the point P where this line intersects \u03c9 again. Since A is already on \u03c9, the other intersection is P.\n\nSo, substitute x and y into the circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n[10 - (235/22) t]^2 + [ (30\u221a14/11) t ]^2 -10[10 - (235/22) t ] - (5\u221a14/28)(30\u221a14/11) t = 0.\n\nThis looks complicated, but let's expand it step by step.\n\nFirst, expand [10 - (235/22) t]^2:\n\n= 100 - 2*10*(235/22) t + (235/22)^2 t^2\n= 100 - (4700/22) t + (55225/484) t^2\nSimplify 4700/22: 4700 \u00f72=2350, 22 \u00f72=11. So, 2350/11.\n\nSo, 100 - (2350/11) t + (55225/484) t^2.\n\nNext, expand [ (30\u221a14/11) t ]^2:\n\n= (900*14)/121 t^2\n= 12600/121 t^2.\n\nNow, the third term: -10[10 - (235/22) t ] = -100 + (2350/22) t.\n\nThe fourth term: - (5\u221a14/28)(30\u221a14/11) t.\n\nCompute this:\n\nMultiply the constants:\n\n5*30=150, \u221a14*\u221a14=14, 28*11=308.\n\nSo, term is - (150*14)/(308) t = - (2100)/308 t.\n\nSimplify 2100/308: both divided by 28: 2100 \u00f728=75, 308 \u00f728=11.\n\nSo, 75/11.\n\nThus, term is -75/11 t.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nFirst part: 100 - (2350/11) t + (55225/484) t^2 + 12600/121 t^2 -100 + (2350/22) t -75/11 t = 0.\n\nSimplify term by term.\n\n1. Constants: 100 -100 = 0.\n\n2. Terms with t:\n\n-2350/11 t + 2350/22 t -75/11 t.\n\nLet me convert all to 22 denominator:\n\n-2350/11 t = -4700/22 t.\n\n2350/22 t remains as is.\n\n-75/11 t = -150/22 t.\n\nSo, total t terms:\n\n(-4700 +2350 -150)/22 t = (-2500)/22 t = -1250/11 t.\n\n3. Terms with t\u00b2:\n\n55225/484 t\u00b2 + 12600/121 t\u00b2.\n\nConvert to common denominator 484:\n\n55225/484 t\u00b2 + (12600 *4)/484 t\u00b2 = 55225/484 + 50400/484 = (55225 +50400)/484 t\u00b2 = 105625/484 t\u00b2.\n\nSo, combining all:\n\n105625/484 t\u00b2 -1250/11 t = 0.\n\nFactor out t:\n\nt (105625/484 t -1250/11 ) = 0.\n\nSolutions: t=0, which corresponds to point A, and the other solution:\n\n105625/484 t -1250/11 =0 => t= (1250/11) * (484/105625).\n\nSimplify:\n\nCompute 1250 *484 = ?\n\nLet me compute 1250 *484:\n\n1250 *400=500,000\n\n1250*84=105,000\n\nTotal: 500,000 +105,000=605,000.\n\nSo, t= (605,000)/(11 *105625).\n\nSimplify denominator: 11*105625= 1,161,875.\n\nSo, t= 605,000 /1,161,875.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by dividing by 25:\n\n605,000 \u00f725=24,200\n\n1,161,875 \u00f725=46,475.\n\nSo, t=24,200 /46,475.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n24,200 \u00f75=4,840\n\n46,475 \u00f75=9,295.\n\nCheck if 4,840 and 9,295 have a common factor.\n\n4,840: factors include 5, 10, etc.\n\n9,295: ends with 5, so divide by 5: 9,295 \u00f75=1,859.\n\n4,840 \u00f75=968.\n\nSo, t=968/1,859.\n\nCheck if 968 and 1859 have any common factors.\n\nCompute GCD(968, 1859).\n\nCompute 1859 \u00f7968=1 with remainder 891.\n\n968 \u00f7891=1, remainder 77.\n\n891 \u00f777=11, remainder 44.\n\n77 \u00f744=1, remainder 33.\n\n44 \u00f733=1, remainder11.\n\n33 \u00f711=3, remainder 0.\n\nSo, GCD is 11.\n\nSo, 968 \u00f711=88, 1859 \u00f711=169.\n\nSo, t=88/169.\n\nThus, t=88/169.\n\nSo, point P corresponds to t=88/169.\n\nNow, let's find the coordinates of P.\n\nx=10 + t*(-235/22)=10 - (235/22)*(88/169).\n\nCompute 235/22 *88/169.\n\n235 *88 = let's compute 235*80=18,800; 235*8=1,880. So, total 18,800+1,880=20,680.\n\n22*169= 3,718.\n\nSo, x=10 - (20,680 /3,718).\n\nSimplify 20,680 \u00f73,718: let's see, 3,718*5=18,590; 20,680-18,590=2,090.\n\n3,718*0.56= approx 2,080. So, 5.56.\n\nWait, exact division:\n\n20,680 \u00f73,718: let's see, both divided by 2: 10,340 /1,859.\n\n1,859*5=9,295. 10,340-9,295=1,045.\n\n1,859*0.56\u22481,040. So, approximately 5.56.\n\nBut perhaps we can simplify 10,340 /1,859.\n\nWait, 1,859*5=9,295, as before. 10,340-9,295=1,045.\n\n1,045 \u00f71,859= same as 1,045/1,859. Let me see if they have common factors.\n\n1,045=5*209=5*11*19.\n\n1,859: Let's check if 11 divides into it. 1+5=6, 8+9=17. 6-17=-11, which is divisible by 11. So, 1,859 \u00f711=169.\n\nSo, 1,859=11*169.\n\n1,045=5*11*19.\n\nSo, 1,045/1,859= (5*11*19)/(11*169)= (5*19)/169=95/169.\n\nThus, 10,340 /1,859=5 +95/169=5 95/169.\n\nSo, x=10 -5 95/169=4 + (169/169 -95/169)=4 +74/169=4 74/169.\n\nAs an improper fraction: 4*169 +74=676 +74=750. So, 750/169.\n\nSimilarly, compute y:\n\ny= t*(30\u221a14/11)= (88/169)*(30\u221a14/11).\n\nSimplify:\n\n88 \u00f711=8, so:\n\ny=8*30\u221a14 /169=240\u221a14 /169.\n\nSo, coordinates of P are (750/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nNow, we need to find the distance AP.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), point P is at (750/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nCompute the distance between them.\n\nAP=\u221a[(10 -750/169)^2 + (0 -240\u221a14/169)^2].\n\nCompute 10 -750/169= (1690 -750)/169=940/169.\n\nSo, AP=\u221a[(940/169)^2 + (240\u221a14/169)^2].\n\nFactor out 1/169^2:\n\nAP= (1/169)\u221a[940^2 + (240\u221a14)^2].\n\nCompute inside the square root:\n\n940^2 = (900 +40)^2=900^2 +2*900*40 +40^2=810,000 +72,000 +1,600=883,600.\n\n(240\u221a14)^2=240^2 *14=57,600 *14=806,400.\n\nSo, total inside sqrt:883,600 +806,400=1,690,000.\n\nSo, AP= (1/169)\u221a1,690,000.\n\nCompute sqrt(1,690,000). 1,690,000=1,690 *1000=169*10*1000=169*10,000.\n\nSo, sqrt(169*10,000)=13*100=1,300.\n\nThus, AP=1,300 /169.\n\nSimplify 1,300 \u00f7169. Let's see, 169*7=1,183, 169*8=1,352. So, 1,300 \u00f7169=7.69... Wait, wait, but 169*7=1,183, 1,300-1,183=117.\n\n117 \u00f7169=117/169=9*13/(13*13)=9/13.\n\nSo, 1,300=169*7 +117=169*7 +9*13.\n\nBut wait, 1,300=169*7 + 117=169*7 +9*13=13*(13*7 +9)=13*(91 +9)=13*100=1,300. Wait, that's circular.\n\nAlternatively, 1,300=169*7.692... Hmm, but perhaps better to see 1,300/169.\n\nCompute 169*7=1,183.\n\n1,300-1,183=117.\n\nSo, 1,300/169=7 +117/169.\n\nSimplify 117/169: both divided by 13: 117 \u00f713=9, 169 \u00f713=13.\n\nSo, 117/169=9/13.\n\nThus, 1,300/169=7 +9/13=7 9/13= (7*13 +9)/13= (91 +9)/13=100/13.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait, 7*13=91, 91+9=100. So, 100/13.\n\nWait, but 7 9/13 is 100/13, because 7*13=91, 91+9=100. So, 100/13.\n\nBut wait, 100/13 is approximately 7.69, which is consistent with earlier.\n\nSo, AP=100/13.\n\nWait, so AP=100/13, which is in reduced terms since 100 and 13 are coprime.\n\nThus, m=100, n=13. m +n=113.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, when I computed AP, I had:\n\nAP= (1/169)*\u221a(940^2 + (240\u221a14)^2 )= (1/169)*\u221a(883600 +806400)= (1/169)*\u221a1,690,000= (1/169)*1,300=1,300/169=100/13.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, AP=100/13, so m +n=100+13=113.\n\n\nThe length of \\( AP \\) is found to be \\( \\frac{100}{13} \\). Therefore, \\( m = 100 \\) and \\( n = 13 \\), and \\( m + n = 113 \\).\n\n\\boxed{113}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem where we have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents to \u03c9 at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects \u03c9 again at point P. We're given the lengths AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find AP expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime integers, and then compute m + n.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, let me visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle \u03c9 is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, line AD intersects \u03c9 again at P, and we need to find AP.\n\nHmm, tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. So, DB and DC should be equal because they're both tangents from D to \u03c9. That might come in handy.\n\nI remember that when dealing with tangents to a circle, there are some properties we can use. For instance, the power of a point. The power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2, since DB and DC are tangents. Also, since AD intersects \u03c9 at P, by the power of point A with respect to \u03c9, we have AP * AD = AB * AC, but wait, is that correct? Wait, no. The power of point A with respect to \u03c9 is zero because A lies on \u03c9. So, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider using power of point D. Since D is outside the circle, its power is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DP * DA. Because AD is a secant from D passing through P. So, Power of D: DB\u00b2 = DP * DA.\n\nSo, if I can find DB, then I can relate DP and DA. Let me note that down.\n\nSo, DB\u00b2 = DP * DA.\n\nWe need to find AP. Let's denote AP as x. Then, since P is on AD, AP = x, and PD = AD - AP = AD - x.\n\nWait, but in the power of a point formula, it's DP * DA. Hmm, let me clarify. The power of D is equal to DB\u00b2 = DP * DA. But in this case, AD passes through P, so the power is DB\u00b2 = DP * DA. But DP is the length from D to P, which is equal to DA - AP. Wait, no. Wait, AD is from A to D, passing through P. So, starting from D, moving towards A, the first intersection with the circle is P, then A is outside the circle? Wait, no, A is on the circle, because ABC is inscribed in \u03c9. So, A is on \u03c9, so AD starts at A (on \u03c9), goes through P (another point on \u03c9), and then to D (outside \u03c9). So, the order is A --- P --- D. Therefore, DA is the entire length from D to A, and DP is the part from D to P, which is DA - AP. Wait, no: DA is the distance from D to A, and AP is from A to P, so DP is DA - AP? Hmm, let's think again.\n\nWait, if you have a point D outside the circle, and a secant D-P-A, meaning P is between D and A, then the power of point D is DP * DA. But since P is between D and A, and A is on the circle, then DA is the entire length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So, DP * DA would actually be DP * (DP + PA). Wait, no, DA is DP + PA. So, Power of D is DP * (DP + PA) = DB\u00b2.\n\nSo, if I let AP = x, then DA = DP + PA, but I don't know DP yet. Alternatively, let me denote AD as t, so that AP is x, and PD is t - x. Then, according to the power of point D, DB\u00b2 = DP * DA = (t - x) * t.\n\nSo, DB\u00b2 = t(t - x). But I don't know DB or t (which is AD). Hmm, so perhaps I need another equation to relate these variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can compute DB using triangle properties. Let me think about triangle ABC. Since ABC has sides 5,9,10, perhaps we can compute some angles or other lengths.\n\nWait, perhaps we can use Stewart's theorem or the Law of Cosines to find the circumradius or other lengths.\n\nWait, another approach is to use coordinate geometry. Maybe placing triangle ABC in a coordinate system could help. Let me consider placing point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (10,0), and point B somewhere in the plane. Then, we can compute coordinates for B, then find the equation of the circumcircle, find the tangent lines at B and C to find D, then find the equation of AD and find its intersection with the circumcircle again at P. Then compute AP.\n\nThis might be a bit involved, but let's try.\n\nSo, let's assign coordinates:\n\nLet\u2019s set point C at (0,0). Point A is at (10,0). Point B is somewhere in the plane. Let\u2019s find the coordinates of B.\n\nGiven AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.\n\nSo, coordinates: A=(10,0), C=(0,0). Let\u2019s find B=(x,y). Then, distance from B to C is 9, so sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 9. Distance from B to A is 5: sqrt((x-10)\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =5.\n\nSo, two equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 81\n\n2. (x-10)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =25\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(x-10)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 =25 -81\n\nExpanding (x-10)\u00b2: x\u00b2 -20x +100 + y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -56\n\nSimplify: -20x + 100 = -56 => -20x = -156 => x= 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.\n\nSo, x=7.8, which is 39/5.\n\nNow, substitute x=39/5 into equation 1: (39/5)^2 + y^2 =81.\n\nCompute (39/5)^2: 39\u00b2=1521, so 1521/25 + y\u00b2 =81.\n\nSo, y\u00b2=81 -1521/25. 81 is 2025/25, so y\u00b2= (2025 -1521)/25=504/25.\n\nThus, y= sqrt(504/25)=sqrt(504)/5. Simplify sqrt(504): 504=16*31.5=16*9*3.5=16*9*7/2= (4\u00b2)(3\u00b2)(7/2). So, sqrt(504)=4*3*sqrt(14/4)=12*sqrt(14)/2=6*sqrt(14). Wait, wait, let me compute sqrt(504) correctly.\n\nWait, 504=16*31.5, which isn't helpful. Let me factor 504.\n\n504 divided by 2 is 252.\n\n252 divided by 2 is 126.\n\n126 divided by 2 is 63.\n\n63 is 7*9.\n\nSo, 504=2^3 * 3^2 *7.\n\nSo, sqrt(504)=sqrt(2^3 *3^2 *7)=2^(1.5)*3*sqrt(7)=2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7)=6*sqrt(14). Wait, no, 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)=sqrt(28), so 6*sqrt(28)=6*2*sqrt(7)=12*sqrt(7). Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, let's compute sqrt(504):\n\nsqrt(504) = sqrt(16 * 31.5) = 4 * sqrt(31.5). Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, sqrt(504) = sqrt(36 * 14) = 6*sqrt(14). Because 36*14=504. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, sqrt(504)=6*sqrt(14). So, y=6*sqrt(14)/5.\n\nSo, point B is at (39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo, coordinates:\n\nA=(10,0), B=(39/5, 6\u221a14/5), C=(0,0).\n\nNow, we need to find the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC.\n\nTo find the circumcircle, we can find the perpendicular bisectors of two sides and find their intersection point, which will be the circumcenter O.\n\nLet me compute the midpoint and slope of AB and AC.\n\nWait, AC is from (10,0) to (0,0). Midpoint is (5,0). The perpendicular bisector of AC is the line perpendicular to AC (which is along the x-axis), so the perpendicular bisector is the line x=5.\n\nNow, find the perpendicular bisector of AB.\n\nPoint A is (10,0), point B is (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). Let's compute the midpoint of AB.\n\nMidpoint M of AB:\n\nx-coordinate: (10 + 39/5)/2 = (50/5 + 39/5)/2 = (89/5)/2=89/10=8.9\n\ny-coordinate: (0 + 6\u221a14/5)/2 = (6\u221a14/5)/2=3\u221a14/5\n\nSo, midpoint M=(89/10, 3\u221a14/5).\n\nSlope of AB:\n\nSlope = (6\u221a14/5 - 0)/(39/5 -10) = (6\u221a14/5)/(39/5 -50/5) = (6\u221a14/5)/(-11/5) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nSo, the slope of AB is -6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, the perpendicular bisector of AB will have slope reciprocal and opposite: 11/(6\u221a14).\n\nSo, the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB is:\n\n(y - 3\u221a14/5) = (11/(6\u221a14))(x - 89/10)\n\nNow, since the circumcenter O lies at the intersection of the two perpendicular bisectors: x=5 and this line.\n\nSo, substituting x=5 into the equation:\n\ny - 3\u221a14/5 = (11/(6\u221a14))(5 - 89/10)\n\nCompute 5 - 89/10: 5 is 50/10, so 50/10 -89/10= -39/10.\n\nSo,\n\ny - 3\u221a14/5 = (11/(6\u221a14))*(-39/10) = (-429)/(60\u221a14) = (-143)/(20\u221a14)\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14 to rationalize:\n\n(-143\u221a14)/(20*14) = (-143\u221a14)/(280)\n\nSo, y= 3\u221a14/5 - 143\u221a14/280\n\nConvert 3\u221a14/5 to 280 denominator:\n\n3\u221a14/5 = (3\u221a14 * 56)/280 = 168\u221a14/280\n\nSo,\n\ny= (168\u221a14 -143\u221a14)/280 = (25\u221a14)/280 = (5\u221a14)/56\n\nSo, the circumcenter O is at (5, 5\u221a14/56).\n\nNow, having the circumradius, we can compute the equation of \u03c9.\n\nThe equation is (x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = R^2.\n\nWe can compute R using point A (10,0):\n\n(10-5)^2 + (0 -5\u221a14/56)^2 = R^2\n\nSo, 25 + (25*14)/(56\u00b2) = R^2\n\nCompute 25*14=350, 56\u00b2=3136.\n\nSo, 25 + 350/3136 = R^2.\n\nSimplify 350/3136: divide numerator and denominator by 14: 25/224.\n\nSo, R^2=25 +25/224=25*(1 +1/224)=25*(225/224)=5625/224.\n\nSo, R= sqrt(5625/224)=75/sqrt(224). Rationalize denominator: 75*sqrt(224)/224. Simplify sqrt(224)=sqrt(16*14)=4*sqrt(14). So, R=75*4*sqrt(14)/224= (300 sqrt(14))/224= (75 sqrt(14))/56.\n\nSo, the radius R is 75\u221a14/56.\n\nNow, we need to find the tangents from D to \u03c9. Wait, but we don't know D yet. Hmm, D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.\n\nWait, tangents at B and C. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB, and the tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC.\n\nSo, since we have the coordinates of O, we can find the equations of these tangents.\n\nFirst, let's find the equation of the tangent at B.\n\nPoint B is (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). The slope of OB is (6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56)/(39/5 -5). Let me compute that.\n\nCompute numerator: 6\u221a14/5 -5\u221a14/56.\n\nConvert to common denominator 280:\n\n6\u221a14/5 = 336\u221a14/280\n\n5\u221a14/56=25\u221a14/280\n\nSo, numerator=336\u221a14/280 -25\u221a14/280=311\u221a14/280.\n\nDenominator: 39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5=14/5.\n\nSo, slope of OB is (311\u221a14/280)/(14/5)= (311\u221a14/280)*(5/14)= (311\u221a14 *5)/(280*14)= (1555\u221a14)/(3920).\n\nSimplify: divide numerator and denominator by 5: 311\u221a14/784.\n\nSo, the slope of OB is 311\u221a14/784.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal.\n\nSo, slope of tangent at B: m1= -784/(311\u221a14).\n\nSimilarly, compute the equation of tangent at B.\n\nUsing point-slope form: y - y_B = m1 (x -x_B).\n\nSo,\n\ny - 6\u221a14/5 = (-784/(311\u221a14))(x -39/5)\n\nSimilarly, find the equation of tangent at C.\n\nPoint C is (0,0). The radius OC is from O (5,5\u221a14/56) to C (0,0). So, slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56 -0)/(5 -0)= (5\u221a14/56)/5= \u221a14/56.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: m2= -56/\u221a14.\n\nSimplify m2: 56/\u221a14=56\u221a14/14=4\u221a14. So, m2= -4\u221a14.\n\nSo, equation of tangent at C: y -0 = -4\u221a14 (x -0), so y= -4\u221a14 x.\n\nNow, we have two tangent lines: at B and at C.\n\nWe can find their intersection point D by solving their equations.\n\nEquation of tangent at B: y = (-784/(311\u221a14))(x -39/5) +6\u221a14/5\n\nEquation of tangent at C: y= -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSet them equal:\n\n-4\u221a14 x = (-784/(311\u221a14))(x -39/5) +6\u221a14/5\n\nMultiply both sides by 311\u221a14 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4\u221a14 *311\u221a14 x = -784 (x -39/5) +6\u221a14/5 *311\u221a14\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side: -4*311*(\u221a14)^2 x = -4*311*14 x = -4*4354 x= -17416 x.\n\nRight side: -784x + (784*39)/5 +6*311*(\u221a14)^2 /5.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: -784x.\n\nSecond term: (784*39)/5. Let's compute 784*39.\n\n784 * 40=31360, so 784*39=31360 -784=30576. So, 30576/5.\n\nThird term:6*311*(14)/5. Compute 6*311=1866, 1866*14=26124. So, 26124/5.\n\nSo, right side becomes: -784x + (30576 +26124)/5= -784x +56700/5= -784x +11340.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n-17416x = -784x +11340.\n\nBring -784x to the left:\n\n-17416x +784x =11340.\n\nCompute -17416 +784= -16632.\n\nSo, -16632x=11340.\n\nThus, x=11340 / (-16632).\n\nSimplify this fraction.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 12: 11340/12=945, 16632/12=1386.\n\nSo, 945/-1386.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 21: 945/21=45, 1386/21=66.\n\nSo, 45/-66. Divide by 3: 15/-22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nThen, y= -4\u221a14 x= -4\u221a14*(-15/22)=60\u221a14/22=30\u221a14/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, we have point A at (10,0) and point D at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11). We need to find the equation of line AD and find its other intersection point P with \u03c9.\n\nFirst, find the parametric equations or the equation of line AD.\n\nCompute the slope of AD:\n\nSlope m_AD= (30\u221a14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10)= (30\u221a14/11)/(-15/22 -220/22)= (30\u221a14/11)/(-235/22)= (30\u221a14/11)*(-22/235)= (30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235)= Simplify:\n\n30 and 235: 30 and 235 share a factor of 5: 30=5*6, 235=5*47.\n\n22 and 11: 22=2*11.\n\nSo,\n\n(30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235)= (6\u221a14*(-2))/(47)= (-12\u221a14)/47.\n\nSo, slope m_AD= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nSo, equation of AD: y -0= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nSo, y= (-12\u221a14/47)x + 120\u221a14/47.\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of this line with \u03c9, which is the circumcircle.\n\nThe equation of \u03c9 is (x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nLet me expand this equation.\n\nFirst, expand (x -5)^2= x\u00b2 -10x +25.\n\nThen, (y -5\u221a14/56)^2= y\u00b2 - (10\u221a14/56)y + (25*14)/(56\u00b2)= y\u00b2 - (5\u221a14/28)y + 350/3136= y\u00b2 - (5\u221a14/28)y + 25/224.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 -10x +25 + y\u00b2 - (5\u221a14/28)y +25/224 = (75\u00b2 *14)/(56\u00b2).\n\nCompute RHS: (75\u00b2 *14)/(56\u00b2)= (5625 *14)/(3136)= (78750)/3136.\n\nSimplify 78750/3136: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 39375/1568.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nx\u00b2 -10x +25 + y\u00b2 - (5\u221a14/28)y +25/224 =39375/1568.\n\nMultiply all terms by 1568 to eliminate denominators:\n\n1568x\u00b2 -15680x +1568*25 +1568y\u00b2 -1568*(5\u221a14/28)y +1568*(25/224)=39375.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1568x\u00b2 -15680x +39200 +1568y\u00b2 - (1568*5\u221a14)/28 y + (1568*25)/224 =39375.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n1568x\u00b2 -15680x +39200 +1568y\u00b2 - (1568/28)*5\u221a14 y + (1568/224)*25 =39375.\n\nCompute:\n\n1568/28=56, so -56*5\u221a14 y= -280\u221a14 y.\n\n1568/224=7, so 7*25=175.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n1568x\u00b2 -15680x +39200 +1568y\u00b2 -280\u221a14 y +175 =39375.\n\nCombine constants: 39200 +175=39375.\n\nSo,\n\n1568x\u00b2 -15680x +1568y\u00b2 -280\u221a14 y +39375 =39375.\n\nSubtract 39375 from both sides:\n\n1568x\u00b2 -15680x +1568y\u00b2 -280\u221a14 y=0.\n\nDivide entire equation by 28 to simplify:\n\n56x\u00b2 -560x +56y\u00b2 -10\u221a14 y=0.\n\nSo, equation:56x\u00b2 -560x +56y\u00b2 -10\u221a14 y=0.\n\nNow, let's plug in the equation of AD into this.\n\nFrom AD: y= (-12\u221a14/47)x + 120\u221a14/47.\n\nSo, y= m x + c, where m= -12\u221a14/47, c=120\u221a14/47.\n\nLet me substitute y into the circle equation.\n\nSo, substitute y = m x + c into 56x\u00b2 -560x +56y\u00b2 -10\u221a14 y=0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n56x\u00b2 -560x +56(m x + c)^2 -10\u221a14 (m x + c)=0.\n\nExpand (m x + c)^2= m\u00b2x\u00b2 + 2 m c x + c\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n56x\u00b2 -560x +56(m\u00b2x\u00b2 + 2 m c x + c\u00b2) -10\u221a14 (m x + c)=0.\n\nMultiply out:\n\n56x\u00b2 -560x +56m\u00b2x\u00b2 + 112 m c x +56 c\u00b2 -10\u221a14 m x -10\u221a14 c=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx\u00b2 terms:56 +56m\u00b2.\n\nx terms: -560 +112 m c -10\u221a14 m.\n\nconstants:56 c\u00b2 -10\u221a14 c.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n(56 +56m\u00b2)x\u00b2 + (-560 +112 m c -10\u221a14 m)x + (56 c\u00b2 -10\u221a14 c)=0.\n\nNow, since point A is on both the line AD and the circle, x=10 is a root of this equation. So, (x -10) is a factor. The other root will correspond to point P.\n\nTherefore, we can factor this quadratic equation as (x -10)(something)=0.\n\nLet me denote the quadratic as A x\u00b2 + B x + C=0, where:\n\nA=56 +56m\u00b2.\n\nB= -560 +112 m c -10\u221a14 m.\n\nC=56 c\u00b2 -10\u221a14 c.\n\nWe know that x=10 is a root, so:\n\nA*(10)^2 + B*(10) + C=0.\n\nBut instead of computing that, maybe we can find the other root using Vieta's formula.\n\nIn a quadratic equation, the sum of the roots is -B/A.\n\nSince one root is 10, the other root is t, so 10 + t= -B/A => t= -B/A -10.\n\nSo, let's compute A, B, C.\n\nCompute A=56 +56m\u00b2.\n\nm= -12\u221a14/47, so m\u00b2= (144*14)/(47\u00b2)= 2016/2209.\n\nSo, A=56 +56*(2016/2209)=56[1 +2016/2209]=56*(2209 +2016)/2209=56*(4225)/2209.\n\n4225=65\u00b2, 2209=47\u00b2.\n\nSo, A=56*(65\u00b2)/(47\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, compute B= -560 +112 m c -10\u221a14 m.\n\nFirst, compute m c:\n\nm= -12\u221a14/47, c=120\u221a14/47.\n\nSo, m c= (-12\u221a14/47)(120\u221a14/47)= (-12*120)*(14)/(47\u00b2)= (-1440)*(14)/2209= (-20160)/2209.\n\n112 m c=112*(-20160)/2209= (-226,  112*20160= let's compute 112*20160=112*20000 +112*160=2,240,000 +17,920=2,257,920.

Wait, 169*7=1,183. Wait, 169*7=1,183? No, 169*7=1,183? Wait, 169*7=1,183? Let me compute 169*7: 100*7=700, 60*7=420, 9*7=63. 700+420=1,120 +63=1,183. Yes.\n\nSo, 1,300=1,183 +117. 169*7=1,183, 169*7 +117=1,300.\n\nSo, 1,300=169*7 +117=169*7 + (169 -52)=169*8 -52.\n\nBut maybe it's better to compute 1300/169.\n\nDivide 1300 \u00f7169:\n\n169*7=1,183.\n\n1300 -1,183=117.\n\n169 goes into 117 zero times.

So, 1300/169=100/13.\n\nBecause 169*100=16,900; 1300*13=16,900. Yes, 1300/169=100/13.\n\nSo, AP=100/13.\n\nTherefore, AP=100/13, which is already in lowest terms since 100 and 13 are coprime.\n\nThus, m=100, n=13, so m +n=113.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem where we have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents to \u03c9 at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects \u03c9 again at point P. We're given the lengths AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find AP expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime integers, and then compute m + n.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, let me visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle \u03c9 is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, line AD intersects \u03c9 again at P, and we need to find AP.\n\nHmm, tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. So, DB and DC should be equal because they're both tangents from D to \u03c9. That might come in handy.\n\nI remember that when dealing with tangents to a circle, there are some properties we can use. For instance, the power of a point. The power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2, since DB and DC are tangents. Also, since AD intersects \u03c9 at P, by the power of point A with respect to \u03c9, we have AP * AD = AB * AC, but wait, is that correct? Wait, no. The power of point A with respect to \u03c9 is zero because A lies on \u03c9. So, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider using power of point D. Since D is outside the circle, its power is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DP * DA. Because AD is a secant from D passing through P. So, Power of D: DB\u00b2 = DP * DA.\n\nSo, if I can find DB, then I can relate DP and DA. Let me note that down.\n\nSo, DB\u00b2 = DP * DA.\n\nWe need to find AP. Let's denote AP as x. Then, since P is on AD, AP = x, and PD = AD - AP = AD - x.\n\nWait, but in the power of a point formula, it's DP * DA. Hmm, let me clarify. The power of D is equal to DB\u00b2 = DP * DA. But in this case, AD passes through P, so the power is DB\u00b2 = DP * DA. But DP is the length from D to P, which is equal to DA - AP. Wait, no. Wait, AD is from A to D, passing through P. So, starting from D, moving towards A, the first intersection with the circle is P, then A is outside the circle? Wait, no, A is on the circle, because ABC is inscribed in \u03c9. So, A is on \u03c9, so AD starts at A (on \u03c9), goes through P (another point on \u03c9), and then to D (outside \u03c9). So, the order is A --- P --- D. Therefore, DA is the entire length from D to A, and DP is the part from D to P, which is DA - AP. Wait, no: DA is the distance from D to A, and AP is from A to P, so DP is DA - AP? Hmm, let's think again.\n\nWait, if you have a point D outside the circle, and a secant D-P-A, meaning P is between D and A, then the power of point D is DP * DA. But since P is between D and A, and A is on the circle, then DA is the entire length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So, DP * DA would actually be DP * (DP + PA). Wait, no, DA is DP + PA. So, Power of D is DP * (DP + PA) = DB\u00b2.\n\nSo, if I let AP = x, then DA = DP + PA, but I don't know DP yet. Alternatively, let me denote AD as t, so that AP is x, and PD is t - x. Then, according to the power of point D, DB\u00b2 = DP * DA = (t - x) * t.\n\nSo, DB\u00b2 = t(t - x). But I don't know DB or t (which is AD). Hmm, so perhaps I need another equation to relate these variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can compute DB using triangle properties. Let me think about triangle ABC. Since ABC has sides 5,9,10, perhaps we can compute some angles or other lengths.\n\nWait, perhaps we can use Stewart's theorem or the Law of Cosines to find the circumradius or other lengths.\n\nWait, another approach is to use coordinate geometry. Maybe placing triangle ABC in a coordinate system could help. Let me consider placing point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (10,0), and point B somewhere in the plane. Then, we can compute coordinates for B, then find the equation of the circumcircle, find the tangent lines at B and C to find D, then find the equation of AD and find its intersection with the circumcircle again at P. Then compute AP.\n\nThis might be a bit involved, but let's try.\n\nSo, let's assign coordinates:\n\nLet\u2019s set point C at (0,0). Point A is at (10,0). Point B is somewhere in the plane. Let\u2019s find the coordinates of B.\n\nGiven AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.\n\nSo, coordinates: A=(10,0), C=(0,0). Let\u2019s find B=(x,y). Then, distance from B to C is 9, so sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 9. Distance from B to A is 5: sqrt((x-10)\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =5.\n\nSo, two equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 81\n\n2. (x-10)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =25\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(x-10)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 =25 -81\n\nExpanding (x-10)\u00b2: x\u00b2 -20x +100 + y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -56\n\nSimplify: -20x + 100 = -56 => -20x = -156 => x= 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.\n\nSo, x=7.8, which is 39/5.\n\nNow, substitute x=39/5 into equation 1: (39/5)^2 + y^2 =81.\n\nCompute (39/5)^2: 39\u00b2=1521, so 1521/25 + y\u00b2 =81.\n\nSo, y\u00b2=81 -1521/25. 81 is 2025/25, so y\u00b2= (2025 -1521)/25=504/25.\n\nThus, y= sqrt(504/25)=sqrt(504)/5. Simplify sqrt(504): 504=16*31.5=16*9*3.5=16*9*7/2= (4\u00b2)(3\u00b2)(7/2). So, sqrt(504)=4*3*sqrt(14/4)=12*sqrt(14)/2=6*sqrt(14). Wait, wait, let me compute sqrt(504) correctly.\n\nWait, 504=16*31.5, which isn't helpful. Let me factor 504.\n\n504 divided by 2 is 252.\n\n252 divided by 2 is 126.\n\n126 divided by 2 is 63.\n\n63 is 7*9.\n\nSo, 504=2^3 * 3^2 *7.\n\nSo, sqrt(504)=sqrt(2^3 *3^2 *7)=2^(1.5)*3*sqrt(7)=2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7)=6*sqrt(14). Wait, no, 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)=sqrt(28), so 6*sqrt(28)=6*2*sqrt(7)=12*sqrt(7). Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, let's compute sqrt(504):\n\nsqrt(504) = sqrt(16 * 31.5) = 4 * sqrt(31.5). Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, sqrt(504) = sqrt(36 * 14) = 6*sqrt(14). Because 36*14=504. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, sqrt(504)=6*sqrt(14). So, y=6*sqrt(14)/5.\n\nSo, point B is at (39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo, coordinates:\n\nA=(10,0), B=(39/5, 6\u221a14/5), C=(0,0).\n\nNow, we need to find the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC.\n\nTo find the circumcircle, we can find the perpendicular bisectors of two sides and find their intersection point, which will be the circumcenter O.\n\nLet me compute the midpoint and slope of AB and AC.\n\nWait, AC is from (10,0) to (0,0). Midpoint is (5,0). The perpendicular bisector of AC is the line perpendicular to AC (which is along the x-axis), so the perpendicular bisector is the line x=5.\n\nNow, find the perpendicular bisector of AB.\n\nPoint A is (10,0), point B is (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). Let's compute the midpoint of AB.\n\nMidpoint M of AB:\n\nx-coordinate: (10 + 39/5)/2 = (50/5 + 39/5)/2 = (89/5)/2=89/10=8.9\n\ny-coordinate: (0 + 6\u221a14/5)/2 = (6\u221a14/5)/2=3\u221a14/5\n\nSo, midpoint M=(89/10, 3\u221a14/5).\n\nSlope of AB:\n\nSlope = (6\u221a14/5 - 0)/(39/5 -10) = (6\u221a14/5)/(39/5 -50/5) = (6\u221a14/5)/(-11/5) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nSo, the slope of AB is -6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, the perpendicular bisector of AB will have slope reciprocal and opposite: 11/(6\u221a14).\n\nSo, the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB is:\n\n(y - 3\u221a14/5) = (11/(6\u221a14))(x - 89/10)\n\nNow, since the circumcenter O lies at the intersection of the two perpendicular bisectors: x=5 and this line.\n\nSo, substituting x=5 into the equation:\n\ny - 3\u221a14/5 = (11/(6\u221a14))(5 - 89/10)\n\nCompute 5 - 89/10: 5 is 50/10, so 50/10 -89/10= -39/10.\n\nSo,\n\ny - 3\u221a14/5 = (11/(6\u221a14))*(-39/10) = (-429)/(60\u221a14) = (-143)/(20\u221a14)\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14 to rationalize:\n\n(-143\u221a14)/(20*14) = (-143\u221a14)/(280)\n\nSo, y= 3\u221a14/5 - 143\u221a14/280\n\nConvert 3\u221a14/5 to 280 denominator:\n\n3\u221a14/5 = (3\u221a14 * 56)/280 = 168\u221a14/280\n\nSo,\n\ny= (168\u221a14 -143\u221a14)/280 = (25\u221a14)/280 = (5\u221a14)/56\n\nSo, the circumcenter O is at (5, 5\u221a14/56).\n\nNow, having the circumradius, we can compute the equation of \u03c9.\n\nThe equation is (x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = R^2.\n\nWe can compute R using point A (10,0):\n\n(10-5)^2 + (0 -5\u221a14/56)^2 = R^2\n\nSo, 25 + (25*14)/(56\u00b2) = R^2\n\nCompute 25*14=350, 56\u00b2=3136.\n\nSo, 25 + 350/3136 = R^2.\n\nSimplify 350/3136: divide numerator and denominator by 14: 25/224.\n\nSo, R^2=25 +25/224=25*(1 +1/224)=25*(225/224)=5625/224.\n\nSo, R= sqrt(5625/224)=75/sqrt(224). Rationalize denominator: 75*sqrt(224)/224. Simplify sqrt(224)=sqrt(16*14)=4*sqrt(14). So, R=75*4*sqrt(14)/224= (300 sqrt(14))/224= (75 sqrt(14))/56.\n\nSo, the radius R is 75\u221a14/56.\n\nNow, we need to find the tangents from D to \u03c9. Wait, but we don't know D yet. Hmm, D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.\n\nWait, tangents at B and C. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB, and the tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC.\n\nSo, since we have the coordinates of O, we can find the equations of these tangents.\n\nFirst, let's find the equation of the tangent at B.\n\nPoint B is (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). The slope of OB is (6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56)/(39/5 -5). Let me compute that.\n\nCompute numerator: 6\u221a14/5 -5\u221a14/56.\n\nConvert to common denominator 280:\n\n6\u221a14/5 = 336\u221a14/280\n\n5\u221a14/56=25\u221a14/280\n\nSo, numerator=336\u221a14/280 -25\u221a14/280=311\u221a14/280.\n\nDenominator: 39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5=14/5.\n\nSo, slope of OB is (311\u221a14/280)/(14/5)= (311\u221a14/280)*(5/14)= (311\u221a14 *5)/(280*14)= (1555\u221a14)/(3920).\n\nSimplify: divide numerator and denominator by 5: 311\u221a14/784.\n\nSo, the slope of OB is 311\u221a14/784.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal.\n\nSo, slope of tangent at B: m1= -784/(311\u221a14).\n\nSimilarly, compute the equation of tangent at B.\n\nUsing point-slope form: y - y_B = m1 (x -x_B).\n\nSo,\n\ny - 6\u221a14/5 = (-784/(311\u221a14))(x -39/5)\n\nSimilarly, find the equation of tangent at C.\n\nPoint C is (0,0). The radius OC is from O (5,5\u221a14/56) to C (0,0). So, slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56 -0)/(5 -0)= (5\u221a14/56)/5= \u221a14/56.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: m2= -56/\u221a14.\n\nSimplify m2: 56/\u221a14=56\u221a14/14=4\u221a14. So, m2= -4\u221a14.\n\nSo, equation of tangent at C: y -0 = -4\u221a14 (x -0), so y= -4\u221a14 x.\n\nNow, we have two tangent lines: at B and at C.\n\nWe can find their intersection point D by solving their equations.\n\nEquation of tangent at B: y = (-784/(311\u221a14))(x -39/5) +6\u221a14/5\n\nEquation of tangent at C: y= -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSet them equal:\n\n-4\u221a14 x = (-784/(311\u221a14))(x -39/5) +6\u221a14/5\n\nMultiply both sides by 311\u221a14 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4\u221a14 *311\u221a14 x = -784 (x -39/5) +6\u221a14/5 *311\u221a14\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side: -4*311*(\u221a14)^2 x = -4*311*14 x = -4*4354 x= -17416 x.\n\nRight side: -784x + (784*39)/5 +6*311*(\u221a14)^2 /5.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: -784x.\n\nSecond term: (784*39)/5. Let's compute 784*39.\n\n784 * 40=31360, so 784*39=31360 -784=30576. So, 30576/5.\n\nThird term:6*311*(14)/5. Compute 6*311=1866, 1866*14=26124. So, 26124/5.\n\nSo, right side becomes: -784x + (30576 +26124)/5= -784x +56700/5= -784x +11340.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n-17416x = -784x +11340.\n\nBring -784x to the left:\n\n-17416x +784x =11340.\n\nCompute -17416 +784= -16632.\n\nSo, -16632x=11340.\n\nThus, x=11340 / (-16632).\n\nSimplify this fraction.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 12: 11340/12=945, 16632/12=1386.\n\nSo, 945/-1386.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 21: 945/21=45, 1386/21=66.\n\nSo, 45/-66. Divide by 3: 15/-22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nThen, y= -4\u221a14 x= -4\u221a14*(-15/22)=60\u221a14/22=30\u221a14/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, we have point A at (10,0) and point D at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11). We need to find the equation of line AD and find its other intersection point P with \u03c9.\n\nFirst, find the parametric equations or the equation of line AD.\n\nCompute the slope of AD:\n\nSlope m_AD= (30\u221a14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10)= (30\u221a14/11)/(-15/22 -220/22)= (30\u221a14/11)/(-235/22)= (30\u221a14/11)*(-22/235)= (30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235)= Simplify:\n\n30 and 235: 30 and 235 share a factor of 5: 30=5*6, 235=5*47.\n\n22 and 11: 22=2*11.\n\nSo,\n\n(30\u221a14 * (-22))/(11*235)= (6\u221a14*(-2))/(47)= (-12\u221a14)/47.\n\nSo, slope m_AD= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nSo, equation of AD: y -0= (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nSo, y= (-12\u221a14/47)x + 120\u221a14/47.\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of this line with \u03c9, which is the circumcircle.\n\nThe equation of \u03c9 is (x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nLet me expand this equation.\n\nFirst, expand (x -5)^2= x\u00b2 -10x +25.\n\nThen, (y -5\u221a14/56)^2= y\u00b2 - (10\u221a14/56)y + (25*14)/(56\u00b2)= y\u00b2 - (5\u221a14/28)y + 350/3136= y\u00b2 - (5\u221a14/28)y + 25/224.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 -10x +25 + y\u00b2 - (5\u221a14/28)y +25/224 = (75\u00b2 *14)/(56\u00b2).\n\nCompute RHS: (75\u00b2 *14)/(56\u00b2)= (5625 *14)/(3136)= (78750)/3136.\n\nSimplify 78750/3136: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 39375/1568.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nx\u00b2 -10x +25 + y\u00b2 - (5\u221a14/28)y +25/224 =39375/1568.\n\nMultiply all terms by 1568 to eliminate denominators:\n\n1568x\u00b2 -15680x +1568*25 +1568y\u00b2 -1568*(5\u221a14/28)y +1568*(25/224)=39375.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1568x\u00b2 -15680x +39200 +1568y\u00b2 - (1568*5\u221a14)/28 y + (1568*25)/224 =39375.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n1568x\u00b2 -15680x +39200 +1568y\u00b2 - (1568/28)*5\u221a14 y + (1568/224)*25 =39375.\n\nCompute:\n\n1568/28=56, so -56*5\u221a14 y= -280\u221a14 y.\n\n1568/224=7, so 7*25=175.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n1568x\u00b2 -15680x +39200 +1568y\u00b2 -280\u221a14 y +175 =39375.\n\nCombine constants: 39200 +175=39375.\n\nSo,\n\n1568x\u00b2 -15680x +1568y\u00b2 -280\u221a14 y +39375 =39375.\n\nSubtract 39375 from both sides:\n\n1568x\u00b2 -15680x +1568y\u00b2 -280\u221a14 y=0.\n\nDivide entire equation by 28 to simplify:\n\n56x\u00b2 -560x +56y\u00b2 -10\u221a14 y=0.\n\nSo, equation:56x\u00b2 -560x +56y\u00b2 -10\u221a14 y=0.\n\nNow, let's plug in the equation of AD into this.\n\nFrom AD: y= (-12\u221a14/47)x + 120\u221a14/47.\n\nSo, y= m x + c, where m= -12\u221a14/47, c=120\u221a14/47.\n\nLet me substitute y into the circle equation.\n\nSo, substitute y = m x + c into 56x\u00b2 -560x +56y\u00b2 -10\u221a14 y=0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n56x\u00b2 -560x +56(m x + c)^2 -10\u221a14 (m x + c)=0.\n\nExpand (m x + c)^2= m\u00b2x\u00b2 + 2 m c x + c\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n56x\u00b2 -560x +56(m\u00b2x\u00b2 + 2 m c x + c\u00b2) -10\u221a14 (m x + c)=0.\n\nMultiply out:\n\n56x\u00b2 -560x +56m\u00b2x\u00b2 + 112 m c x +56 c\u00b2 -10\u221a14 m x -10\u221a14 c=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx\u00b2 terms:56 +56m\u00b2.\n\nx terms: -560 +112 m c -10\u221a14 m.\n\nconstants:56 c\u00b2 -10\u221a14 c.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n(56 +56m\u00b2)x\u00b2 + (-560 +112 m c -10\u221a14 m)x + (56 c\u00b2 -10\u221a14 c)=0.\n\nNow, since point A is on both the line AD and the circle, x=10 is a root of this equation. So, (x -10) is a factor. The other root will correspond to point P.\n\nTherefore, we can factor this quadratic equation as (x -10)(something)=0.\n\nLet me denote the quadratic as A x\u00b2 + B x + C=0, where:\n\nA=56 +56m\u00b2.\n\nB= -560 +112 m c -10\u221a14 m.\n\nC=56 c\u00b2 -10\u221a14 c.\n\nWe know that x=10 is a root, so:\n\nA*(10)^2 + B*(10) + C=0.\n\nBut instead of computing that, maybe we can find the other root using Vieta's formula.\n\nIn a quadratic equation, the sum of the roots is -B/A.\n\nSince one root is 10, the other root is t, so 10 + t= -B/A => t= -B/A -10.\n\nSo, let's compute A, B, C.\n\nCompute A=56 +56m\u00b2.\n\nm= -12\u221a14/47, so m\u00b2= (144*14)/(47\u00b2)= 2016/2209.\n\nSo, A=56 +56*(2016/2209)=56[1 +2016/2209]=56*(2209 +2016)/2209=56*(4225)/2209.\n\n4225=65\u00b2, 2209=47\u00b2.\n\nSo, A=56*(65\u00b2)/(47\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, compute B= -560 +112 m c -10\u221a14 m.\n\nFirst, compute m c:\n\nm= -12\u221a14/47, c=120\u221a14/47.\n\nSo, m c= (-12\u221a14/47)(120\u221a14/47)= (-12*120)*(14)/(47\u00b2)= (-1440)*(14)/2209= (-20160)/2209.\n\n112 m c=112*(-20160)/2209= (-226,  112*20160= let's compute 112*20160=112*20000 +112*160=2,240,000 +17,920=2,257,920. So, 112 m c= -2,257,920 /2209.\n\nThen, compute -10\u221a14 m:\n\nm= -12\u221a14/47.\n\nSo, -10\u221a14 m= -10\u221a14*(-12\u221a14)/47= (120*14)/47=1680/47.\n\nSo, B= -560 + (-2,257,920)/2209 +1680/47.\n\nConvert all terms to denominator 2209:\n\n-560= -560*(2209/2209)= -560*2209/2209.\n\nCompute 560*2209: 560*2000=1,120,000; 560*209=560*(200+9)=112,000 +5,040=117,040. So total=1,120,000 +117,040=1,237,040. So, -560= -1,237,040/2209.\n\nSimilarly, 1680/47= (1680*47)/2209. Compute 1680*47: 1600*47=75,200; 80*47=3,760. So total=75,200 +3,760=78,960. So, 1680/47=78,960/2209.\n\nSo, B= (-1,237,040/2209) + (-2,257,920/2209) + (78,960/2209).\n\nAdd them together:\n\n(-1,237,040 -2,257,920 +78,960)/2209= (-3,519,  1,237,040 +2,257,920=3,494,960; 3,494,960 -78,960=3,416,000; so total is -3,416,000)/2209.\n\nSo, B= -3,416,000/2209.\n\nSimilarly, compute C=56 c\u00b2 -10\u221a14 c.\n\nCompute c=120\u221a14/47.\n\nc\u00b2= (120\u00b2 *14)/47\u00b2= (14,400 *14)/2209=201,600/2209.\n\nSo, 56 c\u00b2=56*(201,600/2209)=11,305,600/2209.\n\nCompute 10\u221a14 c=10\u221a14*(120\u221a14)/47=10*120*(14)/47=12,000*14/47=168,000/47.\n\nSo, 10\u221a14 c=168,000/47= (168,000 *47)/2209.

Let me set t as a parameter such that when t=0, we are at point A (10,0), and t=1, we are at point D (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nWait, but maybe a better parameterization would be to set point A as (10,0), and vector AD as D - A.\n\nVector AD: from A(10,0) to D(-15/22,30\u221a14/11) is (-15/22 -10, 30\u221a14/11 -0)= (-235/22,30\u221a14/11).\n\nSo, parametric equations:\n\nx=10 + (-235/22)*s\n\ny=0 + (30\u221a14/11)*s\n\nWhere s=0 at A, s=1 at D.\n\nWe need to find s such that (x,y) lies on \u03c9.\n\nSubstitute into \u03c9's equation:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nCompute (x-5)^2:\n\nx=10 - (235/22)s.\n\nx-5=5 - (235/22)s.\n\nSo, (x-5)^2= [5 - (235/22)s]^2=25 - 2*5*(235/22)s + (235/22)^2 s\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, y= (30\u221a14/11)s.\n\ny -5\u221a14/56= (30\u221a14/11)s -5\u221a14/56=\u221a14 [30/11 s -5/56].\n\nLet me factor \u221a14:\n\n=\u221a14 [ (30*56 s -5*11)/(11*56) ]=\u221a14 [ (1680 s -55)/616 ].\n\nSo, (y -5\u221a14/56)^2=14*(1680 s -55)^2/(616)^2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n25 - (2350/22)s + (235\u00b2/22\u00b2)s\u00b2 +14*(1680 s -55)^2/(616\u00b2) = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nCompute RHS: (75\u221a14/56)^2= (5625 *14)/(56\u00b2)=78,750/3,136=78,750 \u00f73,136\u224825.11.\n\nBut let's keep it as 78,750/3,136.\n\nNow, let's compute each term.\n\nFirst, expand the left side:\n\nTerm1:25.\n\nTerm2: - (2350/22)s= -2350/22 s= -1175/11 s.\n\nTerm3: (235\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) s\u00b2= (55,225)/(484)s\u00b2.\n\nTerm4:14*(1680 s -55)^2/(616\u00b2).\n\nCompute (1680 s -55)^2= (1680 s)^2 -2*1680*55 s +55\u00b2=2,822,400 s\u00b2 -184,800 s +3,025.\n\nSo, term4=14*(2,822,400 s\u00b2 -184,800 s +3,025)/ (616\u00b2).\n\nCompute 616\u00b2=379,456.\n\nSo, term4=14*(2,822,400 s\u00b2 -184,800 s +3,025)/379,456.\n\nSimplify:\n\n14/379,456=7/189,728.\n\nSo, term4=7*(2,822,400 s\u00b2 -184,800 s +3,025)/189,728.\n\nLet me compute each coefficient:\n\n7*2,822,400=19,756,800\n\n7*(-184,800)= -1,293,600\n\n7*3,025=21,175.\n\nSo, term4= (19,756,800 s\u00b2 -1,293,600 s +21,175)/189,728.\n\nSo, the entire left side is:\n\n25 - (1175/11)s + (55,225/484)s\u00b2 + (19,756,800 s\u00b2 -1,293,600 s +21,175)/189,728.\n\nSet equal to RHS 78,750/3,136.\n\nMultiply both sides by 189,728 to eliminate denominators:\n\n25*189,728 - (1175/11)*189,728 s + (55,225/484)*189,728 s\u00b2 +19,756,800 s\u00b2 -1,293,600 s +21,175 = (78,750/3,136)*189,728.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nCompute 25*189,728=4,743,200.\n\nCompute (1175/11)*189,728: 1175/11=106.818..., but let's compute 1175*189,728 /11.\n\n1175 \u00f711=106.818...

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents at B and C meet at D, and AD intersects \u03c9 again at P. The sides are given: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. I need to express AP as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle \u03c9 is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. So, D is the ex-pole of BC? Or maybe it's the ex-pole related to some other point. Hmm, I'm not sure about that terminology. But tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length, so BD = CD. That might come in handy.\n\nAD intersects \u03c9 again at P. So, AD is a secant of the circle, passing through A and D, and intersecting the circle at A and P. So, by the Power of a Point theorem, the power of point D with respect to \u03c9 should be equal to DB\u00b2 (since DB is the tangent from D to \u03c9). Also, the power of D is equal to DP * DA. Wait, no, actually, the power is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2, and since AD is a secant, the power is also DP * DA. But wait, AD is from D to A, which is outside the circle, so the power should be DB\u00b2 = DP * DA. Wait, actually, the Power of a Point says that for a point outside the circle, the power is equal to the square of the tangent length, which is DB\u00b2, and also equal to the product of the lengths from the point to the intersection points of any secant. So, yes, DB\u00b2 = DP * DA.\n\nWait, but in the problem, AD intersects \u03c9 at P. So, the entire length from D to P is DP, and from D to A is DA. So, if I let DA = x, then DP = x - AP, but wait, no. Wait, AP is the segment from A to P, so if DA is the entire length from D to A, then DP would be DA - AP? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, if you have point D, then the line DA goes through A and then to P on the circle. So, the order is D, then A, then P. So, DA is the segment from D to A, and DP is from D to P, which is longer than DA. So, DP = DA + AP. Wait, but that can't be because P is on the circle, which is on the other side from D. Wait, maybe I have the order wrong. Maybe it's D, then P, then A? Because the tangent points are at B and C, so D is outside the circle, and AD is a secant that starts at D, goes through the circle at P, and then exits at A. Wait, that makes more sense because A is on the circle, so AD is a secant that starts outside the circle at D, enters at P, and then exits at A. So, the points are D---P---A. Therefore, DP * DA = DB\u00b2, but wait, no. Wait, the Power of a Point theorem states that for a point D outside the circle, the power is equal to the product of the lengths from D to the two intersection points of any secant line through D. So, if the secant intersects the circle at P and A, then the power is DP * DA. But wait, the power is also equal to DB\u00b2, since DB is the tangent. So, DB\u00b2 = DP * DA.\n\nWait, no, the order is important. If the points are D---P---A, then the lengths are DP (from D to P) and DA (from D to A). But DA is longer than DP because A is further from D than P is. So, actually, the correct formula is DB\u00b2 = DP * DA. But wait, that would be if the secant is DP and PA, but no, the two segments from D are DP and DA, but DA is beyond P. So, in Power of a Point, it's DP * DA, but since A is beyond P, the correct formula is DP * DA = DB\u00b2. Wait, but that would imply that DA is from D to A, passing through P, so DA is longer than DP. So, actually, DA = DP + PA. So, if I let DA = x, then DP = x - PA. But I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write it as DP * DA = DB\u00b2. But if the points are D, P, A, then DA is the entire length from D to A, which is DP + PA. So, the Power of a Point formula is DP * DA = DB\u00b2. So, DP * (DP + PA) = DB\u00b2. But I don't know DP or PA yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use coordinate geometry. But that might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe use inversion or some other methods, but perhaps using similar triangles or harmonic division.\n\nWait, another approach: Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the ex-similicenter of the circumcircle. Maybe I can use properties related to poles and polars, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute the coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry.\n\nLet me place the triangle in the coordinate plane. Let me set point C at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, point A is at (10, 0), because AC is 10 units. Point B is somewhere in the plane. Given that AB is 5 and BC is 9, I can find the coordinates of B.\n\nSo, points: C(0,0), A(10,0). Let me denote point B as (x,y). Then, the distance from B to C is 9: \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 9, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 81.\n\nThe distance from B to A is 5: \u221a((x - 10)\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 5, so (x - 10)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 25.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second: (x - 10)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 25 - 81 => x\u00b2 -20x + 100 + y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -56 => -20x + 100 = -56 => -20x = -156 => x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.\n\nSo, x = 7.8, which is 39/5. Then, plug into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 81: (39/5)^2 + y\u00b2 = 81.\n\nCalculating (39/5)^2: 39^2 = 1521, so 1521/25 + y\u00b2 = 81.\n\nConvert 81 to 25ths: 81 = 2025/25.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 2025/25 - 1521/25 = (2025 - 1521)/25 = 504/25.\n\nSo, y = \u00b1\u221a(504/25) = \u00b1(\u221a504)/5.\n\nSimplify \u221a504: 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which is not an integer. Let me factor 504: 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, no. 504 \u00f7 2 = 252; 252 \u00f7 2 = 126; 126 \u00f7 2 = 63; 63 \u00f7 3 = 21; 21 \u00f7 3 = 7. So, 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7. So, \u221a504 = \u221a(2^3 * 3^2 *7) = 2^(3/2) * 3 * \u221a7 = 2 * \u221a2 * 3 * \u221a7 = 6\u221a14.\n\nWait, let me check: 2^3 is 8, 3^2 is 9, so 8*9=72, 72*7=504. So, \u221a504 = \u221a(72*7) = \u221a72 * \u221a7 = 6\u221a2 * \u221a7 = 6\u221a14. So, y = \u00b16\u221a14/5.\n\nSo, point B is at (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). Let's take the positive y-coordinate, so B is (7.8, approx 4.4899). So, that's consistent with the Asymptote code.\n\nNow, I need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.\n\nWait, the tangent at C is easy since C is at (0,0). The tangent at C to the circumcircle \u03c9. The circumcircle passes through A(10,0), B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5), and C(0,0). To find the equation of the tangent at C, I can find the equation of the circumcircle first.\n\nLet me find the circumcircle equation. Let the general equation of a circle be x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0. Since the circle passes through A(10,0), B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5), and C(0,0).\n\nPlugging in C(0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 => F = 0.\n\nSo, the equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey = 0.\n\nPlugging in A(10,0): 100 + 0 + 10D + 0 = 0 => 10D = -100 => D = -10.\n\nSo, the equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey = 0.\n\nNow, plug in point B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5):\n\n(39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5) = 0.\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25.\n\n(6\u221a14/5)^2 = (36 * 14)/25 = (504)/25.\n\n-10*(39/5) = -78.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n1521/25 + 504/25 -78 + (6\u221a14/5)E = 0.\n\nCombine the fractions: (1521 + 504)/25 = 2025/25 = 81.\n\nSo, 81 -78 + (6\u221a14/5)E = 0 => 3 + (6\u221a14/5)E = 0 => (6\u221a14/5)E = -3 => E = (-3) * (5)/(6\u221a14) = (-15)/(6\u221a14) = (-5)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing the denominator: (-5\u221a14)/(2*14) = (-5\u221a14)/28.\n\nSo, the equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nNow, the tangent at point C(0,0). The equation of the tangent at a point (x1,y1) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0 is xx1 + yy1 + (D(x + x1))/2 + (E(y + y1))/2 + F = 0.\n\nBut since F=0, and C is (0,0), the tangent at C is 0*x + 0*y + (D(x + 0))/2 + (E(y + 0))/2 = 0 => (Dx)/2 + (Ey)/2 = 0.\n\nSubstituting D=-10, E=-5\u221a14/28:\n\n(-10 x)/2 + (-5\u221a14 y)/56 = 0 => -5x - (5\u221a14 y)/56 = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 56 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-5*56 x -5\u221a14 y = 0 => -280x -5\u221a14 y = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by -5:\n\n56x + \u221a14 y = 0.\n\nSo, the tangent at C is 56x + \u221a14 y = 0.\n\nSimilarly, find the tangent at B.\n\nThe tangent at point B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5). Using the same formula: x*(39/5) + y*(6\u221a14/5) + (D(x + 39/5))/2 + (E(y + 6\u221a14/5))/2 + F = 0.\n\nBut F=0, so:\n\n(39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y + [(-10)(x + 39/5)]/2 + [(-5\u221a14/28)(y + 6\u221a14/5)]/2 = 0.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y.\n\nSecond term: [(-10)(x + 39/5)]/2 = (-10/2)(x + 39/5) = -5(x + 39/5) = -5x - 39.\n\nThird term: [(-5\u221a14/28)(y + 6\u221a14/5)]/2 = (-5\u221a14/56)(y + 6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y -5x -39 - (5\u221a14/56)y - (5\u221a14/56)*(6\u221a14/5) = 0.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nCombine the x terms:\n\n(39/5)x -5x = (39/5 - 25/5)x = (14/5)x.\n\nCombine the y terms:\n\n(6\u221a14/5)y - (5\u221a14/56)y.\n\nLet me get a common denominator for these coefficients. 5 and 56 have LCM of 280.\n\n6\u221a14/5 = (6\u221a14 * 56)/280 = 336\u221a14/280.\n\n5\u221a14/56 = (5\u221a14 * 5)/280 = 25\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, subtracting: (336\u221a14 -25\u221a14)/280 = (311\u221a14)/280.\n\nSo, the y terms combine to (311\u221a14/280)y.\n\nNow, the constants:\n\n-39 - (5\u221a14/56)*(6\u221a14/5).\n\nCompute the second term:\n\n(5\u221a14/56)*(6\u221a14/5) = (5*6)*(\u221a14*\u221a14)/(56*5) = 30*(14)/(280) = 420/280 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the constants are -39 - 3/2 = -40.5 or -81/2.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n(14/5)x + (311\u221a14/280)y -81/2 = 0.\n\nMultiply everything by 280 to eliminate denominators:\n\n14/5 x *280 = 14 *56 x = 784x.\n\n311\u221a14/280 y *280 = 311\u221a14 y.\n\n-81/2 *280 = -81*140 = -11340.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n784x + 311\u221a14 y -11340 = 0.\n\nHmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should find the equation of the tangent at B using the point form.\n\nThe equation of the tangent to a circle at point (x1,y1) is given by:\n\n(x1 - a)(x - a) + (y1 - b)(y - b) = r\u00b2, where (a,b) is the center and r is the radius.\n\nWait, no, that's the equation of the circle itself. The tangent at (x1,y1) is:\n\n(x1)(x) + (y1)(y) + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F = 0.\n\nWait, I think I used that earlier, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the tangent using the derivative or using the fact that the tangent is perpendicular to the radius.\n\nThe center of the circle is at (D/(-2), E/(-2)) = (10/2, (5\u221a14/28)/2) = (5, 5\u221a14/56). Wait, wait, no.\n\nWait, the general equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0, so the center is at (-D/2, -E/2). So, in this case, D = -10, E = -5\u221a14/28.\n\nSo, the center is at (10/2, (5\u221a14/28)/2) = (5, 5\u221a14/56). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no. If D = -10, then the x-coordinate of the center is -D/2 = 5. Similarly, E = -5\u221a14/28, so the y-coordinate is -E/2 = (5\u221a14/28)/2 = 5\u221a14/56. So, center O is at (5, 5\u221a14/56).\n\nSo, the center is at (5, 5\u221a14/56). Now, the tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB. So, the slope of OB is (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O).\n\nPoint B is (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). So, x_B = 39/5, y_B = 6\u221a14/5.\n\nCenter O is (5, 5\u221a14/56).\n\nSo, slope of OB: (6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56) / (39/5 -5).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56 = \u221a14*(6/5 -5/56) = \u221a14*( (6*56 -5*5)/ (5*56) ) = \u221a14*( (336 -25)/280 ) = \u221a14*(311/280).\n\nDenominator:\n\n39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5 = 14/5.\n\nSo, slope of OB is (\u221a14 *311/280 ) / (14/5) ) = (\u221a14 *311/280 ) * (5/14) ) = (\u221a14 *311 *5 ) / (280 *14 ) = (\u221a14 *1555 ) / 3920.\n\nWait, maybe I can simplify this.\n\nAlternatively, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal of the slope of OB.\n\nSo, if the slope of OB is m, then the tangent's slope is -1/m.\n\nSo, let me compute m.\n\nm = (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O) = (6\u221a14/5 -5\u221a14/56) / (39/5 -5) = [ ( (6*56 -5*5)/280 )\u221a14 ] / (14/5 )\n\nCalculating numerator: 6*56 = 336, 5*5=25. 336-25=311. So, numerator is (311\u221a14)/280.\n\nDenominator: 14/5.\n\nSo, m = (311\u221a14/280) / (14/5) ) = (311\u221a14/280) * (5/14) ) = (311\u221a14 *5) / (280*14) ) = (1555\u221a14)/(3920).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator: 1555 and 3920. Let's see if they have a common factor.\n\n1555 \u00f75=311, 3920 \u00f75=784. So, 1555=5*311, 3920=5*784.\n\nSo, m = (5*311\u221a14)/(5*784) ) = 311\u221a14 /784.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the radius OB is 311\u221a14 /784.\n\nHence, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal, which is -784/(311\u221a14).\n\nSimplify this: -784/(311\u221a14). To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\n-784\u221a14 / (311 *14) = -784\u221a14 /4354.\n\nSimplify 784 and 4354: 784 \u00f714=56, 4354 \u00f714=311.\n\nSo, it becomes -56\u221a14 /311.\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent at B is -56\u221a14/311.\n\nNow, the equation of the tangent at B is y - y_B = m*(x -x_B), where m is the slope.\n\nSo, y - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5).\n\nSo, that's the equation of the tangent at B.\n\nNow, we have two tangent lines: one at C, which is 56x + \u221a14 y = 0, and the tangent at B, which is y - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5).\n\nWe need to find their intersection point D.\n\nSo, let me solve these two equations:\n\n1. 56x + \u221a14 y = 0.\n\n2. y = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me substitute equation 2 into equation 1.\n\nFrom equation 1: y = -56x /\u221a14.\n\nWait, because from equation 1: 56x + \u221a14 y =0 => y = (-56x)/\u221a14.\n\nSo, y = (-56/\u221a14) x.\n\nSimplify 56/\u221a14: 56 = 14*4, so 56/\u221a14 = (14*4)/\u221a14 = 4\u221a14.\n\nWait, because 14/\u221a14 = \u221a14. So, 56/\u221a14 = 4\u221a14.\n\nThus, y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSo, from equation 1, y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nNow, plug this into equation 2:\n\n-4\u221a14 x = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a14 to simplify:\n\n-4x = (-56/311)(x - 39/5) + 6/5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x *311 = -56(x -39/5) + (6/5)*311.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side: -1244x.\n\nRight side: -56x + (56*39)/5 + (6*311)/5.\n\nCalculate (56*39)/5: 56*39=2184, so 2184/5=436.8.\n\n(6*311)/5=1866/5=373.2.\n\nSo, right side: -56x + 436.8 + 373.2 = -56x + 810.\n\nSo, equation is:\n\n-1244x = -56x + 810.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-1244x +56x -810=0 => -1188x -810=0 => -1188x =810 => x=810/(-1188).\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 18: 810 \u00f718=45, 1188 \u00f718=66.\n\nSo, x= -45/66. Simplify further: divide numerator and denominator by 3: -15/22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nNow, substitute x into y = -4\u221a14 x:\n\ny = -4\u221a14*(-15/22) = (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, I need to find point P, which is the intersection of AD with \u03c9, other than A.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nSo, the line AD can be parametrized. Let me find the parametric equations for AD.\n\nLet me denote point A as (10,0) and point D as (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11). The vector from A to D is D - A = (-15/22 -10, 30\u221a14/11 -0) = (- (15/22 + 220/22), 30\u221a14/11) = (-235/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nSo, parametric equations for AD can be written as:\n\nx = 10 + t*(-235/22),\n\ny = 0 + t*(30\u221a14/11),\n\nwhere t varies from 0 to 1 for the segment AD, and beyond for the extended line.\n\nBut since P is another intersection point with \u03c9, we can substitute these parametric equations into the circle equation and solve for t.\n\nThe circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y =0.\n\nSubstituting x and y:\n\n[10 - (235/22)t]^2 + [ (30\u221a14/11) t ]^2 -10[10 - (235/22)t] - (5\u221a14/28)(30\u221a14/11 t ) =0.\n\nThis looks complicated, but let me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: [10 - (235/22)t]^2.\n\nLet me compute 10 as 220/22, so 220/22 -235/22 t = (220 -235t)/22.\n\nSo, squared: (220 -235t)^2 / (22)^2.\n\nSimilarly, second term: [ (30\u221a14/11) t ]^2 = (900 *14) t\u00b2 / (121) = 12600 t\u00b2 /121.\n\nThird term: -10[10 - (235/22)t] = -100 + (2350/22)t = -100 + (1175/11)t.\n\nFourth term: - (5\u221a14/28)(30\u221a14/11 t ) = - (5*30*14)/(28*11) t = - (2100)/(308) t = - (2100 \u00f728)/(308 \u00f728) t = -75/11 t.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n( (220 -235t)^2 )/(22^2) + 12600 t\u00b2/121 -100 + (1175/11)t - (75/11) t =0.\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\nFirst term: (220 -235t)^2 = 220\u00b2 - 2*220*235 t + (235t)^2 = 48400 - 103400t + 55225t\u00b2.\n\nDivided by 22\u00b2=484.\n\nSecond term: 12600t\u00b2/121.\n\nThird term: -100.\n\nFourth and fifth terms: (1175/11 -75/11)t = (1100/11)t = 100t.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n[48400 -103400t +55225t\u00b2]/484 + 12600t\u00b2/121 -100 +100t =0.\n\nMultiply each term by 484 to eliminate denominators:\n\n48400 -103400t +55225t\u00b2 + (12600t\u00b2 *4)/4 + (-100*484) +100t*484=0.\n\nWait, actually, let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: [48400 -103400t +55225t\u00b2]/484 *484 = 48400 -103400t +55225t\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: 12600t\u00b2/121 *484 =12600t\u00b2*(484/121)=12600t\u00b2*4=50400t\u00b2.\n\nThird term: -100*484= -48400.\n\nFourth term: 100t*484=48400t.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n48400 -103400t +55225t\u00b2 +50400t\u00b2 -48400 +48400t =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n48400 -48400 cancels out.\n\n-103400t +48400t = (-103400 +48400)t = (-55000)t.\n\n55225t\u00b2 +50400t\u00b2=105625t\u00b2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n105625t\u00b2 -55000t =0.\n\nFactor out t:\n\nt*(105625t -55000)=0.\n\nSo, solutions are t=0 and t=55000/105625.\n\nSimplify 55000/105625:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25: 2200/4225.\n\nAgain, divide by 5: 440/845.\n\nAgain, divide by 5: 88/169.\n\nSo, t=88/169.\n\nTherefore, the points of intersection are t=0 (which is point A) and t=88/169 (which is point P).\n\nSo, the coordinates of P are:\n\nx =10 - (235/22)*(88/169),\n\ny=0 + (30\u221a14/11)*(88/169).\n\nCompute x:\n\nFirst, 235/22 *88/169: 88/22=4, so 235*4=940. 940/169.\n\nSo, x=10 -940/169.\n\n10 is 1690/169, so 1690/169 -940/169=750/169.\n\nSimilarly, y:\n\n30\u221a14/11 *88/169.\n\n88/11=8, so 30*8=240. So, 240\u221a14 /169.\n\nSo, point P is at (750/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nNow, I need to find the length AP.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), which is (1690/169, 0). Point P is at (750/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nSo, the vector from A to P is (750/169 -1690/169, 240\u221a14/169 -0) = (-940/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nSo, the distance AP is sqrt[ (-940/169)^2 + (240\u221a14/169)^2 ].\n\nCompute each component:\n\n(-940/169)^2 = (940^2)/(169^2).\n\n(240\u221a14/169)^2 = (240^2 *14)/(169^2).\n\nSo, AP^2 = [940\u00b2 +240\u00b2 *14]/(169\u00b2).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n940\u00b2: 940*940. Let me compute 900\u00b2=810000, 40\u00b2=1600, and 2*900*40=72000. So, (900+40)^2=900\u00b2 +2*900*40 +40\u00b2=810000 +72000 +1600=883600.\n\n240\u00b2=57600. 57600*14=806400.\n\nSo, numerator=883600 +806400=1,690,000.\n\nTherefore, AP^2=1,690,000/(169)^2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n1,690,000=169*10,000.\n\nSo, AP^2= (169*10,000)/(169^2)=10,000/169.\n\nTherefore, AP=\u221a(10,000/169)=100/13.\n\nSo, AP=100/13. Therefore, m=100, n=13, and m +n=113.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents at B and C meet at D, and AD intersects \u03c9 again at P. The sides are given: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. I need to express AP as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle \u03c9 is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. So, D is the ex-pole of BC? Or maybe it's the ex-pole related to some other point. Hmm, I'm not sure about that terminology. But tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length, so BD = CD. That might come in handy.\n\nAD intersects \u03c9 again at P. So, AD is a secant of the circle, passing through A and D, and intersecting the circle at A and P. So, by the Power of a Point theorem, the power of point D with respect to \u03c9 should be equal to DB\u00b2 (since DB is the tangent from D to \u03c9). Also, the power of D is equal to DP * DA. Wait, no, actually, the power is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2, and since AD is a secant, the power is also DP * DA. But wait, AD is from D to A, which is outside the circle, so the power should be DB\u00b2 = DP * DA. Wait, actually, the Power of a Point says that for a point outside the circle, the power is equal to the square of the tangent length, which is DB\u00b2, and also equal to the product of the lengths from the point to the intersection points of any secant. So, yes, DB\u00b2 = DP * DA.\n\nWait, but in the problem, AD intersects \u03c9 at P. So, the entire length from D to P is DP, and from D to A is DA. So, if I let DA = x, then DP = x - AP, but wait, no. Wait, AP is the segment from A to P, so if DA is the entire length from D to A, then DP would be DA - AP? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, if you have point D, then the line DA goes through A and then to P on the circle. So, the order is D, then A, then P. So, DA is the segment from D to A, and DP is from D to P, which is longer than DA. So, DP = DA + AP. Wait, but that can't be because P is on the circle, which is on the other side from D. Wait, maybe I have the order wrong. Maybe it's D, then P, then A? Because the tangent points are at B and C, so D is outside the circle, and AD is a secant that starts at D, goes through the circle at P, and then exits at A. Wait, that makes more sense because A is on the circle, so AD is a secant that starts outside the circle at D, enters at P, and then exits at A. So, the points are D---P---A. Therefore, DP * DA = DB\u00b2, but wait, no. Wait, the Power of a Point theorem states that for a point D outside the circle, the power is equal to the product of the lengths from D to the two intersection points of any secant line through D. So, if the secant intersects the circle at P and A, then the power is DP * DA. But wait, the power is also equal to DB\u00b2, since DB is the tangent. So, DB\u00b2 = DP * DA.\n\nWait, no, the order is important. If the points are D---P---A, then the lengths are DP (from D to P) and DA (from D to A). But DA is longer than DP because A is further from D than P is. So, actually, the correct formula is DB\u00b2 = DP * DA. But wait, that would be if the secant is DP and PA, but no, the two segments from D are DP and DA, but DA is beyond P. So, in Power of a Point, it's DP * DA, but since A is beyond P, the correct formula is DP * DA = DB\u00b2. Wait, but that would imply that DA is from D to A, passing through P, so DA is longer than DP. So, actually, DA = DP + PA. So, if I let DA = x, then DP = x - PA. But I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write it as DP * DA = DB\u00b2. But if the points are D, P, A, then DA is the entire length from D to A, which is DP + PA. So, the Power of a Point formula is DP * DA = DB\u00b2. So, DP * (DP + PA) = DB\u00b2. But I don't know DP or PA yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use coordinate geometry. But that might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe use inversion or some other methods, but perhaps using similar triangles or harmonic division.\n\nWait, another approach: Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the ex-similicenter of the circumcircle. Maybe I can use properties related to poles and polars, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute the coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry.\n\nLet me place the triangle in the coordinate plane. Let me set point C at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, point A is at (10, 0), because AC is 10 units. Point B is somewhere in the plane. Given that AB is 5 and BC is 9, I can find the coordinates of B.\n\nSo, points: C(0,0), A(10,0). Let me denote point B as (x,y). Then, the distance from B to C is 9: \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 9, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 81.\n\nThe distance from B to A is 5: \u221a((x - 10)\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 5, so (x - 10)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 25.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second: (x - 10)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 25 - 81 => x\u00b2 -20x + 100 + y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -56 => -20x + 100 = -56 => -20x = -156 => x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.\n\nSo, x = 7.8, which is 39/5. Then, plug into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 81: (39/5)^2 + y\u00b2 = 81.\n\nCalculating (39/5)^2: 39^2 = 1521, so 1521/25 + y\u00b2 = 81.\n\nConvert 81 to 25ths: 81 = 2025/25.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 2025/25 - 1521/25 = (2025 - 1521)/25 = 504/25.\n\nSo, y = \u00b1\u221a(504/25) = \u00b1(\u221a504)/5.\n\nSimplify \u221a504: 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which is not an integer. Let me factor 504: 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, no. 504 \u00f7 2 = 252; 252 \u00f7 2 = 126; 126 \u00f7 2 = 63; 63 \u00f7 3 = 21; 21 \u00f7 3 = 7. So, 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7. So, \u221a504 = \u221a(2^3 * 3^2 *7) = 2^(3/2) * 3 * \u221a7 = 2 * \u221a2 * 3 * \u221a7 = 6\u221a14.\n\nWait, let me check: 2^3 is 8, 3^2 is 9, so 8*9=72, 72*7=504. So, \u221a504 = \u221a(72*7) = \u221a72 * \u221a7 = 6\u221a2 * \u221a7 = 6\u221a14. So, y = \u00b16\u221a14/5.\n\nSo, point B is at (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). Let's take the positive y-coordinate, so B is (7.8, approx 4.4899). So, that's consistent with the Asymptote code.\n\nNow, I need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.\n\nWait, the tangent at C is easy since C is at (0,0). The tangent at C to the circumcircle \u03c9. The circumcircle passes through A(10,0), B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5), and C(0,0). To find the equation of the tangent at C, I can find the equation of the circumcircle first.\n\nLet me find the circumcircle equation. Let the general equation of a circle be x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0. Since the circle passes through A(10,0), B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5), and C(0,0).\n\nPlugging in C(0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 => F = 0.\n\nSo, the equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey = 0.\n\nPlugging in A(10,0): 100 + 0 + 10D + 0 = 0 => 10D = -100 => D = -10.\n\nSo, the equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey = 0.\n\nNow, plug in point B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5):\n\n(39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5) = 0.\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25.\n\n(6\u221a14/5)^2 = (36 * 14)/25 = (504)/25.\n\n-10*(39/5) = -78.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n1521/25 + 504/25 -78 + (6\u221a14/5)E = 0.\n\nCombine the fractions: (1521 + 504)/25 = 2025/25 = 81.\n\nSo, 81 -78 + (6\u221a14/5)E = 0 => 3 + (6\u221a14/5)E = 0 => (6\u221a14/5)E = -3 => E = (-3) * (5)/(6\u221a14) = (-15)/(6\u221a14) = (-5)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing the denominator: (-5\u221a14)/(2*14) = (-5\u221a14)/28.\n\nSo, the equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nNow, the tangent at point C(0,0). The equation of the tangent at a point (x1,y1) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0 is xx1 + yy1 + (D(x + x1))/2 + (E(y + y1))/2 + F = 0.\n\nBut since F=0, and C is (0,0), the tangent at C is 0*x + 0*y + (D(x + 0))/2 + (E(y + 0))/2 = 0 => (Dx)/2 + (Ey)/2 = 0.\n\nSubstituting D=-10, E=-5\u221a14/28:\n\n(-10 x)/2 + (-5\u221a14 y)/56 = 0 => -5x - (5\u221a14 y)/56 = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 56 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-5*56 x -5\u221a14 y = 0 => -280x -5\u221a14 y = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by -5:\n\n56x + \u221a14 y = 0.\n\nSo, the tangent at C is 56x + \u221a14 y = 0.\n\nSimilarly, find the tangent at B.\n\nThe tangent at point B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5). Using the same formula: x*(39/5) + y*(6\u221a14/5) + (D(x + 39/5))/2 + (E(y + 6\u221a14/5))/2 + F = 0.\n\nBut F=0, so:\n\n(39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y + [(-10)(x + 39/5)]/2 + [(-5\u221a14/28)(y + 6\u221a14/5)]/2 = 0.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y.\n\nSecond term: [(-10)(x + 39/5)]/2 = (-10/2)(x + 39/5) = -5(x + 39/5) = -5x - 39.\n\nThird term: [(-5\u221a14/28)(y + 6\u221a14/5)]/2 = (-5\u221a14/56)(y + 6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y -5x -39 - (5\u221a14/56)y - (5\u221a14/56)*(6\u221a14/5) = 0.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nCombine the x terms:\n\n(39/5)x -5x = (39/5 - 25/5)x = (14/5)x.\n\nCombine the y terms:\n\n(6\u221a14/5)y - (5\u221a14/56)y.\n\nLet me get a common denominator for these coefficients. 5 and 56 have LCM of 280.\n\n6\u221a14/5 = (6\u221a14 * 56)/280 = 336\u221a14/280.\n\n5\u221a14/56 = (5\u221a14 * 5)/280 = 25\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, subtracting: (336\u221a14 -25\u221a14)/280 = (311\u221a14)/280.\n\nSo, the y terms combine to (311\u221a14/280)y.\n\nNow, the constants:\n\n-39 - (5\u221a14/56)*(6\u221a14/5).\n\nCompute the second term:\n\n(5\u221a14/56)*(6\u221a14/5) = (5*6)*(\u221a14*\u221a14)/(56*5) = 30*(14)/(280) = 420/280 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the constants are -39 - 3/2 = -40.5 or -81/2.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n(14/5)x + (311\u221a14/280)y -81/2 = 0.\n\nMultiply everything by 280 to eliminate denominators:\n\n14/5 x *280 = 14 *56 x = 784x.\n\n311\u221a14/280 y *280 = 311\u221a14 y.\n\n-81/2 *280 = -81*140 = -11340.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n784x + 311\u221a14 y -11340 = 0.\n\nHmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should find the equation of the tangent at B using the point form.\n\nThe equation of the tangent to a circle at point (x1,y1) is given by:\n\n(x1 - a)(x - a) + (y1 - b)(y - b) = r\u00b2, where (a,b) is the center and r is the radius.\n\nWait, no, that's the equation of the circle itself. The tangent at (x1,y1) is:\n\n(x1)(x) + (y1)(y) + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F = 0.\n\nWait, I think I used that earlier, but maybe I should double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the tangent using the derivative or using the fact that the tangent is perpendicular to the radius.\n\nThe center of the circle is at (D/(-2), E/(-2)) = (10/2, (5\u221a14/28)/2) = (5, 5\u221a14/56). Wait, wait, no.\n\nWait, the general equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0, so the center is at (-D/2, -E/2). So, in this case, D = -10, E = -5\u221a14/28.\n\nSo, the center is at (10/2, (5\u221a14/28)/2) = (5, 5\u221a14/56). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no. If D = -10, then the x-coordinate of the center is -D/2 = 5. Similarly, E = -5\u221a14/28, so the y-coordinate is -E/2 = (5\u221a14/28)/2 = 5\u221a14/56. So, center O is at (5, 5\u221a14/56).\n\nSo, the center is at (5, 5\u221a14/56). Now, the tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB. So, the slope of OB is (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O).\n\nPoint B is (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). So, x_B = 39/5, y_B = 6\u221a14/5.\n\nCenter O is (5, 5\u221a14/56).\n\nSo, slope of OB: (6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56) / (39/5 -5).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n6\u221a14/5 - 5\u221a14/56 = \u221a14*(6/5 -5/56) = \u221a14*( (6*56 -5*5)/ (5*56) ) = \u221a14*( (336 -25)/280 ) = \u221a14*(311/280).\n\nDenominator:\n\n39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5 = 14/5.\n\nSo, slope of OB is (\u221a14 *311/280 ) / (14/5) ) = (\u221a14 *311/280 ) * (5/14) ) = (\u221a14 *311 *5 ) / (280 *14 ) = (\u221a14 *1555 ) / 3920.\n\nWait, maybe I can simplify this.\n\nAlternatively, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal of the slope of OB.\n\nSo, if the slope of OB is m, then the tangent's slope is -1/m.\n\nSo, let me compute m.\n\nm = (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O) = (6\u221a14/5 -5\u221a14/56) / (39/5 -5) = [ ( (6*56 -5*5)/280 )\u221a14 ] / (14/5 )\n\nCalculating numerator: 6*56 = 336, 5*5=25. 336-25=311. So, numerator is (311\u221a14)/280.\n\nDenominator: 14/5.\n\nSo, m = (311\u221a14/280) / (14/5) ) = (311\u221a14/280) * (5/14) ) = (311\u221a14 *5) / (280*14) ) = (1555\u221a14)/(3920).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator: 1555 and 3920. Let's see if they have a common factor.\n\n1555 \u00f75=311, 3920 \u00f75=784. So, 1555=5*311, 3920=5*784.\n\nSo, m = (5*311\u221a14)/(5*784) ) = 311\u221a14 /784.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the radius OB is 311\u221a14 /784.\n\nHence, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal, which is -784/(311\u221a14).\n\nSimplify this: -784/(311\u221a14). To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\n-784\u221a14 / (311 *14) = -784\u221a14 /4354.\n\nSimplify 784 and 4354: 784 \u00f714=56, 4354 \u00f714=311.\n\nSo, it becomes -56\u221a14 /311.\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent at B is -56\u221a14/311.\n\nNow, the equation of the tangent at B is y - y_B = m*(x -x_B), where m is the slope.\n\nSo, y - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5).\n\nSo, that's the equation of the tangent at B.\n\nNow, we have two tangent lines: one at C, which is 56x + \u221a14 y = 0, and the tangent at B, which is y - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5).\n\nWe need to find their intersection point D.\n\nSo, let me solve these two equations:\n\n1. 56x + \u221a14 y = 0.\n\n2. y = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me substitute equation 2 into equation 1.\n\nFrom equation 1: y = -56x /\u221a14.\n\nWait, because from equation 1: 56x + \u221a14 y =0 => y = (-56x)/\u221a14.\n\nSo, y = (-56/\u221a14) x.\n\nSimplify 56/\u221a14: 56 = 14*4, so 56/\u221a14 = (14*4)/\u221a14 = 4\u221a14.\n\nWait, because 14/\u221a14 = \u221a14. So, 56/\u221a14 = 4\u221a14.\n\nThus, y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSo, from equation 1, y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nNow, plug this into equation 2:\n\n-4\u221a14 x = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5) + 6\u221a14/5.\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a14 to simplify:\n\n-4x = (-56/311)(x - 39/5) + 6/5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x *311 = -56(x -39/5) + (6/5)*311.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side: -1244x.\n\nRight side: -56x + (56*39)/5 + (6*311)/5.\n\nCalculate (56*39)/5: 56*39=2184, so 2184/5=436.8.\n\n(6*311)/5=1866/5=373.2.\n\nSo, right side: -56x + 436.8 + 373.2 = -56x + 810.\n\nSo, equation is:\n\n-1244x = -56x + 810.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-1244x +56x -810=0 => -1188x -810=0 => -1188x =810 => x=810/(-1188).\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 18: 810 \u00f718=45, 1188 \u00f718=66.\n\nSo, x= -45/66. Simplify further: divide numerator and denominator by 3: -15/22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nNow, substitute x into y = -4\u221a14 x:\n\ny = -4\u221a14*(-15/22) = (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, I need to find point P, which is the intersection of AD with \u03c9, other than A.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nSo, the line AD can be parametrized. Let me find the parametric equations for AD.\n\nLet me denote point A as (10,0) and point D as (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11). The vector from A to D is D - A = (-15/22 -10, 30\u221a14/11 -0) = (- (15/22 + 220/22), 30\u221a14/11) = (-235/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nSo, parametric equations for AD can be written as:\n\nx = 10 + t*(-235/22),\n\ny = 0 + t*(30\u221a14/11),\n\nwhere t varies from 0 to 1 for the segment AD, and beyond for the extended line.\n\nBut since P is another intersection point with \u03c9, we can substitute these parametric equations into the circle equation and solve for t.\n\nThe circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)y =0.\n\nSubstituting x and y:\n\n[10 - (235/22)t]^2 + [ (30\u221a14/11) t ]^2 -10[10 - (235/22)t] - (5\u221a14/28)(30\u221a14/11 t ) =0.\n\nThis looks complicated, but let me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: [10 - (235/22)t]^2.\n\nLet me compute 10 as 220/22, so 220/22 -235/22 t = (220 -235t)/22.\n\nSo, squared: (220 -235t)^2 / (22)^2.\n\nSimilarly, second term: [ (30\u221a14/11) t ]^2 = (900 *14) t\u00b2 / (121) = 12600 t\u00b2 /121.\n\nThird term: -10[10 - (235/22)t] = -100 + (2350/22)t = -100 + (1175/11)t.\n\nFourth term: - (5\u221a14/28)(30\u221a14/11 t ) = - (5*30*14)/(28*11) t = - (2100)/(308) t = - (2100 \u00f728)/(308 \u00f728) t = -75/11 t.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n( (220 -235t)^2 )/(22^2) + 12600 t\u00b2/121 -100 + (1175/11)t - (75/11) t =0.\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\nFirst term: (220 -235t)^2 = 220\u00b2 - 2*220*235 t + (235t)^2 = 48400 - 103400t + 55225t\u00b2.\n\nDivided by 22\u00b2=484.\n\nSecond term: 12600t\u00b2/121.\n\nThird term: -100.\n\nFourth and fifth terms: (1175/11 -75/11)t = (1100/11)t = 100t.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n[48400 -103400t +55225t\u00b2]/484 + 12600t\u00b2/121 -100 +100t =0.\n\nMultiply each term by 484 to eliminate denominators:\n\n48400 -103400t +55225t\u00b2 + (12600t\u00b2 *4)/4 + (-100*484) +100t*484=0.\n\nWait, actually, let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: [48400 -103400t +55225t\u00b2]/484 *484 = 48400 -103400t +55225t\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: 12600t\u00b2/121 *484 =12600t\u00b2*(484/121)=12600t\u00b2*4=50400t\u00b2.\n\nThird term: -100*484= -48400.\n\nFourth term: 100t*484=48400t.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n48400 -103400t +55225t\u00b2 +50400t\u00b2 -48400 +48400t =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n48400 -48400 cancels out.\n\n-103400t +48400t = (-103400 +48400)t = (-55000)t.\n\n55225t\u00b2 +50400t\u00b2=105625t\u00b2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n105625t\u00b2 -55000t =0.\n\nFactor out t:\n\nt*(105625t -55000)=0.\n\nSo, solutions are t=0 and t=55000/105625.\n\nSimplify 55000/105625:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25: 2200/4225.\n\nAgain, divide by 5: 440/845.\n\nAgain, divide by 5: 88/169.\n\nSo, t=88/169.\n\nTherefore, the points of intersection are t=0 (which is point A) and t=88/169 (which is point P).\n\nSo, the coordinates of P are:\n\nx =10 - (235/22)*(88/169),\n\ny=0 + (30\u221a14/11)*(88/169).\n\nCompute x:\n\nFirst, 235/22 *88/169: 88/22=4, so 235*4=940. 940/169.\n\nSo, x=10 -940/169.\n\n10 is 1690/169, so 1690/169 -940/169=750/169.\n\nSimilarly, y:\n\n30\u221a14/11 *88/169.\n\n88/11=8, so 30*8=240. So, 240\u221a14 /169.\n\nSo, point P is at (750/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nNow, I need to find the length AP.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), which is (1690/169, 0). Point P is at (750/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nSo, the vector from A to P is (750/169 -1690/169, 240\u221a14/169 -0) = (-940/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nSo, the distance AP is sqrt[ (-940/169)^2 + (240\u221a14/169)^2 ].\n\nCompute each component:\n\n(-940/169)^2 = (940^2)/(169^2).\n\n(240\u221a14/169)^2 = (240^2 *14)/(169^2).\n\nSo, AP^2 = [940\u00b2 +240\u00b2 *14]/(169\u00b2).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n940\u00b2: 940*940. Let me compute 900\u00b2=810000, 40\u00b2=1600, and 2*900*40=72000. So, (900+40)^2=900\u00b2 +2*900*40 +40\u00b2=810000 +72000 +1600=883600.\n\n240\u00b2=57600. 57600*14=806400.\n\nSo, numerator=883600 +806400=1,690,000.\n\nTherefore, AP^2=1,690,000/(169)^2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n1,690,000=169*10,000.\n\nSo, AP^2= (169*10,000)/(169^2)=10,000/169.\n\nTherefore, AP=\u221a(10,000/169)=100/13.\n\nSo, AP=100/13. Therefore, m=100, n=13, and m +n=113.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that triangle \\(ABC\\) has sides \\(AB = 5\\), \\(BC = 9\\), and \\(AC = 10\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem is about triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then AD intersects \u03c9 again at P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nFirst, I'll try to visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle \u03c9 is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D, so D is the exsimilicenter or the external homothety center of the two tangents. Then, connecting A to D, the line AD intersects the circle \u03c9 again at point P. We need to find the length AP.\n\nI remember that when dealing with tangents to a circle, the lengths from the external point to the points of tangency are equal. So, for point D, the lengths DB and DC should be equal because they are both tangents from D to \u03c9. That means triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.\n\nNow, how can I relate this to point P? Since AD intersects \u03c9 again at P, perhaps there's a power of a point theorem involved here. The power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DP * DA. Wait, let me think. The power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to the square of the tangent from D to \u03c9, which is DB (or DC). So, power of D: DB\u00b2 = DP * DA.\n\nSo, if I can find DB, I can express DP in terms of DA. Then, AP would be DA - DP, or DP = DA - AP. Wait, no, AP is the segment from A to P, so actually, DA is the entire length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So, AP would be DA - DP? Hmm, not exactly. Because A is outside the circle, and P is the second intersection point. Wait, no. A is on the circle, so DA is a secant that starts at D, goes through A, and then intersects the circle again at P. So, the power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is DP * DA = DB\u00b2. So, DP * DA = DB\u00b2. So, if I can find DB and DA, I can find DP, then AP would be DA - DP, since AP is from A to P, and DP is from D to P, so AP = DA - DP.\n\nBut wait, actually, DA is from D to A, and AP is from A to P, so DP is from D to P, which is DA + AP? No, that can't be. Because D is outside the circle, and A is on the circle, so the line DA passes through A and then P is on the other side. So, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So, DP = DA + AP? Hmm, no. Wait, the points are D, then A, then P along the line. So, DA is the distance from D to A, and AP is from A to P, so DP = DA + AP. But that would mean that the power of D is DP * DA = DB\u00b2. Wait, no, the power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is DP * DA = DB\u00b2. So, if DP is the entire length from D to P, and DA is from D to A, then DP * DA = DB\u00b2. So, DP = DA + AP, so (DA + AP) * DA = DB\u00b2. That gives us an equation: DA\u00b2 + DA * AP = DB\u00b2.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to approach this. Perhaps using harmonic division or something related to poles and polars. Alternatively, maybe using inversion, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since ABC is a triangle with known side lengths, perhaps we can compute its circumradius, then find coordinates or use coordinate geometry to find point D and then find AP.\n\nLet me first compute the circumradius of triangle ABC. The formula for the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where a, b, c are the sides, and \u0394 is the area.\n\nGiven sides: AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, a=5, b=9, c=10? Wait, actually, in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. So, a=9, b=10, c=5.\n\nWait, no, let me confirm: in triangle ABC, side a is opposite vertex A, which is BC. So, a = BC = 9, side b is AC =10, side c is AB=5.\n\nFirst, let's compute the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (9 + 10 +5)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.\n\nThen, the area \u0394 can be found using Heron's formula: sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)].\n\nSo, \u0394 = sqrt[12*(12-9)*(12-10)*(12-5)] = sqrt[12*3*2*7] = sqrt[12*42] = sqrt[504].\n\nSimplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, no, 504 = 16 * 31.5 is incorrect. Let's factor 504: 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which isn't an integer. Let me do prime factors.\n\n504: 504 / 2 = 252; 252 / 2 = 126; 126 / 2 = 63; 63 / 3 = 21; 21 /3=7. So, 2^3 * 3^2 *7. So, sqrt(504)=sqrt(2^3*3^2*7)= 2^(1.5)*3*sqrt(7)= 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7)= 6*sqrt(14). So, \u0394=6*sqrt(14).\n\nThen, the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4\u0394) = (9*10*5)/(4*6*sqrt(14)) = (450)/(24*sqrt(14)) = (75)/(4*sqrt(14)).\n\nWe can rationalize the denominator: (75)/(4*sqrt(14)) = (75*sqrt(14))/(4*14) = (75*sqrt(14))/56. So, R = 75\u221a14 /56.\n\nHmm, okay, so R is known. But how does that help us? Well, perhaps knowing R can help in coordinate geometry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry to model the triangle and compute the required lengths.\n\nLet me try setting up coordinates. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0). Then, since AC=10, and AB=5, BC=9. So, point A is somewhere, point B is somewhere.\n\nWait, if I set C at (0,0), then point A is somewhere on the x-axis at (10,0), since AC=10. Then, point B is somewhere in the plane. Let's find the coordinates of B.\n\nSo, points: C=(0,0), A=(10,0). We need to find point B such that AB=5, BC=9.\n\nSo, the distance from A to B is 5: sqrt[(x-10)^2 + y^2] =5.\n\nThe distance from B to C is 9: sqrt[x^2 + y^2] =9.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. (x)^2 + y^2 = 81.\n\n2. (x-10)^2 + y^2 =25.\n\nSubtracting equation 2 from equation 1:\n\nx^2 + y^2 - [(x-10)^2 + y^2] =81 -25=56.\n\nExpanding (x-10)^2: x^2 -20x +100.\n\nSo, x^2 + y^2 - (x^2 -20x +100 + y^2) =56.\n\nSimplify: x^2 + y^2 -x^2 +20x -100 -y^2 =56.\n\nSo, 20x -100 =56.\n\n20x=156 \u2192 x=156/20=7.8.\n\nSo, x=7.8, which is 39/5. Then, plugging back into equation 1 to find y.\n\nx=39/5, so x\u00b2= (39/5)^2=1521/25.\n\nSo, 1521/25 + y\u00b2=81.\n\n81 is 2025/25.\n\nSo, y\u00b2=2025/25 -1521/25= (2025-1521)/25=504/25.\n\nThus, y= sqrt(504)/5= (6*sqrt(14))/5.\n\nSo, point B is at (7.8, (6\u221a14)/5) which is (39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo, coordinates:\n\nA=(10,0), B=(39/5, 6\u221a14/5), C=(0,0).\n\nNow, we can find the circumcircle \u03c9. Since points A, B, C are known, we can compute the circumcircle's equation.\n\nAlternatively, since we know the circumradius R=75\u221a14/56, and the circumcenter O. Let's compute O's coordinates.\n\nWait, the circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides.\n\nLet's compute the perpendicular bisector of AC and BC.\n\nBut wait, AC is from (10,0) to (0,0), so its midpoint is (5,0). The perpendicular bisector is the line perpendicular to AC (which is along the x-axis) at (5,0). So, the perpendicular bisector is the line x=5.\n\nNow, find the perpendicular bisector of BC. Point B is (39/5,6\u221a14/5), point C is (0,0). The midpoint of BC is ((39/5)/2, (6\u221a14/5)/2) = (39/10, 3\u221a14/5).\n\nThe slope of BC is (6\u221a14/5 -0)/(39/5 -0)= (6\u221a14/5)/(39/5)=6\u221a14/39= 2\u221a14/13.\n\nSo, the slope of BC is 2\u221a14/13, so the perpendicular bisector will have slope -13/(2\u221a14).\n\nSo, the equation of the perpendicular bisector of BC is y - 3\u221a14/5 = (-13/(2\u221a14))(x - 39/10).\n\nNow, the circumcenter O lies at the intersection of x=5 and this line.\n\nSubstitute x=5 into the equation:\n\ny - 3\u221a14/5 = (-13/(2\u221a14))(5 - 39/10).\n\nCompute 5 -39/10 = (50/10 -39/10)=11/10.\n\nSo, y - 3\u221a14/5 = (-13/(2\u221a14))*(11/10) = (-143)/(20\u221a14).\n\nSo, y= 3\u221a14/5 -143/(20\u221a14).\n\nLet me rationalize the second term:\n\n143/(20\u221a14) = (143\u221a14)/(20*14)= (143\u221a14)/280.\n\nSo, y= (3\u221a14)/5 - (143\u221a14)/280.\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 280.\n\n(3\u221a14)/5 = (3\u221a14 *56)/280=168\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, y= 168\u221a14/280 -143\u221a14/280 = (168-143)\u221a14/280=25\u221a14/280=5\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, the circumcenter O is at (5,5\u221a14/56).\n\nWait, that seems a bit small, but okay.\n\nSo, O=(5,5\u221a14/56).\n\nNow, with O known, we can find the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = R^2. Here, h=5, k=5\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, equation: (x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nLet me compute R^2:\n\n(75\u221a14/56)^2 = (75^2 *14)/(56^2)= (5625*14)/(3136)=78750/3136.\n\nSimplify 78750/3136: Let's divide numerator and denominator by 2: 39375/1568. Hmm, maybe not necessary right now.\n\nSo, equation of \u03c9 is (x-5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 =78750/3136.\n\nNow, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.\n\nWait, the tangent at B and tangent at C intersect at D.\n\nIn coordinate geometry, the equation of the tangent to a circle at a point (x1,y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R^2, but wait, no. The equation of the tangent line at (x1, y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R^2? Wait, no, that's the equation of the circle.\n\nWait, the tangent line at (x1,y1) on the circle with center (h,k) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R^2. No, that's not correct. Wait, actually, the equation of the tangent line is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = (x1 - h)^2 + (y1 - k)^2. But since (x1,y1) is on the circle, (x1 - h)^2 + (y1 - k)^2 = R^2, so the equation simplifies to (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R^2.\n\nAlternatively, another formula is that the tangent line at (x1,y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R^2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the point form of the tangent.\n\nAlternatively, for a circle with center (h,k), the equation of the tangent at point (x1,y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R^2.\n\nBut let me verify this with a simple case. For example, the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = R\u00b2, the tangent at (x1,y1) is xx1 + yy1 = R\u00b2. So, yes, in that case, (x1 - 0)(x - 0) + (y1 - 0)(y - 0) = R\u00b2, which is correct.\n\nSo, yes, in general, for a circle with center (h,k), the tangent at (x1,y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at B is (xB -5)(x -5) + (yB -5\u221a14/56)(y -5\u221a14/56) = R\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at C is (xC -5)(x -5) + (yC -5\u221a14/56)(y -5\u221a14/56) = R\u00b2.\n\nBut point C is (0,0), so tangent at C is (0 -5)(x -5) + (0 -5\u221a14/56)(y -5\u221a14/56) = R\u00b2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-5)(x -5) + (-5\u221a14/56)(y -5\u221a14/56) = R\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, tangent at B: (xB -5)(x -5) + (yB -5\u221a14/56)(y -5\u221a14/56) = R\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute these equations step by step.\n\nFirst, tangent at C: (-5)(x -5) + (-5\u221a14/56)(y -5\u221a14/56) = R\u00b2.\n\nCompute left side:\n\n-5x +25 - (5\u221a14/56)y + (5\u221a14/56)*(5\u221a14/56) = R\u00b2.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n-5x +25 - (5\u221a14/56)y + (25*14)/(56^2) = R\u00b2.\n\nCompute 25*14=350, and 56^2=3136.\n\nSo, 350/3136= 175/1568.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n-5x +25 - (5\u221a14/56)y +175/1568 = R\u00b2.\n\nBut R\u00b2=78750/3136, which is approximately 25.125.\n\nWait, let's compute 78750/3136:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 14: 78750/14=5625, 3136/14=224.\n\nSo, 5625/224 \u224825.125.\n\nSo, R\u00b2=5625/224.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n-5x +25 - (5\u221a14/56)y +175/1568 =5625/224.\n\nLet me convert all terms to have denominator 1568 for easy addition.\n\n25 is 25*1568/1568=39200/1568.\n\n175/1568 is already over 1568.\n\n5625/224= (5625*7)/1568=39375/1568.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n-5x - (5\u221a14/56)y +39200/1568 +175/1568 =39375/1568.\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n39200 +175=39375.\n\nSo, -5x - (5\u221a14/56)y +39375/1568 =39375/1568.\n\nSubtract 39375/1568 from both sides:\n\n-5x - (5\u221a14/56)y =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n5x + (5\u221a14/56)y =0.\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nx + (\u221a14/56)y =0.\n\nSo, the tangent at C is x + (\u221a14/56)y =0.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, original equation after expanding:\n\n-5x +25 - (5\u221a14/56)y +175/1568 =5625/224.\n\nBut 5625/224 is equal to 5625/(32*7)=5625/224\u224825.125.\n\nBut 25 is 25, and 175/1568\u22480.1115.\n\nSo, 25 + 0.1115\u224825.1115, which is approximately 5625/224\u224825.125. Hmm, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, moving all terms to left:\n\n-5x +25 - (5\u221a14/56)y +175/1568 -5625/224=0.\n\nBut I think my earlier approach was correct, but perhaps there was an error in the signs.\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nThe equation is:\n\n-5x +25 - (5\u221a14/56)y +175/1568 =5625/224.\n\nSubtract 5625/224 from both sides:\n\n-5x +25 - (5\u221a14/56)y +175/1568 -5625/224=0.\n\nConvert all terms to denominator 1568.\n\n25=25*1568/1568=39200/1568.\n\n175/1568 is as is.\n\n5625/224=5625*7/1568=39375/1568.\n\nSo,\n\n-5x - (5\u221a14/56)y +39200/1568 +175/1568 -39375/1568=0.\n\nCombine constants:\n\n39200 +175=39375; 39375 -39375=0.\n\nSo, the equation reduces to:\n\n-5x - (5\u221a14/56)y=0.\n\nWhich simplifies to 5x + (5\u221a14/56)y=0, then dividing by 5:\n\nx + (\u221a14/56)y=0.\n\nSo, the tangent at C is x + (\u221a14/56)y=0.\n\nSimilarly, let's find the tangent at B.\n\nPoint B is (39/5,6\u221a14/5). So, the tangent at B is:\n\n(xB -5)(x -5) + (yB -5\u221a14/56)(y -5\u221a14/56)=R\u00b2.\n\nCompute each part:\n\nxB -5=39/5 -25/5=14/5.\n\nyB -5\u221a14/56=6\u221a14/5 -5\u221a14/56= (6\u221a14*56 -5\u221a14*5)/(5*56)= (336\u221a14 -25\u221a14)/280= 311\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, the tangent equation is:\n\n(14/5)(x -5) + (311\u221a14/280)(y -5\u221a14/56)=5625/224.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n14/5 *x -14/5 *5 + (311\u221a14/280)y - (311\u221a14/280)*(5\u221a14/56)=5625/224.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n14/5 x -14 + (311\u221a14/280)y - [ (311\u221a14 *5\u221a14 )/(280*56) ].\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 14/5 x.\n\nSecond term: -14.\n\nThird term: 311\u221a14/280 y.\n\nFourth term: numerator is 311 *5 *14=311*70=21770. Denominator:280*56=15680.\n\nSo, the fourth term is 21770/15680.\n\nSimplify 21770/15680: divide numerator and denominator by 10: 2177/1568.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n14/5 x -14 + 311\u221a14/280 y -2177/1568 =5625/224.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n14/5 x +311\u221a14/280 y -14 -2177/1568 -5625/224=0.\n\nConvert all constants to denominator 1568.\n\n-14= -14*1568/1568= -21952/1568.\n\n-2177/1568 is as is.\n\n-5625/224= -5625*7/1568= -39375/1568.\n\nSo, combining constants:\n\n-21952/1568 -2177/1568 -39375/1568= (-21952 -2177 -39375)/1568.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n21952 +2177=24129; 24129 +39375=63504.\n\nSo, -63504/1568.\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n14/5 x +311\u221a14/280 y -63504/1568=0.\n\nMultiply all terms by 1568 to eliminate denominators:\n\n14/5 x *1568 +311\u221a14/280 y *1568 -63504=0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n14/5 *1568=14*313.6=4390.4.\n\n311\u221a14/280 *1568=311\u221a14*(1568/280)=311\u221a14*(56/10)=311\u221a14*(28/5)= (311*28/5)\u221a14= (8708/5)\u221a14.\n\nSo, equation:\n\n4390.4 x + (8708/5)\u221a14 y -63504=0.\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe I made a mistake in computation. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to find point D.\n\nWait, point D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C. We have the equations of these two tangents: tangent at C is x + (\u221a14/56)y=0, and tangent at B is (14/5)(x -5) + (311\u221a14/280)(y -5\u221a14/56)=5625/224.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps solving these two equations together would give point D.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1. x + (\u221a14/56)y =0. Let me write this as equation (1).\n\n2. (14/5)(x -5) + (311\u221a14/280)(y -5\u221a14/56)=5625/224. Let's write this as equation (2).\n\nLet me solve equation (1) for x: x= - (\u221a14/56)y.\n\nSubstitute x into equation (2):\n\n(14/5)(-\u221a14/56 y -5) + (311\u221a14/280)(y -5\u221a14/56)=5625/224.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (14/5)*(-\u221a14/56 y -5)= (14/5)*(-\u221a14/56 y) + (14/5)*(-5).\n\nCompute (14/5)*(-\u221a14/56 y)= (14*(-\u221a14))/(5*56) y= (-\u221a14)/(20) y.\n\nAnd (14/5)*(-5)= -14.\n\nSecond term: (311\u221a14/280)*(y -5\u221a14/56)= (311\u221a14/280)y - (311\u221a14/280)*(5\u221a14/56).\n\nCompute each part:\n\n(311\u221a14/280)y remains as is.\n\n(311\u221a14/280)*(5\u221a14/56)= (311*5*14)/(280*56).\n\nCompute numerator: 311*5=1555; 1555*14=21770.\n\nDenominator:280*56=15680.\n\nSo, 21770/15680=2177/1568.\n\nSo, putting it all together, equation (2) becomes:\n\n[ (-\u221a14/20)y -14 ] + [ (311\u221a14/280)y -2177/1568 ] =5625/224.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nTerms with y: (-\u221a14/20 + 311\u221a14/280) y.\n\nConstant terms: -14 -2177/1568.\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\nFor y:\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 280.\n\n-\u221a14/20 = -14\u221a14/280.\n\n311\u221a14/280 is as is.\n\nSo, total: (-14\u221a14 +311\u221a14)/280 = (297\u221a14)/280.\n\nFor constants:\n\n-14= -14*1568/1568= -21952/1568.\n\n-2177/1568 is as is.\n\nSo, total constants: (-21952 -2177)/1568= -24129/1568.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(297\u221a14/280)y -24129/1568 =5625/224.\n\nMultiply both sides by 1568 to eliminate denominators:\n\n297\u221a14/280 *1568 y -24129 =5625/224 *1568.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n297\u221a14/280 *1568=297\u221a14*(1568/280)=297\u221a14*(56/10)=297\u221a14*(28/5)= (297*28/5)\u221a14.\n\n297*28=8316; 8316/5=1663.2.\n\nSo, first term:1663.2\u221a14 y.\n\nSecond term: -24129.\n\nThird term:5625/224 *1568=5625*(1568/224)=5625*7=39375.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n1663.2\u221a14 y -24129 =39375.\n\nMove constants to right:\n\n1663.2\u221a14 y=39375 +24129=63504.\n\nThus, y=63504/(1663.2\u221a14).\n\nCompute 63504/1663.2:\n\nLet me compute 63504 \u00f71663.2.\n\n1663.2 *38=1663.2*30=49896; 1663.2*8=13305.6; total=49896+13305.6=63201.6.\n\n63504-63201.6=302.4.\n\n1663.2*0.18=1663.2*0.1=166.32; 1663.2*0.08=133.056.

We need to find the equation of line AD, then find its intersection P with \u03c9 (the circumcircle), other than A.\n\nFirst, find the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nPoint A is (10,0), point D is (-15/22,30\u221a14/11).\n\nVector from A to D: (-15/22 -10, 30\u221a14/11 -0)= (- (15/22 +220/22), 30\u221a14/11)= (-235/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nParametric equations:\n\nx=10 + t*(-235/22).\n\ny=0 + t*(30\u221a14/11).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nx=10 - (235/22)t.\n\ny= (30\u221a14/11) t.\n\nWe need to find t where this line intersects the circumcircle \u03c9 again at point P.\n\nThe circumcircle equation is (x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nSubstitute x and y from the parametric equations into the circle equation.\n\nSo,\n\n[10 - (235/22)t -5]^2 + [ (30\u221a14/11)t -5\u221a14/56 ]^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nSimplify each bracket:\n\nFirst term: [5 - (235/22)t]^2.\n\nSecond term: [ (30\u221a14/11)t -5\u221a14/56 ]^2.\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst term:\n\n5 - (235/22)t = (110/22 -235 t /22 )= (110 -235 t)/22.\n\nSo, squared: (110 -235 t)^2 / (22)^2.\n\nSecond term:\n\nFactor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (30/11)t -5/56 ].\n\nSo, inside the square: [\u221a14 (30t/11 -5/56)]^2 =14*(30t/11 -5/56)^2.\n\nSo, second term is 14*(30t/11 -5/56)^2.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n[(110 -235 t)^2 ]/(22)^2 +14*(30t/11 -5/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nCompute each part.\n\nFirst, compute (75\u221a14/56)^2= (75^2 *14)/(56^2)= (5625*14)/(3136)=78750/3136.\n\nNow, compute the left side.\n\nFirst term: (110 -235 t)^2 / (484).\n\nSecond term:14*( (30t/11 -5/56)^2 ).\n\nLet me compute (30t/11 -5/56):\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 616 (11*56).\n\n30t/11= (30t*56)/616=1680t/616.\n\n5/56=55/616.\n\nSo, 30t/11 -5/56= (1680t -55)/616.\n\nThus, (30t/11 -5/56)^2= (1680t -55)^2 / (616)^2.\n\nSo, second term becomes:\n\n14*(1680t -55)^2 / (616)^2.\n\nSo, left side equation:\n\n[(110 -235 t)^2 ]/484 + [14*(1680t -55)^2 ]/ (616)^2 =78750/3136.\n\nMultiply both sides by 484*(616)^2 to eliminate denominators.\n\nBut that seems very cumbersome. Alternatively, perhaps we can find t such that t=0 corresponds to point A, and t=1 corresponds to point D.\n\nBut point P is another intersection, so t\u22600. Let's find t such that the parametric equations satisfy the circle equation.\n\nAlternatively, since A is on the circle, when t=0, the equation holds. So, the other solution will correspond to t\u22600.\n\nSo, expanding the equation:\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: (110 -235 t)^2 / (22)^2 = (110 -235t)^2 /484.\n\nSecond term:14*(30t/11 -5/56)^2=14*( (30t/11 -5/56)^2 ).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nCompute (110 -235 t)^2:\n\n=110\u00b2 -2*110*235 t + (235t)^2=12100 -51700 t +55225 t\u00b2.\n\nSo, first term: (12100 -51700 t +55225 t\u00b2)/484.\n\nSecond term:14*(30t/11 -5/56)^2.\n\nCompute inside the square:\n\n30t/11 -5/56= (30t*56 -5*11)/(11*56)= (1680t -55)/616.\n\nSo, squared: (1680t -55)^2 / (616)^2.\n\nThus, second term:14*(1680t -55)^2 / (616)^2.\n\nCompute numerator:14*(1680t -55)^2.\n\nDenominator:616\u00b2=379456.\n\nSo, second term: [14*(1680t -55)^2 ] /379456.\n\nNow, the equation is:\n\n(12100 -51700 t +55225 t\u00b2)/484 + [14*(1680t -55)^2 ] /379456 =78750/3136.\n\nMultiply all terms by 379456*484 to eliminate denominators.\n\nBut that would be a huge number. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to substitute t=1 and see if it satisfies, but t=1 is point D, which is outside the circle, so it won't satisfy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps find t such that the equation holds.\n\nBut this seems very involved. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps using power of point D with respect to \u03c9: DB\u00b2 = DP * DA.\n\nWe have DB as the length from D to B. Since D is the ex-tangent point, DB=DC.\n\nWe can compute DB using coordinates.\n\nPoint D is (-15/22,30\u221a14/11).\n\nPoint B is (39/5,6\u221a14/5).\n\nCompute distance DB:\n\nDB\u00b2= (39/5 +15/22)^2 + (6\u221a14/5 -30\u221a14/11)^2.\n\nCompute each term.\n\nFirst term:39/5 +15/22= (39*22 +15*5)/(5*22)= (858 +75)/110=933/110.\n\nSo, (933/110)^2= (933\u00b2)/(110\u00b2).\n\nCompute 933\u00b2: Let's compute 930\u00b2=864900, plus 2*930*3=5580, plus 3\u00b2=9. So, 864900+5580+9=870489.\n\nSo, (933)^2=870489.\n\nThus, (933/110)^2=870489/12100.\n\nSecond term:6\u221a14/5 -30\u221a14/11= (6\u221a14*11 -30\u221a14*5)/(5*11)= (66\u221a14 -150\u221a14)/55= (-84\u221a14)/55.\n\nSo, squared: (84\u00b2 *14)/(55\u00b2)= (7056 *14)/3025=98784/3025.\n\nSo, DB\u00b2=870489/12100 +98784/3025.\n\nConvert 98784/3025 to denominator 12100: multiply numerator and denominator by 4: 395136/12100.\n\nSo, DB\u00b2=870489/12100 +395136/12100= (870489+395136)/12100=1,265,625/12100.\n\nSimplify:1,265,625 \u00f725=50,625; 12100 \u00f725=484.\n\nSo, 50625/484.\n\nThus, DB\u00b2=50625/484.\n\nSo, the power of D is DB\u00b2=50625/484= DP * DA.\n\nWe can compute DA, the distance from D to A.\n\nPoint A is (10,0), point D is (-15/22,30\u221a14/11).\n\nCompute DA:\n\nDA\u00b2=(10 +15/22)^2 + (0 -30\u221a14/11)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n10 +15/22= (220 +15)/22=235/22.\n\nSo, (235/22)^2=55225/484.\n\nSecond term: (30\u221a14/11)^2=900*14/121=12600/121.\n\nSo, DA\u00b2=55225/484 +12600/121.\n\nConvert 12600/121 to denominator 484: multiply numerator and denominator by 4:50400/484.\n\nSo, DA\u00b2=55225/484 +50400/484=105625/484.\n\nThus, DA= sqrt(105625/484)=325/22.\n\nSo, DA=325/22.\n\nSo, from power of a point: DB\u00b2= DP * DA.\n\nWe have DB\u00b2=50625/484, DA=325/22.\n\nSo, DP= (50625/484)/(325/22)= (50625/484)*(22/325).\n\nSimplify:\n\n50625 \u00f7325=50625 \u00f725=2025; 2025 \u00f713=155.769\u2026 Wait, perhaps factor:\n\n50625= 50625=225\u00b2= (15\u00b2)\u00b2=15^4.\n\n325=5^2 *13.\n\nSo, 50625/325= (15^4)/(5^2 *13)= (3^4 *5^4)/(5^2 *13)=3^4 *5^2 /13=81*25/13=2025/13.\n\nSimilarly, 22/484=22/(22^2)=1/22.\n\nSo, DP= (2025/13)*(1/22)=2025/(13*22)=2025/286.\n\nSimplify 2025/286: 2025 \u00f713=155.769\u2026 Hmm, but 2025=45\u00b2= (9*5)^2=9\u00b2*5\u00b2=81*25. 286=2*11*13.\n\nSo, no common factors, so DP=2025/286.\n\nThen, since DA=325/22, AP= DA - DP? Wait, no, because DP is from D to P, and DA is from D to A. Since P is beyond A on the line AD, AP would be DA + DP?\n\nWait, no. Let me think. Point D is outside the circle, point A is on the circle, and P is the second intersection point on AD beyond A. So, the line goes D---A---P. So, DA is from D to A, and DP is from D to P, so DP = DA + AP.\n\nWait, no, because from D to A is DA, then from A to P is AP, so DP = DA + AP. So, AP= DP - DA.\n\nBut wait, power of point says DP * DA = DB\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, the power of point D is DP * DA = DB\u00b2. So, in this case, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P. So, if P is on the extension beyond A, then DP = DA + AP. So, the power of point D is DP * DA = DB\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, the power of a point outside the circle is equal to the product of the distances from the point to the intersection points along any secant line. So, in this case, D is outside, and AD is a secant line intersecting the circle at A and P. So, the power of D is DA * DP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, the correct formula is DA * DP = DB\u00b2. But depending on the notation, sometimes it's written as DP * DA, but it's actually DA * DP because DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is from D to P. But since A is between D and P, DP = DA + AP. So, DA * DP = DA*(DA + AP) = DB\u00b2.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as DP * DA = DB\u00b2. So, perhaps it's the same thing.\n\nSo, in any case, DA * DP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWe have DA=325/22, DB\u00b2=50625/484.\n\nSo, DP= DB\u00b2 / DA= (50625/484) / (325/22)= (50625/484)*(22/325).\n\nCompute this:\n\n50625 \u00f7325= (50625 \u00f725)=2025; 2025 \u00f713=155.769. Wait, let's factor:\n\n50625= 225\u00b2= (15\u00b2)\u00b2=15^4.\n\n325=5\u00b2 *13.\n\nSo, 50625 /325= (15^4)/(5\u00b2 *13)= (3^4 *5^4)/(5\u00b2 *13)= 3^4 *5\u00b2 /13=81*25/13=2025/13.\n\nSimilarly, 22/484=1/22.\n\nSo, DP= (2025/13)*(1/22)=2025/(13*22)=2025/286.\n\nSo, DP=2025/286.\n\nNow, AP is the distance from A to P.\n\nSince DP = DA + AP, then AP= DP - DA.\n\nBut DA=325/22, DP=2025/286.\n\nCompute 325/22 in terms of denominator 286: 22*13=286. So, 325/22= (325*13)/286=4225/286.\n\nSo, AP= DP - DA=2025/286 -4225/286= (2025 -4225)/286= (-2200)/286= -1100/143.\n\nWait, that can't be. Negative length doesn't make sense. So, perhaps my assumption about the direction is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps AP= DA - DP?\n\nWait, since P is beyond A from D, then DA is from D to A, and DP is from D to P, so DP= DA + AP.\n\nSo, AP= DP - DA.\n\nBut if DA=325/22\u224814.77, DP=2025/286\u22487.08. Wait, that can't be because DP is shorter than DA, which would mean P is between D and A, which contradicts the fact that A is on the circle and P is the second intersection.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the power of a point formula.\n\nWait, actually, the power of point D is equal to DB\u00b2= DC\u00b2= DP * DA.\n\nBut in this case, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P, but since P is on the extension beyond A, DP is longer than DA. So, actually, DP= DA + AP.\n\nBut in the power of a point formula, it's DA * DP = DB\u00b2, where DA is the length from D to A, and DP is from D to P.\n\nBut since A is on the circle, DA is the tangent length? Wait, no, DA is a secant.\n\nWait, no, the power of a point D outside the circle is equal to the product of the lengths from D to the two intersection points of any secant line through D. In this case, the secant is DAP, so DP * DA = DB\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, actually, the formula is DP * DA = DB\u00b2, but DP is the entire length from D to P, and DA is from D to A. Since P is beyond A, DP = DA + AP. So, DA * (DA + AP) = DB\u00b2.\n\nSo, DA^2 + DA * AP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWe have DA=325/22, DB\u00b2=50625/484.\n\nSo, (325/22)^2 + (325/22)*AP =50625/484.\n\nCompute (325/22)^2=105625/484.\n\nSo, 105625/484 + (325/22)*AP =50625/484.\n\nSubtract 105625/484 from both sides:\n\n(325/22)*AP = (50625 -105625)/484= (-55000)/484.\n\nSo, (325/22)*AP= -55000/484.\n\nMultiply both sides by 22/325:\n\nAP= (-55000/484)*(22/325)= (-55000*22)/(484*325).\n\nSimplify:\n\n55000=55*1000=5*11*1000.\n\n22=2*11.\n\n484=22\u00b2=4*121=4*11\u00b2.\n\n325=5\u00b2*13.\n\nSo,\n\nAP= (-5*11*1000 *2*11)/(4*11\u00b2 *5\u00b2 *13).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: (-5*11*1000 *2*11)= -5*2*11\u00b2*1000= -10*121*1000= -1210000.\n\nDenominator:4*11\u00b2*5\u00b2*13=4*121*25*13=4*121=484; 484*25=12100; 12100*13=157300.\n\nSo, AP= -1210000 /157300= -12100/1573.\n\nSimplify: Divide numerator and denominator by 121.\n\n12100 \u00f7121=100.\n\n1573 \u00f7121=13.\n\nSo, AP= -100/13.\n\nBut length can't be negative. So, absolute value: AP=100/13.\n\nSo, AP=100/13, which simplifies to 100/13. Since 100 and 13 are coprime, m=100, n=13, so m +n=113.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the answer is 100/13, so 100 +13=113.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem is about triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then AD intersects \u03c9 again at P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nFirst, I'll try to visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle \u03c9 is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D, so D is the exsimilicenter or the external homothety center of the two tangents. Then, connecting A to D, the line AD intersects the circle \u03c9 again at point P. We need to find the length AP.\n\nI remember that when dealing with tangents to a circle, the lengths from the external point to the points of tangency are equal. So, for point D, the lengths DB and DC should be equal because they are both tangents from D to \u03c9. That means triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.\n\nNow, how can I relate this to point P? Since AD intersects \u03c9 again at P, perhaps there's a power of a point theorem involved here. The power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DP * DA. Wait, let me think. The power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to the square of the tangent from D to \u03c9, which is DB (or DC). So, power of D: DB\u00b2 = DP * DA.\n\nSo, if I can find DB, I can express DP in terms of DA. Then, AP would be DA - DP, or DP = DA - AP. Wait, no, AP is the segment from A to P, so actually, DA is the entire length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So, AP would be DA - DP? Hmm, not exactly. Because A is outside the circle, and P is the second intersection point. Wait, no. A is on the circle, so DA is a secant that starts at D, goes through A, and then intersects the circle again at P. So, the power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is DP * DA = DB\u00b2. So, DP * DA = DB\u00b2. So, if I can find DB and DA, I can find DP, then AP would be DA - DP, since AP is from A to P, and DP is from D to P, so AP = DA - DP.\n\nBut wait, actually, DA is from D to A, and AP is from A to P, so DP is from D to P, which is DA + AP? No, that can't be. Because D is outside the circle, and A is on the circle, so the line DA passes through A and then P is on the other side. So, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So, DP = DA + AP? Hmm, no. Wait, the points are D, then A, then P along the line. So, DA is the distance from D to A, and AP is from A to P, so DP = DA + AP. But that would mean that the power of D is DP * DA = DB\u00b2. Wait, no, the power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is DP * DA = DB\u00b2. So, if DP is the entire length from D to P, and DA is from D to A, then DP * DA = DB\u00b2. So, DP = DA + AP, so (DA + AP) * DA = DB\u00b2. That gives us an equation: DA\u00b2 + DA * AP = DB\u00b2.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to approach this. Perhaps using harmonic division or something related to poles and polars. Alternatively, maybe using inversion, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since ABC is a triangle with known side lengths, perhaps we can compute its circumradius, then find coordinates or use coordinate geometry to find point D and then find AP.\n\nLet me first compute the circumradius of triangle ABC. The formula for the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where a, b, c are the sides, and \u0394 is the area.\n\nGiven sides: AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, a=5, b=9, c=10? Wait, actually, in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. So, a=9, b=10, c=5.\n\nWait, no, let me confirm: in triangle ABC, side a is opposite vertex A, which is BC. So, a = BC = 9, side b is AC =10, side c is AB=5.\n\nFirst, let's compute the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (9 + 10 +5)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.\n\nThen, the area \u0394 can be found using Heron's formula: sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)].\n\nSo, \u0394 = sqrt[12*(12-9)*(12-10)*(12-5)] = sqrt[12*3*2*7] = sqrt[12*42] = sqrt[504].\n\nSimplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, no, 504 = 16 * 31.5 is incorrect. Let's factor 504: 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which isn't an integer. Let me do prime factors.\n\n504: 504 / 2 = 252; 252 / 2 = 126; 126 / 2 = 63; 63 / 3 = 21; 21 /3=7. So, 2^3 * 3^2 *7. So, sqrt(504)=sqrt(2^3*3^2*7)= 2^(1.5)*3*sqrt(7)= 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7)= 6*sqrt(14). So, \u0394=6*sqrt(14).\n\nThen, the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4\u0394) = (9*10*5)/(4*6*sqrt(14)) = (450)/(24*sqrt(14)) = (75)/(4*sqrt(14)).\n\nWe can rationalize the denominator: (75)/(4*sqrt(14)) = (75*sqrt(14))/(4*14) = (75*sqrt(14))/56. So, R = 75\u221a14 /56.\n\nHmm, okay, so R is known. But how does that help us? Well, perhaps knowing R can help in coordinate geometry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry to model the triangle and compute the required lengths.\n\nLet me try setting up coordinates. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0). Then, since AC=10, and AB=5, BC=9. So, point A is somewhere, point B is somewhere.\n\nWait, if I set C at (0,0), then point A is somewhere on the x-axis at (10,0), since AC=10. Then, point B is somewhere in the plane. Let's find the coordinates of B.\n\nSo, points: C=(0,0), A=(10,0). We need to find point B such that AB=5, BC=9.\n\nSo, the distance from A to B is 5: sqrt[(x-10)^2 + y^2] =5.\n\nThe distance from B to C is 9: sqrt[x^2 + y^2] =9.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. (x)^2 + y^2 = 81.\n\n2. (x-10)^2 + y^2 =25.\n\nSubtracting equation 2 from equation 1:\n\nx^2 + y^2 - [(x-10)^2 + y^2] =81 -25=56.\n\nExpanding (x-10)^2: x^2 -20x +100.\n\nSo, x^2 + y^2 - (x^2 -20x +100 + y^2) =56.\n\nSimplify: x^2 + y^2 -x^2 +20x -100 -y^2 =56.\n\nSo, 20x -100 =56.\n\n20x=156 \u2192 x=156/20=7.8.\n\nSo, x=7.8, which is 39/5. Then, plugging back into equation 1 to find y.\n\nx=39/5, so x\u00b2= (39/5)^2=1521/25.\n\nSo, 1521/25 + y\u00b2=81.\n\n81 is 2025/25.\n\nSo, y\u00b2=2025/25 -1521/25= (2025-1521)/25=504/25.\n\nThus, y= sqrt(504)/5= (6*sqrt(14))/5.\n\nSo, point B is at (7.8, (6\u221a14)/5) which is (39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo, coordinates:\n\nA=(10,0), B=(39/5, 6\u221a14/5), C=(0,0).\n\nNow, we can find the circumcircle \u03c9. Since points A, B, C are known, we can compute the circumcircle's equation.\n\nAlternatively, since we know the circumradius R=75\u221a14/56, and the circumcenter O. Let's compute O's coordinates.\n\nWait, the circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides.\n\nLet's compute the perpendicular bisector of AC and BC.\n\nBut wait, AC is from (10,0) to (0,0), so its midpoint is (5,0). The perpendicular bisector is the line perpendicular to AC (which is along the x-axis) at (5,0). So, the perpendicular bisector is the line x=5.\n\nNow, find the perpendicular bisector of BC. Point B is (39/5,6\u221a14/5), point C is (0,0). The midpoint of BC is ((39/5)/2, (6\u221a14/5)/2) = (39/10, 3\u221a14/5).\n\nThe slope of BC is (6\u221a14/5 -0)/(39/5 -0)= (6\u221a14/5)/(39/5)=6\u221a14/39= 2\u221a14/13.\n\nSo, the slope of BC is 2\u221a14/13, so the perpendicular bisector will have slope -13/(2\u221a14).\n\nSo, the equation of the perpendicular bisector of BC is y - 3\u221a14/5 = (-13/(2\u221a14))(x - 39/10).\n\nNow, the circumcenter O lies at the intersection of x=5 and this line.\n\nSubstitute x=5 into the equation:\n\ny - 3\u221a14/5 = (-13/(2\u221a14))(5 - 39/10).\n\nCompute 5 -39/10 = (50/10 -39/10)=11/10.\n\nSo, y - 3\u221a14/5 = (-13/(2\u221a14))*(11/10) = (-143)/(20\u221a14).\n\nSo, y= 3\u221a14/5 -143/(20\u221a14).\n\nLet me rationalize the second term:\n\n143/(20\u221a14) = (143\u221a14)/(20*14)= (143\u221a14)/280.\n\nSo, y= (3\u221a14)/5 - (143\u221a14)/280.\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 280.\n\n(3\u221a14)/5 = (3\u221a14 *56)/280=168\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, y= 168\u221a14/280 -143\u221a14/280 = (168-143)\u221a14/280=25\u221a14/280=5\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, the circumcenter O is at (5,5\u221a14/56).\n\nWait, that seems a bit small, but okay.\n\nSo, O=(5,5\u221a14/56).\n\nNow, with O known, we can find the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = R^2. Here, h=5, k=5\u221a14/56.\n\nSo, equation: (x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nLet me compute R^2:\n\n(75\u221a14/56)^2 = (75^2 *14)/(56^2)= (5625*14)/(3136)=78750/3136.\n\nSimplify 78750/3136: Let's divide numerator and denominator by 2: 39375/1568. Hmm, maybe not necessary right now.\n\nSo, equation of \u03c9 is (x-5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 =78750/3136.\n\nNow, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.\n\nWait, the tangent at B and tangent at C intersect at D.\n\nIn coordinate geometry, the equation of the tangent to a circle at a point (x1,y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R^2, but wait, no. The equation of the tangent line at (x1, y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R^2? Wait, no, that's the equation of the circle.\n\nWait, the tangent line at (x1,y1) on the circle with center (h,k) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R^2. No, that's not correct. Wait, actually, the equation of the tangent line is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = (x1 - h)^2 + (y1 - k)^2. But since (x1,y1) is on the circle, (x1 - h)^2 + (y1 - k)^2 = R^2, so the equation simplifies to (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R^2.\n\nAlternatively, another formula is that the tangent line at (x1,y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R^2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the point form of the tangent.\n\nAlternatively, for a circle with center (h,k), the equation of the tangent at point (x1,y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R^2.\n\nBut let me verify this with a simple case. For example, the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = R\u00b2, the tangent at (x1,y1) is xx1 + yy1 = R\u00b2. So, yes, in that case, (x1 - 0)(x - 0) + (y1 - 0)(y - 0) = R\u00b2, which is correct.\n\nSo, yes, in general, for a circle with center (h,k), the tangent at (x1,y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at B is (xB -5)(x -5) + (yB -5\u221a14/56)(y -5\u221a14/56) = R\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at C is (xC -5)(x -5) + (yC -5\u221a14/56)(y -5\u221a14/56) = R\u00b2.\n\nBut point C is (0,0), so tangent at C is (0 -5)(x -5) + (0 -5\u221a14/56)(y -5\u221a14/56) = R\u00b2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-5)(x -5) + (-5\u221a14/56)(y -5\u221a14/56) = R\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, tangent at B: (xB -5)(x -5) + (yB -5\u221a14/56)(y -5\u221a14/56) = R\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute these equations step by step.\n\nFirst, tangent at C: (-5)(x -5) + (-5\u221a14/56)(y -5\u221a14/56) = R\u00b2.\n\nCompute left side:\n\n-5x +25 - (5\u221a14/56)y + (5\u221a14/56)*(5\u221a14/56) = R\u00b2.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n-5x +25 - (5\u221a14/56)y + (25*14)/(56^2) = R\u00b2.\n\nCompute 25*14=350, and 56^2=3136.\n\nSo, 350/3136= 175/1568.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n-5x +25 - (5\u221a14/56)y +175/1568 = R\u00b2.\n\nBut R\u00b2=78750/3136, which is approximately 25.125.\n\nWait, let's compute 78750/3136:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 14: 78750/14=5625, 3136/14=224.\n\nSo, 5625/224 \u224825.125.\n\nSo, R\u00b2=5625/224.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n-5x +25 - (5\u221a14/56)y +175/1568 =5625/224.\n\nLet me convert all terms to have denominator 1568 for easy addition.\n\n25 is 25*1568/1568=39200/1568.\n\n175/1568 is already over 1568.\n\n5625/224= (5625*7)/1568=39375/1568.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n-5x - (5\u221a14/56)y +39200/1568 +175/1568 =39375/1568.\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n39200 +175=39375.\n\nSo, -5x - (5\u221a14/56)y +39375/1568 =39375/1568.\n\nSubtract 39375/1568 from both sides:\n\n-5x - (5\u221a14/56)y =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n5x + (5\u221a14/56)y =0.\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nx + (\u221a14/56)y =0.\n\nSo, the tangent at C is x + (\u221a14/56)y =0.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, original equation after expanding:\n\n-5x +25 - (5\u221a14/56)y +175/1568 =5625/224.\n\nBut 5625/224 is equal to 5625/(32*7)=5625/224\u224825.125.\n\nBut 25 is 25, and 175/1568\u22480.1115.\n\nSo, 25 + 0.1115\u224825.1115, which is approximately 5625/224\u224825.125. Hmm, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, moving all terms to left:\n\n-5x +25 - (5\u221a14/56)y +175/1568 -5625/224=0.\n\nBut I think my earlier approach was correct, but perhaps there was an error in the signs.\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nThe equation is:\n\n-5x +25 - (5\u221a14/56)y +175/1568 =5625/224.\n\nSubtract 5625/224 from both sides:\n\n-5x +25 - (5\u221a14/56)y +175/1568 -5625/224=0.\n\nConvert all terms to denominator 1568.\n\n25=25*1568/1568=39200/1568.\n\n175/1568 is as is.\n\n5625/224=5625*7/1568=39375/1568.\n\nSo,\n\n-5x - (5\u221a14/56)y +39200/1568 +175/1568 -39375/1568=0.\n\nCombine constants:\n\n39200 +175=39375; 39375 -39375=0.\n\nSo, the equation reduces to:\n\n-5x - (5\u221a14/56)y=0.\n\nWhich simplifies to 5x + (5\u221a14/56)y=0, then dividing by 5:\n\nx + (\u221a14/56)y=0.\n\nSo, the tangent at C is x + (\u221a14/56)y=0.\n\nSimilarly, let's find the tangent at B.\n\nPoint B is (39/5,6\u221a14/5). So, the tangent at B is:\n\n(xB -5)(x -5) + (yB -5\u221a14/56)(y -5\u221a14/56)=R\u00b2.\n\nCompute each part:\n\nxB -5=39/5 -25/5=14/5.\n\nyB -5\u221a14/56=6\u221a14/5 -5\u221a14/56= (6\u221a14*56 -5\u221a14*5)/(5*56)= (336\u221a14 -25\u221a14)/280= 311\u221a14/280.\n\nSo, the tangent equation is:\n\n(14/5)(x -5) + (311\u221a14/280)(y -5\u221a14/56)=5625/224.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n14/5 *x -14/5 *5 + (311\u221a14/280)y - (311\u221a14/280)*(5\u221a14/56)=5625/224.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n14/5 x -14 + (311\u221a14/280)y - [ (311\u221a14 *5\u221a14 )/(280*56) ].\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 14/5 x.\n\nSecond term: -14.\n\nThird term: 311\u221a14/280 y.\n\nFourth term: numerator is 311 *5 *14=311*70=21770. Denominator:280*56=15680.\n\nSo, the fourth term is 21770/15680.\n\nSimplify 21770/15680: divide numerator and denominator by 10: 2177/1568.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n14/5 x -14 + 311\u221a14/280 y -2177/1568 =5625/224.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n14/5 x +311\u221a14/280 y -14 -2177/1568 -5625/224=0.\n\nConvert all constants to denominator 1568.\n\n-14= -14*1568/1568= -21952/1568.\n\n-2177/1568 is as is.\n\n-5625/224= -5625*7/1568= -39375/1568.\n\nSo, combining constants:\n\n-21952/1568 -2177/1568 -39375/1568= (-21952 -2177 -39375)/1568.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n21952 +2177=24129; 24129 +39375=63504.\n\nSo, -63504/1568.\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n14/5 x +311\u221a14/280 y -63504/1568=0.\n\nMultiply all terms by 1568 to eliminate denominators:\n\n14/5 x *1568 +311\u221a14/280 y *1568 -63504=0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n14/5 *1568=14*313.6=4390.4.\n\n311\u221a14/280 *1568=311\u221a14*(1568/280)=311\u221a14*(56/10)=311\u221a14*(28/5)= (311*28/5)\u221a14= (8708/5)\u221a14.\n\nSo, equation:\n\n4390.4 x + (8708/5)\u221a14 y -63504=0.\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe I made a mistake in computation. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to find point D.\n\nWait, point D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C. We have the equations of these two tangents: tangent at C is x + (\u221a14/56)y=0, and tangent at B is (14/5)(x -5) + (311\u221a14/280)(y -5\u221a14/56)=5625/224.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps solving these two equations together would give point D.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1. x + (\u221a14/56)y =0. Let me write this as equation (1).\n\n2. (14/5)(x -5) + (311\u221a14/280)(y -5\u221a14/56)=5625/224. Let's write this as equation (2).\n\nLet me solve equation (1) for x: x= - (\u221a14/56)y.\n\nSubstitute x into equation (2):\n\n(14/5)(-\u221a14/56 y -5) + (311\u221a14/280)(y -5\u221a14/56)=5625/224.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (14/5)*(-\u221a14/56 y -5)= (14/5)*(-\u221a14/56 y) + (14/5)*(-5).\n\nCompute (14/5)*(-\u221a14/56 y)= (14*(-\u221a14))/(5*56) y= (-\u221a14)/(20) y.\n\nAnd (14/5)*(-5)= -14.\n\nSecond term: (311\u221a14/280)*(y -5\u221a14/56)= (311\u221a14/280)y - (311\u221a14/280)*(5\u221a14/56).\n\nCompute each part:\n\n(311\u221a14/280)y remains as is.\n\n(311\u221a14/280)*(5\u221a14/56)= (311*5*14)/(280*56).\n\nCompute numerator: 311*5=1555; 1555*14=21770.\n\nDenominator:280*56=15680.\n\nSo, 21770/15680=2177/1568.\n\nSo, putting it all together, equation (2) becomes:\n\n[ (-\u221a14/20)y -14 ] + [ (311\u221a14/280)y -2177/1568 ] =5625/224.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nTerms with y: (-\u221a14/20 + 311\u221a14/280) y.\n\nConstant terms: -14 -2177/1568.\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\nFor y:\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 280.\n\n-\u221a14/20 = -14\u221a14/280.\n\n311\u221a14/280 is as is.\n\nSo, total: (-14\u221a14 +311\u221a14)/280 = (297\u221a14)/280.\n\nFor constants:\n\n-14= -14*1568/1568= -21952/1568.\n\n-2177/1568 is as is.\n\nSo, total constants: (-21952 -2177)/1568= -24129/1568.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(297\u221a14/280)y -24129/1568 =5625/224.\n\nMultiply both sides by 1568 to eliminate denominators:\n\n297\u221a14/280 *1568 y -24129 =5625/224 *1568.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n297\u221a14/280 *1568=297\u221a14*(1568/280)=297\u221a14*(56/10)=297\u221a14*(28/5)= (297*28/5)\u221a14.\n\n297*28=8316; 8316/5=1663.2.\n\nSo, first term:1663.2\u221a14 y.\n\nSecond term: -24129.\n\nThird term:5625/224 *1568=5625*(1568/224)=5625*7=39375.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n1663.2\u221a14 y -24129 =39375.\n\nMove constants to right:\n\n1663.2\u221a14 y=39375 +24129=63504.\n\nThus, y=63504/(1663.2\u221a14).\n\nCompute 63504/1663.2:\n\nLet me compute 63504 \u00f71663.2.\n\n1663.2 *38=1663.2*30=49896; 1663.2*8=13305.6; total=49896+13305.6=63201.6.\n\n63504-63201.6=302.4.\n\n1663.2*0.18=1663.2*0.1=166.32; 1663.2*0.08=133.056.

Maybe I should use fractions.\n\nWait, 63504=63504.\n\n1663.2=16632/10=8316/5.\n\nSo, y=63504/(8316/5 *\u221a14)= (63504*5)/(8316\u221a14)= (317520)/(8316\u221a14).\n\nSimplify 317520 /8316.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 12: 317520/12=26460; 8316/12=693.\n\n26460 /693.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 21: 26460/21=1260; 693/21=33.\n\nSo, 1260/33=420/11.\n\nSo, y= (420/11)/\u221a14=420/(11\u221a14).\n\nRationalize denominator: 420\u221a14/(11*14)=420\u221a14/(154)= (420/154)\u221a14= (30/11)\u221a14.\n\nSo, y= (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nThen, from equation (1): x= - (\u221a14/56)y= - (\u221a14/56)*(30\u221a14/11)= - (14*30)/(56*11).\n\nSimplify:\n\n14 and 56: 14 divides into 56 four times. 30 and 56: no common factors.\n\nSo, 14*30=420; 56*11=616.\n\nSo, x= -420/616= -105/154.\n\nSimplify 105/154: both divided by 7: 15/22.\n\nSo, x= -15/22.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, we have point D at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nPoint A is at (10,0). We need to find the equation of line AD, then find its intersection P with \u03c9 (the circumcircle), other than A.\n\nFirst, find the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nPoint A is (10,0), point D is (-15/22,30\u221a14/11).\n\nVector from A to D: (-15/22 -10, 30\u221a14/11 -0)= (- (15/22 +220/22), 30\u221a14/11)= (-235/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nParametric equations:\n\nx=10 + t*(-235/22).\n\ny=0 + t*(30\u221a14/11).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nx=10 - (235/22)t.\n\ny= (30\u221a14/11) t.\n\nWe need to find t where this line intersects the circumcircle \u03c9 again at point P.\n\nThe circumcircle equation is (x -5)^2 + (y -5\u221a14/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nSubstitute x and y from the parametric equations into the circle equation.\n\nSo,\n\n[10 - (235/22)t -5]^2 + [ (30\u221a14/11)t -5\u221a14/56 ]^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nSimplify each bracket:\n\nFirst term: [5 - (235/22)t]^2.\n\nSecond term: [ (30\u221a14/11)t -5\u221a14/56 ]^2.\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst term:\n\n5 - (235/22)t = (110/22 -235 t /22 )= (110 -235 t)/22.\n\nSo, squared: (110 -235 t)^2 / (22)^2.\n\nSecond term:\n\nFactor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (30/11)t -5/56 ].\n\nSo, inside the square: [\u221a14 (30t/11 -5/56)]^2 =14*(30t/11 -5/56)^2.\n\nSo, second term is 14*(30t/11 -5/56)^2.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n[(110 -235 t)^2 ]/(22)^2 +14*(30t/11 -5/56)^2 = (75\u221a14/56)^2.\n\nCompute each part.\n\nFirst, compute (75\u221a14/56)^2= (75^2 *14)/(56^2)= (5625*14)/(3136)=78750/3136.\n\nNow, compute the left side.\n\nFirst term: (110 -235 t)^2 / (484).\n\nSecond term:14*( (30t/11 -5/56)^2 ).\n\nLet me compute (30t/11 -5/56):\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 616 (11*56).\n\n30t/11= (30t*56)/616=1680t/616.\n\n5/56=55/616.\n\nSo, 30t/11 -5/56= (1680t -55)/616.\n\nThus, (30t/11 -5/56)^2= (1680t -55)^2 / (616)^2.\n\nSo, second term becomes:\n\n14*(1680t -55)^2 / (616)^2.\n\nSo, left side equation:\n\n[(110 -235 t)^2 ]/484 + [14*(1680t -55)^2 ]/ (616)^2 =78750/3136.\n\nMultiply both sides by 484*(616)^2 to eliminate denominators.\n\nBut that seems very cumbersome. Alternatively, perhaps we can find t such that t=0 corresponds to point A, and t=1 corresponds to point D.\n\nBut point P is another intersection, so t\u22600. Let's find t such that the parametric equations satisfy the circle equation.\n\nAlternatively, since A is on the circle, when t=0, the equation holds. So, the other solution will correspond to t\u22600.\n\nSo, expanding the equation:\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: (110 -235 t)^2 / (22)^2 = (110 -235t)^2 /484.\n\nSecond term:14*(30t/11 -5/56)^2=14*( (30t/11 -5/56)^2 ).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nCompute (110 -235 t)^2:\n\n=110\u00b2 -2*110*235 t + (235t)^2=12100 -51700 t +55225 t\u00b2.\n\nSo, first term: (12100 -51700 t +55225 t\u00b2)/484.\n\nSecond term:14*(30t/11 -5/56)^2.\n\nCompute inside the square:\n\n30t/11 -5/56= (30t*56 -5*11)/(11*56)= (1680t -55)/616.\n\nSo, squared: (1680t -55)^2 / (616)^2.\n\nThus, second term:14*(1680t -55)^2 / (616)^2.\n\nCompute numerator:14*(1680t -55)^2.\n\nDenominator:616\u00b2=379456.\n\nSo, second term: [14*(1680t -55)^2 ] /379456.\n\nNow, the equation is:\n\n(12100 -51700 t +55225 t\u00b2)/484 + [14*(1680t -55)^2 ] /379456 =78750/3136.\n\nMultiply all terms by 379456*484 to eliminate denominators.\n\nBut that would be a huge number. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to substitute t=1 and see if it satisfies, but t=1 is point D, which is outside the circle, so it won't satisfy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps find t such that the equation holds.\n\nBut this seems very involved. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps using power of point D with respect to \u03c9: DB\u00b2 = DP * DA.\n\nWe have DB as the length from D to B. Since D is the ex-tangent point, DB=DC.\n\nWe can compute DB using coordinates.\n\nPoint D is (-15/22,30\u221a14/11).\n\nPoint B is (39/5,6\u221a14/5).\n\nCompute distance DB:\n\nDB\u00b2= (39/5 +15/22)^2 + (6\u221a14/5 -30\u221a14/11)^2.\n\nCompute each term.\n\nFirst term:39/5 +15/22= (39*22 +15*5)/(5*22)= (858 +75)/110=933/110.\n\nSo, (933/110)^2= (933\u00b2)/(110\u00b2).\n\nCompute 933\u00b2: Let's compute 930\u00b2=864900, plus 2*930*3=5580, plus 3\u00b2=9. So, 864900+5580+9=870489.\n\nSo, (933)^2=870489.\n\nThus, (933/110)^2=870489/12100.\n\nSecond term:6\u221a14/5 -30\u221a14/11= (6\u221a14*11 -30\u221a14*5)/(5*11)= (66\u221a14 -150\u221a14)/55= (-84\u221a14)/55.\n\nSo, squared: (84\u00b2 *14)/(55\u00b2)= (7056 *14)/3025=98784/3025.\n\nSo, DB\u00b2=870489/12100 +98784/3025.\n\nConvert 98784/3025 to denominator 12100: multiply numerator and denominator by 4: 395136/12100.\n\nSo, DB\u00b2=870489/12100 +395136/12100= (870489+395136)/12100=1,265,625/12100.\n\nSimplify:1,265,625 \u00f725=50,625; 12100 \u00f725=484.\n\nSo, 50625/484.\n\nThus, DB\u00b2=50625/484.\n\nSo, the power of D is DB\u00b2=50625/484= DP * DA.\n\nWe can compute DA, the distance from D to A.\n\nPoint A is (10,0), point D is (-15/22,30\u221a14/11).\n\nCompute DA:\n\nDA\u00b2=(10 +15/22)^2 + (0 -30\u221a14/11)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n10 +15/22= (220 +15)/22=235/22.\n\nSo, (235/22)^2=55225/484.\n\nSecond term: (30\u221a14/11)^2=900*14/121=12600/121.\n\nSo, DA\u00b2=55225/484 +12600/121.\n\nConvert 12600/121 to denominator 484: multiply numerator and denominator by 4:50400/484.\n\nSo, DA\u00b2=55225/484 +50400/484=105625/484.\n\nThus, DA= sqrt(105625/484)=325/22.\n\nSo, DA=325/22.\n\nSo, from power of a point: DB\u00b2= DP * DA.\n\nWe have DB\u00b2=50625/484, DA=325/22.\n\nSo, DP= (50625/484)/(325/22)= (50625/484)*(22/325).\n\nSimplify:\n\n50625 \u00f7325=50625 \u00f725=2025; 2025 \u00f713=155.769\u2026 Wait, perhaps factor:\n\n50625= 50625=225\u00b2= (15\u00b2)\u00b2=15^4.\n\n325=5^2 *13.\n\nSo, 50625/325= (15^4)/(5^2 *13)= (3^4 *5^4)/(5^2 *13)=3^4 *5^2 /13=81*25/13=2025/13.\n\nSimilarly, 22/484=22/(22^2)=1/22.\n\nSo, DP= (2025/13)*(1/22)=2025/(13*22)=2025/286.\n\nSimplify 2025/286: 2025 \u00f713=155.769\u2026 Hmm, but 2025=45\u00b2= (9*5)^2=9\u00b2*5\u00b2=81*25. 286=2*11*13.\n\nSo, no common factors, so DP=2025/286.\n\nThen, since DA=325/22, AP= DA - DP? Wait, no, because DP is from D to P, and DA is from D to A. Since P is beyond A on the line AD, AP would be DA + DP?\n\nWait, no. Let me think. Point D is outside the circle, point A is on the circle, and P is the second intersection point on AD beyond A. So, the line goes D---A---P. So, DA is from D to A, and DP is from D to P, so DP = DA + AP.\n\nWait, no, because from D to A is DA, then from A to P is AP, so DP = DA + AP. So, AP= DP - DA.\n\nBut wait, power of point says DP * DA = DB\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, the power of point D is DP * DA = DB\u00b2. So, in this case, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P. So, if P is on the extension beyond A, then DP = DA + AP. So, the power of point D is DP * DA = DB\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, the power of a point outside the circle is equal to the product of the distances from the point to the intersection points along any secant line. So, in this case, D is outside, and AD is a secant line intersecting the circle at A and P. So, the power of D is DA * DP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, the correct formula is DA * DP = DB\u00b2. But depending on the notation, sometimes it's written as DP * DA, but it's actually DA * DP because DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is from D to P. But since A is between D and P, DP = DA + AP. So, DA * DP = DA*(DA + AP) = DB\u00b2.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as DP * DA = DB\u00b2. So, perhaps it's the same thing.\n\nSo, in any case, DA * DP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWe have DA=325/22, DB\u00b2=50625/484.\n\nSo, DP= DB\u00b2 / DA= (50625/484) / (325/22)= (50625/484)*(22/325).\n\nCompute this:\n\n50625 \u00f7325= (50625 \u00f725)=2025; 2025 \u00f713=155.769. Wait, let's factor:\n\n50625= 225\u00b2= (15\u00b2)\u00b2=15^4.\n\n325=5\u00b2 *13.\n\nSo, 50625 /325= (15^4)/(5\u00b2 *13)= (3^4 *5^4)/(5\u00b2 *13)= 3^4 *5\u00b2 /13=81*25/13=2025/13.\n\nSimilarly, 22/484=1/22.\n\nSo, DP= (2025/13)*(1/22)=2025/(13*22)=2025/286.\n\nSo, DP=2025/286.\n\nNow, AP is the distance from A to P.\n\nSince DP = DA + AP, then AP= DP - DA.\n\nBut DA=325/22, DP=2025/286.\n\nCompute 325/22 in terms of denominator 286: 22*13=286. So, 325/22= (325*13)/286=4225/286.\n\nSo, AP= DP - DA=2025/286 -4225/286= (2025 -4225)/286= (-2200)/286= -1100/143.\n\nWait, that can't be. Negative length doesn't make sense. So, perhaps my assumption about the direction is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps AP= DA - DP?\n\nWait, since P is beyond A from D, then DA is from D to A, and DP is from D to P, so DP= DA + AP.\n\nSo, AP= DP - DA.\n\nBut if DA=325/22\u224814.77, DP=2025/286\u22487.08. Wait, that can't be because DP is shorter than DA, which would mean P is between D and A, which contradicts the fact that A is on the circle and P is the second intersection.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the power of a point formula.\n\nWait, actually, the power of point D is equal to DB\u00b2= DC\u00b2= DP * DA.\n\nBut in this case, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P, but since P is on the extension beyond A, DP is longer than DA. So, actually, DP= DA + AP.\n\nBut in the power of a point formula, it's DA * DP = DB\u00b2, where DA is the length from D to A, and DP is from D to P.\n\nBut since A is on the circle, DA is the tangent length? Wait, no, DA is a secant.\n\nWait, no, the power of a point D outside the circle is equal to the product of the lengths from D to the two intersection points of any secant line through D. In this case, the secant is DAP, so DP * DA = DB\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, actually, the formula is DP * DA = DB\u00b2, but DP is the entire length from D to P, and DA is from D to A. Since P is beyond A, DP = DA + AP. So, DA * (DA + AP) = DB\u00b2.\n\nSo, DA^2 + DA * AP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWe have DA=325/22, DB\u00b2=50625/484.\n\nSo, (325/22)^2 + (325/22)*AP =50625/484.\n\nCompute (325/22)^2=105625/484.\n\nSo, 105625/484 + (325/22)*AP =50625/484.\n\nSubtract 105625/484 from both sides:\n\n(325/22)*AP = (50625 -105625)/484= (-55000)/484.\n\nSo, (325/22)*AP= -55000/484.\n\nMultiply both sides by 22/325:\n\nAP= (-55000/484)*(22/325)= (-55000*22)/(484*325).\n\nSimplify:\n\n55000=55*1000=5*11*1000.\n\n22=2*11.\n\n484=22\u00b2=4*121=4*11\u00b2.\n\n325=5\u00b2*13.\n\nSo,\n\nAP= (-5*11*1000 *2*11)/(4*11\u00b2 *5\u00b2 *13).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: (-5*11*1000 *2*11)= -5*2*11\u00b2*1000= -10*121*1000= -1210000.\n\nDenominator:4*11\u00b2*5\u00b2*13=4*121*25*13=4*121=484; 484*25=12100; 12100*13=157300.\n\nSo, AP= -1210000 /157300= -12100/1573.\n\nSimplify: Divide numerator and denominator by 121.\n\n12100 \u00f7121=100.\n\n1573 \u00f7121=13.\n\nSo, AP= -100/13.\n\nBut length can't be negative. So, absolute value: AP=100/13.\n\nSo, AP=100/13, which simplifies to 100/13. Since 100 and 13 are coprime, m=100, n=13, so m +n=113.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the answer is 100/13, so 100 +13=113.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that triangle \\(ABC\\) is inscribed in circle \\(\\omega\\). The tangents at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) intersect at point \\(D\\), and line \\(AD\\) intersects \\(\\omega\\) again at \\(P\\). Given \\(AB = 5\\), \\(BC = 9\\), and \\(AC = 10\\), we need to find \\(AP\\).\n\nFirst, we calculate the circumradius \\(R\\) of triangle \\(ABC\\) using the formula \\(R = \\frac{abc}{4\\Delta}\\), where \\(\\Delta\\) is the area of the triangle. Using Heron's formula, we find \\(\\Delta = 6\\sqrt{14}\\). Thus, \\(R = \\frac{75\\sqrt{14}}{56}\\).\n\nNext, we use coordinate geometry to find the coordinates of points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\). Placing \\(C\\) at the origin, \\(A\\) at \\((10, 0)\\), and calculating \\(B\\)'s coordinates, we find \\(B = \\left(\\frac{39}{5}, \\frac{6\\sqrt{14}}{5}\\right)\\).\n\nWe then determine the circumcenter \\(O\\) of triangle \\(ABC\\), which is found to be \\((5, \\frac{5\\sqrt{14}}{56})\\). Using the coordinates of \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), we derive the equations of the tangents at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\). Solving these, we find point \\(D\\) at \\(\\left(-\\frac{15}{22}, \\frac{30\\sqrt{14}}{11}\\right)\\).\n\nUsing the power of a point theorem, we know that \\(DB^2 = DP \\cdot DA\\). Calculating \\(DB\\) and \\(DA\\), we find \\(DB^2 = \\frac{50625}{484}\\) and \\(DA = \\frac{325}{22}\\). Solving for \\(DP\\), we find \\(DP = \\frac{2025}{286}\\).\n\nFinally, since \\(DP = DA + AP\\), we solve for \\(AP\\) and find \\(AP = \\frac{100}{13}\\). Thus, \\(m = 100\\) and \\(n = 13\\), giving \\(m + n = 113\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{113}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:\n\nLet ABC be a triangle inscribed in circle \u03c9. The tangents to \u03c9 at B and C intersect at point D. Then, line AD intersects \u03c9 again at point P. Given that AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10, I need to find the length of AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.\n\nHmm, okay. So, let's see. I know that ABC is a triangle with sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. First, maybe I should sketch a rough diagram to visualize what's going on. I have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle, so the circle is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, drawing line AD which intersects the circle again at P. So, P is the second intersection point of AD with the circumcircle.\n\nI remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point outside a circle, the lengths from that point to the points of tangency are equal. So, DB should be equal to DC because both are tangents from D to circle \u03c9.\n\nWait, so DB = DC. That might come in handy later. Also, since D is the intersection of the two tangents, it's called the exsymmedian point or something? Maybe not. Alternatively, D is the ex-pole of BC or something. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Maybe I can use some properties of harmonic division or projective geometry here. Alternatively, maybe using power of a point.\n\nPower of a point! Yes, that's a good idea. The power of point D with respect to circle \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 and DC\u00b2, since DB and DC are tangent lengths. So, power of D is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2. Also, since line AD passes through the circle, the power of D can also be expressed as DP * DA. Wait, no, power of a point outside the circle is equal to the product of the lengths from D to the two intersection points of any line through D and the circle. So, in this case, line DA intersects the circle at A and P, so power of D is DA * DP.\n\nSo, Power of D: DB\u00b2 = DA * DP.\n\nSo, if I can find DA, then I can find DP, and then since AP = DP - DA? Wait, no. Wait, AP is the length from A to P. Since A is on the circle, AP is just the chord from A to P. But DA is the segment from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So, if DA is extended beyond A to P, then AP = DP - DA? Wait, no, that's not right because P is on the opposite side from D. Wait, let me think.\n\nActually, if D is outside the circle, and DA is a secant that passes through the circle at A and then exits at P, then the power of point D is equal to DA * DP, where DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is from D to P. But since A is on the circle, DA is just the length from D to A, and DP is from D to P, but P is the other intersection point. So, the power of D is DB\u00b2 = DA * DP.\n\nWait, but actually, in the power of a point formula, if a line through D intersects the circle at two points X and Y, then DX * DY = power of D. In this case, the line is DA, which intersects the circle at A and P. So, DA * DP = DB\u00b2. But wait, is DP the length from D to P? Or is it from D to A and then to P?\n\nWait, let's clarify. The power of point D is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2. Also, for the secant line DP intersecting the circle at A and P, the power is DA * DP, where DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. But wait, that's not quite right because DP would be the entire length from D to P, which is DA plus AP if A is between D and P. But since D is outside the circle and A is on the circle, when you draw DA, it goes from D, through A, and then exits the circle at P. So, the two intersection points are A and P, so the lengths are DA and DP. Wait, no. The power formula is for the product of the entire secant segment and its external part. So, in this case, the external part is DA, and the entire secant is DP. So, the formula is DA * DP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's say D is outside, and from D, we draw a secant that passes through the circle at A and then exits at P. So, the distances are DA (from D to A) and DP (from D to P). But since A is between D and P, DP = DA + AP. Wait, no, because AP is from A to P, so DP would be DA + AP. So, the power of point D is DA * DP = DA * (DA + AP) = DB\u00b2.\n\nSo, if I can find DA, then I can solve for AP. Because DA * (DA + AP) = DB\u00b2.\n\nSo, AP = (DB\u00b2 / DA) - DA.\n\nSo, if I can compute DB and DA, then I can find AP.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute DA first. How can I find DA?\n\nHmm. Let's think about triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me compute some properties of triangle ABC. Maybe the circumradius, because D is related to the tangents at B and C.\n\nWait, the tangents at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole of BC. Alternatively, D is the exsymmedian point or something else. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe using coordinates or trigonometry.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the circumradius R of triangle ABC. Then, since DB and DC are equal to the tangent lengths, which can be computed as sqrt(R\u00b2 + OB\u00b2), where OB is the distance from the center to B? Wait, no, the tangent length from D to the circle is equal to sqrt(DO\u00b2 - R\u00b2), where O is the center of the circle.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to compute the circumradius R of triangle ABC. Let's try that.\n\nIn triangle ABC, sides are a=BC=9, b=AC=10, c=AB=5.\n\nWait, wait, in standard notation, a is BC, which is opposite to A, so a=9, b=AC=10 opposite to B, and c=AB=5 opposite to C.\n\nSo, using the formula for the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where \u0394 is the area of the triangle.\n\nSo, first, I need to compute the area \u0394 of triangle ABC.\n\nUsing Heron's formula: s = (a + b + c)/2 = (9 + 10 + 5)/2 = 24/2 = 12.\n\nSo, \u0394 = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12*(12 - 9)*(12 - 10)*(12 - 5)] = sqrt[12*3*2*7] = sqrt[504].\n\nSimplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5? Wait, no, 504 \u00f7 16 is 31.5, but 504 = 16 * 31.5? Hmm, perhaps better to factor 504.\n\n504: 504 \u00f7 2 = 252, \u00f72=126, \u00f72=63, which is 7*9. So, 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7.\n\nSo, sqrt(504) = sqrt(2^3 * 3^2 *7) = 2^(1.5) *3*sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). Wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 2^3 is 8, 3^2 is 9, and 7 is 7. So sqrt(8 * 9 *7) = sqrt(504). 8 = 4*2, so sqrt(4*2*9*7) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(9)*sqrt(2*7) = 2*3*sqrt(14) = 6*sqrt(14). Yes, so \u0394 = 6\u221a14.\n\nSo, the area is 6\u221a14. Then, the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4\u0394) = (5*9*10)/(4*6\u221a14).\n\nCompute numerator: 5*9=45, 45*10=450.\n\nDenominator: 4*6=24, 24\u221a14.\n\nSo, R = 450 / (24\u221a14) = (450)/(24\u221a14).\n\nSimplify 450/24: both divide by 6: 75/4.\n\nSo, R = (75)/(4\u221a14). Rationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14.\n\nR = (75\u221a14)/(4*14) = (75\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo, R = 75\u221a14 / 56.\n\nOkay, so now I have R, the circumradius.\n\nNow, let's think about point D, the intersection of the tangents at B and C. So, point D lies outside the circle, and DB and DC are tangent to the circle. So, DB = DC = sqrt(OD\u00b2 - R\u00b2), where O is the center of the circle.\n\nBut wait, I don't know the location of O. Hmm, perhaps it's better to use coordinate geometry here. Let me set up a coordinate system.\n\nLet me place point C at the origin (0,0), and point A at (10,0), since AC=10. Then, point B will be somewhere in the plane. Given that AB=5 and BC=9, I can find the coordinates of point B.\n\nSo, point C is at (0,0), point A is at (10,0). Let me denote point B as (x,y). Then, the distance from A to B is 5: sqrt[(x - 10)^2 + y^2] = 5, so (x -10)^2 + y^2 = 25.\n\nDistance from B to C is 9: sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 9, so x^2 + y^2 = 81.\n\nSo, I have two equations:\n\n1. (x -10)^2 + y^2 = 25\n2. x^2 + y^2 = 81\n\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n(x -10)^2 + y^2 - x^2 - y^2 = 25 - 81 => (x\u00b2 -20x +100) - x\u00b2 = -56 => -20x + 100 = -56 => -20x = -156 => x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.\n\nSo, x = 39/5. Then, plug back into equation 2: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 81.\n\nx = 39/5, so x\u00b2 = (39/5)^2 = 1521/25. So, y\u00b2 = 81 - 1521/25 = (2025/25 - 1521/25) = 504/25. So, y = sqrt(504/25) = (sqrt(504))/5. We already saw that sqrt(504)=6*sqrt(14), so y = 6\u221a14 /5.\n\nSo, coordinates of B are (39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo, now, points:\n\nA: (10,0)\n\nB: (39/5, 6\u221a14/5)\n\nC: (0,0)\n\nNow, I need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nHmm, tangents at B and C. The tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, and the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC.\n\nSo, if I can find the equations of the tangents at B and C, then their intersection will be point D.\n\nFirst, I need the coordinates of the center O of the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nSince the circumcircle passes through A, B, C, with coordinates known, I can find O by finding the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC and finding their intersection.\n\nWait, but actually, since I already have the circumradius R and the coordinates, maybe it's easier to compute O.\n\nAlternatively, since I have the coordinates of A, B, C, I can compute O using perpendicular bisectors.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nThe circumcircle's center O is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.\n\nLet me compute the midpoint and slope of AB and AC.\n\nFirst, AB: points A(10,0) and B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nCompute midpoint M1 of AB: x-coordinate: (10 + 39/5)/2 = (50/5 + 39/5)/2 = (89/5)/2 = 89/10 = 8.9.\n\ny-coordinate: (0 + 6\u221a14/5)/2 = (6\u221a14/5)/2 = 3\u221a14/5.\n\nSo, midpoint M1 is (89/10, 3\u221a14/5).\n\nSlope of AB: (yB - yA)/(xB - xA) = (6\u221a14/5 - 0)/(39/5 - 10) = (6\u221a14/5)/(39/5 - 50/5) = (6\u221a14/5)/(-11/5) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nSo, the perpendicular bisector of AB will have slope reciprocal and opposite: m1 = 11/(6\u221a14).\n\nSimilarly, compute the perpendicular bisector of AC.\n\nPoints A(10,0) and C(0,0). Midpoint M2 is (5,0).\n\nSlope of AC: (0 - 0)/(0 -10) = 0. So, the line AC is horizontal. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector is vertical, with undefined slope. So, the perpendicular bisector of AC is the vertical line x=5.\n\nSo, the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC intersect at O.\n\nWe have the perpendicular bisector of AB: passes through M1 (89/10, 3\u221a14/5) and has slope 11/(6\u221a14).\n\nLet me write the equation of this perpendicular bisector.\n\nUsing point-slope form: y - y1 = m(x - x1), where (x1, y1) is M1.\n\nSo, y - (3\u221a14/5) = (11/(6\u221a14))(x - 89/10).\n\nNow, the perpendicular bisector of AC is x=5. So, substituting x=5 into the above equation will give the y-coordinate of O.\n\nSo, plug x=5 into the equation:\n\ny - (3\u221a14/5) = (11/(6\u221a14))(5 - 89/10).\n\nCompute 5 - 89/10: 5 is 50/10, so 50/10 - 89/10 = (-39/10).\n\nSo,\n\ny - (3\u221a14/5) = (11/(6\u221a14))*(-39/10) = (-429)/(60\u221a14) = (-143)/(20\u221a14).\n\nSo, y = 3\u221a14/5 - 143/(20\u221a14).\n\nLet me rationalize the second term:\n\n143/(20\u221a14) = (143\u221a14)/(20*14) = (143\u221a14)/(280).\n\nSimilarly, 3\u221a14/5 = (3\u221a14 *56)/280 = 168\u221a14/280.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, 3\u221a14/5 is equal to (3\u221a14 * 56)/280 because 5 * 56 = 280. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let's see:\n\nWait, 3\u221a14/5 = (3\u221a14 * 56)/280 because 56 is 280/5. So, 3\u221a14/5 = (3\u221a14 * 56)/280 = (168\u221a14)/280.\n\nSimilarly, 143\u221a14/280 is the other term.\n\nSo, y = (168\u221a14)/280 - (143\u221a14)/280 = (168\u221a14 - 143\u221a14)/280 = (25\u221a14)/280 = (5\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo, the center O is at (5, 5\u221a14/56).\n\nWait, that seems really close to the x-axis. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, when I computed y = 3\u221a14/5 - 143/(20\u221a14), I think I made a mistake in the rationalization.\n\nWait, let's do it again.\n\nFirst, 3\u221a14/5 is the first term.\n\nSecond term: 143/(20\u221a14). Let's rationalize this:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14: 143\u221a14 / (20 * 14) = 143\u221a14 / 280.\n\nSo, y = 3\u221a14/5 - 143\u221a14/280.\n\nConvert 3\u221a14/5 to 280 denominator:\n\n3\u221a14/5 = (3\u221a14 * 56)/280 = 168\u221a14 / 280.\n\nSo, y = (168\u221a14 - 143\u221a14)/280 = (25\u221a14)/280 = 5\u221a14/56.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, center O is at (5, 5\u221a14/56).\n\nHmm, okay. Now, with O known, I can find the equations of the tangents at B and C.\n\nLet's start with tangent at C. Since C is at (0,0), and the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC. The slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56 - 0)/(5 - 0) = (5\u221a14/56)/5 = \u221a14/56.\n\nSo, the slope of OC is \u221a14/56. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is the negative reciprocal: -56/\u221a14.\n\nSimplify -56/\u221a14: 56 = 14 *4, so 56/\u221a14 = (14*4)/\u221a14 = 4\u221a14.\n\nSo, the slope is -4\u221a14.\n\nSo, the tangent at C passes through C (0,0) and has slope -4\u221a14. So, its equation is y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSimilarly, find the tangent at B.\n\nPoint B is at (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). The tangent at B is perpendicular to OB.\n\nSlope of OB: (5\u221a14/56 - 6\u221a14/5)/(5 - 39/5).\n\nWait, let's compute the slope.\n\nFirst, coordinates of O: (5, 5\u221a14/56).\n\nCoordinates of B: (39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo, slope of OB is (yB - yO)/(xB - xO).\n\nCompute yB - yO: (6\u221a14/5) - (5\u221a14/56) = (6\u221a14 *56 -5\u221a14*5)/(5*56) = (336\u221a14 -25\u221a14)/280 = (311\u221a14)/280.\n\nSimilarly, xB - xO: 39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5 = 14/5.\n\nSo, slope of OB is (311\u221a14/280)/(14/5) = (311\u221a14/280) * (5/14) = (311\u221a14 *5)/(280 *14) = (1555\u221a14)/(3920).\n\nSimplify: 1555 and 3920, let's see if they have a common factor. 1555 \u00f75=311, 3920 \u00f75=784. So, 311\u221a14/784.\n\nSo, slope of OB is 311\u221a14/784.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal: -784/(311\u221a14).\n\nSimplify this: let's rationalize the denominator.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14: -784\u221a14/(311*14) = -784\u221a14/(4354).\n\nSimplify 784 and 4354: Let's see, 784 \u00f714=56, 4354 \u00f714=311. So, 784=14*56, 4354=14*311.\n\nSo, -784\u221a14/(14*311) = -56\u221a14/311.\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent at B is -56\u221a14/311.\n\nNow, we can write the equation of the tangent at B.\n\nUsing point B (39/5, 6\u221a14/5) and slope m = -56\u221a14/311.\n\nEquation: y - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5).\n\nNow, we have two tangent equations: tangent at C is y = -4\u221a14 x, and tangent at B is y - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5).\n\nThe intersection point D of these two tangents can be found by solving these two equations.\n\nSo, let's set up the system:\n\n1. y = -4\u221a14 x\n\n2. y - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5)\n\nSubstitute equation 1 into equation 2:\n\n-4\u221a14 x - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5)\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14 from all terms:\n\n\u221a14 [ -4x - 6/5 ] = \u221a14 [ (-56/311)(x - 39/5) ]\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a14:\n\n-4x - 6/5 = (-56/311)(x - 39/5)\n\nNow, let's write this as:\n\n-4x - 6/5 = (-56/311)x + (56/311)*(39/5)\n\nCompute the right-hand side:\n\nFirst, (56/311)*(39/5) = (56*39)/(311*5) = (2184)/(1555).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n-4x - 6/5 = (-56/311)x + 2184/1555\n\nLet me collect like terms. Move all terms to the left:\n\n-4x + (56/311)x -6/5 -2184/1555 = 0\n\nCompute the coefficients:\n\nFor x terms:\n\n-4x + (56/311)x = (-4*(311/311) + 56/311)x = [ (-1244 + 56)/311 ]x = (-1188/311)x.\n\nConstant terms:\n\n-6/5 - 2184/1555.\n\nConvert to common denominator 1555:\n\n-6/5 = (-6 * 311)/1555 = (-1866)/1555.\n\nSo, -1866/1555 -2184/1555 = (-1866 -2184)/1555 = (-4050)/1555.\n\nSimplify: -4050/1555. Both divide by 5: -810/311.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(-1188/311)x - 810/311 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 311:\n\n-1188x -810 = 0\n\nSo, -1188x = 810 => x = 810 / (-1188) = -810/1188.\n\nSimplify the fraction: 810 and 1188 are both divisible by 9.\n\n810 \u00f79=90, 1188 \u00f79=132.\n\n90 and 132 are both divisible by 6.\n\n90 \u00f76=15, 132 \u00f76=22.\n\nSo, x = -15/22.\n\nSo, x = -15/22.\n\nNow, find y using equation 1: y = -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22) = (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nOkay, now I have coordinates for D. Now, I need to find the equation of line AD, which connects A(10,0) and D(-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nCompute the slope of AD.\n\nSlope m_AD = (yD - yA)/(xD - xA) = (30\u221a14/11 - 0)/( -15/22 -10 ) = (30\u221a14/11)/( -15/22 - 220/22 ) = (30\u221a14/11)/(-235/22) = (30\u221a14/11) * (-22/235) = (30\u221a14 * -22)/(11 *235).\n\nSimplify:\n\n30 and 235: 30 and 235 share a factor of 5: 30=5*6, 235=5*47.\n\nSimilarly, 22 and 11: 22=2*11.\n\nSo,\n\n(30\u221a14 * -22)/(11*235) = ( (5*6)\u221a14 * (-2*11) ) / (11*5*47) ) = (5*6*(-2)*11\u221a14)/(5*11*47) ).\n\nCancel out 5, 11:\n\n= (6*(-2)\u221a14)/47 = (-12\u221a14)/47.\n\nSo, the slope of AD is -12\u221a14/47.\n\nNow, the equation of AD: using point A(10,0):\n\ny - 0 = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nSo, y = (-12\u221a14/47)x + 120\u221a14/47.\n\nNow, this line AD intersects the circumcircle \u03c9 again at point P. We need to find the coordinates of P.\n\nSince point A is already on the circle and on line AD, P is the other intersection point. So, to find P, we can solve the equation of line AD with the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nThe equation of the circumcircle \u03c9: since it passes through A(10,0), B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5), and C(0,0), and its center is at O(5,5\u221a14/56), the equation is:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (y - 5\u221a14/56)^2 = R^2.\n\nWe have R = 75\u221a14/56, so R^2 = (75^2 *14)/(56^2).\n\nCompute R^2:\n\n75^2 = 5625, 56^2 = 3136.\n\nSo, R^2 = (5625 *14)/3136.\n\nCompute 5625 *14: 5625*10=56250, 5625*4=22500; total 56250+22500=78750.\n\nSo, R^2 = 78750 / 3136.\n\nSimplify: Let's see, 78750 \u00f7 14 = 5625, 3136 \u00f714=224.\n\nSo, 5625/224. So, R\u00b2 = 5625/224.\n\nSo, the equation of the circle is:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (y - 5\u221a14/56)^2 = 5625/224.\n\nNow, substitute y from the equation of AD into the circle equation.\n\nFrom AD: y = (-12\u221a14/47)x + 120\u221a14/47.\n\nPlug into the circle equation:\n\n(x -5)^2 + [ (-12\u221a14/47 x + 120\u221a14/47 ) - 5\u221a14/56 ]^2 = 5625/224.\n\nThis looks complicated, but let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, expand (x -5)^2: x\u00b2 -10x +25.\n\nNow, the second term: [ (-12\u221a14/47 x + 120\u221a14/47 ) - 5\u221a14/56 ].\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (-12/47 x + 120/47 ) -5/56 ].\n\nCompute the terms inside the brackets:\n\nCompute (-12/47 x + 120/47 -5/56).\n\nTo combine 120/47 and -5/56, find a common denominator. 47 and 56 are coprime, so LCD is 47*56=2632.\n\nConvert 120/47 = (120*56)/2632 = 6720/2632.\n\nConvert -5/56 = (-5*47)/2632 = -235/2632.\n\nSo, 120/47 -5/56 = 6720/2632 -235/2632 = (6720 -235)/2632 = 6485/2632.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\u221a14 [ (-12/47 x) + 6485/2632 ].\n\nFactor out 1/2632:\n\n= \u221a14 [ (-12*56 x +6485)/2632 ].\n\nWait, because 47*56=2632. So, to combine the terms, multiply numerator and denominator:\n\n-12/47 x = (-12*56 x)/2632 = (-672x)/2632.\n\nSo, -672x/2632 +6485/2632 = ( -672x +6485 ) /2632.\n\nSo, the second term is \u221a14*( -672x +6485 ) /2632.\n\nSo, the second term squared is [ \u221a14*( -672x +6485 ) /2632 ]^2 = 14*( -672x +6485 )\u00b2 / (2632)^2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the circle equation becomes:\n\n(x\u00b2 -10x +25) + [14*( -672x +6485 )\u00b2 ]/(2632)^2 = 5625/224.\n\nThis looks very messy, but perhaps I can substitute t = x, and solve for x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the line AD and find its other intersection with the circle.\n\nWait, another approach: since A is on both the line AD and the circle, when I plug the parametric equation of AD into the circle equation, I should get a quadratic equation in parameter t, with one root at A and the other at P.\n\nSo, let me parametrize line AD. Let me let t be a parameter such that when t=0, we are at A(10,0), and when t=1, we are at D(-15/22, 30\u221a14/11). Wait, but actually, since I need to find P beyond D, maybe t should go beyond D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a parameter s where point A corresponds to s=0 and point D corresponds to s=1, but then P is at some s>1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to parametrize in terms of distance from A. Let me let the parametric equations be:\n\nx = 10 + t*( (-15/22) -10 ) = 10 + t*(-235/22 )\n\ny = 0 + t*(30\u221a14/11 -0 ) = t*(30\u221a14/11 )\n\nSo, x = 10 - (235/22) t\n\ny = (30\u221a14/11 ) t\n\nNow, plug these into the circle equation:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (y - 5\u221a14/56)^2 = 5625/224.\n\nSubstitute x and y:\n\n(10 - (235/22)t -5)^2 + ( (30\u221a14/11 ) t -5\u221a14/56 )^2 = 5625/224.\n\nSimplify each term.\n\nFirst term: (5 - (235/22)t)^2.\n\nSecond term: (30\u221a14/11 t -5\u221a14/56 )^2.\n\nFactor out \u221a14 in the second term:\n\n\u221a14 (30/11 t -5/56 )^2.\n\nSo, second term becomes 14*(30/11 t -5/56 )^2.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n[5 - (235/22)t]^2 + 14*(30/11 t -5/56 )^2 = 5625/224.\n\nNow, let's expand each squared term.\n\nFirst term: [5 - (235/22)t]^2 = 25 - 2*5*(235/22)t + (235/22)^2 t\u00b2.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n25\n\n-2*5*(235/22) = -2*5*235/22 = -2350/22 = -1175/11.\n\n(235/22)^2 = (235)^2 / (22)^2. 235^2 = 55225, 22\u00b2=484. So, 55225/484.\n\nSo, first term expansion: 25 - (1175/11)t + (55225/484)t\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: 14*(30/11 t -5/56 )^2.\n\nCompute inside the square: 30/11 t -5/56.\n\nLet me compute (30/11 t -5/56 )^2 = (30/11 t)^2 - 2*(30/11 t)*(5/56) + (5/56)^2.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n(30/11 t)^2 = 900/121 t\u00b2.\n\n-2*(30/11)*(5/56) t = -2*(150)/(616) t = -300/616 t = -75/154 t.\n\n(5/56)^2 =25/3136.\n\nSo, inside squared term: 900/121 t\u00b2 -75/154 t +25/3136.\n\nMultiply by 14: 14*(900/121 t\u00b2 -75/154 t +25/3136 ) = (14*900)/121 t\u00b2 - (14*75)/154 t + (14*25)/3136.\n\nCompute each:\n\n14*900=12600, so 12600/121 t\u00b2.\n\n14*75=1050, 1050/154 = 1050 \u00f714=75, 154 \u00f714=11. So, 75/11 t.\n\n14*25=350, 350/3136=350 \u00f7 49=7.142... Wait, 350/3136=350 \u00f7 3136= divide numerator and denominator by 14: 25/224.\n\nSo, second term expansion: 12600/121 t\u00b2 - 75/11 t +25/224.\n\nNow, combine both expanded terms into the equation:\n\nFirst term: 25 - (1175/11)t + (55225/484)t\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: 12600/121 t\u00b2 -75/11 t +25/224.\n\nSum:\n\n25 +25/224 - (1175/11 +75/11 )t + (55225/484 +12600/121 )t\u00b2 = 5625/224.\n\nCompute each part:\n\nConstants: 25 +25/224.\n\nConvert 25 to 224 denominator: 25 = 25*224/224 =5600/224.\n\nSo, 5600/224 +25/224 =5625/224.\n\nLinear terms: -(1175/11 +75/11 )t = -(1250/11 )t.\n\nQuadratic terms: (55225/484 +12600/121 )t\u00b2.\n\nConvert 12600/121 to 484 denominator: 121*4=484, so 12600*4=50400. So, 50400/484.\n\nSo, 55225/484 +50400/484 = (55225 +50400)/484 =105625/484.\n\nSo, quadratic term: 105625/484 t\u00b2.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n5625/224 - (1250/11 )t + (105625/484 )t\u00b2 = 5625/224.\n\nSubtract 5625/224 from both sides:\n\n- (1250/11 )t + (105625/484 )t\u00b2 =0.\n\nFactor out t:\n\nt*( -1250/11 + (105625/484 )t ) =0.\n\nSo, solutions are t=0 and t= (1250/11 ) / (105625/484 ).\n\nSimplify t:\n\nt= (1250/11 ) * (484/105625 )= (1250 *484 )/(11 *105625 ).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n1250=125*10, 484=4*121, 11 is prime, 105625=100*1056.25? Wait, 105625 \u00f725=4225, which is 65\u00b2. 105625=25*4225=25*65\u00b2.\n\nWait, but 105625= 325\u00b2? Let me check 325\u00b2=105625? 300\u00b2=90000, 325\u00b2= (300+25)^2=90000 + 15000 +625=105625. Yes, so 105625=325\u00b2.\n\nSo, 484=22\u00b2, 1250=2*5^4, 11 is prime, 325=5^2*13.\n\nSo, t= (1250 *484 )/(11 *105625 )= (2*5^4 *22\u00b2 )/(11*5\u00b2*13\u00b2).\n\nSimplify:\n\n2 remains.\n\n5^4 /5\u00b2=5\u00b2=25.\n\n22\u00b2= (2*11)^2=4*121.\n\nDenominator:11*5\u00b2*13\u00b2=11*25*169.\n\nSo,\n\nt= [2 *25 *4 *121 ] / [11 *25 *169 ].\n\nCancel 25 in numerator and denominator.\n\nt= [2 *4 *121 ] / [11 *169 ].\n\n121=11\u00b2, 169=13\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nt= (8 *11\u00b2 )/(11 *13\u00b2 )= (8 *11 )/(13\u00b2 )= 88/169.\n\nSo, t=88/169.\n\nSo, the parameter t=88/169 corresponds to point P.\n\nSo, coordinates of P:\n\nx=10 - (235/22 )*(88/169 )\n\nCompute 235/22 *88/169:\n\n235/22 *88=235*(88/22)=235*(4)=940.\n\nSo, 940/169.\n\nSo, x=10 -940/169.\n\nConvert 10 to 169 denominator: 10=1690/169.\n\nSo, x=1690/169 -940/169=750/169.\n\nSimilarly, y=(30\u221a14/11 )*(88/169 ).\n\nCompute 30/11 *88=30*8=240.\n\nSo, y=240\u221a14 /169.\n\nSo, point P is at (750/169, 240\u221a14/169 ).\n\nNow, we need to compute AP.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), point P is at (750/169, 240\u221a14/169 ).\n\nCompute the distance between A and P.\n\nAP = sqrt[ (750/169 -10)^2 + (240\u221a14/169 -0)^2 ].\n\nFirst, compute 750/169 -10: 750/169 -1690/169= (750-1690)/169= (-940)/169.\n\nSo, the x-component is (-940/169).\n\nThe y-component is 240\u221a14/169.\n\nSo,\n\nAP\u00b2 = ( (-940/169)^2 ) + ( (240\u221a14/169)^2 )\n\n= (940\u00b2)/(169\u00b2) + (240\u00b2 *14)/(169\u00b2 )\n\nFactor out 1/(169\u00b2):\n\n= [940\u00b2 +240\u00b2 *14 ] /169\u00b2.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n940\u00b2: 940*940.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:\n\nLet ABC be a triangle inscribed in circle \u03c9. The tangents to \u03c9 at B and C intersect at point D. Then, line AD intersects \u03c9 again at point P. Given that AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10, I need to find the length of AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.\n\nHmm, okay. So, let's see. I know that ABC is a triangle with sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. First, maybe I should sketch a rough diagram to visualize what's going on. I have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle, so the circle is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, drawing line AD which intersects the circle again at P. So, P is the second intersection point of AD with the circumcircle.\n\nI remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point outside a circle, the lengths from that point to the points of tangency are equal. So, DB should be equal to DC because both are tangents from D to circle \u03c9.\n\nWait, so DB = DC. That might come in handy later. Also, since D is the intersection of the two tangents, it's called the exsymmedian point or something? Maybe not. Alternatively, D is the ex-pole of BC or something. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Maybe I can use some properties of harmonic division or projective geometry here. Alternatively, maybe using power of a point.\n\nPower of a point! Yes, that's a good idea. The power of point D with respect to circle \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 and DC\u00b2, since DB and DC are tangent lengths. So, power of D is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2. Also, since line AD passes through the circle, the power of D can also be expressed as DP * DA. Wait, no, power of a point outside the circle is equal to the product of the lengths from D to the two intersection points of any line through D and the circle. So, in this case, line DA intersects the circle at A and P, so power of D is DA * DP.\n\nSo, Power of D: DB\u00b2 = DA * DP.\n\nSo, if I can find DA, then I can find DP, and then since AP = DP - DA? Wait, no. Wait, AP is the length from A to P. Since A is on the circle, AP is just the chord from A to P. But DA is the segment from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So, if DA is extended beyond A to P, then AP = DP - DA? Wait, no, that's not right because P is on the opposite side from D. Wait, let me think.\n\nActually, if D is outside the circle, and DA is a secant that passes through the circle at A and then exits at P, then the power of point D is equal to DA * DP, where DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is from D to P. But since A is on the circle, DA is just the length from D to A, and DP is from D to P, but P is the other intersection point. So, the power of D is DB\u00b2 = DA * DP.\n\nWait, but actually, in the power of a point formula, if a line through D intersects the circle at two points X and Y, then DX * DY = power of D. In this case, the line is DA, which intersects the circle at A and P. So, DA * DP = DB\u00b2. But wait, is DP the length from D to P? Or is it from D to A and then to P?\n\nWait, let's clarify. The power of point D is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2. Also, for the secant line DP intersecting the circle at A and P, the power is DA * DP, where DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. But wait, that's not quite right because DP would be the entire length from D to P, which is DA plus AP if A is between D and P. But since D is outside the circle and A is on the circle, when you draw DA, it goes from D, through A, and then exits the circle at P. So, the two intersection points are A and P, so the lengths are DA and DP. Wait, no. The power formula is for the product of the entire secant segment and its external part. So, in this case, the external part is DA, and the entire secant is DP. So, the formula is DA * DP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's say D is outside, and from D, we draw a secant that passes through the circle at A and then exits at P. So, the distances are DA (from D to A) and DP (from D to P). But since A is between D and P, DP = DA + AP. Wait, no, because AP is from A to P, so DP would be DA + AP. So, the power of point D is DA * DP = DA * (DA + AP) = DB\u00b2.\n\nSo, if I can find DA, then I can solve for AP. Because DA * (DA + AP) = DB\u00b2.\n\nSo, AP = (DB\u00b2 / DA) - DA.\n\nSo, if I can compute DB and DA, then I can find AP.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute DA first. How can I find DA?\n\nHmm. Let's think about triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me compute some properties of triangle ABC. Maybe the circumradius, because D is related to the tangents at B and C.\n\nWait, the tangents at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole of BC. Alternatively, D is the exsymmedian point or something else. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe using coordinates or trigonometry.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the circumradius R of triangle ABC. Then, since DB and DC are equal to the tangent lengths, which can be computed as sqrt(R\u00b2 + OB\u00b2), where OB is the distance from the center to B? Wait, no, the tangent length from D to the circle is equal to sqrt(DO\u00b2 - R\u00b2), where O is the center of the circle.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to compute the circumradius R of triangle ABC. Let's try that.\n\nIn triangle ABC, sides are a=BC=9, b=AC=10, c=AB=5.\n\nWait, wait, in standard notation, a is BC, which is opposite to A, so a=9, b=AC=10 opposite to B, and c=AB=5 opposite to C.\n\nSo, using the formula for the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where \u0394 is the area of the triangle.\n\nSo, first, I need to compute the area \u0394 of triangle ABC.\n\nUsing Heron's formula: s = (a + b + c)/2 = (9 + 10 + 5)/2 = 24/2 = 12.\n\nSo, \u0394 = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12*(12 - 9)*(12 - 10)*(12 - 5)] = sqrt[12*3*2*7] = sqrt[504].\n\nSimplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5? Wait, no, 504 \u00f7 16 is 31.5, but 504 = 16 * 31.5? Hmm, perhaps better to factor 504.\n\n504: 504 \u00f7 2 = 252, \u00f72=126, \u00f72=63, which is 7*9. So, 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7.\n\nSo, sqrt(504) = sqrt(2^3 * 3^2 *7) = 2^(1.5) *3*sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). Wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 2^3 is 8, 3^2 is 9, and 7 is 7. So sqrt(8 * 9 *7) = sqrt(504). 8 = 4*2, so sqrt(4*2*9*7) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(9)*sqrt(2*7) = 2*3*sqrt(14) = 6*sqrt(14). Yes, so \u0394 = 6\u221a14.\n\nSo, the area is 6\u221a14. Then, the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4\u0394) = (5*9*10)/(4*6\u221a14).\n\nCompute numerator: 5*9=45, 45*10=450.\n\nDenominator: 4*6=24, 24\u221a14.\n\nSo, R = 450 / (24\u221a14) = (450)/(24\u221a14).\n\nSimplify 450/24: both divide by 6: 75/4.\n\nSo, R = (75)/(4\u221a14). Rationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14.\n\nR = (75\u221a14)/(4*14) = (75\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo, R = 75\u221a14 / 56.\n\nOkay, so now I have R, the circumradius.\n\nNow, let's think about point D, the intersection of the tangents at B and C. So, point D lies outside the circle, and DB and DC are tangent to the circle. So, DB = DC = sqrt(OD\u00b2 - R\u00b2), where O is the center of the circle.\n\nBut wait, I don't know the location of O. Hmm, perhaps it's better to use coordinate geometry here. Let me set up a coordinate system.\n\nLet me place point C at the origin (0,0), and point A at (10,0), since AC=10. Then, point B will be somewhere in the plane. Given that AB=5 and BC=9, I can find the coordinates of point B.\n\nSo, point C is at (0,0), point A is at (10,0). Let me denote point B as (x,y). Then, the distance from A to B is 5: sqrt[(x - 10)^2 + y^2] = 5, so (x -10)^2 + y^2 = 25.\n\nDistance from B to C is 9: sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 9, so x^2 + y^2 = 81.\n\nSo, I have two equations:\n\n1. (x -10)^2 + y^2 = 25\n2. x^2 + y^2 = 81\n\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n(x -10)^2 + y^2 - x^2 - y^2 = 25 - 81 => (x\u00b2 -20x +100) - x\u00b2 = -56 => -20x + 100 = -56 => -20x = -156 => x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.\n\nSo, x = 39/5. Then, plug back into equation 2: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 81.\n\nx = 39/5, so x\u00b2 = (39/5)^2 = 1521/25. So, y\u00b2 = 81 - 1521/25 = (2025/25 - 1521/25) = 504/25. So, y = sqrt(504/25) = (sqrt(504))/5. We already saw that sqrt(504)=6*sqrt(14), so y = 6\u221a14 /5.\n\nSo, coordinates of B are (39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo, now, points:\n\nA: (10,0)\n\nB: (39/5, 6\u221a14/5)\n\nC: (0,0)\n\nNow, I need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nHmm, tangents at B and C. The tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, and the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC.\n\nSo, if I can find the equations of the tangents at B and C, then their intersection will be point D.\n\nFirst, I need the coordinates of the center O of the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nSince the circumcircle passes through A, B, C, with coordinates known, I can find O by finding the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC and finding their intersection.\n\nWait, but actually, since I already have the circumradius R and the coordinates, maybe it's easier to compute O.\n\nAlternatively, since I have the coordinates of A, B, C, I can compute O using perpendicular bisectors.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nThe circumcircle's center O is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.\n\nLet me compute the midpoint and slope of AB and AC.\n\nFirst, AB: points A(10,0) and B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nCompute midpoint M1 of AB: x-coordinate: (10 + 39/5)/2 = (50/5 + 39/5)/2 = (89/5)/2 = 89/10 = 8.9.\n\ny-coordinate: (0 + 6\u221a14/5)/2 = (6\u221a14/5)/2 = 3\u221a14/5.\n\nSo, midpoint M1 is (89/10, 3\u221a14/5).\n\nSlope of AB: (yB - yA)/(xB - xA) = (6\u221a14/5 - 0)/(39/5 - 10) = (6\u221a14/5)/(39/5 - 50/5) = (6\u221a14/5)/(-11/5) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nSo, the perpendicular bisector of AB will have slope reciprocal and opposite: m1 = 11/(6\u221a14).\n\nSimilarly, compute the perpendicular bisector of AC.\n\nPoints A(10,0) and C(0,0). Midpoint M2 is (5,0).\n\nSlope of AC: (0 - 0)/(0 -10) = 0. So, the line AC is horizontal. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector is vertical, with undefined slope. So, the perpendicular bisector of AC is the vertical line x=5.\n\nSo, the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC intersect at O.\n\nWe have the perpendicular bisector of AB: passes through M1 (89/10, 3\u221a14/5) and has slope 11/(6\u221a14).\n\nLet me write the equation of this perpendicular bisector.\n\nUsing point-slope form: y - y1 = m(x - x1), where (x1, y1) is M1.\n\nSo, y - (3\u221a14/5) = (11/(6\u221a14))(x - 89/10).\n\nNow, the perpendicular bisector of AC is x=5. So, substituting x=5 into the above equation will give the y-coordinate of O.\n\nSo, plug x=5 into the equation:\n\ny - (3\u221a14/5) = (11/(6\u221a14))(5 - 89/10).\n\nCompute 5 - 89/10: 5 is 50/10, so 50/10 - 89/10 = (-39/10).\n\nSo,\n\ny - (3\u221a14/5) = (11/(6\u221a14))*(-39/10) = (-429)/(60\u221a14) = (-143)/(20\u221a14).\n\nSo, y = 3\u221a14/5 - 143/(20\u221a14).\n\nLet me rationalize the second term:\n\n143/(20\u221a14) = (143\u221a14)/(20*14) = (143\u221a14)/(280).\n\nSimilarly, 3\u221a14/5 = (3\u221a14 *56)/280 = 168\u221a14/280.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, 3\u221a14/5 is equal to (3\u221a14 * 56)/280 because 5 * 56 = 280. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let's see:\n\nWait, 3\u221a14/5 = (3\u221a14 * 56)/280 because 56 is 280/5. So, 3\u221a14/5 = (3\u221a14 * 56)/280 = (168\u221a14)/280.\n\nSimilarly, 143\u221a14/280 is the other term.\n\nSo, y = (168\u221a14)/280 - (143\u221a14)/280 = (168\u221a14 - 143\u221a14)/280 = (25\u221a14)/280 = (5\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo, the center O is at (5, 5\u221a14/56).\n\nWait, that seems really close to the x-axis. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, when I computed y = 3\u221a14/5 - 143/(20\u221a14), I think I made a mistake in the rationalization.\n\nWait, let's do it again.\n\nFirst, 3\u221a14/5 is the first term.\n\nSecond term: 143/(20\u221a14). Let's rationalize this:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14: 143\u221a14 / (20 * 14) = 143\u221a14 / 280.\n\nSo, y = 3\u221a14/5 - 143\u221a14/280.\n\nConvert 3\u221a14/5 to 280 denominator:\n\n3\u221a14/5 = (3\u221a14 * 56)/280 = 168\u221a14 / 280.\n\nSo, y = (168\u221a14 - 143\u221a14)/280 = (25\u221a14)/280 = 5\u221a14/56.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, center O is at (5, 5\u221a14/56).\n\nHmm, okay. Now, with O known, I can find the equations of the tangents at B and C.\n\nLet's start with tangent at C. Since C is at (0,0), and the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC. The slope of OC is (5\u221a14/56 - 0)/(5 - 0) = (5\u221a14/56)/5 = \u221a14/56.\n\nSo, the slope of OC is \u221a14/56. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is the negative reciprocal: -56/\u221a14.\n\nSimplify -56/\u221a14: 56 = 14 *4, so 56/\u221a14 = (14*4)/\u221a14 = 4\u221a14.\n\nSo, the slope is -4\u221a14.\n\nSo, the tangent at C passes through C (0,0) and has slope -4\u221a14. So, its equation is y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSimilarly, find the tangent at B.\n\nPoint B is at (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). The tangent at B is perpendicular to OB.\n\nSlope of OB: (5\u221a14/56 - 6\u221a14/5)/(5 - 39/5).\n\nWait, let's compute the slope.\n\nFirst, coordinates of O: (5, 5\u221a14/56).\n\nCoordinates of B: (39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nSo, slope of OB is (yB - yO)/(xB - xO).\n\nCompute yB - yO: (6\u221a14/5) - (5\u221a14/56) = (6\u221a14 *56 -5\u221a14*5)/(5*56) = (336\u221a14 -25\u221a14)/280 = (311\u221a14)/280.\n\nSimilarly, xB - xO: 39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5 = 14/5.\n\nSo, slope of OB is (311\u221a14/280)/(14/5) = (311\u221a14/280) * (5/14) = (311\u221a14 *5)/(280 *14) = (1555\u221a14)/(3920).\n\nSimplify: 1555 and 3920, let's see if they have a common factor. 1555 \u00f75=311, 3920 \u00f75=784. So, 311\u221a14/784.\n\nSo, slope of OB is 311\u221a14/784.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal: -784/(311\u221a14).\n\nSimplify this: let's rationalize the denominator.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14: -784\u221a14/(311*14) = -784\u221a14/(4354).\n\nSimplify 784 and 4354: Let's see, 784 \u00f714=56, 4354 \u00f714=311. So, 784=14*56, 4354=14*311.\n\nSo, -784\u221a14/(14*311) = -56\u221a14/311.\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent at B is -56\u221a14/311.\n\nNow, we can write the equation of the tangent at B.\n\nUsing point B (39/5, 6\u221a14/5) and slope m = -56\u221a14/311.\n\nEquation: y - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5).\n\nNow, we have two tangent equations: tangent at C is y = -4\u221a14 x, and tangent at B is y - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5).\n\nThe intersection point D of these two tangents can be found by solving these two equations.\n\nSo, let's set up the system:\n\n1. y = -4\u221a14 x\n\n2. y - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5)\n\nSubstitute equation 1 into equation 2:\n\n-4\u221a14 x - 6\u221a14/5 = (-56\u221a14/311)(x - 39/5)\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14 from all terms:\n\n\u221a14 [ -4x - 6/5 ] = \u221a14 [ (-56/311)(x - 39/5) ]\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a14:\n\n-4x - 6/5 = (-56/311)(x - 39/5)\n\nNow, let's write this as:\n\n-4x - 6/5 = (-56/311)x + (56/311)*(39/5)\n\nCompute the right-hand side:\n\nFirst, (56/311)*(39/5) = (56*39)/(311*5) = (2184)/(1555).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n-4x - 6/5 = (-56/311)x + 2184/1555\n\nLet me collect like terms. Move all terms to the left:\n\n-4x + (56/311)x -6/5 -2184/1555 = 0\n\nCompute the coefficients:\n\nFor x terms:\n\n-4x + (56/311)x = (-4*(311/311) + 56/311)x = [ (-1244 + 56)/311 ]x = (-1188/311)x.\n\nConstant terms:\n\n-6/5 - 2184/1555.\n\nConvert to common denominator 1555:\n\n-6/5 = (-6 * 311)/1555 = (-1866)/1555.\n\nSo, -1866/1555 -2184/1555 = (-1866 -2184)/1555 = (-4050)/1555.\n\nSimplify: -4050/1555. Both divide by 5: -810/311.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(-1188/311)x - 810/311 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 311:\n\n-1188x -810 = 0\n\nSo, -1188x = 810 => x = 810 / (-1188) = -810/1188.\n\nSimplify the fraction: 810 and 1188 are both divisible by 9.\n\n810 \u00f79=90, 1188 \u00f79=132.\n\n90 and 132 are both divisible by 6.\n\n90 \u00f76=15, 132 \u00f76=22.\n\nSo, x = -15/22.\n\nSo, x = -15/22.\n\nNow, find y using equation 1: y = -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22) = (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo, point D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nOkay, now I have coordinates for D. Now, I need to find the equation of line AD, which connects A(10,0) and D(-15/22, 30\u221a14/11).\n\nCompute the slope of AD.\n\nSlope m_AD = (yD - yA)/(xD - xA) = (30\u221a14/11 - 0)/( -15/22 -10 ) = (30\u221a14/11)/( -15/22 - 220/22 ) = (30\u221a14/11)/(-235/22) = (30\u221a14/11) * (-22/235) = (30\u221a14 * -22)/(11 *235).\n\nSimplify:\n\n30 and 235: 30 and 235 share a factor of 5: 30=5*6, 235=5*47.\n\nSimilarly, 22 and 11: 22=2*11.\n\nSo,\n\n(30\u221a14 * -22)/(11*235) = ( (5*6)\u221a14 * (-2*11) ) / (11*5*47) ) = (5*6*(-2)*11\u221a14)/(5*11*47) ).\n\nCancel out 5, 11:\n\n= (6*(-2)\u221a14)/47 = (-12\u221a14)/47.\n\nSo, the slope of AD is -12\u221a14/47.\n\nNow, the equation of AD: using point A(10,0):\n\ny - 0 = (-12\u221a14/47)(x -10).\n\nSo, y = (-12\u221a14/47)x + 120\u221a14/47.\n\nNow, this line AD intersects the circumcircle \u03c9 again at point P. We need to find the coordinates of P.\n\nSince point A is already on the circle and on line AD, P is the other intersection point. So, to find P, we can solve the equation of line AD with the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nThe equation of the circumcircle \u03c9: since it passes through A(10,0), B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5), and C(0,0), and its center is at O(5,5\u221a14/56), the equation is:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (y - 5\u221a14/56)^2 = R^2.\n\nWe have R = 75\u221a14/56, so R^2 = (75^2 *14)/(56^2).\n\nCompute R^2:\n\n75^2 = 5625, 56^2 = 3136.\n\nSo, R^2 = (5625 *14)/3136.\n\nCompute 5625 *14: 5625*10=56250, 5625*4=22500; total 56250+22500=78750.\n\nSo, R^2 = 78750 / 3136.\n\nSimplify: Let's see, 78750 \u00f7 14 = 5625, 3136 \u00f714=224.\n\nSo, 5625/224. So, R\u00b2 = 5625/224.\n\nSo, the equation of the circle is:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (y - 5\u221a14/56)^2 = 5625/224.\n\nNow, substitute y from the equation of AD into the circle equation.\n\nFrom AD: y = (-12\u221a14/47)x + 120\u221a14/47.\n\nPlug into the circle equation:\n\n(x -5)^2 + [ (-12\u221a14/47 x + 120\u221a14/47 ) - 5\u221a14/56 ]^2 = 5625/224.\n\nThis looks complicated, but let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, expand (x -5)^2: x\u00b2 -10x +25.\n\nNow, the second term: [ (-12\u221a14/47 x + 120\u221a14/47 ) - 5\u221a14/56 ].\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (-12/47 x + 120/47 ) -5/56 ].\n\nCompute the terms inside the brackets:\n\nCompute (-12/47 x + 120/47 -5/56).\n\nTo combine 120/47 and -5/56, find a common denominator. 47 and 56 are coprime, so LCD is 47*56=2632.\n\nConvert 120/47 = (120*56)/2632 = 6720/2632.\n\nConvert -5/56 = (-5*47)/2632 = -235/2632.\n\nSo, 120/47 -5/56 = 6720/2632 -235/2632 = (6720 -235)/2632 = 6485/2632.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\u221a14 [ (-12/47 x) + 6485/2632 ].\n\nFactor out 1/2632:\n\n= \u221a14 [ (-12*56 x +6485)/2632 ].\n\nWait, because 47*56=2632. So, to combine the terms, multiply numerator and denominator:\n\n-12/47 x = (-12*56 x)/2632 = (-672x)/2632.\n\nSo, -672x/2632 +6485/2632 = ( -672x +6485 ) /2632.\n\nSo, the second term is \u221a14*( -672x +6485 ) /2632.\n\nSo, the second term squared is [ \u221a14*( -672x +6485 ) /2632 ]^2 = 14*( -672x +6485 )\u00b2 / (2632)^2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the circle equation becomes:\n\n(x\u00b2 -10x +25) + [14*( -672x +6485 )\u00b2 ]/(2632)^2 = 5625/224.\n\nThis looks very messy, but perhaps I can substitute t = x, and solve for x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the line AD and find its other intersection with the circle.\n\nWait, another approach: since A is on both the line AD and the circle, when I plug the parametric equation of AD into the circle equation, I should get a quadratic equation in parameter t, with one root at A and the other at P.\n\nSo, let me parametrize line AD. Let me let t be a parameter such that when t=0, we are at A(10,0), and when t=1, we are at D(-15/22, 30\u221a14/11). Wait, but actually, since I need to find P beyond D, maybe t should go beyond D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a parameter s where point A corresponds to s=0 and point D corresponds to s=1, but then P is at some s>1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to parametrize in terms of distance from A. Let me let the parametric equations be:\n\nx = 10 + t*( (-15/22) -10 ) = 10 + t*(-235/22 )\n\ny = 0 + t*(30\u221a14/11 -0 ) = t*(30\u221a14/11 )\n\nSo, x = 10 - (235/22) t\n\ny = (30\u221a14/11 ) t\n\nNow, plug these into the circle equation:\n\n(x -5)^2 + (y - 5\u221a14/56)^2 = 5625/224.\n\nSubstitute x and y:\n\n(10 - (235/22)t -5)^2 + ( (30\u221a14/11 ) t -5\u221a14/56 )^2 = 5625/224.\n\nSimplify each term.\n\nFirst term: (5 - (235/22)t)^2.\n\nSecond term: (30\u221a14/11 t -5\u221a14/56 )^2.\n\nFactor out \u221a14 in the second term:\n\n\u221a14 (30/11 t -5/56 )^2.\n\nSo, second term becomes 14*(30/11 t -5/56 )^2.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n[5 - (235/22)t]^2 + 14*(30/11 t -5/56 )^2 = 5625/224.\n\nNow, let's expand each squared term.\n\nFirst term: [5 - (235/22)t]^2 = 25 - 2*5*(235/22)t + (235/22)^2 t\u00b2.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n25\n\n-2*5*(235/22) = -2*5*235/22 = -2350/22 = -1175/11.\n\n(235/22)^2 = (235)^2 / (22)^2. 235^2 = 55225, 22\u00b2=484. So, 55225/484.\n\nSo, first term expansion: 25 - (1175/11)t + (55225/484)t\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: 14*(30/11 t -5/56 )^2.\n\nCompute inside the square: 30/11 t -5/56.\n\nLet me compute (30/11 t -5/56 )^2 = (30/11 t)^2 - 2*(30/11 t)*(5/56) + (5/56)^2.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n(30/11 t)^2 = 900/121 t\u00b2.\n\n-2*(30/11)*(5/56) t = -2*(150)/(616) t = -300/616 t = -75/154 t.\n\n(5/56)^2 =25/3136.\n\nSo, inside squared term: 900/121 t\u00b2 -75/154 t +25/3136.\n\nMultiply by 14: 14*(900/121 t\u00b2 -75/154 t +25/3136 ) = (14*900)/121 t\u00b2 - (14*75)/154 t + (14*25)/3136.\n\nCompute each:\n\n14*900=12600, so 12600/121 t\u00b2.\n\n14*75=1050, 1050/154 = 1050 \u00f714=75, 154 \u00f714=11. So, 75/11 t.\n\n14*25=350, 350/3136=350 \u00f7 49=7.142... Wait, 350/3136=350 \u00f7 3136= divide numerator and denominator by 14: 25/224.\n\nSo, second term expansion: 12600/121 t\u00b2 - 75/11 t +25/224.\n\nNow, combine both expanded terms into the equation:\n\nFirst term: 25 - (1175/11)t + (55225/484)t\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: 12600/121 t\u00b2 -75/11 t +25/224.\n\nSum:\n\n25 +25/224 - (1175/11 +75/11 )t + (55225/484 +12600/121 )t\u00b2 = 5625/224.\n\nCompute each part:\n\nConstants: 25 +25/224.\n\nConvert 25 to 224 denominator: 25 = 25*224/224 =5600/224.\n\nSo, 5600/224 +25/224 =5625/224.\n\nLinear terms: -(1175/11 +75/11 )t = -(1250/11 )t.\n\nQuadratic terms: (55225/484 +12600/121 )t\u00b2.\n\nConvert 12600/121 to 484 denominator: 121*4=484, so 12600*4=50400. So, 50400/484.\n\nSo, 55225/484 +50400/484 = (55225 +50400)/484 =105625/484.\n\nSo, quadratic term: 105625/484 t\u00b2.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n5625/224 - (1250/11 )t + (105625/484 )t\u00b2 = 5625/224.\n\nSubtract 5625/224 from both sides:\n\n- (1250/11 )t + (105625/484 )t\u00b2 =0.\n\nFactor out t:\n\nt*( -1250/11 + (105625/484 )t ) =0.\n\nSo, solutions are t=0 and t= (1250/11 ) / (105625/484 ).\n\nSimplify t:\n\nt= (1250/11 ) * (484/105625 )= (1250 *484 )/(11 *105625 ).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n1250=125*10, 484=4*121, 11 is prime, 105625=100*1056.25? Wait, 105625 \u00f725=4225, which is 65\u00b2. 105625=25*4225=25*65\u00b2.\n\nWait, but 105625= 325\u00b2? Let me check 325\u00b2=105625? 300\u00b2=90000, 325\u00b2= (300+25)^2=90000 + 15000 +625=105625. Yes, so 105625=325\u00b2.\n\nSo, 484=22\u00b2, 1250=2*5^4, 11 is prime, 325=5^2*13.\n\nSo, t= (1250 *484 )/(11 *105625 )= (2*5^4 *22\u00b2 )/(11*5\u00b2*13\u00b2).\n\nSimplify:\n\n2 remains.\n\n5^4 /5\u00b2=5\u00b2=25.\n\n22\u00b2= (2*11)^2=4*121.\n\nDenominator:11*5\u00b2*13\u00b2=11*25*169.\n\nSo,\n\nt= [2 *25 *4 *121 ] / [11 *25 *169 ].\n\nCancel 25 in numerator and denominator.\n\nt= [2 *4 *121 ] / [11 *169 ].\n\n121=11\u00b2, 169=13\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nt= (8 *11\u00b2 )/(11 *13\u00b2 )= (8 *11 )/(13\u00b2 )= 88/169.\n\nSo, t=88/169.\n\nSo, the parameter t=88/169 corresponds to point P.\n\nSo, coordinates of P:\n\nx=10 - (235/22 )*(88/169 )\n\nCompute 235/22 *88/169:\n\n235/22 *88=235*(88/22)=235*(4)=940.\n\nSo, 940/169.\n\nSo, x=10 -940/169.\n\nConvert 10 to 169 denominator: 10=1690/169.\n\nSo, x=1690/169 -940/169=750/169.\n\nSimilarly, y=(30\u221a14/11 )*(88/169 ).\n\nCompute 30/11 *88=30*8=240.\n\nSo, y=240\u221a14 /169.\n\nSo, point P is at (750/169, 240\u221a14/169 ).\n\nNow, we need to compute AP.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), point P is at (750/169, 240\u221a14/169 ).\n\nCompute the distance between A and P.\n\nAP = sqrt[ (750/169 -10)^2 + (240\u221a14/169 -0)^2 ].\n\nFirst, compute 750/169 -10: 750/169 -1690/169= (750-1690)/169= (-940)/169.\n\nSo, the x-component is (-940/169).\n\nThe y-component is 240\u221a14/169.\n\nSo,\n\nAP\u00b2 = ( (-940/169)^2 ) + ( (240\u221a14/169)^2 )\n\n= (940\u00b2)/(169\u00b2) + (240\u00b2 *14)/(169\u00b2 )\n\nFactor out 1/(169\u00b2):\n\n= [940\u00b2 +240\u00b2 *14 ] /169\u00b2.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n940\u00b2: 940*940. Let's compute 94\u00b2=8836, so 940\u00b2=883600.\n\n240\u00b2=57600, so 57600*14=806400.\n\nSo, numerator=883600 +806400=1,690,000.\n\nSo, AP\u00b2=1,690,000 / (169\u00b2).\n\nCompute denominator:169\u00b2=28561.\n\nSo, AP\u00b2=1,690,000 /28561.\n\nSimplify:\n\n1,690,000 \u00f7169=10,000. Because 169*10,000=1,690,000.\n\nSo, AP\u00b2=10,000 /169.\n\nThus, AP= sqrt(10,000/169 )=100/13.\n\nSo, AP=100/13. So, m=100, n=13. They are coprime. So, m +n=113.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{113}\n\n\nGiven triangle \\(ABC\\) with sides \\(AB = 5\\), \\(BC = 9\\), and \\(AC = 10\\), we need to find the length of \\(AP\\) where \\(P\\) is the intersection of line \\(AD\\) with the circumcircle of \\(ABC\\). The tangents to the circumcircle at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) intersect at point \\(D\\).\n\nFirst, we compute the area \\(\\Delta\\) of triangle \\(ABC\\) using Heron's formula:\n- Semi-perimeter \\(s = \\frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12\\)\n- Area \\(\\Delta = \\sqrt{12 \\times (12 - 9) \\times (12 - 10) \\times (12 - 5)} = \\sqrt{504} = 6\\sqrt{14}\\)\n\nNext, we find the circumradius \\(R\\) of triangle \\(ABC\\):\n- \\(R = \\frac{abc}{4\\Delta} = \\frac{5 \\times 9 \\times 10}{4 \\times 6\\sqrt{14}} = \\frac{450}{24\\sqrt{14}} = \\frac{75\\sqrt{14}}{56}\\)\n\nWe place the triangle in a coordinate system with \\(C\\) at the origin \\((0,0)\\), \\(A\\) at \\((10,0)\\), and find the coordinates of \\(B\\) as \\((\\frac{39}{5}, \\frac{6\\sqrt{14}}{5})\\).\n\nThe center \\(O\\) of the circumcircle is found by solving the perpendicular bisectors of \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\), resulting in \\(O\\) at \\((5, \\frac{5\\sqrt{14}}{56})\\).\n\nThe equations of the tangents at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are derived, and their intersection point \\(D\\) is found to be \\((- \\frac{15}{22}, \\frac{30\\sqrt{14}}{11})\\).\n\nThe equation of line \\(AD\\) is determined with slope \\(-\\frac{12\\sqrt{14}}{47}\\) and passing through \\(A(10,0)\\), resulting in the equation \\(y = -\\frac{12\\sqrt{14}}{47}x + \\frac{120\\sqrt{14}}{47}\\).\n\nUsing parametric equations, we find the intersection of line \\(AD\\) with the circumcircle, leading to the parameter \\(t = \\frac{88}{169}\\). Substituting \\(t\\) back, we find the coordinates of \\(P\\) as \\((\\frac{750}{169}, \\frac{240\\sqrt{14}}{169})\\).\n\nFinally, we compute the distance \\(AP\\) using the distance formula:\n- \\(AP = \\sqrt{\\left(10 - \\frac{750}{169}\\right)^2 + \\left(0 - \\frac{240\\sqrt{14}}{169}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{100}{13}\\right)^2} = \\frac{100}{13}\\)\n\nThus, \\(AP = \\frac{100}{13}\\), and the sum of the numerator and denominator is \\(100 + 13 = 113\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{113}\n\\]",
