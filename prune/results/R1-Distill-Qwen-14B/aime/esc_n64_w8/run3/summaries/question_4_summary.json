      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, so this sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember something about winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, the key is to figure out for which values of n Bob can be in a losing position, but since he's the second player, it's when Alice is forced into a losing position on her first move.\n\nWait, actually, if Alice is the first player, then for Bob to have a winning strategy, the initial position n must be a losing position for Alice. Because then, whatever Alice does, Bob can respond in a way that leads Alice back into a losing position, and so on, until Bob wins.\n\nSo, I need to find all n \u22642024 where n is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.\n\nTo approach this, I should model the game and find the pattern of winning and losing positions.\n\nLet's start by analyzing small values of n and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nn=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Bob can't win. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice, so it's a losing position for Bob.\n\nn=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob can then take that 1 and win. Wait, but if Alice takes 1, n becomes 1, Bob takes it and wins. So Alice would not do that. Alternatively, Alice can take 4 tokens, but n=2, she can't take 4. So Alice's only move is to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who can then take it and win. So for n=2, Alice can't force a win. Wait, so n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for the first player, so Bob can win.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when n=2, it's Alice's turn. She can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes that 1 and wins. So Alice would lose. Alternatively, can Alice take 4? No, because n=2 <4. So Alice is forced to take 1, leading to Bob's win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for the first player.\n\nSimilarly, n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving 2 for Bob. Then Bob is in a losing position (as per n=2). So Bob would lose, meaning Alice can force a win. So n=3 is a winning position for Alice.\n\nWait, no. Wait, n=3: Alice takes 1, leaving 2. Then Bob is faced with n=2, which is a losing position for the player whose turn it is. So Bob can't force a win from n=2, meaning Alice can win from n=3.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen n=2, it's a losing position for the player whose turn it is. So if Alice leaves n=2 for Bob, then Bob is in a losing position, so Alice can win. So for n=3, if Alice takes 1, leaving n=2 for Bob, who is now in a losing position, so Alice can win. So n=3 is a winning position.\n\nn=4: Alice can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So n=4 is a winning position.\n\nn=5: Alice can take 1, leaving n=4 for Bob. Since n=4 is a winning position for Bob, he can take 4 and win. Alternatively, Alice can take 4, leaving n=1 for Bob, who can take 1 and win. So in both cases, Bob can win. So n=5 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win.\n\nWait, let's double-check. For n=5, Alice's options are to take 1 or 4.\n\n- If she takes 1, n becomes 4. Bob can then take 4 and win.\n- If she takes 4, n becomes 1. Bob takes 1 and wins.\nSo in either case, Bob wins. So n=5 is a losing position for Alice.\n\nn=6: Alice can take 1, leaving n=5, which is a losing position for Bob. So Bob can't win, meaning Alice can force a win. So n=6 is a winning position.\n\nWait, because if Alice takes 1, leaving n=5 (a losing position for Bob), then Bob can't force a win. So n=6 is a winning position for Alice.\n\nn=7: Alice's options: take 1 \u2192 n=6, which is a winning position for Bob? Or take 4 \u2192 n=3, which is a winning position for Bob?\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, for n=6, is that a losing or winning position for the player whose turn it is.\n\nWait, let me make a table to keep track.\n\nLet me make a list from n=0 upwards, determining whether each is a winning (W) or losing (L) position.\n\nn | outcome (W or L)\n0 | L (no moves, so previous player wins)\n1 | W (can take 1)\n2 | ?\n3 | ?\n4 | W (can take 4)\n5 | L\n6 | ?\n7 | ?\n\nWait, let me start from n=0 and go step by step.\n\nn=0: losing position (no moves can be made, so the player who just moved wins). So if it's your turn and n=0, you lose.\n\nn=1: you can take 1, so it's a winning position (W).\n\nn=2: you can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is a W for them. Wait, but if you take 1, opponent gets n=1, which is W, meaning opponent can win. So for n=2, taking 1 leads to opponent's W. So n=2 is a losing position (L) because any move you make allows the opponent to win.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no: if n=2, you can take 1, leaving n=1 for opponent, which is W for them. So opponent can take 1 and win. So for n=2, taking 1 leads to opponent's win. But you can't take 4 because n=2 <4. So n=2 is a losing position because no matter what you do, the opponent can win.\n\nn=3: you can take 1, leaving n=2, which is L for opponent. Because if you take 1, opponent is left with n=2, which is a losing position for them. So n=3 is a winning position (W).\n\nn=4: you can take 4 and win, so W.\n\nn=5: you can take 1, leaving n=4, which is W for opponent. Or take 4, leaving n=1, which is W for opponent. So no matter what you do, opponent can win. So n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: you can take 1, leaving n=5, which is L for opponent. So n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: you can take 1, leaving n=6 (W for opponent), or take 4, leaving n=3 (W for opponent). So both options leave opponent in W positions, so n=7 is L.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nWait, when you're at n=7, taking 1 leaves n=6, which is W for opponent. So opponent can take 1, leaving n=5, which is L for you. Alternatively, opponent could take 4 from n=6, but n=6 is 6, so 6-4=2, which is L. Hmm, but opponent would prefer to take the move that leaves you in L.\n\nWait, but for n=6, the current player can take 1, leaving n=5 (L for the next player). So n=6 is W.\n\nSo for n=7, taking 1 leaves n=6, which is W for opponent. So opponent can take 1, leaving n=5 (L for you). So you would lose. Alternatively, if you take 4 from n=7, leaving n=3 (W for opponent). Opponent can take 1, leaving n=2 (L for you). So either way, opponent can force you into L.\n\nSo n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: you can take 1, leaving n=7 (L for opponent), so opponent is in L. So n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: you can take 1, leaving n=8 (W for opponent), or take 4, leaving n=5 (L for opponent). So if you take 4, leaving n=5, which is L for opponent, then opponent can't win. So n=9 is W.\n\nWait, because if you take 4 from n=9, leaving n=5, which is L for opponent. So opponent can't win, so n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: you can take 1, leaving n=9 (W for opponent), or take 4, leaving n=6 (W for opponent). So no matter what you do, opponent is left with a W position. So n=10 is L.\n\nWait, let me make sure.\n\nn=10: taking 1 \u2192 n=9 (W). Opponent can then take 4, leaving n=5 (L for you). Or take 1, leaving n=8 (W for you). Wait, no, opponent's goal is to leave you in L.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let me think in terms of the current player's options.\n\nAt n=10:\n\nOption 1: take 1 \u2192 n=9. Now, the opponent is at n=9, which is W. So opponent can make a move to leave me in L.\n\nFrom n=9, the opponent can take 4, leaving n=5 (L for me). So yes, opponent can win.\n\nOption 2: take 4 \u2192 n=6. Opponent is at n=6, which is W. Opponent can take 1, leaving n=5 (L for me). So again, opponent can win.\n\nSo for n=10, both options leave opponent in a position where they can force me into L. So n=10 is L.\n\nn=11: take 1 \u2192 n=10 (L for opponent). So opponent is in L. So n=11 is W.\n\nn=12: take 1 \u2192 n=11 (W for opponent). Or take 4 \u2192 n=8 (W for opponent). So both options leave opponent in W positions. So n=12 is L.\n\nWait, no. Wait, n=12: if I take 1, opponent is at n=11 (W). Opponent can take 1, leaving n=10 (L for me). So I would lose. Alternatively, if I take 4, opponent is at n=8 (W). Opponent can take 1, leaving n=7 (L for me). So either way, opponent can force me into L. So n=12 is L.\n\nWait, but n=12 is the first time we have L after a series. Let me see the pattern so far.\n\nn | outcome\n0 | L\n1 | W\n2 | L\n3 | W\n4 | W\n5 | L\n6 | W\n7 | L\n8 | W\n9 | W\n10 | L\n11 | W\n12 | L\n\nHmm, looking at this, I can see a pattern emerging every 5 numbers, perhaps? Let me check.\n\nWait, from n=0 to n=5:\n\nn: 0 1 2 3 4 5\n\noutcomes: L W L W W L\n\nn=6: W, n=7: L, n=8: W, n=9: W, n=10: L, n=11: W, n=12: L.\n\nHmm, so the pattern seems to be L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L...\n\nSo every 5 numbers, the pattern repeats? Let me check.\n\nLooking at n=0 to 5: L, W, L, W, W, L.\n\nn=6 to 11: W, L, W, W, L, W.\n\nn=12 to 17: L, W, L, W, W, L.\n\nYes, that seems to be the case. So the cycle is L, W, L, W, W, and then repeats every 5.\n\nSo the losing positions (L) are at n=0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, etc.\n\nSo the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 and 0 mod 5?\n\nWait, n=0: 0 mod 5 is 0.\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2.\n\nn=5: 5 mod5=0.\n\nn=7:7 mod5=2.\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0.\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2.\n\nn=15:15 mod5=0.\n\nn=17:17 mod5=2.\n\nYes, so the losing positions are n where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nSo, if n \u22610 or 2 mod5, then it's a losing position for the current player.\n\nSo, in the context of this problem, Bob can win if and only if the starting position n is a losing position for Alice, which is when n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, now, the question is to find the number of positive integers n \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, how many numbers \u22642024 are congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nFirst, count the numbers \u22610 mod5: these are multiples of 5.\n\nThe smallest is 5, largest \u22642024 is 2020 (since 2020=5*404). So the count is 404 (since 5*1=5 up to 5*404=2020).\n\nWait, but wait, n must be positive integers \u22642024, so 5*1=5 up to 5*404=2020. So that's 404 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5: these are 2,7,12,... up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nThe largest number \u22642024 and \u22612 mod5 is 2022, because 2022=5*404 + 2.\n\nWait, 5*404=2020, so 2020+2=2022.\n\nSo the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with a=2, d=5.\n\nThe number of terms is given by ((last term - first term)/d ) +1.\n\nSo (2022 -2)/5 +1 = (2020/5) +1 =404 +1=405.\n\nSo there are 405 numbers \u22612 mod5 \u22642024.\n\nSo total numbers where Bob can win are 404 (for \u22610) +405 (for \u22612) = 809.\n\nWait, but wait, let's make sure that 2024 is included correctly.\n\nWait, 2024 mod5: 2024 divided by5 is 404*5=2020, 2024-2020=4. So 2024 mod5=4. So 2024 is not \u22610 or 2 mod5. So the last term for \u22612 mod5 is 2022, as I had.\n\nSimilarly, for \u22610 mod5, the last term is 2020.\n\nSo, 404 numbers for \u22610, and 405 for \u22612. Total 404+405=809.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the count for \u22610 mod5. The numbers are 5,10,...,2020.\n\nNumber of terms: (2020)/5 =404. So 404 numbers.\n\nFor \u22612 mod5: numbers are 2,7,...,2022.\n\nNumber of terms: (2022-2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo total is 404+405=809.\n\nSo the answer is 809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if the initial analysis is correct. Because in the game, the losing positions are when n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWait, looking back at the earlier table:\n\nn=0: L\n\nn=1: W\n\nn=2: L\n\nn=3: W\n\nn=4: W\n\nn=5: L\n\nn=6: W\n\nn=7: L\n\nn=8: W\n\nn=9: W\n\nn=10: L\n\nn=11: W\n\nn=12: L\n\nSo, yes, the losing positions are n=0,2,5,7,10,12, etc., which are 0 and 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the logic seems correct. So the number of n \u22642024 where Bob can win is 809.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game's winning and losing positions. \n\nA losing position is one where the current player cannot force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves. Through analysis, we identify that the losing positions occur at \\( n \\equiv 0 \\) or \\( 2 \\pmod{5} \\). \n\n- **Numbers \\( \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\):** These are multiples of 5. The largest such number \u22642024 is 2020, giving 404 terms.\n- **Numbers \\( \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\):** These start at 2 and go up to 2022.

Let me check.\n\nWait, when you're at n=7, taking 1 leaves n=6, which is W for opponent. So opponent can take 1, leaving n=5, which is L for you. Alternatively, opponent could take 4 from n=6, but n=6 is 6, so 6-4=2, which is L. Hmm, but opponent would prefer to take the move that leaves you in L.\n\nWait, but for n=6, the current player can take 1, leaving n=5 (L for the next player). So n=6 is W.\n\nSo for n=7, taking 1 leaves n=6, which is W for opponent. So opponent can take 1, leaving n=5 (L for you). So you would lose. Alternatively, if you take 4 from n=7, leaving n=3 (W for opponent). Opponent can take 1, leaving n=2 (L for you). So either way, opponent can force you into L.\n\nSo n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: you can take 1, leaving n=7 (L for opponent), so opponent is in L. So n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: you can take 1, leaving n=8 (W for opponent), or take 4, leaving n=5 (L for opponent). So if you take 4, leaving n=5, which is L for opponent, then opponent can't win. So n=9 is W.\n\nWait, because if you take 4 from n=9, leaving n=5, which is L for opponent. So opponent can't win, so n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: you can take 1, leaving n=9 (W for opponent), or take 4, leaving n=6 (W for opponent). So no matter what you do, opponent is left with a W position. So n=10 is L.\n\nWait, let me make sure.\n\nn=10: taking 1 \u2192 n=9 (W). Opponent can then take 4, leaving n=5 (L for you). Or take 1, leaving n=8 (W for you). Wait, no, opponent's goal is to leave you in L.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let me think in terms of the current player's options.\n\nAt n=10:\n\nOption 1: take 1 \u2192 n=9. Now, the opponent is at n=9, which is W. So opponent can make a move to leave me in L.\n\nFrom n=9, the opponent can take 4, leaving n=5 (L for me). So yes, opponent can win.\n\nOption 2: take 4 \u2192 n=6. Opponent is at n=6, which is W. Opponent can take 1, leaving n=5 (L for me). So again, opponent can win.\n\nSo for n=10, both options leave opponent in a position where they can force me into L. So n=10 is L.\n\nn=11: take 1 \u2192 n=10 (L for opponent). So opponent is in L. So n=11 is W.\n\nn=12: take 1 \u2192 n=11 (W for opponent). Or take 4 \u2192 n=8 (W for opponent). So both options leave opponent in W positions. So n=12 is L.\n\nWait, no. Wait, n=12: if I take 1, opponent is at n=11 (W). Opponent can take 1, leaving n=10 (L for me). So I would lose. Alternatively, if I take 4, opponent is at n=8 (W). Opponent can take 1, leaving n=7 (L for me). So either way, opponent can force me into L. So n=12 is L.\n\nWait, but n=12 is the first time we have L after a series. Let me see the pattern so far.\n\nn | outcome\n0 | L\n1 | W\n2 | L\n3 | W\n4 | W\n5 | L\n6 | W\n7 | L\n8 | W\n9 | W\n10 | L\n11 | W\n12 | L\n\nHmm, looking at this, I can see a pattern emerging every 5 numbers, perhaps? Let me check.\n\nWait, from n=0 to n=5:\n\nn: 0 1 2 3 4 5\n\noutcomes: L W L W W L\n\nn=6: W, n=7: L, n=8: W, n=9: W, n=10: L, n=11: W, n=12: L.\n\nHmm, so the pattern seems to be L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L...\n\nSo every 5 numbers, the pattern repeats? Let me check.\n\nLooking at n=0 to 5: L, W, L, W, W, L.\n\nn=6 to 11: W, L, W, W, L, W.\n\nn=12 to 17: L, W, L, W, W, L.\n\nYes, that seems to be the case. So the cycle is L, W, L, W, W, and then repeats every 5.\n\nSo the losing positions (L) are at n=0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, etc.\n\nSo the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 and 0 mod 5?\n\nWait, n=0: 0 mod 5 is 0.\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2.\n\nn=5: 5 mod5=0.\n\nn=7:7 mod5=2.\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0.\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2.\n\nn=15:15 mod5=0.\n\nn=17:17 mod5=2.\n\nYes, so the losing positions are n where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nSo, if n \u22610 or 2 mod5, then it's a losing position for the current player.\n\nSo, in the context of this problem, Bob can win if and only if the starting position n is a losing position for Alice, which is when n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, now, the question is to find the number of positive integers n \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, how many numbers \u22642024 are congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nFirst, count the numbers \u22610 mod5: these are multiples of 5.\n\nThe smallest is 5, largest \u22642024 is 2020 (since 2020=5*404). So the count is 404 (since 5*1=5 up to 5*404=2020).\n\nWait, but wait, n must be positive integers \u22642024, so 5*1=5 up to 5*404=2020. So that's 404 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5: these are 2,7,12,... up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nThe largest number \u22642024 and \u22612 mod5 is 2022, because 2022=5*404 + 2.\n\nWait, 5*404=2020, so 2020+2=2022.\n\nSo the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with a=2, d=5.\n\nThe number of terms is given by ((last term - first term)/d ) +1.\n\nSo (2022 -2)/5 +1 = (2020/5) +1 =404 +1=405.\n\nSo there are 405 numbers \u22612 mod5 \u22642024.\n\nSo total numbers where Bob can win are 404 (for \u22610) +405 (for \u22612) = 809.\n\nWait, but wait, let's make sure that 2024 is included correctly.\n\nWait, 2024 mod5: 2024 divided by5 is 404*5=2020, 2024-2020=4. So 2024 mod5=4. So 2024 is not \u22610 or 2 mod5. So the last term for \u22612 mod5 is 2022, as I had.\n\nSimilarly, for \u22610 mod5, the last term is 2020.\n\nSo, 404 numbers for \u22610, and 405 for \u22612. Total 404+405=809.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the count for \u22610 mod5. The numbers are 5,10,...,2020.\n\nNumber of terms: (2020)/5 =404. So 404 numbers.\n\nFor \u22612 mod5: numbers are 2,7,...,2022.\n\nNumber of terms: (2022-2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo total is 404+405=809.\n\nSo the answer is 809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if the initial analysis is correct. Because in the game, the losing positions are when n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWait, looking back at the earlier table:\n\nn=0: L\n\nn=1: W\n\nn=2: L\n\nn=3: W\n\nn=4: W\n\nn=5: L\n\nn=6: W\n\nn=7: L\n\nn=8: W\n\nn=9: W\n\nn=10: L\n\nn=11: W\n\nn=12: L\n\nSo, yes, the losing positions are n=0,2,5,7,10,12, etc., which are 0 and 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the logic seems correct. So the number of n \u22642024 where Bob can win is 809.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game's winning and losing positions. \n\nA losing position is one where the current player cannot force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves. Through analysis, we identify that the losing positions occur at \\( n \\equiv 0 \\) or \\( 2 \\pmod{5} \\). \n\n- **Numbers \\( \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\):** These are multiples of 5. The largest such number \u22642024 is 2020, giving 404 terms.\n- **Numbers \\( \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\):** These start at 2 and go up to 2022. This sequence has 405 terms.\n\nAdding these, the total number of losing positions is \\( 404 + 405 = 809 \\).\n\nThus, the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) where Bob can guarantee a win is:\n\n\\boxed{809}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each time. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, let's think about game theory here. It sounds like a variant of the classic Nim game, but with specific move options. The key is to determine for each n whether the starting player (Alice) can force a win or if the second player (Bob) can. So, we're looking for positions where the second player can win, regardless of the first player's moves.\n\nI remember that in such games, positions can be classified as either \"winning\" or \"losing.\" A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite\u2014the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.\n\nSo, for this problem, we need to find all n where Bob can win, which would mean n is a losing position for Alice when she starts.\n\nLet's try to model this. Let's denote f(n) as the status of the game when there are n tokens left. If f(n) is true, it means the current player can force a win; if it's false, the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.\n\nThe base cases would be:\n- f(0): Well, if there are zero tokens left, the game is over. Since the last token was taken by the previous player, the current player loses. So, f(0) = false.\n- f(1): The current player can take 1 token and win. So, f(1) = true.\n- f(2): Similarly, the current player takes 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Wait, no\u2014that's not right. Wait, if n=2, the current player can take 1, leaving 1, which is a winning position for the opponent. Or take 4, but you can't take 4 from 2. So the current player can only take 1, which leaves n=1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. So, f(2) would be false because the current player can't force a win. Wait, no, wait\u2014if you leave the opponent with n=1, which is a winning position for them, meaning they can win from there. So, if the current player takes 1 from n=2, the opponent can take the last one and win. So, the current player (for n=2) can't force a win, so f(2)=false.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of Grundy numbers or something. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me list f(n) for small values and see if a pattern emerges.\n\nn=0: f(0) = false (losing position)\nn=1: current player takes 1 and wins. So, f(1) = true.\nn=2: current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who can then win. So, if the current player takes 1, opponent wins. So f(2)=false.\nn=3: current player can take 1, leaving n=2 (which is a losing position for the opponent). So, if the current player takes 1, opponent is left with n=2, which is a losing position. Therefore, current player can force a win. So f(3)=true.\nn=4: current player can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So, f(4)=true.\nn=5: current player can take 1, leaving n=4 for the opponent, who can then win. Or take 4, leaving n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So, if current player takes 1, opponent can take 4 and win. If current player takes 4, opponent takes 1 and wins. So, in both cases, opponent can win. Therefore, f(5)=false.\nn=6: current player can take 1, leaving n=5 (which is a losing position for opponent). So, f(6)=true.\nn=7: current player can take 1, leaving n=6 (winning for opponent) or take 4, leaving n=3 (winning for opponent). So, if current player takes 1, opponent can win from n=6. If current player takes 4, opponent can win from n=3. So, f(7)=false.\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, for n=7, if the current player takes 1, leaving n=6. From n=6, the opponent can take 1, leaving n=5, which is a losing position for the current player. Wait, no\u2014if the opponent is faced with n=6, which is a winning position, they can take 1, leaving n=5, which is a losing position for the current player. So, if the current player takes 1 from n=7, the opponent can take 1, leaving n=5 (losing for current player). So, the current player (at n=7) would lose if they take 1. Alternatively, if the current player takes 4 from n=7, leaving n=3, which is a winning position for the opponent (since f(3)=true). So, opponent can then take 1, leaving n=2 (losing for current player). So, in both cases, the current player at n=7 can't force a win. Therefore, f(7)=false.\n\nWait, so let's list this out:\n\nn | f(n)\n0 | F\n1 | T\n2 | F\n3 | T\n4 | T\n5 | F\n6 | T\n7 | F\n\nHmm, I see a pattern here. Let's check n=8.\n\nn=8: current player can take 1, leaving n=7 (f= F), which is a losing position for the opponent. So, by taking 1, opponent is left with a losing position, so current player can win. So, f(8)=true.\n\nn=9: current player can take 1, leaving n=8 (f=T) or take 4, leaving n=5 (f=F). So, if the current player takes 4, opponent is left with n=5 (f=F), which is a losing position. So, current player can win by taking 4. So, f(9)=true.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier pattern. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, n=5 is f=F, so if current player takes 4 from n=9, leaving n=5, which is a losing position for the opponent. So, yes, f(9)=true.\n\nWait, so n=8 and n=9 are both true.\n\nn=10: current player can take 1, leaving n=9 (f=T), or take 4, leaving n=6 (f=T). So, both options leave the opponent in a winning position. So, f(10)=false.\n\nHmm, so the pattern is:\n\nn | f(n)\n0 | F\n1 | T\n2 | F\n3 | T\n4 | T\n5 | F\n6 | T\n7 | F\n8 | T\n9 | T\n10| F\n\nWait, maybe the losing positions are at n=0,2,5,7,10,... Let me see if I can find a pattern in the losing positions.\n\nLooking at the losing positions: 0,2,5,7,10.\n\nThe differences between them: 2 (0 to 2), 3 (2 to5), 2 (5 to7), 3 (7 to10). So alternates between adding 2 and 3.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\n0 +2=2\n\n2+3=5\n\n5+2=7\n\n7+3=10\n\n10+2=12\n\n12+3=15\n\n15+2=17\n\n17+3=20\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 mod 5? Wait, 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nWait, 0 mod 5 is 0.\n\n2 mod 5 is 2.\n\n5 mod 5 is 0.\n\n7 mod5 is 2.\n\n10 mod5 is 0.\n\n12 mod5 is 2.\n\n15 mod5 is 0.\n\n17 mod5 is 2.\n\n20 mod5 is 0.\n\nSo, the losing positions are numbers where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nn=0: 0 mod5=0 \u2192 losing.\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2 \u2192 losing.\n\nn=5: 5 mod5=0 \u2192 losing.\n\nn=7:7 mod5=2 \u2192 losing.\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0 \u2192 losing.\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2 \u2192 losing.\n\nn=15:15 mod5=0 \u2192 losing.\n\nYes, this seems to fit.\n\nSo, the losing positions are n where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, for these n, the current player cannot force a win, meaning that the second player can win if the first player is faced with such a position.\n\nSo, in our problem, Bob can win if n is a losing position for Alice, i.e., when n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of positive integers n \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nLet me compute how many numbers \u22642024 are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo5.\n\nFirst, let's find how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5.\n\nThe smallest is 5, the largest \u22642024 is 2020 (since 2020=5\u00d7404).\n\nNumber of terms: 404 (since 5\u00d71=5, 5\u00d7404=2020).\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5.\n\nThe smallest is 2, the largest \u22642024 is 2022 (since 2022=5\u00d7404 +2=2022).\n\nNumber of terms: Let's see. The sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nNumber of terms: Let me compute (2022 -2)/5 +1 = (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo, numbers \u22610 mod5: 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5: 405 numbers.\n\nTotal losing positions: 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but wait: 2024 divided by5 is 404.8. So the last term for \u22612 mod5 is 2022, which is 5\u00d7404 +2=2022.\n\nSo, from n=2 to n=2022, step 5: the count is ((2022 -2)/5) +1= (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.\n\nSimilarly, for \u22610 mod5: from 5 to 2020, step5: (2020-5)/5 +1= (2015/5)+1=403+1=404.\n\nSo total is 405+404=809.\n\nBut wait, 2024 itself: 2024 mod5 is 2024-5\u00d7404=2024-2020=4. So, 2024\u22614 mod5, which is not a losing position.\n\nSo, the total number of losing positions \u22642024 is 809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me compute the number of terms \u22610 mod5: floor(2024/5)=404 (since 5\u00d7404=2020 \u22642024). But wait, 5\u00d70=0 is included? But in the problem statement, n is a positive integer, so n starts from 1.\n\nSo, for \u22610 mod5, n=5,10,...,2020. The count is 404.\n\nFor \u22612 mod5: n=2,7,12,...,2022. The count is 405.\n\nSo, total 404+405=809.\n\nSo, the answer is 809.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When n=0, it's a losing position, but n starts at 1. So, for n=0, it's not counted. So, for \u22610 mod5, the numbers are 5,10,...,2020: 404 numbers.\n\nFor \u22612 mod5: 2,7,...,2022: 405 numbers.\n\nSo, total is 809.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n",

Let me see if I can find a pattern in the losing positions.\n\nLooking at the losing positions: 0,2,5,7,10.\n\nThe differences between them: 2 (0 to 2), 3 (2 to5), 2 (5 to7), 3 (7 to10). So alternates between adding 2 and 3.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\n0 +2=2\n\n2+3=5\n\n5+2=7\n\n7+3=10\n\n10+2=12\n\n12+3=15\n\n15+2=17\n\n17+3=20\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 mod 5? Wait, 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nWait, 0 mod 5 is 0.\n\n2 mod 5 is 2.\n\n5 mod 5 is 0.\n\n7 mod5 is 2.\n\n10 mod5 is 0.\n\n12 mod5 is 2.\n\n15 mod5 is 0.\n\n17 mod5 is 2.\n\n20 mod5 is 0.\n\nSo, the losing positions are numbers where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nn=0: 0 mod5=0 \u2192 losing.\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2 \u2192 losing.\n\nn=5: 5 mod5=0 \u2192 losing.\n\nn=7:7 mod5=2 \u2192 losing.\n\nn=10:10 mod5=0 \u2192 losing.\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2 \u2192 losing.\n\nn=15:15 mod5=0 \u2192 losing.\n\nYes, this seems to fit.\n\nSo, the losing positions are n where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, for these n, the current player cannot force a win, meaning that the second player can win if the first player is faced with such a position.\n\nSo, in our problem, Bob can win if n is a losing position for Alice, i.e., when n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of positive integers n \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nLet me compute how many numbers \u22642024 are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo5.\n\nFirst, let's find how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5.\n\nThe smallest is 5, the largest \u22642024 is 2020 (since 2020=5\u00d7404).\n\nNumber of terms: 404 (since 5\u00d71=5, 5\u00d7404=2020).\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5.\n\nThe smallest is 2, the largest \u22642024 is 2022 (since 2022=5\u00d7404 +2=2022).\n\nNumber of terms: Let's see. The sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nNumber of terms: Let me compute (2022 -2)/5 +1 = (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo, numbers \u22610 mod5: 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5: 405 numbers.\n\nTotal losing positions: 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but wait: 2024 divided by5 is 404.8. So the last term for \u22612 mod5 is 2022, which is 5\u00d7404 +2=2022.\n\nSo, from n=2 to n=2022, step 5: the count is ((2022 -2)/5) +1= (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.\n\nSimilarly, for \u22610 mod5: from 5 to 2020, step5: (2020-5)/5 +1= (2015/5)+1=403+1=404.\n\nSo total is 405+404=809.\n\nBut wait, 2024 itself: 2024 mod5 is 2024-5\u00d7404=2024-2020=4. So, 2024\u22614 mod5, which is not a losing position.\n\nSo, the total number of losing positions \u22642024 is 809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me compute the number of terms \u22610 mod5: floor(2024/5)=404 (since 5\u00d7404=2020 \u22642024). But wait, 5\u00d70=0 is included? But in the problem statement, n is a positive integer, so n starts from 1.\n\nSo, for \u22610 mod5, n=5,10,...,2020. The count is 404.\n\nFor \u22612 mod5: n=2,7,12,...,2022. The count is 405.\n\nSo, total 404+405=809.\n\nSo, the answer is 809.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When n=0, it's a losing position, but n starts at 1. So, for n=0, it's not counted. So, for \u22610 mod5, the numbers are 5,10,...,2020: 404 numbers.\n\nFor \u22612 mod5: 2,7,...,2022: 405 numbers.\n\nSo, total is 809.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n\nAlice and Bob play a game with a stack of $n$ tokens. Players take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens, with Alice going first. The player who removes the last token wins. We need to determine how many positive integers $n \\leq 2024$ allow Bob to guarantee a win, meaning $n$ is a losing position for Alice.\n\nTo solve this, we classify positions as winning (current player can force a win) or losing (current player cannot avoid losing). Through analysis, we find that losing positions occur when $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ or $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nWe count the numbers $\\leq 2024$ in these two categories:\n- For $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$: The sequence is $5, 10, \\ldots, 2020$, yielding $404$ numbers.\n- For $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$: The sequence is $2, 7, \\ldots, 2022$, yielding $405$ numbers.\n\nAdding these, we get $404 + 405 = 809$ losing positions.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{809}$",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays. Hmm, okay.\n\nLet me start by understanding the game mechanics. It's a turn-based game with perfect information, so each player knows the entire state of the game at any point. The possible moves are removing 1 or 4 tokens. Since the players alternate turns, the key is to determine the winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win regardless of the opponent's moves, and a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSince Alice goes first, if the starting position (n) is a losing position, then Bob can win with optimal play. So, I need to find all n \u2264 2024 where n is a losing position.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's define a function W(n) which is true if the current player can win when there are n tokens, and false otherwise. We'll build this up from the base case.\n\nBase cases:\n- If n = 0, the game is over, so the current player loses. So W(0) = False.\n- If n = 1, the current player can take 1 token and win. So W(1) = True.\n- If n = 4, the current player can take 4 tokens and win. So W(4) = True.\n\nNow, for n \u2265 5, the current player can choose to take 1 or 4 tokens. The current player wins if either of the resulting positions (n-1 or n-4) is a losing position for the opponent. So, W(n) = not W(n-1) or not W(n-4). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the current player can choose between taking 1 or 4 tokens. For the current player to have a winning strategy, at least one of the moves must lead to a losing position for the opponent. So, W(n) is true if either W(n-1) is false or W(n-4) is false. So, W(n) = (not W(n-1)) or (not W(n-4)).\n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite accurate. Let me correct this. The current player can choose to take 1 or 4 tokens. So, W(n) is true if either of the following is true: after taking 1 token, the opponent is in a losing position (i.e., W(n-1) is false), or after taking 4 tokens, the opponent is in a losing position (i.e., W(n-4) is false). So, W(n) = (not W(n-1)) or (not W(n-4)).\n\nAlternatively, since if the current player can make a move to a losing position for the opponent, then the current position is a winning position. So, W(n) is true if either W(n-1) is false or W(n-4) is false.\n\nWait, but let's think about it more carefully. For a given n, if the current player can move to a position where the opponent cannot win, then the current position is a winning position. So, W(n) is true if either W(n-1) is false or W(n-4) is false. So, W(n) = (not W(n-1)) or (not W(n-4)).\n\nSo, to compute W(n), I can use this recursive formula.\n\nLet me compute W(n) for small values to see the pattern.\n\nn = 0: W(0) = False (base case)\nn = 1: W(1) = True (take 1 and win)\nn = 2: Can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, which is a winning position for them. So W(2) = (not W(1)) or (not W(-2)). Wait, W(-2) doesn't make sense, so we can ignore it. So W(2) is (not W(1)) which is False. So W(2) = False? Wait, that can't be right. Because if n=2, the current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. So, the current player can't force a win from n=2? Wait, that seems off.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, for n=2, the current player can take 1, leaving n=1. The opponent can then take 1 and win. Alternatively, the current player could take 4, but 4 is more than 2, so that's not possible. So, the only possible move is to take 1, which leaves the opponent in a winning position. So, W(2) should be False, because the current player cannot force a win. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, the current player's options are to take 1 or 4, but if n=2, taking 4 isn't possible, so only taking 1 is possible. So, the current player must take 1, leaving n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So, W(2) = False.\n\nSimilarly, n=3: current player can take 1, leaving n=2 (which is a losing position for the opponent). So, W(3) = True, because the current player can take 1, forcing the opponent into a losing position.\n\nWait, because if n=3, current player takes 1, leaving 2, which is a losing position. So W(3) = True.\n\nn=4: current player can take 4 and win. So W(4)=True.\n\nn=5: current player can take 1, leaving 4 (which is a winning position for the opponent), or take 4, leaving 1 (which is a winning position for the opponent). So, both options leave the opponent in a winning position. So, W(5) = False.\n\nWait, because if current player takes 1, opponent is left with 4, which is a winning position for the opponent. If current player takes 4, opponent is left with 1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So, W(5) is False.\n\nn=6: current player can take 1, leaving 5 (which is a losing position for the opponent), so W(6) = True.\n\nn=7: current player can take 1, leaving 6 (which is a winning position for the opponent), or take 4, leaving 3 (which is a winning position for the opponent). So, both options leave opponent in a winning position. So W(7) = False.\n\nWait, no, wait. If n=7, taking 1 leaves 6, which is a winning position for the opponent. Taking 4 leaves 3, which is a winning position for the opponent. So, the current player cannot force a win, so W(7) = False.\n\nn=8: current player can take 1, leaving 7 (losing for opponent), so W(8) = True.\n\nn=9: current player can take 1, leaving 8 (winning for opponent), or take 4, leaving 5 (losing for opponent). So, if the current player takes 4, opponent is left with 5, which is a losing position. So, W(9) = True.\n\nWait, because taking 4 leaves opponent with 5, which is a losing position, so the current player can win by taking 4. So W(9)=True.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me make a table to keep track.\n\nLet me list n from 0 to, say, 10, and compute W(n):\n\nn | W(n)\n0 | F\n1 | T\n2 | F\n3 | T\n4 | T\n5 | F\n6 | T\n7 | F\n8 | T\n9 | T\n10| ?\n\nWait, let's compute W(5):\n\nn=5: can take 1 (leaves 4, which is T) or take 4 (leaves 1, which is T). So, both options leave opponent in a winning position. So, W(5)=F.\n\nn=6: can take 1 (leaves 5, which is F) or take 4 (leaves 2, which is F). So, taking 1 leads to opponent losing, so W(6)=T.\n\nn=7: can take 1 (leaves 6, T) or take 4 (leaves 3, T). Both options leave opponent in winning positions, so W(7)=F.\n\nn=8: can take 1 (leaves 7, F) or take 4 (leaves 4, T). So, taking 1 leaves opponent in losing position, so W(8)=T.\n\nn=9: can take 1 (leaves 8, T) or take 4 (leaves 5, F). So, taking 4 leaves opponent in losing position, so W(9)=T.\n\nn=10: can take 1 (leaves 9, T) or take 4 (leaves 6, T). Both options leave opponent in winning positions, so W(10)=F.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the losing positions so far are n=0, 2,5,7,10.\n\nHmm, looking at the sequence: 0,2,5,7,10.\n\nWhat's the pattern here? Let's see the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n2-0=2\n\n5-2=3\n\n7-5=2\n\n10-7=3\n\nHmm, so alternately adding 2 and 3. Let me check if this pattern continues.\n\nSo, the next term after 10 would be 10+2=12, then 12+3=15, then 15+2=17, etc.\n\nLet me check n=10: W(10)=F.\n\nn=11: can take 1 (leaves 10, F) or take 4 (leaves 7, F). So, taking 1 leaves opponent in losing position, so W(11)=T.\n\nn=12: can take 1 (leaves 11, T) or take 4 (leaves 8, T). So, both options leave opponent in winning positions, so W(12)=F. So yes, n=12 is a losing position.\n\nn=13: can take 1 (leaves 12, F) or take 4 (leaves 9, T). So, taking 1 leaves opponent in losing position, so W(13)=T.\n\nn=14: can take 1 (leaves 13, T) or take 4 (leaves 10, F). So, taking 4 leaves opponent in losing position, so W(14)=T.\n\nn=15: can take 1 (leaves 14, T) or take 4 (leaves 11, T). Both options leave opponent in winning positions, so W(15)=F.\n\nYes, so n=15 is a losing position, following the pattern 12,15,17, etc.\n\nSo the losing positions are at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25, etc.\n\nLooking at this, it's a repeating pattern every 5? Or perhaps a cycle of adding 2 and 3 alternately.\n\nWait, let's list the losing positions:\n\n0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,30,32,35,37,40,42,...\n\nEach time, adding 2, then 3, then 2, then 3, etc. So the pattern is adding 2,3,2,3,...\n\nSo the losing positions can be described as numbers congruent to 0 mod 5, plus 2, 5, 7, etc. Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as a cycle of 5.\n\nWait, let's see: the losing positions seem to be every 5 numbers, but starting at 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17, etc. Let me see if there's a cycle of 5.\n\nLet me check n=0,5,10,15,20,25,... which are all losing positions, and also 2,7,12,17,22,27,... which are also losing positions.\n\nSo, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 mod 5 and 2 mod 5.\n\nWait, 0 mod 5: 0,5,10,15,20,...\n\n2 mod 5:2,7,12,17,22,27,...\n\nSo, the losing positions are n \u2261 0 mod 5 and n \u2261 2 mod 5.\n\nWait, let's check for n=5: yes, it's a losing position. n=10: yes. n=15: yes. n=20: yes.\n\nn=2: yes, n=7: yes, n=12: yes.\n\nWait, but earlier, n=2: W(2)=F, correct. n=7: W(7)=F, correct. n=12: W(12)=F, correct.\n\nSo, the losing positions are n where n \u2261 0 mod 5 or n \u2261 2 mod 5.\n\nWait, but wait, n=0 is a losing position, but in the problem statement, n is a positive integer, so n starts at 1. So, the losing positions for n \u22651 are n=2,5,7,10,12,15,17, etc., which are 2 mod 5 and 0 mod 5.\n\nSo, for n \u22651, the losing positions are n \u2261 0 mod 5 or n \u2261 2 mod 5.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with n=20: W(20)=F, yes. n=22: let's compute W(22).\n\nn=22: can take 1, leaving 21 (which is W(21)=T?), or take 4, leaving 18 (W(18)=T). So, W(22)=False.\n\nYes, so n=22 is a losing position.\n\nSo, the losing positions are n where n \u2261 0 or 2 mod 5.\n\nSo, the number of losing positions \u22642024 is equal to the number of integers \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5? That's floor(2024/5) + (if 2024 mod5 >=0, add 1 else 0). Wait, no: the count is floor((2024 + (5-0))/5) )? Wait, more accurately, the number of multiples of 5 up to 2024 is floor(2024/5) = 404.8, so 404 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, the numbers \u22612 mod5: the first is 2, then 7, 12,... up to \u22642024.\n\nThe last term would be 2024 if 2024 mod5=2. 2024 divided by 5 is 404*5=2020, so 2024=2020+4, so 2024 mod5=4. So the last term \u22642024 is 2020 +2=2022, which is \u22612 mod5.\n\nSo, the count for \u22612 mod5 is also 405? Wait, let me compute.\n\nThe sequence is 2,7,12,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nThe nth term is 2 +5(n-1) \u22642024.\n\nSo, 5(n-1) \u22642022 \u2192 n-1 \u2264404.4 \u2192 n \u2264405.4, so n=405 terms.\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nThe number of terms \u22612 mod5 up to 2024 is floor((2024 -2)/5) +1 = floor(2022/5) +1 = 404 +1=405.\n\nSimilarly, for \u22610 mod5: 5,10,15,...,2020. The number of terms is 2020/5=404.\n\nSo total losing positions are 405 (for 2 mod5) +404 (for 0 mod5) = 809.\n\nWait, but wait, 2024 is the upper limit. Let me check if 2024 is included.\n\nn=2024: 2024 mod5=2024-5*404=2024-2020=4. So 2024 is not \u22610 or 2 mod5. So the maximum n\u22612 mod5 is 2022, which is 2+5*404=2022.\n\nSo, for \u22612 mod5: 405 terms (from 2 to 2022).\n\nFor \u22610 mod5: 404 terms (from 5 to 2020).\n\nSo total losing positions: 405+404=809.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check:\n\nWait, 2024/5=404.8, so the number of multiples of 5 up to 2024 is 404 (since 5*404=2020 \u22642024).\n\nFor numbers \u22612 mod5: the first is 2, last is 2022=2+5*(404), since 2+5*404=2+2020=2022.\n\nSo the number of terms is 405 (since it starts at 0: 0 to 404, inclusive).\n\nSo, 405 terms for \u22612 mod5 and 404 terms for \u22610 mod5.\n\nTotal losing positions: 405 +404=809.\n\nSo, the answer is 809.\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure that the losing positions are indeed n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nLooking back at the initial terms:\n\nn=0: losing (but n starts at 1, so not counted)\nn=1: winning\nn=2: losing\nn=3: winning\nn=4: winning\nn=5: losing\nn=6: winning\nn=7: losing\nn=8: winning\nn=9: winning\nn=10: losing\nn=11: winning\nn=12: losing\nn=13: winning\nn=14: winning\nn=15: losing\nYes, so it's every 5 numbers, starting at 0,2,5,7,10,12, etc.\n\nSo the pattern holds.\n\nTherefore, the number of losing positions \u22642024 is 809.\n\nWait, but let me compute it again to be sure.\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5 up to 2024: the largest is 2020=5*404. So count is 404.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5 up to 2024: the largest is 2022=2+5*404=2+2020=2022. The count is 405.\n\nSo total is 404+405=809.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n",

So, I need to find all n \u2264 2024 where n is a losing position.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's define a function W(n) which is true if the current player can win when there are n tokens, and false otherwise. We'll build this up from the base case.\n\nBase cases:\n- If n = 0, the game is over, so the current player loses. So W(0) = False.\n- If n = 1, the current player can take 1 token and win. So W(1) = True.\n- If n = 4, the current player can take 4 tokens and win. So W(4) = True.\n\nNow, for n \u2265 5, the current player can choose to take 1 or 4 tokens. The current player wins if either of the resulting positions (n-1 or n-4) is a losing position for the opponent. So, W(n) = not W(n-1) or not W(n-4). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the current player can choose between taking 1 or 4 tokens. For the current player to have a winning strategy, at least one of the moves must lead to a losing position for the opponent. So, W(n) is true if either W(n-1) is false or W(n-4) is false. So, W(n) = (not W(n-1)) or (not W(n-4)).\n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite accurate. Let me correct this. The current player can choose to take 1 or 4 tokens. So, W(n) is true if either of the following is true: after taking 1 token, the opponent is in a losing position (i.e., W(n-1) is false), or after taking 4 tokens, the opponent is in a losing position (i.e., W(n-4) is false). So, W(n) = (not W(n-1)) or (not W(n-4)).\n\nAlternatively, since if the current player can make a move to a losing position for the opponent, then the current position is a winning position. So, W(n) is true if either W(n-1) is false or W(n-4) is false.\n\nWait, but let's think about it more carefully. For a given n, if the current player can move to a position where the opponent cannot win, then the current position is a winning position. So, W(n) is true if either W(n-1) is false or W(n-4) is false. So, W(n) = (not W(n-1)) or (not W(n-4)).\n\nSo, to compute W(n), I can use this recursive formula.\n\nLet me compute W(n) for small values to see the pattern.\n\nn = 0: W(0) = False (base case)\nn = 1: W(1) = True (take 1 and win)\nn = 2: Can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, which is a winning position for them. So W(2) = (not W(1)) or (not W(-2)). Wait, W(-2) doesn't make sense, so we can ignore it. So W(2) is (not W(1)) which is False. So W(2) = False? Wait, that can't be right. Because if n=2, the current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. So, the current player can't force a win from n=2? Wait, that seems off.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, for n=2, the current player can take 1, leaving n=1. The opponent can then take 1 and win. Alternatively, the current player could take 4, but 4 is more than 2, so that's not possible. So, the only possible move is to take 1, which leaves the opponent in a winning position. So, W(2) should be False, because the current player cannot force a win. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, the current player's options are to take 1 or 4, but if n=2, taking 4 isn't possible, so only taking 1 is possible. So, the current player must take 1, leaving n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So, W(2) = False.\n\nSimilarly, n=3: current player can take 1, leaving n=2 (which is a losing position for the opponent). So, W(3) = True, because the current player can take 1, forcing the opponent into a losing position.\n\nWait, because if n=3, current player takes 1, leaving 2, which is a losing position. So W(3) = True.\n\nn=4: current player can take 4 and win. So W(4)=True.\n\nn=5: current player can take 1, leaving 4 (which is a winning position for the opponent), or take 4, leaving 1 (which is a winning position for the opponent). So, both options leave the opponent in a winning position. So, W(5) = False.\n\nWait, because if current player takes 1, opponent is left with 4, which is a winning position for the opponent. If current player takes 4, opponent is left with 1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So, W(5) is False.\n\nn=6: current player can take 1, leaving 5 (which is a losing position for the opponent), so W(6) = True.\n\nn=7: current player can take 1, leaving 6 (which is a winning position for the opponent), or take 4, leaving 3 (which is a winning position for the opponent). So, both options leave opponent in a winning position. So W(7) = False.\n\nWait, no, wait. If n=7, taking 1 leaves 6, which is a winning position for the opponent. Taking 4 leaves 3, which is a winning position for the opponent. So, the current player cannot force a win, so W(7) = False.\n\nn=8: current player can take 1, leaving 7 (losing for opponent), so W(8) = True.\n\nn=9: current player can take 1, leaving 8 (winning for opponent), or take 4, leaving 5 (losing for opponent). So, if the current player takes 4, opponent is left with 5, which is a losing position. So, W(9) = True.\n\nWait, because taking 4 leaves opponent with 5, which is a losing position, so the current player can win by taking 4. So W(9)=True.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me make a table to keep track.\n\nLet me list n from 0 to, say, 10, and compute W(n):\n\nn | W(n)\n0 | F\n1 | T\n2 | F\n3 | T\n4 | T\n5 | F\n6 | T\n7 | F\n8 | T\n9 | T\n10| ?\n\nWait, let's compute W(5):\n\nn=5: can take 1 (leaves 4, which is T) or take 4 (leaves 1, which is T). So, both options leave opponent in a winning position. So, W(5)=F.\n\nn=6: can take 1 (leaves 5, which is F) or take 4 (leaves 2, which is F). So, taking 1 leads to opponent losing, so W(6)=T.\n\nn=7: can take 1 (leaves 6, T) or take 4 (leaves 3, T). Both options leave opponent in winning positions, so W(7)=F.\n\nn=8: can take 1 (leaves 7, F) or take 4 (leaves 4, T). So, taking 1 leaves opponent in losing position, so W(8)=T.\n\nn=9: can take 1 (leaves 8, T) or take 4 (leaves 5, F). So, taking 4 leaves opponent in losing position, so W(9)=T.\n\nn=10: can take 1 (leaves 9, T) or take 4 (leaves 6, T). Both options leave opponent in winning positions, so W(10)=F.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the losing positions so far are n=0, 2,5,7,10.\n\nHmm, looking at the sequence: 0,2,5,7,10.\n\nWhat's the pattern here? Let's see the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n2-0=2\n\n5-2=3\n\n7-5=2\n\n10-7=3\n\nHmm, so alternately adding 2 and 3. Let me check if this pattern continues.\n\nSo, the next term after 10 would be 10+2=12, then 12+3=15, then 15+2=17, etc.\n\nLet me check n=10: W(10)=F.\n\nn=11: can take 1 (leaves 10, F) or take 4 (leaves 7, F). So, taking 1 leaves opponent in losing position, so W(11)=T.\n\nn=12: can take 1 (leaves 11, T) or take 4 (leaves 8, T). So, both options leave opponent in winning positions, so W(12)=F. So yes, n=12 is a losing position.\n\nn=13: can take 1 (leaves 12, F) or take 4 (leaves 9, T). So, taking 1 leaves opponent in losing position, so W(13)=T.\n\nn=14: can take 1 (leaves 13, T) or take 4 (leaves 10, F). So, taking 4 leaves opponent in losing position, so W(14)=T.\n\nn=15: can take 1 (leaves 14, T) or take 4 (leaves 11, T). Both options leave opponent in winning positions, so W(15)=F.\n\nYes, so n=15 is a losing position, following the pattern 12,15,17, etc.\n\nSo the losing positions are at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25, etc.\n\nLooking at this, it's a repeating pattern every 5? Or perhaps a cycle of adding 2 and 3 alternately.\n\nWait, let's list the losing positions:\n\n0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,30,32,35,37,40,42,...\n\nEach time, adding 2, then 3, then 2, then 3, etc. So the pattern is adding 2,3,2,3,...\n\nSo the losing positions can be described as numbers congruent to 0 mod 5, plus 2, 5, 7, etc. Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as a cycle of 5.\n\nWait, let's see: the losing positions seem to be every 5 numbers, but starting at 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17, etc. Let me see if there's a cycle of 5.\n\nLet me check n=0,5,10,15,20,25,... which are all losing positions, and also 2,7,12,17,22,27,... which are also losing positions.\n\nSo, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 mod 5 and 2 mod 5.\n\nWait, 0 mod 5: 0,5,10,15,20,...\n\n2 mod 5:2,7,12,17,22,27,...\n\nSo, the losing positions are n \u2261 0 mod 5 and n \u2261 2 mod 5.\n\nWait, let's check for n=5: yes, it's a losing position. n=10: yes. n=15: yes. n=20: yes.\n\nn=2: yes, n=7: yes, n=12: yes.\n\nWait, but earlier, n=2: W(2)=F, correct. n=7: W(7)=F, correct. n=12: W(12)=F, correct.\n\nSo, the losing positions are n where n \u2261 0 mod 5 or n \u2261 2 mod 5.\n\nWait, but wait, n=0 is a losing position, but in the problem statement, n is a positive integer, so n starts at 1. So, the losing positions for n \u22651 are n=2,5,7,10,12,15,17, etc., which are 2 mod 5 and 0 mod 5.\n\nSo, for n \u22651, the losing positions are n \u2261 0 mod 5 or n \u2261 2 mod 5.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with n=20: W(20)=F, yes. n=22: let's compute W(22).\n\nn=22: can take 1, leaving 21 (which is W(21)=T?), or take 4, leaving 18 (W(18)=T). So, W(22)=False.\n\nYes, so n=22 is a losing position.\n\nSo, the losing positions are n where n \u2261 0 or 2 mod 5.\n\nSo, the number of losing positions \u22642024 is equal to the number of integers \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5? That's floor(2024/5) + (if 2024 mod5 >=0, add 1 else 0). Wait, no: the count is floor((2024 + (5-0))/5) )? Wait, more accurately, the number of multiples of 5 up to 2024 is floor(2024/5) = 404.8, so 404 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, the numbers \u22612 mod5: the first is 2, then 7, 12,... up to \u22642024.\n\nThe last term would be 2024 if 2024 mod5=2. 2024 divided by 5 is 404*5=2020, so 2024=2020+4, so 2024 mod5=4. So the last term \u22642024 is 2020 +2=2022, which is \u22612 mod5.\n\nSo, the count for \u22612 mod5 is also 405? Wait, let me compute.\n\nThe sequence is 2,7,12,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nThe nth term is 2 +5(n-1) \u22642024.\n\nSo, 5(n-1) \u22642022 \u2192 n-1 \u2264404.4 \u2192 n \u2264405.4, so n=405 terms.\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nThe number of terms \u22612 mod5 up to 2024 is floor((2024 -2)/5) +1 = floor(2022/5) +1 = 404 +1=405.\n\nSimilarly, for \u22610 mod5: 5,10,15,...,2020. The number of terms is 2020/5=404.\n\nSo total losing positions are 405 (for 2 mod5) +404 (for 0 mod5) = 809.\n\nWait, but wait, 2024 is the upper limit. Let me check if 2024 is included.\n\nn=2024: 2024 mod5=2024-5*404=2024-2020=4. So 2024 is not \u22610 or 2 mod5. So the maximum n\u22612 mod5 is 2022, which is 2+5*404=2022.\n\nSo, for \u22612 mod5: 405 terms (from 2 to 2022).\n\nFor \u22610 mod5: 404 terms (from 5 to 2020).\n\nSo total losing positions: 405+404=809.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check:\n\nWait, 2024/5=404.8, so the number of multiples of 5 up to 2024 is 404 (since 5*404=2020 \u22642024).\n\nFor numbers \u22612 mod5: the first is 2, last is 2022=2+5*(404), since 2+5*404=2+2020=2022.\n\nSo the number of terms is 405 (since it starts at 0: 0 to 404, inclusive).\n\nSo, 405 terms for \u22612 mod5 and 404 terms for \u22610 mod5.\n\nTotal losing positions: 405 +404=809.\n\nSo, the answer is 809.\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure that the losing positions are indeed n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nLooking back at the initial terms:\n\nn=0: losing (but n starts at 1, so not counted)\nn=1: winning\nn=2: losing\nn=3: winning\nn=4: winning\nn=5: losing\nn=6: winning\nn=7: losing\nn=8: winning\nn=9: winning\nn=10: losing\nn=11: winning\nn=12: losing\nn=13: winning\nn=14: winning\nn=15: losing\nYes, so it's every 5 numbers, starting at 0,2,5,7,10,12, etc.\n\nSo the pattern holds.\n\nTherefore, the number of losing positions \u22642024 is 809.\n\nWait, but let me compute it again to be sure.\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5 up to 2024: the largest is 2020=5*404. So count is 404.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5 up to 2024: the largest is 2022=2+5*404=2+2020=2022. The count is 405.\n\nSo total is 404+405=809.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) where Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game's winning and losing positions. A losing position is one where the current player cannot force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves.\n\nWe define \\( W(n) \\) as true if the current player can win with \\( n \\) tokens, and false otherwise. The base cases are:\n- \\( W(0) = \\text{False} \\) (game over, current player loses),\n- \\( W(1) = \\text{True} \\) (take 1 token and win),\n- \\( W(4) = \\text{True} \\) (take 4 tokens and win).\n\nFor \\( n \\geq 5 \\), \\( W(n) \\) is true if either \\( W(n-1) \\) or \\( W(n-4) \\) is false, meaning the current player can move to a losing position for the opponent.\n\nBy computing \\( W(n) \\) for small values, we observe a pattern: losing positions occur at \\( n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\) and \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\). This pattern holds for all \\( n \\geq 0 \\).\n\nTo find the count of such \\( n \\leq 2024 \\):\n- Numbers \\( \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\): The largest is 2020, giving \\( \\lfloor 2024/5 \\rfloor = 404 \\) terms.\n- Numbers \\( \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\): The largest is 2022, giving \\( \\lfloor (2024 - 2)/5 \\rfloor + 1 = 405 \\) terms.\n\nThus, the total number of losing positions is \\( 404 + 405 = 809 \\).\n\n\\boxed{809}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. Each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. It's a combinatorial game, so maybe I can model it using the concept of winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, regardless of what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite\u2014no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, the key is to figure out for each n whether it's a winning or losing position for the player about to move. Since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position for the first player, then Bob can win with optimal play.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern or a recurrence relation.\n\nLet's define P(n) as true if the current player can force a win from n tokens, and false otherwise.\n\nBase cases:\n- P(0): If there are no tokens left, the player can't move, so they lose. So P(0) = false.\n- P(1): The player can take 1 token and win. So P(1) = true.\n- P(2): The player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Wait, but if I take 1 from 2, leaving 1, the opponent can take that 1 and win. So P(2) would be false? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, current player takes 1, leaves 1. Next player takes 1 and wins. So current player cannot force a win. So P(2)=false. Alternatively, can current player take 4 tokens? No, because n=2 <4. So P(2)=false.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the Grundy numbers or mex (minimum excludant). But perhaps a simpler approach would be to list out the positions step by step.\n\nLet's list P(n) for n from 0 upwards.\n\nn | P(n)\n0 | False (losing)\n1 | True (win by taking 1)\n2 | ?\n3 | ?\n4 | True (take 4 and win)\n5 | ?\n6 | ?\n7 | ?\n8 | ?\n\nWait, let's compute each step:\n\nn=0: False (losing)\nn=1: You can take 1, leaving 0 for opponent, who loses. So P(1)=True.\n\nn=2: You can take 1, leaving 1. Opponent can then take 1 and win. So if you take 1, opponent wins. Alternatively, can you take 4? No, n=2 <4. So only option is to take 1, which leads to opponent's win. So P(2)=False.\n\nn=3: You can take 1, leaving 2. Since P(2)=False, opponent is in a losing position. So you can force a win. So P(3)=True.\n\nWait, so if you take 1 from 3, leaving 2, which is a losing position for the opponent. So yes, P(3)=True.\n\nn=4: You can take 4 and win. So P(4)=True.\n\nn=5: You can take 1, leaving 4. P(4)=True, so opponent can win. Or take 4, leaving 1. P(1)=True, opponent can win. So both options leave opponent in a winning position. So P(5)=False.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because from n=5, if I take 1, opponent gets 4, which is a winning position for them. So opponent can take 4 and win. Similarly, if I take 4, opponent gets 1, which is a winning position. So yeah, P(5)=False.\n\nn=6: Let's see. Possible moves: take 1, leaving 5 (P(5)=False), or take 4, leaving 2 (P(2)=False). So if I take 1, opponent is left with 5, which is a losing position for them. So I can force a win. So P(6)=True.\n\nn=7: Take 1, leaving 6 (P(6)=True), opponent can win. Take 4, leaving 3 (P(3)=True), opponent can win. So both moves lead to opponent's win. So P(7)=False.\n\nWait, but wait, n=7, if I take 1, opponent gets 6, which is a winning position. So opponent can take 1, leaving me with 5, which is a losing position. So P(7)=False.\n\nn=8: Let's see. Take 1, leaving 7 (P(7)=False). So opponent is in a losing position. So P(8)=True.\n\nn=9: Take 1, leaving 8 (P(8)=True). Or take 4, leaving 5 (P(5)=False). So if I take 4, opponent is left with 5, which is a losing position. So P(9)=True.\n\nWait, wait, if I can take 4, leaving 5, which is losing for opponent, then P(9)=True.\n\nn=10: Take 1, leaving 9 (P(9)=True). Take 4, leaving 6 (P(6)=True). Both moves leave opponent in a winning position. So P(10)=False.\n\nn=11: Take 1, leaving 10 (P(10)=False). So opponent is in a losing position. So P(11)=True.\n\nn=12: Take 1, leaving 11 (P(11)=True). Take 4, leaving 8 (P(8)=True). So both moves leave opponent in a winning position. So P(12)=False.\n\nn=13: Take 1, leaving 12 (P(12)=False). So opponent is in a losing position. So P(13)=True.\n\nn=14: Take 1, leaving 13 (P(13)=True). Take 4, leaving 10 (P(10)=False). So if I take 4, opponent is left with 10, which is a losing position. So P(14)=True.\n\nWait, so n=14: P(14)=True.\n\nn=15: Take 1, leaving 14 (P(14)=True). Take 4, leaving 11 (P(11)=True). Both moves leave opponent in a winning position. So P(15)=False.\n\nn=16: Take 1, leaving 15 (P(15)=False). So opponent is in a losing position. So P(16)=True.\n\nHmm, let me list these out:\n\nn : P(n)\n0 : F\n1 : T\n2 : F\n3 : T\n4 : T\n5 : F\n6 : T\n7 : F\n8 : T\n9 : T\n10: F\n11: T\n12: F\n13: T\n14: T\n15: F\n16: T\n\nLooking for a pattern here. Let's see the losing positions so far: n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15.\n\nHmm, let's see the differences between them:\n\nFrom 0 to 2: +2\n2 to 5: +3\n5 to 7: +2\n7 to 10: +3\n10 to 12: +2\n12 to 15: +3\n15 to 17: would be +2, but let's compute a few more to check.\n\nn=17: Take 1, leaving 16 (P= T). Take 4, leaving 13 (P=T). So both options leave opponent in a winning position. So P(17)=False.\n\nn=18: Take 1, leaving 17 (P=F). So P(18)=True.\n\nn=19: Take 1, leaving 18 (T). Take 4, leaving 15 (F). So taking 4 leaves opponent in a losing position. So P(19)=True.\n\nn=20: Take 1, leaving 19 (T). Take 4, leaving 16 (T). So P(20)=False.\n\nSo adding to the list:\n\nn=17: F\nn=18: T\nn=19: T\nn=20: F\n\nSo the losing positions are 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nLooking for a pattern. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the losing positions:\n\n0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nLooking at the sequence, perhaps it's every 5 numbers?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nDifferences between consecutive terms:\n\n2,3,2,3,2,3,2,3,...\n\nSo the pattern is +2, +3, +2, +3, etc.\n\nSo the losing positions are numbers that can be expressed as starting from 0 and adding 2, then 3, then 2, then 3, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can be written in a certain arithmetic progression.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0,2,5 mod 7? Let's check.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n0 mod 7: 0\n2 mod 7: 2\n5 mod7:5\n7 mod7:0\n10 mod7:3\n12 mod7:5\n15 mod7:1\n17 mod7:3\n20 mod7:6\nHmm, that doesn't seem to fit. So maybe not mod7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the losing positions are numbers where n mod 6 is 0,2,3,5? Not sure.\n\nWait, let's see the losing positions up to n=20:\n\n0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20.\n\nLet me see if these numbers can be expressed as 5k, 5k+2, or 5k+ something else.\n\nWait, 0=5*0\n2=5*0 +2\n5=5*1\n7=5*1 +2\n10=5*2\n12=5*2 +2\n15=5*3\n17=5*3 +2\n20=5*4\nSo the losing positions are numbers of the form 5k and 5k+2, where k is a non-negative integer.\n\nWait, let's check if that holds beyond n=20.\n\nn=21: Let's compute P(21).\n\nn=21: Take 1, leaving 20 (P=F). So opponent is in a losing position. So P(21)=True.\n\nn=22: Take 1, leaving 21 (T). Take 4, leaving 18 (T). So P(22)=False? Wait, no, wait. If I take 4 from 22, I get 18, which is P(18)=True. So opponent can win. If I take 1, opponent gets 21 (P=T). So both options leave opponent in a winning position. So P(22)=False.\n\nBut according to the earlier pattern, 22=5*4 + 2=22. So according to that, 22 should be a losing position. So yes, P(22)=False.\n\nn=23: Take 1, leaving 22 (F). So opponent is in losing position. So P(23)=True.\n\nn=24: Take 1, leaving 23 (T). Take 4, leaving 20 (F). So if I take 4, opponent is left with 20, which is a losing position. So P(24)=True.\n\nn=25: Take 1, leaving 24 (T). Take 4, leaving 21 (T). So both options leave opponent in a winning position. So P(25)=False. 25=5*5, which fits the pattern.\n\nn=26: Take 1, leaving 25 (F). So opponent is in losing position. So P(26)=True.\n\nn=27: Take 1, leaving 26 (T). Take 4, leaving 23 (T). So P(27)=False? Wait, no. Wait, 27: taking 1 leaves 26 (P=T), opponent can win. Taking 4 leaves 23 (P=T), opponent can win. So P(27)=False. But according to the pattern, 27=5*5 +2=27. So 27 is a losing position. So yes, P(27)=False.\n\nn=28: Take 1, leaving 27 (F). So opponent is in a losing position. So P(28)=True.\n\nn=29: Take 1, leaving 28 (T). Take 4, leaving 25 (F). So if I take 4, opponent is left with 25, which is losing. So P(29)=True.\n\nn=30: Take 1, leaving 29 (T). Take 4, leaving 26 (T). So P(30)=False. 30=5*6, which fits the pattern.\n\nSo yes, the losing positions are n=5k and n=5k+2, for k\u22650.\n\nSo for n=5k or n=5k+2, P(n)=False (losing positions for the current player). So if n is a losing position, then the current player can't force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.\n\nIn our problem, Alice goes first. So for Bob to have a winning strategy, n must be a losing position for Alice. Because then, no matter what Alice does, Bob can force a win.\n\nSo the losing positions are n=5k and n=5k+2.\n\nSo now, we need to count the number of positive integers n \u22642024 where n is congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.\n\nSo how many such numbers are there?\n\nWe can compute the count for n\u22610 mod5 and n\u22612 mod5.\n\nFirst, for n\u22610 mod5:\n\nThe numbers are 5,10,15,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nSimilarly, for n\u22612 mod5: 2,7,12,17,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nLet's compute the number of terms in each sequence.\n\nFor n\u22610 mod5:\n\nThe first term is 5, last term \u22642024 is 2020 (since 2020=5*404).\n\nNumber of terms: 404.\n\nFor n\u22612 mod5:\n\nFirst term is 2, last term \u22642024 is 2022 (since 2022=5*404 +2).\n\nWait, let's check 2022: 5*404=2020, 2020+2=2022.\n\nNumber of terms: Let's see, the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with first term a=2, common difference d=5.\n\nNumber of terms: Let\u2019s use the formula for the nth term: a_n = a + (n-1)*d.\n\nSo 2022=2 + (n-1)*5.\n\n2022-2= (n-1)*5 \u2192 2020=5(n-1) \u2192 n-1=404 \u2192 n=405.\n\nSo for n\u22612 mod5, there are 405 terms.\n\nSo total losing positions \u22642024: 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but wait: when n=0, it's a losing position, but n must be positive. So in our earlier count, n=5k: starts at 5, so 5,10,...2020: 404 numbers.\n\nn=5k+2: starts at 2, ends at 2022: 405 numbers.\n\nSo total is 404+405=809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check:\n\nFor n\u22610 mod5:\n\nNumbers are 5,10,...,2020.\n\nNumber of terms: floor(2024/5)=404.8 \u2192 404 terms.\n\nFor n\u22612 mod5:\n\nNumbers are 2,7,...,2022.\n\nCompute (2022 -2)/5 +1= (2020)/5 +1=404+1=405.\n\nSo total is 404+405=809.\n\nBut wait, let me check if 2022 is indeed the last term in n\u22612 mod5.\n\n2024 divided by 5: 2024=5*404 +4.\n\nSo 5*404=2020. 2020+2=2022. 2022+5=2027>2024, so 2022 is indeed the last term.\n\nSo yes, 405 terms.\n\nSo total number of losing positions is 809.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me think about n=0. n must be positive, so n=0 is not included. So in our count for n\u22610 mod5, we start at 5, so 404 terms. For n\u22612 mod5, we start at 2, so 405 terms. So total is 809.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 809.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with the initial terms.\n\nEarlier, for n=0 to 20, the losing positions were 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20.\n\nBut n must be positive, so starting from 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nWait, so n=2 is included in the count. So our initial calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive integers n\u22642024 where Bob can guarantee a win is 809.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. Each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. It's a combinatorial game, so maybe I can model it using the concept of winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, regardless of what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite\u2014no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, the key is to figure out for each n whether it's a winning or losing position for the player about to move. Since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position for the first player, then Bob can win with optimal play.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern or a recurrence relation.\n\nLet's define P(n) as true if the current player can force a win from n tokens, and false otherwise.\n\nBase cases:\n- P(0): If there are no tokens left, the player can't move, so they lose. So P(0) = false.\n- P(1): The player can take 1 token and win. So P(1) = true.\n- P(2): The player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Wait, but if I take 1 from 2, leaving 1, the opponent can take that 1 and win. So P(2) would be false? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, current player takes 1, leaves 1. Next player takes 1 and wins. So current player cannot force a win. So P(2)=false. Alternatively, can current player take 4 tokens? No, because n=2 <4. So P(2)=false.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the Grundy numbers or mex (minimum excludant). But perhaps a simpler approach would be to list out the positions step by step.\n\nLet's list P(n) for n from 0 upwards.\n\nn | P(n)\n0 | False (losing)\n1 | True (win by taking 1)\n2 | ?\n3 | ?\n4 | True (take 4 and win)\n5 | ?\n6 | ?\n7 | ?\n8 | ?\n\nWait, let's compute each step:\n\nn=0: False (losing)\nn=1: You can take 1, leaving 0 for opponent, who loses. So P(1)=True.\n\nn=2: You can take 1, leaving 1. Opponent can then take 1 and win. So if you take 1, opponent wins. Alternatively, can you take 4? No, n=2 <4. So only option is to take 1, which leads to opponent's win. So P(2)=False.\n\nn=3: You can take 1, leaving 2. Since P(2)=False, opponent is in a losing position. So you can force a win. So P(3)=True.\n\nWait, so if you take 1 from 3, leaving 2, which is a losing position for the opponent. So yes, P(3)=True.\n\nn=4: You can take 4 and win. So P(4)=True.\n\nn=5: You can take 1, leaving 4. P(4)=True, so opponent can win. Or take 4, leaving 1. P(1)=True, opponent can win. So both options leave opponent in a winning position. So P(5)=False.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because from n=5, if I take 1, opponent gets 4, which is a winning position for them. So opponent can take 4 and win. Similarly, if I take 4, opponent gets 1, which is a winning position. So yeah, P(5)=False.\n\nn=6: Let's see. Possible moves: take 1, leaving 5 (P(5)=False), or take 4, leaving 2 (P(2)=False). So if I take 1, opponent is left with 5, which is a losing position for them. So I can force a win. So P(6)=True.\n\nn=7: Take 1, leaving 6 (P(6)=True), opponent can win. Take 4, leaving 3 (P(3)=True), opponent can win. So both moves lead to opponent's win. So P(7)=False.\n\nWait, but wait, n=7, if I take 1, opponent gets 6, which is a winning position. So opponent can take 1, leaving me with 5, which is a losing position. So P(7)=False.\n\nn=8: Let's see. Take 1, leaving 7 (P(7)=False). So opponent is in a losing position. So P(8)=True.\n\nn=9: Take 1, leaving 8 (P(8)=True). Or take 4, leaving 5 (P(5)=False). So if I take 4, opponent is left with 5, which is a losing position. So P(9)=True.\n\nWait, wait, if I can take 4, leaving 5, which is losing for opponent, then P(9)=True.\n\nn=10: Take 1, leaving 9 (P(9)=True). Take 4, leaving 6 (P(6)=True). Both moves leave opponent in a winning position. So P(10)=False.\n\nn=11: Take 1, leaving 10 (P(10)=False). So opponent is in a losing position. So P(11)=True.\n\nn=12: Take 1, leaving 11 (P(11)=True). Take 4, leaving 8 (P(8)=True). So both moves leave opponent in a winning position. So P(12)=False.\n\nn=13: Take 1, leaving 12 (P(12)=False). So opponent is in a losing position. So P(13)=True.\n\nn=14: Take 1, leaving 13 (P(13)=True). Take 4, leaving 10 (P(10)=False). So if I take 4, opponent is left with 10, which is a losing position. So P(14)=True.\n\nWait, so n=14: P(14)=True.\n\nn=15: Take 1, leaving 14 (P(14)=True). Take 4, leaving 11 (P(11)=True). Both moves leave opponent in a winning position. So P(15)=False.\n\nn=16: Take 1, leaving 15 (P(15)=False). So opponent is in a losing position. So P(16)=True.\n\nHmm, let me list these out:\n\nn : P(n)\n0 : F\n1 : T\n2 : F\n3 : T\n4 : T\n5 : F\n6 : T\n7 : F\n8 : T\n9 : T\n10: F\n11: T\n12: F\n13: T\n14: T\n15: F\n16: T\n\nLooking for a pattern here. Let's see the losing positions so far: n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15.\n\nHmm, let's see the differences between them:\n\nFrom 0 to 2: +2\n2 to 5: +3\n5 to 7: +2\n7 to 10: +3\n10 to 12: +2\n12 to 15: +3\n15 to 17: would be +2, but let's compute a few more to check.\n\nn=17: Take 1, leaving 16 (P= T). Take 4, leaving 13 (P=T). So both options leave opponent in a winning position. So P(17)=False.\n\nn=18: Take 1, leaving 17 (P=F). So P(18)=True.\n\nn=19: Take 1, leaving 18 (T). Take 4, leaving 15 (F). So taking 4 leaves opponent in a losing position. So P(19)=True.\n\nn=20: Take 1, leaving 19 (T). Take 4, leaving 16 (T). So P(20)=False.\n\nSo adding to the list:\n\nn=17: F\nn=18: T\nn=19: T\nn=20: F\n\nSo the losing positions are 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nLooking for a pattern. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the losing positions:\n\n0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nLooking at the sequence, perhaps it's every 5 numbers?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nDifferences between consecutive terms:\n\n2,3,2,3,2,3,2,3,...\n\nSo the pattern is +2, +3, +2, +3, etc.\n\nSo the losing positions are numbers that can be expressed as starting from 0 and adding 2, then 3, then 2, then 3, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can be written in a certain arithmetic progression.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0,2,5 mod 7? Let's check.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n0 mod 7: 0\n2 mod 7: 2\n5 mod7:5\n7 mod7:0\n10 mod7:3\n12 mod7:5\n15 mod7:1\n17 mod7:3\n20 mod7:6\nHmm, that doesn't seem to fit. So maybe not mod7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the losing positions are numbers where n mod 6 is 0,2,3,5? Not sure.\n\nWait, let's see the losing positions up to n=20:\n\n0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20.\n\nLet me see if these numbers can be expressed as 5k, 5k+2, or 5k+ something else.\n\nWait, 0=5*0\n2=5*0 +2\n5=5*1\n7=5*1 +2\n10=5*2\n12=5*2 +2\n15=5*3\n17=5*3 +2\n20=5*4\nSo the losing positions are numbers of the form 5k and 5k+2, where k is a non-negative integer.\n\nWait, let's check if that holds beyond n=20.\n\nn=21: Let's compute P(21).\n\nn=21: Take 1, leaving 20 (P=F). So opponent is in a losing position. So P(21)=True.\n\nn=22: Take 1, leaving 21 (T). Take 4, leaving 18 (T). So P(22)=False? Wait, no, wait. If I take 4 from 22, I get 18, which is P(18)=True. So opponent can win. If I take 1, opponent gets 21 (P=T). So both options leave opponent in a winning position. So P(22)=False.\n\nBut according to the earlier pattern, 22=5*4 + 2=22. So according to that, 22 should be a losing position. So yes, P(22)=False.\n\nn=23: Take 1, leaving 22 (F). So opponent is in losing position. So P(23)=True.\n\nn=24: Take 1, leaving 23 (T). Take 4, leaving 20 (F). So if I take 4, opponent is left with 20, which is a losing position. So P(24)=True.\n\nn=25: Take 1, leaving 24 (T). Take 4, leaving 21 (T). So both options leave opponent in a winning position. So P(25)=False. 25=5*5, which fits the pattern.\n\nn=26: Take 1, leaving 25 (F). So opponent is in losing position. So P(26)=True.\n\nn=27: Take 1, leaving 26 (T). Take 4, leaving 23 (T). So P(27)=False? Wait, no. Wait, 27: taking 1 leaves 26 (P=T), opponent can win. Taking 4 leaves 23 (P=T), opponent can win. So P(27)=False. But according to the pattern, 27=5*5 +2=27. So 27 is a losing position. So yes, P(27)=False.\n\nn=28: Take 1, leaving 27 (F). So opponent is in a losing position. So P(28)=True.\n\nn=29: Take 1, leaving 28 (T). Take 4, leaving 25 (F). So if I take 4, opponent is left with 25, which is losing. So P(29)=True.\n\nn=30: Take 1, leaving 29 (T). Take 4, leaving 26 (T). So P(30)=False. 30=5*6, which fits the pattern.\n\nSo yes, the losing positions are n=5k and n=5k+2, for k\u22650.\n\nSo for n=5k or n=5k+2, P(n)=False (losing positions for the current player). So if n is a losing position, then the current player can't force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.\n\nIn our problem, Alice goes first. So for Bob to have a winning strategy, n must be a losing position for Alice. Because then, no matter what Alice does, Bob can force a win.\n\nSo the losing positions are n=5k and n=5k+2.\n\nSo now, we need to count the number of positive integers n \u22642024 where n is congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.\n\nSo how many such numbers are there?\n\nWe can compute the count for n\u22610 mod5 and n\u22612 mod5.\n\nFirst, for n\u22610 mod5:\n\nThe numbers are 5,10,15,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nSimilarly, for n\u22612 mod5: 2,7,12,17,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nLet's compute the number of terms in each sequence.\n\nFor n\u22610 mod5:\n\nThe first term is 5, last term \u22642024 is 2020 (since 2020=5*404).\n\nNumber of terms: 404.\n\nFor n\u22612 mod5:\n\nFirst term is 2, last term \u22642024 is 2022 (since 2022=5*404 +2).\n\nWait, let's check 2022: 5*404=2020, 2020+2=2022.\n\nNumber of terms: Let's see, the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with first term a=2, common difference d=5.\n\nNumber of terms: Let\u2019s use the formula for the nth term: a_n = a + (n-1)*d.\n\nSo 2022=2 + (n-1)*5.\n\n2022-2= (n-1)*5 \u2192 2020=5(n-1) \u2192 n-1=404 \u2192 n=405.\n\nSo for n\u22612 mod5, there are 405 terms.\n\nSo total losing positions \u22642024: 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but wait: when n=0, it's a losing position, but n must be positive. So in our earlier count, n=5k: starts at 5, so 5,10,...2020: 404 numbers.\n\nn=5k+2: starts at 2, ends at 2022: 405 numbers.\n\nSo total is 404+405=809.\n\nWait, but let me double-check:\n\nFor n\u22610 mod5:\n\nNumbers are 5,10,...,2020.\n\nNumber of terms: floor(2024/5)=404.8 \u2192 404 terms.\n\nFor n\u22612 mod5:\n\nNumbers are 2,7,...,2022.\n\nCompute (2022 -2)/5 +1= (2020)/5 +1=404+1=405.\n\nSo total is 404+405=809.\n\nBut wait, let me check if 2022 is indeed the last term in n\u22612 mod5.\n\n2024 divided by 5: 2024=5*404 +4.\n\nSo 5*404=2020. 2020+2=2022. 2022+5=2027>2024, so 2022 is indeed the last term.\n\nSo yes, 405 terms.\n\nSo total number of losing positions is 809.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me think about n=0. n must be positive, so n=0 is not included. So in our count for n\u22610 mod5, we start at 5, so 404 terms. For n\u22612 mod5, we start at 2, so 405 terms. So total is 809.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 809.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with the initial terms.\n\nEarlier, for n=0 to 20, the losing positions were 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20.\n\nBut n must be positive, so starting from 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nWait, so n=2 is included in the count. So our initial calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive integers n\u22642024 where Bob can guarantee a win is 809.\n\n\nAlice and Bob play a game with a stack of \\( n \\) tokens, taking turns to remove either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first, and the player who removes the last token wins. To determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) where Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game using winning and losing positions.\n\nA losing position is one where the current player cannot force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves.

Specifically, these are \\( n = 5k \\) and \\( n = 5k + 2 \\) for non-negative integers \\( k \\).\n\nTo count the number of such \\( n \\) up to \\( 2024 \\):\n\n1. **For \\( n \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\):** The sequence starts at \\( 5 \\) and ends at \\( 2020 \\).

The number of terms is \\( \\frac{2022 - 2}{5} + 1 = 405 \\).\n\nAdding these, the total number of losing positions is \\( 404 + 405 = 809 \\).\n\nThus, the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) where Bob can guarantee a win is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{809}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember these involve determining winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. So, if Bob can force a win, that means n is a losing position for Alice, right?\n\nWait, no. Because Alice goes first. So if n is a losing position for the first player, then Bob can win. So I need to find all n \u2264 2024 where n is a losing position for the first player (Alice), meaning Bob can win.\n\nSo the key is to find all such n where the first player (Alice) cannot win, given optimal play by Bob.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Maybe I can use dynamic programming to determine for each n whether it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position.\n\nLet's define:\n- W: winning position (current player can force a win)\n- L: losing position (current player will lose if opponent plays optimally)\n\nThe base case is when n=0. If there are no tokens left, the game is over, so the player who just moved wins. So n=0 is a losing position for the player about to move because they can't make a move.\n\nWait, no. Because the last player to move wins. So if n=0, the game is over, so the player about to move loses because they can't take any tokens.\n\nSo the base case:\nn=0: L\n\nNow, for n=1: the current player can take 1 token and win, so it's a W.\nn=2: current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, which is a W position for them. Wait, no\u2014if I take 1, opponent is left with n=1, which is a W position for them, meaning they can win. So n=2: if I take 1, opponent can take 1 and win. Alternatively, can I take 4? No, because n=2 <4. So I can only take 1. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position for me, so it's L.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. When n=2, the current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent. n=1 is a W position for the opponent, meaning they can win from there. So n=2: all possible moves lead to opponent's W. So n=2 is L.\n\nSimilarly, n=3: current player can take 1, leaving n=2, which is L. So opponent is in a losing position, meaning n=3 is W.\n\nn=4: current player can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So n=4 is W.\n\nn=5: current player can take 1, leaving n=4 (W for opponent), or take 4, leaving n=1 (W for opponent). So all moves lead to opponent's W. So n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: current player can take 1, leaving n=5 (L for opponent). So opponent is in a losing position. Therefore, n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: current player can take 1, leaving n=6 (W), or take 4, leaving n=3 (W). So all moves lead to opponent's W. So n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: take 1, leaving n=7 (L). So opponent is in losing position. So n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: take 1, leaving n=8 (W), or take 4, leaving n=5 (L). So if I take 4, opponent is left with n=5 (L). So n=9 is W.\n\nWait, no. Wait, n=9: taking 4 leaves n=5, which is L. So opponent cannot win from n=5. So n=9 is W.\n\nWait, let me make a table for n=0 to, say, 10 to see the pattern.\n\nn | outcome\n0 | L\n1 | W\n2 | L\n3 | W\n4 | W\n5 | L\n6 | W\n7 | L\n8 | W\n9 | W\n10| ?\n\nn=10: possible moves are to n=9 (W) and n=6 (W). So all moves lead to opponent's W. So n=10 is L.\n\nWait, so let's list them:\n\nn : outcome\n\n0 : L\n\n1 : W (take 1)\n\n2 : L (only move to W)\n\n3 : W (take 1 to L)\n\n4 : W (take 4)\n\n5 : L (moves to W and W)\n\n6 : W (take 1 to L)\n\n7 : L (moves to W and W)\n\n8 : W (take 1 to L)\n\n9 : W (take 4 to L)\n\n10: L (moves to W and W)\n\nHmm, looking for a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the sequence of outcomes:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nOutc: L W L W W L W L W W L\n\nSo, the pattern is L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L...\n\nIs there a cycle here? Let me see.\n\nLooking from n=0:\n\n0: L\n\n1: W\n\n2: L\n\n3: W\n\n4: W\n\n5: L\n\n6: W\n\n7: L\n\n8: W\n\n9: W\n\n10: L\n\n11: ?\n\nn=11: possible moves to n=10 (L) and n=7 (L). Wait, if I take 1, opponent gets n=10 (L). If I take 4, opponent gets n=7 (L). So both moves leave opponent in L. So n=11 is W.\n\nWait, but wait: if I'm at n=11, taking 1 leaves opponent at n=10 (L), so opponent cannot win. So I can force a win by taking 1. So n=11 is W.\n\nn=12: possible moves to n=11 (W) and n=8 (W). So all moves lead to opponent's W. So n=12 is L.\n\nn=13: take 1 to n=12 (L), so n=13 is W.\n\nn=14: take 4 to n=10 (L), so n=14 is W.\n\nn=15: possible moves to n=14 (W) and n=11 (W). So n=15 is L.\n\nHmm, let me list up to n=15.\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n\nOutc: L W L W W L W L W W L W L W W L\n\nWait, so from n=0 to n=15, the pattern repeats every 5? Or is it a longer cycle?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLooking at the positions where it's L: n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,...\n\nLooking at the differences between these:\n\n2-0=2\n\n5-2=3\n\n7-5=2\n\n10-7=3\n\n12-10=2\n\n15-12=3\n\nSo alternates between adding 2 and 3. So the losing positions are at 0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... etc.\n\nSo the losing positions follow a pattern where each losing position is previous +2, then +3, repeating.\n\nSo the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17, etc.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if the losing positions can be described by a mathematical formula.\n\nLooking at the losing positions:\n\nn: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,...\n\nLet me see the pattern.\n\nLooking at the sequence: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nEach time, it's adding 2, then 3, alternately.\n\nSo the sequence can be generated by starting at 0, then adding 2, then 3, then 2, then 3, etc.\n\nSo the losing positions can be represented as:\n\nFor k starting at 0,\n\nn = 0 + 2 +3 +2 +3 + ... up to k terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the losing positions as numbers of the form 5m + 0, 5m + 2, 5m + 5? Wait, no. Because 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nLooking at modulo 5:\n\n0 mod5=0\n\n2 mod5=2\n\n5 mod5=0\n\n7 mod5=2\n\n10 mod5=0\n\n12 mod5=2\n\n15 mod5=0\n\n17 mod5=2\n\n20 mod5=0\n\n22 mod5=2\n\nSo the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nn=0: 0 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=5: 0 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=7: 2 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=10:0 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=12:2 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=15:0 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=17:2 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nYes, so the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.\n\nWait, let's test n=1:1 mod5=1\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=3:3 mod5=3\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=4:4 mod5=4\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=6:6 mod5=1\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=8:8 mod5=3\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=9:9 mod5=4\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=11:11 mod5=1\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=13:13 mod5=3\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=14:14 mod5=4\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=16:16 mod5=1\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=18:18 mod5=3\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=19:19 mod5=4\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=21:21 mod5=1\u2192 W, correct.\n\nSo yes, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, if n is congruent to 0 or 2 mod5, then it's a losing position for the current player. Since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position, Bob can win.\n\nSo, the number of n \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the numbers \u22642024 that are \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5?\n\nThat's floor(2024/5) = 404, because 5*404=2020. 2024-2020=4, so 404 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5: the sequence is 2,7,12,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nThe first term a=2, common difference d=5.\n\nThe nth term is a + (n-1)*d \u22642024.\n\nSo, 2 + (n-1)*5 \u22642024 \u2192 (n-1)*5 \u22642022 \u2192 n-1 \u2264404.4 \u2192 n \u2264405.4. So n=405 terms.\n\nWait, let me compute it properly.\n\nThe number of terms \u22612 mod5 up to N is floor((N - a)/d) +1.\n\nSo for N=2024, a=2, d=5.\n\nNumber of terms = floor((2024 -2)/5) +1 = floor(2022/5) +1 = 404 +1=405.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22610 mod5: 2020 is the last term, which is 5*404=2020. So number of terms is 404.\n\nWait, but wait: 5*404=2020, which is \u22642024. So 404 terms.\n\nSo total losing positions n \u22610 or 2 mod5: 404 + 405=809.\n\nWait, 404 +405=809. So that would be 809 numbers \u22642024 where n is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm with the initial terms.\n\nLooking back, n=0 is a losing position, but n=0 isn't positive. So for positive integers n, we start from n=1.\n\nSo in the count, n=0 is excluded. So when I count numbers \u22610 mod5, starting from n=5,10,...2020. So the number is 404, as 2020=5*404.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5 start at 2,7,12,... up to \u22642024. Let's see the maximum term is 2024?\n\nWait, 2024 mod5 is 2024/5=404*5=2020, 2024-2020=4. So 2024 mod5=4. So the largest number \u22612 mod5 \u22642024 is 2022, since 2022=5*404 +2=2020+2=2022.\n\nSo the last term is 2022.\n\nSo the number of terms is (2022 -2)/5 +1 = (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo total numbers: 404 +405=809.\n\nBut wait, the question is about positive integers n \u22642024. So n=0 is not included. So for the 0 mod5 case, n starts at 5,10,...2020: 404 numbers.\n\nFor the 2 mod5 case, starts at 2,7,...2022: 405 numbers.\n\nSo 404 +405=809.\n\nSo the answer should be 809.\n\nWait, let me just confirm with smaller n.\n\nFor example, n=5: 5 is a losing position. So Bob can win. So in n=5, Alice can't win. So yes, 5 is counted.\n\nSimilarly, n=2: Bob can win.\n\nn=7: Bob can win.\n\nWait, let me test n=5: Alice has to move. She can take 1, leaving 4 (W for Bob). Or take 4, leaving 1 (W for Bob). So Bob can win regardless.\n\nYes, so n=5 is a losing position for Alice.\n\nSimilarly, n=2: Alice can only take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. So Alice loses.\n\nYes, so the counts are correct.\n\nSo, the total number is 809.\n",

Because 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nLooking at modulo 5:\n\n0 mod5=0\n\n2 mod5=2\n\n5 mod5=0\n\n7 mod5=2\n\n10 mod5=0\n\n12 mod5=2\n\n15 mod5=0\n\n17 mod5=2\n\n20 mod5=0\n\n22 mod5=2\n\nSo the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nn=0: 0 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=5: 0 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=7: 2 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=10:0 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=12:2 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nn=15:0 mod5=0 \u2192 L\n\nn=17:2 mod5=2 \u2192 L\n\nYes, so the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.\n\nWait, let's test n=1:1 mod5=1\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=3:3 mod5=3\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=4:4 mod5=4\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=6:6 mod5=1\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=8:8 mod5=3\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=9:9 mod5=4\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=11:11 mod5=1\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=13:13 mod5=3\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=14:14 mod5=4\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=16:16 mod5=1\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=18:18 mod5=3\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=19:19 mod5=4\u2192 W, correct.\n\nn=21:21 mod5=1\u2192 W, correct.\n\nSo yes, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, if n is congruent to 0 or 2 mod5, then it's a losing position for the current player. Since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position, Bob can win.\n\nSo, the number of n \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the numbers \u22642024 that are \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5?\n\nThat's floor(2024/5) = 404, because 5*404=2020. 2024-2020=4, so 404 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5: the sequence is 2,7,12,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nThe first term a=2, common difference d=5.\n\nThe nth term is a + (n-1)*d \u22642024.\n\nSo, 2 + (n-1)*5 \u22642024 \u2192 (n-1)*5 \u22642022 \u2192 n-1 \u2264404.4 \u2192 n \u2264405.4. So n=405 terms.\n\nWait, let me compute it properly.\n\nThe number of terms \u22612 mod5 up to N is floor((N - a)/d) +1.\n\nSo for N=2024, a=2, d=5.\n\nNumber of terms = floor((2024 -2)/5) +1 = floor(2022/5) +1 = 404 +1=405.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22610 mod5: 2020 is the last term, which is 5*404=2020. So number of terms is 404.\n\nWait, but wait: 5*404=2020, which is \u22642024. So 404 terms.\n\nSo total losing positions n \u22610 or 2 mod5: 404 + 405=809.\n\nWait, 404 +405=809. So that would be 809 numbers \u22642024 where n is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm with the initial terms.\n\nLooking back, n=0 is a losing position, but n=0 isn't positive. So for positive integers n, we start from n=1.\n\nSo in the count, n=0 is excluded. So when I count numbers \u22610 mod5, starting from n=5,10,...2020. So the number is 404, as 2020=5*404.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5 start at 2,7,12,... up to \u22642024. Let's see the maximum term is 2024?\n\nWait, 2024 mod5 is 2024/5=404*5=2020, 2024-2020=4. So 2024 mod5=4. So the largest number \u22612 mod5 \u22642024 is 2022, since 2022=5*404 +2=2020+2=2022.\n\nSo the last term is 2022.\n\nSo the number of terms is (2022 -2)/5 +1 = (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo total numbers: 404 +405=809.\n\nBut wait, the question is about positive integers n \u22642024. So n=0 is not included. So for the 0 mod5 case, n starts at 5,10,...2020: 404 numbers.\n\nFor the 2 mod5 case, starts at 2,7,...2022: 405 numbers.\n\nSo 404 +405=809.\n\nSo the answer should be 809.\n\nWait, let me just confirm with smaller n.\n\nFor example, n=5: 5 is a losing position. So Bob can win. So in n=5, Alice can't win. So yes, 5 is counted.\n\nSimilarly, n=2: Bob can win.\n\nn=7: Bob can win.\n\nWait, let me test n=5: Alice has to move. She can take 1, leaving 4 (W for Bob). Or take 4, leaving 1 (W for Bob). So Bob can win regardless.\n\nYes, so n=5 is a losing position for Alice.\n\nSimilarly, n=2: Alice can only take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. So Alice loses.\n\nYes, so the counts are correct.\n\nSo, the total number is 809.\n\n\nAlice and Bob play a game where they take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of \\( n \\) tokens. Alice goes first, and the player who removes the last token wins. To determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) where Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game using combinatorial game theory.\n\nA position is a losing position if the current player cannot force a win, assuming optimal play by the opponent. By examining the game, we find that the losing positions (where the current player cannot win) are the integers \\( n \\) congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5. This pattern emerges as follows:\n\n- \\( n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\): Losing positions.\n- \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\): Losing positions.\n\nFor \\( n \\leq 2024 \\), we count the numbers in these two congruence classes:\n\n1. **Numbers \\( \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\):** These are \\( 5, 10, 15, \\ldots, 2020 \\). The count is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2024}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 404 \\).\n\n2. **Numbers \\( \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\):** These are \\( 2, 7, 12, \\ldots, 2022 \\). The count is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2022}{5} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 405 \\).\n\nAdding these counts gives the total number of losing positions for Alice, where Bob can guarantee a win:\n\n\\[\n404 + 405 = 809\n\\]\n\nThus, there are **809** positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) where Bob can ensure victory.\n\n\\boxed{809}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out for how many positive integers n \u2264 2024, Bob can guarantee a win in this game where Alice and Bob take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. Since Alice goes first, Bob is the second player, so I need to find the values of n where Bob can force a win regardless of Alice's moves.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as winning or losing positions. A winning position means the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does, and a losing position is the opposite\u2014the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.\n\nSo, in this problem, I need to determine for each n whether it's a winning or losing position for the first player (Alice). If it's a losing position for Alice, that means Bob can force a win, so that n counts towards our total.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's denote that a position with k tokens is a losing position if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a position is a winning position if there exists at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent.\n\nSo, starting from the base case: if there are 0 tokens, the game is over, so the player who is supposed to move loses. Wait, but in this game, the last token taken wins. So, if there are 0 tokens, the previous player has already taken the last token and wins. So, maybe I should think of 0 as a losing position because the current player can't make a move.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The game starts with n tokens. The players take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. So, if a player is faced with 0 tokens, they can't make a move, which means the previous player has already taken the last token and thus wins. So, 0 tokens is a losing position for the player whose turn it is.\n\nTherefore, for k \u2265 1, the player can remove 1 or 4 tokens. So, for each k, the position is losing if both k-1 and k-4 (if \u22650) are winning positions. Because whatever the current player does, the opponent can win. Conversely, the position is winning if at least one of k-1 or k-4 is a losing position.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\n- A position is losing (P-position) if all moves lead to winning positions (N-positions) for the opponent.\n- A position is winning (N-position) if there exists at least one move leading to a losing position for the opponent.\n\nSo, starting from 0, which is a losing position. Let's build up the positions step by step.\n\nLet's make a table:\n\nk | Position (P or N)\n0 | P (losing)\n1 | ? Let's see. From 1, you can take 1 token, leading to 0, which is a P-position. So, since there's a move to a P-position, 1 is an N-position (winning).\n2 | From 2, you can take 1, leading to 1 (N) or take 4 (can't, since 2-4 is negative). So, all moves from 2 lead to N-positions. Wait, but wait, if you take 1 from 2, you get to 1, which is an N-position. So, since all moves from 2 lead to N-positions, does that mean 2 is a P-position? Because the next player can win from 1. Wait, no\u2014wait, if you're at 2, you take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent. The opponent is now at an N-position, which means they can win. So, you, as the current player, can force a win by leaving them at an N-position? No, wait. If you leave the opponent at an N-position, that means the opponent can win from there. So, if all your moves from 2 lead to N-positions, then you can't force a loss on the opponent. So, 2 is a P-position.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me think again. The current player is at k=2. They can take 1, leaving k=1, which is an N-position for the opponent. Since the opponent is at an N-position, they can win. So, as the current player, you can't force a win because any move you make allows the opponent to win. So, k=2 is a P-position.\n\nSimilarly, let's do k=3.\n\nk=3: You can take 1, leading to 2 (P), or take 4 (can't). So, taking 1 leads to a P-position, which is losing for the opponent. So, since you can move to a P-position, k=3 is an N-position.\n\nk=4: You can take 1, leading to 3 (N), or take 4, leading to 0 (P). So, you can take 4 and leave the opponent at 0, which is a P-position. So, k=4 is an N-position.\n\nk=5: Take 1, leads to 4 (N); take 4, leads to 1 (N). Both moves leave the opponent at N-positions. So, all moves from 5 lead to N-positions. So, k=5 is a P-position.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If from k=5, you take 1, opponent gets 4 (N). If you take 4, opponent gets 1 (N). So, the opponent is at N in both cases, meaning opponent can win. So, the current player can't force a win, so k=5 is a P-position.\n\nk=6: Take 1, leads to 5 (P). So, since you can move to a P-position, k=6 is N.\n\nk=7: Take 1, leads to 6 (N); take 4, leads to 3 (N). Both moves leave opponent at N. So, k=7 is P.\n\nk=8: Take 1, leads to 7 (P). So, you can move to P, so k=8 is N.\n\nk=9: Take 1 leads to 8 (N); take 4 leads to 5 (P). So, you can move to P by taking 4, so k=9 is N.\n\nk=10: Take 1 leads to 9 (N); take 4 leads to 6 (N). Both moves leave opponent at N. So, k=10 is P.\n\nWait, I'm noticing a pattern. Let me list the positions so far:\n\nk | P/N\n0 | P\n1 | N\n2 | P\n3 | N\n4 | N\n5 | P\n6 | N\n7 | P\n8 | N\n9 | N\n10| P\n\nHmm, it seems that every 5 steps, there's a P-position. Let me see: positions 0, 2, 5, 7, 10. The differences are 2, 3, 2, 3... Wait, 0 to 2 is +2, 2 to 5 is +3, 5 to 7 is +2, 7 to 10 is +3, 10 to 12 would be +2, etc. So, maybe the pattern alternates between adding 2 and 3?\n\nLet me test this. Let's compute a few more.\n\nk=11: Take 1 leads to 10 (P), so you can move to P. So, k=11 is N.\n\nk=12: Take 1 leads to 11 (N); take 4 leads to 8 (N). Both moves leave opponent at N. So, k=12 is P.\n\nk=13: Take 1 leads to 12 (P), so move there. So, k=13 is N.\n\nk=14: Take 1 leads to 13 (N); take 4 leads to 10 (P). So, you can take 4 and leave opponent at 10 (P). So, k=14 is N.\n\nk=15: Take 1 leads to 14 (N); take 4 leads to 11 (N). Both moves lead to N. So, k=15 is P.\n\nSo, now the P positions are 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... It's every 5, but the exact positions are 0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nWait, let's see: from 0 to 2 is +2, 2 to 5 is +3, 5 to7 +2, 7 to10 +3, 10 to12 +2, 12 to15 +3, 15 to17 +2, 17 to20 +3. So, yes, the pattern alternates between adding 2 and 3.\n\nSo, the P-positions are numbers congruent to 0, 2 mod 5? Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking at the P-positions: 0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\n0 mod5 is 0, 2 mod5 is 2, 5 mod5 is 0, 7 mod5 is 2, 10 mod5 is 0, 12 mod5 is 2, 15 mod5 is 0, 17 mod5 is 2, 20 mod5 is 0. So, yes, it seems that the P-positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo5.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\n0 mod5=0 \u2192 P\n2 mod5=2 \u2192 P\n5 mod5=0 \u2192 P\n7 mod5=2 \u2192 P\n10 mod5=0 \u2192 P\n12 mod5=2 \u2192 P\n15 mod5=0 \u2192 P\n17 mod5=2 \u2192 P\n20 mod5=0 \u2192 P\n\nSo, yes, all P-positions are numbers where n mod5 is 0 or 2. So, if n \u22610 or 2 mod5, it's a losing position for the current player.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with the earlier positions.\n\nk=3: 3 mod5=3 \u2192 N\nk=4:4 mod5=4 \u2192N\nk=5:5 mod5=0 \u2192P\nk=6:6 mod5=1 \u2192N\nk=7:7 mod5=2 \u2192P\nk=8:8 mod5=3 \u2192N\nk=9:9 mod5=4 \u2192N\nk=10:10 mod5=0 \u2192P\nYes, this seems consistent.\n\nSo, if the starting number n is a P-position (n\u22610 or 2 mod5), then the current player (Alice) is in a losing position if both players play optimally. Therefore, Bob can force a win.\n\nSo, the question is to find the number of positive integers n \u22642024 such that n is a P-position, i.e., n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, how many numbers \u22642024 are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo5.\n\nLet me compute the count.\n\nFirst, for numbers \u22610 mod5: the numbers are 5,10,15,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nSimilarly, for \u22612 mod5: numbers are 2,7,12,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nSo, let's find how many terms are in each sequence.\n\nFor \u22610 mod5:\n\nThe sequence starts at 5, ends at the largest multiple of5 \u22642024.\n\nWhat's the largest multiple of5 \u22642024?\n\n2024 divided by5 is 404.8, so the largest multiple is 404*5=2020.\n\nSo, the numbers are 5,10,...,2020. Number of terms is 2020/5=404.\n\nWait, but wait, 5*1=5, 5*2=10, ...,5*404=2020. So, the number of terms is 404.\n\nBut wait, n must be positive integers. So, including 5,10,...,2020.\n\nSo, 404 terms.\n\nFor \u22612 mod5:\n\nNumbers are 2,7,12,..., up to \u22642024.\n\nWhat's the largest number \u22612 mod5 \u22642024?\n\n2024 divided by5 is 404.8, so 404*5=2020. 2020+2=2022 is \u22642024.\n\nSo, the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nHow many terms? The first term is 2=5*0 +2, the next is 5*1 +2, ..., up to 5*(k) +2 \u22642024.\n\nSo, 5k +2 \u22642024 \u21925k \u22642022 \u2192k \u2264404.4. So, k=0 to 404, which is 405 terms.\n\nWait, because k=0 gives 2, k=1 gives7,...,k=404 gives5*404 +2=2020+2=2022.\n\nSo, the number of terms is 405.\n\nTherefore, total number of P-positions is 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5)= 809.\n\nWait, but hold on, n has to be positive. So, for the 0 mod5 case, the first term is 5, which is n=5. But n=0 is not a positive integer, so we don't include it. So, in the 0 mod5 case, we have 404 terms starting from 5 up to 2020.\n\nIn the 2 mod5 case, the first term is 2, which is positive. So, the terms are 2,7,...,2022, which is 405 terms.\n\nSo, total is 404 +405=809.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the counts.\n\nFor 0 mod5: numbers from5 to2020 inclusive, step5.\n\nNumber of terms: ((2020 -5)/5 ) +1 = (2015/5)+1=403+1=404. Correct.\n\nFor 2 mod5: numbers from2 to2022 inclusive, step5.\n\nNumber of terms: ((2022 -2)/5 ) +1= (2020/5)+1=404+1=405. Correct.\n\nSo, total is 404+405=809.\n\nBut wait, is 2022 the last term? 2022=5*404 +2=2020+2=2022, yes.\n\nAnd 2024 is not included because 2024 mod5 is 2024-5*404=2024-2020=4, so 2024 mod5=4, which is not 0 or2. So, yes, the last term is2022.\n\nTherefore, the total number of positive integers n \u22642024 where Bob can guarantee a win is809.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when n is a P-position, the current player (Alice) is in a losing position, so Bob can win. So, yes, the count is correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check a small n and see.\n\nFor example, n=2: Alice can take1, leaving1, which is N-position (Bob can take1 and win). Wait, no, wait. Wait, if n=2, Alice's options: take1, leaves1 for Bob. Bob is at1, which is N-position, so Bob can take1 and win. Alternatively, Alice could take4, but she can't because n=2. So, Alice must take1, leaving1 for Bob. Bob takes1 and wins. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. So, yes, n=2 counts.\n\nn=5: Alice can take1, leaving4, which is N-position (Bob can take4 and win). Or Alice can take4, leaving1, which is N-position (Bob takes1 and wins). So, no matter what Alice does, Bob can win. So, n=5 is a P-position.\n\nn=7: Alice can take1, leaving6 (N), so Bob can take1 and leave5 (P). Wait, wait. Let me see:\n\nn=7: Alice's options:\n\nTake1: leaves6. Bob is at6, which is N-position. Bob can take1, leaving5 (P). Then Alice is at5, which is P, so she can't force a win. Wait, but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, Alice could take4, leaving3 (N). Then Bob can take1, leaving2 (P). Then Alice is at2, which is P, so she can't win. So, regardless of Alice's move, Bob can force Alice into a P-position, so n=7 is a P-position.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier analysis, n=7 is a P-position, which is correct because 7 mod5=2.\n\nSo, the pattern seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, the total number of n \u22642024 where Bob can force a win is809.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out for how many positive integers n \u2264 2024, Bob can guarantee a win in this game where Alice and Bob take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. Since Alice goes first, Bob is the second player, so I need to find the values of n where Bob can force a win regardless of Alice's moves.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as winning or losing positions. A winning position means the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does, and a losing position is the opposite\u2014the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.\n\nSo, in this problem, I need to determine for each n whether it's a winning or losing position for the first player (Alice). If it's a losing position for Alice, that means Bob can force a win, so that n counts towards our total.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's denote that a position with k tokens is a losing position if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a position is a winning position if there exists at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent.\n\nSo, starting from the base case: if there are 0 tokens, the game is over, so the player who is supposed to move loses. Wait, but in this game, the last token taken wins. So, if there are 0 tokens, the previous player has already taken the last token and wins. So, maybe I should think of 0 as a losing position because the current player can't make a move.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The game starts with n tokens. The players take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. So, if a player is faced with 0 tokens, they can't make a move, which means the previous player has already taken the last token and thus wins. So, 0 tokens is a losing position for the player whose turn it is.\n\nTherefore, for k \u2265 1, the player can remove 1 or 4 tokens. So, for each k, the position is losing if both k-1 and k-4 (if \u22650) are winning positions. Because whatever the current player does, the opponent can win. Conversely, the position is winning if at least one of k-1 or k-4 is a losing position.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\n- A position is losing (P-position) if all moves lead to winning positions (N-positions) for the opponent.\n- A position is winning (N-position) if there exists at least one move leading to a losing position for the opponent.\n\nSo, starting from 0, which is a losing position. Let's build up the positions step by step.\n\nLet's make a table:\n\nk | Position (P or N)\n0 | P (losing)\n1 | ? Let's see. From 1, you can take 1 token, leading to 0, which is a P-position. So, since there's a move to a P-position, 1 is an N-position (winning).\n2 | From 2, you can take 1, leading to 1 (N) or take 4 (can't, since 2-4 is negative). So, all moves from 2 lead to N-positions. Wait, but wait, if you take 1 from 2, you get to 1, which is an N-position. So, since all moves from 2 lead to N-positions, does that mean 2 is a P-position? Because the next player can win from 1. Wait, no\u2014wait, if you're at 2, you take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent. The opponent is now at an N-position, which means they can win. So, you, as the current player, can force a win by leaving them at an N-position? No, wait. If you leave the opponent at an N-position, that means the opponent can win from there. So, if all your moves from 2 lead to N-positions, then you can't force a loss on the opponent. So, 2 is a P-position.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me think again. The current player is at k=2. They can take 1, leaving k=1, which is an N-position for the opponent. Since the opponent is at an N-position, they can win. So, as the current player, you can't force a win because any move you make allows the opponent to win. So, k=2 is a P-position.\n\nSimilarly, let's do k=3.\n\nk=3: You can take 1, leading to 2 (P), or take 4 (can't). So, taking 1 leads to a P-position, which is losing for the opponent. So, since you can move to a P-position, k=3 is an N-position.\n\nk=4: You can take 1, leading to 3 (N), or take 4, leading to 0 (P). So, you can take 4 and leave the opponent at 0, which is a P-position. So, k=4 is an N-position.\n\nk=5: Take 1, leads to 4 (N); take 4, leads to 1 (N). Both moves leave the opponent at N-positions. So, all moves from 5 lead to N-positions. So, k=5 is a P-position.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If from k=5, you take 1, opponent gets 4 (N). If you take 4, opponent gets 1 (N). So, the opponent is at N in both cases, meaning opponent can win. So, the current player can't force a win, so k=5 is a P-position.\n\nk=6: Take 1, leads to 5 (P). So, since you can move to a P-position, k=6 is N.\n\nk=7: Take 1, leads to 6 (N); take 4, leads to 3 (N). Both moves leave opponent at N. So, k=7 is P.\n\nk=8: Take 1, leads to 7 (P). So, you can move to P, so k=8 is N.\n\nk=9: Take 1 leads to 8 (N); take 4 leads to 5 (P). So, you can move to P by taking 4, so k=9 is N.\n\nk=10: Take 1 leads to 9 (N); take 4 leads to 6 (N). Both moves leave opponent at N. So, k=10 is P.\n\nWait, I'm noticing a pattern. Let me list the positions so far:\n\nk | P/N\n0 | P\n1 | N\n2 | P\n3 | N\n4 | N\n5 | P\n6 | N\n7 | P\n8 | N\n9 | N\n10| P\n\nHmm, it seems that every 5 steps, there's a P-position. Let me see: positions 0, 2, 5, 7, 10. The differences are 2, 3, 2, 3... Wait, 0 to 2 is +2, 2 to 5 is +3, 5 to 7 is +2, 7 to 10 is +3, 10 to 12 would be +2, etc. So, maybe the pattern alternates between adding 2 and 3?\n\nLet me test this. Let's compute a few more.\n\nk=11: Take 1 leads to 10 (P), so you can move to P. So, k=11 is N.\n\nk=12: Take 1 leads to 11 (N); take 4 leads to 8 (N). Both moves leave opponent at N. So, k=12 is P.\n\nk=13: Take 1 leads to 12 (P), so move there. So, k=13 is N.\n\nk=14: Take 1 leads to 13 (N); take 4 leads to 10 (P). So, you can take 4 and leave opponent at 10 (P). So, k=14 is N.\n\nk=15: Take 1 leads to 14 (N); take 4 leads to 11 (N). Both moves lead to N. So, k=15 is P.\n\nSo, now the P positions are 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... It's every 5, but the exact positions are 0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nWait, let's see: from 0 to 2 is +2, 2 to 5 is +3, 5 to7 +2, 7 to10 +3, 10 to12 +2, 12 to15 +3, 15 to17 +2, 17 to20 +3. So, yes, the pattern alternates between adding 2 and 3.\n\nSo, the P-positions are numbers congruent to 0, 2 mod 5? Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking at the P-positions: 0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\n0 mod5 is 0, 2 mod5 is 2, 5 mod5 is 0, 7 mod5 is 2, 10 mod5 is 0, 12 mod5 is 2, 15 mod5 is 0, 17 mod5 is 2, 20 mod5 is 0. So, yes, it seems that the P-positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo5.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\n0 mod5=0 \u2192 P\n2 mod5=2 \u2192 P\n5 mod5=0 \u2192 P\n7 mod5=2 \u2192 P\n10 mod5=0 \u2192 P\n12 mod5=2 \u2192 P\n15 mod5=0 \u2192 P\n17 mod5=2 \u2192 P\n20 mod5=0 \u2192 P\n\nSo, yes, all P-positions are numbers where n mod5 is 0 or 2. So, if n \u22610 or 2 mod5, it's a losing position for the current player.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with the earlier positions.\n\nk=3: 3 mod5=3 \u2192 N\nk=4:4 mod5=4 \u2192N\nk=5:5 mod5=0 \u2192P\nk=6:6 mod5=1 \u2192N\nk=7:7 mod5=2 \u2192P\nk=8:8 mod5=3 \u2192N\nk=9:9 mod5=4 \u2192N\nk=10:10 mod5=0 \u2192P\nYes, this seems consistent.\n\nSo, if the starting number n is a P-position (n\u22610 or 2 mod5), then the current player (Alice) is in a losing position if both players play optimally. Therefore, Bob can force a win.\n\nSo, the question is to find the number of positive integers n \u22642024 such that n is a P-position, i.e., n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, how many numbers \u22642024 are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo5.\n\nLet me compute the count.\n\nFirst, for numbers \u22610 mod5: the numbers are 5,10,15,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nSimilarly, for \u22612 mod5: numbers are 2,7,12,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nSo, let's find how many terms are in each sequence.\n\nFor \u22610 mod5:\n\nThe sequence starts at 5, ends at the largest multiple of5 \u22642024.\n\nWhat's the largest multiple of5 \u22642024?\n\n2024 divided by5 is 404.8, so the largest multiple is 404*5=2020.\n\nSo, the numbers are 5,10,...,2020. Number of terms is 2020/5=404.\n\nWait, but wait, 5*1=5, 5*2=10, ...,5*404=2020. So, the number of terms is 404.\n\nBut wait, n must be positive integers. So, including 5,10,...,2020.\n\nSo, 404 terms.\n\nFor \u22612 mod5:\n\nNumbers are 2,7,12,..., up to \u22642024.\n\nWhat's the largest number \u22612 mod5 \u22642024?\n\n2024 divided by5 is 404.8, so 404*5=2020. 2020+2=2022 is \u22642024.\n\nSo, the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nHow many terms? The first term is 2=5*0 +2, the next is 5*1 +2, ..., up to 5*(k) +2 \u22642024.\n\nSo, 5k +2 \u22642024 \u21925k \u22642022 \u2192k \u2264404.4. So, k=0 to 404, which is 405 terms.\n\nWait, because k=0 gives 2, k=1 gives7,...,k=404 gives5*404 +2=2020+2=2022.\n\nSo, the number of terms is 405.\n\nTherefore, total number of P-positions is 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5)= 809.\n\nWait, but hold on, n has to be positive. So, for the 0 mod5 case, the first term is 5, which is n=5. But n=0 is not a positive integer, so we don't include it. So, in the 0 mod5 case, we have 404 terms starting from 5 up to 2020.\n\nIn the 2 mod5 case, the first term is 2, which is positive. So, the terms are 2,7,...,2022, which is 405 terms.\n\nSo, total is 404 +405=809.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the counts.\n\nFor 0 mod5: numbers from5 to2020 inclusive, step5.\n\nNumber of terms: ((2020 -5)/5 ) +1 = (2015/5)+1=403+1=404. Correct.\n\nFor 2 mod5: numbers from2 to2022 inclusive, step5.\n\nNumber of terms: ((2022 -2)/5 ) +1= (2020/5)+1=404+1=405. Correct.\n\nSo, total is 404+405=809.\n\nBut wait, is 2022 the last term? 2022=5*404 +2=2020+2=2022, yes.\n\nAnd 2024 is not included because 2024 mod5 is 2024-5*404=2024-2020=4, so 2024 mod5=4, which is not 0 or2. So, yes, the last term is2022.\n\nTherefore, the total number of positive integers n \u22642024 where Bob can guarantee a win is809.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when n is a P-position, the current player (Alice) is in a losing position, so Bob can win. So, yes, the count is correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check a small n and see.\n\nFor example, n=2: Alice can take1, leaving1, which is N-position (Bob can take1 and win). Wait, no, wait. Wait, if n=2, Alice's options: take1, leaves1 for Bob. Bob is at1, which is N-position, so Bob can take1 and win. Alternatively, Alice could take4, but she can't because n=2. So, Alice must take1, leaving1 for Bob. Bob takes1 and wins. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. So, yes, n=2 counts.\n\nn=5: Alice can take1, leaving4, which is N-position (Bob can take4 and win). Or Alice can take4, leaving1, which is N-position (Bob takes1 and wins). So, no matter what Alice does, Bob can win. So, n=5 is a P-position.\n\nn=7: Alice can take1, leaving6 (N), so Bob can take1 and leave5 (P). Wait, wait. Let me see:\n\nn=7: Alice's options:\n\nTake1: leaves6. Bob is at6, which is N-position. Bob can take1, leaving5 (P). Then Alice is at5, which is P, so she can't force a win. Wait, but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, Alice could take4, leaving3 (N). Then Bob can take1, leaving2 (P). Then Alice is at2, which is P, so she can't win. So, regardless of Alice's move, Bob can force Alice into a P-position, so n=7 is a P-position.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier analysis, n=7 is a P-position, which is correct because 7 mod5=2.\n\nSo, the pattern seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, the total number of n \u22642024 where Bob can force a win is809.\n\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game using combinatorial game theory. The game involves two players taking turns removing 1 or 4 tokens from a stack, with the player taking the last token winning. Alice goes first, so we need to identify the values of \\( n \\) where Alice is in a losing position (P-position), allowing Bob to force a win.\n\n### Key Steps:\n\n1. **Game Analysis**:\n   - A position is a **P-position** (losing) if every move leads to an **N-position** (winning) for the opponent.\n   - A position is an **N-position** (winning) if there exists at least one move leading to a **P-position** for the opponent.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - By evaluating small values of \\( n \\), we observe that the losing positions (P-positions) occur at \\( n \\equiv 0 \\) or \\( 2 \\pmod{5} \\).\n\n3. **Counting P-positions**:\n   - For \\( n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\): The sequence is \\( 5, 10, 15, \\ldots, 2020 \\). There are \\( 404 \\) such numbers.\n   - For \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\): The sequence is \\( 2, 7, 12, \\ldots, 2022 \\). There are \\( 405 \\) such numbers.\n\n4. **Total Count**:\n   - Adding the counts from both sequences gives \\( 404 + 405 = 809 \\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) where Bob can guarantee a win is **809**.\n\n\\boxed{809}",

The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. It seems like a combinatorial game theory problem, so maybe I can model it using something like the concept of winning and losing positions.\n\nA winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. Conversely, a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, let's try to model this. Let's denote positions as either winning (W) or losing (L) for the player about to move.\n\nWe can start by looking at small values of n and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn = 1: The current player takes 1 token and wins. So, W.\n\nn = 2: The current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Or take 4, but that's not possible. So, the current player can only take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is a winning position for them. So, the current player can't force a win, so n=2 is L.\n\nWait, no, wait. If n=2, the current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. So, the current player at n=2 can't force a win. So, n=2 is L.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the current player can take 1, leaving n=1, which is a W position for the opponent. So, the current player at n=2 can't force a win, so n=2 is a losing position, meaning the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally. So, L.\n\nn=3: Current player can take 1, leaving n=2 (L for opponent), so opponent is in a losing position. So, n=3 is W.\n\nn=4: Current player can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So, W.\n\nn=5: Current player can take 1, leaving 4 (W for opponent), or take 4, leaving 1 (W for opponent). So, no matter what the current player does, the opponent can win. So, n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: Current player can take 1, leaving 5 (L for opponent). So, n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: Current player can take 1, leaving 6 (W for opponent). Or take 4, leaving 3 (W for opponent). So, opponent can win either way. So, n=7 is L.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, if current player takes 1 from 7, leaving 6, which is W for opponent. If current player takes 4, leaving 3, which is W for opponent. So, opponent can win either way, so n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: Current player can take 1, leaving 7 (L for opponent). So, n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: Current player can take 1, leaving 8 (W for opponent), or take 4, leaving 5 (L for opponent). Wait, so if current player takes 4 from 9, leaving 5, which is L for opponent, meaning opponent can't win. So, current player can force a win by taking 4. So, n=9 is W.\n\nWait, but I thought n=5 is L. So, if current player can take 4 from 9 to leave 5 (L), then current player can win. So, n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: Let's see. Current player can take 1, leaving 9 (W for opponent), or take 4, leaving 6 (W for opponent). So, opponent can win either way. So, n=10 is L.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, n=10: If current player takes 1, opponent gets 9, which is W. Opponent can win. If current player takes 4, opponent gets 6, which is W. So, opponent can win in both cases. So, n=10 is L.\n\nWait, but let me check n=6 again. n=6 is W because the current player can take 1, leaving 5, which is L. So, opponent can't win from 5. So, n=6 is W.\n\nWait, maybe I should make a table for n=1 to n=10 to see the pattern.\n\nLet me list n from 1 to 10:\n\nn | Position (W/L)\n1 | W (can take 1)\n2 | L (only can take 1, leaving 1 for opponent who wins)\n3 | W (take 1, leaving 2 (L))\n4 | W (take 4 and win)\n5 | L (taking 1 leaves 4 (W), taking 4 leaves 1 (W))\n6 | W (take 1, leaving 5 (L))\n7 | L (taking 1 leaves 6 (W), taking 4 leaves 3 (W))\n8 | W (take 1, leaving 7 (L))\n9 | W (take 4, leaving 5 (L))\n10| L (taking 1 leaves 9 (W), taking 4 leaves 6 (W))\n\nHmm, so the positions are:\n\nn : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nPos: W L W W L W L W W L\n\nWait, let me check n=5 again. n=5 is L because any move leads to opponent's win.\n\nn=6: take 1 to leave 5 (L), so current player can force a win. So, W.\n\nn=7: taking 1 leaves 6 (W), taking 4 leaves 3 (W). So, opponent can win in both cases, so n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: take 1 to leave 7 (L), so current player can win. So, W.\n\nn=9: take 4 to leave 5 (L), so current player can win. So, W.\n\nn=10: take 1 leaves 9 (W), take 4 leaves 6 (W). So, opponent can win either way, so L.\n\nHmm, so the pattern seems to be that every 5th position is L, but let's check.\n\nWait, n=1: W\n\nn=2: L\n\nn=3: W\n\nn=4: W\n\nn=5: L\n\nn=6: W\n\nn=7: L\n\nn=8: W\n\nn=9: W\n\nn=10: L\n\nWait, so the losing positions are n=2,5,7,10,... Hmm, that's not every 5. Let me see the differences between losing positions.\n\nFrom 2 to 5 is 3, 5 to 7 is 2, 7 to 10 is 3, 10 to ... Let's see n=11: Let me compute n=11.\n\nn=11: current player can take 1, leaving 10 (L), so opponent is in a losing position. So, n=11 is W.\n\nn=12: take 1, leaving 11 (W), or take 4, leaving 8 (W). So, opponent can win either way. So, n=12 is L.\n\nWait, so n=12 is L. So, the losing positions are 2,5,7,10,12,...\n\nHmm, let me compute a few more.\n\nn=13: current player can take 1, leaving 12 (L), so n=13 is W.\n\nn=14: take 1 leaves 13 (W), take 4 leaves 10 (L). So, current player can take 4, leaving 10 (L), forcing opponent to lose. So, n=14 is W.\n\nn=15: current player can take 1, leaving 14 (W), or take 4, leaving 11 (W). So, opponent can win either way, so n=15 is L.\n\nWait, so n=15 is L.\n\nSo, losing positions so far: 2,5,7,10,12,15,...\n\nHmm, trying to find a pattern here. Let me list the losing positions:\n\nn: 2,5,7,10,12,15,...\n\nLooking at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n5-2=3\n\n7-5=2\n\n10-7=3\n\n12-10=2\n\n15-12=3\n\nSo, the pattern seems to be alternating between adding 3 and adding 2.\n\nSo, starting from 2, add 3 to get 5, then add 2 to get 7, add 3 to get 10, add 2 to get 12, add 3 to get 15, and so on.\n\nSo, the losing positions are 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,30, etc.\n\nSo, the losing positions are numbers that are either 2 mod 5 or 0 mod 5? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, 2 mod 5 is 2,5,8,11,14, etc. But our losing positions are 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a cycle of 5. Let me see.\n\nWait, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,...\n\nLooking at this sequence, perhaps the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 and 0 mod 5?\n\nWait, 2 mod5 is 2,7,12,17,22,27,...\n\nAnd 0 mod5 is 5,10,15,20,25,30,...\n\nWait, but 5 is 0 mod5, 10 is 0 mod5, etc. So, perhaps the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nn=2: 2 mod5=2 \u2192 yes, losing.\n\nn=5: 0 mod5 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=7: 7 mod5=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=10: 0 mod5 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=12: 12 mod5=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=15: 0 mod5 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=17: 17 mod5=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=20: 0 mod5 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=22: 22 mod5=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo, this seems to fit. So, the losing positions are numbers where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, if n is congruent to 0 or 2 modulo5, then it's a losing position for the current player.\n\nBut wait, let's confirm with n=14.\n\nn=14: 14 mod5=4. So, according to this, it's not a losing position, and indeed, earlier calculation showed that n=14 is a winning position, which aligns.\n\nSimilarly, n=13: 13 mod5=3 \u2192 W.\n\nn=16: 16 mod5=1 \u2192 W.\n\nSo, this seems to hold.\n\nSo, the losing positions are n where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's check n=7: 7 mod5=2 \u2192 yes, it's a losing position.\n\nn=10: 10 mod5=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=15:15 mod5=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=17:17 mod5=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=20:20 mod5=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo, this seems consistent.\n\nSo, if Bob is to have a winning strategy, he must be able to force the game into a losing position for Alice on her turn. That is, when Bob can make a move that leaves the stack in a losing position for Alice.\n\nWait, but wait, the question is asking for the number of n \u22642024 where Bob can force a win regardless of Alice's play. That is, for these n, Bob can win.\n\nWait, but in the initial analysis, the losing positions are when the current player cannot force a win. So, if the starting position is a losing position, then the first player (Alice) cannot force a win, which would mean Bob can win.\n\nWait, so if n is a losing position, then Alice cannot force a win, so Bob can. So, the number of n \u22642024 where n is a losing position (i.e., n \u22610 or 2 mod5) would be the answer.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the numbers \u22642024 that are \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo, let me compute how many numbers \u22642024 are congruent to 0 mod5 and 2 mod5.\n\nFirst, find how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5:\n\nThe largest number \u22642024 divisible by5 is 2020 (since 2020 =5\u00d7404).\n\nSo, the count is 404.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5: the smallest is 2, then 7,12,... up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nWhat's the largest number \u22642024 that is \u22612 mod5?\n\n2024 divided by5: 2024=5\u00d7404 + 4, so 5\u00d7404=2020. 2020+2=2022 \u22642024, so 2022 is the largest \u22612 mod5.\n\nSo, the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with a=2, d=5.\n\nThe number of terms is given by n where 2 + (k-1)*5 \u22642024.\n\nSo, solving 5(k-1) \u22642022 \u2192 k-1 \u22642022/5=404.4 \u2192 k-1=404 \u2192 k=405.\n\nSo, there are 405 numbers \u22612 mod5 \u22642024.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The number of terms in 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nThe nth term is a_n =2 + (n-1)*5 \u22642024.\n\nSo, 2 +5(n-1) \u22642024 \u21925(n-1) \u22642022 \u2192n-1 \u2264404.4 \u2192n-1=404 \u2192n=405.\n\nYes, 405 terms.\n\nSo, the total number of losing positions is 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5) =809.\n\nWait, 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check: 404 numbers \u22610 mod5, and 405 numbers \u22612 mod5. So total is 809.\n\nBut let me verify: from 1 to2024, how many numbers are \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nEach block of 5 numbers has exactly two such numbers: 0 and 2 mod5.\n\nSo, 2024 \u00f75=404.8.\n\nSo, 404 complete blocks, each contributing 2 numbers, so 404\u00d72=808.\n\nThen, in the remaining 4 numbers (2021,2022,2023,2024):\n\nCheck which are \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\n2021 mod5: 2021 \u00f75=404\u00d75=2020, so 2021=2020+1\u21921 mod5.\n\n2022: 2020+2\u21922 mod5 \u2192 yes.\n\n2023:3 mod5.\n\n2024:4 mod5.\n\nSo, only 2022 is \u22612 mod5 in the last partial block.\n\nSo, total numbers \u22610 or 2 mod5 are 404\u00d72 +1=808 +1=809.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, the number of n \u22642024 where n is a losing position is 809.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm again. The problem states that Bob has a winning strategy, which occurs when the starting position is a losing position for Alice, meaning that n is a losing position. So, the number of such n is 809.\n\nWait, but let me think again: in the initial analysis, the losing positions are when the current player cannot force a win. So, if the game starts at a losing position, then the first player (Alice) cannot force a win, so Bob can.\n\nThus, the answer is 809.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the small n's, the losing positions were 2,5,7,10,12,15, etc., which fit into 0 and 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the total is 809.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the count.\n\nWait, for 0 mod5 up to 2020: 2020/5=404 numbers.\n\nFor 2 mod5: starting at 2, the numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nThe number of terms is ((2022-2)/5)+1= (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.\n\nSo, 404+405=809.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 809.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each time. Alice goes first. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. It seems like a combinatorial game theory problem, so maybe I can model it using something like the concept of winning and losing positions.\n\nA winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. Conversely, a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, let's try to model this. Let's denote positions as either winning (W) or losing (L) for the player about to move.\n\nWe can start by looking at small values of n and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn = 1: The current player takes 1 token and wins. So, W.\n\nn = 2: The current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Or take 4, but that's not possible. So, the current player can only take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is a winning position for them. So, the current player can't force a win, so n=2 is L.\n\nWait, no, wait. If n=2, the current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. So, the current player at n=2 can't force a win. So, n=2 is L.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the current player can take 1, leaving n=1, which is a W position for the opponent. So, the current player at n=2 can't force a win, so n=2 is a losing position, meaning the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally. So, L.\n\nn=3: Current player can take 1, leaving n=2 (L for opponent), so opponent is in a losing position. So, n=3 is W.\n\nn=4: Current player can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So, W.\n\nn=5: Current player can take 1, leaving 4 (W for opponent), or take 4, leaving 1 (W for opponent). So, no matter what the current player does, the opponent can win. So, n=5 is L.\n\nn=6: Current player can take 1, leaving 5 (L for opponent). So, n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: Current player can take 1, leaving 6 (W for opponent). Or take 4, leaving 3 (W for opponent). So, opponent can win either way. So, n=7 is L.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, if current player takes 1 from 7, leaving 6, which is W for opponent. If current player takes 4, leaving 3, which is W for opponent. So, opponent can win either way, so n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: Current player can take 1, leaving 7 (L for opponent). So, n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: Current player can take 1, leaving 8 (W for opponent), or take 4, leaving 5 (L for opponent). Wait, so if current player takes 4 from 9, leaving 5, which is L for opponent, meaning opponent can't win. So, current player can force a win by taking 4. So, n=9 is W.\n\nWait, but I thought n=5 is L. So, if current player can take 4 from 9 to leave 5 (L), then current player can win. So, n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: Let's see. Current player can take 1, leaving 9 (W for opponent), or take 4, leaving 6 (W for opponent). So, opponent can win either way. So, n=10 is L.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, n=10: If current player takes 1, opponent gets 9, which is W. Opponent can win. If current player takes 4, opponent gets 6, which is W. So, opponent can win in both cases. So, n=10 is L.\n\nWait, but let me check n=6 again. n=6 is W because the current player can take 1, leaving 5, which is L. So, opponent can't win from 5. So, n=6 is W.\n\nWait, maybe I should make a table for n=1 to n=10 to see the pattern.\n\nLet me list n from 1 to 10:\n\nn | Position (W/L)\n1 | W (can take 1)\n2 | L (only can take 1, leaving 1 for opponent who wins)\n3 | W (take 1, leaving 2 (L))\n4 | W (take 4 and win)\n5 | L (taking 1 leaves 4 (W), taking 4 leaves 1 (W))\n6 | W (take 1, leaving 5 (L))\n7 | L (taking 1 leaves 6 (W), taking 4 leaves 3 (W))\n8 | W (take 1, leaving 7 (L))\n9 | W (take 4, leaving 5 (L))\n10| L (taking 1 leaves 9 (W), taking 4 leaves 6 (W))\n\nHmm, so the positions are:\n\nn : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nPos: W L W W L W L W W L\n\nWait, let me check n=5 again. n=5 is L because any move leads to opponent's win.\n\nn=6: take 1 to leave 5 (L), so current player can force a win. So, W.\n\nn=7: taking 1 leaves 6 (W), taking 4 leaves 3 (W). So, opponent can win in both cases, so n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: take 1 to leave 7 (L), so current player can win. So, W.\n\nn=9: take 4 to leave 5 (L), so current player can win. So, W.\n\nn=10: take 1 leaves 9 (W), take 4 leaves 6 (W). So, opponent can win either way, so L.\n\nHmm, so the pattern seems to be that every 5th position is L, but let's check.\n\nWait, n=1: W\n\nn=2: L\n\nn=3: W\n\nn=4: W\n\nn=5: L\n\nn=6: W\n\nn=7: L\n\nn=8: W\n\nn=9: W\n\nn=10: L\n\nWait, so the losing positions are n=2,5,7,10,... Hmm, that's not every 5. Let me see the differences between losing positions.\n\nFrom 2 to 5 is 3, 5 to 7 is 2, 7 to 10 is 3, 10 to ... Let's see n=11: Let me compute n=11.\n\nn=11: current player can take 1, leaving 10 (L), so opponent is in a losing position. So, n=11 is W.\n\nn=12: take 1, leaving 11 (W), or take 4, leaving 8 (W). So, opponent can win either way. So, n=12 is L.\n\nWait, so n=12 is L. So, the losing positions are 2,5,7,10,12,...\n\nHmm, let me compute a few more.\n\nn=13: current player can take 1, leaving 12 (L), so n=13 is W.\n\nn=14: take 1 leaves 13 (W), take 4 leaves 10 (L). So, current player can take 4, leaving 10 (L), forcing opponent to lose. So, n=14 is W.\n\nn=15: current player can take 1, leaving 14 (W), or take 4, leaving 11 (W). So, opponent can win either way, so n=15 is L.\n\nWait, so n=15 is L.\n\nSo, losing positions so far: 2,5,7,10,12,15,...\n\nHmm, trying to find a pattern here. Let me list the losing positions:\n\nn: 2,5,7,10,12,15,...\n\nLooking at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n5-2=3\n\n7-5=2\n\n10-7=3\n\n12-10=2\n\n15-12=3\n\nSo, the pattern seems to be alternating between adding 3 and adding 2.\n\nSo, starting from 2, add 3 to get 5, then add 2 to get 7, add 3 to get 10, add 2 to get 12, add 3 to get 15, and so on.\n\nSo, the losing positions are 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,30, etc.\n\nSo, the losing positions are numbers that are either 2 mod 5 or 0 mod 5?

So, according to this, it's not a losing position, and indeed, earlier calculation showed that n=14 is a winning position, which aligns.\n\nSimilarly, n=13: 13 mod5=3 \u2192 W.\n\nn=16: 16 mod5=1 \u2192 W.\n\nSo, this seems to hold.\n\nSo, the losing positions are n where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's check n=7: 7 mod5=2 \u2192 yes, it's a losing position.\n\nn=10: 10 mod5=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=12:12 mod5=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=15:15 mod5=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=17:17 mod5=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nn=20:20 mod5=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo, this seems consistent.\n\nSo, if Bob is to have a winning strategy, he must be able to force the game into a losing position for Alice on her turn.

So, if the game starts at a losing position, then the first player (Alice) cannot force a win, so Bob can.\n\nThus, the answer is 809.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the small n's, the losing positions were 2,5,7,10,12,15, etc., which fit into 0 and 2 mod5.\n\nSo, the total is 809.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the count.\n\nWait, for 0 mod5 up to 2020: 2020/5=404 numbers.\n\nFor 2 mod5: starting at 2, the numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nThe number of terms is ((2022-2)/5)+1= (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.\n\nSo, 404+405=809.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 809.\n\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) for which Bob can guarantee a win regardless of Alice's play, we analyze the game using combinatorial game theory. The key is to identify the losing positions, where the current player cannot force a win.\n\nA losing position is one where every possible move (removing 1 or 4 tokens) leads to a winning position for the opponent. By examining small values of \\( n \\), we observe a pattern in the losing positions. These positions occur at \\( n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\) and \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\).\n\nTo count the number of such \\( n \\) up to 2024:\n1. **Numbers divisible by 5 (\\( n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\))**: The largest such number \u22642024 is 2020. There are \\( \\frac{2020}{5} = 404 \\) such numbers.\n2. **Numbers congruent to 2 modulo 5 (\\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\))**: These numbers form the sequence 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022. The number of terms in this sequence is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2022 - 2}{5} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 405 \\).\n\nAdding these, the total number of losing positions is \\( 404 + 405 = 809 \\).\n\nThus, the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) where Bob can guarantee a win is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{809}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game where they take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n \u2264 2024 make it so that Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I remember something about winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the next player can force a win.\n\nSo, I think I should model this using dynamic programming or recursion. Let's try to define a function W(n) that returns True if the current player can win with n tokens, and False otherwise.\n\nThe base case is when n = 0. Well, if there are no tokens left, the player can't make a move, so they lose. So W(0) = False.\n\nFor n = 1, the current player can take 1 token and win, so W(1) = True.\n\nn = 2: Player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent who will take it and win. So if n=2, the current player can take 1, forcing the opponent into a winning position? Wait, no, if I take 1, opponent gets 1, which is a winning position for them. So if I have n=2, I can take 1, leaving 1, which is a win for the opponent. Or take 4, but that's not possible because n=2. So W(2) = False? Wait, no, because if I take 1, opponent can win, but I can't take 4, so I have no winning moves. So W(2) = False.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. If the current player can make a move that leaves the opponent in a losing position, then the current position is a winning one. If all possible moves leave the opponent in a winning position, then the current position is a losing one.\n\nSo for n=1: take 1, opponent gets 0, which is losing. So W(1) = True.\n\nn=2: possible moves are take 1, leaving 1 (which is a winning position for opponent). So all moves lead to opponent's win. So W(2) = False.\n\nn=3: take 1, leaving 2 (which is losing for opponent). So W(3) = True.\n\nn=4: take 4, leaving 0 (opponent loses). So W(4) = True.\n\nn=5: possible moves are take 1 (leaving 4, which is a winning position for opponent) or take 4 (leaving 1, which is a winning position for opponent). So both moves leave opponent in a winning position. So W(5) = False.\n\nWait, so n=5 is a losing position? That means if a player is faced with 5 tokens, no matter what they do, the opponent can win.\n\nLet me see the pattern so far:\n\nn : W(n)\n0 : F\n1 : T\n2 : F\n3 : T\n4 : T\n5 : F\n\nHmm, let's compute a few more to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nn=6: can take 1, leaving 5 (F for opponent). So W(6) = True.\n\nn=7: take 1, leaving 6 (T). Take 4, leaving 3 (T). So both moves leave opponent in a winning position. So W(7) = False.\n\nn=8: take 1, leaving 7 (F). So W(8) = True.\n\nn=9: take 1, leaving 8 (T). Take 4, leaving 5 (F). So if I take 4, opponent gets 5, which is losing. So W(9) = True.\n\nn=10: take 1, leaving 9 (T). Take 4, leaving 6 (T). Both options leave opponent in a winning position. So W(10) = False.\n\nWait, so let's list the W(n) up to n=10:\n\n0: F\n1: T\n2: F\n3: T\n4: T\n5: F\n6: T\n7: F\n8: T\n9: T\n10: F\n\nLooking at this, the losing positions seem to be at n=0,2,5,7,10.\n\nHmm, what's the pattern here? Let's see the differences between these losing positions:\n\n2-0=2, 5-2=3, 7-5=2, 10-7=3.\n\nSo the losing positions are increasing by 2, then 3, then 2, then 3... It seems like a cycle of 2,3.\n\nSo maybe the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 mod 5? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, 0 mod 5 is 0, 2 mod5 is 2, 5 mod5 is 0, 7 mod5 is 2, 10 mod5 is 0. Hmm, no, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the losing positions are every 5 tokens. Like 0, 2, 5,7,10,12,15,17,... Wait, but 0 is the end. Let me see:\n\nn=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,...\n\nSo the pattern is adding 2, then 3, alternately. So starting from 0, add 2 to get 2, then add 3 to get 5, add 2 to get 7, add 3 to get 10, add 2 to get 12, add 3 to get 15, etc.\n\nSo the losing positions are numbers that are either 0 mod5 or 2 mod5? Because 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,...\n\nWait, 0 mod5 is 0, 2 mod5 is 2, 5 mod5 is 0, 7 mod5 is 2, 10 mod5 is 0, etc. So the losing positions are numbers that are either 0 or 2 modulo5.\n\nBut wait, let's check n=12: W(12) would be ?\n\nWait, let's compute W(11):\n\nn=11: can take 1, leaving 10 (F), so W(11)=True.\n\nn=12: take 1, leaving 11 (T), take 4, leaving 8 (T). So both options leave opponent in a winning position. So W(12)=False.\n\nn=13: take 1, leaving 12 (F). So W(13)=True.\n\nn=14: take 1, leaving13 (T), take4, leaving10 (F). So if you take 4, opponent gets 10 (F). So W(14)=True.\n\nn=15: take 1, leaving14 (T), take4, leaving11 (T). So both moves leave opponent in a winning position. So W(15)=False.\n\nSo yes, the losing positions are 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... So every 5, it's adding 2 and 3 alternately. So the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo5.\n\nWait, 5 is 0 mod5, 7 is 2 mod5, 10 is 0 mod5, 12 is 2 mod5, etc.\n\nSo the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, but let's test n=20.\n\nn=20: take1, leaving19 (W). Take4, leaving16 (W). So W(20)=False.\n\nYes, 20 is a losing position.\n\nn=21: take1, leaving20 (F), so W(21)=True.\n\nn=22: take1, leaving21 (T), take4, leaving18. Let's see W(18)=?\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Instead of trying to list all, perhaps find a mathematical pattern.\n\nIf the losing positions are numbers where n \u22610 or 2 mod5, then the number of losing positions up to N is roughly (N//5)*2 + something.\n\nWait, let's see. For each 5 numbers, two are losing (0 and 2 mod5). So for every block of 5, 2 are losing positions.\n\nSo up to 2024, how many numbers \u22610 or 2 mod5?\n\nThe number of numbers \u22610 mod5 up to 2024 is floor(2024/5)=404. Because 5*404=2020, and 2024-2020=4, so 404 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5: starting from 2,7,12,... The last one \u22642024 is 2022, because 2022=5*404 + 2=2020+2=2022. So how many terms?\n\nIt's 404 +1 (since starting at 2, which is the first term). Wait, let's compute it.\n\nThe sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.\n\nThis is an arithmetic progression with a=2, d=5, last term l=2022.\n\nNumber of terms: ((2022 -2)/5) +1= (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.\n\nSo numbers \u22610 mod5: 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5:405 numbers.\n\nWait, but 0 is included in the \u22610 mod5, but in our problem, n is positive integers, so n starts at 1. So when considering n\u22651, the numbers \u22610 mod5 are 5,10,...,2020. So how many?\n\n2020/5=404. So 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5 are 2,7,12,...,2022. The first term is 2, which is \u22651. So how many terms?\n\nWe can compute it as (2022 -2)/5 +1= (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo total losing positions would be 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5)=809.\n\nWait, but let me check. For n=1, it's a winning position, n=2 is losing, n=5 is losing, n=7 is losing, etc.\n\nWait, but n=0 is not considered because the problem states positive integers n. So in our case, the losing positions are numbers where n \u22612 mod5 or n\u22610 mod5, but n must be \u22651.\n\nSo n=2,5,7,10,12,15,17,...,2020,2022.\n\nSo in the range 1 to 2024, how many n satisfy n \u22610 mod5 or n\u22612 mod5?\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5: 5,10,15,...,2020. That's 2020/5=404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5:2,7,12,...,2022. The number of terms is (2022 -2)/5 +1= (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo total losing positions:404 +405=809.\n\nBut wait, is 2025 included? No, because n \u22642024. So 2022 is the last term for \u22612 mod5.\n\nSo the total number of losing positions is 809.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. For each 5 numbers, two are losing (0 and 2 mod5), but since we start at n=1, the first losing position is n=2, then n=5, etc.\n\nSo for numbers 1-5:\n\nn=1: W\nn=2: L\nn=3: W\nn=4: W\nn=5: L\n\nSo in 1-5, two losing positions: 2 and5.\n\nSimilarly, 6-10:\n\nn=6: W\nn=7: L\nn=8: W\nn=9: W\nn=10:L\n\nAgain, two losing positions:7 and10.\n\nSo every block of 5 has exactly two losing positions.\n\nSo the number of losing positions from 1 to N is 2*(N//5) + something depending on the remainder.\n\nWait, but in our earlier calculation, for N=2024:\n\n2024 divided by 5 is 404 with a remainder of 4. So 5*404=2020.\n\nSo up to 2020, there are 404 blocks of 5, each contributing 2 losing positions, so 404*2=808.\n\nThen, from 2021 to 2024, which is 4 numbers:2021,2022,2023,2024.\n\nIn these, which are losing positions?\n\nLooking at mod5:\n\n2021 mod5=1 (since 2020 is 0 mod5, 2021=1)\n\n2022 mod5=2 \u2192 losing position.\n\n2023 mod5=3\n\n2024 mod5=4.\n\nSo only 2022 is a losing position in this last partial block.\n\nSo total losing positions:808 +1=809.\n\nSo the number of losing positions up to 2024 is 809.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the question is about the number of positive integers n \u22642024 for which Bob can guarantee a win regardless of Alice's play.\n\nSo in other words, for those n where the starting player (Alice) is in a losing position, Bob can win.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the standard game theory, if the starting position is a losing position, the second player can win. So if n is a losing position, then Alice is in a losing position, so Bob can win.\n\nSo the number of n where n is a losing position is the number of n where Bob can win.\n\nSo that number is 809.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5, which gives us 809 numbers. So the answer should be 809.\n\nBut let me just make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the initial terms to see if the pattern holds.\n\nn : W(n)\n0 : F\n1 : T\n2 : F\n3 : T\n4 : T\n5 : F\n6 : T\n7 : F\n8 : T\n9 : T\n10: F\n11: T\n12: F\n13: T\n14: T\n15: F\n16: T\n17: F\n18: T\n19: T\n20: F\n\nYes, the pattern seems consistent. Every 5 numbers, the losing positions are at positions 0,2 mod5.\n\nSo from n=1 to n=2024, the losing positions are numbers where n \u22610 or 2 mod5. Counting these gives 809 numbers.\n\nSo the answer is 809.\n",

So how many terms?\n\nWe can compute it as (2022 -2)/5 +1= (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo total losing positions would be 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5)=809.\n\nWait, but let me check. For n=1, it's a winning position, n=2 is losing, n=5 is losing, n=7 is losing, etc.\n\nWait, but n=0 is not considered because the problem states positive integers n. So in our case, the losing positions are numbers where n \u22612 mod5 or n\u22610 mod5, but n must be \u22651.\n\nSo n=2,5,7,10,12,15,17,...,2020,2022.\n\nSo in the range 1 to 2024, how many n satisfy n \u22610 mod5 or n\u22612 mod5?\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5: 5,10,15,...,2020. That's 2020/5=404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5:2,7,12,...,2022. The number of terms is (2022 -2)/5 +1= (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.\n\nSo total losing positions:404 +405=809.\n\nBut wait, is 2025 included? No, because n \u22642024. So 2022 is the last term for \u22612 mod5.\n\nSo the total number of losing positions is 809.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. For each 5 numbers, two are losing (0 and 2 mod5), but since we start at n=1, the first losing position is n=2, then n=5, etc.\n\nSo for numbers 1-5:\n\nn=1: W\nn=2: L\nn=3: W\nn=4: W\nn=5: L\n\nSo in 1-5, two losing positions: 2 and5.\n\nSimilarly, 6-10:\n\nn=6: W\nn=7: L\nn=8: W\nn=9: W\nn=10:L\n\nAgain, two losing positions:7 and10.\n\nSo every block of 5 has exactly two losing positions.\n\nSo the number of losing positions from 1 to N is 2*(N//5) + something depending on the remainder.\n\nWait, but in our earlier calculation, for N=2024:\n\n2024 divided by 5 is 404 with a remainder of 4. So 5*404=2020.\n\nSo up to 2020, there are 404 blocks of 5, each contributing 2 losing positions, so 404*2=808.\n\nThen, from 2021 to 2024, which is 4 numbers:2021,2022,2023,2024.\n\nIn these, which are losing positions?\n\nLooking at mod5:\n\n2021 mod5=1 (since 2020 is 0 mod5, 2021=1)\n\n2022 mod5=2 \u2192 losing position.\n\n2023 mod5=3\n\n2024 mod5=4.\n\nSo only 2022 is a losing position in this last partial block.\n\nSo total losing positions:808 +1=809.\n\nSo the number of losing positions up to 2024 is 809.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the question is about the number of positive integers n \u22642024 for which Bob can guarantee a win regardless of Alice's play.\n\nSo in other words, for those n where the starting player (Alice) is in a losing position, Bob can win.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the standard game theory, if the starting position is a losing position, the second player can win. So if n is a losing position, then Alice is in a losing position, so Bob can win.\n\nSo the number of n where n is a losing position is the number of n where Bob can win.\n\nSo that number is 809.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5, which gives us 809 numbers. So the answer should be 809.\n\nBut let me just make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the initial terms to see if the pattern holds.\n\nn : W(n)\n0 : F\n1 : T\n2 : F\n3 : T\n4 : T\n5 : F\n6 : T\n7 : F\n8 : T\n9 : T\n10: F\n11: T\n12: F\n13: T\n14: T\n15: F\n16: T\n17: F\n18: T\n19: T\n20: F\n\nYes, the pattern seems consistent. Every 5 numbers, the losing positions are at positions 0,2 mod5.\n\nSo from n=1 to n=2024, the losing positions are numbers where n \u22610 or 2 mod5. Counting these gives 809 numbers.\n\nSo the answer is 809.\n\n\nAlice and Bob play a game where they take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of \\( n \\) tokens, with Alice going first. The player who removes the last token wins. To determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) where Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game using combinatorial game theory.\n\nWe define a position as a \"winning position\" if the current player can force a win, and a \"losing position\" if the current player will lose no matter what move they make. By examining the game, we find that the losing positions occur at \\( n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\) and \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\). \n\nFor \\( n \\leq 2024 \\), the number of losing positions is calculated as follows:\n- Numbers \\( \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\): There are \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2024}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 404 \\) such numbers.\n- Numbers \\( \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\): These start at 2 and end at 2022, giving \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2022 - 2}{5} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 405 \\) such numbers.\n\nAdding these, the total number of losing positions is \\( 404 + 405 = 809 \\). Therefore, there are 809 values of \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) where Bob can guarantee a win.\n\n\\boxed{809}",
