      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThere are 900 residents. Out of these, 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade. Also, every resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, four items in total: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts.\n\nNow, it's given that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four of these things.\n\nHmm, okay. I remember this is a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nInclusion-exclusion is used to calculate the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on, alternating subtraction and addition.\n\nBut wait, the problem gives me specific numbers about exactly two and exactly three. So maybe I should model this using the principle for four sets, considering the overlaps.\n\nLet me denote the sets as follows:\n- Let D be the set of people who own a diamond ring.\n- Let G be those who own golf clubs.\n- Let S be those with a garden spade.\n- Let C be those with candy hearts.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem says every resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So C is the entire population, right? So C has 900 people.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check: the problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So yes, C = 900.\n\nSo, our four sets are D, G, S, and C (which is everyone). So, the problem is about finding the number of people who are in all four sets, which is D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C.\n\nBut since C is everyone, D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C is just D \u2229 G \u2229 S. Because if someone is in D, G, and S, they are automatically in C.\n\nSo, the question reduces to finding |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|.\n\nAlright, so how do I find that? I think I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets, but I also have the information about exactly two and exactly three.\n\nWait, let me think about the problem again. The problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, the counts for exactly two and exactly three are given. But what about exactly four? That's what we need to find.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the four things include the candy hearts. Since everyone owns candy hearts, any resident who owns all four is included in the counts of those who own three or two as well, right? Because if someone owns all four, they also own three (diamond, golf, spade, and candy). But wait, no, because if someone owns all four, they don't just own three; they own all four. So, when the problem says 234 own exactly three, those 234 don't include the people who own all four.\n\nSo, the people who own exactly three are those who own three of the four, and the people who own all four are a separate category.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't mention the number of people who own all four; that's what we're trying to find. So, our variable is |D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C|, which is the same as |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|, since C includes everyone.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n- a = number of people owning exactly two things.\n- b = number of people owning exactly three things.\n- c = number of people owning exactly four things.\n- d = number of people owning exactly one thing.\n- e = number of people owning none.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, everyone owns at least the candy hearts, right? Because it's given that each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the set C has everyone, so e = 0. No one owns none.\n\nSo, the total number of residents is the sum of people owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four things.\n\nGiven that, the total is d + a + b + c = 900.\n\nWait, but we don't know d or c. Hmm.\n\nBut the problem gives a = 437, b = 234. So, a + b = 437 + 234 = 671. So, d + c = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nBut we need more information to find c, which is the number of people owning all four things.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets, but since all four are involved, maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nWait, since C is everyone, maybe I can think of the problem as having three sets: D, G, S, each of which is a subset of C (which is the entire population). So, the four things are D, G, S, and C. But since C is everyone, any combination that includes C is redundant.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this with the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets, considering that each of D, G, S is a subset of C.\n\nLet me recall the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nBut in our case, since every resident owns at least C (candy hearts), and C is the universal set, the union |D \u222a G \u222a S| is equal to the number of people who own at least one of D, G, or S. But since everyone owns C, the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S is equal to the number of people who don't own all four? Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. C is the entire set, so D, G, S are subsets of C. The union |D \u222a G \u222a S| is the number of people who own at least one of D, G, or S. But since all residents own C, the people who don't own any of D, G, or S are exactly the people who own only C. But in our problem, it's given that everyone owns C, so the number of people who own only C is equal to the number of people who don't own D, G, or S.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify how many people own only C. Hmm.\n\nBut perhaps I can approach this by considering that the total number of people is 900, and the number of people who own at least one of D, G, or S is 900 minus the number who own only C.\n\nWait, but I don't know how many own only C. Hmm. Maybe I can find that using other information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model the problem using the principle for four sets, but since C is universal, perhaps it's redundant. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote:\n- |D| = 195\n- |G| = 367\n- |S| = 562\n- |C| = 900\n\nBut since C is everyone, any intersection involving C is just the other sets. For example, |D \u2229 C| = |D| = 195.\n\nSo, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion for four sets would be complicated, but since C is universal, maybe we can simplify.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider that each resident owns some combination of D, G, S, and C. But since everyone owns C, the possible combinations are:\n\n- Only C\n- C and D\n- C and G\n- C and S\n- C and D and G\n- C and D and S\n- C and G and S\n- C and D and G and S (which is all four)\n\nSo, the possible combinations are these. But we're given that some people own exactly two of the four, exactly three, and so on.\n\nWait, but the problem says 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. So, exactly two things could be any two of the four. But since C is always owned, when someone owns exactly two, it's because they own C plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would be C plus two others, and exactly four is all four.\n\nWait, that's a good point. Because C is always owned, so when someone owns exactly two, it's C plus one more. So, the number of people owning exactly two is the sum of those owning C and D, C and G, C and S. Similarly, exactly three would be C and D and G, C and D and S, C and G and S. And exactly four is C and D and G and S.\n\nSo, the counts are as follows:\n\n- Exactly two: 437 = (C \u2229 D) + (C \u2229 G) + (C \u2229 S) - 3*(C \u2229 D \u2229 G \u2229 S) ??? Wait, no, maybe not.\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, the number of people owning exactly two is equal to the sum of the pairwise intersections minus three times the number of people owning all four. Because each person owning all four is counted in each of the three pairwise intersections.\n\nWait, maybe let me clarify. Let me denote:\n\nLet x = number of people owning exactly two things. So, x = 437.\n\nEach of these exactly two could be:\n\n- C and D only\n- C and G only\n- C and S only\n- D and G only\n- D and S only\n- G and S only\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because C is always present, the exactly two would only involve C and one other. Because if someone owns exactly two, and C is one, then the other is one of D, G, or S. So, exactly two would be C and D, C and G, or C and S. So, the 437 is the sum of these three.\n\nSimilarly, exactly three would be C and two of the others. So, the 234 is the sum of C and D and G, C and D and S, and C and G and S.\n\nAnd exactly four is C, D, G, and S, which is what we're trying to find.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the 437 exactly two is the number of people owning exactly two of the four, which, considering that C is always there, would be C and D, C and G, or C and S. So, the sum of these three is 437.\n\nSimilarly, the 234 exactly three would be the sum of the three cases where someone owns C plus two of the other three. So, C and D and G, C and D and S, C and G and S.\n\nAnd the exactly four is C, D, G, S, which is our unknown.\n\nSo, let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\na = number of people owning exactly C and D (so, C \u2229 D minus those who own all three and C and D and others)\nb = number of people owning exactly C and G\nc = number of people owning exactly C and S\nd = number of people owning exactly D and G (without C)\ne = number of people owning exactly D and S (without C)\nf = number of people owning exactly G and S (without C)\ng = number of people owning exactly C, D, and G\nh = number of people owning exactly C, D, and S\ni = number of people owning exactly C, G, and S\nj = number of people owning all four, which is C, D, G, S.\n\nWait, this might get complicated, but perhaps I can express the given values in terms of these variables.\n\nWe know that the number of people owning exactly two things is 437. From above, these would be a + b + c + d + e + f. Wait, no, no. Wait, no, because a, b, c are exactly two (C and D, etc.), while d, e, f are exactly two without C, which is not possible because C is always owned. Wait, no, wait: no, if someone owns exactly two things, and C is one, then the other must be one of D, G, or S. So, exactly two would be a + b + c. Because d, e, f are people who own exactly two without C, but since C is universal, those can't exist. So, in this problem, all people must own C, so exactly two things would mean exactly two including C. So, exactly two would be a + b + c = 437.\n\nSimilarly, exactly three would be g + h + i = 234.\n\nExactly four is j = ?\n\nAnd exactly one would be the people who own only C, which is, let's say, k.\n\nSo, the total population is k (only C) + a (C and D) + b (C and G) + c (C and S) + g (C, D, G) + h (C, D, S) + i (C, G, S) + j (all four) = 900.\n\nSo, k + a + b + c + g + h + i + j = 900.\n\nBut we also know that a + b + c = 437 (exactly two) and g + h + i = 234 (exactly three). So, substituting, k + 437 + 234 + j = 900. So, k + j = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, k + j = 229.\n\nHmm, but we don't know k or j yet.\n\nWe also know that the total number of people owning D is 195. Let's think about that. The number of people owning D is the sum of all subsets that include D. So, that's a (C and D only) + g (C, D, G) + h (C, D, S) + j (all four). So:\n\na + g + h + j = 195.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning G is 367. That would be b (C and G) + g (C, D, G) + i (C, G, S) + j.\n\nSo:\n\nb + g + i + j = 367.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning S is 562. That would be c (C and S) + h (C, D, S) + i (C, G, S) + j.\n\nSo:\n\nc + h + i + j = 562.\n\nAlso, the number of people owning C is 900, which is everyone, so that's already accounted for.\n\nNow, we have four equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = 437 (exactly two)\n2. g + h + i = 234 (exactly three)\n3. k + j = 229 (from total population)\n4. a + g + h + j = 195 (from |D|)\n5. b + g + i + j = 367 (from |G|)\n6. c + h + i + j = 562 (from |S|)\n\nHmm, that's a lot of equations. Let me see if I can find j from these.\n\nLet me try to express a, b, c in terms of other variables.\n\nFrom equation 4: a = 195 - g - h - j.\n\nFrom equation 5: b = 367 - g - i - j.\n\nFrom equation 6: c = 562 - h - i - j.\n\nNow, substitute a, b, c into equation 1:\n\n(195 - g - h - j) + (367 - g - i - j) + (562 - h - i - j) = 437.\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\n195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.\n\nThen, subtract (g + h + j) + (g + i + j) + (h + i + j) = 2g + 2h + 2i + 3j.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n1124 - (2g + 2h + 2i + 3j) = 437.\n\nSo, 1124 - 437 = 2g + 2h + 2i + 3j.\n\n1124 - 437 is 687.\n\nSo, 687 = 2(g + h + i) + 3j.\n\nBut from equation 2, we know that g + h + i = 234.\n\nSo, substitute that in:\n\n687 = 2*234 + 3j.\n\n2*234 is 468.\n\nSo, 687 = 468 + 3j.\n\nSubtract 468: 687 - 468 = 219 = 3j.\n\nSo, j = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nSo, j is 73.\n\nTherefore, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.\n\nWait, let me check if that makes sense.\n\nSo, j = 73.\n\nFrom equation 3: k + 73 = 229 \u2192 k = 229 -73 = 156.\n\nSo, 156 people own only C (candy hearts).\n\nNow, let's check the other equations.\n\nFrom equation 4: a + g + h + 73 = 195 \u2192 a + g + h = 122.\n\nFrom equation 5: b + g + i +73 = 367 \u2192 b + g + i = 294.\n\nFrom equation 6: c + h + i +73 =562 \u2192 c + h + i = 489.\n\nFrom equation 1: a + b + c =437.\n\nWe can also compute a, b, c in terms of other variables.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to check if all numbers fit.\n\nWe also know from equation 2: g + h + i =234.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nFrom equation 4: a = 195 - g - h -73 \u2192 a = 122 - g - h.\n\nFrom equation 5: b =367 -g - i -73 \u2192 b=294 -g -i.\n\nFrom equation 6: c=562 -h -i -73 \u2192 c=489 -h -i.\n\nThen, a + b + c = (122 -g -h) + (294 -g -i) + (489 -h -i) = 122 + 294 + 489 - 2g - 2h - 2i.\n\nWhich is 805 - 2(g + h + i).\n\nBut from equation 2, g + h + i =234, so 805 - 2*234 =805 -468=337.\n\nWait, but equation 1 says a + b + c =437. But according to this, it's 337. That's a discrepancy. So, something's wrong.\n\nHmm, so I must have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me go back step by step.\n\nWait, when I substituted a, b, c into equation 1, maybe I made an error there.\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nFrom equation 4: a = 195 -g -h -j.\n\nFrom equation 5: b = 367 -g -i -j.\n\nFrom equation 6: c =562 -h -i -j.\n\nSubstituting these into equation 1: a + b + c =437.\n\nSo,\n\n(195 -g -h -j) + (367 -g -i -j) + (562 -h -i -j) =437.\n\nAdding these up:\n\n195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.\n\nNow, the negative terms:\n\n- g - h - j - g - i - j - h - i - j.\n\nWhich is:\n\n-2g -2h -2i -3j.\n\nSo, 1124 - (2g + 2h + 2i +3j) =437.\n\nSo, 2g + 2h +2i +3j =1124 -437=687.\n\nBut from equation 2: g + h + i =234.\n\nSo, 2*(g +h +i) =468.\n\nSo, 2g +2h +2i=468.\n\nThen, 468 +3j=687 \u21923j=687-468=219 \u2192j=73. So that part is correct.\n\nBut then, when I tried to compute a + b + c, I got 337, which doesn't match the given 437. So, there's a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, let me compute a + b + c again.\n\na =195 -g -h -j.\n\nb=367 -g -i -j.\n\nc=562 -h -i -j.\n\nSo, a + b + c = (195 + 367 + 562) - (g + h + j + g + i + j + h + i + j).\n\nWhich is 1124 - (2g + 2h + 2i +3j).\n\nWhich is 1124 - (2*(g +h +i) +3j).\n\nWe know that g + h + i =234, so 2*234=468. So,\n\n1124 - (468 +3j) =1124 -468 -3j=656 -3j.\n\nBut from equation 1, a + b + c=437. So,\n\n656 -3j=437 \u21923j=656-437=219 \u2192j=73.\n\nWhich is consistent. So, no problem here.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed a + b + c using the expressions for a, b, c, I got 337. Let me check that again.\n\na=122 -g -h.\n\nb=294 -g -i.\n\nc=489 -h -i.\n\nSo, a + b + c = (122 -g -h) + (294 -g -i) + (489 -h -i).\n\nWhich is 122 +294 +489 =805.\n\nSubtract (g + h +g +i +h +i)=2g +2h +2i.\n\nSo, a + b + c=805 -2(g + h +i).\n\nFrom equation 2, g + h +i=234 \u2192 2*234=468.\n\nSo, 805 -468=337.\n\nHmm, but equation 1 says a + b + c=437, but this calculation gives 337. That's a problem.\n\nWait, so where is the mistake? Because according to the first substitution, a + b + c=656 -3j=656 -219=437, which matches equation 1.\n\nBut when I compute a + b + c as (122 -g -h) + (294 -g -i) + (489 -h -i), I get 337, which is a discrepancy.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake in expressing a, b, c.\n\nWait, let me re-express a, b, c correctly.\n\nFrom equation 4: a =195 -g -h -j.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nFrom equation 5: b=367 -g -i -j.\n\nFrom equation 6: c=562 -h -i -j.\n\nSo, a + b + c= (195 -g -h -j) + (367 -g -i -j) + (562 -h -i -j).\n\nSo, summing the numbers:195+367=562, 562+562=1124.\n\nThen, the terms with g, h, i, j:\n\n- g -h -j -g -i -j -h -i -j.\n\nThat's:\n\n-2g -2h -2i -3j.\n\nSo, a + b + c=1124 - (2g +2h +2i +3j).\n\nWhich equals 1124 - [2(g +h +i) +3j].\n\nWe know that g +h +i=234, so 2*234=468.\n\nThus, a +b +c=1124 - (468 +3j) = 1124 -468 -3j =656 -3j.\n\nBut from equation 1, a + b + c=437.\n\nSo, 656 -3j=437 \u21923j=656-437=219 \u2192j=73.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nBut when I compute a, b, c as a=122 -g -h, b=294 -g -i, c=489 -h -i, and then a + b + c=337, that's a problem.\n\nWait, where did I get those expressions for a, b, c?\n\nFrom equation 4: a + g + h + j=195 \u2192 a=195 -g -h -j.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nFrom equation 5: b=367 -g -i -j.\n\nFrom equation 6: c=562 -h -i -j.\n\nBut when I plug these into equation 1, I get a +b +c=437.\n\nBut when I compute a +b +c as (122 -g -h) + (294 -g -i) + (489 -h -i), I get 337, which is inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that a=122 -g -h. Let me check:\n\nWait, equation 4 is a + g + h + j =195.\n\nSo, a =195 -g -h -j.\n\nSimilarly, equation 5: b=367 -g -i -j.\n\nEquation 6: c=562 -h -i -j.\n\nSo, a + b + c= (195 -g -h -j) + (367 -g -i -j) + (562 -h -i -j).\n\nWhich is 195+367+562=1124.\n\nMinus (g + h +j +g +i +j +h +i +j)= 2g + 2h +2i +3j.\n\nSo, 1124 - (2g +2h +2i +3j)=437.\n\nWhich leads to 2(g +h +i) +3j=687.\n\nAnd since g +h +i=234, 2*234=468.\n\nSo, 468 +3j=687 \u21923j=219 \u2192j=73.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nBut when I compute a + b +c as (122 -g -h) + (294 -g -i) + (489 -h -i), I get 337. So, why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating a, b, c.\n\nWait, let me compute a + b +c again.\n\na=195 -g -h -j.\n\nb=367 -g -i -j.\n\nc=562 -h -i -j.\n\nSo,\n\na + b +c = 195 +367 +562 - (g + h +j +g +i +j +h +i +j).\n\nWhich is 1124 - (2g +2h +2i +3j).\n\nWhich is 1124 - (2*(g +h +i) +3j).\n\nWhich is 1124 - (2*234 +3*73).\n\nCompute 2*234=468, 3*73=219.\n\nSo, 468 +219=687.\n\n1124 -687=437, which matches equation 1.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought a=122 -g -h, that's not correct.\n\nWait, where did I get a=122 -g -h?\n\nAh, no, equation 4 is a + g + h +j=195 \u2192 a=195 -g -h -j.\n\nWhich is correct. But when I computed a + b +c as (122 -g -h) + (294 -g -i) + (489 -h -i), that's not correct because a is 195 -g -h -j, not 122 -g -h.\n\nWait, wait, where did 122 come from?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in an earlier step. Let me check.\n\nIn equation 4: a + g + h + j=195.\n\nSo, a=195 -g -h -j.\n\nSimilarly, equation 5: b=367 -g -i -j.\n\nEquation 6: c=562 -h -i -j.\n\nSo, a +b +c= (195 -g -h -j) + (367 -g -i -j) + (562 -h -i -j).\n\nWhich is 1124 - (2g +2h +2i +3j) =437.\n\nWhich we know is correct.\n\nBut when I tried to compute a +b +c as (122 -g -h) + (294 -g -i) + (489 -h -i), that was a mistake because a is 195 -g -h -j, not 122 -g -h.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute a, b, c using the correct expressions.\n\nSo, a=195 -g -h -j.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 5: b=367 -g -i -j.\n\nFrom equation 6: c=562 -h -i -j.\n\nSo, a +b +c= (195 +367 +562) - (g +h +j +g +i +j +h +i +j).\n\nWhich is 1124 - (2g +2h +2i +3j).\n\nWhich equals 437, as before.\n\nBut when I computed a +b +c as (122 -g -h) + (294 -g -i) + (489 -h -i), I think I was using incorrect intermediate steps.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nWe have:\n\nFrom equation 4: a +g +h +j=195 \u2192 a=195 -g -h -j.\n\nFrom equation 5: b +g +i +j=367 \u2192 b=367 -g -i -j.\n\nFrom equation 6: c +h +i +j=562 \u2192 c=562 -h -i -j.\n\nSo, a +b +c= (195 -g -h -j) + (367 -g -i -j) + (562 -h -i -j).\n\nWhich is 195+367+562=1124.\n\nSubtract (g +h +j +g +i +j +h +i +j)= 2g +2h +2i +3j.\n\nSo, 1124 - (2g +2h +2i +3j)=437.\n\nWhich gives 2(g +h +i) +3j=687.\n\nSince g +h +i=234, 2*234=468. So, 468 +3j=687 \u2192 j=73.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThere are 900 residents. Out of these, 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade. Also, every resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, four items in total: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts.\n\nNow, it's given that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four of these things.\n\nHmm, okay. I remember this is a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nInclusion-exclusion is used to calculate the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on, alternating subtraction and addition.\n\nBut wait, the problem gives me specific numbers about exactly two and exactly three. So maybe I should model this using the principle for four sets, considering the overlaps.\n\nLet me denote the sets as follows:\n- Let D be the set of people who own a diamond ring.\n- Let G be those who own golf clubs.\n- Let S be those with a garden spade.\n- Let C be those with candy hearts.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem says every resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So C is the entire population, right? So C has 900 people.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check: the problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So yes, C = 900.\n\nSo, our four sets are D, G, S, and C (which is everyone). So, the problem is about finding the number of people who are in all four sets, which is D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C.\n\nBut since C is everyone, D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C is just D \u2229 G \u2229 S. Because if someone is in D, G, and S, they are automatically in C.\n\nSo, the question reduces to finding |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|.\n\nAlright, so how do I find that? I think I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets, but I also have the information about exactly two and exactly three.\n\nWait, let me think about the problem again. The problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, the counts for exactly two and exactly three are given. But what about exactly four? That's what we need to find.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the four things include the candy hearts. Since everyone owns candy hearts, any resident who owns all four is included in the counts of those who own three or two as well, right? Because if someone owns all four, they also own three (diamond, golf, spade, and candy). But wait, no, because if someone owns all four, they don't just own three; they own all four. So, when the problem says 234 own exactly three, those 234 don't include the people who own all four.\n\nSo, the people who own exactly three are those who own three of the four, and the people who own all four are a separate category.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't mention the number of people who own all four; that's what we're trying to find. So, our variable is |D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C|, which is the same as |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|, since C includes everyone.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n- a = number of people owning exactly two things.\n- b = number of people owning exactly three things.\n- c = number of people owning exactly four things.\n- d = number of people owning exactly one thing.\n- e = number of people owning none.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, everyone owns at least the candy hearts, right? Because it's given that each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the set C has everyone, so e = 0. No one owns none.\n\nSo, the total number of residents is the sum of people owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four things.\n\nGiven that, the total is d + a + b + c = 900.\n\nWait, but we don't know d or c. Hmm.\n\nBut the problem gives a = 437, b = 234. So, a + b = 437 + 234 = 671. So, d + c = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nBut we need more information to find c, which is the number of people owning all four things.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets, but since all four are involved, maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nWait, since C is everyone, maybe I can think of the problem as having three sets: D, G, S, each of which is a subset of C (which is the entire population). So, the four things are D, G, S, and C. But since C is everyone, any combination that includes C is redundant.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this with the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets, considering that each of D, G, S is a subset of C.\n\nLet me recall the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nBut in our case, since every resident owns at least C (candy hearts), and C is the universal set, the union |D \u222a G \u222a S| is equal to the number of people who own at least one of D, G, or S. But since everyone owns C, the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S is equal to the number of people who don't own all four? Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. C is the entire set, so D, G, S are subsets of C. The union |D \u222a G \u222a S| is the number of people who own at least one of D, G, or S. But since all residents own C, the people who don't own any of D, G, or S are exactly the people who own only C. But in our problem, it's given that everyone owns C, so the number of people who own only C is equal to the number of people who don't own D, G, or S.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify how many people own only C. Hmm.\n\nBut perhaps I can approach this by considering that the total number of people is 900, and the number of people who own at least one of D, G, or S is 900 minus the number who own only C.\n\nWait, but I don't know how many own only C. Hmm. Maybe I can find that using other information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model the problem using the principle for four sets, but since C is universal, perhaps it's redundant. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote:\n- |D| = 195\n- |G| = 367\n- |S| = 562\n- |C| = 900\n\nBut since C is everyone, any intersection involving C is just the other sets. For example, |D \u2229 C| = |D| = 195.\n\nSo, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion for four sets would be complicated, but since C is universal, maybe we can simplify.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider that each resident owns some combination of D, G, S, and C. But since everyone owns C, the possible combinations are:\n\n- Only C\n- C and D\n- C and G\n- C and S\n- C and D and G\n- C and D and S\n- C and G and S\n- C and D and G and S (which is all four)\n\nSo, the possible combinations are these. But we're given that some people own exactly two of the four, exactly three, and so on.\n\nWait, but the problem says 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. So, exactly two things could be any two of the four. But since C is always owned, when someone owns exactly two, it's because they own C plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would be C plus two others, and exactly four is all four.\n\nWait, that's a good point. Because C is always owned, so when someone owns exactly two, it's C plus one more. So, the number of people owning exactly two is the sum of those owning C and D, C and G, C and S. Similarly, exactly three would be C and D and G, C and D and S, C and G and S. And exactly four is C and D and G and S.\n\nSo, the counts are as follows:\n\n- Exactly two: 437 = (C \u2229 D) + (C \u2229 G) + (C \u2229 S) - 3*(C \u2229 D \u2229 G \u2229 S) ??? Wait, no, maybe not.\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, the number of people owning exactly two is equal to the sum of the pairwise intersections minus three times the number of people owning all four. Because each person owning all four is counted in each of the three pairwise intersections.\n\nWait, maybe let me clarify. Let me denote:\n\nLet x = number of people owning exactly two things. So, x = 437.\n\nEach of these exactly two could be:\n\n- C and D only\n- C and G only\n- C and S only\n- D and G only\n- D and S only\n- G and S only\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because C is always present, the exactly two would only involve C and one other. Because if someone owns exactly two, and C is one, then the other is one of D, G, or S. So, exactly two would be C and D, C and G, or C and S. So, the 437 is the sum of these three.\n\nSimilarly, exactly three would be C and two of the others. So, the 234 is the sum of C and D and G, C and D and S, and C and G and S.\n\nAnd exactly four is C, D, G, and S, which is what we're trying to find.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the 437 exactly two is the number of people owning exactly two of the four, which, considering that C is always there, would be C and D, C and G, or C and S. So, the sum of these three is 437.\n\nSimilarly, the 234 exactly three would be the sum of the three cases where someone owns C plus two of the other three. So, C and D and G, C and D and S, C and G and S.\n\nAnd the exactly four is C, D, G, S, which is our unknown.\n\nSo, let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\na = number of people owning exactly C and D (so, C \u2229 D minus those who own all three and C and D and others)\nb = number of people owning exactly C and G\nc = number of people owning exactly C and S\nd = number of people owning exactly D and G (without C)\ne = number of people owning exactly D and S (without C)\nf = number of people owning exactly G and S (without C)\ng = number of people owning exactly C, D, and G\nh = number of people owning exactly C, D, and S\ni = number of people owning exactly C, G, and S\nj = number of people owning all four, which is C, D, G, S.\n\nWait, this might get complicated, but perhaps I can express the given values in terms of these variables.\n\nWe know that the number of people owning exactly two things is 437. From above, these would be a + b + c + d + e + f. Wait, no, no. Wait, no, because a, b, c are exactly two (C and D, etc.), while d, e, f are exactly two without C, which is not possible because C is always owned. Wait, no, wait: no, if someone owns exactly two things, and C is one, then the other must be one of D, G, or S. So, exactly two would be a + b + c. Because d, e, f are people who own exactly two without C, but since C is universal, those can't exist. So, in this problem, all people must own C, so exactly two things would mean exactly two including C. So, exactly two would be a + b + c = 437.\n\nSimilarly, exactly three would be g + h + i = 234.\n\nExactly four is j = ?\n\nAnd exactly one would be the people who own only C, which is, let's say, k.\n\nSo, the total population is k (only C) + a (C and D) + b (C and G) + c (C and S) + g (C, D, G) + h (C, D, S) + i (C, G, S) + j (all four) = 900.\n\nSo, k + a + b + c + g + h + i + j = 900.\n\nBut we also know that a + b + c = 437 (exactly two) and g + h + i = 234 (exactly three). So, substituting, k + 437 + 234 + j = 900. So, k + j = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, k + j = 229.\n\nHmm, but we don't know k or j yet.\n\nWe also know that the total number of people owning D is 195. Let's think about that. The number of people owning D is the sum of all subsets that include D. So, that's a (C and D only) + g (C, D, G) + h (C, D, S) + j (all four). So:\n\na + g + h + j = 195.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning G is 367. That would be b (C and G) + g (C, D, G) + i (C, G, S) + j.\n\nSo:\n\nb + g + i + j = 367.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning S is 562. That would be c (C and S) + h (C, D, S) + i (C, G, S) + j.\n\nSo:\n\nc + h + i + j = 562.\n\nAlso, the number of people owning C is 900, which is everyone, so that's already accounted for.\n\nNow, we have four equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = 437 (exactly two)\n2. g + h + i = 234 (exactly three)\n3. k + j = 229 (from total population)\n4. a + g + h + j = 195 (from |D|)\n5. b + g + i + j = 367 (from |G|)\n6. c + h + i + j = 562 (from |S|)\n\nHmm, that's a lot of equations. Let me see if I can find j from these.\n\nLet me try to express a, b, c in terms of other variables.\n\nFrom equation 4: a = 195 - g - h - j.\n\nFrom equation 5: b = 367 - g - i - j.\n\nFrom equation 6: c = 562 - h - i - j.\n\nNow, substitute a, b, c into equation 1:\n\n(195 - g - h - j) + (367 - g - i - j) + (562 - h - i - j) = 437.\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\n195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.\n\nThen, subtract (g + h + j) + (g + i + j) + (h + i + j) = 2g + 2h + 2i + 3j.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n1124 - (2g + 2h + 2i + 3j) = 437.\n\nSo, 1124 - 437 = 2g + 2h + 2i + 3j.\n\n1124 - 437 is 687.\n\nSo, 687 = 2(g + h + i) + 3j.\n\nBut from equation 2, we know that g + h + i = 234.\n\nSo, substitute that in:\n\n687 = 2*234 + 3j.\n\n2*234 is 468.\n\nSo, 687 = 468 + 3j.\n\nSubtract 468: 687 - 468 = 219 = 3j.\n\nSo, j = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nSo, j is 73.\n\nTherefore, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.\n\nWait, let me check if that makes sense.\n\nSo, j = 73.\n\nFrom equation 3: k + 73 = 229 \u2192 k = 229 -73 = 156.\n\nSo, 156 people own only C (candy hearts).\n\nNow, let's check the other equations.\n\nFrom equation 4: a + g + h + 73 = 195 \u2192 a + g + h = 122.\n\nFrom equation 5: b + g + i +73 = 367 \u2192 b + g + i = 294.\n\nFrom equation 6: c + h + i +73 =562 \u2192 c + h + i = 489.\n\nFrom equation 1: a + b + c =437.\n\nWe can also compute a, b, c in terms of other variables.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to check if all numbers fit.\n\nWe also know from equation 2: g + h + i =234.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nFrom equation 4: a = 195 - g - h -73 \u2192 a = 122 - g - h.\n\nFrom equation 5: b =367 -g - i -73 \u2192 b=294 -g -i.\n\nFrom equation 6: c=562 -h -i -73 \u2192 c=489 -h -i.\n\nThen, a + b + c = (122 -g -h) + (294 -g -i) + (489 -h -i) = 122 + 294 + 489 - 2g - 2h - 2i.\n\nWhich is 805 - 2(g + h + i).\n\nBut from equation 2, g + h + i =234, so 805 - 2*234 =805 -468=337.\n\nWait, but equation 1 says a + b + c =437. But according to this, it's 337. That's a discrepancy. So, something's wrong.\n\nHmm, so I must have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me go back step by step.\n\nWait, when I substituted a, b, c into equation 1, maybe I made an error there.\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nFrom equation 4: a = 195 -g -h -j.\n\nFrom equation 5: b = 367 -g -i -j.\n\nFrom equation 6: c =562 -h -i -j.\n\nSubstituting these into equation 1: a + b + c =437.\n\nSo,\n\n(195 -g -h -j) + (367 -g -i -j) + (562 -h -i -j) =437.\n\nAdding these up:\n\n195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.\n\nNow, the negative terms:\n\n- g - h - j - g - i - j - h - i - j.\n\nWhich is:\n\n-2g -2h -2i -3j.\n\nSo, 1124 - (2g + 2h + 2i +3j) =437.\n\nSo, 2g + 2h +2i +3j =1124 -437=687.\n\nBut from equation 2: g + h + i =234.\n\nSo, 2*(g +h +i) =468.\n\nSo, 2g +2h +2i=468.\n\nThen, 468 +3j=687 \u21923j=687-468=219 \u2192j=73. So that part is correct.\n\nBut then, when I tried to compute a + b + c, I got 337, which doesn't match the given 437. So, there's a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, let me compute a + b + c again.\n\na =195 -g -h -j.\n\nb=367 -g -i -j.\n\nc=562 -h -i -j.\n\nSo, a + b + c = (195 + 367 + 562) - (g + h + j + g + i + j + h + i + j).\n\nWhich is 1124 - (2g + 2h + 2i +3j).\n\nWhich is 1124 - (2*(g +h +i) +3j).\n\nWe know that g + h + i =234, so 2*234=468. So,\n\n1124 - (468 +3j) =1124 -468 -3j=656 -3j.\n\nBut from equation 1, a + b + c=437. So,\n\n656 -3j=437 \u21923j=656-437=219 \u2192j=73.\n\nWhich is consistent. So, no problem here.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed a + b + c using the expressions for a, b, c, I got 337.

That's a problem.\n\nWait, so where is the mistake? Because according to the first substitution, a + b + c=656 -3j=656 -219=437, which matches equation 1.\n\nBut when I compute a + b + c as (122 -g -h) + (294 -g -i) + (489 -h -i), I get 337, which is a discrepancy.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake in expressing a, b, c.\n\nWait, let me re-express a, b, c correctly.\n\nFrom equation 4: a =195 -g -h -j.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nFrom equation 5: b=367 -g -i -j.\n\nFrom equation 6: c=562 -h -i -j.\n\nSo, a + b + c= (195 -g -h -j) + (367 -g -i -j) + (562 -h -i -j).\n\nSo, summing the numbers:195+367=562, 562+562=1124.\n\nThen, the terms with g, h, i, j:\n\n- g -h -j -g -i -j -h -i -j.\n\nThat's:\n\n-2g -2h -2i -3j.\n\nSo, a + b + c=1124 - (2g +2h +2i +3j).\n\nWhich equals 1124 - [2(g +h +i) +3j].\n\nWe know that g +h +i=234, so 2*234=468.\n\nThus, a +b +c=1124 - (468 +3j) = 1124 -468 -3j =656 -3j.\n\nBut from equation 1, a + b + c=437.\n\nSo, 656 -3j=437 \u21923j=656-437=219 \u2192j=73.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nBut when I compute a, b, c as a=122 -g -h, b=294 -g -i, c=489 -h -i, and then a + b + c=337, that's a problem.\n\nWait, where did I get those expressions for a, b, c?\n\nFrom equation 4: a + g + h + j=195 \u2192 a=195 -g -h -j.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nFrom equation 5: b=367 -g -i -j.\n\nFrom equation 6: c=562 -h -i -j.\n\nBut when I plug these into equation 1, I get a +b +c=437.\n\nBut when I compute a +b +c as (122 -g -h) + (294 -g -i) + (489 -h -i), I get 337, which is inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that a=122 -g -h. Let me check:\n\nWait, equation 4 is a + g + h + j =195.\n\nSo, a =195 -g -h -j.\n\nSimilarly, equation 5: b=367 -g -i -j.\n\nEquation 6: c=562 -h -i -j.\n\nSo, a + b + c= (195 -g -h -j) + (367 -g -i -j) + (562 -h -i -j).\n\nWhich is 195+367+562=1124.\n\nMinus (g + h +j +g +i +j +h +i +j)= 2g + 2h +2i +3j.\n\nSo, 1124 - (2g +2h +2i +3j)=437.\n\nWhich leads to 2(g +h +i) +3j=687.\n\nAnd since g +h +i=234, 2*234=468.\n\nSo, 468 +3j=687 \u21923j=219 \u2192j=73.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nBut when I compute a + b +c as (122 -g -h) + (294 -g -i) + (489 -h -i), I get 337. So, why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating a, b, c.\n\nWait, let me compute a + b +c again.\n\na=195 -g -h -j.\n\nb=367 -g -i -j.\n\nc=562 -h -i -j.\n\nSo,\n\na + b +c = 195 +367 +562 - (g + h +j +g +i +j +h +i +j).\n\nWhich is 1124 - (2g +2h +2i +3j).\n\nWhich is 1124 - (2*(g +h +i) +3j).\n\nWhich is 1124 - (2*234 +3*73).\n\nCompute 2*234=468, 3*73=219.\n\nSo, 468 +219=687.\n\n1124 -687=437, which matches equation 1.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought a=122 -g -h, that's not correct.\n\nWait, where did I get a=122 -g -h?\n\nAh, no, equation 4 is a + g + h +j=195 \u2192 a=195 -g -h -j.\n\nWhich is correct. But when I computed a + b +c as (122 -g -h) + (294 -g -i) + (489 -h -i), that's not correct because a is 195 -g -h -j, not 122 -g -h.\n\nWait, wait, where did 122 come from?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in an earlier step. Let me check.\n\nIn equation 4: a + g + h + j=195.\n\nSo, a=195 -g -h -j.\n\nSimilarly, equation 5: b=367 -g -i -j.\n\nEquation 6: c=562 -h -i -j.\n\nSo, a +b +c= (195 -g -h -j) + (367 -g -i -j) + (562 -h -i -j).\n\nWhich is 1124 - (2g +2h +2i +3j) =437.\n\nWhich we know is correct.\n\nBut when I tried to compute a +b +c as (122 -g -h) + (294 -g -i) + (489 -h -i), that was a mistake because a is 195 -g -h -j, not 122 -g -h.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute a, b, c using the correct expressions.\n\nSo, a=195 -g -h -j.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 5: b=367 -g -i -j.\n\nFrom equation 6: c=562 -h -i -j.\n\nSo, a +b +c= (195 +367 +562) - (g +h +j +g +i +j +h +i +j).\n\nWhich is 1124 - (2g +2h +2i +3j).\n\nWhich equals 437, as before.\n\nBut when I computed a +b +c as (122 -g -h) + (294 -g -i) + (489 -h -i), I think I was using incorrect intermediate steps.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nWe have:\n\nFrom equation 4: a +g +h +j=195 \u2192 a=195 -g -h -j.\n\nFrom equation 5: b +g +i +j=367 \u2192 b=367 -g -i -j.\n\nFrom equation 6: c +h +i +j=562 \u2192 c=562 -h -i -j.\n\nSo, a +b +c= (195 -g -h -j) + (367 -g -i -j) + (562 -h -i -j).\n\nWhich is 195+367+562=1124.\n\nSubtract (g +h +j +g +i +j +h +i +j)= 2g +2h +2i +3j.\n\nSo, 1124 - (2g +2h +2i +3j)=437.\n\nWhich gives 2(g +h +i) +3j=687.\n\nSince g +h +i=234, 2*234=468. So, 468 +3j=687 \u2192 j=73.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the given data.\n\nGiven:\n- Total residents: 900\n- Residents owning a diamond ring (D): 195\n- Residents owning golf clubs (G): 367\n- Residents owning a garden spade (S): 562\n- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (C), so |C| = 900.\n- Residents owning exactly two items: 437\n- Residents owning exactly three items: 234\n\nSince C is universal, we need to find the number of residents who own all four items, which is |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|.\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle and the given data, we set up the following equations:\n\n1. **Exactly two items**: \\( a + b + c = 437 \\) (where \\( a, b, c \\) are residents owning exactly two of D, G, S with C)\n2. **Exactly three items**: \\( g + h + i = 234 \\) (where \\( g, h, i \\) are residents owning exactly three of D, G, S with C)\n3. **Total population**: \\( k + a + b + c + g + h + i + j = 900 \\) (where \\( k \\) is residents owning only C, and \\( j \\) is residents owning all four)\n4.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states there are 900 residents. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's one thing that everyone has. Then there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers given are 195 own diamond rings, 367 own golf clubs, and 562 own garden spades. \n\nAlso, we're told that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking how many own all four\u2014so that's the candy hearts plus the other three items.\n\nHmm, okay. So this is a problem about sets and their intersections. I remember that when dealing with multiple sets, the principle of inclusion-exclusion is useful. But since there are four things here, it might get a bit complicated.\n\nLet me think. Each resident owns at least one thing, but actually, since everyone owns the candy hearts, maybe that's the universal set here. So, each resident is in at least one of the four sets: diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), or candy hearts (C). But wait, actually, the problem says each owns a bag of candy hearts, so C is universal. So, the other three are subsets of C.\n\nWait, but the problem is about owning exactly two or three of the four items. Hmm. So, perhaps it's better to model this using a Venn diagram with four circles, but that might get too complex. Alternatively, maybe I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about exactly two and exactly three. So, perhaps I should think about how the counts of exactly two and exactly three relate to the total counts.\n\nLet me try to recall the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. The formula is:\n\nTotal = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229S| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut wait, in this problem, C is the universal set since everyone owns candy hearts. So, |C| = 900, and any intersection involving C is just the other sets. For example, |D \u2229 C| is just |D|, because everyone who owns a diamond ring also owns candy hearts. Similarly, |D \u2229 G \u2229 C| is the same as |D \u2229 G|, because C is already included.\n\nWait, that might complicate things. Maybe I should adjust the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each resident owns at least the candy hearts, so when we're talking about owning exactly two things, those two could include candy hearts or not. Wait, but no, because the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so they all have at least that. So, when the problem mentions owning exactly two things, it's referring to exactly two of the four items, including candy hearts.\n\nWait, no. Let me read the problem again. It says, \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, that's one thing everyone has. Then, they can have 0, 1, 2, 3, or all four items. Wait, but the problem says 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, these counts include the candy hearts as one of the four.\n\nSo, when someone owns exactly two things, they could be owning two of D, G, S, and C. Since C is already there, perhaps the other three are optional.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, but they can also own other things. So, the four \"things\" are D, G, S, and C. But since everyone has C, perhaps the other three are optional.\n\nBut maybe the problem is considering the four items as D, G, S, and C, where C is always present. So, when someone owns exactly two things, it's two of D, G, S, plus C. Or maybe not necessarily including C. Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, C is a given. Then, the other three are additional. So, when it says 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a golf club, etc., that's in addition to the candy hearts.\n\nSo, each resident has at least C, and possibly D, G, or S. So, when they say \"exactly two of these things,\" that would mean exactly two of D, G, S, and C. But since C is already present, does that affect the count?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because if someone owns exactly two things, and one of them is C, then the other is one of D, G, or S. Alternatively, if someone owns exactly two, both could be among D, G, S, but that would require them not to have C, which contradicts the problem statement that everyone has C. Therefore, perhaps all residents have at least C, so when they own exactly two, it's C plus one of the others. Similarly, exactly three would be C plus two of the others, and exactly four would be all three others plus C.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the problem is about how many people have exactly two of the four items (including C), exactly three, etc. But since C is always present, the way the counts work is:\n\n- Exactly two items: C plus one more (either D, G, or S)\n- Exactly three items: C plus two more\n- All four items: C plus all three\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"exactly two of these things\" and \"exactly three of these things.\" So, perhaps the counts include C as one of the four. So, the number of residents who own exactly two of the four (including C) is 437. Similarly, exactly three is 234.\n\nSo, the question is to find how many own all four, which is exactly four.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, that's one item. The other three are optional. So, the four items are C, D, G, S. So, each resident has at least C, and may have some combination of D, G, S.\n\nSo, the counts given are:\n\n- Exactly two of the four items: 437\n- Exactly three of the four items: 234\n\nWe need to find exactly four, which would be the number of people who have C, D, G, S\u2014all four.\n\nSo, let's model this.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let a = number of people who have exactly C only (i.e., none of D, G, S)\n- Let b = exactly C and D only\n- Let c = exactly C and G only\n- Let d = exactly C and S only\n- Let e = exactly C, D, G only\n- Let f = exactly C, D, S only\n- Let g = exactly C, G, S only\n- Let h = exactly C, D, G, S (all four)\n\nSo, the total number of residents is the sum of all these: a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900.\n\nWe are told that the number of people who have exactly two of the four is 437. Exactly two would be the cases where exactly two of D, G, S, and C are present. But since C is always present, exactly two would mean C plus one more. So, b + c + d = 437.\n\nSimilarly, exactly three would be C plus two of the others. So, e + f + g = 234.\n\nWe are to find h, the number of people with all four.\n\nWe also know the number of people who own each of D, G, S:\n\n- |D| = 195: this includes all people who have D, regardless of whether they have other items. So, |D| = b + e + f + h.\n\nSimilarly, |G| = 367 = c + e + g + h.\n\n|S| = 562 = d + f + g + h.\n\nSo, we have the equations:\n\n1. a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900\n2. b + c + d = 437 (exactly two)\n3. e + f + g = 234 (exactly three)\n4. |D| = 195 = b + e + f + h\n5. |G| = 367 = c + e + g + h\n6. |S| = 562 = d + f + g + h\n7. We need to find h.\n\nSo, let's see. From equation 2: b + c + d =437.\n\nFrom equation 3: e + f + g =234.\n\nSo, the total number of people is a + (b + c + d) + (e + f + g) + h = a +437 +234 +h = 900.\n\nSo, a + h = 900 - 437 -234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes a + h =229.\n\nBut we don't know a yet. Maybe we can find a from other equations.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can express a in terms of h. Let's say a = 229 - h.\n\nNow, let's consider the counts for D, G, and S.\n\nWe have:\n\nFrom equation 4: 195 = b + e + f + h.\n\nFrom equation 5: 367 = c + e + g + h.\n\nFrom equation 6:562 = d + f + g + h.\n\nNow, let's think about what we know:\n\nWe know b + c + d =437. So, perhaps we can express c and d in terms of b.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to think of each variable in terms of others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can sum equations 4,5,6.\n\nAdding 195 + 367 + 562 = (b + e + f + h) + (c + e + g + h) + (d + f + g + h).\n\nSo, sum of |D| + |G| + |S| = (b + c + d) + 2*(e + f + g) + 3*h.\n\nBecause in the sum:\n\nb + c + d is from each of the first terms,\n\ne is in D, G, S once each, so 3*e,\n\nf is in D and S once each, so 2*f,\n\ng is in G and S once each, so 2*g,\n\nand h is in all three, so 3*h.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nFrom equation 4: b + e + f + h\n\nEquation 5: c + e + g + h\n\nEquation 6: d + f + g + h\n\nAdding these:\n\nb + c + d + e + e + f + f + g + g + h + h + h.\n\nSo, that's (b + c + d) + 2e + 2f + 2g + 3h.\n\nWhich can be written as (b + c + d) + 2*(e + f + g) + 3h.\n\nWe know from equation 2 that (b + c + d) =437.\n\nFrom equation 3, (e + f + g) =234.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nSum of |D| + |G| + |S| = 195 + 367 + 562 = let's calculate that.\n\n195 + 367 = 562, 562 +562 = 1124.\n\nSo, 1124 = 437 + 2*(234) + 3h.\n\nCalculate 2*234 = 468.\n\nSo, 437 + 468 = 905.\n\nSo, 1124 =905 +3h.\n\nSubtract 905 from both sides: 1124 -905 = 219 =3h.\n\nSo, 3h=219 \u2192 h=73.\n\nSo, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nSo, the sum of |D|, |G|, |S| is 1124.\n\nWe expressed that as (b + c + d) + 2*(e + f + g) +3h.\n\nWe know (b + c + d)=437, and (e + f + g)=234.\n\nSo, 437 + 2*(234) +3h =437 +468 +3h=905 +3h.\n\nSet equal to 1124, so 3h=219, h=73.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n",

The formula is:\n\nTotal = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229S| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut wait, in this problem, C is the universal set since everyone owns candy hearts. So, |C| = 900, and any intersection involving C is just the other sets. For example, |D \u2229 C| is just |D|, because everyone who owns a diamond ring also owns candy hearts. Similarly, |D \u2229 G \u2229 C| is the same as |D \u2229 G|, because C is already included.\n\nWait, that might complicate things. Maybe I should adjust the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each resident owns at least the candy hearts, so when we're talking about owning exactly two things, those two could include candy hearts or not. Wait, but no, because the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so they all have at least that. So, when the problem mentions owning exactly two things, it's referring to exactly two of the four items, including candy hearts.\n\nWait, no. Let me read the problem again. It says, \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, that's one thing everyone has. Then, they can have 0, 1, 2, 3, or all four items. Wait, but the problem says 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, these counts include the candy hearts as one of the four.\n\nSo, when someone owns exactly two things, they could be owning two of D, G, S, and C. Since C is already there, perhaps the other three are optional.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, but they can also own other things. So, the four \"things\" are D, G, S, and C. But since everyone has C, perhaps the other three are optional.\n\nBut maybe the problem is considering the four items as D, G, S, and C, where C is always present. So, when someone owns exactly two things, it's two of D, G, S, plus C. Or maybe not necessarily including C. Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, C is a given. Then, the other three are additional. So, when it says 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a golf club, etc., that's in addition to the candy hearts.\n\nSo, each resident has at least C, and possibly D, G, or S. So, when they say \"exactly two of these things,\" that would mean exactly two of D, G, S, and C. But since C is already present, does that affect the count?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because if someone owns exactly two things, and one of them is C, then the other is one of D, G, or S. Alternatively, if someone owns exactly two, both could be among D, G, S, but that would require them not to have C, which contradicts the problem statement that everyone has C. Therefore, perhaps all residents have at least C, so when they own exactly two, it's C plus one of the others. Similarly, exactly three would be C plus two of the others, and exactly four would be all three others plus C.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the problem is about how many people have exactly two of the four items (including C), exactly three, etc. But since C is always present, the way the counts work is:\n\n- Exactly two items: C plus one more (either D, G, or S)\n- Exactly three items: C plus two more\n- All four items: C plus all three\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"exactly two of these things\" and \"exactly three of these things.\" So, perhaps the counts include C as one of the four. So, the number of residents who own exactly two of the four (including C) is 437. Similarly, exactly three is 234.\n\nSo, the question is to find how many own all four, which is exactly four.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, that's one item. The other three are optional. So, the four items are C, D, G, S. So, each resident has at least C, and may have some combination of D, G, S.\n\nSo, the counts given are:\n\n- Exactly two of the four items: 437\n- Exactly three of the four items: 234\n\nWe need to find exactly four, which would be the number of people who have C, D, G, S\u2014all four.\n\nSo, let's model this.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let a = number of people who have exactly C only (i.e., none of D, G, S)\n- Let b = exactly C and D only\n- Let c = exactly C and G only\n- Let d = exactly C and S only\n- Let e = exactly C, D, G only\n- Let f = exactly C, D, S only\n- Let g = exactly C, G, S only\n- Let h = exactly C, D, G, S (all four)\n\nSo, the total number of residents is the sum of all these: a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900.\n\nWe are told that the number of people who have exactly two of the four is 437. Exactly two would be the cases where exactly two of D, G, S, and C are present. But since C is always present, exactly two would mean C plus one more. So, b + c + d = 437.\n\nSimilarly, exactly three would be C plus two of the others. So, e + f + g = 234.\n\nWe are to find h, the number of people with all four.\n\nWe also know the number of people who own each of D, G, S:\n\n- |D| = 195: this includes all people who have D, regardless of whether they have other items. So, |D| = b + e + f + h.\n\nSimilarly, |G| = 367 = c + e + g + h.\n\n|S| = 562 = d + f + g + h.\n\nSo, we have the equations:\n\n1. a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900\n2. b + c + d = 437 (exactly two)\n3. e + f + g = 234 (exactly three)\n4. |D| = 195 = b + e + f + h\n5. |G| = 367 = c + e + g + h\n6. |S| = 562 = d + f + g + h\n7. We need to find h.\n\nSo, let's see. From equation 2: b + c + d =437.\n\nFrom equation 3: e + f + g =234.\n\nSo, the total number of people is a + (b + c + d) + (e + f + g) + h = a +437 +234 +h = 900.\n\nSo, a + h = 900 - 437 -234 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes a + h =229.\n\nBut we don't know a yet. Maybe we can find a from other equations.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can express a in terms of h. Let's say a = 229 - h.\n\nNow, let's consider the counts for D, G, and S.\n\nWe have:\n\nFrom equation 4: 195 = b + e + f + h.\n\nFrom equation 5: 367 = c + e + g + h.\n\nFrom equation 6:562 = d + f + g + h.\n\nNow, let's think about what we know:\n\nWe know b + c + d =437. So, perhaps we can express c and d in terms of b.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to think of each variable in terms of others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can sum equations 4,5,6.\n\nAdding 195 + 367 + 562 = (b + e + f + h) + (c + e + g + h) + (d + f + g + h).\n\nSo, sum of |D| + |G| + |S| = (b + c + d) + 2*(e + f + g) + 3*h.\n\nBecause in the sum:\n\nb + c + d is from each of the first terms,\n\ne is in D, G, S once each, so 3*e,\n\nf is in D and S once each, so 2*f,\n\ng is in G and S once each, so 2*g,\n\nand h is in all three, so 3*h.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nFrom equation 4: b + e + f + h\n\nEquation 5: c + e + g + h\n\nEquation 6: d + f + g + h\n\nAdding these:\n\nb + c + d + e + e + f + f + g + g + h + h + h.\n\nSo, that's (b + c + d) + 2e + 2f + 2g + 3h.\n\nWhich can be written as (b + c + d) + 2*(e + f + g) + 3h.\n\nWe know from equation 2 that (b + c + d) =437.\n\nFrom equation 3, (e + f + g) =234.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nSum of |D| + |G| + |S| = 195 + 367 + 562 = let's calculate that.\n\n195 + 367 = 562, 562 +562 = 1124.\n\nSo, 1124 = 437 + 2*(234) + 3h.\n\nCalculate 2*234 = 468.\n\nSo, 437 + 468 = 905.\n\nSo, 1124 =905 +3h.\n\nSubtract 905 from both sides: 1124 -905 = 219 =3h.\n\nSo, 3h=219 \u2192 h=73.\n\nSo, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nSo, the sum of |D|, |G|, |S| is 1124.\n\nWe expressed that as (b + c + d) + 2*(e + f + g) +3h.\n\nWe know (b + c + d)=437, and (e + f + g)=234.\n\nSo, 437 + 2*(234) +3h =437 +468 +3h=905 +3h.\n\nSet equal to 1124, so 3h=219, h=73.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given data:\n\n- Total residents: 900\n- Residents owning exactly two items: 437\n- Residents owning exactly three items: 234\n- Residents owning a diamond ring (D): 195\n- Residents owning golf clubs (G): 367\n- Residents owning a garden spade (S): 562\n\nEach resident owns a bag of candy hearts (C), so C is the universal set. We need to find the number of residents who own all four items (C, D, G, S).\n\nLet:\n- \\( h \\) = number of residents owning all four items.\n\nUsing the given data:\n1. The total number of residents is:\n   \\[\n   a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900\n   \\]\n   where \\( a \\) is the number of residents owning only C, \\( b, c, d \\) are those owning C and one other item, \\( e, f, g \\) own C and two others, and \\( h \\) owns all four.\n\n2. Residents owning exactly two items (C and one other):\n   \\[\n   b + c + d = 437\n   \\]\n\n3. Residents owning exactly three items (C and two others):\n   \\[\n   e + f + g = 234\n   \\]\n\nSubstituting into the total:\n\\[\na + (b + c + d) + (e + f + g) + h = 900\n\\]\n\\[\na + 437 + 234 + h = 900\n\\]\n\\[\na + h = 229\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the counts for D, G, and S:\n\\[\n|D| = b + e + f + h = 195\n\\]\n\\[\n|G| = c + e + g + h = 367\n\\]\n\\[\n|S| = d + f + g + h = 562\n\\]\n\nSumming these:\n\\[\n|D| + |G| + |S| = (b + e + f + h) + (c + e + g + h) + (d + f + g + h)\n\\]\n\\[\n195 + 367 + 562 = (b + c + d) + 2(e + f + g) + 3h\n\\]\n\\[\n1124 = 437 + 2(234) + 3h\n\\]\n\\[\n1124 = 905 + 3h\n\\]\n\\[\n3h = 219\n\\]\n\\[\nh = 73\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four items is \\(\\boxed{73}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nFirst, let me list out all the given information. There are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts, which is one thing. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 respectively. \n\nWait, so each resident owns at least the candy hearts, right? Because it says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, the candy hearts are a given for everyone. The other three items are optional. \n\nNow, the problem also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. Hmm, I'm trying to remember the inclusion-exclusion principle here. Because we're dealing with sets and their intersections.\n\nLet me recall the formula for four sets. But wait, actually, since everyone has the candy hearts, which is the fourth thing, maybe I should model this with four sets: A, B, C, D, where D is the set of people who own candy hearts. But since everyone owns D, the total number of people is 900, so D is 900.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's the fourth item. So, the four items are diamond ring (let's say set A), golf clubs (set B), garden spade (set C), and candy hearts (set D). But D is universal because everyone has it. So, the problem is about the other three sets, but D is always included.\n\nWait, maybe I should model the problem as the union of A, B, C, and D, but since D is everyone, the union of A, B, C, and D is just D, which is 900. But perhaps I should think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the problem as having four categories: the candy hearts (which everyone has), and the other three items. The problem is asking for the number of people who own all four, which is the intersection of A, B, C, and D. But since D is everyone, that's just the intersection of A, B, and C. So, the number of people who own all four is the same as the number who own all three of the other items.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if someone owns all four, they must own A, B, C, and D. But since D is everyone, it's the same as owning A, B, and C. So, the number of people who own all four is equal to the number of people who own all three of the first three items.\n\nHmm, but in the problem statement, they say that 234 residents own exactly three of these things. But wait, does that mean exactly three of the four, including the candy hearts? Because without the candy hearts, it's impossible, since everyone has the candy hearts. So, if someone owns exactly three things, they must have two of the first three (A, B, C) and the candy hearts. Or, perhaps, exactly three includes the candy hearts.\n\nWait, maybe I should clarify this. The problem states: \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, all 900 are in D. So, when it says 437 own exactly two of these things, does that mean exactly two of A, B, C, D? Because D is already given. Hmm, but it's a bit ambiguous. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\" The \"these things\" likely refers to the four items, including the candy hearts. Because the way it's phrased, it's after listing all four.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is written: \"Among the 900 residents... there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, the four items are the diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, when it says \"exactly two of these things,\" it refers to exactly two of the four.\n\nBut wait, since everyone owns the candy hearts, so if someone owns exactly two things, one of them must be the candy hearts, and the other is either a diamond ring, golf clubs, or garden spade. Similarly, someone owning exactly three things would have the candy hearts plus two of the other three, or all three of the other three plus the candy hearts. Wait, no. Wait, if someone owns exactly three of the four, they must have the candy hearts plus two of the other three.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again. If someone owns exactly three of the four, they can't have the candy hearts and two others, because that would be three. But since the candy hearts are a must, is it possible to have exactly three? Because if you have the candy hearts and two others, that's three. So, yes, the 234 who own exactly three must have the candy hearts plus two of A, B, C. So, in that case, the intersection of all four, which is A \u2229 B \u2229 C \u2229 D, is the same as A \u2229 B \u2229 C, since D is everyone.\n\nBut maybe I should model this using the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. But given that D is universal, maybe it's simpler.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can model the problem as having four sets, where D is the set of all 900. So, the total number of elements in the union of A, B, C, D is 900, since D is the entire population.\n\nBut the formula for the union of four sets is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |A \u2229 D| - |B \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 D| - |C \u2229 D| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 D| + |A \u2229 C \u2229 D| + |B \u2229 C \u2229 D| - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C \u2229 D|\n\nBut since D is everyone, |D|=900, and any intersection with D is just the other set. So, |A \u2229 D| = |A|, |B \u2229 D|=|B|, |C \u2229 D|=|C|, and similarly for intersections involving D.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I can find another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since all residents have D, the problem reduces to considering the other three sets A, B, C within the universe D. So, the problem is similar to having three sets within a universe of 900, and we can use inclusion-exclusion for three sets.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about four items, but since D is universal, perhaps I can model the problem as three sets (A, B, C) within a universe of 900, where the numbers of A, B, C are 195, 367, 562 respectively.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions the number of people who own exactly two of the four things. So, that would include owning two of A, B, C plus D. So, in the context of three sets A, B, C within D, the number of people owning exactly two of the four things would correspond to the number of people owning exactly one of A, B, C (since they must have D as well). Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three of the four would be those owning exactly two of A, B, C, plus D.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by considering that the four things include D (candy hearts) as a given. So, when we talk about the number of residents who own exactly two things, it's equivalent to owning one of A, B, C (since D is already included). Similarly, owning exactly three of the four would be owning two of A, B, C.\n\nSo, perhaps I should model the problem using the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets A, B, C, but considering that each person already has D.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- a = number of people who own A (diamond ring) = 195\n- b = number of people who own B (golf clubs) = 367\n- c = number of people who own C (garden spade) = 562\n- d = 900 (since everyone owns D)\n- e = number of people who own exactly two of the four things = 437\n- f = number of people who own exactly three of the four things = 234\n\nWait, but in terms of the three sets A, B, C, the number of people owning exactly two of the four would be the number of people owning exactly one of A, B, C, because D is always there. Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three of the four would be the number of people owning exactly two of A, B, C.\n\nBut wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nIf someone owns exactly two of the four things, since D is always owned, that means they own D and exactly one of A, B, or C. So, the number of people owning exactly two things (D plus one of A, B, C) is equal to the number of people owning exactly one of A, B, C.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three of the four things is equal to the number of people owning exactly two of A, B, C, because they have D plus two of the other three.\n\nAnd the number of people owning exactly four things is the number of people owning all three of A, B, C, since D is always included.\n\nSo, let me denote:\n\n- Let x be the number of people who own exactly one of A, B, C. Then, according to the problem, x equals the number of people who own exactly two of the four things, which is 437. So, x = 437.\n\n- Let y be the number of people who own exactly two of A, B, C. Then, according to the problem, y equals the number of people who own exactly three of the four things, which is 234. So, y = 234.\n\n- Let z be the number of people who own all three of A, B, C. Then, the number of people who own all four things is z, because they have A, B, C, and D.\n\nSo, the total number of people is the sum of people owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and none of A, B, C. But wait, no one owns none because everyone owns D, but not necessarily A, B, or C.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, but not necessarily any of the other three. So, the total number of residents is the sum of people who own:\n\n- Only D (but not A, B, C)\n- Exactly one of A, B, C plus D\n- Exactly two of A, B, C plus D\n- All three of A, B, C plus D\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\n- w = number of people who own only D (no A, B, C)\n- x = number of people who own D and exactly one of A, B, C (so exactly two things in total)\n- y = number of people who own D and exactly two of A, B, C (exactly three things)\n- z = number of people who own D and all three of A, B, C (exactly four things)\n\nThen, the total number of residents is:\n\nw + x + y + z = 900\n\nWe know that x = 437 and y = 234.\n\nSo, w + 437 + 234 + z = 900\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nw + z = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229\n\nSo, w + z = 229.\n\nNow, we need another equation to relate w and z. Let's think about the inclusion-exclusion principle for the three sets A, B, C.\n\nThe total number of people owning at least one of A, B, C is equal to the sum of the sizes of A, B, C minus the sum of their pairwise intersections plus the intersection of all three.\n\nBut also, the total number of people owning at least one of A, B, C is equal to (w + x + y + z) - w, because w are the people who don't own any of A, B, C. Wait, no, because w is the people who own only D. So, the number of people owning at least one of A, B, C is 900 - w.\n\nSo, using inclusion-exclusion for A, B, C:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = a + b + c - (|A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|) + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nBut |A \u222a B \u222a C| is equal to the number of people owning at least one of A, B, C, which is 900 - w.\n\nSo:\n\na + b + c - (|A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|) + |A\u2229B\u2229C| = 900 - w\n\nBut we also can express the number of people owning exactly two of A, B, C as y = 234, and exactly one as x = 437, and exactly three as z. \n\nWait, the number of people owning exactly two of A, B, C is equal to the sum of the pairwise intersections minus three times the triple intersection. Because each pairwise intersection includes those who are also in the triple intersection.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the number of people owning exactly two of A, B, C is:\n\n(|A\u2229B| - |A\u2229B\u2229C|) + (|A\u2229C| - |A\u2229B\u2229C|) + (|B\u2229C| - |A\u2229B\u2229C|) ) \n\nWhich is equal to (|A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|) - 3|A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nAnd this is equal to y = 234.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly one of A, B, C is:\n\n(|A| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|) + (|B| - |A\u2229B| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|) + (|C| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|) )\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, the number of people owning exactly one is equal to (a + b + c) - 2*(number of people owning exactly two) - 3*(number of people owning exactly three). Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, let's think in terms of the inclusion-exclusion formula. The total number of people in A, B, or C is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nWhich is equal to (number of people with exactly one) + 2*(number with exactly two) + 3*(number with exactly three).\n\nWait, let me explain. Because when you sum |A| + |B| + |C|, you're counting each person with exactly one set once, each person with exactly two sets twice (once in each set they belong to), and each person with exactly three sets three times (once in each set they belong to). Then, when you subtract the pairwise intersections, you subtract the people with exactly two sets twice (since each pairwise intersection includes them once), and subtract the people with exactly three sets three times. Then, adding back the triple intersection adds the people with exactly three sets once. So, overall:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = (x) + 2y + 3z - (y + 3z) + z = x + 2y + 3z - y -3z + z = x + y + z.\n\nWait, that might not be the right way to think about it. Alternatively, perhaps the total number of elements in A \u222a B \u222a C is equal to the number of people with exactly one, exactly two, or exactly three of A, B, C.\n\nSo, |A \u222a B \u222a C| = x + y + z.\n\nBut earlier, we have |A \u222a B \u222a C| = a + b + c - (|A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|) + |A\u2229B\u2229C|.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps we can express the sum a + b + c in terms of x, y, z.\n\nBecause:\n\na = number of people owning A (which includes those who own exactly A, those who own A and B, A and C, and all three).\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nSo, a = x_A + y_AB + y_AC + z\n\nSimilarly, b = x_B + y_AB + y_BC + z\n\nc = x_C + y_AC + y_BC + z\n\nWhere x_A is the number of people owning exactly A, x_B exactly B, x_C exactly C.\n\nBut the total number of people owning exactly one is x = x_A + x_B + x_C = 437.\n\nThe number of people owning exactly two is y = y_AB + y_AC + y_BC = 234.\n\nAnd the number of people owning exactly three is z.\n\nSo, summing a + b + c:\n\na + b + c = (x_A + x_B + x_C) + 2*(y_AB + y_AC + y_BC) + 3*z\n\nWhich is x + 2y + 3z.\n\nSo, a + b + c = x + 2y + 3z.\n\nWe know x=437, y=234, so a + b + c = 437 + 2*234 + 3z.\n\nCalculating that: 437 + 468 = 905, plus 3z. So, 905 + 3z.\n\nBut a + b + c is given as 195 + 367 + 562.\n\nLet me compute that: 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124.\n\nSo, 905 + 3z = 1124.\n\nSolving for z: 3z = 1124 - 905 = 219 \u2192 z = 73.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, z = 73. But earlier, we had w + z = 229.\n\nSo, w = 229 - z = 229 - 73 = 156.\n\nSo, the number of people who own all four things is z, which is 73.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWe have:\n\na + b + c = x + 2y + 3z\n\nSo, 195 + 367 + 562 = 437 + 2*234 + 3z.\n\nCalculating left side: 195+367=562, +562=1124.\n\nRight side: 437 + 468 = 905, +3z.\n\nSo, 905 + 3z = 1124 \u2192 3z=219 \u2192 z=73.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of people who own all four is z=73.\n\nBut wait, earlier, I thought that the number of people owning all four is the same as the number of people owning all three of A, B, C, which is z. So, yes, that matches.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 73.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nFirst, let me list out all the given information. There are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts, which is one thing. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 respectively. \n\nWait, so each resident owns at least the candy hearts, right? Because it says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, the candy hearts are a given for everyone. The other three items are optional. \n\nNow, the problem also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. Hmm, I'm trying to remember the inclusion-exclusion principle here. Because we're dealing with sets and their intersections.\n\nLet me recall the formula for four sets. But wait, actually, since everyone has the candy hearts, which is the fourth thing, maybe I should model this with four sets: A, B, C, D, where D is the set of people who own candy hearts. But since everyone owns D, the total number of people is 900, so D is 900.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's the fourth item. So, the four items are diamond ring (let's say set A), golf clubs (set B), garden spade (set C), and candy hearts (set D). But D is universal because everyone has it. So, the problem is about the other three sets, but D is always included.\n\nWait, maybe I should model the problem as the union of A, B, C, and D, but since D is everyone, the union of A, B, C, and D is just D, which is 900. But perhaps I should think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the problem as having four categories: the candy hearts (which everyone has), and the other three items. The problem is asking for the number of people who own all four, which is the intersection of A, B, C, and D. But since D is everyone, that's just the intersection of A, B, and C. So, the number of people who own all four is the same as the number who own all three of the other items.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if someone owns all four, they must own A, B, C, and D. But since D is everyone, it's the same as owning A, B, and C. So, the number of people who own all four is equal to the number of people who own all three of the first three items.\n\nHmm, but in the problem statement, they say that 234 residents own exactly three of these things. But wait, does that mean exactly three of the four, including the candy hearts? Because without the candy hearts, it's impossible, since everyone has the candy hearts. So, if someone owns exactly three things, they must have two of the first three (A, B, C) and the candy hearts. Or, perhaps, exactly three includes the candy hearts.\n\nWait, maybe I should clarify this. The problem states: \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, all 900 are in D. So, when it says 437 own exactly two of these things, does that mean exactly two of A, B, C, D? Because D is already given. Hmm, but it's a bit ambiguous. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\" The \"these things\" likely refers to the four items, including the candy hearts. Because the way it's phrased, it's after listing all four.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is written: \"Among the 900 residents... there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, the four items are the diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, when it says \"exactly two of these things,\" it refers to exactly two of the four.\n\nBut wait, since everyone owns the candy hearts, so if someone owns exactly two things, one of them must be the candy hearts, and the other is either a diamond ring, golf clubs, or garden spade. Similarly, someone owning exactly three things would have the candy hearts plus two of the other three, or all three of the other three plus the candy hearts. Wait, no. Wait, if someone owns exactly three of the four, they must have the candy hearts plus two of the other three.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again. If someone owns exactly three of the four, they can't have the candy hearts and two others, because that would be three. But since the candy hearts are a must, is it possible to have exactly three? Because if you have the candy hearts and two others, that's three. So, yes, the 234 who own exactly three must have the candy hearts plus two of A, B, C. So, in that case, the intersection of all four, which is A \u2229 B \u2229 C \u2229 D, is the same as A \u2229 B \u2229 C, since D is everyone.\n\nBut maybe I should model this using the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. But given that D is universal, maybe it's simpler.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can model the problem as having four sets, where D is the set of all 900. So, the total number of elements in the union of A, B, C, D is 900, since D is the entire population.\n\nBut the formula for the union of four sets is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |A \u2229 D| - |B \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 D| - |C \u2229 D| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 D| + |A \u2229 C \u2229 D| + |B \u2229 C \u2229 D| - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C \u2229 D|\n\nBut since D is everyone, |D|=900, and any intersection with D is just the other set. So, |A \u2229 D| = |A|, |B \u2229 D|=|B|, |C \u2229 D|=|C|, and similarly for intersections involving D.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I can find another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since all residents have D, the problem reduces to considering the other three sets A, B, C within the universe D. So, the problem is similar to having three sets within a universe of 900, and we can use inclusion-exclusion for three sets.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about four items, but since D is universal, perhaps I can model the problem as three sets (A, B, C) within a universe of 900, where the numbers of A, B, C are 195, 367, 562 respectively.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions the number of people who own exactly two of the four things. So, that would include owning two of A, B, C plus D. So, in the context of three sets A, B, C within D, the number of people owning exactly two of the four things would correspond to the number of people owning exactly one of A, B, C (since they must have D as well). Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three of the four would be those owning exactly two of A, B, C, plus D.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by considering that the four things include D (candy hearts) as a given. So, when we talk about the number of residents who own exactly two things, it's equivalent to owning one of A, B, C (since D is already included). Similarly, owning exactly three of the four would be owning two of A, B, C.\n\nSo, perhaps I should model the problem using the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets A, B, C, but considering that each person already has D.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- a = number of people who own A (diamond ring) = 195\n- b = number of people who own B (golf clubs) = 367\n- c = number of people who own C (garden spade) = 562\n- d = 900 (since everyone owns D)\n- e = number of people who own exactly two of the four things = 437\n- f = number of people who own exactly three of the four things = 234\n\nWait, but in terms of the three sets A, B, C, the number of people owning exactly two of the four would be the number of people owning exactly one of A, B, C, because D is always there. Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three of the four would be the number of people owning exactly two of A, B, C.\n\nBut wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nIf someone owns exactly two of the four things, since D is always owned, that means they own D and exactly one of A, B, or C. So, the number of people owning exactly two things (D plus one of A, B, C) is equal to the number of people owning exactly one of A, B, C.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three of the four things is equal to the number of people owning exactly two of A, B, C, because they have D plus two of the other three.\n\nAnd the number of people owning exactly four things is the number of people owning all three of A, B, C, since D is always included.\n\nSo, let me denote:\n\n- Let x be the number of people who own exactly one of A, B, C. Then, according to the problem, x equals the number of people who own exactly two of the four things, which is 437. So, x = 437.\n\n- Let y be the number of people who own exactly two of A, B, C. Then, according to the problem, y equals the number of people who own exactly three of the four things, which is 234. So, y = 234.\n\n- Let z be the number of people who own all three of A, B, C. Then, the number of people who own all four things is z, because they have A, B, C, and D.\n\nSo, the total number of people is the sum of people owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and none of A, B, C. But wait, no one owns none because everyone owns D, but not necessarily A, B, or C.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, but not necessarily any of the other three. So, the total number of residents is the sum of people who own:\n\n- Only D (but not A, B, C)\n- Exactly one of A, B, C plus D\n- Exactly two of A, B, C plus D\n- All three of A, B, C plus D\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\n- w = number of people who own only D (no A, B, C)\n- x = number of people who own D and exactly one of A, B, C (so exactly two things in total)\n- y = number of people who own D and exactly two of A, B, C (exactly three things)\n- z = number of people who own D and all three of A, B, C (exactly four things)\n\nThen, the total number of residents is:\n\nw + x + y + z = 900\n\nWe know that x = 437 and y = 234.\n\nSo, w + 437 + 234 + z = 900\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nw + z = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229\n\nSo, w + z = 229.\n\nNow, we need another equation to relate w and z. Let's think about the inclusion-exclusion principle for the three sets A, B, C.\n\nThe total number of people owning at least one of A, B, C is equal to the sum of the sizes of A, B, C minus the sum of their pairwise intersections plus the intersection of all three.\n\nBut also, the total number of people owning at least one of A, B, C is equal to (w + x + y + z) - w, because w are the people who don't own any of A, B, C. Wait, no, because w is the people who own only D. So, the number of people owning at least one of A, B, C is 900 - w.\n\nSo, using inclusion-exclusion for A, B, C:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = a + b + c - (|A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|) + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nBut |A \u222a B \u222a C| is equal to the number of people owning at least one of A, B, C, which is 900 - w.\n\nSo:\n\na + b + c - (|A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|) + |A\u2229B\u2229C| = 900 - w\n\nBut we also can express the number of people owning exactly two of A, B, C as y = 234, and exactly one as x = 437, and exactly three as z. \n\nWait, the number of people owning exactly two of A, B, C is equal to the sum of the pairwise intersections minus three times the triple intersection. Because each pairwise intersection includes those who are also in the triple intersection.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the number of people owning exactly two of A, B, C is:\n\n(|A\u2229B| - |A\u2229B\u2229C|) + (|A\u2229C| - |A\u2229B\u2229C|) + (|B\u2229C| - |A\u2229B\u2229C|) ) \n\nWhich is equal to (|A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|) - 3|A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nAnd this is equal to y = 234.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly one of A, B, C is:\n\n(|A| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|) + (|B| - |A\u2229B| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|) + (|C| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|) )\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, the number of people owning exactly one is equal to (a + b + c) - 2*(number of people owning exactly two) - 3*(number of people owning exactly three). Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, let's think in terms of the inclusion-exclusion formula. The total number of people in A, B, or C is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nWhich is equal to (number of people with exactly one) + 2*(number with exactly two) + 3*(number with exactly three).\n\nWait, let me explain. Because when you sum |A| + |B| + |C|, you're counting each person with exactly one set once, each person with exactly two sets twice (once in each set they belong to), and each person with exactly three sets three times (once in each set they belong to). Then, when you subtract the pairwise intersections, you subtract the people with exactly two sets twice (since each pairwise intersection includes them once), and subtract the people with exactly three sets three times. Then, adding back the triple intersection adds the people with exactly three sets once. So, overall:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = (x) + 2y + 3z - (y + 3z) + z = x + 2y + 3z - y -3z + z = x + y + z.\n\nWait, that might not be the right way to think about it. Alternatively, perhaps the total number of elements in A \u222a B \u222a C is equal to the number of people with exactly one, exactly two, or exactly three of A, B, C.\n\nSo, |A \u222a B \u222a C| = x + y + z.\n\nBut earlier, we have |A \u222a B \u222a C| = a + b + c - (|A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|) + |A\u2229B\u2229C|.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps we can express the sum a + b + c in terms of x, y, z.\n\nBecause:\n\na = number of people owning A (which includes those who own exactly A, those who own A and B, A and C, and all three).\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nSo, a = x_A + y_AB + y_AC + z\n\nSimilarly, b = x_B + y_AB + y_BC + z\n\nc = x_C + y_AC + y_BC + z\n\nWhere x_A is the number of people owning exactly A, x_B exactly B, x_C exactly C.\n\nBut the total number of people owning exactly one is x = x_A + x_B + x_C = 437.\n\nThe number of people owning exactly two is y = y_AB + y_AC + y_BC = 234.\n\nAnd the number of people owning exactly three is z.\n\nSo, summing a + b + c:\n\na + b + c = (x_A + x_B + x_C) + 2*(y_AB + y_AC + y_BC) + 3*z\n\nWhich is x + 2y + 3z.\n\nSo, a + b + c = x + 2y + 3z.\n\nWe know x=437, y=234, so a + b + c = 437 + 2*234 + 3z.\n\nCalculating that: 437 + 468 = 905, plus 3z. So, 905 + 3z.\n\nBut a + b + c is given as 195 + 367 + 562.\n\nLet me compute that: 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124.\n\nSo, 905 + 3z = 1124.\n\nSolving for z: 3z = 1124 - 905 = 219 \u2192 z = 73.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, z = 73. But earlier, we had w + z = 229.\n\nSo, w = 229 - z = 229 - 73 = 156.\n\nSo, the number of people who own all four things is z, which is 73.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWe have:\n\na + b + c = x + 2y + 3z\n\nSo, 195 + 367 + 562 = 437 + 2*234 + 3z.\n\nCalculating left side: 195+367=562, +562=1124.\n\nRight side: 437 + 468 = 905, +3z.\n\nSo, 905 + 3z = 1124 \u2192 3z=219 \u2192 z=73.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of people who own all four is z=73.\n\nBut wait, earlier, I thought that the number of people owning all four is the same as the number of people owning all three of A, B, C, which is z. So, yes, that matches.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 73.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the ownership of four items among 900 residents of Aimeville. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts (D), and some own a diamond ring (A), golf clubs (B), or garden spade (C). We are given:\n\n- |A| = 195, |B| = 367, |C| = 562\n- 437 residents own exactly two items (including D)\n- 234 residents own exactly three items (including D)\n\nSince every resident owns D, the problem reduces to analyzing the ownership of A, B, and C.

The total number of residents is:\n\nw (owning only D) + x + y + z = 900\n\nThus, w + z = 900 - x - y = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229.\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle for A, B, and C:\n\n|A| + |B| + |C| = x + 2y + 3z\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n195 + 367 + 562 = 437 + 2(234) + 3z\n\n1124 = 437 + 468 + 3z\n\n1124 = 905 + 3z\n\n3z = 219 \u2192 z = 73.\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four items is z = 73.\n\n$\\boxed{73}$",

The question is asking how many own all four things\u2014so that's the candy hearts plus the other three.\n\nHmm, this seems like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by considering their intersections. Since we have four things (including the candy hearts), but the other three are the ones with given counts, I think I need to model this with four sets.\n\nWait, but all residents own the candy hearts. So that's like a universal set here. So maybe the problem can be reframed in terms of the three other items, with the candy hearts being something everyone has.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the sets as follows:\n- Let D be the set of residents who own a diamond ring.\n- Let G be those who own a set of golf clubs.\n- Let S be those who own a garden spade.\n- Let C be those who own candy hearts, which is everyone, so |C|=900.\n\nWe're looking for the number of residents who own all four, which would be |D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C|. But since C is everyone, this is just |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|.\n\nWait, but maybe I should model this differently. Since C is universal, any intersection with C doesn't change the set. So, perhaps we can ignore C for the purpose of calculating overlaps between D, G, and S, because owning all four is the same as owning D, G, and S.\n\nBut wait, the problem gives information about residents owning exactly two or exactly three of these things. So maybe we need to consider all four items, including the candy hearts. Because someone could own exactly two of the four, including the candy hearts, or exactly three, again including the candy hearts.\n\nWait a minute, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to break it down.\n\nEach resident owns the candy hearts, so the four items are C (candy hearts), D, G, S.\n\nBut the counts given for D, G, S are 195, 367, 562. The problem also states that 437 own exactly two of these four, and 234 own exactly three.\n\nWait, no. The problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So C is a given, so the other three items are D, G, S. So the residents can own some combination of D, G, S, plus C. But since C is already owned by everyone, the 'exactly two' and 'exactly three' counts are referring to the number of the other three items, not including C.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, when the problem says 437 residents own exactly two of these things, it's referring to exactly two of D, G, S. Similarly, 234 own exactly three of D, G, S. So the 'all four' would be those who own D, G, S, and C. But since C is already included, it's just the same as owning D, G, S.\n\nSo, in that case, the number of residents who own all four is the same as those who own D, G, and S.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The problem says: \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So, the four things are C, D, G, S. So, when the problem says \"437 residents own exactly two of these things,\" it's referring to exactly two of the four, including C? Or not?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\"\n\nHmm, so 'these things' probably refers to the four items. Because earlier, the problem lists four things: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, each resident owns at least the candy hearts.\n\nSo, the counts of exactly two and exactly three are referring to the four items. So, someone who owns exactly two of the four could be, for example, candy hearts and a diamond ring, but not the others. Similarly, someone who owns exactly three could have candy hearts and two others.\n\nWait, but since everyone has candy hearts, the number of residents who own exactly two of the four would be the number of people who have candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three. Similarly, those who own exactly three would have candy hearts plus two of the other three.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the four items are C, D, G, S. Each resident owns at least C. So, the counts for D, G, S are 195, 367, 562, but when considering all four, the overlaps might include C.\n\nBut let's clarify. The problem says:\n\n- 195 own a diamond ring\n- 367 own a set of golf clubs\n- 562 own a garden spade\n- All own a bag of candy hearts.\n\nSo, the four 'things' are C, D, G, S. So, when the problem mentions \"exactly two of these things,\" it's referring to any two of the four. But since C is universal, it's possible that someone has C plus one of D, G, S, making it exactly two things.\n\nWait, but if someone has exactly two of the four, they could have C plus one of the others, or maybe two of D, G, S without C? But no, because C is a given. So, if you own exactly two, you must have C plus exactly one of the others. Similarly, exactly three would be C plus two of the others, and exactly four would be all four, which is C, D, G, S.\n\nSo, with that in mind, the problem gives us:\n\n- Exactly two of four: 437\n- Exactly three of four: 234\n\nAnd we need to find the number who own all four, which is exactly four.\n\nSo, to model this, perhaps we can use inclusion-exclusion for four sets. But since C is universal, maybe that can simplify things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the problem in terms of the three items D, G, S, since C is already owned by everyone.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me consider that the problem is about three sets (D, G, S) within a universe of 900. But since everyone owns C, the number of people who own exactly two of the four is the same as the number of people who own exactly one of D, G, S, because they have C plus one other.\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me think.\n\nIf someone owns exactly two of the four things, and since C is always included, that would mean they own C and exactly one of D, G, or S. So, the number of people owning exactly two is equal to the number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three of the four is the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S.\n\nAnd the number of people owning exactly four is the number of people owning all three of D, G, S.\n\nSo, in this case, the 437 who own exactly two of the four are the same as the number of people who own exactly one of D, G, S.\n\nThe 234 who own exactly three of the four are the same as the number of people who own exactly two of D, G, S.\n\nAnd the number of people who own all four (C, D, G, S) is the same as the number of people who own all three of D, G, S, which is what we're looking for.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, to model this, let me define:\n\nLet a = number of people who own exactly 0 of D, G, S (but they must own C, so exactly one thing)\nWait, no, because everyone owns C, so the minimum number of things someone owns is one (C). So, the possible number of things someone can own is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nBut the problem says 437 own exactly two of the four things, which is C plus one other. So, exactly one of D, G, S. Similarly, 234 own exactly three of the four, which is C plus two others.\n\nSo, the number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S is 437.\n\nThe number owning exactly two of D, G, S is 234.\n\nThe number owning exactly three of D, G, S is the number we're trying to find, which is the same as the number owning all four things.\n\nSo, let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- n0: number of people owning exactly 0 of D, G, S. But since everyone owns C, n0 is 0, because everyone has at least C, which is one thing.\n\n- n1: number of people owning exactly 1 of D, G, S. This is given as 437.\n\n- n2: number owning exactly 2 of D, G, S. Given as 234.\n\n- n3: number owning exactly 3 of D, G, S. This is what we're trying to find, which is the same as the number of people owning all four things.\n\nSince all 900 residents are accounted for, we have:\n\nn0 + n1 + n2 + n3 = 900.\n\nBut since n0 is 0, that equation becomes:\n\n437 + 234 + n3 = 900.\n\nWait, 437 + 234 is 671. So 671 + n3 = 900. Therefore, n3 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nWait, so the number of people who own all four things is 229?\n\nBut wait, let me check if this makes sense. Because if n3 is 229, then the number of people owning all three of D, G, S is 229, which is the same as the number owning all four things.\n\nBut let me make sure that this aligns with the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nWait, another approach: The inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets D, G, S.\n\nThe total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|.\n\nBut since everyone owns C, the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to the number of people owning at least one of the four things minus the number owning exactly C.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is the same as the number of people owning more than one thing (including C). Because everyone owns C, so if someone owns D, G, or S, they're owning at least two things: C and one of the others.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this using the inclusion-exclusion for the three sets D, G, S, but considering that the universal set is 900.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nThe total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to |D \u222a G \u222a S|.\n\nBut since everyone owns C, the number of people not owning D, G, or S is n0, which is 0 because everyone owns C. Wait, no, n0 is the number who own exactly C, which is zero because each resident owns C plus at least one other thing? Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so n0 is the number of people owning only C, which is possible. So, n0 could be non-zero.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the problem, each resident owns at least C. So, they can own exactly C, or C plus one, two, or three of the other items.\n\nBut the problem gives us the number of people owning exactly two or exactly three of the four items.\n\nWait, exactly two of the four items would mean C plus exactly one other. So, that's n1 = 437.\n\nExactly three of the four items would be C plus exactly two others. So, that's n2 = 234.\n\nExactly four items would be C plus all three others, which is n3, the number we're trying to find.\n\nAnd the remaining people would own exactly one thing, which is C only. So, n0.\n\nSo, total residents: n0 + n1 + n2 + n3 = 900.\n\nWe know n1 =437, n2=234.\n\nSo, n0 + 437 + 234 + n3 = 900.\n\nSo, n0 + n3 = 900 - (437+234) = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nBut we don't know n0 or n3 yet.\n\nBut we can find |D|, |G|, |S| in terms of n1, n2, n3.\n\nLet me think. The total number of people owning D is 195. This includes all people who own D in any combination: those who own only D (which is part of n0, but wait no, n0 owns only C, so if someone owns D, they must own C plus D, so they would be in n1 or higher.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the number of people owning D is equal to the number of people who own exactly D and C (n1 for D) plus those who own D and another item (n2 for D) plus those who own all three (n3).\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nWait, but how does that work?\n\nWait, let me define:\n\n- Let a = number of people owning exactly D and C (so exactly two things: C and D). This would be part of n1.\n\n- Similarly, b = exactly G and C.\n\n- c = exactly S and C.\n\n- Then, the number of people owning exactly two things (C and one other) would be a + b + c = 437.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because n1 is 437, which is the number of people owning exactly two of the four things, which are C and one other. So, a + b + c = 437.\n\nNow, for the number of people owning exactly three things, which is n2 = 234. These would be the people who own C plus two of the other three. So, let me denote:\n\n- d = number of people owning C, D, and G.\n\n- e = number owning C, D, and S.\n\n- f = number owning C, G, and S.\n\nSo, d + e + f = 234.\n\nAnd the number of people owning all four things, which is C, D, G, S, is n3.\n\nNow, let's express |D|, |G|, |S| in terms of these variables.\n\nThe total number of people owning D is the sum of those who own exactly D and C (a), those who own D, C, and one other (d, e), and those who own all four (n3).\n\nSo:\n\n|D| = a + d + e + n3 = 195.\n\nSimilarly, |G| = b + d + f + n3 = 367.\n\n|S| = c + e + f + n3 = 562.\n\nWe also have:\n\na + b + c = 437 (since these are the people owning exactly two things: C and one other).\n\nd + e + f = 234 (since these are the people owning exactly three things: C and two others).\n\nAnd n3 is the number of people owning all four.\n\nAdditionally, n0 + a + b + c + d + e + f + n3 = 900.\n\nBut n0 is the number of people owning only C, so they are the remaining.\n\nWait, but we don't know n0 yet.\n\nLet me write down all the equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = 437.\n\n2. d + e + f = 234.\n\n3. |D| = a + d + e + n3 = 195.\n\n4. |G| = b + d + f + n3 = 367.\n\n5. |S| = c + e + f + n3 = 562.\n\n6. n0 + 437 + 234 + n3 = 900 \u2192 n0 + n3 = 229.\n\nSo, we have five equations (1-5) and variables a, b, c, d, e, f, n3, and n0. But we can perhaps find a way to express everything in terms of n3 and solve.\n\nLet me think. Let's sum the equations for |D|, |G|, and |S|.\n\nAdding equations 3,4,5:\n\n(a + d + e + n3) + (b + d + f + n3) + (c + e + f + n3) = 195 + 367 + 562.\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\na + b + c + (d + d) + (e + e) + (f + f) + 3n3.\n\nWhich is (a + b + c) + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3n3.\n\nFrom equations 1 and 2, we know a + b + c = 437 and d + e + f = 234.\n\nSo substitute:\n\n437 + 2*(d + e + f) + 3n3 = 195 + 367 + 562.\n\nCompute the sum on the right: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSo, left side: 437 + 2*234 + 3n3.\n\nCompute 2*234 = 468.\n\nSo, 437 + 468 = 905.\n\nSo, 905 + 3n3 = 1124.\n\nSubtract 905: 3n3 = 1124 - 905 = 219.\n\nSo, n3 = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, n3 is 73.\n\nBut wait, let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSum of |D|, |G|, |S| is 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSum of (a + d + e + n3) + (b + d + f + n3) + (c + e + f + n3) = a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3n3.\n\nWhich is (a + b + c) + 2*(d + e + f) + 3n3.\n\nWe have a + b + c = 437, d + e + f = 234.\n\nSo, 437 + 2*234 + 3n3 = 437 + 468 + 3n3 = 905 + 3n3.\n\nSet equal to 1124:\n\n905 + 3n3 = 1124 \u2192 3n3 = 219 \u2192 n3=73.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about n0 + n3 = 229, if n3 is 73, then n0 would be 229 - 73 = 156. So, 156 people own only C, and no other items.\n\nThat seems plausible.\n\nLet me just verify with the individual equations.\n\nLet me take equation 3: a + d + e + n3 = 195.\n\nWe know n3 is 73, so a + d + e = 195 - 73 = 122.\n\nSimilarly, equation 4: b + d + f + 73 = 367 \u2192 b + d + f = 294.\n\nEquation 5: c + e + f +73 = 562 \u2192 c + e + f = 489.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nFrom equation 1: a + b + c = 437.\n\nFrom equation 2: d + e + f = 234.\n\nLet me see if I can find a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\nBut maybe I don't need to, since the question only asks for n3, which is 73.\n\nSo, the answer should be 73.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the given data systematically. \n\nWe are given:\n- Total residents: 900.\n- Residents owning a diamond ring (D): 195.\n- Residents owning golf clubs (G): 367.\n- Residents owning a garden spade (S): 562.\n- All residents own candy hearts (C).\n- Residents owning exactly two of the four items: 437.\n- Residents owning exactly three of the four items: 234.\n\nSince everyone owns C, the counts of exactly two and exactly three refer to combinations including C.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to parse it step by step. \n\nFirst, the total number of residents is 900. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's one thing everyone has. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers given are 195 owning a diamond ring, 367 owning golf clubs, and 562 owning a garden spade. \n\nAlso, some residents own exactly two of these things, and some own exactly three. Specifically, 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking how many own all four things\u2014so that's the candy hearts plus the other three.\n\nHmm, this seems like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by considering their intersections. Since we have four things (including the candy hearts), but the other three are the ones with given counts, I think I need to model this with four sets.\n\nWait, but all residents own the candy hearts. So that's like a universal set here. So maybe the problem can be reframed in terms of the three other items, with the candy hearts being something everyone has.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the sets as follows:\n- Let D be the set of residents who own a diamond ring.\n- Let G be those who own a set of golf clubs.\n- Let S be those who own a garden spade.\n- Let C be those who own candy hearts, which is everyone, so |C|=900.\n\nWe're looking for the number of residents who own all four, which would be |D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C|. But since C is everyone, this is just |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|.\n\nWait, but maybe I should model this differently. Since C is universal, any intersection with C doesn't change the set. So, perhaps we can ignore C for the purpose of calculating overlaps between D, G, and S, because owning all four is the same as owning D, G, and S.\n\nBut wait, the problem gives information about residents owning exactly two or exactly three of these things. So maybe we need to consider all four items, including the candy hearts. Because someone could own exactly two of the four, including the candy hearts, or exactly three, again including the candy hearts.\n\nWait a minute, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to break it down.\n\nEach resident owns the candy hearts, so the four items are C (candy hearts), D, G, S.\n\nBut the counts given for D, G, S are 195, 367, 562. The problem also states that 437 own exactly two of these four, and 234 own exactly three.\n\nWait, no. The problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So C is a given, so the other three items are D, G, S. So the residents can own some combination of D, G, S, plus C. But since C is already owned by everyone, the 'exactly two' and 'exactly three' counts are referring to the number of the other three items, not including C.\n\nWait, that makes sense.

Because earlier, the problem lists four things: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, each resident owns at least the candy hearts.\n\nSo, the counts of exactly two and exactly three are referring to the four items. So, someone who owns exactly two of the four could be, for example, candy hearts and a diamond ring, but not the others. Similarly, someone who owns exactly three could have candy hearts and two others.\n\nWait, but since everyone has candy hearts, the number of residents who own exactly two of the four would be the number of people who have candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three. Similarly, those who own exactly three would have candy hearts plus two of the other three.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the four items are C, D, G, S. Each resident owns at least C. So, the counts for D, G, S are 195, 367, 562, but when considering all four, the overlaps might include C.\n\nBut let's clarify. The problem says:\n\n- 195 own a diamond ring\n- 367 own a set of golf clubs\n- 562 own a garden spade\n- All own a bag of candy hearts.\n\nSo, the four 'things' are C, D, G, S.

Let me think.\n\nIf someone owns exactly two of the four things, and since C is always included, that would mean they own C and exactly one of D, G, or S. So, the number of people owning exactly two is equal to the number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three of the four is the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S.\n\nAnd the number of people owning exactly four is the number of people owning all three of D, G, S.\n\nSo, in this case, the 437 who own exactly two of the four are the same as the number of people who own exactly one of D, G, S.\n\nThe 234 who own exactly three of the four are the same as the number of people who own exactly two of D, G, S.\n\nAnd the number of people who own all four (C, D, G, S) is the same as the number of people who own all three of D, G, S, which is what we're looking for.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, to model this, let me define:\n\nLet a = number of people who own exactly 0 of D, G, S (but they must own C, so exactly one thing)\nWait, no, because everyone owns C, so the minimum number of things someone owns is one (C). So, the possible number of things someone can own is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nBut the problem says 437 own exactly two of the four things, which is C plus one other. So, exactly one of D, G, S. Similarly, 234 own exactly three of the four, which is C plus two others.\n\nSo, the number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S is 437.\n\nThe number owning exactly two of D, G, S is 234.\n\nThe number owning exactly three of D, G, S is the number we're trying to find, which is the same as the number owning all four things.\n\nSo, let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- n0: number of people owning exactly 0 of D, G, S. But since everyone owns C, n0 is 0, because everyone has at least C, which is one thing.\n\n- n1: number of people owning exactly 1 of D, G, S. This is given as 437.\n\n- n2: number owning exactly 2 of D, G, S. Given as 234.\n\n- n3: number owning exactly 3 of D, G, S. This is what we're trying to find, which is the same as the number of people owning all four things.\n\nSince all 900 residents are accounted for, we have:\n\nn0 + n1 + n2 + n3 = 900.\n\nBut since n0 is 0, that equation becomes:\n\n437 + 234 + n3 = 900.\n\nWait, 437 + 234 is 671. So 671 + n3 = 900. Therefore, n3 = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nWait, so the number of people who own all four things is 229?\n\nBut wait, let me check if this makes sense. Because if n3 is 229, then the number of people owning all three of D, G, S is 229, which is the same as the number owning all four things.\n\nBut let me make sure that this aligns with the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nWait, another approach: The inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets D, G, S.\n\nThe total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|.\n\nBut since everyone owns C, the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to the number of people owning at least one of the four things minus the number owning exactly C.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is the same as the number of people owning more than one thing (including C). Because everyone owns C, so if someone owns D, G, or S, they're owning at least two things: C and one of the others.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this using the inclusion-exclusion for the three sets D, G, S, but considering that the universal set is 900.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nThe total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to |D \u222a G \u222a S|.\n\nBut since everyone owns C, the number of people not owning D, G, or S is n0, which is 0 because everyone owns C. Wait, no, n0 is the number who own exactly C, which is zero because each resident owns C plus at least one other thing? Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so n0 is the number of people owning only C, which is possible. So, n0 could be non-zero.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the problem, each resident owns at least C. So, they can own exactly C, or C plus one, two, or three of the other items.\n\nBut the problem gives us the number of people owning exactly two or exactly three of the four items.\n\nWait, exactly two of the four items would mean C plus exactly one other. So, that's n1 = 437.\n\nExactly three of the four items would be C plus exactly two others. So, that's n2 = 234.\n\nExactly four items would be C plus all three others, which is n3, the number we're trying to find.\n\nAnd the remaining people would own exactly one thing, which is C only. So, n0.\n\nSo, total residents: n0 + n1 + n2 + n3 = 900.\n\nWe know n1 =437, n2=234.\n\nSo, n0 + 437 + 234 + n3 = 900.\n\nSo, n0 + n3 = 900 - (437+234) = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nBut we don't know n0 or n3 yet.\n\nBut we can find |D|, |G|, |S| in terms of n1, n2, n3.\n\nLet me think. The total number of people owning D is 195. This includes all people who own D in any combination: those who own only D (which is part of n0, but wait no, n0 owns only C, so if someone owns D, they must own C plus D, so they would be in n1 or higher.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the number of people owning D is equal to the number of people who own exactly D and C (n1 for D) plus those who own D and another item (n2 for D) plus those who own all three (n3).\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nWait, but how does that work?\n\nWait, let me define:\n\n- Let a = number of people owning exactly D and C (so exactly two things: C and D). This would be part of n1.\n\n- Similarly, b = exactly G and C.\n\n- c = exactly S and C.\n\n- Then, the number of people owning exactly two things (C and one other) would be a + b + c = 437.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because n1 is 437, which is the number of people owning exactly two of the four things, which are C and one other. So, a + b + c = 437.\n\nNow, for the number of people owning exactly three things, which is n2 = 234. These would be the people who own C plus two of the other three. So, let me denote:\n\n- d = number of people owning C, D, and G.\n\n- e = number owning C, D, and S.\n\n- f = number owning C, G, and S.\n\nSo, d + e + f = 234.\n\nAnd the number of people owning all four things, which is C, D, G, S, is n3.\n\nNow, let's express |D|, |G|, |S| in terms of these variables.\n\nThe total number of people owning D is the sum of those who own exactly D and C (a), those who own D, C, and one other (d, e), and those who own all four (n3).\n\nSo:\n\n|D| = a + d + e + n3 = 195.\n\nSimilarly, |G| = b + d + f + n3 = 367.\n\n|S| = c + e + f + n3 = 562.\n\nWe also have:\n\na + b + c = 437 (since these are the people owning exactly two things: C and one other).\n\nd + e + f = 234 (since these are the people owning exactly three things: C and two others).\n\nAnd n3 is the number of people owning all four.\n\nAdditionally, n0 + a + b + c + d + e + f + n3 = 900.\n\nBut n0 is the number of people owning only C, so they are the remaining.\n\nWait, but we don't know n0 yet.\n\nLet me write down all the equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = 437.\n\n2. d + e + f = 234.\n\n3. |D| = a + d + e + n3 = 195.\n\n4. |G| = b + d + f + n3 = 367.\n\n5. |S| = c + e + f + n3 = 562.\n\n6. n0 + 437 + 234 + n3 = 900 \u2192 n0 + n3 = 229.\n\nSo, we have five equations (1-5) and variables a, b, c, d, e, f, n3, and n0. But we can perhaps find a way to express everything in terms of n3 and solve.\n\nLet me think. Let's sum the equations for |D|, |G|, and |S|.\n\nAdding equations 3,4,5:\n\n(a + d + e + n3) + (b + d + f + n3) + (c + e + f + n3) = 195 + 367 + 562.\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\na + b + c + (d + d) + (e + e) + (f + f) + 3n3.\n\nWhich is (a + b + c) + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3n3.\n\nFrom equations 1 and 2, we know a + b + c = 437 and d + e + f = 234.\n\nSo substitute:\n\n437 + 2*(d + e + f) + 3n3 = 195 + 367 + 562.\n\nCompute the sum on the right: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSo, left side: 437 + 2*234 + 3n3.\n\nCompute 2*234 = 468.\n\nSo, 437 + 468 = 905.\n\nSo, 905 + 3n3 = 1124.\n\nSubtract 905: 3n3 = 1124 - 905 = 219.\n\nSo, n3 = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, n3 is 73.\n\nBut wait, let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSum of |D|, |G|, |S| is 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSum of (a + d + e + n3) + (b + d + f + n3) + (c + e + f + n3) = a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3n3.\n\nWhich is (a + b + c) + 2*(d + e + f) + 3n3.\n\nWe have a + b + c = 437, d + e + f = 234.\n\nSo, 437 + 2*234 + 3n3 = 437 + 468 + 3n3 = 905 + 3n3.\n\nSet equal to 1124:\n\n905 + 3n3 = 1124 \u2192 3n3 = 219 \u2192 n3=73.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about n0 + n3 = 229, if n3 is 73, then n0 would be 229 - 73 = 156. So, 156 people own only C, and no other items.\n\nThat seems plausible.\n\nLet me just verify with the individual equations.\n\nLet me take equation 3: a + d + e + n3 = 195.\n\nWe know n3 is 73, so a + d + e = 195 - 73 = 122.\n\nSimilarly, equation 4: b + d + f + 73 = 367 \u2192 b + d + f = 294.\n\nEquation 5: c + e + f +73 = 562 \u2192 c + e + f = 489.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nFrom equation 1: a + b + c = 437.\n\nFrom equation 2: d + e + f = 234.\n\nLet me see if I can find a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\nBut maybe I don't need to, since the question only asks for n3, which is 73.\n\nSo, the answer should be 73.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the given data systematically. \n\nWe are given:\n- Total residents: 900.\n- Residents owning a diamond ring (D): 195.\n- Residents owning golf clubs (G): 367.\n- Residents owning a garden spade (S): 562.\n- All residents own candy hearts (C).\n- Residents owning exactly two of the four items: 437.\n- Residents owning exactly three of the four items: 234.\n\nSince everyone owns C, the counts of exactly two and exactly three refer to combinations including C. We denote:\n- \\( n_1 \\): Number of residents owning exactly one of D, G, S (i.e., C plus one other).\n- \\( n_2 \\): Number of residents owning exactly two of D, G, S (i.e., C plus two others).\n- \\( n_3 \\): Number of residents owning all three of D, G, S (i.e., all four items).\n\nFrom the problem:\n- \\( n_1 = 437 \\),\n- \\( n_2 = 234 \\),\n- Total residents: \\( n_0 + n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 900 \\), where \\( n_0 \\) is the number of residents owning only C.\n\nWe calculate:\n\\[\nn_0 + 437 + 234 + n_3 = 900 \\implies n_0 + n_3 = 229.\n\\]\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle for sets D, G, and S:\n\\[\n|D| + |G| + |S| = a + d + e + n_3 + b + d + f + n_3 + c + e + f + n_3,\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\( a, b, c \\): Residents owning exactly C and one other item (part of \\( n_1 \\)).\n- \\( d, e, f \\): Residents owning exactly C and two others (part of \\( n_2 \\)).\n\nSubstituting known values:\n\\[\n195 + 367 + 562 = 437 + 2 \\times 234 + 3n_3 \\implies 1124 = 905 + 3n_3 \\implies 3n_3 = 219 \\implies n_3 = 73.\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four items is **73**.\n\n\\boxed{73}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about the residents of Aimeville. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem is about sets and their overlaps, right? So, it's a classic inclusion-exclusion principle problem.\n\nAlright, let's jot down the given information:\n\nTotal residents: 900.\n\nNumber of residents owning each item:\n- Diamond ring (D): 195\n- Golf clubs (G): 367\n- Garden spade (S): 562\n- Bag of candy hearts (H): Well, it says each of the 900 owns this, so H is 900.\n\nNow, other details:\n- 437 residents own exactly two of these things.\n- 234 residents own exactly three of these things.\n- We need to find the number who own all four, which is the intersection of D, G, S, and H.\n\nWait a minute, each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, H is universal; everyone has it. That might simplify things because H is 900, and all other sets are subsets of H.\n\nLet me think about how inclusion-exclusion works here. Normally, for four sets, the formula is:\n\nTotal = |D| + |G| + |S| + |H| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| - |D\u2229H| - |G\u2229H| - |S\u2229H| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229H| + |D\u2229S\u2229H| + |G\u2229S\u2229H| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229H|\n\nBut wait, since H is 900 and everyone owns it, the intersections involving H might be easier. Because any intersection with H is just the set itself. For example, D\u2229H is just D, since all D owners also have H. Similarly, G\u2229H is G, S\u2229H is S. So that might simplify some terms.\n\nBut let's see. Wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about the intersections directly, but it gives the number of people owning exactly two and exactly three things. So maybe we can model this with the inclusion-exclusion principle by considering the counts of exactly two and exactly three overlaps.\n\nLet me recall that the formula for the union of four sets is:\n\nTotal = sum of individual sets - sum of all pairwise intersections + sum of all triple intersections - quadruple intersection.\n\nBut since H is everyone, I can think about the other sets in relation to H. Let's denote U as the universal set with |U| = 900.\n\nSo, D, G, S are subsets of U. So, the union of D, G, S, and H is just U, because H is the entire set. So, the union of D, G, S is a subset of U.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking about how many own all four, which is D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229H. But since H is everyone, that's the same as D\u2229G\u2229S. So, the number of people who own all four is the same as the number who own all three of D, G, S.\n\nHmm, that might be a useful point. So, the quadruple intersection is equal to the triple intersection of D, G, and S.\n\nBut let's see. The problem says 437 own exactly two things, and 234 own exactly three. So, the total number of people owning two or three things is 437 + 234 = 671.\n\nBut wait, the total number of people is 900, and everyone owns at least H. So, the rest must be people who own only H, right? Because they don't own any of D, G, or S. So, the number of people who own only H is 900 - (number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S). Wait, but actually, since everyone owns H, the people who own only H are those who don't own D, G, or S.\n\nSo, let's denote the number of people owning only H as x. Then, the rest, 900 - x, own at least one of D, G, or S. But according to the problem, 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. So, the number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S is 437 + 234 + (number owning exactly one). Wait, no, actually, that's not correct.\n\nWait, the total number of people owning exactly two is 437, exactly three is 234, and exactly one is something we might need to compute. Also, people could own all four, but as I thought earlier, since H is universal, owning all four is the same as owning D, G, S.\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\n- Exactly two: 437\n- Exactly three: 234\n- Exactly four: let's call this y. But since H is included in all, y is the same as the number owning D, G, S, which is the triple intersection.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the number who own all four, which is y. So, if I can find y, that's the answer.\n\nBut how? Let's think about the inclusion-exclusion for three sets D, G, S. Because H is universal, the four-set problem reduces to the three-set problem for D, G, S.\n\nSo, the formula for three sets is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nBut we also know that the number of people owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and none of D, G, S are in the universal set.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\na = number owning exactly one of D, G, S\nb = number owning exactly two of D, G, S\nc = number owning exactly three of D, G, S\nd = number owning none of D, G, S\n\nSo, from the problem, b = 437, c = 234. But wait, no. Wait, the problem says 437 own exactly two of these things, which could include H. Wait, that's a complication because H is also a thing. So, when the problem says exactly two, it could be any two of the four: D, G, S, H.\n\nOh, right! I think I messed up earlier. Because the four things are D, G, S, H. So, the residents can own any combination of these four, including H. So, the counts of exactly two and exactly three include combinations with H.\n\nOh, that changes things. So, the problem is more complex because H is one of the four things. So, someone could own exactly two things, which might include H, or exactly three, which might include H.\n\nSo, I need to model all four sets, not just three. Hmm, this complicates things, but perhaps we can manage.\n\nWait, but H is owned by everyone. So, when someone owns exactly two things, it must include H. Because if they own two things, and H is one of them, since they all have H. Wait, no. Because H is not optional; everyone owns H. So, if someone owns exactly two things, it must be H plus one other. Similarly, someone who owns exactly three things must have H plus two others. And someone who owns all four must have H plus the other three.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if someone owns exactly two, since H is mandatory, they must have H and one more. Similarly, exactly three would be H plus two more. Exactly four would be H plus all three.\n\nSo, that changes the way we model the problem. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Exactly two things: These must include H and exactly one other item. So, the count for exactly two is the sum of people owning H and D only, H and G only, H and S only.\n\n- Exactly three things: These must include H and exactly two others. So, the count is the sum of people owning H, D, G; H, D, S; and H, G, S.\n\n- Exactly four things: These would be H, D, G, S. Which is the intersection of all four, which is the same as D \u2229 G \u2229 S because H is universal.\n\nWait, so the problem states that 437 own exactly two things. So, each of these 437 owns H and exactly one other item.\n\nSimilarly, 234 own exactly three things, which means they own H and exactly two others.\n\nSo, let's define some variables:\n\nLet x be the number of people who own exactly H and D (and nothing else). Similarly, y for H and G, z for H and S.\n\nSimilarly, a for exactly H, D, G; b for H, D, S; c for H, G, S.\n\nAnd d for exactly all four: H, D, G, S. So, d is the number we need to find.\n\nThen, the counts are:\n\nExactly two: x + y + z = 437.\n\nExactly three: a + b + c = 234.\n\nExactly four: d.\n\nBut wait, no. Because exactly two is H plus one other, so x, y, z are the counts for exactly two.\n\nExactly three is H plus two others, so a, b, c are the counts for exactly three.\n\nExactly four is H plus all three, which is d.\n\nAnd the rest own only H, which is the remaining people: 900 - (x + y + z + a + b + c + d).\n\nBut wait, let's write down the total number of people as:\n\nOnly H: let's denote this as w.\n\nSo, w + x + y + z + a + b + c + d = 900.\n\nBut according to the problem, the number of people owning exactly two is 437, which is x + y + z = 437.\n\nExactly three is 234, which is a + b + c = 234.\n\nAnd the number owning exactly four is d.\n\nSo, the remaining people, 900 - (437 + 234 + d) = w.\n\nSo, w = 900 - 437 - 234 - d.\n\nWhich is w = 900 - 671 - d = 229 - d.\n\nBut I don't know w yet. So, perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion for the three sets D, G, S, considering that H is universal.\n\nWait, but H is part of the four sets. So, perhaps I should model all four sets.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of the counts for each set.\n\nEach set includes H, so:\n\n- |D| = number of people owning D. Since everyone owns H, |D| is the number who own D and H, regardless of other items. So, |D| = x + a + b + d.\n\nSimilarly, |G| = y + a + c + d.\n\n|S| = z + b + c + d.\n\nAnd |H| is 900.\n\nWe can also compute the pairwise intersections.\n\nFor example, |D \u2229 G| is the number of people owning both D and G, which would be a (H, D, G) + d (all four). Similarly, |D \u2229 S| = b + d, |G \u2229 S| = c + d.\n\nBut wait, in the inclusion-exclusion formula, we have:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nBut since everyone owns H, the union |D \u222a G \u222a S| is equal to the number of people owning at least one of D, G, S, which is 900 - w (where w is the number owning only H).\n\nSo, |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - w.\n\nNow, let's plug in the numbers:\n\n|D| = x + a + b + d = 195\n\n|G| = y + a + c + d = 367\n\n|S| = z + b + c + d = 562\n\nWe also know that:\n\nx + y + z = 437 (exactly two)\n\na + b + c = 234 (exactly three)\n\nAnd w = 229 - d (from earlier)\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nFirst, compute |D| + |G| + |S|:\n\n195 + 367 + 562 = 1124\n\nNow, compute |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|.\n\n|D\u2229G| = a + d\n\n|D\u2229S| = b + d\n\n|G\u2229S| = c + d\n\nSo, sum is (a + d) + (b + d) + (c + d) = (a + b + c) + 3d = 234 + 3d\n\nThen, |D\u2229G\u2229S| = d.\n\nSo, putting it into inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 1124 - (234 + 3d) + d = 1124 - 234 - 3d + d = 1124 - 234 - 2d = 890 - 2d.\n\nBut |D \u222a G \u222a S| is also 900 - w = 900 - (229 - d) = 900 - 229 + d = 671 + d.\n\nSo, equate the two expressions:\n\n890 - 2d = 671 + d\n\nSolving for d:\n\n890 - 671 = 3d\n\n219 = 3d\n\nd = 73.\n\nSo, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about the residents of Aimeville. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem is about sets and their overlaps, right? So, it's a classic inclusion-exclusion principle problem.\n\nAlright, let's jot down the given information:\n\nTotal residents: 900.\n\nNumber of residents owning each item:\n- Diamond ring (D): 195\n- Golf clubs (G): 367\n- Garden spade (S): 562\n- Bag of candy hearts (H): Well, it says each of the 900 owns this, so H is 900.\n\nNow, other details:\n- 437 residents own exactly two of these things.\n- 234 residents own exactly three of these things.\n- We need to find the number who own all four, which is the intersection of D, G, S, and H.\n\nWait a minute, each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, H is universal; everyone has it. That might simplify things because H is 900, and all other sets are subsets of H.\n\nLet me think about how inclusion-exclusion works here. Normally, for four sets, the formula is:\n\nTotal = |D| + |G| + |S| + |H| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| - |D\u2229H| - |G\u2229H| - |S\u2229H| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229H| + |D\u2229S\u2229H| + |G\u2229S\u2229H| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229H|\n\nBut wait, since H is 900 and everyone owns it, the intersections involving H might be easier. Because any intersection with H is just the set itself. For example, D\u2229H is just D, since all D owners also have H. Similarly, G\u2229H is G, S\u2229H is S. So that might simplify some terms.\n\nBut let's see. Wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about the intersections directly, but it gives the number of people owning exactly two and exactly three things. So maybe we can model this with the inclusion-exclusion principle by considering the counts of exactly two and exactly three overlaps.\n\nLet me recall that the formula for the union of four sets is:\n\nTotal = sum of individual sets - sum of all pairwise intersections + sum of all triple intersections - quadruple intersection.\n\nBut since H is everyone, I can think about the other sets in relation to H. Let's denote U as the universal set with |U| = 900.\n\nSo, D, G, S are subsets of U. So, the union of D, G, S, and H is just U, because H is the entire set. So, the union of D, G, S is a subset of U.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking about how many own all four, which is D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229H. But since H is everyone, that's the same as D\u2229G\u2229S. So, the number of people who own all four is the same as the number who own all three of D, G, S.\n\nHmm, that might be a useful point. So, the quadruple intersection is equal to the triple intersection of D, G, and S.\n\nBut let's see. The problem says 437 own exactly two things, and 234 own exactly three. So, the total number of people owning two or three things is 437 + 234 = 671.\n\nBut wait, the total number of people is 900, and everyone owns at least H. So, the rest must be people who own only H, right? Because they don't own any of D, G, or S. So, the number of people who own only H is 900 - (number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S). Wait, but actually, since everyone owns H, the people who own only H are those who don't own D, G, or S.\n\nSo, let's denote the number of people owning only H as x. Then, the rest, 900 - x, own at least one of D, G, or S. But according to the problem, 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. So, the number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S is 437 + 234 + (number owning exactly one). Wait, no, actually, that's not correct.\n\nWait, the total number of people owning exactly two is 437, exactly three is 234, and exactly one is something we might need to compute. Also, people could own all four, but as I thought earlier, since H is universal, owning all four is the same as owning D, G, S.\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\n- Exactly two: 437\n- Exactly three: 234\n- Exactly four: let's call this y. But since H is included in all, y is the same as the number owning D, G, S, which is the triple intersection.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the number who own all four, which is y. So, if I can find y, that's the answer.\n\nBut how? Let's think about the inclusion-exclusion for three sets D, G, S. Because H is universal, the four-set problem reduces to the three-set problem for D, G, S.\n\nSo, the formula for three sets is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nBut we also know that the number of people owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and none of D, G, S are in the universal set.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\na = number owning exactly one of D, G, S\nb = number owning exactly two of D, G, S\nc = number owning exactly three of D, G, S\nd = number owning none of D, G, S\n\nSo, from the problem, b = 437, c = 234. But wait, no. Wait, the problem says 437 own exactly two of these things, which could include H. Wait, that's a complication because H is also a thing. So, when the problem says exactly two, it could be any two of the four: D, G, S, H.\n\nOh, right! I think I messed up earlier. Because the four things are D, G, S, H. So, the residents can own any combination of these four, including H. So, the counts of exactly two and exactly three include combinations with H.\n\nOh, that changes things. So, the problem is more complex because H is one of the four things. So, someone could own exactly two things, which might include H, or exactly three, which might include H.\n\nSo, I need to model all four sets, not just three. Hmm, this complicates things, but perhaps we can manage.\n\nWait, but H is owned by everyone. So, when someone owns exactly two things, it must include H. Because if they own two things, and H is one of them, since they all have H. Wait, no. Because H is not optional; everyone owns H. So, if someone owns exactly two things, it must be H plus one other. Similarly, someone who owns exactly three things must have H plus two others. And someone who owns all four must have H plus the other three.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if someone owns exactly two, since H is mandatory, they must have H and one more. Similarly, exactly three would be H plus two more. Exactly four would be H plus all three.\n\nSo, that changes the way we model the problem. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Exactly two things: These must include H and exactly one other item. So, the count for exactly two is the sum of people owning H and D only, H and G only, H and S only.\n\n- Exactly three things: These must include H and exactly two others. So, the count is the sum of people owning H, D, G; H, D, S; and H, G, S.\n\n- Exactly four things: These would be H, D, G, S. Which is the intersection of all four, which is the same as D \u2229 G \u2229 S because H is universal.\n\nWait, so the problem states that 437 own exactly two things. So, each of these 437 owns H and exactly one other item.\n\nSimilarly, 234 own exactly three things, which means they own H and exactly two others.\n\nSo, let's define some variables:\n\nLet x be the number of people who own exactly H and D (and nothing else). Similarly, y for H and G, z for H and S.\n\nSimilarly, a for exactly H, D, G; b for H, D, S; c for H, G, S.\n\nAnd d for exactly all four: H, D, G, S. So, d is the number we need to find.\n\nThen, the counts are:\n\nExactly two: x + y + z = 437.\n\nExactly three: a + b + c = 234.\n\nExactly four: d.\n\nBut wait, no. Because exactly two is H plus one other, so x, y, z are the counts for exactly two.\n\nExactly three is H plus two others, so a, b, c are the counts for exactly three.\n\nExactly four is H plus all three, which is d.\n\nAnd the rest own only H, which is the remaining people: 900 - (x + y + z + a + b + c + d).\n\nBut wait, let's write down the total number of people as:\n\nOnly H: let's denote this as w.\n\nSo, w + x + y + z + a + b + c + d = 900.\n\nBut according to the problem, the number of people owning exactly two is 437, which is x + y + z = 437.\n\nExactly three is 234, which is a + b + c = 234.\n\nAnd the number owning exactly four is d.\n\nSo, the remaining people, 900 - (437 + 234 + d) = w.\n\nSo, w = 900 - 437 - 234 - d.\n\nWhich is w = 900 - 671 - d = 229 - d.\n\nBut I don't know w yet. So, perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion for the three sets D, G, S, considering that H is universal.\n\nWait, but H is part of the four sets. So, perhaps I should model all four sets.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of the counts for each set.\n\nEach set includes H, so:\n\n- |D| = number of people owning D. Since everyone owns H, |D| is the number who own D and H, regardless of other items. So, |D| = x + a + b + d.\n\nSimilarly, |G| = y + a + c + d.\n\n|S| = z + b + c + d.\n\nAnd |H| is 900.\n\nWe can also compute the pairwise intersections.\n\nFor example, |D \u2229 G| is the number of people owning both D and G, which would be a (H, D, G) + d (all four). Similarly, |D \u2229 S| = b + d, |G \u2229 S| = c + d.\n\nBut wait, in the inclusion-exclusion formula, we have:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nBut since everyone owns H, the union |D \u222a G \u222a S| is equal to the number of people owning at least one of D, G, S, which is 900 - w (where w is the number owning only H).\n\nSo, |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 - w.\n\nNow, let's plug in the numbers:\n\n|D| = x + a + b + d = 195\n\n|G| = y + a + c + d = 367\n\n|S| = z + b + c + d = 562\n\nWe also know that:\n\nx + y + z = 437 (exactly two)\n\na + b + c = 234 (exactly three)\n\nAnd w = 229 - d (from earlier)\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nFirst, compute |D| + |G| + |S|:\n\n195 + 367 + 562 = 1124\n\nNow, compute |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|.\n\n|D\u2229G| = a + d\n\n|D\u2229S| = b + d\n\n|G\u2229S| = c + d\n\nSo, sum is (a + d) + (b + d) + (c + d) = (a + b + c) + 3d = 234 + 3d\n\nThen, |D\u2229G\u2229S| = d.\n\nSo, putting it into inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 1124 - (234 + 3d) + d = 1124 - 234 - 3d + d = 1124 - 234 - 2d = 890 - 2d.\n\nBut |D \u222a G \u222a S| is also 900 - w = 900 - (229 - d) = 900 - 229 + d = 671 + d.\n\nSo, equate the two expressions:\n\n890 - 2d = 671 + d\n\nSolving for d:\n\n890 - 671 = 3d\n\n219 = 3d\n\nd = 73.\n\nSo, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem mentions four items: diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and candy hearts. Wait, each resident owns at least a bag of candy hearts, so that means everyone has that. Interesting.\n\nAlright, let me jot down the numbers given. There are 900 residents in total. Out of these:\n\n- 195 own a diamond ring.\n- 367 own a set of golf clubs.\n- 562 own a garden spade.\n- And every single one owns a bag of candy hearts. So, candy hearts are universal here.\n\nBut then, it says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking how many own all four. Hmm, this sounds like a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nWait, so inclusion-exclusion is the way to go here. Let me recall the formula. For four sets, the formula for the union is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |A \u2229 D| - |B \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 D| - |C \u2229 D| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 D| + |A \u2229 C \u2229 D| + |B \u2229 C \u2229 D| - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C \u2229 D|\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the number of people who own all four, which is |A \u2229 B \u2229 C \u2229 D|. But I don't have the values for all the pairwise and triple intersections. So maybe I need another approach.\n\nWait, the problem also gives me the number of people who own exactly two things and exactly three things. Maybe I can use that information.\n\nSo, let me think. In set theory, the total number of elements in the union is the sum of all individual sets minus the sum of all pairwise intersections, plus the sum of all triple intersections, minus the four-way intersection. But since every resident owns at least the candy hearts, does that mean the union is 900? Because everyone is in the union of these four sets. Hmm, yes, because the candy hearts are universal. So, |A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = 900.\n\nLet me write down the variables:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- D = number of people who own diamond rings = 195\n- G = golf clubs = 367\n- S = garden spades = 562\n- C = candy hearts = 900 (since everyone has this)\n\nNow, the number of people who own exactly two of the items is 437, and exactly three is 234. Let me denote:\n- a = number of people owning exactly two items\n- b = number of people owning exactly three items\n- c = number of people owning all four items.\n\nWait, but in the problem, a is given as 437, b as 234, and we need to find c.\n\nWait, another approach. Maybe using the inclusion-exclusion formula but breaking it down into the counts of exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four.\n\nI remember that the inclusion-exclusion formula counts all possible overlaps, but when we have exactly two, exactly three, etc., we can express the inclusion-exclusion terms in terms of these.\n\nWait, let me think again. The formula for the union is equal to the sum of the individual sets minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the sum of all triple intersections minus the four-way intersection.\n\nBut I can also express the union as the sum of all the residents who own exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four of the items.\n\nBut wait, in this case, since everyone owns at least the candy hearts, and we have four items, but the way the problem is phrased, I think the counts are for ownership of all four items, but each person owns at least one, because they all have candy hearts.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this using the principle where the total is equal to the sum of the single ownerships, minus the sum of exactly two, plus the sum of exactly three, minus the sum of exactly four.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should use the standard inclusion-exclusion but in terms of the exact counts.\n\nLet me recall that:\n\nThe total number of elements in the union is equal to:\n\n(Number owning exactly one item) + 2*(Number owning exactly two items) + 3*(Number owning exactly three items) + 4*(Number owning exactly four items).\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, let me think again. The inclusion-exclusion formula counts the overlaps, but when we count the number of people owning exactly two items, each such person is counted once in each of the two sets they belong to, but when subtracting the pairwise intersections, we subtract each exactly two owner once. Hmm, perhaps it's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula that relates the counts of exactly k items to the inclusion-exclusion terms.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Exactly one item: x\n- Exactly two items: 437\n- Exactly three items: 234\n- Exactly four items: c (what we need to find)\n\nSince every resident owns at least one item (candy hearts), the sum x + 437 + 234 + c = 900.\n\nSo, x = 900 - 437 - 234 - c = 900 - 671 - c = 229 - c.\n\nBut I don't know x yet.\n\nAlternatively, using inclusion-exclusion, let's think about the total number of ownerships.\n\nEach resident contributes 1 to each item they own. So the total number of ownerships is equal to the sum of all individual ownerships.\n\nSo, total ownerships = D + G + S + C.\n\nBut C is 900, since everyone owns candy hearts.\n\nSo, total ownerships = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = let me compute that.\n\n195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124; 1124 + 900 = 2024.\n\nSo, total ownerships is 2024.\n\nBut total ownerships can also be calculated based on the number of people and how many items each owns.\n\nEach person owns 1, 2, 3, or 4 items. So, total ownerships = sum over all people of (number of items they own).\n\nWhich is equal to:\n\n(Number of people with exactly 1 item)*1 + (number with exactly 2)*2 + (number with exactly 3)*3 + (number with exactly 4)*4.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nTotal ownerships = x*1 + 437*2 + 234*3 + c*4.\n\nSo, 2024 = x + 874 + 702 + 4c.\n\nCompute 874 +702: 874 + 700 is 1574, plus 2 is 1576. So,\n\n2024 = x + 1576 + 4c.\n\nSo, x + 4c = 2024 - 1576 = 448.\n\nBut earlier, we found that x = 229 - c.\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\n(229 - c) + 4c = 448.\n\nSimplify:\n\n229 + 3c = 448.\n\nSubtract 229: 3c = 448 - 229 = 219.\n\nSo, 3c = 219 \u2192 c = 73.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nCompute D + G + S + C:\n\n195 + 367 = 562. 562 + 562 = 1124. 1124 + 900 = 2024. Correct.\n\nTotal ownerships is 2024.\n\nCompute the other side:\n\nx*1 + 437*2 + 234*3 + c*4.\n\nWhich is x + 874 + 702 +4c.\n\nSum 874+702: 874 +700=1574 +2=1576.\n\nSo, x + 4c = 2024 -1576 =448.\n\nAnd from the total residents:\n\nx + 437 +234 +c =900 \u2192 x =900 -671 -c=229 -c.\n\nSubstitute x into x +4c=448:\n\n229 -c +4c=448 \u2192 229 +3c=448 \u2192 3c=219 \u2192 c=73.\n\nYes, that looks correct. So, the number of people who own all four items is 73.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem mentions four items: diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and candy hearts. Wait, each resident owns at least a bag of candy hearts, so that means everyone has that. Interesting.\n\nAlright, let me jot down the numbers given. There are 900 residents in total. Out of these:\n\n- 195 own a diamond ring.\n- 367 own a set of golf clubs.\n- 562 own a garden spade.\n- And every single one owns a bag of candy hearts. So, candy hearts are universal here.\n\nBut then, it says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking how many own all four. Hmm, this sounds like a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nWait, so inclusion-exclusion is the way to go here. Let me recall the formula. For four sets, the formula for the union is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |A \u2229 D| - |B \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 D| - |C \u2229 D| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 D| + |A \u2229 C \u2229 D| + |B \u2229 C \u2229 D| - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C \u2229 D|\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the number of people who own all four, which is |A \u2229 B \u2229 C \u2229 D|. But I don't have the values for all the pairwise and triple intersections. So maybe I need another approach.\n\nWait, the problem also gives me the number of people who own exactly two things and exactly three things. Maybe I can use that information.\n\nSo, let me think. In set theory, the total number of elements in the union is the sum of all individual sets minus the sum of all pairwise intersections, plus the sum of all triple intersections, minus the four-way intersection. But since every resident owns at least the candy hearts, does that mean the union is 900? Because everyone is in the union of these four sets. Hmm, yes, because the candy hearts are universal. So, |A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = 900.\n\nLet me write down the variables:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- D = number of people who own diamond rings = 195\n- G = golf clubs = 367\n- S = garden spades = 562\n- C = candy hearts = 900 (since everyone has this)\n\nNow, the number of people who own exactly two of the items is 437, and exactly three is 234. Let me denote:\n- a = number of people owning exactly two items\n- b = number of people owning exactly three items\n- c = number of people owning all four items.\n\nWait, but in the problem, a is given as 437, b as 234, and we need to find c.\n\nWait, another approach. Maybe using the inclusion-exclusion formula but breaking it down into the counts of exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four.\n\nI remember that the inclusion-exclusion formula counts all possible overlaps, but when we have exactly two, exactly three, etc., we can express the inclusion-exclusion terms in terms of these.\n\nWait, let me think again. The formula for the union is equal to the sum of the individual sets minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the sum of all triple intersections minus the four-way intersection.\n\nBut I can also express the union as the sum of all the residents who own exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four of the items.\n\nBut wait, in this case, since everyone owns at least the candy hearts, and we have four items, but the way the problem is phrased, I think the counts are for ownership of all four items, but each person owns at least one, because they all have candy hearts.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this using the principle where the total is equal to the sum of the single ownerships, minus the sum of exactly two, plus the sum of exactly three, minus the sum of exactly four.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should use the standard inclusion-exclusion but in terms of the exact counts.\n\nLet me recall that:\n\nThe total number of elements in the union is equal to:\n\n(Number owning exactly one item) + 2*(Number owning exactly two items) + 3*(Number owning exactly three items) + 4*(Number owning exactly four items).\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, let me think again. The inclusion-exclusion formula counts the overlaps, but when we count the number of people owning exactly two items, each such person is counted once in each of the two sets they belong to, but when subtracting the pairwise intersections, we subtract each exactly two owner once. Hmm, perhaps it's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula that relates the counts of exactly k items to the inclusion-exclusion terms.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Exactly one item: x\n- Exactly two items: 437\n- Exactly three items: 234\n- Exactly four items: c (what we need to find)\n\nSince every resident owns at least one item (candy hearts), the sum x + 437 + 234 + c = 900.\n\nSo, x = 900 - 437 - 234 - c = 900 - 671 - c = 229 - c.\n\nBut I don't know x yet.\n\nAlternatively, using inclusion-exclusion, let's think about the total number of ownerships.\n\nEach resident contributes 1 to each item they own. So the total number of ownerships is equal to the sum of all individual ownerships.\n\nSo, total ownerships = D + G + S + C.\n\nBut C is 900, since everyone owns candy hearts.\n\nSo, total ownerships = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = let me compute that.\n\n195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124; 1124 + 900 = 2024.\n\nSo, total ownerships is 2024.\n\nBut total ownerships can also be calculated based on the number of people and how many items each owns.\n\nEach person owns 1, 2, 3, or 4 items.

So,\n\n2024 = x + 1576 + 4c.\n\nSo, x + 4c = 2024 - 1576 = 448.\n\nBut earlier, we found that x = 229 - c.\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\n(229 - c) + 4c = 448.\n\nSimplify:\n\n229 + 3c = 448.\n\nSubtract 229: 3c = 448 - 229 = 219.\n\nSo, 3c = 219 \u2192 c = 73.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nCompute D + G + S + C:\n\n195 + 367 = 562. 562 + 562 = 1124. 1124 + 900 = 2024.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about the residents of Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says there are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So, candy hearts are universal\u2014they're owned by everyone. That's one thing everyone has, so that's four items each could potentially own: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. But since everyone has candy hearts, maybe that simplifies things a bit.\n\nNow, let me note down the numbers:\n\n- Number of residents owning a diamond ring (let's denote this as D) = 195\n- Number owning a set of golf clubs (G) = 367\n- Number owning a garden spade (S) = 562\n- Everyone owns candy hearts (C), so C = 900\n\nAlso given:\n\n- 437 residents own exactly two of these things.\n- 234 residents own exactly three of these things.\n\nAnd the question is asking for the number of residents who own all four of these things. Let's denote this number as x.\n\nHmm, this seems like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on.\n\nBut wait, in this case, we're dealing with four sets: D, G, S, and C. But since everyone owns C, maybe it's easier to consider C as a set that includes everyone, so it might not complicate the intersections. Or perhaps we can think of the problem in terms of the other three items, since C is universal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this using the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. The formula for the union of four sets is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229S| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut wait, since everyone owns C, |C|=900, and any intersection involving C will be the same as the other set. For example, |D\u2229C| is just |D| because if someone owns D, they must own C. Similarly, |D\u2229G\u2229C| is the same as |D\u2229G|, and so on. This might simplify the equation.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe instead of dealing with the union, since all residents have C, the union is the entire population, so |D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = 900. That could be useful.\n\nSo, plugging into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\n900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229S| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut since |C| is 900, and any intersection with C is the same as the other set. Let me see:\n\n- |D\u2229C| = |D| = 195\n- |G\u2229C| = |G| = 367\n- |S\u2229C| = |S| = 562\n- |D\u2229G\u2229C| = |D\u2229G|\n- |D\u2229S\u2229C| = |D\u2229S|\n- |G\u2229S\u2229C| = |G\u2229S|\n- |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C| = |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C| = x (the number we're trying to find)\n\nSo substituting all that into the equation:\n\n900 = D + G + S + C - (D\u2229G) - (D\u2229S) - (D\u2229C) - (G\u2229S) - (G\u2229C) - (S\u2229C) + (D\u2229G\u2229S) + (D\u2229G\u2229C) + (D\u2229S\u2229C) + (G\u2229S\u2229C) - (D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C)\n\nBut since D\u2229C is D, G\u2229C is G, and S\u2229C is S, this simplifies to:\n\n900 = D + G + S + C - (D\u2229G + D\u2229S + G\u2229S) - (D + G + S) + (D\u2229G\u2229S + D\u2229G + D\u2229S + G\u2229S) - x\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to substitute step by step.\n\nLet me first write down all the terms:\n\n= D + G + S + C \n- (D\u2229G + D\u2229S + G\u2229S + D + G + S) \n+ (D\u2229G\u2229S + D\u2229G + D\u2229S + G\u2229S) \n- x\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the problem using the given numbers about exactly two and exactly three items. Because the problem gives me the number of people owning exactly two things and exactly three things, which might help.\n\nIn inclusion-exclusion, the counts for exactly two and exactly three can be used to find the intersections.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me recall that in inclusion-exclusion, the total number of elements in the union is the sum of the individual sets minus the sum of all two-set intersections plus the sum of all three-set intersections minus the four-set intersection.\n\nBut since we have universal ownership of C, maybe that can help in simplifying the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the problem by considering the four items: D, G, S, and C, where C is owned by everyone. So, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the other three items, D, G, S, since C is already everywhere.\n\nWait, but the problem includes all four, so I can't ignore C. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of people owning at least one item, but since everyone owns C, the total number is 900. So, the union of D, G, S, and C is 900.\n\nLet me try to write the inclusion-exclusion formula again, but this time substituting the known values and expressions.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\n900 = |D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| \n= |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| \n- |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229S| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| \n+ |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| \n- |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut as I realized earlier, because C is universal, any intersection with C is just the other set. So:\n\n- |D\u2229C| = D = 195\n- |G\u2229C| = G = 367\n- |S\u2229C| = S = 562\n- |D\u2229G\u2229C| = |D\u2229G|\n- |D\u2229S\u2229C| = |D\u2229S|\n- |G\u2229S\u2229C| = |G\u2229S|\n- |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C| = x\n\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n\n900 = D + G + S + C \n- (D\u2229G + D\u2229S + D + G + S) \n+ (D\u2229G\u2229S + D\u2229G + D\u2229S + G\u2229S) \n- x\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy. Let me write it more carefully.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n= D + G + S + C\n- (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |D\u2229C| + |G\u2229S| + |G\u2229C| + |S\u2229C|)\n+ (|D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C|)\n- |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nSubstituting:\n\n= D + G + S + C\n- (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + D + G + S + S)\nWait, no, because |D\u2229C|=D, |G\u2229C|=G, |S\u2229C|=S. So:\n\nSo the second term is:\n\n- (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + D + G + S + S)\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because |D\u2229C|=D, but |S\u2229C|=S, so |S\u2229C| is S, which is 562. So the second term is |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + D + G + S + S. Wait, that would be adding D twice because |D\u2229C|=D, and |S\u2229C|=S. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's take it step by step. The second term in the inclusion-exclusion formula is the sum of all two-set intersections. So that would be |D\u2229G|, |D\u2229S|, |D\u2229C|, |G\u2229S|, |G\u2229C|, |S\u2229C|.\n\nWhich is:\n\n|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |D\u2229C| + |G\u2229S| + |G\u2229C| + |S\u2229C|\n\nBut |D\u2229C| is D, |G\u2229C| is G, |S\u2229C| is S. So substituting:\n\n= |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + D + |G\u2229S| + G + S\n\nSo the second term is |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| + D + G + S.\n\nSimilarly, the third term in the inclusion-exclusion formula is the sum of all three-set intersections. These are |D\u2229G\u2229S|, |D\u2229G\u2229C|, |D\u2229S\u2229C|, |G\u2229S\u2229C|.\n\nBut |D\u2229G\u2229C| is |D\u2229G|, because C is universal. Similarly, |D\u2229S\u2229C|=|D\u2229S|, and |G\u2229S\u2229C|=|G\u2229S|. So the third term becomes |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the third term is |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|.\n\nThe fourth term is |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|, which is x.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n900 = D + G + S + C\n- (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| + D + G + S)\n+ (|D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|)\n- x\n\nNow, let's substitute the known values:\n\nD = 195, G = 367, S = 562, C = 900.\n\nSo:\n\n900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 \n- (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| + 195 + 367 + 562)\n+ (|D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|)\n- x\n\nLet me compute the sum of D, G, S, and C first:\n\n195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124; 1124 + 900 = 2024.\n\nSo:\n\n900 = 2024 \n- (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| + 195 + 367 + 562)\n+ (|D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|)\n- x\n\nNow, compute the sum inside the second term:\n\n195 + 367 + 562 = 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124.\n\nSo the second term becomes:\n\n(|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| + 1124)\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n900 = 2024 - (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| + 1124) + (|D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|) - x\n\nSimplify this:\n\n= 2024 - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| - 1124 + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| - x\n\nNow, let's cancel out terms:\n\n- |D\u2229G| and + |D\u2229G| cancel.\n\nSame for |D\u2229S| and |G\u2229S|.\n\nSo what's left is:\n\n2024 - 1124 + |D\u2229G\u2229S| - x\n\nWhich is:\n\n(2024 - 1124) + |D\u2229G\u2229S| - x = 900\n\n2024 - 1124 = 900, so:\n\n900 + |D\u2229G\u2229S| - x = 900\n\nSubtract 900 from both sides:\n\n|D\u2229G\u2229S| - x = 0\n\nWhich implies that |D\u2229G\u2229S| = x\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the number of people owning all three D, G, and S is equal to x, the number owning all four (since C is already included in all). Hmm, but wait, because if someone owns all four, they must own D, G, S, and C. But C is already in everyone, so |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C| is the same as |D\u2229G\u2229S|. So, x = |D\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nWait, but that's what we just found: |D\u2229G\u2229S| = x.\n\nBut how does that help us? Because we have to find x, but we don't know |D\u2229G\u2229S| directly.\n\nWait, maybe I can find |D\u2229G\u2229S| using the information given about exactly two and exactly three items.\n\nThe problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of the things, and 234 own exactly three.\n\nSince C is universal, perhaps the counts for exactly two and exactly three items don't include C? Or do they?\n\nWait, I think the problem counts ownership of exactly two or three among the four items, including C. But since C is owned by everyone, maybe the counts for exactly two items would only be considering the other three (D, G, S), because C is already included.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nEach resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so they must own C. So when the problem says someone owns exactly two of these things, it could be any two of the four. But since C is always there, owning exactly two would mean they own C plus one other item. Because if they own exactly two, and C is one, then the other one must be either D, G, or S.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, because exactly two could be any two of the four, but since C is always owned, you can't have someone owning exactly two items without C. So, the two items must include C and one other. Similarly, someone owning exactly three items must have C plus two others. And someone owning all four would have C plus the other three.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, the counts for exactly two, exactly three, and all four must be considered in that way.\n\nSo, the number of people owning exactly two things is 437. But since they must own C plus one other, that means they own exactly one of D, G, or S, along with C. So, the number of people owning exactly two things is the sum of people owning exactly C and D, C and G, and C and S.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three things is 234. These would be the people owning C plus two of D, G, S. So, the number owning C, D, and G; C, D, and S; or C, G, and S.\n\nAnd the number of people owning all four is x, which is the same as the number of people owning C, D, G, and S.\n\nSo, let's model this with variables.\n\nLet me define:\n\na = number of people owning exactly C and D (i.e., exactly two things)\nb = number of people owning exactly C and G\nc = number of people owning exactly C and S\nd = number of people owning exactly C, D, and G (exactly three things)\ne = number of people owning exactly C, D, and S\nf = number of people owning exactly C, G, and S\ng = number of people owning all four: C, D, G, S (which is x)\n\nSo, according to the problem:\n\na + b + c = 437 (exactly two things)\nd + e + f = 234 (exactly three things)\ng = x (exactly four things)\n\nNow, the total number of people is the sum of all these plus those who own only C. Wait, but since everyone owns C, the only people not owning any other items would own only C. But the problem doesn't mention that. Hmm, wait, but the problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so they must own at least C. So, the total number of residents is the sum of all the people owning exactly one, two, three, or four items.\n\nWait, but the problem says that 437 own exactly two, 234 own exactly three, and x own exactly four. So, what about those who own exactly one item? Since everyone owns C, the only way to own exactly one item is to own only C.\n\nSo, let's let h be the number of people owning exactly one thing, which is C.\n\nSo, the total number of people is:\n\nh + (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) + g = 900\n\nWhich is:\n\nh + 437 + 234 + x = 900\n\nSo, h = 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x\n\nWait, but h can't be negative, so 229 - x >= 0 => x <= 229.\n\nBut let's not get ahead of ourselves. Now, how do we find x?\n\nWe can use the inclusion-exclusion principle, but perhaps using the information about exactly two, three, and four.\n\nLet me think about the counts for each set.\n\nThe number of people owning D is 195. This includes those owning exactly D and C (a), those owning D, C, and G (d), those owning D, C, and S (e), and those owning all four (g). So:\n\n195 = a + d + e + g\n\nSimilarly, the number owning G is 367:\n\n367 = b + d + f + g\n\nAnd the number owning S is 562:\n\n562 = c + e + f + g\n\nWe also have the counts for exactly two and exactly three.\n\nWe have a + b + c = 437 (exactly two)\n\nd + e + f = 234 (exactly three)\n\nAnd g = x.\n\nWe also have h = 229 - x, as found earlier.\n\nNow, let's write down all the equations we have:\n\n1. a + b + c = 437\n2. d + e + f = 234\n3. g = x\n4. h = 229 - x\n5. a + d + e + g = 195\n6. b + d + f + g = 367\n7. c + e + f + g = 562\n\nOur goal is to find x. So, let's see how we can solve these equations.\n\nLet me try to express a, b, c in terms of other variables.\n\nFrom equation 5: a = 195 - d - e - g\n\nFrom equation 6: b = 367 - d - f - g\n\nFrom equation 7: c = 562 - e - f - g\n\nNow, substitute these into equation 1:\n\n(195 - d - e - g) + (367 - d - f - g) + (562 - e - f - g) = 437\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n195 + 367 + 562 = 1124\n\nNow, subtract the other terms:\n\n- d - e - g - d - f - g - e - f - g\n\nWhich is:\n\n-2d - 2e - 2f - 3g\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes:\n\n1124 - 2d - 2e - 2f - 3g = 437\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-2d - 2e - 2f -3g = 437 - 1124 = -687\n\nMultiply both sides by (-1):\n\n2d + 2e + 2f + 3g = 687\n\nBut from equation 2, we know that d + e + f = 234. Let's denote that as equation 2.\n\nLet me write equation 2: d + e + f = 234.\n\nSo, 2d + 2e + 2f = 2*(234) = 468.\n\nSo, substituting back into the previous equation:\n\n468 + 3g = 687\n\nSo, 3g = 687 - 468 = 219\n\nTherefore, g = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nSo, x = g = 73.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me recap:\n\nWe had equation 1: a + b + c = 437\n\nExpressed a, b, c in terms of d, e, f, g.\n\nSubstituted into equation 1, which gave us 2d + 2e + 2f + 3g = 687.\n\nWe know d + e + f = 234, so 2d + 2e + 2f = 468.\n\nSo, 468 + 3g = 687 \u2192 3g = 219 \u2192 g = 73.\n\nSo, x = 73.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense with the other equations.\n\nLet me compute h = 229 - x = 229 - 73 = 156. So, 156 people own only C.\n\nNow, let me compute a, b, c using the expressions from equations 5,6,7.\n\nFrom equation 5: a = 195 - d - e - g\n\nBut we don't know d, e, f yet, but we do know that d + e + f = 234.\n\nWait, perhaps we can find d, e, f.\n\nFrom equation 5: a = 195 - d - e - g \u2192 a = 195 - (d + e) - g.\n\nSimilarly, since d + e + f =234, we can write d + e = 234 - f.\n\nSo, a = 195 - (234 - f) - g \u2192 a = 195 - 234 + f - g \u2192 a = -39 + f - g.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 6: b = 367 - d - f - g.\n\nFrom equation 7: c = 562 - e - f - g.\n\nBut this might not be the best way to find a, b, c. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the sum a + b + c.\n\nWait, a + b + c = (195 - d - e - g) + (367 - d - f - g) + (562 - e - f - g)\n\nWhich is 195 + 367 + 562 - 2d - 2e - 2f - 3g\n\nWe know that 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124\n\nAnd 2d + 2e + 2f = 468, and 3g = 219.\n\nSo, 1124 - 468 - 219 = 1124 - 687 = 437, which matches equation 1. So that's consistent.\n\nSo, the value x = 73 seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given information about residents owning exactly two, three, or all four items.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about the residents of Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says there are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So, candy hearts are universal\u2014they're owned by everyone. That's one thing everyone has, so that's four items each could potentially own: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. But since everyone has candy hearts, maybe that simplifies things a bit.\n\nNow, let me note down the numbers:\n\n- Number of residents owning a diamond ring (let's denote this as D) = 195\n- Number owning a set of golf clubs (G) = 367\n- Number owning a garden spade (S) = 562\n- Everyone owns candy hearts (C), so C = 900\n\nAlso given:\n\n- 437 residents own exactly two of these things.\n- 234 residents own exactly three of these things.\n\nAnd the question is asking for the number of residents who own all four of these things. Let's denote this number as x.\n\nHmm, this seems like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on.\n\nBut wait, in this case, we're dealing with four sets: D, G, S, and C. But since everyone owns C, maybe it's easier to consider C as a set that includes everyone, so it might not complicate the intersections. Or perhaps we can think of the problem in terms of the other three items, since C is universal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this using the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. The formula for the union of four sets is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229S| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut wait, since everyone owns C, |C|=900, and any intersection involving C will be the same as the other set. For example, |D\u2229C| is just |D| because if someone owns D, they must own C. Similarly, |D\u2229G\u2229C| is the same as |D\u2229G|, and so on. This might simplify the equation.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe instead of dealing with the union, since all residents have C, the union is the entire population, so |D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = 900. That could be useful.\n\nSo, plugging into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\n900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229S| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut since |C| is 900, and any intersection with C is the same as the other set. Let me see:\n\n- |D\u2229C| = |D| = 195\n- |G\u2229C| = |G| = 367\n- |S\u2229C| = |S| = 562\n- |D\u2229G\u2229C| = |D\u2229G|\n- |D\u2229S\u2229C| = |D\u2229S|\n- |G\u2229S\u2229C| = |G\u2229S|\n- |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C| = |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C| = x (the number we're trying to find)\n\nSo substituting all that into the equation:\n\n900 = D + G + S + C - (D\u2229G) - (D\u2229S) - (D\u2229C) - (G\u2229S) - (G\u2229C) - (S\u2229C) + (D\u2229G\u2229S) + (D\u2229G\u2229C) + (D\u2229S\u2229C) + (G\u2229S\u2229C) - (D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C)\n\nBut since D\u2229C is D, G\u2229C is G, and S\u2229C is S, this simplifies to:\n\n900 = D + G + S + C - (D\u2229G + D\u2229S + G\u2229S) - (D + G + S) + (D\u2229G\u2229S + D\u2229G + D\u2229S + G\u2229S) - x\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to substitute step by step.\n\nLet me first write down all the terms:\n\n= D + G + S + C \n- (D\u2229G + D\u2229S + G\u2229S + D + G + S) \n+ (D\u2229G\u2229S + D\u2229G + D\u2229S + G\u2229S) \n- x\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the problem using the given numbers about exactly two and exactly three items. Because the problem gives me the number of people owning exactly two things and exactly three things, which might help.\n\nIn inclusion-exclusion, the counts for exactly two and exactly three can be used to find the intersections.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me recall that in inclusion-exclusion, the total number of elements in the union is the sum of the individual sets minus the sum of all two-set intersections plus the sum of all three-set intersections minus the four-set intersection.\n\nBut since we have universal ownership of C, maybe that can help in simplifying the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the problem by considering the four items: D, G, S, and C, where C is owned by everyone. So, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the other three items, D, G, S, since C is already everywhere.\n\nWait, but the problem includes all four, so I can't ignore C. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of people owning at least one item, but since everyone owns C, the total number is 900. So, the union of D, G, S, and C is 900.\n\nLet me try to write the inclusion-exclusion formula again, but this time substituting the known values and expressions.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\n900 = |D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| \n= |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| \n- |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229S| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| \n+ |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| \n- |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut as I realized earlier, because C is universal, any intersection with C is just the other set. So:\n\n- |D\u2229C| = D = 195\n- |G\u2229C| = G = 367\n- |S\u2229C| = S = 562\n- |D\u2229G\u2229C| = |D\u2229G|\n- |D\u2229S\u2229C| = |D\u2229S|\n- |G\u2229S\u2229C| = |G\u2229S|\n- |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C| = x\n\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n\n900 = D + G + S + C \n- (D\u2229G + D\u2229S + D + G + S) \n+ (D\u2229G\u2229S + D\u2229G + D\u2229S + G\u2229S) \n- x\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy. Let me write it more carefully.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n= D + G + S + C\n- (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |D\u2229C| + |G\u2229S| + |G\u2229C| + |S\u2229C|)\n+ (|D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C|)\n- |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nSubstituting:\n\n= D + G + S + C\n- (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + D + G + S + S)\nWait, no, because |D\u2229C|=D, |G\u2229C|=G, |S\u2229C|=S. So:\n\nSo the second term is:\n\n- (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + D + G + S + S)\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because |D\u2229C|=D, but |S\u2229C|=S, so |S\u2229C| is S, which is 562. So the second term is |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + D + G + S + S. Wait, that would be adding D twice because |D\u2229C|=D, and |S\u2229C|=S. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's take it step by step. The second term in the inclusion-exclusion formula is the sum of all two-set intersections. So that would be |D\u2229G|, |D\u2229S|, |D\u2229C|, |G\u2229S|, |G\u2229C|, |S\u2229C|.\n\nWhich is:\n\n|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |D\u2229C| + |G\u2229S| + |G\u2229C| + |S\u2229C|\n\nBut |D\u2229C| is D, |G\u2229C| is G, |S\u2229C| is S. So substituting:\n\n= |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + D + |G\u2229S| + G + S\n\nSo the second term is |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| + D + G + S.\n\nSimilarly, the third term in the inclusion-exclusion formula is the sum of all three-set intersections. These are |D\u2229G\u2229S|, |D\u2229G\u2229C|, |D\u2229S\u2229C|, |G\u2229S\u2229C|.\n\nBut |D\u2229G\u2229C| is |D\u2229G|, because C is universal. Similarly, |D\u2229S\u2229C|=|D\u2229S|, and |G\u2229S\u2229C|=|G\u2229S|. So the third term becomes |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the third term is |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|.\n\nThe fourth term is |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|, which is x.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n900 = D + G + S + C\n- (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| + D + G + S)\n+ (|D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|)\n- x\n\nNow, let's substitute the known values:\n\nD = 195, G = 367, S = 562, C = 900.\n\nSo:\n\n900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 \n- (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| + 195 + 367 + 562)\n+ (|D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|)\n- x\n\nLet me compute the sum of D, G, S, and C first:\n\n195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124; 1124 + 900 = 2024.\n\nSo:\n\n900 = 2024 \n- (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| + 195 + 367 + 562)\n+ (|D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|)\n- x\n\nNow, compute the sum inside the second term:\n\n195 + 367 + 562 = 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124.\n\nSo the second term becomes:\n\n(|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| + 1124)\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n900 = 2024 - (|D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| + 1124) + (|D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S|) - x\n\nSimplify this:\n\n= 2024 - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| - 1124 + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G| + |D\u2229S| + |G\u2229S| - x\n\nNow, let's cancel out terms:\n\n- |D\u2229G| and + |D\u2229G| cancel.\n\nSame for |D\u2229S| and |G\u2229S|.\n\nSo what's left is:\n\n2024 - 1124 + |D\u2229G\u2229S| - x\n\nWhich is:\n\n(2024 - 1124) + |D\u2229G\u2229S| - x = 900\n\n2024 - 1124 = 900, so:\n\n900 + |D\u2229G\u2229S| - x = 900\n\nSubtract 900 from both sides:\n\n|D\u2229G\u2229S| - x = 0\n\nWhich implies that |D\u2229G\u2229S| = x\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the number of people owning all three D, G, and S is equal to x, the number owning all four (since C is already included in all). Hmm, but wait, because if someone owns all four, they must own D, G, S, and C. But C is already in everyone, so |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C| is the same as |D\u2229G\u2229S|. So, x = |D\u2229G\u2229S|\n\nWait, but that's what we just found: |D\u2229G\u2229S| = x.\n\nBut how does that help us? Because we have to find x, but we don't know |D\u2229G\u2229S| directly.\n\nWait, maybe I can find |D\u2229G\u2229S| using the information given about exactly two and exactly three items.\n\nThe problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of the things, and 234 own exactly three.\n\nSince C is universal, perhaps the counts for exactly two and exactly three items don't include C? Or do they?\n\nWait, I think the problem counts ownership of exactly two or three among the four items, including C. But since C is owned by everyone, maybe the counts for exactly two items would only be considering the other three (D, G, S), because C is already included.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nEach resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so they must own C. So when the problem says someone owns exactly two of these things, it could be any two of the four. But since C is always there, owning exactly two would mean they own C plus one other item. Because if they own exactly two, and C is one, then the other one must be either D, G, or S.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, because exactly two could be any two of the four, but since C is always owned, you can't have someone owning exactly two items without C. So, the two items must include C and one other. Similarly, someone owning exactly three items must have C plus two others. And someone owning all four would have C plus the other three.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, the counts for exactly two, exactly three, and all four must be considered in that way.\n\nSo, the number of people owning exactly two things is 437. But since they must own C plus one other, that means they own exactly one of D, G, or S, along with C. So, the number of people owning exactly two things is the sum of people owning exactly C and D, C and G, and C and S.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people owning exactly three things is 234. These would be the people owning C plus two of D, G, S. So, the number owning C, D, and G; C, D, and S; or C, G, and S.\n\nAnd the number of people owning all four is x, which is the same as the number of people owning C, D, G, and S.\n\nSo, let's model this with variables.\n\nLet me define:\n\na = number of people owning exactly C and D (i.e., exactly two things)\nb = number of people owning exactly C and G\nc = number of people owning exactly C and S\nd = number of people owning exactly C, D, and G (exactly three things)\ne = number of people owning exactly C, D, and S\nf = number of people owning exactly C, G, and S\ng = number of people owning all four: C, D, G, S (which is x)\n\nSo, according to the problem:\n\na + b + c = 437 (exactly two things)\nd + e + f = 234 (exactly three things)\ng = x (exactly four things)\n\nNow, the total number of people is the sum of all these plus those who own only C. Wait, but since everyone owns C, the only people not owning any other items would own only C. But the problem doesn't mention that. Hmm, wait, but the problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so they must own at least C. So, the total number of residents is the sum of all the people owning exactly one, two, three, or four items.\n\nWait, but the problem says that 437 own exactly two, 234 own exactly three, and x own exactly four. So, what about those who own exactly one item? Since everyone owns C, the only way to own exactly one item is to own only C.\n\nSo, let's let h be the number of people owning exactly one thing, which is C.\n\nSo, the total number of people is:\n\nh + (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) + g = 900\n\nWhich is:\n\nh + 437 + 234 + x = 900\n\nSo, h = 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x\n\nWait, but h can't be negative, so 229 - x >= 0 => x <= 229.\n\nBut let's not get ahead of ourselves. Now, how do we find x?\n\nWe can use the inclusion-exclusion principle, but perhaps using the information about exactly two, three, and four.\n\nLet me think about the counts for each set.\n\nThe number of people owning D is 195. This includes those owning exactly D and C (a), those owning D, C, and G (d), those owning D, C, and S (e), and those owning all four (g). So:\n\n195 = a + d + e + g\n\nSimilarly, the number owning G is 367:\n\n367 = b + d + f + g\n\nAnd the number owning S is 562:\n\n562 = c + e + f + g\n\nWe also have the counts for exactly two and exactly three.\n\nWe have a + b + c = 437 (exactly two)\n\nd + e + f = 234 (exactly three)\n\nAnd g = x.\n\nWe also have h = 229 - x, as found earlier.\n\nNow, let's write down all the equations we have:\n\n1. a + b + c = 437\n2. d + e + f = 234\n3. g = x\n4. h = 229 - x\n5. a + d + e + g = 195\n6. b + d + f + g = 367\n7. c + e + f + g = 562\n\nOur goal is to find x. So, let's see how we can solve these equations.\n\nLet me try to express a, b, c in terms of other variables.\n\nFrom equation 5: a = 195 - d - e - g\n\nFrom equation 6: b = 367 - d - f - g\n\nFrom equation 7: c = 562 - e - f - g\n\nNow, substitute these into equation 1:\n\n(195 - d - e - g) + (367 - d - f - g) + (562 - e - f - g) = 437\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n195 + 367 + 562 = 1124\n\nNow, subtract the other terms:\n\n- d - e - g - d - f - g - e - f - g\n\nWhich is:\n\n-2d - 2e - 2f - 3g\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes:\n\n1124 - 2d - 2e - 2f - 3g = 437\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-2d - 2e - 2f -3g = 437 - 1124 = -687\n\nMultiply both sides by (-1):\n\n2d + 2e + 2f + 3g = 687\n\nBut from equation 2, we know that d + e + f = 234. Let's denote that as equation 2.\n\nLet me write equation 2: d + e + f = 234.\n\nSo, 2d + 2e + 2f = 2*(234) = 468.\n\nSo, substituting back into the previous equation:\n\n468 + 3g = 687\n\nSo, 3g = 687 - 468 = 219\n\nTherefore, g = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nSo, x = g = 73.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me recap:\n\nWe had equation 1: a + b + c = 437\n\nExpressed a, b, c in terms of d, e, f, g.\n\nSubstituted into equation 1, which gave us 2d + 2e + 2f + 3g = 687.\n\nWe know d + e + f = 234, so 2d + 2e + 2f = 468.\n\nSo, 468 + 3g = 687 \u2192 3g = 219 \u2192 g = 73.\n\nSo, x = 73.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense with the other equations.\n\nLet me compute h = 229 - x = 229 - 73 = 156. So, 156 people own only C.\n\nNow, let me compute a, b, c using the expressions from equations 5,6,7.\n\nFrom equation 5: a = 195 - d - e - g\n\nBut we don't know d, e, f yet, but we do know that d + e + f = 234.\n\nWait, perhaps we can find d, e, f.\n\nFrom equation 5: a = 195 - d - e - g \u2192 a = 195 - (d + e) - g.\n\nSimilarly, since d + e + f =234, we can write d + e = 234 - f.\n\nSo, a = 195 - (234 - f) - g \u2192 a = 195 - 234 + f - g \u2192 a = -39 + f - g.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 6: b = 367 - d - f - g.\n\nFrom equation 7: c = 562 - e - f - g.\n\nBut this might not be the best way to find a, b, c. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the sum a + b + c.\n\nWait, a + b + c = (195 - d - e - g) + (367 - d - f - g) + (562 - e - f - g)\n\nWhich is 195 + 367 + 562 - 2d - 2e - 2f - 3g\n\nWe know that 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124\n\nAnd 2d + 2e + 2f = 468, and 3g = 219.\n\nSo, 1124 - 468 - 219 = 1124 - 687 = 437, which matches equation 1. So that's consistent.\n\nSo, the value x = 73 seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given information about residents owning exactly two, three, or all four items. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of residents owning all four items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts).\n   - Let \\( a, b, c \\) be the number of residents owning exactly two items (C and one other).\n   - Let \\( d, e, f \\) be the number of residents owning exactly three items (C and two others).\n   - Let \\( h \\) be the number of residents owning only candy hearts.\n\n2. **Given Data:**\n   - Total residents: \\( 900 \\)\n   - Residents owning exactly two items: \\( a + b + c = 437 \\)\n   - Residents owning exactly three items: \\( d + e + f = 234 \\)\n   - Residents owning all four items: \\( g = x \\)\n   - Residents owning only candy hearts: \\( h = 900 - (a + b + c + d + e + f + g) = 229 - x \\)\n\n3. **Set Up Equations:**\n   Using the counts of residents owning each item:\n   - Diamond ring: \\( 195 = a + d + e + g \\)\n   - Golf clubs: \\( 367 = b + d + f + g \\)\n   - Garden spade: \\( 562 = c + e + f + g \\)\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   Substitute \\( a, b, c \\) in terms of \\( d, e, f, g \\) into the equation \\( a + b + c = 437 \\):\n   \\[\n   (195 - d - e - g) + (367 - d - f - g) + (562 - e - f - g) = 437\n   \\]\n   Simplify to find:\n   \\[\n   2d + 2e + 2f + 3g = 687\n   \\]\n   Using \\( d + e + f = 234 \\), substitute \\( 2d + 2e + 2f = 468 \\):\n   \\[\n   468 + 3g = 687 \\implies 3g = 219 \\implies g = 73\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four items is \\( \\boxed{73} \\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. There are four items: diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and candy hearts. Each resident owns at least a bag of candy hearts, which means everyone has at least one of these four. The question is asking how many residents own all four of these items. \n\nLet me try to break this down. First, I know that all 900 residents own a bag of candy hearts. So, the universal set here is 900 people. The other three items\u2014diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades\u2014are owned by 195, 367, and 562 residents respectively. \n\nWait, but the problem also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, I need to use this information to find out how many own all four. \n\nHmm, I think this is a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. That's the one where you calculate the total number of elements in multiple sets by adding them up and then subtracting the overlaps, right? But I'm not entirely sure how to apply it here because we're dealing with exactly two and exactly three, not just the overlaps.\n\nLet me recall the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets. The formula for the union of four sets A, B, C, D is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |A\u2229D| - |B\u2229C| - |B\u2229D| - |C\u2229D| + |A\u2229B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229D| + |A\u2229C\u2229D| + |B\u2229C\u2229D| - |A\u2229B\u2229C\u2229D|\n\nBut wait, in this problem, everyone owns at least one thing, and that thing is the candy hearts. So, the union of all four sets should be equal to 900. So, |A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = 900.\n\nBut I'm given the numbers for each individual set: |A| is 195 (diamond rings), |B| is 367 (golf clubs), |C| is 562 (garden spades), and |D| is 900 (candy hearts). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so D is actually the entire set. So, all residents are in D. So, the union is D, which is 900. So, |A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = |D| = 900.\n\nSo, the inclusion-exclusion formula simplifies because D is the universal set. Let me write that again:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nBut wait, in this case, since D is the universal set, and we're considering the union of A, B, C, and D as 900, which is the same as the union of A, B, and C because D already includes everyone. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the problem using the inclusion-exclusion principle for exactly two and exactly three overlaps. The problem gives me the number of people who own exactly two of the four things (437) and exactly three (234). I need to relate this to the total number of people.\n\nLet me think about the standard inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets, but here we have four. Wait, perhaps I should model it as the total number of people owning at least one item is 900. But since everyone owns candy hearts, the total is 900.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the counts for each category: exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, exactly four. The problem doesn't directly give me the number of people with exactly one, but I can calculate it.\n\nWait, the problem says 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. So, the remaining would be the ones who own exactly one and exactly four. But wait, the total is 900, so:\n\nTotal = Exactly1 + Exactly2 + Exactly3 + Exactly4.\n\nSo, Exactly1 + 437 + 234 + Exactly4 = 900.\n\nSo, Exactly1 + Exactly4 = 900 - (437 + 234) = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, Exactly1 + Exactly4 = 229.\n\nBut I don't know exactly what Exactly1 is. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets. Let me try that.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nTotal = A + B + C + D - (AB + AC + AD + BC + BD + CD) + (ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD) - ABCD\n\nBut in this case, D is 900, since everyone owns candy hearts. So, D is the universal set. So, the union of A, B, C, D is 900. So, the formula becomes:\n\n900 = A + B + C + D - (AB + AC + AD + BC + BD + CD) + (ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD) - ABCD\n\nBut since D is the universal set, AD is A, since A is a subset of D. Similarly, BD = B, CD = C, and AD = A, etc. Wait, no, that's not right. Because A, B, C are subsets of D, but their intersections with D would just be themselves. So, AD = A, BD = B, CD = C.\n\nWait, but in the formula, AB is the intersection of A and B, which are subsets of D. So, I think that in this case, the formula simplifies because D is everything. So, the union is D, which is 900.\n\nSo, let me write that:\n\n900 = A + B + C + D - (AB + AC + AD + BC + BD + CD) + (ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD) - ABCD\n\nBut since D is 900, and AD = A (since A is a subset of D), same with BD = B, CD = C.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n900 = A + B + C + 900 - (AB + AC + A + BC + B + C) + (ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD) - ABCD\n\nWait, this seems a bit messy, but maybe I can rearrange terms.\n\nLet me subtract 900 from both sides:\n\n0 = A + B + C - (AB + AC + A + BC + B + C) + (ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD) - ABCD\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\nA + B + C - AB - AC - A - BC - B - C + (ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD) - ABCD\n\nWait, let's combine like terms.\n\nA cancels with -A, B cancels with -B, C cancels with -C.\n\nSo, we're left with:\n\n- AB - AC - BC + (ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD) - ABCD\n\nSo,\n\n0 = - AB - AC - BC + ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD - ABCD\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated, but maybe we can factor some terms. Let me factor:\n\n0 = - (AB + AC + BC) + (ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD) - ABCD\n\nHmm, I'm not sure if this approach is getting me anywhere. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, the problem gives me the number of people owning exactly two and exactly three items. Let me think about how exactly two and exactly three relate to the intersections.\n\nIn inclusion-exclusion, the terms AB, AC, etc., represent the number of people owning both A and B, but not necessarily exactly two. Because some of those might also own C or D. So, perhaps the count for exactly two is AB - ABC - ABD - ACD - BCD + ABCD, but that seems complicated.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that the number of people owning exactly two items is the sum of all pairwise intersections minus three times those who own exactly three, because each exactly three overlaps in three pairwise intersections. Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around.\n\nWait, the number of people owning exactly two items is equal to the sum of all pairwise intersections minus three times the number of people owning exactly three items, because each trio is counted in three pairwise overlaps. Wait, let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for exactly two is:\n\nExactly2 = \u03a3|A\u2229B| - 3\u03a3|A\u2229B\u2229C| + 2\u03a3|A\u2229B\u2229C\u2229D|\n\nWait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nWait, another approach: the total number of people who own at least one item is 900. But since everyone owns D, that's consistent.\n\nLet me think about the counts. The total number of people owning exactly k items can be found using inclusion-exclusion. But perhaps using the formula for exactly two and exactly three.\n\nI know that:\n\n\u03a3|A\u2229B| = sum of all pairwise intersections.\n\nBut each pair includes those who own exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four. So, for example, |A\u2229B| includes those who own exactly A and B, exactly A, B, and C, exactly A, B, C, and D, etc.\n\nWait, so perhaps:\n\n\u03a3|A\u2229B| = Exactly2 + 3*Exactly3 + 6*Exactly4.\n\nWait, why? Because each exactly three owns exactly three items, so for each such person, they are counted in three different pairwise intersections. Similarly, each exactly four person is counted in six pairwise intersections (since there are C(4,2)=6 pairs).\n\nSo, if I have:\n\n\u03a3|A\u2229B| = Exactly2 + 3*Exactly3 + 6*Exactly4.\n\nSimilarly, the sum of all triple intersections \u03a3|A\u2229B\u2229C| would be Exactly3 + 4*Exactly4, because each exactly three is counted once, and each exactly four is counted in four triple intersections.\n\nAnd the four-way intersection |A\u2229B\u2229C\u2229D| is Exactly4.\n\nSo, with that in mind, let me write down the equations.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nE2 = Exactly2 = 437\n\nE3 = Exactly3 = 234\n\nE4 = Exactly4 = ?\n\nE1 = Exactly1 = ?\n\nWe know that the total number of people is E1 + E2 + E3 + E4 = 900.\n\nSo, E1 + 437 + 234 + E4 = 900\n\nWhich gives E1 + E4 = 900 - 671 = 229. So, equation (1): E1 + E4 = 229.\n\nNow, using the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets, but in our case, it's four sets. Wait, perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion formula in terms of exactly k.\n\nWait, another approach: the sum of the sizes of the individual sets (A, B, C, D) is |A| + |B| + |C| + |D|.\n\nBut |D| is 900, since everyone owns D. So, |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900.\n\nWait, that's 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124; 1124 + 900 = 2024.\n\nBut the inclusion-exclusion formula for the union is 900, so:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = 900 = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - \u03a3|A\u2229B| + \u03a3|A\u2229B\u2229C| - |A\u2229B\u2229C\u2229D|\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n900 = 2024 - \u03a3|A\u2229B| + \u03a3|A\u2229B\u2229C| - E4\n\nBut I don't know \u03a3|A\u2229B| or \u03a3|A\u2229B\u2229C|. Hmm.\n\nWait, but from earlier, I have:\n\n\u03a3|A\u2229B| = E2 + 3E3 + 6E4\n\nAnd \u03a3|A\u2229B\u2229C| = E3 + 4E4\n\nSo, substituting these into the equation:\n\n900 = 2024 - (E2 + 3E3 + 6E4) + (E3 + 4E4) - E4\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n2024 - E2 -3E3 -6E4 + E3 +4E4 - E4\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2024 - E2 -2E3 -3E4\n\nSo,\n\n900 = 2024 - E2 -2E3 -3E4\n\nNow, rearranging:\n\nE2 + 2E3 + 3E4 = 2024 - 900 = 1124\n\nWe know E2 = 437, E3 = 234.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n437 + 2*234 + 3E4 = 1124\n\nCalculate 2*234 = 468.\n\nSo,\n\n437 + 468 + 3E4 = 1124\n\n437 + 468 is 905.\n\nSo,\n\n905 + 3E4 = 1124\n\nSubtract 905:\n\n3E4 = 1124 - 905 = 219\n\nSo,\n\nE4 = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, E4 is 73.\n\nLet me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Calculated the sum of individual sets: 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024.\n\n2. The inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets: 900 = 2024 - (\u03a3|A\u2229B|) + (\u03a3|A\u2229B\u2229C|) - |A\u2229B\u2229C\u2229D|.\n\n3. Expressed \u03a3|A\u2229B| as E2 + 3E3 + 6E4.\n\n4. Expressed \u03a3|A\u2229B\u2229C| as E3 + 4E4.\n\n5. Substituted these into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\n900 = 2024 - (E2 +3E3 +6E4) + (E3 +4E4) - E4.\n\nSimplify: 2024 - E2 -3E3 -6E4 + E3 +4E4 - E4.\n\nWhich becomes 2024 - E2 -2E3 -3E4.\n\nThen:\n\n900 = 2024 - (437 + 2*234 + 3E4).\n\nWait, no, actually, when I rearrange:\n\nE2 + 2E3 + 3E4 = 2024 - 900 = 1124.\n\nThen substituting E2=437, E3=234:\n\n437 + 468 +3E4=1124.\n\nTotal of 437+468=905, so 3E4=219, so E4=73.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the number of residents who own all four things is 73.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. There are four items: diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and candy hearts. Each resident owns at least a bag of candy hearts, which means everyone has at least one of these four. The question is asking how many residents own all four of these items. \n\nLet me try to break this down. First, I know that all 900 residents own a bag of candy hearts. So, the universal set here is 900 people. The other three items\u2014diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades\u2014are owned by 195, 367, and 562 residents respectively. \n\nWait, but the problem also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, I need to use this information to find out how many own all four. \n\nHmm, I think this is a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. That's the one where you calculate the total number of elements in multiple sets by adding them up and then subtracting the overlaps, right? But I'm not entirely sure how to apply it here because we're dealing with exactly two and exactly three, not just the overlaps.\n\nLet me recall the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets. The formula for the union of four sets A, B, C, D is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |A\u2229D| - |B\u2229C| - |B\u2229D| - |C\u2229D| + |A\u2229B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229D| + |A\u2229C\u2229D| + |B\u2229C\u2229D| - |A\u2229B\u2229C\u2229D|\n\nBut wait, in this problem, everyone owns at least one thing, and that thing is the candy hearts. So, the union of all four sets should be equal to 900. So, |A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = 900.\n\nBut I'm given the numbers for each individual set: |A| is 195 (diamond rings), |B| is 367 (golf clubs), |C| is 562 (garden spades), and |D| is 900 (candy hearts). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so D is actually the entire set. So, all residents are in D. So, the union is D, which is 900. So, |A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = |D| = 900.\n\nSo, the inclusion-exclusion formula simplifies because D is the universal set. Let me write that again:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nBut wait, in this case, since D is the universal set, and we're considering the union of A, B, C, and D as 900, which is the same as the union of A, B, and C because D already includes everyone. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the problem using the inclusion-exclusion principle for exactly two and exactly three overlaps. The problem gives me the number of people who own exactly two of the four things (437) and exactly three (234). I need to relate this to the total number of people.\n\nLet me think about the standard inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets, but here we have four. Wait, perhaps I should model it as the total number of people owning at least one item is 900. But since everyone owns candy hearts, the total is 900.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the counts for each category: exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, exactly four. The problem doesn't directly give me the number of people with exactly one, but I can calculate it.\n\nWait, the problem says 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. So, the remaining would be the ones who own exactly one and exactly four. But wait, the total is 900, so:\n\nTotal = Exactly1 + Exactly2 + Exactly3 + Exactly4.\n\nSo, Exactly1 + 437 + 234 + Exactly4 = 900.\n\nSo, Exactly1 + Exactly4 = 900 - (437 + 234) = 900 - 671 = 229.\n\nSo, Exactly1 + Exactly4 = 229.\n\nBut I don't know exactly what Exactly1 is. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets. Let me try that.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nTotal = A + B + C + D - (AB + AC + AD + BC + BD + CD) + (ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD) - ABCD\n\nBut in this case, D is 900, since everyone owns candy hearts. So, D is the universal set. So, the union of A, B, C, D is 900. So, the formula becomes:\n\n900 = A + B + C + D - (AB + AC + AD + BC + BD + CD) + (ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD) - ABCD\n\nBut since D is the universal set, AD is A, since A is a subset of D. Similarly, BD = B, CD = C, and AD = A, etc. Wait, no, that's not right. Because A, B, C are subsets of D, but their intersections with D would just be themselves. So, AD = A, BD = B, CD = C.\n\nWait, but in the formula, AB is the intersection of A and B, which are subsets of D. So, I think that in this case, the formula simplifies because D is everything. So, the union is D, which is 900.\n\nSo, let me write that:\n\n900 = A + B + C + D - (AB + AC + AD + BC + BD + CD) + (ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD) - ABCD\n\nBut since D is 900, and AD = A (since A is a subset of D), same with BD = B, CD = C.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n900 = A + B + C + 900 - (AB + AC + A + BC + B + C) + (ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD) - ABCD\n\nWait, this seems a bit messy, but maybe I can rearrange terms.\n\nLet me subtract 900 from both sides:\n\n0 = A + B + C - (AB + AC + A + BC + B + C) + (ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD) - ABCD\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\nA + B + C - AB - AC - A - BC - B - C + (ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD) - ABCD\n\nWait, let's combine like terms.\n\nA cancels with -A, B cancels with -B, C cancels with -C.\n\nSo, we're left with:\n\n- AB - AC - BC + (ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD) - ABCD\n\nSo,\n\n0 = - AB - AC - BC + ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD - ABCD\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated, but maybe we can factor some terms. Let me factor:\n\n0 = - (AB + AC + BC) + (ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD) - ABCD\n\nHmm, I'm not sure if this approach is getting me anywhere.

Let me consider that the number of people owning exactly two items is the sum of all pairwise intersections minus three times those who own exactly three, because each exactly three overlaps in three pairwise intersections. Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around.\n\nWait, the number of people owning exactly two items is equal to the sum of all pairwise intersections minus three times the number of people owning exactly three items, because each trio is counted in three pairwise overlaps. Wait, let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for exactly two is:\n\nExactly2 = \u03a3|A\u2229B| - 3\u03a3|A\u2229B\u2229C| + 2\u03a3|A\u2229B\u2229C\u2229D|\n\nWait, I'm not sure.

So, for example, |A\u2229B| includes those who own exactly A and B, exactly A, B, and C, exactly A, B, C, and D, etc.\n\nWait, so perhaps:\n\n\u03a3|A\u2229B| = Exactly2 + 3*Exactly3 + 6*Exactly4.\n\nWait, why? Because each exactly three owns exactly three items, so for each such person, they are counted in three different pairwise intersections. Similarly, each exactly four person is counted in six pairwise intersections (since there are C(4,2)=6 pairs).\n\nSo, if I have:\n\n\u03a3|A\u2229B| = Exactly2 + 3*Exactly3 + 6*Exactly4.\n\nSimilarly, the sum of all triple intersections \u03a3|A\u2229B\u2229C| would be Exactly3 + 4*Exactly4, because each exactly three is counted once, and each exactly four is counted in four triple intersections.\n\nAnd the four-way intersection |A\u2229B\u2229C\u2229D| is Exactly4.\n\nSo, with that in mind, let me write down the equations.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nE2 = Exactly2 = 437\n\nE3 = Exactly3 = 234\n\nE4 = Exactly4 = ?\n\nE1 = Exactly1 = ?\n\nWe know that the total number of people is E1 + E2 + E3 + E4 = 900.\n\nSo, E1 + 437 + 234 + E4 = 900\n\nWhich gives E1 + E4 = 900 - 671 = 229. So, equation (1): E1 + E4 = 229.\n\nNow, using the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets, but in our case, it's four sets. Wait, perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion formula in terms of exactly k.\n\nWait, another approach: the sum of the sizes of the individual sets (A, B, C, D) is |A| + |B| + |C| + |D|.\n\nBut |D| is 900, since everyone owns D. So, |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900.\n\nWait, that's 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124; 1124 + 900 = 2024.\n\nBut the inclusion-exclusion formula for the union is 900, so:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D| = 900 = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - \u03a3|A\u2229B| + \u03a3|A\u2229B\u2229C| - |A\u2229B\u2229C\u2229D|\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n900 = 2024 - \u03a3|A\u2229B| + \u03a3|A\u2229B\u2229C| - E4\n\nBut I don't know \u03a3|A\u2229B| or \u03a3|A\u2229B\u2229C|.

Substituted these into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\n900 = 2024 - (E2 +3E3 +6E4) + (E3 +4E4) - E4.\n\nSimplify: 2024 - E2 -3E3 -6E4 + E3 +4E4 - E4.\n\nWhich becomes 2024 - E2 -2E3 -3E4.\n\nThen:\n\n900 = 2024 - (437 + 2*234 + 3E4).\n\nWait, no, actually, when I rearrange:\n\nE2 + 2E3 + 3E4 = 2024 - 900 = 1124.\n\nThen substituting E2=437, E3=234:\n\n437 + 468 +3E4=1124.\n\nTotal of 437+468=905, so 3E4=219, so E4=73.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the number of residents who own all four things is 73.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of residents in Aimeville who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Given that each of the 900 residents owns at least a bag of candy hearts, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve the problem.\n\nFirst, we know:\n- Total residents: 900\n- Residents owning exactly two items: 437\n- Residents owning exactly three items: 234\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets, we express the total number of residents as the sum of those owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four items:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total} = \\text{Exactly1} + \\text{Exactly2} + \\text{Exactly3} + \\text{Exactly4} \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[ 900 = \\text{Exactly1} + 437 + 234 + \\text{Exactly4} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Exactly1} + \\text{Exactly4} = 900 - (437 + 234) = 229 \\]\n\nNext, we use the inclusion-exclusion formula for the union of four sets:\n\\[ 900 = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - \\sum|A \\cap B| + \\sum|A \\cap B \\cap C| - |A \\cap B \\cap C \\cap D| \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n- \\( |A| = 195 \\), \\( |B| = 367 \\), \\( |C| = 562 \\), \\( |D| = 900 \\)\n- \\( \\sum|A \\cap B| = \\text{Exactly2} + 3 \\times \\text{Exactly3} + 6 \\times \\text{Exactly4} \\)\n- \\( \\sum|A \\cap B \\cap C| = \\text{Exactly3} + 4 \\times \\text{Exactly4} \\)\n- \\( |A \\cap B \\cap C \\cap D| = \\text{Exactly4} \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\\[ 900 = 2024 - (437 + 3 \\times 234 + 6 \\times \\text{Exactly4}) + (234 + 4 \\times \\text{Exactly4}) - \\text{Exactly4} \\]\n\\[ 900 = 2024 - 437 - 602 - 6 \\times \\text{Exactly4} + 234 + 4 \\times \\text{Exactly4} - \\text{Exactly4} \\]\n\\[ 900 = 2024 - 1071 - 3 \\times \\text{Exactly4} \\]\n\\[ 3 \\times \\text{Exactly4} = 2024 - 900 - 1071 = 219 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Exactly4} = \\frac{219}{3} = 73 \\]\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four items is:\n\n\\boxed{73}",
