      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on a hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So basically, I have to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi, which would be the maximum lower bound for BD\u00b2.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of rhombuses. In a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, no, wait, I think that in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. No, wait, actually, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Because in a rhombus, the sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect the angles and are perpendicular. Yeah, that's correct. So, in this case, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.\n\nSo, given that, the points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and the diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin. So, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and points B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal.\n\nGiven that, if O is the origin, then OA = OC and OB = OD, because the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, coordinates of A and C are negatives of each other, same with B and D.\n\nWait, but in a hyperbola, points are symmetric about both axes. So, if A is (x,y), then C would be (-x,-y). Similarly, if B is (u,v), then D would be (-u,-v). But since it's a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA must all be equal in length.\n\nWait, but in our case, the diagonals intersect at the origin, so the diagonals are AC and BD, and they are perpendicular. Also, the sides are equal. So, perhaps we can model this by considering points A and C on one diagonal, and B and D on the other.\n\nBut since the hyperbola is symmetric, maybe I can parametrize points A and B in terms of parameters, and enforce the rhombus conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that point A is (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, point B is (u, v), and point D is (-u, -v). So, the four points of the rhombus are (x,y), (u,v), (-x,-y), (-u,-v). Wait, but that would make a rectangle unless the sides are equal and the angles are not 90 degrees, but in a rhombus, sides are equal but angles can vary.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the sides are equal, so the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, etc.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to represent points in terms of vectors. Let me think of vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, vectors OA and OC are negatives, same with OB and OD. So, the rhombus is formed by points A, B, C, D with vectors OA, OB, OC, OD. Since the diagonals are AC and BD, which are vectors 2OA and 2OB. Wait, no, the diagonals are AC which is OA - OC = 2 OA, and BD which is OB - OD = 2 OB. Hmm, maybe not exactly.\n\nWait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are vectors that are the sum and difference of the vectors from the origin. Wait, perhaps if I have vectors a and b from the origin, then the diagonals would be a + b and a - b. But in our case, since the diagonals are AC and BD, which are vectors from A to C and from B to D. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Let me denote vector OA as vector a, so point A is (a_x, a_y). Then, point C is (-a_x, -a_y). Similarly, vector OB is vector b, so point B is (b_x, b_y) and point D is (-b_x, -b_y). So, the rhombus is formed by the four points A, B, C, D.\n\nBut in a rhombus, the sides are equal, so the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, and so on.\n\nWait, but the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA.\n\nSo, computing the distance AB: sqrt[(b_x - a_x)^2 + (b_y - a_y)^2]\n\nDistance BC: sqrt[(-x - b_x)^2 + (-y - b_y)^2] but wait, point C is (-a_x, -a_y), so actually, distance BC is sqrt[(-a_x - b_x)^2 + (-a_y - b_y)^2]\n\nSimilarly, distance CD is sqrt[(-a_x - (-b_x))^2 + (-a_y - (-b_y))^2] = sqrt[(b_x - a_x)^2 + (b_y - a_y)^2]\n\nSimilarly, DA is sqrt[(a_x - (-b_x))^2 + (a_y - (-b_y))^2] = sqrt[(a_x + b_x)^2 + (a_y + b_y)^2]\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nFrom the expressions above, AB = sqrt[(b_x - a_x)^2 + (b_y - a_y)^2]\n\nBC = sqrt[( -a_x - b_x)^2 + (-a_y - b_y)^2] = sqrt[(a_x + b_x)^2 + (a_y + b_y)^2]\n\nSo, for AB = BC, we have:\n\nsqrt[(b_x - a_x)^2 + (b_y - a_y)^2] = sqrt[(a_x + b_x)^2 + (a_y + b_y)^2]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(b_x - a_x)^2 + (b_y - a_y)^2 = (a_x + b_x)^2 + (a_y + b_y)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n(b_x^2 - 2 a_x b_x + a_x^2) + (b_y^2 - 2 a_y b_y + a_y^2) = (a_x^2 + 2 a_x b_x + b_x^2) + (a_y^2 + 2 a_y b_y + b_y^2)\n\nSimplify:\n\nLeft side: b_x\u00b2 - 2 a_x b_x + a_x\u00b2 + b_y\u00b2 - 2 a_y b_y + a_y\u00b2\n\nRight side: a_x\u00b2 + 2 a_x b_x + b_x\u00b2 + a_y\u00b2 + 2 a_y b_y + b_y\u00b2\n\nSubtract left side from right side:\n\n[ a_x\u00b2 + 2 a_x b_x + b_x\u00b2 + a_y\u00b2 + 2 a_y b_y + b_y\u00b2 ] - [ b_x\u00b2 - 2 a_x b_x + a_x\u00b2 + b_y\u00b2 - 2 a_y b_y + a_y\u00b2 ] \n\n= (a_x\u00b2 - a_x\u00b2) + (b_x\u00b2 - b_x\u00b2) + (a_y\u00b2 - a_y\u00b2) + (b_y\u00b2 - b_y\u00b2) + 2 a_x b_x + 2 a_y b_y + 2 a_x b_x + 2 a_y b_y\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute it correctly.\n\nWait, subtracting left side from right side:\n\n(a_x\u00b2 + 2 a_x b_x + b_x\u00b2 + a_y\u00b2 + 2 a_y b_y + b_y\u00b2) - (b_x\u00b2 - 2 a_x b_x + a_x\u00b2 + b_y\u00b2 - 2 a_y b_y + a_y\u00b2 )\n\n= (a_x\u00b2 - a_x\u00b2) + (2 a_x b_x + 2 a_x b_x) + (b_x\u00b2 - b_x\u00b2) + (a_y\u00b2 - a_y\u00b2) + (2 a_y b_y + 2 a_y b_y) + (b_y\u00b2 - b_y\u00b2)\n\nSo, simplifying:\n\n0 + 4 a_x b_x + 0 + 0 + 4 a_y b_y + 0 = 4 a_x b_x + 4 a_y b_y\n\nSo, this difference is 4(a_x b_x + a_y b_y) = 0.\n\nTherefore, 4(a_x b_x + a_y b_y) = 0\n\nWhich implies that a_x b_x + a_y b_y = 0.\n\nSo, the dot product of vectors OA and OB is zero. That means OA and OB are perpendicular vectors.\n\nAh, so vectors OA and OB are perpendicular. That's an important condition. So, points A and B must lie such that OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nSo, that's one condition. So, in our problem, OA \u00b7 OB = 0.\n\nAnother condition is that all four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, points A(a_x, a_y) and B(b_x, b_y) must satisfy:\n\na_x\u00b2 / 20 - a_y\u00b2 / 24 = 1\n\nb_x\u00b2 / 20 - b_y\u00b2 / 24 = 1\n\nAnd OA \u00b7 OB = a_x b_x + a_y b_y = 0.\n\nAlso, since ABCD is a rhombus, sides are equal. We found that AB = BC, but we need to ensure that all sides are equal.\n\nWait, but if OA and OB are perpendicular, and lengths OA and OB are such that OA and OB are vectors from the origin, then perhaps the rhombus is determined by these vectors.\n\nWait, but in that case, the rhombus would have sides equal to sqrt(OA\u00b2 + OB\u00b2). Because in a rhombus formed by two perpendicular vectors OA and OB, each side is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs OA and OB. So, the length of each side is sqrt(OA\u00b2 + OB\u00b2). But in our case, OA and OB are vectors, but the sides are AB, BC, etc. Wait, perhaps that's a different way to model it.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If OA and OB are vectors from the origin and OA \u00b7 OB = 0, then the points A, B, C, D form a rhombus where the diagonals are AC and BD, with midpoints at the origin.\n\nWait, but in this case, the diagonals are AC and BD, which are vectors 2 OA and 2 OB. Because A is a, C is -a, so AC is a - (-a) = 2a. Similarly, BD is b - (-b) = 2b. So, the lengths of the diagonals are 2|OA| and 2|OB|.\n\nBut in a rhombus, the area can be given by (d1 * d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. Also, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the area can also be given by |OA \u00d7 OB| * 2, because OA and OB are perpendicular. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the property that in a rhombus, the sum of the squares of the diagonals equals four times the sum of the squares of the sides. Wait, is that correct? Let me recall: in a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy the relation (d1)^2 + (d2)^2 = 4 (side)^2.\n\nBut in our case, the diagonals are AC and BD, which are 2|OA| and 2|OB|. So, AC = 2|OA|, BD = 2|OB|.\n\nSo, (AC)^2 + (BD)^2 = 4 (OA)^2 + 4 (OB)^2.\n\nBut, since OA and OB are perpendicular, the sides of the rhombus are equal to sqrt( (OA)^2 + (OB)^2 ). Wait, no, because if you have vectors OA and OB, the sides of the rhombus would be OA + OB, but in our case, the sides are AB, BC, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the length AB.\n\nPoint A is (a_x, a_y), point B is (b_x, b_y). So, AB distance is sqrt( (a_x - b_x)^2 + (a_y - b_y)^2 )\n\nBut since OA \u00b7 OB = 0, which is a_x b_x + a_y b_y = 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express this in terms of |OA| and |OB|.\n\nLet me denote |OA| = p, |OB| = q. Then, since OA and OB are perpendicular, the area of the rhombus is 2 p q. Because the area is (d1*d2)/2, which would be (2p * 2q)/2 = 2 p q.\n\nAlso, the sides of the rhombus are equal, so each side is sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), because in a rhombus with perpendicular diagonals, each side is sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 ) = sqrt( (p)^2 + (q)^2 ).\n\nWait, let me think again. If the diagonals are 2p and 2q, and they are perpendicular, then each half-diagonal is p and q, so each side is sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, yes, the sides are sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nBut in our case, the sides are also the distance between A and B, which is sqrt( (a_x - b_x)^2 + (a_y - b_y)^2 ). So, if OA \u00b7 OB = 0, then:\n\n(a_x - b_x)^2 + (a_y - b_y)^2 = (a_x + b_x)^2 + (a_y + b_y)^2 - 4 (a_x b_x + a_y b_y)\n\nWait, no, that seems messy.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the condition that OA and OB are perpendicular, and points A and B lie on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, the idea is that we have four points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola forming a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. So, OA and OB are perpendicular vectors, and points A and B lie on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, our goal is to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is (2 q)^2 = 4 q\u00b2, where q is |OB|. So, we need to minimize BD\u00b2, which is 4 q\u00b2, over all possible such rhombi.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to minimizing 4 q\u00b2, given that points A and B lie on the hyperbola and OA is perpendicular to OB.\n\nBut we can note that since OA \u00b7 OB = 0, and both points lie on the hyperbola, we can parametrize points A and B in terms of some parameters.\n\nLet me think of parametrizing points on the hyperbola. The hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, we can write parametric equations for points on this hyperbola.\n\nFor hyperbola, a standard parametrization is (a sec \u03b8, b tan \u03b8), where a\u00b2 = 20 and b\u00b2 = 24. So, a = sqrt(20) = 2 sqrt(5), and b = sqrt(24) = 2 sqrt(6).\n\nSo, point A can be parametrized as (2 sqrt(5) sec \u03b8, 2 sqrt(6) tan \u03b8). Similarly, point B would be on the hyperbola as well, but since OA and OB are perpendicular, perhaps we can find a relation between the parameters \u03b8 and \u03c6 for points A and B.\n\nWait, but if OA \u00b7 OB = 0, then (2 sqrt(5) sec \u03b8)(2 sqrt(5) sec \u03c6) + (2 sqrt(6) tan \u03b8)(2 sqrt(6) tan \u03c6) = 0\n\nWait, let me compute OA \u00b7 OB.\n\nOA \u00b7 OB = (2 sqrt(5) sec \u03b8)(2 sqrt(5) sec \u03c6) + (2 sqrt(6) tan \u03b8)(2 sqrt(6) tan \u03c6)\n\n= (4 * 5) sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 + (4 * 6) tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6\n\n= 20 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 + 24 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6 = 0\n\nSo,\n\n20 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 + 24 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6 = 0\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n20 / (cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6) + 24 (sin \u03b8 / cos \u03b8)(sin \u03c6 / cos \u03c6) = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6:\n\n20 + 24 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = 0\n\nSo,\n\n24 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -20\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n6 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5\n\nSo,\n\nsin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6\n\nHmm, this is an equation involving \u03b8 and \u03c6. So, our next step is to find \u03b8 and \u03c6 such that this holds.\n\nWe need to find sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nThe goal is to find BD\u00b2, which is (2 |OB| )\u00b2 = 4 |OB|\u00b2. Since |OB|\u00b2 is (2 sqrt(5) sec \u03c6)^2 + (2 sqrt(6) tan \u03c6)^2.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, point B is parametrized as (2 sqrt(5) sec \u03c6, 2 sqrt(6) tan \u03c6). So, |OB|\u00b2 is (2 sqrt(5) sec \u03c6)^2 + (2 sqrt(6) tan \u03c6)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n= (4 * 5) sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + (4 * 6) tan\u00b2 \u03c6\n\n= 20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 |OB|\u00b2 = 4*(20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6)\n\nWait, no, BD is the diagonal from B to D, which is 2 |OB|, so BD\u00b2 is (2 |OB|)^2 = 4 |OB|\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 = 4*(20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6) = 80 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 96 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, our goal is to minimize BD\u00b2 = 80 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 + 96 tan\u00b2 \u03c6, given that sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6, where point A is (2 sqrt(5) sec \u03b8, 2 sqrt(6) tan \u03b8) and point B is (2 sqrt(5) sec \u03c6, 2 sqrt(6) tan \u03c6).\n\nBut since we have a relationship between \u03b8 and \u03c6, perhaps we can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute.\n\nWait, but sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWe can express sin \u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin \u03c6).\n\nBut sin \u03b8 is bounded between -1 and 1, so |(-5)/(6 sin \u03c6)| \u2264 1 => |5/(6 sin \u03c6)| \u22641 => |sin \u03c6| \u2265 5/6.\n\nSo, |sin \u03c6| \u2265 5/6.\n\nWhich implies that \u03c6 is in a region where sin \u03c6 is at least 5/6 or at most -5/6.\n\nSimilarly, since sin \u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin \u03c6), if sin \u03c6 is positive, sin \u03b8 is negative, and vice versa.\n\nSo, we can express sin \u03b8 in terms of sin \u03c6, but I'm not sure yet how that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find expressions in terms of \u03c6 and then find the minimal value.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to consider that points A and B lie on the hyperbola and OA is perpendicular to OB. So, if I can express this condition in terms of coordinates, maybe I can find a relation between x and y.\n\nSuppose point A is (x, y) on hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nThen point B is another point (u, v) on the same hyperbola, such that OA \u00b7 OB = 0, i.e., x u + y v = 0.\n\nSo, the problem becomes, given (x, y) and (u, v) on the hyperbola, x u + y v = 0. We need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2, which is 4 (u\u00b2 + v\u00b2), because |OB|\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + v\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, point B is (u, v), so |OB|\u00b2 is u\u00b2 + v\u00b2. Therefore, BD\u00b2 = 4 (u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). So, we need to minimize 4 (u\u00b2 + v\u00b2), given that (u, v) is on the hyperbola, and that x u + y v =0, with (x, y) also on the hyperbola.\n\nBut since the rhombus can vary, perhaps I can fix point A and then find point B, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use Lagrange multipliers. Let me consider that.\n\nWe need to minimize f(u, v) = 4 (u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)\n\nSubject to two constraints:\n\ng(u, v) = u\u00b2 /20 - v\u00b2 /24 -1 =0\n\nand\n\nh(u, v) = x u + y v =0\n\nBut x and y are also variables on the hyperbola, so perhaps this complicates things. Maybe instead, I can parametrize the problem differently.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to consider that since OA and OB are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nSo, if point A is (x, y), then the slope of OA is y/x.\n\nPoint B is (u, v), so the slope of OB is v/u.\n\nSince OA is perpendicular to OB, (y/x) * (v/u) = -1.\n\nWhich implies y v = -x u.\n\nWhich is the same as x u + y v =0, which matches our previous condition.\n\nSo, the condition is x u + y v =0.\n\nSo, given that both (x, y) and (u, v) lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nNow, perhaps I can express u and v in terms of x and y.\n\nFrom x u + y v =0, we can express v = (-x u)/y.\n\nSubstitute into the hyperbola equation for point B:\n\nu\u00b2 /20 - v\u00b2 /24 =1\n\nSubstituting v:\n\nu\u00b2 /20 - [ (x\u00b2 u\u00b2 ) / y\u00b2 ] /24 =1\n\nFactor u\u00b2:\n\nu\u00b2 [ 1/20 - x\u00b2 / (24 y\u00b2 ) ] =1\n\nLet me compute the coefficient inside the brackets:\n\n1/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) = [ (24 y\u00b2) - 20 x\u00b2 ] / (20 * 24 y\u00b2 )\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2 * (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2) / (480 y\u00b2 ) =1\n\nTherefore,\n\nu\u00b2 = [480 y\u00b2 ] / (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, since point A is on the hyperbola, x\u00b2 /20 - y\u00b2 /24 =1 => 24 x\u00b2 - 20 y\u00b2 = 240.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nx\u00b2 /20 - y\u00b2 /24 =1 => multiply both sides by 24*20=480:\n\n24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 = 480.\n\nSo,\n\n24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 = 480.\n\nLet me compute 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2:\n\n= - (20 x\u00b2 -24 y\u00b2 )\n\n= - [20 x\u00b2 -24 y\u00b2 ]\n\nBut 24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 =480, so 20 x\u00b2 -24 y\u00b2 = - (24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 ) + 4 x\u00b2 - 4 y\u00b2 ?\n\nWait, maybe it's better to compute 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 = - (20 x\u00b2 -24 y\u00b2 )\n\nAnd from 24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 =480, perhaps I can express 20 x\u00b2 -24 y\u00b2 = -480 * (something).\n\nWait, perhaps I can express 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 = - (20 x\u00b2 -24 y\u00b2 ) = - (20 x\u00b2 -24 y\u00b2 )\n\nBut 24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 = 480 => 20 x\u00b2 = 24 x\u00b2 -480.\n\nWait, no, let's solve for x\u00b2:\n\nFrom 24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 =480,\n\n24 x\u00b2 = 20 y\u00b2 +480,\n\nx\u00b2 = (20 y\u00b2 +480)/24 = (5 y\u00b2 + 120)/6.\n\nSimilarly, we can express y\u00b2 from the hyperbola equation.\n\nBut maybe that's not the most helpful.\n\nLooking back at u\u00b2 expression:\n\nu\u00b2 = [480 y\u00b2 ] / (24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute denominator:\n\n24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 = 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2.\n\nFrom hyperbola equation, 24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 =480.\n\nSo,\n\n24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 = - (20 x\u00b2 -24 y\u00b2 ) = - [ (24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 ) -40 y\u00b2 ].\n\nWait, perhaps a different approach.\n\nLet me compute 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2 = 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2.\n\nFrom 24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 =480, so 24 x\u00b2 =20 y\u00b2 +480.\n\nLet me divide both sides by 20:\n\n(24/20) x\u00b2 = y\u00b2 + 24.\n\nWhich is (6/5) x\u00b2 = y\u00b2 +24.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = (6/5) x\u00b2 -24.\n\nNow, substituting into 24 y\u00b2 -20 x\u00b2:\n\n=24 [ (6/5 x\u00b2 -24 ) ] -20 x\u00b2\n\n=24*(6/5 x\u00b2) -24*24 -20 x\u00b2\n\n= (144/5) x\u00b2 - 576 -20 x\u00b2\n\n= (144/5 -100/5) x\u00b2 -576\n\n= (44/5) x\u00b2 -576\n\nSo, denominator becomes (44/5) x\u00b2 -576.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 = [480 y\u00b2 ] / ( (44/5) x\u00b2 -576 )\n\nBut y\u00b2 is (6/5) x\u00b2 -24, so:\n\nu\u00b2 = [480 * (6/5 x\u00b2 -24) ] / ( (44/5 x\u00b2 -576 ) )\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 480*(6/5 x\u00b2 -24 ) = 480*(6/5 x\u00b2 ) -480*24 = (480*6/5)x\u00b2 - 11520 = 576 x\u00b2 -11520\n\nDenominator: (44/5 x\u00b2 -576 ) = (44 x\u00b2 -2880)/5\n\nSo, u\u00b2 = (576 x\u00b2 -11520 ) / [ (44 x\u00b2 -2880)/5 ] = 5*(576 x\u00b2 -11520 )/(44 x\u00b2 -2880 )\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 5*(576 x\u00b2 -11520 ) =5*576(x\u00b2 -20 ) = 2880 (x\u00b2 -20 )\n\nDenominator: 44 x\u00b2 -2880 =4*11 x\u00b2 -2880 = doesn't factor as nicely, but perhaps we can factor 4:\n\n=4(11 x\u00b2 -720 )\n\nSo, u\u00b2 = [2880 (x\u00b2 -20 ) ] / [4 (11 x\u00b2 -720 ) ] = [720 (x\u00b2 -20 ) ] / (11 x\u00b2 -720 )\n\nSo, u\u00b2 = [720 (x\u00b2 -20 ) ] / (11 x\u00b2 -720 )\n\nSo, since u\u00b2 must be positive, the denominator and numerator must have the same sign.\n\nSo,\n\nCase 1: Both numerator and denominator positive.\n\nSo,\n\n720 (x\u00b2 -20 ) >0 ==> x\u00b2 >20\n\nAnd,\n\n11 x\u00b2 -720 >0 ==> x\u00b2 >720/11 \u224865.45\n\nCase 2: Both numerator and denominator negative.\n\n720 (x\u00b2 -20 ) <0 ==> x\u00b2 <20\n\nAnd,\n\n11 x\u00b2 -720 <0 ==> x\u00b2 <720/11\u224865.45\n\nBut since x\u00b2 must satisfy the hyperbola equation, which is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1, so x\u00b2 \u226520.\n\nSo, in our case, x\u00b2 \u226520.\n\nTherefore, we are in case 1 where x\u00b2 >720/11\u224865.45.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 is positive only if x\u00b2 >720/11\u224865.45.\n\nSo, from this, x\u00b2 must be greater than 720/11\u224865.45.\n\nSo, that gives a constraint on x.\n\nTherefore, u\u00b2 = [720 (x\u00b2 -20 ) ] / (11 x\u00b2 -720 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nFactor numerator and denominator.\n\n720 = 72*10= 8*9*10\n\n11 x\u00b2 -720 =11 x\u00b2 -720\n\nNot much to factor, so perhaps express u\u00b2 in terms of x\u00b2.\n\nLet me denote t = x\u00b2, then t \u226520.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 = [720(t -20)] / (11 t -720 )\n\nSo, u\u00b2 = [720 (t -20) ] / (11 t -720 )\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nu\u00b2 = [720 (t -20) ] / (11 t -720 )\n\nWe can simplify this expression.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nu\u00b2 = [720(t -20)] / (11 t -720 ) = [720(t -20)] / [11 t -720]\n\nWe can factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 720(t-20)\n\nDenominator: 11 t -720\n\nWe can write denominator as 11 t -720 =11(t) -720.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor 720 as 11*65.45, but exact value is 720/11\u224865.45.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps perform polynomial division.\n\nWait, let me compute 720(t -20) divided by (11 t -720):\n\nLet me write numerator as 720 t -14400.\n\nDenominator:11 t -720.\n\nLet me see how many times 11 t goes into 720 t.\n\n720 /11 \u224865.45 times.\n\nSo, 720 t = (720/11)(11 t) =720/11*(11 t)=720/11*(denominator +720 -720)??? Wait, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perform division:\n\nDivide 720 t -14400 by 11 t -720.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nDividend: 720 t -14400\n\nDivisor:11 t -720\n\nSo, first term: (720 t)/(11 t)=720/11.\n\nMultiply divisor by 720/11:\n\n720/11*(11 t -720 )=720 t - (720 *720)/11\n\nSubtract this from dividend:\n\n(720 t -14400 ) - (720 t - (720*720)/11 )= 0 t + [ -14400 + (720*720)/11 ]\n\nCompute the constant term:\n\n(720*720)=518400\n\n518400 /11 \u224847127.27\n\nSo,\n\n-14400 +47127.27\u224832727.27\n\nSo, the division gives:\n\n720/11 + [32727.27]/(11 t -720 )\n\nWait, but this seems messy, perhaps not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express u\u00b2 as:\n\nu\u00b2 = [720(t-20)] / (11 t -720 )= [720(t-20)] / (11 t -720 )\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nu\u00b2 = [720(t -20)] / (11(t - 720/11 ) )\n\n= [720/11]*(t -20)/(t -720/11 )\n\nHmm, that's a better way.\n\nLet me compute 720/11 \u224865.45.\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2 = (720/11)*(t -20)/(t -720/11 )\n\nSo, that's a constant times (t -20)/(t -720/11 )\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nu\u00b2 = (720/11) * [ (t -20) / (t -720/11) ]\n\nLet me write 720/11 as 65.4545 approximately.\n\nSo, let me denote s = t -720/11.\n\nThen, t = s +720/11.\n\nSo,\n\n(t -20 ) = s +720/11 -20 = s + (720/11 - 220/11 )=s + (500/11 )\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2 = (720/11 ) * [ (s +500/11 ) / s ]\n\n= (720/11 ) * [1 + (500/11)/s ]\n\n= (720/11 ) + (720/11 )*(500/11)/s\n\n= (720/11 ) + (720*500)/(121 s )\n\nBut s = t -720/11 =x\u00b2 -720/11.\n\nSo, as x\u00b2 increases beyond720/11, s increases.\n\nTherefore, as s approaches infinity, u\u00b2 approaches 720/11.\n\nBut when s approaches zero from the positive side, since x\u00b2 >720/11, s is positive, and u\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 can be written as:\n\nu\u00b2 = (720/11 ) + (720*500)/(121 s )\n\nWhich is:\n\nu\u00b2 = (720/11 ) + (360000)/(121 s )\n\nSince s =x\u00b2 -720/11 >0, we can write:\n\nu\u00b2 = (720/11 ) + (360000)/(121 (x\u00b2 -720/11 ) )\n\nSo, as x\u00b2 increases, (x\u00b2 -720/11 ) increases, so the second term becomes smaller, and u\u00b2 approaches 720/11 from above.\n\nSo, the minimal value of u\u00b2 is 720/11, but it can't actually reach that because s can't be infinity. So, the infimum of u\u00b2 is 720/11. Therefore, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 4 u\u00b2, which would have infimum 4*(720/11 )=2880/11\u2248261.818.\n\nWait, but wait, is this correct? Because u\u00b2 can approach 720/11 as x\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWait, as x\u00b2 \u2192 \u221e, then s =x\u00b2 -720/11 \u2192 \u221e, so the second term (360000)/(121 s ) approaches zero, and u\u00b2 approaches 720/11.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 =4 u\u00b2 approaches 4*(720/11 )=2880/11\u2248261.818.\n\nBut we need to make sure that this is indeed the infimum.\n\nBut wait, perhaps we can find a smaller value. Because when x\u00b2 approaches 720/11 from above, s approaches zero, and u\u00b2 approaches infinity. So, the minimal value is approached as x\u00b2 increases.\n\nSo, the infimum is 2880/11, but BD\u00b2 can't be less than that.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the infimum is 2880/11, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 2880/11, but wait, 2880/11 is approximately 261.818. But no, wait, BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 2880/11, but never less than that.\n\nWait, no, wait. Since u\u00b2 approaches 720/11 from above, then BD\u00b2=4 u\u00b2 approaches 4*(720/11 )=2880/11\u2248261.818 from above. So, BD\u00b2 can get as close as we like to 2880/11, but is always greater than 2880/11. Therefore, the infimum is 2880/11, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 2880/11.\n\nWait, but 2880/11 is equal to 261 and 9/11. So, 261.818.\n\nBut let me confirm this.\n\nWait, so u\u00b2 approaches 720/11 from above, so BD\u00b2 approaches 4*(720/11 )=2880/11.\n\nTherefore, 2880/11 is the infimum, meaning the greatest lower bound for BD\u00b2 is 2880/11.\n\nHence, the answer should be 2880/11, which is approximately 261.818.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the algebra correctly.\n\nWe had u\u00b2 = [720 (t -20 ) ] / (11 t -720 )\n\nThen, t =x\u00b2, so as t\u2192infty,\n\nu\u00b2 ~ (720 t ) / 11 t ) =720/11.\n\nSo, yes, the limit is 720/11.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 approaches 4*(720/11 )=2880/11.\n\nSo, the minimal value is 2880/11, and it's the infimum.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 2880/11.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because 2880/11 seems a bit large. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using parametrization.\n\nLet me consider that points A and B are on the hyperbola, and OA is perpendicular to OB.\n\nLet me parametrize point A as (sqrt(20) sec \u03b8, sqrt(24) tan \u03b8 ). Similarly, point B as (sqrt(20) sec \u03c6, sqrt(24) tan \u03c6 ).\n\nThen, OA \u00b7 OB =0:\n\nsqrt(20) sec \u03b8 * sqrt(20) sec \u03c6 + sqrt(24) tan \u03b8 * sqrt(24) tan \u03c6 =0\n\nWhich is:\n\n20 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 +24 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6=0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 sec \u03b8 sec \u03c6 +6 tan \u03b8 tan \u03c6=0\n\nSo,\n\n5 / (cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6 ) +6 (sin \u03b8 / cos \u03b8 )( sin \u03c6 / cos \u03c6 )=0\n\nMultiply both sides by cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6:\n\n5 +6 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6=0\n\nSo,\n\n6 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 =-5\n\nWhich is the same as earlier.\n\nSo,\n\nsin \u03b8 sin \u03c6= -5/6\n\nSo, sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6= -5/6.\n\nSo, we have sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6= -5/6.\n\nNow, we can express BD\u00b2=4 |OB|\u00b2=4*(20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6 )\n\nCompute |OB|\u00b2=20 sec\u00b2 \u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nExpress in terms of sin \u03c6:\n\nsec\u00b2 \u03c6=1 + tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo,\n\n|OB|\u00b2=20(1 + tan\u00b2 \u03c6 ) +24 tan\u00b2 \u03c6=20 +44 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(20 +44 tan\u00b2 \u03c6 )=80 +176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, we need to minimize 80 +176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nBut we have the condition sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6= -5/6.\n\nExpress tan\u00b2 \u03c6 in terms of sin \u03c6.\n\nWe know that tan\u00b2 \u03c6= (1 - cos\u00b2 \u03c6 ) / cos\u00b2 \u03c6= (sin\u00b2 \u03c6 ) / cos\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, let me write BD\u00b2=80 +176 (sin\u00b2 \u03c6 / cos\u00b2 \u03c6 )\n\nBut we need to express sin \u03c6 in terms of sin \u03b8.\n\nWait, from sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6= -5/6, so sin \u03b8= (-5)/(6 sin \u03c6 )\n\nBut |sin \u03b8| \u22641, so | (-5)/(6 sin \u03c6 ) | \u22641\n\n=> |5/(6 sin \u03c6)| \u22641\n\n=> |sin \u03c6| \u22655/6\n\nSo, sin \u03c6 \u22655/6 or sin \u03c6 \u2264-5/6.\n\nSo, let me set sin \u03c6=5/6 or sin \u03c6=-5/6.\n\nBecause for the minimal BD\u00b2, perhaps sin \u03c6 is maximum, i.e., sin \u03c6=5/6 or -5/6.\n\nWait, but if sin \u03c6=5/6, then sin \u03b8= (-5)/(6*(5/6 ))= -1\n\nSimilarly, if sin \u03c6=-5/6, sin \u03b8= (-5)/(6*(-5/6 ))=1\n\nSo, in these cases, sin \u03b8=\u00b11.\n\nSo, sin \u03b8=1 implies \u03b8=\u03c0/2, so cos \u03b8=0.\n\nSo, point A is (sqrt(20) sec(\u03c0/2 ), sqrt(24) tan(\u03c0/2 )).\n\nBut sec(\u03c0/2 ) is undefined, as cos \u03c0/2=0. Similarly, tan \u03c0/2 is undefined.\n\nSo, that's a problem. So, maybe sin \u03c6 can't be exactly 5/6 because that would require \u03b8=\u03c0/2, which is not on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when sin \u03c6 approaches 5/6, so that \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, but doesn't reach it.\n\nSo, in that case, as sin \u03c6 approaches 5/6 from above, \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2, but remains finite.\n\nBut in terms of the minimal BD\u00b2, perhaps we can use calculus to minimize BD\u00b2 with respect to \u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 +176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6\n\nWe need to express this in terms of sin \u03c6.\n\nBut with the condition sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6= -5/6, and we have another equation from the hyperbola.\n\nWait, perhaps express tan\u00b2 \u03c6 in terms of sin \u03c6.\n\nFrom sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6= -5/6, and since sin \u03b8= (-5)/(6 sin \u03c6 )\n\nBut point A is on the hyperbola, so (sqrt(20) sec \u03b8 )\u00b2 /20 - (sqrt(24) tan \u03b8 )\u00b2 /24 =1.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(20 sec\u00b2 \u03b8 ) /20 - (24 tan\u00b2 \u03b8 )/24=1\n\nWhich is:\n\nsec\u00b2 \u03b8 - tan\u00b2 \u03b8=1\n\nBut sec\u00b2 \u03b8 - tan\u00b2 \u03b8=1, which is an identity, so it's always true.\n\nSo, that doesn't give us any new information.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2=80 +176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6, given that sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6= -5/6.\n\nBut we can express tan\u00b2 \u03c6 in terms of sin \u03c6.\n\nWe have tan\u00b2 \u03c6= (1 - cos\u00b2 \u03c6 ) / cos\u00b2 \u03c6= (sin\u00b2 \u03c6 ) / cos\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 +176 (sin\u00b2 \u03c6 ) / cos\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nBut we have sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6= -5/6.\n\nFrom this, sin \u03b8= (-5)/(6 sin \u03c6 )\n\nBut we also know that sin\u00b2 \u03b8 + cos\u00b2 \u03b8=1.\n\nSo,\n\n[ (-5/(6 sin \u03c6 )) ]\u00b2 + cos\u00b2 \u03b8=1\n\nSo,\n\n25/(36 sin\u00b2 \u03c6 ) + cos\u00b2 \u03b8=1\n\nBut cos\u00b2 \u03b8=1 - sin\u00b2 \u03b8=1 -25/(36 sin\u00b2 \u03c6 )\n\nBut wait,\n\nWait, sin \u03b8= (-5)/(6 sin \u03c6 )\n\nSo, sin\u00b2 \u03b8=25/(36 sin\u00b2 \u03c6 )\n\nTherefore, cos\u00b2 \u03b8=1 -25/(36 sin\u00b2 \u03c6 )\n\nSo, point A is on the hyperbola, and for point A, we have:\n\nx\u00b2 /20 - y\u00b2 /24=1,\n\nwhere x= sqrt(20) sec \u03b8, y= sqrt(24 ) tan \u03b8.\n\nBut as we saw earlier, this gives an identity, so it doesn't help.\n\nBut perhaps we can consider that point A is on the hyperbola, so 24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2=480.\n\nExpress x and y in terms of \u03b8.\n\nx= sqrt(20) sec \u03b8,\n\ny= sqrt(24 ) tan \u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n24*(20 sec\u00b2 \u03b8 ) -20*(24 tan\u00b2 \u03b8 )=480\n\nWhich is,\n\n480 sec\u00b2 \u03b8 -480 tan\u00b2 \u03b8=480\n\nDivide both sides by 480:\n\nsec\u00b2 \u03b8 - tan\u00b2 \u03b8=1\n\nWhich is again an identity, as sec\u00b2 \u03b8=1 + tan\u00b2 \u03b8.\n\nSo, again, no new info.\n\nSo, going back, we have:\n\nFrom sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6= -5/6,\n\nand BD\u00b2=80 +176 tan\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nWe need to express tan\u00b2 \u03c6 in terms of sin \u03c6.\n\nAs above,\n\nBD\u00b2=80 +176 (sin\u00b2 \u03c6 ) / (1 - sin\u00b2 \u03c6 )\n\nSo, let me denote s= sin \u03c6, so  s \u22655/6.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2=80 +176 s\u00b2 / (1 - s\u00b2 )\n\nWe need to minimize BD\u00b2 in terms of s, where s \u22655/6 and s \u22641.\n\nSo, let me define f(s)=80 + (176 s\u00b2 )/(1 -s\u00b2 )\n\nFind the minimum of f(s) for s in [5/6,1 ).\n\nCompute derivative f\u2019(s):\n\nf\u2019(s)= d/ds [80] + d/ds [176 s\u00b2 / (1 -s\u00b2 ) ]\n\n=0 + 176 [ (2s (1 -s\u00b2 ) - s\u00b2 (-2s )) / (1 -s\u00b2 )\u00b2 ]\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n2s(1 -s\u00b2 ) + 2s\u00b3=2s -2s\u00b3 +2s\u00b3=2s.\n\nSo,\n\nf\u2019(s)=176*(2s )/(1 -s\u00b2 )\u00b2=352 s / (1 -s\u00b2 )\u00b2\n\nSince s \u22655/6 >0, and denominator is positive, f\u2019(s )>0 for all s in (5/6,1 )\n\nTherefore, f(s) is increasing on [5/6,1 ). Therefore, the minimal value of f(s) occurs at s=5/6.\n\nSo, compute f(5/6):\n\nf(5/6)=80 +176*( (25/36 ))/(1 -25/36 )\n\nCompute denominator:\n\n1 -25/36=11/36\n\nSo,\n\nf(5/6)=80 +176*(25/36 )/(11/36 )=80 +176*(25/11 )=80 +16*25=80 +400=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480 when s=5/6.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, but earlier, we thought it approaches 2880/11\u2248261.818.\n\nBut this contradicts our earlier conclusion. So, why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps because when we set sin \u03c6=5/6, we have to consider that sin \u03b8= (-5)/(6*(5/6 ))= -1.\n\nBut sin \u03b8= -1 implies \u03b8= -\u03c0/2, which makes point A=(sqrt(20) sec(-\u03c0/2 ), sqrt(24 ) tan(-\u03c0/2 )) which is undefined, as sec(-\u03c0/2 ) and tan(-\u03c0/2 ) are undefined.\n\nSo, that point is not on the hyperbola, hence s cannot actually reach 5/6.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is approached as s approaches 5/6 from above, but can't actually reach it.\n\nTherefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, but BD\u00b2 can approach 480 from above.\n\nWait, but this is conflicting with our earlier result where BD\u00b2 approaches 2880/11\u2248261.818.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization.\n\nWait, in the first approach, we considered u\u00b2= [720 (x\u00b2 -20 ) ] / (11 x\u00b2 -720 )\n\nAnd found that as x\u00b2 approaches infinity, u\u00b2 approaches 720/11, so BD\u00b2 approaches 4*720/11=2880/11\u2248261.818.\n\nBut in the second approach, using parametrization with sin \u03c6, we found that BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as sin \u03c6 approaches 5/6.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the second approach is flawed because when sin \u03c6 approaches 5/6, point B approaches ( sqrt(20) sec \u03c6, sqrt(24 ) tan \u03c6 )\n\nBut as sin \u03c6 approaches 5/6, cos \u03c6 approaches sqrt(1 -25/36 )=sqrt(11/36 )=sqrt(11)/6.\n\nSo, sec \u03c6=1/cos \u03c6=6/sqrt(11 )\n\nSimilarly, tan \u03c6= sin \u03c6 / cos \u03c6= (5/6 )/( sqrt(11)/6 )=5/sqrt(11 )\n\nSo, point B approaches ( sqrt(20)*6/sqrt(11 ), sqrt(24 )*5/sqrt(11 ) )\n\nCompute |OB|\u00b2= (sqrt(20)*6/sqrt(11 ))^2 + (sqrt(24)*5/sqrt(11 ))^2\n\n= (20 *36 )/11 + (24 *25 )/11\n\n= (720 +600 ) /11=1320/11=120.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*120=480.\n\nSo, as sin \u03c6 approaches 5/6, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut in the first approach, as x\u00b2 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches approximately 261.818.\n\nSo, which is the correct infimum?\n\nWait, 261.818 is less than 480, so if BD\u00b2 can approach 261.818, that would be the infimum.\n\nBut in the second approach, we found that BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as sin \u03c6 approaches 5/6, but in reality, sin \u03c6 cannot reach 5/6 because that would require \u03b8 to be -\u03c0/2, which is not allowed.\n\nBut in the first approach, as x\u00b2 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 2880/11\u2248261.818.\n\nSo, why the difference?\n\nWait, perhaps the parametrization in the second approach restricts the possible values, but the first approach allows more general points.\n\nWait, in the second approach, point A is parametrized as (sqrt(20) sec \u03b8, sqrt(24 ) tan \u03b8 ), and point B similarly.\n\nBut in reality, the hyperbola has two branches, and points A and B can be on different branches.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the rhombus has diagonals intersecting at the origin, so points A and C are on opposite ends, and points B and D are on opposite ends.\n\nSo, if point A is on one branch, point C is on the other branch, same with points B and D.\n\nSo, when point A is on the right branch, point C is on the left branch, and same for B and D.\n\nSo, parametrization using \u03b8 and \u03c6 where sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6= -5/6 could have points on different branches.\n\nWait, but in the parametrization I used earlier, both points A and B were on the same branch. So, perhaps that's the mistake.\n\nBecause in reality, points A and B can be on different branches, so that OA \u00b7 OB=0 can be satisfied without requiring sin \u03c6=5/6.\n\nSo, perhaps the second approach was incorrect because it assumed both points A and B are on the same branch, but in reality, they can be on different branches.\n\nTherefore, the correct minimal BD\u00b2 is achieved when points A and B are on different branches, allowing BD\u00b2 to approach 2880/11\u2248261.818.\n\nSo, the first approach is correct, and the second approach was flawed because it restricted points to the same branch.\n\nTherefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 2880/11, which is approximately 261.818.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 2880/11.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me confirm this.\n\nSo, in the first approach, we found that BD\u00b2 can approach 2880/11\u2248261.818 as x\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, for example, take x\u00b2 very large, so that u\u00b2 approaches 720/11, so BD\u00b2 approaches 4*(720/11 )=2880/11.\n\nThus, the infimum is 2880/11, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 2880/11.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2880/11, which is equal to 261 and 9/11.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2880/11.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombi is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{2880}{11}}\\).\n\n\nGiven points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) forming a rhombus \\(ABCD\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin, we need to find the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi.\n\n1. **Properties of the Rhombus**:\n   - The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.\n   - Points \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are endpoints of one diagonal, and points \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) are endpoints of the other diagonal.\n   - The origin is the midpoint of both diagonals, so if \\(A\\) is \\((x, y)\\), then \\(C\\) is \\((-x, -y)\\), and similarly for \\(B\\) and \\(D\\).\n\n2. **Hyperbola Parametrization**:\n   - Points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) lie on the hyperbola and can be parametrized as \\(A(2\\sqrt{5} \\sec \\theta, 2\\sqrt{6} \\tan \\theta)\\) and \\(B(2\\sqrt{5} \\sec \\phi, 2\\sqrt{6} \\tan \\phi)\\).\n   - The condition \\(OA \\cdot OB = 0\\) implies \\(a_x b_x + a_y b_y = 0\\), leading to the equation \\(20 \\sec \\theta \\sec \\phi + 24 \\tan \\theta \\tan \\phi = 0\\).\n\n3. **Simplifying the Condition**:\n   - This simplifies to \\(\\sin \\theta \\sin \\phi = -\\frac{5}{6}\\).\n\n4. **Minimizing \\(BD^2\\)**:\n   - The length of diagonal \\(BD\\) is twice the length of vector \\(OB\\).\n   - The length of \\(OB\\) is given by \\(\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{5} \\sec \\phi)^2 + (2\\sqrt{6} \\tan \\phi)^2}\\).\n   - Simplifying, we find \\(BD^2 = 4 \\left(20 \\sec^2 \\phi + 24 \\tan^2 \\phi\\right)\\).\n\n5. **Finding the Infimum**:\n   - Using the condition \\(\\sin \\theta \\sin \\phi = -\\frac{5}{6}\\) and parametrizing the points, we find that as \\(x^2\\) approaches infinity, the length \\(BD^2\\) approaches \\(\\frac{2880}{11}\\).\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{2880}{11}}\\).",
