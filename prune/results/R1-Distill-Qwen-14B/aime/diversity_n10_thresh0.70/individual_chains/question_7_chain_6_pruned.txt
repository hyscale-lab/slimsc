Alright, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with a 50-50 chance. The question is about the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer needs to be expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then we have to find m + n.

Okay, let me try to break this down.

First, the octagon is regular, so it has 8 sides, and each vertex can be rotated to any of the other positions. The colorings are independent and each has a 50% chance. So, each vertex is red with probability 1/2 and blue with probability 1/2.

The key here is that after some rotation, all the blue vertices must align with positions that were originally red. So, the rotated octagon should have blue in every spot where the original had red. Wait, no, not exactly. Because the rotation is such that the blue ones end up where the red ones were. Hmm, maybe it's better to think of it as a kind of permutation.

Let me think: Each rotation corresponds to a permutation of the vertices. So, if we rotate the octagon by k positions, each vertex i moves to position i + k mod 8. So, the condition is that for each blue vertex in the original coloring, after rotation, it must be in a position that was originally red.

Wait, no, not exactly. Let me rephrase: The problem says that after rotation, all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. So, if in the original coloring, some positions are red and some are blue, we want a rotation such that when we apply it, every blue vertex moves to a position that was red in the original.

Alternatively, in terms of permutation, if σ is the permutation corresponding to the rotation, then for every blue vertex v, σ(v) is a red vertex in the original.

Wait, so for each blue vertex v, its image under σ must have been red. That is, σ maps blue vertices to red vertices.

Alternatively, the set of blue vertices must be a subset of the image of the red vertices under the inverse permutation σ⁻¹. Hmm, maybe that's getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the colorings. Let me denote the original coloring as a vector C = (C₀, C₁, ..., C₇), where each C_i is either red or blue. After a rotation by k positions, the coloring becomes (C_{i - k mod 8}) for each i. So, for each i, the color at position i after rotation is C_{i - k mod 8}.

We want that for all i, if C_i is blue, then after rotation, C_{i - k mod 8} must be red. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should rephrase. After rotation, each blue vertex in the original must move to a position that was originally red. So, for each vertex j that is blue in the original coloring, when we rotate by k, it moves to position (j + k) mod 8, and that position must have been red in the original coloring.

So, for each blue vertex j, C_j =
