Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a special point inside it to each of its faces. The point is such that all its distances to the faces are equal, which I think is called the incenter or something like that. The answer needs to be in a specific form, and then I have to sum m, n, and p. Hmm.

First, let me try to visualize the tetrahedron. It has four triangular faces, and all opposite edges are equal. So AB equals CD, AC equals BD, and BC equals AD. This seems symmetrical in some way. Maybe it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron? I remember that in some tetrahedrons, if opposite edges are equal, they have some nice properties, like having an insphere or something.

Since all the opposite edges are equal, I think this tetrahedron is called isohedral or maybe isohedral. Wait, maybe it's isohedral, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's a disphenoid? Yes, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. So, yes, this is a disphenoid. That might help because disphenoids have some properties that can be useful, like the inradius.

Now, the point I is the incenter, right? Because it's equidistant from all the faces. So, the distance from I to each face is the inradius. I need to find the inradius.

I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

Where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I need to compute the volume and the surface area.

But wait, this is a disphenoid, so maybe there's a simpler way. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using coordinates. Since the edge lengths are given, maybe it's possible to assign coordinates to the vertices and compute the volume and surface area.

So, let me try that. Let me assign coordinates to the tetrahedron. Since opposite edges are equal, perhaps it's symmetric in some way. Let's choose a coordinate system that makes things symmetric.

Let me set points A, B, C, D in such a way that the midpoints of opposite edges are at the origin. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe place the tetrahedron so that the centroid is at the origin.

Wait, maybe an easier approach. Let me consider that in a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal, and all faces are congruent triangles. Wait, in this case, are the faces congruent? Let me check the edge lengths.

Given: AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). So, each face has sides sqrt41, sqrt80, sqrt89. So, all four faces are congruent triangles. That's interesting. So, all faces are congruent, which means that the tetrahedron is isohedral, which is a stronger condition than being a disphenoid. So, in this case, it's an isohedral tetrahedron, so all faces are the same.

So, that might make things easier because the surface area would just be four times the area of one face.

So, let me compute the area of one face first. Let's take triangle ABC with sides AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), and AC = sqrt(80). So, to find the area, I can use Heron's formula.

First, compute the semi-perimeter, s.

s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(89) + sqrt(80)) / 2

Wait, but Heron's formula is area = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], but computing that might be a bit messy with square roots. Maybe it's better to calculate the area using vectors or coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume first, and then use the inradius formula.

Wait, but to compute the volume, maybe I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant. Since I have all the edge lengths, that might be the way to go.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD is given by:

Volume^2 = (1/288) * determinant of the matrix:

0 1 1 1 1
1 0 AB² AC² AD²
1 AB² 0 BC² BD²
1 AC² BC² 0 CD²
1 AD² BD² CD² 0

So, let me assign variables to the squared lengths to make it easier.

AB² = 41
AC² = 80
AD² =89
BC²=89
BD²=80
CD²=41

So, the matrix is:

0  1    1    1    1
1  0   41   80   89
1 41    0   89   80
1 80   89    0   41
1 89   80   41    0

I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. Hmm, that's a bit involved, but maybe I can find a pattern or some symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way because of the symmetric edge lengths.

Wait, let me write the determinant:

|0 1 1 1 1|
|1 0 41 80
