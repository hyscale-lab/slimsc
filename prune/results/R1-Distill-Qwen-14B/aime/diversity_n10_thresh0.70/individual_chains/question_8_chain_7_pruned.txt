Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, this seems a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I notice that the second equation is symmetric in terms of a, b, and c. Maybe I can factor it or express it in a different way to make it easier to handle.

Looking closer, the second equation can be rewritten by factoring:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the entire second equation becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000

But from the first equation, I know that a + b + c = 300. So, for example, (b + c) = 300 - a, and similarly for the others.

Substituting these into the second equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

So that simplifies to:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Hmm, so the equation is now:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

I wonder if I can relate a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ to the first equation. Let me think about some identities or expressions that involve these.

I know that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c = 300, then:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)
90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)

So, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)

Let me denote S = ab + bc + ca. Then,

a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2S

Now, I can substitute this back into the equation I had earlier:

300(90,000 - 2S) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Let me compute 300*(90,000 - 2S):

300*90,000 = 27,000,000

300*(-2S) = -600S

So,

27,000,000 - 600S - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Let me rearrange:

-600S - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000 - 27,000,000

Which is:

-600S - (a³ + b³ + c³) = -21,000,000

Multiplying both sides by -1:

600S + (a³ + b³ + c³) = 21,000,000

Hmm, okay. So now I have:

a³ + b³ + c³ + 600S = 21,000,000

I'm not sure if this is helpful yet. Maybe I can find another identity involving a³ + b³ + c³.

I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed in terms of a + b + c, ab + bc + ca, and abc. The formula is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc

Let me write that down:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (300)^3 - 3*300*S + 3abc

Compute (300)^3: 27,000,000

So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900S + 3abc

Substituting this into the previous equation:

(27,000,000 - 900S + 3abc) + 600S = 21,000,000

Simplify:

27,000,000 - 900S + 3abc + 600S = 21,000,000

Combine like terms:

27,000,000 - 300S + 3abc = 21,000,000

Subtract 21,000,000 from both sides:

6,000,000 - 300S + 3abc = 0

Let me write that as:

3abc - 300S = -6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

abc - 100S = -2,000,000

So,

abc = 100S - 2,000,000

Hmm, this is an interesting equation. Now I have an expression for abc in terms of S.

Wait, let me recap what S is. S is ab + bc + ca. So, S is the sum of the pairwise products.

So, now I have:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000

That's the key equation. So, my goal is to find all triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300, and abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.

This seems a bit complex, but perhaps I can manipulate it further.

Let me rearrange the equation:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000

Hmm, maybe factor this differently. Let's see.

I can factor ab from the first two terms:

ab(c - 100) - 100c a - 100c b = -2,000,000

Wait, that doesn't seem particularly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor differently.

Wait, maybe consider that since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and their sum is 300, maybe one of them is significantly larger than the others. Or perhaps two of them are equal, or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps divide both sides by abc, but that might complicate things.

Wait, let me think about the equation:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000

I can write this as:

abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ca = -2,000,000

Factor terms:

ab(c - 100) - 100c(a + b) = -2,000,000

Hmm, since a + b + c = 300, then a + b = 300 - c.

So substitute that in:

ab(c - 100) - 100c(300 - c) = -2,000,000

So,

ab(c - 100) - 100c(300 - c) = -2,000,000

Hmm, perhaps this can help. Let me write:

ab(c - 100) = 100c(300 - c) - 2,000,000

Let me compute the right-hand side:

100c(300 - c) = 30,000c - 100c²

So,

ab(c - 100) = 30,000c - 100c² - 2,000,000

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe I can factor out 100 from the right-hand side:

ab(c - 100) = 100(300c - c²) - 2,000,000

Wait, 2,000,000 is 20,000 * 100, so:

ab(c - 100) = 100(300c - c² - 20,000)

Hmm, maybe that's a way to present it, but I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps express ab in terms of c.

From a + b + c = 300, a + b = 300 - c.

Let me denote t = a + b = 300 - c.

Then, I can express ab in terms of t and the variables.

Wait, but ab is part of S, which is ab + bc + ca.

Wait, S = ab + bc + ca
