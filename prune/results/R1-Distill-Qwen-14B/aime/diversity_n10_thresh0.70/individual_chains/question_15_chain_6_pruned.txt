Okay, so I've got this problem here about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which makes sense because an 8x8 grid has 8 rows and 8 columns, so moving from the lower left to the upper right would require 8 right and 8 up moves, totaling 16 moves.

The key point is that the paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay. So, normally, a path on a grid that goes from one corner to the opposite without any restrictions is just a matter of choosing where to go right and where to go up. For an 8x8 grid, the number of such paths is the combination of 16 moves taken 8 at a time for right moves (or equivalently up moves). So that's C(16,8), which is 12870. But that's without any restrictions on direction changes.

Now, the problem wants only those paths that change direction exactly four times. So, I need to think about what it means to change direction on such a path. Each time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, in a path that starts with a right move, every time it turns up, that's a direction change, and vice versa.

Wait, let me clarify: a direction change occurs when the movement switches from right to up or up to right. So, if the path is moving right and then switches to up, that's one direction change. If it continues moving right, no change. Similarly, if it's moving up and then switches to right, that's another direction change.

So, the number of direction changes is related to the number of times the path alternates between right and up moves. Each time it alternates, that's a direction change. So, for example, a path that goes all the way right and then all the way up would have exactly one direction change. Conversely, a path that alternates every step (right, up, right, up, etc.) would have 15 direction changes, which is the maximum possible for a 16-step path.

But we need exactly four direction changes. So, how do we model that?

I think the problem can be approached by considering that the path is made up of runs of consecutive right or up moves. Each time a run ends, a direction change occurs. So, for four direction changes, the path will have five runs. Wait, yeah, because each change starts a new run. So, if you have four direction changes, you have five runs in total.

But each run alternates direction. So, the runs alternate between right and up. So, if the path starts with a right move, the runs would be right, up, right, up, etc. Similarly, if it starts with up, the runs would be up, right, up, right, etc.

So, for four direction changes, the number of runs is five. Now, the number of runs in each direction will depend on whether the path starts with right or up.

Wait, let's think about it. If the path starts with right, then the runs would be right, up, right, up, right. So, three right runs and two up runs. Similarly, if it starts with up, the runs would be up, right, up,
