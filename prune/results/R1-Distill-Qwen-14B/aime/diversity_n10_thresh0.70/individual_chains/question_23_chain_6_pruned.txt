Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x². The a² is 20, so a = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5), and b² is 24, so b = 2*sqrt(6). 

Now, the problem says there's a rhombus ABCD on this hyperbola. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, no, wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me correct that. In a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, no, another correction: In a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait,
