Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\), given that \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\). Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number \(z\) can be expressed in polar form. Since the magnitude of \(z\) is 4, I can write \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), where \(\theta\) is the argument of \(z\). That might make things easier to handle, especially because when dealing with reciprocals of complex numbers, the magnitude comes into play.

So, if \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), then the reciprocal \(1/z\) would be \(\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\), right? Because \(1/z = \overline{z}/|z|^2\), and since \(|z| = 4\), that becomes \(\overline{z}/16\). But since \(z\) is in polar form, the reciprocal is just the conjugate over the square of the magnitude.

Now, let me substitute \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the original expression. The expression becomes:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Let me compute each term separately. First, the term \((75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta}\):

Multiplying 75 and 117 by 4, I get 300 and 468. So that term is \(300 + 468i\) multiplied by \(e^{i\theta}\). When I multiply a complex number by \(e^{i\theta}\), it's equivalent to rotating the complex number by an angle \(\theta\). So this term becomes \((300 + 468i)e^{i\theta}\).

Similarly, the second term \(\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}\) simplifies to \((24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}\). Because dividing by 4 gives 24 and 36, and then the reciprocal \(1/e^{i\theta}\) is \(e^{-i\theta}\).

So now, my expression is:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

I think it might be helpful to express these terms in terms of sine and cosine. Remembering Euler's formula, \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\).

Let me denote \(A = 300 + 468i\) and \(B = 24 + 36i\). So the expression becomes \(A e^{i\theta} + B e^{-i\theta}\).

Expanding both terms:

- \(A e^{i\theta} = (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)\)
- \(B e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)\)

Let me compute each product.

Starting with \(A e^{i\theta}\):

Multiply \(300\) by \(\cos\theta\): \(300\cos\theta\)

Multiply \(300\) by \(i\sin\theta\): \(300i\sin\theta\)

Multiply \(468i\) by \(\cos\theta\): \(468i\cos\theta\)

Multiply \(468i\) by \(i\sin\theta\): \(468i^2\sin\theta = 468(-1)\sin\theta = -468\sin\theta\)

So combining all terms:

\(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)\)

Similarly, for \(B e^{-i\theta}\):

Multiply \(24\) by \(\cos\theta\): \(24\cos\theta\)

Multiply \(24\) by \(-i\sin\theta\): \(-24i\sin\theta\)

Multiply \(36i\) by \(\cos\theta\): \(36i\cos\theta\)

Multiply \(36i\) by \(-i\sin\theta\): \(36(-i^2)\sin\theta = 36(1)\sin\theta = 36\sin\theta\)

So combining terms:

\(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta + i(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)\)

Now, adding the two expressions together:

Real parts:
- From \(A e^{i\theta}\): \(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta\)
- From \(B e^{-i\theta}\): \(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\)
Total real part: \(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\)

Imaginary parts:
- From \(A e^{i\theta}\): \(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta\)
- From \(B e^{-i\theta}\): \(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta\)
Total imaginary part: \(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta\)

Simplify the real and imaginary parts.

Real part:
\( (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

Imaginary part:
\( (300 -24)\sin\theta + (468 + 36)\cos\theta = 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta \)

So the entire expression is:

\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta)
\]

But since the problem asks for the largest possible real part, I can focus just on the real part, which is \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\).

Let me denote \(R(\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). I need to find the maximum value of \(R(\theta)\).

I recall that an expression of the form \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\) can be rewritten as \(C\cos(\theta + \phi)\) or \(C\sin(\theta + \phi)\), where \(C = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\). The maximum value of such an expression is \(C\), since the amplitude is \(C\).

Wait, but in my case, the expression is \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). So, it's like \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\) with \(A = 324\) and \(B = -432\).

So, the maximum value of \(R(\theta)\) would be \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\), because the maximum of \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\). Let me verify this.

Yes, \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \cos(\theta - \phi)\), where \(\phi\) is the phase shift such that \(\cos\phi = A/\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\) and \(\sin\phi = B/\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\). The maximum value is indeed when \(\cos(\theta - \phi) = 1\), so the maximum is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\).

So, in this case, \(A = 324\), \(B = -432\). Therefore, the maximum real part would be \(\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2}\).

Let me compute that.

First, compute \(324^2\): 324 * 324. Hmm, 300^2 = 90000, 24^2 = 576, and cross terms 2*300*24=14400. So 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 105, 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, \(432^2\): 400^2 = 160,000, 32^2=1024, and cross terms 2*400*32=25,600. So 160,000 + 25,600 = 185,600; plus 1024 is 186,624. Since B is -432, the square is same.

So, \(A^2 = 104,976\), \(B^2 = 186,624\). So \(A^2 + B^2 = 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600\).

Therefore, the maximum real part is \(\sqrt{291,600}\). Let's compute that.

Well, 540^2 = 291,600 because 500^2=250,000, 40^2=1,600, and cross terms 2*500*40=40,000. So 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So \(\sqrt{291,600} = 540\).

Wait, so that means the maximum real part is 540. But wait, let me check my calculations again because I feel like I might have messed up somewhere.

Wait, no, let's see. Let me confirm \(540^2 = 291,600\). 500^2 is 250,000, 40^2 is 1,600, and 2*500*40 is 40,000. So 250,000 + 40,000 is 290,000, plus 1,600 is 291,600. Yep, that's correct.

So, the maximum real part is 540. Therefore, the largest possible real part of the given expression is 540.

But wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps. Let me recap.

We started by expressing \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), then substituted into the expression, expanded, and ended up with the real part as \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). Then, to find the maximum real part, we treated it as \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\) with \(A=324\), \(B=-432\), and found the maximum as \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} = 540\). So that seems correct.

I think that's solid. So the answer should be 540.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Simplifying each term, we have:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]
