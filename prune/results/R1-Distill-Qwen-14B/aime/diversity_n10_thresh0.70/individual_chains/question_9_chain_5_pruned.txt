Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the product of x and y, given that both are real numbers greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember some logarithm properties, so maybe I can use those to solve for x and y.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I think I can use the logarithm power rule, which says that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So applying that to both equations.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the power rule, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. So, log_x(y) = 10 / x. Hmm, that's one equation.

Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. So, log_y(x) = 10 / (4y) = 5 / (2y).

Now, I remember that log_b(a) and log_a(b) are reciprocals of each other. So, log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x). Let me check that. Yes, because log_x(y) = (ln y)/(ln x) and log_y(x) = (ln x)/(ln y), so they are reciprocals.

So, from the first equation, log_x(y) = 10 / x, and from the second, log_y(x) = 5 / (2y). Since log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x), I can set them equal:

10 / x = 1 / (5 / (2y)).

Let me simplify that. The right side is 1 divided by (5/(2y)), which is (2y)/5. So:

10 / x = (2y)/5.

Cross-multiplying gives 10 * 5 = 2y * x. So, 50 = 2xy. Dividing both sides by 2, we get xy = 25. Wait, so does that mean the product xy is 25? Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake.

Let me double-check the reciprocal relationship. If log_x(y) = a, then log_y(x) = 1/a. So from the first equation, log_x(y) = 10/x, so log_y(x) should be x/10. But according to the second equation, log_y(x) is 5/(2y). So setting x/10 = 5/(2y), that's x/10 = 5/(2y). Cross-multiplying, x*(2y) = 10*5 → 2xy =50 → xy=25. Yes, that matches the earlier result.

So, the product xy is 25. But wait, let me make sure that x and y actually exist and satisfy the original equations. Because sometimes when we manipulate equations, especially with logs, we might introduce extraneous solutions or maybe miss constraints.

Given that x and y are both greater than 1, so positive and greater than 1, which is good because log functions are defined for positive numbers not equal to 1.

Let me try to find x and y individually, just to confirm.

From the first equation, log_x(y^x) =10, which gave us log_x(y) =10/x, so y = x^{10/x}.

From the second equation, log_y(x^{4y})=10, which gave us log_y(x) =5/(2y), so x = y^{5/(2y)}.

Now, substitute y from the first equation into the second equation. So, x = (x^{10/x})^{5/(2y)}.

Wait, but y is x^{10/x}, so substituting that in:

x = (x^{10/x})^{5/(2 * x^{10/x})}.

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let's see if I can simplify this.

Simplify the exponent: (10/x) multiplied by (5)/(2 * x^{10/x}) is (10/x)*(5)/(2 x^{10/x}) = (50)/(2x * x^{10/x}) )= 25/(x^{1 + 10/x}).

So, x =
