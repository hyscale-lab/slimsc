Okay, so I have this problem where I need to fill a 2x3 grid with digits (0-9) such that when I read the numbers left to right, their sum is 999, and when I read them top to bottom, their sum is 99. The example given is:

0 0 8
9 9 1

Which works because 0 + 991 = 991, but wait, that's not 999. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, looking again: the two numbers left to right are 008 and 991. So 008 + 991 is 999. Right, okay, because 8 + 991 is 999. And then top to bottom, the three numbers would be 09, 09, and 81. So 09 + 09 + 81 is 99. Yeah, that makes sense.

So the grid is 2 rows and 3 columns. Let me visualize it as:

a b c
d e f

So the numbers formed left to right are abc and def, which are three-digit numbers. Their sum is 999. Then, the numbers formed top to bottom are ad, be, and cf, which are two-digit numbers. Their sum is 99.

So, we have two equations:

1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
2. 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Wait, but maybe I should represent them more clearly. So:

First equation: abc + def = 999
Second equation: ad + be + cf = 99

I need to find the number of possible digit assignments (a,b,c,d,e,f) that satisfy both equations.

Let me write down the equations in terms of a, b, c, d, e, f.

Equation 1: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
Which simplifies to 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Equation 2: (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
Which simplifies to 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

So now, I have two equations:

1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
2. 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Hmm, perhaps I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate some variables. Let's see:

Equation 1 minus equation 2:

(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99
Simplify term by term:

100a -10a = 90a
10b -10b = 0
c -10c = -9c
100d -d = 99d
10e -e =9e
f -f =0

So, putting it together:

90a -9c +99d +9e = 900

We can factor out a 9:

9*(10a - c + 11d + e) = 900

Divide both sides by 9:

10a - c +11d + e = 100

So now, equation 3: 10a - c + 11d + e = 100.

Hmm, that's a new equation. Now, I have equation 2 and equation 3.

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Equation 3: 10a - c +11d + e = 100.

Let me see if I can express some variables in terms of others.

Maybe let's try to express e from equation 3.

From equation 3:

e = 100 -10a + c -11d.

So, e = 100 -10a + c -11d.

Then, substitute e into equation 2.

Equation 2:

10a + d + 10b + (100 -10a + c -11d) + 10c + f = 99.

Simplify step by step:

10a + d + 10b + 100 -10a + c -11d +10c + f = 99.

Combine like terms:

(10a -10a) + (d -11d) + 10b + (c +10c) +100 + f = 99.

Simplify each term:

0a -10d +10b +11c +100 +f = 99.

So, -10d +10b +11c +f +100 =99.

Subtract 100 from both sides:

-10d +10b +11c +f = -1.

Wait, that's:

-10d +10b +11c +f = -1.

Hmm, that seems a bit complex because all variables are digits (0-9). Let me rearrange it:

10b +11c +f = 10d -1.

Since all variables are digits (0-9), let's think about the possible ranges.

First, 10b can be 0,10,20,...,90.

11c can be 0,11,22,...,99.

f can be 0-9.

On the right side: 10d -1. d is a digit, so 10d can be 0,10,...,90. So 10d -1 can be -1,9,19,...,89.

So, 10b +11c +f must equal 10d -1.

But 10b +11c +f is non-negative because digits are 0-9. So 10d -1 must also be non-negative. Hence, 10d -1 >=0 => d >=1.

So d is from 1 to 9.

So, 10d -1 can be 9,19,...,89.

So, 10b +11c +f must be 9,19,...,89.

But 10b +11c +f can range as follows:

10b: 0-90

11c: 0-99

f:0-9

So the minimum is 0+0+0=0, maximum is 90+99+9=198.

Wait, but in our case, 10b +11c +f =10d -1, which is between 9 and 89.

So, 10b +11c +f is between 9 and 89.

So, I can think of 10b +11c +f as equal to 10d -1, which is 9,19,...,89.

Hmm, perhaps I can write f =10d -1 -10b -11c.

Since f must be a digit (0-9), 10d -1 -10b -11c must be between 0 and 9.

So,

0 <= 10d -1 -10b -11c <=9.

Which implies,

10b +11c >=10d -1 -9,

and

10b +11c <=10d -1.

But 10d -1 is 9,19,...,89.

Wait, perhaps let me express this as:

10d -1 - (10b +11c) = f.

Since f is
