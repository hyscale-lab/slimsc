Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. All the sides are equal, and opposite sides are parallel. The problem mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, and the lengths of the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, what's a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel? Well, equilateral means all sides are equal, and opposite sides are parallel, so it's like a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or something. But since it's convex, all internal angles are less than 180 degrees.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, these are three sides of the hexagon, each separated by another side. When extended, they form a triangle. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

I remember that in such cases, the hexagon can be thought of as being "inscribed" in the triangle, with each pair of opposite sides being parallel to the sides of the triangle. Maybe the hexagon is similar in some way to the triangle, but scaled down.

Wait, maybe I should visualize this. If I have a triangle, and inside it, a hexagon where each pair of opposite sides is parallel to the triangle's sides. Since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are the same length, say 's'. So each of these sides is parallel to the corresponding sides of the triangle.

I think this is similar to the concept of similar triangles and maybe using ratios. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF is larger than the hexagon. So perhaps the hexagon is like a smaller version inside the triangle, scaled by some factor.

Let me denote the triangle as T with sides 200, 240, 300. Let me also denote the hexagon as H with side length 's'. Since H is inside T and has sides parallel to T's sides, the scaling factor would relate the sides of H to those of T.

Wait, but I need to think about how the hexagon is placed inside the triangle. Each side of H is between two sides of T. But since H has six sides, maybe each of its sides is between the extensions of two sides of T.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this using coordinates or vectors. But maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I remember something about areas and ratios.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the triangle being divided into smaller similar triangles by the hexagon. Each side of the hexagon would create a smaller similar triangle at each corner of the main triangle T.

Wait, but the hexagon is convex and equilateral, so maybe the sides of the hexagon are cutting the triangle into smaller triangles and parallelograms. Since opposite sides are parallel, each pair of opposite sides forms a set of parallel lines cutting the triangle into sections.

Wait, another approach: since all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel,
