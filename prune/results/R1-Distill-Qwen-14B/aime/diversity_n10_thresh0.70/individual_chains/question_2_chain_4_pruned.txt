Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

First, there are three points given: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is a point on the y-axis such that its y-coordinate is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866. 

Then, we're given a family of segments F, which consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant. Each P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ connects a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis, with the length of PQ being 1. 

I think this family F is like all possible such segments PQ where P is somewhere on the positive x-axis and Q is somewhere on the positive y-axis, but each PQ is exactly length 1. So, for each point P on the x-axis, there's a corresponding point Q on the y-axis such that PQ is 1 unit long, and vice versa.

Now, the problem says that there's a unique point C on segment AB, other than A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F except for AB itself. So, C is on AB, and for any other segment in F, C isn't on it. So, our goal is to find OCÂ², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p+q.

Hmm, okay. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, perhaps I should parametrize segment AB. Let me find the equation of line AB.

Points A and B are at (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of line AB is y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Alternatively, in intercept form, since it goes through (1/2,0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2), it's x/(1/2) + y/(sqrt(3)/2) = 1. That could also be written as 2x + (2/sqrt(3)) y = 1.

But maybe it's easier to parametrize AB parametrically. Let me consider a parameter t, where t=0 corresponds to point A and t=1 corresponds to point B. So, the parametric equations would be:

x = 1/2 - (1/2)t

y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t

So, when t=0, x=1/2, y=0 (point A), and when t=1, x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2 (point B). So, any point C on AB can be represented as (1/2 - (1/2)t, (sqrt(3)/2)t) for some t between 0 and 1.

Now, the point C is on AB, and it's not on any other segment from F except AB itself. So, we need to find such a point C where, for any other segment PQ in F, C is not on PQ unless PQ is AB itself.

Wait, but AB is itself a member of F? Let me check. AB is from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's compute the length of AB to see if it's a unit length segment.

The distance between A and B is sqrt( (1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/4) + (3/4) ) = sqrt(1) = 1. Yes, AB is indeed a member of F because it's a unit length segment from the x-axis to the y-axis.

So, F includes all such unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis, and AB is one of them. Now, any other segment PQ in F is from some point P(p,0) to some Q(0,q) where sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. So, each PQ has p >=0, q >=0, and p^2 + q^2=1.

So, the family F consists of all such segments. Now, the problem is saying that point C is on AB and is the unique point that does not
