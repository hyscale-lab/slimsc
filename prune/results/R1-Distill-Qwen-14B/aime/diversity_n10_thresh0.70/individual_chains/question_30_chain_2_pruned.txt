Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation ω^13 = 1. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Wait, no, actually, the cyclotomic polynomial for prime n is Φₙ(x) = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} + ... + x + 1. So for n=13, Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. That might come in handy later.

Now, looking at the product, it's from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Each term in the product is of the form 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me see if I can factor or simplify this expression somehow.

Let me consider each term: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this expression. Let's see: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, that looks a bit like a quadratic in terms of ω^k. Let me set z = ω^k. Then the term becomes z² - 2z + 2.

So, each term is z² - 2z + 2, where z is ω^k. So, the entire product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Now, since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, the powers ω^k for k=0 to 12 are all the distinct 13th roots of unity.

Wait a second, when k=0, ω^0 = 1, so that term becomes 1² - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So the first term is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So I can actually start the product from k=1 to 12, but let me confirm that.

Wait, the product is from k=0 to 12, so it includes k=0, which gives (2 - 2*1 + 1²) = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So, yes, the first term is 1, so the product is essentially the product from k=1 to 12 of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2).

But maybe there's a better way to handle this. Let me think about polynomials. If I consider the product over all roots, perhaps I can relate this to evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points.

Wait, since the roots are ω^k for k=1 to 12, perhaps I can write a polynomial whose roots are ω^k and then evaluate something at those roots. Let me think: If I have a polynomial P(x) = x¹³ - 1, then its roots are all 13th roots of unity, including 1. But since we're looking at ω^k for k=1 to 12, those are the roots of Φ₁₃(x) = (x¹³ -
