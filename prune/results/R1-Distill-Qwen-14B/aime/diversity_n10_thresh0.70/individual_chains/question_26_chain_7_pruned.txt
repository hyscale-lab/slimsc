Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem is about a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at B and C intersect at point D, and then line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10, and we need to find the length AP, expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me start by drawing a rough sketch based on the Asymptote figure provided. So, triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. Point D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, which makes D the exsimilicenter or the external homothety center of the circle ω with respect to points B and C. Then, line AD is drawn, and it intersects the circle again at P. So, AP is the segment we need to find.

I remember that in such problems, power of a point is often useful, especially since we have tangents involved. The power of point D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² and DC², since DB and DC are tangent lengths from D to ω. So, DB = DC. Wait, is that correct? Because D is the intersection of the two tangents, yes, so DB and DC are both tangent from D to ω, so they must be equal in length. That's a useful property.

So, power of point D gives us that DB² = DC² = (AD)(AP). Because when a line from D intersects the circle at A and P, the power of D is AD * DP, but since P is the other intersection, it's actually AD * DP. Wait, no, when you have a point outside the circle and a secant that goes through the circle, the power is equal to the product of the lengths from the point to each intersection. So, in this case, D is outside, and line DP intersects the circle at A and P. So, the power of D is DA * DP = DB².

Wait, but in this case, A is already on the circle, right? So, line AD starts at D, goes through A, and then intersects the circle again at P. So, the power of D would be DA * DP. So, yes, DA * DP = DB².

So, if we let AP = x, then since AD = AP + PD? Wait, no. Wait, point A is on the circle, so starting from D, going through A, then to P. So, the length from D to A is DA, and from D to P is DP. But since A is on the circle, DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is DA plus AP? Wait, no, that would be if A were between D and P, but actually, since P is on the circle and A is on the circle, and D is outside, the line
