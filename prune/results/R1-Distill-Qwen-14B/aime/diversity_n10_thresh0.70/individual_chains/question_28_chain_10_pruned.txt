Okay, so I've got this geometry problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given with specific lengths: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). The question is about finding the distance from a point I inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces, and this distance is the same for all faces. They mention that this distance can be written in a certain form, and I need to find the sum m + n + p where the distance is m√n / p.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter in a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius. So, my goal is to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

To find the inradius, I think I need to use the formula that relates the volume of the tetrahedron to its inradius and surface area. The formula should be similar to the one in 2D, where the area is equal to the inradius times the semiperimeter. In 3D, I believe the formula is Volume = (1/3) * Surface Area * inradius. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.

In 3D, the formula for the volume (V) is actually (1/3) times the total surface area (S) times the inradius (r). So, V = (1/3) * S * r. Therefore, solving for r gives r = (3V)/S, where S is the total surface area. So, I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area.

But wait, this tetrahedron has all opposite edges equal. AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. That seems symmetric. Maybe it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron. I think in such cases, the tetrahedron can be inscribed in a rectangular box or something, which might make calculating the volume easier.

I've heard that in such symmetric tetrahedrons, the volume can be found using the formula involving the product of the lengths of the edges. Maybe it's similar to the formula for the volume of a parallelepiped, but adjusted for a tetrahedron.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the tetrahedron in a coordinate system. Let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices in such a way that the symmetry is preserved. Let's place point A at (a, b, c), point B at (-a, -b, c), point C at (-a, b, -c), and point D at (a, -b, -c). This setup might make the opposite edges equal because of the symmetry.

Let me test this. So, for edge AB: distance between A and B is sqrt[(2a)^2 + (2b)^2 + 0^2] because the z-coordinates are the same. So, AB = sqrt(4a² + 4b²) = 2√(a² + b²). Similarly
