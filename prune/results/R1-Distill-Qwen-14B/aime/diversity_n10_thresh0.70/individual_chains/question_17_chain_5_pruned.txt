Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The final answer should be in the form p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, a rectangular box has length, width, and height. Let's denote them as x, y, z. So, the surface area of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54. The volume is xyz = 23.

I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain the box. The sphere must enclose the box completely. The smallest such sphere would have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a box is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, so r = d/2 = sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2. Therefore, r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, the problem reduces to minimizing (x² + y² + z²)/4, given the constraints 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Alternatively, since we're minimizing x² + y² + z², we can focus on that without the division by 4 for now.

So, the main goal is to minimize x² + y² + z² given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

I think using the method of Lagrange multipliers might be helpful here, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I can express variables in terms of each other and substitute.

Let me note the given equations:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 ⇒ xy + yz + xz = 27.
2. xyz = 23.

We need to minimize S = x² + y² + z².

I remember that for optimization problems with constraints, sometimes using inequalities like AM-GM can help, but I'm not sure if that directly applies here.

Wait, I also recall that for symmetric expressions, we can sometimes assume that the minimal occurs when x = y = z, but in this case, since the volume is 23 and surface area is 54, it's unlikely that x, y, z are equal because if they were, the surface area would be 6x² = 54 ⇒ x² = 9 ⇒ x = 3, and volume would be 27, which is more than 23. So, it's not a cube, so the minimal case probably isn't when all variables are equal.

Hmm, so maybe I can express one variable in terms of the others using the volume constraint and substitute into the surface area equation.

Let me solve for z from the volume equation: z = 23/(xy).

Substitute into the surface area equation: xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy)) = 27.

Simplify this:

xy + (23)/(x) + (23)/(y) = 27.

Hmm, that might not be too helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider using symmetric functions.

Let me denote S = x² + y² + z², and I know that (x + y + z)^2 = S + 2(xy + yz + xz). Since I know xy + yz + xz = 27, then (x + y + z)^2 = S + 54. So, if I can minimize S, I can relate it to the sum x + y + z.

But I don't know x + y + z, so maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers with two constraints. Wait, but actually, I have
