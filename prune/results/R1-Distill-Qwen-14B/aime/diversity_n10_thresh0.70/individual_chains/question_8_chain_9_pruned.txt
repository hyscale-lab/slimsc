Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me break it down.

First, let me understand what's given. The first equation is linear, which is simpler, and the second one is a combination of terms with a², b², and c² multiplied by the other variables. Maybe I can find a way to relate these two equations.

I remember that sometimes when dealing with symmetric expressions, it's helpful to consider symmetric substitutions or to factor them. Let me write down the second equation again:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Looking at this, each term is a product of a square of one variable and another variable. So, for example, a²b and a²c are both terms with a². Similarly for the others. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow.

Let me group the terms by the squared variable:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that looks better. Now, from the first equation, I know that a + b + c = 300, so I can express, say, b + c as 300 - a, and similarly for the others.

So substituting that into the second equation, I get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me write that out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression further. Let me factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 300 to simplify:

a² + b² + c² - (1/300)(a³ + b³ + c³) = 20,000.

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe instead of dividing, I can find a relationship between a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³.

I recall that for three variables, there's an identity involving a³ + b³ + c³. Let me think. Oh yes, the identity:

a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ac).

But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here, but perhaps I can find an expression for a² + b² + c².

From the first equation, a + b + c = 300. Let me square both sides:

(a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac) = 300² = 90,000.

So, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac).

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ac, and P = abc. Maybe these symmetric sums can help.

So, going back to the second equation, which we rewrote as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me express a² + b² + c² in terms of Q: a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2Q.

So, substitute that in:

300(90,000 - 2Q) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Calculate 300 times 90,000: 300 * 90,000 = 27,000,000.

300 times -2Q is -600Q. So:

27,000,000 - 600Q - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Bring the 27,000,000 to the other side:

-600Q - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000 - 27,000,000 = -21,000,000.

Multiply both sides by (-1):

600Q + (a³ + b³ + c³) = 21,000,000.

Hmm, okay, so now I have an equation involving Q and the sum of cubes.

I need to relate a³ + b³ + c³ to Q and S. As I thought earlier, the identity:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc.

Which is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SQ + 3P.

Given that S = 300, let's substitute that in:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P.

Compute 300³: 300*300=90,000, 90,000*300=27,000,000.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P.

Now, substituting back into the equation:

600Q + (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P) = 21,000,000.

Combine like terms:

600Q - 900Q = -300Q.

So:

-300Q + 27,000,000 + 3P = 21,000,000.

Subtract 21,000,000 from both sides:

-300Q + 3P = -6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

-100Q + P = -2,000,000.

So, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

Hmm, so now we have:

P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

But P is abc, the product of a, b, and c. And Q is ab + bc + ac.

I wonder if I can find possible values for Q and P. But I'm not sure yet. Maybe another approach would help.

Wait, let's think about the equation a + b + c = 300 and the equation a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2Q.

We also have that a²b + a²c + ... etc. equals 6,000,000. But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider substituting variables. Let me set x = a, y = b, z = c. So, x + y + z = 300, and we have another equation involving x²y + x²z + y²x + y²z + z²x + z²y = 6,000,000.

Wait, is there a way to factor this expression? Let me try factoring:

x²y + x²z + y²x + y²z + z²x + z²y.

Factor by grouping:

x²(y + z) + y²(x + z) + z²(x + y).

But since x + y + z = 300, y + z = 300 - x,
