Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the conditions.

The problem says: There's a list of positive integers with three main properties.

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9, which means 9 appears more frequently than any other number, and no other number shares this mode.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

And the question is asking for the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Alright, let's break this down. I think I should first recall some definitions to make sure I'm on the right track.

First, the mode of a list is the number that appears most frequently. So, unique mode means only one number has the highest frequency, and in this case, that number is 9. So 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list. For example, if 9 appears twice, then all other numbers can appear at most once. But if 9 appears three times, others can appear up to two times, but not three.

Second, the median is the middle number when the list is ordered. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If it's even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But wait, the problem says the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. Hmm, that's interesting. So, if the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which must be an integer, but that average isn't present in the list. Alternatively, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, which is an integer and doesn't appear in the list. Wait, that can't be right because the middle number is in the list, so the median would have to be in the list. So, that suggests that the list must have an even number of elements because then the median is an average of two numbers and might not be present. Let me think about that.

Wait, if the list has an even number of elements, say 2n, the median is the average of the nth and (n+1)th terms. So, if the two middle numbers are both integers, their average can be an integer only if they are both even or both odd. But the median is an integer that does not appear in the list. So, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, the median would be 9, which doesn't appear in the list. So that's possible. So, that's a possibility. So the list must have an even number of elements because with an odd number, the median is one of the elements, which would have to appear, but the problem says the median is a positive integer not in the list. So that tells me the list must have even length. So, the length is even.

Now, let's think about the mode. Since the unique mode is 9, 9 must appear more times
