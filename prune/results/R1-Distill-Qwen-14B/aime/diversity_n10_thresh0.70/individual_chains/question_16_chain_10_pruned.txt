Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:

"Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p²."

Hmm, so first, I need to find the smallest prime p where there's some positive integer n where p² divides n⁴ + 1. Then, once I find that p, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Alright, let's break this down. I think I should start by checking small prime numbers and see if any of them satisfy the condition that p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n.

First, let's list some small primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. I can start checking them one by one.

Let me start with p=2. If p=2, then we need to find n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by 4. Let's check some small n:

n=1: 1 + 1 = 2. 2 is not divisible by 4.
n=2: 16 + 1 = 17. 17 mod 4 is 1, so not divisible.
n=3: 81 + 1 = 82. 82 mod 4 is 2, still not divisible.
Wait, but n=0 would give 0 + 1 = 1, which is 1 mod 4. So none of the n's for p=2 seem to give n⁴ + 1 divisible by 4. Hmm, so p=2 might not satisfy the condition. Or maybe I'm missing something. Wait, let's see. n^4 is always 0 or 1 mod 4, because:

n even: n=2k, n^4 = (2k)^4 = 16k^4 ≡ 0 mod 4
n odd: n=2k+1, n^4 = (2k+1)^4. Let's compute mod 4.

(2k+1)^4 = 16k^4 + 32k^3 + 24k^2 + 8k + 1.

But 16, 32, 24, 8 are all multiples of 4, so mod 4, it's just 1.

So n even: n^4 ≡ 0 mod 4, so n^4 +1 ≡ 1 mod 4.
n odd: n^4 ≡ 1 mod 4, so n^4 +1 ≡ 2 mod 4.

Neither case gives 0 mod 4. Therefore, n^4 +1 is never divisible by 4 for any integer n. So p=2 is out.

Next prime is p=3. Let's check if there's an n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by 9.

We can compute n^4 mod 9 for n=1,2,...,8 since mod 9 cycles every 9 numbers.

Compute n^4 mod 9:

n=1: 1^4=1 → 1 mod9
n=2: 16 mod9 =7
n=3: 81 mod9=0
n=4: 256 mod9. Wait, 4^4=256. 256 ÷9: 9*28=252, 256-252=4. So 4 mod9.

n=5: 5^4=625. 625 ÷9: 9*69=621, 625-621=4. So 4 mod9
