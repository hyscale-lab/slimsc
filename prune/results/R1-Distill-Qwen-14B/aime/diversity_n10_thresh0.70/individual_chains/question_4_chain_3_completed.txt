Alright, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, okay, so this is a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that these types of problems often involve figuring out "winning positions" and "losing positions." A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, regardless of what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite—the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

Since Alice goes first, for Bob to have a winning strategy, the starting position n must be a losing position for Alice. So, I need to find all n ≤ 2024 such that the starting player (Alice) is in a losing position, meaning Bob can always win.

Let me think about how to determine whether a position is winning or losing. It might help to look for a pattern by examining small values of n and seeing who would win in each case.

Let's list out the possible n from 0 upwards and mark whether it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

n=0: Well, if there are zero tokens, the game is already over. But since the last token taken wins, n=0 is a losing position because the player to move can't make a move and thus loses. So n=0 is L.

n=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is W.

n=2: Take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. Wait, no—that's not right. If I take 1 token from 2, leaving 1, the opponent can take that 1 and win. Alternatively, if I take 1, opponent takes 1 and wins. So n=2 is W because the player can take 1, but wait, the opponent can then take the last one. No, wait, if n=2, the player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. So the player would lose. So n=2 is actually L? Wait, no, no, wait: If n=2, the player can take 1, leaving 1. The opponent can take 1 and win, so the player loses. Alternatively, can the player take 4? No, because n=2, so taking 4 isn't an option. So the only move is to take 1, which leads to opponent winning. So n=2 is a losing position? Or wait, maybe I messed up.

Wait another way: The player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent. Then the opponent can take that last 1 and win. So n=2 is a losing position for the current player because whatever they do, the opponent can win. So n=2 is L.

n=3: The player can take 1, leaving 2, which is a losing position for the opponent. Because from 2, the opponent can only take 1, leaving 1, which the player can then take and win. Wait, no, let's double-check.

If n=3, player takes 1, leaving 2. From n=2, the opponent can take 1, leaving 1, which the player can then take and win. So by taking 1 from n=3, the player can force a win. Alternatively, could the player take 4? No, because n=3. So taking 1 is the only move. So n=3 is W.

n=4: The player can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So n=4 is W.

n=5: The player can take 1, leaving 4. Since 4 is a winning position for the opponent, the opponent can take all 4 and win. Alternatively, the player could take 4, leaving 1, which is a winning position for the opponent (they take 1 and win). So n=5: whatever the player does (take 1 or 4), the opponent can win. So n=5 is L.

Wait, is that right? Let's see:

If n=5, player's options:

- Take 1, leaving 4. Opponent takes 4 and wins.

- Take 4, leaving 1. Opponent takes 1 and wins.

So yes, both moves let the opponent win. So n=5 is L.

n=6: The player can take 1, leaving 5, which is a losing position for the opponent. So the player can force a win by taking 1. So n=6 is W.

n=7: Player can take 1, leaving 6 (W for opponent), or take 4, leaving 3 (W for opponent). Wait, both options leave the opponent in a winning position. So n=7 is L?

Wait, no. Let's check:

If n=7, player takes 1, leaving 6 (W). So opponent can win from 6. Alternatively, player takes 4, leaving 3 (W). So opponent can win either way. So n=7 is L.

Wait, hmm, but let's see:

If the player takes 1, opponent is at 6, which is W. So opponent can take 1, leaving 5 (L). Then the player is forced into a losing position.

Wait, maybe I need to rethink.

Wait, actually, the idea is that if from the current position, all possible moves lead to the opponent being able to win (i.e., all possible next positions are W for the opponent), then the current position is L.

So for n=7:

- Take 1 → n=6 (W for opponent)
- Take 4 → n=3 (W for opponent)

So both moves lead to opponent being able to win, so n=7 is L.

n=8: The player can take 1, leaving 7 (L). So opponent is in a losing position, meaning the player can force a win. So n=8 is W.

n=9: The player can take 1, leading to 8 (W), or take 4, leading to 5 (L). So if the player takes 4, leaving 5 (L), then opponent is in a losing position. So n=9 is W.

Wait, is that correct? So from n=9, taking 4 leads to n=5, which is L. So the current player can force the opponent into a losing position. So n=9 is W.

n=10: The player can take 1, leading to 9 (W), or take 4, leading to 6 (W). So both moves leave the opponent in a W position. So n=10 is L.

Wait, let me confirm:

- Take 1 → n=9 (W)
- Take 4 → n=6 (W)

So both options leave opponent in a W position, meaning n=10 is L.

Wait, so let's list out the positions from 0 to 10:

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

W/L: L W L W W L W L W W L

Hmm, I see a pattern emerging, but it's not immediately obvious. Let's continue a few more to see.

n=11: Player can take 1 → n=10 (L), which is a losing position for opponent. So n=11 is W.

n=12: Player can take 1 → n=11 (W), or take 4 → n=8 (W). So both moves leave opponent in W. So n=12 is L.

Wait, no: if from n=12, taking 1 leads to 11 (W), and taking 4 leads to 8 (W). So all moves lead to opponent being able to win. So n=12 is L.

n=13: Player can take 1 → 12 (L), so opponent is in losing position. So n=13 is W.

n=14: Player can take 1 → 13 (W), or take 4 → 10 (L). So if player takes 4, leaving 10 (L), opponent is in a losing position. So n=14 is W.

n=15: Player can take 1 → 14 (W), or take 4 → 11 (W). So all options leave opponent in W position. So n=15 is L.

n=16: Player can take 1 → 15 (L), so opponent is in losing position. So n=16 is W.

n=17: Player can take 1 → 16 (W), or take 4 → 13 (W). So all options lead to opponent in W. So n=17 is L.

n=18: Player can take 1 → 17 (L), so opponent is in losing position. So n=18 is W.

n=19: Player can take 1 → 18 (W), or take 4 → 15 (L). So if player takes 4, leaving opponent at 15 (L), so n=19 is W.

n=20: Player can take 1 → 19 (W), or take 4 → 16 (W). So all moves lead to opponent in W. So n=20 is L.

Hmm, compiling the list:

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

W/L: L W L W W L W L W W L W L W W L W L W W L

Looking at this, perhaps the losing positions are at n=0,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...

Wait, looking at the losing positions: 0,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...

The differences between consecutive losing positions:

5-0=5

7-5=2

10-7=3

12-10=2

15-12=3

17-15=2

20-17=3

Hmm, alternating between adding 2 and 3.

So the losing positions are 0, then 5, then 7 (5+2), then 10 (7+3), then 12 (10+2), 15 (12+3), 17 (15+2), 20 (17+3), etc.

So the pattern seems to be adding 2, then 3, repeating. So the losing positions are every 5, then 7, then 10, then 12, etc.

So the losing positions can be described as numbers congruent to 0 mod 5? Wait, no: 5 is 0 mod5, 7 is 2 mod5, 10 is 0 mod5, 12 is 2 mod5, 15 is 0 mod5, 17 is 2 mod5, 20 is 0 mod5. Hmm, so the losing positions are numbers that are either 0 or 2 mod5? But wait, 5 is 0 mod5, 7 is 2, 10 is 0, 12 is 2, 15 is 0, etc.

Wait, but 5,7,10,12,15,17,20, etc., so 0 mod5 and 2 mod5? So losing positions are numbers where n mod5 is 0 or 2.

Wait, let's check:

n=0: 0 mod5 → L

n=5: 0 mod5 → L

n=7: 2 mod5 (7%5=2) → L

n=10: 0 mod5 → L

n=12: 2 mod5 → L

Yes, seems so. So perhaps the losing positions are when n ≡ 0 or 2 mod5.

But wait, let's test n=1 (1 mod5: 1) → W

n=2: 2 mod5 → L

Wait, n=2 is 2 mod5 and is a losing position, but according to the earlier list, n=2 is L. So the initial pattern may hold. Wait, but earlier positions:

Wait, n=2: L

n=5: L

n=7: L

n=10: L

n=12: L

n=15: L

n=17: L

n=20: L

So the losing positions are n ≡ 0 mod5 or n ≡ 2 mod5.

So for n ≥ 0, if n mod5 is 0 or 2, then it's a losing position.

But wait, let's check n=2, which is 2 mod5, and is L.

n=7 is 2 mod5 (7%5=2), which is 2 again. Wait, 7 mod5 is 2.

Wait, 12 mod5 is 2 as well.

Wait, but 17 mod5 is 2, 22 mod5 is 2, etc. So the losing positions are at n=5k and n=5k+2.

Wait, but n=2 is 5*0 +2, yes. So the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Is that correct? Let's see.

So, to confirm, for any n:

If n ≡0 or 2 mod5 → losing position

Else → winning position.

Let me check n=21:

n=21: 21 mod5 is 1 → W. Let's see:

n=21, player can take 1 → 20 (L), so opponent is in losing position. So 21 is W. Which aligns with the rule.

n=22: 22 mod5=2 → L. Let's see:

From 22, all possible moves:

Take 1 →21 (W)

Take4 →18 (W)

So both moves leave opponent in W, so 22 is L. Which fits.

n=23: 23 mod5=3 → W.

From n=23, player can take 1 →22 (L), which is a losing position for opponent. So n=23 is W.

n=24: 24 mod5=4 → W.

Player can take 1 →23 (W), or take4 →20 (L). So taking4 leads to opponent L. So n=24 is W.

n=25: 25 mod5=0 → L.

So from 25, all moves:

Take1 →24 (W)

Take4 →21 (W)

So both moves leave opponent in W, so n=25 is L. Correct.

So yes, the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, in the game, if n is a losing position (n ≡0 or 2 mod5), then the current player cannot force a win assuming the opponent plays optimally.

Given that, since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position, Bob can win regardless of Alice's moves.

So the problem is to find the number of positive integers n ≤2024 such that n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So we need to count how many numbers from 1 to 2024 are congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.

Let's calculate how many numbers ≤2024 are ≡0 mod5 and ≡2 mod5.

First, count numbers ≡0 mod5:

The smallest is 5, then 10, 15,... up to ≤2024.

The largest multiple of 5 ≤2024 is 2020, since 2020=5×404.

So the count is 404 numbers.

Similarly, numbers ≡2 mod5:

The sequence starts at 2,7,12,... up to the largest ≤2024.

What is the largest number ≤2024 that is 2 mod5?

2024 divided by5 is 404.8. So 5×404=2020, 2020+2=2022.

So the last term is2022.

So the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.

How many terms are there?

The sequence can be written as 5k+2, where k starts at0.

So when 5k+2 ≤2024 →5k ≤2022 →k ≤404.4. So k can be 0,1,...,404.

So that's 405 terms.

Wait, because k starts at0: when k=0, n=2; k=404, n=5×404 +2=2022.

So the number of terms is 405.

So total numbers ≡0 or2 mod5 up to2024 is 404 +405= 809.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

Numbers ≡0 mod5: 5,10,...,2020 → total terms: 2020/5=404. So 404 numbers.

Numbers ≡2 mod5: 2,7,12,...,2022.

The nth term of this sequence is a_n=5n-3 (when n=1: 2, n=2:7, etc.).

Wait, maybe it's better to model it as an arithmetic sequence.

First term a=2, common difference d=5. The nth term is a + (n-1)d=2 +5(n-1)=5n-3.

We want the largest n such that 5n-3 ≤2024 →5n ≤2027 →n≤405.4. So n=405.

Therefore, 405 numbers ≡2 mod5.

So total numbers is404 +405=809.

Wait, but let me confirm with another method.

The total numbers ≤2024 is2024.

Numbers not ≡0 or2 mod5: those ≡1,3,4 mod5.

Each residue mod5 occurs approximately 2024/5=404.8 times.

But exact counts:

Numbers ≡0 mod5: floor(2024/5)=404.

Numbers ≡2 mod5: floor((2024 +3)/5)= floor(2027/5)=405.

Wait, because for numbers ≡r mod5, the count is floor((N - r)/5) +1.

So for r=0:

floor(2024/5)=404.

For r=2:

floor((2024 -2)/5) +1= floor(2022/5) +1=404 +1=405.

Hence, 404 +405=809.

So the number of n ≤2024 where n≡0 or2 mod5 is809.

But wait, the problem statement says "positive integers n". So n starts at1.

But in our earlier analysis, n=0 is a losing position, but n=0 is not positive, so it's not included.

Wait, but for numbers ≡0 mod5: the first number is5, which is positive, so 404 numbers are from5,10,...2020.

For numbers ≡2 mod5: the first is2, which is positive, then7,12,...2022. So 405 numbers.

So 404 +405=809 positive integers n≤2024 where Bob can force a win.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure that n=0 is excluded. Because in the problem statement, n is a positive integer, so n starts at1.

But in our analysis, n=0 was a losing position, but since n=0 isn't allowed, the first losing position is n=2.

So n=2 is included, which is positive, so our counts are correct.

Hence, the answer is809.

Wait, but let me just think again. Because the initial list from n=0 to n=20 shows that losing positions start at0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... So the positive integers are2,5,7,10,12,... So the total count is indeed 404 (for ≡0) and405 (for≡2), totaling809.

So the answer should be809.

Wait, but let me compute 404 +405=809.

Yes, 809.

But wait, let me verify with an alternative approach:

Total numbers=2024.

Number of losing positions= floor(N/5)*2 + extra.

Wait, for each block of5 numbers:

In each block of5 numbers, two are losing positions: one ≡0, one≡2.

So in 2024, how many complete blocks of5 are there?

2024 divided by5 is404.8, so 404 complete blocks, each contributing2 losing positions: 404 ×2=808.

Then, the remaining numbers are 2024 - (5×404)=2024-2020=4 numbers: 2021,2022,2023,2024.

In these remaining 4 numbers:

2021: 2021 mod5=1 → W

2022:2022 mod5=2 → L

2023:2023 mod5=3 → W

2024:2024 mod5=4 → W

So only 2022 is a losing position in the last partial block.

So total losing positions:404×2 +1=809.

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where Bob can guarantee a win is809.


Alice and Bob play a game with a stack of $n$ tokens, taking turns to remove 1 or 4 tokens. The player who removes the last token wins. We need to determine how many positive integers $n \leq 2024$ allow Bob to guarantee a win, regardless of Alice's play.

To solve this, we analyze the game using combinatorial game theory. We identify "winning positions" (W) and "losing positions" (L). A losing position is one where the current player cannot force a win, assuming optimal play by the opponent.

By examining small values of $n$, we observe a pattern in the losing positions. The losing positions are numbers congruent to $0$ or $2 \mod 5$. This means that if $n \equiv 0 \mod 5$ or $n \equiv 2 \mod 5$, the current player is in a losing position.

To find the total number of such $n \leq 2024$:
1. Count the numbers $\equiv 0 \mod 5$: These are $5, 10, 15, \ldots, 2020$. There are $\lfloor 2024 / 5 \rfloor = 404$ such numbers.
2. Count the numbers $\equiv 2 \mod 5$: These are $2, 7, 12, \ldots, 2022$. The count is $\lfloor (2024 - 2) / 5 \rfloor + 1 = 405$ such numbers.

Adding these, we get $404 + 405 = 809$ positive integers $n \leq 2024$ where Bob can guarantee a win.

$\boxed{809}$
