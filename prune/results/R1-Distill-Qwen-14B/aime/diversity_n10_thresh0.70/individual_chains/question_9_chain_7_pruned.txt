Okay, so I have this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x is equal to 10, and log base y of x^{4y} is also equal to 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be converted using the change of base formula. Maybe that will help here. Let me write down the two equations given.

Equation 1: log_x(y^x) = 10

Equation 2: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I think I can simplify both equations using logarithm properties. Let me recall that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So applying that to both equations.

Starting with Equation 1: log_x(y^x) = 10

Using the property, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10

Similarly, Equation 2: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

Which becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Now, I have these two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10

2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, I notice that log_x(y) and log_y(x) are reciprocals of each other. Because log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, if I let log_x(y) = k, then log_y(x) = 1/k. Maybe that substitution will help.

Let me denote log_x(y) = k. Then log_y(x) = 1/k.

Substituting into the equations:

Equation 1 becomes: x * k = 10

Equation 2 becomes: 4y * (1/k) = 10

So now, I have:

x * k = 10 --> equation A

4y / k = 10 --> equation B

From equation A, I can express x in terms of k: x = 10 / k

From equation B, I can express y in terms of k: 4y = 10k --> y = (10k) / 4 = (5k)/2

Now, I have x and y expressed in terms of k. But I also know that log_x(y) = k. So, I can substitute x and y in terms of k into that logarithmic expression.

log_x(y) = k

Which is equivalent to x^k = y, because log_b(a) = c implies b^c = a.

Wait, that's a good point. So, if log_x(y) = k, then y = x^k.

But I already have x = 10/k and y = (5k)/2. So I can set these equal:

x^k = y

Substituting x and y:

(10/k)^k = (5k)/2

Hmm, that's a bit complicated equation. Let's see if I can simplify it.

Take both sides and write them as exponents:

(10/k)^k = (5k)/2

Hmm, not sure about that. Maybe taking natural logs on both sides would help, but that might get messy. Let me try that.

Take ln of both sides:

ln[(10/k)^k] = ln[(5k)/2]

Simplify left side: k * ln(10/k) = ln(5k/2)

So, k * [ln(10) - ln(k)] = ln(5k/2)

Let me expand both sides:

Left side: k ln(10) - k ln(k)

Right side: ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2)

Hmm, this is getting complicated, but maybe I can rearrange terms.

Bring all terms to one side:

k ln(10) - k ln(k) - ln(5) - ln(k) + ln(2) = 0

Factor terms where possible:

k (ln(10) - ln(k)) - ln(5) + ln(2) - ln(k) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can group the ln(k) terms:

k ln(10) - (k + 1) ln(k) - (ln(5) - ln(2)) = 0

Wait, ln(5) - ln(2) is ln(5/2), so:

k ln(10) - (k + 1) ln(k) - ln(5/2) = 0

This seems a bit unwieldy. Maybe I can make a substitution. Let me let t = ln(k). Then k = e^t.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can assume that k is a nice integer or fraction. Since x and y are greater than 1, and the logs are 10, perhaps k is an integer. Let me test some integer values.

Let me try k=2.

Then:

Left side: 2 ln(10) - 2 ln(2) ≈ 2*(2.302585) - 2*(0.693147) ≈ 4.60517 - 1.386294 ≈ 3.218876

Right side: ln(5*2/2) = ln(5) ≈
