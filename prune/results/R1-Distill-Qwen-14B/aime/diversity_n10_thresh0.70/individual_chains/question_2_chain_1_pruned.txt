Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all parts.

We have points O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis at (1/2, 0), and B is on the y-axis at (0, sqrt(3)/2). Then, there's a family F of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant. Each PQ has P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, these are like line segments from some point P(p, 0) to some point Q(0, q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the distance between P and Q is 1.

The problem says there's a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F except for AB itself. So, C is only on AB and no other segments from the family F. We need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express that as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.

Hmm, okay. So, I think the first step is to find the equation of segment AB because point C is on AB. Then, I need to find which point C on AB isn't covered by any other segment PQ in the family F except for AB itself.

Let me first find the equation of AB.

Point A is (1/2, 0) and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplifying that, y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2).

So, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) for x between 0 and 1/2.

Now, I need to find the point C such that it's only on AB and no other PQ in F. So, for any other PQ in F, the point C isn't on PQ. So, if I can find such a point, that's our C.

Since all PQ segments are of unit length, from the x-axis to the y-axis, we can parametrize them. Let me think about how these segments look.

A general segment PQ in F connects (p, 0) to (0, q), with sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. Since it's in the first quadrant, p and q are positive. So, for each such segment, the equation is (x/p) + (y/q) = 1. That's the intercept form of the line equation.

So, the family F consists of all lines (x/p) + (y/q) = 1 where p² + q² = 1 and p, q > 0.

Point C is on AB, so plugging into AB's equation, we have C = (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2). So, if this point C is on another segment PQ from F, then substituting into PQ's equation must satisfy (x/p) + (y/q) = 1.

But we want C to not lie on any other PQ except AB. So, for C, the equation (x/p) + (y/q) = 1 must have only one solution, which corresponds to AB.

Wait, but AB is also in F? Because AB is from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's check if AB is in F. The length of AB is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So, yes, AB is a member of F. So, C is on AB, which is in F, but we don't want C to be on any other PQ in F.

Therefore, for point C, the system of equations (x/p) + (y/q) = 1 and y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 should have only one solution, which is when PQ is AB itself.

Wait, but maybe that's not the exact approach. Alternatively, for each C on AB, except A and B, we need that there's no other segment PQ in F passing through C. So, we need to find a point C where the only segment PQ in F passing through it is AB.

So, perhaps when C is such that the line AB is the only line in F passing through C. So, maybe at that point, AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F.

Wait, the family F is a set of lines. The envelope of such lines might form a curve, and the point C would lie on this envelope, making AB tangent to it.

Alternatively, perhaps the envelope of the family F is a curve, and the point C is where AB is tangent to this envelope. So, the point C is the point of tangency.

So, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. In this case, the family F is all lines (x/p) + (y/q) = 1 with p² + q² =
