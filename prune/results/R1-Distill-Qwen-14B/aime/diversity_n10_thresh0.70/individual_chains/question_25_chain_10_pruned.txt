Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, it's a bit confusing, but I'll take it step by step.

First, the problem states that there are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's a given for everyone. But besides that, some own other things: diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 respectively. 

Then, it says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. I need to find how many own all four—so that would be all four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Wait, but candy hearts are already owned by everyone, so owning all four means they also own the other three. Hmm, okay.

I remember from set theory that we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve problems like this. Maybe that's the way to go. Let me recall how that works.

Inclusion-exclusion for four sets... Well, the formula for four sets A, B, C, D is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| 
- |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |A ∩ D| - |B ∩ C| - |B ∩ D| - |C ∩ D|
+ |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ D|
- |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|

But wait, in this problem, everyone owns a candy heart. So, D is the set of all 900 residents. Because D is the candy hearts, which every resident has. So, in this case, any intersection involving D is just the set of people who have the other items. For example, A ∩ D is just A, since A is a subset of D.

So, since D is the universal set here, the total number of people in A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D is equal to the total number of residents, which is 900. Because D is everyone.

So, the formula simplifies. Let me write that out.

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| 
- |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C|
+ |A ∩ B ∩ C|

But in our problem, since D is everyone, the union is 900. So, we can write:

900 = |A| + |B| + |C| 
- |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C|
+ |A ∩ B ∩ C|

Wait, but I don't know |A ∩ B|,
