Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me, and it's about finding the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions given are a bit complicated, but I think I can break them down step by step.

First, let me parse the functions they've given. The function f(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/2|, and g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. Then, the two graphs to consider are y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). I need to find how many times these two graphs intersect.

Hmm, intersections mean that for some (x, y), both equations are satisfied. So, substituting one into the other might help. But I'm not sure yet. Maybe I should first try to understand what f and g look like.

Let me start by plotting f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The inner function is |x|, which is a V-shape with its vertex at (0,0). Then subtract 1/2: |x| - 1/2. That would shift the graph down by 1/2. But since we're taking the absolute value again, it would reflect any negative parts back up. So, f(x) would have a V-shape with its vertex at (0, -1/2), but after taking absolute value, it becomes two Vs. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the graph of |x| is V-shaped with vertex at (0,0). Let's say we have |x| - 1/2. This would lower the entire graph by 1/2. So, for x between -1/2 and 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative. So, when we take the absolute value again, it becomes positive. So, f(x) would have a W-like shape, maybe? Let me sketch it mentally.

At x=0, f(0) is |0 - 1/2| = 1/2. At x=1/2, f(1/2) is |1/2 - 1/2| = 0. At x=1, f(1) is |1 - 1/2| = 1/2. Similarly, at x=-1/2, f(-1/2) is |1/2 - 1/2| = 0, and at x=-1, f(-1) is |1 - 1/2| = 1/2. So the graph of f(x) is a V shape between x=-1/2 and x=1/2, dipping down to 0 at x=±1/2, and then V shapes again beyond that, reaching 1/2 at x=±1, and so on. So it's like a series of Vs, each centered at x=0, ±1, ±2, etc., with the minimum at ±1/2, ±3/2, etc.

Similarly, for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|, the same logic applies. The graph of |x| is V-shaped. Subtracting 1/4, so the graph shifts down by 1/4. Then taking absolute value again, any parts below zero are reflected upwards. So, for x between -1/4 and 1/4, |x| - 1/4 is negative, so it becomes | |x| - 1/4 |, which is 1/4 - |x|. So, the graph of g(x) will have a V shape between x=-1/4 and x=1/4, dipping down to 0 at x=±1/4, and then beyond that, it's |x| - 1/4, so it's V-shaped like the original |x| but shifted down by 1/4 and then taking absolute value.

So, f(x) has minima at x=±(2k+1)/2 for integers k, and g(x) has minima at x=±(2k+1)/4 for integers k.

Now, the functions involved in the problem are 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

Wait, but let's make sure: the first function is y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))), and the second is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So, each is a composition of functions, starting with sin or cos, then applying f, then g, then scaling by 4.

I need to find the number of points (x, y) where y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So, substituting y from the first equation into the second, we get x = 4g(f(cos(3π * y))), where y is 4g(f(sin(2πx))). That seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ranges and properties of these functions to understand how many solutions there are.

First, let's analyze the inner functions.

Let me think about f(sin(2πx)).

Since sin(2πx) ranges between -1 and 1. Then, f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx) - 1/2||.

Similarly, g(f(sin(2πx))) = || ||sin(2πx) - 1/2|| - 1/4||.

So, let's see: the function inside g
