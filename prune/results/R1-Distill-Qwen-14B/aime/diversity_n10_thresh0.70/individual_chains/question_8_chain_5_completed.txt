Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and another equation involving a, b, c: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let's try to break it down.

First, I remember that when dealing with equations that have symmetric expressions, sometimes factoring or using symmetric sums can help. The first condition is a + b + c = 300, which is straightforward. The second condition looks more complex. Let me write it out again:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Wait, that expression seems symmetric in a, b, c. Maybe I can factor it or express it in terms of symmetric sums. Let me see if I can factor it.

Looking at the terms, each term is of the form x²y, where x and y are distinct variables. So, the expression is the sum over all x ≠ y of x²y. Let's see if there's another way to write this.

I recall that sometimes expressions like this can be expressed as (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc. Let me check:

(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab + bc + ca) + b(ab + bc + ca) + c(ab + bc + ca)
= a²b + a b c + a²c + a b² + b²c + b c a + a c² + b c² + c²a.

Wait, that seems like more terms. Let me compute it step by step:

(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ca) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ca)
= a²b + abc + a²c + ab² + b²c + abc + abc + bc² + c²a.

So, that's = a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + bc² + c²a + 3abc.

But the expression we have is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Comparing, that's exactly the same as the first part, without the 3abc. So,

(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = (a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + bc² + c²a) + 3abc.

Which means that:

a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + bc² + c²a = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.

So, substituting into our second equation:

(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

We know that a + b + c = 300, so:

300 * (ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Let me write this as:

300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

I can factor out a 3:

3[100(ab + bc + ca) - abc] = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

So, now we have:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, let's denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ca.

So, our equation becomes:

100Q - P = 2,000,000.

We can write this as:

100Q = P + 2,000,000.

Or,

P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

So, our variables are related by this equation. Now, I remember that for three variables, we can use the relationships between S, Q, and P. Specifically, for a cubic equation with roots a, b, c, it would be x³ - Sx² + Qx - P = 0. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

Alternatively, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, maybe we can find possible values of Q and P that satisfy the equation P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

But we also know that S = a + b + c = 300, so perhaps we can express Q in terms of a, b, c.

Wait, let's think about possible ranges for Q and P. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers summing to 300, their maximum possible product is when two are as large as possible, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express Q in terms of S and the pairwise products. But I don't think that's directly helpful.

Wait, maybe we can express Q in terms of S and the variance or something else, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, let's consider that Q = ab + bc + ca. Since a + b + c = 300, perhaps we can find some bounds on Q.

We know that for nonnegative integers a, b, c with a fixed sum S, the maximum of Q occurs when two variables are as equal as possible and the third is as small as possible. Wait, actually, for Q = ab + bc + ca, the maximum occurs when two variables are equal and the third is zero. Let me check: suppose c = 0, then Q = ab. With a + b = 300, the maximum ab is when a = b = 150, so ab = 22500. So Q can be up to 22500.

Wait, but that's if c is zero. Alternatively, when all three variables are equal, a = b = c = 100, then Q = 3*(100*100) = 30,000.

Hmm, so Q can be as high as 30,000 and as low as... Well, when two variables are 1 and 299, and the third is 0, then Q = 1*299 + 299*0 + 0*1 = 299. So Q can be as low as zero (if two variables are zero) or up to 30,000.

Wait, but in our case, since the equation is 100Q - P = 2,000,000, and P = abc, which is nonnegative because a, b, c are nonnegative. So, 100Q must be at least 2,000,000, so Q must be at least 20,000.

So, Q ≥ 20,000.

But earlier, I saw that the maximum Q is 30,000. So Q must be between 20,000 and 30,000.

So, 20,000 ≤ Q ≤ 30,000.

Given that, let's see what possible Q's we can have. Since Q is an integer, and from the equation P = 100Q - 2,000,000, which must also be a nonnegative integer because P = abc is nonnegative.

So, 100Q must be ≥ 2,000,000, so Q ≥ 20,000.

And since Q ≤ 30,000, we have Q in [20,000, 30,000].

But perhaps for each Q in that range, we can find the number of triples (a, b, c) with a + b + c = 300, ab + bc + ca = Q, and abc = P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

But that seems a bit abstract. Maybe it's better to consider symmetric cases where two variables are equal, or perhaps all three are equal, and see if that gives us any solutions.

Wait, let's consider the case where all three variables are equal. Then a = b = c = 100.

Then, let's check the second condition:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Each term is 100² * 100 = 100³ = 1,000,000. There are 6 terms, so total is 6,000,000. Which matches the given condition. So (100,100,100) is a solution. But how many distinct triples is that? Since all are equal, so only one triple.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, it's triples of nonnegative integers, so order matters. So, if a, b, c are all 100, that's only one triple. But maybe there are other triples where a, b, c are not all equal that satisfy the conditions.

Wait, let's check another case where two variables are equal, say a = b, and c is different.

Let me suppose that a = b. Then, since a + b + c = 300, we have 2a + c = 300, so c = 300 - 2a.

Then, let's compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Since a = b, this becomes:

a³ + a²c + a³ + a²c + c²a + c²a + c²a + c²a.

Wait, no, let's compute each term:

a²b = a²a = a³

a²c = a²c

b²a = a²a = a³

b²c = a²c

c²a = c²a

c²b = c²a

So, the terms are:

a³ + a²c + a³ + a²c + c²a + c²a.

Adding up:

2a³ + 2a²c + 2c²a.

Factor out 2a:

2a(a² + a c + c²).

But let's see, with a = b and c = 300 - 2a, let's substitute:

2a [ a² + a (300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2 ].

Simplify inside the brackets:

a² + 300a - 2a² + (90000 - 1200a + 4a²)

= a² - 2a² + 4a² + 300a -1200a + 90000

= (1 -2 +4)a² + (300 -1200)a + 90000

= 3a² -900a +90000.

So the entire expression becomes:

2a * (3a² -900a +90000) = 6a³ -1800a² + 180000a.

And this should equal 6,000,000.

So,

6a³ -1800a² + 180000a -6,000,000 = 0.

Divide both sides by 6:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a -1,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, let's try to find integer roots for this equation. Maybe we can factor it.

Let me try a = 100:

100³ -300*(100)^2 +30,000*100 -1,000,000

= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 +3,000,000 -1,000,000 = 0.

So, a=100 is a root. Therefore, we can factor (a - 100) from the cubic.

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide a³ -300a² +30,000a -1,000,000 by (a - 100).

Using synthetic division:

100 | 1   -300    30000    -1000000

          100     -20000      1000000

      1    -200     10000          0

So, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a² -200a +10,000).

Now, set each factor equal to zero:

a = 100, or a² -200a +10,000 = 0.

Solving the quadratic:

a = [200 ± sqrt(40,000 -40,000)] / 2 = [200 ± 0]/2 = 100.

So, the only root is a=100, a double root. So, the equation becomes (a -100)^2 (a -100) = (a -100)^3 =0.

Wait, no, the quadratic had a repeated root at a=100, so the cubic is (a -100)^3 = 0. So, the only solution is a=100.

Thus, when a=b=100, c=300 - 200 =100. So, in this case, all three variables are 100, which is the case we already considered. So, that's the only solution when a = b.

Hmm, perhaps another case where two variables are equal, but a ≠ b ≠ c. Wait, but in the case where two are equal, we only get the all-equal solution. So maybe the only solution is when all three are equal.

Wait, but that seems too restrictive. Maybe I should try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let variables be arranged in some order and consider some substitutions.

Wait, the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000 can be written as P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

But since P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ca.

So, for given a, b, c, we have these values. But how can we find possible (a, b, c) triples?

Another thought: perhaps express the equation in terms of symmetric sums. Let me consider that.

We have S = a + b + c =300.

Q = ab + bc + ca.

P = abc.

So, our equation is 100Q - P = 2,000,000.

Which gives us P =100 Q -2,000,000.

But we can also use the relation that for a cubic equation, the product is P, and the sum is S, and the sum of products is Q.

But perhaps there's another way. Let's consider that for nonnegative integers a, b, c, with a + b + c =300, and 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me rearrange this equation:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) -2,000,000.

Wait, perhaps factor 100:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2*10^6.

Hmm, maybe we can factor this as:

abc + 2*10^6 = 100(ab + bc + ca).

Alternatively, perhaps we can divide both sides by abc, but that might not be helpful since some variables could be zero.

Wait, but if any of a, b, c is zero, then abc=0. Let's see what happens in that case.

Case 1: Suppose c=0. Then, a + b =300, and the second equation becomes:

a²b + a²*0 + b²a + b²*0 + 0²a +0²b = a²b + b²a = ab(a + b) = ab*300.

Set equal to 6,000,000:

ab *300 =6,000,000 ⇒ ab = 6,000,000 /300 =20,000.

So, ab=20,000 and a + b=300.

We can solve for a and b: Let a and b be roots of x² -300x +20,000=0.

Compute discriminant D = 90,000 -80,000=10,000.

So sqrt(D)=100.

Thus, a=(300±100)/2 ⇒ a=200 or a=100.

So, the solutions when c=0 are (200,100,0), (100,200,0), (200,0,100), etc., considering all permutations.

Wait, but wait. If c=0, then the solutions for a and b are (200,100,0), (100,200,0), etc. So, how many distinct triples does this give?

Each permutation of (200,100,0) is a distinct triple, but since two of them are non-zero, the number of triples would be the number of permutations of these three numbers, considering that two are distinct and one is zero.

Wait, in this case, the non-zero numbers are 200 and 100, and zero. So, the number of distinct triples is 3! =6, since all are distinct. Wait, but 200, 100, and 0 are all distinct, so yes, each permutation is unique.

But wait, no, because a, b, c are ordered triples, so each ordering is unique. So, for c=0, the number of ordered triples would be the number of ways to arrange 200, 100, 0 in a, b, c, which is 3! =6.

But wait, but in our case, when c=0, the equation becomes ab*300=6,000,000, which gives ab=20,000. So, when a=200, b=100, and vice versa. So, each of these gives a distinct triple when combined with c=0. So, for c=0, we get 2 ordered triples, but wait, when a=200, b=100, c=0, and a=100, b=200, c=0, and also a=0, b=200, c=100, etc. Wait, wait, no: when c=0, a and b can be 200 and 100 in any order, so that's two possibilities. But also, when a=0, then we have b + c=300, and the equation becomes a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b =0 +0 +0 + b²c + c²*0 + c²b = b²c + c²b = bc(b + c) = bc*300. So, if a=0, then similar to when c=0, we have bc*300=6,000,000 ⇒ bc=20,000. So, b and c would be 200 and 100, so the triples would include (0,200,100), (0,100,200), etc.

Similarly, if b=0, then a + c=300, and the equation becomes a²*0 + a²c + 0 + 0 + c²a + c²*0 = a²c + c²a = ac(a + c)=ac*300=6,000,000 ⇒ ac=20,000. So, a and c would be 200 and 100, giving triples like (200,0,100), (100,0,200), etc.

So, in total, when one variable is zero, we get 2 solutions for each zero variable, but considering all three variables can be zero, but in each case, the other two must sum to 300 and have a product of 20,000.

Wait, but in our case, when a variable is zero, the other two are 200 and 100, so for each zero variable, there are two ordered triples (since the other two can be in any order). So, for each of the three variables being zero, we get two ordered triples, so 3 * 2 =6 ordered triples where one variable is zero.

Wait, but each of these is unique. So, these are 6 distinct ordered triples where one variable is zero, and the other two are 200 and 100.

So, that's 6 solutions so far.

But wait, earlier when I considered a=b=c=100, that's another solution, with all variables positive, no zeros. So, that's one more solution.

Wait, but are there other solutions where none of a, b, c are zero?

Alternatively, perhaps all variables are positive integers. Let me see if that's possible.

So, let's assume that a, b, c are all positive integers. Then, from the equation 100Q - P =2,000,000, with Q =ab + bc + ca and P=abc.

Wait, but we also have S = a + b + c=300.

I can try to see if there are any other solutions besides the all-100s case and the cases where one variable is zero.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose that a=150, b=150, c=0. Then, a + b + c=300, and the second equation becomes a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b =150²*150 +0 +150²*150 +0 +0 +0=2*(150^3)=2*(3,375,000)=6,750,000, which is more than 6,000,000. So, that's too big. Hmm, but when a=200, b=100, c=0, the sum is 200²*100 + 200²*0 +100²*200 +100²*0 +0 +0= 40,000*100 +10,000*200=4,000,000 +2,000,000=6,000,000. So that's correct.

Wait, so if I take a=150, b=150, c=0, the sum is 6,750,000, which is more than 6,000,000. So, that's a higher value.

What about a=120, b=120, c=60.

Let me check a + b + c=120+120+60=300.

Now, compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

=120²*120 +120²*60 +120²*120 +120²*60 +60²*120 +60²*120.

Compute each term:

120^3 +120^2*60 +120^3 +120^2*60 +60^3 +60^2*120.

= 2*(120^3) + 2*(120^2 *60) + 60^3 +60^2*120.

Hmm, that's a bit tedious, but let me compute:

120^3 = 1,728,000.

120^2=14,400, so 14,400*60=864,000.

60^3=216,000.

60^2=3,600, so 3,600*120=432,000.

So, substituting:

2*(1,728,000) =3,456,000.

2*(864,000)=1,728,000.

Plus 216,000 and 432,000.

Total is 3,456,000 +1,728,000=5,184,000; then 5,184,000 +216,000=5,400,000; then 5,400,000 +432,000=5,832,000.

Which is less than 6,000,000. So, this triple doesn't satisfy the condition.

Hmm, perhaps there are other triples where two variables are equal and the third is different, but not zero.

Wait, earlier when I considered a = b, I found that the only solution was when a = b = c =100. So, perhaps that's the only case where all variables are positive.

Alternatively, maybe I should try to find other triples where all three are positive.

Wait, let's suppose that a, b, c are all positive integers, and let me consider the equation 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc =2,000,000.

I can rearrange this as abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.

Alternatively, abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) -2,000,000.

Wait, perhaps I can write this as:

abc + 2,000,000 = 100(ab + bc + ca).

Hmm, perhaps factor this differently.

Alternatively, let me think in terms of variables. Let me set x = a, y = b, z = c.

So, x + y + z =300.

And 100(xy + yz + zx) - xyz =2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can try to express this equation as:

xyz =100(xy + yz + zx) -2,000,000.

Hmm, it's not obvious. Maybe I can consider substituting one variable in terms of the others.

For example, z =300 - x - y.

Then, substitute into the equation:

100(xy + y(300 -x -y) +x(300 -x -y)) - x y (300 -x -y) =2,000,000.

This seems complicated, but let's try to expand it.

First, compute Q = xy + yz + zx.

z =300 -x -y.

So,

Q = xy + y(300 -x -y) + x(300 -x -y)

= xy + 300y -xy -y² +300x -x² -xy.

Simplify:

= 300y - y² +300x -x² -xy.

So,

Q = -x² -y² -xy +300x +300y.

Then, 100Q = -100x² -100y² -100xy +30,000x +30,000y.

Now, P = xyz =x y (300 -x -y).

So, the equation is:

100Q - P =2,000,000.

Which is:

(-100x² -100y² -100xy +30,000x +30,000y) - (x y (300 -x -y)) =2,000,000.

Hmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can expand and simplify.

Expanding:

-100x² -100y² -100xy +30,000x +30,000y -300xy +x² y +x y² =2,000,000.

Now, let's collect like terms.

Quadratic terms:

-100x² -100y².

Linear terms: +30,000x +30,000y.

Cross terms: (-100xy -300xy) = -400xy.

Cubic terms: +x² y +x y².

So, putting it all together:

-100x² -100y² -400xy +30,000x +30,000y +x² y +x y² =2,000,000.

Hmm, this equation is quite complex. Maybe it's better to think of specific cases or find symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps let's assume that a ≤ b ≤ c, and try to find possible values.

Wait, but since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps we can assume WLOG that a ≤ b ≤ c, and then count the number of such triples and multiply by the number of permutations.

But given that a, b, c can be zero, it's a bit more involved.

Wait, earlier, we found that when one variable is zero, there are 6 ordered triples. And when all variables are 100, that's another triple, but it's just one ordered triple because all are equal.

Wait, but wait, in the case where all are 100, it's just one triple, but when two are equal and the third is different, like a= b=100, c=100, which is the same as all equal. So, perhaps the only solutions are the 6 triples where one variable is zero and the other two are 200 and 100, and the one triple where all are 100.

Wait, but earlier when I considered a= b=100, c=100, that's the only solution in that case.

Wait, but let me check another case where a, b, c are all positive and different.

Suppose a=150, b=100, c=50.

Check a + b + c=300.

Compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

=150²*100 +150²*50 +100²*150 +100²*50 +50²*150 +50²*100.

Compute each term:

150²=22,500.

22,500 *100=2,250,000.

22,500*50=1,125,000.

100²=10,000.

10,000*150=1,500,000.

10,000*50=500,000.

50²=2,500.

2,500*150=375,000.

2,500*100=250,000.

Adding them up:

2,250,000 +1,125,000 =3,375,000.

3,375,000 +1,500,000=4,875,000.

4,875,000 +500,000=5,375,000.

5,375,000 +375,000=5,750,000.

5,750,000 +250,000=6,000,000.

Oh! So this triple (150,100,50) satisfies both equations. So, that's another solution where all variables are positive and distinct.

Hmm, so that's a new solution. So, that suggests that there are more solutions beyond the ones I initially considered.

So, that's a problem because earlier I thought that the only solutions were when one variable is zero and the others are 200 and 100, and when all are 100.

So, perhaps I need to find all such triples where a, b, c are positive integers, possibly distinct, such that a + b + c=300 and 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc=2,000,000.

So, let's try to find more such triples.

Wait, in the case where a=150, b=100, c=50, we saw that it works. Let me see if there are similar solutions.

Perhaps we can find more solutions where a, b, c are in some ratio.

Wait, let me try to find other solutions by trial and error.

Let me try a=120, b=120, c=60.

Wait, I think I tried that earlier, and it didn't work. Let me check again.

Wait, a=120, b=120, c=60.

Compute the sum: 120 +120 +60=300.

Compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

=120²*120 +120²*60 +120²*120 +120²*60 +60²*120 +60²*120.

=120^3 +120^2*60 +120^3 +120^2*60 +60^3 +60^2*120.

As before, this is 2*120^3 + 2*120^2*60 +60^3 +60^2*120.

Calculating each term:

120^3=1,728,000.

120^2=14,400; 14,400*60=864,000.

60^3=216,000.

60^2=3,600; 3,600*120=432,000.

So,

2*1,728,000=3,456,000.

2*864,000=1,728,000.

Adding: 3,456,000 +1,728,000=5,184,000.

Plus 216,000 gives 5,400,000.

Plus 432,000 gives 5,832,000, which is less than 6,000,000.

So, that doesn't work.

Hmm, let me try another set. How about a=180, b=90, c=30.

Check a + b + c=180+90+30=300.

Compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

=180²*90 +180²*30 +90²*180 +90²*30 +30²*180 +30²*90.

Compute each term:

180²=32,400.

32,400*90=2,916,000.

32,400*30=972,000.

90²=8,100.

8,100*180=1,458,000.

8,100*30=243,000.

30²=900.

900*180=162,000.

900*90=81,000.

Now, sum all terms:

2,916,000 +972,000=3,888,000.

+1,458,000=5,346,000.

+243,000=5,589,000.

+162,000=5,751,000.

+81,000=5,832,000.

Which again is less than 6,000,000.

Hmm, so that doesn't work either.

Wait, let's try a=200, b=100, c=0. That works, as we saw earlier.

Wait, another approach: perhaps use the fact that when a=150, b=100, c=50, it works. Maybe there's a pattern where a=150, b=100, c=50, and permutations.

Wait, but let's check another case. Let me try a=200, b=100, c=0: that's one solution.

What about a=150, b=150, c=0? Let's see:

a + b + c=150+150+0=300.

Compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

=150²*150 +150²*0 +150²*150 +150²*0 +0 +0.

=2*(150^3)=2*(3,375,000)=6,750,000, which is more than 6,000,000. So, that's too big.

Hmm.

Alternatively, let's consider that when a=150, b=100, c=50, the equation holds. So, what's special about this triple?

Wait, let's compute Q and P for this triple.

Q=ab + bc + ca=150*100 +100*50 +50*150=15,000 +5,000 +7,500=27,500.

P=abc=150*100*50=750,000.

Then, 100Q - P=100*27,500 -750,000=2,750,000 -750,000=2,000,000, which matches.

So, that works.

Similarly, let's see if there are other triples where Q=27,500 and P=750,000.

Wait, but how can we find all such triples?

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that for a given Q, there might be multiple triples (a, b, c) leading to the same Q and P.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can consider substituting variables.

Let me set variables as a, b, c, with a ≤ b ≤ c.

Wait, but then again, the problem is symmetric, so maybe it's better to think in terms of possible abc and Q.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the equation 100Q - P =2,000,000 as P =100Q -2,000,000.

So, for given a, b, c, with a + b + c=300, we can compute Q and P.

But without more constraints, it's difficult to proceed.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that Q must be an integer, and P must be a positive integer as well, since a, b, c are nonnegative.

Wait, but in the case where a=150, b=100, c=50, we have Q=27,500 and P=750,000.

So, let's see if there are other triples with the same Q and P.

Wait, perhaps if we permutate the values of a, b, c, we can get more solutions.

For example, a=150, b=50, c=100: same numbers, just reordered.

Similarly, a=100, b=150, c=50, etc.

So, for each such triple where a, b, c are all positive and distinct, there are 6 permutations, unless some variables are equal.

Wait, but in the case where a=150, b=100, c=50, all are distinct, so there are 6 ordered triples.

Similarly, for the case where one variable is zero, like (200,100,0), there are 6 ordered triples as well.

Plus the case where a=b=c=100, which is just one ordered triple.

So, that's 6 (from zero case) +6 (from 150,100,50 case) +1=13.

Wait, but wait, earlier I found that a=150, b=100, c=50 works, but are there other such triples?

Let me try another one. Let's try a=200, b=100, c=0: works.

What about a=120, b=130, c=50: sum is 300.

Compute Q=120*130 +130*50 +50*120=15,600 +6,500 +6,000=28,100.

P=120*130*50=780,000.

Then, 100*28,100 -780,000=2,810,000 -780,000=2,030,000, which is more than 2,000,000. So, that's too big.

Hmm, perhaps try a=140, b=110, c=50.

Sum=140+110+50=300.

Compute Q=140*110 +110*50 +50*140=15,400 +5,500 +7,000=27,900.

P=140*110*50=770,000.

Then, 100*27,900 -770,000=2,790,000 -770,000=2,020,000, which is more than 2,000,000.

Hmm, still too big.

Wait, let's try a=160, b=80, c=60.

Sum=160+80+60=300.

Compute Q=160*80 +80*60 +60*160=12,800 +4,800 +9,600=27,200.

P=160*80*60=768,000.

Then, 100*27,200 -768,000=2,720,000 -768,000=1,952,000, which is less than 2,000,000.

Hmm, not enough.

Wait, let's try a=140, b=120, c=40.

Sum=140 +120 +40=300.

Compute Q=140*120 +120*40 +40*140=16,800 +4,800 +5,600=27,200.

P=140*120*40=672,000.

Then, 100*27,200=2,720,000 -672,000=2,048,000. Hmm, that's more than 2,000,000.

Wait, perhaps I can adjust the numbers to get closer.

Wait, when a=150, b=100, c=50, we have Q=27,500 and P=750,000, which gives exactly 2,000,000.

What about a=160, b=80, c=60: Q=27,200, P=768,000 → 100Q - P=2,720,000-768,000=1,952,000.

Hmm, so less than 2,000,000.

Wait, perhaps I can find another triple where Q=27,500 and P=750,000.

Wait, for that, we can think of a system where ab + bc + ca=27,500 and abc=750,000, with a + b + c=300.

But that seems non-trivial.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set up the equations.

We have a + b + c=300.

ab + bc + ca=27,500.

abc=750,000.

So, we can think of a, b, c as roots of the cubic equation x³ -300x² +27,500x -750,000=0.

Let me try to factor this.

Trying rational roots using Rational Root Theorem: possible roots are factors of 750,000 divided by factors of 1.

So, possible roots include 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 750,000. That's a lot, but perhaps we can try small integers.

Wait, let's try x=50:

50³ -300*50² +27,500*50 -750,000.

=125,000 -750,000 +1,375,000 -750,000.

= (125,000 -750,000) + (1,375,000 -750,000) = (-625,000) +625,000=0.

So, x=50 is a root.

Thus, we can factor (x -50) from the cubic.

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide x³ -300x² +27,500x -750,000 by (x -50).

Using synthetic division with x=50:

50 | 1   -300    27500      -750000

          50      -12500        750000

      1    -250     15000           0

So, the cubic factors as (x -50)(x² -250x +15,000).

Now, solve x² -250x +15,000=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [250 ± sqrt(62,500 -60,000)] / 2

= [250 ± sqrt(2,500)] /2

= [250 ±50]/2.

So, x= (250+50)/2=300/2=150, and x=(250-50)/2=200/2=100.

Thus, the roots are x=50, 100, 150.

So, the triple (a,b,c)=(50,100,150) is a solution. Since the variables are symmetric, any permutation of these numbers is also a solution.

So, the number of ordered triples for this case is the number of permutations of 50,100,150. Since all three are distinct, there are 3! =6 ordered triples.

So, now we have:

- 6 ordered triples where one variable is zero and the others are 200 and 100.

- 1 ordered triple where all variables are 100.

- 6 ordered triples where the variables are 50,100,150 in some order.

So, total so far is 6 +6 +1=13.

Wait, but wait, earlier when I considered a=150, b=100, c=50, I only found one case, but now I see that there are 6 permutations for this, and similar for the zero case.

So, 6 (zero case) +6 (150,100,50 case) +1 (all 100s) =13.

But wait, is that all? Or are there more solutions?

Wait, let me check another possible triple. Suppose a=100, b=100, c=100: that's the all-equal case, which we've already counted.

Another case: a=200, b=100, c=0: already counted.

What about a=150, b=150, c=0: as I tried earlier, that gives a second equation value of 6,750,000, which is too big, so it's not a solution.

Similarly, a=120, b=120, c=60: as before, sum is 300, but the second equation gives 5,832,000, which is less than 6,000,000.

Hmm, so perhaps the only solutions are the ones we've found so far: the zero case, the all-100s case, and the 50,100,150 case.

Wait, but let me try a=200, b=50, c=50.

Check a + b + c=200+50+50=300.

Compute the second equation:

a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b.

=200²*50 +200²*50 +50²*200 +50²*50 +50²*200 +50²*50.

Compute each term:

200²=40,000.

40,000*50=2,000,000.

So, 200²*50 occurs twice: 2*2,000,000=4,000,000.

50²=2,500.

2,500*200=500,000.

That occurs twice: 2*500,000=1,000,000.

2,500*50=125,000, which occurs twice: 2*125,000=250,000.

So, adding all up:

4,000,000 +1,000,000=5,000,000.

+250,000=5,250,000.

Which is more than 6,000,000? No, wait, 5,250,000 is less than 6,000,000.

Hmm, so that doesn't work.

Wait, another approach: perhaps consider that in the case where two variables are equal and the third is different, but not zero, does that lead to any solutions?

Earlier, when I set a = b, I found that the only solution was a = b = c =100.

Thus, the only such solution is when all are equal.

So, perhaps the only solutions are the ones we found: the zero case, the all-100s case, and the 50,100,150 case.

Thus, the total number of ordered triples would be:

- 6 (zero case)

- 6 (50,100,150 case)

- 1 (all 100s)

Total of 13.

Wait, but let me confirm that there are no other cases where all variables are positive and distinct beyond 50,100,150.

Wait, let's suppose that a, b, c are all positive and distinct, and different from 50,100,150.

Suppose a=100, b=120, c=80.

Sum=100+120+80=300.

Compute Q=100*120 +120*80 +80*100=12,000 +9,600 +8,000=29,600.

P=100*120*80=960,000.

Then, 100Q - P=2,960,000 -960,000=2,000,000. Oh! That works.

Wait, so this is another solution: (100,120,80).

Wait, let me check the second equation.

Compute a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b.

=100²*120 +100²*80 +120²*100 +120²*80 +80²*100 +80²*120.

Compute each term:

100²=10,000.

10,000*120=1,200,000.

10,000*80=800,000.

120²=14,400.

14,400*100=1,440,000.

14,400*80=1,152,000.

80²=6,400.

6,400*100=640,000.

6,400*120=768,000.

Adding them up:

1,200,000 +800,000=2,000,000.

+1,440,000=3,440,000.

+1,152,000=4,592,000.

+640,000=5,232,000.

+768,000=6,000,000.

Yes, that works.

So, that's another triple where all variables are positive and distinct: (100,120,80).

Wait, so that suggests that there are more solutions beyond the cases we initially considered.

Hmm, this complicates things. So, perhaps there are multiple triples where all variables are positive and distinct.

Wait, so how can we find all such solutions?

Hmm, perhaps we can find that when Q=29,600, P=960,000, we have another solution.

Let me see if that's the case.

So, for a=100, b=120, c=80:

Q=ab + bc + ca=100*120 +120*80 +80*100=12,000 +9,600 +8,000=29,600.

P=abc=100*120*80=960,000.

Thus, 100Q - P=2,960,000 -960,000=2,000,000.

So, that works.

Similarly, let's try another set. Let's try a=110, b=110, c=80.

Sum=110+110+80=300.

Compute Q=110*110 +110*80 +80*110=12,100 +8,800 +8,800=29,700.

P=110*110*80=968,000.

Then, 100*29,700 -968,000=2,970,000 -968,000=2,002,000, which is more than 2,000,000.

Hmm, close but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I can find another solution by trial.

Let me try a=130, b=90, c=80.

Sum=130+90+80=300.

Compute Q=130*90 +90*80 +80*130=11,700 +7,200 +10,400=29,300.

P=130*90*80=936,000.

Then, 100*29,300=2,930,000 -936,000=1,994,000, which is less than 2,000,000.

Hmm, so that's not quite.

Wait, another approach: since we have two different triples that satisfy the conditions, perhaps there are multiple such triples.

So, perhaps the number of solutions is higher than 13.

Wait, but how can we systematically find all possible solutions?

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a system of equations.

We have:

1. a + b + c = 300.

2. 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc =2,000,000.

Let me rearrange equation 2 as:

abc =100(ab + bc + ca) -2,000,000.

Let me denote x=a, y=b, z=c.

So,

xyz =100(xy + yz + zx) -2,000,000.

We can think of this as:

xyz -100xy -100yz -100zx = -2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps factor this expression.

Alternatively, add 100^3 to both sides:

xyz -100xy -100yz -100zx +100^3 = -2,000,000 +100^3.

But 100^3=1,000,000, so RHS becomes -2,000,000 +1,000,000= -1,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps we can factor the left side.

Notice that:

xyz -100xy -100yz -100zx +100^3 = (x -100)(y -100)(z -100).

Let me check:

(x -100)(y -100)(z -100) = xyz -100xy -100xz -100yz +100^2x +100^2y +100^2z -100^3.

Hmm, that's not matching exactly. Let me compute it properly.

Wait, expanding (x -100)(y -100)(z -100):

First, multiply (x -100)(y -100) = xy -100x -100y +10000.

Then, multiply by (z -100):

= (xy -100x -100y +10000)(z -100)

= xy*z -100x*z -100y*z +10000*z -100xy +10000x +10000y -1000000.

Wait, that's:

= xyz -100xz -100yz +10,000z -100xy +10,000x +10,000y -1,000,000.

Hmm, that's not the same as xyz -100xy -100yz -100zx.

So, perhaps this approach isn't directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the equation as:

(x -100)(y -100)(z -100) = something.

Wait, let's see:

We have:

xyz -100xy -100yz -100zx = -2,000,000.

Add 100^3 to both sides:

xyz -100xy -100yz -100zx +100^3 = -2,000,000 +1,000,000 = -1,000,000.

Hmm, as before.

But the expansion of (x-100)(y-100)(z-100) is:

xyz -100xy -100xz -100yz +10000x +10000y +10000z -1,000,000.

Which is similar but has extra terms.

So, perhaps we can write:

(x-100)(y-100)(z-100) = xyz -100xy -100xz -100yz +10,000x +10,000y +10,000z -1,000,000.

We have xyz -100xy -100yz -100zx = -2,000,000.

So, comparing:

xyz -100xy -100yz -100zx = -2,000,000.

So,

(x-100)(y-100)(z-100) = (xyz -100xy -100xz -100yz) +10,000x +10,000y +10,000z -1,000,000.

= (-2,000,000) +10,000x +10,000y +10,000z -1,000,000.

= -3,000,000 +10,000(x + y + z).

But from equation 1, x + y + z =300.

So,

= -3,000,000 +10,000*300 = -3,000,000 +3,000,000=0.

Thus,

(x-100)(y-100)(z-100)=0.

Wait, that's a significant simplification!

So, (x-100)(y-100)(z-100)=0.

Which implies that at least one of the variables x, y, z must be equal to 100.

So, this is a crucial insight.

Thus, either a=100, b=100, or c=100.

Therefore, every solution must have at least one variable equal to 100.

So, this greatly reduces the problem.

So, let's consider cases based on which variable is 100.

Case 1: a=100.

Then, the equation becomes:

100 + b + c =300 ⇒ b + c=200.

The second equation:

100Q - P =2,000,000, where Q=ab + bc + ca, P=abc.

With a=100, Q=100b + bc +100c=100(b + c) + bc=100*200 + bc=20,000 + bc.

P=100*b*c.

So, substituting into 100Q - P=2,000,000:

100*(20,000 + bc) -100*b*c=2,000,000.

Simplify:

2,000,000 +100 bc -100 bc=2,000,000.

Which simplifies to 2,000,000=2,000,000.

Which is always true.

Wait, that's interesting. So, whenever a=100, and b + c=200, the second equation is automatically satisfied, regardless of the values of b and c.

So, in this case, for a=100, b and c can be any nonnegative integers such that b + c=200.

Thus, the number of such triples is the number of ordered pairs (b, c) where b + c=200.

Which is 201 solutions (from b=0 to b=200, c=200 -b).

But wait, in our earlier consideration, when a=100, and b + c=200, any such pair would satisfy the second equation.

But wait, wait a second. When a=100, b and c can be any nonnegative integers summing to 200, so the number of ordered pairs is 201.

But wait, in our earlier cases, we found specific solutions like (100,120,80), but according to this, any (100, b, 200 -b) would work.

Wait, but that can't be right because earlier when I tried a=100, b=120, c=80, it worked, but if I take a=100, b=1, c=199, would that also work?

Let me check:

a=100, b=1, c=199.

Sum=100+1+199=300.

Compute the second equation:

a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b.

=100²*1 +100²*199 +1²*100 +1²*199 +199²*100 +199²*1.

Compute each term:

100²=10,000.

10,000*1=10,000.

10,000*199=1,990,000.

1²=1.

1*100=100.

1*199=199.

199²=39,601.

39,601*100=3,960,100.

39,601*1=39,601.

Now, sum all terms:

10,000 +1,990,000=2,000,000.

+100=2,000,100.

+199=2,000,299.

+3,960,100=5,960,399.

+39,601=6,000,000.

Yes! It works.

So, indeed, any triple where a=100 and b + c=200 will satisfy both conditions.

Similarly, if b=100, then a + c=200, and any such (a, c) would work.

Same if c=100, then a + b=200.

So, in total, the number of ordered triples is as follows:

- For a=100: 201 ordered triples (since b can be from 0 to 200, and c=200 -b).

- For b=100: Similarly, 201 ordered triples, but we've already counted the cases where a=100 and b=100, so we need to avoid double-counting.

Wait, no, because when a=100, b can vary, and when b=100, a can vary. The overlap occurs when both a=100 and b=100, which forces c=100 as well.

Similarly, when c=100, a + b=200, which includes cases where a=100 and b=100, etc.

So, to compute the total number of ordered triples where at least one variable is 100, we can use inclusion-exclusion.

Total = Number with a=100 + Number with b=100 + Number with c=100 - Number with a=100 and b=100 - Number with a=100 and c=100 - Number with b=100 and c=100 + Number with a=100 and b=100 and c=100.

But since in our case, when two variables are 100, the third must be 100 as well (since a + b + c=300). So, the only triple where two variables are 100 is when all three are 100.

So, let's compute:

Number with a=100: 201 (since b + c=200, ordered pairs).

Similarly, Number with b=100: 201.

Number with c=100: 201.

Now, the intersections:

Number with a=100 and b=100: Only possible when c=100, so 1 triple.

Similarly, a=100 and c=100: Only when b=100, so 1 triple.

b=100 and c=100: Only when a=100, so 1 triple.

Finally, Number with a=100 and b=100 and c=100: 1 triple.

So, applying inclusion-exclusion:

Total = 201 +201 +201 -1 -1 -1 +1.

= (201*3) -3 +1.

= 603 -3 +1=601.

Wait, that can't be right because when a=100, the number of triples is 201, but when b=100, some of those are already counted when a=100.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that for each variable being 100, the number of triples is 201, but subtract the overlaps where two variables are 100, which is 1 triple each, and then add back the triple where all three are 100.

Wait, but let's think more carefully.

When a=100, the number of triples is 201, which includes all cases where a=100, regardless of b and c.

Similarly, when b=100, the number of triples is 201, which includes cases where a=100 or c=100.

But when we add the three cases (a=100, b=100, c=100), we are overcounting the overlaps.

So, the correct formula is:

Total = (Number with a=100) + (Number with b=100) + (Number with c=100) - 2*(Number with a=100 and b=100) - 2*(Number with a=100 and c=100) - 2*(Number with b=100 and c=100) + 3*(Number with a=100 and b=100 and c=100).

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it as:

Each of the three cases (a=100, b=100, c=100) has 201 triples.

But when two variables are 100, the third is forced to be 100, so each intersection of two variables being 100 has 1 triple.

And the intersection of all three being 100 is 1 triple.

So, using inclusion-exclusion:

Total = 3*201 - 3*1 +1.

Wait, because each pair like a=100 and b=100 is counted twice in the initial 3*201, so we subtract them once each, and then add back the triple intersection once.

So,

Total =3*201 -3*1 +1=603 -3 +1=601.

But that gives 601, which seems high. But let's see: for a=100, 201 triples; same for b=100 and c=100.

But when a=100 and b=100, that's the triple (100,100,100), which is counted once in each of a=100, b=100, and c=100.

Similarly, when a=100 and c=100, that's also (100,100,100).

So, the overlaps are all the same triple.

Thus, the correct inclusion-exclusion would be:

Total = (201 +201 +201) - 3*(1) +1.

Wait, because each pair like a=100 and b=100 contributes 1 triple, and there are three such pairs. But in inclusion-exclusion, when you subtract the pairwise intersections, you subtract each once. Then, you add back the triple intersection once.

So,

Total = 3*201 -3*1 +1=603 -3 +1=601.

Hmm, but let's check if this is accurate.

Each of the 201 triples where a=100 includes the case where b=100 (and c=100), which is the triple (100,100,100). Similarly for the other cases.

So, when we sum the three 201s, we have counted (100,100,100) three times.

Then, when we subtract the three pairwise intersections (each being 1 triple), we subtract it three times, bringing the count to zero.

But we need to count it once, so we add it back once.

Thus, the total is 3*201 -3*1 +1=601.

But wait, when a=100, the number of triples is 201, which includes all (100, b, c) where b + c=200. Similarly for b=100 and c=100.

But when we add all three, we have to consider that the triple (100,100,100) is included in all three, so the inclusion-exclusion applies as above.

So, the total number of ordered triples where at least one variable is 100 is 601.

But wait, 3*201=603. Then, subtract 3 for the overlaps, getting 600, then add 1 for the triple overlap, getting 601.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the total number of ordered triples is 601.

But wait, earlier, we found specific cases like (150,100,50) and permutations, but according to this, any triple where at least one variable is 100 satisfies the conditions.

Wait, but that contradicts the earlier finding where (150,100,50) also worked, but that triple doesn't have any variable equal to 100. Wait, no, (150,100,50) does have 100 as one of the variables.

Wait, yes, in that case, b=100, so it's included in the count.

Similarly, the triple (100,120,80) has a=100, so it's included.

So, all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100, which explains why the earlier approach via (x-100)(y-100)(z-100)=0 worked.

Therefore, the only solutions are those where at least one variable is 100, and the other two sum to 200.

Thus, the number of such ordered triples is 601.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that when a=100, the number of triples is 201, which includes all possible (b,c) such that b + c=200, including cases where b=0 or c=0.

So, the 601 includes all these cases.

So, the final answer is 601.

Wait, but earlier, when I considered specific cases, I thought there were only 13 solutions, but that was because I was only considering some specific triples. But according to this, any triple where at least one variable is 100 will work, leading to 601 solutions.

Thus, the number of ordered triples is 601.


The number of ordered triples is determined by considering that at least one variable must be 100, leading to 601 valid solutions.

The final answer is \boxed{601}.
