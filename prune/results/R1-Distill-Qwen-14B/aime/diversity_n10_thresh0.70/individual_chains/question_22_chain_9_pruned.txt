Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. All the opposite sides are parallel, which is an interesting condition. The problem mentions that when you extend the sides AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, first, let me visualize what this hexagon looks like. Since it's convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it must be similar to a regular hexagon but possibly stretched or skewed in some way. But wait, in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal, and all opposite sides are parallel, so maybe this hexagon is a scaled version or something similar.

The key part is that when you extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. That triangle has sides 200, 240, and 300. I'm thinking maybe I can use similar triangles or some proportionality here.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since all sides are equal, each side AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA is length 's'.

Now, let's think about the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me denote the triangle as triangle XYZ, with sides opposite to X, Y, Z being 200, 240, 300 respectively.

Wait, but which sides correspond to which lengths? Maybe I should assign the lengths based on which sides are extended. Let's say that AB is extended to form one side of the triangle, CD another, and EF the third.

But since all opposite sides are parallel, the extensions of AB, CD, and EF should also be parallel in some way, but since they form a triangle, they must intersect each other.

Hmm, perhaps the triangle is formed by the intersection points of these extended sides. So, extending AB, CD, and EF until they meet each other, forming a larger triangle outside the hexagon.

Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it's similar to a regular hexagon but maybe scaled. But the triangle formed by extending opposite sides is a larger triangle.

I recall that in such cases, the sides of the triangle are proportional to the sides of the hexagon. Maybe I can use similar triangles or the concept of similar figures here.

Wait, another idea: in a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the extensions of every other side meet at a point, forming a triangle. So, for example, AB and CD are opposite, so their extensions meet at a point, and similarly, CD and EF meet at another, and EF and AB at the third.

Wait, no, perhaps each pair of opposite sides, when extended, meet at a point, forming a triangle. So, AB and DE are opposite, BC and EF are opposite, CD and FA are opposite. Wait, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, the hexagon is labeled ABCDEF, so the opposite sides are AB opposite to DE, BC opposite to EF, and CD opposite to FA. Hmm, but the problem says all pairs of opposite sides are parallel.
