Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me try to parse it step by step. The hexagon is ABCDEF, and it's equilateral, which I think means all its sides are equal in length. Also, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. That makes sense; in a regular hexagon, which is both equilateral and equiangular, all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel. But this hexagon isn't necessarily regular because it's just equilateral, not necessarily equiangular.

The problem says that the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm. So, first, let me visualize this. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. Let me think about how that triangle would look. Since AB, CD, and EF are sides of the hexagon, and the hexagon is convex, these extensions would meet at some points outside the hexagon, forming a larger triangle.

Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, I think this might relate to the concept of a "truncated triangle," where each side is extended and the hexagon sits in the center. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should draw a rough sketch.

Wait, I can't draw, but I can imagine. Let me try to think in terms of similar triangles or perhaps using coordinate geometry. Maybe assigning coordinates to the hexagon's vertices and then figuring out relationships based on the given triangle.

But before jumping into coordinates, perhaps there's a more straightforward approach. Since all sides of the hexagon are equal, let's denote the side length as 's'. The triangle formed by the extensions has sides 200, 240, and 300. Let me see if this triangle is right-angled or has some special properties.

Calculating the sides: 200, 240, 300. Hmm, 200^2 + 240^2 = 40000 + 57600 = 97600. And 300^2 is 90000. Not equal, so it's not a right-angled triangle. So, maybe I can't use the Pythagorean theorem here directly.

Wait, but perhaps the ratios of the sides can help. Let's see: 200:240:300 simplifies by dividing each by 20, which gives 10:12:15. So the sides are in the ratio 10:12:15. Maybe this ratio is important.

Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, it must be a special kind of hexagon, perhaps similar to a regular hexagon but scaled in some way. Alternatively, it might be affine equivalent to a regular hexagon.

But maybe that's overcomplicating it. Let me think
