Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem, and I need to figure out the value of OC² where point C is on segment AB and doesn't lie on any other segments from the family F except AB. The points O, A, and B are given as O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. 

First, I need to understand what F looks like. Each segment PQ in F has length 1, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, if I denote P as (p, 0) and Q as (0, q), then the distance between P and Q must be 1. The distance formula gives sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, so p² + q² = 1. Since we're in the first quadrant, p and q are positive. So, all such segments PQ are from points (p,0) to (0,q) where p and q satisfy p² + q² = 1.

Wait, but the segment PQ is of unit length. So, the endpoints are (p, 0) and (0, q), and the distance between them is 1. So, that gives p² + q² = 1. So, as p varies from 0 to 1, q varies from 1 to 0, but since we're in the first quadrant, these are all in the upper right part.

Now, each of these segments PQ can be thought of as a line connecting (p, 0) to (0, q), which satisfies p² + q² = 1. So, the family F is all such possible segments for p in (0,1).

The problem says that point C is on AB, distinct from A and B, and it's the unique point that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, we need to find such a point C on AB, and then compute OC².

Hmm. So, AB is the segment connecting A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me find the equation of AB. 

The coordinates are A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB would be (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2), which simplifies to y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x is between 0 and 1/2.

Now, the key is that C doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, for all other segments PQ in F, except AB itself, C is not on PQ. So, we need to find such a point C on AB.

Alternatively, since C is on AB, we can parametrize AB. Let me parametrize AB with a parameter t, where t goes from 0 to 1. When t=0, we are at A, and t=1, we're at B. So, the coordinates would be:

x = (1/2)(1 - t) + 0*t = 1/2 (1 - t)
y = 0*(1 - t) + (sqrt(3)/2)*t = (sqrt(3)/2) t

So, C is ( (1 - t)/2 , (sqrt(3) t)/2 ). Now, we need to ensure that for any other segment PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, C must not lie on any PQ except when PQ is AB itself.

Wait, but AB is a segment from A to B. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the segment AB is part of F because the distance between A and B is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment in F.

So, we have point C on AB, not at A or B. We need to make sure that C does not lie on any other segment PQ in F.

So, our goal is to find such a point C on AB, and then compute OC².

Alternatively, perhaps C is the point on AB that is closest to O. Because if C is the closest point on AB to O, then it would only lie on AB and not on any other segments from F. Or maybe it's the point where AB is tangent to some curve related to F.

Wait, perhaps we can think of all the segments PQ in F as lines, and the envelope of all these lines might form a curve. Then, point C is the point on AB that is the only intersection point with this envelope, so it's the point where AB is tangent to this envelope.

Alternatively, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the point C is where AB is tangent to the envelope of all these segments.

Wait, another approach: For each segment PQ in F, the equation of the line PQ can be written. So, for a given p, the line PQ connects (p, 0) to (0, q), with p² + q² = 1.

The equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1.

Since p² + q² = 1, we can use that.

So, for any point (x, y), it lies on PQ if x/p + y/q = 1, with p² + q² = 1.

Our point C is (x, y) on AB, so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

If C were to lie on some other PQ besides AB, then for some p, we have x/p + y/q = 1, with p² + q² = 1, and (p, q) not equal to (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).

So, to find the point C that doesn't lie on any other PQ, we need to find (x, y) on AB such that the equation x/p + y/q = 1 has no solution except when (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).

Alternatively, for all other (p, q) with p² + q² =1, the equation x/p + y/q =1 does not hold.

Wait, but how do we characterize this? Maybe we can think of the system:

x/p + y/q = 1

p² + q² =1

We need to find (x, y) on AB such that this system has only one solution, which is when (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).

So, substituting y from AB into the equation:

x/p + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)/q = 1

But p² + q² =1.

We can write this as:

x/p + y/q =1, where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, substituting y:

x/p + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)/q =1

We can think of this as an equation in p and q, given x and y. But since we need this equation to hold only when (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2), we can set up the condition that this equation has only one solution for (p, q), which is the case when the system is such that for other (p, q) with p² + q²=1, the equation doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize p and q in terms of an angle, since p² + q²=1.

Let me consider p = cosθ and q = sinθ, since p² + q² =1. Then, the equation becomes:

x / cosθ + y / sinθ = 1

And y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Substituting y into the equation:

x / cosθ + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) / sinθ = 1

Let me combine terms:

x (1/cosθ - sqrt(3)/sinθ) + (sqrt(3)/2)/sinθ = 1

So, that's:

x (secθ - sqrt(3) cscθ) + (sqrt(3)/2) cscθ =1.

Hmm. Let me factor out cscθ:

x ( (1/cosθ) - (sqrt(3)/sinθ) ) + (sqrt(3)/2)(1/sinθ) =1

Wait, maybe let's write this as:

x (1/cosθ - sqrt(3)/sinθ) = 1 - (sqrt(3)/2)(1/sinθ)

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, we can make this equation hold for some θ, but we want it to hold only for θ corresponding to AB.

Wait, for AB, p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2, which correspond to θ=60 degrees, since p=cos60°=1/2, q=sin60°=sqrt(3)/2.

So, for θ=60°, the equation holds.

But for other θ, we need the equation not to hold for our point C.

Wait, but C is on AB and we need it to not lie on any other PQ. So, for all θ≠60°, the equation x/cosθ + y/sinθ ≠1.

So, the equation x/cosθ + y/sinθ =1 should hold only when θ=60°, for our specific (x, y).

Therefore, the system:

1. y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2

2. x/cosθ + y/sinθ =1

3. p² + q²=1 (which is already satisfied by p=cosθ, q=sinθ)

We need to find (x, y) such that the second equation holds only when θ=60°.

So, perhaps the equation x/cosθ + y/sinθ =1 has only one solution θ=60°, which would mean that for our (x, y), the equation is satisfied only at θ=60°, and nowhere else.

So, let's consider x and y as variables dependent on θ, and find conditions where this equation only has θ=60° as a solution.

Wait, but x and y are fixed once we choose θ, but in our case, we are on AB, so x and y are related via y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the equation x secθ + y cscθ =1, which is equivalent to x/cosθ + y/sinθ =1.

So, let me express this as:

x secθ + y cscθ =1.

But since we're on AB, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Let's substitute that in:

x secθ + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) cscθ =1.

Let me factor out x and constants:

x (secθ - sqrt(3) cscθ) + (sqrt(3)/2) cscθ =1.

So, rearranged:

x (secθ - sqrt(3) cscθ) =1 - (sqrt(3)/2) cscθ.

So, x = [1 - (sqrt(3)/2) cscθ] / (secθ - sqrt(3) cscθ).

Hmm. Let me simplify this expression.

First, let's write in terms of sinθ and cosθ.

cscθ = 1/sinθ, secθ=1/cosθ.

So:

x = [1 - (sqrt(3)/2)(1/sinθ)] / (1/cosθ - sqrt(3)(1/sinθ)).

Multiply numerator and denominator by sinθ cosθ to eliminate denominators:

x = [ sinθ cosθ - (sqrt(3)/2) cosθ ] / [ cosθ - sqrt(3) sinθ ].

Wait, let's compute:

Numerator: [1 - (sqrt(3)/2)(1/sinθ)] * sinθ cosθ = sinθ cosθ - (sqrt(3)/2) cosθ

Denominator: [1/cosθ - sqrt(3)(1/sinθ)] * sinθ cosθ = sinθ - sqrt(3) cosθ

So, x = [ sinθ cosθ - (sqrt(3)/2) cosθ ] / [ sinθ - sqrt(3) cosθ ]

Factor numerator:

cosθ ( sinθ - sqrt(3)/2 ) 

Denominator: sinθ - sqrt(3) cosθ

So, x = [ cosθ ( sinθ - sqrt(3)/2 ) ] / [ sinθ - sqrt(3) cosθ ]

Hmm, interesting. Let me write denominator as sinθ - sqrt(3) cosθ.

Wait, let me factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: cosθ ( sinθ - sqrt(3)/2 )

Denominator: sinθ - sqrt(3) cosθ

Notice that denominator is similar to numerator, but with sqrt(3) instead of sqrt(3)/2.

Let me write denominator as:

sinθ - sqrt(3) cosθ = 2*( (1/2) sinθ - (sqrt(3)/2) cosθ )

Which is 2*( sinθ cos(60°) - cosθ sin(60°) ) = 2 sin(theta - 60°)

Since sin(A - B) = sinA cosB - cosA sinB.

Similarly, the numerator's ( sinθ - sqrt(3)/2 ) can be related.

Wait, sqrt(3)/2 is sin(60°), right? Because sin(60°)=sqrt(3)/2. So, sqrt(3)/2 is sin60°, and cos60°=1/2.

So, the numerator inside the brackets is sinθ - sin60°, which is sin(theta) - sin(60°).

Using the identity sinA - sinB = 2 cos( (A+B)/2 ) sin( (A - B)/2 )

So, sin(theta) - sin(60°) = 2 cos( (theta + 60°)/2 ) sin( (theta - 60°)/2 )

Similarly, the denominator is 2 sin(theta - 60°)

So, let's rewrite x:

x = [ cosθ * 2 cos( (theta + 60°)/2 ) sin( (theta - 60°)/2 ) ] / [ 2 sin(theta - 60°) ]

Simplify:

The 2's cancel:

x = [ cosθ * cos( (theta + 60°)/2 ) sin( (theta - 60°)/2 ) ] / [ sin(theta - 60°) ]

Notice that sin(theta - 60°) = 2 sin( (theta -60°)/2 ) cos( (theta -60°)/2 )

So, substituting:

x = [ cosθ * cos( (theta + 60°)/2 ) sin( (theta - 60°)/2 ) ] / [ 2 sin( (theta -60°)/2 ) cos( (theta -60°)/2 ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

sin( (theta -60°)/2 ) cancels out, so we have:

x = [ cosθ * cos( (theta + 60°)/2 ) ] / [ 2 cos( (theta -60°)/2 ) ]

Hmm, perhaps we can write cos(theta) in terms of the angles.

Wait, let me denote phi = theta -60°, so that theta = phi + 60°. Maybe that substitution would help.

Let me try that. Let phi = theta -60°, so theta = phi +60°, then (theta +60°)/2 = (phi +60° +60°)/2 = (phi +120°)/2 = 60° + phi/2.

Similarly, (theta -60°)/2 = (phi +60° -60°)/2 = phi/2.

So, substituting:

x = [ cos(phi +60°) * cos(60° + phi/2) ] / [ 2 cos( phi/2 ) ]

Hmm, perhaps using trigonometric identities. Let me recall that cos(A + B) = cosA cosB - sinA sinB.

So, cos(phi +60°) = cos(phi) cos60° - sin(phi) sin60° = (1/2) cos(phi) - (sqrt(3)/2) sin(phi).

So, substituting back:

x = [ ( (1/2) cos(phi) - (sqrt(3)/2) sin(phi) ) * cos(60° + phi/2) ] / [ 2 cos( phi/2 ) ]

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps instead of parametrizing in terms of theta, let me think of the envelope of all these lines PQ.

The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, perhaps the envelope of the lines PQ is a curve, and the point C is where AB is tangent to this envelope.

If that's the case, then C would be the point where AB is tangent to the envelope, and hence, it's the only point on AB that lies on such an envelope, meaning it doesn't lie on any other PQ except AB.

So, perhaps I should find the envelope of all these lines PQ.

The envelope can be found by solving the system:

1. F(p, q, x, y) = x/p + y/q -1 =0

2. The derivative of F with respect to a parameter set to zero. Since each PQ is parameterized by p and q with p² + q²=1, maybe we can use the condition for the envelope.

Wait, the envelope condition is that F=0 and dF/dλ=0, where λ is a parameter.

But here, each PQ is determined by p and q with p² + q²=1. So, perhaps the envelope is found by eliminating p and q from the equations F=0 and the derivative condition.

Alternatively, another method is to find the envelope for all lines x/p + y/q =1 with p² + q²=1.

So, let's try to find the envelope.

We can write F(p, q, x, y) = x/p + y/q -1 =0.

We also have the constraint G(p, q) = p² + q² -1 =0.

To find the envelope, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, where we solve for F and dF/dλ =0.

But perhaps a better approach is to parameterize p and q. As earlier, p=cosθ, q=sinθ.

So, F becomes x cosθ + y sinθ -1 =0.

Now, to find the envelope, we can differentiate F with respect to θ and set it to zero.

So, dF/dθ = -x sinθ + y cosθ =0.

So, the envelope is given by the system:

x cosθ + y sinθ =1,

and 

- x sinθ + y cosθ =0.

So, solving these two equations for x and y in terms of θ.

Let me write them again:

1. x cosθ + y sinθ =1,

2. -x sinθ + y cosθ =0.

We can solve this system for x and y.

From equation 2: y cosθ = x sinθ => y = x tanθ.

Substitute into equation 1:

x cosθ + (x tanθ) sinθ =1.

Simplify:

x cosθ + x (sin²θ / cosθ ) =1.

Factor x:

x [ cosθ + (sin²θ)/cosθ ] =1.

Combine terms:

x [ (cos²θ + sin²θ)/cosθ ] =1.

Since cos²θ + sin²θ=1,

x [ 1/cosθ ] =1 => x = cosθ.

Then, from equation 2, y = x tanθ = cosθ * tanθ = sinθ.

So, the envelope is given by x=cosθ, y=sinθ.

Wait, that's just the unit circle. But that can't be right because the lines x/p + y/q=1 for p² + q²=1 are all tangent to the unit circle at (p, q). So, the envelope is the unit circle itself.

Wait, that makes sense. Each line x/p + y/q=1 is tangent to the unit circle at (p, q), so the envelope is the unit circle. So, the envelope of family F is the unit circle.

So, the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the unit circle. Because if C is on AB and also lies on the envelope (the unit circle), then AB is tangent to the unit circle at C, meaning C is the only point on AB that lies on the envelope. Hence, C doesn't lie on any other segments PQ from F except AB, as required.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if AB is tangent to the unit circle at C, then C is the only point on AB that lies on the unit circle, hence, it's the only point on AB that lies on any PQ in F other than AB itself. Wait, but no, because F consists of segments PQ, which are the tangents to the unit circle. So, if AB is a tangent to the unit circle, then C is the point of tangency, and hence, the only point on AB that lies on F is AB itself. So, C is unique in that sense.

So, to find C, we can find the point where AB is tangent to the unit circle.

Wait, let's test if AB is tangent to the unit circle.

The equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

The distance from the center (0,0) to AB should be equal to 1 if AB is tangent to the unit circle. Let's compute the distance.

The formula for the distance from a point (x0, y0) to the line ax + by + c =0 is |ax0 + by0 +c| / sqrt(a² +b²).

First, write AB in standard form.

y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2

Bring all terms to one side:

sqrt(3)x + y - sqrt(3)/2 =0.

So, a = sqrt(3), b=1, c= -sqrt(3)/2.

The distance from (0,0) is |0 +0 - sqrt(3)/2| / sqrt( (sqrt(3))² +1² )= | -sqrt(3)/2 | / sqrt(3 +1)= (sqrt(3)/2)/2 = sqrt(3)/4.

But the unit circle has radius 1, so unless sqrt(3)/4=1, which it's not, the line AB is not tangent to the unit circle.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier reasoning. Hmm, so perhaps AB is not tangent to the unit circle, but the envelope is the unit circle, so the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope, which is the unit circle.

Wait, but since the distance from O to AB is sqrt(3)/4 <1, the line AB intersects the unit circle at two points. So, AB is a secant of the unit circle. Therefore, AB cannot be tangent to the unit circle.

Wait, so perhaps my earlier reasoning is flawed. If the envelope is the unit circle, but AB is not tangent to it, then AB would intersect the envelope at two points. But in our problem, point C is the only point on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ except AB. So, perhaps C is one of the intersection points of AB and the unit circle. But then, why only one such point?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the envelope. Wait, the envelope of the family F is the unit circle, but each PQ is a tangent to the unit circle. So, any line PQ is a tangent to the unit circle at (p, q). So, the envelope is the set of all such (p, q), which is the unit circle.

But AB is not a tangent to the unit circle. So, AB intersects the unit circle at two points. Let's find those points.

So, equation of unit circle: x² + y²=1.

Equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Let me substitute y into the unit circle equation:

x² + ( -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 )² =1.

Compute the square:

x² + (3x² - 2*(sqrt(3)x)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (3/4)) =1.

Simplify term by term:

First term: x²

Second term: (3x²) because (sqrt(3)x)^2 = 3x²

Third term: -2*(sqrt(3)x)*(sqrt(3)/2) = -2*(3x/2) = -3x

Fourth term: (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4

So, putting it all together:

x² + 3x² -3x + 3/4 =1

Combine like terms:

4x² -3x + 3/4 =1

Subtract 1:

4x² -3x -1/4 =0

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

16x² -12x -1 =0

Now, solve for x using quadratic formula:

x = [12 ± sqrt(144 + 64)] /32

Because discriminant D=144 +4*16*1=144 +64=208

sqrt(208)=sqrt(16*13)=4*sqrt(13)

So, x=(12 ±4sqrt(13))/32 = [12 ±4sqrt(13)] /32 = [3 ±sqrt(13)] /8

So, x1=(3 + sqrt(13))/8, x2=(3 - sqrt(13))/8.

Wait, but sqrt(13) is about 3.605, so 3 + sqrt(13) is about 6.605, which when divided by 8 is about 0.825, which is greater than 1/2 (since A is at x=1/2). But AB goes from x=0 to x=1/2, so x cannot be beyond 1/2. So, x1=(3 + sqrt(13))/8 is approximately 0.825, which is beyond 1/2, so it's not on AB.

x2=(3 - sqrt(13))/8. sqrt(13)≈3.605, so 3 - sqrt(13)≈-0.605, so x≈-0.605/8≈-0.0756, which is negative, but AB is from x=0 to x=1/2, so the point is not on AB.

Wait, that can't be right. Did I do the substitution correctly?

Wait, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, when x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2, which is point B. When x=1/2, y= -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + sqrt(3)/2=0, which is point A. So, AB is from (0, sqrt(3)/2) to (1/2, 0).

So, when I substituted into the unit circle, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the substitution step.

Equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Substituting into x² + y²=1:

x² + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]² =1.

Let me expand [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]²:

= ( -sqrt(3)x )² + 2*(-sqrt(3)x)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2

= 3x² + 2*(-3x/2) + 3/4

= 3x² -3x + 3/4

So, equation becomes:

x² + 3x² -3x + 3/4 =1

Which is 4x² -3x + 3/4 =1

Subtract 1: 4x² -3x -1/4=0

Multiply by 4: 16x² -12x -1=0.

So, correct so far.

Solutions:

x = [12 ± sqrt( (12)^2 -4*16*(-1) ) ]/(2*16) = [12 ± sqrt(144 +64)]/32 = [12 ± sqrt(208)]/32.

sqrt(208)=sqrt(16*13)=4 sqrt(13), so x=(12 ±4 sqrt(13))/32= [3 ±sqrt(13)]/8.

So, x=(3 + sqrt(13))/8≈(3+3.605)/8≈6.605/8≈0.825

x=(3 - sqrt(13))/8≈(3-3.605)/8≈(-0.605)/8≈-0.0756.

But AB is from x=0 to x=1/2=0.5. So, (3 + sqrt(13))/8≈0.825 is beyond 0.5, so not on AB. (3 - sqrt(13))/8≈-0.0756 is negative, so also not on AB.

So, AB doesn't intersect the unit circle within the segment AB. Therefore, AB doesn't intersect the envelope (the unit circle) on the segment between A and B.

Hmm, that's a problem because I thought the envelope was the unit circle, but if AB doesn't intersect it, then perhaps my earlier conclusion is wrong.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, point C is on AB and doesn't belong to any other segment from F except AB. So, C is on AB, so it's on AB, but the problem is that AB itself is part of F, so C is on AB, and since AB is in F, then C is on AB (which is in F), and the problem says it doesn't belong to any other segment from F except AB. So, C is on AB, but not on any other PQ in F.

So, perhaps the point C is the point on AB which is closest to O, because if it's the closest, then it won't lie on any other PQ from F, which are all unit length segments from x to y axes.

Wait, let me compute the distance from O to AB. The distance from O to AB is |sqrt(3)/4|, as computed earlier. So, the point on AB closest to O is at distance sqrt(3)/4, which is about 0.433. But the unit segments PQ are of length 1, so perhaps the closest point C is the only one that doesn't lie on any other PQ.

Wait, but how do I know that? Maybe I need to find the point C on AB such that the line from P to Q passes through C, but for any other PQ, C isn't on it.

Wait, perhaps using the concept of dual curves or something else.

Alternatively, since all segments PQ are of length 1, and lie in the first quadrant, perhaps the region covered by all such PQ is a certain area, and point C is the point on AB that's not covered by any other PQ.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize each PQ as a line, and find the point C on AB that's not on any of these lines except AB.

So, for each PQ in F, the line x/p + y/q =1 with p² + q²=1. We want to find the point (x, y) on AB such that for no other p and q (with p² + q²=1) does x/p + y/q=1 hold.

So, for point C on AB, with coordinates (x, y) = ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3) t)/2 ), we need to ensure that the equation x/p + y/q=1 has only one solution (p, q)= (1/2, sqrt(3)/2 ), which is the case when PQ is AB itself.

So, the equation ( (1 - t)/2 ) / p + ( (sqrt(3) t)/2 ) / q =1 must have only one solution (p, q) on the unit circle p² + q²=1, which is when PQ=AB.

So, to find t such that this equation has only one solution, which is when (p, q)=(1/2, sqrt(3)/2).

So, let's set up the equation:

( (1 - t)/2 ) / p + ( (sqrt(3) t)/2 ) / q =1, with p² + q²=1.

Let me denote a= (1 - t)/2 and b= (sqrt(3) t)/2, so the equation becomes a/p + b/q =1.

We can write this as:

a q + b p = pq

Which rearranges to:

pq - a q - b p =0.

Factor:

q(p -a) - b p =0.

Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, let's write it as:

pq - a q - b p =0.

We can factor this as:

q(p -a) - b p=0 => q(p -a)=b p => q= (b p)/(p -a), provided p≠a.

But since p² + q² =1, substituting q:

p² + [ (b p)/(p -a) ]² =1.

So,

p² + (b² p²)/(p -a)^2 =1.

Multiply both sides by (p -a)^2:

p² (p -a)^2 + b² p² = (p -a)^2.

Let me expand p² (p - a)^2:

= p² (p² - 2 a p + a² )

= p^4 - 2 a p^3 + a² p^2.

So, overall equation:

p^4 - 2 a p^3 + a² p^2 + b² p^2 = (p -a)^2.

Expand (p -a)^2: p² - 2 a p + a².

So,

p^4 -2 a p^3 + a² p^2 + b² p^2 = p² -2 a p +a².

Bring all terms to left:

p^4 -2 a p^3 + a² p^2 + b² p^2 - p² +2 a p -a²=0.

Combine like terms:

p^4 -2 a p^3 + (a² + b² -1) p^2 + 2 a p -a²=0.

This is a quartic equation in p. For our point C to be only on AB and not on any other PQ, this equation must have only one real solution, which is p=1/2 (since then q= sqrt(3)/2).

So, the quartic equation must have a quadruple root at p=1/2 or something, but more likely, it should have p=1/2 as a double root or something.

But perhaps a better approach is to ensure that the quartic equation has (p - 1/2)^2 as a factor because that would correspond to the line AB (which is in F) being the only solution.

So, let me set up the quartic equation as:

(p - 1/2)^2 (some quadratic) =0.

But perhaps I can use polynomial division. Let me try dividing the quartic by (p - 1/2)^2.

But before that, let's substitute a and b in terms of t.

We have a=(1 - t)/2, b=(sqrt(3) t)/2.

So, plug a and b into the quartic equation:

p^4 -2 a p^3 + (a² + b² -1) p^2 + 2 a p -a²=0.

Replace a and b:

p^4 -2*( (1 - t)/2 ) p^3 + [ ( (1 - t)/2 )^2 + ( (sqrt(3) t)/2 )^2 -1 ] p^2 + 2*( (1 - t)/2 ) p - ( (1 - t)/2 )^2 =0.

Simplify each term:

1. p^4

2. -2*( (1 - t)/2 ) p^3 = -(1 - t) p^3

3. [ ( (1 - 2t + t²)/4 ) + (3 t² /4 ) -1 ] p^2

= [ (1 -2t + t² +3 t² ) /4 -1 ] p^2

= [ (1 -2t +4 t²)/4 -1 ] p^2

= [ (1 -2t +4 t² -4)/4 ] p^2

= [ (-3 -2t +4 t² ) /4 ] p^2

4. 2*( (1 - t)/2 ) p = (1 - t) p

5. - ( (1 - t)/2 )^2 = - (1 - 2t + t² ) /4

So, putting it all together:

p^4 - (1 - t) p^3 + [ (-3 -2t +4 t² ) /4 ] p^2 + (1 - t) p - (1 - 2t + t² ) /4 =0.

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:

4 p^4 -4(1 - t) p^3 + (-3 -2t +4 t² ) p^2 +4(1 - t) p - (1 - 2t + t² )=0.

Now, let's arrange the terms:

4 p^4 -4(1 - t) p^3 + (4 t² -2 t -3 ) p^2 +4(1 - t) p - (t² -2 t +1 )=0.

We want this quartic to have p=1/2 as a double root, so (p -1/2)^2 is a factor.

Let me perform polynomial division. Let me write the quartic as Q(p) and divide by (p -1/2)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write Q(p) = (p -1/2)^2 (A p² + B p + C )

Then, expand and equate coefficients.

Let me assume Q(p) = (p -1/2)^2 (A p² + B p + C )

= (p² - p + 1/4)(A p² + B p + C )

Multiply out:

= A p^4 + B p^3 + C p^2 - A p^3 - B p^2 - C p + (A/4) p² + (B/4) p + C/4.

Combine like terms:

= A p^4 + (B - A) p^3 + (C - B + A/4) p^2 + (-C + B/4) p + C/4.

Set this equal to Q(p):

4 p^4 -4(1 - t) p^3 + (4 t² -2 t -3 ) p^2 +4(1 - t) p - (t² -2 t +1 )=0.

So, equate coefficients:

1. A =4

2. B - A = -4(1 - t)

3. C - B + A/4 =4 t² -2 t -3

4. -C + B/4 =4(1 - t )

5. C/4 = - (t² -2 t +1 )

So, let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 1: A=4.

Equation 2: B -4 = -4(1 - t ) => B =4 -4(1 -t )=4 -4 +4t=4t.

Equation 5: C/4= - (t² -2t +1 )= - ( (t -1)^2 )

So, C= -4(t -1)^2.

Equation 4: -C + B/4 =4(1 -t )

Substitute B=4t, C=-4(t-1)^2:

-(-4(t-1)^2 ) + (4t)/4 =4(1 -t )

=> 4(t-1)^2 + t =4(1 -t )

Expand 4(t-1)^2=4(t² -2t +1)=4t² -8t +4.

So,

4t² -8t +4 +t =4 -4t.

Combine like terms:

4t² -7t +4 =4 -4t.

Bring all terms to left:

4t² -7t +4 -4 +4t=0

Simplify:

4t² -3t=0

Factor:

t(4t -3)=0.

So, t=0 or t=3/4.

t=0 would correspond to point A, which we are excluding, so t=3/4.

So, t=3/4.

Now, let's check equation 3 to verify.

Equation 3: C - B + A/4=4 t² -2 t -3.

We have C=-4(t-1)^2, B=4t, A=4.

So,

C - B + A/4 =-4(t-1)^2 -4t +4/4= -4(t² -2t +1 ) -4t +1= -4t² +8t -4 -4t +1= -4t² +4t -3.

Set equal to RHS:

4 t² -2 t -3 = -4t² +4t -3.

Bring all terms to left:

4t² -2t -3 +4t² -4t +3=0 =>8t² -6t=0 =>2t(4t -3)=0.

Solutions t=0 or t=3/4.

Which is consistent with previous solutions.

So, t=3/4 is the solution.

So, point C is at t=3/4.

So, coordinates:

x=(1 - t)/2=(1 - 3/4)/2=(1/4)/2=1/8.

y=(sqrt(3) t)/2= (sqrt(3)*3/4)/2= (3 sqrt(3))/8.

So, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

Now, compute OC².

OC²= x² + y²= (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2=1/64 + (27)/64=28/64=7/16.

So, OC²=7/16.

Thus, p=7, q=16, p+q=23.


To solve the problem, we first identify the family of segments $\overline{PQ}$ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. Each segment $\overline{PQ}$ can be represented by the equation $\frac{x}{p} + \frac{y}{q} = 1$ where $p^2 + q^2 = 1$. The envelope of these segments forms the unit circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.

The segment $\overline{AB}$ connects $A\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)$ and $B\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$ and has the equation $y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. We need to find the unique point $C$ on $\overline{AB}$ that does not lie on any other segment from $\mathcal{F}$ except $\overline{AB}$. This point $C$ is the point where $\overline{AB}$ is tangent to the unit circle.

To find $C$, we solve the system:
1. $x^2 + y^2 = 1$
2. $y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$

Substituting the equation of $AB$ into the unit circle equation, we solve for $x$ and find the coordinates of $C$. After simplification, we determine that $C$ is at $\left(\frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)$. Calculating $OC^2$ gives:
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}.
\]
Thus, $OC^2 = \frac{7}{16}$, and $p + q = 7 + 16 = 23$.

$\boxed{23}$
