Alright, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine both rectangles, they must be placed such that these four points lie on a straight line. Also, all points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That means these four points are concyclic, or they lie on the same circumference. 

The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

Okay, let me start by drawing a rough sketch. I think the rectangles are placed side by side, but since D, E, C, F are collinear, maybe they are arranged in some other way. Let me try to assign coordinates to the points to make it easier.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (x,0), B at (x,y), and A at (0,y). Wait, no, BC is 16, so BC is the side of the rectangle. BC is one of the sides, so in rectangle ABCD, AB and CD are the lengths, and BC and AD are the widths. So AB = 107, BC = 16. So, if I place D at (0,0), then C would be at (107, 0), B at (107, 16), and A at (0,16). Hmm, wait, no, wait. AB is the length. Let me think: in rectangle ABCD, AB is one side and BC is another. So if AB = 107, and BC = 16, then AB is the length and BC is the width. So, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (107, 0), B at (107, 16), and A at (0,16). Right.

Now, the other rectangle is EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, point D is at (0,0), and point C is at (107,0). So the line DC is the x-axis from (0,0) to (107,0). Points E and F are somewhere on this line.

Wait, but the rectangle EFGH, so points E, F, G, H. Let me think about how the rectangle is placed. Since E and F are on DC, which is the x-axis, perhaps E and F are points on the x-axis, and G and H are somewhere else.

But also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So points A (0,16), D (0,0), H, and G all lie on a circle. So the circle passes through (0,0) and (0,16), and points H and G.

Alright, so let me think about the rectangle EFGH. Since E and F are on DC (the x-axis), and EFGH is a rectangle, then sides EF and FG are sides of the rectangle. Given FG = 17 and EF = 184.

Wait, so EF is 184. Since EF is a side of the rectangle, which is on the x-axis, then F is to the right of E. So if E is at (e,0), then F is at (e + 184, 0). But wait, but the rectangle EFGH is a rectangle, so the sides EF and FG are perpendicular. So FG is 17, which would be the height. So from F, moving up (or down) 17 units to get to G. So point G would be at (e + 184, 17) or (e + 184,
