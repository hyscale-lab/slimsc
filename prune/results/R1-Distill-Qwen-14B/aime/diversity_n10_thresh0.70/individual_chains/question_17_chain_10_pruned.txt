Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a set of rectangular boxes, each with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Hmm, I remember that for a rectangular box with sides of length x, y, z, the surface area is 2(xy + yz + xz) and the volume is xyz. So, given that surface area is 54 and volume is 23, I can write these as equations:

2(xy + yz + xz) = 54

and

xyz = 23.

I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any such box. The sphere's radius would be half the space diagonal of the box, right? Because the space diagonal is the longest distance inside the box, so the sphere must have a diameter equal to that diagonal.

So, the space diagonal d of the box with sides x, y, z is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r is d/2, so r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, my goal is to minimize the space diagonal, which is equivalent to minimizing (x² + y² + z²) since the radius is proportional to the square root of that sum.

Wait, actually, since r² is (x² + y² + z²)/4, to minimize r², I need to minimize x² + y² + z².

So, I need to find the minimum of x² + y² + z² given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I think I can use Lagrange multipliers here, but maybe there's a smarter way with inequalities.

I recall that for positive real numbers, there are inequalities that relate sums, products, and other symmetric expressions. Maybe I can use the AM-QM inequality or something similar.

Let me think. I have three variables x, y, z. I know their sum of products (xy + yz + xz) is 27, because 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, so xy + yz + xz = 27.

And I know that xyz = 23.

I need to find the minimum of x² + y² + z².

I remember that for any real numbers, x² + y² + z² >= xy + yz + xz. So, x² + y² + z² >= 27.

But wait, is that tight? Because for that inequality, equality holds when x = y = z. But in our case, if x = y = z, then the box is a cube. Let's check if that's possible.

If x = y = z, then the surface area would be 6x² = 54 → x² = 9 → x = 3.

Then, volume would be 3³ = 27. But in our problem, volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, a cube isn't possible here, which means x, y, z cannot all be equal. So, the minimum of x² + y² + z² must be greater than 27.

Therefore, I need another approach.

Perhaps I can express x² + y² + z² in terms of (x + y + z)^2. Because (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz). So, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + xz).

Given that xy + yz + xz = 27, so x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.

So, to minimize x² + y² + z², I need to minimize (x + y + z)^2, which is equivalent to minimizing x + y + z.

So, if I can find the minimum value of x + y + z given that xyz = 23 and xy + yz + xz = 27, then I can find x² + y² + z².

Hmm, this seems tricky. Maybe I can use the AM >= GM inequality?

Wait, for three positive numbers, the AM of x, y, z is (x + y + z)/3, and GM is (xyz)^(1/3). So, AM >= GM. So, (x + y + z)/3 >= (23)^(1/3). Therefore, x + y + z >= 3*(23)^(1/3
