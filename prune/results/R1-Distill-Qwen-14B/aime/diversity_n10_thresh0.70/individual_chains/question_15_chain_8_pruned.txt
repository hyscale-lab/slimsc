Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths need to be of length 16, starting from the lower left corner and ending at the upper right corner. Additionally, these paths should change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that in a grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right without any restrictions, the number of shortest paths is given by the binomial coefficient. For an 8x8 grid, moving from (0,0) to (8,8), you need 8 right moves and 8 up moves, so the total number of paths is C(16,8). But that's without any restrictions on direction changes.

Now, the problem specifies that the path must change direction exactly four times. So, I need to think about how direction changes occur in such paths. Each time the path switches from moving right to up or up to right, that's a direction change. 

Let me consider how direction changes relate to the number of segments in the path. For example, if a path has four direction changes, that would mean it's made up of five straight segments. Wait, no, actually, each direction change adds a new segment. So, starting with one segment (all right or all up), each change adds another segment. So, four changes would mean five segments in total.

Wait, but in our case, the path is from (0,0) to (8,8), so it must start either right or up. Let me think about that. If I start by moving right, then each time I change direction, I switch to up, then right, then up, etc. So, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times you switch between the two directions.

So, if I have four direction changes, the path would have five segments. Each segment is a consecutive set of right or up moves. So, the path alternates between right and up segments, starting with either right or up.

So, to model this, perhaps I can consider the structure of the path as a sequence of right and up segments, with exactly four direction changes, meaning five segments in total.

Each path must consist of five segments, alternating between right and up. The starting direction can be either right or up, so there are two possibilities for the overall direction pattern.

Let me formalize this. Let's say the path starts with a right segment. Then, the
