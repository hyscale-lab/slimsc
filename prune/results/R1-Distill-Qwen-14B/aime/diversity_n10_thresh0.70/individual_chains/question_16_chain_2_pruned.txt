Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, okay. I'll try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. So, we're looking for the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Once we find that p, we then have to find the smallest m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Alright, so step one is to find the smallest prime p where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² for some n. Then, once p is found, find the minimal m that satisfies m⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

I think I should start by checking small primes to see if they satisfy the condition. Let's list some small primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. Let's go one by one.

Starting with p = 2. Let's see if there exists an n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by 2² = 4. Let's compute n⁴ mod 4. For any integer n, n mod 4 can be 0,1,2,3.

If n ≡ 0 mod 4: n⁴ ≡ 0 mod 4, so n⁴ +1 ≡ 1 mod 4, which is not 0.

If n ≡1 mod 4: 1⁴ = 1, so 1+1=2 mod 4, which is 2, not 0.

n ≡2 mod 4: 16 mod 4 is 0, so 0 +1=1 mod4, again not 0.

n ≡3 mod4: 81 mod4 is 1, so 1+1=2 mod4, again not 0.

So, n⁴ +1 is never divisible by 4, so p=2 doesn't work.

Next prime is 3. Let's check if there's an n such that n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod9.

Compute n⁴ mod9 for n from 0 to 8 (since mod9 cycles every 9 numbers).

n=0: 0⁴=0 → 0+1=1 mod9
n=1:1→1+1=2
n=2:16→7→7+1=8
n=3:81→0→0+1=1
n=4:256 mod9. 256 ÷9 is 28*9=252, so 256-252=4 →4+1=5
n=5:625 mod9. 625 ÷9=69*9=621, 625-621=4 → same as n=4: 4+1=5
n=6: 6⁴=1296 →0 mod9 →0+1=1
n=7: 7⁴=2401 mod9. 2401 ÷9: 9*266=2394, 2401-2394=7 →7+1=8
n=8:8⁴=4096 mod9. 4096 ÷9: 455*9=4095, 4096-4095=1 →1+1=2

So none of the residues for n⁴ +1 mod9 give 0. So p=3 is out.

Next prime is 5. Let's check if n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod25.

We can compute n⁴ mod25 for n from 0 to24, but that's a lot. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way.

First, let's check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod5; if that's possible, maybe we can lift it to mod25 using Hensel's lemma or something.

Wait, for p=5, first check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod5.

Compute n⁴ mod5 for n=0,1,2,3,4:

n=0:0
n=1:1
n=2:16→1 mod5
n=3:81→1 mod5
n=4:256→1 mod5

So n⁴ mod5 can only be 0 or 1. So -1 mod5 is 4, which is not achievable by n⁴ mod5. Therefore, there is no n such that n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod5, let alone mod25. Therefore, p=5 is out.

Next prime is 7. Let's check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod7²=49.

First, check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod7. So in mod7, what is n⁴?

Compute n from 0 to6:

n=0:0⁴=0
n=1:1
n=2:16 mod7=2
n=3:81 mod7=4 (since 7*11=77, 81-77=4)
n=4: 256 mod7. 7*36=252, 256-252=4 →4
n=5:625 mod7. 7*89=623, 625-623=2 →2
n=6:1296 mod7. 7*185=1295, 1296-1295=1 →1

So n⁴ mod7 can be 0,1,2,4.

-1 mod7 is 6, which is not in the set {0,1,2,4}, so n⁴ ≡-1 mod7 is impossible. Therefore, p=7 is out.

Next prime is 11.

Wait, maybe I should check 13 instead? Wait, no, 11 is the next prime after 7.

Wait, primes after 7 are 11, 13, 17, etc. So next is p=11.

But let's check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod11.

Compute n⁴ mod11 for n=0 to10.

n=0:0
n=1:1
n=2:16 mod11=5
n=3:81 mod11. 11*7=77, 81-77=4 →4
n=4:256 mod11. 11*23=253, 256-253
