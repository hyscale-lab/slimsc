Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it out step by step.

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis with length 2a, where a²=20, so a=2√5. The conjugate axis is along the y-axis with length 2b, where b²=24, so b=2√6.

Now, we have four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, no, wait no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, now I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, yes, that's right. Because in a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's an important property.

Given that, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means each diagonal is a line through the origin. So, if ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, then points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and points B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal.

So, if A is (x, y), then C would be (-x, -y) because the midpoint is the origin. Similarly, B would be (p, q) and D would be (-p, -q).

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, and so on.

But another approach is to consider the properties of the
