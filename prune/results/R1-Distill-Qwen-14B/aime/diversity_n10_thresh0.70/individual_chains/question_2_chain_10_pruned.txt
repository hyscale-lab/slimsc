Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, point A is on the x-axis, halfway between O and (1,0), and point B is on the y-axis, at a height of sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866. 

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ in F connects a point P on the x-axis to a point Q on the y-axis, and the length of PQ is 1. 

The problem says there's a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that doesn't belong to any other segment from F except AB. So, C is a special point on AB that isn't covered by any other PQ in F. We need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.

Hmm. Let me visualize this. We have the x-axis and y-axis, and points A and B. The segment AB connects (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me sketch that mentally. That should form a line in the first quadrant, somewhere between the x and y axes.

Now, the family F is all segments PQ of length 1 with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis. So, for each P, Q, PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q), with sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So, p and q must satisfy p² + q² = 1.

Each such segment PQ is a line connecting (p,0) to (0,q), and it lies in the first quadrant because both p and q are positive (since we're in the first quadrant). So, these are all the segments from the x-axis to the y-axis that have a length of 1.

Now, the point C is on AB, and it's unique in that it's not on any other PQ from F except AB itself. So, for all other segments PQ in F, C is not on them. So, AB is one such segment in F, but C is not on any other PQ in F.

Wait, but AB is a segment from A to B, which are (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me calculate the length of AB to see if it's part of F.

The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt(1) = 1. So, AB is indeed a member of family F. So, AB is one of the segments in F, so C is on AB, but not on any other segment in F.

So, our task is to find point C on AB such that for all other PQ in F, C is not on PQ. Thus, C is only on AB and no other PQ in F.

So, how do we find such a point C?

I think the idea is that for point C, the line AB is the only segment PQ in F that passes through it. So, for all other segments PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

So, perhaps we can find the point C where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. Alternatively, maybe C is where AB is the only PQ in F passing through it, meaning that if we consider all possible PQ segments of length 1, the point C is where only AB passes through, and no other PQ does.

Alternatively, maybe we can parametrize all the segments in F and see where they intersect AB, then find the point C that is an intersection only with AB and not with any other segment in F.

Wait, let's think about parametrizing the family F.

Each segment PQ is from (p,0) to (0,q), with p² + q² = 1, as the length is 1.

So, for each p in (0,1), q is sqrt(1 - p²). So, each PQ connects (p,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p²)).

The equation of the line PQ can be written as x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = 1.

Alternatively, in intercept form, the line PQ is x/(p) + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = 1.

So, the family F consists of all such lines for p in (0,1).

We can parametrize each line in F by p, so each p gives a line.

Now, AB is a specific line in F, since when p = 1/2, the corresponding q would be sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2) = sqrt(3)/2, which is exactly point B. So, AB is PQ with p = 1/2.

Now, the point C is on AB, so it's on the line AB. Let me find the equation of AB first.

Points A and B are (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2), which simplifies to y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, point C is on AB, so it can be represented as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) for some x between 0 and 1/2.

We need to find x such that this point lies only on AB and no other PQ in F.

So, suppose point C is (x, y), where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, and 0 < x < 1/2.

We need to ensure that this point is not on any other PQ in F, meaning that there's no other p (apart from p=1/2) such that x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = 1.

So, for each x, we can solve for p in the equation x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = 1. If there is only one solution for p (which would be p=1/2), then that x corresponds to point C.

Let me set up the equation:

x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = 1

But y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Substituting that in:

x/p + [ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) ] / sqrt(1 - p²) = 1

Hmm. So, for each x, this is an equation in p. We need this equation to have exactly one
