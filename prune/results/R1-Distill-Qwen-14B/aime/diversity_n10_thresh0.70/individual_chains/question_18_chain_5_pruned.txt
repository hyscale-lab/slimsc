Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (which is a 12-sided polygon). Each side of the rectangle has to lie either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram shows three examples, but I can't see the diagram, so I'll have to visualize it or maybe sketch it out to get a better idea.

First, I remember that in a regular polygon, a rectangle would be formed by selecting four points such that their connecting sides are either sides or diagonals of the polygon. But wait, not any four points will form a rectangle. The sides of the rectangle must be either sides of the polygon or diagonals, which means the sides must be parallel to the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

Since a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, each internal angle is 150 degrees, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. What's important is that the sides and diagonals have certain symmetries and lengths.

I think the key here is to consider the diagonals of the dodecagon because, in a regular polygon, diagonals can be of different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. For a rectangle to be formed, the opposite sides must be equal and parallel, and the angles must be right angles.

Wait, in a regular dodecagon, are there diagonals that are perpendicular? Hmm, that might be a bit tricky. Maybe I should think about how rectangles can be inscribed in a regular polygon.

Another approach is to consider that a rectangle is defined by two pairs of parallel sides. So, in the context of the dodecagon, these pairs of sides must be either sides of the polygon or diagonals that are parallel to each other.

So, the problem reduces to finding all sets of four points where two pairs of points are connected by parallel sides or diagonals, and the angles between these pairs are right angles.

But how do I systematically count these?

Let me think about the properties of a regular dodecagon. Each vertex can be connected to other vertices via sides or diagonals. The diagonals can be categorized based on how many vertices they skip. For example, in a regular n-gon, a diagonal that skips k vertices connects two vertices that are k+1 steps apart.

In a dodecagon, the possible diagon
