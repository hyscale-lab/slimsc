Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The torus T is created by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in the same plane as the circle. The axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, it's like a donut shape. The sphere S has a radius of 11. 

When the torus rests inside the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it's outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find r_i - r_o, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. I think I need to visualize this. A torus is a surface of revolution, so it's like a ring-shaped object. The sphere is another surface. When the torus is inside the sphere, they touch along a circle, and similarly when it's outside.

Let me recall the standard equations for a torus and a sphere. The torus can be described in 3D coordinates. If the generating circle has radius a, and the distance from the center of that circle to the axis of revolution is R, then the equation of the torus is:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = a²

In this case, a is 3 and R is 6. So the equation would be:

(√(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 9

The sphere S has a radius of 11, so its equation is:

x² + y² + z² = 121

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the tangent point is a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, the tangent point is another circle. I need to find the radii of these circles, r_i and r_o.

Wait, but the problem says that the torus is tangent along a circle with radius r_i or r_o. So, these are circles (great circles, perhaps?) on the sphere. So, I'm looking for the radii of these circles of tangency.

Let me think about how to find these points where the torus and sphere are tangent.

In 3D, two surfaces are tangent at a point if they share a common tangent plane at that point. But in this case, the tangency is along a whole circle, so every point on that circle is a point of tangency.

I think the circle of tangency lies on both the torus and the sphere, and the tangent planes at every point on this circle are the same for both surfaces.

So, perhaps we can find the equations of the torus and sphere and set up the condition that they intersect along a circle, and that their normals are colinear at every point on that circle.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think about this in terms of the centers of the spheres or distances.

Wait, another approach: the torus can be considered as a surface where every point is at a distance of 3 from a circle of radius
