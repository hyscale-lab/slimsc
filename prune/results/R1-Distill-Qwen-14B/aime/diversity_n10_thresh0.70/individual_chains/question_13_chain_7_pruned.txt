Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walk and coffee shop visits. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the problem says she walks 9 kilometers every morning. When she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, the walk takes her 4 hours, but that includes t minutes in the coffee shop. Then, when she walks at s+2 km/h, the walk time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, still including t minutes. Now, they're asking what the total time would be if she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the same t minutes.

Alright, let's break this down. First, the time she spends walking plus the time she spends in the coffee shop equals the total time given. 

So, when she walks at speed s, the walking time is 4 hours minus t minutes. Similarly, when she walks at s+2, the walking time is 2 hours 24 minutes minus t minutes. But wait, I need to make sure the units are consistent. Since the speed is in km/h, the time should be in hours as well.

Let me convert everything into hours. So, t minutes is t/60 hours. 

For the first scenario:
Walking speed = s km/h
Total time = 4 hours = walking time + coffee time
Walking time = 4 - (t/60) hours
Distance = speed × time, so 9 = s × (4 - t/60).

Second scenario:
Walking speed = s + 2 km/h
Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait, no. 24 minutes is 0.4 hours. So total time is 2.4 hours.
Walking time = 2.4 - (t/60) hours
Distance = (s + 2) × (2.4 - t/60) = 9.

So now I have two equations:

1) 9 = s * (4 - t/60)
2) 9 = (s + 2) * (2.4 - t/60)

Hmm, so two equations with two variables s and t. I can solve this system.

Let me write them more clearly:

Equation 1: s*(4 - t/60) = 9
Equation 2: (s + 2)*(2.4 - t/60) = 9

I can try to express both in terms of s and t and then solve.

Let me expand Equation 1:

4s - (s*t)/60 = 9

Similarly, Equation 2:

(s + 2)*(2.4 - t/60) = 9
Expanding this:

s*(2.4 - t/60) + 2*(2.4 - t/60) = 9
Which is 2.4s - (s*t)/60 + 4.8 - (2t)/60 = 9

So now I have:

Equation 1: 4s - (s t)/60 = 9
Equation 2: 2.4s - (s t)/60 + 4.8 - (2t)/60 = 9

Hmm, maybe I can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 or find another way to eliminate variables.

Wait, maybe I can subtract the two equations to eliminate (s t)/60.

Let me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

[2.4s - (s t)/60 + 4.8 - (2t)/60] - [4s - (s t)/60] = 9 - 9

Simplify:

2.4s - (s t)/60 +4.8 - (2t)/60 -4s + (s t)/60 = 0

The (s t)/60 terms cancel out.

So:

2.4s -4s +4.8 - (2t)/60 = 0

Which simplifies to:

-1.6s +4.8 - (2t)/60 = 0

Multiply all terms by 60 to eliminate denominators:

-1.6s *60 +4.8*60 -2t = 0

Calculating:

-96s + 288 -2t = 0

Hmm, maybe I can rearrange this:

-96s -2t = -288

Divide both sides by -2:

48s + t = 144

So, t = 144 -48s.

Okay, that's an expression for t in terms of s. Now, I can plug this into one of the original equations to find s and t.

Let's use Equation 1: 4s - (s t)/60 = 9

Substituting t = 144 -48s:

4s - [s*(144 -48s)]/60 = 9

Let me compute the term [s*(144 -48s)] first:

= s*(144 -48s) = 144s -48s²

Now, divide by 60:

(144s -48s²)/60 = (12*12 s - 12*4 s²)/60? Wait, maybe I can factor this:

144 = 12*12, 48=12*4, 60=12*5.

So,

(144s -48s²)/60 = [12*(12s -4s²)] / (12*5) )= (12s -4s²)/5.

So, Equation 1 becomes:

4s - (12s -4s²)/5 = 9

Let me write this as:

4s - (12s -4s²)/5 = 9

To combine terms, multiply numerator:

Multiply 4s by 5/5 to get a common denominator:

(20s/5) - (12s -4s²)/5 = 9

Combine the numerators:

[20s -12s +4s²]/5 = 9

Which is:

(8s +4s²)/5 = 9

Multiply both sides by 5:

8s +4s² = 45

Bring all terms to one side:

4s² +8s -45 = 0

This is a quadratic equation. Let me write it as:

4s² +8s -45 = 0

I can use the quadratic formula to solve for s.

The quadratic formula is s = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a =4, b=8, c=-45.

So,

s = [-8 ± sqrt(8² -4*4*(-45))]/(2*4)
s = [-8 ± sqrt(64 + 720)]/8
s = [-8 ± sqrt(784)]/8
sqrt(784)=28

So,

s = [-8 ±28]/8

We have two solutions:

s = (-8 +28)/8 = 20/8 = 2.5

s = (-8 -28)/8 = (-36)/8 = -4.5

But speed can't be negative, so s =2.5 km/h.

Now, using t =144 -48s:

t =144 -48*2.5

48*2.5 = 120

So, t=144-120=24 minutes.

Okay, so t is 24 minutes. Let me confirm with the original equations.

First, when s=2.5:

Walking time at s=2.5 km/h:

Total time=4h, coffee time=24min=0.4h

Walking time=4 -0.4=3.6h.

Distance=2.5*3.6=9 km. Correct.

Second scenario, s+2=4.5 km/h.

Total time=2h24min=2.4h.

Coffee time=0.4h, so walking time=2.4-0.4=2h.

Distance=4.5*2=9 km. Correct.

Great, so s=2.5 km/h and t=24 minutes.

Now, the problem asks: Suppose Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

So, new speed is s + 0.5 =2.5 +0.5=3 km/h.

So, find the total time, including coffee, when she walks at 3 km/h.

First, find the walking time. Distance is 9 km.

Walking time = 9 /3 =3 hours.

But wait, that's just the walking time. The total time is walking time plus t minutes.

t is 24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours.

So, total
