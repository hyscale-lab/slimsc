Okay, so I have this math problem about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to understand what's going on here. 

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and then stops at a coffee shop. The problem gives me two scenarios about her walking speed and the time it takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, again including the coffee shop time.

Hmm, let's break down the information provided.

First scenario: She walks at a constant speed of s km/h. The total time taken for the walk is 4 hours, which includes t minutes spent in the coffee shop. 

Wait, so does that mean that the walking time plus the coffee shop time equals 4 hours? Or is the 4 hours only the walking time? Hmm, the problem says "the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes..." So I think the 4 hours includes both the walking and the coffee shop time. So, the total time from start to finish is 4 hours, which includes the time she spends walking and the time in the coffee shop.

Similarly, the second scenario: She walks at s + 2 km/h, and the total time taken is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes in the coffee shop. 

So, same structure. The total time includes walking plus coffee shop time.

We need to find the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, again including t minutes.

So, I think we need to find s and t first, right? Because once we have those, we can compute the time for the new speed.

Let me write down the equations based on the two scenarios.

First, when she walks at s km/h, the walking time is distance divided by speed. So, walking time is 9 / s hours. Then, the total time is 4 hours, which is walking time plus coffee shop time. But the coffee shop time is t minutes, which is t/60 hours. So, the equation would be:

Walking time + coffee shop time = total time
(9 / s) + (t / 60) = 4

Similarly, for the second scenario, her speed is s + 2 km/h. So, walking time is 9 / (s + 2) hours. The total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let's convert that into hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total time is 2.4 hours. So, the equation is:

(9 / (s + 2)) + (t / 60) = 2.4

Now, I have two equations:

1) (9 / s) + (t / 60) = 4
2) (9 / (s + 2)) + (t / 60) = 2.4

Hmm, so I can set up these two equations and solve for s and t.

Let me denote t/60 as a single variable to simplify. Let me call it C. So, C = t / 60. Then, the equations become:

9/s + C = 4
9/(s + 2) + C = 2.4

Now, subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate C.

(9/s + C) - (9/(s + 2) + C) = 4 - 2.4
9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Let me compute 9/s - 9/(s + 2):

= 9(1/s - 1/(s + 2))
= 9[(s + 2 - s) / (s(s + 2))]
= 9[2 / (s(s + 2))]
= 18 / [s(s + 2)]

So, 18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Let me write that as:

18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Multiply both sides by s(s + 2):

18 = 1.6 s (s + 2)

Let me compute 1.6 s (s + 2):

= 1.6 (s^2 + 2s)

So, 18 = 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s

Let me bring everything to one side:

1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0

Hmm, dealing with decimals can be a bit messy. Maybe I can multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the decimal:

16 s^2 + 32 s - 180 = 0

Wait, 1.6 * 10 = 16, 3.2 *10=32, 18*10=180. So yes, that's correct.

Simplify the equation:

16 s^2 + 32 s - 180 = 0

Let me see if I can divide through by a common factor. Let's see, 16, 32, 180. All divisible by 4.

Divide each term by 4:

4 s^2 + 8 s - 45 = 0

So now, the quadratic equation is:

4 s^2 + 8 s - 45 = 0

I can try to solve this using the quadratic formula. For an equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the solutions are x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)]/(2a)

So, here a = 4, b = 8, c = -45.

Discriminant D = b^2 -4ac = 64 - 4*4*(-45) = 64 + 720 = 784

Square root of 784 is 28.

So, s = [-8 ± 28]/(2*4) = [ (-8 ±28) ] /8

So, two solutions:

s = (-8 +28)/8 = 20/8 = 2.5

s = (-8 -28)/8 = -36/8 = -4.5

Since speed can't be negative, s = 2.5 km/h.

So, s is 2.5 km/h. 

Now, let's substitute back to find C = t/60.

Using the first equation: 9/s + C =4

s=2.5, so 9/2.5 = 3.6

So, 3.6 + C =4

C=4 -3.6=0.4

C is 0.4 hours, which is t/60=0.4 => t=0.4*60=24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes.

Now, the problem asks: Suppose Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

So, her new speed is s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

So, the walking time is 9 km / 3 km/h = 3 hours.

Then, adding the coffee shop time, which is 24 minutes. 

Convert 3 hours to minutes: 3*60=180 minutes. Then, 180 +24=204 minutes.

Wait, that seems a bit straightforward. Let me double-check.

Wait, let me think again. The walk is 9 km at 3 km/h. Time is 9/3=3 hours. 3 hours is 180 minutes. Plus 24 minutes coffee shop: 180+24=204 minutes.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the answer should be 204 minutes.


To solve the problem, we start by setting up equations based on the given scenarios.

Let \( s \) be Aya's walking speed in km/h and \( t \) be the time spent in the coffee shop in minutes. The total time for each walk includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time.

### First Scenario:
- Speed: \( s \) km/h
- Total time: 4 hours (which is 240 minutes)
- Walking time: \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours
- Coffee shop time: \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours

The equation is:
\[
\frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]

### Second Scenario:
- Speed: \( s + 2 \) km/h
- Total time: 2 hours 24 minutes (which is 144 minutes)
- Walking time: \( \frac{9}{s + 2} \) hours
- Coffee shop time: \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours

The equation is:
\[
\frac{9}{s + 2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
\]

### Solving the Equations:
Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( \frac{t}{60} \):
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s + 2} = 4 - 2.4
\]
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s + 2} = 1.6
\]
Simplify:
\[
9 \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s + 2} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
9 \left( \frac{(s + 2) - s}{s(s + 2)} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
\frac{18}{s(s + 2)} = 1.6
\]
Multiply both sides by \( s(s + 2) \):
\[
18 = 1.6 s (s + 2)
\]
Simplify:
\[
18 = 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s
\]
\[
1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0
\]
Multiply through by 10 to eliminate decimals:
\[
16 s^2 + 32 s - 180 = 0
\]
Divide by 4:
\[
4 s^2 + 8 s - 45 = 0
\]
Solve using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
\[
s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{64 + 720}}{8} = \frac{-8 \pm 28}{8}
\]
\[
s = 2.5 \quad (\text{since speed cannot be negative})
\]

### Finding \( t \):
Substitute \( s = 2.5 \) into the first equation:
\[
\frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
3.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
\frac{t}{60} = 0.4 \implies t = 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

### New Speed and Total Time:
New speed: \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h
Walking time: \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) hours (180 minutes)
Total time including coffee shop: \( 180 + 24 = 204 \) minutes

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{204}
\]
