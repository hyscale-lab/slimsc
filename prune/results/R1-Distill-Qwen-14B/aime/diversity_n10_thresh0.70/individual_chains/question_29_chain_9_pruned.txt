Okay, I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again carefully.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given measurements are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, I should visualize the problem. Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, all their angles are right angles. Let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. Let's assume ABCD is the larger rectangle and EFGH is the smaller one attached in some way.

Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the points D and C are vertices of rectangle ABCD, and E and F are vertices of rectangle EFGH. So, the line passes through D, E, C, F.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting; these four points must be concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circumference. That suggests that the quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

Let me note down the given lengths:

- BC = 16. Since ABCD is a rectangle, BC is one of its sides. So, BC is the side opposite to AD. So, BC = AD = 16? Wait, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so AB = CD and BC = AD. So, BC = 16, which means AD = 16. Similarly, AB = 107, which means CD = 107.

Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, FG = 17 and EF = 184. So, EF is one side, FG is another. So, EF = 184, FG = 17, so the sides of EFGH are 184 and 17.

Wait, but wait, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so EF = GH = 184 and FG = EH = 17.

But I need to figure out how these rectangles are positioned. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, it's possible that EFGH is placed such that side EF is along the line DC, but I need to confirm.
