Alright, so I've got this problem with logarithms and three variables, x, y, and z. It's a system of equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of x^4 y^3 z^2. Then, express that as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and find m + n. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

The equations given are:

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

So, all of these are logarithms base 2. Since logarithms can be tricky, maybe I can rewrite each equation in exponential form to make it simpler. Remember, log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

Let's rewrite each equation:

1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)
2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)
3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)

Simplify the exponents:

1. sqrt(2) = x / (y z) → equation (1)
2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z) → equation (2)
3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y) → equation (3)

Hmm, now I have three equations with variables in the numerator and denominator. Maybe I can express x, y, z in terms of each other. Let me see.

From equation (1): x = sqrt(2) * y z.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z.

From equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y.

Hmm, substituting might get messy, but let's try to express everything in terms of one variable. Let's see if I can substitute x from equation (1) into equation (2), then into equation (3).

From equation (1), x = sqrt(2) y z. Let's plug this into equation (2):

y = 2^(1/3) * (sqrt(2) y z) * z = 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2) * y z^2.

Wait, so y = [2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2)] y z^2.

Simplify the exponents: 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6). So,

y = 2^(5/6) y z^2.

Hmm, I can divide both sides by y (since y is positive, so it's not zero):

1 = 2^(5/6) z^2.

So, z^2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6).

Taking square roots:

z = 2^(-5/12). Because sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we take the positive root.

Okay, so z is 2^(-5/12). Let me note that down.

Now, let's go back to equation (1): x = sqrt(2) * y z.

We have z = 2^(-5/12), so let's plug that in:

x = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 - 5/12).

Compute the exponent: 1/2 is 6/12, so 6/12 -5/12 = 1/12.

So, x = y * 2^(1/12). So, x = y * 2^(1/12). Let's keep that in mind.

Now, let's go to equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z.

We already have x in terms of y, so substitute x:

y = 2^(1/3) * (y * 2^(1/12)) * z.

We also know z is 2^(-5/12), so plug that in:

y = 2^(1/3) * y * 2^(1/12) * 2^(-5/12).

Combine the exponents:

2^(1/3) * 2^(1/12 -5/12) = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-4/12) = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-1/3) = 2^(0) = 1.

So, y = 1 * y → y = y.

Wait, that just gives an identity. Hmm, that doesn't help me find y. Maybe I need to try a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can express all variables in terms of each other and then set up a system.

We have:

From equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) y z → equation (1a)

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) x z → equation (2a)

From equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) x y → equation (3a)

Let me substitute equation (1a) into equation (2a):

y = 2^(1/3) * (2^(1/2) y z) * z = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) y z^2.

Which is similar to what I did earlier, leading to z^2 = 2^(-5/6), so z=2^(-5/12). So, maybe I can then substitute z into equation (3a) to find x and y.

Wait, equation (3a) is z = 2^(1/4) x y. We know z is 2^(-5/12), so:

2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) x y.

Let me compute 2^(1/4) as 2^(3/12), and 2^(-5/12) is as is. So,

x y = [2^(-5/12)] / [2^(3/12)] = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3).

So, x y = 2^(-2/3). Equation (4).

From equation (1a): x = 2^(1/2) y z.

We know z is 2^(-5/12), so x = 2^(1/2) y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 -5/12).

Compute 1/2 as 6/12, so 6/12 -5/12 =1/12.

Thus, x = y * 2^(1/12). So, x = y * 2^(1/12). Equation (5).

Now, plug equation (5) into equation (4):

x y = (y * 2^(1/12)) * y = y^2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3).

So,

y^2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 -1/12).

Convert to common denominator:

-2/3 = -8/12, so -8/12 -1/12 = -9/12 = -3/4.

Therefore, y^2 = 2^(-3/4).

Taking square roots, y = 2^(-3/8). Since y is positive.

Now, from equation (5): x = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12).

Add the exponents: -3/8 + 1/12.

Find a common denominator, which is 24:

-3/8 = -9/24, 1/12 = 2/24. So, -9/24 + 2/24 = -7/24.

So, x = 2^(-7/24).

Now, we have x, y, z in terms of exponents of 2.

x = 2^(-7/24),
y = 2^(-3/8),
z = 2^(-5/12).

Let me double-check these to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, check equation (1): log₂(x/(y z)).

Compute x/(y z):

x = 2^(-7/24),
y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24),
z = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24).

So, y*z = 2^(-9/24 + -10/24) = 2^(-19/24).

Then, x/(y z) = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(-19/24) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2), which is sqrt(2). So log₂(sqrt(2)) is 1/2. Correct.

Good, equation (1) checks out.

Equation (2): log₂(y/(x z)).

Compute y/(x z):

y = 2^(-9/24),
x*z = 2^(-7/24 + -10/24) = 2^(-17/24).

So, y/(x z) = 2^(-9/24) / 2^(-17/24) = 2^(8/24) = 2^(1/3). So log₂(2^(1/3)) is 1/3. Correct.

Equation (3): log₂(z/(x y)).

Compute z/(x y):

z =2^(-10/24),
x*y = 2^(-7/24 + -9/24)=2^(-16/24)=2^(-2/3).

So, z/(x y)=2^(-10/24)/2^(-16/24)=2^(6/24)=2^(1/4). Log₂(2^(1/4))=1/4. Correct.

All equations check out. Great, so the values of x, y, z are correct.

Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

Let's compute log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2).

Since logarithms turn products into sums and exponents into multipliers:

log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 log₂x + 3 log₂ y + 2 log₂ z.

We have x =2^(-7/24), so log₂x = -7/24.

Similarly, y =2^(-3/8)=2^(-9/24), so log₂y = -9/24.

z=2^(-5/12)=2^(-10/24), so log₂z= -10/24.

Plug these into the expression:

4*(-7/24) + 3*(-9/24) + 2*(-10/24).

Compute each term:

4*(-7/24)= -28/24,
3*(-9/24)= -27/24,
2*(-10/24)= -20/24.

Sum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24.

So, log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -75/24.

Absolute value: | -75/24 | = 75/24.

Simplify 75/24: both divisible by 3.

75 ÷3=25, 24 ÷3=8. So, 25/8.

So, the value is 25/8. Therefore, m=25, n=8. They are coprime since 25 and 8 have no common factors besides 1.

So, m + n =25 +8=33.


The given system of equations is:

\[
\begin{cases}
\log_2\left(\dfrac{x}{yz}\right) = \dfrac{1}{2} \\
\log_2\left(\dfrac{y}{xz}\right) = \dfrac{1}{3} \\
\log_2\left(\dfrac{z}{xy}\right) = \dfrac{1}{4}
\end{cases}
\]

Rewriting each equation in exponential form:

\[
\begin{cases}
\dfrac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} \\
\dfrac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3} \\
\dfrac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}
\end{cases}
\]

Expressing \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other:

1. \(x = 2^{1/2} yz\)
2. \(y = 2^{1/3} xz\)
3. \(z = 2^{1/4} xy\)

Substituting \(x\) from equation (1) into equation (2):

\[
y = 2^{1/3} (2^{1/2} yz) z = 2^{5/6} y z^2
\]

Solving for \(z\):

\[
1 = 2^{5/6} z^2 \implies z^2 = 2^{-5/6} \implies z = 2^{-5/12}
\]

Substituting \(z\) back into equation (1):

\[
x = 2^{1/2} y \cdot 2^{-5/12} = y \cdot 2^{1/12}
\]

Substituting \(x\) and \(z\) into equation (3):

\[
2^{-5/12} = 2^{1/4} (y \cdot 2^{1/12}) y \implies y^2 = 2^{-2/3} \implies y = 2^{-3/8}
\]

Finally, substituting \(y\) into \(x = y \cdot 2^{1/12}\):

\[
x = 2^{-3/8} \cdot 2^{1/12} = 2^{-7/24}
\]

Thus, \(x = 2^{-7/24}\), \(y = 2^{-3/8}\), and \(z = 2^{-5/12}\).

Now, compute \(\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\):

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4\log_2 x + 3\log_2 y + 2\log_2 z
\]

Substituting the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):

\[
4(-7/24) + 3(-9/24) + 2(-10/24) = \dfrac{-28 - 27 - 20}{24} = \dfrac{-75}{24}
\]

Taking the absolute value:

\[
\left|\dfrac{-75}{24}\right| = \dfrac{75}{24} = \dfrac{25}{8}
\]

Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), so \(m + n = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
