Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x².

Now, we have four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at (0,0). Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, I think. Or wait, no—rhombus diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: In a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, hold on. No, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yeah, I remember now. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's an important property.

So, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and they're perpendicular, the four points A, B, C, D must be arranged such that the diagonals cross at the origin. So, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal.

Since diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D must be (-p, -q). Because the midpoint of AC is ((x + (-x))/2, (y + (-y))/2) = (0,0), same for BD.

But all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, plugging in A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Similarly for B: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

So, we have two points, A and B, on the hyperbola, and C and D are just the reflections of A and B through the origin, respectively.

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal in length. So, the lengths AB, BC, CD, DA must be equal. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, another approach is to use the properties of the rhombus in terms of the diagonals.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to parameterize points A and B on the hyperbola and then enforce the rhombus condition.

Let me think. Let’s say point A is (x, y) on the hyperbola, so x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Then,
