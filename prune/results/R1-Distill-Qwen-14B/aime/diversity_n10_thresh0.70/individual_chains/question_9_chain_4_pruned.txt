Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, let's write down the given equations. The first one is log_x(y^x) = 10. The second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. So, both of these logarithmic expressions equal 10. I remember some logarithm rules, so maybe I can simplify these expressions first.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the logarithm power rule, which says that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a), I can bring the exponent x down. So this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Let me write that down:

Equation 1: x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, looking at the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, applying the same power rule, that becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. So, Equation 2: 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Hmm, okay. Now, I know that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). That's the reciprocal property of logarithms. So, log_x(y) is 1 / log_y(x). Let me set a variable to make this easier. Let's let t = log_y(x). Then, log_x(y) would be 1/t.

Substituting into Equation 1: x * (1/t) = 10. So, x = 10t.

Similarly, Equation 2: 4y * t = 10. So, 4y t = 10. I can solve for y here. Let's rearrange that: y = 10 / (4t) = (5)/(2t).

So now I have expressions for x and y in terms of t: x = 10t and y = 5/(2t). But since x and y are both greater than 1, I should note that t must be positive because logarithms are defined only for positive numbers, and since x and y are greater than 1, their logs are positive.

Now, I need another equation that relates x and y to find the value of t. Since I have expressions for x and y in terms of t, perhaps I can substitute one into the other or find a relationship between them.

Wait a second, remember that t = log_y(x). Let's write that down: t = log_y(x). Using the change of base formula, this is equal to (ln x)/(ln y). Alternatively, since t = log_y(x), we can write this as x = y^t. Because if log_y(x) = t, then y^t = x.

So, x = y^t. But from earlier, x = 10t and y = 5/(2t). So substituting y into x = y^t gives:

x = [5/(2t)]^t.

But x is also equal to 10t, so:

10t = [5/(2t)]^t.

Hmm, that's an equation in terms of t. Let me write that again:

10t = (5/(2t))^t.

This looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify. Let's do that.

Taking ln on both sides:

ln(10t) = ln[(5/(2t))^t].

Using the power rule for logarithms on the right side, that becomes:

ln(10t) = t * ln(5/(2t)).

So now, I have:

ln(10t) = t * [ln(5) - ln(2t)].

Let me expand that right side:

ln(10t) = t ln(5) - t ln(2t).

Now, ln(2t) can be written as ln(2) + ln(t). So:

ln(10t) = t ln(5) - t [ln(2) + ln(t)].

Expanding further:

ln(10t) = t ln(5) - t ln(2) - t ln(t).

Now, let's write the left side as ln(10) + ln(t):

ln(10) + ln(t) = t ln(5) - t ln(2) - t ln(t).

Let me collect like terms. Bring all terms to one side:

ln(10) + ln(t) - t ln(5) + t ln(2) + t ln(t) = 0.

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe factor out the t terms:

ln(10) + ln(t) + t [ -ln(5) + ln(2) + ln(t) ] = 0.

Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange terms:

ln(10) + ln(t) = t ln(5) - t ln(2) - t ln(t).

Which can be written as:

ln(10) + ln(t) = t [ ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(t) ].

Hmm, that still looks complicated. Perhaps I should try to see if I can find an integer value of t that satisfies this equation, or find a substitution.

Wait, let's make a substitution. Let me let u = ln(t). Then, ln(t) = u, so t = e^u.

Substituting into the equation:

ln(10) + u = e^u [ ln(5) - ln(2) - u ].

This equation is:

ln(10) + u = e^u (ln(5/2) - u).

Hmm, still complicated, but maybe trying small integer values for u could help. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps t is a rational number, maybe 2? Let's test t=2.

If t=2, then x =10*2=20, y=5/(2*2)=5/4=1.25. Are both x and y greater than 1
