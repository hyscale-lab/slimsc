Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the greatest four-digit number N with a specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient when N is divided by 1000 and R is the remainder. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's take it step by step.

First, let me parse the problem. N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is ABCD, then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, which must be divisible by 7. Similarly, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, which must also be divisible by 7, and so on for C and D.

Since N is the greatest such four-digit number, I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find a number that satisfies the condition. But that seems time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about the structure of N. Let's denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. The problem states that changing any one digit to 1 must result in a number divisible by 7. So, let's analyze each possibility.

1. Changing A to 1: The number becomes 1BCD. So, 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7.
2. Changing B to 1: The number becomes A1CD. So, A1CD ≡ 0 mod 7.
3. Changing C to 1: The number becomes AB1D. So, AB1D ≡ 0 mod 7.
4. Changing D to 1: The number becomes ABC1. So, ABC1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

I need each of these four numbers to be divisible by 7. So, for each digit position, when it's replaced by 1, the resulting number is a multiple of 7.

Hmm, perhaps I can represent N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. Then, replacing each digit with 1 gives four different expressions:

1. Replacing A: 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod7
2. Replacing B: 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod7
3. Replacing C: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D ≡ 0 mod7
4. Replacing D: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod7

Wait, maybe I can write these as congruences modulo 7.

Let me compute 1000 mod7, 100 mod7, 10 mod7, and 1 mod7, because these can help simplify the expressions.

Calculating:

1000 ÷7: 7*142=994, so 1000-994=6 → 1000 ≡6 mod7.

100 ÷7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2 → 100≡2 mod7.

10 ÷7: 10-7=3 →10≡3 mod7.

1≡1 mod7.

So substituting back into the four cases:

1. Replacing A: 6*(1) + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7 → 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

2. Replacing B: (6A) + 2*(1) + 3C + D ≡0 mod7 →6A + 2 +3C + D ≡0 mod7.

3. Replacing C:6A +2B +3*(1) + D ≡0 mod7 →6A +2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7.

4. Replacing D:6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7 →6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

So now I have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7 ...(1)

2. 6A + 2 +3C + D ≡0 mod7 ...(2)

3.6A +2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7 ...(3)

4.6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7 ...(4)

Hmm, okay, let me see if I can combine these equations to find relationships between A, B, C, D.

Let me denote equation (4) as:

6A + 2B + 3C ≡ -1 mod7 ...(4a)

And the other equations can be expressed in terms of each other.

Looking at equation (1):

6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7 → 2B +3C + D ≡-6 ≡1 mod7 ...(1a)

Equation (2):

6A + 2 +3C + D ≡0 mod7 →6A +3C + D ≡-2 ≡5 mod7 ...(2a)

Equation (3):

6A +2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7 →6A +2B + D ≡-3 ≡4 mod7 ...(3a)

So now, equations (1a), (2a), (3a), (4a):

1a: 2B + 3C + D ≡1

2a:6A +3C + D ≡5

3a:6A +2B + D ≡4

4a:6A +2B +3C ≡-1 ≡6 mod7

Hmm, perhaps I can subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

Let me subtract 1a from 2a:

(6A +3C + D) - (2B +3C + D) = 6A -2B ≡5 -1 →6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Simplify: 6A -2B ≡4 mod7. Let me factor 2: 2*(3A - B) ≡4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, the inverse of 2 mod7 is 4 because 2*4=8≡1 mod7). So multiplying both sides by 4:

(3A - B) ≡4*4=16≡2 mod7.

So, 3A - B ≡2 mod7 ...(5)

That's one equation.

Similarly, subtract 1a from 3a:

(6A +2B + D) - (2B +3C + D) =6A -3C ≡4 -1=3 mod7.

So,6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

Factor 3: 3*(2A - C) ≡3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime, inverse of 3 is 5 because 3*5=15≡1 mod7):

2A - C ≡1 mod7 ...(6)

Another equation.

Now, from equation (4a):6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

We can maybe express 6A +2B +3C in terms of other variables.

Alternatively, perhaps express variables in terms of each other.

From equation (5):3A - B ≡2 → B ≡3A -2 mod7.

From equation (6):2A - C ≡1 → C ≡2A -1 mod7.

Let me substitute B and C into other equations.

Starting with equation (1a):

2B +3C + D ≡1.

Substituting B=3A-2, C=2A-1:

2*(3A -2) +3*(2A -1) + D ≡1 →6A -4 +6A -3 + D ≡1 →12A -7 + D ≡1.

Since we're mod7, 12A ≡5A (because 12 mod7 is 5), and -7≡0 mod7. So 5A + D ≡1 mod7 ...(7)

Similarly, equation (2a):6A +3C + D ≡5.

Substituting C=2A -1:

6A +3*(2A -1) + D ≡5 →6A +6A -3 + D ≡5 →12A -3 + D ≡5.

Again, mod7:12A≡5A, -3≡4, so 5A + D ≡5 +4=9≡2 mod7.

So 5A + D ≡2 mod7 ...(8)

Wait, but equation (7) says 5A + D ≡1 mod7, and equation (8) says 5A + D ≡2 mod7. That's a problem because 1 ≡2 mod7 is not possible. So this suggests that I have a contradiction.

Hmm, did I make a mistake in substitution somewhere? Let's double-check the steps.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the substitution in equation (2a). Let me recount.

Equation (2a):6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7.

C=2A -1 mod7, so 3C=3*(2A -1)=6A -3.

So
