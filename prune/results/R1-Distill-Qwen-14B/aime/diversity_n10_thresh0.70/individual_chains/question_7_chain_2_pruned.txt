Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, so that's a 50-50 chance for each color. The question is about finding the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

First, let me try to understand the problem. We've got a regular octagon, which means all sides and angles are equal. Each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a probability of 1/2, independently. So the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256.

Now, the key part is figuring out when the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. So, essentially, after rotation, the set of blue vertices should coincide with the set of red vertices in the original coloring. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. Let me read that again. "All of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, in other words, after rotation, every blue vertex is now in a position that was previously red. Hmm. So, that means that the set of blue vertices, when rotated, must exactly match the set of red vertices. Alternatively, the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of colorings. Let me formalize this.

Let’s denote the original coloring as a function C: V → {R, B}, where V is the set of vertices. After a rotation by k positions (where k can be 0, 1, 2, ..., 7), each vertex i moves to position (i + k) mod 8. We want that for some rotation k, the image of the blue vertices under this rotation is exactly the set of red vertices in the original coloring.

Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. The problem says that after rotation, all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. So, for each blue vertex in the original coloring, after rotation, it moves to a position that was red. So, for each blue vertex in the original, its image under rotation is a red vertex in the original. But since
