Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the problem carefully and understanding what it's asking.

The problem says that every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and then stops at a coffee shop. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Then, when she walks at s + 2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same t minutes in the coffee shop.

Now, the question is asking me to find the number of minutes the walk takes her when she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the t minutes at the coffee shop.

Hmm, okay. So the key here is to find out how long her walk takes at this new speed, s + 1/2. But to do that, I think I need to first figure out what s and t are. Because the problem gives me two different scenarios with two different speeds and the time taken, including the coffee shop time.

Let me write down the given information:

1. When speed = s km/h, time taken including coffee shop = 4 hours. So, the total time is 4 hours, which includes both walking and the coffee shop time t minutes.
2. When speed = (s + 2) km/h, time taken including coffee shop = 2 hours and 24 minutes. Again, total time includes walking and coffee shop.

And we know the distance is 9 km in both cases, right? Because it's the same walk every morning.

So, first, I can write equations based on the distance formula. Distance equals speed multiplied by time. But wait, time in the problem is given in different units. The first scenario is 4 hours, and the second is 2 hours and 24 minutes. I think I should convert all times into the same unit, maybe minutes, to make it easier.

Wait, but let's see: the time includes the coffee shop time. So, the total time is the walking time plus t minutes. So, the walking time alone is total time minus t.

Wait, but in the problem, both scenarios include t minutes in the coffee shop. So, for each scenario, the time given is the total time from start to finish, including the coffee stop. So, the walking time would be the total time minus t.

But I don't know t yet. So, I need to set up equations that relate s and t.

Let me write this formally.

Let me denote:

- When speed = s km/h, total time (including coffee shop) = 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

- When speed = s + 2 km/h, total time (including coffee shop) = 2 hours 24 minutes = (2 * 60) + 24 = 120 + 24 = 144 minutes.

So, in each case, the time spent walking plus t minutes equals the total time.

Let me denote T1 as the total time for the first scenario: T1 = 4 hours = 240 minutes
