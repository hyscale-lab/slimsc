Okay, let me try to solve this geometry problem. Hmm, we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, let me sketch a rough diagram in my mind. So, we have rectangle ABCD. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, AB is 107, BC is 16, which means CD is 107 and DA is 16. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides FG=17 and EF=184, so GH=17 and HE=184.

Now, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the points D, E, C, F lie on a straight line. Let me think about their positions. Since ABCD is a rectangle, D is one of its vertices. Similarly, E is a vertex of EFGH. So, the line DC (or CF) passes through E and F.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That suggests that these four points are concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circumference. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

I need to find CE. Let's see. CE is a segment on the line DC, between points C and E. Since E is between D and C (I think), but I need to confirm that.

Wait, the order of the points is D, E, C, F collinear. So, starting from D, then E, then C, then F. So, D-E-C-F are in a straight line. So, the order is D, E, C, F. So, E is between D and C, and F is after C.

Wait, but D is a vertex of rectangle ABCD. Let me think about the positions. Let me consider ABCD with A at the origin for simplicity. Let me assign coordinates to these points.

Let me place rectangle ABCD with point A at (0, 0). Then, since AB is 107, point B will be at (107, 0). BC is 16, so point C is at (107, 16). Then, point D is at (0, 16). Because in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and right angles.

Now, rectangle EFGH. Let me figure out where E, F, G, H are. Since EFGH is a rectangle, and we have EF=184, FG=17. So, EF is the length of the side, and FG is the height.

But wait, in the problem, it says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the points D(0,16), E, C(107,16), F are on a straight line. So, these points lie on the line y=16. Because D is at (0,1
