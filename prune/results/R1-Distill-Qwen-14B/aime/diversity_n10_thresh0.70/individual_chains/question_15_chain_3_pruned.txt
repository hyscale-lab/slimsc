Okay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and each path has a length of 16. That makes sense because an 8x8 grid has 8 horizontal and 8 vertical lines, so moving from one corner to the opposite would require moving 8 right and 8 up steps, totaling 16 steps.

The problem specifically asks for the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times. Hmm, changing directionâ€”so that would mean going from moving right to up, or up to right, each time. Each time the direction changes, it's a switch from one movement to the other.

Let me try to visualize this. If a path doesn't change direction at all, it would be just moving straight right 8 times and then straight up 8 times. But that's the extreme case. If it changes direction once, it would go right for a bit, then up, then right again, but wait, no, if it changes direction once, it can only switch once from right to up or up to right. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, actually, each path is a sequence of moves, either right or up. So each change in direction is when the direction switches. For example, if a path goes right, right, up, up, right, right, etc., each time the direction changes, it's a new segment. So if a path changes direction four times, that means it has five segments. Because each change adds a new segment.

Let me clarify: starting direction is either right or up. But in an 8x8 grid, to reach the upper right corner, you need to make exactly 8 right moves and 8 up moves. So the path must consist of a sequence of right and up moves, adding up to 16 in total.

Wait, but in terms of direction changes, each time the direction switches, that's a new segment. So if a path has four direction changes, that would mean it has five segments. Let's say, for example, right, up, right, up, right. That's four changes and five segments.

So to model this, each path with four direction changes has five segments, alternating between right and up. The number of direction changes is four, so the path has five segments. Since it starts either with right or up, the number of segments of each direction will vary.

Wait, let's
