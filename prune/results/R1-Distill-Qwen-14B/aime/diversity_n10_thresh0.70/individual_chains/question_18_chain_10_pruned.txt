Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. A dodecagon has 12 sides, right? And the rectangles are formed such that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting.

First, I need to visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees because the formula for each internal angle is ((n-2)*180)/n, which for n=12 gives (10*180)/12 = 150 degrees.

Now, the problem is about rectangles. So, how do rectangles form inside a dodecagon? Well, in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, you can often find rectangles by connecting certain vertices. But in a dodecagon, which has 12 sides, which is an even number, but not a multiple of 4, right?

Wait, 12 is a multiple of 4, because 12 divided by 4 is 3. So maybe that helps. But I'm not sure yet. Let me think.

In regular polygons, the sides and diagonals can form various shapes, including rectangles, if the opposite sides are equal and the angles are 90 degrees. So, for a rectangle to exist, we need four points (vertices of the dodecagon) such that the lines connecting them form right angles.

But how do we ensure that the sides are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon? Hmm. So, each side of the rectangle must lie on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, which means that the sides of the rectangle correspond to edges or diagonals of the dodecagon.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides are all the same length, but the diagonals can be of different lengths, depending on how many vertices they skip. For example, a diagonal connecting two vertices with one vertex in between is shorter than one that connects vertices with two vertices in between, and so on.

So, perhaps the rectangles can be formed by selecting pairs of parallel sides or diagonals. Because in a regular polygon, certain sides and diagonals are parallel.

But wait, in a regular dodecagon, each side is parallel to the side three positions away, right? Because 12 is divisible by 4, so stepping three positions (12/4=3) would give a parallel side. Similarly, diagonals can be parallel if they connect vertices with the same step apart.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of vectors or coordinate systems.

Let me imagine the regular dodecagon inscribed in a unit circle. Each vertex can be represented as a point on the circumference, with angles at intervals of 30 degrees (since 360/12=30). So, the coordinates of each vertex can be given by (cos θ, sin θ), where θ is 0°, 30°, 60°, ..., 330°.

If I can find four such points that form a rectangle, then each side of the rectangle must lie on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangle must be either edges of the dodecagon or diagonals connecting two non-consecutive vertices.

Wait, but in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, for four points A, B, C, D to form a rectangle, the vectors AB and AD must be perpendicular, and their lengths must satisfy the rectangle's properties.

Alternatively, thinking about the symmetry, the dodecagon has rotational symmetry of order 12 and reflectional symmetry across multiple axes. So, any rectangle found in one position can be rotated to another position, leading to multiple rectangles.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, sides are parallel if they are separated by a certain number of
