Alright, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to parse it carefully.

Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. So, S has 10 numbers in total, and she selects 4 unique ones. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S as well. 

The problem states that she wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. And she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the four randomly chosen ones. 

We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem. The probability will be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then we have to find m + n.

Okay, so first, let me recall the formula for conditional probability. The probability of event A given event B is P(A ∩ B) / P(B). But in this case, if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize, so A is a subset of B. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute two probabilities: the probability that Jen wins the grand prize (which is the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen), and the probability that she wins at least two numbers (which is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen). Then, divide the grand prize probability by the prize probability.

Let me structure this:

1. Calculate the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10. That's the denominator for all probabilities. Let's denote this as C(10,4), where C(n,k) is the combination formula.

2. Calculate the number of favorable outcomes for the grand prize: this is when all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. Since she picks exactly four numbers, there's only one way this can happen because the lottery also picks four numbers. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1. Therefore, the probability P(A) is 1 / C(10,4).

3. Now, calculate the probability that she wins a prize, which is when at least two of her numbers are chosen. This can be broken down into the cases where exactly two are chosen, exactly three are chosen, or exactly four are chosen. So, P(B) is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios.

Alternatively, it's sometimes easier to calculate the complement probability and subtract from 1. The complement of winning at least two is winning fewer than two, i.e., winning zero or one numbers. So, the probability of winning a prize is 1 minus the probability of having zero or one numbers chosen.

Let me compute both approaches and see which is easier.

First, let's compute P(B) using the complement method.

Total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4) = 210.

The number of ways where none of Jen's numbers are chosen: since Jen picked 4 numbers, there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers she didn't pick. The lottery picks 4 numbers, so the number of ways to choose all 4 from the 6 non-Jen numbers is C(6,4).

Similarly, the number of ways where exactly one of Jen's numbers is chosen: we choose 1 number from her 4, and the remaining 3 from the 6 non-Jen numbers. So that's C(4,1)*C(6,3).

So, total number of ways to have zero or one match is C(6,4) + C(4,1)*C(6,3).

Let me compute these:

C(6,4) = 15.

C(4,1) = 4, and C(6,3) = 20. So, 4*20 = 80.

Adding these together: 15 + 80 = 95.

Therefore, the number of ways where she has at least two matches is total ways minus this, so 210 - 95 = 115.

Hence, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Alternatively, if I compute it by adding the cases for exactly two, three, and four matches, I should get the same result. Let's check for confirmation.

Number of ways for exactly two matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2). C(4,2)=6, C(6,2)=15. So 6*15=90.

Number of ways for exactly three matches: C(4,3)*
