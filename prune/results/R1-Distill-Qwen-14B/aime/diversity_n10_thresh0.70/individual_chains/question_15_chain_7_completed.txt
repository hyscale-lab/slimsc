Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I remember that in grid paths, moving from one corner to the opposite, you usually move right (R) and up (U). For an 8x8 grid, you need to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, so the total number of steps is 16. The number of such paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But here, we have a restriction: the path must change direction exactly four times.

Wait, what does changing direction mean? In grid paths, each change in direction is when you switch from moving right to up or vice versa. Each time you switch direction, that's one change. So, for example, if you start by moving right, then up, then right, that's two changes.

So, how does the number of direction changes relate to the number of runs? A "run" is a consecutive sequence of the same move. For example, RRRUUURRR has three runs: RRR, UUU, RRR. Each time the direction changes, a new run starts. So, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs.

Wait, let me think. If you have a path with k runs, then there are (k-1) direction changes. Because each run after the first one is preceded by a direction change. So, for four direction changes, the number of runs would be five. Because 4 changes +1 =5 runs.

So, we need paths with exactly five runs. Each run is a consecutive sequence of rights or ups.

But we need to figure out how these runs are arranged. Each run must be at least one step, right? Because you can't have a run of zero steps.

So, the path will be a sequence of right and up runs, each at least one step, with 5 runs in total, and the sum of the right steps is 8, and the sum of the up steps is also 8.

Wait, since the grid is 8x8, we have 8 right moves and 8 up moves. So, the total number of right runs and up runs must sum to 8 in each direction.

Wait, but the runs alternate between right and up. So, the number of right runs and up runs depends on whether the first run is right or up.

So, considering that, the number of runs can be either even or odd, but since we have five runs, which is odd, the number of right runs and up runs will differ by one.

Because in an alternating sequence, starting with R, you have R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs. Alternatively, starting with U, you have U, R, U, R, U, which would be three U runs and two R runs. So, depending on the starting direction, the number of runs splits into (3,2) or (2,3).

Wait, but since the total steps for each direction are both 8, we need to split 8 into either 3 R runs and 2 U runs, or 2 R runs and 3 U runs. Let me think.

Wait, no. Let's clarify: the total number of runs is 5, which is odd. So, one direction will have (5+1)/2 = 3 runs, and the other will have (5-1)/2 = 2 runs.

So, if the path starts with R, then the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs. Similarly, if it starts with U, it's U, R, U, R, U, so three U runs and two R runs.

Therefore, the problem can be split into two cases: paths starting with R and paths starting with U. Each case has a different distribution of runs.

So, I'll need to calculate the number of paths for each case and then add them together.

Let me formalize this. For the case starting with R:

Number of R runs: 3
Number of U runs: 2

Each R run has at least 1 step, and similarly for U runs. So, the total number of R steps is 8, split into 3 runs. Similarly, U steps are 8, split into 2 runs.

The number of ways to split 8 R steps into 3 runs is the number of positive integer solutions to x1 + x2 + x3 = 8. That's C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21. Similarly, for U steps, splitting 8 into 2 runs: C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) = 7.

But wait, each run must be at least 1, so the number is (8-1 choose 3-1) = 21 for R and (8-1 choose 2-1) =7 for U.

So, the number of such paths starting with R is 21 * 7 = 147.

Similarly, for the case starting with U:

Number of U runs:3
Number of R runs:2

So, the number of ways to split 8 U steps into 3 runs is C(7,2)=21, and for R steps, it's C(7,1)=7.

So, the number of such paths starting with U is 21 *7=147.

Therefore, the total number of paths is 147 +147=294.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have missed something. Because the runs are ordered. So, each run is a consecutive same direction step.

But in the calculation, when I split the R steps into 3 runs, and U steps into 2 runs, the order is determined by the starting direction.

But are those the only possibilities? Or is there a need to consider different arrangements?

Wait, no, because once the starting direction is fixed, the number of runs for R and U is determined. For example, starting with R, the runs are R, U, R, U, R, so three R runs and two U runs.

Similarly, starting with U, it's U, R, U, R, U, so three U runs and two R runs.

So, each case is separate, and the number of paths in each case is 147, so together 294.

Wait, but wait another thought. Maybe I should also consider the direction changes. Because each direction change is required to happen exactly four times.

Wait, earlier, I thought that four direction changes correspond to five runs. So, that part seems correct. Each direction change is a switch between R and U, so each time you switch, that's a change.

So, five runs imply four direction changes, which is what the problem requires.

Therefore, the total number of such paths is 294.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes in combinatorics, it's easy to miss a factor or miscount.

So, let me think again. The number of paths starting with R is determined by the number of ways to split R into 3 runs and U into 2 runs. Each split is independent, so the number of such paths is (number of R splits) multiplied by (number of U splits).

Similarly for starting with U.

So, for starting with R:

R runs: 3, each at least 1 step. So, the number is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21.

U runs: 2, each at least 1 step. So, C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

So, number of such paths is 21*7=147.

Same for starting with U: 21 *7=147.

Total: 147*2=294.

So, that seems correct.

Wait, but let me make sure that each run is correctly considered. Because in the grid, each run is a consecutive steps in the same direction. So, for example, for the starting with R case, the path would look like R... U... R... U... R..., where each ... represents a certain number of steps.

So, the number of such paths is the number of ways to assign the lengths of each run, which are positive integers that sum to 8 for R and 8 for U, as I did earlier.

So, yes, the calculation seems correct.

Therefore, the answer is 294.

But wait, another thought. Since the grid is 8x8, does the starting point matter? Like, does the direction of the first step affect the count? Or is it symmetric?

Well, since the grid is square, 8x8, the number of paths starting with R and the number starting with U should be the same.

Which they are, 147 each, so total 294.

So, I think that should be the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we need to count the number of paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner of an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of 16 steps, with 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U). 

A direction change occurs when the path switches from R to U or vice versa. Exactly four direction changes imply the path consists of five runs (consecutive steps in the same direction). These runs alternate between R and U, starting with either R or U.

### Case 1: Path starts with R
- **Runs**: R, U, R, U, R (3 R runs and 2 U runs)
- **Splitting steps**:
  - R steps (8) into 3 runs: \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \)
  - U steps (8) into 2 runs: \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \)
- **Number of paths**: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \)

### Case 2: Path starts with U
- **Runs**: U, R, U, R, U (3 U runs and 2 R runs)
- **Splitting steps**:
  - U steps (8) into 3 runs: \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \)
  - R steps (8) into 2 runs: \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \)
- **Number of paths**: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \)

### Total Paths
Adding the paths from both cases:
\[ 147 + 147 = 294 \]

**Answer**: \boxed{294}
