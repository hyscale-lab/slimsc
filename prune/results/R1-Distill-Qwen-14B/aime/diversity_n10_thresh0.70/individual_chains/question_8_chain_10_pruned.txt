Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.

First, let me write down what I know. The first equation is straightforward: the sum of a, b, and c is 300. The second equation involves their squares and cross terms. Maybe I can factor or simplify the second equation somehow.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Hmm, I notice that each term is a product of two different variables, where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this expression.

Let me factor out common terms. For example, a²b + a²c can be written as a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c can be written as b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b as c²(a + b). So putting it all together, the second equation becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, interesting. Now, since I know that a + b + c = 300, maybe I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). Let me try that.

So substituting, the equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me expand each term. For example, a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³. Similarly for the others. So the entire equation becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

I can factor out the 300 from the squared terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that looks a bit better. Let me write that as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Maybe I can find another relation involving a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³. I know that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c = 300, this would give:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)
90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)

So, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca). Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc. Maybe I can express other terms in terms of S, Q, P.

Wait, I also know that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed in terms of S, Q, and P. The formula is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3S Q + 3P.

Let me verify that. Yes, the identity is:

a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ca).

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 3abc + (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ca).

Wait, maybe I should write it as:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Yes, that's correct. So, a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3 S Q + 3 P.

Given that S = 300, so S³ = 27,000,000. So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 3*300*Q + 3P
= 27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3P.

So going back to the equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Substituting a² + b² + c² as 90,000 - 2Q, and a³ + b³ + c³ as 27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3P, we get:

300*(90,000 - 2Q) - [27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3P] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 300*90,000 - 300*2Q = 27,000,000 - 600 Q.

Then, subtracting [27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3P], so:

27,000,000 - 600 Q - 27,000,000 + 900 Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

Simplify the terms:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.

-600 Q + 900 Q = 300 Q.

And then -3P.

So overall, 300 Q - 3 P = 6,000,000.

Let me divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

100 Q - P = 2,000,000.

So, 100 Q - P = 2,000,000.

Or, P = 100 Q - 2,000,000.

Hmm, that gives a relation between P and Q. Now, I need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers with a + b + c = 300 and this relation between Q and P.

But I'm not sure how to connect this yet. Let me think about other relations or constraints.

Wait, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, maybe I can consider symmetric functions or perhaps use the fact that the variables are interchangeable. Maybe I can assume an order, like a ≤ b ≤ c, to reduce the number of cases. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider variables as x, y, z where x = a, y = b, z = c, but that might not help directly.

Wait, perhaps I can express everything in terms of Q.

From the equation, P = 100 Q - 2,000,000.

But I also know that for three variables, the relation between S, Q, and P is given by the cubic equation:

t^3 - S t^2 + Q t - P = 0.

So, substituting S = 300, Q = Q, P = 100 Q - 2,000,000, the equation becomes:

t^3 - 300 t^2 + Q t - (100 Q - 2,000,000) = 0.

Simplify this:

t^3 - 300 t^2 + Q t - 100 Q + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but perhaps I can factor out Q:

t^3 - 300 t^2 + Q(t - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Not sure if that helps. Maybe I can rearrange terms:

t^3 - 300 t^2 + 2,000,000 = - Q(t - 100).

But I don't see an immediate way forward with that.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the possible values of Q. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding up to 300, what's the maximum and minimum of Q?

The maximum of Q occurs when two variables are as large as possible, and the third is as small as possible. For example, when a = b = 1
