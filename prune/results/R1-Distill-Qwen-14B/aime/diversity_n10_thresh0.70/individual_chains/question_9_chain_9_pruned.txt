Okay, so I've got this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log_a(b) = c is equivalent to a^c = b. Maybe I can convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. If I rewrite this, it becomes x^10 = y^x. That seems manageable. So, x^10 = y^x. Let me write that down:

Equation 1: x^10 = y^x

Now, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the same logic, this converts to y^10 = x^{4y}. So:

Equation 2: y^10 = x^{4y}

Okay, so now I have two equations:

1. x^{10} = y^{x}
2. y^{10} = x^{4y}

I need to solve for x and y, and then find their product. Hmm, how can I solve these equations? Maybe I can express both equations in terms of exponents and see if I can relate them.

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides of both equations to bring down the exponents. That might help me relate x and y more directly.

Starting with Equation 1: x^10 = y^x

Taking natural log of both sides: ln(x^10) = ln(y^x)

Which simplifies to: 10 ln x = x ln y

So, Equation 1 becomes: 10 ln x = x ln y ... (1a)

Similarly, for Equation 2: y^{10} = x^{4y}

Taking natural log: ln(y^{10}) = ln(x^{4y})

Which simplifies to: 10 ln y = 4y ln x

So, Equation 2 becomes: 10 ln y = 4y ln x ... (2a)

Now, I have two equations with ln x and ln y. Let me see if I can solve for one variable in terms of the other.

From Equation (1a): 10 ln x = x ln y

I can solve for ln y: ln y = (10 ln x) / x ... (1b)

Similarly, from Equation (2a): 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Substitute ln y from (1b) into this equation:

10 * (10 ln x / x) = 4y ln x

Wait, let me write that step by step.

So, substituting ln y from (1b) into (2a):

10 * ( (10 ln x) / x ) = 4y ln x

Simplify the left side: (100 ln x)/x = 4y ln x

Hmm, I can cancel ln x from both sides as long as ln x is not zero. Since x > 1, ln x is positive, so that's fine.

So, dividing both sides by ln x:

100 / x = 4y

Which gives: (100)/x = 4y => y = (100)/(4x) = 25/x.

So, y = 25/x. Let's note that as Equation (3): y = 25/x.

Now, I can substitute this back into one of the previous equations to solve for x. Let's use Equation (1b): ln y = (10 ln x)/x.

But since y =25/x, ln y = ln(25/x) = ln(25) - ln x.

So, substituting into (1b): ln(25) - ln x = (10 ln x)/x.

Let me write that equation:

ln(25) - ln x = (10 ln x)/x.

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Let me rearrange it.

Bring all terms to one side: ln(25) = ln x + (10 ln x)/x.

Factor out ln x: ln(25) = ln x [1 + 10/x]

So, ln(25) = ln x * (x + 10)/x.

Hmm, let me write that as:

ln(25) = (ln x) * (x + 10)/x.

I need to solve for x here. This seems a bit tricky because x is both in the denominator and multiplied by 10. Maybe I can express this equation as:

(ln x) / (x + 10) = x / 25.

Wait, let me see:

From the above step:

ln(25) = (ln x) * (x + 10)/x

So, (ln x) = [ln(25) * x]/(x + 10)

So, (ln x)/(x) = [ln(25)]/(x + 10)

Hmm, perhaps I can denote t = x, so that I have ln(t)/t = [ln(25)]/(t + 10)

Not sure if that helps. Maybe I can set t = x, and then I have:

ln(t) = [ln(25) * t]/(t + 10)

This is a transcendental equation, meaning it's not solvable with simple algebra. Maybe I can try to find a substitution or make an intelligent guess for t.

Wait, maybe I can assume that x is a power of 25 or 5 or something, since 25 is a square number, and it might simplify things.

Let me think: Let's suppose that x is 5. Let's test x=5.

If x=5, then from Equation (3): y=25/5=5. So y=5.

Let me check if this satisfies the original equations.

Equation 1: log_x(y^x) = log_5(5^5) = log_5(3125). Since 5^5 is 3125, log base
