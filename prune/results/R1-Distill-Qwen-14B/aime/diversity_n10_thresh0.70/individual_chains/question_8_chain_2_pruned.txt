Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300, and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down.

First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward—it's a linear equation. The second equation looks more complicated, but maybe I can factor it somehow or relate it to the first equation.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is a product of two variables, one squared. Maybe I can factor out common terms. Let me see.

Let's group the terms:

= a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b
= a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Hmm, that seems helpful. Since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c).

So substituting those into the equation, we get:

= a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

So the second equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can rewrite this as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Yes, that seems correct because 300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³).

So now, I have:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I also know that a + b + c = 300. Maybe I can express a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of a + b + c and other symmetric sums.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). So, a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + ac + bc) = 300² - 2(ab + ac + bc).

Similarly, for the cubes, I think there's a formula for a³ + b³ + c³. Let me recall: a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

So, substituting a + b + c = 300, we get:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

Okay, so let me plug these expressions back into the second equation.

The equation becomes:

300[ (300² - 2(ab + ac + bc)) ] - [300³ - 3*300*(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 300*(300² - 2(ab + ac + bc)):

= 300*300² - 600*(ab + ac + bc)
= 300³ - 600*(ab + ac + bc)

Then, compute the second part: [300³ - 3*300*(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc]

So putting it all together:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = [300³ - 600*(ab + ac + bc)] - [300³ - 900*(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let me distribute the negative sign:

= 300³ - 600*(ab + ac + bc) - 300³ + 900*(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Simplify the terms:

300³ cancels out with -300³.

Now, for the (ab + ac + bc) terms:

-600*(ab + ac + bc) + 900*(ab + ac + bc) = 300*(ab + ac + bc).

So now, the equation becomes:

300*(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's simpler. So, 300*(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

I can factor out a 3:

3[100(ab + ac + bc) - abc] = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me write that as:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So now, I have two equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. 100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

This seems a bit more manageable. Maybe I can let x = ab + ac + bc and y = abc, then equation 2 becomes 100x - y = 2,000,000.

But I also have equation 1: a + b + c = 300.

I know that for symmetric equations in three variables, sometimes we can use the relationships between the roots of a cubic equation. Specifically, if a, b, c are roots of t³ - pt² + qt - r = 0, then:

p = a + b + c = 300,
q = ab + ac + bc = x,
r = abc = y.

So substituting, the cubic equation would be t³ - 300t² + x t - y = 0.

From equation 2, 100x - y = 2,000,000, so y = 100x - 2,000,000.

So the cubic equation becomes:

t³ - 300t² + x t - (100x - 2,000,000) = 0
= t³ - 300t² + x t - 100x + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can express x and y in terms of each other and find constraints.

Wait, another approach: I can think about the equation 100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000. Let me factor that:

abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can factor this as:

abc = 100(ab + ac + bc) - 2,000,000.

But I don't see an obvious way to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let s = ab + ac + bc, so then the equation is 100s - abc = 2,000,000.

So, abc = 100s - 2,000,000.

But I need another relationship between s and abc.

Wait, perhaps I can express the equation as:

abc = 100s -
