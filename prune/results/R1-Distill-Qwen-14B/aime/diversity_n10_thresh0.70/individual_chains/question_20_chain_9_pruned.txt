Okay, so I've got this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand what it's asking for. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable, so it's just about how many of each color we place where. The grid has 25 cells, so each cell can hold at most one chip. 

The conditions are:
1. Each cell can have at most one chip. So no two chips in the same cell.
2. All chips in the same row must be the same color. And the same goes for all chips in the same column.
3. Any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions. So the placement must be maximal, meaning we can't add any more chips without breaking the rules.

Hmm, so the placement should be such that if we try to add another chip, either the same row or column would end up having different colors, or we'd have two chips in the same cell.

Let me think about what this implies. Each row must be entirely one color or another, right? Because if a row has even one chip, all the other cells in that row can't have a different color. So, for each row, we can choose to have all white, all black, or no chips. But since we want the placement to be maximal, meaning we can't add any more chips, that suggests that if a row is partially filled, it's already at the point where adding another chip would force a color change, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, no. Actually, the way the condition is phrased, any additional chip would violate one or more of the conditions. So, if a row is already all white, we can't add a black chip to it, because that would violate the condition that all chips in the same row must be the same color. Similarly, if a row is all black, we can't add a white chip. But if a row is empty, we could add a chip, but the condition says that adding any chip would violate the conditions. So that implies that every row and every column must already be completely filled with chips of one color or the other. Because if a row is empty, we could add a chip, but then the row would have one chip, which is allowed, right? So maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no. Because the condition says that adding any additional chip would violate the conditions. So if a
