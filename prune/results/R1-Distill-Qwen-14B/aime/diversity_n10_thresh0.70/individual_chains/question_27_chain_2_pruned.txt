Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by revolving a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of revolution is 6. So, the major radius R of the torus is 6, and the minor radius r is 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The problem talks about two scenarios: when the torus is resting inside the sphere and when it's resting outside. In both cases, they are tangent along a circle, and I need to find the radii of these circles, r_i for internal and r_o for external. Then, compute the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about each case separately.

First, when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent to it. So, the sphere is larger, and the torus is just touching the sphere from the inside. The point of tangency is along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, it's touching the sphere along another circle.

I remember that the torus can be described in coordinates. Let me recall the parametrization. A torus is often given by the equation in 3D where the distance from the center of the tube to the axis (R = 6) and the radius of the tube itself (r = 3). So, the parametrization would involve angles θ and φ, but maybe I don't need that for this problem.

Instead, perhaps I should think about the geometry of the situation. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere has radius 11, and the torus is touching it. The centers are aligned, I suppose. So, the center of the sphere is at some point, and the center of the generating circle of the torus is at a distance of R = 6 from the axis, but wait, the sphere is enclosing the torus. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should consider the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus. Let me think. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center and the torus's center (the center of the generating circle) must be aligned. The sphere's radius is 11, and the torus has a major radius of 6. So, when the torus is inside, the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center would be 11 minus something.

Wait, maybe not. Let me try to draw a diagram. Imagine the sphere with center O, and the torus is inside it. The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of that circle. So, the center of the generating circle is at a distance of 6 from the axis, making the major radius R = 6.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere must contain the entire torus. The farthest point on the torus from the sphere's center would be where? It would be the point that's farthest along the major radius direction. So, the maximum distance from the sphere's center to any point on the torus would be the distance from O to the center of the generating circle plus the major radius plus the minor radius.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The torus is a surface of revolution, so the maximum distance from the sphere's center to a point on the torus would be if you go from the sphere's center to the center of the generating circle (let's say that distance is D), then add the major radius R and minor radius r. Wait, but in this case, when the torus is inside the sphere, the maximum distance from O to any point on the torus should be equal to the sphere's radius, which is 11.

Wait, maybe I need
