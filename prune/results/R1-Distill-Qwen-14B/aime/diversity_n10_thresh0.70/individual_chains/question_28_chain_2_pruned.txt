Okay, so I have this geometry problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given with specific lengths: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). I need to find the distance from the incenter I to each face, and express that distance in the form mâˆšn / p, then find m + n + p.

Hmm, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces, kind of like the 3D version of the incenter in a triangle. That distance is called the inradius. So I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

First, I think I should find the volume of the tetrahedron because the formula for the inradius involves the volume. I recall that the formula for the inradius r is 3 times the volume divided by the sum of the areas of the four faces. So, r = 3V / (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4), where V is the volume and A1, A2, A3, A4 are the areas of the four faces.

But wait, to find the volume, I might need more information about the tetrahedron's structure. The edges are given in a symmetric way, which might imply that this is a kind of "isohedral" tetrahedron, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's a disphenoid? A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, which seems to be the case here since AB=CD, AC=BD, and BC=AD. So yes, ABCD is a disphenoid.

I remember that in a disphenoid, all faces are congruent triangles. Wait, is that true? Let me think. If opposite edges are equal, does that mean all faces are congruent? Let me check: Each face is a triangle with sides from the three different pairs. For example, face ABC has sides AB, BC, and AC. AB is sqrt(41), BC is sqrt(89), and AC is sqrt(80). Similarly, face ABD has sides AB, BD, and AD. AB is sqrt(41), BD is sqrt(80), and AD is sqrt(89). So each face has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), which means all four faces are congruent triangles. That's helpful because then all face areas are the same, so I can compute the area once and multiply by four.

So, first step: compute the area of one face, say triangle ABC with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Since all four faces are congruent, each has the same area. Let's denote this area as A. Then, the total surface area is 4A.

But wait, actually, in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent, so yes, each face has the same area. So I can compute the area of one face and multiply by four.

So, let's compute the area of triangle ABC. The sides are a = sqrt(
