Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product of two real numbers x and y, both greater than 1. The given conditions are that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) also equals 10. Hmm, that's interesting.

Let me write down what's given:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I remember that logarithms have some properties that might help here. Specifically, log_b(a^c) = c*log_b(a). So, maybe I can apply that to both equations.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the power rule, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Hmm, wait, that's not right. Wait, no, the power rule is log_b(a^c) = c*log_b(a). So actually, log_x(y^x) is x * log_x(y), right? And that equals 10.

Similarly, for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the power rule here gives 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, I need to find x and y such that both these equations are satisfied. Maybe I can express log_x(y) and log_y(x) in terms of each other.

I recall that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as k. Then log_y(x) would be 1/k.

So substituting into the equations:

1. x * k = 10
2. 4y * (1/k) = 10

From the first equation, x = 10 / k.

From the second equation: 4y / k = 10 => y = (10 * k) / 4 = (5k)/2.

So now I have expressions for x and y in terms of k.

x = 10/k
y = (5k)/2

Now, since we have expressions for x and y in terms of k, maybe we can relate them somehow. Alternatively, I can use the relationship between x and y.

Wait, but I also know that log_x(y) = k. Let me write that using the change of base formula. Because log_x(y) = ln(y)/ln(x) = k.

But I already have y in terms of k and x in terms of k, so perhaps I can substitute those in.

So, y = (5k)/2 and x = 10/k.

So, log_x(y) = ln(y)/ln(x) = k.

Substituting y and x:

ln((5k)/2) / ln(10/k) = k.

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but maybe I can manipulate it.

Let me denote A = ln((5k)/2) and B = ln(10/k). Then A/B = k.

So, A = k * B.

Expressed as:

ln((5k)/2) = k * ln(10/k)

Let me expand both sides.

Left side: ln(5k/2) = ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2)
Right side: k * [ln(10) - ln(k)]

So, the equation becomes:

ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2) = k * ln(10) - k * ln(k)

Hmm, that's:

ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2) = k ln(10) - k ln(k)

Let me rearrange the terms:

ln(5)
