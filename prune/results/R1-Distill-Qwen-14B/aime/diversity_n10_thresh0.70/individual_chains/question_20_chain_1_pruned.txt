Okay, so I've got this math problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, and they're indistinguishable. So, each chip is either white or black, but we can't tell one white chip from another, same with black.

We need to place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of a 5x5 grid. Each cell can have at most one chip. So, no cell can have more than one chip, which makes sense because it's a unit cell.

Now, there are some conditions to satisfy:

1. All chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for all chips in the same column. So, if I place a white chip in a row, every other cell in that row must either be white or empty. The same rule applies to columns.

2. Additionally, any extra chip we try to place on the grid would violate one or both of the previous conditions. That means the configuration we come up with must be such that adding another chip isn't possible without breaking the row or column uniformity.

So, our goal is to find the number of such valid configurations.

Hmm, okay. Let's think about how the grid can be filled. Each row has to be all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column must be all white, all black, or empty. But there's also a condition that once we place the chips, we can't add any more without violating the rules.

Wait, but waitâ€”if a row is empty, can we add a chip to it? Well, adding a chip to an empty row would require that the entire row becomes that color. So, for example, if a row is empty, and we add a white chip, then the entire row must become white. But before adding, if that row is empty, but the corresponding columns have some chips, we need to make sure that adding that white chip doesn't conflict with the column's existing colors.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to model the problem as each row and column can be either white, black, or empty. But with the condition that the placement is maximal, meaning you can't add any more chips.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the grid has 25 cells, so each cell can either have a chip or not. But each row and column must be monochromatic if they have any chips.

So, perhaps another way to think about it is that each row can be either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly for each column. But also, the configuration must be such that adding another chip is not possible.

Wait, but how does that relate to the rows and columns? Let me think.

Suppose I decide that each row is either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column is either all white, all black, or empty. But since the grid is finite, the rows and columns can't be all white or all black if their corresponding columns or rows have other colors.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this problem by considering that each row is assigned a color, and each column is assigned a color. But the color assignments have to be compatible in the sense that if a cell is in a row that's color X and a column that's color Y,
