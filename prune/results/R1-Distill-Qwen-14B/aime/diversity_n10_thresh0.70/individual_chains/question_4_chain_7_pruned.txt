Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 make Bob the winner, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, so this sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that these types of problems often involve figuring out winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite—no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, the goal here is to find all the n where Bob can force a win. Since Alice goes first, that means for Bob to have a winning strategy, n must be a losing position for the first player (Alice). So, I need to identify which n are losing positions.

Let me start by trying to model this. Let's denote the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). The base case is when there are no tokens left, but since the last token wins, if a player is forced to play when there are no tokens, they lose. Wait, no—actually, the last player to take a token wins. So, if a player is faced with 0 tokens on their turn, they lose because they can't make a move. But in our case, the game starts with n tokens, so the losing positions are those where the player whose turn it is cannot make a move that leads to a win, given optimal play from the opponent.

Let me set up a table for small n to see the pattern.

n=0: There are no tokens. So the player to move loses. So n=0 is an L position.

n=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is W.

n=2: The player can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is a W position for them. Wait, but if I take 1, opponent can take 1 and win. Wait, no—if n=2, player takes 1, leaves n=1 for opponent, who can take 1 and win. So that would mean n=2 is a losing position? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's think again.

At n=
