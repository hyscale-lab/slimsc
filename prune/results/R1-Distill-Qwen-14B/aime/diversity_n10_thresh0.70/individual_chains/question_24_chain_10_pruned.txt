Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again and try to figure out what I need to do.

The problem says:

A list of positive integers has the following properties:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. I think I should first recall what each term means.

- **Sum of the items**: That's straightforward. The total when you add all the numbers together is 30.

- **Unique mode is 9**: Mode is the number that appears most frequently. So 9 appears more times than any other number in the list, and it's the only one with that highest frequency.

- **Median is a positive integer not in the list**: The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. But in this case, the median isn't actually one of the numbers in the list. That's interesting because usually, the median is part of the data set unless it's an even number of terms and falls between two numbers.

So, I need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies all these conditions. Once I have the list, I can compute the sum of their squares.

Let me start by thinking about the mode. Since 9 is the unique mode, it has to appear more times than any other number. So, if I have a list where, say, 9 appears twice, then all other numbers can appear at most once. But wait, maybe 9 appears three times, and others appear twice? No, because if 9 is the unique mode, no other number can have the same count as 9. So, if 9 appears three times, others can appear at most two times. Hmm, but maybe it's better to have 9 appear more times to make it easier.

Wait, let me think. If I have 9 appearing three times, that might be enough. Let me see.

But I don't know how many numbers are in the list yet. That's another variable. Let me denote the number of elements as n. Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, n can't be odd because, for an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, which is part of the list. So n must be even because the median is not in the list. That makes sense.

Wait, no, actually, for an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. So if those two middle numbers are different, then the median could be a number not in the list. For example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, the median is 9, which isn't in the list. So that fits. So n must be even.

So, n is even. Let me denote n as 2k, where k is a positive integer.

The median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements. So those two elements must average to some integer, which is the median. Let's say the median is m, which is a positive integer not in the list.

So, the two middle numbers must be two integers that add up to 2m, and m is not in the list.

So, the two middle numbers could be m-1 and m+1, which average to m. Then, the median is m, which is not in the list. That would work.

Alternatively, they could be two numbers that are not consecutive but average to m, but I think m-1 and m+1 is the simplest case.

So, the two middle numbers would have to be such that one is less than m and the other is greater than m. Or, maybe both are equal? Wait, no, because if they are equal, then m would be equal to that number, which would be in the list. But the median is not in the list, so the two middle numbers must not be equal. So, they have to be two different numbers whose average is m, and m is not in the list.

So, let me think about how to structure the list.

Since the mode is 9, 9 has to appear more times than any other number. So, I need to have at least two 9s, but probably more.

Let me think about the minimal case. Let's suppose the list has 6 elements. Then, the two middle numbers (3rd and 4th) would determine the median. If the median is an integer not in the list, that would work.

But let's see: Let's try n=6.

If n=6, the sum is 30. The list has to include several 9s and other numbers.

Since 9 is the unique mode, it has to appear more than any other number. So, if I have 9 appearing three times, others can appear at most two times. But in a 6-element list, three 9s would take up half the list, so the other three numbers can be anything else, but must not exceed two of any number.

Wait, but if I have three 9s, the other three numbers can be, say, 1, 2, and 3, each appearing once. Then, the list would be [1,2,3,9,9,9], but that sums to 1+2+3+9+9+9 = 33, which is more than 30. So that won't work.

Alternatively, maybe having two 9s
