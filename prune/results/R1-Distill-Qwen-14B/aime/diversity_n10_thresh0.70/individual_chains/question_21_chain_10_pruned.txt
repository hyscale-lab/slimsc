Okay, so I've got this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Hmm, let's see. The problem says that a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base b, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. The example they gave is 81 being 13-eautiful because 81 is 63 in base 13, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is sqrt(81). 

The task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A number n is b-eautiful if:

1. When written in base b, it has exactly two digits. That means n is between b^1 and b^2 - 1, inclusive. Because the smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b, which is b in decimal, and the largest is (b-1)(b-1)_b which is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 - 1.

2. The sum of the two digits equals sqrt(n). So, if n in base b is written as d1 d0, then d1 + d0 = sqrt(n).

So, let me formalize this. Let n be a number such that in base b, it's represented by digits d1 and d0. Then:

n = d1 * b + d0

And, the condition is:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(n)

So, substituting n from the first equation into the second:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1 * b + d0)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1 * b + d0

Expanding the left side:

d1² + 2*d1*d0 + d0² = d1*b + d0

Let me rearrange this equation:

d1² + 2*d1*d0 + d0² - d1*b - d0 = 0

Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of d1 and d0. But maybe I can rearrange it differently to make it more manageable.

Wait, let's consider the equation again:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0

Let me denote s = d1 + d0. Then the equation becomes:

s² = d1*b + d0

But since s = d1 + d0, we can express d0 in terms of s and d1: d0 = s - d1.

Substituting back into the equation:

s² = d1*b + (s - d1)

Simplify the right side:

s² = d1*(b - 1) + s

Let me rearrange:

d1*(b - 1) = s² - s

So,

d1 = (s² - s)/(b - 1)

Since d1 must be an integer (because it's a digit in base b), the numerator (s² - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, d1 must satisfy 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b - 1, because it's the leading digit of a two-digit number in base b.

Similarly, since d0 = s - d1, and d0 must also be a digit in base b, so 0 ≤ d0 ≤ b - 1. So, s must satisfy that d0 is within that range.

Let me outline the steps I need to take:

1. For a given base b, find all possible pairs (d1, d0) such that d1 is between 1 and b-1, d0 is between 0 and b-1, and d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1*b + d0).

2. Since d1 and d0 are digits, s = d1 + d0 must be an integer, and s² = n = d1*b + d0.

3. So, for each b, I can iterate over possible s values, compute d1, check if it's an integer within the digit range, then compute d0 and check if it's within the digit range. If both are satisfied, then n is b-eautiful.

But since I need to find the minimal b such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers, I probably need to find for each b, how many such numbers exist, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.

Let me think about how to parameterize this.

From earlier, we have:

s² = d1*b + d0

But d0 = s - d1, so:

s² = d1*b + (s - d1) => s² = d1*(b - 1) + s

So,

d1 = (s² - s)/(b - 1)

Since d1 must be an integer, (s² - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, d1 must be between 1 and b - 1, and d0 = s - d1 must be between 0 and b - 1.

So, for a given b, s can range from what? Well, s is the sum of two digits: d1 and d0. d1 is at least 1, d0 is at least 0. So the minimum s is 1. What about the maximum? The maximum d1 is b - 1, and d0 is b - 1, so s can be up to 2b - 2.

But considering that s² = n = d1*b + d0, and n is a two-digit number in base b, which is up to b² - 1. So s² ≤ b² - 1. So s ≤ sqrt(b² - 1) ≈ b - 0.5. So s can be up to b - 1.

Wait, maybe that's an important point. Since s = sqrt(n), and n is a two-digit number in base b, which is at most b² - 1. So s can be at most sqrt(b² - 1) ≈ b - 0.5. So s must be less than or equal to b - 1, because s must be an integer. So s ranges from 1 to b - 1.

So, for a given base b, s can take values from 1 to b - 1.

So, for each base b, s can be from 1 to b - 1, and for each s, compute d1 = (s² - s)/(b - 1). If this is an integer, and 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b - 1, then compute d0 = s - d1, and check if 0 ≤ d0 ≤ b - 1. If so, then n is b-eautiful.

Therefore, the number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b is equal to the number of s in [1, b - 1] such that (s² - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and the resulting d1 and d0 are valid digits.

So, the plan is:

- For each base b starting from 2 upwards, compute the number of s in [1, b - 1] where (s² - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and the corresponding d1 and d0 are valid digits. 

- Once I find a base b where the count exceeds 10, that's my answer.

But this might take a while, considering I don't know how high b needs to go. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, for each b, the number of s such that (s² - s) is divisible by (b - 1). So, (s² - s) ≡ 0 mod (b - 1). 

Which can be written as s(s - 1) ≡ 0 mod (b - 1).

So, for each s in [1, b - 1], we need s(s - 1) divisible by (b - 1).

Hmm, that's interesting. So, for each b, the number of s in [1, b - 1] where s(s - 1) is divisible by (b - 1). 

That's the key condition. So, for each b, the number of
