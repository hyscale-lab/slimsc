Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of the sides: AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. First, let me sketch out what I know. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. So, sides AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10. Since all sides are given, maybe I can find some angles or other properties using the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines.

Wait, but the problem involves tangents to the circumcircle at B and C. Point D is where the two tangents meet. I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the exsymmedian point or something like that? Or maybe it's called the symmedian point? Wait, no, the symmedian point is inside the triangle, but D is outside because it's the intersection of tangents from B and C.

I think D is called the ex-pole or something. Anyway, the main idea is that D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C. So, from D, we have two tangent segments DB and DC, which are equal in length. Because from a point outside the circle, the lengths of the two tangents to the circle are equal. So, DB = DC.

Now, we're supposed to look at line AD, which connects A to D, and this line intersects the circumcircle again at P. So, AP is the segment from A to P, which is the second intersection point of AD and ω.

I need to find the ratio in which AD is divided by the circle, or perhaps find the length of AP directly.

Let me recall some theorems that might help here. There's the Power of a Point theorem, which says that for a point D outside a circle, the square of the tangent length is equal to the product of the lengths from D to the points where a secant from D intersects the circle. So, in this case, the power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DP * DA.

Wait, yes, because DA is the secant line passing through D and intersecting the circle at A and P. So, the power of D would give us DB² = DP * DA.

Let me write that down:

DB² = DP * DA.

So, if I can find DB, then I can relate DP and DA, and since DA = DP + PA, I can maybe set up an equation to solve for PA.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use harmonic division or something related to poles and polars, but I might be getting ahead of myself.

First, let me try to find
