Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many residents of Aimeville own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me list out all the given information to make sure I have everything straight. There are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's one thing everyone has. Then, 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. 

Additionally, I know that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. The question is asking for the number of people who own all four items. Hmm, this seems like a problem that involves sets and maybe the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the size of the union of multiple sets by considering their intersections.

Let me denote the sets as follows:
- Let D be the set of people who own a diamond ring.
- Let G be the set of people who own a set of golf clubs.
- Let S be the set of people who own a garden spade.
- Let C be the set of people who own a bag of candy hearts.

Wait, but the problem says that every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so C has 900 people. That might simplify things a bit because C is the universal set here. So, everyone is in C, which means any combination of the other three items will always include C.

But let me think again. The problem is about four items, but since everyone owns the candy hearts, the other three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) are optional. So, the problem is about these three items plus the mandatory candy hearts. So, the four items are D, G, S, and C. But since C is universal, maybe it's easier to think of the problem as three items plus the C, which is a given.

Wait, no. The problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so C is universal. So, when it talks about owning exactly two of these things, it's considering all four, including C. So
