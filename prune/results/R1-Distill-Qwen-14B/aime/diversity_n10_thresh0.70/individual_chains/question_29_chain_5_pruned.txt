Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The problem says that points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. So, that's a cyclic quadrilateral. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let me visualize this. Let's sketch it out mentally. So, rectangle ABCD: I know that in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, AB is 107, BC is 16. So, AB is one side, BC is the adjacent side. So, ABCD must be a rectangle where AB is 107 units and BC is 16 units. Therefore, AD must be 16 units as well, and DC is 107 units.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH: given FG =17 and EF=184. So, EF and FG are sides of the rectangle. So, EF is 184, FG is 17, meaning that the sides of EFGH are 184 and 17.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the points D and C are from rectangle ABCD, and E and F are from rectangle EFGH. So, these four points lie on a straight line. So, let's think about the order of these points on the line.

Assuming the line is horizontal, then maybe E is to the left of D, D is next, then C, then F. Or maybe another order. But since E and F are from the rectangle EFGH, which is another rectangle.

Wait, but considering the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, ADGH is a cyclic quadrilateral. So, A is a vertex of rectangle ABCD, D is another vertex, H is a vertex of EFGH, and G is another vertex of EFGH. So, points A, D, H, G are on a circle, which is given.

I think I need to find some relationship between these rectangles and the circle. Maybe using some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals or similar triangles or something else.

Let me try to assign coordinates to these points to make it easier. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point C would be at (107, 16) because BC is 16, and AB is 107. Wait, no, actually, if D is at (0,0), then since ABCD is a rectangle, the adjacent sides would be AD and DC.

Wait, actually, in rectangle ABCD, AB is 107, BC is 16. So, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (AB, BC) or maybe (AD, BC)? Wait, maybe I should define the coordinates more carefully.

Let me assign coordinates:

Letâ€™s place point D at (0, 0).

Since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB is 107, BC is 16.

So, if D is (0,0), then C (next to D) would be along the x-axis, so C is at (107, 0). Then, since BC is 16, point B would be at (107, 16), and A would be at (0, 16).

Wait, is that right? Wait, ABCD is a rectangle, so the order of the points is A, B, C, D. So, if D is (0,0), then moving clockwise, C would be (a, 0), B would be (a, b), and A would be (0, b). But in this case, AB is 1
