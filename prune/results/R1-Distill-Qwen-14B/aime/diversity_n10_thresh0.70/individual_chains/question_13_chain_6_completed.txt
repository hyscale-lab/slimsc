Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how long Aya's walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says that every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. So, the total distance she walks is always 9 kilometers. The time it takes her depends on her walking speed, and she also spends some time, t minutes, at the coffee shop. 

The problem gives me two scenarios:

1. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, her total time is 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. 
2. When she walks at s + 2 kilometers per hour, her total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including t minutes in the coffee shop.

I need to find the time it takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

Let me start by translating these scenarios into equations. 

In the first case:

- Speed = s km/h
- Total time = 4 hours, which includes walking time plus t minutes. But wait, t is in minutes, and the total time is in hours, so I should convert t minutes to hours to keep the units consistent. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, the total time is walking time plus coffee shop time. Walking time is distance divided by speed, so 9 km divided by s km/h. Therefore, the equation for the first scenario is:

Walking time + Coffee time = Total time
9/s + t/60 = 4 hours.

Similarly, for the second scenario:

- Speed = s + 2 km/h
- Total time = 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert 24 minutes to hours: 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So, total time is 2.4 hours.

Again, walking time is 9/(s+2) hours, and coffee time is t/60 hours. So the equation is:

9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4.

Now, I have two equations with two variables, s and t. So I can solve for s and t first.

Let me write down the two equations:

1. 9/s + t/60 = 4. 
2. 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4.

Hmm, perhaps I can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate t. Let me try that.

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s + 2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4.

Simplify this:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6.

So, 9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6.

I can factor out the 9:

9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6.

Let me compute 1/s - 1/(s + 2):

That's equal to [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)].

So, 9 * [2 / (s(s + 2)) ] = 1.6.

So, 18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6.

Let me write that as:

18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2).

Compute 1.6 * s(s + 2):

1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s.

So, equation becomes:

18 = 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s.

Hmm, I can write this as a quadratic equation:

1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0.

But dealing with decimals can be a bit messy. Maybe I can multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the decimal:

16 s^2 + 32 s - 180 = 0.

Wait, 1.6 *10 =16, 3.2*10=32, 18*10=180.

But 16 s^2 +32 s -180=0.

Hmm, perhaps I can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 4:

4 s^2 + 8 s -45=0.

Yes, because 16/4=4, 32/4=8, 180/4=45.

So now, the quadratic equation is:

4 s^2 +8 s -45=0.

This seems more manageable. Let me try to solve for s using the quadratic formula.

Quadratic formula: s = [ -b ± sqrt(b² -4ac) ] / (2a)

Here, a=4, b=8, c=-45.

So:

s = [ -8 ± sqrt(8^2 -4*4*(-45)) ] / (2*4)
= [ -8 ± sqrt(64 + 720) ] / 8
= [ -8 ± sqrt(784) ] /8
= [ -8 ± 28 ] /8

So, two possible solutions:

1. [ -8 +28 ] /8 = 20/8 =2.5
2. [ -8 -28 ] /8 = (-36)/8 =-4.5

Since speed can't be negative, s=2.5 km/h.

So, s=2.5. Now, I can find t using one of the original equations.

Let me take the first equation:

9/s + t/60 =4.

Substituting s=2.5:

9/2.5 + t/60 =4.

Compute 9/2.5:

2.5 goes into 9 how many times? 2.5 *3=7.5, 2.5*3.6=9. So, 9/2.5=3.6 hours.

So:

3.6 + t/60 =4.

Subtract 3.6:

t/60=0.4.

Multiply both sides by 60:

t=24 minutes.

So, t=24 minutes.

Now, the problem asks: Suppose Aya walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

So, her new speed is s + 1/2 = 2.5 +0.5 =3 km/h.

So, the walking time is 9 km divided by 3 km/h, which is 3 hours.

Then, adding t=24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours, but wait, the question asks for the total time in minutes, including t minutes. So, 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 204 minutes.

Wait, let me check:

Walking time at 3 km/h is 9/3 =3 hours=180 minutes.

Plus coffee time t=24 minutes.

Total time is 180 +24=204 minutes.

So, the final answer is 204 minutes.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, solving for s: equations gave s=2.5, which makes sense. Then, t=24 minutes.

Then, at s + 0.5=3 km/h, walking time is 3 hours. Plus 24 minutes, total 204 minutes. 

Yes, that seems correct.


Aya's walking scenarios can be modeled with two equations based on her speed and total time, including coffee shop time. Solving these equations yields her walking speed \( s = 2.5 \) km/h and coffee shop time \( t = 24 \) minutes. When walking at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h, the walking time is 3 hours (180 minutes) plus 24 minutes, totaling 204 minutes.

**Answer:** \boxed{204}
