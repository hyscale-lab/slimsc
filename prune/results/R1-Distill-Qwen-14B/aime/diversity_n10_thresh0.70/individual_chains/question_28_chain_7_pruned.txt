Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about a tetrahedron, which is like a 3D shape with four triangular faces. The tetrahedron is labeled ABCD, and it has some specific edge lengths. The edges AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). The question is asking about a point I inside this tetrahedron that's equidistant from all four faces. That point sounds familiarâ€”I think it's called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from this incenter to each face is what we're supposed to find, and then express it in a specific form and sum up some numbers.

Alright, so first, I need to visualize this tetrahedron. Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe this tetrahedron has some kind of symmetry. Let me note down the given edge lengths:

- AB = CD = sqrt(41)
- AC = BD = sqrt(80)
- BC = AD = sqrt(89)

Hmm, so each pair of opposite edges is equal, which suggests that the tetrahedron might be isosceles or maybe even regular? But wait, in a regular tetrahedron, all edges are equal, but here they have different lengths, so it's not regular. However, the fact that opposite edges are equal might mean it has some symmetry.

I remember that in such tetrahedrons, the inradius (the radius of the inscribed sphere touching all faces) can be found if we know the volume and the total surface area. The formula is similar to the inradius in a triangle, which is area divided by semiperimeter. For a tetrahedron, it's 3 times volume divided by the total surface area. Wait, let me confirm that.

Yes, for a tetrahedron, the inradius r is given by r = 3V / A, where V is the volume and A is the total surface area. So, to find r, I need to compute V and A.

But how do I compute the volume of this tetrahedron? Since I know all the edges, maybe I can use some formula that relates edge lengths to volume. I recall that for a tetrahedron, if it's isosceles (opposite edges equal), there's a formula for the volume. Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates to compute it.

Using coordinates might be a good approach. Let me try that. If I can assign coordinates to the vertices A, B, C, D such that the edge lengths are satisfied, then I can compute the volume using the scalar triple product.

Let's choose a coordinate system to make things easier. Let me place vertex A at (0, 0, 0). Then, let me place vertex B at (x, 0, 0) on the x-axis. Vertex C can be placed in the xy-plane, say at (a, b, 0), and vertex D will be somewhere in 3D space, say at (c, d, e). Hmm, but this might get complicated with so many variables. Maybe there's a smarter way to place the points
