Okay, so I need to solve this math problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the conditions.

We have a list of positive integers with three properties:
1. The sum of all items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.

And the goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's recall some definitions to make sure I'm on the right track.

- **Mode**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. The problem says it's unique, so only 9 appears more times than any other number.
- **Median**: The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. If there's an even number of items, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, it's mentioned that the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So the median must be a whole number not present in the list.

Let me start by thinking about the mode. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So, if the list has n elements, 9 appears at least twice, and every other number appears fewer times.

Next, the median. Let's consider the possible cases for the number of elements in the list. Because the median is an integer not in the list, this might affect how the list is structured.

I think I should figure out the possible lengths of the list. Let's denote n as the number of elements. Since the median depends on whether n is odd or even.

Case 1: n is odd.
Then, the median is the (n+1)/2-th term. This median must be an integer not present in the list. So, this term is some integer m, which is not in the list.

Case 2: n is even.
Then, the median is the average of the n/2-th and (n/2 +1)-th terms. But since the median is an integer, the average must be integer, so those two middle terms must be either both even or both odd. Also, this median should not appear in the list.

Wait, but if the median is an integer not present in the list, then in the case of even n, the two middle numbers must be such that their average is an integer not in the list. Hmm.

But let me think about what the median can be. Since all numbers are positive integers, the median must be at least 1.

Also, the sum is 30, so the average is 30/n. Depending on n, the average could be more or less than the median.

But maybe it's easier to try to find possible n and see which one fits.

Let me think about possible values of n. Since the sum is 30, n can't be too big. Let's see, the maximum possible n is 30 (if all are 1s), but since 9 is the mode, n has to be such that 9 can appear more than any other number.

Wait, the minimum number of 9s is two, but since it's unique mode, other numbers can have at most one occurrence less than 9. So, if 9 appears k times, other numbers can appear at most k-1 times.

So, if 9 appears twice, others can appear once. If 9 appears three times, others can appear at most two times, but 9 is still the unique mode.

So, let's see possible n.

Let me try to think of n as small as possible. Let's consider n=5.

Wait, sum is 30, n=5, average is 6. So, the median is the 3rd term, which must be an integer not in the list.

Wait, but with n=5, the median is the third term. If that third term is m
