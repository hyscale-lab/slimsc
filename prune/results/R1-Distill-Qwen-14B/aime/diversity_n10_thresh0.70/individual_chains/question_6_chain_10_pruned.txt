Okay, so I have this problem here. I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: one is y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and the other is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I should understand what the functions f(x) and g(x) are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So both are absolute value functions inside absolute values, which usually create V-shaped graphs. Let me analyze each one.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2, so the vertex becomes at (0, -1/2). But since we take the absolute value of that, any negative part will be reflected above the x-axis. So let's consider different cases for x.

When |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.

When |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.

So f(x) is a V-shape with vertices at |x| = 1/2. Let's plot it: at x=0, f(x)=1/2. As |x| increases beyond 1/2, it decreases linearly. Wait, no, actually, when |x| >= 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which means it's increasing as |x| increases beyond 1/2. So the graph of f(x) will have a V-shape at x = 1/2 and x = -1/2, with the minimum value at these points being 0, and it goes up on either side.

Wait, let me think again. When |x| is 1/2, f(x) is 0. For |x| > 1/2, f(x) is |x| - 1/2, which is positive and increasing as |x| increases. For |x| < 1/2, f(x) is 1/2 - |x|, which is positive, decreasing as |x| approaches 1/2. So the graph of f(x) looks like a W? No, wait, it's an M? Wait, no. Wait, no, because f(x) is symmetric about the y-axis. Let me see: at x=0, f(0)=1/2. At x=1/2 and x=-1/2, f(x)=0. Then as x moves beyond 1/2 or below -1/2, f(x) increases linearly. So the graph is like a tent with peaks at (1/2, 0)
