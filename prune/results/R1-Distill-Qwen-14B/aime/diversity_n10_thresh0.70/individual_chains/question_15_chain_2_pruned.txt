Okay, so I need to solve this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which makes sense because an 8x8 grid means you have to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. The question specifies that the paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, direction changes... I think that refers to switching from moving right to up or up to right. Each time the direction changes, the path switches between these two movements.

Let me visualize this. On a grid, starting from the lower left corner (let's say (0,0)) and moving towards the upper right corner (8,8). Each path consists of a series of horizontal and vertical moves. A direction change happens each time you switch from moving right (east) to moving up (north) or vice versa.

So, for example, if I go right, right, up, up, right, right, up, up, that's a few direction changes. Let's count: right to up is one change, up to right is another, right to up is another. So that's three direction changes. Each direction change adds a new segment to the path.

Wait, so each time I change direction, I start a new segment in either the horizontal or vertical direction. So, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of segments. For example, if I have four segments, that means three direction changes. So, if I need exactly four direction changes, that would result in five segments.

Wait, no. Wait, if I have four direction changes, then I have five segments. Because each direction change starts a new segment. So, initial direction is one segment, each change adds a new segment. So, four changes mean five segments. So, the path is divided into five segments, alternating between horizontal and vertical.

Since we start at (0,0) and end at (8,8), the path must consist of moving right and up alternately. So, the number of direction changes is four, meaning that the number of segments is five. So, the path alternates between right and up moves, starting with either right or up.

But wait, in an 8x8 grid, moving from (0,0) to (8,8), the number of right moves must be 8, and the number of up moves must be 8. So, if the path is divided into five segments, each segment
