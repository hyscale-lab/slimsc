Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\). Hmm, okay. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number \(z\) can be represented in polar form as \(z = re^{i\theta}\), where \(r\) is the modulus (which is 4 in this case) and \(\theta\) is the argument. Since \(|z| = 4\), we can write \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). That might make things easier to handle.

Given that, let me substitute \(z\) with \(4e^{i\theta}\) in the expression:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Simplify each part. First, let's compute the first term:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}
\]
Which is \(4 \times (75 + 117i) \times e^{i\theta}\). Let me compute the scalar multiplication first:

\(4 \times 75 = 300\)
\(4 \times 117 = 468\)
So, the first term becomes \(300 + 468i\) multiplied by \(e^{i\theta}\). Hmm, but actually, I might want to express everything in terms of \(\theta\) and see if I can combine the terms.

Wait, maybe it's better to separate the expression into real and imaginary parts after substitution. Let me proceed step by step.

Let me denote \(A = 75 + 117i\) and \(B = 96 + 144i\), so the expression becomes:

\[
A z + \frac{B}{z}
\]

Since \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), then \(1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\). So substituting:

\[
A \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + B \cdot \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]

Which is \(4A e^{i\theta} + \frac{B}{4} e^{-i\theta}\).

Let me compute each term separately.

First, compute \(4A\):

\(4A = 4(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i\)

Similarly, compute \(B/4\):

\(B/4 = (96 + 144i)/4 = 24 + 36i\)

So now, the expression is:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Now, I need to compute this sum. Let me recall that \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\).

So, expanding each term:

First term: \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
Second term: \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)

Let me compute each product.

Compute first term:

Multiply \(300 + 468i\) with \(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta\):

= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2 \sin\theta

Since \(i^2 = -1\), this becomes:

= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468 \sin\theta

Group real and imaginary parts:

Real: 300\cos\theta - 468 \sin\theta

Imaginary: (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta) i

Similarly, compute the second term:

Multiply \(24 + 36i\) with \(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta\):

= 24\cos\theta -24i\sin\theta +36i \cos\theta -36i^2 \sin\theta

Again, \(i^2 = -1\), so:

=24\cos\theta -24i\sin\theta +36i\cos\theta +36 \sin\theta

Group real and imaginary parts:

Real: 24\cos\theta + 36 \sin\theta

Imaginary: (-24\sin\theta +36\cos\theta) i

Now, add the two results together.

First, add the real parts:

(300\cos\theta - 468 \sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta +36 \sin\theta) = (300 +24)\cos\theta + (-468 +36)\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta -432 \sin\theta

Now, add the imaginary parts:

(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta + (-24\sin\theta +36\cos\theta)) i = (300 -24)\sin\theta + (468 +36)\cos\theta) i = 276\sin\theta + 504 \cos\theta) i

So, the entire expression is:

Real part: 324\cos\theta -432 \sin\theta

Imaginary part: 276\sin\theta + 504 \cos\theta

But the problem asks for the largest possible real part of the expression. So, we can focus on the real part, which is:

Re = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

We need to find the maximum value of Re as θ varies.

Hmm, this is a real function of θ, and to find its maximum, I can treat it as a single sinusoidal function.

Recall that expressions of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be written as C cos(θ + φ), where C = sqrt(A² + B²) and tanφ = B/A.

Wait, actually, in our case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So, it's in the form A cosθ + B sinθ, where A = 324 and B = -432.

So, to find the maximum value, we can compute the amplitude, which is sqrt(A² + B²).

Let me compute that:

A² = 324² = let's see, 324 is 18², so 324² is (18²)² = 18^4 = but maybe just calculate it.

324*324: 300² is 90,000, 24² is 576, and cross terms 2*300*24=14,400. So (300 +24)^2 = 90,000 +14,400 +576= 104,976.

Similarly, B² = (-432)^2 = 432². Let's compute that:

400² = 160,000, 32²=1,024, and cross term 2*400*32=25,600. So (400 +32)^2=160,000 +25,600 +1,024=186,624.

So, A² + B² = 104,976 +186,624 = 291,600.

So, sqrt(291,600) = let's see. 540² is 291,600 because 500²=250,000, 40²=1,600, and cross terms 2*500*40=40,000. So (500 +40)^2=500² +2*500*40 +40²=250,000 +40,000 +1,600=291,600. So yes, sqrt(291,600)=540.

Therefore, the maximum value of Re is 540.

Wait, is that right? Because Re = A cosθ + B sinθ, which can be written as C cos(θ - φ), where C is the amplitude. The maximum value is then C, which is 540.

Wait, but
