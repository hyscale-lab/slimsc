Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. They're all positive real numbers, which is good because logarithms of non-positive numbers aren't defined. The problem gives me three equations involving logarithms base 2, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), then express that as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and finally find m + n.

Let me write down the equations:

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

I need to solve for x, y, z and then compute |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

Hmm, maybe I can rewrite these logarithmic equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

So, rewriting each equation:

1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)
2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)
3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)

Let me denote these as equations (1), (2), and (3) respectively.

So, equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z
Equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z
Equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y

This looks like a system of equations where each variable is expressed in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute them into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me try to express all variables in terms of one variable, say x, then solve for x first.

From equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z. Let me solve for y in terms of x and z.

Wait, maybe it's better to express y and z in terms of x.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z. So, if I can express z in terms of x, I can substitute into equation (3).

From equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y. But from equation (2), y is 2^(1/3) x z. So substitute that into equation (3):

z = 2^(1/4) * x * [2^(1/3) x z] = 2^(1/4 + 1/3) * x^2 z

Simplify the exponents: 1/4 + 1/3 is... let me compute that.

1/4 is 3/12, 1/3 is 4/12, so together it's 7/12. So,

z = 2^(7/12) x^2 z

Hmm, so z = 2^(7/12) x^2 z. Let's subtract 2^(7/12) x^2 z from both sides:

z - 2^(7/12) x^2 z = 0

Factor out z:

z (1 - 2^(7/12) x^2) = 0

But z is a positive real number, so z ≠ 0. Therefore:

1 - 2^(7/12) x^2 = 0

Which implies:

2^(7/12) x^2 = 1

So, x^2 = 2^(-7/12)

Taking square roots, since x is positive:

x = 2^(-7/24)

Wait, because sqrt(2^(-7/12)) = 2^(-7/24). Right.

Now that I have x, I can find y and z.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z

But I need z in terms of x. Let's use equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y

But since y is expressed in terms of x and z, this might get circular. Maybe substitute x into equation (1) or (2).

Wait, perhaps it's better to express y and z in terms of x, and then plug back into one of the equations.

But let me see: I have x = 2^(-7/24). Let me compute 2^(-7/24) as (2^(1/24))^(-7) or something, but maybe it's better to keep it as is for now.

Let me go back to equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) y z

We have x = 2^(-7/24), so:

2^(-7/24) = 2^(1/2) y z

Divide both sides by 2^(1/2):

y z = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(1/2) = 2^(-7/24 - 12/24) = 2^(-19/24)

So, y z = 2^(-19/24). Let's keep that in mind.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) x z

We know x is 2^(-7/24), so:

y = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-7/24) * z = 2^(8/24 - 7/24) * z = 2^(1/24) z

So, y = 2^(1/24) z

Now, we can substitute this into y z = 2^(-19/24):

(2^(1/24) z) * z = 2^(-19/24)

So, 2^(1/24) z^2 = 2^(-19/24)

Divide both sides by 2^(1/24):

z^2 = 2^(-19/24 - 1/24) = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6)

Taking square roots, since z is positive:

z = 2^(-5/12)

Now that we have z, we can find y from y = 2^(1/24) z

So,

y = 2^(1/24) * 2^(-5/12)

Convert 5/12 to 10/24 to have a common denominator:

y = 2^(1/24 - 10/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8)

So, y = 2^(-3/8)

Now, let's recap:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8)

z = 2^(-5/12)

Let me check if these values satisfy all three original equations.

First, equation (1): x/(y z) should equal 2^(1/2)

Compute x/(y z):

x = 2^(-7/24), y=2^(-3/8), z=2^(-5/12)

So, y z = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-3/8 -5/12)

Convert to 24 denominator:

-3/8 = -9/24, -5/12 = -10/24, so total is -19/24.

Thus, x/(y z) = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(-19/24) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2). Which matches equation (1). Good.

Equation (2): y/(x z) should be 2^(1/3)

Compute y/(x z):

y = 2^(-3/8), x z = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-7/24 -10/24) = 2^(-17/24)

So, y/(x z) = 2^(-3/8) / 2^(-17/24) = 2^(-9/24 +17/24) = 2^(8/24) = 2^(1/3). Correct.

Equation (3): z/(x y) should be 2^(1/4)

Compute z/(x y):

z = 2^(-5/12), x y = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-7/24 -9/24) = 2^(-16/24) = 2^(-2/3)

So, z/(x y) = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(-2/3) = 2^(-5/12 +8/12) = 2^(3/12) = 2^(1/4). Correct.

Okay, so the values of x, y, z are correct.

Now, the next step is to compute log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2). Let's compute that.

First, let me write x, y, z in exponent form:

x = 2^(-7/24) → x^4 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/24 *4) = 2^(-7/6)

y = 2^(-3/8) → y^3 = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)

z = 2^(-5/12) → z^2 = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-5/6)

Multiply all together: x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)

Combine the exponents:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6

First, convert all to 24 denominator:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Adding them up: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

So, x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-75/24) = 2^(-25/8) because 75 divided by 3 is 25, 24 divided by 3 is 8.

Wait, 75 divided by 3 is 25, 24 divided by 3 is 8. So, yes, 75/24 reduces to 25/8. Thus,

x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-25/8)

So, log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8

But the problem asks for |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|, which is | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So, the value is 25/8. Are 25 and 8 coprime? Yes, since 25 is 5^2 and 8 is 2^3, so no common factors.

Thus, m = 25, n = 8. Therefore, m + n = 25 +8 =33.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent calculations.

Let me double-check:

x = 2^(-7/24), so x^4 = 2^(-7/24 *4) = 2^(-7/6)

y = 2^(-3/8), so y^3 = 2^(-3/8 *3)= 2^(-9/8)

z = 2^(-5/12), so z^2 = 2^(-5/12 *2) = 2^(-5/6)

Total exponent: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6

Let me compute each term:

-7/6 = -14/12

-9/8 = -13.5/12 (wait, maybe better to find a common denominator. 24 is the LCD.

So:

-7/6 = (-7 *4)/24 = -28/24

-9/8 = (-9 *3)/24 = -27/24

-5/6 = (-5 *4)/24 = -20/24

Adding: (-28 -27 -20) = (-75)/24 → which is -25/8 when reduced. So, yes, correct.

Thus, log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -25/8, absolute value is 25/8. So, m/n is 25/8, m + n is 33.


To solve the given system of logarithmic equations, we first convert each equation to its exponential form:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\) implies \(\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\).
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\) implies \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\).
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\) implies \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\).

Rewriting these, we get:
1. \(x = 2^{1/2} \cdot yz\)
2. \(y = 2^{1/3} \cdot xz\)
3. \(z = 2^{1/4} \cdot xy\)

Substituting \(y\) from equation (2) into equation (3):
\[ z = 2^{1/4} \cdot x \cdot (2^{1/3} \cdot xz) = 2^{7/12} \cdot x^2 z \]
Solving for \(z\), we find:
\[ z = 2^{-5/12} \]

Using \(z\) in equation (2) to find \(y\):
\[ y = 2^{1/24} \cdot z = 2^{-3/8} \]

Finally, using \(y\) and \(z\) in equation (1) to find \(x\):
\[ x = 2^{-7/24} \]

Next, we compute \(\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\):
\[
\begin{align*}
x^4 &= (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-7/6}, \\
y^3 &= (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8}, \\
z^2 &= (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-5/6}.
\end{align*}
\]
Multiplying these together:
\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-7/6} \cdot 2^{-9/8} \cdot 2^{-5/6} = 2^{-75/24} = 2^{-25/8}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -\frac{25}{8}.
\]
Taking the absolute value, we get \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right| = \frac{25}{8}\). Since 25 and 8 are coprime, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), giving \(m + n = 33\).

\(\boxed{33}\)
