Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a tetrahedron. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. We need to find this distance, which can be written as m*sqrt(n)/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, compute m + n + p.

Hmm, okay. So this point I is equidistant from all four faces of the tetrahedron. I remember that in a tetrahedron, such a point is called the incenter, analogous to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius.

So, the problem reduces to finding the inradius of this tetrahedron. I think the formula for the inradius (r) is given by r = 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area (the sum of the areas of all four faces). So, I need to find the volume V and the surface area S of this tetrahedron.

But wait, before I proceed, I should check if this tetrahedron is isohedral or something like that because the edges come in equal pairs. Let me list the edges:

AB = CD = sqrt(41)
AC = BD = sqrt(80)
BC = AD = sqrt(89)

So, each pair of opposite edges are equal. That might imply some symmetry. Maybe the tetrahedron is symmetric in a way that allows for easier computation of its properties.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the tetrahedron in 3D space. Maybe by placing the points in a coordinate system such that the calculations are manageable.

I think placing the points smartly in a coordinate system might help. Let me try that approach.

Let me assign coordinates to the vertices in such a way that simplifies the calculations. Let's say point A is at (0, 0, 0). Then, because of the equal opposite edges, maybe point C is at (x, y, 0), and point B is at (a, 0, 0), and point D is at (b, c, d). Hmm, not sure if this is the best approach, but let me try.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way. Since opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron is such that it's symmetric with respect to some plane or maybe it's a kind of "kite" tetrahedron. Alternatively, maybe it's a disphenoid, which is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. Yes, I think that's the term. So, this is a disphenoid because all opposite edges are equal.

I remember that in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, is that true? Let me think. If all opposite edges are equal, then each face is a triangle with sides of lengths sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, actually, all faces are congruent triangles. Therefore, each face has the same area. That makes things easier because then the surface area S will be 4 times the area of one face.

So, first, let's compute the area of one face. Each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Wait, let me verify that. Let's pick face ABC: AB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), and BC = sqrt(89). Similarly, each face has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), so they are all congruent.

Therefore, the area of each face is the same, so if I compute the area of one face, I can multiply by four to get the total surface area.

So, let's compute the area of triangle ABC with sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89). I can use Heron's formula for this.

Heron's formula says that the area is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter: s = (a + b + c)/2.

First, compute s:

s = [sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)] / 2

Hmm, but this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way since the sides are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Wait, let me compute a^2, b^2, c^2:

a^2 = 41, b^2 = 80, c^2 = 89.

Wait, 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11^2, but c^2 is 89, which is less than 121. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe the triangle is right-angled? Let's check.

In a right-angled triangle, a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where c is the longest side.

Check if 41 + 80 = 121 equals 89? No, 41 + 80 is 121, which is not 89. So, not a right-angled triangle. So, Heron's formula is the way to go.

But dealing with square roots is going to be messy. Maybe I can compute s, s - a, etc., symbolically.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the area using vectors or coordinates once I assign coordinates to the points.

Wait, maybe I can place the points in such a way that the tetrahedron is symmetric, which would make computing the volume easier.

Let me try placing point A at (0, 0, 0), point B at (x, 0, 0), point C at (p, q, 0), and point D at (r, s, t). But this might get complicated. Alternatively, since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron has a center of symmetry.

Wait, in a disphenoid, the midpoints of the three pairs of opposite edges all coincide at the centroid of the tetrahedron. So, the centroid is equidistant from all four vertices. Hmm, that might help in computing the inradius.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the volume using the formula for a disphenoid. I recall that in a disphenoid, the volume can be computed with the formula V = (sqrt[(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)]) / 72. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, I think the volume can be found using the formula involving the edges and the Cayley-Menger determinant.

Yes, the Cayley-Menger determinant is a formula that gives the volume of a tetrahedron based on the lengths of its edges. Since we have all the edge lengths, this might be the way to go.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a^2  b^2  c^2 |
| 1  a^2  0    d^2  e^2 |
| 1  b^2 d^2   0    f^2 |
| 1  c^2 e^2  f^2   0  |

So, let me construct this matrix for our tetrahedron.

Given the edge lengths:

AB = sqrt(41) => a^2 = 41
AC = sqrt(80) => b^2 = 80
AD = sqrt(89) => c^2 = 89
BC = sqrt(89) => d^2 = 89
BD = sqrt(80) => e^2 = 80
CD = sqrt(41) => f^2 = 41

So, the Cayley-Menger matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89
Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80
Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41
Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, no, hold on. Let me make sure I'm putting the right values. The matrix is 5x5, with the first row and column being 0,1,1,1,1 and then the other entries are the squares of the edge lengths.

Wait, wait, perhaps I need to correct the order of the points. In the Cayley-Menger determinant, the points are ordered as A, B, C, D. So, the edges are AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD.

So, the edge lengths as per the problem:

AB = sqrt(41) => a = sqrt(41)
AC = sqrt(80) => b = sqrt(80)
AD = sqrt(89) => c = sqrt(89)
BC = sqrt(89) => d = sqrt(89)
BD = sqrt(80) => e = sqrt(80)
CD = sqrt(41) => f = sqrt(41)

So, the entries in the Cayley-Menger determinant matrix are:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, (AB)^2, (AC)^2, (AD)^2 => 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, (AB)^2, 0, (BC)^2, (BD)^2 => 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, (AC)^2, (BC)^2, 0, (CD)^2 => 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, (AD)^2, (BD)^2, (CD)^2, 0 => 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

So, the matrix is:

0 1 1 1 1

1 0 41 80 89

1 41 0 89 80

1 80 89 0 41

1 89 80 41 0

Now, I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix, which will give me CM. Then V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ). 

Calculating a 5x5 determinant manually is quite tedious, but perhaps I can notice some patterns or symmetries that can help me compute it.

Looking at the matrix, I can see that it's symmetric, which might make things easier.

Alternatively, perhaps I can perform row or column operations to simplify the determinant. Let me think.

First, let's write down the matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Hmm, perhaps subtracting Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4, and 5 might help. Wait, in a 5x5 matrix, indices go from 0 to 4. Wait, but in standard linear algebra, matrices are 1-based sometimes, but here it's 0-based. Maybe I should index it as rows 0 to 4.

Wait, perhaps if I subtract Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4. Let's see.

Wait, Rows 2, 3, 4 are the same as Row 1 but rotated. Maybe the determinant has some properties due to this symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the determinant can be factored or has some symmetry that allows it to be simplified.

Alternatively, since the Cayley-Menger determinant is known for a disphenoid, which this is, maybe there's a formula for it.

Wait, a quick search in my mind: for a disphenoid, the Cayley-Menger determinant can be expressed in terms of the edge lengths. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the volume in terms of the edge lengths when it's a disphenoid.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron when it's a disphenoid. Let me think.

In a disphenoid, all faces are congruent triangles. So, each face has the same area, which is sqrt(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)), where a, b, c are the sides. Since all the faces are congruent, maybe the volume can be expressed in terms of the area of the face and some other parameter.

Wait, but I think I should proceed with the Cayley-Menger determinant, even though it's a bit involved.

Let me denote the matrix as M:

M = [
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 0, 41, 80, 89],
[1, 41, 0, 89, 80],
[1, 80, 89, 0, 41],
[1, 89, 80, 41, 0]
]

I need to compute det(M). Hmm, perhaps I can use some properties of determinants or look for patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps I can expand the determinant along the first row since it has a zero which might simplify things.

The determinant of M is equal to the sum over the first row of (-1)^(i+j) * M[i,j] * det(M_ij), where M_ij is the minor matrix.

So, expanding along the first row (i=0):

det(M) = 0 * det(M_00) - 1 * det(M_01) + 1 * det(M_02) - 1 * det(M_03) + 1 * det(M_04)

But since the first element is 0, that term drops out. So:

det(M) = (-1)^{0+1} * 1 * det(M_01) + (-1)^{0+2} * 1 * det(M_02) + (-1)^{0+3} * 1 * det(M_03) + (-1)^{0+4} * 1 * det(M_04)

Which is:

det(M) = (-1)^{1} * det(M_01) + (+1) * det(M_02) + (-1) * det(M_03) + (+1) * det(M_04)

So,

det(M) = -det(M_01) + det(M_02) - det(M_03) + det(M_04)

Now, let's find each minor M_0j.

Each minor M_0j is the determinant of the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing row 0 and column j.

So, for j=1, column 1 is removed:

M_01 is:

Row 1: 1, 0, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 41, 0

Wait, no. Let me correct that.

Wait, when we remove row 0 and column 1, the remaining columns are 0,2,3,4. So, the entries are:

Row 1: [1, 41, 80, 89] becomes [1, 80, 89] (since column 1 is removed?) Wait, no. Wait, the initial matrix is 5x5, with columns 0 to 4. When we remove column 1, the remaining columns are 0,2,3,4. So, for M_01, the first row (row 1) is [1, 41, 80, 89], but removing column 1 gives [1, 80, 89].

Wait, perhaps I should write it step by step.

Original M after removing row 0 and column j (for j=1):

The remaining rows are 1,2,3,4; the remaining columns are 0,2,3,4.

So, for M_01 (j=1):

Row 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89] becomes [1, 41, 80, 89] (columns 0,2,3,4)
Row 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80] becomes [1, 0, 89, 80]
Row 3: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41] becomes [1, 89, 0, 41]
Row 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0] becomes [1, 80, 41, 0]

So, M_01 is:

1 41 80 89

1 0 89 80

1 89 0 41

1 80 41 0

Similarly, for M_02 (j=2), we remove column 2:

So, the remaining columns are 0,1,3,4.

So, M_02:

Row 1: [1, 0, 80, 89]
Row 2: [1,41, 89,80]
Row 3: [1,80,0,41]
Row 4: [1,89,41,0]

Wait, let me verify:

Row 1: original [1,0,41,80,89] becomes [1,0,80,89] (columns 0,1,3,4)
Row 2: [1,41,0,89,80] becomes [1,41,89,80]
Row 3: [1,80,89,0,41] becomes [1,80,0,41]
Row 4: [1,89,80,41,0] becomes [1,89,41,0]

So, M_02 is:

1 0 80 89

1 41 89 80

1 80 0 41

1 89 41 0

Similarly, for M_03 (j=3):

Remove column 3, so columns 0,1,2,4.

Thus:

Row 1: [1,0,41,89]
Row 2: [1,41,0,80]
Row 3: [1,80,89,41]
Row 4: [1,89,80,0]

Wait, let me see:

Row 1: [1,0,41,80,89] becomes [1,0,41,89] (columns 0,1,2,4)
Row 2: [1,41,0,89,80] becomes [1,41,0,80]
Row 3: [1,80,89,0,41] becomes [1,80,89,41]
Row 4: [1,89,80,41,0] becomes [1,89,80,0]

Thus, M_03 is:

1 0 41 89

1 41 0 80

1 80 89 41

1 89 80 0

Similarly, M_04 (j=4) is the minor after removing column 4.

So, columns 0,1,2,3.

Row 1: [1,0,41,80]
Row 2: [1,41,0,89]
Row 3: [1,80,89,0]
Row 4: [1,89,80,41]

Wait, let me check:

Row 1: [1,0,41,80,89] becomes [1,0,41,80]
Row 2: [1,41,0,89,80] becomes [1,41,0,89]
Row 3: [1,80,89,0,41] becomes [1,80,89,0]
Row 4: [1,89,80,41,0] becomes [1,89,80,41]

So, M_04 is:

1 0 41 80

1 41 0 89

1 80 89 0

1 89 80 41

Hmm, okay. Now, I need to compute the determinants of these four 4x4 matrices, which is still a lot, but perhaps some of them have patterns.

Looking at M_01 and M_04, they seem to be similar but with some elements swapped. Similarly, M_02 and M_03 might have some patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute one of them and see if the others have similar properties.

Let me attempt to compute det(M_01). The matrix M_01 is:

1 41 80 89

1 0 89 80

1 89 0 41

1 80 41 0

Hmm, let's write this as a 4x4 matrix:

Row 1: 1, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 80, 41, 0

I need to compute the determinant of this. Maybe using expansion by minors or row operations.

Alternatively, perhaps subtracting rows to create zeros.

Let me subtract Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4.

So, new Row 2 = Row 2 - Row 1:

Row 2: 1-1, 0-41, 89-80, 80-89 => 0, -41, 9, -9

Row 3: 1-1, 89-41, 0-80, 41-89 => 0, 48, -80, -48

Row 4: 1-1, 80-41, 41-80, 0-89 => 0, 39, -39, -89

So, the matrix becomes:

Row 1: 1, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 0, -41, 9, -9

Row 3: 0, 48, -80, -48

Row 4: 0, 39, -39, -89

Now, the determinant remains the same after these operations because we subtracted rows. Now, maybe I can compute the determinant by expanding along the first column since it has three zeros.

The determinant is:

1 * det(minor at 1,1) - 0 + 0 - 0.

So, the determinant is equal to the determinant of the minor at (1,1), which is the 3x3 matrix:

-41, 9, -9

48, -80, -48

39, -39, -89

So, now compute this 3x3 determinant.

Let me write it out:

| -41   9    -9  |
| 48  -80   -48 |
| 39  -39   -89 |

Compute this determinant:

Using the rule of Sarrus or expansion.

I'll expand along the first row.

det = (-41) * det[ (-80, -48), (-39, -89) ] - 9 * det[ (48, -48), (39, -89) ] + (-9) * det[ (48, -80), (39, -39) ]

Compute each minor:

First minor: det[ (-80, -48), (-39, -89) ] = (-80)*(-89) - (-48)*(-39) = 7120 - 1872 = 7120 - 1872 = 5248

Second minor: det[ (48, -48), (39, -89) ] = 48*(-89) - (-48)*39 = -4272 + 1872 = -2400

Third minor: det[ (48, -80), (39, -39) ] = 48*(-39) - (-80)*39 = -1872 + 3120 = 1248

So, putting it together:

det = (-41)*5248 - 9*(-2400) + (-9)*1248

Compute each term:

First term: (-41)*5248 = let's compute 41 * 5248.

41 * 5000 = 205000

41 * 248 = 41*(200 + 48) = 8200 + 1968 = 10168

So, 41*5248 = 205000 + 10168 = 215168. Since it's multiplied by -1, it's -215168.

Second term: -9*(-2400) = +21600

Third term: (-9)*1248 = -11232

So, total det = -215168 + 21600 - 11232

Compute:

-215168 + 21600 = -193568

-193568 -11232 = -204800

So, the determinant of the minor is -204800.

Therefore, the determinant of M_01 is (-1)^{1+1} * (-204800) ? Wait, no. Wait, earlier I had det(M_01) being the determinant of this minor, which was computed as -204800.

Wait, no. Let me recap. When I computed the 3x3 determinant, it was -204800. So, the minor M_01's determinant is -204800.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The minor M_01 is a 4x4 matrix, and after row operations, its determinant was reduced to the 3x3 determinant which was -204800. So, det(M_01) = -204800.

Wait, no, wait. The 4x4 determinant was transformed into the 3x3 determinant, which was -204800. So, the determinant of M_01 is -204800.

Wait, no. The 4x4 determinant, after subtracting rows, became a matrix where the first column is [1,0,0,0], so the determinant is equal to the determinant of the 3x3 minor. So, yes, det(M_01) is -204800.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. When I did the row operations, I only subtracted Row 1 from Rows 2,3,4, which doesn't change the determinant. So, the determinant of the transformed matrix is the same as the original. Then, expanding along the first column gives the same determinant as the minor. So, det(M_01) is indeed equal to -204800.

Hmm, okay. Now, moving on to det(M_02). Let me see what M_02 looks like.

M_02 is:

1 0 80 89

1 41 89 80

1 80 0 41

1 89 41 0

Again, perhaps similar approach: subtract Row 1 from Rows 2,3,4.

So, Row 2 becomes Row2 - Row1:

1-1=0, 41-0=41, 89-80=9, 80-89=-9

Row3: 1-1=0, 80-0=80, 0-80=-80, 41-89=-48

Row4: 1-1=0, 89-0=89, 41-80=-39, 0-89=-89

So, transformed M_02 is:

Row1: 1, 0, 80, 89

Row2: 0, 41, 9, -9

Row3: 0, 80, -80, -48

Row4: 0, 89, -39, -89

Now, expand along the first column:

det(M_02) = 1 * det(minor at 1,1)

The minor is the 3x3 matrix:

41, 9, -9

80, -80, -48

89, -39, -89

Compute this determinant.

Again, expand along the first row:

= 41 * det[ (-80, -48), (-39, -89) ] - 9 * det[ (80, -48), (89, -89) ] + (-9) * det[ (80, -80), (89, -39) ]

Compute each minor:

First minor: det[ (-80, -48), (-39, -89) ] = (-80)*(-89) - (-48)*(-39) = 7120 - 1872 = 5248

Second minor: det[ (80, -48), (89, -89) ] = 80*(-89) - (-48)*89 = -7120 + 4272 = -2848

Third minor: det[ (80, -80), (89, -39) ] = 80*(-39) - (-80)*89 = -3120 + 7120 = 4000

So, putting it together:

det = 41*5248 - 9*(-2848) + (-9)*4000

Compute each term:

41 * 5248: same as before, 215168

-9*(-2848) = +25632

-9*4000 = -36000

So, total det = 215168 + 25632 - 36000

Compute step by step:

215168 + 25632 = 240800

240800 - 36000 = 204800

So, determinant is 204800.

Therefore, det(M_02) is 204800.

Hmm, interesting. So, det(M_01) is -204800 and det(M_02) is +204800. 

Now, moving on to det(M_03). Let's see what M_03 looks like.

M_03 is:

1 0 41 89

1 41 0 80

1 80 89 41

1 89 80 0

Again, perhaps perform row operations. Subtract Row1 from Rows2,3,4.

Row2: 1-1=0, 41-0=41, 0-41=-41, 80-89=-9

Row3: 1-1=0, 80-0=80, 89-41=48, 41-89=-48

Row4: 1-1=0, 89-0=89, 80-41=39, 0-89=-89

So, the transformed M_03 is:

Row1: 1, 0, 41, 89

Row2: 0, 41, -41, -9

Row3: 0, 80, 48, -48

Row4: 0, 89, 39, -89

Now, expand along the first column:

det(M_03) = 1 * det(minor at 1,1)

Minor is the 3x3 matrix:

41, -41, -9

80, 48, -48

89, 39, -89

Compute this determinant.

Again, expanding along the first row:

= 41 * det[ (48, -48), (39, -89) ] - (-41) * det[ (80, -48), (89, -89) ] + (-9) * det[ (80, 48), (89, 39) ]

Compute each minor:

First minor: det[ (48, -48), (39, -89) ] = 48*(-89) - (-48)*39 = -4272 + 1872 = -2400

Second minor: det[ (80, -48), (89, -89) ] = 80*(-89) - (-48)*89 = -7120 + 4272 = -2848

Third minor: det[ (80, 48), (89, 39) ] = 80*39 - 48*89 = 3120 - 4272 = -1152

So, putting it together:

det = 41*(-2400) - (-41)*(-2848) + (-9)*(-1152)

Compute each term:

41*(-2400) = -98400

-41*(-2848) = +116768

-9*(-1152) = +10368

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, the second term is - (-41) * det(...) which is +41 * det(...). But det(...) is -2848, so +41*(-2848) = -116768.

Wait, let me correct:

Expression is:

= 41*(-2400) - (-41)*(-2848) + (-9)*(-1152)

= 41*(-2400) -41*(2848) + 9*(1152)

So:

= (-98400) - (41*2848) + 10368

Compute 41*2848:

Compute 40*2848 = 113920

1*2848=2848

Total: 113920 + 2848 = 116768

So,

= (-98400) - 116768 + 10368

Compute:

-98400 -116768 = -215168

-215168 + 10368 = -204800

So, the determinant is -204800.

Therefore, det(M_03) = -204800.

Finally, let's compute det(M_04). Let's look at M_04:

M_04 is:

1 0 41 80

1 41 0 89

1 80 89 0

1 89 80 41

Again, let's subtract Row1 from Rows2,3,4.

Row2: 1-1=0,41-0=41,0-41=-41,89-80=9

Row3:1-1=0,80-0=80,89-41=48,0-80=-80

Row4:1-1=0,89-0=89,80-41=39,41-80=-39

So, transformed M_04 is:

Row1: 1, 0, 41, 80

Row2: 0,41,-41,9

Row3:0,80,48,-80

Row4:0,89,39,-39

Now, expand along the first column:

det(M_04) = 1 * det(minor at 1,1)

The minor is:

41, -41, 9

80, 48, -80

89, 39, -39

Compute this determinant.

Again, expanding along the first row:

=41 * det[ (48, -80), (39, -39) ] - (-41) * det[ (80, -80), (89, -39) ] +9 * det[ (80, 48), (89, 39) ]

Compute each minor:

First minor: det[ (48, -80), (39, -39) ] = 48*(-39) - (-80)*39 = -1872 + 3120 = 1248

Second minor: det[ (80, -80), (89, -39) ] = 80*(-39) - (-80)*89 = -3120 + 7120 = 4000

Third minor: det[ (80, 48), (89, 39) ] = 80*39 - 48*89 = 3120 - 4272 = -1152

So, putting it together:

det = 41*1248 - (-41)*4000 +9*(-1152)

Compute each term:

41*1248: Let's compute 40*1248=49920, plus 1*1248=1248 → total 51168

- (-41)*4000 = +41*4000=164000

9*(-1152)= -10368

So, total det = 51168 + 164000 -10368

Compute:

51168 + 164000 = 215168

215168 -10368 = 204800

So, determinant is 204800.

Therefore, det(M_04) = 204800.

Alright, now compiling all determinants:

det(M_01) = -204800

det(M_02) = +204800

det(M_03) = -204800

det(M_04) = +204800

So, putting back into the determinant formula:

det(M) = -det(M_01) + det(M_02) - det(M_03) + det(M_04)

= -(-204800) + 204800 - (-204800) + 204800

Compute term by term:

-(-204800) = +204800

+204800

-(-204800) = +204800

+204800

So, adding all together: 204800 + 204800 + 204800 + 204800 = 819200

Wait, 204800 *4 = 819200.

So, det(M) = 819200.

But wait, I thought the formula was Volume = sqrt( |det(M)| / 288 ). So, let's plug that in.

Volume V = sqrt( |819200| / 288 )

Compute inside the sqrt:

819200 / 288 = ?

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 16:

819200 ÷16= 51200

288 ÷16=18

So, 51200 / 18 = 25600 / 9

So, sqrt(25600 / 9 ) = sqrt(25600)/sqrt(9) = 160 / 3

So, Volume V = 160 / 3

Alright, so the volume is 160/3.

Next, I need to compute the total surface area S.

Since all four faces are congruent triangles, each with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), as we saw earlier.

So, compute the area of one face and multiply by 4.

Let's compute the area using Heron's formula.

Compute the semi-perimeter s:

s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2

Wait, but this seems messy. Alternatively, since we have a disphenoid, maybe all faces have the same area, which we can compute using another formula.

Alternatively, since the edges are given, maybe I can compute the area using vectors or coordinates.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the area using Heron's formula.

But dealing with square roots is a bit of a pain. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the area squared, which might be manageable.

Wait, let me try to compute the area of one face.

Let me denote the sides as a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).

Compute s = (a + b + c)/2.

But perhaps instead, I can compute the area using the formula:

Area = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )

But that's essentially Heron's formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the area using another method, like the cross product if I can assign coordinates.

Wait, since I assigned coordinates to the points earlier, perhaps I can compute the vectors and then find the area.

Wait, but I didn't assign specific coordinates yet. Maybe I can do that now.

Wait, given that this is a disphenoid, perhaps I can assign coordinates in such a way that it's symmetric.

Let me consider placing the points as follows:

Let me place point A at (x, y, z)

Point B at (-x, -y, z)

Point C at (-x, y, -z)

Point D at (x, -y, -z)

This is a symmetric placement which I think is typical for a disphenoid.

So, with this symmetry, the opposite edges are equal, and the midpoints coincide.

So, now, the distances between the points can be used to find x, y, z.

Compute AB: distance between A(x,y,z) and B(-x,-y,z)

AB^2 = (x + x)^2 + (y + y)^2 + (z - z)^2 = (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0 = 4x² + 4y² = (2sqrt(x² + y²))²

Given AB = sqrt(41), so AB² = 41.

Thus, 4x² + 4y² = 41 → x² + y² = 41/4.

Similarly, compute AC: distance between A(x,y,z) and C(-x, y, -z)

AC² = (x + x)^2 + (y - y)^2 + (z + z)^2 = (2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2 = 4x² + 4z²

Given AC = sqrt(80), so AC² = 80 → 4x² +4z² =80 → x² + z² = 20.

Similarly, compute AD: distance between A(x,y,z) and D(x, -y, -z)

AD² = (x -x)^2 + (y + y)^2 + (z + z)^2 = 0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 = 4y² +4z²

Given AD = sqrt(89), so AD² =89 → 4y² +4z² =89 → y² + z² =89/4.

So, now we have three equations:

1. x² + y² = 41/4

2. x² + z² = 20

3. y² + z² = 89/4

We can solve for x², y², z².

Let me denote:

Equation 1: x² + y² = 41/4

Equation 2: x² + z² = 20

Equation 3: y² + z² = 89/4

Let me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3:

(y² + z²) - (x² + y²) = (89/4) - (41/4)

Simplify: z² - x² = (48/4) =12

From Equation 2: x² + z² = 20

Let me denote z² - x² =12 and x² + z²=20.

We can solve these two equations for x² and z².

Let me add the two equations:

(z² -x²) + (x² + z²) =12 +20 → 2z² =32 → z²=16 → z=4 or -4.

Then, from Equation 2: x² +16=20 →x²=4 →x=2 or -2.

From Equation 1: x² + y²=41/4 →4 + y²=41/4 → y²=41/4 -16/4=25/4 → y=5/2 or -5/2.

So, x=±2, y=±5/2, z=±4.

Given the symmetric placement, I can choose x=2, y=5/2, z=4.

So, points are:

A: (2, 5/2, 4)

B: (-2, -5/2, 4)

C: (-2, 5/2, -4)

D: (2, -5/2, -4)

Now, with these coordinates, I can compute the area of a face.

Let's pick face ABC.

Compute vectors AB and AC.

Point A: (2, 5/2, 4)

Point B: (-2, -5/2, 4)

Point C: (-2, 5/2, -4)

Vector AB = B - A = (-2-2, -5/2 -5/2, 4-4) = (-4, -5, 0)

Vector AC = C - A = (-2-2, 5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (-4, 0, -8)

Compute the cross product AB × AC.

AB = (-4, -5, 0)

AC = (-4, 0, -8)

Cross product:

|i     j     k|
|-4   -5     0|
|-4    0    -8|

= i [ (-5)(-8) - 0*0 ] - j [ (-4)(-8) - 0*(-4) ] + k [ (-4)(0) - (-5)(-4) ]

= i [40 - 0] - j [32 - 0] + k [0 - 20]

= (40, -32, -20)

The magnitude of this cross product is sqrt(40² + (-32)² + (-20)²) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024)

Simplify sqrt(3024):

Factor 3024:

Divide by 16: 3024 /16=189.

So, sqrt(3024)=sqrt(16*189)=4*sqrt(189)

Factor 189: 189=9*21=9*3*7=3^3 *7.

So, sqrt(189)=sqrt(9*21)=3*sqrt(21).

So, sqrt(3024)=4*3*sqrt(21)=12*sqrt(21).

Thus, the magnitude of AB × AC is 12√21.

The area of triangle ABC is half of this: (12√21)/2=6√21.

So, each face has area 6√21.

Since there are four faces, the total surface area S=4*6√21=24√21.

Now, compute the inradius r= 3V / S.

We have V=160/3 and S=24√21.

So,

r= 3*(160/3) / (24√21) = (160) / (24√21) = (20)/3√21.

Simplify:

r=20/(3√21). Rationalizing the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by √21:

r= (20√21)/(3*21)= (20√21)/(63)

So, r=20√21/63.

Simplify the fraction: 20 and 63 are coprime? Let's see. 20 factors: 2^2 *5. 63:7*3^2. No common factors. So, yes, 20/63 is reduced.

So, m=20, n=21, p=63.

Wait, but 20 and 63 have a common factor? 20 and 63 are coprime since 20 is 2^2*5 and 63 is 7*3^2; no common primes.

Wait, but 21 is square-free? Yes, 21=3*7, no square factors.

So, the distance is (20√21)/63, so m=20, n=21, p=63.

So, m +n +p=20+21+63=104.

Wait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, when I computed the cross product of AB and AC, I got (40, -32, -20). Let me verify that.

AB = (-4, -5, 0)

AC = (-4, 0, -8)

Cross product:

i component: (-5)(-8) - 0*0 =40

j component: - [ (-4)(-8) - 0*(-4) ] = - [32 -0] = -32

k component: (-4)(0) - (-5)(-4) =0 -20 =-20

Yes, correct. So, cross product is (40, -32, -20). Its magnitude squared is 40^2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2=1600+1024+400=3024.

sqrt(3024)=sqrt(16*189)=4*sqrt(189)=4*3*sqrt(21)=12√21. So, area is 6√21. Correct.

Surface area is 4*6√21=24√21. Correct.

Volume is 160/3. Correct.

Inradius r=3V/S = 3*(160/3)/(24√21)= 160/(24√21)= (20)/(3√21)=20√21/(3*21)=20√21/63. Correct.

So, m=20, n=21, p=63. Sum is 20+21+63=104.

Wait, but the problem statement says "the distances from I to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal." So, yes, that's the inradius.

Hmm, so the answer is 104.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{104}


Given a tetrahedron \(ABCD\) with specific edge lengths: \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\). We need to find the distance from the incenter \(I\) to each face, which is the inradius.

First, we recognize that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, meaning all faces are congruent triangles. The inradius \(r\) of a tetrahedron is given by \(r = \frac{3V}{S}\), where \(V\) is the volume and \(S\) is the total surface area.

To find the volume \(V\), we use the Cayley-Menger determinant. The determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix for the given edge lengths is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{det}(M) = 819200
\]

The volume \(V\) is then:

\[
V = \sqrt{\frac{|\text{det}(M)|}{288}} = \sqrt{\frac{819200}{288}} = \frac{160}{3}
\]

Next, we compute the surface area \(S\). Each face is a triangle with sides \(\sqrt{41}\), \(\sqrt{80}\), and \(\sqrt{89}\). Using Heron's formula, the area of one face is found to be \(6\sqrt{21}\). Since there are four congruent faces, the total surface area \(S\) is:

\[
S = 4 \times 6\sqrt{21} = 24\sqrt{21}
\]

The inradius \(r\) is calculated as:

\[
r = \frac{3V}{S} = \frac{3 \times \frac{160}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{160}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20}{3\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}
\]

Thus, the distance is \(\frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}\). The values \(m = 20\), \(n = 21\), and \(p = 63\) give us \(m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\).

\[
\boxed{104}
\]
