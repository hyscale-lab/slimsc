Okay, so I have this problem about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to wrap my head around it. The problem says that a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. My task is to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten such b-eautiful numbers.

Hmm, let's break this down. In base b, a two-digit number would be of the form d1 d0, right? Where d1 is the digit in the b's place and d0 is the units digit. So in decimal, that would be d1*b + d0. Since it's a two-digit number in base b, d1 can't be zero, and both digits d1 and d0 must be less than b.

The sum of the digits is d1 + d0, and this sum must equal sqrt(n). Since n is d1*b + d0, I can write the equation as d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1*b + d0). Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0.

Expanding the left side gives d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0.

Let me rearrange this equation to bring everything to one side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0.

Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of d0 or d1. Maybe I can treat this as a quadratic equation in one variable and see if I can find integer solutions.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about possible values of d1 and d0. Since both digits are less than b, and the number has two digits, d1 ranges from 1 to b-1, and d0 from 0 to b-1.

Wait, another approach: since d1 + d0 = sqrt(n), and n = d1*b + d0, substituting sqrt(n) gives d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1*b + d0). Let me denote s = d1 + d0, so s^2 = d1*b + d0.

So, s^2 = d1*b + d0. But d0 can be expressed as s - d1, since d0 = s - d1. So substituting that into the equation, we get:

s^2 = d1*b + (s - d1).

Which simplifies to s^2 = d1*(b - 1) + s.

Rearranging terms:

d1*(b - 1) = s^2 - s.

So, d1 = (s^2 - s) / (b - 1).

But d1 must be a positive integer since it's a digit in base b, so (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, since d1 must be at least 1 and at most b-1, that gives:

1 ≤ (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) ≤ b - 1.

Hmm, so for each s, we can find possible b's that satisfy this condition. But wait, actually, for a given b, we can find s, then compute d1 and d0.

Wait, maybe I should express it differently. Since d0 = s - d1, and both d0 and d1 are digits, d0 must be less than b. Therefore, s - d1 < b.

But d1 is (s^2 - s
