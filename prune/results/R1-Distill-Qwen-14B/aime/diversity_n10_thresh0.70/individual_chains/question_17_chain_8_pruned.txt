Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I need to express r squared as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and find p + q. 

Hmm, let me start by recalling some formulas about rectangular boxes. A rectangular box has length, width, and height, let's say a, b, c. The surface area S is given by 2(ab + bc + ac), and the volume V is given by abc. 

So, in this case, S = 54, so 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54, which simplifies to ab + bc + ac = 27. And the volume V = 23, so abc = 23. 

I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere must enclose the entire box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a rectangular box with sides a, b, c is given by d = sqrt(a² + b² + c²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, so r = d/2 = sqrt(a² + b² + c²)/2. 

So, my goal is to minimize the radius, which translates to minimizing the space diagonal, but wait, no, actually we need the maximum possible space diagonal over all boxes in B, because the sphere must contain all such boxes. Wait, no, wait. Actually, each box must fit inside the sphere, so the sphere must have a radius at least as big as the maximum space diagonal divided by 2 among all boxes in B. Or wait, actually, the sphere must contain each box, so the sphere must have a radius that is the maximum possible half-diagonal among all boxes in B. So, if I can find the maximum value of sqrt(a² + b² + c²)/2 for a, b, c satisfying ab + bc + ac = 27 and abc = 23, then that would be the minimal r.

Wait, no, perhaps I got that wrong. Wait, the sphere needs to contain each box in B, so for each box, the sphere must contain it. Therefore, the sphere must have a radius large enough to contain the box with the largest possible space diagonal. So, to find r, I need to find the maximum of sqrt(a² + b² + c²)/2 for all a, b, c with ab + bc + ac = 27 and abc = 23. Then, the minimal such r is that maximum value. So, the problem reduces to maximizing a² + b² + c² given those constraints.

So, the problem becomes an optimization problem: maximize a² + b² + c² subject to ab + bc + ac = 27 and abc = 23.

Hmm, how can I approach this? I can try using Lagrange multipliers since it's a constrained optimization problem.

Let me denote the function to maximize as f(a, b, c) = a² + b² + c².

The constraints are:

g(a, b, c) = ab + bc + ac - 27 = 0,

h(a, b, c) = abc - 23 = 0.

So, I need to set up the Lagrangian with two constraints. The Lagrangian would be:

L = a² + b² + c² - λ(ab + bc + ac - 27) - μ(abc - 23)

We can take partial derivatives with respect to a, b, c, set them to zero, and solve the system.

Let's compute the partial derivatives:

∂L/∂a = 2a - λ(b + c) - μ(bc) = 0

Similarly,

∂L/∂b = 2b - λ(a + c) - μ(ac) = 0

∂L/∂c = 2c - λ(a + b) - μ(ab) = 0

And we also have the constraints:

ab + bc + ac = 27,

abc = 23.

So, now we have a system of equations:

1. 2a - λ(b + c) - μ bc = 0

2. 2b - λ(a + c) - μ ac = 0

3. 2c - λ(a + b) - μ ab = 0

4. ab + bc + ac = 27

5. abc = 23

Hmm, this is a system of equations with variables a, b, c, λ, μ. It might be symmetric, so perhaps a = b = c? Wait, but let's see.

If a = b = c, then from ab + bc + ac
