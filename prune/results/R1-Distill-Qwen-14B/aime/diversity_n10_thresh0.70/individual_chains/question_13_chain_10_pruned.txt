Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem about Aya's morning walks. Let me read through it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop. She walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, and this walk takes her 4 hours in total. This 4 hours includes 't' minutes that she spends in the coffee shop. Then, when she walks at a speed of 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same 't' minutes in the coffee shop.

So, the question is asking: If Aya walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, how many minutes will her walk take her, including the 't' minutes in the coffee shop?

Alright, let's break this down. It seems like a rate, time, distance problem. The formula I remember is:

Distance = Speed × Time

But in this case, the total time includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time. So, I think I can set up equations based on the two different speeds and the total time each takes.

First, let's convert all the times into the same units to make it easier. The problem gives times in hours and minutes, and the speed is in kilometers per hour. I think it would be better to convert everything into hours or everything into minutes. Let me decide: since the speed is in hours, maybe it's better to convert the 't' minutes into hours.

Wait, but the first scenario is 4 hours total, which includes 't' minutes in the coffee shop. So the walking time alone would be 4 hours minus t minutes. Similarly, the second scenario is 2 hours and 24 minutes total, which includes the same 't' minutes. So, the walking time there would be 2 hours and 24 minutes minus t minutes.

But to make this consistent, I should convert all time units to the same. Let's convert everything into hours. So, t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, for the first scenario:

Total time = 4 hours = walking time + coffee time
Walking time = 4 - (t/60) hours

But she walks 9 km at speed 's' km/h, so walking time is also equal to distance divided by speed, which is 9/s hours.

Therefore, equation one is:
9/s = 4 - (t/60)

Similarly, for the second scenario:

Total time = 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let's convert 24 minutes to hours: 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So total time is 2.4 hours.

Again, walking time is 2.4 - (t/60) hours.

But she walks 9 km at speed 's+2' km/h, so walking time is 9/(s+2) hours.

Equation two is:
9/(s+2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

So now, I have two equations:

1) 9/s = 4 - (t/60)
2) 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

I can solve these two equations to find 's' and 't'. Once I have those, I can calculate the total time when she walks at 's + 1/2' km/h.

Let me write the equations again for clarity.

Equation 1: 9/s = 4 - (t/60)
Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

Let me subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate 't'. Wait, actually, both equations have the same term (t/60). So, maybe I can rearrange each equation to express (t/60) and then set them equal.

From equation 1:
t/60 = 4 - (9/s)

From equation 2:
t/60 = 2.4 - (9/(s + 2))

Since both equal t/60, I can set them equal to each other:

4 - (9/s) = 2.4 - (9/(s + 2))

Now, I can solve for 's' by manipulating this equation.

Let me write it out:

4 - (9/s) = 2.4 - (9/(s + 2))

Let me subtract 2.4 from both sides:

4 - 2.4 - (9/s) + (9/(s + 2)) = 0

Calculate 4 - 2.4 = 1.6:

1.6 - (9/s) + (9/(s + 2)) = 0

Let me rearrange the terms:

1.6 = (9/s) - (9/(s + 2))

Factor out the 9:

1.6 = 9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)]

Compute the difference in the brackets:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] ) 
= 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So, substituting back:

1.6 = 9 * [2 / (s(s + 2))]

Simplify:

1.6 = (18) / [s(s + 2)]

Multiply both sides by s(s + 2):

1.6 * s(s + 2) = 18

Divide both sides by 1.6:

s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6

Calculate 18 / 1.6. Let me compute that.

1.6 goes into 18 how many times? 1.6 * 11 = 17.6, 1.6*11.25=18. So, 18 / 1.6 = 11.25.

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25

Expanding the left side:

s^2 + 2s = 11.25

Bring 11.25 to the left:

s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Now, we can solve this quadratic equation for 's'. Let's use the quadratic formula.

Quadratic in form: ax² + bx + c = 0
So, a = 1; b = 2; c = -11.25

Discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (2)^2 - 4 * 1 * (-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49

So sqrt(D) = 7

Thus, solutions:

s = [ -b ± sqrt(D) ] / (2a ) = [ -2 ± 7 ] / 2

So two possibilities:

1) s = ( -2 + 7 ) / 2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h

2) s = ( -2 -7 ) / 2 = (-9)/2 = -4.5 km/h

But speed can't be negative, so s = 2.5 km/h

So, s = 2.5 km/h

Now, let's find 't' using one of the earlier equations. Let's take equation 1:

t/60 = 4 - (9/s)

s is 2.5, so 9/s = 9/2.5.

Compute 9 ÷ 2.5:

2.5 * 3 = 7.5, so 9 ÷ 2.5 = 3.6

So, 9/s = 3.6 hours.

Thus, t/60 = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 hours.

Convert 0.4 hours to minutes: 0.4 * 60 = 24 minutes.

So, t = 24 minutes.

Wait, let me double-check that with equation 2:

t/60 = 2.4 - (9/(s + 2))

s + 2 = 2.5 + 2 = 4.5 km/h

9/(4.5) = 2 hours.

So, t/60 = 2.4 - 2 = 0.4 hours, which is 24 minutes
