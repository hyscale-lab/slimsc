Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start at the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. That makes sense because on an 8x8 grid, moving from one corner to the opposite requires 8 right moves and 8 up moves, totaling 16 steps.

The key part here is that the paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, changing direction exactly four times. So, let me try to visualize what that means. Each path is a sequence of moves, either right (R) or up (U). So, a path is a permutation of 8 R's and 8 U's. Normally, the total number of such paths is the combination of 16 moves taken 8 at a time, or C(16,8), which is 12870. But we're looking for a subset of these paths that change direction exactly four times.

Wait, what does it mean to change direction exactly four times? Each time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, for example, a path that starts with a bunch of R's followed by a bunch of U's would change direction once. Similarly, a path that alternates R and U every step would change direction 15 times, which is the maximum possible.

So, the problem is to count the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly four direction changes.

Let me think about how to model this. Each path is a sequence of R's and U's. A direction change occurs each time the move switches from R to U or U to R.

So, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs. A run is a consecutive sequence of the same move. For example, the sequence RRRUUURR has four runs: R, U, R. Wait, no, wait: RRR is one run, then UUU is another, then R is another, so three runs. So, number of direction changes is number of runs minus one. So, if a path has k runs, it has k-1 direction changes.

So, if we want exactly four direction changes, that means the path has five runs. Because 5 runs imply 4 direction changes.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of lattice paths with exactly five runs.

Now, the next question is: How to count such paths?

In the context of lattice paths, each run is a consecutive sequence of R's or U's. So, the path alternates between runs of R's and U's. Since we have five runs, the path can start with either R or U, and then alternate.

So, let's consider two cases: paths that start with R and those that start with U.

Case 1: The path starts with R.

In this case, the runs alternate between R and U. Since there are five runs, the sequence of runs will be R, U, R, U, R. So, three runs of R and two runs of U.

Wait, wait. Wait, starting with R and having five runs would mean odd number of runs. So, starting with R, the runs would be R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs.

Similarly, starting with U, the runs would be U, R, U, R, U. So, three U runs and two R runs.

So, in each case, the number of runs of R and U depends on which direction the path starts with.

So, for each case, we can model the problem as partitioning the total number of R's and U's (8 each) into the respective number of runs.

So, Case 1: Starting with R, three R runs and two U runs.

Each R run must have at least one R, and each U run must have at least one U.

Similarly, for Case 2: Starting with U, three U runs and two R runs.

Again, each run has at least one step.

So, the number of ways for each case can be calculated using stars and bars.

Wait, that's right. For Case 1: Starting with R
