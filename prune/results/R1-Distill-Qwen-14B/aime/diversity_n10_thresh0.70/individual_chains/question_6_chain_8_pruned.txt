Okay, so I need to figure out how many intersections there are between the graphs of y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.

First, let me understand what functions f and g are. They are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. So both are absolute value functions with some modifications. Maybe I should graph these functions first to get an idea.

Starting with f(x). The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtract 1/2, so |x| - 1/2. That would shift the graph down by 1/2. But since we take the absolute value again, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. So this will create a W shape, maybe? Let me think. When you have ||x| - a|, for some a, it's a V shape that's been shifted and then reflected. So for f(x):

- When |x| >= 1/2, |x| -1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| -1/2.
- When |x| < 1/2, |x| -1/2 is negative, so f(x) = -( |x| -1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.

So the graph of f(x) would have a V shape in the middle, reaching a maximum at x=0, f(0)=1/2, and then decreasing linearly on both sides until it reaches 0 at x=±1/2, then increasing again beyond that. So it's like a diamond shape with points at (0, 1/2) and (±1/2, 0).

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let me analyze that. Again, it's | |x| - 1/4 |.

- When |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| -1/4.
- When |x| < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|.

So the graph of g(x) has a maximum at x=0 with g(0)=1/4, then decreases until x=±1/4, where it's 0, then increases again beyond that.

Now, let's think about the composition of these functions in the given equations.

First, the function y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). Let me parse this.

It's 4 times g composed with f composed with sin(2πx). Let's break it down:

1. Start with sin(2πx). The sine function has a period of 1, since sin(2πx) has a period of 1 (since normally sin(2πx) has period 1). So this is a sine wave oscillating between -1 and 1, with period 1.

2. Apply f to this: f(sin(2πx)) = || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |. Since sin(2πx) ranges between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. So f(sin(2πx)) will take this and subtract 1/2, then take absolute value.

Wait, so f(sin(2πx)) can be written as | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |.

Let me think about the range of |sin(2πx)|. It's between 0 and 1. So | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 | will have the following behavior:

- When |sin(2πx)| >= 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. So that's a value between 0 and 1/2.
- When |sin(2πx)| < 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|. That ranges from 1/2 down to 0.

So the output of f(sin(2πx)) is between 0 and 1/2.

Then, this is fed into g. So g(f(sin(2πx))) = | |f(sin(2πx))| - 1/4 |. But since f gives a non-negative value, we can drop the absolute:

g(f(...)) = | f(...) - 1/4 |.

But wait, f(...) is between 0 and 1/2. So f(...) can be less than 1/4, between 1/4 and 1/2, or equal to 1/4.

So let me see:

- When f(...) >= 1/4, g(f(...)) = f(...) - 1/4. So this is between 0 and 1/4.
- When f(...) < 1/4, g(f(...)) = 1/4 - f(...). So this is between 0 and 1/4 as well.

So overall, g(f(...)) ranges between 0 and 1/4.

Then, multiplied by 4, y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))) will have a range of 0 to 1.

So y ranges between 0 and 1, because 4*(1/4) =1.

Similarly, x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))).

Same idea, let's see:

Start with cos(3πy). The cosine function typically ranges between -1 and 1, but since we'll take absolute value first in f, let's see.

Again, the function is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))).

So steps:

1. cos(3πy): since y is a variable here, the period of cos(3πy) is 2/(3π) in terms of y, but since we're dealing with it as a function of y, the period is 2/3 in y, oscillating between -1 and 1.

2. Then f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|.

Same as
