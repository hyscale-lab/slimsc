Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It says:

Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, circumradius 13, and inradius 6. Find AB · AC.

Hmm, I need to find the product of the lengths of sides AB and AC. Let me try to visualize the triangle first. So, there's triangle ABC with its circumcenter O and incenter I. IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, which is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius is 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle.

I remember that the circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle by the formula:

R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ)

where a, b, c are the sides and Δ is the area. The inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter s by:

r = Δ/s

So, given R = 13 and r = 6, maybe I can find some relations between the sides.

But wait, there's also this condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. IA is the segment from the inradius to vertex A, and OI is the segment from the circumradius to the inradius. So, IA ⊥ OI.

I need to recall if there's a known formula or theorem that relates these two radii and this perpendicularity condition.

I think in triangle geometry, there are relations involving the distances between the incenter and circumcenter. The formula for the distance between O and I is:

OI^2 = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Yes, that's a standard formula. So, OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr.

Given R = 13 and r = 6, let me compute OI.

OI^2 = 13^2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13.

So, OI = sqrt(13).

Okay, now I know OI is sqrt(13). Also, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IOA, IA is perpendicular to OI, making this a right triangle with right angle at A? Wait, no. IA is perpendicular to OI, so the triangle formed is triangle IOA with right angle at I
