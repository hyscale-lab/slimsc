Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first, and on each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 make it so that Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this. It seems like a combinatorial game theory problem, probably involving determining winning and losing positions. A losing position is one where no matter what move you make, you leave the opponent in a winning position. Conversely, a winning position is one where you can make a move that forces the opponent into a losing position.

So, let's model this. Let's define the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). The losing positions are the ones where the current player cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.

The base case is when n=0, which isn't a playable position because there are no tokens left, but the previous player took the last token, so n=0 is a losing position for the player about to move. Wait, actually, n=0 is a terminal state, so maybe I should think differently. Let me clarify:

- If a player faces n=0 tokens, they can't make a move, so the previous player has already won. So, positions with n=0 are losing for the current player.

Wait, no. If the current player is at n=0, they can't make a move, so they lose. That makes sense. So, n=0 is a losing position.

Now, for n=1: The current player can take 1 token, leaving 0 for the opponent, who then loses. So n=1 is a winning position.

Similarly, n=2: take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, which is a winning position for them. Wait, but does that mean n=2 is a losing position for the current player? Because whatever they do, they leave the opponent in a winning position. Let me see.

Wait, no. Let me be more precise. The key is to determine for each n whether it's a winning or losing position.

Let me start building a table for small n and see the pattern.

n | Result (W/L)
0 | L (current player can't move
