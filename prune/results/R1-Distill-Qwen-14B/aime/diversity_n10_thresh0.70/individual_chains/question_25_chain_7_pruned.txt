Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember something about using inclusion-exclusion principles for these kinds of problems, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

First, the problem states there are 900 residents. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which I guess is a given for everyone. So that's like a universal set. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 respectively.

Wait, so each resident owns at least the candy hearts. That means the total number of owners for the other items might be more than the given numbers because some people might own more than one. Hmm, no, wait, the given numbers are the counts of people who own each of those items. So, 195 people own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. But some people might own more than one of these, right?

The problem also gives some additional information: 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We're asked to find how many own all four—wait, all four? Oh, because the candy hearts are universal, so if someone owns all three other items plus the candy hearts, that's four things. So, we're looking for the number of residents who own all four.

Let me try to structure this. I think using the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets might be helpful, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, because the candy hearts are universal, they're present in everyone. So, maybe I can model this as three sets: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), and garden spades (S), and the universal set U for candy hearts.

But since every resident is in U, the problem reduces to finding the intersection of D, G, and S. Because if someone is in all three D, G, S, and U, that's all four. But since U is everyone, the four-way intersection is just the three-way intersection of D, G, and S. So, maybe the problem is just asking for |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem says "own all four of these things," which are diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Since everyone owns candy hearts, the four-way intersection is the same as the three-way intersection of D, G, and S. So, the number we're looking for is |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Now, how do I find that? I remember that the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets says:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|

But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Also
