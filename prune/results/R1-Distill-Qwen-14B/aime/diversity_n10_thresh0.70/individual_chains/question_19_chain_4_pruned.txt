Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again: Triangle ABC has circumcenter O and incenter I. It says that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay.

First, let me recall some basic definitions. The circumradius (R) is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides, and the incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet.

The problem gives me R = 13 and r = 6. Also, IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems like a key piece of information. I need to figure out what that implies about the triangle.

Let me try to visualize the triangle. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe there's a right triangle involved here. I know that O is the circumcenter and I is the incenter. In some cases, these points can coincide, but in general, they're different. For example, in an equilateral triangle, O and I are the same point, but here, since IA is perpendicular to OI, they must be distinct.

I remember that in some triangles, like isosceles triangles, the incenter and circumcenter lie along the same line, which is the altitude. But in this case, IA is perpendicular to OI, so that might not be the case. Hmm.

Let me think about the positions of O and I. O is the circumcenter, so it's equidistant from all three vertices. I is the incenter, so it's equidistant from all three sides. The line OI connects these two centers. IA is the segment from the incenter I to vertex A, and it's perpendicular to OI.

So, in triangle AIO, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, triangle AIO is a right-angled triangle at I. So, AI is perpendicular to OI.

I can try to express the lengths of AI and OI in terms of other triangle properties.

I know several formulas related to the inradius and circumradius. For example, the area of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius and the semiperimeter: Area = r * s, where s is the semiperimeter.

Also, the area can be expressed using the circumradius as (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.

Wait, but I need AB * AC. Let me denote AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a. So, sides opposite angles A, B, C are a, b, c, respectively.

I need to find b * c. Hmm.

I also know that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.

Yes, there's a formula: OI² = R(R - 2r). So, OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)). Plugging in the values, R = 13, r = 6, so OI² = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13). Okay.

So, OI = sqrt(13). Now, in triangle AIO, which is right-angled at I, the sides are AI, IO, and AO. Since AO is the circumradius, which is 13. So, AO = 13.

In a right-angled triangle, by Pythagoras: AI² + IO² = AO².

So, AI² + (sqrt(13))² = 13².

That simplifies to AI² + 13 = 169.

So, AI² = 169 - 13 = 156. Therefore, AI = sqrt(156). Simplify that: sqrt(4*39)
