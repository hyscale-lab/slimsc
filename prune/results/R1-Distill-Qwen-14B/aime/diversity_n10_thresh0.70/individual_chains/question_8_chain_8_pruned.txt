Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It tells me that the sum of the three variables is 300. Since they are nonnegative integers, each of a, b, c can range from 0 up to 300, as long as their sum is exactly 300.

The second equation looks more complicated: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Let me see if I can factor this or find a way to simplify it.

Looking at the terms, I notice that each term is a product of two variables squared and the third. For example, a²b and a²c both have a² multiplied by b and c respectively. Similarly, the other terms are structured the same way with b² and c². Maybe I can factor this expression somehow.

Let me try factoring:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, the entire expression becomes:
a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit cleaner. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let me substitute that into the equation.

Substituting, we get:
a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

So, that simplifies the equation further:
300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Let me rewrite that:
300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. Now, maybe I can relate this to known identities or find a way to express a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of a + b + c and other symmetric sums.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c is 300, then 300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc.

Also, I recall that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed as (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So, a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3S Q + 3P.

Let me plug that into our earlier equation. The equation was:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

First, let's express a² + b² + c² in terms of S and Q. From the identity above, a² + b² + c² = S² - 2Q. So, 300*(S² - 2Q) - (S³ - 3S Q + 3P) = 6,000,000.

Substituting S = 300:

300*(300² - 2Q) - (300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 300² is 90,000. So, 300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 300*90,000 - 300*2Q = 27,000,000 - 600Q.

Now, let's compute the second part: 300³ is 27,000,000. So, 300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P = 27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3P.

Putting it all together:

27,000,000 - 600Q - (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P) = 6,000,000.

Let me distribute the negative sign:

27,000,000 - 600Q -27,000,000 + 900Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

Simplify the terms:

(27,000,000 -27,000,000) + (-600Q +900Q) -3P = 6,000,000.

So, 0 + 300Q -3P = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100 Q - P = 2,000,000.

So, now we have an equation: 100 Q - P = 2,000,000.

Where Q = ab + bc + ca and P = abc.

So, 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me write this as:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.

Hmm, but how does this help? Maybe I can factor this or find some substitution.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe I can set variables x, y, z to represent a, b, c, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of symmetric polynomials.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that given a + b + c = 300, and ab + bc + ca = Q, and abc = P, and the relation 100 Q - P = 2,000,000, so P = 100 Q - 2,000,000.

So, P is 100Q - 2,000,000.

So, the idea is, for the variables a, b, c, they must satisfy:

a + b + c = 300,

ab + bc + ca = Q,

abc = 100 Q - 2,000,000.

So, these are symmetric equations. Maybe I can express this as a cubic equation whose roots are a, b, c.

The monic cubic polynomial with roots a, b, c is:

x³ - S x² + Q x - P = 0,

which becomes:

x³ - 300 x² + Q x - (100 Q - 2,000,000) = 0.

Simplify this:

x³ - 300 x² + Q x - 100 Q + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, that's:

x³ - 300 x² + Q (x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can think of Q as a variable and see if I can find possible integer solutions.

Alternatively,
