Okay, so I've got this math problem here about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, going from the lower left corner to the upper right corner. And the catch is, they have to change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I know that in a grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right typically means moving only right and up. Since it's an 8x8 grid, you have to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So, the total number of paths without any restrictions is the number of ways to arrange 8 rights and 8 ups, which is the combination C(16,8). But this problem is more specific because it's talking about changing direction exactly four times.

Wait, what does changing direction mean? Each time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, for example, if you start by moving right, then up, then right again, that's two direction changes. But in this problem, we need paths that change direction exactly four times.

Let me think about how the number of direction changes relates to the number of segments in the path. Each direction change splits the path into a new segment. So, if you change direction four times, you'll have five segments. Because the first segment is just the initial direction, then each change adds a new segment.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the number of direction changes is one less than the number of segments. So, if you have four direction changes, that's five segments, each consisting of a run of right or up moves. Now, each of these segments has to be at least one step long, right? You can't have a segment of zero length because that would mean not moving, which doesn't make sense in this context.

So, since we're dealing with an 8x8 grid, the total right steps are 8, and the total up steps are 8. These steps are divided into segments. Each time we change direction, we switch between right and up. So, the number of right segments and up segments depends on whether the first move is right or up.

Wait, okay, so let's consider two cases: paths that start with a right move and paths that start with an up move. Because the grid is symmetric, maybe the number of paths in each case is the same, so I
