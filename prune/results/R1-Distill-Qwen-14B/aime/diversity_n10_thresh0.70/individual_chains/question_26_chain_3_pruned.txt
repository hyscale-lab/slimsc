Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. I need to find the length of AP, given that AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me start by drawing a rough sketch in my mind. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, the sides are all different, making it a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. Point D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C. Then, line AD intersects ω again at P. We need to find AP.

I remember that the point where two tangents intersect is called the exsymmedian point or something related. But I'm not too sure. Maybe I should recall some properties about tangents and power of a point.

Power of a point D with respect to ω: since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, the power of D is equal to DB² = DC² because both are tangents from D to ω. So, DB = DC. That might be useful.

Another thing I know is that in such configurations, the point P is the midpoint of the arc AC that doesn't contain B, but wait, no, that's when dealing with symmedians. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, I can think about using harmonic division or projective geometry concepts, but maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, coordinate geometry? But that might get messy with the given side lengths.

Alternatively, maybe I can use inversion, but I'm not too confident about that approach right now.

Wait, I think using power of a point might be the way to go here. Let me recall that the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC² = DA * DP. Because AD is a secant intersecting ω at A and P, so DA * DP = DB².
