Okay, so I have this problem here with points O, A, and B given. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). There's a family F of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. I need to find a point C on AB, not equal to A or B, that only lies on AB and no other segment from F. Then find OC squared, which is given as p/q, and find p + q.

Hmm, first, let me visualize this. Points O, A, and B form a triangle. Let me plot them mentally: O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis towards (1,0), and B is a point on the y-axis just a bit above (0,1) since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. So AB is a line segment connecting (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2).

The family F consists of all segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1. So each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) with sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. Also, since they're in the first quadrant, p and q are positive.

So each PQ is a line from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p² + q² = 1.

Wait, but PQ is in the first quadrant and has length 1, so p and q are positive and satisfy p² + q² = 1.

So for each such segment, the equation of the line PQ can be found.

Now, the problem says that AB is one such segment from F, because the distance from A to B is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So AB is indeed a segment in F.

So, the family F includes AB and other segments similar to it but with different p and q, but all of length 1.

Now, the point C is on AB, but it's not A or B, and it's unique in that it's only on AB and no other segment from F. So, for all other segments PQ in F, C is not on them. So, C is the only point on AB that's not on any other PQ.

I need to find OC squared. So, let me think about how to find such a point C.

First, parametrize AB. Let me find the equation of AB.

Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2).

The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)*(0) + intercept. Wait, when x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2, so the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Wait, no. Wait, slope is -sqrt(3), and when x=1/2, y=0.

So using point-slope form: y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So any point C on AB can be written as (t, -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2), where t ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Wait, but t is the x-coordinate. So when t=1/2, y=0, which is point A, and when t=0, y=sqrt(3)/2, which is point B.

So, C is somewhere on AB, so its coordinates are (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2). And we need to find t such that C is not on any other segment PQ in F except AB.

So, for other segments PQ in F, C should not lie on them.

So, suppose there's another PQ with P(p,0) and Q(0,q), where p² + q² = 1, p ≠ 1/2 and q ≠ sqrt(3)/2.

We need that the line PQ doesn't pass through C except when PQ is AB.

So, the condition is that for all other PQ in F, the line PQ does not pass through C.

Alternatively, C is the only point on AB that is intersected by AB and no other PQ in F.

So, to find such a point C, perhaps it's the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of all such lines PQ.

Wait, the envelope of the family F of lines PQ would form a curve, and if AB is one of those lines, then the point where AB is tangent to the envelope would be the point C that's only on AB and no other PQ.

Hmm, that might be the case.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of all the lines PQ as a family and find where AB is tangent to their envelope.

So, first, let's find the equation of the envelope of the family F.

Each line PQ can be written as x/p + y/q = 1, since it's a line from (p,0) to (0,q).

But since p² + q² = 1, the constraint is on p and q.

So, the family is x/p + y/q = 1, with p² + q² = 1.

To find the envelope, we can use the method where we take F(x,y,p,q) = x/p + y/q - 1 = 0, and the constraint G(p,q) = p² + q² -1 = 0.

Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, or using the condition for the envelope: for each p and q, the envelope satisfies F = 0 and dF/dp = 0 and dF/dq = 0.

Wait, but actually, the envelope is found by solving F(x,y,p,q) = 0 and dF/dλ = 0 where λ is a parameter. Hmm, maybe I should use the standard method.

Wait, the envelope of a family of curves F(x,y,p) = 0 is found by solving F(x,y,p) = 0 and dF/dp = 0.

In this case, let's treat p as the parameter. So, for each p, the line is x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = 1, since q = sqrt(1 - p²). Wait, because p² + q² =1, so q = sqrt(1 - p²), and since q is positive in the first quadrant.

So, we can write the line as x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = 1.

So, F(x,y,p) = x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) - 1 = 0.

Now, to find the envelope, we take dF/dp = 0.

Compute dF/dp:

dF/dp = (-x)/p² + (y * ( (1/2)(1 - p²)^(-1/2) * (2p) )) / ( (sqrt(1 - p²))^2 ) )

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

F(x,y,p) = x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p²) - 1.

So, dF/dp = derivative of x/p is -x/p².

Derivative of y / sqrt(1 - p²) is y * (1/2)(1 - p²)^(-3/2) * (2p) ) = y * p / (1 - p²)^(3/2).

So, dF/dp = -x/p² + (y p) / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = 0.

So, the envelope satisfies both F(x,y,p)=0 and dF/dp=0.

So, now, two equations:

1) x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p²) = 1.

2) -x/p² + (y p) / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = 0.

We can try to solve for x and y in terms of p.

From equation 2:

-x/p² + (y p) / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = 0.

Let me write equation 2 as:

(y p) / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = x / p².

So x = (y p^3 ) / (1 - p²)^(3/2).

Now, substitute x into equation 1.

x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p²) = 1.

x/p = y p^2 / (1 - p²)^(3/2).

So, equation 1 becomes:

y p^2 / (1 - p²)^(3/2) + y / sqrt(1 - p²) = 1.

Factor out y:

y [ p^2 / (1 - p²)^(3/2) + 1 / sqrt(1 - p²) ] = 1.

Let me combine the terms inside the brackets:

= [ p^2 + (1 - p²) ] / (1 - p²)^(3/2 )

= [ p^2 + 1 - p² ] / (1 - p²)^(3/2 )

= 1 / (1 - p²)^(3/2 )

So, equation becomes:

y * [1 / (1 - p²)^(3/2 ) ] = 1.

Thus,

y = (1 - p²)^(3/2 )

Then, from equation 2, x = (y p^3 ) / (1 - p²)^(3/2 )

Substituting y:

x = [ (1 - p²)^(3/2 ) * p^3 ] / (1 - p²)^(3/2 ) ) = p^3.

So, x = p^3 and y = (1 - p²)^(3/2 ).

So, the envelope is parametrized by p as (p^3, (1 - p²)^(3/2 )).

Wait, that's interesting. So, the envelope is a parametric curve given by x = p^3, y = (1
