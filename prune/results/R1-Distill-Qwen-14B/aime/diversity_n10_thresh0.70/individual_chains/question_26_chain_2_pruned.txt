Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

Hmm, first, let me recall some geometry concepts. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the ex-pole of BC with respect to the circle ω. Also, in such cases, D is the exsimilicenter or the external homothety center of the circle with respect to BC.

Wait, another thought: the point where two tangents meet is called the external homothety center. So, BD and CD are tangents from D to ω, meaning BD = CD. So triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Also, since AD intersects ω at P, then AP is a secant of the circle. Maybe we can use some power of a point theorem here.

Power of a point D with respect to ω: the power of D is equal to DB², since DB is the tangent from D to ω. Similarly, DC² is also equal to the power of D. So, DB² = DC² = power of D.

Now, since AD passes through ω at A and P, the power of D with respect to ω should also be equal to DA * DP. So, we have DB² = DA * DP.

So, if I let DA = x, then DP = x + AP, but wait, actually, in power of a point, it's DA * DP. Wait, no: if P is the second intersection point, then DP = PA + AP? Wait, let me think.

Actually, the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DA * DP, where DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P.

Wait, no: the power of D is equal to DB² = DA * DP. But when you have a point outside the circle, and a secant that goes through the circle, the power is equal to the product of the lengths from the point to the two intersection points. So, yes, DB² = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DA, then I can find DP, and since AP = DP - DA, perhaps? Wait, no. Wait, AP is the distance from A to P along the secant. So, DA is from D to A, and DP is from D to P.

If A is between D and P, then DP = DA + AP. So, AP = DP - DA.

But I need AP, which is the segment inside the circle. So, perhaps we can express AP in terms of DA and DP.

But how? Let me write the equations:

DB² =
