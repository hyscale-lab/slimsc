Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

So, Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. The question is about the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention that this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime positive integers, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm. So, it's a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is about the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B), but in this case, if A is a subset of B, then P(A and B) is just P(A). So, in this case, winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize because if she wins the grand prize, she definitely wins a prize. So, the probability we're looking for is P(grand prize) / P(prize).

So, let me denote:

- A: the event that Jen wins a prize (at least two numbers match).
- B: the event that Jen wins the grand prize (all four numbers match).

We need to find P(B|A) = P(B) / P(A).

So, first, I need to calculate P(B) and P(A).

Let me figure out how many ways there are for each of these events.

The total number of possible lottery outcomes is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is C(10,4). C(n,k) is the combination formula, n! / (k!(n - k)!).

So, total possible outcomes: C(10,4) = 210.

Now, the number of ways Jen can win the grand prize is the number of ways her 4 numbers are exactly the chosen ones. Since she has picked 4 specific numbers, there's only 1 way this can happen. So, number of favorable outcomes for B is 1. Therefore, P(B) = 1 / 210.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the total possible lottery outcomes are C(10,4), and the number of favorable for B is C(4,4) = 1, so yes, P(B) = 1 / 210.

Next, I need to find P(A), the probability that Jen wins a prize, which is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. Hmm, so this can happen in several ways: exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 numbers match. So, the total number of favorable outcomes for A is the sum of the number of ways to choose exactly 2, exactly 3, and exactly 4 of her numbers.

Alternatively, since calculating the probability of at least two can sometimes be easier by subtracting the probability of fewer than two (i.e., zero or one matches) from 1. So, perhaps it's easier to compute 1 - P(zero matches) - P(exactly one match).

Let me try that approach.

So, P(A) = 1 - P(zero matches) - P(exactly one match).

So, first, let me compute P(zero matches). That is, none of Jen's numbers are chosen. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 10, none of which are in Jen's 4 numbers. So, the remaining numbers are 10 - 4 = 6. So, the number of ways is C(6,4).

C(6,4) is 15. So, number of ways for zero matches is 15, so P(zero matches) = 15 / 210 = 1/14.

Next, P(exactly one match). That's the number of ways to choose exactly one of Jen's 4 numbers and three from the remaining 6. So, the number of ways is C(4,1) * C(6,3).

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80. So, the number of ways for exactly one match is 80, so P(exactly one match) = 80 / 210.

Simplify that: 80 / 210 = 8/21.

So, putting it together, P(A) = 1 - (1/14) - (8/21).

Let me compute that.

First, find a common denominator for 14 and 21, which is 42.

1 = 42/42.

1/14 = 3/42.

8/21 = 16/42.

So, P(A) = 42/42 - 3/42 - 16/42 = (42 - 3 - 16)/42 = (23)/42.

Wait, 42 - 3 is 39, then 39 -16 is 23. So, 23/42.

So, P(A) is 23/42.

Wait, let me double-check that. Alternatively, calculating the number of favorable outcomes for A:

Number of ways to choose 2,3, or 4 numbers matching.

So, exactly 2: C(4,2)*C(6,2).

Exactly 3: C(4,3)*C(6,1).

Exactly 4: C(4,4)*C(6,0).

So, let's compute these.

Exactly 2: C(4,2) is 6, C(6,2) is 15, so 6 *15=90.

Exactly 3: C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6, so 4*6=24.

Exactly 4: C(4,4)=1, C(6,0)=1, so 1*1=1.

Total favorable for A: 90 + 24 + 1 = 1
