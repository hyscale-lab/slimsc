Okay, so we've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Hmm, okay, so that means A, D, H, G form a cyclic quadrilateral. Interesting.

Given lengths: BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. We need to find the length of CE.

Let me sketch this out mentally. Rectangle ABCD has AB=107 and BC=16, so it's a pretty long rectangle. Rectangle EFGH has FG=17 and EF=184, so it's also a long rectangle but not as long as ABCD.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, they lie on a straight line. So, the order of the points on this line must be such that D is connected to E, which is connected to C, which is connected to F. So, the line is D-E-C-F.

Now, rectangles ABCD and EFGH. So, in rectangle ABCD, AB is the length, BC is the width. So, if AB=107, BC=16, then the rectangle has sides 107 and 16. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has FG=17 and EF=184, so its sides are 17 and 184.

Wait, but the sides of a rectangle are opposite and equal, so in EFGH, EF and GH are 184, and FG and EH are 17. So, EF is the length, FG is the width.

Now, since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, that's a cyclic quadrilateral. I remember that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is 180 degrees. But I'm not sure how that helps yet.

Let me try to assign coordinates to these points to make it more concrete. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and D is at (0,0), then C would be at (BC, 0)? Wait, no, because in rectangle ABCD, BC is one side. Wait, ABCD is a rectangle, so the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA.

Wait, actually, if D is at (0,0), then since ABCD is a rectangle, if AB is 107 and BC is 16, then the coordinates would be as follows:

Point D: (0,0)
Point C: (0, BC) but wait, BC is a vertical side, right? Wait, maybe I should think of ABCD as having AB as the base. Let me try to clarify the rectangle's orientation.

Wait, no, in rectangle ABCD, the points are in order A-B-C-D-A. So, AB is a horizontal side, BC is vertical, CD is horizontal, DA is vertical. So, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (something, 0), but that would make BC vertical. Wait, maybe I should assign coordinates differently.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to place point D at (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point C would be at (x, 0), point B at (x, y), and point A at (0, y). Wait, no, because ABCD is a rectangle, so sides AB and CD are equal and parallel, and sides BC and AD are equal and parallel.

Wait, maybe I should assign coordinates more carefully.

Let me consider rectangle ABCD with AB=107, BC=16. Let me position it such that D is at (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point C is at (107, 0), point B is at (107,16), and point A is at (0,16). Wait, no, because AB is 107, so from A to B is 107 units. Hmm, perhaps I should adjust.

Wait, in rectangle ABCD, AB is the length from A to B, BC is from B to C, CD is from C to D, and DA is from D to A.

So, if I place point A at (0,0), then point B would be at (AB, 0) = (107, 0). Then, point C would be at (107, BC), which is (107,16), and point D would be at (0,16). That makes sense.

So, A(0,0), B(107,0), C(107,16), D(0,16). Okay.

Now, rectangle EFGH. Let's see. Points E, F, G, H. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, and the line passes through D, E, C, F. So, in our coordinate system, D is at (0,16), C is at (107,16), so the line D-E-C-F must be horizontal? Because D and C are both at y=16. So, the line is y=16.

So, points D(0,16), E somewhere on this line, then C(107,16), then F further along. So, E is between D and C? Or could it be outside? Hmm, but since E is part of rectangle EFGH, and F is next after C, perhaps E is to the left of D and F is to the right of C? Or maybe E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.

Wait, the way it's written is D, E, C, F are collinear in that order. So, the line goes D-E-C-F. So, in order, starting at D, then E, then C, then F. So, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.

Wait, but in our coordinate system, D is at (0,16), C is at (107,16). So, E must be between D and C. So, E is at some point (x,16), where x is between 0 and 107. Then, F is beyond C, at (107 + something,16).

Wait, but then rectangle EFGH. Let's think about the rectangle. Since EFGH is a rectangle, and F and E are on the line y=16, but H and G are other points. Wait, but points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, points A(0,0), D(0,16), H, G are on a circle.

Hmm, maybe we can find where H and G are.

Let me try to figure out the coordinates of E, F, G, H.

Since EFGH is a rectangle, and E, F, G, H are the vertices. Let's assume E is at (e,16), F is at (f,16), since they are on the line y=16. Then, since EFGH is a rectangle, the sides EF and FG are perpendicular. So, from E to F is along the x-axis (since they're on y=16), so the next side FG should be vertical. But wait, FG is given as 17 units. So, from F, moving up or down 17 units to get to G.

Wait, let me think again. Since EFGH is a rectangle, the sides EF and FG are adjacent sides. So, from E to F is a horizontal line, as they're on y=16. Then, from F to G would be vertical, either up or down. Since FG is of length 17, and rectangle sides are perpendicular.

Similarly, from G to H would be horizontal opposite to EF, and H to E would be vertical opposite to FG.

Wait, but EF is given as 184. So, the length from E to F is 184 units. But wait, in our coordinate system, E is at (e,16), F is at (f,16), so the distance EF is |f - e| = 184. But in our earlier setup, E is between D(0,16) and C(107,16). So, E is at (e,16), where e is between 0 and 107, and F is at (f,16), but then |f - e| = 184. But since E is between D and C, which are at 0 and 107, and F is beyond C. So, E is at, say, (e,16), then F is at (e + 184,16). But since e is between 0 and 107, e + 184 would be between 184 and 291, which is way beyond C(107,16). Hmm, that seems possible.

But wait, this would mean that F is very far to the right of C. But then, the rectangle EFGH would be a very long rectangle.

Wait, but wait, the problem says FG=17. So, from F to G, we move up (or down) 17 units. So, if F is at (f,16), then G is at (f,16+17) or (f,16-17). Since we're dealing with a rectangle, let's assume it's upwards, so G is at (f, 33). Then, from G, moving left 184 units (since EF is 184), we reach H at (f - 184, 33). Then, from H, moving down 17 units to reach E at (f - 184, 16). Wait, but E is already at (e,16), so e = f - 184. But earlier, we have that EF = 184, which is f - e = 184. So, substituting e = f - 184, we get f - (f - 184) = 184, which holds. So, that's consistent.

So, putting it all together, E is at (e,16) = (f - 184, 16), F is at (f,16), G is at (f,33), H is at (f - 184,33).

Now, the rectangle EFGH has sides EF=184, FG=17.

Now, points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(f - 184, 33), G(f,33) lie on a circle.

So, four points: A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x,33), G(y,33). These four points are concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circle.

We can use the condition for concyclic points. One way to find if four points lie on a circle is to use the cyclic quadrilateral condition, which involves the slopes of the lines and the perpendicular bisectors, but that might get complicated.

Alternatively, we can use the fact that four points lie on a circle if the determinant of the following matrix is zero:

|x y x² + y² 1|
|0 0 0        1|
|0 16 0² +16² 1|
|x_H y_H x_H² + y_H² 1|
|x_G y_G x_G² + y_G² 1|

Wait, but that's a 5x5 determinant, which is a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe using the power of a point or something else.

Wait, another approach: since points A, D, H, G are concyclic, the power of point A with respect to the circle should satisfy certain conditions. Alternatively, we can write the equation of the circle passing through A, D, and H, and check if G also lies on it.

So, let's find the equation of the circle passing through A(0,0), D(0,16), and H(f - 184,33). Then, we can check if G(f,33) also lies on it.

The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0. Since it passes through A(0,0):

0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 => c = 0.

So, the equation simplifies to x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy = 0.

Now, it passes through D(0,16):

0 + (16)^2 + 0 + 2f*(16) = 0
256 + 32f = 0
32f = -256
f = -8.

So, now the equation becomes x² + y² + 2gx - 16y = 0.

Now, it passes through H(f - 184,33). Let me denote f as F for clarity, but wait, in our variables earlier, F is a coordinate, which might conflict with f in the circle equation. Hmm, maybe I should use a different notation for the circle's equation. Let's say x² + y² + 2Gx + 2Fy + C = 0. But since A(0,0) is on it, C=0. So, equation is x² + y² + 2Gx + 2Fy = 0.

Now, plug in D(0,16):

0 + 256 + 0 + 32F = 0
256 + 32F = 0
32F = -256
F = -8.

So, equation becomes x² + y² + 2Gx -16y = 0.

Now, plug in H(f - 184,33):

(f - 184)^2 + (33)^2 + 2G*(f - 184) -16*33 = 0.

Let me compute each term:

(f - 184)^2 = f² - 368f + (184)^2.

33² = 1089.

2G*(f - 184) = 2Gf - 368G.

-16*33 = -528.

So, putting it all together:

f² - 368f + 184² + 1089 + 2Gf - 368G -528 = 0.

Simplify:

f² - 368f + (184²) + 1089 -528 + 2Gf - 368G = 0.

Compute 184²: 184*184. Let me compute that. 180² is 32400, 4² is 16, and 2*180*4=1440. So, (180+4)^2=180² + 2*180*4 +4²=32400 + 1440 +16=33856.

So, 33856 + 1089 = 34945; 34945 -528 = 34417.

So, equation is:

f² - 368f + 34417 + 2Gf - 368G = 0.

Let's collect like terms:

f² + (-368 + 2G)f + (34417 - 368G) = 0.

Now, also, the circle passes through G(f,33). Let's plug G(f,33) into the circle equation:

f² + (33)^2 + 2G*f - 16*33 = 0.

Compute:

f² + 1089 + 2Gf - 528 = 0.

Simplify:

f² + 2Gf + (1089 -528) = 0
f² + 2Gf + 561 = 0.

Now, we have two equations:

1) f² + (-368 + 2G)f + (34417 - 368G) = 0.

2) f² + 2Gf + 561 = 0.

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

[ f² + (-368 + 2G)f + (34417 - 368G) ] - [ f² + 2Gf + 561 ] = 0.

Simplify:

f² - f² + (-368 + 2G - 2G)f + (34417 -368G -561) = 0.

This reduces to:

-368f + (34417 - 561 -368G) = 0.

Compute 34417 -561: 34417 - 500 =33917, 33917 -61=33856.

So:

-368f + (33856 -368G) = 0.

Factor out 368:

-368(f + G) +33856 =0.

Wait, no, let me see:

-368f +33856 -368G =0.

Factor out -368:

-368(f + G) +33856 =0.

But let me rearrange:

-368(f + G) = -33856.

Divide both sides by -368:

f + G = (-33856)/(-368) = 33856 / 368.

Compute 33856 ÷ 368.

Let me see: 368 * 90 = 33120. 33856 - 33120 = 736.

368 * 2 = 736. So, 90 +2=92.

So, f + G = 92.

So, we have f + G =92. Equation (3).

Now, from equation 2: f² + 2Gf +561=0.

Let me write equation 2 as:

f² + 2Gf = -561.

But from equation 3: G =92 -f.

Substitute G into equation 2:

f² + 2*(92 -f)*f = -561.

Compute:

f² + 2*(92f -f²) = -561

f² + 184f -2f² = -561

Combine like terms:

-f² +184f +561=0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

f² -184f -561=0.

Now, solve for f using quadratic formula.

f = [184 ± sqrt(184² +4*561) ] / 2.

Compute discriminant:

184² is 33856, 4*561=2244.

So, sqrt(33856 +2244)=sqrt(36100)=190.

So, f = [184 ±190]/2.

So, two possible solutions:

1) f=(184+190)/2=(374)/2=187.

2) f=(184-190)/2=(-6)/2=-3.

So, f=187 or f=-3.

Since in our coordinate system, F is at (f,16). But earlier, we had E at (e,16)=(f -184,16). So, if f=187, then e=187-184=3. So, E is at (3,16), which is between D(0,16) and C(107,16). That makes sense.

If f=-3, then e= -3 -184= -187. So, E would be at (-187,16), which is way to the left of D(0,16). Then, F would be at (-3,16). But then, in that case, the rectangle EFGH would have points E(-187,16), F(-3,16), G(-3,33), H(-187,33). But then, points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(-187,33), G(-3,33) lie on a circle. Hmm, that's possible, but let's see if it makes sense with the given problem.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's given that D, E, C, F are collinear. Let me check if E is between D and C for both cases.

Case 1: f=187, e=3. So, E is at (3,16), which is between D(0,16) and C(107,16). So, D-E-C-F, with F at (187,16). So, that seems correct.

Case 2: f=-3, e=-187. So, E is at (-187,16), which is to the left of D(0,16). Then, F is at (-3,16). So, the line would be D-E-C-F, but E is way to the left of D, which might not fit the order D-E-C-F. Hmm, because in this case, the order would be E-D-C-F, not D-E-C-F. So, probably f=187 is the correct solution.

So, f=187, G=92 -f=92 -187= -95.

So, G=-95.

So, points:

E is at (3,16),

F is at (187,16),

G is at (187,33),

H is at (3,33).

Wait, no: Wait, earlier, we had H at (f -184,33). Since f=187, H is at 187 -184=3, so H(3,33). Similarly, G is at (f,33)= (187,33).

So, rectangle EFGH has points:

E(3,16), F(187,16), G(187,33), H(3,33).

Wait, that's a rectangle with length EF=184, as 187-3=184, and height FG=17, as 33-16=17. That checks out.

So, now, we have all the points.

Now, the question is to find the length of CE.

Point C is at (107,16), and point E is at (3,16). So, the distance between C and E is |107 -3|=104.

Wait, that's straightforward. So, CE=104.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes.

Wait, let me recap:

1. Assigned coordinates to ABCD with A(0,0), B(107,0), C(107,16), D(0,16).

2. Points D(0,16), E, C(107,16), F are collinear on y=16.

3. Rectangle EFGH: E(e,16), F(f,16), G(f,33), H(e,33). With EF=184, so f - e=184. FG=17, so vertical side.

4. Points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(e,33), G(f,33) lie on a circle.

5. Using the circle equation, found that f=187, e=3, so E is at (3,16).

6. Therefore, CE is the distance from (107,16) to (3,16), which is 104.

That seems correct.

I think that's the answer.


The problem involves two rectangles, $ABCD$ and $EFGH$, with points $D, E, C, F$ collinear on the line $y=16$. Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ have dimensions $AB=107$, $BC=16$, $EF=184$, and $FG=17$. Points $A, D, H, G$ lie on a circle, and we are tasked with finding the length of $CE$.

1. **Assigning Coordinates**:
   - Rectangle $ABCD$ is placed with $A(0,0)$, $B(107,0)$, $C(107,16)$, and $D(0,16)$.
   - Points $D(0,16)$, $E(e,16)$, $C(107,16)$, and $F(f,16)$ lie on the line $y=16$.

2. **Rectangle $EFGH$**:
   - Since $EF=184$, the horizontal distance between $E$ and $F$ is $|f - e| = 184$.
   - $FG=17$, so the vertical distance from $F(f,16)$ to $G(f,33)$ is 17.

3. **Circle Through Points $A, D, H, G$**:
   - Using the circle equation and solving for $f$, we find $f=187$ and $e=3$. Thus, $E$ is at $(3,16)$.

4. **Calculating $CE$**:
   - Point $C$ is at $(107,16)$, and point $E$ is at $(3,16)$. The distance $CE$ is the horizontal distance between them: $|107 - 3| = 104$.

Thus, the length of $CE$ is $\boxed{104}$.
