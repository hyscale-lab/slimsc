Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding the problem statement.

We have points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), the origin. A is at (1/2, 0), so that's halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0). B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is somewhere on the y-axis, a bit less than (0,1) because sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866.

These three points form a triangle, I think. O is the origin, A is on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. The line segment AB connects these two points in the first quadrant.

Now, there's a family F of segments PQ of unit length (so each PQ is 1 unit long). Each PQ lies in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So PQ is a segment from the x-axis to the y-axis, length 1, in the first quadrant.

The problem says there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that isn't on any of these segments PQ from F except for AB itself. So, C is the only point on AB (other than A and B) that isn't covered by any other PQ from the family F.

We need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q.

Alright, to approach this, I think I should first figure out the equation of line AB. Then, find the parametric form of points on AB. Then, for each point C on AB, determine whether it's on any of the PQ segments from F. Since C is unique and not on any other PQ except AB, we need to find the position where it's the only intersection.

Wait, but how do these PQ segments look? Each PQ is a segment from the x-axis to the y-axis, of length 1, in the first quadrant. So, if P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), then the distance between P and Q is sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. So p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Therefore, for each PQ in F, the point P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), with p and q satisfying p^2 + q^2 = 1, and p, q > 0 since we're in the first quadrant.

So the family F consists of all such segments PQ where p and q are positive, p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Now, for a given point C on AB, we need to check if there exists any PQ in F such that C lies on PQ, other than when PQ is AB itself. Since C is unique, we need to find a point C where the only PQ in F that contains it is AB.

So, I need to find point C on AB such that no other PQ from F passes through it.

Hmm, how can I model this? Maybe parametrize AB and then find the conditions under which a point C on AB is also on some other PQ.

First, let's find the equation of line AB.

Points A are (1/2, 0) and B are (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. To find c, plug in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Parametric equations for AB can be written as x = (1/2) - t*(1/2), y = 0 + t*(sqrt(3)/2), where t ranges from 0 to 1. Wait, no, maybe better to parameterize from O? Wait, no, AB is from A(1/2,0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So any point C on AB can be written as C = (1/2 - s*(1/2), 0 + s*(sqrt(3)/2)) where s ranges from 0 to 1. So that's C = ( (1 - s)/2, (s*sqrt(3))/2 ).

Alternatively, maybe a
