Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. We need to find Q + R.

Alright, so let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. We're looking for the greatest such number with a specific property. The property is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. That's interesting.

So, N is a four-digit number, let's denote it as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. A can't be zero because it's a four-digit number. Now, the condition is that if we change any one digit to 1, the new number is divisible by 7.

Let me think about what this implies. So, for each digit in N, if we replace it with 1, the number becomes a multiple of 7. So, we have four different numbers here, each differing from N by exactly one digit change to 1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

Hmm. So, for each digit position (thousands, hundreds, tens, units), changing that digit to 1 should result in a number divisible by 7.

I think the key here is to consider the number N modulo 7. If changing a digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7, then N must be congruent to something specific modulo 7, depending on which digit is changed.

Wait, let's formalize this. Let's denote N as the number ABCD, which is 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D.

If we change the thousands digit A to 1, the new number is 1BCD, which is 1000*1 + 100*B + 10*C + D. Let's call this number N_A.

Similarly, changing the hundreds digit B to 1 gives N_B = 1000*A + 100*1 + 10*C + D.

Changing the tens digit C to 1 gives N_C = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*1 + D.

Changing the units digit D to 1 gives N_D = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + 1.

Each of these N_A, N_B, N_C, N_D must be divisible by 7. So, N_A ≡ 0 mod 7, N_B ≡ 0 mod 7, N_C ≡ 0 mod 7, N_D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Now, let's express each of these in terms of N. Let's see:

N_A = 1000 + 100*B + 10*C + D = 1000 + (N - 1000*A). Because N is 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D, so N - 1000*A = 100*B + 10*C + D.

Similarly, N_B = 1000*A + 100 + 10*C + D = (N - 100*B) + 100.

N_C = 1000*A + 100*B + 10 + D = (N - 10*C) + 10.

N_D = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + 1 = (N - D) + 1.

So each of these can be written as:

N_A = 1000 + (N - 1000*A)
N_B = (N - 100*B) + 100
N_C = (N - 10*C) + 10
N_D = (N - D) + 1

And each of these must be ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, let's write the congruence conditions:

1. N_A ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ 1000 + (N - 1000*A) ≡ 0 mod 7
2. N_B ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ (N - 100*B) + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7
3. N_C ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ (N - 10*C) + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7
4. N_D ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ (N - D) + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Let me simplify each of these congruences.

Starting with the first one:

1. 1000 + (N - 1000*A) ≡ 0 mod 7
Let me compute 1000 mod 7. 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994 = 6 ⇒ 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

So, 6 + (N - 1000*A) ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ (N - 1000*A) ≡ -6 mod 7 ⇒ (N - 1000*A) ≡ 1 mod 7, since -6 ≡ 1 mod 7.

But N = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D. So, N - 1000*A = 100*B + 10*C + D. Let's denote this as X = 100*B + 10*C + D.

So, condition 1 becomes X ≡ 1 mod 7.

Similarly, for condition 2:

2. (N - 100*B) + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7

N - 100*B = 1000*A + 10*C + D. Let's denote this as Y = 1000*A + 10*C + D.

So, Y + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Let me compute 100 mod 7. 7*14=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

So, Y + 2 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ Y ≡ -2 mod 7 ⇒ Y ≡ 5 mod 7.

Similarly, condition 3:

3. (N - 10*C) + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7

N - 10*C = 1000*A + 100*B + D. Let's denote this as Z = 1000*A + 100*B + D.

So, Z + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3, so Z + 3 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ Z ≡ -3 mod 7 ⇒ Z ≡ 4 mod 7.

Condition 4:

4. (N - D) + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

N - D = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C. Let's denote this as W = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C.

So, W + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ W ≡ -1 mod 7 ⇒ W ≡ 6 mod 7.

So, to recap, we have four conditions:

1. X ≡ 1 mod 7, where X = 100*B + 10*C + D.
2. Y ≡ 5 mod 7, where Y = 1000*A + 10*C + D.
3. Z ≡ 4 mod 7, where Z = 1000*A + 100*B + D.
4. W ≡ 6 mod 7, where W = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C.

This is getting a bit complex, but maybe I can find relationships between these variables.

Let me see if I can relate these conditions. Let's think about how each of these expressions relates to N.

Wait, N = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D.

We can express X, Y, Z, W in terms of N:

X = 100*B + 10*C + D = N - 1000*A
Y = 1000*A + 10*C + D = N - 100*B
Z = 1000*A + 100*B + D = N - 10*C
W = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C = N - D

So, substituting these into the congruence conditions:

1. X ≡ 1 mod 7 ⇒ (N - 1000*A) ≡ 1 mod 7
2. Y ≡ 5 mod 7 ⇒ (N - 100*B) ≡ 5 mod 7
3. Z ≡ 4 mod 7 ⇒ (N - 10*C) ≡ 4 mod 7
4. W ≡ 6 mod 7 ⇒ (N - D) ≡ 6 mod 7

Wait, but N is a fixed number, and A, B, C, D are its digits. So each of these expressions is just N minus some digit
