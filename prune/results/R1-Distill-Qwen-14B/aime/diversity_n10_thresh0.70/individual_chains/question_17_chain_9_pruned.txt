Okay, so I've got this math problem about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any such box, and then express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, I have to find p + q. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex, but let's break it down.

First, let me visualize a rectangular box. It has three dimensions: length (let's say x), width (y), and height (z). The surface area of a rectangular box is given by the formula 2(xy + yz + xz), and the volume is xyz. The problem states that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23. So we have two equations:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54
2. xyz = 23

I can simplify the first equation by dividing both sides by 2, which gives me:

xy + yz + xz = 27

So now I have two equations:

1. xy + yz + xz = 27
2. xyz = 23

I need to find the minimal sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere that contains the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box because the sphere must touch the farthest corners of the box. The space diagonal of a rectangular box is given by the formula sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere is half of that, so:

r = (1/2) * sqrt(x² + y² + z²)

Hence, r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, my goal is to find the minimal possible value of (x² + y² + z²)/4, given the constraints on the surface area and volume.

Therefore, I need to minimize x² + y² + z², given that:

xy + yz + xz = 27
and
xyz = 23.

This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here, but maybe there's a simpler approach by using inequalities or symmetry.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I can express x² + y² + z² in terms of the given constraints. Let me recall that (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz). From the first equation, I know that xy + yz + xz = 27, so:

(x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 54

Therefore, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)² - 54

So, if I can express x + y + z, then I can find x² + y² + z². But I don't have a direct value for x + y + z.

I'm trying to think if there's a way to relate x + y + z to the volume or surface area. Maybe not directly, but perhaps by using inequalities.

Wait, let's think about the AM ≥ GM inequality. For positive real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean.

So, for x, y, z, we have:

(x + y + z)/3 ≥ (xyz)^(1/3)

Given that xyz = 23, so (xyz)^(1/3) = 23^(1/3).

Therefore,

x + y + z ≥ 3 * 23^(1/3)

But I don't know if that's directly useful. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or some other inequality to relate (x + y + z)² to (x² + y² + z²). Wait, I already have that (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 54, so if I can minimize (x + y + z), then I can minimize x² + y² + z².

Hmm, but how do I relate (x + y + z) to the given constraints?

Wait, another approach: Let me consider that for a given surface area and volume, the shape of the box that minimizes the space diagonal is when the box is as close to a cube as possible. Because a cube has the minimal space diagonal for a given volume and surface area. So perhaps the minimal r² occurs when x = y = z, but I should check if that's feasible.

Wait, but if x = y = z, then it's a cube. Let me check what the surface area and volume would be.

For a cube, surface area is 6x², so 6x² = 54 implies x² = 9, so x = 3. Then volume would be x³ = 27. But the problem states that the volume is 23, which is less than 27. So a cube isn't possible here because it would require a larger volume.

Therefore, the minimal space diagonal must correspond to a box that isn't a cube but is as close to a cube as possible given the constraints.

So, perhaps I can use Lagrange multipliers to minimize x² + y² + z² with the constraints.

Let me set up the Lagrangian. Let me denote f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z², which I want to minimize.

The constraints are:

g1(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz - 27 = 0
g2(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0

So, the Lagrangian would be:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ1(xy + yz + xz - 27) - λ2(xyz - 23)

To find the critical points, I need to take the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, and set them equal to zero.

Let's compute the partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ1(y + z) - λ2(yz) = 0
∂L/∂y = 2y - λ1(x + z) - λ2(xz) = 0
∂L/∂z = 2z - λ1(x + y) - λ2(xy) = 0

And the constraints:

xy + yz + xz = 27
xyz = 23

So, we have a system of five equations:

1. 2x = λ1(y + z) + λ2(yz)
2. 2y = λ1(x + z) + λ2(xz)
3. 2z = λ1(x + y) + λ2(xy)
4. xy + yz + xz = 27
5. xyz = 23

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can find a relationship between x, y, z by subtracting equations.

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

2y - 2x = λ1(x + z - y - z) + λ2(xz - yz)
Simplify:

2(y - x) = λ1(x - y) + λ2(z)(x - y)
Factor out (x - y):

2(y - x) = (x - y)(λ1 - λ2 z)
Multiply both sides by -1:

2(x - y) = (x - y)(λ1 - λ2 z)

If x ≠ y, then we can divide both sides by (x - y):

2 = λ1 - λ2 z
Similarly, doing the same for other pairs.

Similarly, subtract equation 1 from equation 3:

2z - 2x = λ1(x + y - y - z) + λ2(xy - yz)
Simplify:

2(z - x) = λ1(x - z) + λ2(y)(x - z)
Factor out (x - z):

2(z - x) = (x - z)(λ1 - λ2 y)
Multiply both sides by -1:

2(x - z) = (x - z)(λ1 - λ2 y)

If x ≠ z, then divide both sides by (x - z):

2 = λ1 - λ2 y

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 3:

2z - 2y = λ1(x + y - x - z) + λ2(xy - xz)
Simplify:

2(z - y) = λ1(y - z) + λ2 x (y - z)
Factor out (y - z):

2(z - y) = (y - z)(λ1 - λ2 x)
Multiply both sides by -1:

2(y - z) = (y - z)(λ1 - λ2 x)

If y ≠ z, then divide by (y - z):

2 = λ1 - λ2 x

So now, from the three subtractions, assuming x ≠ y, y ≠ z, x ≠ z, we get:

2 = λ1 - λ2 z  --> equation A

2 = λ1 - λ2 y  --> equation B

2 = λ1 - λ2 x  --> equation C

From equations A and B:

λ1 - λ2 z = λ1 - λ2 y

Which implies that λ2 z = λ2 y

Assuming λ2 ≠ 0, then z = y

Similarly, from equations A and C:

λ1 - λ2 z = λ1 - λ2 x

Which implies λ2 z = λ2 x

Again, if λ2 ≠ 0, then z = x

Therefore, z = y = x. So, x = y = z.

Wait, but earlier we saw that when x=y=z, the volume would be 27, but the given volume is 23. So this is a contradiction.

Hmm
