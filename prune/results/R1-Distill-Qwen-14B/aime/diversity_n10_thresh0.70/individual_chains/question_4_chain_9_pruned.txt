Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. It seems like a combinatorial game theory problem. The key is probably to find the winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win regardless of what the opponent does, and a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

Since Alice goes first, if the starting position n is a losing position, then Bob can win. So, I need to find all n ≤ 2024 such that n is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

Let me try to model this. Let's define a function f(n) where f(n) is true if the current player can win with n tokens, and false otherwise.

Base cases:
- f(0): Well, if there are zero tokens, the game is over. So the current player can't make a move and loses. So f(0) is false.
- f(1): The current player can take 1 token and win. So f(1) is true.
- f(2): Similarly, take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, but wait, no. If n=2, the current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Alternatively, can the current player take 4 tokens? No, because n=2. So the only move is to take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then wins. So f(2) is false because the current player can't win. Wait, no, if you take 1, opponent takes 1 and wins. So the current player can't force a win. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me think again. For n=2:

If it's my turn, I can take 1 token, leaving 1. Then the opponent can take that last token and win. So if I take 1, opponent wins. Alternatively, can I take 4? No, because there aren't enough. So I can't make a move that leaves the opponent in a losing position. Hence, f(2) is false. So n=2 is a losing position.

n=3: Let's see. I can take 1 token, leaving 2 for the opponent. Wait, n=2 is a losing position, so opponent would lose. So if I take 1, opponent is faced with n=2 which is a losing position. So the opponent can't win, so I win. So f(3) is true.

n=4: I can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So f(4) is true.

n=5: I can take 1 token, leaving 4 for the opponent. Since 4 is a winning position, the opponent can take 4 and win. Or, I can take 4 tokens, leaving 1. Then the opponent can take 1 and win. So both options lead to opponent winning. So f(5) is false.

Wait
