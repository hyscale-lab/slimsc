Okay, so I have this problem: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first, but maybe if I break it down, it'll make more sense.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies ω^13 = 1. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Wait, no, actually, the cyclotomic polynomial Φ₁₃(x) is (x¹³ - 1)/(x - 1) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.

The problem is asking about the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write that down:

P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

I need to compute this product and then find its remainder modulo 1000.

Hmm, maybe I can simplify the expression inside the product first. Let's look at the term for each k:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}

Can I factor this or rewrite it in a different way? Let me see. Maybe factor out a common term or recognize a pattern.

Let me denote ξ = ω^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2ξ + ξ².

So, 2 - 2ξ + ξ². Let me rearrange the terms:

ξ² - 2ξ + 2.

Wait, that's a quadratic in ξ. Maybe I can factor it or find its roots. Let me compute the discriminant:

Discriminant D = (−2)² − 4*1*2 = 4 − 8 = −4.

So, the roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i] / 2 = 1 ± i.

So, ξ² - 2ξ + 2 factors as (ξ - (1 + i))(ξ - (1 - i)).

Therefore, 2 - 2ξ + ξ² = (ξ - (1 + i))(ξ - (1 - i)).

So, substituting back ξ = ω^k, each term in the product becomes:

(ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Therefore, the entire product P is:

P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Which can be written as:

P = [∏_{k=0}^{12
