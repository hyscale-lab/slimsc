Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. Then, I have to compute r squared, express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the boxes are rectangular, so they have length, width, and height, which I can denote as x, y, z. The surface area of a rectangular box is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, and the volume is xyz = 23.

I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere must fit around the box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least as large as the space diagonal of the box. Because the sphere's diameter is the maximum distance between any two points in the box, which is the space diagonal. So, the radius r of the sphere will be half of that space diagonal.

Therefore, r = (sqrt(x² + y² + z²)) / 2, and so r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, my goal is to find the minimum possible value of r², which is equivalent to finding the minimum of (x² + y² + z²)/4 given the constraints 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Wait, but actually, the problem says the smallest sphere that can contain each of the boxes in set B. So, I think for each box in B, the sphere must be able to contain it. So, the sphere must be big enough to contain the box with the largest space diagonal in B. Therefore, I need to find the maximum possible space diagonal of boxes in B, and then the radius would be half of that maximum diagonal. Therefore, r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4, and I need to maximize (x² + y² + z²) given the surface area and volume constraints.

Wait, no. Wait, no, no. Wait a second. Let me think again. The question is about the smallest sphere that can contain each of the boxes in B. So, the sphere needs to be large enough to contain all boxes in B. So, the sphere must have a radius at least equal to the maximum possible space diagonal of any box in B divided by 2. So, the sphere's radius is determined by the box in B that requires the largest sphere. So, I need to find the maximum of sqrt(x² + y² + z²) over all boxes in B, then r is half that maximum, and then r² is (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, I need to maximize x² + y² + z² given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

So, perhaps I can use some inequalities or optimization techniques with constraints.

Let me write down the given:

We have variables x, y, z > 0.

Constraints:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 → xy + y
