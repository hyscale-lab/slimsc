Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The problem states that there's a list of positive integers with three key properties:

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9. That means 9 appears more frequently than any other number in the list.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.

I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items. Alright, let's tackle each property one by one and see how they can help me construct the list.

First, the sum is 30. So whatever numbers are in the list, when added together, they must total 30. Next, the mode is 9, and it's unique. So 9 must appear more times than any other number. That tells me that 9 has to be the most frequent number. So, I can start by thinking about how many 9s there are.

Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Hmm, that's interesting. The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If the median is a positive integer but doesn't appear in the list, that suggests that the median is between two numbers in the list, perhaps. Wait, no, the median itself has to be an integer, but it's not present in the list. So, how does that work?

Let me think. For example, if the list has an odd number of elements, say n is odd, then the median is the (n+1)/2 th term. But if it's not present, that would mean that the (n+1)/2 th term in the ordered list is a number that's not in the original list. Wait, that can't be because all the elements are in the list. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no. Wait, the median is a positive integer, but it doesn't appear in the list. So, the median is the middle value, but it's not one of the numbers in the list. That's a bit confusing because the median is usually one of the numbers if the list has an odd number of elements. But if the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which could be a non-integer, but in this case, it's a positive integer. So, for the median to be an integer but not present in the list, the list must have an even number of elements. Because with an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which can be an integer even if neither of the two middle numbers is that integer.

So, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is an integer and not present in the list. So that could be a scenario.

Wait, but let's make sure. Let's think about the list's structure.

Let me outline what I know:
