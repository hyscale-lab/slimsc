Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel, and there's a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon. Hmm, okay, let me digest this.

First, let me visualize the hexagon. It's convex and equilateral, so all sides are equal in length. Also, opposite sides are parallel. That makes me think of a hexagon that might be similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily regular since it's not stated. In a regular hexagon, all sides are equal and all angles are equal, but here, it's just equilateral, so angles could vary as long as opposite sides are parallel.

Since the hexagon has opposite sides parallel, that might mean it's a type of affine-regular hexagon or something similar. But I'm not sure about the exact terminology here. Maybe I can think about the properties of such a hexagon.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. I think that when they say extensions of AB, CD, and EF form a triangle, they're talking about extending those sides until they meet, forming a larger triangle. So, if I imagine the hexagon inscribed inside this triangle, touching each side, and the sides of the hexagon are equal in length.

I remember that in such cases, especially with regular polygons, there's often a relationship between the side lengths of the polygon and the sides of the triangle formed by extending its sides. Maybe I can use similar triangles or some proportionality here.

Let me try to draw a rough sketch in my mind. The hexagon is inside the triangle, and each pair of opposite sides is parallel to a side of the triangle. So, each side of the hexagon is parallel to one side of the triangle. Since the hexagon is equilateral, each side is the same length, let's say 's'.

Wait, but the triangle has sides 200, 240, and 300. Let me check if this is a right-angled triangle. Let's see: 200² + 240² = 40,000 + 57,600 = 97,600. And 300² is 90,000. So, no, it's not a right-angled triangle. Hmm.

But perhaps the triangle is similar to some smaller triangles formed by the hexagon?

Another thought: since the hexagon is equilateral and the opposite sides are parallel, the distances between the opposite sides should be consistent. Maybe the triangle can be divided into smaller sections by the hexagon, each section corresponding to the length 's' of the hexagon's sides.

Wait, perhaps this is a problem that involves homothety. Homothety is a transformation that enlarges or reduces a figure by a scale factor relative to a point. If the hexagon is similar to the triangle but scaled down, maybe
