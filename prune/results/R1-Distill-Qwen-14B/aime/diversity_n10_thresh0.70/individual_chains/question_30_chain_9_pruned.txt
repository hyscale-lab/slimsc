Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where ω is a 13th root of unity and ω isn't equal to 1. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially since they're solutions to the equation x^n = 1. In this case, n is 13, so ω^13 = 1. That might come in handy later. Also, ω^k for k from 0 to 12 gives all the distinct 13th roots of unity.

The expression we're dealing with is a product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write that down more clearly:

Product = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

I wonder if I can factor this expression or perhaps find a pattern. Since we're multiplying terms involving ω^k, maybe there's a way to relate this product to some polynomial evaluated at specific points.

Wait, another thought: since ω is a root of unity, maybe I can express ω^{2k} in terms of ω^k. Let me see, ω^{2k} is just (ω^k)^2. So, the term in the product becomes 2 - 2ω^k + (ω^k)^2. That looks like a quadratic in ω^k.

Let me write that quadratic as:

(ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2

Wait, no, that's not right. The original term is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} which is the same as 2 - 2ω^k + (ω^k)^2. So, arranging terms:

(ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2.

Hmm, so each term in the product is a quadratic in ω^k. Maybe I can consider the product over all ω^k of this quadratic.

But since ω^k are all the 13th roots of unity, except when k=0, ω^0=1. Wait, no, in the product, we are including k=0 as well. So, when k=0, ω^0 = 1. Let me compute the term for k=0 separately.

For k=0: 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is 1. So, the product is 1 multiplied by the product for k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Now, for k=1 to 12, each ω^k is a primitive 13th root of unity because ω isn't equal to 1, and since 13 is prime
