Okay, so I need to solve this problem about finding the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. The set B consists of boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. The radius squared will be a fraction p/q, and I need to find p + q.

First, let me get the problem straight. We have rectangular boxes, so they have length, width, and height, say x, y, z. The surface area is 54, and the volume is 23. The goal is to find the smallest sphere that can contain any such box. The sphere's radius would then be half the space diagonal of the box because the sphere must enclose the entire box, so the diagonal will pass through the center of the sphere, and the radius is half of that.

So, the space diagonal of a box with sides x, y, z is sqrt(x² + y² + z²), which would be the diameter of the sphere. So, radius r is (sqrt(x² + y² + z²))/2, so r² is (x² + y² + z²)/4.

Therefore, I need to minimize x² + y² + z², given that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23.

That makes sense. So the problem reduces to minimizing x² + y² + z² with constraints:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 (surface area)
2. xyz = 23 (volume)

So, I can write the surface area as 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, so xy + yz + xz = 27.

I need to minimize x² + y² + z² subject to these constraints.

I think this is a problem that can be solved using Lagrange multipliers, but since it's a symmetric function, maybe there's a way to use AM-QM or other inequalities.

Wait, but the problem is to find the minimum of x² + y² + z² given that the surface area is fixed and volume is fixed. So, it's a constrained optimization problem.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Let me denote S = x² + y² + z², which I need to minimize.

Constraints:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 => xy + yz + xz = 27.

2. xyz = 23.

So, we have two equations and three variables. So, perhaps I can express one variable in terms of the others and substitute.

Alternatively, maybe I can use some symmetric substitutions.

Let me consider that for a box, the space diagonal squared is x² + y² + z², which is S. So, to minimize S, given the surface area and volume.

I remember that for problems involving symmetric functions, sometimes assuming that two variables are equal can help find the minimal or maximal values. Maybe in this case, the minimal S occurs when two variables are equal.

So, let me assume that x = y, and see if that leads us somewhere.

If x = y, then our constraints become:

First, the surface area:

xy + yz + xz = x² + 2xz = 27.

The volume:

x² z = 23.

So, from volume, z = 23/(x²).

Substitute into surface area:

x² + 2x*(23/x²) = x² + (46/x) = 27.

So, x² + 46/x = 27.

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate denominator:

x³ + 46 = 27x.

Bring all terms to left:

x³ -27x +46 =0.

Now, we have a cubic equation: x³ -27x +46=0.

I need to find real positive roots of this equation.

Let me try rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Let me test x=2:

2³ -27*2 +46 =8 -54 +46= (8+46)-54=54-54=0. Oh, so x=2 is a root.

So, we can factor the cubic as (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23)=0.

Let me perform the division:

Divide x³ -27x +46 by x-2.

Using polynomial division or synthetic division.

Using synthetic division with root 2:

Coefficients: 1 (x³), 0 (x²), -27 (x), 46 (constant).

Bring down 1.

Multiply 1 *2=2, add to next coefficient: 0 +2=2.

Multiply 2*2=4, add to next
