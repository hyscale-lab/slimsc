Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand it first.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. The question is about finding the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This probability is expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we have to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize automatically means she has at least two numbers correct, A is a subset of B. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, the probability we're looking for is P(A)/P(B).

So, I need to compute P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize, and P(B), the probability of winning any prize (at least two numbers correct). Then, divide P(A) by P(B) to get the required probability.

First, let me figure out how many possible ways there are for the lottery. Since Jen picks 4 numbers out of 10, and the lottery also picks 4 numbers, the total number of possible lottery outcomes is C(10,4), where C(n,k) is the combination formula.

Calculating C(10,4): 10!/(4! * 6!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, there are 210 possible sets of 4 numbers that the lottery can choose.

Now, P(A) is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers match the lottery numbers. Since there's only one specific set that matches Jen's numbers, the number of favorable outcomes is 1. Therefore, P(A) = 1/210.

Next, I need to find P(B), the probability that Jen wins a prize, which is when at least two of her numbers are chosen in the lottery. This can be calculated using the complement rule. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of ways that exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four numbers match, and sum those up.

Wait, but since she can't win a prize unless she has at least two correct, so P(B) = (number of ways to have exactly 2 correct + exactly 3 correct + exactly 4 correct)/total number of possible lottery outcomes.

Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to compute 1 minus the probability of having fewer than two correct numbers. Let me consider both approaches.

Approach 1: Compute the number of ways to have exactly k correct numbers, for k=2,3,4, and sum them up.

Approach 2: Compute 1 - [probability of exactly 0 correct + probability of exactly 1 correct].

I think either approach is manageable. Let me try Approach 1.

So, for exactly k correct numbers, where k=2,3,4.

For each k, the number of ways is C(4,k) * C(6,4−k). Wait, let me explain. Jen has 4 numbers, and the lottery has 4 numbers.

If exactly k of Jen's numbers are in the lottery, then the remaining (4 - k) numbers in the lottery must come from the numbers not chosen by Jen. Since Jen picked 4 numbers, there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers not chosen by her. So, the lottery must choose k numbers from Jen's 4 and (4 - k) numbers from the other 6.

So, the number of favorable outcomes for exactly k correct is C(4,k) * C(6,4−k). Then, sum these for k=2,3,4.

Let me calculate each term:

For k=2: C(4,2) * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

For k=3: C(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

For k=4: C(4,4) * C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

Adding them up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

So, the number of favorable outcomes for winning a prize is 115.

Therefore, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Wait, let me confirm that with Approach 2 to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Approach 2: Compute 1 - [prob of 0 correct + prob of 1 correct].

Compute number of ways for 0 correct: all 4 numbers in the lottery are from the 6 numbers not chosen by Jen. So, C(6,4) = 15.

Number of ways for 1 correct: C(4,1) * C(6,3). So, 4 * 20 = 80.

So, total ways for 0 or 1 correct: 15 + 80 = 95.

Thus, the number of ways for at least 2 correct is total possible (210) minus 95, which is 115. So, same as before. So, P(B) = 115/210.

Therefore, P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B) = (1/210)/(115/210) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps.

Wait, so P(A) is the probability she gets all four correct, which is 1/210. P(B) is 115/210. So, when we take the ratio, the denominators (210) cancel out, giving 1/115.

Is that right? It seems so.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of counting the number of favorable outcomes for A and B.

Since A is a subset of B, the number of favorable outcomes for A is 1 (all four correct). The number of favorable outcomes for B is 115 (as computed). So, the conditional probability is 1/115.

Hence, m = 1, n = 115. Are they coprime? Yes, since 115 factors into 5*23, and 1 shares no common factors other than 1. So, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Is P(B) correctly calculated?

Wait, 115/210 reduces to 23/42, but in the problem statement, it's phrased as m/n where m and n are coprime. But in the conditional probability, we have 1/115, which is already in simplest terms.

So, m is 1 and n is 115. Therefore, m + n is 116.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure that the 115 is correct. So, in the initial calculation, for exactly two correct: 4C2 *6C2=6*15=90. Exactly three:4C3*6C1=4*6=24. Exactly four:1. So, 90+24+1=115. That seems right.

Alternatively, the total number of possible lotteries is 210. The number of lotteries that have at least two numbers matching Jen's is 115. So, that's correct.

So, yes, P(B) is 115/210, which simplifies to 23/42, but in the conditional probability, we're dividing P(A) by P(B), so 1/210 divided by 115/210 is 1/115. So, you're correct.

Therefore, the probability is 1/115, so m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.


To solve the problem, we need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem where we use the formula \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \). Here, \( A \) is the event of winning the grand prize (all four numbers match), and \( B \) is the event of winning a prize (at least two numbers match).

1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

2. **Probability of Winning the Grand Prize (\( P(A) \))**: There is only one way for all four of Jen's numbers to match the lottery numbers, so \( P(A) = \frac{1}{210} \).

3. **Probability of Winning a Prize (\( P(B) \))**: This is the probability of having at least two correct numbers. We calculate this by summing the number of ways to have exactly 2, 3, or 4 correct numbers:
   - Exactly 2 correct: \( \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{6}{2} = 6 \times 15 = 90 \)
   - Exactly 3 correct: \( \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{6}{1} = 4 \times 6 = 24 \)
   - Exactly 4 correct: \( \binom{4}{4} \times \binom{6}{0} = 1 \times 1 = 1 \)
   - Total favorable outcomes: \( 90 + 24 + 1 = 115 \)
   - Thus, \( P(B) = \frac{115}{210} \).

4. **Conditional Probability**: 
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115}
   \]
   Here, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \), which are coprime.

5. **Final Answer**: \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

\boxed{116}
