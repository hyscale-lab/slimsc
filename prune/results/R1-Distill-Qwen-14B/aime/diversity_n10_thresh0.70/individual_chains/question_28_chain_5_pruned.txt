Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are equal. I need to find this distance, which can be written as mâˆšn / p, where m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, add m + n + p for the answer.

Hmm, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter in a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is called the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

To find the inradius, I think the formula is related to the volume and the surface area. Wait, in a tetrahedron, the inradius r is equal to 3 times the volume divided by the sum of the areas of the four faces. So, r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all faces). That makes sense because, in a way, it's analogous to the inradius in a triangle, where r = A / s, with A being the area and s the semi-perimeter. But here, instead of semi-perimeter, we have the total surface area, and we multiply by 3 because it's a 3D object.

So, my plan is to compute the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S, then compute r as 3V divided by S.

First, let's figure out the surface area. Each face is a triangle, and each pair of opposite edges has the same length. For example, AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD. So, all four faces are congruent triangles? Wait, no, because even though opposite edges are equal, the triangles might not necessarily be congruent. Wait, let's double-check.

Wait, each face is a triangle with sides of lengths sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Wait, no, that can't be right. Because each face is a triangle, but for each face, the three edges would be three different lengths. Let's see:

Take face ABC: the edges are AB, AC, BC. AB is sqrt(41), AC is sqrt(80), BC is sqrt(89). So, the triangle ABC has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Similarly, face ABD has edges AB, AD, BD. AB is sqrt(41), AD is sqrt(89), BD is sqrt(80). So, same side lengths as ABC. Similarly, faces ACD and BCD will also have the same side lengths. So, all four faces are congruent triangles.

Wait, so each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, I can compute the area of one face and then multiply by four to get the total surface area.

So, first, let me compute the area of one face. Let's pick triangle ABC with sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89). I'll use Heron's formula.

First, compute the semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c) / 2.

So, s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.

Hmm, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area using vectors or coordinates, but perhaps another approach would be better. Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the area based on vectors if I can find the coordinates of the points.

Wait, perhaps I can model this tetrahedron in 3D space. Since all opposite edges are equal,
