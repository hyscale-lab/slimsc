Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but a certain distance away from the center.

In this case, the torus T has a circle with radius 3. The axis is 6 units away from the center of this circle. So, when you revolve this circle around that axis, you get the torus.

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The torus can rest inside the sphere and be tangent to it along a circle, which gives us r_i, and it can also rest outside the sphere and be tangent along another circle, giving us r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a reduced fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, let's break it down. I think I need to find the radii of the circles where the torus is tangent to the sphere in both the internal and external cases.

First, let me recall some properties of a torus. The torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In this problem, R is 6 and r is 3.

So, torus T has R = 6 and r = 3.

Sphere S has radius 11. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's touching along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's touching along another circle.

I think the key here is to find the points of tangency between the sphere and the torus. Since both are surfaces of revolution, their points of tangency should lie along a circle that's also a circle of latitude or something similar.

Wait, but the torus is more complicated. Let me think about the equations.

Maybe I can model the torus and the sphere mathematically and then find the points where they intersect tangentially.

The equation of a torus in 3D can be written in several ways. One common form is:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r²

Where R is the major radius and r is the minor radius.

In our case, R = 6 and r = 3, so the equation becomes:

(√(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 9

The sphere S has radius 11, centered at the origin, I assume. So its equation is:

x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, they touch along a circle where their surfaces just meet. Similarly, when the torus is outside, they touch along another circle.

But wait, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the point of tangency would be on the outer part of the torus, and when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, so the tangency would be on the inner part of the torus.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the generating circle of the torus, and then use some geometric relationships.

Wait, the torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from its center. So the center of the generating circle is 6 units away from the axis. The sphere is centered at the origin, I think.

Wait, when the torus is resting inside the sphere, the sphere's center is at the same point as the torus's center? Because if the torus is centered at the origin, then the sphere is also centered there.

So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the point of
