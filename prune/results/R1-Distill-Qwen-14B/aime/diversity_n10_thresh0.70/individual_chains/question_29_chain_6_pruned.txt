Okay, so I've got this geometry problem about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The problem says that points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let me visualize the problem. There are two rectangles, so ABCD and EFGH. Since they're rectangles, all the angles are right angles. Points D, E, C, F are on the same straight line. So, maybe they're placed in such a way that E is somewhere between D and C, and F is another point on the line beyond C or maybe between E and C? Wait, I'm not sure yet.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. That might come into play with some cyclic quadrilateral properties, like opposite angles summing to 180 degrees, or maybe using the power of a point.

Given the sides: BC is 16, so since ABCD is a rectangle, BC is one side, so BC=AD=16. AB is 107, so AB=CD=107. Similarly, FG=17, and EF=184. Since EFGH is a rectangle, FG=EH=17, and EF=GH=184.

Wait, so EF is 184, which is the same as GH. Let me think about how these rectangles are placed.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, let me try drawing a rough sketch. Let's consider line DC, which is of length BC=16? Wait, no, BC is 16, AB is 107, so ABCD is a rectangle with sides 16 and 107. So, AB is 107, BC is 16, so AD is 16, DC is 107.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides FG=17 and EF=184. So, EF is 184, FG is 17, so GH is 184, HE is 17.

Now, points D, E
