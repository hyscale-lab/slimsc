Okay, so I've got this problem here: there's a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola and form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

So, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola as well. That makes sense because hyperbola is symmetric about the origin. So, points A, B, C, D are arranged such that their diagonals pass through the origin.

Given this, I can model the points as being symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C, which is opposite to A, would be (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D would be some other points on the hyperbola that are symmetric with respect to the origin.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, which they do here at the origin. So, the coordinates of the points are such that A and C are at opposite ends of one diagonal, and B and D are at opposite ends of the other diagonal.

So, the diagonals are AC and BD. Since diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint for both diagonals.

So, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. So, A is (x, y), C is (-x, -y), B is (p, q), D is (-p, -q). All four points lie on the hyperbola.

So, the hyperbola equation is x²/20 - y
