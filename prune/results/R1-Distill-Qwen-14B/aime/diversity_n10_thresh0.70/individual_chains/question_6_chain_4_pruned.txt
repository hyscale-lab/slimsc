Okay, so I've got this math problem here that I need to solve. It's about finding the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are defined as y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what f(x) and g(x) are. The problem says f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. So, both f and g are functions that take the absolute value of x, subtract either 1/2 or 1/4, and then take the absolute value again. That means both f and g are V-shaped graphs, but with different shifts.

Let me sketch f(x) and g(x) mentally. For f(x): the inner absolute value |x| creates a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2 would shift this V upwards by 1/2, so the vertex moves to (0, 1/2). But then taking the absolute value again, ||x| - 1/2|, would reflect any negative parts back up. Wait, does that happen here? Let me think. If |x| - 1/2 is negative, then taking its absolute value would flip it. So for |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) becomes 1/2 - |x|. That means f(x) is a V-shape that peaks at (0, 1/2) and then slopes downward on both sides until it hits zero at |x| = 1/2, and then continues as a V again beyond that. So f(x) is like a W shape, with peaks at 1/2 and valleys at 0 for |x| between -1/2 and 1/2, and then V-shape again beyond that.

Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. Following the same logic, the inner |x| gives a V, subtract 1/4, then take absolute value. So for |x| < 1/4, it becomes 1/4 - |x|, and for |x| >=1/4, it's |x| - 1/4. So g(x) is also a W shape but with peaks at 1/4 and valleys at 0 between -1/4 and 1/4, and then V-shape beyond that.

So, both f and g have these W-like shapes, but f is shifted higher (1/2) and g is shifted lower (1/4). Now, the functions y and x are defined in terms of these f and g.

The first function is y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let me parse that. So, we start with sin(2πx), which is a sine wave with period 1 (since the period of sin(2πx) is 2π/(2π) = 1). So, it's a sine wave that goes from 0 to 1, back to 0, down to -1, and back to 0 over each interval of length 1.

Then, we apply f to this sine wave. So, f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Since sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. So, f(sin(2πx)) will first subtract 1/2 from |sin(2πx)|, which for |sin| >=1/2, remains positive, but for |sin| <1/2, becomes negative and then is taken as positive again.

So, the graph of f(sin(2πx)) would take the original sine wave, take its absolute value, subtract 1/2, take absolute value again. So, for |sin(2πx)| >=1/2, f(sin) is |sin| -1/2, and for |sin| <1/2, it's 1/2 - |sin|.

Then, we apply g to this result. So, g(f(sin(2πx))) = ||f(sin(2πx))| - 1/4|. Since f(sin(...)) is always non-negative, because it's an absolute value, the inner absolute is redundant, so it's |f(...) - 1/4|.

So, g(f(...)) = |f(...) - 1/4|.

Finally, multiplying by 4, so y = 4 * |f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4|.

Wait, let me make sure. The function is y=4g(f(sin(2πx))). So, that's 4 * g(f(sin(...))).

Given that g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|, so g(f(...)) = | |f(...) | - 1/4 |, but f(...) is already non-negative, so it's |f(...) - 1/4|.

Hence, y = 4 * |f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4|.

So, now, f(sin(2πx)) is || |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |. Let me think about this.

Let me consider the possible values of |sin(2πx)|. It's between 0 and 1. So, |sin(2πx)| is in [0,1].

So, f(sin(...)) = | |sin(...) | - 1/2 |. Let me denote s = |sin(2πx)|, so s is in [0,1].

Then, f(s) = |s - 1/2|. So f(s) will be 1/2 - s when s <1/2, and s -1/2 when s >=1/2. So, f(s) is a V-shape with vertex at s=1/2, going up on both sides.

So, f(s) is in [0, 1/2]. Because when s=0, f(s)=1/2; when s=1/2, f(s)=0; when s=1, f(s)=1/2.

So, f(s) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Then, g(f(s)) = |f(s) - 1/4|. Since f(s) is in [0,1/2], f(s) -1/4 ranges from -1/4 to 1/4.

So, g(f(s)) = |f(s) - 1/4|.

Which means, when f(s) >=1/4, it's f(s) -1/4, which is in [0, 1/4], and when f(s) <1/4, it's 1/4 - f(s), also in [0,1/4].

So, g(f(s)) is a V-shape with vertex at f(s)=1/4, which is at s= 1/2 ±1/4, since f(s)=1/4 happens when |s-1/2|=1/4, so s=1/2 ±1/4, so s= 3/4 or 1/4.

So, f(s) is 1/4 when s=1/4 or s=3/4.

So, g(f(s)) will be zero when f(s)=1/4, which is at s=1/4 and s=3/4, and increases as f(s) moves away from 1/4 towards 0 or 1/2.

Wait, no, when f(s) is 0, g(f(s)) is |0 -1/4| =1/4, which is the maximum.

So, the graph of g(f(s)) has maximums at s=0 and
