Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, meaning they all lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. That's interesting because if four points lie on a circle, they're concyclic or lie on the same circumference, which might imply some cyclic quadrilateral properties.

Given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, I should probably sketch this out to get a clearer picture. Let me imagine rectangle ABCD. Since it's a rectangle, all angles are right angles, and opposite sides are equal. So, AB is 107, which would make CD also 107. BC is 16, so AD and BC are both 16.

Now, rectangle EFGH. Since EF is 184 and FG is 17, that means EF is one side and FG is another. So, in rectangle EFGH, EF = 184 and FG = 17. Thus, EH would be 17 and HG would be 184.

The points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, they all lie on a straight line, let's say line DF. Since D and C are corners of rectangle ABCD, which are adjacent, I think D is connected to C via DC. Similarly, E and F are connected via EF in rectangle EFGH.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's D, E, C, F that are collinear. So, the order on the line must be D, then E, then C, then F? Or could it be a different order? Hmm.

Wait, ABCD is a rectangle, so the order of the vertices is such that AB is adjacent to BC, which is adjacent to CD, etc. So, points are arranged in order A, B, C, D, right? So, in rectangle ABCD, the points go A-B-C-D-A.

Similarly, in rectangle EFGH, the points are E-F-G-H-E.

So, D is a corner of ABCD, and E is a corner of EFGH. So, the line DF passes through E and C. So, the line goes D, E, C, F.

That makes sense because then E is between D and C, and F is beyond C. So, the line is D-E-C-F.

Now, the other condition is that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic. That's the key here, maybe.

Since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, we can use some cyclic quadrilateral properties. One important property is that the product of the lengths of the diagonals can be related to the sum of the products of opposite sides, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the power of a point theorem. Or perhaps find similar triangles or use
