Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and I'm going to walk through my thought process step by step. Here's the problem again:

Let \( p \) be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Find the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

I need to find two things: first, the smallest prime \( p \) where \( p^2 \) divides some \( n^4 + 1 \), and then the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

Hmm, so let me break this down. I think I should start by understanding when \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \). That means \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \). So, \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \). 

First, I need to find the smallest prime \( p \) for which such an \( n \) exists. Then, once I find that \( p \), I need to find the smallest \( m \) that satisfies the same condition.

I remember that for primes \( p \), if \( -1 \) is a quartic residue modulo \( p \), then there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \). But this is modulo \( p \), not \( p^2 \). So, maybe I need to find primes where \( -1 \) is a quartic residue modulo \( p^2 \).

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to start with small primes and check if such \( n \) exists. Let's list the primes in order and check each one.

Starting with the smallest primes:

1. \( p = 2 \). Let's see if there's an \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \).

Testing \( n = 1 \): \( 1^4 + 1 = 2 \), which is not divisible by 4.

Testing \( n = 2 \): \( 16 + 1 = 17 \), not divisible by 4. Wait, but 17 mod 4 is 1, so no. Hmm, but wait, let me think. Since 2 is the prime, maybe there's no such \( n \) because \( n^4 \) mod 4 cycles:

- \( n \) even: \( n = 2k \), \( n^4 = 16k^4 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \). So, \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \), which can't be 0 mod 4.

- \( n \) odd: \( n = 2k + 1 \), \( n^4 = (2k+1)^4 \). Let's compute mod 4:

\( (2k + 1)^4 = 16k^4 + 32k^3 + 24k^2 + 8k + 1 \). All terms except the last are multiples of 4, so mod 4, it's 1. So, \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \mod 4 \), which isn't 0. Therefore, for \( p = 2 \), there's no \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by 4. So, p=2 is out.

2. Next prime is 3. Let's check if \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 9 \).

Possible \( n \) mod 3: 0,1,2.

Compute \( n^4 \mod 9 \):

- \( n \equiv 0 \mod
