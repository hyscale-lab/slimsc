Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to fill a 2x3 grid with digits (0-9) in each cell. The conditions are that when I read the numbers left to right, the sum is 999, and when I read them top to bottom, the sum is 99. The example given is:

0 0 8
9 9 1

Which works because 0 + 991 = 991, wait, no, wait, 0 + 991 is 991, but the sum should be 999. Hmm, maybe I misread. Oh wait, wait, the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999. Let me check the example again. The top row is 008, which is 8 as a number? Or is it 008 considered as 8? And the bottom row is 991, which is 991. So 8 + 991 = 999, which is correct. For the vertical sums, the first column is 0 and 9, which sums to 9, the second column is 0 and 9, also 9, and the third column is 8 and 1, which is 9. So 9 + 9 + 9 = 27? Wait, no, the problem says the sum is 99. Wait, that doesn't add up. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the vertical sum. Let me read the problem again.

Ah, the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom. Wait, each column is a number? So each column has two digits, top and bottom, so each column is a two-digit number. So for the example, the columns are:

First column: 0 and 9 → 09, which is 9
Second column: 0 and 9 → 09, which is 9
Third column: 8 and 1 → 81, which is 81
So 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. Okay, that makes sense. So each column is treated as a two-digit number, and their sum is 99.

So, my grid has two rows and three columns. Each cell is a digit. Let me represent the grid as:
