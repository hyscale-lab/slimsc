Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I have to find the smallest positive integer m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I know that for primes p, if p divides n⁴ +1, then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p. That comes from Fermat's little theorem, right? Because n^(p-1) ≡ 1 mod p if n and p are coprime. So, the order of n modulo p must divide 8. But in this case, since n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, squaring both sides gives n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p. So the order of n modulo p is 8, which means that 8 divides p-1, because the order must divide p-1. So p ≡ 1 mod 8. That tells me that primes like 17, 97, etc., might be candidates.

But wait, the question is about p² dividing n⁴ +1. So it's not just that p divides n⁴ +1, but p² does as well. I remember that for primes p, if p divides n⁴ +1, then p² might divide n⁴ +1 under certain conditions. I think I need to look into the concept of Wieferich primes or something related to higher power divisibility.

Alternatively, maybe using Hensel's lemma could help. Hensel's lemma is about lifting solutions modulo p to modulo higher powers of p. So if n is a solution to n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, then under certain conditions, we can lift it to a solution modulo p². But I think Hensel's lemma applies when the derivative of the function at the root isn't zero. Let me think: the function here is f(n) = n⁴ +1. The derivative is f’(n)=4n³. So when is 4n³ ≡ 0 mod p? Well, if p ≠ 2, because 4 is invertible mod p otherwise. So for odd primes, f’(n) is zero only when n ≡ 0 mod p. But
