Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have a torus T made by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's in the plane of the circle, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. So, it's like a donut shape. Then, there's a sphere S with radius 11.

When T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent to S along a circle with radius r_i. When T rests on the outside, it's externally tangent to S along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to find the radii of the circles along which the torus is tangent to the sphere, both internally and externally, and then compute their difference.

First, let me recall what a torus is. A torus can be described as a surface of revolution generated by rotating a circle around an external axis. The standard equation of a torus in 3D coordinates is (sqrt(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r², where R is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and r is the radius of the generating circle.

In this case, R is 6 and r is 3. So, the equation of the torus T is (sqrt(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 3², which simplifies to (sqrt(x² + y²) - 6)^2 + z² = 9.

Now, the sphere S has a radius of 11. Its equation would be x² + y² + z² = 11², or x² + y² + z² = 121.

We need to find the circles of tangency when T is inside S and when T is outside S.

Wait, when T is inside S, it's tangent internally. So, imagine the torus is sitting inside the sphere, touching it along a circle. Similarly, when T is outside, it's tangent externally.

I think the key here is to find the points where the torus and the sphere are tangent to each other, meaning their surfaces touch at exactly one point in each cross-sectional slice, perhaps? Or maybe along a circle. So, the locus of points where both surfaces meet and their normals are equal (i.e., the tangent planes are the same) would form a circle.

But maybe it's easier to visualize in cross-section. Let's consider the cross-section in the plane z = 0. Since both the torus and the sphere are symmetric around the z-axis, their cross-sections in this plane will be two-dimensional figures.

In the z=0 cross-section, the torus becomes a circle of radius 3, centered at (6, 0). Wait, no. Wait, the cross-section of the torus in the plane of revolution (the xy-plane) is actually a circle of radius 3, but offset by 6 units from the origin. So, in the xy-plane, the cross-section of T is a circle with center at (6, 0) and radius 3. The sphere's cross-section is a circle with radius 11 centered at the origin (0,0).

So, in the xy-plane, the sphere is x² + y² = 121, and the torus's cross-section is (x - 6)^2 + y² = 9.

Now, when the torus rests inside the sphere, they are tangent internally. That would mean the torus is just fitting inside the sphere, touching it along a circle. Similarly, when resting outside, the torus is outside the sphere, touching it along another circle.

Wait, but the torus is a 3D object. When we talk about
