Okay, so I have this problem about a 2x3 grid where I need to place digits in each cell. The conditions are that when I read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed should add up to 999. Also, when I read the grid top to bottom, the three numbers formed should add up to 99. Hmm, let me try to understand this.

First, the grid is 2 rows by 3 columns. So, when reading left to right, each row will form a three-digit number. The top row is the first number, and the bottom row is the second number. Their sum should be 999. 

Similarly, reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. The first column is the first number, the second column is the second number, and the third column is the third number. Their sum should be 99.

Let me visualize the grid:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\ \hline
d & e & f \\ \hline
\end{array}
\]

So, the first number is the top row: abc (which is 100a + 10b + c), and the second number is the bottom row: def (100d + 10e + f). Their sum is 999.

So, (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

Also, when reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number: ad, be, cf. So the numbers are 10a + d, 10b + e, 10c + f. Their sum is 99.

So, (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Let me write down these equations:

1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
2. 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Hmm, maybe I can manipulate these equations to find relationships between the variables.

Let me subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99

Simplify the left side:

100a -10a = 90a
10b -10b = 0
c -10c = -9c
100d -d = 99d
10e -e =9e
f - f =0

So overall, 90a -9c +99d +9e = 900

Divide both sides by 9:

10a - c +11d + e = 100

Hmm, that's one equation. Let me note this as equation 3:

10a - c +11d + e = 100

Now, let me look at equation 2 again:

10a + d + 10b + e +10c + f =99

Let me rearrange it:

10a +10b +10c + d + e + f =99

I can factor 10 from the first three terms:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) =99

So, equation 2a: 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) =99

And equation 1 is (100a +10b +c) + (100d +10e +f)=999.

Wait, let me think about how to combine these. Maybe express (a + b + c) and (d + e + f) in terms of something.

Let me denote S = a + b + c, T = d + e + f.

Then, equation 2a becomes 10S + T =99.

So, 10S + T=99. That means T =99 -10S.

But T is d + e + f, which are digits, so each is between 0 and 9, inclusive. So, the minimum value of T is 0+0+0=0, maximum is 9+9+9=27.

Similarly, S is a + b + c, also digits, so S can be from 0+0+0=0 to 9+9+9=27.

From equation 2a: T=99-10S.

Since T must be between 0 and 27, 99 -10S must be in [0,27].

So, 0 ≤ 99 -10S ≤27.

Let's solve for S:

First, 99 -10S ≥0 → 10S ≤99 → S ≤9.9. Since S is an integer, S ≤9.

Second, 99 -10S ≤27 → 99 -27 ≤10S →72 ≤10S → S ≥7.2. So S ≥8 (since S is integer).

So S must be 8 or 9.

Case 1: S=8.

Then T=99-10*8=99-80=19.

Case 2: S=9.

Then T=99-10*9=99-90=9.

So, only two possibilities: S=8 and T=19, or S=9 and T=9.

Now, let's consider each case.

First, let's handle equation 3: 10a -c +11d + e =100.

I can write this as 10a +11d + e = c +100.

But since c is a digit, 0 ≤c ≤9.

So, c +100 ≤9 +100=109.

Thus, 10a +11d + e ≤109.

Also, since a, d are digits (0-9), but a is the first digit of a 3-digit number, so a can't be 0. Similarly, d is the first digit of a 3-digit number (def), so d can't be 0.

So, a and d are from 1 to 9.

Let me note that.

So, 10a +11d + e must be between 10*1 +11*1 +0=21 and 10*9 +11*9 +9=90 +99 +9=198.

But from equation 3, 10a +11d + e = c +100.

Since c is at most 9, 10a +11d + e is at most 109.

So, 10a +11d + e ≤109.

Given that, let's think about possible values for a and d.

We can write 10a +11d = c +100 - e.

But c and e are digits (0-9), so c +100 - e = 100 + (c - e).

But c - e can vary from -9 to 9. So, 100 + (c - e) ranges from 91 to 109.

Thus, 10a +11d must be between 91 and 109.

So, 91 ≤10a +11d ≤109.

We can write this as 91 ≤10a +11d ≤109.

We can think of possible a and d values that satisfy this.

Since a and d are from 1 to 9, let's list possible pairs (a,d):

Compute 10a +11d for a and d from 1 to 9, and see which ones are between 91 and 109.

Alternatively, let me find the possible a and d.

Let me write 10a +11d = K, where K is from 91 to109.

Let me solve for possible a and d:

10a = K -11d → a = (K -11d)/10.

Since a must be an integer, (K-11d) must be divisible by 10.

So, K-11d ≡0 mod 10.

Which implies 11d ≡ K mod 10.

But 11≡1 mod10, so 11d ≡d mod10. So, d ≡K mod10.

So, for each K from 91 to 109, we have d ≡K mod10.

So, for each K:

d = K mod10.

But d must be 1 to9.

Wait, but K ranges from 91 to109.

So, let's try K from 91 to 109:

For each K, compute d = K mod10.

But for each K, let me find d such that d ≡K mod10, and 10a +11d=K.

So, let's go through each K:

But perhaps it's easier to iterate over possible d from 1 to9 and a from1 to9, and see if 10a +11d is between 91 and109.

Let me make a table:

For each d from1-9:

Compute 11d:

d=1:11 → 10a +11 ≥21 (since a≥1). So, 10a +11 can be 21,31,...,91,101,111, etc.

Wait, but K is up to109. So, for each d, find a such that 10a +11d is between 91 and 109.

Let me compute for each d:

d=1:

11d=11.

So, 10a +11 ≥91 →10a ≥80 →a≥8. Since a can be at most9.

So, a=8 or9.

Check 10*8+11=80+11=91.

10*9+11=90+11=101.

So, for d=1, possible a=8 (K=91) and a=9 (K=101).

Similarly, d=2:

11d=22.

10a +22 ≥91 →10a ≥69 →a≥7.

a can be7,8,9.

a=7:70+22=92.

a=8:80+22=102.

a=9:90+22=112. But 112>109, so a=9 is too big.

So, for d=2, a=7 (K=92), a=8 (102).

d=3:

11d=33.

10a +33 ≥91→10a≥58→a≥5.8→a≥6.

a=6:60+33=93.

a=7:70+33=103.

a=8:80+33=113>109, so a=6 and7.

d=4:

11d=44.

10a +44 ≥91→10a≥47→a≥4.7→a≥5.

a=5:50+44=94.

a=6:60+44=104.

a=7:70+44=114>109. So a=5,6.

d=5:

11d=55.

10a +55 ≥91→10a≥36→a≥3.6→a≥4.

a=4:40+55=95.

a=5:50+55=105.

a=6:60+55=115>109.

So, a=4,5.

d=6:

11d=66.

10a +66 ≥91→10a≥25→a≥
