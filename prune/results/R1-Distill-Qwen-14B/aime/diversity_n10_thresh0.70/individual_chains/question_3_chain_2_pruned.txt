Okay, so I have this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand it step by step.

First, Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S as well. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. If all four of her numbers match, she wins the grand prize. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize means she has all four numbers correct, which is a subset of winning a prize, then A ∩ B is just A. So P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So I need to compute P(A) and P(B), then divide them.

Let me figure out P(A) first. P(A) is the probability that all four of her numbers match the randomly chosen four. Since both Jen and the lottery pick 4 distinct numbers from 10, the total number of possible lottery outcomes is C(10,4), where C(n,k) is the combination formula.

The number of favorable outcomes for P(A) is 1, because there's only one set of four numbers that matches her chosen set. So P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Let me compute C(10,4). C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So P(A) is 1/210.

Now, I need to find P(B), which is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. So P(B) is the probability that in the lottery draw, out of the four numbers chosen, at least two are among the four Jen picked.

Alternatively, it's easier to compute the complement probability, which is the probability of having fewer than two numbers matching, i.e., zero or one number matching. Then subtract that from 1 to get P(B).

So, P(B) = 1 - P(zero matches) - P(one match).

Let me compute P(zero matches). That's the probability that none of the four numbers chosen by the lottery are among Jen's four.

To compute this, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers (since Jen has 4, and S has 10, so 10 - 4 = 6). So the number of ways is C(6,4). So P(zero matches) = C(6,4) / C(10,4).

Similarly, P(one match) is the probability that exactly one of the four numbers chosen is among Jen's four, and the other three are from the remaining six.

The number of ways for this is C(4,1) * C(6,3). So P(one match) = [C(4,1) * C(6,3)] / C(10,4).

Let me compute these step by step.

First, C(6,4) is 15, since 6 choose 4 is same as 6 choose 2, which is (6*5)/(2*1) = 15.

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4*20 = 80.

Therefore, P(zero matches) = 15/210, and P(one match) = 80/210.

So P(B) = 1 - (15/210 + 80/210) = 1 - (95/210) = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. 15 + 80 is 95. 210 - 95 is 115. So yes, 115/210. That simplifies to, let's see, both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5: 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So 23/42. So P(B) = 23/42.

Wait, but hold on, I thought earlier that P(B) was 1 - (15 + 80)/210, which is 1 - 95/210 = 115/210 = 23/42. That seems correct.

But wait, let me think again. So the total number of lottery outcomes is 210. The number of favorable outcomes for B is the number of lottery tickets with at least two numbers matching Jen's four. So the number of such outcomes is C(10,4) - C(6,4) - [C(4,1)*C(6,3)] = 210 - 15 - 80 = 115. So yes,
