Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product of x and y, given that both x and y are greater than 1. The equations provided are logarithmic, and they both equal 10. Let me try to parse this step by step.

First, the problem states:
log base x of y^x equals 10,
and log base y of x^{4y} equals 10.

So, mathematically, that's:
1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but one of the key properties is that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). Maybe I can use that here.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Using that property, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. So, x * log_x(y) = 10.

Wait, I also know that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is the same as 1 / log_y(x). Hmm, not sure if that helps yet, but let me hold onto that thought.

So, from the first equation, x * log_x(y) = 10. Let's denote log_x(y) as some variable to make it easier. Let me call it k. So, k = log_x(y). Then, the first equation becomes x * k = 10. So, x = 10 / k.

But since k = log_x(y), and by the change of base formula, that's equal to ln(y)/ln(x). So, k = ln(y)/ln(x). Therefore, x = 10 / (ln(y)/ln(x)) = 10 * ln(x)/ln(y). Hmm, that seems a bit circular, but maybe I can use this later.

Now, moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Again, using the logarithm power rule, this is 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So, 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Let me denote log_y(x) as m. Then, 4y * m = 10. So, 4y = 10 / m, which implies y = (10)/(4m) = (5)/(2m).

But since m = log_y(x), which is equal to ln(x)/ln(y) by the change of base formula. So, m = ln(x)/ln(y). So, y = 5/(2*(ln(x)/ln(y))) = 5 * ln(y) / (2 * ln(x)).

Wait, but from the first equation, I had x = 10 * ln(x)/ln(y). Let me write that down:

From first equation:
x = 10 * ln(x)/ln(y)  ...(1)

From second equation:
y = 5 * ln(y)/(2 * ln(x))  ...(2)

Hmm, maybe I can express ln(y) in terms of ln(x) from equation (1) and substitute into equation (2). Let's try that.

From (1): x = 10 * ln(x)/ln(y)
=> ln(y) = 10 * ln(x) / x

So, ln(y) = (10 ln x)/x.

Now, substitute this into equation (2):

y = 5 * [ (10 ln x)/x ] / (2 ln x )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

y = 5 * (10 ln x) / (x * 2 ln x )

The ln x terms cancel out:

y = (5 * 10) / (2x )
y = (50)/(2x)
y = 25/x

So, y is 25 divided by x. That's a useful relationship. So, y = 25/x.

Now, I can use this to substitute back into one of the earlier equations. Let's see.

Earlier, from equation (1), ln(y) = (10 ln x)/x.

But since y =25/x, ln(y) = ln(25/x) = ln(25) - ln(x).

So, ln(25) - ln(x) = (10 ln x)/x.

Let me write that equation:

ln(25) - ln(x) = (10 ln x)/x

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can let t = ln(x) to make this equation look simpler. Let's try that.

Let t = ln x. Then, ln(25) = ln(25), and ln(x) = t. So:

ln(25) - t = (10 t)/e^t

Wait, wait, because x = e^t, so 1/x = e^{-t}. Therefore, (10 ln x)/x = 10 t e^{-t}.

So, the equation becomes:

ln(25) - t = 10 t e^{-t}

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation; it might not have a solution in terms of elementary functions. Maybe I can rearrange and see if I can find t.

Bring all terms to one side:

ln(25) - t - 10 t e^{-t} = 0

Or:

ln(25) = t + 10 t e^{-t}

Factor t:

ln(25) = t (1 + 10
