Okay, so I've got this math problem about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

First, every morning Aya walks 9 kilometers. She stops at a coffee shop after her walk, and the time she spends there is 't' minutes. The problem gives me two different scenarios about her walking speed and the total time it takes, including the coffee shop time. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, again including the coffee shop time.

Let me break down the information given.

In the first scenario, she walks at a constant speed of 's' km/h. The walk takes her 4 hours, which includes 't' minutes at the coffee shop. Hmm, wait, 4 hours is the total time including the coffee shop. So, does that mean the walking time itself is 4 hours minus t minutes? Because she spends t minutes in the coffee shop after walking.

Similarly, in the second scenario, she walks at s + 2 km/h, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which again includes 't' minutes at the coffee shop. So, the walking time here would be (2 hours 24 minutes) minus t minutes.

Wait a second, so the total time includes both walking and coffee shop time. So the walk itself is the total time minus 't' minutes.

I think I should convert everything into the same units to make it easier. Let's convert all times into hours because the speed is given in km/h. So, minutes can be converted by dividing by 60.

First scenario:
Total time = 4 hours.
Coffee shop time = t minutes = t/60 hours.
So, walking time = 4 - (t/60) hours.

Distance is 9 km, so using the formula: distance = speed × time.
So, 9 = s × (4 - t/60).

Second scenario:
Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So total time is 2.4 hours.
Coffee shop time is still t minutes, which is t/60 hours.
Walking time = 2.4 - (t/60) hours.

Again, distance is 9 km, so 9 = (s + 2) × (2.4 - t/60).

Now I have two equations with two variables (s and t). I can solve these equations to find s and t.

Let me write them down again:

1) 9 = s * (4 - t/60)
2) 9 = (s + 2) * (2.4 - t/60)

Hmm, so let's denote t/60 as something to make it easier. Let me let x = t/60. Then, the equations become:

1) 9 = s * (4 - x)
2) 9 = (s + 2) * (2.4 - x)

Now, I can write both equations in terms of s and x.

From equation 1: 9 = s*(4 - x) => s = 9 / (4 - x)

From equation 2: 9 = (s + 2)*(2.4 - x)

Let me substitute s from equation 1 into equation 2.

So, equation 2 becomes: 9 = (9/(4 - x) + 2) * (2.4 - x)

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute (9/(4 - x) + 2). Let me write 2 as 2*(4 - x)/(4 - x) to have the same denominator.

So, 9/(4 - x) + 2 = [9 + 2*(4 - x)] / (4 - x)
= [9 + 8 - 2x]/(4 - x)
= (17 - 2x)/(4 - x)

So, equation 2 now is:

9 = [(17 - 2x)/(4 - x)] * (2.4 - x)

Multiply both sides by (4 - x) to eliminate the denominator:

9*(4 - x) = (17 - 2x)*(2.4 - x)

Let me compute each side.

Left side: 9*(4 - x) = 36 - 9x

Right side: Let's expand (17 - 2x)(2.4 - x)

First, multiply 17 by 2.4: 17 * 2.4 = 40.8

17*(-x) = -17x

-2x*2.4 = -4.8x

-2x*(-x) = 2x²

So adding all terms:

40.8 -17x -4.8x + 2x² = 40.8 -21.8x + 2x²

So, right side becomes 2x² -21.8x +40.8

Thus, equation is:

36 -9x = 2x² -21.8x +40.8

Bring all terms to one side:

0 = 2x² -21.8x +40.8 -36 +9x

Simplify the terms:

Combine like terms:

-21.8x +9x = -12.8x

40.8 -36 = 4.8

So, equation becomes:

2x² -12.8x +4.8 = 0

Let me write this as:

2x² -12.8x +4.8 =0

To make it simpler, maybe multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate decimals:

20x² -128x +48 =0

Wait, let me check:

2x² *10=20x²

-12.8x *10= -128x

4.8 *10=48

So yes, 20x² -128x +48 =0

Hmm, perhaps I can divide all terms by a common factor to simplify.

Looking at 20,128,48, they are all divisible by 4.

20 ÷4=5

128 ÷4=32

48 ÷4=12

So, equation simplifies to:

5x² -32x +12=0

Now, let's solve this quadratic equation for x.

Quadratic equation: ax² +bx +c=0

So, a=5, b=-32, c=12

Using the quadratic formula: x = [32 ± sqrt( (-32)^2 -4*5*12 )]/(2*5)

Compute discriminant D:

D= 32^2 -4*5*12 = 1024 - 240 = 784

sqrt(D)=sqrt(784)=28

So,

x = [32 ±28]/10

So two solutions:

x1=(32 +28)/10=60/10=6

x2=(32 -28)/10=4/10=0.4

Now, x = t/60, and time cannot be negative or more than the total time.

Wait, let's check what x represents: x = t/60, where t is the coffee shop time in minutes.

So, x must be positive and less than 4 hours, but let's see.

If x=6, then t=6*60=360 minutes, which is 6 hours. But in the first scenario, total time is 4 hours. If t is 6 hours, that's impossible because coffee shop time can't exceed the total time. So x=6 is invalid.

Thus, the other solution x=0.4 is valid.

So x=0.4 hours, which is t/60=0.4 → t=0.4*60=24 minutes.

So, t=24 minutes.

Now, let's find s using equation 1.

From equation 1: 9 = s*(4 -x)

x=0.4, so 4 -0.4=3.6

Thus,

s = 9 /3.6 = 2.5 km/h

Wait, s=2.5 km/h.

Wait, let me double-check. 2.5 km/h is the walking speed. That seems a bit slow, but okay, maybe.

Wait, let me verify using equation 2.

From equation 2: 9 = (s +2)*(2.4 -x)

s=2.5, so s+2=4.5

2.4 -x=2.4 -0.4=2.0

So, 4.5 * 2.0 =9, which is correct. So that checks out.

So s=2.5, t=24 minutes.

Now, the question is: Suppose Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

So, her new speed is s + 1/2 =2.5 +0.5=3 km/h.

So, the walking speed is 3 km/h.

The distance is still 9 km.

So, walking time is distance / speed =9 /3=3 hours.

So, walking time is 3 hours. But we need to include the coffee shop time of t=24 minutes.

So, total time is 3 hours +24 minutes.

Convert 3 hours to minutes: 3*60=180 minutes.

Add 24 minutes: 180 +24=204 minutes.

So, the total time is 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me make sure. The problem says when she walks at s +1/2 km/h, find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including t minutes.

Yes, so the walk time is 3 hours (walking at 3 km/h), plus 24 minutes (coffee shop), so total is 3 h 24 min, which is 204 minutes.

Wait, but wait a minute: In the original problem, when she walked at s km/h, the total time was 4 hours, including t minutes. So, in that case, 4 hours included walking time plus 24 minutes coffee shop.

Similarly, when she walks at s+2 km/h, the total time is 2 h 24 min, which includes 24 minutes coffee shop.

So, the structure is, for each speed, the total time is (walking time) + (coffee shop time). So, in this scenario, when she walks at 3 km/h, the walking time would be 9 /3 =3 hours, and total time is 3 h +24 min=3 h 24 min=204 minutes.

Therefore, the answer should be 204 minutes. But let me just make sure I haven't made any calculation errors.

Wait, let me confirm the calculations step by step.

We had two equations:

1) 9 = s*(4 -x)
2) 9 = (s +2)*(2.4 -x)

We found x=0.4, so t=24 minutes.

s=9/(4 -0.4)=9/3.6=2.5 km/h.

New speed: 2.5+0.5=3 km/h.

Walking time:9/3=3 hours.

Total time including coffee:3h +24min=204 minutes.

Everything seems to add up.

So, the answer is 204 minutes.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given scenarios and setting up equations based on the provided information.

1. **First Scenario:**
   - Speed = \( s \) km/h
   - Total time including coffee shop = 4 hours = 4.0 hours
   - Coffee shop time = \( t \) minutes = \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours
   - Walking time = \( 4.0 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours
   - Distance = 9 km
   - Equation: \( 9 = s \left(4 - \frac{t}{60}\right) \)

2. **Second Scenario:**
   - Speed = \( s + 2 \) km/h
   - Total time including coffee shop = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2.4 hours
   - Coffee shop time = \( t \) minutes = \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours
   - Walking time = \( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours
   - Distance = 9 km
   - Equation: \( 9 = (s + 2) \left(2.4 - \frac{t}{60}\right) \)

Let \( x = \frac{t}{60} \), converting minutes to hours. The equations become:
1. \( 9 = s (4 - x) \)
2. \( 9 = (s + 2) (2.4 - x) \)

From the first equation:
\[ s = \frac{9}{4 - x} \]

Substitute \( s \) into the second equation:
\[ 9 = \left(\frac{9}{4 - x} + 2\right) (2.4 - x) \]
Simplify and solve:
\[ 9 = \frac{17 - 2x}{4 - x} (2.4 - x) \]
\[ 36 - 9x = 2x^2 - 21.8x + 40.8 \]
\[ 2x^2 - 12.8x + 4.8 = 0 \]
Multiply by 10:
\[ 20x^2 - 128x + 48 = 0 \]
Divide by 4:
\[ 5x^2 - 32x + 12 = 0 \]
Using the quadratic formula:
\[ x = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{784}}{10} = \frac{32 \pm 28}{10} \]
Solutions: \( x = 6 \) (invalid as it exceeds total time) and \( x = 0.4 \).

Thus, \( x = 0.4 \) hours, so \( t = 0.4 \times 60 = 24 \) minutes.

From \( s = \frac{9}{4 - 0.4} = 2.5 \) km/h.

When walking at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h:
- Walking time = \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) hours.
- Total time including coffee = \( 3 \) hours \( 24 \) minutes = 204 minutes.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{204}
\]
