Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (a point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance is supposed to be in the form m√n / p, and then I have to find m + n + p.

First, let me recall what a tetrahedron is. A tetrahedron is a 3D shape with four triangular faces, six edges, and four vertices. In this case, the tetrahedron is labeled ABCD.

The edges have specific lengths:
- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

Hmm, so it's a kind of symmetric tetrahedron. Each pair of opposite edges has the same length. That might mean it's a "balanced" tetrahedron, which could have some nice properties. Maybe it's isohedral or something? Not sure, but perhaps that symmetry can help later.

The point I is the incenter, which in a tetrahedron is the point where all the internal angle bisectors meet, and it's equidistant from all four faces. In 2D, for a triangle, the inradius can be found using the formula r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semi-perimeter. I wonder if there's a similar formula for a tetrahedron.

Yes, in 3D, the formula for the inradius r is the volume V divided by the surface area S (or more specifically, the total area of all faces divided by 3, but I need to double-check that). Wait, no, in 3D, the formula is r = 3V / A, where A is the total surface area. Let me confirm that.

Yes, for a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius is r = 3V / A, where V is the volume and A is the sum of the areas of all four faces. So that's the formula I need to use.

So to find r, I need to compute the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area A. Then, r = 3V / A.

Alright, so the steps are:
1. Calculate the volume V of tetrahedron ABCD.
2. Calculate the areas of each of the four faces.
3. Sum the areas to get A.
4. Plug V and A into r = 3V / A.
5. Simplify the expression for r into the given form.

Let me start with step 1: Calculating the volume V.

I remember that for a tetrahedron, the volume can be found using the Cayley-Menger determinant. The formula is:

V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant. The determinant is a 5x5 matrix constructed from the edge lengths.

But wait, I also need to remember the exact formula. Let me recall.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for points A, B, C, D in 3D space is given by the determinant of the following matrix:

| 0     1      1      1      1     |
| 1     0    AB²   AC²   AD²  |
| 1   AB²    0    BC²   BD²  |
| 1   AC²  BC²     0    CD²  |
| 1   AD²  BD²   CD²     0    |

So the determinant is 5x5. The volume is then sqrt( |CM| / 288 ).

Wait, but actually, the determinant is 5x5, and the formula is:

V² = |CM| / 288

So V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 )

But since all the edges are given, I can construct this determinant.

Given that, let me assign the edge lengths:

AB = CD = √41 →
