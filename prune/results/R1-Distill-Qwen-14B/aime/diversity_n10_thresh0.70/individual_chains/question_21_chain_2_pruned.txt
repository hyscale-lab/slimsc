Okay, so I have this problem about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to understand it step by step.

First, the problem says that for an integer b ≥ 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:

1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. So, in base b, n is written as something like "d1 d0", where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number in base b, n must be between b (which is 10_b) and b² - 1 (which is (b-1)(b-1)_b).

2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. So if n is d1*d0 in base b, then d1 + d0 = sqrt(n).

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful. Let me check that. In base 13, 81 is written as 6*13 + 3 = 81. So the digits are 6 and 3. Their sum is 6 + 3 = 9, and sqrt(81) is 9, so that works.

The question is asking for the least integer b ≥ 2 such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So we need to find the smallest base b where there are at least 11 such numbers n.

Alright, let's break this down.

First, let's formalize the conditions.

If n is a two-digit number in base b, then n can be expressed as:

n = d1 * b + d0

where d1 and d0 are digits in base b, so they must satisfy 0 ≤ d0 ≤ b-1 and 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b-1 (since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero).

The second condition is that d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). Let me write that as:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1 * b + d0)

If I square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1 * b + d0

Let me write that out:

d1² + 2*d1*d0 + d0² = d1 * b + d0

Rearranging terms:

d1² + 2*d1*d0 + d0² - d1*b - d0 = 0

Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of d1 and d0. But maybe I can find a different approach.

Since n is a two-digit number in base b, n must satisfy:

b ≤ n ≤ b² - 1

Also, sqrt(n) must be an integer because d1 + d0 is an integer (sum of two integers). So n must be a perfect square. Let me denote sqrt(n) as s, so s must be an integer, and n = s².

Then the condition becomes:

d1 + d0 = s

But n = s² = d1 * b + d0

So we have two equations:

1. s = d1 + d0
2. s² = d1 * b + d0

Let me substitute equation 1 into equation 2. From equation 1, d0 = s - d1.

Substituting into equation 2:

s² = d1 * b + (s - d1)

Simplify:

s² = d1 * b + s - d1

Let me rearrange terms:

s² - s = d1 * (b - 1)

So,

d1 = (s² - s) / (b - 1)

Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1 (as a digit in base b), this fraction must result in an integer. Therefore, (b - 1) must divide (s² - s). So, (b - 1) | (s² - s).

Which means that (b - 1) must be a divisor of s(s - 1). Since s and s-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. So (b - 1) must divide the product s(s - 1), but since s and s-1 are coprime, (b - 1) must divide either s or s-1.

Wait, is that necessarily true? Because if (b-1) is a divisor of s(s-1), since s and s-1 are coprime, (b-1) can be expressed as a product of two coprime numbers, one dividing s and the other dividing s-1. But perhaps more importantly, (b-1) can be any divisor of s(s-1). Hmm, maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, let's consider that for each s, we can find b such that (b - 1) divides s(s - 1). Then, d1 = (s² - s)/(b - 1). Once d1 is known, d0 = s - d1.

But we also have constraints on d0: d0 must be a digit in base b, so 0 ≤ d0 ≤ b - 1.

Similarly, d1 must be at least 1 and at most b - 1.

So, for each base b, we can look for s such that s² is a two-digit number in base b, and the above conditions hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to fix s and express b in terms of s.

Let me try that.

From earlier, we have:

d1 = (s² - s)/(b - 1)

But d1 must be between 1 and b - 1. So:

1 ≤ (s² - s)/(b - 1) ≤ b - 1

Let me rewrite that:

1 ≤ (s² - s)/(b - 1) ≤ b - 1

Multiply all parts by (b - 1):

b - 1 ≤ s² - s ≤ (b - 1)^2

Wait, that might not be the best approach. Let's see
