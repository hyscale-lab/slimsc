Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So, the torus T is created by revolving this circle around an axis that's 6 units away from its center.

Now, there's another sphere S with radius 11. The problem says that when the torus rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. And when it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay, so first, I should probably figure out the properties of the torus. A torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of rotation, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. Here, R is 6 and r is 3. So, T has R=6 and r=3.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere S (radius 11), it's tangent internally. That means the torus is sitting inside the sphere, touching it along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's externally tangent along another circle.

I think I need to find the radii of these circles of tangency, r_i and r_o, and then subtract them.

Let me think about the internal tangent case first. The sphere has radius 11, and the torus is inside it. The torus will touch the sphere at exactly one point, but wait, no, it's tangent along a circle. So, the point of tangency is a circle.

Wait, actually, when you have a torus inside a sphere and they are tangent, the point of tangency is a circle. So, the sphere and the torus share a common circle where they are tangent.

I remember that in such cases, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the generating circle of the torus must be equal to the sum or difference of their radii, depending on whether it's internal or external.

Wait, but the torus is a bit more complicated because it's a surface of revolution. So, perhaps I should model the torus as a surface in 3D space and find the locus where it touches the sphere.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a geometric relationship that connects the sphere and the torus tangency.

Let me think about the torus equation. In Cartesian coordinates, a torus can be represented as (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2, where R is the major radius and r is the minor radius. But since the problem is symmetric around the axis, perhaps I can consider it in cylindrical coordinates, which might simplify things.

In cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z), the torus equation becomes (ρ - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2.

So, for our torus, R = 6 and r = 3. So the equation would be (ρ - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.

Now, the sphere S has radius 11, so its equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121.

We need to find the points where the torus is tangent to the sphere. Since both are surfaces of revolution around the same axis (assuming the torus's axis is aligned with, say, the z-axis), the points of tangency will lie in a plane perpendicular to the z-axis. So, in cylindrical coordinates, this would be a constant z value.

Wait, no, actually, the points of tang
