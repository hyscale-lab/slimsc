Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

It says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I. The line IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product of AB and AC, which is AB · AC.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by recalling some concepts. The circumcenter O is the center of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC, and the incenter I is the center of the inscribed circle. 

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, that seems like an important condition. Maybe I can use that somehow to relate the sides of the triangle or other properties.

First, let me note down the given values:

- Circumradius (R) = 13
- Inradius (r) = 6
- IA ⊥ OI

We need to find AB · AC.

I remember that in a triangle, the product of two sides can sometimes be related to other elements. Maybe using the area or some trigonometric identities.

Let me think about the inradius and circumradius. I know that the area (Δ) of triangle ABC can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter (s): Δ = r * s.

Also, the area can be expressed in terms of the circumradius and the sides: Δ = (a * b * c) / (4R), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.

But wait, in this problem, we don't know all the sides, only AB and AC. So maybe I need another approach.

Let me consider the coordinates. Perhaps placing the triangle in a coordinate system might help. Let me try to set it up.

Let me suppose that point I is at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), OI is a line from I to O, and IA is another line from I to A. Their dot product should be zero because they are perpendicular.

Wait, if I is at (0,0), then O is at some point (h, k), and A is at some point (x, y). Then, vector IA is (x, y), and vector OI is (h, k). Their dot product is x*h + y*k = 0.

But maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps using vector geometry or coordinate geometry could help, but maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, I can think about the properties involving the inradius and circumradius. There's a formula that relates R, r, and the distance between the incenter and circumradius, OI. The formula is OI² = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no, I think it's OI² = R² - 2Rr. Let me check.

Yes, Euler's formula in triangle geometry states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI² = R(R - 2r). So, in this case, OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13).

But wait, in this problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. So perhaps we can use some right triangle properties here.

Let me think about triangle IA O. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle IA O is a right-angled triangle at I. So in triangle IAO, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, by Pythagoras, OA² = IA² + OI².

Wait, OA is the distance from O to A. But OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So OA = 13. IA is the distance from incenter I to vertex A. Let me denote IA as some length, say, d.

So OA² = IA² + OI² => 13² = d² + (sqrt(13))² => 169 = d² + 13 => d² = 156 => d = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).

So IA, the length from inradius center I to vertex A, is 2*sqrt(39).

Hmm, okay, now that I have that, maybe I can relate IA to other triangle elements.

I recall that the length from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's angles and inradius. Specifically, IA = r / sin(A/2), where r is the inradius and A is the angle at vertex A.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. In the inradius properties, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed as IA = r / sin(A/2). Because in the right triangle formed by the inradius and the angle bisector, the distance from the inradius to the vertex is indeed r / sin(angle/2).

So, IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2). But earlier, I found that IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). So, 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39). Let's solve for sin(A/2):

sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = 3*sqrt(39)/39 = sqrt(39)/13.

Wait, because 3/sqrt(39) can be rationalized as 3*sqrt(39)/39, which simplifies to sqrt(39)/13.

So sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

Hmm, okay. Now, from this, I can find cos(A/2) as sqrt(1 - (sqrt(39)/13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 39/169) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.

Alternatively, I can compute it as:

cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - sin²(A/2)) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.

That's correct.

Now, another thought: In triangle ABC, the sides can be related to the angles and the radii.

The sides can be expressed using the formula a = 2R sin A, where a is the side opposite angle A. Wait, but in this case, AB and AC are sides adjacent to angle A. Wait, let me clarify.

Wait, in triangle ABC, the sides opposite angles A, B, C are a, b, c, respectively. So, side BC is a, AC is b, and AB is c.

But perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, since we're dealing with angle A, and looking for AB and AC, which are sides adjacent to angle A.

Wait, AB is opposite to angle C, and AC is opposite to angle B. Hmm.

Alternatively, I can think about the formula for AB and AC in terms of the inradius and the semiperimeter.

Wait, in a triangle, the lengths from the inradius to the vertices are given by IA = r / sin(A/2), IB = r / sin(B/2), IC = r / sin(C/2). So we already have IA.

Also, the semiperimeter, s, is equal to (a + b + c)/2.

Moreover, the area, Δ, is equal to r * s. We also have that Δ = (a * b * c) / (4R). So perhaps we can relate these.

But the problem is that we have three variables: a, b, c, so with more equations, we can solve them. But let's see if we can find AB · AC, which would be c * b, perhaps.

Wait, in triangle ABC, AB is c, AC is b, so AB · AC is b * c.

So perhaps if I can find bc, then that's the answer.

Let me think about the relations.

We can also use the formula that relates the product of two sides to the area and the sine of the included angle. So, bc = 2Δ / sin A. Hmm, because area Δ = (1/2) * bc * sin A.

So, if I can find sin A, then I can find bc if I know Δ.

Alternatively, if I can find cos A, then perhaps I can use the Law of Cosines.

Wait, let me think about angle A. Since we have sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), perhaps we can find sin A and cos A.

Yes, using double-angle formulas:

sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = 2*sqrt(39*130)/169.

Let me compute that numerator: 39 * 130 = 39*13*10 = 507*10 = 5070. So sqrt(5070) is sqrt(5070). Wait, 5070 is 507 * 10, and 507 is 13*39. Hmm, 5070 = 13*39*10 = 13*13*3*10 = 13² * 3 * 10. So sqrt(5070) = 13*sqrt(30).

So sin A = 2*(13*sqrt(30)) / 169 = (26 sqrt(30)) / 169 = (2 sqrt(30)) / 13.

Wait, let me recheck that calculation.

Wait, 39 * 130 = 39 * 130. 39*100=3900, 39*30=1170; total is 3900+1170=5070. So sqrt(5070)=sqrt(507*10)=sqrt(13*39*10)=sqrt(13*13*3*10)=13*sqrt(30). Yes, so sqrt(5070)=13*sqrt(30). So sin A = 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = 2*(sqrt(39*130))/169 = 2*(13*sqrt(30))/169.

Wait, sqrt(39)*sqrt(130)=sqrt(39*130)=sqrt(5070)=13*sqrt(30), so sin A = 2*(13 sqrt(30)) / (13*13) = 2*sqrt(30)/13. Correct.

So sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13.

So then, as I thought before, bc = 2Δ / sin A. So if I can find Δ, then I can compute bc.

But Δ can be found as r*s, where s is the semiperimeter, and also as (a b c)/(4R). Hmm.

Wait, let me try both expressions.

First, let's compute Δ as r*s. So Δ = r * s = 6 * s.

Also, Δ = (a b c)/(4R) = (a b c)/(4*13) = (a b c)/52.

But we don't know a, b, c. Alternatively, perhaps we can find another expression for Δ.

Wait, we can also express Δ in terms of the inradius and exradius, but that might not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula that relates the sides and the angles.

Wait, another formula: The area can be expressed as Δ = (1/2) * b * c * sin A, which we have as Δ = (1/2) * b * c * (2 sqrt(30)/13) = (b c sqrt(30))/13.

But we also have Δ = 6 s.

So, 6 s = (b c sqrt(30))/13.

Hmm, but without knowing s or bc, this might not be directly helpful. Let me see if I can find another equation involving s.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula that relates R, r, and s: R = (a b c) / (4 Δ). But again, that's the same as the earlier formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula that relates s with R and r. I remember that in a triangle, s = (a + b + c)/2, but I don't recall a direct formula connecting s, R, and r. Maybe we need to relate the distance OI with other elements.

Wait, earlier, we found OI² = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13. So OI = sqrt(13).

We also have that in triangle IAO, which is right-angled at I, we have OI = sqrt(13), IA = 2 sqrt(39), OA = 13.

Wait, another thought: maybe using trigonometric identities in triangle IAO.

Wait, triangle IAO is right-angled at I, so we can relate angles.

Alternatively, perhaps using vectors or coordinates is a better approach. Let me try setting up a coordinate system.

Let me place point I at (0,0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and point O is at some (h, k), point A is at some (x, y). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero: x*h + y*k = 0.

But OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So the distance from O to A is 13: sqrt( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 ) = 13.

Also, since I is the inradius center, it's located at the intersection of the angle bisectors. Maybe this is getting too complicated, but perhaps there's a way to find coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumradius.

Wait, I think I have enough information to relate the sides now.

Wait, another approach: in triangle ABC, we can use the formula that relates the sides, inradius, and circumradius.

We have the formula: r = (Δ) / s, and R = (a b c) / (4 Δ).

Also, we have the formula that relates the distance between inradius and circumradius: OI² = R² - 2 R r, which we already used.

Wait, maybe I can express the sides in terms of the angles.

Wait, the sides can be expressed as a = 2 R sin A, b = 2 R sin B, c = 2 R sin C.

Since R is 13, a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.

So, AB = c = 26 sin C, AC = b = 26 sin B.

So, AB · AC = (26 sin C) * (26 sin B) = 676 sin B sin C.

Hmm, okay. So if I can find sin B and sin C, I can compute AB · AC.

But how?

Wait, in triangle ABC, angles A + B + C = π. So, B + C = π - A.

We also have that sin B sin C can be expressed in terms of cos(B - C) - cos(B + C) all over 2.

Wait, let me recall the identity: sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)] / 2.

Since B + C = π - A, we have:

sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - cos(π - A)] / 2.

But cos(π - A) = - cos A, so:

sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) + cos A] / 2.

Hmm, that might not be directly helpful, but perhaps if I can find cos A, then I can proceed.

We already have sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13, so cos A can be found as sqrt(1 - sin² A) = sqrt(1 - (4*30)/169) = sqrt(1 - 120/169) = sqrt(49/169) = 7/13.

So cos A = 7/13.

So, sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) + 7/13]/2.

Hmm, I don't know cos(B - C) yet, so maybe this isn't helpful.

Alternative approach: Maybe use the formula that connects the inradius, semiperimeter, and the sides.

We have r = Δ / s => 6 = Δ / s => Δ = 6s.

Also, Δ = (a b c)/(4 R) = (a b c)/52.

So, 6s = (a b c)/52 => a b c = 312 s.

But a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.

So, a b c = (26)^3 sin A sin B sin C = 17576 sin A sin B sin C.

Setting this equal to 312 s:

17576 sin A sin B sin C = 312 s => s = (17576 / 312) sin A sin B sin C.

Hmm, this might not be the most straightforward path.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula that relates r, R, and the angles.

Wait, another formula: In any triangle, r = 4 R sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2).

We have r = 6, R = 13.

So, 6 = 4 * 13 * sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2) => 6 = 52 sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2) => sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2) = 6 / 52 = 3 / 26.

But we already found sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. So,

[ sqrt(39)/13 ] * sin(B/2) sin(C/2) = 3 / 26

=> sin(B/2) sin(C/2) = (3 / 26) * (13 / sqrt(39)) ) = (3 * 13) / (26 sqrt(39)) ) = (3) / (2 sqrt(39)).

Simplify denominator: 2 sqrt(39) = sqrt(4*39) = sqrt(156).

So, sin(B/2) sin(C/2) = 3 / sqrt(156) = 3 sqrt(156) / 156 = sqrt(156)/52.

Wait, sqrt(156)=2 sqrt(39), so this is 2 sqrt(39)/52 = sqrt(39)/26.

So, sin(B/2) sin(C/2) = sqrt(39)/26.

Hmm, not sure if this helps directly, but I'll keep it in mind.

Another thought: Maybe using the formula for the length of the angle bisector or something, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps using the formula that relates IA, which we found earlier, with other quantities.

We have IA = 2 sqrt(39), and IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2). As we found earlier, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, which matches.

But perhaps using other relations: In triangle ABC, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the semiperimeter and the sides.

Wait, I recall that IA = sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2), where s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite angle A.

So, IA² = r² + (s - a)².

We have IA = 2 sqrt(39), so IA² = 4*39=156.

So, 156 = 6² + (s - a)^2 => 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 => (s - a)^2 = 120 => s - a = sqrt(120) = 2 sqrt(30).

Therefore, s - a = 2 sqrt(30).

So, s = a + 2 sqrt(30).

Hmm, okay. Now, s is the semiperimeter: s = (a + b + c)/2.

So, (a + b + c)/2 = a + 2 sqrt(30) => (a + b + c) = 2a + 4 sqrt(30) => b + c = a + 4 sqrt(30).

Hmm, so b + c = a + 4 sqrt(30). Interesting.

Also, we know that a = 26 sin A, and we found sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13.

So, a = 26 * (2 sqrt(30)/13) = (26/13)*2 sqrt(30) = 2*2 sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30).

So, a = 4 sqrt(30).

So, from earlier, b + c = a + 4 sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30) + 4 sqrt(30) = 8 sqrt(30).

So, b + c = 8 sqrt(30).

Hmm, okay. So, sum of sides b and c is 8 sqrt(30).

But we need the product bc.

Wait, if I can find bc, then that's our answer.

We also have from earlier, that Δ = 6 s.

And from the area formula, Δ = (a b c)/(4 R) = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c ) / (4 * 13) ) = ( sqrt(30) * b * c ) / 13.

So, 6 s = ( sqrt(30) * b * c ) / 13.

But s = a + 2 sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30) + 2 sqrt(30) = 6 sqrt(30).

So, s = 6 sqrt(30).

So, 6 * 6 sqrt(30) = ( sqrt(30) * b * c ) / 13.

Compute left side: 36 sqrt(30).

Set equal: 36 sqrt(30) = ( sqrt(30) * b * c ) / 13 => Multiply both sides by 13:

36 * 13 * sqrt(30) = sqrt(30) * b * c.

Divide both sides by sqrt(30):

36 * 13 = b * c => 468 = b * c.

So, bc = 468.

Therefore, AB · AC = b * c = 468.

Wait, that seems straightforward once we broke it down.

Let me recap:

1. Found OI using Euler's formula: OI² = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13-12)=13, so OI= sqrt(13).

2. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle IAO is right-angled at I. So, OA² = IA² + OI² => 13² = IA² + 13 => IA² = 156 => IA=2 sqrt(39).

3. Expressed IA in terms of r and sin(A/2): IA = r / sin(A/2) => 2 sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2) => sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13, cos(A/2)=sqrt(130)/13.

4. Found sin A using double-angle formula: sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13)= 2 sqrt(5070)/169 = 2*13*sqrt(30)/169 = 2 sqrt(30)/13.

5. Expressed a = 2 R sin A = 26*(2 sqrt(30)/13)=4 sqrt(30).

6. Used the formula IA² = r² + (s - a)^2 => 156 =36 + (s - a)^2 => s - a=2 sqrt(30) => s= a + 2 sqrt(30) =4 sqrt(30) + 2 sqrt(30)=6 sqrt(30).

7. Expressed s = (a + b + c)/2 =6 sqrt(30) => a + b + c=12 sqrt(30). Since a=4 sqrt(30), then b + c=8 sqrt(30).

8. Expressed area Δ in two ways: Δ=6 s=36 sqrt(30) and Δ=(a b c)/(4 R)= (4 sqrt(30)*b*c)/(52)= (sqrt(30) b c)/13.

9. Equated the two expressions: 36 sqrt(30)= (sqrt(30) b c)/13 => b c= (36 sqrt(30)*13)/sqrt(30)=36*13=468.

So, AB · AC = bc=468.


To solve the problem, we start by noting the given values: the circumradius \( R = 13 \), the inradius \( r = 6 \), and the condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). 

Using Euler's formula, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r) = 13(13 - 12) = 13 \implies OI = \sqrt{13}.
\]
Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( IAO \) is right-angled at \( I \). By the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
OA^2 = IA^2 + OI^2 \implies 13^2 = IA^2 + (\sqrt{13})^2 \implies 169 = IA^2 + 13 \implies IA^2 = 156 \implies IA = 2\sqrt{39}.
\]
The length \( IA \) can also be expressed as \( IA = \frac{r}{\sin(A/2)} \). Substituting \( IA = 2\sqrt{39} \) and \( r = 6 \):
\[
2\sqrt{39} = \frac{6}{\sin(A/2)} \implies \sin(A/2) = \frac{6}{2\sqrt{39}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{39}} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}.
\]
Using the double-angle identity for sine:
\[
\sin A = 2\sin(A/2)\cos(A/2) = 2\left(\frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}\right)\left(\frac{\sqrt{130}}{13}\right) = \frac{2\sqrt{5070}}{169} = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13}.
\]
The side \( a \) opposite angle \( A \) is given by \( a = 2R\sin A \):
\[
a = 26 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} = 4\sqrt{30}.
\]
Using the formula \( IA^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2 \):
\[
156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 \implies (s - a)^2 = 120 \implies s - a = 2\sqrt{30}.
\]
Thus, the semiperimeter \( s = a + 2\sqrt{30} = 4\sqrt{30} + 2\sqrt{30} = 6\sqrt{30} \).

The area \( \Delta \) of the triangle can be expressed as:
\[
\Delta = r \cdot s = 6 \cdot 6\sqrt{30} = 36\sqrt{30}.
\]
Using the formula \( \Delta = \frac{abc}{4R} \):
\[
36\sqrt{30} = \frac{4\sqrt{30} \cdot b \cdot c}{52} \implies 36\sqrt{30} = \frac{\sqrt{30} \cdot b \cdot c}{13}.
\]
Solving for \( bc \):
\[
36\sqrt{30} \cdot 13 = \sqrt{30} \cdot b \cdot c \implies b \cdot c = 36 \cdot 13 = 468.
\]
Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC = bc = 468 \).

**Answer:** \(\boxed{468}\)
