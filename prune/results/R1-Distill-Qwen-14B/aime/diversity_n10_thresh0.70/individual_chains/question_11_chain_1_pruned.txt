Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It says: Find the largest possible real part of [(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z] where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what’s being asked. I need to maximize the real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, with the condition that the magnitude of z is 4. So, |z| = 4. That means z is a complex number lying on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4.

I remember that for any complex number z, if |z| = r, then 1/z is equal to the conjugate of z divided by r squared. So, maybe that can help simplify the expression. Let me write that down:

If |z| = 4, then 1/z = (z̄) / |z|² = z̄ / 16. So, 1/z is (z̄)/16.

So, the expression becomes: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)(z̄)/16.

Let me simplify the second term: (96 + 144i)/16 is equal to (96/16) + (144i)/16, which is 6 + 9i. So, the expression is (75 + 117i)z + (6 + 9i)z̄.

So now, the expression is (75 + 117i)z + (6 + 9i)z̄. Let me write that as E = (75 + 117i)z + (6 + 9i)z̄.

I need to find the maximum real part of E. So, Re(E) is what I need to maximize.

Since z is a complex number, I can express it in terms of its real and imaginary parts. Let me let z = x + yi, where x and y are real numbers, and x² + y² = 16 because |z| = 4.

Then, z̄ = x - yi.

So, substituting z and z̄ into E:

E = (75 + 117i)(x + yi) + (6 + 9i)(x - yi).

Let me expand each term separately.

First term: (75 + 117i)(x + yi)
= 75x + 75yi + 117i x + 117i * yi
= 75x + 75yi + 117xi + 117y i²
= 75x + (75y + 117x)i + 117y (-1)
= 75x - 117y + (75y + 117x)i.

Second term: (6 + 9i)(x - yi)
= 6x -6yi +9i x -9i * yi
= 6x -6yi +9xi -9y i²
= 6x + ( -6y +9x )i -9y (-1)
= 6x +9y + (-6y +9x)i.

So, adding both terms together:

E = [75x - 117y +6x +9y] + [ (75y + 117x) + (-6y +9x) ]i.

Combine like terms:

Real part: (75x +6x) + (-117y +9y) = 81x - 108y.

Imaginary part: (75y +117x -6y +9x) = (75y -6y) + (117x +9x) = 69y +126x.

So, E = (81x - 108y) + (126x + 69y)i.

Therefore, the real part of E is 81x - 108y.

So, Re(E) = 81x - 108y.

Now, I need to maximize Re(E) = 81x - 108y, given that x² + y² = 16.

Hmm, this is a linear expression in x and y, and the constraint is a circle. The maximum of a linear function over a circle occurs at the point where the vector (81, -108) is in the same direction as the position vector (x, y). So, this is like finding the maximum value of a dot product.

Wait, more formally, the maximum of 81x -108y over x² + y² = 16 is equal to the magnitude of the vector (81, -108) multiplied by the magnitude of (x, y), which is 4. Because the maximum occurs when (x, y) is in the direction of (81, -108).

So, the maximum value is |(81, -108)| * 4.

Let me compute |(81, -108)|.

First, the magnitude is sqrt(81² + (-108)^2) = sqrt(6561 + 11664) = sqrt(18225) = 135.

So, the maximum value is 135 * 4 = 540.

Wait, but hold on. Because the expression is 81x - 108y. So, the maximum of 81x -108y is equal to the magnitude of the vector (81, -108) multiplied by the magnitude of (x, y), because by Cauchy-Schwarz, the maximum is achieved when (x, y) is in the same direction as (81, -108). Since |z| = 4, |(x, y)| = 4.

So, |(81, -108)| = sqrt(81² + 108²) as I calculated, which is 135.

Therefore, the maximum of Re(E) is 135 * 4 = 540.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, you might have to consider other factors, but in this case, since we expressed Re(E) in terms of x and y, and the constraint is x² + y² = 16, which is a circle, the maximum of a linear function on a circle is indeed the magnitude of the gradient vector times the radius, as I used.

So, that should be correct.

Alternatively, I could have used Lagrange multipliers, but that's more complicated. Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is straightforward here.

So, the maximum real part is 540.


To solve the problem, we start by expressing the given complex expression in terms of \( z \) and its conjugate \( \overline{z} \). Given \( |z| = 4 \), we know \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \). Substituting this into the expression, we rewrite it as:

\[
(75 + 117i)z + (6 + 9i)\overline{z}
\]

Expressing \( z = x + yi \) and \( \overline{z} = x - yi \) where \( x^2 + y^2 = 16 \), we substitute these into the expression and separate real and imaginary parts. After simplifying, the real part of the expression becomes:

\[
\text{Re}(E) = 81x - 108y
\]

To maximize \( 81x - 108y \) under the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 16 \), we use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The maximum value is the magnitude of the vector \( (81, -108) \) multiplied by the radius of the circle (4). Calculating the magnitude:

\[
\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = 135
\]

Thus, the maximum real part is:

\[
135 \times 4 = 540
\]

The largest possible real part of the given expression is \(\boxed{540}\).
