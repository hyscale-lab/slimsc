Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon (which is a 12-sided polygon). Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I know that in a regular polygon, especially one with many sides like a dodecagon, there are a lot of diagonals and sides. So, the key here is probably figuring out how to count all possible rectangles by considering the sides and diagonals as the sides of these rectangles.

I remember that in a regular polygon, rectangles can be formed by selecting two pairs of parallel sides. Since a regular dodecagon is symmetric, it might be easier to model this using a coordinate system or maybe complex numbers, but perhaps there's a combinatorial way to count them.

Wait, another thought: in a regular polygon, the sides and diagonals can be thought of as vectors. So, if I can find four such vectors that form a rectangle, that would solve the problem. But how do I count all such possible rectangles?

Maybe I should think in terms of selecting two pairs of parallel and equal vectors. For a rectangle, we need two different directions where each direction has two vectors of the same length and they are perpendicular to each other. So, perhaps the problem reduces to finding all pairs of such perpendicular vectors.

But wait, in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can be of different lengths. So, for each possible direction, there are diagonals of varying lengths. Let me recall; in a regular n-gon, the number of different diagonal lengths is n-3. So for a dodecagon, that would be 9 different diagonal lengths. But wait, in addition to the sides, which are like the shortest diagonals. So, in total, along with sides, we have 12 different directions for the sides and diagonals.

Hold on, perhaps I should visualize the dodecagon. Each vertex is connected to 11 others, but each connection can be a side or a diagonal. The sides connect adjacent vertices, and diagonals connect non-adjacent ones.

Now, a rectangle is defined by two pairs of opposite sides that are equal and parallel. So, in the context of the dodecagon, the sides of
