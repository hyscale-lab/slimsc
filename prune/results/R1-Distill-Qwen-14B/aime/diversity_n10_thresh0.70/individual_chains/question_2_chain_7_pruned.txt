Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between O and (1,0), and B is on the y-axis somewhere above O but not as high as (0,1) since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. 

Next, the problem mentions a family of segments PQ, each of unit length, lying in the first quadrant. Point P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment from some point (p,0) to (0,q), with p and q positive, and the distance between P and Q is 1. 

The family F consists of all such segments. So, for every possible p and q where sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1, we have a segment PQ. 

The problem states that there's a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from family F except AB itself. So, C is on AB, and no other PQ from F passes through C except for AB. 

Our goal is to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. They mention it will be a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and we have to find p + q.

Alright, so first, let's try to visualize this setup.

Points O, A, B form a triangle. AB is a line segment connecting (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me compute the equation of AB.

The coordinates of A are (1/2, 0), and B are (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). 

So, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplifying, y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2). 

So any point C on AB can be parametrized as moving from A to B. Let me parametrize AB. Let’s say C is a point on AB such that when moving from A to B, we can write C as (1/2 - t*(1/2), 0 + t*(sqrt(3)/2)) for t from 0 to 1. So, when t=0, we are at A, and when t=1, we are at B. So, the coordinates of C would be (1/2 - t/2, t*sqrt(3)/2). 

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to parametrize using a parameter s, where s is the distance from A to C. Since AB has a certain length, but maybe using a parameter from 0 to 1 is easier. So, point C can be written as ( (1/2)(1 - s), (sqrt(3)/2)s ), where s ranges from 0 to 1.

So, the coordinates of C would be ( (1 - s)/2, (sqrt(3)/2)s ) with s ∈ [0,1].

Now, the key is to find the point C on AB such that C is not on any other segment PQ from family F except AB itself. So, C lies on AB and on no other PQ from F. 

So, for any other segment PQ in F, C is not on PQ. 

So, we need to find such a point C on AB. 

Since all segments PQ are of unit length, with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis, the equation of each PQ can be written as x/p + y/q = 1, where p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Wait, actually, if P is at (p,0) and Q is at (0,q), then the equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1, right? So, that's the intercept form of a line.

So, each PQ is described by the equation x/p + y/q = 1, with p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Now, we need to ensure that the point C is not on any such line except for when PQ is AB itself.

Wait, but AB is already a segment in F? Let me check.

AB is the segment from (1/2,0) to (0,sqrt(3)/2). Let's compute the length of AB: sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So, yes, AB is a segment of F because it's of unit length with P at (1/2,0) and Q at (0, sqrt(3)/2).

So, point C is on AB, and we need to ensure that for all other PQ in F, C is not on PQ. 

So, we're looking for the point C on AB that is not on any other segment PQ in F. 

So, for that, we can consider the set of all lines PQ in F, and find the point C that's on AB but not on any of these lines. Since AB is part of F, we're to find the unique point C that's only on AB and no other PQ.

But how do we find such a point?

One approach is to think about the envelope of all these lines PQ. The envelope would be the set of points where each point is on exactly one line from F. So, the envelope is a curve tangent to each PQ. 

If we can find the envelope of the family F, then the point C must lie on AB but not on the envelope, except at AB itself. Alternatively, perhaps the point C is where AB is tangent to the envelope of F. 

Wait, let me think again. Each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q), with p^2 + q^2 =1. So, for each such PQ, the equation is x/p + y/q =1.

The envelope of this family of lines is a curve that is tangent to each PQ. So,
