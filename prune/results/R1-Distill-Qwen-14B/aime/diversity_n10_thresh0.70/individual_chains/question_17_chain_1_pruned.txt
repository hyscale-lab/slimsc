Okay, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, then express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and finally find p + q. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I remember that for a rectangular box with side lengths a, b, c, the surface area S is given by 2(ab + bc + ac) and the volume V is abc. So in this case, S = 54 and V = 23. So I can write:

2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 => ab + bc + ac = 27.

And abc = 23.

Now, the sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d is given by sqrt(a² + b² + c²). Therefore, the radius r would be half of that: r = d/2. So, r² = (a² + b² + c²)/4.

So, to find r², I need to find a² + b² + c², then divide by 4.

I know that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). I have ab + bc + ac = 27, so if I can find (a + b + c)², then I can subtract 2*27=54 to get a² + b² + c².

But I don't know a + b + c. Hmm, maybe I can relate this somehow with the volume. I know that for a given volume, the expression a² + b² + c² is minimized when the box is a cube. But wait, in our case, the box isn't necessarily a cube because the surface area and volume might not allow that. So perhaps I need to find expressions for a + b + c in terms of known quantities.

Alternatively, maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers or some optimization technique to find the maximum possible value of a² + b² + c² given the constraints, because r² would be maximized when a² + b² + c² is maximized, but wait, no. Wait, the sphere has to contain all boxes in the set B, so the radius r must be at least as big as the largest possible space diagonal from any box in B. Therefore, to find the minimal r, I need to find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B. So, r is the maximum of d over all boxes in B, so r² is the maximum of (a² + b² + c²)/4. So I need to find the maximum value of a² + b² + c² given the constraints ab + bc + ac = 27 and abc = 23.

So, this is an optimization problem: maximize a² + b² + c² subject to ab + bc + ac = 27 and abc = 23.

Hmm, how to approach this. Maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let me set up the function to maximize: f(a,b,c) = a² + b² + c². The constraints are g(a,b,c) = ab + bc + ac = 27 and h(a,b,c) = abc = 23.

So, using Lagrange multipliers, we can set up the system:

∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h.

Calculating the gradients:

∇f = (2a, 2b, 2c)

∇g = (b + c, a + c, a + b)

∇h = (bc, ac, ab)

So, setting up the equations:

2a = λ(b + c) + μ bc

2b = λ(a + c) + μ ac

2c = λ(a + b) + μ ab

And the constraints:

ab + bc + ac =27,

abc=23.

Hmm, that's a system of five equations with five variables: a, b, c, λ, μ.

This looks complicated, but maybe we can find a symmetric solution. Let me assume that two variables are equal, say a = b, to simplify. If a = b, then perhaps the equations become easier.

Let a = b = k, then c is another variable.

So, substituting a = b = k into the constraints:

ab + bc + ac = k² + 2k c =27.

Volume: abc = k² c =23.

So, from volume, c = 23/(k²).

Substitute into surface area:

k² + 2k*(23/k²) =27.

Simplify:

k² + (46/k) =27.

Multiply both sides by k to eliminate denominator:

k
